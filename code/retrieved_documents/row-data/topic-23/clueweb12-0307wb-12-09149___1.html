 Organic search engine listings, to some, are the 
equivalent of life-blood of many sites. With Google and Yahoo driving the 
search engine industry, gaining respectable organic listings within is 
considered to be golden. In fact,Rustybrick of SERoundTable.com, states that 
Google &quot;provides over 70%&quot; search engine traffic that his site 
receives. Compare this to Yahoo Search, which is only responsible for 10% of 
his traffic.<br>
<br>
 How successful has Yahoo been for your traffic? Discuss 
this atWebProWorld.<br>
<br>
 A WebmasterWorld member named Michael_T has this 
story to tell about Yahoo's impact on his search engine traffic:<br>
<br>
 
&quot;I've been paying my Yahoo bills since 1999 / 2000.<br>
<br>
 I'm in two 
directories and I also pay to sponsor two sites. The latter costs $100/ mo each.
<br> <br>
 I get virtually no search traffic from Yahoo, where as Google sends 
me 12,000 per week.<br>
<br>
 I do get visitors from the Yahoo directory 
listing. They do buy, so the ROI is OK.<br>
<br>
 I used to get a lot of Yahoo 
search traffic. I think that was all Google based. Now I get almost nothing 
from Yahoo search.<br>
<br>
 I think they have serious management problems over 
there. I've called Yahoo 4-5 times to run some paid adverts and the guy has not 
returned my calls.&quot;<br>
<br>
 These facts may contribute to some questions 
regarding the effectiveness of the Yahoo search engine. Could the problem lie 
in the idea that Yahoo values Site Match listings over organic listings? Some 
posters around the search engine forums think so. This is an easy conclusion to 
reach being that Yahoo and Yahoo-owned search engines are the only ones 
currently using paid inclusion.<br>
<br>
Get listed in Yahoo! search. $25 bonus.
<br> <br>
<br>
 However, when you consider Michael's post, even sites that he 
has paid listings for aren't performing well. Like Rustybrick, he receives most 
of his search engine traffic from Google.<br>
<br>
 If you peruse the forums, 
you find that there are many topics discussing the lack of traffic coming from 
and the difficulty of maintaining consistent rankings in Yahoo. The speculation 
for the inconsistencies centers on Yahoo's spider Slurp. That and the fact that 
Yahoo no longer uses Google search results.<br>
<br>
 The main complaint about 
Slurp is that it doesn't seem to crawl the web nearly as frequently as 
Google's. A few posts from WebmasterWorld would seem to support this theory.
John_Caius, a senior member at WMW says:<br>
<br>
 &quot;My site has been 
online for two years and has had about 3000 pages of content for over six 
months with plenty of incoming links. We get &gt;10,000 hits from Googlebot per 
month, &gt;10,000 hits from Google's Mediapartners bot (Adsense) per month, but 
only about 500 hits from Yahoo's Slurp bot per month. Google fully indexed the 
content within a few weeks of it going live. Yahoo has never had more than 520 
pages in its index.&quot;<br>
<br>
 And akreider finishes the point with, 
&quot;Google is about 50 times more traffic than Yahoo, ever since Yahoo 
stopped using Google's results. Before that, Google traffic was only 4 times 
that of Yahoo.&quot;<br>
<br>
 So what can be done to help your site's presence 
in Yahoo's search engine? ddogg has a biting comment concerning Yahoo and 
result listings: &quot;Yahoo does a terrible job crawling. They want you to pay 
them for inclusion instead.&quot; This may very well be the case, which is 
reinforced byihelpyou, the administrator at the ihelpyou forums (oddly enough). 
Instead of paying for Site Match, he suggests paying $299 to be indexed into 
Yahoo's directory.<br>
<br>
 According to ihelpyou, &quot;the minute you pay, 
you will be crawled and indexed.&quot; Although, some have speculated that if 
you're already in Yahoo Search's index, submitting to their directory can hurt 
rankings you've established from the free crawl.DaveAtIFG, an administrator at 
WMW says, &quot;There have been reports that a Y(ahoo) directory listing can 
hurt your Y(ahoo) free listing. A title from the directory listing seems to 
have &quot;priority&quot; over a title spidered from a web page. I expect this 
will be corrected, eventually.&quot;<br>
<br>
 As it stands, if ranking in 
Yahoo is important to you, it may be advisable to pay the $300 and join their 
directory. This will ensure your site will be crawled and indexed. As for 
increasing traffic that actually comes from Yahoo, optimize your on page 
content. It seems that Yahoo's ranking algorithm values this more than 
backlinks pointing to your site. Which, of course, is almost in direct contrast 
to Google's ranking procedures.<br>

Thoughts On Google's IPO<br>
<br>

<strong></strong>By <b>Jim Hedger</b><br>
<br>
For the past nine months the 
financial and Internet world has been watching Google in anticipation of what 
could be the largest Initial Public Offering of stock in history. If you are 
reading this column and have not been living on Mars for the past year, you 
know that Google is about to go public, and soon. The stock options are being 
offered to investors using an unorthodox method known as a Dutch Auction. The 
site taking registrations and bids is scheduled to close tomorrow at 5:00PM, 
Eastern Daylight Time.<br>
<br>
 Google has faced unprecedented observation as 
interest in this offering is reminiscent of the hype of the early dot-com era. 
Dispute a week of setbacks which included revelations that Google illegally 
issued stock-options in previous years and a multi-million dollar patent 
settlement with rival Yahoo, the IPO appears to be going forward. The bidding, 
which is limited to citizens of the United States, is expected to range between 
$108 and $135 a share. If shares trade in that price range, Google and its 
current shareholders could see as much as $3.4Biliion, placing the overall 
value of the company around $32Billion - $35Billion. Google recently added 
1.1Million shares to its offering but has allotted them to Yahoo in order to 
pay for a technology licence to continue displaying AdWords in a settlement of 
a long-standing patent suit.<br>

 It seems that I've 
stumbled across two interesting posts that take a different look at the search 
engine wars. The first post byjajit tells about how he thinks Yahoo is the 
bigger search engine and that it's easier to to optimize for.Tell us what you 
think!<br>
<br>
 As for the second post, well pebblez seems to just be 
frustrated with all the efforts to optimize for google and not getting any 
return. See if you canhelp them out.<br>

<p></p> Google vs Yahoo<br>
<br>
 By <strong>jajit</strong><br>
<br>
 Almost 
everyone prefers Google to Yahoo but why? I have found there to be more sites 
listed in Yahoo's database than Google's and have also found it to be far more 
easier to optimize your site for Yahoo. PR can be complicated, as well as many 
other things invloved with Google. However, Yahoo is still including meta 
descriptions when a search is queried.<br>
<br>
 I have found my own site to 
rank well and very well on Yahoo and not even to be found on Google. I don't 
have very high PR's on my sites but that doesn't matter with Yahoo. You can 
optimize and see results with Yahoo. ... &nbsp; <strong>...Click to read more

<p></p> Optimising for yahoo vs google<br>
<br>
 By <strong>pebblez</strong>
<br> <br>
 so ill admit it, im a little bit tiffed at google, and im tired of 
optimizing just for them anyways. In the google forum there are hundreds of 
posts on how to make your site google friendly. You get a good title tag, maybe 
a few others, create keyword dense pages, then lots of links if you can. What 
does yahoo want though? Is it the same thing or is there something specific to 
yahoo?<br>
<br>
 Thanks for the help everyone ... &nbsp; <strong>...Click to
