<br><br>

<p>One of the most effective ways to get free, targeted traffic to your 
website is by being listed in the Major Search Engines.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Being listed doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you&rsquo;re going to get 
traffic. Unless your site garners a good page rank, your traffic may remain 
minimal.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;ll hear from different sources and even from some Gurus that 
SEO (search engine optimization) isn&rsquo;t necessary or is a waste of time. 
It just isn&rsquo;t so! All of the top ranked sites (money making) are 
optimized to get the best ranking possible.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Before listing your site, take the time to optimize it for page ranking. 
Let&rsquo;s take a look at how page rank is determined so you can be prepared...
</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p> 
<h3>How Search Engines Determine Page Rank</h3> 
<p>Each of the major search engines uses its own unique &quot;algorithm&quot; 
or formula to determine page ranking. Algorithm&rsquo;s are kept secret, and 
are changed periodically. Formula changes usually indicate a shift of emphasis 
from one part to another.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the main components targeted in algorithms are keyword 
relevancy, page title, content, number and quality of backlinks (links pointing 
back to your site):</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Keyword Relevancy:</b> is one of the main components in algorithms. This 
is the relationship of a keyword to the page topic. In other words, using the 
word &quot;golf&quot; (a popular keyword) as a keyword in a page discussing how 
to fix a water pipe will not give you a good ranking.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another consideration is the number of keywords in a page or keyword 
density. Too few is considered irrelevant and too many may be deemed as keyword 
stuffing and is frowned upon. A general rule of thumb is 2-3% of the page 
content. If your page is 350 words you should include 7-10 keywords.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Title:</b> The title of your page should describe your page content and 
contain your main keyword for the search engines and should be compelling 
enough to get visitors to click.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Content:</b> I know you&rsquo;ve heard the phrase, &quot;Content is 
King&quot; - and it still is. For page rank your content should include 
keywords as described above, but it shouldalso be well written and informative 
to keep visitors coming back and to compel others to link to your site.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Backlinks:</b> The search engines rate backlinks highly. The belief is 
that if you obtain a lot of backlinks your site must be of importance. Backlink 
quality is rated as well as quantity. In other words, not just any backlink 
will do. SE&rsquo;s are looking for links from other sites of importance and 
quality.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that you know what needs to be done before listing your site, 
let&rsquo;s move on and learn how to get your site listed with the major search 
engines...</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p> 
<h3>The Big 3</h3> 
<p>Out of all the search engines and directories on the Internet the majority 
of traffic comes from The Big 3 - Google, Yahoo and Bing. Many of the others 
actually get their ratings from these three, so once you&rsquo;ve got listings 
in these engines you will automatically be listed in many of the others as well.
</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In case any of you are wondering why Yahoo is listed here when it is 
actually a directory, here is my reasoning: Although technically Yahoo is not 
listed as a search engine it is still one of the big 3 major players in website 
traffic - which makes it appropriate to be included it in this article about 
getting your site listed in the top spots on the Internet traffic highway.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p> 
<h3>Getting Listed in Google</h3> 
<p>1. The easiest way to get listed is by submitting your site directly by 
going here: http://www.google.com/addurl/. Google doesn&rsquo;t necessarily add 
every site, so be sure you have good content and have optimized your pages.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To assist in your chances of being indexed be sure to submit a sitemap. To 
create your sitemap go to http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/, follow the four steps 
there and then save the file to your PC. Now upload to the root directory of 
your fileserver. Next, get your free Google Webmaster account at 
http://www.google.com/webmasters/start/. Log into your new account, add your 
site URL and submit your sitemap.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Another way to get a Google listing is by getting an in-bound link from 
another site - And not just any site will do. You need a link from an 
established site witha high page rank.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>An excellent way to do this is by writing and submitting an article in an 
article directory like eZinearticles.com. eZine Articles is considered an 
authority site by Google and is crawled several times a day. Not only that, but 
articles submitted here are syndicated, and that means more inbound links to 
you - and the more in-bound links the better chance of Google indexing your 
site and giving your site a good page rank.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>3. The third way to get noticed by Google is by listing your site in The 
Open Directory at www.dmoz.org. A listing here will get you listed directly 
into Google, but getting in is difficult. Indexing is done by human volunteers 
and it can sometimes take up to a year to get indexed.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p> 
<h3>Getting Listed in Yahoo</h3> 
<p>When your site is ready go to Yahoo! And using the search box find sites 
that are similar to yours and note the category listing. Then go to 
http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit/ and submit your site in the same 
category. Fill in all of the fields completely and accurately. Now you wait...
</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If your site hasn&rsquo;t been listed in about 6 weeks, resubmit. If 
necessary, keep resubmitting until it&rsquo;s listed. Of all the search engines 
and directories, Yahoo! generates the most hits, so it&rsquo;s definitely worth 
the effort.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also list your site in the Yahoo! Paid directory. There is a belief 
that having a directory listing will boost your rank in Google and other 
engines but there is no proof of this. In fact, being listed in the directory 
isn&rsquo;t even a guarantee of affecting your position in Yahoo&rsquo;s search 
results.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely up to you to decide if it&rsquo;s worth being listed. 
For a commercial site, the cost is $299 a year.</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p> 
<h3>Getting Listed in Bing</h3> 
<p>Bing is Microsoft&rsquo;s new search engine (formerly MSN). It was revamped 
and quickly became one of the major search engines - making it a must do in 
getting your site listed in the search engines. Here are the steps to take to 
submit your site:</p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>1.Check to make sure your site has not been indexed by going to 
http://www.bing.com and placing a search for your site. If your site has been 
indexed already, skip to step 3.</p>
<p>2.Add your site by going to 
http://www.bing.com/webmaster/submitsitepage.aspx. Click on &quot;submit a site 
to Bing&quot; and put your site URL in the box indicated.</p>
<p>3.Add your sitemap by going to http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmasters and 
clicking on the &quot;sign in to use webmaster tools&quot; box. Here you can 
also validate your robots.txt, research keywords and identify crawl issues.</p>
