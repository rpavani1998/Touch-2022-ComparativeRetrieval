<h1>Google, Bing, Yahoo launch Schema.org for structured data</h1> Friday, 
June 3, 2011, 16:33 &nbsp;[IST] <br>

 California, Jun 
3: The ultimate winner is the user! The search engine giants Google, Yahoo and 
Bing put aside their rivalry and joined hands to offer better search result to 
users. Google, Yahoo and Bing announced the launch of a new initiative called 
schema.org.<br>
<br>
The motive behind the schema.org is to create and support 
a common vocabulary for structured data markup on web pages. With schema.org, 
site owners and developers can learn about structured data and improve how 
their sites appear on major search engines.<br>
<br>
&quot;Schema.org aims to 
be a one stop resource for webmasters looking to add markup to their 
pages,&quot; Google said in itsblog. <br>
<br>
The Schema.org provides a 
collection of schemas, or html tags, that webmasters can use to markup their 
pages in ways recognized by major search providers. Search engines including 
Bing, Google and Yahoo rely on this markup to improve the display of search 
results, making it easier for people to find the right web pages.<br>
<br>

&quot;Many sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in 
databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to 
recover the original structured data. Many applications, especially search 
engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data,&quot; 
explained onschema.org. <br>
<br>
On-page markup enable search engines to 
understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in 
order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web. 
Markup can also enable new tools and applications that make use of the 
structure.<br>
<br>
Making the schema.org more relevant, Google introduced 
schemas for more than a hundred new categories, including movies, music, 
organizations, TV shows, products, places and more. Google said that by adding 
these markup to sites, search engines can develop richer search experiences.<br>
