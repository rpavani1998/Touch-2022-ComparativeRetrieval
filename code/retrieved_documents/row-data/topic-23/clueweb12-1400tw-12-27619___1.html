<p>Google analytics gives you an abundance of info on your web site, such as 
amount of website visitors, bounce rate together with other critical indicators 
that can help you increase your web site&rsquo;s conversion rate. And yet did 
you know you can easily apply the data located in Google Analytics to enhance 
your web site&rsquo;s amount of targeted traffic?</p> 
<p>In this post, I plan to reveal to you step by step guidance with regard to 
how you can analyze Google Analytics and find useful keyword info, examine your 
existing web site position and build backlinks to efficiently help your ranking 
in Google, Yahoo! and Bing.</p> 
<h4>Find The Keyword Terms You Are Ranking For Already</h4> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to have Google Analytics turned on for your site for a 
number of months to be able to get the most benefit..</p> 
<p>Open your Google Analytics dashboard and then go into your Traffic Sources. 
After that, look at your organic traffic. If you are utilizing the previous 
version of Google Analytics, it will bring up a listing of the particular 
search phrases people are typing into Google&rsquo;s search engine in order to 
find your site.</p> 
<p>Next, what I do is stretch the list so I can look at the top 250 key 
phrases that people are finding my site for. Take a look through the list for 
the keywords that you are not seeking to rank for. All these keywords are what 
I believe to be the actual golden keyword phrases that potential customers are 
arriving at your site with that you probably actually be familiar with.</p> 
<p>In a perfect world, hunt for keyword phrases which have a good amount of 
monthly searches in Google along with a substantial level of commercial value. 
Look for terms that you know you have content for on your site.</p> 
<h4>Get Your Website&rsquo;s Position</h4> 
<p>Now visit Google and enter in the search term. For example, just follow 
this: &ldquo;keyword phrase&rdquo; &ndash; using no quotes &ndash; and then 
click search.</p> 
<p>You might have to look through many pages to discover your search site.</p> 
<p>At this moment, in the event that your keyword is not on page 1, you might 
be saying to yourself, &ldquo;No one goes beyond the page 1 search engine 
results!&rdquo; You are most likely correct; on the other hand, there is a 
chance that somebody did go looking that far to get to my site. A more likely 
scenario is the fact that my site merely happened to be on page 1 of the Google 
search results at the time this user discovered my site. Because websites move 
around every once in awhile, this really is most likely what actually 
transpired. In either case, it is not important.</p> 
<p>The main thing here is that we have discovered a page on our online site 
that&rsquo;s highly ranked for a keyword phrase that we may not have been 
previously carrying out any search engine ranking optimization for.</p> 
<h4>Building Backlinks For The New Page We Wish To Rank</h4> 
<p>The third step is to promote this page of content by building backlinks to 
it, using the keyword phrase as the anchor text.</p> 
<p>One great way to get a link back to your site is go back to Google and 
search for other blog sites that are relevant to your own. Since my site is 
about SEO, I would probably enter something like &ldquo;SEO blog guest 
post&rdquo; into Google to find sites that might accept a guest blog post from 
me. I would then contact various site owners to see if I can post an article on 
their site, in exchange for a link. Once I have approval, I could write the 
article and include my keyword with a link back to my site, using proper HTML 
syntax.</p> 
<p>Writing one article with one link like this may or may not be enough to 
move your site up in Google. You will need to monitor your search ranking to 
see how you are doing over time. If need be, you may need to submit your 
articles or look for other link building methods to help you rank higher. Or, 
if you do not have the time to do it yourself, you can hire anaffordable SEO 
consultant to help you with link building.</p> 
<p>Imagine the impact you can make on your site&rsquo;s traffic if you repeat 
this process for several different keywords! The idea is to take what is 
already working and make it better.</p>
