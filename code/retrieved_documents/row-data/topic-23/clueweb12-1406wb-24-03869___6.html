<p>If you haven't heard yet, Microsoft and Yahoo! have inked a 10 year deal to 
partner on search and advertising.&nbsp; You canlearn more about the details of 
the deal, which I won't go into here.&nbsp; If the deal is approved by 
regulators, we could see changes in Yahoo and Bing search and advertising early 
next year, from the sound of it.<br>

creating an SEO strategy we will tackle the topic of<strong>community</strong>. 
Websites are not like the &quot;field of dreams&quot; -- if you build it, they 
won't necessarily come. Certainly if you do everything right up to this point: 
write good content, use appropriate markup and install the right Drupal 
modules, the search engines will index your site. However, when you start 
receiving quality inbound links is when your organic search results will 
increase exponentially.

 In Part II of Creating An SEO Strategy, Ron 
focused on content and keywords. But there is more to content than just the 
keywords. The markup and code underneath can make your content even more 
attractive to search engines and help your visitors find what they are looking 
for faster.

<li>3 comments</li> </ul>  During our retreat in Playa Del Carmen MEX over the 
summer,Jacob Singh (now a CivicActions Alumnus, Class of 2008) showed and 
explained to me a project he was working on to create a hosted Solr Search 
service for Drupal.Solr (via the Solr Integration module written and maintained 
by Robert Douglas) provides a method to bring very robust faceted search to 
Drupal sites. A few weeks ago, Jacob went to work with Acquia in order to bring 
this product to the masses. Read aboutAcquia's hosted Solr Search plans.

<h2> Faceted Search as a valid alternative to ApacheSolr </h2>  in

<ul> 
<li>2 comments</li> </ul>  The ApacheSolr module allows the integration of the 
core search module with the power of theApache Solr search platform. Aside from 
better performance the most prominent feature is the addition of faceted 
search. In essence it's a user-friendly manner to search for content by 
filtering on author, content type, taxonomy,... You can try a demonstration on 
the search pages ofRobert Douglass, author of the ApacheSolr module. Now, not 
everyone has the resources to set up a server with Apache Solr, be it an actual 
dedicated server to run the software on or the funds to rent one. Luckily, 
there's also theFaceted Search module that provides similar functionality 
without this extra requirement. You can check out the demonstration byDavid 
Lesieur and see how it compares to Robert's. Faceted Search also has a couple 
of extra features that make it a worthy competitor.

 After a couple months of development. The google

developers and site administrators to plug into google's enterprise search 
offerings (the GoogleMini and the Google Search Appliance). I've written a 
little how-to and announcement on my personal site entitledGoogle Appliance 
Integration with Drupal It is currently in beta, so any lucky google appliance 
users out there, please bang on it! Thanks, J<br>

<li>1 comment</li> </ul>  Surf Canyon, one of my favorite search add-ons to 
improve Google search, auto-updated today - reminding me that I've been meaning 
to share this for the Way We Work. Basically, Surf Canyon helps you find 
information deep within the search results. As you search in Google (or Yahoo 
or MSN), the results you click go on to train Surf Canyon to find links more 
relevant to what you are looking for. In the case of the example image below, 
searching for theMedia Mover module in Google, I am able to quickly find the 
Drupal VideoGroup as well, pulled in from page 3. Surf Canyon works with 
Firefox (and Internet Explorer, if you must).<br>

<h2> Similar content module wrapup </h2>  in

<li>similar content</li> </ul>  |&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>2 comments</li> </ul> 
<p>Here is an (incomplete) rundown of the various 'similar/related node' type 
modules:</p> Manually entered Parsed links Search/analysis of title/body 
Taxonomy Same content type <br>
Related Links &#9786; &#9786; &#9786; &#9786; 
<br> Related Block &#9786; <br>
Similar by Terms &#9786; <br>
Similar Entries 
&#9786; <br>
Relevant Content &#9786; &#9786; <br>
<br>

<p>It should be pointed out that while related links is one of the oldest of 
the bunch, and has most features, it is not quite as flexible as people are 
looking for (which I think is the main reason for the other modules), and the 
UI is not always easy to understand.</p> 
<p>Here is what I would like to see - a module that (on node creation/edition 
and also regularly refreshed on cron) provides a hook to allow various modules 
to add in some numeric factors for how that node relates to other nodes. These 
modules could have their own configuration (e.g. to only pull from certain 
vocabularies), and the central API would allow you to weight one module/factor 
against another (e.g. taxonomy similarity v.s. word similarity v.s. destination 
node votes or freshness).</p> 
<p>It would basically then just dump this information into a table and provide 
it to views as a sort option (that would need to load a node from an NID passed 
in an argument to provide a 'relevant' sort). This would allow you to display 
it per content type or whatever. For bonus points there would be a way for
Content Recommendation Engine or other modules with user specific input to add 
their influence to the final list.</p>
