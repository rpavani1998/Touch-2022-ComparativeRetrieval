<h2>Former Google Employees Launch a Cuil Search Engine</h2> Megan Baker 
<p>Posted:&nbsp;Jul 28th 2008 10:44AM</p>Filed under:&nbsp; St. John Fisher 
College, News, Science 
<p></p>  Anna Patterson's last search engine innovation was so good, Google 
bought it from her in 2004. This time, she's keeping hertechnology to herself. 
Patterson left Google in 2006 to try to develop a better way of surfing the 
web. With the help of her husband, Tom Costello, and two other former Google 
engineers - Russell Power and Louis Monier, she developed Cuil.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Cuil (pronounced &quot;cool&quot;) launched yesterday, calling itself 
&quot;The World's Biggest Search Engine.&quot; Cuil is an old Irish word for 
knowledge and claims to search more pages on the web than anyone else...Google 
included. They believe in analyzing content over analyzing the user, which is a 
different approach for search engines. One of their major promises is that they 
don't log a user's search history, which is a concern for some search engine 
users.<br>
<br>
While Cuil may actually be a better search engine than Google, 
will it really matter?<br>
Right now, not even giants Yahoo! or Microsoft can 
compete. Through May, Google held a 62% share of the U.S. search market with 
Yahoo at 21% and Microsoft at 8.5%, according to comScore Inc. Not only that, 
the name recognition of Google alone is enough for them to not have to worry.
<br> <br>
TechCrunch tested out the two contenders to see which one really is 
better...so far, anyway. They found that &quot;Cuil is an excellent search 
engine, particularly since it is all of an hour old. But it doesn't appear to 
have the depth of results that Google has, despite their claims. And the 
results are not nearly as relevant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Patterson is not a 
disgruntled employee, just someone who didn't like how monotonous Google is. 
Google has looked pretty much the same for 10 years now,&quot; she said, 
&quot;and I can guarantee it will look the same a year from now.&quot;<br>
<br>

The thing is...why fix what isn't broken? Cuil is nice. It has a different look 
and a different feel, but many people have become so accustomed to Google that 
it won't matter just how great other search engines are. Personally, I won't be 
switching over anytime soon.
