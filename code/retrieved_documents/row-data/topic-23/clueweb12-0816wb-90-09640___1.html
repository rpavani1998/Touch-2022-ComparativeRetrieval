<h2>Local Search - Google-vs-Yahoo</h2> 
<p>When setting up local search campaigns start with Google and Yahoo, but 
lets break down each one and go from there!</p> 
<p><strong>Google:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Adwords will allow regional targeting for all accounts.</li> 
<li>You must have a website to use Google Adwords.</li> 
<li>You do not need a physical address.</li> 
<li>You can target by:</li> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li>State</li> 
<li>City</li> 
<li>Metro Area</li> 
<li>Close to an address</li> </ol> 
<ul> 
<li>Ad serving-uses searchers IP address as well as other &ldquo;local 
factors&rdquo;</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Yahoo Overview:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Local Search PPC</li> 
<li>They have a locator page so having a website is optional</li> 
<li>You must have a physical business</li> 
<li>You have to target from 0-100 miles from business location.</li> 
<li>Yahoo serves up ads based on:</li> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li>Searches done for that location</li> 
<li>Registered members users</li> 
<li>Location specific on Yahoo Local</li> </ol> 
<p>When setting up local search campaigns you need to factor in 
&ldquo;localized keywords&rdquo; and really analyze the best words that people 
are searching, and come up with a list of keywords you will target. You can 
reach more people with an IP-targeted campaign then you can going after general 
words.</p> 
<p>Example:</p> 
<p>A great keyword to go after for a local mattress company (if you live in 
Salt Lake City) is &ldquo;Sandy Mattress&rdquo; or &ldquo;Salt Lake City 
Mattress Company&rdquo; If you are targeting the right areas with your 
campaigns anyone in these areas when these words are typed in will find you. 
You can also include area codes in your website and back end meta information 
as well as the local PPC campaigns.</p> 
<p>Yahoo should be your choice for truly local businesses (even if you 
don&rsquo;t have a website) wanting to target people near-by, and looking for 
phone calls and in-store traffic. Google will work better for you locally if 
you own a website and really want to try to target people by IP-addresses for 
really targeted local keywords.</p>
