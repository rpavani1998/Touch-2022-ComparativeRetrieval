<h2> What is a SERP (Search Engine Results Page)?</h2> 
<h2> &nbsp;</h2> 
<p> </p>  If you&rsquo;re interested in making money online, it&rsquo;s 
absolutely crucial that you understand the importance of a SERP. Also known as 
a search engine results page, a SERP is the webpage a search engine such as 
Google generates when a user searches for a particular term. It features the 
titles of webpages that match the keyword query, links to those pages, and a 
brief description of the content on each page.<br>
<br>
<strong>A SERP 
typically contains three types of listings:</strong> 
<ol> 
<li> Results automatically generated by a search engine spider,</li> 
<li> Results added by a human moderator,</li> 
<li> Paid listings that are often ads for a particular product or service.</li>
</ol> <br>
 Listings that have been added by the search engine&rsquo;s spider 
are often called organic search engine results or natural search engine 
results. Search engine spiders are programs that surf the web and automatically 
index pages according to a predefined set of criteria. To help their pages 
reach the top of these organic search results, companies oftenhire writers and 
consultants experienced in search engine optimization techniques. Although this 
strategy can be more expensive than simply buying a paid listing in the SERP, 
the investment is often seen as a vital component of building a successful 
business online.<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;  Although search engine spiders are a highly 
effective way to index web content, this system has the potential for abuse. 
Unethical website operators have been known to create sites that provide no 
useful content and exist solely to generate advertising revenue on a SERP. For 
this reason, listings that have been added into the search engine&rsquo;s 
directory by a human moderator or editor are preferred by many Internet users 
since these results are most likely to be relevant to a particular keyword 
query. Yahoo! is the best-known search engine that makes use of human 
moderators and editors when creating a SERP. <br>
 &nbsp;  Listings that a 
company has paid to have included in the SERP for a particular keyword query 
are often advertisements for a product or service. These paid advertisements 
are the primary way a commercial search engine is able to generate a profit. 
However, to help users make better decisions about what results are most 
relevant to their search, paid listings are separated from other listings. In 
Google, for example, the paid listings on a SERP are displayed in a sidebar on 
the right hand column of the page. In Yahoo!, these listings are known as a 
Yahoo! Sponsored Search and displayed at the top and bottom of the page in a 
blue box.<br>

<h4> Hits, visitors, visits, page views: what are the differences? </h4> 
<p> </p>  &nbsp;  Technical definition of a hit: each file sent to a browser 
by a web server is an individual hit. Technical definition of a page view: a 
pageview is each time a visitor views a page on your website, regardless of how 
many hits are generated.  &nbsp;  Pages are comprised of files. Every image in 
a page is a separate file. When a visitor looks at a page (a pageview), they 
may see numerous images, graphics, pictures etc. and generate multiple hits...
