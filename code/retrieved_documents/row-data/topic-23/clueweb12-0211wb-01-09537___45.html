<h3> Judging The American Wine Blog Awards </h3>  | <br>

<p>After Tom Wark announced the finalists for the American Wine Blog Awards, 
there was a lot of grumbling about who made the cut and who didn&rsquo;t. This 
is inevitable; I judge the relevance of any award by the amount of controversy 
it causes. Few people care that they didn&rsquo;t get an award they 
didn&rsquo;t know about. But as bloggers and their readers grouse, I thought 
I&rsquo;d offer my perspective as a judge.</p> 
<p>The judging process was straightforward: Anyone could nominate a blog in 
any of the categories, and when nominations closed, Tom sent each of the judges 
a spreadsheet with all the nominees. As far as I know, every nominated blog was 
on the spreadsheet, except for the ones written by the judges and the ones that 
didn&rsquo;t meet Tom&rsquo;s eligibility requirements. Each ofthe six judges 
ranked five finalists in each category, and then Tom combined all those to come 
up with the top four finalists he presented to readers.</p> 
<p>My Judging<br>
 Judges could use any criteria we wanted for deciding our 
top five. I gave 50 points for the &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; factor, which varied 
based on the category. For the Single Subject category, for instance, my 
&ldquo;so what?&rdquo; translated into a simple question: If I wanted to learn 
about your subject, would your blog be a good way to do it? Then I gave 40 
points for writing ability: Can the blogger communicate in a logical way? Does 
s/he demonstrate good knowledge rather than knee-jerk, poorly considered 
opinions? Finally, I gave 10 points for mechanics: Does the blogger know that
<em>it&rsquo;s</em> and <em>its</em> are separate words? Does s/he drop words 
from sentences? I gave this little weight in the total because most blogs 
don&rsquo;t have copy editors. (For the graphics awards, I just gave a single 
score.)</p> 
<p>I read the front page of entries for each site, and then all the posts from 
last September &mdash; sometimes people beef up their posts at awards time. I 
took notes on each blog. Brutal notes, too: I summed up one site with 
&ldquo;blah blah blah&rdquo; and another with &ldquo;who nominated this 
site?&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t matter if the site&rsquo;s author was a real-life 
friend, a social-networking &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; or a total stranger. I tried 
to be as objective as one can be in a subjective context.</p> 
<p>Is This The Best We Can Do?<br>
 Tom wrote of the finalists, &ldquo;The 
collection of finalists &hellip; is a stellar example of all the things that 
are outstanding about the wine blogosphere.&rdquo; As someone who pored through 
all the nominees, I had the opposite view: Is this the best we can do? There 
were one or two categories where I wished I could submit just three finalists, 
not five. In my scheme, not one site scored above 90 points (though there was 
at least one 89).</p> 
<p>I am guilty of many of the sins I noticed on other blogs. I&rsquo;m not 
sure how I would grade OWF if I were looking at it through the objective lens I 
turned on the WBA nominees. So I used my Web-wide jaunt as a reminder about 
what I could do to improve this site.</p> 
<p>Some of you may find these little discoveries interesting. Some of you may 
tell me to take a hike (or, you know, some other phrase). That&rsquo;s fine, 
because I want to preface these comments with one bit of advice:<strong>Write 
your blog for yourself</strong>. Writing for rewards and recognition is a 
sucker&rsquo;s game. I have felt the sting of being overlooked for awards, but 
I finally remembered that I write OWF for my own benefit; my readers seem to 
keep coming back, so who cares if I don&rsquo;t have a little badge in my 
sidebar?</p> 
<p>What I Learned From The AWBA Nominees<br>
 Context matters. If I want to 
read page after page of &quot;berries-cherries-flowers&quot; tasting notes and 
irrelevant scores, I&rsquo;ll pick up one of the big wine magazines. If I want 
to read uneducated, fawning press about some new health effect of wine, 
I&rsquo;ll turn to newspapers. As bloggers, we can tell our readers why a given 
wine matters (or doesn&rsquo;t) and where it fits in the world. We have the 
ability to talk about how it moves us (or doesn&rsquo;t). We can wrap news 
stories in our own opinions and research. We can take a reader farther than the 
magazines can. We can teach and inform.</p> 
<p>Personality matters. As bloggers, we don&rsquo;t have to adhere to a dry, 
third-person editorial voice. We can be ourselves. We can use the first-person 
perspective that few feature wells allow. Of course, too much personality can 
grate on the reader, but too much is better than none at all. When I read a 
blog post, I want to get a sense of the person who wrote it. I want to care 
enough to click on the &ldquo;About&rdquo; link at the top of your page. We 
should let ourselves shine through a bit more.</p> 
<p>Writing matters. I&rsquo;m not a prescriptivist about grammar, despite what 
you may think. But you don&rsquo;t need to memorize Strunk &amp; White to 
communicate ideas in a useful way. Writing is a craft before it&rsquo;s an art, 
and almost anyone can learn the craft. Magazines and newspapers have 
hard-working editors who clean up a writer&rsquo;s prose: We have to rely on 
ourselves. I gave some advice about thisin an earlier post &mdash; and I would 
add<em>A Writer&rsquo;s Coach</em> to my list of recommended books &mdash; but 
I think many blogs would benefit from a few hours between writing and posting 
and one last careful read before the author hits Publish.</p> 
<p>We have the opportunity to transform the way people look at wine. Our 
readers bond with us, learn about our lives, and trust our recommendations in 
ways most wine writers can&rsquo;t imagine. We can introduce our readers to 
something beyond the mass-market bottles and the everyday grapes. We can show 
them that high quality doesn&rsquo;t only come from a big magazine.</p>

<h3> American Wine Blog Awards </h3>  | <br>

<p>Last year, Tom Wark at Fermentation hosted the American Wine Blog Awards, 
and they proved popular enough to do a second time. If you read wine blogs 
&mdash; I consider OWF a food and wine blog, which means it doesn&rsquo;t quite 
fit in either category &mdash; you should go to his site and nominate some of 
your favorites. Nominations close on February 27, so you have time to think 
about it. Right now he&rsquo;s only taking nominations, so if a wine blog is 
mentioned you don&rsquo;t need to nominate it again. You&rsquo;ll get a chance 
to vote on the finalists in a few weeks.</p>

<h3> What Is Bimbo Break? </h3>  | <br>

<p>I was trying to solve a puzzle in the latest issue of <em>The Enigma</em>, 
the monthly publication ofThe National Puzzlers&rsquo; League, and I decided 
the answer might be one of the Coca-Cola brands. I haven&rsquo;t memorized 
them, of course, so I looked them up. Holy cats!They own everything. This 
isn&rsquo;t a surprise &mdash; America&rsquo;s favorite soft drink company is a 
sprawling mass of a corporation &mdash; but the list<em>en masse</em> is quite 
a sight.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s one to ponder: What is Bimbo Break? It&rsquo;s listed in their 
brands, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it. Maybe I just don&rsquo;t shop in the 
right stores. Or maybe, you know, Coca-Cola decided that that brand isn&rsquo;t 
quite ready for market yet.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what Bimbo Break isn&rsquo;t: the answer to the puzzle. 
I did manage to figure it out, though.</p>

<h3> Serendipity: A Bit Of Esoteric Wine History </h3>  | <br>

<p>I was searching the Government Printing Office&rsquo;s site while 
researching an article, and I stumbled across the record forthis 1986 document 
titled &ldquo;Imported wines : identifying and removing wines contaminated with 
diethylene glycol.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Sadly, the document&rsquo;s not available online: Maybe I&rsquo;ll look it 
up the next time I&rsquo;m at the library. Because the reason why there&rsquo;s 
a 1986 report about diethylene glycol in wine is that the year before, the 
international press went ballistic upon learning that a few Austrian producers 
in the Thermenregion had been adding that chemical to their wine. At the time, 
Austria followed Germany&rsquo;s lead and made tankfuls of cloying wine. 
Diethylene glycol allowed wine makers to sweeten wine even when the grapes 
didn&rsquo;t have enough sugar. This might not be a problem, except that 
diethylene glycol is related to ethylene glycol, an ingredient in antifreeze. 
(Diethylene glycol is significantly less toxic.)</p> 
<p>When the additive was discovered, it obliterated the Austrian wine 
industry&rsquo;s international presence. No one would touch the wines for 
years. But that event shaped the modern-day industry: It wiped out the large 
producers who had relied on voluminous sales and cleared the way for small 
producers with integrity to enter the spotlight. It also reversed the trend 
toward sweeter wines: Today, Austria&rsquo;s non-dessert whites are bone-dry, 
in contrast to Germany&rsquo;s. The incident also spawned every joke about 
antifreeze in the wine, including the one in the first season of The Simpsons.

<p>A number of you have asked about the survey I ran a while back. I&rsquo;ll 
post the results soon. In the meantime, if you want a break from Thanksgiving 
prep, here are a few good links for your enjoyment.</p> 
<p>The eloquent Mark Morford, columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, 
wrestles with ethical eating in the face of yummy food. Avoiding all 
questionable food would be so much easier if so much of that food didn&rsquo;t 
taste so good.</p> 
<p>What does your Thanksgiving meal look like? Turkey on the table, cranberry 
sauce on the side? Wiredoffers a different view: through the lens of a 
microscope.</p> 
<p>Finally, Jason Haas, of premier Paso Robles winery Tablas Creek, gave me a 
heads-up abouta recent post in which he discusses how the TTB&rsquo;s decision 
to stop granting AVAs has impeded efforts to subdivide Paso based on soil and 
climate.</p>

<h3> Equator Coffee Responds </h3>  | <br>

<p>A few days ago, I posted about The Shot&rsquo;s assertion that The French 
Laundry was using mediocre, expensive coffee in lieu of making a good cup.</p> 
<p>Brooke McDonnell, the owner and master roaster for Equator Coffee, saw my 
post and commented in defense of her company. I know not everyone reads the 
comments, so I thought I should post her statement, unedited except for HTML 
friendliness, here for you all to read. As I said before, I don&rsquo;t know 
anything about coffee, but I&rsquo;m willing to let people defend themselves 
and correct misimpressions.</p> 
<p>Brooke&rsquo;s comment: </p> 
<blockquote> In response to the espresso critic quoted in this blog, a bit of 
clarification:<br>
 1. Equator coffees &amp; teas does not supply, nor has it 
ever supplied, the espresso for the French Laundry which comes from Illy. (We 
supply their drip coffee). As a roaster I appreciate anyone who takes an 
interest in and promotes the crafting of specialty coffee in all its forms, 
yet, it is startling to read a review disparaging of Equator in the context of 
French Laundry espresso for the second time from the same critic.<br>
 2. As 
traditionalists we may have objections to the automatic espresso machines, 
however, in certain environments, where there are multiple servers, these 
machines eliminate inconsistencies and improve the execution.<br>
 3. Espresso 
preferences are subjective: Illy is just one style of espresso that when pulled 
properly has a strong constituency based on its balanced sweetness and moderate 
acidity. At recent barista competitions the trend was towards very tangy, 
citrusy, salty origin espresso. This is a big tent subject that leaves plenty 
of room to promote ones preference and appreciate other styles of espresso.<br>

 4. As any roaster knows, the key is always control over the variables that 
effect espresso, and, as any roaster knows, the same espresso can yield 
different results at different locations under different hands. The espresso 
critic's ratings confirm this. Even when there has been on-site training (which 
we do), the roaster has limited influence over the final espresso translation. 
Simply put, we cannot compel those on the front lines of retail to have a 
passion for the process.<br>
 5. Regarding the Panama Geisha served at the 
French Laundry: after visiting the Esmeralda farm, I arranged for one of owners 
to meet the French Laundry staff and provide background on the coffee varietal 
and microclimate prior to introducing this coffee. The staff took the time to 
educate themselves on the agronomy of this coffee farm. They also spent time 
evaluating different roast styles and brewing methods. I was impressed with 
their commitment to raise the bar on their brewed coffee program.<br>

<h3> Wine Gadgets The World Needs </h3>  | <br>

<p>Lore Sj&ouml;berg, who often writes humorous pieces for Wired, has put his 
satirical pen to paper and ponderedthe wine gadgets missing from the world. An 
automatic wine twirler? A tooth-mounted flavor sensor? A temporal acceleration 
device to age your wine? (He&rsquo;s obviously unaware of the devices that 
purport to do this.)</p> 
<p>How about his idea for a first-person Champagne shooter? I could combine my 
love of video games with my love of wine, though I&rsquo;m not a big FPS fan.
</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but point out that his use of the word 
&ldquo;varietal&rdquo; &mdash; to my mind, a misuse &mdash; illustratesmy 
belief that we shouldn&rsquo;t use the word except in its very specific meaning 
of a bottle marketed as being made from a single grape variety. Why use jargon 
incorrectly when there&rsquo;s a perfectly good non-jargon term? That&rsquo;s 
part of why culture views wine geeks as objects of derision.</p>

<h3> The French Laundry's Mediocre Coffee? </h3>  | <br>

<p>I know nothing about coffee except that I don&rsquo;t like it. But my friend
Tim does: He owns a popular coffeehouse in San Leandro that does its own 
roasting and blending. He forwardedan amusing post arguing that The French 
Laundry is trying to cover for mediocre coffee by impressing guests with its 
price. Or as the author writes:</p> 
<blockquote> Yes, the man behind America&rsquo;s most esteemed of restaurants 
&hellip; has proudly announced to his customers that they[<em>sic</em>] will 
now offer Panama Esmeralda Geisha coffee roasted by the consistently 
underwhelming Equator Estate Coffees. &hellip; rather than get educated, train 
staff, and elevate the craft (if not also chuck their superautomatic Schaerer 
espresso machine for something less suited for an assembly line), they take the 
lazy short cut of espousing the merits of &ldquo;the most expensive coffee in 
the world&rdquo; on their menus</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Any thoughts on this from you all? (Other than the misuse of the word 
&ldquo;compliment&rdquo; in the original press release?)</p>

<p>Tom Wark, whose wine blog Fermentations is a popular destination, has

about American legislation that prevents a retailer in one state from shipping 
to a customer in another. Those laws give the consumer fewer choices and the 
retailer less opportunity to make money.</p>

<h3> Batali's Blog </h3>  | <br>

vented about one non-fact that he wanted to clarify, changing a potentially

<p>But Regina at Gastropoda posted a note that Batali has started to blog at 
Serious Eats. I&rsquo;m tempted to launch &ldquo;snarky vituperatives from 
behind the smoky curtain of the web,&rdquo; which is what his article suggested 
we all do, but I guess if he&rsquo;s a food blogger now, he can do that 
himself. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll show us veterans how it&rsquo;s done, 
assuming he can sustain his blog for long enough.</p> 
<p>(Note: Sorry for those who clicked on the earlier link only to find that it 
was an old, old blog. It just goes to show that when you snark about someone 
else&rsquo;s misinformation, you always end up making a mistake yourself.)</p>

time-consuming stovetop clarification. You add a little gelatin to the liquid, 
freeze it, and then thaw it in the refrigerator. The gelatin becomes a 
molecular sieve, and the melting water washes small flavor compounds through 
the net while the gelatin traps fat and other impurities.There&rsquo;s even a 
recipe for brown butter consomme to get you started. You can do it with a wide 
range of liquids, and you don&rsquo;t need any equipment besides a refrigerator 
and a freezer. I&rsquo;ll be trying this as soon as I get a moment.</p>

<h3> Not About Food: BlogDay 2007 </h3>  | <br>

<p><em>Take the OWF 5-year anniversary reader survey.</em></p> 
<p>Today is BlogDay, an annual event where bloggers point the way to five 
&ldquo;new&rdquo; blogs. I interpret that phrase to mean &ldquo;new, perhaps, 
to you&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;less than one year old.&rdquo; So I looked in 
my RSS reader for blogs you might like. (Of course I call out specific sites 
throughout the year as well).</p> 
<p>Comics Curmudgeon - Nothing gets me giggling like Josh's sarcastic rundown 
of the morning comics page. (I&rsquo;m less fond of his occasional guest 
blogger UncleLumpy.) Who knew there was so much humor in Mary Worth, Mark 
Trail, and Family Circus?</p> 
<p>Terroir at Wine Library - I have a love affair with off-the-map grapes, and 
so does Tom, who uses his blog to write about oddball varieties and the wines 
they produce. He gives out lots of information and writes with a distinct voice.
</p> 
<p>The Wine Importer - Joe Dressner &mdash; like Terry Theise, Kermit Lynch, 
and Jorge Ordonas &mdash; is one of those wine importers whose name on a bottle 
is sufficient reason to buy it. He champions biodynamic wines here in the U.S., 
and his sporadically updated blog injects humor into the 
so-often-self-important wine industry.</p> 
<p>Lexicographer's Rules - Grant Barrett is the co-host of A Way With Words, 
and his personal blog lights up the cave of language and dictionaries.</p> 
<p>Violent Acres - She's often blunt; she's often caustic. She often paints in 
broad strokes of black and white. But she's also funny, introspective, and 
thought-provoking. If you don't like strong language, or if you love the mommy 
bloggers she so often attacks, stay clear of this site.</p>

<h3> Crappyjack </h3>  | <br>

<p>While listening to a podcast from the New Word Open Mic event at the 
Dictionary Society of North America meeting, I heard the neologism <em>
crappyjack</em> as a synonym for junk food. Anything you snack on that leaves 
you with a hollow feeling could be crappyjack, which comes from<em>crap</em> 
plus Cracker Jack (an American snack food of peanuts and caramel-coated 
popcorn, for those outside of its reach).</p> 
<p>This seems like a fine word to use for the low-nutrition, high-calorie junk 
food that transports high-fructose corn syrup to our bodies, so I post it here 
for all of you to spread to the masses.</p>

</p> 
<blockquote> Because if Bon App&eacute;tit is the food media's Newsweek and 
Saveur is the Economist, then the Art of Eating is the New York Review of 
Books: sometimes impenetrable, often spellbinding, and never, ever reductive.
</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>I had to laugh at this quote: &quot;A reader not long ago wrote to me 
saying: 'You are the guy who had the courage to say all coffee in North America 
is over-roasted,' and I probably did say something nearly like that.&quot; I 
saw that letter, because the rest of it fumed about letting me write about 
Vinovation.</p> 
<p> Go and read what Ed, one of our country's best food writers, has to say 
about the culinary world. Go and read what one of my role models says about his 
influences.</p>

listen to short pieces about organic, local, and ethical food while you walk to 
work.Click here for the iTunes link.</p> 
<p>Skip Lombardi wrote to me about his Food Stamp Challenge, in which he and 
his significant other are trying to live on Food Stamp amounts. He distances 
himself from the politicians who have done this recently, saying, &quot;most of 
the participants we've read about made little or no attempt to actually cook! 
They simply went to grocery stores and bought foods that seemed cheap.&quot; 
The two of them, on the other hand, are passionate cooks. They want to 
stimulate discussion about the benefits of cooking and make constructive 
suggestions to diners on Food Stamp budgets. Pool resources, they suggest, 
among other things.</p> 
<p>I had never read Peter Barrett's cookblog until he wrote me a couple months 
ago, but I feel like I've found a kindred spirit on the other side of the 
country. He salt cures his own meat, experiments with sous vide cooking, and 
loves good wine.</p>

<h3> Terry's Latest Catalogs </h3>  | <br>

<p>Thanks to a post on Eric's blog, I see that Terry Theise has released his 
latest catalogs. As Eric notes, Terry writes with eloquence and passion about 
Germany, Austria, Champagne, and the larger world of wine. He drips fantastic 
quotes: You can't keep up with the shimmering pearls of wisdom that cascade off 
of him. I work hard for even the tiny glints of color in my text; Terry writes 
in rainbows as if it's the most natural thing to do.</p> 
<p>I suppose I should mention that I have a bit part in Terry's Germany 
catalog this year. He and I had a friendly email exchange about my Vinovation 
piece&mdash;we get along well&mdash;and he reproduced snippets in the text. 
Terry and I agree about what makes good wine, but I am more accepting of 
Vinovation's role within the context of modern wine making. (I went to a recent 
tasting of his, and he said upon spying me, &quot;Derrick, I was so hoping you 
would come.&quot; A perfectly timed pause, and then, &quot;So you can remind 
yourself what real wine tastes like.&quot;)</p>

<h3> Self-Tending BBQ </h3>  | <br>

<p>Tired of tending your barbecue for hours and hours and hours? Maybe you 
should build a self-tending model like theone that Nathan Moore submitted to 
the Popular Mechanics do-it-yourself rally. It doesn't look too difficult, 
given the interview and the drawing. If I ever upgrade to a wood-fired smoker, 
I'm tempted to build one of these. Or recruit a friend who knows something 
about mechanics.</p> 
<p>As a side note, look at how Moore refers to <em>barbecue</em> as a synonym 
for slow cooking. Not fast cooking on a grill: That's called grilling. 
Grilling. Barbecue. Grilling. Barbecue. (Pilotless Drone.) These are two vastly 
different cooking styles. It's not a barbecue when there's a grill; it's a 
cookout. (My co-workers once changed the name of our company's 
&quot;barbecue&quot; to cookout, just to avoid hearing me rant about this 
topic. I call that a victory.)</p>

<h3> In Search Of Real Food? Skip Yahoo </h3>  | <br>

<p>The other day, I got a press release that serves as a case study in trying 
to trick potential customers. Hellmann's (or Best Foods for those on this side 
of the country) has partnered with Yahoo! Food in a campaign they callThe 
Search For Real Food.</p> 
<p>Hellmann's. Real Food. No, I just can't make the math work. I don't have a 
problem with Hellmann's as a food product&mdash;none apart from a general 
stance against flavorless, chemical-laden industrial foods, anyway&mdash;but is 
there any food less real than the preservative-laden spread? Just as 
megaproducers have co-opted the terms<em>organic</em> and <em>natural</em> and 
the bucolic imagery they conjure, Hellmann's has tied itself to a term that has 
traction among modern shoppers. Even if they don't approve or edit the 
content&mdash;and I assume they do&mdash;every visitor to that site will 
conflate Hellmann's and real food. At the very least, they'll believe that 
Hellmann's actually cares about it.</p> 
<p>The PR person who sent me the link mentioned that they'd be looking for 
good &quot;real food&quot; blog posts to highlight. Here's my recommendation:
how to make your own mayonnaise at cookingforengineers.com. Taste the real 
thing, and you'll wonder how anyone considers Hellmann's to be mayonnaise. The 
real sauce is a snap to make, especially if you use a food processor. It only 
keeps for a week in the refrigerator, instead of the months and months that 
Hellmann's will hold up, but which expiration date sounds more like real food?

<h3> The Subjectiveness of Smell </h3>  | <br>

<p>Slate's Mike Steinberger continues his look at the physiology of tasting 
wine witha probing of the nose. There's some good information there, and it 
reinforces what I already tell my students: You are always right about what you 
smell and what you like.</p> 
<p>Steinberger, quoting a researcher, mentions the classic &quot;white 
wine&quot; vs. &quot;red wine&quot; experiment in which a white wine with red 
dye results in red wine descriptions. He also alludes to the &quot;label&quot; 
experiment mentioned in<em>Mindless Eating</em>, in which the same wine with a 
Napa label gets more praise than when it sports a Montana label, though in this 
case he mentions &quot;vin de table&quot; versus &quot;grand cru&quot; as the 
variables. It makes you wonder about the lack of bias in those wine critics who 
claim to taste wines blind but in fact know the grape and region before they 
sip.</p>

<h3> Brilliant McDonald's PR </h3>  | <br>

<p>According to the Chicago Tribune, McDonald's will allow six moms to 
investigate restaurants in the chain, work in the restaurant, and then blog 
about their experiences and their discoveries.</p> 
<p>Who are these moms? I'll bet McDonald's didn't choose top-notch 
investigative journalists. While pundits quoted in the article say the move 
could backfire, I think McDonald's has come up with a brilliant idea. Let these 
women ask &quot;pointed&quot; questions, and then spin them a comfortable 
answer that they'll post for all their readers to see.</p> 
<p>McDonald's will give them tours of the hamburger plant and apple orchards. 
How very open and transparent of them. I didn't see anything in the article 
about tours of pork farms for the bacon, slaughterhouses, or shantytowns where 
slaughterhouse workers live. Will they get to sit in on the meetings where the 
attendees discuss ways to make advertisements that get children into the 
restaurant? Will they get to look at the company's financials? And do you think 
McDonald's will let these women visit the plants and apple farms unannounced?
</p> 
<p>When I started to blog, and even when I started to write professionally, I 
found it hard to resist marketing spin. There's a reason none of my clients 
consider a P.R. person or a marketing rep a valid source. &quot;Your wine won a 
gold medal? That's great!&quot; &quot;Oh! Alcohol levels don't matter because 
you balance the wine? Interesting.&quot; &quot;You make your wine in the 
vineyard? That sounds reasonable.&quot; Everyone seems so sincere. Several 
years into this, I'll nod politely and groan inside when I decide not to call 
them on this pap: If it's not relevant to my article, I don't care what lies 
they want to tell me, but if it's part of the piece I know enough to ask 
pointed questions. (Some of my favorites: &quot;So you weren't making balanced 
wines with low alcohol? Oh, you were? So why up the alcohol?&quot; &quot;Do you 
think they go well with food?&quot; &quot;If you make wine in the vineyard, why 
don't you use natural yeast?&quot;)</p> 
<p>Will the McMoms fall prey to this spin? Maybe not. But six moms with 
who-knows-what backgrounds against a corporate giant with a well-funded and 
adept marketing group? My money's on the Golden Arches.</p>

<h3> Where Does Wine Lingo Come From? </h3>  | <br>

<p>Mike Steinberger has an interesting piece at Slate about how the modern

about. I have struggled to make my tasting notes readable, both here and in 
print, but I grew up in the &quot;list all the aromas&quot; school, and that's 
a tough habit to break. The old-school masculine/feminine language isn't any 
better, as it lacks the ability to communicate with anyone except wine geeks. 
This is a common subject at the Wine Writers' Symposium, where Karen MacNeil 
pushes us to write interesting tasting notes.</p>

<h3> The New York Times On Dinner Parties </h3>  | <br>

<p>The New York Times has a close-to-home article about foodie dinner parties. 
Modern hosts worry about serving the best food, finding the most local 
ingredients, using the best china, hand making everything, receiving judgment 
about their food, and so forth. (I love the line, &quot;his and her 
subscriptions toThe Art of Eating;&quot; I imagine Ed will also laugh to see 
his quarterly love letter to the traditional food of the world&mdash;often the 
product of rural frugality&mdash;cast as a must-have bourgeois accessory, 
though the demographic is probably accurate.)</p> 
<p>Too bad the author could only find hosts who care more about the impression 
they make than the joy of friendship; these people sound dreary. Our dinner 
parties sit far to the right on the bell curve, but I don't cook the way I do 
to impress people: I cook the way I do because I enjoy it, and I want to do 
something special for our friends. I get to try out dishes I probably wouldn't 
do for Melissa and me. I buy special ingredients or hand make them because they 
taste better, not because I want to pass muster with my guests. We like 
chatting with our friends over good food and wine, and where better to do so 
than the comfort of our own home?</p> 
<p>I stress about dinner parties, but only because I want the food to taste 
good, not because I'm worried that my friends will think less of me if 
something isn't perfect. I could probably name a dozen things I wasn't happy 
about forClotilde's dinner party&mdash;from subtle flavor quibbles to 
components that never made it out of the kitchen&mdash;but I don't imagine that 
any of the guests went home thinking, &quot;Well, too bad that didn't work 
out.&quot; Of course,as I've said before, the real secret is to not tell your 
dinner guests what went wrong. If you're not going to fess up, why stress?</p> 
<p>Is the article sketching a difference between New Yorkers and Bay Areans? 
Or just me and other foodies? How do you feel when you host a dinner party? Are 
you out to impress? I'd love to hear what you think of the article.</p> 
<p>One last thing: I agreed with the idea that foodies who throw fancy dinner 
parties don't get many invitations in return. Our friends are often intimidated 
to have us over. But, really, you could order Domino's and beer and we'd be 
happy guests; the point is to hang out and enjoy each other's company.</p>

<h3> Clark Smith on Sweet Spots and Food </h3>  | <br>

<p>After my Vinovation piece came out in The Art of Eating, the magazine 
received a small flood of letters, some of which are published in the current 
issue. One of those came from Mark Anisman, who asked how a wine's sweet spot 
did or did not change in the presence of food. A wine's sweet spot is the 
alcohol level at which it tastes the most balanced; for any given wine, there 
may be 3 or 4 such spots, scattered about the field of possibilities.</p> 
<p>Anisman argues that Vinovation works in a vacuum where food is not 
considered, even though most people drink wine with food. I agree that this is 
a failing of wine criticism, but I do wonder how much cellar work&mdash;which 
is how I would label sweet spot evaluation&mdash;is done with food in hand.</p> 
<p>Anisman left a similar comment here, and I posed the question to Clark. He

Coca-Cola's Chief Creative Officer Esther Lee, says inthis article at AdAge, 
&quot;Our Achilles heel is the discussion about obesity.&quot; So you can 
imagine their concern at the news that the FTC will conduct a widespread probe 
into advertising aimed at children and the healthfulness of those products.</p> 
<p>From the article: </p> 
<blockquote> And it's getting even bigger as the Federal Trade Commission 
takes the extreme step of issuing compulsory requests for information from 44 
food, beverage and quick-service restaurant chains this summer. The goal is to 
get a &quot;more complete picture&quot; of their kid-marketing practices, 
especially in the unplumbed arenas of in-store promotions, events, packaging, 
internet marketing and product placement in video games, movies and TV programs.

<h3> Bees And Cell Phones </h3>  | <br>

<p>A decade or more ago, I bought a book called <em>Why Things Bite Back</em>, 
and one of its key points was that technology solves old problems but creates 
new ones. Call it the Law of Conservation of Anxiety.</p> 
<p>I thought of that book when I read today's news that some scientists 
believe that cell phone usage has created Colony Collapse Disorder. CCD is a 
catastrophe breaking over world agriculture like a tsunami. Bee colonies have 
been shutting down left and right in unprecedented numbers for no good reason. 
Why is this a problem? Because a wide range of farmers rely on bees to 
pollinate their crops. No bees, no crops, no food.</p> 
<p>But I have to wonder about this theory, which arises from the fact that 
bees won't return to the hive when someone's using a cell phone in their 
vicinity. Why this year? Shouldn't we have seen a gradual decline in bee 
colonies inversely proportional to increased cell phone usage? And how would it 
spread to Europe from the U.S., given that Europe has deeper cell phone 
penetration than this country? Or is there a tipping point at work here? Or is 
it not just cell phones, but the increasingly ubiquitous wifi networks?</p> 
<p>Scientists around the world are scrambling to find an explanation for CCD, 
so you can expect to hear any number of theories in the coming months. Fingers 
have already pointed to global warming; as with the cell phone theory, no 
experiments have shown conclusive connections.</p> 
<p>And if cell phones are the problem, how do we fix that? Tell everyone to 
stop using them? Or require users to only call from a shielded place, such as a 
car?</p>

<h3> Where Did The Feast Move From? </h3>  | <br>

<p>A fellow National Puzzlers' League member posed a question to the mailing 
list: Where does<em>movable feast</em> come from? The answer isn't &quot;the 
title of a Hemingway novel.&quot; A flurry of word geeks chimed in, and I guess 
it's no surprise that Wikipediagives the full scoop. Christian holidays tied to 
a particular date, such as a saint's day or Christmas, are immovable feasts. 
Christian holidays that can shift around the calendar, such as Easter, are 
movable feasts. Now you know.</p> 
<p>Speaking of movable feasts, the rules for calculating Easter's date for any 
given year are deliciously complicated andworth a look. &Uuml;ber-mathematician 
John Conway published the algorithm, an adjunct to his system for determining 
the day of week of any given date, in the second volume of the original<em>
Winning Ways</em> series. I don't have the new versions handy as I write this, 
but I'd guess it's now in<em>Winning Ways Volume 4</em>.</p>

<h3> Whole Foods Advertises Violation of Its Own Rules? </h3>  | <br>

<p>Many of you know that I'm always happy to bash Whole Foods. I disapprove of 
its anti-union philosophy, its phony &quot;we love local food&quot; stance, and 
its bullying of Grimaud Farms.</p> 
<p>So you can imagine how happy I was when Erik Sherman sent me a link to his 
post about dyed salmon in Whole Foods. He noticed a tag informing the consumer 
that the fish was dyed, which is a good practice, but then he wondered how this 
fits into the company's stated policy to avoid all foods with artificial 
colorings and flavorings. Of course, the dye is probably a &quot;natural&quot; 
dye in the way that soda has &quot;natural&quot; flavors, but I'd argue that 
dyed fish goes against the spirit of the company's marketing message, if not 
the letter. The PR representatives haven't responded to his emailed queries 
yet, says Erik.</p> 
<p>Update: Erik received a response from Whole Foods and dissects it on his 
site.</p>

like, &quot;Keep it coming, Robespierre,&quot; or, &quot;Don't forget that I

<h3> Around The Web </h3>  | <br>

<p>Melissa and I were away for the long weekend, and we find ourselves 
catching up with a few interesting pieces.</p> 
<p>Dan Barber wrote an in-depth op-ed piece for the New York Times that 
articulates many of the problems with our current agricultural system. 
Unfortunately, he uses taste as the lead-in to his many useful points. A cry 
for flavor smacks of food snobbery to many, even if he's right that small farms 
and local distribution networks make for better-tasting ingredients. Most 
people in the country don't know or don't remember that non-industrial food 
tastes better. When factories have placed uninteresting eggs into every store 
in the country, who knows about small-farm eggs? Food snobs and those lucky 
enough to live in an area where they can buy that level of food.</p> 
<p>Food and Wine magazine offers advice on cooking locally, if you live in 
California or Vermont. I don't envy a national magazine that has to cover local 
eating, since by definition readers' options will be different in different 
parts of the country. Still, it's always nice to see the topic brought to 
national attention, and the article does offer some insights for the locavore 
in winter.</p> 
<p>Chow provides a primer on the cutting-edge science used in famous kitchens. 
The writer even knows to warn you away from the term &quot;molecular 
gastronomy.&quot;</p>

<h3> Positive Study Results? Check the Funder. </h3>  | <br>

<p>HealthDay has an article about a study of studies. When beverage companies 
fund a study, the results are more likely to come down in the beverage's favor.
</p> 
<p>Shocking, I know. But it's worth remembering when you see scientific 
studies trumpeting the health benefits of your favorite beverage.</p> 
<p>In 1993, Stephen Jay Gould wrote an essay entitled &quot;Cordelia's 
Dilemma&quot; describing the aversion to publishing negative results. Few 
scientists put forth a hypothesis and then publish results that don't support 
it. At best, they silently discard the results, ensuring that other scientists 
have to duplicate their work. At worst, they run the experiment until the 
results support the hypothesis, and then they publish those results. You don't 
see the 99 other trials that failed. It's easy to see how a corporate funder 
could create a &quot;Cordelia's Dilemma&quot; for a research team.</p>

<h3> Foie Gras Without Force-Feeding? </h3>  | <br>

<p>In a post at The Ethicurean, I noticed a link to an article describing a 
Spanish foie gras that received the Coup de Coeur award for innovation at the 
Paris International Food Salon.</p> 
<p>The surprise here isn't the country of origin: Spain, like Belgium, 
produces a small amount of foie gras. Look instead to the farmer's technique.
</p> 
<p>The producer claims he made the foie gras without force-feeding the birds, 
relying on their tendency to bulk up for migration. If he's got the real thing, 
he would be the savior of the foie gras industry. Animal activists focus on the 
force-feeding; take it away, and their argument disappears.Of course I felt the 
urge to comment.</p> 
<p>It's always been possible to produce high-fat livers without force-feeding 
the birds through gavage (using a tube to feed the birds, a practice that dates 
back to Roman times). But consumers have never accepted the product as foie 
gras. Well, not for a couple hundred years. I note that the article doesn't 
mention how the innovate foie gras tastes next to traditional foie gras.</p> 
<p>Geese, which Pateria de Sousa uses, might adapt to &quot;free range 
foie&quot; more than ducks would. Geese sometimes eat more on their own than 
they get in a foie gras feeding, though they don't sustain that eating habit as 
long as gavage lasts.</p> 
<p>But geese cause headaches for foie gras producers. You can't artificially 
inseminate them, so a farmer can only sell fresh foie gras during the winter 
season, when Spring's goslings have come of age. And they stress more readily 
than ducks. When the stoic Mulard breed came on the scene in the 1970s, it 
transformed the industry overnight. Fifty years ago, 90 per cent of the birds 
for foie gras were geese. Today, only 20 per cent are.</p> 
<p>I'm skeptical of the Sousa product; if it were that simple to produce good 
foie gras without force-feeding, someone would have done it. As I say, 
non-force-fed foie gras is the Holy Grail, and everyone's looking for it. 
Still, if anyone has more information, I'd love to hear it.</p>

<h3> Engineering Mad Cow Out Of Cows </h3>  | <br>

illness didn't take hold in the engineered cows.</p> 
<p>The company that did the work isn't interested in cows destined for beef, 
and the results are still early, but how long do you think we'll have to wait 
until the government approves GMO cows as a solution to mad cow disease, itself 
a by-product of our industrialized agriculture and our demand for cheap meat? 
GMO will become the new irradiation, applying a Band-Aid to a problem instead 
of dodging the injury in the first place.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2> 
<h2>These Are a Few of My Favorite Links</h2> Food Blogs <br>

<ul> 
<li>Other Food 
<ul> 
<li>The Art of Eating - possibly the very best food magazine in the world. Ed 
Behr researches his articles heavily, asks hard questions, and gives his 
readers the inside scoop. I'm always excited when an issue shows up.</li> 
<li>eGullet - the collective knowledge of 20000 opinionated and knowledgeable 
food lovers.</li> 
<li>Heritage Foods USA - They're most famous for their heritage turkeys, but 
in fact this small company sells meat from all sorts of non-industrialized 
livestock. Plus other products that don't see a wider market.</li> 
<li>Jojo - one of our favorite Oakland restaurants. Country French food in a 
warm and comfortable space.</li> 
<li>The New York Times food section - Probably the most influential newspaper 
food section in the country. Some articles are aimed at New Yorkers 
specifically, but others are of more general interest.</li> 
<li>Opinionated About - This site requires registration, but offers another 
opinionated community of foodies, one focused on dining more than cooking.</li> 
<li>SF Chronicle's Food section - The award-winning food section from my local 
paper, certainly the most influential in the Bay Area.</li> 
<li>SF Chronicle's Wine section - As much as I like the Chron's food section, I
<i>really</i> like the wine section.</li> 
<li>Slow Food - the international movement devoted to traditional, flavorful 
food and agricultural biodiversity.</li> 
<li>Slow Food Forum - a forum for Slow Food advocates that includes both 
national topics as well as regional Slow Food items</li> 
<li>West Coast Wine - a discussion forum that focuses on, wait for it, West 
Coast Wine.</li> 
<li>The Wine News - I recently discovered this magazine, and even more 
recently started getting articles published in it. The articles provide good 
coverage of topics, and I love the fact that they tell readers to take their 
scores with a grain of salt, that they are not the results of some exact 
science, but the impressions of the person tasting the wines</li> 
<li>Wine Spectator - I don't necessarily think Wine Spectator is all that and 
then some, as many do, but their site does have a great selection of wine news, 
and their &quot;What Am I Tasting?&quot; quiz is always fun</li> 
<li>Zingerman's - here in the Bay Area, we're lucky. Lots of stores sell 
artisanal products. If we didn't live here, we'd mail-order everything from 
Zingerman's</li> 
<li>Zocalo Coffee House - My friend Tim shocked lots of people when he left 
his prestigious Apple job to run a coffee shop, but he's loving it and has 
built up quite a community.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Other 
<ul> 
<li>My wife Melissa's site. She's a jewelry maker and woodworker.</li> 
<li>An Obsession with Everything Else My other blog, with a focus on 
everything and nothing. Sporadically updated.</li> 
<li>Astronomy Picture of the Day - 'cause it's neat.</li> 
<li>Booksense - Forget the hegemony of chains or the soulless machines 
underlying Amazon.com. Independent bookstores are where it's at. Booksense is a 
network of independents that work to promote each other and books. 
Recommendations aren't there because the publisher paid enough; they're there 
because actual people liked the books.</li> 
<li>BuyBlue - Find out which companies gave money to the Democrats so you can 
support them.</li> 
<li>Chris Holmes Photography - Chris has a really nice eye for captivating, 
up-close photos. Seeing the interior of a flower or dewdrops on a leaf in so 
much detail is a good reminder of how much beauty is all around us.</li> 
<li>Cody's Blog - a sporadically updated blog run by the staff of my favorite 
independent bookstore. Book news and random thoughts.</li> 
<li>joe's nyc - A great eye for photographs seems to be a genetic trait of the 
Holmes children. Joe, brother to Tim and Chris, takes photos all around him in 
New York.</li> 
<li>Salon.com - Lots of great articles covering all sorts of topics.</li> 
<li>Slashdot - News for nerds.</li> 
<li>Slate - Similar to Salon in terms of coverage, but with a wider range of 
topics.</li> 
<li>Stuffola - Deborah is one of the sharpest folks I know. She's also been 
invaluable as a writing mentor, a debt I can probably never repay. Now she's 
turned her piercing eye to our need to acquire, well, stuff.</li> 
<li>Velerosa - My friend Hans bought the last Bear boat ever made (number 69 
of 69) and he started a blog about it</li> </ul></li> </ul> 
<p>Who am I? My name's Derrick Schneider and I'm just someone who's passionate 
(and correspondingly opinionated) about food and wine. I am a fanatical cook, 
and consider my cuisine to be heavily influenced by French, Italian, and 
American cuisines. I'm a freelance food and wine writer and computer 
programmer. Every now and then, I'm a ;a 
href=&quot;http://www.johnrausch.com/DesignCompetition/2002/results.htm&quot;&gt;puzzle 
designer. Other hobbies: I love reading above all other hobbies. I consider 
myself an opera buff. I enjoy quilting. I've been known to be absorbed by Buffy 
the Vampire Slayer (like, every time a new season comes out on DVD).</p>
