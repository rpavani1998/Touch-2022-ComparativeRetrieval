<p>Now that Google Chrome 11 has hit the beta channel, you can expect to see 
extension and Web app developers making use of the new HTML5 speech-to-text 
API. In fact, there's as least one slick extension you can already install:
Speechify.</p> 
<p>Install Speechify, and you'll see a microphone icon added into the search 
box on many popular sites -- like Google and Bing. Click it, and Speechify will 
convert the words you speak into text. You've still got to press enter or click 
to search, and an automatic submit option is definitely something we'd like to 
see added.</p>

<h2>Voice Search for Chrome extension lets you search by speaking</h2>

<p>Voice Search is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to speak 
search queries instead of typing them, and it's not limited to Google searches.
</p> 
<p>It works very similar to the voice input system that Google has built into 
Android. A microphone icon will show up in your browser's extensions area, as 
well as near any HTML5-powered search box on websites that it can be used for. 
To search for &quot;kittens&quot;, the developer says, just click on the 
microphone and say &quot;kittens&quot;. To search Google Images for kittens, 
say &quot;google images kittens&quot;. To search Wikipedia, say 
&quot;wikipedia&quot; followed by your query.</p> 
<p>Voice Search can search using the following sites by default: 
&#65279;Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Wolfram Alpha. 
However, you can also add other search engines that you like.</p> 
<p>This is at a very experimental stage at the moment, and as such you may 
find that you need to start Chrome with the flag<strong>--enable-voice-input
</strong> for the add-on to even work. Instructions on how to add the flag are 
available onthe app's page in the Chrome Web Store, which is also where you can 
download Voice Search for Chrome for free.</p>

<p>Most of the smartphones today have the ability to accept voice commands and 
perform actions. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could just speak something 
and get things done on your PC too?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Well, if you use Google Chrome, here is a great feature which will allow 
you to search several search engines by speaking. TheChrome extension called 
Voice Search is an experimental add-on which allows you to search Google or any 
other search engines by speaking out the words you want to search.</p> 
<p>This is a really amazing add-on and goes on to show the capabilities built 
into Google Chrome. I tested this feature out to demonstrate how this works, 
the video is a bit grainy due to bad lighting; will upload another one shortly. 
Of course, the extension is not perfect and does not recognize all the words, 
however, once fully developed it would become a really good way to type text 
without having to use the keyboard.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>(Click here if you can&rsquo;t see the video)</p> 
<p>Voice Search comes pre-loaded with the following default services: Google, 
Wikipedia, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Wolfram|Alpha. You can also add 
your own user-defined search engines. It also integrates a speech input button 
for all websites using HTML5 search boxes, all of the default search 
engines&rsquo; websites, Facebook, Twitter, reddit, and GitHub.</p> 
<p>Of course you require a microphone for this to work. Excited? Go ahead and 
download the Voice Search extension for Google Chrome now.</p>
