DISCUSSION -- // 
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; TOPIC: 
SEARCH AS A COMMODITY? From: SearchReturn Hello everyone, Search engines have 
been used as a commodity to power portal Web search in times past, and with the 
advent of Google, the move toward search as a standalone application has proven 
itself fully viable. In the article &quot;Search is a commodity (again),&quot; 
it is argued that search has reverted back to the status of commodity. 
http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/11/search_is_a_com.php If no single 
search service stands out like Google did to differentiate originally, this 
could certainly be a reality. If a search box in browser software, (or as a 
function of a favorite portal) ends up being the way people use search (rather 
than directly), that threatens the very nature of success Google has enjoyed to 
this point. The days when search is then a commodity, as Inktomi once was used, 
may return again. Not so fast. Nearly all of Google's revenue is earned by ads 
served at Google.com, where only a meager 10% (roughly) is earned through 
content network ad serving. Google lives and dies by the sheer number of users 
who visit Google.com and engage its search services, (Google gives the largest 
stake of advertising revenue to content publisher partners that serve its ads). 
Google personalization officially came out of beta today, now offered generally 
worldwide. The motive behind Google becoming a portal? Protecting its user 
marketshare. But here lies the rub: would you pay for Google news? If search 
becomes a commodity again, Google would be charging for services it currently 
gives away free, then an upstart can repeat the Google burn by focusing on 
search alone. Let's face it, Google generally sends users off to other websites 
rather than keeping visitors transfixed by its own services, and amazingly, 
this really does not harm its earning potential. Google can think of itself as 
a modern media company, referring users elsewhere while selling search ads. The 
only motive Google has to diversify its offerings is to protect it's user base; 
not to add revenue generating services. People speculate that Google Base, (or 
&quot;Automat&quot; which is another service name making the rounds), will be 
the next revenue stream for Google. But Google would face a &quot;sea 
change&quot; if it began charging money for such things. It is more Google's MO 
to give things away, like Google Earth. We bet many readers were ecstatic to 
learn that the basic version of Google Earth is free, and would gladly have 
paid something for it. That is viral marketing at its best. In a leaked memo, 
(which may have been leaked intentionally), even Bill Gates is betting that 
Internet-centric service offerings being successful as offered free, 
advertising supported. Cringely speculates that to compete with Google, (and 
its future potential with a Sun/IBM partnership), Microsoft Windows might one 
day be given away for free! 
http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051103.html Imagine that. Has the 
success of Google, in a way, converted Bill Gates into a champion of free 
software? Stay tuned. -SR

CONTINUING DISCUSSION -- // 
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; TOPIC: 
GOOGLE PERSONAL SEARCH &quot;I find it hard to believe that the search engines 
will go to these lengths for personalization but use it only on paid search. If 
they think they can improve the organic results through personalization, I 
think they will. Now what will *that* mean to search marketing? Goodbye rank 
checkers&quot; From: SearchReturn With Yahoo!'s MyWeb personalized search 
results, and Google search personalization coming out of beta today, this is 
exactly how things are transpiring. Nick from Threadwatch noticed this message 
from a Google search today: 
http://www.threadwatch.org/images/googlepersonalizationui.jpg Stay tuned. -SR

ESSENTIAL NEWS -- // 
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; Yahoo! 
CTR Ranking 2006 http://www.searchreturn.com/digest/refs014.shtml Essentials: 
Yahoo! apparently will factor in CTR for ranking ads. During a quarterly 
investor call, Yahoo! described a new bidding system targeted for release in 
2006.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; 
Alibaba Baidu Competition http://www.searchreturn.com/digest/refs014.shtml 
Essentials: Statements that may be more dramatic than necessary include: 
&quot;If we don't move fast, within eight to 10 months, we don't have a 
chance.&quot;  
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; Search 
Usability http://www.alistapart.com:80/articles/accessibilityseo Essentials: 
When reading this post, rather than think of search engines as access 
challenged, think of them as rewarding your accessible design with better 
rankings. Search engines want to refer search users to sites where they can 
have some measure of assurance the site will display properly.  
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; Jagger 
Update Completing http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/jagger-winding-down/ 
Essentials: The last changes left for the Google Jagger index update are 
reserved for handling spam feedback. Google seems to have improved its ability 
to identify low-quality link ranking schemes. A shift from the ranking power 
associated with large numbers of off-topic links, links from link pages, and 
reciprocal linking in general, has shifted towards additional power for inbound 
links from trusted sites. It's a plainly obvious move.  
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; Search 
User Chart http://www.internetretailer.com/article.asp?id=16570 Essentials: 
Nice breakdown of search user motive differences between Yahoo!, Google, MSN, 
and AOL. As Danny pointed out in a recent SearchCast, people use Google for its 
search, and other sites that offer search for their other services. Yahoo! gets 
the only other respectable showing for their search.  
----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; Google 
Classified Ads http://www.searchreturn.com/digest/refs014.shtml Essentials: The 
story warrants a skeptical read, and it is certainly worth tracking. It may 
constitute a second revenue generating service by Google. It looks like it 
might simply extend its core advertising sales business.
