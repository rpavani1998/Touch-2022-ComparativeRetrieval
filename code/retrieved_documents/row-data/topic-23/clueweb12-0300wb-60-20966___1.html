<h1>MSN AdCenter Still Getting Better Results than Google, Yahoo</h1> <br>

<p>MSN's adCenter, still in beta, may not be in the running when it comes to 
search volume, but apparently quality - as a result of the demographic data it 
uses - is trumping quantity, producing better results for advertisers than 
Google or Yahoo, according toyet another search expert, writes 
InternetRetailer. &quot;Were seeing better results on MSN than on Google or 
Yahoo,&quot; Dave Williams, chief strategist of search engine marketing firm 
360i, is quoted as saying.<br>
<br>
 He says the reason is the demographic 
data, including age, sex and home city, that adCenter makes available - and 
Google and Yahoo don't, at least not yet.</p> 
<p>MSN is hoping adCenter will help it gain ground on Google and Yahoo. As of 
December, Google controlled 48.8 percent of the search market, followed by 
Yahoo at 21.4 percent and MSN at 10.9 percent, according to Nielsen/NetRatings.
