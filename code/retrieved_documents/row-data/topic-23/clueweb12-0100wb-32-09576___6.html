<p><b>Context Within Search and Optimization</b><br>
by Richard Zwicky<br>
<br>
A part of the problem in search engines relates to end users (you) expectations 
of what you will see in search results. I've run a few search query tests on 
the search engines recently. It's really an ongoing thing. I basically tested 
various wordings of the same question - &quot;things search engines look 
for&quot;; &quot;things that a search engine looks for&quot;; &quot;what search 
engines look for&quot;; and &quot;what a search engine looks for,&quot; to see 
how dramatically the different search results would actually vary if the 
wording, but not the intent or meaning of what I was querying actually changed. 
Therefore I was testing how well the search engines would actually understand 
context.<br>
<br>
Context is the next big frontier for the search engines. Two 
weeks ago Google announced it had purchased a UK based firm, principally for 
its contextual search capabilities; it begged the question how well was Google 
or any other engine, actually able to understand context within queries, at the 
present time. I won't bore you with all the details and data from all search 
engines for all the tests I ran - they all gave similar results. For the 
purposes of this article, in Google I used the queries &quot;what a search 
engine looks for&quot; and &quot;what search engines look for&quot;. Only 1 web 
site appeared for both queries in the top 25. (our site of course!) Yet 
contextually these are the same query, but the search engines proved they had 
no contextual analysis built into their search algorithms. The search results 
had little to do with Google understanding the context and more to do with; did 
the web site operator or optimizer understand content well enough as to ensure 
the necessary information was found by the search engines, within a web site. 
Having the properly optimized content would ensure that a relevant web site 
would be able to fulfill the needs of a variety of contextually similar queries 
from the search engines.<br>
<br>
This process of helping guide the search 
engine to better understand the context of a document, so that the engine can 
properly direct searchers to the right document, and thus ensure relevant 
results, is a the core of what any good search engine optimization firm must 
do. It should be at the core of every search engine algorithm, but obviously 
context is not yet there.<br>
<br>
It is however at the core of our new 
phraseology technology, which is being worked into our service at this time. 
Eventually, this technology will be able to string together contextually and 
grammatically correct sentences summarizing a document. At this time it will, 
when fully integrated, start stringing together contextual key messages in a 
fashion which logically improves search engine performance. Our existing 
technology already ensures that our web site is in the top 3 results for the 2 
queries mentioned above, but only just got us to the top 30 for the variant 
query &quot;what does a search engine look for.&quot; Phraseology will build 
upon and improve this concept. It will help boost your rankings in more search 
results than ever before.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see if Microsoft's 
new search engine due sometime next year, can do any better than the existing 
offerings. We keep hearing that it is going to be something better than Google. 
Alongside Yahoo pouring millions of dollars into combining FAST, Inktomi and 
Altavista into the new Yahoo! search tool, it will get more and more 
interesting. However, you must always remember that even if they all improve 
their contextual search abilities, they still need to be able to understand the 
proper context of the document that they are looking at. Our tests have proven 
the methodology, behind ensuring relevant placement based on content and 
context.<br>
