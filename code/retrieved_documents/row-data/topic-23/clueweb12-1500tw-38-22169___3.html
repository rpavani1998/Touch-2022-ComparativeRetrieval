<h1>Yahoo to Retain Search After Restructuring</h1> Posted on April 11, 2012 by

<p></p> 
<p>Just over a week ago, we reported that upcoming layoffs and restructuring 
could signal the end of Yahoo&rsquo;s search functionality. According to a memo 
penned by Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson and reported byAllThingsD, those fears can 
be put to bed &ndash; at least for now.</p> 
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s memo, which comes in the wake of his decision to fire over 
2,000 employees last week, outlines the company&rsquo;s new structure. Of 
course, there&rsquo;s no telling how long search will last, or whether Yahoo 
will pay even less attention to it than it does now (considering that Bing has 
been processing Yahoo&rsquo;s search queries since 2010).<br>
</p> 
<h2>A Brief Look at Yahoo&rsquo;s New Structure</h2> 
<p>Starting on May 1st 2012, Yahoo will be broken up into three major sections:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Technology</strong> (for platforms and infrastructure)</li> 
<li><strong>Regions</strong> (for dealing with advertisers and revenue)</li> 
<li><strong>Consumer</strong> (which will be broken up into three sub-units: 
Commerce, Connections and Media)</li> </ul> 
<p>Apparently, everything having to do with search will fall under the 
Connections sub-unit of the Consumer division. This is interesting given that 
an estimated 1,800 employees at Yahoo (out of about 14,000 total) are strictly 
devoted to search. Should Yahoo eventually decide to cut search altogether, 
which is entirely possible given recentsearch market share reports, these 
employees would presumably be going the same way as the 2,000 employees that 
were laid off last week.</p> 
<h2>Is Search Still Important to Yahoo?</h2> 
<p>Although Yahoo obviously isn&rsquo;t going to immediately admit otherwise, 
a cursory reading of Thompson&rsquo;s full memo indicates that search is far 
from Yahoo&rsquo;s top priority moving forward. In fact, search is only 
mentioned a single time in the Connections section of the memo. After 
announcing that the division will be led by Shashi Seth, Thompson says this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The highest priority for Shashi and his team will be to think well 
beyond how users search, communicate and share online today. The Connections 
team is charged with fundamentally re-imagining how we design and deliver the 
next generation of these foundational Yahoo! experiences.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The bottom line is that in terms of SEO, you&rsquo;ll be much better off 
optimizing for Google, Bing and even smaller private search engines like 
DuckDuckGo than for Yahoo.</p> 
<p>What do you think? Is Yahoo still relevant to search today, and if so, will 
they still be in six months or one year? Sound off in the comments below.</p>
