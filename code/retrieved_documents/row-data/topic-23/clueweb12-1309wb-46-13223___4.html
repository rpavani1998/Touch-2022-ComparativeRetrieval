<h2>Yahoo Announces Time Frame for Bing Organic Search</h2> July 15th, 2010 
<p>Back in February, 2010 Yahoo announced they will be transitioning to using 
Bing organic search results, and phasing out Yahoo&rsquo;s own organic search 
engine.</p> 
<p>Today Yahoo announced to their search advertisers the time frame for that 
will be &ldquo;August/September&rdquo;:</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;Assuming our testing continues to yield high quality results, we 
anticipate that our organic search results will be powered by Bing beginning in 
the August/September timeframe.</em>&ldquo;</p> 
<p>What does this mean for your SEO traffic from Yahoo?&nbsp; Well, it depends 
on how well you are doing in Bing today.</p> 
<p>To assess the potential impact, you can look at two things:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Compare current positions for important keywords in both Yahoo and Bing, 
and</li> 
<li>Look at your website analytics for traffic from each of Yahoo and Bing 
organic search engines.</li> </ol> 
<p>For current positions, do a sampling of keywords that are important to your 
website.&nbsp; Look at where you are in Bing and Yahoo for each of those.&nbsp; 
There are a number of automated tools to do this, such asCheckRankings.com and 
Web Position Gold.</p> 
<p>For analytics, this will depend on what tool you use, such as Google 
Analytics, WebTrends or Omniture.&nbsp; Look for keywords that send good 
traffic from Yahoo organic, and compare to Bing organic traffic for those same 
keywords. Be sure to separate out other sources, such as paid search traffic.
</p> 
<p>Bing search volume is about 67% of Yahoo, so if there are keywords where 
Yahoo volume is much higher than Bing (e.g., 2x or more), then you may want to 
put some effort in to improving Bing SEO for your site.&nbsp; This will be hard 
since Bing is still evolving from being more content-driven to including 
broader factors such as site quality and inbound linking, so it is a moving 
target.&nbsp; For now, however, look to be sure you have your keywords present 
on each relevant page, in the title tag, &lt;h1&gt; tag and body text.&nbsp; 
Also work to get inbound links that use those keywords in anchor text, and 
where the linking page uses your keywords in the page title and body 
text.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are standard SEO practices, and will help with both 
Bing and Google.</p> 
<p>Also be sure to register and check your settings for Bing webmaster tools 
for each of your sites.&nbsp; See&nbsp;http://www.bing.com/webmaster <br>
 One 
downside of this transition is that Microsoft still does not have very good 
tools for managing organic search results, and Yahoo had much 
better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully Microsoft will improve their tools, such as 
adding the ability to ignore URL parameters that do not impact content.</p> 
<p>Long term, this means we now have only two major search engines to monitor 
for SEO:&nbsp; Google and Bing.&nbsp; As of now, Google is about 63% market 
share, Yahoo 19% and Bing 12%.&nbsp; Ask.com has 4%, which for most sites is 
not enough to put effort into optimization.&nbsp; Given Bing will more than 
double in volume, and potentially have a 30% share, a more effort should be put 
into optimizing for Bing search.</p>
