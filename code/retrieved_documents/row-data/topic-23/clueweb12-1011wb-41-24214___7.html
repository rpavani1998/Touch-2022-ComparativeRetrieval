<h1>Search Engine Traffic Comparison &ndash; Google, Yahoo!, MSN</h1>  By Tony 
&sdot; November 18, 2006 &sdot; Post a comment <br>

<p> Analysis of search engine market shares is very inconsistent and varies by 
up to 50% from source to source. Some claim Yahoo to make up 1/4 of all 
searches, and place Google just slightly ahead. Others accredit the entire 
market to Google. Some bloggers have tried to performtheir own analysis, but 
the numbers closer to the truth are in the comments &ndash; how many hits do 
webmasters actually see? It seems that Google attributes to 75~85% of incoming 
search engine traffic, Yahoo at about 10~15% and MSN trailing at about 5%.</p> 
<p> Interested to find out for myself, I went looking closer through my access 
logs.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Over the last two months, CompSci.ca domain has recieved 20,000 unique 
visits, 4000 of which wereorganic. Google accounted for <strong>95.3%</strong>, 
while Yahoo made the remaining<strong>4.0%</strong> (0.7% unaccounted for.. 
possibly MSN). Feeling under appreciated by the<i>alternative</i> search 
engines, I went to research further.</p> 
<h2>How much do search engines index?</h2> 
<p> Using the <strong>site:</strong> metasearch, I was able to see how many 
pages each engine actually has indexed &ndash; that is, how many different 
pages can actually be found.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> site:compsci.ca </p> </blockquote> 
<p>The results seem to relate to the incoming traffic, possibly offering a 
first clue to this market.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Google</strong> &ndash; 26,300</li> 
<li><strong>Yahoo!</strong> &ndash; 2,623 (10% that of Google)</li> 
<li><strong>MSN</strong> &ndash; 130 (0.5% that of Google)</li> </ul> 
<p>Between 12,170 forum threads (10 posts per thread average), 4300 registered 
users, and all theWiki pages and various blogs, Google seems to have a pretty 
good coverage of the pages available. Others cover just a fraction.</p> 
<h2>How do indexes compare to other sites?</h2> 
<p> Though for a more empirical comparison, another related question must be 
answered &ndash;<i>&ldquo;How often does my website come up in search 
results?&rdquo;</i>. Since each engine has a vastly different indexed set size, 
there needs to be a way to compare them against themselves &ndash; against 
pages each search engine has indexed from other related websites.</p> 
<p> CompSci.ca&rsquo;s unique niche content is the Turing programming 
language. I wanted to know what percentage of suchniche searches result with 
one of my pages. A total of 6 searches were performed with each engine:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> computer science canada<br>
 site:compsci.ca computer science canada</p> 
<p>turing programming tutorials<br>
 site:compsci.ca turing programming 
tutorials</p> 
<p>&ldquo;hacker dan&rdquo;<br>
 site:compsci.ca &ldquo;hacker dan&rdquo; </p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Starting out with a general topic, moving on to niche, and finally a very 
specific keyword (this site&rsquo;s co-admin&rsquo;s alias).</p> 
<p> How do search engines compare?</p> / <strong>Google</strong> <strong>Yahoo!

dan&rdquo; 4,000 375 89 <br>
Percent: <strong>27.97%</strong> <strong>15.82%
</strong> <strong>3.95%</strong> <br>
<br>

<h2>What does this all mean?</h2> 
<p> Google indexes more. Much, much more. Though it is interesting to note 
that while Yahoo! has indexed just 10% of compsci.ca webpages that Google has, 
the ratio is not the same for all of the web. On<strong>computer science canada
</strong> topic, Yahoo! has 50% of Google&rsquo;s results, and MSN has 7%. 
Decending into a more specific topic of<strong>turing programming tutorials
</strong>, Yahoo! shows just 17% of Google&rsquo;s indexed pages, but assuming 
that compsci.ca is indeed the most accurate source on the topic, it&rsquo;s 
interesting to note that Yahoo! results in 3 times the accurate (mine!) 
matches. Better yet, MSN&rsquo;s tiny 1% index size results in the best match 
for what I&rsquo;m really looking for &ndash;<strong>MSN has 28 times better 
concentration of niche content results than Google</strong>!. </p> 
<p> <strong>&ldquo;hacker dan&rdquo;</strong> is a very peculiar case to 
consider. Once again Yahoo! shows just 17% of Google&rsquo;s indexes, and so 
does MSN. And while 1/3 of Google&rsquo;s results point back at compsci.ca, one 
should keep in mind that Dan accounts for<strong>3807</strong> of the forum 
posts, and since Google has indexed just about every thread, it&rsquo;s natural 
that his signature would come up this much.<strong>Yahoo! and MSN, now on par 
in results, display a much broader variety of content</strong>. </p> 
<h2>Bottom line of search engine comparison</h2> 
<p> Google will index every page it can get to. Your content will be stored 
and accessable, but likely lost in the web of<i>every other page out there</i>. 
A fine-tuned search query is a powerful tool.</p> 
<p>Yahoo! index size is smaller. They try to be Google, but are falling 
behind. Not much more to be said here for now.</p> 
<p>MSN resulted in a surprise. MSN offers a tiny index in comparison, but it 
might be making up with the quality and variety of results. MSN offered the 
best concentration of results on a topic, and a far better concentration of 
good results for a specific niche topic. Very interesting to note that in 
search for a very specific keyword, MSN resulted in the least hits to a 
specific site, but a much broader variety of choices.</p> 
<h2>My conclusion to search engine traffic</h2> 
<p> Yahoo! and especially MSN appear to put variety of resources over the raw 
quantity. Since every forum thread looks similar, a large portion of them gets 
neglected. In order to increase the appearance of your website in index, I 
would recommend offering unique content from page to page. A closer look at the 
index of this blog specifically<strong>site:compsci.ca/blog</strong> supports 
this theory, as Google, Yahoo! and MSN have indexed 56, 56, and 55 pages 
respectively.</p> 
<p> I would love to hear what kind of search traffic others have been getting, 
and what I can do to tap into those 15% that Yahoo! supposedly offers.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s actaully pretty interesting, I normally use Google to do all 
my searching, but I never thought that MSN or Yahoo! might have more relevent 
or better quality results.</p>
