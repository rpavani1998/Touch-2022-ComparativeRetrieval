Solutions &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft Training: Windows 7 Better than Linux 
<br> 
<h1>Microsoft Training: Windows 7 Better than Linux</h1>  6:51 PM - September 
8, 2009 by Marcus Yam - source: Tom's Hardware US <br>

<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Microsoft up to its tricks.</strong></p> 
<p>Many companies across many industries partake in some form of evangelism 
(though some would call it propaganda) for its products. Some of the best 
evangelism starts at the retail level, where employees can 'inform' the buying 
consumer while trying to sell a life-saving in-store warranty policy.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A Best Buy employee, who happens to also be an overclock.net forum poster, 
recently partook in a Microsoft ExpertZone training exercise (with the 
incentive to be able to buy Windows 7 for $10) encountered materials from 
Microsoft that push certain superiorities that Windows 7 possess over Linux. 
While some points were valid, others were untrue.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the slides that Microsoft used (above) is fairly misleading, as 
World of Warcraft is supported in Linux through WINE. Windows Live Essentials 
are indeed a Windows-only product, but there are many other free alternatives. 
Video chat is also supported well on Linux through Skype and Pidgin.See here a 
mirror of the original thread.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It seems that Microsoft is trying to fight off Linux machines that are sold 
through Best Buy, which if any, are netbooks only. We can't imagine that there 
will be many customers who will wander into Best Buy without a clue of which 
operating system he or she should go with &ndash; the new and shiny Windows 7 
or the mysterious, counter-culture Linux.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Well it's true, dunno what Microsoft said, but I definably believe myself 
that Windows is better than Linux (unless you're doing something Linux worthy 
like a web server or some cluster or anything).<br>
<br>
For gaming, 
entertainment, day to day stuff Windows is better, has more apps, more options, 
and usually not a big deal finding drivers or configuring some weird stuff.<br>

<p>Microsoft FUDs about Linux again, quite typical. Not really news anymore. 
It's true that Linux has limited software support but a good chunk just ain't 
true.</p> supertrek32  09/09/2009 1:31 AM <br>

<p>screen shot looks true enough to me. I don't think wine is part of linux. 
It may be included in some distributions but it afaik is not built into the 
kernel. Also I lack knowledge of the other features but I would assume that 
limited on all that stuff is true. They aren't saying not supported for 
multimedia, just limited. Meaning that there are programs just not as many as 
for Windows which more than likely is true.<br>

When I go to a popular 
download site such as download.com and search for software, the majority of the 
results are windows based. hence why it generally makes little sense to go out 
and buy a mac and rely entirely on mac osx (which is a modified beos, a type of 
unix). And yeah I know you can google for linux software. You guys writing this 
article think that most Windows/mac osx users would be able to install all the 
hardware and software they want? Think again, linux is not a newbie o/s and 
most people aren't going to put the effort in all the training involved in 
setting up linux. At least M$ isn't going on here claiming that win7 is a 
better solution than linux for use as a server o/s so I don't really see much 
point in why this article was written.</p> rooket  09/09/2009 1:39 AM <br>

It was installed on my coworker's home computer but mcafee 
forced me to uninstall it. It seemed like a decent piece of software but 
between mcafee and ms live essentials I'd want to check other vendors besides 
those two. M$ has been a total slouch about their malware protection over the 
years and mcafee as well. Norton right now is the best one but even they don't 
catch everything.<br>
<br>
And yeah I know the other features in live 
essentials such as automatic defrag and such. That stuff is cool and all but 
how often do you realy need to defrag a windows drive? once a day? no, I didn't 
think so. it is very rare for me to need a defrag and it generally has no 
performance benefit on anything I do it on regardless if the drive is 22% 
fragmented or 11%, once it is done defragging the PC runs exactly the same.

<p>I'd give Microsoft the benefit on gaming, but media playback is a wash, 
especially with MS incorporating new DRM in its operating systems starting with 
Vista. Windows almost always requires a codec pack, and without 3rd-party 
software, it's not easy to tell which codecs are installed and which are not. 
In Ubuntu at least (probably one of the more media-friendly distros) just add 
Medibuntu repositories, and you're good to go. Adding repositories could be 
more straightforward, but it's by no means &quot;hard.&quot;<br>
Other than 
gaming, the only thing keeping me on Windows is Adobe Creative Suite. I can't 
build and customize my rig if I go Mac, and that's the only other platform 
Adobe supports.<br>
<br>
As for hardware, I've had more hardware troubles with 
Windows than with Linux. XP still won't find my Brother wireless laser printer. 
Ubuntu was happy to install it on both my desktop and laptop without complaint. 
Maybe that speaks more of Brother than of Microsoft, though. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>This shows how much of a threat linux is to windows. I still think Windows 
is a better OS for personal use and single user mode. Linux is also very good, 
but it's free (the ones I used) which means a lot of the software is very 
unstable. In terms of features and stability, Openoffice.org still has a long 
way to go... but... it's getting closer and closer.</p> pacostrano  09/09/2009

programs that you can play LOTS of windows games with Linux and btw Microsoft 
Used before Linux for their own server because they don't even thrust their own

Wrong. Linux is great for every day use esp. 
considering how many viruses,etc are out in the wild aimed at Windows. If you 
use Torrents, Linux is the way to go.<br>

Agreed. It's NOT hard to run Linux any more. With Yast2,etc the days 
of dependency hell are usually solved. I mainly use Linux for every day stuff 
now, only use Windows for gaming, CS4, SolidWorks,Inventor. And yes, I do run 
Windows 7 x64 and Vista x64 and XP x64.<br>

Again, wrong. Linux has much better security and low over head. Why do you 
think most web servers run LAMP? And FIY Linux does cost quite a bit to deploy 
on the cooperate scale yet people still do it due to the benefit.<br>

That's a moot point. 
Skype or AIM are also not part of the Windows kernel.<br>
<br>

[/citation] <br>
No, most of those claims are flat-out lies. No 
authorized support for Linux? Tell that to Canonical, Novell, or Red Hat. 
Driver support goes both ways, too. My HP LaserJet 1012 worked out-of-the-box 
on Linux. On Vista? I couldn't get it to work for over a year until finally HP 
decided to release a driver. There are lots of older devices which vendors 
don't support under Vista/7 but Linux compatibility is provided by the kernel 
or by standard, open-source drivers.<br>
<br>
[citation] <br>
 hence why it 
generally makes little sense to go out and buy a mac and rely entirely on mac 
osx (which is a modified beos, a type of unix). And yeah I know you can google 
for linux software. You guys writing this article think that most Windows/mac 
osx users would be able to install all the hardware and software they want? 
Think again, linux is not a newbie o/s and most people aren't going to put the 
effort in all the training involved in setting up linux.<br>
[/citation] <br>

<br>Again, I disagree. I've set up a dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu for my 
parents. It turns out my mostly computer-illiterate parents CHOOSE to use Linux 
for many tasks since they find it simpler.

OSX is not based off of BeOS, it is based off of NeXTSTEP. NeXT 
was the company Steve Jobs co-founded after he left Apple, that was later 
bought by Apple instead of Be. Also, BeOS isn't even a type of Unix, NeXTSTEP 
was based off of Unix. Anyway, there are plenty of sites with Apple freeware 
and hardly anyone would Google for Linux software, that is what package 
managers are for.

Is 
that a joke? You bet the majority will be for windows, Download.com has been a 
bloat ware site for Shareware based applications for which alternatives could 
be found (Most of the time) on http://sourceforge.net/. God, I found about 
download.com a long time after I first found sourceforge.net. Some one needs to 
learn how to use his internet in a better way.

<p>There is probably more software for Linux than windows if you count the 
small projects.<br>
<br>
Who would even expect Windows Live Essentials to work 
on Linux? It's a GOOD thing it doesn't work on Linux because it's a load of 
crapware anyway and there are much better GPL programs.<br>
<br>
Linux does not 
have a lack of support for games, the games have a lack of support for Linux. 
The problem is the reverse of what the slide says. Wine is not Linux support. 
Wine is Windows libraries on Linux.<br>
<br>
As for Authorised support, that's 
a load of rubbish. there are several commercial distributions with full 
support. Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux come to mind.</p>

<p>Yes you can just run so many bloated windows applications on that netbook. 
Of course trying to use that running program is gonna be another story. Anyway 
I find it hard to imagine any netbook running WoW (much less any modern game) 
at any reasonable speed. As for the Windows Live Essentials bit, I can't 
imagine actually worrying about that when most default installs of Linux have 
much better alternatives.<br>
<br>
Just so many things wrong with that 
training, ack, bull shit meter exploding (must be an iPhone App). As for the 
quip about different versions of Linux just how many different versions of Win7 
do they plan to put out? As a web developer I'm pretty tied to Adobe Creative 
Suite more than is good for me. I've tried to wine it, but too many small 
annoyances really. Well that and games keep me glued to Windows more than Linux.

<p>I don't see what the fuss is.<br>
<br>
Windows live essentials is a windows 
only option.<br>
<br>
Windows does support video on ALL major IM programs and 
linux doesn't (this isn't to say linux doesn't support it it just doesn't 
support all of them)<br>
<br>
Windows runs just about every game natively 
without emulation and linux doesn't.<br>
<br>
Most linux distro's use 
communities to provide support rather than a formal support regime and those 
that do exist have been pretty limited in my experience.<br>
<br>
Hardware 
support for windows is by far better than linux. Ever had a device that 
wouldn't work in any version of Windows? I don't think so.<br>
<br>
So is this 
really some big lie being spread? Because the only potential point of 
contention I can really see is the authorised support sections.</p> randomizer

As it should be. It's 
not exactly a reason why Windows 7 is better though. It's like saying Windows

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is 
not a reason why Windows is better than Linux per se. Linux is not the problem, 
the game developers and publishers are the problem. Of course, to the end user 
it looks like a Linux problem and Microsoft is preying on that ignorance here.
<br> <br>

pretty limited in my experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you don't pay for 
the software then nobody is obligated to provide support. It's completely 
logical. If you want support you have to pay, whether that be commercial Linux 
distributions or Windows (or OSX for that matter).<br>
<br>
<b>kato128 :</b><br>
Hardware support for windows is by far better than linux.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>That is debatable. For some devices, like wireless hardware, this is 
certainly true. For other devices, particularly very old ones, windows no 
longer has support. Windows 7 has almost completely dropped support for my 
6-year-old printer.<br>
<br>
<b>kato128 :</b><br>
So is this really some big 
lie being spread? Because the only potential point of contention I can really 
see is the authorised support sections.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is more an issue 
of twisting the facts than blatant lies. Many points are true in select 
situations but Microsoft are proclaiming them as global fact.<br>

<p>Of course Windows is better. I've tried Windows, Ubuntu, MacOSX(Hackintosh) 
and have 4 OS on my PC at one time. I've never used a MAC OSX in my life, but 
after 1 week, i totally fall in love with it.<br>
<br>
As for UBUNTU, i've 
tried to like it and use it for a few months. In the end, the trouble is far 
more than what it's worth. It's hardly user friendly, looks crap and slower 
than a MAC OSX.<br>
<br>
Eventually i throw it out of my PC forever. Linux 
really does suck. And i'm a techie. I can see why the average consumer just 
won't touch it.</p> captaincharisma  09/09/2009 4:58 AM <br>

please explain to the class why its better to 
use it for everyday use. everyday you get roadblocks from webpages that use 
windows media player for links to videos, for internet when you have to install 
plugins you have to run complex scripts which can take god knows how long vs 
windows where it is just one install package. then there is office where 
microsoft office is used by 99% of the work and education world and with 
openoffice being free its not 100% reliable when it comes with compatibility. 
so your the one who is wrong and keeps clutching on to his free copy of ubuntu 
that you had to spend 5.99 to get in the mail<br>

linux is only for 
everyday use for hackers and the hardcore nerds which is why viruses are not 
popular on linux.</p> kato128  09/09/2009 5:08 AM <br>

<p>@Randomizer: Yeah I see your point there. It looks like it's a tricky use 
of context. So while nothing is completely untrue it's not completely honest 
either and taking it as a global truth could be very misleading. Basically this 
kind of thing highlights the old adage &quot;buyer beware&quot;.</p> randomizer

Microsoft is a corporation. You have to 
expect their marketing team to do this as that's what they're paid to do - 
persuade the buyer in any way possible.

<p>I love Linux for work, it's ultra fast and very flexible in the right 
hands. My work desktop is as customizable as any, shinier and prettier than 
Win7 with tons of usability and all my options are always available to me.<br>

<br>But, let's face it. For usability, the popular OS wins (unfortunately), and 
I run Vista at home for my laptop and desktop. The reasons are getting less and 
less to do so, and I'm sure people can get me alternatives on some level for 
all of the apps I use.<br>
<br>
Yes, Linux works great for older hardware and 
at work where you use standardized workstation platforms (we use Dell 
Precisions) but newer proprietary ones like laptops? It sucks, seriously. This 
has more to do with the manufacturer for not providing good drivers or open 
sourcing the ones they have but it still sucks to deal with.<br>
<br>
For my 
desktop, my only real excuse is gaming. With modern games these days flakey out 
of the box, do I want to wrap it into Wine? No. Sure given enough time, I can 
tweak a majority of my games to work - but that's it, time. At work, it's my 
job to tweak things, make it work, utilize the stability of Linux for uptime 
etc. But at home? Is your time that cheap?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I still 
use it for my home NAS, and I dual boot it on my desktop. But driver issues, 
game and application compatibility is holding it back.<br>
<br>
I agree with 
one commenter that manufacturers are very slow or simply not updating drivers 
for their older devices. I personally had two that had to go - my HP Laserjet 
1000 and surprisingly my microsft webcam</p> radguy  09/09/2009 5:58 AM <br>

<p>Cant be any worse than the bull sh** the apple guy in the BestBuy store was 
trying to convince me of. A couple weeks ago looking at laptops and he came 
over and tried to convince me to buy a mac. Bad idea I'll try to make this 
quick.<br>
He wanted me to buy a 13inch macbook pro over a dell studio 14z 
700bucks.<br>
I told him if i went online i could get the dell studio 14z 
better spected with a higher resolution what I think is really important for 
under a grand. He moved on about the superiority of OSX. I told him the win 7 
rc was running pretty good and I really thought the gui was a little better 
cause its pretty much stolen and modded from OSX anyway. Somewhere allong the 
way he went on to say that the CPU on windows ran at 20%-40% at idle and on OSX 
it ran at 0%.<br>
Moving on to desktops cause I was like I cant build my own pc 
he was saying that an E8200 in the imac was better than an E8200 in a windows 
machine. The cpu was built different and therefore better ie faster than a pc 
with the same E8200. He also tried to convince me that having 2 gb of DDR3 
would beat 4gb of ddr2 hands down. I have nothing against apple just that their 
computers aren't right for me personally and I might not big on their 
advertising. I could go on with this guy.<br>
Anyway I don't think anything 
microsoft over linux has done can top apples umm I am the best thing in world 
and will say anything to convice you of that tactic.<br>

<p>what a joke this artikle is LOL<br>
don't believe it at all.<br>
no mp3 
support ? my butt. anything portable i connected, it worked perfect, even my 
cell phone carrier's usb modem that NEEDED drivers for windows.<br>
no camera 
support ? my 4ss. every camera is supported i connected till this day (sony, 
fuji, canon, nikon, ... )<br>
no printers ? i guess how many printer drivers 
are natively in windows. for everything you need to search the net... even for 
video drivers. what a shame. with ubuntu a single click, and jockey will 
install it without an extra click or whatever.<br>
software compatibility. what 
is the goal of linux use ? use of windows software ? that's not. if so, use 
MICROSOFT, not linux based OS.<br>
windows live messenger ? then what is 
emesene ? install with a single click, it's on ubuntu's multiverse, or get 
ubuntu tweak, and a single click will install it. don't need to search the net 
for it.<br>
games. linux isn't for games, but if your a game fan, then wine, 
cedega, crossover will do the trick for most games (wow works with cedega VERY 
GOOD)<br>
authorized support for what ? there are a lot of forums where you can 
get help, a lot better than microsoft help for free.<br>
video chat ? most of 
webcamera drivers are already installed in the 2.6 kernels, get a linux based 
chat protocoll and you get webcam.<br>
<br>
i think THIS artikle is a 
propaganda, M$ paind tom$hardware to advertise M$<br>

<p>This is mainly just a marketing campaign, except it's not targeted at 
customers but at middle-men like Best Buy employees.<br>
The 
&quot;security&quot; thing gave me a laugh, and they also claimed it wasn't 
clear whether Linux updated critical vulnerabilities quickly or not, or that it 
was harder to install programs and updates. I have a hard time believing that 
even the marketing peeps at MS have never heard of a package manager, so that 
much is just straight up bullshit.<br>
<br>
I skipped Vista in favor of Ubuntu, 
back when Vista was having its toothing problems. I'll probably get Windows 7 
and dual-boot for my next desktop build.<br>
Though if my current Ubuntut/XP 
laptop is any indication even Windows 7 might not get much love.</p> enforcer22

<p>[citation][nom]randomizer[/nom]Linux does not have a lack of support for 
games, the games have a lack of support for Linux. The problem is the reverse 
of what the slide says. citation]<br>
<br>
Actualy its both.. Linux isnt a 
single OS linux isnt unified. linux can support things from one distro and not 
support things from another. On the other hand. Why even attempt to make a game 
for a platform that has 1 in probly 10,000 people using it. Ill even bet its a 
smaller number then that but still. Why make a game period for OPENGL Now dont 
get me wrong i preffer opengl from the old days over directx. but hell they 
cant even get any good options in that api anymore. bring it up to speed.<br>

<br>I totaly agree if linux wasnt free it would have likely been forgotten. The 
coperate deplyment argument is irrelavent. they use all kinds of os's no ones 
even heard of let alone suitable for the end user.<br>
<br>
Im not anti linux 
im just anti bullshit. Want native run games on linux? get all these open 
source freeware idiots off thier ass's and standardise thier software. and do 
something to get support other then &quot;we are the tree hugging hippy retards 
that make better things for the consumer because we arent greedy corperate 
money mongering capitalists.&quot; people dont care about that hippy shit. the 
only way they will get the support is to push for it not expect people to give 
a damn about them cuz they are &quot;open source&quot; or &quot;better&quot;.
