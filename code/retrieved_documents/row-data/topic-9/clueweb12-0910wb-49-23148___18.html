<h3>Tiny 1% Linux = Big Microsoft Terror</h3>  By Carla Schroder on May 28, 
2009 10:47 PM | Permalink | Comments (22) | TrackBacks (0) <br>
 I don't 
believe that the desktop Linux market share is barely 1%. I think it is a lot 
higher. I have no good data to share; I base my assessment on experience and 
knowing the industry. There is something else that is even more persuasive, and 
that is how Microsoft behaves. If Linux is so insignificant, why do they pay so 
much attention to it? Like this new ASUS/Windows Eee PC &quot;It's Better With 
Windows&quot; ad campaign:
<p> </p> 
<blockquote> It's Better With Windows <br>
 &quot;Windows helps you quickly 
and easily get online and connect to your devices and services-- without 
dealing with an<i>unfamiliar environment</i> or <i>major compatibility issues
</i>.&quot; </blockquote> 
<p> </p>  Watch the videos, they're pretty funny. Notice the carefully-ethnic 
Leave It to Beaver family, with stressed-out dad off to workaholic-ville all 
the time, while perfect housewife and children visit absent Dad via Windows 
Live Messenger. They even go to the beach without him. (Dad has forgotten how 
to shave or wash, which may be why they don't let him come home.)
<p> The ads are pretty good, which means they must have been produced by Asus 
because Microsoft has never ever been able to produce a decent ad campaign. (I 
had nightmares over those pervy guys in big blue butterfly suits invading 
people's homes; that was beyond creepy.) The last one is unintentionally 
hilarious because it hypes &quot;Windows Family Safety.&quot; Dad gets to be 
the hero here; he is actually home, though still unshaven and wrinkled, and he 
gets to protect young son from Internet evils with Family Safety From Windows 
Live One-Care. All Dad has to do is click some checkboxes, and son is safe. 
Hurrah!</p> 
<p> Trusted. Familiar. Compatible. Quite true, since the Eee PC is running XP. 
I guess they won't say things like &quot;Antiquated. Your familiar, friendly 
viruses and worms, and all the performance defects you've become accustomed to. 
For all of our billions we can't advance beyond an eight-year old operating 
system, or fix the darned thing.&quot;</p> 
<p> It's a direct shot at Linux, so I guess that little bitty one percent is a 
bigger one percent than it's given credit for. Some have questioned if these 
ads are legitimate, and claim they are satire or a hoax.ASUS links to them, so 
they're for real.</p>

<p>Yeah- I was thinking: &quot;I wish I could use an antiquated OS with more 
viruses than a 3rd floor Amsterdam window lady. And while I'm at it, I wish I 
could type school book reports on a 83% keyboard while laying on a bed. I guess 
I'll just have to stick with my bleeding edge technology and ergonomic 
workstation.</p> May 29, 2009 2:31 AM <br>

<p>Wasn't there a powerpoint slide from some presentation that Ballmer did a 
couple of months back that showed what MS believed the current international 
market installed OS share was, i.e. as opposed to the US-centric sales view 
most market share figures take? There were no numbers, and Ballmer was making 
the point that Windows biggest competition was pirated copies of Windows. What 
nobody else much seemed to pick up, and what Ballmer himself never mentioned, 
was that the Linux slice of the pie-chart he showed was almost as big as the 
Mac OSX slice, at what I would guess would be around 10% of the pie. And that's 
why they are so afraid.</p> May 29, 2009 7:58 AM <br>

<p>Say what you will about Microsoft's other products, they truly do <b>excel
</b> at creating FUD. They'll never grant anyone <b>access</b> to their code. 
They have developed an<b>entourage</b> of followers, fanboys and developers. 
But they remain the world's premier producer of fear, uncertainty and doubt.<b>
Word</b>!</p> May 29, 2009 8:45 AM <br>

<p>I kind of like to use Microsoft's own words: &quot;In a world without walls 
.... who needs Windows?&quot;, of course I edited it to make sense.</p> May 29,

<p>More importantly, Microsoft are anti-competitively applying a tax to the 
10% that reformat and install Linux.</p> 
<p>This is a legal issue that must be furthered. In no other market could 
companies get away with such clear and blatant illegal behaviour.</p> May 29,

<p>Where can you E-mail Asus and tell them that you no longer will do business 
with them?</p> May 29, 2009 1:35 PM <br>

<p>I don't care what Micro$oft does or does not do. I'm sticking with Linux. I 
am Linux!<br>

<p>Ms have way more to fear from OS X than crappy Open Office-based Linux. 
People dump Linux netbooks simply because OpenOffice is so bad. The Excel clone 
is particilary weak - even weaker than Office 2008 (which Microsoft have 
purposely not supported vs. 2007).</p> May 29, 2009 2:33 PM <br>

<br> 
<p>Wow, I would expect linux today to run a whois. Asus.co.uk isn't on the 
ASUS DNS servers -.- Its owned by a private UK citizen. Also, if you read the 
whole thing it is quite different from EVERY SINGLE OTHER AD ON ANY ASUS SITE. 
claims a 92% scale keyboard versus other ads which just call the keyboard 
&quot;ergonomic&quot;. Anti-microsoft hate runs so high in the linux community 
it blinds you to basic common sense and skepticism. The ads are the only thing 
that even look remotely real, but HD camcorders and tripods are cheap.</p> 
<p>Major Disappointment and fail at investigative journalism.</p> May 29, 2009

Carla Schroder  said: <br>

<p>You haven't proven anything, Kelson. Vunet claims they verified that the 
site is legitimate:<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<blockquote> <br>
 &quot;Asus confirmed to vnunet.com that the campaign was 
legitimate...&quot;<br>
http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/ <br>

2243158/asus-microsoft-join-forces<br>
</blockquote> 
<p><br>
 The story has been prominent for several days now, and neither ASUS 
nor Microsoft have issued denials. It is mentioned on ASUS forums with no 
denials:<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<blockquote> <br>
http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?board_id=20&amp;model= 
<br>Eee+PC+1002HAE&amp;id=20090526115622143&amp;page <br>

<br> <br>
 &quot; Topic : [Feedback and Suggestion]Campaign - Its Better With 
Windows&quot;<br>
</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
 If it is a hoax, what's the point? It's very elaborate and there is 
no punchline. If you're going to call hatred and hoax, you need something more 
than WHOIS data, which in this case are not even close to a smoking gun.</p>

 Some guy said: <br>

<p>Carla, I wondered if it might be a fake. So I did the whole whois stuff 
that others have mentioned, without much luck. Then I ran a few commands to 
download everything at thehttp://www.asus.co.uk domain. It turns out that the 
information page about the 1000HE (and its link to the Windows campaign) is the 
only original page at that site.<i>Everything else</i> redirects to 
http://uk.asus.com. At first I thought to myself, wow, it really must be fake. 
But who on earth would go to such great lengths for something that is to all 
intents and purposes an epic trolling moment? And<i>now</i> I see from your 
replies to others in this blog that Asus have confirmed that the campaign is 
real after all. This whole thing, frankly, is completely bizarre. What do you 
suppose is actually going on, here?</p> May 29, 2009 5:04 PM <br>

<p> There may be quite some number of folks who are using a &quot;Linux 
LiveCD&quot; to &quot;go online&quot; and not a whole lot more.....</p> 
<p> I have given a &quot;live CD&quot;to several friends, and a shoe loving 
absolutely no-tech daughter too, telling them to use the CD whenever they plan 
on doing nothing other than going online to browse/surf/what-ever, with a 2 
minute explanation of how to boot into them and then go online in a safe and 
secure environment.<br>
 I would imagine there are others who have done this 
too....</p> May 29, 2009 7:43 PM <br>
Carla Schroder  said: <br>

<p>Some guy, that is a good question. It could be a trial, a test to see if 
it's worth launching as a bigger campaign. It could be a big dumb blunder, 
which wouldn't be the first time Microsoft made a hash of a new ad campaign. 
Even though it appears on Asus' site, I bet that Microsoft is behind it because 
they are notorious for pushing Windows to the front of the line, no matter how 
it might damage their partners. It could be a rogue marketing person or team. 
If it does turn out to be a hoax I will laugh only if a very clever reason for 
it is revealed :)</p> May 29, 2009 7:51 PM <br>

<p>Any copy is good copy. Its free advertising for ASUS.</p> 
<p>whois itsbetterwithwindows.com - GoDaddy in the U.S. and some guy with a 
Hotmail account. The commercial is actually repetitive and I who thinks that 
Works is a great selling point. It does show 4 minutes worth of ASUS.</p> 
<p>There isn't much from ASUS to make me think its legit.</p> 
<p>It may be a Linux joke. </p> 
<p>What a deal pretty laptops. Microsoft Works. Family Safe. Its kind of funny 
when you think about it.</p> 
<p>The way that the logo is being used is probably illegal.<br>

<p>So much for legit.</p> May 29, 2009 8:51 PM <br>

<p>The funniest thing about the video is that the kids are using Microsoft 
Works for their homework..... the file formats of which are not compatible with 
ANYTHING, including Microsoft Office. Let's see how quickly they start crying 
when they cannot open that cute ppt or doc from their friends....</p> May 29,

<p>I'm surprised why Micro$soft didn't use something more appealing like 
&quot;Get the facts&quot;...<br>
 ....whooops they already used that in the 
past...what did that help..?<br>
 Apart from raising FUD, and occasional laughs 
from people who knows better.</p> 
<p>I'll stick with Linux, whenever I can, - which is on all computers apart 
from the kids PC (due to games) and my work-laptop (company rules/policies).</p>

<p>Maybe it is their having to drop the price of XP from about $50 to $5 and 
whatever other &quot;tricks&quot; they had to pull in order to &quot;win&quot; 
back the netbook market...<br>
 But I suspect that it has something to do with 
the % of those XP licenses on shiny new netbooks that have NEVER been activated 
or phoned home... (If they haven't &quot;phoned home&quot; to Redmond and they 
haven't been returned then what happened to them... Hint: I'm posting this from 
one of them...)</p> May 30, 2009 11:55 AM <br>

<p>Hmm I almost bought a new asus netbook when I saw this crap. I've been 
trying to figure out if its real or not so i can either boycott asus or buy 
myself a sweet new netbook (had my eyes on a 1000he). The most convincing 
evidence that its real is this:</p> 
<p>
http://promotions.newegg.com/ASUS/041609/?cm_sp=Subcat_Netbooks-_-ASUS/041609-_-http%3a%2f%2fpromotions.newegg.com%2fASUS%2f041609%2f478x88.jpg
</p> 
<p>I'm going to wait about a week and see if I can find out for sure if this 
real or fake before buying anything. I can see how people would think its petty 
to boycott asus entirely over this, sure business is business and to the 
average user windows might be what they want. But its all about how they're 
presenting this propaganda. Are asus netbooks better with windows? The answer 
is... it depends on who you are and what you're using it for. For me, linux is 
much much better. I personally hate windows and microsoft with a fiery passion 
for a number of reasons. I also couldn't care less if someone wants to use 
windows but to launch a propaganda campaign buddying up with microsoft like 
this? Ugh. Its just disgusting.</p> 
<p>Maybe we linux users are still a bit touchy after getting stabbed in the 
back by SCO but it seems to me they first come out supporting the idea of 
people choosing their own OS without the bias and lame smear campaign, then 
sell out to microsoft (probably for a large some of money) and join in their 
effort to screw the open source community. I hope I'm wrong because its really 
hard to find a netbook with a decent keyboard layout. Dell, unfortunately, is 
about the only other maker who has the control, tab, shift and tilde keys all 
in the correct places and that just drives me silly when they screw up the 
keyboard SILLY I tell you!</p> May 30, 2009 6:53 PM <br>

<p>Asus has gone the full 90 on this which leads me to believe Microsoft are 
paying them for the privilege of putting their product on Asus hardware.</p>

<p>Fake Video!<br>
<br>
 That marketing video is completely fraudulent. There 
is NO WAY The video rendering of web pages is that fast from a click action on 
netbooks with windows.<br>
<br>
 With Ubuntu 9.04 you can get speeds close to 
that opening a second window in firefox.<br>

<p>well personaly i bought a asus n10jc-hv006 netbook its brilliant little 
netbook. in saying that i found the windows xp that was installed lacking so i 
removed it and installed mandriva linux instead and now i get much better 
performance - i must add i upgraded it to 2gb ram and 500gb sata hdd</p> 
<p>and now my apps and gaming is even better runing wow on it is a lot 
smoother than it ever was in windows , the compressed 1024x768 resolution with 
the new nvidia drivers for windows xp is horrible..<br>
 I also hate windows 
for alot of reasons ,, but find what they are doing are wrong!</p> 
<p>the chief of department of education here signed contract with M$ stating 
that any device used by edu department that has a capability to run windows 
operating system must have a license key purchased regardless of the fact that 
the servers run with linux, and a lot of the department use the google android 
phones.</p> 
<p>just another monopoly,, But Asus netbooks are so much better with linux in 
my honest opinion.<br>
