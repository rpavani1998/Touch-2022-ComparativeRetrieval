<h2>System Resource Comparison of several distros running lightweight Linux 
Window Managers</h2>  Sunday, February 19th, 2012 | Arizona Linux | 4 Comments 
<br> <br>

<p>In this piece I will show how the system usage differs among Live CD 
distributions running different Linux Windows Managers mainly on distros 
considered to be lightweight. The first distro we will look at is a bit dated, 
but it is the most recent Fluxbox edition of Linux Mint,<em>Linux Mint 9 
Fluxbox edition</em>, and is a damn fine distro that I must say looks great and 
it&rsquo;s fun to use. The next lowest contender in regards to initial system 
usage is<em>PCLinuxOS 2011.08 Openbox edition</em>. Thirdly, we are looking at 
<em>Crunchbang 10 (Statler)</em> running Openbox. Finally, for 
comparison&rsquo;s sake we also looked at the modern, full-featured Gnome 
distro,<em>Linux Mint 12</em>. We booted each distro using default boot 
options, then opened a terminal window and ran the &lsquo;<strong>top</strong> 
&lsquo; command.</p> 
<p><strong>Linux Mint 9 Fluxbox edition</strong></p> 
<p>As you can see, this distro comes in at a svelte 536 MB of RAM usage upon 
intial boot</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>PCLinuxOS 2011.08 Openbox edition</strong></p> 
<p>Next, we see a still slim offering from the PCLinuxOS team which comes in 
at 580 MB (this distro also curiously only saw 388MB of my 1GB swap space on my 
HD??)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Crunchbang 10 (Statler)</strong></p> 
<p>The last offering we are looking at today is the latest Crunchbang distro, 
based on Debian that comes in at a very surprising 815 MB of RAM &ndash; 
I&rsquo;m really puzzled by that number and I&rsquo;d love to know why it comes 
in so high on this test. (this distro also did not even see my 1GB swap space 
on my HD??)</p> 
<p><strong>Linux Mint 12 Gnome</strong></p> 
<p>To show you what a current, standard distro uses we have included the 
latest Mint distro. As you can see it is running just past Crunchbang at 869 MB 
of RAM.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As you can see, the alternate Window Manager distros really do start with a 
lower system memory footprint, however that isn&rsquo;t always the case we 
discovered by looking at Crunchbang.</p>

<h2>Linux Mint KDE &ndash; Is This a Good KDE Distribution?</h2>  Sunday, 
December 25th, 2011 |Learn Linux - Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Robert Fanning</p> 
<p>Linux Mint KDE is another quality KDE distribution that you can choose 
from. It&rsquo;s actually based on Ubuntu which will still give you access to 
those repositories giving you easy access to installing software that you need. 
It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a community edition meaning that volunteers 
actually put this distribution together. Generally it&rsquo;s a version behind 
the main version of Mint but still has everything you need.</p> 
<p>Linux Mint KDE has a basic desktop that is already customized. It&rsquo;s 
comes with a fresh blue look to it with the default KDE grey title bars. 
It&rsquo;s set up quite a bit like Windows with the &ldquo;start&rdquo; button 
the bottom left, a basic taskbar, notification icons, and a clock. It&rsquo;s 
your standard KDE layout for those who know what this look like.</p> 
<p>It uses the new KDE 4 with the plasma desktop. If you are using the KDE 
edition of Mint, then you probably love the new plasma and don&rsquo;t mind the 
extra resources that this uses over the old KDE 3. There are many who are split 
on the differences between the two but users have gradually accepted version 
four&rsquo;s changes.</p> 
<p>Some wonder why to use Mint&rsquo;s KDE edition over something like Kubuntu 
since both are based on Ubuntu. Linux Mint comes with proprietary drivers 
installed to play music, dvd, flash, and java. These do not have to be 
installed by you at all unlike Kubuntu. By default it also uses Firefox and 
Thunderbird instead of the traditional KDE browser and mail programs. Mint also 
has some features like MintInstall and MintUpdate. These will help you get new 
applications installed and updated really easily.</p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the KDE edition, there are also Fluxbox, XFCE, and 
Gnome editions of Mint to try out as well as other distributions that use KDE.

<h2>Linux Mint 8 Fluxbox Edition &ndash; A Low Power Modern Linux Desktop</h2> 
 Saturday, December 24th, 2011 |Learn Linux - Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>
<p>By Richard Hove</p> 
<p>One huge advantage of Linux is it&rsquo;s flexibility. Different pieces of 
open source software can be put together in order to make it work on certain 
types of hardware. One graphical user interface that is good for older hardware 
is Fluxbox. Ituses so little resources that even a machine that is nearly 10 
years old can run it well. The problem is that very few distributions actually 
have a Fluxbox edition. Linux Mint 8 has now come out with their Fluxbox 
edition meaning it&rsquo;s one of the most modern and up to date versions of 
Linux that is using Fluxbox.</p> 
<p>Linux Mint is a distribution that is based on Ubuntu. There are a few 
differences. First, it looks better than Ubuntu. Instead of the brown and 
orange colors, it uses greens and blacks to create a pretty slick looking 
desktop. It also comes with proprietary plugins already installed like Flash 
and Java as well as the codex that you will need to play certain music formats 
on your computer. While you can install these manually with Ubuntu, Mint has it 
done when you install the distribution.</p> 
<p>Fluxbox can be added onto any Linux distribution. The problem is that you 
will have to configure it to work well. While this can be done by expert users, 
newer users have a hard time knowing all the pieces that you will need to make 
it work properly. Linux Mint 8 Fluxbox has all this already done for you 
setting it up so that everything works that way you need it to.</p> 
<p>While it is made for older hardware, you might not be a huge fan of 
interfaces like Gnome and KDE. Fluxbox and XFCE are some popular alternatives 
to these. The advantage of Fluxbox is that it&rsquo;s so simple that it 
doesn&rsquo;t get in the way like other interfaces tend to do. You can use this 
edition even on a high power machine if that is something you want.</p>

dehydrator of which he is a big fan. He uses the Excalibur 2900 dehydrator.

<h2>Using Graphic Interfaces to Control Unix Operating Systems</h2>  
Wednesday, December 21st, 2011 |Learn Linux - Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>
<p>By David Childers</p> 
<p>The use of the text based command line for running applications or 
configuring computer systems can be a daunting task. Special commands must be 
used which may require additional modifiers to invoke the desired computer 
function. Both Desktop Environments and Windows Mangers provide a graphical 
method for users to control and configure a Unix operating system, without the 
need for using text based command line control. Graphical user interfaces 
eliminate the tedious memorization of text based commands.</p> 
<p>Desktop environments are graphic interfaces that provide user control and 
configuration of a computer operating system in addition to installed 
applications. The graphic interface generally consist of menus, icons and 
background desktop images. It also allows users to manipulate items with the 
drag and drop function or use the point and click function to execute 
applications on the desktop itself.</p> 
<p>The following are Open Source / Free Desktop Environment packages for the 
Unix operating systems. (Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris)</p> 
<p>These desktop environments provide users with the ability to utilize 
software developed with various computer languages, and the ability to utilize 
the software on different computer hardware configurations.</p> 
<p>KDE is based on the Qt 4 programming language and allows applications to be 
integrated within the desktop. KDE uses the KWin window manager.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>GNOME is based on the GTK+ programming language and allows applications to 
be integrated within the desktop. Gnome uses the Metacity window manager.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>XFCE is based on the the GTK+ programming language. Xfce uses the Xfwm 
window manager.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
LXDE does not have applications integrated into the desktop. 
LXDE uses the Openbox window manager.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The X window manager is an application that controls the function of the X 
Window System. It can be configured to manage the visual appearance of display 
windows and control panels. The X window manager also controls how users 
interact with these graphical interfaces.</p> 
<p>The X Window System provides the system resources and software components 
necessary for the creation of graphical user interfaces (Windows Managers and 
Desktop Environments).</p> 
<p>The following are the most common Open Source / Free Window Manager 
packages for the Unix operating systems : Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and 
Solaris.</p> 
<p>These window managers provide users with the ability to utilize the 
software on different computer hardware configurations and provide various 
visual appearance.</p> 
<p>- Blackbox is written in C++. It offers support for multiple workspaces.</p>
<p>- Fluxbox is based on Blackbox 0.61.1. It offers minimal support for 
graphical icons.</p> 
<p>- Openbox was originally based on Blackbox 0.65.0. It allows users to 
utilize applications without a full desktop environment installed.</p> 
<p>- Enlightenment can be used as a substitute for a complete desktop 
environment.</p> 
<p>- IceWM was written in C++. It can be configured to recreate the visual 
appearance of various desktop environments.</p> 
<p>- Window Maker provides drag and drop user control in addition to 
supporting multiple workspaces.</p> 
<p>- Sawfish is written with a scripting language that is similar to Lisp. It 
provides very basic features.</p> 
<p>- Metacity is written in GTK+. It was created for use with the Gnome 
Desktop Environment.</p> 
<p>- MWM is based on the Motif toolkit. It does not support desktop icons or 
multiple workspaces.</p> 
<p>- FVWM is based on TWM. It provides the ability to display a 3D 
visualization ( similar to MWM ) and supports basic multiple workspace.</p> 
<p>- AfterStep was originally based on FVWM and was designed to provide a 
NextStep themed appearance.</p> 
<p>- CTWM is based on TWM. It provides rudimentary GNOME desktop support and 
multiple workspaces.</p> 
<p>Text based command line configuration and control can provide a 
comprehensive method for daily computer management and operation. 
Unfortunately, users are required to know the necessary unique commands and 
their unique structure that must be used. Graphical user interfaces alleviate 
that requirement and make the use of a computer both simple and effective.</p>

<h2>Differences Between Linux And Windows</h2>  Friday, November 27th, 2009 |

<p>Differences Between Linux And Windows<br>
 By Matt Gebhardt</p> 
<p>This article will discuss the differences between the Linux and Windows 
operating software; we discuss some of the pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s of each 
system.</p> 
<p>Let us first start out with a general overview of the Linux operating 
system. Linux at its most basic form is a computer kernel. The Kernel is the 
underlying computer code, used to communicate with hardware, and other system 
software, it also runs all of the basic functions of the computer.</p> 
<p>The Linux Kernel is an operating system, which runs on a wide variety of 
hardware and for a variety of purposes. Linux is capable of running on devices 
as simple as a wrist watch, or a cell phone, but it can also run on a home 
computer using, for example Intel, or AMD processors, and its even capable of 
running on high end servers using Sun Sparc CPU&rsquo;s or IBM power PC 
processors. Some Linux distro&rsquo;s can only run one processor, while others 
can run many at once.</p> 
<p>Increase your profit with an efficient Dedicated Server Hosting from one of 
the leading agencies.</p> 
<p>Common uses for Linux include that of a home desktop computing system, or 
more commonly for a server application, such as use as a web server, or mail 
server. You can even use Linux as a dedicated firewall to help protect other 
machines that are on the same network.</p> 
<p>A programmer student named Linus Torvalds first made Linux as a variant of 
the Unix operating system in 1991. Linus Torvalds made Linux open source with 
the GNU (GPL) (General Public License), so other programmers could download the 
source code free of charge and alter it any way they see fit. Thousands of 
coders throughout the world began downloading and altering the source code of 
Linux, applying patches, and bug fixes, and other improvements, to make the OS 
better and better. Over the years Linux has gone from a simple text based clone 
of Unix, to a powerful operating software, with full-featured desktop 
environments, and unprecedented portability, and a variety of uses. Most of the 
original Unix code has also been gradually written out of Linux over the years.
</p> 
<p>As a result of Linux being open source software, there is no one version of 
Linux; instead there are many different versions or distributions of Linux, 
that are suited for a variety of different users and task. Some Distributions 
of Linux include Gentoo, and Slackware, which due to the lack of a complete 
graphical environment is best, suited for Linux experts, programmers, and other 
users that know their way around a command prompt. Distributions that lack a 
graphical environment are best suited for older computers lacking the 
processing power necessary to process graphics, or for computers performing 
processor intensive task, where it is desirable to have all of the system 
resources focused on the task at hand, rather than wasting resources by 
processing graphics. Other Linux distributions aim at making the computing 
experience as easy as possible. Distributions such as Ubuntu, or Linspire make 
Linux far easier to use, by offering full-featured graphical environments that 
help eliminate the need for a command prompt. Of course the downside of ease of 
use is less configurability, and wasted system resources on graphics 
processing. Other distributions such as Suse try to find a common ground 
between ease of use and configurability.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Linux has two parts, they include the Kernel mentioned previously, 
and in most circumstances it will also include a graphical user interface, 
which runs atop the Kernel&rdquo; reference #3. In most cases the user will 
communicate with the computer via the graphical user interface. (ref #6) Some 
of the more common graphical environments that can run on Linux include the 
following. The KDE GUI (Graphical user interface). Matthias Ettrich developed 
KDE in 1996. He wanted a GUI for the Unix desktop that would make all of the 
applications look and feel alike. He also wanted a desktop environment for Unix 
that would be easier to use than the ones available at the time. KDE is a free 
open source project, with millions of coders working on it throughout the 
world, but it also has some commercial support from companies such as Novell, 
Troltech, and Mandriva. KDE aims to make an easy to use desktop environment 
without sacrificing configurability. Windows users might note that KDE has a 
similar look to Windows. Another popular GUI is (ref #7) GNOME. GNOME puts a 
heavy emphasis on simplicity, and user ability. Much like KDE GNOME is open 
source and is free to download. One notable feature of GNOME is the fact that 
it supports many different languages; GNOME supports over 100 different 
languages. Gnome is license under the LGPL license (lesser general public 
license). The license allows applications written for GNOME to use a much wider 
set of licenses, including some commercial applications. The name GNOME stands 
for GNU Network object model environment. GNOME&rsquo;s look and feel is 
similar to that of other desktop environments. Fluxbox is another example of a 
Linux GUI. With less of an emphasis on ease of use and eye candy, Fluxbox aims 
to be a very lightweight, and a more efficient user of system resources. The 
interface has only a taskbar and a menu bar, which is accessed by right 
clicking over the desktop. Fluxbox is most popular for use with older computers 
that have a limited abundance of system resources.</p> 
<p>Although most Linux distributions offer a graphical environment, to 
simplify the user experience, they all also offer a way for more technically 
involved users to directly communicate with the Kernel via a shell or command 
line. The command line allows you to run the computer without a GUI, by 
executing commands from a text-based interface. An advantage of using the 
command prompt is it uses less system resources and enables your computer to 
focus more of its energy on the task at hand. Examples of commands include the 
cd command for changing your directory, or the halt command for shutting down 
your system, or the reboot command for restarting the computer ect.</p> 
<p>Now that we are more familiar with the Linux operating system, we can note 
the many ways in which Linux differs from the worlds most popular OS, Microsoft 
Windows. From this point forward we will discuss some of the more prominent 
ways in which Linux deferrers from Windows.</p> 
<p>For starters there is only one company that releases a Windows operating 
system, and that company is Microsoft. All versions of Windows, weather Windows 
XP Home, Business, or Vista, all updates, security patches, and service patches 
for Windows comes from Microsoft. With Linux on the other hand there is not one 
company that releases it. Linux has millions of coders and companies throughout 
the world, volunteering their time to work on patches, updates, newer versions, 
and software applications. Although some companies, charge for TECH support, 
and others charge for their distribution of Linux, by packaging it with 
non-free software, you will always be able to get the Linux Kernel for free, 
and you can get full-featured Linux desktops with all the necessary 
applications for general use, for free as well. The vendors that charge money 
for their distribution of Linux are also required to release a free version in 
order to comply with the GPL License agreement. With Microsoft Windows on the 
other hand you have to pay Microsoft for the software, and you will also have 
to pay for most of the applications that you will use.</p> 
<p>Windows and Linux also differ on TECH support issues. Windows is backed by 
the Microsoft Corporation, which means that if you have an issue with any of 
their products the company should resolve it. For example if Microsoft Windows 
is not working right, then you should be able to call Microsoft and make use of 
their TECH support to fix the issue. TECH support is usually included with the 
purchase of the product for a certain amount of time, maybe a two year period, 
and from there on you may be charged for the service. Although IBM backs their 
Linux products, for the most part if you use Linux you are on your own. If you 
have a problem with Ubuntu Linux you cannot call Ubuntu and expect any help. 
Despite the lack of professional help, you can however receive good TECH 
advice, from the thousands or millions of Linux forums that are on the web. You 
ca also get great help from social networking sites such as Myspace, by posting 
questions in the many Linux groups. You can usually receive responses for your 
questions in a matter of hours form many qualified people.</p> 
<p>Configurability is another key difference between the two operating 
software&rsquo;s. Although Windows offers its control panel to help users 
configure the computer to their liking, it does not match the configuring 
options that Linux provides especially if you are a real TECH savvy user. In 
Linux the Kernel is open source, so if you have the know how, you can modify it 
in virtually any way that you see fit. Also Linux offers a variety of Graphical 
environments to further suit your needs. As mentioned earlier Linux is capable 
of running full-featured graphical environments like KDE, or more lightweight 
and resource friendly GUI&rsquo;s like Fluxbox, or Blackbox, to suit users with 
older computers. There are also versions of Linux that are designed to emulate 
the Windows look and feel as closely as possible. Distributions such as 
Linspire are best suited for users that are migrating over from the Windows 
world. There are also distributions that include no graphical environment at 
all to better suit users that need to squeeze out all of the computing power 
that they can get for various computing activities, and for users that are more 
advanced than others. All of this configurability can be problematic sometimes, 
as you will have to make a decision on which desktop is right for you, and to 
make things easier on yourself you will need to only install applications that 
are native to your distribution and graphical environment.</p> 
<p>(ref #1) The cost effectiveness of Linux is another way it separates itself 
from Windows. For home use Linux is cheap and in most cases completely free, 
while Windows varies in cost depending on which version you buy. With Linux 
most of the applications will also be free, however for Windows in the majority 
of cases you are suppose to pay for the applications. For most cases, with 
Linux there is no need to enter a product activation key when performing an 
installation, you are free to install it on as many computers as you&rsquo;d 
like. With Windows you are only allowed to install it on one computer and 
Microsoft uses product activation software to enforce this rule. When 
installing Window&rsquo;s you must enter a product activation key, which will 
expire after so many uses. If you wish too, you can purchase Linux from a 
variety of vendors, which will include a boxed set of CDs, Manuals, and TECH 
support for around 40-130$. Of course If you purchase a high-end version of 
Linux used for servers it may cost any where from 400$- 2000$. &ldquo;In 2002 
computer world magazine quoted the chief technology architect at Merrill Lynch 
in New York, as saying &ldquo;the cost of running Linux is typically a tenth of 
the cost of running Unix or Windows alternatively.&rdquo; (ref#1)</p> 
<p>(ref #1) Installation of Windows is generally easier, than installing 
Linux. &ldquo;With Windows XP there are three main ways to install. There is a 
clean install, in which you install Windows on a blank hard drive. There is 
also an upgrade install, in which you start with an older version of Windows 
and &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to a newer one. An advantage of upgrading is that all 
of the files on the older system should remain intact throughout the process. 
You can also perform a repair install, in which case you are installing the 
same version of Windows on top of itself in order to fix a damaged version of 
Windows. There is also a recovery, which Technically is not an install; it is 
used to restore a copy of Windows back to its factory settings. The 
disadvantage of recovering Windows is the fact that you will loose all of your 
data, which resides on the damaged copy of Windows.&rdquo; (ref#1) Also with 
Windows you can rest assured that your hardware will most likely be supported 
by the operating software, although this is not much of a problem with Linux 
you cant be sure if Linux will support all of your hardware. With Linux 
installation varies greatly from Distro to Distro. You may be presented with a 
graphical installer or it may be a text-based installer, these variations make 
Linux a bit more difficult and unpredictable to install than is Windows, 
(although the difficulty is disappearing). You may perform a clean install of 
Linux or dual boot it, to co-exist with another operation software. With Linux 
rather than having to buy an upgrade Cd, you can install updates by downloading 
and then installing them while your desktop is running. With Linux it is also 
not necessary to reboot your computer after most upgrades, It is only necessary 
to reboot after an upgrade to the kernel. It is also possible to run Linux 
without ever needing to install it on a hard drive; there are many 
distributions of Linux that will allow you to run it straight off of a live cd. 
The advantage of this is that you do not need to alter your system in order to 
try Linux. You can run Linux off of the CD so you do not have to damage your 
Windows partition. Other advantages include the ability to rescue a broken 
Linux system. If your Linux computer will not boot, then you may insert a live 
cd and boot off it, so you can repair the damaged version of Linux. Also you 
may use a Linux live cd to recover files from a damaged Windows computer that 
will no longer boot up. Since Linux is capable of reading NTFS files you may 
copy files form a Windows computer to a USB flash drive or floppy drive etc.</p>
<p>Another major difference between Linux and Windows is the applications that 
you will use with either OS. Windows includes a much wider abundance of 
commercially backed applications than does Linux. It is much easier to find the 
software that you are looking for with Windows than it is with Linux, because 
so many software vendors make their products compatible with Windows only. With 
Linux you will for the most part be forced to let go of the familiar 
applications that you have grown accustomed to with Windows, in favor of 
lesser-known open source apps that are made for Linux. Applications such as 
Microsoft office, Outlook, Internet Explorer, Adobe Creative suite, and chat 
clients such as MSN messenger, do not work natively with Linux. Although with 
Linux you can get Microsoft office and Adobe creative suite to work using 
software from codeWeavers called cross Over Office. Instead of using these 
applications you will need to use Linux apps such as open office, The Gimp 
Image Editor, The ThunderBird email client, Instead of the MSN messenger you 
can use the GAIM messenger, and you can use Firefox as your web browser. Also 
with Linux it can be difficult to install software even if it is made for 
Linux. This is due to the fact that Linux has so many different versions. 
Software that is made to install on one version probably will require some 
configuration in order to install on another version. An example would be if 
you were trying to install software that was made for the KDE graphical 
environment, on the GNOME GUI, This app would not easily install on the GNOME 
GUI, and would require some configuring on your part to successfully install it.
</p> 
<p>The type of hard ware that Linux and windows runs on also causes them to 
differ. Linux will run on many different hardware platforms, from Intel and AMD 
chips, to computers running IBM power Pc processors. Linux will run on the 
slowest 386 machines to the biggest mainframes on the planet, newer versions of 
Windows will not run on the same amount of hardware as Linux. Linux can even be 
configured to run on apples, Ipod&rsquo;s, or smart phones. A disadvantage of 
Linux is when it comes to using hardware devices such as Printers, Scanners, or 
Digital camera&rsquo;s. Where as the driver software for these devices will 
often be easily available for Windows, with Linux you are for the most part 
left on your own to find drivers for these devices. Most Linux users will find 
comfort in the fact that drivers for the latest hardware are constantly being 
written by coders throughout the world and are usually very quickly made 
available.</p> 
<p>(ref #1) One of the most notable differences between the two operating 
software&rsquo;s is Windows legendary problems with malicious code, known as 
Viruses and Spy ware. Viruses, Spy-ware and a general lack of security are the 
biggest problems facing the Windows community. Under Windows Viruses and 
Spy-ware have the ability to execute themselves with little or no input from 
the user. This makes guarding against them a constant concern for any Windows 
user. Windows users are forced to employ third party anti virus software to 
help limit the possibility of the computer being rendered useless by malicious 
code. Anti virus software often has the negative side effect of hogging system 
resources, thus slowing down your entire computer, also most anti virus 
software requires that you pay a subscription service, and that you constantly 
download updates in order to stay ahead of the intruders. With Linux on the 
other hand problems with viruses are practically non-existent, and in reality 
you do not even need virus protection for your Linux machine. One reason why 
Viruses and Spy-ware are not a problem for Linux is simply due to the fact that 
there are far fewer being made for Linux. A more important reason is that 
running a virus on a Linux machine is more difficult and requires a lot more 
input from the user. With Windows you may accidentally run and execute a virus, 
by opening an email attachment, or by double clicking on a file that contains 
malicious code. However with Linux a virus would need to run in the terminal, 
which requires the user to give the file execute permissions, and then open it 
in the terminal. And in order to cause any real damage to the system the user 
would have to log in as root, by typing a user name and password before running 
the virus. Foe example to run a virus that is embedded in an email attachment 
the user would have to, open the attachment, then save it, then right click the 
file and chose properties form the menu, in properties they can give it execute 
permissions, they would then be able to open the file in the terminal to run 
the virus. And even then the user would only be able to damage his or her home 
folder, all other users data will be left untouched, and all root system files 
would also remain untouched, because Linux would require a root password to 
make changes to these files. The only way the user can damage the whole 
computer would be if he or she logged in as root user by providing the root 
user name and password to the terminal before running the virus. Unlike Windows 
in Linux an executable file cannot run automatically, It needs to be given 
execute permissions manually this significantly improves security. In Linux the 
only realistic reason you would need virus protection is if you share files 
with Windows users, and that is to protect them not you, so you are not to 
accidentally pass a virus to the Windows computer that you are sharing files 
with.</p> 
<p>The above was a general over view of some differences between the Windows 
operating system, and Linux. To recap we started with the fact that Windows has 
only one vendor that releases the software, while Linux comes from millions of 
different coders throughout the world. We also commented on the fact that the 
Linux Kernel and much of the applications used with it are completely free of 
charge, where as with windows you are forced to pay for most of the software. 
Unlike Widows Linux is often lacking in professional Tech support, and Linux 
users are often left on their own to solve Technical issues. Linux users can 
either pay for Tech support or rely on the many Linux Forums and groups 
available on the Internet. Due to the fact that the kernel is open source, 
Linux has a huge advantage over Windows in configurability. You can configure 
Linux to run almost any way you see fit by manipulating the Kernel. Installing 
the Windows Operating software and applications is easier due to the fact that 
it has a universal installer. Also finding applications for Windows is easier 
because of its popularity most apps are available for Windows only, and are 
made easily available. Linux will run on a greater variety of hard ware than 
does Windows, from mainframe super computers running multiple IBM Power PC 
Chips, to a small laptop running an AMD processor. And of course the biggest 
difference in this writer&rsquo;s opinion is the fact that Linux does not 
suffer from an onslaught of Viruses and other malicious code, unlike Windows 
which is plagued by countless number of malicious code that can easily destroy 
your system if not properly guarded against.</p> 
<p>In conclusion we will conclude that the Linux OS really is the superior 
software. Other than a few minor nuisances, linux out performs Windows in most 
categories. The fact that Linux is more secure is the tipping point, that tilts 
the scales in the favor of Linux. Windows simply suffers from far to many 
security vulnerabilities for it to be considered the better over all desktop 
environment.</p>

<h2>Running Linux on an old notebook</h2>  Tuesday, May 19th, 2009 | Arizona 
Linux | 3 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>I am currently trying to find the best live Linux CD for an old notebook 
computer I have, a Compaq Presario 1700 XL260. This computer has a 500 MHz 
Pentium III processor, 192 MB of RAM, and over 5 GB of hard drive space. It 
looks like it also has a DVD-ROM, two USB ports &ndash;One currently used by my 
mouse, the other buy either a USB memory stick, or a USB wi-fi adapter.<br>
<br>
 Initially I tried to get the PC working with a Linux distro that would allow 
me to get online wirelessly with my router using that USB wireless-G adapter 
mentioned earlier. I was pretty sure that I&rsquo;d have to use a lightweight 
distro since the dearth of RAM would be probably the biggest limiter in my 
distro selection choices.<br>
<br>
<br>
 My first try was with &hellip;. DSL 
&mdash; Damn Small Linux.Weighing in at 50MB, the highly-regarded, extremely 
light weight distribution proved to live up to its billing, however it 
certainly wasn&rsquo;t as user friendly as I would have liked. It comes with 
JWM and Fluxbox, no Gnome, or KDE with this one, obviously. One big problem I 
encountered with this version as I occasionally did with subsequent ones is 
that getting Linux to talk to a USB wi-fi adapter is much tougher than I would 
suspect a PCI wi-fi adapter. Not to mention I&rsquo;m sure all distros will 
connect to a network with no problem these days using a hard-wired ethernet.</p>
<p>My next Linux distro to try was Puppy Linux, the 100MB powerhouse. This was 
truly an exciting version to use since it had so many advanced elements for 
such a small size that it really seemed like that could be a daily user that 
could keep up with the big fellas in the Linux world.It was really fast, too, 
since it booted itself entirely into the minuscule RAM on the computer! The 
distro ships with JWM / IceWM + ROX Desktop user interfaces for your 
convenience. So, it&rsquo;s still a small distro but it has more modern desktop 
environments than the previously mentioned DSL.</p> 
<p>I eventually tested around a dozen distros, and understandably the more 
&ldquo;packed-with-features&rdquo; distros like the Ubuntus and the Arch Linux 
types were really too much for the mature system. Unfortunately since the 
system doesn&rsquo;t have an ethernet port, it really limits the functionality 
of the networking aspect.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly true that there are some modern albeit light-weight 
distros out there today that can certainly bring life back to this baby. It 
still has Windows 98se installed on its hard drive, and I certainly 
wouldn&rsquo;t consider trying XP but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun looking at the 
latest in mini-Linux and seeing what this machine is still capable of.</p>
