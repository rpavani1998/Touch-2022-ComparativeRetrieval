<h1>What Comes After the Windows Era?</h1> <br>
 Aug 15, 2008 &nbsp;By&nbsp; 
Glyn Moody <br>
<br>

<p>As a computer journalist for the last 25 years, I've received a lot of 
review copies of software. As something of an obsessive magpie, I've tended to 
keep most of it, &ldquo;for reference&rdquo;. Until yesterday, that is, when I 
finally threw out all those copies of OS/2, Lotus SmartSuite, and my entire 
collection of Microsoft software. This included Windows NT 3.5, Windows 2000, 
Microsoft Office and many, many more. What's makes this little spring-cleaning 
exercise particularly apt as well as cathartic is that all of us - and not just 
me - may finally be witnessing the end of the Windows era.</p> 
<p>The most obvious manifestation of this has been the utter fiasco that is 
Vista. This is not so much things like the recentsecurity hole in Vista's 
memory protection, which may ormay not be a big deal &ndash; although if Bruce 
Schneiersees it as a real problem, then I think Microsoft's probably in 
trouble. No, it's the fact that however Microsoft tries to spin the numbers, 
Vista is simply not catching on. The company can try all themarketing tricks it 
likes, but customers are voting with their wallets byopting for the 
&ldquo;downgrade&rdquo; to XP:</p> 
<p>An official at PC maker Hewlett-Packard said the majority of the company's 
business customers are downgrading new computers from Windows Vista to Windows 
XP -- raising questions about Microsoft's Vista sales figures. </p> 
<p>Another tell-tale sign that the days of Windows as we know it are drawing 
to a close are the increasing number of stories aboutMidori:</p> 
<p>Microsoft is incubating a componentized non-Windows operating system known 
as Midori, which is being architected from the ground up to tackle challenges 
that Redmond has determined cannot be met by simply evolving its existing 
technology. </p> 
<p>SD Times has viewed internal Microsoft documents that outline 
Midori&rsquo;s proposed design, which is Internet-centric and predicated on the 
prevalence of connected systems. </p> 
<p>Midori is an offshoot of Microsoft Research&rsquo;s Singularity operating 
system, the tools and libraries of which are completely managed code. Midori is 
designed to run directly on native hardware (x86, x64 and ARM), be hosted on 
the Windows Hyper-V hypervisor, or even be hosted by a Windows process.</p> 
<p>That is, we may be looking at a complete dicontinuity in the Windows line 
&ndash; a recognition that the creaking software architecture that has been 
around for over a decade now is simply too broken to be fixed.</p> 
<p>There are a number of straws in the wind indicating that Windows no longer 
provides the benchmark for desktop computing. The continuing rise in popularity 
of Apple's machines is a clear indication that more people are looking beyond 
Microsoft, something that was reflected in Mark Shuttleworth's recentexhortation
 to the free software community:</p> 
<p>&quot;The great task in front of us over the next two years is to lift the 
experience of the Linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and 
not so pretty, into something that is art,&quot; Shuttleworth said to applause 
from the audience. &quot;Can we not only emulate, but can we blow right past 
Apple?&quot;</p> 
<p>Quite correctly, Shuttleworth sees Apple as the one to beat these days.</p> 
<p>The traditional desktop experience is being further redefined through the 
move to cloud computing solutions, which are frequently browser-based, and the 
appearance of GNU/Linux-based ultraportables, which also draw on Net-based 
solutions for much of their convenience. Both make the underlying operating 
system moot.</p> 
<p>And as if that weren't enough, there's yet another interesting approach 
that could have a substantial impact on people's perception of free software 
&ndash; and of Windows. TheSplashtop technology uses GNU/Linux as a kind of 
pre-operating system that lets users boot up very quickly to gain Internet 
access and perform key tasks such as checking email or moving around the Web. 
Strikingly, some of Splashtop's keyadvantages are essentially reactions to two 
of Windows' problems &ndash; speed and security:</p> 
<p>Be online seconds after you turn on your PC. Why wait for Windows to load 
when you could be surfing the web right away!</p> 
<p>Surf the Web safely, immune from the malware that targets Windows.</p> 
<p>What started out as a cool, but rather marginal, idea has now started gain 
momentum. First, it was announced thatAsus motherboards would be offering the 
feature, and thenAsus notebooks. In a sure sign that the approach is entering 
the mainstream, now Dell hasjoined the club:</p> 
<p>Dell&rsquo;s Latitude On works by bypassing the Windows operating system so 
that you get immediate access to things like your calendar, email, Internet, 
and contacts. It&rsquo;s a fully integrated technology that will appear later 
this year on the Dell 4200 and 4300 Latitude series notebooks, and is powered 
by a Linux OS, sort of as a secondary operating system.</p> 
<p>What this means is that users of these systems, even when rigorously 
Windows-based, will be experiencing the power and speed of GNU/Linux, albeit 
unwittingly, when they use this mode. Even if they don't know it's GNU/Linux, 
they will certainly be aware that it is not Windows. Moreover, if the idea 
proves popular, it's not hard to imagine most PC manufacturers following suit 
in order to match Dell's move, ensuring that many more people experience the 
fact that it is possible to use a PC without using Windows.</p> 
<p>That is the key breakthrough. At the moment, there is a widespread if tacit 
assumption that desktop computing *is* Windows. This is manifest most clearly 
in schools, where teaching computing really means teaching children how to use 
Windows and Office. Once people realise they have a choice, then Windows' 
stranglehold on the desktop market will be fatally loosened.</p> 
<p>For many years, people in the free software world have dreamed of a day 
when GNU/Linux would replace Windows on the desktop. Although the market share 
of GNU/Linux there is finally lifting &ndash; figuresrange from 3% to 11%, 
according to the sector &ndash; it seems unlikely that GNU/Linux will ever take 
over the desktop from Windows. But that does not mean that Windows will 
maintain its dominance there, simply that the future is more complex than the 
monoculture we have seen and suffered for nearly two decades.</p> 
<p>I would like to suggest that the free software world should start looking 
at things from a different perspective &ndash; not how many percentage points 
GNU/Linux gains on the desktop, but how many Microsoft is losing to *all* of 
the alternatives to Windows. Free software has nothing to fear from a 
heterogeneous environment &ndash; indeed, mixing technologies almost forces 
open standards upon manufacturers if they want to provide full interoperability.
</p> 
<p>Moreover, as many have pointed out, the low number of GNU/Linux viruses is 
only in part down to the latter's superior design. If GNU/Linux became as 
dominant on the desktop as Windows, there would be a greater incentive to break 
that security &ndash; and a bigger knock-on effect when it was broken. Far 
better to promote heterogeneity, which is good for the software ecosystem, and 
thus good for *all* users.</p> 
<p>Against this background, then, we should be celebrating what looks 
increasingly like the end of the Windows era on the desktop, but not in the 
na&iuml;ve, and slightly selfish hope that it will usher in one purely based on 
GNU/Linux. One of the best proofs that free software is superior in all senses 
to proprietary software is having the maturity to recognise that the world of 
personal computing today is far more complicated, and far richer, than Bill 
Gates's original, monopolistic vision of &ldquo;a (Microsoft-based) computer on 
every desktop&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Nice article. Thank you. Matter is that I'm depressed about Linux for its 
unhappy and ill looking Graphical Interface especially like gnome, new KDE. 
There's something not spontaneous like Windows. Can anyone tell how can we make 
Linux more elegant, more friendly in both Textual and Graphical Interface..</p> 
<p>By the way, sorry for out topics..</p>

<h3> overlooked GNU/ prefix opportunity </h3> <br>
 Submitted by mario (not 
verified) on Tue, 08/19/2008 - 16:21. 
<p>Hey, Glyn. Nice article. I very much like your unobtrusive attention to 
details. There is however one occurence of the word &quot;Linux&quot; which you 
forgot to prefix with the GNU/ reminder.<br>
 For example when citing people, 
you can correct the wording if you place the fixes into square brackets. So 
with the Shuttleworth comment, you could have written: &quot;...... lift the 
experience of the<strong>[GNU/]</strong>Linux desktop from ......&quot;</p>

<p>This is what my inner RMS wanted me to do, but equally it would have been 
slightly disrepectful to Mr Shuttleworth to be putting in that implicit 
square-bracketed criticism.... What's a chap to do?</p> <br>

<h3> Microsoft Declining, Cloud to Remain Flat </h3> <br>
 Submitted by JohnMc

<p>Guy,</p> 
<p>I think your observations are reasonable. Especially the note that the 
desktop space is MS's to lose which seems to be the case. I don't think it 
unreasonable over a 5-10 period to see Linux acceptance at the 25% mark as a 
portion of market share.</p> 
<p>Where I might have a quibble is the expectation of the cloud being a bigger 
player. Couple of factors are in the way --</p> 
<p>1) Tech is very democratic price wise. The price I pay at Frys for a hard 
drive off the shelf is not that much different from what Amazon pays for those 
drives by the box load. Run the numbers and you see 3-4 months of S3 for 
storage and you have paid for the cost of the drive onsite.</p> 
<p>2) Broadband is not where it should be at a bandwidth/pricepoint to make 
the cloud price competive for a replacement of the OS. The only service of any 
significance is FIOS and its not sufficiently deployed nationally.</p> 
<p>The cloud will continue to play a role but it will be limited to certain 
situations -</p> 
<p>A) Offsite storage where the costs are less than say a physical service 
like Iron Mountain.<br>
 B) Certain services where the need is not consistent 
and the customer pays by the dip.<br>
 C) Company has capital constraints on IT 
acquisitions that can be differed as a expense stream using a similar service 
online.</p> 
<p>That is about where we are right now in the online space. I would not be 
surprised to see that usage change till we see massive changes in price 
structures of data transport.</p> 
<p>Linux still gains regardless.</p> 
<h3> Good Article! </h3> <br>
 Submitted by FredR on Sat, 08/16/2008 - 17:43. 
<br> 
<p>I wholeheartedly agree. I always like to read your writings. I find myself 
just nodding my head in agreement, as if you're putting into words many ideas a 
lot of us already know for fact.</p> 
<p>I'd like to extend a bit on what you mentioned. The Windows Monoculture. 
I've noticed a paradigm out there and people are happy to live within the 
little bubble. They're intimidated by technology in general, and they believe 
Windows makes things easy enough for them to cope.</p> 
<p>In fact, when I left my last job (an MS Gold Partner) part of it was due to 
the fact that I consider myself a &quot;Linux Guy&quot;. The president actually 
said to me &quot;well, I can't change the entire paradigm&quot;. I felt like 
telling him to look outside the box he's put himself in.</p> 
<p>I didn't grow up entirely inside the Windows bubble. I grew up around it, 
with technology and cut my teeth on so many different things, Windows was one 
tool in the toolbox. I decided I preferred Linux and it's corresponding tools 
because they were just better. And they were there, available, with a low 
barrier to entry.</p> 
<p>Don't get me wrong ... I own some Windows clients and am rather adept at 
using them. But I look forward to the day that the idea which takes majority is 
the best technical solution from the opinions of software developers and 
engineers, not marketing based on what the masses will find &quot;easy&quot; 
because of their comfort level with technology.</p>

<p>Oh man! I didn't know there was gonna be a quiz! You know I've studied for 
this question for a long time. Ah, let me see...</p> 
<p>(Insert expectant pause here)</p> 
<p>What comes after the winDOHs earache ...er, urea ...ah, error ...ire?!</p> 
<p>Improved computing security? Stable operating systems? Software 
applications that actually work with interfaces that make sense? Lower costs to 
business re software and hardware? Fewer computers going into landfills? A 
bunch of m$ trolls going on unemployment? Steve Ballmer opens a 'pre-owned 
furniture' store with chairs that have been thrown only once? Steve Ballmer 
becomes the spokesman for the Hair Club for Men? A sudden influx into the job 
market of one-time spammers?</p> 
<p>Oh. I know. All those 'Life Coaches' suddenly have an increase of clientele 
from all those winDOHs people with MCSE certs.</p>

<p>keep dreaming boys<br>
 linux will NEVER move beyond linux type ppl unless 
linus exercises some power among developers - hippie mentality does not play 
with businesses and general population<br>
 linux software programs are too 
buggy, not much tested before releasing final versions and program version is 
just a joke - developer writes 2 line code that does not work at all and calls 
it version 1.1<br>
 my experience - tried to substitute ms word with open 
office (i write books) - does not work - oowriter is a joke for any serious job
<br> linus needs to do some spring cleaning among developers (here i think 
mostly abt program version number) and allow some commercial opportunity 
otherwise there will be no significant move in linux market share - it is 
simply not good enough for general population and businesses<br>

<p>If you are not talking about the kernel, why do you bring up Linus? He has 
nothing to do with GNU, GUIs, or applications. (OK, he did submit at least one 
patch to the Gnome project. Maybe a few other isolated submissions. But he has 
a full time job with the kernel.)</p>

<h3> Word is better? ...ahh, no. </h3> <br>
 Submitted by paul (the 
unverified) (not verified) on Sat, 08/16/2008 - 22:38. 
<p>This has not been my experience. I've been using OOo on winDOHs and Linux 
for the last 6+ years to process, edit, create all sorts of MS docs and 
spreadsheets for a client that is winDOHs only. All of my work is an 
improvement on theirs since I'm more familiar with formating and layout. I've 
also been using NeoOffice on the Mac for the last 3 or 4 years. I've always had 
an excellent experience with the software.</p> 
<p>OTOH, I have had many frustrations with MS Word. I'm also disappointed with 
the deterioration of the UI in Word. Back in '97 and '98, I used it for docs 
that consisted of several sections. The UI at that time was becoming bizarre 
and inconsistent, but I was able to get my work done. But for some reason, MS 
thinks it knows better and really began to screw with the UI not to mention 
bloating the daylights out of the software.</p> 
<p>The writers in my department all used PageMaker or FrameMaker. NOBODY 
wanted to use MS Word. NOBODY. Because it sucked. I was the only one (I being 
the manager of the group) that worked with it.</p> 
<p>So when a product manager came to us with a doc they had started in Word, 
rather than go through a messy convoluted conversion and since prod managers 
didn't really understand how to do much formatting to begin with, I finished it 
off.</p> 
<p>I was not about to expose the writers to an enormous amount of frustration 
and wasted time.</p> 
<p>I tried Word from time to time up until OOo came out and it still sucked. 
That's when I switched. I knew OOo would get better and MS Word would only get 
more bloated and more clunky.</p> 
<p>I'm glad you're able to work with it, but from my experience as a manager 
of a group of technical writers for 12+ years, MS Word does not cut it. It's 
fine for business letters, but if you have to create a larger doc, it's just no 
good. Even if you can keep it or winDOHs running.</p> 
<p>Over the years, I've almost completely migrated to Linux and OSS. The only 
proprietary software that I still use (occasionally) is Acrobat Pro, BBedit, 
and Bryce for my 3D stuff. I'm in the process of replacing BBedit with Bluefish 
and Acrobat Pro with several smaller light-weight apps. Bryce will be tough to 
replace, but I know there are good options available.</p> 
<p>So no. MS's software is the weak product. OSS on Linux is fine. I use a 
great deal of OSS a great deal of the time. I'm not alone. There are many 
people doing this. And we're all saving lots of money and avoiding a great deal 
of irritation because of better stability and security.</p>

<p>You can make any claim you want. But after &quot;winDOHs&quot;,

I don't believe a single word you say.</p> <br>

<h3> At least an entertaining read... </h3> <br>

<p>... but besides that not more than a confirmation that some folks get stuck 
in the past, or even worse an imaginary illusion of a past. By the way what 
personifies &quot;Linux people&quot; from users in general?</p> 
<p>Furthermore, many of us involved in what you call business already use 
Linux and BSD the way the article describes as a heterogeneous environment, and 
the Microsoft slice of the mix is declining. A decision made solely on the 
ground of technical merits. I actually don't care whether the developer looks 
like a hippy or dressed in a tux(edo), or what mentality he or she has, or as 
long as the code is effective and secure. Some things work well in Windows, and 
others are a nightmare, hence it's more pragmatic to be open to alternatives.
</p> 
<p>A couple of notes concerning your choice of word-processor: many writers 
would even argue that a word-processor is a poor choice, and that document 
processor like LaTeX is far better suited for the task. So opinions differ, and 
your &quot;truth&quot; isn't the absolute truth about computing. Anyway, it's 
still a good idea to have OpenOffice included in the software mix, because at 
times you actually come across Microsoft Office produced documents that can't 
be opened by current version of Microsoft Office (some updates have even broken 
fairly newly made documents). I've use OpenOffice as a rescue in many such 
situations.</p> 
<h3> Not Wrong </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Ken Sarkies (not verified) on Thu,

<p>When I was teaching Engineering all the postgrad students used LaTeX for 
their theses. One guy decided Word was the way forward. When he got about 150 
pages done, Word corrupted his document. He went back to the last good backup 
and tried re-entering his day's work. Again Word corrupted it. In the end it 
cost him a huge amount of time, frustration and effort splitting up the 
document into parts that Word would handle. This is where prejudices start.</p>

<p>Congratulations Glyn, that's one of the best articles I've read in a long 
time. I loved your comments about having an heterogeneous environment in 
particular. Even as a fellow LJ author, I have to admit that I'm not 
necessarily a Linux advocate, but an open source one. It's not Linux itself 
that captures our imagination, it's open source surely?</p> 
<p>There are some very cool looking alternative OSes being designed, and I 
certainly wouldn't want to steer anyone away from them into Linux for some 
weird reason. I think Linux has made for itself the biggest name in OSS, but 
Linux itself isn't really the issue. The more diversity in this environment 
that is picked up by the mainstream, the better.</p> 
<p>Cheers!<br>
