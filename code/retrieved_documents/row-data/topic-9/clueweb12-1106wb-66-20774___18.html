<h2>Linux: A Security Middle Ground</h2> 
<p> As OpenBSD is widely acknowledged as very secure and Windows NT and 2000 
come with minimal security following a default install, it's not surprising 
that Linux falls somewhere between. As Linux comes in a variety of forms called 
distributions, there is much variability as to just how secure a default Linux 
install is. At one end are products like Corel Linux that effectively turn off 
security. It sets up both root and an additional user with no passwords; there 
is no option to enter passwords and no instructions how to enter them 
afterwards. There is no shadow password file. It also sets up no networking, so 
the machine is accessible only locally following the install. Still it's a 
horrible example for users who will often be new to the UNIX world to suggest 
users and root don't need passwords. At the other end are Linux versions such 
as Trustix and EnGarde that are pre-configured to be secure and go further than 
OpenBSD in disabling and or not installing services.</p>
<p> By far the most widely distributed version of Linux today is Red Hat. The 
current version of Red Hat is 7.1. I first installed 6.1. I thought it was to 
be an experimental machine and loaded it with packages from both the 
workstation and server install. When the system came up, a number of services 
were running including telnet and FTP. There was little security provided by 
the install except the root and user passwords that were entered as part of the 
install. I never tried, so I don't know if the system would have accepted blank 
passwords.</p>
<p> File and directory permissions were typical of contemporary UNIX systems, 
reasonable but not as tight as they could be. Like most UNIX systems, including 
even OpenBSD to a limited extent, system files are generally world readable. 
While some need to be for the correct operation of the system, many do not. 
Having these world readable gives an intruder little advantage in either 
gaining access to the system or elevating access once they have limited (non 
root user) access. Having these files world readable gives a non privileged 
user the opportunity to look for potential weakness and to learn information 
useful in covering their tracks in the event they do elevate access. Non 
privileged user explorations are likely to go unnoticed on a busy system. If 
these files were only readable by root, all the exploration would need to be 
done after achieving root access and as root, increasing the chances of 
detection.</p>
<p> Still, if sound passwords are used for root and any users who can su or 
sudo to root, and default file and directory permissions are not loosened, it 
would be fair to describe a default Linux (most distributions) and most default 
UNIX installs as partly or moderately secure whereas default Windows NT and 
2000 server installs are unsecured.</p>
<p> One additional step, turning off all unused or unneeded services will 
significantly increase Linux security. This is simple, as a &quot;netstat 
-an&quot; or port scan from another nearby system will quickly reveal all open 
ports. UNIX services tend to be very easy to disable as there is typically one 
executable file per service that normally only uses one port to listen on.</p>
<p> In contrast, Windows services such as NetBIOS are more like a collection 
of related services. Parts of a service may be implemented in multiple 
executable files and a single file may contain parts of more than one service. 
Different NetBIOS related functions use ports from 135 to 139 and both TCP and 
UDP. On any UNIX system it's simple to disable NFS file sharing without 
impacting any other functions. On a Windows NT and presumably 2000 Server, 
though all disk shares on a system may be disabled, there is no way to disable 
disk sharing as a service without also disabling printer sharing and several 
other related NetBIOS services. It's this kind of confused design, akin to the 
registry and directory design, that makes it very difficult to make a Windows 
server system highly secure to perform a limited set of functions, without 
risking turning off services required by necessary functions.</p> 
<h3>Firewall in Red Hat 7.1 Install</h3> 
<p> Red Hat 6.2 was similar to 6.1. I never tried 7.0 but significant 
improvements were included in 7.1. The core of the install has much in common 
with earlier versions. If you don't select a server install, typical server 
daemons such as httpd and ftpd are not running following the install. The NFS 
related services are set up by default. The most important change is the 
inclusion of basic firewall configuration during the install.</p>
<p> I changed the firewall settings from the default &quot;medium&quot; level 
to &quot;high&quot; ignoring the &quot;low&quot; option and enable incoming SSH 
connections. The result was a system highly resistant to most network based 
attacks, at the end of the install. I ran an nmap scan from another machine on 
the same network segment. The new Red Hat system would respond to pings, so 
nmap could determine there was a system there. Otherwise it could learn nothing 
from the system. All ports were blocked. It could not determine the operating 
system with the OS finger printing feature.</p>
<p> There is nothing comparable in Windows NT or 2000 without obtaining a 
third party personal firewall such as Zone Alarm or Norton's firewall product. 
XP is to be released with a basic stateful firewall. As configured the Red Hat 
firewall is strict about inbound traffic and permissive about outbound traffic. 
It's my understanding the XP firewall will be similar but lack the capabilities 
included with the Linux firewalls that allow flexible control of outbound 
traffic, if you understand firewalls.</p>
<p> Underneath, none of the security basics were changed. For example Sendmail 
and NFS related services were started. The firewall is like wrapping a single 
layer shell around the system. It's very tough but if something does break it 
or somehow get through there are only standard UNIX security protections in 
place.</p>
<p> The firewall is able to provide this degree of protection by using what's 
called stateful inspection. Traffic that is started from the inside is allowed 
out and most replies to inside traffic are allowed to return. No traffic 
started from the outside is allowed in. With this approach there is little need 
to deal with specific ports or services. It's the closest thing there is to an 
instant security policy that is both functional and reasonably secure.</p>
<p> The firewall included with Red Hat 7.1 is likely to break some protocols 
that include separate communication channels started by an outside server. It 
did prevent an ntpd server using the UDP protocol added after the install, from 
working, until the firewall rule set was manually adjusted.</p>
<p> If you bring in a virus or Trojan horse via e-mail or a download, there is 
nothing to stop outbound communications initiated by such programs. Since all 
important virus and trojans for the past several years have been directly 
related to Microsoft products, this is unlikely to be practical issue on Linux 
systems. Further, if standard UNIX practices are followed and users normally 
login as non privileged users and not as root, hostile code will be severely 
hampered in it's ability to do damage.</p>
<p> I understand the virus and Trojan horse issues will apply to the firewall 
included with XP but that it lacks the ability to be configured to control such 
programs. I've read that Microsoft is not enabling as many services in XP but 
otherwise security will be even worse, at least on the consumer version of XP. 
All users will by default, operate as administrators. XP will rely almost 
entirely on the firewall for security.</p>
<p> As a practical matter, using the stricter firewall rules provided in the 
Red Hat 7.1 install, creates a system that in some important ways is more 
secure than any but a handful of systems available. In some ways, it's arguably 
more secure than the default OpenBSD install, as significantly fewer services 
are visible from the outside.</p> 
<h4>Firewall Problems</h4> 
<p> There are however some problems with the firewall install. First, the 
older IPchains is installed rather than the newer IP Table supported by the 
Linux 2.4 kernel. The Red Hat site says this is for compatibility and links to 
a number of sites related to both firewalls. I saw no direct explanation how to 
switch from one to the other.</p>
<p> If you were doing a 7.1 upgrade over a previous system that did not 
include IP Table, then keeping an IPchains configuration would make sense. On a 
new 7.1 install, installing already obsolete software which must be manually 
upgraded before the next upgrade, makes no sense. This is the stupidest thing 
I've seen in the current Red Hat install and the explanation on the web site 
strikes me as dishonest.</p>
<p> Further, the KDE System, Firewall control panel does not lead to the 
existing firewall rules. The Red Hat site, in its 7.1 &quot;Gotchas and 
Workarounds&quot; section, under Firewall Configuration tells what program root 
must run to configure the installed ipchains firewall. This only works when 
logged in as root and not via su. For anyone used to doing custom firewall 
configurations, the Firewall Setup program choices are exceptionally limited. 
Fortunately, they allow enough, that by manually examining the changes made, a 
knowledgeable user can do something useful by ignoring the warning not to 
manually edit the configuration file.</p>
<p> For example the Setup tool only provides the ability to allow or disallow 
a port (or service) and protocol. No source or destination addresses can be 
controlled and all are allowed. After looking at the configuration file, it's 
pretty obvious where the addresses go as the &quot;-s 0/0 -d 0/0&quot; are 
included in a new rule. Looking at existing rules, it's clear &quot;- s&quot; 
is source and &quot;-d&quot; is destination and that dotted decimal addresses 
with slash notation netmasks are expected. An optional port number immediately 
follows the address, separated by a space. Ipchains requires an initialization 
script to process the configuration file.</p>
<p> Actually ipchains is a utility that's an interface to the firewall built 
into the kernel. The script creates some standard sequences of ipchains actions 
(start, restart, stop, etc.). The configuration file is just a list of ipchains 
parameters applied sequentially, so for example after flushing existing rules, 
the &quot;configuration&quot; file is read and each new rule appended.</p>
<p> Conceptually IP Filter, provided with OpenBSD, is simpler in that an 
entire rule set is defined in a text file according to a standard format, and 
when told, the firewall process reads the file directly. The ipf interface 
command includes a flush option, but having the rules in a file avoids the need 
to write scripts that contain logic to verify the presence of configuration 
files and create loops to process these files.</p>
<p> I hope the Linux KDE system control panel is tied to the new IP Tables 
firewall that is not enabled during the install, and that there is better user 
control once IP Tables is enabled.</p> 
<h4>OpenBSD Firewalls</h4> 
<p> Like Linux firewalls, OpenBSD firewalls are not for those dependent on GUI 
interfaces either. It's not enabled by default and when it is turned on the 
provided default rule set allows all traffic. A number of sample rule sets are 
also provided. The rules are slightly more straightforward and logical than 
ipchains and no additional script is required to activate the rules once 
defined. A utility, properly described by a man page, and with reasonably 
simple flags, applies the IP Filter rules once they are defined.</p>
<p> Setting up an OpenBSD firewall will require reading some documentation. 
There are several key documents, linked to from mypage on IP Filter, that 
describe how to set up a firewall on OpenBSD. There are about 50 pages of 
essential reading. (As the Packet Filter firewall scheduled to replace IP 
Filter is supposed to be functionally identical, the same documents should 
remain useful.) My first firewall attempts were successful and with the reading 
that I had to do to make the firewall work, I'd gained a good start on 
understanding both the theory and practice of firewalls. My TCP/IP 
understanding also increased significantly. A firewall appliance may be easier 
to set up and a very high end commercial firewall may have a larger integrated 
feature set but you'll have to accept that the firewall does what you think it 
does largely on faith, because much like Windows, these products are designed 
to hide the messy, i.e., technical, details of what they do an how they work 
from their users.</p> 
<h4>Back to Linux Firewall</h4> 
<p> Except for the latest version of Red Hat Linux wrapping a security shell 
around the product, Linux is by default less secure than OpenBSD for a number 
of reasons. For starters, the toughness of the shell depends on user choices 
and provides limited flexibility. For example I installed NTP 4, (ntpd), on the 
Linux workstation but it would not work. It ran but never synchronized the time 
or set the drift. While looking at the logs for one of the other machines, I 
saw repeated connection refused messages in reference to the workstation. Ntpd 
was running but communications from the other servers were being blocked.</p>
<p> I was wrong about my initial reading of the default firewall rules. They 
were not entirely stateful or the ntpd server answers to the workstation 
queries would have been allowed back in. I had to explicitly allow inbound UDP 
traffic on port 123 for the workstation. Though I'd never worked with ipchains 
before, it took less than an hour to figure out but that's still a lot of time 
for the size of the task. It was more than three times, perhaps five times as 
long as it took to install NTP in the first place, and longer if you count the 
time spent trying to figure out why ntpd was not working on the Linux 
workstation in the first place.</p>
<p> Another reason Linux is less secure than OpenBSD is so much more is 
included with it. The OpenBSD install for Intel architecture fits on one CD 
with room for the source tree and about three other platforms on the same CD. 
The core of Red Hat Linux install now takes two CDs. The top of the line 
product includes five additional CDs. A basic OpenBSD install is less than 
200MB and a stripped install can be a little over 100. A basic Red Hat Linux 
install is about 500MB and can easily go over 1GB if many optional components 
are added.</p> 
<h3>Default Install Conclusions</h3> 
<p> The default OpenBSD install is much more secure but also much less 
functional than a Windows NT or 2000 default install and most Linux installs 
occupy a middle ground in both regards. With the addition of a Firewall 
included as part of the install, if the users change the default options and 
select the maximum firewall security choices on the Red Hat 7.1, a new Linux 
system can at the conclusion of the install, be in some ways more secure than a 
newly installed OpenBSD.</p>
<p> After any firewall setting issues are addressed, OpenBSD is a more secure 
system than standard distributions of Linux. Both OpenBSD and Linux, with 
relatively standard and similar steps, can be made significantly more secure. 
It is not difficult to turn either into a secure, very narrowly purposed 
machine that cannot easily be used for other functions. It takes a moderate 
amount of work to improve the default Windows security settings to approximate 
Linux default security characteristics and much more to try to achieve security 
comparable to OpenBSD.</p>
<p> The biggest difference between OpenBSD and Linux are the number of bugs in 
the underlying systems. As Linux has so many more bugs, new security exploits 
that take advantage of those bugs will continue to be found at significantly 
higher rates than for OpenBSD. As Windows appears to even more bugs than Linux, 
it's unlikely to ever approach OpenBSD security characteristics.</p>
<p> Though theoretically, Windows servers have significantly longer security 
related feature lists than any standard UNIX system, implementation issues 
prevent the effective use of these features. An excellent file and directory 
security system is defeated by the option to use an alternate non secure FAT 
file system, default settings that effectively turn off security when the 
secure NTFS system is selected and a lack of tools to efficiently control file 
and directory permissions. Other implementation issues make it effectively 
impossible to disable unneeded functions without also disabling necessary ones. 
Default security for Windows NT and 2000 are a distant third to both OpenBSD 
and Linux.</p> <b> &lt;P  Break-In Numbers &lt;<br>
