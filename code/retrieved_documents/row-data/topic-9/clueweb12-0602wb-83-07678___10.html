<li> 11.  Power Consumption Tests </li> </ul> 
<p>Our Windows Vista coverage began with a hands-on diary by MobilityGuru's 
Barry Gerber, followed by an assessment of gameplay under Windows Vista by 
graphics presidente Darren Polkowski, as well as a completefeature rundown of 
Vista. Barry took the new operating system and its look &amp; feel with a grain 
of salt, while Darren was disappointed because OpenGL support was dropped along 
the way, meaning that Windows Vista currently offers horrible performance for 
graphics applications utilizing the Open Graphics Library.</p> 
<p>We are sure that mainstream users will appreciate the improved usability of 
Windows Vista, and the average office/multimedia user will likely never notice 
the lack of OpenGL. However, a chapter on the overall performance of Windows 
Vista requires more dedication. In particular, two things require an in-depth 
analysis:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Basic Windows Vista Performance <br>
 How does Windows Vista perform 
compared to Windows XP? Will applications execute equally quickly, or will they 
even run slower due to the new features and the AeroGlass interface?</li> 
<li>Windows Vista Performance Enhancements <br>
 With SuperFetch and 
ReadyBoost, Windows Vista introduces two features to make use of today's 
technology in order to improve the user experience. This means that more 
application data should be actively cached into all available memory 
(SuperFetch), whether that is physical RAM or a USB Flash memory device 
(ReadyBoost). Microsoft's goal was to create balanced performance by removing 
delays in everyday work.</li> </ul> 
<p>This article deals with basic application execution under Windows Vista 
Enterprise, which is representative of the other editions. We put together a 
high-end test system and performed a comprehensive benchmark session both with 
Windows XP Professional and with Windows Vista Enterprise to see if there are 
differences. And indeed, we found that there are some...</p> 
<h3>Software And Vista</h3> 
<p>Although the main Windows Vista core has undergone lot of modifications, 
many of your applications will work with Vista. There is, however, no 
guarantee. You should definitely try any essential software on Windows before 
you upgrade.</p> 
<p>Process scheduling and thread pooling have been improved in Vista; a 
deadlock protection mechanism and hardware partitioning for virtualization 
support were added, together with many more features.</p> 
<p>We tried lots of different programs under Windows Vista Enterprise, and 
came up with a list of software that definitely works.</p> 
<h5>Games</h5> 
<ul> 
<li>Call of Duty 2</li> 
<li>Far Cry</li> 
<li>F.E.A.R.</li> 
<li>Unreal Tournament 2004</li> </ul> 
<h5>Applications</h5> 
<ul> 
<li>Adobe Acrobat 8</li> 
<li>Adobe Photoshop CS2</li> 
<li>Autodesk 3DSMax 8.0</li> 
<li>AutoGK 2.4</li> 
<li>Hamachi</li> 
<li>KeePass 1.06</li> 
<li>LAME MP3 Encoder</li> 
<li>MainConcept H.264 Encoder</li> 
<li>Miranda Messager 0.5.1</li> 
<li>Microsoft Office 2003</li> 
<li>Microsoft Office System 2007</li> 
<li>Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.1</li> 
<li>Mozilla Thunderbird 1.5.0.9</li> 
<li>Nokia PC Suite 6.82.22.0</li> 
<li>Ogg Vorbis 1.1.2</li> 
<li>OpenOffice 2.1</li> 
<li>Picasa 2</li> 
<li>Putty</li> 
<li>Skype 2.5.x and 3.0</li> 
<li>SmartFTP 2.0</li> 
<li>Sungard Adaptive Credit Risk Calculation 3.0</li> 
<li>SonyEricsson PC Suite 1.30.82</li> 
<li>SQLyog 5.22</li> 
<li>Symantec AntiVirus 10.2.0.224</li> 
<li>UltraEdit 32 12.10</li> 
<li>WinRAR 3.70</li> 
<li>XviD 1.2.0</li> </ul> 
<h5>Benchmarks</h5> 
<ul> 
<li>3DMark 06</li> 
<li>Cinebench</li> 
<li>PCMark05 Pro</li> 
<li>SiSoft Sandra 2007</li> 
<li>SPECviewperf 9.03</li> </ul> 
<p>In other cases there were some issues.</p> 
<p>We found Vista updates for the Futuremark benchmark programs 3DMark and 
PCMark, as well as the popular data compression tool WinRAR. Lots of 
video-related software such as DivX could no longer be installed; new versions 
are required. The popular audio player WinAMP 5.32 throws up an error at 
startup, yet it works properly. Quake IV can still be executed, but the 
installation program did not work. Applications that run their own memory 
management won't benefit from Vista's SuperFetch function. For example, Adobe 
Photoshop takes care of creating a temporary work file every time it launches - 
Vista has no access to this process and cannot speed it up.</p> 
<p>There are some types of software that you should only use if they have been 
specifically designed for Windows Vista: firewalls, anti-spyware and anti-virus 
software needs to be Vista-Ready.</p>

<p>I can't tell if you were using 32 bit or 64 bit Vista? I think it makes a 
big difference.</p> Anonymous  08/21/2008 7:59 AM <br>

<p>I herd that Vista has been so bad in a number of different ways that 
Microsoft have decided to give up all hope and have started building a new 
operating system witch will scrap Vista once on the market, is there any truth 
in this?</p> Anonymous  09/12/2008 10:44 PM <br>

<p>@crazyjew: They are in fact making a new Windows (codenamed 
&quot;Vienna&quot;) but this is just a scheduled release - they can't make 
money if don't make a new OS every few years!<br>
<br>
Well of course 
&quot;Vista feel[s] faster and smoother&quot;. It manages to use about 4 to 5 
times as much RAM as XP. That's QUINTUPLE the memory! This is hardly an 
achievement, considering.</p> Vulcan64  09/14/2008 9:19 AM <br>

<p>i am running a AMD6 X2 5600+ with 3gig DDR2 800mhz ram and a Nvidia 8600GT. 
And i have rund Vista 32bit and 64bit service pack 1 and i can say vista sucks 
i have problems with some of my software(updated for vista) and games don't run 
or they run but very crappy. On Xp Service pack 2 every thing run 110% without 
any problems. So i say stick to Xp for now and Please dont run service pack 3 
there is something wrong with it, i don't know what but me and some others have 
notice some problems with it(performance and networking).</p> salem80

i recomment u to return to teh old and good and really fast 
DOS. Remember it? no f..ing graphics, no mouse, no sound, no multitasking, no 
security, nothing fancy. but teh OS didn't consumed almost any hw resources. 
you would love it</p> Anonymous  09/30/2008 11:30 AM <br>

<p>lmao people are you serious? You're going to wait for Windows to come out 
with a NEW OS?? why? Switch to MAC or Linux. At least they aren't just trying 
to scam everyone out of their money, they deliver results and even have better 
support options. Whatever brainwashed opinions you have that Windows is a good 
brand, it's not true.. please open your eyes and get over your Microsoft 
&quot;Crush&quot; and see them for who they are.</p> Anonymous  10/03/2008

<p>Can you do benchmark tests, with service pack 1, with actually address the 
issue of slow file operations.<br>
<br>
Vista, actually uses all spare memory 
for caching, unlike xp which didn't and thus you had unused ram, I would rather 
have memory been used rather idle.<br>

<p>Fetching applications is good, so you end up USING your ram (if I have 4Gb 
ram is because I WANT to use them) but the drawback is that booting and 
starting rarely used apps became *slow as hell*, and also waking up from 
standby because the os must read out from disk lots of useless memory. What if 
your usage pattern varies much? You won't benefit at all from superfetching. 
That is exacly what happened to me... I gave up vista after a month or so of 
usage: a day it took almost 20 minutes to boot and start vmware server and a 
virtual machine on a 2Gbram/duo core2 laptop: a collegue with a single core,1Gb 
older laptop and gentoo linux booted and started 2 istances of the same vm in 
less than 5 minutes!!!</p> campdude  11/17/2008 3:50 AM <br>

<p>Now would be a good time to try an alternative os. I tried Ubuntu due to my 
disliking of vista.. I had trouble with importing mail into windows mail, 
trouble finding other computers on the network via \\machinename\ but 
\\192.168.x.x\ would work, wtf? Problems with vnc programs, UAC (what a 
nightmare), and programs hanging and an inability to get up the task manager.. 
wtf?! Anyways, Tried Ubuntu, and I think its great. Started using it 8+ months 
ago and never looked back. I always thought linux would be hard, and a few 
years ago it was, but now its not too shabby.. Oh yeah, you can run it under 
windows if you'd like also.. or dual boot and keep both windows and ubuntu..</p>

<p>I would love to see a follow-up to this at a later date to compare Vista to 
the upcoming Windows 7. I expect little difference, but it would be great info 
to know.</p> wellivea1  09/24/2009 11:06 PM <br>

<p>i bought vista business N Edition and i found it faster sleek and used my 
old computers full speed a system specs: 2.93 ghz celeron D 2006 512mb of ddr3 
ram ati radeon graphics 2009 x fire 512 MB and it works 65% better than it used 
too and my new laptop it is the same except new (not sys specs) i love it its 
the hard ware i guess and go to user accounts in control panel to disable (UAC) 
user account control!!!</p> mousemonkey  12/30/2010 2:06 PM <br>
