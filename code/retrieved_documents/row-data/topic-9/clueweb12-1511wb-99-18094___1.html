<h3> &quot;Using Windows as a Solid, Dependable Hosting Platform&quot;</h3> 
<br>  A conversation with Souhil Benammour &amp; Michael Butler of OutSource 
Information Systems <br>
<i> 
<p> OutSource Information Systems provides Web hosting and development 
services, as well as PC and network support, to customers in the private and 
public sectors.</p> 
<p> Case studies provide technical decision-makers with concrete examples of 
how adapting technology can help solve business problems. We chatted with 
Souhil Benammour and Michael Butler of OutSource Information Systems to get 
their perspectives on the customer-driven and ever-changing industry of Web 
hosting.</p> </i> <br>
 Key Findings: <br>

<p> OutSource Information Systems made a commitment to Microsoft technologies 
early on as their platform of choice for Web hosting, and they have seen the 
strength of that choice grow over time:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Partnering with Microsoft helps OIS identify business leads that help fuel 
the firm's continuing success</li> 
<li>Patching Windows applications is simpler than corresponding Linux-based 
patching</li> 
<li>The revenue associated with OIS's Windows hosting business prevents 
licensing costs from being a burden</li> 
<li>The growth in Windows as a hosting platform is aided by increased support 
for open source applications, as well as improved PHP compatibility</li> </ul> 
<br>  Questions: <br>

<h4> Souhil and Michael, can you give us some information on your background 
and on OIS?</h4> 
<p> <strong>Michael Butler:</strong> I am one of the co-owners along with 
Souhil. We incorporated the company back in 2003. Both Souhil and I come from a 
long IT background, with each of us having approximately 20 years of IT 
experience.</p> 
<p> Souhil Benammour: I am the co-owner along with Michael. OIS was focused on 
Microsoft technologies from early on, and lately we have started offering 
Virtual Private Servers, which we feel will be the next generation of hosting.
</p> 
<h4> Why go with Microsoft?</h4> 
<p> <strong>Souhil:</strong> We decided to go with Microsoft because we felt 
that Microsoft had some great new emerging technology at the time such as 
ASP.NET, and we also thought SQL Server was a very strong database platform.</p>
<p> We also saw that with the release of Windows Server 2003, Microsoft was 
making a push to get hosters on Windows. That made it a very good time to get 
into the hosting business with Microsoft.</p> 
<p> Microsoft had done a good job of providing documentation and a strong SDK 
for new Web development technologies such as ASP.NET. We saw a lot of 
developers becoming interested in building applications on top of ASP.NET and 
Windows.</p> 
<p> Microsoft also made it easy to purchase Windows as a hoster, in terms of 
keeping the overall cost for licenses low.</p> 
<h4> Has Microsoft been able to help you drive new business for OIS?</h4> 
<p> <strong>Michael:</strong> They have a number of resources for hosters to 
take advantage of, from broad-based marketing resources to lead-generation 
tools.</p> 
<p> Trying to go out there and find customers on your own can be a very 
expensive proposition. One of the things that Microsoft helps us with is that 
they bring us leads and they help us to identify and target the right ones to 
go after.</p> 
<p> We have had many customers come to us through Microsoft sites and 
Microsoft-based channels. We have customers coming to us from all over the 
world.</p> 
<h4> What are some differences that you as a hoster see between Linux and 
Windows?</h4> 
<p> <strong>Souhil:</strong> A bad point about Linux is that it can&rsquo;t 
simply be a black box. With Linux, I had some issues that I couldn't initially 
fix on my own. I had to just basically copy and paste some things I found 
without really knowing what was going on after I applied the fix.</p> 
<h4> In terms of keeping systems patched, what differences have you seen 
between Linux and Windows?</h4> 
<p> <strong>Souhil:</strong> It is definitely easier to patch an application 
running on Windows than one running on Linux. There is no doubt about that. On 
a Linux-based server, you have to first look for the right distribution, then 
the right patch, download it, decompress it, run the script, and then make sure 
everything works correctly. There are definitely different approaches to 
patching when you compare Windows and Linux.</p> 
<p> In this area, the big problem that I have with Linux is that there are 
tons and tons of software libraries and a number of small tools, and that can 
make it hard to determine what approach to take to solve a problem and which 
application to install to solve it the best way.</p> 
<p> That makes it hard to maintain a server.</p> 
<h4> What about configuring each platform? Have you seen some key differences?
</h4> 
<p> <strong>Michael:</strong> There are always going to be more question marks 
around configuring a Linux server. With Windows, I think we all feel a bit more 
comfortable in knowing that it is going to operate as we expect it to. With 
Linux, it might be free and all, but there seems to be more work to get things 
to really work right.</p> 
<h4> What about cost differences between Linux and Windows?</h4> 
<p> <strong>Souhil:</strong> We have a hoster-specific license agreement with 
Microsoft, so all of our licenses go through that agreement. Basically, we 
report on a monthly basis how many licenses we need and go from there.</p> 
<p> Linux is free, of course, but with Microsoft you get a consistent, secure 
server. There is a cost for that in the form of an up-front license cost, but 
with the revenue we get from the Windows hosting side of our business, the cost 
for licenses isn&rsquo;t a burden.</p> 
<h4> How do you feel about Microsoft offering PHP support on Windows Server?
</h4> 
<p> <strong>Souhil:</strong> By offering PHP on Windows, Microsoft recognized 
that PHP is in use by a fair number of developers, so I think offering PHP on 
Windows is a good thing. It will give potential customers choice in where they 
run PHP-based applications.</p> 
<h4> What are your thoughts on the fact that the number of IIS-based Web 
servers are essentially on par with the number of Apache-based Web servers?</h4>
<p> <strong>Souhil:</strong> I think this is happening for two reasons. First, 
there are more and more open source projects and open source applications 
supported on Windows. I know that there are a lot more open source 
applications, Web applications, CMS applications, and others that are going to 
be used on top of IIS. And the second thing is that there is better PHP 
compatibility with Windows and IIS.</p> 
<p> <strong>Michael:</strong> Microsoft has improved IIS over time. The 
stability is there now, and the feature set has increased to the point where 
the gap has closed between IIS and some of the other competitive Web servers. 
People are more trusting of IIS now, and they are more confident in its ability 
to deliver. I think that is one of the reasons the gap has definitely narrowed.
