<h1>Linux</h1> <br>

<h2>What is Linux?</h2> 
<p> Linux is a free and readily available operating system for computers. Very 
similar to Unix, it can run on a number of different platforms - IBM-compatible 
PCs using the Intel 386 CPU and upwards, Digital Alphas, Macintoshes, Sun 
Sparcs, Ataris, Amigas and even the 3Com Palm Pilot, although it is probably 
true to say most Linux systems are based on Intel PCs, as this is the cheapest 
and most popular computer system around. It has all the facilities, features 
and tools you would expect of a commercial Unix and some significant plus 
points - it will run on ordinary low-cost PCs, software for Linux is mostly 
free and commercial software is inexpensive, support is excellent and ongoing 
development is certainly dynamic!</p> <br>

<h2>Where did Linux come from?</h2> 
<p> A Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, daunted by the high cost of commercial 
Unix implementations, decided to create his own version for his personal use 
and while at Helsinki University, began work on the kernel of what was to 
become Linux. Together with supporting utilities and tools from the GNU Free 
Software Foundation, the end result was a fully fledged Unix-like operating 
system which he dubbed Linux (Linus's Unix).</p> 
<p> Linus made his operating system freely available on the Internet in 1992 
to all who were interested in using it or, better still, helping with its 
continuing development, adding new features to it and expanding its 
capabilities. The new operating system went public in 1994 with release v1.0 
and the result is what we have now - a serious rival to traditional Unix which 
has many advantages ...</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>it is free</b> - under the  GPL (GNU Public Licence), it is free 
software and freely shareable as long as the source code is also distributed 
with it. Commercial vendors may make a small charge for distributing it (eg, on 
CD-ROM media for example) but they must comply with the terms of the GPL.
<p></p> 
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>source code is always available</b> - you'll never get this with 
commercial Unix implementations costing thousands of pounds, never mind 
anything from Microsoft!. Having the source code allows you to compile your own 
kernel just the way you want it, or to suit the needs of your hardware or 
application. You are also free to add extra features to it to be included in 
the next general public release of the kernel, as long as you also make 
available the source code with your enhancements.
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>it is right up to date</b> - as new hardware, devices and peripherals 
evolve, the Linux community rapidly responds by writing new drivers and 
providing kernel support where necessary. Development is driven by the needs of 
its own users, not some marketing department seeking fresh sources of revenue.
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>it is relatively bug-free</b> - it is in the Linux community's own 
interests to hunt down and rectify bugs. With hundreds of enthusiastic users 
and programmers linked via the Internet worldwide, bug reports are circulated 
rapidly and bugs fixed quickly - sometimes within hours of their being reported.
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>it is fast &amp; efficient</b> - equalling and in many cases exceeding 
the performance of other Unixes such as Solaris. Microsoft Windows? no contest!
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>it is very powerful</b> - with so many utilities available for it 
together with the almost limitless configurability of Unix, there is 
practically nothing you cannot do with Linux.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Linus has given many interviews but the longest one I'm aware of has to be 
this one in which he gives us a frank insight into many aspects of Linux, even 
Microsoft Windows ... For a good overview of Linux, readthis . And  this too.

<h2>Linux distributions - what are they?</h2> 
<p> On its own, the Linux kernel can't be used for very much - it's a bit like 
having MS-DOS but without the COMMAND.COM shell and all the utilities such as 
ATTRIB, SCANDISK, FORMAT and so on, that make it do something useful. So you 
need to add extra software and tools to the basic kernel before you can use 
Linux and this is where<b><i>distributions</i></b> come in. Linux distributions 
are simply collections of utilities, editors, tools, programming languages, 
network software, etc that have been put together along with the basic Linux 
kernel by various people and offered as a more or less complete package. (You 
can of course put together a Linux system from the bare bones, marrying your 
kernel - with suitable in-built drivers to match your hardware - to your own 
hand-selected choice of shell, getty and login utilities if you really want to 
but why bother going to extreme lengths when the standard choices will be OK 
for nearly all users?).</p> 
<p> Distributions vary in what they offer, in the range of software provided 
and in the ease of installation but all will give you a fully-functional Linux 
system when installed. Some versions are intended for typical office use while 
others are more suited to programmers but the important thing is that you can 
always add software and utilities to make your system do what you want it to 
do. My favourite distribution is Patrick Volkerding'sSlackware - mainly because 
I started my Linux experience with it back in the days when you could (and 
still can) download it over the 'Net via FTP onto a series of floppies; also, 
it is a very down to earth 'nut's n' bolts' distribution ideal for computer 
techies like me :-)</p> 
<p> Other distributions are aimed at novice users or those who want a slick 
GUI installation program like those offered by Apple and Microsoft for their 
operating systems -Red Hat has a very polished and painless install procedure 
from its CD-ROM (I use Red Hat Linux version 5.1 on my Dell laptop) and so does 
S.u.S.E (I run S.u.S.E. 6.0 on an old Gateway 486 that used to run Windows 3.1 
in one of King's College's open access PC rooms at the Strand). There are a 
number of other offerings from Caldera (who are probably the best bet for 
corporates who want to pay for hand-holding/support), Debian, and so on. For 
the full range of distributions, check out the distributions list.</p> <br>

<h2>Where can I get it?</h2> 
<p> Linux is a child of the Internet, the work of many hundreds of programmers 
and enthusiasts across the planet, and fittingly, you can download it from FTP 
sites all over the world. Trythe Linux home site for starters or you may get a 
faster response from the UK Linux web site. Sunsite Northern Europe(formerly 
known as the Imperial College Archive) has them all too.</p> 
<p> If you've got a network connection at work, university or whatever, this 
is the cheapest way of getting Linux - it costs you absolutely nothing except 
for some space on your hard disk or maybe a box of floppies! Also, if you have 
a computer that has neither a CD-ROM drive nor an Internet connection, a floppy 
installation is the only way to get Linux onto the system.</p> 
<p> Now that most PCs have CD-ROM drives, increasingly popular are the Linux 
CD-ROM distribtions and these are a great way to get Linux. Forabout &pound;2 
plus postage you get a CD-ROM packed with 500-600 Mbytes of Linux executables, 
kernels, software and documentation; the charge just covers the cost of the CD 
media. If you want a printed manual, multiple CD-ROM sets in jewel cases, then 
you can pay anything from &pound;20 to &pound;50 but it still represents 
incredibly good value compared with what you get from 'you-know-who'. CD-ROM 
installation is the best way to go - it's fast and very professional install 
programs are now included on the disk. Also, you've got a huge amount of 
material all on a single disk. Incidentally, buying a CD-ROM can work out 
cheaper than your dial-up phone bills if your Internet connection is via modem.

<h2>Why Linux?</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Why Microsoft Windows?</h3> 
<p> <b>Why follow the herd when you can have for free something that is so 
much better?</b></p> 
<p> OK, the range and variety of applications software available for the Linux 
operating system is nowhere near as broad as that for Microsoft Windows but as 
more and more serious computer users are turning to Linux, the number of 
packages is increasing. Also, well known MS Windows software houses like Corel 
and WordPerfect have released X-windows versions of their popular products and 
Digital, Apple Computer and Silicon Graphics have actively encouraged the use 
of Linux on DEC Alpha AXPs, Macintosh PowerPCs and SGI systems. And now Dell, 
Hewlett-Packard and even IBM have seen the light and are actively supporting 
Linux by investing in Linux distribution vendors, offering it as a 
factory-installed alternative to Microsoft Winodws and providing support for 
Linux in the corporate workplace. It is probably correct to say the amount of 
software available for Linux is fast catching up with that for the Macintosh.
</p> 
<p> Being realistic, there's a long way to go yet. The day when you can go out 
and buy shrink-wrapped software for Linux off the shelf at the local branch of 
W H Smith, take it home and install it like a Windows program is still some way 
off. And there are few games and no children's or educational software of any 
description available for Linux, for example (although some DOS and MS Windows 
software can be run under the Linux DOS and Windows emulators). But it will 
come eventually. The PC World superstore chain has been selling Caldera 
OpenLinux alongside the typical Windows stuff for nearly a year now and Simply 
Computers have stocked Red Hat Linux since September.</p>

<h2>Why I avoid Microsoft Windows</h2> 
<p> Well, given the choice would <b>you</b> pay good money for an operating 
system that GPF's several times a week (Windows 95)? Or eats up so much memory 
and CPU time that printing an image to a colour printer pushes CPU utilisation 
to 100% even on a Pentium 150 (Windows NT4)? Or viewing a Quicktime movie on a 
children's 'edutainment' CD-ROM demands CPU resources beyond 100% so that 
eventually the program crashes (NT again)?</p> 
<p> There must be something wrong with these operating systems if things like 
these can be done with far less bother under plain old Windows 3.1. I have 
never known Linux itself crash, although X-servers occasionally hang if they 
are abused. I want to get things done with my computers and I want to trust and 
rely on them - and that simply means a 100% reliable operating system: Linux is 
that operating system.</p> 
<p> The current generation of operating systems from Microsoft demand ever 
faster Pentium CPUs, lots of RAM and increasing amounts of hard disk space; 
Linux will run well on an old 386 box even with X-windows - imagine what it can 
do when it runs on a 500MHz Pentium III PC, or even better, a 700MHz DEC Alpha 
AXP system ...!</p> 
<p> Microsoft Windows is relatively slow, unstable, is much less 
well-documented at a technical level and is such a mess internally that MS 
daren't fix the bugs for fear of either introducing more bugs or preventing 
existing applications that have been written around the bugs from working 
properly. Together with a typical range of application packages (which require 
huge amounts of disk space), Windows also costs a lot of money. Support from 
Microsoft is hard to get - if at all - and costs money too. On the other hand, 
the Linux/X-window combination is faster than any MS windowing system, is very 
well-documented both on the 'Net and in printed book form, most applications 
are free while commercial applications cost much less than the MS Windows 
equivalents and support ... well, it's all there for the asking on the 'Net - 
Usenet newsgroups, informative Web pages, FTP sites galore, completeLinux CD's 
for &pound;2.00 ....</p> <br>

<h2>I'm not out to bash Microsoft</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>What's the point?</h3> 
<p> Linux users know they are using something far better than Windows and they 
just get on with enjoying it! Not much reason to get hot under the collar or 
all wound up over all the millions of users who are still using MS Windows, is 
there really?</p> 
<p> There will always be Microsoft Windows in one incarnation or another, 
there will always be a huge mass market for Windows and software designed to 
run under Windows - there are lots and lots of people for whom Windows is quite 
adequate and simply does all they require of it. In the same way there will 
always be people who are quite happy with a Ford Mondeo or Vauxhall Cavalier, 
rather than something a bit classier.</p> 
<p> But it is important the computer user has a choice - how dull and boring 
it would be if all we had were Microsoft operating systems; no Mac OS, no VMS, 
no AS400, no flavours of Unix, no Atari TOS, no AmigaDOS. Some users find the 
Mac OS suits them better, others love VMS while some find Linux is best for 
them. And there has to be a choice too for those who want a really powerful and 
high performance operating system for their computers.</p> 
<p> Here Microsoft must tread carefully - seeking to dominate the world 
software arena will lead to an ever dwindling variety as this giant sucks up 
all before it. Microsoft's ill-concealed attempts in 1997 to take over and 
shape the future of the Internet by bundling Internet Explorer with its current 
operating systems landed it in court. It is the thin edge of the wedge - next, 
browsers are becoming part of MS Windows and, left unchecked, Microsoft will 
then begin creating its own standards and foisting them onto the Internet 
community, creating a different kind of network that will slowly but inexorably 
squeeze out other operating systems. If this ploy were to fail, Microsoft could 
kill off most competing operating systems simply by buying them up.</p> 
<p> This will never happen to Linux - it is owned by a community, not a 
company or software house, and there is no way anyone (no, not even Microsoft) 
can stifle it by buying it. Microsoft might possibly seek to discredit it, or 
to launch a directly competing product, but why should it? In its latest 
deposition with the US Supreme Court hearing the current anti-trust case 
against it, Microsoft has at last admitted it perceives Linux as a threat, but 
for the moment it simply ignores it.</p> 
<p> Microsoft is here to stay and so is Linux and rather than one camp 
slagging off the other, maybe we should just accept the two operating systems 
can co-exist quite happily - Windows NT4 and Linux in many ways integrate well. 
But let no-one be deluded - Microsoft's ultimate goal is total world domination 
in both operating systems and applications software, both on the desktop and in 
the corporate server market, making serious inroads into territory previously 
the sole preserve of mainframes and Unix. Given the chance, Microsoft will kill 
off all other operating systems - including Linux. Microsoft is not to be 
trusted.</p> <br>
