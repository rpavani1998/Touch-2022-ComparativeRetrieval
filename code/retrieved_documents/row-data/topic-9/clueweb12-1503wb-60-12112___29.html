<h2>Dual Boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu on Two Hard Drives</h2>  Thursday, February 
2nd, 2012 |Learn Linux - Linux help | 1 Comment <br>
<br>

<p>By Emma Rosenberg</p> 
<p>This article will detail how to dual boot Windows 7 and the latest Ubuntu 
distribution on a single computer using two hard drives. This is assuming you 
have two internal hard drives with an installation of Windows 7 already 
existing on one of them, and the second hard drive empty and ready for use. As 
a quick review of thesteps we will be going through, here are the steps in 
their simplest form. First, we will install a new Windows 7 copy or keep the 
existing installation. The second step is to acquire the latest Ubuntu 
distribution and then transfer it onto either a DVD, CD, or USB drive. Third, 
we will install Ubuntu onto the second hard drive. Lastly, we will make 
modifications to Windows 7 and its boot program, in order to boot Ubuntu from 
its boot menu. Once these steps are done, you will have a computer that can 
boot both Windows 7 from one drive, and Ubuntu from the other, and freely 
alternative between the two. Having such a system can be useful for anyone 
trying to create an Ubuntu dedicated server on a Windows 7 system.</p> 
<p>The first step is already assumed, so if you have not installed Windows 7, 
do so. We will begin on the second step, which is acquiring the latest Ubuntu 
distribution and then putting the downloaded image onto a DVD, CD, or USB flash 
drive. Go to the Ubuntu main website and go under the Downloads section. 
Download the release of your choice, but the latest distribution is always 
recommended. Most modern systems have a built iso burner, so proceed to burn 
Ubuntu onto the DVD/CD. If you don&rsquo;t have an iso burner, place the.iso 
onto your USB flash drive.</p> 
<p>Once that is completed, boot the computer from either the DVD, CD, or USB 
drive, depending on which option you chose. The installer will start 
automatically. Go through the initial steps per its instructions until you get 
to the &ldquo;Installation type&rdquo; page. There will be three options: 
Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7, Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu, and 
&ldquo;Something else&rdquo;. The last of the options, &ldquo;Something 
else&rdquo;, should be selected, and click continue. The first two options will 
install on the current hard drive, which is not what we want.</p> 
<p>You will be brought to Ubuntu&rsquo;s partitioning tool. Initialize your 
second hard disk by selecting it and then click on the button, New Partition 
Table. It will give a warning, which you can disregard and click continue. Once 
the hard drive has been initialized, you will create a partition on it made for 
Ubuntu. Make two partitions for / and Swap. To create these, choose the free 
spaces under SDB, and then select Add. The first partition is mounted in /boot, 
where you can choose between ext2 or ext4. The default disk space is optimal, 
so just leave the option as is and press Add. As for the second partition, it 
will be used for /, or the root file system directory. The most optimal disk 
space to designate for this partition is 4.4 GB, with file system of ext4. 
Press ok and add.</p> 
<p>With these two partitions successfully implemented, we must select the 
location which the boot loader is installed in. The default location is the 
Master Boot Record of disk number 1. Do not install it here. Instead, choose 
the Master Boot Record in disk number 2, where Ubuntu is installed. In order to 
accomplish this, alter the &ldquo;Device of boot loader installation&rdquo; 
from SDA to SDB. Make sure it is SDB, and then click Install Now.</p> 
<p>Following the installation, the computer will boot to Windows 7. The last 
step of the process is to add Ubuntu as an entry in the Windows boot menu. We 
have to access the Windows Boot Configuration Data (BCD), which can be done 
using quality freeware programs such as EasyBCD. Go to the EasyBCD website and 
to the downloads section, and select the &ldquo;Download free for limited, 
non-commercial use.&rdquo; The installation is straightforward and simple.</p> 
<p>Once installed, load up EasyBCD and select Add New Entry tab. Select the 
Linux/BSD, and select GRUB2 from the Type menu. Change the name field to the 
edition of Ubuntu you installed, and then select Add Entry. Select the Edit 
Boot Menu button to check your results. If everything is correct, exit out of 
EasyBCD. Restart your computer and see if Ubuntu is in the boot menu for 
Windows 7. If you&rsquo;ve followed this guide, then everything will work 
perfectly. Congratulations, you now have a system that can boot both Windows 7 
and Ubuntu on two different hard drives!</p>

<h2>Why is Linux Hosting Gaining More Presence than Windows Hosting?</h2>  
Wednesday, December 21st, 2011 |Linux Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Ravi Chamria</p> 
<p>Any person interested in publishing any data on the Internet requires Web 
Hosting. Web hosting has been around for several years now and has evolved from 
simple HTML pages hosting, small simple sites with a few images into full blown 
web based hosted applications where end users can visit a site, interact with 
the web site owner, and even purchase goods and services all over the internet.
</p> 
<p>The use of Internet as a medium for integrating business across the globe 
with the help of Web Based software applications has produced wide range of web 
based technologies like ASP, ASP.NET, JSP, PHP, and others. This choice has 
forced various options for web hosting now as HTML based sites work equally 
well on both Linux and Windows platforms.</p> 
<p>Web hosting platforms vary from different types of operating systems. 
Microsoft Windows Server and Redhat Linux are just two examples and probably 
the most well known web hosting platforms. So, what is Windows or Linux web 
hosting and what are the advantages and disadvantages to hosting your web site 
on either Server. And why now Linux is gaining more popularity. Well, 
that&rsquo;s just the answer isn&rsquo;t it?</p> 
<p>Linux platform has been developed by Community based efforts and it has 
been rendered for professional use with the efforts of many IT companies like 
Red Hat, Suse, Mandrake, and like. This background of Community development and 
open source nature of Linux Server and backup of professional IT companies has 
made Linux platform more powerful, inexpensive and secured.</p> 
<p>The cost effectiveness in this competitive era is a major boost that the 
companies required without compromising on the quality and security of the 
product. Apart from ASP, ASP.NET, all other major web based technologies work 
well with Linux. The virtually free distribution of PHP, MySQL, PERL has 
reduced the costs of the website hosting tremendously on Linux Server. At 
Sakshay, we provide both kind of hosting services but the advice to companies 
requiring Hosting for HTML based websites, small applications like Recipe site 
is to use Linux Hosting.</p> 
<p>The menace of viruses, spamming and hacking is also quite less with Linux 
Hosting. Firstly, this is due to the robust architecture of Linux Server and 
Secondly, due to many cost effective softwares available for protection on 
Linux Platform.</p> 
<p>The following are the advantages of using Linux based web server compared 
to Windows based web server:</p> 
<p>Stable and Robust: Linux/Unix operating systems has traditionally been 
believed to be very stable and robust. A web site housed on a Linux operating 
system will have very high up-time (of the order of 99.9%). Of course, other 
factors such as power supply, network admin skills, and network load etc. also 
matter when it comes to maintaining the system uptime.</p> 
<p>Low cost of ownership: The Linux OS comes free of cost (or at very 
insignificant cost, usually cost of distribution). Also, it has full fledged 
server, and desk top applications that comes free along with the OS. These 
server applications (such as FTP, Web Server, DNS Server, File Server etc.) 
being free, are also very stable.</p> 
<p>User Friendly: When it comes to web hosting, it is easy to host on Linux 
web servers. The process of uploading and hosting is almost same for both Linux 
and Windows web servers. If you want to use a Windows based tool such as Front 
Page for uploading a web site on to a Linux based web server, make sure that 
the Front Page extensions are enabled. This is only required if you are 
uploading using HTTP feature (http://www.yourwebsite.com) of Front Page. Front 
Page also makes it possible to upload a web site using FTP. You need to select 
[ftp://www.yourwebsite.com] for up loading using front page FTP option. Note 
that if you select &ldquo;Front Page Extensions&rdquo;; during web site design, 
you must enable Front Page extensions on a Linux web server also. These days, 
all Linux web servers are coming with installable Front Page extensions, and 
this should pose no problem for hosting on a Linux platform. You can use almost 
all types of file extensions (or scripts) when using Linux web server. 
Commonly, the following extensions are supported: .cgi, .html, .htm, .pl, .php, 
.shtml, .xml, and others. Basically it means that you can host web sites that 
use different types of server side scripts including .cgi, .pl, .php, and .asp 
(with plug-in).</p> 
<p>Easy to move between hosts: A web site designed to be hosted on a Linux 
based web server can be hosted on a Windows web server easily, where as the 
reverse is not always true.</p> 
<p>Most widely used: Linux/Unix based web hosting is most widely used compared 
to Windows based web hosting.</p> 
<p>Scalability: Scalability and future expansion are other major criteria to 
consider while hosting an application. A web site is dynamic. Usually, a web 
site starts with a few pages of html and grows over a period of time to suit 
the customers requirements. It is preferable to design a web site keeping this 
requirements in mind. A web site designed for compatibility with a Linux/Unix 
based web server meets the scalability requirement easily without making any 
site wide design changes.</p> 
<p>Self Management of your website on a Linux Web Hosting Plan with Sakshay 
hosting is made very easy with our Implementation of the Award Winning Control 
Panel software by Sw-Soft called Plesk. Plesk is a web based interface to your 
Linux web hosting account that allows you to create e-mail addresses and 
mailboxes, view your web site traffic statistics, set permissions on your HTML, 
PHP pages, MySQL, and more. We also provide Windows Hosting with Plesk Panel.
</p> 
<p>So, all kudos to Linux and open source technologies for making the 
technology affordable and within the reach of common man.</p>

<h2>Compare Linux Hosting &ndash; Which Operating Systems Are Best?</h2>  
Tuesday, December 20th, 2011 |Linux Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Evlondo Cooper</p> 
<p>There are many website creators who want to compare Linux hosting in order 
to see how it measures up with other operating systems. In the past, there were 
major differences between the Linux and Windows hosting platforms. Deciding on 
the operating system that you will use to host your site was a big factor in 
determining how the site would be designed. Now, in this period of cross-system 
web hosting, the differences in the operating systems are relatively small. As 
a result, the best Linux hosting and the best Windows hosting are nearly the 
same.</p> 
<p>There still are a few differences. The first difference is how users 
interact with the server. Usually, both offer FTP access to the files. Yet, 
Linux is the only one that offers telnet or ssh access. More than likely, this 
feature is aimed specifically at their respective target audiences. While 
Windows is targeted to the mass public, Linux is more focused toward the 
features that programmers want.</p> 
<p>Regardless, this is not a fundamental difference, since there is little to 
differentiate FTP from telnet or ssh practically. FTP lets you download the 
file locally, while telnet and ssh allow you to change the root file on the web 
server through UNIX commands.</p> 
<p>The second difference between Linux and Windows hosting is that they 
support different programming languages. Linux is usually associated with PHP, 
Perl, and CGI, while Windows is associated with ColdFusion and ASP. The 
database languages are also dissimilar, with Windows users favoring Access 
while Linux users prefer MySQL.</p> 
<p>Windows creates web pages in .htm format and Linux writes sites in .html. 
These differences will be of no concern to many people. However, they can make 
difference depending on your preference for a certain language. For instance, 
trying to make alterations to Access files using an operating system that runs 
on Linux can be quite frustrating for burgeoning site developers.</p> 
<p>Linux hosting plans are different from other OS hosting plans in other 
ways. In regards to security concerns, the common wisdom states that Windows 
has a variety of security concerns that make it more unstable. Mostly, this 
assumption is correct. It is important to remember that Linux has 
vulnerabilities too. Yet, most people agree that Linux is better at issuing 
updates and patches because their system is open source. Windows fixes their 
vulnerabilities when they issue periodic service packs. The average person 
looking to create a website relies on the network administrator for security. 
For competent administrators, it will not matter which OS is being used.</p> 
<p>You have to make the choice that best suits your particular needs. If that 
is Linux or something else, it is preferable to choose a Linux hosting plan or 
any other hosting plan solely on whether the features and services it provides 
are best for you. Yet, if your administrators prefer a particular language make 
sure that compatibility is not a concern.</p> 
<p>If specific requirements are not important, you should let qualified 
administrators examine whether you need the best Linux hosting plan or whether 
you should use another operating system. Instead, you should be trying to 
create a website with high quality content. Do not focus your efforts 
attempting to compare Linux hosting with other hosting platforms. Do your best 
to forge great content because it is a more pertinent consideration than the 
language you are using or the OS that is being used.</p>

. Moreover, I provide you information about thebest Linux hosting plans that 
will help you meet all your hosting needs.</p>

<h2>Windows vs Linux : Hosting</h2>  Saturday, December 17th, 2011 | Linux 
Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Teeyes Siva</p> 
<p>The Basics of Linux &amp; Windows :</p> 
<p>Linux (and its close relation Unix) and Windows 2000 (and its close cousin 
Windows NT) are types of software (known as operating systems) that web servers 
use to do the kind of things that web servers do. You do not need to know any 
real detail of either to make a decision as to which you need but here a few 
guidelines.</p> 
<p>Just because you use a windows desktop PC doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to 
opt for Windows web hosting (and the reverse is true as well). The operating 
system you use on your desktop has little to do with your choice of web hosts. 
As long as you understand how to use your FTP or web publishing software, your 
can use either operating system.</p> 
<p>But what is important is that you know what you want your website to do and 
what you want to offer on it. This is what will ultimately help determine the 
type of web hosting that will work best for you. As mentioned earlier, 
interactive websites usually rely on ASP, PHP, or Perl type languages.</p> 
<p>Linux Web Hosting or Windows 2000 Web Hosting ? Make your Choice !</p> 
<p>When it comes to Web hosting, Linux has, for some time, been widely 
considered the best OS for Web servers. It&rsquo;s typically found to be the 
most reliable, stable and efficient system and, as such, it&rsquo;s commonly 
used for the demanding environment of Web and mail servers. Indeed,Most of the 
clients websites of aalpha NET runs on the Linux OS precisely because of this 
traditional stability.</p> 
<p>The million-dollar question is what application are you looking to use for 
your hosting? Consider the tools and scripting languages you plan to use 
&ndash; if you use PHP, Perl or MySQL, Linux is the way forward. If apps are 
Microsoft-specific, then Windows is what you need.</p> 
<p>If your site, like most web sites, is what might be termed 
&ldquo;brochure-ware&rdquo; then Linux servers are ideal. By brochure-ware I 
mean a site that offers the kind of information that in the past might have 
been provided on paper in the form of brochures, newsletters or data sheets. 
Brochure-ware sites will offer some interaction through enquiry forms and can 
certainly incorporate online purchasing and other routine e-commerce functions.
</p> 
<p>If however your site incorporates an online searchable database or 
interactive chat facilities then Windows 2000 or NT will be a better bet in 
most cases. It will cost a bit more but you&rsquo;ll get that back in reduced 
development time and simply better functionality.</p> 
<p>The following are the advantages of using Linux based web server compared 
to Windows based web server :</p> 
<p>Stable: Linux/Unix operating systems has traditionally been believed to be 
very stable and robust. A web site housed on a Linux operating system will have

development of your web site, it is preferable to host with a Windows based web 
server.</p>

<h2>Linux Hosting Is Better Than Windows Hosting</h2>  Friday, December 16th, 
2011 |Linux Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Richa Sinha</p> 
<p>Confusion often arises while choosing a web-hosting platform, as which one 
is the best one and which one is the better one between Linux &amp; Window 
hosting. The million-dollar question is what application are you looking to use 
for your hosting? Consider the tools and scripting languages you plan to use, 
if you use PHP, Perl or MySQL, Linux is the way forward. If apps are 
Microsoft-specific, then Windows is what you need.</p> 
<p>Well in most of the cases, the general inclination generally moves towards 
the Linux web hosting platform and not on the window web hosting, because there 
are several positive factor that affect Linux and that Linux carries with 
itself.</p> 
<p>While casting our views on Linux hosting we conclude that Linux is more 
reliable. These are considered to be the best OS for web server. Linux web 
hosting are typically found to be the most stable and efficient system and as 
such, it is commonly used for the demanding environment of web and mail server.
</p> 
<p>Besides, reliability, cost effectiveness is also one of the most favorable 
factors that make Linux first choice. Generally, the Linux OS comes free of 
cost or at a very insignificant cost, usually cost of distribution. Also, it 
has full fledged server, and desk top applications that comes free along with 
the OS. And, these server applications being free are also very stable.</p> 
<p>In addition, Linux web hosting is easy to use and is perfect for your plan. 
When it comes to web hosting, it is easy to host on Linux web servers. The 
process of uploading and hosting is almost same for both Linux and Windows web 
servers. If you want to use a Windows based tool such as Front Page for 
uploading a web site on to a Linux based web server, make sure that the Front 
Page extensions are enabled. This is only required if you are uploading using 
HTTP feature of Front Page on your website. Front Page also makes it possible 
to upload a web site using FTP. These days, all Linux web servers are coming

<p>A web site designed for compatibility with a Linux/Unix based web server 
meets the scalability requirement easily without making any site wide design 
changes. A web site is dynamic. Usually, a web site starts with a few pages of 
html and grows over a period of time to suit the customer&rsquo;s requirements. 
It is preferable to design a web site keeping these requirements in mind.</p> 
<p>Today, Linux based web hosting is most widely used compared to Windows 
based web hosting. A web site designed to be hosted on a Linux based web server 
can be hosted on a Windows web server easily but this is not possible with the 
window web hosting.</p> 
<p>Therefore the above mentioned points proves that Linux web hosting maintain 
a much better position than window web hosting on the server platform.</p>

<h2>Windows Hosting versus Linux Hosting &ndash; Which is right for you?</h2>  
Saturday, December 10th, 2011 |Linux Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Joe Duchesne</p> 
<p>There are literally hundreds of thousands of web hosting companies out 
there. Many of these companies offer both Windows hosting and Linux hosting 
plans. Windows plans usually cost more because of the license costs imposed by 
Microsoft. Knowing this, how can you know when you need Windows hosting and 
when Linux hosting will work just as well or better? Keep reading to find out.
</p> 
<p>Windows operating systems are found on something like 95% of all personal 
computers in the world. With such a total dominance, Microsoft Windows is top 
of mind to most new people looking for web hosting.</p> 
<p>In the web server world though, Windows based servers are behind less than 
20% of all websites on the internet. This is according to the latest web server 
survey from securityspace.com. By choosing a Linux hosting plan, you will find 
yourself in good company.</p> 
<p>When do you have to use Windows Hosting?</p> 
<p>1. .NET technologies including ASP.net are not available on Linux 
platforms. If you have a website built with Microsoft .NET technologies you 
will have to choose a Windows hosting plan. In fact, if you need ASP without 
.NET features, most Linux hosting plans do not offer support for it.</p> 
<p>2. Access Databases are only available with a Windows hosting plan. Access 
runs on a Microsoft Windows platform and cannot run on a Linux Operating system.
</p> 
<p>3. MSSQL is an enterprise class database put out by Microsoft. If you need 
an enterprise class database there are some alternatives that run on a Linux 
platform but if you need Microsoft&rsquo;s MSSQL database, a Windows hosting 
plan will have to be your choice.</p> 
<p>4. If you are using Microsoft&rsquo;s Sharepoint services like some of the 
Sharepoint features found in Frontpage 2003, a Windows Hosting plan is your 
only choice.</p> 
<p>What is the advantage to choosing Linux Hosting?</p> 
<p>All the major services you need to run an enterprise class website are 
available on Linux based systems for free. Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP are 
being used together to provide the infrastructure behind some of the most 
traffic intensive sites on the internet.</p> 
<p>PHP runs better on a Linux server than on a Windows server. Having said 
that, unless you are putting a heavy load on your PHP scripts, this will not be 
noticable.</p> 
<p>In general, Linux hosting plans are at least 20% cheaper than Windows 
hosting plans. If you don&rsquo;t need any of the features mentioned above, 
Linux hosting is a fine choice for your needs.</p> 
<p>For Microsoft specific technologies, Windows hosting plans are usually your 
best bet. For everthing else, Linux hosting plans will usually do quite well. 
With the cost savings usually found with Linux hosting plans, Linux hosting is 
usually the right choice for you.</p>

<p>By George Szifo</p> 
<p>Linux web hosting (often referred to as LAMP &ndash; Linux, Apache, MySQL 
&amp; PHP) solutions are suitable for webmasters who use Linux hosting 
features, such as Perl programming, PHP programming and MySQL database.</p> 
<p>Windows Web Hosting gives a company the capability of designing web sites 
using the ever-popular Windows Operating System. This allows development using 
technologies such as Active Server Pages (ASP), COM, and the newer.NET 
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Disadvantage:-</p> 
<p>Linux based web server is not fully compatible with Microsoft technologies. 
If you are using any specialized applications or VB for development of your web 
site, it is preferable to host with a Windows based web server.</p> 
<p>Both these web server are used by users for different purposes and the 
selection of the web hosting depends upon the nature of the website or business.
Linux server administration and Linux server management has been more effective 
for complex websites, where as Windows servers are used for sites which needs 
different configuration.</p>

<h2>How to Select the Right Operating System for Your Web Hosting</h2>  
Thursday, December 8th, 2011 |Linux Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By John Lenaghan</p> 
<p>Windows or Unix/Linux &ndash; which operating system should you choose for 
your web hosting? This question is often asked when webmasters start looking 
for web site hosting. The operating system you choose can make a big difference 
in your business plans as your website grows.</p> 
<p>Windows-Based Web Hosts</p> 
<p>Windows-based servers use programs such as Microsoft Access and MS SQL for 
&ldquo;back-end&rdquo; operations. Scripting is also handled by Microsoft 
technologies such as ASP (Active Server Pages) and VBScript.</p> 
<p>Perhaps more importantly, Windows-based servers can easily be managed and 
multiplexed by using .NET technology. They offer excellent support, security 
and integration for Microsoft products.</p> 
<p>They&rsquo;re a good choice for either shared or dedicated hosting, but the 
features offered by Windows servers do come at an extra cost which may be an 
issue for small businesses.</p> 
<p>The reason there is often a higher cost associated with Windows servers is 
because the software they are based on costs the hosting company money. They 
have to buy them all from Microsoft, and that cost gets passed on to you.</p> 
<p>This is in comparison to the free software technologies which are generally 
used on Unix or Linux-based servers.</p> 
<p>Unix/Linux-Based Web Hosts</p> 
<p>Unix and Linux are two different operating systems, but because they work 
essentially the same way, we&rsquo;ll consider them as one for the purposes of 
this article.</p> 
<p>One of the most important characteristics of Unix-based servers is that 
they can handle a large amount of traffic. Unix is a robust operating system 
and can easily handle hosting multiple websites on a single server.</p> 
<p>They&rsquo;re also very flexible and the services running on a given 
webserver are easily customizable. Unlike Windows, Unix servers aren&rsquo;t 
limited to special remote administration programs. Any computer with an 
internet connection can login to a typical Unix server using freely available 
software.</p> 
<p>A lot of webmasters choose Unix over Windows because of the server uptime. 
Windows servers can provide very good uptime as well, but to do so the web 
hosting company has to be proficient with Microsoft systems. There tend to be 
more hosts who are familiar with Unix than with Windows on the hosting side of 
things.</p> 
<p>So Which is the Right Choice?</p> 
<p>For the average website, a Unix hosting plan is often the best choice. 
However, if you need to use Microsoft technologies such as Access or MS SQL 
databases, or ASP or VBScript scripting languages, you should opt for a Windows 
host.</p> 
<p>Note that even though Frontpage is a Microsoft product, it is supported by 
both Windows and Unix hosts. If you&rsquo;re considering a Unix host and using 
Frontpage, make sure they offer &ldquo;Frontpage Extensions&rdquo; support.</p>

<p>Which Operating System is More Functional &ndash; Windows Or UNIX (Linux)?
</p> 
<p>By Charles S Taylor</p> 
<p>Choosing the efficient Operating System is depends on several factors. 
Whether it is for personal use or for office use, choosing the OS platform is 
the vital part</p> 
<p>History of Unix chart (click for larger)</p> 
<p>of long-term plan, as it can&rsquo;t be changed often. You need to consider 
your requirements both short-term and long-term and the features of Windows and 
UNIX before choosing the OS.</p> 
<p>The following are the some of the important features and properties of the 
two Operating Systems that will help you to understand them better.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Multi-User System:</strong> Windows OS is designed to be used by 
one person at a time, whereas multiple persons can share UNIX OS at a time in a 
network.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Security:</strong> Windows users are burdened with the need for 
anti-virus and anti-spyware software. On the other side, for UNIX it is not 
required, as it is more secure than Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Bugs:</strong> UNIX has a reputation for fewer bugs (programming 
mistakes) than Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Performance:</strong> Under low-stress conditions, both have 
similar performance.</p> 
<p>However, under high load, UNIX is superior to Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Simplicity:</strong> To operate UNIX OS we need a little 
knowledge of Character User Interface, whereas it is very simple to operate 
Windows OS.</p> 
<p><strong>6. Compatibility:</strong> If you designed a website under a UNIX 
server you can easily host it on the Windows server, but the reverse is not 
always possible.</p> 
<p><strong>7. Website Hosting:</strong> If you want to use MySQL as backend 
then go for UNIX. If you need MSSQL as backend then Windows OS is a better 
option.</p> 
<p><strong>8. Application Software:</strong> You will get Application software 
along with UNIX OS package, whereas with Windows you won&rsquo;t get it.</p> 
<p><strong>9. Run the OS without installing it:</strong> UNIX can be run with 
Live CD even without installing it. Windows cannot run until it is installing 
into hard disk.</p> 
<p><strong>10. File System:</strong> UNIX protects data with Journalized file 
system, while Windows uses both journalized and non-journalized file systems. 
There is less protection of data with the non-journalized file systems.</p> 
<p><strong>11. Fragmentation:</strong> UNIX file system doesn&rsquo;t suffer 
from file fragmentation but Windows file system will be, which results a single 
file may scatter all over the hard disk as fragments.</p> 
<p><strong>12. Crossing the OS boundary:</strong> Some Application softwares 
written for UNIX will not run under Windows and vice versa.</p> 
<p><strong>13. Placing User Data:</strong> UNIX stores all user data in the 
home directory making it much easier to migrate from an old computer to new one.
</p> 
<p>On the other hand, Windows stores data anywhere in the hard disk making it 
hard to backup files when switching to a new computer.</p> 
<p><strong>14. Hardware Compatibility:</strong> UNIX can run on different 
hardware platforms but Windows can&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p><strong>15. Supported hardware devices:</strong> UNIX supports less 
hardware devices than Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>16. Ability to run without GUI:</strong> UNIX can run without 
Graphical User Interface so it needs less hardware horsepower than Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>17. Price:</strong> You can get a copy of genuine UNIX free of 
cost, whereas you have to buy Windows OS.</p> 
<p>The two Operating Systems serve different purposes. The above information 
helps you to choose the better one that suits your requirements.</p>

<h2>Unix Vs Windows Hosting-Which One Is The Best?</h2>  Wednesday, November 
23rd, 2011 |Linux Hosting | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Luis Carvalho</p> 
<p>This simple question is every day made by many web design newbie&rsquo;s 
looking for the perfect hosting plan for them. It is the first thing you should 
decide if you&rsquo;re planning to buy a web hosting plan.</p> 
<p>UNIX and Windows operating systems are the two main types of operating 
system platforms on which you may host your website. Each has its own set of 
unique features, advantages and disadvantages.</p> 
<p>The right question isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Which one is the best?&rdquo; but 
&ldquo;Which one is the right choice for your needs?&rdquo;. In this article I 
will show you the advantages of each one and a short comparison between them.
</p> 
<p>Before that, there&rsquo;s something you must know, the operating system 
that you use on your desktop has nothing to do whit the one used by your web 
host to serve your webpage Many people think that if they use on their desktop 
a Windows operating system they have to use a windows hosting plan, 
that&rsquo;s absolutely not true!! The same rule applies if you had developed 
your website with MS FrontPage, usually Unix systems have FrontPage Extensions 
installed.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s make a UNIX hosting overview:</p> 
<p>Nowadays most of the web designers are choosing UNIX servers to host their 
websites. Everyday Windows is losing costumers to UNIX hosting and the web 
hosts are exploring this fact offering daily new promotions and UNIX plans. And 
why are the web designers choosing UNIX plans? First a short and very important 
advantage: the price, the web host companies usually use free editions of UNIX 
systems like Linux Red Hat, Linux Fedora Core or even FreeBSD operating system, 
this fact lower the final price for the costumer because the web hosts 
don&rsquo;t have to pay for the server operating system. All the UNIX operating 
systems are under the GNU license, this means that anyone can access the source 
code and modify it, very important to optimize the server and resolve any 
problem or security issue, UNIX systems are the most flexible and stable. 
It&rsquo;s easier to upgrade and expand. By default these servers are installed 
in text mode, the system uses fewer resources and dedicates all its power to 
the WebPages hosted. Supports Perl, CGI-BIN, PHP3, Shells, MySQL, PostgresSQL, 
MS FrontPage extensions and much much more.</p> 
<p>Windows hosting overview:</p> 
<p>Everyone knows Windows server operating systems family! It&rsquo;s true 
that it is losing points to UNIX hosting, is true that is more expensive than a 
UNIX hosting plan but Windows still Windows!! And it supports some tools that 
UNIX cannot run.</p> 
<p>Only Windows plans support Scripting languages for dynamic content such as 
Active Server Pages (ASP) and ASP.NET, Cold Fusion, Active Perl and Visual C++. 
Only Windows hosting will run Microsoft specific applications such as MS SQL 
databases, MS Access Databases and IIS. (This is very important and if 
you&rsquo;re planning to use any of those languages or applications in you 
website, you have to buy a Windows hosting plan!).</p> 
<p>Now that you know the top features for each operating system, let&rsquo;s 
compare them:</p> 
<p>Performance:</p> 
<p>In low-stress conditions Windows and UNIX servers have very similar 
performances but under high load UNIX is very superior to Windows.</p> 
<p>Stability:</p> 
<p>UNIX handles high server loads than Windows; UNIX systems rarely require a 
reboot, Windows constantly need them. UNIX can run stable much time than a 
Windows server and UNIX up-time is bigger.</p> 
<p>Compatibility:</p> 
<p>If you design and program a website under a UNIX server you can easily host 
it in a windows server, but the reverse is not always possible, Avoiding 
windows languages (ASP, ASP.NET, etc) and databases (Access and MS SQL) is the 
better choice.</p> 
<p>Price:</p> 
<p>Any server hosting a website require a operating system and licenses, 
Windows 2003 and applications like SQL Server costs a lot of money, on the 
other hand, UNIX, usually Linux, is free to download, use and operate. This 
make the difference between the price, UNIX hosting will always be cheaper than 
a windows one.</p> 
<p>Conclusion:</p> 
<p>Unix hosting is more stable, has better performances, is more compatible 
and cheaper than a windows hosting plan. I always recommend UNIX hosting. You 
will only need Windows hosting if you&rsquo;re going to develop in ASP, .NET or 
VB.</p>
