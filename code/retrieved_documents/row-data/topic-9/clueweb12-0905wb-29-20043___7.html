<p>I wish I could switch to linux, but years of trying with various distros 
(I'm a 30-year IT veteran so I know a few things about computers and operating 
systems) has convinced me that linux is not ready for mainstream desktop use.
</p> 
<p>If you can use it on your system, and you don't mind playing around with 
obscure config commands buried in odd places within the file system, fine, but 
for most users linux just does not work.</p> 
<p>And as for ease of use - such as using a gui for configuration changes - 
forget it. I still can't get Ubuntu to work with my old Wacom graphics tablet 
without having to tweak parameters in the conf file when I do a system update - 
and even then the functionality is much less than I get from a default install 
of Windows.</p> 
<p>I want to spend my time doing productive work, not playing at system 
administration all day, so why should I bother?</p> 
<p>Yes Microsoft sucks, but people still use Windows because the competition 
hasn't come up with a better alternative for the majority of users. I wish it 
were otherwise, but until linux developers submit to rules for centralising and 
standardising the operating system configuration - to take just one example - 
and recognise that users' desire for gui-based user-friendliness is not an 
excuse to treat them as contemptible intellectual inferiors, it will remain 
geekware.</p> &lsaquo; This is what sets Linux apart from other mainstream os's.

<h3>Really? I was of the exact</h3> 
<p>Really? I was of the exact same mindset as you 4-5 years ago. I was happily 
plugging along in Windows, doing my daily work and whatever else I wanted to 
do. I am a Java developer, so I do quite a but of programming, and like you, am 
30 years old with a IT background. Anyway, when Microsoft released their trial 
copies of Windows 7 for beta testing, I was right there to give it a shot, and 
loved it. 1000x better than Vista, which I had been using on my new laptop, 
however when the day came that I had to either buy it or go back to Vista, I 
decided to go ahead and install Ubuntu in the interim until I could get a 
retail copy of 7. Funny thing is, I've been using Linux exclusively ever since. 
I did get a but tired of Ubuntu's updates, and have now settled into a nice 
Arch distro, sure it took me a few hours (the bulk of which was spent on my 
wireless adapter) to get it working just right for my system, but it was worth 
it. I learned more about my computer and how the OS works in that time than I 
had in years of working with Windows. I have VirtualBox set up with a copy of 
Windows XP, for application testing and if I need it for anything I can do in 
Linux. So far, the only Windows program I haven't found a decent replacement 
for is iTunes. I know such programs exist for linux, but it was faster to do it 
through the Virtual XP. If I didn't have an iPod, I wouldn't even need that. 
Gaming is another story, I don't really play games, so it's not as much of a 
concern for me as it might be for some.</p> 
<p>To each his own I guess..</p>

<h3>Windows is not in use</h3> 
<p>Windows is not in use because the competion hasn't been better, because 
first of all with computers that is a very vague and fuzzy issue. 
&quot;Better&quot; could mean any number of things, my TI-86 is better than 
windows...why? it never crashes it does exactly what i need and there is a long 
list of things that it can do that windows cannot not do, or at least do 
easily. Better alternatives popped up throughout history, and windows did not 
crush them with superiority or easy of use. Business tactics is the only reason 
windows won. Apple was significantly better (nothing fuzzy about it) from day 
one (*nix based...) and it did not win. But here we are 30 years later and 
apple is far from dead(better?).<br>
 I wish I could remember where I heard 
this, somewhere online no doubt. But &quot;better&quot; is irrelivant, the true 
essences of linux and windows (the kernels) are damn near equal. Windows stands 
out in terms of funding and the number of funded 3rd party developers (aka 
market share). Climbing up from the bottom today would be very difficult. But 
here comes Ubuntu making some small, tiny in fact, waves. And *nix has found a 
big foothold in servers and smartphones......<br>

<li>reply</li> </ul>  We are not against Linux but we are over the bullshit 
that surrounds a lot of the Desktop/UI related functions, we want to expose the 
serious issues so others can see what needs fixing, This is a forum provided 
for this to occur in.<br>
