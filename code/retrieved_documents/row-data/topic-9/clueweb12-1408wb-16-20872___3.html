Fighting Analysis Paralysis With Open Source?
<br>I stumbled across this analysis of the Linux Kernel which brought back 
&quot;fond&quot; memories of my market opportunity forecasting days. In the
analysis, the author, kripken, estimates that &quot;at most, 60% of the Linux 
Kernel...<br>

Novell Could Loose Access To New Linux Versions <br>
 Make a 
deal with a big closed source company and the FSF (Free Software Foundation) 
may pull your access rights to Linux Distro's. At least that is what Novell is 
facing this week. The Geek.com reports: The Free Software Foundation may ban 
Novell from selling new<br>

Invalidating The Linux Buffer Cache <br>
When 
you write data, it doesn't necessarily get written to disk right then. The 
kernel maintains caches of many things, and disk data is something where a lot 
of work is done to keep everything fast and efficient.<br>

Enderle On Linux</strong><br>
<br>
By <strong>Dan Morrill</strong> <br>
<br>

Linux does not exist except as a concept, we can all move on now.<br>
<br>
 No 
I am not bashing Rob, but I did find his paper &quot;The Five Things you Aren't 
Allowed to Discuss about Linux&quot; to be interesting from the technological 
view point. Since I use both Windows and Linux boxes on a regular basis, I am 
fairly familiar with the physical existence of both, and that each Operating 
System has its own fundamental peculiarities in how they are setup and how they 
are secured.<br>
<br>
 I already said there is no &quot;Linux,&quot; so how can 
I now treat it like a thing? The easy path here would be to present the 
different security models for the different distributions but, for this 
purpose, I'm going to leave Linux in abstract and talk about the unique 
security problem it represents. I'm not saying Windows is more secure either; 
I'm saying the products are so different from each other that comparisons may 
not actually make much sense, which is why there are reports supporting both 
sides of this. So, let's start by saying nothing is secure enough if people are 
involved. SourceRob Enderle <br>

<br>
<br>
 He is right, 
nothing is safe as long as a person is involved, and since people are involved 
in just about everything, then just about nothing is secure. What I think is 
most interesting about his view point into the security of Linux is:<br>
<br>
 
Linux exists in an environment where there is broad collaboration, but no 
effort to validate the collaborators so the opportunity for traditional, old 
style, data breach is immeasurable.<br>
<br>
 We know that pretexting is 
wide-spread, how much easier (and harder to catch and convict) if the person 
doing the pretexting doesn't even have to come up with a real fake identity?<br>
<br> If you are using Linux and haven't done a physical security audit in a 
while and specifically looked at who is collaborating with whom, I would say it 
is likely well past time. SourceRob Enderle <br>
<br>
 He's right, and here's 
why.<br>
<br>
 When we hire someone for a company, it is pretty standard to run 
a state level criminal background check (there are a couple of companies I know 
that don't do this, but most do). Some companies even run a federal level back 
ground check. Want to write code for government, expect to get a clearance. 
Want to write code for the NSA, you are going to get a polygraph and a 
background check.<br>
<br>
 Unless you have a state mandate, view people are 
going to do a background check on a volunteer. Rob has a point, and it's a 
pretty good one.<br>
