<h2>Tutorial: Install Linux Mint 12 KDE Using BTRFS File System</h2>  Tuesday, 
April 10th, 2012 |Learn Linux - Linux help | 1 Comment <br>
<br>

<p>By Emma Rosenberg</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In this tutorial, the reader will learn how to install the Linux Mint 12 
KDE on a btrfs filesystem. The B-tree File system (abbreviated to acronym 
Btrfs) has not matured far enough to be used as a default file system on Linux 
machines. Fortunately, those who choose to run Linux with btrfs do have options 
on installing useful components such as the highly coveted Linux Mint 12 KDE. 
For those who are not familiar, Linux Mint 12 KDE is a linux distribution based 
on the Ubuntu desktop operating system, and is gaining massive popularity in 
the past couple of months in the world of the low cost dedicated server running 
Linux. Due to popular demand, this tutorial will teach how to precisely install 
Linux Mint KDE on a btrfs file system.</p> 
<p>Before we proceed, do keep in mind that this tutorial is optimized for the 
current version of Linux Mint made available on their main website on January 
11,2012, which is still a release candidate. Regardless, the stable version 
will likely have an identical installation process as the current release 
candidate, so it should not affect the validity of this article.</p> 
<p>Installing a Linux distribution on a btrfs file system will require three 
partitions. The first partition is a boot partition, which is mounted at the 
/boot. The second partition is the root partition, which is mounted at /. The 
last partition is for the Swap partition, which provides disk space that the 
system will use as virtual memory.</p> 
<p>In order to setup these partitions, download the installation file for the 
distribution from the Linux Mint download page. Stick the downloaded package 
onto either a DVD or a USB stick, and boot the computer accordingly.</p> 
<p>After the computer has booted, the Linux Mint 12 KDE installation should be 
on your desktop. Click on the &ldquo;Install Linux Mint&rdquo; icon on the 
desktop. Click the Continue button to proceed onto the next step. Two disk 
partitioning options are available, default and manual. Make sure you use 
Manual, so that we can install it on a Btrfs file system.</p> 
<p>Selecting Manual will pull up the advanced disk partitioning tool. Make 
sure the target disk has been initialized before you create the partitions. 
Select the appropriate disk and click on the New Partition Table button. There 
will now be a free space option on your menu. Select the free space, and then 
click on the Add button so that the first partition can be created.</p> 
<p>The first partition will be mounted at /boot. Make sure it is a Primary 
partition out of the two options. A disk space of 500 MB should be plenty for 
this partition, so go ahead and put 500 MB. Even though we are installing on a 
Btrfs file system, make the boot partition as a Ext4 file system. It will still 
work properly.</p> 
<p>Now that the boot partition has been created, select the remaining free 
space and once again, press the Add button to create the next partition. This 
time this partition is for /, which is the main file system. Instead of 
choosing Primary, choose Logical. The majority of the remaining disk space can 
be put on this file system, leaving only 4 GB for the last partition. Then, 
make sure the btrfs journaling file system option is chosen for this partition. 
Mount point will be set as /. Press ok, and the second partition is finished.
</p> 
<p>Lastly, choose the remaining free space and press Add button. Depending on 
the disk space, allocate 2 to 4 GB for the Swap partition. Make the partition 
type Logical. Finally, use the partition as swap area under the Use as drop 
down menu. Press ok, and the third and last partition is created.</p> 
<p>Double check that all three of these partitions were created properly. If 
the list checks out, click on Install Now. Congratulations, you have now 
installed Linux Mint 12 KDE using the Btrfs file system!</p>

<h2>How to Migrate From Windows to Linux</h2>  Saturday, December 10th, 2011 | 
Learn Linux - Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Mario Pesce</p> 
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> 
<p>When a few years ago I decided to move from Windows to Linux (I created on 
my machine separate partitions for Linux and booted from Lilo or Grub either 
into Windows or into Linux, according to job requirements.</p> 
<p>I normally used my laptop PC during the day in a company that had a Windows 
based LAN and therefore I normally had to boot in Windows during the day 
whereas I would boot into either Windows or Linux at home. This approach has a 
few disadvantages as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>My work e-mails were in Microsoft Outlook and I had to boot under Windows 
to access them.<br>
 I used KMail (and later Mozilla Thundirbird) for my 
personal e-mails and I had to boot under Linux to access them.</li> 
<li>I could access Window folders from Linux and copy data, but I could not 
access any of the Linux folders from Windows.</li> </ul> 
<p>I concluded that there should have been a better way to use my PC and I 
looked for a solution to access both Linux and Windows applications without 
rebooting.</p> 
<p>I investigated some of the available products. I found that the wine or 
CodeWeavers Crossover supported most common Microsoft Windows applications, but 
some other ones would not work. VMWare looked interesting, but finally I 
decided to buy<strong>Win4Lin</strong> (originally developed by Netraverse to 
support only Windows 95, 98 or ME, even if it allowed to install and use many 
more recent applications such as Office 2000 or other ones developed for XP 
without a glitch.</p> 
<p>Some good advantages that I found in Win4Lin are the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Win4Lin has a very small overhead and pretty good performance. I 
discovered, after the installation, that sometimes applications run faster 
under Win4Lin than in the original Windows environment. The performance is due 
to the fact that Win4Lin is not really an emulator; it creates an environment 
where Windows applications run in native mode. This is done by providing 
modules that allow Windows to run as a Linux process.</li> 
<li>The installation of Win4Lin is pretty straightforward.</li> </ul> 
<p>Recently I had to install Linux on a new machine and I decided to install 
both a new OpenSUSE 11.0 distribution and the new version of<strong>Win4LinPro
</strong> that now supports Windows 2000 and XP (according to the company Vista 
should also be supported in future).</p> 
<p>The objective of this report is to give you an overview of the new 
Win4LinPro application and of the approach that I followed to migrate my dual 
boot machine to a single boot system.</p> 
<p><strong>Installing Win4LinPro</strong></p> 
<p>Win4LinPro is now distributed and supported by Virtual Bridges. You can 
easily order it online at the Win4Lin.com site and download either an ISO 
version or one of the Debian or RPM packages. Virtual Bridges confirms the 
order with an e-mail which includes also the licence code that must be entered 
during the installation.</p> 
<p>Since I had an RPM based Linux distribution (OpenSuSE 11.0), I downloaded 
the RPM package. I checked the instructions of the UserManual which require to 
pre-install also the gcc and the kernel-source packages and then I could 
install the RPM without any problems.</p> 
<p>The installation procedure of the original Win4Lin was more complex because 
it required to download a special Netraverse-enabled kernel according to each 
distribution. The new installer does not require this step because it 
automatically compiles and installs the kernel modules needed to support 
Win4LinPro.</p> 
<p>The Windows installation has also become simpler. The original product 
required to copy files from your Windows 95, 98 or ME CD to disk and eventually 
install Windows. In the new version you can use the win4console command to 
request a Windows session installation and to define how it should be performed 
(installation directory, installation media etc.) You can specify that you want 
to install from the XP CD and the installation is performed as if it were a 
normal XP installation. The win4console allows also to install multiple copies 
of Windows and the system allows to run two of them concurrently (this could be 
useful if you want to have a Windows XP and a Windows 2000 session).</p> 
<p>After the installation is complete, if you have used the defaults, you will 
find a Windows icon on your desktop and you can use it to start or shut-down 
your Windows session terminal. Alternatively you can use the win4 shell command.
</p> 
<p>You can install new applications in Windows in the same way as you would do 
with a normal Windows system. I installed various applications such as 
Microsoft Office, Acrobat Reader, Eudora, HotMetal PRO and a new version of 
Internet Explorer without any problem.</p> 
<p>I had some problems with the original installation to use a COM device for 
a dial up connection. The new version allows Windows to connect to almost any 
type of Ethernet network from regular Internet access to Active Directory 
authentication, and anything in between.</p> 
<p><strong>Using Win4LinPro</strong></p> 
<p>Win4LinPro creates an interesting Windows environment which is pretty well 
integrated with Linux.</p> 
<p>The personal Windows environment is normally created by win4LinPro in the 
home directory of the user who performs the installation. When the installation 
is complete, you will find two image files with the .IMG suffix which are used 
by Windows as the C: drive (used to store Windows programs and data) and the D: 
drive (used to store user settings).</p> 
<p>By default Win4LinPro automatically configures shared folders so that 
Windows can access Linux files and Linux can access Windows files. Your Linux 
home directory is accessible from the Windows HOSTHOME path. You can also use 
the shared documents directory from Windows by double clicking on the Windows 
My Documents icon and accessing the path HOSTDocuments.</p> 
<p>The Win4LinPro environment is surely much better integrated with Linux than 
a native Windows installation and you will have at your disposal the power of 
Linux and Windows applications without any need to reboot.</p> 
<p>Moreover Win4LinPro offers greater virus protection than a stand-alone 
Windows installation. You can easily save your Windows directory as a tar 
archive and many viruses will not have any effect as explained below:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Boot sector or other boot time viruses. There is no Windows boot sector 
and therefore they are ineffective.</li> 
<li>FAT32, VFAT or NTFS related viruses. Win4Lin installs Windows files in 
subdirectories of the Linux filesystem and therefore these viruses are 
ineffective.</li> 
<li>Executable files viruses. These can still attack, but will not affect the 
Linux system.</li> 
<li>Macro viruses. These can still attack Windows macros, but you can use 
Linux permissions to make them write protected.</li> </ul> 
<p>Another protection is given by the snapshot running mode which insures that 
data in the C: virtual drive cannot be changed</p> 
<p>Win4Lin Limitations and Peculiarities. Following main points should be 
considered:</p> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Win4Lin offers different networking options that you can choose during 
installation and modify later (if needed). The basic TCP/IP and UDP/IP 
networking is the most secure and provides the best use of resources. If you 
need more advanced networking options you can use the NAT neworking or the 
Bridged networking options well explained in the UserManual.</li> 
<li>Win4LIN does not support direct Windows access to USB devices. However, if 
they are configured in Linux, they can be accessed indirectly (You can use the 
My Host Computer function from the start menu to access devices mounted 
automatically by Linux)</li> </ul> </ul> 
<p>.</p> 
<p><strong>Removing the original Window partition</strong></p> 
<p>One negative point of having both an original Windows partition and the 
Win4Lin installation is the waste of space (for instance I had MS Office 
applications installed on both partitions). This setup could offer better 
security, in case of problems to either the Windows or Linux installation, but, 
at some point, I decided that I could use better the disk space and work 
without double booting with Linux and Windows under Win4LinPro.</p> 
<p>To avoid loosing useful data, I performed following activities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I identified the Outlook mail boxes by using the Windows Find option with 
&ldquo;*.pst&rdquo; and copied them to the Win4LinPro environment.</li> 
<li>I identified the Outlook Express maild boxes by using the Windows Find 
option with &ldquo;*.dbx&rdquo; and copied them to the Win4LinPro environment.
</li> 
<li>I identified my Eudora mail boxes (used for my personal mail) by using the 
Windows Find option with &ldquo;*.mbx&rdquo; and copied them to the Win4LinPro 
environment.</li> 
<li>I found the &lsquo;Favorites&rsquo; folders used by Internet Explorer and 
I copied it and its sub-folders to the Win4LinPro environment.</li> 
<li>I copied the &lsquo;My Documents&rsquo; folder and all other folders that 
I used in my Windows environment</li> </ul> 
<p>Making the above copies in the Win4LinPro environment is relatively easy, 
because Win4LinPro can access mnt directly. You can mount the original Windows 
partition in the Linux /mnt directory by using a command such as:</p> 
<p>$sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /media/windows -t vfat -o umask=000</p> 
<p>Once the partition is mounted, you can access it in the Win4LinPro Windows 
session in the mnt Windows folder.</p> 
<p>Once I was satisfied that all important data existed in the Win4LinPro 
environment, I decided to reformat the Windows partition and copy my Linux 
/home directory, that was included in the main root hierarchy, to a separate 
partition. This activity is described in detail below.</p> 
<p><strong>Using the freed partition for Linux</strong></p> 
<p>A good description of how to move /home to a different partition can be 
found in a good tutorial by Daniel Robbins at IBM DeveloperWorks. The main 
steps are as following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Create a filesystem in the new partition by using a command such as mkfs 
/dev/???</li> 
<li>Mount the new filesystem in /mnt with a command such as mount /dev/??? 
/mnt/newhome</li> 
<li>Drop to single user mode (init 1)</li> 
<li>Change to the current home directory and enter a copy command such as cp 
-ax * /mnt/newhome. The ax option causes cp to copy in recursive mode by 
preserving all file attributes.</li> 
<li>Rename the old /home to /home.old by using the command mv /home /home.old 
and mount the new one with mount /dev/??? /home.</li> </ul> 
<p>When you are sure that everything works correctly, you can remove the 
/home.old directory.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p> 
<p>I believe that the approach described above allows an optimal use of both 
Linux and Windows resources.</p> 
<p>It is often difficult to use only Linux, because one normally has to work 
in Windows based LANs, interact with other Windows or Linux users or just 
because one is too lazy to learn new applications instead of those normally 
used in a Windows environment.</p> 
<p>A double boot system is a inconvenient to use. The solution proposed above 
allows a much better usage of the computer resources and time.</p>

<p>Understanding Linux Partition Types &amp; Linux Hard Disk Partitioning 
&ndash; System Admin Training</p> 
<p>By Clyde E. Boom</p> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re doing Linux disk partitioning (during or after installing 
Linux) you will likely run into situations where you can&rsquo;t create 
partitions &ndash; and can&rsquo;t do other tasks that you&rsquo;d like to do 
with partitions!</p> 
<p>This is when you need to understand the Linux hard disk partitioning 
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; described below.</p> 
<p><strong>Linux System Admin Training Tips: </strong> Keep in mind that the 
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; below apply to using the Linux fdisk command, which is the 
most commonly used disk partitioning utility. You may be able to 
&ldquo;break&rdquo; these rules with other hard disk partitioning utilities.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Setting Up&rdquo; Linux Hard Disk Partitions</strong></p> 
<p>You can &ldquo;set up&rdquo; and configure your Linux partitions while 
using the installation routine of most Linux distributions &ndash; and also by 
using the Linux fdisk and parted commands &ndash; and some other partitioning 
commands.</p> 
<p>Also, as a Linux System Administrator, you will also need to manage 
(create, delete, and modify) partitions on existing Linux systems (after the OS 
has been installed). To do this, you use the fdisk command / utility or the 
parted command / utility &ndash; and there are also other disk partitioning 
commands and utilities.</p> 
<p>There are several Linux hard disk partition &ldquo;types&rdquo;, such as 
primary, extended and logical &ndash; and there are also strict 
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; about using these Linux partition types.</p> 
<p><strong> Linux Primary Partitions</strong></p> 
<p>The disk partitioning utility in a Linux installation routine and the fdisk 
command (and other disk partitioning commands) can create a maximum of four 
Primary partitions per hard disk drive.</p> 
<p>If you need more than four hard disk partitions, you need to create at 
least one Extended partition and then create one or more Logical partitions in 
the Extended partition.</p> 
<p>To be able to create an Extended partition on a hard disk that already has 
four Primary partitions, you need to delete one of the primary Partitions and 
then create the Extended partition. So, you can have a maximum of three Primary 
partitions if you are creating an Extended partition on a Linux hard disk.</p> 
<p><strong> Linux Extended Partitions</strong></p> 
<p>A Linux hard disk must have at least one Primary partition before it can 
have an Exteneded partition.</p> 
<p>fdisk cannot create more than one Extended partition per drive. To be able 
to use the disk space in an Extended partition, it must have at least one 
Logical partition (within the Extended partition).</p> 
<p><strong> Linux Logical Partitions</strong></p> 
<p>Extended partitions contain one or more Logical partitions. An Extended 
partition is not accessed directly. It is accessed via one or more Logical 
partitions within the Extended partition. If a hard disk has an Extended 
partition, then it has at least one Logical partition in that partition.</p> 
<p><strong>Partition Numbering</strong></p> 
<p>The maximum number of Primary partitions that fdisk can create is four and 
the maximum number of Extended partitions that it can create is one.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember, </strong>you must have at least one Primary partition 
before you can have an Extended partition. You can only have one Extended 
partition and the maximum number of the<strong><em>combination</em></strong> of 
Primary and Extended partitions is four.</p> 
<p>The Linux disk partitioning concepts covered here apply to: Debian, Red 
Hat, Fedora, Ubuntu, Slackware, SUSE, openSUSE &ndash; and ALL other Linux 
distributions.</p>

<h2>Linux Training &ndash; Installing Linux on a Windows System</h2>  Tuesday,

<br>

<p>Linux Training &ndash; Installing Linux on a Windows System<br>
 By Clyde 
E. Boom</p> 
<p>The best way to get Linux training and Linux administration experience is 
to start by getting, installing and running Linux on a system. This allows you 
to actually work with Linux to run programs and learn Linux commands.</p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to buy a computer just for the purpose of running 
Linux, you can install Linux on your Windows system. You do this to create what 
is called a &ldquo;dual boot&rdquo; (Linux and Windows) system.</p> 
<p>After you install Linux and boot your system, a menu appears allowing you 
to boot into Windows or boot into Linux!</p> 
<p>7 Steps to Install Linux on Windows and Create a Dual Boot System</p> 
<p>1. Back up your Windows programs and data</p> 
<p>If you make a mistake when you install Linux on Windows you can loose all 
your Windows programs and data! Also, if you install Linux and then remove it 
later, you may not be able to boot into Windows.</p> 
<p>Some people have run dual boot Linux systems without losing programs and 
data, but it&rsquo;s good to know this downside. It&rsquo;s extra incentive to 
do a backup.</p> 
<p>Doing a backup is like buying insurance. If you don&rsquo;t need it, fine. 
But if you do, you&rsquo;ll be very glad you took this extra step.</p> 
<p>2. Get Linux on CD or DVD</p> 
<p>Select a Linux distribution (a.k.a. distro) and either download it and burn 
it to disk or buy it and have it delivered.</p> 
<p>Linux Tip: To get Linux delivered, just do an Internet search for 
&ldquo;linux cd&rdquo; and you can have it mailed to you anywhere in the world 
for a very small fee.</p> 
<p>3. Create empty unpartitioned disk space for Linux</p> 
<p>Make sure your system has enough empty unpartitioned disk space for Linux. 
This isn&rsquo;t just free disk space, as seen from within Windows. This is 
empty disk space that isn&rsquo;t seen from within Windows.</p> 
<p>4. Document your Linux installation settings</p> 
<p>During the Linux installation, you need to specify some system settings. 
These include the Linux software programs and desktop(s) you want installed, 
networking settings, and disk partition sizes.</p> 
<p>5. Start the Linux installation routine</p> 
<p>To start installing Linux, you need to shut down your system and boot it 
with Linux CD / DVD number 1.</p> 
<p>Some systems are set up to automatically boot from a CD / DVD if 
there&rsquo;s one in the drive, and some need to have a system setting made. On 
other systems, you may simply need to hold down a key, like the letter 
&ldquo;c&rdquo; to boot Linux from CD / DVD.</p> 
<p>6. Follow the prompts to specify settings and create a user</p> 
<p>Linux systems have users and these users have names. You log in with a user 
name and password to work on a Linux system.</p> 
<p>You work as the user named &ldquo;root&rdquo; to do Linux system 
administration. The root user is always created automatically during the 
installation. However, for security reasons, you should never log in to a Linux 
desktop as the root user.</p> 
<p>As the installation routine runs, you will be asked if you want to create 
users. Always create at least one &ldquo;regular&rdquo; (non- root) user and 
give this user a password.</p> 
<p>7. Have fun!</p> 
<p>The Linux operating system is an incredible phenomenon. By getting it, 
installing it, and running it, you can get tons of experience working with it. 
Get a mitt and get in the game!</p>

<h2>Beginners Under Gnu &ndash; Linux? There Are Five Errors to Be Avoided</h2>
 Saturday, October 3rd, 2009 |Learn Linux - Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Beginners Under Gnu &ndash; Linux? There Are Five Errors to Be Avoided<br>
 
ByDidier Pradel</p> 
<p>To give the desire for testing linux so that it is one day your operating 
system, is one of the objectives of this site. The new users of GNU/Linux often 
make the same errors when they test GNU/Linux for the first time. The reasons 
of these errors are numerous: because GNU/Linux is a different OS; because 
Windows gives bad habits; because the user chooses the bad distribution and 
much of other possibilities. Here some solutions with five current problems 
under GNU/Linux.</p> 
<h2>1- To choose its distribution:</h2> 
<p>There is much opinion on the GNU/Linux distribution with which you will 
have to start, and the majority are not relevant.</p> 
<p>After having to seek, to study, read the opinions of users, with the wire 
of time, on many distributions, two points arise:</p> 
<p>the first: GNU/Linux Bureau is a question of taste,</p> 
<p>the second: not a distribution does not join together the whole of the best 
options.</p> 
<p>For start with GNU/Linux, it is to advise to choose among the following 
distributions, withoutorder:</p> 
<p>Professional SUSE and, in the future, openSUSE</p> 
<p>Linspire Xandros</p> 
<p>Fedora Core</p> 
<p>Mandriva (in the past Mandrake)</p> 
<p>Ubuntu</p> 
<h2>2- Is Linux free?</h2> 
<p>Some claim that all that is related to Linux is free. A good software 
deserves that one pays for him it is obvious, but the price must be reasonable 
the majority of the commercial distributions GNU/Linux for the office costs 
less than $100 and is really very rich. The term distribution meaning that a 
great number of software are gathered they also contain thousands of 
applications for the office. The commercial distributions GNU/Linux include 
word processing softwares, P2P, spreadsheet, presentation on transparency, 
edition file sharing of video, binary compatibility with Windows, virtual 
machine, reading of DVD, Web server, Web navigator, and much of others.</p> 
<h2>3- The partitions:</h2> 
<p>With Windows, you are accustomed to only one partition on your hard disk. 
It contains the operating system, the applications, the data, and a great space 
for your file of Windows exchange (the software uses space on the hard disk 
when the read-write memory is not enough any more). GNU/Linux functions 
differently. In order to obtain the best performances of the system, the file 
of exchange is on a separate partition. If you have 512 MB or 1GB of read-write 
memory the size the partition of exchange (swap) should not be lower than 512 
MB, and not lower than 1GB if you have less than 512 MB of read-write memory.
</p> 
<p>It is useless to make a larger partition if you use your machine only for 
office automation applications. With this solution you can safeguard the 
remainder of your personal and software data on a second partition. It is a 
good solution if you never change hard disk or operating system. But if you 
wish to preserve your data and the preferences of the applications which you 
use, it is to better do two other partitions for the operating system, the 
other for your data and your adjustments. that thus gives 1 partition root 
&ldquo;/&rdquo;, 2 partition &ldquo;/home&rdquo;. 3 swap the size depends on 
the number of software which you install, but 20 GB are more than sufficient 
for the partition root &ldquo;/&rdquo;root, the largest part of your disc must 
be to hold has&rdquo; /home &ldquo;, because it is there that you will store 
images, films, and other large files. It is wise to give 75% of the total disk 
space to the repertory /home, the majority of the GNU/Linux distributions can 
make the partitions for you, but they have all various ideas on the number of 
partitions to create and their size. you must decide if you want to change the 
default values. You can preserve your Windows partition and thanks to the 
dual-boot to choose to start your computer either under Windows or under 
GNU/Linux. You must install Windows in first to make only one partition but not 
too large not to obstruct the installation of GNU/Linux after. And if you want 
to exchange files between the Windows partition and the GNU/Linux partition, 
use the filing system FAT32 to format your Windows partition (Window does not 
read the partition linux and linux does not read partitions NTFS whereas it can 
read and write easily on a system FAT32).</p> 
<h2>4- The Permissions:</h2> 
<p>With Windows, you are in general either an administrator, or a user with 
the rights of administrator. With GNU/Linux, you are in general connect as a 
user to restricted access, and you pass as a root (i.e. administrator under 
Windows) when you must change important parameters of the system or regulate 
the hardware configuration or add or remove a program. This organization based 
on the permissions makes your system protected and one is accustomed quickly, 
although that is strange at the beginning.</p> 
<h2>5- To give up with the first problems:</h2> 
<p>GNU/linux is not Windows thus you enter a new world with new rules. To 
learn has to evolve/move in this new world will take time, it is normal. It 
will be necessary to learn from new software, a new interface, with a new 
manner of making. but once passed this stage hardest is made. The community the 
forums are sources of support as well as the site of your distribution if you 
chose a distribution commercial. To learn an operating system is a challenge. 
Essayer Linux is not in fact so hard and a thing is sure in any case: more you 
are frustrated with Windows and its problems, more the transition to GNU/Linux 
will be easy. Good luck! Those which want to install linux on a laptop will

already done.</p>

<h2>Dual booting Linux and Windows</h2>  Monday, May 11th, 2009 | Arizona Linux
 |No Comments <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Multi boot</strong> or <strong>Multi booting</strong> (usually 
<strong>dual booting</strong>, but many OSes can be booted from the same 
computer) is the act of installing multiple operating systems on a computer, 
and being able to choose which one to boot when switching on the computer 
power. The program which makes multi booting possible is called a boot loader.
</p> 
<p>Multi booting is useful in many situations, such as those where several 
pieces of software require different operating systems and cannot be run on a 
single system. A multi boot configuration will allow a user to use all of this 
software on one computer. Another reason for setting up a multi boot system can 
be that one wants to investigate or test a new operating system without 
switching completely. Multi booting allows one to get to know the new system, 
configure all applications needed and migrate data before making the final step 
and removing the old operating system. This is often accomplished by using a 
boot loader that can boot more than one operating system, such as NTLDR, LILO, 
or GRUB.</p> 
<p>Multi booting can also aid software developers where multiple operating 
systems are required for development or testing purposes. Having these systems 
on one machine can greatly reduce hardware costs. (However hardware costs are 
counterbalanced by system management costs, and the costs of the unavailability 
of the software that cannot be run at any given moment. Another solution to 
these problems is to use virtual machine software to emulate another computer 
from within the operating system of choice.)</p> 
<p>A popular multi-boot configuration is a mixed-OS system in which Linux is 
one of the secondary (or primary) installations. In terms of business strategy, 
Windows does not facilitate or support multi-boot systems, other than allowing 
for partition-specific installations, and no choice ofboot loader is offered. 
To deal with such installs requires consultation with Linux afficionados and 
techs, who are typically well-versed in the concept.</p> 
<p>The basic concept involves partitioning a disk, to accommodate each planned 
installation, including separate partitions for data storage or backups. The 
partitions should be done with a Windows partitioning tool (diskpart,Disk 
Management), rather than a Linux tool (parted, QTparted), for the simple reason 
that Windows is more particular (cf. &ldquo;picky&rdquo;) about how the 
partition table is written and will occasionally complain or even show errors 
if its installed to a Linux-created (or sometimes modified) partition table. 
Linux tools are powerful, (ie. shrinking an NTFS drive) but Windows has 
particularities which must be considered. (See master boot record and extended 
boot record).</p> 
<p>Windows should be installed to the first primary drive. Though Windows can 
be installed to another drive, certain particularities (drive letter 
assignments, expected system partition number) can make such installations 
problematic, while Linux installations on primary or logical drives have no 
such problems whatsoever.</p> 
<p>The boot manager/loader should be installed by the Linux distribution. All 
Windows installations will be easily found by Linux, but Windows boot managers 
do not find Linux installations (nor does Windows deal natively with Linuxfile 
systems).</p>
