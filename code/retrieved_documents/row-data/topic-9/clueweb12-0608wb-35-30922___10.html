<h1>Why Is the Internet So Slow?</h1> 
<p>A recent story on the BBC reported that Virgin Media will beat British 
Telecom to the marketplace with 100Mbps broadband speeds. Virgin plans to start 
rolling out its fiber network next year and will complete the process by 2012. 
Until then, the Brits will just have to make do with a top speed of 50Mbps. 
Make do? Every time I begin to feel good about my 6Mbps download speed, I run 
across a story about a service that's more than 8 times faster than what I 
have. In Japan, 60Mbps service is available today. And it costs about what I 
pay for far slower service. Why?</p> 
<p>In part, it's because the Federal Communications Commission has, for nearly 
a decade, failed to do what it's supposed to do. Instead of promoting 
technology, the FCC was in a continuous tizzy about the occasional dirty word 
or &quot;costume malfunction&quot;. But that's not the sole cause of the 
problem. In part, it's because the United States is so large.</p> 
<p>The <em>CIA Fact Book</em> lists the 5 largest countries in the world, by 
land mass: Russia, Canada, U.S., China, and Brazil. Sorting the list for the 
largest countries by population, a different picture emerges: China, India, 
U.S., Indonesia, and Brazil. But neither of these views provides a clear 
picture that shows why high-speed Internet and cellular service takes so long 
to build out here compared to places such as Japan.</p> 
<p>The real story is population density and sorting the list that way produces 
a far different picture. This time I'll list the top 10 countries because a few 
in the top 10 are so small that they can be ignored for the purposes of this 
story: Macau, Monaco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Gibraltar, Malta, Bermuda, 
Maldives, Bahrain, and Bangladesh.</p> 
<p>Take Hong Kong for example, third on the list. Hong Kong Broadband Network 
Limited reaches more than 90% of homes in Hong Kong and its slow speed is 
25Mbps. Speeds up to 1000Mbps are available. Even a country that we in the West 
think of as &quot;poor&quot;, Bangladesh, has Internet service providers that 
provide download speeds of just under 1Mbps. You might be wondering where the 
U.S. is on that list. We're number 175.</p> 
<p>Clearly population density isn't the entire story. A poor nation with a 
high population density won't see high-speed Internet service anytime soon. But 
a reasonably prosperous nation that has a relatively high population density 
provides conditions that are ideal to support widespread high-speed service.</p>
<p>Fiber is costly to deploy and if the population density hovers around 2 
people per square mile, as in Mongolia, there's little incentive to install 
fiber. On the other hand, Taiwan (600+ people per square mile), South Korea 
(490), Japan (336), Great Britain and Germany (each around 240), and 
Switzerland (180) have the investment capital and the population density to 
support a fast build-out.</p> 
<p>China is far higher on the list than the United States, too, 76th with a 
density of just over 130 compared to the U.S. in 175th place with a density 
less than 30. It's true that about 80% of us live in metro areas, though, and 
it's unlikely that someone who lives on Beer Can Alley, about 5 miles north of 
Wolf Point, Montana, expects high-speed service anytime soon.</p> 
<p>You might be wondering about the source of all those wonderful spams that 
offer to send you millions of dollars in cash. Nigeria is 73rd by population 
density with about 141 people per square mile. Those who can afford Internet 
access in Nigeria are largely limited to speeds of 300 to 500Kbps according to 
Speedtest.net. That's still 6 to 10 times the speed of modem-based Internet 
service.</p> 
<h2>For the Residents of Beer Can Alley*</h2> 
<p>*I just liked the name of the road. Actually, it appears that nobody lives 
on Beer Can Alley. Google Maps shows nothing more than farm fields north and 
south of the road. But somebody might build a house there someday.</p> 
<p>If you live in northeast Montana (or just about anywhere else in the 
country) you can have &quot;high-speed&quot; Internet access if you're willing 
to use a satellite service. I took a look at HughesNet Satellite. The company 
has 6 tiers of service:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Home - 1.0 Mbps Downstream / 128 Kbps Upstream / $59.99 Monthly: That's 
about 20 times the speed of a modem connection for about 3 times the cost of 
modem service.</li> 
<li>Pro - 1.2 Mbps Downstream / 200 Kbps Upstream / $69.99 Monthly</li> 
<li> ProPlus - 1.6 Mbps Downstream / 250 Kbps Upstream / $79.99 Monthly: These 
two services provide a slight increase in the downlink speed, but the primary 
advantage is the faster uplink, which is helpful if you need to upload files.
</li> 
<li>Elite - 2.0 Mbps Downstream / 300 Kbps Upstream / $119.99 Monthly</li> 
<li> ElitePlus - 3.0 Mbps Downstream / 300 Kbps Upstream / $189.99 Monthly</li>
<li> ElitePremium - 5.0 Mbps Downstream / 300 Kbps Upstream / $349.99 Monthly: 
These are speeds that a cable or DSL subscriber would pay $40 to $60 per month 
for.</li> </ul>

<p>For those who live in or near to cities, where houses are close together, 
fiber could be built out relatively fast. In many cases, fiber is already in 
the neighborhood. All that's needed is the time, money, and effort required to 
run fiber from a utility pole to and through your home.</p> 
<p>As for the guy who might someday build a house on Beer Can Alley: Don't 
hold your breath.</p> 
<p>To see the spreadsheet I used to compare land mass, population, and 
population density, download thisExcel 2007 file. If you have Excel 2003, you 
will need to download theMicrosoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, 
and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats.</p> 
<h1>Linux Might Win</h1> 
<p>If Linux is the Answer, What's the Question? I said last week that Linux 
won't win the fight for the desktop. I mentioned, among other things, a lack of 
Linux administrators in the corporate world, fear of the unknown, and a general 
inability to run Windows applications. During a week of vacation in March, I 
was able to work for long periods on several days with my primary computer 
running Linux. I still can't realistically see a time when Linux will be the 
king of the desktop, but I know for certain that Linux does most of the tasks 
needed by a large number of computer users. Maybe it's time to take a look at 
some of the Linux advantages.</p> 
<p><strong>Cost Advantage:</strong> Linux is free. Part of the cost of a 
computer is the operating system and Windows adds about $200 to the cost of the 
hardware. That's not a lot if you're buying a high-end computer, but it's quite 
a bit if you're looking for a computer in the sub-$500 range. Eliminating the 
cost of the operating system would allow the buyer to reduce the price or to 
obtain better hardware at the same cost.</p> 
<p><strong>Performance Advantage:</strong> Linux can generally do more with 
less hardware. It will happily use large amounts of memory and high-power video 
cards, but Linux manages to get along better than Windows does on low-power 
machines. You'll also probably find that Linux starts and shuts down faster 
than Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>Reliability Advantage:</strong> Recently, when Windows lost track 
of both DVD drives in my computer, I was able to determine that the problem 
wasn't a hardware failure by booting Linux and allowing it to confirm that the 
drives were working. (Story below.) The problem turned out to be a Registry 
problem. Linux doesn't store all of the important configuration information in 
a single gigantic (and easily corrupted) file as Windows does.</p> 
<p><strong>Security Advantage (sometimes):</strong> Some Linux distributions 
take security more seriously than others, but generally speaking Linux and Unix 
machines have been more secure than Windows. Vista's security is good, although 
cumbersome, and Windows 7 will probably be better. Still, because Linux is 
based on Unix, the directory structure was designed from the beginning with 
security in mind.</p> 
<p><strong>Robustness Advantage:</strong> I mentioned the Windows Registry, 
which is one of the reasons that performance degrades over time when outdated 
entries build up. Windows users who routinely add and remove software usually 
need to reinstall the operating system occasionally. This is rarely done with 
Linux.</p> 
<p><strong>Disk Advantage:</strong> Because of the way Windows writes to hard 
drives, files become fragmented. This reduces performance and the only solution 
is to run a defragmentation program. Linux takes a different approach to 
writing files and, as a result, fragmentation is far less likely to occur until 
the disk drive is nearly full.</p> 
<p><strong>Sharing Advantage:</strong> It's a common misconception that Linux 
can't write to Windows NTFS volumes. It can. As I wrote this report in a text 
editor under Linux, I saved the document to 
&quot;/media/Data/WEBSITES/TechByter.com/_development/TechByter pending&quot;, 
a directory on an NTFS volume on drive D. Linux doesn't use drive letter 
designations, but it can mount the volume as well as read and write files. I 
wouldn't need that, of course, if the computer had only Linux installed.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu classifies software into 4 categories: <strong>Main</strong> 
(officially supported software),<strong>Restricted</strong> (supported software 
that is not available under a free license),<strong>Universe</strong> 
(community maintained software that is not supported by Ubuntu), and<strong>
Multiverse</strong> (software that is not free).</p> 
<p><strong>One-Stop-Shopping Advantage:</strong> When you're looking for an 
application, and particularly if you're using one of the more consumer-oriented 
distributions (&quot;distros&quot; in Linux-speak), adding an application is as 
easy as selecting Add Programs from a menu and picking the applications you 
want from a list that's divided into categories (utilities, programming, 
office, games, and such). Select as few or as many as you want and tell Linux 
to start. The operating system locates all of the applications, downloads them, 
installs them, and sets them up on the menu. It doesn't get any easier than 
this.</p> 
<p><strong>Updating Advantage:</strong> Similar to the previous point, 
updating is a snap. If you have used the distro's installer, it will track 
updates to applications as well as updates to the operating system. You'll be 
notified when there are updates and obtaining them consists of a single click 
that instructs the updater to get to work, along with typing the password 
required for administrator tasks.</p> 
<p>For every advantage, there is probably a disadvantage, but I covered those 
in the other article. If you need a computer, but you don't require any 
Windows-specific or Mac-specific applications, maybe it would be worth your 
time to consider Linux.</p> 
<h1>The Mysterious Case of the Missing DVD Drives</h1> 
<p>Sometimes things aren't where you left them. If I leave a cat on the bed, 
there's a pretty good chance he'll still be there when I return unless he 
suspects that he might be able to obtain food or catnip. And even then, he'll 
probably return. I'm fairly good about remembering where I put my glasses or 
the car keys. Sometimes I do have to call the cell phone to find it. But DVD 
drives that are installed in a computer should always be there. One day, they 
weren't. Physically they were there. I could see them, but Windows couldn't. 
That made using them somewhat difficult.</p> 
<p>Click any of the images here for a full-size view.</p> 
<p>The first step is both easy and obvious: Power connectors are notorious for 
becoming detached, so I press the button that opens the tray on each drive. 
Both opened. They're getting power. The data cable could have become loose, but 
data cables are firmly attached and, besides, two of them would have to have 
come unplugged at the same time. Possible, but not worth opening the case for 
just yet.</p> 
<p>I plugged in an external USB DVD drive, but the USB device detector had a 
problem with it, too.</p> 
<p>The Windows Device Manager showed the USB drive and the 2 internal drives 
as having problems.</p> 
<p>This should be an easy fix. The usual procedure is to delete the devices 
and then either restart the computer or have the Device Manager scan for new 
devices.</p> 
<p>Nothing doing. No matter what I did, the two DVD drives simply weren't 
present. It could be the result of a hardware problem. Both DVD drives should 
use the same part of the main board, so the problem could be there.</p> 
<p>But I thought I'd try performing a system restore to see if that would 
resolve the problem. After all, both drives had been working less than 24 hours 
earlier.</p> 
<p>As is usually the case with System Restore, the process acted as if it 
would work, but ultimately failed. So I still don't know if I'm looking for a 
hardware problem or a software problem.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Linux to the Rescue</h2> 
<p>Because the computer is a dual-boot machine, I could conclusively rule out 
either hardware or software by booting to Linux. If Linux could see the drives, 
the problem would be a Windows issue. If Linux couldn't see the drives, the 
problem would be entirely hardware related.</p> 
<p>Linux could see the drives. Both of them. And it could play a DVD movie. So 
that meant the problem was Windows. And probably the Registry.</p> 
<p>The Registry is nearly 180MB on my computer. There's no way that I could 
ever hope to scroll through there, line by line, with any hope of finding the 
problem. So I turned to Google. That's my usual procedure, even if I think it's 
a Windows problem. Instead of searching Microsoft's Knowledgebase, I start with 
Google. The knowledgebase articles are all indexed, but often I'll find better 
descriptions of the problem and possible resolutions elsewhere.</p> 
<p>About halfway down the first page of results, there was a Microsoft 
Knowledgebase article that looked promising.</p> 
<blockquote> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060: Microsoft Windows XP <br>

 1. Click Start, and then click Run.<br>
 2. In the Open box, type regedit, and 
then click OK.<br>
 3. In the navigation pane, locate and then click the 
following registry subkey:<br>
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
<br> 4. In the right pane, click UpperFilters. <br>
 Note You may also see an 
UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click 
UpperFilters only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still 
might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to step 7.
<br> 5. On the Edit menu, click Delete. <br>
 6. When you are prompted to 
confirm the deletion, click Yes.<br>
 7. In the right pane, click LowerFilters. 
<br> Note If you do not see the LowerFilters registry entry, unfortunately this 
content cannot help you any further. Go to the &quot;Next Steps&quot; section 
for information about how you can find more solutions or more help on the 
Microsoft Web site.<br>
 8. On the Edit menu, click Delete. <br>
 9. When you 
are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.<br>
 10. Exit Registry Editor. 
<br> 11. Restart the computer. </blockquote> 
<p>So the good news is that Microsoft knows about this problem, even if I've 
never heard of it. I found the Registry subkey and deleted the two entries. 
When I restarted the computer, the DVD drives were home again.</p> 
<h2>And My Point Is ... ?</h2> 
<p>My point is that this isn't (as a friend of mine like to say) &quot;rocket 
surgery&quot;. The first thing to do is remain calm. Ask anyone who's been 
trained by the Red Cross what the first order of business is and you'll 
probably be told that you should be part of the solution, not part of the 
problem.</p> 
<p>I could have yanked off the side of the case and started moving wires 
around and, at best, that would have produced no change. I could have decided 
that the only solution would be to reinstall Windows; that would have solved 
the problem, but at the cost of several days of lost productivity.</p> 
<p>Think things through. Use the resources available to you. Being able to 
boot the system to Linux and see the drives told me that I would have been 
foolish to have cracked open the case. Once I knew the problem was related 
entirely to Windows, Google became an ally.</p> 
<p>But sometimes a Google search can lead you to something that's 
&quot;almost&quot; like what you're experiencing. There's a great temptation to 
do something (anything!) to fix the problem. For those of us who aren't 
terribly patient, this is a dangerous juncture. Before taking action to solve 
the problem, it's a good idea to make sure that the problem you're solving is 
the one that has presented itself. If you don't, you're in danger of creating a 
solution that only makes the problem worse than it was.</p> 
<h1>Short Circuits</h1> 
<h2>Sun Slides Behind an Oracle</h2> 
<p>Things haven't been so bright for Sun lately. The company that pioneered 
graphics-intensive terminals has seen basic desktop computers' power increase 
to the point that machines costing a small fraction of a Sun Workstation could 
perform virtually the same tasks. IBM considered acquiring Sun, but antitrust 
concerns got in the way. So now Sun will be acquired by Oracle. I'm still 
trying to figure out who wins and who loses, so any commentary will have to 
wait for a later time, but I can talk about the acquisition. Well, maybe just 
one comment. I'm sorry to see Scott McNealy's company by gobbled up by Larry 
Ellison's Oracle. Oracle will acquire Sun for $7.4 billion.</p> 
<p>It was 1982 when 4 Silicon Valley wizards created a new class of 
&quot;inexpensive&quot; workstations that could do what once required mainframe 
machines or at least minicomputers. But the relentless march of hardware turned 
today's desktop systems into yesterday's supercomputers.</p> 
<p>The name &quot;Sun&quot; was a nod to the &quot;Stanford University 
Network&quot;, founded by McNealy and 2 other Stanford grad students and UC 
Berkeley software engineer Bill Joy, a Unix guru. Sun workstations were able to 
create graphics that until then had required much more powerful systems. Sun 
servers powered much of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, but the dot-com 
crash was the end of the company's prominence.</p> 
<p>In recent years, Sun acquired the German StarDivision's Office Suite and 
renamed it Star Suite. Development of Star Suite is now an open-source project 
known as Open Office. Sun released the source code on condition that it could 
use improvements developed by the open-source community.</p> 
<p>McNealy remained chairman in 2006 when Jonathan Schwartz became Sun's CEO. 
Sun and IBM discussed a merger for several months, but IBM called off the 
chase, which gave an opening to Oracle.</p> 
<h2>Bill Gates is Right!</h2> 
<p>For years, Bill Gates said that Microsoft couldn't continue its record 
quarter-over-quarter growth. But for years (23 years, if you want to be exact) 
Microsoft recorded gains. For the first time, sales have dropped year-over-year.
</p> 
<p>Revenue fell 6% in the quarter that ended March 31. And Microsoft failed to 
meet analysts' estimates. The company was expected to earn 39 cents per share, 
but the final results were $3.0 billion of net income, which is 33 cents a 
share. Year-over-year profits dropped from $4.4 billion last year.</p> 
<p>The personal computer industry has been hit hard by the recession. Business 
and home purchases are down sharply. Making things worse is a decision by a lot 
of people to wait for Windows 7 to be released. Intel says it expects sales to 
increase soon and that would mean gains for Microsoft. Intel says it's begun to 
see larger orders from manufacturers, so there are indications that the 
situation may improve.</p> 
<h2>Jaunty Jackalope Hops onto Computers Worldwide</h2> 
<p>If you're an Ubuntu Linux fan, you already know this. Version 9.04 of 
Ubuntu Linux was released this week as an update to version 8.10. Canonical 
released 9.04 on Thursday, April 23, and I'm writing this as the 618MB update 
is downloading. In all, 10 packages will be removed, 104 will be installed, and 
993 will be upgraded. It's all automatic.</p> 
<p>The expected download time was shown as just shy of 2 hours, but the actual 
time will be closer to 5 hours. Part of this is because the Ubuntu FTP servers 
are clearly swamped on this first day to download the new version. But I also 
had in process a 2GB backup procedure that sends files to Carbonite. 
Simultaneous big uploads and big downloads don't work very well. When I shut 
down the Carbonite process, the download speed increased to about 80Kbps, which 
is clearly the result of an overload on the Canonical side. I could easily 
handle 10 times that speed, which would reduce the download time to the 
expected 2 hours.</p> 
<p>The new release is available for netbook computers. It contains a preview 
edition of Eucalyptus, which is an open-source project from the University of 
California (Santa Barbara). Eucalyptus makes it possible for organizations to 
build their own in-house Amazon-like EC2-compute clouds.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu 9.04 can work acceptably in both desktop and server roles, but it's 
far less robust as a server OS than as a desktop OS. If you're concerned about 
the breakneck speed of Ubuntu releases (8.10 was released just 6 months ago and 
9.10 will be out 6 months hence) you could consider 8.04, which comes with 
long-term support.</p>
