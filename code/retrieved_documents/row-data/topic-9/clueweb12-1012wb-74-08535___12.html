<p> This article was originally a wiki, at win4.leenooks.com. After many 
months of very few updates, and a lot of spam, I decided to commit the 
accumulated wisdom to an article. If you have any corrections or additions, 
please email them to me.</p> 
<p> <strong> A big thanks to everyone who contributed to the wiki over the 
past couple of years!</strong> </p> 
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p> I have been fortunate to have used Linux exclusively for the past 10 years 
or so, very rarely utilizing Microsoft Windows. Several years ago, I acquired 
several clients that absolutely needed work done on the windows platform, so I 
had to bite the bullet and dive in. It has mostly been as unpleasant as I 
imagined, and I've had to struggle a lot, starting from the installation 
onwards.</p> 
<p> I created the original wiki in order to share some of the things I 
learned. It is meant as a guide to windows for Linux users who are struggling 
like I was to be productive with an unfamiliar system. Given the relative 
popularity of windows and Linux, I don't expect that there are that many of us, 
but perhaps that's changing these days.</p> 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
<p> I found the Windows XP installation process to be slower and far less 
flexible than a recent Ubuntu install. Frankly, the Ubuntu text based installer 
is visually better too, in that it gives me an idea of what's going on. There 
are several ways of approaching the installation problem, depending on what you 
need to accomplish:</p> 
<h3>Windows on a second hard drive</h3> 
<p> This is what I did, and it was difficult. Most advice on the web seems to 
indicate that you are better off installing windows first, on the 
primary/master hard drive, and then installing Linux elsewhere, because the 
windows install is not terribly intelligent and doesn't give you the 
flexibility to move things around as you see fit.</p> 
<p> Given that I already had Linux installed, and wanted to put Windows on the 
slave HD, I managed to get things working by</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Unplugging the Linux HD.</li> 
<li>Installing Windows on the secondary HD.</li> 
<li>Adding the following magic to grub:</li> </ol> 
<pre> title Windows XP map (hd0) (hd1) map (hd1) (hd0) root (hd1,0) makeactive 
chainloader +1</pre> 
<p> Which makes things work ok. Under Linux, I can see the windows partion as 
<code>/dev/hdb1/</code></p> 
<h3>VMware</h3> 
<p> This is probably the best approach, because you can very quickly swap in 
and out of Windows. Drawbacks: you need a lot of memory to make it work, and 
VMware isn't cheap. Since I didn't opt for this route, I don't have any 
instructions, but I'm sure that plenty of people have accomplished this without 
problems.</p> 
<h3>Qemu</h3> 
<p> This is an alternative to VMWare and is getting to be quite advanced if 
you add the 'accelerator' download to it it's very fast.</p> 
<h3>Linux On Windows</h3> 
<p> This might be a suitable alternative in some cases - if you're stuck with 
windows and want to use Linux from time to time, for instance. I don't have 
much information beyond the idea of using VMWare on Windows to host Linux.</p> 
<h3>Windows on a separate machine</h3> 
<p> Dan O'Huiginn writes to suggest running Windows on a separate machine and 
connecting to it viardesktop. That way you don't have to worry about the memory 
and CPU requirements for having two OS's running at the same time, but can 
still use both at once. The downside is that latency can be a bit higher, 
meaning it's not a good way to watch movies, for instance. If you don't have a 
spare computer, you could even use a service likeFlexiscale on a pay-as-you-go 
basis, if you don't need Windows that often.</p> 
<h2>Tools</h2> 
<p> If you're a programmer like I am, you spend all your time working through 
your tools - editors, compilers, scripts, and things of that ilk. What's out 
there on windows?</p> 
<h3>cygwin</h3> 
<p> The first thing you need to get, of course, is cygwin This includes tons 
of useful ports of Unix software to windows including bash (no cmd.exe for me, 
thanks!), ssh, grep, ps, and all your favorites.</p> 
<h3>GnuWin32</h3> GnuWin32 provides Win32 (MS Windows 95 / 98 / ME / NT / 2000 
/ XP) ports of tools with a GNU or similar open source license. Useful if you 
use Windows command prompt and want a minimal and non-invasive way to have 
find, grep, sed, tail available or just to stop typing &quot;ls&quot; and get 
&quot;command not found&quot; error messages.
<h3>UnxUtils</h3> 
<p>UnxUtils is another port of common tools. These are all native binaries, 
with no dependence upon any of the cygwin DLL's, so they are a nice 
alternative. The collection also includes some additional utilities for 
clipboard access.</p> 
<h3>xemacs</h3> 
<p> Ok, ok, so I'm an emacs junkie! I normally use GNU Emacs, but Xemacs seems 
much faster to get working on windows in that it has a windows installer. 
Compare the instructionshere for installing GNU Emacs, with the simple 'Install 
Now!' athttp://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html. </p> 
<h3>vi</h3> 
<p> Those of you who prefer hitting the esc key all the time instead of 
ctrl-alt-meta-shit can downloadCream and install. This will give you Vim plus a 
bunch of plugins. Since Cream uses Windows-esque keybindings by default, you 
can share it with cow-orkers who can't use a real editor, while you can either 
change the default keybindings (it's even a menu option) back to vi, or simply 
run the included Vim without the Cream plugins. Best of both worlds.</p> 
<p> Another alternative is to install just VIM for Windows, which is just your 
regular VIM (with no Windows flavor) at it's latest version (Windows Cream 
usually lags a bit behind the latest VIM version).</p> 
<h3>Eclipse</h3> 
<p> Eclipse is an IDE platform. Since it also runs on Linux you may have heard 
of it. It has good native support for Java, C and C++ development and CVS, and 
with free plugins you also get Python, PHP, and Subversion, so in reality it 
does a lot more than Java these days. Of course, it also takes something like a 
gig of memory to get started, so be forewarned...</p> 
<h3>Perl Shell</h3> 
<p> The Perl Shell (psh) combines aspects of bash and other shells with the 
power of Perl scripting. It aspires to be your primary login shell. This is a 
production quality shell, and there is a native windows port.</p> 
<h3>Subversion</h3> 
<p> Every developer needs revision control. Subversion runs natively and you 
can get plugins forWindows Explorer, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. </p> 
<h3>SSH client</h3> 
<p>PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 and Unix 
platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator. It provides also command line 
file transfer clients and ssh-agent.</p> 
<h3>Network Analyzer</h3> 
<p> If you're writing network applications, or need to support them, a network 
analysis tool can be very helpful in quickly getting to the root of problems.
Ethereal is such a tool and is licensed under the GPL. It can read capture 
files from many other analysis tools, making it a one-stop-tool for commercial 
network helpdesks. Also of note is the 'Follow TCP Stream' option to 
reconstruct a session starting with only a single packet from the stream. 
Ethereal also (optionally) performs colour highlighting of packets. By default, 
it will do this for TCP packets based on state. Ethereal does seem to have more 
than its fair share of security vulnerabilities, so take care to keep it 
up-to-date.</p> 
<h2>Environment</h2> 
<p> As someone who has very specific ideas about what my window manager and 
environment should be like under Linux, Windows is a painful experience. This 
page discusses tools and tips to make life a little bit easier and more 
productive.</p> 
<h3>Focus follows mouse and X11 Cut'n'Paste</h3> 
<p> I am used to having the focus follow the mouse, instead of clicking hither 
and yon to activate different windows. I also vastly prefer the X11 style mouse 
left button/ middle button combination for copy and paste operations. I found 
this program to be quite helpful: &quot;True X-Mouse Gizmo&quot;:
http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/nt/TXMouse/ </p> 
<h3>Virtual Desktop Manager</h3> 
<p> I like having multiple desktops. Microsoft themselves provide a virtual 
desktop manager here:
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx 
although I would like it even more if I could use alt + arrow keys to navigate 
between the different desktops, like I do in Linux. An alternative to 
Microsoft's Virtual Desktop Manager isVirtuaWin. VirtuaWin is licensed under 
the GPL and is modular. Recommended modules include 'VWAssigner', 'Win32WM' 
(which allows X-style ALT+mouse moving/resizing of windows) and WinList.</p> 
<h3>X</h3> 
<p> In cygwin, if you've installed the X portion of the system, you can simply 
run<code>startx</code> and get X programs like xterm (which is much nicer than 
the clunky windows terminal screens).</p> 
<h3>Tab completion at command prompt</h3> 
<p> Tab completion is enabled by default in Windows XP but if you are running 
an older release you can enable it as explained in thisarticle. </p> 
<h3>Emacs Keys for input fields,... in all windows programs</h3> 
<p> XKeymacs allows you to enable Emacs Keys in all Windows Applications. It 
is configurable on a per-application per-key basis so if one key makes problems 
in that application you can disable it and if the whole program doesn't work 
right with a specific app you can still use it for all the others you are 
running.</p> 
<h3>Misc. registry patches</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Maps Caps Lock to left ctrl:<br>

<pre> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlKeyboard Layout] 
&quot;Scancode 
Map&quot;=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00</pre> 
</li> 
<li>Use google as Internet explorer search assistant:<br>

<pre> REGEDIT4 [HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMain] 
&quot;Use Search Asst&quot;=&quot;no&quot; &quot;Search 
Page&quot;=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot; &quot;Search 
Bar&quot;=&quot;http://www.google.com/ie&quot; 
[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerSearchURL] 
&quot;&quot;=&quot;http://www.google.com/keyword/%s&quot; 
&quot;provider&quot;=&quot;gogl&quot; 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftInternet ExplorerSearch] 
&quot;SearchAssistant&quot;=&quot;http://www.google.com/ie&quot;</pre> save as 
filename.reg and double click on it. Works for 2000, not sure about others. 
Will need to logout/in to take effect.</li> 
<li>Run dos command prompt from right-click context menu:<br>

<pre> [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\cmd] @=&quot;Open Command Window 
Here&quot; [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\cmd\command] @=&quot;cmd.exe /k 
\&quot;cd %L\&quot;&quot; [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shell\cmd] @=&quot;Open 
Command Window Here&quot; [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shell\cmd\command] 
@=&quot;cmd.exe /k \&quot;cd %L\&quot;&quot;</pre> (Tip from Frederik Juul 
Christiani)</li> </ul> 
<h3>Shell Replacements</h3> 
<p> If you find explorer.exe to be a UI disaster, or just plain inconvenient, 
you may want to try a replacement shell such as LiteStep,DarkStep, or some 
other. This can be a good way to obviate the brain-dead window manager/desktop 
environment that is provided with windows. A good place to start isShellfront, 
orDMOZ. Be forewarned that some shell replacements (just like some X11 WMs) are 
not very mature. Litestep is mature, and has an installer.</p> 
<p> In addition windowblindshttp://www.windowblinds.net/ (although not linux 
like at all) can do similar things with the windows shell to make it much more 
useful.</p> 
<h2>Programming</h2> 
<p> In which we discuss some of the first things a Linux programmer might run 
into when attempting to code on Windows, as well as cross-platform tools and 
techniques that will let you write code that basically works on more than one 
system, modulo the bit of tweaking that's always necessary.</p> 
<p>Most of the major scripting languages (Ruby, Tcl, Python, Perl, and so on) 
work pretty well on Windows, so using one of those is often a good idea.</p> 
<h3>GUI Toolkits</h3> 
<p> One area that has always been problematic is the GUI Toolkit. Make 
something very cross-platform, and users are still likely to make applications 
that don't look quite right anywhere. On the other hand, that's probably better 
than being tied to one platform with no possibility of porting.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>wxWidgets is a C++ toolkit that seems to be gaining in popularity.</li> 
<li> Tk is a cross platform toolkit that is closely associated with the Tcl 
programming language. It is, however, available to other languages. Many view 
it as having an antiquated look and feel, however, work is well underway to 
modernize it, thanks to theTile project. </li> 
<li>Qt is a C++ toolkit released by TrollTech, which has seen widespread 
success in the KDE environment. Licensing issues may come into play for 
commercial use, however.</li> 
<li>The GTK+ toolkit has also been ported to Windows.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Security</h3> 
<p> We've all heard the horror stories about Windows security. Here are some 
tips for improving it.</p> 
<p>First off, we start with a guide dedicated to windows security: Secure your 
Windows XP/2000 system. </p> 
<p> And continue with some other suggestions, contributed by the wiki's users: 
</p> 
<p> One annoying problem is the huge number of malware (dialers, trojan 
horses, bots ...) easily installed in virtue of os bugs. I found a little 
utilityAutoruns (freeware but not free software) very useful to discover 
register keys added by malware, making it easier to manually remove them.</p> 
<h3>Windows Registry</h3> 
<p> The following locations are favorites of malware and viruses - after 
adding themselves here, they are automatically run.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run</li> 
<li>HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/RunServices</li> 
<li>HKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/Browser Helper 
Objects</li> </ul> 
<p> The Browser Helper Objects are add-ons to Internet Explorer. Some are 
legitimate, like Flash, Spybot, Java, or Acrobat. Some are completely bogus 
malware. In that case, one finds funny hexademical folders in the registry 
'directory'. Each of these pertains to something called a GUID, a Globally 
Unique Identifier. In this case, the GUID refers to a DLL add-on, and DLLs 
contain class objects, so that's why we call this particular kind of GUID a 
CLASSID. To find out which CLASSID goes to what add-on in IE, you have to look 
in:<code>HKCR/CLSID</code> </p>

<h3>Explore2fs</h3> 
<p> Explore2fs is a file-manager that lets you browse ext2 and ext3 
filesystems from within Windows.</p>  Copyright &copy; 2000-2011 David N. Welton
