<h3> How to dual-boot Windows XP and Linux. (Now updated for Ubuntu 9.04.)</h3>
<strong>Page 1 - Intro</strong> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Updated 2 March 2009 - now uses Ubuntu 9.04 as the Linux 
distribution</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You want to install XP on your machine alongside 
your existing Linux installation on the same physical drive which already has 
Ubuntu 9.04 installed.</p> 
<p><strong>Tutorial Summary:</strong> We'll create space on the Linux 
partition to install Windows XP. XP bootloader is fairly clumsy when it comes 
to dualbooting and will overwrite GRUB completely. We'll reinstall GRUB to the 
MBR and configure it to dualboot both Ubuntu and XP.</p> 
<p>This tutorial has been tested on a Sun Virtualbox 2.1.2 virtual machine.

<br>SAY, if you (or anyone else) is having this error with XP, then you will 
need to find and download the SATA drivers for your disk. I had this prob and 
got them from gateway.com. press F6 during the initial setup of XP, when 
prompted to do so, to intstall 3rd party drivers.<br>

<h3>Koji:</h3> My steps were a little different, when I first installed Edgy I 
created a partition for Windows to reside in at a later date, so windows is 
hd(0,0)<br>
<br>
 After installing Windows XP MCE, the first time, the system 
drive was F:\. I then re-installed XP MCE from scratch to the same partition 
(deleting the original installation), and the system drive for windows is now 
C:.<br>
<br>
 Dual boot works great, hd(0,0) = Windows, hd(0,1) = edgy. <br>

<h3>Vimal George:</h3> What can I say? <br>
<br>
 You guys just wrote the 
Superlative article on the topic thats been bugging me.<br>
<br>
 I'm a 
stickler for performance. I don't care much for windows except for the 
occassionaly must-have win32 app without *nix equiavalents(the list approaches 
NiL as i speak!)<br>
<br>
 The thought of Win XP being at the high-performance 
end of my 100GB hard disk irks me no end. I'd rather my Ubuntu workstation 
install reside there.<br>
 Win XP is about to be banished to the last 6GB of my 
Disk(muhahaha take that! B1LL)<br>
<br>
 This approach also allows for more 
flexible partitioning strategies such as a Linux Swap partition mounted at 
/dev/hda2 right after the &quot;/&quot; partition for performance reasons(i.e 
READ Disk access times and seek latency Numbers)<br>
<br>
 Also keeping a 
common &quot;/home&quot; mounted partition is a good idea for organizing your 
personal data with redundancy.<br>
<br>
 Plus all I have to do to get access to 
my<br>
 &quot;/home&quot; partition under XP is to use the Fs-driver Ext2 
Kernel Filesystem extensions in XP)<br>
 www.fs-driver.org <br>
 anyway <br>
 
All in all.. a very whole-some article. Keep it coming. I'm now a fan :-)<br>

<br> Suggestions: <br>
 An edit could be added to include the taxonomy for x,y 
in the grub(x,y)commands mentioned in your tutorial. The numbering scheme there 
starts from hd0 ; unlike<br>
 /dev/hdaX, where hda1 is always first. <br>

<h3>Another user:</h3> This how to guide is very flawed. Like several other 
people, I don't seem to have the manae flags in my menu. Now my Ubuntu install 
is dead.<br>
<br>
 Note to the author: Put in some updates, or at the very 
least some alternate options to fix the boot record. I am not sure if your live 
CD is older, and still has the option, or if you are using a different version 
of GPARTED. Get your stuff updated please!<br>

 boot from the CD) 
and nothing happens! my PC is a Dell Dimension 5150 running XP.<br>

<h3>Toosmoky:</h3> &quot;There are ways to make the Ubuntu partition bootable 
while still using XP&rsquo;s bootloader in the MBR. However this is fiddly and 
involves using FAT32 partitions&quot;<br>
<br>
 Bzzzzt! A FAT32 partition is 
not necessary. I've set up many XP/Linux dual boot systems using the NT 
bootloader off an NTFS partition. I currently run a XP/Ubuntu Feisty system 
with no FAT partitions within cooee.<br>
<br>
 Although one can set it up 
manually, the easiest way is to use bootpart. Either LILO or GRUB can be used 
and both work without any drama at all.<br>
<br>
 One advantage is that if you 
select the linux partition at bootup then decide you want Windows instead, you 
just choose windows when you get to the linux bootloader, thus reloading the NT 
bootloader again.<br>

<h3>CalvinK (New user):</h3> I had Error 13 as well then i figured out the 
problem: you have to name the right partition the XP is on. My problem was I 
forgot about the &quot;swap&quot; partition which was recommended when I 
installed Ubuntu... therefore it makes XP on the 3rd partition, or hd(0,2) 
instead of hd(0,1)<br>
hd(0,1) = 1st hard drive, 2nd partition <br>
hd(0,2) = 
1st hard drive, 3rd partition (&quot;1st&quot; starts at 0)<br>
hopes this helps

<h3>Ron Lankshear:</h3> Thank You - your steps are very good and I was able to

<br>
 XP now is default boot. <br>

The other way round XP adding Linux failed. All was well but Ubuntu boot failed
<br> <br>
 run_progess `/sbin/modprobe` abnormal exit <br>
<br>
 
https://launchpad.net/bugs/84964<br>
 does not seem to be a fix. <br>
<br>
 
Left me with an unbootable machine - so I reformatted drive and installed 
Ubuntu 704.<br>
 and followed your steps above to have Dual boot working great. 
<br> I'd suggest a warning on your XP to Linux. <br>
<br>
 I got to do this as 
my OLD HD failed and after I put a new one - neither XP or my Macbook could 
read the bad drive.<br>
<br>
 Ubuntu 704 LiveCD could and was able to recover 
99% without resort to backups which were not that current.<br>
<br>
 So I am a 
happy with Ubuntu and some things it can do BUT there is a lot I still need XP 
for - Scanners printers etc<br>
