<h3> Windows XP More Secure than Linux </h3> 
<p><br>
Anyone who tracks security vulnerability reports knows of the 
ridiculous amount that reference holes in Linux. For whatever reason this is 
never talked about and Linux gets this magic aura of invulnerability. Part of 
the confusion lies with the complexity of the open source Linux model that 
separates Linux &quot;Distributions&quot; from Linux &quot;Kernel&quot; 
vulnerabilities. Now if you start looking into and adding up Linux 
&quot;Distribution&quot; vulnerabilities that can take you into thehundreds upon
hundreds of security holes that are never talked about. To simplify things I 
took the latestLinux Kernel v2.6.x and compared it to Windows XP. This is more 
than a fair comparison for the shocking results to follow.<br>
<br>
As with 
Firefox, Linux vulnerabilities are frequently lumped together in single 
advisories misleading the true vulnerability count:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Windows 
XP -170 Advisories = 213 Vulnerabilities.<br>
Linux Kernel v2.6.x - 108 
Advisories =<strong> 231 Vulnerabilities</strong>.<br>
<br>
Even with open 
source advocates finally admitting thatLinux is insecure they still try to 
claim it is more secure than Windows. Too bad this is now proven to be another 
myth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Windows XP is more secure than Linux and sexier ;)<br>

<p> And they also said it would be cheaper :) -&gt; Yet another marketing 
play. Yes, you can download the OS and Software but the ones that you have to 
use professionally cost big time and lets centralize all at one place (It takes 
me back to the 70s, 80s).<br>
UI is okeay if all used it and not used console 
for all.</p> </dd>

<p> Let's review. &quot;Linux&quot; is nothing more than a kernel. 
&quot;Windows XP&quot; is an operating system. &quot;Red Hat&quot;, 
&quot;Debian&quot;, &quot;SuSE&quot; are organizations/companies that have 
created their own operating system powered by the Linux kernel. So, &quot;Red 
Hat AS4&quot;, or &quot;SuSE Linux Enterprise Server&quot; are &quot;operating 
systems&quot;. Now, having cleared that up, you are making a comparison first, 
with a kernel, and then second, with a slew of operating systems. Your 
statement of &quot;Windows XP&quot; is more secure than Linux isn't a relevant 
comparison because first you would either be comparing it to a kernel, and then 
next alot of operating systems. To be fair, the way you would calculate your 
exploits would be to first identify all the exploits of the kernel, then add 
any additional exploit that does not include the previously listed kernel 
exploits to &quot;an&quot; operating system. Note, that is one. If you want to 
compare them individually, that would be fine, but otherwise, it would be like 
comparing &quot;Debian Hardened Operating System version Potato&quot; to 
&quot;Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows NT, etc&quot; and summing all of 
Windows known exploits at a time. So this comparison isn't really any better 
than the other previously listed comparisons, which is disappointing seeing as 
the author did attempt to discredit those additional mislabeled comparisons.<br>
 Finally, if you wanted to be truely fair about these comparisons, you have to 
weigh the severity of each noted type of exploit in some fashion and assign it 
a score based on severity, ease, maybe even risk, and then sum up the scores of 
these to make a serious risk. That would seem to be a bit more useful in 
determining how &quot;insecure&quot;/&quot;secure&quot; something is, but then 
again, there are those of us who realize &quot;nothing truely is secure&quot;, 
all it really boils down to is minimizing risk.<br>
Following up, noting the 
comment from paletteguy, Linux &quot;can&quot; be cheaper, but not if you are 
interested and set on paying one of the well known companies for support for 
one of the pricey versions of a Linux powered operating system. I don't exactly 
buy into this model of buying support, especially based on my experience with 
Novell for example, when the consultants were constantly badgering me for my 
documentation to prove my points against their suggestions, which in 
retrospect, are they not the ones who are supposed to be providing us with said 
information? So if I were managing a company, I would much rather hire people 
who know the OS really well and pay &quot;them&quot; to be my support. First of 
all, you would have a much better support team as they would really know the 
product, being the Linux powered operating system of choice, and secondly if 
you doled out the support costs of one of these enterprise class operating 
systems to your staff who are to support the OS, you would have much more 
longevity out of your employees, and there would be much less turnover.<br>
I 
would also like to add that the ones you pay for do not add the 
&quot;professional&quot; into the mix, but it's the user...the admin. And you 
can certainly use GUI's (well defined ones I might add) for desktop or server 
use. I'm not sure what the comment about the 70's and 80's refers to, but it 
seems this person is confusing &quot;mainframe&quot; terminology with today's 
trends (oh but wait....what is all this virtualization bit all about...could 
that not be consolidation? amazing how tech trends go back and forth ;), and 
moreover when dealing with &quot;high availability&quot;, clustering proved to 
be an effective approach at this. So i'm not sure if this person is thinking 
that this is an attempt at centralization or not, but each 
(centralization/distributed) models have benefits and risks. One might want to 
read up on both to realize this.<br>

<p> Let's get some things straight. First I'm going to say that I sit on the 
fence between open source &amp; : software is software and I don't mix politics 
and software for that matter. However there is noticable bias in the writing of 
many articles on this site. Second I have no credentials in security so this is 
coming from a security novice.<br>
<br>
According to Secunia, Linux Kernal 
2.6.X has 18 unpatched advisories, Windows XP Professional has 32, Home edition 
has 29. Granted that I have not taken the time to count individual 
vulnerabilities so all these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. Your 
view of which OS/Kernel is most secure is coming from historical advisory 
numbers and isn't taking account of the time it takes to develop,test and 
publish a patch.<br>
<br>
Some Windows XP vulnerabilities are also grouped such 
as advisoriesSA21417 and SA22341.<br>
<br>
Finally take a look at the most 
severe unpatched Secunia advisory rating. It's currently higher for XP. 
Security isn't a matter of what did affect us in the past, it's what is 
affecting us now.</p> </dd>

<p> Actually no I am comparing the Linux Kernel to Windows XP. Since the 
technicalities of what Linux stands for can be manipulated at will by the open 
source zealots to try and confuse the average person. When arguments were made 
involving what you call Linux &quot;Operating Systems&quot; and Windows XP, the 
zealots cried that you should only compare the Kernel. Either way it is 
irrelevant since all of those Linux &quot;Operating Systems&quot; include these 
vulnerabilities. Thus including the distribution vulnerabilities would be much 
worse for Linux.<br>
<br>
These are NOT exploites but vulnerabilities. What is 
listed is the total amount of vulnerabilities, which is a very simple 
comparison.<br>
<br>
The time to develop, test and publish a patch is 
irrelevant since this data can easily be manipulated and the testing of a Linux 
Patch does not effect anywhere near the amount or scope of Windows users and 
software.<br>
<br>
Funny you should bring up the Windows &quot;grouping&quot; 
which were counted, and you show 2-3 vulnerabilities. Unlike the Linux one that 
lists 18, or the Firefox one which lists 27! This is common with Open Source 
software and is very misleading.<br>
<br>
The Secunia total Advisory rating is 
useless since the grouping makes any analysis from the advisories irrelevant.

<p> As was said already, you should see the severity of these vulnerabilities.
<br><br>
since we are playing with number published by Secunia,<br>
<br>

compare Windows XP<br>
http://secunia.com/product/22/?task=statistics_2006<br>

<br>with Linux kernel 2.6.x<br>

http://secunia.com/product/2719/?task=statistics_2006<br>
<br>
for 2006<br>
<br>
-criticality<br>
Linux kernel 2.6.x: extremely=0%, highly=0%<br>
WinXP: 
extremely=7%, highly=27%<br>
<br>
-where from<br>
Linux kernel 2.6.x: remote=27%
<br>WinXP: remote=53%<br>
<br>
-impact:<br>
Linux kernel 2.6.x: system access=0%
<br>WinXP: system access=54%!<br>
<br>
in other words they are fewer (18 as 
opposed to 32) and less critical for linux<br>
<br>
as for the rest of a 
GNU-Linux OS, apart from some parts of Xorg, as far as I know everything else 
runs in userspace, thus can't do any significant damage.<br>
<br>
Also remember 
when we are talking about the Linux kernel, this includes any drivers 
(open-source that is) the system uses. To my opinion, the insecurity found in 
windows is partly the driver vendors fault (and of course some design 
philosophies)</p> </dd>

<p> Well in reading the comments posted, there are people here that are much 
more qualified than I. However, the article, while pointing out the security 
issues with an OS versus just the Kernel is not accurate.<br>
<br>
Here are the 
problems with this article, coming from me, and what I have observed on both 
operating systems.<br>
<br>
First, for a simple home computer, Windows cost an 
arm, but now will cost an arm and a leg, where as Linux, can be downloaded for 
free, or a much smaller fee (compared to windows) can be paid.<br>
<br>

Secondly, you get what you pay for typically in other products (with 
exceptions) and well for the price we pay for Windows, it should be much 
better, work smoothly, however, it often has more errors than one knows what to 
do with, and we can not forget those times that files are randomly changed to 
read only, or moved even by Windows.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, Windows allows any 
program really to change the registry and has no security features to prevent 
that like Linux does. In Linux the root password (on setting it that way) has 
to be provided, preventing random programs to generate things.<br>
<br>
Looking 
at that, really puts it in perspective. And to throw out another twist, any 
Linux user and recompile their own Kernel, therefore we could have thousands of 
different versions out there.<br>
<br>
I am just impressed that Linux has 
withstood all these attacks. And while I would love to see the day when more 
people buy Linux on a PC than Windows, it does not seem doable as the games and 
everything are not written for Linux, Windows and Mac... Until then, I will be 
using both, using Windows for complete compatability, while Linux will be my 
play system.</p> </dd>

<p> STOP listing the secunia &quot;advisory&quot; totals which is not an 
accurate listing of the vulnerabilties.<br>
<br>
This is NOT comparing 2006 but 
ALL TIME! What is stated is very clear.<br>
<br>
How much something costs is 
irrelevant to how secure it is.<br>
<br>
On a limited user account Windows XP 
does NOT let &quot;anything&quot; change the registry. This is identical to 
Linux. Have Linux users even used Windows before?<br>
<br>
I have never seen 
more excuses in my life. Linux is a convoluted mess that all starts with the 
Linux Kernel yet people try to make some illogical argument that the comparison 
is not accurate? Please all the popular distributions include the latest kernel 
(v2.6.x) thus include these vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
This ONE version of the 
Linux Kernel (v2.6.x) has more vulnerabilities than Windows XP which has been 
out for 5 years. That is very telling of the insecure state of Linux which is 
overly hyped as &quot;secure&quot;.</p> </dd>

<br>And that, of course, has NOTHING to do with the fact that XP hasn't been 
developed any further in 5 years, while the Linux kernel has been in<b>constant
</b> development (and still is!) during that entire time.<br>
<br>
Give it up, 
this is nonsense. WinXP is an OS, and Linux is a kernel. WinXP is 
&quot;finished&quot; and Linux is always under development. WinXP has to be 
restarted when you install the teeniest-tinyest piece of software, while Linux 
can run for years and still have up-to-date software.<br>
<br>
So yeah, focus 
your beady little eyes on secunia-statistics. That won't change the fact that 
Linux and all the GNU/Linux distributions are miles ahead of Windows XP. I 
mean, you even said it yourself... Windows XP is frikkin' 5 years old!!!</p>

<p> to Andrew:<br>
<br>
the article makes use of these statistics to make its 
claim, but does a bad job.<br>
<br>
the statistics given for 2006 are not ALL 
TIME! There is a separate section for ALL TIME (which covers 2003-2006) and 
separate sections for each year. Just click the 2006 one. There are 45 Secunia 
advisories released for WinXP for 2006 and there are 44 for Linux 2.6.x for the 
same year.<br>
<br>
if you don't trust these values then don't use them at all. 
But if you do, at least use them right!<br>
<br>
and once again, yes Linux is 
just the kernel (PLUS DRIVERS! remember that), but the rest of the GNU-Linux OS 
(no matter what disttro you use), has little to offer in terms of serious 
vulnerabilities, since most things run in user-space.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unless if 
you are working for Microsoft, I can't see a reason for you to make this claim.

<br>Um did you miss Service Pack 2 for XP in 2004? Maybe you have missed all

<p> Andrew, I love your definition of &quot;secure&quot;. Please, remind me 
never to employ you.<br>
<br>
Sure - you point out that Linux kernel 2.6.x has 
more vulnerabilities then WinXP. But you either refuse to accept or don't want 
to accept that the WinXP vulnerabilities are both more serious<b>and</b> 
remotely accessible. Quoting from the same source as your figures:<br>
<br>

Criticallity:<br>
for Win XP<br>
Extremely: 4%<br>
Highly: 30%<br>
Moderately: 
31%<br>
Less: 27%<br>
Not: 8%<br>
<br>
for Linux 2.6.x<br>
Extremely: 0%<br>

Highly: 0%<br>
Moderately: 15%<br>
Less: 55%<br>
Not: 31%<br>
<br>
And don't 
look at the location of exploit figures, or you'll never ever trust a Windows 
machine on a network ever again. A small detail of 57% of all vulnerabilities 
for Windows XP being<b>remotely accessible</b> (the figure for Linux 2.6.x is 
19%, which isn't good but still better).<br>
<br>
Of course (as Secunia say), 
these figures are not a valid basis for comparing OSs. I prefer a simple 
practical test: Which OS works better for me? In my case, I changed to Linux 
(from Windows) many years ago, because Linux (and its associated applications 
software) was far more stable and reliable. I use WinXP at work, and I can tell 
you that I have not seen anything to convince me that situation has changed at 
all.<br>
<br>
Facts, you say? I can give you facts, but you won't like them so 
there is no point. You'll just distort them or someone elses figures to try and 
reinforce your (lost) point.<br>
Get over your insecurities and move on with 
your life.</p> </dd>

<p> I am already employed in IT and deal with security daily, I do not 
irrationally take online gossip as a decision to use certain software but I 
evaluate the FACTS!<br>
<br>
First of all your percentages are the ADVISORIES! 
Those are not taking into account the vulnerabilities. Something that has one 
severe advisory that includes one vulnerability is much more secure than one 
advisory that includes<b>18</b> vulnerabilities!<br>
<br>
Anyone who claims XP 
is unstable has no business using computers ever again.</p> </dd>

<dd> 
<p> Hmmm. Seems <i>you</i> fail basic logic. 0% extreme or high criticality 
ADVISORIES means 0 extreme or high criticality VULNERABILITIES.<br>
With, what 
was it, 140 WinXP advisories? - that means at least 5 extreme and 42 high 
criticallity vulnerabilities (4% and 30% of 140 respectively).<br>
And still 
57% of the remotely accessible!<br>
<br>
As I said, you aren't interested in 
any facts that upset your world view. That is obvious.<br>
<br>
And for the 
record - I did not say XP was unstable - I said that Linux is more stable and 
reliable. XP is a vast improvement over previous Windows versions but it is 
still less stable and reliable than Linux.<br>
<br>
And since I strongly

<p> The facts are clearly stated. Linux is less secure than Windows XP. 
Security &quot;ratings&quot; are widely debateable on how insecure they make 
you. Something does not have to gain system access to severly affect your 
security.<br>
<br>
I strongly suggest you get a clue, since I have been in IT 
for over 15 years. How much you do not know has been proven with your 
unintelligent comments.<br>
<br>
Linux is not more stable and reliable than XP. 
That just shows even clearly how little you know. I do not have any stability

<p> All I'm going to say Andrew is that your failing to understand the meaning 
of analysis. You are supposed to weigh up the facts with evidence in a balanced 
manner and then form a conclusion based on your findings. What your doing is 
presenting a one sided argument.<br>
<br>
<i>The time to develop, test and

testing of a Linux Patch does not effect anywhere near the amount or scope of 
Windows users and software.</i><br>
<br>
Is it really? I find it incredible to 
read that your employed in IT and you find the patch turnaround time to be 
irrelevant. The longer vulnerabilities are out in the wild the more potential 
damage is being done. That is widely acknowleged and I'll refer you to 
incidents such asthis.<br>
<br>
<i>Funny you should bring up the Windows

common with Open Source software and is very misleading.</i><br>
<br>
That's 
the only real valid point you have in the whole of your article.<br>
<br>
<i>
The Secunia total Advisory rating is useless since the grouping makes any 
analysis from the advisories irrelevant.</i><br>
<br>
The rating is based on 
the most severe vulnerability discovered. Even as they are grouped it doesn't 
make it useless.</p> </dd>

The evidence is balanced and the facts are weighed up. Linux has had more

<br>
Damage to what? Most of the unpatched 
vulnerabilities in Windows are blocked with DEP protection enabled anyway, the 
rest via a firewall and none do anything in a limited user environment which is 
what IT runs their user base in. What is widely acknowleged is their is alot of 
online hype that does not relate to the actual security environment in the real 
world. Security companies make their money by selling these scary stories. IT 
environments in the real world do not have these problems regardless of patch 
time.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>The rating is based on the most severe vulnerability 
discovered. Even as they are grouped it doesn't make it useless.</i>&quot;<br>

<br>Well useless from the perspective of actual damage to the user, since 
different breaches of security effect different people in different ways.</p>

&quot;<i>Why

Linux without the need for NX support since 2000?</i>&quot;<br>

You don't 
DEP is provided through software in Windows too. Though NX support makes it 
even more secure. I think Linux users need to use Windows once in a while.<br>

<br>&quot;<i>And why should anyone trust that woeful excuse for a firewall that

Have you ever heard of the &quot;Designed for Windows XP&quot;

It still provides protection. Without 
hardware backing you at best get emulation which is never a guarantee. 
Regardless software DEP is present on Windows XP SP2 and Vista adds ASLR.<br>

<br>
What you are 
saying makes no sense. There is nothing to fool. The fact remains that when 
testing real world applications there is no distinguishable difference between 
the protection offered by PaX without NX, and DEP with NX.<br>
<br>
And DEP's 
protection with NX is still questionable.<br>
<br>
Not including ASLR from the 
beginning was a mistake. Without it DEP is vulnerable to an exploit technique 
known as return-to-libc.<br>
<br>
I suppose your solution is to buy a new 
computer and Vista when a Pentium III with Linux or OpenBSD could have the same 
level of protection?<br>
<br>
And SSP and technology that works through the 
compiler cannot be enforced with the majority of the software for Vista that 
comes in binary only.<br>
<br>
And the technology uses an underutilized 
component of the processor, the supervisor bit. Not emulation as you claim.<br>

<br><i>The constant distro mess and lack of game and driver support.</i><br>

<br>Obviously there is a trend here!<br>
<br>
<i>The number of vulnerabilities 
directly relates to the security of the software out of the users control.</i>
<br><br>
No. Mac OS 9 and OS/2 are great examples of operating systems that 
have close to no vulnerabilities yet provide pathetic security.<br>
<br>
If you 
are serious about security then you understand the nature of the advisories and 
work around them. A user's security is NEVER out of their control.<br>
<br>

I found your statement &quot;Windows XP More

statement.<br>
<br>
The great thing about Linux is that it can complement or 
replace your existing UNIX installations without the upheaval that switching to 
Windows would entail. UNIX and Linux are not far apart, so it is easier to 
refer to them as one entity.<br>
<br>
<i>Most likely? You don't even know yet

<br>
<i>Must

<br>Where did you get that number? You are ignoring the true impact of Linux. 
Servers, workstations and embedded applications are the leading adopters of 
Linux.<br>
<br>
In none of these areas is gaming even a concern.<br>
<br>
You 
seem obsessed with being able to play games. If Linux &quot;sucks&quot; because 
you can not play your favorite games, you should change the article title.<br>

<br>Something like &quot;Linux doesn't let me play my games and I will 
therefore find other evidence that it is bad&quot; would have been more fitting.
<br><br>
If you have a genuine problem with Linux (or its security) other then 
that it cannot play *Windows* games, then tell everyone.<br>
<br>
Maybe some 
Linux zealot told you how Linux is the best operating system out there for 
anyone. I really don't know what happened, but you clearly wasted your time if 
using Windows games was your primary concern.<br>
<br>
And I really have a hard 
time understanding why you cannot just pick a distribution and stick with it. 
People that embrace a distro of the week attitude are just as confusing to me.

means it is running in software and thus pretending to be something AKA

no DEP and DEP with NX is better than regular DEP.<br>
<br>
Yes ASLR is better 
which is why Vista comes with it. That doesn't excuse the vulnerabilities in 
Linux.<br>

Since a PIII is unable to play the latest games let alone the

done wants to compile something, they simply want to use it.<br>

No PaX 
without hardware NX is emulated NX and you incur some performance hit. Using 
the supervisor bit is just a trick and not a substitute for real NX hardware 
support.<br>
<br>
Mac OS9 and OS/2 have no user base anymore. Linux is still 
currently used even with only 0.37% market share, it is actively developed. But 
I can't imagine how many vulnerabilities would exist in Linux if it had

Anything can bypass ANY firewall once it has compromised your system logged in 
as an administrator! Outbound filtering does not guarantee anything unless you

It 
is emulation in the sense that no NX bit is present. It isn't software though. 
I still credit the PaX authors for their deep understanding of the features of

DEP (or PaX) 
only shine when you are running a server or a multiuser machine.<br>
<br>
I 
don't think that Windows is inherently insecure.<br>

For a small scale

of protection.<br>
<br>
<i>Man what is with you guys and non compiled software?

<br>
I don't compile my own software, unless there is a 
special situation that truly requires it. If you pick a good distribution like 
RHEL, or its free relative Fedora Core, the software is compiled with these 
protections built in.<br>
<br>
Imagine Apache releases a new version. Red Hat 
will compile it for their customers with this technology already implemented. 
Very few Linux users actually get their software directly from the site of 
origin.<br>
<br>
They wait for it to be &quot;digested&quot; by their 
distribution of choice.<br>

Windows XP came with a firewall from day 1. In

they updated and enabled the XP Firewall in SP2 by default. They kept it basic 
because outbound protection is useless running as an admin! It is of no

&quot;<i>It is emulation in the sense that no NX bit is present. It isn't

Partially and it is not full NX. Regardless

<br>
&quot;<i>I do think 
Microsoft owes its customers using XP the ability to fix some of the problems

<br>I don't see any problems with it and it works fine. How much the lack of 
ASLR puts you at risk is debateable. Regardless it is in Vista.<br>
<br>
&quot;
<i>DEP (or PaX) only shine when you are running a server or a multiuser machine.
</i>&quot;<br>
<br>
Not at all, stopping buffer overflow attacks prevents many 
exploits that malware uses to install. This is why a system running DEP is much 
less vulnerable to any exploit that uses an unknown unpatched vulnerability 
like this.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>They are out of control in terms of appearing. All 
I was claiming was that even an unpatched Windows 95 user or RHL 1.1 user still

I 
disagree. Windows 95 has not received security patches since 2001. Once patches 
stop you cannot guarantee security.<br>

&quot;<i>I am quite certain that 
leaktest could run under a limited user account. Outbound filtering would be 
useful if you had a NAT configuration, and wanted to block certain activities

<br>
While it can run, this is irrelevant since 
the average user runs Windows as full admin. Managed systems use limited 
accounts and setup outboundfiltering on hardware firewalls or servers.<br>
<br>

&quot;<i>When your router, cell phone, web site, Tivo, and GPS handheld run

<p> &quot;<i>Your definition of a firewall is quite different than mine. A 
firewall should be able to manipulate any activity that pertains to the TCP/IP 
stack. The Windows firewall might be good enough for you, but it certainly 
lacks the functionality most would expect.</i>&quot;<br>
<br>
That is not 
defining it but giving an opinion on the feature set. A firewall's main purpose 
is to provide security from attacks and the Windows XP SP2 firewall is an 
excellent solution that does just that. It is designed for home desktop users, 
which is an area Linux still does not understand. It provides security easily 
and unobtrusively.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>The other excuse, that a process could 
masquerade as another has been thoroughly dealt with by the likes of executable 
hashing that even rudimentary free firewalls like ZoneAlarm offer.</i>&quot;<br>
<br>Once something has system access as admin it impossible to guarantee this. 
Without complex hijacking of a process in memory malware can simply try to 
connect as IE.exe. Most users would just let it through. There are many ways to 
defeat outbound filtering and with full system access it is impossible to stop 
on XP. Vista has put in system safe guards that make this extremely difficult 
to do even with full system access. Which is why outbound filtering is 
irrelevant on XP.<br>
<br>
I already stated ASLR is in Vista and maybe they 
stole it from OpenBSD? I simply don't care.</p> </dd>

I realize that, when I 
use XP x64 I don't get much of a choice. Third party vendors still have to 
catch up and make compatible products.<br>
<br>
I stand by my original opinion 
that home users could benefit from outbound filtering.<br>
<br>
Even ignoring 
the malicious, a user might want some notification that an application is 
calling home.<br>

At least it would raise the bar significantly. Malware authors would have to 
corrupt the running firewall (ZoneAlarm, for instance) to get it to apply the 
same rules as it would for IE. I have had it set off alarms due to small 
updates to IE that change its executable hash somewhat.<br>
<br>
Another use 
would be simple port blocking (or something more sophisticated) if you didn't 
want people behind a gateway engaging in some activity. Like wasting time at 
work on IM or online games.<br>
<br>
Skype had proven to be a notoriously hard 
thing to block. With sophisticated stateful firewalls like iptables or pf, you 
can analyze relationships that normally would be ignored to its usage of 
inconspicuous ports and other obfuscation techniques.<br>
<br>
IPSec sounds 
good at first, but in reality is too static for typical usage for anything 
other than a server.<br>
<br>
ASLR was invented by PaX. I just found it ironic 
that Microsoft accuses Linux of violating its IP, makes no concrete claims, yet 
gives no credit to ASLR's original author.<br>
<br>
In addition, the ASLR 
implementation in Vista has some weaknesses.<br>
<br>
It still doesn't 
randomize the stack or heap.<br>
<br>
And for legacy support, exes distributed 
without flags set for protection won't benefit from ASLR by default.<br>
<br>

insecure but I consider it no more secure than Windows and this is just another

<br>
I agree with your point. I wouldn't tell someone that 
Windows is more secure, or that Linux is. That has been my entire point.<br>

<br><i>This can be said of any OS that is run in these devices including 
Windows CE.</i><br>
<br>
How many routers have you seen with CE? There is a set 
engineering cost for a vendor to adopt either Linux or CE to their devices. 
Beyond that, the costs per device is what matters. Even with a cost of 5 
dollars per device, the ultimate amount adds up.<br>
<br>
<i>I disagree. 
Windows 95 has not received security patches since 2001. Once patches stop you 
cannot guarantee security.</i><br>
<br>
If I were to put this Windows 95 user 
behind a hardware firewall, gave them a modern web browser, and educated them 
on secure practices I can see no security issues.</p> </dd>

<p> I am not qualified to comment on this quarrel about the security of 
Windows versus Linux, but this market share discussion is puzzling.<br>

I 
did a simple web-search for &quot;Linux&quot; and &quot;Windows XP&quot;. The 
Windows search returned 103 million hits, the Linux search returned 201 million

<br>
No it is not scientific, but at least acknowledge that Linux is 
BIG, and here to stay.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to know how many Linux desktop 
users there are, but it has been estimated that the number is around 29 million 
and growing fast.<br>

I am typing this on my laptop happily running Ubuntu 
Linux, and how much time do I use searching for Viruses and remowing adware, 
updating my virusprogram and so on ?<br>

<p> &quot;<i>I stand by my original opinion that home users could benefit from 
outbound filtering.</i>&quot;<br>
<br>
Outbound filtering causes some of the 
most problems for home users. Talk to anyone who works at a Microsoft helpdesk 
and they will tell you one of their #1 problems with people loosing internet 
access is the third party firewall blocking it. From a security standpoint it 
does nothing to prevent you from getting infected since you already have to be 
infected for it to try and connect out. The article I linked to proves 
conclusively why it is impossible to guarantee outboung filtering with someone 
running as an administrator in Windows XP. The problem is so called Windows 
&quot;experts&quot; irresponsibly recommend third party firewalls to people who 
do not need it. Instead of giving them accurate security advice. They scare 
them with ridiculous FUD.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>Even ignoring the malicious, a user 
might want some notification that an application is calling home.</i>&quot;<br>

<br>The average user does not care. I work with end users daily and they simply 
say yes and let everything connect. They do whatever is easier. I found 
massively infected machines with third party firewalls and all the malicious 
ports and applications were allowed access. These are the application not 
designed to circumvent a third party firewall. As for regular applications? 
They still don't care. Those that do already use a third party firewall. But 
telling the average user they need one is irresponsible.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>At

<br>
No 
it wouldn't if it connected as IE.exe! Most people wouldn't check and when you 
look in the program control section you would find two separate programs, one 
would be the real internet explorer the other would be IE.exe using the same 
exact icon but be a malicious program! Once you have system access there are 
many ways to bypass a third party firewall and with the freely available 
rootkits, it can easily go undetected. Do you realize what you are trying to 
do? You are attempting to stop something from connecting to the Internet AFTER 
it has already infected your machine! That is idiotic and impossible on Windows 
XP running as an admin.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>Another use would be simple port 
blocking (or something more sophisticated) if you didn't want people behind a 
gateway engaging in some activity. Like wasting time at work on IM or online

<br>
Port blocking is irrelevant if you are trying to 
block outbound activity on a Windows XP machine running as an admin with a 
software firewall. Anything can be blocked if you are running the firewall on 
separate secure server or from a good hardware firewall.<br>
<br>
The only 
people that would want to block Skype are businesses or educational 
institutions. That would be done from a central location and has nothing to do 
with the XP firewall!<br>
<br>
Home users don't use IPSec, it is mainly used 
with VPNs and SSL communications.<br>
<br>
Honestly I really don't care about 
who, what and where about ASLR. I am just happy it is in Vista. The rest 
doesn't address security.<br>
<br>
You can get enhanced ASLR for free:<br>
<br>

ASLR is the least of my concerns however.<br>

I haven't

Is that a joke? Try 
&quot;Windows&quot; which returns 665 million hits. But how many websites have

<br>
Yes, if a user is running as an administrator, anything they run could 
theoretically disable the firewall, antivirus or other software.<br>
<br>
I too 
have seen users get nervous when popups regarding system processes that look 
foreign are asking permission to act as servers or clients to alien IP 
addresses. Blocking the wrong service can lead to the internet appearing as if 
it's unreachable.<br>
<br>
Working in the role of an administrator tends to 
taint my view of what a firewall should do.<br>
<br>
I will admit, the Windows 
firewall does a good job of stealthing inbound ports. I am glad Microsoft 
pushed it more heavily to customers in SP2.<br>
<br>
<i>The average user does

<br>
When you take the 
average user's computer skills into question, the argument for third party 
firewalls does need a fair amount of skepticism.<br>
<br>
<i>No it wouldn't if

<br>

That was the role I had in mind. If someone doesn't want to cough up the cash 
for ISA/Commercial Firewall/Hardware Firewall, pf or iptables does become 
useful.<br>
<br>
<i>I haven't seen much of anything with a Linux OS in it. I 
have heard tons of hype about it in tech news though.</i><br>
<br>
Motorola's 
successor to the razr is supposed to use Linux. The TomTom gps device uses it. 
The Tivo uses it. A lot of routers, and cable/dsl modems have it. The OLPC has 
it (I think it is a joke, though.) Nokia has a new internet tablet.<br>
<br>

The main competition seems to come from VxWorks on networking devices and 
Symbian/Windows Mobile on smart phones/pdas. I used to have a handheld laptop 
like device from LG that ran CE, but I have not seen it since.<br>
<br>
<i>I 
wouldn't use or put anyone on Windows 95 ever. Absolutely no security is just 
one of many problems with 95. I actually don't use or recommend anything but 
Windows 2000 or XP for many reasons.</i><br>
<br>
As far as stability or 
support for modern software, Windows 2000 or XP are definitely better choices. 
NT is way beyond DOS in terms of sound architecture.<br>
<br>
My question still 
stands, if you knew that someone needed Windows 95, and only accessed the 
outside world through a web browser, what security issues would be presented by 
loading a recent copy of Opera or Firefox and putting them behind a decent 
firewall?<br>
<br>
I know that a billion vulnerabilities are probably waiting 
to be exploited, but if the user was knowledgeable, and had no one malicious on 
the local network or using the machine locally what security issues are there?
<br><br>
Windows and Linux have many vulnerabilities to be discovered, and 
there is a good possibility at least one hasn't been publicly disclosed. Even 
beyond that, the many that haven't been addressed at all will pose an issue to 
your system's security.<br>
<br>
<i>Once patches stop you cannot guarantee 
security.</i><br>
<br>
Security is never a guarantee. All that someone can 
promise is to issue patches to known vulnerabilities within a reasonable period.

<p> &quot;<i>Yes, if a user is running as an administrator, anything they run

<br><br>
The difference with AntiVirus is it is designed to catch the infection 
BEFORE it can do anything. If it catches it then there is nothing to do. 
Outboung filtering on a firewall is trying to stop something that has already 
infected you.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>That was the role I had in mind. If someone 
doesn't want to cough up the cash for ISA/Commercial Firewall/Hardware 
Firewall, pf or iptables does become useful.</i>&quot;<br>
<br>
I understand 
and see how it can be useful in a server environment but I was never discussing 
that. The Windows XP Firewall is strictly an end user based firewall since XP 
is a end user OS.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>My question still stands, if you knew that 
someone needed Windows 95, and only accessed the outside world through a web 
browser, what security issues would be presented by loading a recent copy of 
Opera or Firefox and putting them behind a decent firewall?</i>&quot;<br>
<br>

I wouldn't run it and wouldn't put my reputation behind it. Can you even find a 
firewall that still supports 95? Like I said you will not find me using 
anything but Windows 2000 or XP.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>Security is never a 
guarantee. All that someone can promise is to issue patches to known 
vulnerabilities within a reasonable period.</i>&quot;<br>
<br>
It is definitely 
NOT guaranteed when you know known vulnerabilities will NEVER be patched.</p>
