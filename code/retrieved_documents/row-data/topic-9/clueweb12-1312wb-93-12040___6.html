<h1>Run Linux Applications in Windows</h1> 
<h3>From Wired How-To Wiki</h3>  Jump to: navigation, search <br>

Two new 
best friends 
<p>Linux fans who feel the need to run a Windows app or two can take advantage 
ofWINE, which enables most programs written for Windows to run on the Linux 
desktop. But what about those seeking the opposite -- Windows fans that need to 
run Linux apps?</p> 
<p>If you're lucky, someone has already ported your favorite Linux app over to 
Windows. If not, here are some options for getting Linux apps on your Vista or 
XP desktop. It sounds daunting, but don't be scared -- all of these methods 
utilize the incredibly popular and easy to graspUbuntu Linux distribution. </p>

<h2> What's the need for Linux apps on Windows?</h2> 
<p>As for why you'd want to do this, there are several Linux apps that are 
much better -- and with more advanced features -- than their Windows 
counterparts.</p> <br>
Amarok on the desktop (Click for larger). 
<p>For example, Amarok is a superior alternative to Windows Media Player or 
iTunes, especially if you ever need to take music off your iPod. Amarok lets 
you move files in both directions -- onto the iPod and from the iPod onto your 
desktop, a function that iTunes by itself does not provide. Amarok also has 
better options for tagging your music than iTunes, and it features integration 
with Wikipedia and the Last.fm social network.</p> 
<p>Web developers and designers could test their pages against Linux browsers 
like Konqueror, Epiphany or even Midori! Also, those working in scientific 
fields probably use a number of Linux-based apps that haven't yet been ported 
to Windows (and may never be).</p> 
<p>Running apps in a faux-native environment will always be easier than 
dual-booting into a second OS. And aside from the practical concerns, it's just 
plain cool. Or creepy, depending on your thoughts.</p> 
<h2> andLinux</h2> 
<p>Check out andLinux, a complete Ubuntu Linux distribution built to run on 
all modern, 32-bit Windows operating systems like XP and Vista.</p> 
<p>AndLinux isn't quite the same thing as WINE, since andLinux actually loads 
the full Linux kernel, but andLinux does make Linux apps<i>look</i> like 
they're running natively on Windows. In other words, they behave somewhat like 
Windows apps running in the &quot;Coherence Mode&quot; ofParallels or 
&quot;Unity mode&quot; ofVMWare on the Mac. </p> 
<p>Under the hood, andLinux uses CoLinux as its core. CoLinux is an unholy 
merger of Windows and the Linux kernel, and is not an emulated PC. As with 
WINE, the fact that it's not emulated means you get a significant performance 
boost.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that andLinux is a beta and may have some rough edges, but if 
you're dying to get Linux and Windows playing nice, it should do the job.</p> 
<h3> Installation</h3> 
<p>There are some basic install instructions at the andLinux website. However, 
Adam Pash over at Lifehacker has put togethera much better tutorial showing you 
how to install KDE Ubuntu with andLinux.</p> 
<p>Once you have things installed and configured, everything runs quite 
seamlessly -- you can install new Linux apps with Synaptic and you even get 
some right-click context menus in Windows to open files in Linux applications.
</p> 
<p><b>Tip:</b> andLinux lets you choose how much system memory you want to 
dedicate to Linux. The installer recommends 192MB, but give it 512MB more if 
you have the memory to spare.</p> 
<p><b>Tip:</b> Ubuntu will install with several key apps (browser, media 
player, e-mail client) but if you want more, use the Synaptic installer to 
browse downloadable programs. Synaptic is accessible through the KDE start menu 
which now shows up in Windows' system tray (in the lower-right, next to the 
clock).</p> 
<h2> Wubi</h2> <br>

<p>Another option is to use Wubi, which installs the latest stable release of 
Ubuntu on your Windows machine. The installer was originally intended to draw 
in the curious by letting you run Ubuntu Linux on a Windows machine without 
actually having to install a second operating system. But it has the 
side-effect of allowing you to run Linux apps within a Windows environment.</p> 
<h2> Cygwin</h2> 
<p>Cygwin is another possibility. It provides a good deal of Linux 
functionality and APIs via a DLL. It allows you to compile Linux applications 
that don't have a Windows version.</p> 
<h2> Ulteo Virtual Desktop</h2> 
<p>With Ulteo Virtual Desktop, you just have to run the application you need 
to use from the Ulteo panel and its window will show up like any other Windows 
application.</p> 
<h2> The other way around: Windows apps on Linux</h2> 
<p>If you're looking to the opposite -- Windows apps running in a 
&quot;Coherence Mode&quot; style window on Linux -- trythis tutorial, which 
uses VirtualBox to do roughly the same thing.</p> 
<p><b>Tip:</b> Apparently, VirtualBox's seamless mode doesn't work with Compiz 
desktop effects running, so be sure to turn them off if you encounter problems.
