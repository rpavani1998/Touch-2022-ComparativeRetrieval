<h3>Don't Get Me Wrong, Linux Sucks as Much as Windows</h3>  By Carla Schroder 
on June 4, 2009 10:46 PM | Permalink | Comments (67) | TrackBacks (1) <br>
 I 
may be more aware of current FUD, disinformation, and anti-Linux propaganda 
trends because of my job. I visit dozens of Web sites every day and read all 
kinds of blogs, news, articles, and reader comments. So in case you hadn't 
noticed, here is the latest hot trend in anti-Linux baloney: supposed Linux 
fans and advocates who really really love Linux and have been using it for 
years, but can't recommend it for anyone else because &quot;It's not 
ready.&quot;
<p> </p>  If anyone challenges this is assertion, the Linux &quot;fan&quot; 
trots out all kinds of edge cases proving that Linux is not for anyone but 
elite geeks: no Photoshop, no Autocad, no 
$obscure-bit-of-very-specialized-software used by eight or ten people.
<p> If someone challenges this escalating silliness and illogic with the 
sensible response, which is that people who need those applications obviously 
need to keep a Mac or Windows box around; but for the much larger number of 
users whose needs are met by the tens of thousands of available Linux apps it's 
not an obstacle, the trump card-- ok so it's not much of a trump card, but then 
if they were smart they wouldn't be propagating nonsense-- is &quot;I hate 
computers and all operating systems suck.&quot;</p> 
<p> Um. OK. It's also amusing to me how hard the astroturf brigades work to 
denigrate Linux, and yet with the same breath claim that it is insignificant. 
Until Digg did away with shouts, for one example, organized troll gangs buried 
many Linux stories, especially the ones that got popular and made the front 
page. That's a lot of effort against an insignificant OS.</p> 
<p> What I notice most of all, and this has been true for years, is how 
negative the Microsoft trolls and astroturfers are. Can you recall the last 
time you read any positive comparisons, where the Windows fans said 
&quot;Windows has these great features and I like them.&quot; I can't. It's all 
about tearing down.</p> 
<h3>Microsoft's Business Practices Hurt Everyone</h3> The one big thing I 
don't get is why anyone would be a fan of Microsoft? Is it billionaire worship, 
the idea that any random robber baron is worth worshiping? Microsoft hurts 
everyone. DRM, stifled innovation, collusion with hardware vendors, worldwide 
malware damage in the tens of billions of dollars every year, price fixing, 
hardware fixing, corrupting legislative and standards bodies, no real 
competition except Linux-- why on earth would any rational person find that 
admirable?

<p>The next question that follows.</p> 
<p>Many Microsoft cyber warriors are obviously volunteer evangelists, who 
knows what is their motivation.</p> 
<p>But, does Microsoft actually employ a room full of bloggers who roam the 
net making negative comments? The sheer unrelenting intensity of comment makes 
you wonder. And the same comments over and over. It does not matter how many 
times a GNU/Linux advocate points out that the command line is not required to 
install software or configure the system, someone always jumps in with a too 
hard because of command line comment. And do not bother with any retort about 
the Windows shell, it will be ignored.</p> 
<p>In nearly every story of Linux on netbooks some clown will pipe up with 
&quot;but Linux can't play games&quot;, as if anyone in their right mind would 
play 3d games on a netbook. And even with the new Nvidia Ion based netbooks the 
gamers will still only be a tiny percentage - and welcome to use XP (no one 
makes you change). Ditto the full version of Photoshop.</p> 
<p>I also wonder how many Ubuntu baggers, who claim to be Debian or Fedora 
fans, are really just doing Microsoft's dirty work. If you start discussing 
anything deep or technical they usually stop posting or resort to ranting about 
nothing.</p> 
<p>Calm, rational response is the only way to answer.</p> June 4, 2009 8:14 PM 
<br>  Richard Chapman said: <br>

<p>I know there's a script they use. So many comments have the same phrases, 
use a similar approach. There is another aspect of this cybercombat: We are 
allegedly outnumbered 89 to 1, yet we often outnumber them in the comment 
sections. What's up with that? Could it be the Linux percentage of the desktop 
is much larger than &quot;almost 1%&quot;? I have another theory (not that we 
are not larger than 1%). Windows users mostly don't know or even care what they 
are using. That leaves the Microsoft partners do defend their beloved income.

<p><i>&quot;Many Microsoft cyber warriors are obviously volunteer evangelists, 
who knows what is their motivation.?</i></p> 
<p>As far as their motivation is concerned, I have this pet theory. A lot of 
these anti-Linux zealots happen to be &quot;power users&quot; and &quot;Windows 
gurus&quot;. They know every trick, DLL and registry hack like the backs of 
their hands, and they sort of like their view from the top. They've got so much 
time, mindshare and (probably) money invested in the Microsoft ecosystem that 
these folks are firmly entrenched.</p> 
<p>Now comes this (relatively speaking) new kid on the block in the form of 
Linux. It's fully capable of doing everything Windows does (and more), does it 
so much more efficiently, and doesn't cost a darned thing (in most cases). If 
Linux were to ever catch on and reach critical mass then these same gurus and 
power users would have to basically start over right back at the bottom of the 
learning curve with the rest of the great unwashed masses; plus, there's the 
possibility that all their time, money and mindshare was wasted on an inferior 
product.</p> 
<p>Some folks' egos just can't take that kind of hit.</p> June 4, 2009 11:48 PM

<p>I have been using Ubuntu since 4.10. I have been using Debian and Ubuntu 
almost exclusively for about 3 years. I now use 8.04 LTS on my Dell 1420.</p> 
<p>I work as a volunteer for a charity. I check and repair donated computers 
that are put into our store and sold at very reasonable prices. The computers 
are usually PIII 800 and above. Recently I put a computer in the store for $20 
with 512 MB memory and a 10 GB hard drive with Ubuntu 9.04 installed. It ran 
fine on the bench but when they hooked it to a monitor in the store the whole 
video went bad. If this happens every time monitors are changed I sure can't 
recommend or use Ubuntu for the public.</p> 
<p>Yes, I did try to reconfigure xorg which made things much worse. No, I 
wouldn't expect any of our customers to know how to reconfigure xorg. There 
might be solutions but there are no REAL WORLD solutions.</p>

<p>Eh, I try not to worry too much about it.</p> 
<p>But then I think it's silly to prosthelytize either for or against an 
operating system anyway. Most of us are not going to change someone's mind 
about their desktop preference anyway. It's software, not a religion or 
political party. Choose what's right for you and let the technology stand on 
its own merits.</p> June 5, 2009 12:08 AM <br>

<p>Tow-three years back I was curios, what is free linux and the much hyped 
quote &quot;Free as in beer&quot;. I tried knoppix and after sometime ubuntu.
</p> 
<p>Frankly speacking I am not a geek and want to use something which I can 
install out of box without using linux scripting or any customization.</p> 
<p>My experience with Linux:<br>
 Knoppix got installed but was giving me some 
problem with sound card and wifi [deliberatly I have not mentioned my laptop 
brand/model here].<br>
 I was bit frustrated due tot the above I did not have a 
LAN cord which I can use to connect and then do some fix. I had to go back to 
windows to do the research. BAD ENOUGH</p> 
<p>Then came ubuntu, live cd itself detected everything and I was statisfied 
and installed it. Everything was perfect, except volume was very low.</p> 
<p>Now comes the real obvious trouble, I was not able to play many music and 
video file formats nor my favourite DVDs.</p> 
<p>My question why is it so, it works on windows, Mac software why not on 
linux. I know what linux cult(sorry to use this word but linux geek should be 
proud of this) will say, legally they will say that these are propritery 
formats, so that's not free and can not be included in the free distribution. I 
agree totally with that because even this free is not charity just like google 
providing 1 GB of free mailbox space.</p> 
<p>Other people will say you can use some packages and download them and it 
will work for all the music format and dvd, but that is illigal in some (read 
some as many) contries.</p> 
<p>Other problem, ubuntu 7 worked on my laptop but when I installed the latest 
version, it did not recognized my graphic card and started in command mode, it 
was enough for me to stop then and there itself.</p> 
<p>These days many OEM are coming up with pre installed linux machines, that's 
a good news, I have not used any till now but can you tell me whether all the 
avi, mpg etc which runs on windows will run on that?????</p> 
<p>I also request the whole linux community not to taint windows but to 
improve linux distros, these days I am fiding that while opening some file, few 
distros hangs and I need to close them forcefully. Isn't linux going in the 
same direction as windows (leave cost factor here)</p> 
<p>Lastly you should give windows at least the credit which made computers for 
everyone with it GUI front, apple guys may say we have better gui but that is 
another discussion in itself.</p> 
<p>Also please let me know if microsoft opens its code to the community how 
linux guru will react? Are they going to embrace that as part of strong linux 
open community or will that also have same community support as open solaris.

 Ex-Microsoft marketing manager said: <br>

<p>Of course Microsoft has a perception management team and specifically 
targets Web 2.0 sites like Digg and Reddit. Some of this is outsourced as well. 
It is felt inside MS that the reason why Vista failed was that on Web 2.0 sites 
it became fashionable to bad mouth the OS, this turned in to group think and 
thus the OS failed. Seriously, that is the belief and there is at least some 
merit to it. Lets be real, Vista is just not as bad as it is painted.</p> 
<p>Now contrast that to Windows 7; Microsoft have spent a lot of money 
manipulating user generated content sites to hype the OS. Let me tell you, it 
is not so much different from Vista but the perception is that is it much 
better. Again, lets be real, Windows 7 is just Vista with some UI tweaks and 
[b]much[/b] better marketing.</p> 
<p>Watch for the talking points used, this is starting now but will be pushed 
harder after Win7 is released, I would expect &quot;Windows 7 is the death blow 
to Linux on the desktop&quot; will be a favourite.</p> 
<p>I think it is poor form for MS to manipulate sites like Digg, there will be 
a backlash when the users figure it out.</p> June 5, 2009 2:26 AM <br>

Bezemer said: <br>

<p>I have a blog that is notoriously pro-Linux and pro-FOSS. It helps when you 
counter an argument posed by these astroturfers by providing proof and links to 
sites that debunk that argument. In that case, astroturfing simply backfires.
</p> 
<p>For that purpose I have a database with links to counter most arguments. 
Research? I got one. Technical excellence? I got one. Innovation? I got one.</p>
<p>Ridiculing the SOFUD helps too. I've published a few posts on that one and 
keep them for reference when some dodo comes along and tries the same old 
trick. Just keep on bashing, it shuts them up, believe me.</p>

<p>@Saurabh</p> 
<p>Give Mandriva One a try. It might just meet your needs.<br>
 It's free, it 
has all the proprietary drivers in with it and it astonishingly easy to install.
</p> 
<p>The second part of the answer is this - a &quot;vanilla install&quot; (just 
an install from the Windows setup disk) of Windows will leave you with a 
largely unusable system. Many third party drivers and addons would be needed 
for the &quot;full functionality&quot; that you think of as &quot;out of the 
box&quot; behaviour for Windows.</p> 
<p>Microsoft are a grubby bunch. They drag the whole tone of IT down to gutter 
level with their furious insistence on everything being on their terms.</p>

<p>GNU Linux is getting more and more popular, GNU Linux does not need 
promotion. But as long as more computers are not sold with Linux built-in the 
progression will be slow.</p> June 5, 2009 3:18 AM <br>

<p>Lord Keynes, in the 1930's, understood the issue. Regarding economic issues 
and the quest for &quot;enough&quot;, he said that in order for everyone to be 
rich, it was necessary &quot;..to pretend to ourselves and to everyone that 
fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and 
usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still.&quot; Quotes 
from EF Schumaker's &quot;Small is Beautiful,&quot; a book which perhaps should 
be distributed as part of the GPL!</p>

<p>&quot;this escalating silliness&quot;</p> 
<p>Silliness? Sorry, but if you *NEED* Autocad or Photoshop for your job, 
Linux is *NOT* an option. Yes, not everybody needs those applications, but 
that's another story. There are many things you can't do with Linux, or that if 
you can do, are very limited (e.g. video editing, watching TV, using 
proprietary formats required because of your job, etc...)</p> 
<p>&quot;needs are met by the tens of thousands of available Linux apps&quot;
</p> 
<p>Regular people don't need millions of useless apps. They need just a 
handful of basic apps that do what they need. Give me Adobe Premiere, an 
application that can edit .psd files send from my customers, a driver for my 
DVB-T card, a nice DVB player such as DVBViewer (I don't want Totem or Kaffeine 
crap), and MS Office (no, I won't use OpenOffice to save .doc files with broken 
layout), give me *JUST THAT* and I'll use Linux to please you.</p> 
<p>&quot;That's a lot of effort against an insignificant OS.&quot;</p> 
<p>It's not a lot of effort. It's just that many people disagree with such 
disinformation and want it to stop. If you like Linux, fine, but don't say 
anyone can use it. This is just not true.</p> 
<p>&quot;The one big thing I don't get is why anyone would be a fan of 
Microsoft&quot;</p> 
<p>Errrr...Maybe because it just works? I love my Vista computer and my 
familiar applications because I can do my job conveniently in a familiar 
environment.</p> 
<p>&quot;Is it billionaire worship, the idea that any random robber baron is 
worth worshiping?&quot;</p> 
<p>Not really. Who cares about Bill Gates? LOL...Now, I know *THIS* is 
important for Linux fans. They hate people who make money. Go figure...</p> 
<p><br>
 &quot;Microsoft hurts everyone.&quot;</p> 
<p>Really?</p> 
<p>&quot;DRM, stifled innovation, collusion with hardware vendors&quot;</p> 
<p>They're a company, they're not a non-profit like ;)</p> 
<p>&quot;worldwide malware damage in the tens of billions of dollars every 
year&quot;</p> 
<p>Microsoft? Not virus authors?</p> 
<p>&quot;no real competition except Linux&quot;</p> 
<p>Microsoft's fault? BTW, Linux can't be considered competition with barely 
1% market share, despite trying to convince it's desktop-ready for more than a 
decade...LOL.</p> June 5, 2009 4:08 AM <br>

<p>@Earl - You sound like a perfect example of the subject of this blog post.
<br> I think you're lying about how long you've used Ubuntu.So - you've never 
changed a monitor before then, because that is what you are implying.<br>

<p>@saurabh<br>
 for your first point the answer is rather simple a free linux 
distro can't pay for the licenses to distribute the codecs required for 
multimedia, however as a quick google would have showed you they are available 
and easily installed.<br>
 Secondly the OEM installed linuxes do have the 
necessary codec to play multimedia files.<br>
 Thirdly Windows didn create the 
first gui pc<br>
 Fourthly MS will never opensource windows and if they did the 
code is so bad I doubt many would bother with it</p> June 5, 2009 4:19 AM <br>

<p>That there's a subtle change in approach is obvious and I agree that we 
more frequently nowadays sees this &quot;I love it and I wished I could use for 
more than a nice hobby&quot;. It's pretty close to what in other circumstances 
has been labelled &quot;Master suppression techniques&quot;. What I also have 
seen though is how Linux users are becoming more confident and hence more 
shrewd in their responses.</p> 
<p>I don't know if my own response is particularly shrewd, but sometimes I 
simply avoid defending anything even how ridiculous the claims are and answer 
something similar to the headline of this article: &quot;Linux sucks, Windows 
sucks, but for my needs Linux sucks less&quot;. In other circumstances I'm 
referring to Linux as a set of tools: &quot;this is what I need and these are 
my options, and as seen Linux does it more effeciently, if it doesn't meet your 
needs don't use it and choose something that does&quot;. My point is that those 
folks aren't interested in anything related to anyone's real computing but 
prefer to spin hypothetical claims, that might be true to some degree but in 
the bigger picture are quite irrelative. As [i]GregE[/i] wrote, the calm 
response is better, and for readers I suppose the honest ones will be able to 
easier pick up things like &quot;this feature work great in Linux&quot; or 
&quot;this solution is both cost and performance effective&quot; instead of 
gorilla growls.</p> 
<p>Personally I don't care if 1% or 10% use Linux. If it is as healthy as 
today and yesterday with a fraction of the desktop market it's a solid product. 
In my home Linux stands for 3 of 5 systems, and the other two are one Windows 
and one BSD system. At my work it's 3 Windows and one Linux and one BSD. At 
work the number of Linux boxes could be higher and might become since several 
&quot;Windows&quot; tasks easily can be handled by a terminal server. We're 
only talking about tools, damn it!</p> 
<p>...</p> 
<p>Just a couple of thoughts concerning some questions here:</p> 
<p>- for patent protected codecs feel free to buy Mandriva or Suse Linux, in 
case you don't want to or your concious tells you it against the law of your

<p>- monitors, especially older CTR with less standard refresh rates, can be 
tricky to use with modern systems. I've had that problem in both Linux and 
Windows. The only issue I've ever had with a black screen in recent years is 
however with Windows, since a quite standard configuration of a Tyan 
motherboard and ATi/AMD integrated graphic card forced me to push F8 and choose 
VGA (800x600) until I got proprietary graphic drivers installed. There's a 
reason why Microsoft is &quot;very generous&quot; with the testing of Windows 7 
(count the numbers running Windows 7 RC or Beta and you have a huge number of 
folks voluntarily hammering out flaws in the system; still some will encounter 
problem with the final product since the configuration options of hardware is 
numerous).</p> June 5, 2009 4:53 AM <br>

<p>I have been evaluating Linux distro's for about ten years and have found 
none that work very well. Yes, you can get Linux to work if you are a computer 
geek with spare time. Ubuntu is very popular, but hardly ready to run 'out of 
the box.' After the hassle with codec's for mp3 and mpg files; a hassle with 
'no-audio' for an Audigy sound card; and the hassles with nVidia drivers that 
won't activate, I gave up.</p> 
<p>Years ago, Linux would rarely crash, but WinXP would crash daily. Today, I 
find the opposite. For some reason, most distro's will just hang doing simple 
things. I would love to drop M$ and use only Linux but I doult that will be 
possible. Linux is difficult to use, has no 'OS' standards, lacks distro 
compatibility, and lacks working drivers for a lot of hardware.</p> 
<p>For me, the best distro's are (1) PclinxOS, (2) Mint 7, and Puppy. Slax is 
also good but on pendrive, it has been unstable. Boot-up gets corrupted and 
fails. I am sending this comment for Slax; first bootup froze changing font 
size; wifi has disconnected twice before I could 'submit.' WinXP-SP3 sure works 
better.</p> June 5, 2009 6:37 AM <br>

<p>The issue I have as a windows non-hater (I don't love it but it works fine 
for me) is how everyone who uses linux tries to shove it down everyone's throat 
(and then brag about all you have to do all day is comment on crap like this).
</p> 
<p>It's out there in the market in open play and it's still losing. I 
understand (and tbh don't care) that someday it may become the standard but at 
the moment the mass don't want it.</p> 
<p>I use both but choose Windows as my main operating system because the fact 
is there IS MORE AVAILABLE FOR THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM than is out there 
for Linux.</p> 
<p>Windows was there first and has become the standard which everyone has 
created applications for. Regardless of how amazing an OS is (or not) at the 
end of the day it's really the applications that people care about.</p> June 5,

 You state in your post that windows can play DVD's out of the 
box, this is not true. Windows almost always comes preinstalled and 
preconfigured from the producer, along with DVD software. Also, if you have 
installed Windows as many times as I have, you know that there is a lot more 
stuff that doesn't work correctly out of the box.<br>
 I use and like Windows 7 
along with my preferred Ubuntu 9.04, but that is due to games and specialized 
software that people haven't made for Linux yet.</p> June 5, 2009 8:25 AM <br>

it personalized just for you, keep on using what the mass uses.</p>

difference is that any 8 years old kid knows how to fix it on the blue screen

<p>If I understand your comment correctly I believe you would like to thank 
Xerox for the GUI. If you can, check out the video Triumph of the Nerds found 
here:http://www.shoppbs.org/product/index.jsp?productId=1978852 (not associated

ideas from them but MS beat them to the punch on releasing it. Woz has 
repeatedly said that Jobs is not technical. He's all about looks, style and 
marketing. (there is some debate to how much is original given how much his 
products mimic a certain Brawn designer of past; draw your own conclusions) No 
matter what, looking at Apple stock and such you can say he is very good at 
selling and marketing.</p> 
<p>So as you can see, most technology that both MS and Apple are using today 
was not created by them. they are marketing companies with Apple doing a much 
better job in that area. CoverFlow on the apple, bought and paid for. Their OS, 
has BSD in it. MS has a bunch of things in it which were &quot;obtained&quot; 
in a rather (how do I say this nicely?) immoral way in which very small start

 b. nerds = bad<br>
 c. rich people = talented, 
hard working, etc. people<br>
 d. celebrity = to be worshipped and followed.<br>
 e. thinking = bad</p> 
<p>Now, we have:</p> 
<p>a. Windows is expensive -&gt; it is good<br>
 b. Free/open source software 
is from nerds -&gt; it is bad<br>
 c. Bill Gates is both rich and a celebrity 
-&gt; he must be REALLY good<br>
 d. GNU/Linux is free -&gt; it MUST be bad<br>

 e. GNU/Linux offers choice -&gt; thinking -&gt; bad bad bad</p> 
<p>Thus, everyone buys in those propaganda, and no matter what we, GNU/Linux

<p>Anyway, I have stopped worrying about market share for GNU/Linux. I am

<p> Your post is not worth responding to, but I just wanted to let you know

<p>First of all, let me just say that I've been using some flavor of Linux 
exclusively for many years now, and I can tell you that it is ready for the 
desktop, but *only* the desktop of someone who knows what they're doing. Let me 
tell you why, in no particular order.</p> 
<p>1. Music support (MP3) and video support (everything from DVD's to many 
formats designed for Windows or Apple) that are missing because of legal 
restrictions. Easy to get around, but the first step is knowing that you have 
to do so, and the second is locating the &quot;illegal&quot; add-ons.</p> 
<p>2. Support is missing for many WiFi cards. Fixing this is never easy 
(although it's better than it used to be).</p> 
<p>3. Some hardware may require Windows. A while back I tried to get a printer 
working that required you to run a Windows program in the background (it used a 
proprietary driver). I managed to get it working smoothly with Linux, but it 
wasn't easy.</p> 
<p>4. Things stop working, usually due to software updates and patches. This 
happens with Windows sometimes, too, but the solution is usually for the 
clueless user to download an EXE from the web and run it -- problem solved. In 
Linux, you can end up digging through a mountain of /etc configuration files, 
typing in a lot of mumbo jumbo on a command line, and even offering up animal 
sacrifices by the pale moon light (that last seems to work better than the 
other two). Simple upgrades can remove features without warning (how many 
people actually read the description of every change that is offered, and how 
many times does that description say &quot;description not yet 
available&quot;?).</p> 
<p>Don't get me wrong, I prefer Linux. I like what it does, and the way it 
works. It puts me in complete control of the computer. I've learned to live 
with the frustrations (like when KDE, in an effort to become just as ugly and 
dysfunctional as Vista, released a broken &quot;alpha&quot; version labeled as 
a full-bodied release) and the problems, but an ordinary user wouldn't. My 
wife, the computer n00b, wouldn't know where to begin. Not even my high-tech 
teenage son would have the patience. He has better things to do with his time 
than the care and feeding of his computer.</p> 
<p>Linux is not for everyone. It's for the DIY crowd, the techies like myself 
who can deal with it, and don't mind the occasional inconveniences.</p> June 5,

 Victor J Kinzer said: <br>

<p>While I really wish I could agree with this post I'm going to have to come 
out and say that Linux is still not quite ready. It's really really close, and 
every time I install a new distro most of the problems I had in the past have 
been taken care of and I run into a couple whole new ones.</p> 
<p>Here's the thing, I am not going to complain about weird obscure software. 
I am totally with the author that most people don't need that high end stuff. 
The number of people who &quot;need&quot; photoshop to resize images, optimize 
them for the web and get rid of red eye makes my brain bleed. Photoshop is for 
high end image production, and that's where it should stay.</p> 
<p>My complaints have to do with two simple phenomenon. 1 hardware 
regressions. I cannot count the number of times I run a version of a distro, 
wipe and do a clean install of a newer version (I will not upgrade because that 
makes this issue worse), and find that hardware that worked beautifully out of 
box before is now broken. It has happened with wireless cards, audio cards, web 
cams, and even video cards across more upgrades than I can count. This is not a 
minor issue, this is a HUGE problem, and because drivers are built into the 
kernel it's usually either an impossible fix, or well into crazy command line 
world to fix. I am fairly comfortable in command line and some of the driver 
fix stuff makes my head spin, so your average user is going to be plum out of 
luck. Windows does support FAR less software out of the box than linux. However 
75% of the time if it doesn't work out of the box it's a simple wizard style 
installer and a reboot away from working. The other 25% of the time the 
supplier will just say &quot;sorry, you're out of luck. Go buy a different 
printer/scanner/webcam/whatever. While annoying I honestly prefer that answer 
to a million tutorials put together by hackers that provide a glimmer of hope 
to users who don't realize till 3 days and 20 hours of actual work later that 
they lack the technical skill to make their hardware work, and have to go buy 
new hardware anyway. Call me old fashioned. This syndrome needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Problem 2: General desktop performance. Linux is a great OS as a whole. 
Overall it runs much more quickly than windows. The problem is that 
&quot;overall&quot; word. Linus will not do multiple customized kernels, which 
I understand from a development hours standpoint. The people throwing money 
into the kernel have server businesses. Ok, so the server gets focus, which 
makes sense, and Linux is a KILLER server. W00t. Now I have installed it as a 
desktop and want to run Hulu on Flash in Firefox. . . Oh, well I'm sorry about 
that, but you see performance on that particular issue is a little. . . less 
than ideal. When I throw linux on a desktop I am always blown away by how 
wonderful the general system responsiveness is. There is very little overhead, 
and as an operating environment it blows Windows out of the water. Application 
performance, especially consumer application performance sucks. There is just 
no nice way to say it. Flash video performance is hideous, and my computer is 
plugged into my TV. Hulu is my cable. I have tried various tweaks to improve 
performance, I have tried running windows in a VM so I can at least stay booted 
into Linux, that kills performance as well. There is just no good way to get it 
to run. General Firefox browsing performance suffers similarly, though that is 
improving. OpenOffice loads more quickly in Windows, the list goes on. These 
are not obscure issues, with weird programs only a few people use. These are 
mainstream consumer program issues, and they are unacceptable. How long did it 
take before the linux desktop could properly do fullscreen flash video?</p> 
<p>Every year these issues are less than the year before, but they refuse to 
go away entirely. They need to if we want to make real progress on the desktop. 
If someone like me to keeps trying to replace my windows desktop, and is fairly 
comfortable in the command line keeps going back to windows then the mainstream 
user sure as hell isn't going to make that leap.</p> June 5, 2009 10:41 AM <br>

<p>In reference to <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
 Tow-three years back I was curios, what is free linux and the much 
hyped quote &quot;Free as in beer&quot;. I tried knoppix and after sometime 
ubuntu.</p> 
<p>Frankly speacking I am not a geek and want to use something which I can 
install out of box without using linux scripting or any customization.</p> 
<p>My experience with Linux:<br>
 Knoppix got installed but was giving me some 
problem with sound card and wifi [deliberatly I have not mentioned my laptop 
brand/model here].<br>
 I was bit frustrated due tot the above I did not have a 
LAN cord which I can use to connect and then do some fix. I had to go back to 
windows to do the research. BAD ENOUGH</p> 
<p>Then came ubuntu, live cd itself detected everything and I was statisfied 
and installed it. Everything was perfect, except volume was very low.</p> 
<p>Now comes the real obvious trouble, I was not able to play many music and 
video file formats nor my favourite DVDs.</p> 
<p>My question why is it so, it works on windows, Mac software why not on 
linux. I know what linux cult(sorry to use this word but linux geek should be 
proud of this) will say, legally they will say that these are propritery 
formats, so that's not free and can not be included in the free distribution. I 
agree totally with that because even this free is not charity just like google 
providing 1 GB of free mailbox space.</p> 
<p>Other people will say you can use some packages and download them and it 
will work for all the music format and dvd, but that is illigal in some (read 
some as many) contries.</p> 
<p>Other problem, ubuntu 7 worked on my laptop but when I installed the latest 
version, it did not recognized my graphic card and started in command mode, it 
was enough for me to stop then and there itself.</p> 
<p>These days many OEM are coming up with pre installed linux machines, that's 
a good news, I have not used any till now but can you tell me whether all the 
avi, mpg etc which runs on windows will run on that?????</p> 
<p>I also request the whole linux community not to taint windows but to 
improve linux distros, these days I am fiding that while opening some file, few 
distros hangs and I need to close them forcefully. Isn't linux going in the 
same direction as windows (leave cost factor here)</p> 
<p>Lastly you should give windows at least the credit which made computers for 
everyone with it GUI front, apple guys may say we have better gui but that is 
another discussion in itself.</p> 
<p>Also please let me know if microsoft opens its code to the community how 
linux guru will react? Are they going to embrace that as part of strong linux 
open community or will that also have same community support as open solaris.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
 Many, many years ago I tried fedora core2. By my standards 
at the time it was a beast of an os that just did not measure up to my 
standards and all the help i got was command line this or that. over the years 
i tried Linux here and there and finally toyed with the *buntu family, it 
worked for me, until i borked it by my own doing... in fact now that i think 
about it the only way i learned about windows, Linux, or BSD was by trying 
something that was above my level of knowledge and having to reinstall or fix 
the darn thing, but i found that i could either invest my time in (1)installing 
ubuntu (or any distro)and fixing the couple little hiccups or (2) installing 
windows, updating for a few hours, tracking down the drivers for my (not so) 
exotic hardware either way there's an investment of time and energy.<br>
<br>

<br><br>
 as far as dvd and restricted media playback, a little research will 
do you some good, as far as i am aware a vanilla windows disc does not include 
dvd or proprietary formats either, unless provided by your OEM there are 
programs like vlc etc. that will give you that ability (legally as far as i am 
aware) on both platforms!</p> 
<p>wireless.... lets just say that a wide variety of cards are actively being 
added to distributions list of working hardware, if those venders would release 
even closed source linux drivers the world would be a better place,</p> 
<p>as to whether OEMs add support restricted formats, that is up to them, dell 
adds in support for dvds and ... possibly others.</p> 
<p>Not sure what you mean by (taint windows) 98% of us are only speaking from 
personal experiences that can be reproduced and has been documented.</p> 
<p>if Microsoft opens its code in a truly free as in speech and beer way i 
will personally clean every bathroom and train car in grand central station 
from top to bottom with my toung! then afterwords I believe many of us would be 
cautious for good reason for a while then possibly embrace it first in pieces 
and maybe one day in whole. Certainly it could only benefit from this treatment 
from a coding standpoint. from a price standpoint it would stand to loose quite 
a bit of revenue mainly because they do not do all of their own tech support 
and to guarantee more frequent calls they would have to break everything by 
implementing new technologies every year or two.</p> 
<p>long story short, that is not happening. </p> June 5, 2009 10:47 AM <br>

<p>&quot;In Linux, you can end up digging through a mountain of /etc

<p>Still whining about KDE4? so demand a refund. Did that deprive you of the

excellent desktop environments available at the click of the install button. 
When something breaks in Windows you have no options but to wait for it to be 
fixed, and you pay money for this 'privilege.'</p> 
<p>Your 'ordinary users' don't install Windows, or new hardware, or try to fix 
things. Your 'ordinary users' only advantage with Windows is years of 
familiarity. Your 'ordinary users' should not be allowed to download and 
install random EXEs, that is insanely stupid. No version of Windows comes with 
a substantial set of hardware drivers, it's often a separate installation. And 
quite often a ridiculous one-- look at how many USB devices install their own 
USB drivers. USB is standard protocol and doesn't need special drivers. Dumb 
and it creates problems. Your 'ordinary users' need plenty of support to keep 
their Windows boxes functional. A well-setup Linux system is magnitudes more 
reliable than any Windows system, and much easier to support.</p> 
<p>Windows is so evil and inflexible it's not funny. I had the bright idea to 
set up some family members with Ubuntu PCs running Windows in a virtual 
machine. Well guess what-- their Windows disks were not the full retail 
versions, but restore disks. I managed to install some of them in the VMs, but 
it was hellish. Stupid stupid stupid. At any rate they now have Ubuntu for Web 
surfing, email, and a lot of everyday tasks, and Windows for when they want to 
use some particular Windows application. I don't let Windows anywhere near any 
network.</p>

<p>OK I just have to chime in on this.</p> 
<p>I LOVE and use Linux every day at home. So does the wife. I replaced the OS 
on her computer a year ago and now she has not missed a single application 
(except for a few games). I bought her a Nintendo DS and that problem was 
solved.</p> 
<p>I NEED MicroSoft Windows in order to make my living. I spend 80% of my 
working day &quot;fixing&quot; these broken systems that are infected with 
malware and the other 20% reading logs and reports about the latest 
&quot;infections&quot; coming down the road.</p> 
<p>All of us in the IT community must do our best to keep MicroSoft alive. The 
world economy is at stake here guys! If they lose, so do the Anti-virus 
software people, the Anti-spyware people, and the poor folks in Nigeria (419), 
Europe/Asia/South America that are currently making a living off of the 
unwashed masses' credit history and gullibility.</p> 
<p>So if some one tries to convince you switch to Linux DON'T DO IT!!!! Stay 
with what you are &quot;comfortable&quot; and &quot;familiar&quot; with. Keep 
using Adobe products and Internet Explorer! Oh and by the way, please get a 
copy of Anti-virus software (don't forget the annual subscriptions!), 
anti-malware (more subscriptions) and a PERSONAL FIREWALL (guess what, it costs 
every year too). All of us in the industry thank you, but please pay us in cash 
as your credit cards are probably useless.</p> June 5, 2009 12:12 PM <br>

<p>If Linux is ever going to make significant gains in market share, the 
community needs to listen to criticism rather than write it all off as M$ FUD. 
While there are certainly pro-MS people putting down Linux either under 
Microsoft's employ or of their own accord, there are also a lot of real people 
with no agenda that have used or currently do use Linux and have problems with 
it.</p> 
<p>To think that everyone that criticizes Linux is working for MS is just 
tin-foil hat insanity and can only stifle Linux's progress. This closed-minded, 
open-source McCarthyism is far more damaging to Linux and the community than 
anything the Microsoft trolls can do.</p> 
<p>I won't even bother listing any reasons why I feel Linux isn't quite there 
yet, since I'll just be (probably already have been) written off as some evil 
Microsoft employee.</p> June 5, 2009 1:58 PM <br>

<p>I've been an avid Linux user for over 10 years, and there are several 
recurring patterns in the propaganda for it. One is, whenever anyone has 
anything negative to say about Linux, they're accused of being shills, 
astroturfers, FUDsters, trolls, etc. The end result is censorship. I am a real 
Linux user, not a Microsoft shill. Really.</p> 
<p>I love Linux, obviously. I hate Microsoft. But I have certain needs and 
skills that Linux works really well for. And I'm cool with not being able to 
run certain applications. I don't need them. I believe in Free Software, so I 
don't even run things like Flash, which sucks, but it's important to me not to 
support software which takes away my freedoms.</p> 
<p>I've tried recommending Linux (Ubuntu in particular) to my friends, and in 
all cases but one it has resulted in them not only going back to Windows or 
Mac, but actually getting turned off by Linux which will make it much harder 
for me to recommend it in the future when it improves. There's been too many 
boneheaded interface bugs, hardware not working (especially printers), and 
applications they have come to depend on not being available. When this stuff 
happens in Windows or Mac, they take it to the dealer and say &quot;fix 
it.&quot; Yes, Linux has great online communities, but ultimately, they have to 
figure it out themselves, and none of my friends have been cool with that. It's 
frustrating for me, because I see all the BS, viruses, and malware they have to 
deal with, but I'm trying to bite my tongue when I see that. I know there are 
trade-offs in our software choices, and I do think they've made the right 
trade-offs for them.</p> 
<p>For now, anyway. Linux has come a long ways. I keep waiting for it to be 
ready, but I've been waiting for over a decade now, and I'm starting to lose 
hope.</p> June 5, 2009 3:37 PM <br>

<p>&quot;It's not a lot of effort. It's just that many people disagree with 
such disinformation and want it to stop. If you like Linux, fine, but don't say 
anyone can use it. This is just not true.&quot;</p> 
<p>A lie is something that cannot be checked. Anyone can check for himself 
that a modern Linux distro like Ubuntu can be very easy to use. Lies cannot be 
validated, truth can. I invite anybody to check my statement about Ubuntu being 
a more than descent OS.</p> 
<p>The only way to make identify what's true and what's not without any 
possible mistake is by thinking and experimenting, NOT by reading.</p> 
<p>My advice : Read less, think/experiment more and you'll now the truth.</p>

<p>I won't argue about the home desktop, but a lot of people tend to use at 
home what they use at work or school, and Linux desktops aren't going into the 
enterprise until a couple of things happen: cost and support. Red Hat has fine 
support, but they are as expensive as Microsoft, so where is the business case 
to change? They dollar you to death on licensing and provisioning and anything 
else you want to do beyond a basic install. And we spent weeks trying to get 
help on a satellite server, but they refused when we wouldn't sign a contract 
that said they get paid whether it's successful or not. So we had to call in a 
third party. Scratch Red Hat. Suse is much less expensive to install and 
license, but their support isn't exactly stellar, and they do some stuff with 
their code that either isn't standard or doesn't work well, like having no way 
to add a new NIC driver during a network install to a new server! So if this 
much trouble occurs at the server level, where we're talking dozens to 
hundreds, what enterprise is even gong to try with desktops that could number 
in the thousands? Ain't going to happen. And as a result, people will keep 
windows at home as well...</p> June 5, 2009 4:46 PM <br>

<p>In my day Job I'm a Windows Programmer (C# ASP.NET VisualStudio Toolset, MS

even reads and edits any Photoshop files we get sent. We use Windows XP, Vista,

for Photoshop.</p> 
<p>So lets scratch that little furfie about the lack of Photoshop being a

<br> The Mad Hatter said: <br>

<p>Carla,</p> 
<p>This is not at all surprising. Entrepreneur shape their corporations in 
their own image. Some times this is good. Some times this is bad. Microsoft is 
a good example of an entrepreneur who is insecure, greedy, and lazy. This 
evaluation is based on Microsoft's actions as a corporation (I have never meet 
Bill Gates).</p> 
<p>Microsoft holds 90 percent of operating system pre-installs. But it is 
afraid of Linux (and it was afraid of Netscape, and is deathly afraid of 
Apple). Why? Considering their market share, Linux should be a minor irritant. 
Instead you get things like the &quot;Get the Facts Campaign&quot;, which was 
so totally ludicrous that they dropped it. But they dropped long after the 
damage was done - they made themselves a laughing stock with that campaign.</p> 
<p>Another example is the &quot;Laptop Hunters&quot; campaign. Why is 
Microsoft so scared of Apple? Apple's market share is so small, that the 
company is only a pimple on the face of IT. True, it's an expanding pimple, but 
6 percent? Why even dignify it with a response? Because they don't think they 
can compete with Apple. Heck, look at the Amazon top 100 list of computers. 
About the only ones that sell for more than $1000,00 are made by Apple. 
Microsoft doesn't think that they can deliver an operating system that will 
make a computer worth more that $1000,00 to consumers.</p> 
<p>And then there's ODF support, or should I say lack of support. Microsoft is 
the only ODF implementer that messed up the implementation. It wasn't for lack 
of talent, Microsoft has talented employees. Microsoft is scared of ODF, 
because it can be used (in implemented by a company that isn't deliberately 
trying to break it) in a wide range of software. No Lock-In. Microsoft doesn't 
want this. They want people to use Microsoft XML (Microsoft calls it Office 
Open XML, but while it may be used by Office, it isn't Open since it's 
impossible for anyone else to implement). If they are using Microsoft XML, they 
are locked into Microsoft Office. They are scared that given the option, people 
will use software from other vendors. They are so insecure that they don't 
believe that they can compete in the Office Suite market without lock in.</p> 
<p>Microsoft doesn't want component manufacturers to release their hardware 
specifications. If component manufacturers do release the specifications, 
another operating system might be able to use that hardware, and Microsoft 
doesn't believe that they can compete in the operating system market. So the 
company tries to avoid having to compete, but making it hard for other 
operating systems to use the hardware.</p> 
<p>Microsoft is greedy. Why would a company sell a sub-standard operating 
system (Windows Vista 7 for Netbooks) and encourage people to upgrade? Who 
would produce six different versions of the same operating system, with 
different capabilities, using 99.99% the same source code, and prices ranging 
from $114.00 to $340.00? Greed.</p> 
<p>Again, Microsoft is greedy. When they eliminated floppy disks as an install 
medium for compact discs the price of Windows increased, even though the 
install medium price dropped dramatically.</p> 
<p>Microsoft is lazy. Why offer 6 versions of desktop Windows, and 4 or 5 
versions of Server Windows, all of which use virtually the same source code? 
Often the only difference between versions is that one version has an 
artificial limit of some sort (such as number of users) while the next one 
doesn't. But it's easier to do that, than to design something that truly is 
different, with new features that would attract more customers.</p> 
<p>Microsoft is lazy. Rather than producing the best operating system in the 
world, one that would have users beating a path to their door, they produce an 
operating system that is pedestrian, and then try to block anyone else from the 
market by exclusionary deals and &quot;Marketing Bonuses&quot;.</p> 
<p>And of course we have the Internet. Microsoft would rather pay trolls to 
trash Linux and OSX, rather than producing something that is so much better 
than Linux or OSX, that you'd be crazy to use either. They would rather use 
advertising money to &quot;bend editorial views&quot; than produce something 
that reviewers would love.</p> 
<p>With the amount of talent that Microsoft employs, they should be able to 
totally blow away Apple, totally blow away Linux, and make users so happy that 
they'd be crazy to use anything other than Windows. They could do this. But 
they are too insecure, too greedy, and too lazy to do this.</p> 
<p>And if they don't change, it is going to kill the company. Read their SEC 
filings, the company is in bad shape. Not as bad as GM or Chrysler, but unless 
something is done, the company is headed for deep trouble. The current 
management team is a large part of this, They were hand picked by the company 
founder, and reflect his views. Steve Ballmer is a good salesman. He might be a 
great salesman. But as a company manager, he's terrible.</p> 
<p>So, yes. You get a lot of trolls. People who say, &quot;I've been running 
Linux for 5 years, and it's really not that good,&quot; because Microsoft would 
rather encourage trolls, than make a great product. If you check the Apple news 
sources and blogs, you see the exact same sort of posts, stating that OSX just 
doesn't work as well as Windows, that it doesn't support the right software, 
that it isn't really reliable, etc. Whether it's Linux or Apple that they are 
attacking, all of these people are lying. The proof is in the targets. 
Microsoft thinks that Apple and Linux are dangerous. They don't think that the 
BSD based operating systems are, so they don't get attacked in the same way, or 
at the same level. They don't think that Solaris is dangerous either, and 
you'll note in the Solaris blogs that you don't see this sort of attack very 
much either. You will if they decide either BSD or Solaris is dangerous.</p> 
<p>And it's a terrible waste. Because Microsoft, if it wanted, could produce 
something fantastic. They have the talent. They have the capabilities. They 
don't have the drive.</p> 
<p>Until they get the drive, I'll avoid using Microsoft products, and I'll 
advise others not to. And when I see trolls, I'll fight them in the forums. I 
hate dishonesty.<br>

<p>Hello, <br>
 First, sorry for my faulty english, not my native language.</p>
<p>The person named &quot;The Mad Hatter&quot; wrote very interesting things 
from my point of view. Nice comment his.</p> 
<p>All this scenarized FUD shows clearly in the &quot;It's better with 
windows&quot; Asus recent campaing. By a curious coincidence, a few days ago at 
&quot;Computex&quot; Taipei an Asus executive presented his apologies (to whom 
?) for having put on display a Netbook runing the Google &quot;Android&quot; OS.
</p> 
<p>It seems that Redmond holds Asus responsible for having lauched tiny budget 
laptops with Linux preloaded and must apologize :<br>

http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9133813
</p> 
<p>Well, it was not Asus fault, of course. The fault lies on Vista, a much, 
too much greedy OS. Tiny budget laptops could absolutely not host Vista inside. 
Redmond had not other choice than finally unburry XP, althoug it was oficially 
dead.</p> 
<p>Asus had a great idea : they invented the netbook : tiny, cheap, easy to 
carry. What do you do in a free market when you have a great idea : start 
boosting sales.<br>
 What were they suppose to do from Microsoft point of view 
? Thats easy to guess : wait until Redmond had finally released Win 7 !<br>
 
And certainly NOT launching cheap Linux preloaded things on the end user market.
</p> 
<p>Puting this kind of pressure on manufacturers, signing secret agreements 
with brands like Brother, Tom Tom and many others is not fair buisness 
practices and does not look like Redmond feels confident of his grip on the 
desktop market.</p> 
<p>Redmond behaves itself like a compagny that can mandate what manufacturers 
are allowed to, and what not. They fix limits of what a is a netbook : no more 
than 10,2' screen, no more than 1 Go RAM.</p> 
<p>If a strong guts manufacturer starts saying : STOP, enough with this 
Redmond dictatorship, things will start to change.</p> 
<p>Maybe this contender will be a big brand like Google, Intel, Acer, maybe 
some less known like : Snapdragon.</p> 
<p>Who will benefit from a open market ? : The end user. Of course when there 
is a true competition the consumer can choose between Windows OS, Linux, 
Android, Moblin .......More choice means products will bring us more value for 
money.</p>

<p>I was cheated for several years. I hoped &quot;the new Microsoft OS will

(Win95, Win98, 2000, Xp), more, it was disaster after using MS OS some 
1-1&frac12; years. It was more or less blue screens, restarts, fatal errors,

<p>Windows is not for everyone.</p> 
<p>You see, I have Used Windows from version 1.0 when a mouse could cost 
80-120 US dls. down to Windows Vista Enterprise Edition. Now I am a proud 
tester of Windows 7, so I consider myself a Windows lover, but I have found it 
is just not ready for the desktop.</p> 
<p>The main problem with it is you have to spend real money to put it to work. 
This includes an office suite, anti-virus, photo editing software, real games, 
and so on and on. You could expect to pay somewhere between 200 to 600 US dls 
for them.</p> 
<p>Next problem is Windows won't let you do your work in a continuous fashion, 
no Sir. It will try and install a lot of patches, after which it will prompt 
you to death to restart your machine. Some other programs will do the same. 
Interruptions will be an everyday nuisance. Sometimes you may expect to reboot 
your box up to three times a day. Of course you could disable automatic 
updates, but it is not recommended --as a side note, some people consider 
updates a source of incompatibility problems and even a way to spy on you, but 
it is beyond this post to argument--.</p> 
<p>Then, two or three times a year you'll have to reinstall it from zero, so 
you'd do yourself a favor by keeping safe all CDs that you received with every 
program you bought. It will cost you between 40-50 dls to have it reinstalled 
or you could do it yourself which will take between 4 and 40 hours.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that often you'll have to depend on more than one anti-malware 
product to keep your box relatively safe.</p> 
<p>Besides, you'll have to keep your wallet open, for many of the programs you 
bought will eventually need to be upgraded at a cost. Expect to pay another 
10-50% of the original cost.</p> 
<p>One point of caution. DO NOT EVER, FOR ANY REASON, leave a youngster alone 
in front of a computer running Windows, same as you wouldn't leave a kid inside 
your car if you plan to leave it unattended. You could be exposing her/him to 
porn and other kind of threats, no matter how many protections you have 
installed.</p> 
<p>Other than that Windows is a superb product but as I said before I think 
it's not ready for the desktop, and I wouldn't recommend it at this stage.</p> 
<p>So, what are my options? you may ask. Well, I've been told there's 
something called Linux, which is used worldwide by companies as big as IBM and 
Google, and by lots of individuals as well, and it costs nothing, and comes in 
various flavors --I suppose there may be Entry, Home, Business and Enterprise 
versions--.</p> 
<p>They say some places called LUGS will even install it for you at little or 
no cost, but you see, I am a Windows lover and I can't give you no further 
advise. You'd better google &quot;Linux, Debian, Fedora, Opensuse, Ubuntu&quot; 
(strange names, btw) for the product and flavors, and &quot;The Blog of Helios, 
LUGS, Lindependence, Zareason&quot; to get some advice and assistance.</p>

<p>I've been using Ubuntu since Feisty and it sucks. About 80% of the time I'm 
using my computer, I'm pissed off, since I spend 80% of my time trying to fix 
things and get Linux to work instead of actually using it. Nothing ever fscking 
works right. Ever. I would never recommend it to anyone. It is definitely, 
indisputably not ready for the desktop, and I can't believe how deluded someone 
would be to claim that it is. (Note: This is probably why no one actually uses 
it on the desktop. 1% market share ain't significant.)</p> 
<p>My friends ask me why I use it and I say &quot;I don't know. Someone got me 
to drink the kool-aid and now I'm too invested in it to switch back. Don't try 
it; it's not worth the effort.&quot;</p> 
<p>My family asks me about Windows problems and I try to help them, but then I 
make the mistake of saying &quot;Sorry, I can't help you anymore than I have. I 
don't use Windows anymore.&quot; They ask what I use, and I say &quot;Don't 
ask.&quot; If it's this much of a nightmare for me, a technically-oriented 
engineer, it will be 100x worse for them.</p> 
<p>If Canonical doesn't get their act together, my next computer will probably 
be a Mac.</p> October 30, 2009 1:15 AM <br>
