<h1>Newsflash: Grannies Need Linux</h1> <br>

<p>I completely realize I'm a geek. I've been using Linux far longer than it's 
been the &quot;cool thing&quot; to do. I've also been around the Windows world 
longer than Windows itself. And to nicely round off the playing field, for the 
better part of a decade, I've been supporting a network of Apple computers. All 
this experience means two things:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>I sound much cooler than I really am</li> 
<li>Everybody asks me for help when their computers break</li> </ol> 
<p>The first is really only true in geek circles, but the second is true 
everywhere I go. I don't mind at all, and I love to help people. (I find most 
Open Source enthusiasts tend to have that mindset. It's quite refreshing) Hands 
down, the number one problem people come to me about is spyware. Most of the 
time, that's not the leading question, but it's almost always the root of a 
myriad of issues. Even if you're a pro, spyware is a pain in the butt to clean 
up.</p> 
<p>One of the common suggestions my fellow geeks give people is to buy a Mac. 
The reason is that Macs generally &quot;just work&quot;, and require very 
little maintenance (read: very few calls to friendly grandsons). I'm not 
personally anti-Mac, or even anti-Windows -- so the Apple suggestion is one 
that makes a lot of sense to me. They come pre-installed, have friendly phone 
support, and last a long, long time. But what if Granny already had a Dell that 
your dumb cousin Eddie convinced her to buy? Enter Linux.</p> 
<p>Chances are, Granny's computer hardware is fine. Since Linux will run on 
anything from a toaster oven to a space station -- unless there's actual 
physical damage, the upgrade to Linux should cost nothing but some of your 
time. (And maybe some of Granny's cookies.) Here's a quick list of suggestions 
to make life easier on you both:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Set up automatic login. Logging in is often a tough concept, I don't know 
why.</li> 
<li>Install things like Flash, Java, MP3 support, DVD support, video streaming 
plugins, and true type fonts.</li> 
<li>Put bookmarks on the browser's toolbar. Label them so Granny will 
understand.</li> 
<li>Make the taskbar/panel large</li> 
<li>Install Skype and/or instant messaging software, and preconfigure them so 
Granny can chat with you. You'll both love it. Again, automatic login.</li> 
<li>Configure system updates to run as automatically as possible.</li> 
<li>Standardize Granny's passwords. I know this is insecure, but I think it's 
worth it.</li> 
<li>Make sure Granny calls you with questions, not cousin Eddie.</li> 
<li>Remind Granny not to try buying software from Walmart, or online. Have her 
ask you first.</li> </ol> 
<p>And now it's up to you. Please drop your suggestions for how to set up 
Granny's computer in the comment section below. If we work together, we can 
dominate the elderly desktops of the world in no time. :)</p>

<p>At some point cousin Eddie or one of the many other relatives who know 
granny has a computer are going to generously buy her some wonderful piece of 
software.</p> 
<p>And they're going to be very, very angry at you for 'breaking' her 
perfectly good Windows and replacing it with 'some crap that can't even run 
common programs like Microsoft Office and Photoshop'.</p> 
<p>WINE is not an answer. It doesn't work well enough, or at all, with a hell 
of a lot of the software out there.</p> 
<p>Good luck with that, I haven't found an answer yet. My In-laws still buy 
our kids Windows games every birthday and Christmas. They just do not seem to 
'get' that we do not use windows here.</p>

<p>I do not understand this wholesale phenomenon of Operating System as 
ideological movement. It's an<i>OS</i>. I choose to use Linux but I don't force 
my family to stop being able to use Windows software, and the<i>infinitely</i> 
better selection of games.</p>

<p>All this sounds reasonable to me. Granny wants to email and surf, nothing 
more.</p> <br>

<h3> Grandma Ready Linux </h3> <br>

<p>Here's my post on the topic:</p>

<h3> I've been saying this for years! </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Adam Trickett

<p>I've taken this line for some time. Contrary to popular opinion an older 
user particularly with no Windows experience takes to Linux easier than a 
younger person with Windows (i.e. bad) experience.</p> 
<p>See www.iredale.net/p/by-topic/unix/desktop for my articles and 
presentations on this topic.</p> 
<h3> Linux for grandmas </h3> <br>
 Submitted by lipbalm (not verified) on

<p>My mother-in-law (and grandmother of my kids) has been using Kubuntu on an 
IBM ThinkPad X30 for a couple years now. It's very simplified and locked down. 
Firefox for web (with very obvious bookmarks on the bookmarks bar), ThunderBird 
for mail, and VLC for watching web-based videos of her grandkids. Everything is 
set to auto-login for convenience.</p> 
<p>The killer app (though not-libre) is Picasa for Linux, which installs (and 
self-updates) on Debian/Ubuntu the correct way (via apt). Picasa gives her the 
ability to suck the photos off her digi-cam, correct red-eye, and e-mail 
(appropriately auto-resized) photos to her friends and family. Though not quite 
iPhoto-easy, it works well enough for a somewhat tech phobic granny.</p> 
<p>This has required zero trouble-shooting on my end, except for an occasional 
wi-fi failure (which is always related to DSL flakiness and not the wireless 
network itself). She's also &quot;lost&quot; her KMix applet a few times and so 
couldn't adjust volume until that was restored. Other than those minor blips, 
it's been really painless and quite a testament to the user-friendliness of the 
modern Linux desktop.</p> <br>

<h3> Secure the remote access </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Karl O. Pinc (not 
verified) on Thu, 04/17/2008 - 21:48.<br>

<p>Make yourself an account.</p> 
<p>Disable root ssh logins.</p> 
<p>Disable password ssh logins and use public/private keys to get in with your 
account.</p> 
<p>Now Granny can have bad passwords and she won't get cracked.</p> 
<p>Note that to support Granny remotely one of you is going to need a real 
Internet account, one with a fixed IP. (Speakeasy has worked very well for me, 
YMMV.) Either that or you need some easy button she can press so she can read 
you her IP number off the screen. If you're the one with a fixed IP configure 
Granny's box so that when the interface comes up it brings up an OpenVPN 
connection into your network. Then you'll aways be able to get to Granny.</p> 
<p>Sorry to be mentioning commercial entities in my posts. I am affiliated 
with none of them.</p> 
<h3> The other way to get Granny's external IP </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Sum 
Yung Gai (not verified) on Wed, 04/23/2008 - 14:07. 
<p>Just have Granny surf to www.whatismyip.com and have her read it off the 
screen to you. Boom, you're in.</p>

<h3> You forgot backups </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Karl O. Pinc (not verified) 
on Thu, 04/17/2008 - 21:40.<br>

<p>You forgot backups. Always backup to a remote site. Keep multiple copies. 
The easy way is with some sort of rsync, preferably done from LVM snapshots. 
There's dirvish, rsyncbackup, or whatever. There's rarely reason why the entire 
box should not be backed up, because someday you will need to restore the whole 
thing. Raid is not a substitute for backup.</p> 
<p>If, for some strange reason, you don't have the bandwidth then use an 
outside service like rsync.net. Granny shouldn't be changing her machine much, 
except when upgrades happen, so a lot of bandwidth is not necessary.</p> 
<p>This does mean that Granny needs to leave the machine on, at least 
sometimes.</p> 
<h3> Rsnapshot is a great way to </h3> <br>
 Submitted by paulgear (not 
verified) on Sun, 04/20/2008 - 19:17.<br>

<p>Rsnapshot is a great way to keep backups and include a history over time. 
An external USB drive that holds an rsnapshot archive (with snapshots 
automatically initiated when the system has been idle for a few minutes or if 
more than 2-3 days have passed since the last backup) would be my choice.</p> 
<br> 
<h3> It's not just for grannies </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Anonymous (not 
verified) on Thu, 04/17/2008 - 20:57. 
<p>Great article. Don't forget the accessibility feature.</p> 
<p>BTW, it's not just for grannies. It's for moms and kids too.</p> 
<p>Once I moved all my kids and their mom to linux, with auto-login and nice 
accessible icons and menus (some kids even found beryl-compiz cool), my support 
time has been drastically reduced.</p> 
<p>I had them hooked to firefox, thunderbird, and openoffice in windows before 
moving them to linux.</p> 
<p>Some still require MS Word (dual-boot just for this) because that's what 
the school teaches and gives assignments on, but for most other tasks they use 
openoffice for presentation and spreadsheet just fine. Bibus, gimp, tellico, 
etc. complement their works.</p> 
<p>If they have questions, fire up krfb and share their desktop to see what's 
up.</p> 
<h3> You say they still need MS Word? </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Sum Yung Gai 
(not verified) on Wed, 04/23/2008 - 14:01. 
<p>Hmm...OpenOffice.org Writer handles the MS Word format just fine and has 
for years. Any reason why your kids cannot just use Writer and save in MS's 
format, instead of having to dual-boot like that?</p>

<h3> Granny support </h3> <br>
 Submitted by nightflier (not verified) on Thu,

<p>Good suggestions. Sounds a lot like what I did for my parents. I also made 
it possible for me to remotely access their computer. On the LILO screen I 
created an obviously named entry that boots to runlevel 2 where sshd is loaded. 
Really helps when you are living on different continents.</p> 
<h3> Granddaddies need Linux, too </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Terrell Prude' Jr.

<p>Earlier this year, I set up my Dad, who is now a great-grandfather, with 
CentOS 5. Reason: seven years of bug fixes, and he's a few thousand miles away, 
so regular Ubuntu-ish or Fedora-ish reinstalls aren't an option. Had this been 
mid-to-late 2006, I would've chosen Kubuntu Dapper Drake LTS.</p> 
<p>I did a whole lot of preconfiguring. Had to install all the multimedia 
codecs, *Adobe* Flash (sorry, Gnash just ain't ready yet--I wish!), and the 
kernel video driver to get acceleration and resizing. Also had to do a bunch of 
tweaks to get past the GNOME-isms of Red Hat distros (he runs KDE--it looks 
more &quot;Windows-like&quot;). Before, I had him on Windows NT, so he already 
understood the drill about logging in.</p> 
<p>One other thing helped out a lot. A couple of years ago, I had already 
migrated him from MS Office and Outlook Express over to OpenOffice.org and 
Thunderbird (he *really* likes Thunderbird). Therefore, the only app I had to 
worry about was a Quicken 2003 replacement. KMyMoney turns out to fill the bill 
pretty darned nicely.</p> 
<p>Kai Staats, CEO of Terra Soft Solutions (the Yellow Dog Linux folks), has a 
similar story involving his father. Turned out Mr. Staats needed exceedingly 
little hand-holding.</p>

<h3> My Tips </h3> <br>
 Submitted by TripleII (not verified) on Thu, 
04/17/2008 - 09:49. 
<p>I have OEMed Linux a lot, here are the common links I put on the desktop. 
Literally, the icons are named.</p> 
<p>Write a Letter (Points to OO Writer, Abiword on one low powered machine)<br>
 Internet (links to FF)<br>
 Email (links to thunderbird)<br>
 Pre-Configure 
their Junk folder, show them how to mark things as Junk.<br>
 Listen to Music 
(Points to Amarok)<br>
 GRIP Pre-COnfigured to RIP into the default music 
folder of Amarok, all set up.<br>
 Pre-Configure any MP3 players in Amarok 
before I turn them loose<br>
 Watch a movie (Points to Kaffeine, as you said, 
with ALL codecs installed)<br>
 Get Pictures (points to digiKam, preconfigured 
with default pictures directory)<br>
 Look at Pictures (points to GQiew 
configured to start at top of picture folder, large icons, etc)<br>
 In GQView, 
right click will edit in default Picassa<br>
 I drag the ENTIRE games menu to 
the desktop<br>
 Chat with people (points to Pidgin, autologin)<br>
 I drag KDE 
Control Center to the desktop, leave it as Control Center</p> 
<p>The above are the defaults. A few other items.<br>
 1) Show them where 
downloads from the web are defaulted, change if needed.<br>
 2) Remove the 
delete (if present) and leave the &quot;move to trash&quot;. Everyone 
understands the trash can concept.<br>
 3) I demonstrate how to find and 
install software (if savvy, otherwise, I tell them to call me).<br>
 4) Enable 
Mouse Over Previews of everything, including MP3s.<br>
 5) Pre-Configure ANY 
hardware they use, if required, as SANE to the desktop, etc.<br>
 6) Change KDE 
so that unmounted CD/DVDs icons remain on desktop, make sure that all removable 
drives/devices show up on desktop when mounted (automount). For some reason, 
even when no CD/DVD there, having the icon is re-assuring.</p> 
<p>After the above, 10-20 minutes watching and helping them, they are on their 
way, very litle support needed.</p>

<p>I was looking for a checklist of everything Linux does not include when you 
first install it, and here it is. Kudos!</p> 
<h3> Depends on the Distro </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Anonymous J (not verified) 
on Thu, 04/17/2008 - 09:29. 
<p>Some distros, like Linux Mint I believe, come with a lot of these things 
available out of the box as it were. I don't know about PCLinuxOS but I think 
they lean towards this philosophy as well.</p> 
<p>(disclaimer: I haven't installed either of those distros because I actually 
prefer to install that stuff myself)</p> 
<p>Good list regardless though!</p> <br>
