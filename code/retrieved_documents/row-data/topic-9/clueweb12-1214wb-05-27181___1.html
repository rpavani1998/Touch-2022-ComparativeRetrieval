<p>Is Linux more Secure Than Windows? </p> 
<p>This topic is a preemptive haven for people whose immediate reaction when 
asked how to build a reliable Windows server is &quot;Use Linux.&quot; Thank 
you dear. Tell me why here, and use the other topic for talking about what I 
asked about.</p> 
<p> Joel Spolsky <br>
 Friday, November 07, 2003 </p> 
<p>OS-religion issues aside, as someone who worked as a sysadmin for close to 
10 years, and works with both Linux and Windows servers on a daily basis, I 
would say that neither is more secure than the other, &quot;out of the 
box&quot;. No system is secure when first installed. That being said, Linux is 
more capable of being secured - it's configuration is less opaque and kernel 
and user space are better segmented from each other. The fact that it comes 
from a unix design heritage (as opposed to the desktop single-user model that 
Windows has evolved from) leads to much better system administration tools and 
practices.<br>
<br>
 Computer security is really the act of progressively 
raising the bar to protect the system from compromise. No system can be 
provabily secure. Under Linux, I can raise the bar higher, making compromise 
much more difficult, in less time, with less effort, and less cost than under 
Windows. I can say that Linux is demonstratibly more stable a platform than 
Windows, and I say this with far, far more Windows admin experience than Linux 
experience.<br>
<br>
 Windows is a very, very complex platform to administer - 
the simple interface masks a great deal of complexity, and creates the illusion 
of ease of use. Many solutions to system problems don't lend themselves to 
logical deduction - they are single solution problems that are solved by 
following Microsoft kb articles. Complexity is the number one opponent to 
security. With Linux, you can strip the system down, so that it does one thing 
and one thing only. Under Windows, this is very difficult, if not impossible to 
do. For this reason alone, Linux is much more securable than Windows.</p>

<p>I think you missed the point. My post was to state that in my opinion, 
Linux is more &quot;securable&quot; (that is: better able to be secured) then 
Windows, not that it is more &quot;secure&quot; I base my opinion on my own 
professional experience of administering significant numbers of systems of both 
OSes. Each type of system has it's place - use the one most appropriate for the 
particular problem you are facing. Base your decisions on the facts at hand, 
rather than OS religion.<br>
<br>
 In Joel's case, if he has to personally 
admin the system, then Windows is almost always the correct choice, simply 
because of his level of expertise with the platform. Admin experience is a 
significant factor in determining the appropriate platform to run the task at 
hand.<br>
<br>
 On the other hand, perhaps I was trolled by a Disciple of Bill. 
Not all zealots read Slashdot or use Linux. :-)</p>

done before (if so it hasn't been detected)<br>

has ever been done to Windows (you'll never find out)</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer Linux, but I think that any admin worth their salt 
will tell you the same thing about security: you have to keep up with patches 
or your system will be compromised.&nbsp; The question is: how do you make that 
maintenance cost low?<br>
<br>
 Joel: if you want to administer a Linux server 
without having to mess around with the usual garbage associated with 
re-compiling and re-installing system services, might I recommend
http://www.debian.org/ ?&nbsp; Debian's update system is automatic, free, 
reliable, fast, and (if you use the &quot;stable&quot; distribution) designed 
*specifically* for administrators who don't want to spend a lot of time messing 
around with running systems.<br>
<br>
 The caveat is that the system can be 
quite difficult to install initially, especially if you have esoteric 
hardware.&nbsp; However, beyond the initial installation, *no* upgrade (barring 
the use of new kernel features) should require re-installation or 
downtime.&nbsp; I have been using the same installed image continuously for 
almost 5 years now, and I've twice duplicated the system by copying the drive 
onto another machine and tweaking a few system settings, then upgrading or 
installing new packages.<br>
<br>
 In fact, you can totally automate the 
installation of security patches.&nbsp; Debian comes by default configured to 
install security updates, so if you tell a &quot;stable&quot; machine to 
&quot;apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade&quot; on a nightly basis, it 
will get any new security updates and install them while you sleep.&nbsp; 
(Understandably, you may want to be present to observe this process.&nbsp; In 
practice, however, I have never seen a security update fail.)</p>

<p>Cool, a Joel-Troll! Now I've seen everything!<br>
<br>
 When answering the 
question &quot;(why) is Linux more secure than Windows?&quot; you will have to 
define what Windows is, and what Linux is.<br>
<br>
 These systems are in a 
constant flow of change and highly configurable, and it only takes 1 
&quot;insecurity&quot; to make the system as a whole vulnerable, so when you 
finally finish defining what you mean by &quot;Windows&quot; and by 
&quot;Linux&quot; and ask the &quot;why..?&quot;, you will get answers that 
will include new vulnerabilities and new patches that emerged after your 
definition was completed.<br>
<br>
 So the short answer to &quot;(why) is Linux 
more secure than Linux&quot; is:<br>
 Don't ask! Nobody will actually tell you 
why, but you will still get a million answers, and the most usable answer will 
probably be: Don't ask!</p>

<p>Probably depends on the software you are trying to deploy.<br>
 If the 
software is backed by simple 90s stack (webserver&lt;-&gt;major 
language&lt;-&gt;database&lt;-&gt;os) then I suppose going with you are 
competent with.<br>
<br>
 If it takes you N hours to figure out how to get Perl 
to filter out malicious sql text out of dynamically created insert strings. But 
it takes you 15 minutes to figure the same thing out in VB.Net.. it's no 
competition. Why N hours? It probably takes the same 15 minutes to translate 
the regex, but can you determine for sure the behavior of your Perl's regex in 
the face of other (like ones that forces your regex engine to hang itself 
parsing forever) attacks? Which regex engines do you know best? Maybe you 
happen to know vbscript's regexp engine inside and out and happen to know how 
to work around the issues better than you know Perl's. It works the same the 
other way around.<br>
<br>
 Know BCP and DMO is blazing fast for exports? How 
do you do that with Postgres? Love Apache's mod_rewrite? How do you do that 
properly with asp.net and IIS6? An admirer of OpenBSD's security audits but 
uses windows? Can you find someone to make time to read a good book on ISA 
Server/Checkpoint and a good book on Windows Internals? Are you ready to dig 
into registry and reorder TDI drivers?<br>
<br>
 So in my opinion, It really 
depends on where your competence rest. And what problem you are trying to 
solve. You mix that with the project limitations and you should get something 
figured out.<br>

<p>Look, userland and kernel are different. If everybody was to count the 
number of problems on anything that ran windows, that would be different. 
Remember, linux is just a kernel, most problems they are counting are in the 
userland, should I count one for windows if I make a c program that uses strcpy 
for input and I can overflow the stack?<br>

 Anyway, anybody can quote 
numbers until the cows come home. Use whatever you are happy with.m</p>

<p>&quot;No system is secure when first installed.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Secue as in 
100% secure is an unobtainable dream, but some default installs are more secure 
than others. For that very reason I've chosen OpenBSD to power my server. That 
the install isa breeze and comes with almost everything I need AND nothing more 
than that (no, not 1005 pointless image viewers, not 567 text editors, not 382 
window managers, and not 47 implementations of ping) is a huge plus as far as 
I'm concerned. Less is truely more in my case.<br>
<br>
 essentially, if you 
need a server and aren't going to limit yourself to MS-only products - do 
yourself a favour and have a look at the BSDs and not only Linux.</p>

<p>Just a note about Debian security updates:<br>
<br>
 Glyph, you say you can 
totally automate security updates. Somehow it's true, BUT I don't think it's a 
very wise thing to do. Sometimes you have to restart some service linking to an 
updated library, or you have to check something. Anyone using Debian security 
updates should read the DSAs (Debian Security Advisories) before upgrading, for 
at least two reasons:<br>
<br>
 1) You could find valuable information about 
the upgrade, as things to do before/after it. I admit that most of the times 
you have to do nothing, but anyway...<br>
<br>
 2) Reading security advisories 
makes you learn about your system. And that is good (at least, from a security 
point of view).<br>
<br>
 A random Debian Developer, </p> 
<p> Esteban Manchado Vel&aacute;zquez <br>
 Friday, November 07, 2003 </p> 
<p>I would also suggest Debian (or any other Linux distribution with frequent 
security updates) if you wanted a (Linux) system that is easy to keep update. 
With Debian, the announced security holes are fixed typically in a few (usually 
1) day after the patch is available. The patches for the programs are also 
published very quickly (say usually in 24 hours after the discovery of teh bug) 
by the developers. This means that on the avarage you'll have a patch in 2-4 
days after a bug has been announced.<br>
<br>
 Now copmare that with windows: 
2-3 SP/year? The installation is also quite easy with Debian - two commands 
issued on the command line. Now compare that with windows: you download the 
patch for a certain application for the website of the vendor(*) using a 
browser, then you click on the icon, then a GUI starts, then you click 
'Next&gt;&gt;' a few times, and in the end you most probably have to restart 
(or not).<br>
<br>
 (*): Let's don't forget, that when we refer to Linux, we 
usually mean a distribution, which contains all the software you need to run a 
server (if you are luck enough - Debian has more that 9000 software packages). 
At the same time, you have to acquire the needed applcations separately for 
windows, which means that probably you also have to look for the patches at 
different websites.</p>

 Friday, November 07, 2003 </p> 
<p>Oh, and one more thing - I don't want to convince you about using Debian, 
or linux, where I was trying to get at is that you might have had a hard time 
with linux, because you didn't use the right tool/distribution and yopu 
shouldn't judge based on those experiences.</p> 
<p> Laszlo Marai <br>
 Friday, November 07, 2003 </p> 
<p>Laszlo, I'd recommend you not speak of that which you don't understand.<br>

<br> Windows hotfixes come out every few weeks. Security hotfixes are generally 
available within a week of the announcement of the vulnerability, and 
*obtaining* and installing a hotfix for Windows is five mouse clicks (I just 
counted - did an update while typing).<br>
<br>
 As for automatic update 
services, I'd have to seriously question a sysadmin who allowed automatic 
updates on their server.<br>

<p>I've just been updating the laptop, as holiday time is coming up again.<br>

<br> I went to Office updates. To download the MSDE security patch I first of 
all have to go from Windows update to Office update, then install everything 
else, reboot, and then go to Windows Update and Office update as well. I then 
get click a couple of times, and click on a button called install. After half 
an hour I check to find that the button called install has taken me to a page 
which tells me I'm on the wrong MS site and has a link to another SQL page. 
There are various links on that page and I click on the likely one. A few 
minutes later I check progress to see that the link has sent me to an error 
message. I go back, down the page, and start to install the full SQL .exe. I 
then go back, and read more carefully; for the fun of it I click on the link I 
got the error message on before and this time it takes me to the right page. I 
abort the other installation and click on the other link which then starts the 
11MB download, which it appears doesn't actually check if you have anything 
that needs patching until you have downloaded the same patch.<br>
<br>
 Yep, 
just like you Philo, I install MS security patches while typing. This no doubt 
explains why both of us have hundreds more posts than most other frequent 
posters :)</p>

<p>Security is a topic where there are no saints. <br>
<br>
 Look at the 
OpenSSH exploits for example: this is open source, and a lot of the developers 
and architects are crypto-weenies, and *still* we have new exploits, and 
&quot;do not use *any* version older than....&quot; warnings.<br>
<br>
 So, my 
claim here is more in the nature of an anti-claim: we cannot establish who's 
the &quot;most secure&quot; by using a has-no-security bugs criteria. We also 
cannot establish it by using the severity of bugs.</p> 
<p> Portabella <br>
 Friday, November 07, 2003 </p> 
<p>&quot;Now copmare that with windows: 2-3 SP/year?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Obviously 
not a Windows admin.&nbsp; Wednesday is patch day at Microsoft, and there are 
new &quot;critical&quot; security patches to apply every week, along with many 
others.<br>
<br>
 If you are maintaining more than one or two computers, this 
gets old very fast, especially since every patch needs to be researched and 
tested to make sure it doesn't break mission-critical software x.&nbsp; 
Realistically, once a week is about as much as anyone can keep up with.<br>
<br>
 Being vulnerable for a week is not the end of the world - and applying a patch 
that's going to break things is much worse.&nbsp; Historically, most attacks 
come months after the original patch is released, so if you can keep up to the 
patch schedule your risk is low enough.<br>
<br>
 The real question is not how 
many SPs and/or patches are released per year, but how many vulnerabilities are 
discovered per year.</p>

<p>Dell has no interest in taking sides in the OS wars. In fact, they are 
probably more tied to MS than any other OEM. They're very faithful--they have 
rarely dealt with a non-MS OS (partially because, unlike HP, Compaq, and IBM, 
they don't have their own in-house OS) and they have not jumped onto the Linux 
bandwagon nearly as loudly as others. They're also very monogomous; note that 
they're the only major OEM that has *never* shipped an AMD system. (Up until 
last time I checked; don't know if they're doing or will do any Opteron stuff.) 
They aren't interested in making a point about OS superiority, they just want 
to make as much as they can from whatever product they sell. So why do you 
suppose they charge $149 to host a site on Windows and only $129 for a similar 
site on Linux?<br>

http://www.dellhost.com/dhproduct/overview.aspx?segment=dedicated&amp;category=web&amp;sku=d2800
<br> Why would they offer yet another platform to maintain at a *lower* cost? 
Can't be feaures--the Linux site comes with MySQL and the MS one doesn't have 
any database at all, not even Access.** Hmm... *scratches head*<br>
<br>
 ** 
and don't go on about MS-SQL vs. MySQL; I think we can all agree that any 
database (even the lowly MySQL, which powers Slashdot's ~2 million hits/day) is 
better than no database at all.</p>

<p>&gt;we cannot establish who's the &quot;most secure&quot; by using a 
has-no-security bugs criteria. We also cannot establish it by using the 
severity of bugs.<br>
<br>
 Really? We can't agree that there's a difference 
between the script-kiddie-launched, self-replicating, network-overflowing MS 
mail/web/sql virus du jour and an obscure SSH flaw that has to be manually 
exploited on a per-machine basis?<br>
<br>
 Eh, no reason to, I guess. Bill 
Gates thinks security is not an OS's responsibility; instead, users (who don't 
know the difference between a real error message and a web page designed to 
look like one) should set up and properly configure firewalls, as well as 
regularly install multi-MB patches over a dialup line.<br>

 Of 
course, he forgets to mention that sometimes one patch breaks another, thus 
adding another layer of difficulty to the question of whom do you trust and 
when...<br>

same mistake twice. Oh, wait...<br>

<p>My experience is that Linux is more securable than windows.<br>
<br>
 1. 
Buy &quot;Real World Linux Security&quot;.&nbsp; The only reference you need to 
lock Linux up tight.&nbsp; Unfortunately most distros (I'm certain of RH 7 thru 
8) deliver X with tcp port 6000 open.&nbsp; Although there may be no known 
holes in XFree at the moment, X is too huge (and I consider myself rather 
knowledgeable about X's low level and internals) to be certain that leaving the 
tcp port open is a good idea.&nbsp; Its not, and should be disabled - 
especially when you're on the road, connecting to non-firewall protected 
networks.<br>
<br>
 2. The heart of Unix security and Win32 security exists in 
the fact that kernel space can only be accessed by root or administrator 
authorization.&nbsp; Unix, out of the box, provides a well defined multiuser 
environment which provides a well defined context with respect to who can 
install device drivers, who can change permissions, and who has access to 
what.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The FUNDAMENTAL problem with Windows security is that 
users are accustomed to running administrator privs 100% of the time.&nbsp; 
This is a &quot;usability enhancement&quot; which allows users to install 
any/all programs without performnig the pesky task of swithing from &quot;my 
account&quot; to admin, over and over, when you want to install software.<br>

<br> Additionally, installing any software, not just user mode software becomes 
a priv'd task in Windows.&nbsp; Correct me if I'm wrong (for I'm no Win32 
expert), but would not a user mode application install have full access to the 
registry, able to wipe it clean if the app were malicious or poorly 
designed?&nbsp; Why RealPlayer and Quicktime can &quot;steal&quot; the file 
associations at will?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The Unix analogy is the /etc/ directory 
(much maligned by Windows devs/users).&nbsp; However, in Unix, /etc/ is fully 
protected from access by non-root access (which is all users 99% of the time - 
it takes a deliberate move to make yourself root).&nbsp; So no matter how 
malicous or poorly designed the program, if the OS integrity is intact, then no 
user mode application can corrupt /etc/.&nbsp; System setting remain 
consistent, and can only be changed by root.<br>
<br>
 3. There appears only 
one place for programs to be installed in Windows: the &quot;/Program 
Files&quot; directory.&nbsp; &nbsp; Out of the box, windows XP gives you only 2 
options:&nbsp; the user is admin (can do everything, all the time), or the user 
is a moron (cannont install anything at any time).&nbsp; There is no 
differentiation between a user installing a pure user mode application and a 
device driver&nbsp; No matter how malicious the intent of a user mode app, if 
the OS is secure and intact, the user mode app can only affect the user that 
installed the program and the file which he has access to.&nbsp; Not so when 
you are admin, you can easily and unknowingly destory the entire system.&nbsp; 
While Win32 maintains a very robust kernel and chacl capability, the security 
is almost universally overridden by the default installation of assining all 
users as admin.&nbsp; And this because the usability of windows has not 
followed the same clean design as the kernel was given.<br>
<br>
 4. On a 
corporate network, Windows is hardly remotely adminstratable.&nbsp; That is, 
for an admin to maintain blocks of machines, all amdin tasks must be made 
through GUI manipulation.&nbsp; While theoretically possible, it is practically 
not feasible, to remotely admin windows boxes. You know the windows admin, 
because he carries CD's and floppies around from desk to desk, installing or 
upgrading software.&nbsp; The Unix admin maintains cron jobs on his users' 
computers which poll for updates and install when necessary.&nbsp; A practice 
which has been useful and honed over decades of use.&nbsp; Yes, windows can be 
maintained by remote GUI desktops - but again, it goes one at a time.<br>
<br>
 
Of all these, the fundamental problem of Windows security is that all users run 
as admin all of the time.&nbsp; That is the worst and most exploited of all 
Windows security sins.</p>

<p>Actual counts of security issues and the severity of each issue is my 
empricial basis for stating that one system is more secure than another. I 
believe this is the only rationale that will convince you that system ____ is 
more secure than Windows.<br>
<br>
 How many security updates have you had to 
install on your Windows servers vs. how many updates do you have to install on 
other OSes?<br>
<br>
 The answer is probably the only one that is free of 
religious arguments and personal preferences.<br>
<br>
 Our experience is this: 
we have two server plaforms in our company that are similar to your situation; 
SQLServer on Windows 2000 Server and MySQL on Mac OS X Server.<br>
<br>
 Our 
findings based on my fundamental premise: MySQL on Mac OS X Server is more 
secure than SQLServer on Windows 2000 Server.<br>
<br>
 We also use MySQL 
replication and it works very well.<br>
<br>
 (An aside: this reflects our 
usage of FogBugz. We host the database on MySQL on Mac OS X, while we host the 
frontend on Windows. We delayed our FogBugz purchase for at least 6 months, 
because of the reliance of Windows/IIS as the host for FogBugz. This was based 
on the security issues and problems we had with another application that was 
(and sadly is) completely tied to Windows Server/IIS and SQLServer.)</p>

Note: not all ports are open, only the ones which were opted for

netbios port was intentionally turned on (samba to allow for SMB sharing),but 
should also be turned off when running in the open.&nbsp; SSH is the only 
exposed port which should be allowed open when running outside a firewall.<br>

<br> Other services can be enabled, FTP server, HTTP server, etc.&nbsp; But the

<p>To preface my comment, I should say that I don't really have much technical 
knowledge of security issues in Linux and Windows.&nbsp; I do my desktop 
computing on Windows boxes.<br>
<br>
 It seems to me that at least part of the 
question over which OS is more secure is unrelated to how secure or securable 
each OS is.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 There are many more Windows systems out there than 
there are Linux systems.<br>
<br>
 It seems to be the case that more hackers 
write viruses/worms/etc. to attack Windows systems than to attack Linux 
systems.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 I don't know whether this is because there are many 
more Windows systems (and so more havoc for the hacker to wreak) or because the 
Windows systems are made by Microsoft (and more hackers are MS haters).&nbsp; 
In the end, though, I don't even think the reason matters.<br>
<br>
 Even if 
Windows is slightly more secure or securable (on a technical level) than Linux, 
the number of hackers writing exploits of Windows security weaknesses makes me 
think I'd be more secure on Linux.&nbsp; Hackers devote more resources to 
hacing Windows.&nbsp; I'd rather be on a different system (even if slightly 
less secure) where there isn't as much efforts being devoted to hacking my 
system.<br>
<br>
 If Linux is as secure/securable or more secure/securable than 
Windows, that simply tilts the decision even more in favor of Linux.<br>
<br>
 
And yes, I do realize that there are plenty of hackers trying to exploit Linux, 
too.&nbsp; But I very much doubt that their efforts amount to even a small 
fraction of the efforts being devoted to hacking Windows.</p>

<p>&gt; We can't agree that there's a difference between the 
script-kiddie-launched, self-replicating, network-overflowing MS mail/web/sql 
virus du jour and an obscure SSH flaw that has to be manually exploited on a 
per-machine basis?<br>
<br>
 I didn't mean that there were no differences at 
all, security-wise... and I agree with a previous poster that a security bug 
*count* is probably the best way of establishing the differences. Since 
security is a hot topic, though, there will be all kinds of political arguments 
over the proper way to count :)<br>
<br>
 I do think your example is a bit 
specious. What's stopping someone from automating the SSH flaw and distributing 
it to script kiddies? If the difference is only &quot;that someone hasn't done 
that yet&quot;, then the claim of better security is on pretty shaky ground.</p>

<p>I think you should divide the question into three:<br>
 1. What do I need 
for a dev machine on the intranet ?<br>
 2. What should I use for an intranet 
server?<br>
 3. What should I use for an internet server ?<br>
<br>
 And the 
answers are:<br>
 1. whichever OS you like, but update it centrally from time 
to time and *don't* let anyone from within your intranet computers use internet 
access (this is not a joke, look at what happened to valve. you can, however, 
use linux user mode from within such a machine:
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/uml.xml )<br>
<br>
 2. This is a tough call, using 
windows server in an intranet is pretty nice and fluent as long as you don't 
try the wacky stuff (workgroup + domains + IIS + apache + MS directory + other 
file sharing techniques), installing linux requires knowledge but read point 3 
and you'll see linux is your only option anyway...<br>
<br>
 3. As far as I can 
tell using linux should be the best option for an internet server. I mean a 
server which supports a decent web server (apache), a nice DB (oracle, mysql 
etc.) , perl etc. and has a firewall. Bill gates latest &quot;we don't supply 
firewalls, for that you will need to buy a firewall software&quot; remark is 
bad, it is bad because it shows the utter lack of understanding of the nature 
of a hack. first and foremost - kernels are hacked, not higher layers of 
software. if the kernel is secure (see &quot;good netfilter/iptables 
config&quot; pseudo entry in any FAQ) the OS is secure as well. True, from time 
to time a &quot;cultural hack&quot; is found, like the I love you letter but 
most of the time the high level hacks, the ones which do actual damage are 
kernel level hacks (offcourse you can always argue that by not securing the 
kernel this becomes a user land problem but that would require all different 
apps to try and stop the same malicious source, which is stupid). So, linux (or 
other open source maintained distributions like OpenBSD) is the way to go, it 
has plenty of virtues (open source, good community, fast response, good track 
record, don't undermine the user).<br>
<br>
 But then again, remmember that 
using linux requires LOTS of hours learning, tweaking and understanding what 
you are doing while with windows its all point and click (you can never know 
what this point and clicks end you up with, but thats good old MS)</p>

<p>Security is a PROCESS, not a PRODUCT.<br>
<br>
 Any system is only as 
secure as the admin.<br>
<br>
 There is nothing in Linux that makes it 
inherently better (or inherently worse) than Windows.<br>
<br>
 I think the 
only OS that can be called &quot;inherently more secure&quot; is OpenBSD, and 
it accomplishes that by sacrificing a lot of functionality, which diminishes 
the surface of attack.</p>

<br>
 &quot;The heart of Unix security and Win32 security exists 
in the fact that kernel space can only be accessed by root or administrator 
authorization.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Gotta call bullshit here.&nbsp; A user-mode 
process under Windows can't touch kernel memory, even if it is running as 
Administrator.&nbsp; Using the SYSTEM accounts, it's possible.&nbsp; But you 
can't log in as SYSTEM.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Correct me if I'm wrong (for I'm no 
Win32 expert), but would not a user mode application install have full access 
to the registry&quot;<br>
<br>
 The registry has security controls on it, just 
like the filesystem.&nbsp; Regular users can not arbitrarily write to random 
parts of the registry.<br>
<br>
 Now, to install an application that has 
sytem-wide effects, you do have to run it as administrator (no different than 
Linux).&nbsp; And you don't even have to log out to do it.&nbsp; You can simply 
use RunAs, which works like sudo does under Linux.<br>
<br>
 &quot;the 
fundamental problem of Windows security is that all users run as admin all of 
the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
 No, they don't.&nbsp; Not in any kind of corporate 
environment, anyway.&nbsp; Active Directly has a very powerful approach to 
security, which is considerably more granular than the simple UGO setup that 
*nixes offer.<br>
<br>
 In a home environment, most user's run as 
administrator, and rightly so.&nbsp; It's their computer, and they can do 
whatever they want.<br>
<br>
 On a Linux system, you shouldn't be logged in as 
root 24/7 because one typo can bring a system crashing to a halt.&nbsp; 
However, Windows Administrator is NOT the same as Linux root.<br>
<br>
 Now one 
suggestion that's been made over and over again is &quot;Why not keep user 
accounts running as regular users, and have it ask for the admin password when 
they want to do something like install software?&quot;.&nbsp; OSX does 
something similar.<br>
<br>
 The problem with this approach is that it gets 
users comfortable with the idea of entering their Administrator password 
whenever something asks for it.&nbsp; It's only a matter of time beofre someone 
makes an application that looks just like the &quot;Enter Admin Password&quot; 
dialog, and then you'd have a whole new class of security breaches.<br>
<br>
 
&quot;There appears only one place for programs to be installed in Windows: the 
&quot;/Program Files&quot; directory.&nbsp; &quot;<br>
<br>
 Not true.&nbsp; 
Applications can be installed anywhere.&nbsp; It's just very convenient to keep 
them all in one place.&nbsp; It's no differen than the /bin and /usr/bin 
directories in Unix.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 &quot;On a corporate network, Windows is 
hardly remotely adminstratable.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Again, wrong.&nbsp; There are 
tools like SMS and SUS for remote administration.&nbsp; You can use GPO's to 
manage the registry of client machines (inlcuding grabbing updates from a 
network).&nbsp; If you want something more sophisticated, there are tools like 
Altiris.<br>
<br>
 Also, Windows is fully scriptable, just like Unix.&nbsp; The 
Windows Scripting Host is a very powerful tool.&nbsp; Coupled with the Task 
Scheduler (equivalent of cron), you have all the same automation tools 
available to a Unix admin.</p>

<p>I don't think that 'more secure' is even a question you can answer.&nbsp; I 
use linux,&nbsp; I use it on my two desktops and my router / webserver 
etc.&nbsp; For me,&nbsp; there's no question that it's the most secure option 
available.&nbsp; Windows is not an option.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 *but*&nbsp; This is 
*only* because:<br>
<br>
 1) I've used linux for a long time and am familiar 
with updating and hardening it.<br>
 2) I've not really used windows in a 
'hostile' environment.<br>
<br>
 Web forums aren't really going to answer the 
question, there's the odd whackjob who equates linux and mozilla with the 
apocalypse (see most linux posts here, there's always someone).&nbsp; Then 
there's the other extreme who call all windows users idiots (see everything 
ever written on slashdot).<br>
<br>
 Personally,&nbsp; I think linux is an 
excellent server platform that will continue to eat UNIX's lunch and continue 
to threaten Windows' dominance.&nbsp; But I take a long term view, and I 
realise that it's all a matter of personal preference.<br>
<br>
 Having said 
all that,&nbsp; microsoft's shoddy client software has ruined email, I'm sick 
to death of those damned 400k virus attachments filling up my mailbox.&nbsp; 
That doesn't fill me with confidence in IIS, SQL Server 2k and co.</p>

<p>You're right on most tnings in your last post Myron, but I would take issue 
with you over the virtues of Windows scripting language. There is nothing 
comparable in Windows to the flexibiltiy of the command line in Unix; by 
combining commands you can do pretty well everything, and there are more than 
thirty years of collected commands to play with.</p>

<p>Have you actually used WSH?&nbsp; It's downright amazing.&nbsp; It's not 
just a glorified batch file (ala Unix shells).&nbsp; WSH gives you an amazing 
amount of flexibility.<br>
<br>
 Check out: http://cwashington.netreach.net/ 
and look at the automated stuff that's possible.<br>
<br>
 Before I discovered 
WSH, I though there was no real scripting solution for Windows (without a third 
party).&nbsp; Boy was I wrong.</p> 
<p> Myron A. Semack <br>
 Saturday, November 08, 2003 </p> 
<p>As someone who's used Unix shells extensively, my perspective is that the 
most important thing about the shell is that it's<br>
<br>
 1. standard<br>
 2. 
bullet-proof<br>
<br>
 It's *not* very high-level, but &quot;glorified batch 
file&quot; is manifestly wrong.<br>
<br>
 If the shell isn't sufficient you can 
always use Perl or Python (or other languages) and generally the API 
integration is very good.<br>
<br>
 Interestingly, the Linux developers resist, 
tooth-and-nail, attempts to move to a higher-level language like Python. Wisdom 
or stupidity?<br>
<br>
 I've only dabbled in WSH, but I must ask why Microsoft 
is coming up with *yet another shell* in the Longhorn push. Clearly *they* see 
some inadequacy, real or perceived.</p> 
<p> Portabella <br>
 Saturday, November 08, 2003 </p> 
<p>WSH lets you use VB script or Jscript. Both are great and I've seen whole 
applications written in Jscript, but I think you have little idea about how 
powerful Unix shell commands are.<br>
<br>
 It's not just that there are 
hundreds of pages of them; it's the fact that you can combine them to pretty 
well do anything you want. They represent thirty years of experience doing 
things with Unix systems. VB sript and Jscript were not written with sysadmins 
in mind.</p> 
<p> Stephen Jones <br>

<p>Portabella,<br>
<br>
 UNIX programmers refuse to move to higher level 
languages because of stubbornness.&nbsp; As a UNIX programmer who avoids python 
at all costs myself, I can sympathize.&nbsp; Some of this is because you have a 
lot of very experienced programmers with a massive investment in C.&nbsp; I 
don't have this same massive investment of ten to twenty years, but I have to 
confess that I keep making a heavier investment because I haven't found 
anything that offers me as much capability or flexibility.<br>
<br>
 The 
religious flame war about system security is kind of funny to watch 
though.&nbsp; I've gotta side with the folks that say security depends on the 
quality of the admin.&nbsp; Even my favorite server OS, OpenBSD, can get hacked 
from time to time.&nbsp; Keeping it secure requires keeping the system up to 
date and watching what's going on, just like any other system.</p> 
<p> Clay Dowling <br>
 Saturday, November 08, 2003 </p> 
<p>&quot;Gotta call bullshit here.&nbsp; A user-mode process under Windows 
can't touch kernel memory, even if it is running as Administrator.&nbsp; Using 
the SYSTEM accounts, it's possible.&nbsp; But you can't log in as SYSTEM.&quot;
<br> <br>
 OK, perhaps I simplified ever so slightly.&nbsp; A user running as 
admin can install a device driver, and then access whatever they like through a 
user mode app which accesses the newly installed driver.<br>
<br>
 The bottom 
line is that a user with admin privs can access kernel memory.&nbsp; 
Done.&nbsp; Same in linux, same in windows.<br>
<br>
 Admin privs are 
compromised&nbsp; when users run as admin as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Joel, in regard to your comment about two clicks to securing the Windows 
system: in many Linux distributions (such as Debian or Mandrake), you can 
automatically install updates<br>
 from the command line, (or even from a 
graphical utility).<br>
<br>
 While you still have to wait for the update to 
become available, it is usually shorter than the Windows update becomes 
available. With Windows, you always rely on Microsoft to provide the update, 
while on Linux you have a choice to circumvent the vendor, and install the 
package from the source before it is available from the vendor.</p> 
<p> Shlomi Fish <br>

<p>I'm not quite with you on this Nat.<br>
<br>
 To the best of my knowledge 
you are dealing with a ring system. Kernel mode is ring 0 and user mode is ring 
3.<br>
<br>
 Now some drivers, video drivers, for example, have to access the 
kernel, so I suppose it would be theoretically possible for a virus to install 
a device driver which then accesses the kernel. As all it could probably do 
would to to blue screen the machine I don't see the point. There is much more 
harm it can do in rewriting the registry or the file system or whatever.<br>

<br> Running in user mode, or using the compatibility template if absolutely 
necessary, would stop some viruses from installing, but as has been said, in a 
corporate network everybody is normally running as a user with limited rights.
<br> <br>
 You certainly shouldn't run as Administrator with a DSL or cable 
connection - Ah, if only I could get one how gratefully I would downgrade 
myself to mere user!</p> 
<p> Stephen Jones <br>
 Sunday, November 09, 2003 </p> 
<p>Stephen,<br>
<br>
 Even though a device driver may not access the kernel, 
there is nothing to prevent a driver from accessing the kernel.<br>
<br>
 If I 
am a virus writer, and you are a user without admin privs, the worst I should 
be able to do is infect/delete the files which you have access to.<br>
<br>
 If 
however, you're running as admin, I can install a simple device driver which 
allows me to map any physical page, read/write any device, and delete any 
file.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 As an added bonus, I won't show up in the process list 
when a user hits Ctrl-AltDel for the Taskman.</p> 
<p> nat ersoz <br>
 Sunday, November 09, 2003 </p> 
<p>Not sure it's that clear. You can probably delete any file without touching 
the kernel, since admin normally owns the whole machine.<br>
<br>
 To do this 
in kernel mode you would presumably have to write an alternative I/O driver - a 
bit of a sledgehammer to crack a nut. And there's still the question of Windows 
File Protection.<br>
<br>
 Bear in mind that we are talking about home and SOHO 
machines here; anything in a company will be on a domain and running in user 
mode.<br>
<br>
 If you run as a user all your important files are going to be 
owned by that user, so a program could overwrite them anyway I would have 
thought.</p>

<p>&gt; UNIX programmers refuse to move to higher level languages because of

 That I&nbsp; can believe.....<br>
<br>
 &gt; I 
have to confess that I keep making a heavier investment because I haven't found 
anything that offers me as much capability or flexibility.<br>
<br>
 ... but 
this I can't.<br>
<br>
 Bourne shell lacks both structures and arrays. Stuff I 
can do in 2 seconds in any high-level development language is tedious and 
difficult in shell.<br>
<br>
 I think shell is used with a kind of &quot;less 
is more&quot; attitude.</p>

<p>I think any arguments against the BASH have to be weighted down due to the 
ubiquitous availability of much more robust alternatives such as Perl from the 
Linux command line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Certainly, BASH is a stripped down language 
for automating common tasks, but that is what it was designed for. You can 
hardly fault sed for not allowing access to the networking stack.<br>
<br>
 
BASH is about running small, linkable applications to get specific tasks done. 
Perl is much more intelligent and moving from BASH to Perl has a learning curve 
of less than an hour.&nbsp; And Perl makes any scripting language commonly 
available on Windows appear laughable.</p>

<p>Two things:<br>
<br>
 1. I like Perl. I have made a lot of money with Perl 
over the years. Perl on Unix, in the hands of a guru, is a very powerful tool 
indeed. I have been on (and led) project teams that built enterprise server 
applications in Perl. Even Perl on Windows is pretty much stable these days.<br>
<br> But every time I release Perl code to production, it scares the hell out 
of me (because Perl syntax is so abstruse that it's hard to know what remaining 
bugs may lurk). And although it's nice to be able to use Perl on Windows to 
drive COM objects, I confess that I usually prototype my Automation scripts in 
VBScript, and then port them to Perl once they're working. It's quicker that 
way.<br>
<br>
 2. &quot;Is Linux more secure than Windows?&quot; is a 
nonsensical question. Windows does a lot of things that Linux doesn't try to do 
(ACLs, for example), and if you need those features, there's no contest.<br>

<br> Beyond that, security on either system is obviously only as good as your 
patching habits.</p> 
<p> Jeff Carroll <br>
 Tuesday, November 11, 2003 </p> 
<p>I agree with jeff, admittedly most of my experience is in configuring 
linux(this carefully drings me round to my point):<br>
 I had very little 
difficulty configuring the gateway in my flat to be fairly secure.&nbsp; But 
then i'm *used* to linux, i use linux at uni, and i use it at home.<br>
 On the 
other hand in windows i would merely have had to click share connection and 
enable firewall and i'd have a moderately secure set up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 We 
could argue the neither setup is very secure (i'm not a network guru)... I 
*feel* that my linux setup is more secure than a standard windows setup, but 
the reverse would probably be true of an experienced windows user...<br>
<br>
 
I see most arguments of linux vs windows as being pointless (eg. those 
immediately after blaster, et al) with hoards of linux evangelists using it as 
an example of poor windows security, even though MS had a patch out before the 
incident...&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 We also see people talking about how much the MS 
patches have to fix, but this is merely because a) it can find everything that 
needs to be fixed, all at once, and b) many require reboots, and most people 
would probably not enjoy multiple reboots.&nbsp; Meanwhile in this time there 
have been a dozen updates to a dozen different programs in a generic linux 
system.<br>
<br>
 By default neither system is anymore or less secure, they 
each different approaches to security, which leads them open to different 
problems.<br>
<br>
 Oh, and Windows or more popular, and thus a more 
&quot;profitable&quot; target for any hackers/script kiddies out there.<br>

<p>Come on people, haven't we learned by now that the least &quot;secure&quot; 
OS is the one with the latest hack or virus headline.&nbsp; You can have ports 
off, and kernels patched and users rights allowing them to do nothing but run 
text editors, and still someone will find a way to do something they shouldn't 
be doing.<br>
<br>
 I have to wholeheartedly agree with those posting about 
security being in the hands of the admin.&nbsp; It just doesn't matter what OS 
you've got.&nbsp; If the administrator is on-the-ball, you're OS is as secure 
as it can be...<br>
 ...until the next hack or virus comes out, that is.<br>

<br> Security is an ever moving target, and no operating system is secure if 
the OS hasn't been patched properly, or if passwords aren't protected properly.
<br> <br>
 Which is easiest to patch?&nbsp; Depends on which OS the admin is 
familiar with, doesn't it?&nbsp; If the admin is comfortable with the steps to 
patch the OS then it's easy to maintain.<br>
<br>
 As for what users can access 
in their OS, it again falls in the hands of the admin.&nbsp; Admins can control 
this to very specific rights in just about any OS I'm aware of.</p>

<p>When comparing Linux with Windows as a secure server, you shouldn't use a 
desktop distribution of Linux such as Mandrake or RedHat as the point of 
comparison on the Linux side. (At least, not the default install of them...)<br>
<br> The more secure of Linux and Windows would have to be Linux, hands down - 
if you've chosen an appropriate distribution of Linux, and haven't decided to 
install every single available software package. A base installation of Debian, 
for example, simple won't contain X or the numerous security-hole-prone 
services that are installed by default in Windows and the 
&quot;recommended&quot; installations of some of the desktop distributions of 
Linux.<br>
<br>
 If you want a really secure system, you're probably best off 
selecting either OpenBSD or one of the Linux distributions that are working on 
security above all other considerations.<br>
<br>
 Of course, if you've got 
expertise with Windows and don't know (or want to know) how to do things the 
UNIX way, then you might be better off sticking with Windows. At least until 
they start renting software out instead of selling it...</p>

<p>security issues affect all, at one point more for one than other ..<br>
 
careful configuration and regular update and monitoring helps as seen in 
Openhack challenge.<br>
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,741388,00.asp<br>
 
Surprisingly Microsoft was not compromised once, Oracle and Sun were hit.<br>

<br> The Openhack III was successfully protected by Argus pitbull, even after 
hackers gaining root access. The same concept is now part of Windows 2003 and 
XP Professional under Software permissions policy. Once enabled, just being 
administrator is not sufficient to execute any program. the code needs to 
provide evidence of its source, either particular path, registry key, 
signature, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't know about the real security of Windows vs Linux. <br>
<br>
 What I 
do know is that I do not like to put trust in a single vendor. If you buy 
Windows, whatever version, you put your trust in a huge corporation, with 
internal conflicts and decisions taken for political reasons, or to please 
stockholders, instead of for technical reasons. And yes, I'm working for a 
quite large (high-tech) corporation, smaller than Microsoft.<br>
<br>
 Yes, 
Linux (and some of the other free *NIX dialects) are also developed by big 
groups of people. But there is insight into the process, there is peer-review, 
and you can study the code (as if I would) if you want to. And the development 
of the Linux kernel is not done for profit, nor driven by stockholder 
expectations. And I trust Linus Torvalds, and the people he's chosen.<br>

That is why I'm not running anything under Windows at home. I'm not a Linux 
guru, but using the documentation available, and the wonderful Gentoo&nbsp;
http://www.gentoo.org&nbsp; distribution, I can keep my system (on 24/7, on 
ADSL) up and running and at least fairly secure. I upgrade regularly (using 
only &quot;emerge sync&quot; and &quot;emerge system&quot; or &quot;emerge 
world&quot; every other day, or if there's a patch that needs installing). And 
I'm not paying any Windows taxes while doing so.</p>

<p>&quot;Last time a flaw was discovered in Windows, it took me two clicks to 
patch it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Come on! Even Windows Update patches require more 
than two clicks, and then they usually require a reboot.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Last 
time a flaw was discovered in SSH, it took me four hours of compiling and 
messing around to patch it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Is this a delayed message from 
1996? Most of the mainstream distributions have had automatic updates for 
years. Last time a flaw was discovered in openssh, Red Hat Network carried a 
fix and up2date had it patched within minutes of me ticking the box.<br>
<br>
 
I suppose you might have used a source distribution of openssh, but one would 
have to wonder why if you don't apparently have the confidence (or possibly 
skills) to administer such things.</p>

<p>It does not take four hours of messing around with source to patch an SSH 
vulnerability. Under Debian, a simple apt-get update; apt-get upgrade ssh will 
suffice. Similar solutions exist for other distributions.</p>
