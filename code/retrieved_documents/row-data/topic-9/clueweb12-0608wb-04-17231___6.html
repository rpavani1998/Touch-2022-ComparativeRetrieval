<h3>Windows 7 SMP client</h3> 
<p>by <strong>imnuts</strong> on Fri Jan 09, 2009 5:08 am </p> <br>

<p> </p> Anyone here running Windows 7 with the SMP client? I'm trying to get 
it working but I can't get the necessary files installed (via install.bat) to 
get the core running and I checked over at the folding forum and it doesn't 
appear as though anyone over there is running W7 just yet, though they do have 
a placeholder for comments. <br>

<p> </p> OMG Mark, be easy on them!  It's not a real priority for Stanford to 
put out code for W7 right now, maybe next year eh? Jeez, they just got their 
GPU2 beta cores going very nicely now after a hiccup last November. Hey, try 
SMP in VMWare and see if it works in W7, it would be interesting to know. <br>

<h3>Re: Windows 7 SMP client</h3> 
<p>by <strong>imnuts</strong> on Sat Jan 10, 2009 8:20 pm </p>  I got it 
working. I think the issue was due to a space being in the directory that it 
was installed to. Have it running out of C:\folding and all seems to be working 
well. Maybe since Windows 7 is less resource hungry than Vista I'll have a 
better PPD average now. <br>

Well, you know what's the best OS to run this is right?;) Compile 
your own little kernel in *nix, though *nix SMP has to be the x64 version as 
I'm running in VMWare ATM. Good luck on your PPD, we'll see in a couple of 
days. I'll be installing W7 shortly so we can then compare notes on folding.

I have Gentoo installed on another partition on my 
computer, though GRUB is broken ATM due to installing Windows 7. Unfortunately, 
I don't want to run a 64-bit version of Linux without going full 64-bit, which 
isn't quite possible yet. I do know that my Gentoo install was faster than 
anything else I've used before as it was a very stipped down kernel and since 
everything installed from source, it was all compiled just for my system. 
FreeBSD is the only other thing I'd say compared to the responsiveness of the 
system. <br>

<h3>Re: Windows 7 SMP client</h3> 
<p>by <strong>imnuts</strong> on Wed Jan 21, 2009 4:53 pm </p>  Windows 7 
seems to run slower than Vista for SMP folding performance. Maybe it's just 
because lately I've been doing a little bit more than I did with Vista, but all 
of the WU that I'm getting seem to be taking about 6-8 hrs longer now than they 
did previously. I used to be able to finish them in just under 2 days, now it's 
about 2&frac14;-&frac12; or so. <br>

I had a hard time getting FAHmon to 
display too, but it was my fault as I had it pointing to the wrong directory as 
it is a little bit different for whatever reason in Window 7 <br>
