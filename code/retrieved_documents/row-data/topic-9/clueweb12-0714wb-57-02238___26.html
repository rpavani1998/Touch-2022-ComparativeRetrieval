details about itsnew filesystem called ReFS, which stands for Resilient File 
System. Codenamed 'Protogon,' ReFS will first appear as the storage system for 
Windows Server and later be offered to Windows clients. Microsoft plans to 
deprecate lesser-used NTFS features while maintaining 'a high degree of 
compatibility' for most uses. NTFS has beencriticized in the past for its 
inelegant architecture.&quot;</i>

object IDs, short names, compression, file level encryption (EFS), user data 
transactions, sparse, hard-links, extended attributes and quotas. It is

<p>The &quot;resilience&quot; is from copy on write (CoW), which is used in 
Volume Shadow Copy and Microsoft SQL server. It is also able to cloud data 
across multiple volumes on different machines from what I read. Since both CoW 
and ZFS's copy work a lot like RAID0 (as far as I can tell), I'd expect them to 
be similar in this respect, however ZFS also does checksum tests and NTFS 
doesn't BUT I don't know if ReFS will or not.</p> 
<p>That said, ZFS is a WAY better file system, and I'll give you a few reasons 
why:<br>
No max path length restriction (TFA says there still be one for ReFS)
<br>Variable Block sizes and Sparse Files<br>
Allocate on Flush [wikipedia.org]
<br>Block Journaling (aka Journaling File System) as opposed to Metadata only 
Journaling (NTFS and probably ReFS) which is less reliable<br>
Logical Volume 
Management [wikipedia.org]<br>
and that is just naming a few off the top of my 
head with some links to what they mean if it seemed like it may not be obvious 
(the others are fairly commonly talked about IMO - if you don't know them, they 
should be easy to search for)</p> 
<p> &nbsp; I'm fairly certain NTFS still doesn't support user metadata, 
either, and I believe zfs does (most modern FS's do), so I doubt ReFS will 
(what I mean by this is I can tag a piece of data as, say &quot;photos&quot; 
and then when I search for photos, those are found first - this is a feature 
like what was planned for WinFS's and what Apple's Spotlight does).</p> Parent

<p>That thought crossed my mind, there are legitimate reasons for ditching

the first release in a long time where they weren't under DoJ supervision. 
Also, at this point, NTFS support on other OSes is pretty good. Seems like a 
really convenient way of making it inconvenient to interoperate or multiboot.

provide limited value at the cost of system complexity and footprint,&acirc;

<p>Apple's OSX uses file extension exclusively to determine what sort of file 
it is. They used to use creator codes, but those have been removed and now it 
relies entirely on file extension.</p> 
<p> No, creator and type metadata take precedent over file extension. The big 
change in OSX is that the API and developer tools promote file extensions over 
metadata. There was a big push to ensure that OSX would work correctly even if 
it was using a file system that didn't support metadata.</p> 
<p> Try this, go to the Finder and select &quot;Get Info&quot; on a data file. 
Now go to where it says &quot;Open With&quot; and select a different 
application. Unlike Windows where this selection is forgotten after it opens, 
on OSX the choice is remembered. The Finder sets the creator metadata of the 
data file to ensure that it is always opened with the selected application.</p> 
<p> So metadata is still used in OSX, but extensions now also play a prominent 
role.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

remember. However TechGuys is a known paid shill. At this point I don't even 
know why he bothers. The problem with this new filesystem is that it features 
very poor interoperability with non Microsoft products leaving your data at the 
mercy of Microsoft even worse than before. Now-a-days you can boot up Windows 
computer with a Linux live CD and rescue your files when windows is borked. 
That won't happen now. Microsort is doing everything in their power to break

 I use 
linux (arch linux) on all my machines. I agree with you that this will break 
interoperability, but even I (a die hard linux user) recognize that Microsoft 
has a right to try to improve their file system. NTFS has been around a long 
time (version 1.0 released in 1993). Sometimes laying an old project to rest 
and starting new is the right choice. This does not mean that they are doing 
this to break &quot;system rescue cd&quot; or some other live linux environment.

<p>The real world disagrees with your statement: we have TFS projects with 
long directory and file names, such that we cannot map the entire TFS source in 
a single folder. Even naming it e.g. &quot;c:\x&quot; (or &quot;d:\&quot;, 
putting it on a separate drive), the paths and files<i>still</i> exceed 
MAX_PATH (which is260, [microsoft.com] not 255).</p> 
<p>So, this feature will be useful to our shop.</p> 
<p>It's also useful for &quot;rolling backups&quot;; I administer family 
machines, and one has been upgraded from a desktop, to a laptop, to another 
laptop. The first upgrade, I copied all the files to &quot;c:\e&quot; (old 
machine was an eMachine). That laptop died, we used a restoration company that 
started with a &quot;G&quot; to get the data back (now we backup via WHS), and 
I saved that in &quot;c:\g&quot; (so there's a &quot;c:\g\e&quot; with the 
desktop's files). The third machine (second laptop) has &quot;c:\h&quot; (which 
also contains &quot;c:\h\g\e&quot;). Other times I've saved backups with more 
descriptive names, like &quot;Backup of the Dell Inspiron 5150, 
2011-11-11&quot;, and sometimes those backups fit inside each other like 
expressed above.</p> 
<p>So, I have examples from both home and work where having

<p> How much data did you have on a single large zdev that it required that 
amount of time? I tend to group mine into groups of 8 disks with raidz2. When I 
have to rebuild, it does so at the write speed of the new disk (100+MB/sec). If 
you have a relatively small array and it still takes 45 days to rebuild then 
you have a hardware issue, or you are using an siig card, which has horrible 
performance under all the unix/linux variants I have used.</p> 
<p> I use zfs on linux at home with an 8 disk raidz2 array for network 
storage. On a core 2 duo / 2.5ghz using an lsi 1068 based card, I achieve a 
rebuild speed of 80+MB per second, a scrub speed of 150+MB/sec. At work, I use 
it to store spatial data / 3d video using zfs on linux. Multiple 8 disk raidz2 
devices connected via lsi 9200 card. I achieve a rebuild speed of 80+MB per 
second, a scrub speed of 250+MB/sec.</p> 
<p> If you use junk cards, you get junk performance.</p> Parent Share twitter

<p>A few weeks ago, I pulled &quot;Hail Mary&quot; with regards to saving an 
SBS 2003 server. For whatever reason, the server would not boot after a power 
failure. The RAID cache was not dirty on the card, and the RAID volume passed a 
manual parity consistency check. Unfortunately, the server would still not boot 
into the OS. It kept throwing a BSOD or hung at finding the hal.dll file. 
Attempting to access the recovery console or other F8 invoked options failed. 
Any Server 2003 disk would throw a BSOD the moment it attempted to mount the 
boot &quot;C&quot; volume. It wasn't the RAID drivers, but actual NTFS 
corruption causing the kernel panic. Serious shit. However, a Server 2008 R2 
disk<i>did</i> save my ass. I was able to mount the volume through a command 
recovery console. A chkdsk revealed massive amounts of corruption. Server is 
fucked right? NO! A &quot;chkdsk /R&quot; command was able to find and repair 
all errors. No data loss what-so-ever.</p> 
<p>Basically, the server must have been busy with installing updates or 
something when the power died. An old UPS battery will do that. But this goes 
to show how remarkably resilient the NTFS system is. Absolute respect!</p> Share
