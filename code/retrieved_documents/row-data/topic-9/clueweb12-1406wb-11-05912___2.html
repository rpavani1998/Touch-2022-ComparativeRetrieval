 Linux Today Correspondent</b> </p>
<p>Do Linux security exploits really belong in the same league as Windows 
security holes? Are OpenOffice and its derivatives actually as good as 
Microsoft Office? These are just a couple of the questions debated this week by 
a panel of experts at the CeBIT America show in New York City.</p>
<p>Comparing Linux and Windows security amounts to a &quot;chicken and 
egg&quot; issue, according to Kathy Ivens, an author and consultant.</p>
<p>Given that Linux is a more secure environment, it's tough to know whether 
this is because Linux is &quot;inherently more secure,&quot; or because Windows 
is still the more prevalent environment, Ivens said, during a panel moderated 
by Paul Gillin, VP of Editorial at TechTarget.</p>
<p>Also during the session, Nicholas Petreley, an analyst and consultant at 
Evans Data, contended that regardless of the numbers of exploits per platform, 
Windows exploits are often much more severe. Citing materials produced by 
Microsoft itself, Petreley said that many of the growing population of worms 
targeting Windows let outside hackers &quot;completely take over&quot; a server.
</p>
<p>In contrast, Linux exploits are generally more limited in scope, and more 
likely to lend themselves to insider attacks, Petreley suggested. One Linux 
exploit, for instance, permits information in Firebird servers to be 
overwritten.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, though, Windows is still easier to administer, 
according to several of the panelists. &quot;That's where Linux is behind, 
especially in directory services,&quot; Petreley observed.</p>
<p>Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall, president and executive director of Linux 
International, pointed to third-party tools, available from vendors such as IBM 
and Computer Associates (CA), for managing Linux along with MVS and Unix, for 
example.</p>
<p>&quot;In enterprise environments, that's what (you're) looking for,&quot; 
said Hall. Yet, he admitted, companies need to pay for such tools.</p>
<p>&quot;(Administrative) controls are a lot better (in Windows),&quot; Ivens 
asserted, citing printer set-up as one example.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other panelists pointed to freely available Linux tools such as 
Samba.</p>
<p>What about Linux on the desktop? OpenOffice and its derivatives lack some 
of the features of Microsoft Office, according to Mark Minasi, a writer and 
consultant</p>
<p>Petreley, though, argued that EI (Evermore Integrated) Office, an office 
suite from Evermore Software, contains a similar feature set to Microsoft 
Office. Unlike Microsoft Office, however, EI Office doesn't allow anti-aliasing 
of fonts, he acknowledged, attributing this distinction to a decision by 
authors of the Java-based program to reduce overhead. EI Office runs on both 
Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>OpenOffice types of suites also tend to come with fewer fonts, indicated 
Hall. One rather obvious reason is that some font creators charge for the 
fonts, according to Hall.</p>
<p>On an overall basis, Linux applications still lack the &quot;fit and 
finish&quot; of Windows apps, Minasi charged. To gain more traction on the 
desktop, Linux needs a better GUI, he insisted.</p>
<p>Ivens, however, argued that GUIs aren't necessarily the way to go for all 
applications. In fact, some database and accounting apps have actually taken 
performance hits from the advent of the Windows GUI.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no reason to have a GUI to punch in numbers,&quot; Ivens 
said. She harkened back to the days when the MAS 90 accounting system was at 
its zenith. Back then, MAS 90 was sold in Unix and DOS flavors. &quot;My 
clients loved it,&quot; according to Ivens.</p>
<p>Ivens would also like to see fewer features in today's office suites. 
Microsoft Office, she quipped, seems to be evolving under an illusion in 
Redmond that &quot;everyone in the world is collaborating on a single 
document.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet most users take advantage of only a small fraction of Office features, 
and migration to Microsoft Office 2003 has been particularly slow, Ivens 
observed.</p>
<p>In terms of third-party desktop applications, Linux is now starting to 
catch up with Windows, panelists generally concurred. Quicken, for instance, is 
now available for Linux, said Hall.</p>
<p>Desktop gaming, however, is one area where Linux still lags, according to 
Petreley. Yet with increasing improvements to game consoles such as Game Cube, 
more consumers are migrating from Windows-based PC games to consoles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Windows doesn't necessarily hold much of an edge when it 
comes to ease of installation, according to the CeBIT panelists. Many users 
don't know how tricky Windows can be to install, since Windows still comes 
pre-installed on most PCs, members of the CeBIT audience were told.</p>
<p>Hall said that he'll be more than happy if Linux ultimately captures 30 
percent of the desktop space.</p>
<p>&quot;Competition is good,&quot; he declared. Hall reasoned that, as a 
result, no operating system -- not even Linux -- should totally dominate any 
market.</p>
