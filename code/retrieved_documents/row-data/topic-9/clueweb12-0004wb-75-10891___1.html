<h1>Windows Defectors: Why Linux Is Worth Migrating To, Sometimes</h1> 
<p><b>By James Roberts</b></p> 
<p> </p> 
<blockquote> <em> [James has agreed to coordinate the &quot;Windows 
Defectors&quot; series longrequested in the Mailbag. This series is for those 
new to Linux who come from a Windows background. In spite of the series title, 
it's not just for those who have stopped using Windows completely. People who 
still like Windows, use Windows grudgingly, or deal with Linux-Windows 
integration in LANs will also find the information useful. Unlike LG's other 
series, this one will be written by multiple authors, since there is such an 
interest on writing on this subject. The next article in this issue (by Tom 
Brown) is also a Window Defectors article.</em> 
<p><em> We're considering changing the series title to something less negative 
(e.g., &quot;Linux For Your Mom&quot;, &quot;Leaning Towards Linux&quot;, 
&quot;Windows Immigrants Help Box&quot;, &quot;c:\&gt;, Drive-In for Windows 
Users&quot;, &quot;At Liberty Under the Hood&quot;, &quot;Linux Incognito&quot; 
-- all suggested by Petar Marinov), but we're leaving it as &quot;Windows 
Defectors&quot; initially because that's what it has been known in the Mailbag. 
-Sluggo.]</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>&quot;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.&quot; -George 
Santayana</p> 
<p>Have you heard that quote before? I expect so - and that's part of the 
point of the quote. This is the first article in a series aimed at the many 
people who are interested in Linux, but currently use Windows. It aims to ask, 
and perhaps answer, questions such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Why should anyone defect - or migrate - from Windows to Linux?</li> 
<li>What should be migrated?</li> 
<li>What are the benefits, if any?</li> 
<li>What are the problems?</li> 
<li>Are there work-rounds for the problems?</li> 
<li>Who should consider this option?</li> 
<li>Who should avoid it?</li> </ul> 
<h2>What's the context? </h2> 
<p>All such discussions have a context, and the context I intend here is that 
of the Small and Medium Enterprise, or SME. I'm not addressing the issues for 
the single desktop, or for the large multinational corporation. In fact, for 
both these extremes the issues are arguably simpler: at one end it's just 
personal choice of platform, at the other the resources are available to 
implement customised solutions as needed. But it is the SME area that has in 
the current, somewhat-recessive economic circumstances, consistently been 
identified by the IT industry as the last largely untapped potential growth 
area. I'm referring here to small installations of between two and a hundred 
desktops and servers. This SME area is price-sensitive, hasn't upgraded for 
years, has no IT management: it's where Linux can make a difference, and it's 
where I reckon it's hardest for Linux to enter - for reasons that I will 
describe later. If the problems can be solved here, then Linux will become 
'sticky' at this level of the 'ordinary' user.</p> 
<p>In this first article I'd like to set the scene, and this is why I started 
with the Santayana quote. I've noticed that people with a UNIX background often 
have had little contact with those who have been weaned on DOS - and vice 
versa. The target business that I'd like us to keep in mind is a small office - 
say eight or ten users altogether - and if this small office has a history in 
computing, it will generally have been in DOS and Windows.</p> 
<p>So let's review where this typical office is now, and how it got here. It's 
a long and somewhat sad story, but in the end, you'll maybe see why, once, 
Windows NT was better for our clients than XENIX/SUN, and why now Linux may be 
better than NT.</p> 
<h3>Anti-flame note </h3> 
<p>Before we start, let me state that I am convinced that GNU/Linux is a 
masterly piece of work on the whole, and an astonishing achievement. Since it's 
made by humans however, it's not perfect, and inevitably it's the imperfections 
that I'll have to emphasise. The alternative options are also imperfect, that's 
why we're looking at Linux. But in some areas the alternatives may have 
strengths that GNU/Linux lacks. Please take the comments in the appropriate 
light. I also have to say that all trademarks are acknowledged.</p> 
<h2>Blast from Past </h2> 
<p>I'd like us to think back ten years or so - at which time (by mere 
coincidence) I'd just joined a small UK SME VAR as hardware tech. Within about 
ten days of starting I'd been bumped up into a systems and end-user support 
role as well. The VAR was then primarily a Novell reseller and customiser, and 
I quickly got to know the advantages and disadvantages of Novell 3.1. At that 
time most of the clients were solicitors (lawyers), and their systems typically 
were running a Novell server on a i386 or i486 with SCSI drives, with up to 
twenty-five diskless net-booted i386 workstations, running WordPerfect.</p> 
<p>Overall the server/diskless workstation was a very good fit for the 
clients' needs; it was reliable, fast (the 10 Mbps network was faster than 
contemporary IDE drives) and easy to maintain (all the configuration files were 
in one place).</p> 
<p>It was also abstruse, non-intuitive (indeed, counter-intuitive at times) 
and completely non-user-friendly. Any minor configuration error was often 
fatal. But it did work, and did the job well.</p> 
<h2>Enter the Band-wagon </h2> 
<p>Then Windows for Workgroups came along. We could put a network of 
twenty-five peer-to-peer workstations into a site for much less than we could 
do a Novell installation. Not only that, all the hardware was readily available 
and used standard parts (the diskless workstations needed specific types of PSU 
and weren't easily upgradeable). Moreover, with the Windows system, the clients 
had the illusion of a familiar system - most of the decision-makers who wanted 
to introduce networked systems already had Windows boxes at home. Also the 
clients could install their own extra software packages without invoking our 
aid (and paying for it).</p> 
<p>Pretty soon we were installing a lot more Windows for Workgroups than 
Novell. Of course, it didn't take long for the downside to be apparent - no 
central installation of applications, no central control of rights, no user 
controls whatsoever, big problems with workstation backup, insecure 
peer-to-peer networking. So our recommended system included a Novell server, 
which solved some (but not all) of these problems.</p> 
<p>Then Windows NT came out - and it was cheaper than Novell, both for the 
server and for the client access licences. And for the client, again it gave 
the illusion of familiarity - it looked like Windows. And for me, it came from 
the architect of Digital VMS - it was written by someone who did know what they 
were doing.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Novell had changed their OS completely to version 4, which no 
one I knew found easy to use. They had introduced large-scale management tools, 
which merely muddied the waters for our typical installs of 5 to 10 clients, 
and it cost more than version 3.x.</p> 
<p>Pretty soon we were selling networks made up of Windows for Workgroups 
workstations with a Windows NT 3.51 server, for a much lower overall cost than 
the previous Novell-plus-diskless workstations solution, and with pretty 
reasonable reliability and performance. Of course, building all the 
workstations took time, so I developed a custom cloning system that could build 
ten identical workstations in about fifteen minutes each.</p> 
<h2>Nixing XENIX </h2> 
<p>By then (and we are getting to 1995 or so), we had become pretty well-known 
and had a good reputation for looking after clients, so more than one solicitor 
came to us to replace their 286/386 XENIX-based system, which was by then 
getting pretty long in the tooth (like me now!). I never installed any RS232 
terminals, but I removed a lot. They'd done a good job for their owners, but 
the replacement - with Windows 95 on the desktop and Windows NT 3.51 on the 
server - was like jumping forward a whole epoch, compared with the 9600 baud 
green-screen serial terminals in previous use. Was Windows actually as 
reliable? Well, yes, given the age of the systems being replaced, it was in 
fact more reliable.</p> 
<p>So things went on, and as they went on the problems of this Windows 
computing paradigm - which had always been apparent in contrast to the 
Novell/diskless paradigm - became more and more cogent.</p> 
<p>Windows 95 was effective - it's a masterpiece of forward and backward 
compatibility in my view - but it was not stable. It crashed easily. It was not 
secure. It was big, and the interactions within the systems were unpredictable. 
Add third-party software (and a different mix of such software on every box) 
and problems would arise that no-one reliably could solve. We got used to 
reformatting and reinstalling.</p> 
<p>Windows 98 was better, and more reliable, but much bigger again, for no 
very good reason. It still crashed unpredictably, and took even longer to 
fault-find or reinstall. Windows NT server was pretty darn stable (after a few 
service packs), and so we all looked forward to Windows NT 4 coming in 1996, 
with the back-end stability of NT and the new interface of 98.</p> 
<p>I adopted NT4 workstation as my personal desktop as soon as it was 
released, but I had to dual-boot with 98 because NT4 did not run games well - 
and I like games. However, NT workstation was too expensive to sell into our 
clients in general, so our standard install was Windows 98 on the desktop and 
Windows NT 4 server on the back end, and this worked pretty well.</p> 
<h2>Setting Sun </h2> 
<p>In 1996/7 we sold this system into various sites that were running Sun 
Solaris/SPARC. It was interesting how this came about. Why ever would someone 
using Sun SPARC workstations want Windows? Well, for freedom, odd as this may 
seem given the current context.</p> 
<p>At the particular sites in question, 'the Sun' was under the exclusive 
control of 'The System Administrator' - who would install only what they wanted 
to install, after triplicate written requests, passed back up to company HQ and 
triple signed off by company IT. Maybe. Meanwhile the workers and researchers, 
who just wanted to get things done, were bringing in their own Windows machines 
and running SPSS or MathCAD or some custom sample analysis software on them 
just to get the work done, and meanwhile the new spectrometers in the lab came 
with Windows-based software that had to be copied BY HAND to the UNIX system! 
Yes, Windows and Windows networking at that time actually represented more 
'Freedom' for these people, and eventually the lab Sun systems were retired and 
sold off.</p> 
<p>Do I feel shame? No! I remember two issues. One was concerning a video lead 
for a monitor. The video lead - which if I remember correctly was standard 
apart from the blanking off of one pin - was $150, about, from Sun. I could 
source the same lead (apart from the blanked hole) for $7. And the price of a 
network card? Don't ask. Meanwhile, it took twenty minutes to link the lab pc 
talking to the machinery into the network - something that had been on request 
for a year. Any company that exploits a monopoly in this way develops users who 
detest it. Yes, any company.</p> 
<h2>Back in the future </h2> 
<p>So we get up to 1999 and Windows 2000 Pro. Windows 2000 is as good as 
Windows has got. It was pretty solid, pretty easy to use, fast, adequately 
tuned, and a good desktop system. But Windows 2000 Pro had a deliberately 
broken networking model, presumably to force a contrast with Windows 2000 
server. Windows 2000 Workstation would only handle ten clients; this was 
reminiscent of the Intel tricks with the 486 series. The Outlook mail/groupware 
client was also broken, in that core functionality had been moved to Exchange 
server, and as far as I could see for one reason only: to make clients buy 
Exchange server. I didn't like this. But Windows 2K was still a good bet for 
our clients, although it was getting really overblown in size and slower and 
slower every issue.</p> 
<h2>The Plague years </h2> 
<p>Then the viruses started to really hit.</p> 
<p>Then Windows XP came out.</p> 
<p>We don't sell XP, if we can help it.</p> 
<p>We have a few problems with it. We don't like the licence (it's a potential 
problem for most solicitors/lawyers and anyone else with a duty of 
confidentiality), we don't like the desktop (it's an insult), we don't like the 
vulnerabilities, or the slow performance, or the sheer undocumented mass of it 
all. But that's not the<em>real</em> problem. The <em>real</em> problem we have 
is that soon we won't be able to get Windows 2000 any more.</p> 
<p>There's a problem in another area too. Many of our clients are running 
Windows NT 4 server. It's very solid. It works. It does the job. But there will 
soon be no more security updates or support for this version, and we will have 
to migrate clients to something else. Windows 2000 server, 2000 AS or 
especially Windows Server 2003 are a ridiculous overkill for an office with six 
client machines, as well as being much more expensive and needing huge hardware 
resources to run. So what else can we install to replace NT4?</p> 
<h2>Enter the Penguin </h2> 
<p>Now, back in 1993 I had ran into Slackware, presented as a cover disk with 
Personal Computer World UK. I installed it and played with it, but it didn't do 
anything I needed. Nonetheless, I kept an eye on GNU/Linux and installed most 
builds of Slack, then Red Hat. We bought in a pre-configured GNU/Linux 
Slackware box in about 1996 to run as our mail server, initially on dial-up and 
then ISDN, and over 5 years it never crashed. The PSU failed one day, and I 
managed to migrate the system to a different box and a bigger hard drive and 
get it all working again (I never was sure how). Many people say that Windows 
is unstable. With the NT series and all relevant patches on supported hardware 
- I just don't think that's true. I've had Win NT 4 boxes stay up for years. 
But that GNU/Linux could so easily match or exceed this performance impressed 
me.</p> 
<p>Moreover, GNU/Linux has over the last few years transformed its graphical 
desktop capacity. Not only are there lots of interestingly geeky X-desktops 
available, but two mainstream competitors for Windows 2k/XP, with generally 
enhanced capabilities.</p> 
<p>Two years ago, with the launch of XP and the developments in Samba, I 
decided to seriously evaluate the potential of Linux for replacing Windows NT 4 
on the backend with a GNU/Linux box running Samba. I installed every mainstream 
distro I could get, on every box I could test it on. I played with it, broke 
it, fixed it (sometimes) and did my sums. Then we put some test boxes into 
clients, mostly as mail servers/file servers with AV integrated, and they have 
on the whole been working flawlessly ever since.</p> 
<p>But all is not sweetness and light. There are some problems to overcome in 
retro-fitting GNU/Linux into a Windows network, and now I've given the history 
I've just laid out, I hope you'll see them a little differently.</p> 
<p> Next month I'll start discussing what sorts of problems we've encountered 
and how we've tried to work with them.</p>
