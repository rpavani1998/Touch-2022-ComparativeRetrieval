<h2>  Microsoft Vs Ubuntu (Linux) </h2> 
<blockquote> After years of use, I conclude with any windows operating system, 
it becomes slower over time, I notice that some virus checkers/Firewalls are 
making this even more painful.<br>
 Licencing issues and office/microsoft 
updates are also contributing to this, making using Microsoft, become painful 
and almost pointless for day to day stuff.<br>
<br>
 I have recently switched 
to (free) Ubuntu and am pleasantly surprised, the more I use this and its free 
apps (compatable office and email etc) the less I use MS, I also noted that 
dual booting I can always switch back if needed, I like the way Ubuntu imports 
your settings into its Operating system, and the way you can still view files 
in your Microsoft partition when you use dual boot.<br>
<br>
 I wont be 
switching back unless there are apps that wont run in Ubuntu.</blockquote>

<blockquote> TBH I have just also installed Kubunto, a linux based OS, this 
mainly because of the fact that Google is developing a Linux based OS, and with 
the increasing popularity of Linux, and the growing availability of 
applications, I can see in the near futur Linux becoming a serious contender to 
Windows, especially with the current cost of windows compared to linux.<br>
<br>
 Unfortunately though as I say I have just installed it and basically not 
really spent more than a couple of hours playing with it, so can't really say 
as yet if I think it will replace windows on my system just yet.</blockquote>

<blockquote> I am running 9.10 on my other laptop as the only OS. I like it a 
lot, it seems so much simpler than Windows, and yet there is a lot of strength 
for web browsing, media, and some games here and there. I always remember how 
much I dislike Windows whenever I use it. It feels so cluttered once your used 
to Ubuntu. But yeah, OS X and Windows better watch their backs. Dell even makes 
several non-netbooks that run Ubuntu now.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<p>Operating System:<br>
Debian &amp; Ubuntu</p> 
<h2> </h2> 
<blockquote> Linux is customizable in a way that Windows is not. For one, the 
user interface, while similar in concept, varies in detail from distribution to 
distribution. For example, the task bar may default to being on the top or the 
bottom. Also, there are many special purpose versions of Linux above and beyond 
the full blown distributions.<br>
<br>
 The flavors of Linux are referred to as 
distributions (often shortened to &quot;distros&quot;). All the Linux 
distributions released around the same time frame will use the same kernel (the 
guts of the Operating System). They differ in the add-on software provided, 
GUI, install process, price, documentation and technical support. Both Linux 
and Windows come in desktop and server editions.<br>
<br>
 However most 
developers, hackers, gurus will have both laying around, heck some of them may 
even have a copy of ReactOS which is a complete re-write of the Windows source 
code by a group of enthusiasts who wanted something better than the bloated 
chunky API coded by Redmond.<br>
<br>
 The biggest crutch against Linux is it 
is not easy to get to grips with if your not used to using it, it's possible to 
bork or kill your own machine from installing the wrong package from an on-line 
repository or archive. Making a mistake in windows usually gives you an error 
message, however making a mistake on linux can lead to the dreaded kernel panic 
or worse.<br>
<br>
 The thing in Linux's favor is it runs on both PC &amp; Mac 
whereas PC &amp; Mac software wont run on each other due to constraints put on 
there respective operating systems by there manufacturer. There are Software 
hacks you can do to run those system on not native hardware but why bother when 
Linux presents a far easier solution as it runs on both.<br>
<br>
 Linux used 
to be all shell driven, meaning it used to be all command line, X-Windows or 
X11 only came along later. When Microsoft was dominating the market with 
Windows98SE and NT4 Linux was very much still in its infancy with most people 
oblivious to it's existence. (I think I still have a copy of the old 2.5beta 
Kernel laying around on CD somewhere!) Windows has something akin to 200 or so 
commands that you can learn and pass to the DOS command prompt whereas Linux 
has so many commands and functions you could spend your lifetime reading and 
still find yourself not having covered every subject. <br>
<br>
 To improve 
your overall experience of Linux I advocate trying out all the different types 
of Desktop, there are a fair few to choose from, some offering more speed than 
others, others being maybe a bit slower but more functional in terms of 
graphics and point and click. The best thing anyone new to Linux can do is 
start to familiarize themselves with the Terminal, as that is where - as your 
experience grows you'll find you'll end up spending 99.5% of your time. The 
other .5 will probably be spent surfing on the Internet. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Linux has been the talk of hte town in the recent times and is 
bound to get more and more popular because of its usability, you can model the 
OS to behave the way you want it to. It also provides a better protection than 
the Windows. Linux also help you to enhance the look of your OS graphically and 
OpenOffice doesn't allow you to miss MS Office even for a little while. There 
are even better audio and video players in Linux, thus Linux is a complete 
package of a good OS.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<blockquote> Jimmytazz is right about the community effort that goes into 
improving Linux-based OS'es, rather than the profit that Microsoft and Apple is 
expecting.<br>
 However, Wine isn't able to run &quot;all&quot; windows 
software, as it doesn't support programs written for the old DOS-based windows 
versions. This leaves a lot of old-school games outside, and a lot of other 
games doesn't work at all, or works a bit slow. This will probably improve with 
time, but currently Linux works best with Linux-programs and Windows with 
Windows-programs.</blockquote>
