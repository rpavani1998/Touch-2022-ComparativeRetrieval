<h2>Benefits of Using Linux Dedicated Servers</h2> <br>
Mar 06 2012 <br>
<br>

<p>You might find using a shared server service for hosting your website to be 
affordable, but it will be difficult to continue for long. As the traffic 
starts growing on your website, the speed decreases leading to inconveniences 
of accessing the website for the visitors. It is better to have your own 
dedicated server for your website. You will have your own operating system to 
control and applications which will be helpful to boost your business.</p> 
<p>The most popular choice of dedicated servers is Linux server. Compared to 
other servers, Linux dedicated servers are cost efficient. Operating Linux 
servers is also easy. Most of the businesses opt for<strong>Linux dedicated 
servers </strong>as they are affordable.</p> 
<p>Microsoft is another dedicated server which is equally popular as Linux 
servers in the market. One limitation of Microsoft dedicated server is that, 
for each software package, separate licenses are needed. But this is not 
required in case of Linux dedicated servers and there is no cost involved.</p> 
<p>Linux is a most popular name all over the world. One of the major 
advantages of using Linux dedicated server is the reliability it offers. 
Besides reliability, Linux servers also have the capability of running for 
longer time. Also, most of the operating systems in the market today, are 
easily compatible with Linux servers.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Choosing a Linux Dedicated Server</h2> <br>
Mar 03 2012 <br>

<br> 
<p>A dedicated server host is a costly internet solution. If you have a large 
business which is spread over many locations or if you have a website which has 
multiple database retrievals in a short span of time, dedicated server host 
helps you maintain uninterrupted flow of data when you want to access it. But 
if you are looking for a dedicated server host for Linux platforms, they are 
relatively cheaper. Also, in contrast to windows dedicated server host, Linux 
dedicated servers do not require separate licenses for each tool or software 
released each time. You can obtain a Linux based dedicated server host for a 
large business or a website to maintain it effectively.</p> 
<p>The main advantage of <strong>Linux dedicated server</strong> is that they 
run for a long time with minimal maintenance. They require almost no 
interference. Linux dedicated servers are built for business operations with 
enough tenacity to withstand massive block outs of internet service or huge 
internet traffic. Losing important data on a personal computer and losing data 
on a large business database are not the same. To avoid any lapses in data 
access or retrieval, choose Linux based dedicates server host service. Browse 
online and read various customer forums to know more about Linux dedicated 
servers.</p>

<h2>Why Should You Choose Linux Dedicated Server Hosting Over Others?</h2> <br>
Jan 09 2012 <br>
<br>

<p>With the ever increasing necessity for companies to have websites, it is 
important to find yourself a host that will offer the best kind of package, 
considering the financial ability of the company. There are many hosts on 
offer, but one of the best choices will come with hosts that make use of Linux 
systems. Choosing Linux hosting services comes with its own pros that will give 
the company an edge above the rest when it comes to website management.</p> 
<p>Firstly, other hosting services come with their own viruses. There 
aren&rsquo;t half as many viruses that attack a Linux system as they do for 
some other platforms. In turn, there is a lot more security with the Linux 
platform.</p> 
<p>Next, the Linux platform is known to have experienced administrators, who 
make it more efficient for you to work on your website. Your operating system 
is in safe hands, meaning that the downtime that you will be experiencing for 
your site will be reduced. All that you will have to do is to make sure that 
you negotiate for a<strong>Linux dedicated server hosting</strong>. This means 
that your resources will not be shared by other clients, who would otherwise 
&lsquo;bottleneck&rsquo; your operations on the internet.</p> <br>

<h2>Wow, See The Advantages Of Having The Dedicated Linux Servers!</h2> <br>

Jan 06 2012 <br>
<br>

<p>Since more people are turning to the internet to learn more about 
companies, many companies find a need to ease the website traffic that may 
cause clients to back-off if the websites begin to function at slower rates. 
The best option for companies is to go for dedicated web hosting, where they 
can have all the resources they need for their operations. It brings more power 
to someone&rsquo;s business since it provides a way for visitors to go in and 
out of websites with total freedom.</p> 
<p>Linux provides one of the best platforms to make this work. Apart from 
having one of the most respected names in the world, Linux has been known to 
bring reliability as a host platform. This gives it more reputation, and being 
in competition with the Microsoft powerhouse, Linux offers features that are 
attractive to many server hosts all over the world.</p> 
<p>For the <strong>dedicated Linux server</strong>, you will not have to 
acquire all the licenses needed for each software package you use (which tend 
to become expensive). The software packages for Linux are free. In addition, 
there are very few viruses that are known to attack the Linux platforms. This 
means that the systems will become more secure, and more efficient than 
whenever other platforms are being used!</p> <br>

<h2>Get To Know Why Linux Dedicated Servers Beat Their Windows Counterparts!
</h2> <br>
Jan 04 2012 <br>
<br>

<p>Before choosing a server for your business, it is important to look at the 
requirements of your business and then decide on the type of server that is 
suitable for it. One has to make decisions such as whether a business will 
require a shared server or a dedicated server, and also, the operating system 
to use. Two main operating systems are most commonly used; Linux and Windows. 
These operating systems are preferred because of the many advantages they offer 
the users, and knowing each one is very important since they are different.</p> 
<p>People who prefer to use a <strong>Linux dedicated server</strong> as 
opposed to Windows do so because the process of installing applications is very 
easy. For Linux, there is the provision of root access, which might not be the 
case in Windows. In addition, Linux offers the best client security because 
viruses and malwares do not affect it, but rather affect Windows usually. A 
business must have assurance that their information, as well as client 
information, is safe at all times.&nbsp; Finally, Linux is freely available to 
everyone who is interested in using it. Unlike Windows where someone has to pay 
for the product, the acquisition of Linux does not require an individual to pay 
anything, making it very cost effective and affordable to use!</p> <br>

<h2>Linux Versus Windows for Cloud Computing</h2> <br>
Dec 22 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>Linux continues to increase its share of the server market while Windows 
server stays at a constant level. Most of Linux&rsquo;s acquisition has come 
from people migrating from other Unix systems but they still put the system in 
a strong position relative to Windows. Windows is expensive but the software is 
seen as reliable and complete. Linux offers a lot of opens source solutions but 
they may be a little incomplete at times. As Linux increases in popularity 
though the quality of the software that will run on it is increasing steadily. 
Choice isn&rsquo;t just about the software available though, especially if you 
will still be primarily using your server for hosting your website.</p> 
<p>If server access options are important to you then Windows and <strong>
Linux dedicated servers</strong> both offer FTP access but Linux is more likely 
to offer telnet or ssh as well. The programming languages you can run from 
servers are important as well with Linux being perhaps the most versatile which 
usually includes ASP and Perl but also PHP. ASP is more common on Windows 
servers but PHP is generally more useful. One reason why you may opt for 
windows though is that you can use it to run an Access database but my sql is 
more commonly used for database driven websites and available on Linux or 
Windows.</p> <br>
