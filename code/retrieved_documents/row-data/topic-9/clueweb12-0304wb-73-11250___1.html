<h2>The question of Linux vs. Windows for Kiosks and Digital Signage</h2> 
<p>Author: Bill Gerba on 2004-04-17 20:14:00</p>  The question of whether to 
use Linux or Windows software for a kiosk or digital signage project is 
obviously one very near and dear to my heart, since I am one of the founders of
WireSpring, and our FireCast product line is one of a very few Linux-based 
products on the market for these types of projects.
<p></p> 
<p></p>Ever since corporate powerhouses like IBM, HP and even Sun jumped on 
the Linux bandwagon, it seems that everybody is trying to come up with a cogent 
argument for why Linux is better than Windows, or vice-versa. While there is no 
question that Windows, with it's95%+ market share in the desktop arena dictates 
what is good and easy and expected and status-quo for desktop users, the 
picture is muchmore fuzzy when it comes to server-based, embedded and 
single-purpose applications, asany number of articles will purport to tell you. 
While everybody agrees that running a free copy of Linux on a $2,000,000IBM 
zSeries mainframe is more expensive than running a $500 copy of Windows on a 
$1,500 PC fromDell, no study, research publication or &quot;news&quot; site can 
tell you whether Windows or Linux is right for your project.
<p></p> 
<p></p>At WireSpring, we obviously believe in Linux as an operating platform 
for kiosk and digital signage applications. We gain all of the strengths of 
Linux, like built in security features and rock-solid reliability, without 
having to worry about its weaknesses, like the lack of certain software 
applications important for desktop use. In addition, with access to all of the 
source-code for theLinux kernel and various open source applications that we use
, we can optimize the entire operating system for use in kiosks or digital 
signs.
<p></p> 
<p></p>Since we don't have to worry about the perceived limitations of Linux 
systems, our purpose-built approach to kiosk and digital signage software is 
gaining a lot of attention in the industry. In fact, one of ourcompetitors has 
even gone to the lengths of setting up a &quot;Micellaneous<i>[sic]</i> FAQ
&quot; to discuss the situation. They make some good points about computer 
software in general, but in the end I'm left with the impression that they're 
trying to defend why Windows is<i>still</i> a good choice for signage 
applications. In addition, statements like, &quot;you can write a 'leaky' (eats 
memory until it crashes) on ANY operating system, Linux or Windows,&quot; aside 
from being in need of a good proof-read, are not 100% true, due to some very 
technical differences between the way Windows and Linux systems work. However, 
Scala does note that, &quot;the trick is to understand and test,&quot; which I 
do wholeheartedly agree with. Of course, since FireCast doesn't have to lug 
around all of the desktop-oriented baggage that a Windows system does, we have 
a lot less testing to do. This again seems to be a point in our favor.
<p></p> 
<p></p>I appreciate the gains in stability that Windows has made over the 
years. I'm still a Windows desktop user, and the fewer of Windows errors that I 
see, the better. But when you need a secure, reliability, remotely-managed 
operating system, &quot;better&quot; isn't good enough.<br>
