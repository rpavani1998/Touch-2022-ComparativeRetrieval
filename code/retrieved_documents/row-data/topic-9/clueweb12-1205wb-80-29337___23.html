it amazing you forget the idiot proof point and click GUI for every Microsoft 
program. It's usually only 3 or 4 mouse clicks and it's done. But there is 
absolutely no standard for those things and no guarantee that an uninstall 
works. Part of the purpose of distro package management is to correct such 
errors by individual developers. The distro's also keep track of security risks 
and other problems -- they are contributing a very significant oversight layer.
<br> <br>
 Anyway, I consider this: <br>
<br>
 apt-cache search some_package 
<br> apt-get install package <br>
<br>
 easier than: <br>
<br>
 - finding a 
website<br>
 - downloading a package <br>
 - playing with some wonky GUI 
interface that may be different each time.<br>
<br>
 So you have skipped a few 
steps that have to occur before you get to the apparently easy point and click, 
which you can save yourself all that trouble with one quick powerful command. 
Or two. Especially if you are working over a network via ssh, in which case you 
get no GUI.<br>
<br>
 Then, subsequent to all that, you can use the standard 
interface offered the package manager (by which I mean, yum or apt) to query 
stuff like what files a package installed, where they are located, etc.<br>
<br>
 yum:<br>
<b>repoquery --list package </b> <br>
 apt: <br>
<b>dpkg-query -L 
package</b> <br>
<br>
 Ba-boom, done. And like I said, one of those two works 
on EVERY linux system. Any and all distros.<br>
<br>
 Seriously: learn to love 
the command line. You will thank yourself for it later. You're a programmer, 
that tish shouldn't scare you. Also it's a great way to understand the 
fundamental elements of the system. You're a programmer: you<i>should</i> do 
that. </blockquote>

talking about a programmer's needs. I get that I could get more use out of a 
Linux machine. I've used it, and understand it. Don't care for it though. It's 
like the nerds version of a Mac. Instead of being the most snobby, it's who's 
the most geeky. I'm talking about 90% of America. Who installs multiple 
programs on a daily basis? Burning an ISO off a pre-installed Windows to undo 
what has been done for them makes no sense. Windows 7 came with my PC. It's a 
pain in the ass to hunt down a good distro, burn the ISO's, lose everything I 
already have.....only to gain something that isn't as compatable, has less 
support, and doesn't really do anything that I need to do.<br>
<br>
 Linux does 
a horrible job of selling itself. &quot;&quot;&quot;Oooh you can command line 
multiple downloads&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;Oooh you can look at nothing 
but text on Bash and uninstall things more thoroughly&quot;&quot;&quot;. That's 
not what America wants though. Windows comes pre-installed on most PCs, is 
geared towards the masses, and is available. Someone earlier mentioned the 
Office suite I think. Openoffice.org... works on windows too you know. I know 
of it because it was the ONLY program that ran Word documents on Linux at the 
time. </blockquote>

about all that, you are just repeating bland cliches about what users 
&quot;want&quot;. Keep doing that and they just might conform, like good 
consumers <br>
<br>
 It's a pain in the ass to hunt down a good distro, burn 
the ISO's, I suppose it was easier to earn the $1000 bucks you paid for the 
computer so that you can treat it as another opportunity to turn your brain off 
because you are too tired to think from earning the money you need to buy all 
these toys and tools that make your life &quot;easier&quot;. Dumbass viscous 
circle. That's all. You'd be better off doing sudoku on the couch. Or is that 
not &quot;cool&quot; enough for you?<br>
<br>

America wants though. Windows comes pre-installed on most PCs, is geared 
towards the masses, and is available. Linux is not fast food, and <b>it is not 
a commercial product</b>. That's part of the point. It is a fairly unique 
phenomenon in this sense. The idea that it has to be sold or promoted to people 
is just silly. Take it or leave it, but please -- there is no &quot;marketing 
budget&quot; and<b>I hope there never is.</b> <br>
<br>
 America is the 
birthplace of disposable crap and purile consumerist drivel of the worst sort. 
Maybe you have heard of the obesity problem and the steady decline in 
educational performance? I don't think &quot;what America wants&quot; deserves 
any kind of attention at all unless<b>you are out to make money feeding animals 
deep fried cheese</b>. Stimulus-response is not a sound foundation on which to 
orient the design of a computer operating system. And notice -- this OS is 
free. No money to make here! Move on. Take your marketeer savviness to KFC and 
point/click at the big shiny board over the counter. Burp. </blockquote>

<blockquote> The guys who don't like Linux come with things like &quot;Linux

more systems than Windows does. If you say that there is software that<i>won't
</i> run on Linux that <i>will</i> run on Windows, fine - I will give you that, 
but really, is that a fault of Linux? Has it got anything to do at all with 
Linux being a crappy OS? If a software company codes something that works on 
Windows, and does not give support for Linux, whose fault is it if it does not 
work on Linux? I mean seriously, if there was some app that only ran on Apple 
computers, would you bash Windows because it couldn't run it?<br>
<br>
 Or 
maybe the &quot;incompatible&quot; talk refers to hardware - like wifi and 
such. Still a no go - if the vendor of the hardware makes no driver for Linux, 
whose fault is it that it won't run? I don't get mad if I buy something with 
hardware that does not work on Linux. If I bought it without knowing whether or 
not it was supported on Linux, then I have to eat it. If I want to be sure it 
is supported I buy stuff that I know works. Such is the case with my computers 
at this time.<br>
<br>
 As an aside, I am kind of glad some things are not 
compatible with Linux. I bought an HP computer with Windows 7, and I am sick 
and tired of the nagware put on there by HP and Norton (again, this is not the 
fault of Microsoft - at least not directly) that I actually hate booting into 
Windows. The only reason I use Windows is to run Dragon Naturally Speaking - 
now that Nuance makes a dictation product for Macs, I see no reason to keep a 
Windows install around at all.<br>
<br>
 Now if some of you people like 
Windows, thats great. I have no problem with that, but don't go bashing Linux 
guys because it is the cool thing to be anti-Linux. </blockquote>

 I would think it's a 
problem of Linux having too many different distros. I'm not just spouting Linux 
hate. If I were running a server or anything requiring REAL work, I'd go with 
Linux. For regular PC use.. Don't see the need.<br>
<br>
 And yeah MK, I'm in 
college, working full time, and married with a 2 year old. I have NO desire to 
think when it comes to checking Fark and Cracked after work. I just want to 
click a giant logo and see entertaining stuff. I absolutely love my consumer 
crap. My new IPod is great!<br>
<br>
 I really do get it. I just think it's 
unfair to paint Windows in this light like it's the most junk thing in the 
world. I've yet to see how it's that bad for most people. And I would love to 
see Linux get in the game and take up a good portion of the market and have the 
right resources easily at my disposal.<br>
<br>
 I bet you guys couldn't even 
agree on a distro if I asked you which one was best. </blockquote>

really do get it. I just think it's unfair to paint Windows in this light like 
it's the most junk thing in the world. I've yet to see how it's that bad for 
most people. I think I can agree with you on some of this. I actually wouldn't 
recommend Linux to anyone. Not that it is bad, but it is not Windows. So often 
people are encouraged to switch to Linux (when Windows worked fine for them) - 
they try it and, after a bad experience, they not only turn away, but have 
scorn for it too. I have a name for these types of people - YAILH: Yet Another 
Inoculated Linux Hater. Now I will grant that things are a lot better these 
days, (I even know a 60+ year old lady who got Ubuntu working for herself) but 
there is still a lot to know to make the Linux experience pleasant. This 
knowledge typically presents a steep learning curve and for those who don't 
care to learn what it takes, it is an insurmountable obstacle. So I don't 
recommend it. I figure if someone wants to learn all the little things it takes 
to get a Linux system up an running, they will, they will stick with it, and 
they will get there under their own steam. For those who are happy without it, 
that's great.<br>

most people. And I would love to see Linux get in the game and take up a good 
portion of the market and have the right resources easily at my disposal.<br>

<br> I bet you guys couldn't even agree on a distro if I asked you which one 
was best. Like I said before, the distro's are 99% identical once you 
understand the system. I believe most of them were conceived for one of two 
reasons:<br>
 1) some bunch of reasonably curious and capable people thot it 
would be an interesting and beneficial pastime<br>
 2) politics within the 
community WRT what the platform &quot;is about&quot;<br>
<br>
 Anyway, glad you 
weren't upset by my last screed I'm perhaps in a minority of linux users in 
believing that it will be<b>bad</b> for it in the long run to 
&quot;popularize&quot; itself too much. I think it already has a robust and 
sustainable user base and that people will continue to be attracted to it in 
the future just like they were in the past. There is no need to try and pitch 
it or attract even more people. Like I said, there are no shareholders who will 
benefit, it's not a stock you can purchase, so achieving a greater market share 
is just a macho goal.<br>
<br>
 I think the problems you think might be 
corrected by attending to such a goal are not really problems with the system, 
they are just because you are new to it. This is not to say that there are no 
problems. Consider that &quot;linux&quot; of course refers to the kernel and 
the history of linux kernel development is unprecedented. But the issues there 
have very little to do with ease of use desktop-y issues, and which distro does 
what how. In reality, it's those things that have made the platform the success 
that it is.<b>The desktop is just a side show.</b> <br>

way. I have friends who have windows computers at home and the whole family 
uses them and such and I'd be nuts to think I'd be doing them a favor by 
recommending they switch to linux.<br>

forked into fedora, which is more or less the same thing, and kept the 
brandname for Redhat, which the money you pay is for support. It's for 
businesses, servers, that kind of stuff. They haven't really jumped any boats. 
Redhat is still (by necessity) all GPL licensed software, so there is nothing 
illegal about &quot;pirating&quot; it. Then you get no support, of course, 
which might be hassle if you are running a commercial server and cannot afford 
me (actually you could probably afford me, but get the picture). This is what 
&quot;not free as in beer means&quot;. Recently GNU and the FSF have dropped 
the term &quot;open source&quot; and gone with the more specific &quot;free 
software&quot;. Sometimes the term &quot;libre&quot; is used because I believe 
in the romance languages there are two words for &quot;free&quot;, with 
slightly different connotations. One of them is where we get<i>liberated</i>. 
So free as in &quot;out of jail&quot; and not necessarily &quot;cost $0&quot;. 
The jail here AFAICT has to do with<b>intellectual property</b> laws, which GNU 
is dead set against particularly as it has come to be applied to software. The 
goal nothing has whether or not a distro wants to charge money. That's totally 
permissible.<br>
<br>
 As an analogy, think what would happen if musicians had 
to actually perform instead of just collecting royalties, because all their 
recorded material was freely reproducible under law. Would fewer musicians 
become multi-millionaires for little or no reason? Yes. It would be very hard 
to make all that money if you actually had to<i>work</i> for it. Would the 
quality of music (not it's stock market value) in general be better? Almost 
certainly, because only people who really wanted to work as performing 
musicians would stick it out.<br>
<br>
 If only someone had the gumption and 
foresight to foresee what pure greed would do to &quot;the entertainment 
industry&quot;, we'd probably be living in a much more interesting world. So 
thank the universe for GNU/linux! Alternative philosophies. </blockquote>
