<br> Linux vs Windows <br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Choosing Windows or Linux Hosting </p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Web Hosting Articles&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Which one, Windows or Linux, 
is a better choice?</b></p> There is no definite answer for the question. Each 
one has their strengths and weaknesses, and merits and demerits. <br>
&nbsp; 
<br> Linux is treated as more secure and stable, but it is not much supported 
by its users. Though the average Linux user seem more technically sound than 
any other average computer user. So they appear more convincing. On the other 
hand, Windows too don&rsquo;t have many fans but still operated but still 
contributes to larger section of hosting community. <br>
<b>&nbsp;</b> <br>
 
&nbsp; <b>Stability of Desktop vs. Server</b> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
People, who are 
na&iuml;ve to the &ldquo;web hosting world&rdquo;, should add to their 
knowledge that they can use either Linux or Windows to host their web pages 
though those pages were developed on a desktop. It does not matter at all. <br>

&nbsp; <br>
Many have impression of Windows being buggy, insecure and unstable. 
But that is untrue, and there are different types of Windows, that are not same.
<br> &nbsp; <br>
Windows 95 and 98 had a never lasting problem of blue screen. 
Though, blue screen isn&rsquo;t the end of the system, unless you know how to 
get rid of it. Most of the times, you restart the computer. <br>
&nbsp; <br>

Here is a factual example of Windows 98 system. When the computer got booted, 
the startup applications like antivirus, a dictionary and similar other things, 
were loaded. As I got interrupted by the conversation with one of my friend the 
computer was idle for some time. When I got back to the computer, it flashed a 
blue screen. The blue screen appeared mentioning a problem and the computer was 
restarted. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
As mentioned no one used the computer in the mean 
time and no startup application had any problem. Such irrelevant problems has 
spoiled Windows name. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Windows XP is quiet stable and apparent, 
mainly because it is designed according to Windows 2000 which is a server. 
Stability of the Windows servers such as Windows 2000 &amp; Windows 2003 is 
much better compared to a different league of versions like 95, 98 &amp; Me. 
<br> <b>&nbsp;</b> <br>
 &nbsp; <b>OS Performance</b> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br> In comparison of Windows &amp; Linux, Linux attempts to handle more number 
of processes whereas in the same time Windows becomes unstable faster as more 
number of processes is run. &nbsp; <br>
<b>&nbsp;</b> <br>
 &nbsp; <b>Windows 
comes paid while Linux is free</b> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Linux is an open source as 
it is a joint effort of different volunteer programmers. <br>
Windows, similar 
to Linux, is a joint effort put by several programmers. These programmers are 
hired and paid for their job by Microsoft. Microsoft like any other business 
seeks to make profit from its products. Despite the monopoly of Microsoft, due 
to some reasons it is treated as a bad boy. <br>
<b>&nbsp;</b> <br>
 &nbsp; <b>
Which choice then you should make?</b> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The static HTML pages 
are interpreted as web pages that we see. They contain text, tables, or images, 
etc. Such original HTML pages can interpreted on any web server without 
considering the type of operating system. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Dynamic web pages 
like forum, shopping cart, etc are different from the static ones. They are 
used to send the information to the server which the server stores for further 
processing. These pages need a powerful programming language. The web pages may 
also include animated objects such as gifs. Two of such well known programming 
languages are ASP (developed by Microsoft) and PHP (open source product). While 
PHP has functionality over both platforms, Microsoft programmers care little to 
use it on other OS than Windows itself. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
So, my suggestion is 
you should go by your own specific requirements and choose the right platform 
that is suitable and efficient to accommodate your needs. <br>
