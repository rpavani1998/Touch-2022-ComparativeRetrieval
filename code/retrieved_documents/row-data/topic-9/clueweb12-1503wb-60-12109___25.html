<h2>Evolution of GNU, Linux System &ndash; Must Read For Newbies</h2>  Monday, 
November 7th, 2011 |Arizona Linux | 1 Comment <br>
<br>

<p>By Raghu Bharadwaj</p> 
<p>I would like to introduce you to a chronology of events that happened in 
the early 80&prime;s and 90&prime;s.</p> 
<p>Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project</p> 
<p>For Richard Stallman things started to look bad with the collapse of the 
free community at the Artificial Intelligence lab at MIT in the early 
80&prime;s, with modern era operating systems, none of them free software, were 
coming with a nondisclosure agreement which said, you are not allowed to share 
or change the software and if you want to get something changed, ask us to do 
it for you.</p> 
<p>This sounded anti-social to the software-sharing community that had existed 
for many years at the MIT, who enjoyed and agreed sharing their programs with 
universities and companies. And to see or to change the source code of an 
unfamiliar program to create a new one was quite common.</p> 
<p>After losing his community, Stallman always had the choice of joining the 
proprietary software world, writing code under nondisclosure agreements, which 
he believed divided the software society and a means for not helping a fellow 
hacker (&ldquo;Someone who loves to program and enjoys being clever about 
it&rdquo;) or quitting the computer field, which was rather an unpleasant thing 
to do as it would have wasted his skills as an operating system developer. 
Other way round was to build the community back by writing free programs again.
</p> 
<p><strong>GNU Project</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now the idea was pretty clear, what was needed first is an operating 
system. With a free operating system, a community of cooperating hackers would 
be able to use a computer without starting to deprive his or her friend. He 
chose to make the system compatible with UNIX so that it would be portable, and 
UNIX users could easily switch to it. The name GNU was chosen for the project 
following a hacker tradition, as a recursive acronym for &ldquo;GNU&rsquo;s Not 
Unix&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>The GNU project started with an objective to create a &ldquo;free 
software&rdquo; society, here the term &ldquo;free&rdquo; is often 
misunderstood and it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom. It is 
defined as:</p> 
<p><strong>&raquo;</strong>You have the freedom to run the program, for any 
purpose.</p> 
<p>&raquo;You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To 
make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source 
code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is 
exceedingly difficult.)</p> 
<p>&raquo;You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a 
fee.</p> 
<p>&raquo;You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, 
so that the community can benefit from your improvements.</p> 
<p>After quitting his job at MIT in 1984 Stallman began writing the GNU 
software. First he began by writing a compiler from scratch, which is now 
popularly known as GCC and the GNU Emacs editor for writing and editing his 
programs.</p> 
<p><strong>Free Software Foundation</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As users of Emacs were growing, more people were getting involved in the 
GNU project, and this forced Stallman to look for some funding. So in 1985 the 
Free Software Foundation (FSF) was created, a tax-exempt charity for free 
software development. Since then Free Software Foundation employees have 
written and maintained a number of GNU software packages, two notable ones are 
the C library and the shell.</p> 
<p>Gradually more and more programs were added to the GNU system and most of 
them gained popularity as they could run on the Unix systems, and users began 
extending them and porting them to the various incompatible versions of Unix, 
and sometimes to other systems as well.</p> 
<p>By 1990 the GNU system was almost complete, with a major missing link, the 
kernel, which actually does the job of managing the system resources. The 
decision was to implement the kernel as a collection of server processes 
running on top of Mach, a microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University 
and then at the University of Utah. This kernel named the GNU HURD (or 
&ldquo;herd of gnus&rdquo;) could run on top of Mach, and do the various jobs 
of the UNIX kernel.</p> 
<p><strong>GNU/Linux System</strong></p> 
<p>In 1991, a student from Finland named Linus Torvalds developed a 
Unix-compatible kernel and called it Linux. And around1992, combining Linux 
with the not-quite-complete GNU system resulted in a complete free operating 
system, the GNU/Linux system. It is due to Linux that a version of the GNU 
system could be run today.</p> 
<p><strong>GPL (GNU General Public License)</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>All the software under the GNU project were distributed under the GPL, 
which says that you can copy and distribute exact copies of the program&rsquo;s 
source code as you have received it. You can make changes or modify the program 
and again redistribute under the first mentioned condition, with clear notices 
of your changes and date of that change.</p> 
<p><strong>Linux Distributions</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Many Linux distributions based on the GNU/Linux system are currently 
available both as free copies and commercial distributions. Most of these 
distributors add up their own features, targeting specific areas like 
Enterprise, Desktop, Multimedia etc., to the existing GNU system, to cater 
diverse user sections. Some noted ones are RedHat, Fedora (an open project by 
RedHat), Debian, Suse from Novell, Mandriva, Ubuntu, Sabayon, PCLinuxOS, 
SimplyMEPIS, Knoppix, Gentoo etc. All these distributions intend to target 
different set of users. So you, now have the options of choosing the 
distribution based on your intended use, like suse, ubuntu, PCLinuxOS for user 
friendliness, debian, fedora for development, RedHat for Enterprise and so on. 
Least to say programming would be delightful on all of them.</p> 
<p><strong>Where do I get Linux?</strong></p> 
<p>Most of the Linux distributions are freely available for download from the 
Internet;</p> 
<p>Fedora from download.fedora.redhat.com</p> 
<p>Suse from novell.com</p> 
<p>Debian from debian.org</p> 
<p>There are also other links from where you can pull down these 
distributions. And if you do not want to waste time downloading, buy them from 
people like OSDisc.com, LinuxCD.org etc., but I am sure you would definitely 
find one, among your colleagues.</p>  Tags: FOSS, Free Software Foundation, GNU,

<h2>Linux PHP Vs Windows ASP Web Hosting Comparison</h2>  Thursday, December

<br>

<p>Linux PHP Vs Windows ASP Web Hosting Comparison<br>
 By Darren W Chow</p> 
<p>One of the first decisions to make while choosing web hosting is &ndash; 
what platform to opt for? Windows or Linux? PHP or ASP?</p> 
<p>First of all, note that sites with static pages such as blogs can run on 
either Windows or Linux hosting platforms. These only use HTML and CSS, which 
are supported equally well by both operating systems.</p> 
<p>When you require dynamic content on your website, such as eCommerce 
facilities, forums or other forms of scripting, then you need to pay attention 
to your hosting platform.</p> 
<p>Traditionally, Linux servers are used for scripts based on PHP or Perl. 
These scripts include WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and many other blogging or 
content management systems. Windows servers, on the contrary, are used with 
scripts written in ASP, ASP(dot)Net or Access. MySQL works equally well with 
both Windows and Linux. Today, cross-platform scripting &ndash; that is, 
scripting with PHP/Perl on Windows or with ASP/ASP(dot)NET/Access on Linux 
&ndash; is permitted by some ISPs.</p> 
<p>However, cross-platform scripting will never give the smooth performance 
that a program does when run on its native platform &ndash; it is a bit like 
using emulators to run programs that are not native to the OS. There is one 
exception here, though &ndash; PHP runs equally well on Windows and Linux, so 
Linux-based hosting is no longer essential to run PHP-based scripts and 
applications.</p> 
<p>Most computer geeks will advise you to go for Linux hosting, as Unix 
&ndash; on which Linux is based &ndash; is a far more secure and stable 
platform than Windows&rsquo; alternative. While this is demonstrably true 
&ndash; think of the millions of viruses for Windows systems, and the rare bug 
that crops up in Linux &ndash; it is also true that efficient server 
administration can render a Windows system as secure as a Linux one.</p> 
<p>Speedwise, there is no clear winner between Windows and Linux. Some things 
work faster on Windows, while others work faster on Linux. So to choose between 
operating systems, cost and security would have to be the deciding factors. 
Linux here is substantially cheaper, as it is an open-source system, and most 
of its applications are also under GNU public licenses &ndash; in other words, 
free. Windows hosting comes with the added cost of the OS, and certain 
applications that the hosting company has to continually pay for.</p> 
<p>As for the ASP-PHP comparison, ASP is almost universally the winner where 
speed is concerned. However, the learning curve in ASP or ASP(dot)NET is much 
steeper than in PHP &ndash; something that can backfire for advanced users 
looking for greater control and freedom. PHP, however, is still one of the most 
popular scripts around thanks to its versatility and the solid, useful 
applications being written using it.</p> 
<p>In the end, choosing between Windows ASP and Linux PHP as hosting platforms 
becomes a matter of individual preference and contingent need. Depending on 
your budget, security concerns and familiarity with the computer language, you 
can pick either of them and successfully run a dynamic website for a long time 
to come.</p> 
<p>Linux php hosting are generally more cheaper and faster compare to windows 
ASP hosting. For php hosting, we highly recommendFatcow hosting offering 
unlimited storage and unlimited domain hosting. Find more info from ourFatcow

<h2>Questions and Answers About the Linux Operating System</h2>  Sunday, 
November 29th, 2009 |Learn Linux - Linux help | 4 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Questions and Answers About the Linux Operating System</p> 
<p>By Andrea Tessi</p> 
<p>The purpose of this article is to give answers to some basic questions 
common people may have about Linux. Linux is a free operating system whose 
popularity is increasing day by day and passed from being the toy of a small 
geek group to a robust and mature piece of code so much as to start challenging 
Microsoft Windows leadership.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. What is exactly Linux?</strong><br>
 A. Actually three different 
things yet belonging to the same environment are named Linux. Originally it was 
used to name the kernel of the Linux Operating System (whose complete name 
should be hence &ldquo;GNU Linux&rdquo;) and eventually it was used to simply 
refer to the Linux Operating System. Finally, a lot of application software was 
added both by spontaneous programming groups and by software companies, 
creating software collections also known as distributions. So nowadays the name 
Linux is used for three different things: the kernel, the operating system and 
the distribution.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Who created Linux?</strong><br>
 A. The author of the Linux 
kernel is basically Linus Torvalds, a finnish computer science expert who 
developed it as an experiment during his university career. Later, a team of 
volunteers helped him improving and enhancing it.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Are Unix and Linux the same thing?</strong><br>
 A. No, though 
Linux has been written from the Unix code. Anyway, it is so similar to the 
operating system family known as &ldquo;Unix&rdquo; to the point that experts 
use to refer to Linux as &ldquo;Unix like&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Q. How much does it cost?</strong><br>
 A. Linux is free and it 
comes with a licence known as &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo;, which grants free use, 
free access to the source code (Linux distributions often come with both 
binaries and the source code), freedom to copy, modify and distribute it.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Are there many people using Linux?</strong><br>
 A. Nowadays 
Linux is becoming very popular. There are many people that neither are geeks 
nor computer experts turning to Linux every day. During the last 5 years Linux 
evolved to become very user friendly, and for some tasks even more than 
Microsoft Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Can I run a Windows program on Linux?</strong><br>
 A. Basically 
no. Linux and Windows are so different that a program written and compiled for 
Windows won&rsquo;t run on Linux and vice versa. An exception may be done for 
Java programs, provided that the Java Virtual Machine is installed in the 
system. However, a few developer groups and software companies are committed in 
developing emulators that make possible, under certain circumstances, to run 
some Windows programs on Linux.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Are there programs for linux similar to those running on windows?
</strong><br>
 A. Yes. For the most common tasks we can say that every Windows 
program has its free equivalent on Linux. In many cases Linux offers more than 
one alternative. The most famous are Firefox for internet surfing, Open Office 
for office automation (wordprocessing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, html 
pages, database and more), Evolution as an e-mail client, The Gimp for photo 
and image manipulation.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Can I run Microsoft Office on linux?</strong><br>
 A. No. 
Microsoft announced that they will never port (i.e. make it compatible) 
Microsoft Office to Linux. However, it is possible to run the original code 
(with some limitations, I guess) using a Windows emulator.</p> 
<p><strong>Q. Is Linux easy to learn?</strong><br>
 A. Linux has become very 
user friendly nowadays. For a normal user the learning curve is not steeper 
then for learning Windows or MacOs.</p> 
<p>These are some basic answers to questions people ask me when I tell them I 
use Linux. It still seems strange to most of them that somebody nowadays can 
use an operating system that neither is Windows nor MacOs.</p>

software and other interesting topics. Come to visit his new website that helps 
people find the bestcappuccino machine and discusses the 10 top selling 
cappuccino machines available in the market.</p>  Tags: GNU, GPL, Linus, linux,

<h2>Beginners Under Gnu &ndash; Linux? There Are Five Errors to Be Avoided</h2>
 Saturday, October 3rd, 2009 |Learn Linux - Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Beginners Under Gnu &ndash; Linux? There Are Five Errors to Be Avoided<br>
 
ByDidier Pradel</p> 
<p>To give the desire for testing linux so that it is one day your operating 
system, is one of the objectives of this site. The new users of GNU/Linux often 
make the same errors when they test GNU/Linux for the first time. The reasons 
of these errors are numerous: because GNU/Linux is a different OS; because 
Windows gives bad habits; because the user chooses the bad distribution and 
much of other possibilities. Here some solutions with five current problems 
under GNU/Linux.</p> 
<h2>1- To choose its distribution:</h2> 
<p>There is much opinion on the GNU/Linux distribution with which you will 
have to start, and the majority are not relevant.</p> 
<p>After having to seek, to study, read the opinions of users, with the wire 
of time, on many distributions, two points arise:</p> 
<p>the first: GNU/Linux Bureau is a question of taste,</p> 
<p>the second: not a distribution does not join together the whole of the best 
options.</p> 
<p>For start with GNU/Linux, it is to advise to choose among the following 
distributions, withoutorder:</p> 
<p>Professional SUSE and, in the future, openSUSE</p> 
<p>Linspire Xandros</p> 
<p>Fedora Core</p> 
<p>Mandriva (in the past Mandrake)</p> 
<p>Ubuntu</p> 
<h2>2- Is Linux free?</h2> 
<p>Some claim that all that is related to Linux is free. A good software 
deserves that one pays for him it is obvious, but the price must be reasonable 
the majority of the commercial distributions GNU/Linux for the office costs 
less than $100 and is really very rich. The term distribution meaning that a 
great number of software are gathered they also contain thousands of 
applications for the office. The commercial distributions GNU/Linux include 
word processing softwares, P2P, spreadsheet, presentation on transparency, 
edition file sharing of video, binary compatibility with Windows, virtual 
machine, reading of DVD, Web server, Web navigator, and much of others.</p> 
<h2>3- The partitions:</h2> 
<p>With Windows, you are accustomed to only one partition on your hard disk. 
It contains the operating system, the applications, the data, and a great space 
for your file of Windows exchange (the software uses space on the hard disk 
when the read-write memory is not enough any more). GNU/Linux functions 
differently. In order to obtain the best performances of the system, the file 
of exchange is on a separate partition. If you have 512 MB or 1GB of read-write 
memory the size the partition of exchange (swap) should not be lower than 512 
MB, and not lower than 1GB if you have less than 512 MB of read-write memory.
</p> 
<p>It is useless to make a larger partition if you use your machine only for 
office automation applications. With this solution you can safeguard the 
remainder of your personal and software data on a second partition. It is a 
good solution if you never change hard disk or operating system. But if you 
wish to preserve your data and the preferences of the applications which you 
use, it is to better do two other partitions for the operating system, the 
other for your data and your adjustments. that thus gives 1 partition root 
&ldquo;/&rdquo;, 2 partition &ldquo;/home&rdquo;. 3 swap the size depends on 
the number of software which you install, but 20 GB are more than sufficient 
for the partition root &ldquo;/&rdquo;root, the largest part of your disc must 
be to hold has&rdquo; /home &ldquo;, because it is there that you will store 
images, films, and other large files. It is wise to give 75% of the total disk 
space to the repertory /home, the majority of the GNU/Linux distributions can 
make the partitions for you, but they have all various ideas on the number of 
partitions to create and their size. you must decide if you want to change the 
default values. You can preserve your Windows partition and thanks to the 
dual-boot to choose to start your computer either under Windows or under 
GNU/Linux. You must install Windows in first to make only one partition but not 
too large not to obstruct the installation of GNU/Linux after. And if you want 
to exchange files between the Windows partition and the GNU/Linux partition, 
use the filing system FAT32 to format your Windows partition (Window does not 
read the partition linux and linux does not read partitions NTFS whereas it can 
read and write easily on a system FAT32).</p> 
<h2>4- The Permissions:</h2> 
<p>With Windows, you are in general either an administrator, or a user with 
the rights of administrator. With GNU/Linux, you are in general connect as a 
user to restricted access, and you pass as a root (i.e. administrator under 
Windows) when you must change important parameters of the system or regulate 
the hardware configuration or add or remove a program. This organization based 
on the permissions makes your system protected and one is accustomed quickly, 
although that is strange at the beginning.</p> 
<h2>5- To give up with the first problems:</h2> 
<p>GNU/linux is not Windows thus you enter a new world with new rules. To 
learn has to evolve/move in this new world will take time, it is normal. It 
will be necessary to learn from new software, a new interface, with a new 
manner of making. but once passed this stage hardest is made. The community the 
forums are sources of support as well as the site of your distribution if you 
chose a distribution commercial. To learn an operating system is a challenge. 
Essayer Linux is not in fact so hard and a thing is sure in any case: more you 
are frustrated with Windows and its problems, more the transition to GNU/Linux 
will be easy. Good luck! Those which want to install linux on a laptop will 
find hereThe linux laptop support a list of the laptop on which that was 
already done.</p>

laptop.</p>  Tags: Fedora, GNU, Linspire, partition, permissions, SUSE, ubuntu,

<h2>UNIX, GNU played important role in creation of Linux</h2>  Wednesday, May 
13th, 2009 |Arizona Linux | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Milestones in the creation of Linux</p> 
<p>+1960s No one can argue that with the introduction of Unix in the 1960s we 
would not have Linux today. It was originally developed by AT&amp;T employees 
at Bell Labs</p> 
<p>History of UNIX systems</p> 
<p>+1983 The GNU project was started with the purpose of creating a free UNIX 
style operating system consisting of free and open source software (FOSS)</p> 
<p>+1980s BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) was a free operating system 
project developed from AT&amp;T&rsquo;s 6th edition of Unix.</p> 
<p>+1991 Linus Torvalds realized his terminal emulator based on Minix was 
turning into an operating system, and this was the makings of today&rsquo;s 
Linux kernel</p> 
<p>Linus Torvalds</p> 
<p>+1992 Linus suggested releasing the kernel under the GNU General Public 
License. He first announced this decision in the release notes of version 0.12. 
In the middle of December 1992 he published version 0.99 using the GNU GPL.</p> 
<p>Linux and GNU developers worked to integrate GNU components with Linux to 
make a fully-functional and free operating system. Torvalds has stated, 
&ldquo;making Linux GPL&rsquo;d was definitely the best thing I ever did.&rdquo;
