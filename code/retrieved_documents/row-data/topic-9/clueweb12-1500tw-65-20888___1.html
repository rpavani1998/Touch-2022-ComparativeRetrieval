<h2>Windows vs. Linux &ndash; Which is Better?</h2> <br>

<p>With around 80 million Linux users and hundreds of millions of Windows 
users, it&rsquo;s an interesting question to pose &ndash; which one&rsquo;s 
best? Both have great advantages and so we&rsquo;re weighing up the main 
differences between the two in order to get a feel for what one really is the 
best.</p> 
<p>One of the main components many users take into account when choosing an 
operating system is how well they perform regarding software and hardware. 
Linux has a broad variety of available software programs and utilities 
available; however Windows far outweighs Linux in this respect simply due to 
the sheer popularity of it. Windows can offer a much larger selection of 
software programs and utilities that Linux simply cannot compete with.</p> 
<p>The same goes for hardware too. Whilst Linux has made great steps forward 
in hardware support, many companies still do not offer drivers or support for 
their hardware in Linux whereas almost all hardware manufacturers will support 
their products in Microsoft Windows and almost all hardware products are 
compatible with Windows.</p> 
<h3>2-0 to Microsoft Windows at this Stage!</h3> 
<p>Accessing servers is a major priority for many users and whilst both 
systems offer FTP access, which comprises of transferring your files from your 
hard drive to a web server, only Linux will offer Telnet or SSH access. It is 
indeed possible to set up Telnet access on Windows but very few hosting 
administrators will actually offer it. Telnet and SSH offer users a means by 
which they can open a window directly on a web server and manipulate files 
directly. Thus, if you&rsquo;re making use of<strong>dedicated servers</strong> 
then Linux could be the better choice for you.</p> 
<p>Another big factor for users is the security of the operating system they 
are using, and it would seem that Linux have hit the back of the net with this 
one! It has always been a very secure system and compared to Windows it is much 
more secure with far less attacks recorded. Meanwhile, Windows remains the most 
vulnerable to viruses and other attacks as spy bots and malware have been 
specifically designed to infect the masses of computers running Windows.</p> 
<h3>That&rsquo;s two in favour of Linux bringing the score level!</h3> 
<p>Furthermore, reliability is also a significant factor and historically 
Linux has been able to perform for months and even years without needing to be 
rebooted. Meanwhile, Windows has notoriously struggled in comparison with 
updates and reboots regularly required to keep it on its toes. It therefore 
doesn&rsquo;t come close to Linux in terms of reliability. Three-two to Linux!
</p> 
<p>Linux is also the cheaper of the two systems as most Linux variants are 
available for free or at a much lower price than the Windows equivalent. It 
looks to me like Linux has doubled its lead and could well stretch away into 
the distance. Linux is, however, the harder of the two systems to use and 
Windows is currently the preferred supplier all around the world.</p> 
<p>Everyone knows Windows but Linux does have a few strings to its bow. In 
addition, did you know that the popular Satellite Navigation systems, TomTom 
and Garmin, make use of Linux? This alone easily pushes the number of Linux 
users over the 100 million mark and makes the choice a lot harder than it may 
appear!</p> Tagged as: dedicated servers, Linux Servers, Microsoft Servers,
