<title>This is Linux.  Isn't it awful?  Please go home now.</title>

<h1>Hello</h1> Linux is becoming famous, even to users of Microsoft Windows 
operating systems who have no personal experience with it. Some of this fame is 
hype, and some of that hype is utter bullshit. Specifically, there are some 
lies being told to try to get Windows or Mac users to switch to Linux. Don't 
believe it. If you currently use Microsoft Windows or MacOS, and were 
considering giving Linux a try, read on to find out how you've probably been 
misled, and why you're most likely better off sticking with what you have now.
<h1>This is Linux</h1> Linux is not Unix, but it operates in a similar 
fashion, with the same fundamental constructs, and even commands which mostly 
have the same names and take compatible options. If you're interested in the 
history of Unix, you can readthis Unix history from Dennis Ritchie, or this 
history of Unix, Linux, and Gnu. 
<p>If you're an old hand with Unix, however, this article is not for you. 
Thus, I'll attempt to describe Linux by comparing it to modern PC operating 
systems like Microsft Windows and MacOS. Note that MacOS 10 is a special beast, 
and my comments here refer primarily to earlier versions. Also note that while 
I describe Linux below, most of the comments also apply to the BSD operating 
systems which run on a PC.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong>Linux is not developed by a corporation</strong> </dt> 
<dd> Microsoft Windows is sold by Microsoft, and MacOS is sold by Apple. At 
these companies, there are professional managers who decide how things are 
going to be, and the actual programmers are compelled to implement things in 
this fashion. This means that the products the company makes will have coherent 
priorities and objectives, determined by market research, the company's 
long-term plan, or managers' priviate political agendas. This means that when 
Microsoft decides that configuration is going to be done primarily via the 
graphical interface, the programmers can either implement configuration via the 
graphical interface or start collecting unemployment.
<p>Linux, on the other hand, consists of components largely developed by 
volunteers. Beacuse these people are not being paid to work on Linux, they 
cannot be compelled to do things in any way they do not like, as there is 
nothing with which they can be threatened. They do the work because they love 
it, and if they stopped loving it, they would stop doing it. This is the 
fundamental reason that Linux differs so much from proprietary operating 
systems. Understanding this difference is crucial.</p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>Linux is Free</strong> </dt> 
<dd> The people who write Linux, the Gnu utilities which support it, and most 
software for Linux give it away forfree. This means it also comes with source 
code, which means that you can modify it to make a custom version, something 
that is not possible (and is actually illegal even when it is technically 
possible) with proprietary software such as Microsoft Windows.
<p>To understand this, you have to realize that people who write software for 
Linux are not in the business of selling software. The Microsoft Corporation is 
in the business of selling software. Apple is in the business of selling 
hardware and software. This is what they do, and they could not possibly give 
it away for free instead of selling it, because they would immediately go 
bankrupt. Unix, however, got started differently. It was originally developed 
by AT&amp;T, which was very much<em>not</em> in the business of selling 
software - in fact, they were legally not allowed to sell software (see one of 
the Unix History links above for details). They were primarily<em>users</em> of 
the software.</p> 
<p>This tradition of development by users continues with Linux today. Most of 
the people who write components for Linux do so because they want, in the 
course of their work or hobbies, to<em>use</em> the component in question. 
Thus, they do not need to sell the component to get value from it - they get 
value from using it themselves. Furthermore, because their value is derived 
from the use of it, it is in their best interests to allow other people to 
improve upon it. If it is improved upon by others, the original author can then 
use the improved version and obtain extra utility without having put in the 
effort to improve it himself.</p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>The companies which sell Linux are not its authors</strong> </dt> 
<dd> There are some companies which sell Linux &quot;distributions&quot;, such 
as Red Hat. However, most of what these companies are selling are not things 
that they developed in-house, but instead generic Linux components which they 
obtained from elsewhere.
<p>These companies are like companies which sell electronics kits. The company 
draws up instructions, and packages components which are suitable for a 
particular purpose. The more advanced and enterprising ones have custom circuit 
boards printed. However, they do not manufactur the transistors and capacitors 
themselves - they obtain them from outside. Furthermore, the kit manufacturer 
has little control over the specifications of the parts they buy - if they 
would like some small change in a component to make it integrate better into 
their project, they are not guaranteed to be able to get this change from the 
manufacturer. Linux is similar - if Red Hat wants a change to a part of Linux, 
they'll have to ask the person or people who write that part, and they might or 
might not get what they ask for.</p> 
<p>In the case of electronics manufacturers, the kit supplier has little pull 
because the quantities they buy are so small. In the case of Linux, the 
distributor has no pull with the authors because they aren't paying the authors 
at all!</p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>With Linux, most customers are wrong</strong> </dt> 
<dd> As discussed above, some Linux distributions which sell their product 
want to keep their customers happy, and want to appeal to as many customers as 
possible. However, they money they get stays with the distributor, and never 
reaches most of the initial authors. Thus, the authors have no incentive 
whatsoever to work to increase the number of copies sold, or the number of 
users.
<p>The only sort of reward authors ever get is receiving improvements to the 
things they have written. Thus, the only people whose opinions they care about 
are those who are capable of making such improvements! Suppose there are 100 
non-programmer end users who want a feature to be implemented in one way, and 
one programmer who wants it implemented in a different way. It is in the 
initial author's best interests to do what the one programmer wants! The 
non-programmer end users will never contribute anything back to the original 
author, but the programmer may.</p> 
<p>This is completely different than the motivations of a company which sells 
a product, and the difference is important to understand.</p> </dd> </dl> 
<h1>Isn't it awful?</h1> Now that I've discussed the nature of Linux, I'll 
explain why it's probably not the right solution for home use by an average 
person.
<dl> 
<dt> <strong>Linux is tailored for the technically proficient</strong> </dt> 
<dd> Remember that authors of Linux software are generally people who want to 
<em>use</em> the software they write. This means, of course, that they design 
it to operate in a way that they would like to use. Because these people are, 
by definition, programmers, most of the software is tailored to be used by 
someone as technically proficient as a programmer. It is likely to be 
intimidating to someone with less skill. Furthermore, because most Linux 
authors receive no compensation whatsoever from an additional user using their 
software, there is no incentive for them to make it easier for non-technical 
people to use. 
<p>The figure to the right shows the the value of certain operating systems as 
a function of the proficiency of the user. Linux does more good than something 
like Microsoft Windows for an expert, but it does considerably less for a 
non-expert. There is a point on the figure at which Linux becomes more valuable 
than alternatives; use Linux if your proficiency exceeds this amount.<br>
</p> 
</dd> 
<dt> <strong>You are probably not technically proficient</strong> </dt> 
<dd> How can you tell if you belong on the left or right side of the chart? 
You can ask yourself some simple questions. If you cannot reset the time on 
your VCR when there is a power failure, you are not proficient enough to use 
Linux. If your watch alarm goes off at the same time each day, and you can't 
figure out how to turn it off, Linux is not for you. If you can't type without 
looking, frustration lies ahead.
<p> </p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>To use Linux, you must want to learn</strong> </dt> 
<dd> The design of Linux assumes that you want to learn. It's set up so that 
you can do things quickly once you've learned, but you won't be able to do 
things<em>at all</em> before you've put some time into figuring out what's 
going on. You are expected to study and understand the underlying operations 
that your computer uses to perform tasks before you attempt to perform these 
tasks. If you expect your computer to have a learning curve like your toaster, 
or you just want to &quot;get on the internet&quot; and &quot;do your 
email&quot;, you would have to be insane to try Linux.
<p> </p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>The distributors are biased</strong> </dt> 
<dd> Companies like Red Hat advertise a great deal about how easy to use their 
produce is. Well, of course they do - it's in their best interest to sell as 
many copies as possible. While I wouldn't call it lying, it's definitely 
marketing, and needs to be taken with a large heap of salt.
<p>Remember that while Red Hat would love for Linux to be as easy to use as 
possible, they are limited in what they can achieve. They cannot cause 
fundamental changes to most of the components in the distribution. If the 
Microsoft usability labs report that a certain fundamental change is going to 
be required to make the software easier to use, Programmer Bob at Microsoft is 
going to say &quot;yesssir&quot; to his manager when told to make the change. 
If Red Hat decides that a certain fundamental change is going to be required to 
make the software easier to use, Programmer Jim who works on Linux for free is 
going to say &quot;bite me&quot;, and go about things exactly the way he was 
before.</p> 
<p>In addition to distributors such as Red Hat, the people who make the Gnome 
andKDE environments are trying to make Linux easy to use. They will never be 
able to achieve the same level of success as Microsoft or Apple, however, 
because they cannot mandate changes to the underlying functionality to support 
ease-of-use like Microsoft and Apple can.</p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>You will not obtain the advantages for which Linux is famous
</strong> </dt> 
<dd> There have been some famous papers written comparing Unix-like operating 
systems, including Linux, to Microsoft Windows. Unix-like operating systems 
were generally found to be better, having advantages such as higher reliability 
and lower cost.
<p>Let's consider that. Suppose that a Windows computer reboots twice a day, 
and is down 5% of the time (these numbers are made up for the sake of the 
example). A Linux computer, properly installed and configured, would stay up 
for months and be down 0.1% of the time. However, you will not be able to 
properly install and configure a Linux server - so<em>your</em> Linux computer 
will never reboot, because it never runs at all, and it will be down 100% of 
the time!</p> 
<p>One of the largest advantages of Linux is the availability of source code, 
which allows you to modify programs to suit your taste... assuming you know 
how. If reading C is like reading Swahili to you, there's no advantage 
whatsoever in having the source code, because you don't know what to do with it 
anyway.</p> 
<p>Given the choice between $10 cash, or a locked safe containing $100, which 
would you choose? If you're an expert safecracker, it makes sense to choose the 
safe, but for the rest of us, we're better off choosing the lesser amount that 
we can actually use. So it is with operating systems.</p> </dd> </dl> 
<h1>Please Go Home Now</h1> Just as it's usually not to the advantage of a new 
user to use Linux, it's not to Linux's advantage either. Even if you're 
competent and Linux is ideal for you, please<em>don't</em> recommend it to <em>
other</em> people. This section attempts to explain why it is contrary to the 
Linux user's best interests to advocate Linux to the masses.
<dl> 
<dt> <strong>Incompetent Users Hurt Linux's Reputation</strong> </dt> 
<dd> There are many things for which Linux works well, although general home 
use is not among them. However, a home user who tries Linux and is unsuccessful 
with it will not come away from the experience thinking &quot;I'm too dumb to 
use Linux&quot;, he will come away from the experience thinking &quot;Linux is 
crap!&quot; He will then oppose the use of Linux at his company, or in other 
situations where it would actually work well and be an improvement.
<p> Of course, it also hurts <em>your</em> personal reputation if people 
follow your advice and have a horrible experience. That's hardly to your 
advantage.</p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>Incompetent Users Drain Linux's Resources</strong> </dt> 
<dd> Incompetent users never read the documentation before they ask for help, 
and they ask for help with the stupidest and most trivial problems. This wastes 
the developers' time. Even if the developer isn't going to reply to the email, 
time is still required to wade through it and sort it out from the important 
stuff. If the developer is a nice guy and actually replies, even more time is 
wasted! This is time which the developer would otherwise have spent making the 
software better, for the sake of assisting incompetent users who will never 
contribute anything useful.
<p> </p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>Myth: Once People Use Linux, they Will Learn</strong> </dt> 
<dd> This is a nice dream, but it's simply not true. Using an environment such 
as Linux will not encourage people to learn, because if they are not already 
inclined to learn and be curious, they will never notice any of the important 
differences between Linux and Windows! By all means, recommend Linux to people 
who have already demonstrated an inclination to learn, and are feeling limited 
by their current environment. If they haven't learned enough to feel limited, 
however, it is counterproductive to recommend they move to something harder. If 
they're happy with what they have, leave them in peace.</dd> </dl> 
<h1>Here's a postcard for your effort</h1> There are some situations in which 
Linux is an appropriate solution. General home use is not one of them, but I'd 
like to conclude with a list of what they are:
<dl> 
<dt> <strong>A company with professional system administrators</strong> </dt> 
<dd> The system administrators generally know enough about what they're doing 
that Linux would be advantageous for them. Even if other people at the company
<em>use</em> the computers, the advantage of having computers which are more 
easily maintained by the experts is often enough to outweigh the fact that they 
may be slightly harder to use by the users (particularly since there are 
in-house experts to help). This is true even from the point of view of the 
users - would you accept a system which is slightly more complicated, in 
exchange for having it not randomly fail for hours at a time like the current 
one? I thought so.
<p> </p> </dd> 
<dt> <strong>A computer you don't fix yourself anyway</strong> </dt> 
<dd> If you already get someone else (such as a relative, or the 12 year old 
next door) to do the work on your computer for you, you have nothing to lose! 
It doesn't matter if it would be harder for you to do work on your computer, 
because you're<em>not</em> doing any work on your computer. If you have sticky 
notes attached to your monitor reminding you the exact steps to perform certain 
tasks, changing to Linux will require you to simply replace your sticky notes 
with different instructions. It will be equally easy for you, and easier for 
your friend who does the real work on your computer.
<p> </p> </dd> </dl>  Now that we've discussed the profound lack of advantages 
to be had by converting people to Linux, get out there and keep your mouth shut.
