Perceptions: Is Linux 
a suitable desktop platform? <br>
by John H. Terpstra<br>
<br>
In this guest 
column at DesktopLinux.com, former SCO evangelist and Samba.org team leader 
John H. Terpstra weighs in on market perceptions about Linux and its 
suitability for the desktop. Interviewing a sample group -- that included 30 
people evenly split in the Linux and MS camps -- Terpstra discovered each group 
cited the very same arguments in defending their OS of choice! The author 
sought definitive answers about the state of Desktop Linux and reasons for and 
against a switch to Linux. The results, and key factors, were not as expected .

<b>Perceptions: Is Linux a suitable desktop 
platform?<br>
by John H. Terpstra</b> <br>
<br>
Reality often interrupts an 
otherwise perfect impression of life. This article started out as a simple 
exercise to collect background information for a presentation at a conference. 
The design and intent were simple enough, but my findings came as a rather rude 
challenge to return to present consciousness.<br>
<br>
My presentation was 
titled, 10 Reasons you CAN use Linux on the business desktop, surely this was 
an easy subject to address. Anyone who is familiar with Linux could complete a 
simple argument to prove the point. Think about it, Linux is a truly viable 
alternative tool compared with Microsoft(tm) Windows. After all, what is MS 
Windows other than just an operating system platform? Add in a few office 
automation tools, a web browser, an email client, and bingo! Proof positive, 
Linux can replace MS Windows. Right? Simple isn't it?<br>
<br>
Wait, wait, I 
hear a call, What about this and that? So to put the critics to bed, let's 
collect a little information from source published on the Internet. Surely one 
could expect to find a solid discussion somewhere that analyses user needs and 
wants. That examines buyer behaviour and that recognizes the task challenges 
that common people use their computers for. Oops, I did not mean that you dear 
reader are common, no injury intended.<br>
<br>
So Google to the rescue. You 
know how it goes. If I ask the right questions Google will yield a rich reward 
of simple proof, throw the facts together and out pops another presentation. 
Not this time though. I did a few searches that yielded the first set of 
confusing findings. Just try this yourself. Look for Reasons for Linux, Windows 
better than Linux and follow a few links around. What I found almost 
immediately were two articles that gave the same reasons for and against Linux 
on the desktop. One and the same argument for staying with MS Windows as for 
using Linux. Hey, wait, perhaps the same authors, maybe is someone playing a 
prank on us all? So I searched a little further only to find more evidence of a 
similar and conflicting nature. From a total of over 23,000 hits I filtered out 
22 key articles that I selectively decided to use as my proof material.<br>
<br>
Just one thing bothered me though, I know people who have VERY strong opinions 
regarding Linux and MS Windows. I reviewed my list of well opinionated victims 
with the intent to poll their opinions. I was certain that if I were to choose 
two groups of 15 people, people for and against Linux, each of whom were 
technically competent individuals, all of who make rational and comprehensible 
deductions involving information technology issues. I was sure I would find 
some positive facts to support the use of Linux as well as some really solid 
road-blocks to it's use. That is what I wanted to find hard evidence, I would 
report the obvious, tell everyone how journalists get it wrong and move on to 
the next conference. I was hoping to isolate factors that would help someone to 
improve Linux and to make it a more viable desktop platform.<br>
<br>
<b>Market 
Poll Method:</b><br>
<br>
I rang each individual on my list. Each call took 
around 20 minutes. The questions asked:
<ol> 
<li>Please give 5 top reasons why you CAN use Linux on the desktop<br>
</li> 
<li>Please give 5 top reasons why you CAN NOT use Linux on the desktop<br>

</li> 
<li>If you had to affect a significant reduction in IT expenditure, what would 
you change?</li> </ol>So as to not bias the feedback I listened and took notes, 
in most instances more than 5 points were offered. I was looking for simple 
answers not a dissertation. Thankfully, most answers were brief and to the 
point. One or two went on a little longer but all came to a clear conclusion. 
How does one classify the responses? Simple, look for common key words, or 
trigger issues. To do justice one has to retain each response within the 
context in which the answer was given. After all responses had been noted down 
I asked a few questions to get a better handle on what motivated points that 
seemed out of balance.<br>
<br>
<b>Findings:</b><br>
<br>
The 300 responses 
could be classified into around 10 key issues:
<ul> 
<li>Cost<br>
</li> 
<li>Reputation<br>
</li> 
<li>Applications<br>
</li> 
<li>Security<br>
</li> 
<li>Hardware Support<br>
</li> 
<li>Software Support<br>
</li> 
<li>Familiarity<br>
</li> 
<li>Ease of Installation<br>
</li> 
<li>Trust<br>
</li> 
<li>Performance</li> </ul>What follows is a review of key feedback items that 
demonstrates the each issue. It was disappointing that several answers related 
to Linux as a server platform, not as a desktop tool. What was even more 
significant is the not one person asked offered a reply to the third question. 
This interview was the perfect vehicle to reinforce the message that Linux is 
the best means of reducing the cost of ownership of an IT infrastructure. This 
message is thus not to be!<br>
<br>
<br>

<blockquote> <b>Cost:</b> <br>
<br>
<b><i>Pro-Linux Perceptions:</i></b> <br>

The economic environment is tough and IT budgets are being cut<br>
Linux is 
Free (10 mentions)<br>
Freedom from Operating System License Fees (server) <br>

No Client Access License Fees (also called the Microsoft Tax by two 
respondents) (fees levied to access servers)<br>
The cost of acquisition of a 
complete Linux based solution (server) is much lower than an equivalent 
Microsoft Windows solution.<br>
The cost of Linux support is much lower than a 
Microsoft Windows (NT4 / 2000) based solution.<br>
MS Windows requires on-site 
support staff.<br>
There are many free office automation solution choices (12 
mentions) -- OpenOffice / StarOffice can comfortably replace MS Office; 
WordPerfect 8 for Linux can replace MS Office<br>
Microsoft have increased the 
Licensing costs for MS Windows, they will do it again! (2 mentions)<br>
The 
Linux development environment is free and very powerful (4 mentions) -- no 
vendor lock-in (2 mentions)<br>
All needed business applications are available 
for Linux<br>
Corel PhotoDraw for Linux is free (1 mention) <br>
If a user MUST 
use an MS Windows application is can be run on Linux:
<ul> 
<li>Using the WINE application (2 mentions)<br>
</li> 
<li>Using Win4Lin (3 mentions)<br>
</li> 
<li>Using VMWare (4 mentions)</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<b><i>Comment:</i></b> <i> 
Corel PhotoDraw appears to be a discontinued commercial product and it is not 
free. Also, it seems obvious to me that with Win4Lin and VMWare one has to pay 
for this software as well as pay for the MS Windows license so why not just run 
MS Windows on the users' PC? Why does this fact escape the Pro-Linux opinions?
</i> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Microsoft funded IDC 
report that claims that the Linux TCO - 13% higher than an equivalent MS 
Windows solution (3 mentions)<br>
Linux requires on-site Techies to keep 
systems running (2 mentions)<br>
Linux requires on-site development staff or 
contractors to fix serious bugs and to apply kernel patches (3 mentions)<br>

Ultimately Linux using sites need to out-source support since a company can not 
rely on internal staff to remain current on all issues<br>
MS PowerPoint is the 
best presentation tool (everyone uses it) (10 mentions)<br>
There are NO open 
source alternatives to MS Access<br>
MS Visual Studio is much better than any 
open source IDE (2 mentions) -- Linux IDE tools are back in the Dark Ages! (1 
mention)<br>
Use of a CRM application that requires MS SQL, so it is cheaper to 
have just one platform.<br>
Linux users do not know how to use dial-up 
networking<br>
MS Windows networks can NOT be browsed from Linux workstations 
<br>Linux is immature will cause high costs in the long run <br>
There are no 
financial applications for Linux (MYOB and Quicken were mentioned: The issue 
raised was the ability to export data to users of these two applications.<br>

<br> <i><b>Comment:</b> The is a native Linux/Unix tool that can replace MS 
Access. It is called pgaccess and is a front end to the Postgresql SQL server. 
Pgaccess has an interface to SQL data tables, forms, reports, views, schema 
manipulation, stored procedures and scripts, as well as user management 
capabilities. It is possible to build a whole application in pgaccess, just as 
can be done with MS Access. There are other open source front end tools that 
allow replacement of MS Access as well as MS SQL server. Also, no respondents 
were aware that there is an ODBC driver for Postgresql and MySQL that will 
allow MS Access and MS Excel to use an open source SQL back-end system. It 
seems that Linux companies have NOT managed to get this message across at all. 
Also, not one respondent had seen the libsmbclient library capabilities from 
KDE konqueror that allows SMB network browsing.</i> <br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
 Both sides of the opinion gap believe that their preferred platform costs 
least to maintain none offered any concrete proof.<br>

<b><i>Pro-Linux Perceptions:</i></b> <br>
Linux is 
the fastest growing OS platform<br>
Linux is COOL! <br>
MS Windows users are 
stupid<br>
Linux is a more productive platform <br>
MS Windows is NOT a single 
platform 9x/Me/XP Home, NT/2000/.XP Pro are all different platforms
<ul> 
<li>Microsoft Service Packs punch further holes in the single platform 
proposition<br>
</li> 
<li>Try using a Windows 95 Video driver under Windows 2000!</li> </ul>
Applications work faster and more smoothly than MS Windows applications
<ul> 
<li>Linux applications are better for the job<br>
</li> 
<li>The Linux desktop offers more choices</li> </ul>Linux is more productive 
<ul> 
<li>applications works faster and smoother<br>
</li> 
<li>Linux applications and tools are better for the job<br>
</li> 
<li>Linux desktop has more choices</li> </ul> <b>Comment:</b> The comment of 
abuse of MS Windows users is a foolish jab that alienates and does nothing to 
bridge the credibility gap!<br>
<br>
<b><i>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</i></b> <br>
MS Windows is the MOST used OS Platform<br>
ISPs do NOT support Linux (PacBell 
mentioned directly)<br>
Linux users are know-it-alls (softened form of real 
term used)<br>
Every Linux distribution is it's own OS - poor backwards 
compatibility between updates<br>
OpenOffice loses MS Word document formatting 
<br>Windows applications allow the user to be more task focused than Linux 
applications
<ul> 
<li> No need to do software programming to make it work (1 mention)<br>
</li> 
<li>Windows applications are the best for the job<br>
</li> 
<li>MS Windows has one totally consistent interface</li> </ul> <br>
<i><b>
Comment:</b> I flew seated next to the CEO of an ISP who told me his whole 
company runs on Linux, that his company NEVER had a problem with a Linux user 
and that over 95% of support staff time is taken up helping MS Windows users to 
do things that are very simple to do! He mentioned that MS Dial-up networking 
issues were the singularly most frequent center of attention because Windows 
users tamper with their settings all the time.</i> <br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> 
Clearly, the anti-Linux sentiment is reflective of pro-Linux opinions that 
alienated the pro-Windows people. No-one likes to be told that they have made 
the 'wrong' decision.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Applications:</b> <br>
<br>
<i><b>
Pro-Linux Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
The Linux Graphical Interface is just as 
easy to use as MS Windows<br>
Linux uses Industry Standards compliant protocols 
-- Industry Standard File formats also<br>
We can never be certain which 
Microsoft patches need to be installed:
<ul> 
<li>Too many to choose from<br>
</li> 
<li>Don't trust MS patches because of many instances of downtime caused by 
faulty patches</li> </ul>Linux offers great Interoperability <br>
<br>
<b>
Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b> <br>
There are very few Linux applications 
<ul> 
<li>We can NOT do without MS Outlook Client<br>
</li> 
<li>You can NOT buy MS Exchange Server for Linux<br>
</li> 
<li>Linux is NOT compatible with the Internet Explorer 6 standard<br>
</li> 
<li>Can't buy a decent live email backup client for Linux like the one we 
bought for Outlook<br>
</li> 
<li>There is NO PC Anywhere for Linux (and that is our help-desk and 
administration standard)</li> </ul>Linux printing stinks <br>
Linux Media 
Players stink<br>
Interoperability will NEVER happen! <br>
<br>
<i><b>Comments:
</b> Ximian Evolution looks and works just like MS Outlook but no pro-Windows 
respondent knew of this tool. Pro-Windows respondents saw MS Exchange as 
synonymous with Internet email Mircosoft have done a good job with their 
messaging here! I also asked the pro-IE6 respondent how compatible his IE5.5 
and IE5 systems were with IE6 and he could NOT see the point of my question. 
When I mentioned industry standards compliance he replied that I should just 
accept the fact that what everyone uses is the standard.</i> <br>
<br>
<b>
Conclusion:</b> Opinions share no common ground. Both sides come from a my 
world is best perspective and solve the same task problem a different way.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<b>Security:</b> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Linux Perceptions:</b></i> 
<br>There is no such thing as a Linux virus, all viruses are just programs! <br>
Linux has no obscure protocols/services makes it easier to lock down<br>
Linux 
us not vulnerable to WORMS
<ul> 
<li>The IRC Trojan IIS Worm just can not happen with Linux<br>
</li> 
<li>The Slammer worm killed many networks in January because MS SQL is too 
hard to secure</li> </ul>Windows security breaches are on the increase <br>

Microsoft shipped a faulty NT4 patch that took my network down in December 2002 
MS had to withdraw this patch!<br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b></i> 
<br>Linux is NOT secure, after all it is made by back-yard hackers! <br>
No-one 
is responsible for Linux Integrity - Who do you sue if Linux fails?<br>
MS 
Windows has a single sign-on facility that is much more secure than anything 
Linux has to offer<br>
There are lots of reputable 3rd party companies that 
produce (anti-)virus software.<br>
Microsoft have been focusing on solving the 
security issues and will release a hardened Windows soon
<ul> 
<li>1 year in the making and no small task<br>
</li> 
<li>There is NO Linux equivalent!</li> </ul> <b>Conclusion:</b> Each 
respondent answered from their own experiences and with their own specific 
biases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Hardware Support:</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Pro-Linux 
Perceptions:</b> <br>
Linux has comprehensive support for: 
<ul> 
<li>Video Controllers<br>
</li> 
<li>USB (Plug and Play)<br>
</li> 
<li>Modems<br>
</li> 
<li>Mice<br>
</li> 
<li>Monitors and Everything</li> </ul>HP, Lexmark and Epson offer great Linux 
printing solutions<br>
<br>
<b><i>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</i></b> <br>
Linux 
does NOT support
<ul> 
<li>GDI Printers<br>
</li> 
<li>Winmodems<br>
</li> 
<li>Video Cards<br>
</li> 
<li>PCMCIA cards</li> </ul> <b>Conclusion:</b> Linux does NOT work well with 
devices that are more or less specific to MS Windows (surprise!) and that means 
that the companies that produce them are going to miss out on purchase 
decisions made by the growing number of pro-Linux buyers. But both platforms 
clearly offer a usable choice of alternatives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Software 
Support:</b> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Linux Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Community help 
is fast and free<br>
One can use VNC to support BOTH Linux and MS Windows 
network clients<br>
Linux software is easier to keep up to date 
<ul> 
<li>Also easier to deploy<br>
</li> 
<li>Does not need as much support as MS Windows</li> </ul>Linux has the best 
remote administration tools (like rsh, ssh, webmin)<br>
With Linux it is easier 
to image hard disks for replicated deployment<br>
MS Windows is too complicated 
to manage / maintain<br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Many 
vendors do NOT support Linux
<ul> 
<li>Vendors can not make any money from Linux users<br>
</li> 
<li>Some Linux vendors do NOT support Linux<br>
</li> 
<li>Can't buy help desk support contract for Linux</li> </ul>We can not find 
anyone who knows how to do things that are simple in MS Windows<br>
There are 
not unified Linux network management tools: nothing like Microsoft MMC<br>
MS 
Windows has the more mature rapid deployment tools (eg: Norton Ghost)<br>
Linux 
is way TOO complicated<br>
<br>
<i><b>Comment/Conclusion:</b> We are still 
suffering a knowledge gap. Neither side has come to grips with the other's 
perspective and believes their own stories regardless of reality. Clearly, 
Linux support is NOT as comforting to all corporate administrators as advocates 
might believe. Equally, The pro-windows respondents are unwilling to weight the 
real cost of the liabilities of their current infrastructure solutions this 
leads to an unwillingness to seriously consider alternatives. One respondent 
severely criticized Microsoft for problems some users experienced with Internet 
Explorer but then excused this as a necessary side effect of a maturing 
technology while at the same time laying aside all consideration that Linux 
might be going through the same maturation process.</i> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Familiarity:</b> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Linux Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
The Linux 
Desktop is just like the Microsoft Windows desktop<br>
OpenOffice is very 
familiar to users of MS Office<br>
Linux is easier to deploy than MS Windows 
<br>Comment: The respondent who answered that Linux was easier to deploy than 
MS Windows had never deployed MS Windows! Rather an uninformed opinion!<br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Familiarity is Microsoft's key 
score card item!<br>
Linux is daunting to new users <br>
Windows is more 
predictable than Linux is<br>
Windows XP Pro is easier to deploy (esp. for 
1,000's of desktop installations)<br>
<br>
<i><b>Comment:</b> The Linux is 
daunting comment came from an administrator who had NOT used Linux in over 2 
years. The last comment came from a respondent who had tried to automate the 
roll-out of Red Hat Linux but complained that 'kick-start' preparations for his 
3000 plus workstations would be too time consuming. He claimed that a single 
auto-install profile for MS Windows XP Professional roll-out could meet the 
needs of ALL workstations and that he was more familiar with rolling out MS 
Windows than Linux.</i> <br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> More evidence of a 
knowledge gap, although the criticism of difficulty of Linux deployment seems 
like an informed comment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Ease of Installation:</b> <br>

<br> <b><i>Pro-Linux Perceptions:</i></b> <br>
Linux GUI installers are easier 
to use than MS Windows XP's installation process<br>
Linux Mass roll-out is 
easier (requires fewer staff) and is less costly than Windows XP<br>
Linux 
installation is a once only affair<br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b>
</i> <br>
Linux means I have to get rid of all current software and deploy all 
new stuff -- means I can not use my existing MS Windows application servers<br>

<br>Nearly all new machines come pre-installed with Windows 
<ul> 
<li>so why throw it away?<br>
</li> 
<li>why go through the pain of installing something else?</li> </ul>Everyone 
(users) know how to install MS Windows software, with Linux I'd need and army 
to install applications<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> Respondents from both sides 
admitted to not liking to deal with installation, no matter how easy it might 
seem. While there is a knowledge gap here, responses ring of I prefer what I 
know best<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Trust:</b> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Linux 
Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Linux is based on the same open source software that 
powers the Internet<br>
I KNOW Linux CAN be trusted <br>
Anyone who buys 
Windows SHOULD get fired, Windows is not reliable, can't trust it!<br>
I trust 
OpenOffice<br>
Microsoft are too dominant <br>
Open Source means: 
<ul> 
<li>No restrictions EVER!<br>
</li> 
<li>No Vendor 'lock-in'</li> </ul> <b><i>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</i></b> <br>

I have NO idea who to call for Linux Help, we have no trained staff to support 
Linux<br>
Linux desktop Interfaces are confusing (KDE/Gnome/etc) 
<ul> 
<li>Don't feel comfortable with adding to menus<br>
</li> 
<li>Had past bad experience with setting up menus</li> </ul>I could get fired 
if Linux fails<br>
I trust MS Office tools <br>
No-one gets fired for buying MS 
Windows<br>
Open Source means: 
<ul> 
<li>No roadmap<br>
</li> 
<li>No future<br>
</li> 
<li>No money for resellers and that means no resellers</li> </ul> <b>
Conclusion:</b> There is a big gap in the area of 'trust' , some of which is 
due to lack of exposure and lack of familiarity. Fear of exposure is the key 
factor here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Performance:</b> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Linux 
Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Apache is faster than IIS <br>
Samba Rocks! <br>

Squid is great! MS Proxy is a dog!<br>
Postgresql/MySQL are better and faster 
<br>One can comfortably use older hardware with Linux (it is fast and lesser 
hardware)<br>
Linux is Stable with good uptime <br>
MS Word is big and clumsy 
<br> <br>
<b>Comment:</b> The assertion regarding Postgresql and MySQL referred 
to use of an SQL server for web applications. The observations were NOT based 
on any actual comparison with MS SQL server. They thus represent a bias and not 
an evaluation!<br>
<br>
<i><b>Pro-Windows Perceptions:</b></i> <br>
Samba has 
locking problems, it corrupts files and that is bad, bad, bad, bad!<br>
MS SQL 
is the best, it is fast and easy to configure<br>
Windows 2000 Server supports 
bigger files<br>
Old hardware is unreliable and should not be used <br>
Linux 
has NO answer for MS Terminal Server<br>
Windows 2000 Server is NOT the faster 
file and print server, BUT it is 100% compatible!<br>
<br>
<i><b>Comment:</b> 
The comment pertaining to Samba was based on a web search and NOT from 
experience, the fact is that locking problems could easily also be experienced 
with MS Windows (and the respondent knew that but was of the opinion that if 
Samba could NOT solve problems that MS Windows has then there is no reason to 
use it). The MS Terminal Server issue was raised by two respondents, neither of 
whom were aware of VNC, the Citrix ICA client for Linux, nor of other tools for 
MS Windows terminal server access from Linux systems. Additionally, MS Windows 
specialists knew only of Telnet and hated it! When I mentioned the ability to 
run remote X-sessions with Linux there was a stunned disbelief that this would 
work. The assertion that Windows 2000 Server supports larger files was based on 
the understanding that Linux has a 2GB file size limit. Windows 2000 supports 
files of up to 4Terabytes, Linux 2.4.x with the XFS or JFS file systems support 
much larger files than MS Windows 2000, but I am NOT aware of anyone who has 
hit either limits for MS Windows 2000 or for recent Linux implementations 
(Samba is limited by the file system on which it runs).</i> <br>
<br>
<b>
Conclusion:</b> Fear and lack of familiarity are the key issues among MS 
Windows users, excessive confidence among Linux users is just as much a barrier 
to convincing MS Windows devotees to at least become more familiar with Linux.
</blockquote><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusions:</b><br>
<br>
If Linux were the same 
as Microsoft Windows then it would BE Microsoft Windows. Thankfully, it is not 
and thus there is a choice. Linux CAN substitute for MS Windows on the desktop, 
but it will NOT suit everyone. Linux DOES provide all the environmental tools 
that MS Windows users are familiar with, although they are not identical and 
they offer a different look and feel as well as different features. That too 
gives rise to choice that the user has the ability and freedom to exercise.<br>

<br>Some say the Linux desktop is wonderful today, others are of the opinion 
that it needs to mature further. There are some legitimate barriers due to the 
inability to run certain essential applications on Linux that are available for 
MS Windows. But there will always be someone who can find reason to object, no 
matter if the desktop platform is Linux or MS Windows.<br>
<br>
No matter which 
way you analyze the responses, Linux is a contender for the business desktop. 
Users have every right to choose their desktop of choice. For the large 
organization the total cost of ownership will be a deciding issue, particularly 
in a tight economy.<br>
<br>
The key battle for Linux is NOT primarily a 
technology issue today, it has much more to do with knowledge and acceptance. 
In many ways Linux is today where MS Windows 3.0 was in 1989 on the radar set, 
and climbing.<br>
