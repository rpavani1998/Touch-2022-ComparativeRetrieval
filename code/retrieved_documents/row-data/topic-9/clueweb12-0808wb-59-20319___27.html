<h2>5 Reasons Why Microsoft is Afraid of Linux</h2>  Posted by jun auza  On 
7/08/2009 <br>
Apple (Mac OS X) has a relatively larger number of desktop 
computer users compared to Linux, and Windows virtually dominated the overall 
market share. But have you ever wondered why people at Microsoft and evenBill 
Gates himself are bothered by Linux more than anything else? I think here are 
the main reasons why:<br>
<br>
1. Portability <br>
<br>
There's no doubt that 
Linux is a highly flexible operating system that can be easily modified to run 
on just about anyelectronic device. Meanwhile, Apple's Mac OS X is tightly 
locked on its own hardware so I don't see its growth as long-term. I believe 
there will come a time that a Linux-powered computer or gadget becomes 
immensely popular, and Microsoft's dominance will be endangered.<br>
<br>
2. 
Cost <br>
<br>
I know it's hard to promote a product that costs nothing. But in 
these difficult times people have learned to value their money more than ever 
by spending it wisely. Linux sure is free but its capability is valuable.<br>

<br> 3. Security <br>
<br>
Windows is still the most insecure OS and it is 
possible that anotherdevastating virus will strike and harm computers running 
with it. WithLinux getting better like becoming user-friendlier and more secure 
than ever, people have a savior.<br>
<br>
4. Firefox <br>
<br>
Since Firefox 
has beenrapidly eating Internet Explorer's web browser market share, the free 
and open source software community is more positive than ever that Linux can be 
as successful on the desktop. Microsofties are aware of this and are doing 
everything they can tostop the growth of Firefox and in effect Linux. <br>
<br>

5. Applications, applications, applications <br>
<br>
The number of great FOSS 
applications that support Linux are increasing. In terms of quality, they can 
rival any proprietary software made for Windows. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s like if 
you can do it on Windows, you can do it on Linux too.<br>
<br>
The year of the 
Linux desktop is unknown, but the future is bright. Indeed the good people at 
Microsoft have reasons to be afraid, or shall I say be very afraid of Linux :-)

<p>1. Portability - your argument is confusing, are you comparing to Apple or 
MS here?<br>
<br>
2. Cost - 0 cost is fair enough for pretty unusable product. 
Tell me did linux already penetrated the desktop market? As long as the current 
state of the desktop linux remains the same there's nothing MS needs to be 
afraid of.<br>
<br>
3. Security - this argument is valid only for windows xp 
sp2 era. Funny thing about security is pretty much every OS in the planet have 
security issues, in short everything is insecure even your dearest linux my 
friend.<br>
<br>
4. Firefox - the last time i check, firefox also runs on 
windows, so what's the advantage of linux here?<br>
<br>
5. Applications - let 
me give you a nice rebuttal for choosing windows. GAMES GAMES and more GAMES!

<p>Ah yes, the standard Windows FUD from the anonymous troll.<br>
<br>
1. ARM 
- Windows running on that yet?<br>
<br>
2. Cost/useability - I am an elementary 
school teacher, wife a social worker. Only computer class I ever had was back 
in 1982. Our operating systems on our three computers which are a 9 year old 
emachines, a 3 year old Dell laptop and an Aspire One: Antix and Fedora. 
Operating system use at my church's computer lab for neighborhood kids, Ubuntu.
<br><br>
3. Security: Cornficker infects Vista too. 
http://forums.techarena.in/vista-security/1150576.htm<br>
<br>
4. See above, 
the advantage is no Windows.<br>
<br>
5. Applications: Not much use if your 
computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>Windows FUD? If a windows guy is stating facts it's FUD if it's coming from 
Linux a**holes it's not.<br>
<br>
1. ARM - 
http://www.arm.com/products/os/windowsce.html - go on read it, i'll wait. oh 
and notice the url it's ARM, let me guess you will windowsce is not windows 
because of CE.<br>
<br>
2. No wonder, have you visited some big companies in 
your area, like banks, for instance, is your rural bank using Linux? I doubt 
it. A lot of universities here and abroad are still using Windows, it's a fact. 
Try visiting a universities like here in cebu, I don't know how many have 
installed linux. but i bet you will see a lot of windows machine.<br>
<br>
3. 
Security. Given the number of windows computers used in big compaines, have you 
heard anyone going out of business because of your cornficker worm? nope, 
because there's a damn fix for that one.<br>
<br>
4. unless if they stop making 
firefox for windows you will see it as an advantage. Even google given there 
sheer number of brilliant engineers recognize it as a dominant platform. Like 
they release chrome for windows first before your linux. Because ordinary users 
don't give a damn if your Linux is cool because you can compile your programs 
yourselves.<br>
<br>
5. Now this is FUD, you can suck my windows ASS. Sour 
graping loser.</p>

<p>//Ah yes, the standard Windows FUD from the anonymous troll.<br>
Remember - 
FUD works both ways, and this time you were the one to start FUDwar.<br>
1. Mu 
buddy got linux running on some low-standard mp4 (not an iPod, not a Creative). 
I bet noone can do that with windows nor MacOS.<br>
2. Linux is free from 
charge and there are many progs ready for use with most of distros. You don't 
even need best gear to run most of needed tools nd games built for linux. On 
the other hand: students at college or university can get Microsoft Operating 
systems and some office programs for free and are legitimate to use it as long 
as they study.<br>
3. I run linux for like an month, and yet no security breach 
occured. During this time peroid, my dad's XP got some spyware/trojan (that I 
yet didn't managed to clean) rendering it totally useless. What's the point of 
having many office apps if due to some viruss you can't even use them?<br>
4. 
Leaving IE is sometimes the first step people do to leave Windows OS. Altough, 
Firefox is not the best example. I'd rather mention Iceweasel, Konqueror and 
other linux-natixe browsers that are unusable at Windows. Plus, I myself like 
Opera - which works even on Windows 98SE, and is a bit faster (my CPU is slow 
enough to make the difference noticeable).<br>
5. a) Applications: Not much use 
if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot. I have an examle of this 
at home.<br>
b) Sure, many games aren't aviable for linux. But, usage of WINE 
or CEDEGA shortens this list. Furthermore, games that run on both windows and 
native linux tend to work faster at linux than on Windows.<br>
c) show me some 
custom window managers for Windows, as I know none. Are they as configureable 
as Linux ones? Are they supported by operating system? Are they safe? Window 
manager like Openbox makes you work lighting fast as soon as you get used to 
configuration you choose. I never got up to this speed with *ANY* of Windows 
OS. And I used every Windows since 3.11 (except server editions).</p>

<p>U can also game on linux. Most games will run on wine with some tweaking, 
even Crysis(only on high graphics or above). Also I'd rather get actual work 
done on my pc without getting bsod or my system slowing down. Try running a 
windows and a linux system for a year with out any maintenence software. the 
windows pc will be shit slow. also most users can't maintain their systems 
anyway so a user friendly linux alternative is actually a viable sollution in 
the future.</p>

1. linux is portable. windows 
is sort of portable.<br>
<br>
2.linux is free and works great :p. you havent 
tried linux or are just bashing it because you dont like it. no tux bashing. no 
no no no.<br>
<br>
3. windows is still plagued by dangerous viruses for example 
ransomware. and yes no system is entirely secure but windows does not even come 
close to being secure ;).<br>
<br>
4. dont have to use firefox can use 
anything. opera, lynx, w3c, dillo, the list goes on.<br>
<br>
5. lack of games 
is the fault of the publisher not linux.</p>

<p>The only thing that I think that isn't all to on the ball with the linux 
thing is firefox. Even though firefox does run on linux it also runs on 
windows. As microsoft has 80% of the desktop market, I think you tell where I 
am going with this one. Other than that the rest of your statements are spot on.

<li> <strong> Steve Nihan </strong> Said,  July 9, 2009 5:54 AM <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>My apologies in advance for feeding the trolls, however:<br>
<br>
1. 
Portability.....what are you looking to port? If it's C or C++ based...how 
difficult is it really? I've heard tell of C &amp; C++ apps running in linux 
with some recompiling (not sure how true that is).<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm a 
firm believer of creating software that will run on any platform, independent 
of the OS.<br>
<br>
2. Cost - I'm a windows user....sure...but only through 
VirtualBox now. While I AM a MS SW engineer, I prefer to use fedora 11 x86_64 
(gnome) as my DESKTOP. I can now run 3 VM's simultaneously...while listening to 
music on the free Rhythmbox...with still plenty of memory &amp; disk space left 
over. The same CANNOT be said running Vista Business x64, or even Windows 7 X64 
(even removed the extras) for that matter.<br>
<br>
3. Security - Timdor is 
completely correct. While there is the UAC built into Vista, unfortunately, 
I've still seen virii come through, and have even tested the conficker worm 
myself. Sorry Vista, but the short fact remains...most viruses built are built 
to target the MS Windows OS, whether that be xp, vista, or 7.<br>
<br>
4. 
Firefox.....true...it DOES run on both OS's. Why should that be a hindrance? I 
would thing that it would put the company in a better position, as it doesn't 
require a specific OS, and therefore is not dependent on the specific OS, which 
in turn offers additional security flaws and vulnerabilities. While I DO enjoy 
the performance gains of IE8, I don't appreciate the forcible nature that 
Microsoft integrates some of the IE8 features and addons.<br>
<br>
5. 
Applications. Ok...games are fine I'm sure.....if you're a teenager hell bent 
on fragging people in high def FPS realism. I should also mention, that many 
windows games can be played through Wine, if that really is your thing. 
Personally, I play wow through wine, with no performance loss. In fact...I 
listen to music while I play....so there's another performance benefit.<br>

Personally, I think that if the only reason you're buying MS Windows is for the 
games, you really ought to just get yourself a gaming console.</p>

<p>To the twats arguing that WindowsCE on ARM = Windows portability.<br>
<br>

Get your ARM, Get Windows CE. Now, two things -<br>
1. How many hardware 
drivers do you have for your new platform? Can you plug in all your desktop 
peripherals and use them? NO. You need to wait for all the hardware vendors to 
port and release their drivers.<br>
2. How many applications do you have for 
your new platform? Can you run all your old desktop apps? NO. You need to wait 
for all the hardware vendors to port and release their apps too.<br>
<br>
Yes, 
for any OS, the drivers and apps need to be recompiled along with the OS kernel 
and others subsystems. Linux already has support for most hardware 
architectures. Ubuntu were able to turn around and port the complete stack of 
their offering inside a few months (weeks?). Try moving the whole windows 
ecosystem like that.<br>
<br>
Yes, any 3rd party commercial vendor needs to go 
through the same pain in porting their proprietary app on either platform, its 
just that until vendors move their wares, Windows on ARM or any other hardware 
platform (without drivers or apps) is patently useless. Linux can very quickly 
move the whole stack, kernel, drivers and OSS apps; and be useful relatively 
quickly.<br>
<br>
MS does have a strnglinbg grip on the desktop PC market. 
Problem is, in this brave new world of alternate devices, as soon as a new 
hardware platform emerges, Linux will be far better able to fill the niche 
quickly than the lumbering beast of Redmond. 30 years after the nimble 
Microsoft outmanouvered the lumbering big blue, the tables have turned, and 
Microsoft are now the elephant in the living room.</p>

<br>
Because your so stupid 
to know that you are being hacked. The only machine that is safe from hacking 
and trojan are those machine that are turned off. Even one of the safest OS 
(openbsd) in the planet have vulnerabilities. Are Linux bigots so stupid to 
understand this? NO DAMN OS IN THE PLANET IS HACKER PROOF ANYTHING CAN BE 
HACKED.<br>
<br>
And to the retard that says &quot;To the twats arguing that 
WindowsCE on ARM = Windows portability&quot;, I did not say it means 
portability, I just corrected Mr. Timdor when he erroneously bragged that 
windows don't support ARM.<br>
<br>
Let me end this with this statement. If 
your grandparents (you can training them now) have started using Linux then you 
are right, that MS needs to be very afraid of Linux, if that's not happening 
yet then shut your mouth and get a life.<br>

<p>Microsoft isn't afraid of either Apple or Linux because Apple can't support 
the enterprise and remain Apple, and Linux went Ubuntu blind and you don't ever 
hear anything pertaining to Linux except the desktop.<br>
<br>
 Microsoft was 
terrified of Linux to point of a FUD website, threatening to sue businesses for 
IP infringement and bribing...er investing in Linux companies.<br>
<br>
 During 
the Vista fiasco Microsoft had record revenue because their server product line 
was exhibiting double digit growth, while the client services, Windows desktop, 
showed a -8% shrink.<br>
<br>
 It's puzzling all the buzz from the Linux 
community centered on fighting for scrapes with Apple while Microsoft was 
filling in holes with products like SharePoint and Dynamics.<br>
<br>
Microsoft 
isn't going to like losing the OEM license money from Mac sales but virtually 
every computer sold without OSX has a Microsoft license. It took Microsoft 
about 10 minutes to blow past Linux as the majority OS on Netbooks.<br>
<br>
 
While Penguinistas are wasting time and effort with paranoid conspiracy 
theories and ignoring the simple fact consumers stick with what they know. 
Retailers would be fine selling machines with Linux pre-installed but if 
customers even know what it is, they think it it's for geeks or have been 
seeing a couple of years of rabid Linux advocates leaving strange comments in 
forums and threads that are virulent anti-Redmond and have almost nothing to do 
with with the subject. The person helping them is likely the same.<br>
<br>
 If 
Apple can triple it's marketshare during Vista with a $1,000+ entry fee while 
Linux barely moved the needle, it's pretty easy to draw the conclusion the 
current strategy won't work.<br>
<br>
 People won't use what they never see. 
This fiscal environment should have CEOs and CIOs and CFOs slapping in Linux 
Servers like crazy. People should be using Linux as a corporate desktop which 
has little in the way of issues a consumer desktop poses. It would smooth the 
way for consumer acceptance.<br>
<br>
 Windows 7 is going to slam shut whatever 
slim chance this current strategy window had for success. Don't sneer at GUI 
server management and belittle those MCSEs who use it because they have never 
used anything else.<br>
<br>
Stop all the stupid Microsoft slamming. The guy 
who sees 50 machines in his section, is checking out DVDs, giving info at the 
dentist and basically seeing almost every transaction done on a Windows PC 
isn't buying it. You only become a marginalized and your message ignored.<br>

<br>It's time for the Linux community to growup. Trying to change behavior of 
the user community like it's a child you want to stay in bed by a boogy man 
Microsoft under the bed is a failure.<br>

<p>Just to be clear about one thing. WindowsCE is not proof of Windows 
portability to ARM. WindowsCE is not the same operating system as the Windows 
NT series. It's a completely different operating system that happens to be made 
by the same company and gets called by a similar name. The code is not the 
same; the APIs are not the same. Linux is closer to being the same operating 
system as MacOS than WindowsCE is to being the same operating system as Windows 
7 (or any other member of the NT series).</p>

<p>I like the simple fact that there is nothing new in these posts from posts 
8 years ago. Linux has undoubtably moved on and so has windows. Windows biggest 
comeptitor is windows, thats what keeps them awake at night in redmond. Did you 
know SQL runs on RH, not that it will ever see the light of day. I know i used 
to work there. Vista was a huge blow for MS, a lot hangs on win7 and Linux will 
play its part but its XP that win7 has to eat.</p>

<p>Man, some of these comment's...<br>
<br>
The old security canard &quot;no 
OS is completely safe, so therefore Windows security doesn't suck&quot;<br>
<br>
That's like saying since no building can stop every thief your shitty apartment 
with a $15 deadbolt is as secure as Fort Knox.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I think somebody 
actually managed to break into Fort Knox once, just once. I can still get in 
your shitty apartment with a hammer, good luck trying that with Fort Knox.<br>

<br>Next up, &quot;MS isn't afraid of Linux teh own the software world, Apple 
has more market share than Linux&quot;.<br>
<br>
Linux's primary distribution 
method is not through retail channels, it's count is under reported. The last 
five people I switched to Ubuntu are counted as Windows users because that is 
what came on their machines at purchase.<br>
<br>
The truth is MS *is* afraid 
of Linux/FOSS, according to their own quotes. Quotes by Gates, quotes by other 
members of the MS executive team, quotes stretching back almost a decade.<br>

<br>Linux server shipments have been growing at a faster rate than Windows for 
several years now. Linux's share of the total server market is growing faster 
than Windows, both at the expense of Unix.<br>
<br>
You see what MS is afraid 
of is they need people to buy Win7 and Office whatever-the-latest version-is. 
These two items account for about 60% of their annual revenue. To run Win7 
pretty much requires a new(ish) computer and they mean to end-of-life XP to 
force you to move (so they can get paid). If your choice is new machine and 
Win7 or switch to a Mac (and replace all your apps with a Mac version), well 
the new machine/Win7 upgrade is _both_ cheaper and more familiar. But with 
Linux in the equation switching to Linux on your current hardware is the 
cheapest of all, it only takes time.<br>
<br>
MS got to be where they are by 
being the cheapest, their whole company was built on it. They know how 
devastating an advantage price is. Their software was rarely the best but 
always cheaper than the competition.<br>
<br>
The only firewall they have 
against Linux is awareness/familiarity. Sure some folks might know of all three 
choices, Windows, Mac and Linux and still choose Windows for some reason (maybe 
Games or CAD work or business accounting) but the majority of the windows 
computers/users don't fall in those categories. The majority of users had 
Windows chosen for them by virtue of MS's (now failing) strangle hold on OEMs 
and their conscious choice to *not* by a Mac, generally based on price.<br>
<br>
MS knows they cant beat Linux/FOSS on price or quality, they can't buy out the 
underlying software that OSS companies are based on. They are facing a slow 
bleed to a awareness tipping point then their monopoly is lost. What happens 
when MS pushes for the next round of upgrade cash and the average consumer has 
become aware of an alternative that is as easy to use as OSX and the cheapest 
of all, free. Their monopoly starts bleeding from every socket, just like IE is 
doing to Firefox.<br>
<br>
Ubuntu is rapidly approaching OSX's ease of use and 
they are desperately trying to halt the growing awareness of Linux/FOSS.</p>

<p>Err, I meant to say that, &quot;Linux is closer to being the same operating 
system as OS X (not the old MacOS) than WindowsCE is to being the same 
operating system as Windows 7 (or any other member of the NT series).&quot;<br>

<p>6. Openness<br>
<br>
Knowledge is power, and a only Microsoft knows what's 
inside Windows, meaning only Microsoft knows what windows can and can't do. 
Linux is open, so its capabilities are known and new features can be added, old 
ones removed. You don't have that option with a proprietary OS, only the 
manufacturer does...</p>

<p>There are a few misconceptions in TFA. GNU/Linux passed MacOS in popularity 
around 2003/4. You can check Apple's unit production in their SEC filings. M$'s 
own numbers show GNU/Linux at abut twice the rate of MacOS. That is scary for 
M$. In their own figures unlicensed copies of their own software are still a 
large concern. That loyal customers prefer their 8 year old product over 
current production is the biggest concern IMHO. M$ is a dinosaur whose brain 
has not gotten the message that they are in the tar pit. They have nowhere to 
go but down.</p>

<p>Even though I am wasting my time I will respond once again to anonymous.<br>
<br>1. As has already been stated by others Windows CE is completely different 
from Windows XP or Windows 7. Linux is portable and scalable. That means Linux 
can run on anything from a dedicated appliance to a supercomputer. That you 
would mention Windows CE as proof of Windows portability proves that you know 
even less about computers than I do.<br>
<br>
2. I live in Chicago. I have no 
idea why you bring up rural banks. That someone like me, with no training in IT 
other than one class 27 years ago can install and run Linux, that non 
professionals like my wife can use linux, that kids from my neighborhood, which 
is far from a wealthy neighborhood can use Linux more than proves that Linux is 
quite useable. Regarding penetration of desktop market, only one of the 3 
computers we own were purchased with Linux on it. None of them currently run 
Windows, yet based on how statistics regarding OS use seem to be gathered, 2 
out of 3 computers in my household are Windows computers. Based on my own 
experience and what I have read elsewhere, Linux use on the desktop is 
underreported.<br>
<br>
3. Your original point seemed to be that malware is not 
a problem on more recent versions of Windows. I cited cornficker to demonstrate 
that even the most recent version of Windows has security problems which Linux 
users do not have to deal with. I'm glad there are fixes for corficker. I'm 
even happier that as a Linux user, I don't have to worry about finding 
solutions to such problems. Why? Linux is more secure than even the most recent 
versions of Windows.<br>
<br>
4. I won't repeat my previous post. However in 
response to your statement about compiling programs -- I am an elementary 
school teacher. Why should I waste time compiling programs when the programs I 
want to use are available for free from secure repositories? I open up my 
package manager, search for what I want in the search box, click on it, click 
on apply, and wait for the program to install itself.<br>
<br>
5. In response 
to &quot;Now this is FUD, you can suck my windows ASS. Sour graping loser.&quot;
<br>I am currently writing this after dismissing my 5th grade students from 
summer school. Congratulations on displaying less maturity than these 11 year 
olds. The only reason I can see for you giving such an immature response is 
because you realize that any Windows machine can easily become a virus and worm 
infected spambot unless up to date antivirus and antimalware programs are 
constantly running in the background. I have been using Linux for 4 years now. 
Never have I had to worry about malware while running this OS.</p>

<p>Some more observations on why Microsoft should be scared. Sorry in advance 
for the length of this post.<br>
<br>
I use Linux for a variety of reasons such 
as it's security, cost, and stability. More importantly, I use it because the 
philosophy underlying Linux is very similar to my philosophy as an educator. 
Linux was started in a university setting. In a university, as well as at an 
elementary school, knowledge is something to be shared, not horded.<br>
<br>
As 
an elementary school teacher, my job is help my students become as autonomous 
as possible and to cooperate with each other, to be problem solvers and active 
learners, and to move beyound passive dependency. Linux gets developed by a 
community of people who are willing solve problems and share not just their 
solutions, but how their solutions work. That means I as a computer user have 
the opportunity to not just use these software solutions, but to learn how 
these solutions work. On my Linux run computer, I can dig into any file of any 
program and learn how that program works. I can even make any changes I want. 
What this means is that as a computer user, I can put into practice what I try 
to teach my students to do in the classroom. As a teacher, I help my students 
to become more free as individuals. Linux helps me to become more free as a 
computer user.<br>
<br>
Microsoft's practices are the antithesis of this 
philosophy of freedom. With them, knowledge is to be horded not shared. 
Information is locked into closed proprietary formats. Solutions are sold, not 
shared. Those with knowledge have to sign nondisclosure agreements. Software is 
not shared, not even sold, but licensed. Software can be installed on the 
user's computer without the user's knowledge. The list can go on and on. 
Microsoft's business model is founded upon the notion that those using its 
products are to be nothing more than passive consumers of its products. 
Microsoft has every reason to be scared of Linux. Linux undermines the very 
foundations of its business model.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this observation is that it's based on an 
individuals experience on a particular OS popularity or OS usability. It might 
be that Linux is popular on some areas while in some other parts of the world 
it's not. Even if it's popular a lot of people have different preferences on 
what they conceive easy and difficult to use. People learn things differently. 
In short we have our own biases. Some people will like Linux and some people 
will always prefer using Windows or Mac (believe it or not I did see a company 
that are still using windows 98).<br>
<br>
Part of the reason why MS will still 
survive even with the growing popularity of Linux is that a lot of big 
companies uses windows for internal and external operations, the rise of .NET 
related jobs is certainly a good indicator of this trend. If big companies are 
looking for these professionals, universities will have no choice but to offer 
curriculums that are MS technology related, this will again ensure the future 
of the windows platform. If this will not change then i think MS have no reason 
to be scared at all.</p>

<p>I think this is delicious, the picture in this article is from a slide 
being presented by Ballmer at a shareholder meeting. The graph showing OS 
market share percentages has the same size wedge for Linux as there is for OSX, 
same size wedge = same size market share.<br>
<br>
I had been reading about MS 
thinking Linus's share was on par with OSX, nice to finally find an example.<br>

<p>Great article! I look forward to seeing more like it to come. The truth is 
that Linux is slowly becoming more known, which is putting a dent in 
Microsoft's profits. Microsoft has become accustomed to having little to no 
competition the past decade, now they are getting a little. This is good. I 
just hope more people realize the MANY benefits of open source software, 
compared to closed source. I've seen so many closed source applications that 
are garbage, and cost way more than what they should. Open source isn't 
available for everything, but what is out there is great stuff. Just the fact 
that there is no licensing tracking involved in open source alone is huge.<br>

<p>I've been using Ubuntu Linux since 2005 with Breezy Badger. My response to 
the Windows/Linux flamewar is always the same:<br>
<br>
No one really *uses* 
Windows or Linux. What we use is software these two platforms provide.<br>
<br>

As a Linux user should I now discourage the use of Windows? Hmm. If an 
interested party asks whether s/he should switch, I always ask: &quot;Why are 
you interested? Do you have a lot of Windows software?&quot; The results are 
various.<br>
<br>
If the answer is: &quot;Word, Excel, browsing, e-mail, 
photos, torrenting, movies, instant messaging, etc.&quot; then I see the 
perfect candidate to begin explaining why Linux would be a superior platform.
<br><br>
However, rather than tossing them into the Linux swimming pool, I let 
them wade in by replacing their corrent PROPRIETARY software with FOSS 
variants. They learn to live with things like: No more pimping of their Instant 
Messenger clients, etc. Once they settle into FOSS products, switching the O/S 
behind these products is the next step.<br>
<br>
If the owner says they use 
CorelDRAW, PhotoShop: software they paid good money for, then I suggest an 
alternative: boot to Win to work these, but keep Win off the net, boot to Lin 
to surf, etc. Then create a FAT32 partition to share files between both systems.
<br><br>
I'm sure some trolls will say: &quot;I *use* my O/S&quot; to counter 
argue me. My point remains the same: the *average* user, that notorious 
&quot;Joe Sixpack&quot; gets frustrated when his PC slows to a crawl. That's 
the best time to compare his glorious Windows box with my set up: faster boot 
time, similar software choices, better menu organization, etc.<br>
<br>
Cuz, in 
the end... it's not whether Windows or Linux wins or who fears who, but it's 
about which system provides the best possible service to the user. Crossing 
your arms, turning up your nose and demanding that the O/S *you* use is the 
best is often a sure sign of hidden insecurity. I am quite comfortable with 
whatever choice my customers make. And there's nothing quite so influential as 
a PC technician who's Linux savvy: far more effective that a Penguinista or a 
Windows Troll.</p>
