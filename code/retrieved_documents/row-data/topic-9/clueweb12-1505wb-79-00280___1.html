<p>Learn How To Install Software In Linux and Unix Distros</p> 
<p>By Eddison Sherry</p> 
<p>For a Linux enthusiast there are a variety of distributions (distros) or 
otherwise called flavors available in the internet. These distros vary mostly 
in the package management system they use to install software and also in their 
philosophy. Although the basis is same, it is the differences in handling the 
power that the kernel (Core program of the operating system) delivers that 
makes them distinct from each other. A newbie can easily get confused with the 
concepts in Linux, thanks to Microsoft which serves as an introductory course 
to using a computer the way you want it. In this article we will check what all 
options are catered for a normal user in installing software.</p> 
<p>Mainly the distros can be categorized on the basis of package management 
system into three viz, .rpm based (redhat package manager), .deb based and the 
source based. The first category.rpm has its basis on Red Hat operating system 
or extensive usage of their code. openSUSE, fedora, Mandriva are a few to 
mention in this class.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The next class is.deb or Debian based distros. Multitude of distros are 
available in this too most prominent one being Ubuntu.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The third category uses the source code for its primary operations Gentoo 
linux being one among them. Many distros provide additional front end programs 
to make it easier for the user to add or remove libraries or software&rsquo;s 
to the system which may be either GUI based or command based.</p> 
<p>Now we will have a look at a few conceptually best package managers used by 
the distros. Red Hat has Yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified) package manager for 
the convenience of the user. It was originally developed to manage Red Hat 
Linux systems at Duke University&rsquo;s Physics department.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu has the synaptic package manager which uses the underlying 
apt(Advanced Packaging Tool) to gather and install software. Gentoo uses 
portage as its software installer but is a bit different in behavior from other 
package managers in that it deals with source code and compiles and installs 
for the specific machine on which it is running. These package managers install 
software from any recorded media like CD or DVD or from internet servers called 
repositories maintained by distributions and communities associated with its 
development. All these software managers resolve dependencies between packages 
while installing a software or library. Dependencies arise when a software 
might be compatible with a particular implementation of a library file where as 
another software we are trying to install might need a different underlying 
implementation of the same concept. When the two such conflicting 
software&rsquo;s needs to coexist then the library file preferences need to be 
sorted out. Software&rsquo;s usually depend on many libraries and hence the 
automatic management of dependencies is a welcome move as far as the huge Linux 
users community across the globe is considered as it would alleviate the 
problems in managing the system.</p> 
<p>There is ample scope if you are a nerd or a geek to have your own way of 
tweaking the system and this is what fancies the computer addicts to use this 
powerful operating system. To conclude let us assume that the competition in 
the field gives rise to wonderful Linux based operating systems easily 
manageable and gives a new dimension to computing capabilities of the new 
generation.</p> 
<p>Eddison Sherry had been working in Linux and other Unix flavours for long 
years. He had been writing blogs and article on the Linux Storage,Linux Commands
 and Linux Server Administration. If you are working on Linux or Unix Server 
its best to have a look on his blogs atLinux Technical Forum.</p>  Tags: debian,

<h2>Evolution of GNU, Linux System &ndash; Must Read For Newbies</h2>  Monday, 
November 7th, 2011 |Arizona Linux | 1 Comment <br>
<br>

<p>By Raghu Bharadwaj</p> 
<p>I would like to introduce you to a chronology of events that happened in 
the early 80&prime;s and 90&prime;s.</p> 
<p>Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project</p> 
<p>For Richard Stallman things started to look bad with the collapse of the 
free community at the Artificial Intelligence lab at MIT in the early 
80&prime;s, with modern era operating systems, none of them free software, were 
coming with a nondisclosure agreement which said, you are not allowed to share 
or change the software and if you want to get something changed, ask us to do 
it for you.</p> 
<p>This sounded anti-social to the software-sharing community that had existed 
for many years at the MIT, who enjoyed and agreed sharing their programs with 
universities and companies. And to see or to change the source code of an 
unfamiliar program to create a new one was quite common.</p> 
<p>After losing his community, Stallman always had the choice of joining the 
proprietary software world, writing code under nondisclosure agreements, which 
he believed divided the software society and a means for not helping a fellow 
hacker (&ldquo;Someone who loves to program and enjoys being clever about 
it&rdquo;) or quitting the computer field, which was rather an unpleasant thing 
to do as it would have wasted his skills as an operating system developer. 
Other way round was to build the community back by writing free programs again.
</p> 
<p><strong>GNU Project</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now the idea was pretty clear, what was needed first is an operating 
system. With a free operating system, a community of cooperating hackers would 
be able to use a computer without starting to deprive his or her friend. He 
chose to make the system compatible with UNIX so that it would be portable, and 
UNIX users could easily switch to it. The name GNU was chosen for the project 
following a hacker tradition, as a recursive acronym for &ldquo;GNU&rsquo;s Not 
Unix&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>The GNU project started with an objective to create a &ldquo;free 
software&rdquo; society, here the term &ldquo;free&rdquo; is often 
misunderstood and it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom. It is 
defined as:</p> 
<p><strong>&raquo;</strong>You have the freedom to run the program, for any 
purpose.</p> 
<p>&raquo;You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To 
make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source 
code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is 
exceedingly difficult.)</p> 
<p>&raquo;You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a 
fee.</p> 
<p>&raquo;You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, 
so that the community can benefit from your improvements.</p> 
<p>After quitting his job at MIT in 1984 Stallman began writing the GNU 
software. First he began by writing a compiler from scratch, which is now 
popularly known as GCC and the GNU Emacs editor for writing and editing his 
programs.</p> 
<p><strong>Free Software Foundation</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As users of Emacs were growing, more people were getting involved in the 
GNU project, and this forced Stallman to look for some funding. So in 1985 the 
Free Software Foundation (FSF) was created, a tax-exempt charity for free 
software development. Since then Free Software Foundation employees have 
written and maintained a number of GNU software packages, two notable ones are 
the C library and the shell.</p> 
<p>Gradually more and more programs were added to the GNU system and most of 
them gained popularity as they could run on the Unix systems, and users began 
extending them and porting them to the various incompatible versions of Unix, 
and sometimes to other systems as well.</p> 
<p>By 1990 the GNU system was almost complete, with a major missing link, the 
kernel, which actually does the job of managing the system resources. The 
decision was to implement the kernel as a collection of server processes 
running on top of Mach, a microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University 
and then at the University of Utah. This kernel named the GNU HURD (or 
&ldquo;herd of gnus&rdquo;) could run on top of Mach, and do the various jobs 
of the UNIX kernel.</p> 
<p><strong>GNU/Linux System</strong></p> 
<p>In 1991, a student from Finland named Linus Torvalds developed a 
Unix-compatible kernel and called it Linux. And around1992, combining Linux 
with the not-quite-complete GNU system resulted in a complete free operating 
system, the GNU/Linux system. It is due to Linux that a version of the GNU 
system could be run today.</p> 
<p><strong>GPL (GNU General Public License)</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>All the software under the GNU project were distributed under the GPL, 
which says that you can copy and distribute exact copies of the program&rsquo;s 
source code as you have received it. You can make changes or modify the program 
and again redistribute under the first mentioned condition, with clear notices 
of your changes and date of that change.</p> 
<p><strong>Linux Distributions</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Many Linux distributions based on the GNU/Linux system are currently 
available both as free copies and commercial distributions. Most of these 
distributors add up their own features, targeting specific areas like 
Enterprise, Desktop, Multimedia etc., to the existing GNU system, to cater 
diverse user sections. Some noted ones are RedHat, Fedora (an open project by 
RedHat), Debian, Suse from Novell, Mandriva, Ubuntu, Sabayon, PCLinuxOS, 
SimplyMEPIS, Knoppix, Gentoo etc. All these distributions intend to target 
different set of users. So you, now have the options of choosing the 
distribution based on your intended use, like suse, ubuntu, PCLinuxOS for user 
friendliness, debian, fedora for development, RedHat for Enterprise and so on. 
Least to say programming would be delightful on all of them.</p> 
<p><strong>Where do I get Linux?</strong></p> 
<p>Most of the Linux distributions are freely available for download from the 
Internet;</p> 
<p>Fedora from download.fedora.redhat.com</p> 
<p>Suse from novell.com</p> 
<p>Debian from debian.org</p> 
<p>There are also other links from where you can pull down these 
distributions. And if you do not want to waste time downloading, buy them from 
people like OSDisc.com, LinuxCD.org etc., but I am sure you would definitely 
find one, among your colleagues.</p>  Tags: FOSS, Free Software Foundation, GNU,

<p>Linux Training and Red Hat Certification</p> 
<p>By John Kol Marsh</p> 
<p>In today&rsquo;s competitive IT world, knowledge of Linux can help shape 
the future of a person. Apart from knowledge in languages such as Java, 
C++,.net, PHP, knowledge of Linux can help in securing a very good career. 
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds. The source code of Linux which is called 
the Kernel is available for free on the internet. Anyone can download and 
develop it in a unique way. Many companies have already released their own 
versions of Linux. This makes it a very unique operating system. Every version 
of Linux is different from the other in one way or the other.</p> 
<p>Linux is one of the preferred operating systems for corporate houses.</p> 
<p>&middot; One of the greatest advantages of using it is because it&rsquo;s 
swift in multitasking. It is very stable in terms of crashing and rebooting. 
Many other operating systems have to be rebooted from time to time to run 
efficiently.</p> 
<p>&middot; As it is a free-operating system, the bugs are fixed within a very 
short span of time. If a bug is reported, many people will offer solution to 
the problem like a community based approach.</p> 
<p>&middot; It is secured operating system because of the fact that it is 
virus-free. This is because it does not recognize or run the virus or worms.</p>
<p>This makes it a perfect operating system for corporate and databases.</p> 
<p>Linux training can help in gaining sufficient knowledge about Linux. It is 
different from the most popular operating system like Microsoft Windows. There 
are many variations in Linux and one of the most popular versions is Red Hat 
Linux.</p> 
<p>In order that a person needs to fully understand and operate a Linux based 
system, he or she needs to have required knowledge and training. Red Hat 
Certification or RHCE Certification is the certificate which is given to those 
expert users who get through the Red Hat Training and Examinations. Red Hat 
Training includes Red Hat Essentials, System Administration, Security &amp; 
Networking Administration, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Virtualization.</p> 
<p>Now the question of which professional institute to choose arises. There 
are plenty of institutes that provide Red Hat Linux. But, one of the best 
Corporate Linux Training provider is Zonix Systems. Zonix systems has scaled up 
to the position of a leading Linux Corporate Training providers within a short

<h2>Linux Flash Drive</h2>  Sunday, April 3rd, 2011 | Learn Linux - Linux help 
|No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Linux Flash Drive</p> 
<p>By Betty Rims</p> 
<p>A Linux Flash Drive is an external hardware bootable device which can be 
used to install Linux OS into the host controller which is generally a PC. 
Linux is a multi-tasking operating system which is considered to be far more
sophisticated &amp; secured than any other operating system available in the 
market. It can be loaded into a USB drive in order to explore its advanced 
features. All you need is a bootable USB drive to pack the Linux OS and then 
install it in your computer to be used for multi-tasking, maintenances &amp; 
other data recovering purposes. You can also load only the required kernel 
embedded operations into the flash drive and install it across a network.</p> 
<p>It is impossible to modify &amp; recover the data from a live CD which has 
been permanently written. But by using Linux Flash Drive, this impossible task 
is made possible like modifying permanently written files and recovering the 
data as well. So, it increases the flexibility &amp; becomes easier for the 
Linux users to have their required applications, configuration etc. to get 
stored &amp; securely saved in a live USB as an extended storage device.</p> 
<p>There are two major different ways to run Linux in an USB flash drive. The 
first is to use Linux flash disk and the second is to use a drive as a full 
Linux install. The first method is considered to be the better way &amp; is 
widely used by the users. In order to get executed all the operations, a Linux 
flash drive has to maintain a minimum requirement of 1 GB flash USB such as the 
latest Linux based OSs: Ubuntu, Fedora need 1 GB of free storage so that it can 
be run and made changes in a live USB.</p> 
<p>The following are the advantages and disadvantages for Linux Flash Drive:
</p> 
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p> 
<p>It is portable &amp; flexible as you can get all your required 
applications, files with you wherever &amp; whenever you move as it is host 
independent as well as cross platform.</p> 
<p>Almost all the computer systems in the World can maintain booting right 
from a live USB flash drive no matter it is a desktop, server or any small 
computer system. All you need is to hook up your Linux flash drive into your 
host controller and start enjoying its high end advanced features.</p> 
<p>A Linux flash drives maintains security with hardware authentications and 
it also supports to share a single system among multiple users.</p> 
<p>For the users who perform data back-ups regularly, Linux flash drive can 
back up your important files easily &amp; securely. It can save you from 
accidental file damage without painful efforts.</p> 
<p>It offers faster data copying than any optical devices and you can transfer 
your important data between remote computers without FTP utilities.</p> 
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p> 
<p>A Linux live USB can support a limited number of storage space &amp; 
written data which is comparatively much lower than local hard drives.</p> 
<p>It is typically not a good idea to store an operating system temporally in 
a flash drive rather than storing the system files in the main RAM of your 
computer.</p> 
<p>Linux flash drive is generally for advanced users &amp; experts as it is a 
little harder to install and more difficult to handle than other operating 
systems like Windows, Macs etc. So, it is not suited for common users.</p> 
<p>Linux is a free and open source operating system. So most of the time Linux 
flash drives are illegally pirated.</p> 
<p>As the device is small, most of the time it is reported to be misplaced and 
stolen. Therefore, reliability is comparatively lower and sensitive OS files 
are not recommended to store.</p>

<br>

<p>Linux Backup Software &ndash; Choosing Among the Best</p> 
<p>By Jes B</p> 
<p>Today, Linux is one of the well known operating systems that are widely 
used by a lot of people. Its backup software is also the best seller among all 
their products. In using this product, you need to be technically knowledgeable 
especiallyin Unix. When you buy Linux backup software, there is a warning that 
you need a background on Unix which is an important thing to consider. If you 
are not that proficient in this area, select a package that is not the 
technical. You can find one that works well with windows. If you are confused 
with the terms, it is good to consult a computer specialist when it comes to 
this matter.</p> 
<p>You can also find Linux backup software in the internet. This could be 
downloaded for free. However its features are limited. In case, you don&rsquo;t 
know, it is a good idea to do some research before searching for Linux backup 
software. In this way, you would know certain features of the program that is 
right for your computer system. Comparing different applications would help you 
in selecting the right software. There are a lot of benefits of having this 
program installed in your computer. There is no need for USB sticks that are 
vulnerable to virus.</p> 
<p>It is inevitable that computer can crash anytime and because of this having 
Linux backup software installed can give you a peace of mind. If you look into 
the market, there is a wide variety of choices that you can choose from. Here 
are a number of things to watch out for.</p> 
<p><strong>User friendly</strong></p> 
<p>There are different kinds of back up software available in the market 
today. Make sure that you go for the one that is user friendly. You need to 
choose the one that is not hard to figure out. It means that you don&rsquo;t 
have to be a computer genius when you try to install and use it. This software 
should be basic enough like trying to put files in folders. It needs to be 
saved automatically. Make sure that you can back up different files ranging 
from documents, video, music and photos.</p> 
<p><strong>Cost effective</strong></p> 
<p>The price of the software can vary based on the dealer. It is a good idea 
if you can find the cheapest on with large memory. There are also different 
plans that you can choose from. You can pay monthly or yearly. Remember that 
there are some that are unlimited plans that you can choose from.</p> 
<p><strong>Security</strong></p> 
<p>Make sure that you check on security of the software. This can help you in 
preventing hackers from opening the program. With Linux, you can be sure of the 
security of the software.</p> 
<p><strong>Tech support</strong></p> 
<p>In case there is something that goes wrong with the program, make sure that 
there is always a customer service that could assist you anytime that you need 
it. Check if there is both email and phone support. It is nice to know that 
there is always someone to answer your questions.</p>

<h2>Why Linux Is Better Than Windows OS</h2>  Wednesday, March 9th, 2011 |

<p>Why Linux Is Better Than Windows OS<br>
 By Eve Wilson</p> 
<p>Are you tired with your Windows operating system? Is the OS infected by 
viruses and there are security issues as well? Well, you are not alone; there 
are many Windows users who are not satisfied with this operating system. 
Microsoft Windows might be the most popular operating system in the market but 
there are a number of flaws. On the other hand, Linux, a less popular system, 
is much better in terms offering hassle-free computing experience. To get 
Windows OS you need to pay a hefty amount while Linux is absolutely free. In 
this article you will find why Linux is a better choice than Microsoft Windows.
</p> 
<p>More of the complaints we get regarding Windows PC is about virus 
infection. You cannot use a Windows machine without antivirus or anti-malware. 
Even after having these programs installed there is still the risk of getting 
infected. Sometimes, viruses and malware even get past the best solutions. On 
the other hand, with Linux, you don&rsquo;t need to worry at all about this. 
Your PC will hardly get infected with viruses with this operating system.</p> 
<p>Windows PC users also experience mysterious slowdowns. The reason behind 
this shut down could be diverse. It might be due to viruses, malware, 
fragmentation, or any other operating system issues. You will never experience 
these types of abnormal behavior from on a Linux computer. Not only the 
operating system but also you will hardly face mysterious application crashes 
with Linux.</p> 
<p>Troubleshooting on Linux computer is very easy as you can go through the 
/var/log to find out what is ailing your PC. If you are not well familiar with 
the command line, you can install a GUI. This will allow you to scan through 
the log files and check for the issues and fix it. You can also run a backtrace 
to get all of the debugging information for the applications that you are 
facing problem with. Then you can fix the issues on your own or contact an 
Operating system support provider for Linux support.</p> 
<p>Another most important thing is resource. To run a Windows 7 desktop your 
computer must have minimum 1 GB of RAM. Anything less than that makes your 
computer appear like it is working on slow motion. With Linux system you will 
never face this type of problem. Linux requires very less amount of hardware 
resources. This OS make the use of RAM to cache files until the cached files 
goes above the amount of RAM available on the computer. On the other hand, 
Windows 7 OS uses memory for cache only for the cases if there is no other

<p>Top 3 Reasons To Switch To Linux<br>
 By Aditya Rayaprolu</p> 
<p>A lot of people have heard about Linux, and how good it is. But they have 
also heard how<em>difficult </em>it is. Five years ago, if someone said that 
Linux is still not ready to be used by the average PC user,then there would 
have been a good reason to justify that statement, because no form of Linux was 
really user-friendly back then. But today, the picture has changed entirely. 
Many distributions of Linux have dedicated their development to make it easier 
for the average user to get used to the Linux environment, and the interface 
has become very user-friendly. Here are three quick reasons why you should 
immediately switch to Linux, and say goodbye to Windows!</p> 
<p>1. Security:</p> 
<p>Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which is very famous for its 
built-in security features that make it difficult for someone to break into the 
system. The Linux kernel improves some of these features, and the result is a 
robust operating system that cannot be harmed by some of the most common 
viruses and malware present on the Internet. Linux is so secure that one can 
try to execute a virus-ridden file and still get away with it, because the 
virus would simply not work under Linux!</p> 
<p>2. Speed:</p> 
<p>Any Windows user would know that if a lot of programs are installed under 
Windows, the computer becomes slow and unresponsive after a period of time, and 
the user needs to defragment the hard disk in order to gain speed again. Linux 
doesn&rsquo;t have these issues, and maintains a constant speed at all times, 
simply because its file system does not allow the computer to slow down at any 
moment. The speed of the computer will only depend on the hardware 
configuration, and no matter how many programs are installed under Linux, the 
speed won&rsquo;t be affected.</p> 
<p>3.Cost:</p> 
<p>This is perhaps the biggest advantage of using Linux. It is completely <em>
free</em>! Except for the commercial Linux distributions like Red Hat, the 
other distributions are entirely free of cost, and can be downloaded and 
modified at the user&rsquo;s will. This is in contrast with the heavy pricing 
Microsoft puts on its Windows operating system, which is very weak against the 
various threats on the Internet.</p> 
<p>So if you haven&rsquo;t yet switched to Linux, you seriously need to 
consider pondering about these three reasons, and you&rsquo;ll soon be 
wondering why you didn&rsquo;t make the switch before!</p>
