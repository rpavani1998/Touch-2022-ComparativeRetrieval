<p>2011 Best Linux Distributions</p> 
<p>By Judith Ceja</p> 
<p>Which Linux distribution is right for you? There is no one right answer 
because it depends on your experience and specific needs. Listed below are the 
top seven Linux operating systems for 2011. Each program was ranked based on 
ease of installation, user-friendliness, and amount of support available.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions for desktops. New 
versions are released about every six months. This program is easy to install 
and use. The ample support comes from both technical professionals as well as 
end users. Ubuntu is a great program for beginners</p> 
<p>Mandriva originally appeared to be a restructured version of Red Hat Linux. 
The current software has added user-friendly features including better hardware 
detection and intuitive disk partitioning. Mandriva also utilizes a KDE desktop 
and has great support which makes it a good program for beginners.</p> 
<p>PCLinuxOS is great for new Linux users due to its intuitive graphical 
installer. It provides users with current desktop software and fast boot times. 
This program received our lowest rating for support because it does not provide 
support in any language other than English. Additionally, the program is only 
available in a 32-bit version and new releases are not scheduled regularly.</p> 
<p>Gentoo was designed for power users, allowing them to have ultimate 
customization capabilities. It also has exceptional security. One of its best 
features is the ability to keep the system current without re-installing the 
software. However, long compilation times and occasionally instability makes it 
less of a crowd pleaser than other available software.</p> 
<p>OpenSUSE has an extensive and intuitive configuration tool. The program 
also includes user-friendly desktop environments (GNOME and KDE). The program 
gets high marks for help and support. However, its heavy use of resources for 
desktop setup and graphical utilities tend to slow the program down.</p> 
<p>Debian GNU/Linux supports more infrastructures than any other Linux 
distribution program and contains more than 20,000 software packages. It has 
become the largest Linux distribution ever created and has inspired over 120 
Debian-based distributions. The program has a reputation for stability and 
being the most bug-free Linux distribution system on the market. However, their 
intensive testing has led to lengthy intervals between releases, typically 1-3 
years.</p> 
<p>FreeBSD was introduced into the market in 1993. The program is not in the 
same league as the other programs listed. However, it is fast, stable and has 
over 15,000 software applications available. FreeBSD lacks a graphical 
installer and the convenient features of hardware detection and system 
configuration which must be performed manually by the user.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, you must choose the program that is right for you. Ubuntu and 
PCLinuxOS enable beginners to use Linux without requiring a steep learning 
curve to produce results. Gentoo and FreeBSD are definitely for more advanced 
users. Mandriva, Debian GNU/Linux, and openSUSE are the best programs if you 
are willing to trade some advanced features for stability and continuing 
support.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of the Major Operating Systems</h2>  Monday, February 15th, 
2010 |Learn Linux - Linux help | 10 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Pros and Cons of the Major Operating Systems</p> 
<p>By Dean Walden</p> 
<p>There are several options when it comes to choosing an operating system for 
your computer. Of course Windows is the overwhelming heavyweight in the market 
place and it isn&rsquo;t a bad choice in some ways, especially for those not 
interested in the nuts and bolts of things. Also looking for users are Linux, 
BSD and Leopard.</p> 
<h3>1. Windows</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The good side of Windows is that it is made to operate programs. The rich 
variety of software that works here is a huge selling point. You don&rsquo;t 
have to be a programmer or even a techie to be a user. Everything comes from a 
disc or a download. Click the install button and away you go. Word processors, 
Spreadsheets, Games, Synthesizers, Photo Editors, Art Creators, Email Handlers, 
Bookkeepers and Website Makers are some of the most common. Then there are the 
not so popular yet also intriguing out of the mainstream volumes such as File 
Converters, Iso File Makers, Virus Hunters, Adware Killers and endless 
utilities you may discover once you start looking. There is a small utility 
that saves clips (as many as you want) that can be pasted anywhere so you 
don&rsquo;t have to retype all the time.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the good side of Windows. Just so you know it&rsquo;s not all 
roses and candlelight you should know there are some drawbacks too. Everything 
you do on Windows should be backed up regularly. Why? Because just about the 
time your five week project is within a few paragraphs of completion, Windows 
will have a hiccup and lose the whole thing or some virus will erase your hard 
drive, or you&rsquo;ll press the delete button accidentally. Boom, it&rsquo;s 
all toast. Another thing about Windows is that it&rsquo;s already programmed, 
you have to accept it as it is. If it doesn&rsquo;t have a feature you need, 
you&rsquo;re out of luck. If the button arrangement is not convenient (although 
there is some flexibility), you must adapt. Don&rsquo;t need all the bells and 
whistles? Your stuck with them. Then there are the slow days when it all just 
seems to sit there and mock you taking it&rsquo;s sweet time. It&rsquo;s no 
wonder someone occasionally tosses one out the 10th story window.</p> 
<h3>2. Leopard</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>So, what are the other options? Well, first is Leopard which is the 
Macintosh operating system. Macintosh is made by Apple Computers. If you 
don&rsquo;t know who Steve Jobs is, you must live in a dark and deprived world. 
Macs, as they are known, cost a little more than others systems (about twice 
the price of a Windows machine). I will tell you right here that I have yet to 
meet a Mac user that has a bad word to say about his or her machine. If you get 
one, you are practically guaranteed to love it. They are the choice of graphic 
artists almost universally. The local ad sheet for the city is made on them, so 
they make commercially viable tools.</p> 
<p>The negative side. Not a lot really. There isn&rsquo;t as much software 
made for them, but the ones you get are extremely well made. A lot of the less 
popular stuff doesn&rsquo;t exist for Macs. That along with the higher price 
are the main hitches.</p> 
<h3>3. Linux</h3> 
<p>Another option is Linux. The Linux operating system is actually free at 
this time so the price is right. There are many flavors (versions) of Linux, so 
you don&rsquo;t have to use the same thing everyone else has.</p> 
<p>Some that I know of are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Red Hat</li> 
<li>Ubuntu</li> 
<li>Suse</li> 
<li>Damn Small</li> </ul> 
<p>Each one has advantages and limitations because they are geared toward a 
certain area such as games or internet or servers. They have a ways to go to 
become popular, yet are making great strides in market share. Also, if you can 
do the programming, Linux offers wonderful access to the code. In the last year 
or so, it has become quite easy to obtain and install Linux on any computer. In 
fact it will coexist right alongside Windows, so now there is little excuse for 
not trying it out. They offer a GUI similar to Windows and Leopard which is 
fairly intuitive. Some software is quite comparable to the bigger fish. 
OpenOffice will take Office on and come through looking pretty good. Gimp has a 
learning curve, but can do much of what Photoshop does for free.</p> 
<p>The downside is that Linux is just not as developed. It is a terrific 
platform for geeks that love to swim through code and troubleshoot glitches. 
The creative potential is unlimited which is the main drawback at the same 
time. Most people want something ready to go, not something they have to create 
before they can operate. The number of programs (though growing) is quite 
limited.</p> 
<h3>4. BSD</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The last of our operating systems to consider is BSD. Just like Linux, it 
is free (though there is a commercial version). The major selling point is that 
it is the most modern system. It doesn&rsquo;t have the backward compatibility 
issues of Windows. So many advances in hardware have been made since windows 
was introduced that you wouldn&rsquo;t believe some of it. BSD was created to 
take advantage of these advances. It has the most potential of all these 
systems because of it&rsquo;s modern design. It is quite compatible with and 
similar to Linux, just more modern.</p> 
<p>That at the same time is it&rsquo;s largest problem. Most of the 
accessories that go with an operating system (software and interface) are 
lacking at this time. It&rsquo;s like having a Ferrari engine and framework 
without the rest of the drive train.</p> 
<p>Dean Walden is an avid internet user, watcher, promoter, website builder 
and researcher. The Ubuntu version of the Linux operating system is easy to use 
if you can use Windows.</p> 
<p>Someone has developed a way to install Ubuntu on a Windows machine without 
interfering with Windows. To learn how to put Ubuntu Linux alongside Windows on 
your computer (with the Wubi installer), start athttp://wubi-installer.org/<br>

 Once you have it downloaded, just start it and it will do the rest. Then the 
next time you boot up, you&rsquo;ll have the option of Windows or Ubuntu. Once 
you try Ubuntu, you can shut it down and restart to go back to Windows.</p>

<h2>Quick Overview of Bsd Systems With Main Focus on Openbsd</h2>  Tuesday,

<p>Quick Overview of Bsd Systems With Main Focus on Openbsd<br>
 By Juraj Sipos
</p> 
<p><em> Most users who use Linux use it because they hate Microsoft; people 
who use BSD use it because they love Unix</em></p> 
<p><strong>History</strong></p> 
<p>To say it metaphorically, the Internet sprung out of BSD. It is not because 
these systems can handle the biggest traffic as servers, but because the 
concept of IP addresses and the TCP/IP stack is a BSD invention. If you right 
click on the file &ldquo;winsock.dll&rdquo; in Windows 98 
(C:Windowswinsock.dll), you will see &ldquo;BSD Socket API for Windows&rdquo; 
in the Properties &gt; Version window; however, the &ldquo;BSD&rdquo; is not 
seen in newer Windows systems in the &ldquo;version information&rdquo; window 
of winsock.dll. But there is a lot of writing on the Internet about this if you 
Google both terms: &ldquo;winsock.dll&rdquo; AND &ldquo;bsd&rdquo;. BSD systems 
have a different licensing policy and anybody can take their code. BSD license 
gives more freedom to programmers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>From the above it is clear that Microsoft, too, used or &ldquo;stole&rdquo; 
this code, not only Linux. BSD grew up in the 1970&prime;s with a Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) support. Version 4.3 BSD (1986), 4.3 
BSD Tahoe (1988), BSD Net 1 (1989), and so on followed. The history is well 
described also on BSD sites. FreeBSD, for example, started as a project in 1993 
shortly after NetBSD; and OpenBSD is a fork of NetBSD, but these all are 
derived from 386/BSD.</p> 
<p><strong>Linux versus BSD</strong></p> 
<p>BSD: BSD systems are based upon an actual Unix variant called Berkeley 
Software Distribution, which has a long history.</p> 
<p>Linux: Linux is based upon a clone of Unix (Minix), which was far away in 
functionality in comparison to the above Unix at its time. Terminologically 
speaking, Linux is only the kernel.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;Linux-versus-BSD&rdquo; discussion is very sensitive for some 
people &ndash; they may get very angry about any direction, either in favor of 
BSD or Linux. It is not a good idea to compare these systems as the whole, but 
it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to compare their &ldquo;usability&rdquo; in various 
aspects, for example, as an &ldquo;office solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;desktop 
solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;multimedia solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;server 
solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;firewall solution&rdquo;, etc.</p> 
<p>The widespread use of Linux helped some users switch to BSD for good, as 
various opinions made the issue of &ldquo;Linux-versus-BSD&rdquo; visible to 
public eyes, which made the BSD world appear more attractive.</p> 
<p>If we talk in general, we can say that &ldquo;BSD is much more stable, as 
it is a REAL Unix&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Linux is a very good desktop toy more 
adapted to users&rsquo; needs, as it has more drivers and apps&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Other global aspect that makes Linux and BSD systems look different is that 
BSD OS&rsquo;s have everything under one hood and control. Linux is murky 
waters because it is not united. For example, you have a DEB (Debian Linux) 
package &ndash; you will not always install it if you use Mandrake or SuSE. A 
long list of problems ensuing from discrepancies among Linux distros may be 
written. Linux users surely remember the effort of UnitedLinux, but now it is 
devoid of life. In the chaos where one Linux system installs with various 
services and the other one does not, we see that the Linux community is broken 
as the whole.</p> 
<p>Linux is more developed in terms of its accessibility to various types of 
hardware like, for example, inkjet printers or WiFi USB solutions. But this is 
because, as I already said, various companies support it. Linux is good for 
desktop users who want to forget about Microsoft and BSD systems are best as 
server/router/firewall solutions. Many good administrators say that Linux 
behaves much worse as server than BSD systems. Something like Red Hat or SuSE 
Enterprise Server is rather a joke &ndash; these systems cost a lot of money. 
Every good administrator would only bet on BSD or other Internet solutions 
today. Slackware Linux is exception &ndash; it is one of the best.</p> 
<p>There are many reasons why BSD systems are less noticeable. The 
availability of Live CD&rsquo;s and their easy-to-use presentation is something 
in which BSD systems lagged behind. You may download Linux ISO images at the 
drop of a hat. With BSD systems, this is a bit different. You could hardly find 
a desired BSD Live CD in the 1990&prime;s. Only a few of them do appear now.</p>
<p><strong>OpenBSD</strong></p> 
<p>I tackled the problem of building such a CD myself. I toiled with FreeBSD. 
I succeeded. Later I focused on OpenBSD, as it has a good reputation concerning 
its solid security structure. I succeeded too. But this would require 
additional writing and this article is not about making an OpenBSD Live CD; I 
only want to introduce this system a little and give advice how to make a 
simple OpenBSD bootable installation CD/DVD, which is also hard to get.</p> 
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p> 
<p>BSD systems work well with all kinds of standard hardware; however, some 
users say they are &ldquo;less user-friendly&rdquo;. On the other hand, others 
consider the so-called &ldquo;user-friendliness&rdquo; to be a hindrance in 
making needed configurations. In other systems, where many services run 
automatically, it is a bit irritating when administrators, with their own 
security policies in mind, must turn them off on a regular basis after every 
installation.</p> 
<p>OpenBSD could be, from a Linux user&rsquo;s point of view, a can of worms. 
Some may disagree with me, but in the world where all mainstream operating 
systems bet on easiness-to-use and the graphical interactivity, this is surely 
the case. This means you must forget about graphical installers &ndash; your 
first touch with the system is the text mode. But the text is the best format 
some people like.</p> 
<p>OpenBSD can run Linux binaries on an emulation layer; DOS (and other 
systems) programs within the Qemu emulator, as well as FreeBSD and other BSD 
and Unix binaries. Albeit OpenOffice.org has not been ported yet (do you really 
need such a big bulk of software when there are more handy solutions?), you can 
easily write or open your MS Word documents in TextMaker for Linux, or in 
native OpenBSD AbiWord port.</p> 
<p><strong>The system and packages</strong></p> 
<p>The BSD family of operating systems consists of the base system and 
packages. The OpenBSD core &ndash; its kernel and the base system 
(system/network utilities, man pages, etc.) get cautiously, if not paranoically 
audited for security holes.</p> 
<p>The OS has a different packaging philosophy in comparison to Linux. It uses 
ports and prebuilt packages. Ports are fingerprints of applications on your 
disk. They contain the basic information where they can be downloaded from. You 
just &ldquo;cd&rdquo; somewhere to the hierarchy of the /usr/share/ports 
directory, where applications are divided by categories; then type &ldquo;make 
install&rdquo; and wait for sources to be downloaded, compiled, and installed.
</p> 
<p>Prebuilt packages, too, can be installed with a breeze. Unlike RPM 
archives, which you must install in the consecutive dependency order, here you 
have everything on tap. And with the command<code>pkg_add -v ftp address and 
the package name</code> you download everything from the Internet even without 
specifying the package&rsquo;s version. This is something most Linux packagers 
cannot do, only APT (Debian) and its clones.</p> 
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p> 
<p>The policy of the OpenBSD team is to sell CD&rsquo;s. Unless you are 
prepared for a difficult network install, you have two options: either you buy 
their CD&rsquo;s, or build them yourself. If you choose the latter option, 
download the core system from these FTP mirrors:http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html
. Pick out your architecture like AMD64 or i386 and the version (like 4.0, 3.9, 
etc.). Place all downloaded files in any directory (for example, in /usr/opbsd) 
and issue the following command to make the ISO image of it:</p> 
<p>mkisofs -b cdrom40.fs -c boot.cat -R -v -o /usr/my_openbsd.iso /usr/opbsd
</p> 
<p>The above command may be used both in Linux and in BSD systems and possibly 
in any system to which mkisofs is ported.</p> 
<p>When ever in the future you are ready to download a newer version of 
OpenBSD with purpose to make a bootable CD/DVD of it, just change the 
&ldquo;cdrom40.fs&rdquo; in the above mkisofs command (4.0 is the current 
version of OpenBSD) to the version it agrees with, for example, 
&ldquo;cdrom45.fs&rdquo; (a future OpenBSD), which is a bootable image as the 
emulated big floppy. A CD or DVD burned with this ISO file will boot on any PC 
(not DVD in UDF format, but DVD in ISO format).</p> 
<p>The following files contain the basic OpenBSD installation &ndash; 
networking, Unix commands, X Window, man pages; not packages like KDE, Aspell, 
etc.</p> 
<p>OpenBSD 4.0 core systemPackages # you can create this directory and put 
packages in itCKSUM, INSTALL.i386, INSTALL.Linux, MD5, base40.tgz, bsd, bsd.mp, 
bsd.rd, cd40.iso, cdboot,cdbr, cdemu40.iso, cdrom40.fs, comp40.tgz, etc40.tgz, 
floppy40.fs, floppyB40.fs, floppyC40.fs, game40.tgz, index.txt, man40.tgz, 
misc40.tgz, pxeboot, xbase40.tgz, xetc40.tgz, xfont40.tgz, xserv40.tgz, 
xshare40.tgz</p> 
<p>It is important to say that the ISO file cannot be burned to a CD as an 
ordinary file like an MP3 file &ndash; it can be done this way, however, but 
you will not be able to boot from such a CD/DVD. If you use Windows, the proper 
way for burning ISO files is to use the &ldquo;burn image&rdquo; command in 
programs like Nero Burning ROM (or &ldquo;burn ISO&rdquo; in other programs). 
Under FreeBSD, you can burn the ISO image with the burncd command (if your 
CDROM is the master on the second IDE channel; &ldquo;-s&rdquo; is for speed):
</p> 
<p>burncd -f /dev/acd0 -s 4 data my_openbsd.iso fixate</p> 
<p>It would be a good idea to make the bootable OpenBSD DVD with packages 
included in it &ndash; just download them and put them to a directory (for 
example, to a directory &ldquo;Packages&rdquo;) where you have your core 
OpenBSD installation files; then apply the above mkisofs command.</p> 
<p>Installation is quite easy. For newbies it is recommended to use a mobile 
rack and use some older disk (about 3 GB). This is because installing OpenBSD 
to an already partitioned disk requires a lot of knowledge and if users do not 
want to bother about numbers of sectors/cylinders and other things they must 
type in the text wizard, this solution is very handy.</p> 
<p><strong>OpenBSD in action </strong></p> 
<p>The system boots fast (much faster than Linux). If you selected the X 
Window environment during the installation text wizard, you only need to run 
the &ldquo;xorgcfg&rdquo; command from the console to configure your X Window 
environment.</p> 
<p>Did you lose yourself somewhere in the text-mode consoles? Use the F5 key 
(Ctrl+Alt+F5) to get back to the X Window. Are you a complete newbie? Type 
&ldquo;man afterboot&rdquo;. Are you accustomed to Linux and do you prefer a 
Linux terminal type? After every logon, OpenBSD asks you to type the terminal 
type you want to use, but the default one &ndash; vt220 &ndash; does not map 
keys like you got accustomed to in Linux if you use programs like Midnight 
Commander (for example, F7 behaves like F6, etc., but not in X). After typing 
&ldquo;nxterm&rdquo; everything should work OK.</p> 
<p>A manual text-mode configuration is the absolute preference here. Almost 
all services are turned off &ndash; a first choice for every good 
administrator, as he will have ultimate control over the whole system. Users, 
too, may familiarize themselves with Unix and see what is going on under its 
hood. To run the X Window, just execute the &ldquo;startx&rdquo; command. If 
you want to edit or re-edit the configuration files, peep into the /etc 
directory with vi as your editor. Do you want to add more packages? Just 
download them and issue &ldquo;pkg_add -i package.tgz&rdquo; command and 
that&rsquo;s it!</p> 
<p>OpenBSD 4.0 is geared up for most of the network or desktop tasks. After I 
downloaded some fine MP3 players, I could instantly listen to music. The X 
Window&rsquo;s look does not differ from any Unix-like box. VLC or MPlayer 
multimedia players will help you enjoy all your favorite music or film 
recordings.</p> 
<p>If you have euphoria from seeing the KDE or Gnome Desktop and other apps 
running smoothly, you may soon become disappointed &ndash; OpenBSD has fewer 
packages than FreeBSD or Linux. For example, running VMware on FreeBSD has been 
possible for quite a long time; OpenBSD (but not OpenBSD in the VMware 
environment) requires some smart tweaks to achieve this.</p> 
<p><strong>New technologies and automation can also impose a risk</strong></p> 
<p>Numerous companies want to earn the highest profit and they introduce 
various technologies that serve as a marketing competition strategy for most of 
the time and are often useless. A bluetooth or WiFi technology in your mobile 
phone brings a security risk when any good hacker can get to your most 
sensitive data within seconds right from your neighborhood. Most users do not 
have time to study various security datasheets and they often live happy 
without knowing they are unprotected. I do not want to say that newer 
technologies are always nonsensical; however, they deserve pertinent praise 
only if used on the right place.</p> 
<p>If a reader understands this, the mainstream world&rsquo;s policy is to 
create the Matrix or a big web of dependencies &ndash; if hardware can run in 
Linux, users use Linux (and possibly buy Red Hat or Xandros).</p> 
<p>Numerous &ldquo;terrific&rdquo; companies that sell their &ldquo;amazing 
security products&rdquo; forget that using carrier pigeons for communication is 
by far a more secure solution than any computer communication &ndash; an 
encrypted e-mail, if you are already under suspicion, will always get 
intercepted, and governments have always enough resources and money to do their 
job well.</p> 
<p><strong>Why BSD or OpenBSD?</strong></p> 
<p>Today, when too many companies bring out various distros, it is hard to 
tell which of them best suits our needs and you may become mixed-up in such a 
huge list. If companies invest money to a software solution, they may become 
disappointed if its licensing policy changes. OpenBSD has one sturdy feature 
above everything &ndash; the system and packages are perfectly audited for 
security holes.</p> 
<p>The power of a good policy will make you feel somewhat sheltered from the 
bad behavior of the world, because you do not have to worry that network 
services, for example, contain security holes. Something like this often 
happens with Linux &ndash; its websites urge users to download important 
patches soon after distros are released. With this particular security point 
OpenBSD as a BSD system stands aside from the usual crowd.</p>

<h2>Battle of the Hosting Platforms &ndash; Windows Vs Linux Vs Mac</h2>

<br>

<p>Battle of the Hosting Platforms &ndash; Windows Vs Linux Vs Mac<br>
 By 
Justin Knights</p> 
<p>Having a web hosting company to host your website is a common thing among 
webmasters nowadays. The question is which type of platform should you choose? 
Should you choose the Windows, Linux or Mac? Let&rsquo;s compare them to see 
which stands out in the comparison.</p> 
<p>The first thing that users compare is the price. Linux is known to be the 
most affordable among the three platforms. Theother 2 are more expensive 
because of the licensing issues because they are owned by Microsoft and Apple. 
So, by being an open source system, Linux can be obtained without having to pay 
for anything. Many users turn to Linux because of this reason.</p> 
<p>Another sought after feature is the stability of the platform. Again, Linux 
is known as the most stable platform and is the most suitable to be use as a 
hosting solution. The BSD system used by Mac is build base form the Unix 
system. One of the earliest platform types around. This also makes Max a very 
stable hosting option. As for the Windows, they are less stable and often have 
problems such as blue screens, freeze and crash. However, Microsoft has made a 
lot progress throughout the years. Nevertheless, Linux is still the one to turn 
to when it comes to stability.</p> 
<p>Then there is the need to be user friendly. For this, operating platforms 
need to be simply and easy to use. To be able to use a Linux operating 
platform, you will need to be equipped with some technical skills because it 
uses commands similar to DOS systems. Therefore, Linux is more difficult to 
operate if compared to Windows or Mac. This is because the other 2 systems are 
using graphical interfaces and this is usually more user friendly. This 
interface will mostly require users to click and choose according to the 
administration process displayed on the screen.</p> 
<p>So, based on the history of the industry, Linux has been the longest 
platform around but the other 2 systems also has a deep background. The Mac 
hosting is becoming more popular due to its solid application depending on the 
scenario. No matter what, all 3 choices could serve you well as long as you are 
using it for your website. If you are in need of your own server, you will have 
to choose wisely. In conclusion, with a small price, you can have a good 
quality platform to operate your website on.</p> 
<p><strong>A last piece of advice</strong></p> 
<p>Web hosting is a topic that every business owner and web developer has to 
deal with. I am sure that most of us have been pretty frustrated with shady web 
hosts and biased hosting reviews. There are sites however, who are dedicated to 
reviewing and providing information about different web hosts.</p> 
<p>TopWebHostReview.net for example, is one of those quality websites that 
provide nothing buthonest web hosting reviews. If you are one of those who 
needs guidance in term of website hosting, make sure you don&rsquo;t miss the 
website. I am sure their unbiased hosting reviews, (for example this one:FatCow 
Review) will be very helpful.</p>

<p>Milestones in the creation of Linux</p> 
<p>+1960s No one can argue that with the introduction of Unix in the 1960s we 
would not have Linux today. It was originally developed by AT&amp;T employees 
at Bell Labs</p> 
<p>History of UNIX systems</p> 
<p>+1983 The GNU project was started with the purpose of creating a free UNIX 
style operating system consisting of free and open source software (FOSS)</p> 
<p>+1980s BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) was a free operating system 
project developed from AT&amp;T&rsquo;s 6th edition of Unix.</p> 
<p>+1991 Linus Torvalds realized his terminal emulator based on Minix was 
turning into an operating system, and this was the makings of today&rsquo;s 
Linux kernel</p> 
<p>Linus Torvalds</p> 
<p>+1992 Linus suggested releasing the kernel under the GNU General Public 
License. He first announced this decision in the release notes of version 0.12. 
In the middle of December 1992 he published version 0.99 using the GNU GPL.</p> 
<p>Linux and GNU developers worked to integrate GNU components with Linux to 
make a fully-functional and free operating system. Torvalds has stated, 
&ldquo;making Linux GPL&rsquo;d was definitely the best thing I ever did.&rdquo;
