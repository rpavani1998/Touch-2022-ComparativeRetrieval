<h1>OS X Is Holding Back the Mac</h1> 
<p>Dan Knight - 2005.12.14 - Tip Jar</p> 
<p>Popularity: </p> 
<p>The personal computing world is divided into three major camps: Windows, 
Linux, and Macintosh. Windows accounts for about 90% of the installed base. 
Macs and Linux divide the remaining 10% or so between them.</p> 
<p>Why don't Linux and the Mac OS account for a greater share of the market?
</p> 
<p>Conformity. Image. Marketing. People use Windows because everyone uses it, 
because it's seen as the &quot;business&quot; OS (thanks to IBM's adoption of 
Microsoft DOS way back in 1981), and because Microsoft, Intel, and dozens of 
hardware companies are pushing it.</p> 
<p>Macs are seen as nonconformist computers. Different hardware. A different 
OS that hasn't always played well with Windows. Something only creative types 
use, according to the stereotype.</p> 
<p>Linux users form another counterculture, one more technically inclined. 
They debate distributions, GUIs (Gnome vs. KDE), and hardware. They know that 
OS&nbsp;X should have been built on a Linux foundation - and they think Linux 
is accessible to the masses.</p> 
<p>They're wrong.</p> 
<p>I've done four Linux installations in my life. One was on my 10 GB iPod, 
and while it was interesting for a few days, it was troublesome in the long 
run. Another was on myPower Mac G4/1 GHz dual. And that's where this story 
begins.</p> 
<h3>Ubuntu Linux for PPC</h3> 
<p>Step one is picking a Linux distribution, and I'd heard good things about 
Ubuntu. So I downloaded a disk image (ISO) file and used DragonBurn to create a 
bootable installation CD. Then I booted from the CD and tried to install Linux.
</p> 
<p>I have a 250 GB drive inside this computer, but I didn't want to risk the 
installer messing up my configuration. I had a pair of 80 GB drives in an 
external FireWire enclosure. First problem: How do I know which of the two 
drives to partition for Linux? I had files on one, nothing on the other, but 
the installer didn't identify the drives by name.</p> 
<p>I picked the wrong one - oh well. The installer did its thing, partitioning 
the drive and then installing Linux on my external drive. Theoretically I'd be 
able to boot both my eMac and my Power Mac from the same disk.</p> 
<p><i>Theoretically,</i> because after installing Ubuntu Linux, I discovered 
that you can't boot it from a FireWire drive. I did a lot of online research, 
and that's a pretty consistent message.</p> 
<p>If Ubuntu Linux won't boot from an external drive, why does it allow you to 
install to an external drive?</p> 
<p>Strike one.</p> 
<p>Yellow Dog Linux is supposed to work with a FireWire drive, and I may try 
that someday. It also means downloading four disk images and burning four 
install CDs.</p> 
<h3>Ubuntu Linux for x86</h3> 
<p>Leaman Crews suggested I try installing Ubuntu on my Acer Aspire laptop. 
The 40 GB drive came partitioned with a small first partition and two 17 GB 
partitions. I don't understand the reasoning behind that, although perhaps 
Windows is considered so problematic that it's best to have a backup partition.
</p> 
<p>Once again I downloaded an ISO file and burned a bootable installer CD. 
Then I diddled around trying to figure out how to boot the Acer from a CD. Mac 
users don't know how easy we have it being able to just hold the C key and boot 
from a CD or DVD.</p> 
<p>I finally discovered that you have to press F2 during startup and configure 
the laptop to look at the Combo drive before trying to boot from the hard 
drive. Nothing intuitive about how to change that either - but that's not a 
reflection on Linux.</p> 
<p>It was really cool watching the Acer boot into Linux, and then I discovered 
the first problem: The installer assumes a 24- or 25-line by 80 character 
display, yet the widescreen display on the Acer was maybe 18 or 20 lines by 80 
characters. That meant there were several lines of text that I couldn't see.</p>
<p>Tip to the folks at Ubuntu: Create an installer that works with widescreen 
laptops. Use a smaller font so we can see 24 or 25 lines like people with 
regular displays.</p> 
<p>Being unable to see what I was selecting meant that I spent a lot of time 
going in circles, but I eventually got Ubuntu installed and running on the 
Acer. It was neat to see - but also fuzzy. Somehow it hadn't detected the 1280 
x 800 native resolution of my display, so it was scaling 1024 x 768 to full 
screen. Kinda fuzzy.</p> 
<p>Strike two.</p> 
<h3>Ubuntu Redux</h3> 
<p>I searched online for a way to rerun just the part of the installer that 
handled video drivers, but I couldn't find anything. I did find a few pages 
explaining how to go into the terminal and type in cryptic commands that had to 
be entered just so and varied for each and every graphics processor out there.
</p> 
<p>Not for me. Linux is supposed to be user-friendly these days. I don't want 
to use the terminal with Linux any more than I want to use it on OS&nbsp;X or 
use DOS on a Windows computer.</p> 
<p>In the end I concluded that I'd have to run the installer again and do a 
complete installation. Ubuntu wanted to repartition my Linux partition into a 
system partition and a scratch partition, somehow ignoring the fact that my 
previous installation had already created a scratch partition.</p> 
<p>I eventually worked around that problem by simply removing both of those 
partitions and having the installer create them from scratch. That took some 
time, because I was making blind choices with text that didn't appear on my 
widescreen display.</p> 
<p>This time when it came to configuring video, I understood that you use the 
tab and arrow keys to move the cursor and the space bar to toggle resolutions 
on and off. I picked just the 1280 x 800 native resolution, and in the end I 
had a sharp display.</p> 
<h3>How Friendly Is Linux?</h3> 
<p>Ubuntu installs all sorts of useful applications - Firefox, chat and email 
software, an Office suite, several games. It's a bit different from what a Mac 
user is used to, but not too divergent from the Windows experience. I'd say 
Ubuntu is definitely less pretty than OS&nbsp;X or Windows, but every bit as 
usable.</p> 
<p>I fiddled around. I played. I installed other browsers. I configure the 
messaging client. And then I tried to install things that hadn't come with the 
distribution. That's when I discovered that while<i>using</i> Linux may be as 
simple as Windows, installing software isn't.</p> 
<p>The more I use Opera, the more I like it, but I couldn't get it installed. 
Not a big deal, since I had three other browsers, but not a good sign. Why 
can't Linux software have the same kind of simple installers Mac and Windows 
users are accustomed to?</p> 
<p>Next I decided to see how well Linux handled Yahoo Games. The various 
browsers were kind enough to make it easy to install Flash when a website 
needed it, but Yahoo Games require Java - and Sun doesn't have a simple 
installer for Linux, and the Java that comes with Ubuntu Linux wasn't 
recognized by Yahoo.</p> 
<p>I looked over the step-by-step instructions and tried to follow them in the 
terminal, but for whatever reason I couldn't get Java installed.</p> 
<p>Strike three.</p> 
<h3>Room for Improvement</h3> 
<p>What was all this nonsense about Linux being user-friendly and accessible 
to the masses? I'll grant that once it's installed, it's probably as easy to 
use as Windows (which I, as a Mac user, find pretty cryptic), and I can 
definitely make my way around in it.</p> 
<p>But what's up with installers that let you put the OS on a drive you can't 
boot from? Or not being able to add a resolution for your display if you 
botched your installation? Or not being able to easily install something as 
important as Java?</p> 
<h3>The Macintel Future</h3> 
<p>We live in a three OS, two hardware platform world, but that's going to 
start changing in 2006. Apple will begin migrating Macs to Intel CPUs, and the 
new &quot;Macintel&quot; computers will be able to run Windows, Linux x86, and 
Mac OS&nbsp;X.</p> 
<p>Windows does a lot of things right, but the underlying operating system is 
so full of holes it makes Swiss cheese look solid. Linux does a lot of things 
right, but there are still those geeky things that require you to use the 
terminal.</p> 
<p>Mac OS X does almost everything right. It's so secure that not a single 
virus has survived in the wild. Every program written for OS&nbsp;X (as opposed 
to ported from Linux or Unix) installs easily. The underlying kernel is a bit 
of a hack, ported from NeXT's x86-based OS to the PowerPC, and moving the Mac 
to Intel CPUs will improve things.</p> 
<p>The question is how the future will play out. Linux is already broken into 
many camps - KDE aficionados vs. Gnome users, Debian vs. Slackware vs. Gentoo 
plus dozens of other distributions. But the core of Linux is solid, powerful, 
efficient, and doesn't get as bogged down with multithreading as the Mac OS.</p>
<p>In many ways, OS X is what Linux would be with a great GUI. Likewise, Linux 
is in some ways what OS&nbsp;X could be. For all its strengths, OS&nbsp;X does 
allow tasks to so dominate the OS that everything else stops while the beach 
ball spins.</p> 
<h3>Apple + Intel + Linux</h3> 
<p>It was once unthinkable that Apple would switch to Intel CPUs, but Apple's 
engineers with NeXT roots have been developing OS&nbsp;X (then called OpenStep) 
on Intel hardware longer than they have on PowerPC.</p> 
<p>When Steve Jobs started NeXT, he soon realized that no existing OS matched 
his vision and determined that the Mach kernel (a variant of Unix) would be the 
best foundation for his new object-oriented operating system. That was 1986, 
and the NeXT computers ran their Unix-derived OS on Motorola 68030 CPUs - the 
same used in Macs.</p> 
<p>In 1991, Linus Torvalds began writing the Linux kernel, a Unix-like 
operating system designed for the popular, powerful Intel 80386 CPU. The first 
version of Linux was released in Sept. 1991, and since then programmers around 
the world have contributed to extending and improving Linux. This is arguably 
the most extensive and successful open source project to date.</p> 
<p>By 1992 NeXT has begun porting NeXTstep to Intel CPUs, and there was 
another project to port it to PowerPC. However, that project was halted when 
NeXTstep 3.1 (a.k.a. NeXTstep 486) was released in 1993.</p> 
<p>NeXT's next project was separating the rest of the operating system from 
the kernel, which helped create OpenStep.</p> 
<p>NeXT was committed to the Mach kernel five years before Linus Torvalds 
began his OS, and it took a while before Linux began to approach the maturity 
of other Unix-like operating systems, so there would have been no reason for 
NeXT to consider switching from Mach.</p> 
<p>In the 14 years since the first Linux release, Linux has grown into a 
full-fledged operating system that has been tweaked and optimized by a host of 
programmers - and their work reviewed by other programmers. In fact, Linux is 
so robust that IBM has embraced it.</p> 
<p>Now let's put the pieces together. NeXT already learned how to put their 
interface on both Mach and Solaris kernels. Linux has grown into the most 
popular non-Microsoft operating system on x86 hardware, but it's held back by 
dozens of distributions and two different GUIs.</p> 
<h3>Mach: OS X's Achilles' Heel</h3> 
<p>What if Apple were to build the equivalent of OpenStep for Linux? That is, 
take the whole of OS&nbsp;X and build it around a Linux kernel instead of Mach. 
(This would be the exact opposite of MkLinux, Apple's project to build a 
PowerPC version of Linux on the Mach microkernel that Apple abandoned after 
they acquired NeXT.)</p> 
<p>The problem with Mach is that microkernels are inefficient because of all 
the communication taking place between different parts of the operating system. 
A monolithic kernel is more efficient because processes don't have to move in 
and out of the kernel.The current Wikipedia article puts it thus:</p> 
<p>Microkernels generally underperform in comparison to traditional designs, 
sometimes dramatically. This is due in large part to the overhead of moving in 
and out of the kernel, a context switch, in order to move data between the 
various applications and servers. It was originally believed that careful 
tuning could reduce this overhead dramatically, but by the mid-90s most 
researchers had given up.</p> 
<p>It seems sensible to move OS X to a more efficient kernel than Mach (Apple 
has been making Mach more efficient since 10.0 shipped), but there's one big 
obstacle: Avie Tevanian, one of the developers of the Mach kernel, worked at 
NeXT and came to Apple with Steve Jobs. Egos and personalities seem to mean a 
lot at Apple these days, so unless Tevanian were to become convinced that 
microkernel architecture is hampering OS&nbsp;X and then convince Jobs of that 
truth, change is unlikely.</p> 
<p>We can dream, can't we? Dreams of the best kernel and the best GUI working 
together. An OS and installers that are truly ready for the masses. No more 
beach balls of death. Real competition for Microsoft Windows present and future.
</p> 
<p>The transition to Intel would be the perfect time to make the switch. </p>
