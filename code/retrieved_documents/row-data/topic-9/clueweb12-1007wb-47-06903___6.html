Born a day after the American Independence in 
<b>Jalandhar, Punjab, India</b>, I've spent most part of my life there. Studied 
till 5th standard in<b>St. Joseph's Convent School, Jalandhar</b>, and later 
had to join<b>Apeejay School, Jalandhar</b> as, perhaps, the former school 
decided boys could be troublesome in a girls' school after 5th. After 
completing schooling in APJ (till 12th), joined<b>National Institute of 
Technology</b> [NITJ] (again, in Jalandhar) as a Computer Science &amp; 
Engineering student in 2005. During the worst period of downtime (recession), 
got an on-campus placement inAccenture in 2008. Graduating from college took 
another year after that, and finally joined Accenture in mid-2009. This is my 
story so far... Btw, you can find me at:facebook twitter last.fm digg

<h2>TestDisk &mdash; A life saver</h2> Blogging, Rants No Comments &raquo; <br>
<p></p> 
<p>TestDisk</p> <br>
 Turning on your computer one not-so-fine day just to 
discover an entire partition (drive on harddisk) gone is nothing short of a 
nightmare potent enough to give you a mild heart attack. Unfortunately, exactly 
that happened to me yesterday.
<p></p> 
<p>An ardent distro hopper that I am, I recently installed (K)Ubuntu 11.10 on 
my laptop. Things were all fine for 4 days until I fixed a startup issue with 
my Windows installation using its DVD. The issue was temporarily fixed and I 
was able to log into Windows. But the next time I booted into Linux, my Windows 
partition was no longer being shown in the file manager. I fired up 
&ldquo;fdisk -l&rdquo; just to find out that the Windows partition had been 
overwritten by another hidden 2GB FAT partition, which was now being shown as a 
twin duplicate of the original. It didn&rsquo;t take me much time to realize 
that the Windows DVD had screwed up my partition table, making the whole 80GB 
Windows partition disappear!</p> 
<p>After some research, I found this excellent opensource partition recovery 
tool by the nameTestDisk. Thanks to its Linux version, I was able to find the 
lost Windows partition, recover it and write the updated partition table to the 
harddisk. Although it&rsquo;s a command-line application, believe me, 
it&rsquo;s damn straight-forward, and as simple as any other GUI thing.</p> 
<p>(God forbid) In case, some day, you find yourself with a partition or two 
gone from your harddisk, give TestDisk a try. Highly recommended.</p> <br>

<h2>Why Switch? Dual-boot!</h2> linux, open-source No Comments &raquo; <br>

<br> 
<p>I keep hearing people say, &ldquo;I am happy with my Windows; don&rsquo;t 
want to switch to an alien OS such as Linux.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Hey, this Linux 
thing looks cool. But I do not want to switch over to it suddenly (or at all) 
because my Windows just works.&rdquo; Even, &ldquo;I would really like to 
switch over to Linux, but don&rsquo;t know how hard it is to make that shift 
(replacing Windows or dual-booting). And my X-Y-Z app works in Windows, and 
I&rsquo;ve heard it doesn&rsquo;t in Linux.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><em>Rubbish! Have you ever even tried to know that there existed such a 
thing as dual-booting? And how easy it is to set up dual-booting?</em></p> 
<p>I have also heard promoters of Linux say, &ldquo;Now that you know of all 
the benefits of Linux, it&rsquo;s time you make the switch to it from your 
existing OS (Windows).&rdquo; And, &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s holding you back, 
just make the switch today.&rdquo; Some even go to such extremes, &ldquo;You 
know, you are wasting your precious money on this crap OS (Windows), which 
first drains all your money and then keeps on crashing. Switch to Linux today, 
it&rsquo;s free!&rdquo;</p> 
<p><em>Rubbish, again! You cannot force Linux down people&rsquo;s throat just 
because of your own reasons.</em></p> 
<p>Has anyone noticed how we use the word &ldquo;switch&rdquo; so often? Why 
do we have to *switch* to another OS just to try it out, or because someone 
told us to, or because it&rsquo;s free, or because&hellip; whatever?</p> 
<p>Actually, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; To use (or try) Linux, there is 
always the nice option of<strong>dual-booting</strong> (yep, that&rsquo;s the 
word) Windows with Linux. Or better yet, using Linux on a live CD/DVD/USB (or 
if you are a geek, you can try Linux through virtualization as well). This way, 
you&rsquo;ll get a feel of the incredible OS Linux is, and on the same time not 
lose access to your favorite (it-just-works) OS (Windows).</p> 
<p>That, actually, is the best first step to *switch* from Windows to Linux, 
if you really decide to later. And, not to mention, this is the best way to 
encourage users to use Linux.</p> 
<p>After all, we cannot ignore the fact that despite getting competition from 
Linux and Mac since long, Windows still holds the largest piece of market share 
pie. So the current situation rather kind of demands having to<strong>dual-boot
</strong> along with Windows, instead of instantly switching.</p>

<h2>In and around</h2> Blogging, Rants 1 Comment &raquo; <br>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s keeping me busy these days? It&rsquo;s <strong>office work
</strong>, of course. Working on quite a challenging and bigger project has its 
side-effects as well (working till late and missing daily fruit juice doses in 
my case). Other than that, I am enjoying the work as it has to do with web 
development, my area of interest.</p> 
<p>Being a strong advocate of <strong>open-source</strong> and <strong>Linux
</strong>, I read a lot of articles on these topics daily. And I hate when 
people use words like &ldquo;switch&rdquo;, &ldquo;migrate&rdquo;, etc. when 
referring to making the move from Windows to Linux. Why do people, who try to 
compel people to<em>switch</em> from Windows to Linux, forget that there is 
always an option called &ldquo;dualbooting&rdquo; and that Windows still has 
the astronomically largest market share? I really hope people use the word 
&ldquo;dualboot&rdquo; more when advocating the use of Linux to others. By the 
way, I am also writing an article highlighting this matter (<em>Why Switch? 
Dualboot!</em>), which I intend to share pretty soon.</p> 
<p>Talking about Linux, the latest Ubuntu release (10.4; Lucid Lynx) has been 
getting good reviews from all around. I can hardly wait to get my hands on it. 
I am planning to install it on my home PC (the one currently in use by my Dad 
and sister).</p> 
<p>Also, two of my good friends, <strong>Chandan Puggal</strong> (working at 
Aricent) and <strong>Amritpal Singh</strong> (working at Accenture) recently 
joined me in Gurgaon (my present work location). </p> 
<p>Finally, I did mention it earlier also, but it really is a frustrating life 
without a proper Internet connection. (Looking upward) God, please me my EV-DO 
back. Amen.</p> <br>

<h2>Vista &amp; Ubuntu &ndash; the similarities</h2> Blogging, fun, linux, 
windows 10 Comments &raquo; <br>

<p> <strong>VS </strong></p> 
<p>Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux &ndash; both are totally disparate entities 
and I am talking about similarities? Yup, I sure am. And I have reasons to 
believe this.</p> 
<p>Most of us know what Vista is. Vista is the latest edition to the most 
popular operating system (OS) lineup &ndash; Windows. For those who are 
unfamiliar with Ubuntu, Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux-based OS that 
is available for free.</p> 
<p>Here I discuss some of the similarities that I have noted in due course of 
my usage of both the operating systems.</p> 
<p><strong>Computer</strong><br>
 In both, the name given to the central 
access point to all the disks and partitions on a computer is 
&ldquo;Computer&rdquo;. In earlier versions of Windows, we used to know it with 
the name &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo;.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Sub-folders in user profile folder</strong><br>
 The default 
folders present in the user profile folder (or the home folder) are something 
like &ndash;<em>Documents</em>, <em>Music</em>, <em>Pictures</em>, <em>Videos
</em> &ndash; in both the OSes.</p> 
<p><strong>Graphical effects</strong><br>
 Starting from Ubuntu 7.10, both the 
OSes have given stress on providing graphical desktop effects to the end user. 
In Ubuntu, the effects are a result of Compiz Fusion software. In Vista, the 
most common and appealing effect is Flip 3D.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Creation of a new folder</strong><br>
 When a new file/folder is 
created within another folder in either of the OS, the newly created item 
rearranges itself automatically in alphabetical order with respect to the other 
items contained by the parent folder. This wasn&rsquo;t the case in earlier 
versions of Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>Renaming file</strong><br>
 When a file is renamed (by 
right-clicking and choosing &ldquo;Rename&rdquo; or by pressing F2) in either 
of OSes, only the name of the file is selected, leaving the file extension 
unselected.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Navigation strip</strong><br>
 When a folder within a folder within 
a folder (and so on&hellip;) is visited, a navigation strip appears near the 
top of the explorer/file manager window. In both the OSes, this navigation 
strip is very similar looking and a helpful aid.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Verdict</strong><br>
 Does this imply anything? Were Vista&rsquo;s 
features inspired by Ubuntu? Or Ubuntu&rsquo;s features by Vista? Or neither of 
the cases. It&rsquo;s upto you to decide. </p> 
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The similarities between Vista and Ubuntu 
are primarily because of the desktop environment used by Ubuntu &ndash; GNOME. 
So, these similarities are common between Vista and many other Linux 
distributions that use the latest version of GNOME.</p> <br>

<h2>Improved Jumbled Words Game</h2> downloads, Games, programming, python, 
Softwares 2 Comments &raquo; <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Remember the little, cute Jumbled Words Game I prepared in Python? More 
than 4 months had passed since I made it, and now it was time it got some 
makeover. So, featuring a host of new improvements, here I am making the 
improved game available for download.</p> 
<p>Installing and playing is easy. Just to remind the readers, the game is 
made in Python using the wxPython libraries for the graphical interface (GUI).
</p> 
<p>The Python source was converted into a Windows executable (.exe) using 
py2exe. An installer was made out of the executable using InnoSetup. Both are 
freely available for download and very easy to use. I&rsquo;ll come up with a 
Linux executable soon. And maybe aPython Egg?</p> 
<p><strong>Changelog:</strong><br>
 1. Words are now read from a text file<br>

 2. The words read from text file are jumbled automatically &amp; randomly<br>
 
3. Changed splash image<br>
 4. Improved font system<br>
 5. Score system<br>
 
6. Improved overall interface</p> 
<p>The various downloads are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Setup &ndash; install the game from this like any normal application 
(Windows)</li> 
<li>Zipped &ndash; just extract the zipped file and double-click on 
JumbledGUI.exe to play (Windows)</li> 
<li>Source &ndash; the source code of the game in a zipped file 
(cross-platform)</li> </ul> 
<p>I hope you like it. You may encounter bugs. If so, do let me know. Also, I 
would be happy to get some feedback from you regarding this little app. </p> 
<p><em>Credits:</em> The game was improved with suggestions and inputs from 
DaniWeb.com.</p> <br>
