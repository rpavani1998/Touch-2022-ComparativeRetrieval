<h2>Stop Using Windows, Use Linux</h2>  Posted by jun auza  On 5/03/2008 <br>

There's a world food crisis right now, as we all know it. Man's most basic need 
is low on supply but high in demand. This recent global predicament may not be 
felt that much in highly developed countries like the US and Japan, but 
developing country like ours and underdeveloped countries like most of Africa 
are struggling for survival.<br>
<br>
State leaders and legislators have plenty 
of proposed solutions with the goal of alleviating the current food shortage. 
But, most of these propositions will almost always be unrealistic and will 
likely fail in the end. To all our lawmakers, I have a suggestion that may 
sound radical to some of you --Stop using Windows, use Linux.<br>
<br>
This is 
a fact: Thousands of personal computers courtesy of the government are handed 
out each year to Philippine public schools. Every PC comes with a genuine copy 
of Windows XP and some educational CDs --Microsoft Office suite is not 
included. These computers are aimed to help the students learn the basics of 
desktop computing.<br>
<br>
An original copy of Windows XP will cost around 
$100. Imagine how much money our government could have saved if they opted for 
costless alternative like Linux. The money could have been used for other 
important projects or simply to help the needy. For our less fortunate 
fellowmen, a hundred dollars is equivalent to two months of hard-earned income.
<br> <br>
I don't have to explain why Linux is better than Windows and the many 
advantages of using Linux and other free and open source software. Just read 
some of my articles here if you want to know more. You might also want to read 
this post by a good man entitled:FOSS and Option for the Poor. However, I would 
like to answer a question that some might ask: How will the computer teachers 
teach the students if they themselves are not even familiar with Linux? Well 
let me tell you this;my wife is not technologically proficient but she has 
easily adapted to using Linux, so there's no doubt that a computer teacher can 
do the same.<br>
<br>
There are actually plenty of ways to make Linux adoption 
in this country a lot easier without having to spend big. We even have our own 
Linux distro namedBayanihan Linux that makes technical support and resources 
within our reach. If only our government leaders know how to make proper use of 
what we have, things could change.<br>
<br>
I know that my recommended solution 
if implemented cannot instantaneously solve the present crisis that we as well 
as other poor nations are experiencing. And I believe that there are still a 
lot of rational methods that could help solve this issue. However, I would like 
to insist that if we stop using Windows now and start using Linux, we could 
make a considerable difference for tomorrow.<br>

<p>Although I agree with your point, I must say that a portion of the sales of 
Microsoft Windows go to helping developing countries.<br>
<br>
With that said, 
I must add that I am not taking sides, and I simply wanted to point that out to 
help the other side. I do use different varieties of GNU/Linux from time to 
time.</p>

<p>I think a better solution would be to tell Homer Bush to get the hell outta 
Iraq and stop giving subsidies to US farmers to manufacture wheat for 
bio-fuels. Bio-fuel is fueling a massive price rise for wheat based food and 
that bloody war has led the world into recession.<br>
Oh as for Linux, yes I 
love it but would it help the world crisis? Get real, a days worth of bombs and 
bio-fuels would no doubt be worth a years worth of money saved with Linux 
adoption.</p>

<p>I'll stick with Windows XP because I prefer that all my programs actually 
work.</p>
