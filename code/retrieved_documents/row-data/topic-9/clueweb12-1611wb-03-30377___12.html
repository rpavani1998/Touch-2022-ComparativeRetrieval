<p> Curiously, this will come as a surprise to some people, but according to a 
report by the security experts at mi2g, open source post boy Linux is losing 
the security fight, big time, to Windows Server. Yep, you read that right: In 
May 2003 alone, 19,208 successful breaches worldwide were recorded against 
Linux-based corporate and government systems, while only 3,801 breaches were 
recorded against similarly-oriented Microsoft Windows Server systems. 
Percentage-wise, over 75 percent of all server-based breaches occurred on Linux 
systems during this time period, while Windows systems were responsible for 
just 15 percent of breaches. Furthermore, Windows-based systems were found to 
be far more resilient than Linux-based systems during the Iraq war months, from 
March to May 2003, the report says, a time of increased hacking activity. The 
company, which has been tracking server attacks since 1995, now oversees a 
database containing over 220,000 individual attacks and over 7000 hacker 
groups. So why are Linux servers being so easily compromised? The security 
experts say there are several main reasons: First, most Linux servers are 
improperly configured and do not come with decent default security 
configurations. Second, there isn't a coherent &quot;trustworthy 
computing&quot; initiative in the open source community. Third, because Linux 
is becoming more popular in the server world, it's a more obvious target. And 
fourth, Frank Stallone. In other words, everything I've been saying about 
Windows, Linux and security was not only true, but evolving in a wonderfully 
predictable way. Isn't it time we stopped all the bogus &quot;Windows isn't 
secure&quot; baloney when there is a far less secure competitor out there, just 
waiting to be compromised? </p> <br>

Code red, comon, it's been a while since that happened. SQL slammer? 
SQL problem, not Windows.<br>
<br>
 Windows isn't perfect, but the object based 
DACL security model implemented in NT is superior to simpler rights based model 
used in Linux.<br>
<br>
 Furthermore, MS has been working a LOT harder as of 
late to shake the security perception problem. Let me ask the Linux folks this? 
Can you enable a directory integrated certificate auto enrollment solution for 
users AND computers? Can affect 1000's of machines and users security rights, 
DACL settings and group memberships through directory integrated policies? How 
easily can opportunistic IPSec be enabled for 100's of machines in a Linux 
environment? How easily can you configure secure DDNS with BIND 9?<br>
<br>
 
You see, most Linux users, admins, etc., know nothing about the enterprise 
Windows world. They know nothing about AD. They understand nothing about NT 
internals. They think because they know IPChains or how to recompile their 
kernel, they are qualified to talk trash about the NT world. Well, I am here to 
say SHUT THE F UP. <br>

I would argue that 
most Unix/Linux people were at one point Windows admins but who became bored 
with the simplistic nature of Windows-based systems.<br>
 Yes, I'm an 
MCSE/CCNA/A+ who turned to Unix/Linux because Windows is neither interesting 
nor a secure model for computing. <br>

This is all a bit ridiculous. There are few hacks on tru 64 and unicos, but 
that doesn't make them secure by any stretch. Saying &quot;linux&quot; is 
lumping a large amount of distros together, many of which do not put security 
as a top priority. If Windows has a &quot;secure&quot; version, I've never 
heard of it. In the *nix world there are many trusted os and hardened os e.g. 
openbsd, hardened gentoo, trustix.<br>
<br>
 Linux is after all a kernel and a 
distro is merely built around it, while Windows is a complete OS.<br>
<br>
 
It's also a matter of exposure. There are simply more unix, linux and bsd 
servers exposed to the internet than windows imo. Also skript kiddies tend to 
target one os more than another. Many black hats don't even bother with windows 
exploits, while others specialize in them.<br>
<br>
 And it's not exactly the 
cream of the crop attacking these servers either. The guys with the better 
rootkits and zero day exploits aren't the ones defacing and being included in 
these statistics. Boils down to lazy admins not patching their boxes. If you're 
running some old distro and spending more on coffee than security then yes u 
will be hacked.<br>
<br>
 Anyway, I have nothing against windows other than it 
being a bit pricey, but these type of statistics are just meaningless garbage. 
Both Windows AND linux AND vms can all be hardened.<br>
<br>
 I just love all 
these paper mcse's and their surveys. At least RH requires a lab test lol.<br>

SQL Slammer an SQL 
problem? I dont think so, how come only MS SQL servers were affected by SQL 
Slammer? SQL Slammer was a MS problem so STFU.<br>
<br>
 Linux and Unix dont 
have DACL security? use Acces controll Lists (ACL, looks al lot like DACL 
probably cause MS ripped it) or somthing, their a LOTS of security 
implementations for Unix available wich are far more sophisticated then DACL. 
And how easy you can specify a policy for 100's of client pc unix? their are 
also 100's of ways of doing it with free software, you see thats the problem 
with windows theirs only one solution for a problem and if you dont like that 
solution its to bad for you. So you go look at unix performance, and unix 
security and then talk. Your comment about ipchains demonstrates how stupid you 
are, iptables is now used. <br>

I would 
have to agree with the Anonymous who was defending AD. Since you obviously dont 
know much about the SQL Slammer worm, and that it DID affect SQL, not just 
MSSQL then that sort of negates the point of your post. Look it up, and read my 
friend cause it did, one of my clients with Red Hat 8 and a Oracle9i database 
solution was taken down just like everyone else. Next time, do your research 
dude. Now Windows isnt prefect, but the guy above has a point. In 
administration it is much easier to use Windows AD to setup a network in a 
distributed solution than Linux. Simple fact. <br>

Maybe he does have a point about the distributed networks being 
easier, but windows more secure then linux, come on dont make me laugh and stop 
fooling ur selves, how come cisco routers aren't running embedded windows ce if 
windows is so secure and scalable. And why are big animation movies like final 
fantasy (SGI IRIX) and Dinosaurs (Amiga) not renderd on windows servers? I 
admit that in some casses its better to use windows solutions like exchange and 
office. But the shit on this page like: windows uber secure or The windows file 
system is soooo much faster then XFS or BFFS come on gimme a freaking 
break...... <br>

Okay, since you clearly 
didn't understand what I said in my first point, I will ask you again, how 
easily can you configure advanced security options across multiple systems in a 
large environment? The fact is, Linux security is a myth created by people who 
have an intellectual investment in propagating the myth of &quot;'nix&quot; 
superiority, just as Netware folks try do with their platform.<br>
<br>
 As for 
your comments regarding Linux ACL's versus the object based DACL system in NT 
(2k,XP,2k3), Linux uses a simple rights mask based ACL system defined by the 
file system and associated system code, not a true object based DACL system. In 
NT every system object (AD objects, file system objects, threads, processes, 
semaphores, etc.) has an ACL with a specific rights mask. Linux has NOTHING 
even approaching the object DACL model implemented in NT OS's. But again, most 
Linux users, like the rest of the unwashed masses, know nothing of NT internals 
or security.<br>
<br>
 Oh, and I was writing ?nix system code before you knew 
what a computer was, so don?t assume you have even HALF the knowledge I do. You 
want to talk bottom-half handlers and IRP?s? You know what an INT2e is how it?s 
related to functions exported by ntdll? Didn?t think so, so step off. <br>

Isn't it true that it is because of the 
&quot;object based DACL system&quot; that allows malicious programmers to 
create viruses that use escalation of priveledge attacks using the very same 
&quot;Security&quot; feature as an &quot;Exploit&quot;?<br>
<br>
 I mean come 
on, why does the system tray run as SYSTEM, when it is a visual item displayed 
in a &quot;USER&quot; context? <br>

1. No it isn't true.<br>
 2. The system tray is a UI component that is part of 
the winstation of the currently logged on user and does not run in the context 
of anything other than the user.<br>
 3. The issue you think you are referring 
to is that applications with display objects (such as a window or system tray 
icon) that are owned by an interactive process will receive input from a 
process running in another security context. This can potentially be used to 
attack a process running in a privileged context from a non privileged process. 
Potentially. The app can chose to A. examine the security context of the 
calling process and/or B. ignore the call. This is not a problem limited to 
Windows and has nothing to do with the DACL system but rather the inherent flaw 
of the message passing system used by all windowing subsystems. <br>

So... even after stealing code from SCO, 
linux still stinks to high heaven, totting up to the tune of 75% (A STAGGERING 
FIGURE) of all server based breaches worldwide!<br>
 This is in sharp contrast 
to the STRONG Windows system which were only breached 15 % of all servers 
breached.<br>
 This is even more impressive for Windows if you consider that 
the installed base for Windows is far greater than that of the porous, 
pathetic, crappy toy operating system called linux.<br>
 Plus of course there 
are far more attacks on Windows servers than any other systems on the planet; 
WITH MOST OF THE ATTACKS AGAINST WINDOWS SERVERS INITIATED, ORGANIZED AND 
CARRIED OUT BY MICROSOFT HATING, RABID, HATEFUL, LINUX FUNDAMENTALISTS AND 
FANATICS!!<br>
 Now the day of reckoning is coming for the nasty, anti-social 
linux haters.<br>
 SCI is going to force the linux thieves to regurgitate all 
the code they have been stealing from Unix over the years.<br>

Ohhh, the poooor little loonix user doesn't like

silently taking it from you fools. Not anymore. Not ONE useless Linux user or

THINK they know more than the rest of the world. Well guess what, just because 
you can recompile your kernel doesn't mean you know jack.<br>
<br>
 You OS 
sucks. It's a lousy kernel with a bunch of truly awful libs piled on top, with 
the same old cruddy mongrel mix of daemons found in half a dozen better 
implementations of 'nix. Top it all off with a truly horrendous X -window 
subsystem, a buttload of utterly craptacular window managers, each with its own 
crapalistic set of armature hour libraries and you have the making of THE MOST 
overrated OS in history that survives purely on the hype generated by the 
flaming liberal techno-weenie press and a bunch of uncompetitive companies that 
have no real answer to Wintel.<br>

 Here in the real world Linux is only 
grabbing a share of a shrinking 'nix market. It's a lousy system, and you know

Funny how the name-calling was initiated by a 
Windows person. It supports my theory that most Windows administrators are 
simpletons who know little of computer systems, network security and 
administration or much beyond the most basic of concepts in the IT world.<br>

<br> For a time I was extremely bitter at Microsoft for leading me to believe 
through their simple exams that I know much about computers and networks. Only 
after spending time in the unix/linux world did I understand that there is a 
whole other world of details happily hidden from the average MCSE in a GUI 
world populated by little check boxes and drop-down menus.<br>
<br>
 No, I?m 
not going to call names at Windows people (Except for the aforementioned 
?simpletons? comment, heh)<br>
<br>
 I would say to you people, Microsoft is 
fooling you into thinking you know a lot about the real world of computing. 
After a year of using Linux and FreeBSD I write my firewall scripts, write IDS 
(Intrusion Detection System) signatures to watch network traffic for suspicious 
traffic and have a Linux load-balanced cluster of atomic supermen.<br>
<br>
 I 
made up that last bit about atomic supermen. It?s a regular Linux cluster. 
Anyhow, have a look into Linux or Unix. You will definitely learn something.<br>

objection to being robed of their intellectual property was immediately 
viciously attacked from all angles by the linux propaganda machine, using lies,

Brain dead linux fanatic:&quot;It's great to see that stupidity and 
ignorance still reign in MS Land &quot;<br>
<br>
 MOST of the ignorance and 
stupidity on the entire planet is concentrated on the linux Goebbels like 
propaganda sites like slashdot.<br>
<br>
 There is more hatred, evil, 
stupidity, nasty mindedness, sheer bloody mindedness and propagation of hatred 
against America, freedom and free enterprise on slashdot and other linux 
fanatic sites than any other site on the planet!<br>
<br>
 Talk about the 
cattle calling the pot black. LOL!<br>
<br>
 You want fanaticism, BS, 
stupidity, ignorance, absolute refusal to face facts and the truth, and a bunch 
of slimy creeps living in cloud cuckoo land, then go to slashdot or any of the 
other fanatically rabid linux sites!<br>
<br>
 &quot;Intelligent part of the 
web&quot;? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br>
<br>
 You mean the part of the web where 
everyone is uniformly brain dead and have their heads in the sand and think 
linux is the magic elixir that makes people 20 feet tall and solves all the 
world's problems?<br>
<br>
 Don't make me laugh, creep!!<br>
<br>
 BTW. Make 
sure you stay in your stupid, drug induced, airy-fairy slashdot/linux world and 
DON'T COME BACK, OK?<br>
<br>
 GOOD RIDDANCE, THAT'S WHAT I SAY!! <br>

I enjoy this. People talking about the merits of 
Windows can bring out facts, figures, and explain why thinking Windows is 
inherently insecure is a misconception.<br>
<br>
 The Pro-Linux side refutes 
with : &quot;Come on don't me laugh.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Gotta love that fanboyism.
<br> <br>
 In the end, the Admin is what makes the system secure. And from the 
obvious maturity of Linux zealots, we can see why Linux is losing it's edge.
