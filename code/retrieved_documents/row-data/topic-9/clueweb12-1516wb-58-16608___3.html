<pre>Ladies and Gentlemen, this cannot go! This forces a reply. Here it comes. 
With all respect to a fellow citizen, this GUI-thinggie is wrong from the 
start. I doubt that it was in the original article !? If yes, then the writers 
are not very competent. One of the troubles M$ had and conceded to have with NT 
was, that certain functions could be accessed only through the GUI. So they 
tried to implement the others and offered those through the Resource Kits, 
because even they (M$) accept, that a useful sysadministration is only possible 
through scripts. Think of the NetLogon that they have for their domains, and 
quite a few more. Just recently Slashdot had a contribution of M$ re-inventing 
the command line, including inventing tab-completion, history, grep, yada yada 
yada... . Why? Surely not for Jack Homeowner. Eh, by the way: even for the 
first release of W2K implementation of *all* system functions on the command 
line was a *must* for the developers. You seem to be mistaken here ... ! Of 
course, the community can and will have to improve on the (remote) 
administration, and a Windoze domain is set up easier than a Unix domain. But 
let us not mislead anyone: where we have to improve is the underlying concepts 
and scripts! To write a GUI for a script is much easier than writing the 
centralised, remote administration. Thanks, Uwe On Tue, 2003-01-14 at 18:24,

Linux &gt; systems,&quot; IDC said. Administrators, too, will become more 
adept. &gt; &quot;Over time, the gap in support costs between Linux and Windows

other Unixes as well) &gt; shouldn't stick with the CLI based admin/management 
tools, and get &gt; some really good GUI thing running for the 
Windows-converted admins. &gt; &gt; I've seen Webmin in action, and intend on 
actively playing with it &gt; soon. What other GUI admin and management tools 
do you all use out &gt; there? &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Colin Charles,
