<h1> Linux vs. Windows: Which is Most Secure? </h1> 
<h3> A point by point comparison of the two OSes, with a subjective conclusion 
as to which offers better security. Plus: some thoughts on Apple security.</h3>

<p><em>Editor's Note: A lot has changed since this article was written so we 
decided to take another look at the topic. Check out the new article,</em><em>
Is Linux Really More Secure than Windows?</em><em>, to see what the findings 
are&nbsp;... you might be surprised (or not).</em></p> 
<p>I&#146;m more secure on Linux than I am on Windows. Yup, that&#146;s right. 
I have no doubt whatsoever that I am.</p> 
<p>I started down this path by comparing how secure I am on a Mac vs. on 
Windows, then I compared Mac vs. Linux. To complete that trifecta, I guess 
it&#146;s only fair to compare the end-user data security aspects of Windows 
against Linux.</p> 
<p>Before I get into my rationale, though, just a little more background is in 
order. I started using a UNIX desktop way back in college and was always 
comfortable there. At my first couple of jobs after college, I mostly used UNIX 
workstations from Dec and Sun as my primary desktops.</p> 
<p>Later, I started using Windows-based systems at the office, but never felt 
quite at home. I was constantly frustrated by the frequent reboots, lack of 
serious security capabilities (from my perspective), and such. Then, following 
a brief foray in OS/2, I quickly gravitated to running Linux at home so I could 
once again have a real multi-tasking working environment.</p> 
<p>Nowadays, my primary desktop is on a Macbook Pro &#150; the best computer 
I&#146;ve ever owned, without any doubt.</p> 
<p>But, I still run a Debian Linux infrastructure for my company, with a 
couple Samba servers at its core. It&#146;s not uncommon for the Linux systems 
to go over a year in between reboots. And, I still use XP on another laptop 
from time to time, generally when a customer requires it or I absolutely must 
run something like ActiveX controls on a web site. I try my best to learn how 
to best use the security features of each OS I use, naturally.</p> 
<p>So, with that background in mind, it&#146;s clear my views are somewhat 
biased. However, I consider myself very open-minded and will always give credit 
where it&#146;s due. Heck, some of my best friends use Windows (but I do my 
best to talk them into OS X anyway).</p> 
<p>&#149; <strong>True to UNIX.</strong> It&#146;s tough to be entirely fair 
here, since Windows isn&#146;t UNIX in any sense. But my point here is that 
Linux does follow the security features and capabilities it inherited from UNIX 
quite closely. In particular, the notion of an administrative (root) user that 
maintains and operates the system, and desktop users who only run the software 
on the system, is completely ingrained in most Linux distributions.</p> 
<p>Now it&#146;s true that many Linux users ignore these features and run all 
their software from a root-level account anyway, but that&#146;s a choice that 
they&#146;ve made. The system defaults to protecting the operating system 
components from its user&#146;s actions (intentional or otherwise). That 
feature alone must account in large degree for the dearth of viruses and other 
malicious vermin on Linux and UNIX platforms.</p> 
<p>Windows, on the other hand, started life as a single user system, with that 
single user being all-powerful. Although that&#146;s no longer the case, the 
general attitude can still be found in many Windows-based software products 
&#150; many of which just can&#146;t be installed and/or run properly without 
desktop administrator privileges. This is all changing for the better, but it 
took Microsoft far too long to adopt this default-secure configuration practice.
</p> 
<p><strong>Qualitative score: Windows gets a D+ while Linux gets an A-.
