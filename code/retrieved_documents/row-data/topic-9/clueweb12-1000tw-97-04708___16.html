Solutions &gt; Software &gt; Linux Kernel 3.3 Released <br>

<h1>Linux Kernel 3.3 Released</h1>  6:00 PM - March 19, 2012 by Douglas Perry -
source:LKML <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Linus Torvalds announced the final version of the new Kernel 3.3, 
which comes with a long list of new features.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Included are new features for the network stack, graphics drivers, Android 
code, storage support as well as basic architecture changes that enables ARM 
systems to address more than 3.8 TB of memory.</p> 
<p>According to the published changelog, version 3.3 improves the handling of 
Intel's RC6 power saving mode, which enables Linux to reliably work with Sandy 
Bridge graphics units. The Nouveau driver package for Nvidia NVA3 (and up) GPUs 
now supports audio output via HDMI. AMD Evergreen GPUs now also support audio 
output via HDMI.</p> 
<p>The developers have also invested some effort to &quot;fight 
bufferbloat&quot;, which is a scenario of latency and throughput issues that 
are caused by excessive buffering. Byte queue limits are introduced to help 
solve the problem and enables developers to set a configurable limit of packet 
data. The Kernel 3.3 now also includes a NVMe driver, which acts as an 
interface for SSDs via PCI or PCIe.</p> 
<p>Also noteworthy is the return of Android subsystem and feature code. The 
code was previously removed due to &quot;disagreements&quot;. The kernel 
developers said that some subsystems and features are already available again 
and more will become available in the future.</p> Share: <br>

<p>I just updated my Lubuntu kernel and my Intel i3 Vostro laptop appears to 
be using about 20 percent less power compared to the 3.1 kernel I previously 
had (according to &quot;powertop&quot;). The kernel seems to be more stable on 
my system than the 3,1 kernel so far. This is a good article, I didn't realize 
that the kernel just can out, I though it was still in the rc stages. Thanks 
for the article.</p> whimseh  03/20/2012 12:47 PM <br>

It isn't better than Windows... at all. It's good for servers but I

<br>
<br>You will never get a consensus with that answer. <br>
<br>
Both OSes have 
their strong points. Why not install it on a virtual machine and test a 
distribution like Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora,... and formulate you own opinion.<br>

<br>I do give you recommendation, and that is patience. A lot a things work 
differently from Windows, so it might take some time to get used to.

&quot;better&quot; is relative. While I believe the difference 
between Linux and Windows for daily casual computing (word processing youtubing 
etc) is nonexistent. But i suggest you try out a distro like mint if you are 
interested getting into linux.

No, Linux is not Unix-based. It 
was written to be compatible with Unix, but is not based on it. Windows NT, 
which is the basis for all Windows versions since Windows 2000 (to be clear, 
excluding ME), were, as far as I know, Unix-based. iOS is probably (as in I 
haven't investigated) is probably Mac-based, hence Unix-based via BSD. Android 
and ChomeOS are both Linux (no, they are not just Linux-based, they are Linux 
[they use the Linux kernel]).<br>

Well, as others have said, differences 
are relative. Windows is better for games, but only because it is the only OS 
that the majority of PC games can be played on. The only major difference 
between Linux and Windows for casual use is that M$ doesn't have a Linux 
version of Office, you don't have IE, and there can be difficulties on Linux 
because of software patents on audio or video codecs (or the likes of CSS for 
DVDs). But Linux is free, has easy access to lots of free software, no-one can 
be bothered to write viruses for it (not that they would have an easy time 
anyway), and can have several advantages in specific situations. I think that 
the best way to try Linux is to use a LiveCD/DVD/USB rather than a virtual 
machine, and I would suggest trying a KDE-based distro such as openSUSE rather 
than some others.

Thank you. I was wondering how long it would be before 
someone pointed that out. I listed them according to how consumers perceive 
them. But for that matter Mac is not Unix based but MacOSX is. <br>

<br>
<br>It use to have more advantages over windows than it does now. It use to 
have a very clean UI, which has now been cluttered in most versions. It use to 
be the only thing with free AV editing software, but now Windows and Mac both 
have editing softwares. It use to be great for tinkering with to get your 
computer to do things it otherwise would not be able to do... but now it is so 
easy to develop on Windows that there is little point. It also use to be 
clunkey and hard to use for every-day stuff... but now they have largely fixed 
that in most distros<br>
It does still win on 3 key fronts: 1) most distros are 
free, which is important when you have a lot of computers that you would have 
to purchase windows for. 2) It is secure beyond belief. While the programs that 
run on top of linux can be hacked or damaged, there is little to no fear of 
your kernal being compromised (unless you have an easy password to crack), so 
it is great for things where you are not sure what you are getting yourself 
into. 3) It has pro level networking options and makes great low-overhead 
servers.

It uses the Linux kernel, making it 
Linux-based. But the rest of the software stack is Google. Everything you run 
on it has to be built for Android libraries/runtime.

<br>It isn't better than Windows for a home user. Only scenarios where Linux 
isn't a massive pain in the ass to use is as a set-and-forget standalone server 
that won't network with Windows boxes. Or put it in a virtual box which is what 
I do when I need to run some CERN stuff that's unix based.

Wonder what kind of hardware you 
have... I have a rather high-end machine and everything is supported (kind of). 
I can't take Linux serious until I open the terminal... then I can't take 
Windows seriously. It's all about what you do. I love both OSs and use both 
daily.

<br>Are you a gamer? Do you HAVE to have MS Office? Answer No to both of those 
and you might be able to get by on a Mac or with Linux on your PC. With Linux 
though, the GUI is pretty different and you're able to do more things with 
commands, much like the MS DOS days. It has the best of both worlds.<br>

more support from hardware manufacturers and games.<br>

Saying &quot;period&quot; after a statement does 
not make the statement more final or correct. Rather, it makes it seem like you 
have no clue.<br>
<br>
Linux affords a degree of freedom which makes it 
difficult to go back to anything else. If you don't care about gaming and are 
some what proficient with a computer, Linux can be a very powerful OS.</p>

A bunch of games are listed for 
Wine too. Apple is really helping Linux in the games area because of OpenGL/CL. 
Years ago when Linux was just starting, Win 95/98 days you could buy linux 
based games in retail shops along side MS software, I remember buying some. MS 
quickly jumped onto their proprietary Direct X bandwagon and effectively killed 
off Open GL gaming. MS thought they killed off Apple for other reason but that 
has failed. Apple uses Open Open GL/CL because like Linux Apples OS is based 
off of UNIX. Not one game for the iPad or other Apple computers use Direct X, 
thank God. STEAM now has MAC too, no DX there either.<br>
Long Live Open GL/CL 
and all Open Source software.<br>

That's why I hate

that a kernel. What's next? A built in C++ compiler into the kernel?<br>

Even Linus has already admitted what pile of shit he has unleashed upon the
