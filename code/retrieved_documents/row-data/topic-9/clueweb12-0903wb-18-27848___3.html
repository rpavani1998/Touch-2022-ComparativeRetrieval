<h1>De Windows para Linux</h1> 
<p>This is what everyday users usually find better, mostly the same, or not as 
good, when switching from Windows to Linux.</p> 
<h2>What is better in Linux</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>
<h3>It's free</h3>  Ao contr&aacute;rio do Windows, o GNU/Linux &eacute; 
software livre &ndash; livre. Instale-o em todos os computadores e fa&ccedil;a 
c&oacute;pias para os seus amigos!At&eacute; pode estud&aacute;-lo, 
transformando-o como necessite, ou construindo-o e vendendo a sua 
pr&oacute;pria distribui&ccedil;&atilde;o.</li> 
<li>
<h3>Programs</h3>  There are a wealth of free applications available at no 
cost under Linux. To edit professional documents, burn music CDs, rework 
photos, design a website, or organise music; there's no need for $200 software 
with restrictive licenses.<br>
 The internal installer makes it incredibly easy 
to find, install and remove programs.<br>
 It's also safe: you can forget the 
demo/trial crippled software, or harmful freeware polluting the web.</li> 
<li>
<h3>No fighting</h3>  Manter o seu computador em forma durante muito tempo 
n&atilde;o necessita de ser um esfor&ccedil;o. E at&eacute; poder&aacute; 
trazer o seu velho PC de volta &agrave; vida.<br>
 Also, Linux lets you choose 
what you want and what you don't. If you had a hard time getting rid of MSN 
Messenger, Windows Update notifications, or Clippit the paperclip, you'll find 
it refreshing.</li> 
<li>
<h3>Security</h3>  Forget expensive and restrictive anti-virus, anti-spyware, 
anti-anything and anti-everything. Linux is very, very secure.<br>
 It is often 
difficult for Windows users to believe that there are<em>no spyware nor viruses
</em> under Linux &mdash; but it's true. Malicious programs have a hard time 
doing anything at all in a well-built system.<br>
 Regular, easy software 
updates will keep everyone entirely safe.</li> 
<li>
<h3>Support</h3>  Linux benefits from a great sense of community whose 
friendliness will surprise you. If you try to do something complicated but 
can't succeed, there are a lot of people around to help you out. Our &quot;Mais
&quot; page gives a few pointers.<br>
 The companies behind the main GNU/Linux 
distributions, such asCanonical and Red Hat, also provide expert commercial 
support.</li> </ul> 
<h2>What is mostly the same in Linux</h2> 
<p>Fundamentally, everyday users will find GNU/Linux similar in use to Windows 
or Mac OSX.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<h3>General set-up</h3>  If you still believe Linux is controlled with code 
and command-line, you should update your views!<br>
 Just like Windows, Linux 
has to boot when you switch your computer on, and then you use programs in it 
to do different things. The taskbar and layout of applications will feel 
familiar to Windows or Mac OS users.<br>

<h3>Web browsing and common tasks</h3>  The Web looks just the same when 
viewed with Linux (in fact you can browse the Web with the same program if you 
already useFirefox or Google Chrome). And of course, you can go through your 
picture and music collection all the same. Files and folders are navigated with 
a file manager like Windows Explorer.</li> </ul> 
<h2>What is not as good in Linux</h2> 
<p>&quot;Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it.&quot; 
&mdash; Mark Twain;</p> 
<p><em>or:</em></p> 
<p>&quot;Tell the truth and run.&quot; &mdash; Yugoslavian proverb.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<h3>Driver support</h3>  Manufacturers of computer hardware don't always (yet) 
release drivers for Linux or publicize full specifications.<br>
 So, drivers 
are sometimes unavailable for the most recent high-end graphics cards &mdash; 
some are reverse-engineered from Windows drivers by volunteers. Some are also 
released free of charge, but under restrictive licenses.<br>
 Sadly, the same 
problem occurs with many low-end WiFi cards.<br>
 However, the vast majority of 
computers with standard hardware work out of the box with main Linux 
distributions. Common hardware such as USB keys or photo cameras never are a 
problem.</li> 
<li>
<h3>DVDs, restricted formats</h3>  Many multimedia formats in use are 
proprietary and not openly specified; this means, broadly speaking, that Linux 
programmers have to find out how to read them without any help from the format 
designers.<br>
 This might lead you to circumvent the restrictions in some DVDs 
and theDRM in some music files, even if you purchased them in full legality, to 
be make them work under Linux. Unfortunately, depending on where you live,<em>
such circumvention processes may be illegal</em> even if you purchased your 
media entirely legally.<br>

MP3s under GNU/Linux? <br>

<h3>Gaming</h3>  Hard-core computer gamers, you might find that the Linux 
gaming world is less professional and out-of-the-box than under Windows: the 
large game developing companies are only slowly getting interested in the free 
software world, which means that many well-known titles do not work on Linux, 
or need special restrictive emulators to work.<br>
 There is a very active free 
software game development community though, and they have produced quite a few 
high-quality games, both 2D and 3D, that are free software. You can head to the
Ubuntu gaming forum to find more information.<br>

<h3>Hibernating</h3>  Because of the driver issues above, hibernating is not 
always reliable. The most common occurrence is the loss of WiFi connection 
after hibernating on laptops whose hardware drivers are not free.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p>Whether you are going to enjoy Linux depends mostly on what you expect from 
it.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you wish Linux to be just exactly like Windows, you will probably be 
disappointed. GNU/Linux is built by people who simplywish it to be different. 
In the free software community, members have different visions of what makes an 
ideal operating system. These differences lead to variety, which is what makes 
Linux so special and interesting.</li> 
<li>Your freedom matters. Thousands in communities and companies work to build 
software on which you may exert this freedom. Using GNU/Linux is the easiest 
way to do so fully.</li> 
<li>It's fun! Not having to worry about spyware, viruses, program 
registrations, demos that expire, or finding software that is really free as in 
freedom, makes using a computer suddenly very enjoyable.</li> </ul> 
<p>We hope you'll switch soon. There's a large community waiting, and no one 
in it asking you to &quot;sign up, purchase and register&quot;.</p> <br>
