<p>Most people first learn how to program serially. Later they learn about 
multitasking and threading. But with the advent of multicore processors, most 
programmers are still pretty intimidated by the prospect of true parallel 
programming.</p> 
<p>To help serial programmers make the transition to parallel, we talked to 
distinguished IBM engineer Paul E. McKenney. (McKenney maintainsRCU in the 
Linux kernel and has written the detailed guidebook <em>Is Parallel Programming 
Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It?&nbsp;</em>) Here&rsquo;s what he 
had to say.</p> 
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What makes parallel programming harder than 
serial programming? How much of this is simply a new mindset one has to adopt?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>McKenney:</strong> Strange though it may seem, although parallel 
programming is indeed harder than sequential programming, it is not<em>that</em>
 much harder. Perhaps the people complaining about parallel programming have 
forgotten about parallelism in everyday life: Drivers deal naturally with many 
other cars; sports team members deal with other players, referees and sometimes 
spectators; and schoolteachers deal with large numbers of (sometimes unruly) 
children. It is not parallel programming that is hard, but ratherprogramming 
itself.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, parallelism can pose difficult problems for longtime 
sequential programmers, just asGit can be for longtime users of revision 
control systems. These problems include design and coding habits that are 
inappropriate for parallel programming, but also sequential APIs that are 
problematic for parallel programs.</p> 
<p>This turns out to be a problem both in theory and practice. For example, 
consider a collection API whose addition and deletion primitives return the 
exact number of items in the collection. This has simple and efficient 
sequential implementations but is problematic in parallel. In contrast, 
addition and deletion primitives that do not return the exact number of items 
in the set have simple and efficient parallel implementations.</p> 
<p>As a result, much of the difficulty in moving from sequential to parallel 
programming is in fact adopting a new mindset. After all, if parallel 
programming really is mind-crushingly difficult, why are there so many 
successful parallel open-source projects?</p> 
<p><strong>Q: What does a serial programmer have to rethink when approaching 
parallel programming? Enterprise programmers know how to multitask and thread, 
but most don&rsquo;t have a clue how to tap into the power of 
multicore/parallel programming.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>McKenney: </strong>The two biggest learning opportunities are a) 
partitioning problems[SK7]&nbsp; to allow efficient parallel solutions, and b) 
using the right tool for the job. Sometimes people dismiss partitioned problems 
as &ldquo;embarrassingly parallel,&rdquo; but these problems are exactly the 
ones for which parallelism is the most effective. Parallelism is first and 
foremost a performance optimization, and therefore has its area of 
applicability. For a given problem, parallelism might well be the right tool 
for the job, but other performance optimizations might be better. Use the right 
tool for the job!</p> 
<p><strong>Q: What can best help serial programmers retool themselves into 
parallel programmers?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>McKenney: </strong>All tools and languages, parallel or not, are 
domain-specific. So look at the tools and languages used by parallel 
programmers in application domains that interest you the most. There are a lot 
of parallel open-source projects out there, and so there is no shortage of 
existing practice to learn from. If you are not interested in a specific 
application domain, focus on tools used by a vibrant parallel open-source 
project. For example, the project I participate in has been called out as having
made great progress in parallelism by some prominent academic researchers. </p> 
<p>But design is more important than specific tools or languages. If your 
design fully partitions the problem, then parallelization will be easy in 
pretty much any tool or language. In contrast, no tool or language will help a 
flawed design. Finally, if your problem is inherently unpartitionable, perhaps 
you should be looking at other performance optimization.</p> 
<p>Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the Great Programming Crisis was at least as 
severe as the current Great Multicore Programming Crisis. The primary solutions 
were not high-minded tools or languages, but rather the lowly spreadsheet, word 
processor, presentation manager, and relational database. These four lowly 
tools transformed the computer from an esoteric curiosity into something that 
almost no one can live without. But the high-minded tools and languages of the 
time are long forgotten, and rightly so. The same thing will happen with 
parallelism: The average person doesn&rsquo;t care about fancy parallel 
languages and synchronization techniques; they just want their 
smartphone&rsquo;s battery to last longer.</p> 
<p>Of course, I have my favorite languages, tools and techniques, mostly from 
the perspective of someone hacking kernels or the lower levels of parallel 
system utilities. I have had great fun with parallel programming over the past 
two decades, and I hope your readers have at least as much fun in the decades 
to come!</p>
