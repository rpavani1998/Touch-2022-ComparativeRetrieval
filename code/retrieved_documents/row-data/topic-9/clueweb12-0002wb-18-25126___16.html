<h1>Linux <em>Myth Dispeller</em></h1>By 
&quot;mailto:%20Ken@KenAndTed.com%20&quot;&gt;[name redacted at author's 
request] <br>
 There are plenty of Linux (and Unix) myths that have been 
creeping around the Internet, presenting a danger to the growth of Linux and 
its eventual overtake of Windows, DOS, and Macintosh. To prevent such a 
tragedy, I attempt to dispel many of the myths that plague Linux's reputation. 
Based on what I have seen in on-line newspapers, magazines, newsgroups, and on 
the Web, I have compiled a list of false-myths about Linux, and I explain where 
(if at all) these myths are based, and what the facts are. For general Linux 
information, seelinux.com or the Linux Documentation Project. 
<p>Additional Myths<br>
 I'm sure there are myths I haven't mentioned here. If 
you think one needs to be listed, pleasee-mail me.</p>

<h2>Installation &amp; Setup</h2>There are probably the worst myths about 
Linux for its installation &amp; setup. While Linux can be made to have a 
challenging installation &amp; setup, most distributions take care of it for 
you.
<h3>Linux is a nightmare to install</h3>I installed Linux in less than an 
hour, and was up and running. The installation can be handled manually, in 
which case it may take a while (this would be copying each file set, and 
unpacking them by hand). However, nearly every distribution has an installation 
program that mealy prompts you for what to install, and some basic settings, 
then does all the work for you. After getting a Linux CD, you'll probably be up 
and running within an hour. In the olden days, this has been true, and Linux 
can be made hard to install.
<h3> Setting up Linux requires hours of time, and can only be done by experts
</h3>This myth is perpetuated by the fact that Linux is so customizable. 
Changing, recompiling, and other modifications that can only be done under Unix 
systems and not under Windows makes Linux an operating system that can be 
configured to do and be just about anything. When you install most Linux 
distributions, the OS is every bit as setup as Windows 95 or Mac System. The 
catch is, Windows 95 and Mac System have a limited set of changes you can make. 
Experts of course can reconfigure more, such as rewriting some of the 
utilities, but everyday users are perfectly capable of configuring standard 
usage settings.
<h3> After you install Linux, you still don't have any everyday software</h3>
To some extent, this can be said about any operating system. Saying, however, 
that Linux has less install-time software than Mac System or Windows, is 
laughable. Linux distributions comes with all the development software, 
Internet software (besides Netscape), and system-related software you'll need. 
While Linux does come with games, some office-related software, however, those 
do leave something to be desired, but no more than Mac System or Windows. 
Because Linux is really a full Unix, it comes with everything you'd seen in a a 
standard Unix build, too.
<h2>The System</h2>The Linux system and kernel are very powerful. Of all the 
fictional Linux myths, these are probably the most untrue.
<h3>Linux multitasks only as well as Windows or Mac</h3>Microsoft and Apple 
would have you believe that their operating systems multitask (run more than 
one program at once). Using the term loosely, they do. Using the term strictly, 
they task-switch only. Although more than one program may be opened, you may 
notice that sometimes the system stops responding -- perhaps while mounting 
(detecting) a CD, or scanning a floppy drive. That's because of cooperative 
multitasking, as opposed to Linux's preemptive multitasking. A cooperative 
multitasker (such as Mac System or Windows) will give a program control of the 
system until the program chooses to give it back. Therefore, when a program is 
taking a while on a specific procedure, it can hang up the system, and deny 
other programs operating time. In a preemptive multitasker, a program is given 
a set number of clock cycles, then it is preempted, and another program has the 
system for a set number of clock cycles. Linux is preemptive through and 
through. Mac System has absolutely nothing preemptive about it (although Apple 
claims the new OS will be partially preemptive). Windows 3.1 has a preemptive 
mouse only. Windows 95 is partially preemptive. Between Apple and Microsoft, 
their only fully preemptive multitasker is Windows NT.
<h3>Linux is slow</h3>A few DOS programs that act as their own OS may do some 
things faster than their Linux counterparts. This is simply because they aren't 
being multitasked by the system. Other than that, Linux tends to be faster. One 
operating system that does operations comparable to Linux is NT. Linux is well 
over twice as fast as NT. Mac System is consistently slower, as are most 
Windows programs.
<h3>Linux crashes frequently</h3>Hardware is often ignored by other operating 
systems. On the other hand, Linux takes advantage of all the hardware it can. 
Sometimes, if you have defective hardware that other operating systems don't 
take advantage of, Linux will crash. This is to be expected. Claiming an OS 
should remain stable when your memory doesn't retain information is 
unrealistic. A properly set up Linux system that is running on good hardware 
will nearly never crash. This is because, if the operating system doesn't bring 
itself down, nothing will. Programs can never crash the system under Linux, 
because of the way it's built with things like memory protection, instruction 
monitoring, and other devices built into any true kernel. For example, in 
Linux, the &quot;General Protection Fault&quot; error can be triggered only if 
your computer's memory is simply not keeping its information (in which case, 
you should return it to the factory).
<h3>Linux does not support threads</h3>Does it ever! Linux supports fully 
preemptive threads for all programs and scripts that request it! The simple 
truth is, Linux has better threading than Windows 95 or NT's threads, and Mac 
System and Windows don't have threads if they aren't managed by the program or 
a third-party library.
<h3>The Linux operating system is to huge too be practical</h3>There are two 
ways an operating system can be big. In hard drive space, and in memory. DOS is 
always going to be smaller than Linux. If you think DOS is the operating system 
of the future, enjoy its compact design. Windows, on the other hand, is 
terribly bloated. While Windows 95 and Linux take up similar amounts of 
hard-drive space, Linux has much more packed into the disk space used. 
Installations designed for desktop users run around 100 megs, with all the 
toys, gadgets, utilities, and development software -- Internet servers, the 
same. In memory, Windows 95 takes up obscene amounts of memory, enough to make 
a kernel programmer dizzy. Although the Windows 95 box says 4 megs, the OS 
can't even fit itself in 4 megs, and gets swapped in and out, without any 
programs running. Linux, on the other hand, with all its power, takes up about 
1/4 of the memory Windows 95 does. Alas, NT takes up more memory than any other 
operating system to date, and Mac System's usage is comparable to 3.1's, which 
takes up about as much as Linux.
<h3>Linux is hard to network</h3>For Mac, it's AppleTalk. For Novell, it's 
IPX. For Windows, it's a mystery. For the Internet, it's TCP/IP. Linux supports 
them all. As you may know, TCP/IP (the Internet protocol family) is the best 
networking protocol, and is native to Unix. It is also native to Linux. 
Networking Linux can be done in one weekend (assuming you do have network 
cards), with some reading, testing, and setting up. Connecting it to the 
Internet takes about 10 minutes. Networking always has some stigma to it, but 
Linux is certainly no worse than other operating systems.
<h3>Linux is an insecure operating system</h3>Generally, Unix-like systems 
have a reputation of being insecure. Linux compares very well to other Unixes, 
due to its open status. Another myth about open OSes in general is that they 
are insecure, which is based on the thought that its weeknesses are exposed in 
its source code. However, when its code is readily obtainable, more experts are 
likely to download it and report its bugs. On the other hand, with a closed 
system like Rhapsody or Windows NT, only crackers (&quot;hackers&quot;) 
actually reverse engineer the code to exploit its security issues. Time has 
proven this thoery: Remember when the Netscape bug was discovered by a student? 
How likely is it that the bug would have been exposed, if he weren't able to 
download the security-related source and inspect it. There are a growing number 
of Linux-based ISPs and Web servers, and very few cracking incidents have 
happened on these. Research information regard security at. 
<h2>Software &amp; Development</h2>Software, and the development of it, is 
great under Linux. The myths here are nearly as bad as the installation &amp; 
setup myths.
<h3>There is no office software, or software at all for Linux</h3>Most Linux 
distributions come with a huge collection of software, certainly more than 
you'd find in Windows or MacOS. Office softare, Linux does not<i>come</i> with 
much of. There's some to download, which compares very well to lousy Mac and 
Windows office software like Works (except with full justify &lt;g&gt;). Just 
like on a Macintosh or Windows software, you can spend large amounts of money 
for commercial office suits. ApplixWare, Star Office and others come with the 
features of MS Office, but tend to run cleaner and faster. Because for many 
users, non-&quot;copylefted&quot; software is offensive, Linux also has a vast 
collection of freeware programs.
<p>Here are a few software resources...</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Woven Goods for Linux Has a fair collection of Linux apps in a well 
categorized list.</li> 
<li>Linux Applications and Utilities Page is a great resource page, and has 
lots of great applications ready for download</li> 
<li>Red Hat Software publishes the Linux version of Applix, and has plenty of 
great software resources to download.</li> </ul>Here is a few of my favorite 
programs that didn't come with my distribution...
<ul> 
<li>TkDesk is simply glorious. This program combines the greatest features of 
Finder, Explorer w/Windows 95, Norton Desktop, but on steroids. Preemptive 
thread steroids. Its amazing file manager, menu bar, and utilities make a Linux 
or Unix desktops addictive! [Freeware, GPL]</li> 
<li>Window Programming Environment: OK, it did come with my distribution, but 
doesn't come with many others. It's a great programming editor, for both X and 
charecter mode. It features<strong>custom</strong> syntax highlighting, error 
message parsing, and seamless compiler shelling. Those who have used Borland's 
DOS interface found in Turbo C for DOS will find its similarities uncanny! 
[Freeware, GPL]</li> 
<li>Visual TCL is much like a Visual Basic IDE for TCL/TK. [Freeware, GPL]</li>
</ul>There are of course more, but I'm not here to list the programs I use. 
<h3>Linux software is hard to use Unix-left overs</h3>A lot of the Unix 
software for Linux does have a learning curve. The other more modern Linux 
software is often for the X Window System (the GUI), and is very easy to use 
and learn. Older Unix software may take some time to learn, but, after it is 
learned, is more productive than Macintosh, and similar to Windows-level 
productivity. Newer Linux software shows respect for older software standards 
for fast usage, and combines those tools with modern styles to make software 
easy to learn.
<h3>Linux doesn't support Java</h3>Just like any other modern Unix, Linux 
supports Java applications with kernel integration to the interpreter, compiles 
Java applications and applets, and has Java-enabled Web browsers (such as
Netscape). Here is some information on Java and Linux: 
<ul> 
<li>Java-Linux Porting Project: Has general information about the Java port to 
Linux.</li> 
<li>Linux Java Tips and Hints Page: Is mainly for developers, and has tips and 
tricks for programmers who use Java.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Linux is impossible to develop for</h3>When you get Linux, you get tons of 
great compilers (including GCC &amp; G++). Most distributions include a program 
called Window Programming Environment (WPE), which provides a programming 
environment with custom syntax-highlighting, compiling, and everything else an 
IDE should have. The operating system also provides libraries that you must 
normally program yourself (including sound, graphics, and more). This myth is 
totally ungrounded, and is really pretty silly.
<h2>Usability</h2>Linux usability has never been better. Nevertheless, these 
myths constantly bombard the brilliant Linux user interfaces.
<h3>There is no GUI for Linux</h3>But there is! There is -- the X Window 
System. Its drivers have been ported to Intel x86, and it's great! Although the 
interface isn't as standardized as Mac or Windows, I'd say it's still better. 
Some of the widgets are super, and it's a very fast interface. The myth that 
Linux has no GUI is made by those who are ignorant enough to beleive that an 
ISP's Unix shell is as far as Unix extends to.
<h3>Linux's command prompt is <i>worse</i> than DOS's</h3>Linux, like Unix, 
lets you choose your command prompt. There's bash and tcsh, which are both 
clones of various Unix shells. A better statement may be that Linux's command 
prompts are like DOS's on steroids: They support redirection operators, 
scripts, and command prompt functions! If you don't like the power of these 
shells, you can use lsh, a shell that looks, acts, and feels like DOS! So, if 
you view power as bad, Linux is &quot;worse.&quot;
<h3>Linux doesn't support graphicial networking</h3>For Windows and Mac users, 
their ISPs' Unix shell is the full extent of Unix. The fact is, just like those 
text mode shells, Linux support graphical X Window System shells for terminal 
machines. Unix machines have had this for about a decade, Linux has had it for 
years, and just now NT is getting into it.
<h3>The Linux desktop is klunky and unattractive</h3>Sometimes, Mac and (even 
more) Windows users have a bad experience with an X Window System, and never 
seem to get over it. All you have to do to learn that one's user interface is a 
personal preference is to listen to a Mac vs. Windows spam-debate on Usenet. 
With X, most aspects of the interface are so configurable, the user can get his 
or her desktop to look and feel just about like anything, without opening any 
source files.

</ul> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2>It's safe to say Linux is the most compatible operating 
system ever. The compatibility myths are fueled by those who believe Windows is 
the only operating system that is compatible, and therefore by default Linux 
must not be compatible with other standards.
<h3>Linux is PC-exclusive</h3>Linux was created on a PC running Minix, a 
smaller Unix clone. While it is most popular on the x86 PC, the Linux kernel 
has been ported to Power Mac hardware, Sparc workstations, DEC machines, and 
more.
<h3>Linux only supports Linux executables</h3>Natively, Linux supports Minix, 
System V, a.out, and ELF executable formats. In beta now, Linux supports Java 
execitables (J-code). Most Linux distributions come with DOSemu, a DOS emulator 
-- not to mention these fine Linux emulation programs... (information taken from
Linux Applications and Utitities):

<li>XZX a Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48/128/+3 emulator for Unix/X11</li> 
<li>xz80 a Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator</li> </ul> 
<h3>Other operating systems don't run well with Linux</h3>Not only is Linux 
friendly to other operating systems on the same drive (not messing up their 
partitions, ect), it uses their file systems, and includes utilities to help 
have more than one OS. Linux's LILO will load Linux, DOS/Win95, OS/2, and more. 
Its file mapping and mounting allows you to use other file systems, such as 
DOS's FAT16 (with Windows 95 long filenames), OS/2's HPFS file system, Minix's 
and others. Even you don't have other operating systems, Linux has emulators to 
let you run programs that aren't even made for Linux.
<h3>Standard file formats are not accepted by Linux</h3>What file formats are 
and aren't supported is really up the applications. Linux applications support 
as many file formats, if not more than other platforms. When a programmer is 
going to create an application, he or she will have to decide what file formats 
to support. In the Linux free software community, there is a wealth of shared 
and static libraries that the programmer can use to support many file formats. 
Windows and Mac libraries programmers usually have to pay obscene amounts of 
money for such things, and are less likely to buy them. Also, since many Linux 
programs are truly free, and come with their source code, other users add file 
formats to existing applications. For example, look at what the text editor 
Emacs supports extra toys for! <br>
