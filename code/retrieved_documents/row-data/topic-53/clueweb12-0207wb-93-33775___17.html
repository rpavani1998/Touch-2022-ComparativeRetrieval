<p>I used to find it frustrating to see the same low-end lines of 
&quot;brand-name&quot; knives and accessories at my local kitchen shops. And of 
course you just KNOW you're paying too much if there isn't the ever-present 
&quot;big 20% off sale&quot; sign in the window. Or you're expected to bargain 
with some sales clerk or owner (which I HATE doing) just to get what should be 
a fair and clearly posted price to begin with. With the internet and cable 
network food shows, I could clearly see that both professionals and serious 
home cooks had moved beyond these old brands and were discovering real gems 
from around the world, both in terms of brands, and also in terms of styles, 
shapes, and overall design. And so I'm very proud and happy to make these 
incredible knives available to my fellow Canadians at truly fair every-day 
discounted prices! And remember, if you still need help deciding what to buy, 
or are looking for a gift and don't know where to start, feel free tocontact me!
<br> </p> <strong>Price Comparisons</strong>: I try to be as competitive as 
possible with suppliers outside of Canada. When making comparisons, please 
remember that the exchange rate you'll actually pay is actually about 2% above 
the official rate (the credit card companies and PayPal take 2% as their 
conversion fee); you'll pay 7% duty (yes, there is at least 7% duty on knives 
coming into Canada), and you'll pay between $5 and $8 brokerage/handling fee 
from Canada Post (and this fee will be well over $50 if you use UPS, Fedex or 
some other such shipper); my shipping charges are generally half (or less) than 
what you'll pay to ship from a US company into Canada; and you'll have no 
duty/brokerage delays and hassles that cross-border shopping often entails. <br>
<br> 
<p><strong>What should you order?<br>
</strong>If you're not sure where to 
start in putting together a quality knife collection? Here are some of my 
personal favourites best bets depending on your budget and personal style and 
preferences:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Primary knife:</strong> Start with a good all-purpose knife. This 
is what you'll probably end up using 90% of the time in your everyday home or 
professional kitchen.
<ul> 
<li><strong>Santoku</strong>: This style is light, thin, sharp and easy to 
handle. Popular with men and women, it's great for just about any cooking 
style. Razor sharp and versatile -- a super choice for home cooks: trust me, 
you'll never go back to the old chef's knife style once you switch to a Santoku 
and learn to appreciate the smaller size and increased versatility of the blade 
shape. The Santoku is the traditional Japanese cook's knife, so you can rest 
assured that it functions just fine as an everyday knife, and as you can see by 
many celebrity chefs on TV, this style of knife is gaining many converts 
outside of the Asian community now. Top picks:
<ul> 
<li><strong>Easy Maintenance, Rugged, Affordable: </strong>Wusthof Classic 
Santoku, Classic IKON, Grand Prix II Santoku or Culinar Santoku: beautiful 
knife, super-sharp, great-looking. I use the Classic version at home (the 
others are pretty much the same... just different handles, so just choose the 
one you like best). I love the new Classic IKON and would definitely choose 
that model if I had to pick one today. A truly great knife, that I everyone is 
thrilled with. Rachael Ray of FoodTV's 30-Minute Meals uses the Classic version 
of this exact santoku (before she signed an endorsement deal with another 
company).<br>
<strong>Thinner, Sharper, Harder Steel, Affordable:</strong> If 
you're thinking of trying a real Japanese knife, I'd have no hestitation in 
recommending aMisono Molybdenum Santoku or a Sakai Takayuki Santoku. These are 
very nice knives: sharp and durable and very well made with great fit and 
finish, at a truly fantastic price -- all-around great values without a doubt 
(don't let the affordable prices fool you!). TheSakai Takayuki Japanese-made 
damascus santokus are now my best-selling santokus, and they are very sharp and 
high quality, and an incredible value if you love that damascus look (and who 
doesn't!) And if you're thinking of going old-school with the ultimate 
performance of a carbon steel blade, don't miss a superbMoritaka santoku! <br>

<strong>Hardest Steel, Super Sharp, Best Looks and Performance: </strong>And if 
you want something really high-end with superb steel and incredible balance and 
the best construction quality, check out theTakayuki 63-layer and Misono UX10 
Santoku and see why these are now my #1 best seller among professional chefs 
and serious home cooks. Both are truly superb high-end knives.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Classic Chef's/Cook's Knife</strong>: if you prefer a traditional 
European/Western shape, go with a standard French/German chef's/cook's knife. 
The added length and curve of the blade can be very comfortable if you're used 
to the traditional &quot;rocking&quot; motion. You can't go wrong with any of 
these:
<ul> 
<li>Wusthof Classic, Classic IKON, Grand Prix II, Le Cordon Bleu or Culinar 
Cook's Knife. Great looking, and serious performance and durability. Or again, 
if you're thinking of trying a Japanese knife because you want something 
lighter and thinner than a German knife but prefer a traditional shape, the
Misono Molybdenum and UX10 chef's knives are light, strong, and an abolute 
pleasure to own and use. You're in love with the damascus steel look?...then 
check out this beautifulSakai Takayuki 8.3&quot; model. Or if you're in love 
with the idea of a granton edge (dimples) Japanese knife and want something 
really nice without breaking the bank, the Sakai Takayuki (8.3&quot; or 
9.5&quot;) are fantastic and a great value (they're made with excellent and 
hard steel, and very durable handles). Should you get an 8&quot; or a 9&quot; 
chef's knife? Well, traditionally the 8&quot; chef's knife has been a standard, 
but these days, many people opt instead for a santoku which is just a little 
bit smaller but perhaps more versatile and easier to handle. The 8&quot; chef's 
knife is certainly still the best-selling size, but if you're a professional 
chef or culinary school student or if you already have a santoku and want 
something bigger to complement it, then it can make sense to move up to a 
9&quot; or 10&quot; (or 240mm/9.5&quot; in the case of Japanese knives) chef's 
knife. Most Japanese knives are also thinner and lighter than the German knives 
like the Wusthof Classic/GrandPrix2/Culinar chef's knives, and they don't have 
bolsters, so the very base (heel) of the blade is a bit more useful (if you 
aren't already used to using a knife with a bolster). For example, theMisono 
Molybdenum Series 24cm Chef's Knife is 1cm longer than the Wusthof Classic 
9&quot;, but a full 32 grams (12%) lighter. Mind you, if you really prefer the 
profile of the traditional cook's knife, then by all means go with an 8&quot; 
chef's knife if you're comfortable with that -- I'm sure you'll be pleased. 
Again, the Wusthof are superb and constantly winning awards and &quot;best 
bets&quot; from major publications because they work well, they're rugged, and 
they're easy to maintain and sharpen -- a real no-brainer if you just want a 
no-nonsense knife to cook dinner with. Or if you want the incredible 
performance of a real carbon steel (not stainless) blade, don't miss the 
incredibleMoritaka knives available in all the most popular sizes. </li> 
<li>Consider yourself more &quot;old school&quot; and want some <em>heavy iron
</em>? Then go for a professional size for serious kitchen action: consider the 
larger 10&quot; (260mm) Wusthof Cook's models (all professional-level knives), 
or a 9.5&quot; Japanese knife, like the top-of-the-line Misono UX10 or one of 
the many excellentSakai Takayuki models.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Secondary knife:</strong> A small paring knife for fruit and 
vegetable peeling, paring, slicing and other small jobs, and a utility knife. 
Top picks: I prefer small/short paring knives, so I like the small size and 
razor-sharp edge of the Wusthof 3.5&quot; Paring knives (all lines) andSakai 
Takayuki 3.2&quot; Paring knives-- it's a knife you'll see professional chefs 
use a lot when they want something for preparing small or delicate items where 
a full-size chef's knife is overkill. Similarly, a 4-5&quot; &quot;utility 
knife&quot; is also a great second knife choice if you already have some paring 
knives that are doing the trick. Again, the Japananese Misono Molybdenum 
Utility/Petty knives are really nice, and different in shape than a Wusthof 
utility knife, in that they are shaped more like mini chef's knives rather than 
large paring knives -- not that one is necessarily better than the other, but 
it's something to think about. TheTakayuki 5.3&quot; utility knife is very 
good-looking and an excellent performer at a great price -- my #1 most popular 
such utility knife now, and very handy for smaller slicing/dicing jobs like 
onion, ginger and garlic.</li> 
<li><strong>Slicer (also called Carving Knife):</strong> If you like to 
purchase and prepare larger cuts of meat yourself (whole chickens, etc.), then 
a slicer/carving knife is a great knife to have. The blade is thin and narrow 
in profile, and so a nice item to have for more delicate work (thin slicing), 
or even for cutting sandwiches (I like the thin blade for cutting delicate 
cakes too). This is a standard item in many of the old-fashioned 
&quot;sets&quot; sold by other manufacturers. If you like to prepare fresh fish 
and larger cuts of meat, be sure to also invest in a boning knife or fine fish 
fillet knife. I carry the longer Wusthof fillet knives which are more useful 
and versatile than the short fillet knives more retail outlets carry (why are 
people scared of long knives?!?) The Misono long slicers are also superb, with
the one wielded by TV's &quot;Top Chef&quot; being popular, and the Sakai 
Takayuki line offers a number of superb Japanese slicers at quite reasonable 
prices. Or for the more standard &quot;carving knives&quot; like we're all used 
to, check out the fine Wusthof models. See my full selectionhere. </li> 
<li><strong>Bread Knife/Roast Knife:</strong> Unless you're a dedicated 
sliced-bread person, every household should have a good bread knife. And by 
good, I mean BIG! What's with all these companies making klunky thick-bladed 
8-inch &quot;bread&quot; knives?!? That's really too small to be useful for 
slicing larger loaves or artisan-bakery bread, or even for doing pretty common 
baking jobs like slicing cake layers. That's why I prefer to sell bread knives 
that are at least 9&quot; in length, which in my mind is the ideal size for 
home use. The slicers and bread knives I sell are all fine for the job, with 
nice thin and sharp blades, which make short work of crusty bread or meats. A 
serrated slicer is also handy for general baking/pastry jobs. All in all, a 
thin-bladed serrated slicer is an incredibly useful tool to have around the 
kitchen. I find myself using mine all the time when I'm dealing with something 
with a crusty edge that I need to get through without crushing a delicate 
interior. Not too keen on big unsliced loaves of bread or you don't have lots 
of space in your knife block for such a big blade? Then the &quot;offset 
serrated&quot; knife is a great option. Yes, it's shorter, but in a way it's 
really a more versatile knife, capable of dealing with all kinds of breads and 
other crusty items, including roast meats, veggies, etc. Anthony Bourdain 
recommends this style of knife, as does famous pastry chef Sherry Yard, and I 
keep seeing chefs on Food Network Canada using offset serrated knives too (I 
just saw several on one night's episode of Iron Chef America for example). One 
very sharp, very strong and very big serrated knife which makes a killer bread 
knife and yet isn't too expensive is theWusthof Gourmet 10&quot; Confectioner's 
Knife -- if you want a BIG serrated knife but don't want to spend the extra big 
money, this one is certainly a nice option (and it cuts like CRAZY). Otherwise, 
the most popular traditional &quot;bread knife&quot; I sell is theWusthof 
Classic 9&quot; (forged, very nice, very strong, perfect length; also available 
in theother handle styles). </li> 
<li><strong>Sharpener</strong>: yes, you'll need to do a bit of regular 
maintenance to keep your nice new knife razor-sharp. In my opinion, the easiest 
way to do this is simply with a steel. They're really not that complicated to 
use. Check out thelinks below for more information or here for my full knife 
sharpening tools selection. 
<ul> 
<li> You know, if you don't already have a good steel, before you do anything 
else, go ahead and get one like the standard high qualityWusthof steel, good 
for just about any knife out there (except serrated knifes, which should be 
sharpened by a professional). You don't need the fancy handle of the more 
expensive models -- this one works just fine, and the nice 10&quot; length 
means it's big enough to sharpen even a serious chef's knife blade easily. The 
trick is to simply use it regularly -- DON'T wait until your knife is dull. You 
should actually give your knife a few light strokes on the steel once a week 
(or every few days even). This way your knife will stay sharp and won't NEED a 
serious re-sharpening by a pro or by some sharpening system. The trick is to
<strong>maintain</strong> the edge so you don't have to create a <strong>new
</strong> one. A very affordable and essential too! This is the same sort of 
steel included in all &quot;sets&quot; and in 99% of the kitchen stores out 
there, but in a more versatile 10&quot; length for sharpening longer chef's 
knives. Update: as of 2009 I am now using my10&quot; fine ceramic hone on all 
my knives and have all but retired my trusty old steel. Now that I've gotten 
used to the ceramic, well, I just like how consistent and gentle it is... read 
on...</li> 
<li><strong>Ceramic honing rods:</strong> much has been said about ceramic and 
steel honing rods by ill-informed North-American Japanese knife distributors 
and importers. You'll often hear from these &quot;experts&quot; (they're 
usually simply business-people -- importers/distributors -- NOT knife makers, 
experts or even chefs) that you CAN'T use a steel on a Japanese knife, or that 
a steel will &quot;ruin&quot; a Japanese knife edge somehow, and so they sell 
you their junky drag-through systems with carbide that just tear up the edge of 
the knife. Now, a ceramic rod does work, but you have to understand that a fine 
ceramic is very fine -- almost not abrasive at all, and Japanese knife steel is 
normally harder than German knife steel, so you have to use it regularly 
(daily, or at least a few times a week), or else it simply won't do a darn 
thing. So if you have a Japanese or other knife with a similar polished edge 
(the Misono Japanese knives have polished edges), then a ceramic is a good 
choice. I personally think that some knives with a ground edge (most German 
knives) can keep that nice &quot;bite&quot; in their edge better with a 
traditional steel (metal), but the difference can be subtle. Mind you, I also 
use a steel on Global and other knives, and it works fine for me (with a gentle 
touch!). Your mileage may vary. A LOT depends on your honing technique -- a 
light touch and reverse honing (drag the knife so that the edge trails on the 
steel -- try it, it works!) with a butcher's steel can do wonders. Okay, back 
to ceramic: I was tired of the small and cheap junk sold by the North American 
Japanese knife distributors, so I sought out a quality manufacturer and 
imported them directly. The10&quot; ceramic hones I sell are great, and VERY 
reasonably priced. And if you don't want to bother with stones and want 
something with some actual abrasion to help when the edge really starts to get 
worn (this can take as long as a year or more at home, IF you use your fine 
hone regularly!), I also sell thecoarser model to help bring the edge back. And 
my newall-in-one real Japanese waterstone is fantastic if you want the ultimate 
in old-school versatility and quality!</li> 
<li>To restore a dull edge (when the steel no longer does the job), you can 
use a ceramic or diamond &quot;steel&quot; (see theWusthof fine and medium), or 
one of the easy to use and pretty foolproof sharpening systems byChef's Choice.
, or if you want the control and quality that only a stone and hand sharpening 
can give you, go forJapanese water stones, or for a stone-style edge but with 
ultimate angle control, the stone-basedEdge Pro system gives you the quality 
and control of hand sharpening on a stone, combined with the control over 
angles of a machine (this is also the best choice if you have both Japanese and 
German knives, since you can change the angle). Chad Ward's new book<em>An Edge 
in the Kitchen</em> also highly recommends the EdgePro system as the best of 
the manual guide-based sharpening systems.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>DIMPLES</strong>: Since so many people ask: in my opinion, dimples 
(a &quot;granton&quot; edge) on a santoku or chef's knife do nothing (or VERY 
little at least). They were designed for thin slicers, but manufacturers put 
them on everything now because they look cool and help sell knives. Fact: 
dimples do NOT reduce &quot;suction&quot; and &quot;sticking&quot; like some 
people and sellers claim -- it's really just about reducing friction: since 
there is less material for the food to contact with as it passes the cutting 
edge, theoretically you should be able to get paper thin slices a bit more 
easily. But a good chef just needs a good sharp knife and a little practice to 
get precise and thin slices, not gimmicks. If you like the look and it's not 
much more money, then fine (I'll admin, they DO look kind of cool!), but<strong>
I wouldn't let dimples affect my decision on a particular knife purchase
</strong>. Get the best knife you can for your budget that suits your needs and 
personal preferences in terms of materials, shape and handle styles, and don't 
let dimples factor into the decision until the end!</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Paul's Knife Hints &amp; Tips</strong></p> 
<p>Remember, a knife is a tool designed for cutting. A sharp edge cuts better 
than a dull edge (!), so it follows that a sharp knife is a better tool. So 
keep in mind that a sharp knife is a safe knife, because it allows for more 
precise control and effortless slicing, chopping and cutting, resulting in 
fewer opportunities for slippage and accidental mishandling. Basically, a sharp 
knife lets you concentrate on the job at hand, without worrying about putting 
tons of pressure on the blade or about ruining a delicate item you're trying to 
prepare. So get the best, sharpest knives you can afford, treat them with care, 
keep them sharp, and they should last you a lifetime.</p> 
<p>Forget the fancy rapid-fire knife-handling you see on TV. Take your time, 
remembering to always keep your fingers of the guiding hand (not holding the 
knife) tucked inwards, away from the blade, and your thumb tucking in behind 
your fingers and not sticking out as most of us do without thinking!<strong>
Don't put tons of pressure on the blade. A good sharp knife is a good cutting 
tool, so let it do its job</strong> -- there should be no need (most of the 
time) to push down really hard, and this is especially true with a serrated 
edge, which is designed to cut just fine with gentle and steady pressure and 
movement, without hacking away! If you really need to hack away at something, 
use a tool for the job: a cleaver or other heavy duty knife, not your little 
6&quot; utility knife! And remember, don't just push down; let the sharp edge 
do its job by using a nice steady slicing action.</p> 
<p>In terms of care, try to wash your knife as soon as possible after use 
(NEVER leave it in a sink with dirty dishes), dry it and then put it back 
safely in a proper knife block or magnetic strip, and not in a drawer where 
it'll bang around or where someone could stick their hand in by accident. Don't 
put your knifes in the dishwasher, and don't use abrasives or chemicals to 
clean them. And of course use them for cutting ONLY! They're not hammers, 
screwdrivers, or pry bars. A good knife blade is extremely strong when used 
vertically in a normal cutting motion, but with very hard steel sharpened to a 
fine edge (as it will be on most good Japanese knives!), it could chip or could 
even snap if you try to use if for something like prying. Finally, use a good 
plastic or wooden cutting board, NOT a glass or metal or stone counter or 
board, as a sharp edge hitting a stone surface is of course a recipe for 
dulling!</p> 
<p><strong>Sharpening: </strong>Sharpening knives is probably the only thing 
that arouses more passions, opinions and dogma than buying and using the knives 
themselves! One thing: don't just jump in and hack away with your old coarse 
sharpening steel. This might have been fine to restore some semblance of an 
edge on your old knives, but it can seriously junk the razor-sharp and 
precisely-ground edge on your new Japanese knife, so don't just go at it, and 
don't let your well-meaning friend or family member (why does it always seem to 
be a brother-in-law?!?) do you the favour either. And again, if you do need to 
touch up your blade (which is normal), go slowly and avoid the theatrics of 
swiping the blade over the steel in a swash-buckling manner like you'll 
sometimes see TV chefs do when in full &quot;performance&quot; mode. Go slowly, 
maintain a precise and steady angle (which is why you should take your time!), 
and check the blade frequently so you don't do more than necessary to restore 
the edge. But since I don't profess to be a professional in this area, here are 
some resources to get you started:</p>
