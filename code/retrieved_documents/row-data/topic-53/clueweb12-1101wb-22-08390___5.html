<h2>The Cutting edge - How to pick a chef Knife</h2> &nbsp; <br>
 After 
reading that local chefs Rita Calvert and Ken Upton described a good knife as 
their most treasured kitchen tool, several of my friends and neighbors asked me 
if knives are truly important. My answer is a definitive yes.<br>
<br>
Almost 
every recipe in a cook's repertoire involves cutting of some type, making a 
knife the most frequently used tool in the kitchen. To be effective, a cook 
should have quality, reliable tools, especially when it comes to knives, which 
are inherently risky if uncomfortable to use, dull or inefficient. Professional 
knives, which by their manufacture and design are sharp and well balanced, do 
just one thing very well: They cut.<br>
<br>
Of course, having a knife and 
using it well are two different things. Being able to handle a knife 
effectively can be the determining factor in the taste, texture and 
presentation of a dish. Here is a very brief primer on how knives are made, how 
to buy a knife and how to use it.<br>
<br>
What makes a good knife?<br>
<br>

Kerry Smith, owner of A Cook's Revenge on Main Street in downtown Annapolis, 
provided an insightful refresher course on knives. He reminded me that you 
don't have to spend a lot of money to get a good knife. The veritable scimitars 
you may see wielded by chefs on television are jokes to many restaurant and 
food service chefs. These brilliant cooks who actually use knives every day, 
all day, frequently rely on off-brand knives (found at restaurant supply 
stores) that are as comfortable, sharp and reliable as some of the fancier 
varieties you may see for hundreds of dollars at the mall.<br>
<br>
Of course, 
after toiling in the dregs of a hot kitchen all day, professional chefs do like 
to retreat to the luxurious solitude of their home kitchens, where the tools 
are their own, individually chosen with love. According to Mr. Smith, this 
affection for enduring quality will cost in the range of $50 to $150, with more 
expensive models being sheer luxury.<br>
<br>
Much of the cost of a knife is 
determined by its manufacture, including composition and design. The design of 
a knife directly affects its balance, sharpness and longevity. Stamped blades 
are cut from a thin ribbon of steel using a template, much like a cookie 
cutter. The blades are tempered, sharpened and finished, usually by machine. 
The blade of a stamped knife is fitted into its handle, so the knife is not 
considered one fluid and integral piece. While usually thinner and lighter, the 
design of stamped knives requires a firmer grip and more pressure when 
chopping, mincing and dicing. They are usually priced lower than forged cutlery.
<br><br>
Forged knives offer the top of the line in quality. During production, 
a steel bar is heated to a very high temperature, set into a die and hammered 
to form a blade. It is then crafted by hand through tempering, sharpening and 
finishing, sometimes in up to 50 separate steps. Forged knives will always 
include a bolster and a tang. Knives that are &quot;fully forged&quot; are 
formed from one piece of metal and produce the strongest and sharpest blade.<br>
<br>Mr. Smith noted that while the design of the knife is important, you should 
also consider the composition of the blade specifically.<br>
<br>
Carbon steel 
blades are an alloy of carbon and iron. They sharpen easily, but are prone to 
corrosion and discoloration.<br>
<br>
Stainless steel blades won't rust or 
corrode, but are more difficult to sharpen. Once properly sharpened, however, 
stainless does hold a good edge.<br>
<br>
A high carbon stainless steel blade 
is an alloy combining the best of both worlds: It doesn't discolor or corrode, 
sharpens easily and holds an edge.<br>
<br>
Ceramic knives came on the scene 
about 10 years ago, and are prized for their sharpness and precision. They are 
10 times sharper than steel with no surface tension. They aren't cheap, 
however, and given their brittle nature, they may break and chip more easily 
than a carbon stainless blade.<br>
<br>
Mr. Smith highlighted the five most 
important factors to consider when purchasing a professional knife:<br>
<br>

The knife should be comfortable to hold: It should feel substantial but not too 
heavy, which can lead to fatigue and strain. It should be well balanced in your 
hand with ease of cutting motion.<br>
<br>
It should have a full tang (see 
diagram at left), (as opposed to a 3/4 or &quot;rattail&quot; tang), which 
provides optimal support, strength and balance.<br>
<br>
The bolster should be 
integrated into the blade, not as a separate collar, so that it can provide 
adequate protection to fingers and knuckles.<br>
<br>
The handle should be made 
of moisture-proof polypropylene or stainless steel with a smooth finish. Gaps 
or seams in the handle or between the parts of the knife will cause 
deterioration and can also harbor harmful bacteria.<br>
<br>
A good knife will 
be durable: It should last for years with proper maintenance and regular 
sharpening.<br>
<br>
When you prepare to purchase a good knife, hold it in each 
hand to consider its weight, balance and comfort. Ask the salesperson to try 
the knife; it should cut through office paper without pressure or resistance.
<br><br>
Mr. Smith doesn't advocate purchasing knife block sets sold by mass 
retailers. According to him, these sets contain many knives you don't need and 
may never use due to lack of comfort or knowledge. Instead, focus on purchasing 
just two good knives: a French or chef's knife and a paring knife. A serrated 
slicer makes cutting bread or tomatoes easier, but isn't necessary if you have 
a good, sharp chef's knife. Ditto with a boning knife.<br>
<br>
Knife safety<br>
<br>Knives should come with one of those universal disclaimers stating the 
obvious: Improper use can lead to serious injury. Holding the knife correctly 
is vital for safe and efficient cutting.<br>
<br>
When researching this article 
I turned to Chef John Toohey of Whole Foods Market for advice on knife skills. 
Mr. Toohey graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, where a stray cut 
could lead to an apoplectic professor, much less a failed class. He reminded me 
that when taking the rigorous Master Chef exam, many applicants have been 
rejected based on their knife skills alone.<br>
<br>
Mr. Toohey teaches two 
ways to hold a knife, whether by the tang or the blade. Test which method feels 
comfortable to you using a back-and-forth or up-and-down motion. When cutting, 
always hold the knife with your dominant hand, using the fingertips of your 
opposite hand to hold the object you are cutting. Curl your fingers inward 
toward your palm with your thumb well away from the blade, using your knuckles 
as a guide for the knife. When held properly, the blade will rest lightly 
against your knuckles, ensuring a consistent cut and intact, whole fingertips.
<br><br>
Making the cut<br>
<br>
Once you know how to hold your knife, it's 
time to practice cutting skills. Chef Rita Calvert has mentioned to me many 
times that practicing her knife skills is a mentally and spiritually 
therapeutic exercise. She relishes an opportunity to appreciate the rhythm of 
her work and the beauty of the food, and so should you.<br>
<br>
Good knife 
skills are important, largely because the size, shape and consistency of cut 
foods determine cooking time, and thereby the taste, texture and even 
presentation of a dish. Imagine how chopped shallots taste, look and feel 
differently than minced. Or how chunks of vegetables floating in a silky soup 
would perhaps be better as a small dice. There are numerous basic knife cuts, 
too many to mention here, so Mr. Toohey identified the most important:<br>
<br>

A mince is a very fine, even cut appropriate for herbs, garlic and shallots. 
Use it when you want the object to be physically minimized in the dish.<br>
<br>
Julienne and battonet are long, rectangular cuts of even length and width. 
Julienne produces thin strips appropriate for garnish (crudites) or frying 
(french fries). Battonet can be used similarly, but produces a thicker cut. To 
julienne vegetables of an uneven shape, such as carrots, trim the vegetable so 
that the sides are straight, which will make future cuts much easier. Slice the 
vegetable lengthwise, then stack the slices, align the edges, and make parallel 
cuts of the same thickness through the stack.<br>
<br>
A dice is a cube-shaped 
cut used in making everything from croutons to soup and salads. It is perhaps 
the most familiar, although most frequently poorly executed shape. Dice an 
onion too big and you may have salsa rather than dip; slice it too small and 
you may have charred bits rather than savory silkiness.<br>
<br>
There are four 
basic sizes of dice. To master the cut, properly julienne the fruit or 
vegetable, then cut crosswise at evenly spaced intervals to make a cube. 
Brunoise is a very small dice, precisely 1/8 inch on each side. Small dice is a 
bit larger at 1/4 inch, while medium dice is 1/3 inch and large dice is 3/4 
inch.<br>
<br>
A chiffonade cut produces long, thin ribbons of leafy vegetables 
or herbs and is frequently used for garnish. To chiffonade basil leaves, stack 
the leaves on top of each other, then make fine parallel cuts across the leaves 
to produce fine shreds.<br>
<br>
Practice makes perfect<br>
<br>
Now that you 
have a good knife, know how to hold it and have memorized shapes and sizes of 
cuts, it's time to get to work. These recipes should help you practice your 
knife skills, use some of those vegetables you purchased over the weekend at 
the market, and encourage some culinary meditation.<br>

RATATOUILLE AND 
GOAT CHEESE SALAD WITH PESTO VINAIGRETTE<br>
From Epicurious.com<br>
<br>
For 
pesto vinaigrette:<br>
<br>
3/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves<br>
1/2 
tablespoon minced garlic<br>
1/2 tablespoon minced shallot<br>
1 tablespoon 
freshly grated Parmesan<br>
1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted golden<br>
1 1/2 
tablespoons white-wine vinegar<br>
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
For 
ratatouille:<br>
<br>
1 long narrow Japanese eggplant<br>
1 small zucchini<br>

1 small yellow squash<br>
1 small red bell pepper<br>
1 small green bell pepper
<br>3 tablespoons olive oil<br>
1 small red onion, chopped fine<br>
1 medium 
vine-ripened tomato, seeded and pureed (about 1/2 cup)<br>
2 teaspoons minced 
garlic<br>
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves<br>
2 tablespoons 
finely chopped fresh basil leaves<br>
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme 
leaves<br>
12 ounces soft mild goat cheese at room temperature<br>
8 ounces 
mesclun (mixed baby greens)<br>
To make vinaigrette: In a blender or small food 
processor, blend all vinaigrette ingredients with salt and pepper to taste 
until smooth. Vinaigrette may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring 
vinaigrette to room temperature before using on salads.<br>
<br>
To make 
ratatouille: Cut eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash and bell peppers into 
1/4-inch dice. In a large, heavy skillet, cook eggplant in 1 tablespoon oil 
over moderate heat, stirring until tender, then transfer to a bowl. In skillet 
cook zucchini, yellow squash and onion with salt and pepper to taste in 1 
tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 
minutes, then transfer to bowl. Cook bell peppers in remaining teaspoon oil in 
same manner and transfer to bowl. Stir in tomato puree, garlic, herbs, salt and 
pepper to taste and cool ratatouille completely.<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 375 
degrees and cut a large sheet of parchment paper into eight 5- to 6- inch 
squares.<br>
<br>
On a work surface, put a 3-inch metal pastry ring (at least 
11/2 inches high) or other mold in middle of 1 parchment square and fill it 
with 1/3 cup ratatouille, pressing evenly and tightly into bottom of your mold. 
Cut goat cheese into 8 equal pieces and flatten each piece to form a 3-inch 
disk. Top ratatouille in ring with goat cheese disk, pressing lightly at edges 
to cover ratatouille completely.<br>
<br>
Transfer round on parchment square to 
a large baking sheet and remove ring. Make 7 more rounds in same manner with 
remaining parchment squares, ratatouille and goat cheese. Bake rounds in middle 
of oven 8 to 10 minutes, or until heated through.<br>
<br>
While rounds are 
baking, toss mesclun with 1/4 cup vinaigrette in a large bowl and divide among 
8 plates.<br>
<br>
Use a spatula to transfer a ratatouille round to center of 
each salad. Drizzle each salad with about 1 teaspoon vinaigrette and garnish 
with halved red and yellow cherry tomatoes.<br>
