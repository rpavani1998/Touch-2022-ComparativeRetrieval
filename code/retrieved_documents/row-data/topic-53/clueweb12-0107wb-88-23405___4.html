Knife Edge  By Christopher Tanner <br>
 Monday, May 2, 2011 
<p>People often ask me what my favorite chef knife is and what criteria they 
should use in looking for a knife.</p> 
<p>As a professional, some of us have that one trusty knife that we got at the 
beginning of our career and feel that is the only knife they will ever need. I, 
on the other hand, have probably owned at least five full-size chef knives in 
my career &mdash; until I decided on the one I use the most now.</p> 
<p>I actually keep two now, as I feel each has its own purpose. I could go 
into a whole list of knives for you, but that would make my already long posts 
quite a bit longer. So I will concentrate on just the regular chef knife.</p> 
<p>Before I talk brands, let&rsquo;s talk about what one should look for in a 
knife. The first thing to consider is where you&rsquo;re going to be using 
this, at home or in a professional kitchen. Although there are some who want 
professional quality, it is not always necessary to pay $300 for a knife you 
are just going to use at home. Most people at home or professionals will want 
to seek out a hand-forged, high-carbon stainless steel blade which holds its 
sharpness quite well and is pretty durable.</p> 
<p>Another option is high-carbon steel (not stainless) which is what many 
Japanese high-end knives are made out of. These knives are usually folded the 
way Japanese swords were once made for samurai. Many times the blade is so hard 
though, that if dropped or treated poorly (say, chopping bones), the blade can 
crack. If not dried after use and oiled, the blade may rust as well, so these 
knives take a professional hand.</p> 
<p>Another material that has become slightly popular is ceramic. These share 
the same issues as the folded steel Japanese knives, but are even more fragile. 
They hold a sharp blade even longer.</p> 
<p>Next you will want to make sure that you get a proper handle. Plastic, 
rubber, stainless steel or treated wood are good. Non-treated wood is not as 
good, as it can absorb water and crack or mold. When looking at the handle, you 
want to make sure that the blade goes all the way through the handle, or as 
many call it, a &ldquo;full tang.&rdquo; This is to balance the knife and give 
it durability. Blade size is important as well, and the only way you are going 
to figure out what you like for size is by putting a few knives in your hands 
and maybe even chopping something &mdash; if the store lets you. If a store 
doesn&rsquo;t let you hold the knife, they shouldn&rsquo;t get to hold your 
cash. I prefer a large 12-inch blade, as I have large hands. Others may prefer 
a 10-inch, 8-inch or 6-inch blade. Don&rsquo;t go smaller &mdash; those 5-inch 
blades are just to have a cute knife.</p> 
<p>Those of you at home will probably want to send out your knives to be 
sharpened by a local knife shop or culinary store. Make sure they use a whet 
stone or an oil stone, and that they do not grind their knives. Grinding will 
shorten the life of your knives, as it takes off a larger amount of metal with 
each sharpening. The best way, though, is to buy your own whet stone, have the 
store teach you how to use it. Then you know your knives are being cared for.
</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of knives I have run into and like for different 
reasons. As for pricing, these estimates are for their regular, no frills 
lines. Many of these companies offer funky handle designs and other frills; 
frankly, these are for aesthetics and to make more money off of you.</p> 
<p><b>WUSTHOF:</b><br>
This is a German manufacturer and one of the most 
popular and best knives on the market. A 10-inch blade will run you about $100, 
depending on where you shop.</p> 
<p><b>HENCKELS:</b><br>
Another popular knife, but for some reason, I 
don&rsquo;t like them as much. They just don&rsquo;t seem to hold a blade as 
long as the Wusthof, but they are usually about $5 to $10 cheaper. This is a 
German company as well.</p> 
<p><b>GLOBAL:</b><br>
A very popular trendy knife made in Japan. However, it 
is not the folded steel as many think &mdash; it is stainless steel. They hold 
a sharp blade pretty well, but the handle, which is metal, can be difficult to 
get used to. These run about $130 for a 10-inch blade.</p> 
<p><b>SABATIER:</b><br>
Well, the French do make a chef knife, and from what 
I&rsquo;ve seen, this is the only one I like. I used to use their slicer. It is 
a good quality knife that will run you about $80. I&rsquo;d say they are on par 
with Henckels.</p> 
<p><b>MAC:</b><br>
Pretty popular knives in the professional kitchen set. They 
come in a variety of steels, but the stainless steel runs between $150 and $170 
depending where you shop. This knife stays incredibly sharp and supposedly is 
well worth the price from what I have seen in tests.</p> 
<p><b>FURI:</b><br>
Alright, I&rsquo;m putting this one here because many 
people tell me they like these knives. They are made in Australia and 
everyone&rsquo;s darling Rachael Ray is there spokesperson, these are the 
knives you see here using on her show. I&rsquo;m guessing these aren&rsquo;t 
too popular in professional kitchens, and I&rsquo;m not too sure how I would 
react to seeing one in a professional kitchen. They seem to be pushing a 
professional line now though (without that god-awful orange handle) with metal 
handles which retail between $100 and $130 depending on where you look.</p> 
<p><b>KYOCERA:</b><br>
A good quality ceramic knife, stays incredibly. As 
noted before, it is fragile. I&rsquo;ve broken a few pairing knives from them 
and have since switched to my current knives. Six-inch is as high as they go, 
and it retails for about $90. Their top-of-the-line extra durable knife with 
extra long-lasting sharpness is $300.</p> 
<p><b>NENOX:</b><br>
My last selection is the knife that I use. It is 
Japanese-made, which is made by the mentioned folding of the carbon-steel to 
make the blade super hard and makes it sharp as well. This blade is also super 
thin, which makes it not a good knife to use for chopping big items like bones 
and the sort (I use a Wusthof for those purposes). These are continuously rated 
the best knives on the market. I hate to admit this, but my chef knife cost me 
about $400 with a discount, meaning you&rsquo;ll probably pay about $450 for 
this knife at home. Most home cooks will never need a knife like this, and many 
chefs neither. This knife requires a lot of care, but this care will be 
rewarded by how amazing this knife is.</p> 
<p>I hope that helps a few people out with their knife choices. The same 
qualities go for any of the other types of knives made by these companies, but 
obviously the prices will be different. If there is anything I can do to help 
anyone in the choice of their knives in the future, please do not hesitate to 
contact me. I have sort of an obsession with kitchen knives.</p>
