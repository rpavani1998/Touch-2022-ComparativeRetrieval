 Whether you're shopping for cutlery knives 
for the first time or choosing to upgrade your current set, these buying tips 
will give you an idea of what to look for in a knife and will hopefully help 
make your purchase a satisfactory one. 
<h3>Single Knife vs a Knife Set</h3>There are often savings to be had buying a 
knife set, rather than buying singles. A set often includes a knife steel and 
handy safe storage - accessories that can add up. Some opt for a budget set and 
then add a professional quality knife or set as the budget allows. This 
strategy gives you all the essentials initially with upgrades to follow. 
Specialty knives such as a Santoku or cheese knife, are not usually included in 
a knife set and must be purchased separately. Since quality construction can 
increase the price considerably, be budget-wise when shopping for these 
essentials; you can always upgrade later.

<h3>Essentials Knives</h3>To be able to pare, cut, slice and dice, you need 
the basic knife essentials which include:
<ul> 
<li>Two sizes of paring knives - to core fruit, peel and slice vegetables and 
other tasks</li> 
<li>A utility knife around 6&quot; long - for slicing meat and vegetables, 
plus various chopping needs, usually with a non-serrated blade edge</li> 
<li>A serrated utility knife - handy for slicing tomatoes </li> 
<li>A bread knife - long serrated blade for slicing bread and buns </li> 
<li>A Chef's knife - has a long sharp blade for slicing meats, dicing, 
chopping.</li> </ul>

<h3>Specialty Knives</h3> <b>Ceramic Knives:</b> <br>
<br>
 Ceramic knives can 
also be considered specialty knives simply because of their different nature, 
since their use and care differs from the traditional steel kitchen knives. 
There's also less choice when it comes to ceramic knives and it's essential 
that you know what you can do with one and how to care for them.<br>

<li>A bread knife - has a long serrated blade for clean, even bread slices or 
for slicing buns. While some would consider a knife bread an essential, others 
choose to forgo this knife entirely</li> 
<li>A Santoku - a versatile knife for chopping, slicing, cutting </li> 
<li>A boning or fillet knife - has a flexible blade to remove meat from bone, 
slice tomatoes, or fillet fish</li> 
<li>A cheese knife - a short wide knife with a cut pattern in the blade, that 
makes it easy to release the cheese when slicing.</li> 
<li>Steak knives - sold as a set, these serrated knives easily slice through 
steak and other tough cuts of meat</li> </ul>

<h3>Knife Blade Construction</h3>Knife construction can impact handling as 
well as durability. Afull tang blade extends from the tip of the blade to the 
end of the handle making the knife stronger. And when the handle is attached to 
the full tang blade by three or more rivets, the knife is considered very 
durable. While you may not notice a difference between a stamped or forged 
blade, a forged blade is sharper and quality-constructed. Hardened steel blades 
are desired for strength and durability.

<h3>Knife Handle Construction</h3>Composite or resin handles are often the 
cheapest and easiest to care for as they can be placed in the dishwasher. 
They're also very durable, while wooden handles though preferred, require more 
care to keep them from drying and cracking. Stainless steel handles are more 
durable but can feel cold in the hand and can become slippery when wet. A 
combination of stainless and non-slip materials is ideal for comfort and 
function. A well defined bolster helps balance the knife. When buying knives, 
take time to handle them to ensure a good fit in your hand which is crucial to 
safe handling.

<h3>Knife Accessories</h3>In order to keep knives in top condition, you need a 
knife sharpener, a knife steel or sharpening stone. Though it requires a little 
practice, sharpening a blade with a knife steel is fairly easy and will restore 
the edge. To keep the blades from pitting/staining, always dry knives 
completely before storing.

<h3>Safe Knife Storage</h3>While you can place sharp knives directly in a 
drawer with other utensils, doing so creates a hazard with a high risk of 
injury. The safest way to store knives is either in a knife block, on a knife 
magnetic strip, in shields or guards, stored in their presentation boxes or in 
a specially designed knife holder. Knife blades will retain their edge longer 
when safely stored.
