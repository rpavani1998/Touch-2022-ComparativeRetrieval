<h1>CHROMA Knives </h1> 
<p><strong><br>
<em>&quot;Made of Pure 301 Steel. Finest Japanese Blade 
Steel&quot;</em></strong></p> 
<p> A VERY unique knife design! What I first saw this I thought they were 
crazy. But then I got two in for evaluation and wow, they work! The handle 
starts out like a regular handle (at the heel of the blade), but as it moves 
away towards the end it flattens out, and this part sits perfectly in the palm 
of your hand. The result is that it's remarkably easy, comfortable and stable 
to hold. As a test I put the santoku and the 9.5&quot; chef's knife in my knife 
block at home but I didn't say anything to my wife. Would she keep using the 
Wusthof or would she even try the Chroma (she's not a knife fanatic like me, 
and not especially interested in trying new gadgets)? Before I knew it I 
noticed her using the santoku almost daily for the usual family meal vegetable 
and chicken chopping -- she finds it comfortable, sharp, and easy to use. She 
won't admit that they look cool too, but I think she secretly likes the sexy 
stainless look. And the prices are reasonable, so why not! I also find them 
quite easy maintain -- they take an edge easily and keep it quite a while.</p> 
<p>Click here to see some comments from professional chefs. </p> 
<p>This is from the Choma literature:<br>
 The advantages Type 301 are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>An ergonomic handle - designed by F.A. Porsche working with the chef of 
the decade, J&ouml;rg W&ouml;rther</li> 
<li>A metal &quot;pearl&quot; that clearly demarcates the end of the handle, 
for better control when cutting</li> 
<li>A seamless perfection and hygienic transition from blade to handle </li> 
<li>A special grinding method is used, so the knife stays sharp longer and is 
easier to sharpen</li> </ul> 
<p>Please note the following instructions to insure the knife remains in 
optimal condition for years to come (these are good instructions to keep in 
mind for ANY good knife):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Never place the knife in the dishwasher. Hand wash and dry after every use.
</li> 
<li>Regularly sharpen the knife using a whetstone or ceramic. A sharpening 
steel is not recommended (note from Paul: I've used a steel on mine; with a 
light touch and minimal swipes, I find it resets the edge just fine.As with any 
good tool, take care with maintenance and don't abuse it. Your mileage my vary.)
</li> 
<li>Store the knife in a safe, secure manner, for example, in a knife block so 
the blade is not left exposed.</li> 
<li>Only use wooden or plastic cutting boards, never marble or glass.</li> 
<li>Only use the knife to prepare food. Do not use it to cut frozen foods, 
bones, or as a utility knife.</li> 
<li>Knives with a serrated blade, such as the bread and tomato knives, should 
only be sharpened by a certified professional.</li> </ul> 
<p>Note: the lengths stated by Chroma are measured from the tip to the metal 
&quot;pearl&quot; -- the actual blade length (from tip to the heel or 
handle-side of the edge) is approx. 1 to 3 cm shorter (1 cm for the paring 
knives, 3 cm for the longer knives).</p> 
<p><strong>Great Gifts! </strong>These knives come in <strong>spectacularly
</strong> beautiful gift boxes! The best-looking boxes and packaging I've 
<strong>EVER</strong> seen for a knife. The boxes are hard cases, with a black 
textured finish outside, and inside the knives are secured in fitted hard foam 
inserts. The whole thing is then packed off in a beautiful colour slip-case. 
Incredible!</p> <br>
