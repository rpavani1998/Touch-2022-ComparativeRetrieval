<p><b>The Brilliant Cut Knife by Lyndey Milan</b></p> 
<p>For the first time in her 25 year career in the food industry, Lyndey has 
put her name to a product. She tested this knife for over 12 months and has 
worked with the Forever Knives' developers and designers to create the only 
knife you'll ever need.</p> 
<p><em>My professional life is focused on empowering the home cook. Too many 
of them have blunt knives because they don't know how to sharpen them. I want 
cooking to be easy and fun. I tested this knife for over 12 months and am very 
proud to put my name to it. I love using it for everything - it doesn't let me 
down, staying sharp much longer than my steel knives &ndash; and that's because 
it contains diamonds &ndash; something every girl loves!</em></p> 
<h4>Tell me about the knife?</h4>
