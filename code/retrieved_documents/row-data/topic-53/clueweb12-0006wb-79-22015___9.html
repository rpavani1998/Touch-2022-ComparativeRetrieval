Ceramic knives are a different breed of knife altogether 
and one that professional chefs love for the long-lasting sharpness and 
superior cutting abilities. We were eager to take ZX Kitchen&trade; Knives for 
a test, to see how handy these ceramic cutlery tools would be in an average 
kitchen.<br>

<h3>How the ZX Kitchen Ceramic Knives Performed</h3>

 At first glance, the workmanship of these knives is quite evident 
and they are anything but typical ceramic. The knives are really beautiful to 
look at, lightweight and very comfortable with soft-feel nonslip handles. The 
ceramic blades are black, so you don't need to worry about discoloration and 
that also makes them stand out from the average ceramic knife.<br>
<br>
 This 
Precision Set (boxed) includes very practical kitchen knives: A 3-1/2&quot; 
paring knife and 5&quot; utility knife. The knife handles are warm and the soft 
feel and shape of these knives make it very easy to control when cutting or 
slicing. If you're new to ceramic, the lighter weight is very noticeable 
compared to steel knives and one might think it would be difficult to control 
such a knife, but not so. A well-designed ceramic knife with a comfortable 
handle is easy to control. The ZX knives also have a safety feature, the shape 
of the handle keeps your fingers away from the blade and the point of the blade 
is blunt.<br>
<br>
 We found the ZX Ceramic 5&quot; Utility Knife most useful 
for slicing ham and boneless meats and cutting vegetables for salads. It slices 
through tomatoes with incredible ease and we were able to get extremely thin 
slices with no effort. These knives are well balanced and allow precise 
cutting. Although the point of the knife is blunt, you can gently slice a 
tomato with ease. The small Paring Knife peels an apple as easily as using a 
peeler and coring apple quarters requires little effort.<br>
<br>
 The best of 
care was given to these ZX Ceramic Knives and that is crucial with any ceramic 
brand. They were not used near bone or with frozen foods, nor were they 
dropped. Knives were always used with either a wooden or plastic cutting board. 
And we used the ZX knives for fruits, vegetables, processed or boneless meats. 
They were also handwashed and dried - something I recommend with any sharp 
knife, and immediately returned to their storage box.<br>
<br>
 I point out 
this special care for two reasons. First because ceramic knives need ultimate 
care and that includes proper storage. By nature, ceramic knives are stronger 
than steel, but are more brittle and can break. Secondly because even with this 
kind of care, the utility knife sustained a small chip about 1.25&quot; from 
the point end, during this test.<br>
<br>
Not noticed immediately, we assumed 
it might have happened when we sliced through hard raw potatoes, turnips or 
carrots. These were the hardest foods and during slicing you could hear the 
blade against the cutting board. There could also have been a little grit on 
the unpeeled potatoes and maybe this caused the ceramic to chip. Whatever the 
cause, it remains a mystery. This was most unfortunate and very disappointing. 
<h3>Overall Impression</h3>  Ceramic knives are very different than steel 
knives in handling as well as function and they should be used only for slicing 
fruits, vegetables and boneless meats. They also require much more care than 
steel knives in terms of use or storage and you cannot sharpen a ceramic knife, 
unless the sharpener is specifically designed for use with this type of knife. 
Ceramic knives would never replace your regular steelkitchen knives, but rather 
enhance your knife selection, providing options for the slicing or cutting task 
at hand.<br>
<br>
 The ZX Kitchen&trade; Ceramic Knives tested offer the 
consumer very comfortable, lightweight and razor-sharp knives for slicing 
fruits, vegetables and boneless meats at comparable prices. I like the feel, 
look, material construction, design and sharpness of these knives. The drop in 
rating is mainly due to the possible durability issue.<br>
<br>
 Here's my 
dilemma in rating this review. Was it user error, an (isolated) defect in this 
particular knife or a lack of knowledge, that caused the Utility Knife to chip 
during testing. By lack of knowledge, I mean these knives are supposed to be 
able to slice vegetables, but is that limited to soft vegetables only? If this 
were the case, it would reduce usage somewhat. In all fairness to this brand 
and without knowing the exact cause of the chip, I gave this review a moderate 
rating. These knives cannot be sharpened with typical knife sharpening tools; 
they must be sharpened by the manufacturer.<br>
<br>
 Confirmation of usage 
will be requested from the manufacturer and comments posted. In order to help 
consumers make the right knife buying choices, I will add any updates or 
comments to this review. I'd also love to see other consumer reviews on these 
ZX Knives; a short review can be added to this page. ZX does offer a lifetime 
warranty on their knives.<br>

<b>Update - Response received from ZX 
Kitchen Knives:</b> <br>
 &ldquo;We so appreciate Mariette&rsquo;s review of zx 
kitchen&rsquo;s black ceramic knives. zx kitchen&trade; has sold thousands of 
knives since we launched the company in 2011, and we have received overwhelming 
praise for the quality and durability of our products. We hope to make zx 
kitchen the next revolution in food preparation. Sharper than traditional steel 
cutlery, our ceramic knives slice flawlessly for five years with no need for 
re-sharpening. We would love for Mariette to try our steak knives, as slicing 
meats has never been easier. Because they are ceramic, in the rare occasion 
that one of our products does not live up to the standards of our customers or 
accidentally chips due to normal wear and tear, we will always send a 
replacement or offer a full refund.&quot; by zx kitchen CEO George Marks<br>

<br> <b>My thoughts</b>: I was very glad to receive the above response from the 
manufacturer. ZX Kitchen obviously stands by its products.
