 I.WHAT MAKES A STEEL PERFORM? <br>
<br>
 A. Introduction 
<br> <br>
 Steel is the heart of the blade. The search for higher-performance 
<br> steels has to a number of wonderful materials in recent years. Steel <br>
 
by itself isn't the sole determiner of knife performance, of course.<br>
 Heat 
treatment, blade geometry, handle geometry and materials all<br>
 effect how a 
knife performs for a particular job. However, those<br>
 other qualities can be 
difficult to measure. You can't tell by<br>
 looking at it how well a blade has 
been heat-treated, and you can only<br>
 make educated guesses on how well the 
blade and handle geometry will<br>
 work. With steel, however, you can get a 
full listing of its alloying<br>
 elements, something measureable and somehow 
satisfying.<br>
<br>
 As a result, it's easy to fall into the trap of putting 
too much<br>
 emphasis on the steel itself. A knife is more than steel, and it's
<br> important not to forget that. In addition, many modern steels perform <br>

 so well, that knife decisions can often be made based on other factors<br>
 
than marginal increases in steel performance.<br>
<br>
 The question of 
&quot;what's the best steel&quot; or &quot;rank the following steels<br>
 in 
order from best to worst&quot; often comes up. The resulting replies<br>
 can 
never be totally accurate, because depending on the jobs the knife<br>
 will be 
used for, the blade geometry, and the quality of the heat<br>
 treat, what is 
&quot;best&quot; and what is &quot;worst&quot; can be very fluid. If you<br>
 
want to make an educated decision about steels, try to learn the<br>
 basics of 
steel properties, and go from there.<br>
<br>
 B. Sharpening for performance 
<br> <br>
 That doesn't mean that significant performance advantages can't be 
had<br>
 by choosing the right steel for the job. In fact, choosing a steel <br>
 can significantly impact the performance of a knife. But, to really<br>
 bring 
out the performance of a particular steel, you need to take<br>
 advantage of 
the better steel in your sharpening plan. If a weak,<br>
 brittle steel can 
perform the job when sharpened at<br>
 25-degrees-per-side, a strong, tough 
steel might give you some<br>
 marginal performance improvements if it, too, is 
sharpened at<br>
 25-degrees-per-side. However, to really bring out the 
performance of<br>
 the better steel, trying bringing it down to 20-degrees per 
side, or<br>
 less. The advantage of the better steel is that it is strong and 
<br> tough enough to hold up with a small edge angle -- and smaller edge <br>
 
angles radically out-perform bigger edge angles. It's easy to get a<br>
 
10-to-1 perform advantage for certain cutting jobs by cutting 5<br>
 degrees 
off your sharpening angle.<br>
<br>
 This leads to the general rule: <br>
<br>
 
To really see the advantages of a better steel, exploit that<br>
 steel in your 
sharpening program. If you're going to sharpen<br>
 all your knives at the same 
angle regardless of steel, you<br>
 might de-emphasize steel choice somewhat. 
<br> <br>
 On the internet, I'll often see someone posting about wanting to <br>
 upgrade from their ATS-34 folder to one that has S30V, and then in a<br>
 
different post, declare that they sharpen all their knives at<br>
 
20-degrees-per-side. Why spend all that extra money for S30V, just to<br>
 get 
some marginal wear resistance advantages but no other performance<br>
 
advantages? If that same user would take advantage of S30V's superior<br>
 
toughness and drop the edge angle to 15-degrees-per-side, they would<br>
 see a 
large leap in cutting performance, along with the extra wear<br>
 resistance. 
Because of choosing the right sharpening angle, the more<br>
 expensive S30V 
knife now gives an impressive return on investment.<br>
 *Now* you can see what 
all the fuss is about!<br>
<br>
 C. Design for performance <br>
<br>
 In the 
section above, we highlighted what the user can do to bring out<br>
 the best 
performance in a high-performance steel. But the user is<br>
 only half the 
equation; now we will look at what the knifemaker might<br>
 do with a higher- 
performance steel. As the knifemaker moves from one<br>
 steel to another, it 
is often possible to modify the design of a<br>
 particular knife to take 
advantage of the newer steel, and raise<br>
 performance. <br>
<br>
 For 
example, it is possible to make a hard-use &quot;tactical/utility&quot;<br>
 
knife from ATS-34. To make sure the ATS-34 will take the kind of<br>
 stresses 
it might see in this environment, the edge might be left a<br>
 bit thick 
(sacrificing cutting performance), or the hardness brought<br>
 down a touch 
(sacrificing strength and wear resistance), or both. If<br>
 the same maker 
moves to much-tougher S30V, he might be able to thin<br>
 out the edge, thin 
out the entire knife, and raise the hardness,<br>
 bringing up performance as a 
whole. Moving to differentially-tempered<br>
 5160 might allow the maker to 
re-profile even more for performance.<br>
 If we're talking about a fighter, 
moving from 1095 to 3V might allow<br>
 the maker to make the knife much 
thinner, lighter, and faster, while<br>
 significantly increasing cutting 
performance and maintaining edge<br>
 integrity. <br>
<br>
 So to really take 
advantage of the higher-performance steel, we want<br>
 the knifemaker to 
adjust the knife design to the steel, wherever he<br>
 thinks it's appropriate. 
If a knifemaker offers the same knife in<br>
 multiple steels, ask about what 
the characteristics are in each steel,<br>
 and the how's and why's of where 
the design has changed to accomodate<br>
 each steel offered. <br>
<br>
 Note 
that there can be good reasons that a knifemaker might not change<br>
 the 
blade profile even though the steel has changed. Maybe he's<br>
 particularly 
good at heat-treating one steel or another, so that the<br>
 differences 
between disparate steels are minimized. Maybe the<br>
 higher-performance steel 
is not available in the next stock thickness<br>
 down. Maybe instead of higher 
cutting performance, the maker would<br>
 rather offer the same cutting 
performance but in a knife that can take<br>
 more abuse. Maybe his customers 
tend to only buy thicker knives<br>
 regardless of performance. <br>
<br>
 So 
work with the maker to understand the choices being made with the<br>
 
different steels being offered. If you understand the kind of<br>
 performance 
you need, you'll be able to make a wise choice.<br>
<br>
 D. Properties of 
performance steels<br>
<br>
 What is it we're looking for in a steel, anyway? 
Well, what we are<br>
 looking for is strength, toughness, wear resistance, and 
edge<br>
 holding. Sometimes, we're also looking for stain resistance. <br>
<br>
 Wear resistance: Just like it sounds, wear resistance is the ability<br>
 to 
withstand abrasion. Generally speaking, the amount, type, and<br>
 distribution 
of carbides within the steel is what determines wear<br>
 resistance. <br>
<br>

 Strength: The ability to take a load without permanently<br>
 deforming. For 
many types of jobs, strength is extremely important.<br>
 Any time something 
hard is being cut, or there's lateral stress put on<br>
 the edge, strength 
becomes a critical factor. In steels, strength is<br>
 directly correlated with 
hardness -- the harder the steel, the<br>
 stronger it is. Note that with the 
Rockwell test used to measure<br>
 hardness in a steel, it is the hardness of 
the steel matrix being<br>
 measured, not the carbides. This, it's possible for 
a softer, weaker<br>
 steel (measuring low on the Rockwell scale) to have more 
wear<br>
 resistance than a harder steel. S60V, even at 56 Rc, still has more 
<br> and harder carbides than ATS-34 at 60 Rc, and thus the S60V is more <br>
 
wear resistant, while the ATS-34 would be stronger.<br>
<br>
 Toughness: The 
ability to take an impact without damage, by which we<br>
 mean, chipping, 
cracking, etc. Toughness is obviously important in<br>
 jobs such as chopping, 
but it's also important any time the blade hits<br>
 harder impurities in a 
material being cut (e.g., cardboard, which<br>
 often has embedded impurities). 
<br> <br>
 The knifemaker will be making a tradeoff of strength versus 
toughness.<br>
 Generally speaking, within the hardness range that the steel 
performs<br>
 well at, as hardness increases, strength also increases, but 
toughness<br>
 decreases. This is not always strictly true, but as a rule of 
thumb<br>
 is generally accurate. In addition, it is possible for different heat
<br> treat formulas to leave the steel at the same hardness, but with <br>
 
properties such as toughness, wear resistance, and stain resistance<br>
 
significantly differing.<br>
<br>
 Stain resistance (rust resistance): The 
ability to withstand rust<br>
 (oxidation). Obviously, this property can be 
helpful in corrosive<br>
 environments, such as salt water. In addition, some 
types of<br>
 materials are acidic (e.g., some types of foods), and 
micro-oxidation<br>
 can lead to edge loss at the very tip of the edge, over a 
small amount<br>
 of time. In &quot;stainless&quot; cutlery steels, stain 
resistance is most<br>
 affected by free chromium -- that is, chromium that is 
not tied up in<br>
 carbides. So, the more chromium tied up in carbides, the 
less free<br>
 chromium there is, which means more wear resistance but less 
stain<br>
 resistance. <br>
<br>
 Edge holding: The ability of a blade to hold 
an edge. Many people<br>
 make the mistake of thinking wear resistance and edge 
holding are the<br>
 same thing. Most assuredly, it is not; or rather, it 
usually is not.<br>
 Edge holding is job-specific. That is, edge holding is a 
function of<br>
 wear resistance, strength, and toughness. But different jobs 
require<br>
 different properties for edge holding. For example, cutting through
<br> cardboard (which often has hard embedded impurities), toughness <br>
 
becomes extremely important, because micro-chipping is often the<br>
 reason 
for edge degradation. Whittling very hard wood, strength<br>
 becomes very 
important for edge-holding, because the primary reason<br>
 for edge 
degradation is edge rolling and impaction. Wear resistance<br>
 becomes more 
important for edge holding when very abrasive materials,<br>
 such as carpet, 
are being cut. And for many jobs, where corrosion-<br>
 inducing materials are 
contacted (such as food prep), corrosion can<br>
 affect the edge quickly, so 
corrosion resistance has a role to play<br>
 as well. <br>
<br>
 There are 
other properties that significantly effect how a steel<br>
 performs: <br>
<br>

 Ability to take an edge: Some steels just seem to take a much sharper<br>
 
edge than other steels, even if sharpened the exact same way.<br>
 
Finer-grained steels just seem to get scary sharp much more easily<br>
 than 
coarse-grained steels, and this can definitely effect<br>
 performance. Adding 
a bit of vanadium is an easy way to get a<br>
 fine-grained steels. In 
addition, an objective of the forging process<br>
 is to end up with a 
finer-grained steel. So both steel choice, and<br>
 the way that steel is 
handled, can effect cutting performance.<br>
<br>
 Manufacturing process: 
Cleaner, purer steels perform better than<br>
 dirtier, impure steels. The 
cleaner steel will often be stronger and<br>
 tougher, having less inclusions. 
High quality processes used to<br>
 manufacture performance steel include the 
Argon/Oxygen/Decarburization<br>
 (AOD) process, and for even purer steel, the 
Vacuum Induction<br>
 Melting/Vacuum Arc Remelting (VIM/VAR) process, often 
referred to as<br>
 &quot;double vacuum melting&quot; or &quot;vacuum 
re-melting&quot;.<br>
<br>
 Edge toothiness: Some steels seem to cut 
aggressively even when razor<br>
 polished. For these steels, even when they're 
polished for<br>
 push-cutting, their carbides form a kind of &quot;micro 
serrations&quot; and<br>
 slice aggressively. <br>
<br>
 E. What's the 
&quot;best steel&quot;.<br>
<br>
 Understanding these properties will get you 
started to fundamentally<br>
 understanding steels and how choice of steel can 
effect performance.<br>
 I often see people asking, &quot;what's the best 
steel&quot;? Well, the answer<br>
 depends so much on what the steel is being 
used for, and how it's<br>
 heat-treated, that the questioner can never 
possibly get an accurate<br>
 answer. For a knife lover, it's worth spending a 
little time<br>
 understanding steel properties -- only by doing so well he 
really<br>
 understand what the &quot;best steel&quot; might be for his 
application.<br>
<br>
 Putting it all together, you can see how these 
properties might<br>
 determine your steel choice. To pick on S60V and ATS-34 
again, there<br>
 seems to be a feeling that S60V is &quot;better&quot; in some 
absolute sense<br>
 than ATS-34. But S60V is often left very soft, around 55-56 
Rc, to<br>
 make up for a lack of toughness. Even left that soft, an abundance 
of<br>
 well-distributed vanadium carbides gives S60V superior wear resistance 
<br> to ATS-34, at acceptable toughness levels. However, does that mean <br>
 
S60V is &quot;better&quot; than ATS-34? Well, many users will find edge rolling
<br> and impaction the primary causes of edge degradation for everyday use. <br>
 For those users, even though S60V is more wear-resistant, S60V is also<br>
 so 
soft and weak that they will actually see better edge retention<br>
 with 
ATS-34! The S60V user can leave the edge more obtuse (raise the<br>
 sharpening 
angle) to put more metal behind the edge to make it more<br>
 robust, but now 
the S60V will suffer serious cutting performance<br>
 disadvantages versus the 
thinner ATS-34 edge.<br>
<br>
 So, the next general rule: <br>
<br>
 Knowing 
the uses you'll put your knife to, and exactly how<br>
 those uses cause edge 
degradation, will allow you to make a<br>
 much better choice of steel, if you 
generally understand steel<br>
 properties. <br>
<br>
 The properties of 
different steels will be laid out below. But in<br>
 your search for the knife 
with the &quot;best steel&quot; for your uses, I<br>
 always suggest you ask 
the makers of the knives you're considering<br>
 which steels they would use. 
The knifemaker will usually know which<br>
 steels he can make perform the 
best. And as pointed out above, heat<br>
 treat is absolutely critical to 
bringing out the best in a steel. A<br>
 maker who has really mastered one 
particular steel (e.g., Dozier and<br>
 D-2) might be able to make that steel 
work well for many different<br>
 uses. So never go just by charts and 
properties; make sure you also<br>
 consider what the knifemaker can do with 
the steel.</blockquote> <br>

<blockquote> III. ELEMENTS OF STEEL <br>
<br>
 At its most simple, steel is 
iron with carbon in it. Other alloys are<br>
 added to make the steel perform 
differently. Here are the important<br>
 steel alloys in alphabetical order, 
and some sample steels that<br>
 contain those alloys: <br>
<br>
 Carbon: 
Present in all steels, it is the most important hardening<br>
 element. Also 
increases the strength of the steel but,<br>
 added in isolation, decreases 
toughness. We<br>
 usually want knife-grade steel to have &gt;.5% carbon, which 
<br> makes it &quot;high-carbon&quot; steel. <br>
 Chromium: Added for wear 
resistance, hardenability, and (most<br>
 importantly) for corrosion 
resistance. A steel with at least<br>
 13% chromium is typically deemed 
&quot;stainless&quot; steel, though<br>
 another definition says the steel must 
have at least 11.5%<br>
 *free* chromium (as opposed to being tied up in 
carbides) to<br>
 be considered &quot;stainless&quot;. Despite the name, all 
steel can<br>
 rust if not maintained properly. Adding chromium in high <br>
 
amounts decreases toughness. Chromium is a carbide-former,<br>
 which is why it 
increases wear resistance.<br>
 Manganese: An important element, manganese aids 
the grain structure,<br>
 and contributes to hardenability. Also strength &amp; 
<br> wear resistance. Improves the steel (e.g., deoxidizes) during <br>
 the 
steel's manufacturing (hot working and rolling). Present<br>
 in most cutlery 
steel except for A-2, L-6, and CPM 420V.<br>
 Molybdenum: A carbide former, 
prevents brittleness &amp; maintains<br>
 the steel's strength at high 
temperatures. Present in<br>
 many steels, and air-hardening steels (e.g., A-2, 
ATS-34)<br>
 always have 1% or more molybdenum -- molybdenum is what gives <br>

 those steels the ability to harden in air.<br>
 Nickel: Adds toughness. 
Present in<br>
 L-6 and AUS-6 and AUS-8. Nickel is widely believed to <br>
 
play a role in corrosion resistance as well, but this<br>
 is probably 
incorrect.<br>
 Phosphorus: Present in small amounts in most steels, phosphorus 
is<br>
 a essentially a contaminent which reduces toughness. <br>
 Silicon: 
Contributes to strength. Like manganese, it makes the steel<br>
 more sound 
while it's being manufactured.<br>
 Sulfur: Typically not desireable in cutlery 
steel, sulfur increases<br>
 machinability but decreases toughness. <br>
 
Tungsten: A carbide former, it increases wear resistance. When<br>
 combined 
properly with chromium or molybdenum, tungsten will<br>
 make the steel to be a 
high-speed steel. The high-speed steel<br>
 M-2 has a high amount of tungsten. 
The strongest carbide<br>
 former behind vanadium. <br>
 Vanadium: Contributes 
to wear resistance and hardenability, and as<br>
 a carbide former (in fact, 
vanadium carbides are the hardest<br>
 carbides) it contribute to wear 
resistance. It also refines the<br>
 grain of the steel, which contributes to 
toughness and<br>
 allows the blade to take a very sharp edge. A number <br>
 
of steels have vanadium, but M-2, Vascowear, and CPM T440V and<br>
 420V (in 
order of increasing amounts) have high amounts of<br>
 vanadium. BG-42's 
biggest difference with ATS-34 is the<br>
 addition of vanadium. <br>
<br>
<br>

 IV. STEELS<br>
<br>
 A. Non-stainless Steels (carbon, alloy, and tool steels): 
<br> <br>
 These steels are the steels most often forged. Stainless steels can 
<br> be forged (guys like Sean McWilliams do forge stainless), but it is <br>
 
very difficult. In addition, carbon steels can be differentially<br>
 tempered, 
to give a hard edge-holding edge and a tough springy back.<br>
 Stainless 
steels are not differentially tempered. Of course, carbon<br>
 steels will rust 
faster than stainless steels, to varying degrees.<br>
 Carbon steels are also 
often a little bit less of a crap shoot than<br>
 stainless steels -- I believe 
all the steels named below are fine<br>
 performers when heat treated properly. 
<br> <br>
 In the AISI steel designation system, 10xx is carbon steel, any other
<br> steels are alloy steels. For example, the 50xx series are chromium <br>
 
steels.<br>
<br>
 In the SAE designation system, steels with letter 
designations (e.g.,<br>
 W-2, A-2) are tool steels. <br>
<br>
 There is an ASM 
classification system as well, but it isn't seen often<br>
 in the discussion 
of cutlery steels, so I'll ignore it for now.<br>
<br>
 Often, the last numbers 
in the name of a steel are fairly close to the<br>
 steel's carbon content. So 
1095 is ~.95% carbon. 52100 is ~1.0%<br>
 carbon. 5160 is ~.60% carbon. <br>

<br> D-2 <br>
 D-2 is sometimes called a &quot;semi-stainless&quot;. It has a 
fairly high<br>
 chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as 
stainless.<br>
 It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels mentioned 
above,<br>
 however. It has excellent wear resistance. D-2 is much tougher than 
<br> the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of <br>

 the other non-stainless steels mentioned here. The combination of<br>
 great 
wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make<br>
 it a great 
choice for a number of knife styles. Bob Dozier is one<br>
 maker who uses D-2. 
Benchmade has begun using D-2 in its Axis AFCK.<br>
<br>
 M-2 <br>
 A 
&quot;high-speed steel&quot;, it can hold its temper even at very high<br>
 
temperatures, and as such is used in industry for high-heat cutting<br>
 jobs. 
It is slightly tougher, and is slightly more wear resistant,<br>
 than D-2. 
However, M-2 rusts easily. Benchmade has started using M-2<br>
 in one of their 
AFCK 710 variations.<br>
<br>
 A-2 <br>
 An excellent air-hardening tool steel, 
it is tougher than D-2 and M-2,<br>
 with less wear resistance . As an 
air-hardening steel, don't expect<br>
 it to be differentially tempered. Its 
good toughness makes it a<br>
 frequent choice for combat knives. Chris Reeve 
and Phil Hartsfield<br>
 both use A-2. <br>
<br>
 O-1 <br>
 This is a steel 
very popular with forgers, as it has the reputation<br>
 for being 
&quot;forgiving&quot;. It is an excellent steel, that takes and holds<br>
 an 
edge superbly, and is tough (although not as tough as, say, 5160).<br>
 It 
rusts easily, however. Randall Knives uses O-1, so does Mad Dog<br>
 Knives. 
<br> <br>
 W-2 <br>
 Reasonably tough and holds an edge well, due to its .2% 
vanadium<br>
 content. Most files are made from W-1, which is the same as W-2 
<br> except for the vanadium content (W-1 has no vanadium). <br>
<br>
 The 
10-series -- 1095 (and 1084, 1070, 1060, 1050, etc.) Many of the<br>
 10-series 
steels for cutlery, though 1095 is the most popular for<br>
 knives. When you 
go in order from 1095-1050, you generally go from<br>
 more carbon to less, 
from more wear resistance to less wear<br>
 resistance, and tough to tougher to 
toughest. As such, you'll see<br>
 1060 and 1050, used often for swords. For 
knives, 1095 is sort of the<br>
 &quot;standard&quot; carbon steel, not too 
expensive and performs well. It is<br>
 reasonably tough and holds an edge 
well, and is easy to sharpen. It<br>
 rusts easily. This is a simple steel, 
which contains only two<br>
 alloying elements: .95% carbon and .4% manganese. 
The various kabars<br>
 are usually 1095 with a black coating. <br>
<br>
 
Carbon V<br>
 Carbon V is a trademarked term by Cold Steel, and as such is not 
<br> necessarily one particular kind of steel; rather, it describes <br>
 
whatever steel Cold Steel happens to be using, and there is an<br>
 indication 
they do change steels from time to time. Carbon V performs<br>
 roughly between 
1095-ish and O-1-ish, in my opinion, and rusts like<br>
 O-1 as well. I've 
heard rumors that Carbon V is O-1 (which I think is<br>
 unlikely) or 1095. 
Numerous industry insiders insist it is 0170-6.<br>
 Some spark tests done by a 
rec.knives reader seem to point the finger<br>
 at 50100-B. Since 50100-B and 
0170-6 are the same steel (see below),<br>
 this is likely the current Carbon V.
<br> <br>
 0170-6 - 50100-B <br>
 These are different designations for the same 
steel: 0170-6 is the<br>
 steel makers classification, 50100-B is the AISI 
designation. A good<br>
 chrome-vanadium steel that is somewhat similar to O-1, 
but much less<br>
 expensive. The now-defunct Blackjack made several knives 
from O170-6,<br>
 and Carbon V may be 0170-6. 50100 is basically 52100 with 
about 1/3<br>
 the chromium of 52100, and the B in 50100-B indicates that the 
steel<br>
 has been modified with vanadium, making this a chrome-vanadium steel.
<br> <br>
 L-6 <br>
 A band saw steel that is very tough and holds an edge 
well, but rusts<br>
 easily. It is, like O-1, a forgiving steel for the forger. 
If you're<br>
 willing to put up with the maintenance, this may be one of the 
very<br>
 best steels available for cutlery, especially where toughness is <br>

 desired. In a poll on the knifemakers email list back in the 1990s,<br>
 when 
asked what the makers would use for their personal knife, L-6<br>
 emerged as 
the top choice.<br>
<br>
 5160 <br>
 A steel popular with forgers, it is 
popular now for a variety of knife<br>
 styles, but usually bigger blades that 
need more toughness. It is<br>
 essentially a simple spring steel with chromium 
added for<br>
 hardenability. It has good wear resistance, but is known 
especially<br>
 for its outstanding toughness. This steel performs well over a 
wide<br>
 range of hardnesses, showing great toughess when hardened in the low 
<br> 50s Rc for swords, and hardened up near the 60s for knives needing <br>
 
more edge holding.<br>
<br>
 52100 <br>
 Formerly a ball-bearing steel, and as 
such previously only used by<br>
 forgers, it's available in bar stock now. It 
is similar to 5160<br>
 (though it has around 1% carbon vs. 5160 ~.60%), but 
holds an edge<br>
 better. It is less tough than 5160. It is used often for 
hunting<br>
 knives and other knives where the user is willing to trade off a 
<br> little of 5160's toughness for better wear resistance. However, with <br>
 
the continued improvement of 52100 heat treat, this steel is starting<br>
 to 
show up in larger knives and showing excellent toughness. A<br>
 modified 52100 
is being used by Jerry Busse in his lower-cost<br>
 production line, and such 
high-performance knife luminaries as Ed<br>
 Fowler strongly favor 52100. <br>

<br> CPM 10V <br>
 Crucible's somewhat-stain-resistant 10V provides incredible 
wear<br>
 resistance with D-2-class toughness. It is an oustanding choice when 
<br> maximum wear resistance is desired, but not super toughness. <br>
<br>
 
CPM 3V<br>
 CPM's incredibly tough 3V gives excellent wear resistance and good 
<br> stain resistance as well, although when it does stain, it is said to <br>
 
pit rather than surface rust. When maximum toughness is desired, with<br>
 very 
good wear resistance, 3V is a great choice.<br>
<br>
 INFI <br>
 INFI is 
currently only used by Jerry Busse. In place of some of the<br>
 carbon (INFI 
contains .5% carbon), INFI has nitrogen. The result is a<br>
 non-stainless 
steel that is nevertheless extremely stain resistant<br>
 (informally reported 
at close to D-2, or even better), incredibly<br>
 tough for a high-alloy ingot 
steel, and with extremely good wear<br>
 resistance. <br>
<br>
 Vascowear <br>
 
A very hard-to-find steel, with a high vanadium content. It is<br>
 extremely 
difficult to work and very wear-resistant. It is out of<br>
 production.

<blockquote> B. Stainless Steels <br>
 Remember that all steels can rust. But 
the following steels, by<br>
 virtue of their &gt; 13% chromium, have much more 
rust resistance than<br>
 the above steels. I should point out that there 
doesn't appear to be<br>
 consensus on what percent of chromium is needed for a 
steel to be<br>
 considered stainless. In the cutlery industry, the de-facto 
standard<br>
 is 13%, but the ASM Metals Handbooks says &quot;greater than 
10%&quot;, and<br>
 other books cite other numbers. It probably makes more 
sense to<br>
 measure stainlessness byt he amount of free chromium (chromium not
<br> tied up in carbides), because free chromium is what forms the chromium <br>
 oxide on the blade surface that offers stain resistance. The alloying<br>
 
elements have a strong influence on the amount of chromium needed;<br>
 lower 
chromium with the right alloying elements can still have<br>
 
&quot;stainless&quot; performance.<br>
<br>
 Because any particular stainless 
steel is often heat treated to around<br>
 the same hardness (i.e., 440C is 
usually around 57 Rc, ATS-34 is 59-61<br>
 Rc, S60V is getting consensus at 
around 56 Rc, etc.) even by different<br>
 manufacturers, it's a bit easier to 
give a general feeling of the<br>
 performance you'll get from different 
classes of stainless steels,<br>
 without introducing too many inaccuracies. 
Please note, though, that<br>
 the act of grouping differing steels in classes 
definitely does<br>
 oversimplify, and some of these steels might more properly 
fit between<br>
 the class it's in, and the following (or previous) one. In 
addition,<br>
 better heat treat can move a steel up in performance 
significantly.<br>
 Last disclaimer: not everyone will agree with the groupings 
I have<br>
 here. Whew, all that said, here is a general categorization of <br>

 stainless steels:<br>
<br>
 420 and 420J represent the low end of stainless 
steels. They are very<br>
 stain resistant, and are tough due to being very 
soft. However, they<br>
 are also very weak, and not very wear resistant. 
Generally speaking,<br>
 expect these steels to lose their edge quickly through 
abrasion and<br>
 impaction. They are used in less-expensive knives due to 
their ease<br>
 of machining. <br>
<br>
 440A and its relative peers, 425M, 
420HC, 12C27, and 6A are the next<br>
 group. They can be hardened more than 
the previous group, for better<br>
 strength, and they are more wear resistant, 
though wear resistance is<br>
 just getting to the point of acceptability. 440A 
and 12C27 are the<br>
 leaders of this group, with solid heat treat both 
perform okay. 12C27<br>
 is said to be particularly pure and can perform very 
well when heat<br>
 treated properly. 6A trails those two steels, though with 
its<br>
 vanadium content, can take a razor edge. 425M and 420HC trail the <br>

 rest, though the highest-carbon versions of 420HC may compete with<br>
 next 
group.<br>
<br>
 Gin-1, ATS-55, 8A, and 440C comprise the next group. These 
steels<br>
 will usually be stronger than the previous group, and more <br>
 
wear-resistant. Generally speaking, they retain excellent stain<br>
 resistance 
properties, though ATS-55 sticks out here as not<br>
 particularly stain 
resistant. 8A is also worth a mention, with some<br>
 vanadium content, it can 
take an extremely sharp edge very easily, but<br>
 is also the weakest and 
least wear-resistant of this group.<br>
<br>
 ATS-34/154CM, VG-10, and S60V are 
the next group up. It's difficult<br>
 to make generalizations about ATS-34 and 
154-CM -- they are in such<br>
 widespread use that heat treat varies widely. 
These steels provide a<br>
 high-end performance benchmark for stainless 
steels, and hold an edge<br>
 well, and are tough enough for many uses (though 
not on par with good<br>
 non-stainlesses). They aren't very stain resistant, 
however. VG-10<br>
 can be thought of as being like ATS-34 and 154-CM, but 
doing just<br>
 about everything a hair better. It's a little more stain 
resistant,<br>
 tougher, holds an edge a little better. And VG-10 has vanadium 
in it,<br>
 it's fine-grained and takes the best edge of this group. S60V has by
<br> far the best wear resistance of the group, though consensus is <br>
 
becoming that it should be left around the same hardness as 440C<br>
 (56ish 
Rc), which means it will be relatively weak compared to ATS-34,<br>
 154-CM, 
and VG-10, and so it will indent and lose its edge quickly<br>
 when strength 
is required. S60V is the winner here when pure<br>
 abrasion resistance is much 
more important than edge strength.<br>
<br>
 BG-42, S90V, and S30V constitute 
the next group. BG-42 has better<br>
 wear resistance than all the previous 
steels except for S60V. It is<br>
 tougher than ATS-34, and more stain 
resistant. It is wear resistant<br>
 to the point where it can be difficult to 
sharpen. S90V represents<br>
 the ultimate in wear resistance in the steels 
discussed so far. Also<br>
 tougher than ATS-34, and more stain resistant. It 
can be very<br>
 difficult to put an edge on. It is difficult enough to machine 
than<br>
 it is used almost exclusively in custom knives, not production <br>
 
knives. In your buying decisions, you might want to take into account<br>
 the 
difficulty of sharpening these steels. S30V backs off on the wear<br>
 
resistance of S90V, but is significantly tougher and easier to<br>
 sharpen. It 
is more wear resistant than BG-42. But, both BG-42 and<br>
 S90V get a bit 
harder (and stronger) than S30V. The jury is still<br>
 out, but it may end up 
this week's ultimate high-end all-around<br>
 stainless steel, due to high 
performance coupled with easier<br>
 machineability and sharpenability than the 
other steels in this class.<br>
<br>
 Okay, on to the steels in more detail: 
<br> <br>
 420 <br>
 Lower carbon content (&lt;.5%) than the 440 series makes 
this steel<br>
 extremely soft, and it doesn't hold an edge well. It is used 
often<br>
 for diving knives, as it is extremely stain resistant. Also used <br>
 often for very inexpensive knives. Outside salt water use, it is too<br>
 soft 
to be a good choice for a utility knife.<br>
<br>
 420HC <br>
 420 modified 
with more carbon, to be roughly comparable to 440A.<br>
<br>
 440 A - 440 B - 
440C<br>
 The carbon content (and hardenability) of this stainless steel goes up
<br> in order from A (.75%) to B (.9%) to C (1.2%). 440C is an excellent, <br>
 
high-end stainless steel, usually hardened to around 56-58 Rc, very<br>
 tough 
and with good edge-holding at that hardness. 440C was the king<br>
 of 
stainless cutlery steels in the 1980s, before ATS-34 took the title<br>
 in the 
1990s. All three resist rust well, with 440A being the most<br>
 rust 
resistant, and 440C the least. The SOG Seal 2000 is 440A, and<br>
 Randall uses 
440B for their stainless knives. 440C is fairly<br>
 ubiquitous, and is 
generally considered a very good general-use<br>
 stainless, tougher and more 
stain resistant than ATS-34 but with less<br>
 edge-holding and weaker. If your 
knife is marked with just &quot;440&quot;, it<br>
 is probably the less 
expensive 440A; if a manufacturer had used the<br>
 more expensive 440C, he'd 
want to advertise that. The general feeling<br>
 is that 440A (and similar 
steels, see below) is just good enough for<br>
 everyday use, especially with a 
good heat treat (we've heard good<br>
 reports on the heat treat of SOG's 440A 
blades, don't know who does<br>
 the work for them). 440-B is a very solid 
performer and 440-C is<br>
 excellent. <br>
<br>
 425M - 12C27 <br>
 Both are 
very similar to 440A. 425M (.5% carbon) is used by Buck<br>
 knives. 12C27 (.6% 
carbon) is a Scandanavian steel used often in<br>
 Finish puukkos and Norwegian 
knives. 12C27 is said to perform very<br>
 well when carefully heat treated, 
due to its high purity. When done<br>
 right, it may be a slighter better 
choice than 440A and its ilk.<br>
<br>
 AUS-6 - AUS-8 - AUS-10 (aka 6A 8A 10A) 
<br> Japanese stainless steels, roughly comparable in carbon content to <br>
 
440A (AUS-6, .65% carbon) and 440B (AUS-8, .75% carbon) and 440C<br>
 (AUS-10, 
1.1% carbon). AUS-6 is used by Al Mar, and is a competitor<br>
 to low-end 
steels like 420J. Cold Steel's use of AUS-8 has made it<br>
 pretty popular, as 
heat treated by CS it won't hold an edge like<br>
 ATS-34, but is a bit softer 
(and therefore weaker) and tougher. 8A is<br>
 a competitor of middle-tier 
steels like ATS-55 and Gin-1. AUS-10 has<br>
 roughly the same carbon content 
as 440C but with slightly less<br>
 chromium, so it should be a bit less rust 
resistant but perhaps a bit<br>
 tougher than 440C. It competes with higher-end 
steels, like ATS-34<br>
 and above. All 3 steels have some vanadium added 
(which the 440<br>
 series lacks), which will improve wear resistance and 
refines the<br>
 grain for both good toughness, and the ability to sharpen to a 
very<br>
 keen edge. Many people have reported that they are able to get knives 
<br> using steels that include vanadium, like 8A, sharper than they can get <br>
 non-vanadium steels like ATS-34.<br>
<br>
 GIN-1 aka G-2 <br>
 A steel with 
slightly less carbon, slightly more chromium, and much<br>
 less moly than 
ATS-34, it used to be used often by Spyderco in their<br>
 less-expensive 
knives. Spyderco has since switched to ATS-55 and 8A,<br>
 but Benchmade is now 
using Gin-1 in their less-expensive knives. A<br>
 very good stainless steel, 
with a bit less wear resistance and strength<br>
 than ATS-34. <br>
<br>
 
ATS-34 - 154-CM<br>
 ATS-34 was the hottest high-end stainless in the 1990s. 
154-CM<br>
 is the original American version, but for a long time was not <br>
 
manufactured to the high quality standards knifemakers expect, so<br>
 
knifemakers switched over to ATS-34. CPM is again making high-quality<br>
 
154-CM, and some companies seeking to stick with American-made<br>
 products 
(like Microtech) are using it. ATS-34 is a Hitachi product<br>
 that is very, 
very similar to 154-CM. Normally hardened to around 60<br>
 Rc, it holds an 
edge very well and is tough enough even at that high<br>
 hardness. Not as rust 
resistant as the 400 series above. Many custom<br>
 makers use ATS-34, and 
Spyderco (in their high-end knives) and<br>
 Benchmade are among the production 
companies that use it.<br>
 Contrary to popular belief, both steels are 
manufactured through<br>
 the Argon/Oxygen/Decarburization process (AOD), not 
vacuum<br>
 remelted. <br>
<br>
 ATS-55 <br>
 Similar to ATS-34, but with the 
moly removed and some other<br>
 elements added. This steel is a good cutlery 
steel but a tier behind<br>
 ATS-34 and its closest competitors (other steels 
in ATS-55's class<br>
 might be Gin-1 and AUS-8). With the molybdenum removed, 
ATS-55 does<br>
 not seem to hold an edge quite like ATS-34, and reports are 
that it's<br>
 less rust-resistant. My guess is that with the moly gone, more 
<br> chromium is tied up in carbides -- which means less free chromium for <br>

 rust resistance, and softer chromium carbides replacing moly carbides<br>
 for 
less wear resistance.<br>
<br>
 VG-10 <br>
 Another vanadium-containing 
high-end stainless steel. Due to the<br>
 vanadium content, VG-10 takes a 
killer edge, just like other vanadium<br>
 steels like BG-42 and AUS-8. VG-10 
is also tougher and more<br>
 rust-resistant than ATS-34, and seems to hold an 
edge better.<br>
<br>
 BG-42 <br>
 BG-42 is somewhat similar to ATS-34, with 
two major differences: It has<br>
 twice as much manganese as ATS-34, and has 
1.2% vanadium (ATS-34 has no<br>
 vanadium), so look for significantly better 
edge-holding than ATS-34.<br>
 The addition of vanadium and the clean 
manufacturing process (VIM/VAR)<br>
 also gives BG-42 better toughness than 
ATS-34. Chris Reeve switched<br>
 from ATS-34 to BG-42 in his Sebenzas, but has 
now moved to S30V.<br>
<br>
 S30V - S60V (CPM T440V) - S90V (CPM T420V) <br>
 
Two steels that hold an edge superbly, world class type edgeholding,<br>
 but 
it can be difficult to get the edge there in the first place.<br>
 These steels 
are made with Crucible's particle metallurgy process, and<br>
 that process 
allows these steels to be packed with more alloying<br>
 elements than 
traditional steel manufacturing methods would allow.<br>
 Both steels are very 
high in vanadium, which accounts for their<br>
 incredible wear resistanceg. 
Spyderco offers at least one model in CPM<br>
 S60V. Spyderco, one major user 
of S60V, has cut back hardness<br>
 down to 55-56Rc, in order to keep toughness 
acceptable, but that<br>
 sacrifices strength so there is a tradeoff. S90V is 
CPM's<br>
 follow-on to 440V, and with less chromium and almost double the <br>

 vanadium, is more wear-resistant and tougher than S60V -- and, in<br>
 fact, 
is probably more wear-resistant than any other stainless<br>
 steel used in the 
cutlery industry. As such, S90V<br>
 is in the running with steels like BG-42 
as among the best<br>
 general-purpose stainless steels; however, S90V is even 
more expensive<br>
 and difficult to work than BG-42, so it's strictly in the 
realm of<br>
 custom makers currently.. <br>
<br>
 CPM S30V: <br>
 The newest 
stainless steel from Crucible, purpose-designed as a<br>
 cutlery steel. This 
steel gives A-2-class toughness and almost-S90V<br>
 class wear resistance, at 
reasonable hardness (~59-60 Rc). This mix<br>
 of attributes is making S30V one 
of the hottest stainless steels<br>
 going, with makes such as Chris Reeve 
switching from BG-42 to S30V.<br>
 Will this be the new king of general-purpose 
stainless cutlery steels?<br>
 We'll know over the next couple of years. <br>

<br> 400 Series Stainless <br>
 Before Cold Steel switched to AUS-8, many of 
their stainless products<br>
 were marketed as being of &quot;400 Series 
Stainless&quot;. Other knife<br>
 companies are beginning to use the same term. 
What exactly *is* 400<br>
 Series Stainless? I always imagined it was 440-A, 
but there's nothing<br>
 to keep a company from using any 4xx steel, like 420 
or 425M, and<br>
 calling it 400 Series Stainless. </blockquote> <br>

<blockquote> C. Damascus Steel -- see www.dfoggknives.com for much more detail 
<br> <br>
 Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different 
metals<br>
 (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded; to get an idea 
<br> of the process, see Don Fogg's URL listed in the bibliography. The <br>
 
damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different<br>
 
rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.<br>
<br>
 Damascus can be 
made with performance and/or aesthetic objectives in<br>
 mind. Aesthetically, 
the choice of materials is important. One<br>
 shiney steel and one darker 
steel etch out to show the most striking<br>
 pattern. If the maker is going 
more for beauty than performance, he<br>
 might even go with nickel, which is 
bright but does not perform as<br>
 well as steel for cutlery applications. The 
other factor affecting<br>
 beauty is of course the welding pattern. Many 
patterns of damascus<br>
 are available today, from random to star to ladder, 
and a whole lot<br>
 more. <br>
<br>
 The following steels will provide bright 
lines:<br>
<br>
 L-6 and 15N20 (the Swedish version of L-6) -- nickel content 
<br> O-1 -- chromium content <br>
 ASTM 203 E -- nickel content <br>
 Nickel 
<br> <br>
 The following steels will provide dark lines: <br>

 52100 <br>
 W-2 <br>
<br>
<br>
 D. Non-steels used for 
cutlery<br>
<br>
 Talonite - Stellite 6K - Boye Dendritic Cobalt (BDC) <br>
 
These cobalt alloys have incredible wear resistance, and are<br>
 practically 
corrosion resistant. Stellite 6K has been around for<br>
 years, but was 
expensive and very difficult to work, and so is only<br>
 rarely seen. Talonite 
is easier to work, and as a result has been<br>
 gaining in popularity, 
especially among web-based knife buyers. David<br>
 Boye uses his casting 
process to manufacture Boye Dendritic Cobalt.<br>
 This material is tough and 
has great wear resistance, but is relatively<br>
 weak. These materials are 
essentially very hard carbides suspended<br>
 in a very soft matrix (40s Rc), 
which gives the great wear resistance<br>
 but lack of working strength. <br>

<br> <br>
 Titanium <br>
 Newer titanium alloys can be hardened near 50 Rc, and 
at that hardness<br>
 seem to take something approaching a useful edge. It is 
extremely<br>
 rust-resistant, and is non-magnetic. Popular as expensive dive 
knives<br>
 these days, because the SEALs use it as their knife when working 
<br> around magnetic-detonated mines. Mission knives uses titanium. <br>
 
Tygrys makes a knife with a steel edge sandwiched by titanium.<br>
<br>
 
Ceramics<br>
 Numerous knives have been offered with ceramic blades. Usually, 
those<br>
 blades are very very brittle, and cannot be sharpened by the user; 
<br> however, they hold an edge well. Boker and Kyocera make knives from <br>
 
this type of ceramic. Kevin McClungcame out with a ceramic<br>
 composite knife 
blade that much tougher than the previous ceramics,<br>
 tough enough to 
actually be useful as a knife blade for most jobs. It<br>
 is also 
user-sharpenable, and holds an edge incredibly well.<br>

 V. BIBLIOGRAPHY <br>

<br> I got theinformation for this FAQ <br>
 from my own experience as a 
collector and amateur knifemaker, and from<br>
 conversations with custom 
makers. There are too many people on<br>
 the internet who have taught me about 
steels for me to name them all,<br>
 but I've particulary sought out the posts 
of people like Jerry Hossom and<br>
 Cliff Stamp. I've also read plenty of <br>

 articles on steels, but here are the ones that I actually had in front<br>
 of 
me:<br>
<br>
 Bob Engnath's Blades and Stuff Catalog. Bob's catalog is a <br>
 
must-see for everyone, even for just collectors, as it contains<br>
 a wealth 
of information on all kinds of great knife subjects.<br>
 There is a section on 
knife steels. Bob passed away in 1998,<br>
 but if you can find an old copy of 
his catalog, grab it.<br>
 &quot;The Secrets of Steel,&quot; by Butch Winter, 
_Tactical<br>
 Knives_, Spring 1995. <br>
 &quot;What Alloys Do For Blade 
Steel,&quot; by Wayne Goddard, _Blade_,<br>

damascus steels from his website<br>
