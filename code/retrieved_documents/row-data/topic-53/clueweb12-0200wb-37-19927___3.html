<p><strong>What are ceramic knives made of?</strong><br>
These knives are made 
of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called 
zirconia). Zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically 
inert. For the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs 
(vs. steel at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).</p> 
<p><strong>How do I sharpen ceramic knives?</strong><br>
You can resharpen 
your ceramic knife by using our&nbsp;resharpening service. Only Kyocera 
advanced ceramic knives can be sharpened with this service. We also offer a 
ceramic knife sharpener for Kyocera knives. It's a great at-home solution to 
refreshen and resharpen Kyocera blades.</p> 
<p><strong>Will a ceramic knife break if I drop it?</strong><br>
Any knife, 
whether stainless steel or ceramic, will potentially break at the tip if its 
dropped on a hard surface at a certain angle. Unfortunately, accidental damage 
can occur so we do offer&nbsp;resharpening services.</p> 
<p><strong>How can I damage a ceramic knife?</strong><br>
Two ways. First, you 
can chip the edge if you cut into bones. Second, you can break off the tip or 
snap off the handle if you use it to pry or twist.</p> 
<p><strong>Can I put my ceramic knife in the dishwasher?</strong><br>
We do 
not recommend this for several reasons. First, it's dangerous if someone 
forgets about the knife or reaches in the wrong way. Second, violent motion 
against other objects, especially hard plates, could chip the objects and/or 
the knife. Third, dishwashers ruin wood handles. Finally, ceramic knives are 
very easy to clean with a hand washing or mild bleach solution (blade only).</p>
<p><strong>Do Kyocera knives come with a warranty?</strong><br>
All Kyocera 
knives comes with a&nbsp;lifetimewarranty. (pdf/105KB)&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Where should I store my Kyocera ceramic knife?</strong><br>
You can 
store your Kyocera ceramic knife in a conventional knife block, in an in-drawer 
tray, or in the package.</p> 
<p><strong>Where can I buy Kyocera ceramic knives?</strong><br>
To check for 
the nearest retailer, go to&nbsp;Where to Buy.</p> 
<p><strong>Who do I contact if I want to sell Kyocera knives in my store?
</strong><br>
Email us at&nbsp;cpd@kyocera.com. We service retailers both 
directly and through our network of manufacturer's representatives.</p> 
<p><strong>Where are Kyocera knives made?</strong><br>
Kyocera advanced 
ceramic knives are made in Japan.</p> 
<p><strong>How should I use my Kyocera ceramic knife?</strong><br>
For slicing 
fruits, vegetables and boneless meats, a Kyocera advanced ceramic knife has no 
equal. Even so, ceramic knives are intended to complement -- not replace -- 
your other cutlery. Use steel knives for carving, prying, boning, cutting 
frozen foods, and slicing cheese. Avoid flexing or prying. Always use them on a 
plastic or wood cutting board and avoid cutting on marble, stone or 
inappropriate surfaces like plates or kitchen tile. For more information, 
please see our&nbsp;care and use instructions.&nbsp;(pdf/52KB)</p> 
<p><strong>What is the difference between a black-HIP blade and a white blade?
</strong><br>
A black (HIP) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and 
offers extra durability. This type of blade goes through an extra firing 
process called a &quot;hot-isostatic press,&quot; creating a tighter weave 
between the ceramic molecules, thus creating a tougher blade. The white ceramic 
blade is also made out of zirconium oxide but does not go through this 
expensive sintering process.</p> 
<p><strong>Can I use a ceramic sharpening rod on a ceramic knife?</strong><br>

No. The ceramic sharpeners are used to sharpen all steel-based knives, 
including titanium because the same hardness principle applies. Ceramic is 
harder than all metals, so it is the ideal surface to re-sharpen these softer 
materials.</p> 
<p><strong>How do I say &quot;Kyocera&quot; correctly?</strong><br>
The 
correct pronunciation is &quot;key-O-Sarah,&quot; which comes from &quot;Kyoto 
Ceramics,&quot; the original name of the company.</p> 
<p><strong>What else does Kyocera make?</strong><br>
Kyocera is one of the 
world's leaders in advanced ceramics and electronics. We manufacture a wide 
variety of products including semiconductor packages, capacitors, thermal print 
heads, resistors, cutting tool inserts, circuit substrates, LCD panels, fiber 
optic components, car engine components, solar modules, laser printers, 
wielding nozzles, cellular/PHS phones, pump components, synthetic gemstones, 
thread and wire guides, antenna mounts, and lots of other neat stuff!</p> 
<p><strong>What are ceramic scissors made of?</strong><br>
These scissors are 
made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called 
zirconia). This material, which is second in hardness only to diamond, was 
originally developed for industrial applications where metal components failed. 
Zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert. For 
the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs (vs. steel 
at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).</p> 
<p><strong>Will ceramic scissors break if I drop them?</strong><br>
Ceramic 
scissors will not shatter when dropped. Like forged steel scissors, however, 
you can break the tip if the scissors land on the tip (very uncommon). You can 
also damage ceramic scissors by trying to cut very thick material or by trying 
to bend the blades. Ceramic blades are strong, but not flexible.</p> 
<p><strong>Do you replace peeler blades?</strong><br>
Yes, many of blades on 
our peelers can be replaced. For more information about this service,&nbsp;
