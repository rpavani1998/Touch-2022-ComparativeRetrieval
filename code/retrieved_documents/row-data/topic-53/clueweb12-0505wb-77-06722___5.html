Hmmm. Thanks GW.  I've never 
had those issues much. But, I will keep my eyes out for one, just out of 
curiosity.<br>

Location: USA,Massachusetts  Posts: 25,136  I have never tried them either 
Rocklobster, but the benefits are supposed to be that they can be very very 
sharp and will stay sharper a lot longer than your typical kitchen knife.<br>

<br> The downsides are that they are fragile and can shatter if misused or 
dropped. They also can not easily be sharpened at home. They need to be sent 
out to be sharpened.<br>
<br>
 From what I have read from the knife experts 
here at DC, some Japanese steel can actually be made sharper than ceramic if 
you know what you are doing. My favorite J knife I was able to get so sharp 
that I could not imagine ever needing it any sharper. I do not have to worry as 
much if I drop it on a hard surface or hit bone. <br>

 Disadvantages: 
Can't sharpen at home when they do get dull; more brittle than are metal knives 
(But they are stronger than many people think); not as sharp as some of my 
steel knives, but sharp enough for most slicing jobs.<br>
<br>
 Seeeeeeya;

 Exactly. And they are a lot lighter, 
obviously. Though that's not an issue for me.<br>
<br>
 I just used my Xmas 
ceramic knife last night and it's razor sharp!!  __________________ <br>

Posts: 1,181  Ceramic knives aren't my cup of tea. OOTB most of them aren't 
real sharp. Now I know what many of you are thinking...<i>hey, Rob- I have one 
and it was super sharp, the sharpest I've ever seen, smart guy!</i> Be that as 
it may, it ain't the sharpest I've ever seen! Tool steel, carbon steel and the 
best stainless steel knives will get much sharper than the ceramics you buy.<br>
<br> Ceramics are also relatively fragile. Some people have had good luck but 
it's a crap shoot. Ceramic is extremely strong but not very ductile (meaning 
malleable). It won't roll or bend to speak of- when subjected to enough shock 
or force it will simply snap. I've seen tips break off and ceramics snap clean 
in two.<br>
<br>
 You also won't have much luck sharpening them yourself. It 
can be done if you have the right equipment, but ceramic isn't all that far 
from diamond in hardness; Diamond is a 10 on the Mohs scale while the hardest 
ceramics are actually between 8 and 9. That means most of the things that can 
sharpen steel will hardly scratch ceramic. However, just as the Grand Canyon 
was worn by running water, the knife won't stay sharp forever. Constant use and 
impact with the cutting board will dull it over time. Especially glass cutting 
boards (glass can be nearly as hard as ceramic).  __________________ <br>

them carefully of they can get chipped makes sense. I suppose a butcher block 
would be ok. It's just that you have to &quot;special treat them&quot; that has 
kept me from buying them.<br>

 Thanks all for your responses .. I never heard 
of them before, and I saw this commercial for one, and thought to ask you DC 
peeps about them <br>

interest to make less than great ceramic knives that easily dull, so that 
customers would have to loyally and repeatedly return them for sharpening... 
for a fee, perhaps?<br>
<br>
 I've yet to own, or even try one, but I'm certain 
I someday will.  __________________ <br>

I don't think so, since no one would buy them in the first place. Their main 
selling point is sharpness.<br>
<br>
 They charge $10 to sharpen 2 knives.

Date: Jan 2011  Location: Duluth, MN  Posts: 360  I used my mom's ($20) yoshi 
ceramic knife, and was so impressed by the ease with which it sliced through 
veggies that I went out and bought one. My bf used it to cut up a chicken (with 
bones, which you are not supposed to do) and promptly broke off the tip. A few 
months later, I was going to be cutting up a bunch of lettuce for a nacho bar, 
and borrowed my mom's knife, since I happened to be at her house. I used it on 
a few other things since I happened to have it (the bf was under strict orders 
to keep his hands off it though ;) ), and it was very noticeably less sharp. I 
wouldn't buy one again for this reason. If I cut up lettuce all the time I 
would consider it, but I don't. I would rather have a decent steel knife, and a 
good sharpener any day. (The restaurant I work at, however, should invest in 
one of them...)<br>

Allentown PA  Posts: 68  I recently took a class on Essential Knife Skills, and 
learned a lot regarding knives. We went over different kinds of knives - from 
forged to stamped, and even ceramic knives.<br>
<br>
 Goodweed of the North was 
right on regarding her advantages and disadvantages for ceramic knives! They 
are very durable and stay sharp for a very long time. Unfortunately, they are 
not sharpenable, and will most definitely break if they are dropped or even 
placed harshly onto a hard countertop.<br>
<br>
 I think I'd definitely stick 
to the steel in most cases!<br>
<br>
 Also, I found the ceramic knives SO sharp 
that they were actually difficult to use. If you are used to a steel knife, 
definitely stick with it! The safest knife you can have is one you are 
comfortable using.<br>
<br>
 Hope that this helps in answering some of your 
knife questions! I'm currently writing a Essential Knife Skills series for my 
blog, so all of this information is right at the top of my head lol! :D <br>
