<br>
Knife makers put 
grantons or kullens on numerous styles of knives. It should not be a problem to 
find, a chef knife with kullens.<br>
<br>
 Many magazine and individual reviews 
have not found that kullens don't add much, if anything to the performance of a 
knife. The exception is a company called Glestain.<br>

price wise of entry level. The thing I can't figure out is how the heck you can 
sharpen all the way to the heel. The plastic &quot;bolster&quot;, or rather the 
front end of the handle, is very, very thick and molded at about a 45 degree 
angle. My brother has a knife branded by Edward Don that looks exactly like the 
Sanelli right down to the two-tone coloration except that it's gray with red 
accents. It's impossible to sharpen the very heel, either on stones or belts.

 I know some people like them but I'd give them a wide berth. JMOHO-

This 
criticism can be made for most western knives, because of the bolster. Is your 
recommendation then to pick up a stamped steel knife such as a Forschner?<br>

 Join Date: Jan 2008  Location: Richmond, Va  Posts: 937  After looking at the 
specs, design, and price of this knife, it seems to me to have very little to 
offer. The knife is made of 440 steel hardened to 52-54 R. 440 is not the best 
grade of steel, and 52 is pretty soft. I don't see a 52 R steel holding an edge 
for any length of time. VG 10 is typically hardened to 60 or better. The 45 
degree bolster would get in the way when using the knife to its outer limits of 
length, i.e halving a melon, and a with the bolster shape and materiel, would 
be difficult to sharpen without damaging the bolster. The cutting edge runs to 
the bolster. You either like the design or you don't. I don't. The site 
advertises the green color as being easier to see on the cutting surface. Not 
sure that would make a difference. A stainless blade with a black handle is 
pretty visible, and it is not a good idea to leave knives laying around anyway.
<br> <br>
 All in all, for my purposes and for the price, I think you would be 
better off with a commercial grade Forschner or Dexter, or a German Henkels or 
Wusthoff, or for a little more, a Japanese VG 10 blade.  __________________ <br>

 Coltellerie Sanelli S.p.A. created 
its Premana Professional collection by analysing and solving every last one of 
the problems that are encountered by the professional who uses these working 
tools every day. In short, these are the salient properties of the Premana 
Professional collection:<br>
<br>
 BLADES <br>
<br>
 Resistant hardness (54-56 
HRC).<br>
 Good flexibility. <br>
 High cutting power. <br>
 Long edge life. 
<br> Edge shape especially designed for professional use. <br>
 Excellent 
sharpening potential.<br>
 The convex shape of the edge guarantees an efficient 
support when the user has to exert considerable force. The edge is not subject 
to chipping.<br>
 HANDLES <br>
<br>
 The exclusive ergonomic handle design is 
the result of special studies carried out at qualified University Institutes (a 
research unit named EPM: Ergonomics of Posture and Movement at the Milan 
Polytechnic) and tested by computerized experimental tests.<br>
 The ergonomic 
shape brings a sharp reduction in user fatigue.<br>
 The soft, but slightly 
rough surface makes the handle non-slip and much safer to use.<br>
 The 
material used is non-toxic and complies with the European rules.<br>
 The 
material used will resist sudden temperature changes (from -40&deg;C to 
+150&deg;C), corrosive agents and detergents.<br>
 This means that the knife 
can be cleaned in a dishwasher and sterilized.<br>
 The handle is perfectly 
balanced with the blade.<br>
 The handle&#146;s green colour makes the knife 
immediately visible on the work bench: greater safety at work. The shape of the 
handle was designed at the computer.<br>
 By creating the Premana Professional 
collection, the aim of Coltellerie Sanelli S.p.A. is to make a decisive 
contribution to improving safety, reliability and hygiene at work. No other 
collection of professional cutlery currently available has all these 
properties. The Premana Professional collection knives are covered by European 
and U.S. patents.  __________________ <br>

That criticism does apply to most Euro style knives, that's 
true- and they should be avoided if you know what you're doing. Well, my normal 
recommendation it to get a Japanese knife, that's wafer thin with no bolster! 
But until you've seen that knife I don't thing you really &quot;get&quot; just 
how fat the handle is. All &quot;traditional&quot; Euro-style knives with a 
bolster are fatally flawed<i>re</i> sharpening the 1/4&quot; in front of the 
bolster. But the Sanellis (unless the newer ones are different) it's almost 
impossible to the last 1/2&quot; of the heel. We're talking almost 1&quot; 
thick vs the 1/4&quot; that you can't effectively sharpen on a traditional 
German boat anchor. Obviously you're better off letting the Germans build your 
car and the Japanese build your knives. But if you have to cut corners you can 
at least get the best of an inferior breed. If you're not willing to get 
serious than a Forschner Fibrox might be your best bet. <br>
<br>
 If you're a 
little bit more serious than most, but don't want to spend enough to get a 
Japanese knife, get a Sab. But be advised that many companies use the name...

 Join Date: Jun 2010  Posts: 141  I received a Shun classic hg with 
vg10 clad steel last christmas. I love the knife. I looked online to see what 
the recommended for sharpening and they said you should only sharpen it twice a 
year! The steel is folded so well it wont dull if you use a good cutting board. 
I really didn't believe it. They also said to make sure you bring it to a 
professional sharpener who can put a perfect 16 degree edge on it. I believe 
there are also sharpeners you can buy to make the same angle. I've used it for 
4 months now, and it is still amazingly sharp.<br>

Posts: 937  I sent off my daily user Kanetsune gyoto a few weeks back after a 
year of daily use. Still pretty sharp. Kanetsune and Shun steels are very 
similar. If you use a wood cutting board, wash by hand, and don't drop it on 
the granite counter top, the edge will last a long time.<br>

<br>
The part about the 
folding steel or doing it so well, makes a knife with good retention, in 
general isn't true.<br>
<br>
 The steel in Japanese knives is harder then those 
typically found in European knives. Harder means brittle. A hard knife, made 
out of steel or ceramic will chip. To compensate makers will sandwich or clad 
the hard steel, between soft steel. The edge can still chip, but the knife 
won't break, like a ceramic.<br>
<br>
 Depending on the properties knife makers 
value, will effect their choice of steel and how they work with it. Shun values 
a sharp knife that will hold its edge a long time.<br>
<br>
 Knives that have 
good wear resistance, in general are more difficult to sharpen. Additionally 
the cladding on a Shun is very soft and will easily scratch.<br>
<br>
<br>
 The 
Edge Pro is a nice system, if you have a number of knives to sharpen. If you 
only have the Shun, then sending it out, makes more sense. Just make sure 
whoever you send the knife to, is familiar with Japanese steel and Shuns.<br>
