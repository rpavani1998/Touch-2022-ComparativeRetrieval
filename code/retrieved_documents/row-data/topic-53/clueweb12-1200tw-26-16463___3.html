 There are a lot of kitchen gadgets out there. 
Honestly, although neat, you don't need the mass majority of them.&nbsp; 
Contained in this list are the basic items I think every vegan should have to 
create great meals.<br>
<br>
<b>Cast Iron Skillet</b> <br>
<br>
Tired of your 
tofu sticking? Worried you aren't getting enough Iron in your diet? Don't have 
time to go to the gym and lift weights? A good cast iron skillet is the 
solution! Why people ever stopped using them for everyday use I'll never 
understand. They work best for browning, frying, camp cooking, and pretty much 
anything else you'd use a skillet for. They do require a bit of extra care to 
maintain the &quot;seasoning&quot; that keeps them non-stick, but trust me, 
it's worth it. Both Lodge and Le Creuset make great pre-seasoned options. 
Invest a few dollars in a good quality one, plus take the 30 extra seconds 
after washing, to oil the surface and you'll have it for a lifetime. You can 
also find them at second hand stores, if you don't mind the extra work of 
re-seasoning them. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Good Quality Kitchen Knives</b> <br>
<br>

Even if you only purchase a Chef's Knife and Paring Knife, please buy good 
quality blades. You'll save yourself time, effort, money in the long run, and 
yourself from possible trips to the emergency room. There are several great 
companies out there but,Wusthof, J.A. Henckels, and Kyocera, are my favorites. 
If you go with traditional stainless steel blades, be sure to purchase a 
sharpener by the same company. Their sharpeners are set to hone the edge to the 
specific angle of their knives. Using a sharpener from a different company will 
offset your blade. If you aren't interested in having to maintain your blades, 
Kyocera Ceramic Knives are a great option, as the non-porous material doesn't 
dull like steel. The big drawback of ceramic is that they're a bit delicate. 
Don't drop them in the sink or use them to open can lids, you'll break them. 
<br> <br>
<br>
<b>Food Processor</b> <br>
<br>
How on earth I went so many 
years without a food processor in my kitchen, I'll never know. Its easily the 
hardest working small appliance in my house. I use it for sauces, dips, dough, 
chopping, mincing, slicing, and blending. Again this is something you want to 
invest some money in. You really can't go wrong with aCuisinart, considering 
they introduced the world to the food processor. They have several size and 
function options to choose from. My personal favorite is their Prep 11 Plus, 
its basic, but it has everything you need.Kitchenaid also has several good 
options. I recently got to demo their new 13 Cup with ExactSlice, and if you 
plan to do a lot of slicing, this is the one to go with. It works amazing and 
you can control the slice thickness with an exterior switch instead of the 
hassle of taking it apart. <br>
<br>
<b>Stock Pot</b> <br>
<br>
A good stock 
pot is a wonderful thing. For everyday use an 8 quart is the perfect size. It's 
just right for soups, pasta sauce, rice, mashed potatoes, etc... Look for a pot 
that has a heavy bottom, as this will cut down on any sticking. I like
Calphalon'sSimply Calphalon 8 qt. Multi-purpose Stockpot, as it comes with a 
steamer basket and pasta insert for a reasonable price. If you'd like to get 
into canning, look for a 20 quart pot, like thisone from Nordic Ware. <br>
<br>

<br> <b>Bamboo Steamer</b> <br>
<br>
Want perfectly steamed veggies, dumplings, 
or a great way to keep tortillas warm for burritos? Grab a 10 inchBamboo Steamer
from Joyce Chen. They're inexpensive and seriously come in handy. I use mine 
for steaming homemade seitan, savory and sweet dumplings, and for quick and 
easy steamed veggies on nights when I'm not in a cooking mood. <br>
<br>
I also 
suggest some heavy duty baking sheets and pans, a silicone collapsible 
strainer, a counter top compost bin, and a good quality blender. You'll find 
you have little use for much else and don't have to replace things as often, if 
at all, when you invest in a few quality items. <br>
