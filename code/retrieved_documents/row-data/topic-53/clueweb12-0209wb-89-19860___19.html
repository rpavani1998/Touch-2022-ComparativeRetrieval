<h2>Blade Steels</h2> <br>
<br>

<h1>This simple but informative guide to the basics of steel is limited to the 
discussion of useful bits which a knife collector could find informative and 
which would expand in a beneficial way the knowledge of someone in the early 
stages of knife collecting. I am not a Metallurgist, nor do I pretend to be a 
steel &#147;Expert&#148;. When it comes to knife collecting, such is not 
necessary. However a working knowledge of the basics will assist in making your 
collecting decisions and will go a long way toward filling your knife stable 
with thoroughbreds.</h1> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is steel?<br>
 At its most 
basic, steel is essentially Iron combined with Carbon. Other alloys can also be 
added and the presence of these alloys will add characteristics to the material 
which are useful according to the purpose for which it is being created. One 
alloy may add a degree of corrosion resistance, while another increases 
toughness. This recipe has been changed and modified endlessly throughout the 
centuries as the quest for the &quot;Ultimate Steel&quot; continues. While no 
such thing may actually exist, this process of discovery has left us with a 
variety of steels that are well suited to different tasks and are chosen 
according to the anticipated use.<br>
<br>
What is Stainless Steel?<br>
 
Stainless steel is steel which contains the element Chromium in sufficient 
quantity that the steel takes on a rust resistant property. This quantity has 
not been firmly agreed upon, however is generally accepted for cutlery purposes 
to be within the 13% range. Stainless steel is known to &quot;Stain Less&quot;, 
but can still show some evidence of corrosion if exposed to particularly acidic 
or corrosive environments. In other words it is corrosion resistant as opposed 
to corrosion proof.<br>
<br>
What is Alloyed Steel?<br>
 Here we begin to get 
into the nuts and bolts of cutlery steel development. Alloyed steel is a 
general term indicating a substance in which additional elements have been 
added beyond those necessary to elevate the material from iron to steel. In 
other words, Carbon may be present (which creates steel from iron) with 
Chromium added (to increase corrosion resistance) and Vanadium added (to 
increase hardness). Further additions will change the material correspondingly 
and in this way the characteristic of the steel is engineered to match its 
intended use.<br>
<br>
 As one element is added to positively enhance a certain 
property, another is often negatively affected. For example, adding more Carbon 
will increase the hardness and thus edge retention of a knife, however as this 
property goes up, the property of toughness goes down. Toughness is the ability 
of the blade to withstand shock and impact without cracking, chipping or 
snapping. So while the knife may have been made to take and keep a very sharp 
edge (desirable), those properties have also created a very brittle blade 
(undesirable). To counter this another element may be added, but while helping, 
it too also presents other issues and thus the dance continues.<br>
<br>
 
Again, achieving just the right balance of trade offs between these different 
characteristics is the aim of the steelmaker and the &quot;right&quot; balance 
depends on the intended use of the steel.<br>
<br>
What is a &quot;Rockwell 
Hardness?&quot;<br>
 This measurement, often seen in the technical spec. write 
up of knives, is a measure of the hardness of the steel used on the knife. The 
number displayed is a result of a test in which a machine known as an indenter 
applies a load to the steel and the depth of the indentation made is measured. 
How deep or shallow the indenter has been able to penetrate into the steel 
under a predetermined load will reflect how hard that steel is.<br>
<br>
 Most 
knives will have a Rockwell Hardness (or HRC) displayed as a range in the upper 
50 or lower 60 range. It is typical to see a knife spec. stating HRC = 55 - 57. 
Ranges in the mid 50&#146;s would represent a softer steel than ones in the 
upper 50's and some knife steels are hardened into the 60&#146;s. The harder 
the steel is the longer the knife will hold its edge. However steels at this 
level of hardness will also be more difficult to sharpen and will be more 
brittle and susceptible to chipping.<br>
<br>
Laminated Steel<br>
 Laminated 
steels attempt to solve the tradeoff between toughness and hardness not through 
recipe ingredients but by combining steels that have different strengths into a 
single functional unit. The typical laminated steel has a core of very hard 
(and brittle) steel which provides excellent edge holding ability. It is then 
wrapped with a softer steel which provides toughness and flexibility. The spine 
and both sides of the blade are the soft steel with the harder steel peeking 
out along the edge. A laminate line may be seen along the edge where the two 
steels meet.<br>
<br>
How Does Heat Treatment work?<br>
 No discussion of blade 
steel could be had without addressing the heat treatment process. Every bit as 
important as the elements of the steel recipe is the heat treatment the steel 
receives. While much could be said on this science, my goal is to provide a 
basic understanding and thus will be a brief overview.<br>
<br>
 The purpose 
for heat treating steel is to modify the mechanical properties of the steel. 
When steel is heated to a high temperature (about 1350 degrees) it begins to 
change its molecular structure from a ferrite state to an austenite state (and 
thus losing its magnetic properties). This state is desirable and is the first 
step in altering the steel&#146;s properties to perform as needed. Depending on 
the amount of Carbon in the steel, the temperature may have to be higher or 
lower to achieve this state. Once the steel is in an austenite state, the 
performance properties may be determined by the rate of cooling and the medium 
used to accomplish the cooling.<br>
<br>
 Cooling, or quenching may be 
accomplished quickly or slowly and each way will affect the properties of the 
steel. The quench medium may also vary from simply air cooling to water 
quenching, oil quenching or other means. In a very general sense, the faster 
the steel is cooled, the harder it will be and the slower it is cooled the 
softer it will be. A rapid cool down process results in a martensite structure 
in which the molecular structure of the steel is very tight and fine, but with 
high internal stress. A slow cool will produce a molecular structure that is 
coarser and without the high internal stress.<br>
<br>
 The manufacture of 
knife steel involves the process of normalizing, annealing, quenching and 
tempering. Prior to working the steel it is desirable for the steel to be in a 
stress free state and this can be done by normalizing which is the repeated 
slow, even, heating of the steel to non-magnetic and then allowing to air cool. 
This should be done several times (taking care not to over-heat the steel) and 
will result in the even dispersion of the iron and carbon, with a uniform 
microstructure inside the steel.<br>
<br>
 Once this is accomplished the blade 
may be annealed to soften the steel and prepare it for shaping and working. 
Annealing is the heating and very slow cooling of the steel which results in a 
soft, ductile steel that may be easily filed, stamped, etc... To do this the 
steel is heated to non-magnetic and then buried in a media such as hardwood ash 
or vermiculite which acts as an insulator and will permit the steel to cool 
only very slowly, much slower than air cooling. After cooling in the ash (24 
hrs), the blade may be worked to its final shape.<br>
<br>
 The next step is 
quenching in which the blade is re-heated to non-magnetic and then rapidly 
cooled, typically in oil heated to around 150 degrees. The purpose of this is 
to re-harden the blade to a useful knife hardness. The trick is to cool the 
blade rapidly enough that martensite is achieved and not something short of 
that, such as pearlite. The quenching process is the only one in which a 
drastic change of temperature is desirable. In the other steps it is important 
to maintain the temperature evenly, within specific ranges and without large 
shifts.<br>
<br>
 Assuming the quenching has been properly done, the blade is 
now martensetic, but with high internal stress that can leave the blade prone 
to breakage. To resolve that problem and create a tough yet still hard blade, 
the steel is subjected to tempering. Tempering is the re-heating of the steel, 
but to a much lower temperature, perhaps around 400 degrees for one hour. This 
will permit the martensite to form without cracks and become a stable internal 
structure.<br>
<br>
 There are many variations to this process and different 
opinions as to what procedure, material and temperature range is best. 
Additionally, depending on the type of steel being worked, with the different 
combination of alloys, one process may be preferable to another. Finally, the 
purpose for which the steel will be used is another variable, further 
increasing the possible permutations.<br>
<br>
What is &quot;Powdered 
Steel&quot;?<br>
 This is an expensive but high quality process of combining 
precise amounts of pre-selected alloys that have been physically powdered, for 
the purpose of engineering a steel with the exact quantities of each alloy in 
an exactly even dispersion, which results in a very stable and uniform 
structure. Once the alloys have been combined they are subjected to heat 
(Sintering) where the steels self weld together and form a highly pure and 
uniform product.<br>
<br>
What are the elements of steel?<br>
 If you have ever 
looked into what steels are made of you may have seen a bewildering set of 
elements named as the primary components. Without some knowledge of what good 
each of these does, it can feel like trying to read Greek. Each element can be 
added in precise quantities to optimize its beneficial properties. These below 
are some, but certainly not all, of the more common elements used in steel and 
the reasons why.<br>
<br>
Carbon:<br>
 This is the primary element which is 
added to iron to create steel. Carbon produces a hardening affect in the alloy 
and the higher the content of carbon in the steel, the greater the hardness 
will be. Getting too hard though is not a good thing as this can result in a 
brittle blade which chips easily on impact. Carbon in the right amount allows a 
blade to be sharpened to a very keen edge and hold it well.<br>
<br>
Chromium
<br> This is the element which when added creates a stainless steel and is 
generally required in an amount of at least 13% to be considered true stainless 
steel. Chromium added to steel increases the blades hardness and ability to 
withstand staining and corrosion. Adding too much chromium can contribute to a 
brittle blade, so a balance must be struck. A &quot;stainless&quot; steel blade 
can still stain and even rust, although not at the rate a pure carbon steel 
blade would as the chromium aids in corrosion resistance.<br>
<br>
Manganese<br>
 This element also contributes to hardness as well as strength and wear 
resistance. Manganese improves a steel during the manufacture process and most 
knives have some fraction of manganese in them.<br>
<br>
Vanadium<br>
 Like 
Chromium, Vanadium will also increase hardness but also will improve a blades 
ability to take a very sharp edge. Vanadium improves stability in the steel at 
high temperatures and is found in hard tool steels. Vanadium can result in 
Rockwell hardness levels above 60.<br>
<br>
Nickel<br>
 This increases the 
toughness of a steel and may play a role in corrosion resistance.<br>
<br>

Silicon<br>
 Adds to the strength of a steel and assists in the manufacturing 
process.<br>
<br>
Boron<br>
 Added in small amounts to increase hardenability. 
Boron steel is often added to steel for hard use implements such as spades or 
other tools.<br>
<br>
Definitions:<br>
<br>
Edge Retention<br>
 Simple to 
define, edge retention is the degree to which a knife will maintain a sharp 
edge when used. Not so simple is achieving such. The edge retention of a pocket 
knife will be achieved through a different steel than that of a machete and the 
medium in which the cutting will be done plays an important role. If cutting 
through tough, fibrous material is to be done, then wear resistance will be 
critical to edge retention. If the cutting is to involve dense materials such 
as wood, then strength will be important to edge retention. It&#146;s about 
more than just making a sharp edge.<br>
<br>
Toughness<br>
 The ability to 
withstand impact and sudden shock forces that may be involved in activities 
such as hacking, chopping, throwing or shearing forces encountered through 
prying and twisting are what is in view here. A very hard, brittle blade would 
chip or snap under these conditions and would not be considered 
&quot;tough&quot;. Although perhaps counter-intuitive, the toughest blades are 
those made from a softer steel which can absorb these forces without damage.<br>
<br> Wear Resistance<br>
 Closely related to toughness, wear resistance is a 
measure of the amount of abrasion a blade steel can withstand without degrading 
effect. A rolled edge or scratching of the steel is in view here. Adding Carbon 
will increase a steel&#146;s wear resistance.<br>
<br>
Corrosion Resistance<br>

 The ability to resist rust and pitting. Higher degrees of Chromium added to 
the mix will enhance this ability. Even full stainless steel (at least 13% 
chromium) can still stain and corrode, although at a much slower rate than a 
pure carbon steel. H1 is a non-carbon steel developed to be essentially rust 
proof.<br>
<br>
Tensile Strength<br>
 This is a measure of the ability of a 
steel to resist a force attempting to bend or break it.<br>
<br>
Steels<br>
<br>
420/420J2<br>
 A soft steel and therefore quite tough but not very wear 
resistant. This steel will suffer when used on abrasive materials and is not 
known for holding an edge well. Inexpensive to manufacture and thus popular on 
low end knives, this steel is useful and has it place, but not as a top end 
product. Sometimes used as the softer outer steel on a laminated blade (SOG 
mini-Vulcan).<br>
<br>
440A/440B/440C<br>
 Better than their 420 cousin, the 
440&#146;s are a series of steels with increasing Carbon content from A to C. 
440A is recognized as a good but minimum quality general use steel (better than 
420). The 440B is better and thought quite well of, and 440C is excellent. Each 
is known for good toughness and edge retention and has been used to good effect 
in knives of all sorts for many years.<br>
<br>
AUS6/AUS8/AUS 10<br>
 Similar 
to the 440 series but slightly better in the sense these steels do have a 
Vanadium content which the 440&#146;s lack and therefore can acquire a keener 
edge. The AUS series falls into the same categories as 440 with the 
good/better/best progression. AUS8 is good, mid-grade steel and AUS10 competes 
with steels like ATS-34.<br>
<br>
1055/1095 Carbon<br>
 The &quot;10&quot; 
series steels have an increasing amount of carbon in them as the number 
increases and a corresponding degree of wear resistance as well. 1095 is the 
default knife steel out of this series (Tops Tom Brown Trapper). Items such as 
swords or hatchets are often made out of the lower carbon 1055. The Cold Steel 
Vietnam Tomahawk is made from 1055.<br>
<br>
ATS-34 &amp; 154CM<br>
 These two 
steels are quite similar to each other. Both considered premium, high quality 
steel for a knife. These steels will hold an edge very well yet still retain a 
good degree of toughness. Not as corrosion resistant as the 400 series, but 
still considered an upgrade in comparison.<br>
<br>
VG-10<br>
 A stainless 
steel with a high Vanadium content which can be sharpened to an extremely keen 
edge. Good toughness, wear resistance and edge holding as well.<br>
<br>
S30V
<br> Specifically designed to be a cutlery steel, this steel has excellent 
toughness as well as wear resistance, hardness and edge holding. An all around 
excellent performer and is found on the best production knives.<br>
<br>
O1<br>

 A good steel that is easy to work with. O1 takes an edge well and holds it. It 
is also quite tough but can succumb to corrosion more easily than others.<br>

<br> D2<br>
 Although not a true stainless, D2 has enough Chromium to thwart 
corrosion to a good extent. This steel excels in toughness and wear resistance 
and with a good ability to resist corrosion it makes for a fine choice.<br>
<br>
H1<br>
 A precipitation hardened steel, H1 is made with nitrogen instead of 
carbon and thus is impervious to rust. It is the choice for diving knives which 
will come in contact with salt water or other highly corrosive environments.<br>
