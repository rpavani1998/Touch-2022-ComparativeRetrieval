<h1>A few hone truths</h1> 3 May 2009 | Category Basic concepts, Knife skills, 
Knives <strong>|</strong> 6 comments &raquo; <br>

<p>Keeping your kitchen knives sharp is one of those jobs where a little bit 
of effort every now and again saves a lot of trouble in the long run.</p> 
<h3>Why is it so important to have sharp knives?</h3> 
<p>There are three main reasons.</p> 
<p>The first is safety. Sharp knives cut easily through whatever it is 
you&rsquo;re trying to cut. Blunt knives require more force, and more force 
means less control &ndash; particularly if you slip. And slipping is far more 
likely with a blunt knife. (Have you ever had difficulty getting started when 
slicing a tomato? Then your knife wasn&rsquo;t sharp enough.)</p> 
<p>The second is simple efficiency. It takes a lot more effort to cut food 
using a blunt knife than it does with a sharp one. Use a sharp knife, and 
you&rsquo;ll get finished faster and get a lot less tired in the process. 
You&rsquo;ll probably find the process a lot more satisfying, too.</p> 
<p>The third concerns the food itself. A blunt blade needs more force to push 
it through the food. That force gets spread more widely throughout the food, 
bruising it around the cut. As a result, you lose flavour, and the appearance 
isn&rsquo;t helped either. This also explains why it&rsquo;s best to have a 
really sharp knife when chopping onions &ndash; the sharper the knife, the less 
you cry.</p> 
<h3>How do I keep my knives sharp?</h3> 
<p>The best way is by regular use of a steel to hone your knives. (Not 
&lsquo;sharpen&rsquo; them, you&rsquo;ll note. Sharpening is what you do to 
create the edge, not to maintain it &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a more heavy-duty 
process that involves grinding the blade down using a stone or a mechanical 
grinding tool.)</p> 
<p>Most of us have a mental picture in our heads of how a steel should be 
used, involving the rapid brandishing of steel and knife in mid-air. While you 
can do it that way &ndash; and many professionals do &ndash; it&rsquo;s 
difficult, and involves a certain amount of risk that you&rsquo;ll cut yourself 
if your attention wanders.</p> 
<p>A safer way (and easier, if you&rsquo;re unused to honing knives) is to 
place a towel on your worktop or kitchen table and (using your non-knife 
wielding hand) hold the steel in front of you with the tip firmly on the towel, 
pointing straight downwards. Place the heel end of the edge of the blade 
against the top of the steel&rsquo;s grooved surface, so that the edge meets 
the steel at an angle of about 20 degrees. (20&deg; is the angle to which most 
manufacturers grind their blades). Then, using moderate pressure and 
maintaining the 20&deg; angle, draw the knife towards you and down so that the 
whole length of the blade &ndash; right to the tip! &ndash; is pulled against 
the steel at the correct angle. About five times on each side of the edge 
should be enough, if you do it regularly.</p> 
<h3>How often should I hone my knives?</h3> 
<p>This depends on how often you use them and &ndash; to a certain extent 
&ndash; what you use them on, especially in terms of what work surface you use. 
Wooden boards (particularly end-grain wooden boards, like butcher&rsquo;s 
blocks) are kinder on your edges than plastic; glass and marble &ldquo;chopping 
boards&rdquo; are a disaster. Once a week will probably be enough in most 
cases, though you may want to do it more frequently than that for the knives 
you use most often, and<em>vice versa</em>. And the more often you do it, the 
less effort you&rsquo;ll need to put into doing it each time.</p> 
<h3>What sort of steel should I use? Are diamond and ceramic steels better 
than steel ones?</h3> 
<p>Use a steel made of steel, with a medium or fine grooved surface; the 
longer the better. (Too short, and you&rsquo;ll find it hard to get the right 
honing action. A good guide to go by is the length of your longest blade plus 
five centimetres/two inches.) The diamond and ceramic steels last longer, but 
they&rsquo;re for sharpening rather than honing. A steel steel generally lasts 
for three to four years in normal use.<br>
 All this may seem like a bit of a 
chore, but it&rsquo;s worth persevering with. With a bit of practice, 
you&rsquo;ll soon have it down to a fine art &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll find your 
cooking becomes more enjoyable as a result.</p> 
<p>As usual, I recommend Nisbets for kitchen equipment. They&rsquo;ve got a 
vast range of honing and sharpening tools for kitchen knives, ranging from less 
than a tenner to well over a hundred pounds &ndash; just click on the banner

<p>As someone who is guilty of not sharpening (or should I say 
&lsquo;honing&rsquo;) our knives regularly enough, you&rsquo;ve just motivated 
me to do something about it. There&rsquo;s another job for this evening.</p>

<p>When I worked in a professional kitchen, I used the steel every day before 
using any knife for work. These days, even though I cook a lot, it&rsquo;s not 
necessary to do it all the time.</p> 
<p>I think some people like to show off, because they can do this 
impressive-looking rapid brandishing stuff. But it&rsquo;s not recommended and 
it&rsquo;s quite an easy way to give yourself a nasty cut if you&rsquo;re not 
careful.</p> </li>

<p>Showing off is something i never give thought to as i&rsquo;ve been using a 
steel so long it&rsquo;s of a second nature to me, thinking back to last 
christmas though and the grandchildren&rsquo;s faces has just made me laugh, i 
must have looked like a samurai warrior. I am a quick learner and only cut 
myself once in my early days, not using the steel but testing the blade the 
wrong way after honing it.</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit of a wimp (unusual for me!) and when I use a steel I 
plant the tip of it firmly on the work top. I know some people can do very well 
with the brandishing action, but somehow I never quite mastered the knack. It 
always seemed like a bad idea to me to brandish a knife towards your own 
fingers.</p> </li> 
<li>  Comment by dave | 30 October 2009 @ 10:53 <br>

<p>Interesting, you just made me observe, if the small guards are in the right 
position your fingers are fairly safe, however your main wrist arteries seem to 
be in most danger, wow, Maybe too late for the turkey but that would be a good 
christmas spectacle for the family.</p> </li> 
<li>  Comment by Not Delia | 30 October 2009 @ 11:12 <br>

<p>LOL! You could always make a black pudding if you hit an artery. I know it 
looks impressive but I won&rsquo;t be starting to do the brandishing thing any 
time soon.</p> 
<p>Of course blood is also a good thickener for gravy, so don&rsquo;t worry 
about it too much. No need to waste anything.</p> </li> </ol>
