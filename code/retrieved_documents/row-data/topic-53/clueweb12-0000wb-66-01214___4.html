 A knife can be your best 
friend during food preparation, or it can cause serious injury - depending on 
your skill and what you know about knife safety. There are some basic safety 
tips and hints about using a knife properly. First of all, check 
recommendations from sources likeConsumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated. Then 
buy the best quality knives that you can afford, that have no gaps at the joint 
where the blade and handle meet, with a finely ground blade. A good knife 
should feel heavy and solid. Finally, learn how to use your good knives and 
care for them!
<p>There are five basic types of kitchen knives:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Chef's Knife</b><br>
A chef's knife is usually the largest knife in the 
kitchen, with a wide blade that is 8&quot; to 10&quot; long. Choose a knife 
that feels good and balanced in your hand. The knife should have a fulltang. 
This means that the blade should go all the way through the handle for the best 
wear and stability.</li> 
<li><b>Paring Knife</b><br>
Paring knives are generally 2-1/2-4&quot; in 
length. The most often used knife in the kitchen. It is ideal for peeling and 
coring fruits and vegetables, cutting small objects, slicing, and other hand 
tasks.</li> 
<li><b>Utility Knives</b><br>
Utility knives are longer than paring knives but 
smaller than chef's knives, usually around 5-8&quot; long. They are also called 
sandwich knives because they are just the right side for slicing meats and 
cheeses. I have several utility knives in my kitchen as 'extra' knives.</li> 
<li><b>Boning Knife</b><br>
This type of knife has a more flexible blade to 
curve around meat and bone. Generally 4-5&quot; long.</li> 
<li><b>Bread Knife</b><br>
Bread knives are usually serrated. Most experts 
recommend a serrated knife that has pointed serrations instead of wavy 
serrations for better control and longer knife life. I have two bread knives in 
my kitchen - a long 10&quot; knife that's great for cutting whole loaves, and a 
6&quot; knife perfect for cutting sandwich buns. You must use a sawing motion 
when using a serrated knife.</li> </ul> 
<p>Knives are made out of several types of material. High carbon stainless 
steel is the most expensive and will last the longest. These knives will not 
stain and holds a sharp edge longer than other steel types.Ceramic knives are 
fairly new. These knives don't need sharpening for years, and should be 
sharpened by an expert when they do wear down. Only use a ceramic knife on a 
cutting board - never on another ceramic, plastic or glass surface. They're 
that sharp!</p> 
<p>Knife handles are made of wood or a plastic composite. Both are good 
choices. The only difference is in cleaning and maintenance. Knives with wood 
handles deteriorate more quickly when cleaned in the dishwasher. I know experts 
recommend not using a dishwasher for washing knives, but I do it all the time. 
I'm not keen on washing sharp blades by hand.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Sharpening Knives</h3> 
<p>A knife that is not sharp is dangerous. It can slip off the food you're 
cutting and easily cut your fingers instead. A steel should be part of your 
knife collection. This long, round object sharpens knives by straightening out 
the edge. Take a look atusing a steel to see how to correctly sharpen your 
knives on a steel. Hold the knife in your dominant hand and the steel in the 
other, with the steel point pressed into a solid waist-high surface. Hold the 
knife base at the top of the steel at a 20 degree angle. Slowly draw the knife 
down the length of the steel, pulling the knife back so the entire blade, from 
base to tip, moves against the steel, as if you were slicing off pieces of the 
steel. Repeat on the other side. Do this five or six times , then rinse the 
knife off and dry immediately. Make sure you sharpen each side the same number 
of times to retain the knife's balance.</p>
