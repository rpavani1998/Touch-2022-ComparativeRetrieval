<p>Story - The only reason I got this one is that knife collector's itch. I've 
had to have<em>the mint SH2</em> in my collection :) That's it. Oh, almost 
forgot, it has different handle texture and color, which makes it more 
justified buy. For the record I've had to search for this baby over the period 
of 3 months, and ended up paying almost the double of the original price tag. 
Which should give you an idea regarding the availability and market price of 
the old Busse blades, INFI or not. Although, this one isINFI steel. Not that 
the new ones are easy to get, but everything is relative, thus the new blades 
can be considered as<em>easy to get</em>. Obviously this knife is no user, I 
mean for me it is not a user. Otherwise there are a lot of people out there who 
consider keeping a mint Busse to be a sin ;) My excuse would be that I have 5 
steel hearts by now,5/16&quot; SH2, this SH2, Ghost SH2, SH E and the ZT SH. 
Since this is a collector piece I won't be writing more here, as I've written 
quite a bit about all the other SHs I have in my collection.</p>
