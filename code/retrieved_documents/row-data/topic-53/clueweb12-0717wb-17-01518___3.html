subject: Knifes: the edge of reason <br>
<br>
Knives are the sexiest of all 
kitchen implements. Dangerous, elegant and unquestionably macho, it&#146;s no 
wonder that a good knife set is top of the shopping list for any would-be 
culinary god.<br>
<br>
 &#147;There are a few rules to choosing a good 
knife,&#148; says Caroline Waldegrave, managing director of Leiths School of 
Food and Wine. &#147;You should go for as heavy a knife as you can cope with, 
because it&#146;s going to be better quality.&#148; And when it comes to 
knives, you get what you pay for, so expect your wallet to feel the pain.<br>

<br> Heft the knife in your hand to make sure it&#146;s comfortable. Then try 
pivoting it on your palm, at the point where the blade meets the handle. A good 
knife will have a handle just heavier than the blade and will fall back gently 
into your hand. The end of the blade that extends into the handle is called the 
tang. Make sure it runs the whole length of the handle, for best balance and 
strength. &#147;If it&#146;s riveted, it will fall apart,&#148; warns 
Waldegrave.<br>
<br>
 When it comes to materials, ceramic, carbon steel and 
stainless steel all have their aficionados. Global knives, the choice of many 
professional chefs, are made from ice-tempered steel and constructed on the 
same principle as samurai swords. Waldegrave favours high-carbon stainless 
steel. &#147;It stays sharp for longer. The disadvantage is that it rusts 
easily, so you should wash it by hand and dry it quickly.&#148; It goes without 
saying that good knives should never see the inside of a dishwasher.<br>
<br>
 
Ceramic knives are the latest and grooviest addition to the knife block: light 
and lethally sharp, they hold an edge for years, but you can&#146;t sharpen 
them at home, so they will probably have to go back to the manufacturer when 
they need a new edge. The Japanese firm Kyocera leads the field.<br>
<br>
 
Sabatier, Henckels and Victorinox are other brands to look out for. Whichever 
you choose, make sure your knife sharpener is made of the same material as your 
chosen knives. For that reason, it&#146;s probably sensible to get all your 
knives from the same manufacturer.<br>
<br>
 While it may be tempting to buy a 
huge knife block gleaming with dozens of deadly implements, you will probably 
be wasting your money. By all means get a knife block &#151; chucking knives 
into a drawer is the fastest way to dull their edge &#151; but fill it yourself.
<br> <br>
 The essential knives no cook should be without include a cook&#146;s 
knife (go as long as you can, up to 30cm &#151; you&#146;ll work faster once 
you&#146;re used to it); a 10cm paring knife; a boning knife, used like a 
dagger to take bones out of meat; a filleting knife with a thin, pliable blade 
for filleting fish; a serrated fruit knife (works for softer vegetables too); 
and a bread knife. Alas, despite its macho allure, a meat cleaver remains 
strictly optional for the domestic cook.<br>
