 Before you 
can consider whether to splurge or save on kitchen knives, you need to 
understand the differences in knife composition and how they affect the bottom 
line. This will help you muddle through the vast range of knife prices to find 
a set that meets your needs and budget.<br>
<br>
 While you can generally feel 
the difference quality makes in a knife just by holding it in your hand, how 
well the blade will hold its edge or how long it will last, is not always that 
evident. Since most consumers don't usually conduct handling comparisons in the 
storebefore buying knives, it's best to know the qualities of a good knife, to 
get the best value for your money.<br>
<br>
<b>Knife Blade Composition</b> <br>

<br> The blade of course, is the most important knife component. It affects 
cutting performance, as well as durability and handling. Knife blades are 
either stamped - cut or punched from a sheet of steel, or forged - metal is 
shaped or formed after being heated. A forged blade is much stronger and more 
expensive. This type of blade iseasier to sharpen and holds its edge longer. 
<br> <br>
 Blade materials include various composites of steel and the higher 
the steel quality (such as in German or Japanese steel), the more durable the 
knife. A high quality stainless will also reduce the risk of pitting and 
staining.Ceramic knife blades are a different breed altogether. They're pricey 
and require special care and storing.<br>
<br>
 Knife blades are either partial 
or full tang. A full tang blade that extends into the handle is the best. It 
gives the knife balance and durability.<br>
<br>
 Blades can have various 
serrated patterns or have a straight edge, with or without abevel. A serrated 
edge is great for slicing bread or tomatoes and this blade type usually stays 
sharp a long time. Unlike a straight edge, serrated blades usually are not 
sharpened because the process is very tedious and requires special sharpening 
tools. They are however, more economical. On the other hand, a straight edge 
knife can be sharpened and the blade restored as required.<br>
<br>
 An 
extension of the blade and a component that signals a better knife and 
increases the value, is a well-defined, comfortablebolster. <br>

<b>Knife Handle Construction</b> <br>
<br>
 
Once the preferred handle, wood has lost some popularity of late, mostly 
because of the care needed to keep this natural material in good condition. A 
wooden handled knife should never be subjected to long periods of excess heat 
or water, nor should it be cleaned in a dishwasher.<br>
<br>
For this reason, 
more durable poly composites or stainless handles which may or may not be more 
economical depending on the specific construction, more easily fit into our 
busy homes. Some compositions look and feel like wood, but are easy to care 
for. A smooth, stainless handle is considered the best type for inhibiting 
bacterial growth, since this design is easier to wash and has no crevices.<br>

<br> How the handle is attached to the blade is important for a durable knife. 
A knife with a full tang, attached to the handle with three rivets, is the 
preferred design. Handle shape affects control as well as comfort. Before 
buying quality knives, I'd recommend handling them to see how they fit and feel 
in your hand.<br>

<b>A Well-Balanced Knife</b> <br>
<br>
 A high quality 
full-tang knife will be constructed to achieve a perfect balance in the hand. 
Ultimately, balance affects control which in turn improves performance and 
safety. This is one knife detail that is well worth the extra cost. A cheaper 
knife, though functional, will not usually be well-balanced.<br>
<br>
<b>Knife 
Brands &amp; Prices</b> <br>
<br>
 As with other consumer goods, a major brand 
name can be considered a status symbol and it's no different with knives. In 
other words, paying at the extreme high end of the price range for good knives, 
does not necessarily guarantee better performance than what you would get with 
those in the mid to high range.<br>
<br>
<b>So, Should You Splurge or Save on 
Knives?</b> <br>
<br>
 When you're faced with your first knife purchase, 
consider your needs - whether singles or a knife set would be more practical. 
Regardless of whether you're a chef-in-training or simply want functional 
kitchen tools to prepare meals, quality knives do improve performance, will 
last longer, are more comfortable in the hand and are often safer.<br>
<br>
 
However, not everyone can afford a pricey set of knives and you can always 
upgrade your set, or even singles as the budget allows. Some households have 
functioned for years with a basic, economical set of cutlery knives. When buying
starter knives, you can often find cheaper models with at least full-tang blades
,bolsters, sturdy handles and stainless compositions. And though serrated 
blades are very handy, a straight edge can more easily be sharpened. When 
buying knives, remember to factor in the cost of essential knife accessories 
such asstorage, a knife steel and one or two cutting boards. Proper knife 
storage is extremely important as it helps to protect the edge, as well as the 
knife point. <br>
<br>
 When you do upgrade to a better quality knife, you'll 
immediately know it. As with18/0 and 18/10 flatware, or single-layer versus 
encapsulated cookware, you can feel the difference quality makes, see improved 
performance and enjoy your investment for years to come.<br>

<b>Ceramic Knives:</b> <br>

<br> Ceramic knives can also be considered specialty knives simply because of 
their different nature, since their use and care differs from the traditional 
steel kitchen knives. There's also less choice when it comes to ceramic knives 
and it's essential that you know what you can do with one and how to care for 
them.<br>
