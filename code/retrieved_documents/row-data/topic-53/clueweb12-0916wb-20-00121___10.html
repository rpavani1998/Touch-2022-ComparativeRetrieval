<h2>Levi Says &ldquo;Take Me Fishing&rdquo;</h2> Published November 29, 2011 | 
By LifeWithLevi <br>

<p>I loooooooooove to go fishing. In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the things Jason 
and I did on our honeymoon.</p> 
<p>Minnesota is the land of 10,000+ lakes, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that 
fishing is a big sport around here. We have a lake right by our house, so of 
course I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the chance to take Levi on his first fishing 
trip.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I recently took the Angler&rsquo;s Legacy Pledge, which involves sharing my 
love of fishing with one new person each year. Who better to share it with than 
the center of my life?</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>As an Anglers&rsquo; Legacy Ambassador, <br>
I pledge to share my love 
of fishing<br>
with at least one new person each year; <br>
to pass on 
traditional skills and earned knowledge;<br>
to pay forward the thrill of 
fishing<br>
with friends and family, <br>
my love of the great outdoors and my 
<br>commitment to a healthy environment; <br>
and to give back what someone 
once gave me &ndash;<br>
the special gift of fishing.</b></p> </blockquote> 
<p>What a lot of people don&rsquo;t know is that the funds raised from the 
sale of fishing licenses goes to support natural resource conservation efforts. 
See? Drinking beer on a boat<em>DOES </em>do some good!</p> 
<p>Of course, there was no beer for Levi and I &ndash; just some great gear 
fromBass Pro Shops and a gorgeous Minnesota lake.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I was able to teach Levi about all the cool gear involved in fishing, like 
this coolShakespeare Ugly Stik Rod &amp; Reel combo.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>He was pretty fascinated with the different bobbers, too. Word of caution 
&ndash; small round bobbers are a choking hazard for curious toddlers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Jason came out to the lake with us to help. He held Levi while I cast the 
line, then brought him over so he could &ldquo;help&rdquo; me fish. Jason was 
also in charge of the most important part &ndash; taking pictures!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With so many lakes in the area, I know that next summer, when Levi&rsquo;s 
a bit older, we&rsquo;ll spend even more time fishing, especially out on our 
pontoon boat.</p> 
<p>One of the best parts about fishing is that it can be a fairly inexpensive 
hobby. Here in MN, you can buy a family fishing license, which saves on the 
cost of buying individual licenses for everyone (not that Levi needs one at his 
age yet), worms are cheap, and you can pick up a rod, reel, hooks, and other 
basics for minimal cost at outdoor stores likeBass Pro Shops.</p> 
<p>More important than the cost savings for a family outing, though, are the 
lifelong memories I&rsquo;ll get to share with my son. I can&rsquo;t wait to 
get back out to the water in the spring with Jason and Levi. We&rsquo;ll have 
to make good on the Pledge &ndash; someone has to take photos of all of us 
fishing together, right?</p>

<h2>The Secret To A Flaky Pie Crust</h2> Published November 28, 2011 | By 
LifeWithLevi <br>

<p>The secret to a flaky pie crust is all in the butter.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Homemade pie crust is super easy to make. All you need are 3-4 ingredients: 
Flour, butter, salt, and sugar (optional).</p> 
<p>The key to getting your pie crust to turn out nice and light and flaky is 
in keeping everything cold. Your water should be ice cold to start. Your mixing 
bowl should be chilled. And your butter should be frozen.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s right, frozen. <strong>Frozen butter makes great pie crust
</strong>.</p> 
<p>There are two methods to getting the butter just right for your homemade 
pie crust. I&rsquo;ll show you both ways here.</p> 
<h2>Jen&rsquo;s Flaky Pie Crust</h2> 
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 1/4 C Flour</li> 
<li>1/2 C Unsalted Butter (1 stick), frozen</li> 
<li>1/2 C Water, chilled</li> 
<li>1 tsp. Salt</li> 
<li>1 tsp. Sugar (optional)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p> 
<p>In a chilled mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Place the 
bowl back in the refrigerator.</p> 
<p>Take your butter out of the freezer and chop it into tiny little pieces. As 
I mentioned before, there are two methods of doing this.</p> 
<p><strong>1) The cheese grater method</strong></p> 
<p>Use a dishtowel or potholder to hold the butter as you grate it on your 
cheese grater&rsquo;s largest setting. This will help prevent melting from the 
warmth of your hands.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As little piles of butter flakes build up, use a knife to transfer them 
onto a plate and stick them back in the freezer. Continue this process until 
the whole stick of butter has been grated.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>2) The chopping method</strong></p> 
<p>As you can imagine, you don&rsquo;t need a cheese grater to get small 
chunks of butter. You can use your regular knife to chop it up into small 
pieces.</p> 
<p>Just be mindful that you&rsquo;re chopping frozen butter, which is much 
harder than room temperature or refrigerated butter (aka, be careful with your 
knife).</p> 
<p>I like to use my chopping knife from Shenzhen Knives for this step. The 
ceramic blade doesn&rsquo;t stick to the butter, which is important since I 
want to cut through it as quickly as possible without touching it to get it off 
the knife (that transfers heat, which will make the butter melt.) It&rsquo;s 
also very lightweight and easy to cut with.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Once your butter is chopped into small cubes, place it back in the freezer 
for a minute or two.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Grab your bowl of dry ingredients and your butter. Add the butter to the 
dry ingredients by &ldquo;cutting in&rdquo; &ndash; adding the butter a little 
at a time and using a knife or spatula to cut it apart as you mix it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>After your butter has been mixed in, slowly add your cold water to the 
mixture, 1 Tablespoon at a time. Add just enough water to make a dough ball 
that isn&rsquo;t too sticky.</p> 
<p>Flour your work surface and quickly knead your pie crust dough until it 
starts to smooth out. It&rsquo;s helpful if you chill your hands before working 
with the dough.</p> 
<p>Lightly flour the dough ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to 
chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour, up to 12 hours. (I usually 
skip this step and my pies still turn out great.)</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Roll out your pie crust on a generously floured work surface. This recipe 
is supposed to make one 9&rdquo; pie crust, but I find that it makes one nice 
bottom crust, and just enough for a very loose lattice on top. You can freeze 
your pie crusts to use later or use immediately for a delicious, flaky treat.

<h3>More about Shenzhen Knives:</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Shenzhen Ceramic Knives</strong> can be used by anyone for most 
slicing and cutting needs. These<strong>ceramic knives </strong>are made of an 
advanced ceramic calledzirconia, the second hardest material known to man next 
to diamond.</p> 
<p>The material&rsquo;s properties make it particularly resistant to wear and 
tear, which means that a<strong>ceramic blade </strong>can hold its edge much 
longer than a steel blade without the need for re-sharpening as often as steel 
knives.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>They are rust-proof and have no metallic smell or taste. They do require a 
little bit of extra care, and technically, you&rsquo;re not supposed to use 
them to slice frozen foods. I was still able to slice through my butter, since 
butter doesn&rsquo;t have much water content so it doesn&rsquo;t freeze 
completely solid. I do love it for other cooking needs, like slicing vegetables 
and meat.</p>
