<h3> Corso Como: Ballasox Stretch Flat Shoes Giveaway </h3> <strong>This 
giveaway is now closed. Congratulations to the lucky winner - Julie #245!
</strong> <br>
 I am in love with the Ballasox Stretch Flats from Corso Como. I 
want them in EVERY color. And I mean EVERY color - they offer so many!!! I 
loved seeing their wonderful and fun variety. I received them ingold and 
they're fantastic.<br>
<br>
These shoes are unbelievably comfortable. I just 
love slipping into a comfy pair flats - so cute and feminine. Definitely my 
favorite pair of shoes so far this year. I know I'll be a fan ofCorso Como for 
years to come.<br>
<br>
<em>If heaven were a shoe, it would look something like 
this. The Festive is one of two styles fromCorso Como&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;
Ballasox&rdquo; line, which takes the flat to a new level of blissful comfort 
with the introduction of a soft, form-fitting sock sewn into the lining of a 
butter skin leather upper and cushy rubber sole. Anything else that feels this 
good tends to be illegal. Each pair comes with its own carrying pouch.</em> <br>
<br> One lucky winner will with the Ballasox Stretch Flat Shoes of their choice.

popular, but with all of their choices, you really can't go wrong with any of

<h3> Peaceable Kingdom: 4 Classic Card Games for Modern Kids Giveaway </h3> 
<strong>This giveaway is now closed. Congratulations to the lucky winner - 
Elissa #31!</strong> <br>
It's no wonder the game, Fish Stix, has won numerous 
awards!<br>
<br>
&bull;Parents' Choice 2009 Gold Award <br>
&bull;Dr. Toy 10 
Best Games of 2009<br>
&bull;Dr. Toy 100 Best Products of 2009 <br>
<br>
My 
kids have a blast playing this! The entire family gets in on the action and it 
truly is a lot of fun. This game is recommended for ages 6-12, 2 to 4 players. 
However, my husband and I love it, too!<br>
<br>
I think younger kids could 
grasp the concept as well. There is no reading required.<br>
<br>
Also, the 
fish tokens don't have the tendency to slide all over the scoreboards. That's 
great when you're moving around matching your fish up.<br>
<br>
<em>How to Play:
</em> <br>
<br>
<em>Fish Stix is a visual strategy game. To start, players 
place 1 fish stick in the center of a table where all players can reach it. 
Give 3 sticks, 1 scoreboard, and 6 fish tokens to each player. Players take 
turns matching fish by color and direction. For every fish matched, a player 
moves her fish tokens that number of spaces on her scoreboard. The first player 
to move all tokens to 10 wins!<br>
<br>
</em> One lucky reader will win their 4 
Classic Card Games from Peaceable Kingdom! How fun will those be?!? <br>

<h3> Red Envelope: $50 Gift Certificate Giveaway </h3> <strong>This giveaway 
is now closed. Congratulations to the lucky winner - tawnda #5!</strong> <br>
 
As spring and summer approaches, one thing comes to mind is my husband and his 
BBQ! He comes up with the mostscrumptious BBQ ever! The Personalized Grill 
Master Cutting Board from Red Envelope is a must-have. There were three designs 
for me to choose from - Big Game Bar, Sports Bar and Steakhouse. I chose the 
Steakhouse design and it turned out amazing.<br>
<br>
My husband was very 
pleased when he saw his very own personalized cutting board. I was impressed 
with this solid sugar maple board right out of the box. The moat around the 
edges is another fantastic feature. This will catch juices and prevent 
spilling. There are also built-in carrying handles underneath the board which 
are very comfortable to use. This measures 16&rdquo; x 11 &frac34;&rdquo; x 
1&rdquo;H.<br>
<br>
This cutting board is very high in quality and the 
personalization really adds that extra special touch. What a wonderful Father's 
Day gift this would make this year! Keep that in mind ladies and gents!<br>
<br>
Red Envelope is a beautiful company that offers such a wide variety of items. I 
absolutely love their jewelry. I had a really hard timechoosing an item from 
this company. I adored so many of their products. It's hard not to! This is 
definitely the place to find unique gifts.<br>

<h3> AllyZabba: TravelZabba Giveaway </h3> <strong>This giveaway is now 
closed. Congratulations to the lucky winner - Rory #4!</strong> <br>
AllyZabba
....I wish I had known about this company when my kids were babies. I love the 
look of their plush and adorable blankets! They are simply gorgeous!<br>
<br>

<strong>The AllyZabba Way<br>
</strong> <br>
<em>At AllyZabba, we craft each 
reversible baby blanket with both a silky and plush fabric to provide comfort 
and care to each child. Designed specifically to replicate the texture of a 
mother&rsquo;s womb, our soft, silky blankets are created for babies, newborns 
and children of all ages.<br>
<br>
A grateful doula recently sent over the 
following praise for AllyZabba&rsquo;s unique creations:<br>

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this one right. I use silky blankets with my 
client&rsquo;s children and once the kids see the blanket they start getting 
sleepy. A silky blanket is the one thing I tell new parents that they actually 
need for their newborn.&rdquo;</em> <br>
<br>
By popular demand we introduce: 
TheMegaZabba. <br>
<br>
The AllyZabba MegaZabba is a gigantic squish of soft 
you can share with your tiny tot and the rest of the family! This blanket is 
huge&ndash;nearly 25 square feet of cozy goodness! It&rsquo;s perfect for 
throwing on the back of the couch or cuddling up while watching a movie. Why 
should babies have all the fun?<br>
<br>
The MegaZabba is made from the same 
great stuff as our signature blanket but the colors have been upgraded for 
adults. Classy chocolate for the plush fabric side and a choco-dot pattern or 
classy aloha print in your choice of colors for the silky satin backing. As 
always, machine washable.<br>
<br>
The MegaZabba is huge. Approx. 
58&Prime;x58&Prime;<br>
<br>
AllyZabba Pastel-Dot <br>
<br>
The AllyZabba is 
our signature pastel-dot blanket that started it all. Each time we took our new 
baby out wrapped in this trendy baby blanket we got so many comments on it. It 
is the coziest blanket&hellip;perfect for those middle of the night feedings.
<br> <br>
The AllyZabba Blanket is made of raised plush fabric and silky satin 
backing and is machine washable. It&rsquo;s incredibly soft and cozy. All color 
variations of The AllyZabba are offered in our traditional multi-colored retro 
dot backing or our new multicolored &ldquo;Choco-Dot&rdquo; backing.<br>
<br>

The large AllyZabba is approx. 34&Prime; x 28&Prime; and the smaller 
TravelZabba is 16&Prime; x 14&Prime; and is a perfect lovey for the car seat or 
stroller.<br>
<br>
The blankets from AllyZabba are so incredibly special and 
unique. I would love to be able to wrap a baby, or myself, in one of these!<br>

<br> One lucky reader will win a TravelZabba of their choice!

you love.<br>

<h3> Veripur Hand Sanitizer Moisturizer </h3> <em></em> <br>

<p>I'm a hand sanitizing freak. You can always find me fighting germs! I was 
very happy to try out Veripur's Hand Sanitizer Moisturizer. This sanitizer is 
great to use during the cold and flu season.<br>
<br>
Most hand sanitizers 
leave my hands dry and smelly. However, Veripur's sanitizer leaves my hands 
feeling nice, moisturized and fragrance-free. This non-drying, alcohol-free 
hand sanitizer that kills 99.9% of germs on contact and continues to protect 
your hands for up to four hours after application. You can findVeripur Hand 
Sanitizer Moisturizer exclusively in Walgreens. Pick some up today and feel the 
difference!<br>
<br>
<em>The majority of hand sanitizers currently on shelves 
use alcohol to disinfect hands but they do not continue to protect hands after 
application. The alcohol evaporates quickly after use so your hands are not 
protected after application. Moreover, these alcohol-based sanitizers dry the 
skin leaving it even more susceptible to germs. VERIPUR&trade; is alcohol free 
and with the added hydrating ingredients including avocado, jojoba and grape 
seed oil, VERIPUR&trade; also performs double duty as a daily moisturizer.</em>
<em> <br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>How VERIPUR&trade; with SafetyDerm&reg; patented technology works: </em>
<br></p> <em></em> 
<p><em>&bull; Deeply cleans and disinfects the skin <br>
&bull; Creates an 
invisible, undetectable shield on the surface of the skin that kills 99.9% of 
germs on contact and then continues to fight germs for four hours<br>
<br>

VERIPUR&trade; Benefits:</em></p> 
<p><em>&bull; Kills 99.9% of germs upon application <br>
&bull; Four Hour 
Continuous germ protection after application<br>
&bull; Non-drying, alcohol free
<br>&bull; Contains hydrating moisturizers <br>
&bull; Helps prevent the spread 
of germs<br>
&bull; Tested and proven effective against 20 commonly found 
strains of bacteria and four viruses<br>
&bull; Convenient size for travel and 
to bring anywhere &ndash; the home, office, beach, sporting events and gym<br>

<br>&ldquo;I wrote this review while participating in a Mom Central Consulting 
blog tour on behalf of Veripur Hand Sanitizer Moisturizer. I received a Veripur 
product sample and a gift card to thank me for taking the time to 
participate.&rdquo;</em></p> <br>

<h3> Choccreate: Gift Certificate Giveaway </h3> <strong>This giveaway is now 
closed. Congratulations to the lucky winner - Erin #76!</strong> <br>
 I have 
never heard of customizing your own chocolate, so when I heard about 
Choccreate, I about died and went to heaven. I created three wonderful 
varieties that I just have to share with you.<br>
<br>
I chose to use 
stawberries and mangoes in white chocolate. My husband was in love. White 
chocolate is his favorite and the combination of fruity pieces was delicious. 
It's now his favorite chocolate. It's going to be hard to top this one for him.
<br> <br>
The next variety was milk chocolate with bananas and peanuts. YUM! It 
was so good. And finally, dark chocolate with candied almonds. All three were 
fantastic. We ate them up so fast here in my home.<br>
<br>
The chocolate bars 
all came individually wrapped and placed in an adorable gift box tied with a 
pink satin ribbon. The presentation was so pretty. I almost didn't want to open 
the box, but with chocolate that looked that great, I had to give in no matter 
how gorgeous the box!<br>
<br>
Click here to see all of the choices you have 
for customization! WOW! I had no idea some of these could be used in chocolate.
<br> <br>
You can also purchase gift certificates from Choccreate. What 
excellent gifts these would make!<br>
<br>
Choccreate would like to offer one 
lucky reader a $12 Gift Certificate!<br>
<br>
<strong>MANDATORY ENTRY:</strong> 
Visit Choccreate and tell me how you would create your chocolate.<br>

<h3> ProFlowers: $50 Gift Certificate Giveaway </h3> <strong>This giveaway is 
now closed. Congratulations to the lucky winner - Sarah Matos #185!</strong> 
<br>  I was sent the most gorgeous plant in the mail today. The Ultimate Office 
Plant from ProFlowers took my breath away. I never knew a plant could do that! 
<br> <br>
Talk about beautiful. It was packaged wonderfully and arrived in 
excellent condition. It was carefully placed inside a tall box and the plant 
was wrapped with care.<br>
<br>
It was much larger than I had expected which 
was a great thing. The lilies have not bloomed yet, but it still looks so 
pretty. I can't wait to see the lovely white flowers soon! It's going to look 
dynamite.<br>
<br>
You have your choice of three different containers: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Large White Pot</li> 
<li>Tapered Wooden Pot - This is what is pictured above and what I received. 
It looks sophisticated and sleek.</li> 
<li>Standard Basket </li> </ul> 
<p>This low maintenance plant looks great in my home and would look terrific 
in any office.<br>
<br>
Here's more about this plant from their website:</p> 
<p><em>Our deluxe peace lily is the perfect gift, even for those that do not 
have a green thumb. This handsome plant has white sail-like flowers that stand 
out between the shiny, dark green paddle-shaped leaves. The Spathiphyllum is a 
natural air purifier and does well indoors even in areas with little light. 
Care instructions are included.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Visit ProFlowers to see their Valentine's Day Flowers &amp; Favorites! I 
highly recommend this company for your holiday needs or anytime you want to
