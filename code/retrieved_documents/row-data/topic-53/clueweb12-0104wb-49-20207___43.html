<h1>Choosing the Right Kitchen Cutlery&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> by Johnny Shaw</em></h1>
<br> 
<p>Kitchen knives come in all sizes and shapes. Each small variation results 
in a different use. There are long ones, short ones, wide ones, narrow ones, 
curved ones, angled ones and the list goes on and on. They are made from carbon 
steel, stainless steel, stamped steel ceramic or even plastic. The better 
knives are balanced so as they are being used they do not feel awkward. By 
awkward I mean they feel heavy or light at the pointed end. Proper balance 
eases the strain on the user. Grips or handles have made great advances further 
easing the strain on the user. Sharpness is also a key factor in easing the 
strain on the user. The type of edge used for a particular cutting or slicing 
project is very important.</p>
<p>Styles </p>
<p>The size and shape of the knife determines its primary use. The cook's or 
chef's knife is used for the heavy duty cutting needed in the kitchen. It is 
normally a longer, heavy constructed knife that will handle the abuse of the 
overzealous cook. Slicing, dicing, and chopping are some of the primary uses of 
the cook's knife. The slicing knife is for use in slicing food such as ham or 
large cuts of meat. The Bread knife normally has a thin serrated blade. The 
serrated blade allows it to easily slice through a loaf of bread or a tomato 
without crushing or tearing. The steak knife is normally a smaller version of 
the slicing knife, designed for individual use. The knife used most often by 
any cook is the paring knife. It is a small knife that is easy to handle and 
can be used for cutting, peeling and dicing fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, 
etc.</p>
<p>Construction </p>
<p>The way knives are constructed determines several things. There are several 
types of material used in the manufacturing of the blade material.</p>
<p>Carbon Steel blades are made from iron with about 2% carbon. This blade is 
easily sharpened and holds its edge well. The down side of this is they tend 
rust if they are not dried immediately after washing. Over time they obtain a 
dark color considered to be the sign of a quality knife. The higher the 
percentage of carbon to iron, the better the blade. Stainless Steel blades are 
made from an alloy of iron with 10-15 % chromium, maybe some nickel and 
molybdenum with only a very small amount of carbon. This type of material 
cannot be sharpened as sharp as the carbon steel blade, but it is very 
resistant to staining and discoloration. Some people think the discoloration 
imparts a flavor into the food.</p>
<p>High Carbon Stainless Steel blades combine the best of both worlds. They do 
not discolor like the carbon blades, but they can be sharpened to a keen edge 
that is long lasting. They do not impart any flavor into your food.</p>
<p>Titanium alloy blades are lighter and more flexible than steel blades. The 
carbon in the alloy allows them to be heat treated so they will hold an edge 
well. They do not impart any flavor into your food, either.</p>
<p>Ceramic blades are made from ceramic. They are extremely hard and will hold 
their edge for a long time. They will cut the glaze on a dinner plate and 
should only be used on a cutting board. The down side is that they must be 
professionally sharpened.</p>
<p>Plastic blades are not very sharp and are specialized in the use in the 
kitchen. They are used to cut vegetables so they don't turn dark.</p>
<p>Laminate blades are made by layering different materials together. The 
number of possibilities is endless. The only way to decide if you want one of 
these types is to buy and try.</p>
<p>Steel blades are either forged or stamped. </p>
<p>Forged blades are made in a detailed process that takes a lot of time and 
is accomplished by skilled craftsman. I will not go into detail here, but this 
type of blade is more often than not preferred by chefs.</p>
<p>Stamped blades are designed to be made in mass. The quality of the metal 
used is such that it can be worked quickly into a finished product. This type 
of knife is less expensive than the forged one, but it must be replaced on a 
regular basis.</p>
<p>The Business Edge </p>
<p>The type and design of the knife edge determines how it should be used. </p>
<p>Flat ground blades are tapered from the backbone to the edge. This blade is 
very strong but is heavy.</p>
<p>Hollow ground blades look a lot like the flat ground except starting about 
halfway up the blade it is ground into a concave shape. It is weaker than the 
flat ground blade but has the advantage of being lighter.</p>
<p>The Serrated blade looks like a saw. It is ideal for cutting things that 
are hard on the outside and soft on the inside. It actually tears the food 
rather than cutting, so it should not be used for all kinds of food.</p>
<p>Handle </p>
<p>The handle of your knife can be made from an array of different materials. 
The basic handles are wood, plastic, composite and Stainless Steel.</p>
<p>Wood handles are made from hardwoods. Wooden handles are the most 
attractive and do not become slick when wet. Some individuals claim the 
porosity of the wood retains bacteria and refuse to use them. This is up to the 
individual as whether this factor is included in the decision process.</p>
<p>Plastic handles can be molded into almost any shape you can imagine. The 
modern plastic handle has evolved into ergonomically designed units designed by 
a computer. They fit your hand nicely, but a lot of pole people complain about 
the &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; concept. Also, plastic handles can be 
slippery when wet.</p>
<p>Composite handles incorporate the best of the wood and plastic materials. 
They are easy to care for and some chefs will use nothing else.</p>
<p>Stainless Steel handles are by far the most durable. They are the most 
sanitary but can be tricky to handle when wet. Manufacturers form them with 
bumps and finger grooves to help eliminate this problem.</p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>This information is not by any means everything there is to know. It should 
give you the basic information you need to make a qualified decision. There are 
many variations to the ones listed. Choosing your knife will be determined by 
several factors. How often will you use a particular knife, what will it will 
be used for, and how much are you willing to spend are just a few of the things 
you should look at. Hopefully the information given will give you a basic 
understanding and an idea of what you might look for when purchasing your 
kitchen cutlery.</p>
