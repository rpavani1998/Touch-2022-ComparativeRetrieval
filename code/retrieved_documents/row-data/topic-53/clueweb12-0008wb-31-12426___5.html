There are basically two main types of kitchen knives, the traditional steel 
blade knife and the new kid on the block, the ceramic knife. If you're a little 
confused about the differences between these two knives, you're not alone.<br>

<br> Ceramic knives tend to live a mysterious life so to speak and are very 
particular in what they can do, how they should be handled and how they should 
be stored. And these two types of knives should never, ever nest together.<br>

<br> Note that these use and care tips are provided as a general guide only and 
you should always consult the product manual for brand-specific manufacturer's 
recommendations for any knife you buy.<br>
<br>
<b>A Look at Steel Knives:</b> 
<br> <br>
 Steel knives come in various sizes, styles and steel quality. You 
can find very cheap steel knives, some of which have better qualities than 
others, with various degrees of durability. The type of steel used in regular
kitchen knives will influence how long the blades will hold their edge, as well 
as corrosion resistance and so on.<br>
<br>
A high quality kitchen knife will be
full tang, have a comfortable handle, be well-balanced and sport a forged 
high-carbon steel blade for better edge retention.<br>
<br>
 Good quality steel 
knives need proper handling and care in order to be free of rust, pitting and 
to maintain a sharp edge. That means using them for what they were intended 
for, washing by hand, drying andstoring them safely to avoid injury and damage 
to the knives. Over time, a steel knife will usually show its age from general 
use. Quality steel knives can be honed with aknife steel or sharpened to 
restore the fine edge. Note that some high-end knife manufacturers do recommend 
their knives be returned for professional sharpening.<br>
<br>
 Different 
styles of steel knives affect function when it comes to boning, slicing or 
dicing. For instance, you would use a more flexible boning knife to debone 
chicken or filet fish. And aSantoku knife is ideal for chopping, dicing and 
slicing onions, vegetables and numerous other cutting tasks. A chef's knife is 
best for carving, slicing and so on. There's quite an assortment ofblade lengths
, styles and knife features when it comes to steel knives. There's also a 
diversity ofknife handles. <br>
<br>
<b>Why Ceramic Knives Are a Different 
Breed of Knife</b> <br>
<br>
Ceramic knives on the other hand, are not as 
diverse as sizes and styles go and are generally limited to a few practical 
lengths. Quality ceramic knives are made of materials that are stronger than 
diamonds, usually zirconium oxide. Most ceramic blades are white, though there 
is a growing number of grey and black ceramic knives. The hardness of the 
ceramic gives these knives their long-lasting good looks, as well as a razor 
sharp edge that does not require sharpening for years. That is why many chefs 
love using ceramic knives. This sharpness makes slicing easier, allows precise 
cuts and extremely thin slices.<br>
<br>
 The ceramic blade is stronger than 
steel but unfortunately, is more fragile because it is more brittle. That means 
that if you drop a ceramic knife or attempt to cut bone or frozen foods with 
one, it can break or chip. Unlike steel knives which can be used for various 
slicing/dicing/chopping tasks, ceramic knives are limited in use mainly to 
slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats. According to some manufactures, 
you can slice cheese with a ceramic knife, but not all agree. And while some 
brands have limitations when it comes to certain vegetables and fruits, others 
do not list such notables. Manufacturers are looking for ways to make their 
ceramic knives more versatile and durable.<br>
<br>
 Other things that should 
be avoided is twisting, scraping or bending the ceramic blade and subjecting it 
to extreme temperatures. As for the knife handles, a well-designed ceramic 
knife will have a comfortable handle that completes the well-balanced feel, as 
well as provide a safe, sure grip. When it comes to handling, ceramic knives 
are extremely lightweight and that may appeal to many because it reduces hand 
fatigue and requires less effort for certain slicing tasks. Don't let the 
lightweight nature fool you; you can get the same great control as you would 
with a more weighty steel knife. It all depends of course on the quality and 
design of the knife.<br>
<br>
 Unlike a steel knife, a ceramic blade will not 
rust, pit or leave a metallic taste on foods. Blades will retain their sharp 
edge for a long time and must be sharpened either by the manufacturer or with a 
brand-specific specially designed ceramic knife sharpener. Because they are 
very sharp and brittle, ceramic knives must be stored in a custom sleeve or 
box. They should never be stored in a drawer with other (steel) knives. Though 
some manufacturers say their ceramic knives can be washed in a dishwasher, most 
recommend hand washing and I agree.<br>
<br>
<b>Will Ceramic Knives Replace 
Steel Knives?</b> <br>
<br>
 No, ceramic knives will never fully replace your 
traditional steel kitchen knives. That's mainly because they are limited when 
it comes to use. There's also less variety of styles and lengths of ceramic 
knives so you would still need steel knives for various cutting tasks. They are 
meant to be used for slicing only, but this may change in the future with 
industry advancements. As such, ceramic knives would nicely expand your 
selection of knives. That said, a ceramic knife might become your go-to knife 
for slicing tomatoes or vegetables, simply because of handling and performance 
preferences.<br>
<br>
 Consumers should take care not to judge a ceramic by the 
same principles they do a steel knife. They are not cut from the same cloth and 
that would be like comparing apples to peaches. As for price, ceramic knives 
may seem more expensive, but a high quality steel knife can also set you back a 
few bucks. And remember that ceramic knives require less sharpening. When it 
comes to storing, ceramic knives require a protective sheath or proper storage 
container, something that is also recommended for sharp quality steel knives.
<br> <br>
 The extra care needed for ceramic knives will probably deter some 
consumers, especially those who prefer carefree kitchen knives. The avid 
professional and home chef though, will find ceramic knives worth the care and 
they will probably have an assortment of ceramic to complement their cutlery 
essentials.<br>
