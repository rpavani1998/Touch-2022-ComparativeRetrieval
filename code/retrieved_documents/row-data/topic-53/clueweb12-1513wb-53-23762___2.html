<h4>South Paw</h4> 
<p>I gotta tell you - it is very unnerving to watch a southpaw with a knife.

<h4>Ceramic</h4> 
<p>I've been seeing Ceramic knives lately, and I got a cheap one just to see 
what it's like. It seems to slice very well, but it's a little disconcerting, 
since I think they're more fragile than steel knives. Any comments from the 
chefs?</p>

<h4>Ceramic sleek, but</h4> 
<p>One thing about ceramic knives is that you either love them or not. Some 
find them too light, too fragile. For cutting vegetables and fish, they're 
awesome, but for tougher work, they feel too fragile. Plus, the real good ones 
are very expensive. My hands are big and my grip firm, so I have not found them 
to be so comfortable, but have had students with small hands that swear by them.
</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h4>Steels</h4> 
<p>I just received a beautiful 9&quot; Wustof Cook's Knife for Christmas and 
now I'm looking into purchasing a sharpening steel to keep the blade in good 
shape. I checked out Wustof`s site and they show two types of steel: a regular 
sharpening steel and a diamond sharpener. Am I right in assuming that the 
diamond sharpener does not hone the blade and only sharpens it (I would love to 
put a question mark here but my keyboard seems to be failing me). Additionally 
what length of steel should I be investing in assuming I will be purchasing 
additional knifes as I continue my training and career (haha again question 
mark).</p>

<h4>Diamond sleek, but...</h4> 
<p>Diamond steels do actually sharpen some of the edge, and they do hone too, 
so they too have some advantages. But only if they're of very good quality. 
Wustof makes quality steels. As for length, the longer, thicker and heavier 
(really) the better. Hope this helps.</p>

<h4>Great</h4> 
<p>Thanks very much that does clarify things. I think I'll be getting a normal 
steel for now and maybe invest in those industrial diamonds down the road. 
Thanks!</p>

<h4>thanks for the videos...</h4> 
<p>particularly the step for Positioning Your Guide Hand. i damaged some 
nerves in my right hand years ago and have switched over to using my left hand 
for many different maneuvers, including transitioning knife chopping duties 
over to my left and using the right hand as the guide.</p> 
<p>in the past, i could not figure out how to hold things down and feel that 
they were secure enough for me to chop away with confidence that i won't be 
bleeding into my pile of vegetables and what-not. but watching your video, i've 
adapted your backward crab crawl into a gripping style that seems to suit me. 
could probably take some adjusting as i go along and would greatly appreciate 
anyone else's input.</p> 
<p>presently only using the middle and pointer finger as the guide. the thumb, 
pinky and ring finger now anchor. just so you know, the pinky and ring are the 
gimpy ones of the bunch. trying to bring ol' gimpy up into position with the 
middle and pointer is just very awkward, but allowing it to curl up next to the 
pinky seems to work for me so far and feels &quot;natural&quot;.</p> 
<p>if this at all sounds like a script for disaster please advise on what i 
should be doing.</p> 
<p>thank you</p>

<h4>Sounds Good Eunice</h4> 
<p>I would suggest doing 15 minutes exercises with the bench scraper for 4 or 
5 sessions (or more if needed). It's great for confidence building.</p> 
<p>As for your hand position, you seem to be on the right track. It is fine to 
adjust to another variation that is comfortable to you, just remember to find a 
position whereby if you were to slip, you simply cannot cut yourself. Safety 
first. It will become second nature in no time.</p>

<h4>I often switch hands while cooking.. </h4> 
<p>I found this particularly usefull as I quite often switch hands while 
cooking, being ambidextrous has it's advantages at times.. :-)</p>

<h4>Lasting Damage?</h4> 
<p>How worried should I be about honing my knife with a steel? I just received 
a nice set of chef's knives for Christmas and have never used a steel before. 
I'm worried about doing lasting damage by using an improper angle. Are mistakes 
easily undone or should a novice really be careful before attempting to hone a 
knife?</p>

<h4>Honing </h4> 
<p>Honing can not do any damage to your knives... In fact, unless you are 
using a diamond steel, a steel doesn't sharpen an edge. You need to do this 
with a stone. So don't worry. Follow the honing video on Rouxbe and hone every 
once and while to maintain your edge. A slight variation in angles will not do 
anything. Nice to see you're lovin' your knives though :-) a good sign.</p>

<h4>At Ease</h4> 
<p>Thanks Joe. You really put my mind at ease and I can now enjoy my new 
knives without worry.</p> 
<p>I'm a little unclear about the distinction between honing and sharpening, 
though, as it seems to be purely semantic.</p> 
<p>Also, the advice in the video is for the home chef to hone once a day. That 
seems excessive and contrary to what you suggest (&quot;every once and a 
while&quot;). I guess what I need to know is how long is too long to go without 
honing.</p> 
<p>Measuring in days does not make much sense unless the knife naturally loses 
its edge (doubtful) as some of us will not use a knife every day. Perhaps 
measuring on a per-use basis makes more sense.</p> 
<p>Any advice?</p>

<h4>For Clarity.</h4> 
<p>Honing - maintains the edge.</p> 
<p>Sharpening creates an edge once it's lost from use. And every knife will 
begin to lose it's edge with use over time.</p> 
<p>If you use your knife a lot every day, then honing everyday is the absolute 
best thing you can do. I have to admit, that I don't even do this out of 
laziness (lack of time, etc). However, I happen to lose my edge often so I have 
to use a stone. The next time you go to a butcher shop, listen for the butchers 
honing in the back. Many hone their knives before each use - why - because it 
keeps their knives sharper, longer. And you don't have to see it, you'll hear 
it.</p> 
<p>A stone has a very course surface area and it actually grinds the steel 
down. Think of sanding down the edge of a piece of wood with sand paper. Same 
thing. We'll be covering this in a few weeks so stick with us and we'll walk 
you through this too.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<h4>Glad to have found this</h4> 
<p>...because I am actually afraid of knives. For the past 18 years I have cut 
EVERYTHING with meat scissors or forced my husband to do it. He's even agreed 
to buy me a good chef's knife after I prove I am going to try to use it instead 
of wimping out and going back to my old habits.</p> 
<p>(However, he is sharpening my current one for me in the mean time.)</p> 
<p>I have been practicing with a bench scraper for about 10 minutes a day for 
the past few days. I am comfortable with that - any thoughts on transitioning 
for someone with a phobia?</p>

<h4>Re: Glad to have found this...</h4> 
<p>So glad to hear that you are practicing with the bench scraper...this is 
what will give you the feeling without the fear that you have for the knife 
blade.</p> 
<p>The only advice I would give you for transitioning is to keep practicing 
with the bench scraper until you feel really comfortable. You don't want to be 
afraid when it comes to cutting with a knife. Once you are ready to move to the 
knife, take it slow (learning is not about speed) and remember what you 
practiced. As long as you keep your fingers tucked under and you go slowly, you 
will be fine.</p> 
<p>Good luck, let us know how it goes! </p>

<h4>Bench Scraper?</h4> 
<p>Hi, I was just wondering if its essential that I get a bench scraper to get 
comfortable and build a feel for the cutting motions. I don't possess one of 
them and was just wondering if I can just start with my chefs knife.</p>

<h4>Re: Bench Scraper</h4> 
<p>If you feel totally comfortable with your chef's knife then you can 
certainly just practice with that. If not...a bench scraper is about $3 dollars 
and they are available in any kitchen store. Cheers!</p>

<h4>For Clarity</h4> 
<p>Joe,</p> 
<p>I use a steel on my knives every time I cut with them precisely BECAUSE of 
laziness. I'd rather steel them for a few seconds each time than have to spend 
the time with them on a stone. Of course steeling them doesn't stop me from 
having to do so, but it stops me having to do so very often. :)</p>

<h4>Re: More Knife Cuts</h4> 
<p>Is there some knife cut in particular that you wanted to learn? Perhaps 
down the road we will do a more advanced knife cut lesson, but the basics are 
well covered in the currentknife cut lesson. Hope this helps!</p>

<h4>Good place to buy knives in Australia</h4> 
<p>If in Australia, check out www.everten.com.au. This is an online store for 
kitchen gear.</p>

<h4>Steels??</h4> 
<p>I am getting my knives professionally sharpened tomorrow. I do not have a 
steel to keep the knife sharpened. Is this something that I absolutely need to 
run out and get immediately? Are they expensive? Also, if I do use a steel on 
my knives regularly, how often do I need to have them professionally sharpened? 
This guy that is going to do my knives does all the commercial hotels and 
restaurants around town and says that once I see what he can do with my knives 
that I won't want to use a steel, I'll just pay the $3 that he charges to get 
them resharpened. Advice appreciated!</p>
