<h1>The Italian Kitchen</h1> 
<h2>Fill Your Kitchen With the Flavors of Italy</h2> 
<p>From stocking your pantry with ingredients and cooking tools, to learning 
about the foods and cooking terms of Italy, we have all of the information you 
need to learn how to start cooking&mdash;the Italian way!</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Italian Pantry</li> 
<li>Cooking Tools</li> 
<li>Food Glossary</li> 
<li>Cooking Glossary</li> </ul> 
<p>We'd like to share with you our recommendations for the key items you 
should always have stocked in your pantry to make an authentic Italian pasta 
meal. Whether alone or in the company of family or friends, the Italian table 
is a daily celebration of the enjoyment and nourishment received from a 
deliciously prepared meal. Of course, the number-one rule of great Italian 
cuisine is &quot;fresh is best.&quot;</p> 
<p>Italians shop daily at local fresh markets, choosing farm-fresh, seasonal 
ingredients. The ingredients they choose in the morning are on their tables 
that evening, for meals that are bursting with flavor. We recommend keeping on 
hand fresh ingredients that follow the seasons and harvests&mdash;you'll love 
the authentic Italian flavor it brings to your meals.</p>

<h3>Basic Tools</h3> 
<p>Whether you are a novice or a gourmet enthusiast, there are some kitchen 
tools that are essential for making authentic Italian meals. Start by stocking 
your kitchen with the basics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Pepper mill</li> 
<li>Cheese grater</li> 
<li>Chef's knife &ndash; stainless steel blades are preferred</li> 
<li>Paring knife</li> 
<li>Vegetable peeler</li> 
<li>An assortment of ladles, wooden spoons, spatulas, tongs, wire whisks</li> 
<li>Pasta fork</li> 
<li>Cutting boards &ndash; remember to use separate boards for vegetables and 
meats</li> 
<li>Measuring cups and spoons (for both dry and wet measures)</li> 
<li>Skimmer</li> 
<li>Mortar &amp; pestle</li> 
<li>Lasagne pan (ceramic or glass Pyrex) &ndash; 13&quot; x 9&quot; x 2-3&quot;
</li> 
<li>Colander</li> 
<li>Saute pan &ndash; 12&quot; lined copper is the best, but expensive; better 
choices include stainless steel wrapped aluminum or high-quality nonstick with 
a long handle</li> 
<li>Stockpot &ndash; 8 quart, we recommend stainless steel with sturdy handles
</li> 
<li>OPTIONAL ADDITIONS: kitchen scale, 2-quart saucepan, stainless steel with 
a thick, heavy bottom</li> </ul> 
<h3>The Details</h3> 
<p>Once you have all of the basics covered, explore a few of these time-saving 
tools.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> Chopping Boards </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Bread Board</h4> 
<p>Usually made of wood, a bread board has channels around its perimeter to 
collect crumbs. Some boards have two parts: a removable, slotted tray and a 
board beneath it to catch excess crumbs. Boards with a small channel near the 
edges are often used to collect gravy when cutting meat roasts.</p> 
<h4>Cheese Board</h4> 
<p>A cheese board usually has a marble surface on which to cut the cheese and 
a wooden part to serve the cheese slices. These convenient boards often have a 
wire cutter built in to ensure smooth cheese slices.</p> 
<h4>Marble Chopping Board</h4> 
<p>A marble chopping board is perfect for cutting meat, cured meats, and 
vegetables.</p> 
<h4>Plastic Chopping Board</h4> 
<p>Many types of plastic materials, such as polypropylene, are used for 
cutting boards because they are sanitary, durable, and highly resistant to heat 
and scratches. Since plastic has a high concentration of molecules, food 
residues do not stick to its smooth surface, which has no holes or 
irregularities where bacteria can settle. It is becoming increasingly 
commonplace to choose different colored boards for different types of foods to 
prevent cross-contamination: yellow for poultry, green for produce, and red for 
raw meat, etc.</p> 
<h4>Wood Chopping Board</h4> 
<p>Wood chopping boards have evolved from a thick, heavy block of wood that 
butchers used to prepare cuts of meat to lightweight boards that easily can be 
moved around the kitchen. Today, the majority of chopping boards used in the 
home are made from wood. Wood boards usually are made from thick blocks and 
stumps, which are more resistant than plastic and are used for pieces of meat 
that require a certain amount of force.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Colanders and Skimmers </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Colander</h4> 
<p>This versatile, everyday utensil&mdash;a bowl with feet and draining 
holes&mdash;has remained relatively unchanged throughout time. For the most 
part, the metal enamel type has been replaced by stainless steel and 
heat-resistant plastic versions. A colander, used for draining pasta should 
have equally distributed holes no larger than the size of a pea almost up to 
the rim.</p> 
<h4>Skimmer</h4> 
<p>This type of flat ladle, which is pierced with holes, is used to remove 
foam, scum, or grease from the surface of a liquid, or remove pasta, such as 
ravioli or gnocchi from boiling water. Close cousins of skimmers, metal wire 
strainer ladles have a more concave shape to fish out small fried objects from 
boiling oil.</p> 
<h4>Strainer</h4> 
<p>Sieves and strainers are used to filter small quantities and to sieve 
powdered foods (e.g., flour). Nylon is the preferred material for filtering 
acidic liquids such as lemon juice. Due to its characteristic cone shape, a 
chinois will strain anything from a disastrously lumpy b&eacute;chamel sauce to 
a velvety sauce.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Electric Mixers </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Beater</h4> 
<p>The beater, or handheld mixer, is really an electric whisk. It's ideal for 
small quantities and allows greater flexibility in the positioning of the 
whisk, which can be changed quickly.</p> 
<h4>Blender</h4> 
<p>A glass blender is used to prepare small quantities of liquid and 
semi-liquid foods (as well as crushed ice); an immersion blender is 
particularly useful for whisking soups and sauces directly in the pot.</p> 
<h4>Centrifugal Mixer</h4> 
<p>The centrifugal mixer often is used to make healthy vegetarian recipes, 
such as fruit or vegetable juice. After fruit and vegetables are reduced, the 
centrifugal force ensures that the juice is separated from the pulp, which is 
strained into a receptacle. The end result is clear, pure juice.</p> 
<h4>Stand Mixer</h4> 
<p>This multifunction device is more powerful than a hand mixer and has the 
additional benefit of being hands free. Stand mixers offer a variety of 
attachments including beaters for mixing all types of batters, dough hooks for 
kneading heavy dough, and whisks for whipping lighter batters.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Kitchen Thermometers </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Dial Thermometer</h4> 
<p>A food thermometer can prove to be very useful in today's kitchen, helping 
cooks avoid over- or undercooking dishes and thus, ensuring full-flavored food. 
Dial thermometers, which measure temperature within five seconds, are sold by 
most kitchen-supply stores and grocery stores. They cover different temperature 
ranges, which are indicated on a dial at the top of a long metal rod. Dial 
thermometers can stand up to oven temperatures and are perfect for large roasts 
and poultry. Smaller dial thermometers that offer an immediate temperature 
measurement are not made to withstand oven temperatures, but to check the 
temperature of foods once they are cooked.</p> 
<h4>Digital Thermometer</h4> 
<p>Digital thermometers can be purchased in kitchen-supply stores or larger 
grocery stores. They feature a small readout screen that shows temperature at 
the top of a long metal rod. Like dial thermometers, these battery-operated 
food thermometers are capable of measuring temperatures in about five seconds. 
To check the temperature once cooking time has elapsed, they must be inserted 
into the food. Located at the tip of the probe, the sensor is perfect for 
measuring the temperature of thin items, like hamburger patties and chicken 
breasts. These thermometers are not designed to withstand oven temperatures and 
should not be immersed in water.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Knives </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Boning Knife</h4> 
<p>This fairly &quot;technical&quot; knife, which always must be kept sharp, 
has a characteristic non-rigid and elastic blade that makes it ideal for 
trimming meat from the bone or separating the skin from the flesh of fish.</p> 
<h4>Chef's Knife</h4> 
<p>The jack-of-all-blades, this knife can be used for almost any purpose with 
the exception of &quot;fine work&quot; (e.g., peeling). It is used to cut and 
slice meat, cut vegetables into strips and cubes, and grind and crush garlic, 
among other applications. The most popular sizes for domestic use range from 4 
to 12 inches.</p> 
<h4>Cleaver</h4> 
<p>The heaviest knife, a cleaver has a wide blade (at least 6 inches), which 
is rectangular in shape and fairly heavy. It is used to cut bones or legs of 
meat as well as leeks and small onions.</p> 
<h4>Mezzaluna</h4> 
<p>This crescent-shaped knife with a handle on either side makes mincing and 
fine chopping much easier.</p> 
<h4>Paring Knife</h4> 
<p>This all-purpose knife (3-4 inches) is used for peeling fruit and 
vegetables, as well as slicing and other jobs for which long-bladed knives 
would be too cumbersome.</p> 
<h4>Serrated Knife</h4> 
<p>This knife can cut bread with its long blade, but it also is very useful 
for cutting up hard foods such as Parmigiano cheese.</p> 
<h4>Stainless Steel Knives</h4> 
<p>The most widely used types of knives are those with a stainless steel 
blade, which have a treated wooden or plastic handle and are dishwasher safe. 
Modern Japanese knives have extremely sharp ceramic blades that do not lose 
their edge or absorb smells.</p> 
<h4>Utility Knife</h4> 
<p>A cross between a paring knife and a chef's knife, this all-purpose knife 
is designed for a variety of everyday tasks. It usually has a 6-inch blade.</p> 
</dd> 
<dt> Ladles and Spatulas </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Sauce Ladle</h4> 
<p>Once made of copper, ladles in today's kitchens are usually stainless 
steel. They mainly are used for transferring liquid or semi-liquid foods from 
one receptacle to another. Characterized by a long handle with a hook at one 
end and a semi-spherical bowl at the other, the classic shape of ladles changes 
in size and dimension depending on use.</p> 
<h4>Soup Ladle</h4> 
<p>Ideal for serving both thin and thick soups, the soup ladle has a 6-ounce 
bowl characterized by a rounded edge that doesn't need to be drained.</p> 
<h4>Spatula</h4> 
<p>Gourmets and professional cooks prefer to use spatulas over spoons because 
they are so versatile and food does not stick to them. Spatulas can remove 
portions of food quickly and there is no risk of damage to saucepans with a 
nonstick base.</p> 
<h4>Wok Ladle</h4> 
<p>With its shallow, wide bowl, the wok ladle is suitable for stirring and 
mixing foods as they cook, while its long handle allows you to keep your 
distance from the heat source.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Cookware Materials </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Aluminum</h4> 
<p>Easily the lightest and most convenient metal to use in cooking, aluminum 
conducts heat well. However, aluminum tools are not ideal because they lose 
their shape easily, tend to blacken, and give foods a metallic taste. Anodized 
aluminum models have resolved the blackening problem and are much more 
resistant. Aluminum utensils should not be cleaned with abrasive materials and 
should not be put in the dishwasher.</p> 
<h4>Cast Iron</h4> 
<p>The best heat conductor and accumulator, cast iron is the best choice for 
dishes that require extended cooking times on low heat. Due to its heavy 
weight, cast iron may be difficult to manage in everyday situations. Cast iron 
cookware should be washed with hot water and soap, without using abrasive 
materials; stubborn stains can be removed with soaking. If the cast iron is not 
seasoned it may rust; follow the manufacturer's instructions.</p> 
<h4>Copper</h4> 
<p>Copper conducts heat quickly and efficiently and has a practically 
limitless lifespan. Unless coated, copper pans tend to discolor and react with 
the flavor of some foods if left in contact too long. Copper pans should be 
washed with hot water and detergent, without using abrasive materials; if there 
are any stubborn spots the pan can be left to soak.</p> 
<h4>Earthenware</h4> 
<p>Like cast iron, earthenware is a suitable material for slow cooking and for 
the oven because it transmits and accumulates heat well. Although it does not 
interact with the food, earthenware is affected by rapid changes in temperature 
and has a tendency to split. Before using earthenware pots for the first time, 
leave them to soak overnight or, if possible, for a whole day. They can be 
washed in water and detergent but should not be rubbed with abrasive materials. 
If possible, avoid dishwashers.</p> 
<h4>Porcelain</h4> 
<p>Although delicate, difficult to handle, and often short-lived, porcelain 
pans retain heat well and are attractive and easy to clean.</p> 
<h4>Stainless Steel</h4> 
<p>Stainless steel is perhaps the most widespread material for pans. Nickel 
and chrome, which do not affect conductivity, are responsible for its 
versatility and durability. Stainless steel pans can be washed in hot water and 
detergent or left to soak if there are any stubborn residues. In more serious 
cases, they can be wiped with stainless steel wool.</p> 
<h4>Heat-Resistant Glass</h4> 
<p>Better known as Pyrex, heat-resistant glass is hygienic and easy to clean. 
Usually used for cooking in the oven, Pyrex dishes should not come into direct 
contact with flames.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Pots &amp; Pans </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Braising Pan</h4> 
<p>The goal of braising is to have the ingredients (such as stews, lamb 
shanks, or chunks of beef) slowly cook in their own juices. This pan usually 
has a heavy weight and a heavy lid, both of which help contain heat. A good 
choice is an oval pan with steep sides.</p> 
<h4>Casserole</h4> 
<p>A round pot, usually made of ceramic or stainless steel, with a lid. Ranges 
from 2-1/2 to 12 quarts and is useful for baked pasta dishes, such as lasagne 
and other casseroles.</p> 
<h4>Dutch Oven</h4> 
<p>A cross between a braising pan and a casserole, this is generally a round, 
heavy pot, designed for slow cooking. It is often made of enamel-coated cast 
iron or stainless steel and can be used on the stovetop or in the oven. Great 
for soups, stews, and risotto.</p> 
<h4>Pasta Pot</h4> 
<p>This large pot (4 gallon or 16 liter) is specifically designed to boil 
pasta and is also good for making soup. The pot comes with an inner strainer 
insert that allows you to remove the pasta after cooking without having to 
transfer the boiling pot to the sink.</p> 
<h4>Pressure Cooker</h4> 
<p>Usually made from stainless steel, pressure cookers save time and energy. 
The secret to pressure cookers lies in a hermetically sealed cover, which is 
equipped with a steam regulation valve (as well as a second, safety valve) to 
allow for rapid cooking (cooking times will be decreased).</p> 
<h4>Roasting Pan</h4> 
<p>A heavyweight, usually rectangular pan for roasting chicken, turkey, beef, 
pork, lamb, or veal. A good pan will allow even cooking and browning of a 
roast. Choose one with a good-quality V-shaped rack.</p> 
<h4>Saucepan</h4> 
<p>A good saucepan is essential for preparing authentic Italian meals. 
Typically saucepans are fairly deep, straight-sided, or conical pans, which are 
equipped with a long, straight handle to ensure that you are a safe distance 
from the heat source and stay relatively cool while cooking. Saucepans should 
be made of materials that are excellent heat conductors. Copper-lined pans, 
although expensive, are the best because they help ensure foods will not 
scorch. Other good choices include aluminum or stainless steel with a heavy 
bottom made of aluminum or copper. It is best to have a range of at least three 
saucepans in three different sizes. Lids are useful, but often not necessary.
</p> 
<h4>Skillet or Frying Pan</h4> 
<p> A shallow, usually round pan that ranges from 6 to 14 inches in diameter. 
The sides of the pan flare out, which make it easy to turn or toss ingredients 
with a spatula or wooden spoon. The skillet's bottom should be thick so that 
heat spreads evenly and foods cook at the same rate. A skillet is ideal for 
preparing pasta sauces to which cooked pasta is added and tossed. It is also 
good for searing or browning food quickly (such as garlic or onions in hot 
oil). Choose a pan that is not too heavy to lift or move around, with a long 
handle that stays cool.</p> 
<h4>Stockpot</h4> 
<p>A 4- to 6-quart capacity stockpot is ideal for cooking pasta. A colander 
insert for the stockpot to strain the pasta is also useful. A good stockpot 
should have a heavy, thick bottom and secure handles that are solidly attached 
or riveted to the sides of the pot. The best choices for stockpots include 
those made from stainless steel with an aluminum core or with an aluminum disc 
on the bottom or an anodized aluminum pot.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Whisks </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Traditional Bulb Whisk</h4> 
<p>The secret to making the best omelet lies in the beating of the egg. The 
fact that air is a basic ingredient in more than one dish explains the 
importance of the whisk, an often-neglected and often-overlooked utensil. The 
bulb whisk is ideal for light foods, because it incorporates a larger quantity 
of air, while whisks for sauces and dough are characterized by stronger and 
thicker wires.</p> 
<h4>Flat and Spiral Whisks</h4> 
<p>Flat whisks are used to beat small quantities of foods and mix delicate 
ingredients, such as aromatic herbs. The spiral version is ideal for tall, thin 
containers, whereas the flat spiral allows you to prepare the ultimate 
scrambled eggs.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Other Tools </dt> 
<dd> 
<h4>Egg Slicer</h4> 
<p>Slicing an egg with a knife results in different size slices and crumbled 
yolk. The metal strips on the frame of this beloved kitchen utensil ensure 
perfect results every time.</p> 
<h4>Cheese Slicer</h4> 
<p>A cheese slicer is ideal for preparing the cheese that will embellish a hot 
bowl of pasta (e.g., Fontina, Asiago, etc.). The spatula version allows you to 
serve the portion directly onto the dish; the wire version allows you to cut 
the cheese to whatever thickness you want.</p> 
<h4>Lemon Zester</h4> 
<p>Easier than a vegetable knife, a lemon zester skillfully pares zest from 
citrus fruit and leaves the bitter, white pith behind.</p> 
<h4>Mandolin</h4> 
<p>Vegetables are placed between the double blades of this small, 
mandolin-shaped piece of equipment to obtain slices of a desired thickness. 
Nearly every model has a guard to lock the food in place to protect the 
fingers. Easy-to-clean plastic models are preferred, but wood and steel options 
also are available.</p> 
<h4>Pizza Cutter</h4> 
<p>The practical little wheel of the pizza cutter makes it ideal for cutting 
pizza into slices. Better than any knife, it doesn't run the risk of damaging 
work surfaces.</p> 
<h4>Potato Cutter</h4> 
<p>This very practical piece of equipment allows you to julienne potatoes and 
other vegetables perfectly with a single blow of the hand and with minimum 
waste. By pushing down on the handle, the vegetable passes through a cutting 
grill, creating a delicate slice.</p> 
<h4>Vegetable Peeler</h4> 
<p>These utensils have replaced knives for specific and time-consuming food 
preparation, such as peeling, slicing, or zesting.</p> </dd> </dl> <br>

<h3>Glossary of Italian Foods</h3> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V 
W X Y Z <br>

<h4>Amatriciana (Amatriciana)</h4> 
<p>A classic Italian pasta sauce, made with saut&eacute;ed cured meat such as 
pancetta or smoky-flavored bacon. Its origins trace to Amatrice, Italy, near 
Rome, where in ancient times the shepherds would make this savory sauce by 
saut&eacute;ing diced, dried pork jowls.</p> 
<h4>Anchovy Filets (Acciuga)</h4> 
<p>Small silvery fish; true anchovies come only from the Mediterranean and 
southern European country coastlines. Sold in cans, flat or rolled as fillets, 
salt-cured and in oil. Cans may be stored at room temperature for one year; 
opened, they will last in the refrigerator for two months if sealed airtight 
and covered with oil. Soak in cool water for 30 minutes to remove saltiness.</p>
<h4>Artichoke Hearts (Cuore di Carciofo)</h4> 
<p>The large, edible flower bud of the artichoke plant was first grown in 
Sicily. There are approximately 90 different varieties of artichokes grown in 
Italy; some are found only regionally and others are found nationwide. In the 
United States, artichokes are grown almost exclusively in California. The 
artichoke heart is the tightly packed leaves that form the base of the bud. Its 
outer leaves are pale green colored, while the inner leaves are a grey-green 
color. This tasty, Mediterranean plant may be boiled, steamed, microwaved, or 
saut&eacute;ed. Avoid buying artichokes with heavy brown discoloration on the 
leaves; this indicates that the artichoke is past its prime. Store artichokes 
unwashed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to four days. It is best 
to use artichokes the day they are purchased since they can dehydrate quickly.
</p> 
<h4>Arugula (Rucola)</h4> 
<p>Slightly bitter, aromatic salad green, arugula has a peppery mustard taste 
and contains a rich source of vitamins A and C. It is sold fresh in bunches; 
purchase ones that have bright green leaves. Wash thoroughly before using. 
Arugula will keep refrigerated for only two days wrapped tightly in plastic.</p>
<h4>Asiago Cheese (Formaggio Asiago)</h4> 
<p>A whole, semi-cooked cow's milk cheese typical of Veneto and Trentino in 
Northern Italy. It is yellow in color, has a glossy rind and a mild nutty 
flavor, which intensifies with aging. Suitable for grating when aged over one 
year. Asiago cheese is certified by the Italian Consortium designated to 
protect the quality and origin of Asiago cheese.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Balsamic Vinegar (Aceto Balsamico)</h4> 
<p>An aromatic, pleasantly sweet yet tart, dark, thick vinegar made from 
select grapes aged in wooden barrels. Traditional balsamic vinegar is aged for 
a period of 12 to 25 years, although younger varieties do exist. The oldest 
balsamic vinegar is reserved for drizzling over fresh fruit or sipping on 
special occasions. Since the Middle Ages, Modena, Italy has been known for its 
outstanding balsamic vinegars. Due to the high acidity of vinegar, it is 
self-preserving and does not need to be refrigerated. Balsamic vinegar is best 
stored airtight in a cool, dark place at room temperature. Available online at
www.academiabarilla.com.</p> 
<h4>Basil (Basilico)</h4> 
<p>Basil is an aromatic herb that is key in Mediterranean cooking. Fresh basil

quality of extra virgin olive oil is controlled by specific standards of 
classifications defined by the Consortium of Oil. In order to carry the 
distinguished designation provided by the Consortium, each producer of oil must 
pass a certification standard that controls the oil's origin. Extra virgin 
olive oil should be stored in a cool place away from heat and light. Its shelf 
life is dependent on how it has been stored, ranging from 12 to 24 months.

<p>A fortified wine (to which brandy has been added); available in a variety 
of colors, flavors, and sweetness. Quality ranges from connoisseur quality to 
inexpensive mass-produced products. All sherries are fully aged when purchased 
and do not benefit from further aging. It is recommended to consume sherry soon 
after purchase. Once opened, it may be recorked and stored in a cool, dark 
place, free from humidity and variations in temperature.</p> 
<h4>Squash, Yellow (Zucca)</h4> 
<p>The fruit of a gourd family plant. Yellow squash is a summer squash that is 
thin skinned, has edible seeds, and requires a short cooking time. Prepared as 
a vegetable that may be saut&eacute;ed, fried, grilled, or baked. Select squash 
that is firm, fairly heavy for its size, and has a bright, glossy outer rind. 
Avoid squash that has cracks, bruises, or soft spots.</p> 
<h4>Swordfish (Pesce Spada)</h4> 
<p> A saltwater, slightly oily, flavorful fish. Its light, almost 
opaque-colored meat is sold as steaks or fillets and is available fresh or 
frozen. Swordfish has a firm texture and a rich, sweet flavor. Refrigerate as 
soon as possible after purchase and use within 24 hours. Suitable for 
pan-frying, grilling, baking, or poaching.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Tarragon (Dragoncello)</h4> 
<p>An aromatic herb that has an anise-like flavor that is very distinctive. 
Available fresh during summer months and the early fall; available dried year 
round.</p> 
<h4>Tomatoes, Cherry (Pomodorini)</h4> 
<p>Small, one inch in diameter, red to yellow tomatoes. Mildly acidic, served 
raw or prepared in sauces. Purchase locally grown tomatoes whenever possible. 
Fragrance is a better indicator of a good tomato than its color. Select 
brightly colored, plump, heavy tomatoes that do not show signs of shriveled 
skins. Avoid those with blemishes, bruises, or cracks. Never refrigerate fresh 
tomatoes; cold temperatures cause tomatoes to lose their flavor and to become 
pulpy. Store fresh tomatoes at room temperature. Allow unripe tomatoes to ripen 
in a cool, dark place, preferably in a brown paper bag, away from direct 
sunlight.</p> 
<h4>Tomatoes, Grape (Pomodori Pachino)</h4> 
<p>Smaller than cherry tomatoes, about half the size. Flavorful, easy to fork, 
and frequently found in salads. Purchase locally grown tomatoes whenever 
possible. Fragrance is a better indicator of a good tomato than its color. 
Select brightly colored, plump, heavy tomatoes that do not show signs of 
shriveled skins. Avoid those with blemishes, bruises, or cracks. Never 
refrigerate fresh tomatoes; cold temperatures cause tomatoes to lose their 
flavor and to become pulpy. Store fresh tomatoes at room temperature. Allow 
unripe tomatoes to ripen in a cool, dark place, preferably in a brown paper 
bag, away from direct sunlight.</p> 
<h4>Tomatoes, Yellow Pear (Pomodoro Giallo)</h4> 
<p>Smaller than cherry tomatoes, yellow in color, and resembles a tiny pear in 
shape. Purchase locally grown tomatoes whenever possible. Fragrance is a better 
indicator of a good tomato than its color. Select brightly colored, plump, 
heavy tomatoes that do not show signs of shriveled skins. Avoid those with 
blemishes, bruises, or cracks. Never refrigerate fresh tomatoes; cold 
temperatures cause tomatoes to lose their flavor and to become pulpy. Store 
fresh tomatoes at room temperature. Allow unripe tomatoes to ripen in a cool, 
dark place, preferably in a brown paper bag, away from direct sunlight.</p> 
<h4>Tomatoes, Plum (Pomodori San Marzano)</h4> 
<p>Oblong-shaped tomatoes available year round; also called Roma tomatoes. 
Excellent for sauces and used raw in salads. Purchase locally grown tomatoes 
whenever possible. Fragrance is a better indicator of a good tomato than its 
color. Select brightly colored, plump, heavy tomatoes that do not show signs of 
shriveled skins. Avoid those with blemishes, bruises, or cracks. Never 
refrigerate fresh tomatoes; cold temperatures cause tomatoes to lose their 
flavor and to become pulpy. Store fresh tomatoes at room temperature. Allow 
unripe tomatoes to ripen in a cool, dark place, preferably in a brown paper 
bag, away from direct sunlight.</p> 
<h4>Truffles, Black (Tartufo Nero)</h4> 
<p>Prized mushrooms highly regarded as a delicacy. Truffles grow 3 to 12 
inches beneath the ground near the roots of trees. Also known as black 
diamonds, truffles are ferreted out by specially trained pigs and dogs. Of the 
more than 70 varieties, the black truffle is the most popular and is imported 
from France or the Umbria region of Italy to the United States.</p>

<h3>Glossary of Cooking Terms</h3> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V 
W X Y Z <br>

<h4>Al dente</h4> 
<p>Italian phrase that describes pasta when it is cooked slightly resistant to 
the tooth: firm yet cooked thoroughly; translated, it means to the tooth.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Beat</h4> 
<p>To stir rapidly in a circular motion, either by hand or with an electric 
mixer, to introduce air into the mixture to achieve a lighter, fluffy texture.
</p> 
<h4>Blanch</h4> 
<p>To blanch vegetables or fruits, briefly submerge them in boiling water, 
then plunge them immediately and briefly into ice-cold water to stop the 
cooking process. Blanching heightens the color and flavor of foods and is often 
used before freezing food items. Also called parboil.</p> 
<h4>Blend</h4> 
<p>Combining two or more ingredients together to obtain a smooth mixture, 
using a spoon or electric mixer. To avoid lumps, stir the mixture in one 
direction only. One particular type of blending is folding in, or adding other 
ingredients to an already whipped mixture and mixing delicately so as not to 
remove the air contained in the mixture. This operation is more successful if 
the two ingredients are of the same temperature.</p> 
<h4>Broil</h4> 
<p>Cooking technique that places food directly above or below the heat source; 
for example, on a charcoal grill or under a gas or electric heating element.</p>
<h4>Brown</h4> 
<p>Cooking method that uses high heat to cause the food's outside surface to 
turn brown while the inside surface remains moist; adds rich flavor and 
appetizing color to foods.</p> 
<h4>Brush</h4> 
<p> Using a tool, such as a pastry brush, to apply liquid (marinade or oil) to 
the surface of food.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Chop</h4> 
<p>To coarsely cut food into smaller pieces of roughly the same size using 
quick, heavy blows of a knife or other sharp tool, such as a food processor.</p>
<h4>Combine</h4> 
<p>To mix ingredients together.</p> 
<h4>Crisp-tender</h4> 
<p>An ideal degree of doneness, usually refers to vegetables that are tender 
yet retain their texture.</p> 
<h4>Crumble</h4> 
<p>To break food into smaller pieces by hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Deglaze</h4> 
<p>Cooking technique that removes excess fat from the cooking pan. Deglazing 
is done by adding a small amount of liquid, such as wine or stock, and scraping 
up the pieces of browned food in the pan. This process creates the base for 
sauce mixtures, which are served with the food that was cooked in the pan.</p> 
<h4>Dice</h4> 
<p>To cut food into small cubes.</p> 
<h4>Drizzle</h4> 
<p>To sprinkle or pour a fine stream of liquid over food.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Emulsify</h4> 
<p>To combine two liquids of different densities by whipping them together 
with a whisk or a blender; vinaigrette, mayonnaise, and cream are three of the 
most common examples of emulsions. The emulsion obtained from the mixture of a 
watery substance and an oily one, such as vinaigrette, is unstable; the two 
liquids will separate when you stop mixing. To make it stable, an emulsifier 
(such as mustard) is needed to bind them together. The most commonly used 
emulsifier in cooking is egg yolk, but pectin, soya lecithin, and gelatin also 
have similar properties.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Garnish</h4> 
<p>To add decorative touches to dishes being served.</p> 
<h4>Grate</h4> 
<p>To make firm foods (e.g., hard cheese) into small particles by rubbing them 
against a serrated tool, such as a grater.</p> 
<h4>Gratinate</h4> 
<p>The finishing of an already cooked dish by putting it into the oven to form 
a crispy golden crust on the surface. There are two methods of gratinating: 
full, which involves cooking and gratinating raw food at the same time, and a 
quicker method, during which the crust is simply added to precooked food. In 
the first case, the whole cooking process is done in the oven, with the food 
covered with enough liquid to allow it to cook without burning; the second 
method, normally used for pasta, involves sprinkling grated cheese and 
breadcrumbs on the top, adding oil or butter, and placing in the oven.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Marinate</h4> 
<p>To allow food, such as meat, poultry, fish, or vegetables, to stand for a 
period of time in a liquid mixture. This mixture usually contains an acidic 
ingredient, such as wine or lemon juice, and is often seasoned with herbs. 
Marinating causes food to absorb the flavors of the liquid mixture; can be used 
to tenderize meats.</p> 
<h4>Mash</h4> 
<p>To smash or crush food, such as potatoes, into a smooth mixture.</p> 
<h4>Mince</h4> 
<p>To cut food into small, fine pieces.</p> 
<h4>Mix</h4> 
<p>To combine two or more foods into a uniform mixture using a stirring motion.
</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Puree</h4> 
<p>To blend or process food into a smooth, thick, paste-like consistency.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Reduce</h4> 
<p>To rapidly boil a liquid, such as sauce, stock, or wine, until its volume 
is reduced. This process, often referred to as a reduction, intensifies the 
flavor and thickens the consistency.</p> 
<h4>Refresh</h4> 
<p>To immerse a hot vegetable in ice water to set the color and flavor.</p> 
<h4>Reserve</h4> 
<p>To set aside an ingredient for use at a later time.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Saut&eacute;</h4> 
<p>To cook quickly in a very hot pan using a small amount of fat or oil. This 
technique requires that food be turned over frequently to allow it to cook 
evenly. (In meat recipes, the term &quot;saut&eacute;&quot; means to cook by 
browning.) A professional chef will saut&eacute; using a characteristic wrist 
and hand movement to &quot;throw&quot; the ingredients up into the air and have 
them land back in the pan on the other side. Home cooks can simply turn the 
pasta and vegetables frequently with a wooden spoon, so that all the food gets 
flavored by the oil, butter, or sauce in the pan, and all surfaces are covered 
by a golden crust.</p> 
<h4>Shave</h4> 
<p>To slice, especially cold cuts of meat, very finely or thinly.</p> 
<h4>Simmer</h4> 
<p>To cook food in liquid, keeping it just below boiling. Simmering is 
different from boiling since the heated liquid reaches the surface in tiny 
bubbles.</p> 
<h4>Soffritto</h4> 
<p>An Italian term for a lightly saut&eacute;ed mixture of vegetables that is 
the starting point for a sauce or soup (and many other dishes, such as 
casseroles). The process involves saut&eacute;ing a mixture of chopped 
vegetables and herbs in oil or butter at a fairly low temperature. Most often, 
the essential ingredients for a soffritto are garlic or onion; both have a more 
delicate flavor and are more easily digested if cooked over a low heat for a 
short time. Many recipes suggest that this cooking should continue only to the 
point when the onion becomes transparent, or &quot;slightly golden&quot; at the 
most; similarly, if garlic is left on the heat for too long it darkens and 
becomes bitter. Those who prefer a lighter flavor may wish to replace the onion 
or garlic with shallots.</p> 
<h4>Steam</h4> 
<p>A cooking process that softens food placed in a covered pan or container on 
a rack or basket. Boiling or simmering water passes over the food to cook it 
(as opposed to submerging the food into water to cook it). This method retains 
the nutrients, flavors, taste, and texture of foods.</p> 
<h4>Steep</h4> 
<p>To extract or infuse the flavor of a dry ingredient, such as tea or coffee, 
by soaking in a hot liquid.</p> 
<h4>Strain</h4> 
<p>To pass through a filter, such as a strainer, to separate solids from 
liquids.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Toast</h4> 
<p>To lightly brown the surface of food with dry heat.</p> 
<h4>Toss</h4> 
<p>To combine ingredients quickly yet gently using two utensils and a lifting 
motion.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to Top</strong></p> 
<h4>Whisk</h4> 
<p>To beat ingredients together using a wire tool called a whisk.</p> 
<h4>Whip</h4> 
<p>To stir air into a mixture or ingredient using a whisk in order to make the 
mixture swell and thicken. The classic example of this procedure is in the 
preparation of sweets, when whipping egg white or cream. The term, however, is 
also used in cooking to describe operations that bind and lighten a sauce with 
fats (oil, butter, or cream) or egg yolk; this procedure involves whipping the 
sauce energetically, just before serving, as the sauce obtained using this 
procedure is not very stable.</p> 
<h4>Wilt</h4> 
<p>To cook, saut&eacute;, or steam a vegetable until it becomes limp.</p>
