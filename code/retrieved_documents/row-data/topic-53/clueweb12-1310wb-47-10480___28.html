<h3><b>...Global Knives...are razor sharp ... On Sale Now!</b> </h3> 
<h3><b>These cutting edge modern knives are all handmade in Japan!</b> </h3> 
<p><b>Global knives are manufactured by Yoshikin in Niigata, Japan. They were 
designed in 1985 by Komin Yamada. When Komin Yamada was commissioned for the 
job his mandate was to develop a range of knives that was truly new and 
revolutionary, using the best materials available and the latest manufacturing 
techniques. FEATURES; The two most innovative features of Global knives are 
their edge and the way they are balanced. The most important feature of any 
knife is its edge, and the Global edge is truly its signature. The majority of 
the Global knives are sharpened or ground on both sides of the blade like 
western style knives. However, their edges are ground straight to a point 
rather than beveled resulting in a dramatically sharper knife which stays 
sharper longer. The edge is so large and prominent that it is easily seen with 
the naked eye and extends a quarter inch or more up from the tip of the knife. 
To balance their knives, Global uses a hollow handle which is then filled with 
just the right amount of sand to create the correct balance. Global uses this 
method rather than using a full tang and a bolster to balance their knives for 
two reasons. First, it is a far more precise than using a tang and a bolster. 
Second, Asian knives typically do not have bolsters, since they only serve as a 
hindrance to cutting and sharpening. Other unique features of Global knives are 
their smooth contours and seamless, all stainless steel construction which 
eliminates food and dirt traps offering the ultimate in safety and hygiene. 
Global knives are made from the finest high carbon stainless steel available 
for producing professional quality kitchen knives. Yoshikin uses its own 
proprietary stainless steel which it calls CROMOVA 18 Stainless Steel. This 
steel is hard enough for Global knives to keep their edge for a long time, but 
soft enough so that it is not too difficult to sharpen the knives. The CRO in 
CROMOVA 18 stands for chromium and the 18 is the percentage of chromium in the 
steel. This high percentage of chromium contributes to Global's good stain 
resistance. Care should be taken to keep your Global knives stain and rust 
free. The MO and VA in CROMOVA 18 stand for molybdenum and vanadium. These two 
elements give a knife good edge retention. It is often asked why Global knives 
stay sharp so long without sharpening. The combination of the elements 
molybdenum and vanadium is one reason, even as the Global straight edge gets 
dull it is still much thinner, and, therefore, much sharper than the knife with 
the beveled edge.<br>

Global knives 
are made from the finest high carbon stainless steel available for producing 
professional quality kitchen knives. Yoshikin uses its own proprietary 
stainless steel which it calls CROMOVA 18 Stainless Steel. This steel is hard 
enough for Global knives to keep their edge for a long time, but soft enough so 
that it is not too difficult to sharpen the knives. The CRO in CROMOVA 18 
stands for chromium and the 18 is the percentage of chromium in the steel. This 
high percentage of chromium contributes to Global's good stain resistance. The 
MO and VA in CROMOVA 18 stand for molybdenum and vanadium. These two elements 
give a knife good edge retention. See FREE OFFERS above &amp; below!</b></b></b>
