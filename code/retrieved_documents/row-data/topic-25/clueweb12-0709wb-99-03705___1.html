<p>View Full Version : Internet Explorer 7.0 and CSS2</p> <br>

<br>
 As many of you know, Microsoft 
has announced that it will be releasing Internet Explorer 7.0 this summer to 
those who are on the XP operating system in a project code named 
&#147;Rincon&#148;. The move is reportedly being done to improve the security 
of the IE browser. However, with browsers such as Firefox gaining market share, 
many people speculate that the new Internet Explorer will come with more than 
just security enhancements. Features such as tabbed browsing, built in 
anti-spyware, and RSS aggregating are all features that appear to be coming 
with the Rincon project.<br>
<br>
 The real question, however, for any website 
owner and developer is whether Microsoft will create a browser that interprets 
CSS2 in a standard way. Currently Microsoft does not support all of CSS2&#146;s 
functionalities and also adds some functionalities that CSS2 never initially 
supported. The result is nothing more than a major headache for those 
developing a website that is accessible to all people, regardless of the 
browser they are using.<br>
<br>
 So will Microsoft finally adhere to the 
official CSS2 specifications? Don&#146;t bet on it. A look at Microsoft&#146;s 
history and their current position in the market place seems to point to the 
idea that they will continue to buck the open source development trend and try 
to mold the marketplace according to their vision.<br>
<br>
 Microsoft Views 
Incompatibility as a Competitive Advantage<br>
<br>
 Most website developers 
develop a website for Internet Explorer first, and for the secondary browsers 
second. The reason for this is obvious. If you have a website that works in 
Firefox, but appears broken in Internet Explorer, the site appears broken to 
over 90% of its visitors. On the flip side, if the site works fine in Internet 
Explorer, but not in Firefox, only a small percentage of your website visitors 
are inconvenienced.<br>
<br>
 Microsoft, being the vast market share holder in 
the browser market, can influence the behavior of website owners and web 
surfers. Because not every site is optimized for browsers such as Firefox, web 
surfers who try to make the transition to Firefox will find themselves on 
familiar sites that appear broken to them in Firefox, but not Internet Explorer 
because Internet Explorer does not follow a standard set of rules that any 
browser can comply with. The result is that these surfers who try to make the 
transition over to Firefox will go back to the more familiar Internet Explorer.
<br> <br>
 Keep the Advantage, Eliminate the Disadvantages <br>
<br>
 There are 
a few reasons for people making the switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox. 
There is the obvious group of people that truly believe Microsoft is evil, so 
they will do anything to avoid a Microsoft product no matter how much it 
inconveniences them. Microsoft is not worried about these people so much 
because they will always represent a small group of people. What Microsoft does 
need to worry about is the real advantages of making the switch to Firefox.<br>

<br> Security <br>
 Security is probably the top reason people make the switch 
to Firefox. Now that most people have been introduced to spyware, awareness of 
PC security is becoming a bigger issue. Any person who does a little research 
will quickly realize that most spyware programs focus on the vulnerabilities of 
Internet Explorer, since that is what most surfers use. Making the switch to 
Firefox not only gives surfers new security features that are not available 
with Internet Explorer, but they also remove themselves from the target of 
spyware creators.<br>
<br>
 Since security is the one of the biggest reasons 
people leave Internet Explorer, the people at Microsoft have decided to make 
security a major priority. And, in the interest of giving credit where credit 
is due, they should be commended for finally looking to improve the security of 
their browser. Who knows how many countless computers were infected with 
spyware programs due to the vulnerabilities Internet Explorer presented.<br>

<br> Features <br>
 Firefox also offers unique features that users cannot get 
with Internet Explorer. Features such as tabbed browsing, RSS Aggregation, and 
others have proven to be more than just nice ideas or some programmer&#146;s 
pet hobby. Unfortunately for Firefox, they have proved to be the market testing 
for Microsoft, without Microsoft having to spend any money on development. Look 
for Microsoft to continue to copy the successful features of Firefox in the 
future, and ignore those features that are not successful.<br>
<br>
 Back to 
CSS2<br>
<br>
 What is CSS2 really? CSS2 is nothing more than a set of 
recommendations for controlling layout and design of websites put forth by the 
World Wide Web Consortium. The W3C&#146;s goal for their recommendations is to 
avoid market fragmentation on the Internet, thus creating a more uniform and 
more enjoyable surfing experience for web users. Ironically enough, Microsoft 
and the W3C have the same goal, although Microsoft would like to have 
uniformity on the web as a result of everyone using Internet Explorer.<br>
<br>

 As long as Microsoft is able to hold onto its market share through segmenting 
the market, they will do so. They will have this ability as long as they have 
an overwhelming majority of the market share. Unfortunately for those who make 
their living designing and developing websites, there are only two hopeful 
outcomes to make life easier: either Microsoft loses enough market share that 
they decide to adopt the W3C&#146;s recommendations, or Microsoft successfully 
eliminates all browser competitors and is the only option for web surfers. 
Until one of these two options occurs, expect Microsoft to continue to 
interpret the web as they see fit, and in a way that will keep users on 
Microsoft products.<br>

<br> Unfortunately, my eyes tend to glaze over and I tune out when I hit a 
paraqgraph like this - just one more piece of Microsoft conspiracy theory 
rhetoric.<br>
<br>
 Additionally, the other side of this coin is at Details on 
our CSS changes for IE7 
(http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/22/712830.aspx):<br>
<br>
<br>
 We 
are currently locking down IE7 for shipping and I wanted to give an update on 
the CSS work that went into IE7. Chris originally outlined our plans for IE7, 
and we listened to a lot of feedback (blog, connect database, conferences, our 
WASP partnership etc.) to help us address the most grievous bugs and prioritize 
which features to put in for IE7. I like to thank especially the contributors 
on this blog for their participation. Your feedback made a difference in 
deciding what issues to address.<br>
<br>
 We understand that we are far from 
being done and we know we have still a lot of work ahead of us. IE 7 is a 
stepping stone in our effort to improve our standards compliance (especially 
around CSS). As an example, in the platform we did not focus on any proprietary 
properties &ndash; though we may try out new features in the future using the 
official &ndash;ms- prefix, following the CSS extension mechanism. We also work 
very closely with the W3C CSS working group (which I am a member of) to help 
clarify assumptions in our implementation and drive clarifications into the 
spec. I really like to thank everyone who helped us here.<br>
<br>
 In all, we 
made over 200 behavior changes (bug fixes or new features) under strict mode to 
improve CSS2.1 compliance. All this work (with the exception of transparent 
PNGs) has been done under the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; switch only, since all changes 
required behavioral updates to be more in line what the CSS spec specifies. To 
preserve application compatibility we will not make any behavioral changes to 
&ldquo;quirks mode&rdquo; as it has been established since IE6.<br>
<br>
 Here 
is the list of CSS features and changes for IE7:<br>
<br>

etc)<br>
 Fixed the opposing offset problem (absolute positioned element whit 
all four top, bottom left and right are present)<br>
 &lt;a&gt; tags nested 
within LI elements will no longer add extra bottom margin when hover occurs<br>

 We no longer lose the image aspect ratio on refresh<br>
 Cleaned up our ident 
parsing according to CSS2.1 rules<br>
 Fixed parsing bugs for multi- class 
selectors and class selectors that are combined with id selectors<br>

Transparent borders<br>
 Fixed positioning support <br>
 Selectors: 
first-child, adjacent, attribute, child<br>
 A couple of CSS 3 attribute 
selectors: prefix, suffix and substring since we were working already in the 
code base (also the general sibling selector)<br>
 Alpha channel PNG support 
(Not a CSS feature but too important for designers to not call it out J)<br>
 
Better Standards Support&hellip;<br>
 But as we&rsquo;ve been continually 
reminded, better standards support in IE also means some pages break. As we 
struggle to balance the needs of our user customers with the desires of web 
developers, we need your help. The only way for us to continue to improve our 
standards support is to get your help in changing your sites for IE7. We have 
provided a set of documentation and tools to help you transition your pages to 
IE7:<br>
<br>
 The IE 7 Readiness Toolkit pulls together documentation, tools, 
and guidance for developers, testers, and ITPros to prepare sites, extensions 
and applications for IE 7.<br>
 The Cascading Style Sheet Compatibility in 
Internet Explorer 7 - documentation on common breaking patterns and techniques 
you can do to avoid them.<br>
 Developer and ITPro Checklists <br>
 The IE 
Developer Center is the clearinghouse for all (past and present) IE developer 
information.<br>
 We have an Application Compatibility Toolkit that logs and 
identifies changes in behavior due to changes in IE 7 and Vista.<br>
 All of 
this is wrapped up for you in the Information Index for IE 7.<br>
 Finally, as 
we&rsquo;ve talked about before, we have a Web Developer Toolbar, which is a 
great aid during the development and debugging of a website.<br>
<br>
 We are 
already planning for the next IE release and will continue down the road of 
improving our CSS support.<br>
