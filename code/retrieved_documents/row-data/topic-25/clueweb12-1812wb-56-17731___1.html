<h1>Mozilla Firefox vs Google Chrome vs Internet Explorer &ndash; Who Has The 
Best Commercial?</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>This will be a blog post series about internet browsers that 
will cover everything you need</strong> (and don&rsquo;t need) <strong>to know 
about most popular internet browsers.</strong> Amongst other things that will 
be covered are<strong>reviews, comparing browsers, tips and tricks, 
recommendations and more stuff.</strong> So let&rsquo;s start with 
today&rsquo;s first post in this series.</p> 
<p>I think we all know how much <strong>good advertising</strong> can help to 
make more people use the product that is promoted. Although, it&rsquo;s not 
only good advertising that is enough for best quality of internet browser, I 
wanted to make a little<strong>comparision between the Mozilla Firefox, Google 
Chrome and Internet Explorer video commercials</strong>. First of all I must 
say they are all great. I couldn&rsquo;t decide which is the best so I posted 
all of them here. That way, you can see for yourself and share what you think 
about these commercials with others. But hey, don&rsquo;t think that if one of 
these has the best commercial, that they also have the best or fastest internet 
browser.<strong>I will write another post i this series that will cover all 
cons and pros of these internet browsers</strong> (and I will include 
Apple&rsquo;s<strong>Safari and Opera</strong> too).<br>
<br>
 But now 
let&rsquo;s see which of the internet browsers has the best commercial (I did 
not add<strong>Opera and Safari commercials</strong> because I could not find 
their commercials but if you find one, please add it to comments so I can 
update post and add it here on the list).</p> 
<h3>Microsoft Internet Explorer Commercial</h3> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Mozilla Firefox Commercial</h3> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Google Chrome Commercial</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any major issues or differences in the rendering of 
web pages<br>
 Yes being a developer my first reaction was like Oh no not 
another browser and thats where I read somewhere in chrome&rsquo;s website that 
if your website runs on safari 3.1, it will work fine on chrome<br>
 big relief 
:)<br>
 This is nice place you got here Brandon, I like your designs :)</p>

<p>Maybe in the Future there is more Faster Changes on Browsers Well for me I 
Think IE is still good for me. Because it comes with Microsoft.</p> 
<p>But Mozilla has Tools that can Bypass something like Surveys, and it can 
Speed up by Hacking on the Settings</p> 
<p>By the Way is DAP/Download Accelerator Plus a Internet Browser or Not.</p>

<p>Firefox plugins are good compared to any other browser.<br>
 But chrome is 
fast that all other browsers.<br>
 but people stick to that which they feel 
better .<br>
 It depends upon their use and nature of work</p> Reply <br>
