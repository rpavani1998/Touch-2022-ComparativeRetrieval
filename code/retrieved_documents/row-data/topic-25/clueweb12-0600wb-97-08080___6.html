<h1>Browser Wars: Chrome vs. IE9 vs. Firefox</h1>  You're spoiled for choice 
these days when it comes to choosing a Web browser&#151;all of the big names 
are viable choices, and, if you don't like the big three there's always Safari 
and Opera, too. Which one is right for you?

<p><em>Editor's Note: A newer version of this story is available at this link:
Browser Wars: Chrome vs. IE9 vs. Firefox</em></p> 
<p>Web browsers are converging. Since the arrival of Google Chrome nearly 
three years ago, all browsers have come under its influence, and they've all 
moved in the same three-pronged directions&mdash;speedier page loading, cleaner 
user interfaces, and greater support for new Web standards. All of the major 
browsers&mdash;Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera&mdash;have 
made significant strides in each of these three dimensions. The first two 
qualities are pretty much universally desirable, but the &quot;standards&quot; 
support piece, while also desirable, gets sticky: Each browser seems to support 
a different subset of the many features that fall under the label HTML5. All 
you have to do is check out each browser's HTML5 demo site. Apple's HTML5 
demos, for example, flat out won't function unless you're browsing with Safari. 
So much for &quot;standards.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Speed of the Web</strong><br>
 Along with new standard support, 
all browsers have posted massive improvements in page-rendering and script 
execution speed. You just have to look at the often-cited SunSpider JavaScript 
benchmarks to see this. Even Chrome, which I already described as 
&quot;lightning fast&quot; in December of 2008, has sped up on the test from a 
time of 881ms to 267ms in version 12 on my 2.6GHz dual-core laptop&mdash;that's 
less than a third of the time! The rest of the browsers have followed suit, 
clustering around the same level of performance. Mozilla and Google have built 
their own Javascript speed tests, Kraken and V8, respectively. When these first 
came out, the maker's own browsers widely outpaced competitors, but results on 
these tests are also evening out.</p> 
<p> </p> <strong>Browser</strong> <strong>Google V8 (v.6) Score <br>
(higher 
is better)</strong> <br>
Google Chrome 12 8205 <br>
Firefox 5 3459 <br>
Opera 
11.50 3454 <br>
<br>
Safari 5.1 2567 <br>
Internet Explorer 9 2360 <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> <strong>Browser</strong> <strong>Mozilla Kraken 1.1 Score in ms <br>

(lower is better)</strong> <br>
Google Chrome 12 4841 <br>
Firefox 5 5707 <br>

Opera 11.50 12353 <br>
Internet Explorer 9 15050 <br>
Safari 5 17603 <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> <strong>Browser</strong> <strong>SunSpider 0.9.1 Score in ms<br>
 
(lower is better)</strong> <br>
Internet Explorer 9 245 <br>
Google Chrome 12 
267 <br>
Firefox 5 282 <br>
Opera 11.50 279 <br>
Safari 5.1 303 <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The next frontier in browser performance is about graphics hardware 
acceleration. In this area, Internet Explorer and Firefox are ahead of Google 
Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Microsoft was the first browser maker to make an 
issue of hardware acceleration in the buildup to its releasing IE9. The 
company's site for its browser, calledIETestdrive.com, sports a slew of 
demonstrations that show off hardware acceleration, which you can try running 
in any browser. On these, you can clearly see IE and Firefox's lead in hardware 
acceleration.</p> 
<p>On the FishIE demo, which uses Canvas and Javascript to display swimming 
tropical fish, Chrome delivered 40 frames per second with 20 fish and 5 FPS 
with 500 fish. Since both Firefox 4 and IE9 use hardware acceleration for more 
than just future 3D content, they score the maximum 60 FPS with 20 fish, but IE 
still beats Firefox with 500 fish. Chrome was, however, better than Opera, 
which only mustered 20FPS and 3FPS.</p> <strong>Browser</strong> <strong>FishIE 
with 20 fish (FPS - higher is better)</strong> <strong>500 Fish</strong> <br>

Internet Explorer 9 60 39 <br>
Firefox 4 60 35 <br>
Google Chrome 12 40 4 <br>

Opera 11.50 20 3 <br>
Safari 5 20 3 <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another IE9 demo, Psychedelic Browsing, spins a color wheel and plays spacy 
sounds, reporting RPM as a result. Surprisingly, Firefox beats Microsoft at its 
own game here by a tad, though it doesn't play the required sound. Chrome, 
however, plays the test's required sound, but fares far worse in the 
revolutions per minute result:</p> 
<p> </p> <strong>Browser</strong> <strong>Psychedelic Browsing<br>
RPM (higher 
is better)</strong> <br>
Firefox 4 1885 (no sound) <br>
Internet Explorer 9 
1799 (correct sound) <br>
Google Chrome 12 131 (correct sound) <br>
Opera 11 82 
(no sound) <br>
Safari 5 83 (no sound) <br>
<br>

<p>One final test of hardware acceleration comes from Mozilla, its Hardware 
Acceleration Stress test, which spins a spiral of photos in the browser window 
and reports a score in frames per second (which tops out at the LCD's maximum 
of 60FPS):</p> 
<p> </p> <strong>Browser</strong> <strong>Mozilla Hardware Acceleration Stress 
Test<br>
FPS (higher is better)</strong> <br>
Firefox 4 60 <br>
Internet 
Explorer 9 60 <br>
Google Chrome 12 17 <br>
Opera 11 17 <br>
Safari 5 3 <br>

<br> 
<p>On this test, again, the browsers with graphics hardware acceleration 
trounced those without. IE8 can't run the test since it lacks the requisite 
HTML5 support.</p>
