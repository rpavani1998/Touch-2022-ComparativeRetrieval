<h2>A fictional story about a guy who did everything wrong one&nbsp;day</h2> 
October 7, 2010 <br>

<p>Hi there.</p> 
<p>My name is Johnny, and I had a busy day today.</p> 
<p>I woke up around eight because I had a new job as a secret shopper. I got 
an email a couple weeks ago, and they hired me on the spot when I responded. 
Yesterday, an envelope arrived with a check and my first assignment.</p> 
<p>I headed to my bank around nine. At first, the teller didn&rsquo;t want to 
cash the check because I only had six bucks in my account, but I whined and got 
in her face and demanded to talk to the manager until she relented. 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cashier&rsquo;s check,&rdquo; I told her in no uncertain 
terms. &ldquo;Those are the same as cash.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I left the bank with $2,700 in my pocket and headed to the nearest Western 
Union location. The guy there kept asking me questions about the money I was 
wiring, so I finally told him it was for a relative in Canada, just like the 
secret shopping company told me to do. It was a little annoying the way he 
wouldn&rsquo;t leave me alone. I&rsquo;m going to put that in my report for 
sure.</p> 
<p>By the time I was done, it was only ten o&rsquo;clock. I had made $150 for 
less than an hour of work! I could get used to this lifestyle. I decided to 
head home.</p> 
<p>The phone was ringing when I came in the door. I ran to answer, and this 
guy from the county courthouse was telling me I was going to be arrested for 
not appearing for jury duty.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But I never got a letter that said anything about jury duty,&rdquo; 
I said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The fact is 
that you didn&rsquo;t show, and an officer will be stopping by later today to 
make the arrest.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip;isn&rsquo;t there some way I could just do jury duty 
another time? I didn&rsquo;t miss on purpose.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Let me see what I can do, sir,&rdquo; the man said. After a minute 
on hold, he told me I could just pay a fine and the whole thing would be taken 
care of. I gave him my name, date of birth, Social Security number and some 
credit card information to pay the fine. I was relieved when I hung up the 
phone. Crisis averted.</p> 
<p>The mail had arrived, but it was nothing but a pile of credit card offers. 
I threw these in the trash unopened. Nobody&rsquo;s going to rip me off.</p> 
<p>I sat down on the sofa to unwind with some TV. It was mostly talk shows at 
that time of morning, but there was a news broadcast between commercials that 
caught my eye. It gave some phone number you could call to get your debts 
eliminated. I have a lot of debt, so I wrote down the number. It seemed like a 
strange place for a news alert, during the commercials, but whatever. There was 
a ticker on the screen&nbsp;and some footage of the President, so it must 
be&nbsp;some kind&nbsp;government program, right?</p> 
<p>I went to the computer to write up&nbsp;my report for the secret shopping 
job. I hate my computer. It came with this virus protection software, but the 
only thing it&rsquo;s done for the past two years is tell me my subscription is 
expired. It&rsquo;s annoying. Plus, when I opened my web browser (Internet 
Explorer 6) and tried to visit a website, this window popped up offering a free 
virus scan. I clicked &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and it found like ten infections. The 
software that came with my computer&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t even work!</p> 
<p>After the scan, there was a window that wouldn&rsquo;t go away, so I just 
closed the browser and checked my email. There, a miracle happened. It turns 
out I was entered&nbsp;in the lottery up in Canada, and I won! $2,500,000, all 
for me. I called the claims agent right away. It turns out there are some taxes 
and fees I have to pay first, but that&rsquo;s okay&mdash;they&rsquo;re going 
to mail me a check. I think I may retire from secret shopping. After all, with 
two-and-a-half million, I&rsquo;m going to be pretty much set for life.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell anyone about it, though. I don&rsquo;t want 
everybody asking me for money.</p> 
<p>My name is Johnny, and I made at least ten mistakes today, if not more. Can 
you spot them all?</p>

<h2>Online security: teach your children&nbsp;well.</h2> March 1, 2010 <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any kids yet, but I know a few people who do.</p> 
<p>Okay, so I know more than a few. I know many, and almost all of them have 
something in common: their computers are constantly being infected with 
viruses, trojans and other types of malware. I&rsquo;m not talking about the 
occasional adware popup or tracking cookie&mdash;these machines are usually 
just&nbsp;<em>crawling </em>with malicious software.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of an old myth that your twelve year old is always going 
to know more about the computer than you. Perhaps this is true when it comes to 
first-person shooters and making goofy videos, but kids don&rsquo;t know 
everything about computers, and security is one of those areas where they 
generally seem to lack the fundamentals.</p> 
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re invincible, too. There&rsquo;s always that. Ask 
them sometime; &ldquo;Is it even possible that you might run into a virus on 
the Internet?&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll probably look at you like you&rsquo;re an 
idiot. Again.</p> 
<p>But it happens, and it seems to happen a lot. You&rsquo;ve got to educate 
your kids about malicious software, because a keylogger doesn&rsquo;t care who 
downloads itself; it&rsquo;s going to send login and password information, 
whether it&rsquo;s to a Facebook profile (bad news) or your financial accounts 
(worse).</p> 
<p>First, if you&rsquo;ve got kids using the Internet, try to keep an eye on 
them at least some of the time. Since this is impossible, though, make sure 
you&rsquo;re usingFirefox with the NoScript plug-in. No Internet Explorer! 
There are more holes in that browser than a hunk of Swiss.</p> 
<p>Secondly, learn about the various dangers yourself, and make sure you warn 
your kids.<em>No</em> kid is going to be able to resist &ldquo;lol is this 
you?&rdquo; or &ldquo;lol funny video&rdquo; followed by a shortened URL, 
unless someone tells him that such links lead only to malware.</p> 
<p>Thirdly, obtain the burliest antivirus and firewall software you can 
afford, and pay the money&nbsp;to keep it updated. This is vital anyway, but if 
you&rsquo;ve got kids clicking a mile a minute on Facebook and Twitter, you 
really need to take maximum precautions.</p> 
<p>I suppose you <em>could</em> try to limit your kids&rsquo; access to the 
Internet, but you could also try to wrestle a grizzly bear while you&rsquo;re 
at it. Good luck with that one.</p> 
<p>Finally, consider getting your own computer or laptop that the kids 
aren&rsquo;t allowed to even<em>touch</em>, and use that one for business and 
banking. At least your accounts will be safe(r), assuming you&rsquo;re taking 
the necessary precautions on this computer as well.</p> 
<p>Okay, does this post officially put me in the &ldquo;old person complaining 
about young people&rdquo; camp? It does sort of have that &ldquo;I tell ya, the 
kids today, with their Facebooks and their Twitters,&rdquo; flavor 
doesn&rsquo;t it?</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I know it&rsquo;s important to get your kids hip to 
the dangers of malware as soon as you can. Your own&nbsp;financial security may 
depend on it.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Internet Explorer vs. Mozilla Firefox: which browser 
is&nbsp;safer?</h2> November 27, 2009 <br>

<p>Just the other day, news of a pretty major hole in Internet Explorer 
versions 6 and 7 was made public (no word on whether or not the vulnerability 
applies to version 8, which is the latest one at this time).</p> 
<p>Why did the &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; in question make this information public? 
Some people might assume he or she wants to cause widespread chaos, but I 
actually think it&rsquo;s good to publicly post things like this. This<em>forces
</em> Microsoft to come up with a patch for the problem as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, I&nbsp;recently decided I&rsquo;m sort of <em>done</em> with 
always waiting for Microsoft to patch browser software that has more holes than 
a hunk of Swiss, and made the switch to Mozilla Firefox.</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t really give you the tech-head reasons why I feel Firefox is 
the better, safer browser (mostly because I&rsquo;m not much of a tech-head), 
but a large portion of the Internet-savvy population agrees that it&rsquo;s the 
way to go.</p> 
<p>For one thing, Firefox is &ldquo;open source&rdquo; software. A whole 
community of programmers is constantly making improvements to it. Should the 
rare security vulnerability come to light, it&rsquo;s fixed in record time.</p> 
<p>Microsoft is at a disadvantage here. Being a huge corporation with 
shareholders&rsquo; interests as their primary concern, they have multiple 
levels of bureaucracy to work through before they can release<em>anything</em>. 
I&rsquo;m sure even a simple security patch is met with 
resistance&mdash;&rdquo;This will mean publicly admitting a weakness, which 
could hurt share prices!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Microsoft <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> release a great 
browser right out of the box, I just think that with their deadlines and the 
need to think about profitability above all else, they tend to rush releases 
before everything is ready.</p> 
<p>The cool thing about Firefox is that there are all kinds of plug-ins (or 
&ldquo;add-ons&rdquo;) available. Right now, I run the latest version of 
Firefox with a plug-in called &ldquo;NoScript.&rdquo; This nifty little program 
starts you off by blocking ALL Flash, Java and JavaScript programs. As you 
visit websites, you get to choose whether or not to allow it to run all, some, 
or none of the scripts embedded in the site.</p> 
<p>For example, if you visit Facebook, it will start by blocking every script. 
Then you can select &ldquo;Allow facebook.com&rdquo; to run scripts. There will 
usually be several different websites per page running scripts, so you can 
select whether or not you trust them. If you don&rsquo;t like the look of one 
of the URLs, simply don&rsquo;t allow that site to run code, or search for it 
on Google to find out what it is (for example, I don&rsquo;t let Fastclick.net 
run scripts. Ever).</p> 
<p>There are some other good plug-ins, most of which I haven&rsquo;t looked 
at. Some block pop-ups, some probably don&rsquo;t work too great at all. The 
Firefox site has a big list of available add-ons.</p> 
<p>There are a million better articles than this one&nbsp;about 
&ldquo;Internet Explorer vs. Firefox&rdquo; (just do a Google search), but if 
you&rsquo;re ready to switch now, godownload Firefox here and get the NoScript 
plug-in here.</p>
