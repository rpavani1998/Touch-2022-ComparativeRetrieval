<h1>IE 7 Vs Firefox 2.0</h1>  Frazier Barretto, Nov 12, 2006 1100 hrs IST

The wait for IE to join the league of the more easy-to-use, 
feature-rich browsers is over. While Firefox just entered the ring with many 
already popular browsers to compete with, it still managed to capture a good 
percentage of the market in a comparatively short span of time. IE has remained 
the most used browser ever since its version 5 release with Windows 98. Firefox 
began penetrating right from day one of its release. Now both IE and Firefox 
have come out with a new version. For IE it has been a leap, while for Firefox 
it's just been a hop-over from its already evolved product to a more evolved 
version. Just lately, we did a feature of the Firefox 2 beta, you can have a 
look at here . Firefox 2 hasn't changed much from its beta release; so, talking 
much about it would just be a mere repetition. We will look a lot more at IE 7 
and compare the two briefly. Let's kick off this concise feature about these 
two browsers as they battle it out for market share.<br>
<br>
<b>Looks</b> <br>

<br>The looks of IE 7 have been bumped up to feel all fresh and new. It's 
basically the Vista look and feel. This isn't a beauty contest, but that's what 
Microsoft personally feels making most of the changes to the whole of Vista 
family, mostly cosmetic. IE7, being a part of Vista, has also undergone 
cosmetic changes, and at the same time has even become a lot more feature-rich 
than its previous version.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p></p> <br>
This version of IE gives that all-clear look. If you keep a 
window of IE 7 open beside a window of IE 6, you will notice the changes and 
for all you know you might just not be able to tell if it's IE in the first 
place.<br>
<br>
That's unless you have seen or had a peek at Vista. IE 7 is 
better-looking than Firefox 2 (default skin) but that's not the only thing we 
actually want at the end of the day. While IE flaunts all the beauty, Firefox 
on the other hand hasn't changed much in terms of looks to make it look more 
cool.<br>
<br>

<p></p> <br>
Its previous version was very plain and simple and we all liked 
it. The newer version, looking at the competition, has the use of make-up and 
has done a few minor touch-up jobs. The buttons are neatly rounded off giving 
the button-bar a sweet look and at the same time has maintained its simplicity. 
IE 7, with its Vista look, has an all glass theme, the buttons and the whole 
look has been changed so that it syncs well with Vista. There is no doubt that 
IE 7 is better-looking, but Firefox with its simple beauty will still continue 
to capture more users.<br>

03:31 PM Any day Firefox is better than IE 7 . Simple, fast and reliable.Whats 
more, it has thousands of themes to enhance the look.IE 7 has only copied the 
idea from Firefox of tabbed browsing.The great add-ons make Firefox everyones

05:46 PM Hi Guys...IE7 is nothing near to Firefox when we compare the easy 
readability and useability of the firefox. IE is still leaps behind... if we 
need the looks mozilla provided with lots of skins to change and the firefox is 
much faster and it uses less system resources.. Report abuse <br>

firefox and has released a version. This article also talks about the look and 
feel of IE 7, if you guys want to try firefox with Vista look, please try Vista 
Fire Fox 1.5. Its simply amazing guys.. Long live Fire Fox :-) Report abuse <br>

,bangalore, on Nov 15, 2006 02:24 AM i have been using internet for past 6 
years . i have used many types of browsers and all latest browsers too right 
from ie 5.5 to ie 7.0 beta 3 and opera 7. 2 to opera 9.02 and firefox the day 
it was released for windows platform. Certainly , i have concluded in overall 
aspects firefox is the best and it will remain best . ie new version is nothing 
just copied firefox functionalities mostly,even opened a site for add-ons like 
firefox got . and firefox got many many features and it's pop bloc is best and 
the password remembering another good once plus the themes and add ons 
extensions many extra feature and ie spell check make it really good to use . 
IE takes long time to open the page and its tabbing browsing actually eats up 
the space and the password remembering doesn't work properly. where as opera 
got few good things like thru voice we can do many things and it's pop block up 
is best,but misses the extra features whch firefox got like extensions addon 
and download accelerator and ie spelling check .but certainly better than IE . 
finally ,Firefox is best then opera and followed by internet explorer Report

 sachin  ,goa, on Nov 13, 2006 11:00 PM when it comes to saving a 
complete web page (exectly as we see it while surfing),firefox saves a web page 
in a second or two where as IE takes a much longer time to do so.internet 
explorer could loose its market share at faster pace now due to addition of 
stupid genuine advantage with no real advantage seen over firefox.they are just 
trying to cath up with firefox with IE 7 and upcoming vista story is no 
different to MAC. Report abuse <br>
 ab1  ,mumbai, on Nov 13, 2006 01:49 AM As 
a user of all three browsers,firefox 2 is the fastest browser after u have 
installed fasterfox beating even opera 9.02 and ahead of ie7 by along way.Just 
the magnitude of extensions available for firefox should make it the best 
browser[u can even dl videos from you tube and google video with one 
extension].Just the fact that microsoft worked with firefox to make it 
compatible with vista shows its popularity.The only gripe with firefox is that 
uses a lot of memory compared to the the other two.There is even an extension 
in firefox which can change the rendering engine to ie.The best browser for me 
is firefox 2 , period Report abuse <br>

,Bangalore, on Nov 13, 2006 06:08 PM Opera already is overwhelmingly better 
than Firefox - no comparison there - i.e why TechTree is not doing a review of 
Opera vs Firefox. Honestly - other than &quot;Adblock&quot; which I must add is 
currently implemented from Opera 9 onwards - Opera is way better than Firefox. 
Extensions do add flavor to Firefox, but then I am so much comfortable with 
Opera - I have rarely felt the need for another browser. Especially love the 
mouse-gestures (which Firefox implements using extensions) which are there by 
default in Opera. Report abuse <br>

We are all sure that FireFox is better than IE7 in all possible ways... But 
still IE users are high in numbers, because of its association with windows... 
If M$ stopped attaching IE with its every windows (itz NOT GOING 2 HAPPEN), 
then FireFox can prove itself in &quot;No. of users&quot; contest also....

Firefox extension doesn't use Control-H, but allows you to minimize to the 
system tray when Firefox &quot;closes.&quot; Truth is that Firefox, with all 
its extensions, far surpasses any other browser in terms of functionality. The 
only thing Opera has on Firefox is speed. Of course, speed is important to a 
lot of people. Report abuse <br>

I've had so many problems with IE 5 that I probably will never go back to it. 
Firefox is so easy to use and very versatile. Since I've gotten Firefox, I have 
had no browser hijacks, no viruses, and virtually no spy or malware. Thanks 
Firefox for creating an easy to use browser that's safe Report abuse <br>

 ,Chennai, on Nov 12, 2006 01:26 PM Firefox is certainly better. Press control 
and + key, your text size increases. Use - for decreasing. In advanced options, 
one can turn on the feature to start searching as we type (instead of pressing 
ctrl + F). My only gripe is earlier 'find next' and other options would also 
appear once searching is started. Now it does not happen. Maybe, that too can 
be enabled somehow. Will have to find it out. Report abuse <br>
