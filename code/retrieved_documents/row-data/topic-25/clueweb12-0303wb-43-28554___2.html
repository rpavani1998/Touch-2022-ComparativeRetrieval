<h1>Firefox vs. Internet Explorer</h1> 
<p>by Mrs. Gardner</p> 
<p>Taking an online class can be a daunting experience in and of itself, but 
if students choose the proper tools, it will save them time and frustration, 
and learning online will be viewed as a very rewarding experience. Perhaps the 
most important tool for a rewarding online education is the correct browser. 
Currently, there are several browsers that a student might choose, and as with 
everything, each has pros and cons. The two most popular browsers are Internet 
Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.</p> 
<p>First, let me say that I used Internet Explorer as my browser of choice for 
the first eight to ten years of being online. Then, about five years ago, I 
came across some sites that claimed to work better with Firefox as a browser. 
So, wanting the best possible experience, I downloaded and started using 
Firefox as my preferred browser and found that it really did work better on 
many sites.</p> 
<p>However, being a creature of habit, I could not completely let go of 
Internet Explorer, and I found that many sites still worked best with it. In 
fact, at that time, many learning platforms (such as Blackboard) worked best 
with Internet Explorer. In the last few years, Mozilla has perfected Firefox to 
the point where more and more learning platforms and websites now work better 
with Firefox. For instance, Moodle (the platform we use here at Time4Writing) 
works better with Firefox than Internet Explorer.</p> 
<p>For instance, when using Internet Explorer, do you ever receive those pesky 
error messages that say Internet Explorer has had a problem and needs to be 
shut down? You know what happens next; you lose all the hard work you&rsquo;ve 
just completed. Grrr! However, I have been using Firefox as my primary browser 
for over three years now, and have never had such a problem.</p> 
<p>Firefox will also help Time4Writing students in other ways. For example, 
Firefox has a built in spell checker that underlines a misspelled word in red 
dots as soon as it is typed and has a space or punctuation placed after it. One 
click fixes the misspelled word, and students can continue on with their typing.
</p> 
<p>Firefox will also allow students to highlight a word or phrase, right-click 
it, and then use it to &ldquo;Search Google.&rdquo; This is a handy function 
for students writing essays, especially when wanting to know more about their 
topic.</p> 
<p>Finally, if something unexpected does happen, like a power failure and the 
computer shuts down, Firefox saves your settings. With Internet Explorer, 
nothing is saved. You would have to go back to each and every page on each 
window to continue working. With Firefox, as soon as the power comes back and 
you open your Firefox browser, everything is just as it was before the failure. 
This feature alone keeps me using Firefox as my preferred browser.</p> 
<p>Both MAC and PC users have found that Firefox is the best browser for 
achieving great results while working in Moodle (Time4Writing&rsquo;s learning 
platform). Of course, there are other browsers and each individual needs to 
find the one that works best for their endeavors. If you want to know more 
about Firefox, you can visit and download a free version of the browser at
http://www.mozilla.com. Downloading and setting up takes very little time or 
effort.</p> &lt; Comments (0)
