<h3>Internet Explorer 8 is more secure, and why the Firefox fanboys and the 
media need a security lesson</h3> 
<p>So Internet Explorer has been the media's main victim this past week. With 
stories about how it is completely unsecure.</p> 
<p>Of course having a vulnerability isn't a good thing, but why is this 
getting so much attention, especially considering it's not even being used to 
target individuals? Well I suppose the media have to knock Microsoft, it's 
about the only thing they can do when it comes to Microsoft so this will have 
to do.</p> 
<p>Tech Radar recently interviewed Microsoft's head security guy in the UK 
Cliff Evans. And did a pretty bad job of it. So Evans was explaining how 
switching away from Internet Explorer 8 isn't a good idea - something I agree 
with.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;If you were to ask me 'what's the most secure browser?' I would say 
Internet Explorer 8 &ndash; we're talking about a single vulnerability,&quot; 
he added.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Ouch a single vulnerability that's bad right? Some guy called richmurrils 
seems to think so and comments:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>That's the funniest thing I've read in ages. </p> </blockquote> 
<p>Of course what he really demonstrates is how little richmurrils actually 
knows about technology or security, I expect he was one of the people telling 
people to turn UAC off /facepalm, and how Tech Radar can't report things in 
context. So I'll put things in context even if they can't be bothered to, 
Firefox 3.5 has had at least 35 documented security vulnerabilities. Linux 
based operating systems can have hundreds of vulnerabilities discovered each 
year, Windows historically has had the fewest usually at just a dozen or two 
every year discovered. A single vulnerability isn't anything unusual.</p> 
<p>Of course nobody bothers reporting that this vulnerability can only be 
exploited on Internet Explorer 6, a 10 year old version and on Windows XP a 10 
year old operating system. Do Mozilla even bother to support such old products? 
Of course not.</p> 
<p>Alright sure the vulnerability still exists in later versions, but it 
cannot be exploited on newer systems because of the additional security 
measures Windows Vista and later provide. Namely Protected Mode made possible 
by UAC.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When using Firefox a hacker only has to exploit code in the browser to run 
code on the machine. Exploiting Internet Explorer not only requires them to 
find a vulnerability and exploit it but it also requires them to somehow break 
out of the Protected Mode sandbox. Charlie Miller a security researcher talks a 
bit about this back during the Pwn 2 Own contest:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Why Safari? Why didn't you go after IE or [Firefox]?</p> 
<p>It's really simple. Safari on the Mac is easier to exploit. The things that 
Windows do to make it harder (for an exploit to work), Macs don't do. Hacking 
into Macs is so much easier.<em>You don't have to jump through hoops and deal 
with all the anti-exploit mitigations you'd find in Windows</em> (Vista and 
later -Paul).</p> 
<p>It's more about the operating system than the (target) program. Firefox on 
Mac is pretty easy too. The underlying OS doesn't have anti-exploit stuff built 
into it.</p> 
<p>With my Safari exploit, I put the code into a process and I know exactly 
where it's going to be. There's no randomization. I know when I jump there, the 
code is there and I can execute it there.<em>On Windows, the code might show up 
but I don't know where it is. Even if I get to the code, it's not executable. 
Those are two hurdles that Macs don't have</em>.</p> 
<p>It's clear that all three browsers (Safari, IE and Firefox) have bugs. Code 
execution holes everywhere. But that's only half the equation. The other half 
is exploiting it. There's almost no hurdle to jump through on Mac OS X.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Of course 3rd parties could use Protected Mode on Windows Vista and later 
like IE7 and 8 do. But Mozilla, Opera and others simply don't bother. They let 
the process run with the same rights as the user which is fundamentally less 
secure then running the browser in its own little sandbox where it can't get 
out.</p> 
<p>In reality vulnerabilities like these are rarely what normal people come up 
against on the internet. The main problem is phishing and malware. Both of 
which are socially engineered to get the computer user to either hand over 
their data willingly or willingly install an application that's malicious. So 
how does Internet Explorer compare? IE8 blocks 83% of phishing websites 
completely, compared to Firefox which blocks 80%. While Internet Explorer 8 
blocked 81% of malware before it reached the machine. Firefox blocked less than 
30%, and other browsers scored even worse (source).</p> 
<p>So not only is it more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities on Internet 
Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and up. The malware and phishing filters are also 
better on IE8, something that will protect most computer users.</p> 
<p>One last comment is on how well Google and the media have spun this around 
from a story about how Google got broken into and people's personal data was 
stolen into a story about how a 10 year old browser on a 10 year old system has 
a single vulnerability, without even asking why Google are running such dated 
systems or without bothering to report that newer versions of IE aren't as 
susceptible. Nice spin department working there.</p> 
<p>Update: Mark informed me that Chrome also runs in a sandbox.</p>

<h3>We see you're using Internet Explorer</h3> 
<p>I just ran into another one of these stupid things.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>1) Internet Explorer 6 and 7 block pop-up windows.<br>
 2) Internet 
Explorer 7 on Windows Vista is more secure than Firefox.<br>
 3) OK let's hand 
control of the internet over to Mozilla Corporation.<br>
 4) Firefox still has 
plenty of bugs that impact developers and designers.<br>
 5) Internet Explorer 
7 already has tabbed browsing.</p> 
<p>Grow up. Your site works fine in Internet Explorer.</p>  Categories:

<h1>Paul Smith's Blog</h1>  My main areas of interest can be divided up into 
three neat little groups. Science, politics and technology. I'm an astronomer 
and sceptic. Some of my astro-photos can be found in mygallery. Politically I'm 
a socialist. Technology wise I'm a Microsoft MVP for Windows Desktop Experience 
and am actively involved in several online computing related communities. I 
also co-host a PC and console game related podcast calledGamercast. <br>
