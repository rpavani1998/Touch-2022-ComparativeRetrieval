<h2>Everything Microsoft is Doing Wrong</h2> 
<p>Google Chrome was launched with some minor success just nine months ago, in 
September 2008. Initially, it was only available for Windows users. 
Disappointing for Mac and Linux users? Sure. End of the world? No. Google 
Chrome for Mac is now available, but still fairly buggy. When Firefox was 
announced, was Microsoft scared that they [...]</p> Full Story <br>

<h2>Flock is a Joke.</h2> 
<p>Flock is a browser that tried to take off. They tried to do something that 
no one else was doing, nor should they be doing. Flock has tried time and time 
again to gain market share in the social networking space. Flock is built on 
Firefox, or at least it was. TechCrunch reports that Flock [...]</p> Full Story

<h2>Google Toolbar Marketing in Gmail</h2> 
<p>Gmail has helped revolutionize what e-mail is and how it operates. Through 
Gmail, Google has changed the way people experience and interact with e-mail, 
and for that, I am thankful. But one thing that still bugs me is the way their 
product marketing managers do not communicate. The Google Toolbar is a great 
toolbar, one [...]</p> Full Story <br>

<h2>Power Twitter Integrates with Google Maps</h2> 
<p>Power Twitter is a new Firefox addon, updated most recently as of 
yesterday. This little addon will enhance your twitter.com experience. I say 
twitter.com because it&rsquo;s not a client, so you need to be using both the 
web and Firefox to have the enhanced experience. One particular feature that 
this addon has is that it [...]</p> Full Story <br>

<h2>Weekend Breakup: Firefox Leaves Google for Yandex</h2> 
<p>Most recently, Firefox, after having been in bed with Google for quite some 
time, is shopping around for a new [Russian] partner. According to 
Mozilla&rsquo;s bug tracking system Bugzilla, there is a bug request to change 
the default search partner from Google to Yandex. This is all despite Mozilla 
and Google having a long-standing partnership [...]</p> Full Story <br>

<h2>How to Kill Facebook Ads in Firefox</h2>

<h2>Firefox Porn Browsing (Shaved Pussy)</h2> 
<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, but Google Chrome comes with &ldquo;private 
porn browsing&rdquo; mode which will basically let you browse the web and it 
won&rsquo;t track your history, cache, or cookies. Safari has had this function 
for quite a while. But now Firefox has it too! For all those people that want 
to view porn without [...]</p> Full Story <br>

<h2>The New Google Browser</h2> 
<p>Google announced today that they will be launching their own browser as of 
tomorrow (Tuesday, September 2nd, 2008). The browser name? Google Chrome. So 
what will make the Google Chrome browser better than Firefox, Safari, or 
Internet Explorer Opera? &ldquo;On the surface, we designed a browser window 
that is streamlined and simple.&rdquo; &ldquo;We also built [...]</p> Full Story

<h2>Google Extends Mozilla Partnership to 2011</h2> 
<p>Google and Mozilla&rsquo;s partnership contract was coming close to an end, 
November 2008 (two months away). But, at the Firefox Plus Summit, the contract 
has been renewed for another three years. This image below sums up pretty well 
what is happening right now. Here&rsquo;s a quote from the post, 
&ldquo;&hellip;the introduction of the browser concept [...]</p> Full Story <br>
<h2>Firefox 3 Launch Party</h2> 
<p>Two nights ago was the launch party for Firefox 3. We had a great time. The 
party was hosted by AdaptiveBlue, who provided the pizza and beer. Then 
notch.es sponsored the second round of pizzas which were devoured within 
minutes. The party was a blast! We had such a great time. A number of folks
