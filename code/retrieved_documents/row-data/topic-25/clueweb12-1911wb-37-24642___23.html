<p>A few weeks ago one of my developer friends was gushing about the 
capabilities of his favorite native platform. After every point I felt obliged 
to point out that the web platform either already had or was actively 
developing precisely the same capabilities&mdash;and then some. He was 
incredulous. &quot;Prove it,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>So I pulled together a few of my favorite examples from the cutting edge of 
the web platform and recorded three screencasts to help my friend&mdash;and 
others&mdash;meet the web platform again for the first time.</p> 
<p>The first video, Building on Foundations, goes over how the web platform 
has been fixing various historical shortcomings and building upon its core 
strengths, like complicated graphical effects, composability, and advanced text 
layout.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The next video, Learning from Other Platforms, reviews how the web platform 
offers new capabilities inspired by successes on other platforms with things 
like push notifications, payment APIs, and web intents.</p>

<p>Hundreds of millions play games on the web everyday - including most of us 
on the Chrome team. Between building new virtual cities and slaying dragons, 
we&rsquo;re also working on making the web a better platform for game 
developers. With&nbsp;GDC&nbsp;about to start, we wanted to give you a quick 
update on these efforts.</p> 
<p>First, we&rsquo;re collaborating with all browser vendors to give you 
access to exciting new HTML5 APIs such as&nbsp;Gamepad,Mouse Lock&nbsp;and&nbsp;
Fullscreen. These can help you create more immersive experiences for your users.

<p>All good things come in threes. So, this week, the Chrome Developer 
Relations team is releasing three new resources for developers.</p> 
<p>First, we are making available a brand new Field Guide to Web Applications, 
to help developers create great web apps. This guide walks you through topics 
like app design fundamentals, tips for creating great experiences and a few 
case studies that put the best practices to use. Whether you're building your 
first web app or are just looking for ways to improve your existing apps, we 
hope you'll find the field guide useful.</p> <b></b> 
<p>Second, our popular HTML5 site, HTML5Rocks.com, was also remodeled to 
better organize the site's content. You&rsquo;ll now find new &quot;persona 
pages&quot; with catered content in 3 different verticals (Games, Business, 
Mobile). In addition, we consolidated many of the different components, and 
deeply integrated theHTML5 technology classes to bring a better identity to the 
site.</p> 
<p>Finally, we've also joined Google+ with a new page specifically for Chrome 
Developers. Whether you&rsquo;re building modern web apps, using Dart or 
WebRTC, we&rsquo;ll be there to help you! Keep your eyes open for our weekly 
hangouts and add us to your circles.</p>

<h2>Google Chrome To Support Gamepads, Google &ldquo;Console&rdquo; On The Way?

<p>With the growing popularity of HTML5 games and applications, it looks like 
Google has a vision of its own.</p> 
<p>According to the EDGE, during the Develop Liverpool conference in London, 
Google&rsquo;s developer Paul Kinlan has announced that Google Chrome will 
receive gamepad support tin the first quarter of 2012. In addition to that, it 
will feature a support for cameras and microphones that don&rsquo;t have to be 
plugged in.</p> 
<p>While not many details were revealed, it is known that the search giant is 
already working on the next instance of its Google TV service, with the 
hardware set to debut sometime next year.</p> 
<p>Why add gamepad support anyway? If our speculation stands correct (and only 
time will tell), we guess that Google Chrome will be an essential part of 
Google TV, offering its users an ability to play HTML5 games on their TV with a 
gamepad attached. Think about it as Google&rsquo;s version of a gaming console.

<p>Cross posted at the Google Code blog </p> 
<p>This post almost wasn&rsquo;t written. </p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit too busy playing and testing new browser-based games 
such asMonster Dash, Angry Birds, and the newly released SONAR. Bigger and 
better games are coming to the browser rapidly (and just wait untilNative 
Client with 3D lands in Chrome), and it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with the 
technology and scene. So what better way to bring everyone together to share 
stories and keep up to date than to hold a conference dedicated to HTML5 game 
development?</p> <br>

<p>New Game, the first North American conference for HTML5 game developers, is 
now open forregistration. You are invited to join hundreds of HTML5 game 
developers for two days of technical sessions and case studies from developers 
and publishers who brought their games to the open web platform. The event will 
take place November 1-2, 2011 at the beautiful Yerba Buena Center for the Arts 
in San Francisco, CA.</p> 
<p>This year, New Game looks at what is possible in the browser <i>today</i>. 
Sessions will focus on the technologies that have elevated the browser-based 
gaming experience, such as WebGL, Canvas, and JavaScript performance 
techniques. In addition, the conference will feature sessions exploring and 
analyzing lessons-learned from recent HTML5 game launches.</p> 
<p>New Game is honored to have Rich Hilleman, EA&rsquo;s Chief Creative 
Officer, keynote the event. Theschedule also includes sessions from Mozilla, 
Spil, Opera, Google, Bocoup, GameSalad, Moblyng, and others. After the first 
day, we&rsquo;ll network with our colleagues and share high scores at the New 
Game party, open to all registered attendees.</p> <br>

<p>For more information on New Game, including session and speaker details, 
please visitwww.newgameconf.com and follow @newgameconf for the latest news. 
Google, the premier sponsor, and conference directorBocoup invite you to take 
advantage ofearly bird registration pricing, available for a limited time. </p> 
<p>The future of gaming is in your browser, so I&rsquo;ll see you at New Game! 
Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, it&rsquo;s time to get back to mySONAR tab. </p>

<p>Now that Google Chrome 11 has hit the beta channel, you can expect to see 
extension and Web app developers making use of the new HTML5 speech-to-text 
API. In fact, there's as least one slick extension you can already install:
Speechify.</p> 
<p>Install Speechify, and you'll see a microphone icon added into the search 
box on many popular sites -- like Google and Bing. Click it, and Speechify will 
convert the words you speak into text. You've still got to press enter or click 
to search, and an automatic submit option is definitely something we'd like to 
see added.</p>

<h2>Enable WebM video in Internet Explorer 9 with a Google plug-in</h2>

<p>Not too long ago, Microsoft released an extension for Google Chrome which 
enabled H.264 HTML5 video playback. Now Google has returned the favor by 
offering aWebM plug-in for Internet Explorer 9 users. In a move which we can 
only describe as oozing with self-confidence, Google points out that there are 
some known issues --visit this page, and revel in its blankness.</p> 
<p>If you plan on using IE9 but don't want to miss out on all the WebM videos 
which are popping up,download and install the plug-in now. The plug-in only 
works on Vista and Windows 7, but conveniently the same is true for IE9.</p>

<h2>Microsoft releases Google Chrome extension to enable H.264 HTML5 video</h2>

<p>Google has already announced that it would be dropping H.264 support from 
Chrome, but some other key players in the browser arena aren't backing down. 
Microsoft, of course, is standing behind MPEG-LA's codec -- and now it's making 
sure that Chrome users will still be able to view HTML5 video embeds which are 
encoded with it. The magic will be handled by a new browser add-on called
Windows Media Player Extension for HTML5. No, it's not a full-on plug-in -- 
which is kind of what we were expecting, given Microsoft's affinity forNPAPI 
tomfoolery.</p> 
<p>To add the extension to your Google Chrome install, just visit Microsoft's 
download page and agree to the alert you see above.</p>

<h2>Google Ditches H.264 Support In Google Chrome</h2> Submitted by admin on

<li>webm8</li> </ul> 
<p>The HTML5 web video wars are heating up again, this time with the news that 
Google has announced to remove support for the h.264 codec from the Chrome 
browser in the next couple months. Google product manager Mike Jazayeri admits 
that &rdquo; H.264 plays an important role in video&rdquo; but that Google has 
decided to direct their resources exclusively &ldquo;towards completely open 
codec technologies&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>What does it mean for Chrome users? Chrome will eventually only support 
HTML5 web videos that are making use of Google&rsquo;s own WebM (VP8) codec or 
Theora video codecs, and will refuse to play H.264 videos if the website in 
question streams video in that format only. While that&rsquo;s not the case for 
Youtube and maybe a few other sites, the majority of Internet sites will not 
encode their videos multiple times to make sure they can be watched in all 
browsers.</p> 
<p>Lets take a look at browsers and their HTML5 video support:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Google Chrome WebM8, Theora</li> 
<li>Firefox, WebM8, Theora</li> 
<li>Opera, WebM8, Theora</li> 
<li>Internet Explorer 9, H.264</li> 
<li>Safari, H.264</li> </ul> 
<p>Google Chrome until now was the only browser that supported all video 
codecs. Internet users now have the problem that their favorite browser may not 
be able to play videos that they want to watch on the Internet, which means 
that they need to keep a second browser installed, or download the videos to 
the computer to watch them locally.</p> 
<p>H.264 is the Blu-Ray codec and Apple makes use of it as well in their 
products. If you look at entertainment devices you notice that the majority 
plays H.264 but not WebM or Theora.</p> 
<p>The majority of commenters at the official blog announcement over at the 
Chromium blog appear to disagree with Google on the move. Some thing Google 
tries to push their own codec at the expense of the Chrome user experience, 
others state that the WebM8 codec is inferior to h.264 in quality.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s your take on this? And how will you handle HTML5 web video?</p>

 Google previously simplified attaching to and

HTML5-powered drag-and-drop to their Web interfaces. Now, the same feature is 
live on YouTube, enabling users to upload videos by simply dragging a clip from 
a desktop folder and placing into the dropzone on the YouTube upload page.
<p>As is the case with Docs and Gmail, you'll need to be using a compatible 
browser to be able to use drag-and-drop uploading. Currently, only Google 
Chrome and Firefox are supported.</p>  &nbsp;

<p>Earlier this year, in June, I ran the first of my side-by-side deathmatches 
to try and work out which, if any, of the browsers is truly the hardware 
accelerated king. As it turned out, Firefox 4 and Internet Explorer 9 were
pretty equally balanced. Just two months later, in August, Chrome had stolen 
the top spot and sent Firefox 4, in a fit of tears, to the bottom of the heap.
</p> 
<p>In the last five months, all three browsers have been maturing. Chrome has 
leapfrogged from version 7 to 9, Firefox has been working frantically on its 
JavaScript engine to catch Chrome, and Internet Explorer 9 has been quietly -- 
but confidently -- working behind the scenes on the entire package. The 
emergence of new features has all but ceased: all three vendors are now 
readying themselves for an epic market share battle at the start of 2011.</p>

<p>It's a damn sight better than Google's last attempt at an HTML5 showpiece, 
that's for sure. At least this one actually<em>works </em>with Firefox and 
Internet Explorer 9! It's a little bit slow with Opera, but there should be a 
hardware-accelerated beta version of Opera 11 any day now...</p>

<p><em>20 Things I Learned About Browsers And The Web</em> is a beautiful and 
educational example of what we can expect from the HTML5 Web. It was developed 
by the Google Chrome team to showcase both the power of its browser, and ofHTML5
 itself.</p> 
<p>20 Things is fully illustrated, too, and on each page a cheesy subtitle or 
piece of poetry awaits. Put simply, it's a delight. If you're a hardened Web

<h2>Google Chrome Frame leaves beta, brings HTML5 to legacy browsers</h2>

<p>Filed under: Developer, Utilities, Google, Browsers</p> 
<p>Google Chrome Frame, Google's plug-in for bringing HTML5 and the latest web 
apps to IE 6, 7, and 8, hasreached stable status and left beta. Chrome Frame 
lets developers of modern sites and web apps support legacy browsers, with the 
plugin handling the HTML5 rendering when a user's old browser -- ok, old 
version of IE -- can't get the job done.</p> 
<p>Chrome Frame is an alternative to more complex hacks that tend to slow 
sites down, but the beta tag probably scared some developers away. Well, now 
Chrome Frame is stable, so load times and crashes are way down. Some fairly 
big-name sites like DeviantART, HootSuite and github have already jumped on the 
Chrome Frame bandwagon, and I'm sure more will follow their lead.</p> 
<p>If you're already using the Chrome Frame beta, you'll be automatically 
updated to the stable version, and future updates will happen on the same 
update schedule as Chrome itself. If you're just getting started with Chrome 
Frame, you can check out Google's handy intro video after the jump.</p>
