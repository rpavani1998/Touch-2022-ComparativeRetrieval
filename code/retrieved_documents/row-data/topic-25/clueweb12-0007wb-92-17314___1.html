<p>I stumbled on Browse Happy today. It is a site recounting bad experiences 
with Internet Explorer, and strongly emphasizes the need to use better, more 
secure, and more standards compliant browsers.</p> 
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve converted to Firefox, and find it a much better 
program than Internet Explorer.</p> 
<p>But there are other browsers out there, such as Opera, Mozilla, and Safari. 
With the exception of Safari, which is for Mac OS X or better, these 
alternatives are available for all major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
</p> 
<p>Spread the word! Use a better browser!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to write a short article on why Internet Explorer is not 
the best browser, so stay tuned!</p>
