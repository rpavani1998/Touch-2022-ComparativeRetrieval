<h3>Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer Browser Falls Below 50% of Worldwide 
Market for First Time</h3> Tuesday, October 5th, 2010 
<p>Finally!!! IE is dying off. If you know any designers, then you know that 
there is a real hate towards IE, and to be honest, for good reason. If you just 
step back and try Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome, then no doubt you will 
choose Firefox or Chrome. They are simply better browsers. Firefox has a big 
following but Chrome is growing in popularity at a rapid rate.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t just take my word for it, read the press release from 
StatCounter:</p> 
<p>BOSTON &amp; DUBLIN&ndash;(BUSINESS WIRE)&ndash;Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet 
Explorer (IE) browser has fallen below 50% of the worldwide market for the 
first time according to StatCounter. The company&rsquo;s research arm, 
StatCounter Global Stats finds that Microsoft IE fell to 49.87% in September 
followed by Firefox with 31.5%. Google&rsquo;s Chrome continues to increase 
market share at an impressive rate and has more than tripled from 3.69% in 
September 2009 to 11.54% in September this year.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Just two years ago IE dominated the worldwide market with 67%.&rdquo;
<br> &ldquo;This is certainly a milestone in the Internet browser wars,&rdquo; 
commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. &ldquo;Just two years ago IE 
dominated the worldwide market with 67%.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>He added that Microsoft&rsquo;s agreement with European Commission 
competition authorities to offer EU users a choice and menu of browsers from 
March may have tipped IE below 50% globally.</p> 
<p>In Europe, IE market share has fallen to 40.26% in September this year from 
46.44% in September last year. In North America IE is still above 50% at 52.3% 
followed by Firefox at 27.21% and Chrome at 9.87%.</p> 
<p>The rise of Google Chrome in North America has also been impressive and in 
June it overtook Safari for the first time.</p> 
<p>StatCounter Global Stats are based on aggregate data collected by 
StatCounter on a sample exceeding 15 billion page views per month collected 
from across the StatCounter network of more than 3 million websites. 
StatCounter, which provides free website traffic information, publishes browser 
stats in its StatCounter Global Stats, a free online research tool. It also 
monitors Internet market share battles including Search Engines, Social Media 
and Operating Systems including mobile.</p>
