Browser (free) <br>
<br>
Everybody uses Internet Explorer to surf the 'net, 
right? Well, not quite any more. Our web stats do show that IE is the 
overwhelming choice of our readers, though there is a growing trend towards the 
&quot;Firefox&quot; browser.<br>
<br>
 If you haven't tried the 
&quot;Firefox&quot; browser from Mozilla.org, you're missing out on some great 
features missing from IE. (not to mention better security from all of those 
hackers going after flaws in IE). Some say once Microsoft got market dominance, 
they stopped working on improvements to IE. Firefox is an &quot;open 
source&quot; program, and therefore gets constant attention and improvements. 
(No wonder Microsoft is finally getting ready to roll over version 7 this year).
<br> <br>
 It's a free download at: <br>

 Here is a tech article that 
gives you 13 reasons why FIREFOX is better than Internet Explorer.<br>

 We 
switched a while back and haven't looked back. No, they are not a website 
sponsor, just a good product. And it's free!<br>

and if you downloaded an earlier 
version of the Firefox browser, like 0.9 beta or 1.0, be sure to download the 
newer version, 1.0.1. The new version plugs a security hole and loads much 
faster. <br>

Here is review written by another fan of the Firefox browser: <br>

<br> <b>Quote:</b> <br>
Internet Explorer is a good browser but it has become 
such a target for malicious exploits that it is now a major security risk. 
Quite separately, the browser itself is now looking dated with most alternative 
products offering tabbed browsing and other productivity enhancements. There 
are several excellent alternatives but Mozilla FireFox is the stand-out pick. 
It's much safer than Internet Explorer, so safe in fact that many users have 
reported no spyware infections since they started using the product. It's also 
browses faster than Internet Explorer and since the release of version 1.0, 
it's stable and reliable as well. It loads a little slower than IE but once 
running, it zips along at lightning speed. With tabbed browsing and more free 
extensions than you could ever want, it offers a major upgrade in your browsing 
experience. Unlike IE, it's also standards compliant. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Editor's note: The newest version, 1.0.1, released after this review loads 
faster still. <br>

Some &quot;hot key&quot; shortcuts 
for you Firefox browser<br>
<br>
<b>Quote:</b> <br>
ALT-D <br>
 to jump 
insertion point to address bar.<br>
<br>
 Instead of lunging for your mouse, 
try this slick technique for opening a new page. Press ALT-D, and your 
insertion point (cursor) will jump to the address bar. Then simply overtype the 
existing address.<br>
<br>
CTRL-Enter <br>
 to type &quot;www...com&quot; 
quickly.<br>
<br>
 When combined with ALT-D above, this works wonders! Once you 
are in the address bar, there is no need to type thehttp:// prefix or the www. 
or the .com domain names. Simply type the middle portion of the desired 
address, and press CTRL-Enter.<br>
<br>
 e.g. If you type CNN and press 
CTRL-Enter, you will go tohttp://www.cnn.com <br>
<br>
CTRL-Mouse wheel spin 
<br> to enlarge or shrink page font size <br>
<br>
 That screen font is too 
small or too large for you? No worries, simply spin your mousewheel while 
holding CTRL. Your font size changes incrementally.<br>
<br>
CTRL-T <br>
 to 
launch a new tab<br>
<br>
 A favorite trick for power Internet users... this 
enables you to read your Gmail or Hotmail, while searching Google, and 
simultaneously checking your stocks and weather reports.<br>
<br>
 CTRL-T 
launches a new tab (effectively a new browser window, but without all the 
memory overhead of a full window).<br>
<br>
SHIFT-Click a link <br>
<br>
 to 
launch a new window with the link.<br>
<br>
 If you are doing research, and 
wish to keep your current location while browsing another, use SHIFT while you 
click on a link. The new page opens in a second window. <br>
<br>

CNet reviews 
six web browsers and gives Firefox the gold star.<br>
<br>
 Netscape and Safari 
tied for second place, and IE 6, Deepnet and Opera brought up the rear. If you 
haven&#146;t already, download the free Firefox, which is also 
Lifehacker&#146;s pick of best browser for Windows, Mac and Linux.<br>
<br>

http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3118_7-6226062-1.html?tag=cnetfd.sd <br>
<br>
 
Firefox is the browser of choice for Fastpitchwest, and can be downloaded for 
free here:<br>
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ <br>
<br>
 Firefox has 
a built in &quot;news reader&quot;, which permits you to get RSS feeds (like 
emails) for each new post at both the Morning Brief and The Deuce.<br>
<br>
 If 
you have or get Firefox, and need help setting up the RSS feeds, email us here 
at Fastpitchwest. (Click that &quot;Contact Us&quot; link at the bottom of this 
or any other page). We'd be happy to help. <br>

Major upgrade for the Firefox web browser, from 1.07 to the latest, version 
1.5. Just out today.<br>
<br>
 Better than Internet Explorer, and best of all, 
it's still FREE.<br>
<br>
 More &quot;add-on's&quot; (extensions, they call 
them) than you can count, as the open source community continues to come up 
with new ones nearly every day.<br>
<br>
 Download it here: <br>

And for those of you who find yourself at 
computers other than your own -- that don't have the Firefox browser installed, 
now there is &quot;Portable Firefox&quot;, which lets you carry it in your 
pocket, on your USB Thumb drive or such:<br>
<br>
<b>Quote:</b> <br>
Portable 
Firefox is a fast, full-featured web browser that&#146;s easy to use. It has 
all the same great features as regular Firefox including popup-blocking, 
tabbed-browsing, integrated search, improved privacy features, automatic 
updating and more. Plus, it leaves no personal information behind on the 
machine you run it on, so you can take your favorite browser along with all 
your favorite bookmarks and extensions with you wherever you go. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Download Portable Firefox here: <br>

If you are using 
the Firefox browser, you may already know about &quot;extensions&quot;, those 
slick little add ons for your browser that make life easier. Now that the new 
and improved Firefox version 1.5 has been out for a week or two, many of the 
&quot;extensions&quot; have been updated for the new version. We won't begin to 
try to cover all the goodies, except to say: &quot;Click Tools, Extensions, and 
Get More extensions&quot;. You can peruse the pages at Mozilla to see what is 
there.<br>
<br>
 We will take time to plug one that many of you will find 
handy. It'sFoxmarks, which permits you to sych your bookmarks, so that if you 
use firefox on more than one computer (work and home, or home and laptop), you 
can one-click your bookmarks for both.<br>
<br>
 Here's the link to download it:
<br> http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/Main_Page <br>
<br>
 You'll see a note that 
they are in &quot;Beta&quot;, but I can tell you from first hand experience 
that it works great.<br>
<br>
 On a related note, remember that you can drag 
and drop your favorite sites onto the Firefox browser bar right below the URL. 
So you can have sites like Fastpitchwest, GHFL.ca, ISCfastpitch, Mornng Brief, 
The Deuce and more all right there on your browser for easy access.<br>
<br>
 
And, if you're among the many still using Internet Explorer, ah well, you have 
my sympathies. <br>

Firefox Browser 2.0, a major upgrade has been 
released for free download:<br>

http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0/win32/en-US/ 
<br> <br>
 Actually, the official release date is tomorrow, October 24, 2006, 
but you can download it now from the link above. (It is the official, for 
release version, not a beta version). It installed and runs fine here.<br>
<br>

 Among the improvements you'll notice, it loads faster.<br>
<br>
 If you're 
still using Internet Explorer, see above. <br>
