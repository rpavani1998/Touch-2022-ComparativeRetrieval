<h1>Computer Hardware &amp; Software Guidelines</h1> 
<h2>College of Nursing and Health Professions</h2> 
<p>The <b>Blackboard Learning SystemTM</b> is the web-based course management 
system in use at the<b>College of</b><b> Nursing and Health Professions</b>. 
Blackboard makes it possible for faculty to deliver entire courses online or to 
supplement traditional on-campus classes with online content. The classes may 
be more convenient, but they are just as challenging.</p> 
<p>Students in online courses need a high degree of self-motivation to 
compensate for the absence of a classroom and face-to-face faculty interaction. 
Instructors set specific deadlines for work throughout the term and class 
participation &mdash; including live virtual classroom meetings, threaded 
discussions, and regular email communication &mdash; is critical to success and 
is factored into a grade.</p> 
<p>Students should be comfortable with basic computer skills, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sending and receiving email</li> 
<li>Researching topics via the Web</li> 
<li>Attaching, sending, and opening documents</li> 
<li>Participating in online chats</li> 
<li>Functioning in library databases</li> </ul>

virtual class meeting room. Since some courses include mandatory virtual 
classroom sessions, you will need to plan your schedule around these 
&ldquo;live&rdquo; sessions. Instructors schedule the class meetings ahead of 
time for your convenience. Check with your instructor to see what the Wimba 
requirements are for your course. Prior to the first scheduled classroom 
session, please make sure your computer is set up properly and do not wait 
until the last minute to access your Wimba classroom. In addition,<b>you will
