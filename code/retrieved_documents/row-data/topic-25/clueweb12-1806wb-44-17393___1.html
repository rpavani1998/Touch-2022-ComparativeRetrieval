 Set 
Internet Explorer and Firefox to maximize your security <br>

<p>Modern browsers are much better than their predecessors were at keeping 
your Web activity private and your data safe.</p>
<p>Still, you may not have your browser configured to provide optimum 
security. Take a few minutes to give Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 a safety 
check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> <strong>Batten down IE7's hatches</strong></h4>
<p>The version of IE7 for Vista adds the Protected Mode, which allows Web 
sites to access only the Temporary Internet Files folder on your PC.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, this feature is on by default for the Internet, 
Intranet, and Restricted zones, but disabled for the Trusted Sites and Local 
Machine zones. You will see &quot;Protected Mode: On&quot; in the status bar 
when it's active, or click Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security, and make 
sure &quot;Enable Protected Mode (requires restarting Internet Explorer)&quot; 
is checked at the bottom of each zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> There have been some reports of Protected Mode causing problems, so if a 
particular page won't load or run correctly, disabling this feature may solve 
the glitch, though I don't recommend keeping Protected Mode off. The Web's not 
getting any safer, and you need all the protection you can get.</p>
<p> Another great new feature in IE7--for XP and Vista alike--is the Phishing 
Filter. Why the filter is off by default I'll never know. To activate it, click 
Tools &gt; Phishing Filter &gt; Turn On Automatic Website Checking &gt; OK. 
Unfortunately, choosing Tools &gt; Phishing Filter &gt; Phishing Filter 
Settings merely opens the Advanced Internet Options dialog box, where you can 
scroll down to the Phishing Filter section under Security, only to find that 
your only two options are to disable the filter, and to &quot;turn off 
automatic website checking.&quot; But while you're in the Advanced Options 
settings, make sure &quot;Automatically check for Internet Explorer 
updates&quot; is checked in the Browsing section. Click OK when you're done.</p>
<p> Get into the habit of covering your browsing tracks on a regular basis. In 
IE7 you can wipe out your browser history, Temporary Internet Files, cookies, 
saved form data, and saved passwords at one time by clicking Tools &gt; Delete 
Browsing History &gt; Delete All. Or erase each category separately by clicking 
the appropriate button in the Delete Browsing History dialog box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Stay safe while browsing with Firefox</strong></h4>
<p> Just because Mozilla's open-source browser has a reputation for security 
doesn't mean you can use it to visit any site on the Web without a care in the 
world.</p>
<p>There is a free add-on available for Fireefox, called NoScript , that lets 
you decide which scripts can run on which Web pages on a case-by-case basis. If 
you use Firefox regularly and you haven't added NoScript, download and install 
it, and in no time you'll wonder how you ever browsed without it.</p>
<p> There's another simple step you can take to improve Firefox's security: 
Make sure you have the browser set to update automatically. The current version 
is 2.0.0.12; to check your copy's version, click Help &gt; About Mozilla 
Firefox, and look for the version number under the product's name.</p>
<p>To verify that the program updates automatically, click Tools &gt; Options 
&gt; Advanced &gt; Updates, and make sure Firefox is checked under 
&quot;Automatically check for updates to.&quot; You may also want to check 
&quot;Automatically download and install the update&quot; under &quot;When 
updates to Firefox are found.&quot; Also check &quot;Installed Add-ons&quot; 
under the former, and &quot;Warn me if this will disable any of my 
add-ons&quot; under the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Not long ago an attempt was made to spoof Firefox's address bar to fool 
people into thinking they were on a site other than the one they were actually 
visiting when a link opened in a new window. The simplest way to avoid this is 
by setting Firefox to open links in a new tab rather than a new window: Click 
Tools &gt; Options &gt; Tabs, and make sure &quot;A new tab&quot; is selected 
under &quot;New pages should be opened in.&quot; You can also disable this 
feature by typing about:config in the address bar, pressing Enter, navigating 
to dom.disable_window_open_feature.location, and double-clicking it to change 
it to &quot;true&quot;.</p>
<p> Web sites often know the page you were on before you opened one of their 
pages. To block this referrer header, type about:config in the address bar, 
press Enter, navigate to network.http.sendRefererHeader, double-click it, and 
set the integer value to 0.</p>
