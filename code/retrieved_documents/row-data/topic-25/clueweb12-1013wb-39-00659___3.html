<p>Here is a script from IBM&rsquo;s new CoScripter, to update your Facebook 
status:</p>  * go to &quot;http://www.facebook.com&quot; <br>
 * enter your 
&quot;e-mail address&quot;(e.g. tlau@tlau.org ) into the &quot;Email:&quot; 
textbox<br>
 * enter your password into the &quot;Password:&quot; textbox <br>
 
* click the &quot;Login&quot; button<br>
 * click the &quot;Profile&quot; link 
<br>  * click the &quot;Update your status...&quot; link <br>
 * enter your 
status into the status field 
<p>It reads just like the instructions you might write down for someone, but 
it&rsquo;s an actual executable script. All the scripts are stored on a wiki so 
anyone can share and update them.</p> 
<p>Very interesting&hellip; And definitely not your grandfather&rsquo;s IBM.

<p>This is too strange to believe, but it is true.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that it is impossible to log in as a registered user 
here atmg.to using Internet Explorer, even though other browsers work fine.</p> 
<p>Now I know why:</p> 
<p>Internet Explorer does not set a cookie for two-letter domains (Microsoft 
Knowledge Base)</p> 
<p>IE and 2-letter domain-names (crisp&rsquo;s blog)</p>

<h2>Basic Firefox tweaks</h2>  Michael Geary | Wed, 2004-11-10 16:39  category

<p></p> 
<p>Mozilla Firefox is a mighty fine browser right out of the box. If you 
haven&rsquo;t tried it out yet, I highly recommend it.</p> 
<p>Firefox is also highly customizable. Here are some basic tweaks that make 
Firefox even better.</p> 
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p> 
<p>The first thing I do when I install Firefox is open the <strong>
Tools/Options</strong> dialog and adjust a few of the settings there. On the 
<strong>General</strong> page, I click the <strong>Fonts &amp; Colors</strong> 
button and choose better fonts. By default, Firefox uses the mediocre Times New 
Roman and Arial fonts.<strong>Georgia</strong> and <strong>Verdana</strong> are 
much more readable choices for the<strong>Serif</strong> and <strong>Sans-serif
</strong> fonts.</p> 
<p>I also change both of the <strong>Size (pixels)</strong> settings to 
<strong>18</strong>, and the <strong>Minimum font size</strong> to <strong>14
</strong>. Finally, I change the <strong>Display resolution</strong> to <strong>
120 dpi</strong> to match my Windows setting.</p> 
<p>Here are my font settings:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>These are tuned to look good on the high-density 1600 x 1200 15&rdquo; 
display on myThinkPad. On a lower-density display you may prefer other 
settings, but in any case you&rsquo;ll find it worthwhile to spend some time in 
this dialog.</p> 
<p>The Display resolution setting has an unusual user interface. You 
don&rsquo;t specify the resolution directly; instead you select Other&hellip; 
in the dropdown combo box, and then another dialog pops up with a line 
you&rsquo;re supposed to measure. That&rsquo;s nifty, but I just wanted to set 
it to 120 dpi, so I tried various values in the dialog until I found that 6.35 
centimeters was the magic number.</p> 
<p><strong>Downloads</strong></p> 
<p>By default, Firefox saves all downloaded files on your desktop. I keep a 
Downloads folder with subfolders for the various programs and files I download. 
So back in the Options dialog&rsquo;s<strong>Downloads</strong> page, I set it 
to<strong>Ask me where to save every file</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Tabbed Browsing</strong></p> 
<p>In the <strong>Advanced</strong> page of the Options dialog, I change the 
<strong>Open links from other applications in</strong> setting to <strong>a new 
window</strong>. The default setting is <strong>the most recent tab/window
</strong>, which I don&rsquo;t like at all. When I click a link in some other 
application such as my email client, I don&rsquo;t want it to replace a website 
that I had already open, I want a new window.</p> 
<p>Firefox&rsquo;s tabbed browsing is wonderful, BTW. I use it to group 
related sites together in a single window. For example, I often investigate 
several topics in parallel. Typically I start by opening a new Firefox window 
and doing a Google search. Then I hold down the Ctrl key and click on various 
links from the search results. These pages all open as tabs in that same window.
</p> 
<p>Then I may have some other topic to research, so I open another new window 
and repeat the same procedure. So each window contains a set of related search 
results. It&rsquo;s a great way to organize related pages, and you can save the 
entire set of tabs in a window together in a bookmark folder to re-open them as 
a group later.</p> 
<p><strong>Extensions</strong></p> 
<p>Firefox has hundreds of extensions available from the official site and the 
unofficialTexturizer site. I like to keep my Firefox lean and fast, so I only 
use a few of them. Here&rsquo;s my basic set:</p> 
<p><strong>IE View</strong></p> 
<p>Alas, there are still some websites that are hard coded to work only with 
Internet Explorer, andIE View makes it convenient to get to those sites.</p> 
<p><strong>Clone Window</strong></p> 
<p>I like the way IE duplicates a window&rsquo;s current state when you use 
Ctrl+N to open a new window. Firefox by default opens your home page in a new 
window when you use Ctrl+N, and if you use Ctrl+T to open a new tab, the new 
tab is blank.</p> 
<p>I like IE&rsquo;s window cloning, so the Clone Window extension fixes this. 
I set its Options to<strong>New Window command should open: Cloned Window
</strong> and <strong>New Tab command should open: Cloned Tab</strong>.</p> 
<p>Clone Window isn&rsquo;t listed on the official Firefox update site, so 
when you click the installation link it you&rsquo;ll get a warning at the top 
of the Firefox window that www.pikey.me.uk is trying to install software on 
your computer. Click the Edit Options button which will open the Allowed Sites 
dialog, then click Allow and OK. Finally, click the installation link again to 
install the Clone Window extension.</p> 
<p><strong>Googlebar</strong></p> 
<p>Firefox includes a basic Google search (along with several other searches) 
in its standard toolbar, but it doesn&rsquo;t have all of the features of the 
Google toolbar for IE. TheGooglebar brings these goodies to Firefox. One thing 
it doesn&rsquo;t have isPageRank, but there are a number of variations of the 
Googlebar that include PageRank.</p> 
<p>Like Clone Window, Googlebar isn&rsquo;t listed on the official Firefox 
update site yet. The installer is locatedhere (or via the link above). Follow 
the same procedure described for Clone Window to install it.</p> 
<p>There are a lot more extensions than that. Every time I look at one of the 
Firefox extension sites I see something else I&rsquo;m tempted to try, such as 
the niftyWayback extension which gives you easy access to historical versions 
of sites from theInternet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine.</p> 
<p><strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong></p> 
<p>You probably know that Internet Explorer lets you go to a .com site without 
typing the www. and .com; just enter the domain name without those and hit
<strong>Ctrl+Enter</strong>. Firefox does that too, and it also lets you use 
<strong>Shift+Enter</strong> for a .net site and <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Enter
</strong> for a .org site. So, you can type &ldquo;archive&rdquo; in the 
address bar, hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter, and you&rsquo;re at the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>You can increase the text size of any site (<em>any</em> site) with <strong>
Ctrl+Plus</strong> (you don&rsquo;t need the Shift key, so I suppose it&rsquo;s 
really Ctrl+=, but it&rsquo;s easier to remember it as Ctrl+Plus), and decrease 
the text size with<strong>Ctrl+Minus</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Ctrl+B</strong> opens the handy Bookmarks sidebar. Even if you like 
to use the Bookmarks menu to access your bookmarks, the sidebar is a great for 
creating them. To the left of the site address (URL) in the address bar there 
is an icon for the website you&rsquo;re viewing. Drag that into the Bookmarks 
sidebar wherever you want it. (If there&rsquo;s no icon, the blank spot to the 
left of http: will work as an icon anyway.)</p> 
<p>The rest of the keyboard shortcuts are listed in the Firefox help.</p> 
<p><strong>Sorting your bookmarks</strong></p> 
<p>Firefox displays its bookmarks in some peculiar order by default. You can 
easily sort them by name, though.</p> 
<p>For the Bookmarks menu, open the menu and right-click on any of the 
bookmarks, then select<strong>Sort by Name</strong>.</p> 
<p>You can sort the Bookmarks sidebar (Ctrl+B) by opening the separate 
Bookmarks Manager using<strong>Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks</strong>. On the 
<strong>View</strong> menu are several sort options which apply to the 
Bookmarks sidebar as well as the Bookmarks Manager.</p> 
<p><strong>Advanced tweaks</strong></p> 
<p>Fans of Reason Magazine&rsquo;s lively Hit &amp; Run blog may have noticed 
that the text on this blog comes out really tiny in Firefox, because of some 
unfortunate font choices in in the style sheets used on this site. This is 
likely to improve now that some of the Reason staffers haveswitched to Firefox.
</p> 
<p>But there&rsquo;s no need to wait for Reason to fix their site. The font 
settings I listed above will fix most of the problems at Hit &amp; Run. The one 
remaining problem is that the type used for comment text is still too small. 
It&rsquo;s easy enough to fix this with Ctrl+Plus, but a better fix is to 
override Reason&rsquo;s style sheet. If you don&rsquo;t mind a bit of text 
editing, this is easy to do.</p> 
<p>First, you need to find the &ldquo;profile&rdquo; folder for Firefox. On a 
Windows 2000 or XP system, this is located in:</p> 
<p><code>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your name</em>\Application 
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles</code></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a hidden folder, so you&rsquo;ll need to use <strong>
Tools/Options</strong> on the Windows Explorer folder window and go to the 
<strong>View</strong> tab, then turn on the <strong>Show hidden files and 
folders</strong> option.</p> 
<p>On a Windows 98 or Windows Me system, the Firefox profile is likely to be 
in:</p> 
<p><code>C:\Windows\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles</code></p> 
<p>That location may be different if you&rsquo;ve enabled multi-user settings 
in the Users control panel. If you don&rsquo;t find it, use<strong>
Start/Find/Files or Folders</strong> to search for the Firefox folder.</p> 
<p>Inside the <code>Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles</code> folder on your system, 
you&rsquo;ll see a folder with a name like<code> v7qf3bzn.default</code>. This 
is your actual Firefox profile folder. Firefox uses randomized names like this 
to help protect your profile against intruders.</p> 
<p>Inside <em>that</em> folder is a folder called <code>chrome</code>. This is 
where you can do some interesting customization. In a fresh Firefox 
installation, there are two files here with a few examples of what you can do.
<code>userChrome-example.css</code> is for customizing the 
&ldquo;chrome&rdquo;, things like the menu bar, toolbars, and such.<code>
userContent-example.css</code> is about the content of a web page, and 
it&rsquo;s the one we&rsquo;re interested in here.</p> 
<p>Copy <code>userContent-example.css</code> to <code>userContent.css</code> 
and then edit that new file. Add this text to the end and save the file:</p> /* 
Override Reason Hit &amp; Run comment style */ <br>
<br>
 div .comments-body { 
<br>  &nbsp; font-family: Georgia, serif !important; <br>
 &nbsp; font-size: 
.95em!important; <br>
} <br>

<p>Now close all Firefox browser windows, re-open Firefox and visit Hit &amp; 
Run again. The comment text will display in the more readable Georgia font at a 
decent size, instead of the small Times font it uses by default.</p> 
<p>One limitation here is that changes in <code>userChrome.css</code> apply to 
<em>all</em> sites that happen to use the same style tag, so this may affect 
other sites besides the one you want to customize. But it can still be very 
useful for sites like this.</p> 
<p>Update: added installation information for Clone Window and Googlebar, and 
bookmark sorting information.</p>

<h2>Internet Explorer below 50%</h2>  Michael Geary | Tue, 2004-09-21 12:11

<ul> 
<li>Browsers</li> 
<li>Software</li> </ul> 
<p>I just saw something amazing in my site stats: Of the browsers that AWStats 
recognizes (which is most of them), Internet Explorer accounts for fewer than 
50% of the visits tomg.to in September.It&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve 
seen this happen on any site.</p> 
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t include RSS feeds, just browser visits.</p> 
<p>Last month, the top browsers were:</p> 
<pre>70.0% Internet Explorer 13.1% Firefox 5.7% Mozilla 4.4% Opera 3.3% Safari
</pre> 
<p>This month to date, they are:</p> 
<pre>49.7% Internet Explorer 16.4% Firefox 12.4% Opera 10.9% Mozilla 4.5% 
Safari</pre> 
<p>Of course, time will tell if this is a real trend or just the normal 
fluctuation of a new site. But still, it was cool to see.</p> 
<p>Go team! :-)</p>
