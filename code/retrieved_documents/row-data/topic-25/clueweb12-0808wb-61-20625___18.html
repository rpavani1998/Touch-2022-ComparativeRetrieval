<p> Application server administer tools<br>
<i>Application server 
administration tools are designed to help administrators deploy, build up, and 
carry out all application operations between an organization's backend 
databases and the users. Application servers are software engines that deliver 
applications to client computers and devices while handling a good amount of 
the business logic and data acess of the application. LAMP (Linux, Apache, 
MySQL, and PHP) is a stack software solution that provide a way to deploy rich 
Web 2.0 applications on inexpensive clusters of service computers. Java 
Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application server is another open source 
application server, along with it's commercial open source counterpart, Red 
Hat's JBoss appserver. Others include Apache Application Server, Perl Server, 
and Enterprise JaveBeans. Learn how to manage these applications and how to use 
them to your advantage within your Linux system.</i></p> 
<p> Network tools<br>
<i>OpenSSH, Nagios, and Autofocus are just a few 
examples of Linux network tools. Linux network tools consist of network 
performance monitoring, routing, and connectivity tools used on the Linux 
network. These tools help improve network performance and reduce downtime, 
configure routers, secure tunnels, and access network areas outside your local 
LAN.</i></p> 
<p> Scripting tools<br>
<i>Linux features powerful scripting languages like 
Bash, PHP and Perl, thus demanding scripting tools to execute script commands. 
Shell scripts allow several commands that would be entered manually at a 
command line to be executed automatically and quickly. Administrators and users 
use shell scripting tools to improve backup runs, purge /tmp directories, 
monitor processes and create users, among many other tasks. Some applications 
are written in shell script, and some users rely on shell scripts for 
installation or integration purposes. Shell customization, the list command, 
and hex codes are all scripting tools that can help improve the quality, 
security, or performance of the shell script.</i></p> 
<p> Mozilla<br>
<i>Mozilla tools are used to improve the performance, 
optimization, and security of the Mozilla platform, a free, open source browser 
and set of applications descended from the Mozilla Application Suite. With the 
Mozilla platform and Mozilla tools, IT shops can better handle quick hats and 
desktop business process tasks, as well as Windows-to-Linux migrations and 
interoperability. Mozilla tools consist of the browser, e-mailer, composer, and 
the DOM Inspector and JavaScript debugger in the Web space.</i></p> 
<p> Security tools<br>
<i>Linux security tools are developed to defend and 
protect your Linux platform. Vulnerability scanning, monitoring, and 
intrusion-detection tools are all security tools you can implement that can 
protect your Linux platform from hackers, malicious code, and inappropriate 
use. Snort, Nessus, Netstat, OSSIM and Bastille Linux are all tools that can 
shield your system.</i></p> 
<p> Management and administration tools<br>
<i>Management and administration 
tools cater specifically to the Linux manager and administrator. These tools 
help administrators complete tasks such as monitoring Linux activity with 
performance reporting commands, implementing integrated remote control with 
remote management tools, and using Webmin to ease DNS management. Other 
management and administration tools used to simplify these duties consist of 
Nagios, top, and Puppet.</i></p> 
<p> Desktop tools<br>
<i>The final featured category featured in our learning 
guide are desktop tools. From desktop virtualization tools to the latest 
OpenOffice upgrade, these desktop tools improve the performance, security 
features, and accessibility of the Linux desktop and Linux enterprise desktop.
