<h3>Firefox overtakes Internet Explorer on formoda.co.uk</h3> 
<p><strong>4th February 2011 @ 1:59pm</strong></p> 
<p>We always keep an eye on our website statistics and it was interesting to 
spot that in 2010 Firefox overtook Internet Explorer as the most popular 
browser for visitors to www.formoda.co.uk</p> 
<p>Internet Explorer has long been the dominant player in the Internet browser 
stakes and we are always hearing that &quot;everyone uses IE&quot;, well 
hopefully this will start to dispel that myth.</p> 
<p>These are the latest visitor figures for January 2011</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Firefox 37.5%</li> 
<li>Internet Explorer 33.6%</li> 
<li>Google Chrome 15.9%</li> 
<li>Safari 7.3%</li> </ul> 
<p>Compare that with Formoda's first full month back in March 2007 and you can 
see the real shift away from Internet Explorer.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Firefox 32.6%</li> 
<li>Internet Explorer 60.2%</li> 
<li>Google Chrome 1.8%</li> 
<li>Safari 4.4%</li> </ul> 
<p>Now we know these statistics are just for visitors to our website and we 
know that they/you are a pretty enlightened bunch and therefore more likely to 
use more improved browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari and this 
might not be the same across the whole Internet but we can but hope it is a 
step in the right direction.</p> 
<p> It is also worth noting that although Formoda test and make our websites 
work in the most widely used versions of Internet Explorer, it often causes us 
problems as they just don't work as well as all the other Internet browsers.</p>
<p>If you are still on Internet Explorer and would like to explore other 
options, why not visit the websites of<strong>Firefox</strong>, <strong>Google 
Chrome</strong> or <strong>Safari</strong></p>
