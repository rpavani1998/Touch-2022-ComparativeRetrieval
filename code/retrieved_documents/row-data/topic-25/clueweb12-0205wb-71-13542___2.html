<li> Final Thoughts: Better Browsing </li> 
<li> </li> </ul> <i>(From ExtremeTech.com)--</i>For a long time, there was 
nothing to talk about in web browsers. You used Internet Explorer, and that was 
it. Oh, to be sure, some Mozilla/Netscape holdouts clung to their ways, as did 
a smattering of users of Opera, Konqueror, and other obscurities. Internet 
Explorer itself hasn't had a major version change since the release of 6.0 in 
2001, so there wasn't much to talk about there, either for five long years.
<p>That's all changed, thanks to that phoenixlike incarnation of Netscape 
technology, Firefox. In one year, the open-source darling Firefox has pulled 
within a dead heat of browser the browser popularity crown, at least on the 
ExtremeTech site, where each browser claims just over 43 percent of our 
viewers. This spurred Microsoft to leave off its complacency, and serious 
development of the formerly dominant browser restarted in earnest.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, big changes have or are about to occur in three 
well-known browsers:Internet Explorer is finally being updated, with version 7 
in its third beta and almost ready to roll out the door;Firefox is also 
ripening an upgrade beta for its Version 2.0&mdash;it's in beta 1; and finally
Opera, which has a devoted but smaller following, has recently come out with 
Version 9.0.</p>
<p>So, three new browsers in the same year, after no action for a half decade. 
How do they stack up? We do a comparison of features, usability, memory, and 
disk usage to help you decide which you should spend your hard earned&#133;oh 
wait a minute, they're all free, so you can pick the one you want without 
worrying about out of pocket. Keep in mind: We're just looking at what's there 
right now, and not considering what the browser developers may have planned for 
later additions. Also, these are such feature-rich apps that it would be 
impossible to compare every little detail&mdash;which has support for Atom 
feeds or importing OPML, and advanced Java settings, for example&mdash;we'll 
stick to the stuff that's most apparent to regular users. Let's take the 
browsers out for a spin, then, shall we?<i>Continued...</i> <br>
