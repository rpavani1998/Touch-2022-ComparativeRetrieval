<p>Filed Under: Featured, Malware, Privacy, Vulnerability</p> 
<p> A new study has tossed the big browsers into the security mosh pit and 
decreed that Google's Chrome comes in first, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 
pulls in at a close second, and Mozilla Firefox is bleeding a bit like a stuck 
pig.</p> 
<p>The study, released Friday by Accuvant Labs, found that Firefox has four 
&quot;unimplemented or ineffective&quot; security services: sandboxing, plug-in 
security, IT hardening and URL blacklisting (the last of which all three 
browsers flunked).</p> 
<p>The browser comparison found that IE has, in fact, sandboxing and plug-in 
security, but it's just plain old &quot;implemented,&quot; in Accuvant's eyes, 
as opposed to being an &quot;industry standard,&quot; which is the star billing 
Chrome gets for all services (except the aforementioned URL blacklisting).</p> 
<p>Here's Accuvant's conclusion:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The URL blacklisting services offered by all three browsers will stop fewer 
attacks than will go undetected. Both Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet 
Explorer implement state-of-the-art antiexploitation technologies, but Mozilla 
Firefox lags behind without JIT hardening. While both Google Chrome and 
Microsoft Internet Explorer implement the same set of anti-exploitation 
technologies, Google Chrome&rsquo;s plug-in security and sandboxing 
architectures are implemented in a more thorough and comprehensive manner. 
Therefore, we believe Google Chrome is the browser that is most secured against 
attack.</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Accuvant measured anti-exploitation techniques as opposed to the historical 
practice of tabulating vulnerabilities or assessing how speedily they get 
patched. After all, as Accuvant puts it, it's hard to know, exactly, how long a 
browser hole lets the wind in, given that vendors don't necessarily go around 
blabbing about fix timelines:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>While Accuvant LABS did not approach Microsoft for internal statistics on 
privately identified<br>
 vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities with undisclosed 
remediation timelines, it is likely that these statistics exist, and could open 
the door for an unambiguous debate about each project&rsquo;s true response 
time.</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Caveat emptor: Accuvant says the study was independently and objectively 
assessed, but it was, in fact, funded by Google.</p> 
<p>Every browser maker is apt to measure their baby and declare that it's the 
prettiest thing since Shirley Temple.</p> 
<p>Case in point: in Microsoft's own estimation, IE 9 has the best protection 
against phishing attacks and the most protection against socially engineered 
malware of the three most popular browsers.</p> 
<p>Besides, as Sophos's Carole Theriault points out, the real issue isn't 
which browser you use; it's more about whether your browser is up to date and 
how you've configured its security options.</p> 
<p> As Carole said in her Update Your Parents' Browser Day post, people tend 
to stick like glue to the browsers they know and love.</p> 
<p>Confound it to tarnation, they ain't gonna change to some fancy-pants new 
browser. Their old version of fill-in-the-blank works just fine, and they do 
not like change, nosiree.</p> 
<p>And dagnabit, I can't make fun of them because I am one of them: My ears 
got hot when I saw the dissing dished out to my beloved Firefox.</p> 
<p>I switched to Chrome recently not because of security fears but because 
Mozilla's update servers are getting hung up, its image consistently was 
corrupted when I tried to reinstall, and I just didn't have time to 
troubleshoot the whole mess.</p> 
<p>To go back to Carole's point, security can be improved vastly simply by 
keeping a given browser up to date, without rocking the boat on an individual's 
personal preference for browser maker.</p> 
<p>Prejudice toward an outdated version of a given browser, however, is 
inexcusable. Outdated browsers arestill out there, roaming the world at a 
baffling rate.</p> 
<p>IE 6, for example, held 4.63% of worldwide browser usage as of February 
2011. IE is, of course, the whipping boy in this scenario, but with just cause. 
If you look at Security Focus and Secunia'scomparison of unpatched 
vulnerabilities, IE versions 6 through 8 spread unpatched vulnerabilities 
across the table like a nasty rash.</p> 
<p>The upshot: Don't flee from Firefox or IE because of a report like this one.
</p> 
<p>But do flee from old browsers. Stick a fork in them: they're done. </p>

<p>Well yea, of course&mdash;that's why I pointed to Microsoft's own chart 
showing that IE 9 is the most secure of the bunch. You've got to take these 
reports with a grain of salt. And stop right there, commenters who will 
inevitably ask &quot;then why did you bother reporting on the study?&quot; The 
joy of blogging is being able to pick up on one of the headlines of the day and 
throw in a bit of perspective, THAT'S why. Just one of so many joys of the

<p>I've given up using Google Chrome on my iMac (running OS x Lion), because 
it keeps crashing. Reports go off automatically to Apple, but the problem 
remains.<br>
 So I'm using Firefox and Safari (latest versions) again. </p>

<p>Right, for whatever reason, studies of this type tend to stick to the top 3 
browsers. It would be interesting to see Safari and Opera thrown into the mix. 
Gee, I wonder which browser would come out on top if Apple funded a study that 
included Safari.... hmmm..... !</p> Reply <br>

<p>Opera has worst url filtering and has no JIT hardening or sandboxing so it 
would be tied with Firefox. However, from a practical standpoint you are the 
safest b/c no hacker is going to spend his time coding for a 2 percent browser 
in the English speaking web.</p> 
<p>If you were on the Eastern European web, then you would be vulnerable as 
any other browser or more b/c Opera has very respectable market share there.</p>

<p>Excellent critique! And thanks for pointing out that Google's funding of 
the &quot;study&quot; is rather like the makers of Crest toothpaste stating 
that their product has been found to be better than those of other makers or 
that &quot;3-out-of-4 Dentists surveyed&quot; recommend it. A pre-survey is 
always useful in dettermining whom to exclude when the &quot;real survey&quot; 
is taken. I'm always leery of any result obtained from 
&quot;investigations&quot; funded by an interested party but that information 
is frequently hard to ferret out.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Accuvant has got it wrong. Internet Explorer is the least secure browser 
for two fundamental reasons.</p> 
<p>1. It has a larger attack surface especially with ActiveX enabled.<br>
 2. 
It is embedded in the operating system. Therefore a compromise of the browser 
is a potential compromise of the operating system as well.<br>
 This is just 
the way it is. I have raised these concerns with Microsoft in the past and have 
never heard back from them.</p> 
<p>I absolutely agree it is very important to keep up with the latest version, 
one reason I like Chrome is it keeps updating automatically. I'm now on version 
15 and haven't seen any upgrading.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have to agree, it's nice to read headlines about Google fixing a bunch of 
Chrome vulnerabilities and then have the process happen automatically. I just 
miss Firefox because of familiarity, and also because open-source gives me that 
warm populist glow. But then again, with Firefox mostly funded by Google, does 
it actually deserve that warm fuzz? If, in fact, Google keeps funding it... 
last thing I heard, it was a subject about which Mozilla is being a bit terse...

<p>Keeping your software up to date is basic. I know many people don't do it 
for a variety of reasons. Still get contact with people using Apple OS 9. What 
about Apple Safari? How does that hold up in the browser lineup?</p> Reply <br>

<p>I wish my job would see it that way about the old browsers. It's driving us 
nuts. They're stuck on IE 7 (our office did have IE 6 until we complained!) 
because it takes so long to test when a new browser is updated that basically 
an even newer version comes out before they're done. Do they not understand 
that the longer we hang out with the old version, the more vulnerable we are?? 
And they're testing to make sure it's compatible with all the computers? 
Please. There's probably something they aren't telling us. The truth of the 
matter is, the browser is so out-dated, a lot of the stuff we browse barely 
works on them anymore. (Not to mention I can't even get on google +). The place 
I work is a huge Healthcare organization that, when we switch to a new browser, 
would probably get implemented across the country, so they do need to be 
cautious, but not to the point of security vulnerabilities. Personally, I use 
Chrome. Have for about 6 months and will never go back to that bloated and slow 
IE.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Using a NAC to survey our users, I recently discovered that we still have a

<p>This is absolutely a correct statement, and one I'm addressing on Yahoo 
about IE.</p> 
<p>the real issue isn't which browser you use; it's more about whether your 
browser is up to date and how you've configured its security options.</p> 
<p>I am writing articles about every security setting in Internet Explorer, so 
others can be<br>
 safer using it.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I switched back to IE 9 with all of the bells and whistles. I also have 
Paid Versions of Malwarebytes and Avast security. I haven't had anything come 
through that one or the other software's haven't caught and stopped it dead in 
it's tracks. I am always on the vigilant stance as I don't trust anybody or 
anything from the Cloud Crap at all. I use through-away emails from online too. 
I find if something happens to their server I have a new one signed up just as 
soon as I here about a leak!</p> Reply <br>
