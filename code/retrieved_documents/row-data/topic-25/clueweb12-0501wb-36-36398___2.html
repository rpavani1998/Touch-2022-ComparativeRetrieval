<p>With the latest versions of Apple&#146;s Safari and Mozilla&#146;s Firefox 
recently released, it became time for a browser comparison to test whether or 
not improvements in standards and raw speed have made a difference. This is 
especially true given the rapid shift in market share from Internet Explorer's 
one-time dominance: according to Statcounter, Internet Explorer currently 
commands just 61 percent of the browser market, while Firefox has climbed to 
second place with 30 percent market share and the last 9 percent shared between 
Chrome, Opera, Safari and smaller rivals.<br>
<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
 In the 
spirit of full disclosure and honest journalism, we should disclose that our 
primary browser on a daily basis is Firefox. Personal usage habits aside, this 
review will serve as a comprehensive and objective survey of the current 
browsing landscape. All of our testing was conducted on anotebook connected to 
a Wi-Fi network to simulate real world usage. The laptop is a Dell Latitude 
D630 with 2GB of RAM, a Core Duo processor and Windows XP. The tests were not 
pursued in a lab environment, but should be representative of what an end user 
would expect. Our review of these four popular browsers began with fresh 
installs and updates of each one. All testing was done under actual usage 
scenarios with other applications running in the background. Each test also 
began with a fresh browser restart.<br>
<br>
 Chrome 2 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Firefox 3.5<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Internet Explorer 8 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Safari 
4<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>industry compliance testing</strong> <br>
<br>
 Our first test is from The Web Standards Project (webstandards.org) which is 
the home of the Acid2 and Acid3 browser tests. These tests verify that browsers 
are compliant with major web standards including W3C, HTML 4.0, XML 1.0, XHTML 
1.1, and DOM and ECMA standards. Acid2 is designed to expose browsers and 
applications that inaccurately render simpler web content, particularly tests 
for W3C HTML and CSS compliance that should be common on the web. All four 
browsers passed the Acid2 test with no issues, errors, or delays, though it was 
originally launched in 2005 and has been used as a target for accuracy even by 
Microsoft, which until recent years had not felt compelled to fully support W3C.
<br> <br>
 Acid3, however, was a 2008 update to Acid2 and was considerably more 
of a challenge for our four contestants. It builds upon Acid2 and stresses 
compliance with the DOM (document object model) and JavaScript, the latter of 
which is crucial to most modern web apps like Google Docs. Earning a 100/100 on 
the Acid3 test means a browser has loaded and completed 100 sub-tasks and 
successfully changed the graphic colors with each subtask. Safari 4 was the 
only browser to fully complete this test and earned a 100/100 score -- a not 
surprising result given the efforts of the WebKit team to target the Acid tests 
as a goal. Firefox came close at 93/100; Chrome, which also uses a modern 
WebKit engine, matched Apple at 100/100 but unusually produced an error stating 
that the &quot;linktest failed.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Internet Explorer failed the 
test spectacularly. The first time IE ran Acid3, it stated that it needed to 
run an add-on called MSXML 3.0 and it made it to 12/100 with some random 
graphical errors. Upon allowing the add-on to load and re-running the test it 
progressed to 20/100, but still failed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Even though 
Firefox didn&#146;t make it to 100 and Chrome had failed the 
&#145;linktest,&#146; these browsers at least seemed to run the test in the 
same amount of time as Safari. We don&#146;t think it would be fair to say that 
Firefox and Chrome are vastly inferior to Safari in their rendering 
capabilities; they simply don&#146;t adhere to the standards as closely as 
Safari does. If we were to give report cards as a result of the test, Safari 
would earn the top mark of an A+ while Chrome and Firefox would each receive an 
A. Internet Explorer, though, clearly earned an F.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>speed testing with JavaScript</strong> <br>
<br>
 Many major web 
properties rely on JavaScript to accurately render the user environment. 
Because of its prevalence in modern web-browsing, our speed tests focused on 
the browsers' ability to quickly render JavaScript code.<br>
<br>
 Our first 
JavaScript performance test is from dromaeo.com. Dromaeo is a Mozilla project 
and, in theory, might favor Firefox. Dromaeo offers several sets of tests and 
we opted for the full range, which takes over a half hour to run. The results 
for this test are expressed in the number of test runs per second, so the 
higher the score the better.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Once again, 
Internet Explorer couldn&#146;t run the full set of tests and in this case kept 
locking up on a &quot;base64&quot; sub-test. We tried running smaller sets of 
tests, but each batch resulted in at least one error that prevented Internet 
Explorer from completing the run. Other browsers completed the tests, but the 
gaps were wide: Firefox appropriately edged out Chrome by about 30 points, but 
Safari took the crown and more than doubled Firefox&#146;s score. This can 
largely be pinned on Safari's Nitro engine, which is touted as better optimized 
than Chrome's and also has the advantage of the fairly lean WebKit rendering 
engine to back it up.<br>
<br>
 Our second JavaScript speed test was 
webkit.org's SunSpider suite of tests. WebKit is the rendering engine for 
Safari, so as with Dromaeo and Firefox we expected a slant towards Chrome and 
Safari. The score results of this test are generated with a statistical 
variance of plus or minus a few percent. We ran the tests several times and 
used the score that came with lowest variance. The score is expressed in 
milliseconds, so lower scores are better.<br>
<br>
 It's interesting to note 
the Internet Explorer generated the most consistent sample of scores at 1.5 
percent variance or less and Chrome and Safari generated the most scattered 
scores, at around 4 percent variance. Firefox, Safari, and Chrome all came in 
at around 2,000 milliseconds, but Chrome just barely claimed the win while 
Internet Explorer took over 8,000 milliseconds to finish. As seen with Dromaeo 
and Firefox, there was no home field advantage for Safari.<br>
<br>
 Our third 
test was Google's own V8 JavaScript rendering test. Google of course uses the 
V8 JavaScript engine in Chrome, so we anticipated a slanted result here as 
well. The V8 test uses a complicated formula to calculate the scores, but the 
larger the score the better.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Chrome did in 
fact win this test, but Safari took a close second. Surprisingly, Firefox was 
in a distant third place, and the results for Internet Explorer barely 
registered. Internet Explorer really dragged in these tests: several times 
during the tests, an error box popped up asking to stop running them as they 
were making the application run slowly. We can honestly say we&#146;ve never 
seen a software application all but beg to stop a test.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 Our final JavaScript test was provided by a third party known only as 
CelticKane. Again, the results are measured in milliseconds, so the lower the 
score the better. Again, Internet Explorer took last place while Safari led the 
pack. Chrome and Firefox produced very similar results but reached second and 
third places respectively.<br>
<br>
<strong>testing summary</strong> <br>
<br>
 
Disappointingly for those who'd expected a clear leader, the final results were 
a draw; Chrome and Safari both won two sets of tests. Firefox was perpetually 
middling and came in third place in half of the tests while reaching second 
place the other half, never completely winning any one test. What left little 
mystery was Internet Explorer's habitual lack of performance. It consistently 
came in last place for each of the tests and was by far the worst performing 
browser in the Acid3 test.<br>
<br>
<strong>personal usage thoughts</strong> 
<br> <br>
 While not the champion, the new Firefox 3.5 is still noticeably 
faster in daily browsing than the previous 3.1 edition. It also still has the 
largest development community of all of the browsers available today and its 
add-on architecture is not only flexible but results in top notch 
contributions. Despite coming in third in our speed tests, it's responsive for 
day to day use and is quite stable, which couldn't always be said for earlier 
versions and other modern browsers.<br>
<br>
 Internet Explorer may still have 
the largest share of the browser market, but after these tests we're wondering 
why. There are no redeeming qualities to the software's performance or ability 
to draw websites, and it's bad enough that we would recommend any other browser 
over Internet Explorer unless it's absolutely required. Just as in the tests, 
IE is tangibly slower in common use and sometimes creates problems with viewing 
sites as they were intended.<br>
<br>
 Chrome and Safari shared the top spot 
for a reason: they consistently took top ranks in our speed tests and are both 
a pleasure to use. They may have garnered less than 5 percent of the global 
browser market, but they're both excellent browsers that deserve more. Either 
is very lightweight and has an extremely simple user interface that gets out of 
the way when possible. If you haven&#146;t tried one of these browsers before, 
we would highly recommend giving one or both of them a go for a solid week -- 
though Mac users will likely have already spent their fair share of time with 
Apple's software, which can't be said for Windows users and Chrome.<br>
<br>

<strong>wrapping up</strong> <br>
<br>
 Between the Acid and JavaScript testing 
and our real world usage tests, we can say without a doubt that we would 
recommend virtually any of these browsers other than Internet Explorer. We 
didn&#146;t design this article to bash against Microsoft, but their product 
truly is second class compared to the competition. Firefox is great for those 
that love add-ons, and Chrome and Safari are both very high-speed but also 
low-frills.<br>
