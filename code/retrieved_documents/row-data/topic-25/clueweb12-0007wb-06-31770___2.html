<h2>To access Oncourse, which web browser should I use?</h2> 
<p>Most features in Oncourse work with most popular modern browsers. Oncourse 
is regularly tested with Internet Explorer (Windows) and Firefox (Windows and 
Mac OS X), and the Oncourse team tries to ensure there are no serious 
browser-specific bugs with these applications. UITS therefore suggests using 
Internet Explorer or Firefox for the most reliable experience with Oncourse.</p>
<p>UITS also recommends using the most up-to-date version of your preferred 
browser. Current versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer are available to 
Indiana University students, faculty, and staff viaIUware. Note that new 
incompatibilities may be introduced when a new browser version is released; 
developers will work to address serious compatibility problems as quickly as 
possible.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To determine which browser version you're running, 
on a Windows computer, click<strong><code>Help</code></strong>, and then click 
<strong><code>About Internet Explorer</code></strong> or <strong><code>About 
Mozilla Firefox</code></strong>. On a Mac, from the <strong><code>Firefox</code>
</strong> or <strong><code>Safari</code></strong> menu, select <strong><code>
About Mozilla Firefox</code></strong> or <strong><code>About Safari</code>
</strong>. </p> 
<p>Some people have reported better performance with one browser than with 
another; if your browser's performance is not adequate, try the same task in 
another browser. For example, if you're having difficulties accessing a link 
using Firefox, close your browser, log into Oncourse from Internet Explorer, 
and try to open the link again. If you continue to have difficulties, contact 
your campusSupport Center. During business hours, faculty can also get help 
from theteaching and learning centers.</p> 
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>With the exception of Safari in iOS5, most mobile browsers for wireless 
phones and tablets do not support creating and editing content in theWYSIWYG 
editor. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>In Internet Explorer 8, if some pages are not displaying correctly, you 
may be able to resolve the problem by turning on Compatibility View. In 
Internet Explorer, click<strong><code>Tools</code></strong> and then <strong>
<code>Compatibility View</code></strong>. For more, see Microsoft's Some Web 
sites may not behave as expected in Internet Explorer. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>You may get unexpected results if you use two browser windows to access 
the same Oncourse tool at the same time. For best results, use one browser 
window to work in Oncourse.<br>
