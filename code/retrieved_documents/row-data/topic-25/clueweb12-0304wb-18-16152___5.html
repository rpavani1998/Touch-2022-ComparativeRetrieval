<h1>Which Browser is Best? Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome?</h1> 
Posted on May 5, 2011  by admin <br>
<br>

<p>Internet Explorer, Firefox &amp; Google Chrome</p> 
<p>[poll id=&quot;3&quot;]</p> 
<h3>Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome?</h3> 
<p>There are literally dozens of browsers that we could discuss, but these 3 
consistently rank in the top 3 most used (with the exception of Safari), with 
Opera sitting at number 4 but not even producing numbers worth discussing.</p> 
<h3>Internet Explorer</h3> 
<p>Internet Explorer used to dominate the world wide web as the only browser 
even worth considering to use, with about 90% of users using it as their 
primary browser. And then came Firefox. Firefox quickly took off becoming the 
second most used browser on the market, and it succeeded in capturing some of 
the dedicated Internet Explorer users. Firefox is now the primary browser for 
approximately 26% of computer users.</p> 
<p>Internet Explorer&rsquo;s biggest failures are its security risks and how 
slow it functions.</p> 
<p>It has also become a recent pain for developers, as it follows its own sets 
of rules in how it displays divs, tables, icons, images, links, header tags, 
and more. It used to have the freedom to dictate these things, but soon it will 
need to realize that the market is growing, and it can no longer operate under 
the same old code that it has always offered.</p> 
<h3>Firefox</h3> 
<p>Firefox&rsquo;s success has shined by offering it as an open-source 
browser. Open-source simply means that it is driven by a large community of 
people, in which nearly anyone can develop tools, plug-ins or add-ons that can 
be downloaded and used in Firefox. Firefox was also the first browser to offer 
tabbing, instead of having to open new windows, which often led to a messy task 
bar.</p> 
<p>One of Firefox&rsquo;s biggest benefits is the add-ons and plug-ins that it 
offers. The spectrum of tools offered range in everything from web developer 
and design tools, to shopping and coupon tools, to entertainment tools. The 
list goes on for everything, and if you can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re 
looking for now, chances are that it will be developed in the near future.</p> 
<p>Firefox is much faster than IE, but a bit slower than Google Chrome.</p> 
<h3>And Then Came Google Chrome</h3> 
<p>Google Chrome is the moderate in-between, which is now used by 
approximately 13% of users. It does not offer as many add-ons or plug-ins as 
Firefox, but it makes up for the missing tools with speed. Google Chrome is by 
far the fastest browser around, and it&rsquo;s URL field double as a search 
engine tool. A very nice addition.</p> 
<p>Both Google Chrome and Firefox display web pages and special functionality 
similarly.</p> 
<p>Google Chrome&rsquo;s only downfall is that some special features and 
custom web applications may not yet be compatible with Chrome.</p> 
<h3>So, Which Browser is the Best One?</h3> 
<p>I cannot name a &ldquo;best&rdquo; internet browser because both Firefox 
and Google Chrome have their benefits, with very little negative aspects 
surrounding them. I can however tell you that IE is quickly turning into an 
antique browser. It&rsquo;s slow, has too many bugs, and refuses to work in 
harmony with other search engines.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re not big on add-ons, then Google Chrome the best internet 
browser for you. It&rsquo;s extremely fast, and offers some great search tools 
built into the platform.</p> 
<p>If you want flexibility in regards to add-ons and plug-ins, then Firefox 
will be your browser of choice. There is a countless number of features that 
can be very beneficial for developers, designers.</p> 
<p>Internet Explorer is really only good for a few things, one of which is 
pulling up old, out-dated websites that are only compatible on IE. The other is 
for compatibility testing, which really isn&rsquo;t a benefit, just a necessary 
use.</p> 
<h3>Facebook Browser &amp; Search Engine</h3> 
<p>With Mark Zucky basically taking over the world one Facebook user at a 
time, I suspect that he will be launching either a new Facebook browser or 
Facebook search engine one day. He has the marketing platforms in place, along 
with the technology vehicles to move users over from other browsers and search 
engines.</p> Tweet <br>
