<h1>Which Browser Should You Use?</h1> 
<h2>Not all Web browsers are created equal. Some are faster; some are more 
versatile; others are especially secure. We tested six leading browsers to 
learn where each one excels&hellip;and fails.</h2> 
<p> By Megan Geuss, PCWorld &nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Illustration by Papercut.frEveryone needs a Web browser, but with so many 
different ones available, deciding which one is best for you can be hard. Are 
you looking for something blazing fast? Or is strong security your top 
priority? Or do you need lots and lots of add-ons?</p> 
<p>We examined the latest versions of six widely used desktop and laptop 
browsers--Chrome 17, Firefox 10, Internet Explorer 9, Opera 11.61, RockMelt 
0.9, and Safari 5.1.2--paying special attention to such variables as speed, 
safety, extra features, and extensions. (To download any of these six browsers, 
visit our handydownloads page. For our appraisals of five popular mobile 
browsers for the Android operating system--Chrome for Android Beta, Dolphin 
Browser HD, Firefox for Android, Opera Mini, and Opera Mobile--see &quot;The 
Best Browsers for Your Android Phone.&quot; And for advice on how to get the 
most from your laptop/desktop version of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or 
Safari, see &quot;21 Ways to Buff Up Your Browser.&quot;) Among the PC browser 
contenders, Google's Chrome version 17 narrowly captured the crown as the top 
performer overall in our tests, thanks to speedy Java&shy;Script rendering and 
page load times, excellent security tools, and a respectable array of add-ons 
and features. Mozilla's Firefox 10 finished a close second, processing HTML 5 
graphics faster than any other browser and sporting a huge library of add-ons 
to make browsing easier and more fun.</p> 
<p>RockMelt 0.9, the browser built on Google's Chromium framework that comes 
integrated with Facebook, was the surprise third-place finisher. We had 
expected the browser's Facebook integration and social-reading sidebar to slow 
its performance; but in our hands-on testing, RockMelt worked faster than most 
of its rivals, and it permits you to share links and chat with friends on 
Facebook without having to go directly to the social network.</p> 
<p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 earned a rather low score for its features: 
It doesn't offer themes for your browser, and you can't sync favorites unless 
you use Windows Live Mesh. Nevertheless, it offers more security options than 
most competing browsers, and it processed HTML 5 code quickly.</p> 
<p>Opera 11.61 distinguished itself from its rivals with blazing page-load 
speeds and a great mobile browser, but it came up short in HTML 5 processing.
</p> 
<p>Safari 5.1.2 didn't perform especially well on any of our benchmarks; its 
only noteworthy redeeming quality, particularly for Windows users, is the solid 
security it provides.<br>
While reading our assessments, bear in mind that 
every browser behaves differently depending on the hardware setup, the Internet 
connection, and the modifications you make to your browser (with add-ons, the 
amount of space allotted for cache, and the like).</p> 
<h2>Google Chrome 17</h2> 
<p>Overall Best</p> 
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> <br>
&bull; Lets you close slow or frozen pages 
without restarting the browser<br>
&bull; Sandboxed design helps prevent 
malware infections<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> <br>
&bull; No integrated RSS 
reader<br>
&bull; Plain design</p> 
<p>Add-ons for Chrome 17 include popular mobile games.Chrome wins our top spot 
thanks to its ease of use, numerous extensions and add-ons, and superb 
performance. It may not be perfect for everyone, but Chrome is a well-rounded 
browser that should meet most people's needs.</p> 
<p>Chrome's minimalist design isn't eye-catching, but its lean toolbar leaves 
more room for viewing Web pages. And what Chrome lacks in flashiness, it 
certainly makes up for in performance. Google's browser really shone in our 
JavaScript test, far outdistancing its competitors. Many popular 
websites--including Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube--use JavaScript 
because it makes those sites more immediately responsive, and JavaScript-heavy 
pages behave better in Chrome. The browser also performed admirably in our 
speed test, fully loading an image-heavy page in just under 4 seconds. This 
lighting-fast speed comes from a feature new to Chrome 17 (released in early 
February) that lets the browser start loading the URL you type in the address 
bar be&shy;&shy;fore you press.</p> 
<p>To complement its im&shy;&shy;pressive performance, Goo&shy;gle's browser 
has some worthy features that others lack. For starters, Chrome runs tabs as 
separate processes--so if one of them crashes, the entire browser doesn't go 
down with it. If your online wanderings take you to a foreign-language website, 
Chrome will recognize the language and offer to translate it for you in a 
matter of seconds. The translations, powered by Google Translate, aren't 
exceptionally accurate, but they can at least give you a basic idea of what the 
page is about. Chrome is also one of the most secure browsers on this list, 
because it is sandboxed: The plug-ins that Chrome uses access information only 
within the browser itself and can't read information from other areas on your 
computer. Sandboxing prevents malware that uses plug-in exploits from spreading 
via Chrome through your PC.</p> 
<p>Owners of smartphones or tablets running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) 
will appreciate the ability to sync their Chrome bookmarks and Web history to 
those mobile devices.</p> 
<p>You can customize Chrome with Web apps, themes, and extensions to suit your 
preferences. Chrome's built-in Web store simplifies searching for and 
installing browser add-ons. The add-ons range from simple (an Evernote plug-in, 
for example), to complex (such as full versions of Angry Birds and Bastion). 
And unlike with Firefox, you don't need to restart your browser every time you 
install a new extension or app.</p> 
<p>On the downside, Chrome lacks an integrated RSS reader, which means that 
you'll have to come up with your own approach to handling multiple RSS feeds if 
you subscribe to more than one.</p>
