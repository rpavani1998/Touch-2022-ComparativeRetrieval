<h2> Firefox lessons for the Java world </h2> <br>
<br>

<p>A long time ago Internet Explorer had a competitor. However over the past 
few years, it has been IE all the way. Netscape&rsquo;s share dropped sharply 
and although Opera is a very good browser it never became a serious&nbsp;IE 
competitor. Mozilla Firefox hopes to compete with the IE giant and win!&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Firefox browser is growing at a rapid pace and is consistently pulling 
market share from IE. Check this report:&nbsp; Internet Explorer Losing Market 
Share</p> 
<p>IndicThreads.com has already got requests from 9 different versions of 
Firefox. About 8% of all hits are coming from Firefox.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The community support for Firefox is exceptional. Obscure sites are 
flashing Spread Firefox banners and blogs across sections have only good things 
to say about Firefox. To know how you can support Firefox, check&nbsp;
SpreadFireFox.com.</p> 
<p>To download Firefox follow this link &gt;&gt; </p> 
<p>On noticing this widespread Firefox support across the open source 
community, my initial reaction was &quot;Ok. Almost everybody who loves open 
source hates Microsoft and so Firefox is just serving as a medium to get back 
at Microsoft. Supporting Firefox just seems to be the cool thing to 
do&quot;.&nbsp;I did not really believe that Firefox was so good that it could 
kill IE.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was a little slow to check out Firefox. But once I got 
it going, I was really impressed. Firefox has all that you need. Like the Java 
IDE platforms Eclipse and NetBeans, Firefox also has this concept of 
extensions. Checkhttps://update.mozilla.org/extensions/.&nbsp;This means that 
new functionality will get added at a pace that Microsoft cannot match. Firefox 
is fast, the interface is clean and actually I can&rsquo;t think of any 
significant negatives. Unlike many open source s/w, the installation is also 
very simple. What more can&nbsp;you ask for?</p> 
<p>I have converted. I still use IE and Opera but Firefox is now my preferred 
browser. I feel a little sorry for Opera because if Opera had become totally 
free (no ads) and had the community support that Firefox is getting today it 
could have been as big as Firefox long time back. Opera is an awesome browser 
(if only the free version was ad free) and I hope it becomes completely free 
very soon. Anyway, who is going to buy Opera if they have a free open source 
and cross platform alternative to IE.</p> 
<p>After my good experience with Firefox, I&nbsp;also tried out ThunderBird 
and SunBird.http://www.mozilla.org/products/. ThunderBird is a mail client 
while Sunbird is a calendar application. Outlook Express and Outlook better 
watch out. Sunbird is still in an&nbsp;experimental stage but once it get ready 
for production and integrates well with ThunderBird, SunBird and ThunderBird 
together should be a super combination that can not only match Outlook Express 
but also give Outlook a run for its money.</p> 
<p>So what does this mean for the Java developer community? Browser 
compatibility is of course a bigger concern now as your app will have to work 
at least on IE, Netscape and FireFox. But not just that because it also shows 
the Java community that it is possible to compete with Microsoft even without a 
big company name behind the product or a big marketing budget. The users have 
to relate with the product and promote it as if it was their own creation. 
Linux already did that in the OS space and Firefox is now doing it in the 
browser space.</p> 
<p>Its true that Java has survived and competed well with Microsoft for many 
years now but for it to continue to thrive and compete, it also needs to learn 
from success stories like the FireFox one. Can Java do a FireFox and grab even 
more market share from Microsoft in the application development space?</p> 
<p>&gt;&gt; Get Firefox! </p>

<p>Before firefox I was using the heavyweigt Mozilla and I have a hang of it. 
Some of the features Mozilla has are capturing HTML form data and re-fill from 
the memory, a user friendly Password manager and a very effective popup blocker 
for the nasty popups. Firefox has virtually taken all the goods of Mozilla and 
re-architechured its look and feel very close to IE to address a larger 
user-base. So firefox is all set for some fireworks now:)</p> </li>

<p>Just download an extension for mouse gestures, then:</p>

</p>

<p>Without a doubt the single most useful feature of Opera for me is mouse 
gestures. Until Firefox supports Opera like mouse gestures I&rsquo;m not moving.

<p>Wait for a few days before you download Firefox. Firefox 1.0 releases on 
the 9th of Nov!</p> </li> </ul>
