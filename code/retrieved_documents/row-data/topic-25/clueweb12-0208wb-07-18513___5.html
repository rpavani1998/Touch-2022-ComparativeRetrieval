<h1>NSS Labs: Internet Explorer 9 Offers Best Protection </h1>

<p>According to statistics from Trend Micro, at present 53 percent of malware 
attacks come directly from the Internet, compared with just 12 percent via 
e-mail. Many of those Internet-based attacks involve social engineering, 
tricking users into initiating or permitting a malicious download. In 
recognition of the prevalence of this threat, vector modernbrowsers include 
built-in filters to protect users. NSS Labs put six browsers to the test using 
real-world threats and found thatInternet Explorer 9 beta offers vastly more 
protection than the rest.</p> 
<p>In 11 days of 24/7 testing, NSS Labs identified over 8,000 potential 
threats, whittled that list down to about 1,200 confirmed threats, and further 
culled the list to about 600 to ensure a representative mix. Internet Explorer 
8 blocked an impressive 90 percent of the threats, an even better showing than 
in theprevious run of this test earlier in 2010. </p> 
<p>Internet Explorer 9 achieved an outstanding 99 percent blocking rate, 5 
percent of which was accomplished by the browser's new application reputation 
system. Roger Capriotti, group product manager for Internet Explorer, explained 
this technology. &quot;Ninety percent of downloads involve a small set of files 
with established reputations,&quot; said Capriotti. &quot;The remaining 10 
percent is super interesting. Naturally it includes all the malware. In fact, 
25 to 30 percent of these unknowns are later identified as malware. And fully 
50 percent of them are new every day.&quot; The application reputation system 
identifies risky unknown downloads and advises the user to delete them.</p> 
<p>Symantec's Norton Insight feature has a similar function. Put simply, it 
identifies files that are not known to Symantec, that are very new, and that 
are very uncommon as dangerous. However, Rick Moy, president of NSS Labs, said 
that his tests haven't shown Symantec's technology to be as effective.</p> 
<p>Microsoft's Capriotti said this built-in protection against malicious sites 
is just one component of the coming Internet Explorer 9 experience. &quot;We're 
very focused on the best browsing experience for billions of Windows 
customers,&quot; said Capriotti. &quot;For Internet Explorer 9 beta we've built 
a fast browser with hardware acceleration We completely rewrote the Javascript 
engine so it's the fastest. And we offer a new, clean streamlined user 
interface, with a more interactive and immersive experience.&quot;</p> 
<p>The other browsers in the test, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, scored 
much lower than Internet Explorer. They also uniformly scored lower than their 
own performance in the previous round of testing. Firefox detected 19 percent 
of the threats, down from 29 percent. Safari detected 11 percent and Chrome 
detected 6 percent. Opera turned in a perfect zero; it did not detect any of 
the socially engineered malware samples.</p> 
<p>The same technology that blocks malware sites also protects against 
fraudulent (phishing) sites.PCMag's antiphishing testing uses Internet Explorer 
as a touchstone. Surprisingly, the majority of third-party antiphishing 
products can't do better than the browser's built-in protection. In past years 
we also used Firefox for comparison, but its phishing detection rate declined 
to the point where it was no longer useful. Jeb Haber, principal program 
manager lead for Internet Explorer security, did point out that the number of 
malware-hosting sites is vastly greater than the number of active phishing 
sites.</p> 
<p>Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all rely on Google's Safe Browsing service to 
identify malicious sites. Curiously, NSS Labs found that despite using the same 
service, the three products had significantly different overall detection 
rates. Safari in particular had trouble communicating with the service, which 
partially explains the differences. For full details on the results of this 
test visit theNSS Labs web site.</p> <br>
