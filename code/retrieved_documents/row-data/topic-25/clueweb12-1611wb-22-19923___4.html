<h3>Stop Using Internet Explorer!</h3> 
<p>I have written several times about the high risks of using Microsoft's 
Internet Explorer web browser. The security problems just keep coming and 
coming. If you were surfing the web last Friday night or Saturday morning and 
you were using Internet Explorer, there is a chance that your Windows computer 
became infected with an Internet &quot;worm.&quot; This happened even if you 
did not directly visit an infected site.</p> 
<p>It seems a hacker managed to load malicious code onto a web server that 
delivers advertising directly to users who visit other web sites. If you 
browsed with Internet Explorer to an infected site, the code then placed a worm 
inside your copy of Internet Explorer. The worm allows hackers to take control 
of the infected PC and steal personal data from your system.</p> 
<p>While the site you knowingly visited may not have been infected directly, 
that site may have delivered advertisements to you from a third-party server. 
The infected server passed on the infection to your copy of Internet Explorer, 
even though you never saw its URL in your web browser's address bar. The 
recommendation is that everyone update their virus definitions from the 
software vendor's web site and then scan for viruses immediately. In addition, 
Windows XP users should install Windows XP Service Pack 2, if possible. Anyone 
running Windows 98, ME, or 2000 has no recourse for closing the known computer 
security holes; Microsoft has not issued a fix for those systems.</p> 
<p>Before those of us with Windows XP get over-confident, we need to remember 
that Microsoft Service Packs are designed to fix specific, known problems. 
However, they do not address the underlying security weaknesses that continue 
to let hackers find other ways into home computers. And the primary avenue for 
these hackers is Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p> 
<p>I have a better idea: dump Internet Explorer. It is weak, slow, and riddled 
with security problems. Every few weeks a new exploit appears that takes 
advantage of Internet Explorer's weaknesses. This past weekend's exploit was 
Internet Explorer-specific: it did not infect other web browsers.</p> 
<p>There are better, faster, and more secure web browsers available. Some good 
ones are even free of charge. My favorite is Firefox, available for Windows, 
Macintosh, and Linux. It is fast, it is secure, and it is free of charge. It 
also has many more features than Internet Explorer. You can obtain Firefox at 
no charge athttp://www.mozilla.org. Another good one for Windows is Opera, 
available athttp://www.opera.com. </p> 
<p>You do not need to uninstall Internet Explorer; simply stop using it.&nbsp; 
As some of you may know, downloading updates from Microsoft's web site - 
including Windows XP Service Pack 2 - requires Internet Explorer. This would 
appear to be a &quot;Catch-22.&quot; However, if you stick to the one task of 
downloading needed Microsoft updates and do not leave the Microsoft web site, 
you should be able to complete the necessary download with minimal security 
risk.</p> 
<p>For everything else, use a better tool instead. You can read my earlier 
review of Firefox at
http://eogn.typepad.com/eastmans_online_genealogy/2004/11/a_better_web_br.html. 
Note that a number of readers of this newsletter posted their comments at the 
end of the article, describing their experiences with Firefox.</p> 
<p>You can read more about this past weekend's problems with Internet Explorer 
at the highly-acclaimed Information Week magazine site at
http://informationweek.securitypipeline.com/news/53701328, on eWeek's site at 
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1730877,00.asp, on ZDNet's site at 
http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-5462862.html, on PC World's site at 
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118687,00.asp and and probably 
hundreds of other sites if you look at Google at

.</p> 
<p>Which web browser would you prefer to use? </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>NOTE: This newsletter's web site at www.eogn.com does not serve ads from 
any third-party server and therefore would not cause the specific problem that 
affected other servers this past weekend.</p> </blockquote>
