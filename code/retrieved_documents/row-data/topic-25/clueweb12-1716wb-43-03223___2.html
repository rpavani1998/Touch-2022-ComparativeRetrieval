<h2>Power Balance is rubbish</h2>  I've been coming across Power Balance 
bracelets more and more often. These bracelets use a special hologram (or 
sometimes&nbsp;quantum&nbsp;effects) to &quot;restore your body&rsquo;s 
electrical balance, promoting a free exchange of positive and negative ions and 
align your body&rsquo;s energy pathways.&quot; They instantly provide:

<h2>Why you shouldn&rsquo;t use Internet Explorer</h2>

<p>The history of web browsers is actually quite interesting. Back in the 
distant past the two big players were Microsoft Internet Explorer andNetscape 
Navigator. Microsoft won that particular battle in the late 90&prime;s by 
bundling IE with Windows. Effectively most people came to think of the internet 
as IE.</p> 
<p>After destroying the competition Microsoft simply stopped developing IE and 
we were stuck with the pile of trash that is Internet Explorer 6.</p> 
<p>Luckily today we have excellent alternatives, most notably in Firefox and 
(my recommendation)&nbsp;Google Chrome.&nbsp;Faced with competition and 
plummeting market share Microsoft are now desperately trying to catch up. But 
they are still miles behind.</p> 
<p>A Firefox developer recently released a comparison of Firefox with the 
newest version of Internet Explorer, IE9 which is due to be released later this 
year. The comparison shows that even the upcoming IE9 is way behind Firefox in 
terms of features.</p> 
<p>Google Chrome is even better than Firefox! It is faster, more stable, and 
has more features.</p> 
<p>Despite all this, too many people still use Internet Explorer! You can do 
better. The internet can be faster, easier and safer so easily.</p>
