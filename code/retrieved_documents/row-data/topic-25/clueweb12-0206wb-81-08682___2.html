<h2>  Which is the Best Browser For a Web Designer? </h2> <br>
<br>
 What is 
the best browser for a casual web surfer? Which should you choose for online 
banking? What browsers should you consider when you make your own website? Read 
on to find out.
<p>A web designer might be asked &quot;Which browser do you think is 
best?&quot; He would reply with a question...&quot;What do you want it 
for?&quot; Website designers should never use fewer than the three main 
browsers - Firefox, IE, and Opera. Let's get back to what you want for surfing 
the Internet, then I'll cover whatweb designers&quot;&gt;web designers want.</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>Opera and Firefox are much more secure than IE. Over 80% of viruses are 
made to be sent using Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>With Firefox you'll get strict anti-phishing and anti-malaware security. 
You may know them as spyware. They have easy ways to recognize the bad guys 
with their new one-click site ID info. Their open source policy gives them 
thousands of security experts around the world planning how to keep you (and 
your personal information) safe.</p>
<p>What does &quot;open source&quot; mean? These are people whose reward is to 
keep coming up with better answers than their (friendly) rivals. Employees and 
trade unionists tend to be more interested in doing as little work for as much 
pay as possible.</p>
<p><b>User friendliness</b></p>
<p>Discussion can get quite heated because it is a matter of opinion. One user 
commented &quot;The best browser is whatever we do with IE! These other 
wannabes are just a blip on the screen!&quot;</p>
<p>Myself...I prefer Firefox, and I particularly like their process for 
downloading software. I like their way of asking me where to locate the 
downloaded file, and showing me the download progress.</p>
<p>I like the Firefox add-on to download embedded videos. That's quicker 
when&nbsp; I want to save videos to my computer, but it doesn't work with 
you-tube videos. It only downloads the down-loader which is no help, so I have 
to use IE.</p>
<p>With IE I can download any video. First I delete the history, then 
&quot;view&quot; a video while I read some of my library book, then come back 
and look in the history files. The biggest file will be the right file, so I 
copy it and paste it wherever I want it on my computer, then I delete the 
history files again.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, that would be too much trouble if IE was my default browser. But I 
mostly use IE when Firefox refuses to display web pages that are designed so 
that they will only work on IE, and to download videos.</p>
<p>Firefox is unquestionably best for add-on features. Some of these features 
would only interest a web site builder. For instance, as a web site builder, I 
like to use the site code validator add-on. Browse through their add-on list 
and pick out the ones that you will find most useful.</p>
<p><b>Web Designers</b></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, website designers&quot;&gt;website designers should 
have at least the top three browsers installed on their computers. When I was 
making my latest site that teaches beginners how to make their own website, I 
spent about a six days working through it with another website designer trying 
to make the site look the same whichever browser visitors used.</p>
<p>At first, IE showed my right hand column first, then the left hand column 
appeared at the bottom of the page. Graphics were sticking out to the right of 
the columns. Everything was a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>The other web site builder persuaded me to give up on making my website 
look good for visitors with their screen resolution set to 800 pixels wide, 
because fewer and fewer visitors still use such a low resolution.</p>
<p>Once the template was defined in pixels we were able to specify widths in 
pixels instead of in percentages. The other website designer suggested that IE 
would cause problems with my font sizes being specified in points, so I changed 
them all to pixels.</p>
<p>All this time I kept changing back and forwards between Opera, IE, and 
Firefox. At last my website displays the same way in all three browsers for 
browsers using any screen resolution higher than 800 pixels.</p>
<p>To sum up, if you just surf the Internet, try out some browsers to see 
which you think is the best web browser for you. If you are a web designer, you 
must have several browsers, without worrying about which is best.</p> <br>
