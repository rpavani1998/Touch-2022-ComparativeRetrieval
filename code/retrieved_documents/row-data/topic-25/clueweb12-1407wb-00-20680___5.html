<h3>The New Bing Looks Very Promising</h3> Tuesday, March 8th, 2011 
<p>After watching the demo video on the new Bing coupled with IE9, my first 
thoughts were&hellip; &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; My next thoughts were &ldquo;Does 
Google have anything coming to rival this?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The new Bing will roll out with IE9. Bing has some interesting 
enhancements, they are clearly rolling-up their sleeves in their goal of 
cutting into Google&rsquo;s search market share. Some of the new enhancements 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>HTML-5 Powered</li> 
<li>Instant Search</li> 
<li>Transitions</li> 
<li>Smarter Quick Tabs</li> 
<li>Interactive Homepage</li> 
<li>Expanding Links</li> </ul> 
<h4>Interactive homepage</h4> 
<p>Bing has already changed things up a bit by adding background images to 
their homepage. They are taking this idea several steps further. If you have 
HTML-5 enabled, you can view full-motion video backgrounds as well as zoom in 
and out on static images. The video background loads quickly and doesn&rsquo;t 
require any special plugins.</p> 
<h4>Screen transitions</h4> 
<p>The new Bing reminds me of how you interact with smart phones, where 
screens slide smoothly and the transition is clean and automated as opposed to 
how pages change currently.</p> 
<h4>Instant Search</h4> 
<p>Google released their instant search last September, Bing&rsquo;s really is 
no different in the &ldquo;search previews as you type.&rdquo; This update kind 
of gets lost with the other enhancements, but still helps improve their user 
experience.</p> 
<h4>Quick tabs</h4> 
<p>There will be quick tabs near the top of your browser just below the search 
box. These will be relevant to your search, so in the demo video below, when 
you Bing &ldquo;San Francisco&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll be presented with quick tabs 
such as weather, flights, news, maps, web etc. These tabs and the search bar 
will be fixed at the top of the screen, even when scrolling down on the results 
page. The related searches on the left stay as well. This makes sense keeping 
this information and functionality handy so you don&rsquo;t have to scroll up 
or down on the page to access it again after scrolling. The transitions between 
tabs are smooth and slide left and right so you don&rsquo;t really feel like 
you&rsquo;re leaving the page you are on.</p> 
<h4>Expanding links</h4> 
<p>Now that netbooks and handheld devices are gaining in popularity, the 
screen size for many is smaller. To&nbsp;accommodate this, Bing will display 
only links at the bottom of the search results pages. Once you begin to scroll 
down, the descriptions/captions will expand (accordion out). This frees up an 
other wise limited screen real estate.</p> 
<p>Most of these enhancements come from visitor behavior research. 
They&rsquo;ve been paying attention to what people do and how they interact and 
took this information to better enhance the user experience. There is more 
coming, but so far it looks great!</p>

<h3>Come on Bing &ndash; That is Not Very Nice</h3> Thursday, December 9th, 
2010 
<p>So I was logging into Bing local and was brought to a screeching halt. 
Looks like they don&rsquo;t support the Google Chrome browser&hellip; Wonder 
why?</p>

<h3>Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer Browser Falls Below 50% of Worldwide 
Market for First Time</h3> Tuesday, October 5th, 2010 
<p>Finally!!! IE is dying off. If you know any designers, then you know that 
there is a real hate towards IE, and to be honest, for good reason. If you just 
step back and try Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome, then no doubt you will 
choose Firefox or Chrome. They are simply better browsers. Firefox has a big 
following but Chrome is growing in popularity at a rapid rate.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t just take my word for it, read the press release from 
StatCounter:</p> 
<p>BOSTON &amp; DUBLIN&ndash;(BUSINESS WIRE)&ndash;Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet 
Explorer (IE) browser has fallen below 50% of the worldwide market for the 
first time according to StatCounter. The company&rsquo;s research arm, 
StatCounter Global Stats finds that Microsoft IE fell to 49.87% in September 
followed by Firefox with 31.5%. Google&rsquo;s Chrome continues to increase 
market share at an impressive rate and has more than tripled from 3.69% in 
September 2009 to 11.54% in September this year.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Just two years ago IE dominated the worldwide market with 67%.&rdquo;
<br> &ldquo;This is certainly a milestone in the Internet browser wars,&rdquo; 
commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. &ldquo;Just two years ago IE 
dominated the worldwide market with 67%.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>He added that Microsoft&rsquo;s agreement with European Commission 
competition authorities to offer EU users a choice and menu of browsers from 
March may have tipped IE below 50% globally.</p> 
<p>In Europe, IE market share has fallen to 40.26% in September this year from 
46.44% in September last year. In North America IE is still above 50% at 52.3% 
followed by Firefox at 27.21% and Chrome at 9.87%.</p> 
<p>The rise of Google Chrome in North America has also been impressive and in 
June it overtook Safari for the first time.</p> 
<p>StatCounter Global Stats are based on aggregate data collected by 
StatCounter on a sample exceeding 15 billion page views per month collected 
from across the StatCounter network of more than 3 million websites. 
StatCounter, which provides free website traffic information, publishes browser 
stats in its StatCounter Global Stats, a free online research tool. It also 
monitors Internet market share battles including Search Engines, Social Media 
and Operating Systems including mobile.</p>
