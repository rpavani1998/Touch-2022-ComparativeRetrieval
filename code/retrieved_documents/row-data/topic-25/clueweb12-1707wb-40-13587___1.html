<h1>Explorer or Firefox? Which One Is Better?</h1> 
<p>The answer to the question of whether to choose Explorer or Firefox is 
probably ambiguous and you may have to do a bit of research to find out which 
one works for you. This conversation is more difficult with the emergence of 
Google Chrome, another popular web browser available for free. For those still 
new to the web, a browser such as Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox 
and Google Chrome are simply software programs for locating and displaying 
content found on the Internet. At first, each of these programs may appear the 
same, but there are differences, particularly in the categories of security and 
compatibility.</p> 
<p>First, the issue of security. When Mozilla Firefox was released, interest 
was focused on how it was not integrated into Windows and therefore offered 
more security for your operating system from malware. Today, Firefox continues 
to offer every available tool it can to protect your computer including 
security upgrades with every new version. This isn&rsquo;t altogether different 
from the other browsers but the company boasts that as its highest selling 
point. All three browsers try to attract users by stating their high 
performance and thousands of ways to personalize the browser. Whichever one you 
choose, regardless of the high level of security provided by Firefox or the 
others, remember to also add anti-virus software to your computer.</p> 
<p>The most important part of choosing your web browser is to know its 
compatibility with the functions you want it to provide. Although many websites 
are now upgraded to function with any web browser, not all of them do. For 
instance, your bank or some other website where you need to enter data 
personally, may function on only one browser or another. Compatibility may 
decide for you which browser you will use for a certain website. Some people 
require multiple browser to access various information on the Internet that 
they access.</p> <br>
