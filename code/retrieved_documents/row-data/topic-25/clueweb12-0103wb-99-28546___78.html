Mastering Microsoft Word can make you 
a more productive and creative teacher. You'll learn how to create, open, edit, 
and save documents, as well as how to create tabs, margins, and spacing. Then 
you'll make your classroom documents come to life. You'll add borders, clip 
art, and WordArt. You'll even insert shapes, pictures, tables, and complete a 
host of other exciting tasks that you can teach your students. As you get more 
familiar with this program, you'll find that it enhances your teaching in ways 
you didn't think possible, and you'll have a host of ideas for 
curriculum-related classroom projects. As we walk through our virtual tour of 
Microsoft Word, you'll encounter a lot of program features you may not have 
known about--features that enable you to control document presentation, stay 
organized, and keep your students inspired and excited. You'll even produce 
templates that you can use for classroom tests, create a classroom poster, and 
use Word's table tools to create a class grade roster.  This course is vital 
for today's teachers who have to produce and achieve so much in so little time. 
Join us and find out how to turn this dynamic program into a launching pad for 
creative lesson plans and engaging classroom activities. <b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>

<p> <b> Classroom, Practical Ideas for the Adult ESL/EFL</b><br>
Learn ESL 
teaching strategies that will set your adult ESL/EFL students up for success! 
Over the next six weeks, you'll discover ways to teach ESL that create a 
meaningful and positive learning environment for your students. You'll get to 
know what motivates them and how you can tailor your ESL teaching methods to 
their needs. We'll look at the key role that planning plays, because when your 
students know what to expect, they'll respond positively&#151;and you'll teach 
with more confidence. You'll gather a wealth of principles for how to choose 
truly effective activities for such skills as listening, speaking, reading, 
writing, grammar, and pronunciation. Along the way, you'll pick up practical 
ways to incorporate both traditional and alternative forms of assessment into 
your classroom teaching. And finally, we'll spend some time talking about how 
you can become a more reflective teacher and continue to grow both 
professionally and personally. By the end of this course, you'll be teaching 
ESL in a way that helps your students move skillfully from the classroom to the 
real world! Course materials are developed by Heinle I Cengage Learning, a 
global leader in ESL/EFL materials. Course content is approved by the TESOL

<p> <b> Classroom, Spanish</b><br>
If you're struggling to communicate with 
your Spanish-speaking students and their families, and you don't know your<i>
cabeza</i> from your <i>codo</i> (that's your head from your elbow), don't 
worry&#151;help is here! Whether you took a Spanish class 20 years ago and just 
want to brush up a bit, or you have never taken a Spanish class, you'll learn 
the essential Spanish for teachers and bridge the communication gap with your 
Spanish-speaking students and parents. Rest assured that this won't be anything 
like your typical high school Spanish course. We'll skip the frills and focus 
on &quot;survival Spanish&quot; you can put to work immediately. We've tossed 
out long vocabulary lists and complex grammar rules and replaced them with 
games and stories to make learning easy, painless, and even fun. You'll learn 
new words in easy-to-digest bites, and each lesson will include Supplementary 
Material to help you keep expanding your vocabulary. We'll start with the 
basics of Spanish pronunciation, and then we'll move right into simple words 
for everyday things, such as colors, numbers, and question words. Then you'll 
learn more of the basics of conversational phrases, family names, and 
directions. Next, we'll get into what it's like on the first day of school as 
we go over words related to enrolling new students, conversing in the 
classroom, talking about rules and behavior, and basic vocabulary for various 
academic subjects. We'll also cover Spanish words and phrases to use in the 
cafeteria, on the playground, and even in the nurses office! Finally, we'll 
delve into some survival phrases for the parent-teacher conference as you learn 
to describe how a child is doing, talk about academic or behavior problems, and 
discuss grades and homework. By the end of this course, you'll be well on the 
path to being a Spanish speaker and communicating more effectively with the 
Spanish-speakers all around you. &iexcl;Vamos! (Let's go!) <b>REQUIREMENTS: </b>

In 
this professional development course for teachers, you'll get the training you 
need to reach the diverse mix of students you face every day&#151;learning 
proven strategies that turn diversity into opportunity. With a mix of students 
who have learning disabilities, neurobiological disorders, and physical 
challenges, the modern classroom requires an efficient and effective teacher 
who can prioritize under tight deadlines and be creative on demand. Over the 
next six weeks, you'll learn how to be the kind of super teacher who can guide 
every student toward academic success. And do you know what the best part is? 
You don't have to tear your hair out in order to adapt each lesson so that it

students with special needs became a part of the mainstream. Then we'll discuss 
the inclusive classroom as a home for these students, exploring how all our 
kids can benefit from an adaptive learning environment. We'll examine how each 
child learns and what you can do to help him or her develop new strengths. 
You'll gain a deeper understanding about building collaborative partnerships 
with the special educator and classroom aides. Over the course of 12 lessons, 
you'll discover creative, low-budget strategies for turning your inclusive 
classroom into a nurturing, supportive learning environment that helps every

<p><b>  Differentiated Instruction &amp; Response to Intervention Connection
</b><br>
 Today&#146;s teachers are using two powerful 
approaches&#151;Differentiated Instruction (DI) and Response to Intervention 
(RTI)&#151;to help every child succeed academically. In this course, 
you&#146;ll learn how to put this &#147;dynamic duo&#148; to work in your own 
classroom teaching and lesson plans. You&#146;ll start by exploring different 
learning styles and delving into a concept called<i>multiple intelligences</i>. 
In addition, you&#146;ll look at the factors that motivate students to learn in 
a child-centered classroom. After that, you&#146;ll master the basics of both 
DI and RTI and learn how these two approaches work hand-in-hand to enhance 
children&#146;s learning. You&#146;ll find out how to perform different types 
of assessments, monitor your students&#146; progress, select research-based 
teaching materials, address learners&#146; diverse needs, and move students up 
or down the RTI tiers so they&#146;re getting just the right help they need. In 
addition, you&#146;ll find out why collaboration is crucial when you&#146;re 
implementing RTI and DI. You&#146;ll discover how you and your colleagues will 
work together as a team to identify at-risk students, plan solutions, and 
address problems quickly and efficiently. And finally, you&#146;ll learn how to 
get parents involved as active partners in the education process. Case studies 
and examples will help you see how DI and RTI strategies work in the real 
world, and you&#146;ll get lots of ideas for hands-on activities you can start 
using right away in your own classroom. Throughout this course, you&#146;ll 
have opportunities to practice new techniques and exchange ideas with fellow 
educators and your instructor. You&#146;ll come away armed with powerful and 
easy-to-implement strategies that will benefit every student you teach.<b><br>

<p><b>Differentiated Instruction in the Classroom</b><br>
Differentiated 
instruction (DI) is becoming a mainstay in classrooms across the country as 
educators are starting to see the ways that the traditional classroom setting 
limits their ability to reach diverse learners. Join us on this journey through 
10 practical DI integration strategies! Count on at least three sample 
integration lessons on each strategy, and just think of all the ways that you 
can apply them to improve learning outcomes for your students. Over the next 
six weeks, we'll talk about DI strategies ranging from multiple intelligences 
(MI) to flexible grouping, cubing, WebQuests, I-Searches, tiering, anchoring 
activities, and interest centers. Every lesson is packed with real-world 
examples that will help you put these strategies to use in your own classroom. 
We'll take a look at integration across different subjects, grade levels, and 
learning profiles as you gain helpful tips on bringing DI to your classroom. 
This course is a must for today's teachers who often have to differentiate 
quickly, and with a minimum of resources. DI is an excellent launch pad for 
ramping up your creative classroom, and with the tips in these lessons, you'll 
be reaching your diverse learners in no time flat. <b><br>

<p><b> GED Test Preparation</b><br>
 Technological advances in the workplace 
have made a high school diploma essential for almost all workers. If you want 
to obtain employment or advance in your career, you will need to demonstrate to 
you employer that you have at least a high school education. If you never 
finished high school, the GED exam will serve as proof that you have acquired 
the equivalent of a high school education on your own. If you are comfortable 
reading newspapers and you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide without a 
calculator, you're halfway there! This course will help you develop the 
additional reading and thinking skills you'll need to succeed in all five GED 
test areas: Writing Skills, Social Studies, Science, Literature, and Math.

Around 30% of students in sixth grade already have trouble with basic 
reading and writing. These literacy problems affect performance across subject 
areas, and they often leave teachers wondering how to help. Get the 
professional development training you need to improve student literacy as an 
accomplished teacher shares the secrets of turning guided reading strategies 
into opportunities for teaching writing. The road to literacy is also the road 
to ingenuity, invention, and imagination, and you'll soon learn how to take

about how calculators work, and then you'll discover how best to get a handle 
on your income and expenses. You'll be able to check your paystub, invoices, 
and bank statements for errors and overcharges, and you'll become more skilled 
at handling money and comparing investment opportunities. You'll learn how to 
calculate percentages, including the proper amount to pay in tips, commissions, 
taxes, and discounts. You'll find out how to calculate interest rates and 
you'll develop a better understanding of mortgages, credit cards, and other 
types of loans. You'll discover a handy method for converting one type of 
measurement to another, and you'll be able to calculate areas correctly so you 
don't overspend on your next home improvement project. You'll become adept at 
interpreting graphs, calculating the probability that something will (or won't) 
happen, and understanding the statistics embedded in test results, polls, and 
even news stories. <b> REQUIREMENTS: </b>  A basic calculator with the ability

students, basic math is a struggle. But for students and teachers in Singapore, 
math is much more intuitive. And Singaporean students have been top mathematics 
performers for over a decade! Using a layered curriculum founded on solid 
number sense and concrete, pictorial, and abstract computational strategies, 
Singaporean teachers make math purposeful, interesting, and relevant. Soon 
you'll learn their secrets and be able to have the same kind of meaningful math 
lessons in your classroom. In this teacher training course, you'll learn over 
two dozen strategies to make math click for your students. We'll begin by 
exploring what Singapore Math is and how it has become such a powerful and 
highly regarded math curriculum. Then we'll talk about how number sense and 
place value instruction are the basis for all Singapore Math. From there, we'll 
learn a variety of computational strategies to make addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division a cinch. You won't need a passport to discover the 
curriculum of the world's math leader! <b><br>

<p> <b> Math, Singapore Strategies: Model Drawing for Grades 1-6</b><br>
In 
this professional development course for teachers, you'll get the training you 
need to start teaching model drawing, the powerful Singapore Math strategy that 
gives word problems a visual context. As a teacher, you know that many students 
groan when it's time to solve word problems. Why is that? Are the problems too 
difficult? Do students get lost trying to decipher the wording or figure out 
the computation? Do they simply not know which strategy to use? Actually, it's 
a combination of all these issues. Luckily, model drawing, a Singapore Math 
strategy for working word problems, will help your students start to enjoy math 
in a way they may never have before. The secret behind model drawing is that it 
gives students a concrete, reliable set of seven steps that they can use to 
solve 80% of the word problems out there. They won't have to memorize 20 
different techniques and know when to use which anymore. Instead, they'll learn 
how to read the problem, determine its variables, draw a unit bar (the visual 
model), adjust that bar, place the question mark to indicate what they're 
solving for, do the computation, and write a complete sentence at the end. Does 
it sound too good to be true? This six-week course will prove to you just how 
effective model drawing can be in your classroom! <b><br>

<p> <b> Reading Strategies That Work, Response to Intervention</b><br>
 
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could be proactive in helping our struggling 
readers? Well, we can! In this six-week course, you'll learn response to 
intervention (RTI) strategies that ensure the struggling readers in your 
classroom get the help and education they need. RTI is research based and gives 
us a strategic plan to bring tiered interventions to our students, at their 
reading level and with their unique challenges in mind. Helping them with 
phonics, fluency, vocabulary mastery, comprehension, and writing, these 
intervention strategies tackle the toughest literacy problems with flexibility 
and creativity. During our time together, you'll discover tools like Elkonin 
Boxes, alphabetic arcs, Bloom's Taxonomy, and new and exciting graphic 
organizers. Whether you're working with struggling readers in kindergarten or 
12th grade, you'll find that these strategies work with a full 80% of students, 
without the need for special pull-outs or extra IEP intervention. Why? Because 
RTI gets to the root of the problem&#151;quickly! If you're eager to learn the 
right ways to help your struggling readers make steady progress throughout the 
year, you'll find that this course gives you the power to teach flexibly and 
creatively, without the need for extra training in literacy or fluency. As an 
added bonus, there's nothing quite like helping students discover the pleasures 
of reading! <b>REQUIREMENTS:</b> Internet access; e-mail; and the Microsoft

<p><b> SAT/ACT Preparation - Part 1 </b> <br>
Making the decision to attend 
college is probably one of the most important decisions you&#146;ll ever make, 
and your performance on college entrance exams is instrumental in determining 
your college choice. Universities and colleges throughout the U.S. require 
applicants to take the SAT or ACT as part of their evaluation package. This 
course will prepare you for both tests. Both the ACT and the SAT contain verbal 
and math question types. SAT/ACT Preparation Part 2 will give you all the 
information you need to do well on the math questions of the ACT and the SAT. 
The ACT math tests your knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, 
trigonometry, and basic statistics. This course provides you with a complete 
math review of all these subjects. We&#145;ll also show you how to use your 
time wisely so that you finish as many math questions as possible in the 60 
minutes the ACT gives you for the math test. Beginning with the March 2005 
exam, the SAT math questions have changed a bit. They eliminated the 
quantitative comparison questions and added questions on functions and graphing 
functions. The lessons in this course are designed to prepare you for those 
changes. In addition to reviewing arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and basic 
statistics, we'll cover functions and other algebra II subjects now tested on 
the SAT. In addition to preparing you for specific question types on both 
exams, this course will give you pointers on time management, anxiety relief, 
scoring, and general standardized test-taking. Weekly assignments encourage you 
to work with your fellow classmates and your instructor to maximize your 
performance on all aspects of the math questions of the ACT and SAT. Taken with 
Part 1, this course will prepare you to excel in all sections of the 
undergraduate college entrance exams and provide you with the means to achieve 
your best potential score!  &nbsp;<b>REQUIREMENTS: </b> The Official SAT Study

<p><b>Teaching ESL/EFL Grammar</b><br>
In this course, you'll come to see 
English grammar as a three-dimensional process that's useful in bringing 
coherence, cohesion, and texture to writing and speech. We'll begin by 
considering seven definitions of grammar that we'll draw on throughout the 
course. We'll also discuss the differences between patterns and rules, and why 
second-language learners benefit from our instruction on both. You'll learn why 
students need to understand the three dimensions of grammar&#151;form, meaning, 
and use&#151;and how seeing grammar as a dynamic and changing system helps 
students overcome many of their grammar challenges. You'll also see why 
teaching grammar in a way that makes it personally meaningful to your students 
brings the best results. And since teaching isn't just about presenting 
lessons, we'll also go over the importance of &quot;reading&quot; your 
students&#151;observing them to try to figure out what learning process they're 
using. We'll contrast rote or mechanical practice with meaningful practice, and 
we'll go over guidelines for creating activities and adapting your textbook 
exercises to get students working on the unique learning challenge presented by 
each different grammatical structure. Toward the end of the course, we'll talk 
about what specific errors students make can indicate, and how they can help us 
pinpoint the unique challenges our students face so we can develop meaningful 
practice activities to help them meet those challenges. And we'll finish up the 
course by discussing ways that you can give valuable feedback to your students.

enjoyable for your students! <b>REQUIREMENTS: </b> Internet access, e-mail, the

the most important skills you can teach? The skill of reading not only gives 
your students what they need to be successful learners, but it also makes them 
more self-confident and eager to learn their whole life long. It's truly at the 
core of the other language skills&#151;listening, speaking, writing, and 
grammar. In this course, you'll learn how to show your students the value of 
reading to motivate them to become strong readers. Together, we'll explore the 
core skills of intensive reading. Then we'll examine extensive reading and how 
to integrate it into your curriculum. Next, we'll cover ways to bring 
vocabulary teaching into your reading classroom. You'll find out the difference 
between<i>teaching</i> comprehension and merely testing on it. They're not the 
same! We'll also look at ways to help your students develop a fluent reading 
rate and use strategies for reading successfully. And we'll round out our time 
together by discussing how to plan effective lessons, design a strong reading 
curriculum, select appropriate reading materials, and assess students to 
encourage their growth. If you would like to pass a passion for reading on to 
your students, then this is the course for you!<b><br>

<p><b>Teaching ESL/EFL Vocabulary</b><br>
Do you sometimes wonder if the 
vocabulary your textbook is teaching is really what your ESL students need to 
learn? Well, you're not alone. Many teachers long to have a more precise and 
effective ways of helping their students learn English vocabulary, and in this 
course, I'll show you how. Over the next six weeks, you'll discover what the 
different types of vocabulary are, as well as how to accurately assess what 
your students already know and what they need to learn. You'll also explore the 
most powerful way of teaching vocabulary as you teach ESL: across the four 
strands. These four strands include meaning-focused input (listening and 
reading), meaning-focused output (speaking and writing), language-focused 
(deliberate) learning, and fluency development. You may be surprised to learn 
that you don't need to devote class time to all the types of vocabulary. 
Instead, you're better off teaching your students learning strategies with 
certain categories, and you'll get to fully delve into what these are too. In 
addition, you'll find ways to evaluate how successful your vocabulary 
activities are, see how to teach vocabulary with content-based instruction, and 
explore how to monitor your students' learning. By the end of this course, 
you'll understand what makes a well-balanced vocabulary course and how to 
design one of your own! <b>REQUIREMENTS: </b>  Internet access, e-mail, the

<p><b>Teaching Students with Autism: Strategies for Success</b><br>
Just 20 
years ago, we didn't see students with autism in our classrooms. But today, we 
teach children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's Syndrome right 
alongside their neurotypical peers. Reaching and teaching these students 
requires a delicate balancing act: understanding how their brains are wired, 
helping them turn challenges into opportunities, and learning to enjoy the rich 
perspective they bring to the classroom. If you've ever had a student who 
blurted out in class, screamed when someone patted his or her shoulder, or 
rocked back and forth in the chair, you'll appreciate the lessons ahead. We'll 
discover the neurobiology behind these disorders and the way it affects 
students' behavior, learning, and thinking. Most important, you'll learn 
creative, easy, low-budget strategies to help these kids succeed in the 
classroom and beyond. Develop the skills to counter these students' social 
awkwardness, sensory sensitivities, meltdowns, problems with homework 
completion, language reciprocity issues, and violent fixations. Even if you 
don't have a student with high-functioning autism or Asperger's Syndrome in 
your class this year, these strategies will equip you to deal with any student 
who exhibits these characteristics on a regular basis. <b> REQUIREMENTS:</b>
