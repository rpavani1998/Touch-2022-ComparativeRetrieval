<h1>Internet Explorer is not the only Web Browser: Tip of the Day</h1> Posted 
on October 13, 2010 by Daniel <br>

<h3>Better Browsing</h3> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Windows user and you&rsquo;re still using Internet 
Explorer (as about 53% of users are), here&rsquo;s a quick way to improve your 
productivity, profit, and pleasure in using the Internet.</p> 
<p>Change your browser. There are a number of fine browsers out there, but the 
outstanding choices are Firefox and Chrome. It&rsquo;s quick and easy to 
download and try a new browser. You can easily import your bookmarks, too. You 
can run as many browsers on your PC as you want, and you can uninstall them if 
you don&rsquo;t find them suitable for your purposes.</p> 
<p>As more and more of our computer time is spent online and using online 
applications, more and more of our time is spent in a browser. Try some new 
ones and see how they work for you.</p> 
<h3>Firefox 3.6.9</h3> 
<p>Firefox is an open source browser from the Mozilla Foundation. It is the 
second most popular browser, with about 30% of the market. Rock solid, easy to 
use, dependable. Much better security than IE is one attraction of Firefox. The 
other is the tremendous collection of add-ons that Firefox users can install 
&ndash; most for free, which add functionality ranging from blocking ads to 
managing bookmarks to great tools like Shareaholic (which makes it easy to 
share web pages to Facebook, Twitter or any of hundreds of places on the web 
where you might want to share content).</p> 
<p>The only downside to Firefox is that if you load it up with add-ons (which 
you will and should) it tends to get slow.</p> 
<p>Download Firefox from Mozilla</p> 
<h3>Chrome 7.0.517.41 beta</h3> 
<p>Chrome is a newer browser from Google. It also has a great collection of 
extensions (like Firefox add-ons) to add functionality to the browser. 
It&rsquo;s also very secure and it has a pleasant, uncluttered user interface. 
The big attraction is speed. It opens faster than other browsers and will amaze 
you if you&rsquo;re still using Internet Explorer.</p> 
<p>Download Chrome from Google</p> 
<h3>Other Browsers</h3> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t count out Microsoft, though. Internet Explorer 9 is out in beta 
and getting good reviews. Other credible choices are Safari (the Apple browser) 
and Opera.</p>
