<h1>Firefox vs. Internet Explorer</h1>  Posted in:

<li>Industry News</li> 
<li>Web Browsers</li> </ul> <br>

<p>When it comes to web browsers, Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer has 
enjoyed many years of near dominance. In fact, the current statistics report 
that nearly three-quarters of web surfers use Internet Explorer. But things are 
rapidly changing. Although Internet Explorer still remains the most popular 
browser, usage has steadily decreased since 2002, when 95% of internet users 
used the browser.</p> 
<p>So what is the reason for the steady decline in usage? Mozilla Firefox. In 
only a few years, Firefox has become the second most popular browser, used by 
almost 1 in 5 web surfers.</p> 
<p>In this article, we discuss how Internet Explorer has maintained such great 
popularity among web surfers, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of 
using Firefox as an alternative browser.</p> 
<h2>Why Is Internet Explorer Popular?</h2> 
<p>Internet Explorer is popular because it is the default browser that comes 
pre-installed on Windows operating systems. (Windows is a Microsoft product, 
and most computers run the Windows operating system.)</p> 
<p>Additionally, many websites &mdash; including Microsoft&rsquo;s website 
which delivers product updates &mdash; require visitors to have Internet 
Explorer in order to use the advanced applications and applets. Clearly, 
Microsoft has been very clever to ensure that its web browser will continue to 
outperform others in terms of use.</p> 
<h2>What Can Firefox Offer You?</h2> 
<p>As for Firefox, it has become popular over time due to its speed, features, 
and plethora of optional add-on extensions. Some standard features include a 
spell checker, download manager, customizable skins, and live bookmarking. 
Firefox also has an extension repository featuring a wide variety of add-ons 
that can be submitted by third party developers and downloaded by the general 
public.</p> 
<p>But one of the most celebrated features is security. Unlike Internet 
Explorer, Firefox developers regularly address vulnerabilities and release 
patches when necessary.On the other hand, Internet Explorer is not known for 
security. Instead, its flaws and loop holes are regularly exploited, making 
your computer easy prey for malicious websites and hackers.</p> 
<p>The graph at left shows the increasing popularity of Firefox (red line). 
The green line shows the increasing popularity of Safari, most likely due to 
the increased popularity of MacOS on which Safari is the default browser. (<i>

<h2>So, Which Should You Choose?</h2> 
<p>Your choice of browsers depends on which operating system your computer 
runs:</p> 
<p>Mac Users</p> 
<p>Definitely opt for Firefox. If that is not your cup of tea, be sure to try 
out other popular browsers such as Apple Safari or Opera.</p> 
<p>Windows Users</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, for Windows users, you do not have the luxury of choosing 
one browser over the other. You will need both. Firefox, for example, would be 
the predominant browser, allowing you countless features and unparalleled 
security. And Internet Explorer would be simply used for obtaining Microsoft 
updates.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And so, the battle between the browsers rages on. Will Firefox be able to 
dominate web space? Probably not. As long as Microsoft Windows remains the 
preferred operating system, Internet Explorer will continue to be a predominant 
browser.</p> 
<p>Even more interesting, with every version of Internet Explorer the 
differences between the two browsers lessen. Who knows, in a year or two, we 
might be advocating everyone to jump on the Internet Explorer bandwagon!</p>
