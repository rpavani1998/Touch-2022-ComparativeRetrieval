<h1>Internet Explorer, standards and customer value</h1> By Eric Larkin | 
Posted inArena, Innovation, Business Strategy <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> It&rsquo;s been a satisfying couple of months for the Arena product team. 
We went live with the Summer &rsquo;11 release of our core application. We 
launched several new applications includingArena PartSaver, Arena PDXViewer and 
Arena Drop Box. And finally, we stopped supporting version 6 of Internet 
Explorer (IE6).</p> 
<p> If you have friends who work on web software, you&rsquo;re probably 
familiar with the frustrations of supporting IE6&mdash;and if this is a new 
topic to you, justrun a search for &ldquo;IE bugs&rdquo; to see how problematic 
this particular piece of software has become. With a long history of subpar 
code and non-compliance with web standards, IE6 has inspired a whole class of 
&ldquo;cross-browser&rdquo; frameworks, designed to hide the many hacks and 
workarounds that IE6 requires to work with modern web applications.</p> 
<p> As we at Arena embark on the next phase of product development, the 
limitations of IE6 have been top of mind. As we seek to develop fast, 
light-weight and modern web applications for manufacturers (while continuing to 
enhance and improve our core application, of course) we must confront a 
long-standing but still hotly debated topic in the world of SaaS 
providers&mdash;whether to support Internet Explorer at all.</p> 
<h2> Wasted resources reduce customer value</h2> 
<p> Supporting Internet Explorer with our new apps might seem like an obvious 
decision, since IE remains the dominant browser for many manufacturing 
companies. Well-built software meets requirements, and it&rsquo;s easy to argue 
that since our market uses Internet Explorer, support for it is an obvious 
requirement.</p> 
<p> But, as CTO of Arena Solutions, a big part of my job is to make sure we 
create as much customer value as possible with the available resources&mdash;in 
this capacity, I think of myself as an agent for our customers. Arena provides 
resources, and I use my best judgment to allocate them. Not only must I ensure 
the security and availability of our core application, I must also develop, 
deliver and maintain as many new and useful products and features as I can.</p> 
<p> When I think about it this way, I have to question if supporting Internet 
Explorer with our new apps is the best choice.</p> 
<p> For example, to make a new feature in our core application work with IE6, 
we must code the feature using standard HTML, CSS and Javascript, and then find 
and fix all the places where seemingly correct code is corrupted by IE6 
bugs&mdash;unfortunately, the &ldquo;fix&rdquo; is often to remove or 
compromise functionality. It&rsquo;s not an overstatement to say that 
supporting IE6 roughly doubles our workload, leaving fewer resources available 
to develop new features and improvements for our customers.</p> 
<p> IE7, IE8 and IE9 are better than IE6, but they still have a lot of issues. 
To make matters worse, Microsoft has announced that IE8 is the last version of 
Internet Explorer they will release on Windows XP, so even as new versions of 
IE are released, a large portion of users will be stuck using version 8. And 
since IE8 has many of the same kinds of problems that IE6 had (the common web 
wisdom is thatIE8 is the new IE6) Arena will once again be spending valuable 
resources to make products that work with a non-compliant and outdated browser.
</p> 
<p> Or will we?</p> 
<h2> The case for abandoning Internet Explorer</h2> 
<p> Today, there are not one, but three very compatible browsers that 
implement web standards and compete on the basis of meeting those 
standards&mdash;Safari, Chrome and Firefox. All three of these browsers are 
free, easy to install, easy to write code for and are increasingly raising the 
bar for performance and standards compliance. Google has even created a free 
way to give IE itself an alternative &ldquo;personality&rdquo; with 
dramatically better standards compliance in the form ofChrome Frame.</p> 
<p> The competition between browsers to support web standards is a Good Thing, 
because the standards themselves are moving forward at an increasingly rapid 
clip. Most notably, HTML5 and CSS3 have opened up a whole new world of 
applications just waiting to be written. And while it is still true today that 
the majority of our users come to Arena using Internet Explorer, we see more 
and more willingness to try something new in exchange for improved 
functionality and performance.</p> 
<p> For our new applications, I envision a future in which we <strong>
don&rsquo;t</strong> have to do more work and accept a degraded user experience 
just to support the &ldquo;stock&rdquo;, non-Chrome-Frame-enhanced 
configuration of Internet Explorer. Even though it is the most commonly used 
web browser for our audience, the case for designing outside its confines is 
growing more compelling by the day.</p> 
<p> To put it another way, it is clear to me that Arena can create a great 
deal of customer value with new applications built around the latest web 
standards, but it is not clear if the value of supporting IE will outweigh the 
cost in engineering efficiency and forgone features.</p> 
<h2> Meeting current needs versus preparing for the future</h2> 
<p> The growing acceptance of browsers like Firefox and Chrome and the rapid 
advance of web standards is ushering in a new era of online applications. Are 
these applications doomed to fail commercially if they don&rsquo;t work 
&ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; with Internet Explorer?</p> 
<p> This is a difficult question for any company to answer, but it is 
particularly difficult for Arena because manufacturing has historically used IE 
more than other markets. Until recently, we had to accept the bugs, weak 
standards compliance and functional limitations IE imposed because so many of 
our customers relied on it. There&rsquo;s no question that our core application 
will continue to support stock IE, but when we create new applications and 
features, should we look to what we have always done or look to the future?</p> 
<p> Our customers are forward-thinking&mdash;and so are we&mdash;so I tend to 
believe that companies like Arena should lead rather than follow the market, 
especially when it allows us to create more value with the resources we have.
</p> 
<h2> It&rsquo;s always a good idea to stand back and check your assumptions
</h2> 
<p> Support for Internet Explorer has been the subject of many late-night 
conversations within our product team, but it&rsquo;s very clear that 
we&rsquo;re not the only ones wrestling with this problem. Younger 
&ldquo;cloud&rdquo; companies are making the decision every day to abandon 
Internet Explorer. The more cutting-edge and willing the customer base is to 
adopt SaaS solutions and other technologies, the more appealing it is to 
improve engineering efficiencies by abandoning stock Internet Explorer. Since 
Arena is the only SaaS organization that serves manufacturing exclusively, we 
need to consider our audience before making a decision.</p> 
<p> So what do you think? Is the manufacturing audience receptive to products 
that don&rsquo;t support IE? Should we embrace the most modern, 
standards-compliant options and deliver new products as quickly and efficiently 
as possible? Or is it better to continue to support the browser most commonly 
used by our audience, even if it prevents or substantially delays the launch of 
applications like the Arena Drop Box and PDXViewer&mdash;both of which are 
built around theHTML5 File API, a standard implemented by Firefox, Safari, and 
Chrome but not Internet Explorer?</p>
