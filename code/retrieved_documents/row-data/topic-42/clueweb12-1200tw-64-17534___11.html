<h1>WOT Would You Pick: 2013 Chevy Traverse or 2013 GMC Acadia?</h1>

<p><strong></strong>With a new and improved 2013 Chevy Traverse and 2013 GMC 
Acadia on the horizon, families will, without a doubt, cross-shop the two 
platform mates. Pricing for the updated models hasn&rsquo;t been released, but 
the current Acadia should cost a few grand more than the Traverse, depending on 
trim and drivetrain. Assuming the price gap will carry over for 2013, here is 
what your extra hard-earned money will get, should you opt for the Acadia over 
the Traverse.</p> 
<p>First the similarities. Both get the same 3.6-liter, direct-injection V-6 
engine rated at 288 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque (or 281 hp, 266 lb-ft with 
single exhaust on the Chevy). Power is sent to the front or all wheels via a 
revised six-speed automatic. They both offer three rows of seats for seven or 
eight passengers with a long list of optional niceties such as leather seating 
surfaces, heated and ventilated front seats, a rear DVD entertainment system, 
and an infotainment system that integrates smartphones. Passengers are equally 
as safe in either crossover, thanks to a new center airbag, a rearview backup 
camera, and standard curtain airbags.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s what sets the two apart. Those who prefer a more solid and 
boxy look will prefer the GMC and its bold front fascia. TheAcadia&rsquo;s 
optional Denali package ups the tough look with 20-inch rims, fender flares, 
and lower body cladding. The Denali treatment also carries through inside with 
aluminum accents and exclusive Cocoa Dune-colored leather seats, not available 
on the Traverse. The Acadia also gets standard LED daytime running lamps not on 
the Chevy. The base model Traverse rides on 17-inch steelies, while the Acadia 
comes standard with 18-inch alloys.</p> 
<p>The Chevy Traverse is also a bit heavier, based on GM&rsquo;s spec sheets, 
with a curb weight of 4713 and 4956 pounds (front- and all-wheel-drive models, 
respectively), compared to the Acadia&rsquo;s 4646 and 4840 pounds. The Acadia 
is officially rated to tow up to 5000 pounds, but the Traverse can handle 200 
more pounds, GM specs show. The EPA rates the Acadia passenger volume at 154 
cubic feet, which is four more than the Traverse. Finally, twofeatures not 
available of the outgoing Chevy Traverse is the optionalTechnology Package, 
which includes HID lights and a head-up display.</p> 
<p>With that said, do you care about the GMC&rsquo;s extra stuff enough to 
pick it over the 2013 Chevy Traverse?</p>

<p>Neither the Traverse nor the Acadia holds a candle to the Ford Flex. They 
are both utterly outclassed&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>The Acadia for sure, it looks like it burns the blood of virgins and expels 
cigar smoke from the exhaust. Although that&rsquo;s just a facade since this is 
a smaller &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; type vehicle it still looks great, and manly. 
The Traverse isn&rsquo;t ugly by any means but it seems to be less&hellip;. 
serious? Im not really sure.</p> <br>

<p>How about the 2012 Acadia? In all seriousness, I&rsquo;m going to need some 
time for these to grow on me. Of the two I&rsquo;d say the 2013 Traverse is 
better looking, but I was really starting to like the split grille as the 
corporate face of Chevy and it kind of bugs me that it&rsquo;s gone. The Acadia 
looks like a cheap refresh to me, it lost the sophistication that made me call 
it the poor man&rsquo;s American Range Rover (in a good way) and it just looks 
too much like the Terrain and the GMC xB/Cube concept they had out. Still I 
figure with time and seeing them in person they&rsquo;ll both grow on me.</p>

<p>Option C- spend 8 grand more and get a BMW X3 or downsize a little more and 
get a well optioned Tiguan for close to the same price.</p> <br>

<p>Are you trolling? Both of those are terrible crossovers. Not even that, 
they&rsquo;re both hideous.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;d buy an Explorer, but I think the Acadia looks way better than the 
Traverse. The Traverse looks like it&rsquo;s already outdated.</p> <br>

<p>I would abstain. The choice is between the Buick Enclave and the Traverse; 
the Acadia is to Chevy what Mercury was to Ford.</p> <br>

<p>I guess to answer the question I&rsquo;d take the GMC&hellip; I don&rsquo;t 
really see the hype over the Traverse. It looks worse to me, even the Acadia 
looks a little overdone. Truth is, the Lamda triplets are getting a little old 
now, I have a hard time getting excited about the same basic shapes. 
Didn&rsquo;t Toyota do this with the Camry and got flamed for it?</p> <br>

<li> BPR Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;8:39 pm Reply <br>

<p>Neither I&rsquo;d probably pick a Ford Explorer but if I had no choice, the 
Acadia.</p> <br>

<p>I like the back of the Traverse more, but I&rsquo;d have to go with the 
Acadia.</p> <br>

<p>The Traverse looks really good it looks better than the Acadia and almost 
as good as the Durango. Cam&rsquo;t wait to see the Enclave.</p> <br>

<li> colmusstard Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;6:46 pm Reply <br>

<p>I like the new Acadia, though I prefer the old Traverse<br>
 Either way 
they both need a little power boost of about 20hp</p> <br>

<p>Acadia. I look it tough looks. I can&rsquo;t help think Saturn when I look 
at the Traverse.</p> <br>

<p>The Acadia shouldnt exist; instead we should get a version of the new 
trailblazer, badged as a gmc.</p> <br>

<p>Both are great improvements over the current models (which weren&rsquo;t 
ugly to begin with.) If i had to choose between these two, id pick the 
traverse. however, i would still wait to see how the enclave turns out.</p> <br>

<p>acadia&ndash; love the upright grille and squared-off, tough looks.</p> <br>

<p>I think the Chevy&rsquo;s front looks just a little like the Honda CRV. I 
would go with the GMC Acadia any day compared to a car that looks even remotley 
like a Honda product.</p> <br>

<p>The Acadia has this truck grille slapped on a car chassis. It looks like 
fraud!</p> 
<p>The Traverse is true&hellip;..<br>

<p>I absolutely love the new Traverse. I think it looks stunning. I 
wasn&rsquo;t expecting the refresh to look nearly this good.</p> <br>

<p>I will add that I cannot wait to see the Enclave in the next week or so. 
That has been my favorite of the Lambda sisters.</p> <br>

<p>The Chevy. The Acadia looks like a confused whale with a gaping mouth. Not 
an attractive one&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>I really like the look of the new Traverse, either way they are better than 
their, Ford, Dodge and Toyota counterparts. The Traverse is bigger, gets better 
MPG and is more powerful than the rest, not to mention it comes with a better 
warranty.</p> <br>

<li> Toycrusher Posted on: March 29, 2012&nbsp;5:00 am Reply <br>

<p>Definitely better than any Toyota, but Dodge and Ford are still ahead here.

<p>I think we have a hint at the look of the next generation of chevy/gmc full 
size trucks.</p> <br>

<li> Roosevelt209 Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;5:06 pm Reply <br>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, the Traverse is actually 5 inches longer 
than the Acadia. Thats why there is a noticeable gap between the 2nd and 3rd 
rows when folded compared to the Acadia. The Traverse is larger inside, 
although not by much, which would explain why it is also heavier. Just pointing 
that out to those who say they&rsquo;re the exact same car.</p> <br>

<p>Both look very ugly, so neither. I&rsquo;d go with a Durango.</p> <br>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t what the questions asked.</p> <br>

<p>So.</p> <br>
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> 
<li> Zane Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;4:53 pm Reply <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s a win either way. I like the Acadia design overall better, but I 
really like the sharp new front end of the Traverse, even though they oddly 
abandoned the signature Chevy grille.</p> <br>

<p>Wow all the hype for this? Boaring!!!</p> <br>

<li> Max7audi_r10 Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;4:51 pm Reply <br>

<p>Its the exact same car same interior and about 3k difference in price so if 
you really don&rsquo;t like the Chevy&rsquo;s exterior than I guess you could 
waste the 3k</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Vera04 Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;9:29 pm Reply <br>

<p>Yeah, I think the interiors and exteriors are somewhat nice, but I 
couldn&rsquo;t help but think the same thing. I guess that Cocoa Dune leather, 
different HVAC vents, different backlighting of guages, and some exterior 
differientiation is worth about $3000 to the beancounters at GM. They would 
have been better off giving them their own interior personalities.<br>
 
Let&rsquo;s just hope they don&rsquo;t make the Enclave a triplet in this same 
fashion.</p> <br>

<p>Does anyone else think that the shape of the split grill kind of resembles 
the ATS?</p> <br>

<li> IBx1 Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;4:45 pm Reply <br>

<p>Tough choice, since they&rsquo;re both very sharp cars. I&rsquo;m very 
impressed with both refreshes, but I&rsquo;d go with the GMC for the slightly 
more upscale cabin.</p> 
<p>Still waiting to see how the Enclave comes out!</p> <br>

<li> Logan Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;4:45 pm Reply <br>

<p>I would take the Acadia, it looks much more masculine than the Traverse.</p>

<p>And come to think of it, the Traverse&rsquo;s tail lights look like those

<p>Well, love the two tone and colors of the pictured Traverse interior.<br>
 
BUT Gotta go with the GMC though, i am not crazy about the softer shaped 
traverse</p> <br>
</li> 
<li> Roosevelt209 Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;4:16 pm Reply <br>

<p>And does anybody else think the Traverse&rsquo;s tail lights look similar 
to the new Infiniti JX&rsquo;s headlights? Not that anything is wrong with that.

<li> Roosevelt209 Posted on: March 28, 2012&nbsp;4:13 pm Reply <br>

<p>I find it interesting that even with all the added features they actually 
got about 200-300 pounds LIGHTER! Interesting for a refresh and not an overhaul.
</p> 
<p>To answer the question, I will gladly choose an Acadia over a Traverse. Its 
undeniably more masculine looking and has a nicer interior as well as 
additional features. They both should have no problems regaining some lost 
sales to the Explorer and Durango now.</p> <br>
