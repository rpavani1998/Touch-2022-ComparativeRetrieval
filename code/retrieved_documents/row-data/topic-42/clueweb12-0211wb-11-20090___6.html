<p>Dearborn, Mich., Aug. 22, 2011 /PRNewswire/ --</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ford and Toyota are collaborating as equal partners to accelerate consumer 
availability of a new advanced hybrid system for light trucks and SUVs</li> 
<li>New co-developed hybrid system ready for use later this decade on Ford and 
Toyota rear-wheel-drive light trucks and SUVs, delivering greater fuel 
efficiency while still providing customers the capability they want and need
</li> 
<li>Ford and Toyota also will collaborate on development of next-generation 
standards for in-car telematics and Internet-based services</li> </ul> <br>

<p>Ford Motor Company (NYSE:  F) and Toyota Motor Corporation -- the world's 
two leading manufacturers of hybrid vehicles -- today announced they will 
equally collaborate on the development of an advanced new hybrid system for 
light truck and SUV customers.</p> 
<p>Ford and Toyota have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the 
product development collaboration, with the formal agreement expected by next 
year.</p> 
<p>Both companies have been working independently on their own 
future-generation rear-wheel drive hybrid systems. The two now have committed 
to collaborate as equal partners on a new hybrid system for light trucks and 
SUVs. This new hybrid powertrain will bring the full hybrid experience of 
greater fuel efficiency to a new group of truck and SUV customers without 
compromising the capability they require in their vehicles. &nbsp;Ford and 
Toyota believe that their collaboration will allow them to bring these hybrid 
technologies to customers sooner and more affordably than either company could 
have accomplished alone.</p> 
<p>&quot;This agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders 
in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more 
quickly and affordably for our customers,&quot; saidDerrick Kuzak, Ford group 
vice president, Global Product Development. &quot;Ford achieved a breakthrough 
with the Ford Fusion Hybrid, and we intend to do this again for a new group of 
truck and SUV buyers -- customers we know very well.&quot;</p> 
<p>Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota executive vice president, Research &amp; 
Development, said: &quot;In 1997, we launched the first-generation Prius, the 
world's first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid. Since then, we have sold 
about 3.3 million hybrid vehicles. We expect to create exciting technologies 
that benefit society with Ford -- and we can do so through the experience the 
two companies have in hybrid technology.&quot;</p> 
<p>The two companies also agreed to work together on enablers to complement 
each company's existing telematics platform standards, helping bring more 
Internet-based services and useful information to consumers globally.</p> 
<p>Under the MOU agreement, the two companies will bring the best of their 
independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and knowledge to a new 
co-developed hybrid system, which will be used in rear-wheel-drive light trucks 
arriving later this decade. &nbsp;Specifically, Ford and Toyota will:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Jointly develop as equal partners a new rear-wheel drive hybrid system and 
component technology for light trucks and SUVs</li> 
<li>Independently integrate the new hybrid system in their future vehicles 
separately</li> </ul> <br>

<p>For years, both Ford and Toyota have been working independently on similar 
new rear-wheel-drive hybrid systems aimed at delivering higher fuel economy in 
light trucks and SUVs. When the two companies began discussing this potential 
collaboration, they discovered how quickly they were able to find common ground.
</p> 
<p>&quot;By working together, we will be able to serve our customers with the 
very best affordable, advanced powertrains, delivering even better fuel 
economy,&quot; said Ford President and CEOAlan Mulally. &quot;This is the kind 
of collaborative effort that is required to address the big global challenges 
of energy independence and environmental sustainability.&quot;</p> 
<p>Toyota President Akio Toyoda added: &quot;Toyota is extremely proud to join 
Ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and SUVs. Not only is this 
tie-up clearly one aimed at making automobiles ever better, it should also 
become an important building block for future mobility in the U.S. By building 
a global, long-term relationship with Ford, our desire is to be able to 
continue to provide people in America automobiles that exceed their 
expectations.&quot;</p> 
<p>This rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will be based on an all-new 
architecture to deliver the capability truck and SUV customers demand while 
providing greater fuel economy.</p> 
<p>While the rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will share significant common 
technology and components, Ford and Toyota will individually integrate the 
system into their own vehicles. Each company also will determine the 
calibration and performance dynamics characteristics of their respective light 
pickups and SUVs.</p> 
<p>In addition, as telematics plays an increasingly more important role in the 
in-car experience, both companies have agreed to collaborate on standards and 
technologies needed to enable a safer, more secure and more convenient in-car 
experience for next-generation telematics systems. &nbsp;The telematics 
collaboration relates only to standards and technologies, and each company will 
continue to separately develop their own in-vehicle products and features.</p> 
<p>&quot;Ford has made tremendous progress in the area of telematics,&quot; 
Kuzak said. &quot;We have unique and very good solutions today with SYNC and 
MyFordTouch. Working together on in-vehicle standards can only enhance our 
customers' experience with their vehicles.&quot;</p> 
<p>Uchiyamada added: &quot;Toyota has also invested heavily in telematics in 
various countries around the world, with services like the G-BOOK and G-Link. 
In the U.S., we have just introduced the accessible, easy-to-use Entune. By 
sharing our know-how and experience, we would like to offer even better 
telematics services in the future.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
