<br>
 Thank 
you, Mr. Kuzak. We have just signed a memorandum of understanding for 
collaboration with Ford. Both companies will now begin making preparations for 
joint work on new technologies. We are counting on those technologies to 
benefit customers in the United States and around the world.  &nbsp;  It has 
been more than hundred years since the first car was born, and our industry is 
now facing several challenges. Offering safe cars is a given for any automaker, 
but one can say the greatest challenges are &ldquo;conserving energy&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;reducing greenhouse gas.&rdquo; &nbsp;  Toyota achieved a breakthrough 
in these challenges in nineteen ninety-seven (1997). That is when we launched 
the first-generation Prius as the world&rsquo;s first mass-production 
gasoline-electric hybrid.  &nbsp;  Since then, we have begun producing hybrid 
vehicles in the United States, China, Europe, Australia, and Thailand, as well 
as in Japan. We have sold about three-point-three (3.3) million hybrid vehicles 
in about eighty (80) nations. <br>
 Our collaboration with Ford is a move to 
make hybrid technology more widely available in sport-utility vehicles and in 
trucks. Those kinds of models are indispensable to American customers. And 
providing them with our hybrid technology will help conserve energy and reduce 
output of greenhouse gas here in the United States. That was our thinking in 
considering the collaboration.  &nbsp;  Ford was also a pioneer in developing 
hybrid technology. And it is a traditional leader in sport-utility vehicles and 
in trucks. So we are extremely honored to be undertaking preparations for joint 
work with Ford.  &nbsp;  We need to think carefully about how to ensure that 
cars remain valuable to society in their second century. Great advances in 
information technology and in communications are transforming the world. And 
automobiles need to be part of those advances.  &nbsp;  Information technology 
and communications will play a big role in future transport. Vehicles will no 
longer be self-contained units. They will be part of a larger interaction with 
other vehicles and with the transport infrastructure.  &nbsp;  Cars will 
fulfill a new role in people&rsquo;s lives. We at Toyota believe that cars can 
and will become partners in more-fulfilling lifestyles.  &nbsp;  The foundation 
for the changes that I am describing will be telematics technologies. We at 
Toyota have commercialized several technologies in anticipation of the coming 
revolution in telematics. For example, we launched our Gazoo automotive portal 
site in nineteen ninety-eight (1998). And we began offering our G-Book 
telematics service in two thousand two (2002). In the U.S., we have just 
introduced the accessible, easy-to-use Entune. By sharing our know-how and 
experience, we would like to offer even better telematics services going 
forward. &nbsp;  In the future, plug-in hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles 
will be connected with home energy systems, and with energy infrastructure. 
That will help raise overall energy efficiency, and motoring lifestyles will 
become more rewarding.  &nbsp;  Ford has also been building telematics systems 
and for the same reasons. By sharing our know-how and experience, we can 
transform what is considered as a &ldquo;dream&rdquo; into &ldquo;practical 
reality.&rdquo; &nbsp;  In closing, let me sum up my thoughts on this 
collaboration.  &nbsp;  We expect to create exciting and socially beneficial 
technologies with Ford, and we can do so because our 2 companies have enough 
experience to create a synergy effect in hybrid technology and in telematics.
<br> <br>
 At the same time, we will compete harder than ever in the spirit of 
&ldquo;making great cars.&rdquo; Our competitive stance will help maximize 
benefits for customers and for society at large.  &nbsp;  We are counting on 
this collaboration&nbsp; between Toyota and Ford to benefit American society 
and to open a new page in the history of the world automobile industry. As an 
engineer, I will be deeply gratified to see us fulfill those aims.  &nbsp;  We 
have a lot of details to work out with Ford before we can tell you more about 
our collaboration.  In the meantime, we are grateful for your interest and 
understanding.  &nbsp;  Thank you.
