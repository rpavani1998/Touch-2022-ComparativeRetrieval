<li>The Escape Hybrid is the first hybrid SUV and the first American-made 
hybrid.&nbsp;The Front Wheel Drive&nbsp;(FWD) version&nbsp;achieves a 28 
percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional 
FWD Escape. This reduction is lower than the 32 percent reduction of the Toyota 
Highlander Hybrid, but is enough to make the Ford Escape Hybrid FWD the most 
efficient compact SUV on the market. The Ford Escape Hybrid will be 
discontinued in 2013 and replaced by a conventional gas-powered Ford Escape 
with a 1.6-liter &ldquo;EcoBoost&rdquo; engine expected to get better highway 
fuel economy than the current Escape Hybrid.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>EPA Smog Score (10 best): 8 </li> 
<li>Toyota brings hybrid technology to the luxury and midsize SUV market, but 
with a total power output of an excessive 268 hp, the RX 400h falls into the 
&ldquo;muscle hybrid&rdquo; category. Replaced by more efficient RX 450h in

<li>With a 32 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the 
conventional Highlander, the Highlander Hybrid is not only a class leader, but 
trails only the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, Toyota Prius, Lexus CT 200h, and Ford 
Fusion Hybrid for greatest global warming emissions reduction among all 
hybrids. This impressive performance does come with a caveat, however. While 
the closest conventional counterpart for the Highlander Hybrid 4WD is a 
six-cylinder gasoline engine, the conventional Highlander is available in a 
four-cylinder variety.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Significantly redesigned in 2006, the new Civic Hybrid boosts mileage and 
reduces emissions while providing more &ldquo;pep.&rdquo; The 2011 Civic Hybrid 
obtains a 29 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the 
conventional Civic&mdash;a solid overall performance, though numerous other 
vehicles (including the new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid) have now passed the 30 
percent improvement mark. Its overall fuel economy matches the Honda Insight, 
and its relative reduction of global warming emissions are greater than the 
two-seat Honda CR-Z.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>The Camry Hybrid is the first Toyota hybrid to be built in America 
(Kentucky). In 2009, the Camry Hybrid achieved a 27 percent reduction in global 
warming emissions (compared with the conventional Camry); in 2011, the 
reduction dropped to 21 percent. While still ahead of the Nissan Altima 
Hybrid&rsquo;s 18 percent reduction, the Camry Hybrid trails both the Ford 
Fusion Hybrid (33 percent) and Hyundai Sonata Hybrid (30 percent) by an 
increasingly significant margin.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Compared with the GS 460, the 2011 GS 450h achieves only a 13 percent 
reduction in global warming emissions, despite downsizing from a 4.6-liter V8 
engine to a 3.5-liter V6 engine. This is less than half the global warming 
emissions improvement than that of its cousin, the Lexus HS 250h (over its own 
conventional counterpart), and half that of its more direct competitor, the 
Infiniti M Hybrid.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Nissan enters the hybrid market with the Altima Hybrid. Using Toyota's 
Hybrid Synergy Drive,&nbsp;the 2011 model obtains&nbsp;an 18 percent reduction 
in global warming emissions compared with the conventional Altima.&nbsp; The 
Altima Hybrid falls short of the reduction achieved by many of its peers, 
including the Toyota Camry Hybrid (21 percent). While the Altima Hybrid was 
near the top of the non-luxury sedan class when it was first released, the Ford 
Fusion Hybrid and the new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid have since surpassed the Altima 
Hybrid&rsquo;s performance by achieving global warming reductions of 30 percent 
or more.</li> </ul> <br>
2008 Lexus LS 600h&nbsp;L (5 seat luxury sedan)&nbsp;

<li>EPA Smog Score: 8 </li> 
<li>In contrast to the rest of the hybrid vehicles in the Lexus fleet, which 
achieve Hybrid Value ratings ranging from &ldquo;Good&rdquo; to 
&ldquo;Superior,&rdquo; the 2011 LS 600h L has far and away the lowest Hybrid 
Value rating of all hybrid models on the scorecard&mdash;&ldquo;Very 
Poor.&rdquo; In fact, a customer could purchase the conventional LS 460 AWD and 
use the nearly $32,000 hybrid technology premium for the LS 600h L to buy a 
Lexus CT 200h. This exorbitant cost is further exacerbated by the LS 600h 
L&rsquo;s meager 10 percent global warming emission reductions. Even in this 
high-end vehicle, this kind of cost differential helps to perpetuate the 
stereotype that hybrid technology is cost-prohibitive.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best): 6 </li> 
<li>The Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid is the first full-size SUV hybrid on the market 
and the first vehicle of any kind to use GM&rsquo;s two-mode hybrid system. 
Although the conventional Chevy Tahoe 2WD saw a small improvement in fuel 
efficiency over 2010, the 2011 Tahoe Hybrid remained constant at 21 mpg. As a 
result, the 2011 Chevy Tahoe Hybrid 2WD achieved a lower global warming 
emissions reduction (19 percent). The Tahoe&rsquo;s impressive two-mode, 
full-hybrid drivetrain could have been used to bring far more to the table. 
Instead, GM failed to fully capitalize on hybrid technology and used an upsized 
6.0-liter V8 engine.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Like most vehicle &ldquo;twins,&rdquo; the GMC Yukon Hybrid is nearly 
identical to the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid. While the conventional model of the GM 
Yukon 2WD actually saw a small improvement in fuel efficiency over 2010, the 
Yukon Hybrid 2WD remained constant at 21 mpg. As a result, the 2011 Yukon 
Hybrid 2WD achieved a lower global warming emissions reduction (19 percent). 
The Yukon Hybrid 2WD&rsquo;s impressive two-mode, full hybrid drivetrain could 
have been used to bring far more to the table as the first full-sized hybrid 
SUV. Instead, GM failed to fully capitalize on hybrid technology and used an 
upsized 6.0-liter V8 engine.&nbsp;<br>

2009 Dodge Durango Hybrid (8 seat full-size SUV)&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>EPA Estimated Combined MPG:&nbsp; 21 </li> 
<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best):&nbsp; 6 </li> 
<li>Employing GM&rsquo;s two-mode system, the short-lived Dodge Durango Hybrid 
used a muscular 5.7 L V8 Hemi.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Production of the Durango Hybrid and its sister model, the Chrysler Aspen 
Hybrid, was discontinued after only two-months of full-scale production.&nbsp;
</li> </ul> <br>
2009 Chrysler Aspen Hybrid (8 seat full-size SUV)&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>EPA Estimated Combined MPG:&nbsp; 21 </li> 
<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best):&nbsp; 6 </li> 
<li>Virtually identical to the Dodge Durango Hybrid, the marginally more 
expensive Chrysler Aspen Hybrid met the same unfortunate end as the Durango. As 
models that compromised the efficiency of the two-mode system with massive 
engines, they became the first green(ish) vehicle casualties of the plummeting 
fortunes of U.S. automakers.</li> 
<li>Production discontinued in 2010.</li> </ul> <br>
2009 Cadillac Escalade 
Hybrid (8 seat full-size SUV)&nbsp; <br>

<li>EPA Estimated Combined MPG:&nbsp; 21 </li> 
<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best):&nbsp; 6 </li> 
<li>The luxury SUV Escalade incorporates GM&rsquo;s two-mode hybrid system. A 
bright spot for the Escalade Hybrid is that in 2011 Cadillac is charging a 
modest $3,170 for the hybrid system, which is significantly less than those in 
many other hybrid SUVs. Despite its poor smog-forming emissions performance 
(which significantly lowered its Environmental Improvement Score), the 29 
percent reduction in global warming emissions puts the Escalade Hybrid 4 Wheel 
Drive (4WD) in the &ldquo;Very Good&rdquo; range for Hybrid Value, the only SUV 
to achieve that ranking. Unfortunately, bloated &quot;forced features&quot; 
make the premium for the vehicle very steep.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best):&nbsp; 6 </li> 
<li>GM is charging $4,389 for the hybrid system in the 2011 Silverado Hybrid 4 
Wheel Drive (4WD). With a 19 percent reduction in global warming emissions, 
this gives the Silverado Hybrid 4WD a Hybrid Value rating in the lower-end of 
the&nbsp;&ldquo;Good&rdquo; range. It outperforms the 2WD Silverado Hybrid, 
which merits a &quot;Very Poor&quot;&nbsp;on value, because of the 4WD's lower 
hybrid technology cost and slightly better global warming emissions reductions.

<li>A virtual twin of the Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, the 2011 GMC Sierra 
Hybrid&nbsp;4 Wheel Drive (4WD) merits a&nbsp;19 percent reduction in global 
warming emissions compared with the conventional Sierra 4WD.&nbsp; This puts 
Sierra Hybrid 4WD is toward the bottom of the overall hybrid pack. The Sierra 
Hybrid 4WD does, however, achieve the same fuel efficiency as the Sierra Hybrid 
2WD.</li> </ul> <br>
2010&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;2010 Mercedes-Benz ML450 
Hybrid (5 seat midsize SUV) <br>
&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>EPA Estimated Combined MPG:&nbsp; 22</li> 
<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best):&nbsp; 8</li> 
<li>What we know: Mercedes has released this vehicle with a base MSRP of 
$55,000, but it is only for limited lease for 36 or 60 months at $659 or $549 
per month because Mercedes says it is having battery availability issues. 
Employing the two-mode system developed in partnership with BMW and GM, the 
vehicle has a 275-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine and two electric 
motors. Mercedes is using a battery pack almost half over as large GM&rsquo;s 
various Two-Mode hybrids. The all-wheel drive ML450 Hybrid is powered by a 3.5L 
V6 engine and two electric motors, giving it a total system output of 335 hp 
and 354 lb-ft of torque. It is built at Mercedes-Benz's Tuscaloosa, Alabama 
plant solely for North American consumption.&nbsp; &nbsp; Information on 
vehicle availability can be found at theofficial Mercedes website.</li> </ul>

<li>EPA Smog Score (10=best):&nbsp; 9</li> 
<li>The S400 Hybrid gains a 14 percent reduction in global warming emissions 
compared with the conventional S550 . The low smog-forming emissions of the 
S400 Hybrid results in an EPA air pollution score of 9 out of 10. One might 
expect a greater reduction in global warming emissions given that Mercedes-Benz 
downsized to a V6 engine, resulting in a vehicle that has about 30 percent less 
horsepower than the V8 engine in the S550. Yet, the Infiniti M Hybrid achieves 
a 28 percent reduction in global warming emissions without engine downsizing.

<li>The 2011 Fusion shows marked improvements to the Ford hybrid drivetrain, 
with the ability to reach 47 mph in pure electric mode, and a more seamless 
shift from using electric to gasoline engine power. The fuel economy compares 
favorably to&nbsp;the Camry Hybrid.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Undercutting the Prius in price, the totally redesigned Honda Insight 
provides the only under hybrid option currently on the market for under 
$20,000.&nbsp; Improvements to the Insight&rsquo;s mild hybrid drivetrain keep 
this 5-seat version over 40mpg, but the Civic Hybrid and Prius still top it for 
fuel economy, and both have significantly more passenger room. Honda has 
retooled the Model Year 2012 Insight to improve its efficiency and reduce 
emissions. Debuting at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show, Honda claims it has 
reduced CO2 emissions from the previous model's 108 g/km to a claimed 96, a 
12.5 percent improvement.&nbsp; This would put it under the 99 g/km threshold 
to qualify for European tax exemptions.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the same model will 
also come to the US market.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Lexus introduced the RX 450h in model year 2010, replacing its first 
hybrid SUV, the RX 400h. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) version of this midsize 
SUV seats five people and gets a combined EPA estimated fuel economy of 30 
miles per gallon (mpg), the first midsize SUV to reach that mark. The RX 450h 
FWD utilizes a more efficient Atkinson combustion cycle in its gasoline engine, 
which, combined with a hybrid drivetrain, gives it significant global warming 
emissions reductions.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>The HS 250h was a pioneer in choosing to downsize the gasoline engine to 
provide an efficiency and emissions-focused hybrid option in the luxury class. 
With a 31 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the IS 
250, the HS 250h is in the top tier of hybrids for emissions performance The 
use of a more efficient gasoline engine with the hybrid system provides 
comparable acceleration performance to the IS 250 (rather than boost 
acceleration, as is the case with some hybrids) and allows Lexus to achieve a 
strong environmental performance with the HS 250h.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <br>

air pollution score of just 6 for smog-forming emissions, whereas the Lexus 
450h AWD hybrid merits an impressive 9. These factors combined give the 
ActiveHybrid X6 an Environmental Improvement Score of 3.2, ahead of only the 
Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid at the bottom of this category. BMW decided to

<li>For those looking for a luxury sedan, it is hard to ignore the MKZ 
Hybrid&rsquo;s 46 percent reduction in global warming emissions over the 
conventional MKZ. Indeed, many consumers have already noticed this as sales of 
the MKZ Hybrid have to date exceeded Ford&rsquo;s own projections. The Lexus HS

<li>What we know: The Dodge Ram Hybrid was supposed to enter the market in 
2010 with the same two-mode technology as the Durango and Aspen hybrids. Using 
a 5.7-liter Hemi V8, the two-mode system will increase overall fuel economy by 
approximately 25 percent.&nbsp; But citing slow sales of Silverado Hybrids, 
Chrysler executives decided to pull the plug on production in March 2010. 
Chrysler will still use the Two Mode hybrid transmission to develop a test 
group of plug-in hybrid electric Rams as part of a $48 million grant from the 
U.S. Department of Energy.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Indicating an entirely new direction for GM, the Chevrolet 
Volt&nbsp;introduced the first plug-in hybrid vehicle&nbsp;on the U.S. market. 
GM&nbsp;says Volt can run on electric power alone for 40 miles, though in 
reality the range seems more in the 25-30 mile range on average. When the 
battery has less than 30 percent of its charge remaining, the engine will turn 
on to charge the battery and extend the range of the Volt up to 640 miles. To 
charge, the Volt can be plugged into a 240-volt outlet for a full charge in

mass-produced plug-in hybrid. The F3DM went on sale to government agencies and 
corporations in China for the price of about $20,000 in December 2008.&nbsp; 
The model tested in the U.S. has an all-electric range of approximately 31 
miles with a total range of around 340 miles when using its 3-cylinder engine 
with a 7.4 gallon tank. Unlike other hybrids, the F3DM uses 
iron-phosphate-based lithium-ion batteries, which are cheaper and can reach 50 
percent charge in 10 minutes, and can be fully recharged from a household 
outlet in 9 hours.&nbsp; The expected price tag for the U.S. model is under 
$30,000, and with federal incentives may be close to $20,000&mdash;by far the 
lowest-priced plug-in vehicle on the market if that holds true.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Est. release date: 2012 </li> 
<li>What we know: After ending production of the disappointing 
&ldquo;hollow&rdquo; Chevrolet Malibu hybrid in 2009, GM has announced that it 
will employ the improved mild hybrid system being used in the Buick LaCrosse 
and Regal eAssist in the redesigned Model Year 2013 Malibu. The Malibu itself 
is being redesigned with efficiency in mind, as engineers have found more than 
60 counts of wind drag that have been removed to fine-tune the exterior of the 
new Malibu for the best aerodynamics possible. Together the aerodynamic tweaks 
improve the fuel economy of the vehicle by 2.5 mpg on the highway.&nbsp; GM 
says the eAssist Malibu variant will get 26mpg city, 38mpg highway, 1 mpg 
better in the city and 2 mpg better on the highway than the Buick Regal eAssist.

<ul> 
<li>Est. release date: 2012 </li> 
<li>What we know: Toyota will be bringing its first plug-in hybrid to market 
in a familiar form.&nbsp; The Prius Plug-in will use a lithium-ion battery pack 
to enable around a 14 mile electric only driving range at far higher speeds 
than the current Prius. .&nbsp; When the battery system no longer has enough 
power to operate alone, it will then run as a traditional full hybrid.&nbsp; 
The gasoline engine will also assist at higher speeds or heavy acceleration. 
Toyota estimates combined fuel economy at around 107mpg,&nbsp; and CO2 
emissions at 49 g/km, but as with all plug-in vehicles, mileage and emissions 
will vary widely with driver useToyota plans a run of about 17,000 Prius 
Plug-ins in the first year.&nbsp; Price estimates are running from the 
high-$20,000 to high-$30,000 range, before tax credits.Toyota recommends a 
basic 120V house socket to charge the Plug-In Prius although it is also 
compatible with a 240V charging connection. Toyota says it plans to make the 
Prius Plug-in available in March or April 2012 in Arizona, California, 
Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington; it will

started last month on a new plant near St Petersburg and Prokhorov has said he 
wants to make a unique eco-friendly hybrid car which would cost less than 
$10,000<strong>&nbsp;</strong>. </p> 
<h1><strong>Buyer Beware&nbsp;the Hollow Hybrids:</strong></h1> 
<p><strong>Some vehicles have been introduced or will be introduced to the 
market with the hybrid label, but really only use some conventional technology 
improvements to gain marginal fuel economy improvements.&nbsp; Such 
improvements would be laudable if introduced as standard options throughout a 
model fleet.&nbsp; But to make these improvements to only a small number of 
vehicles and use the &quot;hybrid label&quot; to gain a greener stature 
undermines the integrity of the hybrid market.&nbsp; We have labeled these 
vehicles as &quot;hollow hybrids&quot; and, as a &quot;caveat emptor&quot; for 
hybrid consumers, we list these models below.</strong></p>
