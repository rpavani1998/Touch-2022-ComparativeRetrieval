 I drive a 1982 
Toyota pickup. It has 415,000 miles on the original motor, and in the 3 years 
I've had it, I haven't had a single problem.<br>
<br>
My buddy bought a 1983 
Ford ranger a few years back, and he's had to replace the engine, the starter, 
the fuel pump, the bed (rust), and right now hes thinking the tranny is going 
out.<br>
<br>
There's a reason why Toyota has the best truck reputation in the 
world, they're the toughest. Here's quite an interesting article about just 
that:http://www.thedailyb &#8203; east.com/newsweek/20 &#8203; 
10/10/14/why-rebel-g &#8203; roups-love-the-toyot &#8203; a-hilux.html <br>
<br>
&ldquo;The Toyota Hilux is everywhere,&rdquo; says Andrew Exum, a former Army 
Ranger and now a fellow of the Center for a New American Security. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the vehicular equivalent of the AK-47. It&rsquo;s ubiquitous 
to insurgent warfare. And actually, recently, also counterinsurgent warfare. It 
kicks the hell out of the Humvee.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The only place Toyota isn't 
as respected as it should be, is America. The reason? Americans don't use their 
trucks to do anything like what others do. I'd say 90% of the people I know use 
their trucks for hauling garbage to the dump, maybe some firewood to their 
house, the countries where Toyota is king? They ride them into war, they've 
never seen pavement (most trucks here have never seen anything but), they use 
them to cross the desert or the jungle. The United States Special Forces even 
drive the Toyota Tacoma on their deployments.<br>
<br>
And I'm sure we all 
remember the Indestructible Hilux on Top Gear? They then crashed it into a 
tree, submerged it in the ocean for five hours, dropped it from about 10 feet, 
tried to crush it under an RV, drove it through a portable building, hit it 
with a wrecking ball, and set it on fire. Finally they placed it on top of a 
240-foot tower block that was then destroyed in a controlled demolition. When 
they dug it out of the rubble, all it took to get it running again was hammers, 
wrenches, and WD-40. They didn&rsquo;t even need spare parts.<br>
<br>
I know 
most of you are too patriotic to agree with me, but if you look at the facts, 
Toyota has made some of the best trucks ever. Light, maneuverable, fast, 
nimble, reliable, and great ground clearance. I have no reason to drive a gas 
guzzling behemoth of a truck, and I know most of you don't either, and that's 
why I will always drive a Toyota truck.<br>

from the FordDealer in Steubenville, Ohio on January 15th 1978, I just put a 
new&nbsp; 300 six in my truck, 3.200.000 miles, I changed my oil EVERY 3000 
miles I am on my second clutch, pressure plate, throughout bearing , 2nd set of 
front hubs, 2 nd set of front u-joints, my 3 steering box, my second gas tank, 
point is the name of the product seldom matters it is how the owner takes care 
of the vehicle that counts, used the very best motor oil, that &quot;Racers 
Edge&quot; stuff. my truck have been on the road or the past 32 years and it is 
still going strong and I have NO plans on replacing it.&nbsp;

 Gee, it wasn't 
more than a few weeks ago MSN had an article about how 'bad' Ford trucks were, 
350-250 and the worst of all for failures of all kinds, the150/Lincoln model. 
Hmmmm,wonder who was taken to the woodshed. It doesn't matter in the least what 
anyone buys to me,but be assurred the pricing is outrageous,and the economy is 
gone with new EPA requirements which have a devastating effect on what little 
reliability Ford might have had. MOPAR or nocar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8

 You can argue all 
you want, but it does come down to ONLY two; Ford and GM. I'm personally a GM 
guy for a reason. You can say all you want about GM, but in the end...ALL car 
companies are NOT American made, not 100% at least. But the real winner is 
still GM. The Duramax is almost impossible to beat. Better power, more towing 
capabilities, and not to mention the tranny is virtually bulletproof. Allison 
all the way. Oh and Ford has only been the best selling truck, because you have 
to buy two in the same year. When the engine dies or the tranny...that is 
why...hate to burst the Ford lovers bubble on that.<br>

<h1>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h1> 
<p>By&nbsp;Tom Wilson&nbsp;of&nbsp;MSN Autos</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<p>With so many new vehicles on the market, picking just one is a challenge, 
especially if you're looking for a newpickup truck. Not only are there multiple 
manufacturers, each with more than one model to choose from, but each pickup 
comes in a bewildering variety ofcab styles, wheelbases, trim levels, engine 
options, transmission choices and 2- or 4-wheel drive. To help narrow the 
search, we've collected some of our bang-for-the-truck-buck favorites. You'll 
find a range of offerings here, from compacts to full-size to heavy-duty 
models, each selected with an eye toward balancing capacity and performance 
with cost.</p> 
<p><strong>Read:</strong>&nbsp; Pickup Trucks, Tow to Tow</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Ford Ranger</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $17,935 to $26,025<br>
Ford is discontinuing the 
Ranger after the 2011 model year, so it might seem strange to put it on a 
10-best list. This compact truck is a hoary old thing &mdash; basic and lacking 
frills, but tough as nails and light on the checkbook. Kept simple with an 
anemic 2.3-liter 4-banger engine and a 5-speed manual transmission, it's an 
easygoing runabout that'll tote any sort of bulky or dirty gear. In fact, it's 
perfect for any odd job and can be had for just a bit more than $12,000 on sale.
</p> 
<p><strong>Bing:</strong> Ford Ranger<br>
</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Nissan Frontier</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $17,540 to $29,820<br>
When there are no more 
Rangers, Nissan'sFrontier will lead the entry-level compact truck market 
nicely. True, up hills and in modern traffic it's lethargic in 4-cylinder form. 
But step up to the V6 engine and it rockets right along. Like theRanger, the 
Nissan is cheap to buy, easy on gas and handy to drive in town or through tight 
spots on the ranch, and it is a decent off-roader. Unlike the Ranger, though, 
it's definitely a little larger and more comfortable inside. It's also 
available as a crew cab if four doors are a must-have feature.</p> 
<p><strong>Bing Images:</strong> Nissan Frontier</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Toyota Tacoma</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $16,365 to $25,525<br>
If our first two trucks are 
notable mainly for their low price, this midsize offering makes the grade on 
capability, features and reputation. TheTacoma boasts excellent build quality 
and a fantastic resale value that make it a great buy. But the Tacoma's 
reputation as the best midsize pickup is genuinely earned on both performance 
and quality; it's a comfortable, stylish truck that doesn't shy from real work. 
We'd opt for the 4.0-liter V6 engine for the oomph expected in a midsize truck, 
as well as for providing the up to 6,500-pound tow rating.</p> 
<p><strong>Compare:</strong> Toyota Tacoma vs. Ford Ranger vs. Nissan Frontier
</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Dodge Dakota</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $22,755 to $33,180<br>
Just as parent company Chrysler
 invented the minivan,Dodge invented the midsize pickup with the Dakota more 
than 20 years ago, and the experience shows. Perfectly sized and very stylish, 
the Dakota also indulges Dodge's habit of not sparing the power. Fitted with 
the optional 4.7-liter V8 engine, the Dakota is a torquey powerhouse that takes 
top honors in payload capacity and offers up to a 7,000-pound tow rating; most 
midsize trucks tow around 4,700 pounds. Just be careful not to option the 
Dakota too far into full-size territory, which is easy to do.</p> 
<p><strong>Bing:</strong> Dodge Dakota Accessories</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Dodge Ram 1500</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $20,610 to $42,650<br>
When the Dakota isn't enough, 
it's time to consider the first full-size pickup on our list, theRam 1500. A 
real workhorse &mdash; as suggested by its clean, bold styling &mdash; the Ram 
is financially superior with its smaller 4.7-liter V8 engine, but it's far more 
fun and capable with the 390-horsepower 5.7-liter multidisplacement HEMI. It 
tows far more that way and gets the same mileage. But the Ram's hidden secret 
is its coil-spring rear suspension, which gives it a supple ride and precise 
handling, and there's still enough truck muscle left for durability and rough 
duty.</p>

<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Ford F-150 XLT Custom</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $27,710 to $33,895<br>
Class-leading in almost every 
respect and boasting all-new engines, the 2011Ford F-150 lineup is particularly 
strong, but the XLT Custom is purpose-built for the bang-for-the-buck buyer. 
Nicely equipped with midlevel trim, a 4x2 driveline and the fuel-sipping, 
3.7-liter 302-horsepower V6 engine, the XLT Custom can tow 6,100 pounds and 
looks good doing it, with its chrome grille and tailpipe, 18-inch wheels and 
unique cloth trim. The Custom option is also available with the SuperCrew and 
SuperCab trims as well.</p> 
<p><strong>Read:</strong>&nbsp; Keep on Truckin'</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Ford F-150 3.5-liter EcoBoost</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $24,465 to $48,795<br>
Ford is onto something with 
its combination of gasoline direct-injection and dual turbocharging. They call 
it EcoBoost, and with the 2011 F-150's new 3.5-liter V6 engine, it delivers 420 
lb-ft of diesel-like torque, 365 horsepower and highway mileage into the 
mid-20s. Able to tow up to 11,300 pounds, the EcoBoost V6 is a $1,750 premium 
over the nonturbocharged base V6, which is far less than what an equivalent 
diesel would have cost. Best yet, the power is instant and quiet. This truck is 
definitely worth a look if you're looking for a true workhorse.</p> 
<p><strong>Read:</strong>&nbsp; Ford Expands EcoBoost Engine Rollout</p> 
<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Chevrolet Silverado 1500</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $20,850 to $41,775<br>
Robust, durable engines that 
aren't technically overboard &mdash; read &quot;simple&quot; &mdash; are a 
hallmark of Chevy trucks. Available anywhere in the U.S., priced right and 
often available in numerous boots-and-jeans versions where other makes 
emphasize suburban style, Chevy'sSilverado series rides a wave of deep-seated 
popularity. If pricing is paramount, the 4.3-liter V6 engine is as proven and 
reliable as the sunrise, but well down on power. We'd concentrate on the 
5.3-liter V8 for much better power and essentially the same fuel economy.Chevy 
also offers a hybrid, but bang for the buck is last on its list of attributes.

<h3>Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $31,760 to $44,950<br>
When it comes to the bruising, 
heavy-duty pickups, it's truly tough to pick a favorite, although we'll say the 
pricey diesel options are still the way to go, because even though they cost 
bucks, they have incredible bang.Chevy, Dodge and Ford each make one &mdash; 
the imports haven't thought this big yet &mdash; and each has been recently 
updated. We like the smooth, inline 6-cylinder Cummins engine in the Dodge, but 
Chevy'sSilverado HD goes toe-to-toe or better on price and offers 47 more 
horsepower and 115 more lb-ft of torque in its new 6.6-liter V8.</p>

<h2>Best Trucks for the Bucks</h2> 
<h3>Ford F-350 Super Duty</h3> 
<p><em>Price range:</em> $28,740 to $50,440<br>
Leaning more to the 
performance end of our bang-for-the-buck equation, we arrive at the ultimate in 
pickup trucks, theSuper Duty packing the all-new 6.7-liter Ford diesel V8 
engine. We're taking a bit of a gamble here, as this is Ford's first in-house 
diesel, but its 400 horsepower and 800 lb-ft of torque carry the ultimate 
bragging rights, not to mention just about anything tied to its trailer hitch. 
Impressive trim packages, advanced electronics and generally superior detailing 
are there to satisfy those who find quality is nearly always the best buy.</p>
