 Where I live, it's difficult to test new trucks on snowy roads, 
because our wintry precipitation usually only sticks around a couple of hours. 
So I couldn't pass up an opportunity to test drive the 2009 F-150 during a 
dead-of-winter trip to Detroit. It was snowing hard (with no signs of letting 
up) when the truck was delivered, turning my black F-150 SuperCab XLT 4X4 into 
a &quot;snow&quot; white and &quot;slush&quot; gray machine. Winter weather 
continued on and off for several days, eliminating any chance of high speed 
driving and making my time in the truck all about a test of traction control 
and ABS. 
<h3>First Glance at the 2009 Ford F-150 Truck</h3>  At first glance, the most 
obvious part of the new design might be the 2009 F-150's large chrome grille 
and headlight trim, which give the truck a more massive appearance than pickups 
from the previous generation. In fact, the new F-150 looks a whole lot like a 
Super Duty truck.
<p> Front fenders are broad shouldered, and wheel openings are bulged at all 
corners. Although the F-150's front end appears to be squared-off, the truck 
actually has a lower drag coefficient than its predecessors (a new tailgate 
with a spoiler-like top is part of the package that improve aerodynamics).</p> 
<p> This wasn't the first 2009 F-150 I'd driven, so I'll mention some handy 
options you'll find on other trim levels. Like the Platinum Edition'spower 
retractable running boards -- pretty much a necessity for getting in and out of 
today's taller trucks. And if you don't like the looks of running boards, no 
problem, because you only see them when the door is open.</p> 
<p> The F-150's side step is another feature to consider. It mounts below the 
bed, just ahead of the rear wheel, and extends or retracts with a push of your 
foot. The step makes it a lot easier to reach items stored in the front portion 
of the truck bed.</p> 
<p> Another helpful option is the tailgate step, which folds out from the 
tailgate and makes it easy to get up into the bed (a flip-up grab bar is 
included to keep you steady). When not in use, the step folds neatly into the 
tailgate liner, where it doesn't interfere with cargo.</p>

<h3>In the F-150 Pickup Truck's Driver's Seat</h3>

 My test truck had 
leather-covered power bucket seats that were equipped with the heating and 
cooling option. Leather can be pretty cold on a winter morning, so I turned on 
the seat heater while I cleaned the snow off of the windows, and by the time I 
finished, the seats were toasty. I sure didn't test the cooling feature on this 
trip, but it was a big help during a warm-weather drive.
<p> Ford moved the new truck's B-pillar back by 6-inches to improve side 
visibility. A large rear window and oversize outside mirrors remove all traces 
of a blind spot. Six-way power seats, tilt steering and height-adjustable 
pedals allow a person of any size to drive the truck with no obstructions.</p> 
<p> The F-150's console is large enough to hold a laptop and file folders, and 
a large glove box and door panel storage pockets add even more storage. Cup 
holders will accept full-size drinks. Ford engineers designed the rear cab floor
without a center hump, making it possible for inside cargo to sit flat against 
the floor.</p> 
<p> Gauges are large and situated for unobstructed display through the 
steering wheel, and the truck's center stack puts HVAC controls within easy 
reach. My truck was equipped with navigation -- the system shares a screen with 
Sirius Satellite radio and the truck's SYNC voice control.</p> 
<h3>On the Road in the F-150 Pickup Truck</h3>  The 4X4 test truck was 
equipped with a 5.4 liter V-8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. The 
5.4 is a strong running engine with plenty of power for most any needs.
<p> The 6-speed automatic is new for 2009, and a much needed addition that 
helped improve fuel mileage and made it easier to tow and pull hills with a 
load. The transmission can be operated manually (like I did in deep snow), or 
put into &quot;drive&quot; when you don't want or need to fool around with 
shifting (when the selector is in &quot;drive,&quot; you'll find that shifts 
are smooth and predictable).</p> 
<p> Four-wheel drive and Advance Trac with Roll Stability Control each got a 
good workout while driving the truck in Detroit's heavy snow, and both 
performed flawlessly. I was always confident that the truck would go where I 
wanted it to go and stop without sliding out of control. I tested quick 
take-offs in an empty parking lot, and also turned the wheels while braking 
hard -- anti-lock brakes, traction control, roll stability and other systems 
did their jobs. You might not need all of those systems at once on a typical 
drive, but if you do, they could prevent an accident.</p> 
<p> The F-150 is quieter than ever before inside, and new steering bushings 
and dampers eliminate all engine vibrations in the steering wheel when the 
truck is sitting at idle.</p> 
<h3>End of the F-150 Journey</h3> 
<p>2009 Ford F-150 Trucks</p> &copy; Dale Wickell <br>
 I've driven the 2009 
Ford F-150 several times under different conditions, and remain impressed with 
its capabilities. Ford engineers put plenty of thought into all aspects of the 
truck, from its performance to its fit to its ride.
<p> The current offering of pickups from all manufactures is the best it has 
been in years, but if I were going to buy a new truck today, it would probably 
be an F-150.</p> 
<p> MSRP: $21,565 - $36,100</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>More F-150 Drives</h3> 
<p> My first 2009 F-150 drive took place at Ford's Michigan Proving Ground, a 
test facility with over 100 miles of roads. Ford brought in its new F-150s, 
Toyota Tundras, Chevy Silverados and Dodge Rams, setting up test tracks where 
drivers could compare the trucks one-on-one in different conditions.</p>
