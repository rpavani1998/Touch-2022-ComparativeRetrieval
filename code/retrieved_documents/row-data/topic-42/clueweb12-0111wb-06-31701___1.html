<h1> Ford and Toyota to collaborate on hybrid SUVs </h1>  The two companies 
have signed a memorandum of understanding, with a formal agreement expected to 
be in place by next year.<br>
<br>
Both have been working independently on 
their own rear-wheel drive hybrid systems and have now committed to working 
together to develop a new hybrid powertrain that will bring the benefits of 
hybrid to new customer groups, without compromising the capabilities customers 
require of their vehicles.<br>
<br>
Ford and Toyota believe that by working 
together they can deliver these hybrid technologies to customers sooner and 
more affordably than if they worked alone.<br>
<br>
Derrick Kuzack, Ford Group 
President, Global Product Development, said: &ldquo;This agreement brings 
together the capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid 
technology to develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our 
customers.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ford achieved a breakthrough with the Ford Fusion 
Hybrid, and we intend to do this again for a new group of truck and SUV buyers, 
customers we know very well.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota 
Executive Vice President, Research and Development, said: &ldquo;In 1997, we 
launched the first-generation Prius, the world&rsquo;s first mass-produced 
petrol-electric hybrid. Since then, we have sold about 3.3 million hybrid 
vehicles. We expect to create exciting technologies that benefit society with 
Ford, and we can do so through the experience the two companies have in hybrid 
technology.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Ford and Toyota also agreed to work together in 
developing each company&rsquo;s telematics standards, helping to makes more 
internet-based services and information available to customers around the world.
<br> <br>
Under the memorandum of understanding, the two companies will jointly 
develop, as equal partners, a new rear-wheel drive hybrid system and component 
technology for pick-ups and SUVs and separately integrate the new hybrid system 
in their future vehicles.<br>
<br>
Ford and Toyota have been working 
independently for years on similar rear-wheel drive hybrid systems with the aim 
of delivering higher fuel economy in pick-ups and SUVs. When they began 
discussing potential collaboration, they quickly found common ground.<br>
<br>

Although the hybrid system will share significant common technology and 
components, each company will determine the calibration and performance 
characteristics of their respective models which use the new powertrain.<br>

<br>In addition, both companies are to work together on developing 
next-generation telematics standards and technologies for safer, and more 
secure and convenient motoring. Each company will, however, continue to develop 
its own in-vehicle products and features.
