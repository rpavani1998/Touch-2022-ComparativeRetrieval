2011 Ford Explorer <br>
 The Ford Explorer has 
long been one of the best-selling SUVs in the market. The all-new Ford Explorer 
is named the 2011 North American Truck of the Year. Now it finally has what it 
takes to compete with the finest midsize SUVs and crossovers on the market 
according to the critics. Ford has completely redesigned the Explorer for 2011. 
It has a brand new sporting look, better fuel economy and standard third-row 
seating. As per the critics the new model handles to be both a comfortable 
family vehicle and a realistically rugged SUV. The massive change in Ford 
Explorer is [...]<br>

2011 Ford Expedition <br>
 The 2011 Ford 
Expedition is generally wrongly considered as a sports car, but it does offer 
buyers roomy and comfortable interior, strong performance capabilities and is 
reasonably priced. There may be fewer shoppers for full-size SUVs, and not many 
still actually need the outsized passenger and towing abilities these massive 
vehicles provide. Though, for those who do, there&rsquo;s the 2011 Ford 
Expedition. SUVs are the first choice for buyers that need to haul people and 
cargo, and as for the cargo, the Expedition attains a booming win over its 
closest opposition, the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe. The Expedition adds [...]

2011 Ford Flex <br>
 Being in the third year of production, 
Flex gets only a handful of changes for 2011. Last year, a turbo engine option, 
a telescoping steering wheel and a few other feature enhancements were made. In 
2011, Ford Flex gets new trim levels of titanium, but it actually figures to 
little more than minute changes made to the Limited model. Apart from the new 
trim level, optional power-folding third-row seats feature is introduced on 
Limited trim versions and HD radio is a latest feature that comes along with 
the navigation system. The improvisations for 2011 are trivial, but it is 
important [...]<br>

<br>
2011 Ford Edge <br>
 Going on sale this 
summer, the 2011 Ford Edge receives a number of significant improvements, plus 
more than the regular nip and tuck routine job that midsize SUVs commonly 
receive. The improvements have begun from under the hood, where buyers can 
choose from three engines. Topping that list is a new EcoBoost 2.0-liter turbo 
inline-4. Although this engine is not available until later this year, Ford 
maintains that fuel should return 15 percent more than the current 3.5-liter 
V6, which boils down to about 21 miles per gallon in city and 30 mpg on the 
highway drives. The Ford Edge&rsquo;s [...]<br>

2010 Ford Escape 
<br>  The launch of Ford Escape in the 2000s was a runaway hit and went on to 
become one of the best-selling SUVs of the millennium decade. However, the 2010 
Ford Escape SUV does not have too many innovative or interesting features that 
other competitor-rivals have. Starting with the telescopic steering wheel and 
backseat reclines and other features are just not there with the 2010 Ford 
Escape SUV. Similarly one would not find the 2010 Ford Escape SUV to be the 
most versatile or comfortable SUV when compared to other models of the same 
class offering better features and performance. Disadvantages [...]<br>

Zoom! It is Ford F-150 2011 with 
EcoBoost all the way! <br>
 Though there are a few days left to bring out more 
details and driving impressions of the 2011 Ford F-150 pickup and even more 
distinctively, the Blue Oval&rsquo;s four latest heavy-hauling power machines 
for the 2011 season; what we have right now is information on the Ford F-150 
2011 truck SUV which goes on to show what this mighty truck is competent of. 
Undoubtedly the application of Ford&rsquo;s latest EcoBoost technology is 
definitely impressive and as many are conscious, the 3.5-liter twin-turbo power 
SUV truck machine puts down 365 Horsepower and more than sufficient 420 
pound-feet of torque. However, the [...]<br>

2010 Midsize SUV : 
Ford Explorer <br>
 Even in today&rsquo;s highly competitive and saturated SUV 
markets, the Ford Explorer remains one of the best-selling SUV&rsquo;s. The 
reasons for the Ford Explorer&rsquo;s popularity are many; it&rsquo;s a very 
capable tow vehicle and a true off-roader, with generous interior space for 
passengers and luggage, a good range of comfort features and all the necessary 
safety features required by modern consumers. Explorer is unchanged for 2010, 
but buyers should note that Ford is expected to build the 2011 Explorer on a 
car-based platform rather than a truck-based one. These include V8 power, 
seating for five occupants is standard, but an [...]<br>

2010 
Midsize SUV : Ford Edge <br>
 Ford&rsquo;s second foray into the &ldquo;sports 
utility vehicle&rdquo; (SUV) market is the funky, stylish Edge. Debuted smartly 
in 2008 with James Bond&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Quantum of Solace.&rdquo; Ford 
hasn&rsquo;t made any sort of notable changes in the 2010 model. Fuel economy 
improves in the 265-hp V-6 by as much as 2 mpg in the city. The Ford 
Edge&rsquo;s exterior has also established a few styling tweaks, and the 
five-seat SUV is now obtainable with a preference of three engines, including a 
new turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder. Ford tweaked the aerodynamics and 
drive-train of all Edge models after which they get slightly better [...]<br>

2010 Compact SUV : FORD Escape <br>
 2010 Ford Escape is a 
splendid SUV a four wheel drive, styling combined with the running costs and 
footprint of a mid-sized vehicle. As a SUV practical inner-city ride with the 
capability of doing some light off driving and towing at the weekends, Ford 
Escape is a great choice. However, there have been no significant revisions to 
the model for a few years, nevertheless SUV 2010 Ford Escape has some latest 
features namely a new self-parking option, MyKey system which allows the owner 
to program a key that could limit the SUV vehicle&rsquo;s top speed and audio 
volume, a four-cylinder or V-6, [...]<br>

2006 Fullsize SUV : 
FORD Freestyle <br>
 Like the related Five Hundred sedan, the Freestyle has 
midsize dimensions that approach full-size. Ford calls the Freestyle a SUV 
crossover model because it blends the merits of a sport utility vehicle, a 
minivan and a sedan. Built on a unique platform, the 
&ldquo;purpose-built&rdquo; Freestyle can be equipped with front- or all-wheel 
drive. Its 3.0-liter V-6 engine drives a continuously variable transmission. It 
comes in base SE, midrange SEL and top-level Limited trim levels. A navigation 
system is available in 2006 models. Three rows of seats hold six or seven 
occupants in the SUV. Cargo space behind the third-row seat [...]<br>

<br> 2006 Fullsize SUV : FORD Explorer <br>
Ford has reworked its midsize sport 
utility vehicle (SUV) for the 2006 model year, dubbing it &ldquo;the best 
Explorer ever&rdquo; and &ldquo;the most powerful.&rdquo; Mercury has given its 
related Mountaineer SUV similar treatment for 2006. In its new form, the 
4.6-liter V-8, with three valves per cylinder, generates 292 horsepower &mdash; 
a gain of 53 hp &mdash; and drives a new six-speed-automatic transmission. Ford 
claims significantly improved fuel economy and emissions for the 2006 model and 
towing capacity can reach 7,300 pounds. A V-6 version with a 
five-speed-automatic transmission remains available. Four trim levels are still 
offered: XLS, XLT, Eddie Bauer [...]<br>

2006 Fullsize SUV : 
FORD Expedition <br>
 In 2003, Ford hailed its redesigned full-size sport 
utility vehicle (SUV) as the &ldquo;best on the road, best in the dirt, best in 
the snow.&rdquo; The Expedition, which is closely related to the Lincoln 
Navigator, was second in size only to the Excursion in Ford&rsquo;s SUV lineup. 
Now that Ford discontinued the Excursion, the Expedition ranks No. 1 in 
dimensions among Ford&rsquo;s SUVs. All 2006 Expeditions use a 5.4-liter Triton 
V-8. A Reverse Sensing System and a Safety Canopy side curtain-type airbags 
system are now stand-alone options. A chrome-tip exhaust pipe is standard on 
the King Ranch edition. An on-demand ControlTrac [...]<br>

2006 
Compact SUV : FORD Escape Hybrid <br>
 The Escape Hybrid is Ford&rsquo;s first 
entrant into the hybrid segment. Now in its second year of production,
Ford&rsquo;s Escape Hybrid adds a reshuffled options package and a new 
available paint color. The automaker says the SUV yields a 50 percent 
fuel-usage improvement in city and highway driving. The Escape Hybrid also 
meets Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) 
requirements. Ford promises acceleration that rivals V-6-powered models. Other 
changes are minimal. Like other Escapes, the Escape Hybrid seats five 
occupants. A battery charge/usage gauge sits on the left side of the dashboard. 
Ford&rsquo;s hybrid system allows the gas engine and electric traction [...]<br>

2006 Compact SUV : FORD Escape <br>
 Ford&rsquo;s first 
car-based sport utility vehicle debuted for the 2001 model year as a result of
Ford&rsquo;s controlling interest in Mazda, which produces the similar Tribute 
SUV. Given a fresh look inside and out for 2005, the Escape got a new 2.3-liter 
Duratec four-cylinder that develops 153 horsepower. For the first time, 
four-cylinder models were available with an optional automatic transmission. A 
new intelligent automatic four-wheel-drive system became available. Antilock 
brakes are standard, and Safety Canopy rollover protection is optional. XLS,

 About Fuel Economy Figures <br>

<p>The Fuel Economy number is the average combined number of miles a vehicle 
is able to travel using one gallon of fuel according to EPA simulated 
laboratory tests that consist of 45% highway and 55% city driving conditions.
</p> 
<p>For a vehicle model that has styles with differing Fuel Economy numbers, we 
display in the page header the range of values for those styles; only a single 
Fuel Economy number is displayed when all of the values are the same for that 
model's styles. A single Fuel Economy number is also displayed on the 
style-specific vehicle pages.</p> 
<p>We display &quot;N/A&quot; (i) if the EPA has not yet published fuel 
economy data for a vehicle, and (ii) for all &quot;heavy duty&quot; vehicles, 
i.e., vehicles with a gross weight of more than 8,500 pounds (since they are 
not subject to fuel economy regulations and accordingly are not tested by the 
EPA).</p>
