<h1>Ford Focus Electric</h1> <br>

<p>Many electric car companies are still trying to compensate for 
&ldquo;glorified golf car syndrome.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a kind of inferiority 
complex that pushes them to produce ultra-hip, spectacularly innovative, or 
screaming fast electric vehicles&mdash;and to brand them as 
revolutionary&mdash;even though it drives the cost up and out of range for most 
consumers. What about folks who simply want an affordable, dressed-down, 
highway-capable family sedan that runs on electric drive technology 
that&rsquo;s been proven to work for 100 years?</p> 
<p>The answer could be the <strong>Ford Focus Electric</strong> due out in 
late 2011&mdash;the first electric car designed for the generic aisle of the 
dealership. Ford&rsquo;s plans for the Focus EV are not aimed at buzz and 
sizzle. Instead, the company is focused on addressing the biggest obstacle 
between EVs and the mainstream: cost.</p> 
<p>(Sure, those other companies expect to ramp up production, realize 
economies of scale, and eventually reduce costs down to reason. But 
doesn&rsquo;t that seem like a roundabout way to achieve the goal?)</p> 
<h2>Technology As Cool</h2> 
<p>Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm (left) and Nancy Gioia, director of 
sustainable mobility technologies at Ford, check out the Ford Focus EV at the 
2009 Detroit Auto Show.</p> 
<p>The Ford Focus electric will be based on the next-generation Ford Focus, a 
capable if not head-turning car. By choosing an existing platform, Ford will 
save the expense associated with developing a unique design. Ever since the 
second-generation Prius, with its iconic design, became a hit, automakers have 
adopted the idea that a hybrid car with an innovative high-tech drivetrain 
needs to scream out for attention. That&rsquo;s the direction that Nissan is 
taking with theNissan Leaf, due out in limited markets in late 2010. The Chevy 
Volt plug-in hybrid, the new Honda Insight, and the Lexus HS250h are also 
original purpose-built designs.</p> 
<p>Ford is gambling that the cool factor lies in the technology and price, not 
in the car&rsquo;s name or the shape of the sheet metal. Pricing is not yet 
announced, but trimming the cost obviously will give Ford the ability to aim 
for affordability and profitability. (Nissan is aiming for $25,000 to $30,000 
for its EV; and the Chevy Volt will cost in the range of $40,000.)</p> 
<h2>Pre-packaged Technology</h2> 
<p>The second cost-cutting measure is Ford&rsquo;s use of generic pre-made 
electric car technology. In other words, Ford is using a system already 
developed by Magna International, a major global auto supply and technology 
firm, which has been looking for a carmaker to use its new pre-packaged 
electric car architecture, including motor, transmission, motor controller, 
lithium ion battery system and charger. Ford is the first to sign on.</p> 
<p>Magna will also share in the engineering responsibility to integrate the 
electric propulsion system into the Ford Focus electric. Furthermore, 
Ford&rsquo;s deal with Magna is non-exclusive&mdash;so the same system could be 
used by Ford&rsquo;s competition to make an electric cars. In fact, Ford is 
encouraging Magna to spread the high-tech love, because Magna&rsquo;s success 
with EV technology will increase the chances that other car companies will help 
defray costs. Implied in this approach is the likely slow rollout of pure 
electric cars, which could take a decade to grow beyond a niche.</p> 
<p>Ford used a similar strategy with its Sync in-car entertainment system, 
developed in partnership with Microsoft, which can sell the technology to other 
automakers.</p> 
<p><em>The Ford Focus electric</em> is targeted to have a range of 100 miles 
between charges, courtesy of a 23 kWh battery pack. The Focus EV will not be a 
plug-in series hybrid, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;extended-range electric 
vehicle,&rdquo; which carries a small engine on board to recharge the batteries 
on the fly. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need to plan your travels to get back to a 
plug before you use up the 100 miles worth of energy. Fully recharging could 
take from 6 to 12 hours, depending if you are using a 110-volt or 220-volt 
hookup. Ford is planning to introduce its own plug-in hybrid in 2012.</p> 
<p>The Ford Focus electric will use a single-speed transmission. The 
powertrain, including the motor and gearbox, are packaged under the hood where 
you would expect to see a gasoline engine.</p> 
<h2>The Back Story</h2> 
<p>Ford had been chatting with Magna about electric cars for a couple of 
years, when in 2008 Magna presented its electric car prototype to Ford 
engineers and executives. &quot;We took a look at that execution and said, 
'Hey, together we can really make this a proposition,&quot; said Nancy Gioia, 
Ford's Director of Sustainable Mobility Technologies.</p> 
<p>Five months later, Ford announced its intention to produce the car at the 
2009 Detroit Auto Show.</p> 
<p>Early reviews of the Focus EV pre-production vehicles have been 
positive&mdash;with kudos for brisk acceleration, top-notch build-quality, and 
handling and braking much better than your average pre-production car. When 
Michigan&rsquo;s Gov. Jennifer Granholm took a spin of the Focus EV at the 
Detroit Show, she was impressed. &ldquo;At first, she was surprised that it 
wasn&rsquo;t merely a concept car, but actually a road-ready demonstrator of 
battery electric vehicle technology,&rdquo; said Gioia. &ldquo;I think she was 
wowed by how it&rsquo;s quiet, smooth and fun to drive.&rdquo;</p> <br>

If the price comes in below $25K I can see a lot of commuters (like me) taking

<p>Nice idea, but it's strictly a commuter's car. My friend lives 65 miles 
away, so I can't make it round trip without re-charging. I'd have to recharge 
at his house and it would be on his utility bill. At least the 6-12 hour 
recharge time gives us the chance to drink a lot of good beer.</p> 
<p>Is this sort of car really governed by miles or some combination of miles 
and time? What if you commute is 40 miles each way, 80 miles total, under the 
100 mile limit. But you encounter terrible traffic and it takes you an extra 
hour to get home. Shut off the radio? Hope it doesn't get dark and you don't 
need the lights?</p> 
<p>Don't get me wrong. It's great to see this sort of car coming to the 
dealers. Too many EV's have been top end race cars and nothing for the family 
guy. I hope that this is a good step towards another EV's with greater range 
and quicker recharges.</p>

<p>I doubt a car stereo system could drain a 23kwh battery if it was left on 
for a week . I guess this car would be aimed at someone like me, who lives 
about 6 miles from work and rarely goes out of town. I normally put less than a 
hundred miles on the car in week.</p>

<p>Sure this car won't be fore everyone (only 90% of Americans live within 40 
miles of their work)</p> 
<p>But then it will be great for a lot of people, especially if we see another 
jump in prices at the pump between now and then.</p> 
<p>I think this car is ideal for a second car. My wife and I could have a 
Prius (or Ford Fusion Hybrid) as our &quot;main/long distance&quot; car, and 
this could be our around town commuter. We already have a car we only use 
around town, but unfortunately it runs on gas.</p> 
<p>As long as the price isn't too high (it's not like the car is going to get 
a bunch of points for styling) I think there will be plenty of interest.</p>

<p>I've always thought that most 2 car families(In the US thats the norm) 
could certainly have one car be an EV, if the other is a hybrid or PHEV then 
you get to a really good place as far as fuel consumption.<br>
 I think the 
Focus is the right size as well, let your other car be the larger station 
wagon/SUV/minivan/midsized sedan or whatever you think you need to accomodate 
your family on a trip, the EV is for commuting.<br>
 Go Ford! I hope the offer 
this in the Focus hatchback version as well.</p>

<p>They should just develop a removable set of 4-5 extended range batteries 
that they sell as an option. When going on long trips, you could just put them 
in your trunk. They would/could be pretty heavy, but if designed properly, they 
could be about 30lbs each or so, and modular. Just an idea to extend range when 
needed without adding unnecessary weight.</p>

<p>FamilyGuy,<br>
 You could always give your friend $2.00 and charge at his 
house. at 240 volts, 30 amps (standard dryer outlet power), you should be able 
to get the required extra 30 miles of range to get back home in 1 to 2 hours. 
That way you won't have to consume so much good beer that you can't drive back 
home safely.<br>
 Personally, I see this as the best news I've heard in some 
time. I just hope it comes true.<br>
 I saw a Ford Ranger Electric last week 
with NiMH batteries. It was produced in 1998 and is still running great with no 
maintenance except new tires. Ford definitely can make good vehicles if they 
put their minds to it.<br>
 I agree with all that the average family will 
probably want to keep an ICE, HEV, or PHEV as their 2nd car for longer road 
trips but this can significantly offset someones dependence on gasoline.</p>

<p>Cost is the million dollar question. Anything above 28k would not work 
unless they add a small ICE to extend the range. Lets say they can sell this 
for 28k along with a 4-6K Federal rebate and I believe you have a hit. But some 
will say why not just get a Yaris or Cobalt for 12-14K instead of spending 
22-24K for a EV commuter car. Excitement needs to be added w/ successful 
marketing to overcome some of these concerns. Again cost is extremely important 
here as battery costs, charge time, and mileage will need to improve for a 
majority of American's. Glad to see Ford move forward with this. The question 
in the short-term will be if consumers choice EV's or extended range hybrid 
plugins like the Volt. The cost to develop Volt types will be more than EV's 
but may reduce some concerns initially.</p>

<p>As the owner of a Prius hybrid gas/electric and a ZENN all electric 
vehicle, this Ford EV makes nothing but sense to me. My Prius has a 
sophisticated battery management system and the ZENN did not come with one. 
This makes all the difference in owning an electric vehicle. You save a few 
dollars by eliminating it and pay a whole lot when the batteries go bad early 
without it.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, car makers must focus on the decision at the time of 
purchase since it is nothing if they can't sell the car. So the purchase is 
made without a battery management system and then the customer is unhappy.</p> 
<p>People compare the original cost as if that was a fair comparison. If the 
lifetime cost of &quot;fuel&quot; is included, the electric car has a huge 
advantage, but we don't see that at up front when we are making the decision.
</p> 
<p>Now that Ford seems to be making sensible cars, let us hope that buyers 
will make sensible purchases. This will be great for us all!</p>

<p>I wonder if it is possible for the car to tow an itty-bitty gasoline 
generator behind it for long drives. My commute to work is only 6 miles (all 
around). My coven is a 60-mile round trip. So the only time this car would not 
suit my needs would be when I need to visit family out of state. I suppose I 
could get a rental for those 2-3 times per year, but towing a little generator 
would be better.</p>

<p>FamilyGuy:</p> 
<p>I appreciate and share some of your concerns. I don't think that this is 
finally the &quot;EV for everyone in every situation&quot;. However it is a 
significant step because if it lives up to the claims in this article, it will 
be the first EV on the market that is suitable for a very large number of 
people.</p> 
<p>Here's the thing. With a range of 100 miles, there are a tremendous number 
of people who can use it right now. I remember for a while now we've been 
hearing that some large percentage of the population -- certainly large enough 
to constitute a &quot;market&quot; -- commutes under 40 miles to work each way. 
I happen to fall into that category, so I could theoretically buy one of these 
cars to get back and forth to work, and to run most of my errands around town.
</p> 
<p>Still there are some things I can't use it for. It's around 60 or 70 miles 
one way to the airport for example, and one of my main sources of entertainment 
is a theme park that's a little farther. Similarly, my coworker who lives in 
another town 40 miles away may not be able to use it because it's just cutting 
it too close. So while the car will be a step in the right direction, it still 
isn't for everyone.</p> 
<p>However, getting them into the market begins to drive some other changes. 
My employer, or that theme park I was talking about, can now think about 
installing charging stations at some of their parking facilities. Maybe an 
enterprising private company starts rolling out a network of them around town. 
Think Better Place, but you don't have to use their car, and their battery, and 
that ridiculous &quot;cell phone&quot; model. Suddenly, driving my EV to the 
theme park (where I typically spend at least 6 or 8 hours at a time) is not out 
of the question. Similarly, the EV becomes a viable option for my coworker 
because now he can charge his vehicle while at work for the drive home. All 
this also expands the market for additional models from Ford as well as 
competitors. The implications of this vehicle could be pretty far-reaching, if 
they can get it to market at a price people will pay.</p>

switch to change on the fly from the vehicles batteries to the generator head 
in the towable trailer. the generator head in the trailer would be run off a 
V-Belt from one of the trailers wheels to the generator head thus supplying 
power without using any gasoline at all and extending trips 
indefinately............</p>

<p>This car is a start to try to convince people to move to all electric. I 
suspect, though, that it will not be very well received for families that have 
more than one driver; even if the drive to work is less than 30 miles. The 
problem with making it a family car is that if the wife wants to go to the 
store and then get her hair done and the teenager wants to use to go to the 
mall and then to a football game; by the time the husband leaves for his 
friend's house 60 miles away, he will not have a full charge. That senario does 
not have to play out too many times before the all electric &quot;family 
car&quot; is going to get a role change. If that battery pack drains before Dad 
can get back home, he will not be a happy camper. Which leads to another 
question, how will the different drivers in the family make the decision of who 
gets to go do their errands at the expense of the other.</p>

<p>hybridgreg, this is not rocket science. I don't know about you, but it 
would be pretty easy for me and my family to keep track of a typical weeks 
worth of errands. You might be surprised at 1. how much can be achieved in 100 
miles, 2. how long a car sits between errands. 3. how much of your travel 
occurs in short trips. In a 24 hr day, how long does your car sit in the 
garage/driveway vs. being driven? If one gets in the habit of treating it like 
their cell phone (plug it in whenever it's sitting around) it should always be 
&quot;topped off&quot;.</p> 
<p>Going to see a friend 60 miles away??? Is this really a typical scenario?

<p>Like I said, just a start. By the way, it may be difficult to get across to 
the layperson, but just because a full charge will take 6 or 12 hours (or 
whatever they said) doesn't mean that you drive your hundred miles and then are 
stranded somewhere for hours.</p> 
<p>EG, after my hypothetical 80-mile round-trip commute, even if I can't 
charge at work, I almost always am at home for an hour or two before going out 
to do anything for the evening. While I'm not going to get a full charge in 
that amount of time, I will certainly be able to add another 30 or 35 miles to 
the remaining range.</p> 
<p>It will be very interesting to see what Ford comes up with in the way of 
roadside assistance of the sort that you usually get with the first year of a 
new car. It's not like when you run out of gas, and they can drive up with a 
can of gasoline and give you enough to get to the gas station. I have no idea 
what they're planning or working on, but one option off the top of my head 
might be to have a small, replaceable auxiliary battery -- included with the 
car -- that could be easily swapped out for a fully charged unit and with 
enough juice to go 5 or 10 miles or so. Sort of like what Better Place is 
trying to do but since it would only be used in emergency situations, it would 
not have to be fully automated and all of that.</p>

<p>My little ZENN EV has a range of 35 miles on a charge. I carry an extension 
cord for the possibility that I might need a charge while I am away (most gas 
stations have a place to plug it). Even with many trips in a day, I have NEVER 
used this extension cord. It is simple. Part of my habit when parking in my 
garage is to plug it in. When I come out to drive the car for the next trip, 
the batteries have charged plenty.</p> 
<p>This turns out to be a non issue.</p> 
<p>Our travel patterns are pretty consistent. If it works, it works. If it 
won't work, its not for you or you need to reconsider your travel patterns. It 
is not rocket science.</p>

<p>Th next generation Ford Focus is going to be a HOT looking car. The current 
european Generation Ford Focus is a Show stopper and that is what the next 
golbal platform generation Focus will be based on. New Focus will likely look 
something like the crisp Iosis Max Concept that we were shown at this 
year&rsquo;s Geneva Motor Show. So there should be no problem as far as looks 
go.</p> 
<p>Add the EV option to what looks like a complete line up of 2-Door Coupe,

<p>Steve, the point is well taken. It will definately work for many. In terms 
of the &quot;60 miles to a friend to see a friend,&quot; I was noting Family 
Guys post. As Allen DeL said, he has never had a need to use his extension 
cord. So, maybe it is something that to consider, but not a game changer for a 
lot of people. I would like to think all-electric will be well received in the 
short term, but there is a compelling recent history of all-electric cars in 
the US to suggest that it might take a bit of convincing. Remembering that no 
single all-electric car offering has sold more that about 17,000 units in the 
US makes me think that we are a ways away from convincing the consumer. I want 
to be wrong on this, but time will tell.</p>

 It is true that electric

not far away. The real choice will be between a 3 mph horse and buggy and 
electric cars. The Ford Escort is a prototype that makes sense.</p>

<p>hybridgreg,<br>
 you said: &quot;Remembering that no single all-electric 
car offering has sold more that about 17,000 units in the US makes me think 
that we are a ways away from convincing the consumer.</p> 
<p>Your 17,000 number is way high but then again, no manufacturer has ever 
built more than about 1,200 all-electric cars and none ever allowed more than 
about 200 to even be put up for sale. Every single one of those cars found a 
recipient to lease it and there were thousands of people on the waiting lists.
</p> 
<p>EVs are the way to go if someone will actually make them and sell them. 
Time will tell but effort is needed to make it actually happen if we are going 
to have a future standard of living like that which we enjoy today.</p> 
<p>Hang in there Ford!</p> 
<p>fact check:<br>
 - Toyota allowed about 200 of their RAV4EVs to be sold for 
about 6 months in 2002 and around 100 each of Ford Ranger EVs and Chevy S10EVs 
were sold after they came off of fleet leases.<br>
 - The major auto 
manufacturers only released their 1990's EVs in a few dealers in very few 
states, predominantly California. GM initially denied any waiting lists but 
eventually admitted their existance.</p>

<p>This is easily the way to go for that second car, or the kids car. Airport 
has an &quot;airporter&quot; here so driving to the airport is a non issue 
here. Long trips are the only problem(ie 5000miles). Try train, flying, bus, or 
rental car. My hybred Ford escape does 10 miles/gallon better than the regular 
escape! But, not paying for gas is better. Remember that electricity is much 
cheeper after 11:00 PM. So a charge-up isn't mutch. When people find themselves 
saving a $100 every week or 2 with this- they will be sold.</p>

<p>Too much money to go 100 miles on a charge. If you are on the road, you 
will have to get a motel to wait for your battery to charge which will run the 
price up even more. Ford is throwing away money on this project. EVs should not 
be manufactured until someone comes up with a way to get long distance mileage 
out of them. Just another reason why this country is going down the tubes 
financially.</p>

<p>ex-EV1 Driver, I want to make a correction to your fact checking.</p> 
<p>There is one company that has produced and sold over 200 of a given EV, 
Tesla Motors. Now I know you are all gonna smash on me for this because, 
&quot;They are too expensive,&quot; &quot;It's not for the common man,&quot; 
etc. But, they have done it and they have turned a profit on the roadster. 
Plus, with plans to release a Model S for around 50k and then a vehicle after 
that for the same price range being discussed for these cars, it's a pretty 
bang up job.</p> 
<p>Right now they have over 500 Roadsters Delivered.<br>

<p>You could always get a Kill-a-Watt meter to plug the car into - that way 
you will know how much electricity your car consumed and can reimburse your 
friend. Even the maximum charge of 23kWh would only be around $2-$3, depending 
on power rates. That's a pretty cheap way to travel 100 miles.</p> 
<p>Despite the low per mile cost of energy for an EV, any cost savings vs. 
Gasoline will likely be eaten up when you replace the battery pack every 6-10 
years or so. The *real* savings in these vehicles will be maintenance. No 
tune-ups, rare - if ever - brake pad replacement, no oil changes. Even if you 
somehow wear out the motor, I imagine that could be replaced. King County 
Metro's electric trolley bus fleet is operating on 30+ year old electric motors 
that have been rebuilt and placed into new buses. Electric drivetrains last for 
a long, long, looooong time.</p> 
<p>Of course, since the car will last a long time, maybe we'll spend more 
money on wax jobs, body work, and other cosmetic maintenance... Who knows?</p>

<p>What the world needs is an electric car designed like a computer. A 
computer is a collection of generic modules that anybody can put together. If 
the battery is just one module, the 100 mile car can become a 200, 300, or 400 
mile car by changing the battery module. Better batteries are inevitable.</p>

The EV will do the same thing. I believe many people would appreciate these 
changes knowing that you will not be giving your money to the middle east. And 
by 2020 EV's will be able to go 500 miles before recharging. Imagine all of the 
money you will be saving for no more gas.</p>

<p>The range is an estimate likely by using either a EPA type city loop or 
some known average driving activity for a typical driver. The former is well 
defined and the latter is typically various speeds from 25-75MPH with a 40MPH 
average. Lets take an example, say the range is 100 miles going a constant 
60MPH. On most compact cars this works out to 160-200WH/mi which then means a 
16-20KWH battery. The reason why the Focus EV pack has a larger capacity is 
that LiFePO4 batteries last longer if they are not fully discharged every use. 
16/23KWH is about a 70% DOD (70% of the capacity is used). Now if you go just 
30MPH, you will use somewhere between 80-100WH/mi. That same 16KWH allows you 
to drive 200 miles.</p> 
<p>Now If fully discharged to 70%DOD every time, the battery will last 3,000 
cycles (full capacity drops to 18KWH). But that is 300K miles or about 20 years 
at the typical 15K miles/yr. But most will discharge it well below that at 
20-30% DOD where the battery will last 15K cycles or more (&gt;30 years). BTW 
at current retail prices, a 23KWH LiFePO4 battery costs about $6K. Fuel cost is 
8.7 cents per mile for a 30MPG combined compact car. At 300K miles, that is 
$26K. The 48,000KWH costs about $5.7K at residential prices. Even adding in the 
full cost of the battery (likely less as the cells can be remanufactured back 
to full capacity for a lot less than virgin stuff), the savings are $14K over 
the life of the battery. And that doesn't take into consideration consumables 
for gasoline engines which cost $200-300 a year in planned maintenance.</p>

<p>If Ford is Focusing on price they are on the right track. I would buy one 
of these tomorrow if the price was $25K or hopefully less. I almost never drive 
over 50 miles without an opportunity to recharge and I suspect most of the 
drivers in the country are not that different from me. The Volt will make an 
excellent primary car but who wants to spend $40K. If there is a tax incentive 
it should equally apply to all the electric cars. A Ford Focus EV at $25K with 
a $7500 tax incentive would outsell supply.</p>

<p>Finally, an EV which isn't a freak show. I will buy a discrete sedan EV

<p>I had an EV 20 years ago (ex airport stock, Suburu 600(?) van), which ran 
fine. The biggest drawback was people wanting to &quot;jawbone&quot; about it 
all the time. I took off the &quot;electric vehicle&quot; sticker to nip that 
in the bud.</p> 
<p>Will be interesting to see the final MSRP and how much the local dealers 
jack up the price with &quot;dealer mark up&quot;. When the Ford GT came out a

<p>One item he would confirm was that there would be none of the whole leasing 
and taking back of the electric cars that other companies are still infamous 
for.&quot;The Focus EV had enough torque to spin it's inside front wheel when 
accelerating through turns and provide ample power for brisk acceleration. The 
braking system switched between regenerative and regular braking smoothly with 
no noticeable hiccups throughout the process. The new Ford Focus electric car 
promises to travel 100 miles per charge from its lithium-ion battery pack, 
whose technology is several thousand dollars more expensive than its 
traditional gas propulsion system.<br>

<p>I've owned Toyotas since 1981. I was previously burned TWICE (not just 
once!) by Ford: in 73 with a Maverick that, for no apparent reason, liked to 
take unplanned &quot;furloughs&quot; after 20 minutes on the highway. Then I 
purchased a 76 Mercury Monarch that died a natural death on the highway 3 weeks 
after I bought it. I swore I'd never buy another Ford product. So I bought a 
Tercel in 77 and fell in love with Toyota.</p> 
<p>Now I'm ready to give Ford another chance, provided their EV is 
well-engineered and they price it realistically.</p> 
<p>My current Toyota has 130,000 trouble-free miles on it, and I'm planning to 
trade it in in 2011 or 2012. I'll follow Consumer Reports' ratings on the 
EV.....and if they're any good, I'll switch over to Ford one time. Then Ford 
will have to prove to me that I should stay with them.</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry too much about your friends' electric bills.</p> 
<p>Get yourself a 'Kill-A-Watt' (or equivalent) device to plug in with, 
assuming the car's charge controller doesn't have some sort of power meter 
(though it won't measure loss in the extension cord).</p> 
<p>When leaving, look at how many 'Kilowatt-hours' your charge consumed on 
your friends' outlet.</p> 
<p>Multiply that by the 'high' rate of their power bill. They can find out 
what that is on their statement, or online with their power company's web site. 
Usually around $0.14~$0.24 per KW/H.</p> 
<p>Multiply the electrical rate by number of kilowatts that you consumed while 
plugged in, during your visit. Round it up to the nearest $5.</p> 
<p>You could make a similar arrangement at work to let you 'top up' while 
there. They'd likely just comp it. Especially if your boss falls in love with 
electric car, too.</p>
