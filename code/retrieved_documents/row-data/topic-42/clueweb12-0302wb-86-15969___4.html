remarks <strong><br>
 Dearborn, Mich.,</strong> Aug. 22, 2011 &ndash; Ford 
Motor Company and Toyota Motor Corporation &ndash; the world&rsquo;s two 
leading manufacturers of hybrid vehicles &ndash; today announced they will 
equally collaborate on the development of an advanced new hybrid system for 
light truck and SUV customers. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>  Ford and Toyota have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the 
product development collaboration, with the formal agreement expected by next 
year.  &nbsp;  Both companies have been working independently on their own 
future-generation rear-wheel drive hybrid systems. The two now have committed 
to collaborate as equal partners on a new hybrid system for light trucks and 
SUVs. This new hybrid powertrain will bring the full hybrid experience of 
greater fuel efficiency to a new group of truck and SUV customers without 
compromising the capability they require in their vehicles.&nbsp;Ford and 
Toyota believe that their collaboration will allow them to bring these hybrid 
technologies to customers sooner and more affordably than either company could 
have accomplished alone.  &nbsp;  &ldquo;This agreement brings together the 
capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to 
develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our customers,&rdquo; 
said Derrick Kuzak, Ford group vice president, Global Product Development. 
&ldquo;Ford achieved a breakthrough with the Ford Fusion Hybrid, and we intend 
to do this again for a new group of truck and SUV buyers &ndash; customers we 
know very well.&rdquo;  &nbsp;  Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota executive vice 
president, Research &amp; Development, said: &ldquo;In 1997, we launched the 
first-generation Prius, the world&rsquo;s first mass-produced gasoline-electric 
hybrid. Since then, we have sold about 3.3 million hybrid vehicles. We expect 
to create exciting technologies that benefit society with Ford &ndash; and we 
can do so through the experience the two companies have in hybrid 
technology.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 The two companies also agreed to work together on 
enablers to complement each company&rsquo;s existing telematics platform 
standards, helping bring more Internet-based services and useful information to 
consumers globally.<br>
<br>
 Under the MOU agreement, the two companies will 
bring the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology 
and knowledge to a new co-developed hybrid system, which will be used in 
rear-wheel-drive light trucks arriving later this decade.&nbsp;Specifically, 
Ford and Toyota will:  &nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>Jointly develop as equal partners a new rear-wheel drive hybrid system and 
component technology for light trucks and SUVs</li> 
<li>Independently integrate the new hybrid system in their future vehicles 
separately</li> </ul>  For years, both Ford and Toyota have been working 
independently on similar new rear-wheel-drive hybrid systems aimed at 
delivering higher fuel economy in light trucks and SUVs. When the two companies 
began discussing this potential collaboration, they discovered how quickly they 
were able to find common ground.  &nbsp;  &ldquo;By working together, we will 
be able to serve our customers with the very best affordable, advanced 
powertrains, delivering even better fuel economy,&rdquo; said Ford President 
and CEO Alan Mulally. &ldquo;This is the kind of collaborative effort that is 
required to address the big global challenges of energy independence and 
environmental sustainability.&rdquo;  &nbsp;  Toyota President Akio Toyoda 
added: &ldquo;Toyota is extremely proud to join Ford in developing a hybrid 
system for pickup trucks and SUVs. Not only is this tie-up clearly one aimed at 
making automobiles ever better, it should also become an important building 
block for future mobility in the U.S. By building a global, long-term 
relationship with Ford, our desire is to be able to continue to provide people 
in America automobiles that exceed their expectations.&rdquo;  &nbsp;  This 
rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will be based on an all-new architecture to 
deliver the capability truck and SUV customers demand while providing greater 
fuel economy.  &nbsp;  While the rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will share 
significant common technology and components, Ford and Toyota will individually 
integrate the system into their own vehicles. Each company also will determine 
the calibration and performance dynamics characteristics of their respective 
light pickups and SUVs.  &nbsp;  In addition, as telematics plays an 
increasingly more important role in the in-car experience, both companies have 
agreed to collaborate on standards and technologies needed to enable a safer, 
more secure and more convenient in-car experience for next-generation 
telematics systems.&nbsp;The telematics collaboration relates only to standards 
and technologies, and each company will continue to separately develop their 
own in-vehicle products and features.  &nbsp;  &ldquo;Ford has made tremendous 
progress in the area of telematics,&rdquo; Kuzak said. &ldquo;We have unique 
and very good solutions today with SYNC and MyFordTouch. Working together on 
in-vehicle standards can only enhance our customers&rsquo; experience with 
their vehicles.&rdquo;  &nbsp;  Uchiyamada added <b>:</b> &ldquo;Toyota has 
also invested heavily in telematics in various countries around the world, with 
services like the G-BOOK and G-Link. In the U.S., we have just introduced the 
accessible, easy-to-use Entune. By sharing our know-how and experience, we 
would like to offer even better telematics services in the future.&rdquo;
