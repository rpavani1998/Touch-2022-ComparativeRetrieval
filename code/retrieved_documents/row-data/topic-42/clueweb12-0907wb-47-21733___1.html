<p>Conventional wisdom tells us hybrid versions of things, like the 2011 
Toyota Highlander Hybrid before us, don't make financial sense. Sure, the good 
ones use a lot less fuel than their conventional gasoline counterparts, but 
they cost more to buy, too.</p> 
<p>It can take serious time for gas savings to make up the difference. Our 
spreadsheets tell us that paybacks approaching 10 years are common. Some 
break-even points push laughingly past 20 years.</p> 
<p>Cold calculations are hard to argue with, but conventional wisdom is 
missing something.</p> 
<p><strong>Crossover Cross-Shoppers</strong><br>
 Say you're shopping along 
the border between minivans and crossover SUVs. That's pretty conventional. 
After all, they're called crossovers for a reason.</p> 
<p>You want a decent-sized third-row seat, if only to carpool kids to school 
and tote the in-laws to dinner when they visit. You'd take four-wheel drive if 
you could get it. But minivans are anything but &quot;mini&quot; these days 
&mdash; 200 inches long is the new norm &mdash; and only theToyota Sienna 
offers all-wheel drive. None are hybrids, which irks you a little.</p> 
<p>The 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid has a new 3.5-liter V6 engine and is 
rated at 28 mpg on the EPA's combined scale. It comes standard with a third-row 
seat. It has electrically operated 4WD. A Limited grade like ours starts at 
$43,755.</p> 
<p>Conventional wisdom would pit this against its V6 gasoline equivalent, the 
2011 Highlander Limited 4WD, which costs some $6,600 less. It consumes fuel at 
an average pace of 19 mpg. All of this boils down to an iffy hybrid payback 
time of 7.4 years.</p> 
<p>But since you're dithering between a crossover and a minivan, let's bring 
that AWD Sienna minivan back into the picture. We'll stick with the Limited 
grade to stay close on equipment. At $40,780, this Sienna starts out $2,975 
less than the Highlander Hybrid and has a rated fuel economy of 18 mpg.</p> 
<p>Compared to Toyota's minivan, the Highlander Hybrid break-even point 
approaches the 3-year mark. Savings kick in after that, especially if gas 
prices rise. If you're prepared to spend minivan money anyway, the 2011 Toyota 
Highlander Hybrid starts to make a kind of sense.</p> 
<p><strong>Why This Works</strong><br>
 This rational case for a hybrid 
crossover SUV only pencils out because the 2011 Highlander Hybrid has been 
substantially improved over the last year in certain crucial areas. Yes, we 
know; the sheet metal is essentially unchanged &mdash; this is a midcycle 
refresh, not an all-new generation. The key point here is that last year's 
3.3-liter V6 has been replaced with a stouter 3.5-liter V6.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Speed is all well and good, but the payoff in the cost equation comes from 
increased fuel economy.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Because of the hybrid application, this isn't the same 3.5-liter V6 that 
&quot;normal&quot; Highlanders have had for a few years. This one runs on the 
Atkinson cycle, a more fuel-efficient variant of the four-stroke cycle. The 
benefits only exist over a relatively narrow rpm band, but that's cool here 
because the hybrid continuously variable transmission (CVT) can more or less 
choose any ratio it needs to keep Mr. Atkinson in his happy place.</p> 
<p>Running by itself, this new engine peaks at 231 horsepower &mdash; 22 more 
than the old 3.3-liter. But there are electric motors in play, and they boost 
peak power to 280 hp &mdash; 10 more than the 2010 Highlander Hybrid's net 
rating. Meanwhile, the non-hybrid 2011 Highlander's non-Atkinson 3.5-liter V6 
still makes 270 hp.</p> 
<p>As you might expect, more total power makes the 2011 Toyota Highlander 
Hybrid quicker. It now scoots to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds (7.1with 1 foot of 
rollout as on a drag strip), a half-second speedier than the last one we tested
. The quarter-mile tells a similar story, where 15.4 seconds at 91.1 mph 
represents an improvement of 0.4 second.</p> 
<p>Speed is all well and good, but the payoff in the cost equation comes from 
increased fuel economy. Our 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid delivers this, too, 
thanks to the new engine and improved efficiencies in the hybrid drive system 
itself. The 2011 model's EPA city, highway and combined fuel economies are now 
all tied up at 28 mpg apiece. Last year's 3.3-liter Highlander Hybrid scored 26 
mpg combined, with 27 mpg coming from the city and only 25 mpg coming from 
highway driving.</p> 
<p><strong>Cargo Maximization With Three Rows</strong><br>
 All 2011 
Highlanders, hybrid or otherwise, now come standard with that third-row seat 
you want. But last year's seat had another problem: It was a one-piece 
all-or-nothing job when folding time came. Past Highlander owners sighed 
mightily and drove off in a huff every time they walked out of Costco with 
odd-shaped cargo.</p> 
<p>Not anymore. The new rearmost seat is now split 50/50 down the middle, so 
four can still ride with one-half of the second and third rows folded for those 
long items. What's more, handy second- and third-row release levers are found 
right there in the hatch area.</p> 
<p>We've always liked the Highlander's 40/20/40 second row. It reclines, it 
slides back and forth, and the central &quot;20&quot; section is removable (and 
stowable onboard) to create a center aisle and separate buckets with fold-down 
armrests. There are lots of clever ideas in here.</p> 
<p>With all rear seats folded flat, maximum cargo space is 94 cubic feet, with 
42.3 feet of that available behind the second row. Only 10.3 cubes are 
available behind the third row, but that jumps to 26.3 when one half is folded, 
as can now be done as of this year.</p> 
<p>Is there as much space as a minivan? No way. But this is still a decent 
amount to work with. Besides, if you're cross-shopping on the border, you're 
probably not 100 percent committed to the minivan concept and you're probably 
OK with this.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Sides of Other Coins</strong><br>
 With the same tires and 
suspension underneath, the 2011 Highlander Hybrid drives about the same as 
before. We observed the same impeccably smooth and quiet ride, reasonable 
coordination and modest limits as before. As if to underscore the point, it 
slithers through our slalom at 60.2 mph and pulls 0.77g on our skid pad.</p> 
<p>But the electric power steering is overly dead and lifeless. The Highlander 
Hybrid changes direction when we turn the wheel, but that's the only way to 
know it's connected to anything because there's precious little sensory 
feedback through the column. Bring your own pulse because you won't find one 
here.</p> 
<p>As expected, the regenerative braking system emits the same faint keening 
produced by every other Toyota hybrid. There's nothing wrong &mdash; that's 
just what it sounds like when it's doing its hybrid trick and plowing braking 
energy back into the battery. In a panic stop, the added contribution of 
four-wheel disc brakes stops the show in 120 feet from 60 mph &mdash; quite 
respectable for a crossover SUV riding on low-rolling-resistance tires.</p> 
<p>The aforementioned four-wheel-drive system isn't true four-wheel drive. The 
Highlander Hybrid is primarily a front-drive machine; the rear wheels are 
driven exclusively by another electric motor and there's no driveshaft 
connected to the transmission. Since the battery pack is small (this isn't a 
plug-in hybrid, after all), the amount of rear-drive assist is best imagined in 
tens of seconds, not tens of minutes. There's enough to get going from a 
slippery intersection &mdash; the system engages when and if front-wheel slip 
is detected &mdash; but the rear-drive unit is not built to produce a prolonged 
boost up a long, slippery hill.</p> 
<p><strong>Making Sense of Things</strong><br>
 This 2011 Toyota Highlander 
Hybrid Limited won over more fans than we expected during its short stay with 
us. One staffer's wife is already angling to trade her minivan in for one.</p> 
<p>And why not? The interior is flexible and comfortable, it finally has a 
useful third row and interior controls don't get any more logical or easier to 
use than these. It may not tickle the enthusiast's fancy, but the 2011 
Highlander Hybrid is a very well-rounded and well thought-out family crossover 
that just happens to be a 28-mpg hybrid.</p> 
<p>Need the maximum possible cargo space? OK, the 2011 Toyota Highlander 
Hybrid may not be for you. Have enough parking space for something 200 inches 
long? Great. There are plenty of other bigger choices out there. Not interested 
in the hybrid concept? That's fine &mdash; you can save money on the front end 
of the transaction and drive home happy.</p> 
<p>But we know that many of you are wavering between minivans and crossover 
SUVs. Some of you wish they were more hybrid choices. If you're going into this 
with a minivan budget but can make do with a little less size and space, the 
reworked 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid starts to make a good deal of sense.</p>

<p>10:44 AM, 06/08/2011</p> 
<p>I ended up buying a 2011 Highlander Hybrid at the end of March before 
prices went up and inventories disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sticker price was about 
5k more than a similarly equipped V6 base Highlander AWD with the tech 
package.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid $300 over invoice a the time which wasn't bad for a 
dark color, though I had seen white and silver going for less than invoice 
price when dealers had more on the lots.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the low supplies 
coming from Japan, high gas prices and the top rating from Consumer Reports, 
they are difficult to find right now, at least around Chicago.<br>
<br>
In my 
first tank I got just over 30mpg in 500 mixed city/highway miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
my second tank that was almost all driving around the suburbs with many short 
trips, it was 31 mpg over 500 miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer and actual were within 
a few tenths on both tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned already, no other 3-row 
vehicle with a V6 comes close to the overall fuel economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
closest I found were the 4-cylinder, 2WD versions of smaller SUVs like 
Outlander, Rav4 and Sorrento that get 10-15% less at 24-25 mpg 
overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2012 Mazda 5 is similar in size and also gets 24mpg 
overall and the same 28mpg highway as the Highlander Hybrid, but a bit worse 
even than those smaller SUVs around town at only 21mpg.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also 
lacks a V6 and AWD found on the Highlander Hybrid, though many people don't 
need either or those.<br>
<br>
I'm happy with the base model that had all the 
major features I wanted without stuff I didn't want, like moonroof, leather, 
power hatch, fake wood, auto climate, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;NHTSA and IIHS safety 
ratings are good all around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Backup cam and bluetooth with streaming 
audio are standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet and smooth ride, too.<br>
<br>
I'm found 
the HiHy to be somewhat undersized vs. competitive SUVs like Pilot, Flex or 
Acadia and maybe even the CX-9.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, the third row is barely 
big enough for small kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth works well, but the voice 
interface is cumbersome compared to other vehicles, as are things like 
importing contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;They did hit the front end of the hybrid with 
the ugly stick, but the rest of the van and interior look fine.</p> Report It

<p>I recently bought the 2011 Highlander Hybrid and have run 2 tanks of gas 
through it. It has been getting the reported 28 MPG as advertised in town. The 
best milage according to the display was 31.4. I have yet to tally up the real 
world figures with a calculator but am pretty sure they aren't too far off. The 
better milage I got was while in econ mode and of course keeping my foot out of 
the throttle except when really needed. My only concern so far for this car is 
wether the 4WD/AWD will be able to actually get me up the road from my driveway 
in the snow covered winter. My city doesnt plow my street until it hits the 
main road, and this systems seems a bit lacking. We'll see come winter how it 
does. I'll report back what I find.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>10:20 AM, 11/15/2010</p> 
<p>So...I bit the bullet and traded in my 2006 HiHy for a 2011 HiHy a few 
weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Pros: <br>
<br>
I'm getting 29MPG on the highway and 27 in 
the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing for a 7 passenger AWD vehicle.<br>
<br>
The Ipod 
and AUX integration works really well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The XM radio is also 
sweet...but given that I have an ipod with 30GB of music/books I doubt I'll 
shell out the $500 for a lifetime XM subscription.<br>
<br>
The new Nav systems 
does a much better job of telling you which lane to be in as highways and exits 
approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of times where the old system would 
say 'turn left' and what it really meant was &quot;the hwy is splitting, you 
want the left side BUT DON'T TAKE THE LEFT EXIT...too late&quot;<br>
<br>
The 
XM Traffic reporting is kind of cool...but it works on few roads (particularly 
compared to Acura/BMW/Audi) and costs $500 for five years (no lifetime is 
offered).&nbsp;&nbsp;So thats a no until the coverage dramatically improves or 
the cost dramatically drops.<br>
<br>
The backup camera is all too 
useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leads me to the Cons...<br>
<br>
Cons: <br>
<br>
The 
2011 HiHy is HUGE.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer a crossover and is now officially 
an SUV.&nbsp;&nbsp;It drives like a truck, has truck seats, and a truck 
interior.<br>
<br>
I hate how the equipment packages lay out - to get leather 
seats (a must for my wife) you have to get a jillion useless things (sunroof, 
power liftgate, accent lighting, etc.)<br>
<br>
And just a lot of little things 
that just scream &quot;1st year of new generation vehicle.&quot; For some 
unknown reason there are 3rd and 4th cupholders in between the driver and 
passenger and less storage. The 2nd row cupholders are no longer accessible by 
children. The heated seat controls which should be 'push/pull for on/off and 
spin for temp' are for some reason 'push/pull does nothing so you always have 
to spin to a new temp when you turn them on/off.'&nbsp;&nbsp; If the headlights 
are set to 'Auto' turning off the car or pressing the lock button on the remote 
doesn't turn off the lights (no matter what the manual says).&nbsp;&nbsp;Etc., 
etc.<br>
<br>
They couldn't be bothered to match the carpet and dash to the 
interior color.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the excess of chrome in the controls means that 
the 'Black/chrome/wood/beige' interior is WOW ugly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leads me 
to...<br>
<br>
Yes, bearsdkillz, they whacked this SUV with an ugly stick 
inside and out.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>We bought a new Base AWD Highlander last year with the 3.5L V6 engine. 
Yeah, I wish it had a few of the fancy options, like a backup camera and Bose 
sound system. But we paid just UNDER $30K before tax and license. Reading the 
prices in this review, that seems like a great deal now. I have no regrets. 
It's a great car. I don't understand why so many people in these comments bash 
the Highlander - I think it's pretty cool. The best CUV out there for under 
$50K.<br>
<br>
We've had a Pruis for the past six years, so we know what we're 
missing in terms of the Toyota hybrid experience. I wish we had the HiHy, but 
no way is it worth $15K more - or even $5K more. I'd pay $3K more.<br>
<br>
Our 
non-hybrid V6 Highlander also has a towing capacity of 5,000 lbs, which is 
1,500 more than the hybrid version. That's important to us, since we tow a 
modest-size trailer on summer trips.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Haven't done the hybrid, but just took a trip in a new '10 Limited AWD 
model up the CA coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spent four hours in it and aside from a few 
too many electrical assists and nannies (IMO) this is a very nice, 
well-powered, able handling, comfortable SUV at $34k OUT THE DOOR (that's a 
loaded Limited, folks).</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Anyone who thinks the HiHy is overpriced just isn't looking at the 
competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;What else out there seats 7, has AWD and gets decent 
mileage?&nbsp;&nbsp;That ideally can tow a small trailer?<br>

Chevy Tahoe

Ford Flex 
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18MPG mid $40,000s
<br><br>
Goodness knows I've been looking.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I drop the requirement 
for seating down to 5 than a few more choices pop up (e.g. the Subaru Outback 
2.5i - 24MPG low $30,000s) but even then it is only if I drop the requirement 
for AWD that can I get fuel economy better than the HiHy.<br>
<br>
It annoys me 
to no end - I love my 2006 HiHy but I detest the thought of having to ever deal 
with another Toyota dealership/service department again.<br>

You can get it loaded at 34180$ with leather, the V6 engine, ipod (USB),

Test Driver Ratings &amp; Comments <br>
Acceleration comments Surprisingly 
quick. This vehicle benefits when &quot;brake torqued&quot; because this forces 
the gasoline engine to start for a faster launch. CVT is obviously seamless and 
maximum electrical assist is indicated at 60 mph. Only a wisp of tirespin at 
launch with Trac off, so it might not be truly off or, more likely, it's 
getting a shove from the rear. <br>
Braking comments Highly susceptible to 
surface variations (dust/grit and small undulations) that produced 16-foot 
differences. Still, even at its longest, the Highlander stops as short as its 
peers. Some dive, but again, it's not horrible. <br>
Handling comments Skid 
pad: Steering lacks feel but build-up is appropriate. ESC &quot;off&quot; is 
not truly off, but in this mode intervention happens later, when understeer 
gets noticeable. With ESC on, the system starts closing throttle and dabbing 
brakes before understeer begins. Thankfully, the usual Toyota ESC 
&quot;beep-beeping&quot; is not present here. Slalom: With ESC &quot;off&quot; 
(it isn't truly), the Highlander Hybrid turns in crisply, but gentle understeer 
limits ultimate performance. Also, ESC goes berserk by the last gate, so timing 
it right makes a difference. Same results with ESC on, only slower. <br>
