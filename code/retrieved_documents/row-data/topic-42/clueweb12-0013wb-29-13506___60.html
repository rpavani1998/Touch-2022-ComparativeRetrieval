<h2>Child Poverty Is Down. No, it's Up</h2>

<p> Two reports on poverty in Canada were issued in November, each with 
strikingly different conclusions.One said less than six per cent of Canadian 
children live in poverty;the other said the poverty rate for Canadian children 
was more than three times that, over 17 per cent.</p> 
<p> How can that be?</p> 
<p> Well, one report was from the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think 
tank that primarily proposes competitive market solutions to social problems. 
The other was fromCampaign 2000, a national coalition of community 
organizations that is promoting an end to child poverty -- echoing an all-party 
resolution in 1989 to accomplish that goal by the year 2000.</p> 
<p> In issuing its number, the Fraser Institute celebrated the national 
poverty rate falling to the &quot;lowest level in history,&quot; just under 
five per cent. It called the number of children living in poverty, just under 
six per cent, a &quot;dramatic improvement.&quot; Not only were these numbers 
&quot;historically&quot; low, they also were much lower than rates of recent 
years.</p> 
<p> Campaign 2000 reported that child and family poverty rates have been 
&quot;entrenched&quot; at around 17-18 per cent for the last five years. And 
that the rate has never been below 15 per cent since 1989, the year the House 
of Commons resolved to end child poverty.</p> 
<p> <strong>Says who?</strong></p> <br>

<p> As you have probably guessed by now, the Fraser Institute and Campaign 
2000 define poverty very differently, and this leads to very contrasting 
interpretations of what it is to live in poverty in Canada. There is no 
official definition of poverty in Canada, due no doubt to the fact that the 
calculation of how many people live below the poverty level is contentious. But 
how different are their definitions?</p> 
<p> The measure used by Chris Sarlo of the Fraser Institute is a basic, 
bare-bones approach. Sarlo includes the cost of only what he considers the 
basic necessities for living. The cost of subsistence levels of food, clothing, 
housing, and a few other miscellaneous items are all that are included. For a 
family of four, this approach gives a figure of just under $23,000 as the 
poverty line.</p> 
<p> Campaign 2000 relies on Statistics Canada to provide the yardstick. Stats 
Can does not measure poverty. Instead it issues &quot;low income 
cut-offs,&quot; levels below which families would find themselves living in 
&quot;straitened circumstances&quot; because they would have to spend a greater 
portion of their income on basics such as food, clothing and shelter than does 
the average family of a similar size. Stats Can sets this line, for a family of 
four, at around $32,000.</p> 
<p> For comparison, Stat Can reported that the median level of income for 
households of two or more people was $54,000 in 2004. For two-parent families 
with children, the median income level was nearly $72,000.</p> 
<p> <strong>Generous deprivation</strong></p> 
<p> Neither the Fraser Institute nor Campaign 2000 can claim to have the 
&quot;right&quot; definition of poverty -- choices about what level of income 
constitutes a poverty line is a representation of values, goals and objectives. 
The Fraser Institute's rationale for its approach is that the Statistics Canada 
lines are too generous; they don't measure &quot;true deprivation,&quot; 
thereby misrepresenting the number of people in Canada that can truly be 
labelled poor or impoverished. Sarlo defends his basic approach by asserting 
that his income lines measure not being able to afford the basic necessities of 
life.</p> 
<p> Whatever the measure, there are too many poor people in Canada. By the 
measure of the Fraser Institute, we have more than 1.6 million Canadians -- 
hundreds of thousands of whom are children -- living in serious deprivation, 
conditions which are hazardous for health and development. One in every 18 
Canadian children is living in deep poverty in a country that finds itself so 
rich it can afford to put down over 13 billion dollars as payment on the 
national debt.</p> 
<p> Deep poverty is deprivation on an ongoing basis. It is not missing out for 
a month when funds are short. It is about not having money to participate in 
our society, period. And who is deprived in our country? In particular, people 
of colour and First Nations families. How else can we explain the overwhelming 
evidence that both First Nations and immigrants are disproportionately poor 
except by systemic discrimination?</p> 
<p> <strong>Canadian underclasses?</strong></p> 
<p> But reserves are not the only holding places for the poor. Steep housing 
costs in the major urban centres of Canada are a big reason we have an ongoing 
class of poor children in our country. Here in Canada, we prefer not to look in 
the face of poverty nor admit that we have conditions that rival the Third 
World on our reserves and in our cities and towns.</p> 
<p> While we pay down the national debt, we are running up a <em>poverty</em> 
debt that will sink the next generation. Rather than worrying about the next 
generation's fiscal debt load, we should be worrying that there will be a next 
generation that can work and participate as Canadian citizens. Living in 
poverty reduces both expectations for health and getting a job.</p> 
<p> The poverty debt can be directly addressed through Canada's National Child 
Benefit. Raising the amount of the benefit for families with children provides 
immediate relief and lifts children out of deep and destructive poverty. Their 
parents also need help to be included in an economy that has been shedding 
unskilled workers. Parents need jobs that will support families. CPRN's study
<em>Too Many Left Behind</em> found that nine million workers had not attained 
literacy levels that are expected of a productive worker. Canada needs to raise 
the skill level of our workers to be competitive in the new knowledge economy.
</p> 
<p> Forget about the ongoing debate about the measurement of poverty. That 
isn't the problem. The big problem is that we have too many poor children -- by 
any measure.</p>

<h3>Comments on &quot;Child Poverty Is Down. No, it's Up&quot;</h3> 
<p>I have one paramount wish for 2007. That all the directors, fellows and 
founders of the Fraser Institute would be forced to live on no more than 
$23,000.00 for the year - adjusted pro rata to reflect whatever size family 
they happen to have. If they own a house that they should have to move out of 
it for the year, that if they have a car that they give it up for the year, 
that if they have a child in a post-secondary institution that they have to 
withdraw for the year. And that they should bear, mutatis mutandis, the slings 
and arrows of outrageous fortune that every family with an income of $23,000. 
has to bear in this city - for just one year.</p> </li>

<p>Great article.</p> 
<p>The Fraser Institute is once again issuing nonsense that is totally 
divorced from the bare realities on the ground. There are not infrequent 
moments when they are an embarassment to conservatism.</p> 
<p>I can dimly remember when a similar benchmark for poverty was issued back 
in the early nineties...It encountered the same issues regarding the definition 
of poverty. And I explicitly recall that the Carleton School of Social Work had 
a field day dissecting the prescribed budget....it apparently had neglected 
such basics as sanitary napkins and disposable diapers, and basically left no 
room whatsoever for anything we might associate with a liveable quality of life 
in modern society.</p> 
<p>And needs have changed now too. For example, you could put forward a good 
argument for why internet access should be an essential service alongside 
telephone and hydro. And with people spending more and more time commuting to 
jobs they can't afford to live near, with little time to pick up the kids, let 
alone cook for them, then cell phones have become pretty indispensable too. And 
lots of families have to rely on pre-prepared packaged foods, which further 
adds to costs....the list goes on.</p> 
<p>And all this sets aside the importance of an optimistic future in promoting 
socio-economic participation. A family on $23K or less has no margin to improve 
its circumstances. They probably have little or no access to credit (relative 
access to which now effectively defines first- and second-class citizens). 
Which means their kids had better be brilliant and then just *maybe* they'll 
get someplace (but only if they can avoid the multiplicity of pitfalls and 
life-changing distractions that await kids from low-income backgrounds).</p> 
<p>Without an optimistic future to work towards, what will dissuade kids from 
making fast cash on the streets? Why be a sucker and work for an unjustifiable 
&quot;training wage&quot; when you can cold cash doing a wide variety of 
illegitimate activities, and get some respect doing it? The so-called training 
wage teaches kids one thing: that their first experience participating in the 
legimate workplace is a rip-off. They know it.</p> </li>

<p>I would like to extend a challenge to Chris Salo of the Fraser Institute: 
Open an ING account, deposit $23,000 and see how far that gets him living here 
in Lotus Land. Of course that's for the family of four, if he's on his own I 
think half, 11,500, is more than fair. Go on Chris! It would be a true 
character builder!</p> 
<p>P.S. I get the $13 ING offers for referals right?</p> </li>

<p>In a Fraser Institute world, the poor are to be kept in poorhouses, 
children sold off for indentured labour. In a Frase Institute worls, the poor 
are poor and the wealthy are supreme.</p> 
<p>The truth in Canada is very sad. We treat children extremely poorly. We 
hardly give them an education; we hardly let them achieve in sport; we do not 
train them for the real world.<br>
 Instead we throw billions in bureaucratic 
top heavy programs, that have little or no meaning.</p> 
<p>Sadly we are letting our future generations down and do not think for one 
instant that tday's children do not know this!</p> 
<p>Canada will reap the whirlwind of our beggerdly treatment of children.</p>

<p>The Fraser is a corporate advertising agency. Instead of selling cars and 
soap, they sell lies. But then so are all the economics departments in our 
universities, brainwsshing students with the neoclassical crap, now fully 
accepted by all political parties.</p> 
<p>They also list themselves as a &quot;tax deductible, non profit charitable 
institution&quot;. At $25,000 per membership.</p> 
<p>You can live very well on $23,000. out in the country if you're set up for 
a great degree of &quot;non competitive&quot; self sufficiency. We're doing it 
and have been for many years. But this doesn't jack up the GDP, so the 
government is forcing people off the land and into the cities, where living 
cost are multiplied, which they can report as &quot;growth of the GDP&quot;.</p>
<p>The GDP is a fraudulent statistic. It can go sky high, while people are 
homeless and starving in the streets.</p> 
<p>Also, a competitive market economy not only doesn't solve poverty, but 
increases it, because all forms of competition increase energy inputs, which 
jack up prices. Now prices are going up in the stores every day to &quot;remain 
competitive&quot;, which means more profits for the inveestors.</p> 
<p>Since the FTA in 1989, living costs went up at least 500%, yet it was 
supposed to lower costs and every time we go into a supermarket, we find higher 
prices, leapfrogging each other between stores.</p> 
<p>But then, this is what we pay for &quot;growth&quot; and 
&quot;productivity&quot;.</p>

<p>The Fraser Institute has never done a study on public transit or such and 
the reason why is quite simple.</p> 
<p>In BC, Quebec, and Ontario, mass transit projects are built, not to ease 
congestion or provide better public transit, but as a vehicle to put taxpayer's 
money into political supporters pockets, legally.</p> 
<p>This is how it works - politicians decide that a transit projects should go 
from A to B. Costs range from $500 million to $1.2 billion. After much media 
hype and sham public consultation, the $1.2 billion transit option is chosen, 
but wait........the once $1.2 billion option is now $2.3 billion! All that 
extra taxpayer's money flowing into supporters of the government, massive 
profits at the expense of the taxpayer, all leagal!</p> 
<p>You will never see the Fraser Institute do a report on RAV!</p> 
<p>Now when it comes to the poor and poor children, they have no such media 
advocates, no powerful 'old boys/girls lobby in Ottawa and are easy targets for 
the Fraser Institute. They like bashing the poor, the elderly, and the lame 
because it is easy and they do not pay their salaries!</p> 
<p>As an aside, to those who, who tend to know my interests. i have issued a 
challange to Faisal Mazur, Fraser Institute fellow and I believe business 
editor for the Sun to debate RAV and the ecconomics of metro versus LRT, to 
date, he has not accepted this challange. Why? Simply, on an ecconomic basis, 
RAV/metro is not viable and he knows that. It just so easy for the Fraser 
Institute to crap all over the disavantaged!</p> </li>

<p>Thanks for this timely article, Sharon Mason Singer and David Hay. I 
believe it is good to start the year by focusing on the needs our cold and 
hungry people.</p> 
<p>I just looked up the MSP premium subsidies for low income people and found 
that the people ($23,000 - family of 4) listed as impoverished by the Fraser 
Institute qualify for a 40% reduction on their premiums. They still must pay 
$43 a month for medical insurance. How can this be? The Fraser institute's 
figures are not harmonized with the BC Liberal government's heath care plan! 
It's an outrage! I'm sure if they put their accountants to work, the Good Ole 
Boys network should be able to find a way to show that the poverty line is 
actually at $20,000 so those people will require no subsidies at all.</p> 
<p>What a load of manure - $25,000 tax-deductible membership in an 
organisation that tells families earning $23,000 or more they are not poor - Ed 
Deak and his workable rural economic plan not-withstanding (for even in rural 
BC, a piece of land large enough to do any bit of farming is $250,000 with a 
50% downpayment required for bare land.)</p> 
<p>It is nice to read that everyone thus far replying to this article is on 
the same side. AMEN</p> </li>

<p>Canadians have no idea of what real poverty is. Even the &quot;poor&quot; 
here live vastly better than about any nation on earth.</p> 
<p>Can a family of four live in $23,000? Sure it can (especially with the CCTB 
which would run about $500 for the two kids). I have done it in the past with 
equilavent amounts when I was starting out. It just means budgeting your money.

<p>Sharing.... the high land costs are the direct result of so called 
&quot;wealth creating foreign investment&quot;, which is nothing more than the 
inflation of another country's money supply. Now added to with the 1991 secret 
deregulation of the private banks' money creating powers.</p> 
<p>The inflaton started in the early 90s, when land prices here in the Cariboo 
went up 1000% overnight with the inpour of German and Swiss monies. It has gone 
down since, but now it is fuled again by Americans and Canadians who realize 
that the US dollar is dead and our monetary system is hanging by a thread and 
may fall at any day.</p> 
<p>Now add to this the recently announced plan of China to divest themselves 
of their $3.2 trillion of worthless US dollars. How much of this will be coming 
to Canada, buying up more land, welcomed by our idiot politicians and 
economists, while our own people are forced into city shoeboxes?</p> 
<p>Like I've seen an economist, by the name of Lang saying on CBCTV: &quot;We 
must subsidize the farmers to get them off the land&quot;</p>

 I'd suggest the 23,000 includes the child tax benefit and 
Harper's pander for kids under 6. But it really doesn't matter what you think.
</p> 
<p>Poverty is always a relative measure - your point about other cultures is 
meaningless. Families of 4 making a lot more than 23,000/annum in Vancouver are 
desperately poor. This is where Canadians actually live and this is where 
addressing the problem is not a priority, period.</p> 
<p>And, if such a family were receiving any provincial social benefits they'd 
be even worse off because the claw back would eat up any gains they were able 
to make from an earned income point of view.</p> 
<p>If you survived for a year or so on equivalent pro rata amounts, you were 
desperately poor and the fact you have no empathy for someone in a similar 
situation with two young children tells us less about poverty than it does 
about you.</p>

<p>Ed, I'm with you 100%. I was just saying that you were able to purchase 
land 23 years ago. Now, a poor family has difficulty purchasing that same land 
that you were able to buy because the cost of real estate has increased faster 
than what $23,000 wages can afford. Granted, poor families can rent homes for 
less in the Interior, but until they put in a garden with good soil (and buy 
rakes and shovels hoses - canning equipment) they are going to have a higher 
food bill than in the lower mainland. Groceries are much higher in the 
Interior, as are heating bills.</p> </li>

<p>Hi Ed, <br>
 I live in the Interior, and I know of no habitable houses on 
lots of 2 acres or more that sell for less than $250,000. Empty lots on larger 
parcels require developing water hydro and seweage treatment - generally, a 
$30,000 to $50,000 up front cost. Yes, a person can generate electricity and 
use an outhouse and use a dug well and rainwater until they get on their feet, 
but poor families are often living hand to mouth making improvement difficult. 
This often leads to social/addiction issues that relate to poverty and lack of 
self-esteem. That said, I firmly believe people can grow a decent garden even 
on a 1/4 acre lot (with a modest home) if they employ good intensive gardening 
practices.</p> 
<p>Perhaps near you land is cheaper, but is there stable employment? Where I 
live, much of the employment has always been seasonal and linked to the world 
commodities markets - often resulting in as much as 40% unemployment. Hard to 
buy anything without an income. Not many are as hard-working and resourceful as 
you have proven to be, Ed.</p> 
<p>20 years ago, I read a study about (then contemporary) hunter-gatherer 
societies. The average hunter-gatherer adult (on five continents) spent 2.8 
hours per day making his or her living. This included food preparation, house 
building, clothing making etc. We have become foolish over-consumers who have 
forgotten how to live with nature. We don't teach our children how to farm and 
fix things. We have traded self-sufficiency for paycheques and we have given 
away our resources in exchange for those paycheques. We allow the government to 
sell off our resources in huge chunks to huge multi-nationals who have no 
interest in our welfare.</p>

<p>SIG..... Prices are a bit lower here in the Williams Lake area and here we 
have a couple of roaring copper mines that pay<br>
 very well, for 10 days of 
12 hour shifts.</p> 
<p>We can see a continuous traffic of ore trucks on the mainroads, taking BC's 
wealth abroad. Each of those trucks carries half million $ worth of ore.</p> 
<p>Overloaded, even at breakup, they pay millions in fines to the government, 
I've heard $10 million a year by Polley Mtn alone, breaking up the roads, 
without repairs, going to hell. There are deep ruts in the pavements, while the 
government is giving them taxbreaks so they can take out more.</p> 
<p>Of course, when you look at house and even apartment prices on the Lower 
Mainland, $250,000 is very cheap.</p> 
<p>We bought our 120 acres for $30,000 in 1975 and gave it away last year to

<p>Hughes, you're too generous. According to Sarlo's calculations, a single 
person isn't living in poverty unless his/her income is at or below 10,314; 
your 11,500 would place him in the middle class.</p> 
<p>Working man: &quot;Canadians have no idea of what real poverty is. Even the 
'poor' here live vastly better than about any nation on earth.&quot;</p> 
<p>WISE did a study on women living in poverty (yes, they qualified even under 
Sarlo's definitions). Among the participants were women who had experienced 
poverty in different lands. The following are excerpts from the story of one of 
the women:</p> 
<p>&quot;Born and raised in the Caribbean, I can identify with the poverty 
Haiti goes through. I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to go into the garbage 
dumps and scramble for food. I was able to go to the banana tree and cut a 
bunch of bananas, or dig the soil and get yams, or pick a fresh mango from the 
tree. But pain is pain. If our lives are threatened, from living out of the 
dumpster or from having to stand on the streets of Vancouver to do 
prostitution, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s still pain. The difference with North 
America is that poverty is hidden. We can live in an apartment and in a house 
or in a setting where we can mask that poverty. People really 
don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t take the time to get to know you, to know how 
you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re struggling. People in the community, 
they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve stopped supporting each other and the village no 
longer raises the child...</p> 
<p>&quot;Here, people without gardens must go to grocery stores. 
That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s how the corporations have taken over. It used to be 
that people would make cherry pies or vegetable dishes or whatever. They were 
able to sell that to the neighbours and they would survive that way. Now there 
are all types of liability issues and insurance and licensing 
and&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; When you look at all these big manufacturers, what are 
they doing but making that very same pie and earning millions and billions in 
revenue and profit? They&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve managed to take away the very 
essence of life in terms of how we survive, and turned it into a multi-billion 
dollar business. The pie that we get at the grocery store now is less 
nutritious and has no value and no meaning. In fact, we cannot afford the pie 
anymore.&quot;</p> 
<p>Relative poverty, or income inequality, matters, particularly because the 
upper tier of income earners dictate in terms of their actions and inactions 
how any given society is structured. The greater the inequality of income, the 
greater the exclusion both in depth and scope. Where fewer and fewer citizens 
are enabled to participate in society, democracy is threatened.</p>

<p>Statistics Canada is well aware of the criticisms from Sarlo and others 
about their &quot;relative&quot; measure of low-income (Low Income Cut-Off or 
LICO). StatsCan is developing a &quot;Market Basket Measure&quot; (MBM) based 
on a theoretical &quot;basket&quot; of goods needed to survive at a basic level 
in our society. This is roughly what Sarlo does, but Sarlo thinks the MBM is 
too generous because it includes things like video rentals:<br>

http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/chapterfiles/The%20Market%20Basket%20Measure%20of%20Poverty-Sarlo.pdf
</p> 
<p>I think the key finding is that in 2000 the number of children in poverty, 
as measured by the MBM, was actually slightly *higher* than the number below 
the LICO.</p> 
<p>http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/cs/comm/news/2003/030527.shtml</p> 
<p>I haven't followed up on this recently so I don't know what the current MBM 
vs. LICO levels are - and I don't have enough time to look it up right now!</p>

<blockquote> Instead it issues &quot;low income cut-offs,&quot; levels below 
which families would find themselves living in &quot;straitened 
circumstances&quot; because they would have to spend a greater portion of their 
income on basics such as food, clothing and shelter than does the average 
family of a similar size. Stats Can sets this line, for a family of four, at 
around $32,000.</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Once again Fraser Institute gets it right. If you read this, the 
definition, in itself does not equate to poverty. Rather, it equates to 
&quot;financially strained&quot;.</p> 
<p>Regardless, we are arguing semantics here. It should say that only 5% of 
Canadian families live below the poverty line, however another 10% live two 
paycheques away from it.</p> 
<p>Fraser Institute is telling the truth, though it is still misleading. 
Campaign 2000 is flat out manipulating the numbers, but accurately 
demonstrating that many families live in less than comfortable circumstances. 
Obviously, when you attach the word &quot;poverty&quot; - you command more 
attention.</p> 
<p>I am also interested to see if Cost of Living has been considered. You can 
live somewhat comfortably in Trail - with 32K per year. In Vancouver, it is a

<p>Much of the problem around this discussion is that poverty is an 
emotionally loaded term that has no agreed-upon definition (thus the 
&quot;debate&quot; around the Fraser Institute's stats.) And in Canada it is 
largely a relative term -- you are poor if you do not have as much as your 
neighbours.</p> 
<p>This makes sense inasmuch as this puts you (and children especially) at a 
disadvantage in participating in your community and in society.</p> 
<p>But I don't think that Canadians (or even Tyee readers, clealry) have an 
agreement on what kind of minimum lifestyle people should expect to be able to 
lead.</p> 
<p>It is true that many people have lost the homemaking and handyperson skills 
necessary for living on less. And people in poverty have often experienced some 
kind of family or community rupture at some point in their lives that made it 
even more difficult to gain those skills.</p> </li>

<p>When schools do not give you an education or job training, you will fail 
and unless one wins a lottery or inherits money, you will be poor.</p> 
<p>One thing I learned on my many travels in Europe, is that the education 
system, for bad or worse, did straem people into job training and 
apprenticeships. No so here.</p> 
<p>BC and Canada, run education mills, churning out students by the thousands, 
with worthless paper. Even the universities have become education mills, 
churning out worthless degrees. What a good degree, then spand another $50 
thousand and presto, you will get one!</p> 
<p>I have yet to find a planner or engineer that knows more about LRT than me, 
which is a very sad comment indeed, as modern LRT has proven to be a tool in 
reducing traffic, etc., but that is another story.</p> 
<p>What the hell did he study in university? They may have a degree but they 
are not educated, not by a long shot!</p> 
<p>But back to child poverty, we are exacerbating the situation by not 
training children to work, to get a job. Oh no, can't stream little Johny into 
technical school. It sad how we waste todays and tommorrows talent, by not 
giving the kids a chance!</p> 
<p>It is my firm belief that to graduate from highschool, one must have a 1st 
year in university or technical coledge or a 1st year in an apprenticeship. If 
we did that, poverty would drop considerably.</p>

<p>Grumpy - Your observations on the education system are on the mark. That's 
certainly my summation, I've got a special place where I keep all my pieces of 
papers and other assorted &quot;smart stamps&quot;. I've got another special 
place where I place my updates on my interminable student loan payments. By 
rights, I should be able to trade in all those papers for a high-end Mercedes, 
or a nice starter condo (well, okay, not in Vancouver...) but it ain't so. 
Those papers are not a commodity you can re-sell or trade in, and in spite of 
our rhetoric they actually doesn't appreciate in value all that well over time 
either.</p> 
<p>I can say with a reasonable amount of confidence that everything I learned 
after, say, grade six, I pretty much taught myself. All the tuition payments 
did was buy me time, and perhaps a little bit of structure and exposure. It 
hardly warrants a decade of time and that much money. It's an inefficient 
profit mill...and not about the students at all. I've said it before and I'll 
say it again - hand the liberal arts post-secondary education system back to 
the Dominicans and the Jesuits, and you might actually get some results (for a 
fractions of the price, seeing as they don't accept salaries). The sciences are 
doing just fine, however.</p> 
<p>RickW - the RC Church is doing more than any other internaitonal 
organization, religious or otherwise, to alleviate child poverty in the 
world....They feed and clothe more kids worldwide than the U.N. And 
exponentially so, at that. But I knew someone would bite tho... ;-)</p> </li>

<p> No we don't. Canadians like most humans labour under the illusion that 
there is some kind of lack or scarcity in this world, a very understandable

an obscene share of our wealth, and we give it to them via debt-slavery.</p>

<p>I grew up in a strict religion etc. but have left it long ago.</p> 
<p>My main objection was, and still is, the political involvement of religions 
in politics, often in the weirdest ones, like the nazis.</p> 
<p>Hitler would never have become anything without the support of the 
Lutheran, Calvinist and Catholic Churches. Of course, there have been 
exeptions, some bishops, priests and the famed Pastor Niemoller in KZ camps, 
but the main body supported Hitler on Biblical grounds, as the &quot;Leader 
with the cross on his chest&quot; who punished the Jews for the crucifiction.
</p> 
<p>All Wehrmacht units and most of the Waffen SS have been supplied with 
clergy by the Churches, as padres, with officer ranks. After the war I knew 2

<p>My original point was merely that the Vatican was the only significant 
international body to condemn the execution and the images. That's all. It's 
consistent with their long-standing criticism of U.S. policy in the region from 
the get-go. We can debate the middle ages if you want to, but... ;-)</p> 
<p>I don't want to take this thread too far off course...But there's some 
factual glosses that bear correcting. No one emerged from WWII smelling 
particularly pretty, but the RC Church did *not* support Hitler. Many of the 
Protestant Churches were viciferously supportive of Hitler and his ideology, 
for a variety of reasons. Catholicism's resistance to Hitler stems in part from 
its institutional rigidity and also from the fact that German RC's had always 
been an alienated, and not infrequently persecuted, minority in Germany 
(remember Bismarck's Kulturkampf). That's not to say there weren't some 
stinkers in the bunch. But by and large the RC minority in Germany tended to be 
more resistant to the allure of Hitler than the Protestant congregations. 
Protestantism is, of course, in part a rejection of the Judaic roots of our 
culture, so it carries that baggage with it as well.</p> 
<p>And love it or hate it, the RC's do indeed feed and clothe more kids in the 
developing world than any other human agency I'm aware of.</p> 
<p>One more point: &quot;The Church&quot; traditionally refers to the people 
(like the muslim word &quot;Umma&quot;), not the hierarchy. All hierarchies, 
irrespective of creed or ideology, manifest at least some of the flaws 
described in The Corporation. It's the nature of the beast...that is to say, 
it's the nature of human beings interacting in organized or semi-organized 
groups.</p> </li>

<p>Well, you can be certain that any remedy proposed by the Fraser Institute 
will be as effective as a placebo. It will reassure those already convinced of 
its ideological correctness, while doing nothing for the actual issue at hand. 
That's all they're really aiming for, if truth be told.</p> 
<p>The issue is much bigger than simply where we place the benchmark for 
&quot;poverty&quot;. It's about the way that benchmark follows people and 
families throughout their lives and through the generations. It's about the 
psychological and emotional impact on children who see every day that they have 
less than others, and know that they are automatically relegated to a different 
and lower rung because of it. I wonder how the Fraser Institute would remedy 
these intangible legacies of chronic inequity?</p> </li>

<p>In many parts of B.C., $10,000 will buy enough land to be self-sufficient. 
Trouble is that even if you install a composting toilet, anaerobic digester, or 
various other technologies that are much better for the environment than a

<p>Definitely. If I spend 5 minutes fixing my own leaky tap, that adds nothing 
to the GDP. On the other hand, if I take time off work, ride a huge diesel bus 
back home, wait for a plumber to drive his big diesel truck to my home to spend 
5 minutes fixing the tap, then ride a huge diesel bus back to work again, 
that's supposed to add to the GDP. Mostly it adds to the financial wealth of 
motor vehicle manufacturers, road builders and oil companies. The extra taxes 
the government gets from the plumber are cancelled out by them getting less 
taxes out of me because of the time I take off work. The extra taxes collected 
on the diesel burned in the plumber's truck are more than cancelled out by 
extra health care costs attributable to the diesel exhaust, road construction 
costs, etc.</p>

<p>The head of Home Depot Inc. left the home improvement chain on Wednesday in 
a mutual agreement, taking with him a severance package worth about $210 
million US.</p> 
<p>The surprise departure of Bob Nardelli from the role of chief executive 
officer after six years came amid investor unhappiness over Home Depot's share 
price performance. Nardelli also stepped down as chairman of the board.<br>
 
Home Depot chief executive and chairman Bob Nardelli, pictured here, resigned 
as chairman and chief executive on Jan. 3. The decision was by mutual 
agreement, the Atlanta-based company said.<br>
 (Ric Feld/Associated Press) </p>
<p>Under Nardelli's employment agreement, he will leave the company with a 
massive severance deal, including a cash payment of $20 million US, the 
acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently worth about $77 
million US, and unvested options with an intrinsic value of about $7 million US.
</p> 
<p>Nardelli has agreed not to compete with the company for one year, not to 
solicit employees or customers of Home Depot for four years, and other 
conditions, the company said in a release.</p> 
<p>The departure of Nardelli has come just four months after he told the 
Associated Press that he had no plans to depart.</p> 
<p>Nardelli was replaced immediately by Frank Blake, the company's 
vice-chairman.<br>

<p>flyingfish - </p> 
<p>It's a point that bears repeating.</p> 
<p>If we're going to exert all this effort to indoctrinate an inexperienced 18 
year old in the idea of borrowing $40-$60K over the next 3-4 years (not 
counting additional borrowing for post-graduate education), so they can subsize 
our post-secondary diploma mill (without guaranteeing outcomes), then the least 
we can do is be honest about expectations and results.</p> 
<p>I'm actually appalled at some of the jobs I've observed for which the 
requested level of education was an MA (i.e. about six years of university, 
after high school), but whichactually only combined the practical functioning 
of agrade 10  education along with an adult level of maturity (socialization, 
self-discipline, deferred gratification, emotional maturity/stability, etc.).
</p> 
<p>It's an extremely wasteful system, and except for certain crucial pockets 
in the technical, scientific and some professional fields, it hasn't 
necessarily produced a more educated or qualified workforce.</p> </li>

<p></p> 
<p>And those are the naturalized english-speaking Canadian ones...</p> 
<p>The problem only gets worse in the college system (esp. in urban areas), 
which has been watered down academically over the past 15 years in order to 
function as vehicles for the integration of new immigrants. One year programs 
are now two or three; two year programs are now four. Same material; double the 
time, quintuple the cost. Governments have offloaded integration and ESL costs 
onto the students (and simultaneously offloaded the unremunerated burden of 
responsibility onto the beleagered college faculty). By the late nineties, up 
to 80% of my dad's physics and math classes couldn't pass a basic ESL test if 
their lives depended on it. It created a situation whereby faculty were 
pressured by enrollment-conscious administrators to pass underqualified 
students and harvest more tuition, while 'naturalized' (I hate that word, but 
it's the accepted terminology) Canadian students of community colleges were 
stuck in a swampland of remedial, literally &quot;retarded&quot; (in an 
educational sense) courses overcrowded with underqualified peers with little to 
no functioning language skills in the language of instruction.</p> 
<p>The universities, on the other hand, were able to build firewalls against 
this kind of cooptation by political exigencies, while skimming the cream of 
the foreign student crop in order to harvest their massive tuition fees 
(foreign students in Canadian universities pay between 3-5 times the going rate 
for Canadian citizens, hence to drive to pack classrooms with the 
english-speaking children of the overseas post-colonial elites...This is the 
nasty secret behind UBC's chronic shortage of seats for qualified Canadians 
noted each year by the McLean's annual university survey, notwithstanding 
strenuous 'politically correct' protestations by university administrators to 
the contrary).</p> 
<p>And don't get me started on public schools, which have become glorified 
daycare shelters for the emotionally neglected children of the productive 
two-earner Canadian household, rather than centers of learning and constructive 
socialization. Those 15 years should be parsed down and compressed, 
complemented by traditional de-ideologized (teachers unions!) traditional 
civics and group socialization component. The Tony Blair government is already 
onto this last aspect, actually.</p> 
<p>I personally favour a return to the old grammar school model, which a 
back-to-basics traditional liberal curriculum and gender-segregated classes in 
critical topics with observable learning differentials from grade 6 to 
completion (i.e. the formative and over-sensitive puberty years).</p> 
<p>Then after high school, students go to either technical institutes run and 
supervised by professional bodies in tandem with government, or public Arts and 
Humanities institutes run by people with a genuine love for the material rather 
than a pernicious ideologically polarized agenda of dismantlement, vandalism 
and reckless revisionism. I'm still a fan of the small Jesuit and Dominican 
colleges which consistently turned out high-quality thinkers using a 
time-tested curriculum, and they always provided for students from low-income 
households to enter and perform on an equal footing, but that's my personal 
opinion. Secular antiquarians make great profs too. Anything but the veiled 
politicized system of careerist patronage that now predominates in the arts and 
social sciences, which treats the student as an inconvenient afterthought and 
an unfortunate necessity.</p> </li>

<p>Both. Children in licenced pre-school programs benefit from the specialized

<p>Now if we look at this together with stump's better preparation, this would

<p></p> 
<p>So true! To that end do you really want to rely entirely on the school 
system/daycares to educate your child. I think this is the core problem with 
respect to &quot;useless&quot; degrees, illiterate graduates, etc. Too many 
people have chosen to have children and then offload the repsonsibility for 
raising them to someone else, be it the daycare teacher, college prof, etc. 
While I don't negate the role of the school system, and generally I think they 
do a decent job, all things considering, I question why so many parents now 
rely totally on the schools to provide their children with moral, health, 
social guidance etc.</p> 
<p>As to Stumps comment that all children benefit from trained ECE 
daycares/preschools I believe the studies indicate that the benefits go 
primarily to those would not normally be exposed to such &quot;learning&quot; 
experiences in their own homes. I'll try and Google the specific studies. 
Personally, I think most parents are more than qualified to show junior how to 
do a puzzle, sing a song, share the swing with other kids, or fingerpaint, but 
unfortunately, a large percentage can't be bothered - they have enrolled their 
toddlers in the early &quot;uneducated populace&quot; immersion program. I 
think the social interactions of daycare are vastly overstated. Long before 
licensed daycares existed chilren got the concept of sharing ... and I think 
had a much better grasp of it ... given some of self-centered, consumer-mad 
kids I see today. Funny, for the most part (and yes, there are huge 
generalizations at either end of the spectrum)the &quot;daycare&quot; kids I 
have encountered have been the most demanding &amp; socially maladjusted group. 
What exactly are you learning if you have to continuously &quot;share&quot; 
with a group of other kids and never, ever have any one-on-one time with an 
adult who has only your best interests at heart?</p> 
<p>Having said that, I would like to see decent preschools &amp; daycare 
available to those who are &quot;child poverty statistics&quot;. The majority

<p>There's exceptional parents and sub-standard daycare workers, but that

<p>These settings were not a homogenous group of 3/4 years old though, the 
group usually included older &amp; younger siblings &amp; the elder carer (be 
it grandma, aunt, whatever) was almost always related &amp; had a vested 
interest in the child, not that I'm saying that daycare workers don't care ... 
they just don't generally care as much as grandma, dad or mom would ... or 
should. A group of preschoolers is not going to learn appropriate social skills 
from each other; that's where older siblings (in your past group setting), 
parents, or if no other options exist, caring &amp; well-trained ECEs come in. 
I would rather see those &quot;good&quot; daycare &amp; preschool spaces go to 
those who would most benefit ... mainly those who fall under the category of 
poverty statistics.</p>

<blockquote> the research for the most part suggests children who have been in

<p></p> 
<p>All the research that I have found (Hawaii's Healthy Start, Aboriginal Head 
Start, Texas Early Education Model, Smart Start - just Google them)with respect 
to improved school readiness relates directly to kids who are at risk (poverty, 
teen mothers, etc.), so it isn't really surprising that they would benefit from 
quality child care/preschool. Here in BC, whether or not a child receives 
quality child care depends greatly on the child's family situation. Families 
with higher incomes tend to use higher quality care, leaving the poorer parents 
to rely on, well lets just say poorer quality care. Those kids living in 
at-risk families or disadvantaged homes would obviously benefit even more from 
quality child care.</p> 
<p>I don't think it takes an &quot;exceptional&quot; parent or ECE training to 
make play-doh with your child or sing the alphabet song - more that too many 
parents find it easier to abdicate this job to someone else. It also makes it 
easier to put the blame elsewhere (public school, for instance) if things don't 
go according to expectations.</p>

<p>Okay, I would not go to my mom for a medical exam, or let her fly me

than many &quot;trained mechanics&quot; and a lot of parents I know could

<p></p> 
<p>Hmmm... 8 hours in daycare, an hour or so in transit, then dinner &amp; off 
to bed ... most children of daycare age are sleeping at least 9/10 hours a 
night. Doesn't leave a whole lot of spare time for the one-on-one, especially 
if there is more than one child in the home. Which I guess leads me to agree 
with you ... the problem doesn't lie with the childcare arrangements ... it 
lies with society's attitude towards children, which in many ways mirrors that 
of the Fraser Inst. Parents: We want kids but I don't want to have to actually 
exert an effort to raise them myself, someone else can do it. Fraser Institute: 
We want uneducated consumers to buy our drivel, but we want someone else to 
deal with all the negative social ramifications. Both parents &amp; Fraser

<blockquote> I'm unclear on how the two might be related. Learning to take 
turns by no means undercuts one's drive to acheive.</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>It is a different mindset. I did not say learning to take turns, I said, be 
happy waiting one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s turn. One can do a thing without liking 
it, because in the situation, it isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worth a fight.</p> 
<p>Happily waiting one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s turn requires some of the stuffing 
having been beaten out of one. It often goes with a degree of selfrighteous 
self-effacing attitude, condemnatory to those who would be enterprising and 
innovative. Known as &acirc;&euro;&tilde;don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t rattle my 
cage&acirc;&euro;&trade;.</p> 
<p>And, I did not say &acirc;&euro;&tilde;achieve&acirc;&euro;&trade;, which 
is a whole different concept from what I mean. I am not talking about getting 
A+&acirc;&euro;&trade;s or doing good within a set of terms others have 
defined, but about having the wherewithal to strike out on your own and create 
your own terms. This kind of ability is what we need now, we have way too few 
leaders in our society. So many institutions are lumbered with a top heavy 
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;leadership&acirc;&euro;&trade;, consisting of individually 
weak people, who set up a whole little mob, so they can lean on each other and 
never really be the sole underwriter of anything. This is so screamingly 
ineffective, and we need to do better.</p> 
<p>Stump made an important observation, when he said that elders often were 
the child care people. This makes sense, as they qualify as trained 
ECE&acirc;&euro;&trade;s, having done the job and received the feed back once 
already. Plus, they do not have vested interest, as they are not on a carreer 
path. I believe this would work. My own grandparents, the one set I had, were 
at least as important in my becoming who I am, as my parents, and I can see the 
difference in my children who grew up without grandparents.</p> 
<p>I agree with raingirl, that a certificate is neither here nor there. In 
dealing with any kind of professional, you surely find an entire spectrum of 
capability and attitudes. I have walked right out the door of 
doctor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s offices, sick or not, because I 
didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t like the vibes, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about horse 
sense.</p> 
<p>I would refer people seriously interested in early childhood, and who 
isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s our

<p>And, I would remind us all of these unforgettable words from Ed Deak: </p>

through monetary manipulations. Somehow, somewhere, sometime, someone or 
something must pay the full cost.</p> </li>

<p>I would hazard a guess that most of us are incapable of teaching ourselves

<p>My claim is, that there is practically no turn-taking, which an individual

 That is interesting. There have been similarly good 
results, for both boys and girls, in public school programs where male and 
female students have been placed in separate classes. Unfortunately, a major 
difficult arises, for boys at least, because of the shortage of appropriate 
male teachers with the kinds of leadership skills necessary to work in such an 
environment. And of course, effective teacher education is a big problem as 
well - the tendency to focus on girls who have usually been more perceptive to 
classroom learning - is something that needs to be overcome at all levels of 
public education.</p> 
<p>The fact that most 'experimental' efforts seem to happen in private schools 
is an indictment of parents, educators and the legislature.</p> </li>

<p>Yes, unfortunately boys don't really have organized advocates militating on 
education policy in the same manner that girls have over the past generation or 
so.</p> 
<p>The importance of gender-specific adaptation of the curriculum was 
correctly identified by feminists, albeit in a very one-sided way. No thought 
was given to possible collateral effects in a co-ed environment. Boys found 
themselves in an environment tailored to let Jane know how great she was, and 
let Joe know that he can damn well take care of himself.</p> 
<p>One of the greatest unheralded triumphs of feminism in the school system 
was the expansion of sport for girls. Pedagogical feminism was very aware that 
girls were missing out an this essential rite of passage, whereby boys were 
learning how to co-operate in groups, take and give direction, handle getting 
knocked down &amp; picking themselves up again, and how to manage self-esteem 
in an environment in which defeat was part of the game, and mutual criticism a 
necessary and depersonalized exercise in team progress. In my opinion, the 
growth of team sports for girls has done more to give the current crop of girls 
and young women a leg up than any campus cuddle-session at the womynz centre.
</p> 
<p>No we have to find ways to do the same for boys, in those areas where boys 
have become deficient and maladapted.</p> </li>

<p>Interesting perspective nightbloom. In some respects boys' sports, at the

<p>That's an excellent point - that boys' sports have wandered away from their 
constructive purpose and are now used to reward and promote the worst kind of 
socialization. Ultimately, that kind of sportingexcludes the vast majority of 
boys; it effectively locks out those most in need of constructive socialization 
(i.e. unathletic boys, loners, gay/effeminate boys, etc.). These rejects are 
the male analogy of the archetypal schoolyard &quot;fat girl&quot; we're all 
familiar with. They're in a fix, because they can access neither the 
traditional male socialization structures, nor the new ones that have been 
created for girls.</p>
