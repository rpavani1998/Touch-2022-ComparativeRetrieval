<p>A staple of rental car fleets across America, the current-generation Chevy 
Impala is anything but an object of desire. But with the all-new 2014 Chevrolet 
Impala making its world debut at the 2012 New York auto show, the Bow Tie brand 
is promising to erase memories of the long-running nameplate&rsquo;s largely 
forgettable outgoing model with a more refined interior, the latest in 
technology, and a vastly improved driving experience when it goes on sale in 
early 2013.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<br>
The 10th-generation Impala 
is based on a stretched version of GM&rsquo;s Epsilon II platform, which also 
underpins the Cadillac XTS and Buick LaCrosse. The car will be offered 
exclusively in front-wheel drive, and offer three engines to pair with a 
standard six-speed automatic transmission. Those direct-injection engines 
include a 2.4-liter I-4 with eAssist mild hybrid technology, estimated to 
produce 182 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque; a 2.5-liter Ecotec I-4 estimated at 195 
hp and 187 lb-ft; and the familiar 3.6-liter V-6 producing 303 hp and 264 
lb-ft. Those numbers are up slightly from the 3.6-liter engine in the current 
Impala, which produces 300 hp and 262 lb-ft. The General expects the 2.4-liter 
eAssist model to be EPA-rated at 35 mpg on the highway. The platform-mate 
LaCrosse eAssist is rated at 25/36 mpg city/highway &ndash; expect similar 
numbers from the 2014 Impala.

GM says the new 
Impala&rsquo;s stronger structure enhances the quietness of the full-size 
sedan&rsquo;s passenger compartment, and improves the handling and ride. The 
Impala rides on a MacPherson-strut front suspension and four-link rear 
independent suspension, and has its front cradle isolated from the rest of the 
car by way of a hydraulic ride bushing. The new Impala adds 1.2 inches to its 
wheelbase, though overall dimensions don&rsquo;t change much (0.9 inches 
longer, 0.1 inches wider, and 0.2 inches taller.)

<br>
Though the 2014 Impala 
remains roughly the same size, its design has been dramatically revised. The 
long, raked-back profile is meant to pay homage to past Impalas, while still 
providing a contemporary look. A wide grille is front and center, framed by a 
pair of low-profile projector headlamps which sweep around the corners of the 
front end. Those headlamps feature HIDs on the LTZ model, along with LED 
daytime running lights. The hood gets a slight power bulge, intended to convey 
a look of performance. A long greenhouse area accentuates the Impala&rsquo;s 
sleek profile, and finally comes to a point at the rear quarter window, which 
terminates right before the Impala emblem on the rear panel. The Impala now 
comes standard with 18-inch wheels (steel or alloy, depending on trim), with 
19- and 20-inch alloys available.
<p></p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>One of the previous Impala&rsquo;s biggest trouble spots was its low-rent 
interior. GM is addressing that issue in the new model by employing 
high-quality fabrics, Ultrasuede, and perforated leather inside the cabin of 
the 2014 Impala. The door panels and dashboard get soft-touch materials, while 
the seats are meant to look more premium than the old model with higher-quality 
stitching. Ambient lighting is available. A central 4.2-inch color display 
within the wraparound instrument cluster relays the driver information, while 
an 8-inch touch screen with a hidden storage compartment behind it adorns the 
center stack. Through this touch screen, drivers can interface with 
Chevy&rsquo;s available MyLink system, which incorporates Bluetooth hands-free 
phone and streaming audio, plus optional navigation.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<br>
Safety was another focus on 
with the new Impala. The 2014 model offers full-speed-range adaptive cruise 
control that can come to a complete stop and accelerate again depending on 
traffic movement in front of the vehicle. GM says the system&rsquo;s appearance 
in the 2014 Impala will mark its first use in a Chevy model. GM&rsquo;s 
collision mitigation braking system &ndash; another Chevy first &ndash; can 
apply the brakes automatically if a crash is imminent. Other safety features 
include forward collision alert, lane departure warning, side blind zone alert, 
and rear cross traffic alert, which use either radar or cameras to detect 
various hazards and alert the driver.

<br>
The LS, LT, and LTZ trims 
carry over to the 2014 Impala, which will be built at GM&rsquo;s 
Detroit-Hamtramck and Oshawa, Ontario (Canada), plants. Shaking that rental car 
image will take some time, but these changes could go a long way in earning the 
nameplate back some of its lost prestige. But will they be enough to challenge 
other full-sizers like the Toyota Avalon, Hyundai Azera, and Chrysler 300? Stay 
tuned.

 One 
review in another magazine said it's like a larger Cruze. &nbsp;For sure, it's 
nothing like the real Impalas that were large, held six adults, V8s, coupes, 
and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people 
around, it should do OK. vertigo5110 - Today 08:10 AM <br>
 I think anybody 
still hoping/praying for RWD on this car is kidding themselves. &nbsp;In this 
day and age of fuel economy regulation, we are likely to never see a RWD car 
for the masses (save for the Charger/300). &nbsp;That said, I think for what 
this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
I will 
echo everybody else's sentiments concerning the steering wheel. &nbsp;My mom 
has a 2008 Saturn Vue XR AWD (with one of the first iterations of GM's now 
ubiquitous 3.6 V6 making around 270 hp). &nbsp;The steering wheel in that car 
was gorgeous (IMO). &nbsp;A nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple 
three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting. &nbsp;I wish GM would've taken 
a similar design and built upon it for this car but oh well.<br>
<br>

(http://image.automotive.com/f/2008_saturn_vue/2308203520936955304+w500/steering-wheel.jpg)
<br> <br>
Other than, I think this car will perform well in the sales 
department. Nick099 - Today 06:49 AM <br>
 The car's underpinnings are 
lackluster to say the least. The efforts by manufacturers to compensate for the 
idiotic CAFE regulations by the Obozo Administration have been tried 
before....with disastrous results. 4 cylinder engines in large cars are not a 
good idea, not matter how stressed you make them. Front-wheel drive is for 
bargain, commuter cars, nothing more.<br>
<br>
That being said, the styling of 
this car is just beautiful. The designers really hit one out of the park. The 
curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design 
language. Just wonderful.<br>
<br>
So there you have it: a wonderfully styled 
car... with engineering choices not made by the bean-counters of old...but the 
political officers of the new regime. Oh what a brave new world. bowery01 -

 What is up with the Curly Q over the back wheel? GM 
should have re-badged the Pontiac G8 (Australian muscle car) for the Impala 
replacement. LAKESHORE026 - Yesterday 03:34 PM <br>
 Great looking car from the 
outside. I hope it does'nt have the cave type of appearance of the Lacrosse in 
person and that if in the drivers seat one has good visiblility all around. 
&nbsp;GM could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an 
afterthought. Glad that they kept the 3.6Ltr. as an option. upgrayedd - 
Yesterday 12:37 PM<br>
 I give it an exuberant... 'meh.' &nbsp;It's still 
bland. &nbsp;It is an improvement over the last one, but it's nothing special. 
&nbsp;And what's with that dash pad? &nbsp;It looks like they glued doilies 
randomly all over it. &nbsp;I like Chevy's, but I don't like this car. 
&nbsp;I'd take a new Fusion any day over this. ejd1984 - Yesterday 09:58 AM <br>
 It's a GREAT looking car. I really like it with the blue color.<br>
<br>
I 
just read on another website that AWD will not be offered on the Impala. 
Personally I think it's a mistake.<br>
<br>
I doubt a Super Sport model will 
offered either. Since an SS would need the (developing) 3.6L twin-turbo, and 
AWD to handle the power.<br>
<br>
Seems like to me that GM is trying to protect 
the sales of the more expensive models based on this platform - The Buick 
Lacrosse and Cadillac XTS. BriCan - Yesterday 09:50 AM <br>
 Nice new Toyota, 
you guys at G.M.!<br>
I really think the designers of this slept with the 
designers of the new Avalon ( and, maybe the Azera, as well) &nbsp;This looks 
&nbsp;way to much like a Toyota.<br>
Given the heritage that the Impala has, 
where is there any originality in this?<br>
And we have just been told that 
front end was for the trucks....<br>
G.M. used to have brilliant 
styling....lets have some of it back! cars3 - Yesterday 09:29 AM <br>
 This 
2013 Chevrolet Impala is so hot!! Wow, fantastic design along with the great 
reliability and handling of Chevrolet makes one great car! dmadam - Yesterday

 Until they go rear wheel drive its just another failed GM 
imitation of what it used to be. dhan219 - Yesterday 05:40 AM <br>
 I'm really 
diging this car. I think it is the best looking front wheel drive sedan under 
40. &nbsp;I'm 34 and I wouldn't mind driving one. I hope they have an AWD drive 
option. dacronic1 - 04/04/12 10:34 PM <br>
 y didnt this go rear wheel drive? 
it could have been a good competitor for the 300/Charger. unless its rear 
drive, itll never perform like those two. Seva25 - 04/04/12 10:18 PM <br>
 
Beautiful re-design, both inside and out. Finally looking like the 90's Impala.
<br>It would be great if an SS version with a strong V-8 would also be offered 
in the future.<br>
The 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs 
currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary 
status.<br>
One of the things that made Impala a legend was it's strong engine, 
and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be 
considered a dud in the future (like the current generation Impala). 
davejensen77 - 04/04/12 08:19 PM <br>
 Wow!!!! &nbsp;I am really impressed with 
this car, and I'm sure it looks even better in person. &nbsp;I've owned two 
Impalas previously (a 2003 LS, and a 2008 LT), and they were both great 
cars!!!! &nbsp;Although I do suspect that Chevy will raise the price some on 
this car, I hope they don't raise it too much. &nbsp;The value of the Impala 
has always been very strong!!!! himoses - 04/04/12 06:02 PM <br>
 People think 
this looks like an Azera? &nbsp;Ya'll must be blind. &nbsp;I think it looks 
nicer on the outside than the Taurus, but comes short of the Azera on the 
inside and out. &nbsp;However, I would think the price will undercut the Azera. 
gilby777 - 04/04/12 05:55 PM <br>
 Wow, I hate to say that I'm surprised, but I 
am! &nbsp;I like it! &nbsp;It's light years ahead of the current generation in 
design: as in, there is some design. &nbsp;Like it or not, at least they're 
trying. &nbsp;Nice job, Chevy. time2shine - 04/04/12 04:48 PM <br>
 Think it 
has been improved and agree some of the design is busy. I believe styling is 
behind 2013 malibu just like taurus is behind 2013 fusion. Just happy USA back 
in the game go GM and FORD! jgf1031 - 04/04/12 04:35 PM <br>
 Whoever thinks 
this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about. Lay off the sauce Name 
one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end. Mustang fanboys 
probably don't like it bc it resembles the camaro. Understandable. But this 
looks way more manly than a 300, Avalon, Taurus, or Maxima<br>
ryandarr1979 - 
04/04/12 03:58 PM<br>
 Its a huge step up in the styling dept from the 
invisible 9th gen Impala BUT whats with the 3 creases in the rear door?! The 
rear door just looks terrible. WAY too busy in my opinion. The interior looks 
great and the front end is OK but the rear door just looks awful. Surprised no 
one else has said anything. Glad they are sticking with the 3.6 engine. Great 
combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable 
transportation with some power. nemesis4 - 04/04/12 03:57 PM <br>
 When i 
glanced at the picture on the main page I instantly thought it was a new 
Passat. Looks just like it. 92Vectra1.6i - 04/04/12 03:36 PM <br>
 This is the 
best fwd Impala yet, and as far as being reliable, efficient transportation, is 
the best Impala ever. I'm not a fan of the looks like it should have been on a 
2nd gen. HHR rear quarter, but otherwise this is huge improvement styling wise 
over any post '72 Impala. Chevrolet needs to offer a turbo 4 cylinder with 
about 240 horsepower and more importantly, at least 250 lb-ft. with a goal of 
35 mpg highway. rich-b - 04/04/12 03:29 PM <br>
 Would be far better it came 
with a V-8 and rear drive. &nbsp;Impala's shouldn't have 4 cylinders, &nbsp;it 
just is too small for a car that size. &nbsp; In fact Malibu's shouldn't have 
only 4 cylinders only either. &nbsp;The CAFE regs are making cars lame again 
like they did in the late 1970's. &nbsp;Didn't we learn anything? redvette77 - 
04/04/12 03:26 PM<br>
 Everyone seems to be missing the same thing. The people 
who buy this car not only do not care if it is FWD, RWD, or AWD, they likely do 
not know the difference. The exterior is attractive, the interior offers more 
than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers. I 
see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market. 
veritas_aequitas - 04/04/12 03:12 PM <br>
 There's only two things I don't like 
about it- ONE: The steering wheel looks like the ones in some Mercedes, TWO: 
It's not a RWD. MH_5 - 04/04/12 03:12 PM <br>
 Finally an Impala with some 
substance! DanV8 - 04/04/12 02:56 PM <br>
 I changed my mind about this car. At 
first I thought wow nice than I thought, again not the car I was hoping it 
would turn out to be not edgey enough. Again chevy is making the impala to 
compete and not dominate. A rwd car would of sealed the deal. nicombobula - 
04/04/12 02:12 PM<br>
 people this DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AN AZERA!!!! your eyes 
must all be broken for real. cause you may as well say the same about the 
accord too if youre gonna say that. this thing is all its own your brain is 
lying to you side by side pictures of what youre saying it looks like and youll 
feel stupid capitals - 04/04/12 01:46 PM <br>
 overall a nice car 
inside/outside, but the four cylinders, i don't know maybe the turbo with 270hp 
will be okay in this car. but the ride will say more. jimmytheg - 04/04/12 
01:45 PM<br>
 Well, Hertz, Avis and Budget just soiled their skivvies. &nbsp;I 
really wanted to like the Impala, mainly because of the late 80's, early 90's 
ones (exc. 91-93) But again, another brick from GM. &nbsp;FWD and sick, wheezy 
little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab. &nbsp;What's with the 
freaky-deaky hood? nothing like a huge, undulating gap in body panels to scream 
quality. and how about that dashboard? &nbsp;Looks like some kind of california 
ghetto carpeted dash cover you buy from JC Whitney for $39.<br>
<br>
Bring over 
the V-8 Holden, you cowardly jackwads. g35cltypeS - 04/04/12 01:35 PM <br>
 
accord camry maxima a6 m35 etc in a blender. i actually like it better than 
anything ive seen from them. good job, finally! Sleeper91TSi - 04/04/12 01:24 PM
<br>  Too much car for a 4 cylinder. This thing will be just like the Ecoboost 
Exploder. laserwizard - 04/04/12 01:18 PM <br>
 Looks like a cheap korean 
ripoff of a Toyota Camry - the interior is more mishmash of design disasters 
from Government Motors - nothing works together - colors don't coordinate - 
textures are horrible - the exterior has a mishmash of dents, creases, and 
concepts. &nbsp;It just doesn't work - some colors make this thing look 
profoundly cheap. &nbsp; This isn't mindless Impala bashing - it is an honest 
assessment of a product that just doesn't work as it is offered. sami_sa1 - 
04/04/12 12:51 PM<br>
 Is this car is designed by a designer who works for KIA/ 
Hyundai and who is impressed by Audi A7 rear end?<br>
<br>
If this car falls in 
the league of Toyota Avalon &amp; Ford Taurus, then the new 2013 Ford Taurus is 
tighter, cohesive and better looking car. ElGatoFuego - 04/04/12 12:39 PM <br>
 
Dang, it looks fantastic. The only thing I don't like is the steering wheel, 
which has always been a problem for GM. The new Acadia has a steering wheel 
from 1990, as does the traverse, escalade etc. But this looks much more 
expensive than it will be. lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 PM <br>
 Having 
lived through the great Impalas that were large cars, V8s, stylish, coupes, and 
breathtaking in many ways, I wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler Impalas 
(sedans), but this is nicely styled and I would consider this over a more bland 
Camry or Accord. &nbsp;Plus, GM's powertrain warranty matches 
Chrysler's...better than Ford or Toyota. &nbsp;At least this Impala would 
easily fit in the garage unlike the old ones. &nbsp;Good job, Chevy. syj - 
04/04/12 12:23 PM<br>
 reading through the comments you can see who is being 
realistic and honest and who is offering mindless Impala bashing. Insulting 
THIS car because the current 7 year old car is a rental favorite is stupid. I 
dont care how many current impalas are sold to rental agencies, THIS one looks 
good.<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned the Azera- the Hyundai is attractive but still 
derivative of existing Asian luxury cars. Niether car looks bad but this just 
seems more masculine and American looking. And the interior if this is def a 
step up over the Azera which basically has the interior of the Elantra. 
Inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 PM <br>
 It looks like a 4-door Camaro with the 
rear of a Cruze. &nbsp;Like the side profile but that is it. &nbsp;The steering 
wheel is horrendous and the toupee on top of the guage cluster is rediculous. 
&nbsp;A hodgepodge of GM designs. &nbsp;There is nothing original here. &nbsp;
<br> <br>
This will retain it's title as the fleet queen. &nbsp;No doubt. 
ThrottleBlip - 04/04/12 11:28 AM <br>
 Car looks great but the ugly steering 
wheel looks just like the terrible unit found in the current gen Mercedes 
S-Class. &nbsp;The rest of the interior is well done though. sccardriver - 
04/04/12 11:23 AM<br>
 This car is a much larger car than the new Malibu is. I 
think GM has created another huge improvement in its line up. I am impressed 
with the look of this car. Alex daOriginal - 04/04/12 11:02 AM <br>
 i wouldn't 
call it an icon but it's definitely one nice car &nbsp;I hope this trend 
continues. and now i can't wait to see the Silverado/Tahoe/ and C7 Corvette!<br>
skyguy - 04/04/12 11:01 AM <br>
 And please tell me why this is not a direct 
competitor with the Malibu. mynameisj - 04/04/12 10:52 AM <br>
 is it me or 
does the rear 3/4 view looks EXACTLY like that of the Hyundai Sonata pennrck22 
- 04/04/12 09:46 AM<br>
 Wife and I love it! seriously looking into replacing 
her Malibu with an Impala instead of the new Malibu. FWD not a bother since 
itll be the wifes car..<br>
<br>
those complaining about RWD, WAKEUP and READ!! 
chevys new RWD sedan coming to replace the impala in NASCAR!!<br>
<br>
overall, 
minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing 
the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an AWD SS model!! 
NotAlwaysBeenGood - 04/04/12 09:06 AM <br>
 Better looking than the last car by 
a country mile, but I find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the 
interior. &nbsp; Still, leaps and bounds better than the current car. &nbsp; It 
does look more like a Buick-wannabe or hyundai than a chevy, but lately, that's 
been a good thing. &nbsp; Too bad it's &quot;exclusively FWD.&quot; &nbsp; 
Nonetheless, they'll sell a ton of these to police departments, rental car 
companies, and GM fans. poplifedc - 04/04/12 08:51 AM <br>
 I stopped reading 
once I got to &quot;The car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel 
drive...&quot;<br>
<br>
Wake me up from this nightmare when GM decides to make 
it RWD. himoses - 04/04/12 08:40 AM <br>
 A decent efforts that reminds me of a 
cross between a Camaro and Charger that got dialed back a bit. &nbsp;I don't 
love it, but it looks decent. &nbsp;I like the Azera's design better.<br>
<br>

Interior is okay. &nbsp;I hope to see a little refinement. &nbsp;Everything 
will hinge on materials and build quality. &nbsp;The current Impala is built 
okay, but its interior on one of my relative's 2009 is already falling apart. 
&nbsp;I haven't heard of that being a widespread issue, but I would hope for 
better materials and build quality. AeroKnight29 - 04/04/12 08:33 AM <br>
 
Mostly love it. The steering wheel and back end are disappointing though 
considering how good looking the rest is. Lead_Foot89 - 04/04/12 08:30 AM <br>
 
this model is a step in the right direction for the impala. feel as though its 
lost its sporty/athletic look in favor of a more premium look. leaps and bounds 
better than the tired model its replacing though. rwd would be sweet nicombobula
 - 04/04/12 08:22 AM<br>
 at first i was kind of polarized by this car but its 
growing on me! to all of you saying it looks like an azera? wrong nothing like 
it, the passat even more wrong a cc at best closest resembles this. as someone 
else stated these new grills for the impala and traverse seem to be for their 
upper class models however if you look at least on the impala it has two bars 
in the grill symbolizing the single bar found on chevys. but ya back to the 
front end comparisons side by side this with a camaro and youll see a 
resemblance Logan814 - 04/04/12 08:16 AM <br>
 @connermt the Fusion, Accord, 
Camry, Passat, and Altima are not in the Impala's class,they compete with the 
Malibu. &nbsp;I believe the Taurus, Avalon, CC, and Maxima compete with the 
Impala.<br>
<br>
Either way the Impala looks good, the interior in the 9th 
generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better. &nbsp;This much improved 
interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage. ejd1984

 It looks great! It would be even better if it was rwd.
<br> <br>
I wonder how much of this styling will influence the rumored 
Chevrolet SS/Chevelle/Caprice sedan.<br>
<br>
It almost seems to me that 
Chevrolet might be creating a two-tier lineup. This new grill styling, along 
with the Traverse, will be for the Chevrolet &ldquo;Premium&rdquo; models. 
Where as the split grill will be for the more &ldquo;economical&rdquo; vehicles.
variaban - 04/04/12 08:06 AM <br>
 Looks much better than the model it 
replaces. I can't help but notice how much it looks like the current Azera 
though.. almost like they had the Azera on hand when they were designing this 
car. Annassie32 - 04/04/12 08:04 AM <br>
 So we now have a Chevy CC, I 
understand the V6 and the semi-hyrbrid, but WTF is with that normal 2.5? I just 
dont think that moter will have the power to pull this car around, they might 
want to add a blower to that motor to make it relevent.<br>
2.5 good for 
Malibu, bad for Impala. connermt - 04/04/12 08:03 AM <br>
 Not crazy about the 
rear end, but leaps and bounds ahead of the current model in terms of design. I 
would have left the instrument cluster hood the same color as the rest of the 
dash, but other than those two things, this car looks great. Glad they kept a 
V6 option for a while longer. I can't think of any non-GM car in this class 
that looks this good: Fusion? Nope. Taurus? Nope. Accord? Haha - not. Camry? 
Not quite. Altima? Nah, it's interior doesn't look as good. Passat? Looks good, 
but there's no flare like the Impala has. 300/Charger? Those are probably the 
closest, though they're RWD. Avalon? Not even in the same solar system as this 
car. TL? Pft...no. Audi, BMW, Benz all higher class cars so they don't really 
compare...<br>
Nope, can't think of another non-GM car in this class that looks 
this good.<br>
And congrats to GM for leaving out the fake wood on this model. 
Let's hope it STAYS out of ALL models. AstnMrtn007 - 04/04/12 07:42 AM <br>
 
Certainly some VW Passat in that front end design. Looks pretty sharp, and that 
interior seems pretty fantastic. Appears to be a huge leap forward from the 
&quot;current&quot; model. Rangeroller - 04/04/12 07:38 AM <br>
 WOW!!, 
stunning car, I love the sharp crease at the rear. syj - 04/04/12 07:31 AM <br>

 This car will have the 2.5L AND the e-assist system. The regular 2.4L is being 
phased out.<br>
<br>
@autobug: <br>
<br>
The current car is a fleet king 
because its OLD and outdated and affordable. This car is going to be MUCH more 
expensive with all the bells and whistles and its BRAND new. This isnt being 
designed as a rental car first. Im thinking a loaded LTZ will be around $38k. 
Current car tops out around $31k or so. Tina_Dang - 04/04/12 07:23 AM <br>
 
Can't believe I am saying this, but it really looks handsome..... Roadmastah - 
04/04/12 07:22 AM<br>
 Since when did GM figure out that it's okay to make an 
attractive Impala? Or should I say Impasat? cp_09malibuV6 - 04/04/12 07:15 AM 
<br>  I like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new Malibu, the way 
the new Malibu makes the Cruze look cheaper by comparison. beard - 04/04/12 
06:50 AM<br>
 Not bad. autobug2 - 04/04/12 06:42 AM <br>
 Although the photos 
depict a loaded LTZ, it looks as though Chevy may have gotten this one right 
for a change. Sure, its based on the LaCrosse platform, but very much a 
different animal. Unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as 
soon as GM pumps Budget &amp; Hertz rental fleets full of these. Hate to see a 
nice design get watered down like that. It's still America's bread-n-butter 
sedan, and has been for decades. Tibbz - 04/04/12 06:30 AM <br>
 I like the 
Camaro-esque front. &nbsp;Looks SO much better than the previous model. 
&nbsp;Golf clap for Chevy.... bhallais - 04/04/12 06:21 AM <br>
 It's a huge 
improvement over the current Impala, but the 2013 Ford Fusion still looks 
better. IMHO. Way better. _E60_ - 04/04/12 06:15 AM <br>
 It's still a pretty 
vanilla-looking car (not really a deal-killer considering how bland its closest 
competitors all look), but I admit it looks gorgeous when compared to the 
outgoing Impala. Huge improvement, I must say. adamlink - 04/04/12 06:03 AM <br>
 I hate to say, because I've always hated Chevy and in particular the Impala . 
. . but that is a sharp looking car. &nbsp;Great lines, great details, great 
wheels.<br>
<br>
Will the quality be there, that's the question. c6vette - 
04/04/12 06:02 AM<br>
 I think it's pretty nice. &nbsp;The only thing I don't 
like is that steering wheel. &nbsp;Why so big and flat in the center? &nbsp;The 
rest looks pretty good and it's definitely different. redvette77 - 04/04/12 
05:56 AM<br>
 This. Is. Stunning. I really cannot believe it look this good. I 
wasn't expecting anything this nice. Even more comforting than the design is 
the fact that the Malibu and Impala finally do not overlap. Major props to the 
design team both in and out. block - 04/04/12 05:51 AM <br>
 2.4L? &nbsp;I 
thought the 2.5L replaces it in a few months. &nbsp;Malibu uses the 2.4L only 
because the 2.5L was not yet ready, but next year all Malibus will use the 
2.5L, so why not the Impala in 2013? &nbsp;Weird to keep the 2.4L around unless 
it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4L. 
&nbsp;Hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5L will be used later 
in the year or 2014 (2015 model). &nbsp;35MPG is good though for such a large 
car. &nbsp;A little more &quot;oomph&quot; (30+HP and lots of torque) from the 
electric motor would be nice though in such a large car. lsobboh - 04/04/12 
05:50 AM<br>
 I'm a little surprised to see complaints here. I think it is a 
fantastic looking car, and compared to the old Impala, this car is considerably 
better on looks alone. I'm still not a fan of Chevy tan and brown interiors and 
their tacky &quot;ambient lighting&quot; but I'd say that the Avalon and Azera 
has their work cut out for them. IBx1 - 04/04/12 05:46 AM <br>
 Nice azera. 
&nbsp;Old hyundai front, current sides and back. &nbsp;The interior is original 
and looks great, but can we please get rid of akerson now for what he's doing 
to GMDesign? syj - 04/04/12 05:36 AM <br>
 @psycowboy: <br>
<br>
Badge 
engineering? Are you blind? This looks nothing like XTS or Lacrosse inside and 
out. On top of that, none of the three cars have the exact same powertrains 
choices. This doesnt offer AWD and it offers the 2.5L. Lacrosse doesnt offer 
the 2.5 and offers AWD. XTS has V6 only and offers AWD.<br>
<br>
I dont 
understand why people think that RWD is the main reason for the success of the 
Chrysler LX cars. Their space, value and style is what people like- most folks 
could care less about RWD. The V6s are what people buy anyway, not the HEMI 
models.<br>
<br>
@toycrusher: <br>
<br>
The current car is BARELY full sized. 
This car is clearly full sized in terms of space. And the price will likely 
move closer to $30k to start. It wont be compared to midsizers. jackal119 - 
04/04/12 05:13 AM<br>
 I see a really ugly Honda not a Chevy... mixed news with 
this one, needs an SS model and all wheel drive to battle the Ford SHO. I sure 
hope that picture is wrong that&rsquo;s a pretty sad Impala. Toycrusher - 
04/04/12 04:58 AM<br>
 First decent looking Impala in years. But seriously, who 
cross shops Impala's with anything in it's class? Taurus, 300, Charger, Azera, 
Avalon?<br>
It's always been cross shopped with midsizers like the Malibu, 
Fusion, Camry, Etc...<br>
<br>
Maybe this new model will finally let it step up 
to other competitors in it's intended class 92Vectra1.6i - 04/04/12 04:44 AM 
<br>  If 12.9 seconds through a quarter mile (the best time to date for my 
Corvette 327 powered Impala) doesn't qualify as fast, I'd hate to see what 
does. This is my second sub 14 second '68 full size Chevrolet, the other being 
a 385 horsepower 427 Bel Air that was a couple of tenths slower (13.2) than the 
L79, but had it covered on the mph side of the time slip (110-112&gt;105-108). 
What's really impressive about '65 to '70 full size Chevrolets isn't their 
impressive acceleration capability when equipped with upper tier V8's (325 
horsepower and up), but their modern road manners, especially when equipped 
with the optional after '67 front disc brakes and accompanying 15 inch wheels. 
The new Impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the 
best fwd Impala yet. I like a lot of what I see, but that rear quarter just 
doesn't work !! machinereplica - 04/04/12 03:41 AM <br>
 To anyone who says the 
early Impalas of the 60's were anything more than all show and no go are 
ridiculous. The only models that had any kind of acceleration were the SS 
models and even then they weren't really speed demons. This isn't a dig on the 
old Impalas, I just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the 
old Impalas as better than they really were. A friend of mine actually has a 
gorgeous 65 Impala. It is an extremely nice car and sounds great with a huge 
lump of snarling iron under the hood, but it is by no means fast. psycowboy - 
04/04/12 03:21 AM<br>
 ...and the inevitable return to badge engineering. 
Sucks. I really thought that Lutz would've been able to pull it off; the 
trimming down, and building up of a truly competitive American brand. Lord 
knows I love an LS-X over just about anything. I at least had hope...a front 
wheel drive Impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone 
feared; that absolutely nothing has changed. pmirp1 - 04/04/12 02:54 AM <br>
 
Not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and 
the Ford Taurus and Avalons of the world. &nbsp;It doesn't worry the Chrysler 
twins (300 and Charger) one bit. &nbsp;And those four cylinder engines sound 
pathetic for a car of this size. dhan219 - 04/04/12 01:05 AM <br>
 Looks better 
then the its twins Buick Lacrosse and Cadillac XTS. BigDogDiesel - 04/04/12 
12:23 AM<br>
 For it to truly be a rebirth of an icon it would have to be RWD, 
then it would be a truly amazing car, this however is a very good car for the 
price and the segment, it looks great but at the end of the day its all show 
and no go, where as the original Impala did both amazingly. This car is great 
and its a huge step forward for the Impala and its one step closer to 
greatness. I hope Chevy comes out with an AWD version, that would be pretty 
cool. impalastreetracer17 - 04/03/12 11:46 PM <br>
 It looks like it should be 
rwd. But overall i do like the design. Its fresh looking and graceful. I just 
am disappointed in the rear again. I loved the rear lights on the 00-05 impala. 
They could have easily done something like a 65 impala rear tail lights. I want 
Heritage. I mean hello they did a great job making the camaro! ThrottleBlip - 
04/03/12 11:24 PM<br>
 Kinda like the design. &nbsp;Looks like it should be 
RWD. &nbsp;I do however wonder what the advantage of eAssist is when the normal 
4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real 
world. &nbsp;To be honest, Full sized sedans should not have such weak 
power-trains to began with in 2012. veritas_aequitas - 04/02/12 01:52 PM <br>
 
Why must Chevy take design cues from other Chevy models in their lineup and 
incorporate them in a &quot;redesigned&quot; model? WHERES THE ORIGINALITY!? I 
know the new impala will have some major technological advancements inside and 
out - &nbsp;I just hope it doesn't look TOO much like the Camaro or the new 
Bu... T2MGB18 - 04/02/12 11:47 AM <br>
 I hope the rear is not some iteration 
of the Camaro rear. &nbsp;I just saw a new Malibu at the local Chevy dealer. 
&nbsp;I was looking at it while I was sitting in traffic. &nbsp;I liked it in 
pictures but in person it looked terrible. &nbsp;Like the old gen better. 
&nbsp;Anyways, I hope they do not do that to the Impala... seano0 - 04/01/12 
07:50 PM<br>
 It would be huge for GM to offer this in AWD. &nbsp;Look at 
compeitors like the Taurus and the Passat. &nbsp;Or even the V6 Charger (a 
stretch, but at least the Impala could be mentioned in the same breath, unlike 
if it's FWD only). &nbsp;And I can only assume they will offer an upcoming 
twin-turbo V6 when ready, the lesser one I assume would be enough. cars3 - 
04/01/12 09:39 AM<br>
 I can't wait for the 2014 Chevrolet Impala, this should 
be a fantastic car. capitals - 03/29/12 02:08 PM <br>
 a 5.3 i don't think so 
maybe one of there new small blocks there working on, or a turbo/supercharged 
v-6. renoboy74 - 03/29/12 04:18 AM <br>
 hope there is an impala supersport in 
the works to square off against the taurus SHO, bring back the 5.3 SS version 
with AWD and then i'll get interested See all 88 comments <br>
