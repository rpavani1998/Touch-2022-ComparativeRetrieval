<p> FORD BUYS TOYOTA TECHNOLOGY.</p> 
<p> No, Ford, the world&rsquo;s number three automaker, isn&rsquo;t giving up 
on hybrids. It&rsquo;s only giving up on its own hybrid technology - at least 
in part.</p> 
<p>Ford has signed a deal to use a portion of Toyota&rsquo;s hybrid technology 
under a licensing agreement. Of the more than 370 patents Toyota holds for its 
hybrid technology, Ford will have access to the blueprints for 20. Ford will be 
able to copy the electronics and software for engine systems as well as 
emissions control.</p> 
<p>According to news reports, Toyota makes a small profit on the hybrid 
vehicles it sells. Honda breaks even on its hybrids and Ford expects to take a 
loss on its Escape Hybrid due in showrooms by the Fall of 2004. The vehicle is 
a year behind scheduled introduction.</p>
