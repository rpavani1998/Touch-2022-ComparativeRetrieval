<h1>Junkyard Find: 1975 Toyota Corolla</h1>  By Murilee Martin on April 18, 
2012<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s strange how the passage of a few decades makes the mid-70s 
Corolla seem like a much better car than it actually was. Granted, it<em>was
</em> quite a car for the time, with a combination of price, reliability, and 
fuel economy that Detroit and Europe couldn&rsquo;t touch&hellip; but if we 
take ourselves out of themindset of the Malaise Era and fast-forward our 
vehicular expectations maybe ten years, this generation of Corolla turns out to 
be a cramped, underpowered, noisy econobox that lasted maybe 150,000 miles (if 
you lived in the rust-free Southwest).<br>
Of course, it&rsquo;s all about 
perspective. If you were a Ford dealer trying to move Pintos in 1975, you 
probably woke up screaming with Corolla nightmares, every night.<br>
You 
don&rsquo;t see many Corollas of this era with automatic transmissions, for 
obvious reasons.<br>
This car&rsquo;s last owner was serious enough about his 
or her car to join theToyota Owners and Restorers Club, but that wasn&rsquo;t 
enough to keep the ol&rsquo; Corolla out of the jaws of The Crusher.</p>

<p> I love the attitude in some blogs (like J******k) that just because some 
old econobox is RWD, then it must automatically be a joy to drive. I know these 
Corollas and Murilee is right &ndash; they&rsquo;re just not much fun. The 
handling and roadholding are uninspired, the engines get noisy and thrashy when 
revved, and the whole car gives off a sensation that it doesn&rsquo;t like to 
be pushed hard. Far less entertaining than the contemporary (and FWD) Honda 
Civic. Corollas of this era were cheap-to-run transportation appliances &ndash; 
nothing more.</p> <br>

<p> Totally correct on the Honda Civics, I had an &rsquo;83 1500DX hatchback 
Civic with the 5spd manual (with working air no less!) and it was one hella fun 
car to drive and I drove it like I stole it a lot.</p> 
<p>It just begged to be driven and did quite well on I-5 heading to Medford 
Oregon from Tacoma Washington and back with no problems at all.</p> <br>

<p> This was my first car. I remember the sound of the 1200cc engine screaming 
at anything near highway speeds. I thought there was something wrong with it, 
and a family friend had to explain that Japanese engines naturally revved high. 
It didn&rsquo;t start easily, and I remember my sister screaming in the 
driveway as she was late for work because of it. She drove it for a few months, 
neglected to put oil on it, and by the time I got it back it exhaled large 
amounts of blue smoke. I remember the ease of driving it, the direct feel of 
the shifter and the heavy vibration as my hand was on it, and the time it took 
to accelerate. I</p> <br>

<p> My first car too &ndash; hand-me-down from my grandmother who bought it 
new. Ugliest shade of yellow ever and the only option: an AM Radio. It was a 
great car to learn to drive in: manual, no power, and the back seat was too 
small to have any other kind of fun either (though I did try&hellip;)</p> 
<p>I drove it for years (one year with studded tires year-round because I was 
too cheap to buy new summer tires &ndash; don&rsquo;t judge me!). It was likely 
a crappy car but it was very reliable considering the abuse it suffered, and 
certainly no Miata like in the recent &ldquo;wah, should I sell my miata? It 
was my first car&rdquo; story, but I loved it!</p> <br>

<p> Did you get my point about bloggers elsewhere holding cars like these up 
as secret sports machines? I was debunking that notion with my statement. 
What&rsquo;s changed is that a modern Corolla is about a zillion times more 
refined, has sufficient go to be actually usable, won&rsquo;t rust nearly as 
much, and will probably last 300,000 miles with maintenance. As for a 1975 
domestic car, I&rsquo;d wager that a Dart or Valiant with the Slant Six would 
last at least as long as the Corolla.</p> <br>

<p> The Valiant and Dart were both bigger and more expensive than a Corolla. 
They didn&rsquo;t compete directly with the Corolla.</p> 
<p>At any rate, they were hardly more fun to drive than a Corolla, and the 
term &ldquo;Chrysler quality control&rdquo; was an oxymoron even for the 
Valiant and Dart in 1975.</p> 
<p>Chrysler quality and reliability had been sliding downhill since about 
1970. The 1975 Valiant and Dart look good today because we now know that what 
came next was even worse.</p> <br>

<p> Chrysler quality control could be very slapdash in the 1970s. I know that 
firsthand &ndash; I owned a 1975 Duster 360 for six years. However, the Dart 
and Valiant were extremely sturdy and long-lived mechanically with the only 
real weakness being rust (something the Toyota wasn&rsquo;t immune to either). 
Though my Duster was in many ways crude, it was basically unbreakable even 
under abuse. My experience mirrors most Dart/Valiant owners, too. As for fun, 
the handling of the torsion-bar-equipped Mopar A-cars was a cut above other 
domestic compacts.</p> <br>

<p> My grandmother had a 1973 Dodge Dart sedan&hellip;it was very reliable and 
reasonably well-made. Chrysler Corporation quality was so variable in the 
1970s, however, which seemed to get worse as the decade progressed.</p> <br>

<p> You can not argue that a slant six is not a durable engine. You just cant.

<p> What gave American cars of that era such a bad reputation was the hit or 
miss (and way too many misses) nature of their quality. Last month I saw two 
beautiful, unrestored Dodges. A 74 Dart Swinger and a Feather Duster, 76 I 
think. Compare them to the Adventurer my dad bought in 74. Bubbles under the 
paint insured rust with a year and massive holes within three. Japanese cars 
weren&rsquo;t great, but at least they were still in good shape when you paid 
them off.</p> <br>

<p> &ldquo;If you were a Ford dealer trying to move Pintos in 1975, you 
probably woke up screaming with Corolla nightmares, every night.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Not hardly. Sales of the Pinto in &rsquo;75 were brisk, with 223,763 units 
sold. That was far down from the &rsquo;73 peak of 544,209 units but by then 
demand for all small cars had pretty much collapsed. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the 
Pinto beat out the Corolla in every year they were sold side by side. The Pinto 
was a better car that was vastly more rust-resistant than anything coming out 
of Japan at the time. The Cologne engine was just as efficient and reliable as 
whatever vacuum-carb nightmares Toyota was equipping their cars with in the 
70&prime;s.</p> <br>

<p> 1975 Pintos were sold to those who bought American no matter what or who 
didn&rsquo;t know anything about cars. Back then we did everything we could to 
talk people we knew out of buying a Pinto. Numbers don&rsquo;t mean all that 
much except for the bottom line &ndash; after all, GM sold 800,000+ Chevy 
Citations for 1980.</p> <br>

<p> 1975 Pintos were sold to those looking for reliable, basic, no-frills 
transportation that didn&rsquo;t see the point in paying a premium for a 
foreign car of basically equal quality. There was nothing that made the 
contemporary Corolla a better value than the Pinto; they were both well-made by 
the standards of the time, both got roughly equal mileage from what I recall, 
and in the case of the Pinto used proven mechanicals that had already been 
manufactured for years. People at the time bought Corollas because they were 
novel, not because they were good cars. At least in the case of Ford, the 
&ldquo;quality gap&rdquo; in small cars didn&rsquo;t really start to appear 
until the 1980&prime;s, and even then it was thin at best.</p> <br>

<p> Once Ford got the bugs worked out of the first-generation North American 
Escort, and debuted the improved 1985 1/2 model, it was more competitive with 
the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic than it had been in the mid- and late-1970s 
with the Pinto.</p> 
<p>Several family members had post-1985 Escorts. They weren&rsquo;t very 
exciting (none of them had the GT model), but they were reliable and a very 
good value for the money. And it&rsquo;s telling that the Escort nameplate 
lasted almost 20 years in the United States &ndash; or twice as long as the 
Pinto nameplate did.</p> <br>

<p> The base MSRP for the 1975 Corolla was $50 less than the cheapest Pinto so 
there was no built-in &ldquo;premium&rdquo;. The difference is that Ford had to 
heavily discount the Pinto to sell it, while Toyota was able to sell the 
Corolla at or near list. That shows which car was seen as being more desirable, 
doesn&rsquo;t it? As for novelty, the Corolla had been sold in the US since 
1969 and began achieving real volume starting in 1970. You&rsquo;re going to 
have to do better than this if you want to convince people.</p> <br>

<p> Agreed on the sales point.</p> 
<p>I owned three Pintos (71, 76, and 80 Bobcat) &ndash; and I remain a 
&lsquo;fan&rsquo; &ndash; but I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were &lsquo;vastly more 
rust-resistant&rsquo; than a Corolla. They were both terrible on that score.</p>
<p>This Corolla is what Toyota built its reputation on. Cars like this offered 
better reliability, fuel economy, and more value than the likes of Pintos, 
Vegas, and Chevettes. The &lsquo;buy American&rsquo; pushback had begun in 
earnest by 1975, but that&rsquo;s all that kept the domestics as sales leaders. 
Consumers eventually figured out TTAC and warmed toward the imports.</p> <br>

<p> The Corolla was a better car than the Vega, but that isn&rsquo;t saying 
much. What Toyota built its reputation on was novelty, and the self-destructive 
fascination with foreign cars that characterized much of the early 70&prime;s. 
People who were of a practical mind and who understood the economic value in 
buying domestically produced &ldquo;unfashionable&rdquo; brands bought Pintos 
and were quite satisfied with their cars. Corollas were bought by people who 
were &ldquo;bored&rdquo; with domestic cars and loved the thrill of rebellion 
they got from being the first one with a Japanese car on the block. The 
Japanese were able to use a savvy combination of dumping, low cost-labor, union 
busting, and the occasional decent car to expand on this trend.</p> <br>

<p> Sorry, but the Corolla was a better car than the Pinto. If you doubt that, 
read contemporary road tests of both cars. Or maybe they, too, are part of that 
vast, Japanese-car conspiracy.</p> 
<p>And if Corollas were so bad, and Pintos were so great, why can I buy a 2012 
Corolla, while I can&rsquo;t buy a 2012 Pinto?</p> 
<p>And the only &ldquo;rebellion&rdquo; driving the sales of Toyotas, Hondas 
and Datsuns in the 1970s was a rebellion against too many shoddy small cars 
produced by the domestics.</p> <br>

<p> Sales figures don&rsquo;t tell the entire story. Ford had far more dealers 
than Toyota in 1975, and there was still a lingering suspicion of foreign cars 
in many parts of the country. Ford and Chevrolet were still the default choices 
of most buyers, particularly among those looking for an economy car.</p> 
<p>The Pinto was more rust resistant than the Japanese cars, but when it came 
to refinement and consistent quality control, the Japanese easily won. Too many 
Pintos were slammed together and shoved out the door, regardless of build 
quality, while Toyota and Honda were perfecting their production processes to 
improve quality. If you got a good Pinto, great, but if you didn&rsquo;t&hellip;
</p> 
<p>The scary part is that the Vega and Gremlin were even worse than the Pinto. 
The Pinto was the best domestic small car of the 1970s, but by 1975, that 
wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p> 
<p>The REALLY scary part is that the domestics were on the way down by the 
mid-1970s, while the Japanese were clearly on the way up. If you were around at 
that time, there was no doubt as to which side had the momentum, and which side 
was coasting on laurels won long ago.</p> <br>

<p> If by &ldquo;lingering suspicion&rdquo; you mean &ldquo;common 
sense,&rdquo; then sure. Once the Japanese car-tel had been given free license 
to pimp their heavily subsidized wares in every city in America by the late 
70&prime;s, Toyota caught up to Ford and GM. But that was only after the 
Japanese government had basically re-focused the entire economy of the country 
towards beating American industry. Victor&rsquo;s history has painted a rosy 
myth of superior Japanese quality winning the day, but the truth is much uglier 
and less politically convenient for the anti-domestic crowd.</p> <br>

<p> Sorry, but it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; to buy an inferior 
product because it happens to be made here. Most people reject that 
&ldquo;logic.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You can attempt to rewrite history all that you want, but the simple fact 
is that the Japanese were rapidly improving their products in the 1970s, while 
the domestics were steadily getting WORSE.</p> 
<p>And to suggest that only the Japanese automakers received subsidies from 
their home government is naive, at best.</p> 
<p>And so what if the Japanese had &ldquo;refocused their entire 
economy&rdquo; on beating the United States in key industries? Please show me 
where that is illegal. If that means that executives can&rsquo;t take home big 
bonuses or union members have to start worrying about things like productivity 
and quality control&hellip;well, boo-hoo-hoo.</p> 
<p>It also ignores that the domestic automakers enjoyed several key advantages 
in the 1970s, including strong brand identities, a large body of owners and a 
strong dealer network.</p> 
<p>The simple fact is that they squandered those advantages with a combination 
of arrogance and complacency. That&rsquo;s not Toyota&rsquo;s fault.</p> 
<p>And, I hate to break it to you, but Japanese quality WAS superior to 
domestic quality by the late 1970s. They &ldquo;won the day&rdquo; in the 
small-car segment by building better vehicles, and all of the attempts to 
rewrite history by buy-American fanboys and UAW apologists won&rsquo;t change 
that fact.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve driven both Japanese and American small cars from the 1970s. My 
first car was a used 1977 Honda Civic, while my father owned a 1973 Gremlin, an 
aunt owned a 1977 Pinto and friends owned various Vegas. There was no doubt as 
to which was better.</p> 
<p>Hint &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t the Vega, Pinto or Gremlin. </p> <br>

<p> Before the outsourcing madness of the 70&prime;s and 80&prime;s, you would 
have been laughed out of the room with your &ldquo;logic.&rdquo; Now that the 
mania of buying disposable foreign junk with no regards to consequences is 
embedded in the national psyche, it has become a great meme for the 
economically unaware. Add to that conveniently unverifiable myths about 
superlatives such as &ldquo;quality&rdquo; and &ldquo;value&rdquo; and you have 
an argument that is guaranteed to be won only by the most dedicated of 
sophists. What the Japanese have created is a self-perpetuating mythology that 
is impossible to combat on logical grounds because it is anchored in nothing. 
But at least I got to admit that you have no problem with a double standard in 
terms of &ldquo;free&rdquo; markets, as long as America comes out the loser.</p>
<p>If the American government decided to create non-tariff barriers to entry 
in the auto market, to subsidize the materials necessary to build cars, to 
provide special tax rebates to auto companies to give them a competitive edge, 
to actively undermine free-trade agreements for their benefit, and to absorb 
much of their research and development costs as well as provide major social 
welfare benefits to their workers, I bet the shrieking from foreign-car 
apologists would be nonstop. Oh wait, it&rsquo;s already nonstop now, with the 
American government having done practically none of these things. But in Japan, 
this happens because everyone knows what side their bread is buttered on. You 
won&rsquo;t find self-defeating pseudo-libertarian jargon about &ldquo;open 
markets&rdquo; and &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; in that country. They smirk and 
know that is nothing but a cover for the interests who profit in the 
destruction of the middle class. Your defense of your &rsquo;77 Civic is 
utterly predictable.</p> <br>

<p> PintoFan,</p> 
<p>I was there too in the 1970s and the Japanese were embarrassing Detroit 
when it came to build quality. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go look up period 
auto magazine tests and even Consumer Reports. I will grant that Pintos were 
fairly sturdy cars, but when it came to fit and finish, any Toyota, Datsun, or 
Honda would see them off. It was even more of a contrast when it came to the 
driving experience. The Pinto felt rough, slow, and crude even next to a 
Corolla, much less a Civic.</p> 
<p>Your devotion to and defense of such a substandard car like the Pinto is 
both touching and sad, as well as being to no avail.</p> <br>

<p> PintoFan: Before the outsourcing madness of the 70&prime;s and 80&prime;s, 
you would have been laughed out of the room with your &ldquo;logic.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A little education here &ndash; manuacturing output in the United States 
has CLIMBED by 30 percent since 2002. What has declined is manufacturing 
employment (by 30 percent over the same period).</p> 
<p>And that is being driven by improved production processes and automation, 
not outsourcing.</p> 
<p>Ford, for example can build more vehicles with fewer people than it could 
in the 1990s (or 1970s), and with higher quality, to boot.</p>

cheap foreign labor.</p>

great meme for the economically unaware.</p> 
<p>If you really believe that Honda and Toyota were peddling 
&ldquo;junk&rdquo; in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and still do today, you need 
to get out more.</p> 
<p>They got where they are by building superior products. </p> 
<p>The fact that the domestics have overhauled their entire operations, from 
the design studio to the factory floor, to improve their products, confirms 
this. They have undergone a revolution, and their vehicles reflect Japanese 
attention to detail and quality control, along with European levels of handling 
and braking. Some (Ford) have responded more effectively than others (GM and 
Chrysler).</p> 
<p>If things were so great before, and they were producing such awesome 
vehicles, why did they have to change their operations and vehicles so 
drastically?</p> 
<p>PintoFan: Add to that conveniently unverifiable myths about superlatives 
such as &ldquo;quality&rdquo; and &ldquo;value&rdquo; and you have an argument 
that is guaranteed to be won only by the most dedicated of sophists. What the 
Japanese have created is a self-perpetuating mythology that is impossible to 
combat on logical grounds because it is anchored in nothing.</p> 
<p>No, what the Japanese have instituted &ndash; or, more accurately, what 
Toyota instituted, and Honda more or less copied &ndash; was a Lean Production 
System that improved product quality and lowered cost, benefiting customers, 
workers and shareholders.</p> 
<p>That is no &ldquo;myth.&rdquo; It is a fact, supported by independent 
surveys over the years.</p> 
<p>If you doubt that, I&rsquo;d suggest reading back issues of Consumer 
Reports. For that matter, I can put you in touch with several independent 
mechanics, or the former service adviser who now works for a Pennsylvania law 
firm that specializes in automotive lemon laws. They all say the same thing 
&ndash; Toyota and Honda make the most reliable, trouble-free cars.</p> 
<p>PintoFan: But at least I got to admit that you have no problem with a 
double standard in terms of &ldquo;free&rdquo; markets, as long as America 
comes out the loser.</p> 
<p>What I &ldquo;admitted&rdquo; was that every country subsidizes the home 
team in various ways. Unfortunately, government subsidies, over the long run, 
won&rsquo;t outweigh lousy vehicles greenlighted by boneheaded management and 
produced by a spoiled union. As GM and Chrysler, and, to a lesser extent, Ford, 
have proven over the past 40 years.</p> 
<p>PintoFan: If the American government decided to create non-tariff barriers 
to entry in the auto market, to subsidize the materials necessary to build 
cars, to provide special tax rebates to auto companies to give them a 
competitive edge, to actively undermine free-trade agreements for their 
benefit, and to absorb much of their research and development costs as well as 
provide major social welfare benefits to their workers, I bet the shrieking 
from foreign-car apologists would be nonstop. Oh wait, it&rsquo;s already 
nonstop now, with the American government having done practically none of these 
things.</p> 
<p>Yes, that is because those &ldquo;foreign car apologists&rdquo; (in the 
real world, we call them &ldquo;paying customers who have voted with their 
hard-earned dollars&rdquo;) have an understanding of economics that seems to 
have eluded you.</p> 
<p>Let me help you. </p> 
<p>Tariffs and other informal barriers help special interests (in the auto 
industry, that would be fat-cat executives, shareholders and unions) while 
hurting CUSTOMERS.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not the responsibility of customers to buy an inferior vehicle 
in order to ensure that executives receive huge bonuses or UAW members never 
lose their jobs.</p> 
<p>The idea that the UAW is the backbone of the middle class, or that everyone 
suffers because UAW members have a higher co-payment for their prescriptions 
drugs, is a myth believed only by the gullible or the hopelessly stupid. Most 
of us have never made UAW wages, and higher new-car prices (the inevitable 
result of tariffs and informal barriers) do not create wealth, but only 
transfer a larger percentage of it from car buyers to shareholders and blue- 
and white-collar employees.</p> 
<p>PintoFan: But in Japan, this happens because everyone knows what side their 
bread is buttered on. You won&rsquo;t find self-defeating pseudo-libertarian 
jargon about &ldquo;open markets&rdquo; and &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; in that 
country. They smirk and know that is nothing but a cover for the interests who 
profit in the destruction of the middle class.</p> 
<p>You might read up on your recent history of Japan. Then you would know that 
the country has been in a serious recession since the early 1990s. The Japanese 
can smirk all they want, but they can only wish that their country&rsquo;s 
economy had performed as well as that of the economy of the United States since 
1990. If they had more &ldquo;pseudo-libertarian&rdquo; thinkers, their economy 
might fully recover.</p> 
<p>PintoFan: Your defense of your &rsquo;77 Civic is utterly predictable.</p> 
<p>Yes, because it was a better car. I speak from personal experience. </p> 
<p>When you have driven one, along with the contemporary competition, let me 
know.</p> 
<p>Agruing that a Pinto was better than a contemporary Corolla (let alone a 
contemporary Civic) is a hopeless cause. You might as well argue that a Big Mac 
Extra Value Meal is better than the meal at a five-star restaurant.</p> <br>

<p> PintoFan:</p> 
<p>I worked for multi-franchise auto dealerships from 1971-1996, including 
some years as a service advisor and in parts. I hate to break it to you, but 
from the &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; level of seeing who was naughty and 
who was nice, THROUGHOUT that period, on average the Japanese brands were head 
and shoulders above the domestics. Not only that, but the Europeans were far 
above the domestics on fit and finish, safety and driving dynamics (on 
reliability, well, not so much).</p> 
<p>From what I see in Consumer Reports, this is still the case, albeit the gap 
may have closed somewhat.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the Asian brands consider quality to be a matter for 
the engineering and manufacturing divisions, while the domestics consider it 
something for the marketing department. And then there&rsquo;s the UAW, which 
adds costs while not adding value (quite the opposite).</p> 
<p>And when it comes to government subsidies, the U.S. government&rsquo;s tens 
of billions of dollars bailout of the UAW (via the bailout of GM and Chrysler) 
&mdash; tens of billions of which will never be repaid (see, e.g., GM&rsquo;s 
tax loss carryforward), simply dwarfs any alleged subsidy or trade favoritism 
that the Japanese could have concocted.</p> 
<p>Tens of billions of taxpayer funds, and all we&rsquo;ve got to show for it 
is continued inferior quality (at least by comparison to the Japanese), a 
still-coddled UAW and flaming Volts.</p> <br>

<p> When we discuss 1975, let&rsquo;s focus on how well we all seemed to have 
compromised that year, producing some of history&rsquo;s most forgotten 
moments. No &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t the drugs being ingested. 1975 conspired to 
be forgotten.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss politics, because, well, just because it brings in the 
blog traffic. Gerald Ford was president. There. Remember Jerry? He was the big 
bald guy that seemed like the kind of white man anyone could have had a beer 
with and not be embarrassed if we let out a fart around. Decent guy. He is 
sandwiched between Richard Malicious Nixon, the guy villified since 1948 by the 
people who believed they were better than us, and Jimmy Holier-Than-Thou 
Carter, the guy Timothy Leary claimed was the second coming of Jesus Christ. 
Dr. Acid was serious.</p> 
<p>Then let&rsquo;s go to music. Led Zepplin fans destroyed Boston because Led 
Zepplin wasn&rsquo;t banned there anymore. Reports at the time mentioned that 
the mobs screamed louder than Jimmy Page singing, &ldquo;A Whole Lotta 
Love&rdquo;. The band is idolized now, but in 1975 it was John Denver everyone 
idolized. Denver was America&rsquo;s biggest solo artist in 1975. John Denver 
was so big, a midget version of him appeared as Cousin Oliver on &ldquo;The 
Brady Bunch&rdquo;, and when the Zepplin crowd wasn&rsquo;t vomiting on Boston, 
you could hear them copy Denver&rsquo;s catchphrase, &ldquo;Far Out!&rdquo; 
Take me home, country roads, to the year I forgot, 1975.</p> 
<p>After pushing large body on frame vehicles that got seven miles per gallon 
into gas stations in 1974, Americans woke up with a Mustang II or an AMC Pacer 
in their driveway. No one knows how that happened except Lee Iacocca, a giant 
rubber shark named Jaws, and a Swedish group singing, &ldquo;Dancing 
Queen&rdquo;. In order to give the Market vehicles that delivered better fuel 
economy, Detroit began shipping all their vehicles with empty engine 
compartments, which was an improvement compared to the four cylinders suddenly 
offered in 4000 pound vehicles that year. 0-60 times were so slow, major auto 
publications began using sun dials.</p> 
<p>Cars were required by Washington to have cow catchers on front and back, 
replacing the bumpers. Cars designed before this year looked like kids with 400 
pound stainless steel braces on their teeth. So, that Mustang II looked pretty 
good in 1975 &ndash; didn&rsquo;t it? The Muscle Car Era was murdered along 
with Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, so the GTO and the Road Runner were gaudy 
stripe options on pathetic compact cars. Alice Cooper, your ride got neutered.
</p> 
<p>Now this car. Excuse me, but by the standards of 1975, this car was a 
Toyota. It wasn&rsquo;t a Mustang II. It wasn&rsquo;t a Pinto Flambe. It 
wasn&rsquo;t a Vega/Monza/Assembly Required GM vehicle. It was the Olivia 
Newton John of the Car Shows in 1975. &ldquo;Have you ever been mellow?&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Besides the ability of ordering a Bicentennial version of a Dodge Dart, the 
ability of hearing &ldquo;Bohemian Rapsody&rdquo; on an AM radio, and seeing 
Diana Ross in the movie, &ldquo;Mahogany&rdquo;, Ameican men also had the 
ability to corset themselves in the tightest pants ever forced upon them by 
fashion. Many discovered that testicles can return into the body cavity when 
wearing 100% nylon thong undies. Cocaine was often abused at that time, but 
I&rsquo;m sure that was merely a coincidence.</p> 
<p>As with an episode of Kojak promising that Manhattan crime could be beaten, 
the Toyota Corolla promised the world that Detroit crimes against autodom could 
be beaten in the year &ndash; uh &ndash; what was that year again?</p> 
<p>I keep forgetting it&hellip; Ah, the joys of compromising. Let&rsquo;s 
remember that when we hear folks complaining about how no one gets along 
anymore. That, and also the fact that when you take a gallon of milk and 
compromise it with urine, you don&rsquo;t get a milkshake.</p> <br>

<p> It sounds like you didn&rsquo;t have much fun in 1975. While that year was 
not exactly landmark, I don&rsquo;t remember it as being quite so gruesome. 
There was also plenty of good music around if you were willing to get past Top 
40 and dig a bit.</p> 
<p>You have to be a little careful with false nostalgia. 1966 is held up as a 
banner year in rock music and deservedly so. However, the #1 song for the year 
was &ldquo;Ballad of the Green Berets&rdquo;. John Denver wasn&rsquo;t even on 
my radar in 1975 much less commanding my attention.</p> <br>

<p> Hmmm, seems too harsh to me. I have pretty good memories of these cars.</p>
<p>A 1973 Corolla SR-5, in particular. High school graduation present to a 
girlfriend from her grandma. The build quality was a revelation, for the time. 
Panel gaps consistent, and small. Sealed doorframes. Slick-shifting 5-speed, a 
little 1.6 hemi (2T-C) that loved to rev, smooth idle, comfortable enough seats 
in front, teen-aged friends could fit in the back if need be. Very reliable, 
and so easy to service. Lotsa trips to/from campus, decent mpg. Designed / 
built by people who seemed to care how it turned out; that wasn&rsquo;t a given 
in this era, IMHO. Yes, very simple engineering, just enough. Which was okay, 
for its role.</p> 
<p>One thing: ewww, I do remember all that vacuum hosing for emissions 
controls in cars of this era. That junkyard shot shows a fenderwell-mounted box 
with a few dozen hoses terminating . Murilee had a post awhile back with a 
Civic&rsquo;s vacuum schematic: frightening!</p> <br>

<p> I know this question does not reflect conventional logic, as everyone 
knows the Pinto exploded when you touched it, but . . .</p> 
<p>Was the Corolla really that much better than the Pinto, aside from the 
handling? My understanding is that the Pinto was quite reliable relative to the 
standards of the day. It had more power than the Corolla, and didn&rsquo;t rust 
as badly. Or is this just another example of domestic vs. import perception. I 
know the anecdotes . . . and again, for the record, my 1977 Corolla was rusty, 
underpowered crap.</p> <br>

<p> No. And the Pinto was not any more dangerous than other contemporary small 
cars. The Gremlin was actually more prone to rear impacts with fire, and the 
small Datsuns had the highest fatality rate of any subcompact car that was not 
the Beetle (which is in its own special category as far as danger was 
concerned). Both the Corolla and the Pinto were mechanically reliable for the 
time, and the Pinto had much better corrosion protection than any Japanese car 
then available.</p> <br>

<p> I believe you are referring to the September 1981 Rutgers Law Review 
article on the Pinto controversy, so some points need to be clarified.</p> 
<p>One, the OVERALL death rate from all types of accidents for the Pinto was 
average for contemporary small cars.</p> 
<p>Two, the death rate for fire-related accidents in the Pinto was slightly 
higher than normal for other small cars of that time.</p> 
<p>Three, the above figure needs to take into account that the Pinto wagon 
never had a problem with its fuel tank or fuel filler tube. The wagon was 
extremely popular and accounted for a very high percentage of Pinto sales.</p> 
<p>Competitive small wagons weren&rsquo;t nearly as popular, nor did they 
constitute such a high percentage of their respective model&rsquo;s total 
sales. This large number of wagons could skew the final fire-related fatalities 
figure in the Pinto&rsquo;s favor.</p> 
<p>The author noted that the Mother Jones article wildly exaggerated the 
number of fire-related Pinto deaths, and completely misconstrued the infamous 
&ldquo;Pinto&rdquo; memo. He concluded, however, that the sedans and hatchbacks 
built from 1971 through 1976 did have an unsafe fuel tank and fuel filler tube 
design.</p> <br>

<p> The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case by Gary Schwartz was published in 1991, 
not 1981. And it is not the only work that has tackled the Pinto controversy. 
Douglas Birsch and John H. Fielder wrote an excellent book, &ldquo;The Ford 
Pinto Case,&rdquo; which covers many aspects of the controversy, and there have 
been many others. The wagon theory was not part of Schwartz&rsquo; paper and it 
sounds rather dubious to me overall. Even though he concludes that there was 
some unacceptable risk to the Pinto in terms of rear impacts with fire, I say 
that the overall number of these incidents is too tiny to really be 
statistically significant.</p> <br>

<li>  geeber <br>
April 18th, 2012 at 12:40 pm <br>

<p> You are correct, the article was published in 1991, not 1981.</p> 
<p>At any rate, one has to consider the number of Pinto wagons that were on 
the road, and their safer fuel tank and fuel-filler tube design, when looking 
at the Pinto&rsquo;s fire-related death rate as a result of rear collisions. If 
the wagons are included in the most of the calculations (and nothing I&rsquo;ve 
read leads me to conclude that they weren&rsquo;t), but this body style never 
had a problem with fuel tank or fuel-filler design, then that must be taken 
into consideration.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the wagons were specifically excluded from the 
government-mandated recall of 1971-76 Pintos.</p> 
<p>If you look footnote 76 on page 1032 of the Rutgers Law Review article, the 
fire-related death rate for 1973 Pintos in operations was well over twice that 
of other 1973 subcompacts. What&rsquo;s significant is that this figure 
specifically excluded the Pinto wagons for that year. Almost 1/3 of Pintos sold 
that model year were wagons &ndash; hardly an insubstantial percentage.</p> <br>

<p> There was no back seat in a Gremlin or a Beetle, just a padded bench that 
looked like a seat usable only for passengers without legs. The Pinto had two 
butt cups you plopped into backwards, like you are going to take a dump in a 
phone booth. The transmission hump between the two butt cups prevented a fun 
evening more effectively than an 82 year old Amish chapparone with a bull whip.
</p> 
<p>Once ensconced in said Pinto butt cup, your forward view was of the back of 
the front seats covered in Essence-of-Polychloride Faux Naugahyde straight from 
a chemical vat in a Czech lab where all the male workers had developed breasts 
from the hormones used to make the Pinto interior feel cheaper than a discount 
aisle at an abandoned KMart &ndash; but saved Ford fifty cents per yard.</p> 
<p>A Corolla was better because cardboard pine tree air freshners didn&rsquo;t 
burst into flames when hung from their rear view mirror, as they did in the 
Pintos, especially after they were rear ended by a blown shopping cart in an 
oil and transmission fluid stained Goldblatts parking lot in Calumet City, 
Illinois.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Pinto has gone the way of Lawn Jarts, Kent Micronite 
filters, and aluminum condoms.</p> <br>

<p> OK, I&rsquo;m glad to see I&rsquo;m not the only one who remembered that,

had to be a trust-fund baby to afford one of those. The Corollas and Datsun 
B210&prime;s were truckish, underpowered cramped little versions of bigger cars.
</p> 
<p>The Rabbit along with the Civic were almost radically different (at least 
in my part of the midwest), but the VW had the advantage of having a larger 
dealer network and good name recognition.</p> 
<p>My oldest brother graduated from university in 1975. His former roommate 
had a Rabbit, and my brother really liked the car. But post-college jobs being 
what they are and no credit history yet, he didn&rsquo;t qualify for the loan, 
so he ended up with a used car instead&hellip;</p> <br>

<p> 1975 Vega, Pinto, Datsun, Toyota were all crap mobiles compared to the 
under appreciated 1975 Opel Manta. It won hands down in all categories &ndash; 
body, paint, suspension, engine. While the aforementioned cars suffered the 
drivability horrors of primitive, power robbing emission controls, the Opel was 
equipped with Bosch L Jet Tronic, multiport fuel injection that met 1975 EPA 
regs without a catalytic converter. It never had warm up issues nor needed to 
be retuned for altitude. It was dead reliable too. I had the car for seven, 
rust free and trouble free years.<br>
 About a decade later, Detroit and Japan 
woke up and started using modern fuel injection.<br>
 And best of all, you 
bought it from a Buick dealer and not some thinly reformed, white collar 
criminal posing as a Toyota dealer.<br>

<p> While true that the list price was higher, I only paid $3800 for the 75 
Manta. I believe that Buick was offering an incentive as it was advertised at 
this price in a local paper. I remember that the Japanese dealers were charging 
above sticker for their less dsirable cars resulting in very little price 
difference. When adjusted for content and technology, I decided that the Manta 
was actually cheaper even though it was a class above the Corolla and one below 
the BMW that cost a lot more.</p> <br>

<p> $3,800 was still over a grand above a base Corolla, which had an MSRP of a 
little over $2,700 in 1975. Also, since 1975 was the last year that the 
German-built Opels were imported into the US and sales had collapsed due to the 
rising DM vs. dollar exchange rate, you probably got a clearance price from 
your dealer.</p> <br>

<p> Yes it was bit more upscale after all it was sold at Buick dealers. My dad 
had the Opel 1900 4 dr think of it as a poor mans 2002.</p> <br>

<p> Trolls deliberately try to piss people off. He formulates arguments at 
states them. The fact that you disagree with him doesn&rsquo;t make him a troll.

<p> I got a cherry in 1975 &ndash; that&rsquo;s ALL that I cared about. And in 
a 1975 Pontiac Ventura at that. Car was ugly as a fart in church and 
couldn&rsquo;t pull a greasy string out a cats butt. But, it did have soft 
cloth seats, ha, bet those &ldquo;stains&rdquo; are still there in a junk yard 
somewhere!</p> <br>

<p> My sister owned a 77 Corolla base model 1200cc 4 spd 2dr in grey. No 
carpet only rubber matting. The only option was an AM/FM radio. It had of all 
things a manual choke. Just pull it out when you started it and as the the 
engine idled it pushed itself back in. The car was quite reliable she got over 
150k out of it.</p> <br>

<p> Pinto Fan, you are a tool.</p> 
<p>Your arguments are beginning to sound like a broken record and that&rsquo;s 
not good.</p> 
<p>I grew up on large sized domestic sedans and my parents bought a &rsquo;76 
Honda Accord, and ended up with 2 more and Mom had one more after Dad died, and 
I had 2 used Hondas, they all served us well and without issues, other than the 
timing belt in the &rsquo;85 Accord breaking, fortunately, not on the upstroke 
as it was an interference motor so nothing other than a fresh belt/water pump 
was needed. Both of my Hondas got over 180K miles on them, and they 
would&rsquo;ve gone much more than that if neither of them had been rear ended. 
I grew up mostly with Mopar products and one of them was a &rsquo;64 Dodge 
station wagon with the 225 slant six, torqueflite auto and it lasted us until 
1977 with over 140K miles on it, and that was a RARE thing back when it was 
made, and in the 70&prime;s, most cars could get over 100K miles with no 
problem, 150K was considered the theoretical limit by the mid to late 
70&prime;s, now, 200K+ is common, with the Japanese being some of the first to 
go that much without a major rebuild &ndash; that was in the 80&prime;s as 
we&rsquo;ve seen many of these Japanese cars doing just that, with many 
beginning as early as the mid to late 70&prime;s where rust isn&rsquo;t an 
issue onwards.</p> 
<p>My parents and I got lucky as ALL of our cars were reasonably reliable but 
the Hondas were so much better put together than anything by Detroit up until 
more recent years.</p> 
<p>While I like the basic design of the Pinto, I know enough to know that it 
was nothing remotely as nice as what was coming out of Europe or Japan. Mom had 
a 76 Chevy Vega and it ended up being a decent car for the times, but it was 
SLOW, slower than that &rsquo;75 Corolla in fact and not nearly as fuel 
efficient I don&rsquo;t think and they were of similar size.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s become terribly sad that you have become so blind as to the 
truth about what had/has happened in the automotive industry that you feel 
compelled to defend to the death the poor Pinto despite it&rsquo;s major faults.
