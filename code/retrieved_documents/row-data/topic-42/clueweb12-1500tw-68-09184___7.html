<p></p> 
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> has launched a bold new global strategy that will 
see the Japanese automotive giant develop three all-new front-wheel-drive 
vehicle platforms and give more decision-making power to its chief engineers.
</p> 
<p>Called the &lsquo;Toyota New Global Architecture&rsquo;, the new framework 
will see advances in product appeal driven by engineers rather than accountants 
and other management members.</p> 
<p>Toyota is focusing on &ldquo;fortifying the authority of chief 
engineers&rdquo;, giving them greater capacity to identify consumer needs and 
pursue product improvements to address them.</p> 
<p>Cooperation between planning and design divisions will result in revised 
vehicle body structures with lower centres of gravity and bolder styling, 
leading to &ldquo;never-before-seen emotional designs and superb 
handling&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Toyota says it has also reduced the number of people who attend internal 
design review meetings, and is now giving chief engineers 
&ldquo;precedence&rdquo; in the review process, meaning there will be fewer 
people to tame original designs.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Toyota says the three new global front-wheel-drive platforms will underpin 
approximately half of its international sales. The platforms are expected to 
form the basis of the brand&rsquo;s next-generation light (Yaris), small 
(Corolla) and medium (Camry) vehicles.</p> 
<p>The shift to global vehicle platforms will lead to a reduction in 
development and production costs, with parts and core vehicle components to be 
shared extensively and suppliers to be involved early in the process.</p> 
<p>Despite the push to global vehicles, Toyota says it will focus on three key 
regions to meet the specific needs and preferences of consumers, appointing 
product planning general managers to North America and China; Japan and Europe; 
and Australia, Russia, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and emerging 
Asian markets.</p> 
<p>Toyota says the creation of three regional sectors will sharpen its 
responsiveness in launching new products and updates.</p> 
<p>The fruits of the new global strategy will begin to be seen in the coming 
years.</p>  &amp;lt;a

<p>I am sure 6 year olds with crayons could come up with more exciting cars 
that what we have seen in the past. This has to be good news.</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> foundry <br>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the problem with big automotive corporations, such as 
Toyota, the VW group, GM, etc, and the vicious cost-cutting competition amongst 
them that they&rsquo;re forced to partake in, which really does none of them 
any good. Good to see Toyota taking a bold step in the right direction. 
Hopefully the others will follow suit.</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> Legnab <br>

<p>Actually toyota are aping VW and FORD with the the GLOBAL platform , they 
have been practising this for years .</p> 
<p>Cost cutting is reality or you wont survive , come back in 10 years and 
some big brands will have gone by the wayside .</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> foundry <br>

<p>Well, then. All I can say is watch out VW and Ford.</p> </li> </ul> </ul>

<li> 440 R/T Charger <br>

<p>Let the accountants to build cars never works&hellip;they dont know what 
&ldquo;driving pleasure&rdquo; means.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Shak <br>

<p>Good news for lots of customers. Here&rsquo;s hoping they actually 
do&nbsp;something&nbsp;about the way Toyota vehicles drive, and not just 
re-design the&nbsp;exteriors.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Sherwin <br>

<p>So, if they put the Toyota GT-86 platform on a Corolla, with a few 
modifications, well now that could be something special.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> Kaas <br>

<p>But why would the Corolla need the 86 platform?</p> 
<p>It is one of the best selling cars in the world the way it is now&hellip;. 
Toyota has NO REASON to change platform&hellip;. the Corolla has a market and 
it is doing fine for Toyota.</p> 
<p>Toyota has the 86 to cover the sub-40K (AUD) Sports car&hellip;<br>
 For 
them the Lexus IS350 is the &ldquo;next&rdquo; Toyota performance car which 
retails for 80K (AUD)&hellip;</p> 
<p>It makes sense to make a 60-70K Coupe (IS350 is luxury Sedan after 
all)&hellip; remove unnecessary luxury (leather seats, computer control aid 
etc) And put a supercharger on the 3.5 V6 (IS350 engine)&hellip;.. from 221kW 
to 275kW&hellip;&hellip;</p> 
<p>Thats the thinking that is realistic&hellip; because there&rsquo;s a need 
for that car in that segment&hellip; a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; corolla is 
moot&hellip;. 99% of people who buy them aren&rsquo;t into fast cars.. but 
practicality and affordability, with a little style (hatch Corolla)</p> </li> 
</ul> 
<li> Parma&amp;Pot&hellip;. <br>

<p>Lets hope we start seeing some better suspension/tire set ups&hellip;maybe 
even some small capacity turbos?</p> </li> 
<li> Robin_Graves <br>

<p>About time. Toyota was built on over engineering and has been really held 
back by beancounters in the last 10 years. &nbsp;Look at the latest HiLux 
variant, hardly unbreakable anymore.</p> </li> </ul> <br>
