<h2> Which car is more UU: Subaru Outback or Toyota Prius? </h2> 
<p>by Philocrites</p> 
<p>On the heels of the Los Angeles Times story that said that &quot;Subaru is 
the Unitarian Church of automotive brands,&quot; the Fresno Bee says that one 
UU congregation begs to differ:Twenty-three people at the Unitarian 
Universalist Church of Fresno, California, drive Toyota Priuses. 
That's&nbsp;approximately 10% of the church's households! Happy Earth Day, 
everyone.</p>

<p>LOL! Ditto for Portland liberals. We're a town of either Subaru Outbacks or 
Toyota Prius'. (Well, there are those suburban Republicans who drive Ford 
Explorers, but they're *Republicans* so what can you do?) ;)</p>

<p>My vote is for the Prius. I just wish I could afford one. Now there's a car 
that deserves a tax break. :)</p>

<p>I drive a Subaru, but she's older than the Outback.(1990) I want a Prius. 
They're not expensive as cars go, just too much for us in this bad economy.<br>

 Much as I am attached to my (second)Subaru, I think the Prius is more the UU 
car of choice. There are several of them in my congregation -- including the 
minister.</p>

<p>Both. Depends which strain of UUism is represented.</p> 
<p>The Subaru is more old-fashioned 19th-century UU, in the tradition of 
Channing, Emerson, and Thoreau: it's a rational, durable, reliable, 
value-priced purchase that can carry you through all kinds of bad weather and 
get you out into Nature when you need to lie down in green pastures and walk 
beside still waters.</p> 
<p>The Prius is more 1970's, introspective, post-Woodstock UU: it's so darned 
righteous and energy-conserving and self-image-affirming that its owners are 
willing to overlook the fact that it is actually priced<i>higher</i> than the 
present value of all the gas it will save, and you can't fit more than two 
grocery bags into it without squishing the bread.</p>

<p>Hahaha, We're about to roll over 100,000 miles on the Subaru Forester and 
I'm coveting all of the Prius's in the parking lot at the Fellowship. I can't 
afford it though, not without selling my soul...which maybe I could do, hmmm!

<p>fausto -- the Prius is not priced any higher than a Subaru. And there's 
quite a bit of room in the back -- not as much as a stationwagon, but it has 
the advantage over the usual hatchback in that there is no lip on the back so 
you can slide things in. We rented one to drive to Oregon in October to help 
get out the vote, and our four suitcases and totebags etc. fit in the back with 
no problem. The next trip they were out of Priuses so we ended up with an 
upgrade to a Mercedes -- and we had more trouble getting the luggage in there.
<br> The point isn't to save enough money to make it pay some mythical amount, 
it's to pollute less so we can all breathe.<br>
 Don't be bitter. </p>

<p>The perfect fusion of both is the 2005 Ford Escape Hybrid. It's a better 
compact for snow and off-road driving than the Subaru, plus it's got a 
gas-sipping hybrid engine like the Prius.</p> 
<p>Me, I'm hoping Ford's Mazda subsidiary comes out with a twin Mazda Tribute 
hybrid model before my 1995 Saab gives up the ghost. The Tribute has a sport 
package that looks like it might be more fun to drive.</p> 
<p>The Ford website even has a calculator to help you figure your annual fuel 
savings if you buy the hybrid. Guess what? Like Toyota, Ford charges more for 
the hybrid upgrade than the fuel savings are worth. Buy an Escape hybrid (or a 
Prius), and you'll be like my friend &quot;Jeremiah's&quot; orthodox Quaker 
college classmate who used to pay extra in the 1950's and '60's to custom-order 
his new cars without so much chrome, because ostentatious show was against his 
religion. Nothing wrong with that, but let's be honest and call it what it is. 
(Incidentally, to compare the prices of the Outback and Prius is misleading. 
You can buy a similarly-equipped Toyota Corolla with pretty respectable mileage 
for a<i>lot</i> less than what you have to pay for a Prius, but you can't buy a 
Prius with the Outback's all-wheel drive at any price.)</p> 
<p>If you don't need the hybrid feature, Ford is offering $2,000 cash-back 
incentives on the standard-model Escape, and Mazda is offering $3,000 on the 
Tribute. Both will give you even more cash back if you choose factory 
financing. As William Ellery &quot;Prove All Things&quot; Channing would have 
noted, that pays for a lot of fill-ups, and with those incentives somebody's 
going to drive that car off the lot and burn that gas whether it's you or not.

<p>I vote for Prius, even though it doesn't actually make sense from a 
financial perspective, it is far more friendly to God's earth than the Subaru 
because it is has much cleaner emissions.</p>

<p>We were thinking about getting a Prius, but then we read the NYTimes 
Article from Feb 8, 2006 &quot;Buy a Hybrid, Save a Gas Guzzler&quot; and had 
second thoughts. It is an archived story now so it can't be linked to 
full-text. Here is an excerpt.</p> 
<p>&quot;Buy a Hybrid, Save a Gas Guzzler&quot;<br>
 by David Leonhardt</p> 
<p>...Too bad the benefits of our new cult car have been so exaggerated.... 
government policy, amazingly enough, seems almost intended to undercut the 
benefits of efficient cars. In 1978, Congress set a minimum corporate average 
fuel economy, known as CAFE, for all carmakers. Today, the minimum average for 
cars is 27.5 miles a gallon. (For S.U.V.'s and other light trucks, it is 21.6.)
</p> 
<p>YOU can guess what this means for hybrids. Each one becomes a free pass for 
its manufacturer to sell a few extra gas guzzlers...Instead of simply saving 
gas when you buy a hybrid, you're giving somebody else the right to use it.</p> 
<p>The hybrid, then, is just about the perfect example of what's wrong with 
our energy policy.... As Jon Coifman, the media director of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, says, ''We're not going to kick our oil addiction 
with good will and personal virtue. You do need market signals, and you do need 
rules. And you need virtue. You need it all.''...</p> 
<p>...A substantial gas tax would be the simplest, with other taxes being cut 
to keep down the overall burden. Car buyers could drive whatever they wanted, 
as long as they were paying the full cost of their gas, and automakers would 
respond with creative products....</p> <br>
