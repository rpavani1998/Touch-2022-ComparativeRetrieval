<h2> Better together? Ford and Toyota team up</h2> 
<p>31 de agosto de 2011</p> 
<p>San Antonio.- <em><strong>Last week, the Ford Motor Company and Toyota 
Corporation announced a new collaboration to develop an advanced hybrid system 
for light trucks and SUVs. Both companies plan to participate equally in the 
project to hasten the product to market &ndash; the new vehicles will also have 
state-of-the-art telematics and internet services on board &ndash; but 
don&rsquo;t expect anything until later &ldquo;this decade.&rdquo;</strong></em>

<p>The collaboration begins with a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by 
both companies on the product development collaboration, with a formal 
agreement expected by next year.</p> 
<p>Ford and Toyota have been working independently on their own 
future-generation rear-wheel drive hybrid systems. But to accelerate the 
product to markets and to make them more affordable, the companies teamed up as 
equal partners on the new hybrid system, which is based on a new hybrid 
powertrain.</p> 
<p>The hope is that the new technology will allow customers the full hybrid 
experience, including better fuel efficiency, while keeping intact all the 
capability they require in their vehicles. It also brings both companies closer 
to the 50 plus mpg average fuel economy standard the Obama administration wants 
all companies to adhere to by 2025.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders 
in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more 
quickly and affordably for our customers,&rdquo; Derrick Kuzak, Ford group vice 
president of the Global Product Development division, said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Ford achieved a breakthrough with the Ford Fusion Hybrid, and we 
intend to do this again for a new group of truck and SUV buyers &ndash; 
customers we know very well,&rdquo; he added.<br>
 His Toyota counterpart 
agrees wholeheartedly.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In 1997, we (Toyota) launched the first-generation Prius, the 
world&rsquo;s first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid. Since then, we have 
sold about 3.3 million hybrid vehicles. We expect to create exciting 
technologies that benefit society with Ford &ndash; and we can do so through 
the experience the two companies have in hybrid technology,&rdquo; Takeshi 
Uchiyamada, Toyota executive vice president, Research &amp; Development, said:
</p> 
<p>The two companies also agreed to work together on enablers to complement 
each company&rsquo;s existing telematics platform standards, helping bring more 
Internet-based services and useful information to consumers globally.</p> 
<p>Telematics is an industry term that refers to systems in cars that can 
combine wireless communication with GPS tracking and any number of 
telecommunication functions that originate or end inside automobiles.</p> 
<p>Under the MOU agreement, both companies will contribute their best research 
-- the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and 
knowledge -- to a new co-developed hybrid system to be used in rear-wheel-drive 
light trucks arriving later this decade.</p> 
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean Ford-Toyota vehicles will be gracing the 
highways and byways &ndash; all the new tech will be under the hood. While the 
rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will share significant common technology and 
components, Ford and Toyota will individually adapt the system into their own 
vehicles. Each company also will determine the calibration and performance 
dynamics characteristics of their respective light pickups and SUVs.</p> 
<p>The idea to work together to improve the hybrid technology is a way to 
leverage their knowledge to improve the trucks faster. For years, both Ford and 
Toyota were independently working on the same idea, to extend the real benefits 
of hybrid technology where consumers needed it most - light trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By working together, we will be able to serve our customers with the 
very best affordable, advanced powertrains, delivering even better fuel 
economy,&rdquo; Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally said. &ldquo;This is the 
kind of collaborative effort that is required to address the big global 
challenges of energy independence and environmental sustainability.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Toyota President Akio Toyoda added, &ldquo;Toyota is extremely proud to 
join Ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and SUVs. Not only is 
this tie-up clearly one aimed at making automobiles ever better, it should also 
become an important building block for future mobility in the U.S. By building 
a global, long-term relationship with Ford, our desire is to be able to 
continue to provide people in America automobiles that exceed their 
expectations.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Together, the companies are striving for &nbsp;all-new architecture to 
deliver the capability truck and SUV customers demand, including greater fuel 
economy.</p> 
<p>Also, as telematics plays an increasingly more important role in the in-car 
experience, both companies have agreed to collaborate on standards and 
technologies needed to enable a safer, more secure and more convenient in-car 
experience for next-generation telematics systems. The telematics collaboration 
relates only to standards and technologies, and each company will continue to 
separately develop their own in-vehicle products and features.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Ford has made tremendous progress in the area of telematics,&rdquo; 
Kuzak said. &ldquo;We have unique and very good solutions today with SYNC and 
MyFordTouch. Working together on in-vehicle standards can only enhance our 
customers&rsquo; experience with their vehicles.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The company&rsquo;s leaders share the same vision &ndash; an accelerated 
path to the technology that will allow their respective trucks and SUVs to be 
as efficient as possible and that will allow both companies to be the cutting 
edge of the unfolding telematics revolution for vehicles, without sacrificing 
their individual brands and progress to date.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We expect to create exciting and socially beneficial technologies 
with Ford, and we can do so because our two companies have enough experience to 
create a synergy effect in hybrid technology and in telematics. At the same 
time, we will compete harder than ever in the spirit of &ldquo;making great 
cars.&rdquo; Our competitive stance will help maximize benefits for customers 
and for society at large. We are counting on this collaboration between Toyota 
and Ford to benefit American society and to open a new page in the history of 
the world automobile industry. As an engineer, I will be deeply gratified to 
see us fulfill those aims,&rdquo; Uchiyamada added.</p>
