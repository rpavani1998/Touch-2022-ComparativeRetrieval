<h1>Thread of the Day: Which Out-of-Production Car Would You Still Buy Today?

<p>Many automotive models have come and gone, but sometimes a certain car 
becomes so iconic, its successor can&rsquo;t live up to the high standard 
&mdash; or the memorable car is discontinued altogether.</p> 
<p><em>Motor Trend</em> forum member <strong>400calvin</strong> says his 
favorite car built was the second-generationHonda CRX Si. He thought its size, 
styling, and powertrain were the perfect blend of performance and style for 
him&mdash;especially in red and black with mag wheels and a sunroof.</p> 
<p>Other forum members listed the Buick GNX, Fiero GT, last-generation Acura 
TL, 1970 Chevelle SS 454 LS6,Pontiac G8 GT, 1993-1998 Toyota Supra, GMC 
Syclone, and 1961Lincoln Continental, as the cars they would buy if they were 
still in production.</p> 
<p><strong>400calvin</strong> only has three stipulations: the car can no 
longer be in production and it must have the same styling and powertrain 
offered when originally built.<strong>So which car would you buy if it were 
still in production?</strong></p>

<p>Ok, this is my own selfish opinion. </p> 
<p>1989-97 Thunderbirds &hellip; a well built cat that should have been 
revised.</p> 
<p>1968 Caillac Sedan Deville , thought the car was just perfect in every way.
</p> 
<p>1970-76 Dodge Crestwood Station Wagon &ndash; I just remember how looked I 
thought they were cool.</p> 
<p>68&prime; Chevelle- one mean looking car.</p> 
<p>Pontiac G8 and Saturn Aura &ndash; both solid built and were the reasons 
why GM could have made them work.</p> 
<p>Buicks from 65-71 &ndash; they were just classy man had terrific lines and 
interiors were interesting.</p> 
<p>Oldsmobiles 60-77 &ndash; again they were at the top of there game when the 
GM divisions were seperately ran.</p> 
<p>Olds Aurora &ndash; 2nd generation wow 6 cylinder or 4.0L 8 &hellip;. those 
cars gave Olds a reason to stay around even though the rest of the line up in 
that era just didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p> 
<p>We all realize the Firebird can&rsquo;t ever make a return so sad&hellip;.. 
the 70-74 I thought they were sinister.</p> 
<p>I realize there are no imports so uh&hellip;. here!<br>
 Mitsubishi 
Conquest &ndash; no I don&rsquo;t have a year but these were some FAST cars for 
there day.<br>
 Mitsubishi &hellip; THE ONE BEFORE THE ECLIPSE 89-94 they were 
small cars with turbos and these little s.o.b.s blew the doors off of mustangs 
camaros and pretty much anything come in there crosshairs.<br>
 Mustang 69- 
What a nice looking car that doesn&rsquo;t get all that much attn.<br>
 Mustang 
87-93 alot of motor for very little dough &ndash;<br>
 Well thats my list I 
know not impressive but I don&rsquo;t think you can argue it.</p> <br>

<p>Now this WOT has the most comments.</p> 
<p>Most likely an old Zagato. Or Shelby Cobra. Or pontiac G8. Or ferrari Enzo. 
Or Lamborghini Murcielago. Or an Acura NSX. Or a Lamborghini Diablo GTR. Or, 
or, the most amazing one, the FORD GT SUPERCAR!!! Price don&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>The Rodeo was a terrible truck (gasket leaks galore and rusty frames). I 
say this from experience because I work for Honda and they unfortunately 
rebadged the Rodeo as a Passport.</p> <br>

<p>what about 97 mitsu GST turbo!! i used to spank anything that wasnt a acura 
type r!! i even raced a c5 vette it was the best race ever!! i didnt win but i 
didnt lose!! i remember getting on to the freeway in seceond about to shift to 
3rd when i heard the rumble of the niebhor hood 91 5.0 (sick ass mustang) so i 
held 2nd to about 8000rpm and never saw the mustang only in my mirrior!!! it 
was 210bhp stock but i had a trust intercooler, higher flow injectors, 3inch 
exhuast, k&amp;n, and really big sticker across the doors (bigger than the 
doors actually) it said TRUST. I trusted that i could be just about any car!!! 
except those pesky type Rs.</p> <br>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think the GST could rev up to 8k rpm (unless you had 
upgraded valesprings/retainers). As far as a modded GST not being able to keep 
up with a type R..well thats just rediculous.</p> <br>

<p>GMC Yukon/Chevy Tahoe 2-DOOR! They were very capable, and gave the feeling 
of a full-size/safe vehicle in a much more compact/shorter length. Plus 
I&rsquo;m sure with modern technology &ndash; weight saving materials and more 
efficient engines &ndash; they should be able to muster some better gas 
milage&hellip;.then again it is GM, the product would take a decade to be 
released and the US probably wouldn&rsquo;t get it anyway!!!</p> 
<p>So guess I&rsquo;ll change my wants to &ldquo;2-door SUV&rsquo;s&rdquo; in 
general. Land Rover Evoque is awesome&hellip;except it&rsquo;s way too 
expensive for the general public. A 2-door Durango or Grand Cherokee would be 
sweet!</p> <br>

 88-92 honda civic<br>
 
92-96 toyota camry -one of the best before toyota de-contented it and wrecked 
what they had<br>

<p>Ok here&rsquo;s my two cents, which may make less sense.</p> 
<p>I learned to drive on my dads 2-door 86 Escort GT. It was silver metallic 
with black lower skirt and sills. It had A/C, a trip computer, a system 
function test with little lightbulbs on a graphic that could tell you if any 
light was burned out, 15&Prime; aluminum wheels, a 5 speed stick, and some of 
the coolest seats and trim I&rsquo;ve seen. The cam cover said &ldquo;1.9 
HO&rdquo; on it, which my dad told me meant &ldquo;High Output.&rdquo; Looking 
back, I realize my dad was driving one of the first hot hatches, and I still 
remember it as a hoot. It had Ford Premium Sound (lol) but what was impressive 
was that it had a head unit with mechanical tuning dials&hellip; and mechanical 
presets. Pull tab out, tune to station, press in until it clicks, and there you 
have it- one of your 5 presets has been &ldquo;programmed.&rdquo; This car was 
in the family for 11 years, during which time the only repair outside of 
scheduled maintenance was a replacement of the distributor cap. Not bad for 
reliability. So as I think back to what made me into the stick-driving, car 
loving guy I am today, I realize it was influenced a lot by my parents (both of 
whom are into cars) and this Escort in particular. I just picked up a &rsquo;12 
Focus, but if that Escort was available new (only assuming that safety and 
convenience items were kept current) I would have driven it off the lot 
instead. I loved the boxy look, standard FOX racing fog lights, and the seat 
fabric and trim to name a few reasons to buy. And interestingly, I distinctly 
recall liberal use of materials that were soft and squishy. The entire upper 
dash was a vinyl coated foam pad, and the graining was impressive. The lower 
door panel continued the high-pile carpet up about 8 inches from the bottom, 
and the whole door panel itself was covered in padded vinyl. Fast forward a few 
years, and everything rolling out of a final assembly facility was crafted from 
Lego materials inside. From the attention to detail, to the futuristic system 
monitor and trip computer, through the mechanical presets and Volvo-esque 
hollow head restraints, and finally the tire smoking 5 speed stick, this silver 
2-door 86 Escort GT will always be the car that got me into cars, taught me how 
to use three pedals before I even much noticed so many cars had two, and served 
as a reminder during the 90s that American car companies certainly were capable 
of making a desirable small car. I&rsquo;m glad I had that memory to hold onto 
while scoffing at the automotive excrement that dropped into dealerships for 15 
years until so recently.</p> 
<p>Thanks for sticking with me, I hope my little ballad of Escort GT love has 
sparked a memory or stirred up your own emotions over your first car love 
affair. I know I could write for days about that car, but I won&rsquo;t do it 
here for your sake.</p> 
<p>RIP Escort GT, rhyme not intended.</p> <br>

<p>One of many stupid moves the GM &ldquo;brand management&rdquo; idiots 
inflicted on Pontiac before they pulled the plug was changing the name of their 
sporty mid sizes to the moronic G6 (for the Grand Am) and the G8 (for the Grand 
Prix as well as the full size Bonneville) . The sheer stupidity and utter 
incompetence of GM&rsquo;s executives is shown by the fact that in both 2004 
(when Oldsmobile got the ax ) and 2009 (when they did in the proud Indian), the 
division they were killing had never LOST money, while the three divisions they 
kept (Saab, Saturn and Hummer) had never MADE money under GM management.</p>

<p>Did i ask for your comment. I could care less what you think. Dont you dare 
sit here and accuse GM of doing what every other automanufacturer has done in 
the past. Almost all automanufacturers in the past have dropped different brand 
names and have changed the name of their cars for certain reasons and there is 
nothing wrong with this being done. Heck, just think. Although GM has dropped 
five brands over the past decade, its still the best selling automaker in the 
world. Looks like GM is doing something right. Go GM.</p> <br>

<p>GM is not the world&rsquo;s largest automaker, GM lied about that.</p> 
<p>More than half of GM&rsquo;s claimed sales in China were actually non-GM 
small delivery vans built by SAIC-Wuling, the Chinese State-owned company that 
GM has a partnership with. GM counted 1,285,820 vehicles sold by SAIC-Wuling 
that GM didn&rsquo;t have a controlling interest in, didn&rsquo;t design, and 
didn&rsquo;t produce.</p> 
<p>VW clearly won the worldwide sales race, hands down. Look, I&rsquo;m not 
defending VW, I don&rsquo;t even like VW. I&rsquo;m just saying that VW won and 
GM lied.</p> <br>

<p>nobody ask for your not only stupid ass comment but incorrect either, and 
brand dropping is what happens when you go bankrupt. GM is barely even making 
there money back on there investments, we&rsquo;re talking less than .01% 
profit, compared to the money they invested. Ford is not the best, but they 
turn out the biggest profit out of the relavent car companys, which means 
people want to buy them for what ford is asking for, and thats not cheap. GM is 
giving them away because it wasnt even there money in the first place and since 
Obama had his hands involved in it, im sure lots of people want him to fail. 
Just because hes Obama. going bankrupt is doing something right??? ONLY IN 
AMERICA!!!</p> <br>

<p>&ldquo;Almost all automanufacturers in the past have dropped different 
brand names and have changed the name of their cars for certain reasons and 
there is nothing wrong with this being done&rdquo; Correct, except for the FACT 
that COMPETENTLY run companies drop brands that are LOSING money (as Saturn, 
Saab and Hummer did for EVERY YEAR of their existence under GM control) , not 
MAKING it (as Oldsmobile and Pontiac did for EVERY YEAR of their 106 and 83 
year long existences). The fact GM is still selling vehicles and making profits 
is in SPITE of GM management (with a little help from Govco. bailouts that DID 
NOTHING to address their myriad labor and management issues), not because of it.

RWD 4Cyl sports car that has a current cult following? Such a great car! Bring

<p>Nissans of that era were very well engineered. Nice tight gaps in the body, 
solid sounding doors, clean interiors. I remember being in an Altima in the 
early 90&prime;s and thinking, damn this is a nice car. Maximas back then were 
true affordable luxury. My girlfriend&rsquo;s dad had a Nissan with voice, 
&ldquo;Door is ajar&rdquo;. Seemed so futuristic. Good post.</p> <br>

<p>This deserved a second LOL. The loss of Saab is something we should all be 
mourning. Anyone who cares enough about the automotive world to get involved 
with a thread like this should lament both the initial sale of Saab to GM, then 
it&rsquo;s ignorance in treating the brand like everything else it owned, and 
then finally trying to both offload it and still control who it goes to to 
avoid giving up its intellectual property. News flash: Car companies buy 
competitors products ad tear them apart all the time. Nothing in the potential 
sale could have given a buyer what they couldn&rsquo;t have found out for 
themselves- or already knew. Very arrogant to assume that manufacturers the 
world over want to get their hands on cutting edge GM technology, and would 
rather buy a worthwhile brand for millions of dollars than stroll into a GM 
dealer and just buy one or two cars to disassemble. So, yes, LOL, but 
it&rsquo;s the sad, sarcastic kind. I&rsquo;ll miss seeing a new Saab soon, 
whenever I realize a new one should have been rolling out and isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>It was initially only suposed to be a very limited run, but its initial 
success led Honda to keep building them. By the time it came to start planning 
a clean-sheet redesign it was 2008, the economy had tanked, gas prices were 
high (for the US) and only a few thousand S2000&prime;s were being sold 
globally. They let production run until updated government safety measurements 
meant Honda had to put development dollars into the car, and the plug was 
pulled. Sad day.. I love my AP2.</p> <br>

<p>The tricky part is the original powertrain for me. I like so many icons 
already mentined, but I don&rsquo;t like their old engines, because they are 
weak, and many have carboraters, and I&rsquo;m not wasting my time with those. 
I will say that nothing sounds like these old engines, but they just are more 
trouble then they&rsquo;re worth for me. If I could change only the engine to 
anything I wanted and keep everything else the same, it would be..<br>
