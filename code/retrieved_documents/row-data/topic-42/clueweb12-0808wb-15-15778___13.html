<p> Keep sending your money to Japan Brother, they appreciate it. I believe we 
are in debt as a nation about 9 1/2 Trillion dollars right now, most of it owed 
to Japan and China, so keep sending them money and hurting American companies 
if it makes you feel good. Myself, I will do business with companies that are 
American and keep the money I spend at home. Toyota trucks are 
&quot;better&quot;, better how? Better to go to the mall in? Don't run that BS 
on me Son, I have been working trucks hard on a pipeline right of way for 30 
years. American trucks can stand up to any truck made anywhere. This is our 
country, these are our trucks. GM, Ford, Dodge. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Better like the fact that they build toyotas in the USA unlike the big 3 
who build their trucks in Mexico and Canada. Toyota actually pays the american 
worker, instead of using cheap labor. Also toyota trucks have umm.. I don't 
know more power, more torque,and can tow more. &nbsp; TOYOTA TRUCKS #1 &nbsp;

<p> They used to build Tundras in Indiana, not anymore, the Texas Tundra plant 
is shut down at this time. They build F Series trucks in Louisville, Ky. 
Norfork, Va Dearborn, Mi, Kansas City, Mo. and Mexico GM Trucks are built in 
Flint, Mi. Fort Wayne In, Pontiac, Mi, Canada and Mexico Dodge builds pickups 
in Fenton Mo,Warren Mi and Mexico. Do I wish they were all built here, yes, but 
the money spent on these trucks goes to American companies, not a Japanese 
company. To many Americans, that makes a difference, to some it doesn't, they 
feel good about giving their money to a foreign company. GM announced today 
they are building a new engine plant in Flint Michigan. Bravo! An American 
company creating good American jobs! This is our country, these are our trucks, 
GM,Ford,Dodge. &nbsp;<br>

<p> I buy a truck for utility.<br>
The dealer said the tundra crew cab doesn't 
come with a bench in the front. &nbsp;My f150 does. &nbsp;Many a time I had the 
bed full and and had to stick stuff in the back with the seats up. &nbsp;So the 
third passenger sits up in the middle. &nbsp;A center console in a truck is a 
complete waste of space. &nbsp; It adds nothing and takes away from 
functionality. &nbsp;(Plus benches are great for the little lady when she wants 
to get closer to me on a long drive home) &nbsp;<br>

<p> There are things that you all didn't take in consideration. &nbsp;Other 
then the truck being powerful and quick, the chassis/fit and finish/quality 
aren't on par with other trucks. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Where as all full-size trucks 
are now on a fully boxed frame, the Toyota still runs on a C-Channel setup. 
&nbsp;If you go over bumps, you can watch the bed flex (which is probably the 
reason for the recall on the tail-lights since they were cracking). &nbsp;<br>

<br>The interior in my opinion is the ugliest thing out there, and the quality 
of the truck is just plain bad. &nbsp;Camshaft failures in the Toyota??? 
&nbsp;That's bad. &nbsp;Ford/GM/Dodge have no where near as much problems as 
the truck. &nbsp;In fact, have you ever tried loading a four-wheeler in the 
bed? &nbsp;Most in my town who the truck have had their tail-gate fall off. 
&nbsp;It couldn't even support the weight. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now I would admit, 
the older Tundras (previous generation) are well built all round but the new 
Tundras are just plain terrible compared to the older ones, not to mention I 
find the styling inside and out to be just plan ugly. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Then it was built in Texas. They will never build them in Indiana again, 
they are taking out the line due to poor sales. They have idled the Texas plant 
due to poor sales, but will re-start it when they get rid of excess inventory. 
The same thing is happenening at GM,Ford,and Chrysler. The pickup market in 
general is not good due to gas prices. I want you to understand I do not think 
a Toyota is a bad vehicle. I just prefer doing business with a company that is 
American. My last bass boat was rigged on the showroom floor with a Yamaha 
motor. I told the dealer I will take the boat, but I want a Mercury motor on 
it. A Yamaha is a good engine, but so is a Mercury and they are an American 
company. I think it matters. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Yea i just want to agree with the guy on the previous page, the one who 
said that the toyotas just cant stand up to the day to day hauling and work 
that a truck needs to. &nbsp;I only own a little 1998 v-6 dakota, but with it 
ive hauled more pounds then 90% of toyota tundra owners ever will. &nbsp;My bed 
is all dented,bent, and mis shapen but i have not had any serious crippling 
problems yet. its just a great truck. &nbsp;but what gets me is the face that i 
need a bigger truck from the loads i carry but this little thing handles it 
just fine, then i see some *** in a big bad toyota tundra with a bed that he 
polishes every week (whoever polished their bed should throw thier truck away). 
it just makes no sence to have a truck with so mush power and not use half of 
it. &nbsp;<br>
and to the guy who says his tundra is faster then any other 
truck i say this,<br>
Trucks are geared lower to be able to haul larger loads 
with smaller engines, (my dakota will accelerate the exact same with an air 
commpresser and tool box in the bed as it will empty, even though that 
acceleration is not that great) but when u say ur tundra is so fast, its 
because they put a higher geared transmission in it and it has speed yes, but 
it needs that larger engine to produce the same power as the smaller engined 
equivalents, therefore more gas, and an overworked engine. &nbsp;<br>
Im an 
american truck buyer, not because i am &quot;Loyal to the american 
bussiness&quot; but becasue they make a product that will last for the long 
haul, not some vanity truck, that &quot;rides nice&quot; and &quot;looks pretty 
on the inside&quot; thats girl talk &nbsp;<br>

<p> American trucks can stand up to any truck built anywhere. Buy one, help 
America. It matters. This is our country, these are our trucks, GM, Ford,

<p> There is a lot of hate for the Tundra, and there are a few reasons why.. 
Right off the top, you are always going to have the &ldquo;Remember Pearl 
Harbor&rdquo; factor.. As far as I`m concerned, I would love a Pearl Harbor 
edition Tundra, bullet holes n` all.<br>
 &nbsp; Then you have the 
&ldquo;real&rdquo; Americans that just have to &ldquo;buy American&rdquo; 
because buying an American car is good for America.. Thats why you bought your 
Dodge that was made by skilled Mexican workers. Where did your money go? To the 
company and the workers.. Just the people that needed the money right? Help 
save us from the recession, Don`t buy that Toyota! It`s not good for the 
skilled American craftsman that build it.<br>
 &nbsp;I drive a 2000 Tundra SR5 
4x2 V-8 with 189,000 miles on the clock. I just had the 3rd timing belt put in, 
along with a new water pump. Besides the timing belt and water pump, the only 
other things that have needed to be fixed since my father bought it in `99 are 
the starter @145,000 and overdrive &amp; torque converter @ 138,000. (The 
reason for only od &amp; tq converter is my trans guy said the other 3 gears 
were &ldquo;like new&rdquo;). Why put in a new trans when you don`t need it? 
&nbsp;That`s the maintenance record so far, besides oil changes, 2 sets of 
spark plugs, numerous trans services (every 25,000), 4 sets of shocks, 1 set of 
sway bar links and poly bushings up front, 3 sets of rotors &amp; pads, the 
drums &amp; shoes are original.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;From the factory, the 
suspension was a little lacking I thought.. So I installed Firestone Ride Rite 
airbags in the back before the truck was 2 years old. The front end was always 
way too soft for my liking, especially with 500 lbs or more in the back.. I 
found a deal in Performance products on a set of H&amp;R progressive springs 
and 4 Bilstein 5100 shock absorbers.. Had them put on @ 184,000 miles. 
&nbsp;Suspension problems cured.. &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;Here I am now, less than 6 
months away from 200,000 miles and I can see yet another reason why so many 
people just hate the Tundra`s &nbsp;friggin`guts! Stories like mine&hellip; 
They wish they could get 180,000 miles out of a water pump, a front wheel 
bearing, alternator, transmission, or a rear end. They should have bought a 
Tundra.<br>
 &nbsp; Can you believe those idiots at Toyota!? They have to copy 
everybody else! Dodge makes a 5.7 liter Hemi, Toyota makes a 5.7 liter that 
outperforms it and gets better gas mileage.. Blah blah.. Toyota copied Dodge, 
blah blah.. Toyota copied Ford with the outboard shock absorbers, blah blah. 
How about the fact that the domestics are now copying Toyota and Honda with 
VVT? You don`t hear about that much.. What about Dodge copying Toyota`s 5.7 
liter with VVT? Haven`t heard much about that yet.. Doubt I will.. &nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp; Bottom line is: There is a lot of people who do not like the Tundra, 
most of them don`t have a leg to stand on because they have never owned one or 
drove one for 200,000 trouble free miles. Maybe they don`t have a leg to stand 
on because they lost it in Pearl Harbor, either way, I`m going to run my Tundra 
into the ground. And when I send it off to scrap, I`ll be right back at the 
Toyota dealer buying another Tundra. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

<p> In the past 6 years I have owned a Chevy K1500 (Silverado, sorry), a 
Nissan Titan and now a 2008 Ford F-150. &nbsp;I also owned a T-100 way back in 
the day before the Chevy.<br>
<br>
All three were great trucks, honestly. 
&nbsp;I had no complaints with any of them. &nbsp;The Chevy was a great all 
around truck, did what it was asked altho' the payload capacity was not all 
that great.<br>
<br>
The Titan had an engine/transmission combination that put 
a lot of power to the pavement, and while the ride was a bit harsh it, again, 
did what was expected of it.<br>
<br>
My F-150 has a good ride, decent power 
(5.4), handles well despite feeling like a tank. &nbsp;So far it too has done 
all that has been asked of it.<br>
<br>
My PERSONAL preference of the three is 
the Ford simply because it really is built to take a beating, not to drag race. 
&nbsp;I have not tried a new Silverado, or a new Dodge. &nbsp;When I bought my 
Chevy I had not been impressed with the Dodge (did test drive one) but I hear 
the previous generation (to the current coming out) was quite good.<br>
<br>
My 
mileage in ALL of my trucks has ranged from 16 MPG to 20 MPG, depending on what 
I was doing on any given tank.<br>
<br>
As far as owning/driving foreign 
vehicles... my wife is a Toyota lover. &nbsp;All of her cars have been 
Toyotas... and she drives them to the ground. &nbsp;Starting with her first 
car, a Tercel, then a Rav 4, now an Avalon. &nbsp;Never had a problem with any 
of them, and I have never had a problem with any of my trucks.<br>
<br>

Honestly I think that for LIGHT DUTY any of the trucks in that class will not 
out right fail in their role. &nbsp;The Titan and Tundra are both built here... 
so Americans are paid to build them. &nbsp;My Ford was built in Kansas.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just think that NONE of the trucks are junk and will all serve their 
purpose. &nbsp;<br>

<p> because it has potential and is quite a success. is it any different in 
the human world.remember &nbsp;only with its redesign &nbsp;was it ever a 
contender to challenge the domestics. what do you expect ,in fact &nbsp;the 
sheer negetivity is really a sign of &nbsp;nervousness in some circles of its 
potential.<br>
<br>
<br>
have we all forgotten &nbsp;that &nbsp;competition is 
to obtain a better product and introduce variety.. do we see everything as a Us 
&nbsp;vs &nbsp;them(ie foreign) issue... despite &nbsp;the fact &nbsp;that 
&nbsp;toyota employs many americans and &nbsp; treats them better<br>
<br>
<br>

desperate people say and do , the expected..<br>
<br>
finally, before ford 
redesigned the f 150, &nbsp;it was notoriously a &nbsp;failure in crash tests, 
the &nbsp;old generation tundra might not have had the looks but it always 
scored better in crash tests. &nbsp;<br>

<p> FOR THE CAMSHAFT THAT &nbsp;WAS A &nbsp;SUPPLIER ISSUE... IT DID NOT 
&nbsp;EXTEND TO ALL TRUCKS ONLY A HANDFUL..OUT OF HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS..WHY 
DO PEOPLE JUST BLOW THAT OUT OF PROPORTION!!! ITS NOT THAT TOYOTA WOULD 
KNOWINGLY PUT IN A WEAK CAMSHAFT IN..SAME WITH OTHER THINGS.. &nbsp;IT &nbsp;IS 
HOW TOYOTA RESPONDED.. &nbsp;THAT MATTERS , THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED... 
&nbsp;THE 5.7 IS A MUCH EFFICIENT AND BETTER DESIGNED ENGINE WITH TECH &nbsp;, 
COMPARED TO &nbsp; THE DOMESTICS WHICH USE OHV DESIGNS.. &nbsp;<br>
