<p>When the new Chevy Cruze hits showroom floors in mid-2010, GM isn&rsquo;t 
just hoping it will fetch higher prices than its Japanese competitors &mdash; 
they<i>need</i> it to. GM is banking on the Cruze costing more than its 
competitors so the company can make up some of the revenue lost when the market 
abandoned trucks and SUVs in favor of small cars.Chevrolet General Manager Ed 
Peper told the Detroit News that GM needs to get more for the Cruze than its 
prime competitors,Honda and Toyota, are getting for their cars in the same 
segment.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Value and price are offshoots of what consumers think about them, 
what they&rsquo;re willing to pay for the products,&rdquo; said Peper. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously in our best interest if people think more of our 
products, the more the value that we provide.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> While the Cobalt, the Cruze predecessor, is currently fetching 
substantially less that its competitors, the Malibu is going for $4,200 more 
than the previous model and has been a big hit for GM. The company is obviously 
hoping that the Cruze can repeat that success. GM has not yet announced 
pricing, but it&rsquo;s expected to be substantially higher than the average 
$16,455 Cobalts are going for right now. The Cruze will be larger than the 
Cobalt, the Toyota Corolla, the Honda Civic and the Ford Focus, but GM says 
that it will get better gas mileage than all of its competitors, about 40 mpg 
out of the 1.4L four-cylinder Family Zero engine.</p> 
<p> The Cruze is expected to be higher quality and better styled than the 
out-going Cobalt and should get much better fuel mileage. However, GM still 
trying to shake the image that it makes less valuable cars than the 
competition, and while the Malibu has been a big success, it&rsquo;s no 
guarantee that the Cruze will be as well. We&rsquo;ll be waiting to see if GM 
can pull of another big winner that can not only pull down a higher price than 
the competition, but sell in the volume necessary to make it another hit for GM.
We&rsquo;ll be seeing the Cruze at the Paris Motor Show next month, so keep 
checking in at Motor Trend.com for all the latest on Chevy&rsquo;s new small 
car. In the meantime, let us know how much you think GM can get away with 
selling the Cruze for below. Can a Chevy command a higher price than a 
comparable Japanese car and still sell, or will the brand be relegated to the 
bargain table for the forseeable future?</p>

<p>Dropping the cobalt and filling its spot with the Aveo thus making a hole 
for the Cruze. The Cruze must be a success. Im not sure how many more complete 
failures GM can handle with the ever changing market. :confused:</p> <br>

<p>Wow I didn&rsquo;t know that&hellip;.why would a young person want to buy a 
Focus? It&rsquo;s hidious, uninspiring, SLOW and did I mention it&rsquo;s 
ugly&hellip;..but then again so are 99% of Asian compact cars (Civic, Corolla 
etc.)If the Cruze is the little brother to the new Malibu (meaning style, fit, 
finish etc.) it will definitely be a winner, especially with the 1.4 liter 
turbo (40 mpg). </p> <br>

<p>If the 1.4 turbo has more power than the Civic Si, and they lose that ugly 
sheetmetal and replace it with the Volt styling, then they can charge more. 
Otherwise it is a stupid idea.</p> <br>

<p>I think they&rsquo;d have more success if they keep the price about even 
with its competitors. Once consumers see they can get a lot more for the same 
price, more would go for the Cruze. Going this route though means you&rsquo;re 
getting more with the Cruze &ndash; but you&rsquo;re also paying more. This 
makes it resemble a fully loaded competitor instead of a good value, meaning 
Chevy would lose people interested in a more stripped, lower priced base model.

<p>They can charge more if the car is better. They should go right after the 
people who are moving up and out of the Scion brand. Alot of Civic,(CVCC, 
remember that?), and Corolla buyers are older people. Younger folk seem to 
prefer the Mazda3 and surprising Focus.</p> <br>

<p>That depends on what the Cruze brings to the table and as long as drivers 
don&rsquo;t see it as bargain basement Chevy (aka Cavalier). The Cobalt was a 
decent enough try but the Cruze has to be better than not just the current crop 
of Civics and Corollas out there, but better than their next generation 
iterations. If GM pulls it off then I&rsquo;m pretty sure thet can make money 
on this car.</p> <br>

<p>I agree w/ 21budd..I&rsquo;d need to see one, sit in one and drive one. 
From what I can tell though it looks promising. People might scratch their 
heads at first but if GM markets this right and word gets out about not only 
its performance but improved quality then I think it&rsquo;ll eventually fetch 
more money. I would be willing to pay more for something that&rsquo;s an 
improvement over the Civic/Corolla duo.</p> <br>

<p>Sweet. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a larger Cobalt that is even more expensive. 
The Aveo is looking better and better each redesign and it is practically the 
same size as the Cobalt. So they can update the engine for better economy, give 
it more options and that car is good to go. They also have the HHR, Astra, Vibe 
and might even keep the G6 for a while.</p> <br>

<p>Well Coya, The cruze isn&rsquo;t a hybrid at all, thats the volt.I can 
understand your confusion with all of the great new things gm is coming out 
with right now. But i would pay 1k more is it was a bigger better, more 
efficient car than a civic.</p> <br>
</li> 
<li> Bryanski Posted on: September 16, 2008&nbsp;1:36 pm Reply <br>

<p>It all depends on where the competition is in 2010-11. What will Honda, 
Toyota, Nissan, Mazda, VW, and even Hyundai have to offer by then? I&rsquo;m 
sure they&rsquo;re going to step up their game. I know that Civics are high in 
demand, and people pay close to MSRP or even a marked up price for them, while 
most American cars sell for way under MSRP and with some sort of rebate. 
Chevy&rsquo;s going to have to have something up it&rsquo;s sleeve with this 
new car if they expect it move at a higher price than the benchmark.</p> <br>

<p>It should be VERY competative with other companies, maybe a whee bit higher 
if it has more options/power/size. to bank on a higher price and hope it works 
out, they&rsquo;re gonna have to kiss a lot of ass and even then it&rsquo;s 
doubtful to work out. due to the current hard times for the big 3, expecting 
great sales on a higher priced vehicle is not going to work out.</p> <br>

<p>If the Cruze is substantially better then the Cobalt, yes. Current US 
C-segments(Focus/Cobalt) are POS not worth more then $15K($14,500 for a 
&rsquo;09 Cobalt). If the Cruze is on par with the Japanese competition and 
gets 5mpg better, it would be worth a 10% premium($18,700) over the $17K 
Civic/Corolla. If it&rsquo;s more of the same, the Cruze would need to be 
priced below the competition.</p> <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should look at this as ambitious, arrogant, stupid, 
or all three! GM has a lot of lost ground to make up in consumer perception, 
especially with compact cars. Pricing the Cruze substantially higher than the 
competition would be a BIG mistake. I would price it right on par with a 
comparable model. Offer some premium option packages for those that really want 
to load it up, but give customers a choice.</p> <br>

<p>They can charge more if it offers more. Make it have better quality, get 
better mpg, and keep the styling advantage (The Civic is not well styled).But 
GM cannot keep the same vendors offering lower-grade interior materials. Not 
unless they price it comparably.Basically, Chevy has to cut their vehicle issue 
rate in half, or start separating from the older models that have the higher 
incident rates.</p> <br>

<p>that sounds ambitious&hellip;.if the cruze is bigger than civic/corolla, is 
good enough to command a decent price and gets 40mpg&hellip;.its going to steal 
a lot of sales from the Malibu.Which may not be a very bad thing&hellip;because 
the next gen mailbu (similar to the insignia) will be larger and more expensive 
than the current one and will encroach on impala territory&hellip;i predict 
that the impala will die a slow death&hellip;just like the crown vic&hellip;or 
(hoping!!) it will become a niche RWD zeta car.GM will keep the cobalt going 
for a couple of years, till the next gen gamma platform (aveo, corsa) gets a 
footing in the market&hellip;after that the cobalt too will disappearnow there 
will be space at the very bottom of the market&hellip;enter the chevy 
beatsounds like a plan to me</p> <br>

<p>:p The Cruz concept will not fly! Why no go 100% electric? Just give me a 
space to drop in a generator for those trips over 200 miles! That&rsquo;s what 
we want.A cool looking, inexpensive, all electric car(oil companies and the 
middle east kiss our &hellip;&rsquo;s)! If I go on a trip let me put in my own 
generator for power if needed. Why pack the extra weight with a hybrid?

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that a two drink minimum was required for GM 
decision makes.</p> <br>

<p>I guess it will depend on what you get in the Cruze. If the base model is 
relatively loaded, I suppose GM might pull it off. Civics are known for 
reliablility and good resale value. People may want to keep a little knowing 
they can get a better price for it in 4-5 years when they trade it in.</p> <br>

<p>Without seeing a real live Cruze it would be hard to say but at this time 
nobody pairs Chevy with &ldquo;premium&rdquo;. The Chevy brand for most people 
is down market product and is supposed to be less expensive than the 
competition. As far as I can tell GM did that on purpose to make their other 
brands seem more upmarket. If they want to charge more for a Chevy they are 
going to have to re-brand their whole division. They have to take their 
Wal-mart and make it more Nordstrum. How they do that I have no idea. Honda and 
Toyota have earned their good reputations with consistant qualtiy products over 
years and years.</p> <br>
