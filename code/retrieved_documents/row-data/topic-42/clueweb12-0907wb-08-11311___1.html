The Second Act of the 
Station Wagon Second Opinion Top 5 Features Data and Charts Editors' Evaluations
Final Rankings and Scoring Explanation <br>

<p>You don't choose cars like these, you succumb to them. They creep up on you 
like thin hair and thick ankles. One minute you're rolling a 3 Series coupe, 
the next minute your wife needs room to haul her gardening stuff and the kids 
want rear doors and a DVD player.</p> 
<p>It's about that time when wagon-style things like the 2010 Honda Accord 
Crosstour and 2009 Toyota Venza start to look attractive. OK, plausible maybe.
</p> 
<p>With extra cargo room and a more comforting view of the road, these tall 
wagons are sort of like SUVs, only without the guilt of a gas-sucking V8 under 
the hood. You won't find any big, heavy truck parts underneath their skins 
either.</p> 
<p>Granted, neither the Honda nor the Toyota is going to do much for your 
image. In fact, you can pretty much kiss good-bye whatever sliver of cool you 
still had left. There are no wheels tall enough nor tires wide enough to make 
either of these vehicles look tough. These are wagons, and it's what's inside 
that counts. Don't worry, though. Your friends may wince, but your family will 
love you.</p> 
<p><strong>The Station Wagon Is Back</strong><br>
 Honda and Toyota have done 
their best to position these vehicles as something entirely new, crossovers 
that defy categorization &mdash; segment-busters, if you will. But once you cut 
beneath the marketingspeak, the Crosstour and the Venza are essentiallyAccord 
andCamry wagons. </p> 
<p>There should be no shame in such vehicles, and both the 2010 Honda Accord 
Crosstour and the 2009 Toyota Venza have the mainstream persona adopted over 
the years by the Accord and Camry. When you compare them with sedans, there are 
a few notable differences like the higher ride height and optional 
all-wheel-drive systems. And for better or worse, both feature unique styling. 
Some of this is helpful. The fact that both vehicles are treated as premium 
versions of their respective sedans is slightly less so.</p> 
<p>Yes, you must pay up for the privilege of piloting these suburban 
carry-alls. The cheapest Honda Accord Crosstour starts at just under $30K for a 
front-wheel-drive model with a V6. The Venza offers a base model with an 
inline-4, but even that starts at $26K. Get loaded-up versions as we did and 
you're looking at $37,000 for the Honda and just over $39,000 for the Toyota.
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>To expect anything more than a sedate driving experience from either of 
these wagons is asking too much. They are five-passenger cocoons.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Did you think the latest in car-based family transportation was going to be 
cheaper than some primitive pickup-based SUV? No chance, but at these prices 
these crossovers do include numerous family-friendly gadgets, like navigation 
systems, high-end stereos, heated leather seats, plus the requisite back-up 
camera so you don't run over the dog.</p> 
<p><strong>Big Backyards</strong><br>
 The whole point of these vehicles is 
the extra cargo room out back, so here's what you can expect. The Toyota 
Venza's cargo bay is wide and shallow. The Crosstour's space is narrow and 
deep. In technical terms this translates to 30.7 cubic feet of room behind the 
Venza's rear seats and 25.7 cubic feet in the Crosstour.</p> 
<p>For further comparison, consider the fact that the Accord and Camry sedans 
offer roughly 14 cubic feet of space in their trunks. It's also worth noting 
that the hatchback configurations of the Crosstour and Venza make for much 
larger openings so there's less wedging and angling required in order to pack 
stuff in.</p> 
<p>In the 2010 Honda Accord Crosstour, we found that a large suitcase and a 
stroller fit a little tight, while the Venza had room to spare with the same 
load. Possibly more important is the fact that the Venza offers an optional 
power-operated hatch and the Crosstour doesn't. On the flip side, there are 
several under-floor storage bins in the Honda and none in the Toyota.</p> 
<p>If maximum capacity is a priority, the 2009 Toyota Venza wins with a total 
of 70 cubic feet of space compared to the Crosstour's 50.1 cubic feet. Both 
vehicles have 60/40-split second-row seats and both provide levers in the cargo 
area to fold them flat while you're loading up.</p> 
<p>Again, the Honda's shorter, narrower space presents more of a challenge for 
odd-shaped cargo like a mountain bike, although one will fit even if one 
section of the second-row seat is in place. In the Venza, a bike fits more 
easily and your kid won't be eating the tire while he's sitting in the second 
row.</p> 
<p><strong>Two Sides of the Same Coin </strong><br>
 Aside from their sizable 
backsides, the Crosstour and the Venza look and feel a lot like Accord and 
Camry sedans. Other than its slightly higher seating position, the Crosstour 
feels almost identical to the Accord from behind the wheel. That's probably 
because the cabin is, in fact, identical to that of the Accord sedan.</p> 
<p>This is not altogether a bad thing. It means the 2010 Honda Accord 
Crosstour has an easy-to-read instrument cluster, high-quality interior 
materials and good visibility for driving. Build quality is solid, too. Other 
than the overcrowded mess of buttons in the middle of the dashboard, the 
Crosstour is a high-quality piece for a family car.</p> 
<p>Toyota took a slightly different tack with the Venza. This Toyota crossover 
gets a unique interior layout compared to the Camry. There's a high-mounted 
shift lever on the elevated center console and a simplified climate control 
layout. It's all connected to a reconfigurable center console between the front 
seats that includes cupholders, iPod connections and extra storage room.</p> 
<p>On the whole, though, the 2009 Toyota Venza's interior often misses the 
mark. The shift lever is indeed handy and the center console useful, but the 
rest of the cabin is too low-budget given the Venza's price. The climate 
controls feel frail, the wood trim isn't convincing and the texture of the 
steering wheel cover and dashboard is oddly rough and cheap-looking.</p> 
<p>We also noticed that our particular Venza showed numerous signs of poor 
construction. Several panels on the dashboard were misaligned, while others 
appeared to be peeling back &mdash; not what you would expect from a company 
that built its reputation on quality control.</p> 
<p><strong>They Drive Like Sedans</strong><br>
 To expect anything more than a 
sedate driving experience from either of these wagons is asking too much. They 
are five-passenger cocoons. You don't really drive them; you just sort of ride 
along.</p> 
<p>That said, both vehicles have well-sorted suspensions and plenty of power. 
The Venza's V6 sends 268 horsepower through a six-speed automatic transmission, 
while the Crosstour uses five gears to distribute its 271 hp.</p> 
<p>The extra gear helps the Venza quite a bit, as it hits 60 mph from a stop 
nearly a second quicker than the Crosstour (6.9 seconds versus 7.8 seconds), 
despite weighing 73 pounds more than the Honda (4,108 pounds versus 4,035 
pounds).</p> 
<p>Our seat-of-the-pants impression suggests it's not simply the Toyota's 
gearing that makes the difference between these two crossovers, because the 
Venza's transmission also shifts more deliberately and has much quicker 
reactions during normal driving. Stomp the throttle in the Honda and the 
gearbox thinks about it first before shelling out the horsepower.</p> 
<p>It's a similar situation when it comes to handling. The 20-inch wheels and 
more aggressive Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires that come standard on the higher-trim 
Venza deliver better grip and sharper turn-in. Through the slalom they give the 
Toyota an advantage of about 1 mph over the Honda. Even during normal driving, 
the 2009 Toyota Venza feels lighter and more nimble than the 2010 Honda Accord 
Crosstour. If it weren't for the overboosted steering, the Venza might actually 
be interesting to drive instead of merely pleasant.</p> 
<p>With its smaller, less aggressive tires and softer suspension setup, the 
Crosstour rides more comfortably over rough surfaces. Its steering isn't much 
better than the Venza's, though. It always feels like it wants to spring back 
to center and there's minimal road feel. There's very little harshness either, 
though, and the cabin is generally quieter than the Venza's, so it coddles a 
bit more than the Toyota.</p> 
<p><strong>Safety First</strong><br>
 If you're going to bite the bullet and 
go all in for the family, you might as well get a vehicle that includes more 
safety and functionality than you'll ever need. The safety part is easy in this 
case, as both vehicles feature multiple airbags and electronic stability 
control systems for protection before and during an accident.</p> 
<p>Naturally, four-wheel antilock brakes are standard across the board and 
both vehicles returned similar distances in our 60-0-mph testing (129 feet for 
the Honda and 128 feet for the Toyota). Pedal feel is slightly better in the 
Venza, as the action is light and easy to modulate.</p> 
<p>Both vehicles feature optional all-wheel-drive systems, which also add a 
measure of safety in poor weather. You never really know that they're even 
along for the ride until you encounter a loss of traction at the front wheels, 
which sends power immediately to the rear wheels to help out.</p> 
<p>On rain-soaked roads we could feel the systems work only with full-throttle 
starts from a stop. Snow would obviously be a different story, but even 
front-wheel-drive versions come with standard traction control. There's a 
penalty for the added weight of the AWD system, though. The Venza's EPA mileage 
numbers drop by 1 mpg with AWD, while the Crosstour drops 2 mpg on the highway 
and 1 mpg in the city.</p> 
<p><strong>The Better of Two Good Choices</strong><br>
 The 2009 Toyota Venza 
has an advantage here when it comes to day-to-day functionality because its 
backseats are more spacious and a DVD player is optional. The Toyota's optional 
keyless ignition system is another feature that's useful, and it's not 
available in the Honda.</p> 
<p>As slick as the 2010 Honda Accord Crosstour is inside its cabin, after a 
week behind the wheel of both we gave the edge to the Venza. Yes, the Toyota's 
build quality is disappointing, but everything else about it is perfect for the 
segment. You can argue about the styling all you want, but the Venza delivers a 
better combination of passenger space, cargo capacity and feature content.</p> 
<p>It's also faster down a freeway on-ramp and slightly easier on the wallet 
at the pump. Not exactly the stuff of automotive legend, but once you take the 
plunge, you'll realize the compromise is worth it. Just ask the family riding 
with you.</p>

Final Rankings and Scoring Explanation <br>

<p><strong>Senior Road Test Editor Josh Jacquot says:</strong><br>
 It's hard 
to be passionate about mommy-mobiles like these. They aren't really cars and 
they aren't really SUVs and they aren't really minivans (which I'm not ashamed 
to admit I love). Instead, these bizarre wagons land somewhere in the lukewarm 
middle ground, which I find largely unappealing for its lack of commitment.</p> 
<p>So here's the Cliff's Notes version of what I like and why: </p> 
<p>If it's a contest of powertrain and handling, the Toyota Venza wins this 
comparison. Its powertrain is superior by virtue of actually motivating the car 
more quickly (despite a lower power rating), being more responsive and offering 
some control over its transmission via a manual shift gate. Handling, too, is 
sharper in the Venza thanks to more roll stiffness and bigger wheels and tires.
</p> 
<p>The downside to this, of course, is that the big Toyota doesn't ride as 
well as the Honda, which is as smooth and comfortable as every mommy will want. 
The Crosstour is also nicer inside than the Venza. The details are done very 
well inside the Crosstour and it shows. There's a creativity in the Honda's 
interior design and packaging that makes it more usable than the Toyota. It's 
also filled with nicer materials that are screwed together with more precision. 
But, goodness, is the thing ever ugly.</p> 
<p>Do the math on this equation and I'm utterly indifferent. Both cars meet 
their target without any egregious missteps. Both cars will serve you well. And 
both cars are passionless family haulers. If that's what you want, either one 
will work perfectly.</p> The Second Act of the Station Wagon Second Opinion Top

<p>When it comes to features, we considered convenience features a priority, 
reflecting the people moving for which these vehicles are intended. Keep in 
mind that anything that's standard on both vehicles isn't eligible. Obviously, 
options like an iPod connection and keyless ignition are worthwhile features, 
but we consider equipment like a limited-slip differential to be a little more 
essential. Each car received points based on whether our chosen features were 
standard or optional, and no points if it wasn't available at all.</p>

<p><strong>Power-operated rear hatch:</strong> This is one of those features 
that has finally trickled down from luxury vehicles. Press a button on the key 
fob and the hatch automatically opens and closes. That's pretty handy when your 
arms are full of stuff that you plan to put into the cargo area. It comes as 
part of the Premium package on the Venza, but is not available on the Crosstour.
</p> 
<p><strong>Keyless entry/ignition:</strong> Another useful feature to have 
when your arms are full. Just pull the door handle with the key in your pocket 
and it unlocks. Get in and push the button on the dash and it starts. Simple. 
It's part of the Premium package on the Venza and not available on the 
Crosstour.</p> 
<p><strong>Rear back-up camera:</strong> Mirrors are great, but a wide-angle 
view of what's behind you on the dashboard screen is even better. It comes 
standard on the Crosstour with Navigation and is part of the Premium package on 
the Venza.</p> 
<p><strong>Rear-seat DVD system:</strong> Some say these things are making 
kids unappreciative of the joys of driving. Others say that people who suggest 
such a thing don't have kids. Either way, it's a handy option if you're going 
on a long trip. It's optional on the Venza and not available on the Honda.</p> 
<p><strong>Navigation:</strong> This has become a must-have feature for any 
family vehicle and we can see why. It's comforting to know you'll always have a 
map handy when you need it, and the additional features like restaurant and 
hotel listings make it that much more useful. Naturally, it's standard on the 
Crosstour with navigation, and the Venza offers it as an option.</p> The Second

<p><strong>Personal Rating (2.5%):</strong> Purely subjective. After the test, 
each participating editor was asked to rank the vehicles in order of preference 
based on which he or she would buy if money were no object.</p> 
<p><strong>Recommended Rating (2.5%):</strong> After the test, each 
participating editor was asked to rank the vehicles in order of preference 
based on which he or she thought would be best for the<i>average consumer 
shopping in this segment</i>.</p> 
<p><strong>28-Point Evaluation (20%):</strong> Each participating editor 
ranked each vehicle based on a comprehensive 28-point evaluation. The 
evaluation covered everything from exterior design to cupholders. Scoring was 
calculated on a point system, and the scores listed are averages based on all 
test participants' evaluations.</p> 
<p><strong>Feature Content (20%):</strong> For this category, the editors 
picked the top five features they thought would be most beneficial to the 
consumer shopping in this segment. For each vehicle, the score was based on the 
number of actual features it had versus the total possible. Standard and 
optional equipment were taken into consideration.</p> 
<p><strong>Performance Testing (20%):</strong> Both cars were put through a 
comprehensive battery of instrumented tests, including 0-60-mph acceleration, 
quarter-mile runs and panic stops from 60 mph. They were also run through a 
600-foot slalom course to test transitional handling, and around a skid pad to 
determine ultimate grip. Each car was awarded points based on how close it came 
to the better-performing car's score in each category.</p> 
<p><strong>Fuel Consumption (15%):</strong> The scores listed are the result 
of a simple percentage calculation based on the car with the highestEPA 
combined fuel economy rating. The Toyota had a slight edge in this regard 
thanks to ratings of 18 city and 25 highway versus the Honda's ratings of 17 
city and 25 highway.</p> 
<p><strong>Price (20%):</strong> The numbers listed were the result of a 
simple percentage calculation based on the less-expensive vehicle in the 
comparison test. Using the &quot;as tested&quot; prices of the actual 
evaluation vehicles, the less expensive vehicle received a score of 100, with 
the remaining vehicle receiving a lesser score based on how much each one costs.

Again, I don't know why you are not able to comprehend what 
I am saying. The 3 Series, C Class, and ES are in the same class BECAUSE they 
are ALL entry level luxury vehicles that are in the same price range. The 3 
Series and C Class are BMW and Mercedes' ONLY offering in the entry level 
luxury sedan segment. Yes the average 3 Series driver is younger, but you would 
be ignorant to think older&nbsp;&nbsp;people never drive the 3 Series. The 
median age of C Class drivers are MUCH closer to the ES. Just because 
automotive mags don't consider these cars as competitors, doesn't mean 
consumers won't. Automotive mags (usually) prioritize performance. 99.9% of 
people don't take their cars on a racetrack so for their driving purposes the 
ES, C Class, and 3 Series are ALL the same class of cars.<br>
<br>
I challenge 
you to find anyone that would prefer the LaCrosse to the A6. I gaurantee you NO 
ONE would prefer the Buick. CLEARLY the A6 is a better car. But hey when you 
only look at features and value the LaCrosse looks pretty good. That is exactly 
what Edmunds did with the ES vs LaCrosse comparo. So what are we to conclude? 
In the same comparison the A6 would have also lost to the LaCrosse.<br>
<br>

Why should you care about Toyota's reputation for reliabilty in 1975? Why 
should you care about any automaker's reputation for reliability in 1975? Two 
words: BRAND PERCEPTION. Now it's more important than ever. Notice that almost 
every single Chevy ad takes a knock at Toyota or Honda. Toyota and Honda don't 
need to attack Chevy because consumers know they have been making quality cars 
for almost half a century, which includes 1975. FYI EVERY long term study from 
CR or JD Power still favors Japanese brands.<br>
<br>
Some other food for 
thought: If all the domestic automakers were not being brought to their knees 
due to the financial meltdown, would they still focus on quality? Look how fast 
they are able to turn around. They could have done this a decade or two ago. 
Why didn't they? Because they were still making a profit. It's sad to think the 
ONLY reason a company finally decides to build quality products is because it 
was either that or go belly up. What happens when they regain consumer 
confidence? Will they start cutting corners again to maximize profits?<br>
<br>

So the Euro Focus and other Euro cars are finally able to come to America 
because Ford and GM somehow was recently able to figure out how to even out 
costs? No. Allow me to educate you. There is no miracle formula to cut costs 
while maintaining quality. Fact is all the domestics could have done this YEARS 
ago, but they didn't. Why? Because they know they could make a HIGHER profit 
buy selling inferior products here. For years they got away with it until 
consumers were finally fed up. Ford will not make as much profit selling the 
new Focus as they are making now with the current one. They knew they had 
better products overseas. Competition from the imports were so fierce here that 
Ford and GM were FORCED to bring those cars here. Remember they are not 
improving because they want to, they are improving because they are FORCED to.
<br><br>
If we never experienced an economic meltdown... if Ford, GM, and 
Chrysler were still making profits, they wouldn't give a crap about 
reliability. We'd still see the same shoddy cars they have been making for 
years. So I ask again... What happens when they start to make a profit and 
regain consumer confidence? What then?<br>

You are incredibly naive. I know how 99% of cars are 
driven&nbsp;&nbsp;but that doesn't stop people from buying 300hp cars, sports 
cars, V8s, etc. for commuting purposes a corolla or Sentra will do just fine. 
BAsed on how cars are driven there is no reason for anyone to really own a BMW 
in the first place. The fact of the matter is people buy cars based on 
reputation, styling and what they can POTENTIALLY do. I never argued that BMW 
owners regularly take advantage of the handling and hp of their cars. In heavy 
urban traffic this isn't realistic. That said the 3 series conveys a younger, 
hipper image than the ES350 and appeals to a different set of buyers. As I 
said, MOST Es350 buyers are older- this isn't debatable. Everyone except you 
knows this. The 3 series is a very popular car for young singles and couples- 
its size, styling and reputatoin attracts a different type of buyer. BMW 
doesn't consider the ES350 a competitor for the 3 series, customers don't, the 
press doesn't- only you seem to think the two cars go head to head. It is 
OBVIOUS that the Lacrosse and ES350 are going after the same types of 
customers. It's also obvious that the Lacrosse is NOT aimed at the 3 series in 
any way. This is likely why the ES350 has been mentioned in Lacrosse ads and 
the 3 series has NOT.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Audi has less interior space, less 
features, and cost MUCH more than the LaCrosse so I guess Edmunds would have 
preferred the LaCrosse as well?&quot;<br>
<br>
Its possible but the two cars 
are so far apart in price that its hard to see them as direct competitors. can 
the LAcrosse do what the A6 does for less money and with more space? Yes.<br>

<br>&quot;Toyota and Honda have been consistantly producing quality long 
lasting cars for the past three or four DECADES. It's going to take a lot more 
than a few good Fords, Chevys, and Chryslers to undo consumer preception. &quot;
<br><br>
And who cares? Why do I care about quality of Toyota in 1975? Wasn't 
even born then. Don't care and its not relevant. Import fanboys cant get out of 
the past. Are you still wearning bell bottoms and listening to 8 tracks as 
well? The 70s are a long time ago. The 80s are a long time ago. If this was 
1985 I might buy a Toyota- but sadly for Toyota its 2010 and the quality issue 
is a non-issue. The quality of cars in the 80s or even 90s is irrelevant to 
today's buyers and your thinking is shared by Toyota which explains why they 
are about to face tough times going forward. Like you, Toyota doesn't 
understand that is has to compete for buyers who may not be enamored with the 
company's reputation built over the last 40 years. Why would a 25 year old 
buyer be drawn to a Toyota showroom when he is too young to even remember the 
days when Toyota quality was head and shoulders above the competition? WHy 
would he care? When the new Focus comes out I can guarantee you any gen Y buyer 
who hasnt been brainwashed by their import driving parents wont consider a 
Corolla over the Ford for a second. The corolla is going to be severely 
outclassed in every way and the only people who will be denying it will be 
Toyota loving die hards who are still basking in Toyota's past glory. Mediocre 
cars are good enough for people like you who are still living in the past- but 
they arent good enough to convince open minded customers to buy Toyota.<br>
<br>
A &quot;few&quot; domestic cars are good? Have you looked at CR or JD POwer 
lately? Its a lot more than a few. CR claims nearly EVERy Ford product is above 
average in reliability. Give credit where it's due. If you can.<br>
<br>

&quot;Why did it take them so long to improve quality? &quot;<br>
<br>
Who 
cares. People are buying cars TODAY so what is relevant is what's on sale 
TODAY. Not 20 years ago. 20 years ago most cars were undesirable by today's 
standards.<br>
<br>
&quot;They were given a choice: make quality cars or be 
destroyed by the imports.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed. What's your point? <br>
<br>

&quot;Some food for thought: Until recently Ford and GM had some great cars 
that were only sold in Europe and Asia. Ford and Chevy were offering BETTER 
cars in Europe than they were in their home market, the US. Why? Why was our 
Focus so awful? Why do we get the Fusion while they get the Mondeo? &quot;<br>

<br>Costs. Its that simple. Until recently Ford and GM didnt have the cost 
structures here that would allow them to sell higher content overseas based 
vehicles here for resonable prices. That has changed and they also believe 
Americans will pay more for excellent small cars. What does any of this have to 
do with reliability? The bottom line is their best global vehicles will be 
available here and that is bad&nbsp;&nbsp;news for Toyota and HOnda.<br>
<br>

&quot;The G8 even had a large LCD screen perfect for GPS. Ooooh thats right GM 
wants you to use OnStar instead.&quot;<br>
<br>
The G8 wasnt intended as a US 
car from the start and something about the positioning of the nav screen 
supposedly didn't meet US standards. That is what I read. Again- how is this 
relevant?<br>
<br>
&quot;They could've brought those models to the US YEARS 
ago, GM and Ford have only been trickling in those cars recently. &quot;<br>

<br>Countour was a MOndeo and it failed. Catera was an Opel- didn't do well. 
GTO was a Holden- didn't do well even though it was an excellent car. GM and 
Ford have sold overseas models here in the past but for the most part things 
have not worked out. European cars like the Focus sell for far more than their 
US counterparts and Ford had to find a way to get the costs close to what US 
customers are willing to pay. in EUrope they will pay $30k for a compact- not 
here. Believe me, the US Corolla and Civic wouldnt cut it in Europe which is 
one reason why Toyota/Honda arent all that successful over there.<br>

<p>I have to agree with Edmunds comments on Venza interior. I was really 
interested in the Venza as it drove nice and was fairly quick, but I just could 
not get over the dashboard plastic and leather seating material. Dashboard 
texture really does look cheap and leather seating looked cheap to me too.<br>

<br>Ended up buying a Murano LE whose interior was vastly improved in 2009. Not 
up to the standards of the loaded 2007 MB ML320 I'm getting out of, but much 
better than the Venza. Otherwise Venza is real decent car.</p> Report ItReport

How are you able to not comprehend what I am saying? 
Seriously this must be the third or fourth time I am saying this. The AVERAGE 
consumer (non automotive enthusiast) will see the C Class, 3 Series, and ES as 
being the same class of cars. Why? Because they are ALL entry level luxury 
sedans that are in the same price range. Automotive mags will not compare these 
cars because they prioritize performance. 99.9% of ALL C Classes and 3 Series' 
will be driven the exact same way the ES is driven: in straight lines on long 
highways. For the .01 % of people who take their C Class and 3 Series on a 
racetrack on a regular basis they should've spent their $40k on an Evo or STI.
<br><br>
The C Class and 3 Series would have lost to the LaCrosse because the 
comparison of the ES favored features and price, not performance. Both the C 
Class and 3 Series are smaller, has less features, and cost more than the 
LaCrosse. They would have lost to the Buick as well.<br>
<br>
According to your 
flawed logic the FWD Audi A6 would also be in the same class as the ES and 
LaCrosse. Hey all are large FWD sedans right? The Audi has less interior space, 
less features, and cost MUCH more than the LaCrosse so I guess Edmunds would 
have preferred the LaCrosse as well?<br>
<br>
As far as quality improvement 
among domestic brands, yes they have greatly improved over the past two or 
three years. But thats all. Toyota and Honda have been consistantly producing 
quality long lasting cars for the past three or four DECADES. It's going to 
take a lot more than a few good Fords, Chevys, and Chryslers to undo consumer 
preception. Why did it take them so long to improve quality? Because now they 
realize it was sink or swim. What if they never went through a financial 
breakdown? What if they were still able to make a profit by cranking out shoddy 
cars and not improving quality? You would be ignorant to think domesetics 
improved quality just for the heck of it. The domestics didn't start making 
quality cars because they wanted to, they did it because they were forced to. 
They were given a choice: make quality cars or be destroyed by the imports.<br>

<br>Fast forward ten or twenty years in the future. Detroit comes out with some 
great reliable cars, they regain consumer confidence in their brands. What 
then? Will they continue making quality cars? Or will they go back to making 
shoddy but stylish cars? No one knows the answer, not even you.<br>
<br>
Some 
food for thought: Until recently Ford and GM had some great cars that were only 
sold in Europe and Asia. Ford and Chevy were offering BETTER cars in Europe 
than they were in their home market, the US. Why? Why was our Focus so awful? 
Why do we get the Fusion while they get the Mondeo? Look at China's version of 
the Buick Regal. It came out around 2005 and was based on the Holden Commadore. 
Why didn't Buick America get the same Regal? When the US finally got a version 
of the Commadore, it came as the Pontiac G8. Awesome car, but why could GM not 
offer GPS Navigation when EVERY other car in the same class offers GPS. The G8 
even had a large LCD screen perfect for GPS. Ooooh thats right GM wants you to 
use OnStar instead.<br>
<br>
They could've brought those models to the US YEARS 
ago, GM and Ford have only been trickling in those cars recently. We're still 
waiting on the Fiesta and new Focus. Guess they finally woke up and found out 
Americans want American car companies to sell good cars here too.<br>

<p>&quot;Wow so according to you EVERY ES owner is in their 60's and EVERY 3 
Series owner is in their 40's? You really must be dense or don't get out 
enough. How many times do I have to say this? To the average consumer (non 
automotive enthusiast), the 3 Series, C Class, ES, and even the IS are the same 
class of cars.&quot;<br>
<br>
They are not and the reasons are obvious. Which 
is why no one else has supported you here. The ES is larger, FWD, softer, 
offers no manual transmission, etc. Its not aimed at the 3 series and it never 
has been. I didn't say EVERY ES owner is over 60 but we all know the car is 
aimed at an older demographic. Please show me ONE comparison done by any car 
magazine or site that compared the ES with the RWD cars you mentioned. Just 
one. Most 3 series owners wouldnt be caught dead in an ES350.<br>
<br>
&quot;So 
I say this again, looking at how skewed the comparison between the ES and 
LaCrosse was, the C Class and 3 Series would have lost to the Buick as 
well.&quot;<br>
<br>
The fact that the ES lost doesnt make the test 
&quot;skewed&quot;. You keep dancing around the reasons why it lost. Yes it was 
slightly faster but the ES was also more expensive, more poorly equipped, 
uglier, smaller and older. That is why it lost. Based on what the average 
LAcrosse or ES owner is looking for the 3 series would indeed lose in a 
comparison. If you are buying a Lacrosse you are looking for FWD and a spacious 
interior- the 3 series offers neither.<br>
<br>
&quot;You say they don't have 
anything but their reputaion for building reliable cars like it's meaningless. 
Guess what? Thats the exact kind of thinking that got Detroit in trouble in the 
first place. They thought they could get away with building shoddy cars as long 
as they were stylish and flashy. Over time they were proven dead wrong. Why did 
it take them this long to realize their mistake? Why didn't they fix their 
quality issues in the 80's and 90's?&quot;<br>
<br>
Your ignorance about the 
auto industry is apparent. You are spewing out typical Toyota fanboy talking 
points- I've heard them all a million times. First of all Detroit never said 
quality wasn't important- they just didnt know how to get quality built in for 
years because they had to dissect every aspect of Toyota/Honda's engineering 
and production systems and figure out how to implement them. financial 
meltdowns, unions, in-fighting, inadequate leadership, etc. meant that it took 
years to implement the engineering and produciton methods necessary to improve 
quality. It took longer than it should have but that's irrelevant now- its been 
done. Stylish and flashy? WHat 80s cars are you talking about? This idea that 
they tried to distract people with flashy cars in the 80s in nonsense- most 
cars in the 80s were dull including the American ones. The 80s is actually when 
many of the changes were being implemented to catch up to the Japanese. 
Reliability isnt meaningless, but its not the only reason to buy a car. At 
least for people who buy anything other than Toyota. Now that reliability is 
solid across the board its going to take more than claims about reliability to 
remain relevant. Ford and hyundai gained share in 2009 and neither has the 
reputation of Toyota or Honda. Value, features, styling, warranty protection 
and innovation are important these days and you don't see Toyota or Honda 
leading in any of those categories aside from Toyota's hybrids. Within the next 
5 years VW, Hyundai, GM and Ford will be coming on strong and their gains will 
be at the expense of Toyota and Honda. You can see how the battle is shaping up 
based on future product. Honda has little to talk about, Toyota is promising 
more dull hybrids and little else and GM, Ford, Hyundai and VW are preparing 
full fledged product assaults primarily in the segments long dominated by the 
Japanese.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

EVERY 3 Series owner is in their 40's? You really must be dense or don't get 
out enough. How many times do I have to say this? To the average consumer (non 
automotive enthusiast), the 3 Series, C Class, ES, and even the IS are the same 
class of cars. They are ALL entry level luxury sedans that are in the same 
price range. The average consumer won't notice the difference between a FWD car 
and a RWD car. Why? Because 99.9% of all C Classes and 3 Series will be driven 
the exact same way any ordinary ES would be driven, that is in straight lines 
on long highways. For that .01% who take their C Class and 3 Series on a 
racetrack on a regular basis, they probably would have been more satisfied 
spending their $40k on an Evo or STI. So I say this again, looking at how 
skewed the comparison between the ES and LaCrosse was, the C Class and 3 Series 
would have lost to the Buick as well. Sure they perform better, but it's not as 
spacious, cost more, and had less features than the LaCrosse. It's exactly why 
the ES lost.<br>
<br>
Just for fun, lets forget about the C Class and 3 Series. 
Lets say they compared the LaCrosse to a FWD Audi A6. Hey it's also a large FWD 
luxury sedan right? Sure the A6 will outperform the LaCrosse in EVERY way. But 
it cost a lot more than both the LaCrosse and the ES, has less interior space, 
and has less features. So I guess Edmunds would prefer the LaCrosse over the A6 
as well?<br>
<br>
In response to your response to AJT, it's going to take a lot 
more than a dozen or so decent domestic cars to undo Toyota and Honda's 
reputation for building quality vehicles over that past thirty or forty years. 
You say they don't have anything but their reputaion for building reliable cars 
like it's meaningless. Guess what? Thats the exact kind of thinking that got 
Detroit in trouble in the first place. They thought they could get away with 
building shoddy cars as long as they were stylish and flashy. Over time they 
were proven dead wrong. Why did it take them this long to realize their 
mistake? Why didn't they fix their quality issues in the 80's and 90's? Because 
they thought they could still make a profit. Over time the consumers spoke, and 
the only reason why they are changing now is because they realize that if they 
don't they will be oblitorated by the imports. So now I wonder what will happen 
when the domestics regain the consumer's confidence? Will they continue to 
design vehicles with quality as a top priority? Or will they cut back on 
quality to maximize profits? ... And like I said before no one knows the 
answer, not even you.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

Suppose I either a) dont care about keeping a car for 15 
years/200k miles or b) believe that most cars can go the distance due to the 
general high quality of vehicles today. With that assumption in hand explain to 
me why I should be a devoted Toyota or Honda purchaser that generally refuses 
to acknowledge or even research the competition.<br>
<br>
Toyota and Honda have 
realized they dont have anything left beyond their reputations and that is why 
they are now engineering by marketing. Both companies ads have drifted from 
talking about vehicles and attributes to unsubstantiated claims about quality 
and reliability and claims about how many 20 year old cars are on the road. 
Quality is great but everyone offers it today. Which is one reason why GM, Ford 
and Hyundai arent afraid to offer better warranty protection than Honda or 
Toyota.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>1st Place: 2009 Toyota Venza</p> With all the room, power and convenience 
features you'll ever need, the Toyota Venza defines the crossover wagon.
<p>2nd Place: 2010 Honda Accord Crosstour</p> Exquisitely engineered and 
solidly built, the Honda Accord Crosstour's slightly smaller size and fewer 
features leave it one small step behind the Venza.

Test Driver Ratings &amp; Comments <br>
Acceleration comments 
Impressive out-of-the-hole stomp. Spins the tires and then hooks up and hauls 
the mail. Likes a little brake torque off the line. Manual shifting doesn't 
improve the times at all. <br>
Braking rating Average <br>
Braking comments 
Consistent pedal during this test and when slowing down during accel runs. Best 
distance on last stop. <br>
Handling rating Average <br>
Handling comments 
(Skid pad) Reasonable body control and confident grip, but highly managed by 
the electronics, which keeps limits artificially low. Moderate understeer, not 
responsive to lift throttle. (Slalom) Far more capability in the chassis, but 
stability control system makes it hard to pull a good number. ESC is never 
completely off, but it does allow some additional leeway with it off. Goes 
where you point it, but only after heavy intervention and slowing. <br>

Test Driver Ratings &amp; Comments
<br> Acceleration comments Feels soft, slower than Venza when it comes to 
throttle response and tranny response. Overall powertrain is less impressive 
than Venza. <br>
Braking rating Average <br>
Braking comments No fade at the 
pedal until slowing down from acceleration runs. However, each run was 
progressively longer. As with most Hondas, the Crosstour's setup could use more 
thermal capacity. <br>
Handling rating Average <br>
Handling comments (Skid 
pad) Excessive understeer and body roll. Doesn't like midcorner bumps. Could 
use more damping, blah steering feel. (Slalom) Body roll makes transitions a 
real adventure and increases stability control intervention. Off does mean off 
with the stability control, though. Even so, soft chassis and hard tires make 
it a handful compared to the Venza. <br>
