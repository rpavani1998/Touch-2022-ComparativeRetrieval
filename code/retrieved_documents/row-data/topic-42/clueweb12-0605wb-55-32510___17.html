<h1>What car should I buy for a family of six?</h1>  TerraPass | March 31, 2009
<h2>Big families need big cars &mdash; are there any affordable, 
fuel-efficiency options?</h2>  &nbsp; 
<p><em>This week&rsquo;s question comes from one of our own staff. If you have 
suggestions, please leave them in the comments below.</em></p> 
<p>Its time! My Ford Windstar has over 100,000 miles, the automatic doors do 
not work anymore, and it cost me a new transmission about three years ago. I 
never miss an oil change and believe cars should not be disposable items to be 
replaced every few years, but the time has come to &ldquo;pimp a new 
ride.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Here is the equation:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Must fit six comfortably. (This means some crossovers are off the list; a 
six-year-old with his knees in his chest is not comfortable.)</li> 
<li>Affordable</li> 
<li>Fuel efficient</li> 
<li>And, yes, I would prefer to help our economy and buy American, if possible
</li> </ul> 
<p>Can all these factors = my new family car?</p> 
<p>After extensive research, I am leaning towards the Honda Pilot, for 
reliability mostly. But I&rsquo;m having trouble with it not being American, 
although I can be convinced because it is put together in the U.S. I am looking 
for feedback, especially if you own a car that fits this description.</p> <br>

<p>Have you looked into the large crossovers from GM? Saturn Outlook is my 
favorite with GMC Acadia a very close second. I'm sure you could buy them for 
basically the same price as the Pilot, feature for feature. You mentioned 
reliability, I have an 03 Pontiac Gran Prix with 115,000 miles on it and have 
had no problems with it - none. And it has a great, responsive engine. I've 
driven the Outlook and it too has a strong engine. Good luck.</p> <br>

<p>I have a Ford Freestyle (now Taurus X) and I like it a lot. The third row 
is a little snug for a big adult, but kids and teens fit back there. Plus it's 
on the small side for a car that big, but that makes it easier to drive and 
park and allows for better gas mileage. I get around 20 city driving, and in 
the summer I get 30+ on the highway.</p> <br>

<p>Try a Mazda5 on for size. Fits six, gets about 20/28 mpg city/hwy, and 
rings up at less than $20,000. Eager 4 cylinder engine provides a nice drive. I 
know Mazda is not American, but Ford owns about 33% of Mazda, so it's like the 
next best thing.<br>
 For something larger, you should consider a Ford Flex. I 
don't care for the looks, but it seems to fit the rest of your equation, and it 
gets about the same mileage as the Pilot.<br>
 Hey, even if you buy the Pilot, 
you're making a good choice.</p> <br>

<p>I would 2nd the Flex. They are expansive inside, which should allow your 
family room to grow-up. Since I'm guessing your 6 year old will probably be 12 
and still riding in the third row, since you wisely hold on to your cars.</p> 
<p>Initial quality looks good, and Ford quality on the whole has been on par 
with Honda and Toyota in recent years according to Consumer Reports.</p> 
<p>MPG isn't amazing, but it is on the better end of the class, skip the AWD 
and drive responsibly and you'll do pretty good.</p> <br>

<p>Try the Chrysler Pacifica. It seats 6 (the middle row has nice spacious 
captains chairs and I have spent time in the third row (I am 5'7&quot; and not 
petite.) It has a nice smooth ride and gets the same gas mileage as the much 
smaller sedan I traded in when I bought it. I have an older model (2004), but 
the newer ones have tons of great features.</p> <br>

<p>First off, let me preface this by saying that I do not blame the author for 
all of our world's problems. I also have a lot of respect for you for TRYING to 
be greener. In MY opinion however (and this does not mean I am right at all) I 
think the idea of having four children in 2009 is completely and totally 
irresponsible ecologically. Here is a case where you and your family now need 
something much larger than the average one. With that said, your best bet is a 
minivan. I don't think you want to hear that as it sounds to me like you want 
something more butch, but since you already drive one you can see that it fits 
your family better than anything else.</p> 
<p>I find it impossible that you could be getting above 30 miles per gallon in 
a Taurus X, a 4600 pound four wheel drive vehicle. If that is true, you have 
found the holy grail in vehicles.</p> 
<p>If you want fuel economy buy a 4 cylinder, don't take the temptation to get 
a more powerful 6 which uses more fuel. A four cylinder will have a little less 
power, but probably more than your old Freestar.</p> 
<p>Take a look at the following:<br>
 Chrysler/Dodge minivans (they are made 
by Chrysler so they will fall apart in a week, but they are domestic)<br>
 Ford 
and GM no longer make a minivan so your other choices are only foreign.<br>
 
Mazda 5 (small and fuel efficient mini-minivan)<br>
 Honda Odyssey (the best of 
the minivans)<br>
 The Taurus X and Chevy Uplander are possibilities too, but 
they are not as roomy as a minivan and will not get as good mileage.</p> <br>

<p>We are about to be a four-child family who needs a bigger car. Only one of 
our children is biological, while the other three are adopted. I know several 
families of very large size with NO biological children--does that offend you 
also?</p> <br>

<p>In re the mileage on a Ford Freestyle--drove it from Southern Ohio to 
northern Michigan last summer and tracked the mileage--1600 miles rt at 32 mpg. 
Not saying you could replicate that in all terrains, but I was impressed.</p>

<p>We have two girls, wanted a boy, then my wife got pregnant with twin girls.
</p> 
<p>Sorry for the environment, but honestly, we're all doomed. Read the latest 
book from Lovelock, the only independent scientific in North America: we have 
triggered something irreversible and 7/8 of Earth's population will not survive 
within 100 years because of unbearable heat. His thesis is that this would have 
happened anyways, we only accelerated it with our immense stupidity.</p> 
<p>Some will call this apocalyptic, but Ren&eacute; Dumont and some of the 
first environmentalists in the early 50's already warned us about this. I had 
children because it'll be merrier to die surrounded with a big family than 
alone...</p> 
<p>The good news with Lovelock's book is that you can buy a Hummer if you'd 
like - it's too late for the environment. Very sad but true. Don't even hope, 
enjoy life instead.</p> <br>

<p>4kids:</p> 
<p>Lovelock might be right, but I think we still understand the interactions 
of the biosphere too poorly to say for sure that he is and acting as if he's 
right--that is, resigning ourselves to catastrophe and living as if what we do 
won't matter--makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy. I prefer to think that our 
actions can make a positive difference, though it's already too late to have a 
clean and painless transition because people are already suffering and dying.

<p>how rude, I have four kids as well. They were not all planned either. God 
has a plan for all of us. Now we need a bigger car. I wanted to know this same 
question that is why I am on this website. Why are you? I actually have a ford 
explorer with a third row seat. It saves more gas than my old suburban.I am 
young and personally hate minivans. There is no reason why they can't make more 
vehicles with larger capacities. Also carpooling is better for enviroment. We 
used to take my husbands mom and sisters with us to the lake or beach. Suburban 
was good. explorer ok, not enough trunk space.</p> <br>

<p>The other posts have covered most of the cars that could work. I'd 2nd 
(3rd?) the Taurus X/Ford Freestyle. They're almost cancelled, so they should be 
dirt cheap (the Flex is replacing it). For an American car, another, smallish 
option is the Dodge Journey. Chrysler is about out of biz, but if that doesn't 
worry you, it has a lifetime warranty and should be cheap as a used sofa. The 
Mazda 5 is a GREAT little van. I've rented it and considered selling either our 
newish Saab wagon or our BMW wagon for it. It's that good. If you get a Ford 
Freestyle used, it really is good for about 30 hwy, if you live in a flat 
region. I had a rental Freestyle for a month in Florida (flat) and loved it. 
Between the CVT transmission and good aerodynamics, it got impressive mpg. 
Last, you might consider the tiny Kia Rondo. Probably too small and Korean is 
probably the soup-to-nuts opposite of American, but it is well regarded in the 
reviews I've read of it.</p> <br>

<p>We purchased a Mazda five for the occasions when we want grandparents in 
the car with children. It successfully fits six people and we have been getting 
27 MPG in mixed city and mountain driving (we rarely use this vehicle on long 
trips).</p> 
<p>We really like the car. The new model fixed the complaints we have with the 
2006 model.</p> 
<p>That said, with six full time passengers you should think about the Toyota 
Siena. It is assembled in Indiana. It has high build quality, and will be the 
most comfortable way to move your family -- so much more practical than many of 
the SUVs and pseudo SUVs people choose to move people in.</p> <br>

<p>US auto companies export a lot of the assembly to Canada, and Foreign cars 
are assembled here. And as much as I love this country, I'm sad to report that 
our unions are stronger than our vehicles. Thus, you pay almost the same price 
for a domestic vehicle that is less reliable and not nearly as well built. This 
is why the auto industry is in shambles.</p> <br>

<p>Nice try, but sorry - the facts don't support it. The major labor cost of 
U.S.-produced vehicles comes from our exorbitant health care costs, not union 
wages - and even these health care costs only add up to $1000 or so per 
vehicle. Yes, it's a lot, but it's not enough to explain the demise of the Big 
3. That story has a lot more to do with their refusal to shift production away 
from profitable-but-obsolete fuel-guzzling SUVs to more efficient and reliable 
21st-century cars that consumers want.</p> <br>

<p>I recently purchased an early 1980s model Buick Century Limimted, with 
12,000 original miles, that fits the bill for our family of six, which includes 
four teenage boys (twins in the middle). I paid $3400 cash, so I have no 
payments, and by purchasing a used car I'm not increasing the demand on new 
production, with all of the environmental concern that brings. My car is not as 
spacious as a mini-van but still seats six comfortably and gets 30+ mpg 
highway/mid-20's in town (actual usage, not estimates).</p> 
<p>BTW, the person who made the rude comment about having fewer children 
should take some sensitivity training. If there's anything to be shocked about 
in 2009, it's intolerance.</p> <br>

<p>I agree with the person who suggested the Toyota Siena. We owned one for 9 
years, 156,000 miles. Never a problem and very comfortable. Usually got 20-22 
mpg, hopefully the new ones get a little better mileage. We traded it in for a 
new Ford Escape Hybrid which is fine for our family of four but miss the 
versatility of seating grandparents and additional kids.</p> <br>

<p>I am suprised that you need a new car at 100,000 miles. Cars these days 
seem to be just hitting their stride at 100,000. I have a taurus with 120,000 
and it seems like new. gets 28 mpg and seats 7.</p> <br>

<p>I've been a Honda Odyssey owner for 14 years, since they first came out 
with the minivan. I kept the first one for 10 years and am on year 4 of the 
newly designed Odyssey. They are incredibly reliable, and the newer Odyssey 
(2005 Ex) has an interesting feature that makes it relatively fuel efficient 
for its size (4500 lbs) and 6 cylinders. Whenever it reaches cruising speed in 
a gear, or when you break or lift off the gas, it disengages 3 of the six 
cylinders and you can easily train your foot to use all six only when 
necessary. We get about 20/24 mileage. It also has a 5 star crash rating, and 
seats 7, 6 very comfortably. It costs a little more up front, but the oil 
change only reliability more than makes up for it. American car makers ignored 
the lessons of their foreign competitors for decades to the detriment of the 
environment and their own bottom line.</p> <br>

<p>I agree that I may need sensitivity training, however as this is my opinion 
(as I strongly stated in my post) I stand by it. Every single environmental 
problem we have is due to overpopulation. Every single one. I know our 
Judeo-Christian upbringings say to &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; but you 
can't do that in a world with almost seven billion people. The UN predicts 10 
billion in 2030 and up to 20 billion in 2100.
http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/longrange2.htm<br>
 
There are simply too many people, and the only way I know how this happens is 
people having too many babies. Just to clarify further, I am married and have 
zero children, nor do I ever plan to have any.<br>
 AP: I obviously think 
someone who adopts a child is doing good, and not contributing to the 
population problem, please don't be obtuse.</p> 
<p>Now, to get back on topic, A wagon (like a used Taurus or Century or 
Mercedes) that has a rear facing seat is an option, but ask your kids if they 
want to ride around backwards for the next six years, those seats (and the 
entire car in the case of the Century) are nowhere near as safe as a proper 
forward facing seat. This also eliminates all the luggage space. If I am not 
mistaken the Taurus X and Mazda 5 have almost no luggage space while in 6 seat 
mode. You could however get a smaller van like the Mazda 5 for around town and 
then rent a larger vehicle when you go on trips but I assume you will want to 
take equipment to soccer practice or be able to bring groceries home so a 
regular minivan is the better buy.</p> <br>

<p>We purchased a 2008 Toyota Highlander HYBRID in January 2008. It is a 
fantastic car. We have averaged 23.3 MPG for the first 28,000 miles (yes, we 
drive a lot). Highway mileage can easily hit 27 - 28 MPG on a long trip.</p> 
<p>The car is very comfortable, especially the back seat (and the 3rd row).</p>
<p>And if you've never owned a hybrid - you are in for a (positive) surprise. 
Most people that buy them quickly think &quot;now why aren't ALL cars hybrids? 
It just makes so much sense...&quot;</p> 
<p>Ok, it is a bit pricey, but if you want to encourage the auto companies to 
move down the cost curve on hybrids, someone has to buy them NOW.</p> <br>

<p>I like the recommendation from Bike Commuter Dude (I'm also a bike commuter 
dude), Keith and JB. Mazda 5 makes a lot of sense although Honda Odyssey and 
Toyota Sienna are better in their repair record. None of them, however, is an 
American brand. I had a Toyota van for 20 years with very little problems 
(25-26 mpg). It was cheap and reliable to own. If I had to trade my bicycle in 
someday and start a family of 6, any of the above would be my choice.</p> <br>

<p>Mr. Wright, I applaud your decision not to procreate, because, judging by 
your opinions, you shouldn't. Every one of our environmental problems is caused 
by overpopulation? seriously? Environmental problems are not caused by 
overpopulation, but by poor stewardship. I'll bet your family of 2 has a larger 
per-person carbon footprint than my family of 5.<br>

<p>How about irresponsible use of natural resources? How about choosing a 
four-wheel drive vehicle when in this day and age, almost no one in the 
continental US needs one? How about the incessant desire for many Americans to 
have-it-all and have-it-now?</p>

<p>OK, a quick explanation. We can have it all and we can be wasteful while 
doing it if there are less of us. Not to oversimplify, but most wars have been 
fought over land need to increase the space a society needed to spread out its 
population growth. The disease outbreaks of the last few centuries were due 
mostly to too many people living on top of each other in cities. The tiny 
amount of pollution that your car makes can be easily absorbed into the 
atmosphere if there are only a few cars on the roads (this is why the country 
has cleaner air than the city). Water and crop shortages are not a system of 
the environment, they are caused by too many people needing that water and 
those crops. There is enough oil and gas still around to last millions of years 
if there were only a few million people using it. Mountaintop removal for 
mining would not be necessary if there were less people to heat and keep in air 
conditioned houses. I can go on...</p> 
<p>We can live and we can live extremely well if we live under a billion 
people worldwide.</p> <br>

<p>Depending on the year of the Ford Windstar, you might want to keep it. You 
can get a car review on Edmunds.com for the Windstar and any of the other 
options people suggested. A lot of cars go farther than 100,000 miles. I have a 
88 Diesel F250 with 250,000 on it (being Diesel rated to 400,000) and a 99 
Subaru wagon with 160,000 on it.</p> 
<p>Also I reviewed a 97 Windstar on Edmunds.com and I think if you buy a new 
Minivan you might be impressed by the functions and performance. They have come 
a long way and have better fuel economy . The foriegn cars will last longer 
unless you are really lucky or you find something diesel.</p> 
<p>As far as Kevin's comments, it was rude and insensitive. But you are the 
really the minority and I applaud you. Overpopulation is destroying this world. 
I believe that it is the duty of educated people to limit there child bearing, 
but more so educate the general public. We have so many hurdles to overcome in 
the next centuries, overpopulation is something we can control individually.</p>
<p>I hope your old/new car works out. Sorry if your post turned into &quot;how 
to save the world&quot;. I think that's on everyone mind right now.</p>

<p>The idea of &quot;buying American&quot; is almost moot. Many American cars 
are actually manufactured in Canada and Mexico while there are Toyota and Mazda 
plants here in the U.S. Besides, with a family of six, can you really afford a 
car payment? Do you want that payment dogging you for the next 5 or 6 years? A 
greener and more affordable choice would be a used fuel-efficient vehicle. P.S. 
If you're looking for a &quot;pimp-mobile&quot;, forget it. You have 4 kids who 
probably eat and drink in the car. Don't blame them for the mess because you 
eat in there too and you're the one that gives them the food. Let's not forget 
the carseats, diaper bags (with dirty diapers), and whatever else you don't 
feel like hauling into the house. Have you consulted with the other adult in 
the house who is also sharing the parenting duties? Do they want to &quot;pimp 
a new ride&quot; like you or would they be satisfied with just a decent running 
vehicle that fits everyone?</p> <br>

26 mpg combined city/highway. It is more expensive than other 6-passenger 
vehicles, though, and Consumer Reports says the 3rd row is tight. Given that 
6-year-old is probably only going to get bigger, it might not be a long-term 
solution even if it would work for the short-term.</p> 
<p>Of the vehicles that have ample 3rd row seating, it looks to me like the 
Honda Odyssey when equipped with Variable Cylinder Management has the highest 
combined fuel economy at 20 mpg, and it's assembled in Lincoln, Alabama.</p> 
<p>I'm sure the Honda Pilot would be a very reliable car, but it has a bit 
lower fuel economy rating than the Odyssey (19 mpg combined) and (apparently) a 
tighter 3rd row.</p> 
<p>If you really want a U.S., UAW-built car, the previously-mentioned Taurus X 
(which was originally called the Freestyle) has an ample 3rd row, the 
front-wheel drive version is rated at 19 mpg combined, Consumer Reports 
recommends it and says it's had average reliability, it's built in Chicago, and 
it will be discontinued after this model year, so you can probably get a great 
deal on one given the state of the economy. You might be able to find an even 
better deal on a lightly-used Taurus X/Freestyle. The Freestyle version didn't 
come with electronic stability control, however, and Consumer Reports says the 
Taurus X version equipped with ESC handles much better during avoidance 
maneuvers.</p> 
<p>It comes down to what your highest priorities are, of course, because there 
are always trade-offs.</p> <br>

<p>Might I suggest an option few people have suggested here? My feeling is 
that the best way to preserve resources and be environmentally responsible is 
to Recycle- Reuse-Repair AND to invest in the most well-made products with a 
long life cycle that stay out of the waste stream. Therefore, I stick with 
buying well-maintained used Volvos. In 2001 I bought a 1992 740 wagon with 
83,000 miles on it. I drove it 110,000 additional miles, mostly highway at 26 
mpg, during which time it required minimal maintenance and few repairs. I sold 
it 6 months ago, still running beautifully to a family who plans to maintain 
and keep it for years. That model has been known to run as much as 500,000 
miles with its original drive train. In its place I bought another 
well-maintained Volvo wagon, a '95 850 with 115,000 miles on it. So far it has 
averaged 23 mpg highway and comfortably sits 6 adults, with room for 2 more in 
a pinch (it has the rear seat.) I can also haul two or three 17' sea kayaks in 
it, camp in the back with the seats stashed and have hauled all the cabinets 
and counter tops for my kitchen remodel from IKEA in it. And, of course, 
Volvo's are among the safest cars on the road.</p> 
<p>To me, avoiding &quot;disposable&quot; products, especially those which 
consume a large quantity of resources to produce and result in substantial 
residue in the waste-stream when they wear out, is something we should all 
strive for. What has a greater impact on the environment: maintaining one 
well-constructed vehicle for 300,000 to 400,000 miles or buying and disposing 
of 3 or 4 more shoddily built units, no matter how &quot;energy efficient&quot; 
they are?</p> 
<p>Of course, some will argue that consumer turnover of goods drives the 
economy but that is another principle we need to get beyond to increase 
sustainability. Planned obsolescence and the Wal-Mart ethic of cheap and 
disposable goods is no longer a realistic approach. If we are all willing to 
pay a little more for stuff that lasts and that can be realistically 
maintained, we can shift the economics of production to a more sustainable 
model.</p> 
<p>My latest car cost me less than $4,000, even less if you deduct the $1,500 
I sold the previous car for, which is also likely to stay out of the waste 
stream indefinitely. We should not only be demanding vehicles that run 
efficiently but that hold up better, so that their parts and carcasses don't 
pile up and need to be replaced more often (not to mention the environmental 
costs of mining the raw materials, energy expenditures in manufacturing and 
transport, etc.) Building stuff that lasts can be done. But we all have to be 
willing to give up our culturally engrained &quot;need&quot; for constantly 
getting something new and shiny.</p>

<p>Kerry:</p> 
<p>The Honda Pilot was redesigned for the 2009 model year, and the current 
generation is roomier than the one your brother bought.</p> 
<p>Volvos do tend to be reliable, but they're not particularly fuel-efficient 
and any car from 10 or more years ago is going to emit significantly more toxic 
air pollutants than even a conventional car from the last few years, and far 
more than most hybrids. The damaging health effects of air pollution from autos 
gets far too little attention. Check out Terry Tamminen's book Lives Per 
Gallon: The True Cost of Our Oil Addiction for a good overview.</p> 
<p>Also, older used cars--even Volvos--have less effective safety features 
than those available in recent years, including improved crumple-zone 
engineering, side-curtain airbags, better seatbelts, and electronic stability 
control systems. \</p> 
<p>Moreover, Toyota's hybrids have proven to be extremely reliable according 
to Consumer Reports.</p> 
<p>Of course, deciding the best ecological use for one's own money is always a 
challenge. One can certainly save a lot of money upfront by buying a reasonably 
fuel-efficient used car versus buying a new or lightly-used Prius. If one uses 
that saved money to weatherize one's home and install a ground-source heat 
pump, one may well produce greater ecological benefits overall. Everyone has to 
make those kinds of calculations on their own.</p> 
<p>Whatever auto one drives (if any), it's important from an eco-perspective 
to buy one with the passenger and cargo capacity one uses frequently, not with 
capacity one uses a few times a year. In those circumstances, it's better to 
borrow or rent for those instances rather than haul excess metal and plastic 
around for the great majority of the year.</p> <br>

<li>  41. By Kerry on April 8, 2009 9:24 AM <br>

<p>I completely agree with the &quot;buy for most frequent use&quot; principle 
the previous poster brings up. I can't tell you how many people I've known who 
justified their purchase of a gas-guzzling, polluting truck or SUV and use it 
daily &quot;because we need the horsepower to haul our 
trailer/boat/snowmobile&quot; a few times a year. Frankly, I see no 
justification for any 4-wheel drive vehicle unless one lives far up a dirt 
road. They are inefficient and more prone to serious accidents. They also give 
people a false sense of security in driving in bad conditions -- they are, in 
fact, less controllable on dry and wet pavement. I learned how to drive 
properly in ice and snow and can negotiate better with a normal 2-wheel drive 
car than most people in their 4WD's who have no clue how to operate them. Plus, 
we need to bring back the manual transmission. I prefer them, they are more 
energy efficient, improve performance in all conditions and are simpler to 
repair. Also they demand more consistent driver attention, a good thing in this 
era of distracted driver multi-tasking.</p> 
<p>And honestly, to return to the original question, how much 
&quot;space&quot; do you really need in a transport device? Our family of five 
survived (including 1,100 mile drives to Grandma's) driving a VW beetle for 
many years. Maybe if the quarters are cramped, you'll think twice about whether 
a trip is all that necessary and how often you use the car. Our car wasn't a 
luxury extension of our playroom. We learned to sit quietly and share the 
limited elbow room with our siblings graciously, watching the passing world 
outside as we travelled instead of fussing with toys, food and other clutter 
for which there was no room in our Beetle. We viewed it as sort of a space 
capsule. How often do you really need to haul all 6 members of the family? 
Would having 2 smaller cars, or even just one, be more practical and, in the 
long run, less polluting if most of your mileage is one adult commuting? Every 
family's situation is different but we should all think hard and out-of-th-box 
about how we can use our vehicles more efficiently rather than automatically 
getting some big honking thing that meets the rare worst-case scenario with 
maximum comfort. In our city we even have a car-sharing program where people 
can use vehicles from the fleet on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis.</p> 
<p><br>
 Point taken that an older car may be &quot;more polluting&quot; than 
a newer one. But in my PA county we have annual emission inspection, which mine 
always pass (I keep the systems maintained). And as for safety, few cars can 
match the Swedish-era Volvos in any severe crash due to the structural 
integrity of their steel roll-cage design. Check the NHTSA ratings if you have 
any doubt.</p> 
<p>Overall, the best thing I've done personally to reduce my vehicular 
&quot;footprint&quot; is to arrange to live within 3 miles of my workplace 
(with the option to take public transport or bike to work) and to minimize my 
driving. Currently I drive less than 2,500 miles per year, 75% less than the US 
average.</p> <br>

<p>Simply because your Volvo passes the Pennsylvania emissions test does not 
mean that your emissions are as low as those of current autos, and certainly 
not as low as Advanced Technology-Partial Zero-Emission Vehicles like the 
Prius, Camry and Highlander Hybrids and the Honda Insight and Civic Hybrids. 
Surely you don't think the Pennsylvania emissions requirement is stringent 
enough to genuinely protect people from petroleum pollution, do you?</p> 
<p>The oldest Volvo wagon I can find an EPA Air Pollution Score for is the 
2001 V70, which rates a 2 or a 3 depending on the engine and transmission 
combination. In comparison, the Prius rates an 8 or a 9.5 depending on which 
state you buy it in (California and certain other states require better 
emissions controls). Even the entry-level Toyota Yaris rates a 6 or 7, again 
depending on where you buy it.</p> 
<p>The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration New Car Assessment 
Program's crash test ratings for the '95 Volvo 850 (at SaferCar.gov) are only 
for a frontal impact test. NHTSA didn't do side impact tests that long ago, and 
the side and side-curtain airbags that have only recently become common make a 
huge difference in side impact crashes--the t-bone crashes that typically 
happen at intersectinons. In particular, the side-curtain type reduce the 
severity of head injuries dramatically.</p> 
<p>The '95 850 wasn't available with electronic stability control, either, 
which helps prevent loss of control during avoidance maneuvers or when going 
too fast around a corner.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the NHTSA tests do not emulate real-world crash conditions well. 
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's frontal-offset and side impact 
crash tests are more similar to real-world crashes. The IIHS explains the 
multiple ways cars have become safer in recent years overall at

<p>One statistic I have not yet seen (though I imagine it must exist 
somewhere) is this: what is the pollution/environmental cost 
&quot;footprint&quot; in the initial production of an entirely new vehicle, 
regardless of its ultimate functional emissions? I work in electrical design 
and this &quot;payback&quot; period is something we always calculate in 
recommending energy-saving upgrades. I find myself often disturbed by the 
current marketing trends of &quot;save the earth by buying some new 
stuff&quot;. That &quot;stuff&quot;, whatever it is, generally has some 
environmental cost in production. I cringe when I see home renovation shows 
where people rip out perfectly functional kitchens, baths, flooring, whatever, 
dumping the debris in a landfill and replacing them with new &quot;sustainably 
produced&quot; or &quot;recycled&quot; materials. I realize cars are different 
in that they constantly generate pollutants over their lifetime, but isn't 
striving to reduce usage, period, of private existing vehicles at least as 
efficacious to the environment as scrapping old cars and replacing them with 
new ones whose production consumed/polluted a large amount of resources?</p> 
<p>Where is the &quot;break-even&quot; point in a new car in terms of overall 
environmental cost (of mining/refining/smeltering/casting/machining the metals, 
plastics, hardware, chemicals that make up the new car and the transport and 
waste stream expenditures that are necessary to deliver another 1500 to 4000 
pound hunk of &quot;stuff&quot; onto the giant pile of collective junk humans 
generate. How many gallons of fuel and tons of emmissions must one save in 
using the new car (compared to the old one) to offset this cost of production?

<p>Hi, Kerry. The best answer I know of to your question is the post below 
from the Union of Concerned Scientists Hybrid Center blog (this post is online 
athttp://hybridblog.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/08/hybridcenter_qa.html). More 
info about automobile lifecycle environmental assessment can be found in the 
post at this address:
http://hybridblog.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/08/about_that_cnw_.html.</p> 
<p>HybridCenter Q&amp;A: To Trade or Not to Trade?</p> 
<p>Interesting question that I thought might be more widely informative:</p> 
<p>Q: A friend of mine drives a 25-year-old gas guzzler. His mileage is 
terrible, but he thinks he's probably doing the ecologically right thing by 
holding on to his old car, given the resources and energy required to make a 
new car. I had never considered this angle, which seems crucial to acting in an 
environmentally responsible way.</p> 
<p>I wonder if either of you have ideas about this or know of a resource to 
consult to help one assess the full impact of one's consumption. Trading your 
old station wagon for a Prius, or recycling your old air conditioner and buying 
a newer, more efficient model, is it really saving energy?</p> 
<p>A: A variety of reputable investigators have concluded that 85-90 percent 
of energy use and global warming emissions attributable to an average vehicle 
over its entire lifecycle come from operation. Only 10-15 percent is production 
and disposal. This is true for both hybrids and conventional vehicles.</p> 
<p>In order to achieve a net reduction in per-mile global warming emissions, 
(i.e. to offset the additional emissions from manufacturing and disposing of 
another vehicle) the new vehicle will have to get 10-20 percent better fuel 
economy than the old vehicle, assuming the vehicle will be driven in a typical 
way (i.e. that it will be used for its full useful life - usually around 
170,000 miles).</p> 
<p>Or, to look at it a different way, how long would it take to offset the 
manufacturing and disposal energy associated with the new car?</p> 
<p>Assuming 15 percent of lifetime energy use for the new car is manufacturing 
and disposal, and a lifetime of 170,000 miles, you can calculate the miles 
which you need to drive in order to make up for the manufacturing and disposal 
of the new car, using the following formula:</p> 
<p>Miles = 25,500 / (MPG_new / MPG_old - 1)</p> 
<p>For example, suppose his old vehicle gets 15 mpg and he's considering 
replacing it with one that gets 35 mpg. As soon as he's driven 25,500 / (35 / 
15 - 1) = 19,100 miles, he will have already made up for the energy and global 
warming emissions that went into producing that vehicle. For the remaining 
150,000 miles of the new vehicle's life, the reductions in global warming 
pollution are all &quot;profit.&quot;</p> 
<p>That's not to say he should drive his old car another 19,000 miles. Not at 
all. So long as he replaces the old car with one that gets at least 10-20 
percent better fuel economy, he should make the replacement right away. In 
certain situations, it may take longer for fuel savings to make up for the 
manufacturing emissions. For example, if the driver does very little driving, 
it will take longer to offset the manufacturing emissions, and it may be worth 
discounting future emissions - something that's beyond the scope of the current 
discussion.</p> <br>

<p>Kevin and all:</p> 
<p>1st, let me make clear I agree with you that we need to reduce the global 
average number of children per woman if we're going to avoid catastrophe. I 
think we need to bring it down to replacement level, at least (which would lead 
to population stabilization some years in the future), and probably below, for 
a while, to actually reduce our civilization's claim on global biocapacity and 
free up some for the other species in the community of life. If we don't stop 
population growth by choice, through smaller families, I'm convinced it will be 
stopped by catastrophe. Instead of the number of children coming down by our 
voluntary choices, deaths will rise from hunger, disease, war, and so on.</p> 
<p>The central problem, however, is not <i>population</i> growth but growth, 
period. It doesn't really matter what portion ofthe total growth in our claim 
on the planet's biocapacity comes from the growing size of our population and 
what portion comes from rising per capita consumption levels. In fact, in 
recent years, the global population growth rate has declined significantly 
(though the Census Bureau still estimates the yearly addition to the Earth's 
population to be around 80 million people a year because the base population is 
~6.8 billion people) while per capita consumption has been rising dramatically 
due to the increasing industrialization of countries like China, India, and 
Brazil and continued growth in some industrialized countries, including the 
U.S. (though the economic crisis has interrupted that trend). The U.S. doesn't 
have a very high population density, so most people don't consider it to be 
overpopulated. At ~306 million people, however, the U.S. is the 3rd most 
populous nation in the world which, coupled with its very high per capita 
consumption rates, makes it arguably the most overpopulated nation in the 
world, asPaul Ehrlich pointed out years ago. </p> 
<p>Even so, I think your approach to this issue has been clumsy, presumptuous, 
and even counterproductive. 1st of all, you wrote your 1st reply as if the 
6-member family described in the original post was made up of a mother, father, 
and 4 biological children--an awfully big assumption in today's U.S. of 
divorce, remarriage, and merged families plus common adoption. At least one 
person who responded to you, AP (who may've been the author of the original 
post), has 1 biological child and 3 adopted children. Did you even consider 
that possiblity? If so (and if you were still determined to make your point), 
it would've been best to acknowledge that possibility before going on to make 
your argument that we need to have fewer children in addition to buying the 
most fuel-efficient vehicles our families will fit in and offsetting the 
emissions with TerraPasses.</p> 
<p>Moreover, plain text is a terrible medium for dealing with 
emotionally-charged subjects (and I can think of few more emotionally-charged 
than the choices people make about how many children to have) because all the 
nonverbal elements of communication (tone of voice, expression, body language, 
and so on) are absent. If we're going to address the subject of population 
growth in plain text, we need to take all of this into account and be very 
careful how we approach it--unless what we care about is being 
&quot;right&quot; rather than reaching other people and making a positive 
impact.</p> <br>

<p>Thank you, John Kurmann, for the information from the Hybrid Center Q &amp; 
A. Based on that calculation, with my annual driving distance of around 2,500 
miles, it would take over 15 years for me to &quot;break even&quot; off-set the 
environmental cost of production of a new 35 mpg vehicle to replace my 20 mpg 
1995 Volvo. Seems better for me to continue my efforts to drive less than buy a 
new car before this one wears out.</p> 
<p>While I appreciate your concern for my safety (in pointing out the lack of 
stability control and other technological &quot;safety&quot; updates on my 
older Volvo) my feeling is that becoming a safe, defensive and skilled driver 
is more effective than any &quot;feature&quot; in protecting oneself on the 
highway. I've taken several high-speed driving courses which included hands-on 
practice in rapid maneuvering, evasion, effective braking and skid control in 
severe conditions. I'm also a focused and alert driver at all times. I figure 
I've driven at least half a million miles in 40 years behind the wheel of 
vehicles ranging from a VW Beetle to a Saab Sonett to a full-sized Dodge van 
and have NEVER been involved in a collision other than being rear-ended when I 
was at a full stop (my Volvo's frame was out of line but intact, with 
superficial body damage -- the Toyota that hit me crushed to the windshield and 
was totalled.) And that includes over 100,000 miles in Michigan, whose highways 
full of largely unregulated vehicles essentially constitute a 
publicly-maintained Demo Derby.</p> 
<p>Again, I restate that making the effort to constructively change our 
behaviors and lifestyles can have as much or more of a positive impact on 
outcomes, for ourselves and our environment, than does simply throwing money at 
a new product that allows us to maintain our existing &quot;comfortable and 
careless&quot; consumption habits with a little less environmental cost.</p>

been that, for many people, the safety and ecological benefits of buying a new 
hybrid or a more fuel-efficient new vehicle can be a worthwhile investment. I 
don't presume to know what the wisest choice for any specific individual will 
be.</p> <br>

<p>The tired argument that the world is overpopulated so we should stop having 
kids is not well though out.</p> 
<p>If the original poster is looking for a new car, obviously he is a wise 
steward of his own resources. His ceasing to have children will not stop the 
real overpopulation problems in third-world countries.</p> <br>

<p>I have to ask: what is &quot;tired&quot; about the argument that the world 
is overpopulated? Sorry, but that fact is a given. Being &quot;tired&quot; of 
hearing it in no way renders it irrelevant. Among the statistics: one in six 
people is starving at any given time; over 40% of previously arable land is no 
longer productive; 75% of fisheries are damaged or collapsing -- I should not 
need to go on.</p> 
<p>But what is &quot;not well thought out&quot; is the premise that an 
American is a &quot;wise steward of his own resources&quot; because he feels he 
needs a new car, a large 4-wheel drive one, to boot. Each American on average 
consumes SIX TIMES the global per capita average and nearly TWENTY TIMES more 
energy than the average resident of developing nations like India, not to 
mention vastly more water and cropland due to higher consumption of meat and 
processed foods. The calculations I have seen are that the birth of a middle 
class American child will have between 40 and 100 times the negative impact on 
planetary resources that the birth of a rural third world child will have over 
the course of their life.</p> 
<p>I'm not passing moral judgment on people's personal imperative to 
reproduce. But, let's be honest here: whose birth rate truly has a greater 
impact on consumption of global resources?</p> <br>
