<p>Although the EPA has come a long way in rehabilitating its reputation as a 
creditable source of mileage numbers, that newfound respectability could be 
suffering a hiccup with the all-new,2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid. What's the buzz 
about? Two numbers -- 41 and 36 -- which the government has certified as the 
midsizeFord's official city and highway ratings. Trouble is, our early 
observations have theFusion's overall number floating around 33.5 mpg. Hey, 
that's an excellent result in our book. Except that it leaves a yawning, 5-mpg 
disparity betwixt it and the government's combined average of 38.5.</p> 
<p>So what's up with the Fusion? I called Praveen Cherian, Ford's Hybrid 
Program leader to find out</p> 
<p>&quot;So, Kim, what mileage did you get...?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Umm, about 33 and a half.&quot; Silence. Darn, there goes getting 
added to Ford's Christmas card list yet again.</p> 
<p>&quot;So what kind of driving was that?&quot; Praveen calmly followed up.

<br>

<p>&quot;About 500 miles of typical mixed use -- highway driving, city 
driving; you know, everything you'd do with a car.&quot; I sensed a vibe of 
disappointment and decided to change the subject.</p> 
<p>In retrospect, though, there was nothing to be disappointed about. While 
our early experience suggests the real-world mileages of the Fusion and 
gold-standardCamry are closer than Ford might like, that doesn't mean the 
Fusion still isn't the better hybrid (and potentially capable of super mileage).
</p> 
<p>Better? It seems that hybrid buyers have now established a set of 
experiential expectations for what a &quot;good hybrid&quot; is. Requirments? 
It should start up exclusively in EV mode. Shut its engine down very quickly 
when it decelerates. Operate as an EV up to as high a speed as possible in the 
city and have its engine's relighting be unnoticeable. As Mr. Cherian points 
out, the primary benefit of a hybrid is its recapture of kinetic energy 
otherwise lost to braking. And then reusing it. On-board generation of 
electricity for filling in the engine's torque holes and whatnot, offers a 
smaller bang for the technological buck (the electricity's chemical storage and 
recovery involve not-inconsiderable losses). Notably, the pressure to meet 
these hybrid expectations is now so high that manufacturers will knowingly 
trade a little efficiency to deliver those experiential goods.</p> 
<p>And simply put, the Fusion delivers those subjective goods better than any 
hybrid on the market. Compared with theCamry Hybrid, its willingness to remain 
in EV mode is delightful (up to 47 mph while tickling the accelerator -- see 
our graphic of measurements gleaned from OBD2 port to prove it). The volume 
level of its EV-audio experience has just enough whine to provide that vital 
soundtrack of efficiency. But it's not so loud as to be annoying. And the trunk 
space is also noticeably less impacted by its battery pack.</p>

 I have 26,345 on my 2010 FFH and I can not understand how hard 
people must try to get some of these low mileage numbers. &nbsp;My all time 
average is 40.8 this has not been reset for probably 15,000 miles. &nbsp;My 
current running mileage with last reset around 3,000 miles ago is 41.8. &nbsp;
<br>I get mid 40's on the highway without doing anything except stay at 70 and 
below. &nbsp;I get anything from 30's to 70's in town driving depending on the 
charge of the battery and what accessories are running.<br>
It is best not to 
take off like a snail this uses up battery charge. &nbsp;You should take off 
moderate to the speed limit and then go into electric this will charge your 
battery and give longer all electric driving and with good charge 47 mph is 
easy for a short distance. &nbsp;I go 35-40 in all electric for miles with no 
problem driving like this. If I hyper mile I can achieve 50's to 60's in town 
on tank after tank. &nbsp;<br>
I have owned Fords for years and have had no 
major problem. Whens the last time youve seen an old Toyota on the road?

 We own a 2010 Fusion hybrid. This 
winter, when the engine had to run more to keep the body and batteries warm, we 
averaged 35 mpg mostly highway with about 25% city, now that it is warmer I 
usually get 38.5 mpg on the highway at 75 mph and get 41 mpg if I drive at 65 
instead. We have driven the Fusion Hybrid for 8,000 miles and have had zero 
problems with it. It is by far a superior vehicle, and best of all it is made 
by an American company. stvdude - 12/31/09 12:31 PM <br>
 THE FUSION IS THE 
BETTER HYBRID PanHandleWilly - 12/04/09 07:56 AM <br>
 TRD, I know this is some 
months old&hellip;but only a numbers geek, you, would ascribe any meaningful 
difference between the acceleration figures you quote. They're imperceptible in 
the cockpit. However, the gas mileage difference is perceptible...in fact it's 
significant. I have owned both makes of car. I have never had a problem with a 
Ford...ever...in 30 years of driving them. I have had major problems with the 
Toyotas I've owned: mushy cornering, broken a/c's, windows that quit working 
(major irritation), fabric that falls out and hangs, sun visors that won't stay 
where you put them, water pumps that quit working for no reason, battery 
connections that corrode continuously and have to be replaced, the list goes 
on. In short only a *** cool-aid drinkin, hype believing, storefront 'truck 
guy,' numbers geek, you, thinks the Camry Hybrid could be a better car. All 
reliable evidence clearly points to the Ford being a superior vehicle. 
PanHandleWilly - 12/04/09 06:58 AM <br>
 I take major exception to the mileage 
test. &nbsp;They drove about 300 miles. I have driven my Fusion Hybrid now for 
3000+ with no mileage reset and it is still averaging 42.7...better than 
advertised. &nbsp;I drive 31 miles to work one-way during rush hour on a US 
route with way too many stoplights, but it's flat. &nbsp;I keep up with traffic 
and don't annoyingly hypermile...and I'm averaging 42.7! &nbsp;My friend that 
drives a Camry hybrid in similar fashion gets 36 (and hers MPG guage 
auto-resets with every tank...hmmm...suspicious at best). &nbsp;This ain't 
'testing'...it's the real world. Short story Fusion wipes the floor with Camry. 
mxmastro - 10/29/09 12:56 PM <br>
 I am here to either throw fuel on this fire 
or help put it out. I have had the Fusion Hybrid for about 3 months now and I 
have put on 7324 Miles up until now. For the first 1-2K I was averaging around 
34MPG on the highway and around 39MPG in the city. Now I get around 44 in the 
city and 38 on the highway. If you read the manual it says that for the first 
2000 miles your mileage will be lower than the EPA estimates and then will 
slowly rise and the level off (it has something to do with the conditioning of 
the battery). Now if I watch my gauges religiously I am able to get in the high 
50s and mid 60s for city but no matter what I average 38 on the highway. I hope 
this helps. Additionally you can drive this car very aggressively and and 
average 37-38 with a mix of city and highway.  - 08/13/09 03:59 AM <br>
 I can 
tell you as an owner of the 2009 Camry Hybrid that Toyota give customers that 
expect reliability and a reasonable ride exactly what we want. This is my third 
Camry and I love it. My Camry in the DC area gets 41 MPG on a trip going 70 MPH 
and it gets 36.5 MPG going to work and back. I have owned 4 Fords in the past, 
all of them were terrible vehicles that on many occassions left me stranded. I 
looked that the Fusion, and drove it, but I was not impressed with the car at 
all. It seemed like the same typical Ford of the past which in a short time 
will fall apart and cost way more to maintain. I would buy an American based 
car if their quality ever improves to the same level as the Toyota brand. Since 
my car was made in Kentucky, I feel that I gave americans the work to build my 
car. I have no regrets. Good luck to anyone that buys the Fusion, you will 
certainly need it when it breaks down on you. Why else do they include roadside 
assistance? With Toyota, you will not need it. UltrafastPED - 08/02/09 09:52 AM 
<br>  I ordered a Ford Fusion 2010 Hybrid in February, and picked it up in 
March. &nbsp;It replaced a ten year old Ford Taurus.<br>
<br>
The Fusion hybrid 
drives great! &nbsp;I mostly drive around town, and my average after four 
months and 2500 miles is 41.3 mpg. &nbsp;I have lots of green leaves ... the 
only thing I do different is I start from standing stops a bit more slowly than 
before, based on the feedback from the green leaves.<br>
<br>
I made one long 
highway trip, 250 miles each way. &nbsp;The mileage on the outbound segment was 
54 mpg, and on the way back was 55 mpg. &nbsp;This is in Michigan, so the 
expressways are pretty flat, but I live in Ann Arbor, so the local driving has 
a lot of rolling hills.<br>
<br>
All-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase. 
&nbsp;I'm not sure why the reviewer got such low mileage ... perhaps he is a 
lead foot? TRDSmokedU - 02/09/09 05:19 PM <br>
 Fordtrucks, <br>
<br>
You and 
your redneck friends are the reason the AMERICAN auto industry is the way it 
is. You supported the junk they build. Don&rsquo;t ever put FOUND ON ROAD DEAD 
vehicles on the same level as any Japanese competitor. Funny a list from 
consumer reports shows the most and least reliable cars/trucks.<br>
<br>
Of the 
most reliable cars 37 out of 47 belonged to Japanese cars, 3 for America. Of 
the least reliable, 29 belonged to America and 2 belonged to Japanese. See a 
trend here?<br>

<br> <br>
And even JD power places Toyota above Ford in quality and 
dependability.<br>

So why don&rsquo;t you pick up a book and learn to read. This way you 
can get your facts straight because mine are. Ford is far from solid a solid 
turd maybe but that is pushing it. So please pack up your trailer and move to 
Mexico or Canada since this is where many of the Fords are being made! redms3 -

 Toyota Camry: Made in USA <br>
Ford Fusion: Made in 
Mexico<br>
<br>
Some times you have to wonder, which buy helps the US of A 
more-- and which one helps the Mexicans? The Camrys, although from Toyota which 
was started in Japan, are providing jobs for Americans and tax to the American 
government.<br>
<br>
Oh, that's right; the blindfold known as BIAS is doing its 
job, and that's what Chrysler and GM are counting on: bias.<br>
<br>
Seriously, 
if it wasn't for the bias, Ford would have improved its quality decades ago 
because they would have been hurting so bad!<br>
<br>
<br>
And as for my pick, 
I'd still go with the Fusion-- according to Consumer Reports, it is very 
reliable, and it is impressively efficient. I don't care about acceleration- I 
like fun-to-drive.<br>
<br>
Although if I were to get a hybrid, I would pass by 
both the fusion and the camry and head straight toward the new Insight and save 
my cash. FordTrucks77 - 01/21/09 07:12 AM <br>
 Hey Maverick430,Get a life pal! 
You and your *** car lovin buddies are the main reason the american auto 
industry is in the shape it is in. &nbsp;Ford is a solid ride. &nbsp;I have 
owned nothing but. &nbsp;Kept almost every one of them well over 200k and 
bought another one. &nbsp;The only thing I did was MAINTENANCE. &nbsp;Something 
that people like you don't do on a regular basis, and when something breaks it 
is automatically Ford's fault or GM's fault that they didn't engineer a vehicle 
that you can just drive without even changing the oil. &nbsp;And if you read 
Consumer Reports, which I don't believe you ever have, they have said countless 
times, that Ford has shown the most improvement out of all the American 
companies and their quality is just as good as toyrota and honda. &nbsp;So 
before you start with your &quot;driver returned on foot&quot; crap get the 
facts pal! &nbsp;And furthermore the only Fords that you have probably ever 
owned is a 80's Tempo or an early 90's Taurus. If you like the *** cars so much 
go live in Japan. TRDTundra - 01/19/09 06:15 PM <br>
 Coffee, <br>
<br>
I have 
driven and owned many fords, and I stand-by my opinion, they are crap. Do not 
assume you know what I have driven; you know what assuming makes of you? Fords 
are not solid, and according to consumer reports, they are not as highly ranked 
as the competition from toyota, honda, nissan, vw, subarau, and even mazda 
which they partly own. Do some research, there are many people with not as high 
MPG on the fusion. Drive a real car and you'll see the difference. Keep 
drinking that coffee, it has obviously gotten to your brain. FORD backward is 
Drivers, Return On Foot....You must one of the many biased Americans who cannot 
see the truth. coffeejolts - 01/19/09 01:37 AM <br>
 Seems like everyone + dog 
except MT is getting the claimed MPG from the Fusion. The guy that said Ford is 
crap obviously hasn't driven one outside of a rental fleet. I've had many 
Fords, and all have been good, solid vehicles. SoloSoldier - 01/16/09 03:49 AM 
<br>  I'm with the Camry because in 2 years, it will be redesigned while the 
Fusion will still be on this platform. Nice try though, but I find the Fusion 
design to be a bit gooey looking. It took Ford long enough to catch up with 
Toyota in the hybrid game and hopefully they'll stay up to task. Good job Ford, 
but Toyota continues to impress... Its like the valedictorian vs. most 
improved!! syj - 01/13/09 10:27 AM <br>
 Fusion looks better and has better 
handling and full tax credit. Its a no brainer. The mileage may be about equal 
but I'll take the Ford any day. dsavio - 01/11/09 08:19 PM <br>

<br>

Dan Neil from LA times get 52.8 mpg during media drives of the Ford Fusion 
Hybrid. Maybe customers will be willing to change driving habits to get those 
kinds of numbers.. TRDTundra - 01/11/09 06:01 PM <br>
 Please folks, tell me 
how you think the Fusion is a better performer? According to the numbers above 
and again printed here, the Camry is overall better. Camry to the right. Yep, 
the Camry may be plain, but according to consumer reports, the overall 
reliability and depreciation is much better than a crappy ford. Ford is crap, 
plain and simple and I am sorry many biased Americans fail to see it.<br>

Motortrend drivers tend to have a lead foot... (In all of their EPA tests of 
all cars)<br>
<br>
That said, the Fusion achieved 45 mpg on the other front 
page story today, versus the Altima Hybrid, in cold weather too!<br>
<br>
The 
Camry Hybrid was a good vehicle for it's day, but it's vanilla in 2009 and as 
of this moment now the Fusion is at least this year the honest winner. cleeto78 
- 01/10/09 01:54 AM<br>
 One more thing, &quot;The most glaring difference is 
probably the Fusion's hollow door handle thunk when it's released - what a 
silly thing to allow into production.&quot; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
What a 'silly' 
thing to nit pick about. cleeto78 - 01/10/09 01:51 AM <br>
 First of all, when 
has motor trend EVER gotten anything close to the EPA mileage for the cars they 
test?! &nbsp;Next, you guys make a terrible assumption that people won't change 
their driving behavior when behind the wheel of these things. &nbsp;Sport 
driving enthusiasts these cars' target market is not!! &nbsp;You should 
evaluate them like the buyers shopping them would. &nbsp;Frankly, I'm sick of 
you guys comparing everything to a Ferrari. &nbsp;That being said, great job 
Ford! &nbsp;This car is definitely a winner, even if the sticker price is 
slightly higher than the Toyota's the tax credit should bring it close or even 
lower than the Toyota. &nbsp;Toyota's tax credit expired last year.

 VTEC: The US Camry Hybrid is made in 
Kentucky -RWC- - 01/09/09 10:49 PM <br>
 Oh ya, the Camry Hybrid doesnt qualify 
for a tax credit anymore. <br>
-RWC- - 01/09/09 10:48 PM <br>
 No Doctor Phil, 
in the C@D comparo between the Camry, Fusion, etc. the Fusion was middle-ground 
in acceleration, had the best MPG, and it qualifies for a tax credit(the 
Fusion) so it is actually cheaper then the official granny mobile, much better 
looking, and you would be supporting American Jobs if you bought it, Camry 
Hybrid is built in Japan, not the US of A BTW. DrFill - 01/09/09 06:09 PM <br>
 
So the Camry was faster, more efficient, and cheaper, plus no 1st year teething 
issues, plus higher resale. _E60_ - 01/09/09 04:26 PM <br>
 yeah i gotta cheer 
for the home team on this one, the Fusion is CLEARLY better in every 
way/shape/form. Its got better performance, better new technology, and better 
gas efficiency. Of course its gonna win!! However, a few years from now when 
Toyota revamps the Camry hybrid, it will be much improved. Toyota and Ford will 
be playing leap frog with their new hybrid innovations for the next couple of 
years now, just watch GT500SprSnke - 01/09/09 03:33 PM <br>
 Camry's Crap. The 
Fusion is definatly way better. Although the taillights on the fusion look 
similar to the ones on the subaru legacys, which is somewhat disappointing. 
ToyotaNation - 01/09/09 03:15 PM <br>
 I will take Fusion. motortrend_online - 
01/09/09 02:31 PM<br>
 Couple of things to point out here: <br>
<br>
Car and 
Driver's test average over 300 miles with the Fusion Hybrid = 34 mpg<br>
<br>

If you read past the headline hype of Autoblog's review, they freely admit that 
most real world driving would be in the 35-37 mpg range. The 43 mpg they 
achieved was on a carefully scripted route by Ford, and not more than some 60 
miles in the car.<br>
<br>
Recording more than 40 mpg on the Fusion's trip 
computer is not hard if you work at it, see Frank Markus' blog for more on that:
<br> <br>

http://blogs.motortrend.com/6412966/green/cold-weather-hybrid-mpg-test-ford-fusion-hybrid-vs-nissan-altima-hybrid/index.html
<br> <br>
Kim Reynolds spent 500 miles in the car, and drove it in a number of 
different REAL WORLD scenarios.<br>
<br>
Can you achieve 40-plus MPG in the 
Fusion Hybrid? Sure. Will anyone driving it like you normally drive a car 
achieve those numbers on any sort of consistent basis? Highly doubtful.<br>
<br>
Of course, that's not to say that the Fusion Hybrid isn't a great piece of work 
by Ford overall, by all accounts it is. tamarack - 01/09/09 01:47 PM <br>
 MT- 
&quot;The EPA is perhaps more conservative with the Camry Hybrid: EPA-34 
combined mpg, fueleconomy.gov-36.4 mpg.&quot;<br>
MT- &quot;...our own 
long-term experiences with a Camry Hybrid (33.5 mpg) should be regarded as the 
lead-foot basement of the scale.&quot;<br>
<br>
With the similar size, power 
and mpg numbers during your comparison test, I too am perplexed by the EPA 
estimate of 41/36 for the Fusion Hybrid especially considering it has a smaller 
electric motor and greater weight. The 33.5 mpg you logged during your Fusion 
Hybrid test should also &quot;be regarded as the lead-foot basement of the 
scale&quot; but it seems very unlikely the Fusion Hybrid will achieve the EPA 
numbers (38.5) in real-driving.<br>
<br>
If the Fusion performs like the EPA 
says and possibly even better by the drivers at fueleconomy.gov, it will have 
set a new bar for mid-size hybrids. If it performs as well as you've shown, it 
is only stepping up to the competition and will be trailing again with a Camry 
redesign. Looks much better though. JefeMacheteAfilado - 01/09/09 01:47 PM <br>

 This is the very FIRST time that a car Magazine says the fusion isn't that 
fuel-efficient!<br>
<br>
In the Car and Driver Comparo, <br>
<br>
The Ford 
Fusion Actually Beat out the Camry in FUEL ECONOMY!<br>
<br>
Like someone 
quoted before that AUTOBLOG recorded 43 MPG in city driving!<br>
<br>
Most of 
Car magazines I have read so far have always said the Fusion is way more 
fuel-efficient in REAL WORLD MILEAGE.<br>
<br>
Something ISN'T Right here! 
chaise1984 - 01/09/09 01:36 PM <br>
 I find it funny that the Camry pretty won 
won outright on everything, but still wanted to make the fusion win. I think 
both these cars are winners, I like how long they went with it (I think it was 
because they were trying to make a case for the fusion) I really don't think 
they had to be becayse the Fusion does hold its own against the camry and did 
beat the camry in some areas. IN MY OPIONION though the camry is still the 
better pick here. With that said I still think both cars are winner, and the 
import fans and dom fans should just chill, we all know you will only buy for 
you home team. Damn I talk alot sometimes. JEinstein - 01/09/09 01:13 PM <br>
 
In all honesty, I would still buy the camry hybrid. Most likely because it's 
cheaper, faster, more fuel efficient in real life and it's quite popular. 
however, I must admit, based on looks; focus is better, way better. In the end, 
Toyota would have my money.<br>
<br>
Ford should stay alive so they can 
continue to make good looking cars. TSnow27604 - 01/09/09 01:07 PM <br>
 Why 
wouldn't people be willing to change their driving habits? &nbsp;End the 
ignorance. HighSpeed TheMxnBlood - 01/09/09 12:59 PM <br>
 THAT SAYS IT ALL!!! 
HighSpeed TheMxnBlood - 01/09/09 12:42 PM <br>
 This is so Weird! <br>
<br>

Autoblog recorded 43 MPG!!<br>
<br>
I Also remember MT editors Saying this!! 
<br> <br>
&quot;&quot;&quot;During the launch drive, I attempted to game the 
results by gunning away from stoplights and generally doing everything I could 
to burn up gas and electricity. Yet still I managed a fine 33.8-mpg average. 
Other drivers, carefully following the EcoGuide displays, were able to record 
city AVERAGES OF MORE OF 43 MPG on a similar route&quot;&quot;&quot; bbkk - 
01/09/09 12:40 PM<br>
 Even if the Fusion supposedly won it will probably be 
short-lived. &nbsp;Lets not forget the current camry hybrid is based on 4 year 
old technology and Toyota will be bringing out a new prius for 2010, which will 
undoubtedly find its way into the next camry as well. Proverbs - 01/09/09 11:53

 Cut to the chase: In the comparison of mileage and performance, the 
Camry won. The editors like the Fusion better.<br>

This was one piece that 
was too long, drawn out and a bit boring. The most interesting part was the 
mileage differences between MT and EPA. CarNYC - 01/09/09 11:40 AM <br>
 OK I 
might be a little interested. My pick would be the Fusion. It looks better and 
it provides the same all around performance than the Camry. TurboGSX04 -

 This is more of a comparison each car's tech and mileage, but there is a 
winner, ON PAGE 2: But first, we'll cut to the chase and right up front anoint 
the Fusion as our overall pick of the two. Providing the final nudge to the 
scale are the Ford's nifty new reconfigurable instrument pod, and more 
important, the Fusion's notably more involving driving experience. CarNYC -

 OH BOY HERE WE GO AGAIN! <br>
Another foreing vs 
domestic comparison.<br>
Let the war of bloggers begin!!!!! <br>
BTW, I'm not 
interested on this one. Registered Badass - 01/09/09 11:18 AM <br>
