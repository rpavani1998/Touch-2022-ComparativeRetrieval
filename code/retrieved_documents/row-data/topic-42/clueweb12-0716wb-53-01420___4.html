 Who does these articles? The 2 most fuel efficient 
trucks aren't even listed here. The honda Ridgeline is not a truck. It's a 
front wheel drive SUV, no frame, &nbsp;with a pickup box on it that can't pull 
more than 5000 lbs or haul more than 1500#. That's not a work horse. That's a 
hobby horse. And the NIssan Frontier. OMG please. Real world testing Ford has 3 
engines in 4x4s that get 21+ mpgs and in the 2wd they get 22+. Full size 
trucks!! Get you crap together. Geez.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11

 The best thing about is that the people who buy trucks know 
what to expect for mileage. Trucks are 25% better today than just 10 years ago. 
All these little 2 wheel drive pickups in this article are meaningless because 
nobody buys them because they can't do what they are needed to do. And, the 
people who buy trucks do so because the can afford to drive them regardless of 
mileage. It's really just a moot point. The only people complaining are the 
ones who can't afford to drive them but want to. I just wish the idiots that 
write these article would do their homework and get at least 1 article for MSN 
right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 <br>

<p>Dear Michael Warren. As for emissions, trucks ar eheld to the same 
standards no as cars. Diesels belch out just 1/2 of 1% of the pollutants they 
did just 7 years age. As far as sell the truck and the boat. How about this. 
Lets all get a hybrid or electric and turn into the robots that our beloved 
government wants us to be. I think you need a life. How was your fondu&nbsp; 
party last weekend?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Never fails...MSN posts an article about trucks and it's all the 
same.&nbsp; Some call those who drive imports un-American and claim they're 
destroying the country.&nbsp; Ford guys rip on GM an GM guys bring out the 
F(ound) O(n) R(oad) D(ead) acronym we've all heard.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Competition is a good thing people.&nbsp; &quot;Foreign&quot; trucks are 
made in the states.&nbsp; Made in the states mean Americans are being put to 
work.&nbsp; If foreign trucks weren't made here they wouldn't&nbsp;be given VIN 
numbers starting with&nbsp;a&nbsp;&quot;1&quot;.&nbsp; Look at the vin numbers 
while in the grocery store parking lot.&nbsp; You'll see a number of 2's and 
3's on American brands.&nbsp; 2 = built in Canada.&nbsp; 3 = built in Mexico</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&nbsp;personally like seeing them all compete for business.&nbsp; I like 
seeing the Big 3 pushed to better their products, the consumers win.&nbsp; I 
like to see&nbsp;foreign trucks introduce new ideas that take a hold in the 
market.&nbsp; Some of them not so brilliant but others take hold like the tie 
down systems now available.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In our world there's no such thing as a foreign company anymore.&nbsp; 
They're all publicly held.&nbsp; Aren't the big 3 shipping jobs overseas so to 
speak in order to sell their&nbsp;vehicles?&nbsp; I'm quite sure there are 
plenty of Americans on the assembly lines in this country (TN, MS, OH, 
etc)&nbsp;who are quite happy being employed even if it's a &quot;foreign&quot; 
company.</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 <br>

 Hey Drive-By Daisy. No your Tacoma doesn't have mare american 
parts in it than your ex-husbands Mustang. For your information the &quot;parts 
content&quot; on a vehicle is based on the country of origin that the companies 
that provide the parts are located. Toyota gets alot of their parts from what 
are apparently American companies but if you go to their websites you'll see 
that most of them are owned by Toyota and they are basically midddle men for 
imported parts. The fact is that the ownly benefactor to Toyotas sales other 
than the car dealer is Toyota. America doesn't get diddly. Fact:&nbsp;every 
foriegn car sold in America is worth $600 to our economy. Every American car 
sold is worth $6000 to our economy. Do the math honey!!&nbsp;

 The Honda Ridgeline is not a truck it is an SUV with no 
frame. Get it right. Left off the list was the Ford F150 with the 3.5L Ecoboost 
that hwy mpgs at 23. Not bad for a full size truck. Obviously the writer is 
going by the sticker and not real world testing. He or she didn't actually 
drive these to see for themselves because if they had there is only 1 truck on 
your list that gets what they advertise in real world testing. GM just got 
their buts chewed for fudging on the MPG ratings. DO YOUR HOMEWORK MORON! I 
hate when the janitor is asked to fill in!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8

 Ford Trucks 
continue to be the #1 seller based on price not durability or quality. 
Government Agencies buy vehicles based on a standard set of specs. Ford is very 
consistent in winning Government bids due to the fact they build more 
&quot;plain jane&quot; vehicles than anyone in the world.&nbsp;This is not 
speculation just plain old facts from&nbsp;working in Government Fleet sales 
for over 30 years. Government Fleets buy thousands of plain white&nbsp; Ford 
trucks every year based on low bid price and nothing 
else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12

<p>Love all the comments. </p> 
<p>I always love the blind loyalty to the American car makers. </p> 
<p>Loyalty is a 2 way street. </p> 
<p>I actually worked for a outsource company for one of the big 3 - and it was 
quiet enlightening. (i.e. the tolerance level for rusted parts to be placed 
into a new vehicle) I am sure the consumer would like to know that bit of 
information before buying a new vehicle.</p> 
<p>I am a proud American, I love my country, I served in the military for 
years.</p> 
<p>I am ashamed at what rolls off the assembly line for the big 3. It's 
embarrassing.</p> 
<p>Simply sit in a car and compare the ergonomics, the logical display of the 
controls, etc.</p> 
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t convince you, open a consumer reports or consumer 
digest and look at the ratings for the reliability alone. Its shameful.</p> 
<p>USA CAN make great cars and trucks. We just don't. We have our priorities 
screwed up. And let me qualify that - the people turning the nuts and bolts on 
the assembly line build what is in front of them. Hats off to them. The issue 
is at the top down. Selling the new, shiny design that everyone is supposed to 
fall in love with. I will admit the new Ford 150 looks very cool. But how will 
it stand up over time.</p> 
<p>I recently rented a Chevy Malibu. you could tell whoever designed it, 
couldn&rsquo;t have cared less. It was a throw together car. Complete trash. 
But the American public is supposed to blindly buy it? Not a chance.</p> 
<p>I love my country, I just wish we would pull our head out of our a** and 
get back in and own the game.</p> 
<p>Not likely to happen anytime soon, until we are firmly against the ropes.

<h1>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h1> 
<p>By&nbsp;the editors&nbsp;of&nbsp;Popular Mechanics</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<p>Does your truck get 27 miles per gallon? The day-in, day-out contractor 
will scoff at such a question &mdash; as he drives away in the big, powerful 
heavy-dutydiesel truck that he needs to make a living. But for those of us who 
want a truck body &mdash; still able to haul plenty of stuff &mdash; with less 
power and a lot bettergas mileage, there are plenty of trucks out there for 
you. Here are the top 10 most fuel efficient 2011 trucks.</p> 
<p><strong>Popular Mechanics:</strong> The Top 10 Cars of 2011: Auto 
Excellence Awards</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Dodge Ram 1500 Pickup 2W</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $20,810<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 20 
mpg hwy, 14 mpg city, 16 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> With 
one of the only V8 engines on this list, there is actually no difference in 
fuel economy between the Ram 1500's lesser 215-hp V6 and either the flex-fuel 
4.7L V8 or the powerhouse 5.7L Hemi V8 (good for 390 hp). Unfortunately, 
there's still a significant gap in price, with the top V8 model starting well 
into the $30Ks.</p> 
<p><strong>Bing Images:</strong> Dodge Ram 1500</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Honda Ridgeline Truck 4WD</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $29,150<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 20 
mpg hwy, 15 mpg city, 17 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> Despite 
its 4WD drivetrain, theHonda Ridgeline is still the least truck-like offering 
here, but offers the most civilized ride, thanks to itsOdyssey minivan 
platform. When we tested the Ridgeline, we found that its pleasant highway 
manners were a slight consolation for its sub-par abilities as a utility or 
off-road truck.</p> 
<p><strong>Popular Mechanics:</strong> Heavy-Duty Diesel Pickup Comparison Test
</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Dodge Dakota Pickup 2WD</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $23,210<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 20 
mpg hwy, 15 mpg city, 17 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> We 
haven't tested the 2011Dakota yet, but it is much the same middle-of-the-road 
truck that it was last year. The midsize Dodge pickup features a 3.7L Magnum V6 
as standard equipment, with a 4.7L V8 being the more enticing option, albeit 
one that would knock the Dakota off this list.</p> 
<p><strong>Bing:</strong> Dodge Dakota</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Toyota Tundra 2WD</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $24,435<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 20 
mpg hwy, 16 mpg city, 18 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> Like 
nearly everything here, the 2011Tundra made it into the top ten with its 
smallest engine and no 4WD. Luckily, the entry-level 4.0L V6 received a boost 
in power for 2011, now good for 270 hp and 278 lb-ft of torque.</p> 
<p><strong>Popular Mechanics:</strong> Lamborghini Brings Back the V12</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Chevrolet Colorado 2WD (GMC Canyon 2WD)</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $17,145 ($17,155)<br>
<strong>The Numbers:
</strong> 25 mpg hwy, 18 mpg city, 21 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:
</strong> The Chevrolet Colorado and its cousin the GMC Canyon carry over into 
2011 largely unchanged, much as they have since their introduction in 2004. The 
base 185-hp four-cylinder engine is more powerful than its direct competition, 
but it's also larger and thirstier.</p> 
<p><strong>Watch Video:</strong>&nbsp; 2010 Chevrolet Colorado</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Suzuki Equator 2WD</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $17,595<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 23 
mpg hwy, 19 mpg city, 21 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> Like the
Nissan Frontier on which it's based, the Suzuki Equator is the underdog player 
in the entry-level pickup truck arena, although its 7-year/100,000-mile 
warranty is definitely a plus.</p> 
<p><strong>Popular Mechanics:</strong> 11 Innovative Car Tools for the DIYer 
With It All</p> 
<h2>10 Most Fuel-Efficient Workhorses</h2> 
<h3>2011 Nissan Frontier 2WD</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $18,200 <br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 23 
mpg hwy, 19 mpg city, 21 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> The 
Tennessee-builtNissan Frontier has enjoyed moderate success since its 
introduction in 1997, perhaps in part thanks to its attempt at rugged

<h3>2011 Toyota Tacoma 2WD</h3> 
<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $16,365<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 25 
mpg hwy, 21 mpg city, 22 mpg overall<br>
<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> After 
moving production to San Antonio last year, the biggest change fromToyota on 
the 2011 Tacoma comes in the form of a price increase, although at least a/c is 
now one of the new standard equipment features. It's still one of the most 
affordable pickups out there, although its base 159-hp engine is bested by much 
of the competition.</p>

<p><strong>Base Price:</strong> $18,160<br>
<strong>The Numbers:</strong> 27

<strong>The Tradeoff:</strong> With a

Regrettably, however, the all-new (and significantly updated) 2011 Ranger that 
recently debuted at the Sydney Auto Show will not be seen on U.S. roads, at 
least not yet. We make do with a slightly updated version of last year's Ranger.
