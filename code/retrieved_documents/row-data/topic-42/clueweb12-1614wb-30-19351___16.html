<h2>Toyota and Ford Comparative Analysis</h2> 
<p>A Comparative Analysis of the HRM Policies of Toyota and Ford</p> 
<h3>1. Introduction</h3> 
<p>The closing decades of the twentieth century and the opening years of the 
current millennium have been periods of rapid and widespread change in global 
society. Spurred by opportunities provided by advances in technology, 
globalisation, and rapid economic growth, major business corporations have been 
able to spread their activities across continents, increasing their revenues 
and profits substantially. For business corporations, these increased business 
opportunities have come along with competitive challenges from new and old 
companies. Competition almost everywhere has become global in scope; businesses 
of all types in most countries face real or potential competition from foreign 
products or services, or from foreign-owned subsidiaries, and domestic firms, 
which are now foreign-owned.</p> 
<p>In the midst of this chaos, the need for top class Human Resource 
Management, experts believe, has never been as critical as now.</p> 
<p>The world of automotive manufacturing, for long the bell weather of 
industrial production, is also in the midst of sweeping shake-ups. Included in 
this revolution are extraordinary reorganisations of manufacturing processes, 
the surfacing of breathtaking technological developments, far reaching 
realignments of major corporations, numerous mergers, takeovers and pacts among 
industry members, and the phenomenal rise of Japanese auto makers. Giants like 
General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, who once dominated automobile 
manufacturing, are yielded their markets to much younger Japanese companies 
like Toyota and Honda. Toyota Motors, a Japanese car maker that commenced 
operations, in 1937, decades after GM and Ford established themselves, is now 
the biggest and most profitable car maker in the world.</p> 
<p>This report attempts to analyse the HR policies of Ford and Toyota, 
comparing their corporate philosophies on the issue, as well as their 
manifestation in HRM policies and practices at the ground level. Structured in 
successive sections, the report takes up the broad area of evolution of HR 
management and the challenges it faces in these days of internationalisation, 
followed by a comparative analysis of HRM at Ford and Toyota, and thereafter 
concludes with suggestions on the best possible approach for British 
expatriates who wish to work in the auto industry in Japan.</p> 
<h3>2. Human Resource Management</h3> 
<p>Human Resource management is best viewed as an inclusive term for 
describing a melange of distinctive approaches to people management. It has 
evolved from a number of different threads of thought and is most appropriately 
described as a loose set of theories about people management rather than a 
focused methodology. Over the years it has evolved and grown with inputs, often 
contradictory, from psychologists, management experts, corporate managers, 
industrialists, and business corporations. Theories put forward by Elton Mayo, 
Maslow, and Herzeberger, as well as practices adopted by Henry Ford, 
subsequently adopted and modified by Japanese companies, have all played 
distinctive roles in the evolution of HR Management.</p> 
<p>HRM is often also described as a concept with soft and hard forms, which 
firstly are diametrically opposed along a number of dimensions, and secondly 
are used to categorise approaches to managing people. Whilst the soft model is 
associated with the Hawthorne Effect, the Human Relations Movement, and 
McGregor&rsquo;s Theory Y perspective, as also with concepts of flexibility, 
communication, and adaptability, the hard model stresses on the quantitative 
and business-strategic aspects of managing employees like other factors of 
production, and where HRM practices are dovetailed into the strategic 
objectives of organisations. Even as western companies are increasingly using a 
mix of soft and hard concepts in constructing HRM strategies, Japanese 
businesses like Toyota have developed a people oriented &lsquo;Z&rsquo; theory, 
which places people at the centre of organisational activity and treats them as 
the most important organisational resource.</p> 
<p>HRM practices worldwide are being continuously shaped by fundamental 
changes that have occurred and are occurring in society and in the working 
space. Factors like diverse workforces, double income families, single 
parenting responsibilities, and teleworking, along with the realities of 
downsizing, employment-at-will agreements, and globalisation, have created 
challenges both for management and for organised labour. Decreased commitment 
between management and employees, temporary relationships, and less emphasis on 
employer sponsored career growth have not only fundamentally changed 
assumptions about careers and workforce but also led to anxieties and 
uncertainty. HRM practices in the UK have again been influenced by David 
Guest&rsquo;s six-dimensional HRM model, which includes HRM strategy, HRM 
practices, HRM outcomes, behaviour outcomes, performance outcomes, and 
financial outcomes.</p> 
<p>Managements of major corporations realise the complexity of current HR 
challenges and are trying to respond appropriately to optimise workforce 
effectiveness.</p> 
<h3>3. Analysis of HRM Policies at Ford and Toyota </h3> 
<p><em>Fordism and current HRM Practices at Ford Motors</em></p> 
<p>Much of the origins of Modern Human Resource Management can be traced back 
to developments in American industry in the early years of the 20th century, 
more specifically to the management and production policies initiated by Henry 
Ford at the Detroit factories of Ford Motors. Organising the workforce of the 
company on the same footing as other factors of production, Ford was 
instrumental in introducing the concepts of assembly lines, mass production, 
and the technical division of labour within companies and their production 
units. Fordism, as this set of personnel management practices came to be known, 
was identified with strong hierarchical control, extraordinarily good 
remuneration, (the five dollar day), and the restriction of workers to 
particular tasks, both skilled and unskilled.</p> 
<p>The emphasis in Fordism was on quantity, not quality, and workers were not 
allowed to involve themselves in any activity outside their specifically 
delegated functions. Fordism came to be associated with hierarchical decision 
making, strict functional specialisation, and tightly defined job design. With 
assembly line stoppages remaining unattended on purpose until the arrival of 
specialists, and workers knowing very little outside their specific areas of 
work, product quality in Fordism was allowed to be subordinated to the need to 
maintain and increase volumes. Ford Motors also saw the establishment of the 
first &ldquo;sociology&rdquo;, or employee welfare departments, in which 
managers tried to ensure that domestic problems were not allowed to impinge on 
assembly line productivity.</p> 
<p>Whilst absorption and utilisation of modern technology and design have 
always been associated with Ford&rsquo;s way of functioning, the company even 
today typifies the &ldquo;production model&rdquo; of HR, manifested by tough 
and consistent practice of industrial relations and a clear focus on the 
continuity of production. HR policies have continued to be hierarchical and the 
company organisation is known to be multi layered, bureaucratic, and with 
comparatively low levels of delegation and working independence.</p> 
<p>Reacting to the success of Japanese manufacturing practices, Ford initiated 
changes in its personnel policies in the early 1980s to bring in elements of 
Japanese HR practice. A number of measures for increasing participation and 
involvement of workers in Ford UK over the following years led to significant 
improvement in results. Performance Management imperatives were incorporated 
into the remuneration structure and problem solving groups, similar to quality 
circles, now flourish in the company. The company&rsquo;s Employee Development 
and Assistance Programme, which allowed for non-work, non-pay benefits for 
educational needs of employees also met with significant worker approval.</p> 
<p>Whilst Ford Motors is trying to make its HR policy more participative and 
focused on improving workforce skills and abilities, old bureaucratic practices 
still remain. Industry analysts assert that the company is manager heavy and 
that individual managers are prone to guard their own turf. It is estimated 
that Ford has 12 levels between the shop floor worker and the Chief Operating 
Officer (COO) compared to 4 for Toyota. Despite recent efforts to renew 
workforce participation, which resulted in thousands of suggestions, even 
transparently effective recommendations for improving productivity and cutting 
costs are difficult to introduce because of complex and time consuming 
procedures and the need for union acquiescence.</p> 
<p>Steady inroads made by trade unions over the years also means that all Ford 
workers are covered by contracts that include not just pay and benefits but 
also a broad range of shop floor actions. Productivity levels, once the glory 
of the company, is, at 37 hours per vehicle, much worse than Toyota&rsquo;s 
comparative figures of 27 hours. Strikes are not uncommon, not just at Detroit 
but also at Ford factories in other countries. A recent strike at Ford&rsquo;s 
Russian factory led to prolonged work disruption and resulted in across the 
board wage increases of more than 20% before production restarted.</p> 
<p>Whilst selection and recruitment policies at Ford are extremely structured, 
with salaries and working conditions being governed by union agreements, adding 
manpower is the last thing on the management&rsquo;s mind right now. The 
management, apart from selling off its Jaguar and Land Rover brands, has 
initiated a process of downsizing its American workforce by 30,000 workers, a 
proposal that has not been met kindly by its unions, and which is likely to be 
the company&rsquo;s chief HR focus in coming months.</p> 
<h3><em>The Toyota Phenomenon</em></h3> 
<p>Unlike Ford and GM, Toyota has been on a roll, opening factories and 
recruiting workers even as its American competitors vie with each other to 
close factories and terminate thousands of workers. The company became the 
largest car manufacturer in the world in 2007; it earned profits of more than 
11 billion US dollars, even as GM moved towards bankruptcy, and Ford continued 
to fare poorly.</p> 
<p>Whilst there is a widespread impression that Toyota&rsquo;s brilliance 
arises mainly from its revolutionary HR policies, the truth on the ground is 
quite different. At the centre of Toyota&rsquo;s functioning lies the legendary 
Toyota Production System (TPS); the mother of practices like Kanban, Kaizen, 
Jidoka, and Shojinka, familiar members of the global management lexicon. All 
other functions, among them marketing, purchasing, finance, and HR, derive 
their purpose from the demands of production (and the TPS), which is the centre 
of the Toyota universe. Purchasing techniques like Just-in-Time and 
Zero-inventory, for example, dovetail with the needs of the TPS. Similarly HRM 
practices work towards promoting the four goals of employee integration with 
the organisation; employee commitment; workforce flexibility and adaptability; 
and, finally, an emphasis on quality.</p> 
<p>Even though Toyota follows the widespread Japanese traditions of uniforms, 
common parking plots, common canteens and equal treatment of all workers, there 
is a clear demarcation between managers and workers. Hierarchical levels, even 
though they are far lesser than at Ford are clear, and responsibilities of all 
parties spelled out clearly. The HR formula at Toyota is simple and clear; hire 
the right people, pay them well, take good care of them, and develop them to 
work in sync with Toyota&rsquo;s needs. Whilst, the HR policy is easily 
articulated and extremely simple to understand, its ramifications are complex. 
The requirements for people are clearly laid down on company websites and the 
global size of the company has led to substantial local requirement, not just 
of workers, but also of managers. The company is a preferred employer; recent 
advertisements for 700 people for a newly opened truck manufacturing unit drew 
more than 40,000 applications.</p> 
<p>The company offers good salary structures and benefits include pension 
schemes, hospitalisation, disability and life insurance, bonuses, meal 
vouchers, holidays, relocation support and car rental programme. Trade Union 
influence at Toyota is significantly lesser than at Ford. Much of this is due 
to the greater stability of the Trade Unions in Japan than in the US and the 
UK, as also to their consolidation in recent years into the Rengo; the 
remuneration structure, which is based on seniority and not directly related to 
job type also helps in facilitating mobility within the organisation, as well 
as retraining and redeployment and transfers, thus making layoffs unnecessary. 
Union problems are however not completely absent. The Toyota plant in India was 
shut for 14 days in 2006 because of labour violence over union demands for 
reinstatement of a few dismissed employees.</p> 
<p>Toyota has extensive international operations, which makes it necessary for 
its management to adapt to a range of cultural, economic, and political 
situations. Whilst shop floor employees are by and large chosen from local 
people, managerial employees are more international in their constitution, 
especially in western countries. There are significant numbers of American and 
British managers in Toyota facilities in the US and UK, some of whom are also 
sent for long periods to Japan to contribute towards the company&rsquo;s 
international strategy.</p> 
<p>The most significant features of Toyota HRM practices however lie in the 
company&rsquo;s employee training and development policies, which the company 
has maintained with single minded purpose, even as it has expanded into a vast 
international group, employing 200,000 workers at 27 overseas locations. It is 
this belief in employee empowerment that forms the core of Toyota&rsquo;s 
quality control processes, evidenced famously by the authority of shop floor 
employees to stop factory lines when they spot defects. Staff development 
processes are based upon systemically involving employees in details of 
production processes, encouraging work rotation, calling for suggestions, 
facilitating the development of a thoughtful approach, and pushing for the 
inculcation of Kaizen, the philosophy of continuous improvement in working and 
personal life.</p> 
<p>This continuous aim to improve in a myriad ways, in every department, 
process and activity, as a systemic and ingrained approach is closely related 
to the environment of learning that pervades the organisation. Matthew May, in 
an article in the Wharton Leadership Digest makes a similar point from a 
different perspective. At Toyota, he emphasizes, the company has a singular, 
differentiating organizational talent,</p> 
<p>(It&rsquo;s) &ldquo;Learnership&rdquo; Learnership at Toyota is not 
separate from the work; it<em>is</em> the work. By continuously experimenting 
with how to perform your tasks better, or more creatively or more efficiently, 
you constantly raise the bar, turning ideas into action &ndash; action that 
creates meaningful change. And that&rsquo;s what leaders do.</p> 
<h3>Conclusion</h3> 
<h3><em>Summary</em></h3> 
<p>A broad summarisation of HRM policies at Ford and Toyota leads to the 
following conclusions</p> 
<ul> 
<li>HRM policies at both Ford and Toyota have evolved over many years. Whereas 
Ford&rsquo;s HRM policies still follow the production model, which works 
towards continuous production, Toyota, which took many of its initial ideas 
from Ford has now developed a HR methodology that primarily aims to empower the 
workforce to be proactive, thoughtful, holistic, multi skilled and focused upon 
continuous improvement. Whilst Ford is making efforts to increase worker 
participation, its inherent bureaucracies and adversarial relationships with 
Trade Unions make this task difficult and complex.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Selection and recruitment policies at Toyota are extremely tough and the 
success rate of fresh applicants is less than 10%. The enormous number of 
applicants for jobs with Toyota makes the selection process, which specifically 
include team building exercises, more difficult. Ford is also very careful 
about the quality of its employees at all levels. However, the ongoing 
downsizing programme in the USA, which includes both managers and workers, has 
effectually led to most of its recruitment efforts occurring in overseas 
locations, where local constraints play a part in the recruitment process.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Remuneration and benefits for employees are attractive in both Toyota and 
Ford and both companies believe in providing for employees through cash and non 
cash means. Ford is however significantly more constrained in its ability to 
alter compensation or work practices because of the strength of its Trade 
Unions. Employees in Toyota are nurtured to make their careers with Toyota. In 
Ford, whilst the commitment between management and employees is lesser, strong 
Trade Union agreements make it difficult to terminate workers at will.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Trade Unions play a far more dominant role in Ford than in Toyota, 
especially in its Japanese factories. Whilst Toyota insists on a &ldquo;one 
recognised union&rdquo; its expansion into a number of foreign locations in the 
last ten years has necessitated it having to adjust to different labour laws.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>HRM practices in Toyota are geared towards employee empowerment, which 
takes place through systemic processes for constant increase in knowledge, job 
skills, familiarity with other work, as well as for fostering enquiry, 
scepticism, and participation. Whilst Ford initiated programmes for greater 
participation in the 1980s, they are not systemic in nature like those of 
Toyota and are thus unable to achieve fundamental culture changes.</li> </ul> 
<h3><em>British Expatriates in Japan</em></h3> 
<p>In conclusion, UK expatriates planning to work in the automobile industry 
in Japan, need to keep in mind that the work culture and management practices 
in Japan are significantly different than those observed in Britain.</p> 
<p>It is of course essential to develop fluency in Japanese as working will 
essentially entail substantial participatory activity with many Japanese 
managers and workers, many of whom may not be fluent in English.</p> 
<p>Working practices will be far less hierarchical, not only through symbolic 
representations like common uniforms, parking lots, and canteens, but also in 
the workplace where organisations will be flatter, activity will be under 
constant scrutiny and discussion, and chances of outside participation will be 
more. The Japanese also work longer hours and time for rest and recreation will 
be significantly lesser than what is available in the UK. The period spent in 
Japan will however provide high quality experience in advanced manufacturing 
and organisational methods and open up an entirely new vista of learning. 
Expatriates should expect it to be a great learning experience and prepare 
accordingly.</p>
