<strong>Toyota 4Runner
</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2013 Toyota 4Runner: A full redesign for the 2010 model year means the 
4Runner isn't likely to get any significant updates until at least 2012.</li> 
</ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Avalon</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2013 Toyota Avalon: Although it just received a minor refresh for 2011, a 
full redesign of the Toyota Avalon is expected to arrive in late 2012 for the 
2013 model year. Rumor has it that it will adopt some of the sleeker Lexus 
design lines but will retain the 3.5-liter V6 as the powerplant.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Camry</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Camry: A fully redesigned Toyota Camry is arriving in the 
second half of 2011. Given that the Camry recently received new four-cylinder 
engine and six-speed transmissions, the 2012 model will likely focus on revised 
styling and an updated interior.Spy shots, a small official photo preview, and a
viral video which revealed the hybrid have all surfaced as of late.</li> </ul> 
<br> <strong>Toyota Corolla</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2014 Toyota Corolla: A full redesign of the Corolla is due sometime in 
late 2013.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Highlander</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2014 Toyota Highlander: A full redesign of the Toyota Highlander should 
arrive sometime in 2013.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Land Cruiser</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Land Cruiser: Look for a mild refresh of the Land Cruiser in 
late 2011. Last redesigned for the 2008 model year, the Land Cruiser typically 
stretches its lifecycle updates out over a longer period than most Toyota 
models.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Matrix</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2014 Toyota Matrix: Not much is known of the fate of the Toyota Matrix. If 
Toyota deems that a redesign is in order, expect it to appear around the 2014 
Model Year.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Prius</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2013 Toyota Prius: All-new for 2010, the Prius probably won't get any 
major upgrades until its midcycle refresh arrives in 2012.</li> <br>

<li>2013 Toyota Prius-C: The Prius-C is a compact version of the Prius that's 
closer in size to the company's Yaris hatchback. It's expected to arrive in 
2012.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Prius PHV: This plug-in version of the Prius is currently 
being tested in various markets around the world. Full production is expected 
to start sometime in 2011 for the 2012 model year.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>
Toyota RAV4</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota RAV4: Last refreshed for the 2009 model year, the Toyota RAV4 
is expected to get a full redesign in late 2011.</li> <br>

<li>2012 Toyota RAV4 EV: Toyota is gearing up to sell an all-electric variant 
of their RAV4 SUV. This comes as a result from theirjoint venture with Tesla 
and should hit dealerships early next year.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota 
Sequoia</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Sequoia: Although the current Sequoia was redesigned for 2008, 
there was no official 2009 model and the 2010 model received a new engine. With 
that in mind, a substantial midcycle refresh is not expected until the 2012 
model year.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Sienna</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2014 Toyota Sienna: Recently redesigned for 2011, the Sienna probably 
won't receive any significant upgrades until the 2014 model year.</li> </ul> 
<br> <strong>Toyota Tacoma</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Tacoma: Look for a full redesign of Toyota's compact truck for 
the 2012 model year.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Tundra</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2013 Toyota Tundra: After a mild refresh for the 2010 model year, the 
Tundra pickup isn't likely to see any major upgrades until the 2013 model year 
at the earliest.</li> </ul> <br>
<strong>Toyota Venza</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Venza: An all-new vehicle for 2009, the Toyota Venza should 
get a midcycle refresh for the 2012 model year.</li> </ul> <br>

Yaris</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>2012 Toyota Yaris: A full redesign of the Toyota Yaris is expected to 
arrive in 2011. In addition to a new exterior design, the next-generation Yaris 
may also feature a dedicated hybrid model.</li> </ul>

<p>Simply send in america all the Verso variant of all the toyota line 
avalaible in europe . All those get a more clever space efficient interior 
design . The only choice in north american market is the poor designed Matrix .

<p>Well since it's 2012 and there does not seem to be a full Tacoma redesign 
rolling around, perhaps this info is a bit outdated. Anyone hear the real story 
on when the redesign is going to happen?</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Hi TOYOTA,&nbsp;&nbsp;you and all other brands in this country are not 
bringing a turbo diesel (small or midsize) out ! The sales volume of this high 
mpg truck would be off the charts. Make it tough,125,000 mile warranty and oh 
don't forget to listen to your customers and &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; who 
for years have told you that you need to bring in a design consulting firm to 
help you design some good comfortable seats with plenty of adjustments 
!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The new Colorado&nbsp;&nbsp;with 2 duramax diesel options 
most likely will&nbsp;&nbsp;not be setup&nbsp;&nbsp;here&nbsp;&nbsp;with diesel 
and the VW AMAROK TDI is not coming in, so as &quot;NIKE&quot; would say, JUST 
DO IT !! OWN the market !</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Couldnt disagree more on the hilux inspired comments at least from a design 
perspective. I get the desire for a smaller truck mated to a six speed. I also 
would love a turbo diesel option for better mileage. But I love the look of my 
2011 double cab Tacoma. The long bed makes it as functionual as a full size but 
I can still park it in the garage in the winter. The Hilux I saw on the 
Australian site looks like someone married a Venza front end with a Subaru Brat 
rear, no thanks.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Please ditch the Tundra and Sequoia. It's just a plain oversized gas 
guzzling trucks. Why not also ditch the Tacoma and bring in the Hilux instead. 
Have the D4-D's available here such as the 1KD-FTV, 2KD-FTV, and the mighty 
1VD-FTV for the Land Cruiser 200 series. Also bring the LC 76' series just like 
the one's in Australia. I would be the first one to buy a LC 76' Wagon GXL, 
1VD-FTV, Front &amp; Rear Solid Axles, Manual Front Locking Hubs, Manual 
Transmission, V8 Twin-Turbo Diesel. I envy what comes to Australia and not here 
(Yes go to Toyota Australia's website and look up the specs on the LC 76', no 
other SUV will come close and ridgid to that). Also don't forget the Prado for 
the complete line up of real diesel ridgid body-on-frame construction SUV's. 
Wow keep on dreaming :'(</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Hi there Toyota Corporate, I'm very interested in your 2012 FJ Cruiser. The 
problem I'm having is the bad gas mileage, your FJ current design gets. 16 
Town/20 HWY that SUCKS!<br>
<br>
First, as your aware gas prices are climbing 
($4.00+) and will probably will keep going up. I have done some research and 
found that Toyota makes a really efficient clean burning diesel engine for 
Thailand and Europe. The reference for that engine is a D4-D, 1KD-FTV, it is a 
3.0 (Turbo Charged 2982 cc) offered in the new 60 year anniversary model 2011 
Land Cruiser, only being marketed in Europe. The performance specs you can look 
up but I think they came out with the original engine in 2006 but it has been 
updated this year (2011). The point being, that with very little effort Toyota 
could produce a 2012 or 2013 vastly improved Diesel FJ that could run in the 25 
city/35 Hwy MPG range and offer an improved torque range, over the current 
version, to the outdoors enthusiasts with realistic and substantial every day 
fuel savings. I think the latest version of the D4D Diesel motor meets the Euro 
5 emission standards and produces 190 HP with 420 Nm Torque. The new 
particulate filter system (updated 2011 version) works wonderfully on the 2011 
Toyota Land Cruiser. If you wanted to bump-up performance you could easily do 
it by adding a 3&quot; exhaust system to the D4-D Diesel and t-week your chip 
controlled fuel/air chip settings. This would work so wonderfully for a New 
2012 Diesel FJ and improve the FJ's performance and popularity over night. If 
your still uncertain, you could offer it as a special order and see what the 
demand is. My thoughts are that the American and Australian markets would suck 
them up like a hoover vacuum. Toyota couldn't keep up with the demand in either 
market.<br>
<br>
Second, issue is the transmission/transfer case set-up. The FJ 
6MT transmission is desirable due to the full time or All Wheel Drive (AWD) 
feature. Why can't Toyota offer the Auto Transmission folks a AWD with 3 gear 
ranges? If it had a standard high range (H), a low range (L) and a extra-low 
(LL) range setting, it would be so excellent! This would be a major selling 
point. Seems Toyota did offer an automatic AWD with a high and low range in the 
new 2011 Toyota Land Cruiser. Also the Toyota Highlander comes in AWD. Seems in 
the off road environment moving through bad terra-forma, crawling over rocks, 
or any 4 wheeling situation would be vastly improved if the AWD system had 3 
ranges to work with. AWD Diesel FJ would be way more popular than a standard 4 
wheel drive model, the not getting stuck because the 4 wheel drive (2 drive 
tires) can't get traction, would be a wonderful advantage. Good mileage and in 
unstoppable AWD in 3 gear ranges. WOW! That would be a mega selling point don't 
you think? I sure think so. AWD in an automatic transmission FJ Diesel that 
gets 25/35MPG would make me go buy one today.<br>
<br>
Third, I think changing 
the tires and wheels would help with the ground clearance problem. Also lifting 
the body such that the front (3 inches) and rear (2 inches) so the vehicle is 
level, would be good. It would give better overall handling and a better 
appearance. The setup I would pick is the 18 inch Toyota FJ Cruiser Trail Teams 
Special Edition BLACK KMC XD Series ROCKSTAR Rims, and the BFGoodrich 
Mud-Terrain T/A KM 2 tires size 37X12.50R18( 939x317, 37.0x12.5 ) 123Q.<br>
<br>
Fourth, is the driver and passenger front seats. They aren't very comfortable. 
Can you provide an improved adjustable seat? (Look at the 2011 VW TDI Jetta for 
ideas (if necessary), they did a good job and have a interesting height 
adjustment system.) Especially for the lumbar support, and having a height 
adjustment would be excellent. Or at least incorporating a seat that gives 
better protection to the driver on ruff roads. I'm 6'-4&quot; and I have long 
legs, so I find the seats in the FJ's to be a disappointment and extremely 
uncomfortable. Just some minor changes would improve it so much!<br>
<br>

Fifth, could you suggest bringing the New 2012 /2013 Diesel FJ's out in the 
Bright Red color or Bright Emerald Green. The Voodoo Blue was very nice, eye 
catching. Keeping the Voodoo Blue available as a color choice on future FJ's 
would be wonderful too. The Brick Red color sucks! The orange cone yellow 
sucked. Army Green was fair. Bright Yellow was good. The Carvery Blue was fair. 
Overall dull, drably colors on vehicles that cost 25-30K won't be very popular. 
Step up the game a little, you think? I think so. The Voodoo Blue ones always 
catch my eye and primarily drew my interest to the FJ design.<br>
<br>
If 
Toyota wanted to improve the size of the SUV market they have here in the USA, 
just these few changes would do that. If you could make your product cost less 
than your competitors, while still offering more standardized features, like 
these noted above, that would also create momentum in the market in your favor. 
Why can't Toyota be the first to do the USA a solid, and provide a 2012/2013 
Diesel FJ that gets 25 city/35 HWY MPG for the outdoors man. Offering a Diesel 
FJ for the same price as the Gas Motor FJ, would also be very cool. Also the 
Cold Weather Plugin for the Oil Pan/Water Heater and Tow Package with the 
Square Hitch having both a circle plug (Electric Brake with a brake controller 
system integrated into the FJ Dash) and the Std Square Plug should both be on 
the vehicle and be included as standard equipment. Outdoor folks tow boats, 
snow machines, campers, trailers and other items. If Ford can do it on their 
F150 4X4's I know Toyota can do it too.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Would love to see a Tacoma TRD Off Road with a diesel here in the states. 
It irratates me to no end to see compact 4x4 trucks with diesel available every 
else except here! Thanks EPA. Toyota there is a demand for a torquey 
diesel&nbsp;&nbsp;motor with somewhere around 30 mpg +.</p> Report ItReport It

<p>04:30 AM, 12/10/2010</p> 
<p>I prefer to base my comments on personal experiences rather than repeat the 
same old fanboy club statements. I've purchased 21 new vehicles for personal 
use since I began driving and a few used ones for my kids. My personal 
experience has always been that Toyota vehicles are built better and last 
longer than comparable domestics. I've had great luck with Honda and Nissan as 
well. I will never again be duped into buying a Ford. Sorry, ain't going to 
happen. It may be in vogue right now to talk up Ford, but when I compare my 
Ford experiences with Toyota experiences, Toyota comes out on top. My 2002 
Toyota Tacoma has 398,000 km on it and it has been the best vehicle I have ever 
owned. Brakes, tires, oil changes, a couple tune ups and one repair on the 
oxygen sensor on the exhaust (simple cheap fix) and that's it. Burns no oil, 
runs like new. Original equipment with the exception of what I stated. My 
daughter's new Toyota Matrix is a fantastic vehicle. We looked and shopped 
around at other dealers and the Matrix was by far the best. My wife's 4Runner 
offers what no other manufacturer can provide; rugged good looks, sterling 
quality and dependability and fantastic resale. This family are happy Toyota 
owners and by the way do not work for or with Toyota.</p> Report ItReport It
