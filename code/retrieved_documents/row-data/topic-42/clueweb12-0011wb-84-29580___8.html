 As About.com&rsquo;s Guide to 
Motorcycles, I spend a lot of time in the saddle across a wide range of bikes 
ranging from crotch rockets to dirt bikes. But while sampling Honda&rsquo;s 
latest motocross offerings, it was the perfect opportunity to also test a 
pickup truck&rsquo;s ability to haul them.
<p> Enter the Toyota Tacoma 4X4 Double Cab, a truck whose reputation as a 
workhorse precedes itself. How does this pickup handle everything from 
day-to-day driving to bike hauling? I drove a Tacoma nearly 1,000 miles in one 
week to find out.</p> 
<h3>FIRST GLANCE: 208 INCHES AND 4,155 POUNDS OF TRUCK</h3>  Toyota&rsquo;s 
bulletproof4.0 liter V6 powers the entire 5-passenger Tacoma Double Cab lineup, 
and our test truck&rsquo;s engine was mated to a 5-speed automatic 
transmission. The V6 puts out 236 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 266 lb-ft of 
torque at 4,000 rpm, and is rated at 16 mpg city, 20 mpg highway. The part-time 
4X4 system can be switched using adial on the dash. Coil spring double wishbone 
suspension components are found up front, while a leaf spring setup with 
outboard-mounted shocks are setup at the rear. The truck&rsquo;s four-wheel ABS 
brakes utilize discs at the front wheels, and drums at the rear.
<p> Our tester was equipped with a $3,030 SR5 Extra Value Package, which 
boasts a load of options including a JBL XM SatelliteAudio and Bluetooth system 
with six speakers and a subwoofer, a chrome grille surround, a sliding rear 
window with privacy glass, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio 
controls and remote keyless entry&mdash;among other goodies. A $650 Tow Package 
adds a class 4 hitch, supplemental transmission oil coolers, a heavy duty 
battery and 130-amp alternator, and a 7-pin connector, bringing our test 
car&rsquo;s grand total to $30,605.</p> 
<p> The Double Cab 4X4 measures 208.1 inches from bumper to 
bumper&mdash;that&rsquo;s a whopping 17 feet, 4.1 inches&mdash;and its curb 
weight tips the scales at 4,155 lbs. The Tacoma Double Cab receives five stars 
in NHTSA front and side crash testing, and four stars in the rollover test.</p>

<h3>THE DRIVER&rsquo;S SEAT: A CAMRY ON STILTS?</h3>

Basem Wasef,About.com Guide to Motorcycles <br>
 Climb aboard the Tacoma Double 
Cab, and you&rsquo;ll be sitting high in a cabin that&rsquo;s tastefully 
appointed in cloth. The interior feels somewhat like a Camry on stilts, though 
a few plasticky bits (like some of the dash surfaces and thecupholder-equipped 
door panels) keep the Tacoma from feeling altogether luxurious. 
<p> The gauges are clear and no-nonsense, and a rear-view camera insert on the 
mirror makes it easy to back up with confidence (though the view is strictly 
pavement when cargo is loaded and the liftgate is flipped down.) The narrowest 
distance between the wheel wells (41.5 inches) leaves enough room for two 
dirtbikes to be loaded up side-by-side, and sliding mounting hooks allow 
tie-downs to be repositioned.</p> 
<p> Handy storage compartments include a large center console between the 
front seats and flip-up rear seats, which lift to revealnifty cargo nooks. The 
sliding rear window with privacy glass makes it easy for passengers to reach 
back into the bed (or for a cool breeze to be diverted into the truck,) and the 
Tacoma&rsquo;s large exterior proportions translate to a commanding view of the 
road from inside, where the cabin&rsquo;s user-friendly vibe offers a pleasant 
contrast to the truck&rsquo;s outward appearance of utility.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>ON THE ROAD IN THE 4X4 TACOMA TRUCK</h3>  Despite its high altitude cabin, 
the Tacoma feels somewhat car-like&mdash;especially considering its chassis 
uses frame-on-body (as opposed to unibody) construction. Power steering boost 
is high and the cabin feels quiet at speed, and there&rsquo;s adequate thrust 
from the V6 to propel this dual cab beast to high velocities rather handily.
<p> The five-speed transmission shifts smoothly, though the ride isn&rsquo;t 
quite as seamless as the gearbox. Though Tacoma handles securely, this truck 
can get rather jouncy when the pavement is anything but glassy smooth. Try 
drinking a cup of coffee on LA freeways like I did, and there&rsquo;s a strong 
chance you&rsquo;ll end up wearing your drink on your shirt. In fact, on the 
most severely uneven road surfaces, the ride is so busy that it&rsquo;s hard to 
speak a sentence without sounding like you&rsquo;re getting a karate chop-style 
shiatsu massage.</p> 
<p> But at higher speeds (like I encountered when driving from LA to 
dirtbike-friendly Trona Pinnacles, just outside Death Valley), the Tacoma 
proves hushed and comfortable, and the JBL sound system produces full sound 
that&rsquo;s a great antidote to the doldrums of long distance driving. It may 
feel bulky under most city circumstances, but the Tacoma shines on longer 
excursions with its well-insulated cabin that offers a commanding view of the 
road.</p>

<h3>JOURNEY&rsquo;S END</h3>

 Toyota has recently taken a beating 
overrust issues involving its Tundra trucks, raising some doubts about the long 
term integrity of their pickup trucks. And while it&rsquo;s almost impossible 
to predict the impact of the current flack over Toyota&rsquo;s quality control 
issues, we can safely report that our time spent with the Double Cab Tacoma 
reminded us of what Toyota does right with its trucks.
<p> Over the course of roughly 1,000 miles, our Tacoma offered equal doses of 
utility and comfort. We used the Tacoma to haul dirtbikes, lug groceries, and 
we even used this full size truck to cruise Sunset Boulevard against a 
background of far more exotic vehicles. If there&rsquo;s a testimony to its 
versatility, it&rsquo;s the fact that this Toyota took care of business without 
breaking a sweat&mdash;a fairly impressive feat that makes the Tacoma Double 
Cab as effective at transporting motorcycles as it is at commuting across town.
