<h3>Video Regarding the Amish Language</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>1 Comment | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>I knew the Amish spoke their own language but Ive never taken the time to 
find out more about it. This short video tells you about the language and how 
kid are taught at school. Pretty Interesting.</p> 
<p>*Edit* I removed the video because it was breaking the sites code. Heres a 
link to the video.</p> 
<p>http://www.spike.com/video/what-is-your-2nd/2885961</p> 
<p>What language do the Amish speak? The Amish speak Dutch or Pennsylvania 
Dutch which is a dialect of German. Im sure since theyve been isolated for near 
200 years now that the language has evolved in to a creole of sorts.</p>

<p>I found these videos on childhood foreign language learning. Let me know 
what you think.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Although it seems that the teacher isnt extremely fluent herself it is good 
to see a school district placing priority on foreign language learning for 
young students. As long as the school maintains foreign language education 
throughout the students school life they should graduate with functional 
language skills.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg - StumbleUpon - del.icio.us -

<h3>Improve your Accent and Pronunciation Tempe, AZ</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Our latest language learning tip video teaches you <strong>how to improve 
your accent and pronunciation in a foreign language.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Beginners will not want to focus heavily on these techniques but should 
definitely be aware of them and be using them as they progress. You can also 
use these techniques to simply build speaking fluency. A large part of speaking 
fluency is recall and muscle memory. You may have the words but stumble when it 
is time to speak because you have not developed the muscle memory or habit.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Alphabet and Compound Sounds</strong> &ndash; Make sure that you 
know all of the alphabets individual and compound sounds so that you can say 
them without thinking. It needs to become second nature.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Go Slow </strong>- When you practice take your time and sound 
out each syllable. I know natives dont always pronounce each syllable but learn 
it correctly first and then you can adjust later. Your speaking abilities will 
sound more polished and natural. When you do start to drop syllables or to 
speak quickly like a native you will sounds even better.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Be a Copy Cat</strong> &ndash; I know that your mom told you 
that it isnt nice to be a copy cat but when learning a foreign language it 
pays. Pick a subject and study them. Imitate everything they say and how they 
say. Choose someone whos accent and pronunciation you enjoy and do your best to 
speak like them.</p>

<h3>Convenient Language Learning in Tempe, AZ</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Heres a language learning tip that is a personal favorite. Leave a comment 
or subscribe to our blog and let us know what you think or what has worked for 
you.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A brief synopsis of the video:</p> 
<p>Making language studies convenient and easy is very important. It is 
important for 2 reasons.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>When the going gets tough</strong> &ndash; When language 
learning becomes difficult or a chore students often give up or move on.<br>
 2.
<strong>Natural is better </strong>- Language learning is more natural when it 
is extemporaneous and in the moment.</p> 
<p>How to make language learning more convenient:</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Plan ahead</strong> &ndash; Make sure that you think ahead about 
how you can make your language studies more natural. For example if you are in 
the car and you have satellite radio tune into one of the foreign language 
stations. Watch the news in Spanish. Make daily activities that you would do 
normally into language learning opportunities.<br>
 2. <strong>Use Convenient 
Tools</strong> &ndash; Make sure that you have the tools necessary to help you 
make language learning convenient. A small notepad always at the ready. A very 
small pocket dictionary. Foreign language music or podcasts on your ipod.</p>

<h3>Essential Books for Language Study</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Most people who are studying foreign languages will have a whole library of 
books about their language of interest. However, there a few that you just cant 
do without. I show books for different languages but you can find the books I 
show in almost any language easily with the exception of my extremely small 
French only dictionary.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>List of Books:<br>
<strong><br>
 1. 501 verb books: </strong> When I was 
learning French I chose the 6 most common conjugations and learned the 
different verb types. Er, Ir, Oir.. I started by writing them hundreds of times 
each until I could recite them without thinking. Then I progressed to reciting 
them by memory. Next I created sentences and used all of the conjugations for 
each pronoun in each tense until is was second nature.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Standard Dictionary:</strong> Although there are lots of 
dictionaries out there very few do it well. Look for a dictionary with precise, 
up to date and adequate definitions. It also helps if they have examples of how 
the word is used contextually or idiomatically.<br>
<strong><br>
 3. Theme 
Based Dictionaries:</strong> I personally really like Mastering Language 
Vocabulary by Barrons but Im sure there are others that are very good. The 
books gives you a lot of vocabulary words that are important in certain 
subjects but you may have not have thought of because they are more idiomatic 
or technical words that are uncommon.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Uber Tiny Pocket Dictionary:</strong> I found this dictionary 
while living in France and fell in love. I literally carried it with me 
everywhere I went for 1.5 years. At anytime I wanted to find out what a word 
meant that someone said in a conversation or while reading I instantly looked 
it up. This dictionary is French only so I only started using it after I was 
conversational. However, it is the most important book in my collection because 
it makes language learning convenient and immediate. Often times youll think of 
a word and then forget it because by the time you get home and can look it up 
youve completely forgot.</p> 
<p>I hope this helps you get started learning your desired foreign language or 
improves your current studies.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg - StumbleUpon -

<h3>Kids vs Adults learning a foreign language</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Im not one who believes that people are limited. I dont think that we have 
supernatural powers but at the same time feel that what holds many back are our 
own minds. Fear, Doubt, Apprehension, Suspicion, Laziness and Preconceived 
notions about how something is. I think that language learning is the same way.
</p> 
<p>I often get asked by adult students if it is too late for them to learn a 
foreign language. My response is always that anyone can learn a foreign 
language. You may learn faster or slower than the next but if you work hard you 
will learn the language.</p> 
<p>Adults are no different than kids in our ability to learn except that we 
have this intellectual or emotional baggage that tells that we cant do 
something or that it is too difficult and not worth trying. Kids just do it 
because it is part of their life.</p> 
<p>Ive been thought about this for a long time and these are just some of my 
personal rantings about Kids vs Adults in language learning. Heres the blog 
post that reignited this subject for me.</p> 
<p>Im not sure that it is an easier for younger children to learn a foreign 
language but it does seem that the end result is a more fluid and natural 
speaker of the 2nd language. Adults can achieve the same results but it takes 
time and hard work. Work that kids just saw as part of life and occured 
naturally for them in their daily activities.</p> 
<p>I think that part of the reason that we think that kids learn easier is 
because they dont remember how hard it was because it was just part of life. Do 
you ever think about 2nd grade and say history, math or English class was hard? 
Probably not.</p> 
<p>As adults we build up language learning too much in our minds as something 
hard or think it will be easy and then get discouraged when we dont speak 
fluently in 30 days.</p> 
<p>It takes kids 7-8 years before they speak their native language extremely 
well. Even then they will be learning it for another 8-10 years depending on 
their education. Adults learning a foreign language think it is hard because 
they are more conscious of the effort they are exerting in order to gain this 
new skill and knowledge. Additionally, adults have become accustomed to 
learning new thing quickly with their increase intelligence and experience.</p> 
<p>Language has a humbling effect and probably takes the same amount of time 
to learn as an adult as it does as a child. So do I think that it is easier for 
kids to learn a foreign language than adults. NO! Adults are just more aware of 
all of the hard work it takes to learn a language.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg
