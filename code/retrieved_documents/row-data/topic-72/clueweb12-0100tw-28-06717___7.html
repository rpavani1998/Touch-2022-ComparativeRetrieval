<p>Guitar Zero author, Gary Marcus.</p> 
<p>Last weekend as I was doing some Saturday morning chores around the house I 
found NPR on the ipod and it was like spending time with an old friend.&nbsp; 
Living in Turkey, I have forgone some of my favorite programs like<em>A Prairie 
Home Companion</em> and <em>This American Life</em>.&nbsp; Occasionally though 
I&rsquo;ll find<em>Morning Edition</em> or <em>All Things Considered</em> on 
the NPR website to get a little update on the state of the news in the 
States.&nbsp; Today in fact I discovered that there is a presidential election 
coming up this fall! &ndash; just kidding, I&rsquo;m not that out of 
touch.&nbsp; I actually listened to Science Friday as I scrubbed toilets and 
washed dishes and was excited to hear an interview with Gary Marcus, the author 
of<em>Guitar Zero: The New Musician and the Science of Learning</em>.</p> 
<p>Marcus is a professor of psychology at New York University and studied 
language acquisition as a graduate student.&nbsp; The premise of the book is 
his quest to learn guitar as a nearly 40 year old adult and his documentation 
and research of the process.&nbsp; Professor Marcus was interested in learning 
about how we learn as adults and as I listened I realized that there were loads 
of connections between what he was saying and language learning.</p> 
<p><strong>Here is how the book begins:</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Are musicians born or made? All my life I wanted to become musical, but I 
always assumed that I never had a chance. My ears are dodgy, my fingers too 
clumsy. I have no natural sense of rhythm and a lousy sense of pitch. I have 
always loved music but could never sing, let alone play an instrument; in 
school I came to believe that I was destined to be a spectator, rather than a 
participant, no matter how hard I tried.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It seems a fitting way to begin looking at Guitar Zero because I so often 
hear people talk about not having a &lsquo;natural talent&rsquo; or not being 
&lsquo;good&rsquo; at learning languages.&nbsp; They may never have read about 
the &lsquo;critical period hypothesis&rsquo; but somehow they have come to 
believe it.&nbsp; And so while Professor Marcus uses language learning as a 
springboard for discussing learning to play guitar as an adult, I&rsquo;d like 
to try to extrapolate back to language learning some of the comments he made in 
the interview on<em>Science Friday</em>.</p> 
<p>I have only just begun to read the book and so I want to comment on a few 
of the things said in the interview and see what applications we can make from 
them as everyday language learners.&nbsp; (click here to listen to the NPR 
interview)</p> 
<p>One main theme discussed in the interview is this idea that kids somehow 
have a greater ability to learn new things than adults, that a certain point 
comes around puberty where the human brains sort of locks up and new learning 
becomes more difficult if not impossible.&nbsp; In second language acquisition 
theory this is known as the critical period hypothesis.&nbsp; Marcus points out 
that this theory&rsquo;s argument is getting weaker and weaker as more and more 
research is done.&nbsp; He does point out two factors that make it seem like 
kids do better.&nbsp; But of course these aren&rsquo;t related to any sort of 
critical period, but rather to kids being kids and adults, unfortunately, being 
adults.</p> 
<h2>Patience</h2> 
<p>Kids seem unfazed watching the same <em>Barney</em> cartoon a hundred 
times.&nbsp; Give a kid and instrument and they will patiently play it for 
hours with no real concern that they are unable to play a tune yet.&nbsp; This 
allows kids more repetition than adults who have little patience to stick with 
something in which an immediate sense of accomplishment is lacking.</p> 
<p>I often encourage language learners to listen, watch or read the same 
stories repeatedly.&nbsp; Many find this a difficult task.&nbsp; To learners 
driven by ideas of productivity and outcomes, watching the same movie twice can 
seem a maddening idea.</p> 
<h2>Inhibition</h2> 
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t care if they sound bad. They 
don&rsquo;t care if they can&rsquo;t keep a beat.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t care 
what others think because they haven&rsquo;t yet figured out that what others 
think is somehow important.&nbsp; And so kids just let it go, they have fun, 
they make noise and speak jibberish.&nbsp; If you are reading this though, you 
are probably an adult who understands intimately the feeling of fear or 
embarrassment that prevents you from speaking or stepping up to the mic or 
picking up your guitar to play for a group even though you are still learning.
</p> 
<p>I was once told to &ldquo;get used to the idea that you are going to be the 
town clown&rdquo; as a beginning language learner.&nbsp; In myfree guide to 
motivation and commitment I encourage language learners to &ldquo;check their 
ego at the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our inhibitions only slow our progress down.</p> 
<h2>Time, Effectiveness and Talent</h2> 
<p>Professor Marcus discusses several other ideas in between the stories and 
examples he shares during the course of the interview.&nbsp; He also parses out 
some great advice for adults who want to begin to learn something new.</p> 
<p>Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s idea of the 10,000 hour rule comes up and Marcus 
agrees with the assessment that to truly master a complex skill, 10,000 hours 
seems to be a close equivalent to the time needed to really become great at 
something. He does add a few important additions though.&nbsp; First, skills 
are different.&nbsp; Learning to play the guitar might require more hours to 
master than learning to play the bongo drum.&nbsp; Learning to speak a new 
language will take more time to master than learning to paint a house.&nbsp; 
But time &ndash; and lots of it &ndash; is a requirement for anyone to learn 
anything well.</p> 
<p>He does add as well that the kind of practice we put in is important.&nbsp; 
Those who progress fastest and furthest seem to continually target their 
weaknesses while maintaining their strengths and finding the most effective 
strategies for learning.</p> 
<p>And finally he adds that natural talent does exist &ndash; that is, some 
people are born with a special talent for a certain skill.&nbsp; Bach was a 
world class musician because he put in the time, but also because he did have 
some natural talent beyond what most of us have.&nbsp; In language learning 
too, some may have a natural talent that makes learning a language seem 
easy.&nbsp; But Marcus&rsquo; point in this is to point out that none of us is 
born with an inability to learn and develop a certain skill.&nbsp; Everyone is 
born with the ability to learn another language &ndash; in that sense we are 
all the same.&nbsp; Some few just have a little extra in the language learning 
department.&nbsp; But as adults, we also have cognitive abilities to figure 
things out that kids don&rsquo;t have yet.</p> 
<h2>Guitar Zero Words of Advice</h2> 
<p>As I listened to Gary tell the stories of his journey and share the 
research, he also came to the point of sharing a few words of advice with those 
who called in and to the general audience as well.&nbsp; His advice was focused 
at adults wanting to get started learning to play music, but it seems good 
advice as well for language learners.&nbsp; A few specific words of advice were:
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t expect overnight success.</li> 
<li>Target your weaknesses.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to switch teachers if it&rsquo;s not working for you.
</li> 
<li>Focus on good technique.</li> </ol> 
<p>I look forward to reading the book in the next few weeks and hope to pull 
more lessons for everyday language learners from its contents. For now, 
I&rsquo;ll leave you with the above and hope that there is some encouragement 
to be found in knowing that we adults have all the necessary ability to learn 
another language and to learn it well.</p> 
<p><strong>If any of you have read <em>Guitar Zero</em>, I&rsquo;d love to 
hear your thoughts and other lessons that we as language learners can learn 
from it.</strong></p>
