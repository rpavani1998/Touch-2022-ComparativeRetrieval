<h2>The portable brain (planners and task&nbsp;management)</h2> September 12, 
2010 Aimee Yermish 14 comments <br>

<p>Okay, I promised some ideas on planners and how to keep track of 
assignments. &nbsp;This got a lot longer than I thought it would&hellip; there 
is a lot of complexity!</p> 
<p>As I feared, Little Bird&rsquo;s middle school has handed out Their 
Official Agenda Book that they plan to Periodically Check that the kids are 
using the way they have decided is the One Right Way. &nbsp;Given that the 
notebook system they&rsquo;ve chosen is even worse than I&rsquo;d feared (I 
might even need to do another rant!), let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m a bit 
skeptical. Sigh.</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t say as I&rsquo;ve found a bulletproof system for keeping 
track of tasks (what&nbsp;needs to be done)&nbsp;and time (when&nbsp;it will be 
done and when it will be completed), but let me at least raise the issues I 
think need to be considered in the process.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Simplify, simplify. </em></strong>As with the&nbsp;
paper-management system, I advise keeping things as simple as possible. 
&nbsp;The goal is to have&nbsp;<em>one</em> object that handles <em>all</em> of 
the task-related information and time-related information in as simple a 
fashion as possible. &nbsp;I lovingly call mine my &ldquo;portable 
brain.&rdquo; &nbsp;If you have two different things, then you&rsquo;re going 
to (a) put information in the wrong place or in only one of the places (b) look 
in the wrong place or in only one of the places and thus miss something you 
need to know.<strong> It needs to be </strong><em><strong>easy</strong></em>
<strong> to put information into and <em>easy</em></strong><strong> to get 
information out of.</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Paper or plastic?</em></strong> Since you only get one object 
to play with, you have to decide whether it&rsquo;s going to be a hardcopy 
paper calendar (like they hand out at school) or whether you&rsquo;re going to 
use an electronic system. &nbsp;Personally, if you can afford to implement it, 
I favor the electronic solutions, because they offer some advantages that are 
hard to duplicate in paper form.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If the writer has bad handwriting or doesn&rsquo;t like to write, typing 
is likely to be more legible, particularly at smaller font sizes, and most 
non-writers don&rsquo;t mind typing as much. &nbsp;Workaround for paper: 
&nbsp;Try preprinting some small stickers with typically-used words (e.g. 
&ldquo;test&rdquo;) and stapling those to the inside cover.</li> 
<li>Remember that being able to write small also contributes to keeping the 
whole object small, too (see below).</li> 
<li>When there are (inevitable) changes in task or time information, they can 
be changed easily without leaving lots of scribbly mess.</li> 
<li>Electronic systems can be set to&nbsp;harass&nbsp;remind you of upcoming 
tasks or deadlines.</li> 
<li>Electronic systems can back up to a main computer or store the information 
in the &ldquo;cloud.&rdquo;</li> 
<li>If there are multiple people within a family who might need to look at, 
add, or change information, electronic systems can be set up to enable this. 
&nbsp;(More on this issue below.)</li> 
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to deal with discontinuities in time. &nbsp;Most 
pre-bound systems that schools hand out and that are &nbsp;easily available in 
stores don&rsquo;t handle this elegantly, and you&rsquo;re stuck copying some 
pages as you make the transition from one year to another.</li> </ul> 
<p>(Note that both paper and electronic systems are likely to be royally 
messed up by laundering, and both can often be restored by various heroic 
means. &nbsp;Choose your poison. &nbsp;I will say, however, that many 
disorganized kids (including everyone in my household old enough to need an 
organizer)&nbsp;<em>do</em> manage to hold onto electronic devices, despite 
everyone&rsquo;s fears, so don&rsquo;t assume that the kid who loses everything 
will also lose their electronic portable brain.)</p> 
<p>If you would like to use a paper system, I&rsquo;d recommend something like 
a&nbsp;DayRunner or Franklin Planner, which allows you to customize sheet types 
and to keep adding new sheets and retiring old sheets as you go. &nbsp;To 
reduce costs, try just aregular half-sheet 3-ring binder, for which you can buy 
refills (check that they&rsquo;re compatible in hole placement!) or 
print/chop/hole-punch your own. &nbsp;(eww, that&rsquo;s starting to sound like 
work&hellip; will you really do it reliably? &nbsp;Or will you procrastinate 
and run off the end of the system?) &nbsp;If what you find doesn&rsquo;t come 
with a zip or other means to close it and protect the pages, try adding an 
elastic strap or rubber band.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Size:</em></strong> You could, I suppose, use 8.5&Prime; x 
11&Prime; sheets, whether purchased or homebrewed, and integrate this right 
into the front of the traveling zip-binder I describe inthis post. However, I 
usually actually prefer the planner to be a separate item that is small enough 
and portable enough to be with you on a constant or near-constant basis. 
&nbsp;For kids in school, that may not be a show-stopper; the times they get 
told things that need to get into the binder usually<em>are</em> the times when 
that zip-binder will be right with them. &nbsp;For us oldsters, or for older 
kids who are homeschooling or who do a lot ofout-of-school activities, the 
smallest item you can get the information into reliably and neatly and can keep 
on your person, without forgetting it&rsquo;s there and laundering it (sigh) is 
probably best, because it facilitates efficient idea capture. &nbsp;Which 
brings me to&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong><em>Capture method:</em></strong> Think your way through a typical 
week. &nbsp;What are the kinds of things you need to write down? &nbsp;Is it 
just homework, or do you have other activities that also create things you have 
to do and pulls on your time? &nbsp;When and under what circumstances do you 
get information, either from other people or from your own head, that needs to 
get recorded in the system? &nbsp;What are the precise kinds of things that 
need to get entered? &nbsp;What might interfere with your getting those<em>exact
</em> things<em> into</em> the system at those <em>exact</em> moments?</p> 
<p>See, I have a Crappy Working Memory &trade;, which means that if I 
don&rsquo;t capture an idea within about ten seconds, it will be gone gone 
gone. &nbsp;Within about thirty seconds, I won&rsquo;t even remember that there
<em>was</em> an idea that I was supposed to remember. &nbsp;So I advise making 
a personal rule: &nbsp;&rdquo;I will not say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write that down 
later.&rsquo;&rdquo; &nbsp;(I know, your kids think they&rsquo;re super and 
will remember. &nbsp;Tell them that it&rsquo;s not an admission of fault or 
imperfection that they develop and use a system so that they don&rsquo;t have 
to waste brain cycles remembering.)</p> 
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t going to have your actual planner ready to hand all the 
time, what<em>will</em> you have with you that will enable you to capture 
information that needs to get into the planner? &nbsp; &nbsp;Some ideas on this 
front:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Email can make a good capture site and a good way for members of a family 
to send each other information, but<em>only</em> if you then also take the oath 
that you will<em>immediately</em> transcribe any information found in your 
inbox into the proper place later, or create a folder (better: one with an 
automatic sort-int0-this-folder rule!) that is<em>only</em> for these 
to-be-captured items, that you then empty<em>regularly</em> (see below). 
&nbsp;Otherwise, your inbox will fill up too fast with stuff that doesn&rsquo;t 
need to be in the capture &nbsp;box and stuff will get lost.</li> 
<li>There is a paid-but-not-expensive service called www.jott.com. &nbsp;You 
basically register a phone and an email. &nbsp;You call their number from the 
phone (they have an iPhone app, too, of course), say your voice memo, and it 
gets transcribed and sent to you in an email. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not perfect, but 
it&rsquo;s nice for situations where writing doesn&rsquo;t work well (like, 
say, if you&rsquo;re driving). &nbsp;Remember, though, that in most situations 
in which you could make a phone call or send an email, if your electronic 
device were also your portable brain, then you wouldn&rsquo;t need to use this.
</li> 
<li>A low-tech concept, particularly useful if your planner system is too 
large to be on your person all the time, is to have an index card jotter 
(here&rsquo;san example) to scribble things in.</li> 
<li>I know this might sound silly, but if your capture system requires a 
writing implement, then you need a writing implement attached to it, so no time 
is wasted searching.</li> </ul> 
<p>But remember that you now have a two-step process. &nbsp;You need to set up 
some kind of regular routine that will remind you to<em>empty</em> that 
capture-box into the actual planner. &nbsp;Think about how often this needs to 
happen in order to be useful (if your deadlines tend to be only a few days 
after you find out about them, then a weekly process is too slow!), and how you 
will make sure that you don&rsquo;t forget to do it. &nbsp;Consider putting a 
repeating appointment on your calendar, or a repeating task on your task-list, 
and setting your system to nag&nbsp;remind you to do it.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Loose slips sink ships. </em></strong>There is a tendency to 
let a handout or flyer or or appointment card email stand in for the event or 
assignment, to hold onto the paper that someone else gave you and to say, 
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll enter that into the system later.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Yeah, 
right.) But if you&rsquo;re not entering it immediately, it needs to actually 
physically be put&nbsp;<em>in</em> the capture inbox, and it must get <em>
emptied</em> into the real system with everything else.</p> 
<p>To avoid the problem, I make it my personal goal to <em>get rid of</em> 
those pieces of paper as soon as possible by entering the relevant information 
into my system. &nbsp;Literally, I say, &ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t give me a 
reminder card, let me just write the appointment down right now.&rdquo; 
(Permission slips and forms, where someone else wants the sheet of paper back, 
are not assignment sheets &mdash; they go into the hot-folder systemin the 
binder, silly!)</p> 
<p><strong><em>Home sweet home.</em> </strong>Whatever you choose, losing it 
will be a time-wasting and anxiety-provoking crisis. &nbsp;So think about the 
routines you create for its movement. &nbsp;Does it need to have a special 
place of honor on your bedside table? &nbsp;A specific pocket in your purse or 
backpack? &nbsp;Do you always wear the same type of jeans (or whatever), such 
that it could always live in your pocket? &nbsp;Just like you need one object, 
it needs to have the fewest possible places where it could be. &nbsp;If you 
ever spot it outside one of those places, it needs to get put back in one of 
its permissible &ldquo;homes&rdquo; right away.</p> 
<p><strong><em>A family affair</em>. &nbsp;Organizing tasks and time is a 
lifelong skill. &nbsp;Everyone in the family needs to model the skills that you 
want your kid to develop. &nbsp;Plus, most families have a raft of
out-of-schooling activities and other pulls on their time. &nbsp;In order to 
prevent the crises when events collide, it really does help to have a system 
that everyone can use. &nbsp;In our family, we manage time with&nbsp;Google 
calendars &mdash; we have one for the kids (they might end up with one each 
when they get older), one for the parents&rsquo; public information, and one 
for each parent&rsquo;s private information. &nbsp;(My family needs to know 
that on a certain day between certain times, I am seeing clients and am 
therefore unavailable. &nbsp;They neither need to know nor care which clients 
I&rsquo;m seeing each hour.) &nbsp;The nice thing about this system is that any 
member of the family can make changes which then everyone can see, and any 
member of the family can create an appointment for anyone else &mdash; I can 
let Little Bird know that we have company coming on a certain evening, so she 
can&rsquo;t count on homework help then, for example.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Similarly, we have a family set of task lists &mdash; since 
we&rsquo;re an iPhone / iPod Touch family, we use an app called GeeTasks that 
interfaces withGoogle Tasks. &nbsp;Each of us creates the tasks we need, but 
anyone can edit any list. &nbsp;Very useful for groceries and errands, too! 
&nbsp; It can handle some level of hierarchy, although for most complex tasks, 
I think it&rsquo;s okay to maintain the separate assignment sheet the teacher 
handed out, or the separate outline you created for yourself in something like
OmniOutliner or FreeMind (more on that below).</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The low-tech version, of course, is the Official Family Calendar, 
located at some central place in the household (usually the kitchen). &nbsp;You 
can use an ordinary monthly calendar, or whatever other calendar system is both
<em>easy for everyone to write in</em> and <em>easy for everyone to check</em>. 
&nbsp;A whiteboard that shows two months is okay, but I tend to prefer systems 
that allow the entry of information arbitrarily far into the future and 
don&rsquo;t require periodic recopying. &nbsp;If you like that size/form 
factor, try using alarge desktop monthly-organizer pad pinned to a corkboard. 
&nbsp;The problem I have with this system is that it&rsquo;s usually hard for
<em>kids</em> to write in these, just because they&rsquo;re not in the kitchen 
when most of the information they need to write down is given to them. &nbsp;So 
they need to capture those ideas &mdash; essentially, creating an assignment 
for themselves to write the information into the family calendar. &nbsp;Again, 
I tend to be skeptical of two-step systems, but they&rsquo;re better than an 
implied system where one of the steps is inevitably going to be, &ldquo;Forget 
to enter the information where it actually needs to go.&rdquo; &nbsp;If you 
have a system like this, consider also implementing a regular adult task that 
involves sitting down with the kid and extracting the relevant information from 
the kid&rsquo;s planner. &nbsp;(Yeah, I&rsquo;m not enthusiastic about that, 
either.)</strong></p> 
<p><strong>For whichever version, teach kids to write down <em>all</em> of the 
pulls on their time. &nbsp;Sports, music, arts, classes, practice times, 
religious services, family dinners, parties, company, hang-out-with-friends, TV 
shows you can&rsquo;t bear to miss, whatever it is that you spend time on, if 
you&rsquo;re going to want to spend time on it and you&rsquo;re not going to 
want to do homework during that time, it&rsquo;s a good idea to put it in the 
calendar. &nbsp;Obviously, some things might have to get moved or deleted if 
there is too much homework. &nbsp;But the goal is to avoid those last-minute 
crises where the Science Fair project and the cousin&rsquo;s wedding come into 
sharp conflict.</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>A word about school-based online systems: </em></strong>These 
are nice things to have,<em>as a&nbsp;backup</em> for when some information 
escapes the best efforts to corral it, and as a way for adults who are helping 
a kid to know the answer to the question, &ldquo;What do you have for homework 
tonight?&rdquo; before they ask it. &nbsp;Having them is better than not having 
them. &nbsp;But&nbsp;<em>they cannot substitute</em> for having your own 
planner, for several reasons.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Teachers are, um, not always entirely reliable about writing in them. 
&nbsp;If I had a buck every time one of my slippery-fish kiddos with ADHD said, 
&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t think we really had to do that assignment, because 
she didn&rsquo;t put it up on the website,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do 
it because I didn&rsquo;t write down what the teacher said because I thought 
they were supposed to put it up on the website so now I don&rsquo;t quite know 
what it is I have to do,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d be rich. &nbsp;Kids need to know the 
rule: &nbsp;It is&nbsp;<em>your</em> job to get the assignment written down, 
even if your teacher screws up and doesn&rsquo;t write it on the website. 
&nbsp;You&nbsp;<em>will</em> be marked down, and it&nbsp;<em>will</em> be your 
fault, and&nbsp;I will have&nbsp;<em>no</em> sympathy. &nbsp;(Personally, I 
have a comic-villain evil laugh that I reserve for such situations.)</li> 
<li>Using them requires that you check in several different places in order to 
find out what you have to do.</li> 
<li>They don&rsquo;t include the information for anything not related to 
school.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong><em><strong><em>Task focus vs. time focus:</em> </strong>This is 
complicated. &nbsp;To-do lists are good for managing tasks, while calendars are 
good for managing time. &nbsp;The two aren&rsquo;t the same thing, but 
they&rsquo;re intertwined. &nbsp;In fact, I think this is the single most 
tricky and dangerous aspect of system design, and one on which I have the 
fewest specific suggestions. &nbsp;Think about what information you need to 
have available to you, and under what circumstances you need to have it, what 
you want it to do to tell you about it.</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Most kids are not appointment-driven; rather, they are 
project-driven (for adults, it depends a lot on the type of job you have). 
&nbsp;Now think about most appointment books: they show you your day in terms 
of half-hour blocks. &nbsp;Is that the information kids need? &nbsp;Nope. 
&nbsp;In fact, the only nice thing I can say about most planner books provided 
by the school is that they tend to be organized by subject, rather than by 
time. &nbsp;You can mimic one, sans the huge amounts ofchartjunk usually found 
in kid-oriented ones, and with enough lines for the different 
&ldquo;subjects&rdquo; in kids&rsquo; real lives, if you buy ateachers&rsquo; 
planner, except that teachers are often assumed not to need to plan anything on 
the weekends. &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;You can design and print your own pages pretty 
easily in any word-processing software, if you prefer.</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>You want it when?</em> Most folks never even think about this 
issue&hellip; On which day in the planner do you write your homework?</strong>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong><em>The day it was assigned?</em> That&rsquo;s what most teachers 
tell kids to do, but it&rsquo;s probably the least useful time to write 
something &mdash; it&rsquo;s going to vanish into the 
&ldquo;this-already-happened&rdquo; ether much too quickly.</strong></li> 
<li><strong><em>The day it&rsquo;s due?</em> That&rsquo;s what most grownups 
tend to do with major projects. &nbsp;The danger point here is that you 
aren&rsquo;t going to be reminded of the task until the last minute. &nbsp;This 
practice tends to support procrastination. &nbsp;Not that you shouldn&rsquo;t 
include a note on the day something is due (after all, it will help you 
remember to hand it in!), but that&rsquo;s rarely sufficient. &nbsp;I recommend 
also writing tasks on&hellip;</strong></li> 
<li><strong><em>The day you&rsquo;re going to work on it. </em>Interesting 
idea, eh? &nbsp;Plan a time to work on it, so that when you sit down to work on 
any given day, you have an agenda in front of you. &nbsp;Good for avoiding 
collisions and encouraging kids to work on things before the last minute.
</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>Planning work time also requires kids to predict how long they think a task 
or subtask will take&hellip; and thus provides a good opportunity for them to 
also track how long something<em>actually</em> took, so that they can become 
more accurate predictors in the future. &nbsp;I suggest that kids plan in 
liberal amounts of &ldquo;slush time,&rdquo; planning a set of benchmarks that 
keeps them comfortably ahead of schedule, to deal with the inevitable 
complexities and delays that arise.</p> 
<p>Of course, sometimes that planning is itself a nontrivial task &mdash; in 
fact, it&rsquo;s the first task in the assignment, and should probably be done 
as soon as possible. &nbsp;So teach them to write an assignment for, e.g., 
&nbsp;&rdquo;Schedule time to work on book report,&rdquo; the day the book 
report is assigned. &nbsp;Kids are likely to need a lot of guidance in the 
process of breaking down tasks, keeping track of subtasks, redoing the schedule 
when things don&rsquo;t work out the way they planned, and generally keeping 
any complex project on track (beyond the scope of this already-very-long post).
</p> 
<p>Extensive assignment sheets (for major projects) usually belong in page 
protectors (each page in its own, please, so that you can read them easily, 
don&rsquo;t stuff a multi-page stapled thing into something that will require 
you to take it out to read the inside pages!), placed in the rings at the 
beginning of the relevant section of thebinder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, since I 
type rapidly, I often take the time to simply retype those sheets into my 
computer (or get an electronic copy from the teacher or the website), which 
eliminates concerns about losing them. &nbsp;Teach kids the habit of rechecking 
the assignment sheet as they go, rather than trying to remember what the 
teacher expected and when any intermediate due dates might have been.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Routine Maintenance:</em> You need to create structures and 
routines for when you look at the planner and what you do with it &mdash; every 
night before bed to preview the next day? &nbsp;Every day before you leave 
school to make sure you&rsquo;ve gotten the right items from your locker? 
&nbsp;Every single time someone asks you to commit to doing something on a 
specific date? &nbsp;Every week to check the status of ongoing projects? 
&nbsp;Every month to offload old pages and make sure you have new blank ones? 
&nbsp;Do you need to create &ldquo;ticklers&rdquo; to remind you of things that 
you&rsquo;ve put off far into the future?</strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong><strong>If you have an electronic system, think about how 
you are going to use reminders intelligently. &nbsp; What will you need to be 
reminded about? &nbsp;When will you need to be reminded about it? &nbsp;How you 
would like that reminder to happen? &nbsp;Alarms may be useful, but not if 
you&rsquo;re just going to snooze them or ignore them &mdash; think about what 
moment you&rsquo;d like a reminder to come such that you will actually do the 
thing before forgetting about it (we call these 
&ldquo;point-of-performance&rdquo; reminders).</strong></p> 
<p>Whoof! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to think about and chew on. 
&nbsp;Partly because both technology and paper products change so quickly, 
it&rsquo;s easy to get mired into trying to design a single best system, or to 
invest a lot of money and effort setting up something that seems cool only to 
have it collapse under its own weight. &nbsp;The key is to get something that 
you can get all of your information into (so that you can trust that everything 
you need to know is in there), and get all of your information out of&hellip; 
reliably and simply. &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t overcomplexificate things. &nbsp;See 
what works and where the bugs are, solve the problems and improve the system 
over time.</p>

<h2>out-of-schooling</h2> August 28, 2010 Aimee Yermish 8 comments <br>

<p>I wrote the notes for this post this while hanging out at the Middlesex 
County 4-H Fair this past weekend. Little Bird has been active in 4-H for 
several years, and Laughing Boy has been an enthusiastic hanger-on and will be 
a Cloverbud this coming year. I have to say, I<em>really</em> like 4-H (or at 
least its local instantiation) as a program for gifted kids&hellip; Hence the 
topic of this post. Not all extracurriculars (cocurriculars? 
&nbsp;paracurriculars? &nbsp;intracurriculars? activities? 
&nbsp;afterschooling? &nbsp;outofschooling? &nbsp;homeschooling?) are created 
equal, so it&rsquo;s worth thinking about what would characterize good ones. 
&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot that I see being done well here.</p> 
<p>Why care specifically about this topic for gifted and twice-exceptional 
kids? Certainly,<em>all</em> kids benefit from high-quality activities. But 
it&rsquo;s<em>particularly</em> important for GT and 2E kids, because they all 
too often don&rsquo;t get enough of the self-efficacy and empathic mirroring / 
accreditation experiences that most kids get in school. (Yes, I&rsquo;ll 
explain that more at some point. Short version: it&rsquo;s a normal and 
important human need to accomplish tasks you perceive to be difficult, and to 
experience people you look up to seeing you do it.) So the activities 
aren&rsquo;t just for fun and games &mdash; we&rsquo;re creating the 
opportunity for a developmental need to be met.</p> 
<p>4-H is a very <strong>flexible</strong> program, which can definitely be 
bewildering at times, but the flexibility is great for gifted and 2E kids.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>There are clubs focused on a broad range of topics &mdash; kids choose a 
club (or multiple clubs) based on<strong> shared interests</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong>Age doesn&rsquo;t restrict what you can do</strong>, how you can 
do it, or who you can do it with. &nbsp;A single club might have kids from ages 
5 to 18.</li> 
<li>The club (or other voluntary subgrouping) might do things together, but 
<strong>kids do lots of things on their own</strong>. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s normal 
and accepted. &nbsp;Groups, when they exist for a specific purpose, are formed 
by mutual consensus.</li> 
<li><strong>Kids choose projects they&rsquo;re interested in</strong>, rather 
than being told what they have to work on or being provided with a narrow menu 
of acceptable choices. &nbsp;Almost any topic is fair game for the projects 
they work on during the year (it&rsquo;s not just chickens and zucchini!) and 
their Visual Presentations (more on those below). &nbsp;For the fair itself, 
there&rsquo;s quite a range of things kids can make and exhibit, and there are 
departments at our local fair which permit written or display entries on 
virtually any topic (our county had a passionate GT kid and supportive parent 
who established a Writing department about a decade ago).</li> 
<li><strong>They can approach the projects at any level of sophistication they 
like</strong>. &nbsp;This is a perfect example of what I call &ldquo;silent 
differentiation,&rdquo; which will be the topic of another post.</li> </ul> 
<p>(Note that for some kids with Asperger&rsquo;s or ADHD, programs which have 
more structure are sometimes a better fit. &nbsp;Or else, they need more adult 
direction. &nbsp;But the fact is,<em>all</em> kids need some adult direction 
early in<em>any</em> process, and that direction needs to be faded <em>gradually
</em>over time. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t back off all at once, or they will have no 
idea where to go or what they<em>could</em> or <em>should</em> expect from 
themselves. &nbsp;Again, a topic for another post.)</p> 
<p>Another thing that 4-H does very well is to encourage kids to <strong>
improve over time</strong> and <strong>meet meaningful quality standards
</strong>.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>They are encouraged to <strong>try new things</strong> (the official 
slogan is &ldquo;<strong>Learn by doing.</strong>&ldquo;). &nbsp;They 
don&rsquo;t have to show any particular talent for anything; in general, any 
time someone says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in maybe doing X,&rdquo; the 
response will be, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool! &nbsp;Here, let me &nbsp;show you / 
hook you up with the following person / resource / class / book / website so 
you can learn how.&rdquo;</li> 
<li>At the same time, they are also constantly encouraged to &ldquo;<strong>
Make the best better.</strong>&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s the official motto, not to 
be confused with the official slogan). &nbsp;They get<strong>real feedback that 
is supportive but honest and specific</strong>. &nbsp;None of that false 
feel-good &ldquo;self-esteem&rdquo; nonsense that pervades a lot of kids&rsquo; 
activities these days, where, as the Dodo Bird says, &ldquo;<em>Everybody</em> 
has won, and all must have prizes.&rdquo; &nbsp;Judges in all events are 
explicitly told to give clear and understandable feedback on which aspects of 
the entry were done well and how the entry could be improved, and to measure 
kids against developmentally-appropriate but meaningfully high standards. 
&nbsp;(Even the judges for the Cloverbuds (kids ages 5-7) are told not to just 
say, &ldquo;Nice job!&rdquo;) &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not there yet, that&rsquo;s 
fine, no one will sneer at you, but they also won&rsquo;t tell you it&rsquo;s 
good when it&rsquo;s not. &nbsp;If what you do is terrific, they&rsquo;ll tell 
you, but they&rsquo;ll<em>still</em> tell you how to make it <em>even better.
</em></li> 
<li>I&rsquo;m sure there are many different flavors of how this is done in 
many different places, but what I see around here is a nice<strong>balance 
between competition against the self and competition against others</strong>. 
&nbsp;In the fair, first, everything is judged on an arbitrary standard. 
&nbsp;If everything is blue-ribbon quality, everything can get a blue ribbon. 
&nbsp;If nothing is, then nothing gets a blue ribbon and no prizes are awarded, 
as per previous bullet. &nbsp;(This really does happen. &nbsp;Judges are not 
pressured to make anyone &ldquo;not feel bad.&rdquo;) &nbsp;The blue-ribbon 
items then compete against each other for first, second, and third place. 
&nbsp;So it matters who else shows up, but there&rsquo;s a way for you to 
realize that someone else&rsquo;s work having been better doesn&rsquo;t mean 
that what you did stinks.</li> 
<li>The culture of the group <strong>honestly celebrates hard work and 
achievement</strong>, regardless of the personal characteristics of the 
achiever. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m pretty tuned in to such things (having had a fairly 
typical GT-kid childhood, I&rsquo;m actually more like &ldquo;hypervigilant 
about such things&rdquo;), and I haven&rsquo;t heard any of the typical 
&ldquo;catty&rdquo; comments about how someone is too young, or&nbsp;taking too 
many prizes, or making other kids feel bad, or should let someone else have a 
turn at winning, or must have gotten inappropriate help from a grownup, or 
whatever. &nbsp;People certainly notice a particular person earning a lot of 
awards, but it&rsquo;s generally with a sense of frank admiration for the 
effort and skill they know the kid put in.</li> </ul> 
<p>Speaking of the culture of the group, this is one that tends to attract a 
crowd marked by<strong>curiosity and passion</strong>, highly enriched for 
bright-to-gifted folks. &nbsp;And everyone is encouraged to get into the game.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It&rsquo;s not designed as a place you drop your kids off and go do the 
shopping. &nbsp;Club leaders are told to encourage parents (even dads!) and 
siblings (even annoying little ones!) to stick around and participate. 
&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a<strong>whole-family intergenerational activity</strong>.</li>
<li>That makes it possible for&nbsp;<strong>adults to model their own process 
as lifelong learners</strong>. &nbsp;Gifted kids tend to have gifted parents, 
which can be really tough for them. &nbsp;They see us being wonderful at 
everything, and then try to hold themselves to those impossibly high standards. 
&nbsp;But the culture here encourages parents to learn new things and be klutzy 
beginners (and to get corrective feedback and survive the experience!) together 
with their kids. &nbsp;<strong>Asking for and receiving help are seen as 
</strong><em><strong>good</strong></em><strong> things.</strong></li> 
<li>I mentioned above that <strong>people love to teach what they know</strong>
. &nbsp;People who are passionate and geeky about things tend to love to share 
with others. &nbsp;The openness of the structure allows for more of that to 
happen. &nbsp;Because this structure doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of rules around 
age or status,<strong>anyone who knows something can be a valid teacher</strong>
.</li> </ul> 
<p>Although some bumbling is inevitable in any volunteer effort, this 
doesn&rsquo;t have to create a blind-leading-the-blind race to the bottom. 
&nbsp;In any domain, there are likely to be quite a lot of skills which can be 
meaningfully taught at an appropriate level by someone who is further along the 
path, such that<em>both</em> teacher and learner are able to meaningfully 
increase their understanding and skill, and to derive self-efficacy from doing 
so. &nbsp;(That&rsquo;s very different from an overwhelmed teacher assigning a 
GT kid to tutor a struggling student in school, which has all sorts of rotten 
social and emotional consequences and is not educationally all that useful for 
either kid, and which probably should be the topic of another post.)</p> 
<p>Another thing I think 4-H does really well is, tied in with the 
high-standards thing, encouraging kids to<strong>build transferable life skills
</strong>. &nbsp;Although the program in MA goes way beyond its agricultural 
roots, it is still fundamentally a program to train young people to run small 
businesses.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Kids are encouraged to <strong>keep careful records</strong> of their 
projects, tracking time, costs, income, and suchlike. &nbsp;They are also 
encouraged to track people helped and lessons learned, and to include 
personal-development things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily officially part of a 
project. &nbsp;Kids whose records are clear, understandable, and comprehensive 
get recognized for<em>those</em> efforts, even if the projects were not all 
that elaborate or impressive. &nbsp;Similarly, kids who enter a lot of exhibits 
in the fair (and many kids enter several dozen&nbsp;items) have to handle the 
organizational overhead (paperwork, entry slips, explanatory cards, etc) 
themselves. &nbsp;(Yeah, I know, I hate paperwork, too. &nbsp;But that 
doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth being good at it. 
&nbsp;There are times when the person the paperwork is helping is yourself, 
especially&nbsp;when you&rsquo;re running a small business.) &nbsp;As the kids 
get older, the records start to look very much like resumes. &nbsp;(Yes, the 
recordkeeping requirements can be difficult for dysgraphic kids&hellip; but at 
least in my state, they&rsquo;re voluntary, there&rsquo;s a long time to get 
things done, and because of that &ldquo;silent differentiation&rdquo; effect, 
they can actually serve as a forum for the kids to build skills over time.)</li>
<li>There is a strong emphasis on <strong>public speaking</strong>, both 
formal and informal. &nbsp;There is a nice public speaking program &mdash; kids 
prepare 3-10-minute talks on any topic they like, with posters and 3-D objects, 
kind of like Show and Tell on steroids. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s highly competitive. 
&nbsp;Plus, kids are encouraged to do various forms of demonstration for the 
public. &nbsp;I have to say that every time I talk with a 4-H kid, even those 
5-7-year-old Cloverbuds, I am astounded at how well they can<em>have</em> those 
conversations with an unfamiliar kid, older kid, or adult. &nbsp;Almost without 
fail, I see kids who speak politely and intelligently, with appropriate social 
pragmatics, responding thoroughly to questions, and showing their enthusiasm 
for their work. &nbsp;(Another nice thing about that, by the way, is that when 
they get random-people-from-the-public to see how well they&rsquo;ve done and 
how well they can present themselves, it becomes another opportunity for them 
to see that others respect their work.)</li> 
<li>Parents are encouraged to participate, but they are expected to <strong>
keep their own hands off the kids&rsquo; work</strong>. &nbsp;Better to let it 
be unfinished or imperfect and to create a learning opportunity for the kid. 
&nbsp;When I&rsquo;ve had those lovely conversations with quite young kids, 
their parents are typically<em>not</em> hovering around. &nbsp;The focus is on 
building<strong>independence</strong>.</li> 
<li>Kids are also encouraged to participate in <strong>leadership and 
community service projects</strong>, again often taking on organizational roles 
that one might assume are only for older kids. &nbsp;(Little Bird was helping 
run kids&rsquo; activities for a community group that needed supervision for 
their own kids while parents were in a seminar&hellip; when she was 8 years 
old.) &nbsp;Kids who show promise in these areas get noticed and encouraged to 
take on more responsibility.</li> </ul> 
<p>This all reads practically like a recipe for &ldquo;how to design an 
out-of-school activity that helps kids develop real skills and real 
self-esteem.&rdquo; &nbsp;Since our GT and 2E kids are so often not 
well-matched to the in-school activities, and because there are so many choices 
for out-of-school stuff, many of which simply replicate the problems with the 
typical in-school activities, it becomes crucial for us to think about how we 
can recognize the subtexts in an activity that will support the kids&rsquo; 
growth.</p> Categories: executive functioning, outside of school,

<h2>Meetings: the final&nbsp;frontier</h2> August 24, 2010 Aimee Yermish Leave 
a comment <br>

<p>In this article, a parent of a child with significant learning disabilities 
writes about how having her son in the meeting provided important information 
to the IEP team about the reality of what was going on in the classroom. 
&nbsp;A few good grades were being taken out of context to indicate that he was 
doing extremely well, and the team was on the verge of exiting him from the 
special education system, until he pointed out that there were good reasons why 
he had done well on those assignments that had nothing to do with his 
disabilities having magically been cured.</p> 
<p>
http://www.ncld.org/at-school/your-childs-rights/advocacy-self-advocacy/a-parents-perspective-why-my-son-attended-his-own-iep-meetings
</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent point. &nbsp; But I&rsquo;d like to extend it. 
&nbsp;I would say that in general, kids&rsquo; input should<em>always</em> be 
sought in the IEP process, as well as in any legal or other processes where 
grownups are talking with each other and making high-stakes decisions about 
them.</p> 
<p>If a kid cannot behave in the meeting or tolerate having all of those 
grownups talking about them or about their situation, okay, fine. &nbsp;Have a 
parent, therapist, guide, adult friend, or other safe adult who does not work 
for the school (or court, or whatever), someone who has no reason to pressure 
the child to give any specific answers, sit with the child ahead of time. 
&nbsp;Explain the purpose of the meeting, explain the questions that the adults 
will be thinking through, and take the time to make sure the child understands 
as well as they are developmentally able to. &nbsp;(Since I work primarily with 
gifted andmultiply-exceptional kids, they tend to be able to understand this 
information at very young ages, and they tend to be very upset when they are 
aware of people talking about them without seeking their input.) &nbsp;Invite 
the child to offer their own experiences, ideas, or opinions. &nbsp;Ask things 
like, &ldquo;What would you like the grownups to know?&rdquo; &nbsp;&rdquo;What 
would a good solution look like for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you most hoping 
(or most worrying) that they will say?&rdquo; &nbsp;And listen attentively to 
the answer. &nbsp;If you can predict what the adults&rsquo; concerns about the 
child&rsquo;s proposals might be, offer them for the child&rsquo;s 
consideration. &nbsp;You might be surprised how much depth of thought you will 
hear.</p> 
<p>(Side note: those who are fans of Ross Greene and Stuart Ablon&rsquo;s work 
around teaching kids to self-regulate will recognize this process, and those 
who are not familiar with it should readtheir book (professionals should read 
this one) or check out the website. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just for 
&ldquo;explosive&rdquo; kids.)</p> 
<p>I also strongly believe that as soon as the kids <em>are</em> capable of 
tolerating the experience, they should be members of the team and participate 
in&nbsp;the meetings themselves. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to see them there by late 
middle school or early high school age, and absolutely by late high school age. 
&nbsp;If they need to have an educational advocate, therapist, adult friend, or 
other non-parental helpful person sitting next to them to help them understand 
what is going on and to help them figure out how to express their own ideas 
appropriately, then that&rsquo;s a great service to provide for them.</p> 
<p>Think about it&hellip; when they&rsquo;re 18 years old, legally, they <em>
chair</em> the IEP meetings. &nbsp;If they don&rsquo;t want help, we 
can&rsquo;t force them to accept it. &nbsp;We can&rsquo;t schedule a meeting if 
they don&rsquo;t consent, and we can&rsquo;t hold a meeting if they don&rsquo;t 
show up. &nbsp;Absent certain really seriously exacerbating circumstances, 
adults have the right to make their own decisions, no matter how foolish. 
&nbsp;(I have personally see this play out, at times tragically, in a few 
situations, where a newly-minted legal adult made decisions that were mostly 
informed by their lack of experience.)</p> 
<p>So part of the goal of the whole process is to train them to be good at the 
role of team member, and eventually to take on the role of team<em>captain</em>
. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s good, because in real life, we are all captains of our own 
teams. &nbsp;This is a great thing for them to learn to do, and a nice 
well-constructed venue for them to learn to do it in. &nbsp;But they 
won&rsquo;t learn how to do it without guided practice.</p> 
<p>Are there kids for whom this kind of self-determination is not a realistic 
goal? &nbsp;Certainly, there is a very tiny minority of children who will not 
be able to handle it, even with guidance and training and practice. &nbsp;But 
if you feel that a kid shouldn&rsquo;t be present in their own IEP meetings by 
the mid to late teenage years, chances are good that you also need to be 
thinking about legal guardianship or conservatorship in adulthood. &nbsp;If you 
feel that a certain 16-year-old cannot even meaningfully<em>participate</em> in 
a meeting that may decide the course of their life, then I would be very, very 
concerned about that same person at 18 years old having the right to manage all 
aspects of their life on their own.</p> 
<p>If your concern is that the child may be upset by the process, particularly 
if the child&rsquo;s disability affects their emotional stability, let me say 
two things. &nbsp;First, by high school age, even kids who are below average in 
intelligence tend to be aware that people are making decisions about them 
without their participation. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s really upsetting, too. 
&nbsp;Second, one of my predoctoral internships was atthe Arlington School. 
&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not in Arlington. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a therapeutic high school 
on the campus ofMcLean Hospital, one of the world&rsquo;s premier psychiatric 
hospitals. &nbsp;The kids there are all there, at<em>enormous</em> school 
district expense, because they have debilitating major mental illnesses and 
really honestly cannot emotionally handle being in a regular high school. 
&nbsp;If you were going to say that a kid couldn&rsquo;t handle being in their 
own IEP meeting, those kids would be high on the list of kids you&rsquo;d 
assume couldn&rsquo;t cope. &nbsp;Yet they do, and dialogue with them is an 
important part of the process both for the team and for them as they move into 
adulthood. &nbsp;So I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be too quick to assume that a 
kid can&rsquo;t learn to tolerate the experience.</p> 
<p>Properly handled, having kids participate in their own meetings can 
contribute to their own maturational process. &nbsp;Special education 
shouldn&rsquo;t be something we do<em>to</em> kids, it should be something we do
<em>with</em> them.</p> Categories: advocacy, executive functioning,

<h2>Clues on finding a therapist for a gifted&nbsp;client</h2> August 20, 2010 
Aimee Yermish 29 comments <br>

<p>This is another topic I get asked about a lot&hellip; &ldquo;My kid is 
really struggling to adjust, to make sense of himself in a world that 
doesn&rsquo;t quite understand him. I think therapy would help, but how do I 
find someone who really &ldquo;gets&rdquo; the whole gifted thing?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is a huge problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;A recent publication from my esteemed 
mentor, Jean Peterson, showed that most accredited counselor training programs 
offer<em>zero</em> training in understanding giftedness, and those that do have 
only very tiny amounts of time spent on the topic. &nbsp;And I worry, frankly, 
about what is actually being taught when anything&rsquo;s being taught&hellip; 
whether they are just continuing to promulgate the same typical myths about how 
gifted kids &ldquo;will be just fine on their own.&rdquo; &nbsp;There 
aren&rsquo;t any studies yet looking at training programs for psychologists, 
but my sense of it is that, if anything, the situation is worse, since 
&ldquo;gifted education&rdquo; exists as a distinct field, while &ldquo;gifted 
psychology&rdquo; kinda basically doesn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Basically, giftedness is 
not considered a relevant dimension of human difference or cultural experience. 
&nbsp;Gifted folks are just like everyone else except that we got As in school 
and we&rsquo;re all just fine. &nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t we? &nbsp;<em>&lt;cough, 
cough&hellip;&gt;</em></p> 
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just a problem for kids, either. &nbsp;Gifted adults <em>
also</em> struggle to make sense of ourselves in a world that often isn&rsquo;t 
even remotely a good fit. &nbsp;Giftedness isn&rsquo;t just a school-bound 
phenomenon, and it doesn&rsquo;t expire upon graduation &mdash; we are who we 
are across domains and throughout the lifespan.</p> 
<p>I wish I had some easy answers. &nbsp;My dissertation research, on the 
therapeutic working alliance between gifted clients and their therapists, was 
useful in that it showed where some of the major pitfalls were. &nbsp;But it 
didn&rsquo;t help with the basic problem that most therapists think they<em>do
</em> get it (an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect, where the lack of 
knowledge and metacognitive skills in a domain interferes with accurate 
self-assessment of skill in a domain &mdash; basically, if you don&rsquo;t know 
what you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t know that you don&rsquo;t know it). 
&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s like in education: if you ask someone if they understand 
giftedness, they&rsquo;ll all tell you they do, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a 
whole heck of a lot.</p> 
<p>Plus, a lot of providers seem to think that &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; means 
&ldquo;fiscally gifted,&rdquo; and they see us as high-functioning clients who 
are likely to provide a nice revenue stream (as Tom Lehrer said, they think 
they&rsquo;re specializing in &ldquo;diseases of the rich&ldquo;), so they 
advertise claiming this as a specialty area. &nbsp;<em>We</em> know that gifted 
folk are found in every social, ethnic, racial, and economic group, but, well, 
like I said, a lot of folks don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</p> 
<p>So what we need is a way to interview prospective providers to find out 
what they<em>actually</em> know, rather than what they&rsquo;ll tell you they 
know.</p> 
<p>I know, we&rsquo;re all afraid to talk about it (I should really put up a 
rant about gifties as a closeted minority), but we have to. &nbsp;If we 
don&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t either &mdash; remember, they think it&rsquo;s 
not relevant.</p> 
<p>So,&nbsp;I would advise specifically bringing up the topic of giftedness 
and multiple exceptionality with any prospective therapist in a nonthreatening 
but clear way, one which focuses on observable behavior &mdash; &ldquo;What 
experience do you have working with folks who are highly intelligent? 
&nbsp;What do you see as the major risk and resilience factors in this 
population? &nbsp; Have you found it necessary to adapt your approach in 
working with gifted folks? &nbsp;If so, how, and what is your rationale for 
that?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Pay attention not just to the content of the responses, but also to the 
nonverbal signals and your gut feeling about how they&rsquo;re responding to 
the notion. If you feel like you&rsquo;re getting a dismissive or hostile 
reaction,<em>go somewhere else</em> and don&rsquo;t feel bad about it. 
&nbsp;Really. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re not crazy (okay, you might be, but I&rsquo;m 
not going to diagnose you via a blog). &nbsp;You might be a bit hypersensitive, 
sure (I see that a lot, especially from adult GT folks who had educationally or 
socially traumatic experiences in childhood), but in the shrink biz, they teach 
us to pay attention to those feelings.</p> 
<p>Ideally, I would want to hear someone <em>spontaneously</em> identify 
issues of social isolation, intense imaginations and emotions, and asynchrony 
between cognitive and emotional development, as all being relevant things to 
think about when working with gifted folks. &nbsp;Look up one of the many lists 
of myths and realities about giftedness (trythis one, or this one, or this one
), and if they start spouting any of these, try disagreeing gently. &nbsp;If 
you get push-back instead of thoughtful dialogue, just thank them nicely and 
walk.</p> 
<p>Second choice would be someone who can at least spontaneously admit that 
they are not knowledgeable in the area but would be interested in 
self-educating. &nbsp;If they want to self-educate, the (btw, I would recommend 
theModels of Counseling Gifted Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults book, 
edited by Jean Peterson and Sal Medaglio, for a professional to self-educate on 
the topic). &nbsp;There are some very good materials available on theSENG 
(Supporting the Emotional Needs of the Gifted) website, too. &nbsp;Or they could
call me for a short-term professional consultation &mdash; I&rsquo;m thrilled 
to be able to spread the knowledge here.</p> 
<p>Anyone who frames giftedness as being part of the problem, anyone who 
defines the intensity and drive and perceptiveness and differentness and 
postformal reasoning as &ldquo;the thing that&rsquo;s wrong with you,&rdquo; 
leave and don&rsquo;t look back. &nbsp;The goal is not to get our kids (or us!) 
to act like everyone else. &nbsp;The goal is to help us figure out who<em>we
</em> are and how to act like <em>ourselves,</em> just&nbsp;in an adaptive way.
</p> 
<p>I hate to have to say it, but I really do think that therapists who work 
with smart folks probably should be at least reasonably smart themselves, if 
for no other reason than so they can follow the logic and metaphor, quick 
thinking, intuitive leaps, and so on. &nbsp; Also, I would want someone who in 
your initial interview seems to have some level of personal empathy with those 
experiences &mdash; they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to have had them 
themselves, but it helps if they&rsquo;re close enough that they didn&rsquo;t 
experience their own intelligence as always a positive thing. &nbsp;Both of 
these showed up in my research as a very common theme in terms of what 
distinguished successful from unsuccessful alliances. &nbsp;Someone who is at 
least moderately bright and who is a good listener is okay for a client who is 
looking mainly for symptom relief, but for a client who needs a long-term 
mentor relationship, the respondents in my study were pretty clear on the 
topic&hellip; they need to be pretty smart. &nbsp;When you&rsquo;re trying to 
figure out who you are and how you&rsquo;re going to exist in the world, you 
don&rsquo;t want to have to wait around for the therapist to catch up, or to 
feel like you&rsquo;re doing all the work yourself.</p> 
<p>Note, however, that the therapist who happens to be gifted needs to have 
done their own work and come to some level of acceptance and understanding of 
their own intelligence. If they&rsquo;ve got unmetabolized &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; 
it&rsquo;s going to play out in the relationship. &nbsp;Some of the nastiest 
and most invalidating responses I&rsquo;ve personally experienced or heard 
about in my research came from professionals who were themselves very likely to 
be highly intelligent. I&rsquo;m not saying &ldquo;contrary,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m 
saying &ldquo;downright nasty.&rdquo; (in the biz, we&rsquo;d call those 
countertransference reactions).</p> 
<p>Another reason why it helps to have someone reasonably smart so that the 
kid will have a harder time snowing them if they try. &nbsp;The research on 
client honesty is pretty solid across the board &mdash; therapists tend not to 
know what clients hide from them. &nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard consistent reports 
from GT clients that if they weren&rsquo;t able to leave therapy (many child or 
adolescent clients don&rsquo;t feel they have much choice in the matter), they 
were highly successful not just in stonewalling, but in outright snowing 
therapists who they felt didn&rsquo;t empathize with them effectively (my 
favorite was the tweenaged client who structured her play so as to make her 
therapist come to certain interpretations).</p> 
<p>In general, gifted folk don&rsquo;t do as well in rigidly manualized 
treatments (which are, sadly, becoming extremely popular). 
&nbsp;Cognitive-behavioral techniques can be really useful<em>as tools</em>, 
but a flexible and collaborative approach is going to be key. Don&rsquo;t 
believe the press about &ldquo;evidence-based treatments.&rdquo; All forms of 
therapy have evidence to support them, and some forms are better than others 
for some clients for some kinds of situations &mdash; it&rsquo;s all very 
individual. And what the main body of evidence shows is that, as James Carville 
might have said, it&rsquo;s the relationship, stupid.</p> 
<p>Before you ask, no, I don&rsquo;t have a giant network of people I can 
recommend. &nbsp;You can try asking me privately if I know anyone in your 
geographical area, and I&rsquo;ll try, but no guarantees.</p> Categories:

<h2>Pile Containment Devices: an organizational&nbsp;alternative</h2> August 
15, 2010 Aimee Yermish 8 comments <br>

<p>The two-binder system I described in the previous post is, of course, not 
for everybody. It works well in situations where there are a lot of routine 
things going on, stuff happening on a daily or weekly basis in almost every 
area of study.</p> 
<p>However, particularly as we make it into adulthood &mdash; and I&rsquo;m 
willing to bet that there are some homeschoolers or afterschoolers who would 
also be in this boat &mdash; things are often organized less around routine 
stuff happening every day or week, and more around discrete<em>projects.</em> 
For a project, often you&rsquo;re handling many different pieces or chunks of 
paper, but the order of them not only doesn&rsquo;t count, it is often really
<em>helpful</em> to be able to move them around, spread them out on the table, 
mix and match, look at various things at the same time, and so on. Also, 
sometimes you want to toss a small book or workbook right into the pile (and 
might be tempted to shove papers into the book in order to corral them. 
Don&rsquo;t do it!).</p> 
<p>For instance, when I am doing a report on an assessment, I want to be able 
to grab one or more test protocols, the history, notes I took during the 
assessment, scoring worksheets and graphs I cooked up, spread them out, leaf 
through them, and then shove them away easily. For another instance, when I was 
working on the literature review for my dissertation, there were piles and 
piles of papers on various topics. And yet another &mdash; when my dishwasher 
had a catastrophic failure and I found myself managing an insurance company and 
a kitchen remodel while in grad school (I do not recommend this for amusement), 
there were all sorts of piles of stuff related to that. Moving across country, 
same thing.</p> 
<p>See, some of us have brains that, well, we think best in piles and 
networks. People who don&rsquo;t know much about brains like to call this a 
right-brained processing style, or a visual processing style (sorry, both of 
those concepts would get me laughed out of the cool neuropsych parties &mdash; 
the current research on the topic is much more complex than any such 
simple-minded dichotomy would support). The single hardest thing for me to do 
while writing is to get my thoughts into linear form. So why on earth would I 
like an organizational system that is linear in structure, like a binder? I 
literally can&rsquo;t find anything when I use time as the organizing 
principle. There are some kinds of situations where I keep track of stuff 
linearly, sure, but most of the time, nope.</p> 
<p>But of course, you linear folks are probably silently freaking out that 
I&rsquo;m about to tell your kid that it&rsquo;s okay to have piles of stuff 
all over the desk, the floor, the backpack, piling on top of each other, 
falling over, getting mixed up together, being indistinguishable from each 
other, oh, man, what a mess. Yes, that&rsquo;s the potential downfall of living 
life in the Pile Zone.</p> 
<p>Enter the Pile-Containment Devices: letter trays, portable pockets, 
accordion folders, and the like. Even hanging folders can work as PCDs, when 
they&rsquo;re not getting hidden in a file drawer and disappearing from memory. 
(I long ago gave up filing &ldquo;that is neat and I might want it 
someday&rdquo; stuff in my filing cabinets, because other than the few Really 
Important Things, I would tend to forget not just what I named the file it got 
put in, but even<em>that it ever existed at all.</em>)</p> 
<p>If you do your work basically at your desk, then try a whole bunch of 
horizontal letter trays, or a mail sorter (obviously, both of those items can 
be found in stylish versions, too, but I&rsquo;m showing cheap-and-ugly 
options). I like side-loading ones best, because it&rsquo;s easier to get a 
glimpse of what&rsquo;s on the papers. The concept here is that each pile now 
has a pigeonhole to go into.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re a moveable feast, then you need something portable. When 
I&rsquo;m handling one good-sized project with a bunch of different facets to 
it (e.g., job search), I have a 13-pocket accordion folder, made of durable 
plastic, likethis one. I&rsquo;ve had the same one for years, because I really 
cannot manage more than one project of accordion-file magnitude at a time 
(&ldquo;knowing your limits&rdquo; being another important aspect of executive 
functioning). The printed-out material I&rsquo;m organizing into the outline 
for my book (on, perhaps not surprisingly, helping bright-to-gifted folks with 
executive functioning) is in it right now &mdash; each section is a chapter. By 
the way, I have known some school-age kids to use an accordion file instead of 
the traveling zip binder, where each section is a class, and there&rsquo;s one 
section at the front for hot-folder items. You can do this, and it&rsquo;s 
quite an adequate system,<em>if</em> you are really good about keeping dates on 
pages, and if you are really good about emptying the thing on a very regular 
basis into the home-based permanent-storage binder, and if you don&rsquo;t mind 
that this routine is going to take a little longer because you have to impose 
order at that point.</p> 
<p>But in my life, I&rsquo;m generally juggling a bunch of different smallish 
projects at once. If I tried to keep<em>everything</em> in one accordion 
folder, I&rsquo;d get sick of carrying it around, and that&rsquo;s where the 
danger would happen &mdash; I&rsquo;d take a pile out to take with me 
somewhere, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have a Pile Containment Device any more and<em>
 the uncontrolled piles might escape.</em>Must. not. let. that. happen.</p> 
<p>When something outgrows an accordion folder, it&rsquo;s not really going to 
be particularly portable anyhow. A small portable hanging-file box 
(here&rsquo;s anopen one, and here&rsquo;s a somewhat bigger one with a lid and 
a handle) is a reasonable alternative (you can at least move it from place to 
place in the home). My aforementioned dissertation literature review took up a
full-sized hanging-file box (actually overflowed it by the end). As I wrote 
each section, the folder with that pile of papers got sent to the back of the 
box, providing an encouraging visual of my progress. Somehow, even though open 
file boxes aren&rsquo;t all that different from hanging files in a file drawer, 
the kind normal human beings seem to be able to manage, I don&rsquo;t lose 
track of stuff as easily when it&rsquo;s in open filing like that.</p> 
<p>Occasionally, if it&rsquo;s really only a few pieces of paper and the 
project is really short term, I do grab one of those awful two-pocket paper 
folders (see, I despise them so much I&rsquo;m not even making a link) that 
seem to spawn in my closet (they are refugees, I think, from Little 
Bird&rsquo;s elementary school&rsquo;s silly ideas about how to teach kids to 
organize themselves). But most of the time, I use a file pocket. I cannot find 
a link to the ones I use &mdash; I happened to spot these in a dollar store a 
few years ago, bought a couple, realized how excellent they were, went back and 
bought some more, and haven&rsquo;t seen them in any store since. I have about 
eight of these. They&rsquo;re thicker plastic than most, and they have elastic 
on the corners so they close and open easily, none of that mucking about with 
noisy Velcro or time-consuming string.Here is the closest match I was able to 
find online. I don&rsquo;t like flimsy clear-poly pockets &mdash; they feel 
like they&rsquo;re not going to hold up, and they aren&rsquo;t stiff enough to 
protect the papers well. I also don&rsquo;t like ones that have a rigid gusset 
&mdash; they&rsquo;re just asking to get crushed, and they take up too much 
space when they&rsquo;re not full. Good carry-around pockets are good for about 
an inch or two of paper, which handles quite a wide variety of projects. They 
are my go-to PCDs.</p> 
<p>If you really only have a few things you need to deal with at any given 
time, and, again, you&rsquo;re good about offloading things into long-term 
storage, think about something like acontractor&rsquo;s clipboard. I had one 
just like this one for years while in grad school the first time &mdash; I used 
letter trays on my desk and just used this lovely portable thing to take notes 
and hold important pieces of paper (hot-folder items) in the storage box (which 
also can hold a pencil). Look for one that has a cover (like the one I linked) 
to protect the pad from getting trashed. Sure, you could use a prettyportfolio, 
and that&rsquo;s what I use now for walking-around notetaking-with-clients, but 
there&rsquo;s some nice urban chic happening with the aluminum thing.</p> 
<p><strong>Important Troubleshooting Tip</strong>: The biggest potential 
downfall of the PCD system is that they need to be<strong> labeled</strong>. 
Otherwise, you will just have a whole pile of undifferentiated piles, and you 
will eventually start shoving things in randomly because you aren&rsquo;t sure 
what goes where, and you will waste time trying to find the pile you were 
looking for, so you&rsquo;re back to piles of piles of messy piles. If you 
change your pile labels frequently, try taping a pad of small post-it notes to 
your letter trays so you can write and rewrite. If you don&rsquo;t change them 
frequently, stickers or labels will work. Accordion files, of course, have 
those little divider tabs. If you&rsquo;re using portable pockets, you might be 
able to get away with color-coding (I do &mdash; I usually have some mnemonic 
association between the color and the project, and that&rsquo;s enough for me). 
But don&rsquo;t try it if you don&rsquo;t have to &mdash; look for pockets that 
have someplace to slip a paper label into them.</p> 
<p>Another potential pitfall: if your system has portable elements, they can 
get lost and then you have to waste time tearing up the house and screaming 
about the missing PCD. At least until some<em>other</em> unfinished project 
catches your eye and you start doing that instead, procrastinating the crisis 
(is that a transitive verb?) until some later date, probably long after its 
deadline. PCDs need homes to live in. If you can get yourself to commit to a 
consistent location (say, a desk or other workspace, which I&rsquo;ll have 
hints for in another post), then the discipline becomes that the PCDs always 
get returned to that location, not just dropped wherever they happen to be when 
your brain moves on to another task.</p> 
<p>And a third potential pitfall: &nbsp;when you switch away from that project 
to another task (as us low-working-memory high-idea-generation types do so 
often), the pile<em>needs to get swept back into the PCD.</em> That simple 
behavior is one of those things that organized people think, &ldquo;How 
difficult can this be?&rdquo; &nbsp;However, if that&rsquo;s a problem area, 
then it needs to get explicitly cued and practiced specifically until it 
becomes part of the PCD-use routine.</p> 
<p>Last thing (at least until I think of another one): you need to have a 
system for offloading the content of the PCD as the project shifts focus. 
&nbsp;That is, you need to get rid of obsolete stuff so it doesn&rsquo;t make 
the current stuff harder to find in the pile &mdash; if the pile has more than 
about a dozen items, two dozen at the outside, you&rsquo;re going to waste too 
much time searching it. &nbsp;Same thing with what you will do when a project 
is completed. &nbsp;Frequently, you can get rid of a lot of the intermediate 
materials, and then you need some sort of long-term storage for the stuff you 
want to keep. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the school-year binder, and 
Jeff mentioned rough-sort systems, but I&rsquo;ll have more to say about those 
things later on.</p> 
<p>For now, try it&hellip; embrace the piles&hellip; see how it works for 
you&hellip;</p> Categories: executive functioning, surviving school Tags:

<h2>On organization: Do not multiply entities&nbsp;needlessly</h2> August 11, 
2010 Aimee Yermish 25 comments <br>

<p>This is my usual starting organizational system for most kids who go to 
conventional schools. &nbsp;(I do a lot of adapting to individual situations 
and styles, of course, and I will make a separate post about an alternative 
system that I find useful in other situations.) &nbsp;I&rsquo;m with William of 
Ockham here: &nbsp;do not multiply entities needlessly. &nbsp;Principles and 
priorities, then, are simplicity, portability, ease of use, and resilience to 
not-being-used-quite-correctly.</p> 
<p>Start with a simple backpack or tote. &nbsp;You probably don&rsquo;t need 
wheels because you&rsquo;re not going to carry all that much most of the time. 
&nbsp;All you need is one big main pocket (for the binder and any books that 
have to come with you) and one small pocket (for pencils and such). 
&nbsp;Anything else is overcomplexificationisticalesque.</p> 
<p>Unless a teacher specifically requires that a textbook come to class, 
textbooks should live at home all the time. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t believe in 
using lockers for anything (other than maybe your coat), because (1) most 
schools don&rsquo;t provide enough time to go to them (2) they add a layer of 
complication, a location where things can get left by accident.</p> 
<p>You need one (1 (just one (not seven, but one))) 3-ring zip-binder, the 
kind where you have maybe a 1.5&Prime; ring binder in a cloth cover that zips 
all the way around (here&rsquo;s anexample). &nbsp;The magic word is &ldquo;in 
the Rings of the Binder.&rdquo; &nbsp;Not just In the Binder, but In the Rings. 
&nbsp;3 Rings to rule them all&hellip; &nbsp;The zip cover does two things. 
&nbsp;First, it protects the binder and the papers in it from getting destroyed 
when something else is shoved into the backpack. &nbsp;Second, it corrals any 
pieces of paper which have not yet made it into the Rings.</p> 
<p>Dividers, one for each class, in order through the school day if 
that&rsquo;s possible. &nbsp;Use clear plastic durable slash-folder dividers, 
like&nbsp;these.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some classes may require more than one section 
(English class is famous for this, with &ldquo;language arts&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;literature&rdquo; often being separate areas) &mdash; for the secondary 
divisions,ordinary dividers are fine.</p> 
<p>Plus, you need one ordinary divider for each kind of extra paper (lined, 
graph, plain) that will be required &mdash; put maybe 10-30 pages of blank 
paper in each. &nbsp;There should be no blank paper anywhere in the binder<em>
except</em> for those sections. &nbsp;If you are not forced to do otherwise, 
you should routinely use pale-lined graph paper filler (something likethis) for 
everything in math and science classes. &nbsp;My personal preference is for
engineering paper, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another post.</p> 
<p>Note that you now <em>already</em> have a &ldquo;hot folder&rdquo; system 
in place. &nbsp;Nothing separate is needed. &nbsp;For each subject, one side of 
the divider holds papers the teacher has handed out which haven&rsquo;t gotten 
Into the Rings yet, and the other side holds homework (and permission slips, 
etc) which is completed and not yet handed in. &nbsp;Use a Sharpie to mark 
which is which! &nbsp;Younger kids, who usually only have one teacher for most 
subjects which assign homework, can have a single hot-folder in the front of 
the binder. &nbsp;If they really prefer, they can have a separate hot-folder, 
but it must not be one of those cheap paper 2-pocket folders &mdash; those are 
not durable enough. &nbsp;Get something made of polypropylene, likethis.</p> 
<p>Also, have available at home a small box of page protectors, preferably 
matte-finish ones. &nbsp;These are used for things like course syllabi or 
assignment sheets, reference sheets for generic assignments (e.g., 
&ldquo;requirements for writing up a Problem of the Week&rdquo;), or other 
important long-term reference material (a periodic table for chemistry, etc). 
Those go at the start of the section for the relevant class and stay there as 
long as they are needed.</p> 
<p>The zip-binder usually has a zip pocket that can hold pencils and pens and 
anything else needed. &nbsp; If you use it, make sure that it&rsquo;s not in a 
location that makes it hard to lay paper flat and write on it. &nbsp;But 
it&rsquo;s probably just as well to put that stuff in the pocket designed for 
it in the backpack. &nbsp;Separate pencil cases are just more 
superfluositicalextracalifragilisticity.</p> 
<p>I strongly dislike traditional wood pencils. &nbsp;They require that you 
(1) keep a sharpener in the Pencil Pocket (2) notice when the point has gotten 
too dull for neat handwriting (which most kids with executive functioning 
problems have a surprisingly hard time with!) (3) stop what you&rsquo;re doing, 
sharpen the pencil successfully (which includes not dropping piles of shavings 
all over the floor when you have to keep opening the thing up to pry yet 
another broken point out of the razor), remember what it was you were doing, 
and then get back going again. &nbsp;Ugh. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have 
enough working memory for that. &nbsp;Mechanical pencils are now widely 
available in.9mm width, which is thick enough even for most kids who press too 
hard. &nbsp;I recommend the thinnest lead you won&rsquo;t keep breaking, the 
cheapest bulk version of that pencil you can find (.7mm,&nbsp;.5mm).</p> 
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think that anyone needs pens for school. &nbsp;Some 
teachers disagree with me and insist on work being done in pen. &nbsp;Harrumph. 
&nbsp;If they insist, I adviseplain old medium-point black stick pens, nothing 
fancy.</p> 
<p>I also don&rsquo;t think that highlighters have much use during the school 
day. &nbsp;Highlighting is almost completely useless as an active reading 
strategy for most people &mdash; it makes you feel like you&rsquo;re doing 
something, but what you&rsquo;re typically doing is a very surface-level 
syntactic analysis to find the key phrases without actually processing the 
information. &nbsp;If you like to use highlighters during tests, to highlight 
key phrases so that you make sure you answer the whole question, then sure, go 
ahead. &nbsp;Try to find highlighters that aren&rsquo;t fluorescent (= 
superstimulating).</p> 
<p>What I do like to see kids have around is some way of writing in color, 
whether that be colored pencils or colored pens. &nbsp;These are a must for 
physics or any other course involving diagrams, and really useful for a lot of 
note-taking enterprises. &nbsp;Colored and sort-of-erasable mechanical pencils 
do exist, although the leads are generally quite fragile &mdash; if you are 
gentle, use those, otherwise, a few colors of ball-point are fine. &nbsp;And 
you can use them for the active test-taking, too, and they don&rsquo;t glow.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re required to include a calculator, I don&rsquo;t think 
there&rsquo;s much need for anything else in the Pencil Pocket. It likes to 
collect lots of interesting little things (binder clips, staplers, etc), but 
we&rsquo;re back to William of Ockham there &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t need it, 
get rid of it.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll need a planner / assignment book / PDA of some kind, but 
that&rsquo;s a long topic, again, best saved for another post.</p> 
<p>At home, you need a good-sized D-ring binder, like this, with ordinary 
paper dividers to mirror the dividers in the traveling binder. &nbsp;If you 
overflow during the course of the school year, you can always split into two 
big binders.</p> 
<p>At home, you also need an ordinary stapler and a heavy-duty 3-hole punch 
(cheaper than you might think, and a worthwhile investment).</p> 
<p>When papers get into your hands, ideally, they should go into the Rings of 
the Binder. &nbsp;But if they don&rsquo;t, no worries, put them into the folder 
for the subject. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a rough sort that will get you through the 
week.</p> 
<p>Put a weekly appointment on the calendar. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll take ten 
minutes, tops, to go through the binder and the backpack and find all of the 
papers in those folders plus any stray calves. &nbsp;Ideally, no paper should 
ever be loose, but I live on Planet Earth, so I do understand. &nbsp;No 
recriminations, just find the stragglers and round &lsquo;em up, get &lsquo;em 
in the Rings. &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t worry about order within the Rings unless you 
like to do it &mdash; I&rsquo;d rather see you be consistent about doing a 
pretty good job than be perfect but never quite get around to it. &nbsp;Some 
people like to put new things in the back, others like to put them in the front 
of each section &mdash; either is fine, but<em>pick one</em> and <em>stick to 
it.</em> At the same time, if you&rsquo;re running out of filler paper, refill.
</p> 
<p>Either once a month, or at the end of every multi-week unit, take out 
everything that is not from the current month/unit or the immediately previous 
month/unit, and put it in the big D-ring binder at home. &nbsp;No paper gets 
thrown out, even if the teacher says you don&rsquo;t need to keep it or 
it&rsquo;s stupid or whatever. &nbsp;All pieces of paper get saved until the 
end of the year (actually, for a few years, if you think you might have any 
interaction with the special education system).</p> 
<p>Both of these reviews are almost impossible for most folks who struggle 
with organization to reliably do by themselves at first. When I&rsquo;m working 
with someone, we do them together at the start of every session, and we rely on 
a cue card or checklist that lives in the binder, too. Then we fade back to 
having them do it while I watch and cue them when they miss something. Then, if 
necessary, we teach a parent how to watch and cue them, and they do it before 
our session, so my weekly check is just to see that it&rsquo;s been done 
correctly. Then we fade back to having the parent remind them to do it and 
check afterwards that it&rsquo;s done correctly. Eventually, kids can do it on 
their own, but we wait at each step to see that it&rsquo;s happening reliably 
before we fade the support.</p> 
<p>I have some alternatives, which I&rsquo;ll cover in another post.</p>

<h2>Mommas, don&rsquo;t let your babies grow up to&nbsp;be&hellip;</h2> August 
5, 2010 Aimee Yermish 54 comments <br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an article making the rounds, which is funny 
because&nbsp;it&rsquo;s so true.</p> 
<p>
http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2010_07_23/caredit.a1000072
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Good morning, children, and welcome. Today&rsquo;s science demonstration 
will require a laptop, a printer, and 20 liters of coffee. This experiment is 
called &ldquo;Applying for Funding.&rdquo; &nbsp; &lt;snip&gt;</p> 
<p>Real scientists never enter a lab. We work our whole lives to become, if 
we&rsquo;re lucky, managers of sorts. We oversee, we organize, and we teach. We 
attend meetings and send e-mails. We think, we write, we debate, we format, and 
we complain. The day-to-day job of a scientist &mdash; a real one &mdash; 
isn&rsquo;t too different from that of, say, an insurance claims adjuster.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The article is mainly about the fact that the public perception of science 
as a profession is shaped largely by mad-scientist movies and whiz-bang 
demonstrations. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d have to add the constant stream of news stories 
in which some tiny incremental improvement in the state of our collective 
knowledge about how some ridiculously complicated natural system works and what 
we can do about some immense problem of human suffering, some little grain of 
sand added to the sandcastle of the Global University, is oversimplified and 
treated as an Amazing Breakthrough. &nbsp;We seem to forget, in the phrase, 
&ldquo;quantum leap,&rdquo; that a quantum is actually a teeny-tiny itsy-bitsy 
eeeny-weeny change. &nbsp;Similarly, in those news stories, the contribution of 
the Lone Genius Scientist is overplayed, forgetting about the legions of 
graduate students and postdocs who actually<em>do</em> the work, as well as the 
centuries of giants upon whose shoulders they all stand.</p> 
<p>For those who have read the twisted tale of my life thus far and how I got 
from being the youngest in my class to being the oldest in my class, finally 
finishing school (this time for sure!) at the tender age of 42, you&rsquo;ll 
know that I started life as a starry-eyed molecular biologist. &nbsp;I was 
going to cure cancer. &nbsp;Because although I knew intellectually that science 
was a lot of hard work and a very long process, some little part of me still 
held onto the magical belief that you had a brilliant idea on Monday, did the 
experiment on Tuesday, got data (cells gotta grow overnight) on Wednesday, 
published on Thursday, and on Friday were on the plane to Stockholm.</p> 
<p>It took literally ten years (four as an undergrad, during which I was 
involved in bench research almost all the way through, and six as a grad 
student), before I understood what this article is talking about, and realized 
that my extraverted novelty-loving big-picture-oriented but 
not-much-of-a-schmoozing personality was not a good fit for the real life of a 
scientist. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d be a good grantwriter, I suppose, but ugh, not what 
I want to actually do for a living.</p> 
<p>So my point in making this post? &nbsp;Gifted kids need career guidance. 
&nbsp;Early and often. &nbsp;So many of us are afflicted with &ldquo;the perils 
of multipotentiality&rdquo; &mdash; we can go in many different directions, we 
have many different interests and talents, we have many choices. 
&nbsp;Sometimes we foreclose too early, other times we wander without direction.
</p> 
<p>Very often what a field looks like when we&rsquo;re kids has very little to 
do with what it looks like when we&rsquo;re adult practitioners. &nbsp;And very 
often what a talented kid looks like when they&rsquo;re very young has very 
little to do with what an eminent and creative practitioner of the field is 
going to look like in adulthood. &nbsp;Knowing a lot of facts about science or 
having precocious math procedural skills (which is what precocious science-y 
math-y kids often manifest with) is a great&nbsp;<em>potentiator</em> of 
creative thought later in life, but it isn&rsquo;t the same thing. &nbsp;Some 
kids are just good at piling up facts.</p> 
<p>Reading biographies of famous individuals, particularly those written for 
younger audiences, doesn&rsquo;t help all that much, I&rsquo;m afraid. &nbsp; 
Those tend to contribute to the same misconceptions about heroism and 
breakthroughs and such. &nbsp;Same with having occasional visits in the 
classroom or one-time shadowing experiences &mdash; again, the focus tends to 
be on the gee-whiz aspects of the career, a sales job more than anything else.
</p> 
<p>Kids need real information about what those people really do all day, what 
the life is like, what personality characteristics and working styles are good 
fits for it (and which are not!). &nbsp;What I think is most helpful is for 
those kids to have ongoing mentor relationships with adults in the field, folks 
who will honestly answer questions and suggest routes by which kids can 
meaningfully explore and pursue their passions. &nbsp;They should also 
volunteer information that fell into a kid&rsquo;s blind spots, stuff they 
didn&rsquo;t even think to ask about. &nbsp;For example, my Little Bird, who 
wants to be a veterinarian, found out from her mentor that a huge part of the 
job is about dealing with<em>humans</em>, keeping the patients&rsquo; owners 
happy, because no cat ever brings themselves to the vet. &nbsp;Perhaps obvious 
in retrospect, but not obvious to a caring and empathic tween girl who loves 
animals and science. &nbsp;If a kid feels weird or intimidated about asking for 
a mentor, remind them that most people who are truly passionate about their 
careers also<em>love</em> to share that passion with others, <em>especially 
</em>young folks who might want to grow up to be like them.</p> 
<p>(side hint/plea &mdash; if you love your work, offer to mentor kids who are 
curious about it! &nbsp;Not every kid has easy access to a family friend who 
just happens to be in your field.)</p> 
<p>Mentors can also help link a kid up with long-term experiences where they 
can get their hands dirty and become part of the action, particularly as they 
move into the teen years. &nbsp;Trying something out, over a long enough time 
to get past the &ldquo;squeeeee!&rdquo; stage, is terrific. &nbsp;Worst case? 
&nbsp;The kid finds out that it&rsquo;s not what they thought it was and 
they&rsquo;d rather go in a different direction in the same field or pursue 
other passions entirely. &nbsp;Not such a bad worst case &mdash; better than 
finding it out six years into graduate school. &nbsp;Best case? &nbsp;The kid 
gets experience that both helps them understand the complexity of a field and, 
oh, by the way, looks great on applications.</p> 
<p>As an adjunct to learning about a career in depth, kids need to learn about 
<em>themselves.</em> Knowing about your own personal learning and working 
profile, in its many dimensions (subject for a future post), is important. 
&nbsp;There can be many different ways to be good at a profession, of course! 
&nbsp;But if you don&rsquo;t know what your own strengths and weaknesses are, 
you can neither think about how your current style might match up nor think 
intelligently about what you might want to develop about yourself in order to 
become a better match. &nbsp;Introspection can be a valuable tool for this 
&mdash; books like<em>What Color is Your Parachute? </em>(oh, look, 
there&rsquo;s a teen version &mdash; I haven&rsquo;t read it yet, but I&rsquo;d 
consider that a good bet as a starting point) can help structure some aspects 
of the exploration. &nbsp;It can also be helpful for kids to ask the adults in 
their lives to share their impressions &mdash; chances are good that no one 
vision of a kid will be perfectly accurate, but when diverse sources start to 
give convergent data, that&rsquo;s something to take seriously. &nbsp;Getting 
professional help (from a formal assessment, a therapy relationship, a career 
counselor familiar with gifted kids (i.e., who won&rsquo;t just say, 
&ldquo;Ooh, you&rsquo;re so wonderful, you can be anything you want to 
be!&rdquo;) can provide another helpful outside perspective.</p> 
<p>What else do people think would help kids make smart career choices?

<h2>school supplies&hellip; a&nbsp;rant</h2> August 4, 2010 Aimee Yermish 35 
comments <br>

<p>One of the things that I do a lot of with kids, especially kids in middle 
school or high school, is help them deal with the paper chase. We work together 
to develop and troubleshoot systems for corraling all those loose papers, 
books, notebooks, projects, etc. We&rsquo;re often doing this in whatever teeny 
bits of wiggle room we can find within the &ldquo;systems&rdquo; imposed upon 
them by their schools. Usually schools have good intentions in doing these 
&mdash; they&rsquo;re honestly trying to teach kids organizational skills. And, 
admittedly sometimes the systems are for the convenience of the teachers 
&mdash; e.g., they want to be able to collect notebooks and take them home to 
check that kids are doing their work. But usually the actual systems leave much 
to be desired.</p> 
<p>Well, my own beloved Little Bird is about to embark upon middle school (cue 
the scary music), and the good news is that she is pretty run-of-the-mill in 
terms of keeping track of stuff &mdash; no worse than most kids her age. Which 
is to say she&rsquo;s not very good at it.</p> 
<p>So when I look at her supply list, I&rsquo;m, well, a trifle concerned.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>2 double-pocket folders (note that these are designated for a specific 
subject, so they&rsquo;re<em>not </em>likely to be intended as general 
&ldquo;hot folders&rdquo; (for carrying homework and parent handouts back and 
forth), which might actually be a use, at least for one of them. But usually, 
the main purpose of pocket folders is to become overstuffed and to have papers 
fall out of them into a random and comical heap at inopportune moments. Usually 
when the kid is late for the bus.)</li> 
<li>1 three-ring binder, 1&Prime; thick, flexible, with some unspecified 
number of page protectors. It&rsquo;s important to stay flexible.</li> 
<li>2 three-ring binders, 1&Prime; thick, (one of which is noted as needing 
filler paper, the other is not. Was that a typo? Will they be writing only on 
worksheets? Or is there some very special papyrus to be purchased at a later 
date?)</li> 
<li>1 three-ring binder, 1.5&Prime; thick, with side pockets (because handouts 
fall out of them so much more easily than out of those pesky pocket folders), 
10 tab dividers, 25 sheets of lined paper, and 3 pens or pencils (for Health. 
Because I might have a heart attack trying to get this stuff organized.)</li> 
<li>1 three-ring binder, 2&Prime; thick, with lined paper and reinforcements 
(I do appreciate the foresight of the tech-ed teacher. With a list like this, 
we&rsquo;re definitely going to need to call for reinforcements at some point.)
</li> 
<li>4 single-subject spiral notebooks that measure 9&Prime;x11&Prime; (with, I 
kid you not, seven (7) reminders, four (4) of which are boldfaced and 
underlined, one (1) of which also has italics, to make sure you notice that 
they are requiring you to track down spirals that are actually 
9&Prime;x11&Prime; rather than 8.5&Prime;x11&Prime; or 8.5&Prime;x10.5&Prime;, 
despite the fact that these spirals are literally three times the cost of the 
normal ones and are considerably harder to find (yes, I found them, no need to 
send me a link)).</li> 
<li>1 Bienfang Notesketch 8.5&Prime;x11&Prime; Horizontal Lines (now 
there&rsquo;s an art teacher who knows what she wants. Okay, I can&rsquo;t be 
too mad about that. Hopefully it stays in the art room most of the time. 
&nbsp;But heaven forbid she could have asked for a similar item available at, 
oh, say, a big-box craft or office supply store, instead of requiring a special 
trip to an art store or paying expensive shipping for an online order)</li> 
<li>1 zippered pencil pouch (recommended) (I&rsquo;m wondering why they 
aren&rsquo;t requiring it. Perhaps because no one other than the Health teacher 
thinks they need writing implements. Or perhaps because backpacks usually have 
appropriately-sized pockets, so pencil pouches are superfluous.)</li> 
<li>1 flash drive (good idea! Let me suggest also a lanyard or other device to 
permanently<em>attach </em>said flash drive to the kid&rsquo;s backpack? 
Otherwise, in the office pool for the lifespan of that object, put me down for 
&ldquo;under one week.&rdquo;)</li> 
<li>1 mini stapler (Why? Because teachers aren&rsquo;t going to hit the 
&ldquo;staple&rdquo; button on the photocopier? Because classrooms can&rsquo;t 
have a single shared stapler anymore so kids can learn to take turns? Because 
the pencil pouch might be lonely without any pencils in it?)</li> 
<li>1 glue stick (Ah, now I&rsquo;m wondering if this is the crucial piece to 
their cunning plan &mdash; those oversized spiral-bounds could easily be chosen 
so that every we&rsquo;re-going-green-single-side-printed handout can be 
meticulously glued in place! If so, we need a<em>case</em> of glue sticks. And 
some antacid.)</li> 
<li>&lt;singing&gt; and a partridge in a pear tree.&lt;/singing&gt; &nbsp;Yes, 
they do note that additional items may be added during the school year as 
needed.</li> </ul> 
<p>Note that this is all before we add any <em>textbooks</em> to those 
backpacks, if you were concerned about weight.</p> 
<p>Okay, to be fair, I&rsquo;m willing to guess that a couple of those binders 
might be destined to live in classrooms instead of traveling back and forth to 
lockers and home.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m noticing what&rsquo;s <em>not </em>on the list, too&hellip; No 
mechanical pencils. No colored pens or pencils. No graph paper for either math 
or science. &nbsp;No actual hot-folder.</p> 
<p>And no planner. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get lucky and they <em>won&rsquo;t </em>
hand out a paper planner they&rsquo;re expecting everyone to use. And maybe 
they&rsquo;ll be okay letting her use an electronic PDA.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, this isn&rsquo;t a school that has gotten all security-crazed 
to the point where they don&rsquo;t allow backpacks or tote bags. No kidding 
&mdash; I&rsquo;ve had to write into kids&rsquo; IEPs and 504 plans that they 
had to be<em>allowed</em> to use a bag instead of carrying everything loose.</p>
<p>But this list is not giving me all the warm fuzzy back-to-school feeling 
I&rsquo;m hoping for. It has too many moving parts. Too much empty air and 
paper being carried around. Too much labor involved in routine use.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not a plan for success. It&rsquo;s a plan for lost and crumpled 
papers, shoveddeep into the recesses of the backpack until they turn into 
petroleum products. It&rsquo;s a plan for disintegrating or overflowing 
notebooks which then must be laboriously recreated. It&rsquo;s a plan for 
oh-so-many last-minute crises when the eldritch horrors that live in 
kids&rsquo; lockers have mysteriously hidden the items they needed to do their 
homework so that the kid wasn&rsquo;t able to rescue them before dashing out to 
the bus. Oy.</p> 
<p>Of course, by sheer random chance, some kids in this school will manage 
this system okay. And some other kids will have parental or professional 
support called into play so as to prevent the worst of the failure. But that 
just gives the illusion that these systems work. Which then is used to justify 
blaming kids who can&rsquo;t make them work (&ldquo;not trying hard 
enough&rdquo; or even &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>See, you can&rsquo;t teach kids organizational skills just by putting them 
in a situation where organizational skills would be a Really Good Idea. You 
also can&rsquo;t teach organizational skills by imposing a system that is 
complex and onerous enough that kids need you to direct them every inch of the 
way. You need to be in the middle ground, where some guidance will help them 
gradually become able to do it on their own.</p> 
<p>Normally, this district actually does a pretty good job with most things, 
and even a very good job with some things. &nbsp;Birdie likes school and I 
think she&rsquo;s getting a good education. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m frankly surprised 
to see this list, and I hope that I&rsquo;m wrong about some of my conjectures. 
&nbsp;But even if this is actually a well-thought-out system that I&rsquo;m 
just totally misconstruing, I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of you out there 
who are about to be struggling with a school-imposed organizational nightmare.
</p> 
<p>In &lt;a

post,&lt;/a&gt; I&rsquo;ll talk about the system I usually start with &mdash; 
it works pretty well for most kids who struggle with organization.</p>

<h2>Oh, no, my kid might be gifted! Where do I&nbsp;start?</h2> August 3, 2010 
Aimee Yermish 17 comments <br>

<p>This is perhaps the most common reason people call me.&nbsp; Maybe they 
always assumed that their kids would be gifted, but had also assumed that there 
would be clear and easy guidance and help available from the school 
system.&nbsp; Or maybe giftedness just wasn&rsquo;t on their radar, but a 
pediatrician or teacher or relative or someone else said something.&nbsp; 
Either way, they started web-searching, and quickly found themselves confused 
and overwhelmed &mdash; there is so much information, so much jargon, all the 
information is contradictory, and so much of it is, well, highly opinionated.
</p> 
<p>[Okay, so I&rsquo;m probably no exception to the &ldquo;highly 
opinionated&rdquo; thing, but I try not to go off the, &ldquo;Your kid is a 
super-special superior being,&rdquo; or the, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t do this 
One Right Thing and you don&rsquo;t do it Right Now, you&rsquo;re not taking 
proper care of your child,&rdquo; deep ends.&nbsp; If I do, please don&rsquo;t 
hesitate to call me on it.]</p> 
<p>But let me give you a few simple things to do.</p> 
<p>First, breathe.&nbsp; Your kid is wonderful and terrific and you are 
feeling the same awesome responsibility as the custodian of a young life as all 
good parents do.&nbsp; But, as I tell my own kids, unless something is bleeding 
or on fire, chances are good that this isn&rsquo;t an emergency.&nbsp; I do get 
some emergency-type calls (school is in the process of throwing a kid out, kid 
is emotionally falling apart on a regular basis, etc.), and if that&rsquo;s the 
kind of situation you&rsquo;re in, absolutelysend me a note or give me a call 
and I&rsquo;ll talk you through.</p> 
<p>But otherwise, relax.&nbsp; Your kid is the same kid they were yesterday 
and is the same kid they&rsquo;re going to be tomorrow.&nbsp; A day or a week 
or a month here or there isn&rsquo;t going to make the difference between a 
fulfilling life of scholarship, career, and love, and a kid who crashes and 
burns and ends up on Skid Row.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s okay to take the time to get 
your bearings.&nbsp; And few decisions are truly permanent &mdash; you can 
usually change course later.</p> 
<p>Okay.&nbsp; There are a lot of books written about gifted kids and how to 
parent them.&nbsp; I frankly don&rsquo;t think that parents (who are probably 
pretty smart themselves!) need to read every book out there &mdash; 
there&rsquo;s not going to be that much new information once you&rsquo;ve read 
one.&nbsp; My current go-to book &mdash; it&rsquo;s comprehensive, realistic, 
calm, not worshipful or overblown or dismissive &mdash; is&nbsp;Webb, J.T., 
Gore, J.L., Amend, E.R., &amp; DeVries, A.R. (2007). &nbsp;A parent&rsquo;s 
guide to gifted children. &nbsp;Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for some specific suggestions for curricula, toys, 
books, contests, local groups, you name it, go toHoagies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolyn K 
curates probably the largest single pile of links to All Things Gifted.&nbsp; 
You name it, it&rsquo;s probably already there.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s not, tell 
Carolyn, and she&rsquo;ll add it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the easiest site to 
browse through, just because there&rsquo;s so much of it &mdash; use the search 
tool liberally. &nbsp;Hoagies also has a wealth of articles with every possible 
opinion on every possible topic, but chances are good that&rsquo;s what got you 
overwhelmed in the first place (grin).</p> 
<p>One very strong theme in the research literature on giftedness is the idea 
of social isolation, both for kids and for parents. &nbsp;Yeah, you. 
&nbsp;Giftedness is treated with a lot of ambivalence in the USA and similar 
cultures &mdash; you&rsquo;re supposed to have brilliant kids, but whatever you 
do, Don&rsquo;t Talk About Them. &nbsp;The single best thing parents can do for 
themselves is to break the isolation. &nbsp;If you go to Hoagies (of course), 
there is a list of mailing lists and ways to get in contact with other parents:
http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/on-line_support.htm. &nbsp;What I usually 
recommend is to subscribe to GT-Families and TAGFAM, two general-interest 
mailing lists. &nbsp;Volume can be high at times &mdash; try using your mail 
program to sort messages into a folder, and if you get behind by a week or 
more, don&rsquo;t feel bad about deleting. &nbsp;There are also related lists 
for&nbsp;parents of kids who are twice-exceptional, homeschooling, radically 
accelerated, etc. &nbsp;The lists are *very* helpful for parents to get advice 
and feedback from each other, and even just to have a place to talk about what 
they&rsquo;re going through without being assumed to be bragging.</p> 
<p>The GT universe is also moving into social media &mdash; many of the major 
players have Facebook pages (you can find minehere), blogs, Twitter accounts, 
etc. &nbsp;Hoagies again is a great one to follow, and allow yourself to bop 
around and enjoy the variety of viewpoints. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have favorites 
yet in this realm &mdash; it&rsquo;s changing too fast.</p> 
<p>Another great organization is Supporting the Emotional Needs of the Gifted
:&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides having some very goodarticles on the social-emotional 
experience of giftedness, they train facilitators to run local parent support 
groups. &nbsp;Very helpful for breaking the isolation and processing 
one&rsquo;s own experiences of growing up gifted. &nbsp;Hint: the kid 
didn&rsquo;t just fall out of the sky that way&hellip;</p> 
<p>There is a National Association of Gifted Children, and every state has an 
association. &nbsp;Associations vary widely in terms of what they actually 
provide &mdash; my experience has been that they are more focused around 
political advocacy than around direct service to parents or kids. &nbsp;You can 
find a list of the state associations onthat same Hoagies page.</p> 
<p>Many parents who call me are looking to find out about what their school 
districts are obligated to do. &nbsp;You can find a complete listing of state 
laws affecting gifted kids atGenius Denied. &nbsp;The title might lead you to 
think that it&rsquo;s a pretty depressing listing, and you&rsquo;d be right. 
&nbsp;Sigh.</p> 
<p>Along with that, by the way, if you think your child might be 
twice-exceptional, or if you live in a state where gifted education is handled 
through the special education process, the place to go isWrightslaw.</p> 
<p>There are many state and regional talent searches; find the ones serving 
your location on the Hoagies&nbsp;Talent Search page. All offer low-cost 
methods for kids to take out-of-level achievement tests (because they&rsquo;d 
hit the ceilings of grade-level achievement tests, of course!), qualifying them 
to take courses designed for gifted kids. &nbsp;Courses can be expensive but 
financial aid is available. &nbsp;The courses are generally terrific, and the 
chance to be with other gifted kids is one that many kids treasure. &nbsp;If 
nothing else, having a qualifying score on these is a cheap-and-easy way to get 
something objective in hand that you can share with your child&rsquo;s district 
when they say, &ldquo;Oh, we have lots of kids just like that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>To learn about what the research actually says about the various different 
forms of academic acceleration, you can download theA Nation Deceived report 
for free. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s from three of the leading researchers in gifted 
education, and, as the title might suggest, most of what educators think they 
know just isn&rsquo;t so. &nbsp;They typically get<em>zero</em> training in 
gifted issues while in teacher school, and what they do get typically just 
perpetuates the myths. &nbsp;And don&rsquo;t worry about that 
&ldquo;social-emotional&rdquo; thing, or the one story they can tell you about 
the kid who accelerated and was miserable &mdash; the most important 
social-emotional need for gifted kids is appropriate academic challenge and 
real peers.</p> 
<p>The best single book to share with teachers is:&nbsp;Winebrenner, S. 
(2001). &nbsp;Teaching gifted kids in the regular classroom: Strategies and 
techniques every teacher can use to meet the academic needs of the gifted and 
talented(2nd. ed). &nbsp;Minneapolis, MN: Free Spirit Publishing. &nbsp;She 
talks about how to actually implement techniques like curriculum compacting 
(test out of what you already know), differentiated lesson plans (have 
different kids do different things on the same topic), and independent 
projects, without spending lots of money or putting forth enormous effort. 
&nbsp;There&rsquo;s even a companion CD-ROM with customizable forms for the 
teachers to use.</p> 
<p>Because we need to break the social isolation of the kids, too, I also 
strongly recommend sharing with administrators if they&rsquo;ll let you: 
&nbsp;Winebrenner, S., &amp; Brulles, D. (2008). &nbsp;The cluster grouping 
handbook: A schoolwide model: How to challenge gifted students and improve 
achievement for all. Minneapolis, MN: Free Spirit Publishing. &nbsp;In cluster 
grouping, instead of spreading the gifted kids out among all classes in a grade 
(which seems &ldquo;fair&rdquo; to the teachers, but makes it very hard for the 
gifted kids to find each other), they get put in groups of about 5-6 kids 
within a few classrooms. &nbsp;This costs<em>nothing</em> to implement, and not 
only does the book tell a principal how and why, it even includes sample 
letters to help manage the political stuff around it.</p> 
<p>If you are considering a whole-grade acceleration (grade skip), check out 
the&nbsp;Iowa Acceleration Scales, 3rd edition. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a 
research-based measure designed to help parents and administrators talk in a 
holistic fashion about a kid when making placement decisions. &nbsp;If 
you&rsquo;re talking with administrators about district-wide acceleration 
policy (hey, a girl can dream, eh?) theInstitute for Research and Policy on 
Acceleration has guidelines. &nbsp;Both of these are from the same folks as 
Nation Deceived.</p> 
<p>If a kid has IQ and achievement scores both above 145, there are some great 
opportunities available through theDavidson Institute for Talent Development. 
&nbsp;Consultation, financial support, classes for kids and parents, all sorts 
of nice stuff. &nbsp;Even if the child is not eligible (I always have to remind 
people who come to me for testing that by the math of the normal curve, 96% of 
kids above 130 are *not* above 145), DITD has somepublic-access bulletin boards 
with useful information and discussions as well, and adatabase of articles on 
specific topics.</p> 
<p>That should get you started. &nbsp;If you need more help, ask me, ask on 
the mailing lists, ask on the bboards, ask wherever, and you&rsquo;ll get lots 
of help. &nbsp;Typically, folks introduce their questions with, &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t know if anyone has ever had this happen, but&hellip;&rdquo; and 
everyone says, &ldquo;Oh, no, we&rsquo;ve all had that happen, here&rsquo;s the 
different ways we dealt with it.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sure, you&rsquo;ll probably end 
up with way too many ideas, and you&rsquo;ll hear all sorts of, er, very strong 
opinions. &nbsp;Remember that I&rsquo;m here giving you permission to relax, 
take a breath, work with the school, don&rsquo;t give up, accept that you 
don&rsquo;t have to find a perfect solution right away, and that there&rsquo;s 
no one right way to do anything.</p> Categories: getting started Tags:

<h2>Hello,&nbsp;world!</h2> July 25, 2010 Aimee Yermish 13 comments <br>

<p>Well, now that I&rsquo;ve finally graduated and don&rsquo;t have papers and 
a dissertation to write, I&rsquo;m ready to start actually writing more for the 
general public. &nbsp;I tend to have opinions on giftedness, learning 
disabilities, education, psychology, and the interface between all of those. 
&nbsp;I have particular expertise in cognitive, academic, and psychological 
assessment, the psychological and social effects of high intelligence, theories 
of intelligence and personality, and the real world of various educational 
strategies. &nbsp;I believe that most questions are far more complex and 
nuanced than most people give them credit for, and that it&rsquo;s important to 
think in a rigorous way about the ramifications of various ideas. &nbsp;So I 
tend to be in the mode of Blaise Pascal&rsquo;s famous quote (often attributed 
to Mark Twain), &ldquo;I wrote you a long letter, because I didn&rsquo;t have 
time to write you a short letter.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Some readers might be new to the whole giftedness thing, and might be 
overwhelmed. &nbsp;I get a lot of phone calls and emails that amount to, 
&ldquo;Help! &nbsp;How do I get started?&rdquo; &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll try to tag 
things in terms of whether something is a general-interest post (or even a GT 
101 FAQ), or whether I think it&rsquo;s mostly going to be of interest to the 
folks who are as geeky as I am.</p> 
<p>I love to hear suggestions from people about specific topics or questions 
they&rsquo;d like me to address, so feel free to comment here or to send me a 
private email (aimee@davincilearning.org). &nbsp;I also like suggestions on how 
I can more effectively use this or other online forums &mdash; despite having 
been on the net for over 25 years (!), I tend not to be a particularly rapid 
adopter of the new and shiny.</p> Categories: getting started Tags: introduction
