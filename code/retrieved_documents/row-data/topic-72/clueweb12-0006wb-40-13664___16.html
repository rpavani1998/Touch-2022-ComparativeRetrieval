<h2>Small Steps for Eating More Fruits and Veggies </h2> 
<p><strong>Why Fruits and Vegetables?</strong></p> 
<p> Did you know that eating more fruits and vegetables will help prevent and 
manage many health conditions? Your risk for heart disease, diabetes, high 
blood pressure, some cancers, and weight issues can be decreased just by 
increasing fruits and vegetables.</p> 
<h3><strong>Easy Ways to Include Fruits and Vegetables Into Your Day</strong>
</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Microwave frozen vegetables such as broccoli, peas, or green beans for an 
easy side dish dinner.</li> 
<li>Eat more colors!&nbsp; (red peppers, purple grapes, green apples, white 
cauliflower and oranges).</li> 
<li>Add frozen vegetables such as broccoli, peas, and carrots to soups and 
stews.</li> 
<li>Add vegetables to casseroles, stews, rice dishes, or spaghetti sauces.</li>
<li>Slice bananas, canned peaches, or frozen berries on cereal, or add to 
yogurt.</li> 
<li>Add lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers carrots, spinach or onions to sandwiches.
</li> 
<li>Cut raw veggies such as carrots, celery, and pepper strips into sticks and 
store in the refrigerator Add a healthy dip for a quick snack.</li> 
<li>Add a variety of vegetables to pizza.&nbsp; Pepper, onions and tomatoes 
are just a few choices.</li> 
<li>Encourage your child to choose their own fruit when shopping.</li> 
<li>Instead of eating French fries, bake or microwave a sweet potato.</li> 
<li>Make a fruit salad for dessert.</li> 
<li> Try fun snacks like fresh fruit dipped in fruit yogurt.</li> 
<li> Enjoy baked chips with salsa.</li> 
<li>Fill up on fewer calories; add lettuce, tomatoes, and other vegetables to 
your sandwich and leave off the cheese.</li> 
<li>Try a new fruit or vegetable recipe every week.</li> 
<li>Try a side salad with low fat dressing instead of fries and save over 200 
calories.</li> 
<li>Dried fruits make a great snack.</li> </ul> 
<p>Return to Top</p> 
<h2>How to store leftovers</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Put leftovers in the fridge as soon as possible, but definitely within 2 
hours of cooking. If you leave leftovers out for too long at room temperature, 
bacteria can quickly multiply, turning your delightful dish into a food 
poisoning disaster.</li> 
<li>Store leftovers in containers with lids that can be snapped tightly shut. 
Bowls or tins are OK for storing leftovers, but be sure to cover them tightly 
with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to keep the food from drying out.</li> 
<li>Store large amounts of leftovers in several small shallow containers 
instead of one large container. This allows the food to cool faster and is also 
easier to heat up.</li> 
<li>Eat any leftovers within 3 to 5 days or freeze them. <strong>Don't</strong>
 freeze any dishes that contain uncooked fruit or veggies, hard-cooked eggs, or 
mayonnaise.</li> 
<li>Eat frozen leftovers within 2 months. </li> 
<li>If you're freezing leftovers, freeze them in one- or two-portion servings, 
so they'll be easy to take out of the freezer, pop in the microwave, and eat.
</li> 
<li>Don't fill storage bowls all the way to the top; when food is frozen, it 
expands. Leave a little extra space - about 1/2 inch (about 13 millimeters) 
should do it.</li> </ul>

<h2>School lunches your kids will love</h2> 
<p><strong>What is a healthy lunch?&nbsp;</strong>Cut fruits and/or veggies, 
lean meat or peanut-butter sandwiches on whole-grain bread, low or nonfat dairy 
products.</p> 
<p><strong>Portion size </strong>is important when planning lunches and 
recipes for your children. Here's a general guide for grade school lunch 
portion sizes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Two to three ounces of lean meat and cheese </li> 
<li>One or two slices of bread OR 1/2 cup grain or rice </li> 
<li>One to two different fruits or vegetables </li> 
<li>1 cup milk or 6-8 oz yogurt&nbsp;(make sure dairy is low-fat) </li> </ul> 
<h3>Some ideas</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Sandwiches: lean cold cuts such as turkey or ham, with a slice of cheese 
on whole grain bread, topped with spinach, lettuce, tomato, or other veggies
</li> 
<li>Peanut butter and jelly on whole grain bread </li> 
<li>Tuna fish sandwich on whole grain bread </li> 
<li>Wraps made with whole wheat tortillas, containing either lean cold cuts or 
cheese slices topped with veggie slices</li> 
<li>Quesadilla slices made with cheese and chicken or vegetables </li> 
<li>Cold strips of grilled chicken with honey mustard dip </li> 
<li>Trail mix made with cereals, nuts, pretzels, dried fruit or raisins, and a 
few chocolate morsels</li> 
<li>Low-fat yogurt with berries or try soy yogurt if lactose intolerant </li> 
<li>Low fat cheese spread on whole wheat crackers </li> 
<li>Low fat cheese cubes or low-fat cottage cheese </li> 
<li>Individual serving-sized packages of low fat yogurt, cottage cheese, or 
yogurt smoothies</li> 
<li>For the vegetarian: mini-burritos made with rice and black beans or 
low-fat refried beans in a tortilla with tomato salsa (heated or eaten cold)
</li> 
<li>Whole wheat pitas stuffed with fresh vegetables and hummus or cheese </li> 
<li>Baked chips, soy crisps, or pretzels are a better choice than regular 
potato chips or cheese puffs</li> 
<li>Water or drinks made with water and a splash of cranberry, peach, grape, 
or other 100% fruit juice are healthier than sodas</li> 
<li>Low-fat milk </li> 
<li>Homemade air-popped popcorn flavored with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese 
is healthier than most pre-packaged or microwave popcorn.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Fruits and Vegetables</h3> 
<p>Children will more likely eat their fruit and veggies when they are cut up 
or already small in size.&nbsp; Some ideas:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Slices of apple with peanut butter </li> 
<li>Cherries, kiwi slices, orange slices, cut up melon, berries </li> 
<li>Pineapple chunks with low-fat cottage cheese </li> 
<li>Seedless grapes </li> 
<li>Fruit salad </li> 
<li>Fruit leathers </li> 
<li>Single portion-sized cups of unsweetened apple sauce or fruit without 
added sugar or syrup</li> 
<li>Baby carrots with hummus or low-fat dip </li> 
<li>Cut up bell peppers, broccoli, and cauliflower are good for dipping in a 
low-fat ranch dip</li> 
<li>Celery sticks with low-fat dip or peanut butter&nbsp; </li> 
<li>Cherry tomatoes </li> 
<li>Top sandwiches with spinach or lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, sprouts, 
onions</li> </ul> 
<h3>Juice</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;Make sure it is 100% juice and give less than 12 oz in a day.</p> 
<h3>Pre-packaged items</h3> 
<p>Keep in mind that prepackaged lunches you can buy in the grocery store are 
convenient, but are often higher in calories, fat, sugar and sodium then meals 
that you prepare yourself. They are also usually more expensive.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Tip</h3> 
<p>Have children make a list of their favorite foods from each major food 
group: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy and lean meat. Have them choose 
at least one food from the list each day.&nbsp; By giving them a choice, it's 
more likely they'll actually eat the lunch.</p>

<h2>Tips for Eating at Restaurants</h2> 
<p><b>1. Avoid buffets</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>All-you-can-eat buffets lead to overeating. </li> </ul> 
<p><b>2. Stick to the light menu/Make careful menu selections</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Many restaurants indicate healthy choices on their menus, and most 
sit-down places will modify menu items at your request.</li> 
<li>If you don't know what's in a dish or don't know the serving size, ask.
</li> 
<li>Main courses which have been baked, broiled, roasted, poached or steamed 
will be healthier than anything fried.</li> 
<li>Salads with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables and light dressings will 
be better than salads with croutons, cheeses, meats and heavy dressings.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>3. Don't be afraid to special order</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ask for your vegetables and main dishes to be served without the sauces. 
</li> 
<li>Ask if things are fried or cooked in oil or butter &ndash; if they are, 
see if you can order them baked, roasted, or steamed with less added fat.</li> 
<li>Instead of French fries, request a double order of a vegetable or a side 
salad.&nbsp; If you can't get a substitute, just ask that the high-fat food be 
left off your plate.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Order a fruit cup for an appetizer or the breakfast melon for 
dessert.&nbsp; Instead of a dinner entree, combine a salad with a low-fat 
appetizer.</li> 
<li>Many restaurants are happy to accommodate your requests.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>4. Watch portion size</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>At a typical restaurant, a single serving provides enough calories for at 
least two meals.</li> 
<li>If it is possible, order a smaller portion (often called &lsquo;half 
sizes').</li> 
<li>If you can't order smaller portions, it is a good rule of thumb to leave 
at least one-third to one-half of the meal on your plate.</li> 
<li>Or, separate your meal before you start eating (you can even ask for a 
to-go container right away).</li> </ul> 
<p><b>5. Share</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sharing entrees, appetizers and desserts with dining partners is a great 
idea. It allows you to sample something that you really want to have while also 
helping you avoid the temptation to overindulge.</li> 
<li>If you are sharing with a friend or your partner, your portion size is 
automatically reduced and there is less available to eat.</li> 
<li>It is still important to make good menu choices, but sharing might make 
dessert (or something else indulgent) more of an option.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>6. Order sauce and dressing on the side</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you ask for sauces and dressings on the side, you can control the 
amount that you eat.</li> 
<li>Often you can use less than is normally used and still enjoy the same 
taste.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>7. Remember the big picture</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Think of eating out in the context of your whole diet. If it is a special 
occasion or a fun social event and you know you want to order your favorite 
meal at a nice restaurant, cut back on your earlier meals that day.</li> 
<li>Moderation is always key, but planning ahead can help you relax and enjoy 
your dining out experience without sacrificing good nutrition or diet control.

<h2>Eating On-the-Go</h2> 
<h3>Breakfast</h3> 
<p>Many of us skip breakfast because we do not have time to prepare a meal. 
But breakfast offers us energy to get through the morning. Those who eat 
breakfast are better able to concentrate at work and school and are less likely 
overeat at other meals. Here are some examples of quick, healthy choices for a 
breakfast on-the-go.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Grab a fruit cup or fresh fruit pieces.</li> 
<li>Keep a supply of low fat granola bars and trail mix handy.</li> 
<li>Mix low fat plain or vanilla yogurt with fresh fruit or cereal (like 
raisin bran or low fat granola).</li> 
<li>Stuff half a whole wheat pita with low fat cottage cheese and sliced 
peaches, pears, or banana.</li> 
<li>Top a raisin or whole grain bagel with fat free cream cheese and thin 
apple slices.</li> 
<li>Combine 1/4 cup low fat ricotta cheese with apple sauce and dash of 
cinnamon. Sprinkle a whole grain cereal on top.</li> 
<li>Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter on whole wheat bread and wrap it around 
a banana.</li> 
<li>Spread 2 tablespoons of hummus on pumpernickel bread.</li> 
<li>Blend 1/4 cup each of plain low fat yogurt and orange juice with 1/4 a 
banana and a few frozen berries.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Lunch and Dinner</h3> 
<p>Whether we are driving between meetings, squeezing in a 30 minute lunch 
break or racing between kids&rsquo; after school events, there are days that we 
need to eat a meal on-the-go. Here are some helpful hints for making better 
choices:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Expand your definition of fast food: deli sandwiches or wraps with lean 
meat (no cheese, no mayonnaise), burritos (no cheese, no sour cream), Greek 
Kebobs or pitas, and Chinese steamed vegetables with brown rice (ask for low 
sodium soy sauce) are tasty, convenient alternatives to the usual burgers and 
fries.</li> 
<li>At the deli or sub shop choose lean beef, ham, turkey or chicken on whole 
grain bread. Ask that only half of the normal amount of meat is put on your 
sandwich.</li> 
<li>Boost the nutrients in all kinds of sandwiches by adding tomato, lettuce, 
peppers, and other vegetables.</li> 
<li>Supermarkets are also a great alternative to fast food chains. Get a fresh 
sandwich at the deli counter or grab soup and salad at the salad bar.</li> 
<li>Pizza with tomato sauce, vegetable toppings, and low fat cheese is a great 
treat for adults and kids.</li> 
<li>Do not add a sugary, calorie-rich drink to your meal. Water is available 
everywhere and is good for you. You can also try skim or low fat milk or 
unsweetened iced tea instead of soda.</li> </ul> 
<p>Sometimes fast food chains are unavoidable. But we can still choose to make 
better food selections. Here are some tips to choosing the best meals at fast 
food restaurants:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Start by visiting fast food websites. All the major chains post nutrition 
information for their menu items on the website. Look at what you usually order 
and see if you can find some better choices. Compare calories, fat, sodium and 
fiber.</li> 
<li>Order the regular or kid-size portion. Mega-sized servings are most likely 
more than you need.</li> 
<li>Always order a side salad. You will be less likely to fill up on only the 
unhealthy items.</li> 
<li>Fried breaded chicken sandwiches are actually higher in fat and calories 
than a burger. Grilled chicken is the best option.</li> 
<li>Say no to special sauces, cheese, mayonnaise, and bacon. They only pack on 
calories, fat, and cholesterol.</li> 
<li>Pick a baked potato (hold the sour cream) instead of French fries. French 
fries do not count as a vegetable serving and are very high in fat.</li> 
<li>What to look for:</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Grilled, broiled or steamed</li> 
<li>Regular or junior size</li> 
<li>Low or non fat dressing </li> 
<li>Fresh vegetables and salads</li> 
<li>Unsweetened drinks</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>Snacks</h3> 
<p>Snacks can be a source of extra calories throughout the day but they can 
also be a way to fit in healthy foods. Stock your car with bottled water and 
healthy snacks. Have a small snack before the cravings hit and you are less 
likely to pull into a fast food chain. Knowing what snacks are healthy and 
nutritious is important.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tuck portable nonperishable foods in your purse, briefcase or backpack for 
on-the-go snacking. Some examples are:</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Dried fruit</li> 
<li>Whole grain, trans fat free crackers</li> 
<li>Whole grain cereal</li> 
<li>Fig bars</li> 
<li>Low fat granola</li> 
<li>Fresh fruit</li> 
<li>100% juice boxes</li> 
<li>Nuts</li> 
<li>Peanut butter crackers</li> 
<li>Raw vegetables</li> 
<li>Rice cakes</li> 
<li>Raisin bread</li> 
<li>Trail mix</li> </ul> 
<li>Fresh fruit is already packaged to go and always a convenient, nutritious 
snack.</li> 
<li>Stock up on snack foods while grocery shopping: cottage cheese, yogurt, 
minicarrots (peeled and washed), precut vegetables, fresh fruit.</li> 
<li>Supermarkets can also serve as a fast food break while on-the-go. Look for 
low fat dairy snacks, fresh vegetables and fruits, a small salad, or soup. 
&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
