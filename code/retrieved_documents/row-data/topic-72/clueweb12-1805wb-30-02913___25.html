<h4>What is this Resource?</h4> 
<p>This document was prepared by Sumant Murugesh, Tim Bell and Vanja Venrooy 
at the University of Canterbury. It is not an official document, but is offered 
as an evolving guide to the resources that are available for teaching the new 
material in NCEA Digital Technologies (currently focussed on the Programming 
and Computer Science strand). The structure has been based on various versions 
of the Body of Knowledge, proposed Standards, and Teaching and Learning guide; 
the material comes from an extensive search for relevant resources. It is our 
hope that this resource will evolve based on feedback from teachers, and 
ultimately end up as teaching plans that are built on the resources. Feedback 
can be sent to tim.bell [at] canterbury.ac.nz.</p> 
<p><strong>Achievement Standard<br>
</strong>The resources on this page relate 
mostly to the Digital Technologies Achievement Standard 1.44/AS91074 
(Demonstrate understanding of basic concepts from computer science)</p> 
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br>
Demonstrate an understanding of the 
distinguishing concepts ofalgorithms and programming languages from Computer 
Science and Software Engineering</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Understand what a programming language is and the role and characteristics 
ofprogramming languages</li> 
<li>Understand programming language concepts such as high level languages, 
machine languages, interpretation and compilation</li> 
<li>Explain the need for programs to translate between high and low level 
languages</li> 
<li>Compare and contrast programming languages, natural languages and high and 
low level languages</li> 
<li>Explain the ways in which high level languages are translated into machine 
languages</li> 
<li>Understand the concept that programming languages are precise</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Context</strong><br>
The key thing at this level is to be able to 
understand the need for programming languages to be able to communicate with a 
computer and program a task. An introduction could be done by looking at the 
history of programming languages (e.g.How did we get here? A brief history of 
OOP). Students can try to write simple programs using some form of structured 
English (Deb Sweeney's Peanut Butter and Jelly Programming). To demonstrate the 
concept that programming languages are precise, try lesson plans such as
Computers only do what they are told or the CS Unplugged activity in 
programming languages. For introducing low level languages, tryLow Level 
Languages as a guide.</p> 
<p><strong>Ideas for Teaching and Learning Activities</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Compare the speed of the same program being run on compiled and 
interpreted systems</li> 
<li>Download and install an open source application from a web repository, 
compare the different versions provided (source vs various precompiled 
versions), and explore the differences between high level languages, low level 
languages, and machine language, including issues such as size, portability and 
ease of installation.</li> 
<li>If students are concurrently working on programming, a discussion of the 
programming environment they are using can lead to a discussion of compiling, 
interpreting, and the different kinds of languages.</li> </ul>

the above resources that relates to this standard is attached as aPDF at the 
bottom of this resource page.</p> 
<h4>Comprehensive list of resources that relate to this standard</h4> 
<p>The resources below are a mixture that were developed for a varied audience 
ranging from high school students to university undergraduates, therefore we 
have attempted to classify the resources in terms of their readiness to be used 
by teachers. There are those that aim to convey a Basic understanding of the 
concepts and those that are Advanced and therefore might assist teachers with 
their professional development activities.</p>

</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Trevor Gosbell (at PC Update Online) has two excellent articles:<br>

<ol> 
<li>Eight Things Programming Languages Can Do Part 1 (April 2004): This 
article illustrates eight basic programming concepts with examples in five 
programming languages: Java, Perl, Python, REBOL and Scheme. It will enable the 
reader to make comparisons and generalisations. Part one addresses the first 
five ideas: output, variables, expressions, input, and selection. Part two 
covers lists, subroutines, and repetition.</li> 
<li>Eight Things Programming Languages Can Do Part 2 (May 2004): The above 
ideas will be extended further in looking at lists, subroutines, and repetition.
</li> </ol> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Wolfram R&ouml;sler has compiled a large collection of the very simple 
&quot;Hello World&quot; program in almost all known programming languages on 
the planet (428 languages at the time of this publication) inThe Hello World 
Collection.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>99 Bottles of Beer website is a collection of the Song 99 Bottles of Beer 
programmed in different programming languages. Actually the song is represented 
in 1348 different programming languages and variations.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Trabb Pardo&ndash;Knuth Algorithm (TPK Algorithm) is a program introduced 
byDonald Knuth and Luis Trabb Pardo to illustrate the evolution of computer 
programming languages. Note: The TPK algorithm reads in an array of 11 values, 
applies a particular function to each value, and then writes the result in 
reverse order.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present 
solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to 
demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a 
grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another. Rosetta Code 
currently has 413 tasks, and covers numerous languages, though we do not (and 
cannot) have solutions to every task in every language.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Mitch Fincher has the Rosetta Stone for a Few Languages. This is another 
great site with code samples of languages such as Ruby,C#, Java, JavaScript, 
Perl, PowerShell, Tcl/Tk, C++, Lisp, PHP.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Ryan Stansifer's TPK Algorithm in Different Programming Languages site 
shows this simple algorithm written in several modern languages. Note: TheTrabb 
Pardo&ndash;Knuth Algorithm (TPK Algorithm) reads in an array of 11 values, 
applies a particular function to each value, and then writes the result in 
reverse order.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Patrick Jordan has a A Very Quick Comparison of Popular Languages for 
Teaching Computer Programming, where he looked at what was involved in writing

<p><strong>Classroom Activities and Games: Basic Resources</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>CS Unplugged Activity 12 &ndash; Programming Languages</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>An engaging extension of the Marching Orders activity, developed by the 
PINY team in Seoul, Korea. As well as introducing programming, it exposes 
students to the idea of open-source development, and also programming language 
design.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Teach ICT UK has a poster that can used as a simple activity to guess which 
programming language called &lsquo;What am I&rsquo; in the classroom.</p> </li> 
<li>Paul Gray has developed a kinesthetic activity called Square Chicken Dance 
 to illustrate the idea of the single-instruction, multiple data style of 
parallelism using message passing. It is one of several exercises that 
illustrates parallel programming principles using students.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Deb Sweeney's lesson on  developing an algorithm for making a sandwich. 
Students will learn the importance of written communication skills and 
sequential thinking while trying to write a computer program on how to make a 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Daniel Swomley from Hanover School, Colorado Springs, USA has a lesson plan
Computers only do what they are told, an exercise on giving directions 
precisely.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>ideone is an online compiler and debugging tool which allows to compile 
and run code online in more than 40 programming languages. The site gives 
sample code for users to look at and compile or debug. Students can get a feel 
of many languages, their syntax and the concept of debugging.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Sumant Murugesh has some ideas on how to bring across the idea that 
computers only do what they are told.<br>
To demonstrate the need to formalise 
everyday language, do some exercises for everyday tasks as a precursor to 
learning Pseudocode later. These activities would demonstrate that programming 
languages are precise and a wrong instruction can lead to bugs:<br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li>Brainstorm with a group of students the steps they will need to perform 
everyday tasks such as below</li> 
<li>Change a broken light bulb</li> 
<li>Close the largest window in the room that has 3 windows of different sizes
</li> 
<li>Unlock a cupboard using a bunch of keys</li> 
<li>Fetch mail from the letterbox outside the house</li> </ol> 
<p>Now disuss the following:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Steps that were easily overlooked</li> 
<li>Decision statements</li> 
<li>Looping/Repetition for a number of times</li> 
<li>Looping until a rogue value is reached</li> 
<li>Need to formalise the language to have some consistency</li> </ol> 
<p>Now is a good time to emphasize the need for more precision particularly in 
Mathematical tasks. Try these exercises for a start:<br>
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Calculate the area of a rectangle</li> 
<li> Given the gross pay of an employee, calculate the income tax and net pay
</li> </ol> 
<p></p>
<p>Now disuss the following: <br>
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Operators and operands</li> 
<li> 
<p>Syntax for writing these tasks so everyone can follow</p> </li> </ol> 
<p></p></li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Classroom Activities and Games: </strong><strong>Advanced Resources
</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Paul A. G. Sivilotti has a Kinaesthetic Learning Activity (KLA) activity 
developed to introduce CS concepts to high school girls isSoftware Engineering: 
&quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot;. This activity illustrates the fact that a program 
is a series of instructions that tells a computer exactly what to do. So, a 
computer scientist must design the program carefully, to be sure that the 
computer will do the right thing. Please note: The above activity requires the 
use of a Lego Rover robot.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Karel the Robot website with fundamentals and activities is an excellent 
method for introducing students to computer programming is described by Richard 
E. Pattis in his book titledKarel the Robot. By initially limiting the 
student's language repertoire to easily grasped imperative commands whose 
actions are visually displayed, the Karel approach quickly introduces students 
to such concepts as procedures and the major control structures. Although 
originally based on Pascal, the Karel approach has been used successfully with 
several different computer programming languages. These pages describe a 
version of Karel that uses the C / C++ language.</p> </li> 
<li>Hobart and William Smith Colleges has the xComputer Lab which uses the 
xComputer applet, which simulates a simple model computer (which is also called 
xComputer). The xComputer applet that you will use in this lab lets you load 
programs and data into the memory of the simulated xComputer. You can then 
watch while those programs are executed, and you can observe how numbers stored 
in the computer change as a program runs. The applet displays only the 
registers and main memory. You have to take the control circuit, ALU, and clock 
on faith.<br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li>xComputer Lab 1: Introduction to xComputer: Introduces the xComputer, a 
simple model computer, and investigates how it operates in a fetch-and-execute 
cycle to carry out machine language instructions stored in its memory.</li> 
<li>xComputer Lab 2: Assembly Language Programming: Covers assembly language 
programming for the xComputer, including labels and indirect addressing.</li> 
<li>xComputer Lab 3: Subroutines: Introduces the idea of a subroutine and 
shows how subroutines can be implemented &quot;by hand&quot; in the assembly 
language of xComputer, even though that language does not offer direct support 
for subroutines.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Matthew Eastaugh has a great website called Computer Tutorial that 
features aMicroprocessor Tutorial (quite a good resource if you are doing this 
standard alongside hardware ones). Some resources of interest here are:<br>

<li>Eric Poll has a downloadable Windows version of The Little Man Computer. 
Excellent for introducing the fetch/execute cycle as an introduction to 
Assembly Language.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Dr. Stuart Madnick has the Little Man Computer(LMC) that models a simple 
von Neumann architecture computer, so it has all of the basic features of a 
modern computer. The LMC can be programmed in machine or assembly code, and the 
following simulator will allow you to run your programs.<br>

<p><strong>Downloads: Basic Resources<br>
</strong>Here we have provided a 
list of links to beginner programming lanuages with their download locations. 
Even though programming is not required for achieving this standard, the 
following websites will provide explanation on the workings of these languages 
such if they are interpreted, compiled etc.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><strong>BASIC: </strong>A list of free downloadable BASIC compilers and 
interpreters can be found athttp://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/basic.shtml
</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Scratch</strong>: can be downloaded at

</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: can be downloaded at 
http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=downloads/download_alice<br>
Alice does not 
need any installation. As long as you download the program and unzip the 
contents to a folder, you can run the Alice application (Alice.exe). You may 
create a shortcut to the application in your start menu or desktop.</p> </li> 
<li><strong>StarLogo</strong>: StarLogo is a specialized version of the Logo 
programming language. With traditional versions of Logo, you can create 
drawings and animations by giving commands to graphic &quot;turtles&quot; on 
the computer screen. StarLogo extends this idea by allowing you to control 
thousands of graphic turtles in parallel. Download StarLogo at
http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/<br>
<br>
StarLogo TNG is The Next Generation 
ofStarLogo modeling and simulation software. While this version holds true to 
the premise of StarLogo as a tool to create and understand simulations of 
complex systems, it also brings with it several advances. Download StarLogo TNG 
athttp://education.mit.edu/drupal/starlogo-tng</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Greenfoot</strong>: Consider greenfoot as a combination between a 
framework for creating two-dimensional grid assignments in Java and an 
integrated development environment (class browser, editor, compiler, execution, 
etc.) suitable for novice programmers. While greenfoot supports the full Java 
language, it is especially useful for programming exercises that has a visual 
element. In greenfoot object visualisation and object interaction are the key 
elements. Download is athttp://www.greenfoot.org/download/<br>

<p>The Greenroom  is a community site for teachers using the Greenfoot 
software. Its purpose is to share experiences and material, and to offer a 
platform for discussion and support. The goal is to help all of us to find 
inspiration, help each other, find interesting material, and ultimately to 
improve our teaching. If you are a teacher, you can apply easily to join and 
use the resources there.</p> </li> </ul>
