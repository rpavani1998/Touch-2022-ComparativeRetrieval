<h1>Welcome To Army Boot Camp!</h1> 
<p>You might be wondering what army boot camp is all about. Well, in the 
United States, this is commonly called as the recruit training and basic 
training. This serves as an initial indoctrination that is originally being 
given only to military personnel as well as enlisted people and officers. The 
army boot camp training program for officers is usually more detailed if you 
will compare it with the other types of trainings.</p> 
<h2><strong>Army boot camp: Things You Need to Know </strong></h2> 
<p>You might be wondering what <strong>army boot camp</strong> is all about. 
Well, in the United States, this is commonly called as the recruit training and 
basic training. This serves as an initial indoctrination that is originally 
being given only to military personnel as well as enlisted people and officers. 
The<em>army boot camp</em> training program for officers is usually more 
detailed if you will compare it with the other types of trainings.</p> 
<p>In this view, if you are interested to enter an army boot camp, what do you 
think are the things that you need to know? If you will ask me, there are 
several most important things that you must know about this recruit training in 
the military field. These are about its varieties, orientations, as well as 
target personal benefits and, of course, the rules.</p> 
<p>On the on hand, when it comes to the varieties of the <strong>army boot camp
</strong> training, these actually vary across nations. This is because every 
country has their own national requirement that they need to address. For 
example, most countries make this kind of training voluntary for their people. 
If a person really wants to enter this kind of physical training, then he or 
she will just sign a waiver that it is a voluntary decision and he or she was 
not forced by the state. However, it can also be mandatory or conscription in 
several countries. As well all know, conscription means the compulsory 
enlistment of a person obliging him or her to do national service works, which 
is usually inclined to military service. Nevertheless, the later is less 
prevalent in these times already.</p> 
<h3>There are different orientations that the army boot camp can cater</h3> 
<p>On the other hand, there are also different orientations that the army boot 
camp can cater. For instance, if you want to be an army, as a recruit, you will 
be training in several basic marksmanship works. You will also be assigned with 
individual weapons as well as other works and trainings like hand to hand 
combat, first aid, basic survival trainings and even physical fitness. On the 
other side, if you want to become a navy or coast guard, your training will be 
focused more on water survival training, basic seamanship as well as some 
special skills training on shipboard firefighting, engineering and signal. 
Aside from that, the training for air force will be different as well since 
there will be several technical skills that you need to understand about being 
such.</p> 
<p>Thirdly, you also need to know about the benefits of the army boot camp 
training to yourself. According to several veterans who survived this kind of 
training, they became a new and better person after the training. For example, 
you will give utmost importance to the concept of team work after the training. 
Aside from being physically fit, the army boot camp will also inculcate to you 
a degree of discipline that you cannot gain through other kinds of trainings 
out there.</p> 
<p>Last, but not the least, you have to know about the rules in the camp while 
you are in the army boot camp training. This is obviously important since you 
will be subject to a program with strict procedures and regulations.</p>
