understand, to express oneself correctly and with good pronunciation. The final 
objective is to raise students' language level to an efficient standard of 
communication. This requires not only a perfect command of the language but 
also a profound understanding of the cultural context. Accord is accredited by 
CSN in northern European countries as well as Bildungsurlaub in several German 
regions, and registered as a Private Institute of High Education, is a member 
of SOUFFLE, Maison de la France, the French Youth Tourism Club, and ELITE.<br>
