<h1>The linguistic genius of adults: Research confirms we&rsquo;re better 
learners than kids!</h1> 
<p> | 95 comments |  Category: learning languages</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I wrote in great detail before about <strong>why adults are much better 
language learners than kids</strong>, but now linguists are starting to chime 
in!</p> 
<p>There is a stupid rumour going around that you can&rsquo;t learn a language 
after a certain age (was it 6, or 12, or 14? I forget where the drunk blind man 
threw the dart that we have been basing this on) and consideringI myself 
started properly at age 21, and how many people have been sharing their own 
success stories with me (if you have one, make sure to share it with all of us 
in the Fi3M forum&rsquo;s success stories section &ndash; the best ones will 
get showcased on the blog!) I hope to have the ammunition to destroy this 
pointless demotivator.</p> 
<h2>The most discouraging TED talk ever</h2> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some frustration with some linguists in the past when they 
make remarks that they can&rsquo;t back up with<strong>relevant </strong>
research, which serve no purpose but to<strong>discourage </strong>learners. 
But when they get taken seriously by the public, then I have to take a stand 
against it.</p> 
<p>Among the worst examples include an otherwise interesting TED talk about 
<em>The Linguistic genius of babies</em> &ndash; in it she shows us a bullshit 
graph about the &ldquo;critical period&rdquo; for learning a language where<em>
all hope is lost</em>from age 17. She drives it home with the comment &ldquo;no 
scientists dispute this curve&rdquo;. Really now?</p> 
<p>She also claims that age <strong>ONE </strong>is where <em></em>we can can 
no longer distinguish foreign sounds any more; &ldquo;You and I can&rsquo;t do 
that&hellip; we can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those 
of foreign languages&rdquo;. This is just ridiculous. After some focused 
training, and sometimes<em>even just a few seconds </em>of paying attention, 
and you&rsquo;ll hear it. In some cases, it&rsquo;s harder and takes a wee bit 
more time, but it&rsquo;s definitely not impossible.</p> 
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t have a clue what she&rsquo;s talking about because she 
actually researches<strong>babies</strong>.</p> 
<p>This stuff really pisses me off as the &ldquo;research&rdquo; tests in a 
context and environment that<strong>children are bound to win on anyway</strong>
 (such as traditional classroom learning) and doesn&rsquo;t test in areas that 
adults would be better at. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned this is totally 
irrelevant research,<strong>as well as being unhelpful</strong>. I can&rsquo;t 
imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read 
some paper where kids came out on top&hellip; in classroom learning, and 
decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the 
kids don&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>Seriously TED, you need to get me to speak up on one of your stages so I 
can undo the damage of this previous talker, as well as destroy people&rsquo;s 
own misconceptions.<strong>Millions </strong>of adults around the world learn 
languages to excellent levels fine all the time. Any sloppy research that comes 
up on this is arguing against an army of people that disprove it.</p> 
<h2>Linguists who are working for the greater good</h2> 
<p>Fortunately this is not the case for all linguists, and now popular 
research is backing up what I&rsquo;ve been saying all along!</p> 
<p>I was just on Google plus, and my friend Joop shared this link with me so I 
thought I had to get it on the blog:</p> 
<p><strong>Age no excuse for failing to learn a new language &ndash; New 
Scientist</strong></p> 
<p>Researchers realised that there are crucial differences in how adults vs 
children learn and tried to demonstrate it in this research. When they did, 
surprise surprise,<strong>adults come out on top</strong>. Once again, for more 
specifics about how I think this works on a broader scale &ndash; read my post 
abouthow you are <strong>not </strong>too old to learn a language.</p>

<p>Hey Benny,<br>
 I found this summary (http://www.zompist.com/whylang.html) 
of why typical kids learn languages easier than typical adults, which 
doesn&rsquo;t get into FMRI research about the brains of kids under 5:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Innate abilities aside, children have a number of powerful<br>
 
advantages:</p> 
<p>1) They can devote almost their full time to it. Adults consider half an 
hour&rsquo;s study<br>
 a day to be onerous.2) Their motivation is intense. 
Adults rarely have to spend much of their time in the<br>
 company of people 
they need to talk to but can&rsquo;t; children can get very little of<br>
 what 
they want without learning language(s).3) Their peers are nastier. 
Embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human<br>
 beings (I owe this 
insight to Marvin Minsky&rsquo;s The Society of Mind, but it was most memorably
<br> expressed by David Berlinski (in Black Mischief, p. 129), who noted that 
of all emotions, from rage to<br>
 depression to first love, only embarrassment 
can recur, decades later, with its full<br>
 original intensity). Dealing with 
a French waiter is nothing compared with the<br>
 vicious reception in store 
for a child who speaks funny.&rdquo;<br>
 So maybe you can use this to turn the 
subject on its head and show adults, who want to learn other languages, why 
they too can learn as easy as kids. Your own adventures are examples of the 
first two points. I realize that you don&rsquo;t like to put yourself in 
situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, I find that even as 
an adult, I get #3 from time to time. Particularly at work. I don&rsquo;t like 
it, but I suppose it is good for me.</p> </li> </ul> &larr; Older Comments <br>
