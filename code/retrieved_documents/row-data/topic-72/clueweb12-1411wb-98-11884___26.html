<h3>CASTLE adds 3 new blog partners!</h3> 
<p>As part of our never-ending quest to tap into the potential of social media 
to enhance the practice of school administrators (and the university 
programs&nbsp;that prepare them), I am pleased to announce thatCASTLE has 
added&nbsp;three new blogs to its portfolio. Two of the three blogs have been 
in existence for a long while; the third is a new blog by a faculty colleague.
</p> 
<p>Are we trying to become the Weblogs, Inc. or Gawker Media (or Education Week
) of the edublogosphere? No, not exactly. But we&nbsp;ARE trying to assemble a 
portfolio of blogs that meet the various technology and/or leadership needs of 
practicing school leaders.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Our blogs</em></strong></p> 
<p>Here are the blogs that we&rsquo;ve initiated to date (and their topical 
focus):</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Dangerously Irrelevant (technology, leadership, and school reform)</li> 
<li>LeaderTalk (school leadership; group blog)</li> 
<li>Edjurist (school law; group blog)</li> 
<li>1to1 Schools (1:1 laptop programs; group blog)</li> </ol> 
<p>To this mix, we&rsquo;ve now added the following (which fill in a few 
significant topical areas in which we were lacking)&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Virtual High School Meanderings
</strong></em>&nbsp;(online schooling)</p> 
<p>Dr. Michael Barbour, an Assistant Professor&nbsp;at Wayne State University, 
has been blogging about online schooling&nbsp;for years. As you&rsquo;ll see if 
you read it for a while, if it has to do with online schooling, you&rsquo;ll 
likely find it at Michael&rsquo;s blog. Michael posts&nbsp;A LOT;&nbsp;the 
comprehensiveness of information he provides is astounding. Michael also 
maintains avirtual schooling wiki&nbsp;or you can follow him on Twitter. 
Michael&rsquo;s blog soon will be renamed<em>Virtual School Meanderings</em> to 
reflect the growth of online schooling in earlier grades.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here are some representative posts to get you started:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Idaho needs our attention</li> 
<li>Documenting Clovis - End of semester edition</li> 
<li>The impact of opencourseware on paid enrollment in distance learning 
courses</li> 
<li>Virtual schooling in the news</li> 
<li>Virtual schooling presentations at SITE</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>6. </strong><em><strong>Educational Games Research</strong></em>
&nbsp;(educational gaming)</p> 
<p>John Rice is an educator, author, and speaker, as well&nbsp;as a doctoral 
student at the University of North Texas, who has been blogging about 
educational gaming since February 2007. I am a learner in the area of 
educational gaming so I always gain a&nbsp;lot from John&rsquo;s posts. John 
does a nice job of looking at K-12 and&nbsp;higher education and also includes 
a post now and then on corporate simulations, serious gaming, and the like.</p> 
<p>Here are some representative posts to get you started:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Learning STEMs from McLarin&rsquo;s Adventures in Oklahoma</li> 
<li>Animating the news: How videogame technologies can alter our perceptions 
of real live events</li> 
<li>How to design an educational video game: Three important considerations
</li> 
<li>Study: Reaction times lowered via video games</li> 
<li>Toy spy robots: A practical way to teach programming</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>7. </strong><strong><em>School Finance 101</em></strong>
&nbsp;(school finance / policy)</p> 
<p>I have known Dr. Bruce Baker, school finance professor extraordinaire, for 
many years. Bruce is a fantastic scholar. His interests extend far beyond 
school finance to include a variety of policy and leadership issues. Those of 
us in educational leadership academic circles know that Bruce is not afraid to 
take on the establishment and confront uncomfortable political and educational 
truths. I was delighted to see that Bruce started blogging more extensively 
last fall and was even more pleased when he agreed to join us. Bruce writes 
about deep, significant school funding and/or policy issues, but does so in a 
way that&rsquo;s accessible to those of us who aren&rsquo;t experts in this 
area. You also canfind Bruce on Twitter.</p> 
<p>Here are some representative posts to get you started:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Racial achievement gaps and within-district funding inequity</li> 
<li>Why do states with the &ldquo;best&rdquo; data systems have the worst 
schools?</li> 
<li>Pondering the usefulness of value-added assessment of teachers</li> 
<li>NCTQ teacher quality ratings: Where&rsquo;s the &ldquo;quality?&rdquo;</li>
<li>New Jersey teacher salaries: Spiraling out of control?</li> </ul> 
<p>I encourage you to subscribe to all three of these blogs for a while. There 
is&nbsp;some really important&nbsp;information and thinking coming out of all 
three of these channels. I can guarantee that you&rsquo;ll learn a lot and gain 
some valuable resources for your own work.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Next steps</em></strong></p> 
<p>What lies ahead for the CASTLE blogs? Well, we will&nbsp;be shifting a 
couple of our existing blogs over to WordPress, so you&rsquo;ll see some visual 
changes and added functionality in the next few months. We&rsquo;re going to 
add some new authors to our group blogs, particularly<em>LeaderTalk</em> and 
<em>1to1 Schools</em>. And we&rsquo;re in conversations with our sponsor, the 
University Council for Educational Administration, about initiating a blog that 
deals with<em>school leadership for social justice</em>. If you&rsquo;ve got 
some other suggestions for us, or know of a blog that might be a good addition 
to our portfolio, let&nbsp;me know!</p> 
<p>Happy reading!</p> <br>

<h3>Video - Online learning</h3> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a 10-minute video I helped make that advocates for P-12 online 
learning. Created byIntermediate District 287 in Minnesota, which heads up the 
Northern Star Online collaborative, the video features Mike Smart, 2007 
Minnesota Teacher of the Year, and a number of other Minnesota educators and 
students. The video will be used for educational and policy advocacy purposes 
with community members, parents, administrators, and legislators.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s my favorite statement I made in the video (at 7:20):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>One of the things I think we have to ask ourselves as school leaders 
is&nbsp;&lsquo;<em>What&rsquo;s our moral imperative to prepare kids for a 
digital, global age?</em>&rsquo; Right now we&rsquo;re sort of ignoring that 
requirement. . . . I think you would take a look at much of what we do in our 
current schooling system and just toss it and essentially start over. So the 
question for school leaders and for policymakers is &lsquo;<em>How brave are 
you and how visionary are you going to be?</em>&rsquo; And you don&rsquo;t even 
have to be that visionary. Just look around right now and see the trends that 
already are happening and just project those out and see that it&rsquo;s going 
to be a very different world.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Happy viewing!</p> <br>

<h3>A day with Will Richardson, Part 3</h3> 
<p>Here is Part&nbsp;3 of my notes from our day with Will Richardson. You also 
cansee the live chat and/or follow the Twitter conversation and/or participate 
in EtherPad.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> We started with a visioning exercise (and accompanying discussion) </li> 
<li>Are we suffering from information overload or information overchoice?</li> 
<li>The nichification / ghettoization / balkanization of society</li> 
<li>Communities of interest don't look like communities of geography</li> 
<li>The #1 characteristic of a healthy network is diversity of ideas. (Stephen 
Downes)</li> 
<li>Adolescents are growing up in a much more transparent environment than 
previous generations; whatever they do is likely going to be public (whether 
they like it or not)</li> 
<li>We are spending a lot more time interfacing through screens</li> 
<li>We are failing to teach adolescents how to use these technological 
affordances in socially responsible and productive ways</li> 
<ul> 
<li>This is because the vast majority of educators aren't information literate 
themselves</li> </ul> 
<li>If you can't figure out who's behind http://www.martinlutherking.org/, 
you're illiterate these days</li> 
<li>It's not hard to make the case that the world is now 24/7/365 anyone 
anytime anywhere. But we need access to it.</li> 
<li>Turning to the National Educational Technology Standards for 
Administrators (NETS-A). We used this document as a self-rubric.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>1a: share the story of what it could look like for kids, lots of meetings 
with stakeholders, showed videos/inspiring tool usage by educators, visited 
other places, created cognitive disconnects, built partnerships with 
business/industry</li> 
<li>1b: has to be an ongoing process/conversation</li> 
<li>2b: making videocasts, using iPod touches for teacher 
observation/evaluation, moved to Google Docs, using digital discussion forums, 
using blogs/wikis/EtherPad, school board is now paperless</li> 
<li>2e: working with SETDA or iNACOL, being active in the blogosphere / 
Twittersphere</li> 
<li>3c: are you creating opportunities for staff to do this?</li> 
<li>5c: give credit when you use photos (modeling attribution), </li> </ul> 
<li>We've got to share more with each other and with others (can CASTLE 
collect some of these stories?)</li> 
<ul> 
<li>For example, Todd Abrahamson (Sigourney) is doing podcasts</li> 
<li>Could we fill in the rubric examples as a group and then share with others?
</li> </ul> 
<li>Networks are about people who are cooperating and sharing; communities are 
groups of people who know each other, roll up their sleeves, and collaborate 
(go even further than networks)</li> 
<li>We now live in an era of perpetual professional development</li> 
<li>Check out the Electronic Crime Institute (John Carver)</li> 
<li>Digital literacy/safety/security issues need to infuse everything; it's 
not a stand-alone unit</li> 
<li>Are our safety/security efforts both everywhere and nowhere?</li> 
<li>I want my kid to fail safely in the vicinity of some responsible adult 
that can help her recognize the ramifications of the mistakes that she is making
</li> 
<li>It can't all happen at school (Dave Keane). Where else is it going to 
occur? (Will Richardson)</li> 
<li>Modeling by adults implies intentional, visible behavior</li> 
<li>Models that Will has seen</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Science Leadership Academy (Philadelphia, PA) - inquiry-based laptop 
magnet school, students are patenting a student-created biodiesel generator, 
SLA is tough to scale, defining questions =<em>how do we learn?</em>, <em>what 
can we create?</em>, and <em>what does it mean to lead?</em>, core values of 
inquiry/research/collaboration/presentation/reflection</li> 
<li>High Tech High (San Diego, CA) - very tech-infused but not getting the 
global/networking piece yet</li> 
<li>Australia is getting every kid a netbook/laptop by 2012</li> </ul> 
<li>Can we do this? Is it possible? What choice do we have?</li> </ul> <br>

<h3>A day with Will Richardson, Part 2</h3> 
<p>Here is Part&nbsp;2 of my notes from our day with Will Richardson. You also 
cansee the live chat and/or follow the Twitter conversation and/or participate 
in EtherPad.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> How are you personally taking advantage of these online / technological 
affordances?</li> 
<ul> 
<li>If you're not, can you participate in the conversation? 'Cause you don't 
have the context.</li> </ul> 
<li>The business sector is behind this; they want specific policy initiatives 
(can ISEA / SAI / Iowa business leaders / etc. all get behind these?)</li> 
<ol> 
<li>Get every kid/home connected (broadband)</li> 
<li>A device for every teacher</li> 
<li>A device for every (secondary?) student</li> 
<li>Do you have a curriculum that supports the things that Will is talking 
about? (does the Iowa Core go far enough?)</li> 
<li>Community forums that educate the average Iowan / statewide visibility 
initiative</li> 
<li>More online coursework options (e.g., statewide virtual high school)</li> 
<li>Education of teachers / community members about workforce / 21st century 
skills / globallization needs/issues</li> 
<li>Greater flexibility for schools to use existing funding streams</li> 
<li>Repeal / revise Dillon's Rule?</li> 
<li>Different / better assessments</li> 
<li>Allow schools to use/create free textbooks and use textbook money for 
student computers</li> </ol> 
<li>We are the last generation that had a choice about technology (Sheryl 
Nussbaum-Beach)</li> 
<li>I am amazed that schools are investing in all of these technology tools
</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Schools should be in the curriculum business, not the hardware business or 
connectivity business</li> </ul> 
<li>We need learners, not teachers, in the front of our classes</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Teachers are no longer the smartest people in the room; the smartest 
people in the room are the ones you invite in from outside</li> 
<li>Teachers come in all shapes and sizes from all parts of the world</li> 
<li>We need to create learning communities, not teaching communities</li> </ul>
<li>I don't know any kids or teachers that have SmartBoards in their bedroom; 
why aren't we focusing on the technologies that our kids have in hand?</li> 
<li>We need a new graduation requirement: <em>Students will be able to create, 
navigate, and grow their own personal learning networks in safe, effective, and 
ethical ways</em></li> 
<li>In Iowa, we need a movement!</li> 
<li>If folks aren't at the table, get them there!</li> 
<li>The world is about networks right now (how can I get the answer I need 
when I need it?), it's not about textbooks and memorization</li> 
<li>Check out fanfiction.net to get a sense of user-generated communities</li> 
<li>We're preparing kids for a world in which they're going to be Googled over 
and over again in their lives</li> 
<li>If you don't share, you don't get hits / visits; you're not visible</li> 
<ul> 
<li>If you can't be found, you're irrelevant (Scott McLeod)</li> 
<li>You have to put yourself out there in ways that people can find you</li> 
<li>Kids are doing this every day without us</li> </ul> 
<li>Kids don't care about much of what we have them do in school - it's 
inauthentic, it lacks meaningful and relevant purpose, it's disconnected and 
decontextualized</li> 
<li>MIT is offering all of its courses online</li> 
<li>Tough questions from Will</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Can you please teach my child to read and write in the context of 
&lt;insert student's interest here&gt;?</li> 
<li>How many of your schools teach Wikipedia (how it works / how to contribute 
/ etc.)?</li> 
<li>How many of your schools teach kids how to read/write in hyperlinked 
environments?</li> 
<li>How many of your schools teach kids how to be Google-able?</li> </ul> 
<li>It's just not us edublogger blowhards; see, e.g., the NCTE Framework for 
21st Century Curriculum and Assessment</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Gut check: How many of these bullet points can you do? Are you literate 
according to NCTE? And if you're not, how are you going to teach our kids?</li> 
</ul> 
<li>This stuff is here already; this is not future stuff</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Will demonstrates Diigo using this Science Daily web page</li> 
<li>Annotated web pages, for example, are social reading. No one is teaching 
our kids how to be social readers.</li> 
<li>We gotta rethink &quot;Do your own work.&quot; Collaboration is everywhere.
</li> </ul> 
<li>Schools spend money on a lot of things that they don't need to be buying 
except in limited numbers: software licenses, textbooks, etc.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>It's increasingly an open source / Creative Commons world</li> </ul> 
<li>See the Flat Classroom Project 2006, 2007, and beyond</li> 
<li>Will collected all of the work that got sent home in his two kids' Friday 
folders for a year; the stack was 2.5 feet tall</li> 
<ul> 
<li>This didn't include all the work that stayed at school</li> 
<li>His kids never went back and looked at all that paper; they had zero 
investment in it</li> </ul> 
<li>Will showed Radio WillowWeb</li> 
<li>Will showed the 2009 Horizon Report</li> 
<ul> 
<li>&quot;Increasingly, those who use technology in ways that expand their 
global connections are more likely to advance, while those who do not will find 
themselves on the sidelines. With the growing availability of tools to connect 
learners and scholars all over the world &mdash; online collaborative 
workspaces, social networking tools, mobiles, voice-over-IP, and more &mdash; 
teaching and scholarship are transcending traditional borders more and more all 
the time.&quot;</li> 
<li>Is your own personal learning practice transcendent? Are you learning / 
interacting differently? And if not, why not?</li> </ul> 
<li>Will quoted Howard Gardner: &quot;[A]fter millennia of considering 
education (learning and teaching) chiefly in one way, we may well have reached 
a set of tipping points: Going forward, learning may be far more 
individualized, far more in the hands (and the minds) of the learner, and far 
more interactive than ever before. This constitutes a paradox: As the digital 
era progresses, learning may be at once more individual (contoured to a 
person&rsquo;s own style, proclivities, and interests) yet more social 
(involving networking, group work, the wisdom of crowds, etc.). How these 
seemingly contradictory directions are addressed impacts the future complexion 
of learning.&quot;</li> 
<li>The reality is that the way we've done professional development for the 
last 30 years doesn't work.</li> 
<li>You have to create a culture in your teaching staff where, if they need to 
know how to blog, they can go online and learn themselves (in communities)</li> 
<ul> 
<li>We've made teachers as passive about learning as kids - kids wait for 
teachers to tell them how/what to learn; teachers wait for us to tell them 
how/what to learn</li> 
<li>NSDC agrees: it should be long-term, job-embedded professional development 
that really shifts practice</li> </ul> 
<li>There aren't enough educators / policymakers that are looking at the

<h3>The end of teacher sameness and solidarity</h3> 
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>[I]n American education, policy making is not guided by what is best for 
children or the larger public. It is a political process driven by power. And 
the most powerful groups in that process are special interests, led by the 
teachers unions, with a stake in keeping the system as it is. . . . Reforms of 
real consequence are vigorously resisted and watered down. (p. 149)</p> 
<p>Traditionally, teachers have taught students face-to-face in classrooms. 
This is the standard role, common across virtually all teachers, and has 
allowed for a pervasive sense of occupational sameness that has long been a 
very good thing for the unions. It encourages teachers to see themselves as 
having a common set of work interests, as being equally deserving, and as 
sinking or swimming together. And all of this promotes solidarity, which is 
critical to the unions&rsquo; ability to attract members, gain their financial 
and emotional support, and mobilize them for economic and political ends. (p. 
158)</p> 
<p>[T]eachers unions are steadfast in demanding sameness . . . [t]he idea is 
to minimize all sources of differentiation, because they undermine the common 
interests and solidarity that so contribute to union success. . . . [H]owever, 
technology gives rise to a differentiation of roles among teachers. Some may 
still work face-to-face with students in classroom settings. . . . Some may 
work with students in computer labs, handling much larger classes than 
today&rsquo;s teachers do (because the computers are taking over much of the 
actual teaching). Some may work with students online but still do it in real 
time. Some may engage in distance learning but do it asynchronously . . . Some 
may work mainly with parents, monitoring student progress and assuring proper 
student oversight. Some may oversee or serve as mentors to the front-line 
teachers themselves. And more. These and other jobs . . . require different 
skills and backgrounds, may call for varying levels of pay, . . . offer 
teachers a vast array of occupational opportunities they didn&rsquo;t have 
before, encourage a level of entrepeneurialism and individualism among them . . 
. The profession of the future will be a much more differentiated and 
entrepeneurial one, and such a profession spells trouble for the unions . . . 
it is destined to be a profession that will no longer concentrate teachers in 
common geographic locations and monopoly employers &ndash; and the resulting 
dispersion of teachers to new locations, combined with the diversity of 
employers that goes along with it, cannot help but create additional layers of 
differentiation that affect how teachers see their own interests.&nbsp;(p. 
159&ndash;160)</p> 
<p>[T]he pervasive sameness that the unions have always counted on will slowly 
fall apart. As the years go by, they will have a harder time generating the 
solidarity they need to motivate teachers to join, to keep them as members, to 
mobilize supportive action&nbsp;- and to do the things successful unions need 
to do if they are to wield power in politics. As sameness and solidarity 
decline, so too will their political power. (p. 160)</p> </blockquote>

<h3>Greater use of technology allows for decreased numbers, but improved 
quality, of teachers?</h3> 
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There is every reason to believe that technology will only become more 
effective with time. The same cannot be said of the traditional 
&ldquo;technology&rdquo; of education - teachers and classrooms&nbsp;- unless 
that world changes fundamentally. (p. 77)</p> 
<p>Scores of technology-based instructional programs are being used in schools 
throughout America. . . . A recent survey indicated that the two main issues 
holding back technology use are &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t fit in the 
schedule,&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is not sufficient time to train 
teachers.&rdquo; Nowhere does it say that the software is inadequate or that 
technology has dubious instructional value. (p. 77)</p> 
<p>If elementary students spend but one hour a day learning electronically, 
certified staff could be reduced by a sixth. At the&nbsp;middle school level, 
two hours a day with computers would reduce staff requirements by a third. High 
schools, with three hours of usage, could reduce staff by up to a half. This 
level of computer usage is quite feasible given instructional technology that 
exists today. (p. 80).</p> 
<p>The quality of teachers would benefit from the increased use of technology 
in at least two important ways. Even after investing in hardware and software, 
which are trivial compared to the cost of teachers, schools would have funds 
from staff savings to increase teacher pay and to provide more time for teacher 
training and planning. Added time for professional development, with proper 
supervision and accountability, would improve teacher quality. Added pay would 
help attract and retain better talent. Better talent is the most important 
ingredient of better schools. The [Dayton View Academy and Dayton Academy] 
charter schools . . . are already demonstrating the feasibility of these ideas 
&ndash; in the toughest of circumstances. (p. 80)</p> </blockquote>

<h3>Correlation or causation? Teacher resistance to state technology 
initiatives</h3> 
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>A.</strong> &ldquo;The average technology score [from Education 
Week&rsquo;s<em>Technology Counts 2008</em>] drops as union membership grows. . 
. . technology seems to be advancing more quickly in states where the unions 
are weakest&rdquo; (p. 107). [chart is from p. 108]</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>B.</strong> &ldquo;The percentage of states with state-level 
virtual schools drops steadily as the unionization of teachers grows&rdquo; (p. 
118). [chart is from p. 119]</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>C.</strong> &ldquo;[We] look at the percentage of states . . . that 
have data systems with the capacity to link students and teachers . . . [and 
see] the same basic pattern as for virtual schools &ndash; which is telling, as 
virtual schools and teacher identifiers have little to do with one another 
aside from their impact on union interests&rdquo; (pp. 138&ndash;139). [chart 
is from p. 139]</p>

<h3>Technological change is destined to be resisted by the teachers unions</h3>
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The fact that [technology] offers enormous benefits is not enough to 
guarantee that it will be embraced by the public schools and its potential 
fully realized. Technological change will run into the same political 
roadblocks that all major reforms have run into, and for exactly the same 
reasons. Powerful groups will try to block it. (pp. 29&ndash;30)</p> 
<p>It is a fact that the teachers unions have vested interests in preserving 
the existing educational system, regardless of how poorly it performs. It is a 
fact that they are more powerful &ndash; by far &ndash; than any other groups 
involved in the politics of education. And it is a fact that in a government of 
checks and balances they can use their power to block or weaken most reforms 
they do not like. To recognize as much is not to launch ideological attacks 
against the unions. It is simply to recognize the political world as it is. (p. 
54)</p> 
<p>If anything is stone-cold certain about the current structure of power, it 
is that technological change is destined to be resisted by the teachers unions 
and their allies. This is &ldquo;their&rdquo; system, and they are compelled by 
their own interests to preserve and protect it. They will go to the ramparts to 
see that technology does<em>not</em> have real transformative effects. (p. 55)

<h3>Technology will free learning from the dead hand of the past</h3> 
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The American education system faces much more than a performance problem. 
It also faces a<em>political</em> problem that, in the grander scheme of 
things, is more fundamental than the performance problem itself - because it 
prevents the performance problem from being seriously addressed and resolved. . 
. .</p> 
<p>What sets technology apart from other sources of reform is that . . . it 
also has a far-reaching capacity to<em>change politics</em> - and to eat away, 
relentlessly and effectively, at the political barriers that have long 
prevented reform. Technology, then, is a double-barreled agent of change. It 
generates the innovations that make change attractive, and at the same time it 
undermines the political resistance that would normally prevent change from 
happening. . . .</p> 
<p>This will mean real improvement, and real benefits for the nation and its 
children. It will also mean something still more profound: the dawning of a new 
era in which politics is more open, productive ideas are more likely to 
flourish &ndash; and learning is liberated from the dead hand of the past. [<em>
Liberating Learning: Technology, Politics, and the Future of American Education

<h3>It would be impossible for the information revolution to unfold and NOT 
have transformative implications for how children can be educated</h3> 
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Even today, with educational technology in its earliest stages:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Curricula can be customized to meet the learning styles and life 
situations of individual students.</li> 
<li>Education can be freed from geographic constraint.</li> 
<li>Students can have more interaction with . . . teachers and students who 
may be thousands of miles away or from different nations or cultures.</li> 
<li>Parents can readily be included in the communications loop.</li> 
<li>Teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed 
in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.</li> 
<li>Sophisticated data systems can put the spotlight on performance [and] make 
progress (or the lack of it) transparent.</li> 
<li>Schools can be operated at lower cost, relying more on technology (which 
is relatively cheap) and less on labor (which is relatively expensive). . . .
</li> </ul> 
<p>Information and knowledge are absolutely fundamental to what education is 
all about . . . and it would be impossible for the information revolution to 
unfold and<em>not</em> have transformative implications for how children can be 
educated and how schools and teachers can more productively do their jobs. . . .
</p> 
<p>Precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of 
schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of 
the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system. [<em>Liberating 
Learning: Technology, Politics, and the Future of American Education</em>, pp. 
7&ndash;9]</p> </blockquote> <br>

<h3>Education's resistance to technology will be overcome</h3> 
<p>Terry Moe and John Chubb say&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The revolution in information technology is historic in its force and 
scope: reshaping the fundamentals of how human beings from every corner of the 
globe communicate, interact, conduct their business, and simply live their 
lives from day to day. Education has so far resisted this revolution, as we 
could have predicted. But&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;we believe the resistance will be 
overcome &ndash; not simply because technology generates innovations of great 
value for student learning (which it does), but&nbsp;. . . because it is 
destined to have surprising and far-reaching effects on politics and power . . 
. . Technology will triumph. But the story of its triumph is a political story.

Education</em>, pp. xi-xii]</p> </blockquote> <br>

<h3>NECC - My adventures with Horse &amp; Hound magazine: Florida Virtual 
School, Achieve3000</h3> 
<p>A few days before NECC I was invited by a publicist to interview Julie 
Young, the Executive Director of theFlorida Virtual School&nbsp;(FLVS), and 
also speak with the folks fromAchieve3000. I accepted because I&rsquo;ve always 
wanted the chance to talk with Julie. I had no idea in advance that I would end 
up having a&nbsp;<em>Notting Hill</em> <em>Horse &amp; Hound</em> magazine-type 
experience&nbsp;(and, yes, I was Hugh Grant).</p> 
<p><strong><em>Florida Virtual School</em></strong></p> 
<p>I knock on a door and am quickly ushered into a hotel suite. I meet and 
shake hands with Ben Noel, CEO of360Ed, as he walks out the door. Then I 
am&nbsp;offered a beverage, plunked onto a couch, handed a packet of publicity 
materials, and given 30 minutes to talk with Julie and Andy Ross, VP of Global 
Services for FLVS. The topic: FLVS&rsquo; new online video game / American 
History course,<em>Conspiracy Code</em>. I&rsquo;m a little bit disoriented but 
gamely dive in&hellip;</p> 
<p><em>Conspiracy Code</em>&nbsp;runs on a custom gaming engine designed 
specifically for FLVS by 360Ed. It cost $1.5 million to develop; costs were 
shared equally by FLVS and 360Ed and spread over three years ($250K per partner 
per year). Two hundred FLVS students are in the game now. Several other 
districts are piloting it.<em>Conspiracy Code</em> is designed to be 
an&nbsp;integrated,&nbsp;full-year course / gaming experience. Students take 
about 90 to 100 hours to complete the game. They dip in and out of the gaming 
engine throughout the year, assembling clues and completing missions. The game 
includes 51 assessments (both oral and written), 270 mini-games, numerous 
interrogations, 30 &lsquo;agent eliminations,&rsquo; and 371 clues. Teachers 
monitor student progress;&nbsp;each of the 10 missions takes 2 to 3 weeks. Most 
students spend about an hour a day working for the class, some of which is in 
the game environment. Historical facts are interwoven throughout the gaming 
experience and student-teacher discussion. Sometimes the game requires students 
to do outside research to complete assignments and proceed forward.</p>

<li><em>Conspiracy Code</em> Product Overview</li> 
<li><em>Conspiracy Code</em> Press Release</li> 
<li>FLVS <em>Consipiracy Code</em> web site</li> 
<li>FLVS Presskit</li> 
<li><em>Education Next</em> article about FLVS</li> </ul>  The first 
evaluation report on the<em>Conspiracy Code</em>&nbsp;is due in a couple of 
weeks but anecdotal evidence looks extremely&nbsp;promising. The students who 
seem to like the game the most are the ones who &lsquo;hate history.&rsquo; The 
game requires students to write, create data maps, make timelines, ask 
questions, make associations, solve problems, etc. Students must apply their 
knowledge and facts in a number of different ways to be successful. Some 
&lsquo;barriers&rsquo; were put in place to ensure that students didn&rsquo;t 
play more than work (e.g., students can&rsquo;t move forward until they work on 
their data&nbsp;map, write in their journal, get feedback from their teacher, 
etc.).  &nbsp;  The first two teachers were &lsquo;gaming people.&rsquo; It 
still took them 2 to 3 months to get comfortable with teaching this way. All 
FLVS teachers receive extensive professional development before they&rsquo;re 
allowed to teach. The first few teachers will train those that follow. There is 
a &lsquo;Teaching Online 101&rsquo; course plus a separate gaming module for<em>
Conspiracy Code</em>.  &nbsp;  Now that the gaming engine has been built, FLVS 
will use it for other games/courses; I also suggested that FLVS release it to 
students to design their own games. The next<em>Conspiracy Code</em> game will 
target reading and comes out in August. All in all, it appears to be a solid 
attempt at integrating gaming into the education experience. It will be 
interesting to see the evaluation results when they come out. FLVS is a 
data-driven organization and is committed to reworking the game/course as need 
be to ensure students are both engaged AND learning whatever facts they need 
for success in&nbsp;the standardized-testing era. 
<p><strong><em>Achieve3000</em></strong></p> 
<p>Throughout our conversation, people are coming in and out of a door to 
another room in the suite (reporters? other bloggers?). When my 30 minutes with 
Julie and Andy are up, I&rsquo;m swooped into that room, replaced by someone 
else who gets my spot on the FLVS couch. I&rsquo;m&nbsp;handed another 
publicity packet, do the quick meet-and-greet, and away we go&hellip;</p> 
<p>Achieve3000 is a &lsquo;differentiated instruction solution.&rsquo; In 
essence, students are given an article to read on the computer that&rsquo;s 
aligned with their reading level. The company recommends a minimum of 1 or 2 
articles a week but there are articles available every day if desired. Great 
care has been taken to avoid stigmatization of low-level readers. For 
example,&nbsp;even though the article text and corresponding assignments are 
geared to students&rsquo; individual reading level, the overall layout of the 
article, font size, graphics, etc. all are extremely similar to what other 
higher-level readers in the class are experiencing. There is little to no 
difference in reading experience; it&rsquo;s actually fairly difficult to tell 
at a glance at what level another student is working. The student reading at 
first-grade level also is reading the same content as her peer at the 
ninth-grade level. This allows low-level readers to still contribute to class 
discussions. All of this is in contrast to schools&rsquo; typical practice of 
having separate books or textbooks &ndash; often on separate topics &ndash; or 
pullout programs for struggling readers.</p> 
<p>Results so far seem to be impressive. Expected student growth in a year is 
46 lexile points. Students who read&nbsp;one article a week average 102 lexile 
point gains; students who read&nbsp;two articles per week average 124. The 
program accommodates Spanish-speaking students&nbsp;(and, soon,&nbsp;those that 
speak Haitian Creole). The New York City and Miami-Dade school districts (as 
well as the State of Hawaii) are using Achieve3000. Average gains in one year 
for ESL/ELL students are 166 lexile points (compared to 27 points expected). 
Good results also are being seen with students with special needs (see, e.g., 
the Arrowhead (WI) Schools).</p> 
<p>Achieve3000 is working with the Associated Press and now has an archive of 
over 16,000 nonfiction articles. Next steps for the company are to 1) create a 
number of specific science units, and 2) identify and/or write articles that 
target specific career clusters and can be aligned with theWorkKeys job skill 
assessment program.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Final impressions</em></strong></p> 
<p>My time is up. I&rsquo;m whisked out of the back room toward the hotel 
suite door. Julie and Andy are talking with someone new on the couch and 
I&rsquo;m soon in the hallway, left at last to collect my thoughts. As I walk 
toward the elevator to return to my own hotel room, I&rsquo;m left with one 
thought:<em>Man, was that strange. Quite informative, but strange nonetheless. 
Who knows what else goes on in the back hallways, hotel suites, and meeting 
rooms of NECC?!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I received no incentives from either 
organization (other than a thumb drive from FLVS that contained the above<em>
Conspiracy Code</em> materials) and was not pressured to cover them in any 
particular way. In short, I believe I was treated much like any media 
representative, despite being &lsquo;just a blogger.&rsquo;</p> <br>

<h3>Online instruction, stubborn resistance, and stupid faculty</h3> 
<p>A two-part tale of higher education and online instruction&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Students demand free beer too&rdquo;</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong> </p> 
<p>A May 29 article in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> reads as 
follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Opponents of online instruction believe that traditional, face-to-face 
teaching is always better. A colleague of mine, wary of caving in to 
students&rsquo; demands for online courses, remarked recently that 
&ldquo;students demand free beer, too; that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should give 
it to them.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>What her academic colleague&nbsp;somehow, incredibly, fails to realize, of 
course, is that<strong><em>students don&rsquo;t have to attend his institution
</em></strong>. Since postsecondary&nbsp;students vote with their feet and 
their pocketbooks, the institution does indeed have to give students online 
courses if that&rsquo;s what they want. Otherwise, the 
university&nbsp;literally won&rsquo;t have any tuition revenue because its 
potential students went elsewhere instead.</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens over the next couple of decades. As 
online courses become even more prevalent than they are now, colleges and 
universities either will have to get in the game or be left behind. There are 
too many options available to students for anything else to occur. Some 
postsecondary institutions are going to realize that they must become more 
responsive to student needs and desires in order to survive; others won&rsquo;t 
realize it until it&rsquo;s too late and will disappear altogether. It should 
make for interesting times.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, all I can say is&hellip; <em><strong>stupid faculty.
</strong></em></p> 
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never do it again&rdquo;</em></strong></p> 
<p>Another article in the same issue of <em>The Chronicle</em> describes one 
faculty member&rsquo;s woeful experience teaching online. The author goes into 
detail regarding all of the problems that she had with the 
course,&nbsp;including (but not limited to):</p> 
<ol> 
<li>there was a &lsquo;lack of immediacy&rsquo; in communication; </li> 
<li>she was &lsquo;only able to introduce students to a limited amount of 
material outside of the textbook readings;&rsquo;</li> 
<li>it is &lsquo;simply impossible to replicate a lecture online;&rsquo; </li> 
<li>there wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;enough time or a proper forum&rsquo; to help 
students &lsquo;develop writing and critical thinking skills or to foster 
original ideas;&rsquo;</li> 
<li>online courses are too big; </li> 
<li>she had no time off during the week like she would with a regular 
3&ndash;hour, once-a-week,&nbsp;face-to-face class;</li> 
<li>she got too many e-mail messages from students; and</li> 
<li>she suspected her students didn&rsquo;t like her very much.</li> </ol> 
<p>This faculty member obviously has no idea that 1, 3, and 5 are dependent on 
how the course and the technology were structured. Setting up the course in a 
different way might have alleviated many of her concerns.&nbsp;Issues 2 and 6 
seem to be the result of her own decision-making, not any inherent flaw in 
online instruction. Issue 4 doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me; didn&rsquo;t 
she have the same number of weeks as for her other courses? It&rsquo;s hard for 
me to be sympathetic regarding Issue 7:<em>My students contacted me too much 
and asked me too many questions! Waaahh!</em> I guess she prefers it when her 
students stay out of touch and don&rsquo;t try to get their questions answered. 
Finally, can she really blame Issue 8 on the fact that the instruction was 
&lsquo;online?&rsquo; There sure are a lot of faculty who teach online and also 
have students who like them.</p> 
<p>Again, my main thought on this is&hellip; <strong><em>stupid faculty.</em>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Wrap-up</em></strong></p> 
<p>Whether we want it to or not, the paradigm shift is occurring around us 
every day. As postsecondary faculty members, it behooves us to learn about it 
and adjust rather than dismissively rejecting the new learning landscape and 
stubbornly trying to stick to the status quo.</p> 
<p>[Okay, calling these faculty members stupid probably is a little harsh. But 
I think<strong><em>clueless</em></strong> fits quite nicely&hellip;]</p> <br>

<h3>Iowa - A robust system of online learning</h3> 
<p>[This is Post 2 for my guest blogging stint at The Des Moines Register.]</p>
<p>Archimedes said &ldquo;Give me a lever long enough and I can move the 
world.&rdquo; This week I am blogging about 5 key levers that I think are 
necessary to move Iowa schools forward and help our graduates survive and 
thrive in this new digital, global age in which we now live.Yesterday I 
discussed<em>21st century curricula</em>. Today&rsquo;s post concerns <strong>
online learning opportunities for students</strong>.</p> 
<p>When most people think about online learning, they think about adults 
taking online university classes. Or they might think about the online training 
that occurs in many workplaces. But online learning opportunities occur in the 
K-12 sector as well and are increasingly popular with students and their 
families.</p> 
<p>The Sloan Consortium estimates that at least 1 million K-12 public school 
students took an online course last year. This represents approximately 2% of 
the national K-12 public school student population and is a 22&ndash;fold 
increase since 2000.About 20 states have statewide virtual high schools that 
deliver online courses to students across the state. Others, like Iowa, have 
state-led programs that help deliver some online courses to students.</p> 
<p>Florida appears to be the model for the rest of the country. The Florida 
Virtual School offers almost 100 online courses and is expected to serve more 
than 80,000 students this year.&nbsp;Its enrolllment is growing at a pace of 
50% per year. North Carolina, Utah, and Alabama also have very robust statewide 
virtual schools.</p> 
<p>In addition to creating statewide virtual&nbsp;schools, states are enacting 
a number of other policies to facilitate online learning. For example, both
Michigan and Alabama now have state laws requiring that students have an online 
learning experience before they graduate.Florida recently passed a law 
requiring every school district to provide online courses (either&nbsp;itself 
or by contracting with others) for its K-8 students.</p> 
<p>The reasons are numerous for the popularity of online courses with schools, 
students, and parents. For many school districts, online courses are the only 
way to provide&nbsp;high-level classes such as Advanced Placement, foreign 
language, advanced science or math,&nbsp;and other courses.&nbsp;Other 
districts are finding that online coursework can be an excellent option for
at-risk students or credit recovery; for homebound, incarcerated, or 
home-schooled students; or for meeting the needs of students who simply may not 
be successful in a more traditional classroom environment.Meta-analyses of 
existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online 
courses is approximately equivalent. Students and parents value the 
flexibility, accessibility, and convenience of online coursework. Many online 
courses also allow students to proceed at their own pace;&nbsp;collaborate with 
students from other schools or countries; and/or incorporate digital 
technologies into their learning.</p> 
<p>Online learning opportunities for K-12 students are exploding across 
America. TheUnited States Department of Education found that four years ago 
over a third of school districts already had students taking online courses. 
Unfortunately,<strong>here in Iowa we are&nbsp;NOT keeping pace</strong>. The 
most recent data from the International Association for K-12 Online Learning 
(iNACOL) show that only a few hundred&nbsp;of the 480,000 K-12 students in Iowa 
are enrolled in&nbsp;online courses. Entities such asIowa Learning Online, the 
Iowa Online AP Academy, and Kirkwood Community College&rsquo;s High School 
Distance Learning Program all are delivering courses to students. The Des 
Moines Public Schools also are exploring some online learning 
options.&nbsp;However, even if online enrollments in Iowa soon will number in 
the low thousands,&nbsp;the overall availability of online learning 
opportunities for Iowa students still is extremely low.</p> 
<p>A&nbsp;robust online learning infrastructure for students makes a lot of 
sense for the state of Iowa (and I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;sa bill in the Iowa 
House to consider it). If we&rsquo;re honest with ourselves, we will recognize 
that most of our school districts will NEVER be able to provide the curricular 
diversity that most of our graduates need to be effective digital, global 
workers and citizens. If we&rsquo;re truly honest, we also will recognize that 
theIowa Communications Network (ICN) is not a viable future option. The ICN is 
a closed,&nbsp;aging&nbsp;network and the course offerings (and monies) there, 
like everything else in the world,&nbsp;must move to the Web. Whether 
it&rsquo;s a statewide virtual school or some other model, we must 
significantly increase the number of online courses available to Iowa students 
if we are to provide them access to the high-quality learning opportunities 
envisioned in theIowa Core Curriculum.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>After class</h3> 
<p>I love winter. But I'll admit it's been a bit nippy here lately. Here was 
the temp when I got out of my class in Mason City Wednesday night:</p> <br>
<br>
 My class is a blended model of instruction: some face-to-face meetings and the 
rest online. In this kind of weather, that meansfewer long drives through 
blowing snow for me and my students and fewer frozen noses. We can cozy up 
inside our warm homes and yet still learn from each other... Awesome!<br>

<h3>SETDA's Class of 2020 Action Plan for Education</h3> 
<p>The State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) has been on 
an unbelievable tear this year. Back in February it released its annualTrends 
Report&nbsp;on NCLB Title II, Part D (Enhancing Education Through Technology, 
or E2T2). Previous national reports are availableat the SETDA web site
.&nbsp;You also can access state-level reportsat the Metiri Group&rsquo;s web 
site.</p> 
<p>Now SETDA&rsquo;s <em>Class of 2020 Action Plan for Education</em> project 
is releasing its reports. The first three already are available:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Powerful broadband access for all: Breaking through the barriers</li> 
<li>STEM education: Achievement and innovation</li> 
<li>Technology-based assessments improve teaching and learning</li> </ul> 
<p>Two more reports are coming out this month and next:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Empowering teachers: A professional and collaborative approach</li> 
<li>Robust, rigorous, and right-on-time learning through online courseware</li>
</ul> 
<p>Be sure to tap into the incredible&nbsp;wealth of good information on the 
Reports, Research &amp; Tools page of&nbsp;the SETDA web site [warning: 
it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in here for hours&hellip;]. There are numerous 
high-quality resources available for K-12 educational technology advocates and 
change agents, including the 2007 report,Maximizing the impact: The pivotal 
role of technology in a 21st century education system.</p> 
<p>Keep up the great work, SETDA!</p> <br>

<h3>DRAFT - Statewide 21st century learning system</h3> 
<p>[cross-posted at the TechLearning blog]</p> 
<p>Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to outline what it 
takes to get your state or province from &lsquo;here&rsquo; to 
&lsquo;there.&rsquo; In other words, what would it take to get from our current 
system of schooling to a robust, province- or statewide system of 21st century 
learning? Here&rsquo;s my first attempt at this task (click on the images for 
larger versions)&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>PART 1</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>What needs to be done</em></strong></p> 
<p>The first step is to figure out what needs to happen&hellip;</p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li><em>Curricula that emphasize 21st century skills.</em> Instead of simply 
adding on 21st century skills to our existing content-based standards, put them 
at the core of new, more focused curricula.</li> 
<li><em>Preservice and inservice training for teachers and administrators.</em>
 Training in colleges and universities. Training on the job. Regular, frequent, 
strategic, and ongoing.</li> 
<li><em>Robust statewide online learning infrastructure for students and 
teachers.</em> Because of resources or geography, high-level and credit 
recovery courses aren&rsquo;t available to many students. Training 
opportunities aren&rsquo;t available to educators. A vibrant system of online 
courses can help.</li> 
<li><em>Computing device in every student&rsquo;s hands.</em> Laptops. 
Netbooks. Smartphones. Devices that have some power, are mobile, allow students 
to type, and can access the Internet.</li> 
<li><em>Statewide no-cost or low-cost broadband wireless access.</em> 
High-speed wireless in every corner of the state.</li> 
<li><em>P-20 coordination, cooperation, and vertical articulation.</em> 
Curricular, programmatic, workforce development, and other alignment across the 
P-20 spectrum.</li> </ol> 
<p><strong><em>Environmental supports</em></strong></p> 
<p>Some supports need to be in place to facilitate effective 
implementation&hellip;</p> 
<ol> 
<li><em>Federal, state, and local laws, policies, and funding support.</em> A 
thoughtful, helpful array of legal, policy, and funding supports for what needs 
to be done.</li> 
<li><em>Monitoring, assessment, and evaluation.</em> Regular, frequent, 
ongoing. To inform practice, not just for accountability.</li> 
<li><em>Mindset shift. </em>The digital, global age is here. It&rsquo;s time 
to learn how to survive and thrive in it rather than being afraid of it or 
ignoring it.</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>PART 2</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Marketing</em></strong></p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s also a marketing piece to this. Who needs to be informed 
about what needs to be done in order to facilitate a broad base of support and 
buy-in?</p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Parents and community members</li> 
<li>School board members and P-12 educators</li> 
<li>Postsecondary faculty and officials</li> 
<li>Employers</li> 
<li>Legislators and policymakers</li> 
<li>Media</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>PART 3</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Cost</em></strong></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m working on this part&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>YOUR INPUT IS DESIRED</strong></p> 
<p>I could use some help on this not-so-theoretical assignment. This is a 
draft. I need a final version by November 5.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>What would your system look like? How would you organize things 
differently? What did I leave out?</li> 
<li>How can we calculate some rough, back-of-the-envelope costs of these 
activities (e.g., just how much would it cost to get wireless broadband across 
the state)? I could really use some assistance costing this out.</li>

<h3>Not so irrelevant 013</h3> 
<p>My latest roundup of links and tools&hellip;<br>
</p> 
<p><strong><em>When did the IT staff get promoted above the superintendent?
</em></strong></p> 
<p>Will Richardson notes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>[A] school superintendent I spoke with &hellip; lamented the fact that his 
IT staff wouldn&rsquo;t give him access to YouTube and even Wikipedia.</p> 
</blockquote>

</strong></p> 
<p>Fun with the Pacific Tree Octopus!</p> 
<p><strong><em>Maybe we should do this for teachers and administrators too</em>
</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Seventy-one-year-old Peggy McIntyre needs to learn as much as she can 
about Windows before 8 a.m.Or else.&quot; </p> 
<p><strong><em>Post-Gutenberg economics</em></strong></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s now a publish-then-filter world. Clay Shirky notes that 
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re clocking a singularity a week at this point.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong><em>We need to educate our educators</em></strong></p> 
<p>Seth Godin says:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be against something you&rsquo;re afraid of. And 
it&rsquo;s easy to be afraid of something that you don&rsquo;t understand.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><strong><em>Open your brain, open your model of education</em></strong></p> 
<p>The Education Innovation blog has an interesting post on closed v. open 
models of education. [Note to self: this might be the world&rsquo;s longest URL]
</p> 
<p><strong><em>Some good thinking going on here</em></strong></p> 
<p>Thanks to Mike Sansone, I recently discovered the Union Square Ventures blog
. InPower to the People, they state:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>[W]e believe that we are only at the beginning of the web&rsquo;s impact on 
the fundamental structure of education. We expect much of that change to be 
away from the existing educational institutions and towards empowering 
individuals and newly-formed groups.<br>
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In Why the Flow of Innovation Has Reversed, they note:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>[T]he vector of innovation has changed. It used to be that innovation 
started with NASA, flowed to the military, then to the enterprise, and finally 
to the consumer. Today, it is the reverse. All of the most interesting stuff is 
being built first for consumers and is tricking back to the enterprise. . . . 
[O]ne reason this is happening is that the success of a web service is more 
often determined by its social engineering than its electrical engineering.<br>

<p><strong><em>Students aren&rsquo;t the only ones missing the big picture</em>
</strong><br>
</p> 
<p>The Florida Department of Education is concerned that students are missing 
the big picture when it comes to science. A task force stated that 
&ldquo;teachers should provide a broader focus on scientific concepts and 
process in a 'big picture' sense.&rdquo; Hmmm&hellip; I wonder if that means 
the Department is going to narrow down the list of required science standards 
and also pare down the size of approved textbooks. I&rsquo;m guessing not.

<p><em><strong>Disempowered today = disempowered tomorrow</strong></em><br>

</p> 
<p>I left this comment at Jim Gates&rsquo; Tipline blog:<br>

<h3>Great blogs for busy administrators</h3> 
<p>One of the things we do at CASTLE is try and expose administrators to 
modern technology tools with which they may be unfamiliar. For example, if we 
want principals to understand the power of blogging, one good way to do that is 
to show them (and maybe even sign them up for) some blogs that are directly 
relevant and helpful to their daily work.<br>
</p> 
<p>I have updated our list of blogs that we recommend for school leaders:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Great blogs for busy administrators </li> </ul> 
<p>You can subscribe to each blog individually or I also have created a feed 
that will allow you to read and/or subscribe to all of the blogs in one place:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Read posts from the overall feed on a web page </li> 
<li>Subscribe to the overall feed via RSS </li> 
<li>Subscribe to the overall feed via e-mail </li> </ul> 
<p>Here's the code if you want to add the blogs as a clip on your web site or 
a blogroll:</p>

<h3>2007 recipients of the Technology Leadership Research Award</h3> 
<p>It is my great pleasure to announce that Dr. Chris Gareis and Sheryl 
Nussbaum-Beach are the recipients of the 2007 Technology Leadership Research 
Award. Here is the abstract from their co-authored article, <em>Electronically 
Mentoring to Develop Accomplished Professional Teachers</em>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>With nearly half of all new teachers leaving the classroom within five 
years, schools are faced with the challenge of retaining early-career teachers 
while simultaneously providing them with the support they need to develop into 
effective professionals. Mentoring novice teachers by pairing them with 
experienced teachers in schools is a widely adopted practice for addressing 
these needs; however, face-to-face mentoring is subject to challenges. A 
promising complement to face-to-face mentoring may be found in the innovative 
use of computer-mediated communications, such as online forums. In an effort to 
support, develop, and retain novice teachers, The College of William and Mary 
has partnered with the Center for Teacher Quality to create ENDAPT &ndash; 
Electronically Networking to Develop Accomplished Professional Teachers. ENDAPT 
is an asynchronous online forum that brings together novice teachers and 
teacher leaders in a virtual mentoring community. This article provides an 
overview of the program model and presents research findings from a study of 
participants' postings using content analysis methodology to identify and 
describe the nature of professional conversations among mentors and novice 
teachers.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Although we can&rsquo;t share the actual article with you (because 
it&rsquo;s currently under review by a journal), Chris and Sheryl will be 
giving a presentation on their paper at theUCEA conference in November which we 
will try to make available to folks.</p> 
<p>I would like to publicly thank the other practitioners and academics who 
took the time out of their extremely busy schedules to participate in the 
anonymous review process this year:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Kurt Bernardo, Technology Coordinator, Orange City (OH) Schools; 2005 Ohio 
Technology Coordinator of the Year</li> 
<li>Dr. Jim Morrison, Editor-in-Chief, Innovate</li> 
<li>Dr. Chris Sessums, Director of Distance Education, University of Florida 
College of Education; Best Individual Blog, 2006 Edublog Awards</li> 
<li>Dr. Jon Voss, Coordinator, Northern Star Online (MN) Schooling 
Collaborative</li> </ul> 
<p>The Technology Leadership Research Award is jointly sponsored by CASTLE and 
the UCEA School Technology Leadership Special Interest Group.</p> 
<p>Kudos to Chris and Sheryl. I'm looking forward to the submissions for next 
year!</p> <br>

<h3>Social networking in schools</h3> 
<p>I received this question recently:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>What resources (contacts, advisors, print, online, etc.) do you recommend 
to our school leaders - and lawyers - so they can make informed decisions about 
student access to social networking tools?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Anyone have any suggestions? Is there a place for current social networking 
tools in our students' education?</p> <br>

<p>Surprised? Two primarily online universities and one community college 
among the top five. FYI, theUniversity of Phoenix has more than twice the 
number of students (117,309) as any of the next four (which range from 54,169 
to 50,663).</p>

<h3>Communication Workers of America</h3> 
<p>Earlier this month I featured a report from the Communication Workers of 
America (CWA) as my <strong><em>Report of the Week</em></strong>. Although I 
know that each of you usually reads every comment on this blog (hah!), Beth 
Allen of the CWAleft a later comment that I thought was worth bringing to the 
forefront:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>Hello all.</em></p> 
<p><em>I am very interested in the challenge of articulating the vision as 
well. I work with the Communications Workers of America, on the Speed Matters 
project, which Scott kindly highlighted as a Report of the Week.</em></p> 
<p><em>We are in the initial stages of gathering real stories about how 
universal, affordable broadband can make a real difference. Our research shows 
that even people who don't want broadband for themselves have a vague idea that 
it is important for kids and schools and the future of education. We need to 
move from the abstract to the specific.</em></p> 
<p><em>We are interested identifying educators who would be interested in 
talking about their vision of what they could do if every child had home access 
to a computer with a real high speed connection (think FTTH [fiber to the home] 
with speeds of 30 mbps or more).</em></p> 
<p><em>We are also interested in getting kids to imagine the future - what 
would they do or invent if everyone in the United States had a real high speed 
connection. It might be the world's most awesome video game. It might be a 
video phone system so that they could communicate with their grandparents who 
live far away.</em></p> 
<p><em>If any of you are interested in participating in one of these projects, 
drop me a note at</em><em>http://www.speedmatters.org/contact.html</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Anyone willing to talk with Beth? If so, drop her a note! For what 
it&rsquo;s worth, Beth, here is what I&rsquo;d talk about:</p>

<h3>Virtual world tidbits</h3> 
<p>A few choice items related to virtual worlds...</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dr. Judith Donath hypothesizes a day when spammers will use avatars to 
scam money from us.</li> 
<li>Dr. Edward Castronova, author of the fabulous book, Synthetic Worlds, is 
finding thatgender bias may also occur in virtual worlds. For example, female 
EverQuest avatars fetch 10 percent less in the market, even when they have the 
same powers and skills as male avatars.Check out some of his other work too.
</li> 
<li>Virtual Congress, anyone? (I wonder if it will include scandals...)</li> 
<li>Finally, check out this funny real-world simulation of Second Life 
(brought to you byBlackboard).</li> </ul> <br>

<h3>Interview with Chris Craft</h3> 
<p>Is it already July 3? Way back on June 20 I had the pleasure of talking with
Chris Craft about online learning for a class he's taking. The focus was mainly 
on higher education but much of our conversation was relevant to the K-12 world 
as well. Chris posted our discussion as a podcast in case you'd like to hear it:

<h3>ROTW: Virtual high schools</h3> 
<p>Okay, it's time to try out a new feature here at Dangerously Irrelevant: the
<em><strong>Report of the Week</strong><strong> (ROTW)</strong></em>. Can I 
find and feature an interesting education-related report each and every week? I 
think I can!</p> 
<p>This week's report is from Education Sector:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em><strong>Laboratories of Reform: Virtual High Schools and Innovation in 
Public Education</strong></em> </li> </ul> 
<p>Here's a quote from the report:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>There has been no shortage of solutions for improving the 
nation&rsquo;s public schools. School leadership, teacher quality, standards, 
testing, funding, and a host of other issues have crowded reform agendas. But 
an important trend in public education has gone largely unnoticed in the 
cacophony of policy proposals: the rise of a completely new class of public 
schools - &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; schools using the Internet to create online 
classrooms - that is bringing about reforms that have long eluded traditional 
public schools.</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>All Reports of the Week will be listed under the Reading category (and, in 
most instances, theResearch and Evaluation category). Happy reading!</p> <br>

<h3>Learning Spanish virtually</h3>  Yesterday I uploaded our third CASTLE 
Conversations podcast. I interviewed Julie Sykes, a doctoral student here at 
the University of Minnesota, about her Spanish Pragmatics Project, which is 
using virtual world software (like Second Life) to help postsecondary Spanish 
students learn how to communicate effectively with native Spanish speakers. 
Screenshots are included with the podcast.
<p>The intent of CASTLE Conversations is to interview folks that have 
expertise and are doing interesting things but may not have much national 
visibility. Keep giving us feedback and let us know what you think. As always, 
we're interested in your nominations for interviewees.If you know someone 
interesting that you think we should interview, get in touch!</p> 
<p>Happy listening!</p> <br>

<h3>Online multimedia textbooks: Follow-up</h3> 
<p>My letter to Secretary Spellings in the previous post about online 
multimedia textbooks is the outcome of a conversation that I had withJim Hirsch
, Associate Superintendent for Technology and Academic Services for thePlano 
(TX) Independent School District, at the TIES conference last December. I'm not 
the only one thinking on this front. For example, Scott McNealy, Chairman of 
the Board for Sun Microsystems, said last June that 'technology trumps the 
textbook.' Similarly, four days ago Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, noted that 
textbooks as we know them will disappear.</p> 
<p>To be honest, the two most visible free online textbook initiatives still 
have a long way to go.WikiBooks, a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, seems 
to be having a hard time getting off the ground; most of its content has yet to 
be created or is in the very earliest stages of development.Curriki, which is 
sponsored by Sun and has gotten a lot of media attention, so far seems to 
consist primarily of disparate resources and activities rather than 
comprehensive, meaningfully-organized textbooks. Both seem to be relying on 
volunteers' efforts for most of the content. While both initiatives have 
potential, so far that potential remains unfulfilled. It's early in the game, 
though. TheNational Repository of Online Courses (NROC) also is doing some 
interesting work but appears to be complementing, rather than replacing, print 
textbooks.</p> 
<p>As my letter indicates, I think we need something more intentional and 
systematic. A strategic investment of monies could go a long way toward 
creating some pedagogically powerful, wonderfully engaging, online multimedia 
textbooks that then could be used by anyone in the country (or world). Can you 
imagine what a rich, interactive, media-saturated textbook a team of expert 
teachers, professors, and computer / Web programmers could create given a 
year's time and $800,000 to play with (above and beyond their sabbatical 
salaries)? Can you imagine how fiscally and educationally empowering it would 
be for schools to have free and open access to 150 to 200 high-quality online 
multimedia textbooks created by the top experts in the country?</p> 
<p>Clearly this an expensive venture from a raw dollar standpoint, at least to 
do it well. That said, the $200 million per year figure that I proposed 
represents less than 4 one-thousandths of the current federal discretionary 
funds allocated for K-12 education. The federal government clearly has the 
money to pull this kind of thing off. So might a consortium of states or maybe 
a large private foundation. As big as the numbers are, the return on this 
strategic investment would be HUGE.</p> 
<p>Textbook publishers probably would oppose this idea. So might others, for a 
variety of political, educational, and sociological reasons. But Public 
Education Network CEO Wendy Puriefoy's February 14 statement that &quot;the new 
federal education budget is full of enthusiasm but lacks powerful ideas and 
transformative levels of funding&quot; strikes home with me. I think this is a 
powerful, transformative idea whose time has come and I hope someone besides me 
will think big and make this happen.</p> <br>

<h3>Online multimedia textbooks: A strategic investment</h3> 
<p>[send this letter to Secretary Spellings, Director Magner, and Congress] 
</p> <br>

<p>The Honorable Margaret Spellings<br>
Secretary<br>
United States Department 
of Education<br>
400 Maryland Avenue SW<br>
Washington, DC 20202-7100</p> 
<p>Dear Secretary Spellings,</p> 
<p>The United States Department of Education currently administers a budget of 
approximately $56 billion per year in discretionary monies. I am sending this 
letter to encourage the Department to make a relatively small, but extremely 
strategic, investment that would pay enormous dividends for our nation&rsquo;s 
elementary and secondary students.</p> 
<p>For $200 million per year, the Department could create phenomenal, 
mind-blowing online multimedia textbooks that could be used by students all 
across the country. Imagine 50 teams, each made up of individuals who took a 
paid sabbatical for one year, working to create rigorous, standards-based, 
online textbooks that included text, graphics, electronic presentations, audio, 
video, simulations, learning games, interactive problem-solving and review 
activities, etc. The teams could be comprised as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>16 expert teachers * $100,000 each = $1,600,000</li> 
<li>4 university professors * $100,000 each = $400,000</li> 
<li>8 computer / Web programmers * $100,000 each = $800,000</li> 
<li>1 assistive technology expert * $100,000 = $100,000</li> 
<li>1 national organization representative * $100,000 = $100,000</li> 
<li>1 project manager * $200,000 = $200,000</li> 
<li>Communication and other software, supplies, travel, etc. = $800,000</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Four teachers plus a professor plus two programmers equals a workgroup; 
four workgroups per team. Each team receives ongoing feedback from a 
representative from an appropriate national organization (e.g., National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics, National Council for Social Studies), has 
an assistive technology expert to ensure content accessibility by students with 
disabilities, and has a project manager to keep the workgroups moving along. 
The workgroups create content; post that content online as they go along for 
review, comment, and input from others; and, over the course of a year, create 
several units each that add up to a complete, amazing, deep, rich online 
multimedia textbook.</p> 
<p>Each year would see the completion of 50 textbooks. Over three or four 
years, these Department-sponsored teams would create 150 to 200 textbooks for 
common, key courses (e.g., Algebra I, Physics I, AP English, United States 
History, 5th grade reading) that are present in nearly every school district 
nationwide. Textbook content would be refreshed every three or four years to 
ensure content relevance and usage of the latest digital technologies. If the 
textbooks were wiki-based, much of the content could be revised and updated 
even before their refresh cycle came due.</p> 
<p>Once created, these textbooks then could be hosted by the Department, state 
departments of education, and other entities or could be downloaded for hosting 
on local school district servers. Federal provision of these textbooks would 
free states and school districts to spend funds on laptops, classroom-level 
high-speed wireless connectivity, and other technologies necessary to ensure 
the global competitiveness of our students in the decades to come. All textbook 
material would be free and openly accessible to our nation&rsquo;s K-12 
students and educators.</p> 
<p>I hope that you can see the instructional power of teachers and students 
tapping into expert-created content delivered via the latest interactive, 
engaging digital technologies. Although a few organizations (e.g., Wikibooks or 
Curriki) are attempting to create free online textbooks or learning materials, 
their reliance on volunteers has resulted in relatively little progress. A 
strategic investment by the Department could make an extremely powerful 
contribution to the K-12 educational landscape and would be a powerful lever 
toward ensuring that all students had access to top-quality, engaging learning 
materials.</p> 
<p>Please consider instituting a national online textbook initiative. I 
believe that this is an idea whose time has come and would welcome the 
opportunity to discuss this further with you.</p>

<h3>What if? - Online courses</h3> 
<p>What if every student, not just those in Michigan, had to take at least one 
high-quality online course before they graduated from high school? What if 
every teacher and administrator also had to participate in at least one 
high-quality online professional development experience every three years or 
so? What would our schools be like? What would our children's lives be like?</p>

<h3>Blended Courses and Online Programs</h3> 
<p>I just finished teaching my Thursday night class &quot;Leading Change&quot; 
and decided to blog about the changing paradigm of offering courses and entire 
programs entirely online or through a blended model using face to face and 
online instruction.&nbsp; Over the last 4-5 years I have taught under a 
web-enhanced model.&nbsp; Classes would still meet weekly but I used the web to 
provide additional opportunities for collaboration, uploading assignments, 
posting readings, etc.&nbsp; This is a model that many professors use and I 
personally believe that it has been very effective.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This past spring I taught my first completely on-line course - 
&quot;Data-Driven Decision Making&quot;.&nbsp; While I am a huge advocate for 
technology, I still believe in the power of personal interaction and the 
synergy that can emerge from a group of people deeply engaged in group 
discussions and activities.&nbsp; I was somewhat trepidatious, wondering how I 
might engage students as meaningfully as I had within a classroom 
setting.&nbsp; However, as the course progressed, I was extremely pleased with 
the level of dialogue and interaction that emerged among the 21 students in the 
class.&nbsp; In a &quot;good&quot; face-to-face class meeting (like the one 
that I led tonight), students may deeply engage in discussions with four or 
five other peers, and may hear other classmates share out briefly in a whole 
group setting.&nbsp; However, the online forums and wikis that I utilized in 
the DDDM class, allowed students to interact with all of their peers, not just 
a small group.&nbsp; Many of my students commented that the depth of 
interaction in this online class was much greater than most of their 
traditional courses.&nbsp; This didn't just happen though. I put in much time 
preparing for the course and establishing expectations and norms to create a 
community of learners.&nbsp; I have seen many of my own colleagues successfully 
transition to on-line learning.&nbsp; I have also seen those who did not put 
the time and energy necessary for their on-line classes to be successful and 
the results were as bad as expected.</p> 
<p>My preferred teaching mode is probably a blended approach.&nbsp; I used 
this model this past summer to teach &quot;Technology Leadership in 
Schools&quot;.&nbsp; We met in a computer lab the first 6 class meetings and 
met face to face about every third scheduled class.&nbsp; The remainder of the 
content was delivered in a similar method as my DDDM class with online 
discussions, wikis and other tech leadership related activities and 
assignments.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I hope to continue teaching courses under these various modalities: online, 
blended,and face to face, because they acknowledge interactions needed for 
effective adult learning while utilizing new technologies to allow some of 
those interactions to occur from a distance.&nbsp; Good night. DMQ</p> <br>

<h3>NACOL California symposium</h3> 
<p>NACOL, UCCP, and Pepperdine University are co-sponsoring a regional online 
learning symposium in Los Angeles, California on October 11, 2006. Theweb site 
for the symposium states that the <em>presentations, workshops, lunch, and 
discussions will explore and inspire strategies about online learning, 
including math and science, credit recovery, meeting the needs of gifted 
students, alternative students, remedial education, and increasing access to 
advanced courses and college prep.</em>I like how they included a panel session 
for symposium participants to hear from virtual high school students.</p> 
<p>Registration is limited to 150 participants. Sign up soon!</p> <br>
