<p> <b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Petit Prince in 30+ Languages</b><br>
<i>Antoine de 
Saint-Exup&eacute;ry</i><br>
<b><i>Note: these books are special orders, so 
they will take longer to ship than other products.</i></b><br>
 Equally loved 
by children and adults alike,<i>The Little Prince</i> is one of the most 
translated books on the planet - which is fortunate, as we are able to offer 
here editions in many languages for your (or your child's) enjoyment! With 
wonderful and whimsical illustrations by the author, this delightful tale 
straddles a world between adulthood and childhood, philosophy and fantasy, 
satire and fable, and reminds one not of great children's authors of the past, 
but of more unclassifiable writers like Carroll, Milne, and Tolkien, who seem 
to be writing as much for older as younger readers, and whose writings can be 
enjoyed on many levels. Written in 1943 by Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, who 
disappeared shortly after in WWII during a flying mission for the Allies in 
Northern Africa, it became an instant cult classic and has remained so ever 
since. Enjoy The Little Prince in the language of your choice, and check 
regularly, as we will be adding new versions as they become available.<br>
