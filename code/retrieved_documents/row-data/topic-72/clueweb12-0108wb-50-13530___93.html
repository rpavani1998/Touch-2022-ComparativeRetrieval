Casa 
Craig is an upscale apartment with beautiful views. This apartment is wonderful 
with all amenities to make a family stay very comfortable. The local 
restaurants are great and the little beach just before Onno is a nice place to 
picnic. Kids can swim in the shallow water or fish! The Sporting Club in 
Bellagio offers a swimming pool, sunbeds, tennis, and a restaurant. <br>

The Affinia Chicago is 
a stylish, boutique hotel that is very kid-friendly too. The atmosphere is warm 
and inviting, with large enough rooms for families to be comfortable. Kids have 
access to board games and cards, kid-focused city exploring tips, kids&#146; 
snacks, and free tickets to Navy Pier (even the trolley ride over). 
There&#146;s an onsite restaurant and rooftop lounge, and the location is ideal 
for exploring Chicago, just one block off the Magnificent Mile on Michigan 
Avenue. <br>

<br>I love this property. The location is fabulous behind the Pantheon and you 
can walk everywhere from here. The rooms are well-equipped and the service is

The Allen House has excellent 
serviced apartments for families in a super neighborhood. Our family of 5 was 
extremely comfortable in the 2-bedroom flat we rented in this building. It's a 
secure building, located less than one block from Kensington Street and 1 1/2 
blocks from the Kensington High Street tube station and the super easy double 
decker bus system. There are 2 gourmet grocery stores within walking distance 
and nice neighborhood restaurants. The apartment was very comfortable, clean, 
spacious, and accommodating for our family. <br>

Almyra is an upscale property yet very accommodating with kids. The restaurant 
went out of their way to offer unique, kid-friendly foods. We had a wonderful 
private dinner on our rooftop terrace one night. The overall service here is 
highly personalized. The Almyra is a fantastic place to truly relax and enjoy a

<br>The apartment was child/baby ready with all amenities - cot, baby bath, 
stair gates, bed guards, highchairs, etc. There is a great play area at the 
apartment which our toddler used during our stay. It had trains, swings, slides 
etc and was close enough to watch from the apartment. The pool was fenced and 
also heated, so our little one felt warm inside it. The apartments are close to 
Perugia, Asissi and Cortona - a great location for exploring and easy access 
with roads. There was also a nearby golf course that we managed to play on and 
there is lots to do for young children with nearby beaches and horse riding. We 
had a fantastic time! <br>

I've never experienced a 
hotel that is so beautiful and stylish, yet child-friendly. The service at this 
hotel is incredible and the staff went out of their way to help us in every 
respect. Rooms are bright, cheerful, and are decorated in a fun and funky style 
that our baby loved - even the cot is bright colored and gorgeous. Room have a 
sink, fridge, and stove that are good for simple meals although the restaurant 
is excellent and flexible about meal times which makes it relaxing for everyone.

This

(holding baby sheep, shearing, learning about farm life, etc.) The area has 
both wonderful, easy hiking appropriate for preschool age children and above as 
well as excellent day hikes available for adults. Connecting rooms and baby 
equipment are readily available, and they accommodate food requests for 
children. Childcare is provided by the farmer's daughter (she is delightful).

This family-focused 
mega-resort has endless onsite activities for kids such as water park, water 
slides, and a dolphin experience. The lagoon is great for families given that 
the beach is on open ocean with wild surf. Multiple aquariums are a constant 
source of entertainment. There is a wide array of pools for all ages. 
Restaurants are good too with a selection of varied options. Guest room options 
for families are extensive. <br>

Badrutt's Palace has a wonderful indoor pool and fantastic 
mountain views. Although this is one of Switzerland's landmark luxury hotels, 
it is very child-friendly. My kids enjoyed the Heidi House - a supervised play 
area with activities and movies. There is special attention paid to families 
with a kid's welcome gift and the staff always seemed to have pockets stocked 
with chocolate. <br>

Run by a young family in southern Ireland, the 6-room 
Ballyvolane House offers the comforts of home (plus a good bit of grandeur), 
live-in playmates, and a chance to experience a culture from the inside out. 
With a tree house to play in, woods to explore, animals to feed and fishing on 
premise, you can truly relax here and forget about the winding Irish roads for 
a few days. The hosts are very accommodating to families and go out of their 
way to make stays enjoyable. Since they have 3 kids, they have almost anything 
you forget to bring from toys to raincoats. You also have full run of the 
grounds, from the gardens (basically unchanged since the 18th century) to the 
lakes, where fly-fishing lessons are offered for grown-ups and kids. If you are 
looking for a true Irish country house experience that embraces your children 
too, this is it. <br>

<br>The location is fantastic, right around the corner from Piazza San Marco. 
There is shopping and tourist attractions all around. We stayed in the 
Penthouse Suite and loved our private rooftop terrace. Our room was spacious 
and beautifully decorated. The church bells were loud at night - but that was 
part of the Venice experience. <br>

Borgo Finocchieto is a magnificently renovated 
800-year-old borgo - a village - located a few minutes from Montalcino in 
Southern Tuscany. This location is one of the most beautiful, idyllic parts of 
the region and the views are outrageous. What distinguishes this property from 
others is the number of onsite amenities for this category of accommodation - 
guests have self-catering units with access to vast grass area plus a lovely 
swimming pool, tennis courts, a bocce court, a basketball court, a spa, and a 
state-of-the-art gym. Moreover, the General Manager, Marco, is very 
well-connected in the area and specializes in creating exclusive itineraries 
and activities for his guests. There is a mix of apartments and larger 
villa-type units here noting that the property is ideally configured for groups 
that can take over the borgo and staff, consequently, there may be many weeks 
during the year when the property is unavailable for individual families. 
Private meals can be arranged in the main house or guest rooms - my son is 
still talking about how much he loved his meal cooked by Luigi, the in-house 
chef. <br>

Simple, comfortable rooms. Breakfast is plentiful and delicious. <br>

Although the 
location is somewhat remote, we loved Castello di Vicarello and found that it 
provided the exact authentic Italian experience we wanted for our trip after a 
very hectic work schedule. For the most part, we stayed put and enjoyed the 
beautiful space and grounds. Aurora, the owner, is great and she really took 
care of us. Everyone onsite went out of their way to offer a personalized 
experience for our son. The food here is fantastic - much of it is grown on the 
property. Our apartment was well-appointed and we loved the 
rustic-yet-luxurious character and charm of the decor. <br>

kids. There is a lovely enclosed garden where families can sit outside and 
relax. The concept of getting away and having meals cooked for you in a private

The setting around 
Chateau Ribagnac is stunning. An old chateau, the hotel is wonderfully 
restored, grand, and gorgeous. The owners have created an atmosphere that is 
warm, comfortable, yet still upscale. Guests have the freedom to do as they 
please. Meanwhile, the experience with children is remarkable. The safe and 
secure environment makes it seem like you&#146;re at home where you can put the 
kids to bed with a monitor and head downstairs to relax. There is no noise or 
light pollution and sleeping is easy for everyone. Meals are spectacular. The 
owners, Collette and Patrick, are fantastic hosts and when you leave Chateau 
Ribagnac, you feel like you&#146;ve made friends for life. This is a magical 
place. <br>

This lovely 500-year-old chateau with just 10 rooms is full of 
character and charm. The experience at Chateau de Saint Paterne is amazingly 
kid-friendly. It's like being in a private home where guests of all ages feel 
comfortable and relaxed. Baby monitors are provided to parents who want them; 
we were able to put our kids to bed and then sit in the lounge downstairs with 
other guests. The expansive grounds are beautiful with a trampoline, ping pong, 
and loads of room for running around. The location of the hotel is very central 
with access to idyllic villages as well as the beach. There is plenty to do in 
this part of Normandy for families. The owners are very friendly and helpful. 
There is an onsite restaurant and the food is superb. <br>

literally walk off the slopes and drop your skis with the valet and that's it! 
They even have boot warmers available&#151;talk about luxury! Our kids loved 
the outdoor heated pool and got a kick out of swimming and jumping in snow at 
the same time. The decor is traditional and comfortable; rooms are spacious 
with full kitchens. If you call ahead, they will even stock the fridge for you.

Club Med Ixtapa is a 
self-contained resort in a beautiful setting. We&#146;ve vacationed here a few 
years in a row and end up never leaving the resort. There is something for 
everyone: parents are able to get a vacation with and without their kids. 
It&#146;s truly the best of both worlds. There is a long list of activities for 
families that want to be busy or you can just chill out. The property feels 
completely safe as it is gated and access is only given to guests and staff. 
Recently renovated, rooms and dining areas are updated. The beach is gorgeous 
with calm, swimmable surf. The food quality is fresh and good with a nice 
selection of kid-friendly foods. The kids club is excellent with great 
counselors. <br>

Colle San Paolo is a fantastic option for families 
visiting Umbria. Recently renovated, well-furnished apartments and a villa are 
spread across a sprawling olive oil estate. The fully equipped kitchens are 
some of the best I&#146;ve seen in this accommodation category. Every room has 
screens and air-conditioning. The owners are enthusiastic about hosting 
families and have put together local itineraries just for kids (from chocolate 
factory visits to guided hiking). The vast space between each apartment complex 
means guests have the best of independent living with a handful of shared 
amenities. Located in Northern Umbria near the border with Tuscany, this is a 
great location for those that want to explore small, less touristy villages and 
outdoor opportunities like hiking and biking are plentiful. <br>

in the villas right on the beach so we are able to enjoy it as much as 
possible. Much of the food served at the restaurant is from the hotel's own 
hydroponic farm and it is amazing and kid-friendly. There are also many 
fabulous restaurants nearby. The kids program is run during the holidays only 
and includes cooking classes and garden tours. Service is top notch and for 
parents that want pampering, the spa is great too. <br>

Cuixmala is the coastal estate of Sir James Goldsmith. Part of a 
25,000-acre nature reserve, this is a wonderful place for a family 
eco-adventure. Surrounded by a jungle and private beaches, you will find 
crocodiles and turtles, and even open land with zebras, gazelles, and antelope. 
Brightly colored guest accommodations featuring Oaxacan fabrics and furniture 
crafted by Mexican artisans include 1-2 bedroom casitas and fully staffed (cook 
and butler) 3-11 bedroom villas. All villa units have private dining terraces 
and spacious outdoor living areas. Although the casita units are inland with a 
jungle view, the setting is stunning. Everyone on property eats from Cuixmala's 
organic farm with locally sourced (and delicious) cheeses, and dairy and meats 
from a nearby ranch. The calm, swimmable cove is a magical place to relax, plus 
there are plenty of activity options for those that want to explore the 
estate&#146;s natural wonders on land (hiking, biking, horseback riding) or sea 
(sailing, kayaking, snorkeling). <br>

This upscale &quot;camping&quot; resort is great for families who want 
to experience the natural beauty of the California coast without the effort of 
really roughing it. El Capitan has something for everyone -- easy or 
challenging hikes into the foothills, a walk to one of the most striking 
beaches in California, a pool and playground, llamas, horses, bike riding -- it 
really can't be beat. You can stay in a safari tent equipped with comfortable 
beds with luxurious bed linens, down comforters, and daily maid service. Or, 
you can opt for a cabin with small kitchen and plenty of sleeping options. We 
loved the fact that resort staff will drop off firewood and fire starters to 
make it easy to build a campfire for s'mores. There's also a great snack bar 
and gift shop with delicious breakfasts. We stayed during Thanksgiving when 
they offered to cater our holiday meal and deliver it to our cabin. Not only 
was the food delicious but they included lovely table decorations to make our 
Thanksgiving very elegant in an outdoor setting. El Capitan is a delightful 
family alternative to the fancier resorts of Santa Barbara and a great outdoor 
experience. <br>

The Equinox is lovely! Starwood purchased the property and did a major

delicious at both the steakhouse and the tavern, and we love the gorgeous 
fire-pit and terrace. Despite all the upscale features appreciated by the 
adults (spa, driving school, golf), there are many families that stay here for 
the easy access to year-round outdoors activities including falconry school, 
swimming, hiking, fly fishing, and skiing at nearby Stratton and Bromley. Rooms 
are spacious and decorated very well. <br>

We were actually able to relax on the beach while our son played in the sand - 
much easier at an intimate resort like this! Cottages are well-appointed for

What makes the Evergreen Lodge special is the summer camp-style 
activities. Everything is organized around a central plaza with many 
entertainment options for all ages including horseshoes, ping pong, and an 
outdoor fire pit. It is a safe and fun set-up for families. There is a toddler 
play area and board games available. One particularly nice feature is the 
affordable children&#146;s menu given that the restaurant is the only option 
for meals and you can&#146;t keep food in cabins because of bears. The staff is 
wonderful and offers great local excursion advice and guided activities. 
Recently renovated Family Cabins are comfortable and ideally configured with 
pocket doors you can close for separation and privacy. Just a mile from 
Yosemite National Park, access to park attractions and a wide variety of 
outdoor adventures is easy. <br>

This hotel is known as the 'Castle in the Rockies' and 
it lives up to that title. Nestled in the Canadian Rocky Mountains in Banff 
National Park, it is a very special place to stay. They have one of the best 
year-round outdoor pools with breathtaking views and scenery. There is a great 
little kids pool for babies and toddlers. Our kids also love ice skating by the

We really enjoyed the Fairmont Kea Lani as a family. We stayed in one 
of the condo units which comfortably fit our extended family of nine. Our condo 
had direct access to the big lagoon pool, was a short walk to beach and had a 
plunge pool on the patio. My kids thought that the plunge pool was the 
highlight of the entire trip! The resort has great pools for a variety of ages 
including one for babies and a kid&#146;s pool with slides. There are daily 
onsite children's activities; some are complimentary and some have a small fee. 
Besides the beach, the resort has good open space for toddlers to run around 
and explore. This resort is a great option for a family reunion. <br>

The hotel is 
beautifully situated overlooking the Lower Village and the St. Lawrence River. 
It is in the center of town so everything is close, including the glass 
funicular which the kids love to ride. In the winter, there is a toboggan ride 
next to the hotel which the older kids loved. The rooms are well designed, 
charming and spacious. With the cribs they deliver items to child-proof the 
room. The indoor hotel pool is sun-filled and perfect for adults and kids 
alike. The wonderful buffet breakfast with chocolate croissants, crepes and 
various treats was a highlight for my children and the service was impeccable. 
As a side trip we went to the Ice Hotel (do NOT stay there...we did and it was 
extreme camping at best with -10 temperatures at night. I thought my kids were 
going to get hypothermia). The design was incredible and there is an ice slide 
which is very entertaining. That village has wonderful adventure sports like 
dog-sledding, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling. There is a water park 
that they turn into a sledding park all winter which was incredible. This made 
Quebec a perfect destination for my family in February. Be sure to bring your 
warmest clothes! <br>

this rather large resort. Several restaurants to choose from although our 
experience was that the lunch options were better than the dinner selections. 
Close proximity to town (10 minute drive, $15 cab ride) makes this resort seem 
remote and serene, while easily accessible to the restaurants, bars, and cafes 
of Playa del Carmen. Excellent service throughout the resort. Try and select an

Miramar Beach Club with chairs, butler service, and sports rentals&#151;the

the extensive and creative activities for kids of all ages including unique and 
cultural programs like hula dancing and mask making. Every detail for kids has 
been thought of here - from swim diapers at the pool to customized special 
treats in the room; the result is parents are able to relax too and everyone 
enjoys the gorgeous grounds and amenities. There is a saltwater protected 
lagoon with over 4,000 tropical fish which was great for snorkeling without 
surf. The food is excellent with a fresh breakfast buffet we all loved. The 
hotel is luxurious but not pretentious, key for a family-friendly atmosphere.

Half Moon is a large 
400 acre plantation style property that surprisingly feels intimate. There are 
many beach and pool areas to enjoy. The Caribbean beaches with warm blue waters 
are calm enough to be able to lie on a float and relax. The resort has many 
onsite activities including horseback riding (even in the water), water sports, 
tennis, exercise room, golf and a fabulous new spa. Accommodation options 
include 4-7 bedroom villas that come fully staffed with a housekeeper, cook and

Hawks Cay is an all 
around great hotel option for kids of all ages. We liked it so much we went 
there three years in a row. There is a terrific pool area with a pirate ship 
and slide that is perfect young kids and a flexible kids program where there is 
always some kind of activity happening like painting and games. There are hotel 
rooms and villa units available. We opted for the villa as they are 
well-appointed and spacious for families. The property also features tennis, a 
marina, and an onsite dolphin adventure program. We love that Hawks Cay is 
small enough so kids can have a bit of independence and walk around on their 
own. It is also in a convenient location to explore Key West and other fun 
Florida Keys attractions. <br>

Set in the gorgeous Val 
d'Orcia, in close proximity to the wonderful hilltop towns of Pienza, 
Montalcino, and Montepulciano, Adler-Thermae is a thermal spa resort that 
combines Zen sensibilities with Tuscan charm and hospitality. The therapeutic

vacation. In addition to the beautiful regular pool, which includes a circular 
&quot;rapids&quot; area, there is a second pool with therapeutic thermal water 
pumped in from the local hot springs. Glorious Tuscan herbal saunas are 
included in the room price. Other spa treatments are extra, such as couples mud 
treatments, a Dead Sea grotto, massage, facials, etc. The resort offers daily 
Yoga, exercise classes and even mountain biking and hiking through the Tuscan 
hills. Excursions to wineries are offered, as well as evening 
&quot;tastings&quot; in the bar. The food is great and abundant. A brilliant 
concept of this property is the inclusion of a phenomenal kids program which 
provides children their own spa experience as well as swimming, sports. yoga, 
crafts, drama, hiking, baking, and field trips to the thermal hot springs and a 
local cheese farm. There is also a teens' club and babysitting for infants and 
toddlers. My 3 month old loved her own spa treatment: an infant massage and 
bath in milk and honey. My school aged kids loved that they got to make friends 
with children from all over Europe. In the evenings the children could have 
supervised dinner and a movie while the grown-ups had an elegant dinner. All 
were blissfully happy. <br>

Lamanai offers small 
cabanas with thatched roofs in a jungle setting. Cabanas have ceiling fans, 
indoor plumbing and double beds on wooden frames with very comfortable 
mattresses. Lighted pathways lead to the open air dining room where all meals 
are communal but not family style. The property has lush vegetation, and paths 
that lead into the jungle where you can see and hear howler monkeys, beautiful 
birds and wonderful Mayan ruins. It is very civilized but kids can still swing 
on vines and feel like Tarzan! You are also allowed to climb some of the ruins 
which was great for all. The views were beautiful. Lamanai is rustic but 
upscale for anyone who wants a &quot;jungle experience&quot;. <br>

have a kids&#146; club or other kid-centric amenities, the ideal guest room 
set-up, warm service, and convenient location make it work well for families

the ski area. The property is set right on Mirror Lake with a private beach. 
There are a million activities to choose from through every season in this 
area. Rooms are spacious and there is an indoor pool that the boys loved to use 
after skiing. Public areas are family-oriented, warm, and inviting and the

Montestigliano is a 
typical turn-of-the-century Italian property that retains its charm because of 
smart renovation. It is comprised of a variety of apartments and villas, each 
with its own design. The grounds are spread out which means that even when it's 
fully booked there is a feeling of privacy. Individual apartments have their 
own patio with an adjacent grassy area and rooms feature a mix of antiques and 
practical furnishings. Kitchens are well-equipped and if there is anything you 
need the owners will get it for you. The location of Montestigliano, away from 
major roads and close to a small village, means that older kids can open the 
apartment door and go - there is plenty of walking, hiking and biking in the 
surrounding area. Pottery and cooking classes are offered in the summer when 
there are enough kids. Dinner, served one night a week, is high class and 
recommended - the owners participate and the chef is great. Overall, there is a 
cozy, family atmosphere due to the very helpful owners that make guests feel 
like they are at home. <br>

Mystic River Resort is located 7 miles from San Ignacio and Santa

nothing. The service is bar none, one of the best I've ever encountered. We 
spent 4 nights there recently with our three school-aged children who range 
between 9 and 14 years. The crew at Mystic River did everything possible to 
make our children feel welcome. From the private tour the first evening with 
Tom to the special meals and great child friendly guides, we felt spoilt the 
whole time! They are currently building two bedroom accommodations. The single 
only drawback was that we were all in one large single room, but honestly, we 
were so exhausted most nights, going to bed with the kids was easy. <br>

old-fashioned hotel atmosphere with a huge lounge where they can play games in 
front of the fire. Over the winter months, there&#146;s a shuttle available to 
take guests the ski hill; we&#146;re comfortable having our older boys use the 
shuttle on their own, so we aren&#146;t constantly driving them around. This 
means independence for them and a break for us. The food is excellent at the

on a family vacation. Johnny and Pamela are great local guides for sites and 
great food. The best part for the kids was that their daughter, Alaia, who

time with them couldn't have been better. They are interesting, knowledgeable,

<br>The resort was lovely and exceeded our expectations. We all loved it, 
especially our grandchildren ages 3, 5 and 6. It is set on 240 acres in the 
desert, centrally located at the foot of Mount San Jacinto. The resort has 
undergone a multi-million dollar makeover, and has many things to offer: three 
pools, a jacuzzi, a 27 hole golf course, 25 tennis courts, a spa with its own 
pool, children's camp, a water fantasy land called Splashtopia - a neat aquatic 
playground including a lazy river, two 100 foot water slides, and a small sand

A week at Red Horse 
Ranch was one of the best family vacations we've ever taken. The accommodations 
were not fancy, rather they were true to the spirit of the West! The range of 
activities, including horse back riding, mountain biking, kayaking, challenge 
courses, camp fires, archery ... kept us busy. The ratio of staff to guest was 
excellent and the ranch host was eager accommodate us and to customize our 
vacation to meet our needs! We choose activities that suited our interests, 
ages, skill level ... We met fabulous people from all over the world and will 
surely return to Red Horse Mountain next summer. <br>

Renvyle is in a truly stunning location

single-lane, rural roads to get here - Renvyle is about 90 minutes (by car) 
west of Galway City, just outside Clifden in Connemara. The stark scenery is 
breathtaking and the destination truly worth the effort. There are an 
incredible number of things to do on and off property including fishing, 
tennis, golf, a playground, and kids club for ages 4-14 that runs during 
holiday periods. Our family apartment (no kitchen) was simple but spacious and 
comfortable. The onsite restaurant is delicious. <br>

The Roberts

beach is shallow with small waves and beach toys. We like the 2-bedroom units 
with kitchens and hammocks for families; located close to the beach, they have 
roof-top hot tubs and wonderful views. The staff is accommodating and focused 
on making sure kids feel welcome and have fun at the property. The restaurant 
is laid-back and has indoor and outdoor sections so kids can easily come and go.

for adults to enjoy themselves while kids are having a blast. The setting is 
gorgeous with scrub oak-covered hills&#151;even without the animals it is a 
fantastic place. Riding in the jeep is a huge thrill for kids. The giraffes are 
incredible and there are some fascinating animals that I&#146;ve never seen 
before. Little details are done very well&#151;there is an outdoor BBQ for 
meals with a grassy area where kids can run around while adults sip wine. The

we also appreciated the close proximity to a grocery store with organic produce

resorty, but it is kid-friendly and relaxing. The staff is warm and helpful.

are every time we come back and we are completely comfortable leaving the kids 
on their own when they want to be. The concierge always helps us with fun

every need and desire was handled immediately with a smile and attention to 
detail. We had our own &#147;butler&#148; for the tent&#151;by the end of the 
week he was part of the family. As far as activities go, there was never a dull 
moment from horseback riding, ATV drives, fishing, and skeet shooting to name a

remain one of my most treasured memories! <br>

The Somerset is a special place. Staying at 
this resort feels like you are on your own private tropical island getaway 
featuring luxurious condo-style rooms with gourmet kitchens and plenty of space 
for families. Kid-friendly but not kid-centric, amenities for families include 
a holiday period kids&#146; club, floaties for the pool, and best of all, staff 
that goes out of their way to make every age feel pampered and comfortable. The 
atmosphere is intimate and relaxing&#151;a very different experience than 
staying at a busy, mega-hotel. The pool, while not large, is perfect for kids. 
The beach and setting are insanely beautiful. Fabulous housekeeping service in 
every condo means parents get a break too. <br>

This upscale hotel 
makes everyone feel welcome. We easily got an early check in (to make naptime), 
carried nothing but our son to the room and found a nice crib with brand new 
linens, baby toiletries and a stuffed animal in our room. The bathrooms are 
large enough to put the crib inside affording grown-ups privacy. Located South 
of Market, this is an easy walk to adult play (restaurants, bars and shopping) 
as well as kid play (Metreon, carousel, gardens). It's also a doable walk to 
Market street to pick up a cable car and to The Embarcadero to check out the 
Ferry Building. Food's terrific as is the service. <br>

Located in the heart of 
The Village at Mammoth, the condo guest rooms rooms at The Village Lodge 
provide the space and amenities families need, with convenient access to 
everything including the gondola. We love that the village is always lively 
with jazz and music festivals in the summer and s&#146;mores by the fire in 
winter. In addition to the phenomenal skiing in this area, there is a zip-line, 
mountain adventure center, and mountain bike riding over summer months. Great 
restaurants are within walking distance and there are also grocery stores 
nearby. Kids under 5 ski free at on the magic carpet at the resort and the ski 
school is terrific. <br>

We 
had an incredible experience here. Guest units are standalone with 
air-conditioning. The food was phenomenal. The area is not touristy and the 
hotel arranged fabulous local tours - a chocolate farm, local tribes (they 
loved our blond son!) and local beaches. Not much to do on the immediate island 
outside of kayaking, fishing, and snorkeling. The staff is great with kids and 
very accommodating. <br>

This picturesque Alpine-style hotel feels like it is 
straight out of Austria. Handcrafted d&eacute;cor, toasty fires, and 
exceptional service create a warm and cozy atmosphere for all ages at The Trapp

cross country skiing to a rustic cabin for lunch, to downhill skiing in Stowe, 
to swimming in their indoor pool, to participating in their kids&#146; club and 
activities (not to mention a long list of wonderful summer activities too). The 
History Tour of the Von Trapp Family is a highlight &#150; it&#146;s 
fascinating to learn first-hand details about this iconic family portrayed in 
the The Sound of Music. There are a few onsite restaurants to choose from 
including formal and casual options; the meals are outstanding. <br>

We had a phenomenal stay 
at the Trump Hotel in Chicago. Our kids loved the Trump Kids program featuring 
a kid&#146;s concierge, welcome gift, mini-robes, video games, and personalized 
kid &#145;business cards&#146;. The contemporary suites and rooms are 
beautifully done with top-notch beds, linens, and bath amenities. The excellent 
service at this hotel extends to the restaurant with stunning lake, river, and 
downtown views from the floor-to-ceiling windows. There&#146;s a terrific 
indoor pool&#151;the highlight for our kids&#151;and a nice work out facility

This classic hotel on 
Oahu's North Shore has something for everyone in the family (especially for 
those who golf or surf). A kid-friendly swimming beach with restaurant, 
showers, volleyball, and other luxuries, large central pool, children's pool 
with water slide and adjacent family jacuzzi, a separate more grown-up jacuzzi 
with views of the bay, poolside bar, tennis, horseback riding, two golf 
courses, kid-friendly dining, and recently refurbished rooms in the main hotel 
large enough to accommodate a family of four in a double room. If you would 
like more room, beachfront cottages and nicely-appointed villas are also 
available. Given the choice, I would choose the cottages over the villas they 
are closer to the main hotel, pool, and tennis and have a nicer view. <br>

I discovered this boutique hotel 
while traveling on business. I immediately brought my family here for a long 
weekend. We love it, and continue to come as often as possible.The hotel is 
pristine and inviting as soon as you enter the lobby. The rooms, which are 
mostly suites, have upscale white linen decor, but also happen to be 
comfortable. The 2 and 3 bedroom suites are magnificent. The food is very good, 
both poolside and in the dining room. The pool and beach are well groomed and 
not very crowded. There's a small gym on site. Most impressive of all, is the 
staff. They are helpful, friendly, attentive and genuinely interested in making 
your stay a memorable one. My son will remember his 10th birthday forever, 
thanks to the thoughtfulness of 2 of the employees at the Vero Beach Hotel. <br>

The position of this 
hotel in a forest above a village is magical. The landscape is gorgeous. Over 
the years, we&#146;ve grown to love the family that runs Waldhaus Sils, the 
staff, and the people that go there. This is not one of those &#147;kids&#148; 
hotels where you are surrounded by animation. Children are welcome and there 
are many activities offered to them, but it is all very low-key. The atmosphere 
is friendly and the food is excellent. The details here are handled with care 
and everything runs smoothly, this is why the same families love to come back 
year after year. <br>

configuration in these guest units is ideal. Beach toys are provided on arrival 
and the restaurant is clearly experienced in hosting families. Young kids will 
appreciate the small beach and playground nearby, and since the hotel is just

Set on 113 acres and bordered by a 
4,000-acre wildlife sanctuary - guests have many activities to choose from here 
from bike riding to hiking to hot air ballooning. Rooms are themed with many 
creative options including a treehouse perched 30 feet off the ground. The 
staff was great and very welcoming. Having an onsite babysitter was just 
amazing, this enabled my husband and I to go to the spa and have a couples 
massage and then enjoy an evening with other adults. We took the onsite family 
cooking class with the Executive Chef and the Pastry Chef - my family learned 
how to make homemade pasta as well as cupcakes. The ponds on the property are 
fun for young kids. Winvian is overall a magical place! <br>
