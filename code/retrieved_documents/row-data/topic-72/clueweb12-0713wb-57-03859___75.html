from the closing-up dept.  An 
anonymous reader writes<i>&quot;From the MySQL User's Conference, Sun has 
announced, and former CEO Marten Mickos has confirmed, that Sun will beclose 
sourcing sections of the MySQL code base. Sun will begin with close sourcing 
the backup solutions to MySQL, and will continue with more advanced features. 
With Oracle owningInnodb, and it being GPL, does this mean that MySQL will be 
removing it to introduce these features? Sun has had a very poor history of 
actuallyopen sourcing anything.&quot;</i>

 I used to be one of MySQL's vociferous defenders, arguing that 
speed, ease of use, quality of documentation, and the size of the community 
made up for its limitations relative to PostgreSQL. But this is pretty much the 
end. Sun is clearly determined to destroy whatever's good about it. For small, 
lightweight projects, SQLite is the way to go, and for anything bigger, 
PostgreSQL is now the clear choice. I guess it's time to see if PostgreSQL's 
documentation and tools have managed to get any less user-hostile over the 
years.<br>
<br>
The one remaining question is mindshare. For example, pretty 
much every ISP offers MySQL as part of a basic hosting package. No one's saying 
they have to stop doing that, but are they going to start offering other open 
source DBMSs in the same way now? I sure hope so. Parent Share twitter facebook

I've been 
using PostgreSQL on-and-off for about 7 years now, and I have to say: it's 
*all* gotten a lot better.<br>

In fact, feel free to check out (I think 
it's on Safari) how slick things have gotten, try Korry Douglas' book (forgot

(like clustering, failover, etc).<br>

<p></p>  Are you seriously complaining about the fact that 3rd party tools 
don't give you WYSIWYG support for triggers, something that you can control 
entirely by simply writing a query? No. I'm complaining about the fact that, 
for example, phpMySql requires you to type the following to view the triggers 
on your database:
<p></p> 
<blockquote> SELECT TRIGGER_NAME, EVENT_MANIPULATION, EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE, 
ACTION_STATEMENT<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS<br>
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA='dbname'; <br>
</blockquote> Let alone, 
ALTER/UPDATE statements.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, here's what I do in 
phpPgAdmin: click Table, click Triggers. There's a list. I can edit it by 
clicking on a specific trigger. phpMySql has no such interface to triggers, and 
every view, creation and edit must be done by manually typing in the SQL (but, 
based on the tone of your reply, I'm sure you knew that). Maybe you have time 
for that, and it's not a big concern (on what terms do you get paid?). For any 
serious database development, it strikes me as a grotesque waste of time.
<p></p>  I mean, seriously, the CREATE TRIGGER statement is not rocket science.
 Nobody implied that it was. However, complex trigger statements are what beget 
the necessity of being able to edit them handily- something that I would 
imagine you couldn't do with a WYSIWYG (exactly what would a WYSIWYG TRIGGER 
editor do, anyway?). Wasting 15-20 minutes typing the SELECT/CREATE/ALTER 
TRIGGERS statement in another editor and then running a blanket update over the 
whole SQL database strikes me as fundamentally wrong, especially where there is 
a trivial and effective interface in phpPgAdmin.
<p></p>  Besides, creating them programatically is just better business. I can 
keep a db_setup_triggers.sql in source control and make it part of automatic 
builds. Who ever suggested or implied that you wouldn't create them 
programatically? Please, feel free to describe how else you would do it.
<p></p>  MySQL is far from perfect. But to criticize it for THIS?  I think 
you're fundamentally confused about what I was criticizing, meaning you either 
did not take the time to read my comments, are ignorant of MySql/phpMySql, 
and/or didn't take the time to think about either before you started ranting. 
If that be the case and you are fundamentally confused, you've contributed 
little if anything to the discussion, sounded condescending, acted 
presumptuously, and been indignant about something that does not even exist (a 
criticism about the lack of a TRIGGER WYSIWYG, the very suggestion of which 
reeks of ignorance). If indeed that is the case, next time you consider writing 
something, perhaps you could do us all a favour and not.<br>

 Having 
a good bit of experience with both, I'd say that the documentation and overall 
support structure for PG is about the same as MySQL these days.<br>
<br>
The 
only caveat that typically hangs up new users (especially ones coming from a 
MySQL background) and is not particularly clearly documented is the default 
authentication mechanism.<br>
<br>
By default (at least on many distributions), 
Postgres uses &quot;ident&quot; authentication, which means no password is 
required for database logins on a local socket. What *is* required, on the 
other hand, is that you must be logged in/running as the UNIX user of same 
name. Obviously this poses problems for webapps that want their own database 
user and is generally just very confusing for users who are used to the 
database having its own independent set of usernames and passwords (which 
Postgres still does, for remote connections... causing further confusion)<br>

<br>Of course, like any good database Postgres will be more than happy to 
handle its own user authentication entirely natively, you simply have touse md5 
instead of ident in pg_hba.conf [google.ca] <br>

<br>All the community, documentation, and speed in the world wont make up for 
lack of features.<br>
<br>
I'm no dbms expert but when I first started learning 
about relation databases, wow, seems like 6+ years ago now, it was obvious from 
reading the features of mysql versus postgresql that there was no making up for 
the fact that mysql wasn't a real relational database. Since I was learning 
about relational databases I never even bothered with mysql and jumped right 
into postgresql. So I guess I'm biased but I never ran into a problem with 
tools, libraries, documentation, or community support.<br>
<br>
Mysql has made 
many improvements since then, and I even started to play with it as I've been 
working on some open source projects which are web based applications and as 
such may need to support the widely popular mysql. So far its not bad, but it 
would be nice if their mysql command line tool would do TAB completion as psql 
does. It always takes me a few tabs before I realize that mysql isn't going to 
help my lazy ass out.<br>

 When I was doing my second-year undergrad database coursework (2001) it was 
possible in Postgres but impossible in MySQL because MySQL didn't support 
foreign keys. It's pretty much impossible to define nontrivial relations 
without foreign keys, or to get much beyond first normal form. I hear MySQL now 
has support for foreign keys, but I'd much rather use a database that has had 
this kind of core functionality for well over a decade than one that has 
recently bolted it on top of a flawed design. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

you can take Postgres, close source it, and improve it to the extend that 
people would pay for it, then good luck to you (but I don't see it happening ;)

 For the web I started off with Postgres but eventually 
had to move to MySQL because it has such wide support, but as I use InnoDB I've 
grown more and more uneasy at seeing Oracle and Sun buy off chunks of MySQL.<br>
 Even putting aside any arguments about performance/features (not that Postgres 
is bad in this regard), PostgreSQL would be better as an FOSS DB standard, just 
because there wouldn't be any worries about license/ownership instability.<br>

<b>However</b>, before we go nuts with Postgres love, I think it's 
safe to say Sun won't be close sourcing MySQL to a damaging degree; that'd be 
like killing the goose that lays the golden egg.<br>
 The reason MySQL is so 
valuable is because of its wide usage, and they'll want to use that to their 
advantage in more subtle ways than close sourcing and cashing in. The comments

You need to get a grip and possibly read for

<br>
Sun is saying that they may (not yet 
decided) offer some add on components to mySQL backup that may (not yet 
decided) use a license other than GPL. The add on in question will be 
integrated through a backup API mySQL has for exactly this purpose (to enable 
3rd party extended backup solutions).<br>
<br>
What exactly do see wrong with 
that? First, nothing precludes building open source backup solutions for this 
API and nothing precludes other 3rd parties from building other solutions. Why 
should Sun not have the same right?<br>

 sqlite is a very simple single user db. It's easy to 
integrate and because it doesn't need a server, works extremely well where 
you'd like to use SQL but don't need a heavy database. It's not even in the 
same target application space as MySql.<br>
<br>
MySql is a full fledged 
client/server database and *should* support referential integrity properly. Of 
course its biggest problem is licensing - you can only use mysql with 100% GPL 
applications (unless you're prepared to pay $200/user for the client licenses, 
or stick to the 3.23 client which is the last free to use version), which 
limits it somewhat.. TBH given that restriction I'm really surprised web hosts 
still ship it, as they're opening themselves up to all sorts of liability 
issues if one of their customers uses/builds a non-gpl app using it.<br>
<br>

Postgresql is basically mysql without all the silly politics.<br>

 but it's 
backwards of the Red Hat way. With Fedora, Red Hat lets the community run the 
roost and run whatever crazy things are cool on the tubes. They reserve RHEL 
for the cleaned up professional version that has what paying customers NEED and 
they support it. The community gets the warty version with all the lumps in 
return for it being free.<br>

Sun wants to treat MySQL like a product. 
They want to give away the &quot;free&quot; version as a stripped down 
marketing tool. They want to put new code in Enterprise first, where fewer 
people will see it. The current model is that Enterprise is MORE stable and 
less agressive. The value of the GPL version is that lots of people put up with 
warts because it's free... paying customers won't do that by a long shot. The 
first time a nasty data killing bug shows up for the top paying customers 
they'll all jump ship for Sun not testing better. Parent Share twitter facebook

<p></p> 
<p> Yes, this is what Oracle does with Berkeley DB. On one project, we started 
out with using Berkeley DB. It wasn't meeting the needs, so we started looking 
at other options. Oracle had us hooked, and started reeling us in. Up until we 
got to the price tag. They wouldn't offer the support that we needed for their 
commercial version of Berkely DB, and instead wanted to push us towards their 
full Oracle DB. It sounded fine until we got to the price. They wanted, get 
this, 5% of the gross revenues of the product we were designing!!! Not a 
per-license fee, not a large finite sum for the product, but a full 5% of the 
revenues.</p> 
<p> Needless to say, we told them to take a hike. </p> 
<p> This is different than from a few years ago. Then they were willing to do 
a per license fee. But, of course, at an astronomical amount. Plus, this amount 
would literally change each time we talked to a different salesperson. There 
was a lot of confusion at the time. Now they've eliminated the confusion, but 
their greed knows no bounds.</p> 
<p> Sun is welcome in this space, IMHO. More competition is good, because 
frankly, all of the vendors have serious drawbacks in one way or another.</p> 
<p> The moral of the story is be real careful about the database you select, 
and your design. If you choose foolishly, you'll end up spending lots of money, 
when a better design could have saved you from this pain.</p> Parent Share

Thanks for all your comments on our business model. I wanted to present here 
the quick facts around this to avoid misunderstandings:<br>
<br>
In 6.0 there 
will be native backup functionality in the server available for anyone and all 
(Community, Enterprise) under GPL.<br>
<br>
Additionally we will develop 
high-end add-ons (such as encryption, native storage engine-specific drivers) 
that we will deliver to customers in the MySQL Enterprise product only. We have 
not yet decided under what licence we will release those add-ons (GPL, some 
other FOSS licence, and/or commercial).<br>
<br>
Because the main backup 
functionality goes into the main server under GPL, anyone can of course use the 
api and build their own add-ons or other modifications.<br>

 Thanks for all 
the comments on this. We are listening attentively. Let me clarify some facts:
<br> <br>
* The business decision on this was made by MySQL AB (by me as the 
then CEO) prior to the acquisition by Sun, so this has nothing to do with Sun. 
On the contrary, Sun is more likely to influence this decision the other way.
<br> <br>
* It is not a quesiton of close sourcing any existing code, nor 
anything in the core server. Everything we have released under GPL continues to 
be under GPL, and the core server will always be under GPL (or some other FOSS 
licence).<br>
<br>
* We will introduce backup functionality for all users 
(Community and Enterprise) under GPL in version 6.0.<br>
<br>
* Additionally we 
will develop high-end add-ons (such as encryption, native storage 
engine-specific drivers) that we will deliver to customers in the MySQL 
Enterprise product only. We have not yet decided under what licence we will 
release those add-ons (GPL, some other FOSS licence, and/or commercial).<br>

<br>* At all times, because the main backup functionality goes into the core 
server under GPL, anyone can of course use the api and build their own add-ons 
or other modifications.<br>
<br>
Those are the facts on this. The interesting 
topic is of course the one of the business model and what the best business 
model for FOSS software is. I hope to cover that in a separate posting.<br>
<br>
In all of this, you have our undivided continued commitment to providing a 
fantastic and complete MySQL server under GPL for anyone to download and use. 
If we for whatever reason would not do that, we would risk losing users to 
other open source databases or risk seeing a fork of our own product. This is 
the power of open source.<br>

But we are not absolutely certain that this is 
the case, and so we are experimenting with other models. We believe that a DBMS 
behaves somewhat differently in the market compared to an operating system. We 
believe that Red Hat's competitive situation is different from ours. And we are 
not fully convinced that Red Hat gets a fair compensation in the market for 
their enormous (and great) investments and contributions.<br>

<h4>MySQL &amp; FOSS  (Score:5, Insightful)</h4> by martenmickos (467191)  
writes:  on Wednesday April 16 2008, @08:31PM (#23098824) <br>
 All, <br>
<br>

I tried to clarify the facts in another posting a moment ago: 
http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=525246&amp;cid=23098626<br>
<br>

Here I will discuss the business model considerations, MySQL's commitment to 
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and why we made the decision we made.<br>

<br>First and foremost: we at MySQL firmly believe that open source is a 
superior way of producing software. You get better quality faster, and you 
often get better innovation too.<br>
<br>
So it is not lightly that we have 
decided a few times to produce non-open software, such as the MySQL Monitor 
introduced some years ago. So why do we do that?<br>
<br>
The reason is that we 
have an ambition not only to produce FOSS code, but also to be a profitable 
business that can exist for a long time. Each time we make more money, we hire 
more developers to develop GPL code.<br>
<br>
If the world were perfect, we 
would only produce GPL code and we would have a great business that cna fund 
the software development. But we have found that the world is not perfect. We 
have been experimenting with a variety of business models around FOSS (dual 
licensing, support only, simple subscriptions, different binaries for community 
and enterprise, non-open source features) to find the best one. And we will 
continue to experiment until we are satisfied. We need to find a model that 
allows us to produce a ton of great code under GPL while having the financial 
strength to do all this.<br>
<br>
To get to this goal of ours, we believe we 
have to be more pragmatic than dogmatic. Call it a necessary evil if you like. 
Having production add-ons that we provide only to paying customers currently 
seems to use to be a useful model. Our partners and customers think it is 
great. Many users think it is great. But not all do (as evident from this 
thread on /.). I would hope we could please all, but I am afraid we cannot. <br>
<br>In all of this - i.e. as we experiment with open source business models (as 
there aren't really any role models bigger than ourselves that we could learn 
from) - we remain fully committed to producing the core database server always 
under the GPL (or some other approved FOSS licence).<br>
<br>
In this work, we 
feel we have been able to produce enormous benefits to the world in the form of 
GPL software. The MySQL server could not have evolved as much as it did (not 
that I am saying it has evolved perfectly) if we hadn't had a revenue stream to 
fund the hiring of developers and others. We have open sourced MySQL Cluster 
which was an advanced closed-source database engine at Ericsson. We open 
sourced the Falcon storage engine.<br>
<br>
I can appreciate that many of you 
are upset with our decisions. It has happened before that the community has 
been upset with us. But I hope that you can see that<br>
<br>
* we are trying 
to be fully open and transparent with our decision-making in these areas<br>

<br>* we have a full commitment to produce the core MySQL server under GPL <br>

<br>* we are actively listening to your input <br>
<br>
We can probably not 
please all, but you should know that we are trying to serve our community. We 
are immensely thankful for all the support and contributions that we have 
received in our 13-year history. We are hoping that we are good stewards of the 
MySQL phenomenon, and we hope that you can come to terms with the fact that we 
find revenue generation a vital part of our mission.<br>
<br>
We may not have 
come up with the perfect business model yet (and perhaps the decision that is 
here being debated was utterly stupid), but we are determined to continue to 
seek the perfect business model for open source software so that we can 
continue to exist and be strong, and so that other software entrepreneurs can 
learn from our successes and mistakes.<br>
<br>
Finally, please note that this 
entire decision and reasoning is something we developed on our own at MySQL AB 
several months ago, before being acquired by Sun. Sun has not asked us to do 
this or that. Or in fact, Sun has asked us the opposite - i.e. whether we 
should not Read the rest of this comment... <br>

 Of course open source 
licenses allow for some code and features to be released from the open source 
license by paying off the developers who developed the code and having them 
sign a contract. In that way their open source developments pay off and they 
can finally earn an income for their hard work.<br>
<br>
What the community 
doesn't seem to get is that this is basically creating two versions of the same 
product. One open sourced and one closed source. It is basically forking off a 
closed source version and paying off developers to release it so they are 
finally paid for their hard work and years dedicated to writing code. Just that 
the open source version now doesn't have the same code and features as the new 
closed source version has. But that wouldn't stop open source developers from 
writing new code to put features back in the open source version. As long as it 
doesn't use source code from the closed source fork of it. For example this was 
done to WINE to create Crossover Office, WINEX/Cediga, et all. Also Red Hat 
Enterprise is different from Red Hat Fedora. Just that one version went 
commercial and the other went open source.<br>
<br>
As an open source developer 
you actually want this to happen, so that all of your hard work is paid off 
finally. You want a company to buy out your work and pay you for it eventually. 
That doesn't make you selfish and it doesn't make you greedy either. I mean you 
spend years supporting the open source community for free and writing a lot of 
code without even being paid for it. So they really can't say you haven't given 
anything to the open source community. While people jokingly call open source 
developers as communists or hippies, in reality they are capitalists at heart. 
In the end they want equal pay for equal work. Open source projects are a good 
way to market their skills and show off their coding abilities and ability to 
work in a team. Plus it gives back to the community in free software. But the 
time will come eventually when some company decides the project is good enough 
to license and use in a commercial project so they sell their rights to it for 
money. Most of the time that doesn't happen and it continues to be unsupported 
and open source developers have friends and family members wondering if they 
are insane, doing all of that hard work for free and it looks like they are 
throwing away money or flushing it down the toilet.<br>
<br>
There will still 
be an open source version of MySQL, just that parts of it got spun off into a 
closed source commercial version. I did a lot of research into open source 
business plans myself in college. You try to earn money via charging for tech 
support or donations, failing that you try to get some company like Sun to buy 
your code and pay off your developers to release the code from open source. But 
some open source companies sell t-shirts and stuffed animals and other stuff. 
Any way you look at it, it is still capitalism and still a company trying to 
earn a profit. You still have stock holders who want a return on their 
investments. You still have employees that expect a paycheck. It may be free 
software, but people aren't really writing it for free, they expect a payoff 
sooner or later. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

 The title of this 
article is a bit dramatic and incorrect. There is nothing in the story about 
the core MySQL engine being moved from open source to a closed source mentioned 
in the story. Rather a fancy new backup add-on is being released to Enterprise 
edition, and possibly added to the community version later.<br>
<br>
MySQL is 
one of the most popular open source products out there, but they get lambasted 
if they create an add-on and want to actually get paid for it. Too many ppl 
react as if they are defecating on a holy shrine in the land of FOSS.<br>
<br>

The title of this article and some of the reactions here strikes me a chicken 
little &quot;the sky is falling&quot; BS. I love open source software and the 
general movement, but I hate it when people jump to conclusions like this... 
and jumping to conclusions like this seems to happen all to often by ppl on /. 
and the open source community in general. I'd like to see more people showing 
respect for a company that has done so much for open source and respect the 
fact that they deserve to actually make a little money along the way.<br>
<br>

I can't help but wonder how many of the people, who treat this story like the 
evil Sun is going ruin MySQL, run MySQL but haven't open sourced the programs 
that they've written that access the database... I'd bet a hell of a lot of 
closed source programs use MySQL as their database... should we scream at them

 We do get to keep what we made. If it's under the 
GPL, we can always fork it into a new Open Source product called OurSQL. It's 
just that we won't be able to integrate any of their proprietary new features 
that are NOT under the GPL. But, hey, who needs 'em for that? If Open Source 
could get it this far, odds are good Open Source can do even more. Parent Share

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think MySQL ever had an open source 
developer community. It was developed by a company and released as an open 
source product. Unlike PostgreSQL, which really is developed by a community of 
developers.

<p></p>  The GCC/EGCS fork worked because most of the developers went with the 
EGCS. That fork worked because the GCC mainline was dead *and* the people doing 
all the real work were the ones who created EGCS. Indeed, what is now called 
&quot;GCC&quot; is the offspring of EGCS, the orignal GCC was killed.<br>

No comment regarding XFree86/Xorg.<br>

No comment regarding the 
Emacs/XEmacs fork, except to point out that there was an earlier fork called 
Epoch made in the version 18 days and that didn't go anywhere. I used it for a 
time in 1990 and preferred it to straight Emacs 18.<br>
<br>
The only other 
major fork I can think of would be the *BSD forks, Open, Net and Free.<br>
<br>

Successful forking is very rare and requires a truly dedicated developer 
community or large corporate backing to pull it off. Out of the few examples 
listed one of them was not a fork at all, but a coup and resulted in the death 
of the parent. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

What about the Compiz, Beryl, Fusion fiasco? That was a fork, merge, 
(branch?)... I've got svn repos with less confusing trees, for craps sake! 
Granted, it only lasted, what a couple of months or so, and I'm glad that every 
was able to humble themselves and work it all out... but it still was a fiasco!

The only thing that 
Sun will achieve in this change is a fork... Maybe that was the plan all 
along... The founders of MySQL AB get their big checks, and then create a new 
company with a forked version of MYSQL.. Brilliant!!! :) <br>

 Sun will only develop and release 
certain features in the Enterprise version, specifically relating to online 
backup, management, and other advanced features. What's in the current version 
stays in the current version, but they will phase out those features in the 
community branch. Someone can still port them from the old version, but even 
then, we won't get the benefit of Sun's new developments. Parent Share twitter

<p></p>  It's not that they're phasing them out of the GPL'd branch; these are 
new features that were never GPL'd in the first place. Ah, well that's not so 
bad then. Their money, their choice. Plenty of companies do that and we don't 
generally come down on them.
