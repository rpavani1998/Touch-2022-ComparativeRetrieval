<p><b>New loan keeps clinic to April 1; EMS defended </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center will remain open as a primary care 
clinic until March 31 when contracts with physicians expire.</p> 
<p>A $150,000 loan extended against 2005 tax dollars, secured from Citizens 
Bank last week , is the buoy.</p> 
<p>What to do next is the repair still weighing down the Upper San Juan Health 
Service District.</p> 
<p>Board member Jerry Valade said a total of $200,000 has now been extended to 
the district from the bank with the promise it could be recouped once tax 
checks reach district coffers. The agreement is to pay off half the loan in 
March and the other half, plus interest of about $2,000, in May. After basic 
needs are met, any remaining loan money would be used to decrease overdue bills 
sitting at about $200,000.</p> 
<p>From there, Valade worked with a committee appointed at the end of January 
to come up with a short-term model that might carry the limping district ahead.
</p> 
<p>To stay in the black, he said, the medical center requires an estimated 
$11,000 more each month in income. By placing the building in caretaker status 
- paying only the bills necessary to prevent degradation of the existing 
structure and offering no services - the district would come out with about 
$200,000 in 2005. Added emergency medical services expenses could gobble up 
$112,000 of that, still leaving the district about $85,000 ahead.</p> 
<p>Valade cautioned the board the model did not take into account current 
unpaid debt, the $40,000 the district promised to make a &quot;best 
effort&quot; to return to the Dr. Mary Fisher Foundation, expenses incurred 
employing a temporary EMS operations manager, pending employee settlements or 
employee buyouts necessary when the clinic closes.</p> 
<p>He also presented an outline of three motions designed to prevent closure 
of the medical center, starting with shifting tax money away from EMS to open 
as an emergency/urgent care facility starting April 1. As a consequence, EMS 
services would have to be reduced until either private or mill levy funds could 
be generated to offset costs.</p> 
<p>Even with the best possible model running the best possible way, he said, 
the district needs more money at the end of every day. &quot;I just don't think 
we have enough money to do what we want to do here,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Board members and audience members alike took exception to the idea of 
reducing EMS. Brian Sinnot, EMS committee chair, said the model for EMS 
services approved in July meets the district's basic needs and little else. To 
reduce those services would be &quot;patient detrimental,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>&quot;To do that and then go to the taxpayers after you've created a crisis 
situation is just wrong,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Board member Bob Scott also balked at the idea of increasing the mill levy.
</p> 
<p>&quot;In my mind we need a crystal-clear vision of where this thing is 
going and how we fix it before we do that,&quot; he said, advocating closing 
the clinic, continuing to support EMS, which is functioning fairly well, and 
working through financial and managerial issues until a model to meet the 
health care needs of the community and the financial restraints of the district 
could be designed.</p> 
<p>Dr. Dick Blide, another board member, said the discussion was &quot;putting 
the cart before the horse. We don't have enough money because we don't have 
enough patients.&quot; Improving patient numbers, both he and board member Dr. 
Jim Pruitt agreed, means bringing all the local physicians to the table to 
design a cooperative community health care system that serves the entire 
population.</p> 
<p>J.R. Ford said more services is the key, not more patients.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't see it as a volume issue at all,&quot; he said from the 
audience. &quot;If we go on the way we have been, collecting the bills, the 
last thing we want is more bills.&quot; Later in the meeting he suggested at 
least leasing out space in the medical center while the board considers 
restructuring options.</p> 
<p>Dr. Guy Paquet, the district's medical director, one of two physicians 
whose contracts expire March 31, said the area has more primary care doctors 
than needed. Based on population, with 2,500 patients required per primary care 
physician, he said, Pagosa Springs could support six physicians. Paquet counted 
eight including the two at the Mary Fisher Medical Center, plus a variety of 
alternative medicine practitioners.</p> 
<p>&quot;As long as people keep fighting amongst themselves, you'll never get 
anywhere,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Business manager Allen Hughes cautioned the board that closing the medical 
center even for a short time would require significant start-up costs, 
including three or four months of operating capital while rebuilding a patient 
base and restocking medical supplies.</p> 
<p>&quot;You're talking clients, we're talking community,&quot; Pruitt said, 
reminding Hughes that six members of the board ran on a platform that focused 
on ending competition between public and private health care clinics. The board 
spent several months in 2004 in negotiations with local physicians to contract 
for services with no success because of the financial woes.</p> 
<p>From the audience, Sinnot and Larry Escude of EMS, and Dave Bohl, financial 
committee chair, said it was time for the board to redesign the platform, set 
some attainable goals and begin working to reach those goals.</p> 
<p>&quot;It seems to me the key to this situation is that none of the medical 
groups are working together,&quot; Escude said. &quot;If they were working 
together and had a common goal, you guys would probably have one of the best 
health care systems in the area.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bohl said time to make such decisions is running short. &quot;You can't 
stay open past March 31 as you are now.&quot; A community of board members, 
citizens and physicians plan to meet tomorrow to discuss possible interim 
cooperative plans for the medical center. Board chairman Pam Hopkins said a 
decision regarding the short-term status of the medical center would most 
likely have to be made at a special meeting scheduled Feb. 15 at 7 p.m. at Fire 
Station 1.</p> 
<p>In the long term, the district board continues to look toward the 
feasibility of using the Mary Fisher Medical Center as a Critical Access 
Hospital - a federal designation that would allow them to recoup 101 percent of 
all Medicare charges.</p> 
<p>Sheldon Weisgrau, with Rural Health Consultants of Lawrence, Kan., is 
aiming to complete the grant-funded study some time around the end of April. Of 
the 2,200 small rural hospitals nationwide, he said, about 1,000 qualify as 
critical access hospitals.</p> 
<p>As far as timing goes, application and federal red tape take several 
months; the bigger issue will be, as always, funding for any required 
improvements, operations and staff.</p> 
<p>Weisgrau said, as with any rural health care facility, the ultimate keys to 
success will be &quot;strong management, support of the local physicians and 
support of the community.&quot;</p>

<p><b>'Conservative' county budget finalized</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>With the recent addition of a narrative from Bob Burchett, Archuleta County 
finance director, the 2005 county budget is now in final form.</p> 
<p>In summary, Burchett's narrative suggests this year's document has been 
prepared with a modest degree of cautious optimism.</p> 
<p>Says Burchett, &quot;Archuleta County, as well as the state of Colorado, 
has experienced a recent mild boost in economic growth during the latter part 
of 2004, and this gradual trend is anticipated to continue during 2005.&quot;
</p> 
<p>For example, &quot;a slight surge&quot; in sales tax revenue late last year 
is expected to maintain strength, and the county anticipates sales tax revenues 
this year will increase by nearly 8 percent over last year's estimated total of 
$1,274,000.</p> 
<p>At the same time, &quot;In a fiscal state environment characterized by 
program reductions, layoffs and the like, it is easy for us to emphasize that 
our circumstances are not as good as they could be nor as good as we would like 
them to be.&quot;</p> 
<p>As a result, &quot;Indeed, the reflection of this budget can be clearly 
characterized as 'defensive' or conservative,'&quot; says Burchett.</p> 
<p>The following are a few of the budget highlights discussed in Burchett's 
narrative.</p> 
<p>General Fund</p> 
<p>General Fund Revenues for fiscal year 2005 are estimated at $7,474,181, an 
increase of $865,109, or roughly 13 percent, over estimated revenues for 2004.
</p> 
<p>Property taxes are the primary source of revenues for the General Fund, and 
the corresponding, effective mill levy rate for 2005 is set at 19.751, up from 
last year's levy of 18.760.</p> 
<p>Based on an assessed county value of $199,958,860, the 19.751 levy rate 
will generate $3,949,387 in property tax revenues this year, with $3,106,761 
earmarked for the General Fund.</p> 
<p>Sales tax revenues are another key component of the General Fund, and the 
fund's revenues for this year are estimated at $1,375,000, equating to 50 
percent of total sales tax collected annually by the county.</p> 
<p>The remaining 50 percent of county sales tax revenues are allocated to the 
Road Capital Improvement Fund.</p> 
<p>General Fund expenditures for 2005 are budgeted at $7,800,007, which 
exceeds anticipated revenues by $325,826.</p> 
<p>However, &quot;This shortfall will be covered by existing unreserved fund 
balance accumulated in prior years,&quot; says Burchett.</p> 
<p>Road and Bridge Fund</p> 
<p>This year's Road and Bridge Fund revenues are estimated at $2,322,595, 
which reflects an increase of nearly 25 percent over projected 2004 revenues 
and a decrease of 1.6 percent of the 2004 budgeted amount.</p> 
<p>According to Burchett, &quot;The majority of this increase ... results from 
the anticipated increase of the Highway User Tax Fees for 2005,&quot; which is 
estimated at $1,346,000.</p> 
<p>That figure represents an increase of 27 percent over last year's estimate 
of $1,059,000.</p> 
<p>Road and Bridge Fund expenditures for 2005 are $1,060,130, a reduction of 
$90,406, or 7.9 percent, of 2004 budgeted expenditures of $1,150,536.</p> 
<p>&quot;The majority of these expenditures, $810,000 or 76.4 percent,&quot; 
says Burchett, &quot;are related to the operation and maintenance of 
county-owned machinery, equipment and vehicles.&quot;</p> 
<p>Capital projects</p> 
<p>This year's Capital Improvement Fund has one project budgeted - the 
extension of an existing sewer line &quot;approximately 4,400 lineal feet&quot; 
to the Extension building at the county fairgrounds.</p> 
<p>The project was initiated last year, and the budgeted amount for completion 
of the project amounts to $196,000.</p> 
<p>Enterprise funds</p> 
<p>The county has two business-type entities, or &quot;enterprise funds,&quot; 
- the Solid Waste Fund and the Airport Fund.</p> 
<p>The basic definition of an enterprise fund, according to Burchett, &quot;is 
an entity controlled the local government that derives its revenues from 
collections of external user fees.&quot;</p> 
<p>However, &quot;It is not necessary for the (entity) to receive all of its 
revenue from external user fees.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Solid Waste Fund total expense budget for 2005 is $650,179, 
representing an increase of roughly $227,000 over last year's budget, &quot;but 
only represents an increase of $27,308 from the fiscal year 2003 expenses.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Most of this year's Solid Waste Fund expenses, $358,470, are personnel 
costs, including items such as payroll taxes, insurance and workers 
compensation.</p> 
<p>Operating expenses for the Solid Waste Fund this year are budgeted at 
$156,213, with roughly 40 percent of that total aimed at covering the costs of 
operating and maintaining landfill and recycling center equipment.</p> 
<p>This year's Solid Waste Fund also includes budgeted amounts for capital 
equipment acquisitions; $77,596 is allocated for purchase and installation of 
scales, while $56,000 is tagged for purchase of &quot;a mobile office to serve 
as the gatehouse for the landfill.&quot;</p> 
<p>Though currently listed as expenses, says Burchett, &quot;These costs will 
be reflected as assets when the financial statement is presented for fiscal 
year 2005, as is the common practice of a business operation.&quot;</p> 
<p>With regard to the Airport Fund, total budgeted expenses for this year are 
$6,523,967, with $5.9 million of that amount budgeted for completion of airport 
improvements.</p> 
<p>Through its grants program, the Federal Aviation Administration funds 
nearly 90 percent of the total costs associated with such improvements, while 
the state provides nearly 5 percent in additional funding.</p> 
<p>The remaining funding is provided by the county and includes collection of 
airport user fees.</p> 
<p>On a related note, last year the Airport Fund also received additional 
financing in the form of a $2.5 million loan from Colorado State Infrastructure 
Bank at a 4-percent interest rate, to be repaid over a 10-year period.</p> 
<p>The first payment on this loan, $208,227 of principal plus $100,000 in 
interest, occurs this year.</p> 
<p>Other inclusions listed in this year's Airport Fund include $60,000 for 
third party snow-removal contracts, $50,000 for maintenance equipment and 
$2,500 for replacement computer systems.</p>

<p><b>Engineering firm picked for river restoration plan </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Restoration of the San Juan River - for fishing and boating - from Town 
Park to the Apache Street bridge is expected to begin with design work and 
maintenance over the next several months.</p> 
<p>Recreation Engineering and Planning (REP), of Boulder was chosen by a 
committee of town staff, property owners, river recreationalists and river 
enthusiasts from among five proposals to take on the estimated $40,000 design 
phase.</p> 
<p>Town manager Mark Garcia said one of the first tasks will be redesigning 
some of the existing river structures to prevent the &quot;beaching&quot; of 
innertubes during low-water flows and reduce safety hazards.</p> 
<p>The company will also work with the town on a proposed pedestrian bridge 
near the town park gazebo.</p> 
<p>Garcia said money for a pedestrian trail on North 8th Street from Florida 
Street to Cemetery Road had to be reallocated after engineering review 
determined the grade was too steep for the trail. An additional pedestrian 
bridge in town park was one suggestion outlined in a proposed downtown master 
plan, would connect the Town Park Riverwalk with the Reservoir Hill trails 
system and could provide a spectacular viewing point for watching river sports.
</p> 
<p>The entire restoration project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 
$400,000. Goals include: making the river channel's appearance more natural, 
adding put-in and take-out points for boaters, improving structure for fishing 
habitat from the pedestrian bridge to Apache Street and diverting enough water 
from Loch's Ditch to enhance the wetlands between 6th Street and Hot Springs 
Boulevard.</p> 
<p>The first phase of restoration, from JJ's Upstream Restaurant to the 
pedestrian bridge, a distance of about a mile and a half was completed in 1994. 
The focus was to improve quality of river habitat and increase recreational 
experience for handicapped persons. According to studies, the fish population 
and number of river users have increased.</p> 
<p>A third phase would include the stretch of river from Apache Street to the 
town boundary.</p> 
<p>Designers for the second phase, REP, have over 20 years of experience in 
whitewater park design, fish habitat improvement and river restoration. The 
company employs experts in site planning, park and trails planning, whitewater 
park planning and fish habitat and migration.</p> 
<p>Julie Jessen, town special projects director, said a three-phase approach 
will be used throughout the design process. Public meetings will integrate a 
broader vision for development and restoration.</p>

<p><b>County's 'big box' moratorium is extended </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County commissioners agreed Tuesday to extend a moratorium on 
superstore development through Aug. 1.</p> 
<p>An original resolution banning &quot;big-box&quot; stores, approved by the 
county last August, had been set to expire today.</p> 
<p>According to the resolution approved this week, an extension is necessary 
to allow time for further analysis of the potential impacts posed by big-box 
developments, as well as how to offset those impacts, if necessary.</p> 
<p>Specifically, the resolution directs the county department of community 
development &quot;to continue its study and evaluation and to recommend new 
land use regulations to address superstore development.&quot;</p> 
<p>The resolution also calls for cooperation &quot;with the staff of the town 
of Pagosa Springs to assist in the county's implementation, as necessary, of 
the proposed regulations.&quot;</p> 
<p>The town passed a similar measure Jan. 4, extending a prior ban on retail 
stores over 18,000 square feet and grocery stores over 55,000 square feet 
through May 27.</p> 
<p>With respect to the definition of superstores, they are described within 
the resolution as &quot;any building, or combination of buildings, intended to 
be used principally for the purpose of retail sales and marketing ... which 
exceed 18,000 square feet in size.&quot;</p> 
<p>The definition also applies to buildings featuring supplementary segments 
for retail food sales.</p> 
<p>However, &quot;Buildings used principally for the sale of retail food are 
excepted from the term 'superstore.'&quot;</p> 
<p>In a related move Tuesday, the board also directed county planning staff to 
advertise a request for qualifications aimed at identifying professional 
consultants who may be hired to assist with the ongoing creation of new county 
land use codes, including those related to superstore development.</p> 
<p>According to Claudia Smith, a member of the Big Box Task Force established 
last summer, economic research centering on superstore developments is expected 
to be complete by the end of March.</p> 
<p>A draft of the &quot;Big Box&quot; Task Force's summary of current findings 
is available for review at www.townofpagosasprings.com.</p> 
<p>In other business this week:</p> 
<p>- set a work session for discussion of &quot;critical roads&quot; 
maintenance for 9 a.m. tomorrow in the courthouse meeting room;</p> 
<p>- moved to reappoint Alicia O'Brien, Sabra Miller and Lisa Scott to the 
county fair board while appointing Danna Laverty, Jan Karn, Annette McInnis and 
Sally High to three-year terms on the board;</p> 
<p>- moved to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the Sixth 
Judicial District Attorney regarding operations and procurement support for the 
district attorney's office;</p> 
<p>- approved the 2005 Homeland Security Grant application;</p> 
<p>- denied a request to appeal a previous board decision denying refund of 
sidewalk escrow funds to Ridgeview Entertainment LLC;</p> 
<p>- approved the 2005 distribution of HUTF monies to metro districts;</p> 
<p>- pending legal review, approved a request from University of Colorado at 
Denver graduate student's request to place wind sensors on the Navajo Bridge 
for research purposes.</p>

<p><b>Nine firms reply to town's invitation for plan consultant </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Nine proposals from comprehensive planning consultants were received by the 
town's Jan. 31 deadline. Six came from Colorado, three from out-of-state, 
including one from New York.</p> 
<p>Special projects director Julie Jessen said a final selection should be 
made around the first week in March. Creating the comprehensive plan is 
expected to take about a year.</p> 
<p>The plan will address housing, economic development, health and safety, 
natural environment, public infrastructure, transportation, parks, recreation, 
trails and open space, community facilities, history of the community, and 
growth and development.</p> 
<p>Cost for the consultant will be in the range of $100,000-$150,000. Jessen 
said a committee of town staff, two town council members and two planning 
commission members will be formed to make the final selection.</p> 
<p>The Town of Pagosa Springs received just over $60,000 in an Energy and 
Mineral Impact Assistance matching grant to help fund the process.</p> 
<p>According to the town's home rule charter, adopted in the fall of 2003, the 
town is required to update its comprehensive plan every five years. The last 
plan, created in 1979, was never officially adopted.</p>

<p><b>County audit finally submitted to state </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Discovery of several accounts that had not been reconciled.</p> 
<p>A complete overhaul of the county finance department, including personnel 
and computer systems.</p> 
<p>And Governmental Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 34, or 
&quot;GASB 34&quot; - a new financial model for local governments requiring 
numerous changes in reporting procedure.</p> 
<p>According to Todd Beckstead, an accountant with the Grand Junction-based 
accounting firm of Chadwick, Steinkirchner, Davis &amp; Co. PC, all of the 
above factored into the delayed completion of the 2003 Archuleta County audit.
</p> 
<p>Despite the difficulties, &quot;Eventually, we got there; that's the bottom 
line,&quot; said Beckstead while presenting a brief recap of the 2003 audit 
during Tuesday's board of commissioners' meeting.</p> 
<p>As a result, it is now unlikely the county will face serious ramifications 
related to the delinquent submittal of the audit to the state auditor's office.
</p> 
<p>However, the possibility for numerous complications was very real a month 
ago.</p> 
<p>State statute requires submission of county audits or applications for a 
60-day extension by July 31.</p> 
<p>The county applied for and received an extension in late June, effectively 
bumping the audit due date to Sept. 30, but failed to meet that deadline.</p> 
<p>Further delay prompted an inquiry to the county from Dianne Ray, director 
of local government audits with the state auditor's office.</p> 
<p>In a certified letter dated Dec. 20, 2004, Ray cited previous letters 
notifying the county &quot;of its delinquent status,&quot; stating her office 
had &quot;not received a satisfactory response.&quot;</p> 
<p>Consequently, &quot;... I am authorizing you to hold all funds generated 
pursuant to the taxing authority of such local government in your 
possession,&quot; said Ray.</p> 
<p>&quot;Do not release these funds until you are notified in writing to do so 
by this office,&quot; she added.</p> 
<p>However, as Ray indicated in an early-January telephone interview with The 
SUN, the state was willing to grant a little leniency.</p> 
<p>&quot;As soon as they get it here, we'll release the funds and they're made 
whole, again,&quot; Ray concluded.</p> 
<p>And with any luck, the state has already received the audit - after 
Beckstead's presentation Tuesday, the board moved to accept the document and 
directed staff to forward it to the appropriate state agencies.</p> 
<p>Expressing her desire to expedite the process, &quot;Overnight it,&quot; 
concluded Mamie Lynch, board chair.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, Beckstead stated there were neither major discrepancies in 
the 2003 audit, nor any disagreements with management concerning audit findings.
</p> 
<p>Beckstead also indicated most of the problems encountered while preparing 
the 2003 audit can be minimized or avoided in the future.</p> 
<p>Responding to a question from Lynch regarding the status of the 2004 audit, 
&quot;If the records are in a satisfactory condition, then we will meet the 
deadline,&quot; said Beckstead.</p>

<p><b>Division of Wildlife sets hearings on wolf control plans </b> </p> 
<p>The Colorado Division of Wildlife will conduct a series of open house 
meetings around the state through mid-February to gather citizen input on the 
initial recommendations of the Colorado Wolf Management Working Group.</p> 
<p>The working group was convened early last year and given the primary task 
of recommending state guidelines for the management of gray wolves that migrate 
into Colorado. Members include livestock producers, wildlife advocates, 
sportsmen, local government officials and wildlife biologists. State and 
federal agency personnel are providing technical support to the group.</p> 
<p>&quot;The working group did an amazing job in reaching agreement on some of 
the basic issues of wolf management in Colorado,&quot; said Gary Skiba, 
multi-species coordinator for the department's wildlife conservation section.
</p> 
<p>Now that the working group has agreed on recommendations, a schedule to put 
policies in place will ensue over the next several months. First, the Colorado 
Wildlife Commission will review the group's recommendations.</p> 
<p>In March, DOW Director Bruce McCloskey will provide a draft of the state 
wildlife agency's recommendations on wolf management to the commission. The 
working group will review public comment and DOW recommendations in March or 
April. Finally, the commission will vote on final wolf migratory management 
policies in May.</p> 
<p>One gray wolf has been found in Colorado over the past year and more could 
migrate from states where the carnivores have been reintroduced.</p> 
<p>The DOW, wildlife commissioners, and state natural resource managers want 
to have a management plan in place in case more wolves enter the state. Wolves 
are listed under the federal Endangered Species Act, and Colorado will not have 
management authority until the wild canines are removed from federal protection.
</p> 
<p>Skiba said the state's first wolf management policy document would address 
migrating wolves only, and that the working group or a similar group might be 
convened in the future should Colorado need to consider more far-reaching 
wolf-management policies.</p> 
<p>&quot;We've taken some huge steps, and laid a strong foundation for 
management if wolves ever become established in Colorado,&quot; Skiba said.</p> 
<p>The DOW's open house meetings on the wolf working group's initial 
recommendations will take place 7-9 p.m., Jan. 31-Feb. 17. Exact dates and 
locations of meetings in this area are as follows:</p> 
<p>- Feb. 7 - Durango, Doubletree Hotel Durango, 501 Camino del Rio</p> 
<p>- Feb. 8 - Alamosa, Adams State College, Student Union Building, corner of 
First Street and Stadium Drive</p>

<p><b>Stollsteimer Creek Watershed study has been launched</b> </p> 
<p><b>By Cynthia Purcell</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The San Juan Conservation District is sponsoring an important watershed 
study in the Stollsteimer Creek Watershed area.</p> 
<p>This watershed encompasses approximately an 82,000-acre area from the lower 
portions of the Pagosa Peak area down to the confluence of Stollsteimer Creek 
and the Piedra River and includes portions of the town of Pagosa Springs, all 
of the Pagosa Lakes subdivisions, portions of the National Forest, Southern Ute 
Tribal lands, large portions of the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District 
and most of Aspen Springs.</p> 
<p>Everyone realizes the importance of water in our community, but to date 
nobody has really focused on a watershed study that looks at the whole picture. 
Our watershed study has an ultimate goal of creating a Master Watershed Plan 
document that would include a detailed study of the watershed, and 
recommendations and design plans to improve and protect the watershed.</p> 
<p>This is a multi-entity effort including the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service, the Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association , Pagosa Area Water and 
Sanitation District, the Town of Pagosa Springs, Archuleta County, the U.S. 
Forest Service, the Colorado State Forest Service and the Southern Ute Tribe.
</p> 
<p>The need for this plan has never been more critical than it is now. The 
population growth within the watershed has been extraordinary in the last 10 
years and is predicted to continue. With this growth many of the traditional 
uses of water in the watershed are being threatened.</p> 
<p>This is a long-term plan, with the intention of protecting the watershed 
well into the future. It is to ensure that we have clean water resources even 
after our community becomes much more urbanized over the next 20 years.</p> 
<p>We need citizen input in this study. If you live within this watershed area 
and haven't received a questionnaire in the mail, contact the San Juan 
Conservation District at 731-3615. We can mail, fax or e-mail the short survey 
to you. Please return it by Feb. 18 by mail or fax your reply to 731-1570.</p> 
<p>This planning effort needs to be driven by you, the local landowner, so 
that your concerns are identified and can be addressed. With your support, this 
study will help positively impact decisions made in the watershed for years to 
come. Once the surveys are tabulated we will be holding several landowner 
meetings to discuss the future plan.</p> 
<p>We look forward to hearing from you. Call the San Juan Conservation 
District with any questions or concerns at 731-3615.</p>

<p><b>State of denial</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Ms. Nina J. Adams' letter to the editor Jan. 27 illustrates why the 
Democratic Party is a party of losers. She whines and complains about the Bush 
Administration.</p> 
<p>Apparently she still cannot accept the fact the Democratic Party and its 
liberalism was rejected by the American people. It is unfortunate Ms. Adams 
still is living in a state of denial that the Democrats lost the election.</p> 
<p>There are good reasons the Democrats are having trouble winning elections. 
They have no definitive plan to offer the American people. John Kerry's daily 
vacillating was frightening to most Americans. They promote the same old failed 
programs. They always want more of our money. They support the immoral 
anomalous gay marriage platform. They encourage the immoral taking of the life 
of the unborn child. They favor activist judges that do not understand the 
constitution. They defend taking God out of the pledge of allegiance. They 
don't take terrorism seriously. They are weak in support of the military and 
they can not be trusted with our national security.</p> 
<p>All good reasons as to why the American people chose George Bush to lead 
our nation for four more years.</p> 
<p>The Howard Deans, the Barbara Boxers, the Michael Moores, the Ted Kennedys 
and the hate Bush crowd energized the American people to vote Republican. The 
people believed in President Bush's leadership. Liberalism was defeated.</p> 
<p>The election is over. Let's stop the carping and move forward.</p>

<p><b>USFS plan control</b> </p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The U.S. Forest Service (USFSR) and BLM are revising land management plans 
initiated in 1984. Community Study Group meetings will help determine issues 
such as recreation, vehicle use, transportation, mineral leasing, fuels 
management and more.</p> 
<p>Attending the first of these public meetings, on Thursday, Jan. 27, in the 
Pagosa Springs Junior High School library, was somewhat disappointing.</p> 
<p>The USFSR seems to have adopted a new method for managing public comment, 
to prevent it from &quot;getting out of hand.&quot; (We saw this at the last 
DEIS meeting on the proposed Village at Wolf Creek).</p> 
<p>By implementing a format where small groups meet at tables with 
facilitators (in this case who are not Forest Service or BLM employees - but 
hired facilitators who know how to &quot;manage&quot; people), the meeting 
takes on a docile form. Attendees are not able to build energy and become 
better informed by sharing their ideas and concerns as an entire group.</p> 
<p>Questions addressed seem to orchestrate getting the answers they seek:</p> 
<p>1. What activities would you consider appropriate to restore Ponderosa Pine 
and mixed conifer tree types back to more open and mature stand composition and 
where?</p> 
<p>2. Are the current needs of the recreation visitor being met and what 
changes are needed to prepare for recreation uses into the future?</p> 
<p>Oh yes, we are following the letter of the law, inviting public comment, 
and it &quot;appears&quot; to be well done, but for some strange reason I found 
it difficult to be a &quot;good little doobie&quot; and place my one sticker 
(out of 30 or more possibilities) on the map of the Williams Reservoir 
&quot;Landscape&quot; to denote its single most important use.</p> 
<p>Ah yes, the best laid plans of mice and men - I'm sure someone thought this 
was a great idea - our tax dollars at work. A turnout of 50 people or so 
demonstrated that the public does care and is taking an interest ... but I'm 
sorry ... at the most subtle level it felt like a meeting quietly arranged to 
meet the ends of a bureaucracy, rather than to truly assess the interests and 
needs of a community.</p> 
<p>I hear that this administration is moving toward privatization of land 
management. As the human footprint attempts to gobble up more of our public 
lands, I hope that more voices will come forth and speak to help preserve and 
protect what we hold dear. The Community Study Group will continue to meet on 
the last Thursday of each month through June, to offer input to changes in our 
region's land management program. Hopefully these meetings will evolve into a 
format that invites broader and deeper comment from those who live here and 
care about our National Forests and Wilderness &quot;Landscapes.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Addict's plea</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>A dealer's suggestion bargains for control, the words used to influence the 
actions of others. </p> 
<p>Addicted people suggest there is a remedy for control. Not even the law can 
protect your children, or perhaps yourselves, from some suggestions.</p> 
<p>Some playgrounds are man-made, out of quicksand, intentionally made, by 
those who are accustomed to being stuck in the mud; not generally participating 
by choice, but by disease.</p> 
<p>I'm suggesting that we all act as one parent, who has taken a parenting 
with love and logic class (please think of the principles within that program), 
and treat this county like a child with greater potential than just a scenic 
route.</p> 
<p>Don't use words like &quot;If they would...,&quot; or &quot;They are always 
...&quot;. We must say &quot;When we will ...&quot; and &quot;We always will 
...&quot;</p> 
<p>I hope this community develops a plan for a rehabilitation site for all our 
kids' sakes. I am an addict myself, and I never stop hearing what dealers and 
concerned citizens say: &quot;One hit and you'll never quit.&quot;</p> 
<p>It is that very suggestion that is the poison that keeps people coming back 
for more.</p> 
<p>That is what dealers want addicts to believe. The words are powerful but I 
am sure as a community we can overpower that expression with love and 
compassion. Words that will encourage those who are in trouble to get help.</p> 
<p>It is written that words can kill or they can give life. It is up to me to 
help myself but I will say what I feel is right to help you too. I worry about 
the kids in this county who fear for themselves and their parents. That they 
might be feeling hopeless at what is implied by people who are afraid of meth 
or addicts. Recovering addicts like me should have hope for redemption and 
forgiveness. That is why Jesus Christ gave his life.</p> 
<p>I hope we can let them know that nothing is impossible with God and that 
there are people who overcome drug addictions, including crystal meth. That is 
something I must believe so that I am not overcome with sorrow and end up 
defeating the purpose of loving and forgiving myself.</p> 
<p>It takes work and dedication to be a part of Narcotics Anonymous and other 
forms of therapy. Certain ideas could hurt what people in these organizations 
fight so hard to accomplish to help other people like them. The chemical 
changes that occur in the body are fierce.</p> 
<p>I would not imply that all souls who try drugs or develop addictions are 
lost forever. Those who do choose to walk that path will suffer hardships. That 
is not a subject to be argued.</p> 
<p>Let's talk about finding a place out here where our citizens can get help. 
We know this is a big problem, so let's research some solutions together. As a 
community we can find more resources for people to utilize to reduce the number 
of people who are infected with addiction.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The question of whether or not the United States is a Christian nation has 
been debated for many years and the letter posted in last week's section 
prompted me to respond.</p> 
<p>In the late 1800s the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to rule on 
the question and spent 10 years reviewing all of the available evidence. 
Finally, in 1892, they issued the &quot;Trinity Decision&quot; in which they 
unanimously stated that the United States is a Christian nation.</p>

<p><b>Back off</b> </p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Last time I checked we still live in America. Capitalism drives our 
economy. Don't hate David and Carol Brown because they have money.</p> 
<p>Liberals are always trying to cut down the tall poppies. David and Carol 
have been very generous to our community charities. They have employed tons of 
people at BootJack over the years not to mention all of the lumber, concrete, 
gravel and construction materials they buy locally. I myself was a carpenter at 
Dave's ranch and he pays higher than any other local builder. </p> 
<p>His projects are of the highest quality and if he did develop in town it 
would help this town tremendously. I too want to develop in town and I'm 
concerned that people don't want development and fight every project on the 
table.</p> 
<p>Construction and tourism drive Pagosa's economy. Growth should be 
controlled. The fact is 95 percent of our country is open space and wilderness 
with only 5 percent developed. Private property is just that, private. So stop 
the hating and the bashing and &quot;Love thy neighbor.&quot;</p> 
<p>America was built and forged by people like David and Carol. If you work 
hard anything is possible. The Browns give back to the community and protect 
areas up on the pass. America is a great country but the Brown bashers should 
look at the fact that Pagosa will change, is going to change and the Browns 
would do a great job in town and we are lucky to have them. </p>

<p>Your front page lead story in last week's SUN prompted a little gray matter 
recall falling back to the very early days of a 33-year U.S. Navy global 
adventure.</p> 
<p>An admiral once told me after I made some enormous blunder, &quot;Son, what 
should happen when you make a mistake is this: You take your knocks, your learn 
your lessons, and then you move on; that's the healthiest way possible to deal 
with a problem.&quot; Ya know, that surly old sea-dog was right on target. </p> 
<p>Time to saddle up yer best-liked nag and trot off into the &quot;Best of 
Colorado&quot; and check some cattle brands, Sheriff Tom Richards. Your mistake 
has cost the local taxpayer enough in more ways than one. It is the hour to do 
the right thing - abdicate - expeditiously. Make your legal appeal on your 
time. Do not drag it out on the citizens' clock any longer and make it messy. 
Retirement is fun; make the most of it.</p> 
<p>Now is the moment to hand over the reins to some younger blood to assume 
the stress of law enforcement in this rapidly growing community. I am supremely 
confident that there is working professional excellence out there somewhere - 
just waiting. They will do well. Which should be your fervent and paramount

<p><b>Jury jeopardy</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Judge Jim Denvir of Archuleta County Court needs to get his court in order.
</p> 
<p>On Monday, Jan. 24, over 40 citizens were summoned to appear in court for 
possible jury selection for a &quot;scheduled trial.&quot; These citizens were 
notified 30 days prior to trial date. They, as responsible citizens, appeared 
at or before 8:30 a.m., only to wait and stare at blank courthouse walls over 
an hour while judge and attorneys met to decide to go, or not to go, to trial.
</p> 
<p>Decision - no trial.</p> 
<p>What goes here? Attorneys not prepared? Pagosa citizens were. What is going 
on is a total lack of concern, disregard and indifference for the citizens who 
appeared as summoned.</p> 
<p>The impact on 40-plus citizens is significant, i.e., substitute teachers, 
baby-sitters, cancelled appointments, etc. If this court conduct continues 
citizens may develop apathy toward jury service and its importance.</p> 
<p>Citizens were expected to be ready to go at 8:30 a.m. - so should everyone 
else, involved, no exceptions.</p> 
<p>Another court insult to the same citizens is a memo handed out saying if 
you were not selected today, show up next week, 1/31/05 for a different trial. 
Reschedule your agenda again for another &quot;maybe&quot; trial?</p> 
<p>There is a total disregard for citizens willing to serve - apologies and 
platitudes for inconvenience do not wash.</p> 
<p>The indifference and disregard for citizens' time is appalling, and for 
those summoned, time is as valuable as the court's.</p> 
<p>Shoring up holes in the court system begins with you, Judge Denvir.</p>

finally corrected; yet, no amount of money can adequately compensate him for 
the damage done to his professional career and the harm done to his personal

<p>The finding of the jury in the federal civil rights case brought by Larry

manager.</p> 
<p>I am immensely proud of the support courageously shown by the PLPOA board 
of directors during the difficult political climate of late 1997 to July 1998. 
The fairness, professionalism and judgment of directors Don Costa, Lee Vorhies, 
Mojie Adler, Joe Apker, Vince DeBennedette and Bob Fiedler (since deceased) 
have also been vindicated by this verdict.</p> 
<p>In particular, I wish to note that the legal counsel received by the board

<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Are the rich getting richer and the poor, poorer? Do you care?</p> 
<p>Is there any difference between the rich man and the poor man besides the 
money? A few years ago I was looking into a nonprofit organization to help feed 
people in third world nations and I was looking at what the presidents of these 
organizations were making. Some were making over $400,000 a year and yet it 
took anywhere from $8 to $20 a month to feed a person. How can a nonprofit pay 
that much for there top guy and still do a great job? I don't think there heart 
is in it. I could see maybe $100,000 a year but not $400,000. It should no 
longer be a nonprofit if the top people are making over $100,000 a year.</p> 
<p>Is that sounding socialistic, or do we as human beings just lack 
self-control? Maybe it is both. I don't like that word &quot;socialistic,&quot; 
but what else can we do? </p> 
<p>Do we need some limits here? Why does it happen? Is it from greed, neglect, 
or ignorance? Maybe it is from all three. Maybe it is because the poor don't 
want to work? Do they just want a free handout? Maybe they are tired of trying 
to get ahead and just not finding a way to do it.</p> 
<p>Is this OK, or is it a bad thing? Does it cause harm to all Americans or 
just to the poor? If the poor were to be able to earn more with less effort 
would they just blow it or would they invest and save it? Would they start 
their own businesses? What can be done about it? Does anything need to be done 
about it? Do you care? If you are poor you probably do and if you are rich you 
probably do not.</p>

<p><b>Expunged quotes</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In defense of Mr. Sawicki and to enlighten his maligners, including the 
editor's sarcastic and unprofessional note (1-20), anent the church/state issue 
of our founding fathers, I offer the following quotes which have been expunged 
from textbooks by the liberal secular humanists who run our school system.</p> 
<p>Contrary to Mr. Pierce's mistaken assertions (1/27) that our founders did 
not believe in divine intervention and resoundingly believe in separation of 
church and state, I invite him and SUN readers to consider the evidence. </p> 
<p>Fifty-two of the 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence were 
orthodox, deeply committed Christians. The other three believed in the Bible as 
divine truth, the God of Scripture, and His personal intervention. After 
creating the Declaration, the Continental Congress voted to purchase and 
distribute 20,000 Bibles.</p> 
<p>Patrick Henry: &quot;An appeal to arms and the God of Hosts is all that is 
left to us.&quot; In 1776 he wrote: &quot;This great nation was founded by 
Christians on the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot;</p> 
<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote on the front of his well-worn Bible: &quot;I am a 
disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. Our whole country will soon be rallied to 
the unity of our creator and to the pure doctrine of Jesus.&quot;</p> 
<p>George Washington (farewell speech of 9/19/1796): &quot;It is impossible to 
govern the world without God and the Bible. Our religion and morality are the 
indispensable supporters. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that 
our national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.&quot; 
From his personal prayer book: &quot;Bless, O Lord, the whole of the race of 
mankind and let the world be filled with the knowledge of thy Son, Jesus 
Christ.&quot;</p> 
<p>John Adams (to military leaders): &quot;Our Constitution was made only for 
a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any 
other.&quot;</p> 
<p>James Madison (primary author of the Constitution): &quot;We have staked 
the whole future of our new nation not on the power of government but upon the 
capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the principles 
of the Ten Commandments.&quot;</p> 
<p>U.S. Congress in a 1782 resolution: &quot;The Congress of the United States 
recommends and approves the Holy Bible for use in all schools.&quot;</p> 
<p>John Jay (first Court Justice): &quot;When we select our national leaders, 
to preserve our nation, we must select Christians.&quot;</p> 
<p>John Quincy Adams (8/4/1821): &quot;The highest glory of the American 
Revolution was this: it connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of 
civil government with the principles of Christianity.&quot;</p> 
<p>William Holms McGuffey (dubbed by President Lincoln as the 
&quot;Schoolmaster of the Nation&quot;) whose Reader was used for over 100 
years with over 125 million copies sold: &quot;The Christian religion is the 
religion of our country. On its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our 
free institutions.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Music in the Mountains tickets are the perfect Valentine gift </b></p> 
<p><b>By Carole Howard</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>If you're looking for something special for your Valentine, Music in the 
Mountains suggests giving a gift certificate for one of this summer's classical 
music festival events. You have a choice of four concerts, each of which will 
bring world-class musicians to Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The first event will be an elegant benefit with a reception and concert 
hosted by David and Carol Brown at BootJack Ranch in their fabulous 
glass-roofed Aquatic Center 5-9 p.m. Saturday, June 25. Guests will enjoy 
sumptuous hors d'oeuvres on the outdoor patio, followed by an intimate piano 
recital.</p> 
<p>Attendance is limited to 125 guests. Cost is $175 per person. Funds raised 
will help support classical concerts as well as children's scholarships and 
musical events in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The evening's special performer will be Kirill Gliadkovsky, born in Moscow 
and the winner of numerous prestigious prizes. Since his public debut at the 
age of six, he has performed piano and organ recitals and been a soloist with 
orchestras in cities all over the world. As well, he has appeared on numerous 
radio and TV programs. He is an orchestra and choral conductor, and also 
composes for piano and organ.</p> 
<p>The benefit concert will open with a performance by one of our gifted local 
scholarship students. </p> 
<p>Three additional classical concerts will take place in July and August, 
also at BootJack Ranch:</p> 
<p>1. On Friday, July 22 Pagosa welcomes internationally famous violinist 
Vadim Gluzman, whose performance will include Bruch's &quot;Octet&quot; at 7 
p.m. Gluzman has been lauded by critics and audiences as one of the most 
inspiring, dynamic artists performing today. Cost of this concert is $40.</p> 
<p>2. Saturday, July 30, pianist Aviram Reichert will perform Beethoven's 
Piano concertos No. 3 and No. 5 at 6 p.m. with the full festival orchestra. 
Reichart, who has won numerous awards and performed with major orchestras in 
Israel and Europe, wowed Pagosa audiences when he played here the last two 
summers. This is the first time we will have the full festival orchestra 
playing in Pagosa, in a larger tent seating 350. Cost of this concert is $50. 
(Note the earlier starting time and Saturday date.)</p> 
<p>3. On Friday, Aug. 5, Antonio Pompa-Baldi brings his piano mastery back to 
Pagosa. Having performed with orchestras around the world and in the PBS 
&quot;Concerto&quot; series, he too was a great hit with local audiences the 
last two summers. His performance at 7 p.m. will include Shumann's &quot;Piano 
Quartet.&quot; Cost of this concert is $40.</p> 
<p>To make tickets to one of these events a gift for your Valentine, visit the 
Chamber of Commerce in downtown Pagosa Springs or call them at 264-2360 Pay by 
check or credit card (MasterCard or Visa) before Feb. 11 and arrangements will 
be made to get you an attractive gift certificate by Feb. 14.</p> 
<p>Chairman of the committee organizing these local festival events is Jan 
Clinkenbeard.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're incredibly lucky to have first-class musicians who have 
performed to rave reviews around the world come to Pagosa to play for us,&quot; 
Clinkenbeard said. &quot;Thanks to the Browns, we will enjoy this music in a 
spectacular mountain setting at the foot of Wolf Creek Pass.</p> 
<p>&quot;This summer we're especially pleased to host the full festival 
orchestra. This will be a special treat for everyone. Even with more than 50 
musicians, we promise to keep the same informal, intimate feeling that has made 
our concerts so special in the past.&quot;</p> 
<p>Clinkenbeard pointed out there has been a modest increase in the price of 
the tickets this year. Even with the boost, she said ticket prices pay for only 
a small portion of the cost of the concerts.</p> 
<p>&quot;That is why our benefit fund-raiser and the contributions we receive 
from individual donors, businesses and other larger organizations are so 
crucial to our Pagosa festival,&quot; she said. As well, all of the planning 
and organizational work is done by Clinkenbeard's local volunteer steering 
committee composed of Melinda Baum, Mary Jo Coulehan, Lauri Heraty, Carole 
Howard, Crystal Howe, Teresa Huft and Lisa Scott.</p> 
<p>With 2005 being the fourth year concerts have been held in Pagosa, 
community support is broadening and the performance of the full orchestra 
should involve new people in the local classical music scene.</p>

by friends to become a minister. He graduated from Starr King Seminary in 
Berkeley, Calif., and became a prominent Unitarian Universalist clergyman. In 
2001 he was elected as UUA president and is currently nominated for a second 
four-year term.</p> 
<p>The service and children's program will begin 10:30 a.m. in the Pagosah

<p><b>Pagosa actress, performer, teacher, wife off to NY stage </b></p> 
<p><b>By Erin K. Quirk</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>At a young age, we humans accept labels for ourselves that help the world 
identify us with ease. Whether they fit well or not, we all wear 
&quot;skins&quot; like doctor, runner, poet, overachiever, alcoholic, child, 
lover and healer.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs actress, performer, teacher, wife and mother Felicia Meyer 
left for New York Saturday to, through the medium of experimental theatre, 
radically examine the skins she wears and to ask a New York City audience the 
question:</p> 
<p>&quot;Who taught me to want what I want?&quot; </p> 
<p>Meyer along with a troupe of other professionals, students and alumni from 
Fort Lewis College are part of a production entitled &quot;Skins&quot; that 
will run for 10 days at the renowned Off-Broadway experimental theatre club La 
MaMa. The intent of the production is to challenge the audience to strip away 
skins others have sewn for them and find their authentic selves. </p> 
<p>The goal may sound lofty but the show, which is based on poetry, music and 
movement, feels organic and necessary.</p> 
<p>The performance is directed and choreographed by Kathryn Moller, professor 
of theatre and women's studies at Fort Lewis College, and is based on the 
poetry and sculpture of artist Elizabeth Ingraham.</p> 
<p>The genesis of Ingraham's work, Meyer said, came from a period in her life 
where, as an attorney, she began to question if the skins she wore were 
accurately representing her. Meyer said Ingraham began to pare down her life to 
expose only the essentials. A series of earthy and challenging poems and 
sculptures was the result.</p> 
<p>Working with Ingraham, Moller adapted the poetry into a 75-minute theatre 
presentation that moves and speaks with multi-cultural players and even in 
different languages. Ingraham's poems probe deeply into the origin of the 
ancients and the infinity of the cosmos. Her work feels like an elegy for 
vanished potential, feminine wisdom and the tenuous connection between human 
and earth. The opening line of one poem simply reads, &quot;Gravity is the 
memory of light.&quot;</p> 
<p>Meyer and the rest of her cast mates will rehearse for four to five weeks 
in New York before enjoying a 10-day run at LaMaMa.</p> 
<p>Meyer is the niece of television actress Angela Lansbury and a former TV 
actress herself. She also holds a master's degree in film directing and has 
worked in documentary filmmaking, with such groups as the Discovery Channel, 
A&amp;E and the History Channel.</p> 
<p>Her current work with &quot;Skins&quot; in particular and experimental 
theatre in general allows her the freedom to move her body, stretch her mind 
and express her instincts as a performer. In her words, it allows her to 
&quot;work from the shoulders down.&quot; </p> 
<p>Meyer studied acting and experimental theatre at New York University and 
lived in Los Angeles for many years. There she held small parts in &quot;Knotts 
Landing,&quot; &quot;30-Something&quot; and &quot;Murder She Wrote.&quot; And, 
though she is thankful for the experiences she had as a TV actress, she felt 
stifled.</p> 
<p>&quot;I wasn't feeling completely fulfilled, like I wasn't using all of 
myself.&quot;</p> 
<p>Meyer, in fact, tells a funny story about watching actress Donna Mills 
prepare for a close up on &quot;Knotts Landing.&quot; She watched as the 
actress pulled individual hairs into perfect position around her face and 
didn't move her head and neck until the scene was through.</p> 
<p>&quot;I remember looking around the table,&quot; she said. &quot;It looked 
like everyone had a stiff neck.&quot;</p> 
<p>The work she is doing now with &quot;Skins,&quot; she said throwing her 
arms wide and nearly coming out of her chair, also gives her the opportunity to 
collaborate with other performers - something she missed deeply working in 
television.</p> 
<p>Collaboration is a major part of &quot;Skins.&quot; During the nine-hour 
daily rehearsals, Moller would ask the performers, most of whom are dancers and 
actors, to consider water and express it with movement. Then Moller would take 
the most arresting interpretations from the nine-member ensemble and build them 
into the performance. Meyer said the result of all those creative minds 
focusing on an element like water was a forum for wild creativity and energy.
</p> 
<p>Meyer knew when she and her husband Brad moved from Los Angeles to Pagosa 
Springs that her life as an actress would change dramatically. One might assume 
that the performing arts stage is invisible in a town like Pagosa. Not true, 
Meyer says. In fact, Meyer has found a lot of talent and dedication by working 
with young people in acting seminars and her annual summer camps. She is also 
impressed by the number of people in Pagosa willing to support the performing 
arts.</p> 
<p>&quot;That's the beauty of this community,&quot; she said. &quot;In the big 
city you just don't get that kind of support and you get so jaded. Here, people 
who don't even have kids are going just to support kids.&quot;</p> 
<p>Along with her teaching, Meyer is also collaborating with other local 
artists and performers to build a performing arts center in Pagosa Springs. 
Friends of the Performing Arts or FOPA is meeting regularly to discuss plans 
for such a venture.</p> 
<p>Meyer, who is also mother to a 5-year-old son, William, calls the 
opportunity to perform in the current production &quot;a gift.&quot; It has 
helped her examine her wife, mother, actress and teacher skins and to strike a 
balance between them. Tears form when she speaks of being away from her family 
for six weeks, but the excitement performing for them when they visit is clear. 
</p> 
<p>&quot;It will be a journey to go to New York,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a 
metaphor for my life. I am out of my comfort zone and leaving my family. I 
really consider it a gift to dive into those questions &#138; who taught me to 
want what I want.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Our Savior Lutheran hosts 16 Korean Academy students </b></p> 
<p><b>By Rev. Richard Bolland</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b> </p> 
<p>Our Savior Lutheran School played host to 16 children from Namwon Shi, 
South Korea during the week of Jan. 10-14.</p> 
<p>The students from the &quot;Let's Go English Academy,&quot; studied 
American culture and used the week to immerse themselves in the English 
language.</p> 
<p>Daniel Fiedler, director of the Academy, accompanied the students from 
South Korea, touring sites in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada and California to 
round out the visitors' experience.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Shirley Fiedler, (Daniel's mother and a faculty member at Our Savior 
Lutheran School), organized afternoon classes with the Korean students together 
with the fifth- and sixth-graders of the Lutheran School.</p> 
<p>According to Mrs. Fiedler, &quot;It was a great opportunity for young 
people of different cultures to connect on a person-to-person level, and to get 
to know more about each others people and nation.&quot;</p> 
<p>It is hoped that more visits can be made between the two schools.</p>

<p><b>Friend's grandma had a quote for every occasion </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Snow days are good times to clean out stuff, be it in closets, files or 
anything else. What won't go in my file cabinet goes in plastic boxes. It was a 
few of these boxes I got into last snow day, and it was in these boxes I came 
across all the notes about Grandma Simpson. Grandma Simpson was my friend 
Helen's grandmother whom she was always quoting. For example, Grandma Simpson 
said this:</p> 
<p>&quot;Pretty in the cradle</p> 
<p>Homely at the table</p> 
<p>Homely in the cradle</p> 
<p>Pretty at the table.&quot;</p> 
<p>Her advice for caring for things was to &quot;wear it out, make it do or do 
without.&quot; Now Helen wryly added that Grandma totally ignored this message 
if she wanted to do something.</p> 
<p>My favorite quote was that when she was asked where she got her hats, she 
answered, &quot;We don't get our hats, we have our hats.&quot; The custom was 
that women changed the trim on their hats until they found a new one they liked.
</p> 
<p>A table grace Helen and her husband Mac said was one that had come down in 
her family and one that Helen and Mac continued to say even after their family 
was gone:</p> 
<p>&quot;Father in heaven softly we pray, we want to say thank you for every 
day.&quot;</p> 
<p>Helen would go with Grandma Simpson to a resort hotel in the White 
Mountains of New Hampshire. One time grandma paid the cook at the hotel for his 
pie crust recipe. She paid $50 for it. Many years later Helen's daughter sent 
the recipe to the Dear Abby column. The columnist had written about her 
favorite pecan pie; She printed the submitted recipe:</p> 
<p>2 cups flour</p> 
<p>2/3 cups lard</p> 
<p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p> 
<p>1 egg yolk</p> 
<p>1 teaspoon lemon juice</p> 
<p>Approx. 1/2 cup cold water</p> 
<p>Cut fine as cornmeal and stir in liquid. Combine the egg yolk and lemon 
juice. Brush crust with an egg white for protection from juice and a glaze for 
top.</p> 
<p>I never knew either of my grandmothers and I love to hear about those of 
others. A note here: I never made this pie crust. Twice I bought lard, but that 
was as far as it got. It's a lot easier to buy a prepared pie crust. But 
really, I was a sissy.</p> 
<p>Fun on the run</p> 
<p>Isn't it great to be a guy &#138; </p> 
<p>- Your last name stays put.</p> 
<p>- You don't give a hoot if someone notices your new haircut.</p> 
<p>- Wrinkles add character.</p> 
<p>- Wedding dress $2,000; tux rental $100.</p> 
<p>- New shoes don't cut, blister or mangle your feet.</p> 
<p>- Your pals can be trusted never to trap you with, &quot;So, notice 
anything different?&quot;</p> 
<p>- Phone conversations are over in 30 seconds flat.</p> 
<p>- A five-day vacation requires only one suitcase.</p> 
<p>- You can leave the motel bed unmade. </p> 
<p>- You get extra credit for the slightest act of thoughtfulness.</p> 
<p>- Your underwear is $10 for a three-pack.</p> 
<p>- Everything on your face stays its original color.</p> 
<p>- Three pairs of shoes are more than enough.</p> 
<p>- You can quietly watch a game with your buddy for hours without ever 
thinking: &quot;He must be mad at me.&quot; </p> 
<p>- You can drop by to see a friend without having to bring a little gift.</p>
<p>- If another guy shows up at the party in the same outfit, you might become 
lifelong friends.</p> 
<p>- You are not expected to know the names of more than five colors.</p> 
<p>- You are unable to see wrinkles in your clothes.</p> 
<p>- The same hairstyle lasts for years, maybe decades.</p> 
<p>- You don't have to shave below your neck.</p>

<p><b>Truth: salvation is by faith, through grace </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Bolland </b></p> 
<p><b>Our Savior Lutheran Church</b></p> 
<p>It is often said, in today's pluralistic culture, that all religions are 
basically the same and that we can learn from all of them. Sometimes the claim 
is also made that unless we understand all religions we cannot understand our 
own as fully as we might.</p> 
<p>I would suggest that while it is helpful to understand the tenets of all 
faiths, that different faiths also have different and conflicting beliefs.</p> 
<p>Fundamentally, it cannot be true to say that if conflicting beliefs exist 
both can be true. In order to come to that conclusion, it is necessary first to 
say that nothing is absolutely true! My well-worn Webster's New World 
Dictionary of the American Language, defines truth this way:</p> 
<p>&quot;1. The quality or state of being true; specif., a) orig., loyalty; 
trustworthiness b) sincerity; genuineness; honesty c) the quality of being in 
accordance with experience, facts, or reality; conformity with facts d) 
reality; actual existence e) agreement with a standard, rule, etc.; 
correctness; accuracy 2. that which is true; statement, etc. that accords with 
fact or reality 3. an established or verified fact, principle, etc&#138;&quot;
</p> 
<p>In other words, in order for something to actually, really be true, it must 
be true for all people of all times whether or not anyone believes it. To 
assume conflicting claims can both be true is to deny truth itself.</p> 
<p>It is this understanding of truth that sets Christianity apart as a unique 
religion in the world. Its claims are quite exclusive, not inclusive:</p> 
<p>- Either Jesus Christ is the virgin born, divine/human Son of God or He is 
not.</p> 
<p>- Either the suffering and death of our Lord is adequate payment for 
humanity's sins, or it is not.</p> 
<p>- Either Jesus is the sole remedy appointed for the redemption of the 
world, or He is not.</p> 
<p>- Either the Holy Scriptures are the true revelation of God to men, or they 
are not.</p> 
<p>To say that all religions teach the same things is foolish and untrue. 
Hinduism - along with its descendent, Buddhism - clearly teaches that life is 
nothing but suffering and that &quot;salvation&quot; is finally to become 
sufficiently enlightened to escape this repetitive suffering and cease to 
exist. This is accomplished by doing good works and having the right attitudes 
and so acquire &quot;good Karma,&quot; and to avoid doing bad things and bad 
thoughts thus avoiding &quot;bad Karma.&quot;</p> 
<p>Islam teaches that God is so holy and removed from man that he cannot be 
personally known and can only be appeased through the keeping of the five 
pillars of Islam which is a list of good works that must be accomplished by 
each and every Muslim if he is to avoid hell.</p> 
<p>Judaism teaches that it is through the keeping of God's law that redemption 
and forgiveness can be found. As with other religions, there exist factions 
from &quot;Ultra Orthodox&quot; to &quot;Reform Judaism,&quot; but all are 
based on good works as the end of the faith.</p> 
<p>Christianity, by contrast, abandons all hope of acquiring &quot;good 
Karma,&quot; doing enough good works, or thinking enough good thoughts. 
Christianity teaches that all men are conceived and born sinful and can never - 
no matter how hard one tries - do enough good things or think enough good 
thoughts to ever merit God's forgiveness for our sin. Rather, God's love and 
compassion are seen in that He sent His one and only Son into the world to 
assume human flesh, to keep the Law perfectly, and to suffer and die for the 
sins of all people.</p> 
<p>Therefore, Jesus the Christ of God, is our substitute for our failure to 
keep the Law, for our complete inability to obtain the forgiveness of sins, and 
is the One who overcame the curse of sin - which is death - by rising to life 
from Good Friday's tomb.</p> 
<p>Therefore, salvation and heaven are not gained by good works, but by faith 
(complete trust), in what our Lord Jesus Christ has done on our behalf. We 
completely depend on the good works (righteousness) of Christ. We completely 
depend on the sacrificial suffering and death of our Lord as full and complete 
payment for all our sins. Therefore, we rejoice because there is no longer any 
outstanding debt of sin which remains against us. We are forgiven completely!
</p> 
<p>This does not mean Christians do not do good works, but our motivation for 
doing them is entirely different from all other religions in the world. We do 
good works precisely because we are thankful to God for the redemption He has 
given us through faith in Christ Jesus. We are not attempting to curry favor 
with God by doing good things, rather Christ moves us and enables us to live a 
life pleasing in His sight so that His glory might be seen in our lives.</p> 
<p>This is salvation by faith, through grace as revealed in the Bible or the 
Holy Scripture. It is a faith that has its hope solely in the love and actions 
of God, and not in vain attempts by sinful humanity to &quot;Get right with 
God.&quot;</p> 
<p>Now, either Christianity is right in this faith or it is not. If it is 
right, then no amount of good works or good thoughts will ever be acceptable in 
the sight of God since He has already sacrificed His Son to accomplish the 
salvation of mankind. Indeed, any such humanly based act is an incredible 
insult to God attempting to render payment for that which has already been 
perfectly accomplished by Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>If one's hope is in human accomplishments and works, then those with such a 
hope will never know if they have done enough, become enlightened enough, or 
thought enough good things and will always be left in doubt and fear as a 
result. But in the Christian faith, it is not our perfection but Christ's on 
which we depend. It is not our Law-keeping, but Christ's on which we depend. It 
is not our efforts, but God's perfect efforts to redeem His people which is our 
sure and certain hope.</p> 
<p>So there is a very big difference between faiths, and not all of them can 
be true since they offer diametrically opposed solutions for man's problem with 
sin and evil.</p> 
<p>In the Bible there are no less than 224 references to truth. In the Gospel 
of John alone, 52 times the subject of the truth is brought up with almost all 
of them being Jesus saying: &quot;I tell you the truth &#138;&quot;</p> 
<p>Perhaps it is necessary to understand that when Christ speaks, He can only 
speak the truth, as when He says:</p> 
<p>&quot;To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, 'If you hold to my 
teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the 
truth will set you free.'&quot; (John 8:31-32)</p>

<p>We had a modest turnout for our January birthdays celebration. Seniors Inc. 
has graciously volunteered to cover some of our meals, so that whenever seniors 
come in on the last Friday of the month to celebrate their birthday for that 
month, they only have to pay $1 for their meal. If you are celebrating your 
birthday next month, be sure to come in the last Friday of the month to 
celebrate.</p> 
<p>We had a great turnout for Doug Purcell's talk about mountain lions Jan. 
19. It was interesting that Doug confessed he has not seen a mountain lion in 
the wild, but many of our seniors had. Doug had some good information and 
fabulous photos, so we hope to have him back again in the spring. Thanks, Doug.
</p> 
<p>Dee Butler was here Jan. 26 to present &quot;Hair and Skin Care.&quot; She 
had a full house for her presentation and it was quite interesting to see Joann 
Sager in a red wig.</p> 
<p>Bodil will be here Friday to talk about spiritual death and dying issues. 
She has had a lot of experience with this subject in her naturopathic practice 
and with her own near-death experience. Come hear her talk at 1 p.m.</p> 
<p>Check out the fourth annual AARP-Redfeather Snowshoe Festival at Devils' 
Thumb Ranch (two miles west of Fraser off U.S. 40). It's open to all ages and

or just watch; it sounds like a good time.</p> 
<p>We still have Silver Foxes Den sweatshirts for sale at the senior center.

part of the Den.</p> 
<p>Do you have some free time to donate to our homebound seniors? We need 
someone to fill our Tuesday out-of-town route to deliver a meal to our seniors 
who can't get out. Spend an hour or so a week to brighten up a senior's life. 
Come in to the center today and pick up your application.</p> 
<p>Do you want to play with little ones at the community center on Wednesday? 
&quot;Pagosa Brats&quot; are playing in the gym Wednesdays 10 a.m.-noon and 
could use some grandparents to hang out with them. Just sit and just enjoy 
their antics if you like, or interact - but feel free to come in and say hi on 
Wednesday mornings.</p> 
<p><b>Helpful program</b></p> 
<p>The AARP sponsored Tax-Aide program is returning again this year. This 
service is offered via IRS/AARP trained and certified volunteers who reside in 
Pagosa. Most of the counselors are returning this year.</p> 
<p>The program is free and confidential and is provided for low and moderate 
income people. There is no age restriction; but preference is given to seniors 
who request it.</p> 
<p>The service includes tax form preparation or review for federal, Colorado 
and, sometimes, New Mexico returns. E-filing is available. If someone has 
prepared their returns but has a question they may come in for assistance.</p> 
<p>The Application for the Colorado Property Tax, Rent, Heat Rebate Program 
will also be prepared when appropriate. Colorado residents for all of 2004 
(brief absences OK), who are over 65 or a qualifying widow(er) over 58, with 
income less than $11,000 single or $14,700 married, and who pay property taxes 
or rent and heat are usually eligible. If the 2003 application has not been 
filed we can assist with this year, too. A disabled person for all of 2004 may 
be eligible, regardless of age. If you are unaware of this program but think 
you might qualify please come in to ask us about it.</p> 
<p>People who only plan the Colorado Property Tax /Rent-Heat Rebate 
application should come in early, as there are four payments rather than one 
this year. Also, people who do not have statements from brokerage companies 
(1099B) but who have all their other statements should come in early as well.
</p> 
<p>The program is for individual income tax returns. No corporate returns will 
be completed. Individuals with income from wages, or 1099's, Social Security, 
pensions, interest, dividends and some stock sales are eligible. If there is 
rental property or farm income (past a 1099-G ) a paid professional taxpayer 
should be consulted. No Schedule C with inventory or depreciation.</p> 
<p>Appointments may be scheduled via the sign-in sheet in the cafeteria or on 
a space-available basis during the Thursday sessions, beginning at 9 a.m. today

<p></p> 
<p><b>Only two weeks left before Winterfest </b></p> 
<p><b>By Mary Jo Coulehan</b></p> 
<p><b>Sun Columnist</b></p> 
<p>It is now February and we are already ticking off the months for 2005. </p> 
<p>I made it through my first annual Chamber Board retreat. And you thought we 
just gave parties and planned fun events. The fun events are only a part of our 
job here at the Chamber; we do have the business portion of our job.</p> 
<p>We thank Mary and Bob Hart and Hart's Rocky Mountain Retreat for again 
hosting our retreat and for their wonderful hospitality. We were treated to 
lunch by Victoria's Parlor with sumptuous wraps, that wonderful asparagus soup 
and a tasty salad. Our strained minds were very grateful.</p> 
<p>I would like to thank the board of directors, old and new, for not kicking 
me out of the meeting and for having patience with my first attempt at a major 
informational session with them. I think the reason they did not kick me out 
was because my right hand, Morna Trowbridge, was so complete in her 
informational packets that we provide to the board. Morna spent weeks getting 
ready for this meeting, along with performing all her other duties. I could not 
have been so well prepared without her assistance.</p> 
<p>In the March newsletter, I will provide a year in review and plans for the 
upcoming year. We have lots of ideas, but we need the participation of our 
members to make these plans successful. Look for this data in March and read 
your newsletters.</p> 
<p><b>Executive board </b> </p> 
<p>Your executive directors for 2005 are Toby Karlquist, president; Jessie 
Formwalt, vice president; and new kid on the block Jody Cromwell, 
secretary-treasurer. I am happy to have such a strong group of individuals 
serving as the executive committee.</p> 
<p>Rounding out the board of directors are Angie Gayhart, Scott Asay, Tony 
Gilbert, Patti Renner, Don McKeehan and Judy James. What a great group of 
people to be associated with - people who have a great knack for having fun and 
who have great business heads on those shoulders. If you see them around town, 
congratulate them or commiserate with them.</p> 
<p><b>Membership advantages</b></p> 
<p>As a chamber member, you have the ability to reach 750 other members with 
an advertisement of your business in our quarterly newsletter. If you are new 
or are just interested in reminding people out there about your business, bring 
750 single page (can be front and back) sheets to the Chamber where, for $40, 
we will stuff the inserts into the newsletter. It is a great, inexpensive way 
to let people know about you and the services you provide to our community. 
Deadline for the newsletter inserts is Friday, Feb. 18. This benefit is getting 
more popular with businesses, so don't miss your chance.</p> 
<p>Another Chamber benefit is our reader board in front of the Visitor Center. 
There are only 10 slots available to display an ad for your business.</p> 
<p>This board is where we promote events and hang community flyers, and it is 
a great after-hours location for our visitors to receive information. If you 
are interested in &quot;renting&quot; an advertising slot for a year for $50, 
contact Doug Trowbridge or myself for more information. The size of the space 
is 8 1/2-by-11 inches. Let our visitors know about your business even if we are 
not here to sing your praises.</p> 
<p>And one more great advertising space is LaPlata County Airport near 
Durango. We have only four slots available for brochures. The cost of 
displaying your brochures at our reader board in the airport is $50 per month. 
If you are a seasonal business, you can certainly display your brochures at 
your peak time of the year. Help those coming to Pagosa who are waiting for 
their luggage plan their time here.</p> 
<p><b>Help please</b></p> 
<p>We have two pleas for help from chamber members. </p> 
<p>The first is from Seeds of Learning childcare center. They are in the 
process of raising funds to start building a new facility. The town has 
arranged for some land and now the building fund must start. The organization 
has applied for a grant from the Daniels Foundation for $50,000. The trick to 
receiving the grant is that they must first raise $50,000 locally.</p> 
<p>The matching funds will expire in March, so it is crunch time. Seeds has 
raised over $25,000 and they are in the push to raise the final funds. If you 
are looking for a tax credit to cover you for 2004 or 2005, or even if you 
don't need a tax credit, consider giving to this organization. You may research 
the FYI Income 35 Colorado Child Care Tax Credit or give Lynne Bridges a call 
at 264-5513.</p> 
<p>By building this new facility, along with more than doubling the 
enrollment, the organization can qualify for national accreditation by the 
National Association of Educating Young Children, a huge asset for Archuleta 
County. Please help this group help our children.</p> 
<p>The second request is from the American Red Cross SW Colorado Chapter. I 
just attended an all-day session for American Red Cross disaster training. It 
was hugely informative and we are trying to start a small offshoot chapter here 
in Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>With wildfires, house fires and storms always a threat, we need to create 
our own disaster team here in Pagosa. Currently, should there be an emergency, 
someone is dispatched from La Plata County. There are the beginnings of a good 
core group of team advisors, but we need more disaster team members.</p> 
<p>Therefore, if anyone is interested in participating in or finding out more 
information about the American Red Cross Disaster Team, contact either Edie 
Corwin at 264-0496 or me here at the Chamber. There is not a lot of time 
involved, but the service you provide is invaluable.</p> 
<p><b>Winterfest</b></p> 
<p>Only two weeks and Winterfest will be upon us with lots of fun activities. 
</p> 
<p>Of course the highlight of the weekend will be the Balloon Rally taking 
place Saturday and Sunday mornings, Feb. 12 and 13, at approximately 8 a.m. The 
balloons will launch from a site near the Pagosa Lakes Recreation Center. 
Balloon sponsorships are still available. There is a range of sponsorships, all 
helping to support the Reach for the Peaks organization run by Liz Marchand. 
With this being the 20th year for the rally, we really would like to see a 
spectacular event.</p> 
<p>Right now, Liz is projecting close to 50 balloons. This number is important 
because there will also be a balloon glow Saturday evening starting around 
5:30-6 p.m. weather permitting. With this many balloons, the glow should be one 
of the best we have had. Give Liz Marchand a call at 731-3391 for more 
information.</p> 
<p>Also on Saturday, Feb. 12, is the snow sculpting contest here at the 
Visitor Center starting 10 a.m. with judging at 3 p.m. You can pick up an entry 
form here or we can fax you one. The entry fee will be $20 in advance and $25 
the day of the event. There will be a guarantee of $100 cash prize each for the 
Best Individual and Best Group entries. However, we will take the entry pot and 
split that up as well, so the more entries, the bigger the cash awards.</p> 
<p>This is a great event for a school, youth group, church or civic 
organization as well as for the talented individual. We have had some 
spectacular entries in the past and this is a great location for people to see 
your creations. Give us a call or come by to get an entry form. Only one small 
detail needs to be noted for this event: No power tools for you sculptors.</p> 
<p>On Sunday, after the balloon rally, everyone needs to head on over to High 
Country Lodge on U.S. 160 East for the Almost Anything Goes Downhill Sled Race. 
As our hosts again this year, Dick and Kathy Fitz have garnered some prizes to 
give out in addition to our usual cash prize of $50 to the fastest and most 
creative sleds. We will also award a $100 gift certificate to Montezuma's 
Restaurant and a $50 savings bond from Citizen's Bank.</p> 
<p>Entry fee for this event is $15 in advance and $25 the day of the race. 
Race time is noon and you need to have your sled checked out prior to that time.
</p> 
<p>Remember, your sled needs to be homemade and have brakes - no store-bought 
sleds or tubes. There will be lots of hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks 
available to the sledders and viewing gallery alike at no charge. What a great 
family event. We have had shower stalls and ironing boards for sleds in the 
past! So put on your creative wool cap and give Doug a call to get your entry 
form.</p> 
<p>And finally, when you recover from the sled race, go out for more laughter 
and watch some high-flying slam dunks and dazzling ball-handling with the 
fabulous Harlem Ambassadors basketball team as they play a local team. Tickets 
are only $6 for seniors and students and $8 for adults in advance. Children 
under 5 get in free. Ticket prices go up $2 if you get them at the door the 
evening of the event. This is a must see hilarious family comedy starting at 5 
p.m. at the high school gym</p> 
<p>Winterfest weekend happens right before Valentine's Day. So make it a 
special weekend for you, your family, or that special person in your life by 
getting out, having some fun, and enjoying some of the events we have here in 
Pagosa. If you haven't been to a balloon glow or sled race before, or seen the 
Harlem Ambassadors, shame on you! Get out, laugh a little and enjoy some of the 
times that make Pagosa a great place to live. </p> 
<p>OK, enough lecturing, here are some more great times and information for 
you to plan your life by.</p> 
<p>Wolf Creek will host Local Appreciation Day Sunday, Feb. 6, with lift 
tickets $22 and no ID required. While there, you can also enter the Super Bowl 
Race, 11 a.m.-1 p.m. You will even have time to ski and then make it home to 
watch the game.</p> 
<p>Tuesday, Feb. 8, will feature the Red Shoes Piano Trio returning to 
entertain Pagosans with a selection of classical music. This concert benefits 
the Silver Foxes Den Senior Center and the Fort Lewis Scholarship Fund. Tickets 
are $12 for the general public and $10 for seniors with a Silver Foxes Den 
membership card and children 12 and under. The concert will be held at the 
Restoration Fellowship Hall at 264 Village Dr., behind the Village Center City 
Market. Tickets may be obtained at the Chamber, the Senior Center or at the 
Plaid Pony.</p> 
<p>This hobby has really gone gangbusters: Scrapbooking. </p> 
<p>So to get you started, the Mountain View Homemakers are offering 
Scrapbooking 101 on Thursday, Feb. 10 starting at noon at Joann Guckert's 
house. For more information on the class and what you may need to bring, like 
some potluck food, contact Joann at 264-4820 or Robin Reedy at 731-4873.</p> 
<p>So are you tired yet? Once again, do not say that there is nothing to do in 
Pagosa! At least don't say that to me because I can always find you something 
to do.</p> 
<p><b>New members</b></p> 
<p>Oh I love this part of my job! I get to see what great businesses we have 
here in our community. So joining us this week is a whole slew of great people.
</p> 
<p>First off we have Crystal Coughlin with SAFER Living, LLC. SAFER Living 
(Senior Assistance For Everyday Respite) provides homecare services to senior 
citizens within the comfort and security of their own homes. Services offered 
are anything from homemaking chores (cleaning, running errands, meal 
preparation) to outdoor work, to handyman services, to personal care, to 
in-home assessments where they help coordinate care with health professionals. 
Help is available 24/7. Give them a call at 731-0821 for more information on 
this great service to our area.</p> 
<p>Also joining us is Charley Sage and Trophy Classics Taxidermy. With over 12 
years experience as a taxidermist, Charley produces high quality, detailed and 
lifelike mounts of elk, deer, bear, mountain lion, fish, birds and exotics. He 
also has a local showroom where you can view his work. With hunting and fishing 
being such a large industry in this area, you need to give Trophy Classics a 
call, especially if you outfitters need to accommodate your clients during 
hunting season so they can show off their conquests. Charley can be reached at 
946-0700.</p> 
<p>Also on board this week as a new member is Comfort One Insulation with 
Sabra Miller at the helm. Comfort One Insulation provides cellulose insulation. 
It is excellent fire protection and sound insulation. With all the building 
going on, you should check out this new provider of quality insulation at 
731-0153. Keep it local with quality service from Sabra Miller.</p> 
<p>OK, another first this week is 17 renewals. We welcome the following as 
they renew their memberships with us: Best Value/High Country Lodge, Coin 
Crafters and Engravers, Short Civil Engineering and Land Surveying, High 
Meadows Mortgage, Robin Auld, Best Western Oak Ridge Lodge and Squirrel's Pub 
and Pantry, Domo's Portable Toilets, JGS (associate member), Harms 
Photo/Graphic Associates, Harms PhotoGraphic and SelecPro School of 
Photography, Rick Unger, Kroger Corporation, Kerry Dermody, Foxfire 
Construction and, last but certainly not least, John and Char Neill who rejoin 
as associate members.</p> 
<p>Enough said. Just remember to mark your calendars with all the upcoming 
events and look around town for the schedule of events for Winterfest. I also 
hope that you will be able to give a little or a lot to the Seeds of Learning 
campaign. </p> 
<p>Every dollar counts for this first step to a bigger and better facility for 
children.</p> 
<p>We could still use some more snow for Winterfest, so get out there and do 
that snow dance thing. See you around town!</p>

<p></p> <b>Veteran's Corner</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Non-service connected VA pension plans explained </b></p> 
<p><b>Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Comumnist</b></p> 
<p>Non-Service Connected Disability Pension is a VA benefit program that 
provides financial support to wartime veterans having limited income.</p> 
<p>The amount payable under this program depends on the type and amount of 
income the veteran and family members receive from other sources.</p> 
<p><b>Countable income</b></p> 
<p>Monthly payments are made to bring a veteran's total annual income 
(including other retirement and Social Security income) to an established 
support level. (Unreimbursed medical expenses may reduce countable income.)</p> 
<p>Let me say right off no one is going to get rich on this VA pension 
benefit. For 2005 the pension amount for a single veteran is $10,162. For a 
married veteran the pension is $13,309. For each child, add $1,734.</p> 
<p><b>Aid and attendance</b></p> 
<p>For a veteran requiring aid and attendance the amount is $16,955. Married 
veteran A and A pension is $20,099. Veteran housebound is $12,419 and married, 
$15,566. Amount for each child is the same as above, $1,734.</p> 
<p>Remember, these are the maximum amount of allowable gross incomes as 
outlined above.</p> 
<p><b>Wartime service</b></p> 
<p>A veteran applying for a pension must be a wartime veteran. That is, he 
must have served in the military during a wartime period as defined by the VA. 
Generally speaking this of course includes the current conflicts as well as the 
first Gulf War, Vietnam, Korea, World War II and so on.</p> 
<p>Generally the veteran must have 90 days or more of service, of which at 
least one day must have occurred during a period of war, and the veteran must 
have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.</p> 
<p><b>Permanent disability</b></p> 
<p>Additionally, the veteran must have a disability that VA evaluates as 
permanent and total. I won't go into exact detail on all of these parameters, 
but obviously if you're a robust, healthy, working age veteran temporarily out 
of a job, you probably won't qualify for this benefit.</p> 
<p><b>Share-A-Ride</b></p> 
<p>Don't forget to call or stop by my office with your VA health care 
appointments for the &quot;Share-A-Ride program. Help a fellow veteran who may 
be going in the same direction to the same VA facility. Give me a call if you 
can provide transportation or need transportation. I will keep a calendar of 
who is going where to coordinate this important program.</p> 
<p><b>Durango VA Clinic</b></p> 
<p>The Durango VA Outpatient Clinic is at 400 S. Camino Del Rio, Suite G, 
Durango, Colorado 81301. Phone number is 247-2214. Albuquerque VAMC phone 
number is (800) 465-8262.</p> 
<p><b>Further information</b></p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans' benefits please call or stop 
by the Veterans Service Office on the lower floor of the county courthouse. The 
office number is 264-8375, fax 264-8376, e-mail afautheree@archuletacounty.org. 
The office is open from 8 a.m.-4 p.m., Monday through Thursday, Friday by 
appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 (discharge) for registration with the 
county, application for VA programs, and for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p></p> <b>Library News</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Interim director duties being shared </b></p> 
<p><b>By Barb Draper</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Since Lenore's retirement there have been a number of library staffing 
questions. There is an interim plan in place that is working well. Shirley 
Iverson and Peggy Bergon are sharing interim director duties while the rest of 
the staff continues with other daily/ongoing responsibilities.</p> 
<p>The library board of directors will be addressing the issue of a new 
director. There are many points to consider when hiring a person to adequately 
step in and fill Lenore's shoes, and this is a decision that is not to be made 
in haste. </p> 
<p><b>February displays</b> </p> 
<p>Have you read any good romance books lately? Read a biography about a great 
lover, singer or romantici? Looking for ideas for handmade Valentines and 
treats? Do you know the history of Valentine's Day? Books on all these topics 
and more can be found in one of our display cases, and all of these materials 
are available for checkout.</p> 
<p>February is also Black History Month. Biographies, civil rights background 
books and other information about Black America are located in the other 
display case. Most of these can be checked out as well. I say most, because 
there are a couple of private collection cookbooks there that are not ours to 
catalog for circulation. You may, however, copy a recipe or two from these 
books. There are some really interesting recipes in these books. Also, enjoy 
the dolls that are on display as a part of this presentation.</p> 
<p><b>Remember reception</b> </p> 
<p>Keep in mind that we are celebrating with Lenore and Gil Sunday, Feb. 27, 
from 2-4 p.m. in the Commons Area of the high school. Watch for the display ad 
about this in weeks to come.</p> 
<p><b>Tsunami relief</b></p> 
<p>Thank you for supporting this relief program with us last week. We are 
proud to present a check to the American Red Cross in the amount of $175 as a 
result of the fines money and other donations collected from you.</p> 
<p><b>Book donations</b></p> 
<p>We were glad to receive donations during the past week that will enhance 
our collection from John Mathis, Ann Pongrantz, Alice Kelley, Judy Lynch, John 
and Sandy Applegate, Jennifer Hedrick, Judy Horky, Ethel Rasnic, Jerry 
Archuleta and family, and Paul Matlock. We also appreciate the donation of a 
number of wonderful materials that will go into our collection, from a donor 
who wishes to remain anonymous.</p>

<p><b>Photo club meeting</b> </p> 
<p>The Pagosa Photo Club will meet 5:30 p.m. Feb. 9 at the community center 
with Jim Baumgardt of Durango discussing &quot;Photography after Dark.&quot;</p>
<p>Subjects discussed will include star trail photography, painting with 
light, equipment, etc. The listener will hopefully leave with a greater 
understanding of night photography.</p> 
<p>The talk is aimed at photographers at all skill levels and is appropriate 
for both film and digital equipment.</p> 
<p>Baumgardt has been a nature and landscape photographer for over 30 years. 
His fine art photography can be viewed at the Image Counts Gallery and Frame 
Shop where it illustrates his continuing love affair with nature, nurtured by 
the variety of moods and emotions that are expressed in her handiwork</p> 
<p><b>Digital photo seminars</b></p> 
<p>Bruce Andersen will lead a two-part seminar in digital photography called 
Digital Basics.</p> 
<p>This often-requested class will be taught 7 p.m. Tuesdays, Feb. 15 and 22 
in the community center.</p> 
<p>&quot;This is a very basic workshop,&quot; says Andersen. &quot;It is 
designed for the person who wants to learn how to use their new digital camera 
and the photo options on a computer as well as those who want to improve their 
digital photo skills. New camera owners and recent converts from film cameras 
will benefit equally from the classes.&quot;</p> 
<p>On Feb. 15, the focus will be on the camera, learning how to run the thing 
and how to make good choices with the various settings. Andersen will also 
cover composition and lighting issues as well.</p> 
<p>Then, on Feb. 22, he'll turn the class' attention to the computer and what 
to do with the image files once they're in the camera. Topics will include 
downloading, working the image file to liven up the photo, and preparing the 
photos for screen viewing and printing.</p> 
<p>Cost is $25 for each class or $40 for both sessions. Contact Bruce at 
baphoto@centurytel.net or call 731-4645 for more information or to reserve your 
spot. Space is limited.</p> 
<p><b>Slade workshops </b> </p> 
<p>The first of Betty's workshops is set for March 9-11, 9 a.m.-3 p.m. It is 
an intermediate watercolor workshop with the theme &quot;Seasons in 
Poetry.&quot; Cost is $120 for PSAC members, $125 nonmembers. Minimum six 
students; maximum 15.</p> 
<p>Join the class and be surprised how colors or a simple line will define a 
subject. In order to paint loosely and control the paints and water on paper, 
an artist must know the rules, then he or she is free to break them.</p> 
<p>Students will complete two paintings a day. First day - a winter landscape 
and winter still life; second day - fall landscape and harvest still life; 
third day - spring/summer flowers and summer still life.</p> 
<p>Betty Slade has four workshops scheduled this spring. Slade is an artist in 
the true sense. She began working in oils in 1965, then pursued watercolors, 
acrylic and pastels.</p> 
<p>Beginning with art classes at New Mexico State University, Betty continued 
with private instruction with some of the finest artists in the Southwest. 
After 40 years in the art arena, Betty has attained success in many areas of 
the arts. She has written and published several books, note cards and prints. 
She has 10 years experience in owning and managing art galleries. Currently she 
manages her own publishing company, The Hi Slade Publishing Company.</p> 
<p>A 30-minute television daily program, &quot;The Colors of His Heart,&quot; 
was designed to teach the word of God through Betty's art. It shows her love 
for the Bible and the arts. Her southwest &quot;Women of the Wind&quot; series 
in originals and prints is well known, is seen on the Princess Cruise Line and 
hangs in many private collections.</p> 
<p>Betty and her husband Al run the Blanco Dove Center for artists and 
writers. Anyone interested in seeing Betty's work or staying at the Blanco Dove 
may contact her at bslade2@pagosa.net. Betty desires to share her knowledge and 
stir the artist heart in others. Whoever enters her personal world will have 
their creative awareness heightened and will be gently encouraged to exercise 
the gift that lies deep within their soul.</p> 
<p>Contact PSAC at 264-5020 to sign up for her workshops. Dates, times and 
fees are listed below in the calendar section.</p> 
<p><b>Peer assistance network</b></p> 
<p>The Colorado Council on the Arts has relaunched the Peer Assistance Network 
(PAN) and Maryo Ewell is helping to administer the program.</p> 
<p>A PAN consultation enables organizations to obtain low-cost assistance on a 
host of issues from planning and board development to considering a facility. 
They have a network of advisors around the state, seasoned arts managers 
representing a great breadth of expertise. Maryo will work with groups to 
identify the advisor best suited to come to their community and work with their 
board or staff.</p> 
<p>They have funds for eight more sessions before June 30. If your 
organization is interested, please act soon.</p>

<p><b>Uncovering fat</b></p> 
<p>As the prevalence of obesity in America approaches epidemic proportions, 
researchers are scrambling to learn more about how the body stores fat, how fat 
tissues affect body systems and the role body fat plays in determining one's 
risk of chronic diseases. What researchers have learned is that fat is much 
more than an extra layer of insulation. It actually works as an endocrine organ 
that secretes dozens of proteins that affect the inner workings of the body.</p>
<p>One such protein is leptin. Discovered in 1994, leptin is released by fat 
cells. One of its functions is to send signals to the brain to boost or curb 
appetite. As a person gains weight, their fat cells release more leptin, which 
in theory should cause a decrease in appetite and an increase in the number of 
calories burned. However, researchers have found that obese people often are 
not sensitive to leptin; thus, it has little effect on their appetite and 
calorie usage. What's more, leptin may work against people trying to lose 
weight because, as a person loses weight, the body tends to release less 
leptin, potentially contributing to a boost in appetite and reduction in the 
number of calories burned at a given activity level.</p> 
<p>Another key protein secreted by fat cells is adiponectin. Adiponectin helps 
insulin move sugar from the bloodstream into the body's cells where it can be 
used either for fuel or stored. People who are overweight, and especially those 
who are insulin resistant, have low levels of adiponectin, which may raise the 
risk for diabetes and heart disease.</p> 
<p>Larger fat cells also cause the release of a variety of inflammatory 
proteins that result in low-level inflammation throughout the body. While the 
inflammation does not cause symptoms such as fever or pain, it can reduce the 
ability of insulin to move glucose out of the blood, thus leading to the 
development of plaque in the arteries and increased risk for heart attack or 
stroke.</p> 
<p>In addition to their biochemical influences, the location of fat cells 
seems to be important. People who gain weight around the middle (so-called 
apples) have been shown to be at higher risk for heart disease and diabetes 
than those who gain their weight in their hips and thighs (so-called pear 
shapes). Men are more likely to be apple-shaped, and women pear-shaped, at 
least in their younger years. Older women become more apple shaped as their 
weight shifts following menopause. Fat stored under the skin (subcutaneous fat) 
seems to have less influence on the development of chronic diseases than fat 
stored deep in the abdomen or near the heart and liver.</p> 
<p>While scientists have learned much about fat over the last decade, there is 
still more research to be done. Discovering that fat cells are capable of 
sending signals to the body and learning how the body stores fat are just the 
tip of the iceberg. Researchers now are working to determine how diet, exercise 
and other changes within the body affect the storage and regulation of fat 
tissue. In so doing, researchers hope to uncover more effective ways to treat 
obesity.</p>

<p>Weight loss is big industry here in our country. Before you can even get 
the details of the latest diet internalized, there's another new one on the 
market. Is weight loss a conundrum?</p> 
<p>Hardly the case. To lose weight, one takes in less calories than they burn 
and in most cases this strategy works.</p> 
<p>The latest acronym in the fat-study industry is NEAT which translates into 
non-exercise thermogenesis. The term refers to the calories people burn during 
everyday activities such as walking, fidgeting or even just standing.</p> 
<p>A recent study at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minn., 
found that obese people with sedentary life-styles appear to have a genetic 
inclination to sit around a lot.</p> 
<p>So couch potatoes aren't necessarily intentionally lazy. Blame it on low 
NEAT.</p> 
<p>With determination, perseverance and a realistic goal, weight loss is a 
doable undertaking. Unlike running a marathon, NEAT is within the reach of 
everyone because the kind of activity that is espoused does not require special 
or large spaces, unusual training regimens or gear.</p> 
<p>Would you like to lose a few pounds and at the same time lend a helping 
hand to Seeds of Learning Family Center - Archuleta County's only non-profit 
child care center? Here's how.</p> 
<p>Commit yourself to a goal to lose those unwanted pounds in six weeks. 
Challenge your friends and family to test your will power by pledging a per 
pound amount. The commitment will start Feb. 15 (yes, you can have your lavish 
Valentine's Day dinner) and will end March 29. Initial weigh-in will be Feb. 15 
followed by a weekly weigh-in, all at the recreation center. The final weigh-in 
will be March 29. A 32-use punch pass will be awarded to the person who has 
lost the most pounds. A 20-use punch pass and a 12-use punch pass will go to 
the second- and third-place person, respectively.</p> 
<p>Every dollar raised in &quot;Slim for Seeds&quot; will be donated to Seeds 
of Learning Family Center to help them build a much-needed new facility. I urge 
you not to miss this chance to help yourself and a worthy community project.</p>
<p>This event is sponsored by the Pagosa Lakes Recreation Center. Please call 
or come by to pick up your event packet. Your contribution to Seeds of Learning 
is deductible on your federal tax return to the full extent of the law.</p> 
<p>As inspiring as some of the weight loss programs are and as knowledgeable 
about the issue as you can be, all that won't make you healthier. The best we 
hope to do with &quot;Slim for Seeds&quot; is to give you a kick in the pants.
</p> 
<p>The racquetball courts in the recreation center will be closed for 
refinishing Saturday, Feb. 5, through Thursday, Feb. 10. Pending smooth 
execution of the job and cooperation from the sealant in curing, the courts 
will be ready for use Feb. 11. Racquetball, wally-ball and basketball players - 
please be patient and use this down time to do something else.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association will be sponsoring a second 
Winter Perch Tournament Saturday, Feb. 12, on Lake Pagosa. If you were one of 
the 115 anglers who participated in the first tournament last month, you 
already know how much fun you had. If you missed it, try to come out for this 
second tournament.</p> 
<p>Tournament tickets are $5 pre-purchase and $7 on tournament day. Kids 16 
and under are free and will compete separately for very nice ice fishing 
related prizes. There was $600 in prize money for the adult categories in the 
first tournament. Fishing may actually be a profitable hobby.</p> 
<p>Tickets are available at Ponderosa Do-It-Best, Pagosa Springs Area Chamber 
of Commerce, Pagosa Lakes Recreation Center and the PLPOA administrative office.
</p> 
<p>This event will be combined with other activities going on in conjunction 
with Winter Fest. The tournament will run 9:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m. You can call the 
PLPOA administrative offices at 731-5635 for more details.</p>

<p><b>Pirates bury Bayfield 62-32, go to Ignacio Friday </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Saturday night's Intermountain League contest pitting Pagosa Springs 
against visiting Bayfield was all about balance.</p> 
<p>The Pirates had plenty, getting double-figure scoring efforts from Jordan 
Shaffer, Caleb Forrest, Craig Schutz and Casey Schutz.</p> 
<p>The Wolverines had little, and despite getting a solid outing and 14 points 
from junior Troy McCoy, eventually fell to the home team by a final margin of 
62-32. </p> 
<p>However, the Wolverines played Pagosa evenly early on, slowing the pace and 
taking a 4-2 mid-quarter lead on a drive by C.J. Bell after early baskets by 
Pagosa's Casey Schutz and Bayfield's Kyle Guilliams.</p> 
<p>Pirate junior Paul Przybylski hit Craig Schutz in stride on the break to 
tie, and the Wolverines saw their last lead of the game at 5-4 after Lee 
Ramsier hit one of two at the line.</p> 
<p>Shaffer put Pagosa on top for good with a put-back, then Casey Schutz hit a 
pull-up jumper which McCoy matched with two in the paint and the Pirates led 
8-7 with 25 seconds left in the period.</p> 
<p>Craig Schutz buried a late trey to make it 11-7 after one quarter of play, 
then Forrest stepped outside for consecutive jumpers and Bayfield trailed 15-7 
inside the seven-minute mark.</p> 
<p>McCoy answered with two inside, but another Forrest jumper then a steal and 
deuce from Shaffer plus a pair of treys from Forrest had Pagosa in front 25-9 
at 4:50.</p> 
<p>C.J. Bell and Ramsier got two each in the final minutes, but a goal-tending 
call on the Wolverines resulted in a 27-13 Pirate lead at the half.</p> 
<p>Craig Schutz converted an assist from Forrest to open the third, McCoy 
countered with two, then Pirate senior Otis Rand put back an offensive board 
and Przybylski nailed a trey to give Pagosa a 34-15 edge at 6:15.</p> 
<p>Full-court pressure by the Pirates led to a layin from Casey Schutz, a 
reverberating throw-down from Forrest, then a three-point play from Casey 
Schutz and Pagosa led 41-15 at 4:44.</p> 
<p>McCoy ended Bayfield's scoring lull with an inside move, Forrest answered 
with a three-point finish after an assist from Kerry Joe Hilsabeck and C.J. 
Bell got two on the break to make it 44-19 Pirates with 3:05 left in the stanza.
</p> 
<p>Craig Schutz and McCoy traded baskets, then the Pirates got the last four 
of the frame via break-aways from Shaffer and Hilsabeck; Pagosa was up 50-21 
after three.</p> 
<p>Przybylski found Craig Schutz on the break for the first deuce of the 
fourth, McCoy and Travis Phelps got two apiece for Bayfield, then Shaffer hit a 
baseline jumper to give Pagosa a 54-25 edge with an even five minutes to play.
</p> 
<p>C.J. Bell scored with a drive, then both teams opened up from behind the 
arc as Shaffer drilled a pair of treys to counter a three ball from Colton Bell 
and the Pirates held a 60-30 lead at 1:52.</p> 
<p>After Bayfield's Brad Kujath tallied a final deuce for the visitors, Pirate 
sophomore Adam Trujillo put home an offensive board and the books closed with 
Pagosa on top 62-32.</p> 
<p>Forrest topped Pagosa's scoring column for the evening with 17 points, 
followed by Shaffer with a dozen and Craig and Casey Schutz with twin totals of 
11.</p> 
<p>Przybylski inked eight assists to lead Pagosa while Hilsabeck added six 
dishes to the win, which pushed the Pirates' overall record to 13-1, 3-0 in the 
IML.</p> 
<p>Head Coach Jim Shaffer was pleased with his team's performance during the 
win.</p> 
<p>&quot;Bayfield really tries to control the tempo and limit the amount of 
their opponents' possessions,&quot; said Shaffer after the game. &quot;And I 
thought we adjusted well to handle that style of play tonight.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's sometimes tough for us to be patient because we like to get out 
and run, but the guys didn't force the issue and did a good job of taking what 
was available,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p>With respect to his team's defensive effort, &quot;There were a few times 
in the fourth when we gave up some easy baskets, but in general I thought we 
played hard on defense, which is what makes us go,&quot; said Shaffer.</p> 
<p>As for this week's road game at Ignacio, &quot;It'll be a tough one; 
they're quick, they're aggressive and they can shoot the ball really 
well,&quot; said Shaffer.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll just have to play to our strengths and keep trying to improve 
on the things we already do well,&quot; he concluded.</p> 
<p>Game time for Friday's Pagosa-Ignacio clash in the Ignacio High School gym 
is 7 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Monte no match for hometown Pirates in 77-30 blowou </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>It still qualifies as a basketball rivalry, but the showdown between Pagosa 
Springs and Monte Vista has been rather one-sided lately.</p> 
<p>And the trend in Pagosa's domination of the Pirates from the San Luis 
Valley continued Friday night inside the PSHS gym.</p> 
<p>Behind 49 combined points from junior Craig Schutz and senior Caleb 
Forrest, the hometown Pirates cruised to a 77-30 win, upping their season 
record to 12-1 and Intermountain League mark to 2-0.</p> 
<p>The visitors controlled the tip, but failed to convert and soon found 
themselves down 8-0 after assists from Pagosa junior Paul Przybylski netted 
seven from Craig Schutz and a free throw from Forrest.</p> 
<p>Sigi Rodriguez hit a charity toss to break the ice for Monte, Forrest got 
two with a turnaround jumper, then Monte's Kyle Jones completed a three-point 
play to make it 10-4 Pagosa with just over two minutes gone in the opening 
frame. </p> 
<p>Forrest answered a jumper from Brendon Anderson with a follow-up jam, 
Chester Hatton cut the lead back to four with two inside, then senior Otis Rand 
hit Craig Schutz for a trey to make it 15-8 at 3:25.</p> 
<p>Pagosa sophomores Kerry Joe Hilsabeck and Jordan Shaffer hooked up for two 
on the break, then Przybylski fed Forrest and Craig Schutz for two apiece and 
the home team led 21-8 at 1:27.</p> 
<p>Cliff Shaw and Scott Myers added four to Monte's total in the final minute, 
but Casey Schutz sank a pair at the line and Craig Schutz added a three-point 
play to give Pagosa a 26-12 lead after one.</p> 
<p>Craig Schutz scored with a drive early in the second, and Pagosa held Monte 
to only three points in the quarter while getting nine straight from Forrest 
down the stretch to lead 37-15 at the half.</p> 
<p>Forrest and Craig Schutz continued their offensive onslaught early in the 
third, outscoring Monte 12-2 to give Pagosa a 49-17 advantage midway through 
the period.</p> 
<p>Pagosa used a smothering defense to further the lead, getting six from 
board-crashing Rand, plus a deuce from Shaffer and four from Craig Schutz to go 
up 61-17 late in the quarter.</p> 
<p>Mitch Schaefer sank a pair at the line for Monte with 17 seconds remaining, 
but Casey Schutz drained a deep three just before the horn sounded and Pagosa 
entered the final quarter on top 64-19.</p> 
<p>Casey Schutz hit sophomore Caleb Ormonde on the break for Pagosa's first 
deuce of the fourth, then Przybylski and Hilsabeck took turns at the foul line 
to make it 69-19 with 6:04 to play.</p> 
<p>Shaffer matched a trey from Monte's Curtis Barbosa with a three-point play, 
then Jones and Pagosa sophomore Casey Hart traded two apiece to make it 74-24 
at 3:40.</p> 
<p>Then Przybylski pushed a steal ahead to Shaffer for a deuce, Jones polished 
off a three-point play for Monte at the line and Pagosa sophomore Adam Trujillo 
added a late free throw to make it 77-27.</p> 
<p>Shaw and Anderson combined for three additional Monte points in the 
remaining 90 seconds, but Pagosa got its second IML win at the horn by a final 
margin of 77-30. </p> 
<p>Craig Schutz led all scorers with 27 points and pulled down seven rebounds. 
Not far behind was Forrest, who finished with 22 points and nine boards.</p> 
<p>Przybylski dished out six assists and recorded three steals in the win, 
while Hilsabeck added four assists and five thefts.</p> 
<p>In a postgame interview, Head Coach Jim Shaffer reflected on his Pagosa 
team's effort in the win.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's still a lot of season left, but I think if we can play with 
that type of intensity and determination from here on out, we'll be in good 
shape come tournament time,&quot; said Shaffer.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think the thing I was most pleased with was our defense,&quot; he 
added. &quot;It sets the tone for everything we do, and tonight we got a lot of 
good looks and easy baskets in transition because we stepped it up at the 
defensive end.&quot;</p> 
<p>Regarding the following night's matchup with Bayfield, &quot;Coming into 
the season I would have said they were the league favorites,&quot; said Shaffer.
</p> 
<p>&quot;They've been up and down so far, but they've got a lot of talent, so 
we just have to come to play and take care of business,&quot; he concluded.</p> 
<p>Next up for Pagosa is a road game Friday at Ignacio. Game time is 7 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Pirate wrestlers end regular season; regional tournament next up </b></p>
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>When you compete in a tough league, against a tough team, in a dual meet 
that will affect the league standings, the bonus points weigh heavy on the 
outcome.</p> 
<p>It was the Centauri Falcons who scored the greater number of bonus points 
Jan. 27 as they defeated the Pirates 44-36 in a dual held in the PSHS gym.</p> 
<p>Prior to the meet, Coach Dan Janowsky predicted the final result would 
depend on the bonus point factor - on the additional points scored with major 
decisions, technical falls and pins. Had the Falcons not scored maximum points 
with falls in several matches, the result might have been different.</p> 
<p>Pagosa started the dual with a 6-0 lead as the Falcons forfeited at 171 
pounds.</p> 
<p>In the first match wrestled, at 189 pounds, Marcus Rivas lost a tough 
battle as a last-second takedown was disallowed when the referee called him for 
grabbing his opponent's headgear. Louden David was awarded the penalty point 
and got a 7-4 win.</p> 
<p>Bubba Martinez increased the early Pirate lead to 12-3 as he dominated Matt 
Jaramillo of the Falcons at 215. Martinez got the initial takedown of the match 
then, with less than a minute elapsed in the first period, put the Falcon's 
shoulders down.</p> 
<p>Joe Romine lost to Centauri's Martin Maez in a fall at 275.</p> 
<p>At 103, Travis Moore faced yet another in the Polkowski dynasty at Centauri 
- Mitchell Polkowski. The Falcon pinned Moore in the second period and Centauri 
took a 15-12 lead in the team score.</p> 
<p>Josh Nelson battled the Falcons' Mitchell Buhr at 112 and was pinned. 
Centauri was ahead 21-12.</p> 
<p>The Falcon lead advanced to 27-12 as Centauri's Rory Keys pinned Orion 
Sandoval at 119.</p> 
<p>Then, it was Pagosa's turn to earn some bonus points.</p> 
<p>Daren Hockett squared off against Centauri's Aaron Quinlan at 125. Hockett 
got the first takedown and let Quinlan up for a point. The reason to let the 
Falcon up? To take him down again. Hockett had a 4-1 lead at the end of the 
first period. </p> 
<p>Hockett started down in the second period, escaped for a point, took 
Quinlan down and scored a three-point near fall. The Pirate scored six points 
with the pin at the 3:22 mark.</p> 
<p>The Pirates forfeited at 130 and the Falcons had a 33-18 lead.</p> 
<p>Raul Palmer met a rough customer at 135 - Jacob Sheridan, arguably one of 
the state's best at the weight. Sheridan established that fact with an 11-0 
lead after the first period and a 16-0 tech fall called halfway through the 
second period of the match. The win put the Falcons in front 38-18.</p> 
<p>Centauri forfeited at 140.</p> 
<p>Cody Shawcroft of Centauri got the win with a fall at 145 over Manuel 
Madrid.</p> 
<p>With the opponents leading 44-24, Pagosa's Paul Armijo aimed for some 
redemption at 152.</p> 
<p>The senior has been wrestling very well lately, and he continued to do so 
against Brian Atencio.</p> 
<p>Armijo built a 6-3 first period lead, taking Atencio down then letting him 
up to set up another takedown. </p> 
<p>Atencio started down in the second period and Armijo released him. The 
Pirate took Atencio down, released him and took him down again. Ahead 10-5, 
Armijo put an end to the game, pinning Atencio at 3:50.</p> 
<p>Centauri forfeited at 160 and the win belonged to the visitors from the 
Valley.</p> 
<p>Janowsky affirmed his pre-meet theory.</p> 
<p>&quot;It went almost like I thought it would,&quot; he said. &quot;I think 
it went better than I would have guessed at 189 - that was the best Marcus has 
wrestled all year. When I look back on the meet I think, but for a couple 
matches, we exceeded our expectations.&quot;</p> 
<p>At the Ignacio tournament Saturday, the Pirates wrapped up the regular 
season schedule with a third-place finish in the seven team event.</p> 
<p>Bayfield won the tournament with 147 points. Piedra Vista took second with 
136.5 points; the Pirates were right behind with 136.</p> 
<p>Pagosa had two champions at Ignacio: Hockett at 125 and Armijo at 152.</p> 
<p>Hockett wrestled a little more than two minutes in two tourney matches. The 
Pirate senior drew a first-round bye then pinned Chris Simon of Bayfield in the 
first period of the semifinal match. In the final, Hockett repeated his 
performance, getting the fall in the first period over a Dolores wrestler. </p> 
<p>Armijo also made short work of two opponents on his way to the title.</p> 
<p>Following a first-round bye, Armijo finished off a Piedra Vista wrestler in 
the second period. In the final, an opponent from Dove Creek was dispatched in 
the first period. </p> 
<p>Two Pirates finished in second place at the tournament: Ky Smith at 140 and 
Madrid at 145.</p> 
<p>Smith had a bye in the first round then got a third-period pin over a 
Dolores wrestler in the semi. Smith took second when he lost to a Piedra Vista 
athlete in the final. </p> 
<p>Madrid also drew a bye to start the day, then forged a 9-6 decision over a 
Piedra Vista opponent. A loss to a Dove Creek wrestler put Madrid in second 
place.</p> 
<p>Four Pirates ended the day in fourth place in their respective weight 
classes.</p> 
<p>Sandoval took fourth at 119, losing his first match of the day to Matt 
Jones of Ignacio in a 4-2 decision. Following byes in the consolation round, 
Sandoval was ahead of a Dolores wrestler 9-0 when the Bear took an injury 
default. That put Sandoval against Jones for a second time. Sandoval got the 
win with a 7-2 decision.</p> 
<p>Matt Nobles was third at 160. The junior lost his first match of the day 
then drew byes in the consolation round up to the third-place match. In that 
match, Nobles got the win in a decision over Jared Jones of Ignacio.</p> 
<p>Marcus Rivas fought only two matches to capture third at 189. Rivas lost a 
4-3 decision to a Piedra Vista wrestler then scored a 10-7 decision over an 
opponent from Dolores.</p> 
<p>Joe Romine fought three battles on the way to third place at 275. Romine 
lost his first match to Greg Kinney of Bayfield then put together two 
consecutive pins - over competitors from Dove Creek and Mancos - to secure 
third place.</p> 
<p>Nelson took fourth place at 112. Nelson pinned Brian Murphy of Mancos in 
the second period then lost to Ignacio's Nick Naranjo. A 10-2 win over a Dove 
Creek wrestler put Nelson in a losing battle for third against a Bayfield 
opponent.</p> 
<p>The team score at Ignacio was affected by the loss of three starters from 
the lineup - Justin Moore (171), Palmer (135) and Martinez (215). Both Palmer 
and Martinez have won 20 or more matches this year.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our finish was encouraging, considering we didn't have those guys 
with us,&quot; said Janowsky.</p> 
<p>The athletes are expected to be on the mat Friday as the regional 
tournament opens at Monte Vista. The five IML teams will be joined at regionals 
by Colorado Springs Christian, Manitou Springs, St. Mary's, Rock Canyon, Platte 
Canyon, Florence and Trinidad.</p> 
<p>Odds are good the IML teams will be among the strongest at the tourney. 
Four athletes in each weight class advance to the state tournament at Denver 
the following week. </p> 
<p>&quot;Monte Vista won the league,&quot; said the coach, &quot;and, 
teamwise, they are sitting pretty good coming into the regional tournament. But 
- Centauri, Bayfield, us - I think we're all in the hunt. The IML is strong, 
but all the teams there will have some good individuals.&quot;</p> 
<p>As far as the Pirates' chances go, Janowsky is optimistic that a number of 
the local wrestlers can place in the top four and move on. The team's 
performance at the regional tournament last year has to figure in any 
assessment since the Pirates finished last in the IML last season, yet won the 
regional event.</p> 
<p>&quot;We've struggled of late,&quot; said the coach, &quot;and we'll have 
to see who shows up Friday and Saturday. We have the potential to do very 
well.&quot;</p> 
<p>Action at Monte Vista begins Friday at 2 p.m. Friday's schedule includes 
the first round, the championship quarterfinals and two rounds of consolation.
</p> 
<p>The tourney starts anew Saturday at 9 a.m. with championship semifinals 
followed by third round consolation.</p> 
<p>Consolation semifinals are set for 1 p.m. followed by matches for third, 
fourth, fifth and sixth places. Wrestlebacks will follow the sixth-place 
matches.</p> 
<p>The championship round is scheduled for 6 p.m. </p>

<p><b>Pirates convert cold first half into Jewell of a win over Bayfield </b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Tell a coach his team is going to shoot 11 of 35 from the floor and just 
four of 15 from the foul line - in the first half - and you may have him out 
searching for headache remedies at the break.</p> 
<p>That performance was offset by the torrid shooting of Pagosa senior guard 
Bri Scott with 13 of her 18 game points in the half.</p> 
<p>Almost everyone else was having trouble even drawing iron Saturday against 
Bayfield.</p> 
<p>From the rest of the Pirates, Coach Bob Lynch got single first-period 
markers from Lori Walkup and Caitlyn Jewell for an 11-5 lead after one.</p> 
<p>Bayfield's points came on a field goal from Ashley Shaw, who would lead her 
team in the game with 11 points, and three from the line by Kelsey Dean.</p> 
<p>The second period was a 17-10 effort for Pagosa but shots were still 
clanking off the metal or prompting cries of &quot;Air Ball! Air Ball!&quot; 
from the Wolverine faithful.</p> 
<p>Scott stayed hot with a pair of treys. Kelley, on what would be her poorest 
shooting night of the season percentagewise, converted one field goal and three 
from the line. Walkup had a field goal and Jewell a pair.</p> 
<p>Whitney Howard and Rheanna Moe each had a deuce for Bayfield, Shaw and Moe 
adding single free throws, freshman Alexis Pommier chipping in a pair from the 
stripe.</p> 
<p>And so, at the half, Lynch called on his seniors to step it up.</p> 
<p>Jewell, the 6-2 senior center for the Pirates, after six first half points, 
erupted for 15 in the second half and a game-high 21.</p> 
<p>&quot;Were we up just 28-15 at the half,&quot; he noted afterward. &quot;We 
needed a spark and Caitlyn certainly provided it.&quot;</p> 
<p>That spark might have been more correctly described as a conflagration. She 
drilled six of six from the floor in the period and added a free throw.</p> 
<p>Thus, Bayfield's 13-point deficit was suddenly at 29 points after the 
Pirate third-period effort. </p> 
<p>While Jewell led the assault, she wasn't alone. Scott kept a hot hand, 
drilling her third trey and a deuce, Jessica Lynch added an 8-foot jumper and 
Emily Buikema and Caitlin Forrest each had a deuce.</p> 
<p>The Pirates then went on a 19-9 spree in the fourth period to wrap up a 
73-34 victory.</p> 
<p>Walkup was the key element in the early fourth period assault for Pagosa, 
hitting three in a row from the field. And she picked off two more rebounds in 
the period, giving her 10 for the game and the double-double she missed by one 
rebound the night before against Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>Kari Beth Faber, rounding out an excellent role in support of the starting 
cast, had a deuce. She also had four rebounds and an assist in the game and was 
a part of the second half defensive crackdown. Jewell added one more field goal 
before taking the rest of the night off, as did Buikema.</p> 
<p>Lynch converted a pair from the stripe where Kelley also notched three to 
go with a final field goal that kept her in double figures (10 for the fourth 
consecutive game.</p> 
<p>It is important to note that Lynch started only three of his regular 
starters in the game, and substituted freely in all but the third period when 
the seniors put on their show. And, for the last 2:58 of the contest, only 
junior varsity players were on the court for Pagosa.</p> 
<p>That fact is offered to counteract what many people saw but did not 
understand immediately after the game. </p> 
<p>As players and coaches lined up for the traditional post-game handshake, a 
Wolverine fan came on the floor and verbally accosted Lynch for &quot;running 
up the score.&quot;</p> 
<p>He called Lynch &quot;the worst piece of (vulgarity) I've ever seen&quot; 
and vowed to protest the score to Colorado High School Activities Association 
officials.</p> 
<p>Lynch, to his credit, merely turned and walked away with his team through 
the handshake line.</p> 
<p>For the game, after the terrible shooting early, Pagosa was 29 of 65 from 
the floor for a .446 percentage; Bayfield was 12 of 32 for a .373 percentage. 
Pagosa converted 11 of 25 from the line, Bayfield 10 of 21. Pagosa outrebounded 
the Wolverines 49-10.</p> 
<p>And, Pagosa had nine blocked shots, three by Jewell, two by Buikema and one 
each by Kelley, Scott, Walkup and Forrest.</p> 
<p>The victory put Pagosa's record at 9-5 on the season, 3-0 in the 
Intermountain league, with one game on the docket this week.</p> 
<p>The Pirates travel to Ignacio Friday for a contest against the Bobcats - 
1-6 overall and 1-2 in the conference, the lone win being over Bayfield 60-49 
in Bayfield.</p> 
<p>But, some observers say, Ignacio may be better than the record indicates, 
with a young freshman pacing them on good nights and some veterans beginning to 
come into their own. In their own house, they always give Pagosa a tough 
encounter. </p>

<p><b>Pagosans press Monte, put four in double figures for 74-35 win </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Trigger your ball cops with a pressure defense and you can shut down just 
about anyone.</p> 
<p>Want proof?</p> 
<p>Ask Monte Vista's Tabitha Gutierrez, a 5-8 senior guard and one of the 
leading scorers in the state (159 total) coming into the San Luis Valley 
Pirates' game Friday in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Pirate press had her firing away from off-balance positions all 
night.</p> 
<p>In fact, she converted only two of 13 inside the arc and took just two 
three-pointers, hitting one.</p> 
<p>The result?</p> 
<p>A Pagosa fast break coming off the effective press and a runaway 74-35 
victory for the homestanding Pagosans.</p> 
<p>Monte's other offensive threat, the highly touted Mary Beth Miles did get 
double figure scoring - 11 points - but had none in the middle two frames.</p> 
<p>Pagosa, meanwhile, was rolling offensively, with a different leader every 
period and ended with four players in double figures for the first time this 
year. In fact, they were a rebound short of having the first double-double of 
the year. Lori Walkup, with 16 points and nine rebounds had the chance but was 
pulled with three minutes left to give junior varsity players court time.</p> 
<p>Miles got the game's first points on a drive from the left side. </p> 
<p>But Monte Vista would never see the lead again.</p> 
<p>Pagosa's 6-2 senior Caitlyn Jewell made sure of that. Working both sides of 
the deep lane, she poured in six on three straight off high post screens by 
Emily Buikema.</p> 
<p>Miles got a pair at the charity stripe, cutting the lead to 6-4 Pagosa. </p>
<p>Liza Kelley, who would be the game's high scorer with 17, drilled a trey, 
then Walkup hit consecutive short jumpers.</p> 
<p>Meredith Schaefer got a deuce for Monte, but the writing was already on the 
hardwood.</p> 
<p>Jessica Lynch dropped in a 6-foot jumper for Pagosa and then Caitlin 
Forrest put the cap on a 17-8 Pagosa first quarter with a spinning left-handed 
hook in the lane.</p> 
<p>The second period was more of the same. But this time it was senior guard 
Bri Scott leading the way for Pagosa with 12 markers in the frame.</p> 
<p>Gutierrez opened with a deuce for the visitors and Schaefer followed suit, 
converting off a poor Pirate pass in the front line, cutting the Pagosa lead to 
17-12.</p> 
<p>Scott then ripped three in a row on baseline drives, the last a reverse 
lay-up. Buikema joined the fray with an offensive rebound putback and Forrest 
hit from the right side. Kelley drilled a pair for four Pagosa points but 
Angelica Salvio answered with a trey and lay-up for Monte. Sophomore Claire 
Quintanilla also scored for the visitors.</p> 
<p>But Scott was having nothing to do with a visitor comeback. In the last 
minute of the half she tickled twine twice from beyond the arc and Pagosa had a 
38-20 lead at the break.</p> 
<p>Any thoughts Monte might have had of a second half comeback died in a 
withering Pagosa press that limited the visitors to just four shots from the 
floor in the period and a total of three points, all by senior Erin McAuliffe.
</p> 
<p>Kelley, meanwhile, was driving inside and dishing off - or scoring herself 
- as she led an 18-point Pagosa spree with three deuces. She wasn't alone.</p> 
<p>Walkup drilled a pair, as did Buikema and Scott; Lynch and Jewell each 
added one from the field.</p> 
<p>Gutierrez finally broke the drought to open the fourth period with a 
three-pointer for Monte and later converted a free throw. With Pagosa reserves 
in the game, Miles got back into the scoring column with two field goals and a 
charity toss, and junior Amy Hart scored for Monte, her only points of the game.
</p> 
<p>But it was Walkup's turn to become floor leader for a period, bagging four 
deuces from different spots on the floor, the prettiest a pull-up 12-foot 
jumper over Miles, who is two inches taller.</p> 
<p>Kelley drilled two more field goals for Pagosa and Jewell and Forrest each 
added single two-pointers in another 18-point Pagosa quarter en route to the 
final 74-35 score.</p> 
<p>Pagosa was only two for nine from three-point land, but shot a withering 30 
of 59 from inside the arc. Strangely, the home team went to the foul line only 
five times and converted just one (Kelley).</p> 
<p>Monte, conversely was seven for eight from the line. </p> 
<p>Walkup's scoring binge was based on eight-for-11 from the floor but 
zero-for-four from the line. </p> 
<p>The Pagosa Pirate board work was outstanding, leading the visitors 34-12 
paced by Walkup's nine and five for Forrest.</p> 
<p>Back in action at the varsity level after rehab with the junior varsity 
from a severe ankle injury, China Rose Rivas was zero-for-two from the field 
but had a defensive rebound and an assist on Forrest's last basket.</p> 
<p>Sophomores Kim Canty, Kristen DuCharme and Lindsay Mackey each picked up an 
offensive rebound in their time on the floor and Mackey missed her only shot 
attempt. The other reserve, Alaina Garman, scored two from the line.</p>

<p><b>Addressing concerns of sports parents </b> </p> 
<p><b>By Myles Gabel </b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Consider these thoughts on sports parenting myths by Rick Wolff, chairman 
of the Center for Sports Parenting.</p> 
<p>&quot;One of the constant concerns about trying to raise a youngster in 
sports these days is that there is so much misinformation and misleading advice 
that parents often don't know where to turn.</p> 
<p>&quot;As such, here are highlights of some of the more common sports 
parenting 'myths,' so that parents and coaches can get a better lay of the land 
when it comes to working with their kids. The sooner your child specializes in 
just one sport, the better chance they have of advancing to a higher level 
(e.g. college, professional ranks).</p> 
<p>&quot;Most of today's top professional athletes didn't even think to 
specialize in just one sport until they were in high school, around the age of 
15. When they were younger, they played a variety of sports, depending on the 
season. Some coaches will pressure kids to play just one sport. As a parent, 
you should be wary of this! The very best time to teach your youngster how to 
improve their play is immediately after the game; ideally, in the car ride on 
the way home while their game actions are still fresh in their mind.</p> 
<p>&quot;In most cases, that's absolutely the worst time to critique your 
child! Wait until a quiet moment later in the evening, or the next day. 
Evaluating your child's game right after the match is finished will drive them 
away from the sport - and from you! A youngster who is a top athlete among his 
or her peers at age 8 is clearly destined to be a star when they're 18. While 
this happens sometimes, more times than not, it doesn't.</p> 
<p>&quot;There is very little predictive value when it comes to saying an 8 
year-old will grow to be a superior athlete when they're 18. There are too many 
factors that might influence how that athlete will develop when it comes to 
sports. The younger you can get your child on a travel team, the better. In 
some teams, travel teams start as early as age 5 or 6.</p> 
<p>&quot;That's nonsense. Nobody has ever produced a scientific study that 
shows that having your child play on a travel team at a very early age is going 
to guarantee athletic success down the road. However, on the other side of the 
coin, there are lots of studies that show that burnout is a real problem and 
usually affects kids who have been playing one sport for a long, long time on a 
travel team.</p> 
<p>&quot;Creatine, as well as other nutritional supplements such as Andro and 
ephedra, that are sold in health stores have been proven to be safe for kids; 
otherwise, it would be illegal for the stores to sell these products. While 
creatine, Andro, and ephedra products are legal in most states, that does not 
mean that they are healthy for your youngster. Be forewarned!</p> 
<p>&quot;There are no long range medical or scientific studies that show that 
these supplements are safe to ingest! Sportsmanship is something that can only 
be taught by your child's coach.</p> 
<p>&quot;Not quite. In fact, being a good sport starts with you - his or her 
parent. First, starting when they're young, you should teach your child how to 
behave not only after a loss, but also after a win. Explain to them the right 
way to act. Secondly, during the heat of games, you have to set a positive 
example of how to behave because kids watch carefully to see how you react when 
things aren't going your way.</p> 
<p>&quot;Kids will be happy as long as they are part of a winning team. No, 
this is not true. All kids prefer to play - and play a lot - on a losing or 
not-so-good team, so long as they're playing in the games - rather than play 
only sparingly on a championship team. The vast majority of moms and dads tend 
to be honest and fairly objective about their child's ability in sports.</p> 
<p>&quot;While we like to think we are, the truth is - we really aren't. Most 
parents see their child as being better looking, smarter than the other kids, 
and certainly at least as athletically talented, if not more so, than the 
others. Relax, make sure your child is having fun. After all, it's all just 
part of being a sports parent.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Skating ponds are a problem, carvings set to begin </b></p> 
<p><b>By Joe Lister Jr.</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist </b></p> 
<p>For the past few weeks it has been very difficult to maintain the skate 
pond.</p> 
<p>The rain we got just after the first of the year only made things worse. We 
are weather watching, to figure out a time and day to resurface the pond. The 
optimum temperatures for resurfacing are from 4-10 below zero.</p> 
<p>Jim Miller and crew will hopefully be on the pond after this front passes. 
The difficult part is the crews spend so much time and energy in snow removal, 
then the front brings in the colder temperatures for the resurfacing, and the 
crews are usually running on fumes.</p> 
<p>Add to all of this the fact temperatures are usually lowest late in the 
evening; it makes for a long day or week for the crew.</p> 
<p>Tree carvings</p> 
<p>We have given the go-ahead to start the carvings on the old cottonwood 
trees in the Town Park. The park crew will cut the trees to the size Chad 
Haspels needs to start the work.</p> 
<p>Pictures of the proposed sculptures can be seen at Town Hall in the parks 
and recreation offices.</p> 
<p>How we pick teams</p> 
<p>Every year it seems we need to educate parents, grandparents, aunts, and 
uncles about how we pick teams in our youth sports programs.</p> 
<p>Over the past three years we have developed a draft system that insures 
each team has a No. 1 draft pick, and we go down the line in order so every 
team has the same amount of No. 2s, No. 3s, and so on, down the line. If you 
end up with eight players per team, and the coaches use the mandatory 
substitution grid (to insure all players have equal playing time), all teams 
should be pretty fairly matched.</p> 
<p>What throws the grid off are kids who do not show up, and one team has six 
players and the other team has more. This allows a No. 1 and 2 player more 
playing minutes, and since the substitution and equal playing time grid is a 
little off, it sometimes seems unfair.</p> 
<p>We need to look at this very closely, because the people who suffer from 
this end up being at a disadvantage in the game itself.</p> 
<p>I try to relax when my son's team is affected, to remember that recreation 
basketball is just that -- recreation - a town sponsored physical education 
class. All players, no matter what level skill level they have, can gain from 
the experience.</p> 
<p>My biggest joys are to see a kid who might not have the best self-esteem 
gain acceptance in an arena where he or she normally would not make friends. 
The experiences and relationships will be lifelong. The youngster will remember 
the relationship he or she had with a coach, parent and fellow participant.</p> 
<p>The other part of the learning curve is for the adults to understand that 
all kids are at different levels with different learning skills, and that 
maturity levels are very different. We, as coaches or administrators, have made 
special rules to ensure all players have equal playing time and that every once 
in awhile you get a prodigy child who dominates.</p> 
<p>Enjoy the fact they have a given talent and that, with our substitution 
rules, play equal time. Understand it is not fair to hold them back from 
enjoying the game. Our program is attempting to make it fair for all young 
athletes.</p> 
<p>Many of the more advanced players participate in other leagues or club 
sports. There, the coaches can pick and choose players, as well as the amount 
of time an individual child will play in any given game. Parents knowingly sign 
their child up to give young athletes who want to work on their skills, and 
play in a more competitive environment the chance to do so.</p> 
<p>Not all recreation or competitive experiences are positive, but you have to 
try to always put the child's learning and enjoyment of participation first and 
foremost. Basketball, baseball or soccer will have volunteer coaches who know 
more than others, however these coaches have stepped up for your children. If 
they are not learning or winning as much as you would like, we need to visit 
about private camps, private clubs available for these kids. But, before all of 
this occurs, ask your child, &quot;Do you want to play or try to play at a more 
competitive level?&quot; If the answer is yes, you will require a bigger 
commitment.</p> 
<p>Again, thank you for your involvement, especially the coaches and, among 
them, the rookies. It takes a lot of nerve to get up and coach in front of

<p><b>Lots of light, please </b></p> 
<p>Now the Colorado Legislature is back in session one issue domi-nates the 
scene - the budget problem faced by the state, the need to deal with revenue 
and spending constraints that have a stranglehold on state government's ability 
to deal with basic concerns.</p> 
<p>Outside the glare given off by battles over modifications to TABOR some of 
our elected officials are back at a task they undertake every year - 
attempting, bit by little bit, to further erode our ability to obtain the 
information we need to operate as members of a free society and in a functional 
representative democracy. When they succeed, they're closer to removing us from 
effective roles in key political, social and economic processes, making us more 
reliant on prepackaged information, on sources whose motives are often less 
than supportive of the common good.</p> 
<p>There is little in the public domain that should be kept secret, yet we are 
repeatedly faced with the actions of politicos who would enact laws and use 
existing laws to keep the public from knowing as much as possible, keeping 
themselves, their cohorts and their interests out of the public eye. A review 
of some of the bills introduced during the first weeks of the current session 
shows the work is again underway - in some cases relative to seemingly 
unimportant matters, at other times aiming for more.</p> 
<p>One bill would make financial investment information related to police and 
fire pension funds confidential. Another would require public health analysis 
of proposed rules, with proprietary information in the regulatory analyses kept 
confidential. Yet another would make underage alcohol violations confidential.
</p> 
<p>Senate Bill 69 would remove the names from the required semi-annual public 
notice list of county employee salaries. Why? It is taxpayers' money that is 
spent. We need to know who does what, and for how much, if we are to judge who 
is overpaid or who earns too little for the services they provide.</p> 
<p>Then, there is this year's version of the attempt to ease local 
governments' obligations to publish legal notices in publications of record, 
allowing them, rather, to publish the legal notices and bills on their Web 
sites. To argue that traditional forms of publication of legal notice are 
conventional and commonly accessible and that government Web sites are not 
available to significant numbers of voters should suffice. To note our own town 
government has largely failed in its promise to publish accounts on its Web 
site only adds to the argument against the idea.</p> 
<p>Pass or fail, these bills, and more to come, are a sign there is no lack of 
energy among solons when it comes to finding ways, however small, of secreting 
information.</p> 
<p>It goes on at all levels of government, and we must stay on the alert, 
demanding openness.</p> 
<p>In smaller units of government there are recurrent attempts on the part of 
some elected officials and administrators to keep information from the clear 
light of day. It is not uncommon to find boards of tax-supported entities using 
any excuse, however slim, to go into executive session to do business and, upon 
reconvening in regular session, to speed past the general outline of content. 
We argue there are very few matters that should be handled in executive session 
- it is an option exercised too often.</p> 
<p>It is not uncommon to find a quorum of members of a board gathering outside 
noticed public meetings, discussing issues and making decisions in a situation 
without notice or access.</p> 
<p>Vigilance is necessary. Those of us who wish to make informed choices must 
demand our representatives reject law that encourages secrecy in the public 
sector and, in their day-to-day doings, that they kick open the door at every 
opportunity to let the light shine in.</p>

<p><b>Field of flakes and free thinkers</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>There are many characters in the journalism profession. Some have talents 
never challenged and others should logically have found a different line of 
work.</p> 
<p>It has been my great fortune to work with some of the finest in the nation, 
to train aspiring newcomers to the field and see them advance into the top 
ranks of the fourth estate legion.</p> 
<p>It has also been my misfortune to work with several who should have found 
another line of work; and encouraged some to do so.</p> 
<p>One such was a well-educated young man who was from a long line of plumbing 
and hardware store operators. He wanted to be different.</p> 
<p>But despite his education and desire, there was one trait that proved an 
immeasurable drawback. He was allergic to people, could not go out in a crowd, 
could not cover a public meeting without coming back in a rash.</p> 
<p>One of the greatest reporters I ever knew was a product of the old line 
journalism schools. He got his start on a small daily in Indiana and one of his 
first assignments was as wire editor.</p> 
<p>Now, in those days, Associated Press was the wire service, and there was no 
transmission to hard copy. A man in Chicago, or Philadelphia or Atlanta - 
whatever zone your newspaper was in - would read the news in a conference call 
to a group of individual newspaper representatives. There were no repeats, no 
questions. Get it the first time or not at all.</p> 
<p>He had never learned to type the asdf-jkl; routine we got in high school. 
He was the classic hunt-and-peck typist whose fingers flew across the keyboard, 
two on each hand beating out usually readable copy. He knew all the right 
people, knew all the background of every story, and never gave a biased report 
in his life.</p> 
<p>Then there was the fledgling reporter who believed his copy sacrosanct and 
above need for revision. He became intensely angry when even a single word was 
changed in his reportage.</p> 
<p>One day a copy editor found an obviously errant &quot;fact&quot; in his 
copy and changed it. The reporter literally went berserk, threatening bodily 
harm. I picked him up with a hand in each arm pit, carried him across the 
newsroom and sat him down in his own chair with directions for him to stay 
until told to move. </p> 
<p>He later apologized for his actions. Years later he was still calling me 
from spots across the nation for advice on how to handle a sticky news event.
</p> 
<p>I once worked with a female reporter who was highly into the feminist 
independence movement. Having been raised to treat women with respect, I once 
opened the front door to our building for her and got it shoved back in my face 
with this comment: &quot;I don't need any help. I can open a door by 
myself.&quot;</p> 
<p>I also worked with a staff photographer who was very good - when you could 
find him, but who had a knack for leaving the staff car unlocked in undesirable 
locations and returning to find much of his photo gear stolen. Like every other 
profession, journalism has its share of flakes, free thinkers and some of the 
most highly intelligent and concerned people in the world</p>

<p><b>Sexual assault danger continues to be underreported </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;I thought if there was ever anything going on with my child, I'd know 
it.</p> 
<p>&quot;I was wrong.&quot;</p> 
<p>That was part of the message about The Quiet Threat of childhood sexual 
assault Lisa Carmen wanted Kiwanis Club members and guests to hear Friday night 
at a public presentation at the community center.</p> 
<p>On Jan. 7, 2005, Carmen's family discovered her 5-year-old daughter was 
being sexually abused by the teen-age son of their daycare provider. The 
families were good friends.</p> 
<p>As the investigation continued, Carmen learned her daughter remembered 
assaults going back to at least age 3. She had been at the same daycare since 
age 1. The teen-ager, who Carmen calls Michael in her talks, has admitted to at 
least 70 different assaults involving both Carmen's daughter and another girl 
in his mother's care.</p> 
<p>&quot;The people who sexually assault our children are the people who can 
get close to them,&quot; the Littleton mother said. She had been invited to 
Pagosa Springs to give a free presentation about the threat.</p> 
<p>&quot;After this happened, my husband and I just kept saying 'Why didn't we 
know this?'&quot; Carmen said.</p> 
<p>Why didn't they know that somewhere in the neighborhood of 90-94 percent of 
sexual assaults are committed by someone known to the abuser? Why didn't they 
know to explain things about good touch and bad touch to their child starting 
as an infant? Why didn't they know that abusers first build relationships with 
their victims, using that trust to purchase silence and protection?</p> 
<p>Silence, Carmen said, is one of the major problems in issues of sexual 
assault. It hits close to home. It's ugly business. No one wants to believe it 
can happen to them. No one wants to believe they've been betrayed by a person 
in a position of trust. But it happens.</p> 
<p>In Colorado alone, she said, the sex-offender registry contains 8,000 
names. Nationwide, the number of sex offenders reaches 374,270.</p> 
<p>Archuelta County Victims Assistance served 72 clients dealing with sexual 
assault in 2003. Twenty-four of those were children.</p> 
<p>&quot;Those are our program stats only,&quot; Liz Wantusiak stressed, 
adding the number of cases in the area may be higher because it is such an 
under-reported crime.</p> 
<p>Local sex offender registries are available, Carmen said. In her home area 
of Littleton, the registry cost her $2 and contains 98 names. The youngest was 
14. The oldest was 80. Five were women.</p> 
<p>&quot;This list includes everything from peeping toms to indecent exposure 
to sexual assault on a child,&quot; she said. &quot;It is available.&quot;</p> 
<p>In Archuleta County, it can be obtained at the sheriff's department. Anyone 
interested should see Detective George Daniels. Identification as a county 
resident is required.</p> 
<p>Just having the list isn't enough, Carmen said. In fact, being armed with 
information only works if it's shared with others.</p> 
<p>&quot;Talking about child sexual abuse is our first defense against sex 
offenders,&quot; she said. Talking to parents and talking to kids. Carmen 
suggested parents should sit down with their children regularly to discuss 
safety, setting limits and communication.</p> 
<p>She offered seven &quot;Self-Safety Strategies&quot; to teach children:</p> 
<p>- My body is my own and no one else's and I have the right to keep my body 
private.</p> 
<p>- I will trust my heart-feeling and if I feel uncomfortable, scared or 
confused, or if it just feels wrong, I will get away fast then I will tell an 
adult and keep telling until it stops.</p> 
<p>- I will say, &quot;No!&quot; to anyone who wants to touch or look at any 
private part of my body or wants me to touch or look at any private part of 
their body, then I will tell an adult and keep telling until it stops.</p> 
<p>- I will tell an adult about anyone who scares me or threatens me or tells 
me to keep a secret or make a promise not to tell.</p> 
<p>- I will say &quot;No!&quot; to anyone who wants to play a body game with 
me, then I will keep telling until it stops.</p> 
<p>- If I try to tell, and no one helps me, I will call 9-1-1 for help.</p> 
<p>- I understand that when a bigger kid or adult is doing anything with me, I 
will not get in trouble because it is never the little kid's fault.</p> 
<p>Carmen said the &quot;until it stops,&quot; phrase should be stressed 
because many times adults fail to believe children's accusations because the 
offender is known and trusted.</p> 
<p>Reporting such crime is also important, Carmen said. She praised the 
advocates, law enforcement officers and other professionals who worked with her 
family throughout their ordeal. In fact, she said, it was a relief to turn to 
professionals to determine what action to take against the perpetrator.</p> 
<p>&quot;These people were our friends,&quot; Carmen said. &quot;We didn't 
want to do them wrong, we wanted to do right for our child.&quot;</p> 
<p>Working to spread the word about child sexual assault has become Carmen's 
focus since her own family's tragedy. Her daughter remains in counseling and is 
doing well. Michael, who confessed to his crimes, was sentenced to 30 days in 
jail and intensive therapy. Social Services closed the daycare facility.</p> 
<p>Carmen's goal is to take &quot;The Quiet Threat&quot; to the national 
level. Currently, donations are being accepted through the Jeffco Children's 
Alliance. Carmen can be contacted at (303) 933-9564 or lisacarmen@earthlink.net.

<p><b>Be aware of Internet dangers </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>As a child, your parents probably told you to stay away from the seedy 
areas of bars and strange people.</p> 
<p>They were exercising parental guidance before the advent of computer chat 
rooms and the growing threat of cyber predators.</p> 
<p>Now police and teachers are the ones helping youngsters understand who and 
what predators are and how the child's use of a computer can lead to 
confrontations and danger.</p> 
<p>It is no longer the strange looking man lurking in the alley children need 
to be aware of.</p> 
<p>It is the tech-age predator who uses the Internet to identify and track 
down those children he sees as possible conquests.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs Intermediate School teacher Heidi Keshet went to a special 
training session for the &quot;iSafe&quot; program last year, then converted 
her knowledge of the subject into a classroom session involving Pagosa Springs 
Police Officer Floyd Capistrant.</p> 
<p>It was used Thursday and Friday with the two combining to help fifth- and 
sixth-graders know what a cyber predator is, what they want, and how to avoid 
them.</p> 
<p>Capistrant told one group of youngsters to never utilize a computer name or 
password which can give a clue to their identity.</p> 
<p>&quot;Don't use any form of your real name as part of a sign-on,&quot; he 
said. &quot;Don't even hint at your family name, your phone number, your 
friends, Social Security number, age, area of residence or school 
attended.&quot;</p> 
<p>Any one of those factors, Capistrant said, can help the seasoned predator 
accustomed to chat room techniques, find out who you are.</p> 
<p>Just as parents once warned children to not accept gifts or offers of help 
from total strangers, they, the police and the teachers, are now teaming up to 
help children understand who might be watching them on computer links.</p> 
<p>Often, the officer said, predators are monitoring chat room conversations 
without getting involved, just noting phrases exchanged between friends for 
characteristics of the participants.</p> 
<p>They watch for clues to things you like, places you have been, indictions 
of trips and how long they took and then they are able to pinpoint you as a 
target.</p> 
<p>Keshet passed out fliers which compared parents' childhood life to that of 
parents today. Where once the parent warned the child to look both ways before 
crossing the street, or not to talk to strangers, with more and more children 
every year going on the Internet, there's a new set of precautions.</p> 
<p>Just as they need to be taught about physical safety in the real world, we 
need to teach them to be safer in the online world.</p> 
<p>&quot;If someone indicates online that they want to meet you,&quot; 
Capistrant said, &quot;ask yourself 'why'?, and 'what could you do for the 
person asking for the meeting?&quot;</p> 
<p>You should feel threatened, he said, &quot;and you should let someone know 
if the advance is made ... your teacher, your parent or us, the police.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Both he and Keshet noted that among the many online threats to children, 
i.e., exposure to pornography, harassment, and cyber stalking, there is a more 
dangerous threat - cyber grooming.</p> 
<p>It has nothing to do with prettying yourself up.</p> 
<p>It is the process of gaining trust and building false relationships that 
predators use to entice young victims.</p> 
<p>Those predators &quot;groom&quot; their victims by:</p> 
<p>- meeting them in chat rooms and progressing to instant messaging, or 
e-mail, telephone and ultimately direct contact;</p> 
<p>- befriending/isolating victims by building their trust;</p> 
<p>- asking the victim to keep their &quot;friendship&quot; secret, sometimes 
threatening violence; and</p> 
<p>- sending pornographic images to lower inhibitions, provide instruction and 
arouse potential victims.</p> 
<p>The discussion leaders said parents should be aware of the possibility 
their child is being &quot;groomed&quot; if he or she:</p> 
<p>- spends excessive time on the Internet, especially late at night; </p> 
<p>- is secretive about cyber friends, or how they spend their time on the 
Internet; and</p> 
<p>- withdraws from family and friends, seems depressed or unresponsive.</p> 
<p>They note parents/guardians need to develop &quot;rules of the road&quot; 
for children's computer use, perhaps keeping the terminal in a public area and 
not in the child's room; spending time with children while they are on line and 
encouraging the children to inform them about disturbing online encounters.</p> 
<p>Don't be embarrassed to report a possible problem.</p> 
<p>Don't give clues, they repeatedly told the children, as to who you are. 
Simple numbers often are keys to predator success, numbers like 2012 on a 
school jacket, indicating that's the year you'll graduate and thus giving the 
predator instant knowledge of your current age. It's a common thing to exchange 
such data with a friend in describing the new jacket, but it gives the watching 
predator more information about you as an individual.</p> 
<p>&quot;The predator monitoring a chat room,&quot; Capistrant said, 
&quot;sees the things you and your friends say to each other and can use them 
as means of assessing your situation and whether you are a good target. There 
is no safe wall to block information you don't realize you're dispensing.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&quot;Your computer use becomes your link to danger,&quot; he said. 
&quot;It is our job, and your teachers and your family's to protect you and you 
can help us by being careful of what you record on that screen. If you and your 
friend can see it, so can the predator.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;If someone interrupts or follows up one of your chat room visits with 
a request to meet you,&quot; he said, &quot;call us or tell your parent and 
have them call us. We'll control the meeting.&quot;</p> 
<p>Such meetings, he said, are the predator's signature - having successfully 
identified you.</p> 
<p>&quot;If you have told no one and you disappear, we will have no physical 
clues but, in time, might be able to trace the same chat room data he did to 
get a key to his identity.&quot;</p> 
<p>That is not to say that all predators are male, but nationwide statistics 
show the biggest percentage are.</p> 
<p>The children involved in the program had some common-sense questions.</p> 
<p>&quot;What if a predator ends up luring another predator? Who gets 
arrested? Who is wrong?&quot;</p> 
<p>Both, but both probably are already aware of the possible mistake and are 
watching at an assigned meeting site for who they think you are and for others 
who might be watching them. &quot;They normally won't blow their cover,&quot; 
Capistrant said, &quot;because they'll want to strike again.&quot;</p> 
<p>Don't fall, he warned, &quot;for promises of money, gifts, trips to exotic 
places or things 'you can give your mom to improve strained relations.'&quot;
</p> 
<p>There have been no reported instances of predator contact here so far, 
Capistrant said in answer to another query, &quot;but we believe it will come. 
We want you to be prepared for such encounters and to know what to do if it 
happens.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;What about talking boards with buddies on a skateboard site?&quot; 
another student asked.</p> 
<p>Keshet replied, &quot;Again, you don't know who's watching. It's called 
lurking. The predator will seek clues like the kind of board, references to 
'new wheels,' favorite colors or reference to a favorite place to use the board.
</p> 
<p>&quot;What seems to be a restricted conversation between you and your 
skateboarding buddy,&quot; Keshet said, &quot;is anything but private.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be suspicious, be aware, be ready to tell someone in charge if you 
feel threatened,&quot; Capistrant urged the preteens.</p> 
<p>Keshet said the goal of the iSafe program is to educate every student with 
curriculum that is designed to:</p> 
<p>- empower students to recognize techniques used by predators to deceive 
them;</p> 
<p>- empower students to refuse requests for personal information; </p> 
<p>- provide students with the tools they need to respond assertively; and</p> 
<p>- encourage students to report suspicious or dangerous contact immediately.
</p> 
<p>And, Capistrant added, to stay alive and safe because you knew what to do.

<p><b>Stagecoach travel linked Pagosa to early rail routes</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>We've been talking about events leading to the 1916 opening of Wolf Creek 
Pass. In the process, we've discussed routes used to enter Pagosa Country prior 
to opening Wolf Creek.</p> 
<p>After all, transportation has always been important to the development of 
an area. Reasonable routes had to be available for people to enter and leave. 
Routes and means had to be available for bringing supplies into an area and for 
shipping out the products produced in the area.</p> 
<p>As we mentioned in an earlier column, the discovery of gold and other 
minerals was probably the single most important factor leading to settlement of 
the San Juans. Producers of ores needed routes and means for getting their 
materials to market.</p> 
<p>Gen. William Palmer provided the answer. Palmer put in place narrow gauge 
railroad tracks connecting Denver with the San Juan mining district. Palmer's 
narrow gauge reached what today is known as Durango in 1881.</p> 
<p>At the time, there was no Durango. An older community, known as Animas 
City, straddled the Animas River north of today's Durango, roughly north of 
today's Mercy Hospital. When the folks living in Animas City asked Palmer to 
pay for land for railroad facilities, Palmer thought the asking price too high. 
He purchased land south of the existing city, subdivided and sold lots, and 
built his railroad facilities there. The community became known as Durango. 
Animas City eventually withered, its remains absorbed by Durango.</p> 
<p>Palmer's railroad did not stop at Durango, but continued on to Silverton. 
Durango had no silver or other metal-bearing ores. It did have some coal 
deposits. Consequently, smelters constructed at Durango concentrated much of 
the ore production from the Silverton area. Durango became known to many as the 
Smelter City.</p> 
<p>And so, Palmer's railroad carried passengers in and out of the San Juan 
region including Pagosa Country, carried supplies into the San Juan Basin, and 
carried the region's surplus goods across the mountains to markets.</p> 
<p>The railroad was probably built primarily to haul out ores produced in the 
region. A second major industry soon followed -- logging. By the time Palmer's 
trains were chugging across Cumbres Pass and that section of New Mexico, a man 
named Biggs and others had already been cutting into the vast stand of 
Ponderosa pines that stretched across portions of northern New Mexico and 
southern Colorado. That cutting accelerated with the coming of the railroad and 
it was the existence of the giant pines that led to completion of a railroad 
line to Pagosa Springs in 1900.</p> 
<p>The railroad's coming changed the dynamics of transportation connecting the 
San Juan Basin with the outside world and also within the Basin.</p> 
<p>A recapitulation of transportation lines into Pagosa Springs prior to the 
opening of Wolf Creek Pass might be in order at this point. Prior to 1880-1881, 
entrance and egress for Pagosa Country was accomplished by horse and wagons, ox 
teams, or by foot. The route into Pagosa Springs was either via Elwood Pass or 
from the south on a route approximating today's U.S. 84. Users of the Cumbres 
Pass route entered Pagosa Springs from the south on the same U.S. 84 approach. 
At this time, I don't believe any stagecoaches entered the San Juan Basin from 
the outside.</p> 
<p>The Denver &amp; Rio Grande crossed Cumbres Pass in 1880 and reached 
Durango in 1881. As soon as the railroad crossed Cumbres, two stagecoach lines 
connected the railroad terminus with the Durango area, passing through Pagosa 
Springs enroute. That stagecoach travel ceased as soon as the railroad reached 
Durango. Obviously it wasn't needed.</p> 
<p>No railroad reached Pagosa Springs until 1900. Consequently, a stage 
connection between the railroad and Pagosa Springs was maintained. From 1881 
until about 1895, that stagecoach route led from Amargo to Pagosa Springs by 
what became later known as Edith. After Biggs and others launched Lumberton ca. 
1895 beginning the demise of Amargo, the stage route led from Lumberton through 
the same Edith crossing of the Navajo River to Pagosa Springs. During this same 
time, there was wagon traffic in and out of Pagosa Springs via Elwood Pass, 
Cumbres Pass, and the old wagon road to Durango, a route which approximated 
current U.S. 160.</p> 
<p>I believe a major portion of people traffic and freight in and out of the 
Basin at this time was accomplished via the railroad, especially during winter 
when mud and snow pretty much stopped other forms of travel.</p> 
<p>But, winds of change were blowing across the United States. Auto and truck 
traffic was supplanting the railroads. The need for a Wolf Creek Pass was 
pressing. More next week on the construction of Wolf Creek Pass.</p>

<p><b>Drought upgraded, more snow possible by weekend </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Country is moving up the charts.</p> 
<p>Regional drought classifications issued this week by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture indicate Archuleta County now qualifies as &quot;abnormally 
dry,&quot; an upgrade from the former label of &quot;in moderate drought.&quot;
</p> 
<p>An abundance of early and midwinter snowfall plus additional snow totals 
ranging from 10-12 inches during the past week apparently were enough to 
trigger the change in classification.</p> 
<p>And according to the latest forecasts provided by the National Weather 
Service office in Grand Junction, after an expected lull in wet weather today 
and tomorrow, further drought relief may arrive this weekend.</p> 
<p>The forecasts for today and Friday call for mostly-sunny skies, daytime 
highs ranging from 35-45 degrees and nighttime lows anywhere from 5-15.</p> 
<p>Saturday and Sunday are expected to bring a 30-percent chance for snow 
showers, highs in the upper 30s and lows ranging from the single digits to 
upper teens.</p> 
<p>A return to partly-cloudy skies is predicted for Monday and Tuesday, along 
with highs in the mid-30s to mid-40s and lows in the teens.</p> 
<p>Wednesday's forecast indicates a mix of sun and clouds, highs in the 40s 
and lows in the teens.</p> 
<p>The average high temperature last week in Pagosa Springs was 38 degrees. 
The average low was 19. Moisture totals for the week amounted to just over one 
inch.</p> 
<p>Wolf Creek Ski Area reports a summit depth of 148 inches, a midway depth of 
136 inches and year-to-date total snowfall of 290 inches.</p> 
<p>For updates on snow and road conditions at the ski area, visit the Web at 
www.wolfcreekski.com.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Avalanche Information Center reports the current avalanche 
danger in the southern San Juan Mountains ranges from &quot;moderate&quot; to 
&quot;considerable.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to SNOTEL data, the snowpack level for the Upper San Juan Basin, 
as of Wednesday, was 179 percent of average.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow through town ranged from a low of about 90 cubic feet 
per second to a high of approximately 155 cubic feet per second last week.</p> 
<p>The river's historic median flow for the week of Jan. 27 is roughly 55 
cubic feet per second.</p>
