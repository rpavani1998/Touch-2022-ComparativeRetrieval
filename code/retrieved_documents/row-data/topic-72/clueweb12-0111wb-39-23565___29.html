<h1>2011 Trends: What The Housewares Show Foretells For Food Processing</h1> 
<h2>The Housewares show is only tangential to the food &amp; beverage 
processing industry, but it's where you first see food trends that impact the 
foods you make. Our News and Trends editor reports on the newest trends for 
2011.</h2>

<p>&quot;Housewares,&quot; sponsored by the International Housewares Assn 
(IHA), is one of my favorite shows. Although only tangential to the food &amp; 
beverage processing industry, it's here you first see food trends like 
microwave ovens, crock pots and single-serve coffee machines, which of course 
do impact the foods you make.</p> 
<h5>Honeysuckle: The Official Color of 2011</h5> Although green (and/or 
sustainability) was the word I heard most often at the recent International 
Home &amp; Housewares Show, honeysuckle is the official color of 2011.<br>
<br>

 According to Leatrice Eiseman, guru of color and executive director of the 
Pantone Color Institute, honeysuckle, a dynamic reddish pink, is uplifting, 
elevates our psyche beyond escape and instills confidence, courage and spirit 
to meet the exhaustive challenges that have become part of everyday life. 
<p>Sold-out for the first time in three years, the show rang up a 5 percent 
increase in total buyer attendance (21,000), with 1,951 exhibitors (also up 5 
percent from last year) It's the place to be for trend watching because 
housewares manufacturers respond so quickly to consumer demand.</p> 
<p>Another sign of optimism is that men's underwear sales are on an upswing 
(apparently, men stop buying it during a recession), kidded NPD's Peter 
Goldman. On a more serious note, he points out cookware and kitchen electrics 
are benefiting from the do-it-yourself-at-home trend, also influenced by 
cooking programs on TV.</p> 
<p>&quot;This has helped to create a growing generation of what we call 
aspirational chefs,&quot; he says.</p> 
<p>Nesting at home continues to be the most important lifestyle trend as 
consumers continue to watch their pocketbooks. But they are finally replacing 
basic kitchen tools and pans with very colorful products offering 
multi-functional benefits that help consumers cook up healthier foods with less 
effort.</p> 
<p>Competition with Starbucks as a destination is fierce, and the coffee 
connection has moved to the home in a big way as the pod people take over. In 
fact, there was even a Coffeestack from YouCopia Products Inc. to organize 40 
pods (or K cups). Iced coffee was notable, too.</p> 
<p>Saving space is top of mind, so mini-everything and single serve was a hot 
trend. So were sustainable/recyclable/energy-efficient products and materials, 
along with a panoply of outdoor and indoor grills, a resurgence of cast iron, 
energy-saving induction cook tops for the table and gadgets made of silicone. 
Panini makers were everywhere, as were fizzy beverage systems.</p> 
<p>If I was a manufacturer of bottled water, I'd be worried. Consumers are 
turning to reuseable beverage containers. Lifetime Brands' Stackable Water 
Bottle, made of Eastman Tritan, incorporates an expanding lid system that locks 
the lid into the bottle creating an airtight seal. Cool Gear's EZ Freeze Pure 
Filtration includes a patented freezer stick (keeping the water cold) and 
filter system to reduce the chlorine taste and odor of tap water.</p> 
<p>Lots of anniversaries were celebrated this year. Homer Laughlin China, 
maker of Fiesta dishes and the last major china manufacturer in the U.S., has 
been making china for 140 years. Its Fiesta brand also celebrated its 75 
anniversary with the release of a limited edition plate and soup tureen in 
Marigold. We were treated to a custom cake created by Charm City Cakes, of 
&quot;Ace of Cakes&quot; fame&hellip; Regal Ware commemorated its 100th year 
with limited edition sets of American Kitchen Tri-Ply fry pans&hellip; Also 
celebrating their 100th birthdays were West Bend and Tramontina&hellip; It's 
been 90 years of success at the Vita-Mix Corp&hellip; Nordic Ware unveiled its 
Anniversary Bundt-lette Pan, celebrating 65 years.</p> 
<p>DuPont celebrated 50 years of Teflon nonstick coating systems for cookware. 
Invented accidentally by Ray Plunkett, Teflon was kept secret during World War 
II. We had an opportunity to view fabulous prototype pans with vibrant colored 
Teflon interiors (my favorite is purple)&hellip; And All-Clad showcased its 
40th anniversary with limited-edition cookware that features the company's 
anniversary logo.</p> 
<p>&quot;As consumers stop equating personal happiness with the consumption 
and purchase of material possessions, we need to recognize what the 
game-changing strategies for survival and success are,&quot; says IHA's 
consumer trend analyst Tom Mirabile, senior vice president, Global Trend and 
Design, Lifetime Brands Inc.</p> 
<h5>Ten new rules for a changing economy</h5> 
<ol> 
<li>Age is a number, not a lifestyle predictor.</li> 
<li>Economic recovery will be slow, so success will come from taking market 
share from both competitors and non-competitors.</li> 
<li>Inspire &quot;shopping and purchasing&quot; versus &quot;sharing and 
trading&quot;</li> 
<li>Transparency is no longer an option, so manage your image like your manage 
your inventory.</li> 
<li>Create and enable family time, wellness and shared experiences in the home.
</li> 
<li>Storage and space are a renewed concern in the American household.</li> 
<li>Put some fun back in function. Color and shape define style.</li> 
<li>Less glam and more classic styling with long-term appeal.</li> 
<li>Take &quot;comfort food&quot; and &quot;creature comforts&quot; to the 
next level.</li> 
<li>Technology increasingly changes how we shop, so don't get left 
behind.Explore partnerships.</li> </ol> 
<h3>Favorite Finds From the 2011 Housewares Show</h3> 
<p><strong>Mini momentum </strong><br>
Nespresso USA Inc. debuted the <strong>
Pixie</strong>, which takes up less time, space and energy consumption while 
still creating a perfect cup of coffee, both espresso and Lungo. The smallest 
machine ever created by Nespresso, its anodized aluminum side panels were 
inspired by industrial, minimalist design. And, it comes in six bold and 
vibrant colors.www.nespresso.com</p> 
<p>Hearthware Home Products launches its <strong>NuWare Mini Infrared Oven
</strong> (it even has a handle), designed to address the space limitations of 
dorms, offices, apartments and boats. No preheating is necessary, and you can 
broil, roast, grill, steam, fry, dehydrate and bake in it.www.hearthware.com</p>
<p>Fagor America Inc. offers a line of <strong>Mini Dutch Oven cookware
</strong> under the Michelle B label (Chef Michelle Bernstein). Each 4-piece 
cast iron set (0.25-quart) of minis can be used to make soup, appetizers or 
dessert. The 4-piece Mini Dutch Oven set is crafted with multi-coated exterior 
coating to ensure strength. The interior coating of the cookware requires no 
additional seasoning like other cast iron pieces and provides a resilient 
non-stick surface that makes for easier clean up, and the enameled base is 
compatible with all cooktops especially induction surfaces.www.fagoramerica.com
<br><br>
Eades Appliance Technology introduced the <strong>SouVide Supreme Demi
</strong>. The sou vjde technique involves vacuum-sealing food in airtight 
pouches, then simmering the pouches in a low-temperature water bath with a 
precisely maintained temperature throughout (typically between 140 and 190 
degrees) the cooking time to lock in nutrients. With a countertop footprint the 
size of a Crock-Pot, the all-in-one Demi uses the same type of PID-controlled 
heating element contained in the larger version. It can cook 12 4-oz portions.
www.souvidesupreme.com</p> 
<p>A new collection of <strong>Lodge Iron Minis</strong> offers seven cute 
shapes. Curved handles are a nice touch and the Minis are perfect for serving 
up sides, desserts and snacks. Home cooks are making smaller entrees and serve 
side dishes for family meals or when entertaining, so the hot and cold 
retention and classic style of Lodge Cast Iron create great food presentations.

<br>
<strong>Multi-functional finds</strong><br>

Cuisinart's<strong>Blend and Cook Soup Maker</strong>, which both prepares and 
cooks soup, has an internal heater to keep the soup at the optimal temperature; 
Coffee Plus 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker with Hot Water System (it has a 
completely separate 56-oz water reservoir to let you simultaneously dispense 
coffee and hot water for tea at the same time).www.cuisinart.com<br>
<br>

Lightweight and easy to use, the<strong>West Bend Electric Versatility Slow 
Cooker</strong> is a true one-pot-meal-maker. Use the nonstick, dishwasher-safe 
cooking pot to braise meat right on the stovetop and return it to the heating 
base for slow cooking. The base also doubles as a light-duty griddle.
www.focuselectrics.com<br>
<br>
Baby Chef's <strong>Ultimate Baby Food Center
</strong> blends, chops, warms, steams, purees and reheats food for baby. Two 
side-by-side containers (BPA-free) allow you to puree and steam at the same 
time. It takes up very little space on the counter, and also functions as a 
baby bottle warmer.www.kidsline.com<br>
<br>
Toasters aren't just for toast 
anymore. Uniting all the features consumers want most in a toaster, the<strong>
Waring Pro Professional 2-and 4-Slice Cool-Touch Toasters</strong>can prepare 
frozen waffles, pancakes, French toast, frozen bagels, English muffins, and 
yes, toast.www.waringpro.com</p> 
<p>DeLonghi is betting on the popularity of paninis. Its <strong>convection 
oven</strong> has a lever on the front that lowers a metal press inside the 
oven to make the perfect panini sandwich. If you remove a few shelves and 
racks, the oven can also cook a 12-inch pizza.www.shopdelonghi.com</p> 
<h5>Trends in the consumer marketplace</h5> The Multigenerational Home, 
Anti-Consumerism, as Culinary Rebirth, the Multi-Faceted Meaning of Value and 
Reinventing Customer Relationships are the most important trends at work in the 
consumer marketplace of the future, according to a panel of experts 
&ndash;&ndash; Susan Yashinsky, macro trend forecaster, Sphere Trending; 
Michelle Lamb, co-founder, chairman and editorial director, The Trend Curve; 
and Robin Albing, founder and president, Albing International Marketing LLC -- 
led by master trendmeister Tom Mirabile, senior vice president, Global Trend 
and Design, Lifetime Brands Inc.<br>
<br>
<strong>Multigenerational Home 
</strong>consists of Gen Y (ages 16-35) who are renting instead of owning a 
home, job hop frequently, are strongly peer influenced, and they are the least 
affected by brands. Very technologically oriented, they often carry a large 
amount of debt and are adopting new norms on marriage and children. &quot;They 
demand to be seen as individuals but depend on each other to create a massive 
opinion on power of the crowd.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gen X</strong> (ages 36-45) 
consists of families who are &quot;overwhelmed and underwater,&quot; says 
Mirabile, often raising children, and who have a much stronger work life 
balance. &quot;Yet many are still stuck in starter homes, and were hit hardest 
by the recession with mounting debt,&quot; says Mirabile.<br>
<br>
<strong>Baby 
Boomers</strong>(ages 45-65) are the &quot;do-it-for-me generation&quot; who 
are downsizing, shifting priorities from work to real life and entering a 
second middle age. They are inspired by well ness and giving back to the 
community. &quot;They are enjoying a level of health and intelligence their 
parents did not have,&quot; says Mirabile. &quot;They are worried about 
retirement and healthcare costs, may be supporting children and aging 
parents.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yashinsky noted that for all three groups there is a 
lack of trust in institutions and instead there's a trust in their community. 
They are buying less and looking for more meaning in what they buy.<br>
<br>

<strong>Anti Consumerism</strong> is a social political movement, consisting of 
people (primarily Gen Y) who want to create overall happiness by promoting 
simplicity and to save the planet from collapse by slowing down consumption.<br>
<br> <strong>Culinary Rebirth</strong> is good news because it means that 
kitchens will continue to be eating and meeting spaces. &quot;Mass media has 
made a more educated consumer in the kitchen than ever before. So there is an 
opportunity to bring new culinary experiences into the kitchen, all which 
require new cooking appliances, prep tools and recipe books,&quot; says 
Mirabile. &quot;So address the new social aspect, entice your consumer and help 
them be creative and help them update traditional favorites. Bring more 
restaurant experiences into the home, whether it's coffee or Indian cuisine, 
and save them time and space and energy and effort&quot;<br>
<br>
The 
multi-faceted<strong>Meaning of Value. </strong>The reality is that the 
consumer has moved from value equals price plus quality to a multi-dimensional 
meaning, Mirabile noted. For example, 31 million households in the U.S. are a 
one-person household. &quot;Be best of class regardless of the price point you 
operate in,&quot; he suggests.<br>
<br>
<strong>Reinventing Customer 
Relationships</strong> is about technology and understanding that it's a game 
changer, Mirabile said. &quot;We need to embrace multi channel strategies, such 
as the Internet (projected to be a $250 billion business), where almost half of 
retail sales are affected, either as research of point of sale.&quot; 
<p>And for home bakers, what could be better than the <strong>Mastrad Pastry 
Bag Set with Stand</strong>. The silicone bag set, ideal for icing, decorating, 
filling pastries, or creating hors d'oeuvres and appetizers. It's a piece of 
cake to use, a tip cap keeps the bag's contents moist between uses, and easy to 
clean bags can be washed by hand or in the top of the dishwasher).www.mastrad.us
</p> 
<p><strong>Environmentally-friendly</strong><br>
Chef Cat Cora demonstrated 
Cat Cora<strong>Starfrit Alternative Cookware</strong>. Made of 99 percent 
recycled aluminum steel, the line is environmentally friendly, ceramic-surfaced 
to retain heat longer, and non-stick. The handles are attached by rivets, which 
will never loosen and allows the pans to be placed in an oven set at any 
temperature. You can even broil in them. The stay-cool handle is constructed 
from cast stainless steel with a silicone grip. But the Cat Cora pi&egrave;ce 
de r&eacute;sistance is the<strong>Cook'n' Serve 2.5 quart casserole</strong>, 
an 18/10 recycled stainless steel pot, which after cooking, is placed in a 
sustainable bamboo centerpiece, keeping the food longer and allowing you to 
serve from it at table.www.catcora.com</p> 
<p>M.E. Heuck went carbon neutral (certified by First Carbon Solutions and the 
Carbon Neutral Co.) with its<strong>Zeroca line of cookware and kitchen gadgets
</strong>. Made of 100 percent recycled steel and farm-managed bamboo the line 
has a carbon footprint of net zero.www.heuck.com</p> 
<p>Traditional non-stick fry pans containing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 
are manufactured with Perflueoroctoanoic acid (PFOA) and are limited in heat 
resistance &ndash; only up to 500-degrees F without damaging the product as 
well as hurting your health. Made in Belgium,<strong>GreenPan</strong> is the 
first cookware company to create PTFE-free and PFOA-free non-stick products, 
truly transforming the entire cookware market. Thanks to the excellent heat 
capturing ability of Thermolon (a green non-stick coating technology that uses 
60 percent less CO2 emission), less power is needed to reach high temperatures 
and cooking with it requires less energy. In addition to its healthier 
attributes, GreenPan reduces packaging material, printing ink and printing 
colors, and just about all raw materials used in production are recycled. I had 
an opportunity to cook using a Copenhagen pan, which has an oven safe stainless 
steal handle. It was fabulous to use and incredibly easy to clean. The company 
has a variety of styles and colors including a Cast Iron Collection (100% 
recycled post-consumer cast iron made 100% in the USA).www.green-pan.com</p> 
<p><strong>Grilling masters </strong><br>
Do you dream of Brazilian barbeque? 
Do those skewers of flavorful meat found at popular churrascarias scattered 
around the country have you fiddling with your backyard BBQ in your best effort 
to replicate? No more. High Country Industries Inc. brings the<strong>Grillex 
patented Brazilian barbeque</strong> grill to you. A modern day twist to 
Churrasco (pronounced shoo-RAS-koo), the famed outdoor cooking style that 
creates the mouthwatering flavor, aroma and taste of Brazilian barbeque at 
home, Grillex is a compact smokeless grill that is placed over a gas burner, 
and the food is placed on skewers and in baskets suspended vertically around 
the heat source. A circular diffuser at the base of the Grillex evenly convects 
the heat creating a perfect environment for cooking any variation of meats, 
vegetables, fruits and more, so a full meal for four can be served in just 20 
minutes.www.grillex.com<br>
<br>
Masterbuilt Manufacturing Co. CEO John 
McLemore showcased Masterbuilt's new<strong>Butterball Indoor Electric Turkey 
Fryer XL</strong> (yes, it's safe to use indoors) and can accommodate up to a 
20-lb turkey. The dishwasher safe lid, drain valve and removable porcelain 
coated inner pot makes for easy clean up. Or Masterbuilt's Electric Smokehouse 
w/Remote, with a digital thermostat and remote timer, allows you to simply 
throw in your meat and the smoker does the rest. And McLemore has a great new 
cookbook, Dadgum, That's Good!www.masterbuilt.com</p> 
<p>An update on the original charcoal grill released by Bodum in 1962, the 
<strong>Fyrkat Picnic Charcoal Gril</strong>l features a unique funnel shape 
designed to ensure optimal heat while maintaining complete safety and 
stability. Due to its streamlined shape, the cone-shaped grill offers two 
grilling options: a traditional grill top along with a removable, 
battery-operated rotisserie, housed in the lower chamber. Made of enamel-coated 
steel with chrome-plated steel legs and heat-resistant silicone handles, it 
comes in red, orange, green and black.www.bodum.com</p> 
<p>Partnering with the Viking Range Corp.&lsquo;s Culinary Group, Chef Emeril 
Lagasse's<strong>Emeril Gas Grill</strong>, built from rugged steel components, 
is designed to withstand the elements and provide years of grilling enjoyment. 
Four powerful burners provide up to 48,000 BTUs of searing heat, evenly 
distributed over 589 sq. inches of cooking surface. Seven stainless steel 
flavor generator plates catch drippings to create more smoke and smokier 
flavor, and also channel grease neatly into the removable drip tray for easier 
cleanup. Convenient extras like condiment and paper towel storage, accessory 
tool hooks, and locking rubber wheels combine to take backyard performance to 
the next level.&nbsp;www.emerils.com<br>
<br>
<strong>Healthy is as healthy does
</strong><br>
T-Fal <strong>Actifry </strong>looks like a deep fryer, but just 
add one tablespoon of oil and you can cook most anything &ndash; meat, seafood, 
vegetables, fruits and pasta. This healthier alternative has a paddle that 
mixes the food and a heat pulse system blows the heat around so the food cooks 
evenly. Dishwasher safe, it's easy to use and clean. A recipe book is also 
included.www.tefal.com</p> 
<p>Mastrad debuted its new 11-inch round silicone <strong>Chip Maker</strong>. 
Slice potatoes, place them in a single layer, put the chip holder device in the 
microwave and -- without oil -- you end up with crispy, fat-free healthy potato 
(or any kind of vegetable) chips.www.mastrad.us</p> 
<p><strong>Healthy Steps</strong> by Jokari features portion control kitchen 
tools that simplify serving sizes. Healthy Steps Pasta Server helps scoop up 
cooked pasta more easily. The server indicates the proper serving sizes of both 
pasta and sauce -- one scoop gets it right every time. Nut Bowl and Scoop make 
it easy to enjoy nuts in portion-controlled servings. The bowl's lid scoops 
nuts from bulk packaging into the nut bowl. The bowl measures one or two 
servings -- just right for a healthy snack. And Healthy Steps Salad Dressing 
Lid screws onto the top of most salad dressing bottles. Squeezing the bottle 
fills a chamber on top of the lid with a two-tablespoon serving -- the perfect 
portion to top off a healthy salad.www.myhealthysteps.com<br>
<br>
<strong>
Family fun</strong><br>
Make your own ice cream flavors with Hamilton Beach 
<strong>Ice Cream Maker</strong>. Put the bowl in the freezer for a few hours. 
Meanwhile, mix together fresh ingredients, and add to the cold freezer bowl. 
Turn on the machine for about six minutes and you have personalized ice cream 
flavors.www.hamiltonbeach.com</p> 
<p>In the mid-1970s West Bend introduced the original Stir Crazy electric corn 
popper. Today Americans consume about 17 billion quarts of popcorn each year. 
West Bend corn poppers satisfy this appetite by making popcorn an inexpensive 
wholesome treat that's easy to pop and fun to eat. The 6-quart<strong>Stir 
Crazy Deluxe Corn Popper</strong> has a non-stick coated heating plate and is 
now removable for easy cleaning, and the new stir rod pops at higher volume for 
more popcorn. Heat resistant handles make it safer and it contains a butter 
well. Just pop and serve your buttered popcorn and enjoy the movie.

<br>
<strong>Fizzy water</strong><br>
iSi <strong>Twist 
&lsquo;n Sparkle</strong>, a beverage carbonating system gives a new twist on 
home carbonation -- designed to fizz up boundless beverages, by adding shimmer 
and effervescence to any drink.www.isinorthamerica.com<br>
<br>
SodaStream 
unveiled the<strong>Fizz</strong> to its home soda portfolio. A patented Fizz 
Chip displays the amount of CO2 in the carbonator (which powers the home soda 
maker) and shows whether the fizz is light, medium or strong. You can add 
flavors or carbonate water or soda.www.sodastreamusa.com<br>
<br>
<strong>Easy 
does it</strong><br>
From World Kitchen, <strong>Pyrex No-Leak-Lids</strong> 
products feature a functional and contemporary design that will not absorb 
stains or odors, are BPA-free, leak-proof and the airtight plastic lids have a 
vent for microwaving quickly and easily &ndash; great idea. Available in both 
round and rectangle shapes they conveniently nest and stack. Your microware 
will thank them.www.worldkitchen.com<br>
<br>
DKB Household USA has partnered 
with Jamie Oliver for a line of kitchen tools and gadgets. His<strong>Tilt 
&amp; Mix Bowls</strong> (set of three) are constructed of stainless steel with 
slip-resistant rubber on the bottom of each bowl. You tilt the bowl and the 
flat spot on the base allows for whisking or mixing at a 45-degree angle.
www.jamie-olivers-kitchen-kit.com</p> 
<p>Great coffee starts with fresh ground beans. With this concept in mind, 
Philips Saeco developed its<strong>Coffeemaker with Built-In Grinder</strong>. 
The adjustable, conical burr grinder offers the flexibility to brew coffee to 
your exact preference, while the innovative anti-clogging technology provides 
hassle-free maintenance. External venting reduces humidity within the machine 
and prevents clogging of coffee grounds, while the grinder chute is easily 
accessed through a lockable, clear plastic cover on the top of the unit, making 
it easy to see when cleaning is necessary.www.saeco-usa.com</p> 
<p>Obol's <strong>Swoop n Scoop</strong> is the first product that solves the 
frustrating problem of soggy cereal. The one-piece, dishwasher safe spiral 
slide design keeps cereal crispy until mixed by the user. And its patented 
thumb-shelf makes it easy to hold while watching TV or eating in bed.www.obol.co
</p> 
<p>Salad makers take up unnecessary space, so PMI Aladdin created a BPA-free, 
dishwasher -safe<strong>Collapsible Salad Set</strong> with containers to keep 
the ingredients separate and a dual- action colander. www.aladdin-pmi.com 
Progressive 4-quart Collapsible Produce Keeper allows you to wash and store 
produce in a single container containing a water reservoir to keep it fresh and 
a vent for airflow.www.progressiveintl.com</p> 
<p>For Fido, Simple Human's <strong>Pet Food Can</strong> with wheels stores 
food, and an ergonomic lock-tight handle keeps it fresh. A scoop attaches for 
easy access, and the inner bucket is removable.www.simplehuman.com<br>
<br>

<strong>Gadgets galore </strong><br>
Fitting comfortably in the palm of your 
hand, the<strong>Farberware Container Peeler</strong> from Lifetime Brands 
makes peeling vegetables mess-free and eliminates the need to peel vegetables 
directly over a trash can, cutting board or bowl. The peels go directly into 
the container as you cut; so simply open the container when done to dispose of 
the peels.www.Lifetimebrands.com<br>
<br>
Ideal for outdoor picnics, Component 
Design Northwest (CDN) introduced the<strong>Infrared Gun</strong>. Just point 
it at the food, press the trigger, and within a second, it provides an accurate 
surface temperature reading ensuring food safety. It uses two AAA batteries, is 
made of ABS plastic and comes in bright Construction Yellow with black accents.
www.cdn-timeandtemp.com<br>
<br>
<strong>Zoku Tools </strong>by Zoku LLC allow 
you to make unique pops. Just pour in the juice, and make flavored core pops 
such as creamsicles, apply fruit slices and stenciled cutouts and you can make 
pops with cool angles &ndash; geometry was never so much fun. The kit includes 
three drip-free Zoku cups, one heart and one star stencil, one fruit wand, one 
siphon and one angle tray.www.zokuhome.com</p> 
<p>Zyliss <strong>Smart Guard Gourmet Mandoline</strong> with technology that 
keeps blades protected and away from the hand by covering the blade (or blade 
insert) until actively exposing the German-made stainless steel V-blades by the 
user, who must press and hold a squeeze handle to activate and allow slicing. 
Basters can be messy, but the dishwasher safe Zyliss Squeezy Baster flexible 
silicone body holds, and then releases juices with a squeeze-and-release valve 
that evenly distribute the juices. The bristles are also made of silicone and 
can withstand high temperatures. Zyliss StrongBoy Nutcracker lets you crack 
nuts using one handed lever action and it works beautifully.www.zylissusa.com
</p> 
<p>Oxo's <strong>Container Grater</strong> is ideal if you want to measure 
what you are grating and dispense as needed. Bi-directional sharp stainless 
steel grating surface is ideal for medium grating of hard cheeses, chocolate, 
carrots, zucchini and more.www.oxo.com</p> 
<p>For those of you with a Kitchenaid Stand Mixer, you will be happy to hear

Cuisipro presented <strong>Snap-Fit Pop 
Molds</strong> that make it easy to create frozen pops. The molds snap together 
to pop into the freezer, to serve and to snore. Wood sticks are not needed 
since the sticks are integrated into the design of a sailboat, robot and 
rocket. Kids can create any flavor using candied citrus peels or chunks of 
fruits or can layer in yogurt, pudding, ice cream or jelly. Best of all, the 
drip catching handles eliminate sticky messes.www.cuisipro.com<br>

<p><strong>Diamond in the rough </strong><br>
Victorinox Commercial Cutlery 
introduces<strong>Victorinox Ceramic Knives with Fibrox handles</strong>. The 
blades are made from zirconium oxide powder, compressed at high pressures and 
sintered in furnaces at temperatures of more than 2,700 degrees, so the 
hardness of the blade is comparable to that of a diamond.www.swissarmy.com</p> 
<p>As the kitchen emerges as the central hub of the home and both the novice 
cook and expert foodie constantly sharpen their cooking skills, the need for 
functional, stylish and well-designed tools has never been greater! Bodum's 
combination of an extremely hard and sharp ceramic blade with an ergonomic, 
non-slip silicone handle accentuated by a dotted touch pad, creates a<strong>
knife</strong> that stands up to any cutting task while remaining safe and 
comfortable to use. The knives, available in black, red, orange, green and 
off-white handles, in the Bistro collection include a 6&quot; and 7&quot; 
Chef's Knife; a 6&quot; and 7&quot; Bread Knife; a 6.5&quot; Santoku Knife; a 
4.5&quot; Tomato Knife; 3&quot; Paring/Vegetable Knife; a 4&quot; Firm Cheese 
Knife and 3.5&quot; Fresh Cheese Knife. Additionally, the white ceramic blades 
are non-corrosive and neutral in taste, preventing foods from absorbing odors 
or becoming discolored after having been cut. Made of BPA-free plastic with 
silicone feet for keeping it firmly in place, the<strong>Bistro Knife Block
</strong> is so cool. It features an interior made up of a myriad of very fine 
plastic bristles, allowing any knife to sit in any configuration within the 
block &ndash; tightly and securely.www.bodum.com<br>

Chef Guy Fieri, with 
his signature spiked hair and tattoos, hosts three popular shows on the Food 
and is the host of the game show A Minute to Win It on NBC. He has worked with 
Ergo Chef to design<strong>The Knuckle Sandwich Series of Knives</strong>. Made 
of High Carbon German Stainless Steel for stain resistance and durability, they 
have a patented ergonomic design to create an extension of your hand for 
comfort, and the blades are precision heat treated to 56RC to keep a great 
edge. The knife handles feature a wild signature flame-wave handle design, 
accented with a polished star to complete Guy's look and the blades are 
artistically-etched with the &quot;Guy Fieri Knuckle Sandwich&quot; logo as a 
bold expression of Fieri's Hot Rod/Rock &lsquo;n' Roll attitude. His newest 
innovation is The Beast, a 6.5&quot; Meat Cleaver. The handle has a large 
crisscross crusher on the end for pulverizing nuts, and garlic, etc., and a 
star shaped hole in the blade makes for easy hanging, a red edge guard protects 
the knife edge, and it weighs in at a whopping 1 pound. &quot;I designed the 
line on a cocktail napkin,&quot; he told us. Incidentally, Fieri predicts 
&quot;low and slow&quot; BBQ will become more popular than &quot;hot and 
fast&quot; grilling.www.ergochef.com<br>

And speaking of rock and roll, 
Lodge Manufacturing debuted the coolest<strong>cast iron guitar skillet</strong>
 that measures 10.75 inches long by 4.67 inches wide. It would be a perfect 
gift &ndash; hint, hint.www.lodgemfg.com<br>

<strong>New technology
</strong><br>
<strong>Phase Brew 8-cup Coffee Brewer</strong> by Bunn heats and 
holds water until it reaches the perfect temperature &ndash; so it can be 
spray-released, instead of slow-dripped, over coffee grounds to achieve ideal 
flavor extraction. This innovative technology results in a perfect pot of 
coffee with rich flavor and amazing aroma.www.BunnAtHome.com<br>

<strong>
Weird, but notable</strong><br>
<strong>Talking Timerz</strong> talk and 
sometimes sing. Each timer comes with five to six custom one-liners and 
melodies. The user can choose their favorite to play when the timer goes off. 
Characters include a cat (It's burning! And I really don't care), dog, rooster, 
chef, hippie and Buddha baby.www.talkingtimerz.com<br>

Toy designer Joel 
Shrockie presented the clever, patent-pending<strong>Fish Clip</strong>, a 
tight-gripping clip great for keeping bags closed. Its locking jaws keep a 
tight hold on the bag until you press its fin, which is a cleverly disguised 
release button. And when you aren't using it, the magnetic clip will stick to 
your refrigerator.www.shrockie.com</p> 
<p>Quiver Tree International solves the &quot;Is this my glass?&quot; dilemma

metallic markers. The marks wipe off the class with a little cooking oil.
