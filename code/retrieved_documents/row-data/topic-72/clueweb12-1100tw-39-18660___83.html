<p>The &ldquo;Ask the Readers&rdquo; feature has always been popular at Get 
Rich Slowly. It&rsquo;s a great way for people like you to ask questions about 
money, and, best of all, it&rsquo;s a chance to help others solve their 
problems. But there&rsquo;s no doubt that the &ldquo;how much do you 
spend?&rdquo; questions get the most responses.</p> 
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why Kate wrote recently to ask a question that 
hadn&rsquo;t ever occurred to me. She wants to know how much you spend on kids. 
Here&rsquo;s her e-mail:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking about starting a family soon. I realize there are a 
lot of costs when it comes to having and raising a child, from clothes to 
diapers to child care to toys to car seats. I also know that these costs can 
vary greatly, but having never been a parent before, I have no idea what the 
range can be.<b>I&rsquo;d like to hear from readers about how much they spend 
per month on their children.</b> Are we talking an extra $100 a month &mdash; 
or an extra thousand? Under what circumstances? Do the costs go up or down as 
the child grows?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is one of those discussions where I&rsquo;ll have to bow out. I spend 
zero dollars per month on children because, so far, I&rsquo;ve elected not to 
have any. (But isn&rsquo;t that &ldquo;so far&rdquo; kind of interesting?<i>I
</i> think so.)</p> 
<p>So, I leave Kate&rsquo;s question entirely in your hands, readers. How much 
do you spend on your children? Are kids more expensive as newborns or as 
teenagers? How would you advise prospective parents to prepare financially?</p> 
<p> </p>

<p>My son is 3.5 and in full-time daycare. He costs nearly $1,000/mo. We get 
most of his toys and clothing at consignment, he is still in night diapers. 
Most of that cost is his daycare, some of it is food that mainly he eats 
(WAFFLES!), some of it is impulse purchases (the new comb and brush after he 
does a great job getting a haircut). Some of it is the cost of babysitting on 
date night. Some of it is the extra cost of travel (technically he could fly 
free until he was two but has had his own seat since he was about 15 months 
because OH MY mama needs a little room to breathe while being super zen on a 
plane).</p> 
<p>The flip side is we eat out less, we see fewer movies, we are not doing any 
major renovation at the house until he&rsquo;s more mature&hellip; so there is 
some savings there.</p> 
<p>He has gotten a little less expensive over time, but I think 5-7 are going 
to be the golden years (public school and not much after school activity).</p>

<p>$1250/month for daycare, ~75/month medical on average, and ~50/month on 
food for our 1-year old. Hard to estimate the &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; 
costs, maybe another 50.</p> 
<p>We live in a city with one of the higher costs of living. She still shares 
our room so there&rsquo;s no increased housing cost right now.</p> 
<p>But I think the biggest &ldquo;cost&rdquo; &mdash; and joy &mdash; has to 
do with time.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had to spend very little on clothing. So far it has just come 
to us in the form of presents and hand-me-downs. Everybody has extra baby 
clothing. Similarly, toys seem to magically appear in large numbers because 
everybody else has too many too.</p> 
<p>Childcare is expensive. We were paying $8/hr for one-on-one care, 
$690/month for infant daycare, and $590/month for preschool, all in a mostly 
rural area. (A year we spent in an expensive city, we paid $1200/month for 
preschool.) Currently we&rsquo;re paying $8000/year for private school plus 
$45/day for summer camp. But the private school option is optional (we&rsquo;d 
still be paying for preschool if we weren&rsquo;t doing it).</p> 
<p>Disposable diapers are costly, not just from their base price, but also 
from the increased trips to the store if you choose that option. (Perhaps 
ordering online cuts that cost. Diapers.com didn&rsquo;t exist with our first). 
Cloth diapers vary in price as well. Here&rsquo;s Que Sera pondering prices of 
disposable vs. cloth for someone who is considering a diaper service.

<p>The birth of our first child cost almost exactly our additional tax credit 
for that first year. This one should cost something like $90 with the three 
copays I&rsquo;ll have to pay. Not sure why my insurance changed, but it did.
</p> 
<p>Kids can cost more or less depending on the choices you make.</p>

<p>We only have one toddler (while we&rsquo;re trying to have another), so I 
can&rsquo;t speak to school aged kids yet or multiple. That being said, 
there&rsquo;s a lot of start up costs before things settle in. Somethings we 
absolutely bought new, like our carseat and crib (and this we did because of 
safety concerns). Most of our daughter&rsquo;s clothes are used (either bought 
used or is handed down). And some things you see &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; we 
didn&rsquo;t get at all. In the end, we spent about $1000 to get our daughter 
set up, but we also had to spend another $1000 on some medical things that came 
up. Month to month, we spend probably about $200 extra for her upkeep, but half 
of that is her 529 contribution. We never spent much on baby food. We do, 
however, have to spend about $700 on part-time day care, although we&rsquo;re 
on the cheaper end of friends we have on that one. She also benefits by being 
currently the only grandchild on both sides. After here, I don&rsquo;t know but 
my father-in-law keeps telling me the costs go up.</p>

<p>I am going to concentrate on on-going costs. Acquiring the necessary 
equipment can be rather easily calculated.</p> 
<p>Infants: Diapers are an on-going cost, whether it be disposable, diaper 
service or even increased laundry costs. Feeding supplies whether that be pads, 
pumps and Lanolin for the nursing Mom or formula for weaned babies. Maybe 
special detergent for the first few weeks to wash clothes.</p> 
<p>If both parents work: Daycare. Factor in some sort of grocery cost because 
making everything from scratch will be difficult everyday.</p> 
<p>Fast forward.. My sons are 16 and 12. Now my 16 Yo attends a parochial 
school, participates in band and follows a dress code. There are fund raisers, 
retreats and service opportunities (yes we pay). He is given $80 a month for 
his lunches/allowance. We have to provide transportation and school is 13 miles 
from home. Drivers ed, license fees, car insurance&hellip;</p> 
<p>My 12 Yo is in public school, but there was still a materials fee of about 
$80 for the year, plus 6th grade camp ($120), t-shirts for field day, PTO 
carnival, skating parties, lunches, school supplies, transportation costs 
include his bike (recently tuned up for $80), or us driving him the mile in bad 
weather. He plays sports all year around &ndash; Football, basketball, soccer, 
baseball. So team fees, shoes and other personal equipment, entrance fees for 
games (Football and basketball) team parties, team fund raisers, our turn to 
take team snacks&hellip; He also is in band, so outside lessons, instruments;
</p> 
<p>In 2011, For the family of 4 we spent approximately:<br>
 $2568 &ndash; 
Apparel<br>
 $1500 &ndash; Non-tuition education<br>
 $2000 &ndash; Sports and 
music (not counting entrance fees or going out with the team afterwards)<br>
 
$1400 &ndash; braces for the 12 YO &ndash; full payment</p> 
<p>We could go on about bigger car, more food (I have teen boys), bigger 
house, replacing furniture they get careless with, medical and dental 
costs&hellip;</p> 
<p>Now, of course, a lot of this is optional. But it enhances the experience. 
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Is your cost for braces post dental insurance? I&rsquo;ve recently just 
shoppped for braces for another one of our kids and nobody is willing to do 
them in the Philly area for less than 5 grand! And that&rsquo;s a cash price. 
If we&rsquo;d have set up a payment plan or used a credit card, it&rsquo;d be a 
lot more. (We don&rsquo;t have dental insurance).</p>

<p>Just to terrify anyone contemplating children, I would like to point out 
that my brother turns 25 this year and is still living at home. The &pound;250 
rent he pays to my parents gets redistributed to his little sister (me, aged 
22) to make sure she doesn&rsquo;t starve in the big city while she earns her 
degree, so my long suffering ma and pa are in the hole from putting him up.<br>

 I think I once worked out how much I&rsquo;d cost my parents over the years, 
in a vain attempt to see how famous an artist I&rsquo;d have to become to pay 
them back. It was close to half a million pounds. While I&rsquo;ll probably 
never be able to pay them back, I&rsquo;m going to make sure I look after them 
in old age.</p> 
<p>Children are the ultimate STD. You will never get rid of us. Sorry mum and 
dad!</p>

<p><i>I&rsquo;m going to make sure I look after them in old age.</i></p> 
<p>How? You can&rsquo;t even take care of <b>yourself</b>. You just admitted 
that you&rsquo;re 22, and still living off an &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; of 
&pound;250/month. How can you possibly support yourself, a family, and your 
parents on a starving artist&rsquo;s income?</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell if your comment was tongue-in-cheek, but I didn&rsquo;t 
detect even a twinge of guilt in what you&rsquo;re doing to your parents. If I 
were in your shoes, I&rsquo;d feel obligated to do everything in my power to 1) 
get off their teat, and 2) pay them back.</p> 
<p>It sounds like you desperately need a better plan.</p>

<p>How extremely rude and judgemental. I have no idea but Ru is doing, but 
given that she&rsquo;s 22 and earning her degree, I&rsquo;d guess that 
she&rsquo;s in training for some kind of professional career &ndash; many 
professions involve studying and limited earning potential until well into your 
20s. $250 a month is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount she might spend 
studying at a good school in a city area.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m 30 and having studied for my professional qualifications 
I&rsquo;m only now fully financially independent. I could have achieved what I 
have without any support from my parents, but I would have accrued more debt 
(at minimum) and it would have made many things more difficult. I&rsquo;m 
extremely grateful to have parents who were both able and willing to support me 
on my journey: like Ru, I can never pay them back for the financial investment 
in me (or indeed the emotional support) but thanks to their support, I&rsquo;m 
now in a career which will realistically allow me the kind of earnings that 
will enable me to support them in their old age. I had the opportunity to be 
&lsquo;off the teat&rsquo;, as you so dismissively put it, at age 23 but if 
I&rsquo;d stayed in the career I was in then I would have been limiting myself 
to much lower earnings which (among other things) would have made it difficult 
for me to support my family in later years.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s no duty for parents to support children into their adult 
years, but some choose to do so. Those of us who have had the privilege of that 
support are (mostly) extremely grateful for it. I too dream of somehow 
&lsquo;hitting the big time&rsquo; so I can pay everything back and more, but 
like Ru, I know my realistic goal is to succeed professionally so I can support 
my family when they really need me.</p>

<p>I think you overacted to her comment. She&rsquo;s still in school and her 
parents give her some money to help her out, which is pretty common. She 
didn&rsquo;t make any mention of having her own family yet, she just observed 
how much she&rsquo;d cost her parents over the years.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re either confusing Ru with her brother or projecting 
other people&rsquo;s issues on her. She&rsquo;s finishing up her degree, and 
lots of students have help from their parents in university. That&rsquo;s not a 
crime. Unless she plans to stay a student forever, I imagine she&rsquo;s 
planning on getting a job and being financially independent. Since she&rsquo;s 
reading this blog, I&rsquo;m guessing she&rsquo;s probably much smarter about 
money than many people her age.</p> 
<p>She&rsquo;s likely got at least 30 years before she will actually be 
supporting her parents, if indeed that is necessary. She&rsquo;s at the 
beginning of her financial journey, and kudos to her for thinking about 
something that many people&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t worry about until their parents 
are in dire straights.</p>

<p>Dial down the concern, Kevin. Don&rsquo;t let yourself get so worked up so 
early in the morning.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you never had any help at all, you did everything by 
yourself, opened every door that got in your way.</p> 
<p>You know how we&rsquo;re having a bit of a jobs crisis right now? 
That&rsquo;s what you should be concerned about. If you want a productive, 
tax-paying youth to mature and contribute so that our entire society can be 
taken care of in the future, the focus for all of us is how to stop the 
bleeding. Soaring student loan debt and few jobs, even for previously 
considered safe professions like law, are what&rsquo;s going to hurt us most. 
The entire topic of this discussion, babies and how much they cost, won&rsquo;t 
be a concern for an educated and jobless generation &mdash; they just 
won&rsquo;t be able to afford kids at all.</p>

<p>Kevin, you might want to simmer down with the judgment. </p> 
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t detect even a twinge of guilt in what you&rsquo;re 
doing to your parents.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>She isn&rsquo;t doing anything TO her parents. Her parents are choosing to 
distribute their money that way. Last time I checked parents are usually the 
&ldquo;adults&rdquo; in the parent-child relationship (even if both parties are 
legal adults) and have control over the decisions they are making.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d save the judgment for after you know all the facts. She never 
claimed she would be a starving artist (shockingly, there are artists that 
actually make money), and she acknowledged she&rsquo;s still in school. While I 
find it very admirable that some people turn 18 and immediately become 
self-sufficient, that&rsquo;s not how it works for everyone. Some children are 
raised with the expectation that their parents will support them through 
college &ndash; just because she appears to be one of these people does not 
make her a bad person.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel guilty, because I haven&rsquo;t forced them to do 
anything, they can afford it and, most importantly- they planned for it. I do 
feel immensely grateful to my mum and dad though. After 2 years of working in 
an office straight out of school, I was presented an amazing opportunity: a 
place at the best art school in Europe. My parents could see that I 
wasn&rsquo;t happy where I was and they told me to take the opportunity and do 
something for myself instead of someone else. My whole life I&rsquo;d been 
trying to live up to this future they&rsquo;d projected on to me (they wanted a 
scientist or a doctor), and then when I left school I was not only working full 
time but looking after my boyfriend who had severe depression.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this, but design university is not like 
other universities. I&rsquo;m not a history or sociology student, waltzing in 
for 3 hours of lectures a week. Working in the studio is 10 to 6 (or later) 
job, and it doesn&rsquo;t leave much scope for part time work, especially when 
you have no bar or retail experience and the employers in London have a massive 
pool to draw from. I was lucky enough to get some work audio typing, but 
it&rsquo;s very ad-hoc, so I&rsquo;m only making about &pound;90 a month.</p> 
<p>Am I living in a penthouse in Chelsea scoffing down caviar and champagne? 
No, I live in a box room in Camberwell in an ex-council flat I share with 4 
other people. I eat mainly vegetables and rice. I don&rsquo;t go out drinking 
or partying, unless it&rsquo;s a house party. That &pound;250 is half my rent. 
I cover the rest: my travel, school supplies (I&rsquo;m talking bags of 
porcelain here, not a biro), mandatory trips and gallery visits, clothing, 
food, the list goes on and on.</p> 
<p>Also &ldquo;how can you support yourself, a family, and your parents on a 
starving artist&rsquo;s income?&rdquo;<br>
 1- I don&rsquo;t plan to have 
natural children. I may adopt or foster.<br>
 2- My parents do have a pension, 
they&rsquo;re not idiots. And my mum has told me specifically that she would 
like to live with me in old age so I can keep an eye on her.<br>
 3- I&rsquo;m 
not going to be a starving artist, I&rsquo;m going to be a ceramic designer. 
And there&rsquo;s always scope for a full time office job with ceramics on the 
side until I&rsquo;m there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how it works in the UK, but in the U.S., adopting a 
child domestically from the foster care system is free. This is what I plan to 
do if I ever do decide to have children. (Of course, some kids in foster care 
have serious emotional, physical, or cognitive issues, but no child is 
guaranteed to be free of such problems.)</p>

<p>Interesting response, Ru; I share the same sentiment &ndash; 18 is not some 
magic number where the financial obligation ends. Thankfully I have not relied 
on my mother financially since I moved out when I was 20, probably to my own 
detriment no matter how much I tried to muscle it completely on my own. Had I 
stayed home longer, completed a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree (I have an Associates) 
and so on, I would probably be in a much better position now. She would have 
allowed me to stay as long as I needed to, but it was my decision to leave. 
Huge mistake that was.</p>

<p>Like Kris, I&rsquo;ve never wanted children and knew it at a very early

my mother reminded him that I&rsquo;d been saying &ldquo;no raising kids for 
me&rdquo; since I was 10.)I married a man who seemed ok with that idea, but 
turns out he really did want children. This is one of the few deal-breaker

<p>How much you spend can vary a lot, but I will say that definitely the cost 
goes UP as the child grows. Babies don&rsquo;t need that much. They don&rsquo;t 
need a fancy crib (they can sleep pretty much anywhere), they don&rsquo;t need 
a lot of different toys and gizmos, they can eat breast milk and regular 
grownup food that&rsquo;s been mashed up, they can wear hand-me-down clothes 
(because baby clothes only fit for a few weeks or months and then are ready to 
be passed on) and cloth diapers. You can skip many of the things you&rsquo;re 
marketed for a baby and be perfectly fine.</p> 
<p>Older kids eat more and wear out their clothes; far more significantly, 
they want to take gymnastics and music lessons and go to day camps during the 
summer. Maybe they wear glasses or get a lot of cavities. That&rsquo;s the 
stuff that really costs. Obviously, some of those expenditures are optional, 
but if you have enough money available to pay for those amenities and 
educational experiences, it is hard to refuse and decide to save it instead; 
there&rsquo;s the feeling of intentionally depriving your child. And I say this 
as someone whose child almost never asks for &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;&ndash; even if 
you&rsquo;ve managed to raise a non-materialistic child, they can still be 
expensive at school age. My own experience was that I was surprised at how 
cheap babies could be, and then later surprised that one might be expected to 
shell out $300 for a week of science camp.</p>

<p>I agree with you there &mdash; the cost really varies! I don&rsquo;t have

the latest and greatest things for their kids &mdash; all new &mdash; while 
others happily receive hand-me-downs and items on loan. Some people have large

smaller, close knit social circles willing to give away things other people

<p>I live in Brooklyn, NY. Our daycare costs almost $1700/mo per child for 8am 
to 6pm care. And that means that you get to be at work for the bare minimum of 
any regular job&ndash;9ish to 5ish. Also, if you plan on ever going out, the 
rate for a sitter is $12-15/hour for anyone who knows how to change a diaper 
and isn&rsquo;t a felon. Plus the extra seat on the plane. Going to a family 
event in Chicago is twice as expensive as it used to be now that we have two 
kids who need their own seats.<br>
 Clothing/toys is really negligible, since 
there are so many used options, but childcare is really expensive! This is why 
many women quit their jobs&ndash;paying for daycare often takes their entire 
takehome pay or close to it, especially for more than one kid. And kids 
don&rsquo;t start school until kindergarten (pre-k is not guarenteed), so 
you&rsquo;re looking at 5 years of childcare per child. Lotsa money!</p>

<p>The easily quantifiable costs are relatively easy, but highly variable 
situation to situation.</p> 
<p>For instance, our daycare costs are lower than most because my 
mother-in-law watches our kids.</p> 
<p>Another variable is whether your school district has half-day or all-day 
kindergarten. Our older two kids had half-day, while our youngest will have 
full-day as our school district is moving to full-day this fall.</p> 
<p>Besides all the obvious costs, I know that my wife and I spend more on 
vehicles (and by extension gas) than we would without kids. I wouldn&rsquo;t be 
driving a gas guzzling minivan on my 30 minute each way commute if we 
didn&rsquo;t have kids.</p> 
<p>Heck, I might live close enough to bike to work if we didn&rsquo;t have 
kids and wanted to live really close to my in-laws for the babysitting help! 
Others might have a more expensive house because they want to be in a really 
good school district. Most people have a larger house than they would without 
kids.</p> 
<p>Food, clothes, activities, and daycare are the easy things to figure out. 
It&rsquo;s the other things that can get tricky.</p> 
<p>Either way, kids cost a lot of money.</p>

<p>Really? The financial adviser recommends more than $500/mo/kid? My BOE 
calculations said that starting at birth $500/month would be good if we 
didn&rsquo;t expect any financial aid at a private school (and it is too much 
for many publics). It doesn&rsquo;t quite make the full projected tuition at a 
private school, but there&rsquo;s the chance DC will get merit scholarships, 
we&rsquo;ll be living in a state with a good flagship, etc. I don&rsquo;t mind 
having excess money in the first 529, since transferring to kid #2 should be 
easy, but I&rsquo;m not sure that I want to either take a penalty or finance a 
distant relative&rsquo;s education with excess. (Also have no desire for more 
formal education myself.)</p> 
<p>Oh wait, that&rsquo;s $500 for the two kids, not per kid. Ignore me.</p>

<p>I think $500 (even for both kids) is too high. That&rsquo;s about $54k per 
kid WITHOUT compounding interest. And you don&rsquo;t know that one or both 
won&rsquo;t get some kind of scholarship. They should pay for some of the 
expenses too by working while in school. And you will likely be able to cash 
flow some.<br>
 I would lower your contributions to the 529 and make sure that 
you are maxing out your ROTH. Because you can withdraw your ROTH contributions 
to help fund their college tax and penalty free at any time. If they 
don&rsquo;t need it then it will just roll for your retirement.<br>
 If your 
fully funding all your retirement AND doing the $500 per month in the 529 then 
by all means go for it.<br>
 Remember that your retirement ALWAYS comes first 
THEN your kids college.</p>

<p>I have a 16 month old that I budget $100 a month for as far as diapers, 
clothing, and incidentals. I&rsquo;m a stay at home mom now, but previously 
when I was working, his daycare was $500 a month. I recommend calling around 
and seeing if you can find someone who does care from their home, just a few 
kids. It&rsquo;s typically cheaper than a daycare facility and from what 
I&rsquo;ve found, better care. I&rsquo;d also recommend a new car seat, just 
for the safety features/requirements. But other than that, most everything can 
be used &ndash; clothes, crib, books, toys. Even though I only budget $100 a 
month, it&rsquo;s usually less than that now, with the bulk of it being 
diapers. Check out diapers.com for some good diaper deals (not so much on other 
stuff).</p>

<p>By law, at least in my state (CA), all daycare providers have to be 
licensed. And there are many LICENSED home daycare providers in my area. In 
fact I didn&rsquo;t run into any home daycare providers who were not licensed.
</p> 
<p>Home daycare costs about half as much as the large daycare facilities. And 
my interviews of home daycare providers versus the larger facilities showed me

<p>Well, it sounds like you were careful, which is what I was talking about.
</p> 
<p>However, just because the law says all daycare providers must be licensed 
doesn&rsquo;t mean that they all are. There are lots of people picking up money 
on the side by having groups of children stay in their homes while parents 
work. These informal arrangements are usually the ones that end up on the

<p>I can only speak to the cost of animals (specifically: 4 horses, 2 dogs, 2 
cats and a bunch of chickens/ducks), but as essential dependents who require 
the basic necessities of food/shelter/water/love &ndash; they are freaking 
expensive.</p> 
<p>Similar to children (I would imagine), they cost a lot to feed (but at 
least it&rsquo;s a fairly consistent $-amount each month), their anticipated 
medical care (vaccinations) costs a lot, their emergency medical care when one 
gets sick (or breaks his tail) costs a small-fortune, and making sure their 
barn/habitat is kept up is also expensive.</p> 
<p>Bottom line, I think it&rsquo;s a crapshoot. You could end up with a 
baby/child that&rsquo;s perfectly happy, healthy and wise, or you could end up 
with a baby/child who has special needs, requires more attention/money than 
another.</p>

<p>Our daughter is 4 months old. I was really worried about paying for 
everything that comes with a new baby while I was pregnant, but now, I see that 
she doesn&rsquo;t cost much at all. We pay $15/day for a home daycare. She is 
breastfed, so no formula cost (saves $1000-$4000/year plus breastfed babies 
rarely get sick, so no co-pays!). She just started eating food, but we 
don&rsquo;t buy baby food. I just puree whatever fruits and vegetables we 
already have in the house. I started buying diapers on sale from the day I 
found out I was pregnant. If you buy them on sale and use coupons, I would say 
it costs about $25/month for diapers and wipes. We buy all of her clothing and 
baby items on clearance or second hand (other than car seats and cribs). And 
adding her to our health insurance was about $80/month. She costs less than 
$500/month. Kids are as expensive as you make them.</p>

<p>I would say we now spend about $60 a month on diapers, and let&rsquo;s say 
$50 on other variable costs. The big one is $1200 a month on child care &mdash; 
I just went back to work.</p> 
<p>Of course the costs will increase as she starts to be able to 
&ldquo;do&rdquo; more &mdash; but we will embrace those costs. My husband and I 
always knew we wanted to start a family so we don&rsquo;t complain about the 
money. Every day we wonder how we filled the hours of our day before she was 
born! To anyone contemplating having a child &mdash; do it! It has enriched our 
lives so much &mdash; the exhaustion and money is a small price to pay.</p>

<p>For the love of god, please only have children if you are 100% sure 
you&rsquo;re ready and you WANT to make the sacrifices required to be a parent. 
Don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;do it.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not something you can take 
back to the store.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not responding to be a Negative Nelly&hellip; I&rsquo;m 
very happy for every parent that finds joy in it. It&rsquo;s just that so many 
people say &ldquo;just do it&rdquo; when it comes to kids without really 
communicating the difficulties of being a parent. It&rsquo;s not a decision to 
be taken lightly.</p> 
<p>For the record, I am childfree, but contemplating.</p>

<p>We had our baby girl last year and for the most part expenses have been 
minimal. We started a baby fund when we found out we were expecting to cover 
baby expenses and to smooth out our cash flow for the first months.</p> 
<p>Diapers are about $25/month using Amazon Mom and buying a big box. Clothes 
are minimal, first grandbaby means she&rsquo;s received gifts and we also 
gratefully accepted friends&rsquo; hand me downs (most were in great condition).
</p> 
<p>Food is cheap &ndash; breastfeeding and basby food right now. Many times we 
just puree a bit of what we&rsquo;re eating for her.</p> 
<p>I work from home, so childcare isn&rsquo;t on our expenses. We get more of 
her seasonal and short term baby gear from a nice consignment store in the area.
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d estimate that baby stuff is about $50/month. The first few months 
were higher since we had to grab some items we didn&rsquo;t receive on the baby 
registry.</p> 
<p>The biggest change since having our baby is health insurance premiums went 
up. We&rsquo;re now on the family plan instead of a couple, so it&rsquo;s about 
$200 extra a month. On the plus side, if we have another child the premiums 
would about stay the same.</p>

<p>Initial expenses aside, for our 6 month old. We&rsquo;re spending about $60 
in diapers each month and maybe $40 in clothes. There&rsquo;s nobody ahead of 
her to inherit clothes from and I&rsquo;m trying to warm my wife up to the idea 
of buying second-hand clothing. My mother in law watches her during the day so 
that saves a ton of money. We still give her $250 a month though since 
she&rsquo;s saving us a TON of money and peace of mind. She tried to refuse at 
first but we made her take it. It can be hard to resist toys and things that we 
think that she&rsquo;ll like but that&rsquo;s hard to add up and not really 
necessary. She&rsquo;s just started solid foods and it&rsquo;s not very 
expensive yet. Maybe another $30 a month but soon we&rsquo;ll start making and 
blending it ourselves to help with that too.</p> 
<p>So right now, the total is about $130 per month, $280 if we include giving 
the mother in law money.</p> 
<p>I should mention that we will soon start saving up for her college at the 
tune of abour $300 per month. My money could be off but this was what would be 
necessary for her to have a 4 year education at a cheaper school. Also, 
she&rsquo;ll start day care when she&rsquo;s 2 and prices for that are ranging 
from $600-$1100 per month.</p>

<p>We live in southern Ohio and have a 3 year old and one on the way. We both 
work full time. Our experience is-<br>
 DAYCARE, DAYCARE, DAYCARE!!!!<br>
 0-3 
We paid $8,500 for a babysitter to care for our son in her home. At 3 it was 
time to send him to full time preschool (much more stimulating). It costs 
$12,000 per year. I expect this to roll right into tuition for school which 
will be less at private K-8 for us, but about the same for high school and more 
for college. To me this is an ongoing expense.<br>
 Diapers- from 0-2 ran about 
$1-$2 per day. More when their tiny because you have to change more. I shopped 
deals and used coupons. Amazon for diapers is a great deal. We found generics 
to be a waste because they had to be changed more and often didn&rsquo;t hold 
at night. From 2-3 we have still had to use 1 diaper at night which costs about 
$0.21.<br>
 Clothing runs us about $50 per season plus shoes so I&rsquo;d say 
we spend about $150 per year.It was much cheaper as we did second hand 
&ldquo;mommy swap&rdquo; clothing for an infant, but found it doesn&rsquo;t 
work well for toddlers. So now I shop online sales and end of season and have 
them shipped free.<br>
 Food- Very little cost. I breastfed, and the most 
expensive thing was the pump @ $300 for a new pump. You can go used, just buy 
new parts and only use the used moter. But be careful if the pump is old and 
overworked it won&rsquo;t do the job well. And you&rsquo;ll be in your office 
all day trying to achieve 8oz for the next day.I nursed for 13 months. I mostly 
made my own baby food. The babyfood stage doesn&rsquo;t last long and it takes 
an hour of prep time to whip up a bunch of purees for your freezer.For the last 
2.5 years he&rsquo;s eaten whatever we eat.<br>
 Toys and equipment- you 
don&rsquo;t need to buy toys. You&rsquo;ll get most as gifts and they 
don&rsquo;t play with much anyway. Mine has plenty of toys and he still happier 
with an empty box, a stick or a patch of dirt. Baby equipment is so over 
marketed it&rsquo;s crazy. You really only need a crib, a bouncy seat, one or 
two good carseats and a stroller. The stroller and the bouncy seat you can find 
used easy.As they move to toddlerhood you&rsquo;ll probably need a booster seat 
for at the table and some kind of potty seat.<br>
 Medical expenses- this 
varies so much by child and by insurance that I think it&rsquo;s difficult to 
estimate. My pregnancy was expensive, but since he&rsquo;s only had two sick 
appointments. (thank you breastfeeding) Most plans cover well child visits 100% 
(and will have to under health care reform) so if you have an easy pregnancy, 
easy delivery and well child these costs can be minimal. But for planning 
purposes I would just estimate whatever the full amount of your deductible is 
and cheer when it&rsquo;s less!<br>
 Activities- this varies. Some people do 
&ldquo;baby&rdquo; classes and such. If you work you won&rsquo;t have time. 
I&rsquo;ve noticed now that little buddy is three we spend about $200 a year on 
sports, museum trips etc for him. I think this would be A LOT more if I stayed 
home, but then I wouldn&rsquo;t have daycare costs.If you don&rsquo;t have 
family to pitch in, plan for at least $50 a month for babysitting for one date 
night.This could be avoided if you &ldquo;traded&rdquo; with another couple 
with kids.</p> 
<p>I too think that children get a lot more expensive as they age. Starting at 
about 8. They want more things, they eat more, they need more clothes, more 
activities, take up more space etc. You find yourself needing the bigger house 
in the better school district which costs more. Then they need tuition and 
transportation and allowance etc.<br>
 All this being said, if you really have 
always wanted a family with children, you will NEVER, NEVER think about the 
money.You just budget and do it.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t fathom spending as much as some of you spend per month on a 
child. It just sounds absolutely absurd. Everything is so volatile with our 
economy right now, I can&rsquo;t imagine thinking it a fine time to bring a new 
life into the world &mdash; either for the child or for your pocketbook. I know 
the saying goes something like, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never be financially ready 
for a kid, so you just have to go for it&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s the sentiment, at 
least), but now is a particularly bad time especially if you&rsquo;re reliant 
on someone else&rsquo;s whim for a paycheck. Your $10k emergency fund is going 
to feel like a handful of pennies if you lose your job and you&rsquo;ve got a 
child to support.</p> 
<p>I think we&rsquo;re entering a strange new era and I&rsquo;m not 
particularly confident in the footing yet. It&rsquo;s not the 50s anymore, nor 
is it the 90s. We can&rsquo;t keep thinking the old ways still hold up in 
today&rsquo;s environment. Just because you&rsquo;re physically capable of 
having a child and other people are doing it, that doesn&rsquo;t mean 
it&rsquo;s the right choice for you. Stop thinking of yourself for a minute and 
think of your future child. What opportunities will he or she have in our 
society? I think things look pretty grim for the youth right now, sadly. I hope 
that turns around soon.</p>

<p>A child won&rsquo;t have any opportunities in our society if he or she does 
not exist. The world is a scary place, indeed, but if you&rsquo;re cowering in 
the corner and waiting for it to get better before you have kids, you&rsquo;ll 
never have them. Don&rsquo;t make hopeful parents sound so selfish for wanting 
to have a family.</p> 
<p>Instead, how about having kids and teaching them to be contributing members 
of our society who try to make the world a better place? That&rsquo;s a good

<p>Matt, by all means, have as many children as you like. We definitely have 
the resources to support them.</p> 
<p>Regardless of what your personal opinion is, the reality is that a poor 
economy is going to persuade fewer people to have children. Fewer children 
means fewer tax payers to support an aging population. Just look at Japan; 
awful recession in the early 90s, declining birth rates. Negative population 
growth is not good for an economy that continuously needs more money pumped 
into it to survive.</p> 
<p>So maybe you aren&rsquo;t going &ldquo;cower in a corner&rdquo; but many 
people will. We live in a society. We all need to take care of each other or it 
just simply won&rsquo;t function. This isn&rsquo;t about &ldquo;I have enough 
money to live comfortably for my retirement years&rdquo; &mdash; if you have to 
step over a thousand beggars just to get to the grocery store, that&rsquo;s not 
going to be a happy retirement (hyperbole, I know).</p>

lives into the world that might not live at the extremely high materialistic 
level we&rsquo;ve become accustomed to the last 40+ years. Shame on all the 
indulgent fools during the Great Depression, WWI, WWII, other wars, the Red 
Scare, all much scarier times than now, who decided to selfishly propagate 
despite uncertain futures. Their miserable wretch offspring surely got their 
comeuppance, what with living in houses (with A/C!), driving motorized vehicles 
(often enclosed), and screens displaying flickering images (from B&amp;W to in

fight for survival and huddle here with my brood and 300 fellow squatters in 
this burned out abandoned Apple Store under what says it was once a

<p>What a gloomy way to look at things! I had my children when I was happily 
married and the economy was doing just fine. Fast forward to today: I&rsquo;m a 
single mom and the economy is in the pits. You can&rsquo;t predict the future, 
but if you assume the worst, you&rsquo;ll be paralyzed.</p> 
<p>One thing to consider is your support system. If you have a fantastic 
network of friends and family who will assist and support you if things get 
tough (as I do), then you can feel a little more confident about having 
children even if your financial situation isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>

<p>Not wveryone is having a bad time with the economy. My kids are doing fine. 
My daughter is at home while her husband works. My son and daughter in law are 
planning the same thing in a few years.<br>
 From a grandparent POV. I would 
say that we contributed $200 a month for the first year. Crib, car seats 
(cannot buy those used), stroller, clothes. Those early years were tight while 
my son in law served his country. Now we put away for education. I was put 
through college by my grandparents. My son and daughter had money from their 
grandparents. We hope to continue the generosity.<br>
 Just as you lament the 
future, we are excited for it. It is a wonderful world and we hope our 
grandchild will be willing and able to contribute to it in the future.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that the most important thing to a child is the love from 
their parent(s).You might not see that now, but in the long run it proves out. 
Borrow clothes, cribs and toys. Get a library card. Coupon for diapers and , 
most of all, love your child!</p>

<p>The world has always had such doom and gloom. In the 60s, it was the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. In the 80s, people were still worried about the Cold War and 
enviromental diasters. Ten years ago, it was terrorists and the changing world

<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re in the U.S., what kind of health benefits do you 
have? Check your maternity coverage, as well as what coverage you will have if 
your child is born prematurely or with any kind of health problem. Look into 
how much it will cost per month to add a child to your policy and think about 
how you will set aside enough to cover your entire deductible if you have to. 
Even ordinary medical bills can add up, from recurring ear infections to a 
broken arm to dental visits and eyeglasses. (Life insurance is also a good 
idea, just in case.) You can be creative and find ways to save with food, 
clothes, childcare, transportation, housing, etc. It&rsquo;s not as easy to 
creatively save your way out of an unexpected $10,000 hospital bill.</p>

<p>Our son is 12 now. While we no longer pay for Montessori pre-school, we do 
pay for his education in many ways. For instance, two weekly music lessons; 
participation in theater groups, bands, and choirs; camps; sports; and public 
school fees add up to $3000-$4000 a year.</p> 
<p>But we save money in other ways. We live within walking distance to his 
school, we don&rsquo;t own a car, and we use the library a lot. For us, 
it&rsquo;s really important to value his education, make sure he has healthy 
food available, and that we have a lot of time together as a family. We love to 
travel, and he&rsquo;s already lived in two countries and visited many others.
</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, I think it&rsquo;s about priorities. We&rsquo;re 
hands-on parents, but we have also really worked to create the kind of life 
that we want as a family.</p>

<p>I totally agree with Eve&rsquo;s comment &ndash; babies can be super-cheap. 
It&rsquo;s as they get older that things begin to cost more than you would 
think. You might not mind buying that first car seat, but (depending on where 
you live) you may be surprised that you still are buying booster seats many 
years later.</p> 
<p>At the same time, a lot of those costs later on are going to depend on your 
parenting style and choices. Not things like glasses and health coverage, 
obviously, but those extra classes and camps and cool clothes and videogames 
and the big mini-van and so on.</p> 
<p>Also, if you are on a budget, it helps to teach kids about money management 
as early as possible so they can help make the choices with you, so they 
don&rsquo;t ever feel denied &mdash; but that&rsquo;s a whole different subject.
</p> 
<p>For us, personally, the main &ldquo;cost&rdquo; was a smaller household 
income, as the time you spend with your kid(s) is time you aren&rsquo;t 
working. (Whether you work part-time or not at all, or you still work full-time 
but now can&rsquo;t put in extra hours &mdash; it&rsquo;s all time you could 
have spent earning more money. But worth it.)</p>

<p>such variation in this expense! For My babies, I spent very little. I had a 
barely used infant car seat from my sister along with all necessary clothes, I 
wore my babies in a sling and never really used a stroller or a crib or other 
expensive baby gear (much of which can be borrowed quite easily). Cloth diapers 
saved a lot of money and I nursed exclusively until I moved them to table food 
(I made baby food for a very short period). No day care cost because I stayed 
home. We had great medical insurance so medical costs were neglibable. As they 
got older, I purchased high quality toys and clothes at yard sales. That worked 
up until they were about 8 to 10. Now they cost more: private school tuition, 
new clothes because I can&rsquo;t find nice stylish clothes used anymore. 
Activities such as dance and music lessons, after school programs, presents for 
birthdays, etc. Must be around $1200 a month. Much of that is tuition, though. 
Trying to save money for college, really you should budget in quite a bit for 
that from day 1. Small children really need very, very little to be very, very 
happy. Big children need more, not all that much more sometimes, but still I 
would say save the baby money you want to spend for later. Your kids will thank 
you for it when you forgo fancy baby frills and instead have the money for them 
to pursue their dreams later on.</p>

<p>Wow, I have no idea a dollar amount. It depends on the lifestyle you lead, 
where you live, whether you have good health insurance, etc&hellip;<br>
 I am 
married with five children ages nine and under. We live comfortably on just 
under $90k per year, we have no non-mortgage debt, and we are able to save for 
retirement. We have no childcare costs, but there is an opportunity cost with 
me quitting my engineering job to stay home (a decision well worth the cost, 
for me). I breastfed all the kids and never had to buy formula. Babies have the 
initial costs of crib/stroller/clothing/etc, but many can be obtained 
secondhand for little or no money. Diapers cost a lot. Children do get more 
expensive as they get older. Their clothes and shoes cost more, they eat more, 
they like to participate in activities. Even public school is not without costs 
for fundraisers. We have 529s set up for each child to save for college, but 
those are mostly funded by gifts from family at Christmas and birthdays, and we 
haven&rsquo;t been able to regularly contribute to them ourselves in awhile. My 
hope is that I will be back to work by the time the first enters college and we 
can help pay some of the tuition costs out of my income.<br>
 I do want to 
point out that the marginal cost for each additional child is not as much as 
those initial costs. We re-use everything, kids share rooms, and we already 
bought the minivan after the first child!<br>
 One additional expense with 
children is good life insurance- a must!</p>

<p>When I had my kids, I thought the expense would go down as they got older. 
Ha! Instead of paying for diapers and daycare, I&rsquo;m paying for LOTS of 
food, clothes they outgrow so fast I can&rsquo;t believe it, dance lessons, and 
lots of miscellaneous expenses (I need $10 for this school trip, etc.). The 
good news is there are many ways to control these expenses. Instead of buying 
them school lunches, which were costing almost $5 each per day for my sons, we 
started sending them to school with packed lunches. More nutritious than the 
junk they serve at school anyway, and less than half the cost. I buy as many of 
our clothes as I can used, or wait for big sales. My daughter takes dance 
lessons, but we send her to the cheaper city run dance school&ndash;about half 
the cost of the other dance schools in town. (Unless they&rsquo;re going to 
make a career out of dance, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter much!) I don&rsquo;t 
provide my kids with cell phones, laptops or any other gadget they want. My 
oldest has a job and he buys his own video games, etc. as well as saving for 
college. We don&rsquo;t make a lot of money but we are careful and we have a 
pretty good life. I think the toughest part is knowing I won&rsquo;t be able to 
help them out with college much. I&rsquo;ll do what I can, but it won&rsquo;t 
be as much as I&rsquo;d like. And teenage boys never stop eating.</p>

<p>We have 2 teenage sons, 14 and 16. They spend one week with us, one week 
with their dad, etc., so I have a fairly clear picture of the difference in 
grocery cost, at least. Weeks they are here run about $200 in groceries, weeks 
they&rsquo;re not run about $150.</p> 
<p>Childcare was a while ago, but yes, it was expensive, even for part time 
after-school afternoons. Summer was worse because it was full-day. Now they go 
to a two week sleep-away camp in the summer (and hang out at home the rest). 
That runs about $850 each. Also: orchestra camp, 1 week, about $300.</p> 
<p>Lessons &amp; classes: viola $50 a week, aikido $90 a month</p> 
<p>School trips: variable, of course, but our viola player has both jazz band 
and orchestra trips. Big one last year to Vienna &ndash; $2500. Domestic ones 
more like $300-500.</p> 
<p>On the plus side: they cut the lawn! And clear snow! And unload groceries! 
(We personally don&rsquo;t require a lot of chores from ours, but don&rsquo;t 
forget that even quite early on, kids can start contributing work to the family 
unit.)</p>

<p>One significant kid-related cost I&rsquo;ve seen mentioned in a few 
comments is about the need to have larger vehicles to accommodate kids. My wife 
is pregnant with our first right now and is due in October. We&rsquo;ve been 
discussing whether we&rsquo;re going to need to buy a bigger car in the next 
year or so. Right now we have &rsquo;01 and &rsquo;05 Honda Civics (both paid 
off and still running decently). From talking with friends and family who have 
kids, quite a few have sort of laughed at us when we told them that we 
weren&rsquo;t planning on buying a bigger car. They basically said that a kid 
needs more stuff than you think. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true, but still, 
wouldn&rsquo;t a plain old Civic be enough to accommodate 2 adults and 1 kid? 
(When/if we have a second kid, that&rsquo;s a different story.)</p>

 Don&rsquo;t let the &ldquo;Jonses&rsquo;&rdquo; influence you. 
When our first was born we had a VW Jetta and a Mazda Protege. Both small four 
door sedans. Both with over 100k miles. It&rsquo;s not EASY, but it&rsquo;s 
totally possible. You&rsquo;ll really have to shop for car seats that fit. 
Especially since they have to be rear facing for 2 years or more. But you or 
your wife are not super tall, it can be done. Just put the seat in the middle 
and go! It&rsquo;s tight but it can work. Especially if your alternative is to 
go into debt to buy another car.</p>

<p>agreed, you don&rsquo;t need a bigger car. I have friends who kept their 
mini &mdash; true, the smaller the car, the more of a challenge it is to find a 
car seat that will fit while it faces backwards, but it&rsquo;s still totally 
doable. Just take your car with you when picking out seats/strollers, to make 
sure they fit.</p>

<p>Yes, we kept our 100k miles 4-door Alero until #3 came along and we 
couldn&rsquo;t figure out away to get all 3 carseats in the back. It was a 
little bit of a hassle getting them in and out, but was by no means impossible.

<p>And there are even car seats narrow enough to do 3 across &mdash; we have 
an older Radian car seat and you could fit 3 across in even most small cars if 
you had too.</p> 
<p>Definitely check sizes in person &mdash; the two big problems you will have 
with a smaller car are getting a stroller into the trunk (some of the 
super-strollers are huge even when folded) and getting some rear-facing seats 
in. I love our Radian but it is TALL, we could have never used it rear-facing.

<p>You&rsquo;ll find something to fit though, don&rsquo;t worry!</p>

<p>Haha, I&rsquo;ve been shocked at all the people that went straight into a 
mini-van, too. When my son was born, we had a 4-door Mitsubishi Lancer (about 
the size of a Civic) and that worked just fine for us. We could pack ourselves, 
our son, and our dog up in the car for weekend trips to my Dad&rsquo;s house 
with no issue. Typical evenings out, you need a diaper bag and a stroller. We 
pretty much only use an umbrella stroller, which have very little footprint on 
trunk space. It is NOT necessary to upgrade if you don&rsquo;t feel the need to 
take the whole nursery everytime you leave the house. I say keep your cars and 
upgrade when you can save up to buy it in full.</p>

<p>I like your mindset about making it work with what you have. I agree with 
Em: it&rsquo;s not easy, but it&rsquo;s doable in most circumstances. I&rsquo;m 
6&rsquo;4&Prime; and drive an &rsquo;08 Civic Coupe that&rsquo;s paid off. My 
son has a rear-facing seat, so that requires me to climb in the backseat to 
take him in and out. Not every seat will fit in there and I contemplated 
replacing it with a four door, but it&rsquo;s just not worth the extra cost.</p>
<p>However, the rear-facing seat leaves only just enough room for my wife to 
sit up front. She&rsquo;s only average height, so it&rsquo;s not really a 
problem, but somebody taller wouldn&rsquo;t fit there.</p>

<p>We have a new CR-V that is earmarked to be the main family car &mdash; but

<p>I think you can do it with a two door so long as you find a seat that fits. 
Especially if it&rsquo;s not every day, all the time. Remember it&rsquo;s just 
two years rear facing. That&rsquo;s the toughest time. The car seats become 
smaller after that and for the most part a &lt;2 year old can climb into their 
own seat and all you have to do is lean back there and do their buckles. At 
least that's my experience. To me it's worth trying.</p>

<p>My niece&rsquo;s father has a 2 door sports car-ish thing that he bought 
when he had no plans for kids and wanted something cool. Then boom! baby. He 
kept the 2 door and it was just fine. The carseat had to go in the middle and 
it got cramped if anyone else was sitting in the backseat but it was just fine 
for 2 adults and baby. Crowded but totally doable.</p>

<p>The costs do vary wildly. Since my kids went to daycare our costs 
haven&rsquo;t increased much, but they have definitely shifted around.</p> 
<p>Health care: we had one chronically ill infant who was in &amp; out of the 
doctor&rsquo;s office, and our second required tens of thousands of dollars of 
surgeries &amp; appointments with a big-city specialist to prevent problems 
&amp; worries later in life. Thankfully we have great health insurance, but if 
we didn&rsquo;t this would have sunk us.</p> 
<p>If you have to work, childcare can be expensive and it varies wildly too. 
My BIL lived in a low-wage area and paid $250/month. I live in a high-cost area 
and paid $250/week (and this was more than a decade ago, the cost in my area 
has probably grown 50-60% since then.) The cost of child care can also vary 
significantly within a metro area. I moved 45 minutes away to a more desirable 
part of my metro area and suddenly found myself paying more than $200 per month 
more per child. All told, my family probably spent $100,000 per child on 
daycare before they started school.</p> 
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t end there. We pay around $300 per month per child for 
after-school care, and another $300 per week for our kids to go to the town rec 
dept camp in summer, or to child care on school vacations. And this is the 
cheap camp. &ldquo;Real&rdquo; summer day camps can cost $700+ per week.</p> 
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone else mention the cost of housing. Not only more 
space, but as you get older there is pressure to live in a town with a good 
public school system, nice parks &amp; playgrounds, and safe. These towns cost 
more to live in.</p> 
<p>My husband and I limit our kids to two extracurricular activities each, and 
we pay $500-$700 per month on this depending on what the kids are doing at any 
given time. One of their activities is piano, so we had to buy one of those 
too. (You can get them for free on craigslist, but they usually cost a fortune 
to move and tune. We bought a gently used electric piano, but it was still 
several hundred dollars.)</p> 
<p>As to babysitters, in my area the price ranges from $5/hour for a young 
teen to watch the kids while you go out someplace local for an hour or two to 
$15/hour for an adult if you are going to be gone long or go far.</p> 
<p>And we are always saving for college.</p>

<p>We have three children ages 8, 5, and 2. Last year we spent on average 
$2500/month on child-specific costs, the vast majority being childcare. Besides 
the childcare this included 529 savings, toys, (mostly 2nd hand) clothing, 
diapers, (limited) recreational activities, and school lunch. This does not 
count the FSA tax break but also doesn&rsquo;t include groceries, which 
probably cancel each other out. Thankfully we have plenty of room in our budget 
to handle these costs, but I sure will be glad when we are done paying for 
daycare!</p>

<p>That &lsquo;so far&rsquo; is really interesting!</p> 
<p>We have a 10 month old and we&rsquo;ve spent very little money on him so 
far. I&rsquo;ve posted about a lot of the ways we&rsquo;ve saved money in my 
Baby on a Budget series:http://preservingpennies.com/category/baby-on-a-budget/ 
We cloth diaper most of the time and I make my own wipes. I breastfeed and make 
my own baby food. We use all hand me downs or second hand stuff- not really a 
sacrifice since second hand baby stuff is pretty well new anyways. We have 
pretty good benefits that pay for baby chiropractic visits (yup) and the couple 
of prescriptions we&rsquo;ve needed. Because of these things our ongoing costs 
have been very low.<br>
 This year so far I&rsquo;ve spent $190 on him and $50 
of that was for baby-sitting. $60 of that was for second hand clothes and toys 
that I wanted- he didn&rsquo;t actually need. The rest of that was for diapers- 
I stocked up because of a good sale. I do still put him in disposables when his 
grandparents have him and at night so there is an expense there ($30 every 
couple of months maybe). In contrast, I only spent $56 in October and $25 of 
that was his halloween costume which I made and $6 of it was for a toy. When I 
go back to work he will probably be going into care for 5 half days a week and 
around here that runs us about $600 a month. The original cost of the cloth 
diapers that we use ran us about $400 but they are well worth it and we will be 
able to use them for subsequent children (or re-sell them). We also get about 
$140 a month from the government for him. We&rsquo;ve saved up a little over 
$1000 for his education costs since he&rsquo;s been born which has been funded 
entirely by the government money and some money gifted to him when he was born.

<p>We spent very little on start-up costs: we were very lucky with 
hand-me-downs and gifts for large ticket items. That said, our daycare costs as 
much as our condo payment: $1000/month. Diaper service cost us $60/month, and 
then there was the odds-n-ends of clothes, medicines, etc. that I would 
estimate are another $100/month.</p> 
<p>It can be very little with breastfeeding, cloth diapers, and hand-me-downs, 
but daycare is a killer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to totally calculate based on what you&rsquo;ve seen. I 
think the biggest thing is, if you&rsquo;re going to have kids, plan on 
spending more time than anything else. Even the experiences, your kids will 
want your time more than anything else. As they get older that will change 
some, but I think the teenagers who want nothing to do with their parents are 
that way because from 7-12 they had little to do with them.</p> 
<p>Yes, medical expenses are what you need to plan for, and I bet that&rsquo;s 
10x the normal costs. But my wife and I always wonder what people give up with 
the $1000 a month daycare. My wife saw all my kids first steps, first time they 
rolled over, first words, etc. And I generally knew within minutes on the phone 
they happened.</p> 
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a TED talk on how someone&rsquo;s kid said it was the 
best day ever just going to the park and getting pizza with dad. Nothing 
special to Dad, but his kid thought it was the best ever. So by far, if 
you&rsquo;re going to have kids, be prepared to sacrifice most on time. You 
could probably easily stay under $200 a month otherwise. And kids don&rsquo;t 
need to go to the doctor for every sniffle!!! You just need to know when 
it&rsquo;s more than a sniffle </p> 
<p>My wife&rsquo;s parents also made her get a job early for money, and they 
babysat and mowed yards to save up for a lot of stuff. We&rsquo;ll probably not 
be so strict, but I definitely think having the kids have their own skin in the 
game is the best. How many people do you know who blew off college and partied 
just because it wasn&rsquo;t on them to pay for it?</p>

<p>I agree that the biggest cost of having children is time. I&rsquo;m not 
talking about the time spent with them because that&rsquo;s a given. If you 
have kids, you need to love them enough to spend time with them. What I am 
talking about is the time away from any sort of income producing efforts and 
the time they take from your personal life. It&rsquo;s an hour here, 1/2 day 
there, full day if they get sick. Time to take them to daycare, appointments, 
school activities, sunday school. Days, evenings, weekends. I am raising 3 
grandkids (who would have otherwise gone to foster care) and between dcotors, 
dentists, eyeglasses, ortho, etc, etc my husband and I miss work at least 1-2 
times a week. It not only costs time and money but reduces your income because 
of time away from work. It&rsquo;s not only the cost of children, it&rsquo;s 
the reduction in income that needs to be considered.</p>

<p>The good news is that baby costs are pretty fixed so it&rsquo;s possible to 
budget.<br>
 Babies can be very cheap. My youngest was practically free. We 
barely noticed him, budget wise. Even diapers weren&rsquo;t much because I 
probably didn&rsquo;t change him as often as I changed the first couple of 
kids. His toys were things like wooden spoons and soup cans. Once he started 
eating, we went with table food.</p> 
<p>As kids get older, they do get expensive. And the cost varies so much from 
month to month and child to child it&rsquo;s impossible to put forth an 
accurate projected figure for someone else.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we spend at least 3k total each month on our kids, probably 
more and that doesn&rsquo;t include private and parochial school tuitions. 
I&rsquo;m talking about food, lessons, sports equipment and fees, braces and 
other dental, medical co pays and insurance, school trips, gas to drive them to 
practice and friends&rsquo; homes, bicycles, larger home, higher utilities, etc.
</p> 
<p>Could it be done more cheaply? Of course. However, drastically altering it 
at this point would be unpleasant for us and them.</p> 
<p>My husband and I laugh, though, when financial planners tell us we&rsquo;ll 
need to replace 80% of our income when we retire. Do they mean when the kids 
are out of the (by then) paid for house? We could live like kings on half our 
current income once the kids are grown and gone.</p>

$800/month, $60/month on disposable diapers, $20/healthcare (random doctor 
visits because we&rsquo;re new parents and don&rsquo;t always know the 
difference between a cold and a real illness), $100/food since our daughter is 
an extremely picky eater and drinks a lot of milk.</p>

<p>Something that caused me to spend a lot more on kids that I would have 
planned for is that I had twins. That means the second kid can&rsquo;t reuse 
the first kid&rsquo;s car seat or stroller, and though you don&rsquo;t really 
have to buy two of everything, you do need twice as many shoes, diapers, etc. 
We managed to avoid getting a bigger car, but if we had already had one kid in 
a car seat before the twins were born, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to fit 
three car seats in our tiny Honda Civic, so a new car would have been part of 
the cost.</p> 
<p>Daycare is also terrible. We&rsquo;ve had a couple different situations 
since they were born, but it has averaged about $1600/month just for regular 
care while we work. This doesn&rsquo;t include occasional nights out, or lost 
wages when a kid is sick and someone has to stay home, or summer camp for the 
week the preschool is closed between the school year and the summer session.</p>
<p>On the upside, we spend almost nothing on toys. Between grandparents, 
birthday presents, and always having a best friend there to play with, our kids 
don&rsquo;t need anything else, and don&rsquo;t even ask for much. We&rsquo;ll 
see how that changes when they get older (they are 4 right now) and start 
playing sports or getting into separate hobbies where supplies can&rsquo;t be 
shared.</p>

<p>My little Hyundai Accent is doing just FINE accommodating one kid. 
We&rsquo;re fairly sure a second car seat will fit in there too (though 
we&rsquo;re hoping DC will have graduated to a booster by then so it 
won&rsquo;t be quite so cramped with the infant + 5 year old).</p> 
<p>We got a Graco for the infant seat (highest rated in consumer reports) and 
a Britax for the toddler+ seat (again, highest rated). No problems at all.</p> 
<p>DH&rsquo;s Honda Civic is positively roomy in the back with the Britax.</p> 
<p>Unlike what Tyler K says, you do not need to get a bigger car for a 
carseat. If you think you do, then spend another $200-$300 on a different 
carseat, not several thousand (or even 10s of thousands) on another car.</p>

<p>Some of the Britax are smaller than others. It&rsquo;s a good idea to try 
them in the car before purchasing. There&rsquo;s also someplace online that has 
a forum that talks about car/carseat matches.</p> 
<p>Again, getting a different carseat is less expensive than getting a 
different car! Even if it means going through 3 carseat stages before hitting 
booster stage rather than 2.</p>

<p>We spent about 700$ in preparing for our baby (car seats, etc.). We pay 
about 700$/month in daycare costs and under 100$/month in other items (toys, 
diapers, etc.). I only buy items at consignment, etc. Daycare is the 
killer&hellip;</p>

<p>If you are thinking of having children it is wise to investigate the costs. 
However, the benefits should also be considered. The value of guiding another 
human that is part you is a priceless journey that ends only when you do. The 
value of seeing the world through the eyes of someone who is seeing things for 
the first time..ever. The value of getting to re-live your childhood or 
re-write it so it&rsquo;s better for your children. The experience of, usually 
for the first time, putting someone else first, ahead of you, in your thoughts 
is a maturing experience even if you are in your 30s or 40s. Worried about 
money? Get all the hand me downs and used stuff you can. The baby doesn&rsquo;t 
know or care how much the crib costs or if the comforter and pillow sham match. 
The baby justs wants you to love it. Find a way for the mom or dad to stay home 
with the baby for the first 2 years at a minimum. Unless you make a ton of 
money the childcare and doctor&rsquo;s visits will eat up your earnings from 
the job. Consider the amount of money it costs to go to the job, gas, clothes, 
lunch, child care, lost time for sick baby, doctor visits. It is usually 
cheaper to stay home.</p>

<p>Eek. This right here is why we are not having more children. Day care costs 
would force one of us to stay home, and neither of us is willing to give up 
another two years or more of work to do it. And I am sure now that I&rsquo;ve 
expressed this, I will be told how unfit I am to parent. But I am not saying it 
as some clueless DINK who has never had kids, I know exactly how much money and 
work it takes&ndash;we have a 10-year-old now. She&rsquo;s the best kid in the 
world&ndash;but I still wouldn&rsquo;t have another.</p>

<p>Daycare costs when they were younger were about $800/month. When they are 
super younger, if you don&rsquo;t have hand-me-downs, clothing can be very 
expensive. (I&rsquo;ve never been able to do hand-me-downs for shoes&ndash;they 
get too worn out.) They go thru 3 different sizes in the first year alone. As 
they age, I&rsquo;d say costs don&rsquo;t necessary go down.</p> 
<p> Mine just started public school, so no more daycare, but this means 
$300/month for afterschool care. Summer care is about $150 per week per child. 
Clothing can be expensive, but we off-set the costs by selling their old toys 
and clothes at a bi-annual swap and buying &ldquo;new&rdquo; clothes from other 
consignors. However, now there are after school activities like dance and 
gymnastics. I also started a college saving plan of about $150 per month. We 
get invited to a lot of children&rsquo;s parties, which average to $20 month. 
The children have a TON of requests from their school for parties and special 
events, as well as fundraisers. While these are &ldquo;optional&rdquo;, your 
child wants to contribute to parties and if you don&rsquo;t, that means another 
parent is in essence paying for your child by bringing in the necessary treats 
and craft items. (As school budgets shrink, these craft/party days are 
transferred to the parent.)</p> 
<p>However, for me, some of the hardest costs to calculate are lifestyle 
changes that happen based on lack of time or energy. We eat out more 
now-sometimes because we have no time between school and gymnastics and 
sometimes because I don&rsquo;t have the energy to cook both a wonderful at 
home meal AND that cake for the cake walk in the same evening.</p>

<p>My daughter is 13mo and is NOT in daycare (I work at home and my boss is ok 
with me watching her while I work).</p> 
<p>We spend at least $45 on diapers and $7 on wipes (we buy in bulk at Sams 
&ndash; so 1 box of wipes lasts us at least 2 months. The wipes are $14 a box). 
Food costs about $60 &ndash; $70 per month because she&rsquo;s not 100% on our 
food. Once she&rsquo;s consistently eating the same food we eat, that will go 
down.</p> 
<p>Clothes &ndash; Around $50 &ndash; but this can be less if you buy at 
resale / second hand shops. Look around your community for mom sales (they 
happen a lot).</p> 
<p>Toys &ndash; Christmas &amp; her birthday are close, so we spent about $200 
between the two. But seriously, she&rsquo;d rather bang two empty soda cans 
together than play with her real toys&hellip;</p> 
<p>Healthcare &ndash; we&rsquo;re lucky b/c she isn&rsquo;t in daycare (so 
she&rsquo;s had 2 colds) and we have great insurance (so we pay nothing for 
well baby visits). Find out how much you pay for well baby care and multiply 
that by 6 because that&rsquo;s the minimum number of dr visits you&rsquo;ll 
have in the first year.</p> 
<p>Other costs will depend on how much you decide to spend. You can find nice, 
safe, inexpensive cribs. You don&rsquo;t need a changing table &ndash; put a 
pad on top of a waist high dresser. Don&rsquo;t buy expensive clothes or fancy 
outfits &ndash; you&rsquo;re little one will ruin them once you start feeding 
real food! A safe car seat can be found for about $100.</p> 
<p>When she was very little, we had the added cost of formula &ndash; probably 
$40 &ndash; $60 per month. The walmart brand is just as good as the name brands 
assuming you just need a regular formula.</p> 
<p>Babies need:<br>
 -Somewhere safe to sleep<br>
 -Clothes and blankets to 
keep them warm<br>
 -Something to catch their waste<br>
 -Food (breast milk, 
formula, etc)<br>
 -Parents to love them<br>
 -A car seat if you plan to drive 
them anywhere</p> 
<p>Everything else is gravy</p>

<p>I budget $1,300.00 a year per child. I now have two girls, newborn and 3yr. 
$300 for their bday parties another $1,000 for clothes and misc expenses. 
Daycare is another expense at $500 a month for each. For a family of 4, our 
grocery budget is $600 a month. There are no real expenses outside of what I 
have outlined. Small expenses are picked up by either parent ( we also have our 
own allocations). Dr. visits outside the norm may or may not be considered 
emergency expenses.</p>

<p>This comment was intended for Robert Zaleski (#51) above. For some reason 
I&rsquo;m having a devil of a time posting it to him.</p> 
<p>While spending &lt;$200 per month on a child is doable, it's not easy and 
in my opinion, it's not ideal. First off, it would mean lots of couponing in 
the grocery store, learning to cut hair, scouring thrift shops and yard sales, 
and oral care at the dental school. And don't forget transportation costs. If 
that's all we're talking about, less than $200 is difficult but doable.</p> 
<p>But the big thing is spending &lt;$200 would involve a lot of 
&quot;no&quot; &ndash; no Little League, no Scouting, no school play, no Math 
tutor, no dance lessons, no field trips, etc.</p> 
<p>Sometimes that's what we parents need to do &ndash; say no to our kids when 
we would rather say yes, when it might be to the child's benefit to say yes. 
That's life and life's not fair. But I think to recommend &lt;$200 as a 
budgeting figure is unrealistic and will be necessarily thrusting a parentally 
imposed &quot;difference&quot; upon a child. Life is not all playing in the 
park and in the backyard, particularly with school aged children.</p>

<p>We have a big range (2, 11, 16 and one on the way) so our budget currently 
touches on pretty much all of the needs kids have in their little life-at-home 
spans </p> 
<p>Clothing: $100/month covers all 5 of us &ndash; we get a lot of the 
kids&rsquo; stuff used, but they do need new shoes every few months. And they 
always need 2 pairs at a time &ndash; play shoes and school shoes. And church 
shoes if your life includes that.</p> 
<p>Baby supplies (diapers, wipes, equipment, toys, etc.): $75/month</p> 
<p>Daycare: $1,175/month</p> 
<p>Health insurance: $684 for a family plan</p> 
<p>Kids activities (sports, music lessons, etc.): $100/month</p> 
<p>Summer camp: $100/month (I only have one kid going to summer camp this year 
&ndash; yay! It&rsquo;s about $1200 for the whole summer and we save for it all 
year, of course)</p> 
<p>Medical/dental: $100/month, but sometimes we are under-funded here, like if 
someone needed braces, we&rsquo;d have to figure that out. Mostly goes to 
doctor visit co-pays, prescriptions, etc.</p> 
<p>For college, we save $169/month into a regular savings account for my 
oldest son, which he matches. The plan is to save up together for community 
college in 2013. We&rsquo;ll up the amount as we go, but we&rsquo;re in it 
50/50 with him. We&rsquo;ll be doing the same for my middle son, and 
they&rsquo;re spaced just far enough apart that we won&rsquo;t likely have 
overlap in needs. For the littlest two, we&rsquo;re not doing education plans 
for a little while. All the research I&rsquo;ve done shows them performing very 
poorly, so I just don&rsquo;t trust that it&rsquo;s a good place to pour money 
at the moment&hellip;</p>

<p>I have not read ahead. I did not see if you would be a working parent or if 
one of you would stay home. Will you have to pay a thousand dollars for day 
care a month or not. are you intested in just baby costs or lifetime costs? 
Much of this you can figure out yourself, in terms of early life.</p> 
<p>by the same token if one of you stays at home, that can also be a cost-only 
you can do the math.</p> 
<p>Will you need day care, or will one of you be a stay at home parent (a 
thousand dollars a month)</p> 
<p>Will your health insurance rates increase, and do they cover maternity and 
well baby care. Once my husband and I moved to a family plan (when he married 
me) all children were part of the family. what will your copays be for well 
baby and shots and occasional illness.</p> 
<p>Is your home appropriate for a kid, say, up to five, your will you need a 
new apartment or home with additional space and costs.</p> 
<p>What is your attitude to new and used stuff. On any given saturday I can 
(and do for resale) go out and buy like new baby clothes, toys, and supplies 
for dirt cheap. New babies NEED car seats, a place to sleep, a place to eat, 
and a place to put their clothing in terms of furiture. Will you want 
everything? will it need to all be new?</p> 
<p>How will you feed your baby. Mine are adults but its easy to do the math on 
formula.</p> 
<p>How will you diaper your baby&hellip;figure out use and check out the adds 
for diapers.</p> 
<p>Im assuming your car is baby appropriate and you dont have to move from a 
sports car to a real car.</p>

<p>Our approach to child rearing was somewhat, er, different than is the norm. 
Our friends and relatives were horrified that our small children were doing 
their own laundry and taking turns with the household chores and cooking.</p> 
<p>See, we all worked in this household. Son was out with me pouring footers 
in subdivisions when he was just tall enough to hold the concrete chute while I 
did the grunt work. Daughter was doing demolition work when she was old enough 
to hold a tiny little sledgehammer. No free rides for anybody.</p> 
<p>When the kids wanted horses, they had to take care of the feeding, stall 
mucking, grooming, tack care and TRAINING of the horses themselves. Want a 
skate board or a new bicycle? Well, y&rsquo;all know where the tools are. Draw 
up the plans and get a list of the raw materials. Need a vehicle? We&rsquo;ll 
get one that needs a major mechanical overhaul and then do the work ourselves.
</p> 
<p>Yet our poor abused kids turned out to be competent, independent adults 
with many skills that are getting paid MORE than the friends&rsquo; and 
relatives&rsquo; kids who got a free ride through college. They prefer to work 
for others right now because they KNOW that business owners have no time that 
is really &ldquo;off&rdquo; or &ldquo;free&rdquo; but are quite capable of 
running their own businesses and, indeed, have in the past.</p> 
<p>This summer, the grandkids will be raising rabbits, ducks, and chickens for 
their parents&rsquo; freezers and will have vegetable gardens, too. That, along 
with the carpentry and concrete projects should keep them pretty busy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you a snapshot of where we&rsquo;re at; you can use it 
to compare to other commenters&rsquo; age scenarios.</p> 
<p>-5 children, ages 8 to 12 (1 set of twins)</p> 
<p>- We homeschool, which I think is cheaper than the &ldquo;free&rdquo; 
public school. Spend about $500-$600 on curriculum each year, about $200 on 
field trips.</p> 
<p>- Sports, club, etc fees are about $200-$400 year, depending. </p> 
<p>- We budget $600 per month for groceries (including toiletries), $200 per 
month for take-out/restaurants</p> 
<p>- Clothing has been very minimal (esp since they don&rsquo;t go to school), 
but shoe costs are rising as they get older. My girls can&rsquo;t pass down 
shoes as much because their feet are turning out very different. : )</p> 
<p>- Biggest &ldquo;extra&rdquo; cost for our family are road trips &ndash; 
which we value and plan for. Hotels are NOT accomodating to large families; 
with any lodging (camping, etc) we have to get creative. But like I said, this 
is a lifestyle choice for us.</p>
