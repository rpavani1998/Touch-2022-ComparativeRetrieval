Date: 1 Feb 1997 14:09:17 From: Dave Subject: 
Emulsifying wax
<p>About a week ago there was a discussion on Aqueous cream and there were 
some people wondering exactly what was in it; it was found to contain 
emulsifying wax and people wondered what that was... My pharmacist says that 
emulsifying wax contains cetostearyl alcohol and sodium lauryl sulphate (and 
some purified water).</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 09:46:11 From: Debbie Subject: 
Childhood Eczema
<p>Citrus is a common allergen. I've been told that anyone with 
eczema/psoriasis (&quot;Leaky Gut&quot;) should avoid the Nightshades 
(tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers of all kind, and paprika) and to avoid 
foods high in fat (counting whole milk dairy products).</p>
<p>If your child is in fact actually allergic to corn it might be worth 
mentioning that corn products are in a zillion foods--due to corn starch and 
then corn syrup used as a sweetener. My allergy book (&quot;Allergies Made 
Simple&quot; by Phylis Austin, Agatha Thrash, MD, Calvin Thrash, MD). lists 
even things like cough syrup, aspirin, envelopes, stickers, gum, candy, salt, 
paper cups, vinegar..and some toothpastes. The list goes on and on...&nbsp;</p> 
Date: 1 Feb 1997 09:49:53 From: Debbie Subject: non-irritating detergent
<p>I use Bold Free with an extra rinse cycle. You wouldn't believe how much 
more soap comes out of the second rinse !&nbsp;</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 12:17:23 
From: Brigit Subject: Bag Balm
<p>In my experience there is more than one Bag Balm on the market; the name 
seems to have become generic, rather than a brand name. As I write this I have 
at home three different jars of something labelled Udder Cream or Udder 
Ointment: all different, most at least reasonably good.</p>
<p>All were bought at a chemist or pharmacy. </p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 12:45:18 
From: Shelley Subject: How am I today?
<p>I can never say I'm cleared &quot;completely.&quot; The best my skin can be 
is &quot;under control.&quot; And that's where I am right now. I am so grateful 
for the prednisone/antibiotics 1-2 punch that seems to re-set my internal 
computer, and allows me to feel in control again with what I have learned to 
identify as a &quot;normal&quot; level of skin irritation for me; a certain 
amount of rash, open sores, dryness, itchiness, etc. I go crazy when it gets 
worse than that level, but as long as I am able to see direct improvements from 
use of antibacterials, steroid ointments, and moisturizers, I am able to 
tolerate living with this condition.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when you haven't had it very long over your entire body, 
the visual appearance gets so much attention. It's easy to put so much energy 
into how it looks, comparing it to how other people's skin looks, without any 
idea of what is the &quot;normal&quot; way for their skin to look. People with 
eczema have to learn over time how eczema skin looks! It doesn't look like 
other people's skin! And they have to learn over time how it's supposed to feel 
on the inside, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, after 40 years I have learned how to recognize when I can say my 
skin is &quot;good&quot; and it is good right now, but as I'm sure you know, 
&quot;good&quot; is relative for us.</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 08:16:48 From: Steve 
Subject: &quot;All&quot; non-irritating detergent
<p>My dermatologist recommended using ALL's Free and Clear (hypoallergenic) 
version. With double rinsing. Double rinsing always yields suds on with any 
detergent I have tried.</p>
<p>This product is not seen as much as the standard &quot;All&quot; but I am 
sure if you ask your store manager to order it he/she would, as it sells 
easily. As long as you are at it, ask him if he can order the largest bottle 
possible.</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 08:33:43 From: Steve Subject: Betadine for 
reducing bacteria on skin
<p>Betadine is useful for prophylactic skin cleansing. It's main ingredient is 
Iodine. Doctors caution that it might have a drying effect, and should be used 
carefully as should all stuff we put on our skin.</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 14:41:46 
From: Wayne Subject: &quot;Bag balm&quot;
<p>I like Bag Balm because it acts as an emollient and an antiseptic. So, when 
I use the product I'm taking care of two things in one application. In the US 
if you can't get it at a pharmacy, try your local &quot;feed store&quot;, look 
in the yellow pages (phone directory) for an outlet like Southern States. The 
stuff also comes in a small one inch square can if you want to sample.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brigit's right, &quot;bag balm&quot; is a generic term, so there are 
several producers. I can't remember the brand names, but one comes is a green 
can, the other in a yellow can w/ red cap. As far as when to use it, it depends 
on the occasion. It has that healthy barnyard smell. Very different from the 
fishy smell of the Preparation H idea I got off this list. :-)&nbsp;</p> Date: 
1 Feb 1997 18:52:01 From: Donna Subject: Bag Balm
<p>Here in the States, there is only one &quot;Bag Balm&quot;, the brandname 
of one specific product sold in the ubiquitous green can with red roses, put 
out by the Dairy Association Co., Inc. of Lyndonville, Vermont... I'm sure 
there must be other udder creams/ointments on the American market, but only one 
product goes by the name &quot;Bag Balm&quot;...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never seen a yellow can... do you know who makes it, and what 
brandname it uses? (&quot;Bag Balm&quot; is the brandname of the green can... )
</p>
<p>I find Bag Balm has very little smell to it, and what smell it does have I 
find &quot;medicinal&quot;... I only use it at night due to its thickness and 
'stickiness', not due to its smell...</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 22:13:57 From: Ann 
Subject: detergents
<p>I use Tide Free. I use about half the suggested amount. The only time I 
double rinse is when I accidentally add too much detergent. With hot washing 
all the stuff from 3 beds every 2 weeks (plus the curtains and small rugs), I 
take every possible shortcut in the laundry drill!&nbsp;</p> Date: 1 Feb 1997 
23:14:42 From: Steve Subject: detergents
<p>My dermatologist said to avoid Tide. I don't know if he knows about Tide 
Free. I never heard of it either.</p> Date: 2 Feb 1997 09:11:07 From: Alan 
Subject: Denise &amp; Evaporation
<p>I don't use corticosteroids if I can help it. I have been using Curel as a 
moisterizer and an oatmeal soap. I always wear make-up. My skin seems to get 
worse if I don't. It seems to protect it and it keeps me from scratching.</p>
<p>When I wrote the first letter asking about evaporation my face was getting 
pretty bad, along with my hands, forearms, neck, and legs. Right now, and I'm 
not sure why, it is completely, without a trace, gone from my face. My arms and 
hands are much better, too. I started taking B complex last week, and I don't 
know if that's the reason, but I thought I would pass this along just in case.
</p> Date: 2 Feb 1997 17:29:16 From: Wayne Subject: &quot;Bag balm&quot; 
<p>I have used the yellow-can-with-red-lid brand named Dr Naylor Udder Balm, 
made in Morris, New York. The writing on the can says it's a &quot;antiseptic 
ointment for udder and teats&quot;.&nbsp;</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 13:51:03 From: 
Dave Subject: Eye problems: keratoconus
<p>This morning I was diagnosed with KERATOCONUS, which is an eye disorder 
(specifically, the cornea). I mentioned that I had been using topical steroids 
etc and the Opto-wozzizname bloke suggested that it was more likely that it was 
due to the eczema itself than its treatment, although the steroids may have 
aggravated the situation. He says that the asthma-eczema-hay fever-keratoconus 
connection is &quot;quite common&quot;.</p>
<p>I have years of wearing weird-shaped contact lenses and the prospect of a 
possible cornea transplant to look forward to. Lucky old me.</p> Date: 3 Feb 
1997 15:09:45 From: Dave Subject: Emulsifying wax
<p>If emulsifying wax contains &quot;cetostearyl alcohol and sodium lauryl 
sulphate (and some purified water)&quot;, then this makes aqueous cream sound 
almost *exactly* like Diprobase! I think those were the two missing ingredients 
that Diprobase had that Aqueous Cream &quot;didn't&quot;. So, it turns out that 
Diprobase, cost GBP 12.50 for 500g contains exactly the same ingredients 
(possibly in different proportions, admittedly) as Aqueous Cream, cost GBP 2.50 
for 500g.</p>
<p>And there you have it. </p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 10:39:07 From: Heather 
Subject: Eye problems: keratoconus
<p>Dave, I'm sorry to hear about your eye troubles. What exactly is 
keratoconus? Had you been using topical steroids on your face, or just on your 
body? Do keep us posted, and I wish you luck with the necessary treatments.</p> 
Date: 3 Feb 1997 11:49:42 From: Brigit Subject: recipe, pls
<p>I've embarked on a wheat-free, dairy-free, egg-free elimination diet. </p>
<p>As this is not for life, just for a month, I expect to be able to keep it 
up; the only real problem I have is in finding something to eat for 
breakfast/lunch. Bread is out; cheese is out; yoghurt is out; eggies are out-- 
so here's my question:</p>
<p>Does anyone have a quick&amp;simple recipe for corn-based pancakes (no 
eggs, no milk, no wheat)? Rye is out, too, but all other grains are OK. It has 
to be quick&amp;easy, so that I can bake a bunch and freeze them in for use 
instead of bread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a pack of gluten-free bread mix, but the stuff is horrible. There 
is no way I can stand it for a whole month...&nbsp;</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 
11:49:40 From: Brigit Subject: ultravate
<p>Please, can anyone help me solve a riddle from the archives: </p>
<p>It's about something called Ultravate. In some posts, this is described as 
a non-steroid ointment made by Westwood Squibb and containing halobetasol 
propionate; in others it's referred to as a strong steroid cream!</p>
<p>Are there perhaps TWO different things with the same name? </p> Date: 3 Feb 
1997 12:35:41 From: Shelley Subject: Antibacterial Lotion &amp; Soap
<p>I have been on a hunt for a new moisturizing lotion similar to Shepard's, 
but cheaper. So far I've experimented with Eucerin, Jergen's Dual Healing, 
Lubriderm, and Shi Kai, all because I was able to get sample sizes of them. 
They were all OK, not great.</p>
<p>The sample that I am now trying seems the best so far: Keri Anti-Bacterial 
Hand Lotion. I like the fact that it is an antiseptic and a moiturizer 
together, since I need both. My skin drinks it quickly and so far has no 
reaction to it, either immediately or over time. But I'm giving it more time 
before I buy a large size.</p>
<p>I also just bought tea tree oil soap to see if I can benefit from the 
antibacterial effects of that too. I was talking to a pharmacist who said that 
it would be good to rotate using various kinds of antibacterials (like 
Betadine, Hibiclens, etc.) in order to keep bacteria from getting resistant. So 
I am creating an arsenal of antibacterials. Since I started emphasizing the 
antibacterials, I am less itchy.</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 10:40:21 From: Marilyn 
Subject: Coffee
<p>I talked about coffee inhibiting homeopathic remedies. If you're not doing 
homeopathy, don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Interestingly it's not the caffeine that nullifies the remedy, it's coffee. 
I can drink tea and eat chocolate but I can't do even decaf coffee, or a coffee 
nip.</p>
<p>No one knows why. </p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 13:27:43 From: Wendy Subject: Eye 
problems: keratoconus
<p>I don't know if this is related but for as long as I have had eczema (about 
1 1/2 yrs) I have been getting conjunctivitis and blepharitis. I just went to 
the eye doctor last week and asked if there was any connection. He said no and 
that topical steroids do not affect the eye itself. He said long term use of 
steroid drops (which I have been using for the infections) can eventually cause 
glaucoma. Just thought this was interesting.</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 13:12:47 
From: Royce Subject: Coffee &amp; homepathic remedies
<p>I know that you're not supposed to drink coffee when taking homeopathic 
remedies. By the way, I was told that the homeopathic medicated pellets 
Thyrodium, Graphites, Sepia &amp; Sulphur are supposed to be good for eczema. 
Has anyone had any luck with these?</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 13:02:18 From: Patsy 
Subject: recipe, pls
<p>Brigit- Can you find tortillas there? Crepes? You might need to look at 
some bread alternatives while you undertake your &quot;starve and the eczema 
will go away&quot; diet. Good luck, and let us know how things go.&nbsp;</p> 
Date: 3 Feb 1997 14:19:22 From: Heather Subject: ultravate and diet
<p>The Ultravate I have here is manufactured by Westwood-Squibb and contains 
halobetasol propionate .05% ; I assume that it's pretty powerful because it can 
clear up my lips in one application.</p>
<p>I tried a wheat- and dairy-free diet once, though I still ate eggs. You 
might enjoy cornmeal mush (polenta) for breakfast; just get some water boiling, 
and add cornmeal, stirring quickly with a whisk until it thickens. Are you 
eliminating soy, malt and rice as well? If not, you could put soy or rice milk 
in it, as you would with oatmeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fry sliced mush leftovers on a greased griddle to make 
&quot;pancakes&quot;. Rice flour makes good muffins (though rugged), and you 
can use soy flour in place of eggs in baked goods; just use 1 heaping tbsp. of 
soy flour and 1 tbsp. water for each egg (add flour to dry ingredients and 
water to wet; don't mix the soy and water together by themselves, because 
you'll just get a brown paste!)</p>
<p>Have you seen mochi in a natural foods store or Japanese market? It's a 
glutinous rice cake that you can bake in the oven; makes a hearty, sticky bun 
with a crust. Make sure it's rice-only, if you're trying to avoid other grains.
</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 12:26:50 From: Kim Subject: Childhood Eczema (To Debbie, 
esp.)
<p>Debbie, Thanks for the reply, he was a little worse this a.m. with lots of 
itching in the night, even spots that don't look bad, the back of his knees 
always itch at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't eat any corn, I make our bread and we eat almost no premade food. 
I did some natural chicken broth for soup and I think it had paprika so maybe I 
am on the right track. Are you the one that said earler that yams are not in 
the nightshade family, he eats them a lot (not sweet potatoes).&nbsp;</p> Date: 
3 Feb 1997 16:02:11 From: Marilyn Subject: recipe, pls/red wine
<p>I have been a vegetarian, and occasional vegan, for years. For any who want 
to try this, let me suggest a few books:</p>
<p>All of John A. McDougall's books are vegan (no egg, no dairy). They include 
The McDougall Program, and the McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss, and 
at least 2 books of recipe collections. A good portion of these books review 
the health benefits of the diets, and include simple and quick recipes... lots 
of tips for substitutions. The recipes are pretty generic, and include lots of 
canned foods, frozen juices, and vegetables (of course)... they are not all to 
my taste, but for day-to-day cuisine, quite satisfying.</p>
<p>&quot;Eat More, Weigh Less&quot; - Dean Ornish, MD. Another pep talk on the 
health benefits of very low fat vegan cookery. The recipes in this one are a 
collection from various chefs -- they can be quite elaborate, but are very 
good. Great suggestions for the more gourmet palate... and lots of sauce and 
stock recommendations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Single Vegan&quot; -- Leah Leneman. This is a British cookbook 
(Thorson's Publishing Group), and I have not seen it in the US for years! I 
love this book --- it organizes recipes for one by week, complete with weekly 
shopping lists. The daily recipes take only about 30 minutes to prepare... the 
Sunday meal takes a little longer. The food is plain, but quite good -- I 
resort to this book when I haven't got the time to think about cooking. Added 
benefit: my grocery bills go *way* down.</p>
<p>&quot;Vegan Cooking&quot; -- Eva Batt... another Thorsons title. Very 
utilitarian, well tested recipes... but this and the Leneman book use higher 
fat ingredients, and lots of nuts. Here's a pancake recipe for Brigit:</p>
<p>Pancake or Fritter Mixture </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 12 fl oz water&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 4 1/2 oz plain flour (or whole wheat, corn, or any other ground 
meal)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 3 rounded teaspoons soya flour&nbsp;</li> 
<li> Pinch sea salt&nbsp;</li> 
<li> Vegetable oil for frying.</li> </ul> Put water into blender, switch on 
and add dry ingredients gradually. Whiz for about 1 minute. Leave in cool place 
for at least 1 hour. (Can be left in refrigerator overnight.)
<p>Beat again just before using. (If required for fritters use only 8 fl oz 
water)</p>
<p>Fry on both sides in very lightly oiled pan and serve while hot with lemon 
juice and fruit sugar or syrup.</p>
<p>Footnote: I feel much better on a vegan regime, but don't use it 
frequently. The eczema is a new problem for me. I have tried several of the 
supplements and creams suggested by this list, and my condition has improved 
considerably. Now that I am on my second week sans red wine, however, I have 
soft skin again on my hands-- imagine! Real skin! No cracks, no redness, and 
complete feeling!</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 14:33:32 From: Marilyn Subject: Coffee 
&amp; homepathic remedies
<p>My understanding is that homopathy treats the person, not the disease. In 
my history I have successfully treated eczema and my repetitive stress injury 
with one remedy, Rhus Tox. Now it doesn't touch my eczema but Phosphorus is 
doing really well against it so far. Also, Lycopodium has been successful for 
me.</p>
<p>But I'm never given two remedies at the same time. And I *go* to the 
homeopath. I don't do it over the counter.</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 17:33:05 From: 
Karen Subject: Childhood Eczema (To Debbie, esp.)
<p>Kim, Have you considered having your son tested for allergies? We just had 
our 2-1/2-year-old tested. We already suspected an allergy to cow's milk and 
had been feeding her soy formula. Turns out she was allergic to that, too. One 
week later, with soy eliminated from her diet, and her drinking Carnation Good 
Start (regular) Baby Formula and a nondairy product called Vitamite, her skin 
is completely clear! :+)</p>
<p>We had tried elimination diets in the past but these were unsuccessful 
since she is allergic to so many different foods. Perhaps your son has a 
similar problem?</p>
<p>My only regret about the allergy testing is not having it done sooner. </p> 
Date: 3 Feb 1997 21:42:36 From: Cheri Subject: Eye problems: keratoconus
<p>Dave, you certainly seem to be taking it well. Does it hurt, itch, look red 
or can it be seen or felt at all? I am so sorry - I trust you have the strength 
to deal with this? It seems that we always do when it comes down to it. Stay in 
touch - the support is so strong here. What's the next step in keeping it 
manageable?</p> Date: 3 Feb 1997 21:55:46 From: Cheri Subject: Antibacterial 
Lotion &amp; Soap
<p>Me too, Shelley. Except putting Alpha-Keri bath stuff is like lighting a 
match next to me. Yet, the antibacterial stuff works really well, as long as I 
don't forget the Nivea skin conditioning oil. When I put that on, I can almost 
hear my skin gulping it down.</p>
<p>My daughter sent me some 2oz sizes of stuff called Purell instant hand 
sanitizer: &quot;Kills 99.9% of most common disease-causing GERMS within 15 
seconds&quot;. Could it be that this beastly stuff is also killing the dust 
mites or neutralizing the &quot;mite-poop&quot; or something? I'm surprised I 
can bear it, since the thing is 62% ethyl alcohol. Geez, that's almost all 
that's in it! Just that and water, isopropyl alcohol, &quot;emollients&quot; 
and &quot;thickener&quot;. Maybe my skin's not so hyper dry and weak after all 
-- maybe if I just swab the deck more often, I'd be okay without all the gloves 
and vaseline routines.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 00:35:20 From: Ed Subject: Eye 
problems: keratoconus
<p>I'm one of those opto-wozzisname blokes, so I can fill this in some. 
Keratoconus is a deformity of the cornea (the eye's surface layer). The cornea 
is responsible for about two-thirds of the eye's focusing power. In 
keratoconus, because of the corneal irregularity, light rays entering the eye 
are bent in odd ways, which blurs the image and reduces the sharpness of vision.
</p>
<p>It has previously been discussed in this forum that the potential ocular 
complications of steroids include cataract and glaucoma. For those of you using 
steroids, you shouldn't sweat this one - I don't think of steroids as causing 
keratoconus, but there is some association with atopy (asthma-eczema-hay fever).
</p>
<p>For Dave, however, understand that this is a very treatable eye condition. 
If the distortion is great enough that spectacles will no longer be adequate, 
the mainstay of treatment is to wear hard contact lenses (they must be hard 
lenses - I suspect they will want to fit you with a gas permeable hard lens). 
Hard lenses do not really alter the shape of the cone. Rather, the hard lens 
surface effectively becomes the new surface for the eye, and the area between 
the hard lens and your own cornea fills in with tears. Since the hard lens 
surface is smooth and regular, the blur is eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be a little tricky to fit a keratoconus patient with contact lenses, 
but it is almost always possible. Corneal transplantation is only needed if the 
cornea is so badly deformed that it is impossible to fit a contact lens, or if 
there is scarring due to the keratoconus that obscures the central vision - 
that is clearly the minority of patients. If needed, however, corneal 
transplantation for keratoconus carries about a 90%-ish success rate - it is 
one of the diseases that we do pretty well with when performing transplants. If 
you wish to learn more, you should find a discussion of keratoconus in most 
standard ophthalmic texts - it is not a rare disease.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 
05:39:38 From: Brigit Subject: recipe
<p>Thanks for the breakfast suggestions. Real meals are not much of a problem, 
as I'm a decent cook and work from scratch anyhow (very little ready-made stuff 
in my food ever); so I just choose things without cheese, cream and eggs. No 
really big deal, as meat is OK. (Lovely lamb casserole tonight, yummy yummy.)
</p>
<p>I will certainly try the pancake recipe. The mush idea I'd stumbled on 
already, what I'd done is mix 1 measure of corn flour with 2 measures of 
boiling water and a dash of walnut oil, then bake in the oven for about half an 
hour, then cut up in cubes. It's surprisingly good, firm but moist, and I can 
see how herbs and spices would make it different every time.</p> Date: 4 Feb 
1997 06:44:35 From: John Subject: ultravate
<p>I just got a tube of Ultravate. The enclosure says it's a steroid - my Dr 
said I would like it, that it was stronger than the Beta-Val I was using.</p>
<p>I don't see a difference on me. I really only have eczema on my hands, 
mostly, and I prefer B-V to the Ultravate. B-V is a cream, while Ultraval is an 
ointment, kind of like vaseline. My preference is only because the cream is a 
little less &quot;messier&quot;. They both seem to do the trick, however.</p>
<p>My eczema looks great right now - no angry, itching patches, no cracks I 
have had to glue just a few rough patches of skin.</p>
<p>I have been using B-V, Ultravate &amp; zinc oxide, on an informal, rotating 
basis to calm everything down. Haven't even needed the hot water trick for 
itching in the past week or so.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm not altogether sure it was the medicine that calmed me down - 
maybe just a &quot;quiet cycle&quot;. When my eczema is really active, the 
medicine, while it DOES help, doesn't calm it down the way it looks right now.
</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 12:21:39 From: David Subject: recipe, pls 
<p>Brigit, sounds to me that you need some plain chocolate (some plain 
chocolate has milk in, but the best doesn't). Now melt that over some corn 
flakes -- I think I could well live on that for a month... but I am a signed up 
chocaholic...&nbsp;</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 07:59:12 From: David Subject: 
Emulsifying wax
<p>I once asked a pharmacist and he looked it up and decided Diprobase and 
aqueous cream were the same, possibly whipped up to a slightly different 
consistency.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 13:24:48 From: Dave Subject: Eye problems: 
keratoconus
<p>The ophthalmologist reckoned that the general set of symptoms asthma, 
eczema, hay fever were not uncommon in people who suffer from keratoconus, and 
he implied some unknown root cause which probably leads to all of them. I 
mentioned that I had been using topical steroids on my hands and arms and 
occasionally around my eyes, but that I had stopped when I read about 
&quot;alleged&quot; effects these had on eyes based on something I read on this 
list. He thought that it was unlikely that the steroids would *cause* the 
keratoconus, but that it might aggravate it, simply because steroids thin the 
skin etc.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 11:07:16 From: Debbie Subject: Childhood Eczema 
(To Kim, esp.)
<p>You're right, yams are not in the nightshade family. Neither are sweet 
potatoes, so I've been told.</p>
<p>Regarding the antibiotic cause/trigger: I've read that antibiotics are 
rough on the stomach, particularly in an allergic person. With Leaky Gut, it is 
said that constant bombardment of allergens can cause the Leaky Gut or the 
porous walls may &quot;cause&quot; the allergies. It goes either way. But then 
becomes a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Now, supposedly, there is a connection with certain misalignments of the 
spine (don't remember if I've mentioned this before). We've taken Julia to 3 
chiropractor appts. so far. On the first visit he said she was extremely tight 
in the area of the spine that corresponds with stomach and liver. At the second 
visit he said she responded really well (stayed pretty loosened up--apparently 
it usually takes some retraining of the spine before it stays in the right 
place). Since the 2nd visit she's been eating better again. He said it will 
help her stomach area for sure, whether it helps her eczema he's not sure... 
but agrees it's quite possible if the stomach is the cause of her eczema.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we've once again been using a slight amount of topical 
cortisone behind the knees (knees and neck often keep her itching all night) 
and a dose of antihistamine. I needed to resort to some drugs for some instant 
relief as she was very sick with croup and getting worse because she wasn't 
sleeping at all due to itching. Before this though we hadn't used cortisone or 
Benadryl since Aug. (tried 2 homeopathic remedies instead, one she's still 
on).&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's never had a clear day since she got eczema at 2 wks. old, whether on 
drugs or not. Now my philosophy (this week, anyway) is to use drugs for an 
emergency but to still continue all prevention measures and keep pursuing 
original cause(s). I really do believe the drugs just suppress the immune 
system and I want her immune system to find its on way to heal itself, so I 
don't want to overuse them. I really want to avoid messing up her immune system 
even more and possibly contracting other auto-immune diseases. Homeopathic 
routes can just take an awfully long time sometimes, especially for a baby who 
can't speak for itself.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 11:36:03 From: Killeen Subject:

Date: 4 Feb 1997 13:42:05 From: Shelley Subject: drug ingredients &amp; prices
<p>Yes, it's interesting how the drug companies mix and match ingredients and 
come up with a wide range of prices that don't seem to correlate to what's 
actually included. We have to become educated consumers and unfortunately waste 
time investigating these ingredients to see if there are actually cheaper 
sources for the same stuff. I am in the process of researching antibacterial 
lotions and soaps and am finding the same phenomenon of very similar 
ingredients with a wide range of prices.&nbsp;</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 13:27:10 
From: Royce Subject: Childhood Eczema
<p>I am so happy to hear that you're trying not to use drugs on your daughter. 
I agree that they suppress the immune system. When I was a child I took so much 
medicine for my allergies, eczema and a chronic allergic bronchitis (I had a 
deep mucousy horrible cough which I never found out the cause of but it went 
away as mysteriously as it came). I think I ended up paying for the use of all 
that medication I took as a child; I am now allergic to all oral antibiotics 
(can't take any without getting violently ill and breaking out in hives). If I 
have to take any medication I was told to take acidophilus because it helps to 
build up the friendly bacteria that the antibiotics kill. That may help to 
build up Julia's system too.</p>
<p>I used to get eczema behind my knees, inside my elbows and on my neck only, 
now it can appear anywhere at all (except I never had the problem with my 
hands). I watch what I eat (basically stay away from starch or high 
carbohydrate foods, citric acid, yeast, nuts, most cheeses (I'm allergic to 
mold) and fermented foods (including vinegar) although sweet potatoes &amp; 
yams don't bother me.</p>
<p>For the itching, have you tried evaporation at night or zinc oxide. My 
dermatologist put me on prednisone last month because the eczema was so severe. 
It cleared me up in 2 days but as I started to wean off the medication my 
eczema started up all over again. It wasn't until I started using zinc oxide 
ointment, evaporation and Zinc Pyrithione 2% (SKIN-CAP) Spray that it started 
to clear up and stop itching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These 3 things have helped tremendously. I use them every day on any 
affected areas and it seems to help it heal and keep it from coming back. 
Sometimes I take the antihistamine Zyrtec (it's non-drowsy). I also use 
Theraplex emollient and clear lotion as moisturizers and sometimes vitamin E 
oil. There's not too much I can use that won't irritate my skin but these 
moisturizers definitely have helped me. I have used cortisone cream for twenty 
some odd years and I am so happy to have something else that I can use in place 
of it (at least most of the time). The overuse of these steroids caused atrophy 
(at least that's what I think it is) on my neck (the skin is smooth but it's 
discolored -it looks like dark lines).</p>
<p>As we all know everyone is different; unfortunately no one thing will help 
us all. I hope the chiropractor etc. helps to prevent the eczema. I will be 
looking out for any messages you may send on your progress. Julia is very lucky 
to have someone who cares so much about her.&nbsp;</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 
20:24:44 From: Karen Subject: Coffee &amp; homepathic remedies/valerian and TCP
<p>Coffee is a homeopathic remedy in its own right and often used for 
insomnia. My homeo-doc told me that - like mint - it just happened to be 
particularly potent and would overwhelm any less robust substance. I would not 
be at all surprised if either substance provoked strong allergic reactions too.
</p>
<p>Fingers crossed, but I'm &quot;in remission&quot; at the moment. I have no 
scrupulous scientific evidence, but I have a suspicion this is down to taking 
valerian to aid sleep (I've taken everything and this WORKS!) and liberal 
applications of TCP to deal with a recent bout of folliculitis. TCP is 
phenol-based and I imagine you can get it in the US. The more I deal with this, 
the more convinced I am of the bacterial/fungal connection plus stress.</p>
<p>I'm no doctor but I often feel we will find one day that eczema is just the 
skin's way of reacting to a number of things the body doesn't like and has no 
consistent cause. And I think the evidence built up by all you good people out 
there will one day give us all the answer.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 17:15:12 From: 
Anil Subject: Coffee and homeopathic remedies
<p>I've been on homeopathic graphites and sulphur for about three weeks now 
(no coffee, and no caffeine for good measure!). Things were going well, the 
eczema on my legs had stopped oozing, the rest of my body was not noticeable, 
no itching to speak of. Then last Thursday I was on a home visit and had drunk 
a cup of coffee before I realised what I'd done. I thought, 'oh well, in for a 
penny... ' and had two more cups later in the day.</p>
<p>I had no sleep that night at all, I was itching so badly. Even the cold 
water/damp sheet didn't work, and it usually does. Since then all of my eczema 
has been burning (it feels better today though).</p>
<p>I also got a new kitten on Saturday, so maybe that has something to do with 
it. But I'm loathe to have coffee again as I think my improvement might be 
partly due to giving it up.</p>
<p>I think I might be doing this wrong too, then! I have a friend who's a 
homeopath, so I asked her what might be good to use, and she suggested those 
remedies, so I tried them both together. I might drop one and see what happens. 
In the past she recommended euphrasia when my eyes kept watering for no 
apparent reason, and that worked really well. But I suppose eczema is a bigger 
problem.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997 20:13:22 From: Lorena Subject: Antibacterial

<p>My eczema covers both of my hands (but nowhere else). I have two young

anti-bacterial lotion really makes my hands break out bad!!! What a 
dissappointment. I am sensitive to most lotions and find it hard to find some 
type of moisturizer than won't &quot;burn&quot; my skin. Eucerin cream has 
worked about the best so far but it gets so greasy.</p> Date: 4 Feb 1997

Date: 5 Feb 1997 15:36:55 From: Rita Subject: Child Eczema
<p>I'm glad to report that my expedition helped my Jodi a whole lot. ( She has 
been suffering from E since she was 3 weeks old and will be 11 months in a 
week.) We were in China getting her Chinese Herbal Treatment. Everyday, I 
brewed a big bag of herbal mix with 48 oz of water and reduced it into 6 oz of 
decoction. She didn't like the bitter taste but got used to it soon enough. The 
dr checked her pulse, skin, tongue etc every day and changed the herbal mix as 
needed. He also prescribed herbs to be brewed for bathing her. During the whole 
time when she was taking the decoction, no emollient was allowed.</p>
<p>Jodi's diagnosis was toxins in the blood. The herbs were said to cleanse 
the toxins and expell them through the skin and intestines via her bowel 
movements. The first 2 weeks her skin weeped so much I was really worried. But 
since I was warned by the dr about such a reaction, I was prepared to take on 
the shock. Then, starting on the 3rd week, her eczematic skin turned from 
red-inflamed-hard-weepy-acne-like to soft and dry. She looked happy and 
comfortable from within. She smiled a lot and interacted with people around 
her. She slept much better and had very good appetite. She was no longer the 
little baby who scratched and scratched and scratched some more. I had tried 
Chinese Herbal Treatment on her before when western medicine had failed her but 
the results had never been so successful. I came back with a full luggage of 
herbal mixes and just finished them all not too long ago.</p>
<p>Since our return, nothing has worked in her favor. It's so cold, even when 
I turn my heater down to minimal, it's still very drying indoors. It became 
difficult not to use emollient. (You see, there is no indoor heat in China.) 
Then, she had a viral attack. Blisters first developed on her lips and perhaps 
through her hands somehow got onto her right cheek. Imagine blisters over 
eczematic skin. It was horrible. [Ann, I can now empathize with your full body 
herpes infection. It must have been really hard on you.] Thank god the topical 
antibiotic stopped it from spreading to other areas. No systemic antibiotic or 
steroid was needed, else, it would have contradicted her herbal treatment. When 
the last piece of the ugly scabs fell off her face with no signs of scarring, I 
went out and brought a lottery ticket.(Didn't win, never get that kind of luck!)
</p>
<p>Then, the Aveeno Oatmeal Bath... a disaster. Jodi developed full body 
contact dermatitis. Once again, it proves everybody's eczema is different. She 
seems to recover from the Aveeno Bath just today and I'm definitely not trying 
anything new on her for a while.</p>
<p>Right now, this is what I'm doing for Jodi: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Alimentum formula (I believe in the leaky gut theory)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> solid food like rice, yam, lean pork, apple, pear, rice cereal, Chinese 
leafy green vegetables(only available in China town)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> tea tree oil ointment for dry and chapped skin</li> 
<li> Aquaphor and Eucerin after baths</li> 
<li> borage oil taken orally</li> 
<li> an herbal extract drink (with 23 herbal extracts) taken orally 1 oz a day
</li> 
<li> double wash cycle on clothes</li> 
<li> fight dust mites</li> 
<li> leather and wood, no drapes, no carpet, clean mattress</li> 
<li> short nails, 100% silky cotton mittens at night</li> 
<li> 100% cotton clothes</li> 
<li> wash hair everyday [BTW, Jodi perspires profusely on her skull at night.]
</li> 
<li> drink lots of water</li> </ul> I'm still keeping my eyes on the eczema 
vaccine. I'll find out if it's for real.
<p>Would anyone please advise on handling sibling jealousy? My 28 months is 
getting quite jealous lately. Anything Jodi has she wants too. My husband and I 
try to maintain a one-on-one situation whenever possible. It's just that Jodi 
and her eczema gets more attention at times.</p> Date: 5 Feb 1997 17:47:23

07:02:49 From: Karen Subject: Childhood Eczema
<p>Hi Kim, So sorry your son's allergy testing didn't produce more definitive 
results. One more thought: He didn't happen to be on any antihistamines in his 
system at the time of testing, did he? Our allergist gave us a long list of 
medications (antihistamines and others) that our daughter was not to use for at 
least one week prior to testing, as use of certain meds can alter test results.
</p>
<p>It's so frustrating trying to find a cause and treatment for this horrible 
condition. I keep telling myself things could be lots worse, though. At least 
eczema isn't life-threatening.</p>
<p>Hang in there. Perhaps the next allergy testing session will produce some 
answers.</p> Date: 6 Feb 1997 12:52:40 From: Royce Subject: scalp 
<p>Hi. This sounds kind of disgusting but I figure that this is the place to 
go for some good advice on this subject. I have eczema on my scalp; it's falky 
and scabby and I can't get rid of it. I've tried DHS Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo, 
Nizorol Shampoo, tar shampoos &amp; Derma Smooth (which is an oil based 
cortisone solution which, in the past, has helped the eczema on my skin).</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a good remedy for an itchy, flaky, scabby eczema scalp

1997 17:04:07 From: Gary Subject: scalp
<p>I have found success with Long's Drugs Scalp Itch Treatment lotion. It is 
marketed under other names also and contains: 1.0% hydrocortizone, menthol, 
propylene glycol, and SD 40 alcohol. Recently, when I ran out of hydrocortizone 
cream I put this on my face and it acted MUCH MORE effectively there than the 
cream--practically the &quot;magic bullet&quot; for MY facial eczema. I can't 
imagine why this simple concoction would be so much more effective than one of 
the over-the-counter creams, but it is.</p> Date: 6 Feb 1997 22:09:16 From: Ann 
Subject: scalp
<p>Royce, I have had good results with T-Gel shampoo by Neutragena (leave it 
on scalp for a few minutes before rinsing, and do a second application if you 
have time). It really helps control the flakey, powdery areas for me. But if 
the scalp is inflamed or has sores and scabs, I need steroids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My derm doctor told me that scalp eczema is different from other eczema in 
that the scalp needs to be kept DRY (not oily). Therefore, he gave me an 
alcohol based steroid for the scalp (I think it was called textacort). It's 
hard to believe that ANY type of eczema benefits from a drying agent, but the 
stuff helped me. I eventually went back to just using ointment on the bad spots 
(I have absolutely no oil in my scalp so I don't think the drying effect is 
real important for me) but it might help you to get away from the oily meds. 
Scalp sores and cracks take FOREVER to heal; I have had individual scalp hives 
that lasted for many weeks!&nbsp;</p> Date: 7 Feb 1997 07:55:19 From: Theodore 
Subject: scalp
<p>When I got eczema on my scalp it was weeping so the dermatologist gave me 
some prescription medication that was a steroid concoction suspended in 
alcohol. After that ran out I bought some Dry Scalp Head and Shoulders. The 
little bit of itchy, flaky eczema that I had left was cleared up using the 
shampoo. This took a couple of months of use to clear up, but I haven't had any 
of the eczema return and it is the middle of winter around here and the rest of 
my skin is flaring up from the dry, cold air. Hope this helps.</p> Date: 7 Feb

<p>Shelley, just a word of caution with hibiclens. They supply the soap 
dispensers at the hospital with hibiclens and it is murder on my eczema so if 
you need it for anti-bacterial cleansing I would not use it daily if you can 
avoid it. A lot of my co-workers cannot use it either and they don't have 
eczema. It is so drying.</p> Date: 7 Feb 1997 17:59:35 From: Anil Subject: scalp
<p>Royce, I've had this same problem. Nizoral did help for a while, but then 
stopped working. At the moment my scalp is very good, not even dandruffy. It 
seems to be that way due to a combination of Camille Albane deep cleansing 
shampoo and dandruff controlling shampoo (both Avon products) and Pantene 
Shampoo/Conditioner for dandruff. I use the deep cleansing shampoo first, then 
either of the others. I only began using this stuff when I gave up on finding 
anything else to help (the tar preparations did nothing). I thought I might at 
least smell decent! I can't promise they'll help you, but they seem to have 
done the trick for me.</p>
<p>I also remember my mum using olive oil on my scalp eczema when I was 
younger. She used to warm it up, then rub it into my scalp, then leave it on 
for about an hour. After that she'd shampoo it. I presume it did some good (but 
I can't remember for sure).</p> Date: 7 Feb 1997 17:48:34 From: Shelley 
Subject: sibling rivalry
<p>That was an excellent suggestion to get the other child involved with 
caring for the one with eczema. That way they both get the attention they need.
</p>
<p>One of my older sisters was just talking to me about how she remembered 
helping to care for my eczema and how that made her feel special and at the 
same time close to me. And I had a similar experience with helping one of my 
younger sisters who had really bad asthma. I will never forget how important it 
made me feel to know that I was capable of helping someone else and also 
instilled a value in helping others which is a large part of my character.</p>
<p>I highly recommend getting all siblings involved to whatever degree 
possible. And make it fun, not just an awful serious chore. Allow the kids to 
bring their natural playfulness into the experience.</p> Date: 7 Feb 1997

<p>Julia is doing extremely well!!! The best--by far---since when she was 3 
mos. old (when it was all just starting up). She'll be a year old this weekend. 
She's had 4 visits w/ the chiropractor in the last 2 weeks. He says she's doing 
amazingly well, that kids often respond/heal much faster than adults. Said it 
probably would have taken an adult who was that bad a good 3 mos. to get to the 
same point. Anyway, I can't even believe my eyes. No itching in 8 days. Six 
nights in a row of no itching. Haven't changed the sheets all week... I've even 
given her some of the suspect foods (mainly because she begs and screams so I 
thought I'd try again!). No reaction. Chiropractor says to expect a couple more 
quick bouts before healing. But at any rate I'm real hopeful now. But this 
whole thing sounds logical to me. He explained that the misalignment probably 
did happen at birth--after all, she was 10 lbs. 7 oz. and had a broken collar 
bone. So, why not a misalignment too? She started breaking out BAD (as acne, 
etc.) right away at 2 weeks and just got progressively worse and evolved into 
&quot;eczema.&quot;</p>
<p>Still haven't been to the Ped. GI yet. Feel like I may need to bring photos 
to show him instead!</p>
<p>I'm feeling euphoric (it's probably also due to finally sleeping!). I have

<p>Just this morning I made buckwheat barley pancakes: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 1 cup barley flour&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1/2 cup buckwheat flour&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1/4 tsp salt&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 and a half tsp baking powder&nbsp;</li> 
<li> approximately 1 cup water, more if the batter's too thick.</li> 
<li> Sugar, molasses or honey to taste</li> </ul> But, why not eat oatmeal for 
breakfast? If you hate it cooked, try it soaked briefly in soy milk or hot 
water, and spiked with dried fruits and nuts, i.e., make your own muesli.
<p>As long as we're talking about breakfast, I've been eating an immune 
support cereal for 2 or 3 months that I think has kicked me back into health. 
(I no longer sleep with socks sewn to the ends of my pj's to keep from itching. 
I don't really itch. I've been waiting to say this because I don't want to 
encourage a relapse by bragging.)</p>
<p>Who knows exactly what is helping the most. I am staying away from wheat, 
dairy and eggs, too, but here is my cereal.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 4 cups grain flakes, usually oats&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 2 cups oat bran&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 cup soy lecithin&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 cup ground flax seeds&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 cup ground milk thistle seeds</li> </ul> Mix, store in the fridge, and 
let soak in hot water for half an hour before eating. I add all kinds of dried 
fruit and nuts for variety. I believe the milk thistle are a boon, as they help 
to repair the liver.&nbsp;
<p>My theory about my body is that after 20 years of using topical steroids, 
and 6 weeks of using oral ones last summer (to combat the flare I caused by 
quitting the topicals cold turkey), my liver wanted to speak its mind and did 
so through my skin. My herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs 
the liver. After investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests 
and every other possible natural cure, I think they are it. Good, that is. And 
good luck to all who try this.</p> Date: 9 Feb 1997 19:02:47 From: Amy Subject:

<p>I don't think many remedy shampoos work once the eczema digs into your

one thing that helps is putting jojoba oil on it. Jojoba oil is very expensive, 
but some health food places sell it in bulk, and you don't need very much.</p>

<ol> 
<li> There's a Web site where you can &quot;Search for the pharmaceutical of

http://www.rxmed.com/prescribe.html. I tried it on a few items; many of the 
&quot;official&quot; ones (Eucerin, Lac-Hydrin, Aveeno, Eurax etc.) are there, 
but the &quot;alternative&quot; health-food store ones (Simicort, Herpacine) 
are not.</li> 
<li> Can anyone confirm or invalidate my suspicion that the &quot;special 
ingredient&quot; in Eucerin, which is Eucerit, is also in good old Nivea cream? 
All I can find about Eucerit is that it's a special form of lanolin/wool wax 
alcohol. No idea what's so special about it.</li>

<ol> 
<li> I tried Semi-cort because a few people said that it worked wonders. I

which is not the greatest for my skin) so I can't use it for a long period of 
time. I switch off with cortisones, zinc oxide ointment and zinc pyrithione 2%. 
Has anyone else had any luck with Semi-cort?</li> 
<li> I can't use Nivea or Eucerin so maybe it does have at least one of the

Subject: Eczema &amp; wedding dress: need support!
<p>I'm getting married in August, and my grandmother has asked me if I would 
like to have her make my dress. I'm thrilled, but I don't like this feeling of 
shame that I have regarding my eczema. It's not weeping; it just looks like 
patchy, dry red spots. I do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse 
during winter and during certain times of the month), but I *can't stand* the 
looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it. My mother 
always has a new theory about why it flares up, and other people ask why it 
hasn't gone away, etc. I know that they love me and want to see me well, but I 
don't want them to bring it up. There's a tremendous lack of eczema information 
out there, I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to know if anyone can empathize with what I'm 
feeling. I don't know what condition my eczema will be in on the day of the 
wedding, so that has limited my choices of dress styles (I don't trust my 
back/arm eczema enough to wear a sleeveless dress with a low back, but then 
co-workers ask my why I would want to wear a dress with short sleeves in hot 
weather, etc.). I've also felt painfully self-conscious in the bridal salons 
I've been in, worried that the sales assistant was looking at the spots on my 
arms.</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 11:09:37 From: Patsy Subject: Eczema &amp; wedding

<p>Heather- for all people who ask terribly personal and 
none-of-their-business questions, I would respond, &quot;Why in the world would 
you want to know that?&quot; This works especially well in public places if 
said in a slightly louder than normal voice. For some reason, it seems to make 
them realize they are poking their noses...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eczema is just a part of who you are, and you are certainly more than 
eczema (one would assume your beloved didn't make his decision to propose based 
on how much you itch!). None of us would have selected this condition if given 
our druthers, but this is what we've got. I'd say that eczema will be the least 
of your problems once you're married, but then I'm divorced so my outlook might 
be a shade jaded!&nbsp;</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 12:55:45 From: Donna Subject: 
Eczema &amp; wedding dress: need support!
<p>I wonder why they feel it is any of their business... And why you feel you 
owe them an explanation... I know women who, for religious regions, never wear 
sleeveless garments.</p>
<p>Anyways, a way around this is to have the sleeves made out of lace -- it 
will give you the coverage you seek, yet be cool in the summer.</p>
<p>So what if the sales assistant is looking? YOU are the one spending the 
money, if she indicates she has a problem with your skin condition, YOU 
indicate that you have enough of a problem with her attitude to consider taking 
your business elsewhere...&nbsp;</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 13:05:42 From: Wendy

<p>When I got married I got on prednisone for it. I figured that those will be 
pictures we will look at for the rest of our lives so I wanted to look normal. 
I know what you mean about trying on dresses. I was very self-conscious about 
it. Fortunately I found a dress that I loved on the first visit. Anyway, it is 
true what you said that you can never tell how bad it is going to be. That is 
why I took the prednisone. And of course, my skin hasn't looked that good 
since! Ah well. Good luck!</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 10:58:21 From: Kim Subject:

<p>Why not have a theme for your wedding then you can wear a dress that covers 
you and just say you like &quot;traditional&quot; or whatever. Then get 
yourself something slinky to wear at before or after wedding activities, so you 
can pick when you think your skin is at its best. I understand my mom always 
has another cause for my son's eczema and if he has skin out for people to see 
they think I let him get a sunburn, I want to say, mind your own business we 
are doing the best we can.</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 11:07:52 From: Toby Subject: 
colloidal Oatmeal
<p>I think but am not positive that &quot;colloidal&quot; means that the 
oatmeal is ground up and processed so tiny that it acts like it dissolves in 
your tub. Actually what I've used instead with similar results is: Take a piece 
of cheesecloth, put oatmeal (I used organic when I could) in it and tie it up 
tight. Now put it in your tub. It is just as soothing as Aveeno and a lot less 
expensive. You can just toss it out or compost it when your done. I used to 
take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time I felt 
comfortable in my skin. Great expression: Feeling comfortable in one's skin. I 
wish it to everyone on the list!</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 11:28:37 From: Ann

<p>Heather, First of all CONGRATULATIONS. I hope you 2 have a lifetime of 
happiness which clears your skin forever!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Wendy suggested, consider prednisone as this is a very special day. I've 
used it (or amped up my topical drugs) for less honorable occasions, if ya know 
what I mean! What ever dress or medication you choose, I think it is wise to 
have one stock phrase for those who comment on your skin. I forgot who 
suggested &quot;Why are you concerned about that?&quot; , but I think it's 
perfectly brilliant. You can choose a tone of voice to suit your mood and/or 
the status of the questioner. And whether you put the emphasis on the word YOU 
or THAT also varies the spin. Once you are prepared with a simple comeback, you 
will be more relaxed and able to enjoy dress hunting and also the big day. I 
bet you'll look so good at your wedding, no one will even think about your 
eczema!&nbsp;</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 14:23:09 From: Marilyn Subject: Eczema 
&amp; wedding dress: need support!
<p>Congratulations on your wedding plans! And I'm so sorry you feel that awful 
self-consciousness... the last time I went dancing, one of my partners backed 
away when he felt my hands (strategically bandaged!) and said &quot;I have to 
ask... is that contageous?&quot; Turned out he was a dentist -- (I laughed and 
explained, but notice I have not been dancing since.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently tried smiling and saying &quot;eczema&quot; when I get 
&quot;that look&quot; -- and to my surprise, I have met so many other people 
who have it, who have family members who have it -- I had no idea it was so 
widespread. So I would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker 
or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty 
shine through, and I expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer 
looks as well if you let them know what you're up against. (I notice, with new 
understanding, how beautiful my mother looked in 1945 in her long-sleeved 
&quot;old fashioned&quot; gown!) And while I'm at it, think I'll revive the 
fashion for wearing elegant gloves to a dance!</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 14:56:13 
From: Royce Subject: Eczema &amp; wedding dress: need support!
<p>Heather- Congratulations! I'm also getting married this summer and I 
absolutely LOVE this list and I am sooo happy that you wrote in about this. 
Sometimes this condition makes me feel so alone in the world and it is nice to 
know that there are others that can empathize. I think some of us with eczema 
live somewhat parallel lives. I have the same type of situation with my family.
</p>
<p>I actually picked out a dress for my wedding. It's a simple, off the 
shoulder short sleeve dress and I am praying that my skin is clear for the big 
day. Everytime I went to go shopping for a dress my skin would decide to flare 
up and become a lovely shade of sunburnt looking red (really bright against 
those white dresses).</p>
<p>My family is very supportive but sometimes they say hurtful things and 
don't even realize what they're saying My father suggested that I make a drappy 
scarf out of the material from the dress to put around my neck because I have 
these brown lines as a result of overuse of steroid creams. He didn't realize 
it but that made me even more self-conscious than I already am. Everyone used 
to try &amp; make me feel better by saying that I was the only one who noticed 
it and now I realize that it's not necessarily true. I am super sensitive about 
my eczema and when it's bad I feel disgusting. One thing I am definitely 
grateful for is my supportive fiance. He never thinks it looks bad (or so he 
says).</p>
<p>I'm going to the hair salon next week for some trial wedding hairdos and I 
am afraid that the woman is going to be kind of disgusted by my scaly scalp. My 
eczema is the worst there right now. Usually this is a place no one can see; it 
figures that it's bad now when someone will need to concentrate on this area.
</p>
<p>I don't mean to sound like &quot;woe is me&quot; I know things can be worse 
than this but it is a big time in a person's life and I hope that out of all 
the people out there the ones on this list will understand.</p>
<p>Good luck with your wedding plans and remember that there is at least one 
other person out there who can totally empathize. Thanks for making me feel 
like I'm not alone.</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 16:03:06 From: Karen Subject: Eczema

<p>My daughter (age 2-1/2) has eczema and complete strangers are always asking 
questions about it, so I can empthasize with your self-consciousness.</p>
<p>I encourage you to select the wedding gown that you'd feel most comfortable 
with and not worry about what friends and relatives think. After all, it is 
YOUR wedding!&nbsp;</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 16:10:22 From: Heather Subject: 
colloidal Oatmeal
<p>Thanks for the oatmeal tip. I was going to try grinding some oatmeal in the 
food processor, but maybe I won't go through the bother. Or maybe I will, and 
do a comparison test.</p> Date: 10 Feb 1997 19:53:23 From: Christopher Subject: 
Eczema &amp; wedding dress: need support!
<p>Donna is right; if people have problems with your eczema, let them deal 
with it. It is YOUR problem, not theirs, and is NONE of their business. I've 
been asked all of my life about mine, and it hurts sometimes (because it is so 
embarassing), but I've learned to deal with it (as you obviously have). Simply 
tell them what it is, and if they ask any further, take your business 
elsewhere. You don't have to put up with people's crap. Trust me, I know this 
from experience.</p>
<p>Another bit of advice. If, and when you begin to really not care about what 
people think of your eczema, that is when most will begin to ignore it. It is 
some psychological thing, I believe. I noticed that when I thought my eczema 
was some horrible, demonic thing, I rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it 
flared up more!). When I began to really not even care about it, I began dating 
this absolutely gorgeous girl (and its flare-ups decreased). The more YOU care 
about it, the MORE others will care about it. At least, that is what I have 
noticed, though I am probably wrong, but at least that is my observation.</p> 
Date: 10 Feb 1997 22:10:57 From: Marilyn&nbsp;
<p>I hate these looks too. I dumped a friend largely because she was so goopy 
feel-sorry-for-me it made me sick. And she always had new stupid theories to 
make me feel bad, make me feel like I had to follow her out-of-the-blue ideas. 
It's domineering to offer those theories. Tell them to stop it, that they don't 
have a clue. One guy was making up theories to me and I told him that I have 
this list for talking about my rash. I don't need his concern, thank you very 
much.</p>
<p>I was thinking of making a paste of zinc oxide and hypoallergenic brownish 
lipstick for covering the rash but my eczema has subsided so much that I don't 
even use much zinc oxide anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that my eczema is really everyone else's problem nearly 
as much as it is mine because they have to look at it -- and on your wedding 
day, it's their tough luck. The day belongs to *you* and your intended and 
nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Best wishes for a wonderful life together. </p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 04:42:17 
From: Brigit Subject: Heather- wedding dress
<p>This sounds like a clear case of lace to me. How about whichever dress you 
fancy with a lace wrap on top? If your eczema shows on the big day, you pin the 
wrap on with a brooch, if not, you just nonchalantly put it on and take it off 
as you wish.</p>
<p>BTW: I agree that if you tell people you have eczema, more often than not 
they say things like, Oh, I used to have it, but fortunately I outgrew it; or, 
Yes, Isn't that awful, my daughter has it, or things like that. Most people 
really are not malicious, they simply do not know. And more than you would 
think do know, and react quite sympathetically.</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 08:53:18

<p>A colloidal 'solution' is not a solution in the true sense, as the

particles are so tiny that it SEEMS to dissolve.</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 10:09:58 
From: Royce Subject: scalp
<p>Thanks to everyone who gave recommendations for the scalp problem I'm 
experiencing. It has been an ongoing problem for years. Sometimes it will clear 
up but it usually comes right back. I just went to the dermatologist last night 
and he gave me a sample of Temovate .05% (Clobetasol propionate .05% in a base 
of purified water, isopropyl alcohol &amp; carbomer 934P &amp; sodium 
hydroxide). I'll let you know how that works for me.</p>
<p>Another thing... My derm. also said that they just found out that Head 
&amp; Shoulders is just as effective as the Nizorol shampoo that he prescribed 
for me the last time I was there... interesting.</p>
<p>Also, I just figured out that I'm allergic to Polypropylene Glycol which is 
in the majority of medications my doctor prescribed to me for all these years. 
I discovered this while using DeSowen lotion- after using it on my face &amp; 
other areas of my body for over a year. My doctor raved about this stuff 
because it is weak enough to be used on the face. He seemed to be happy that I 
figured out (or at lease I think I figured out) one of the culprits but he also 
seemed a little embarrassed (or maybe even mad).</p>
<p>I'm pissed that my DOCTOR actually caused part of the problem. It makes me 
wonder why they don't test things on each patient (especially people with such 
sensitive skin) before just prescribing things at random. As we all know, and 
you would think all doctors would know, we all react differently to things. I 
guess I should be smart enough to test new products in one spot before putting 
it all over but I get anxious and I want to try to make my skin better right 
away. Sorry, just venting.</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 12:04:29 From: Debbie Subject: 
Julia's infant eczema
<p>The chiropractor seems like he's just rubbing and gently pushing specific 
spots while she's positioned a few different ways:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Me sitting, her leaning against me chest to chest</li> 
<li> She lies chest down across my lap</li> 
<li> She lies on her side.&nbsp;</li> </ol> Julia doesn't mind it (doesn't 
hurt) until she's on her side because she's freaked out by strangers, doctors, 
etc. He does a little bit more each time. And if one area has drastically 
improved he focuses on another area. All 3 areas of the spine actually have 
vertebrae affecting/affected by the stomach/liver area. Apparently, the causal 
relationship between the two (spine &amp; stomach) can go either way: stomach 
damage can short circuit the spine or a misalignment can mess up the stomach.
<p>I'm trying to work on it from both ends. Searching for things 
(easy-to-digest foods, supplements, minerals, vitamins, homeopathic remedies... 
MAYBE medication, though less likely) to help repair stomach, intestinal, liver 
areas. Plus treating the misalignment.</p>
<p>Her face started clearing for 3 days on her own (no cortisone), yet wasn't 
sleeping due to &quot;all-over-itchies.&quot; Looks like a sensation of bugs 
crawling all over you. So I resorted to Benadryl for a few nights as a crutch 
to help break the cycle. But if she's really itchy the antihistimine doesn't do 
a thing--she'll still wake up all night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, this weekend she was completely clear for the first time ever!!!!! 
In all, it was a total of 9 days in a row of gradual improvement and great 
sleep. Then the next 3 days were a gradual downhill. She had a disastrous 
itching fit in the car yesterday. Earlier in the day yesterday, she saw the 
chiropractor. He was concerned that she was pretty tight again, out of the 
blue. (Her face still looked real good at this point so he wasn't just reading 
her.) He hadn't really expected that. Although he did tell me to expect a few 
more cycles of good and bad times before healing. (Just like with 
homeopathy.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wasn't a big shock to me since she was showing other signs of stomach 
distress at home: squirming all over when nursing again, etc... Hmmmm. Two 
things I did differently at the end of the good cycle were: Let her eat a few 
things she hasn't had all month and visited a house with a dog again (last 2 
itching fits were while visiting a &quot;dog&quot; household and patting their 
dog.).</p>
<p>I've been noticing a 3 day cycle to the &quot;bad&quot; times. Today is day 
4 and she is better so far. She's still way better than before---hasn't gone 
that far backwards. And she's nursing normally today. So we'll see. I did have 
the chance to whisk her off to a Portrait studio on her best day--so I had some 
luck there. I was able to get a beautiful one year old portrait for her 
birthday! I hate to sound vain about surface looks, etc. but it is important. I 
want her to look back on her babyhood and not just see eczema in every picture!

on whom we must rely. I have been fortunate to have doctors who always 
prescribe ointments rather than creams. Ointments (in general) don't contain 
things like polypropylene glycol. All doctors SHOULD know this and should only 
prescribe creams (or lotions or gels) for allergic people when the greasiness 
of ointments can not be tolerated.&nbsp;</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 10:18:20 From:

13:32:33 From: Shelley Subject: Eczema &amp; wedding dress: need support!
<p>Heather, the lace suggestion sounds like a good idea to me. If lace isn't 
good for some reason, then experiment with other light materials to cover up 
yet be cool. I'm sure you can figure out something that will be at least 
tolerable.</p>
<p>But mainly I just wanted to offer some emotional support for what is 
certainly a difficult situation. I know what a big deal it is. The stress is 
high enough without eczema! You are right to remember that you don't know how 
your skin will be that day. Sure your skin could be broken out, but it could be 
really good because you'll be so happy, right? Try to set up the situation so 
that you have lots of little reminders that you're happy to be taking this 
step. No matter what condition your skin is in, the important thing to focus on 
is the wedding. Do whatever you can do to keep your focus off your skin so that 
whatever its condition, it won't take centerstage.</p>
<p>One of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and I 
remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be 
terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc. Everybody I know 
who's gotten married has worried about their wedding being ruined by something. 
Just do the best you can do and keep talking about your fears with your loved 
ones. When you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what 
we're here for. Don't suppress how you feel. Let it out, and let it go as much 
as possible. You'll get through this...</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 14:25:37 From: 
Royce Subject: polypropylene glycol
<p>I also thought that polypropylene glycol was not used in ointments but my 
dr. was going through all his little sample boxes and found that every one of 
them contained that ingredient.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under 
control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin 
that I don't think will ever go away (I use emollients &amp; zinc for this). 
I'm not sure what he'll find for me if I need a cortisone cream in the future 
(which unfortunately I'm sure I will) but I'm not too worried about it... yet. 
I would really appreciate it if you or anyone else who may know of of a 
cortisone that doesn't contain polypropylene glycol could let me know the 
name(s).</p>
<p>I've been using various cortisone creams, ointments... my whole life. I'm 
not positive but I think I just developed an allergy to this within the past 
couple of years.</p>
<p>Also, is anyone allergic to glycine/glycerine? I think I am but my doctor 
says that it's not possible (I think it's possible for me to be allergic to 
ANYTHING).</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 14:53:44 From: Brian Subject: The Riddle of 
The Itch
<p>I believe that the rule of thumb is to consider the combination of time and 
potency. A lower potency steroid could be taken for a longer period. In other 
words potency1 * time1 = potency2 * time2. If potency1 is lower than potency2 
then time1 is greater than time2. Whether or not it is safe is relative to your 
point of view regarding the long term effects of using steroids.</p>
<p>I was using a very potent steroid for about 4 months last year. Then I 
started receiving this mailing list. I use Lubriderm as a moisturizer (my 
doctor's suggestion) and Clotriminazole 1% (I got that tip here). This is just 
as effective as the steroid. My only concern now is that the anti-fungal 
properties of Clotriminazole will lessen due to extended usage and I may have 
to start using steroids again.</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 14:19:00 From: Alex 
Subject: glycine/glycerine
<p>If you are allergic to *glycine*, there's not anything you can do about it, 
since it is one of the amino acids that your body uses to make proteins. Even 
if you don't eat it, your body will make it from something else. So, I think 
your doctor is right about this one. If you were somehow allergic to glycine, 
eczema would be the least of your problems, since glycine is in virtually every 
protein in your body.</p>
<p>Glycerine is a different thing, though. </p> Date: 11 Feb 1997 12:40:05 
From: Michael Subject: base for steroid cream
<p>I used to use a hydrocorozone cream that was in a cold cream type base. I 
could never seem clear my eczema 100%. Eventually every time I put the cream on 
my eczema would burn. I figure that I am allergic to some sort of petroleum 
derivitive in the cream. So I went to my pharmacist and a doctor. The doctor 
just wanted to put me on stronger steroids. The pharmacist suggested switching 
to a hydrocorozone mix with a Cetaphil base. I went with the pharmacists 
suggestion and within a week I have almost entirely cleared up my eczema. 
Cetaphil is an apparently very hypoallergenic solution.</p> Date: 11 Feb 1997

(Longs proprietary formula) to be astoundingly effective on my eczema, i.e., 
it's vanished since I started using the stuff. I haven't used the other 
formulas. The following ingredients I copied directly from the labels.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Longs Clear Liquid SCALP RELIEF ANTI-ITCH MEDICINE. 1% hydrocortisone 
USP; Also contains: Menthol, Propylene Glycol, SD 40 Alcohol, and Water.</li> 
<li> Scalp-Itch &quot;by the makers of Lanacane&quot;, Combe Incorporated, 
White Plains, NY 10604. 1.0% hydrocortizone USP, SD alcohol 40.</li> 
<li> Cortizone 10 Scalp Itch Formula. Thompson Pharmaceuticals. 1.0% 
Hydrocortizone, Benzyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, SD Alcohol 
40-2 (60% v/v).</li> </ol> As I said before, I can't see why this formula 
should work when tubes of cortisone ointments and creams don't, but it does. My 
skin, however, is very sensitive to various oils (can't tolerate mineral oil 
formulations such as Eucerin or creams with more than just a little petrolatum) 
and the omission of oils from these lotions may help explain their 
effectiveness in my case.Date: 12 Feb 1997 13:25:43 From: Gayle Subject: 
Egyptian cotton sheets
<p>Egyptian cotton refers to the fiber it is made from. Egyptian cotton has 
longer and thinner fibers allowing a higher thread count (threads per inch). 
The tighter weave makes it feel wonderfully silky. Some have 320 threads per 
inch. I don't know but wonder if this tight weave makes things tougher for the 
dust mites.</p>
<p>I would not have believed this was true until I experienced it! </p>
<p>Previous to the Egyption cotton sheets, I had on some occasions changed 
sheets 3 times (all 100% cotton). Will the flannel be better for me to touch? I 
am sure many of you with eczema know the frustration of trying to sleep when 
everything you touch seems painful or makes you itch.</p>
<p>I brushed my hand on the sheets in a department store and couldn't believe 
the silky smooth feel. They were 100% Eqyptian cotton. I checked the price and 
asked the clerk when they would be on sale. They were already on sale. 
Fortunately, I was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a 
sheet).</p>
<p>Now any time I get into bed I enjoy the feel of those sheets. They seem to 
last longer than other sheets and still look great after a couple of years of 
frequent washing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found them at all department stores: Bloomingdales, Nordstroms, 
Macy's. I don't think so at Penny's or Sears. Most of the designer brands 
include Egyptian cotton. They come in dark colors and prints that hide stains 
from scratching and weeping.</p>
<p>We deserve the treat of something nice next to our skin. Treat yourself.

<p>I've been reading your posts for a couple of months and was surprised to 
see that there is a link between asthma, allergy, stomach problems and eczema. 
I have all of them although my eczema is limited to my hands. I can't imagine 
having it all over my body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to share with you information regarding a new moisturizing lotion I 
have been using. It is the best I've found and while it hasn't completely 
cleared my eczema, I think it is going to. The name on the bottle says 
therapeutic Atrac-tain with 5% urea. It is made by the Sween Corporation, N. 
Mankato, MN 56001. I don't think it is widely-used because there were only two 
bottles on the shelf and they look like they've been there for a while. I just 
decided to try it because it was one that I'd never tried and it didn't contain 
lanolin. The ingredients are: water, urea 5%, sorbitol, glyceryl stearate, 
lactic acid, isopropyl palmitate, octyl palmitate, stearyl alcohol, stearic 
acid, ceteareth-25, ceteareth-6, peg-40 jojoba oil, quaternium-15, 
menthylbenzethonium chloride and EDTA.</p>
<p>Just a note to Heather: My niece go married two years ago. She was a 
beautiful bride and she had a beautiful wedding. However, she still worries 
that her wedding was ruined because her mother-in-law used coloring in the 
wedding cake batter and the inside of the cake was pink and blue instead of 
mauve and green like she wanted. How's that for a &quot;major&quot; problem??

<p>Glycerin is an irritant to many people. It used to be a popular ingredient 
of many skin-care products, but its popularity has significantly gone downhill 
since it was found to irritate so many.</p>
<p>The reason it's still used is that it's absolutely necessary to produce a 
certain type of emulsion; it's not just something that's added, it's something 
you need when you want to produce a so-called &quot;vanishing cream&quot;. 
These days it's often replaced by one of its components, sorbitol (yes, the 
sweetener).</p>
<p>A Web search should yield more information than I can give you off the top 
of my head.</p> Date: 13 Feb 1997 15:30:57 From: Karen Subject: glycerin 
<p>I have always suspected that glycerin may give the illusion of lubricating 
the skin while it is in fact drying it out. My chemistry isn't great, but if 
glycerin is one of those substances that draws water to itself (hydrophilic?) 
from the air, then it must also drag water out of any other surface it's in 
contact with, in this case the skin. That's how honey and sugar pastes work 
when they're used as antibiotic dressings - they draw water out of the bacteria 
and kill them, I'm told. I should have paid more attention to the class on 
osmosis! Either way, it dried my (very oily) skin and that's the last thing 
eczema-people need.</p> Date: 13 Feb 1997 09:32:54 From: Lynn Subject: Hello 
<ol> 
<li> Someone posted names of some anti-dust spray products. I had been

Also, can they be sprayed on clothes as well? Mine pick up a lot of dust in the 
closet, but I would wonder about having the spray so close to my body.</li> 
<li> Has anyone had any experience with natural ways of increasing adrenal 
support (for those of us who have ruined our adrenal systems with too much 
prednisone)? One health practitioner recommended bovine glandular supplements, 
but I've heard these are controversial (and possibly connected to mad cow 
disease). II know there are other things one could do, involving minerals and 
vitamins. I am already on an extensive vitamin/mineral program, but wondered if 
anyone had strong feelings about or experience with the glandulars.</li> </ol>

<p>I've read it! He's the author that speaks about Leaky Gut... and says along 
with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas 
or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal 
misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and specific 
recommendations for diet and supplements and topical agents.</p>
<p>I like the book a lot. And like I've explained, I've been doing the 
chiropractor work, and dietary changes... but no enemas yet! Not on a baby (my 
opinion). I just give her a little bit of prunes every day. Now she's having 
one or two (better) bowel movements a day instead of one every two days. This 
is supposed to be better for them--to have food pass thru more quickly. The 
author does not speak at all about children or infants so I just use common 
sense, ask health food store prof. about supplemental/topical info, etc. If you 
don't already have a book like it then I think it's worth reading.&nbsp;</p>

Date: 13 Feb 1997 13:40:34 From: Shelley Subject: gamma interferon research 
study
<p>I finally got hold of one of the doctors involved in the gamma interferon 
study at UCSF. They haven't started yet because they haven't gotten approval 
from the UCSF review board, but they anticipate starting within the next few 
weeks. Here's some of the basic information you need to know:</p>
<p>They will teach you how to give yourself a daily injection of gamma 
interferon, which they said is a synthetic version of what is normally produced 
by the body. You have to give yourself the injection every day for 3 months. 
You have to come to the office to be checked 6 times (baseline test, then week 
1, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16 as follow-up). They will pay $140 for 
participation. He said they didn't think it would get rid of eczema permanently 
but would keep it under control (like insulin for diabetes). I spoke to Dr. 
Siebenlist at 415-476-4701 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Obviously you have to be in the Bay Area to even consider doing this, but 
he said there are other places doing the study. I will have to ask him where 
else so that others could check on the possibility of doing this closer to home.
</p>
<p>Criteria for inclusion in the study: Must have eczema for longer than one 
year, must have family history of related problems, must have 20% of the body 
involved or 10% of face, feet, or genitalia, must have normal kidney, liver, 
and blood levels (which they will test), if taking antibiotics must be only 
taking one type, if on allergy shots must have been taking them for at least 6 
months already, must have no heart disease, no diabetes, no vascular or 
rheumatology problems, no HIV, no cancer, no active infections, not pregnant 
nor lactating, no central nervous system problems, and never used interferon 
before.</p>
<p>So that's the basic information. Very interesting. I don't know if I will 
do it because I'm nervous about giving myself injections, but I'll think about 
it.&nbsp;</p> Date: 14 Feb 1997 10:04:36 From: Royce Subject: - egyptian cotton

<p>Debbie, I am sorry this GI was a disaster or so sounds like it. The formula 
he is recommending is the most expensive stuff on the market. The blood test in 
my opinion means nothing, even my GI never performed these tests on Mac. I do 
agree with the idea of changing your diet. It does directly affect the baby.</p>
<p>Sounds like they do not like the competition of a chiropractor. So who are 
they to make these types of judgements of other professionals?</p>
<p>I called my homeopathic MD for a referral for a chiropractor, unfortunately 
he is unavailable until Monday. Mac has not been well lately, he had a fever 
siezure on Sunday. This was new to me, I called the ambulance and had him 
rushed in. He is better now but still not right. He is crancy, flaring up, 
generally unhappy. He is not sleeping well even with the periactin. They 
plugged him full of medications, antibiotics, drugs, drugs, drugs. I did 
complain but they looked at me like I was crazy. That was when I threw the 
towel in and took him to my homeopathic MD. He said take him off everything. He 
will get better on his own. Best advice yet!</p>
<p>The homeopathic MD suggested vitamin therapy for Mac, first and foremost 
the colloidal minerals. These he has been receiving. He also suggested a 
vitamin high in leafy green vitamins. The first suggested vitamins he will not 
chew. I am now looking for a liquid form of the same type which can be mixed in 
his food. Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p> Date: 14 Feb 1997 11:18:19 From: Debbie 
Subject: Julia saw Pedi GI--finally!
<p>I'm sorry to hear about Mac's illness. Scary stuff. Did I tell you that I 
also broke down when Julia was sick with croup 2 weeks ago, and took her to a 
derm. for the first time? Thought I'd try it. But it was as expected: topical 
prescription cortisone, Bactroban (antiobiotic ointment), and a prescription 
antihitamine (Atarax). They seem to make no real difference in the sense that 
if she's itchy she still wakes up to scratch regardless of being drugged around 
the clock (which I did for a week). So, I stopped it, and will do it at just 
bedtime for a bit longer---just in case it's helping at all.</p>
<p>Julia's clearing again right now. So, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 
actual days of &quot;looking&quot; clear since she started out as mess), then 
went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going 
back uphill for the last 3 days. Since she was no where near 
raw/bleeding/oozing this time she's practically clear after only 2 days of no 
real itching.</p>
<p>You know, I am really wondering if it's not (also) due to the homeopathic 
remedy. This is the exact time period she described it would take. And it has 
been pretty gradual since Christmas... But I've been doing everything else 
since then too (diet, colloidal minerals, chiro.). But even the chiro. didn't 
seem to know why she was worse again on Mon. (while she was also starting to 
flare again too)... All I know is I am thrilled... something is working! Even 
the rest of her skin is becoming &quot;baby soft&quot; everywhere! Gotta go, 
off to the chiro.</p>
<p>If you don't already have a liquid form of colloidal trace minerals the one 
I get is by &quot;Innovative Natural Products&quot;, brown bottle, 1 oz., 4 
oz., and something like 7 oz., called Colloidal Multiple Minerals. I'm not 
doing a green leafy thing so I don't know anything about it.</p> Date: 14 Feb

(was:hello)
<p>Lynn, Craniosacral therapy () can help in restoring all the hormonal 
functions. I've just completed a course in it, and my skin is looking a hell of 
a lot better. If anything, the itch is worse, but I think that's a healing 
response (I really hope so) as the lesions are healing up, the dry patches and 
my total body eczema (mild) are practically gone. I'm back to eczema on my legs 
only.</p>
<p>The theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners 
just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process. It GENTLY 
repositions any dysfunctions in your body, and re-aligns the cranial bones to 
their correct position. This frees up trapped nerves, blood vessels etc, 
throughout the body and allows the organs to work properly. It's like 
osteopathy without the force. You feel light touch only. But it has powerful 
results, including a decrease in tension/stress.</p>
<p>As you can see, I'm sold on the idea! I'd recommend it to anyone. </p>

<p>We are still going to the chiro., although he just cut her down to once a 
week (after 3 wks. of going twice a week). There are a ton of chiros 
everywhere, as opposed to the amount of pedi GI's, for example. Although the 
quality of some might be better than others, I think they are probably all 
going to be of the same general philosophy. It's just what chiropractic med. is 
all about. And it is still considered alternative by alot of conventional 
med... Our insurance does not cover it. It was $45 for the first visit and $35 
for the rest.</p>
<p>By the way, I didn't consider the Pedi GI visit a disaster at all. I'm all 
for the specific tests he's running... and I didn't expect much more since we 
already got Julia under control once ourselves. I was hoping for tests, 
actually. And specific nutritional info. I don't know he could tell it's leaky 
gut or not without specimens. How did your Dr. diagnose it, by the way? If she 
takes to the formula (which I doubt) they'll give us a prescription for it 
which will just involve a $5 co-payment for us. We go back in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Julia just had her birthday party this weekend and was clear for it!!! That 
night though she started another mild bout--itchy, a little pinkish red----but 
nothing like she was. I'm seriously wondering about an allergy to dogs/cats. We 
don't have any. But everyone we know does. I used to visit my sister's house 
practically daily. Since everyone had one and I was always going somewhere I 
was never able to connect it. She just had chronic breakouts--every single day, 
worsenig as time went on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the only breakouts she's had this month have been after being around 
them: two bad ones after actually patting two different dogs on 2 different 
occassions, and then two mild ones after being in a dog family's house and then 
after dog owners came to our house and held her for a while, etc. (her party). 
I've been avoiding visiting anyone with a dog for 3 weeks now and these are the 
3 weeks she's been clear. Now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to at least 
suspect it. However, this is the same month that we've done a lot of other 
things differently too.</p>

<p>We think that Isaac's eczema is related to allergies, but we have not been 
able to pin down exactly what he's sensitive to. He's had RAST tests that 
identified peas, peanuts, and dairy as allergens, but we know that he has at 
least superficial (skin irritation) sensitivities to eggs, peaches, tomatoes, 
and especially mold.</p>
<p>We also think that his eczema got triggered by a series of antibiotics that 
he was on to fight ear infections that began at about 5 months. Our doctors 
just put him on one anti-biotic after another, and we went along with it, not 
knowing we should be concerned, for a few months. Then we began an ongoing 
&quot;fight&quot; with the medical community that we continue to fight. At 
first we didn't have much ammunition--we just tried to talk them out of 
prescribing antibiotics--but eventually we started seeing specialists, and got 
better information...&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, about a year ago, we did a while lot of things, which have definitely 
improved Isaac's skin from being very itchy, red, and cracking over a large 
percentage of his body, to today's cycle of flares and clear-ups on his legs 
and arms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> stopped all antibiotics. He still gets ear infections, but our ENT lets 
him fight the infections without drugs. We still might have to do ear tubes at 
some point, but his ears are NO WORSE than they were when he was on the 
antibiotics.</li> 
<li> wash all his bedding in superhot water once a week, including his stuffed 
animals, pillow, and bumpers.</li> 
<li> wash all his clothes in hot water (with All-clear, which seems to work 
for him), and double-rinse them.</li> 
<li> put him on a four-day rotation diet (only gets a particular food once 
every four days) from age 14 mos. to about 18 mos; now it's a two-day rotation).
</li> 
<li> eliminated all known allergens, and also several that the dermatologist 
suggested we stay away from &quot;just in case&quot;. We started eliminating 
lots: dairy, wheat, eggs, tomatoes, corn, chocolate, citrus, peanuts. Then we 
slowly added them back in, except for dairy, eggs, peanuts, and corn, which he 
has an obvious reaction to.</li> 
<li> saw a chiropractor. Not sure if this helped or not. We saw two different 
ones, and stopped after he became VERY scared of the second one (her 
adjustments hurt him). We might start this up again, and have a referral to 
someone with a good reputation.</li> 
<li> see a homeopath. We don't know whether this has helped or not. The guy 
has a great reputation, and Isaac's skin has definitely improved while in his 
care, but we've also done all these other things at the same time.</li> 
<li> started supplements. At the recommendation of a naturopath, he was taking 
all kinds of weird things, most of which we have now stopped. The one thing 
that we think really worked was the evening primrose oil. We started out with 
small doses (1/2 tsp. per day), with no results. Then a doctor who knows about 
alternative medicine (but has since closed up shop) told us to greatly increase 
the dosage, to 2 tablespoons per day. We usually gave him 4-5 tsp/ per day, and 
think that this really helped him. However, we recently heard from a 
nutritionist that large does of gammalinoleic acid can actually hinder brain 
functioning, which scared us so much that we stopped it altogether. And his 
skin went downhill, slowly, after about amonth. So we've just started up again, 
with 1 tsp/day, and looking for ANYONE who might know what a safe dose of this 
is. I have pored over medical journals, written to researchers, and still can't 
find anyone who will say what/if the negative side effects of evening primrose 
oil are.</li> 
<li> footed sleepers. Because his legs are his worse area, I have sewn socks 
into all of his jumpsuits and pants. This makes it much harder for him to get 
at his legs, and definitely helps him not scratch. It doesn't seem to drive him 
to his hands, either for some reason. It's a pain to change his diapers, 
though--have to take his shoes off each time.</li> 
<li> cool clothing. We dress him TWO full layers lighter than we are dressed. 
This was suggested by our doctor, and is hard for me to do because I grew up 
being constantly cold (for economic reasons) and have a big emotional reaction 
to cold. However, he is not at all bothered by it--he prefers it. So I have to 
get over my own stuff and dress him lightly.</li> 
<li> &quot;training.&quot; This sounds weird, but I began very early to help 
him figure out how to stop himself from scratching. When he was about 10 mos, 
he understood the concept of &quot;stop.&quot; So we began a game where we 
would (both) scratch our legs for a second, then throw our hands in the air and 
yell &quot;STOP!&quot; For a while, say at age 11 or 12 mos, this actually 
worked to help him stop. We'd play the game, and he'd stop. Now that doesn't 
work as well, but he's a pretty good talker now, so we have new options.</li> 
<li> &quot;counseling.&quot; Our theory is that his eczema/scratching is in 
part his way of dealing with emotional challenges, and that he scratches 
because it distracts him from the confusion/fear/pain he's feeling about 
something in his life. So when we have the attention for it, we have sessions 
where we lovingly, but physically, restrain him from scratching. He yells, 
cries, kicks, and struggles, but we calmly hold him, encourage him to keep 
going in his crying and kicking, and assure him that he's doing the right 
thing, we love him, and we'll help him through this. Getting his eye contact 
during this is tough, but important. These sessions seem to really help him. He 
finally slows down, seems to look at us more openly, asks to get down, and goes 
to play--without scratching. These can last from two minutes (any diaper change 
is an opportunity for a session) to an hour or more, depending mostly on our 
attention, not his.</li> 
<li> home daycare. We had to pull him out of a group daycare setting because 
his skin got so bad there. We have a person come to our home three days a week. 
This is expensive, but it's helped him, and we hope that eventually he'll be 
able to tolerate other environments more easily.</li> </ul> Date: 18 Feb 1997

knowing she was allergic to soy, we had been giving her soy toddler formula. 
Stopping the formula and following the allergist's protocol, her skin is the 
clearest it has ever been. There are still mild patchy outbreaks from time to 
time, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.</p> Date: 18 Feb 1997 17:32:03

<p>My daughter is also allergic to tomatoes she reacts with redness, itching 
and hives around her mouth. In spite of keeping her off of her allergic foods 
(tomatoes, chocolate,peaches) her eczema never cleared up. When allergy testing 
showed a MILD reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and 
her skin cleared up considerably. Tomatoes, potatoes and peppers are in the 
deadly nightshade family. Often there are cross-allergies between these 
foods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding Evening Primrose Oil: I took it for 3 yrs for Fibromyalgia and 
severe PMS. It worked beautifully but I had to discontinue it because it 
aggravated my irritable bowel syndrome. That is the only side effect that I 
have heard of, I believe it is generally quite safe.</p> Date: 18 Feb 1997

<p>According to my &quot;Bumper Book of Drugs for Hypochondriacs&quot; or 
whatever it is called, adverse effects from terfenadine are rare. Occasionally 
indigestion may occur. Headaches, drowsiness and dizziness are rarer, as are 
palpitations and fainting.</p>
<p>As for interactions with other drugs, antifungal drugs (including 
Ketoconazole and Itraconazole) and the antibiotic Erthromycin increase 
terfenadine levels and may affect the heart.</p>
<p>Terfenadine may increase the sedative effect of antidepressants, sleeping 
pills and antipsychotics, whilst antidepressants increase the chance of 
abnormal heart rhythms.</p>
<p>The anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which 
have anticholinergic effects. This includes antipsychotics and antidepressants.

Subject: Welcome Sue (&amp; Isaac)
<p>Hi Sue, I am doing the exact things you are! Julia's face has always been 
the worst. During 7 mos. to 11 mos. she was raw, red, oozing, bleeding on her 
face and it started spreading more to neck, wrists, legs, and elbows. Right now 
(and for last 3 weeks) she's doing great: clearing completely on some days. 
Even her bad days now are what good days used to be. Before this, she never had 
a clear day.</p>
<p>I'm a little confused what to blame the clearing on. She's been going to a 
hom eopath for 5 months. First remedy wasn't the one but she's doing much 
better since we started the second one (mid Dec.). But I also started a diet 
change then. I removed almost everything from her diet except rice, pears, 
apples, sweet potatoes, squash. We've also been doing the chiropractor for 3 
weeks now (twice a week) with great success. These are the same 3 weeks she's 
been clear. I've just started her on flax seed oil, which is kind of similar to 
evening primrose oil. I've also been giving her colloidal trace minerals.</p>
<p>As for the other routine stuff, I also use Tide Free, double rinse... hot 
water bedding... no antibiotics (she either had a bad reaction to Keflex at 7 
mos. or coincidentally got a virus then). I wasn't putting on any steroid 
ointment in those bad months because it wasn't changing anything so I didn't 
want the drugs. However, I use them occasionally now that she goes a week at a 
time with no new breakouts, etc. I've been giving her an antihistimine once at 
bedtime lately too. Although I'm not going to continue this much longer. I 
started it to help her sleep better while sick with Croup a few weeks ago. If 
she's itchy, she still wakes up anyway though.</p>
<p>Regarding the chiro: Did your chiropractor describe Isaac's condition to 
you in a visit-by-visit basis? Was Isaac real bad when he first came in, etc.? 
Because my chiro. had a lot to say about Julia. Said she was really, really 
tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible 
progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit. And 
sure enough we had just had a horrible night's sleep, which was the beginning 
of a bad 3-day cycle. The condition of her spine always coincides with the 
state of her eczema. I don't know if this is just coincidence or what... I'm 
most inclined to think that it's a case where everything is working together 
towards the same end cure. The remedy, the diet, the chiropr., etc. We are 
sleeping now though and she looks great so whatever the reason, I'm thrilled!
</p>
<p>Tell me about the homeopath you go to. Do you feel it's successful? Julia's 
on Bufo (toad poison), a minor one, not many people have heard of it. The first 
one she was on was Phosphorous. My homeopath feels absolutely certain that 
we'll get it right and that the eczema will be gone (along with future 
allergies, asthma... ). Did yours feel that confident about it. After just 
spending 3 months with an unsuccessful one, though, I wasn't feeling as 
confident as she was.</p>
<p>Have you been researching &quot;Leaky Gut?&quot; Your info. and solutions 
are just so similar to many of ours on this list. What have your doctors 
attributed all the allergies to? Any mention? Any theories of your own?</p>

Date: 18 Feb 1997 19:57:31 From: Tina Subject: Hello again
<p>I am finding all this very interesting because all these children sound 
just like my son Daniel. He is 16 months old and has been itchy since just a 
couple of weeks old. I nursed him for just over 5 months and our doctors all 
said he probably didn't have food allergies. Just bad cradle cap etc... My 
husband grew up with fairly bad eczema and is still itchy... The doctors 
finally said Daniel had eczema when he was a few months old and in the last few 
months we have been seeing an allergist.</p>
<p>Daniel is highly allergic to peanuts, filberts, cashews and eggs. A little 
allergic to citrus, beef, chicken, wheat and a few other things. Oddly enough 
he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one. When we first took 
him to the allergist his skin was so bad they couldn't test him there. They had 
to send blood to a special clinic. He then tested positive to potatoes and soy, 
but his last test came up negative.</p>
<p>Since removing some of these foods from his diet his skin has improved but 
not totally. His face and hands are still red and swollen and he gets blotches 
on the rest of his body that come and go daily.</p>
<p>The other day my husband was in restaurant with Daniel and a man gave him 
his card and recommended trying enzymes. He said his wife and children were 
itchy from head to toe and they are totally clear now. Has anyone heard of this 
or tried it?</p>
<p>We use antihistimines at night. Before we did that Daniel was awake every 
20 minutes to an hour scratching and crying. Now he wakes up about once a night 
for a water bottle. I saw on TV that some antihistimines can slow a child down 
over time, has anyone researched that yet?</p>
<p>We use topical steroid creams when he gets real bad only about once or 
twice every couple of weeks but they scare me.</p> Date: 18 Feb 1997 23:53:12 
From: Christopher Subject: Hello again
<p>His allergies sound exactly like mine, and I'm 15. I still have problems 
with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts. My skin is 
almost completely clear now, thanks to a good vitamin regimen, and a little 
change in diet. If I will do what I must to my diet, I believe I can rid myself 
of the problems that I even have now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, the summer was normally the worst for me, because I was outside 
the most. I would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot 
water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the 
summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching. I would also recommend 
that when you clean him, clean him thoroughly. Simply because, from my 
experience, only light cleansing is more irritative than none whatsoever. A 
thorough cleansing should help the itching quite a bit.</p>
<p>I've used topical steroid creams regularly since a baby, and I use them 
fairly regularly now (my eczema is not as bad). Though I am sure it is 
different for different people; I suppose I am very lucky.</p>
<p>I believe diet is a major factor, as well as regular bathing. I believe 
(though I may be wrong) that regular bathing would remove some of the bacteria 
that causes the itching. Also, a vitamin regimen would help sufficiently. I 
have noticed that a good vitamin regimen has almost eliminated the itching (it 
got to the point at one time that I wished I had a wire brush to scratch with), 
as well as induced healing. It has been extremely helpful on my scalp eczema. I 
might also suggest that &quot;sun bathing&quot; be used as well. I have found 
this to be very helpful in my case. The summers that I went swimming very 
regularly were the ones that I had the least problems, if I could tolerate the 
clorine. Though be careful and to not let the skin burn. That is no good. It 
can do nothing but make the skin worse.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you find a good allergist, and experiment with many of 
the therapies that have been mentioned in this group. The 
&quot;evaporation&quot; therapy that was mentioned by someone in the group has 
been something that I used in the past, though I never knew anyone else used 
it. It was a method that I stopped using (for some strange reason) a few years 
ago, and that is why I could not recall anything about it, until my mother told 
me that I did that at one time. It is quite helpful. There are so many things 
you can try. Though, if you are lucky, the condition should clear up as he gets 
older. Be careful that he does not scratch any particular places on his body 
regularly though. I have some really glaring scars on my body from when I was 
much younger from where I scratched a particular area constantly. If you can 
clear up the itching problem, 90% of the condition is solved.&nbsp;</p> Date:

<p>Hi Susan, I am also new to the list and felt very moved by your post. I

until about four years ago. Now, I am the worst I have ever and can barely 
stand to be in my own skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a three year old that we were afraid would get it but no problems so 
far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose 
and has never has another). I am not sure if you can do this with a toddler but 
Vitamin C gives me a lot of relief. I takes the burn out of my skin and also 
seems to promote the healing. I tried Primrose Oil along time ago and don't 
remember that it helped much but since your post, I think I will try it again.

<p>My son, Brian, is now 6-1/2 mos. old and has eczema on his face, scalp, and 
a few spots on his body. My dermatologist asked me to stop nursing last week 
asap ... so I haven't breastfed him since last Friday evening. And I started 
using Vitamin E cream on his face. Already his face is looking much better -- 
thank God! The derm told me to see how he is after one week off breastmilk, and 
if it's not better, he would need to have allergy tests done. So, you've 
already been down the path that we might need to walk. Could you tell me how 
they do the allergy testing on a baby -- just curious in case we need to do 
this.</p>
<p>I also have eczema. When I was pregnant, my hormones went crazy (of 
course!), and so did my eczema. I was on prednisone during late pregnancy when 
I just couldn't stand it anymore. Since Brian's birth, my eczema has calmed 
down a lot. When I read through past archives, I could relate to those of you 
talking about scratching for hours in bed at night. There have been many times 
in the past when I couldn't stop scratching. It's easy for my husband to say 
&quot;stop scratching&quot;, but he's not the one who is itchy!</p> Date: 19 
Feb 1997 11:46:28 From: Susan Subject: Welcome Sue (&amp; Isaac)
<p>No, Isaac didn't/doesn't get soy formula. Because his strongest allergy was 
to peas and peanuts, we just decided not to mess around with soy (and our 
allergist agreed). So he drinks rice milk (on his rice day, which is every 
other day now), fortified with calcium.</p>
<p>We are trying to distinguish between foods that Isaac's skin is sensitive 
to, and ones he's actually allergic to. Many, many foods make his face red and 
blotchy as he eats (he's not too neat). As I understand it, this isn't 
technically an &quot;allergy&quot;--that word is saved for reactions that 
involve his immune system. For example, tomatoes make his face red and itchy 
while he eats them, but don't seem to have a secondary reaction through his 
skin (ie, his eczema doesn't get worse after having eaten them). We used to get 
concerned these food &quot;sensitivities,&quot; but we've gotten so used to 
them that we don't get so concerned about them now. We still try to avoid those 
foods, though.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, we have noticed a change in Isaac's skin--I've 
even wondered if he even has eczema anymore. His skin used to be red, patchy, 
raised, and when he'd scratch, it would get very angry red, raised, dry 
looking, and eventually bleed. In the last few weeks, his skin has been 
blotchy, but the blotches are not usually raised--they're splashes of color. 
Instead of that red, raised skin, he gets welts. Welts everywhere, all the 
time. He almost always has a few on his face these days--isolated little raised 
circles, whitish, that look like what a mosquito bite looks like in the first 
minute or two after you get it. These do not then get red and angry--they just 
disappear. And new ones show up somewhere else. When he scratches now, instead 
of that red and abraded skin, he gets BIG patches of welts--dozens of small, 
white bumps, amost contiguous to each other. They are raised by just one or two 
swipes of his scratching, and they last for about ten minutes, then go away.</p>
<p>Has anyone else ever seen this change? It looks so much more 
&quot;allergic&quot; than it used to. And he's so SENSITIVE now... just getting 
excited during play will bring welts out on his face and legs. He's always been 
sensitive, emotionally, but this physical sensitivity is striking.</p> Date: 19

Please mention it soon to a doctor. Most of my hive attacks have been of no

help. Generally, I prefer to deal with hives rather than eczema (because hives 
go away on their own), but the hives are more medically significant.&nbsp;</p>

itchiness or blotchiness or food allergies... not being able to eat what other 
people eat? My husband has a better understsanding on the inability to stop 
scratching than I do since he grew up with eczema, but not on his face, it was 
mostly wrists and arms.</p>

Date: 19 Feb 1997 18:06:24 From: Rita Subject: Child ECZEMA
<p>Reading the recent postings on the possible causes of eczema, I have been 
thinking about the cause of my 11 months' . So far, we haven't been able to 
pinpoint what causes it. There are just all these theories.</p>
<p>I used to think her problem is leaky gut but am not so sure anymore. The 
only thing Jodi has benefited from is Chinese Herbal Treatment. Her diagnosis 
is toxins in the blood. When I asked the Chinese dr where the toxins came from, 
he said it was from me when I was pregnant with her. True there was a history 
of atopy. My father had asthma as a child. Several of my siblings suffer from 
rhinitis. Another is highly allergy to certain food. I had eczema as a child 
but quickly and luckily outgrew it very early on. Could Jodi's eczema be due to 
bad genes?</p>
<p>Jodi was born a full term baby at 8 lbs 2oz. Delivery was very very smooth, 
less than 10 minutes. Could the pressure from the birth canal have caused 
damage to her craniosacral system? I doubt it. I had acceptable weight gain of 
33 lbs during that pregnancy. Felt great all through pregnancy, needed no 
medication or had no complications at all. Jodi has had no blows to her head or 
trauma to her spine; couldn't think of anything that could cause any neurotoxin 
or any malnutrition. She was breast fed till 7 months. Never had any thrush or 
any sign of candida, no ear infection or use of antibiotic . Never used 
antihistamine either, only used steroid for a short period. Her formula is 
Alimentum which has no milk protein or milk sugar or soy. Her solid food only 
include pear, apple, rice, carrot, yam, very lean pork, Chinese leafy green and 
rice cereal. She has bowel movements 2-4 times a day, with her poo looking 
either soft-sausage-like or custard-like. She has no diaper rash from her poo 
which may suggest undigested food and she has very good appetite. I also cook 
her food from scratch. Still, something is missing and I don't know what.</p>
<p>Well, the benefit from the Chinese herbal treatment seems to give way to a 
series of countered epidsodes . Jodi has not had much luck since her return 
from her Chinese Herbal treatment in China. The Aveeno oatmeal bath caused full 
body contact dermatitis. Then a viral attack caused huge blisters over her lips 
and eczematic right cheek. 2 more major flare ups within the past 10 days, both 
happened when we were dining out in a restaurant which was overheated and 
crowded. We ended up leaving in the middle of the course but it was too late. 
Damage had been done. I wanted to kill myself for letting all that happen to 
her.</p>
<p>I try to put these pieces together and still couldn't make sense of what 
I've noted. All I know is Jodi likes cool and well ventilated places like our 
home. When her body temperature rises, her skin acts up and rashes develop 
quickly, especially on her cheeks. I still cannot tell if the pruritus comes 
first or the rash comes first. They almost always happen together. She also 
tends to scratch more when she is not content i.e. like when she is sleepy but 
doesn't want to sleep; or if she can't get to where she wants to go. She's 
learning to walk holding onto things around her. But since she hates lying on 
her belly or being in the crawling position, there are times she can't find 
anything to support herself to move around. I notice that is when she'll start 
scratching, more like out of desperation and not because she needs to. Not like 
her sister, who cried out for help when she was in the same situation at the 
same age. Jodi doesn't call for our help, she simply starts scratching. I 
sometimes think that's her way of drawing our attention. Either my husband or I 
have to stay with her or else she'll start scratching. And now her sister wants 
the same attention. Being part of the care-taking doesn't seem to appeal to her 
anymore. I wish they could grow faster. I know things will get easier when 
Juliet has passed her terrible TWO and Jodi's immune system gets stronger.</p>
<p>I'd better get my mind off her eczema. I can go on and on and on... 
thinking... there must be something I can do to help.&nbsp;</p> Date: 19 Feb

<p>Rita, Your post was heartbreaking... I was born with eczema, came home from 
the hospital with it. I suffered with it until I was about 15 years old. It 
gradually got better, then... I thought I was cured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 32 years old, my husband and I moved to a new house to start our new 
family. I now have eczema the worst I have ever been in my life. I am miserable 
in my own skin with it head to toe. When I am nervous or hot, it is much worse 
and if I sweat, I feel like I will die. My mother and I have gone back over my 
highs and lows with it and the relationship to the homes that we lived in. It 
all fits!!! I have been tested my times, the most thorough being a blood test. 
I had very few reactions to foods, just swordfish. Many plants, trees, dust and 
molds had catastrophic reactions.</p>
<p>The different houses that I have lived in have been the pattern. Even when 
I was a child, my parents built a new home and I completely cleared up. There 
is a company called &quot;National Allergy Supply, Inc.&quot; 1-800-522-1448 
that markets a test that you can order for $25. In a nutshell, you collect dust 
from your home and send it to John Hopkins, they will analyze it and tell you 
what is in your home. I haven't tried this yet but am planning on it. I am 
researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house I live 
in now. I am not sure that will show up on the test.</p>
<p>My mother always told me how heartbreaking it was for HER that I had eczema 
and not to itch it!... just tell your baby that you will find a way for her to 
be normal... I always just wanted to be normal.</p>

soon as possible with cold water followed by air drying, I've pretty much got 
it to a tolerable stage. I now double rinse clothing that touches the affected 
areas and omit fabric softener on them. I've added zinc to my vitamin regimin.

16:49:24 From: Christopher Subject: My anti-eczema vitamin regimen (THIS WILL 
NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE!)
<p>I have been hesitant for some reason to post vitamin regimen. I suppose it 
is because so many people are probably allergic to many of these things... but 
here we go (These are all taken twice a day):</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 1 Vita Smart Men's Multi-Vitamin&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 capsule (400 I.U.) Vitamin E&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 capsule (19 grains) of lecithin (I believe this is a soy derivitive --I 
am just experimenting with this one!)</li> 
<li> 1 Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc tablet (333 mg/133 mg/5 mg)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> 1 Potassium tablet (99 mg)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> Cod Liver Oil (A &amp; D Supplement) (1250 I.U./130 I.U.)</li> 
<li> 1 Nature's Biotics caplet (500 mg)&nbsp;</li> </ul> Can be obtained from: 
Life Science Products, Inc. St. George, Utah 84770.
<p>Along with this, I treat the condition further with Schering's Elocon 
Ointment (0.1%) (a steroid cream; not regularly), and Vaseline Intensive Care 
Lotion: Sensitive Dry Skin w/ oatmeal.</p>
<p>This is my treatment for my eczema, and it helps a lot. I have noticed that 
since I have quit taking the Nature's Biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten 
worse, so I KNOW that that one is helpful. I also may note that the Lecithin 
may be causing more harm than good (I am experimenting with it). It may also be 
worth noting that the Cod Liver Oil (A &amp; D), as well as the Vitamin E are 
essential.</p>
<p>Again, this is only my way of treating the problem, and it differs from 
person to person; depending on allergies, etc. Much of this regimen is not 
simply to help the eczema, but to help my health in general (I don't eat what I 
should).</p> Date: 20 Feb 1997 11:32:45 From: Susan Subject: Child ECZEMA 
<p>I took Isaac to the pediatrician yesterday because he'd developed new spots 
on his chest--a new kind of spot he hasn't had before--not even hive-ish. Turns 
out he probably has a viral infection (white blood cell count is up), which 
could be accounting for why he has so many hives lately. The great news was 
that he weighed 20 lbs, 15 oz--a gain of a whole pound. We have been struggling 
with his weight for so long--he limps along on his little 1st percentile growth 
curve. Then last month he fell off even that curve, and our doctors were 
concerned that we have more than eczema to worry about. Which still might be 
true, actually, but it was such a great thing to have him break the 20-pound 
barrier. (Jeez, he's almost two, and technically, he should still be in the 
infant car seat!)</p>
<p>Linda--I had a question about the breast-feeding advice from your 
dermatologist. I spent the first year of my life as a very sick kid, and it 
took the doctors a year to figure out that I was very allergic to dairy--so 
allergic, that I was reacting to the dairy coming trhough my mom's breastmilk. 
I think that the same thing happened to Isaac--I was drinking lots of milk, and 
eating lots of peanut butter, when I was breastfeeding him, and I was making 
him sick. So I stopped breastfeeding about about five months, but the allergies 
were all rolling by then. And, unfortunately, once I wasn't breastfeeding him 
anymore, he got in this never-ending cycle of ear infections. Now I'm not sure 
that he wouldn't have had the ear infections anyway, just because of the 
allergies, but in retrospect, I think I should have forced myself to stop the 
diary and peanuts in my diet, and kept breastfeeding him. Even knowing what I 
know now, though, I might not have done it, then--breastfeeding was terribly 
painful for me, I was really ready to quit... So I was wondering how you're 
feeling about stopping so abruptly. I know doctors can sometimes be pretty 
blithe about their recommendations, not thinking through the whole picture and 
just concentrating on fixing the portion of the problem you've presented them 
with...&nbsp;</p>
<p>About enzymes. Our first naturopath recommended that we give Isaac 
pancreatic enzymes. We used a product called &quot;pancreatin,&quot; and I 
think it was by NOW vitamins. It's basically ground up pig pancreases, or 
something gross like that. We went through a bottle of the stuff, but never 
noticed any change, and quit. It comes as powder in a capsule, so it was easy 
to give him--just sprinkled it on his applesauce.</p>
<p>My heart also went out to Rita. That feeling of just not knowing how to put 
all the clues together to FIGURE IT OUT is so FRUSTRATING. Two or three days a 
month I spend raging around my house, my mind going 100 miles an hour, going 
over and over and over my notes, articles, the labels of foods and vitamins, 
just trying to find the thing I missed that will make the whole picture make 
sense. AGH!!!</p>
<p>The picture of Jodi on the floor, scratching rather than yelling for help, 
is a replica of what Isaac used to do. He does it less now. I don't know if 
what we did helped, but here's what it was. First, we would go over to him and 
get right in his face (which sometimes meant lying on the floor so we could 
look UP at him), and saying something like, &quot;Looks like you're having a 
problem here, huh?&quot; in a concerned, but light voice. Then we'd say, 
&quot;I'm going to try to help you!&quot; Often Isaac would look away, or get 
this vacant look in his eyes, and keep scratching. So we'd start over. 
Sometimes we'd have to pick him up, or put him in our laps, to get even enough 
of his attention to talk to him. The problem with holding him is that he's not 
forced to acknowledge us. Eventually, we'd get his attention, and then we could 
talk about the challenge at hand (&quot;It looks like your blue truck is stuck 
under the couch... &quot;. OR we'd have to hold his hands, and get into one of 
those &quot;counseling sessions&quot; that I described in my other posting. 
This seemed to help him, but it takes a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Out of that, Isaac developed a new &quot;defense mechanism.&quot; He 
started sucking his thumb and twirling his hair--a trick he still uses when he 
is frustrated or overwhelmed. We prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally 
try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't &quot;going 
away&quot; to deal with his problem by himself. My trick is another game--I 
stick my thumb in my mouth, suck on it a second, then pull it out and scream, 
then laugh. Isaac thinks this is very funny, and he tries it, too.</p>
<p>I am slowly getting used to the idea that there might not be a final 
solution to I's eczema--we might always ride this roller coaster. Not easy for 
a control freak like me.</p> Date: 20 Feb 1997 10:32:06 From: Kim Subject: a

talks about Pizza or HotDogs but never offers to have a fit over not having 
them. I do send him a special treat when other kids are getting something 
special for a party or whatever. Anyway don't worry about the having to be

1997 13:26:22 From: Shelley Subject: Patsy &amp; Issac
<p>As Sue described her son Isaac, who scratches when he is frustrated, I 
realized that I too learned this habit in infancy and never got over it. After 
40 years, the habit is so ingrained it is automatic. Nothing else is as 
satisfying as scratching. It's like the Newton law of physics that says 
&quot;every action has an equal and opposite reaction.&quot; Every frustration 
I experience seems to require the equal and opposite reaction of scratching. 
The force of the scratching seems to be the only thing that equals the force of 
the frustration. I've tried pounding pillows, but that doesn't match the 
refined motor skill sensation of fingers scratching.</p>
<p>The only thing that I've known to give me equal satisfaction is when I can 
ask a friend to gently rub my back, and of course this has to be a very close 
friend, and I have to be willing to let myself sink into the feeling in my body 
at the time. When I can allow myself to really experience the feelings, I can 
tell that the comforting sensation of a hand rubbing my back is something I 
never got enough of as an infant/child. That simple gesture means so much to 
me. My skin was always so bad that I understand why my parents were reluctant 
to touch me, but I recommend that parents find a way to touch in a repetitive 
soothing manner, otherwise the child will continue to scratch in desperate 
efforts to provide the physical sensations they crave.</p>
<p>And scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling 
comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching. It's like 
junk food, empty calories, you keep eating and eating and you're never full. 
But if junk food is all you have access to, you keep stuffing your face with it.
</p>
<p>It's heartbreaking to read all these posts from mothers. They remind me of 
my childhood of agony and help me have sympathy for my mother who had no one to 
talk to about her experiences. Those of us who've had eczema all our lives 
remember the hope that we would grow out of it, and I hate to be a spoil sport 
and say &quot;don't get your hopes too high&quot; because I remember how that 
hope kept me alive for 14 years. As an adult, I have to find new reasons to 
live each day.</p>
<p>Today I'm grateful that my skin is under control. My friend rubbed my back 
yesterday and that was wonderful. The sun is shining and I'm going out to take 
a walk.&nbsp;</p> Date: 20 Feb 1997 14:12:02 From: David Subject: Triludan

<p>Thanks to all who responded re: mothers of children with E. My heart also 
goes out to all the moms -- I know what it's like, and it's heartbreaking. It 
helps to know there are other moms out there going through the same struggle. 
As I said previously, I suffer from eczema, but I no longer even worry about 
myself (although I should). Brian started with E at 5 or 6 weeks old... and I 
cried and cried several times in the beginning blaming myself for 
&quot;giving&quot; this disease to him. It took a while, but I've gotten over 
the guilt, and realized that it wasn't something I wanted to give him, it's 
just part of life and heredity. We are trying to help him as best we can right 
now, but I also believe in prayer. My husband and I pray daily for Brian (and 
myself) for healing of the eczema. God has been my source of strength through 
this time.</p>
<p>Shelley: Thanks for your point of view re: touching, physical contact. I do 
rub Brian's back sometimes, but he scratches his head the most, so I try to rub 
his head (and massage with baby oil) for him whenever I catch him scratching.
</p>
<p>Sue: Thanks for sharing so much about Isaac. I'm glad you found out what 
the hives were from. Brian's derm was quite blunt -- she wanted me to stop 
nursing that very day! I just laughed and told her I'd stop as quickly as 
possible (within a week). It was difficult to stop so suddenly, although I was 
down to feeding him only 2 or 3 times a day since I work full-time. I do miss 
that one-on-one contact with him, but he seems to be OK with it. He never gave 
me any problems going back and forth from breast and bottle. I guess it's a 
good thing he was used to having a bottle. He has had three ear infections so 
far and (after reading some of the stories on this list) now I wonder if 
there's any connection between the antibiotic and the eczema.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmmm. .. it will be interesting to find out what exactly he's allergic to. 
I also eat lots of dairy and peanut butter. I was trying to eat nutritious 
snacks to keep my weight up -- I kept losing weight while nursing. Of course I 
also had my share of goodies -- chocolate. It upsets me to think that by 
nursing, I was causing his eczema, but it's probably true. Sometimes I guess 
breastfeeding isn't always the best for baby! We started feeding him corn this 
week, and his back and stomach are broke out again with E. Wonder if he's 
allergic to it? I'll keep you posted.&nbsp;</p> Date: 20 Feb 1997 12:42:35

<p>I have been reading alot about nursing and eczema and allergies on this 
list. Our Dr. never said nursing caused E (I nursed just 5 and 1/2 mos) but 
Daniel was always broke out. I also ate alot of peanut butter, nuts and dairy 
because I don't like much meat. Now Daniel is allergic to peanuts, but not 
dairy. The Dr. still says that even though the allergies make the E worse, he 
will still always have some problem with it since my husband has E and is 
allergic to dogs and cats. The allergist says Daniel will most likely outgrow 
the food allergies all but eggs and peanuts, but by the time he is 4 or 5 will 
become allergic to airborne allergins. Has anyone else been told that?</p>
<p>Our Dr. also says that E, allergies and asthma all go together. Besides my 
husbands E and allegies, we have a nephew with bad asthma, and my husband's 
great grandfather had asthma also. So I do believe it.</p>
<p>It is good to know there are other parents out there that have a hard time 
getting there little ones attention to stop itching. Daniel just sits on the 
floor, pulls his pant legs up as far as he can, pulls his socks off and 
scratches til he is almost bleeding. If I am not in the room my 3 and 1/2 year 
old can be heard yelling----stop scratching!!!!!!----so that's my cue-----</p>
<p>What do I look for in a tar shampoo? What are some well known names? 
Daniel's head is real flaky and itchy and scabby from scratching. I've been

with allergies being interviewed. My 3 and 1/2 year old understood what it was 
about. He goes around telling everyone about how his brother can't have peanuts.

<p>Last October, I had a major flare that knocked me down for a couple weeks. 
I had to go to prednisone for the first time in my E. career. After 10 days, I 
tried to wean off and had a return flare as bad as the first. The prednisone 
did a great job but I couldn't seem to get off of it. Around that time, I ran 
into a product that involved a conbination of multivitamin, cheleated minerals, 
a variety of antioxidants and proanthocyanidins (in the class of bioflavanols. 
I began these products for a week and then again attempted to wean from 
prednisone. To my surprise, I did not have any problems. In fact I have not had 
any E. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm 
that does not grow or itch!</p>
<p>This has been a tremendous three months for me. I have caught up on 
literally years of sleep. I have renewed energy, do not scratch at night and am 
not experiencing any itching that I cannot easily resist. It would almost 
appear to me that I mark significant improvements on a weekly basis... 
especially this last 3 weeks. I have gotten many compliments from friends and 
family on the condition of my facial skin, my eyes (which were typically so 
bloodshot that it looked as if I had been on an extended bender) and the fact 
that I look rested. My wife and children have noted a definite positive change 
in my demeanour. I am not on the edge of constant irritation and feel that I 
have had my sense of humour return! I think the midnight scratch-fests and 
constant irritation sapped my energy reserves over the years. Maybe I am 
getting some of that well needed energy back now.</p> Date: 20 Feb 1997

miracle cure?&nbsp;</p> Date: 21 Feb 1997 10:05:54 From: Sue Subject: Childhood 
Eczema
<p>Shelley--It is so interesting that the repetitive motion of a backrub can 
help actually quell the itching for you. It gives me hope that we CAN do 
something to break this cycle of scratching that our kids are just building 
now. Kids are smart--they'll find all kinds of ways to substitute for what they 
know they need, but aren't getting. I wonder if you could find people to rub 
your back for a few hours every day, if you could help your skin. The world 
owes you a lot of catch-up back-rubbing!</p>
<p>I think it was Linda who talked about the guilt feelings of passing her 
eczema on to her kid. I still struggle with that one, because right after Isaac 
was born, we took him to a naturopath who told me I should immediately take all 
dairy, corn, wheat, and peanuts from my diet, as long asI was nursing him. The 
guy had a terrible &quot;bedside manner,&quot; and I was so pissed off at his 
seeming disregard for what *I* needed that I didn't follow his advice. I was 
starving! I'd had gestational diabetes for the last 2 months of pregnancy, 
which I controlled with diet, not drugs, so I just couldn't get enough to eat. 
Then I could not eat enough to maintain my weight while breastfeeding, and then 
he tells me to cut out foods that represent about 90% of my calories.</p>
<p>I know I did the best I could. But if I could have gotten over the hurt 
from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet 
(instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), 
it probably would have helped Isaac. I bring this up because it highlights how 
complicated this whole thing is, and how important it is to have some 
care-givers who are sensitive to the whole picture...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never had eczema, but some of my insights that I use to help Isaac 
come from growing up with a younger sister who was very debilitated by it. 
Sometimes we even had to carry her because her skin was so bad that if she 
walked, scabs would break open and she'd bleed. Feelings of anger, guilt, and 
frustration at my parents still cloud my thinking now, esp. when I remember the 
times that I didn't help my sister because her whining and scratching were 
driving ME crazy. After years in a Zen training center and a major diet change, 
my sister now has good control over her skin, and she is very articulate about 
the emotional hurts that her scratching helped keep at bay.</p>
<p>She's also a great source of advice on Isaac. She's the one who told me to 
start the &quot;Just say &quot;no&quot; to scratching&quot; technique. I'd 
thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he 
sure reacted that way!). But she said she thought that babies confronted with 
such terrible itchiness NEEDED their parents to step in and stop them--they 
just weren't strong enough to help themselves. The trick, however (which my 
parents did NOT do with her) was to stay loving and close and be willing to put 
up with the tirades that would come with forcing him to stop... when I think of 
all the nights that that little girl lay in her bed, with socks pinned over her 
hands, moaning and crying, I cry. Every time.</p>
<p>Jeez, this is such an emotional topic! What can we do to help the 
traditional (and even alternative) medical profession deal with that fact?</p>

<p>We just started using a tar shampoo for EJ. It is &quot;Nutrogena T&quot;

remember the last time he had some in the store.</p>
<p>Then I saw the ad and walked out and bought it. </p>

will be too harsh.</p>

11:29:18 From: Sue Subject: eczema-&gt;athsma connection
<p>About the connection between eczema and later respiratory difficulties... 
The medical community uses the concept of &quot;atopia&quot; to describe people 
who have a predisposition to allergic reactions... they predict it based on 
family histories of allergies. For example, when Isaac's skin was terrible, by 
age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was &quot;atopic,&quot; (we 
both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very 
likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their 
whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older. Signs they looked for 
were: eczema (alraedy obvious); ear cracks (where his ear lobe meets his 
head--a pretty constant crack there); creased eyelids (instead of just one fold 
in his eyelid, there were always a couple, both top and bottom); etc.</p>
<p>Our natural practitioners have given us a very different view on this 
&quot;atopia&quot; idea. In their opinion, kids retain these symptoms for their 
whole lives because doctors don't CHANGE anything that CAUSES the 
problems--they just deal with the manifestations--quiet the skin with steroids, 
open the bronchial tubes with inhalants, etc. So the body just keeps 
manifesting the underlying problems--first through eczema, then through athsma, 
etc.</p>
<p>I don't think that anyone believes that eczema or asthma is caused by just 
one thing, so it's really hard to ever wipe out the root cause. But I think we 
can to lots of things to attack the problem ENOUGH so that the body can take 
over and heal itself. I think the leaky guy syndrome is one example of a 
cause--if substances are leaking into the wrong body cavities and causing 
problems, then the body will manifest this problem with eczema, maybe. Fix the 
leaks, or remove the offending substances that leak, and the skin can get 
better. And maybe (and I guess this is faith) the body can eventually heal 
itself if it can get out of the cycle long enough to &quot;catch up&quot;.</p>
<p>So I am refusing to believe the inevitability of the eczema-athsma 
progression. And examples from this list give me hope. People are finding the 
right combinations of vitamins, diets, allergen avoidance, emotional 
assistance, etc., and are actually getting better. At age 10 months, our 
doctors were convinced that Isaac was &quot;atopic&quot; (and he was, in their 
definition). They are amazed at what he looks like now--no extra eyelid folds, 
no ear cracks, a clear face, etc. His legs are still a mess, but they're 
getting better. And they are actually suggesting now that maybe he WILL be part 
of the 60% of baby eczema sufferers who WILL outgrow it. Now, of course, they 
attribute his improvement to pure aging--he &quot;grew out of it.&quot; Very 
convenient.</p>
<p>And even if he doesn't--we will keep looking for underlying causes. And 
avoiding the antibiotics and steroids. I would put money on a bet that in the 
next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to 
the progression from eczema to athsma... just a guess.</p> Date: 21 Feb 1997

<p>I was just rereading a supportive message from Royce (thank you again!) re: 
wedding dresses and E., in which she mentions turning a lovely shade of bright 
eczematic red when she went dress shopping. I just wanted to second her itch, 
if I may. ;-) I've noticed that when I'm clothes shopping or fabric shopping, 
my hands frequently start acting up (getting hot &amp; itchy; patches of E. 
start to redden). My dermatologist doesn't think that my E. is allergy-related, 
but I do know that textile manufacturers treat fabrics with a number of 
chemicals, including formaldehyde, which probably don't do much for us E. 
sufferers!</p>
<p>Also, with wedding dress-shopping in particular, there may be emotional 
baggage aggravating the E. (been there!).</p>
<p>By the way, I went dress pattern shopping with my grandmother &amp; mother 
and chose a pattern with a cap sleeve and high-cut back which looks stylish, 
but which doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. When my mum suggested something 
with a low back or no sleeves, I just said, &quot;Well, I don't know how my 
skin will feel that day, and I'd be happier in a different dress.&quot; She 
agreed, and the whole process was much more low- key than I expected (no 
attempts on her part to find the &quot;cause&quot; of my E., etc.). Thank you

Your daughter is on the same diet as my son but we have not embarked on the 
Chinese herbs. I do worry about enough vitamins, my homeopathic MD recommended 
essential minerals, it did make a difference. He also recommended other 
vitamins but I am still in search of something he can chew or tollerate. In 
your list of foods you mentioned carrots, not in our camp. We have had success 
with lamb, turkey, butternut squash, baby food squash, prunes, peas and 
spinach. What chinese vegetables is she taking?</p>
<p>By the way, I am the leaky gut person, my gastroenterologist diagnosed his

histamine (periactin). I use the periactin when he has a bad flare up, it does 
help. Next I am trying Debbie's suggestion of a chiropractor.</p>

<p>It is true everyone's E is different but I suppose all E sufferers share 
something in common.</p>
<p>Sue - Though the viral attack started a month ago, Jodi still has a few 
scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there. When I see 
them, I put tea tree oil ointment over them to avoid secondary infection. They 
usually dry up and go away in 2-3 days. I only hope that Isaac's viral 
infection is not going to get as ugly as Jodi's. When blisters show up on 
eczematic skin, topical antibiotic helps to stop infection from getting out of 
hand. Try not to use systemic antibiotic. It won't stop the viral attack and it 
destroys good flora. I also give ecchinacea-for-children and an herbal extract 
drink to my kids to boost their immune system.</p>
<p>Breast-feeding Linda &amp; Tina - It's not difficult to continue breast 
feeding your baby even if your dr asked you to stop for a while. I rented an 
industrial breast pump when my milk first came in and when we needed to go out 
and Jodi's still sleeping, I pumped it out for later use. Unlike manual breast 
pumps, the industrial pump is very gentle on your skin and does the job really 
quickly. I tried 2 manual once, couldn't stand them. I was also advised not to 
breast feed my baby for a week to see if breast milk was the culprit. I went 
right back to nursing Jodi when the expedition made no difference to her E. I 
also stopped drinking milk myself when I resumed breast feeding. Though Jodi's 
E is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, I think it's worth testing to 
see if your E baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula 
with Alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or 
milk sugar or soy if you could. Speaking from experience, I believe breast milk 
is the best for babies. Don't give it up just because your dr asks you to.</p>
<p>Tina - I suppose when it comes atopy, the bottom line is really bad genes. 
Did you try Head &amp; Shoulder? I notice that when I wash Jodi's hair 
everyday, her E clears up on her scalp.</p>
<p>Sue - I absolutely agree with you that games are the best for E babies. 
Since Jodi doesn't like to lie on her belly, and seems to like standing up like 
everyone else in the family, one of our favorite games is that while I sit in 
the center of a couch, I ask Jodi to get a toy from one end of the couch and 
give it to me. Then, I'll have Juliet puts the toy to the other end so Jodi 
will have to go fetch it again. Being right in the center of the couch allows 
me to stop Jodi from falling when she loses her balance. This game keeps both 
girls happy and they both have my attention.</p>
<p>Shanon - I'm beginning to believe it's something in the air which cause 
Jodi her E. We're moving the end of this month. I hope it's THE right move for 
Jodi. I'm thinking about getting someone to do a comprehensive air testing in 
our new home. Hopefully, Jodi's E will get better. I never thought my E may 
come back to haunt me but is not so sure anymore. The last time I had a flare 
up was 2 weeks before I gave birth to Juliet, my older one. I had it really bad 
all over my belly but it went away as soon as I gave birth to Juliet. I 
sometimes wonder if I had had a flare up when I was pregnant with Jodi, she 
would not have had her E.</p> Date: 21 Feb 1997 11:45:22 From: Tina Subject: 
Itchy heads and new clothes
<p>Thanks to all who wrote about kid's scalps. Daniel's head looks really bad. 
I am going to try Head and Shoulders first, since there is some of that in my 
bathroom already. Then we'll see the results. I was kind of concerned about it 
being strong and burning his raw spots. Then if that doesn't work I will look 
for the Nutregena T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About new clothes. Daniel has broke out after wearing an outfit that was 
new at Christmas and it was washed before he wore it... but maybe the load was 
too big and didn't get rinsed thoroughly. Our allergist said there are 
chemicals in the clothes to make them hang nicely on the racks... I use to work 
in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard 
would make me red and itchy---I don't have E.</p>
<p>Sue, Thanks for the imput on E, allergies and asthma. I really do hope that 
nothing else develops over time. I have hard enough time with the food and 
itching. Sometimes I just feel totally overwhelmed with the whole situation. My 
husband actually has more of an understanding than I do since he has E. He 
remembers when he was a toddler that he use to take a receiving blanket and 
wrap it around his arms so he wouldn't scratch too hard. Sad. His Mom kept a 
piece of it in his scapbook... She thinks he just loved his blankie...&nbsp;</p>
Date: 21 Feb 1997 20:21:01 From: Faith Subject: What's next
<p>Sue writes something that struck a nerve with me. </p>
<p>Exactly. I think that, in general, with most chronic problems, modern 
western medicine seems to do just this. The question I have is how do we find 
someone who *can* help us work toward the cause?? I mentioned a week or two ago 
that I was going to push my dermatologist in this direction, and I have had a 
start down that road. He drew blood for one set of tests, and has me scheduled 
for an allergy patch test (aagh! can't use the antihistamines for 2 days before 
or the 2 days during, no baths or showers during... I'm gonna be a mess!). If 
something shows up, he'll see what he can do to help it. If not, he said 
something that I noted immediately -- &quot;We'll just have to call it eczema, 
and you'll just have to live with it&quot;.</p>
<p>What that tells me is, if we don't come up with anything in this round of 
testing, I'll just have to drop the guy and move on to the next doctor, or 
naturopath, or whatever. He can call it whatever he wants -- that doesn't mean 
I have to &quot;just live with it&quot;! The trick is finding the next 
specialist to move to...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sue also mentioned something that she had done with Isaac (and I note many 
of the other parents on here are doing), where she breaks him away from 
scratching, but in a loving, helpful way. Anybody got any ideas on how I can 
teach my husband to do that??? I think I need to sit down with him and tell him 
that his blunt &quot;stop that scratching&quot; doesn't help me stop. As I told 
him once, &quot;You're easier to ignore than the itch is... &quot; Yes, I know 
that my scratching is making things worse. Yes, I know that my scratching is 
just prolonging the flare-up. And yes, I know my scratching is probably keeping 
him awake at night as much as it does me. But there's a BIG difference between 
knowing and being able to do something about it, sometimes... and feeling like 
I have to hide my scratching or get lectured only makes things worse... I like 
the suggestion someone made of getting a backrub to take one's mind away from 
the scratching! :) And frankly, now that I think about it... there are some 
other things he has done in the past that have taken my mind off the 
scratching, too... &lt; blush blush &gt; :) :)</p>
<p>Anyways, just had to get that off my chest...&nbsp; </p> Date: 21 Feb 1997 
15:52:03 From: Heather Subject: The helpfulness of &quot;Don't SCRATCH!&quot;
<p>When I start scratching, I immediately put some lotion on, or anti-itch 
cream (Sarna) or steroid ointment, depending on how the E. looks (dry, bumpy, 
etc.). My fiance does this for me if I can't reach the itchy spot, and I find 
that putting something on it really does help. Also, We sometimes play a game 
where I hug him if I'm still itchy after putting lotion on; I hug him as many 
times as I feel itchy. It does take my mind off the itchiness! He tells me not 
to scratch, which is helpful when I'm not aware that I'm doing it.</p> Date: 21 
Feb 1997 13:38:40 From: Tina Subject: Stop Scratching
<p>I know that backrubs help Daniel, too. Sometimes when he is scratching alot 
I lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs. I guess kind of a 
softer form of scratching since a 16 mo old can't understand softer. He will 
lay there as long as I want to rub. Using Eucerin after bath time, he likes the 
rub down also.</p>
<p>Do any of the children out there use their teeth to scratch themselves? 
Daniel scrubs his teeth along his wrists and hands... this makes them look 
pretty raw and swollen on top of the normal dry and cracking. It is very hard 
to get him to stop once he gets going.</p>
<p>Sue and Faith-----our first Dr. said of Daniel's bad skin----he just has 
Eczema, like his Dad. There would't be any allergies, not many kids really have 
allergies. It was my husband and I who pursued seeing an allergist and seeing 
if anything was actually causing it or at least making it worse than it really 
had to be. Behold, he has all sorts of food allergies! Peanut being bad enough 
to need to tote the Epi-Pen! Makes me wonder sometimes...&nbsp;</p> Date: 21

<p>Where did you find the Nature's Biotics site? I found it LONG ago, but lost 
it, and can't find it. The stuff is great though. I could see a substantial 
effect within only a few days of taking it. The problem is that you MUST take 
it the way it says, or it will cease to have an effect. My problem is that I 
cannot financially afford the dosage that it asks. I have noticed that since I 
have kept it at the two capsules a day, it has had no more effect, and its 
effect has actually lessened. It's great stuff though, at least from my 
observations.</p> Date: 21 Feb 1997 17:16:40 From: Christopher Subject: Stop 
Scratching
<p>Well, now that you mention it, yes, at one time I *did* use my teeth to 
scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when I 
started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply NOT SCRATCHING even 
though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin 
supplements. I thought I was the only one who did that. My parents called me a 
&quot;vampire.&quot; &lt;g&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though it is not one of the most pleasant things in the world, it is not as 
bad for the skin in my opinion as just plain scratching. And in truth, it was 
much more effective in stopping the itching than many of the treatments the 
doctors prescribed. &lt;g&gt; But seriously, I know what he is going through. 
And if later he thinks having eczema as a child is bad, wait until he gets to 
become a teenager. Thanks be to God that there are actually some beautiful 
females my age out there who don't care that much about looks (and 
subsequently, will date me). But hey, I wish him luck, and I know EXACTLY what 
he is going through.&nbsp;</p> Date: 21 Feb 1997 20:11:20 From: Ralph Subject:

stay on here because all the info is so interesting and because I know sooner

I had a problem was in the fall when I had a scare with my mammogram. So there

<p>I had that patch test (T.R.U.E. I believe) done twice and it showed 
nothing. It cost $400.00 each time too. Yesterday I went and had some food 
allergy testing done and once again NOTHING. They also did a blood test to test 
my thyroid. I hate to say this but I hope something show up, at least I would 
know what is causing this. I know what you mean when you talk about scratching 
during the night. Last week during a nighttime scratching frenzy (must have 
taken the socks off my hands!) I tore part of a mole off. I then had to go have 
it removed which was real pleasant. My regular dermatologist was in Hawaii 
(probably funded by me) and the doctor filling in for him actually joked with 
me about my eczema. I kinda let him have it. This really gets frustrating. I 
hope your patch test shows something.</p> Date: 22 Feb 1997 02:06:34 From:

<p>Has anyone looked at the &quot;Cutaneous Drug Reaction Database&quot; at 
Dartmouth? gopher://gopher.dartmouth.edu:70/11/Research/BioSci/CDRD</p>
<p>Almost all drugs have side effects of dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis,

<p>I developed eczema after taking an antibiotic. It was necessary - nothing I 
could do about it. I wonder though, if we are not perpetuating the problem, by 
taking these legal drugs so often. I have had rashes, pityriasis rosea and 
eczema. These skin diseases always show up after I take a drug for awhile.

<p>Faith: You have already have some answers to your own question, as noted 
above. It's good that you've recognized the problem. Now you need to find the 
right time to talk to your husband about how he can help you. Pick a time when 
there are no other distractions and he can give you his full attention. Just 
open the conversation saying something like &quot;Honey, I figured out 
something important about my skin and I need your help with it. You know how I 
scratch in the night? Well, what I think would help me to stop is if you 
could... &quot; Spell out the details about specifics that he could do (without 
saying anything about his actions in the past NOT being helpful) and then ask 
him &quot;What do you think? Does this sound like something you could do? Or is 
there some part that wouldn't work for you?&quot; and just have a frank 
discussion about the situation, what works and doesn't work, without blaming 
each other for anything.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty bringing up the subject, try practicing either by 
yourself or with a friend. Or here online with the group. If you can open the 
conversation, you can bring some improvement to the situation. And every bit 
helps. You are fortunate in having a loved one who is there for support. They

&quot;Lose Weight!&quot; or &quot;Stop Smoking!&quot; I expect he would not 
only not find it likely to help him, but he'd find it debilitating. Shoe on 
other foot?&nbsp;</p> Date: 22 Feb 1997 15:49:17 From: Christopher Subject: 
hello again
<p>What I find the hardest to deal with is the &quot;dryness&quot; of the skin 
(as well as in the past, the &quot;cracking, blotchiness, and bleeding&quot;). 
It is NOT the most pleasant thing in the world, especially if you date fairly 
regularly. &lt;g&gt; My eczema was most active on my hands, and feet, though at 
times it attacked my ears badly.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, my allergist never recommended zinc (which does quite 
well), nor any of the vitamins I take. When I suggested them one time while 
talking with him, he shrugged them off. I tried them anyway, and I have had 
great success. &lt;g&gt;</p> Date: 23 Feb 1997 09:51:53 From: Wayne Subject:

<p>I found a posting I made to this list on Sep 10, 95 that refers to a 
warning I read about in the National Psoriasis Foundation's Pharmacy Newsletter 
(v6#2, Jul 94, p9). This is what the NPF warning s says: &quot;Do you take 
either terfenadine, an allergy medicine sold as Seldane, or ketoconazole, which 
is used to treat skin infections? If so, you should know the following. Recent 
research has shown that when combined, these two medications can cause fatal 
changes in heart rhythm. So never take these two medications together. For more 
information, contact your physician.&quot; Note that Seldane is an 
antihistamine that is not supposed to make you sleepy, and the ketoconazole, I 
assume, is an antibiotic (because the warning mentions that it is used to treat 
skin infections).</p> Date: 23 Feb 1997 23:07:16 From: Faith Subject: Faith's 
Delimma
<p>Thanks, everyone, for some great ideas on how to deal with my husband on 
this. I think Patsy's given me the one angle that's going to help me help him 
understand, though!</p>
<p>Putting the shoe on the other foot may indeed strike a nerve with him. His 
mother was after him, for many years, to lose weight. Every time we saw her 
over those years, it was inevitable that she would, at some point in the visit, 
bring up the matter of his weight, either with him directly or through me. It 
got to a point where he avoided seeing her at all, simply to keep her from 
harassing him about it. Ultimately, he has managed to lose much of the weight 
(and she's quite proud of him for it!), but it had nothing to do with her 
harassment and everything to do with finding a way to do it that he could live 
with.</p>
<p>If I can explain to him that I want very much to stop scratching, but need 
to find a way to do it that I can live with, as he needed to do with his 
weight, then I believe he will understand. And given that I'm in the middle of 
a particularly itchy flare-up at the moment, this may come in handy...&nbsp;</p>

light, not greasy, and gives your skin a cooling sensation. I've found it near 
the cortisone creams and calamine lotion in the pharmacy, but it doesn't have 
any steroids or other drugs in it. You might ask your pharmacist if s/he can 
order it; my dermatologist suggested it to me.</p> Date: 24 Feb 1997 10:45:49

<p>The long leafy greens are only available in China town. I don't know their 
names in English since they are indigenous in China. But I know they are 
usually used as the steamed veggies to go with soup noodles. The whole veggie 
is of the same shade of green. The two Jodi likes the most are light green and 
dark green. Both have very long leaves and what I do is snip the leaves off and 
steam them together. After I steamed the veggie, I cut the stem in 3-4 inches a 
piece and give them to the girls as finger food. The leaves I puree and mix 
with her rice and meat. They love it 'cos the veggies are slightly sweet. Jodi 
has no problem with carrots. She does have a reaction to green peas though. I 
also use Beechnut and not Gerber.</p>
<p>I also give Jodi a multi vitamin drop by TwinLab but only when she doesn't 
eat right. I think the name of the drop is called Infant Care Vitamin Drop. The 
health food store I go to sells it for $4.19. I don't give her the drop very 
often since her appetite is mostly good.</p>
<p>I thought about dust mites. Our mattresses are wrapped and cleaned often. 
Our furnishings are either leather or wood, no fabrics, drapes nor carpets. The 
only possibility may be the vent. Our building is 5 years old. Central air may

Subject: Sarna/central heating
<p>Someone mentioned something called Sarna as an anti-itch lotion that gives 
the skin a &quot;cooling sensation.&quot; I have long believed that any 
lubricant that produces a cooling sensation is actually drying the skin (the 
cool you feel is the water leaving the skin). If it works for YOU, great! But 
be aware of what a cooling sensation means for some of us.</p>
<p>Rita, You are probably correct to suspect that the central heating in your 
building brings in dust and mold. Sometimes stray cats live in basements of 
buildings and their dander gets into the heating system and bothers 
cat-allergic tenants who THINK that they don't live with cats! And even if a 
central heater is free of all allergens, the air itself is so dry that it can 
irritate already dry skin.&nbsp;</p> Date: 24 Feb 1997 15:30:55 From: Alex

<p>As I was reading the archives and comparing notes I came across the eczema 
&amp; cold subject. Some of you said that when your eczema is bad you rarely 
get sick and visa versa. This is something that definitely seems to happen with 
me. The flu and viruses go around and I just don't catch them. The conclusion, 
I guess, is that the immune system is fighting so hard when the skin is bad and 
it stops fighting as hard when the skin is clear so we're more susceptible to 
colds.</p>
<p>For the last 2 weeks my eczema had been more clear than it has been in 
years but I've had a horrible cold - the first one in as long as I can 
remember. The funny thing is that I think I prefer the coughing, sneezing, 
stuffy nose &amp; headaches to the all over eczema I had been experiencing. I 
feel more alive (happier with more energy) when I'm sick and have clear skin 
than when I'm well with rashes.</p>
<p>Now that my cold is finally subsiding I am starting to get itchy again and 
I am getting some red rashes on my legs. I thought for a little while there 
that maybe the eczema was gone for good- okay so it was a naive fantasy but 
it's nice to feel like a normal human being once in a while.</p> Date: 24 Feb 
1997 16:48:43 From: Royce Subject: Child ECZEMA
<p>Reading the messages, especially from all the moms on this list, brings 
back memories of my own childhood. The thought of your children and the many 
other children with severe eczema brought tears to my eyes. It's horrible to 
suffer with something and go through so much to try and find the cause (usually 
to no avail). I remember my parents trying every doctor in town. At that time, 
I went to various dermatologists and allergists. I'm now 29 but thought I'd 
share some information on my experiences. I just joined the group so I'm not 
sure how much of this you've already heard and I'm not sure how much can apply 
to infants but here goes...</p>
<p>Last year I went to a holistic medical center and the doctor said that I 
had leaky gut syndrome among other things. He said to do the following:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> take L-Glutamine (approx. 4000mg per day) to strengthen the walls of the 
stomach&nbsp;</li> 
<li> drink grapefruit juice (about 1/2 cup per day)- I forgot why but I can 
find out if you are interested (just a side note: I am allergic to citric acid 
and can't eat too much fruit but the small amount of grapefruit juice didn't 
aggravate my eczema)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> take Borage Oil or Flax seed oil (or any essential fatty acid- the 
essential oils are supposed to be good for the skin) as well as other vitamins 
to strengthen the immune system. I mix 1 tbs. of flax seed oil with soy milk 
(if soy is a problem then just try to find another protein to take it with). I 
don't take too many vitamins at the moment even though it's what they recommend.
</li> </ol> Also my DHEA level was low so he gave me 25mg DHEA pills to take. 
From what I understand DHEA regulates the hormone levels in your body. Since 
stress can be a factor (with me it has been a variety of stresses) I was told 
that when the DHEA levels are off they can cause hormonal stresses on the body 
which can aggravate the eczema (this was happening to me as I got older so this 
may not apply for children).
<p>I was also tested for Candida Yeast and had to stay away from a lot of 
yeasty or fermented foods (which I still try to do because those foods seem to 
aggravate my skin). I stay away from tomatoes and other citrus foods too.</p>
<p>Itching: I have horrible scratching fits in the middle of night and used to 
use Benedryl cream (which my doctor said is bad to use). I have recently 
discovered evaporation (it seems to take away the itch the majority of the 
time). I put an emollient (I like Theraplex Emollient by Medics Dermatologists 
Inc.) and zinc oxide ointment or a cortisone cream on the area(s) then I take a 
white cotton dress shirt (wet it and wring it out) and wrap it around the 
area(s) and then lay a towel down on the bed (so it doesn't get wet) it usually 
helps the itch so I can go back to sleep and the area is much less irritated in 
the morning. I've tried to wear gloves (or socks) on my hands to prevent 
scratching but they're usually off by the time I wake up.</p>
<p>Also, I've been using medications &amp; moisturizers for all these years 
that have been causing breakouts. I just found out that I can't use some 
moisturizers, shampoos or detergents if they contain certain irritating 
ingredients like lanolin and propylene glycol so that may be something to check 
out too. I'm thinking of getting allergy tested for common irritants.</p>
<p>I tried a chiropractor but didn't notice any change. If it helps anyone 
please let me know.</p>
<p>I've experimented with a lot of other doctors and treatments (ie 
reflexology, polarity, acupuncture, PUVA light and probably others that I'm 
forgetting) so if you're interested in the outcome of any of these just let me 
know.</p> Date: 24 Feb 1997 17:09:25 From: Royce Subject: ECZEMA!! HELP (fwd) 
<p>I take L-Lysine (1000mg) and Zinc (30mg) 1x per day with meals. I used to 
take a lot of vitamins but it was too much for my system to handle so I figured 
I'd start with a couple that I heard are good for E and add on gradually. A 
friend of mine gets really bad cold sores on her lip a couple of times a year 
and she takes mega doses of L-Lysine. She swears by it- says it makes the cold

Amarjit Subject: bathing
<p>Tina, Despite our Pediatricians advice about not bathing/shower the child 
more than once a week we always did it at least once a day because there was 
clear relief to my son. Twice a day baths started after we talked to a doctor 
whose work on allergy is referenced in most allopathic books and articles on 
allergy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to him several years ago it was believed that avoiding water 
contact helps the skin because essential skin oils are NOT lost. In the last 
few years, research showed that it is the moisture in the skin and NOT skin oil 
that keeps the skin healthy, therefore, he suggested that soak the child in 
water for 1/2 hour (twice a day) and then apply a thick layer of Vaseline or 
Aquaphor to lock in the moisture. We have been doing this for the last six 
months. In the first two-three weeks there was visible difference. He has 
improved even more since but we have done several other things :</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Bath oil from Ruth Foundation in UK&nbsp;</li> 
<li> Flax seed oil and evening primrose oil&nbsp;</li> 
<li> Homeopathy&nbsp;</li> 
<li> For cooking only coconut oil works for him (and maybe Safflower oil) (for 
a long time I believed (partially convinced by Pediatric allergist) that oil is 
100% fat and therefore there is no protein and should be ok but this is only 
theoretically true)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> Tried all kinds of things for his scalp but nothing worked as well as 
aloe vera gel (by the way we used this to cool his skin down and to relieve him 
from itching all over his body when he was 1 year old but now he refuses it to 
be applied to his body now that he is 3 1/2)</li> </ol> Date: 24 Feb 1997 
21:36:40 From: Tina Subject: teeth for scratching and more
<p>To Carol and Christopher and anyone else who use their teeth for 
scratching----Thanks for writing back. I was wondering if Daniel was the only 
one who did that. Adults actually do it too. Is there a way to keep him from 
doing it, especially in the car. Of course, he is still in a car seat, so he 
doesn't have a lot to do in there. Toys don't seem to help, food does sometimes 
if he hasn't already worked himself into a frenzy. At 16 mos though, food is 
quite messy. Sometimes blaring the stereo works...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christopher--About the vitamin thing. Our allergist just said to put Daniel 
on a children's chewable in case he isn't getting enough iron. He is up to a 
full 23 pounds now. He is still low on the growth chart though.</p>
<p>Amarjit--thanks for the advice on the aloe vera gel for Daniel's scalp. We 
were still under the impression not to overbathe him. Does two baths a day 
really help? We only give a bath once to twice a week, I know it will become 
more frequent with spring on the way. The kids will be out getting dirty!!!!!
</p> Date: 24 Feb 1997 19:08:29 From: Patsy Subject: Lycine 
<p>Interesting stuff about the L-Lycine. I'd never thought of using it for 
eczema. I keep it on hand to take when I feel a fever blister coming on. If 
taken in large enough doses as soon as that first tingle starts, it'll usually 
stop a fever blister from forming, or at least keep it from getting so 
big.&nbsp;</p> Date: 24 Feb 1997 22:40:00 From: Larry Subject: bathing and E 
moms
<p>A number of you have been debating the bathing issue, how many times per 
day, hot water, cold water, etc.</p>
<p>Dermatologists will typically tell you that you should avoid hot water and 
don't bath too often because it will dry out the skin. (At least this is what 
every dermatologist I've ever seen has said.)</p>
<p>The latest Dr. I've seen said the same thing. I told him that I feel much 
better using hot water, and when my skin is really bad, bathing multiple times 
during the day helps a lot. He explained to me that the traditional advice 
tends to work for most people (for you scientists and mathematicians, it's the 
old bell shaped curve). There are however those of us who are not in the middle 
of the bell curve (one or more standard deviations out). Basically, do what 
works for you. I think this is the only consistent advice that I've heard from 
doctors and sufferers. This is probably a fundamental truth about life in 
general.</p>
<p>For all you E moms, From what I've heard, you are all doing the right 
things. My mom and dad put up with 3 of us with severe E problems - the 
constant scratching, the infections, the skin all over the beds, the bloody 
sheets, seeing dr. after dr., and worst of all seeing your child suffer. I 
never thought much about what they put up with before, but in retrospect, my 
parents were remarkable folks. The best comfort for your suffering kids is your 
love and concern. Keep up your search for solutions and trust that you will 
find a way to control the problem.</p> Date: 26 Feb 1997 09:37:19 UT From: 
Elizabeth Subject: Childhood Eczema
<p>My 14 year old son has had chronic, severe eczema all his life. Reading 
your comment that this conditon is not life threatening, I would like to say 
that it can at times come close. Infections are so easy to contract with 
eczema. He has had many skin infections and twice had bone infections, a very 
sick boy at the time. The antibiotics he takes become less and less effective 
each time. Other times eczema can cause such unhappiness in your child you 
worry about his state of mind.</p>
<p>Allergy testing was less than helpful. He was allergic to everything. The 
best way seems to be to try and work it. He can tolerate milk well but has 
trouble with red food colours.</p>
<p>In the past year he has had some help with using Evening Primrose Oil but 
we don't really have any support on how to use it to the best effect. Is there 
any information on this?</p>
<p>His 12 year old brother as a baby was even worse, he failed to thrive for 
some time which seems to be caused by his allergies, but he is OK now with 
beautiful skin, thank goodness.</p> Date: 25 Feb 1997 10:33:45 From: Linda 
Subject: ECZEMA Digest
<p>My child's derm. told me to bathe my son every day with warm water. Every 
day seems like a lot so I usually do it every other day. The only benefit I 
know of re: bathing every day is that right after a bath is the best time to 
apply medication/ointments. I've read that its good to bathe often for water to 
enter into the skin; however, I still believe the healing takes place from the 
inside-out.&nbsp;</p> Date: 25 Feb 1997 06:15:10 From: Steve Subject: Time till 
reactions?
<p>Hello Michael, Your question is prime. The answer varies with the degree of 
allergic reaction that occurs. If you are mortally allergic, you will know 
within one or two seconds. There will be no doubt. Many or most food allergic 
reactions that are the hardest to detect occur the next day or even worse, only 
after eating the allergen for several days. Detecting these can only be 
accomplished by eliminating the &quot;suspect&quot; for several days and then 
reintroducing it for several days. This is time consuming and a big nuisance, 
but in too many cases it is the only way to discover the allergen and then 
finally get relief by eliminating it from your diet. Life is matter of degrees, 
trial and error, adjusting, and making choices. The more we adjust and choose 
health the healthier we become. I keep telling this to myself.</p> Date: 25 Feb

<p>For a couple of days now we have given Daniel (16 mos) a bath every other 
night, and used Head and Shoulders. His scalp looks a little better not so 
flaky, he is still scratching it alot though. His skin is really red and 
chapped looking on his face and base of his neck. Could this be the H and S, 
too strong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also ran out of Eucerin and bought Cetaphil cream instead. After using 
the Cetaphil his face looks bad within an hour, the Eucerin seemed to last 3 or 
4. I have started looking for Aquaphor, but have had no luck yet. Friday I have 
all day I can shop. We are also going shopping to perfect his diet off of his 
list. We have been allowing wheat again and that could be causing some of this. 
The only time he was ever totally clear was when he took antihistimines twice a 
day, hydrocortizone on his face three times a day and Desinide on his body 
three times a day. Of course we don't want to do that to him. Last night was 
pretty unbearable for the whole family----he does't get too upset, just 
scratches all night---I guess because he doesn't really know any different yet. 
I feel so bad for him... hope everyone is feeling better than we are today!</p>

<p>My daughter's dermatologist said to bathe her only every 3rd night. 
However, the allergist said to let her in the tub every night, then apply the 
medications. So, we have been doing this. She seems to feel much better, and 
her skin isn't nearly as dry.</p> Date: 25 Feb 1997 18:50:25 From: Karen 
Subject: FW: Childhood Eczema
<p>Elizabeth, So sorry your son has had so many terrible infections as a 
result of his eczema. I did not intend to trivialize the effect that eczema has 
on its sufferers. You're correct that infections that invade the bones or blood 
stream can be very serious and sometimes deadly. However, my comment that 
things could be worse and about eczema not being life-threatening was intended 
to mean that I'm thankful my daughter has something that's basically treatable 
for the most part and she is not dying of leukemia like one of her young 
cousins is.</p>
<p>From the other postings I've read on this list regarding allergy 
testing/treatments, it seems that again my daughter is very fortunate and 
perhaps is the exception to the rule since now that we've identified specific 
allergens and are undertaking efforts to eliminate them, she is doing much 
better. The eczema still flares from time to time but it's not nearly as bad as 
it was before testing.</p>
<p>I have heard of using evening primrose oil but have not used it on my 
daughter, so I can't comment further on it. Perhaps someone who has used it 
will shed some light on its use and effects?</p>
<p>From what I'm reading on this list also, it seems that a treatment that may 
work for one person's eczema may not work so well for another's. I guess each 
has to find what will work for him/her and go with that. In spite of this, I 
feel that we should share what treatments work for us (or our children) so 
others will know of possible options.</p>
<p>I hope a viable solution to your son's eczema will be found soon. </p>

Subject: Cetaphil products - beware!
<p>Tina, Sorry to hear about your family's misery. Last night I realized that 
my son had chapped hands (he and his brother have recently developed some mild 
dryness and itch problems). I had some samples of Cetaphil lotion and cream so 
I gave him the lotion. Within a minute he complained of itchiness. I use 
Cetaphil cleanser with no trouble on my worst skin areas so I (stupidly) didn't 
read the ingredients on the lotion until his itch began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ingredients included a lot of strange sounding chemicals and macadamia 
NUT oil. I am deadly allergic to nuts and would have never allowed the sample 
in the house had I known what it contained. The cream contained strange 
chemicals and sweet ALMOND oil. Both samples went right into the trash and we 
rinsed Allan's hands and applied Eucerin cream. Today his hands are soft again. 
Wish my skin could be cleared that easily and safely!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moral of this story is to ALWAYS read ingredients, even on products you 
have used before. Someone once told me that as a person with severe allergies, 
I should read ingredient labels 3 times: first, when I buy the product; second, 
when I put it on the shelf at home; third, when I start to use the product. 
Often, people don't catch a suspect ingredient until the 3rd reading.</p>
<p>P.S. I really like Eucerin cream; it has few ingredients; the white color 
tones down the redness; and it is heavy but not super greasy. It does contain a 
lanolin derivative so some eczema patients stay away from it.</p> Date: 26 Feb

<p>Air pollution linked to skin ailments - study&nbsp; </p>
<p>Air pollution can rob skin of an important vitamin, aggravating a variety 
of skin ailments common to people in urban areas, according to a study released 
Tuesday. The University of California at Berkeley study, which was conducted on 
mice, concluded ozone rapidly strips vitamin E from the uppermost layer of 
skin. This vitamin is a key component of healthy skin, the scientists said. The 
finding may help explain why urban living can aggravate skin ailments like 
dermatitis, which results in itchy, inflamed and scaly skin.</p>

<p>One of the best things for infection is sun. It prevents and clears 
infection. The very best is sun and ocean water, if the skin can tolerate the 
salt. There is some research about sun therapy for eczema, but I cannot guide 
you to it. Sun between 11 am and 1 pm, starting with about 10 minutes is 
effective. Ice used afterwards will relieve discomfort from sweating. Of course 
too much sun will be a problem, but carefully timed and gradually increased 
amounts is safe and effective. Be sure to have vitamin D and a balance of other 
vitamins and minerals.</p> Date: 26 Feb 1997 12:06:44 From: Jessica Subject:

<p>I strongly agree with Jolie, we moms got to do our best to let our little 
ones feel a little bit comfortable.</p>
<p>Reading all those writing from other moms, I couldn't hold my tears for a 
lot of time. We have been fighting with my son's eczema so hard since he was 
two months old (he is 10-months last week), the only improvement we experienced 
is switching his formula to Allimentum and on stricted diet. But he still has 
eczema on his legs, neck and face, still trying to scratch them all the time.
</p>
<p>To prevent infection from scratching, we never leave him alone for a 
minute, even when he is sleeping in the evening. But the bad luck still came to 
us two weeks ago, he got herpes infection! his eczema made that the worst, he 
got herpes eczema all over his face just in a couple of days, then started 
spreading to his body, he got fever too, he had to stay in the Baby Hospital 
for one week and take medicine by mouth for another week, the doctors treated 
him very aggressively in case the virus spread into his blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally it got controlled, but still we have no clue what caused the herpes 
infection, he always stays at home with Grandma, the only difference I can 
recall is bringing him to a party, then a restaurant around those days, that 
may be where he got the virus; Doctors say things definitely would not get this 
bad if he had no eczema, eczema wake his skin, give the virus a chance to get 
in. We decide no party, no restaurant until he is one-year old when his immune 
system is stronger.</p>
<p>His food group: white rice, yellow rice, rice, cereal, most vegetables 
(spinach, carrot, broccoli, squash, napa), apple, apple juice, chicken; I would 
like to try veal next.</p> Date: 26 Feb 1997 13:21:01 From: Lorena Subject:

<p>Jessica, Sorry to hear about your son's recent herpes infection. You may 
have read my story in the archives, but in case you haven't - the exact same 
thing happened to me when I was about 15 months old. My mother had a cold sore 
on her lip at the time so we assume that's where I got the infection. That was 
50 years ago and it took the doctors a long time to diagnose me; so I was in 
really bad shape and almost didn't make it. I still get cold sores just about 
everywhere, but never again a massive infection. My eczema was all-over severe 
as an infant and toddler, but it lessened to occasional, easy-to-manage patches 
until my mid 40s. So there's the chance that your son will get lots better, 
hopefully forever. You are doing so much for him.&nbsp;</p> Date: 26 Feb 1997

taking cyclosporine for a year and wasn't itchy. And you know what, I didn't 
scratch!!!!!! I realized that maybe it didn't have to do with will-power or 
habit. Maybe it just itched. I find that the best thing for me from my wife is 
that she just accept that I am constantly in motion touching here and 
scratching there. I ask her from time to time, how she can stand it. She says 
that she doesn't even notice. I find that having the freedom to do whatever I

<p>Shelley - Zemaphyte is indeed available in Canada through the Emergency 
Drug Release Program. Per my contact at Phytopharm, information about Zemaphyte 
is sent out to drs in Canada when requested. Phytopharm is trying to register 
Zemaphyte as a prescription drug and is currently conducting clinical studies 
in Canada. Anyone who are interested in the pill can find a dr in Canada who 
would contact the Emergency Drug Release Program to request for it. Again, it's 
only available by prescription through the Emergency Drug Release Program. The 
company is still working with the FDA on Zemaphyte's clinical studies in the 
U.S.</p>
<p>A Zemaphyte pill is about 4mm in diameter. The pills are taken several 
times a day. Adult dosage costs about 68 pounds sterling for a week's 
prescription. She also claims Zemaphyte is tested to have the same efficacy as 
the decoction brewed using the traditional method and is not bitter at all. 
It's not recommended for children under 3 years of age and one can only take it 
continuously for no more than 12 weeks. I wonder if any eczema sufferers in the 
U.K. have tried Zemaphyte? Perhaps they can tell us more since Zemaphyte has 
been approved as a prescription drug in the U.K.</p>

<p>I've used various oils including sesame. My skin seems to tolerate any oil 
except baby oil. Someone recommended flax seed oil but I didn't notice any 
great results- orally yes but topically no. I use vitamin E oil right after I 
shower, while my skin is still wet (I just kind of drip dry and let the oil dry 
with my skin, as towels irritate me).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I put on 2 products which I swear by- Theraplex emollient and 
Theraplex clear lotion by Medics Dermatologics, Inc. in Phoenix, AZ # 
800-845-1313. You can order the products straight from the company or ask your 
pharmacist to order them for you. They're about $10-11 each but I think it's 
worth it. The clear lotion is a mineral and jojoba type oil (with petroleum 
fraction &amp; something else - sorry I don't have the bottle here) which I am 
surprised I can tolerate because many people claim mineral oil is no good. 
These are great moisturizers that my derm. recommended to me years ago and they 
are the only moisturizers I have used for a long period of time that don't 
irritate my skin (quite soothing actually).</p>
<p>But as we all know everyone is different. One thing I find interesting 
about these products is that they are made with a petroleum fraction and I 
can't tolerate petroleum itself. I assume it's different (that fraction must be 
okay for my skin).&nbsp;</p> Date: 26 Feb 1997 15:19:52 From: Tina Subject:

<p>Every derm. I ever went to said not to bathe for too long or too often but 
I never listened. Like someone else on the list suggested, I think you have to 
do what works for you. If I don't bathe everyday my skin feels horrible. It 
gets dry, flaky, itchy... Sometimes I can skip one day but only when my skin is 
in good condition. When I shower I actually feel relief. Really hot water is 
bad but for me hydrating the skin and moisturizing immediately after is good. 
Another reason I feel that I need to bathe everyday is to get rid of the 
bacteria that I think can build up with the use of all the heavy emollients and 
creams I use- I'm sure this bacteria makes the skin itch more. When you're an 
itchy person the thought of this can make your skin crawl (it does mine).</p>
<p>This is probably not the best thing to do but I use an exfoliating body 
glove on the rough dry spots. It's the only thing that gets rid of that flaky 
skin for me. As long as I don't rub too long or hard &amp; irritate my skin it 
can actually make it feel soft (even normal sometimes).</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 
11:19:25 From: Alvaro Subject: E Baby moms
<p>I think I am a bit different... I am an E baby Dad. After reading so much 
about other parents flighting their baby's eczema, I would like to voice some 
of my techniques I have used to help my now 20 months baby (BTW, he has had 
eczema since birth).</p>
<p>First of all, we find eczema on different parts of the body signifies 
different causes. Body and face seems to caused by food allergies (from 
internal) whereas arms, legs from dust ..etc (from external source). We found 
zinc + castor oil seems to help a lot for the arms and legs.</p>
<p>About baby scratching, we had a hard time on this one. Baby is baby, the 
only way you can help is try (very hard) to divert his/her attention from 
scratching during the day and wear one-piece &quot;body suit&quot; and use 
looong gloves (we use adult socks ) at night. We found wearing body suite helps 
a lot at night - it reduces the degree of damage from unintentional scratching 
and help to make sure he won't get cold (My baby will scratch everywhere - pull 
up his coat and scratch his stomach - during sleep.</p>
<p>One thing I found out is my wife and my eczema son both feel a lot warmer 
than me. According to my Chinese Dr, that is the cause of their eczema. The Dr 
's cure is some herb which lowers the &quot;fire&quot; in their body. The herb 
works very well for my wife ( I think she is more or less cured) but we have 
not yet dared give it to my son (because of his age ). The herbs (from my 
research) are quite lethal.</p> Date: 26 Feb 1997 19:23:42 From: Shanon 
Subject: Body Oil -Reply
<p>I have used Vaseline for a long time now. When I was young my dr said that 
the skin could absorb it better. I also used and still use Alpha Keri bath oil 
(wonderful stuff!!!), it's a little expensive for me though so I cut it with 
Mineral Oil. Check out the ingredients of a lot of cremes and bath oils, the 
number one ingredient is Mineral Oil. I use Mineral Oil to take my make-up off 
at night or as a &quot;night creme&quot;. If I'm really bad, I will take a bath 
with Alpha Keri bath oil and Mineral Oil or Canola Oil, then use Mineral Oil as 
a lotion when I get out, then Vaseline over that. I just slip right into bed 
after that...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently tried the Evening Primrose Oil and Cod Liver Oil and I am doing 
wonderfully. We also just purchased an ionizer for our house so I am not sure 
which has done the most good but I feel better than I have in years and went 
jogging at lunch today!! (sweat and all!!!!)</p>
<p>My personal opinion on the subject of bathing is... I take baths every day. 
I had a dr tell me once that I was washing away all my own body oils and that 
was why I had dry skin (obviously he has never had eczema). My body doesn't 
seem to produce much oil so I give it some with the Alpha Keri (getting a soft 
water service helped too!!). I think an eczema patient should do what makes 
them feel the best and bathing with bath oil is my salvation when my skin is 
bad. I feel more dry the longer I go without. I have also had infections in my 
eczema and don't ever want that again so I wash as much as I can.</p>
<p>Also, I have had a dr tell me how to tell if someone has eczema. He took a 
tongue depressor and touched the back of my throat with it and I had no 
reaction. He said that people without eczema would be gagging if he did that to 
them. He said that people with eczema do not have much if any gag reflex. I 
don't know why but with all the vitamins/antihistamines that I take, I'm glad 
that I don't gag.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a day, like I had today, NO ITCHING (I got so much done!)

<p>Royce, Thank you for your long message to us E. moms. I am glad to see I am 
not the only one to discuss leaky gut. My son was diagnosed with this at 4 
months old. He is on a very restricted diet as designated by the E baby foods 
message. Can you provide me with a list of your good foods? What is 
L-Glutamine? What are DHEA levels? How bad is your eczema? My son has it head 
to toe if not on this restricted diet. Will he get better? Are there daily 
vitamins you also take? I have so many questions. Was this a birth defect, 
leaky gut? Have you tried homeopathy? Chinese herbs? Have you ever heard of 
MSM, tried aloe vera or evening primrose? Since there are so many possible 
causes, a diagnosis the same as my son's is very excitng. I can also 
communicate successful products with an adult, the baby can't tell me if I am 
helping him!</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 05:30:31 From: Brigit Subject: Ribomunyl

<p>Ann, Did that herpes infection leave any scars on you? My son's face is

09:48:38 From: Lynn Subject: Cyclosporine
<p>Richard, You mentioned in yesterday's posting that you had taken 
cyclosporine for a year and didn't itch during that time. I was wondering if 
you had been prescribed it for the eczema, as one theory is that we have an 
overactive immune system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My derm -- having tried everything else (in orthodox medicine) -- wants to 
put me on Immuran, which is another immunosuppressant, but I am very wary. He 
says it's no worse (in terms of suppressing your immune system) than the 
prednisone (10 mg/day) that I have been taking for 13 years. But, to me at 
least, the prednisone is a known commodity: it did result in osteoporosis, but 
as far as my immune system goes, I rarely get sick, so don't think it is too 
depressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not you took the cyclosporine FOR the eczema, could you let us 
know whether you think it &quot;did the trick&quot; for your skin, and also 
whether you had other bad side effects from it. BTW, I agree with your 
observation that the primary reason that we scratch is because we itch, and 
bad. All the rest (habit, self-comfort) probably has a small role, but usually 
declines dramatically when the primary stimulus is gone.</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997

<p>When I was young, the ocean was wonderful for my skin. Getting in was tough 
because the salt water would burn but my mother would make me get in knowing 
the results would be good. So, remembering this, last summer I would go three 
days a week after work and go in the water but I would get worse. The water 
around here gets pretty contaminated from sewage (Ugh!!) but if any of you come 
to town, be sure and look me up!!! I'll take you to the HOT spots (Ha-Ha).</p> 
Date: 27 Feb 1997 11:56:46 From: Linda Subject: Evening Primrose Oil &amp; E 
moms/dads
<p>Hi everyone, I'm sure the E moms and dads can relate to this story -- I'm 
sorry but I have to &quot;let it out&quot; somehow. My 7 mos. old (Brian) woke 
up at 4 a.m. with bloody socks (which he had pulled off his hands). So when I 
turned on the lamp to look at the damages, I never expected what I saw -- the 
entire left side of his face and ear were red, bloody, and oozing. It almost 
looked like he had been burned. It looked awful and I was in tears big time! I 
washed his face gently and put some antibiotic cream (Neosporin) on it. He 
wanted to &quot;talk and play&quot; so it must not have been as painful as it 
looked. Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep last night because after I 
went back to bed, I was just too upset! I spoke to his doctor's office this 
morning, and they said to apply Neosporin 3 times today, and if it's not much 
better by tomorrow, bring him in. Things just can't go on this way for him. I 
really can't wait to get allergy tests done on him -- as a matter of fact, I 
think I'll call the allergist today to schedule an appt. Anyhow, hope you and 
your children have a good day!</p>
<p>Shanon, I've never tried Alpha Keri bath oil. I've always just used baby 
oil, but it doesn't really seem to help that much. I shower in the morning and 
then cover with baby oil and pat skin dry. I've never used the Vaseline 
petroleum jelly either -- wouldn't it be very messy to put on under my 
work/dress clothes? If you think it would be OK, I'll try it. Also, how did you 
try the Evening Primerose Oil and Cod Liver Oil -- orally or open capsule and 
apply to skin? I take the EPO capsules (usually 2 a day) when I remember.&nbsp;
</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 12:01:13 From: Kay Subject: Detergent-less disks 
<p>Kim asked me about the clothes washing disks. My observation is this: if 
you have an office job where you do not get TRULY dirty but just need to get 
off body odor, they are fine. They do not get dirt out of my husband's clothes 
(construction worker). They do not get the children's daily grime out, either.
</p>
<p>I have to use SHOUT on the clothes if I am to have any luck removing 
stains--especially anything tomato-based.. Georgia clay is impossible to remove 
without ritual sacrifice to the deity in charge of laundry.. (a little humor 
there!)</p>
<p>Shaklee Basic-H is pretty neat on bad stains and it is non-toxic. I can't 
afford to use it all the time, though.</p>
<p>So, Kim, the disks aren't effective for the real life dirt of active 
families. If you work in an office, I sure would give them a try.</p>
<p>Detergent didn't seem to be a big problem for that ol' EJ boy because we 
use ALL Free and Clear all the time, anyway. I now use 1/2 the amout I once did 
and the disks. I SHOUT the stains of the entire gang.</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 
09:40:47 From: Tina Subject: bad night-Linda
<p>Linda, I am so sorry you had such a bad night. When Daniel was that age 
(now 16 mos) blood was a fairly normal sight in the morning. I don't know if it 
was as bad as your experience of course. He scratched alot harder back then and 
I felt like putting socks on his hands just gave him rug burn. His skin used to 
ooze alot back then and when he would scratch with the little socks on he would 
just take the layers of skin with them. I finally just let him sleep without 
socks on and kept his nails cut as short as I possibly could. Now he has 
learned to scratch with the backs of his hands---they are really rough and 
dry... We still find blood in the sheets but not nearly as bad as when he was 
an infant.</p>
<p>I hope it is comforting to know that we are all out here with some of the 
same problems---it sure is for me. I have only been on this list for a couple 
of weeks and it makes me feel like I am not alone with such a challenging 
problem. I have never seen another child's skin that looks like Daniel's---we 
are always asked questions about his face in public. Anything from does he have 
the measles, chicken pox, what happened to him???</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 
18:17:10 From: Anil Subject: Gagging
<p>Was it only me sitting at the computer, sticking a pen down my throat? I 
have to say, I definitely DID gag. And I definitely have eczema. Those scaley 
red itchy areas are a bit of a giveaway that I have it, without any gag test! 
But I had fun trying it out.</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 10:35:29 From: Ann Subject: 
misc.
<p>Re: &quot;Beach Cure&quot;. So many possible factors: salt water is 
healing; sun is good too (as in UVA treatments); being on vacation usaully 
means time away from work stress and/or dusty house with pet dander; ocean air 
is generally pollen free; vacation clothes less irritating than work 
clothes...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re: scars from herpes infection. My mother used to tell me that some mark 
on my groin area was from the herpes infection, but now it is indistinguishable 
from other souvenirs. After 50 years of life and skin trouble, I have many 
permanent marks. Anyhow, the infant herpes infection did not leave any major 
scars on me. Rashes usually hide things like scars so when I notice one, I'm 
happy because it means my skin is doing well!</p>
<p>Linda, You may want to ask your doctor about Neosporin. Several doctors 
have told me to use polysporin instead. Something in Neosporin can cause 
allergic reactions. I hope your little boy is better today. I myself do more 
damage with fabric than with short smooth fingernails. I have no idea if it 
would be safe on a baby, but nail polish on the ends of the nails really makes 
mine far less lethal. I would be afraid that a baby might chew off the polish.
</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 13:45:55 From: Sue Subject: EPO, food allergies 
<p>We've been using evening primrose oil on Isaac (now 21 months) for almost a 
year. At first we gave him only about a teaspoon a day, and it had no effect. 
Then we found an M.D. who said to give him a lot more (like 5 tsps) per day. 
That seemed to help. It took about a month to show an improvement, but it 
really did seem to make a difference. And when we'd stop giving it to him, 
about two weeks later, he'd start to get worse.</p>
<p>Then we got word from a nutritionist that it might not be good to be giving 
him that much. After pushing her, she said that the essential fatty acids that 
she worries most about are not actually gamma-linolenic (in EPO), but the ones 
in fish oils--the Omega-3 essential fatty acids. We were giving Isaac a salmon 
gelcap that had 220 mgs of EPA and 180 mg of DHA (Omega-3s), and we stopped 
that.</p>
<p>So we still don't know whether the evening primrose oil, &quot;high 
doses&quot; (a tsp. or more a day) is a problem. Our pediatrician (who doesn't 
believe in this stuff, but had looked it up for another patient) says that it's 
not harmful.</p>
<p>If any of you DOES want to try evening primrose oil for a baby, you might 
want to look for NOW (brand) evening primrose oil in the 4 oz. bottles. It is a 
LOT cheaper than anything we've found in capsules, including borage oil 
(another source of GLA). We get it from our health food store here for about 
$14 for 4 ounces, which the bottle says is equivalent to 227 500mg softgels of 
EPA (I'm trusting them--haven't done the math). It's also alot easier than 
trying to get the oil out of the softgels, for babies who can't yet take pills.
</p>
<p>I also wanted to comment on the food allergy issue... for those of you who 
have kids who are &quot;allergic to everything,&quot; or for whom it seems that 
way. We had a lot of luck with a rotation diet. It's a pain, but the theory 
makes sense--you don't load the kid up with any particular food, and their 
bodies can tolerate the small, intermittent amounts. We did a four-day rotation 
for a long time--split all the foods into four different days, and them moved 
to a two-day. It's complicated because you have to arrange the foods by food 
GROUPS--ie, all &quot;nightshades&quot; on the same day (potatoes, peppers, 
etc), so it can get tough to figure out what goes on what day. There are books 
available to help figure out how to divide up the food groups, or I could let 
people know what we did, if anyone's interested. The biggest challenge is the 
grains--everything is related to wheat, and hence belongs on the same day. The 
exceptions are quinoa and amaranth (buckwheat, though unrelated, has some 
similar chemical properties, apparently). So we had a wheat-related day, a 
quinoa day, an amaranth day, and a day of no grains. The no-grain day included 
other nice carbos, but it was tough on quinoa and amaranth day--we did/do a lot 
of baking with those grains, and it's tricky... there's an allergy cookbook 
that has helped us--I think it's called &quot;The Food Allergy Cookbook&quot;.
</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 14:03:18 From: Robert Subject: Cyclosporine 
<p>Interesting that you have been taking prednisone at low dosage for 13 
years... do you think that it is doing anything for you after that length of 
time? I find that prednisone works for me less and less and sometimes I don't 
get the maximum relief until after I have been off it for a while. I would add 
my &quot;2 cents&quot; that maybe it is time to try something else... the first 
perhaps being taking nothing for a while, then if that doesn't get you 
somewhere, try the immuran. In my case, I can't use the immuran because I have 
a liver problem, but I wish that I could try it. I agree that habit and self 
control have little to do with scratching. When you itch, you scratch. You 
don't for the most part scratch first then itch later (although there is some 
of that when you leave the original area of itching).</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 
14:35:42 From: Royce Subject: to: Jolie&nbsp;
<p>Wow I feel like I could write a book about everything I experimented with 
to help my E. Unfortunately, I don't know that it would necessarily help 
anyone. Everyone seems to be different. One thing I wish for is a vaccine for 
E. - I really hope they come up with something soon. I will try to answer your 
questions as best as possible but understand that I am only relaying what I 
remember from my experiences &amp; from the information given to me from my 
doctors.</p>
<p>The following is a list of your good foods: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> most proteins incl. meat, poultry, most fish, tofu, eggs - I was very 
allergic to eggs at one time but now I can eat them like mad and feel fine 
-&nbsp;</li> 
<li> oils (most)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> small portions of beans&nbsp;</li> 
<li> almost all vegetables&nbsp;</li> 
<li> mayonnaise is okay for me&nbsp;</li> 
<li> sesame seeds&nbsp;</li> 
<li> small portions of rice, pasta &amp; potatoes. I try to eat mostly 
proteins with vegetables (without additives) &amp; I don't mix proteins with 
starches too often because I think it's harder to digest that way.</li> 
<li> also helpful to me is Vitamin E oil (5 drops) &amp; flax seed oil (1 tbs. 
per day in AM with about 1/2 cup of soy milk), Zinc (30 mg capsules) &amp; 
L-Lysine (1000mg) all taken with protein.</li> </ul> Supposed to be good but I 
don't use: burdock root, dandelion, B vitamins, vitamin C, Goldenseal, 
Echinecia, Yellow dock, Borage oil (I take flax seed instead).
<p>Also, I go to acupuncture 1 x per month. I think it helps regulate my cycle 
(I used to have a very irregular menstrual cycle &amp; bad PMS). It's weird but 
with me everything is connected; all stresses on my body effect the eczema. If 
something is off my eczema acts up. Even when I am constipated my eczema can 
flare (probably because the toxins are held in the body for too long (also 
related to leaky gut, I think).</p>
<p>Since you were interested in the &quot;good&quot; foods I figured the 
&quot;bad&quot; ones might be of interest too:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> yeast (bread products, wine, beer... )&nbsp;</li> 
<li> mold (some cheeses... )&nbsp;</li> 
<li> shellfish (I love it so I eat it &amp; suffer the consequences once in a 
while)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> most fruit -esp. citrus incl. tomato sauce &amp; ketchup&nbsp;</li> 
<li> fermented foods (incl. vinegar)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> nuts&nbsp;</li> 
<li> too much complex carbs (I eat very little sugar)&nbsp;</li> 
<li> too much starch (incl brown rice)</li> </ul> Other culprits for me (other 
than foods) are: most vitamins, lanolin, glycerin, propylene glycol, most 
acidophilus (this is a friendly bacteria which is supposed to be excellent for 
you esp. when taking antibiotics which kill this friendly bacteria which has a 
negative effect on the immune system so I wish I could find one that doesn't 
make my skin red- they say that when the skin gets red it's releasing the 
toxins but I'm not sure if I believe it). Also I'm highly allergic to pollen, 
dust, mold, cats (and most animals). Also, I get very itchy when I'm hot &amp; 
sometimes I perspire easily. When the eczema is bad and I exercise my skin 
burns.
<p>I believe that the overuse of cortisone creams all my life has caused some 
problems. I now have dark looking skin on my neck- the skin is normal &amp; 
smooth to the touch but has dark lines which looks like dirt or a weird suntan. 
I've tried various bleaching creams &amp; Retina A to get rid of it but those 
products only irritated my skin which makes the problem worse, if anything. So 
BEWARE of this side effect when using cort. creams. I think this discoloration 
may be called atrophy (not sure).</p>
<p>L-Glutamine is an amino acid that I've heard referred to as brain food. The 
holistic doctor said that taking enough of it (he recommended 4000mg per day) 
would build up the walls of the stomach so the toxins wouldn't leak out.</p>
<p>From what I understand, leaky gut is an increase in intestinal permeability 
which results in toxins, antigens etc. crossing the intestinal barrier which 
can cause many clinical conditions, one of which is food allergies. When I went 
to the holistic doctors they said that I had a high level of candida yeast in 
my system and thought this might be causing the eczema to flare. I spoke to my 
mom about it and she said that I was born with thrush. I was convinced that 
there was a connection at the time but can't be sure.</p>
<p>My eczema goes from bad to worse to clear depending on a million things. 
Right now I am pretty good but a couple of months ago I was covered head to toe 
and could barely sleep, work or do anything. Even the water from the shower 
burned. My doctor put me on prednisone which almost entirely cleared my skin 
within 2 days (problem: pred. kept me up all night). I had to wean off of it 
for a couple of weeks though and as I did the E. started coming back with a 
vengeance I was back where I started until I discovered that propylene glycol 
was one major culprit. I threw out all the products I had that contained this 
chemical and decided only to use my Theraplex moisturizers and zinc oxide 
ointment (a lot of the cortisone creams have this chemical in them too). When 
I'm red or itchy I do the &quot;evaporation&quot; thing which seems to help.</p>
<p>Have I tried homeopathy? Yes. I tried on my own with the little homeopathic 
medicinal pellets you put under the tongue a few times a day. The ones I tried 
are: sulphur, sepia, graphites, Apis Mellipica &amp; Thyrodium (the most 
effective for me). They seemed to help a bit but I don't use them anymore. It's 
hard to keep up with the various regimens.</p>
<p>DHEA, from what I understand, is a hormone regulator that everyone has some 
level of in their bodies. The pill form is available over the counter now but 
its effectiveness has not been proven. They say it can aid in weight loss, 
anti-aging process and a lot of other things. Since my level was low they 
thought that it may have had an effect on my hormones and adrenals.</p>
<p>I've tried various herbs but what I found is that I seem to be allergic or 
sensitive to many of them probably because I am allergic to plants and flowers.
</p>
<p>I never heard of MSM, what is that? I've used aloe vera topically and have 
found its soothing &amp; healing properties to be helpful. I keep some in the 
refrigerator: the coolness on my skin is nice sometimes. I've also drank the 
stuff but didn't see a noticeable difference. I think Evening Primrose used 
topically and taken orally is helpful after about 3 months. I used to take it 
religiously and I will probably start that again because I think it's helpful.
</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 18:17:28 From: Anil Subject: Sun/sea 
<p>In the past I've found that sun helps for about 2 days, then I get a really 
bad outbreak. But I tend not to like the sun much anyway, as I burn so easily.
</p>
<p>But the sea is great (after I've plucked up enough courage to go in there, 
with everyone looking at my legs like they're leprous). It always heals me up 
and calms down the E. By the time I've been in for a week, my legs look almost 
normal. I used to put on loads of moisturiser, but after a while I found it 
wasn't really necessary - I didn't dry out that much.</p>
<p>The other day in the supermarket I found a carton of 'Tidman's Sea Salt for 
Bathing'. It says on the box 'Helps improve skin conditions. An effective 
healing agent.' I've tried it twice, but I must say, the second time I had a 
very itchy night. I'll try it again though, as I'd also eaten more cheese than 
I should this last week. But for those like me who can't get to a beach 
regularly, this could be a substitute.</p> Date: 27 Feb 1997 15:00:36 From:

<p>Hi Linda, I have used the Alpha Keri Bath Oil all my life and love it!! I 
buy it in 16oz. bottles and put a small squeeze bottle of it and mineral oil 
half and half in the shower. When I turn the water off, I rub it on my skin 
then pat dry. I am one of the many people that react to the lanolin in baby oil 
but usually only on my face, it gets red and puffy. I like the Alpha Keri (I 
look for the generic brands of it) because it penetrates my tough skin and 
makes it soft. I only use the Vaseline at night before I go to bed because if 
it gets on you clothes, it's hard to get out. I use lotion when I shower in the 
morning before work but I still use the oils, I just don't get dressed right 
away (aren't you glad you're not in my house in the morning).</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that the EPO and Cod Liver Oil with the vitamins C and E 
are making the biggest difference. Someone at work yesterday said that my face 
was not swollen like normal.</p>
<p>Also, I am ready a pretty good book call &quot;Allergies... Disease in 
Disguise&quot; by Carolee Bateson-Koch DC ND published by Alive Books P.O. Box

<p>My 12 month old, Julia, was exactly like this (very bloody and oozy all 
over face) from 7 mos. old until about 11 mos. old. Rash then spread down neck 
and collar area on wrists and hands.</p>
<p>After talking with other moms on this list I took advice of severe diet 
changes. That was about the age that she had been eating more foods. So, I 
backed up to the pure basics again (Gerber applesauce, pears, rice cereal, 
squash, sweet potato..). And she nurses, so I changed my diet even more--no 
dairy, wheat, peanut butter, potatoes, or oatmeal. Very little beef or tuna 
(suspicious foods for us). That, in addition to going to a homeopath (she put 
her on a daily remedy to boost her immune system to oveercome these allergens 
on her own) and weekly visits to a chiropractor have made a big improvement! 
However, I'm going to start bathing her often and see if that helps too.</p>

<p>I took Cyclosporine because I too was going nowhere with steroids and 
couldn't get better. At the time, I would have done whatever the dr said. It 
was a godsend. I literally felt normal for the first time since I got eczema at 
13 yrs old. So why did I stop? I started getting migraines, which on the scale 
of things is worse than eczema and I wasn't sure that the Cyclosporine wasn't 
causing them.</p>
<p>Also, like you, I am wise enough to know that you cannot go around messing 
with heavy duty drugs without paying for it at some time down the road. I'm not 
quite ready to give up my future for a comfortable present. Also, it's an 
expensive habit. Each pill was $3 and I was taking 1-3 pills per day. Even with 
insurance, it adds up. Also, I had to take a blood test once a month to make 
sure that kidneys were ok. With all that said, I would rather go back to 
Cyclosporine and its potential side effects, than prednisone with its 
side-effects and no real relief...&nbsp;</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 10:49:17 From:

my baby's ear, foot, neck are always bloody in the morning. Things have been 
going a lot better nowaday as I started to learn more about it from you

Theory:Sun. Sweat purges infections
<p>Just a theory to add to the sun/ocean therapeutic affects we know about. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the germ killing affect of the sun and the affect the ocean 
water's contents must have on the skin, I theorize that the skin is purged by 
the profuse perspiration that occurs when we go in the sun. I think the flow of 
perspiration allows the pores to be purged and the skin cells to be cleansed by 
the moisture being forced from the inside of the body out through the skin. 
Perhaps this is why saunas are beneficial too.</p>
<p>But I should add. Finishing the sun bathing and/or sauna sessions with 
cool/cold showers water seems to make a big difference in the amount of benefit 
accomplised, infection reduced, and increased comfort level achieved. Doctors 
tell us that the cold shower closes the pores. I think there must be more to it 
than that.</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 17:37:11 From: Vicki Subject: Gagging

<p>Hi everyone- Here's an update since my Bad Night story yesterday. When I 
got home last evening, Brian looked so much better already. His face looked 
worse than it actually was from dried blood which was rubbed up and down his 
face. Once we washed his face (gently) a couple times throughout the day, he 
looked MUCH better -- just several scratches on his cheek. I'm so thankful it's 
healing so quickly! Once again, THANK YOU (all of you) for your kind words of 
concern and encouragement. You made it much easier to get through the day. ... 
and I'm always learning something from this group -- it's really great! Thanks 
for all the tips.</p>
<p>Oh, and the thing about the gag test is just hilarious! And reading some of 
the responses were just too funny -- I needed a good laugh! Have a great day 
everyone!</p>
<p>Tina, It sounds like you handled the situation well with the girl at 
preschool. Hopefully you'll be able to get his eczema under control so he 
doesn't have to deal with it when HE starts preschool. I agree that there are 
worse things... diseases, etc (much worse things). I try to remind myself (and 
husband) of that every day. Eczema is no fun, but otherwise our son is a 
beautiful, healthy little boy and so full of joy. He is such a blessing -- we 
thank God for him every day. Hope things get better for you (and your son).</p>
<p>Debbie (and Julia), I haven't really given Brian many baby foods yet. So 
far he's had rice cereal, bananas, green beans, corn (I think had a reaction), 
sweet potatoes, carrots, butternut squash (yuk!), and turkey (just tried this 
week). Once we have the allergy testing done, I think/hope it will be very 
helpful in controlling his eczema (especially on his face). He seems much 
better since I quit nursing (until his episode the other night). Around 10:00 
that evening he had rice cereal with bananas (and a bottle of formula, of 
course) -- I wonder if he's allergic to rice or bananas???</p> Date: 28 Feb

-Forwarded
<p>Our daughter 5 months old has had eczema since she was 3 months. My wife is 
pretty much a vegetarian, I have the family history of fair and tender skin. 
Our baby is 100% breastfed, born at home. She got the rash on her cheeks, and 
it also was on her forearms and calves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has made a number of herbal salves and we have talked to numerous 
homeopathic doctors and herbalists. There are good books on herbal care for 
children at most natural food coops. We have almost entirely organic cotton 
bedding and clothing, including diapers. Though now we have switched to Tushies 
and Seventh generation aloe vera wipes. A neigbor told us about bag balm, it 
turns out to have sulpha in it and caused our daughter to break out head to toe 
in hives... we were very scared and finally went to a pediatrician and were 
immediately given the full regimen- prednisolone, oral antibiotic and baby 
benadryl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our daughter hated the antibiotic and barely tolerated the liquid 
prednisone, but after five days it was all cleared up. She then rebounded and 
we found a dermatologist who turned us on to the Aquanil hc and Cetaphyl 
(though we dont like the lotion and now have doubts about the cleanser) and 
Vaseline... the vaseline alone seemed to do a lot of good, though my wife hates 
using a petroleum product. We were trying Aveeno for our daughter's flare ups, 
as a substitute for cortisone, and trying a vegetable based vaseline-like 
product for a moisture barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a real boost to see all the info from so many people on eczema. The 
Aveeno anti itch cream with calamine worked somewhat but the aveeno lotion 
caused her skin to get worse... we found a homeopathic cream that we are going 
to try. Pure Aloe Vera with the vegelatum ointment is working well on her legs. 
She found a vegetable vaseline substitute, and it works though it must be used 
more often. We are now avoiding ALL wool (including those expensive natural 
baby covers we got so many of) we bought some HEPA filters, and our dogs no 
longer come in the house. Things have stabilized, though my wife is still very 
interested in getting input from other homeopathic docs or people, and 
herbalists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a cortisone creme lotion when we have to (a couple of times a week). 
Our baby is 100% breastfed, and we are really (that is my wife... ) working on 
her diet. Simple, steamed basmati rice and vegetables carrots, asparagus and 
broccoli, we have recently introduced chicken. She is avoiding soy, dairy, 
sweets including fruits and juices, she drinks rice milk, has a rice/oat/barley 
cereal mix in the am. We eat pretty much all organic foods, and did for a year 
before conception, along with no drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>This stuff must be genetic, though we do see correlations between what my 
wife eats and our daughter's skin condition. We were initially bathing her in 
warm water no soap every day, but that just aggravated things. Now we are been 
bathing her every other day with Cetaphil, no baths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have started a course of homeopathic treatment so we'll see how that 
works in about two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has been doing the baby clothes in the laundry by doing a natural 
detergent at one quarter strength then a vinegar rinse followed by a baking 
soda rinse. We are using a spray on her scalp, Na-PCA non oily with aloe vera, 
from the local coop made by Twin Lab in NY. Other natural products that are 
working, Simicort a cream herb product substitute for cortisone, made by 
Enzymatic Therapy in Green Bay Wisconsin 54311 800-783-2286 also natural baby 
body lotion from Aubrey organics 1-800-aubreyh. Both of these products have 
some fragrance, but they are working on our daughter.</p>
<p>From what I've read so far, it does seem that one person's cure is 
another's nightmare, such as lanolin. By word of mouth we have heard of things 
that have worked for some people... be forwarned... some say bag balm, it 
contains sulpha and lanolin, some say curel, or eucerine, or cetaphyl. Names 
most of you are probably familiar with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thought... test your water, chlorine, bromine and possible metals 
can be an irritant. We are very interested in successes with various natural 
products. One good tip from my own experience-I had very bad hay fever from 
puberty till age 31 when I gave up caffein and refined sugar completely (no 
pepsi or iced tea either) and started eating organic and only rarely red meat. 
I love fish and seafood... But since that time I have had no hay fever or 
significant allergies, and I used to have pills and steroid inhaler-the 
works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good wishes to all, and I believe that copious amounts of love for our 
afflicted ones and their caregivers really does help and really does 
matter.&nbsp;</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 10:46:02 From: Alex Subject: Theory:Sun.

<p>This sounds like a good theory, but there must be something more to it than 
this, because if I work up a good sweat during indoor exercise, my skin flares 
up afterwards. This also happens after outdoor exercise in the summer (in the 
sun) I haven't been on a beach vacation for several years, but when I was a 
kid, swimming in the ocean every day would clear up my hands every time, so I 
think the ocean has a lot to do with it. I was just thinking, you can get ocean 
salt at the pet shop to make salt water for marine fish tanks. Maybe I'll get 
some of that to make ocean water to soak my hands in. I'll let you know if it 
works.</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 12:07:09 From: Royce Subject: allergies &amp; E 
<p>Hi. One thing that I noticed throughout the years, that makes E/allergies 
even more annoying, is that my allergies to things change from time to time. At 
one time I was allergic to eggs; now they don't bother me at all. I used to 
have a dog; now I can't even enter a home that has one without having a full 
blown reaction. Nuts used to be okay; now if I eat them I wake up with a red 
face in the morning. Various moisturizers, creams, chemicals, vitamins etc. 
were okay but now I notice I am sensitive to many products I had used for years 
(one ex: I used Eucerin for a long time until one day it started to make my 
skin worse. The cortisone creams, I believe, everyone has to switch around 
because you can build up a tolerance to them.</p>
<p>Does anyone else notice this? It's so hard to keep track of what to and not 
to stay away from. You think you figured it out until the next allergy attack 
and then the detective work starts all over again...&nbsp;</p> Date: 28 Feb

<p>I too notice great results when I'm in the sun (esp. at the beach when I go

soaking in a tub with Dead Sea Salts and some type of oil or aveno oatmeal 
product (I know aveno doesn't agree with everyone but the gentle bath/shower 
cleanser, which I use everyday in place of regular soap &amp; the oatmeal work 
for me.)</p>

something)?</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 10:17:32 From: Ann Subject: gentle sunscreens 
<p>Royce, I have had good luck for years with Shade UVAGuard. It's only a 15 
SPF (burn protective) so it wouldn't be good for all day on the beach. But it 
contains the best aging protective (according to my derm dr.) so it's good for 
everyday- around-town use. It's fragrance free and has a nice greasy feel. It 
does contain a lot of strange sounding chemicals - so beware! When I'm 
concerned about burning (like on the beach or skiing or watersliding), I use 
Coppertone Water Babies UVA/UVB Sunblock Lotion SPF 45. It is scented and full 
of those strange chemicals. I have never used it day after day, but it seems OK 
for me to use occasionally.</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 14:38:15 From: Melissa 
Subject: Desowen lotion
<p>I am fairly new to this eczema thing. My daughter, now 16 months old, had 
her first bad &quot;flare up&quot; when she was 11 months old. What started out 
as dry, flaky patches concentrated on her legs and face had turned into bright 
red, swollen, oozy welts on 75% of her body. She was absolutely miserable. I 
took her to our family doctor who diagnosed her with eczema and told us to 
apply lubriderm lotion and benedryl for the itchiness. When that didn't help 
much I took her to a derm. who again diagnosed Hannah with atopic dermitis. He 
prescribed Desowen lotion .05%. Desowen is a low-potency, Group VI topical 
corticosteroid lotion. The active ingredient is desonide.</p>
<p>I feel hesitant to give my baby steroids (although they have made a 
significant improvement in her skin). When I asked the derm. about any side 
effects he kind of blew me off (as if I dared to question him). Any way, I 
wanted to get some feedback from the group. Has anyone ever heard of Desowen? 
Do any of the other moms and dads out there give their small children similar 
medicines?</p>
<p>Also, does time of year seem to have any effect on the disease? It seemed 
Hannah definately got worse towards autumn (when it first starts to get cool 
here, although we have had a very mild winter). Does this mean we can look 
forward to spring? Is this wishful thinking?</p> Date: 28 Feb 1997 13:44:10

said, I don't use them but every couple of weeks and I was told never to put it 
on his face.</p>
<p>Our allergist said winter is harsher because it is so cold and dry here. 
Daniel did look alot more clear last summer. I would let him be in direct sun 
for 5 to 10 minutes then go play in the shade. His legs and arms were still

creams, cortisones, in the morning and night. Like you said though, it is hard 
to keep track of it all. As I am writing this, I was absent mindedly scratching

<p>My eczema seems to get worse in the spring. But I have seasonal allergies

Date: 28 Feb 1997 21:31:21 From: Melley Subject: exercise, sweating, zinc, 
allergies, etc.
<p>Exercise used to give me terrible hives, redness, and itching. I did it 
anyway. Now my sweat makes me itch and burn, but probably only because my skin 
is broken. I try to avoid sweating if possible: swimming, running at night or 
on a treadmill in front of a fan, bike riding in skimpy clothing. It seems like 
the eczema is always worse under my jog bra.</p>
<p>I just ordered the zinc stuff. I hope it works. I'm in the middle of a bad 
outbreak, my antihistamines have mysteriously stopped working (second type that 
this has happened with), and I need a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>It seems like I will eventually become allergic to everything if I use it 
long enough, including everything the doctor prescribes about halfway through 
the tube. I haven't noticed any food allergies, but I am keeping a food diary, 
which I just started recently. I once read the results of a study that said 
that 60% of ALL conditions cleared up on their own when a daily journal was 
kept. I also just started L-lysine, and would be interested to hear of any 
side-effects anyone may have noticed. I would also like to hear about the 
results of UVA. I used that several times in the past very successfully for 
psoriasis, which was my bad skin problem growing up. It has now been replaced

Subject: bathing kids
<p>I'm the parent of a 22 year old young woman with severe food allergies and 
eczema. My experience has been that anything &quot;strong&quot; was too strong. 
That was my first impulse when I read your first post about using Head and 
Shoulders. Your last note suggests that it is causing some problems.</p>
<p>Eucerin has lanolin, doesn't it? Both my daughters react to lanolin. 
Cetaphil, however, was recommemded amd seemed ok. The ingredient in Desitin is 
the zinc oxide... might try a more pure form? OR the zinc formulation some 
others on this list have suggested... just a thought.</p>
<p>I found out when Bonnie was 3 months old that she was suffering from 
allergic eczema. Up til then I'd been told that she was just &quot;a cranky 
baby&quot; and that she had a bad &quot;heat rash&quot;. I weaned her on Drs 
advice and put her on a soy formula. She seemed to undergo a transformation... 
clear, beautiful skin, and she became a truly joyful child.</p>
<p>This changed when she started solid foods. Eventually I had to think of a 
million ways to cook lamb, carrots, rice, and bananas. These were the only 
things she could tolerate. Even then, these had to be rotated.</p>
<p>Things that helped her included Balnetar (a tar bath that soothed her skin) 
and Aveeno colloidal oatmeal bath. The only soap she could use was glycerin, 
clear, unscented. Of course the steroid ointments helped immensely as did the 
antihistimines. (However, I now believe that these are as much a curse as a 
blessing.)</p>
<p>During Bonnie's teens the reactions slowed down, and she seemed to have 
&quot;outgrown&quot; most of her problems. Recently, however, she has had a 
relapse of major proportions. She has had so many injections of cortisteroids 
that Drs now tell her she has probably done considerable damage to some vital 
systems. The list of pollens, molds, foods, danders, etc. to which she has 
tested as severely allergic is mind-bending.</p>
<p>9 years after Bonnie was born, I had Katie and immediately recognized her 
problem. Although both my midwives and her pediatrician assured me that she 
just had &quot;heat rash&quot;, I knew she was displaying eczema and allergic 
reactions. I first tested this hypothesis by taking all milk, corn, and wheat 
out of my own diet for two weeks. Then, I simply gorged on ice-cream, milk, and 
cheese. During my &quot;fasting&quot; phase, her skin cleared up 100%. Just 
hours after my milk diet began, she again displayed serious skin disruptions. I 
then eliminated all milk products from my diet, as well as anything that seemed 
to affect Katie. Of course I monitored my diet carefully and watched Katie for 
any reaction.</p>
<p>In this way I was able to keep nursing her. She stayed clear most of the 
time, and except for one incident of an asthma-like reaction after exposure to 
dust (from a herd of goats), she has had few allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Today, Katie does break out in hives or itchy rashes when she is exposed to 
animal dander, but has very few of the problems that Bonnie has had to live 
with for most of her life. There are foods Katie avoids because they &quot;make 
her tongue tingle&quot; but no severe reactions have surfaced. I really 
attribute this to noticing her skin condition on the day she was born, 
recognizing the similarity and ACTING ON IT, in spite of the well-meaning 
advice of my care-givers.</p>
<p>Bonnie still finds Balnetar to be comforting (despite its awful smell) 
though the oatmeal now causes some problems for her. Vaseline and mineral oil 
are almost the only thing she can put on her skin to protect it.</p>
<p>I just include this history to let you know some of the things I noticed 
with my two children, and a couple of strategies that worked for us. We have no 
solutions for Bonnie right now. She is trying to learn all she can about her 
condition, which is one reason that I joined this list.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to all of you who have shared here. From watching my 
babies suffer with the agonies of the infernal itching I have a glimpse of what 
sufferers undergo. From many nights trying to lull Bonnie into a state of deep 
relaxation, and teaching her to use positive imagery to overcome her impulse to 
scratch, I have a real sense of the helplessness and fear parents of children 
with eczema undergo. I wish I'd have had this sort of connection to others back 
then. I just remember feeling so alone... Bless you all... hope some of what 
I've shared is helpful in some little way.</p>
