<h2>Dogs That Changed the World<br>
Introduction</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>NATURE&rsquo;s two-part special <em>Dogs That Changed the World</em> tells 
the epic story of the wolf&rsquo;s evolution, how &ldquo;man&rsquo;s best 
friend&rdquo; changed human society and how we in turn have radically 
transformed dogs.</p> 
<p>From the tiniest Chihuahua to the powerful and massive English Mastiff, 
modern domesticated dogs come in a bewildering array of shapes and sizes, with 
an equally diverse range of temperaments and behaviors. And yet, according to 
genetics, all dogs evolved from the savage and wild wolf &mdash; in a 
transformation that occurred just 15,000 years ago.</p> 
<p>In Part One, &ldquo;The Rise of the Dog,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll learn about 
how the domestication of dogs might have taken place, including the theory of 
biologist Raymond Coppinger that it was the animals themselves &mdash; and 
human trash &mdash; that inspired the transformation. The genetic analysis of 
Peter Savolainen of the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden has placed the 
origins of domesticated dogs &mdash; and those of the first dog &mdash; in East 
Asia. You&rsquo;ll also discover 14 dog breeds that controversial genetic 
studies show are the most ancient &mdash; and the best living representatives 
of the ancestors to all living dogs.</p> 
<p><strong>Preview Part Two: Dogs by Design</strong></p> Get the Flash Player 
to see the wordTube Media Player.<br>

<p>Over 400 breeds of dog are recognized around the world, each unique for its 
personality, habits, and form. Most of these breeds exploded onto the scene 
over the past 150 years, spurred by the Victorian-era passion for the 
&ldquo;dog fancy&rdquo; &mdash; the selective breeding of dogs to enhance 
particular characteristics. By tinkering with its genetics, humans made the dog 
the most varied animal species on the planet &mdash; and also created a host of 
hereditary health problems.</p> 
<p>Despite the plethora of new shapes and sizes, dogs have retained the 
instincts bred into their ancestors by thousands of years of work: the urge to 
herd or hunt, to dig and to guard. In Part Two, &ldquo;Dogs by Design,&rdquo; 
you&rsquo;ll discover how these hard-wired behaviors help different types of 
dogs, from hounds to herders, excel at different tasks (and why it can 
sometimes be so difficult to train them to do otherwise). You&rsquo;ll also 
learn how dogs&rsquo; finely tuned senses are serving humans and saving lives.

<p>I think that the dogs here were very clever on how they changed the world. 
Us humans would have never made it through the world without them. I work at 
the humane society in illinois. I love dogs, cats, rats, mice, bunnies, 
hamsters, guinea pigs, and pretty much all animals that walk the earth. So i 
wish i could contain a special and secret cabin for them so they would live 
healthy, and happy forever. :-)</p>

<p>I find it amazing how this breed changed some people like the blind or can 
go to the hospital and make people happy and when you are sad they will be 
there for you I find it right that they have earned the name &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s 
best friend&rdquo; beacuse thats what they are.We should think of not 
torchoring our dogs like we do at the rate we do now so do me a fav and make 
your dogs happy and that will give them a little smile on the inside.<br>

<p>Dogs are fantastic and very lovable, so much so that many humans obsessed 
with dogs would come to the rescue of a dog before they would come to the 
rescue of another human. Don&rsquo;t lose site of the humanity, afterall, Its 
why we have such a relationship with these animals in the first place.</p> </li>

<p>The show may be very informative, but I disagree with the phrase &ldquo;all 
dogs evolved from the savage and wild wolf&rdquo;. I thought we had progressed 
past the stereotype of the &ldquo;big, bad wolf.&rdquo; Sure, wolves are not 
tame and gentle with people, but they are extremely gentle with their pack and 
show all the finest character traits of modern dogs. They are loyal and 
nurturing, and have a complex social structure. The negative use of words like 
&ldquo;savage&rdquo; are the reason that some people believe they should be 
killed and exterminated. Scientific studies and anecdotal observation has shown 
that they are not savages. There is so much about wolves that is admirable from 
a human point of view, and they are magnificent animals who deserve our respect 
and protection.</p> </li>

<p>I my opinion anyone can deny the importance of dogs in our life,for 
different reasons:<br>
 First of all,dog is like humain being a god creature.
<br> In this way they have the same right like us to survie.<br>
 secondly,they 
are very useful for us when they are previously tamed.thus they can be our 
guide, our protector against murder, and also sense.<br>
 for example,bind 
peoples use dogs to direct them.police men use also dog to investigate or 
looking for a drug among gang in USA neiberhood.<br>
 in short dog are the 
complement of humain being.</p> </li>

submitting. The level of literacy evident throughout the responses to this 
fabulous and informative program is lamentable. Let&rsquo;s try to educate 
ourselves enough to leave our opinion in a dignified and accurate manner.</p>

<p>Hey Elsa,<br>
 Why don&rsquo;t you LAY OFF! Many of the comments written 
here are by CHILDREN. We should be thankful they are interested in educational 
programing. So why don&rsquo;t you quit insulting a bunch of KIDS! They ARE 
trying to get an education, but, unfortunately, the educational system is one 
of the numerous problems in this country today. Until we&rsquo;ve made great 
strides to remedy the deplorable state of our schools, please quit scolding 
children for their poor grammar and spelling and look for a more positive way 
that you can impact the situation.</p> </li> 
<li> Elsa says: <br>
September 28, 2008 at 10:14 pm <br>

<p>Maybe &lsquo;Englishteacher&rsquo; needs to do a bit more work? A bit more 
impact? As an &lsquo;Englishteacher&rsquo; myself, I can tall you that I 
wouldn&rsquo;t praise my kids for mediocre or subpar performance. I would take 
this as an an opportunity for learning and advancement. In fact, I guide them 
toward excellence. But, that&rsquo;s actually beyond the point &ndash; you know 
as well as I do that people posting here are adults. Kids are on Facebook, not 
on PBS.</p> </li> 
<li> Elsa says: <br>
September 28, 2008 at 10:16 pm <br>

<p>Yes, I realize I misspelled a couple of words:) Edit function would be nice 
&ndash; as English teachers, we know writing is a process, not a product, 
right:)</p> </li>

<p>Thanks Elsa. Where did these people go to school? And did they pay 
attention? If they are children, turn off the TV and learn to spell better. If 
they are adults, take a night class. I think I saw one of the 
&ldquo;children&rdquo; was a 6th grader. I knew how to spell at that age. So, 
I&rsquo;m in agreement with Elsa. Please proofread, or get an adult who does 
know how to spell, to help you. The program was great. I can&rsquo;t wait for 
part 2.</p> </li>

<p>Great program. I breed Rhodesian Ridgebacks occassionally and have 
discussed the make up of behaviour and personality many times with potential 
puppy owners. In those talks, the research with the black fox has been an 
example i hve used to explain genetic/breeding selection for temperment.<br>
 
Thank you for educating the public. All breeds have been created with certain 
charateristics &ldquo;hard wired&rdquo; into their behaviour pattern.<br>
 So 
as a dog owner,<br>
 Please do not expect your Border Collie to lie quietly at 
your feet!! Or your Jack Russel not to dig holes in the garden.<br>
 It is 
their nature. Add a dog to the family with the<br>
 understanding of the type 
of lifestyle each breed requires, and if it does not fit with your lifestyle,
<br> Do Not get a dog!</p> </li>

<p>One of the biggest problems today with dog owners is they go out and obtain 
dogs that gain popularity by their presence in a movie or commercial. These 
dogs unfortunately end up in shelters because the owners didn&rsquo;t do their 
homework and research the dogs intended use. It&rsquo;s so important to know 
what the dog was bred to do before making the decision to own it. We&rsquo;ve 
become a society that believes anything is disposable if it becomes a burden to 
our own lifestyle. PBS thanks for the excellent programs!!!!!</p> </li>

<p>For those of you with the unnecessarily harsh comments, this world really 
isn&rsquo;t in need of more critics&hellip;..we have enough. How about posting 
a comment that aims to help out a bit as oppose to a slamming others from 
different circumstances and with varying abilities? To imply that everyone 
should be proofreading their contributions is ridiculous! This is an informal 
blog. A number of kids do actually enjoy PBS and have posted comments. Get off 
your high horse and give us a break! While our educational system and values 
are worthy of attention, one benefits from being humble! Your tone is 
reminiscent of someone who gets kicks out of putting other people 
down&hellip;&hellip;not what I expected at this site.</p> </li>

<p>Agree with the comments about the positivity in making potential dog owners

dog whose genetic propensities would make them an unsuitable fit for my

<p>I just watched this. It&rsquo;s very true,If dogs were never born in the 
world man kind would be lost forever. We need these dogs, If they were never 
created what would be sledding? What about people who can&rsquo;t see? 
Everything! We need these dogs.<br>
 And that Why there here. have you seen 
people from back? they thought dogs were why people lived. They have special 
powers. They have powers to help the world. We need dogs.<br>
 Have you ever 
seen a dog hater? There are many, If you have they just have never been loved. 
They need a friend.</p>

2;ithink it&rsquo;s very interresting to learn of the history of them,and the 
reasons for their selective breeding processes,why we would breed combinations 
to suite certain needs,need being the mother of invention,how dare we fool with 
natuers plan vs. our fancies,yet look at the multitude &amp; diversity of our 
acheivments .it truely is amazing!!look forward to more such viewing thank

<p>Mrs. Koplow,<br>
 i can understand your feelings about the use of the word 
savage, as you are completely correct about the consequences if that is the 
intent of the word to use it for the negative connotations carried with the 
word savage. However, please allow me to suggest something that I feel is more 
likely.</p> 
<p> You are interpreting that they are using savage with the definition of 
something unthinkingly violent and simply cruel. This is a valid interpretation 
and one extremely close to the one I am about to suggest. What I would like to 
put to your consideration is that they are not saying the wolf in general is a 
savage beast. Instead that perhaps it is that the wolf when it hunts can be 
savage. I have watched them hunt in the wild before. I was at a safe and 
respectful distance of course; and savage would definantly apply to the course 
of action they took.</p> 
<p> I do not produce the show, but I have had the privilege of viewing 
(multiple times) Nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;Valley of the Wolves&rdquo; episode and 
do not believe they would ever intentionally mean to demean or slander wolves.
</p> 
<p> Now, truth be told I have not had the oppurtunity to thoroughly look over 
this article. At first glance, and if it holds true to the quality Nature has 
brought thus far it will be very enjoyable. But as I have not gone through it 
thoroughly, I cannot know the entire context of the quote in question. All I am 
saying is please consider it in full context; and that they are not saying 
savagery defines the wolf entirely; merely, that it is a part of the wolf the 
same as every carnivore has a bit of savagery in it.</p> </li>

<p>Ray Coppinger has one of the greatest understandings of canine development. 
Tamar Gellar has also studied the complex relationship of dog vs. wolf. Even my 
own bichon frise still remains a small bit of her wolf spirit. I enjoyed the 
program and look forward to the second half.</p> </li>

<p>They ask you ( Muhammed S.A.W ) as to what is allowed to them. Say: The 
good things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts and birds 
of prey, training them to hunt&ndash; you teach them of what Allah has taught 
you&ndash; so eat of that which they catch for you and mention the name of 
Allah over it; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is swift in 
reckoning.</p> </li>

<p>The possibility that instead of humans domesticating dogs, that dogs (or 
wolves) were domesticating us is fascinating.</p> 
<p>Perhaps a similar thesis should be explored with milk-giving animals like 
cattle, (water) buffalo, goats and even sheep. Giving milk is not an 
involuntary act, but an expression of love. Perhaps domestication happened 
because these animals had the capacity to love humans and see them as surrogate 
young in need of being fed was central to the process and no less (or more) 
planned out than on the human side. This may be difficult to see in the U.S. 
where cows are kept under factory-like, highly rationalized arrangements, but 
it becomes clearer with subsistence farmers that keep a &ldquo;family 
cow&rdquo; that is can be seen to be bound to the family by affection as well 
as practical considerations. Perhaps it was as profound an intellectual 
breakthrough for these animals to generalize the notion of creatures needing 
nurturance from their own species to humans as it was for humans to understand 
in a cultural sense that their fellow creatures could be useful in other 
capacities besides sources of meat.</p> </li>

<p>Part I of this series was fascinating to both me and my labrador puppy. I 
watched the whole thing. She watched mostly whenever there was a dog noise 
coming from the T.V. Sorry we missed part II. I wonder if anyone has thought of 
breeding a dog from wolves which would be similar to the early dog breeds?</p>

<p>this show was great. It shaowed how they breeaded diffrent dogs together to 
get the on that they wanted. for example how if they wanted a small dog with 
long hair then they would breead a chiwawa with a shitzu and it would be a 
small dog with long hait. or the pitbull they would take a small stubby dog and 
bread it with ont that has a muscular body and it would come out to that. the 
one part that i dinit like about that was in the how dogs changed the world 
part 2, was how the small chinese dogs were sloughtered but the soldiers who 
destroyed the princesses home in the twain dinasty but at lest a few of these 
beautiful dogs were saved and now the breead is back to where it is suppost to 
in a protected aer where no body will beable to kill them. that is the ony part 
i dinit like. but the show was awsome. a big thumbs up.</p> </li>

bloodhounds and to be quite honest i do not know what i would do without 
them&hellip;.they are so important to me and my family that i do not think 
anyone who hurts them can be stable. All animals keep the world going 
around&hellip;.and we shouldnt forget&hellip;.we are animals just like dogs. We 
all evolved from a speck of bacteria, which I beleive that god made happen, 
therefore we should place ourselves any higher up than the rest of the animal 
kingdom.</p> 
<p>I also think everyone should realise is that thisa page is not for

<p>I feel so sorry for dogs, in that humans never have<br>
 respected them 
enough to keep them as they were,but<br>
 wanted to change them to their 
suitability. How ugly<br>
 of the human. Most humans are not nice. The most<br>

 beautiful dog in the world is the wolf, and he is not<br>
 pulled around by 
his neck, or nuzzle locked, or<br>
 chained or put in a cage for hours while 
humans at<br>
 work, GOD LOVE THE DOG AND SHAME AND DISGRACE ON THE<br>
 
HORRIBLE HUMAN. Humans modified dogs to their want<br>
 and with this came a 
number of terrible health<br>
 problems, but do the humans care how the dog 
suffers -<br>
 NO. UGLY, HORRIBLE, SICKENING, STUPID, HUMANS..WHERE<br>
 THE 
HELL ARE THEIR BRAINS&hellip; IN THEIR FEET.</p> </li>

<p>Dogs are beautiful. So are all animals, no matter how they look on the 
outside. Who cares about what&rsquo;s on the outside? People may say that you 
are ugly, but does it matter to you? Just for feelings, maybe. But you 
eventually get over it. As the same with dogs. They will always love you, for 
rich or for poor, for better or worse, in sickne&hellip;.. WAIT! YOU&rsquo;RE

<p>I love dogs and have had one or more most of my adult life. Now have a cute 
Pom/Chi mix from a shelter that is loving, fun, and a non-lethal 
watchdog(barks, but kisses). I have a beef about people (1) breeding dogs with 
genetic problems including those with too large heads (births require 
C-sections), extremely flattened faces(difficulty breathing), etc., and (2) 
tail and ear cropping to suit show standards (dewclaws are another matter as 
removing them after birth can prevent later injury). In general, dogs should be 
left in their natural state. Also, I think those poodle show cuts are just 
ridiculous- what&rsquo;s wrong with a simple puppy/kennel cut? I think the AKC 
and other kennel clubs ought to completely revise their breed and show 
standards for the good of the dogs.</p> </li>

<p>If the Russian experiments shows that breeding for tameness results in dogs 
in 10 years of selective breeding, why is that all domestic dogs have come from 
wolves and none have come from foxes?. If those wolves with smaller flight 
distance evolved into dogs, why didn&rsquo;t those foxes with smaller distances 
also evolve into dogs as the Russian experiment suggests?</p> 
<p>Also, has anyone tried to repeat the Russian fox experiment, but use wolves 
instead to prove the theory that wolves with shorter flight distance (tamer 
wolves) evolved into dogs? Until this is done, it seems the conclusion that 
wolf evolution proceeded the same way as the fox experiment suggests is overly 
speculative.</p> </li>

elsewhere on the web. I LOVED those little guys. The ones in the show were 
mostly black, and it was during the segment that also discussed how melatonin 
is linked to the tame disposition, etc. Anyone know what that dog-fox breed is 
called?</p> </li>

<p>Some good books that I have found on wolves and dogs include: The Wolf by 
Francesco Cesoni and Giovani Fassoli; The Encylopedia of the Dog &ndash; The 
Definitive Visual Guide by Dr. Bruce Fogle; and The Original Dog Bible &ndash; 
The Definitive Source For All things Dog edited by Kristin Mehus Roe (BowTie 
Press). Each has some explanation of the evolution of wolves. I like the 
Encyclopedia of the Dog best for this purpose, plus, for those of you wanting 
to know what a certain breed was that you saw in the program this book and The 
Dog Bible are great sources. For those wolf lovers, The Wolf has beautiful 
pictures and good information, including the efforts regarding the preservation 
of wolves. Can you tell I&rsquo;m a wolf and dog lover?</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Sancisco&rdquo; part 2 will air 9/19/2010. Time, 7:00 or 8:00, 
depending on where you live. In the preview they talk about certain breeds 
being in danger (probably from inbreeding to get the desired look) and they 
show a Pekingese. That makes me sad because I got a Peke who was rescued from a 
puppy mill and I adore her. I was always more of a cat person but from now on 
I&rsquo;m a toy dog breed all the way. Would love a large dog but in a one 
bedroom apartment that would be cruel. Anyway, I can&rsquo;t wait to get home 
each day to my sweet Peke. She makes me feel so good when that tail wags and 
she &ldquo;talks&rdquo; (not barking) to me. She isn&rsquo;t the lap dog I 
hoped for, I guess she still has trust issues from being in the puppy mill for 
about 6 years, but I still love her like crazy. Puppy mill owners should rot in 
jail forever!<br>

<p>Wow, either things must really be slow at Nature or it&rsquo;s an awful 
sign of how degraded our natural world has truly become if they&rsquo;re doing 
TWO shows in a row about DOGS for Gosh Sakes! If I want to see dogs, I can just 
take a stroll around the block. Your series is supposed to be about WILD 
animals and/or WILD places, Nature! And keep humans to a minimum if you can too.

watching an episode about flies or sparrows or chickens. Deadly dull.</p> </li>

<p>As a professional dog trainer and behaviorists, I thought this was a great 
program. I wish they would have spent a little time on puppy mills. I would 
love to see more shows on this dispicable practice since this is still such a 
huge problem in the U.S and Canada.<br>
 Anyway, getting back on the topic, I 
have been a student of the dog for many years and was surprised to learn some 
things I have not heard of before. Interesting program. A little suprised by 
some of the negative comments such as &ldquo;dogs are ugly&rdquo; and &ldquo;I 
hate dogs&rdquo;. If this is the case then why did you watch the show?</p>

<p>Pit bulls are a fighting dog and are pecieved as such in the public eye. 
They are known to be vicious and most that purchase them dont realise there 
personality or temperament is this.. They are tough cookies. ^ As said above 
its all in the way that they are raised by the owners. Treated with respect and 
love the dog will show the same back but treated in the way that is bad or 
poorly does not bode well for the dog. Vicious dog symdrome.</p> 
<p>Pet the dog love the dog, but do not abuse and provoke the dog because ive 
seen on take its owners fingers off because he goaded the dog constantly. 
Admitedely his own fault and he has changed his ways.. Its certainly the fact 
that these dogs are animals and are such unpredicatable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to look for this on Netflix, it sounds really interesting. 
I did a DNA test on my dog and the main result that came up was Chow Chow. My 
vet said that it&rsquo;s really common for that to happen &ndash; because 
it&rsquo;s one of the 14 ancient breeds, most mixed-breed dogs will show the 
genetic traits of those breeds.</p> 
<p>Fascinating stuff, thanks for sharing.</p> </li>

<p>I was always more of a cat person but from now on I&rsquo;m a toy dog breed 
all the way. Would love a large dog but in a one bedroom apartment that would 
be cruel. Anyway, I can&rsquo;t wait to get home each day to my sweet Peke.</p>

<p>I loved this episode about dogs, especially the segment about the silver 
foxes. I hate that wolves are depicted as savages. I had the joy of having a 70 
% wolf-malmut-border collie-white shepard. The dog portions of his lineage were 
far removed&hellip;into the great grandparents. I have had the pleasure of many 
types of dogs in my family, but I must say NEVER have I seen a sweeter, more 
intelligent, gentle animal in my life. Sabre is greatly missed by our entire 
family and everyone that he came into contact with were amazed by him. He was 
house trained in two days. I must say that a wolf hybrid is not an animal that 
you put in the backyard and occasional play with. He was a very integrated part 
of our family and his feeling were very easily hurt with just a curt word. 
Wolf/Hybrids make terrible pets.but amazing companions. We never forgot that he 
was a wolf. I think that is the problem with most pit owners. They forget the 
potential for damage that these dogs can do. Sabre only thought of playing. I 
believe that I would be very disappointed in another breed after experiencing 
the love and intelligence of our friend Sabre. One last word. Evolution does 
not discount christianity. We are evolving every day, and continue to do so.</p>

details make or break the argument.. And that could not be more true right 
here. Having said that, allow me tell you exactly what did give good results. 
Your text is certainly very powerful and this is possibly why I am making the 
effort to comment. I do not really make it a regular habit of doing that. 
Secondly, despite the fact that I can notice a leaps in reasoning you come up
