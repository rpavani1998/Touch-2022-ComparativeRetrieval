<h3>From &#147;The Men They Will Become&quot;<br>
 Eli H. Newberger, M.D.</h3> 
<p><strong>Chapter 20 - <i> PLAY AND SPORTS</i></strong></p> 
<p>On a Saturday afternoon a few months ago, a visiting junior league football 
team of middle-school-age boys dealt a loss to a team from a suburb not more 
than twenty miles from where I live. The score was not close. The home team was 
winless for the season, which didn't improve the mood of the parents and other 
locals who had gathered to watch and to cheer if the game gave them any 
opportunity.</p> 
<p>It seemed to the hometown crowd that the officiating was faulty. The head 
coach for the home team was ejected from the game for challenging a referee's 
decision. The local announcer broadcast obscenities directed at the officials 
over the public address system during the game, for which behavior he was 
barred from the announcer's booth for the remainder of the season.</p> 
<p>In the parking lot after the game, there was a noisy confrontation between 
the teams and their followers. Bottles were thrown by the hometown crowd toward 
the visitors. Eventually, parents of the visiting team charged, the assistant 
coach of the home team deliberately accelerated his car toward a 
thirteen-year-old visiting player, forcing him to jump quickly aside to escape 
being hit. The local chief of police described the altercation as 
&quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;inappropriate,&quot; but he also felt that the 
news media blew it out of proportion.</p> 
<p> As we shall see, deciding what constitutes judicious proportion is not a 
simple matter where sports are concerned. But it isn't hard to find examples of 
the injudicious. Richard Lapchick of Northeastern University has told of going 
to see his twelve-year-old son's first hockey game. The son's team lost by one 
goal. After the game another of the fathers came into the locker room, yanked 
his son up off the bench where he was sitting, and yelled: &quot;You fucking 
son of a bitch; if you'd hit that guy against the wall you wouldn't have lost 
this game.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>What Is Play?</strong></p> 
<p>Before boys can walk, they display a capacity to play, and before they 
begin school they will be old enough in some communities to participate in 
organized sports. Their behavior will be scrutinized in reference to standards 
of behavior we refer to as sportsmanship. But what is play, and what are 
sports? The latter are perhaps easier to define: They are games of physical 
activity with rules that define the terms of engagement, the roles and limits 
on the players, and what players need to do to win.</p> 
<p> A good definition of play can be found in a much quoted paper by Kenneth 
Rubin and his colleagues. They describe play as having five necessary 
characteristics. It is intrinsically motivated, pursued for the sheer 
satisfaction it offers. This aspect most distinguishes play from work, for even 
when work is intrinsically pleasurable, it is also extrinsically motivated: to 
earn income, to enhance status, to support a household, among other 
motivations. Certain activities, however, can begin as work and develop into 
play, and vice versa. The transition can occur in both directions, and a 
specific event may switch back and forth several times.</p> 
<p>Play is also, by definition, freely chosen by the participants. Fergus 
Hughes, who has written incisively about play, recalls a first grader named 
Scott who had no interest in competitive sports but was pressured by both 
parents to join a school soccer team. The games caused Scott so much anxiety 
that he could scarcely eat his supper on the eve of a game. Even gentle 
pressure, Hughes believes, can move activity outside the realm of play.</p> 
<p>Play must be pleasurable, or it isn't play. This criterion raises some 
difficult questions about group activities when what purports to be sport 
consists of someone enjoying making someone else miserable. Patricia Hersch 
observed some seventh-grade boys who play in the same kind of junior football 
league I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter: At the field, the kids 
bound out of the car, happy to see their teammates. They talk about the past 
weekend's game, where they crushed their opponent. Chris is still giddy with 
success: 'I got into a fight with a center and that was the best time I ever 
had-I was talking so much trash, we were crushing Springfield-the center 
started crying and he was swinging at my helmet with bare hands'. It's 
controlled violence, Chris and Brad explain'. If you get run over, blocked or 
something like that, you want to get back. The same thing happened at Lake 
Braddock-I cut-blocked this guy and he said, &quot;Come on, [obscenity], try 
again.&quot; So I did it again,says Chris'. That part of the game is fun to 
me,' adds Brad. 'I like the talking part, but at the end of the game you come 
together and you shake hands and say good job and that resolves the problem. So 
in that period of time you can be mean and violent and dangerous. And then it's 
over.'</p> 
<p>Is what Chris and Brad were doing-trash-talking to inflame an opponent and 
disrupt his concentration, which is common in professional, college, and high 
school sports, and cut-blocking, which is a type of block apt to injure an 
opponent's legs-the kind of pleasure that passes the standard of constituting 
play? Obviously male drives to establish dominance hierarchies and to test an 
opponent's response to physical aggression are an inevitable component in 
contact sports even when played by young boys, and in other sports as well.</p> 
<p> But do we really want to say that an activity, even if it intentionally 
causes displeasure or injury to another player, is still play because it gives 
the inflicter pleasure? When a boy plays fairly to win, and succeeds, he may 
cause the loser displeasure, but that is somewhat incidental, and not 
inevitable, in a competitive game; it's possible to lose and feel satisfied if 
you've tried hard and been treated with respect by your opponent.</p> 
<p> A fourth characteristic of play is its symbolic aspect. There is an 
element of make-believe. Another way of saying it is that play has a nonliteral 
aspect. Baking an actual cake may be fun, but it is work that happens to be 
fun; playing house and baking a pretend cake is play; building an imaginary 
house with Lego is play.</p> 
<p> Finally, play has to be actively engaged in by a person-physically or 
psychologically or both. A boy who is indifferent to what he is doing and what 
is going on about him is not at play. By the same token, I suppose, a fan who 
is completely, vicariously caught up in watching a game might be thought of as 
being at play. He is stressing the symbolic aspect of the experience. He might 
be concentrating on who is winning, on rooting for someone, in which case his 
association with play is borderline; or he may be enjoying the skill of 
players, in which case his activity is more closely related to play. But 
watching is unlikely ever to be the equivalent of playing. This five-part 
definition of play offers guidelines for understanding boys' activities. If a 
parent realizes that he is pressuring a son into participating in a sport, and 
the son clearly doesn't enjoy it and wouldn't pursue it without the pressure, 
the parent might be inspired to think: What is going on here? Is my son having 
any pleasure playing this game or is he being forced against all of his 
inclinations to work to realize his parents' dreams? Or a parent can use such a 
definition to gauge when an activity has ceased to be play, and tactful adult 
intervention might be in order. Parents can also use this definition to monitor 
their own play with their children. That such play is important to a boy's 
development seems beyond doubt. Physical play, including what we call 
roughhousing, begins in early infancy, peaks in most children's experience 
between the ages of one and four, and diminishes gradually. My grandson Noah, a 
fledgling toddler, is very fond of a shortly-before-bedtime game of running and 
getting caught-quite a few times in a row. Several studies have shown that 
children rated as popular by their teachers are the most likely to have parents 
who have engaged in regular physical play with them. Children who are popular 
with their peers are more likely to engage in high levels of physical play with 
them, while rejected children seem to engage in physical play with more 
reluctance.</p> 
<p>Hughes suggests that self-control is among the skills developed by boys in 
physical play with parents.</p> 
<p> Since play of this sort is usually intensely stimulating, the child is 
highly aroused, and, more importantly, the high arousal level must be sustained 
for the duration of the play. When the play is over, however, the child is 
admonished to 'settle down.' Thus the player learns to become intensely engaged 
with another person, to stay engaged, and to disengage when the activity comes 
to an end. Hughes also believes this kind of activity may help a child to read 
the emotional states-happiness, fright, sadness, and so on-of others as they 
are expressed or mimed in play, and to express his own emotions effectively 
with facial expression and gesture.</p> 
<p>Play is the most characteristic activity of children when they aren't 
eating or sleeping or doing assigned chores. It isn't all physically vigorous. 
Reading and being read to can be play. Conversation can be play. Playing a 
musical instrument can be play-should be play, unless the child feels pressured 
into it. As a boy matures, work intrudes more and more into his daily life; 
school is defined as a place of work interrupted by play periods. As folk 
wisdom puts it, &quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,&quot; but 
most schoolboys think their play periods are too brief. The adult 
&quot;workaholic&quot; is a person who has allowed work to overwhelm his 
personal life to the virtual disappearance of play. Average folks try to find 
ways to interrupt work with moments of play; even crumpling paper into a ball 
and sending it to the wastebasket via an air hook worthy of Kareem qualifies as 
play.</p> 
<p>Play, as defined above, is an appetite of lifelong significance for a 
healthy male. Many adult hobbies other than conventional sports can be forms of 
play-woodworking or gardening, for example. Sexual experience often involves 
times of play for the male who doesn't turn it into work, as is acknowledged in 
speaking of foreplay and afterplay. All work and no play makes Jack Senior a 
dull boy, too.</p> 
<p><strong>The Development of Play</strong></p> 
<p> Boys play long before organized sports come into their lives. My concern 
in this chapter is chiefly with the adolescent, but a few words are in order 
about the childhood activities that precede sports and sportsmanship. All of 
the issues apparent in adolescent sports have surfaced in rudimentary form much 
earlier in childhood.</p> 
<p> Infants begin to play even in the first half-year of life. Students of 
child development have taken pains to distinguish the activity of play from the 
activity of exploration. Exploration comes first, logically. Perhaps early 
exploration is the precursor of what a person will eventually regard as work. 
When the environment is, at least in some ways, unfamiliar, the infant tries to 
figure it out. His attention is intense, his heartbeat steady, his demeanor 
serious and often somewhat cautious. His way of exploring an object he can 
grasp-smelling it, putting it in his mouth, rubbing it against his skin-can 
look almost ritualistic.</p> 
<p>Play is more relaxed and joyful than exploration. The infant will 
continuously repeat activities such as sucking or grasping that give him 
pleasure; he will bang on his high chair in the latter half of his first year 
because it amuses him or it appears to amuse someone else, or both. He loves to 
put things into other things and take them out again. By the time he is a year 
old, he might turn a game of pushing aside a pillow to find the toy hidden 
under it into a game of simply repeatedly pushing aside the pillow-the means 
becomes an end in itself.</p> 
<p>During his second year, a boy begins to show a preference to play with more 
than one object at a time; he begins to realize the proper function of 
objects-balls to be rolled or thrown, blocks to be stacked and knocked over; 
and he begins symbolic play-for example, using any available material or toy at 
hand as make-believe food to feed to his stuffed animal. In general, a boy's 
play will be more sophisticated when he is interacting with an adult than when 
he is playing alone.</p> 
<p>Until a child is about twenty months of age, the mother is the principal 
adult playmate of American children. Parents in two-parent homes share play 
activities about equally for the next year; after that, fathers initiate more 
play periods with preschoolers than mothers do. Mothers spend more time with 
them, but the fathers specialize more in playtime. There is a culturally 
defined division of labor here, with mothers specializing in some aspects of 
child care and fathers specializing in other aspects, including play. Fathers 
do more roughhousing, and they also are more inclined to direct the child's 
play activities. Mothers are more likely than fathers to follow the child's 
lead and to emphasize the instructional possibilities in the child's play.</p> 
<p>Research in Sweden and in an Israeli kibbutz did not show the mother-father 
differences observed in the United States, so these patterns are by no means 
universal. There is a point to emphasize here. Some writers on raising boys are 
currently emphasizing fathers' roles, especially in play, suggesting that there 
is a correlation between extensive father-involvement in a boy's upbringing and 
his later success academically and professionally. The implication of this is 
gloomy for boys raised by a single mother. The more likely truth is that boys 
thrive on certain play elements in their lives, including a lot of play that is 
physically active. If fathers don't provide it, others can, with comparable 
consequences for a boy's well being. By &quot;others&quot; I mean mothers or 
hired child care or relatives, or older siblings who've been shown how to do it 
with proper supervision. A playmate, someone to play with regularly, is deeply 
meaningful for a child. In the inclination of males to be directive in their 
play with children, we see a trend that we will come to later. it isn't 
females, predominantly, who have built the elaborately overorganized system of 
sports for boys in the United States, mimicking professional sports with 
uniforms, leagues, intricate scheduling, commercial sponsors, media coverage, 
maintenance of performance records, selection of all-stars, seasons leading to 
playoffs, and enormous emphasis on competitiveness and winning. While both 
fathers and mothers engage in their sons' competitions vicariously, it is 
mostly men who have imposed many of the extrinsic values of their occupations 
on what should be intrinsically pleasurable children's play, and who bear much 
of the responsibility for this invasion of childhood. I should add, however, 
that I have also seen mothers screeching in fury or triumph at ball games.</p> 
<p>Two-year-olds have the advantage of greater mobility and language 
development. Still lacking fine motor skills, they may enjoy the look and feel 
of play materials more than the things they may create with them. Their most 
typical play is solitary, or else onlooker play in which they watch another 
child nearby.</p> 
<p>Three-year-olds show that they are identifying with adults more than 
two-year-olds do. They are better able to wait their turn, share, and 
cooperate. They are becoming interested in making things they can show to 
others. To say it another way, two-year-olds are more interested in process, 
three-year-olds are becoming interested in results. Blocks aren't any longer 
just for stacking; they can be made by the three-year-old into buildings and 
bridges that loosely represent the actual world. There is an expansion of 
fantasy in their play and blurring of the distinction between fantasy and 
reality.</p> 
<p>By the age of four, a boy's advancing fine motor skills usually affect his 
choice of playthings. His increasing sociability enables him to make quite 
elaborate plans with playmates for their play projects. Five-year-olds, having 
begun to show signs of logical thinking, reflect a stability in their play 
missing in most younger boys. Adults see them as more malleable and cooperative 
than younger boys, and they are more willing to share play materials and take 
turns with their peers. The expansion of fantasy in the three-year-olds is 
being countered with a move back to realism by the five-year-olds.</p> 
<p>The social development of children's play was analyzed as early as the 
1930s by Mildren Parten. As two-year-olds, she noted, children engage mostly in 
solitary play and onlooker play. ~When circumstances promote it, children of 
that and later ages will often display parallel play-children playing 
separately at the same activities in the same place and at the same time. 
Three-year-olds, to some extent, but four-year-olds even more, display 
associative play: Each child is doing his or her own thing, but there is 
sharing, lending of toys and materials, and taking turns. Four-year-olds begin 
to demonstrate cooperative play where two or more children engage in play in 
which participants have to fulfill complementary tasks toward a common goal. 
Once that begins most of the issues grouped under the umbrella of sportsmanship 
exist in recognizable form. Researchers today believe Parten underestimated the 
capacity of children as young as a year and a half to play cooperatively, and 
they don't attribute social immaturity to solitary play to the extent Parten 
did; but they still use her typology. In sociodramatic play, older preschoolers 
often imitate the adults in their lives and unwittingly reveal a good deal of 
how they perceive their home lives. They express their urgent needs and also 
express impulses that might be frowned upon if expressed directly-aggression, 
for example, or curiosity about the human body as dramatized in &quot;playing 
doctor.&quot; This kind of play also permits role reversal, as when a child who 
feels relatively helpless about something in real life may play a make-believe 
role with greater power in that situation.</p> 
<p>Children tend to seek out same-sex playmates as early as age two. When 
playing with male peers, boys show more exploratory zeal, and they also are 
likely to engage in forms of play that are traditionally gender-typed. An 
argument can be made for encouraging a mixture of same-gender and cross-gender 
play, since the latter mitigates against gender stereotyping. Play is a central 
part of group day care, with, studies show, mixed findings as to how beneficial 
the experience may be. The experience can stimulate social maturity in a boy, 
but it may also stimulate displays of aggression and resistance to adult 
direction. The degree of variation in quality from one day-care environment to 
another makes it difficult to generalize.</p> 
<p>Similarly, exposure to television has a mixed effect on children's play. 
Excessive exposure to television can inhibit the quality of play of normally 
imaginative children; but children who are relatively unimaginative may be 
stimulated by watching the more intellectually stimulating children's programs 
such as Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street.</p> 
<p> There is now little question that many boys-some very powerfully are 
affected by violence on the television they watch. The average child in the 
United States between ages five and fifteen witnesses about 13,000 killings, 
most of them dramatized but occasionally an actual death. The effects of 
watching violence are both direct and indirect. More exposure leads to more 
violent behavior, to a greater tolerance of violence, to a view of the world as 
a mean and dangerous place where violence is warranted because normal. Boys 
with an early propensity to aggression feed on violence in the media and use it 
to organize and stimulate their behavior. The advent of interactive computer 
games does seem to represent a quantum leap beyond passively watching others 
commit mayhem and murder on the screen, because in many computer games the 
player becomes a participant in the unfolding action and commits dramatized 
violence himself. That is worrisome enough in public arcade machines but more 
sobering when one knows that millions of kids are playing in the privacy of 
their homes with parental consent.</p> 
<p>Less than deserved attention is given, in my view, to the influence on boys 
of violence in televised sports. Dramatized violence within the story line of a 
film or comic book is usually set in a moral context, admittedly often in a 
simplistic way, but there is some attempt to justify the violence within the 
good guys/bad guys formulas. But sports violence doesn't have that context. 
Attempts to injure the opposing quarterback, hockey brawls, bean balls and 
dugout emptying, spitting on officials, flagrant fouls in basketball, none of 
this has even a shred of moral justification. A sports contest is between our 
guys and the other guys, not between the good guys and the bad guys. Yet boys 
grow up watching their elders respond approvingly or indifferently to injuries 
to the &quot;others&quot; in broadcast sports. One view prevalent in the United 
States is that aggressive contact sports such as professional football, hockey, 
and boxing act as a catharsis for the release of hostile energy by athletes and 
spectators, thus reducing incentives by the people caught up in them to revert 
to crime or domestic violence. But, as Myriam Miedzian points out in Boys Will 
Be Boys, &quot;An exhaustive study of heavyweight prizefights held between 1973 
and 1978 and subsequent homicide statistics revealed that U.S. homicides 
increased by 12.46 percent directly after heavyweight championship prizefights. 
The increase was greatest after heavily publicized prizefights.&quot;</p> 
<p>The philosopher Sissela Bok takes the analysis a step further in her recent 
book Mayhem: Violence as Public Entertainment. The long tradition of cathartic 
spectator violence, she notes with bloody examples, extends back to the Roman 
amphitheater where violence was used to entertain and also to encourage in 
spectators an acceptance of official violence in the conquests and 
administration of the empire.</p> 
<p>No one today is nailed to a crucifix and mauled by a Caledonian bear before 
a screaming throng. Yet the effect of viewing violence in organized sports may 
still encourage the expression and acceptance of violence in other forms. We 
risk boys' making use of violence in contexts other than sport: toward 
intimates, and in antisocial acts committed by individuals or groups. Violence, 
I'm afraid, does appear to breed violence, and the forum in which it is most 
frequently bred outside the home is on the field of sport.</p> 
<p>The games of the schoolboy with their often elaborate rules become fiercely 
competitive. It isn't quite enough to play for the thrill of the action. The 
point is also to win. Some psychologists believe that these competitive 
activities fail to qualify as play as defined at the beginning of this chapter, 
and that play as an activity declines swiftly in boys' lives once competitive 
games with rules establish dominance in free activity time. It is true that 
competition and the goal of winning introduce an (often ruinous) extrinsic 
element into these activities, but it is also true that these activities have 
many moments in which all of the defining elements of play appear to be in 
effect. Still, the aggressive behavior and tension generated by the drive to 
win spoil the experience for many boys. The National Alliance for Youth Sports 
says that 45 percent of children have been called names and insulted while 
playing sports (the number may be low, judging from the anecdotes I have 
already offered) and that 70 percent of children have stopped playing 
competitive sports by age thirteen because all the fun has gone out of it.</p> 
<p>Boys' play, Stanley Greenspan points out in Playground Politics, is often 
more assertive and competitive than girls', and boys are encouraged by their 
parents to win, and sometimes kidded or chastised if they fail.</p> 
<p> Greenspan gives a nice example:</p> 
<p>Eight-year-old Michael and his dad are each racing a remote-control car. 
The competition is fierce. Each competitor is trying to navigate his car around 
the couch and under chairs to the finish line. Michael's car crosses the finish 
line first. Dad says, 'You beat me. You're the winner!' and claps loudly at 
Michael's victory.</p> 
<p> On the other hand, Dad and Michael's 10-year-old sister, Ashley, are 
playing Junior Scrabble. Ashley has been getting lots of pieces, and she has 
spelled out more words than her father. But Dad downplays Ashley's interest in 
competing and winning.</p> 
<p>'Dad, I spelled out six more words than you!'Ashley says excitedly.</p> 
<p> 'Those are good words, honey,' Dad says calmly.</p> 
<p>'But I beat you!' Ashley says in frustration.</p> 
<p>'Honey,' says Dad,'that's very nice, but remember, it's just a game.'</p> 
<p> The function of play changes in fundamental ways from the preadolescent to 
the adolescent. While the schoolboy was intensely preoccupied with belonging to 
a peer group, the adolescent begins to single out other individuals with whom 
to develop close friendships. In these relationships, communication is valued 
and practiced. Mere preference for the same play activities isn't as sufficient 
a basis for friendship as it once was; adolescents are looking for 
complementary personalities.</p> 
<p> So for the adolescent play begins to be less structured than it was for 
the preadolescent. Much of it consists of &quot;hanging out&quot; together, 
watching television and videos, listening to music, going to dances and 
parties. There is decreased interest in games with rules. There is a gradual 
decrease in the number of different play activities engaged in per week. Having 
a good time becomes less defined as doing something with friends, more defined 
as being together, enjoying time of one's own.</p> 
<p>Organized team sports continue to enjoy intense commitment among adolescent 
males, but for a declining number of them. As the more athletically talented 
are selected and rewarded with status and recognition, the less talented or 
committed drop out. Yet another way to look at the decline in numbers of males 
committed to organized sports is that they have turned to activities, as I've 
just indicated, that promote less structured hanging out with more intense 
relationships as the goal.</p> <strong>
<p>Organized Sports</p></strong> 
<p>From early childhood through middle childhood to adolescence, organized 
sports play a role in the lives of many children, having increased in 
popularity among children decade by decade in recent history. Thirty million 
school-age children participate in organized sports in the United States. They 
play twenty-five different kinds of sports, directed by a volunteer army of 4.5 
million coaches and 1.5 million administrators. Four year-olds can sign up for 
midget hockey, six-year-olds for Little League baseball. Eleven and 
twelve-year-olds often spend 40 percent of their free activity time engaged in 
organized sports.</p> 
<p> For boys, organized sports offer plenty of instruction, comparatively high 
quality equipment, community recognition, institutionalized self-esteem for 
those who do well, and a ready-made social group. In communities where boyhood 
sports are very highly organized, a boy may feel that he has little choice but 
to participate if he wants to feel deeply attached to his peers; everyone he 
wants to pal around with is playing team sports. Parents often view these 
activities as ways of keeping boys' free time occupied so they won't get into 
trouble inventing activities on their own. Coaches and parents often assert 
that participation in organized sports contributes to self-esteem, particularly 
among boys who are more likely than girls to define themselves in terms of 
athletic accomplishment. Not unexpectedly, several researchers have found a 
positive relationship between successful athletic participation and a child's 
self-esteem as an athlete. But rather than thinking of a boy as having a single 
global self, it is probably more appropriate to think of a set of self-images. 
His self-image as an athlete may be high based on his successful participation 
in the local soccer or football league, but this self-confidence may not be 
equaled by his self-image as a student or as a member of his class or family. 
However, it is also true that athletic achievement in organized sports rewards 
more boys with community recognition than any other activity, and that star 
athletes enjoy as high, or higher, status among peers as any other adolescent 
group.</p> 
<p>Does participation in organized sports contribute, as is often claimed, to 
a boy's character by promoting such values as former United States Senator and 
New York Knickerbocker forward Bill Bradley recently enumerated in Values of 
the Game: passion, discipline, selflessness, respect, perspective, courage, 
leadership, responsibility, resilience, and imagination? Brenda Bredemeier and 
David Shields interviewed high school and college students-some of them 
athletes, some not-asking them to comment on the moral dimension of athletic 
and nonathletic situations. For example, the asked what the interviewee thought 
a football player should do if asked by his coach to try to injure a key player 
on another team.</p> 
<p>What the researchers found was that both athletes and nonathletes believed 
a different and lower set of moral principles applied to sporting events than 
applied to ordinary everyday events. There was a high level of agreement that 
in everyday life one should try to be considerate, but in sports, because of 
the emphasis on winning, one needn't be very concerned about others. They 
found, as Hughes reports, that: &quot;People who have the greatest interest in 
highly aggressive contact sports, or have participated in them for the longest 
amounts of time, tend to score lower on tests of moral reasoning.... Athletes 
who do earn high moral reasoning scores are the least willing to display 
hostile aggression during a game.&quot; Michael Messner, a sociologist, once 
interviewed Art Tatum, an Oakland Raiders linebacker whose tackle in one game 
broke Darryl Stingley's neck, leaving him paralyzed. &quot;When I first started 
playing,&quot; Tatum told Messner, &quot;if I would hit a guy hard and he 
wouldn't get up, it would bother me. (But) when I was a sophomore in high 
school, first game, I knocked out two quarterbacks, and people loved it. The 
coach loved it. Everybody loved it * &quot;</p> 
<p> In boys' organized sports, coaches have immense influence. As Michael 
Oriard, who played football through school years and then for Notre Dame and 
the Kansas City Chiefs reported, &quot;From the fourth grade into my first year 
as a professional, I was to look to my coaches as figures of wisdom and 
authority whose pronouncements were gospel and whose expectations of me were to 
be met at whatever cost.&quot; The coaches are teachers and strategists, but 
just as much they are motivators; some use rather bizarre methods to provoke 
the level of enthusiasm they desire in a team. A high school coach in Wisconsin 
gave a &quot;Hit of the Week&quot; award to the player who appeared from 
analysis of game films to have made the most vicious hit on an opposing 
football player. Another coach from Iowa painted a chicken gold to represent 
the rival &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; and had his team kick it around the field 
to &quot;get the Eagle.&quot; A phenomenon referred to as &quot;doubling&quot; 
often takes place in organized sports whereby the players conform to a frame of 
mind and a moral code imposed by an authoritarian coach. The players have 
implicitly abandoned responsibility for their own actions to the direction of 
coaches and public sentiment. Thus a player who in ordinary situations is 
well-mannered and friendly may become extremely aggressive and callous about 
inflicting injuries when he is within the team culture.</p> 
<p>Part of the equation is that the player is also supposed to be indifferent 
to his own injuries; but he may remain anxious about being injured himself The 
sight of football players kneeling together in prayer in a stadium after a game 
in which they have often tried to injure others suggests the irony that 
afflicts sports where competitive values have overwhelmed other values. One 
lineman in the 1999 Super Bowl, Denver Broncos guard Mark Schlereth, has had 
twenty-two operations for sports injuries-seventeen times on his knees-and will 
have a twenty-third a week after the game. &quot;No doctor in his right mind 
would ever pass me for a physical if his job were on the line,&quot; Mark says, 
&quot;but this is the NFL. If they want you to pass the physical, you will pass 
the physical.&quot; In fact, some teams have given him physicals and turned him 
down based on the findings. But one of the best teams signed him. He can't bend 
over to putt a golf ball, and he can't crawl on the floor to play with his 
kids, but he's still going to put his body on the line in the Super Bowl.</p> 
<p>Brenda Bredemeier measured the attitudes of high school and college 
basketball players toward intentionally hurting their opponents on the court. 
Boys more than girls were inclined to endorse such acts, and older, experienced 
athletes more than novices.</p> 
<p>Something akin to &quot;doubling&quot; also occurs between players or 
teams, and officials. Officials are as human as players. Players seldom perform 
without error in contests, and officials make mistakes of judgment and 
observation. But more and more, teams cede all moral responsibility to the 
officials. If officials make errors that everyone acknowledges, few players or 
coaches from the side that has benefited volunteer to correct the situation. It 
is usually considered the prerogative of the players in officiated contests to 
accept as unearned blessings the benefits of officiating errors. In many sports 
it is the habit of players and coaches who believe an official has made an 
error to their disadvantage to react in extravagant accusatory fashion.</p> 
<p> Failure to display aggressiveness and self abandonment desired by coaches 
and teammates subjects adolescent athletes frequently to suggestions that they 
are feminine or homosexual. Ira Berkow once reported in the New York Times that 
the men's basketball coach at the University of Indiana Bobby Knight &quot;put 
a box of sanitary napkins in the locker of one of his players so that the 
player would get the point that Knight considered him less than 
masculine.&quot; Dave Meggyesy, a former football player, says &quot;this sort 
of attack on a player's manhood is a coach's doomsday weapon. And it almost 
always works, for the players have wrapped up their identity in their 
masculinity, which is eternally precarious for it not only depends on not 
exhibiting fear of any kind on the playing field, but is also something that 
can be given and withdrawn by a coach at his pleasure, &quot; Without doubt, 
this denigration of the feminine contributes to the potential for male athletes 
to be manipulative and exploitative in their relationships with real females.
</p> 
<p><strong>The Decline of Play</strong></p> 
<p>The intrinsic delight of play certainly has been overwhelmed by extrinsic 
considerations in much of the organized sports we see for boys in the United 
States. As collegiate and professional sports have become an ever larger 
entertainment industry, swamping amateurism or making it a subsidized sham in 
sport after sport, organized sports have become talent selection systems 
feeding the ranks of high school and college teams and rosters as a prelude to 
the eventual recognition of the small number of players who will prosper in 
professional competitions. The premise is statistical. The more boys that try 
to master a given sport, the more likely it is that those with superior natural 
talent and trainability will be identified. Even given as large a pool of 
children as the United States has to draw upon, there remain sports in which 
American athletes consistently do poorly in international competition compared 
to athletes from much smaller countries where those sports are emphasized.</p> 
<p>Organized sports make those who fail at the early levels feel unwarrantedly 
discouraged, and it makes many of those who succeed exaggeratedly 
self-regarding. The system is very steeply pyramidal in every sport. Few of the 
elementary, middle school, and high school &quot;stars&quot; will excel in 
collegiate sports, and few of those who play college varsity sports will find a 
professional career awaiting them.</p> 
<p>Clearly organized sports excite the upward social mobility strivings of 
many families who see athletic prowess in their sons as a talent that will pull 
the entire family into greater prominence and security. The values that are 
being reinforced in organized sports are not so much the traditional values of 
&quot;sportsmanship&quot; but the core values of a society that has made sports 
into a business: individual competitiveness; a facade of self confidence; the 
demonstration of earnest effort; a provisional willingness to bear pain and 
injury for the greater good of the company, yet an apprehension that loyalty is 
pretty much a one-way street, not to be reciprocated if the company loses 
confidence in the value of the individual; indifference to those who lose out 
in competition; willingness to be aggressive and to injure others in the 
interests of one's team.</p> 
<p>Dave Meggyesy puts the best possible face on it when he says that 
&quot;football represents the core values of the status quo, and coaches and 
school administrators want players to win adherence to these values, not only 
on the football field but also in their private lives.&quot; But it is hardly 
surprising that for every Bill Bradley there are several prominent athletes 
being prosecuted for drug violations and sexual assaults, being pursued, 
despite seven-figure salaries, for nonpayment of alimony and child support or 
in paternity suits. Beyond the misbehavior of individual athletes there lies an 
undercurrent of corruption among the administrators and officials of organized 
sports. The recent Olympics scandals show how this reaches to the top echelons.
</p> 
<p>An observer can't help but note the irony that the sports into which most 
boys are organized are not, by and large, the games they will play as adults. 
They are organized in largest numbers into baseball, football, soccer, hockey, 
and basketball. As adults they will watch these games in large numbers, but 
they won't play them. And not just because they've lost the physical skills to 
play them enjoyably. I suspect they don't play adult basketball and baseball 
because such games were ruined for them as kids. They remember them as tense 
and conflictual, so they trade them in for golf, hiking, jogging, swimming, 
fishing-trying to recover activities that might be playful for them.</p> 
<p> In my own childhood and youth, I played far more music than sports. But I 
asked a contemporary of mine what he remembered of the games of our summers and 
after-schools and weekends. Here is what, in essence, he said: What organized 
sports has substantially displaced was an informal network of neighborhood or 
interneighborhood activities that boys organized themselves. What we used to 
call &quot;pickup games.&quot; The old way offered less instruction, and the 
equipment was less adequate, so boys had to invent game sites in yards and 
streets and share equipment. There was little, if any, community recognition 
outside the group and their families. No status, but plenty of fun. We'd play 
until we were tired, and then we'd sit around and talk, and then maybe get up 
and play some more.</p> 
<p>Since neighborhood sports were self-governed, boys themselves dealt with 
all the issues of fair play, and I have no doubt that the process was more 
educational from a character standpoint than many boys find in organized sports 
today. Leaders always emerged. They were the ones whom everyone expected to be 
in charge of a side or team, and to choose its members. Leaders were always 
among the best players but weren't necessarily the very best; they were, 
however, natural leaders whose influence we instinctively recognized and 
honored. Rules were kept as simple as possible because the players had to 
interpret and implement them, and no one wanted a game to break down over a 
rules controversy. There were arguments about how specific plays were to be 
governed by the rules-heated arguments at times- but everyone knew the process 
had to come to consensus.</p> 
<p> Boys who didn't fit in were gradually excluded until~ they came to 
understand what stood between them and inclusion, and made an accommodation 
acceptable to the other boys. Generally it wasn't talent or the lack thereof 
that kept anyone on the sidelines. I don't remember any boys getting excluded 
because they were untalented. Anyone who played with obvious intent to injure 
others was eased out. Chronic whiners were eased out because the games were 
meant to be fun, and a good whiner could take the euphoria out of a game very 
rapidly.</p> 
<p> The best games were those with evenly matched sides and close scores; then 
everyone felt good at the end, because with a lucky break here or there the 
game could credibly have gone the other way. If a game got one-sided, it 
usually ended sooner because it ceased to be enough fun. Left to their own 
devices, boys can develop impressive neighborhood conventions of sportsmanship.
</p> <strong>
<p>Sportsmanship</p></strong> 
<p>In my conversations with boys, sports came up over and over again. In 
Chapter 18, 1 referred to Brett. His yard and the street outside the fence were 
full of his contemporaries who had come over to play when I arrived to talk 
with him and his single mother. Talking with him reminded me of the patterns of 
my childhood. Some days the kids (mostly boys, but-unlike my childhood 
days-also some girls who like sports) congregate at Brett's house, other days 
at the home of another member of the crowd. Neighborhood play needs parental 
attention and involvement that organized sports delegate to coaches and 
managers. The logistics of organized sports lead to a lot of parents standing 
on the sidelines watching others work with their kids, waiting to take them 
home again. I saw a fine kind of parent-child interaction when I visited Evan 
and his mother. She is a single mother who works, so Evan, an only child in 
early adolescence, usually gets home a couple of hours before his mother; he 
immediately checks in with her by telephone.</p> 
<p>One of their main sports issues is the trampoline in the backyard. The rule 
Margaret and Evan have agreed to is that no one uses the trampoline unless she 
is at home. Another rule is that other kids can't come into the house to play 
while his mother is at work. Evan volunteered that the issue is one of safety. 
&quot;Do your friends ever want to jump on the trampoline when your mother is 
at work?&quot; I asked him. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he replied. &quot;One guy keeps 
asking and asking, and he gets mad, but I keep saying no. Sometimes he waits 
until my mom arrives, and then he wants me to ask permission right away; and I 
tell him to let her have a breather.&quot; (Evan and his mother, incidentally, 
are right to be concerned. Trampolines caused 249,000 accidents, and the annual 
frequency of injury doubled, between 1990 and 1995; they are now among the 
leading causes of childhood injury.) Evan and Margaret also appreciate what he 
has gained from his relationships with coaches in organized sports. &quot;One 
of my coaches,&quot; Evan says, &quot;was always encouraging when people made 
mistakes. He'd say things like 'We'll get them next time' and 'You can do 
it.&quot;'</p> 
<p>The values that we associate with sportsmanship-including the 
thoughtfulness and regard for safety articulated by Evan-are inestimably 
valuable aspects of male character. They imply attainment of an admirable 
civility or courteousness, regard both for rules and for the welfare of 
everyone playing the game, self-control when something upsetting or frustrating 
has occurred, a capacity to win without overvaluing the victory, and to lose 
without taking it overly to heart, and a sense of proportion that focuses much 
of the time on the sheer pleasure of the game. The question is: 'WHere does 
sportsmanship come from? Bill Bradley suggests that the several values we refer 
to collectively as sportsmanship come from the game itself. He played 
collegiate basketball at Princeton where, with luck, there might be a player 
with potential to star as a professional once in a decade or a generation. 
~&quot;at Princeton had was a remarkable coach, Pete Carril, who taught his 
intelligent squad to play a very deliberate, controlled style that enabled them 
to perform well against-and often beat-teams with much more natural talent but 
far less discipline. In his years with the New York Knicks, Bradley played with 
a similarly intelligent and disciplined team. Times change, however, and his 
old team, the Knicks, have been negotiating, while I've been writing this 
chapter, a contract with a professional player of undisputed talent who has 
been under suspension for several months for assaulting the coach of his former 
team during a practice session, choking him and threatening to kill him.</p> 
<p>The chapter on responsibility in Bradley's Values of the Game has the 
subtitle, &quot;No Excuses-None.&quot; It is an interesting tack because sports 
postmortems are as rife with lame excuses as those in any other kind of human 
endeavor; and the ability to take responsibility for one's actions when they 
haven't turned out well is a benchmark of character. Bradley gave an example 
from which he drew the subtitle of the chapter.</p> 
<p>The coach who gets across the importance of punctuality introduces order 
into many a young life.... On Red Holzman's teams, there were few rules, but 
they were rigid. His attitude was 'No excuses-none!' if you weren't on the bus 
at the designated time, it left without you. If you didn't make the plane, you 
paid your own way. If you were late for practice, even two minutes late, you 
were fined. The result was that most of us turned up early. Even if you were 
late because of circumstances clearly beyond your control, you got no sympathy 
or credit.' Sure, Bill, I know your mother's cousin called with an emergency 
that your mother's nephew couldn't take care of,' Holzman used to say, 'and it 
rained on the highway and made it slick, after the earthquake damaged the 
bridge, but still you're fined.' He smiled and I paid up. To me, the example 
doesn't point the way to exemplary character at all. This is not what taking 
responsibility or refusing to make excuses for oneself is about.</p> 
<p>Bradley recalls a rule for which no exception was ever granted-a rule that 
was worthwhile but hardly worth making into the eleventh commandment: Thou 
shalt be punctual. Suppose, to underline the shallowness and rigidity of the 
rule, we turn the story around and have Bill Bradley, arriving punctually for 
practice, report to Holzman, &quot;Boy, the roads were a sheet of ice this 
morning and I had no tread on my tires. I drove seventy miles an hour to get 
here, spun out twice, ran three cars off the road and roared past an accident 
where it looked like they needed some help. But I got here on time.&quot; And 
Red Holzman smiles and says, &quot;That's my boy.&quot;</p> 
<p>The values of sportsmanship-including a suppleness to make wise choices in 
demanding circumstances-are values that boys bring to sports as much as, or 
more than, they learn from sports. The characterological difference between a 
Bill Bradley and a Latrell Sprewell, the choker traded to the Knicks, was 
established long before either got a contract to play professional basketball, 
or even college ball.</p> 
<p> The development of these values begins in the first years of a boy's life 
as his play is influenced by interaction with his parents and other adults, and 
with siblings. Those first experiences in the delight of play, accompanied by 
the inevitable tensions of sharing and cooperating with others, stand behind a 
boy as he begins to participate in schoolyard play with a peer group. There 
such factors as dominance hierarchies, individual aggressiveness, and group 
prejudices continually threaten the integrity of play as we've defined it in 
this chapter. Sportsmanship, in a sense, consists of a set of values and 
techniques to keep human nastiness from ruining play.</p> 
<p> The ambiguity of organized sports for boys is that they often confusingly 
support both sides of the equation. Sportsmanship is always given lip service 
in youth sports, and often there is some substance to it; but at the same time 
there is support for nastiness: overaggressiveness, demonizing the opponent, 
deliberately injuring others, taking foolish risks, and exaggerating the 
significance of winning. Each boy can assimilate what pleases him. If a boy 
demonstrates superior talent in organized sports, but also displays behavior 
that is offensive, his behavior is sometimes tolerated in order to keep his 
talent available to the team.</p> 
<p>For these reasons, I view sportsmanship as something a boy more likely 
brings to the sport than vice versa. Sports can support the development of a 
boy's character, or they can degrade it. Because of the prominence of athletes 
in the social hierarchies of teenagers, and the number of young male athletes 
who offend against others, girls in particular, I think we need to impose some 
rules about who is allowed to play in organized sports. Any serious antisocial 
behavior should prompt a serious and careful review of a boy's suitability for 
what has to be seen as an unelected leadership position. If his values and 
choices suggest that he will use his prestige and power to exploit others, he 
should probably be barred from organized sports until, through a process of 
education, noncompetitive athletics, community service, and counseling, he is 
able to demonstrate values of respect and fairness that would serve him well 
under the stress of competition. Drawing him into organized sports as a 
rehabilitative gesture because he will learn &quot;sportsmanship&quot; there 
places unwarranted expectations on those sports. The exemplary coach certainly 
exists who can take a troubled boy and guide him into a U-turn. But I believe 
there are many other coaches who will exacerbate the flaws.</p>
