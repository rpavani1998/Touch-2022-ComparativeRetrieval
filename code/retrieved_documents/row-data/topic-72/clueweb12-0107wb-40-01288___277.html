<h2>2012-2013 Social Venture Accelerator<br>
 Program and Application Overview
</h2> 
<p>Feedback Deadline: March 16th, 2012, 5:00pm<br>
 Application Deadline: 
March 30th, 2012, 5:00pm</p> 
<p>New Ventures Accelerator Overview:</p> 
<p>Social entrepreneurs are innovative problem solvers who are passionate 
about solving what others may see as intractable social problems. They play a 
tremendous and critical role in solving our city&rsquo;s biggest challenges. 
The SENO Social Venture Accelerator was designed in partnership with globally 
recognized social entrepreneurship nonprofit Echoing Green. The Accelerator 
helps early-stage ventures become operational, reach financial sustainability, 
and meet social impact targets through hands-on support from paid consultants 
in areas of need, pro bono professional services (legal, accounting, graphic 
design, marketing, etc.), a network of mentors and experts, timely connections, 
peer learning opportunities, and increased exposure for the venture.</p> 
<p>2011 SENO Accelerator Fellows generated a 1500% return on investment, 
bringing in over $1.5 million in external financing and revenues and creating 
17 new jobs since the beginning of the program. Please visit our website to 
learn more about the 2011 Accelerator Fellows.</p> 
<p>Application Process</p> 
<p>1. Complete the online application by Friday, March 30, 2012, 5:00pm. For 
feedback on applications, submit draft application by Friday, March 16th, 2012, 
5:00pm toinfo@seno-nola.org. We recommend that you type your answers into the 
essay worksheet before submitting online, as the online application will not 
allow you to save your responses. We may follow up with you for clarification 
of your responses.<br>
 2. If you are selected for the second round, we will 
invite you to provide additional materials and to schedule an interview. We 
encourage early applications and may begin the interview process at any time.
<br> 3. If you are selected as a 2012 Fellow, SENO will inform you of the 
decision, and you will be assigned an Accelerator Consultant and Executive 
Mentor who will work with you on your venture approximately 6-8 hours/week to 
help you meet your top financial sustainability and social impact goals. The 
program will officially begin June 1, 2012.</p> 
<p>Program Details:</p> 
<p>&bull; SENO will select 13-15 high-potential social entrepreneur Fellows 
who have innovative solutions to high-priority problems in New Orleans<br>
 
&bull; We work with the Fellows in a 10-month engagement (Jan. 1, 2012-March 
31, 2013) to test and implement his/her promising new approach to solving a 
problem<br>
 &bull; We begin with an organizational assessment, which includes 
a financial, operational, and programmatic review<br>
 &bull; Together, we set 
and reach short- and long-term goals through our Milestone Activity Plan (MAP) 
for deep social impact and financial sustainability<br>
 &bull; Support occurs 
in areas such as:<br>
 &bull; Building financial models<br>
 &bull; Making 
introductions to potential clients, funders, policymakers, investors, and/or 
media<br>

 &bull; Market analysis<br>
 &bull;

review, etc.<br>
 &bull; We assemble a team for each social entrepreneur made 
up of an Accelerator Consultant, Executive Mentor, and pro-bono professionals 
(legal, marketing, financial, etc.)<br>
 &bull; Paid Accelerator Consultants 
will spend 6-8 hours per week working hands-on with social entrepreneurs in 
areas of need determined by the social entrepreneur. Past areas of need 
included business planning, market analysis, financial management, and 
executive coaching.<br>
 &bull; Pro-bono professionals will be customized to 
each social entrepreneur and may occur in areas such as legal, financial 
management, quantifying impact, fundraising, accounting, communications, 
back-office, marketing, and social media.<br>
 &bull; Executive Mentors and 
SENO will help participants make timely &ldquo;people connections&rdquo; to 
help the social entrepreneur build a larger network of supporters and resources.
<br> &bull; Our goal is for over 80% of social entrepreneurs in our cohort to 
reach their top social impact and financial sustainability goals.<br>
 &bull; 
Fellows meet monthly as a group to learn from one another, find solutions, and 
share challenges, resources, and successes.<br>
 &bull; SENO has partnered with 
internationally recognized social entrepreneurship nonprofits. As an Echoing 
Green Fast Track Search partner, SENO will recommend two Fellows to 
automatically advance to the Echoing Green Semifinalist round. As an Ashoka

<p><strong>SENO 2011 Accelerator Fellow Experiences:</strong></p> 
<p>Fellow John Burns // Jack &amp; Jake&rsquo;s: Jack and Jake&rsquo;s is one 
of the first in the U.S. to establish a local food hub (with a network of over 
200 local farms and fishers within 65 miles of New Orleans) where farm fresh 
products and seafood can be efficiently gathered and distributed to those who 
need access to affordable healthy food. Jack &amp; Jake&rsquo;s has secured 
financing since the start of the New Ventures Accelerator to begin operations 
and created 7 new positions.</p> 
<p>Testimonial: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without SENO. I would 
definitely recommend SENO&rsquo;s Accelerator program to another social 
entrepreneur. My SENO consultant was a professional who had a skill set that I 
didn&rsquo;t have and someone that I trusted. Jon Atkinson was a huge help to 
me at a time when I could not afford to bring on help. He initially served as 
my acting CFO. I needed support on the business end of Jack and Jake&rsquo;s, 
and Jon has helped me&hellip;in seeking out new capital, helped to get meetings 
with potential investors, and helping me set up the financial infrastructure 
and systems on the ground.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Fellow Tippy Tippens // MATTER L3C: MATTER L3C is an industrial design 
&amp; consulting studio based in New Orleans, uniquely focused on raising 
awareness and funding initiatives that advance social change. MATTER 
L3C&rsquo;s first product, BirdProject, is a black bird-shaped biodiesel soap 
with a white ceramic keepsake inside whose profits go towards wetland 
restoration.</p> 
<p>Testimonial: &ldquo;The SENO Accelerator has made all the difference in the 
world. SENO is better than a fairy godmother. I was accepted into the program 
at just the right time and am incredibly grateful. I don&rsquo;t know what I 
would have done without SENO since I don&rsquo;t have the possibility of hiring 
someone for all of these different tasks. Because of SENO&rsquo;s Accelerator, 
I feel like I have a team now. I have an MBA who helps develop and explain 
financial models to me [Accelerator Consultant], my own accountant [Pro Bono 
Professional], the head of a marketing firm who designed my website 
[Accelerator Consultant], a legal person [Pro Bono Professional], and an 
Executive Mentor [Kay Morrison, Founder of the Occasional Wife] with a 
background in retail. I definitely would recommend SENO&rsquo;s Accelerator 
program to up-and-coming social entrepreneurs. I&rsquo;ve made so much progress 
since the start of the program&ndash;SENO has helped to reduce wasted time, 
quicken the learning curve, and cut out some of the baby steps in the 
beginning.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Fellow William Stoudt // Youth Rebuilding New Orleans: YRNO is a 
not-for-profit organization, started by youth and for youth, allows students to 
help with purchasing and rebuilding homes, repairing them using volunteer 
participation, and selling the properties to deserving teachers whom could 
otherwise not afford the homes. So far, 5 houses have been bought and sold.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;SENO&rsquo;s Accelerator has helped me accelerate the progress of my 
venture. SENO has provided a lot of necessary first steps in getting an idea 
from idea phase to actually functioning. For example, we didn&rsquo;t have 
legitimate accounting and Quickbooks, a business plan, a strategic plan, we 
weren&rsquo;t tracking the teachers we were trying to help, and we didn&rsquo;t 
have a timeline for projects. My Accelerator Consultant is Tess Monaghan, 
Executive Director of Build Now, and she has been great in giving me an extra 
set of hands while I am a one-person company. It&rsquo;s like having two 
people. Tess has also had experience doing many of the things I&rsquo;m facing 
for the first time, like our project timeline. It saves a lot of time. Tess 
runs a housing nonprofit herself, and she already had something very similar 
for Build Now. So, she just went ahead and changed everything up to fit 
YRNO&rsquo;s situation. We are slated for 11 houses by the end of the 
Accelerator program. Our Executive Mentor is Carey Shea, Executive Director of 
Project Home Again, and she has helped me quite a bit with fundraising and 
grantwriting since I haven&rsquo;t done that before. In addition to consulting 
and services SENO has provided, the program also gives you an opportunity to 
meet with peers. Even if they don&rsquo;t have similar business plans, they 
have similar challenges. You&rsquo;re not alone. You have a sounding board you 
need to test a lot of the ideas and talk the problems that you&rsquo;re having. 
Also, the Accelerator Corps gives you the tools you need in the beginning 
stages helps you with the random issues that come up.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WYES Update</h2> 
<p>Here are a few highlights at the beginning of 2012. Pick a couple of the 
areas below that you are interested in and find out what is going on.</p> 
<p>Emmy. We have received an award for our production of NEW ORLEANS 
RESTAURANTS WITH A PAST, producer Peggy Scott Laborde&rsquo;s homage to our 
heritage of great restaurants. A wonderful program about our superb culinary 
traditions.</p> 
<p>Programming from PBS. The return of MASTERPIECE &ldquo;Downton Abbey&rdquo; 
has been the latest PBS program to gather lots of attention. If you were an 
aficionado of &ldquo;Upstairs, Downstairs,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll love this 
series, Sundays at 9p.</p> 
<p>Local Productions. The debut of WYES CONVERSATIONS (Fridays at 8p) was a 
public affairs breakthrough for us, as we interviewed the newsmakers rather 
than the media. Producer Marcia Kavanaugh and INFORMED SOURCES producer Errol 
Laborde spent 30 minutes with both Congressmen Steve Scalise and Jeff Landry.
</p> 
<p>WYES National Productions. Chef John Besh will go into production this 
spring on his second national cooking series, as we have been able to raise the 
funding to begin work.</p> 
<p>Channels 12.1, 12.2, 12.3. If you haven&rsquo;t noticed yet, WYES now 
broadcasts on three different channels, all of which are carried on most cable 
services. THE PBS NEWHOUR, for example, can be seen at 9p on 12.2 (World), and 
if you missed John Besh on 12.1 (WYES-HD), you&rsquo;ll find it airing on 12.3 
(Create).</p> 
<p>http://www.wyes.org. Our website continues to grow. If you go there now, 
you can check out AMERICAN GRADUATE. Funded by the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, this project recently convened a forum to discuss the dropout 
issue in our region and what can be done about it.</p> 
<p>Educational Outreach. We have formed a partnership with The Sankofa Farmers 
Market and are screening SESAME STREET &ldquo;Growing Hope Against 
Hunger.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Membership. The December membership drive was better than last 
year&rsquo;s, perhaps indicating the slow continuing improvement in the 
economy. The most successful program was NEW ORLEANS IN THE &lsquo;50&rsquo;S, 
not only raising the most money, but attracting the most Producers Circle 
($1,200+) on-air contributions ever.</p> 
<p>Federal Support. Our regular federal funding through the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting remains secure for the moment. But Congress did eliminate 
the matching grants program for equipment through the Department of Commerce. 
This was the program that replaced all our production equipment after Katrina.

<h2>The Creative Alliance and Moving Stories</h2> 
<p>Creative Alliance of New Orleans and Moving Stories Dance Project are 
currently accepting applications for Creative Capital&rsquo;s Core Curriculum 
Workshop presented on March 9-11, 2012. This one of a kind opportunity has been 
described as a &ldquo;crash course in self-management, strategic planning, 
fundraising and promotion&rdquo; for artists of all creative genres. The 
Creative Capital Workshop takes artists on a two and one-half day retreat led 
by nationally renowned arts professionals. The experience is limited to 24 
artists from Louisiana. Applications can be found athttp://cano-la.org. 
Applications will be reviewed by a selection committee with the goal of 
assembling a very diverse group of artists from varied artistic genres and 
cultural backgrounds. Applicants must create original works. We encourage 
visual artists, composers, filmmakers, choreographers and all other mediums to 
apply. This is the first time that Creative Capital&rsquo;s workshop will be 
held in New Orleans. While many different forms of art are flourishing in New 
Orleans, it is still tough for local artists to create a sustainable income for 
themselves. The Creative Capital Workshop intends to change this situation.</p> 
<p>Some of the skills that will be taught are:&middot;</p> 
<p>&middot;financial planning basics, including choosing financial partners, 
best practices for savings and retirement planning, options for reducing debt 
and acquiring property.<br>
 &middot;the essentials for operating your art as a 
small, independently run business, including employment, contracts, 
negotiation, decision-making, budgeting and cash flow<br>
 &middot;strategies 
for funding your work and revenue-generating, including improving your 
fundraising materials; working in partnership with venues, donors and funders, 
building a base of individual contributors; and knowing the real cost of your 
work so you can communicate it to funders, presenters and other partners<br>
 
&middot;how to consider promoting your work as an integral, natural part of the 
creativeprocess<br>
 &middot;the best practices for artist websites, blogs, 
social media and communications<br>
 &middot;how to identify and reach new 
audiences for your work</p> 
<p>The Creative Alliance and Moving Stories believe that this program presents 
an opportunity for Louisiana artists to learn new methods in improving their 
professional careers in the arts. Please go to our websitehttp://cano-la.org to 
apply. This program is able to be presented thanks to the Joan Mitchell 
Foundation, Creative Capital and in kind support from the Joan Mitchell Center.

<h2>Gulfsouth Youth Action Fund<br>
 A program of Operation REACH, Inc.</h2> 
<p>Apply Today to Fund Youth-led Projects!</p> 
<p>General Overview<br>
 The Gulfsouth Youth Action Fund (GYAF) is a youth-led 
philanthropy initiative developed in 2007 by Operation REACH, Inc., in 
conjunction with the Greater New Orleans Foundation (GNOF), and made possible 
through generous support from the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana 
Foundation, The Starbucks Foundation, and Legacy&reg; Foundation, as well as 
private donations. The GYAF engages, empowers and inspires youth with resources 
to make strategic investments in creating youth-driven change in their 
community.<br>
 The Gulfsouth Youth Action Fund&rsquo;s Youth Advisory Board 
supports progressive, youth-led and youth-driven initiatives that demonstrate 
the power of youth motivated to create change in their community. Grant awards 
range from $500 to $5,000.</p> 
<p>Special Grant Program<br>
 This year, we are offering two grant award 
opportunities. In addition to our general GYAF grant funding, applicants can 
also apply for a Legacy Tobacco Control Grant (LTCG) focused on community 
health. These grants are funded through the Legacy&reg; Foundation based in 
Washington, DC. We will be awarding 5 grants up to $2,500 each for youth-led, 
adult supported projects that specifically address tobacco use in New Orleans. 
Applying for these funds does not restrict you from applying for a general GYAF 
grant.</p> 
<p>We encourage youth to submit well-written and carefully thought-out 
concepts for our funding consideration. It is important for youth to be 
involved in the creation of this proposal.</p> 
<p>Letters of Intent will be accepted now until 5:00 p.m. C.S.T.<br>
 on 
Wednesday, November 23rd, 2011.</p> 
<p>Proposals are due Friday, December 16th, 2011 by 5:00 p.m. C.S.T. </p>

<h2>KID smART</h2> 
<p>How can you help students change their reading and writing from a plodding 
monotone voice to an expressive voice? By introducing the powerful 
relationships between music, the expressive language of poetry, and reading and 
writing.</p> 
<p>Prosody refers to the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry, and the 
patterns of stress and intonation in language. Through a detailed study of the 
elements of prosody &ndash; rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, repetition, and form 
&ndash; students learn to write poetry with cadence and flow.</p> 
<p>Later, through an exploration of the elements of vocal expression &ndash; 
dynamics, tempo, inflection, repetition, and rest &ndash; students learn to 
read their writing with fluency and expression. Join musician and national 
teaching artist Marcia Daft for a course that will transform the way you think 
about teaching poetry in your classroom. Use the techniques presented in this 
course and watch students&rsquo; writing skills transform.</p>

<h2>Center for Social Inclusion</h2> 
<p><strong>New Orleans Community Activist Awarded National Fellowship</strong>
</p> 
<p>Gina Womack, co-founder and executive director of Friends and Families of 
Louisiana&rsquo;s Incarcerated Children (FFLIC), has been named a 2011 Alston 
Bannerman Fellow. The Alston Bannerman Fellowship is a national award presented 
by the Center for Social Inclusion (CSI) that honors longtime community 
activists of color and gives them the opportunity to take sabbaticals. Ms. 
Womack is one of six fellows selected this year.</p> 
<p>The Alston Bannerman Fellowship appreciates that community organizing is 
vital and demanding work, which gets too little recognition or reward. Without 
time to rest and reenergize, the pressures of the work can prove overwhelming 
and result in a loss of creative and critical leadership. To sustain their 
efforts, the Alston Bannerman Fellowship gives organizers of color the 
resources to take three months off for reflection and renewal.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Gina Womack exemplifies the kind of leadership that the Alston 
Bannerman Fellowship was created to reward,&rdquo; said Madeleine Adamson, 
Coordinator of the program. &ldquo;She has built an organization that began as 
a small support group for parents of incarcerated children into a force for 
change in Louisiana. And she has done it by empowering families to take 
leadership.&rdquo; FFLIC&rsquo;s successes include sweeping reforms that closed 
two juvenile prisons. Currently, the organization is working diligently to 
interrupt the school to prison pipeline.</p> 
<p>The other Alston Bannerman Sabbatical Fellows for 2011 are:</p> 
<p>&bull; Chung-Wha Hong, New York Immigration Coalition, New York, NY<br>
 
&bull; Barbara Poley, The Hopi Foundation, Kykotsmovi, AZ<br>
 &bull; Jamala 
Rogers Organization for Black Struggle, St. Louis, MO<br>
 &bull; Kabzuag Vaj, 
Freedom, Inc., Madison, WI<br>
 &bull; Marcos Vargas, Central Coast Alliance 
for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE), Ventura, CA</p> 
<p>Founded in 1988, the Alston Bannerman Program has awarded 202 Fellowships 
to activists of color across the United States and its territories. The Program 
is named in honor of the late Charles Bannerman, a lifelong community organizer 
in Mississippi, and the late Dana Alston, a leader of the environmental justice 
movement.</p> 
<p>The Center for Social Inclusion, which assumed the fellowship program three 
years ago, is a national policy advocacy organization based in New York City. 
CSI develops ideas, leadership, and communications strategies to dismantle 
structural barriers to opportunity for communities of color and increase 
wellbeing for all.</p>

<h2>The Big Uneasy</h2>

</strong></p> 
<p>Sunday, July 24th<br>
 Playing in New Orleans @ 2pm<br>
 The Ogden Museum 
of Southern Art</p> 
<p><em>The Big Uneasy</em> is the first documentary by long-time 
&ldquo;mockumentarian&rdquo; Harry Shearer (of<em>Spinal Tap</em> and <em>The 
Simpsons</em>). The film follows three remarkable people&ndash;the leaders of 
two scientific investigation teams, and one whistleblower&ndash;as they reveal 
the true story of why New Orleans flooded, and why it could happen in other 
cities across America. Shearer speaks to the tireless investigators and experts 
who poked through the muck as the water receded, and uncovers a courageous 
whistle-blower from the Army Corps of Engineers. His dogged pursuit of facts 
reveals that some of the same flawed methods responsible for levee failure 
during Hurricane Katrina are being used to rebuild the system expected to 
protect the &ldquo;new&rdquo; New Orleans from future peril.</p>

<h2>Kids Rethink New Orleans Schools is Hiring</h2> 
<p>Two part-time facilitators for Rethink Clubs during the 2011-2012 academic 
year. Please see the job description below and help us spread the word about 
this fantastic opportunity!</p> 
<p><strong>Organization Description:</strong> Kids Rethink New Orleans Schools 
(Rethink) embodies an idea that is proving to be as dynamic as it is simple: 
give young people &ndash; even those as young as middle school &ndash; a voice 
in the reform of public education. Each year, approximately 100 youth work 
toward this vision by identifying areas for improvement within individual 
schools and the school system as a whole; developing innovative solutions; and 
acting to make their solutions a reality. Learn more on our website.</p> 
<p>&gt;<strong>Program Description:</strong> Rethink Clubs in six New Orleans 
schools challenge youth to think critically about and become engaged in the 
world they know best: their own school. Over the academic year, students 
designate an issue of concern, such as poor food, inadequate facilities or 
school security, and develop a platform for change. Our Club facilitators teach 
deep listening, public speaking and critical thinking. We include guest 
lectures from issue experts; visits from creative professionals including 
artists, poets, musicians and dancers; and field trips. Rethinkers from all six 
Clubs meet together at an annual summit where they share their visions for 
change. These videos were created by the Rethink Clubs at Langston Hughes

<p>Application for Amendment to<br>
<em>New Orleans 2030: Plan for the 21st 
Century (the Master Plan)</em></p> 
<p><strong>Complete Application Required:</strong> New Orleans 2030: Plan for 
the 21st Century (the Master Plan). The City will not process an application 
that does not have all the required items. To accept your application, each of 
the items listed on page 2 must be submitted at the same time.<em>For a copy of 
the application, please call the above number.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Early Consultation: </strong>Prior to submitting an application, 
the applicant is required to set up a pre-application conference meeting with a 
City Planner to discuss the proposal. City Planning staff will provide the 
applicant with assistance and information on the application feasibility, 
decision criteria, and review time.</p> 
<p><strong>Application Acceptance:</strong> All applicants are required to 
bring in one copy of the application package for informal review by a staff 
planner, prior to the formal application to ensure that the application is 
complete. Applications will be accepted at the City Planning Commission between 
8:00 AM and 6:00PM Monday through Friday. No appointment is necessary for the

<h2>RSD To Open Parent-Family Centers in New Orleans</h2> 
<p>NEW ORLEANS, La &ndash; On Tuesday, June 14, the Recovery School District 
will open Parent-Family Resource Centers at four locations around the city of 
New Orleans. Open year-round, these centers will provide services, such as 
student enrollment information, student record retrieval, and up-to-date data 
on all public schools in the city to help parents make informed decisions when 
seeking the best schools for their children.</p> 
<p>By providing these services and resources at locations more convenient and 
accessible to parents, the district hopes to meet the needs of parents and 
students more efficiently and effectively.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Parents and community members deserve clear information about their 
schools and their choices,&rdquo; RSD Superintendent John White said. 
&ldquo;Parent centers will bring clear information to communities throughout 
New Orleans.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The Parent-Family Resource Centers will be at the following locations:</p>

 Walter L. Cohen High 
School, 3520 Dryades St.<br>
 *<br>
 George W. Carver Elementary School, 3059 
Higgins Blvd.</p> 
<p>From 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, each center will provide 
the following services:</p> 
<p> *<br>
 Student enrollment information<br>

<p>More locations and services, such as centralized enrollment and 
transportation systems, will be added in coming months, according to 
Superintendent White. &ldquo;This is just a start, and there might be some 
hiccups along the way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want perfect 
to get in the way of doing good.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Over the next few weeks, the RSD wants to hear from parents and families 
who have utilized the Resource Centers to ensure that the centers are meeting 
their needs. Feedback may be sent to Sabrina D. Marsh-Sanders, Executive

<h2>Drip: The Music of Water in New Orleans</h2> 
<p><strong>At the CAC First Floor Sound Chamber</strong><br>
 Opening 
Reception: June 25, 2011, 6 &ndash; 8pm</p> 
<p><em>Drip: The Music of Water in New Orleans</em> is a sound installation 
created by John Kleinschmidt and Andy Sternad, intern architects at Waggonner 
&amp; Ball. They became interested in making Drip while participating in 
Waggonner &amp; Ball&rsquo;s Dutch Dialogues initiative to develop better water 
management strategies in New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta. The tracks for 
Drip were originally recorded for an installation presented as part of DesCours 
(an annual public art and architecture event in New Orleans) at the Union 
Passenger Terminal in 2010. The creators of Drip are architects by trade, and 
like many artists, they hold the belief that the health of a culture is 
dependent on the quality of its art. Combining a shared fascination of New 
Orleans musical culture with the certainty that the city&rsquo;s future rests 
on the development of a collective consciousness about water management, Drip 
was composed to heighten our awareness of water through sound.</p>

<h2>Project Home Again &mdash; Summer Internship</h2> 
<p>Project Home Again, a community development nonprofit in New Orleans, is 
seeking a summer intern to work on three community revitalization projects.</p> 
<p><strong>Organization Description</strong><br>
 Project Home Again is a 
small, private nonprofit organization that was created by the Leonard and 
Louise Riggio Foundation immediately after Hurricane Katrina to provide new 
homes for homeowners who had lost their homes in the flood. To date, the 
organization has built 70 handsome, energy-efficient homes throughout the 
Gentilly neighborhood. This summer, in addition to completing another 30 homes, 
the organization will be working on three distinct efforts: the Green Home 
Sustainability program, a grassroots anti-blight project, and homeowner 
selection. We are seeking a summer intern to assist with all three projects.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications</strong><br>
 The summer intern should have a 
diverse set of skills including a basic understanding of home construction, 
weatherization and energy-efficiency concepts, GIS mapping and spreadsheets, as 
well as the ability to quickly gain an understanding of and speak about the 
organization&rsquo;s homeowner selection process. The intern must be able to 
work in a small office with a handful of hardworking, but good-natured 
colleagues and handle projects independently as well as within a small team. We 
expect that 75% of the intern&rsquo;s time will be spent in the field and 25% 
in the office. The bulk of the job will entail performing energy efficiency 
assessments on single-family homes. Applicants should be able to climb ladders, 
perform exterior assessments in the summer heat of a semi-tropical environment, 
etc. The intern will work a 40-hour week with many of the assessments being 
performed on evenings and weekends. The intern must have his/her own means of 
transportation as public transportation is lacking in our neighborhood. A car 
or bicycle would suffice.</p> 
<p>Project Home Again is an equal opportunity employer that does not 
discriminate against people on the grounds of gender, race, religion, sexual 
orientation, disability or marital status.</p> 
<p><strong>Compensation</strong><br>
 The intern will be paid a weekly stipend 
of $500.</p>

<p>EAST LANSING, MI &ndash; 2,350 miles. That&rsquo;s the distance that 
Michigan State University graduates, Alex Poe and Cliff Walls, intend to travel 
this coming summer. And they&rsquo;ll be making this journey&hellip; by canoe. 
Departing in May from northern Minnesota, the duo will spend 2-3 months camping 
on riverbanks, avoiding perils of life on the water, and raising awareness for 
Friends of the Fishermen, an organization dedicated to assisting Louisiana 
fishermen affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Poe and Walls seek 
to raise at least $2,350 for the Friends of the Fishermen fund, representing 
one dollar for each mile paddled.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The oil spill still impacts many facets of coastal life, habitat, 
and industry, but maintaining the security of the people with the most need can 
have an important and enduring impact,&rdquo; said Poe. &ldquo;Friends of the 
Fishermen is a proven charity that is dedicated to achieving this.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>For Walls, a native of Flint and Social Relations/Environmental Economic 
senior, it was the sheer desire for adventure that inspired a trip of this 
magnitude. He discovered a shared love of outdoor activities with Poe, who will 
be attending Cornell Law in the fall. Walls and Poe are no strangers to 
adventure. In college, while most students spent their spring breaks lounging 
in tropical climates, Walls and Poe organized their friends to kayak, hike, and 
camp in a variety of locales. After sharing the dream of taking on the mighty 
Mississippi, it was with perfect timing and a little bit of luck that turned 
wishful thinking into a reality &mdash; and an opportunity to help some people 
in need along the way, donating financial proceeds to the New Orleans-based 
charity.</p> 
<p>About Friends of the Fishermen: The Friends of the Fishermen fund was 
started as a way to help the fishermen who were affected by the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill, more commonly known as the BP oil spill of 2010. The fund is 
endorsed by the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board and 
administrated by the South Central Planning and Development Commission, a 
501(c)(3) organization. To date, more than 30,000 families have been directly 
impacted by the oil spill, and it remains the largest in United States history.

groundbreaking national tour geared to promoting shelter pet adoptions &ndash; 
will arrive in New Orleans to partner with the Louisiana SPCA for a special 
mobile adoption event at Clearview Mall on Saturday, April 2 beginning at 11am.

<p>In partnership with PURINA ONE&reg;, Tour for Life is the world&rsquo;s

Animal League America &ndash; the world&rsquo;s largest no-kill animal rescue 
and adoption organization &ndash; eleven years ago and is responsible for 
placing thousands of pets into loving and permanent homes.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As a pet owner, I know the love that animals bring into our lives 
and homes,&rdquo; said country music legend and Tour for Life 2011 
spokesperson, Wynonna Judd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to participate in Tour for 
Life and want to encourage Americans across the country who are considering 
adding a pet to their families to visit their local shelter or stop by one of 
our events, and rescue a homeless pet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Nine local shelters and rescue groups will be participating in this 
adoption event: the LA/SPCA, PAWS, ARNO, Louisiana Boxer Rescue, Gulf Coast 
Doberman Rescue, the SULA Foundation, St. Francis Animal Sanctuary, St. Bernard

over 100 shelter and rescue groups to bring awareness to their organizations 
and find homes for orphaned pets in their care.</p>

<p>Bright flowers with sweet nectar will feed adult butterflies, but what 
about the caterpillars? Many butterflies and moths larvae feed only on specific

<p><strong><em>Collective Impact: Creating Large-Scale Social Change</em>
</strong><br>
 Stanford Social Innovation Review and FSG present a webinar.</p> 
<p>January 19, 2011, 2-3 PM EST<br>
Register Here</p> 
<p>The idea of &ldquo;collective impact&rdquo; or cross-sector collaboration 
to achieve large-scale social change is not entirely new; but what makes 
collective impact initiatives different? And, what makes collective impact work?
</p> 
<p>According to <em><strong>Stanford Social Innovation Review</strong></em> 
Collective Impact article authors John Kania and Mark Kramer, success in 
collective impact involves a coalescing of five specific conditions: a common 
agenda to solve a specific social problem, shared measurement systems, mutually 
reinforcing activities, continuous communication, and a &lsquo;backbone&rsquo; 
organization to coordinate the overall initiative. See John Kania&rsquo;s brief
video on collective impact.</p> 
<p>Join FSG&rsquo;s Kania and Kramer, Jeff Edmondson, executive director of the
<strong>Strive Partnership</strong> (a coalition of postsecondary, K-12, 
business, and nonprofit organizations) and moderator Eric Nee, managing editor 
at<em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em> for a lively webcast discussion, 
debate and Q&amp;A on how organizations can develop and implement collective 
impact initiatives, and why these initiatives can achieve far greater impact 
than the isolated efforts of single organizations.</p> 
<p>Register here for the <em>&ldquo;Collective Impact: Creating Large-Scale 
Social Change&rdquo;</em> webinar ($49.00). After the live webinar event, you 
may access the recorded presentation as often as desired. For additional 
information, please contactFSG (info@fsg.org).</p>

<p>New Orleans&rsquo; First Annual Latin Jazz Festival<br>
 Presented by Casa 
Borrega</p> 
<p>Casa Borrega, a soon-to-be Mexican Caf&eacute; and Latin Cultural Center, 
will debut New Orleans&rsquo; Latin Jazz Fest on the 5th Anniversary of 
Hurricane Katrina. The concert is the first of its kind to celebrate the 
rhythms so essential to our city. Deep roots connect the music of New Orleans 
with the sounds that have emanated from Cuba and other Spanish speaking 
nations. New Orleans&rsquo; cultural heritage is that much richer because of 
the Latin influence.</p> 
<p>This festival celebrates a people who have shaped our region in so many 
ways, yet have largely gone unrecognized. Twenty-five of New Orleans&rsquo; 
most prolific Latin Jazz artists will perform the melodic and danceable beats 
of their genre in honor of the significant contribution of Latino immigrants to 
the rebuilding of the city.</p> 
<p>This seminal four hour program is open to the public for a $10 donation. 
Imported beer, mojitos, tacos al pastor, tortas, tamales, and other Latin 
delicacies will be available.</p> 
<p>Special thanks to those organizations and individuals who have made the 
event possible: Zeitgeist Multidisciplinary Arts Center, Saturn Screen 
Printing, New Orleans Musicians Assistance Foundation, Global Green USA, 
Bernard Productions, Creative Industries, Fredy Omar Quiroz and Zachary 
Youngerman.</p>

<p>Proceeds will benefit Global Green, an organization whose leadership has 
been indispensable in rebuilding a green and sustainable city. The organization 
advocates for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and affordable green homes 
and schools.<br>
 Since the oil spill, Global Green has expanded its efforts to 
include wetlands restoration and assistance to impacted communities seeking 
green jobs and a brighter future.</p>

<p>Intended to jump-start the careers of 17-25 year-olds, this course will 
teach participants how to use a Content Management System to create digital 
media content. Used to power modern websites, web applications, eblast 
generators, and more, understanding how to structure content to fit into a 
Content Management System is a skill fundamental to many jobs today. In this 
case, we will be utilizing those skills towards developing iPhone applications

<p>Our showcase is going to be called &ldquo;Beats for the Bayou&rdquo; and it 
is to take place on Wednesday, November 3rd, 2010 in the Student Union Theater

admission is FREE. We are accepting and encouraging donations to the Gulf Coast

<p>Dear friends and colleagues,</p> 
<p>Three crises-Hurricane Katrina, the Great Recession, and the Gulf oil 
spill-in five years. That&rsquo;s a lot.</p> 
<p>One year ago, the Data Center and Brookings embarked on an ambitious 
project-to comprehensively assess not only our recovery progress at the fifth 
anniversary of Katrina, but whether or not we are bouncing back better than 
before. and to create a baseline that helps answer the question, &ldquo;Where 
do we go from here?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Along the way we made some important discoveries. The evidence reveals some 
positive trends. For example, wages and entrepreneurship have spiked 
post-Katrina, school quality has improved, and household incomes have increased 
(in contrast to the nation where they have fallen). And perhaps more 
importantly, there is more social cohesion in New Orleans, and we&rsquo;ve 
gained community competence and problem solving skills that have helped us to 
take on major reforms. In fact, we have arguably taken on more major reforms 
simultaneously than any modern American city.</p> 
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to need all these newfound competencies, because the 
evidence also reveals some pretty disturbing trends-like stark disparities in 
incomes between racial and ethnic groups, more impoverished folks in the 
suburbs than in the city, and lagging industries such that we now have fewer 
jobs in our economy than we did back in 1980. And this is not even mentioning 
our high crime rates and the rate at which our wetlands are disappearing.</p> 
<p>Much work lies ahead as we strive to build a stronger economy, better 
opportunities for all, and a greener, more sustainable future.</p> 
<p>And then. the oil spill.</p> 
<p>The question has become even more poignant. &ldquo;Where do we go from here?
</p> 
<p>Today, with the help of 11 local experts systematically documenting seven 
major post-Katrina reforms, 20 indicators stretching back to 1980, feedback 
from dozens of community leaders, and countless hours of Brookings&rsquo; 
expertise on resilience, federal policy, economic development and more, we 
bring you&hellip;</p> 
<p>The New Orleans Index at Five.</p>

data trends analysis, seven full essays on major post-Katrina reforms, and two 
background papers on the New Orleans economy athttp://www.gnocdc.org</p>

<p>Volunteer with Global Green&rsquo;s Ambassador Corps</p> 
<p>What is the Ambassador Corps?</p> 
<p>The Ambassador Corps allows individuals to help create a more sustainable 
New Orleans through volunteer opportunities with Global Green USA. One can 
become a member by participating in the next training at the Holy Cross Project 
Visitor Center:</p> 
<p>Ambassador Corps Training<br>
 2 pm to 4 pm<br>
 SATURDAY, JUNE 5th<br>
 
409 Andry Street, New Orleans</p> 
<p>What will I do as a member of the Ambassador Corps?</p> 
<p>A member of the Ambassador Corps has four potential ways to volunteer with 
Global Green:</p> 
<p>Digital-Volunteer<br>
 A digital-volunteer is an individual that can help 
Global Green via computer and/or phone. A digital-volunteer typically 
volunteers their own talents to Global Green. Training is minimal.</p> 
<p>Participate in Tabling and Outreach Events<br>
 Global Green has several 
events that involve reaching out to the community. Volunteers will speak with 
the attendees about the services that BIBG provides (energy consults and green 
building advice) as well as answer any questions they may have about Global 
Green USA.</p> 
<p>Participate in Home Weatherizations<br>
 Weatherization is the modification 
of a building to reduce energy consumption, thus reducing utility bills. 
Ambassador Corps members have the opportunity to help participate in the 
hands-on weatherization.</p> 
<p>Docent at the Holy Cross Project Visitor Center<br>
 Global Green&rsquo;s 
Holy Cross Project Visitor Center is a LEED Platinum home (the highest level of 
this green building standard). It is open every Monday, Friday, and Saturday 
for tours. An Ambassador Corps member can serve as a docent (tour-guide) for 
the Visitor Center after shadowing a fellow docent a few times before taking 
the lead on tours.</p>

<p>With all eyes on the disaster in the Gulf, we must not lose sight of a 
longer-running tragedy affecting us all, every day: the unconscionable number 
of New Orleanians who are undereducated and unemployable.</p> 
<p>This very human disaster lies at our feet and at the root of our 
city&rsquo;s toughest challenges &mdash; drugs, crime, high incarceration 
rates, and broken social services. Yet while the situation is tragic, it is not 
hopeless. You can solve it.</p> 
<p>The Early Childhood &amp; Family Learning Foundation&rsquo;s new Mahalia 
Jackson Center in Central City gives New Orleans&rsquo; poorest children a leg 
up during the critical first five years of their life, when it is needed most. 
The center provides comprehensive educational, mental, physical, and social 
services, so that kids have a real chance to succeed in school, graduate, and

parents (many just children themselves) helping them to do the same.</p> 
<p>The upcoming concert &ldquo;From Symphony to Jazz to Kids&rdquo; on October 
27, 2010 from<br>
 7 to 9 pm at the Mahalia Jackson Theater will raise funds 
supporting the foundation&rsquo;s work. By sponsoring the concert at $1,000 or 
more, you also allow an enrolled child and two of his/her family members to 
attend the event, featuring the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, Ellis 
Marsalis, Ronnie Cole, tributes to Pete Fountain and Fats Domino, and more.</p> 
<p>Now is the time to act. The Mahalia Jackson Center is only the first of 
others planned throughout New Orleans and could be our last chance to recover 
from this human disaster. If you are ready to help our children succeed &mdash; 
give today. Give if you are finished living with failure. Give if you believe 
in our children and in our city. Give if you are ready to make a real 
difference.</p>

<p>The Gulf Catastrophe could have been avoided if the US were growing algae. 
Algae is renewable, does not affect the food channel and consumes CO2. No 
explosions, no fires, no deaths and no environmental problems. What&rsquo;s 
wrong with that???</p> 
<p>Algae has been researched in US universities for over 35 years. It&rsquo;s 
time to move it out of the lab and go into commercial-scale production. 
Algaepreneurs are starting to build commercial-scale plants throughout the US 
using all off-the-shelf existing technologies. More algae production plants are 
coming online. Algae is one solution to get the US off of foreign oil and 
create new jobs right here in the US. The algae industry is being built today 
by Americans who all want to get off foreign oil.</p> 
<p>To learn more about the fast-track commercialization of the industry, you 
may want to check out the National Algae Association.

<p>Dear friends in the non-profit field, </p> 
<p>ASI recently upgraded the copiers and fax machines at some of our branches. 
Instead of throwing them away I want to find a non-profit to donate them to. 
Neither the faxes nor the copiers would be appropriate for a big fancy 
non-profit that you guys work for. But they would be perfect for a small 
non-profit that might be on a limited budget. Can you reach for your rolodexes 
and see if any of your partners, affiliates, or perhaps an underfunded program 
could use a fax and/or a copier?</p> 
<p>The details: </p> 
<p>The desktop copiers are what I would all &ldquo;industrial strength,&rdquo; 
in that they are literally desktop versions of a stand alone file room type 
copier. They have fewer pages per minute, however, than those bigger machines. 
They are about 7-10 years old but they work pretty well, most of the time. I 
have some toner that I can send with them, but not a lot. Replacement toner is 
easily purchased online for around $40.</p> 
<p>The fax machines are little $80 numbers that we buy from office depot. ASII 
people might remember them as the fax they are forced to use. They&rsquo;re 
good for &ldquo;light use.&rdquo; Hey a fax is a fax, right? They take a fax 
film roll that can also be purchased online easily for about $15.</p> 
<p>We have about 6 of each, so please pass the word! </p> 
<p>If you know a nonprofit that might be interested in a free copier and/or 
fax machine please let me know by Wednesday May 19. I can arrange for delivery 
if necessary.</p>

<p>Volunteering just doesn&rsquo;t get any easier than this!</p> 
<p>After 5 years as a visitor, One Brick is looking to make New Orleans home!
</p> 
<p>One Brick provides support to local non-profit and community organizations 
by creating a unique, social and flexible volunteer environment for those 
interested in making a concrete difference in the community. We enable people 
to get involved, have an impact and have fun, without the requirements of 
individual long-term commitments. (Details:http://www.onebrick.org/about)</p> 
<p>We have a lot to offer the good people of New Orleans. But we will need 
your guidance and help getting the ball rolling. Please join us for an 
informational/getting organized meeting on Tuesday May 4th at 7pm. We will meet 
on the balcony of Borders Bookstore on St Charles Ave</p> 
<p>If you have any questions please feel free to email us at nola@onebrick.org
</p> 
<p>About One Brick</p> 
<p>Headquartered in San Francisco, California, One Brick is a 501(c)3 
non-profit organization that brings volunteers together to support other local 
non-profits by adopting an innovative twist to the volunteer experience: we 
create a friendly and social atmosphere around volunteering, and after each 
volunteer event &mdash; which typically lasts only 3 to 4 hours &mdash; we 
invite volunteers to gather at a local restaurant or caf&eacute; where they can 
get to know one another in a relaxed social setting. Our &lsquo;commitment-free 
volunteering&rsquo; allows you to choose when you volunteer, rather than having 
to make commitments for a certain number of volunteer hours, or agree to be 
available every week at a specific time.<br>
 The Volunteer-Run Volunteer 
Organization</p> 
<p>Perhaps the most unique component to One Brick&rsquo;s approach is that 
each chapter within the organization is run entirely by volunteers! One Brick 
does not have a physical office, or even a telephone. In fact, on a National 
level, we only have a single part-time employee who worksfrom home and is 
responsible for paying the bills, dealing with legal and regulatory filings and 
ensuring the wholething stays together. Everything else we do is facilitated by 
a team of volunteers working together to make a difference. Their efforts are 
returned exponentially with the impact wehave on our communities. And yes, 
there&rsquo;s always room for more people to join the team!</p>

at the regional competition in Houston, Texas &ndash; and they won! Now 
they&rsquo;re off to Washington, DC for the national-level competition.</p> 
<p>CEFPI is giving partial support for the travels, but the Rethinkers are 
still in great need of monetary support to cover food and travel expenses to 
get to DC.</p> 
<p>Please join us this Thursday at the AIA Center for Design. The Rethinkers

<p>&ldquo;No one can find what will work for our cities by<br>
 looking at 
suburban garden cities, manipulating<br>
 scale models, or inventing dream 
cities.<br>
 You&rsquo;ve got to get out and walk.&rdquo;<br>
 - Jane Jacobs, 
writer &amp; urban visionary</p> 
<p>Jane&rsquo;s Walk is a series of free neighborhood walking tours that help 
put people in touch with their environment and with each other, by bridging 
social and geographic gaps and creating a space for cities to discover 
themselves. Since its start in 2007, Jane&rsquo;s Walk has happened in cities 
across North America, and is growing internationally.</p> 
<p>Jane&rsquo;s Walk honors the legacy and ideas of urban activist and writer 
Jane Jacobs who championed the interests of local residents and pedestrians 
over a car-centered approach to planning. Jane&rsquo;s Walk helps knit people 
together into a strong and resourceful community, instilling belonging and 
encouraging civic leadership.</p> 
<p>All Jane&rsquo;s Walk tours are given and taken for free. They are led by 
anyone who has an interest in the neighborhood where they live, work or hang 
out. They are not only about architecture and heritage, but also offer a 
personal take on the local culture, the social history and the planning issues 
faced by the residents. Jane Jacobs believed strongly that local residents 
understood best how their neighborhood works, and what is needed to strengthen 
and improve them. Jane&rsquo;s Walks are fun, engaging and participatory 
&ndash; everyone&rsquo;s got a story and they&rsquo;re usually keen to share it.
</p> 
<p>We would love to see YOU host a Jane&rsquo;s Walk in your Greater New 
Orleans neighborhood?</p>

<p>Roberta Gratz is an award-winning journalist and urban critic, lecturer and 
author of the just released: &ldquo;The Battle For Gotham: New York in the 
Shadow of Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In the 1970s, New York City hit rock bottom. Crime was at its highest, the 
middle class exodus was in high gear, and bankruptcy loomed. Many people credit 
New York&rsquo;s master builder Robert Moses with turning Gotham around, 
despite his brutal, undemocratic. and demolition-heavy ways.</p> 
<p>Urban critic and journalist Roberta Brandes Gratz contradicts this 
conventional view. New York City, Gratz argues, recovered precisely because of 
the waning power of Moses. His decline in the late 1960s and the drying up of 
big government funding for urban renewal projects allowed New York to 
organically regenerate according to the precepts defined by Jane Jacobs in her 
classic, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, and in contradiction to 
Moses&rsquo;s urban philosophy.</p> 
<p>As American cities face a devastating economic crisis, Jacobs&rsquo;s 
philosophy is again vital for the redevelopment of metropolitan life. Gratz who 
was named as one of Planetizen&rsquo;s Top 100 Urban Thinkers gives an 
on-the-ground account of urban renewal and community success.</p>

<p>If you are relentless about seeing disadvantaged students achieve at high 
levels, this is a chance to build a school that does whatever it takes to 
ensure college success for all children. Moreover, your work would make a 
profound and lasting contribution to the post-Katrina revitalization of New 
Orleans.</p> 
<p>New Orleans College Prep (NOCP) is a public, open enrollment, charter 
school for underserved children from across Orleans Parish. Currently in its 
3rd year of operation, NOCP serves a population of 440 students&ndash; 300 
students in grade 6-8 and 140 students in grades K-2. NOCP is growing 
aggressively every year until we serve students in grades K-12, and plans to 
open additional K-12 campuses throughout the city until reaching full scale of 
8-10 schools with total enrollment over 4,000 students.</p> 
<p>Our mission is to prepare each of our students to enter and excel in a 
rigorous 4-year college or university. In contrast to low-performing public 
schools that fail to focus on results, NOCP utilizes an extended school day and 
year, a disciplined and nurturing school culture, and data-driven instruction 
to drive dramatic gains in student achievement. New Orleans College Prep will 
provide ALL our students with a sound college preparatory education that rivals 
the academic rigor of the best private and public schools in the city.</p> 
<p>We offer a competitive compensation package, including a salary 10-15% 
above the local district scale, an opportunity to earn an annual performance 
bonus, and comprehensive health benefits.</p>

<p>Many times over the past five years, the citizens of New Orleans have 
proven that we have the spirit and determination it takes to rebuild this City. 
Yet the biggest determinant of the resources we will have to tackle the 
challenges of the next decade occurs over the next three weeks: the decennial 
U.S. Census.</p> 
<p>For the past two years, the City of New Orleans (with the help of the 
Greater New Orleans Community Data Center) has successfully challenged the 
annual census estimates, resulting in a 75,000 person adjustment to the 
City&rsquo;s population. In turn, this readjustment has resulted in millions of 
federal funds &ndash; based on a population formula &ndash; flowing to the City.
<b>THE 2010 CENSUS CANNOT BE CHALLENGED</b>. If we do not count every person 
who calls New Orleans home by April 1 of this year, we lose over $3,000 per 
person.</p> 
<p>Please read the message below, fill out the census form hanging on your 
door, and tell your friends, family, neighbors, and colleagues:<b>STAND UP AND 
BE COUNTED!</b></p>

<h3>New RSVP Funding Will Expand Program To New Communities </h3> 
<p>Washington, DC&mdash;The Corporation for National and Community Service 
issued a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) today that will provide grant 
funding to launch new RSVP projects &ndash; service projects that recruit 
volunteers ages 55 and over &ndash; in communities not served and expand 
existing service programs.</p> 
<p>These funds increase service opportunities for older Americans to help 
address the challenges facing communities across the nation,&rdquo; said Nicola 
Goren, the Corporation&rsquo;s Acting CEO.</p> 
<p>The RSVP NOFA totals $2.7 million in new funding that will be made 
available through a national competition to grow the number of RSVP volunteers 
through a combination of new grants in communities not served by RSVP 
volunteers and an expansion of existing grants. In Fiscal 2009, RSVP volunteers 
mentored more than 103,000 children and youth, provided a range of independent 
living services for more than 600,000 frail seniors, and recruited and 
coordinated nearly 44,000 community volunteers.</p> 
<p>This grant competition will build on the successes of the RSVP programs by 
placing a priority on projects that enable volunteers to:</p> 
<p>&bull; Assist individuals, including frail seniors and veterans of recent 
conflicts, with independent living support, including respite for family or 
informal caregivers;</p> 
<p>&bull; Assist children academically so they will success in school; and </p>
<p>&bull; Assist individuals, including frail seniors and other vulnerable 
populations, with home energy efficiency, such as weatherization and energy 
audits.</p> 
<p>All applicants must describe how they will place 20% of their volunteers in 
assignments that enhance organizational capacity in the community, such as pro 
bono planning support, recruiting and coordinating community volunteers, or 
assisting with resource development.</p> 
<p>Submission of a Concept Paper is required. Applicants submitting successful 
Concept Papers will be invited to submit full applications. The Concept Paper 
deadline is February 22, 2010, 5:00 EST. The deadline for applications is 5 
p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, April 6, 2010. Successful applicants will be 
notified by August 20. Click here to read the entire NOFA, and for further 
information, emailPNS@cns.gov or call 202.606.3225. Applications should be 
submitted tohttps://egrants.cns.gov/espan/main/login.jsp. </p> 
<p>RSVP is one of three Corporation programs operated by Senior Corps, which 
taps the skills, talents, and experience of nearly 500,000 Americans age 55 and 
over to meet a wide range of community challenges. The other programs are the 
Foster Grandparent Program and the Senior Companion Program.</p> 
<p>The Corporation for National and Community Service is a federal agency that 
engages more than five million Americans in service each year through its core 
programs, Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and Learn and Serve America, and leads 
President Obama&rsquo;s national call to service initiative, United We Serve.

<p>STAIR (Start The Adventure In Reading), a nonprofit children&rsquo;s 
literacy program is seeking tutors for the fall 2009 semester. Tutor training 
begins Wednesday, September 16 through Thursday, October 22 at locations around 
the greater New Orleans area. Training takes only two hours and no experience 
is necessary. Tutors volunteer after school or on Saturday mornings at STAIR 
sites in Orleans, Jefferson and Plaquemines parishes.</p> 
<p>Each year STAIR recruits and trains hundreds of volunteers to work 
one-on-one with public school second graders to improve their reading and 
language skills as well as their self-esteem. These students are particularly 
in danger of academic failure and need extra help to succeed. The program works 
in partnership with schools to supplement the classroom work. Collaboration 
with parents, teachers, and principals allows STAIR to target the students who 
can most benefit from the services STAIR offers. The program has served over 
5,000 young students from greater New Orleans public schools since it began in 
1985.</p> 
<p>The STAIR program provides each child with professionally-designed 
curriculum materials, school supplies, teaching aids, healthy snacks, and 
trained site directors to supervise and lend qualified help at each site. STAIR 
depends on support from the community to provide this service at no cost to the 
students.</p>

<p>Hello. I am working on a new program for New Orleans youth and am in the 
beginning stages of planning. I am new to the process of writing grants. 
I&rsquo;ve learned the basics&ndash;follow the guidelines, answer all the 
questions proposed and get to the point. I&rsquo;ve thought of taking a course 
at the local colleges but can anyone suggest any other resources that might 
help me learn? I&rsquo;ve heard people also say you just have to start writing 
them!<br>
 I&rsquo;m a first time visitor of the GNOF website and I&rsquo;ve 
learned a lot so far. THANKS!!<br>
<em><br>
<strong>A Note from the Foundation:
</strong> Do you know about the grantwriting courses offered by the Louisiana 
Association of Nonprofit Organizations? They&rsquo;re a great resource for that 
kind of training.</em></p>
