<h2>  Language Learning &amp; Travel Julia Pimsleur Levine </h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>  Written By Holly Rosen Fink  Tuesday, November 16, 2010 01:01 </p> 
Pimsleur, Language Learning, Paul Pimsleur, Julia Pimsleur Levine <br>
<br>
<br>
Julia Pimsleur Levine is the President of the Little Pim Corporation, which 
produces and distributes the<em>Little Pim: Fun with Languages</em> series to 
introduce young children to a second language. I recently asked Julia a few 
questions about her products and how they can help make travel time easier for 
Traveling Moms.&nbsp; She also suggested some games for kids to play while 
traveling that incorporate language learning.
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> Please tell us how your products 
can help make travel time easier for parents.</p> 
<p><strong>Pimsleur:</strong> Little Pim foreign language DVDs provide 
educational entertainment for your kids during travel times, and they will 
amaze you with how many words they can learn in Spanish, French or Chinese in 
one plane or car ride! Our &ldquo;vocabulary booster apps&rdquo; are also very 
easy to use and affordable ($1.99 each) even for kids as young as two, and 
reinforce the words taught in the DVD series. The flash cards provide a great 
activity for parents and kids to do together while on the go, and the parents 
do not need to speak the language themselves, as all our products come with 
easy to use phonetic guides.</p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> What is the value of teaching a 
foreign language to our children?</p> 
<p><strong>Pimsleur</strong>: There is a more of a need than ever for our 
children to learn two languages, not only for the social and cultural benefits, 
but to become active citizens of our increasingly global economy.&nbsp; 
Proficiency in foreign languages and an understanding of other cultures used to 
be a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; but have really become essential skills in the 
twenty-first century. &nbsp;If they start learning young, they will have better 
accents, learn new vocabulary with ease, and jump start a life-long interest in 
language learning.&nbsp; Children who can speak another language will have 
their pick of the best jobs when they grow up, and will be at ease living and 
working in more than one country.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> What is the Pimsleur approach and 
how does it differ from other language-learning products? Why is the best one 
for children?</p> 
<p><strong>Pimsleur:</strong> My father, Dr. Paul Pimsleur, created the 
Pimsleur Method, which is an audio only method that allows adults to get 
conversational quickly in a foreign language. I grew up in the language 
teaching business and was inspired by my father&rsquo;s method to create a 
children&rsquo;s version that introduces kids to a second language at the age 
they learn best, which is before the age of six. Our Little Pim DVDs use the 
&ldquo;Entertainment Immersion Method&rdquo;, which allows even very young 
children to start learning and speaking a second language via total immersion 
(with optional English subtitles for their grown ups). The method is a mix of 
real kids doing everyday activities, and Little Pim the Panda, the teacher, 
introducing and repeating simple words and phrases. Each 3-DVD set teaches 360 
words and phrases, and the kids are exposed to native speakers with perfect 
accents.</p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> When should a parent start teaching 
their children foreign languages?<br>
<strong><br>
Pimsleur:</strong> The 
earlier you start the better. It&rsquo;s never too young to start introducing 
your child to a second language and it will not interfere with their English 
language learning. Babies and toddlers can listen to CDs and books and as they 
get older, you can introduce DVDs and interactive games.</p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> How can a child have fun and learn 
a foreign language at the same time?</p> 
<p><strong>Pimsleur:</strong> Little Pim the panda makes language learning 
fun. Kids love watching his adventures and want to watch him over and over 
again. When they watch, and repeat after Little Pim, they learn. We know no 
child is going to tug on her mom&rsquo;s pant leg and say &ldquo;I want to 
learn Mandarin Chinese!&rdquo; but she will say &ldquo;I want to watch the 
panda!&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> What are some games that you can 
suggest for kids to play while traveling that incorporate language learning?<br>
<br><strong>Pimsleur:</strong></p> 
<p>1) Play a game where every child gets a point for naming an object you see 
out the window in another language. Whoever gets the most points gets a treat 
at the next rest stop or upon arrival. You can help out by naming objects the 
first time (a tree = &ldquo;un arbre&rdquo; or a car = &ldquo;une 
voiture&rdquo;) and your kids can call them out the next time.</p> 
<p>2) Print out the Little Pim coloring pages from our web site and have kids 
color them in the back seat (you&rsquo;ll need crayons and a lap desk or a hard 
cover book to lean). Each coloring page teaches a new word or phrase. Go toGAMES
 on the web site and print out up to 10 pictures of Little Pim to color in, 
with vocabulary included.</p> 
<p>3) Play music in a foreign language and encourage your kids to sing along
</p> 
<p>4) Bring flash cards and award prizes for the child who gets the most 
right, or with one child, a small treat if they can get 5 right in a row.</p> 
<p>5)<strong> </strong>Get &ldquo;countable&rdquo; snacks<strong> </strong>
(like peanuts, grapes or raisins)<strong> </strong>and count off in the foreign 
language. See how high you can get before forgetting how to say it! The winner 
gets their pick of snacks to eat.</p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> Are any of your products useful for 
kids to use on a trip?</p> 
<p><strong>Pimsleur: </strong>The digital downloads are very convenient to 
bring on a trip, as are the flash cards (which come in a sturdy box that is 
great for on the go). If you are traveling with a DVD player, bring along the 
DVDs. The apps are a great go-to game if you have an iTouch, iPhone or iPad 
(search &ldquo;Word Bag&rdquo; or &ldquo;Talking Coloring Book&rdquo; in 
iTunes).</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom</strong><strong>:</strong> When a family is 
traveling in a country where English is not the native language, what is the 
best way to get the kids immersed and interested in that language?</p> 
<p><strong>Pimsleur: </strong>A few weeks before your trip, start introducing 
the language of the country you&rsquo;ll be visiting by playing CDs and DVDs 
and reading your children books that expose them to the culture of the country. 
If you can, set aside a special time to learn with them (such as &ldquo;Italian 
breakfast every Wednesday&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spanish at bath time&rdquo;) as then 
kids will be able to know when to switch into that learning mode and you will 
also have a set time to bring these materials to their attention. Above all, 
try to make it fun! No vocabulary drills or memorization &ndash; just try to 
teach them a few simple words and phrases and show them what you love about the 
place you are visiting (the food, the music, the traditions, etc). They will 
have an even better time when they get there if they know a bit of what to 
expect and can speak a few words to make their needs known. They will pick up 
much more vocabulary when they are there, so no need to make that a chore 
before you go.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Culture Traveling Mom:</strong> Does Pimsleur offer any 
downloadables or online material for kids to take on a trip?<br>
<br>
<strong>
Pimsleur:</strong> We offer all our DVDs as digital downloads (35 minutes per 
DVD) that play on any computers or handheld devices such as the iPhone, iTouch, 
or iPad. They cost $14.95 per 35 minute DVD or a reduced price of $41.95 for 
three DVDs. Free downloadable coloring pages can be found under GAMES on our 
web site.</p>  Related Articles/Posts
