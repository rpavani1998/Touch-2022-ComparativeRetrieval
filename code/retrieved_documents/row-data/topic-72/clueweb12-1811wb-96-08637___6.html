<h3> A Deeper Look into the Magic Kingdom </h3>  Saturday, February 27, 2010  
Here in Pennsylvania we've been hit by snowstorm after snowstorm. Some people 
have asked me if I wish I were in Disney World right now. Well, of course I 
ALWAYS wish I were in Disney World (most seconds of the day) but honestly, 
there is no way I would want to be in the Happiest Place on Earth and then come 
home to snow and cold temperatures! I am looking forward to being there in 
April/May. The flowers and shrubbery are so stunning that time of year!<br>

 There are so many places that we visit every time 
we go to WDW that we become used to seeing them and then one day they just POP 
out at us! Here is a perfect example, the Liberty Tree:<br>

<blockquote> The plaque under the tree reads: <br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Under the 
roughs of the original Liberty Tree in Boston in 1765, patriots, calling 
themselves &ldquo;The Sons of Liberty,&rdquo; gathered to protest the 
imposition of the Stamp Act. In the years that followed, almost every American 
town had a Liberty Tree &ndash; a living symbol of the American freedom of 
speech and assembly. Our Liberty Tree is a Southern Live Oak, Quercus 
Virginiana, more than 100 years old.&rdquo;</blockquote> Share | <br>

<h3> Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe </h3>  Wednesday, February 24, 2010  Last 
trip we spent a lot of time in Tomorrowland; between the Buzz Lightyear ride 
and the Speedway, it felt like we practically lived in that area!Cosmic Ray's 
Starlight Cafe is in Tomorrowland, it's a quick service restaurant so we 
decided to grab lunch there one day. It was the best decision we ever made!<br>

<br> <br>

<br>
 When we were there last year we 
decided to eat outside, it was pretty crowded inside, but now I know why...THE 
FOOD! There is something for everyone at Ray's and I mean EVERYONE! Soups, 
salads, sandwiches, chicken, BBQ chicken, burgers and yummy desserts.<br>
<br>

View Full Menu <br>
<br>
 The inside of the restaurant is designed like the 
lobby of a spaceship and is separated into 3 different ordering sections:<br>

<ul> 
<li>Bay 1 - BBQ Chicken and Ribs </li> 
<li>Bay 2 - Hot Dogs and Burgers </li> 
<li>Bay 3 - Double Cheese Burgers and Salads</li> </ul>While this is a nice 
idea, it's kind of a pain when everyone in your party wants something different 
because you then have to get in different lines. There is limited seating 
inside as well. Those are my only 2 'complaints' because really it was an 
awesome experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Let's not forget Sonny Eclipse, the 
animatronic lounge singer. We did not get a chance to be entertained by Sonny 
since we ate outside but hey, maybe this year ;) Share | <br>

<h3> Is the Disney Dining Plan Worth It - Part 2 </h3>  Sunday, February 21, 
2010 <br>
<br>
 In 2008 we used the basic dining plan and we were disappointed 
with it. You can read about that here:Is the Disney Dining Plan Worth It? Even 
though we didn't like the way it worked out, because I am lazy I just went 
ahead and planned for it again for our2009 trip. It was just easier to pay a 
flat rate for food and be done with it. In the end though, we still paid extra 
money,<i>again</i>. <br>
<br>
 In 2009 appetizers still were not part of the 
basic dining plan, nor was gratuity so for just about every meal we paid 
something out of pocket. The plan did allow for a dessert for each table 
service. You know what would be cool? If you could swap appetizers for 
desserts. We don't usually want a dessert with every table service but 
sometimes like to have appetizers. Oh well, I suppose it wouldn't be worth it 
to Disney as I am sure an appetizer probably cost more than a dessert.<br>
<br>

 This year, I see the basic plan includes appetizers - for CHILDREN ages 3-9. 
What the heck?<br>
<br>
<b>1 Table-Service Meal</b> <br>
<i>Each table-service 
meal includes:</i> <br>
<br>
 * 1 appetizer ( <b>Guests ages 3-9 only</b>) <br>

 * 1 entr&eacute;e<br>
 * 1 dessert (lunch and dinner only) <br>
 * 1 juice 
(breakfast only)<br>
 * 1 single-serving, non-alcoholic beverage <br>
<br>
 Or 
<br> <br>
 * 1 full buffet <br>
<br>
<b>1 Quick-Service Meal</b> <br>
<i>Each 
quick-service meal includes:</i> <br>
<br>
 * 1 entr&eacute;e <br>
 * 1 dessert 
(lunch and dinner only)<br>
 * 1 juice (breakfast only) <br>
 * 1 
single-serving, non-alcoholic beverage<br>
<br>
<b>1 Snack</b> <br>
<br>
 So 
what's with appetizers for kids only? Now, I am talking about the basic plan 
because that is what we used. (I realize the deluxe plan does include an 
appetizer for adults.)<br>
<br>
 The price for 2010, basic dining plan varies 
by season; $41.99 or $46.99 per night per adult, $11.99 or $12.99 per night per 
child, depending on the time of year. You'd THINK that's a good deal. Heck, $42 
a day for 1 meal, 1 quick service and 1 snack and you get 1 Resort-Refillable 
Drink Mug Per Person. The problem? Well for us, we felt compelled to have a sit 
down meal every day, to get our money's worth. If you've ever been to Disney 
you know that it's tough to plan days around meals and it's sometimes easier to 
just grab a burger or a sandwich at a quick service place.<br>
<br>
<b>The 
Cons:&nbsp;</b> <br>

<ul> 
<li>not much flexibility</li> 
<li> you get what&rsquo;s included, with<b> no substitutions</b> - We really 
didn&rsquo;t want two desserts each day (one with our quick service lunch and 
one with our table service dinner). In fact, we typically don't want dessert at 
all. We ordered them because they came with the meal and we paid for them but 
we prefer appetizers, which aren&rsquo;t included.</li> 
<li>you <b>can&rsquo;t &ldquo;carry over&rdquo; unused portions of a meal 
credit</b> &ndash; you can&rsquo;t get the entr&eacute;e and drink at a quick 
service restaurant, then get the dessert later at a different restaurant.&nbsp;
</li> 
<li>can be stressful because you can find yourself planning your vacation 
around meals.</li> </ul> <b>The Pros:</b> <br>

<ul> 
<li>paying ahead makes things easy - you don't have to worry bout the price of 
your meal. If you eat at an upscale restaurant, you can order the $30 
entr&eacute;e without concern.</li> </ul>In a nutshell, it depends on your 
style of eating. Normally we like a big breakfast and then just graze during 
the day, we don't even necessarily need a quick service meal (or a 'lunch') 
during the day. We sometimes like a nice dinner to finish off the day but then 
again, depending on our plans for the day, dinner might just be a burger and 
fries, topped off with some ice cream!<br>
<br>
2010 Dining Plan <br>
<br>
 
This year we won't be using the dining plan. This is due not only to past 
experience but also to us now being DVC members. We plan on having breakfasts 
in the villa and we will also have plenty of snacks with us as well.<br>
<br>

<h3> Disney Vacation in April and May </h3>  Saturday, February 20, 2010  Back 
in March of 2009 I posted about theBest Time to Visit Disney World and well, 
here it is almost a year later and my opinion has not changed. Now, we are 
going to be visiting in October this year so maybe I will change my mind?<br>

<br> I live in Pennsylvania so by the time April rolls around I am so ready to 
be somewhere warm. We've hadhorrible snow storms this month and well, while 
you'd think this is when I would want to go to Florida and enjoy the sunshine I 
gotta tell ya, I would NOT want to come home to snow!<br>
<br>

 The above picture is of the beach at the Polynesian Resort. The 
Poly, as it is affectionately called, is a wonderful deluxe resort and the 
place we have always stayed.<br>
<br>
 Our 'standard' Disney vacation time 
frame is somewhere between the last week of April and the 3rd week of May. This 
time is perfect, to us at least, because it's after all the Spring Break 
hoopla, after Easter Break and before Memorial Day weekend. Seems like a lull - 
a time in-between when most people visit.<br>
<br>
 Personally, I LOVE this 
time of year. The weather is perfect. Warm but not HOT, very little rain and 
perfect sleeping temperatures! Of course, this is just my opinion.Last year by 
the time we had to head home the temperature was already starting to reach the 
mid-90's, so yea, that was reaching HOT status for me. Also, I can't forget to 
mention Epcot'sFlower and Garden Festival - we LOVE seeing all the beautiful 
flowers and topiary all over Epcot! <br>
<br>
 Now that we're DVC members we 
definitely want to give other times of the year a chance so we shall see what 
October brings! Share | <br>

<h3> Coral Reef Restaurant Review - Walt Disney World </h3>  Sunday, February 
14, 2010 <br>
<br>
 Recent discussion at the Walt Disney World (for grownups) 
Form prompted me to whip up this post. There has been some debate on whether or 
not eating at the Coral reef is not only worth your time but your money as 
well. I say no - we ate there last trip and were very disappointed.<br>
<br>
 
Here is the review:<br>
<br>
 After experiencing the Nemo ride and checking out 
the aquarium for a bit, we decided to head over to theCoral Reef restaurant. We 
were a bit early but it was fine, we just sat outside the restaurant for a bit 
and relaxed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 We had been looking forward to this 
meal for so long. I will admit, when we got inside I was a bit surprised, it 
wasn't the atmosphere I expected.<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was dreary inside. The dark 
colors coupled with dim lighting made everything seem drab. I realize it was 
supposed to mimic being in the ocean and well, obviously the ocean isn't bright 
and colorful...or is it? Ha!<br>
<br>
<br>
 This is where we sat: <br>
<br>
<br>
Wasn't a bad seat but of course we would have loved to have been closer to the 
aquarium. The kids were fairly well behaved. We didn't order an appetizer as we 
had the dining plan and well, appetizers aren't included in the plan.<br>
<br>
 
The entrees were disappointing. The portions were very small. Now, maybe 
because I am used to larger portions, what we were given might have been what a 
'normal' portion should be? That's fine but when you have a child who is under 
3 and is not able to be on the meal plan, you are told you can share entrees 
with them. I really didn't have anything to share with Wyatt so I wound up 
having to order something for him and paying out of pocket.<br>
<br>
 On the 
bright side, the food was tasty but for the portions, I think it was 
overpriced. I got Seared Sterling Salmon - with ratatouille$23.99, Fawn got 
Wild Mushroom Lasagna - roasted wild mushrooms, wilted arugula and spinach, 
fortina, parmesan, mascarpone and ricotta cheese, rustic tomato ragout$16.99 
and CJ got Grilled New York Strip Steak - served with roasted potatoes, 
watercress and tomatoes tossed in caramelized shallot vinaigrette$30.99 <br>

<br>  For dessert, I ordered the famous 'Chocolate Wave' - served with brandied 
cherries$7.99 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was yummy but wow, $7.99?! Oh well, 
eating here was an experience I will always remember but I know we will not go 
back. There are so many other restaurants we would love to try and of course, 
we have our favorites so the Coral Reef was a once and done.<br>
<br>
<b>THE 
FLIP SIDE</b> <br>
 Gray, author of SoloFriendly.com, left a comment that I 
feel is worth adding to this post:<br>
<br>

<blockquote> You've got a good point here. I really enjoyed my experience 
here, but that's because I'm a solo adult. I would have to say that this 
restaurant is really better suited to adults dining without children than those 
dining with them.While the aquarium is a big draw for kids, it becomes 
difficult to contain children sometimes who want to run up to the glass and see 
the fish. Which then bothers people dining next to the glass. Or you wind up 
disappointed because the kids can't see as well as they want because they're 
sitting across the room. Whereas I was in the middle of the room, and that was 
a fine view for me. And as you say, the portion sizes are what I would call 
&quot;normal&quot;, certainly not the usual Disneysized portions, so while 
perfect for my appetite, I wouldn't have been able to share it with anyone 
without walking away hungry. But they cost the same as Disneysized portions, so 
not the best bargain for a family. What you found to be &quot;dreary&quot; 
decor, I found to be typical adult restaurant colors and soothing, dim 
lighting. Not your typical Disney themed restaurant with bright colors that 
would appeal to families with children.<br>
<br>
 In a way, I wish Disney would 
categorize their restaurants a bit more to help guide visitors (which 
restaurants are appropriate for families with children, and which are best for 
groups without children), so it's easier to choose which restaurants will be 
best for you. I know this isn't the case for you, but many families will only 
go to WDW once in their lifetimes, and I'm sure they want to make sure it's the 
best possible experience without any disappointments.<br>
 &nbsp; <br>

 Thank you, Gray! Share | <br>

<h3> Liberty Square Riverboat </h3>  Monday, February 8, 2010 <br>
Photo Credit
<br> <br>
 I have not been on the Liberty Square Riverboat since I was in, I 
think, 3rd grade! I've been trying to think of rides and attractions that would 
be a wonderful experience for my grandmother on our upcoming trip and I really 
think she will enjoy a 20 minute ride on this legendary riverboat!<br>
<br>

<blockquote> The attraction is named Liberty Square Riverboat, but the ship 
itself is named the Liberty Belle. While the ship looks straight out of the 
19th century, it was actually built in a dry dock on Disney property for the 
1971 opening of Walt Disney World Resort.<br>
 The 17-minute trip is around Tom 
Sawyer Island; the Liberty Belle is a faithful reproduction of the highly 
ornate vessels that proudly ferried people and cargo up and down the mighty 
Mississippi River. An actual working steam engine turns the massive paddlewheel 
that propels the ship forward.</blockquote> <br>
 I think my kids will love 
this one too! Share | <br>
