<h2>Learn Chinese Words</h2> Chinese Language <br>

<p>Chinese words, phrases, and sentences are formed by Chinese characters. In 
addition to learn Chinese characters, you also need to learn Chinese words, 
phrases, and sentences.</p> 
<p>Chinese words, phrases, and sentences are formed by Chinese characters. 
Chinese characters are called the founding blocks of Chinese language. Radicals 
are the component of Chinese characters while strokes are the basic elements of 
radicals.</p> 
<p><em>KidsChinesePodcast.com is dedicated to helping you expand your Chinese 
vocabulary.</em></p> 
<p>Like learning other languages, there will come a time when you will need to 
learn Chinese words as basic vocabulary. There are numerous ways to start 
studying Chinese words. As a beginner, you may have a lot of questions on 
Chinese words.</p> 
<h3>How do you know the order to learn Chinese words?</h3> 
<p>Usually, there are three main ways to help you decide the order. They are 
frequency of use, complexity of the written language and situation. Each way 
has pros and cons.</p> 
<h4>1. Learn Chinese words by frequency of their use</h4> 
<p>One way to learn Chinese words is by frequency of their use. Like any other 
languages, you will find there are some terms which get used more frequently. 
Other expressions will be used only rarely. Many language scholars think if you 
pick up the 20% most commonly used terms in Mandarin Chinese, then you will be 
able to understand 80% of what you hear and read. This is a good news advice 
for you to learn Chinese words! However, the downside of this tactic is that 
you will find grammatical terms often come up more frequently than actual 
nouns. For example, you will see &ldquo;and&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; come 
up frequently in English sentences.</p>

<h2>Learn Chinese Characters</h2> Chinese Language <br>

<p>The Chinese language is most well known for the written and beautiful 
Chinese characters stroked on the flat paper. For most westerners, to learn 
Chinese Characters looks complex and difficult.</p> 
<p>As old as 4000 years ago, the Chinese language exists as even more popular 
today. Chinese characters are symbols of Chinese history. There are many 
resources available to help you learn Chinese characters.</p> 
<p>With China economy growth, more and more people become interested in 
Chinese culture including Chinese characters. In the same time, with the 
internet, more and more convenient and effective ways to help you learn Chinese 
become available.</p> 
<p>Wherever you are, whenever you have time, you can find a way to learn 
Chinese and learn Chinese characters. The traditional way to learn a foreign 
language was to incorporate the study within some form of primary or secondary 
education. Then continuing adult classes started springing up all over and with 
a host of other available subjects, the Chinese language was thrown in as an 
afterthought.</p>

<h2>Learn Chinese Language</h2> Chinese Language <br>

<p>For most of English Speakers, the Chinese language seems to be a complex 
mystery intimidating to unravel and to understand. However, to learn Chinese 
language is not difficult as you thought because the grammar of Chinese 
language is much simpler than English. China has over five thousand years 
history, so the Chinese language contains the rich Chinese culture. If you wish 
to learn Chinese, we suggest you start learning to speak Chinese first just 
like a little kid. You will be amazed how fast you can speak Chinese!</p> 
<p>If you are interested in the history of the Chinese language, let&rsquo;s 
take a quick look at it. Historically, the Chinese language evolved from 
Proto-Sino-Tibetan and has ascended into modern day with most Chinese 
communities speaking either Mandarin or Cantonese forms of the Chinese language 
while Mandarin is the official Chinese language. There are different varieties 
on both of these depending on the geographical localities. The linguistics of 
the Chinese language are easier to trace back in time than are the characters 
used for Chinese alphabet, as there is rare documentation found to support the 
origins.</p>

<h2>Chinese Podcast: A Great Way to Learn Chinese</h2> Chinese Language <br>

<h3>What is Podcast?</h3> 
<p>A podcast is a series of digital audio or video file that are released 
episodically and often it&rsquo;s downloaded through internet. The word 
replaced webcast in common use with the success of the iPod (one of the most 
popular portable MP3 players) and its role in the rising popularity and 
innovation of web feeds.</p> 
<p>You do not have to have an iPod to listen to a podcast. In fact, there are 
many other MP3 players that are good for listening to podcasts. You can listen 
to podcasts on anything that plays MP3 files. Once the podcast is downloaded, 
it&rsquo;s just an MP3.You can listen to it using a computer or, more commonly, 
to a portable MP3 player. At the core a podcast is an audio file that is 
automatically received from the internet and then synced to your MP3 player.</p>
<p>You can listen to a podcast exactly what you want, when you want and how 
you want! With podcasts, you&rsquo;re in control. You can rewind a podcast. You 
can play it over and over. You can pause it, store it wherever you want. You 
can delete it when you want. Podcasts give you the control. You can listen to 
podcasts on your computer, burn them to CD or transfer them to your MP3 player. 
You&rsquo;re in control of when and how you listen.</p> 
<h3>Podcast: A Great Learning Tool</h3> 
<p>From educational point of view, podcasting is giving educators another way 
to meet today&rsquo;s students where they live and learn on the Internet and on 
audio players. Now, the students are able to take the teacher anywhere by bring 
their podcast with them.<br>

<h2>Kids Chinese</h2> Chinese Language <br>

<h3>Why Do Parents Want Their Kids To Learn More Than One Language?</h3> 
<p>We live in a global society now. More and more people are bilingual and 
multilingual because their daily life and work needs. It is the reality and it 
is a trend with the globalization. In California, the United States, one 
immigrants&rsquo; area where I live, almost every child is bilingual, and some 
of them are multilingual. I know a lot of people in Europe are multilingual.</p>
<p>There are many benefits for being multilingual. I can speak three 
languages, Chinese, English and Japanese, and work in California, the United 
States. I am using the three languages at my work place every day, which 
benefits me a lot on my professional work. In addition, I have many friends who 
came from China, Japan, India, and U.S etc.</p> 
<h4>Raising multilingual children has many benefits.</h4> 
<p>If you are a multilingual, you can speak to many more people, understand 
their culture more, and communicate with them better. By being able to 
communicate with more people better, you gain more opportunities in your career 
and your life! For example, the opportunities to make more friends, the job 
opportunities. Enjoy more in your life by broadening your view!!</p> 
<h4>Language learning periods</h4> 
<p>In 1800, a young boy called the wild boy was found in a forest in France. 
Despite many efforts, the boy never learnt to talk. He was thought to have 
passed language learning periods.</p>

<h2>How to Learn Chinese to Achieve the Best Result</h2> Newsletter <br>

<h3>Kids Chinese Podcast: Newsletter No.1</h3> 
<p>Dear subscribers,</p> 
<p><em>Welcome to Chinese Lessons at KidsChinesePodcast.com!</em></p> 
<p>Chinese is the one of the most spoken language in the world. Mandarin 
Chinese language is the official language of China and Taiwan, as well as one 
of four official languages of Singapore, and one of six official languages of 
the United Nations. Kids Chinese Podcast teaches Mandarin Chinese.</p> 
<p><em>Congratulations on starting your journey to learn Chinese!</em></p> 
<h3>How to learn Chinese to achieve the best learning result?</h3> 
<p>Because different person has different learning style, the answer to the 
question may be different. We list our research result and suggestion as the 
following to help you learning Chinese and we will start the learning Chinese 
journey with you, together, we will explore and improve our Chinese lessons to 
help you achieve the best learning result!</p> 
<p>Kids Chinese Podcast is designed for kids from 5 years old up and adult 
Chinese learners to learn Mandarin Chinese. This Chinese course helps you to 
learn Chinese listening and speaking via podcast, and Chinese reading and 
writing via podcast transcript and exercise worksheet. Lessons&rsquo; topics 
are designed using practical dialogues starting with focusing on kids&rsquo; 
daily life in the United States while you receive systematic training on 
Chinese listening, speaking, reading and writing.</p> 
<p><strong>We recommend the following steps to achieve the best Chinese 
learning results.</strong><br>
 1. Language Study Research shows that using 
auditory and visual media at same time can achieve better learning results.
<strong>Sign up and become a registered member.</strong> After you sign up, you 
will get access to all transcript and PDF worksheet. Have a transcript in front 
of you when listening to the lesson.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Start early as possible as you can</strong>. When children 
acquire their mother tongue, they understand and speak before they are capable 
of reading and writing. This is also true when learning a foreign language. In 
the Level-1 lessons, our goal is to let students have a feeling on Chinese 
Mandarin&rsquo;s phonics and Chinese Characters, and build a sense of Chinese 
language in a short time. Therefore, the transcript serves a very good study 
guide. Musical tones are perhaps the most difficult thing in Mandarin Chinese, 
that&rsquo;s why we use the native-language-acquiring approach, namely, the 
just listening and then understanding way. Language Research Study reports that 
kids under five can speak a language without any accent just a native speaker. 
Kids can be parents&rsquo; teacher in terms of speaking and correct 
pronunciation. Help you child to start learning Chinese early as possible as 
you can!</p> 
<p>3.<strong> Listen as many times as possible whenever you have a chance
</strong>, when you driving your child to school, before bedtime etc.</p> 
<p>4. Try to imitate after the teacher, even if the sounds seem to be 
difficult to pronounce. Kids usually are not shy, adults,<strong>don&rsquo;t be 
shy</strong>!</p> 
<p>5. The worksheet of each lesson has a translation exercise for you, so 
please fill in your answer and then<strong> compare your answer to the correct 
one</strong> that the teacher announced at the end of your next lesson.</p> 
<p>6. <strong>Practice what you have learned whenever you have a chance
</strong>. That&rsquo;s why we promote parents and kids learn Chinese together. 
Parents and kids are the best study pal, this approach motivates parents to set 
a good role model on discipline and nurture kids a good study habit, in the 
same time, parents and kids learn, practice speaking Chinese in a really fun 
and effective way.</p> 
<p>7. <strong>Encourage good study habits </strong>by scheduling regular 
Chinese study time. For example, everyday, after dinner, spend about 20 
minutes. Firstly, listen the audio lesson about 10 minutes, then do the 
worksheet to practice reading and writing for about 5 minutes then spend 
another 5 minutes, practice speaking. Parents and kids can talk using what we 
have learned in the lesson and use what we have learned in the previous lessons.
</p> 
<p>8. <strong>Be persistent and never give up</strong>! Unlike many Western 
languages which share some common linguistic roots with English and which can 
often be learned fairly quickly with a large amount of self-study for adults, 
acquiring a basic competency in a language as different from English as Chinese 
requires a high level of commitment and persistence. If parents can be persist, 
your child will be too!</p> 
<p>9. One of the best ways parents can <strong>help with your child&rsquo;s 
education</strong>is to take part yourself. <strong>Sign up </strong>for the 
Chinese lessons and learn Chinese together with your child.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Parents and kids listen to Kids Chinese Podcast together and 
learn Chinese together, having fun and achieve the best learning results.</em>

<h3>What People are Saying&nbsp;</h3> 
<p>Although I have been learning Chinese for the past 3 years, I failed to 
master the correct Chinese pronunciations. As a result, I feel as if I had hit 
a wall in my path of knowledge. Since then, I restarted learning pinyin using 
Kids Chinese Podcast lessons as a beginner. 4 months later, my pronunciation 
has improved to a point with which I can now confidently speak Chinese in front 
of my Chinese colleagues. I really like Aihua's native Chinese pronunciation. 
Thanks a lot, Aihua and Amy!<br>
&mdash; <strong>Dan</strong><em></em></p> 
<p>Each Kids Chinese Podcast lesson is around 15 minutes, which is short and 
sweet. It fits in well with my busy work schedule. The lesson offers very 
useful dialogs that can be practiced in my daily life.<br>
&mdash; <strong>
George</strong><em></em></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m a Japanese. I like Kids Chinese Podcast Chinese lessons since I 
can learn Chinese and English together. Good job, Aihua and Amy! Thank you!<br>

&mdash;<strong>Haruna</strong><em></em></p> 
<p>I'm a grandma and learning Chinese together with my granddaughter, we like 
and enjoy Kids Chinese Podcast lessons. Thanks!<br>
&mdash; <strong>Hanae
</strong><em></em></p> 
<p>English is my second language, now I am starting learning Chinese. My 
friend referred me to Kids Chinese Podcast. I found that Aihua's English is so 
easy to understand besides she speaks Mandarin Chinese so perfectly. I am 
really enjoying listening Kids Chinese Podcast lessons, and I'm learning a lot. 
Thanks!<br>
&mdash; <strong>Akiko</strong><em></em></p> 
<p>I think Kids Chinese Podcast is by far the best means of learning Chinese. 
My 6 years old daughter and I started learning Chinese together two months ago 
using Kids Chinese Podcast lessons. I was amazed by my daughter's 
pronunciation; my Chinese colleague said that my daughter was speaking just 
like a native speaker. I printed out PDF worksheet for her weekly, and my 
daughter loves writing Chinese pinyin and character. Her writing is also 
improving much faster than it was 2 months ago. I have made up my mind to set 
up a good role model for my daughter by learning Chinese myself, and helping my 
daughter learn Chinese as well. I truly believe raising my daughter bilingually 
is the best gift ever I can give her.<br>
&mdash; <strong>Kathy</strong><em>
</em></p> 
<p>I am 63 years old and I am a complete novice. Learning as the children do 
is a brilliant concept. I appreciate all your dedication to this approach. 
Excellent website. Wish you every success with it. &ldquo;can&rsquo;t teach an 
old dog new tricks&rdquo; or &ldquo;never too old to learn&rdquo; I think the 
latter.<br>
