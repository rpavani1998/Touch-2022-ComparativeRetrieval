<p><b>Instructors</b></p>

backgrounds and interests. All instructors are native speakers or speak with 
native-level proficiency. They are carefully selected for communicative skills, 
talent, and enthusiasm to share their language.</p> 
<p> Learning a Language - It's Not Easy, or Is It? </p> 
<p> Whether &quot;learning&quot; a foreign language is easy or not depends on 
your objectives. Ordering food in a restaurant and handling basic introductions 
can be learned without too much difficulty. Achieving true fluency requires 
substantially more time.</p> 
<p> The idea of a person who learns a foreign language fluently in almost no 
time with no effort is largely a myth. It generally takes time and practice, 
but the process can be a fun and rewarding experience.</p> 
<p>Learning a Language can be Fun </p> 
<p>We offer the opportunity to learn 36 different languages at our Language 
Door School in Orange County at Irvine. Our comfortable, casual environment 
helps to make learning the language of your choice fun and convenient. We 
schedule our classes at times that work for busy adults. Enrich your life as 
you learn one language or learn many.</p> 
<p> Schools of Thought </p> 
<p> There are many schools of thought on how best to learn a foreign language. 
Many of these schools claim they have found the &quot;best&quot; way to learn. 
We feel that the best way to learn depends on the person. Some people learn 
better orally, some visually. Some learn best when they want to, others when 
they have to. Some prefer rules and structure, others practice and application. 
Nobody can tell you what works best, but teachers, books, and experience can 
help show you the way.</p> 
<p> Furthermore, we also believe that a foreign language can best be learned 
through a combination of instruction, study, and practice. Any one of these in 
isolation, while still be helpful, will generally be less effective and 
rewarding.</p> 
<p> For instance, consider the benefit of having a lesson each week and doing 
nothing else, compared to having the same lesson each week but learning the 
vocabulary beforehand, or reinforcing what you learned after the lesson through 
actual use in conversation.</p> 
<p> Vocabulary </p> 
<p> Some people benefit from learning vocabulary lists, while for others the 
effort exceeds the rewards. Regardless, vocabulary forms the building blocks of 
language. Whether by studying lists or learning though usage, you'll want to 
develop some vocabulary.</p> 
<p> The amount of words in a language can be staggering (from twenty thousand 
to more than one hundred thousand depending on the language and how the words 
are counted). However, one hundred words can be sufficient for basic 
conversation, and a couple thousand for fairly normal conversation.</p> 
<p> If you want to improve your vocabulary retention, consider trying word 
associations. The association can be either logical or illogical, whichever 
works best for you.</p> 
<p> For instance, the Spanish word el coche can logically be associated with 
coach (like a carriage) which was the predecessor to the car. It may help to 
imagine your car as a coach, or imagine horses pulling it. The illogical 
approach might say el coche sounds like coach (such as a basketball coach), and 
try to link coach and car in the most vivid way possible. For instance, imagine 
your basketball coach lifting your car above his or her head, then throwing it 
at a basketball hoop or through a wall. You can remember that el coche is 
masculine in Spanish by adding to the image - in the first example, imagine 
male horses pulling your car, or in the second example, use a male coach.</p> 
<p> The time it takes to create these associations can pay dividends later on 
through easier retention. As you practice Spanish or any language, you'll get 
quicker and create better associations.</p> 
<p> Grammar </p> 
<p> People often point out that kids learn language easily, and kids don't 
study grammar. Kids do learn easily in some respects (i.e., accent), but 
consider the amount of time they spend playing with friends, watching cartoons, 
or with other activities in that language. Many experts feel adults prefer to 
think logically, and learn better based on structure and rules such as grammar.
</p> 
<p> Comprehension </p> 
<p> Comprehension improves with practice, whether through lessons, reading, or 
conversation.</p> 
<p> The recent growth of DVD's provides a great tool to improve comprehension. 
The language options vary by movie, but many have audio and/or subtitle options 
in major languages. For instance if learning French, try watching a movie first 
in French audio with English subtitles, then French audio with French 
subtitles, then French audio with no subtitles. For better results, watch the 
movie with a dictionary nearby, and when you hear or see a word you still don't 
understand, look it up! The audio track and subtitles do not always match, but 
they are usually close enough to provide a very effective learning tool.</p> 
<p>  Summary </p> 
<p> We feel there's no &quot;secret&quot; to learning a foreign language. We 
recommend you learn based on what works best for you. Discuss different methods 
and tools with us or with your teacher. If possible, use a combination of 
instruction, study, and practice. Best of luck in this fun and rewarding 
experience!</p>
