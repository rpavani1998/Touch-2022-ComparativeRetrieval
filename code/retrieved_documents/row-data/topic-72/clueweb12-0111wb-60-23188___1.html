<p>&quot;The language programs through Language Door San Diego provide a 
relaxed environment for learning a second language. My instructor is patient 
and a native speaker. The instructor makes learning easy by relating the 
language to real-life situations.&quot; &#150; Ed, San Diego School</p> 
<p> &quot;Manuel [the teacher] is very friendly and patient with his 
students.&nbsp; The atmosphere is relaxed.&nbsp; It's an excellent environment 
for working people to learn or refresh their knowledge of Spanish,&quot; Brett 
from Burbank, Los Angeles School.</p> 
<p>&quot;The staff (at Language Door San Diego) is very friendly and has 
helped me feel very comfortable about learning a new language. The facility is 
clean and organized making the conditions pleasant to learn in. I would 
recommend this facility to anyone wanting to learn another language.&quot; 
&ndash; Natasha, San Diego School</p> 
<p> &quot;Material is presented well.&nbsp; Classes are small and 
private.&nbsp; They are ideal for learning Japanese,&quot; Matthew from Irvine, 
Orange County School.</p> 
<p> &quot;This Russian class is really helping me to reinforce the studying I 
have done in my spare time.&nbsp; I have noticed a marked improvement in my 
conversation, pronunciation and speaking ability in just a few weeks,&quot; 
Pilar from Los Angeles, Los Angeles School.</p> 
<p> &quot;Great teacher! I was stuck in a rut with my Portuguese. Fernanda 
[the teacher] gave me several new techniques and activities that I hadn't 
thought of to really increase my ability to understand and write the language 
better. Her class is a good combination of conversation, reading, writing, 
grammar... and fun,&quot; Blair from Mission Viejo, Orange County School.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm very pleased with the classes I've taken at Language Door San 
Diego. My instructor is a native speaker and uses a variety of fun but 
challenging teaching techniques. And my class is on Sundays making it easier to 
avoid scheduling conflicts with my job.&quot; &ndash; Eric, - San Diego School
</p> 
<p> &quot;So far I only have positive feedback. Sam [the teacher] makes the 
complex seem simple, which is essential for a language like Arabic,&quot; Chris 
from Westlake Village, Los Angeles School.</p>
