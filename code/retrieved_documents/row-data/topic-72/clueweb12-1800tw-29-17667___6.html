be&nbsp;both? <br>

<h1>Kid&rsquo;s&nbsp;menu.</h1> Posted on April 29, 2012 by Stephen Abbott <br>
<p>There are few domestic tasks that also allow for as much creativity, skill 
and pleasure than cooking. You can execute a chore; put a few ingredients 
together to create a simple meal with minimal preparation and flair. Or you can 
turn a meal into an event; an experiment in flavours, presentation, culture and 
indulgence. Or anything in between.</p> 
<p>Taking a kid into the kitchen is an adventure. As dads, we get to show off 
our skills, ensuring the next generation carries forward any delicious habits 
we&rsquo;ve honed over the years. But if you&rsquo;re inviting kids into your 
kitchen to help, prepare to have inexperienced little hands doing the helping.
</p> 
<p>Here are a few things I&rsquo;ve learned, and a few of the special tools 
that make your time a little easier, and a lot more fun.<em>One disclaimer, 
though: I am not a chef. I am not even a cook. So take this advice as a 
&lsquo;Really-Cool-Dad-who-tries&rsquo;. With a grain of salt, as they say.</em>
</p> 
<p><strong>The Basics</strong><br>
 As a general rule, you should buy the best 
quality equipment and ingredients you can afford. There are some items (such as 
wooden spoons) that trick you into paying for style rather than substance, but 
often there is a real advantage to paying for better quality. As for food, 
fresh and local are good rules. Explore a market with your kid; a market owner 
who loves to share their knowledge with children is a good clue that they care 
about their product and their customers.</p> 
<p><strong>Cookware</strong><br>
 Let&rsquo;s assume you have the basic set of 
sturdy pots and pans. That&rsquo;s good. Depending on how strong your kids are, 
you may look at getting a few extra pieces that are smaller and lighter. If 
you&rsquo;ve ever tried to lift a large cast iron pan, you know that it can be 
tricky even for an adult. The compromise on heat quality won&rsquo;t be an 
issue, and the kids will get more chances to be involved.</p> 
<p><strong>Knives.</strong><br>
 Knives are dangerous. Knives are powerful. 
Knives are cool. Knife skills are the benchmark of respect in a kitchen, and it 
takes practice. Lots and lots of practice.</p> 
<p>Your 8&rdquo; chef&rsquo;s knife is your best friend in the kitchen. Invest 
in a good one and take care of it. You should also make sure you have a good 
paring knife, one that their little hands can manipulate easily. Learning how 
to handle these two knives safely is important for kids.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the challenge: sharp knives are safer. While it may seem 
backwards to keep the knife sharp for little hands, dull knives slip easily, 
creating nasty opportunity to miss the mark and slice into a finger or two (or 
worse). And they cut poorly, making it frustrating and not fun. Teach your 
child to respect the knife with proper holding, cutting and storing techniques.
</p> 
<p>Only you will know when you can trust your little kid with a knife. Like 
many things, it will probably be sooner than you would like.</p> 
<p><strong>The iconic KitchenAid&trade; mixer.</strong><br>
 Mixing. Whipping. 
Kneading. Licking the beaters. What else can I say?</p> 
<p><strong>Pasta roller/cutter</strong><br>
 Making fresh pasta is easy, and 
kids are always excited to eat the results. It&rsquo;s easy to use, and will 
last a lifetime if you take care of it. A basic, fresh tomato sauce is fine at 
first, but different shapes allow a kid to experiment with different sauce 
textures and tastes. You can make green pasta and red pasta, paring it with 
sauces in exciting ways. Stuffing pasta is takes a little more patience, but 
it&rsquo;s a good step forward when linguine becomes a little too routine.</p> 
<p><strong>Pizza stone</strong><br>
 We use both an air tray an a pizza stone. 
The air tray cooks the pizza through and gets a thicker, sturdy crust, then we 
transfer to the stone to crisp it up. Cooking with the stone takes the pizza 
from good to amazing.</p> 
<p>Pizza is big round taste experiment. Get creative; it&rsquo;s easy for 
everyone to make their own combination and then share the results. While I 
won&rsquo;t ever pretend that pizza is actually a health food, it&rsquo;s easy 
to get vegetable into the mix.<br>
<strong></strong><br>
<strong>Peeler</strong>
<br> This should be one of the easiest tasks to get little ones helping. Get a 
peeler that fits comfortably in little hands so they can learn good technique. 
(I&rsquo;ve heard the Y shaped peelers are easy and effective, but I 
haven&rsquo;t used one yet.)</p> 
<p><strong>Measuring</strong><br>
 Get devices that are easy to handle and 
easy to read. As adults, we can have lots of complicated multi-function 
devices, but these can be confusing to new cooks. Simple, basic sets help kids 
understand the task at hand without having to decipher a cook&rsquo;s codes.</p>
<p><strong>Herbs &amp; Spices</strong><br>
Different cultures use different 
spices as staples, so go exploring and talk with friends. Spices add an 
intensity of flavour, or combine to create taste profiles that shifts food from 
bland to wow. Taste is a sense that actually develops as we grow older, so if 
your child doesn&rsquo;t like something today, don&rsquo;t despair. You can try 
again soon enough.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that most herbs are also pretty easy to grow in the smallest 
of gardens, so fresh versions are an option.</p> 
<p><strong>Eggs</strong><br>
 Kids love to break eggs. Even if they 
aren&rsquo;t helping you with anything else, call the into the kitchen to break 
the eggs. Be prepared for accidents, so break and separate into a bowl before 
adding them to recipes.</p> 
<p><strong>Practice</strong><br>
 Give yourself lots of time to prepare a meal 
with a kid. Make a habit of getting all the ingredients ready before you start 
anything, and plan to waste a bit of food while learning to cook. Things will 
get broken or squished or dropped or burnt. It&rsquo;s okay.</p> 
<p>Get used to eating imperfect dishes and &ldquo;unique&rdquo; flavours. 
Nothing is more discouraging to a young chef than making something nobody wants 
to eat, so be ready for anything.</p> 
<p><strong>Clean</strong><br>
 Always keep your kitchen clean. A clean space 
is safer, easier to work in, and healthier for everyone. Don&rsquo;t wait until 
the end of the meal to clean the kitchen. Take advantage of little moments to 
get rid of trash, tidy your tools and prepare for the next step. Whether you 
use microfibre cloths and water, or industrial strength bleach and 
disinfectants, be sure to understand how to handle food safely and keep your 
hands and work surfaces clean.</p> 
<p>Cooking with kids can be fun and rewarding. It takes little more time and a 
lot more planning, but it is something you can do everyday, and a skill they 
will use for the rest of their lives.</p> 
<p>What have you learned about cooking with kids?</p>

<p>Great post Stephen,<br>
 My boys love to help me cook. Our favorite thing 
to cook together is home made pancakes and waffles on the weekends. Any recipe 
with batter or dough is good for younger kids because there&rsquo;s a lot more 
egg cracking, scooping, pouring and mixing than cutting.<br>
 But now 
it&rsquo;s the middle of the afternoon and I&rsquo;m hungry!<br>

<p>Can you believe my son doesn&rsquo;t like pancakes? I thought every kid 
loved them, but apparently not mine. I&rsquo;ve tried all sorts of things to 
show him how magical they are (berries, chocolate, whipped cream, bananas) but 
nothing seems to work. He did pull off a frittata for me, though, so I 
can&rsquo;t complain.</p> 
<p>Thank for the comment.</p> <br>

entertaining, and maybe even a little uncomfortable for some people. Please
