<p><b>Flu shots due; but vaccine</b></p> 
<p><b>is scarce</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>They're here! </p> 
<p>It is time to roll up the sleeves and prepare for a flu shot - if you're in 
a category health officials deem critical.</p> 
<p>That includes children 6-23 months of age and anyone who comes in contact 
with them regularly, and most people over 50 years old.</p> 
<p>To facilitate the flu shot distribution, San Juan Basin Health Department 
has scheduled several off-site clinics in the area, as well as regular shot 
administration 8-9 a.m. daily in the office at 502 S. 8th St. in Pagosa Springs.
</p> 
<p>Tuesday's announcement of the withdrawal of all flu vaccine produced by an 
English laboratory will not affect immediate local plans because vaccine 
already had been purchased from an American production facility.</p> 
<p>However, with the announcement of an anticipated major flu vaccine 
shortage, San Juan Basin Health Department is requesting community cooperation 
in targeting the vaccine to those at highest risk for influenza.</p> 
<p>Susie Kleckner, office administrator, said the vaccination program at the 
office will start Tuesday, Oct. 12.</p> 
<p>The following day shots will be available at the senior center in the 
community center building 11 a.m.-2 p.m. &quot;While we'll be targeting the 
senior citizens,&quot; Kleckner said, &quot;the doors will be open to anyone on 
that day.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another shot clinic will be operated 1-4 p.m. Friday, Oct. 15 at Ponderosa 
Do-It-Best and still another is scheduled 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 21, 
at the Catholic Church in Arboles.</p> 
<p>For the month of October, the Health Department requests that only people 
in the following groups receive flu vaccine:</p> 
<p>- children 6-23 months old;</p> 
<p>- people 50 years of age or older; </p> 
<p>- anyone who has anemia, heart, lung, kidney or metabolic disease;</p> 
<p>- household contacts of those at highest risk;</p> 
<p>- health care workers.</p> 
<p>Beginning Nov. 1, clinics will be open to the public on a first-come, 
first-served basis. San Juan Basin Health Department's flu clinic schedule is 
posted on the Web site, www.sjbhd.org. Flu shot cost will be $20 and the cost 
is covered for Medicare recipients by Part B. They must have their card in hand 
when getting the shot. The shots can be covered under Medicaid for children, 
but not adults.</p> 
<p>According to the recommendation of the federal Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices the following people are at high risk for complications 
from the flu and should be vaccinated:</p> 
<p>- People 65 years and older; </p> 
<p>- People who live in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities that 
house those with long-term illnesses;</p> 
<p>- Adults and children 6 months and older who have chronic heart or lung 
conditions, including asthma;</p> 
<p>- Adults and children 6 months and older who needed regular medical care or 
were in a hospital during the previous year because of a metabolic disease 
(like diabetes), chronic kidney disease, or weakened immune system (including 
immune system problems caused by medicines or by infection with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS);</p> 
<p>- Children between 6 months and 18 years of age who are on long-term 
aspirin therapy. (If given aspirin while they have the flu, they are at risk of 
a severe illness called Reye syndrome);</p> 
<p>- Women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; and </p> 
<p>- All children 6 to 23 months of age. </p> 
<p><b>People 50 to 64 </b> </p> 
<p>Nearly one-third of people 50 to 64 years of age in the United States have 
one or more medical condition that place them at increased risk for serious 
complications from the flu. For that reason, since 2000, it has been 
recommended that all people 50 to 64 years of age get vaccinated each year to 
increase the number of high-risk 50- to 64-year-olds who are protected against 
the flu.</p> 
<p><b>People who can give the flu to others at high risk </b></p> 
<p>To help prevent spreading the flu to those at high risk for complications 
from the illness, the following people should get vaccinated if shots are 
available:</p> 
<p>- Anyone (including children 6 months and older) who lives with someone in 
a high-risk group;</p> 
<p>- Doctors, nurses, and other employees in hospitals and doctors' offices, 
including emergency response services;</p> 
<p>- People who work in nursing homes and long-term care facilities who have 
contact with patients or residents;</p> 
<p>- People who work in assisted living and other residences for people in 
high-risk groups; and</p> 
<p>- Anyone who provides care to those in high-risk groups (including children 
under the age of 2). </p> 
<p><b>Pregnancy and flu </b> </p> 
<p>Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from the flu and are 
more likely to be hospitalized from flu complications than non-pregnant women 
of the same age. In previous worldwide outbreaks of influenza (like the 
pandemics of 1918-19 and 1957-58), there were many deaths among pregnant women 
associated with influenza.</p> 
<p>It is not known why pregnant women are at higher risk, but pregnancy can 
change a woman's immune system and affect her cardiovascular system (heart and 
lung function). These changes may place a pregnant woman at increased risk for 
complications from the flu. Because of the increased risk for flu-related 
complications, ACIP recommends that women who will be pregnant during the flu 
get vaccinated.</p> 
<p><b>Children 6 to 23 months</b></p> 
<p>Studies have shown that healthy children under the age of 2 years are at 
increased risk for flu-related hospitalization compared with older healthy 
children. Because of this increased risk, it's recommended that all children 
(even healthy children) 6 to 23 months of age get vaccinated. (The influenza 
vaccine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in 
children younger than 6 months. This is why the recommendation is limited to 
children 6 to 23 months rather than all children less than 2 years old.)</p> 
<p>Note: Children under the age of 9 receiving the vaccine for the first time 
will require two doses. The first dose &quot;primes&quot; the immune system. A 
second dose is required to produce a protective immune response.</p> 
<p><b>General population </b> </p> 
<p>Anyone who wants to lower their chances of getting the flu can get 
vaccinated, if supplies of vaccine are available after October.</p> 
<p>People who provide essential community services (such as police officers 
and firefighters) should consider getting a vaccinated to minimize disruption 
of key public-service activities during flu outbreaks. Students who live in 
dormitories or anyone who lives in an institutional setting should be 
encouraged to get vaccinated because crowded living conditions may mean that 
the flu can spread more easily.</p> 
<p><b>Breastfeeding mothers</b> </p> 
<p>It is safe for breastfeeding women to get vaccinated. Antibody against 
influenza viruses are passed in breast milk and may offer additional protection 
against the flu for infants.</p> 
<p><b>Travelers </b></p> 
<p>The risk of getting the flu during travel depends on the destination and 
time of travel. In the tropics, the flu can occur at any time of year. In the 
Southern Hemisphere, most influenza activity occurs from April through 
September. In the Northern and Southern hemispheres, travelers also can be 
exposed to the flu during the summer, especially when traveling as part of 
large tourist groups that include people from areas of the world where 
influenza virus is circulating.</p> 
<p>Depending on their health condition, providers should consider vaccinating 
travelers at high risk for flu-related complications, especially if they plan 
to:</p> 
<p>- travel to the tropics;</p> 
<p>- travel with large tourist groups at any time of year; or</p> 
<p>- travel to the Southern Hemisphere from April through September</p> 
<p>People 50 years and older who are at high risk for complications from the 
flu should talk to their doctor before they travel to find out about the 
symptoms and risks of influenza and whether they should carry antiviral 
medications with them for either prevention or treatment.</p> 
<p>For more information related to influenza prevention for travelers, visit 
the CDC Traveler's Health Web site at www.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/influenza.htm.
</p> 
<p><b>Pneumonia vaccinations</b></p> 
<p>Pneumonia shots will be administered at the health department offices only. 
Cost is $35 and they, too, are covered by Medicare Part B.</p> 
<p>Kleckner said health officials recommend the pneumonia shots, within five 
years, for anyone over 65 who has had an initial shot.</p> 
<p>If you had an initial pneumonia shot before age 65, one more is recommended 
by age 70.</p> 
<p>Generally, those will be the only two such shots specified for the most 
at-risk group, the senior citizens.</p>

<p><b>Runway paving to begin at airport</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Barring weather-related delays, an ongoing schedule of efforts to upgrade 
Stevens Field will apparently remain active for at least the next several weeks.
</p> 
<p>That's the latest outlook according to Ken Fox, county airport manager, who 
presented Archuleta County commissioners an airport activity update during this 
week's board meeting.</p> 
<p>One initiative expected to begin this week is the paving of the airport 
runway.</p> 
<p>Weather permitting, the north part of the runway should be operational 
&quot;by the time the snow flies,&quot; said Fox.</p> 
<p>According to Fox, the remainder of runway paving operations are tentatively 
scheduled for completion sometime next spring and early summer.</p> 
<p>Also expected to begin this week is primary preparation and construction of 
the new fuel farm site, with completion anticipated within the next four to 
five weeks. </p> 
<p>Other topics addressed by Fox Tuesday included agreements with private 
citizens related to the construction of new hangars, which Fox indicated are 
nearing completion. </p> 
<p>Delivery of steel that will be used in hangar construction, said Fox, is 
probably &quot;four to six weeks out.&quot;</p> 
<p>Projects on the airport's &quot;long-term&quot; list include the 
establishment of a new parallel taxiway, which is not expected to begin until 
2007.</p> 
<p>Also on the distant horizon, said Fox, is obtainment of an automated 
weather observation system, or &quot;AWOS,&quot; which Fox indicated will 
probably be delayed &quot;at least another year&quot; if not longer.</p> 
<p>With regard to funding, Fox told the board the county is apparently in line 
for a $250,000 grant that will be put toward additional paving.</p> 
<p>Fox indicated official notification of the grant award is expected to be 
determined during the grant review portion of the Colorado Airport Operators 
Association fall conference scheduled later this month.</p> 
<p>Finally, Fox told the board he is attending a conference this week at 
Denver International Airport designed to broaden understanding of environmental 
issues affecting state airports and how to properly address such concerns.</p>

<p><b>Public records spat irks county officials</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Is there an internal conflict brewing inside the Archuleta County 
courthouse?</p> 
<p>Based on what transpired during this week's board of county commissioners' 
meeting, the likely answer is &quot;yes.&quot;</p> 
<p>Speaking on behalf of staff near the onset of Tuesday's board meeting, Bill 
Steele, county administrator, requested and was granted permission from the 
board to seek &quot;a legal opinion&quot; regarding the authority of county 
departments to obtain public records housed inside the county assessor's office.
</p> 
<p>Apparently, recent attempts by at least two county departments to obtain 
public records from the assessor's office have failed.</p> 
<p>In further discussion of the matter, Mamie Lynch, board chair, described 
the apparent unwillingness of the assessor's office to provide requested public 
records as &quot;an ongoing situation.&quot;</p> 
<p>Said Lynch, &quot;I know it's been going on for four years.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to Lynch, some of the public records that are apparently being 
denied by the assessor's office could affect the county's ability to comply 
with accounting and financial reporting requirements stipulated in Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board statement No. 34, commonly referred to as &quot;GASB 
34.&quot;</p> 
<p>Though she did not elaborate, with regard to past attempts to obtain public 
records, said Lynch, &quot;In trying to get there, we've had obstacles.&quot;
</p> 
<p>As a result, the board and administration are in the process of 
&quot;trying to find out what alternatives are available to us,&quot; said 
Lynch.</p> 
<p>In short, when asked if county employees are being blatantly denied access 
to public records by the assessor's office and/or Keren Prior, county assessor 
- &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Lynch.</p> 
<p>Prior did not attend Tuesday's board meeting, but gave a different account 
of the situation during a telephone interview Wednesday.</p> 
<p>In response to Lynch's assertion, &quot;No, they are not being denied 
information,&quot; said Prior. &quot;They get what they request.&quot;</p> 
<p>However, Prior indicated there may be some confusion surrounding recent 
requests from the county global information systems department for maps on file 
within the assessor's office, requests that apparently carry a price tag.</p> 
<p>&quot;Maybe they object to the fact, but state statute says that I am not 
only the custodian of these records and should maintain them, but that I can 
also charge a reasonable amount for them,&quot; said Prior.</p> 
<p>&quot;But everything in this office that is public information is certainly 
accessible,&quot; added Prior. </p> 
<p>&quot;So I don't know why they need to consult our county attorneys, what 
the intent is or what the problem is,&quot; she concluded.</p> 
<p>In other business this week, the board: </p> 
<p>- approved an intergovernmental agreement with the town of Pagosa Springs 
indicating the county will contribute $315,000 toward the reconstruction of 
Cemetery Road, roughly half of the project's estimated cost;</p> 
<p>- at no cost to the county, agreed to sponsor a Pagosa Lakes Property 
Owners Association initiative to seek a Great Outdoors Colorado grant which, if 
obtained, will be used to fund trail construction along Lake Forest Circle and 
North Pagosa Boulevard;</p> 
<p>- approved the 2005 USDA Wildlife Services agreement regarding predator 
control and wildlife damage management;</p> 
<p>- approved a request from Andy Fautheree, county veterans' services 
officer, concerning submittal of a Veterans of Foreign Wars grant application 
aimed at upgrading transportation services for county veterans in 2005.</p>

<p><b>Downtown historic district a step closer </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs is one step closer to the creation of a historic business 
district following this week's town council meeting.</p> 
<p>After a first reading Tuesday night, council members unanimously approved 
an ordinance establishing the downtown block along Pagosa and Lewis Streets 
(between 4th and 5th streets) and the Archuleta County courthouse as a historic 
overlay district.</p> 
<p>Sixty-three properties are located within the proposed district's 
boundaries, and while not every building will qualify for historic designation, 
more than enough will apparently meet the required criteria.</p> 
<p>According to the ordinance which gained preliminary approval this week, in 
order to be eligible for historic designation, properties within proposed 
district boundaries must exhibit the following characteristics:</p> 
<p>- They have character, interest of value as part of the development, 
heritage or cultural characteristics of local significance and are valuable as 
a part of the heritage of the town.</p> 
<p>- They are identified with a person or persons who significantly 
contributed to the culture and development of the town.</p> 
<p>- They exemplify cultural, economic, social or historic heritage.</p> 
<p>- Their structures are a significant component of a historically 
significant neighborhood and the preservation of the structure is important for 
the maintenance of that neighborhood character.</p> 
<p>- Their structures are critical to the preservation of the character and 
identity of the local community because of their relationship in terms of size, 
location and architectural similarity to other structures of historical or 
architectural significance.</p> 
<p>With regard to age requirements, &quot;We use 50 years as a baseline,&quot; 
said Tamra Allen, the town's historic preservation officer, indicating there is 
apparently no steadfast rule that applies.</p> 
<p>Feedback from business owners within the proposed district has been 
favorable; a recent town survey indicates roughly 71 percent of business owners 
are willing to participate in the initiative - far exceeding the required, 
51-percent response rate.</p> 
<p>The ordinance establishing the creation of the district will become 
official upon completion of a second reading, which is scheduled to take place 
during the council's next meeting.</p> 
<p>Other business conducted by the council this week included:</p> 
<p>- approval of consolidation of Cornerstone lots 191, 193 and 195 on 
Talisman Drive;</p> 
<p>- approval of an annual State Income Tax Credit Review Authority agreement;
</p> 
<p>- approval of an intergovernmental agreement with the county outlining the 
confidential exchange of sales tax information between the two entities;</p> 
<p>- approval of an intergovernmental agreement with the county indicating the 
entities will split the costs related to upgrades to Cemetery Road.</p>

<p><b>County seeks volunteers for pair of citizens' committees </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County is looking for a few good volunteers.</p> 
<p>At the request of county planning and building department staff Tuesday, 
the board of commissioners authorized the formation and recruitment of two 
citizens' advisory committees - one to provide input on a forthcoming transfer 
of development rights program, and another to address issues concerning outdoor 
lighting regulations.</p> 
<p>With regard to county lighting regulations, Julie Rodriguez, director of 
county development, told commissioners this week that planning staff &quot;has 
determined that possible changes are needed and would like direction from the 
board as to how you would like for us to handle the changes.&quot;</p> 
<p>Based on the number and history of concerns with the county's current 
outdoor lighting code expressed by business owners and private citizens, said 
Rodriguez, it is necessary &quot;to take another look&quot; at the regulations.
</p> 
<p>The regulations were originally created by a citizens' advisory committee 
in 2002 through collaboration with former county planning director Greg 
Comstock, evaluated and recommended by the Upper San Juan Regional Planning 
Commission, then adopted by the board.</p> 
<p>&quot;Planning staff would like to know if the board prefers that we again 
follow this method for changes,&quot; said Rodriguez, &quot;or would prefer 
that staff make the changes, then present them to the planning commission for 
recommendation to the board.&quot;</p> 
<p>In response, Commissioner Alden Ecker moved to direct planning staff to 
advertise for a seven-member citizens' committee to review the regulations 
under the guidance of the planning department.</p> 
<p>The motion carried unanimously, and planning staff later clarified that 
volunteers chosen to review the regulations will not be charged with 
&quot;reinventing the wheel.&quot; </p> 
<p>Marcus Baker, associate county planner, stated the committee's primary 
responsibility will most likely be to provide feedback on &quot;minor changes 
to existing language&quot; in the current outdoor lighting regulations.</p> 
<p>In addition, the board indicated public hearings will be conducted prior to 
the potential adoption of any regulation changes.</p> 
<p><b>'TDR' volunteers sought</b></p> 
<p>In related business, the board approved the pursuit of a committee to 
spearhead the creation of a transfer of development rights program to coincide 
with ongoing efforts to establish new county land-use regulations.</p> 
<p>The following is a press release issued by the county planning department 
which provides further information on the program, as well as details for 
anyone interested in serving on the committee:</p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Planning Department is seeking volunteers to 
participate in a citizens advisory committee for preparing a transfer of 
development rights (TDR) program for use with the future Archuleta County 
Performance Development Code.</p> 
<p>The TDR program would be voluntary for landowners and developers to 
participate in.</p> 
<p>This voluntary program would offer financial incentives to the landowner in 
exchange for the property's development rights.</p> 
<p>The development rights sold by one landowner would be bought by a developer 
or another land owner to allow more intense development in the urban areas.</p> 
<p>In effect, transferring development rights reduces urban sprawl; preserves 
ranchlands, wildlife habitat and open space areas; and compensates land owners 
for conserving portions of their land.</p> 
<p>TDR programs vary around the country, but the planning department would 
like to create a system that works well for the citizens of Archuleta County. 
This is why the planning department needs community participation.</p> 
<p>The planning department would like to assemble a team of citizens that 
consists of developers, a real estate agent, rural land owners, urban land 
owners, town and county government representatives and a member of the local 
Southwest Land Alliance. Others may also be considered.</p> 
<p>This group will meet once a week until a draft of the program is complete 
(12-16 weeks).</p> 
<p>If you are interested in participating in the creation of this program or 
if you simply have questions about the program, please call Marcus Baker at 
264-5851.</p>

<p><b>Voter forum on general election issues Oct. 12 </b></p> 
<p>A commissioner candidate and ballot issues forum preceding the Nov. 2, 
general election will be held Tuesday, Oct. 12, in the Extension building at 
the county fairgrounds. </p> 
<p>The session, sponsored by League of Women Voters of Archuleta County, opens 
with a chance to meet the candidates at 6:30 p.m. followed by the forum at 7.
</p> 
<p>There will be one unopposed candidate for county commissioner in District 
2, Republican Rhonda Zaday; and two candidates for the seat representing 
District 1, Republican Robin Schiro and Independent Nan Rowe.</p> 
<p>In addition, several issues on the ballot will be discussed Oct. 12, 
including local water concerns, statewide initiatives regarding construction 
liability, tobacco tax increases, selection of presidential electors and 
renewable energy requirements as well as referenda for the state personnel 
system and repeal of obsolete constitutional provisions.</p> 
<p>The forum is for information only, and is not a public debate.</p> 
<p>It is open to all county citizens and the format encourages them to meet 
and talk with candidates, and learn their positions, thereby promoting informed 
decision making in the voting booth.</p> 
<p>At the same time, the league suggests those who are tired of negative 
political campaigning use the power of their vote for positive change.</p> 
<p>Members suggest voters support candidates who display leadership, create 
confidence in our system of government and inspire us to think - proactive, not 
reactive.</p> 
<p>How can the voter do these things? </p> 
<p>- Evaluate political materials and advertising carefully. Ask yourself if 
it is positive or negative. Does it give good reasons to vote for a specific 
candidate or does it merely tear down the opponent?</p> 
<p>- Call or write candidates, party leaders and the news media. Protest 
negative campaigning; praise positive efforts.</p> 
<p>- Speak out at public meetings with candidates. Hold them accountable for 
content or lack thereof in their campaign materials, advertising, debates and 
appearances.</p> 
<p>- Support and work for candidates who are represented by campaigns you 
believe are informative, relevant and fair.</p> 
<p>- Vote - and encourage others to vote - for those candidates whose 
campaigns engender confidence in our system of government.</p>

<p><b>Issues studied, school children ready to vote </b></p> 
<p><b>By Windsor Chacey</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Imagine a Pagosa Springs where even the youngest citizens know about the 
coming elections and are excited about their chance to participate.</p> 
<p>A community where everyone from 8 to 80 discusses political issues, knows 
the importance of participating in civic life, is informed, and knows how to be 
an effective participant.</p> 
<p>This is the vision behind Kids Voting Colorado/Pagosa Springs, an 
innovative civic education program now in progress in the Archuleta District 50 
Joint schools.</p> 
<p>Kids Voting is a grassroots, non-partisan, nonprofit organization dedicated 
to increasing civic participation through the education of youth about the 
importance of voting and to increase adult voter turnout. It was created as a 
way to improve the understanding that our youth have about the importance of 
civic life, and to involve adults, businesses and the entire community in that 
process.</p> 
<p>The need for civic education through this program is demonstrated by the 
alarmingly low voter turnout throughout the United States, as well as in 
Colorado, and particularly in our local elections.</p> 
<p>Through interactive activities in the Kids Voting curriculum, kindergarten 
through 12th-grade students develop critical thinking and information gathering 
skills.</p> 
<p>The curriculum does not teach specific information about candidates and 
issues. It focuses on the electoral process, is written by teachers for 
teachers, easily integrated into civics standards as well as other disciplines, 
and taught by the regular classroom teachers.</p> 
<p>Curriculum lessons don't just focus on the voting booth, but mesh well with 
the Colorado Model Content Standards and the CSAP Bench Marks. Many activities 
concentrate on broader civic participation: discussion of what government is 
and how it influences our lives; how citizen involvement shapes public policy; 
how to inform yourself about relevant issues; the importance of running for and 
serving in elected office; the value to the community of volunteering; and most 
importantly, the power of the voting process to sustain the democratic process 
and improve the lives of community members.</p> 
<p>Kids Voting takes learning outside the classroom and gives students a 
simulated election experience. Early in the fall, students register to vote in 
their classes and encourage their parents to register as well. On Election Day, 
students go to their neighborhood polling places with their parents (they do 
not go as a class) and cast their own, special, locally developed ballots at 
their own polling booths assisted by Kids Voting volunteers. </p> 
<p>The results of the students' election are reported through local news 
media. With Kids Voting, adults not only vote in higher numbers, but they 
volunteer at the polls, talk to students about the elections, and become more 
involved citizens themselves.</p> 
<p>The program is implemented by a Kids Voting steering committee of 
community, business, education leaders and volunteers. This group raises funds, 
supports the participation of the schools, organizes and recruits volunteers to 
staff the polls, and helps to increase community awareness and involvement in 
the electoral process.</p> 
<p>The Kids Voting program is provided to the schools at no cost and is funded 
through the generosity of local organizations and businesses such as Rotary, 
Kiwanis, Bank of the San Juans, 1st Southwest Bank, La Plata Electric, Rio 
Grande Savings and Loan, Wells Fargo, and the League of Women Voters of 
Archuleta County.</p>

District rejected a sewer maintenance proposal Tuesday from Harman Park 
Subdivision.</p> 
<p>The board, which is comprised of members of the town council, based its 
denial of the request on the fact Harman Park's sewer system is intended to be 
pressurized.</p> 
<p>Because of the potential problems that could develop were the district to 
accept such a system, &quot;a pressured sewer service in this subdivision is 
one that should not be assumed for maintenance purposes by the district,&quot; 
said Phil Starks, sanitation district supervisor.</p> 
<p>A review of the subdivision's proposal in reports issued by Briliam 
Engineering echo such sentiments, recommending &quot;a final gravity sewer 
system design and specifications be developed (by Harman Park) for final review 
and approval prior to the construction of the system.&quot;</p> 
<p>If Harman Park opts to continue development of a pressurized system, the 
subdivision will be required to follow Colorado Department of Public Health and 
Environment regulations regarding operations of a &quot;satellite system.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The system could then be connected to the district's existing gravity 
system after final approval by the district board.</p> 
<p>In related business, Starks reported no violations concerning the operation 
of district lagoons for the month of September.</p> 
<p>In addition, no clogs or spills affected the district collection system 
last month, said Starks.</p> 
<p>Proposed projects identified in Stark's report Tuesday included 
consideration of upgrades to the east U.S. 160 main line extension, upgrade 
consideration for the main line between South 5th and South 6th streets and a 
pending analysis of the district collection system involving global-positioning 
system mapping.</p> 
<p>Rate structure</p> 
<p>After a public hearing that lasted roughly one minute Tuesday because there 
were no comments from the public, the board took no action on the proposed, new 
district rate structure.</p> 
<p>According to directors, the issue will likely be revisited during the 
board's next regular meeting. </p>

<p><b>Participants sought for county land-use survey </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Be heard.</p> 
<p>For the next four weeks, Archuleta County residents can have a direct 
impact on the future of their land-use regulations by participating in an 
online survey being conducted by the county planning department.</p> 
<p>The survey has been available for completion and submittal on the county's 
Web site since last weekend. </p> 
<p>In order to complete and submit the survey, residents should go to 
www.archuletacounty.org and click on the link near the bottom of the page 
titled &quot;survey,&quot; then follow the instructions provided.</p> 
<p>The county is encouraging maximum participation in the survey process, and 
public workshops will be conducted in order to provide additional survey 
information and address related questions.</p> 
<p>The first workshop is scheduled to take place in the Vista Clubhouse Oct. 
20, 7 p.m.</p> 
<p>The second workshop is set for Oct. 28, 7 p.m. inside the county Extension 
building.</p> 
<p>Though the preference is to have as many residents as possible complete the 
survey online, all county residents are eligible and strongly encouraged to 
participate in the survey, whether or not they have Internet service available. 
</p> 
<p>Residents who would like to fill out hard copies of the survey can obtain 
them at the county planning department, 527 A San Juan St.</p> 
<p>Until the completion deadline of Nov. 5, 4 p.m., surveys will also be 
distributed at the county commissioners' office, county clerk's office, county 
Extension building, Arboles Store, Chimney Rock Restaurant, Chromo Mercantile, 
Pagosa Springs Post Office, Ruby Sisson Library, Turkey Springs Trading Post 
and the Silver Foxes Den Senior Center (inside the community center). </p> 
<p>Surveys are also expected to be available near polling locations during 
this year's Nov. 2 general election.</p> 
<p>Completed surveys can be submitted at the following locations: county 
planning office, county clerk's office, Arboles Store, Chimney Rock Restaurant, 
Chromo Mercantile, Ruby Sisson Library and Turkey Springs Trading Post.</p> 
<p>Residents can also request surveys be mailed to their households by calling 
the planning department office at 264-5851 or 264-4785.</p> 
<p><b>General information</b> </p> 
<p>In summary, the survey asks residents to assign specific values to a list 
of &quot;performance criteria&quot; that will be used to evaluate future 
development proposals within five respective, geographic areas of the county 
described as &quot;planning districts.&quot;</p> 
<p>Though subject to change, the five districts currently proposed are: 
Southwest District (including Arboles), Southeast District (including Chromo 
and the Upper/Lower Blanco areas), Northeast District (including Loma Linda, 
and Holiday Acres), Northwest District (including Aspen Springs and Chimney 
Rock) and Pagosa Lakes District.</p> 
<p>The main objective of the survey is to aid the ongoing development of an 
entirely new county land-use code that began last August.</p> 
<p>The new, performance-based code will eventually replace existing 
regulations and, as survey instructions point out, is intended to be based on 
two sets of design standards that will factor heavily in the county's review, 
approval or disapproval of new development initiatives within each planning 
district.</p> 
<p>The two sets of design standards to be considered in the survey are 
identified as &quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; standards.</p> 
<p>&quot;Absolute&quot; standards are proposed as &quot;concrete rules for new 
development that must be complied with&quot; - mandatory requirements to be met 
in all cases except those in which a variance is requested by the developer and 
granted by the county commissioners.</p> 
<p>&quot;Relative&quot; standards are &quot;criteria in the new code that 
would be encouraged or discouraged&quot; to allow flexibility in the design of 
a new project, but not required. </p> 
<p>Questions in the survey ask residents to consider if the range of items 
listed, or &quot;performance standards,&quot; should be designated as absolute 
standards or relative standards.</p> 
<p>Some examples of performance standards residents are asked to consider 
include &quot;avoiding commercial and industrial development over 20,000 square 
feet&quot; and &quot;designating critical wildlife habitat to be in open 
space.&quot;</p> 
<p>Survey questions are separated into two parts, &quot;Step 1&quot; and 
&quot;Step 2.&quot;</p> 
<p>Step 1 begins with the question of whether or not the individual filling 
out the survey believes the performance standard listed should be designated as 
an absolute standard - a requirement.</p> 
<p>In Step 1, the individual is asked to circle either &quot;yes&quot; or 
&quot;no.&quot;</p> 
<p>For example, one question asks residents to decide if &quot;locating new 
gravel pits to minimize visual and environmental impacts&quot; should be 
designated an absolute standard.</p> 
<p>If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; meaning the participant believes locating 
new gravel pits to minimize visual and environmental impacts should be a an 
absolute standard required of developers, the participant moves on to the next 
question. </p> 
<p>Should the answer be &quot;no,&quot; meaning the participant does not 
believe such, he or she moves on to Step 2 of the question, which requires the 
participant to assign an importance value to the standard by circling a number 
from 1 to 5, with 5 being most important and 1 being least important.</p> 
<p>If the participant answers &quot;no&quot; and circles &quot;5,&quot; for 
example, he or she is stating that the standard listed should be designated a 
relative standard that is highly encouraged by the county, but not required.</p>
<p>If &quot;2&quot; is circled, in effect the participant is saying it is 
important that the standard in question should be somewhat encouraged, but not 
required.</p>

instructions, contact the planning department Monday-Friday between 8 a.m. and 
4 p.m. </p>

<p><b>Pirate sports fans face bevy of road projects getting to games </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Those planning to attend the Pagosa Pirate's soccer game Friday in Crested 
Butte - and to a lesser degree those heading to the prep football showdown in 
Monte Vista and the Fowler volleyball tournament - should be aware of potential 
delays en route.</p> 
<p>Not only are the three projects on Wolf Creek Pass still underway, soccer 
fans may also encounter additional delays on the west side of Cochetopa Pass 
between Saguache and Gunnison.</p> 
<p>And, Colorado Department of Transportation lists another project that could 
cause delays in the Town of Almont between Gunnison and Crested Butte.</p> 
<p>One thing they, football and volleyball fans won't have to worry about is 
the overnight closings of Wolf Creek - they are in effect 10 p.m.-5 a.m. Monday 
through Thursday in conjunction with the Lonesome Dove to Windy Point project 
at the east base of the pass.</p> 
<p>Still, ongoing blasting and stone removal could lead to delays in that 
project strip of 30 minutes or more.</p> 
<p>Also underway on Wolf Creek, but nearing completion, with only minor delays 
expected, are the paving project on the west side from Treasure Falls upward; 
and the tunnel project on the west side where equipment maneuvering could cause 
delays.</p> 
<p>Once off Wolf Creek, soccer fans - but not those going to Monte Vista or 
Fowler - can anticipate more delays on a 10-mile stretch of Cochetopa Pass' 
west side (milemarkers 19-29) where resurfacing is underway. A 10-foot width 
restriction is in effect.</p> 
<p>The Almont project on Colo. 135 (mileposts 5.8-6.1) involves reconstruction 
and safety improvements with delays possible 6:30 a.m.-7 p.m.</p> 
<p>Weather permitting, contractors say, there could be additional pass 
closures on Wolf Creek throughout October. For updated schedule information 
each week, call the hotline at (719) 850-2553.</p> 
<p>For Friday, our advice is leave early, pack a lunch, take a radio and a 
good book - and drive carefully. </p>

<p><b>Four-part game hunting season opens Saturday </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>You've seen them in the wild - scoping out the likely locations.</p> 
<p>Hunters. </p> 
<p>Hunters in camo. </p> 
<p>Hunters on four-wheelers and hunters looking for the best camp sites.</p> 
<p>They're poised to invade the area with, perhaps, two thoughts in mind: Meat 
for the winter table or a trophy rack to hang over the fireplace.</p> 
<p>While all this preparation was going on, the deer and elk seemed immune to 
the threat.</p> 
<p>Almost daily deer could be seen on the fringes of Four Corners communities, 
some venturing right into town.</p> 
<p>And within 20 miles of Pagosa Springs in almost any direction, elk seemed 
to be gathering to lay evasion plans for the hunter invasion.</p> 
<p>Mother Nature has done her part, delivering snow in the higher elevations 
and heavy rains in lower areas making the fall grasses green up and grow to 
provide forage for the wildlife.</p> 
<p>Hunters regard the high-country snows as a benefit in tracking, but the 
elusive game are generally scouting out their own refuges when they see the 
influx of hunters scoping the range.</p> 
<p>What are we looking for as the annual confrontation begins?</p> 
<p>- Limited (by draw only) elk season opens Saturday, Oct. 9, and continues 
through Wednesday, Oct. 13. </p> 
<p>- Over-the-counter combined deer and elk season will be Saturday, Oct. 16, 
through Sunday, Oct. 24. </p> 
<p>- The third season, combined for deer and elk, opens Saturday, Oct. 30 and 
continues through Friday, Nov. 5.</p> 
<p>- The last of the four fall seasons, a limited hunt for both elk and deer, 
opens Saturday, Nov. 6, and continues through Wednesday, Nov. 10.</p> 
<p>Wildlife officials say there is a somewhat larger than average deer and elk 
supply in the regional hunting units and most expect an excellent culling if 
the weather holds. </p>

<p><b>Mighty Wapiti raise a racket near camp</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Darkness lingered as I crawled out of the tent, and the calm early-morning 
air, while still crisp, felt much warmer than expected. Glancing upward, I was 
certain thick clouds were responsible for the curious clemency, but only a few 
lenticulars stretched over the glowing eastern horizon and high snowy peaks to 
the south. Meanwhile, the prominent stars of Orion shone brightly overhead, 
and, as they had all night long, bull elk in the surrounding forest continued 
their incessant bugling.</p> 
<p>We were camped for a long weekend on a friend's property atop the 
Uncompahgre Plateau, and this year, Jackie and I joined Bob, the land owner, 
our nephew, Mike, and my brother and sister-in-law, Jim and Sue. It was 
mid-September, and, as in most years, we were there to witness changing fall 
colors, and the gathering frenzy of rutting elk.</p> 
<p>The property is one of a handful of 40-acre parcels in a quiet and secluded 
subdivision far up the plateau from Montrose. The development is largely 
surrounded by national forest, and roads are primitive, with no winter 
maintenance. Over the years, only a few modest cabins (including Bob's simple 
&quot;hunter's&quot; cabin) have been added to the wooded and mostly untamed 
landscape, and for some time, area deer and elk hunting have been limited to 
special draw. Consequently, both species seem larger and more numerous with 
every passing season.</p> 
<p>The hunter's cabin sits near the southeast corner of Bob's 40 acres, and 
its wooden deck overlooks a vast open meadow to the south. Further south, just 
beyond the meadow, the lofty peaks of the San Juan and San Miguel mountains 
loom, and just prior to this particular weekend, recent inclement weather had 
deposited a fresh blanket of snow over their higher reaches. Meanwhile, to the 
north, east, and west, a thick forest of aspen and Ponderosa pine covers much 
of the countryside, and upon our arrival, splendid shades of green, yellow, and 
orange were in full glory.</p> 
<p>I hadn't slept on the ground for about 10 years, but because this year 
marked the fifth anniversary of Jim and Sue's wedding at the property, the 
cabin's quaint sleeping arrangements were reserved for them. In consideration, 
Mike curled up in the back of his SUV, as Bob found sufficient shelter in his 
pickup camper.</p> 
<p>Our new dome tent, on the other hand, offered extraordinary comfort, 
particularly with three-inch foam pads and zip-together sleeping bags added in. 
In anticipation of frigid nighttime temperatures, we threw in extra blankets 
and stocking hats, but both nights were unusually mild, and we never needed 
them.</p> 
<p>For a little privacy and sense of adventure, and of course, an increased 
likelihood of overhearing the raucous behavior of propagating elk, we chose to 
set the tent a couple of hundred yards northwest of the cabin. There, in the 
thick of the forest, and closer to a ridge where the preponderance of bugling 
seemed to originate, we made camp. For two solitary evenings, with the tent 
neatly erect, our pads and bags efficiently aligned, and a propane lantern 
illuminating our path from cabin to tent, we found comfort and security in an 
otherwise dark and somewhat mystical environment.</p> 
<p>It was early that first morning, as I stood in the predawn darkness beneath 
the mighty hunter, Orion, that I wondered if anyone else had awakened and might 
be up for a walk. Jackie remained snug in her bag, but it was still too dark to 
see if anyone else had stirred, and I couldn't hear any human activity because, 
as mentioned, the elk were really carrying on, with most of the racket now 
apparently coming from the meadow just beyond the trees. I knew within minutes, 
the first light of day would flood into the clearing, sending any elk out there 
quickly retreating to the relative safety of the surrounding forest. So I 
buttoned my jacket, grabbed my binoculars from the Jeep, and cautiously 
sauntered through the aspens toward open terrain, and what sounded like a 
developing clash among opposing monarchs.</p> 
<p>I stopped a hundred yards from the clearing, and glassed the area to see if 
I could locate any game. There was still barely enough light to see, but 
nevertheless, while scanning left to right, a dark solitary figure suddenly 
materialized in my field of view. It was a magnificent bull, still a fair 
distance beyond the trees, but as he swaggered back and forth, I could vividly 
distinguish six symmetrical points on either side of a hefty rack. Meanwhile, 
continued screening gradually revealed a dozen cows and calves in the great 
stag's presence, and at once, all appeared to be moving in my direction.</p> 
<p>More clouds slowly gathered, as the eastern horizon grew steadily brighter. 
The grand summits to the south, with their vast, pure white snowfields, stood 
in sharp contrast to the yet-obscure conifer forests dressing their lower 
flanks. A steady breeze had developed, and millions of golden leaves trembled 
in the branches above. Many broke loose under the unbearable strain, ultimately 
tumbling to the forest floor below.</p> 
<p>As the elk warily drew closer, I took advantage of what low light remained, 
and quietly edged nearer the brink of the meadow. In a moment, with but a small 
clump of aspens between me and open ground, I glassed them again. They were 
much closer now, and the bull seemed the size of a draft horse. His antlers 
were massive, yet he carried them as if they weighed nothing. Bold and 
confident, his authority was obvious, as he constantly kept vigil over his 
self-possessed harem.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, dawn was at hand, and the clouds in the east took on vivid 
shades of purple, then fuchsia, and finally a rosy-orange. Within minutes, the 
majestic peaks were aflame with the same colors of the sky, and unexpectedly, 
an unseen pack of coyotes let loose with a loud and boisterous clamor that 
briefly rivaled the shrill cries of other nearby bulls.</p> 
<p>I watched in amazement, as the band of elk progressively approached the 
small clump of aspens now separating me from them. Not a hundred yards off, 
loud and animated bugling echoed over the meadow, but strangely, as I focused 
on the group's master, it wasn't coming from him. Just then, another great 
bull, with only a few cows and calves in tow, emerged from a low-lying 
depression further out in the meadow. Heretofore unseen, it was he who made all 
the commotion, as he came prancing onto the scene.</p> 
<p>Both groups merged as they entered the aspen thicket, with the first great 
monarch clearly agitated by the presence of his rival, and the second 
frenetically challenging the other. The cows and calves appeared oblivious to 
it all, as they ignored the unruly contention in favor of periodic grazing. </p>
<p>It wasn't until they actually penetrated the small aspen grove that I 
realized the elk, including two very disconcerted bulls, stood only about a 
hundred feet from me. I glanced around, and promptly recognized a clear and 
present danger, with nothing but a few trees shielding me from a surprised and 
angry bull, should one decide to charge. At that instant I pronounced a sharp 
&quot;hiss,&quot; to which the lead cow immediately froze, contemplated for a 
moment, then abruptly turned and trotted off.</p> 
<p>Within seconds, the entire group ran south, and eventually veered west into 
the cover of the forest. That quickly, a potential threat was gone, and so was 
a most dramatic encounter with the great American Wapiti.</p>

<p><b>DOW seeking wildlife manager recruits </b></p> 
<p>Colorado Division of Wildlife human resources personnel and wildlife 
officers will soon travel around the state as part of the agency's annual 
recruitment and hiring efforts, seeking individuals who are interested in 
applying for wildlife manager positions.</p> 
<p>For the past four years, DOW representatives have organized public 
presentations to discuss the testing and hiring process for entry-level 
wildlife manager positions. This year, they will be available for questions at 
a dozen recruiting sessions around the state. Speakers will explain minimum 
qualifications, the testing process, types of tests given, how to prepare for 
tests, wildlife officer job duties, and what to expect during the first year of 
training.</p> 
<p>&quot;For the past several years, almost everyone hired as a wildlife 
manager attended one of our presentations,&quot; said DOW human resources 
manager Gary Berlin, who attends the sessions every year. &quot;We pack an 
incredible amount of information into the 90-minute presentations.&quot;</p> 
<p>The DOW has a rich tradition of recruiting talented and dedicated 
professionals to manage Colorado's wildlife resources. In working to maintain 
this tradition, the hiring process for this entry-level position is very 
competitive. Anyone interested in applying for these positions must meet the 
minimum qualifications: a degree in natural resources or a related degree in 
biology, wildlife management, environmental science, range management or 
zoology.</p> 
<p>It's not uncommon for individuals to test several times before receiving a 
permanent job offer. Those interested in applying for a wildlife manager 
position are strongly encouraged to attend a presentation to hear from the 
experts, including veteran wildlife managers.</p> 
<p>&quot;District wildlife managers are an important part of the presentations 
as they share their personal experiences with the testing process. Some even 
remember the questions from the year they tested. They provide great insight 
into a pretty competitive selection process,&quot; said Rita Laitres, a human 
resources specialist at the DOW who also attends the sessions every year.</p> 
<p>Laitres stressed that a good strategy to successfully maneuver through the 
intensive testing process would be to attend one of the many recruitment 
presentations scheduled in October and November. Many current wildlife trainees 
agreed. </p> 
<p>&quot;I made a point to attend one of the presentations,&quot; said 
wildlife manager trainee Cory Chick, who graduated from Adams State College 
this year. &quot;It really helped to talk with Rod Ruybalid, district wildlife 
manager in Conejos, to understand the demands of the job.&quot;</p> 
<p>John Groves, a 2002 Mesa State College graduate and wildlife manager 
trainee, said the recruitment sessions helped familiarize him with the state 
hiring process.</p> 
<p>&quot;I learned where to find the job announcement on the state Web site, 
the minimum qualifications, and the four-step testing process,&quot; he said.
</p> 
<p>Stephanie Schuler, a wildlife manager trainee, said she took the 
presenters' advice to heart when they stressed the importance of studying the 
DOW Web site.</p> 
<p>&quot;It really prepared me for the testing process,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>Zach Holder, a wildlife manager trainee and the son of district wildlife 
manager Bob Holder of Trinidad, said he practically grew up in the DOW and 
knows all about the position. Even so, he found it valuable to attend one of 
the recruitment sessions.</p> 
<p>&quot;In the presentation they stress the demands of the wildlife manager 
position and people learn that the position is a multi-purpose one. It's not 
just a law enforcement job,&quot; Holder said.</p> 
<p>Jason Duetsch, a 2004 Colorado State University graduate and a current 
wildlife manager trainee, said he appreciated spending an evening with 
knowledgeable people who could answer his questions.</p> 
<p>&quot;After the presentation was over the presenters were more than happy 
to stay and answer all our questions. It was nice to receive that kind of 
attention from professionals who care,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Crystal Petersen, a 2002 Western State College graduate, added, &quot;I 
already had great temporary field experience with the Division, but the 
presentation offered valuable studying tips and an in-depth explanation of the 
first year on the job.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Forest thinning, burns could affect the hunt </b></p> 
<p>Several projects are underway on San Juan Public Lands that may affect 
hunters.</p> 
<p>These projects are on both San Juan National Forest and Bureau of Land 
Management-San Juan Field Office lands and are expected to last throughout the 
rifle seasons, unless otherwise noted.</p> 
<p>The projects may include thinning trees and shrubs by hand with chainsaws 
or with a hydromower or hydroaxe - large tractor-like machines with attachments 
that turn shrubs and trees into mulch - and then leave a layer of mulched 
vegetation on the ground to retain moisture and help prevent erosion.</p> 
<p>The obvious reason for notifying hunters of these project areas is the 
noise generated by these activities; the second reason is safety.</p> 
<p>Debris generated by the hydromowers may travel up to 300 feet. Hunters who 
hear or see these machines should keep a safe distance away.</p> 
<p>In addition to helping slow a wildfire's progress and lessen its intensity, 
these thinning projects will also improve wildlife forage and habitat. New 
shrubs and grasses that come up following treatments are much more palatable to 
animals. </p> 
<p>If conditions are right, some prescribed burns may also occur this fall to 
reduce undergrowth and ground fuels and restore fire to the ecosystem.</p> 
<p>Since prescribed fires are dependent on a number of conditions being met, 
it is hard to predict when these burns may occur. Announcements will be made in 
local media prior to ignition.</p> 
<p>Unless otherwise noted all projects are expected to run throughout the 
entire hunting season. From east to west, the projects are:</p>

<p><b>Kerry impresses</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I was very impressed by John Kerry at the first presidential debate Sept. 
30.</p> 
<p>Kerry seemed to have a clear plan for the Iraq war, for integrating our 
allies, for generating a more democratic process there and for bringing our 
troops back home more safely.</p> 
<p>George Bush continued to display his lack of intelligence, his evasion of 
the truth and his quick temper.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Opinion changed</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The following &quot;Opinion of the Publishers&quot; says it clearly:</p> 
<p>&quot;Few Americans would have voted for George W. Bush four years ago if 
he had promised that, as president, he would:</p> 
<p>- empty the Social Security trust fund by $507 billion to help offset 
fiscal irresponsibility and at the same time slash Social Security benefits;</p>
<p>- cut Medicare by 17 percent and reduce veterans' benefits and military pay;
</p> 
<p>- eliminate overtime pay for millions of Americans and raise oil prices by 
50 percent;</p> 
<p>- give tax cuts to business then send jobs overseas, and, in fact, by 
policy encourage their departure;</p> 
<p>- give away billions of tax dollars in government contracts without 
competitive bids;</p> 
<p>- involve this country in a deadly and highly questionable war; and</p> 
<p>- take a budget surplus and turn it into the worst deficit in the history 
of the United States, creating a debt in just four years that will take 
generations to pay.</p> 
<p>&quot;These were the elements of a hidden agenda that surfaced only after 
he took office. The publishers endorsed Bush four years ago, based on the 
things he promised, not on this smoke-screened agenda.</p> 
<p>&quot;Today we are endorsing his opponent, John Kerry, based not only on 
the things that Bush has delivered, but also on the vision of a return to 
normality.&quot;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Silence cowardly</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I normally believe a person's political views are their own, not to be 
intruded upon. However, for me to remain silent at such a crucial time in our 
country's history would amount to cowardice.</p> 
<p>After having watched the current administration over the last four years, I 
fear for our country, for the very freedom we cherish and for the future of the 
world.</p> 
<p>America has been ill-used by this administration and the President's 
self-serving goals. Our stature in the eyes of the world is at an all time low, 
our geopolitical policies reprehensible, our economy in ruins, and our 
integrity and honesty as a world power the object of scorn and contempt.</p> 
<p>It's not merely Iraq, the economy, pandering to big business, the 
abolishment of laws and policies enacted to safeguard our health and 
environment, human rights or our role in world affairs, but a question of the 
honesty, forthrightness, openness and integrity with which the United States 
Government conducts itself both at home and abroad.</p> 
<p>America can no longer act unilaterally with impunity. The rights we 
citizens have given up in the name of homeland security are the very rights the 
founding fathers deemed most sacred and the very rights for which so many 
Americans have fought and died.</p> 
<p>Our government must honor its commitments, hold itself accountable for its 
actions and recognize and honorably fulfill its role in the global community. 
We must lead by example, not merely through force. Our obligation is to the 
future.</p> 
<p>The Lone Star Iconoclast, Crawford, Texas' local newspaper, the President's 
hometown paper, and a newspaper that endorsed the current president four years 
ago, has endorsed John Kerry and John Edwards &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; (you 
can read the endorsement at www.iconoclast-texas.com). For a newspaper to turn 
its back on a homegrown hero speaks volumes about that person.</p> 
<p>I am convinced John Kerry and John Edwards will pursue a positive, 
productive, honest and safe direction for the United States and for all 
countries embracing freedom.</p> 
<p>On election day it will be just you and God in the voting booth. It is no 
else's business how you vote, but remember how much there is at stake.</p> 
<p>Please consider our country's dilemma when you go to the polls and vote for 
the new leadership we need.</p> 
<p>Thanks for listening to me.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Rules broken</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>President Bush was in a position of defending our country at the same time 
debating someone who has consistently and systematically betrayed our country 
in deference to all other countries of the world.</p> 
<p>Kerry has missed 76 percent of the Intelligence Committee meetings. This is 
not very intelligent, and it means he knows nothing about our country's 
intelligence. He'll hand our country over to the UN and then party. This is why 
President Bush says he's involved in hard work. He's trying to clean up the 
mess caused by negligent senators such as Kerry.</p> 
<p>Kerry said with obvious gestures that he'd bring allies over by paying them 
off. This is corruption in full bloom right on prime time TV and when 95 
percent of the Muslim world would rather have Kerry than Bush, this should tell 
the American people all they need to know.</p> 
<p>Sen. Unwilted Botox said he couldn't handle two battles at once. Any CEO 
can handle a multitude of items at the same time. He's not qualified for the 
job since being president requires somebody who can consider more than one 
thing at a time.</p> 
<p>Jim Lehrer asked questions meant to put Bush in a corner. There should have 
been a second moderator to ask questions that would make Kerry squirm instead 
of smile. Since the questions were slanted, the moderation should have been 
split.</p> 
<p>Toward the end Kerry broke the rules of the so-called debate by mentioning 
the so-called sciences of global warming and stem cell research; therefore, 
President Bush won by default alone. These were supposed to be for the next two 
debates. I'll help us out right now by saying that global warming, which 
doesn't even matter, is a Marxist device to economically control the masses. 
Stem cell research just fattens the industry of institutional premeditated mass 
murder which is abortion. They should work on something positive, such as 
getting synthetic blood to be more effective. The government is under no 
obligation to research pipe dreams, anyway.</p> 
<p>Also for the next debate, since Kerry is filthy rich and has never worked a 
day in his life, he has no business talking about jobs and the economy. He 
really means the government's economy, not the peoples' economy. Let's make 
this distinction. His kind has taxed, sued, and regulated businesses out of 
this country and now he's going to fix the damage caused?</p> 
<p>Some people keep grousing about how Bush has spent more money than anybody 
else in history, but it takes a lot of money to fix what the extremist 
Democrats have caused while they've lied and partied. We finally have a leader 
who works and the Dems just can't stand this.</p> 
<p>Regardless of whether or not this passes the &quot;global test&quot; I'll 
state that the economy and terrorism are directly linked whether somebody likes 
it or not; therefore, the debate wasn't set up correctly on this point either 
and neither will be the next debate.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>'Big box' beltway</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I read with great interest the recent front page article regarding large 
box stores coming to Pagosa Springs. While I do not live in your great town, I 
felt compelled to write. You see I live in the beltway of Wal-Mart. I live in 
Arkansas.</p> 
<p>The question is &quot;Do you want Pagosa Springs to dramatically change its 
current environment?&quot;</p> 
<p>Wal-Mart will bring low prices. But, in exchange, it will result in the 
closure of grocery stores, optical shops, beauty salons, hardware stores, 
produce markets and even some automotive shops. I can give you a list of 75 
towns in Arkansas which were quaint little towns whose very existence was 
changed by a Wal-Mart. The decision is yours to make in Pagosa Springs. Free 
enterprise is the backbone of our economy.</p> 
<p>However, do not think you can decipher a way for your current businesses to 
coexist with a Wal-Mart or any other large box store. It can only be done if 
your current shopkeepers are willing to take a substantial, and I mean 
substantial, loss of business which ultimately will result in their stores 
closing.</p> 
<p>I love your town. It is a dream for me to live there when I retire. I know 
it has its troubles. But it is Mayberry to those of us who have had the luck to 
visit. Regardless, I will be back. I just hope the folks who built your town 
will still be there.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Domestic woe </b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The recent debate gave us some insights into the foreign policy attitudes 
of President Bush.</p> 
<p>Iraq is headed in the direction of Vietnam with brave men and women 
sacrificing for an ill-conceived and poorly planned war. Hopefully a Kerry 
administration can bring Iraq back for the brink of disaster.</p> 
<p>My concern is President Bush's domestic policies.</p> 
<p>The Bush administration's desire to privatize Social Security makes no 
sense. My mother lost $50,000 of her $150,000 life savings due to bad advice 
from her &quot;investment advisor.&quot; She receives $550 per month in Social 
Security. If that had been privatized she would be receiving $350 per month.</p>
<p>The Bush administration needs to get serious about Social Security, 
national health care, outsourcing of jobs and the discredited &quot;stay the 
wrong course&quot; solution for Iraq.</p> 
<p>The Bush-driven national debt is saddling our children and grandchildren 
with an unconscionable burden. How can business thrive and people borrow to own 
a home if they have to compete with the U.S. Government?</p> 
<p>The world situation is not a movie and President Bush is not John Wayne. We 
need a thoughtful person who can lead the United States and mend fences with 
our allies so we can have a stable, viable and democratic Iraq. We need a 
common sense approach to domestic issues as well.</p> 
<p>My vote is for Kerry-Edwards, John Salazar for U.S. Representative and Ken 
Salazar for U.S. Senate.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>'Big box' benefits</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I just read the article on the possibilities of bringing in a &quot;big 
box&quot; retail store to Pagosa Springs. My husband and I have visited your 
town yearly for the past seven years and own residential property there.</p> 
<p>Every time we visit we stop in Cortez or Durango to shop prior to our 
arrival in Pagosa Springs. Why, you ask? Bigger variety and better prices.</p> 
<p>We are 27-year residents of Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and have seen the 
benefits of &quot;big box&quot; retail stores. For years we traveled anywhere 
from 60 miles (Kingman, Ariz.) to 150 miles (Las Vegas, Nev.) to shop for our 
children when they were in need of school clothes and other items we couldn't 
financially afford in specialty shops in town. Finally someone realized that a 
large percentage of tax dollars was being spent out-of-town and out-of-state.
</p> 
<p>First came Kmart then came Wal-Mart and soon those out-of-town trips came 
to halt. Not only were tax dollars staying in town, but the retailers gave back 
to the community in return.</p> 
<p>I have been employed with the parks and recreation department for almost 19 
years and I cannot begin to tell you the dollar value of the donations we as a 
department have received from these &quot;big box&quot; retail stores.</p> 
<p>The children of our community have enjoyed everything from bicycle 
giveaways to candy and prize donations for our yearly Fall Fun Fair. In 
addition these retail stores sponsor a variety of major events on a yearly 
ranging from Teen Break to our Youth Fishing Derby. And, it's not only the 
youth that benefit - these retailers also sponsor events held for our senior 
population and contribute to citywide organizations that benefit cancer 
victims, youth at risk, the homeless, the humane society and many more.</p> 
<p>Additional litter - not apparent here, and employees of these large retail 
stores play an active role in our community clean-up programs. Yes, smaller 
specialty stores have lost some business, but for the most part businesses have 
continued to thrive by continuing to serve the needs of the community and by 
providing the customer service consumers expect.</p> 
<p>This is just a small example of what having a &quot;big box&quot; retail 
store can do for your community. So before you make a decision one way or the 
other I would hope that you weigh the good against the bad. I'm sure you'll 
find that the positives will outweigh the negatives in the long run.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Campaign vandals </b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I have always considered myself a rather open minded person and I am 
willing to listen to other people's opinions. Naturally I assumed that others 
would have the respect to listen to my opinions.</p> 
<p>Well you know what they say about assuming. Just this Friday some signs we 
had in our yard were stolen and later found torn up in the road. Once again I 
must assume that this was done because these signs supported the Democratic 
Kerry-Edwards team.</p> 
<p>This is an outrageous thing for someone to do. Not only did they trespass 
on our property they destroyed our personal belongings and placed a Bush-Cheney 
sign in its place, something that we certainly did not want.</p> 
<p>At first I decided not to get all riled up about this until it was brought 
to my attention that some friends of ours had the same thing happen only to a 
larger extent. Their house was toilet papered and egged as well.</p> 
<p>What kind of America do I find myself living in?</p> 
<p>I had thought everyone, no matter their station, was entitled to having 
their opinions and to share them. I guess I was wrong. Is this what it's all 
come down to? Has the freedom of expression been ripped down to stupid 
Halloween like pranks? In short I would just like to say to whomever it was 
that felt compelled to do this, if you don't like someone's opinion, fine, talk 
to people or write to them about it.</p> 
<p>Don't degrade yourself by sneaking around in the night and vandalizing 
their personal property. As hard as it may be to drive by that sign or look at 
that bumper sticker hold yourself back. Just be civil.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>No testosterone</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Does anyone honestly have to guess at what would happen should a liberal 
Democrat win the White House?</p> 
<p>There is a record. We know what the Clinton Administration did regarding 
terrorism: Diddlysquat. How many terrorist attacks were there? The first World 
Trade Center bombing, Khobar Towers, the USS Cole. In fact, shortly after the 
first Trade Center attack, Clinton warned Americans not to 
&quot;overreact.&quot; We cut and ran from Mogadishu. We refused to take Osama 
bin Laden when he was offered to us three times by the Sudanese.</p> 
<p>Very little has changed in the liberal mindset. Despite the evidence of 
virulent global enemies - in Russia, Spain, Indonesia, the Middle East and 
elsewhere, the Democrat reaction is to pretend terrorism is not happening. 
Unless they can blame President Bush, they don't want to talk about it. They 
would much rather change the subject to health care, the economy, Social 
Security - anything but the war on terror. They want you to think terrorism 
isn't serious, that the Bush administration is basically making the whole thing 
up.</p> 
<p>There can be little doubt. The modern Democratic Party has a deep distaste 
for any projection of American strength. The left will not act, because they 
believe preemption is provocative. They can't fathom the need for any 
anticipatory defense of the country. They believe John Kerry's phony 
&quot;global test&quot; should come first. Guess it's time to resume pumping 
more holes into Kerry's &quot;Swiftboat&quot; of false colors.</p> 
<p>The Democratic Party today is controlled by a bunch of 1960s anti-war 
activists. Their ideology is anti-defense. They oppose military preemption; 
they oppose the Patriot Act; they oppose military tribunals; they oppose 
virtually every tool that strengthens our security at home and abroad. This is 
the stark difference between Bush and Kerry, between the Republican Party and 
the Democratic Party today, and it's why it is inarguable that George Bush will 
keep this country safer than would John Kerry. It's not because Kerry is 
un-American, it's because he's a liberal. He rejects American superiority. He 
thinks we need to subordinate our power to the rest of the world. But a strong 
America benefits the whole world. It's called spreading liberty. It's called 
enhancing freedom.</p> 
<p>Presently, there is a straightforward way to define the Bush Doctrine: 
countless might call it the testosterone presidency. Republicans have worked 
very hard making Bush look like Gary Cooper in &quot;High Noon.&quot; Why? Men 
have testosterone. Does that necessarily make good policy? No, of course not.
</p> 
<p>Realistically, it makes absolutely great policy. In less than three years, 
the president has smashed the Taliban, scattered and battered al Queda, jailed 
Saddam, and driven Moammar Ghadafi to give up his nuclear weapons program. 
Hunted terrorists are on the run - everywhere.</p>

<p>If you haven't found your Lederhosen and polka duds yet, it's time to start 
looking for them.</p> 
<p>This year's event will be bigger and better than ever, with lower prices 
and more food than last year. You can plan on a full evening of entertainment 
for the whole family, and catch up with those friends you haven't seen 
throughout the busy summer.</p> 
<p>There will be polkas aplenty with your favorite oompah band playing such 
favorites as Arthur Godfrey's &quot;Too Fat Polka&quot; and the traditional 
&quot;Ach, du lieber Augustin.&quot;</p> 
<p>Of course, many people show up to learn the &quot;Chicken Dance,&quot; and 
if you don't know how to do it here's your opportunity.</p> 
<p>This year will feature the first ever Oktoberfest parade, small but maybe 
the first of another great Pagosa Springs tradition. Keep your eyes open for 
the float on U.S. 160 and cheer on the revelers as they pass by.</p> 
<p>The main event starts next at the community center - music, food, dancing, 
camaraderie and a full evening of fun for the whole family.</p> 
<p>Oktoberfest is the biggest fund-raiser of the year for Archuleta Seniors, 
Inc., a nonprofit organization at the Senior Foxes Den Senior Center. All 
proceeds benefit the senior citizens of Archuleta County, and Oktoberfest is a 
great way to show your support.</p> 
<p>This year adult and senior tickets include a full plate of German food and 
a 2004 commemorative Pilsner beer glass. The menu includes bratwurst, including 
vegetarian brats, German potato salad, and sauerkraut. Children's tickets 
include a hot dog, chips and dessert.</p> 
<p>The community center will again be the forum for this year's celebration, 
4:30-9:30 p.m. Tickets can be purchased at the Senior Center or Chamber of 
Commerce. Adult tickets are $13 in advance or $15 at the door; senior tickets 
are $10, and tickets for children aged 5-12 are $8.</p> 
<p>The popular Bier Garten (beer garden) will be back this year, and you can 
still purchase last year's commemorative beer stein for only $2.50. Iced tea 
and coffee are free, soda pop and bottled water are available for only $1 each.
</p> 
<p>Bring your friends and relatives for this fun-filled evening of family 
entertainment, and don't forget the Lederhosen.</p>

you could have met them almost anywhere in their various volunteer activities.
</p> 
<p>Bonnie recently remarked, &quot;Rather than go through life wearing two 
catcher's mitts, have one hand free to give something back.&quot;</p> 
<p>Regarding their participation, they remarked, &quot;We are honored to 
represent this United Way campaign and look forward to working with the 
community to meet this year's goal. We can all help in building a caring 
community by supporting the 15 local agencies that benefit from United Way 
funding.&quot;</p> 
<p>United Way is focused on organizing the ability of people to care for one 
another. Some of our partner agencies provide support in time of need, some 
help maintain a stable life, and others help prepare for a brighter future. The 
dollars raised here stay in Archuleta County to support the local community.</p>
<p>This year's theme is &quot;Make Your Caring Count,&quot; and the campaign 
goal for Archuleta County is $62,000.</p> 
<p>If you have already received a letter from Dick and Bonnie, please take a 
moment to reflect on how the represented agencies have or could support you, 
your families, your employees and your friends and contribute generously.</p> 
<p>There are so many newcomers in our growing community, many of you did not 
receive a personal letter inviting you to support this year's campaign. 
Newcomer, or old-timer, you are invited!</p> 
<p>Please &quot;Make Your Caring Count,&quot; in any amount you choose, with 
your tax deductible donation to United Way of Southwest Colorado, PO Box 4274, 
Pagosa Springs, CO 81147.</p> 
<p>If you are a business owner and want to find out how easy and effective a 
payroll deduction program is, just call Kathi DeClark - Archuleta County 
Coordinator at (970) 946-2057.</p> 
<p>Dick noted, after listening to presentations where each of the agencies 
described the programs for which they are requesting funding, &quot;It's truly 
heartwarming to learn about so many people and agencies in the area who are 
quietly working in the background to make this a better place to live. I see no 
easier way to keep all this good work going than to generously support the

<p>The fifth Bayfield Heritage Day and Sheep Trailing will take place Saturday.
</p> 
<p>It celebrates agricultural heritage of the Pine River Valley, the harvest, 
changing seasons and return of local sheep herds from mountain grazing.</p> 
<p>The day will start with a 5K run at 8:30 a.m., sponsored by Pine River 
Early Learning Center. Sign up at 8 a.m. in Joe Stephenson Park in old downtown 
Bayfield for $15.</p> 
<p>A parade will follow at 10 a.m. and be followed itself by the trailing of 
2,000 sheep through town on U.S. 160-B and Mill Street, then south on the Buck 
Highway (County Road 521). Spectators will be asked to stay on Mill street, 
away from the intersection, so the sheep will make that turn without getting 
scared and jamming up.</p> 
<p>Please, do not bring dogs to the event.</p> 
<p>Activities in Joe Stephenson park will include live music, arts and crafts, 
vendors and demonstrators featuring Four Corners area artisans, an old-time 
sheep camp, sheep shearing and sheep dog herding demonstrations, wagon rides, 
and lots of good food.</p>

<p><b>Local groups line up to help with Halloween party</b></p> 
<p><b>By Pauline Benetti</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Well, that didn't take long.</p> 
<p>One week and the community center has found more witches than it knows what 
to do with. With a couple more we will have a coven.</p> 
<p>Not surprising, though. Witching is such a glamorous occupation and there 
is such opportunity for creativity in the dress and makeup.</p> 
<p>Plans for the Halloween party continue to develop. Don't forget the date: 
Friday, Oct. 29, 5-7 p.m.</p> 
<p>The senior center has decided what it will do. Still a secret but they are 
out searching for various body parts. Should be good. We have heard from 
Heather Hunt of the School Within a School - some type of game will come out of 
their plans. Courtesy of the Sisson Library, we will have several personalities 
- a clown, a princess and a witch - all telling stories to the little ones.</p> 
<p>The Arts Council will be at its best with face creating appropriate to the 
evening.</p> 
<p>BootJack Ranch is sponsoring the inflatable bounce house, a favorite of 
many young goblins and Kiwanis Club has confirmed it will provide free hot dogs 
and punch good for 500.</p> 
<p>Opportunity remains for other businesses, organizations and individuals to 
get into the act by sponsoring an activity, booth, food or whatever. Just give 
a call to Mercy or Pauline at the community center, 264-4152. And for those who 
just want the opportunity to dress in costume, remember the contest categories 
are Most Elaborate, Most Gruesome and Most Original.</p> 
<p>On a different subject, the first meeting of the Friends of the Community 
Center will be held at noon Wednesday, Oct. 13, in the center. Lunch will be 
served as Jan Brookshier introduces the mission and objectives of the 
organization. Election of officers and establishment of committees will follow.
</p> 
<p>All current members are invited and encouraged to bring a friend who might 
become a Friend. Everyone interested in getting involved in our community is 
welcome to attend.</p> 
<p>And then there is a third subject - the community center multipurpose room 
is usually available during the mornings and the center intends to offer it 
free of charge to groups seeking a place to meet provided the use is open to 
the general public.</p> 
<p>Here is a place where several social events and gatherings could take place 
at the same time since the room is so large. A sampling of interests includes 
cards, board games, foreign language conversation, exercise, yoga, meditation, 
cooking, etc.</p> 
<p><b>Bulletin</b></p> 
<p>The senior center will offer free computer classes in the community center 
computer room Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m.-noon.</p> 
<p>The community center is open 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday. </p> 
<p>All witches, potential Friends and Halloween revelers call Mercy or Pauline 
at 264-4152.</p>

<p><b>Genealogy collection at library unsurpassed in Four Corners </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry </b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>One of the best unknown assets in Archuleta County is the exceptional 
collection of genealogical books and materials at the Sisson Library.</p> 
<p>There are about 350 books covering a wide range of genealogical subjects. 
It is said to be the best collection in the Four Corners.</p> 
<p>Included are 18 volumes of new England Historical and Genealogy Register; 
church records, including two volumes of Plymouth church records and Guide to 
Episcopal Records in Virginia; 20 volumes of Native American records; land 
records; information about the Orphan Train; ship lists; South Carolina 
Immigrants 1768-1770; Winthrop Fleet 1630; family genealogies and books on all 
wars; general information about genealogy; a slew of books on individual states 
and many books on Colorado.</p> 
<p>These are just some of the books to show the wide variety in the 
collection. At present, they are stored until the library addition is finished. 
Volunteers packed 36 boxes of books to store.</p> 
<p>The books have been donated to the library by members of the Archuleta 
County Genealogical Society and the society itself.</p> 
<p>The society meets the second Sunday of the month in the Sisson Library. The 
meeting this month, Oct. 10, will be held at 1 p.m., a change of time from the 
regular 2:30. Lenore Bright will talk about the new addition and the placing of 
the collection in it.</p> 
<p>Although going online for information is available, original sources of 
information are usually not cited so as to establish validity of the 
information. Therefore, the value of the books and materials found in libraries 
is vital.</p> 
<p>And, too, there is something about holding a book in your hands. It's like 
visiting with a friend.</p>

dance yourselves silly and stay in town.</p> 
<p>Our Dance Club meeting brought no interested dancers Oct. 28. We will try

pinochle players meet at 1 as well. In preparation for either event, you may

given a number of presentations here and is always well attended. Find out what 
your dreams are telling you.</p> 
<p>The Seeds of Learning kids will be here to sing Oct. 12, after we have our

come in before lunch and we'll set up a time for you to perform.</p> 
<p>The White Cane Society will meet here 11 a.m. Oct. 13. This group supports 
people with vision challenges, so come in for information and help if you or 
someone you know has vision problems.</p> 
<p>A lot of people have been calling about flu shots and we will have San Juan

<p>AARP ElderWatch and the attorney general warn seniors of federal government 
grant scheme:</p> 
<p>In the past two weeks, AARP ElderWatch has received calls from seniors who 
have been offered grants through the &quot;federal grant information 
center.&quot; In all cases the caller begins by explaining that as a taxpayer 
the senior has randomly been selected for a federal grant of several thousand 
dollars, but before any money can be exchanged the senior must pay an 
application fee, usually between $250 and $500.</p> 
<p>The caller then insists that the senior provide a bank account and routing 
number in order for the grant to be direct deposited.</p> 
<p>Seniors should be advised that there is no federal grant information center 
and that no consumer should ever pay a fee before being awarded a grant or 
prize.</p> 
<p>Once a perpetrator has an account number they can empty a bank account with 
one withdrawal. One bank reported that a client lost over $8,000. Citizens 
approached by these con artists are encouraged to report the incident to AARP 
ElderWatch a program with the Colorado attorney general and the AARP Foundation.
</p> 
<p>The objective is to stop the financial exploitation of seniors. Seniors and 
their families can call the AARP ElderWatch consumer hotline and speak with a 
counselor to discuss consumer issues and request additional information. The 
hotline is staffed 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday-Friday at 1-800-222-4444; press option 
2 for AARP ElderWatch.</p>

<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Congratulations and our thanks to the entire Pagosa Springs Music Boosters 
organization for a most successful weekend of hosting the Southwest Colorado 
Community Theatre Festival.</p> 
<p>This is the first time our group has hosted this event, and I'm sure all 
the attending communities were impressed and downright overwhelmed with the 
professional way in which everything was handled.</p> 
<p>I attended all the performances except Sunday morning and assisted Michael 
DeWinter with his &quot;Art of Creative Costuming&quot; workshop and thoroughly 
enjoyed myself. </p> 
<p>Edgar Lansbury, the keynote speaker Saturday, was interesting and 
informative and the Boosters' production of &quot;The Hills Are Alive . . 
.&quot; was a total knockout. The audience couldn't have been more pleased and 
appreciative of the talented performances they witnessed on the stage that 
night. </p> 
<p>We are indeed lucky to have such a wonderful organization in Pagosa Springs 
and are most grateful to each and every member who worked so hard last weekend 
to make it such a great success.</p> 
<p><b>Halloween party</b></p> 
<p>It will be here before you know it, so do plan to join the big Halloween 
party at the community center 5-7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 29.</p> 
<p>There will be many festivities including a costume contest as well as the 
food, games and activities with prizes galore. I consider this such a great 
alternative for families who are faced with taking their children door to door 
in sometimes cold, inclement weather to do the &quot;trick or treat&quot; 
thing. It can be a quite onerous task in a dark, rainy night, so the Halloween 
party presents a welcome and safe choice and one which the little ones have 
many activities to enjoy.</p> 
<p>Pauline and Mercy at the community center are looking for organizations and 
businesses interested in sponsoring a food booth or any of the activities 
and/or games held that night.</p> 
<p>Plan to bring the whole family to the Halloween party on the 29th, and 
please give some thought to sponsoring an activity that night.</p> 
<p>Give Mercy or Pauline a call at 264-5232 to offer your services.</p> 
<p><b>'The Nutcracker'</b> </p> 
<p>Remember that Saturday, Nov. 13, is the annual Immaculate Heart of Mary 
fashion show and luncheon beginning at noon in the Parish Hall.</p> 
<p>This year's theme is &quot;The Nutcracker,&quot; featuring music provided 
by John Graves with dancing honors performed by local ballerinas.</p> 
<p>Our Pagosa merchants will supply the very latest fashions, and Dahrl Henley 
can always be counted upon to serve only the finest and tastiest food around. 
It's always a beautifully executed event and tons of fun.</p> 
<p>Tickets are still only $18 and can be purchased at the Chamber of Commerce. 
I will tell you that a number of tickets have already been sold for this event, 
so don't tarry. I promise you this event will sell out very quickly as it has 
done every year, and you will be exceedingly sad to miss such a lovely affair.
</p> 
<p>Should you want to put together a table of 10, you must first purchase the 
tickets then call Mary Daltroff at 731-5121 to reserve the table in your name.
</p> 
<p>The door prizes donated by our local merchants at this luncheon are always 
outstanding and feel free to call Yvonne Ralston at 731-9324 or June Geisen at 
731-5429 if you would like to donate an item or two.</p>

<p><b>Baile de Otono</b></p>

the popular band, Latin Express.</p> 
<p>Cost for this fun-filled evening is $10 per person, and all proceeds will

<p><b>Oktoberfest</b></p> 
<p>It's time for the annual oompah-pah wing-ding of the year, the Oktoberfest 
party sponsored by the Archuleta Seniors, Inc. 4:30-9:30 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 
16, in Pagosa Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>I heard over the weekend that attendance at the Oktoberfest celebration 
held in Germany recently was down 40,000 people due to the cold, rainy weather 
conditions. Clearly, you don't have to give the weather a thought to attend the 
Pagosa version because you will be cozy and warm in the community center with 
plenty of sustenance and indoor plumbing.</p> 
<p>The price of admission includes a commemorative glass beer stein and 
traditional German cuisine including grilled bratwursts, sauerkraut, hot German 
potato salad and, of course, German beer. As if that weren't enough, cookies, 
brownies and hot coffee will top off the evening for you.</p> 
<p>If you have attended this event, you know we will be entertained by local 
musicians who specialize in authentic, lively German music and everyone is 
invited to join in the group dances, the chicken dance and just about anything 
else they happen to dream up.</p> 
<p>It's a family affair offering everyone the opportunity to socialize, dance 
and eat in the great tradition of an authentic German Oktoberfest. Please pass 
along to any friends or family who might want to come to Pagosa for this event 
that The Spa at Pagosa Springs is offering a 10-percent discount to Oktoberfest 
attendees who would like to stay close to the event. Call 264-5910 to make your 
reservation for that night.</p> 
<p>Oktoberfest tickets are now available at the Chamber of Commerce and the 
community center for $13 presale for adults ($15 at the door), $10 for seniors 
and $8 for children. </p> 
<p><b>Visitor center stats</b> </p> 
<p>July was clearly the banner month so far this year at the Chamber with over 
9,000 visitors coming through our doors, and August wasn't so shabby with 
almost 7,000.</p> 
<p>Historically, there is a rather precipitous drop in September, and this 
year was no exception with a still-decent showing of 4,500.</p> 
<p>The breakdown of the top five states is as predictable as the sun coming up 
in the morning with Texas at 6,000, Colorado with 4,100, New Mexico at 2,900 
and Oklahoma and Arizona virtually neck-and-neck at 1,847 and 1,834 
respectively. Obviously, other than in Utah, we are quite popular with 
contiguous states as well as our very own. And, 163 Canadians traveled quite a 
way to visit, and the collective German, England and &quot;other&quot; category 
combined for a respectable total of 765.</p> 
<p>This many folks coming to Pagosa Springs already this year is yet another 
reminder that we have definitely been discovered. California was the only other 
state with over 1,000 and, of interest, the states of &quot;around 500 and 
under 1,000&quot; are Kansas, Montana, Florida and Illinois. For the 
edification of those who love the numbers game, North Dakota enjoys the dubious 
distinction of the lowest number to date, 11.</p> 
<p>To date, we have sent a total of 3,137 summer/winter/relocation information 
packets to folks requesting them over the phone, in person or on line. Texas, 
of course, comes in with the highest number at 670, Colorado with 518, and 
California, Arizona and New Mexico coming in at the nicely graduated numbers of 
192, 182 and 172 respectively.</p> 
<p>Since over 1,000 Californians signed in at the Visitor Center, the great 
majority must visit us online and make their plans as opposed to requesting an 
informational packet, although we know from experience that some do both. 
Oklahoma and, here's a surprise, Missouri were the only other two states that 
requested over 100.</p> 
<p>We have sent a total of 1,991 summer packets, 636 winter packets and 510 
relocation packets to date. We have received 1,907 e-mail requests, 1,094 
phone, friend or in-person requests and around 150 through Woodall's and AAA 
ads and referrals.</p> 
<p>We have also had an amazing response of almost 50 calls on an ad we placed 
in a magazine called &quot;True West.&quot; One never knows in the 
advertising/marketing game when something is going to strike an unexpected 
chord, and clearly this one did.</p> 
<p><b>Membership</b></p> 
<p>Speaking of respectable numbers, we have three new members to introduce to 
you this week and three renewals. Whoever said that the shoulder season wasn't 
any fun?</p> 
<p>Our old friend, Denny Barber, has done it again with a restaurant, and, in 
tandem with the wildly popular Hogs Breath Restaurant, he now brings us 
Dionigi's Italian Caf&eacute; located just east of Hogs Breath and his other 
business, Silverado Clothing, at 117 Navajo Trail Drive. I haven't confirmed 
this with Denny, but I understand that Dionigi is Italian for Denny, but I'll 
have to check on that and get back to you. What I know for sure is that 
Dionigi's serves a wide selection of classic Italian recipes with a touch of 
their Louisiana heritage. They have a variety of pizza selections on the menu 
which you can eat right there or place an order to go. They also offer a 
children's menu as well as great prices. If you would like to order a pizza or 
have any questions about Dionigi's, please call 731-4258.</p>

<p><b>Military records essential</b></p> 
<p><b>for VA claims and benefits </b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Military records are an essential part of applying for and obtaining VA 
benefits and claims.</p> 
<p>The various categories of military service records are described in the 
chart below. For each category there is a code number.</p> 
<p>1. Health and personnel records. In most cases involving individuals no 
longer on active duty, the personnel record, the health record, or both can be 
obtained from the same location, as shown on the chart.</p> 
<p>However, some health records are available from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) Records Management Center (Code 11). A request for a copy of the 
health record should be sent to Code 11 if the person was discharged, retired, 
or released from active duty (separated) on or after the following dates: Army 
- Oct. 16, 1992; Navy - Jan.31, 1994; Air Force and Marine Corps - May 1, 1994; 
Coast Guard -April 1, 1998.</p> 
<p>Health records of persons on active duty are generally kept at the local 
servicing clinic, and usually are available from Code 11 a week or two after 
the last day of active duty.</p> 
<p>2. Records at the National Personnel Records Center. Note that it takes at 
least three months, and often six or seven, for the file to reach the National 
Personnel Records Center (Code 14) in St. Louis after the military obligation 
has ended (such as by discharge). If only a short time has passed, please send 
the inquiry to the address shown for active or current reserve members. Also, 
if the person has only been released from active duty but is still in a reserve 
status, the personnel record will stay at the location specified for 
reservists. A person can retain a reserve obligation for several years, even 
without attending meetings or receiving annual training.</p> 
<p>3. Definitions and abbreviations. Discharged -the individual has no current 
military status; Health - records of physical examinations, dental treatment, 
and outpatient medical treatment received while in a duty status (does not 
include records of treatment while hospitalized); TDRL - Temporary Disability 
Retired List.</p> 
<p><b>Durango VA clinic</b> </p> 
<p>The Durango VA Outpatient Clinic is at 400 S. Camino Del Rio, Suite G, 
Durango, CO 81301. Phone number is 247-2214.</p> 
<p><b>Further information</b> </p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans' benefits please call or stop 
by the Archuleta County Veteran's Service Office on the lower floor of the 
county courthouse. The office number is 264-8375, fax 264-8376, e-mail 
afautheree@archuletacounty.org. The office is open from 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday, Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 (discharge) for 
registration with the county, application for VA programs, and for filing in 
the VSO office.</p>

<p><b>League's brochure spells out election issues </b></p> 
<p><b>By Lenore Bright</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Maureen Covell brought us the League of Women Voters pamphlet discussing 
the many proposals on the November ballot.</p> 
<p>You may pick up a free copy thanks to the League. </p> 
<p>This election has four proposed changes to the state constitution. We 
learned our lesson with TABOR. It is exceedingly difficult to change or undo 
constitutional amendments. Be very careful and be sure you understand the 
wording. These LVW pamphlets really help clarify what will happen if the 
amendments pass. Thanks to the League for these nonpartisan educational pieces.

<p><b>Building plans</b></p> 
<p>Revised building drawings are in the hands of the town building inspector. 
We should have word very soon as to when and if we can begin construction. Keep

<p><b>New books</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place,&quot; by Aron Ralston, is the 
survival story of the young Colorado man who cut off his own arm to avoid 
certain death. Reviewers say this is a brilliantly written, funny, honest, 
inspiring and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets 
life. The book will take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Native Peoples of the Southwest,&quot; by Trudy Griffin-Pierce, is a 
comprehensive look at the Native American cultures in our area. It is one of 
the first books to provide viewpoints of the Native Americans themselves as 
well as ethno geographic research. Each group is discussed and profiled. </p> 
<p>Subjects include linguistic affiliation, social organization, history, 
world view, material culture and ceremonial institutions. Contemporary issues 
include the repatriation of sacred objects, preservation of native plants and 
reservation gambling.</p> 
<p>Griffin-Pierce teaches anthropology at the University of Arizona. As a 
young Anglo girl from a military family living in Florida, she had the desire 
to live among the Navajo. When her mother died during Trudy's high school 
years, she wrote to the Tribal Chairman Raymond Nakai and asked him the find 
her a traditional family she could join. Her Navajo experience led her to a 
career in writing and teaching.</p> 
<p>Indians covered in this book include Pueblos, Hopi, Zuni, Pimans, Yaqui, 
River Yumans, the Upland Yumans, Apache, Navajo, O'odham and Southern Paiute. 
The author presents the great cultural vitality and living dynamic nature of 
these groups including their contemporary situations. This book conveys the 
sense of the region as a whole.</p> 
<p><b>Holiday closing</b></p> 
<p>The library will be closed Monday for Columbus Day.</p> 
<p><b>Donations</b></p> 
<p>We thank Cynthia Sharp and Ralph and Sam Goulds for donations to the

<p><b>Arts council president receives state 'Arts Are the Heart' award </b></p>
<p><b>By Leanne Goebel</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Barbara Neal served on the staff of the Colorado Council on the Arts for 26 
years. To celebrate and commemorate her compassionate work, the Colorado Arts 
Consortium created &quot;The Arts Are the Heart&quot; award.</p> 
<p>This award honors individuals working in the arts and in arts management 
who make a significant contribution to their local communities, and exemplify 
the leadership qualities that made Neal's influence special: The ability to 
bring people together, a straightforward and articulate manner, honesty, and 
caring. The enrichment of community was Neal's main concern; she received the 
first &quot;Arts Are the Heart&quot; award in 1994.</p> 
<p>This year, the Colorado Arts Consortium honored Doris Green, president of 
Pagosa Springs Arts Council with &quot;The Arts Are the Heart&quot; award.</p> 
<p>Green has made a significant contribution to the local community of Pagosa 
Springs. She has Southern charm and business savvy and the ability to bring 
people together. She is the first to role her sleeves up and dive into a 
project and the last to leave. She is relentless. She is passionate. She knows 
how to throw a party.</p> 
<p><b>Healing arts highlights</b></p> 
<p>Panelists Sheri R. Rochford, special assistant to the president of Fort 
Lewis College Foundation, and Brian Wagner, executive director of the Durango 
Arts Center discussed their experiences with capital campaigns. Rochford helped 
raise the money to build the Community Concert Hall at Fort Lewis College, the 
new art building, and the Center for Southwest Studies, when consultants told 
the college it couldn't be done. Wagner was involved in acquiring the building 
that now houses the Durango Arts Center.</p> 
<p>Rochford highlighted the 10 things an organization should analyze when 
determining if it can have a successful capital campaign. In doing so, she 
utilized information she borrowed from a book by Kent E. Dove, &quot;Conducting 
A Successful Capital Campaign.&quot;</p> 
<p>Commitment of time and support from key participants. The committee 
involved in building the Community Concert Hall met at 6:30 a.m. every Tuesday. 
No one ever missed a meeting.</p> 
<p>A clear organization self-image and strategic plan. Who are you and where 
are you going? Fund-raising objectives based on legitimate institutional plans, 
goals, budgets, and needs. The need for the new art building came about when 
snow collapsed the roof of the old building.</p> 
<p>A written document that makes a compelling case for supporting the 
campaign. Can you put into writing the features and benefits of supporting the 
campaign?</p> 
<p>An assessment of the institutional development program and market survey 
addressing internal and external preparedness. Has an outside professional 
evaluated the program and have you surveyed staff and community?</p> 
<p>Enlistment and education of volunteer leaders. It is imperative that 
volunteer leaders be trained and that the organization has a well developed 
list of volunteers.</p> 
<p>Ability and readiness of major donors to give substantial lead gifts before 
any public announcement of campaign. Here is where relationships become 
critically important. There are key donors in a community and they must be 
involved from the beginning.</p> 
<p>A competent staff and perhaps external professional counsel. Know to whom 
you will go if you need assistance or advice.</p> 
<p>Adequate funds to cover fund-raising expenses. You have to spend money to 
raise money.</p> 
<p>Other factors to consider:</p> 
<p>- Older organizations tend to be better established than younger ones. 
Partner with the more established organizations if possible. Organizations tend 
to do better raising money when their constituencies are older, wealthier, 
better educated and more skilled.</p> 
<p>Who is your audience? Can they afford to help your organization? </p> 
<p>- A fully developed giving program. Before your organization mounts a 
capital campaign it is important to already have in place an annual giving 
program or membership drive; a planned giving program, for those who want to 
leave money to your organization in a will or trust; a major gifts program such 
as endowment; and a prospect research program where you have identified 
potential prospects.</p> 
<p>- The size and geographical distribution of your constituency. This is more 
challenging in a rural area. We don't have the population numbers to draw from. 
Previous fund-raising success is critically important. If you haven't been able 
to raise significant funds from volunteers and donors, how can you expect to 
raise hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars?</p> 
<p>- Quality of the program and the impact it has on the community. People 
have to believe in what you are doing and feel that it somehow benefits them. 
Location of your organization. Are you in an enterprise zone? Historical 
district? These can be invaluable in helping raise money.</p> 
<p>- Human factors. Do you have enough volunteers? Are they qualified? Are 
they committed? Are they passionate?</p> 
<p>- State of economy? In a strong economy more money is available for 
enterprise zones and historical district funding. In a weaker economy, such as 
ours, those funds are depleted and there is more competition for those dollars.
</p> 
<p>- Competing and conflicting campaigns. Who else is raising money? Right 
now, the Humane Society is involved in a major capital campaign to build their 
new facility. While an arts organization may not consider that direct 
competition, the fact that our community is small and the donor bases for all 
nonprofit organizations overlap, means this is not a good time to try and 
launch a huge campaign for something else.</p> 
<p>- Trends in the local nonprofit sector. Are we spinning off dozens of arts 
organizations into their own 501(c) 3 organizations and are we all competing 
for the same dollars? Does this make sense? Can all these organizations unite 
to build a cultural center? Unfavorable publicity about the project can halt 
progress before you even get started. What other local issues must be 
considered?</p> 
<p>- At the end of the process challenge gifts and matching gifts from private 
foundations such as the Boettcher Foundation can help your organization reach 
it's goal.</p> 
<p>Remember, an organization will get most of its money from a cluster of top 
donors. Identify these people early and build relationships with them. Don't 
spend your time on special events unless you have a recognition problem. They 
take huge amounts of time and effort.</p> 
<p>- The success of a capital campaign is dependent upon strong organizational 
leadership and the commitment of the board of directors.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Food for Thought</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Become a shepherd and live longer </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>I'm at the recreation center, doing one of the most inane and unsightly 
things imaginable: I'm riding a stationary exercise bike, pedaling for all I'm 
worth.</p> 
<p>Think about it: The bike goes nowhere. Sure, I can imagine I am peddling to 
Bayfield and back; I can see the fictional mileage displayed on the control 
panel. The bike will even produce the illusion I am traveling at a certain 
rate. Oh, look, I've biked seven miles and I am whipping along at a brisk 12 
miles per hour.</p> 
<p>Ours is a sad species, is it not?</p> 
<p>But, I remind myself, stripped of motivational illusions the activity has a 
purpose: better health. With every fantasy mile, I tell myself I am a better 
physical being, a healthier guy.</p> 
<p>A healthier, older guy.</p> 
<p>In truth, my activity is fueled at a deep level by the reality of age and 
is part of a poignant, losing battle to forestall the inevitable.</p> 
<p>I am helped along this particular day by a magazine article I read as I 
pedal. After all, the blunt idiocy of the activity is unavoidable if you flail 
away on one of these machines with no significant outside input - something to 
read, a television to watch. Without the distraction, time (oh, that cruel, 
elastic thing) stretches, the clock on the bike's control panel seems to slow 
to a crawl, one inevitably begins to wonder if there aren't better things to 
do. Many things.</p> 
<p>I am reading a begrimed copy of one of those snappy guys-only publications, 
learning new things about what it is to be a man. I've ripped through a couple 
articles concerning the &quot;perfect&quot; outdoor vacations, pausing only 
long enough on a piece about kayaking in Vermont to fortify my resolution to 
remain indoors whenever possible. My idea of a sporting vacation involves a 
short walk between blackjack tables at a Vegas casino or a brief hike to a 
favorite restaurant - preferably one in the same hotel where I am staying. I 
would be up for a stroll in Amsterdam or Paris, but not without frequent stops 
for intoxicants.</p> 
<p>I breeze through an article touting the best SUVs on the market (I am 
cautioned to never be misled by &quot;air conditioning, stereos, or a soft 
ride&quot;) and a profile of a ruggedly handsome country western music star 
I've never heard of and whose music will never grace my playlist. There's a 
comparison of several brands of trail mix but, since I don't include Styrofoam 
and tree bark in my diet, I am not interested. I turn the page.</p> 
<p>What I then confront is an article purporting to reveal &quot;how to live 
longer.&quot; I am promised &quot;New longevity secrets to keep you young and 
healthy.&quot;</p> 
<p>As I've noted, the fact I am on a stationary bike that provides me with 
Platonic mileage and speed readouts indicates I am capable of profound 
delusion. Why not add staying young and healthy to the list?</p> 
<p>I dive into the article and I want to share some things with those of you 
who have passed both the &quot;I'm bulletproof and immortal&quot; stage of 
adolescence and early adulthood, and the &quot;I don't need to worry about it 
yet&quot; phase of early middle age. I need to share what I gleaned from the 
article with those of you who have moved on to &quot;Oh no, this doesn't look 
good; I better devote more time to Scripture.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to this article, if you want to prolong your life, you need to 
live in Sardinia. Moreover, it helps if you are a shepherd.</p> 
<p>Apparently, such folks have low cholesterol, thin-walled and supple 
arteries, a stunningly low incidence of diabetes, the kidneys of a teenager and 
a resting heart rate in the low 60s.</p> 
<p>How do they do it? And what can we do to mimic their somatic success?</p> 
<p>There is heartening news.</p> 
<p>One detailed survey reveals that an optimistic attitude has nothing to do 
with longevity. In fact, say the scientists who studied these Sardinian 
shepherds, being grumpy might be an advantage. I like this. I've always 
believed an abundance of false joy and a fake smile get you nowhere and act, 
instead, as signals of enormous insecurity, It's encouraging to see a blow 
struck for low expectations, to know that being pessimistic can prolong your 
life.</p> 
<p>A second clue: Fire up the grill and toast some flesh. There's nothing 
wrong with meat. While you're at it, enjoy a hunk of dry sausage. Have some 
cheese. But also load up on fresh vegetables.</p> 
<p>Things get better. Drink wine, reds in particular, ideally grown at an 
altitude of more than 2,000 feet.</p> 
<p>Some other tips: marry well (a bad marriage can kill you and/or your 
spouse); be conscientious and dependable (memorize and repeat the Boy Scout 
Oath); drink coffee; get rich (how a shepherd manages this is beyond me); be 
religious (see above, re. Scripture); make friends (with friends like mine, I 
have questions about this); take some aspirin; enjoy frequent sexual relations 
(the author is unclear as to whether or not this requires another person).</p> 
<p>Don't exercise too much, says the author. After I read this, I get off the 
exercise bike. I don't need much of an excuse.</p> 
<p>Cut back on the amount you eat by 10 to 20 percent. Makes sense. 
Unfortunately.</p> 
<p>Finally, make liberal use of olive oil.</p> 
<p>I am definitely in the groove with this one - not just for health reasons 
but because I value the rich, wonderful taste imparted by a good quality oil. 
Toss out all but some top-grade vegetable oil for higher-temperature work and 
cruise with the nectar of the olive, You can't go wrong.</p> 
<p>I keep two grades of olive oil handy in the kitchen. The first is a 
cheaper, lighter oil often labeled &quot;pure&quot; and the result of a second 
pressing. This oil is best suited to stove work.</p> 
<p>The better oil is labeled &quot;extra-virgin,&quot; comes from a first, 
cold pressing and contains less acid than the lesser product. It's easy to spot 
the top-shelf oils at the market: they are often darker, frequently green in 
tint, and they cost a lot more than the lower quality oil. Bite the budget 
bullet and buy a bottle. Open the bottle, take a swig. If you're timid, dip a 
small piece of bread in the oil and eat it. Fruity, isn't it? A food in itself. 
It's the wine of oils.</p> 
<p>When I saut&eacute; meats and/or vegetables, there are many times I will 
ignore expense and use the highest grade olive oil to take advantage of the 
greater flavor. The oil provides a strong foundation for dishes, a depth that 
lighter, ordinary cooking oils cannot give you.</p> 
<p>As an example: There is a galaxy of variations available when you play off 
a pan-roasted chicken breast in which the seasoned meat is caramelized in a 
sheen of olive oil in a heavy pan on the stovetop then finished in a hot oven 
for 12 to 15 minutes.</p> 
<p>Once roasted, the meat is removed to a heated plate while a bit more of the 
high-grade oil is added to the pan with aromatics and herbs and spices of one 
kind or another (to which compass point on the taste map do you want to travel 
- tarragon, oregano, basil, cumin, caraway, chiles? Onion, garlic, celery, 
tomato?).</p> 
<p>The pan is deglazed with a liquid paired with the choice of aromatics - 
wines and/or stocks. The goodies produced by the roasting process are scraped 
up into the liquid and the amalgam is reduced to a near syrupy consistency. 
Back in goes the chicken and - instead of butter - more of the extra virgin 
olive oil is added and it emulsifies over heat as the seasonings are adjusted.
</p> 
<p>Oily, olivey good.</p> 
<p>And for dressings, break out the extra-virgin oil. Sure, there are other 
flavorful oils that can and should be used in some dressings, but it is hard to 
beat a vinaigrette with a top-of-the-line extra virgin olive oil as the base.
</p> 
<p>Heck, to top off the oil level you can imitate those restaurants that 
puddle some super balsamic vinegar in a pool of extra virgin, salt it a bit and 
dip into it with bits of bread.</p> 
<p>You guzzle the oil, you live longer.</p> 
<p>Me, I intend to follow the guidelines in the article as closely as I can.
</p> 
<p>I will use more olive oil.</p> 
<p>I'll double my cheese consumption and chase each wedge with some 
high-altitude wine.</p> 
<p>I won't ride that ridiculous stationary bike again.</p> 
<p>I can't afford a ticket to Sardinia at the moment but I'll put 5 percent of 
each paycheck into a special account and, when there is enough cash accrued to 
book passage, I'll call a travel agent. I'll hook up with a Sardinian real 
estate broker via the Web and start looking for some land, preferably with 
verdant rolling hills.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, anyone have some sheep for sale?</p>

<p> </p> <b>Cruising with Cruse</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Climbing Pagosa Peak is dreadful &#151; but doable</b></p> 
<p><b>By Katherine Cruse</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>I've done it. I've hiked to the top of Pagosa Peak.</p> 
<p>I never aspired to bag Pagosa Peak. Besides, I've gotten higher than Pagosa 
Peak (elevation 12,600) just by hiking the Continental Divide Trail from Wolf 
Creek to Silverton. Carrying 45 pounds on my back and spending nights in a 
tent, fer gosh sakes.</p> 
<p>But people kept asking if I had 'done Pagosa.' The way they said it, I know 
they assumed the answer was yes. As in, &quot;You've climbed Pagosa Peak, 
right?&quot; and then, &quot;No? You haven't? I don't believe it.&quot; Believe 
it, already.</p> 
<p>I got tired of explaining that I hadn't or saying that it was my goal to be 
the last person in the county to climb it. Besides, you can't be the last 
person when new people are arriving every day.</p> 
<p>Earlier this summer I hiked to the top of Blackhead Peak, the second 
highest mountain around here. That trip leader said Blackhead was harder than 
Pagosa. Well, maybe. They're different climbs, and each one is difficult, 
although in different ways.</p> 
<p>I survived the Blackhead climb, so I figured this was the summer to do 
Pagosa. Get it over with.</p> 
<p>My dear friend Flash, who's been there a couple of times, agreed to take me 
and our friend Doc, another slow hiker, and a couple of other noncompetitive 
hikers up, all of us for the first time.</p> 
<p>There are several routes to the top of Pagosa Peak. You can use the 
Anderson Trail to get to the vicinity. Apparently, you leave the Anderson Trail 
and bushwhack to a small saddle on the south side of Pagosa Peak. Then you turn 
right and start up. And up.</p> 
<p>The route we took was to drive in on Black Mountain Road off of Plumtaw 
Road for about half an hour. Black Mountain is a rutted, barely maintained road.
</p> 
<p>The Forest Service closes it in the winter, with good reason. A four-wheel 
drive vehicle isn't mandatory, but you'd be a fool to attempt it with anything 
else.</p> 
<p>You need a guide, someone who's been there before, just to find the 
trailhead. After that, staying on the trail is pretty easy, because so many 
people are using it. This is an unofficial trail. It was not laid out by the 
Forest Service. It was not laid out by anyone who cares about erosion, bad 
knees, or people from lower elevations. It basically goes uphill. Until you 
reach that saddle that lets you look down on the Anderson Trail. And then it 
gets steep.</p> 
<p>Climbing Pagosa Peak is dreadful, but it is doable. Two miles, more or 
less, and 2,400 feet up, also more or less. It took us four hours, about twice 
as long as some people take. I'm sure that I was the slowest one.</p> 
<p>A friend of mine climbed the peak one summer right after she had walked in 
the 60-mile Susan Komen Foundation march to raise money for breast cancer 
research. She thought she was in pretty good shape, but she was not prepared 
for Pagosa. She told me, &quot;Air. I couldn't get enough air.&quot;</p> 
<p>The top of the mountain that we see from down here is not the top of the 
mountain. It's a false peak, and it's maybe 20 feet lower than the real peak. 
There's a narrow ridge about 200 feet long between the two peaks. For some it's 
pretty scary, because the mountain drops off so sharply on either side. It's 
not recommended for people with vertigo.</p> 
<p>I told Flash that I wasn't sure I'd go beyond the false peak. &quot;But 
then you won't get to sign the register,&quot; he said. &quot;Can't you bring 
it to me?&quot; I asked. He shook his head.</p> 
<p>It turned out that for me the crossing from the false peak to the real one 
was easy, probably because it wasn't steep. I could breathe.</p> 
<p>The top of Pagosa Peak is a rounded bump. There's a small pile of rocks to 
indicate the highest point, and tucked in among the rocks is the register, a 
plastic bottle with lots of scraps of paper, and a pencil.</p> 
<p>Doc stood on top of the cairn and danced. We took turns taking pictures 
with each other's cameras. We all signed the register. We admired the view.</p> 
<p>Because Pagosa Peak stands pretty much alone, you're higher than anything 
else around. You feel like you're on top of the world, and in a sense you are.
</p> 
<p>After the requisite amount of oohing and aahing, we sat down in the lee of 
the peak to eat our lunch. A movement caught our eye, and we turned to see 
three people hiking up the northwest side of the peak. They had parked on the 
road near our vehicles and climbed the peak from a different route, 
bushwhacking all the way. They said they preferred that to the more popular 
so-called trail with its steep eroded sections made slippery by little rocks 
that act like ball bearings. Some people call them death marbles.</p> 
<p>We descended the peak in just over two hours. I ended up with sore muscles 
and aching knees. I cut my leg, swinging it too carelessly over a downed tree 
across the trail. The trail down is a toe jammer, and I beat up one toenail so 
badly that I eventually lost it.</p> 
<p>The day after the Pagosa Peak climb, I hiked to Quartz Ridge and beyond 
with another friend. &quot;Bad timing,&quot; people told me, &quot;doing those 
two back to back.&quot; But we'd made the date for this hike months before. The 
climb to Quartz Ridge, although strenuous, was a piece of cake in comparison 
with the one the day before.</p> 
<p>As for Pagosa Peak, I can now say, &quot;Oh sure, I've climbed it.&quot; I 
might even say, 'The last time I climbed Pagosa Peak.'&quot;</p> 
<p>And I don't ever have to do it again.</p>

<p><b>Beware of the 809 phone scam </b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>We actually received a call last week from an &quot;809&quot; area code. 
The woman said, &quot;Hey, this is Karen. Sorry I missed you - get back to us 
quickly. Have something important to tell you.&quot;</p> 
<p>Then she repeated a phone number beginning with 809.</p> 
<p>Beware! Don't ever dial area code 809, 284 or 876. Here is some very 
relevant information provided by AT&amp;T:</p> 
<p>Don't respond to e-mails, phone calls, or Web pages which tell you to call 
an 809 area phone number.</p> 
<p>This is a very important issue of Scam Busters because it alerts you to a 
scam that is spreading quickly, can easily cost you $2,400 or more, and is 
difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it. This scam has been identified by 
the National Fraud Information Center and is costing victims a lot of money.</p>
<p>There are lots of different permutations of this scam. Here's how it works:
</p> 
<p>You will receive a message on your answering machine or your pager, which 
asks you to call a number beginning with an area code 809. The reason you've 
been asked to call varies. It can be to receive information about a family 
member who has been ill, to tell you someone has been arrested, died, to let 
you know you have won a wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you are told to 
call the 809 number right away. Since there are so many new area codes these 
days, people unknowingly return these calls.</p> 
<p>You will be charged a huge amount per minute. You will get a long recorded 
message. The point is, they will try to keep you on the phone as long as 
possible to increase the charges.</p> 
<p>Why does it work?</p> 
<p>The 809 area code is located in the British Virgin Islands (the Bahamas).
</p> 
<p>The 809 area code can be used as a &quot;pay-per-call&quot; number, similar 
to 900 numbers in the U.S. Since 809 is not in the U.S. it is not covered by 
U.S. regulations of 900 numbers, which require that you be notified and warned 
of charges and rates involved when you call a &quot;pay-per-call&quot; number.
</p> 
<p>AT&amp;T recommended that no matter how you get the message, if you are 
asked to call a number with an 809 area code that you disregard the message.</p>
<p>It's important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam since trying to 
fight the charges afterward can become a nightmare.</p> 
<p>That's because you did, actually, make the call. If you complain, both your 
local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get 
involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the 
billing for the foreign company.</p> 
<p>You'll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues it has done 
nothing wrong.</p>

<p><b>Faye Mattie Teeson Brown</b></p> 
<p>In the early morning hours of Sept. 28, 2004, Faye Mattie Teeson Brown left 
this world peacefully, ready for her next adventure.</p> 
<p>Faye was born on March 9, 1905 in Chromo, Colo., and lived most of her life 
in Archuleta County. She married Raymond Theodore Brown on Oct. 29, 1922, in 
Pagosa Springs. She was proud to be a rancher, a lifestyle she felt was her 
destiny. There was nothing that Faye couldn't ride, tame or love.</p> 
<p>Her deep faith in her Heavenly Father was at the core of Faye's life. That 
faith manifested itself in the love that spilled forth onto everyone she met. 
There were no strangers to Faye. She did not understand prejudice and had 
friends of all races, religions and social or economic status. Faye put the 
needs and concerns of others before her own; she had a way of making each 
person feel like the most important person in the world.</p> 
<p>And Faye fed everybody. Whether you came to visit or were a hired hand, 
Faye would feed you and usually send you away with food to take home. The milk, 
butter and cream from Faye's cows helped to raise half the population of Pagosa 
Springs.</p> 
<p>Faye lived through tremendous hardships and poverty and did whatever had to 
be done to make ends meet. She always had her cattle, her horses, vegetable 
garden and crop of hay. Her love for her animals was legendary. Faye never had 
to herd her cattle, she just called them and they followed. She spent as much 
time on horseback as on foot and was an expert horsewoman. Faye had many 
faithful dogs over her lifetime but Bobbie was her favorite.</p> 
<p>For over 30 years, Faye has ridden her horse in the annual Pagosa Springs 
Fourth of July Parade. Last July 3, she rode for the last time at the age of 99.
</p> 
<p>Faye was the most proud of being a Mormon, a religion that she chose at a 
young age. Faye started a grassroots effort to establish a Ward in Pagosa 
Springs, which had previously been only a branch of the Mormon Church. She was 
also proud of being recruited for the Eastern Star and being made Grand Page.
</p> 
<p>Faye was preceded in death by her parents, Samuel and Leora Teeson, her 
husband, Raymond, her six siblings, and her beloved dog, Bobbie.</p> 
<p>She is survived by: her sons, Raymond L. Brown of Allison and Warren Joe 
Brown of Bayfield; her grandchildren, Twila Faye Brown and Brad Brown of Pagosa 
Springs, Dan Brown of Allison, Cindy Highland and Christy Duran of Bayfield, 
Connie White and Lynn Hood of Cortez, Lance Brown and Carol Fowler of Sandy, 
Utah, Bruce Brown of Dayton, Ohio, Gary Brown of Hemet, California, and Claudia 
Carter of Seattle, Washington; nieces Tinnie Lattin and Ione Patterson of 
Pagosa Springs; and 26 great-grandchildren and 13 great-great-grandchildren.</p>

<p><b>Pirates paste Bayfield 48-7, earn state ranking </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;I'd say 'wow' is a good way to describe it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Such was the postgame summary of Friday night's Pagosa-Bayfield clash from 
head coach Sean O'Donnell after his Pirates crushed the visiting Wolverines 
48-7 in the Intermountain League opener for both squads.</p> 
<p>Initially the contest looked to be a battle of field position, but after 10 
scoreless minutes the Pirates began to take advantage of Bayfield miscues and 
exploded for seven unanswered touchdowns on the way to a 41-point win.</p> 
<p>Due to the lopsided margin, the officiating crew invoked &quot;the mercy 
rule&quot; early in the fourth quarter, which kept the clock running almost 
continuously throughout the remainder of the game.</p> 
<p>Early on, however, Bayfield appeared ready to draw first blood as senior 
quarterback Cody Moore led the Wolverines on a methodical march into the Pirate 
red zone on the game's opening possession.</p> 
<p>But the drive ended inside the Pirate 20 when senior Raul Palmer pounced on 
a fumble and Pagosa took over at their own 17 with seven minutes to play in the 
stanza.</p> 
<p>Neither team could muster much offensively from that point, and punts were 
the norm until Pagosa junior wideout Paul Przybylski returned a Wolverine boot 
to the Pirate 43 late in the quarter.</p> 
<p>Pagosa got on track quickly as senior quarterback Paul Armijo threw to 
Craig Schutz for a gain to the Bayfield 39, then hit Przybylski on consecutive 
strikes to move the Pirates to the 13.</p> 
<p>Sophomore flanker Jordan Shaffer made a one-handed grab to set up first and 
goal at the 5, Armijo capped the drive two plays later with a 1-yard run, and 
Casey Hart kicked the point after to make it 7-0 Pagosa with 41 seconds left in 
the first.</p> 
<p>A pair of completions by Moore and power running from Seth Minton moved the 
Wolverines into Pirate territory on the ensuing possession, but heavy pressure 
on Moore from Pirate senior Marcus Rivas resulted in an interception at the 35 
by teammate Jake Redding.</p> 
<p>Pagosa's lead grew to 13-0 seconds later as junior running back Josh 
Hoffman knifed through the Wolverine defense for a 60-yard score on first and 
10 from the 40, and Hart added the extra point to put his team up 14-0 with 
10:36 till the half. </p> 
<p>The Wolverines set out from their own 22 on their next possession, and 
consecutive penalties soon had Bayfield in punt formation near the goal line.
</p> 
<p>O'Donnell sent heat on the attempt and the kick was blocked by Redding then 
recovered in the end zone by Armijo for six. Hart booted the extra-point and 
the Pirates led 21-0 with 8:23 remaining.</p> 
<p>The meltdown continued for the Wolverines less than a minute later as 
Pirate senior Richard Lafferty gathered in a fumble at the Bayfield 35, and 
Armijo hooked up with Przybylski just outside the 10 on the resulting Pagosa 
first down.</p> 
<p>A false start and sack temporarily pushed Pagosa back to the 25, but 
O'Donnell's middle screen call on third and long seemed to surprise Bayfield, 
and Hoffman was escorted to the end zone by a herd of Pirate blockers.</p> 
<p>Hart once again kicked the point after and the gap widened to 28-0 at the 
six-minute mark.</p> 
<p>Moore returned the resulting kickoff to the Bayfield 35, then worked the 
Wolverines into scoring position at the Pirate 9 via completions to Minton, 
Jacob Posey and Lee Ramsier.</p> 
<p>But a block in the back call pulled Bayfield back to the 20, and the 
Wolverines were moved back another 10 yards as Hart, Armijo and Jake Cammack 
collaborated for a second-down sack at the 30.</p> 
<p>Moore completed a fourth-and-goal pass to Loren Morrison inside the 10, but 
Morrison was stopped by Pirate junior linebacker Bubba Martinez and Pagosa took 
possession at the 4 with 1:29 to play and moved to midfield before the half 
ended with the lead holding at 28.</p> 
<p>The Wolverines executed a successful on-side kick to begin the second half, 
then penetrated to the Pagosa 17 before Pirate sophomore Karl Hujus defused the 
threat with a fumble recovery inside of nine minutes to play in the third 
quarter. </p> 
<p>The Pirates reached the end zone for the fifth time four plays later as 
Armijo rolled right and threw to the flats for Przybylski, who used key 
downfield blocks to jet 70 yards and put his team up 35-0.</p> 
<p>Momentum continued for Pagosa as Redding cut short the ensuing Bayfield 
possession with a sack to force an eventual punt from the Wolverine 33, 
Pryzybylski returned the kick to near midfield and Hoffman broke loose on first 
down to score from 56 yards out to make it 41-0 Pirates at 4:32.</p> 
<p>Hart's PAT kick missed left, but he connected on a seventh attempt early in 
the fourth quarter after a 1-yard scoring run by Corbin Mellette that was set 
up by a Przybylski punt return to Bayfield's 26 on the final play of the third. 
</p> 
<p>With Pagosa now up 48-0 and the mercy rule in effect, Moore led a 
nine-play, 78 yard drive ending with a 7-yard plunge by Minton that prevented a 
shutout.</p> 
<p>Corey Williamson added the PAT that proved to be the game's final marker 
and the contest ended four minutes later with the scoreboard reading 48-7 in 
favor of Pagosa. </p> 
<p>The Pirates racked up over 400 yards of offense in the win, with Armijo 
completing 12 of 13 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns and Hoffman 
carrying six times for 118 yards and three scores. Przybylski hauled in five 
passes for 143 yards and one touchdown.</p> 
<p>Redding led the defense with 14 tackles, followed by Armijo with 11 and 
Shaffer with nine.</p> 
<p>&quot;I told the kids this win probably started Monday,&quot; said 
O'Donnell after the game. &quot;We had our best week of practice in three 
years, and if the kids work as hard as they did this week - who knows?&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, said O'Donnell, it was the most-complete effort of the year, to 
date. &quot;I thought we did a nice job of creating opportunities for ourselves 
on both sides of the ball,&quot; said O'Donnell, adding that the Pirate 
offensive line was especially impressive.</p> 
<p>&quot;My hat's off to our offensive line; they did a great job against a 
tough football team and opened things up for us,&quot; said the coach. 
&quot;And Paul (Armijo) did a nice job finding the open man and spreading the 
ball around. It was just a heck of a lot of fun to watch everything come 
together tonight.&quot;</p> 
<p>The win improved the Pirates' record to 4-1 (1-0 IML) and earned them the 
No. 10 spot in the Class 2A polls, with a pivotal IML contest at No. 6 Monte 
Vista looming Friday. </p> 
<p>With respect to Monte Vista, &quot;They've got another great football team 
over there and they put together a nice win tonight,&quot; said O'Donnell, 
referring to Monte's 47-6 victory Friday at Centauri.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's always a tough place to play, and I know without a doubt they'll 
be playing their fannies off to beat us,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll have to match their intensity play for play or we'll be in for 
a long night,&quot; O'Donnell concluded.</p> 
<p>Game time at Monte Vista High School is set for 7 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Pirates beat Mean Moose for 7th win of season </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Moose were anything but mean Saturday as the Pirate volleyball team 
took a 3-0 win in Alamosa, 25-23, 25-22, 25-14.</p> 
<p>The close scores in the first two games of the match are somewhat 
misleading: The Pirates were clearly the stronger team on offense, using seven 
effective hitters to attack the Mean Moose from all points along the net. 
Alamosa's attack succeeded whenever the Pirates' main defensive weaknesses - 
poorly set blocks and sluggish back-row play - continued to hamper the team's 
performance.</p> 
<p>Alamosa gave the home crowd only one bit of hope in the early portion of 
the first game, tying the score at 9-9. The Moose got four of the points 
courtesy Pirate miscues. Pagosa scored with kills by Caitlyn Jewell, Courtney 
Steen and Lori Walkup who also scored with an ace serve on the way to the tie.
</p> 
<p>The Pirates gained a little distance as Jewell stuffed two Alamosa attacks 
at the net and Kari Beth Faber slammed a kill down inside the block. Walkup was 
pounding the ball from the middle and from outside all day long and crushed a 
cross-court kill to put Pagosa in front 13-10. Spotty Pirate blocking kept the 
home team in the race but the Pirates managed to go in front 23-19 with kills 
from Bri Scott, Jewell and Faber and another ace by Walkup.</p> 
<p>In the rally-scoring format, a 23-19 lead is tough to overcome. Alamosa 
nearly accomplished the feat, getting a point with a kill from outside that was 
unmet by a block or a back-row response. Pagosa went to game point with a serve 
error but an Alamosa kill went out off the Pirate block. A Pirate serve error 
gave up another point and Alamosa closed the gap to 24-23 when another attack 
was not thwarted at the net.</p> 
<p>The Mean Moose comeback was stopped dead in its tracks as Liza Kelley put 
the ball down to end the game. </p> 
<p>The only times the home team would take a lead during the match was at the 
outset of the second game: Alamosa went in front 3-1, then 4-3. Then, the train 
came off the tracks as the Moose surrendered four consecutive points with 
mistakes. A kill and two aces by Steen put Pagosa ahead 10-5.</p> 
<p>The Pirates maintained control throughout the mid section of the game, but 
did not gain the distance necessary to assure the win. Walkup continued to 
blast away for points and Caitlin Forrest slid to the middle for a kill. Faber 
hit an ace and the Pirates led 17-10.</p> 
<p>Again, however, lax defense plagued the Pirates and Alamosa went on a 6-1 
run, succeeding against unclosed blocks, scoring with two aces and putting a 
weak free ball to the floor in front of Pagosa defenders. Suddenly, a somewhat 
comfortable advantage had disappeared and Pagosa was in front 18-16 as the 
endgame began.</p> 
<p>Kelley put a roll shot down for a point but a serve error and a ball hit 
out allowed Alamosa to get within one - 19-18. Both teams gave up a point with 
a mistake before Jewell went outside for a kill. Alamosa answered with a kill 
through the block but Jewell responded with a solo block for a point. The Mean 
Moose scored on a Pagosa back-court error and kept the pace, one point behind. 
Walkup responded with a kill from outside but again the Alamosa outside attack 
found the chink in the Pirates' front-row armor. Pagosa led 23-22 and it was 
either team's game.</p> 
<p>It belonged to Pagosa. Walkup converted a poor pass with a cross-court kill 
and an Alamosa hitting error gave the game to the Pirates.</p> 
<p>The last game of the day provided a glimpse of what the Pirates can do with 
more consistent defense. Alamosa never got close as the Pirates shot out to a 
7-1 advantage with two kills and an ace by Steen and successful attacks by 
Jewell, Walkup and Scott.</p> 
<p>With a 7-3 lead, Scott slid outside and scored, Alamosa committed three 
costly errors, Steen nailed a kill from outside and Walkup hit two consecutive 
aces. Pagosa was in front 14-3 and had a grip on the mid-game play - a point in 
a rally-score game where a team must establish dominance in order to assure a 
win.</p> 
<p>Pagosa gave up three points with mistakes but responded with two points on 
an Alamosa serve error and an ace by Steen. Forrest put a ball down inside the 
Moose block, Walkup killed. Advantage Pirates: 19-9</p> 
<p>The home team got into double figures with a three-point run, two points 
courtesy Pagosa, then let a free ball by Steen drop for a score. On the way to 
game point, at 24-13, Steen put a ball out off the block. Alamosa scored its 
last point of the day with a block before a perfect set went up on the Pirate 
side of the net and Walkup fired a tremendous blast from the middle to end the 
game and the match.</p> 
<p>&quot;We played well again on offense,&quot; said coach Penn&eacute; 
Hamilton, &quot;but we still missed too many serves - seven - and we had to 
adjust on defense. We did that, finally, in the third game and picked up the 
pace.&quot;</p> 
<p>The match at Alamosa was the first in a series of road games against 
non-league foes and the coach likes the scenario.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's nice to play out of league,&quot; she said. &quot;You see 
different things. Alamosa's defense did some digging we didn't see from our 
league teams and hopefully we learned to adjust our defense quicker. We still 
need to get to our blocks and close the blocks, and we'll definitely get the 
chance to see if we've improved as the week goes on.&quot;</p> 
<p>The win left the Pirates with a 7-2 overall record heading to Durango 
Tuesday night for a match with their 5A rivals. That is part one of the test 
Hamilton referred to. </p> 
<p>The second chapter comes Saturday as the Pirates wheel to the eastern 
plains for their annual appearance at the Fowler tournament. During the tourney 
competition, Pagosa will face two top-level teams in perennial 2A power Fowler 
and a very strong 3A Lamar. The fourth team at the event will be La Junta.</p> 
<p>&quot;Fowler and Lamar have great records this season,&quot; said Hamilton, 
&quot;and this will be a good opportunity to evaluate what we need to do before 
we head to second matches with each of our league opponents.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Pirates defeat Demons in 3-2 thriller </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It was a shoot-out.</p> 
<p>And, for most of the evening, neither the Pirate or Durango Demon 
volleyball teams blinked.</p> 
<p>When the long and exciting battle was over, Pagosa left the Demon gym a 3-2 
winner over their 5A opponent, 25-24, 19-25, 22-25, 25-20, 15-11.</p> 
<p>The win boosted the Pirate record to 8-2 (4-0 in league play).</p> 
<p>Pagosa forged two decent leads in the early going in game one - 3-0 and 
9-5. Lori Walkup began the game with a kill - the first of 12 she would record 
in the match. Courtney Steen killed for a second point and Caitlin Forrest 
served an ace. Senior Bri Scott nailed a point off a block and Steen scored 
from the back line.</p> 
<p>Durango made up ground to tie at 10-10 and the teams struggled for the 
advantage through the middle of the game.</p> 
<p>With the Demons in front 18-16, Pagosa put on a burst, outscoring the hosts 
6-1 and moving in front 22-19. The run was set up by some of the best digs of 
the season, most by Steen and Scott.</p> 
<p>Pirate errors stopped the momentum, however, and Durango went ahead 23-22 
courtesy four consecutive mistakes on Pagosa's side of the net.</p> 
<p>Forrest managed to put a roll shot down to tie the score 24-24, but the 
Demons responded with a kill through the block.</p> 
<p>Walkup fooled the Demon defense, placing an off-speed shot over the block 
and Steen blasted a point from outside. A Demon hitting error gave the game to 
Pagosa.</p> 
<p>The home team roared back in the second game, leading from the outset. 
Pagosa's play disintegrated in all phases and a spate of mistakes turned over 
points to the Demons. Durango led 9-2 and never looked back. The home crowd 
sensed victory, but Pagosa fought hard at the end of the game, making the win 
more difficult than many expected.</p> 
<p>Behind 19-10, the Pirates used kills from Scott, Liza Kelley (on a back set 
from Walkup) and Caitlyn Jewell to scrap back to 24-16. Jewell killed off the 
block and scored with a solo block but a Durango kill gave the game to the home 
team. </p> 
<p>Durango moved to the brink of a match win with a victory in the third game, 
again building a substantial lead at the start. The Demons led 8-2 before 
Pagosa made a move, tightening the defense and working the offense more 
effectively. Walkup crunched an overpass and Scott scored with an off-speed 
shot to the hole. Kari Faber killed off the Demon block, Steen hit an ace then 
nailed a point from the back row. The Pirates trailed 9-8.</p> 
<p>Durango answered with a four-point run before the Pirates responded in 
kind. Forrest scored from outside and Pagosa had a tie at 13-13.</p> 
<p>The teams tied at 17-17, 18-18, 20-20 and 21-21, the Pirates getting earned 
points on a block by Jewell and Walkup, a kill by Walkup and a point off the 
block by Scott. </p> 
<p>Durango's 22nd point was a mystery when no call was made as the Demon 
setter grabbed the ball and pushed it over the net for a score. A Demon serve 
error surrendered a point before a three point run gave the home team the game 
and a chance to end the evening with one more win.</p> 
<p>It would not happen.</p> 
<p>Durango again took the early lead, 4-0, but Pagosa struggled to keep apace 
and, despite some passing problems and sets off the net, the Pirates managed to 
hold the Demon advantage to 14-9.</p> 
<p>Durango gave up two points with mistakes and Steen killed for a score. 
Durango scored twice to extend the advantage to 16-12, but that would be the 
last hurrah for the home team.</p> 
<p>Walkup annihilated an overpass to start a five-point Pirate run. Durango 
turned over three of the points with errors, Steen scored the fifth point with 
a kill through the Durango block.</p> 
<p>The Demons managed a miracle point as a free ball dropped at the Pirates' 
feet but Pagosa responded with five more points in a row. Scott scored with an 
off-speed shot over the block, Steen hit an unmanageable serve and Kelley put a 
tip down off the pass. Pagosa led 22-17.</p> 
<p>The teams traded mistakes and, with Pagosa in front 23-20 there were no 
more errors on the Pirates' side of the net. Jewell swung outside for a kill 
then stuffed a Demon hitter.</p> 
<p>If any factor was dominant in the fourth-game victory, it was composure and 
a steadiness that has been absent in some of Pagosa's matches this year. 
Against Durango, the Pirates were unaffected by adversity, determined to 
respond to any situation with strength.</p> 
<p>And it was strength and determination that allowed the team to rebound from 
an 8-2 Demon lead in the fifth game - a game to 15.</p> 
<p>The Pirates closed the gap to 10-9 courtesy Demon mistakes before Jewell, 
the 6-1 middle hitter, tied the shoot-out with a kill.</p> 
<p>The Demons got a point off the block. </p> 
<p>Finally, it was Durango that blinked. </p> 
<p>Jewell roared outside to kill for a point. Then, the one aspect of the 
Pirates' game that had been most erratic this season - blocking - dominated the 
action.</p> 
<p>Jewell and Walkup stole the game and match from Durango as the Demons 
attempted to attack from outside - a move that, with several quick sets in the 
middle - had been a go-to play throughout the match.</p> 
<p>The set went up, the hit was delivered.</p> 
<p>Stuff block: Jewell and Walkup.</p> 
<p>A set went up, the hit was delivered. </p> 
<p>Stuff block: Jewell and Walkup.</p> 
<p>Another hit, another block by Jewell and Walkup. Pagosa was in front 14-11.
</p> 
<p>The final Demon attacker went up to attack in the face of that ferocious 
block and hit ball out to give the Pirates the victory.</p> 
<p>Praising her team's overall play, coach Penn&eacute; Hamilton said 
&quot;It's nice to go five games with a decent team, and win. This is the first 
time we've gone five, and our whole goal was improved passing and serving. If 
we can't do those two things well, we can't beat the good teams. We did it 
better tonight than we have so far this year.</p> 
<p>&quot;I was also pleased to see quite a few dig-set-hits. Our attack was 
greatly improved. That last game was a gut check. I told them they had to get 
every little thing right to win - that if they didn't get them right, Durango 
would use them. They got them right.&quot;</p> 
<p>Saturday will bring even tougher tests and fans will know whether this team 
has taken a permanent step up in its quality of play. The Fowler tournament 
will give the Pirates a chance to face the host Grizzlies - one of the best 2A 
teams in Colorado - and 3A power Lamar, undefeated so far this season and a 
regular state tournament team. La Junta is the fourth team at the tourney. </p> 
<p>Pagosa plays Lamar at 10 a.m. Saturday and goes against Fowler in the next 
match. The Pagosa/La Junta match is the final contest scheduled in round-robin 
play.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day the two top teams from the round robin fight it out 
for first place; the other two teams play for third place.</p>

<p><b>Pirates kick their way over Wolverines 6-2 </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>When you've whitewashed a team once - even if it was shorthanded - you have 
a world of confidence when you play that team a second time.</p> 
<p>And early Tuesday evening, Pagosa displayed the confidence, racing to a 1-0 
lead in just 44 seconds over Bayfield's soccer team on a bitter cold Wolverine 
Stadium field.</p> 
<p>As has become the Pirate signal, the initial call went to the Webb boys. 
Freshman Shon breaking with the ball from midfield and leading senior Moe.</p> 
<p>Bayfield keeper Ryan Wirth, who had an outstanding game, stopped the first 
blast but Moe was right there for the rebound and drilled it.</p> 
<p>That was the end of Pirate offensive action for some time to come, and it 
seemed to steam up the homestanding Wolverines.</p> 
<p>After a pair of Pirate attacks went for nought, Bayfield evened the score 
at 1-1 just 3:33 into the game on a Juan Guzman drive from the right wing.</p> 
<p>The Pirates became listless for several minutes, settling on long outlet 
kicks to no one, and counting on defense to save the moment.</p> 
<p>The defenders responded to the challenge, time and again turning away 
Bayfield drives while their own offense appeared to have been blown stagnant by 
the 40 mile per hour wind whipping into their faces from the north.</p> 
<p>There were brief signs of awareness, such as the Caleb Ormonde move in 
front of goal for a header. But Wirth nailed the ball with a leap and on the 
next possession, Pirate keeper Caleb Forrest was called upon for an equally 
tough stop on Guzman.</p> 
<p>Then Bayfield's Thomaz Rocha missed a header right in front of the net. The 
Wolverines maintained possession and Forrest was forced to end the attack with 
a diving save to his left on Nick Joswick's drive.</p> 
<p>Nearly 20 minutes later, Pagosa came awake, much of the attack being 
contributed by the return of Chris Baum from torn ligaments and a six-game 
hiatus.</p> 
<p>At 23:02 he stole a Bayfield crossing pass and dropped to Keegan Smith. His 
lead to Moe Webb was blocked and Smith's rebound hit the right post. Paul 
Muirhead recovered for Pagosa but his drop to Shon Webb was shanked.</p> 
<p>A minute and five seconds later, Baum hit his first goal of the season and 
gave Pagosa a lead it would not relinquish.</p> 
<p>His drive from the left wing off a cross from Moe Webb, was a perfect loft 
into the upper right corner of the net for a 2-1 Pagosa margin.</p> 
<p>It lasted at that score for just over three minutes.</p> 
<p>And then the Webb boys dismantled the middle of the Wolverine defense with 
a Shon to Moe to Shon give and go that had Wirth baffled and the lead grew to 
3-1 Pagosa.</p> 
<p>Forrest stopped an Erik Ludwig effort off a corner kick on the next 
Bayfield possession before Chris Nobles executed a perfect slide block for 
another Pagosa possession. </p> 
<p>This one led to a blown chance when Jessie Morris' crossing lead to Moe 
Webb was drilled in stride, but over the net.</p> 
<p>Forrest made a routine save on Rocha as the half wound down with Pagosa 
leading 3-1.</p> 
<p>The Pirates came out in the second half with the wind at their backs, the 
sun breaking through, and an apparent new offensive spirit.</p> 
<p>A Keegan Smith to Moe Webb attack resulted in another shot wide right and 
then Wirth made his best play of the game on a Muirhead-to-Webb attack that 
Wirth ripped out of the air for a key save.</p> 
<p>A Bayfield corner kick and header attack was foiled by Forrest and his long 
clearing kick resulted in a Muirhead drive that hit the crossbar.</p> 
<p>Bayfield's Richard Stange, a senior who missed the first game, was thwarted 
three times on the same play at the 55-minute mark, Forrest making two stops 
and Morris coming to his aid for the third.</p> 
<p>After two more Forrest saves, the Pirates were on the offensive prowl 
again. A quick set off a steal by Morris gave Ormonde a header opening but 
Wirth was equal to the challenge. Then a Morris chip over the defenders clipped 
the post and Levi Gill's drive from 40 yards was stopped.</p> 
<p>Then Moe and Shon Webb each was stopped twice as Wirth continued 
outstanding defense.</p> 
<p>But finally the offense clicked on a teamwork effort.</p> 
<p>Muirhead opened the drive with a left-wing steal, evaded two defenders, and 
led to Ormonde racing the middle alley. His drop to Moe Webb left Wirth without 
defense and Pagosa led 4-1 at 67:08.</p> 
<p>After Forrest stopped Rocha, another Muirhead to Moe Webb to Shon teamwork 
move resulted in a shot wide right.</p> 
<p>Again, Forrest stopped a Ludwig effort before a Pirate assault resulted in 
Wirth stopping Webb, a block-takeaway by Gill, and a Kevin Blue-to-Webb-to 
Keegan Smith attack that resulted in another dented post by the still scoreless 
Smith.</p> 
<p>Ormonde, with a looper off a corner kick by Blue at 74:25 made the score 
5-1 for Pagosa as the ball sailed with the wind high over Wirth's head.</p> 
<p>Bayfield got that goal back at 76:37 with Ludwig scoring unassisted after 
Forrest went far out for a loose ball and couldn't get back to the empty net.
</p> 
<p>The final score, 6-2, resulted when Moe Webb broke free at midfield, raced 
the right wing behind a screen from Blue, and dropped a pass to Shon working 
the lane Blue opened. The freshman Webb drilled the shot and Pagosa had hiked 
its Southwest Mountain League record to 5-1.</p> 
<p>They take that mark to Crested Butte for a 4 p.m. game Friday against the 
team which administered the lone league loss, 3-2 in overtime Sept. 17 in 
Golden Peaks Stadium. The Pirates then have a long drive back home to host 
Ridgway in a 1 p.m. contest Saturday.</p> 
<p>Coach Lindsey Kurt-Mason told his squad after the victory he was pleased 
with the second half comeback, but warned players not to let success influence 
performance.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have to be on our game all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't 
let down and let our defense carry the load.&quot; </p> 
<p>&quot;When we play our game, the game we've practiced all week,&quot; he 
said later, &quot;we're hard to beat.&quot;</p>

<p><b>'The Animal' chews up Demon attack in 4-1 Pagosa soccer victory</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>His teammates are calling him &quot;The Animal&quot; this week.</p> 
<p>And after his defensive performance against Durango Oct. 1, the Demons 
might think he was more than just one person.</p> 
<p>Senior sweeper Levi Gill was credited with 16 solo blocks in a 4-1 Pagosa 
soccer victory at Riverview sports complex in Durango.</p> 
<p>Every time Durango mounted an attack, the red-maned animal called Gill 
seemed there to break it up.</p> 
<p>Pagosa keepers Caleb Forrest and Felix Guttierez were called on to make 
only seven saves in the game as time and again Gill and his defensive soulmates 
took the ball away. </p> 
<p>And, as has been their wont in recent contests, the Pirates got on the 
board early, Shon Webb showing the way with a penalty kick at 1:47 that had 
Demon junior keeper Adam Reutschle baffled.</p> 
<p>Then began a 23-minute Pagosa run without scoring, one in which both teams 
played excellent defense, but offensive breakaways were hard to come by.</p> 
<p>Five Pirate shots on goal were stopped and twice Pagosa shooters were over 
the net - a 20-yarder from Moe Webb and a 40-yarder from Jessie Morris.</p> 
<p>A penalty kick by Pagosa's Kevin Blue was wide right and then a two-play 
series resulted in a rare yellow card for Forrest in goal.</p> 
<p>It began with a wipeout block just outside the goal mouth on Pirate 
defender Derek Monks.</p> 
<p>Forrest complained to officials about there being no call. </p> 
<p>Just a minute later Durango mounted a serious attack which Forrest stopped 
on a fine move to blank sophomore Matt Barger.</p> 
<p>But Barger ran headlong into Forrest in the crease after the shot and when 
there was no call, Forrest protested, again.</p> 
<p>The official issued a yellow card, saying, &quot;I'll call the game, you 
take care of goalkeeping.&quot;</p> 
<p>Forrest had to leave the game until the ball changed possession again and 
Guttierez replaced him, making a save of his own in the interim before going 
back out.</p> 
<p>Finally, at 38:57, Pagosa hiked the lead to 2-0 with Moe Webb scoring on a 
drop off a breakaway from the ever present Gill who had stolen a Demon throw-in 
and beat two defenders before passing off.</p> 
<p>The first half ended with Blue's penalty kick from the left wing sailing 
wide left and Chi Hoon Lee's header off a centering pass from Caleb Ormonde 
stopped in goal.</p> 
<p>The second half opened with four consecutive solo blocks by Gill and a save 
by Forrest.</p> 
<p>The latter then made his lone physical error of the game, coming way out of 
net to his right for a loose ball. He was beaten to possession by an attacker 
who reversed the ball inside where freshman striker Grant Hunstiger was all 
alone to cut the score to 2-1 in favor of Pagosa.</p> 
<p>The teams traded kicks with Gill and Barger respectively stealing pass 
attempts.</p> 
<p>At 54:38 the Webb boys were at it again.</p> 
<p>Moe stole a Demon pass just outside the attack zone and raced to the right 
wing. Shon followed and took a drop from Moe to the middle, crossing back to 
his older brother. Moe faked a defender , cut right, and then left the ball 
there for Shon as the defender went with him and Shon drilled the shot for a 
3-1 Pagosa lead.</p> 
<p>On the ensuing possession, Shon had a breakaway off a shanked goal kick but 
his shot was snared by Hunstiger.</p> 
<p>Morris missed a penalty kick from 22 yards, but Gill was everywhere the 
ball went, turning in five consecutive solo blocks wrapped around a Moe Webb 
drive that sailed wide right.</p> 
<p>Paul Muirhead, working the left wing flirted twice with the possibility of 
his third goal of the season. One was stopped by the Demon keeper and the other 
clanked off the post.</p> 
<p>Forrest and Derek Monks combined for a brilliant double stop on the best 
Demon attack of the day at 72:40.</p> 
<p>Barger eluded two defenders on the right wing and drilled a shot Forrest 
batted out but did not control. As three attackers closed on it, Monks appeared 
from nowhere to drill the ball out of the zone and protect the lead.</p> 
<p>Gill took the ball all the way back into the attack zone but his shot was 
wide right.</p> 
<p>But he wasn't done.</p> 
<p>His 16th and final takeaway resulted in the final Pagosa goal.</p> 
<p>Cutting off a Demon drive 40 yards out, he chipped a lead pass over the 
last defender to Moe Webb.</p> 
<p>With 39 seconds remaining on the clock, Webb crossed it ahead to brother 
Shon and he drilled the shot for the final 4-1 Pagosa margin.</p> 
<p>The Pirates played again without regular junior offensive midfielder Chris 
Baum, still recovering from torn ligaments, and without senior midfielder 
Keegan Smith serving a mandatory miss for penalties.</p> 
<p>The Pirates will travel to Crested Butte Friday for a 4 p.m. showdown with 
the only Southwest Mountain League team to beat them - a 3-2 overtime loss in 
Golden Peaks Stadium.</p> 
<p>They then come back home to face Ridgway in Golden Peaks at 1 p.m. Saturday.
</p>

<p><b>Pirate runners get healthy as end of regular season nears </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>With each week, they're a little closer to the goal.</p> 
<p>Pirate cross country runners continued to work toward peak performance, 
competing at the Mancos Invitational Oct. 2.</p> 
<p>The girls' team took second place, finishing behind Bayfield. The boys were 
in fourth place in their field. </p> 
<p>Both teams wait for a full roster of healthy athletes, and coach Scott 
Anderson believes that time could be at hand soon.</p> 
<p>The girls returned Heather Dahm to the varsity lineup at Mancos, after a 
two meet absence. Dahm finished in 12th overall with a time of 22 minutes, 12 
seconds. &quot;Heather was back after being out two races,&quot; said the 
coach. &quot;She ran well.&quot; </p> 
<p>Jessica Lynch ran her second race after being absent due to injury. It was 
the first race in which Anderson gave the sophomore the green light to run 
unrestrained. Lynch was fifth in the field with a time of 21:09. &quot;Jessica 
is still coming back from her injury,&quot; said Anderson, &quot;and she 
performed well.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sophomore Laurel Reinhardt stayed solid at Mancos as the Pirates' No. 2 
runner. Reinhardt was third overall with a time of 19:50.</p> 
<p>Emilie Schur was second in the field. Schur ran the Mancos course in 19:50
</p> 
<p>&quot;I thought our girls made a solid effort,&quot; said the coach. 
&quot;We're getting closer to what we want.&quot;</p> 
<p>Four of five boys' varsity runners set personal-best records at Mancos.</p> 
<p>Senior Otis Rand broke the 19-minute mark for the first time in his short 
cross country career. Rand led the way for the Pirates, taking 13th with a time 
of 18:54.</p> 
<p>Riley Lynch was next up for the Pirates. Lynch was 18th in the field with a 
personal best of 19:11. &quot;Riley ran an outstanding race,&quot; said 
Anderson.</p> 
<p>Orion Sandoval took 28th at Mancos with a time of 19:50 and he was followed 
closely by Isaiah Warren, whose personal best of 19:52 put him in 29th place.
</p> 
<p>Forrest Rackham was the last Pirate to score. Rackham also set a 
personal-best record, finishing 51st with a time of 23:37.</p> 
<p>&quot;The boys did well with their fourth-place finish,&quot; said 
Anderson. &quot;One of their benchmarks is Del Norte, and they got closer to 
them at Mancos. Overall, I'm feeling good about the team. Paul Hostetter should 
run with the varsity in the next meet and the team should be at full strength. 
So should the girls.&quot; </p> 
<p>That next meet is tomorrow, Oct. 8, at Bloomfield N.M. The varsity girls 
leave the start line at 3 p.m., the boys at 3:30.</p> 
<p>&quot;It will be a big field,&quot; said Anderson, &quot;another fast 
field. Emilie will get another look at the girl from Window Rock who beat her 
at Shiprock.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm excited to go down to New Mexico. We'll see some fast teams and 
it will definitely help us get ready for the upcoming league and regional 
meets.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ladies wrap up golf season with two league days, awards ceremony</b></p> 
<p><b>By Lynne Allison</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>A &quot;beat the pro&quot; format was featured by Pagosa Women's Golf 
Association for league day Sept. 21.</p> 
<p>Thirteen ladies turned out on a very cold, windy and rainy day to match 
their golf skills with Pagosa Golf Club pro Alan Schutz.</p> 
<p>The ladies persevered and won eight holes of match play with Schutz before 
the inclement weather canceled the rest of the match.</p> 
<p>League winners were Loretta Campuzano, Audrey Johnson, Cherry O'Connell, 
Josie Hummel, Marilyn Pruter, Barbara Sanborn, Jan Kilgore, Sheila Rogers, Jane 
Stewart, Lynne Allison, Jody Lawrence, Sue Martin and Julie Pressley.</p> 
<p>The association celebrated its last league day of the season Sept. 28 with 
a scramble, playing the Meadows and Pi&ntilde;on courses with a par 72.</p> 
<p>The team of Loretta Campuzano, Nancy Chitwood and Jan Kilgore captured 
first place with a 72; second went to Karen Carpenter, Jane Day, Kathy Giordano 
and Jane Stewart at 73.</p> 
<p>Immediately after the round, the ladies convened at the home of Barbara 
Sanborn for their awards luncheon and general meeting. Award winners for the 
season were:</p> 
<p>- Cherry O'Donnell as most improved golfer (she went from a 21.3 to a 17 
handicap);</p> 
<p>- Cherry O'Donnell, most birdies (5); </p> 
<p>- Sue Martin, most chip-ins (5).</p> 
<p>There was also a &quot;Ringer Tournament&quot; played on the Meadows, 
Pi&ntilde;on and Ponderosa courses with a par equivalent of 107. All league 
members were eligible and began the tournament by posting their scores each 
league day for the courses they played.</p> 
<p>Throughout the season, the participants continued to post their scores each 
time they improved their previous best score for each hole. Each participant's 
total scores for the three courses was then tallied at the end of the season.
</p> 
<p>First flight (14-24 handicap) winners were Jan Kilgore at 107 and Josie 
Hummel at 111;</p> 
<p>Second flight (25-28 handicap) winners were Audrey Johnson at 126 and 
Loretta Campuzano at 127;</p> 
<p>Third flight (39 and over handicap) winners were Robin Alspach at 135 and

<p><b>Playtime has morphed into a digital wonderland for kids </b></p> 
<p><b>By Myles Gabel</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>&quot;What's the matter with kids today?</p> 
<p>&quot;Says market-research guru Ted Klauber: Their lives are so busy, so 
structured, and so infused with digital technology that they have no time for 
fun.</p> 
<p>&quot;When Klauber started this project, he had no initial hypothesis - 
only a commitment to exploring an infrequently asked question: How is digital 
technology (and the lifestyle issues that go along with it) affecting young 
children's &quot;sense of fun, play, and thinking&quot;? After conducting 40 
in-depth workshops with kids (ages 6 to 11) and their parents, Klauber arrived 
at answers that are both refreshing and alarming.</p> 
<p>&quot;'When I was a kid, I'd roam around on my blue Schwinn for hours. 
These kids have daily to-do lists. Some of them have only 20 minutes of free 
time a day.' The obsession among parents with efficiency and productivity has 
trickled down to even the youngest of kids.</p> 
<p>&quot;Playtime has morphed into what Klauber calls a 'digital wonderland - 
a fast-moving, goal-oriented zone that affords &quot;little time for aimless 
fun.' Kids today are focused on competition, on efficiency, and on results. One 
consequence of this development is that their imaginations are beginning to 
atrophy: Play is all about the destination, rather than the journey.</p> 
<p>&quot;'When parents talked to us about their childhoods,' Klauber says, 
'they had a sense of wonderment. They remembered building forts out of pillows 
and blankets. They remembered making up elaborate stories. But because kids 
today have so little free time, and because they're always surrounded by media, 
they don't explore what's off the beaten path. They want their fun to be quick 
and easy. The art of being bored is lost.'</p> 
<p>&quot;Of course, child-development experts have worried for years about the 
impact that television has on creativity. But Klauber's questions - and 
conclusions - go well beyond the standard fare. For one thing, his research 
focused on the impact of relatively new technologies, such as the Internet and 
video games. For another, he looked beyond technology to address the attitudes 
that are reshaping children's lives.</p> 
<p>&quot;Are 'play dates' - with all of their rules and structure - the best 
way for kids to have fun with one another? Is it necessarily a good thing that 
virtual technology allows kids to overcome the physical barriers that are 
associated with childhood? Thanks to computers and video games, Klauber says, a 
seven-year-old can drive a car, fight a war, or hit a 90-mile-an-hour fastball.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Does such freedom from physical limitations produce smarter, faster 
kids? Or does it create what he calls &quot;adults of all ages&quot;? Or 
both?&quot;</p>

<p></p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Our institution </b> </p> 
<p>This week, The Pagosa Springs SUN is 95 years old. On several occasions 
over the years other publications were created; none lasted. The SUN remains 
the voice of Pagosa Country, a traditional American small-community weekly 
newspaper striving to tend to the needs of its readership, remaining close to 
home in its focus.</p> 
<p>Our friend David Mitchell, the late publisher and editor of The SUN, had a 
saying: &quot;This paper is not a business, it is an institution. We are just 
its caretakers.&quot; How true.</p> 
<p>Those of us who work at The SUN are part of a succession of owners, 
publishers, editors, writers, salespeople and printers who have labored 95 
years to fulfil as best they could the mission of the community newspaper. If 
we do our work well, others will someday take our places, maintain the 
institution, perpetuate the tradition. Doing our work well in light of the 
history of The SUN is something we take seriously and we are determined to 
surrender the institution in good condition.</p> 
<p>A look at the morgue books, an analysis of copies of The SUN that go back 
to its creation, provides insights into what caretakers have shared as well as 
how the newspaper has changed. This is a study any reader can undertake, using 
files at the Sisson Library. The changing demographics and economy, the 
shifting concerns and fortunes of the residents of Pagosa Country are evident 
as the pages turn. As they will be evident to anyone who, at some time in the 
future, studies the pages you read today.</p> 
<p>The papers reveal the character of the community clearly. Turn to a page 
from 1915, 1945, 1964, 1972, from the '80s or the '90s and you brush against 
the fabric of community life. There are articles about politics and business; 
columns illuminating diverse interests, experiences and personalities in the 
community - Grange reports of yesteryear, chatty gossip from outlying farm and 
ranch areas, news of subdivisions, stores and banks. You read about local 
residents marching off to wars, about club meetings and charitable activities. 
There are ads touting the goods and services of the time. There are birth 
announcements and obituaries. Some of the surnames you see in an early paper 
are repeated over the years. The sudden appearance of other names and their 
repetition signals the arrival of those who will change the course of the 
community. There are fires, storms, floods, epidemics, accidents. You read of 
marriages, anniversaries. The children of the community are there; school news 
is an ever-present element in the papers over the years. Churches are prominent 
in reports of services and social activities.</p> 
<p>In all but the earliest days of the community The SUN has been the window 
through which one views Pagosa Country. We attempt every week to widen and 
clean that window. We do so with an able staff and input from our readers - the 
other key element in a successful, long-lived small town newspaper. Readers and 
their interests help define what this community newspaper is and what it will 
become. Our Letters to the Editor column is a freewheeling forum. The business 
community values and uses advertising to reach the consumer. Public and legal 
notices are printed as part of a newspaper of record. Meetings are covered, 
photographers chronicle the scenes and faces of the time; our staff responds to 
calls for coverage, to tips about stories. We work to please as many people as 
we can, knowing we can't satisfy everyone. We do our best to be fair. Just as 
our predecessors did. The window remains open and the collaboration between the 
publication and its readers continues.</p> 
<p>The SUN is a enduring institution, serving an energetic community. With 
work, conscience and luck, the institution will survive for another 95 years.

<p><b>Walk facing traffic; it's the law </b></p>

<p>Cramped at a desk all day, your legs aching to be limbered, you think, 
&quot;right after dinner I'll take a walk.&quot;</p> 
<p>Great idea. Great places to do just that abound in Pagosa Country.</p>

walking the wrong side of the street or - in fact - out in the roadway in areas 
where there are no sidewalks.</p> 
<p>Stay on the sidewalks or designated trails as much as possible. When you 
must walk in a roadway because there are no sidewalks available, the law says 
pedestrian traffic must walk toward the oncoming vehicular traffic.</p> 
<p>Thus, if you're walking on Snowball Road, for example, and you're heading 
out of town from where sidewalks end adjacent to the Forest Service 
headquarters, you should be walking on the left side of the road. The theory is 
that if you are facing traffic, drivers will be more likely to see you. Coming 
back to town, you'd walk the opposite side of the road, against oncoming 
traffic - always on the left.</p> 
<p>There are some areas where it is really unsafe to walk - or bicycle - for 
that matter. One of the worst is Piedra Road where there are relatively small 
shoulders, heavy traffic, and little room to escape if you see you're about to 
be hit.</p> 
<p>Substantial shoulders exist in loops from town on heavily-used highways 160 
and 84 and they provide good areas for both pedestrian and bicycle traffic to 
stay out of the main traffic lanes. There are minor exceptions, but they can be 
overcome and good six-plus-mile circular routes out of town and back can be 
found.</p> 
<p>For example, U.S. 160 to U.S. 84 and then toward Chama until you reach 
County 119 (Light Plant Road). Turn there and come back to town along that path 
through the Mill Creek drainage, past the old light plant site, along the 
Catchpole Farm property and you'll soon find yourself back at the Town Hall and 
community center where the sidewalks resume.</p> 
<p>Another fine route and one a little more taxing is up Put Hill to Pizza 
Hut, north a block and then loop back through Pagosa Hills eventually coming 
out on Cemetery Road north of the cemetery itself. About half of that route is 
on graveled streets, but there's much less traffic.</p> 
<p>Either route is a very stimulating walk for almost anyone who needs to get 
the wind in their face, the stresses of the day out of mind, and the muscles 
flexing again.</p> 
<p>Or, if you don't want to worry about traffic, utilize the fine trail system 
right downtown on Reservoir Hill. Trails are marked and trailheads have signs 
detailing the length and difficulty of each route.</p> 
<p>A little common caution is necessary in some highway locations where 
shoulders narrow for a few feet because of road curvature.</p> 
<p>Absolutely never, I mean never, walk down the middle of any road in the 
area where there is likely to be traffic. That's an open invitation to be hit 
because drivers from either direction have no idea where you'll go when they 
attempt to pass.</p> 
<p>The specific law can be found in CRS-42-4-805, Subsection 1. Please don't 
become an injury statistic because you &quot;didn't know.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Life &amp; land in photos of Pagosa Country </b></p> 
<p><b>John Taylor shares his art &amp; his ideas </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>John Taylor has been taking pictures all his life. </p> 
<p>And taking them in Pagosa Country. </p> 
<p>He remembers riding around the Upper Piedra in a horse and wagon, even 
being dumped out of the wagon. He remembers chopping ice from the river for an 
ice house. And when the land around Lake Hatcher was nothing more than a winter 
camp for cattle.</p> 
<p>Nearly everywhere he went he carried a camera. Looking for pattern. Color. 
Landscape. Interesting shots of his favorite mountain - Toner - named after his 
grandfather. </p> 
<p>&quot;I've worn out the lugs where the neck straps attach to the 
camera,&quot; he said, during a recent public presentation sponsored by the 
Forest Service. Despite rain clouds, a small group gathered at the Middle Fork 
Trailhead to hear from Taylor, who has also sponsored a photograph workshop at 
his ranch.</p> 
<p>Phyllis Decker, of the Forest Service, took the blame for the lack of 
sunshine, and after swapping stories for awhile, the group abandoned the idea 
of photographing fall colors - the original intent - and traveled back to 
Taylor's ranch on the Upper Piedra to get a glimpse of his slide show of 
pictures spanning at least two decades.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm not a technical photographer,&quot; he said. &quot;I enjoy taking 
pictures. As I take new ones, I go back through and pick out the ones I don't 
like and keep going. It's just been fun.&quot;</p> 
<p>He started with a box camera when he was young. Black and white only. Made 
his own case so he could carry it around and then glued a yellow filter on the 
front to improve the look of black and white.</p> 
<p>He moved up to a Kodak 35 with a range finder. He got out of photography 
after returning from World War II and then picked it up again once the 
photography club started having an annual contest, &quot;even though I don't 
like some of the winners,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>He continues to focus on landscapes, at times adding in a horse and rider 
somewhere in the shadows. He also likes close-ups of leaves, mushrooms, 
flowers. Things that fill the frame. He often uses roads, fence posts, even 
streams as S-curves and leading lines, taking the viewer farther into the 
frame. Emphasizing depth and size.</p> 
<p>He now owns two cameras, including one that's fully automatic. Only he 
hardly ever uses the automatic features, preferring manual settings instead. He 
also likes rules he can take with him in his head instead of carrying lots of 
extra material.</p> 
<p>For instance, the rule of thirds, which says that placing the center of 
focus for the photograph slightly off center either vertically or horizontally 
will make a more visually interesting photograph.</p> 
<p>Of course, he said, later, coming across a slide of a single aspen, framed 
and centered in the picture, the rules, once you known them are sometimes meant 
to be broken. </p> 
<p>Another photographer once told him a good rule of thumb when looking to 
bring both the foreground and background in focus for something like a large 
group of leaves is to focus about a third of the way in.</p> 
<p>&quot;That's something you can take with you all the time,&quot; he said.
</p> 
<p>Of course, Taylor does take a few things with him. He has the two cameras. 
A wide angle lens and a magnification lens. A couple of filters. A lens brush. 
A handkerchief for keeping the lens clean and a small umbrella. In the rain, he 
said, the umbrella can be used to keep the camera dry. In the sunshine, it can 
be used equally effectively to reduce glare. </p> 
<p>&quot;Get equipment as good as you can afford, but don't buy something 
you're not going to use,&quot; he said. </p> 
<p>A tripod is also handy. Or a fence or rock - almost anything that can help 
keep the camera steady. Horses, Taylor said, don't work well.</p> 
<p>&quot;I've found they fidget too much,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>He takes the camera almost everywhere he goes and also plans trips 
specifically to take pictures at certain times of the year - including a recent 
trip to the Rio Grande. </p> 
<p>&quot;I consider myself fortunate to have lived here so long,&quot; Taylor 
said. &quot;The great colors don't occur every year. I don't know why that 
is.&quot;</p> 
<p>After a good area is located, he suggests &quot;working&quot; it fairly 
hard and using lots of film.</p> 
<p>&quot;I look for patterns, colors, mushrooms, plants all kinds of 
things,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Some plants will look beautiful backlit by the sun. Others are better on a 
cloudy day.</p> 
<p>He also suggests bracketing the exposures, using different aperture 
openings and shutter speeds to ensure the best results.</p> 
<p>&quot;When I first started taking pictures,&quot; he said. &quot;I was so 
conservative with my film. I can't tell you how many times I've kicked myself 
for not taking more shots of the same scene.&quot;</p> 
<p>He also believes in keeping some of his favorite spots a secret.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think photographers should protect their locations so people who 
come after them, or other photographers, get the thrill of exploration.</p> 
<p>&quot;Something else I would tell anybody taking pictures,&quot; he said, 
considering examples of his own flashing by on the projector, &quot;is you 
never know what is going to be a favorite picture. Sometimes the ones you don't 
think are going to be pretty good turn out pretty special.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Pagosa's Past</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Social upgrading took place</b></p> 
<p><b>quickly in the 18th century</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Country today is an amalgamation of three cultures, Anglo, Hispanic 
and Native American.</p> 
<p>For proof, just look at the place names. </p> 
<p>Pagosa is a combination of Ute words meaning smelly water. San Juan is 
Spanish for Saint John. Archuleta County is named for the Hispanic senator by 
the name of Archuleta who pushed the legislation creating the county.</p> 
<p>First non-Indian settlement in Archuleta County was accomplished 
concurrently by Anglos and Hispanics. </p> 
<p>While it is true that Hispanics lived for centuries within a few miles of 
Pagosa Country, they did not settle in what became Archuleta County until the 
Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad was built through the county circa 1880-1881. 
They came in with the railroads and sawmills</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, ancestors of our local Hispanics have lived within a hundred 
miles or so of Pagosa Country since 1598. They were also the first non-natives 
to explore this area and they provided a majority of the place names.</p> 
<p>They had their own Daniel Boone equivalents. For that reason, we have been 
looking at Hispanic history in this area. Our focus has been Abiquiu because it 
was the gateway to exploration of Pagosa Country and to a large extent all of 
western Colorado and Utah.</p> 
<p>New Mexico Hispanics had a number of names denoting ethnicity and the 
casticismo &quot;caste elitism&quot; common to pre-Anglo New Mexico society.</p>
<p>The principal categories of castas were: Mestizos, of mixed Spanish-Indian 
ancestry; Coyotes in the 18th and early 19th century were children of European 
fathers and New Mexican mothers who might be Spanish, Indian or Mestizo. The 
term coyote was used so much more often than mestizo that it appears in many if 
not most cases to be a substitute term. Mulatos were of mixed Spanish-African 
ancestry, and Zambos of mixed Indian-African ancestry. An Indio was a person 
born into a specific tribe or pueblo and the Gen&iacute;zaros, regardless of 
tribal ancestry, were equated with the Pueblos. Nomadic Indians were identified 
as Gentiles. Vecinos were tithe-paying settlers of Espa&ntilde;ola or casta 
status.</p> 
<p>Social upgrading took place very quickly during the 18th century. 
Eligibility for upgrading was determined by the possession of tithable 
property, adherence to the Catholic faith and by behaving like fellow colonials.
</p> 
<p>Trade was important in the lower Chama River Valley. By the time of the 
1776 Dominguez-Escalante trek into Utah, Abiquiu had become the chief center of 
trade with the Utes and hosted an annual trade fair.</p> 
<p>Gen&iacute;zaros who spoke Ute were valued. Many of them had probably been 
raised in Ute homes. Most of this trade was unauthorized and required a 
confidential understanding between the trading parties. The Hispanic traders 
depended on guides who spoke Ute and knew Ute trading practices.</p> 
<p>The Mun&iacute;z brothers may have been Ute captives before coming to Ojo 
Caliente. In the 18th century, Utes were rarely taken into captivity in the 
Chama valley but did capture children from related bands of Great Basin Indians 
to trade with the settlers. Only in the mid-19th century, under pressure from 
United States troops did they begin to hand over their own children to Hispanos 
to raise in their homes.</p> 
<p>Andre Mun&iacute;z must have been fluent in Ute and familiar with Ute 
geography, because he accompanied the expedition of Juan Mar&iacute;a de Rivera 
to Gunnison in 1765. After the Dominguez-Escalante expedition in 1776, he 
continued operating on his own as a trader to the Utes until 1805.</p> 
<p>Another Gen&iacute;zaro who won status as a vecino was Manuel Mestas. For 
years he served the Abiquiu settlers as interpreter in their parleys with the 
Utes. In the 1789 census of Abiquiu, he was enumerated as a Gen&iacute;zaro. 
Several other Gen&iacute;zaros of the same surname, including Guadalupe Mestas 
married to &quot;Jos&eacute; el Apache,&quot; were also listed.</p> 
<p>Manual Mestas was recommended in 1805 for the usual interpreter's pay by 
the governor. On a month-long trip to the Timpanagos Utes (near Provo, Utah), 
the 70-year-old Mestas had recovered a number of stolen horses by parleying 
with the Utes, thus avoiding bloodshed. Three years later, the old man was a 
land owner at La Cuchilla.</p>

concerning these Hispanics has been taken from &quot;Pobladores,&quot; written

<p><b>Rainfall boosts season averages, more expected </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Is Pagosa Country pulling out of its drought nose-dive?</p> 
<p>Not yet, according to the latest drought classifications issued by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, which continue to describe Archuleta County as being 
in a &quot;moderate drought.&quot;</p> 
<p>However, recent rainfall totals and ever-whitening mountain peaks suggest 
the region may be on the verge of earning a more favorable classification from 
the USDA - &quot;abnormally dry.&quot;</p> 
<p>For example, area rainfall for the month of September amounted to 4.36 
inches, well over the month's historical average of 2.06 inches.</p> 
<p>Likewise, rain totals the first week of October equalled 2.02 inches, only 
seventeen-hundredths of an inch shy of the month's average rainfall total of 
2.19 inches.</p> 
<p>Though year-to-date totals are still slightly below average, such amounts 
are beginning to offset the modest monsoon rainfall experienced in July and 
August.</p> 
<p>And after a two-day hiatus today and Friday, additional moisture is 
expected in the coming week.</p> 
<p>According to the latest forecasts provided by the National Weather Service 
office in Grand Junction, mostly-sunny skies and highs in the 55-65 range are 
in today's forecast, along with evening lows in the 30s.</p> 
<p>Friday calls for more of the same, with highs predicted in the 60s and lows 
again expected to fall to around freezing.</p> 
<p>Then the chance for rain enters the weekend forecast, as Saturday and 
Sunday are expected to bring increasing clouds, a 30- to 40-percent chance for 
showers or thunderstorms, highs near 60 and lows in the 30s.</p> 
<p>The forecasts for Monday and Tuesday include a 30-percent chance for 
widespread showers, highs in the upper 50s to mid-60s and lows in the upper 20s.
</p> 
<p>Wednesday should bring a return to clear skies but cooler conditions, with 
highs forecast in the 50s and lows predicted to drop below freezing.</p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week in Pagosa Springs was 60 
degrees. The average low was 34. Moisture totals amounted to 2.02 inches.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the area fire danger as &quot;low.&quot; 
</p> 
<p>For updates on current fire danger and federal fire restrictions, call the 
Pagosa Ranger District office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow through town ranged from a low of about 210 cubic feet 
per second to a high of approximately 430 cubic feet per second last week.</p> 
<p>The river's historic median flow for the week of Oct. 7 is roughly 90 cubic 
feet per second.</p>
