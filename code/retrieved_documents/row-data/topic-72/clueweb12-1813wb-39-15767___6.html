<h3> Coral Reef Restaurant Review - Walt Disney World </h3>  Sunday, February 
14, 2010 <br>
<br>
 Recent discussion at the Walt Disney World (for grownups) 
Form prompted me to whip up this post. There has been some debate on whether or 
not eating at the Coral reef is not only worth your time but your money as 
well. I say no - we ate there last trip and were very disappointed.<br>
<br>
 
Here is the review:<br>
<br>
 After experiencing the Nemo ride and checking out 
the aquarium for a bit, we decided to head over to theCoral Reef restaurant. We 
were a bit early but it was fine, we just sat outside the restaurant for a bit 
and relaxed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 We had been looking forward to this 
meal for so long. I will admit, when we got inside I was a bit surprised, it 
wasn't the atmosphere I expected.<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was dreary inside. The dark 
colors coupled with dim lighting made everything seem drab. I realize it was 
supposed to mimic being in the ocean and well, obviously the ocean isn't bright 
and colorful...or is it? Ha!<br>
<br>
<br>
 This is where we sat: <br>
<br>
<br>
Wasn't a bad seat but of course we would have loved to have been closer to the 
aquarium. The kids were fairly well behaved. We didn't order an appetizer as we 
had the dining plan and well, appetizers aren't included in the plan.<br>
<br>
 
The entrees were disappointing. The portions were very small. Now, maybe 
because I am used to larger portions, what we were given might have been what a 
'normal' portion should be? That's fine but when you have a child who is under 
3 and is not able to be on the meal plan, you are told you can share entrees 
with them. I really didn't have anything to share with Wyatt so I wound up 
having to order something for him and paying out of pocket.<br>
<br>
 On the 
bright side, the food was tasty but for the portions, I think it was 
overpriced. I got Seared Sterling Salmon - with ratatouille$23.99, Fawn got 
Wild Mushroom Lasagna - roasted wild mushrooms, wilted arugula and spinach, 
fortina, parmesan, mascarpone and ricotta cheese, rustic tomato ragout$16.99 
and CJ got Grilled New York Strip Steak - served with roasted potatoes, 
watercress and tomatoes tossed in caramelized shallot vinaigrette$30.99 <br>

<br>  For dessert, I ordered the famous 'Chocolate Wave' - served with brandied 
cherries$7.99 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was yummy but wow, $7.99?! Oh well, 
eating here was an experience I will always remember but I know we will not go 
back. There are so many other restaurants we would love to try and of course, 
we have our favorites so the Coral Reef was a once and done.<br>
<br>
<b>THE 
FLIP SIDE</b> <br>
 Gray, author of SoloFriendly.com, left a comment that I 
feel is worth adding to this post:<br>
<br>

<blockquote> You've got a good point here. I really enjoyed my experience 
here, but that's because I'm a solo adult. I would have to say that this 
restaurant is really better suited to adults dining without children than those 
dining with them.While the aquarium is a big draw for kids, it becomes 
difficult to contain children sometimes who want to run up to the glass and see 
the fish. Which then bothers people dining next to the glass. Or you wind up 
disappointed because the kids can't see as well as they want because they're 
sitting across the room. Whereas I was in the middle of the room, and that was 
a fine view for me. And as you say, the portion sizes are what I would call 
&quot;normal&quot;, certainly not the usual Disneysized portions, so while 
perfect for my appetite, I wouldn't have been able to share it with anyone 
without walking away hungry. But they cost the same as Disneysized portions, so 
not the best bargain for a family. What you found to be &quot;dreary&quot; 
decor, I found to be typical adult restaurant colors and soothing, dim 
lighting. Not your typical Disney themed restaurant with bright colors that 
would appeal to families with children.<br>
<br>
 In a way, I wish Disney would 
categorize their restaurants a bit more to help guide visitors (which 
restaurants are appropriate for families with children, and which are best for 
groups without children), so it's easier to choose which restaurants will be 
best for you. I know this isn't the case for you, but many families will only 
go to WDW once in their lifetimes, and I'm sure they want to make sure it's the 
best possible experience without any disappointments.<br>

<p>Gray - what a great response! You really made some excellent points (as 
always!) I am going to copy your response and add it to my post, with a link to 
you of course!</p> </dd>

<p>As of right now we have a reservation for the Coral Reef restaurant, but 
I've been on the verge of telling my hubby to cancel it anyway. I'm not too 
fond of their children's menu options, I have a very picky little girl and I'm 
not sure if she'd like any of the options. I also wasn't really wowed by the 
adult menu, I was just interested in seeing the aquarium. Though I didn't think 
about being on the other side of the restaurant. There are few other places we 
were interested in, so I think we'll be checking out our other options.<br>
I 
do have one question though, you said you couldn't get an appetizer on the 
dinning plan, is that just a certain dinning plan or all of them. This is going 
to be our first time with the dinning plan, so were just trying to get all the 
information we can. From what I saw on the Disney website the Deluxe plan gives 
you an appetizer but I just want to make sure there is no hidden technicality.

<p>Hey Jessica,<br>
<br>
We had the regular dining plan, not the deluxe - the 
deluxe does come with an appetizer.<br>
<br>
The Coral Reef really isn't 
exciting and fun for kids - my ids had more fin checking out the aquarium on 
the other side - it's HUGE; so by the time we got to diner they weren't 
interested in seeing fish anymore, :-D<br>
<br>
I will say - just the regular 
dining plan was not worth it for us - maybe we just didn't plan it right? Ha! I 
could not see having the deluxe plan thought - that is a lot of food!<br>
<br>

Here is my experience with the dining plan:

<p>Thanks, Hubby called today to cancel the reservation for the Coral Reef, we 
got a different reservation in place of it at Teppan Edo. We have a similar 
restaurant close to us that we all love, so I feel better about trying them 
out. Hubby doesn't like fish too much anyway, so he was more than ok with 
canceling the reservation.<br>
I think some of the dinning plan will be a bit 
much, but overall I think it will eliminate the anxiety we get sometimes about 
not wanting to try something new or too expensive. Also this way we can do the 
table service breakfast everyday that we liked last time :) We've also made 
reservations for almost every meal for everyday we are down there, I suppose 
we'll see if it's a bit much :-D</p> </dd>

How old are your kids? Where else are you eating? The BEST dinner 
we've had was at 1900 Park Fare at the Grand Floridian. Great food and fun 
character interaction.<br>

<br>We're going again this year!<br>
<br>
Last year I had meals planned every 
day - including breakfasts and I found that too be too stressful. Always having 
to be somewhere at a certain time. This ear we only have 1 meal reservation a 
day (and not every day)</p> </dd>

<p>My daughter is 4, and last year we tried Le Cellier and Tony's for the 
first time, and we've made reservations for both of them this time. We also 
have reservations at my favorite place, Yak and Yeti. We are doing breakfast at 
Whispering Canyon almost everyday, except for the last at Ohana. We've done the 
best friends breakfast the last two times and loved it. We are going to try 
Chefs de France and Wolfgang Puck too. I think we have 2 or three meals that we 
don't have reservations for. For the one day in the Magic Kingdom though we 
plan to eat at Pecos Bill's, we always make a point to eat there at least once 
during a trip.<br>
I also want to add that the more I come to your blog, the 
more I think I made a mistake of putting my mommy blog on wordpress.</p> </dd>

<p>OOOhhh definitely try Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe in the Magic Kingdom - 
it's quick service. What/Where is Tony's? We've never eaten at Pecos Bill's but 
we may try it this year!<br>
<br>
When in May are you going? Where are you 
staying?<br>
<br>
Why do you think you made a mistake putting your blog on 
Wordpress?</p> </dd>

<dd> 
<p>We've eaten at Cosmic Ray's, they're good too. Tony's is right in the front 
of Magic Kingdom, right by the photo place.<br>
We're staying at the Wilderness 
Lodge Resort, and we're going down on May 10th.<br>
I have a blog on blogger, 
but I had wanted to try Wordpress, but I just don't understand how to work most 
of it. Also I feel like I get next to no traffic, though I don't get much 
traffic on my art blog either. Of course the lack of traffic could be due to my 
lack of blogging skills (I'm working on improving though). :)<br>
I like all 
the extras you have on this, and I could barely get the one badge up. Also I 
tried Wordpress because when I asked for advice on my website a lot of people 
told me to just make a Wordpress site, and have my blog and website in one 
place. Right now I know for sure I wouldn't like that, and I'm not sure if I 
want to start my mommy blog over somewhere else or not.</p> </dd>

<p>I can't believe I didn't know about Tony's! Hahaahaaa! Have you ever stayed 
at WL before? We ate at Whispering Canyon last year for breakfast, it was nice. 
My heart will always be with the Polynesian, even though we now own at Bay Lake 
Tower!<br>
<br>
I like your artist blog - I follow it :) I didn't know you had 
a mommy blog? I thought we were friends on Facebook but I can't find you there 
now&gt;?<br>
<br>
I HATE Wordpress but the SEO company I work for hosts all 
their blogs on WP as well as many client websites, they swear by it. I have to 
deal with WP blogs for my job and I am so happy to blog on my blogger blogs :)

<p>I don't know what happened on facebook but I went back and added you. We 
stayed at the Wilderness Lodge last time, and I love the Polynesian, but I've 
never stayed there. Hubby used to stay there all the time growing up, it's his 
mom's favorite.<br>
I think I'm going to see about making a mommy blog on my 
blogger account, a few people seem to have more than one blog through one 
blogger account. I think I'll keep the two going for awhile then delete one 
when I decide I like it better.</p> </dd>
