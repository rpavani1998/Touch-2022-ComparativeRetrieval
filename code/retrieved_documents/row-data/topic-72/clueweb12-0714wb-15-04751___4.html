<p> </p> 
<p> <br>
Heads Up - Know the Code, It's Your Responsibility </p> 
<p>The Keystone Skier and Snowboarder Responsibility Program is designed to 
communicate, educate and enforce the basics of responsible, courteous skiing 
and snowboarding as outlined in Your Responsibility Code and the Colorado Skier 
Safety Act.</p>

<h3>Ski Safety</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <strong>1. </strong>Your Responsibility Code Keystone is committed to 
promoting skier safety. In addition to people using traditional alpine ski 
equipment, you may be joined on the slopes by snowboarders, telemark skiers or 
cross-country skiers, skiers with disabilities, skiers with specialized 
equipment and others. Always show courtesy to others and be aware that there 
are elements of risk in skiing and snowboarding that common sense and personal 
awareness can help reduce. Know your ability level and stay within it. Observe 
&ldquo;Your Responsibility Code&rdquo; listed below and share with other skiers 
the responsibility for a great skiing experience.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Always stay in control, and be able to stop<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or avoid other people or objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. People ahead of you have the right of way.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is your responsibility to avoid 
them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. You must not stop where you obstruct a trail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or are not visible from above.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Whenever starting downhill or merging into a 
trail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look uphill and yield to 
others.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Always use devices to help prevent runaway 
equipment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Observe all posted signs and warnings. Keep off
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; closed trails and out of closed 
areas.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Prior to using any lift, you must have the 
knowledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and ability to load, 
ride and unload safely.</p> 
<p>Be advised that Keystone does not mark all potential obstacles or hazards. 
When marked, poles, flags, fencing, signage, padding or other forms of marking 
are used to inform the skier/rider of the location of a potential obstacle or 
hazard. These markers are no guarantee of your safety. It is part of your 
responsibility under the Your Responsibility Code and the Colorado Ski Safety 
Act to avoid all obstacles and hazards.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
2. </strong>Colorado Ski Safety Act. The Colorado legislature, 
recognizing risks that are inherent in the sport, has passed the Colorado Ski 
Safety Act, which provides inherent risks of the sport and relative 
responsibilities of the &quot;skier&quot; and the ski area. You must obey the 
Act. Under the Act, any person using the facilities of a ski area is considered 
a skier. A summary of the inherent risks is listed below:</p> 
<p><strong>WARNING<br>
</strong>Under Colorado law, a skier assumes the risk 
of any injury to person or property resulting from any of the inherent dangers 
and risks of skiing and may not recover from any ski area operator for any 
injury resulting from any of the inherent dangers and risks of skiing, 
including: changing weather conditions; existing and changing snow conditions; 
bare spots; rocks; stumps; trees; collisions with natural objects, man-made 
objects, or other skiers; variations in terrain; and the failure of skiers to 
ski within their own abilities.</p> 
<p>The Ski Safety Act was amended in 2004 to include CLIFFS, EXTREME TERRAIN, 
JUMPS AND FREESTYLE TERRAIN as inherent dangers and risks of the sport.</p> 
<p>Skiers and Riders should be advised that a green circle, blue square or 
black diamond at Keystone is not necessarily the same as a green circle, blue 
square or black diamond at other resorts. The system is a relative rating of 
trails at each resort and does not compare trail difficulty between resorts. 
Skiers and Riders should begin with the easiest terrain and then move up in 
difficulty as their ability permits in order to understand the relative rating 
at Keystone.</p> 
<p><strong>EXTREME TERRAIN</strong> <br>
Extreme Terrain contains cliffs, very 
steep slopes as well as rocks and other hazards. Skiing or boarding Extreme 
Terrain is for EXPERTS ONLY.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><br>
3.</strong> Freestyle Terrain Areas are designated with an 
orange oval and may contain jumps, hits, ramps, banks, fun boxes, jibs, rails, 
half pipes, quarter pipes, snowcross, bump terrain and other constructed or 
natural terrain features. Prior to using Freestyle Terrain, you are responsible 
for familiarizing yourself with Freestyle Terrain and obeying all instructions, 
warnings and signs. Freestyle skills require maintaining control on the ground, 
and in the air. Use of Freestyle Terrain exposes you to the risk of serious 
injury or death. Inverted aerials are not recommended. You assume the risk.</p> 
<p>Freestyle Terrain has designations for size. Start small and work your way 
up. Designations are relative to this ski area.<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAKE A PLAN.</strong> Every time you use 
Freestyle Terrain, make a plan for each feature you<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to use. Your speed, approach and takeoff will 
directly affect your maneuver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and landing.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.</strong> You are 
responsible for inspecting Freestyle Terrain before initial use<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and throughout the day. The features vary in size and 
change constantly due to snow conditions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weather, 
usage, grooming and time of day. Do not jump blindly. Use a spotter when 
necessary.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EASY STYLE IT.</strong> Always ride or ski 
in control and within your ability level. Do not attempt Freestyle<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrain&nbsp;unless you have sufficient ability and 
experience to do so safely. You control the degree<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of difficulty you will encounter in using Freestyle 
Terrain, both on the ground and in the air.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPECT GETS RESPECT. </strong>Respect 
Freestyle Terrain and others. Only one person on a feature<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a time.&nbsp;Wait your turn and call your start. 
Always clear the landing area quickly. Respect all<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signs and do not enter Freestyle Terrain or use 
features when closed.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
4.</strong> Electronic Devices. Keystone discourages the use 
of electronic devices &ndash; cell phones, music players, or earphones &ndash; 
while skiing and snowboarding, or loading and unloading lifts.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
5.</strong> Lift Safety. Under Colorado law, you cannot board 
a lift unless you have sufficient physical dexterity, ability and knowledge to 
negotiate or to use such lift safely or until you have asked for and received 
information sufficient to enable you to use the lift safely. You may not use a 
lift or any ski trail when under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
6.</strong> CAUTION &ndash; snowcats, snowmobiles and 
snowmaking may be encountered at any time.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
7.</strong> Slow Zones. Certain areas (indicated on the map in 
yellow) are designated as SLOW ZONES. Please observe the posted slow areas by 
maintaining a speed no faster than the general flow of traffic. Space and speed 
are especially important in these areas. Fast and aggressive skiing will not be 
tolerated.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
8.</strong> Helmet Use. Keystone encourages our guests to 
educate themselves on the benefits and limitations of winter sports helmets. 
Regardless of whether or not you choose to wear a helmet, every winter sport 
participant shares responsibility for his or her safety and for that of others 
using the ski area facilities.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
9.</strong> Backcountry Warning. Pursuant to the Colorado Ski 
Safety Act, the ski area assumes no responsibility for skiers going beyond the 
ski area boundary. To access the backcountry, use designated gates only. Areas 
beyond the ski area boundary are not patrolled or maintained. Avalanches, 
unmarked obstacles and other natural hazards exist. Be aware: the backcountry 
avalanche hazard may be extreme. Rescue in the backcountry, if available, is 
the responsibility of the Summit County Sheriff. It will be costly and may take 
time.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
10.</strong> High-Altitude Environment. Some visitors may 
experience symptoms associated with [Resort Name]&rsquo;s high altitude. 
Symptoms may include headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, restless sleep, 
coughing and difficulty in breathing. If symptoms persist or if you have a 
concern about your health, you should seek medical attention.</p>

<h3>Terrain Park Safety</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> View Smart Style Video </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Know your Limits and ability level and select the 
appropriate Freestyle Terrain for you.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Your condition, speed, balance, body movements, 
alignment, trajectory and maneuver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
difficulty will DIRECTLY AFFECT YOUR DESIRED OUTCOME.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Know the intended use of the Freestyle Terrain 
you have chosen. For example, some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; features 
are intended to be used in a series with no stopping and some individually<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with stopping areas; jump takeoffs are for 
jumping and rail takeoffs are for entering onto rails.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Your actions can take you out of balance and 
cause serious injury or death, no matter how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
the feature is designed or where you land. Land on your feet!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Transitions are changes in the shape and pitch of 
the snow or feature, or changes from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one 
type of sliding surface to another. Transitions can be gentle or abrupt, and 
demand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that users be alert and respond to 
them with accurate movements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Know where to Land. The SWEET SPOT is between the 
&quot;knuckle&quot; and center of the landing zone.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you land on or near the sweet spot, you 
can still be seriously injured or die if your landing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; posture is not correct.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; INVERTED MANEUVERS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; BE AWARE that features change constantly due to 
snow conditions, weather, usage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grooming 
and time of day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Read and obey all posted signs, instructions and 
warnings before using Freestyle Terrain.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Some 
resorts designate features as small, medium and large. Be aware these ratings
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are determined by size, not degree of 
difficulty, and are relative only to that resort.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<strong><br>

FOUR MAIN POINTS OF SMART STYLE:</strong> 
<p></p> 
<h3>1. Make a Plan</h3> 
<p> <br>
Every time you use Freestyle Terrain, make a plan for each feature 
you want to use.</p> 
<p>Your speed, approach and takeoff will directly affect your maneuver and 
landing.</p> 
<h3>2. Easy Style It</h3> 
<p> <br>
Know your limits and ski/ride within your ability level</p> 
<p>Look for small progression parks or features to begin with and work your 
way up</p> 
<p>Freestyle skills require maintaining control on the ground and in the air
</p> 
<p>Do not attempt any features unless you have sufficient ability and 
experience to do so safely</p> 
<p>Inverted aerials increase your risk of injury and are not recommended</p> 
<h3>3. Look Before You Leap</h3> 
<p> <br>
Before getting into freestyle terrain observe all signage and warnings
</p> 
<p>Scope around the jumps first not over them</p> 
<p>Use your first run as a warm up run and to familiarize yourself with the 
terrain</p> 
<p>Be aware that the features change constantly due to weather, usage, 
grooming and time of day</p> 
<p>Do not jump blindly and use a spotter when necessary</p> 
<h3>4. Respect Gets Respect</h3> 
<p> <br>
Respect the terrain and others</p> 
<p>One person on a feature at a time</p> 
<p>Wait your turn and call your start</p> 
<p>Always clear the landing area quickly</p> 
<p>Respect all signs and stay off closed terrain and features</p> 
<h3>Know the Code</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Be sure you Know the Code: You're Responsibility Code provides safety tips 
while on the slopes. Smart Style is a terrain park specific safety program that 
you should check out before using terrain parks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Each feature can be broken down into 4 zones. 
Identify these zones and have a plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before 
using any Freestyle Terrain.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Approach zone is the space for setting your speed 
and stance to use the feature.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Takeoff zone is for making moves that start your 
trick.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Maneuver zone is for controlling your body in the 
air and setting up for landing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Landing zone is the prepared slope between the 
knuckle and the runout beyond it.</p> 
<p>Skiing and snowboarding can be enjoyed in many ways. At ski areas you may 
see people using alpine, snowboard, telemark, cross country and other 
specialized ski equipment, such as that used by disabled or other skiers. 
Regardless of how you decide to enjoy the slopes, always show courtesy to 
others and be aware that there are elements of risk in skiing that common sense 
and personal awareness can help reduce. Observe the code listed below and share 
with other skiers the responsibility for a great skiing experience.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Always stay in control.</p>

<h3>High Altitude Awareness</h3> 
<p> <br>
Above 8,000 feet, altitude illness affects 20 percent to 30 percent 
of visitors from low elevations to some degree. The first thing most people 
notice is a shortness of breath, especially when exercising. In addition, the 
heart is likely to beat faster and one may develop nausea, unusual tiredness, 
headache, or have difficulty sleeping. Those with one or more of these symptoms 
may have Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). If the symptoms do not subside shortly, 
a doctor should be called. Upon arrival in this area, take it easy for the 
first day or two. Drink two or three times more water or fluid than usual. 
Limit alcohol consumption for two or three days and minimize caffeine intake. 
Limit salty foods and increase carbohydrate consumption. Most importantly, 
listen to your body. Do not push the limits of your physical capabilities.</p>
