<p>Learning a Foreign Language &raquo; Foreign Language &raquo; Long-Term 
Benefits Of Studying A Foreign Language</p> 
<h1>Long-Term Benefits Of Studying A Foreign Language</h1> 
<p>Write-up by David Sims</p> 
<p>When kids are 1st presented with a course of study in a second language, 
they typically discover they take pleasure in the expertise at first, but then 
when the hard work sets in, they want out. Given their comparatively limited 
experience in life, they frequently can not foresee any practical uses of 
knowing and being able to speak this new language they are learning. This is 
particularly sad, given that childrens&rsquo; young minds do so well with 
learning new issues like languages.</p> 
<p>A similar situation occurs very often when parents &ldquo;expose&rdquo; 
their youngsters to music, usually with piano lessons or possibly enrolling 
their child to play in a school band. Just when the musical understanding curve 
begins to steepen, the children (with their aggravated parents&rsquo; support) 
demand to drop lessons. All of a sudden, their previous &ldquo;interest&rdquo; 
evaporates.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Of course, in both instances what is at work is a very natural human 
tendency to balk at exertion. Humans of all ages basically rationalize that 
their interest has waned, when what is in fact happening is that they have 
reached a plateau point&hellip;a point where extra exertion is needed to 
overcome a given set of challenges in the study. At that point, the human mind 
is loathe to look down the road to the future, to visualize any tangible 
rewards to continuing with the course of study. It all appears like just too 
much work.</p> 
<p><b>Redefining Enjoyable</b></p> 
<p>We all want to have enjoyable in life, for each and every moment to be 
enjoyable or at least not too demanding of our energies. Even so, if we cave 
into these feelings and let our minds rationalize that we are losing interest 
due to the fact what we are studying is no longer &ldquo;enjoyable,&rdquo; then 
we lose a extremely great chance.</p> 
<p>As parents we want to find approaches to help our children redefine fun. We 
ourselves can benefit just as a lot when we objectively assess our own 
situations in life. By redefining &ldquo;fun&rdquo; to be a sense of 
satisfaction after challenge, triumph soon after exertion, we can turn nearly 
any activity in which we are engaged into &ldquo;enjoyable.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><b>Searching Back in Hindsight</b></p> 
<p>How many adults look back and rue the truth that they dropped their piano 
lessons. That they quit their German class just as they had been beginning to 
truly be able to speak the language.</p> 
<p>There are many lengthy-term advantages to foreign language study, but those 
rewards will never be conferred if progression in the course of study is 
abruptly ended.</p> 
<p><b>Keeping a Sense of Perspective</b></p> 
<p>As parents of kids studying a foreign language, we will need to support 
them to see ahead&hellip;to see those lengthy-term positive aspects of 
realizing one more language, or possibly two or three other languages. In other 
words, we require to function as our childrens&rsquo; eyes, as it had been. We 
will need to present perspective in the form of communicating verbally and 
clearly that there is indeed challenge in life&rsquo;s activities, but that 
from the perspective of an whole life (not just a childhood) there will be 
pleasure and a deep sense of accomplishment if they hang in there.</p> 
<p>There will also be really practical rewards which can enhance the top 
quality of life, open up otherwise unattainable opportunities, provide chances 
for increased economic security, and deepen understanding of our fellow man and 
our shared human state.</p> 
<p>(Naturally, these truths hold true for adult learners as a lot as they do 
for child learners, and we adults require to remind ourselves to keep long-term 
perspective alive as well.)</p> 
<p><b>Practical Benefits of Studying a Foreign Language</b></p> 
<p>A lot has been said of the advantages of language study in an ever much 
more globalized world. The arguments for studying languages in order to thrive 
in modern-day enterprise are compelling.</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, there are other equally important rewards of studying a second 
language.</p> 
<p><b>Getting Personal</b></p> 
<p>As a kid, I first studied Spanish in Junior High School. Like a lot of 
kids, that was basically the language offered and it was required. I&rsquo;m 
not positive I enjoyed understanding Spanish, but I did sense my mind opening 
up. Suddenly my brain was hearing all new sounds, new nuances, new emphases. At 
as soon as the world seemed like a significantly bigger location than before, 
and but (paradoxically) it also seemed far more inside my grasp and in that 
sense became a lot more intimate and less intimidating.</p> 
<p>As my mind opened up, I found to my amazement that I could reason in a new 
language whose grammar and construction were different from my own language of 
English. The world seemed to grow to be more three-dimensional, I could see it 
from one more vantage point. I began dreaming in Spanish&hellip;wow!</p> 
<p><b>Times 3</b></p> 
<p>This expertise repeated itself when I was thrust into a third-year French 
class at a new school. As far as the powers that be at the new school had been 
concerned, I was a certain age and in a particular grade, so I would be in 
French three regardless of whether or not I&rsquo;d ever seen or heard a word 
of it prior to. I persevered, due to the fact I was forced to persevere by an 
external entity (the school) and because I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to &ldquo;lose 
interest&rdquo; as discussed at the beginning of this post, I produced it over 
that plateau point and there were good issues on the other side&hellip;there 
had been lengthy-term positive aspects.</p> 
<p>Again when I studied Russian with the local college professor each and 
every week in her residence. My dad and brother and I went weekly to learn this 
extremely different language, complete with its cyrillic alphabet and one more 
set of new sounds. We would sit at her dining room table and read elementary 
school primers in Russian, and we would tune into Radio Moscow with her 
shortwave radio.</p> 
<p>And finally again when I took German in High School. (By this time, as you 
may guess, I was truly beginning to take pleasure in languages. I was beginning 
to have &ldquo;enjoyable.&rdquo;)</p> 
<p><b>The Positive aspects, As Promised</b></p> 
<p>So what had been my long-term advantages of studying a foreign language? 
Well for starters, my understanding of my own English language grew 
substantially: by learning different distinct grammatical constructions (and 
the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; thought processes behind them), I came to have a far 
more mature understanding of the use of English structure, grammar, and style 
(and, in turn, the thought processes behind them).</p> 
<p>The farther I went in learning other languages, the far more other nations 
and peoples all around the globe became solid and real, and gradually those 
other nations and those other peoples were transformed into parents and 
children just like my family members. That realization of similarity is 
something the world cannot have too much of. With out a sense of shared 
humanity, nations merely compete, conquer, and kill. Studying foreign languages 
gave me a sense of connection with other peoples, and that sense helps me to 
see other peoples and other nations much more clearly nowadays.</p> 
<p>Are these advantages &ldquo;fun&rdquo;? When I was a kid, I probably would 
have said not. Even so, I think these advantages have entirely moulded me into 
a diverse becoming. A individual who has far more compassion for folks around 
the world, due to the fact I&rsquo;m not so frightened of them. Contrary to 
what we have been told all our lives, ignorance is not bliss.</p> 
<p><b>Practical Advantages Too</b></p> 
<p>Yes, there were also practical rewards to studying the numerous languages I 
studied: foreign movies became more accessible, novels by foreign authors (even 
in English translation) seemed far more transparent, distinct technical terms 
in music such as &ldquo;allegro non troppo&rdquo; and &ldquo;sehr 
markiert&rdquo; had a greater depth of meaning.</p> 
<p>I uncover, too, that the much more I learned of other languages (whether 
Spanish, French, Russian or German) the much more flexible my mind became. So 
how does flexibility result in any practical value? Well, when I required to 
understand new and very complex software program programs at work &ndash; in 
order to upgrade, and later maintain, my job &ndash; that flexibility helped me 
to understand Photoshop, to understand PageMaker, Dreamweaver, Ventura 
Publisher&hellip;and how to code HTML and CSS and Javascript. After all, 
speaking a foreign language isn&rsquo;t all that different from 
&ldquo;speaking&rdquo; code. But you cannot do it with out a particular 
quantity of flexibility.</p> 
<p><b>It&rsquo;s In no way Too Late to Understand</b></p> 
<p>Studying a new language can indeed be enjoyable. It can present a sense of 
wonder, a sense of accomplishment, a sense of adventure. The practical value of 
realizing another language when travelling abroad or when doing organization in 
a global setting is inestimable. Exercising your brain, developing its 
flexibility, can open up all sorts of new avenues for you.</p>
