<h1>Is Autistic Communication a Language in Itself?</h1> 
<p>From&nbsp;Lisa Jo Rudy, About.com Guide&nbsp;&nbsp; November 3, 2010</p> 
<br> 
<p>Last night, I received an interesting response to my blog about a 
&quot;Communication Shutdown&quot; run as a fundraiser for autism.&nbsp; Here's 
the response, from an adult with autism:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>I participated in the Shout-Out, being autistic... Even when I was 
unable to speak as a little kid, according to my parents (both likely 
autistic), I communicated clearly with my eyes and actions; as an adult, while 
my non-autistic ex couldn't 'read' my non-verbal communication, my autistic ex 
definitely could.</em></p> 
<p><em> The shutdown reinforces the myth that just because non-auties don't 
natively understand us, we must not be communicating. It's like declaring that 
because I only know English, immigrants must all be yammering nonsense words. 
Imagine how silly someone would look to you if they did that!</em></p> 
<p><em> Both auties and non-auties only natively communicate with our own 
kind, have to learn the other, and don't pick it up much easier as babies. Most 
autistic folk learn what we can for survival, some non-autie parents do, too. 
That's a lot better than deciding that the only &quot;real&quot; language is 
one's own, and promoting that idea as &quot;awareness&quot; of the people that 
only speak the other kinds...</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>My immediate response was confusion. My own son, who has high functioning 
autism (not Asperger's), has always had a tough time when placed in a group of 
kids with autism. Kids with autism are often louder, more perseverative, and 
more likely to tantrum than typical kids. As a result, a classroom filled with 
children on the spectrum is unlikely to be a relaxed, creative, or even 
predictable place. Even years after leaving that environment, Tom has been wary 
of groups of people on the autism spectrum - because he's concerned they'll 
&quot;bully&quot; him (his interpretation of perseverative name calling) or 
make very loud noises.</p> 
<p>But after thinking about this overnight, I realize that the commenter isn't 
talking about hanging out in groups: he's talking about one-to-one 
communication. His suggestion is that the &quot;language of autism&quot; can be 
likened to &quot;Italian,&quot; in that it's a particular way of communicating 
that can be predicted, replicated, and understood on its own terms by native 
speakers. He even suggests that some non-autistics can learn the language well 
enough to be fluent.</p> 
<p>I have no idea whether there really is a &quot;language of autism&quot; 
that's shared by and understood by a large group of people. What's your take on 
this intriguing idea?</p>

<p>I am endowed with Asperger&#146;s Syndrome.</p> 
<p>I doubt there is a &ldquo;language of autism&rdquo;. I do suspect that some 
autists are much more perceptive about certain aspects of body language than a 
neurotypical.</p> 
<p>I am well aware neurotypicals are looking at facial expressions and body 
language to determine emotional states. I look at eyes to figure out what the 
other person is looking at, with special emphasis on the fleeting glances. I 
don&rsquo;t think autists care about any emotional state other than extreme 
anger, fear or aggression, and they are especially attuned to whether someone 
is glancing at them.</p> 
<p>After a few minutes of watching, I have instinctively separated people into 
a spectrum of those who lack sophisticated awareness of their surroundings, 
(the very neurotypical) and those who are tuned in to the m&eacute;lange around 
them. I have consistently found a strong correlation between these qualities 
and intellectual curiosity. Essentially, without a word being spoken, I can 
walk away from the random subway car and have given everyone on board an IQ 
test, which I know from experience of interaction with random people to be 
fairly accurate.</p> 
<p>I suspect that communication with autistics can be manipulated. I recall my 
mother saying that when she discovered that my Aspie brothers was capable of 
talking, she ignored his needs no matter how much he fussed, and he soon 
started talking in complete sentences. I have taught both of my wife&rsquo;s 
cats to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to me if they want something; they have to come to 
me, &ldquo;talk&rdquo;, show me what they want by going right up to the door or 
their food bowl, and &ldquo;talk&rdquo; again.</p> 
<p>I tailor my E-Mails to those I suspect to be Aspies to cover only a single 
subject; I know from esperience that only the first subject presented in an 
E-Mail will be noticed, and I don&#146;t ever trust someone to walk away from a 
conversation remembering anything.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is a separate language, but like dialects and 
accents, it can tell you where they have come from.</p> </dd>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is a &ldquo;language&rdquo; because language is 
socially constructed. The Deaf aren&rsquo;t born understanding a universal sign 
language- groups of Deaf people gradually created sign language; and different 
groups have created different languages (eg: American Sign is quite different 
from British Sign (and not in the occasionally-amusing way American English and 
British English differ)</p> 
<p>But, I do not think the writer is imagining something in regards to how 
Autistics may connect. I would liken it however to the &ldquo;gaydar&rdquo; 
referred to in queer culture- an instinctual awareness about behaviours related 
to issues/stimuli/etc that are very important to us, or that require our 
careful attention, things that are unimportant to the average person and 
therefore the behaviours connected to them are missed (or misunderstood).</p>

<p>I wish it was really so simple that we could work out a special decoder 
ring and suddenly we&rsquo;d all have a clear understanding of each other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with Alan on this one. A phenomenon my 
son&rsquo;s therapists labeled &ldquo;overselectivity&rdquo; very obviously 
played a key role in many of his difficulties with developing language. He had 
a tendency to get so mired down by the individual details of objects that he 
wouldn&rsquo;t classify and sort them into larger groups with common 
characteristics.</p> 
<p>For example, to him, the term &ldquo;dog&rdquo; for example wasn&rsquo;t a 
generic term encompassing all sorts of sizes and varieties of dogs. It was the 
specific name of the specific dog we first pointed out to him as being a dog. 
All other dogs were different in some even minute detail from that dog, so they 
simply could not be dogs as well.</p> 
<p>Teaching him to group things based on &ldquo;our&rdquo; generalities was 
one of the toughest tasks we had as part of his speech therapy; and I would 
classify these concepts as being &ldquo;social constructs&rdquo; in language. 
Moreover, although they differ a little form language to language, the use of 
&ldquo;general&rdquo; nouns and group classifications seems to be a construct 
that is somewhat common to most of the main languages used around the globe. 
For example, although English speaking people use &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and Italian 
speakers use &ldquo;cane,&rdquo; both speakers are still working with a word 
that describes similar animals and that are descriptive of more than one 
specific dog or breed of dog.</p> 
<p>Once my son mastered that single concept, his language development 
literally took off. As a result, I find it perfectly believable that autistics 
may socially connect one on one with each other using attention to minute 
details that are important to them which NTs seldom notice.</p> </dd>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is a &ldquo;language&rdquo; but it may be a form 
of communication. Twins have been known to come up with their own 
&ldquo;language&rdquo; to communicate with one another. Does anyone remember 
that &ldquo;look&rdquo; Mom would give you if you were doing or saying 
something you shouldn&rsquo;t? Deaf individuals can tell if someone is 
comfortable with them by observing &ldquo;body language&rdquo; which is again, 
a form of communication. Some are more in tuned to such communication and some 
are not. We communicate through various means and perhaps those on the spectrum 
are doing the same thing. Just an opinion. Thank you for the article.</p> </dd>

<p>My grandson is three years old diagnosed as pdd. He and I often play by the 
over the top way I read to him. During those times he is fully with me. When I 
walk in the next time he will often look at me, grin and recite a particularly 
fun part of the book we last read. My daughter will immediately tell me not to 
encourage this behavior of repeating, yet I believe he is telling me he 
remembers that enjoyable contact and wants to do it again, not always with the 
same book. I feel like I am not communicating back when I ignore the invitation.
<br> I&rsquo;m not saying this is the sole form of communicating, but throwing 
him a few his way, like learning at least a few words in Italian, won&rsquo;t 
do harm and in fact seems to open more to focusing on what I am saying and how 
I am saying it to better understand my meaning. Language is give and take and 
getting that concept across seems to take some positive recognition for his 
attempts in order to eventually get him to move to the more common language 
spoken by the rest of us. Thoughts?</p> </dd>

<p>I too tend to agree with Alan. </p> 
<p>I suppose non-verbal people may have non-verbal communication but they can 
only communicate with people equipped to receive, at this end of the spectrum 
we are not so equipped.</p> </dd> </dl>  Leave a Comment Name<em>*</em> <br>
