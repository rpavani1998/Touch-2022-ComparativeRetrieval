<h1>Food Formulation No Longer Kid Stuff </h1> 
<h2>The old Victorian aphorism, &#147;Children should be seen and not 
heard,&#148; once was the guiding principle of food formulation. No longer.</h2>

<li>Childhood in Crisis</li> 
<p>A generation ago, formulating a food or beverage item for the 
elementary-school set meant sticking sugar in it, a cartoon character on it, 
then blitzing the TV cartoon hour with a flood of 120-decibel kid-beguiling 
ads. No more.</p> 
<p>While some manufacturers still try to play that game, the recognition of 
children's discerning palates and special nutritional needs is steering most 
processors toward more proactive thinking when it comes to feeding our young.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Many foods are made with the nutrition needs of adults in 
mind,&rdquo; says Tara DelloIacono-Thies, nutritionist and &ldquo;kid food 
coach&rdquo; for<strong>Clif Bar &amp; Co.</strong> (www.clifbar.com), 
Berkeley, Calif. &ldquo;This &lsquo;cookie-cutter&rsquo; approach of adults to 
kids doesn&rsquo;t always translate when it comes to making healthy foods that 
meet the needs of our children. Kids have different needs and requirements than 
adults.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<h6>Clif Bar &amp; Co. designs its line of Clif Kids organic products for 
&ldquo;kids in motion,&rdquo; using whole grains and sweeteners such as fig 
paste, brown rice syrup and tapioca syrup.</h6> <br>
<br>

<p>When formulating the nutritional profile for Clif Kid products, 
DelloIacono-Thies looks at what nutrients kids ages 6-12 usually are lacking, 
such as iron and zinc, and focuses on helping meet the RDA needs.</p> 
<p>Childhood represents a time of marked physical change and development, 
according to Ram Chaudhari, senior executive vice president and chief 
scientific officer for<strong>Fortitech Inc.</strong> (www.fortitech.com), 
Schenectady, N.Y. The company provides a variety of nutrient premixes targeting 
the health needs of children in formulated foods and beverages. &ldquo;Because 
of differing food patterns and high requirement for certain nutrients in 
children compared to adults, children are at greater risk of developing 
micronutrient deficiencies of key nutrients,&rdquo; he says.</p> 
<p>As Chaudhari explains, the focus of nutrition during childhood is to 
provide adequate nutrients to meet requirements for growth and activity. 
&ldquo;A well nourished child is not only healthier, but he or she is happier 
and performs better scholastically. It is now known that achieving optimal 
nutrient intakes during childhood also helps to reduce the risk of chronic 
diseases during adulthood, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular 
disease.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Sarah Staley, vice president of business development for Netherlands-based 
<strong>Friesland Foods Domo USA Inc.</strong> (www.domo.nl), concurs. 
&ldquo;Companies face a dilemma in making foods that are acceptable, tastewise, 
for young children and nutritionally acceptable to the parents. In the teen 
years you see much more awareness of the link between food, nutrition and 
health -- that age group can understand that food is about more than what 
tastes good. [But] younger children will not eat a product they do not like 
just because it is good for them.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>When formulating for elementary school children, processors need to be 
aware of the nutritional needs vital for growing bodies, what the common 
deficiencies are, the balance between healthy growth vs. unhealthy weight gain, 
what will give additional benefits to support developing brains and bodies. How 
do you make your product meet the parent&rsquo;s need for nutrition and the 
child&rsquo;s taste preference?</p> 
<p>Balancing the needs of the children, the interests of the parents and 
overall taste preferences presents the biggest challenges to processors. 
&ldquo;There are nutrient gaps [that] reveal a pattern of weakness in 
children&rsquo;s diets,&rdquo; says Chaudhari. &ldquo;The answer to this 
problem is not just to eat more food; there is a strong need to change the 
overall pattern of micronutrient intake in children. This may be achieved to 
some extent by encouraging the consumption of various nutrient-rich foods, such 
as fruits and vegetables. However, as many parents know from first-hand 
experience, this approach often meets with limited success.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The haphazard eating patterns of children often limit intake of 
certain key nutrients, causing worry for parents and possible less-than-optimal 
development for the child,&rdquo; Chaudhari adds. &ldquo;Increased availability 
of kid-targeted fortified food products could address this.&rdquo; Chaudhari 
points out that, besides the obvious and oft-focused upon bones, other organs 
also are developing and changing rapidly across childhood.</p> 
<p>To maximize bone development in children, many nutrients are needed, 
including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium &mdash; the key bone mineral 
components &mdash; and vitamin C, vitamin D and vitamin K for bone metabolism.
</p> 
<p>Dietary iron should be sufficient to combat anemia, a surprisingly common 
ailment in young children. Whereas symptoms of childhood anemia &mdash; 
fatigue, lethargy, irritability, pale color, weakness, headaches and cold 
intolerance &mdash; can apply to many of today&rsquo;s overworked kids, 
children exhibiting such symptoms for more than a day or kids who get 
infections on a frequent basis should be tested for anemia.</p> Page 1 of 3
