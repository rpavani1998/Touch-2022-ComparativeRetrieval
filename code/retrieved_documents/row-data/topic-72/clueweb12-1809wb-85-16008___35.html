<h2>AU Plan of Action on The Family</h2> <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<p><strong>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong><br>
1. The Constitutive Act of the 
African Union (AU) articulates the determination of Member States to promote 
peoples&rsquo; rights, consolidate democratic institutions and culture, and to 
ensure good governance and the rule of law. In addition, it resolves to take up 
the multifaceted challenges that confront the continent and peoples in light of 
the social, economic and political changes taking place in the world. 
Recognition that the family is the basic and most fundamental unit of society, 
a dynamic unit engaged in an intertwined process of individual and group 
development, justifies the need to place the African family at the core of 
society which needs to be strengthened as part of Africa&rsquo;s development 
process.<br>
2. As the core of the society, the Family can be seen in three 
dimensions: firstly, as a psycho-biological unit where members are linked 
together by blood ties &ndash; kinship relationship, personal feelings and 
emotional bonds of its members; secondly, as a social unit where members live 
together in the same household and share tasks and social functions; and 
thirdly as the basic economic production unit. It is, therefore, imperative to 
provide sustained support and encourage cohesion of the family to enable it 
play its role. In this regard, it is necessary to develop and implement social 
policies to address the various concerns of families.<br>
3. In Africa, the 
family is an equally important institution of society but it is undergoing 
tremendous changes and facing many formidable challenges thus increasing 
pressures on the family, including: increasing poverty, civil strives and 
conflicts; and vulnerability. Other constraints faced by the African family 
include: the debt burden, poor governance, high unemployment rate, inadequate 
social security mechanisms, rural to urban migration, gender inequality, 
displacement and disintegration of family. The intensifying impact of HIV/AIDS 
and other pandemics on the socio-economically productive sector of the 
population, especially young women, is putting unprecedented strain on the 
family. To effectively address these challenges, there is a need for an 
integrated approach that places the family at the centre of a comprehensive 
development agenda, aimed at sustaining the its integrity.<br>
4. Cognizant of 
the multidimensional challenges facing the family the world over, the United 
Nations and other regional and national agencies have tried to pay particular
<br>attention to family problems. A landmark in the UN&rsquo;s effort to 
address family concerns was the declaration of 1994 as the International Year 
of the Family (IYF). Pursuant to this was Resolution CM/Res 1466 (LVIII) of the 
then OAU, urging Member States to give priority to the preparation for and 
observance of the IYF and establish National<br>
Coordinating Committees or 
similar mechanisms for the Year. Although African governments have put in place 
institutions and programmes directed to the family, a lot<br>
still remains to 
be done.<br>
5. It is in this context that, in Decision EX/CL/65 (III), the 
Heads of State and Government, meeting at Maputo in July 2003, mandated 
&ldquo;the AU Commission, in collaboration with UNICEF and other social 
partners to elaborate a Plan of Action on the Family in Africa, which will 
constitute Africa&rsquo;s contribution to the Tenth Anniversary of the 
IYF&rdquo;.<br>
6. The main objective of the Plan of Action is to advocate for 
the promotion, formulation, implementation and monitoring of policies and 
programmes to ensure the<br>
protection of and support to the African family so 
as to enable it play its vial role more effectively in the development of 
Africa. The creation of appropriate structures,<br>
mechanisms and capacities 
for responding to the challenges facing the family are an integral part of the 
Plan of Action.<br>
7. A management information system (MIS) is proposed for 
continuous data collection, analysis, utilisation, dissemination, storage and 
retrieval of information on the<br>
status of the family at all levels. The New 
Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development (NEPAD) reaffirms that 
Africa&rsquo;s development begins with the quality of its human<br>
resources 
and in this context, the African family is the most important human resource.
<br>8. The Plan of Action focuses on nine priority areas: poverty alleviation; 
rights to social services - education, health and reproductive health; 
promoting environmental<br>
sustainability - environment, water and sanitation, 
adequate shelter and land ownership; rights, duties and responsibilities; 
rights of protection for the family; strengthening family relationships; 
control of major causes of morbidity and mortality; ensuring peace and 
security; and follow-up, evaluation and monitoring.<br>
9. Each priority area 
has an objective with corresponding activities to attain the goal. The Plan of 
Action will serve as a framework to guide Member States in<br>
developing or 
evaluating appropriate national strategies and programmes on the African family 
and does not replace or underplay the role of other ongoing initiatives such as 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers 
(PRSPs) and NEPAD. Rather, the Plan of action on the African Family reinforces 
the focus on the family and aims to create linkages between the activities 
proposed and existing<br>
initiatives as well as build upon gains already made.
<br>10. Partnerships among all concerned stakeholders are mandatory for the 
effective implementation, follow-up and monitoring of the Plan of Action on the 
Family in Africa.</p> <br>

particularly their own role but also the specific role of other household and 
community influentials.</p> 
<p>C. To elicit husband/male influential perspective on preparation women and 
families now make for birth, particularly their current role in 
preparations/support and potential roles; feasibility and acceptability of 
birth preparedness; and to understand motivations of men to participate in 
preparing for the birth and ensuring skilled attendance at delivery.</p> 
<p>D. To explore husband/male influential support and perceived consequences 
of TBA compared to care by a skilled attendant during and after delivery, and 
their perspective on the preferences of women now for birth attendant and birth 
location, and reasons why women do or do not use skilled care (barriers, 
motivators, willingness to change).</p> 
<p>E. &nbsp;To explore husbands/male influentials&rsquo; knowledge and 
perceptions of problems, complications, and emergencies in birth and early 
postpartum, when and where they should be cared for, and perceptions of 
emergency care providers.</p> 
<p><b><i>DO NOT READ OBJECTIVES OUT LOUD TO INTERVIEWEE!</i></b></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>S</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>: &nbsp;</b>This is part of a study to learn 
more about how we can help women be healthier in pregnancy and childbirth. I 
want to ask you questions about what men in your community think about this

discussion about where she&rsquo;s going to delivery the baby?</b></p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f yes: </i>Who&rsquo;s involved in the conversation? W ho 
initiates it? What is said? What are all the places for delivery women and 
their families consider?</p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f no: </i>Why not? Should they have this kind of discussion? 
Why/ why not? Who should initiate a conversation on this topic?</p> 
<p><b>2</b><b>. &nbsp;During a woman&rsquo;s pregancy, does her husband do 
anything to prepare for childbirth?</b></p> 
<p><i>I</i><i>f yes: </i>What? Arrange transport? Set aside money? Other? How

<p>Where do they usually assist deliveries &ndash; at their own homes or at 
women&rsquo;s homes? What are the best parts about delivering with a TBA? What 
do women not like about delivering with a TBA? Why do you think some women 
deliver with TBAs and others deliver by themselves or with family members?</p> 
<p><b>6</b><b>. &nbsp;What do staff at health facilities do to help women 
during delivery?</b></p> 
<p>How do they help a woman feel more comfortable? How do they treat the 
people who come with the woman to the health facility, like her family members 
or a TBA? Do they ask women and their families to purchase any items or pay any 
fees? What? How much does it cost? What happens if women and their families 
can&rsquo;t pay these fees? W hy do you think some women deliver at health 
facilities and others deliver their babies at home and/or with TBAs?</p>

<h2>Male involvement in reproductive health</h2> <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<h3>Adapted with thanks to Family Care International</h3> 
<p><strong>Role and responsibility of men:</strong> The signers of the ICPD 
Programme of Action agreed that it is important for men to take more 
responsibility for their sexual and reproductive behaviour and family life. 
Everyone is more aware than ever of the need to involve men in reproductive 
health programmes. Several NGOs are also conducting research to determine what 
men's reproductive health needs are, and to better understand their sexual, 
marital, parenting, and family decision-making roles.</p> Read more <br>

<h2>Birth registration</h2> <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>How many children on the African continent are without fathers in their 
lives?<br>
The answer is we simply do not know. A contributing factor to both 
low commitment and knowledge about African fatherhood is the low numbers of 
fathers who register their names on their children's birth certificates.&nbsp;
</p> Read more <br>
<br>

<h2>How fatherhood made us human</h2> <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>Research into the roots of our species suggests that stronger bonds between 
fathers and their children played a role in shaping society as we know it. Some 
anthropologists even suggest that current social trends could bring us closer 
to the good old days of hunter-gatherer fathering.</p> 
<p>Although most moms wish the man in the house would take more of a role in 
childraising, things could be worse. Males take on the job of parental care in 
only 5 percent of mammalian species, according to research cited in 
&quot;Fatherhood: Evolution and Parental Behavior.&quot;</p> Read more <br>

<p><strong>'Sometimes when we argue and I shout at my partner she is scared of

again - but I hit her again...', 'I get angry with her and I totally lose

<li> Dealing with miscarriage <br>

<p><strong>Miscarriages happen for a wide variety of reasons.</strong> About 
half are due to abnormalities in the fetus or the placenta, including 
chromosomal problems. Sometimes the egg attaches in the wrong place resulting 
in an early miscarriage. Recent studies have linked environmental pollution or 
excessive caffeine consumption to higher risks of miscarriage. So the short 
answer is that most times, miscarriage occurs totally outside of the control of 
the expectant mother. But both physically and emotionally, miscarriage means 
much more than the textbook definition. There are strong physical and emotional 
impacts to a couple who experience miscarriage.</p> Read more... </li>

<p>Could being a dad-to-be explain why I'm having such strange dreams? As a 
dad-to-be, your feelings of excitement, anticipation, anxiety, and worry may 
open a floodgate of dreams. Perhaps you've been dreaming about sleeping with 
someone besides your partner? This could mean that you're worried that 
pregnancy will damage your sex life. Or maybe you've been dreaming about your 
grandparents? Pending fatherhood can make you think about your family's roots. 
Your dreams might also reveal that you are feeling resentful and left out as 
all the attention centres around your partner and her growing bump. </p> Read

<li> Bonding with the new baby <br>

<p><strong>&nbsp;When your new baby makes its appearance, it can be a 
challenge for both mom and dad to connect with the new baby.</strong> Lack of 
sleep and the other demands of being a new parent can wear thin on both fathers 
and mothers... But mom tends to have a better opportunity to get close to the 
new baby simply because she usually spends more time at it. And yet dads often 
feel a significant need to get close to the new baby, but have a challenge 
getting there. So we asked some new dads and some of the experts about how best 
to help dads bond with their babies.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Fathers and smoking <br>

<p><strong>Parental smoking is a significant issue.</strong> In a study of 
smoking households in the Midlands, UK containing infants under three months

<li> How to share in your partner's pregnancy <br>

<p>Face your fear. If you feel a sense of unreality coupled with raw fear, 
you're only normal. Will you be a good dad? Will your baby be born with ten 
fingers and ten toes? Will labour go smoothly? Will you love your baby? You'd 
be odd if you weren't afraid. Our best solution for this natural by-product of 
humankind's greatest experience is to talk to your partner, your dad, your 
friends who are old hands at this parenting business. You can also find other 
dads-to-be in the same boat as you on our dad to dad bulletin board.</p> Read

<li> Dads and breastfeeding <br>

<p><strong>Breast is best!!!</strong> Before the baby is born, you may find 
that many expectant fathers state categorically that breast is best, and that 
they are fully in favour of their partner breastfeeding for as long as possible.

<li> Married fathers <br>

<p><strong>Is it impossible for a father to be a good one if he is not married 
to the mother of his child?</strong> No. But it is certainly much harder, and 
it is more difficult for a father to leave the kind of legacy for his children 
that he needs to. Keeping your marriage strong takes time and investment but 
the rewards are great.</p> Read more... </li>

especially fathers. Situations of family and relationship violence impact 
couples, but can be particularly harmful for children.</p> Read more... </li>

<p><strong>From the beginning, it&rsquo;s crucial that fathers nurture a

that of thinking of your daughter as delicate or fragile. Many dads I meet

<li> Making the most of visits with the kids <br>

<p><strong>Many divorced fathers are faced with the reality of visitation- an 
often negotiated, mediated and all too brief time they are able to spend with 
their children.</strong> In many cases, visitation is very limited, compared to 
the relationship dads used to be able to enjoy, so it's absolutely crucial that 
dads make this visitation time the best possible experience for their children 
and themselves. Here are a few ideas for making the most of your visitation:</p>

<li> Boxers or briefs? Facts about men's fertility <br>

<p><strong>Men's part in fertilization is quite amazing.</strong> About 200 
million sperm are mixed with semen to form ejaculate. In most men, 15 to 45 
million of these sperm are healthy enough to fertilize an egg, although only 
400 survive after a man ejaculates. Only 40 of those 400 reach the vicinity of 
the egg, surviving the toxic environment of the semen and the hostile 
environment of the vagina. After another process called capacitation (an 
explosion that allows the remaining sperm to drill a hole through the tough 
outer layer of the egg), only one lone sperm reaches the egg for fertilization 
and conception.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Myths surrounding children and divorce <br>

<p><strong>In the early 1970&rsquo;s, Judith Wallerstein, began to study the 
effects ofdivorce on children.</strong> She studied a group of 131 children and 
their families who were going through the divorce process over a period of 25 
years. In her book, The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: A 25 Year Landmark Study, 
published in 2000, we learn that children really aren&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;resilient&rdquo; and that divorce leaves children to struggle for a 
life-time with the residue of a decision their parents made.</p> Read more...

<li> How to adjust to life as a single father <br>

<p><strong>Is there a more challenging transition for a man than to become a 
new single dad with children at home?</strong> <br>
If there is, I can't 
imagine it. Whether you lose your spouse and the mother of your kids to death 
or because of a divorce and/or abandonment or your partner working away fro 
long periods at a time, adjusting to the new reality of things is a major and 
life changing task.I look after my two daughters, aged five and four, in 
Harare, Zimbabwe - a very challenging environment. There are many times I just 
don't enjoy it - it is a real hard job but this is more than compensated for in 
the love I receive from my daughters, the praise from their Mum who is working 
away about the job I am doing and the hugs, kisses and other feedback I get 
from my girls.</p> Read more... </li>

<p><strong>Every father and stepfather can make a huge difference in his 
daughter&rsquo;s life!</strong> A father is the first man his daughter knows.

<p>It is much easier to become a father than to be one. ~Kent Nerburn</p> 
<p>When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly

astonished at how much he had learned in seven years. ~Mark Twain</p>

<li> Five commandments for today's family man <br>

<p><strong>Two years ago, I was getting a little woozy as I stared at the 
proof pages of a magazine I was editing.</strong> It was 4am. I had phoned my 
wife five times that night, promising to come home soon with each call. I 
really did love the work I was doing, but not seeing my kids for the whole day 
left me feeling empty. The worst of the calls involved hearing my youngest 
wailing in the background as my then six-year-old got on the line to say,

<p><strong>If you're like most new or expectant dads, you're probably carrying

<li> Real dads play dolls <br>

<p><strong>Is playing with dolls manly? Of course it is!</strong> That&rsquo;s 
a question that occurs to many fathers and stepfathers of daughters. And most 
of us believe that real men don&rsquo;t play dolls. That belief is of little 
use once you have a stepdaughter or daughter. In fact, it may be a major 
barrier in the work of building a strong bond with her.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Blended families <br>

<p><strong>Stepfamilies, also known as blended families, are more of a norm 
now than ever.</strong> At least one-third of all children will be part of a 
stepfamily before they reach age 18. Children in blended families may at first 
resist the many changes they face. Fortunately, most blended families are able 
to work out their growing pains and live together successfully. Open 
communication, positive attitudes, mutual respect and plenty of love and 
patience all have an important place in creating a healthy blended family.</p>

<li> Children's expectations of you and your ex <br>

<p><strong>Marriage is a contract between adults, and when it ends, the matter 
is between the adults - not, repeat, not the kids!</strong> Yet, no parental 
action has a greater impact on children. Children love their parents and want 
to be with them. Even in times of great stress, parents have a responsibility 
to conduct their legal affairs in a manner that will protect their children 
from adult conflicts. Try to agree with your ex the following. Then discuss it 
with your child or children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dealing with anger - your own and your child's <br>

<p><strong>Divorce can bring out the worst in people.</strong> It can cause an 
exceptional parent to lose focus on what is best for his/her children, which in 
turn can cause the children to feel mistreated. It seems some parents 
can&rsquo;t divorce their bad feelings for an ex spouse from their feelings for 
their children. When those negative feelings bleed over into the relationship 
with children, the result is a fractured child/parent relationship.</p> Read

<li> It's you she wants in the delivery room <br>

<p><strong>Be there for her! (and for yourself)</strong> What is the role of 
the father who is present at the birth of his child? Is he a labor coach, 
advocate or partner? Is he a fifth wheel? A nuisance? A liability? In the 
twelve years that I have served birthing families in my community, I have heard 
many passionate opinions about the presence of fathers at birth. Over the years 
my own understanding of the role that fathers play in pregnancy and birth has 
developed to become much deeper and more complex as I have served different 
families, each with their own unique relationship, culture, expectations and 
beliefs.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Tell your kids you love them! <br>

<p><strong>Men are often tongue tied when asked to make their feelings open 
but &quot;I love you,&quot; are three words all children need to hear often 
from their Dad.</strong><br>
Do you want those words to have real meaning to 
your child? Do you want them to connect one heart to another? Do you want to 
use them to develop a level of intimacy between you that communicates your 
heartfelt affection for your children? If so, consider strengthening 'I love 
you' with the following suggestions.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Children's ways of love <br>

<p><strong>Individual children each have to be shown love in a way which is 
also very individual</strong>. For example, one daughter may receive love best 
when dad or mom gives her a very personalized gift&mdash;it could be a note, a 
set of gel pens or a t-shirt, but she knows she is loved when someone gives her 
something. Trying to use the technique that worked for one child with the other 
would be useless.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Listen to her - and then listen some more <br>

<p><strong>Girls tend to be a riddle to fathers.</strong> Like any mystery, 
the relationship with our daughter can be frightening, exciting, entertaining, 
baffling, enlightening or leave us completely in the dark; sometimes all at 
once...</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Healing family conflicts <br>

<p><strong>Families can be torn apart by illness, divorce or other problems 
that create conflict and stress.</strong> Family therapy can help families 
identify and resolve problems. Your family can be your greatest source of 
support, comfort and love. But it can also be your greatest source of pain and 
grief. A health crisis, mental illness, work problems or teenage rebellion may 
threaten to tear your family apart. Family therapy can help your family weather 
such storms. Family therapy can help patch strained relationships, teach new 
coping skills and improve how your family works together. Whether it's you, 
your partner, a child or even a sibling or parent who's in crisis, family 
therapy can help all of you communicate better and learn to get along.</p> Read

<p><strong>Fathers parent differently from mothers and that difference matters 
a lot for kids!</strong> Fatherhood is just as essential to healthy child 
development as motherhood! In some measures, father-love is more important. The 
professional journal, Review of General Psychology, finds &ldquo;evidence 
suggests that the influence of father love on offspring&rsquo;s development is 
as great as and occasionally greater than the influence of mother love.&rdquo;

denial or not paying attention!</strong> Remember that as difficult as it may 
be to watch your partner or loved one in pain, most fathers find the birth of 
their child to be one of life's most powerful and satisfying moments. Of 
course, it's better if know that you've been a help rather than a hindrance. To

<li> Non-violent relationships: A role for fathers <br>

<p><strong>Good fathers help their boys treat women with respect</strong> They 
lead by example by respecting their partners, wives, and the mothers of their 
children. Boys learn from their fathers to treat women with respect, not to use 
violence to get their way or solve their relationship problems. They let their 
daughters know that they must not accept abusive behaviour from men as the 
norm. They help their daughters to tell men that their father would never use 
abuse towards them, would not sanction their brothers or other relatives to do 
it so why should they accept it from any other man? Fathers play a critical 
role in providing their children with safe home environments that are free from 
abuse and neglect. All children deserve a chance to grow up unafraid.</p> Read

<p><strong>My wife had a baby a couple of weeks ago and, after the initial 
elation I am surprised to find myself feeling quite down.</strong> Can men get 
something like the baby blues as well as women? Yes, fathers are vulnerable to 
similar emotions to a new mother, and there's some evidence that new dads can 
become depressed after the birth of a baby as well. That's one of the reasons 
we know that the baby blues aren't exclusively caused by hormonal changes.</p>

<p><strong>Which is better for your kids? Should you stay together for the 
sake of the kids, or have a good divorce and set positive role models for your

who fare better in life as adults than unhappy couples who stay together for 
the sake of the kids. It is generally accepted that children learn both good 
and dysfunctional patterns and behavior from their parents.</p> Read more...

<p><strong>Illness, infidelity, sex, anger, communication problems, parenting

and heal wounds. Your partner comes home from work, makes a beeline for the

<p><strong>It is hard to imagine a more difficult transition for a child than 
to be a party to his or her parents' divorce.</strong> I have watched this 
closely the last few months as some very good friends of ours have been 
separated and preparing for divorce. And even through attempts at

<p><strong>One of the biggest challenges for fathers is selecting appropriate 
discipline for their children.</strong> <br>
Discipline is all about modifying

the best of you? As we discipline children, anger is an emotion that must be 
controlled. After all, we are trying to change behavior and teach self 
control--we can't lose ours in the process. Find ways to keep anger under
