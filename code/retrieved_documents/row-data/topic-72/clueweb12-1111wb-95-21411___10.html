<h3>Improve your Accent and Pronunciation Tempe, AZ</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Our latest language learning tip video teaches you <strong>how to improve 
your accent and pronunciation in a foreign language.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Beginners will not want to focus heavily on these techniques but should 
definitely be aware of them and be using them as they progress. You can also 
use these techniques to simply build speaking fluency. A large part of speaking 
fluency is recall and muscle memory. You may have the words but stumble when it 
is time to speak because you have not developed the muscle memory or habit.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Alphabet and Compound Sounds</strong> &ndash; Make sure that you 
know all of the alphabets individual and compound sounds so that you can say 
them without thinking. It needs to become second nature.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Go Slow </strong>- When you practice take your time and sound 
out each syllable. I know natives dont always pronounce each syllable but learn 
it correctly first and then you can adjust later. Your speaking abilities will 
sound more polished and natural. When you do start to drop syllables or to 
speak quickly like a native you will sounds even better.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Be a Copy Cat</strong> &ndash; I know that your mom told you 
that it isnt nice to be a copy cat but when learning a foreign language it 
pays. Pick a subject and study them. Imitate everything they say and how they 
say. Choose someone whos accent and pronunciation you enjoy and do your best to 
speak like them.</p>

<h3>Convenient Language Learning in Tempe, AZ</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p>

<p>Heres a language learning tip that is a personal favorite. Leave a comment 
or subscribe to our blog and let us know what you think or what has worked for 
you.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A brief synopsis of the video:</p> 
<p>Making language studies convenient and easy is very important. It is 
important for 2 reasons.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>When the going gets tough</strong> &ndash; When language 
learning becomes difficult or a chore students often give up or move on.<br>
 2.
<strong>Natural is better </strong>- Language learning is more natural when it 
is extemporaneous and in the moment.</p> 
<p>How to make language learning more convenient:</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Plan ahead</strong> &ndash; Make sure that you think ahead about 
how you can make your language studies more natural. For example if you are in 
the car and you have satellite radio tune into one of the foreign language 
stations. Watch the news in Spanish. Make daily activities that you would do 
normally into language learning opportunities.<br>
 2. <strong>Use Convenient 
Tools</strong> &ndash; Make sure that you have the tools necessary to help you 
make language learning convenient. A small notepad always at the ready. A very 
small pocket dictionary. Foreign language music or podcasts on your ipod.</p>

<h3>Essential Books for Language Study</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Most people who are studying foreign languages will have a whole library of 
books about their language of interest. However, there a few that you just cant 
do without. I show books for different languages but you can find the books I 
show in almost any language easily with the exception of my extremely small 
French only dictionary.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>List of Books:<br>
<strong><br>
 1. 501 verb books: </strong> When I was 
learning French I chose the 6 most common conjugations and learned the 
different verb types. Er, Ir, Oir.. I started by writing them hundreds of times 
each until I could recite them without thinking. Then I progressed to reciting 
them by memory. Next I created sentences and used all of the conjugations for 
each pronoun in each tense until is was second nature.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Standard Dictionary:</strong> Although there are lots of 
dictionaries out there very few do it well. Look for a dictionary with precise, 
up to date and adequate definitions. It also helps if they have examples of how 
the word is used contextually or idiomatically.<br>
<strong><br>
 3. Theme 
Based Dictionaries:</strong> I personally really like Mastering Language 
Vocabulary by Barrons but Im sure there are others that are very good. The 
books gives you a lot of vocabulary words that are important in certain 
subjects but you may have not have thought of because they are more idiomatic 
or technical words that are uncommon.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Uber Tiny Pocket Dictionary:</strong> I found this dictionary 
while living in France and fell in love. I literally carried it with me 
everywhere I went for 1.5 years. At anytime I wanted to find out what a word 
meant that someone said in a conversation or while reading I instantly looked 
it up. This dictionary is French only so I only started using it after I was 
conversational. However, it is the most important book in my collection because 
it makes language learning convenient and immediate. Often times youll think of 
a word and then forget it because by the time you get home and can look it up 
youve completely forgot.</p> 
<p>I hope this helps you get started learning your desired foreign language or 
improves your current studies.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg - StumbleUpon -

<h3>Kids vs Adults learning a foreign language</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Im not one who believes that people are limited. I dont think that we have 
supernatural powers but at the same time feel that what holds many back are our 
own minds. Fear, Doubt, Apprehension, Suspicion, Laziness and Preconceived 
notions about how something is. I think that language learning is the same way.
</p> 
<p>I often get asked by adult students if it is too late for them to learn a 
foreign language. My response is always that anyone can learn a foreign 
language. You may learn faster or slower than the next but if you work hard you 
will learn the language.</p> 
<p>Adults are no different than kids in our ability to learn except that we 
have this intellectual or emotional baggage that tells that we cant do 
something or that it is too difficult and not worth trying. Kids just do it 
because it is part of their life.</p> 
<p>Ive been thought about this for a long time and these are just some of my 
personal rantings about Kids vs Adults in language learning. Heres the blog 
post that reignited this subject for me.</p> 
<p>Im not sure that it is an easier for younger children to learn a foreign 
language but it does seem that the end result is a more fluid and natural 
speaker of the 2nd language. Adults can achieve the same results but it takes 
time and hard work. Work that kids just saw as part of life and occured 
naturally for them in their daily activities.</p> 
<p>I think that part of the reason that we think that kids learn easier is 
because they dont remember how hard it was because it was just part of life. Do 
you ever think about 2nd grade and say history, math or English class was hard? 
Probably not.</p> 
<p>As adults we build up language learning too much in our minds as something 
hard or think it will be easy and then get discouraged when we dont speak 
fluently in 30 days.</p> 
<p>It takes kids 7-8 years before they speak their native language extremely 
well. Even then they will be learning it for another 8-10 years depending on 
their education. Adults learning a foreign language think it is hard because 
they are more conscious of the effort they are exerting in order to gain this 
new skill and knowledge. Additionally, adults have become accustomed to 
learning new thing quickly with their increase intelligence and experience.</p> 
<p>Language has a humbling effect and probably takes the same amount of time 
to learn as an adult as it does as a child. So do I think that it is easier for 
kids to learn a foreign language than adults. NO! Adults are just more aware of 
all of the hard work it takes to learn a language.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg

<h3>My Favorite Language Learning Tool</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Should we start with a round of 20 questions or should I just tell you. 
Youd be surprised to know thats extremely simple.<strong>My favorite Language 
learning tool is Pen and Paper</strong>. No matter how much technology 
advances, for me, nothing replaces pen and paper.</p> 
<p><strong>So why pen and paper</strong>? Well its amazing versatile. It does 
whatever I need it to do and I dont have to go buy a specific program or have 
access to a computer to use it. Pen and paper also connects you with the words 
you are learning. Although making associations, no matter how wild as long as 
they make sense to you, are important you still need to be able to relate the 
words you are learning to say with their authentic visual form. Another reason 
why I love pen and paper is because they are extremely portable and quick. No 
PDA to turn on or dig out of my bag just pull out an index card or small 
notebook and a pen from my pocket, jot down a note and back to what I was doing.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>So what do I use pen and paper for</strong>? Well like I said 
before it can be used for whatever your personal language learning needs are. 
So dont limit yourself to my list but I will tell you mine as long as you 
promise not to limit yourself to my needs.</p> 
<p>- <strong>Learning new words</strong> &ndash; When Im out and about I am 
very observant. I look at every thing around and think of all of the items for 
which I dont know the name. For example Im out walking in the streets and I see 
a balcony and I dont know what it means. So I just write down balcony and I 
will look it up later.</p> 
<p>Another way I use this same technique is if I hear a new word and I dont 
know what it is. Ill either ask the person right then, what does X mean?, or 
Ill write it down and look it up later.</p> 
<p>- <strong>Remembering new words &ndash; </strong>When Im learning new words 
I try and use them as quickly as possible as long as its a useful word. 
Sometimes though it takes a couple of times of looking it up before it sticks 
so instead of hauling out the dictionary I write a brief definition of the word 
in my notebook and then I just quick reference it while Im in the act. That way 
its immediate and I can use it right away.</p> 
<p>- <strong>Make Believe</strong> &ndash; Although I hate workbooks that make 
you fill in the blank I love to write my own fake conversations or letters. 
Possibly even keeping a personal journal in your new foreign language. Warning: 
The first couple of months maybe complete gibberish until you start making 
progress but it will give you great experience in making real sentences as if 
you were having conversation. You can also look back on it and obviously see 
your progress.</p> 
<p>- <strong>Repetition</strong> &ndash; When I was learning French I was the 
slowest learner in my group. Although I eventually passed all of my 
contemporaries in ability it was not an easy thing. I have piles of paper where 
I have wrote and rewrote the different French conjugations until I had 
memorized all of them and they were like second nature. I no longer had to 
think about conjugating and I could actually become fluent in conversation. 
Fluency is different than accuracy and fluency is achieved when you no longer 
have to think about what you are saying just like a native. That doesnt mean 
you wont make mistakes ( thats accuracy ) but you will be able to hold 
extemporaneous conversations.<br>

language learning tool or has other favorites feel free to post them in the

<h3>Learn a Language with Native Materials</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Im sure that those of you who have been studying foreign languages for a 
little or long while have used a few if not dozens language books. Language 
dictionaries, lesson books, grammar books and other miscellaneous language 
products. Im also pretty sure that youve found your most effective language 
learning experiences have been when you are immersed in the language.</p> 
<p>So in an effort to feel like you are immersed in the language you should 
try and interact with native materials. They dont have to be grammar books or 
practice exercises you need to get authentic French, Spanish or Japanese 
magazines, music or books. Whatever you can get your hands ons. Try Amazon. 
Alright so why? Well one it makes sense and two I said so. OK so you arent 
convinced.</p> 
<p>Here are a few reasons you should be using primarily native materials 
supplemented by formal books to help refine your language skills.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Your brain is SMART</strong>: Consciously and Sub consciously 
your brain knows you arent dealing with the real thing and isnt going to 
respond as well to materials that are just fluff.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Natural Flow</strong>: All of these materials dont flow 
naturally the way real people would speak or write the language. If you are 
reading a formal English book you would look at it and think. No one speaks 
this way. So why would you do the same when learning a foreign language?</p> 
<p>3. <strong>You benefit</strong>: In the end it will be you who benefits. It 
may take you a little longer because the writing isnt dumbed down, but youll 
learn real sentence structure, patters and rhythm.</p> 
<p>So no matter what language you are learning do a simple search and try and 
find materials in your language of Interest. French, Spanish, German, Italian, 
Greek, Japanese, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Hebrew 
or English. It doesnt matter. Materials are available and probably a lot 
cheaper than your books you get from Borders.</p>

<h3>Teaching Kids a Foreign Language: A Parents Guide</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Let me first say that yes starting a childs language education as early as 
possible is always ideal and the most beneficial. However, parents need to be 
educated and realistic about the options, priorities and their expectations. 
Too many parents think that it suffices to enroll their children in a 2 month 
or twice a week language program that lasts 45 minutes a class and expect their 
children to magically become fluent. If this is you Im sorry to break your 
heart but its not going to happen. Unless you child istwo and should be in Mensa
 then you probably have severely unrealistic expectations.</p> 
<p>**Before I go any further let me share my list of most important To Dos for 
every parent.</p> 
<p>Be involved<br>
 Be Patient<br>
 Be Consistent<br>
 Be Proactive<br>
 Think 
Long term</p> 
<p>So lets first address some of the common knowledge about kids and learning 
a foreign language. Yes kids learn very effectively and it helps to start your 
children at a young age. Why? Before the age of 12-15 kids brains are still 
creating their network of neurons and that means that instead of installing a 
new language next to the original they are creating parallel paths in their 
brains that, to them, all mean the same thing and have no distinct difference. 
So basically they are native. Now this is also if the kids truly grow up in a 
bilingual situation. So there has to be a certain level of exposure and 
commitment to the childs language education.</p> 
<p>Now lets talk about how parents can accomplish this goal and how those 
without the means to do so can still give their kids a meaningful and effective 
language education.</p> 
<p>So here are the situations where kids can become naturally fluent in a 
foreign language. * there are always exceptions</p> 
<ol> 
<li>One or more parents is a native speaker and only speaks to the in their 
language</li> 
<li>Immersion school. The kids attend a foreign language only school where all 
subjects are taught in the target language.</li> 
<li>Nanny time. If the parents can afford a nanny who is a native speaker of 
the language the child may not be native but will definitely have the necessary 
exposure and will do very well.</li> </ol> 
<p>I know all of those options are very expensive. So for those families 
without the means or time to dedicate here are some alternative options that 
will still yield serious and positive results.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Private lessons. Though expensive they are less expensive than private 
school or a full time nanny. Kids will get one on one exposure to the language.
</li> 
<li>Play groups: Kids will get to learn the language the way they do best. 
Through play, imitation and subconscious learning.</li> 
<li>Parent Time: Parents can learn the foreign language and in turn teach 
their children.</li> 
<li> Bootstrapping: Do everything that you can that will expose your child to 
the language or culture.
<ol> 
<li>Attend cultural events</li> 
<li>Make friends that speak the language that have kids</li> 
<li>Watch movies or cartoons in the language</li> 
<li>Read them books in the language. Even &ldquo;See spot run&rdquo; is better 
than nothing.</li> 
<li>Call in a favor from that distant relative abroad and send your kid to 
visit for the summer.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> 
<p>No matter what your child can learn a foreign language. This is a simple 
article to educate and dispel some of the common myths about childhood language 
acquisition.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg - StumbleUpon - del.icio.us - Furl -

<h3>www.123teachme.com Review: Spanish Studying Resources</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Are you having a hard time finding Spanish study materials online? Well 
heres another potential resource for you.http://www.123teachme.com is an online 
Spanish resource and guide. 123 teach me has paid us to review their site in an 
unbiased manner and we will not offer anything less than our honest opinion. 
*see our about page for more details.</p> 
<p>123 Teach Me at first glance looks like a simple website, but seem to offer 
a good variety of language learning resources for their visitors. Heres a short 
list of the learning materials and tutorials they provide.</p> 
<p>Beginner Spanish<br>
 Conversational Spanish<br>
 Spanish for Kids<br>
 
Medical Spanish<br>
 Spanish Medical Dictionary<br>
 Technical Spanish Lessons
<br> Intermediate Spanish Lessons<br>
 Business Spanish</p> 
<p>123 Teach Me also provides a list of Spanish language schools in Spanish 
speaking countries that you can contact if you want to explore learning abroad. 
What is nice about this section of their website is that they dont mislead you 
into thinking they are the school and they dont seem to take a commission from 
the school which reduces your costs. It seems to me that the language schools 
simply pay them a subscription fee to be listed on their website. I think this 
is a great source for those looking for a language school. They even give 
details regarding each schools costs, website, amenities, living arrangements 
and specialties.</p> 
<p>I think that even though 123 Teach Me is not an amazing website and could 
use some more content it does offer some really good resources, learning 
materials and a solid language school directory for those considering learning 
Spanish abroad. So check out their website and then give me some feedback.</p>

<h3>Learning Japanese and French and Other Languages Through Music.</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Learning a foreign language through song is a great technique to improve 
your listening comprehension and speaking ability. Why you ask? Well from my 
own experience while living in France I sang often and everytime I learned 
something new about the language.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Slow it Down</strong>: Everyone loves a good slow jam. Singing, 
especially when you have the lyrics to read, helps you by slowing down the 
speed and allowing you to really hear the words. Normally when listening to 
native speakers they speak too fast for many beginners to truely pick up the 
little nuances in their pronuciation and accent. This is really just a 
different take on the same principle Ive mentioned before about listening and 
mimicing.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Youre so Dramatic</strong>: Normally being a drama queen isnt 
appreciated by most but in this situation a little exaggeration goes a long 
way. Singing allows you to exaggerate your words, pronunciation and accent, 
without looking like a complete weirdo. Exaggeration allows you to become 
familar with the often difficult sounds of a foreign language. As you master 
and gain control over the sounds you will naturally begin to sound more and 
more like a native speaker. So sing in your car, in a choir or in the shower 
but make sure you exaggerate.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>By</strong> <strong>Association</strong>: One of my favorite 
exercises is to read out loud. Reading out loud allows you to associate the 
words you normally hear spoken with the a visual image. Also, you get to, 
again, practice you speaking ability. You are multi-tasking. Singing is another 
form of reading out loud and allows you to see the words that you normally only 
hear. Also, because songs are stories you will learn new words and the song 
will help you to commit them to memory and understand their meaning based on 
context.</p> 
<p>Here are some examples and resources for succesful Sing Study. That has a 
nice ring to it. If anyone asks its mine and Ive copyrighted the term. : )</p> 
<p>Jeremy writes about learning Japanese by singing. This is a great way to 
learn to speak a foreign language.</p> 
<p>Dr. Prevots has posted a useful archive lyrics to many French songs on his 
website.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg - StumbleUpon - del.icio.us - Furl -
