<p><strong>Is there a more challenging transition for a man than to become a 
new single dad with children at home?</strong> <br>
If there is, I can't 
imagine it. Whether you lose your spouse and the mother of your kids to death 
or because of a divorce and/or abandonment or your partner working away fro 
long periods at a time, adjusting to the new reality of things is a major and 
life changing task.I look after my two daughters, aged five and four, in 
Harare, Zimbabwe - a very challenging environment. There are many times I just 
don't enjoy it - it is a real hard job but this is more than compensated for in 
the love I receive from my daughters, the praise from their Mum who is working 
away about the job I am doing and the hugs, kisses and other feedback I get 
from my girls.</p> 
<p>Most newly single dads I know struggle to know where to start. What should 
be first on my list, and how do I even begin tor get my arms around the rest? 
Having talked to a number of single dads who have successfully negotiated this 
transition with their children, let me offer the following recommendations.</p> 
<p><strong>Helping the Kids</strong></p> 
<p>As adults, we have at least learned some coping mechanisms in our life to 
deal with change.Often, our children are totally unprepared for having a single 
dad as their primary caregiver. So as you help your children adjust, consider 
the following suggestions.</p> 
<p><strong>Talk a lot.</strong> Many children will open up and want to talk to 
dad or others about what has happened. Others will clam up or get busy being 
supportive to suppress their feelings. Your job is to keep them talking and to 
be a good listener. Encourage them to talk with you&mdash;if not with you, 
create a situation where they can talk to a trusted adult. Sometimes relatives, 
clergy, adult friends or therapists can help if they won't talk with you. But 
it is important to help them deal with their feelings and frustrations. Of 
particular importance is helping them see that the loss of their mother is not 
their fault.</p> 
<p><strong>Show confidence.</strong> Children need to see that their dad is 
confident and optimistic about the future. Let them know that you are OK and 
that with time, your family will reach a new level of comfort and routine. Your 
attitude will make a huge difference in how they feel and cope now and later.
</p> 
<p><strong>Make and keep promises.</strong> For whatever reason their mom is 
no longer at home, your children's trust is likely shaken. Whether mom betrayed 
them by leaving or whether she died, they will not be very trusting, and, in 
their mind, for good reason. The best way to build trust with the children is 
to make and keep promises. Do what you say you will do, and don't make a 
promise you are not committed to keep. Consistency and honesty will help them 
find the courage to trust again.</p> 
<p>Losing a spouse for whatever reason can create all kinds of feelings in a 
man. And while you now in a very real sense have to be the principle support 
for the kids, you can't be all they need without a little self care.</p> 
<p><strong>Make time for introspection. </strong> You will find a need to take 
a deep look inside and be ready for this new challenge. Get a grip on your 
feelings. Writing them down in a journal or in a password-protected computer 
file can really be a good way of looking objectively. Consider your strengths 
and weaknesses and find ways to compensate for the things you have a hard time 
with. Get comfortable with yourself and it will go a long way to your healing 
efforts for yourself and your family.</p> 
<p><strong>Focus on health.</strong> Some dads deal with the stress of this 
situation by holing up or binge eating. Make sure you don't go there. Make time 
for exercise, even if you have to do it with one or more of the kids. Walk, 
run, hit the gym&mdash;just stay active. And make sure that you eat right. 
Resist the temptation to subsist on junk food. Keep lots of vegetables in your 
life.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider early mornings. </strong> Once the kids are up and around, 
its harder to make time for you. And at night, there are lots of temptations 
like TV and the computer to distract you. Get up an hour earlier than the kids 
and make time for exercise, reading, getting organized and maybe even some 
meditation. Investing one early morning hour in yourself can make a marked 
difference.</p> 
<p>One of the biggest challenges newly single dads tell me about is the need 
to establish new routines when the other adult at home is not there any more.
</p> 
<p><strong>Get the kids involved. </strong> A lot of routine chores are within 
the capability of the children. Chores like cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming and 
more are not beyond their skill level if you teach them what you expect. Achore 
chart can really help with reminding them and keeping them accountable.</p> 
<p><strong>Have laundry days. </strong> Trying to get ahead of and keep up 
with the laundry can be a big task. One new single dad I know tossed all of the 
kids' socks and bought 12 matching pairs for each child so mating socks became 
easy. Consider setting aside a couple of days a week for laundry. If your kids 
are a little older, they can do their own with a little training. And if you 
are not used to separating clothes for washing, ask an experienced laundry-doer 
for some help. There are not many things more discouraging than having a nice 
white shirt being suddenly pink because it was washed in the wrong temperature 
water with the wrong colors.</p> 
<p><strong>Have your own chore chart.</strong> One dad I know got one of those 
little binders that hold punched 3 x 5 index cards with dividers for different 
days of the week. Under the Monday and Thursday tabs, he put cards for 
vacuuming; under the Saturday tab was a card for cleaning the bathroom. Every 
day he opened the binder to the right tab and knew what he had to get done that 
day. Find a simple system and stick to it. It will take a lot of the stress out 
of these routine duties.</p> 
<p><strong>Accept help.</strong> Often, as others you love see you struggle, 
they will ask if they can help. Learn to be a gracious receiver of their 
offers. Swallow your pride, recognize that you can't do it all, and express 
gratitude for the help of others.</p> 
<p>With a little thought, time, emotional strength and help, you can make this 
very difficult transition to single fatherhood a little more bearable - and if 
you've advice for me dude, I would welcome it!</p>

<p><strong>Whether you are divorced or separated and the custodial parent, or

<p><strong>Two years ago, I was getting a little woozy as I stared at the

wife five times that night, promising to come home soon with each call. I

<p><strong>My wife had a baby a couple of weeks ago and, after the initial 
elation I am surprised to find myself feeling quite down.</strong> Can men get 
something like the baby blues as well as women? Yes, fathers are vulnerable to 
similar emotions to a new mother, and there's some evidence that new dads can 
become depressed after the birth of a baby as well. That's one of the reasons 
we know that the baby blues aren't exclusively caused by hormonal changes.</p>

<li> Dealing with miscarriage <br>

<p><strong>Miscarriages happen for a wide variety of reasons.</strong> About 
half are due to abnormalities in the fetus or the placenta, including 
chromosomal problems. Sometimes the egg attaches in the wrong place resulting 
in an early miscarriage. Recent studies have linked environmental pollution or 
excessive caffeine consumption to higher risks of miscarriage. So the short 
answer is that most times, miscarriage occurs totally outside of the control of 
the expectant mother. But both physically and emotionally, miscarriage means 
much more than the textbook definition. There are strong physical and emotional 
impacts to a couple who experience miscarriage.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Non-violent relationships: A role for fathers <br>

<p><strong>Good fathers help their boys treat women with respect</strong> They 
lead by example by respecting their partners, wives, and the mothers of their 
children. Boys learn from their fathers to treat women with respect, not to use 
violence to get their way or solve their relationship problems. They let their 
daughters know that they must not accept abusive behaviour from men as the 
norm. They help their daughters to tell men that their father would never use 
abuse towards them, would not sanction their brothers or other relatives to do 
it so why should they accept it from any other man? Fathers play a critical 
role in providing their children with safe home environments that are free from 
abuse and neglect. All children deserve a chance to grow up unafraid.</p> Read

<li> Do you have to be at your baby's birth? <br>

<p><strong>&nbsp;It's up to you!</strong> Two decades ago it was unusual for a

<li> Bonding with the new baby <br>

<p><strong>&nbsp;When your new baby makes its appearance, it can be a 
challenge for both mom and dad to connect with the new baby.</strong> Lack of 
sleep and the other demands of being a new parent can wear thin on both fathers 
and mothers... But mom tends to have a better opportunity to get close to the 
new baby simply because she usually spends more time at it. And yet dads often 
feel a significant need to get close to the new baby, but have a challenge 
getting there. So we asked some new dads and some of the experts about how best 
to help dads bond with their babies.</p> Read more... </li>

<p><strong>Fathers parent differently from mothers and that difference matters

development as motherhood! In some measures, father-love is more important. The

suggests that the influence of father love on offspring&rsquo;s development is 
as great as and occasionally greater than the influence of mother love.&rdquo;

<li> Myths surrounding children and divorce <br>

<p><strong>In the early 1970&rsquo;s, Judith Wallerstein, began to study the 
effects ofdivorce on children.</strong> She studied a group of 131 children and 
their families who were going through the divorce process over a period of 25 
years. In her book, The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: A 25 Year Landmark Study, 
published in 2000, we learn that children really aren&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;resilient&rdquo; and that divorce leaves children to struggle for a 
life-time with the residue of a decision their parents made.</p> Read more...

<li> Dealing with anger - your own and your child's <br>

<p><strong>Divorce can bring out the worst in people.</strong> It can cause an 
exceptional parent to lose focus on what is best for his/her children, which in 
turn can cause the children to feel mistreated. It seems some parents 
can&rsquo;t divorce their bad feelings for an ex spouse from their feelings for 
their children. When those negative feelings bleed over into the relationship 
with children, the result is a fractured child/parent relationship.</p> Read

<li> Disciplining for Dads <br>

<p><strong>One of the biggest challenges for fathers is selecting appropriate 
discipline for their children.</strong> <br>
Discipline is all about modifying 
behavior, not about anger or retaliation. Ever felt that your anger was getting 
the best of you? As we discipline children, anger is an emotion that must be 
controlled. After all, we are trying to change behavior and teach self 
control--we can't lose ours in the process. Find ways to keep anger under 
control as you work with your children.</p> Read more... </li>

pregnancy will damage your sex life. Or maybe you've been dreaming about your 
grandparents? Pending fatherhood can make you think about your family's roots.

cooking, cleaning, getting from A to B, money etc. There are times when too 
much stress makes life really difficult as everything seems too huge and too 
hard.</p> Read more... </li>

<li> Dad's at a distance - working away <br>

<p><strong>Relationships with children are much like plants, they need 
constant nourishing!</strong> At home, this type of nourishment comes easily 
through the activities and time spent with your children. However, when you are 
away this becomes more difficult to accomplish. If work takes you away from 
your child more often than you would like, these fun ideas will help you and 
her to have some special times, even though you're miles apart.</p> Read more...

<li> Healing family conflicts <br>

<p><strong>Families can be torn apart by illness, divorce or other problems 
that create conflict and stress.</strong> Family therapy can help families 
identify and resolve problems. Your family can be your greatest source of 
support, comfort and love. But it can also be your greatest source of pain and 
grief. A health crisis, mental illness, work problems or teenage rebellion may 
threaten to tear your family apart. Family therapy can help your family weather 
such storms. Family therapy can help patch strained relationships, teach new 
coping skills and improve how your family works together. Whether it's you, 
your partner, a child or even a sibling or parent who's in crisis, family 
therapy can help all of you communicate better and learn to get along.</p> Read

<li> Managing your anger <br>

<p><strong>Ever felt that your anger was getting the best of you?</strong> As 
we discipline children, anger is an emotion that must be controlled. After all, 
we are trying to change behaviour and teach self control--we can't lose ours in 
the process. Find ways to keep anger under control as you work with your 
children.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Prevention of HIV transmission to Infants <br>

<p><strong>Many people know nothing or very little about the Mother To Child 
Treatment programmes that can prevent babies contracting HIV.</strong> Men are 
even more marginalized and are not in a position to support their spouses, 
partners, and sisters in participating in the programmes.Counselling is a major 
factor affecting women and their partners' choices regarding voluntary HIV 
testing and subsequent participation in the programmes.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Married fathers <br>

<p><strong>Is it impossible for a father to be a good one if he is not married 
to the mother of his child?</strong> No. But it is certainly much harder, and 
it is more difficult for a father to leave the kind of legacy for his children 
that he needs to. Keeping your marriage strong takes time and investment but 
the rewards are great.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Infidelity: Mending your marriage after an affair <br>

<p><strong>Infidelity causes intense emotional pain &mdash; anger, disbelief, 
fear, guilt, shame.</strong> But an affair doesn't have to mean the end of your 
marriage. Understand how a marriage can be rebuilt after an affair. When an 
affair is first discovered, both partners feel as if the world has collapsed 
&mdash; you're left wondering whether your marriage can survive.</p> Read

<li> How to adjust to life as a single father <br>

<p><strong>Is there a more challenging transition for a man than to become a 
new single dad with children at home?</strong> <br>
If there is, I can't 
imagine it. Whether you lose your spouse and the mother of your kids to death 
or because of a divorce and/or abandonment or your partner working away fro 
long periods at a time, adjusting to the new reality of things is a major and 
life changing task.I look after my two daughters, aged five and four, in 
Harare, Zimbabwe - a very challenging environment. There are many times I just 
don't enjoy it - it is a real hard job but this is more than compensated for in 
the love I receive from my daughters, the praise from their Mum who is working 
away about the job I am doing and the hugs, kisses and other feedback I get 
from my girls.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Dads and breastfeeding <br>

<p><strong>Breast is best!!!</strong> Before the baby is born, you may find 
that many expectant fathers state categorically that breast is best, and that 
they are fully in favour of their partner breastfeeding for as long as possible.
<br>And, when you consider the benefits, why not?</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Single, separated and divorced fathers <br>

<p><strong>A peaceful divorce? Possibly. A pain-free divorce? That&rsquo;s 
exceedingly rare.</strong> The adjustments for dad, mum and kids are major. 
William Klatte has written an insightful book called<em>Live-Away Dads</em>. In 
it, he suggests five beneficial actions you can take: goals you can focus on 
when you don&rsquo;t know what to do next.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Boxers or briefs? Facts about men's fertility <br>

<p><strong>Men's part in fertilization is quite amazing.</strong> About 200 
million sperm are mixed with semen to form ejaculate. In most men, 15 to 45 
million of these sperm are healthy enough to fertilize an egg, although only 
400 survive after a man ejaculates. Only 40 of those 400 reach the vicinity of 
the egg, surviving the toxic environment of the semen and the hostile 
environment of the vagina. After another process called capacitation (an 
explosion that allows the remaining sperm to drill a hole through the tough 
outer layer of the egg), only one lone sperm reaches the egg for fertilization 
and conception.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Quick discipline strategies <br>

<p><strong>A good laugh helps break the tension.</strong> Instead of backing 
the child into a corner, you let him know that Hey, this is nothing serious. 
I'm in control so you are safe. We can work this out. I love you.</p> Read

<li> The effects of divorce on children and how to cope <br>

<p><strong>It is hard to imagine a more difficult transition for a child than 
to be a party to his or her parents' divorce.</strong> I have watched this 
closely the last few months as some very good friends of ours have been 
separated and preparing for divorce. And even through attempts at 
reconciliation through family counseling, the children have suffered. There 
have been many empirical studies focusing on the effects of divorce on 
children. Some of the common findings among all of these studies are detailed 
in this article.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Five worries about fathering our daughters <br>

<p><strong>Every father faces psychological and cultural barriers on the way 
to full engagement in a daughter&rsquo;s life...</strong> We must understand 
these hurdles to be effective fathers and stepfathers&mdash;or to work 
effectively with fathers and families. These hurdles may seem silly, 
unnecessary, or insignificant to others. But they are not silly, unnecessary, 
or insignificant to fathers.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> How to be more involved with your baby <br>

<p><strong>As a proud new dad, you want to do everything you can to be 
involved in your child's life.</strong> But during those bleary early weeks, 
when your baby is breastfeeding around the clock, it can be hard to work out 
where to start.Hang on in there. With time, you and your baby will develop your 
own special relationship - one that's just as vital as the mother-baby bond. 
Meanwhile, here are our top tips for being the best possible dad from the word 
go:</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Children's ways of love <br>

<p><strong>Individual children each have to be shown love in a way which is 
also very individual</strong>. For example, one daughter may receive love best 
when dad or mom gives her a very personalized gift&mdash;it could be a note, a 
set of gel pens or a t-shirt, but she knows she is loved when someone gives her 
something. Trying to use the technique that worked for one child with the other 
would be useless.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Making the most of visits with the kids <br>

<p><strong>Many divorced fathers are faced with the reality of visitation- an 
often negotiated, mediated and all too brief time they are able to spend with 
their children.</strong> In many cases, visitation is very limited, compared to 
the relationship dads used to be able to enjoy, so it's absolutely crucial that 
dads make this visitation time the best possible experience for their children 
and themselves. Here are a few ideas for making the most of your visitation:</p>

<li> Will I ever sleep again? <br>

<p><strong>If you are like almost every other new father you are not alone!
</strong> It's a fair question to ask especially after you've been up trying to 
soothe your screaming newborn!!! I have good news. The screaming and crying 
will eventually subside and yes, you will eventually get some well deserved 
rest. But, it may be a while. So here are a few tips to help you make it 
through those (short) nights.</p> Read more... </li> 
<li> Daughters and single dads <br>

<p><strong>Whether you are divorced or separated and the custodial parent, or 
whether you are a widowed dad, the challenges of raising daughters are 
similar...</strong> So, given the advice from those who have walked in your 
shoes, here are some suggestions for tackling this important task successfully.

<li> It's you she wants in the delivery room <br>

<p><strong>Be there for her! (and for yourself)</strong> What is the role of 
the father who is present at the birth of his child? Is he a labor coach, 
advocate or partner? Is he a fifth wheel? A nuisance? A liability? In the 
twelve years that I have served birthing families in my community, I have heard 
many passionate opinions about the presence of fathers at birth. Over the years 
my own understanding of the role that fathers play in pregnancy and birth has 
developed to become much deeper and more complex as I have served different 
families, each with their own unique relationship, culture, expectations and 
beliefs.</p> Read more... </li> </ul> <br>
