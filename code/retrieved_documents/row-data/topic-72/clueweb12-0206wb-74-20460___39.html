<p><b>Land use plan revived; may go </b></p> 
<p><b>to county July 6 </b> </p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>The ball is rolling, again.</p> 
<p>After a brief pause, Archuleta County's plan to pursue the revision of 
current land use regulations and the development of new policies is moving once 
more.</p> 
<p>And the general direction seems to be forward, according to the majority of 
sentiments expressed at the end of a Monday night workshop designed to get 
everyone involved up to speed.</p> 
<p>As a result, at its meeting last night (which occurred after press time) 
the Upper San Juan Regional Planning Commission was scheduled to &quot;ratify 
through written findings&quot; its May 26 recommendation to the county 
commissioners.</p> 
<p>The recommendation concerns changes to a draft bulk-mailing survey designed 
to gather public input on aspects included in a proposed land-use code that has 
often been referred to as the &quot;preferred alternative.&quot;</p> 
<p>Revisiting last month's decision by the planning commission satisfies a 
request made last week by Bill Steele, county administrator, suggesting the 
basis for the recommendation be clearly expressed in written &quot;minority and 
majority reports.&quot;</p> 
<p>Pending the outcome of the planning commission's meeting, further 
consideration of the survey is slated for the July 6 county commissioners' 
agenda.</p> 
<p>Monday's session, however, was designed for informational purposes, to 
reexamine the methodology involved in the 10-month planning process leading up 
to the current phase of development - plans given majority approval by the 
county commissioners and the planning commission whenever called into question.
</p> 
<p>The workshop was attended by representatives of the planning commission, 
county commissioners, administration, planning department staff and about a 
dozen members of the public.</p> 
<p>Presenting the research involved were members off the Citizens Task Force, 
the eight-member committee charged with evaluating new options for county 
land-use alternatives based on information compiled by county planning staff 
during a series of related focus groups conducted last fall.</p> 
<p>Reading aloud from a prepared report, task force member Lynda Van Patter 
summarized the background of the process and the committee's subsequent 
findings.</p> 
<p>After being appointed by the county commissioners Jan. 20, the task force 
began meeting with Marcus Baker, associate county planner, on a weekly basis 
after an initial session Feb. 12 &quot;to explore ways of implementing the 
Community Plan's land-use regulations,&quot; said Van Patter.</p> 
<p>The Community Plan, a conceptual guideline for the development of 
growth-management policies, was adopted by the county in 2001.</p> 
<p>As well as related areas of concern, said Van Patter, &quot;We looked at 
the number-one concern of Archuleta County citizens, which is 'responsible 
management of growth.'&quot;</p> 
<p>Furthermore, &quot;We reviewed several zoning and districting options 
during that time,&quot; said Van Patter, indicating the meetings &quot;explored 
and evaluated alternative scenarios&quot; that would meet the vision of the 
Community Plan &quot;in a politically and socially acceptable code that is 
administratively feasible.&quot; </p> 
<p>Among other aspects, said Van Patter, the review included traditional 
zoning, performance-based zoning and urban and rural districts, as well as 
public meetings in Chromo and Arboles.</p> 
<p>The end result was the recommendation of a &quot;preferred 
alternative,&quot; a performance-based code modeled loosely on an award-winning 
growth policy implemented in Fremont County, Idaho.</p> 
<p>According to statistics provided by Baker, the demographics of Fremont 
County are comparable to those of Archuleta County, indicating a population of 
about 12,000 and one incorporated town of 3,300.</p> 
<p>In addition, roughly 32 percent of the land in Fremont County is privately 
owned and the local economy is based primarily on tourism, recreation and 
agriculture.</p> 
<p>The Fremont County development policy addresses the environmental, cultural 
and visual impacts of growth and includes identification of commercial and 
industrial hubs, a transfer of development rights option and elements related 
to traditional zoning plans.</p> 
<p>Also included is the concept of planning districts and &quot;overlay 
zones,&quot; areas that take scenic and wildlife corridors, floodplains, etc. 
into special consideration without completely restricting development.</p> 
<p>Other key factors in the policy are &quot;suitability analysis&quot; and 
the notion that &quot;density is not specified by zones or districts, but 
rather calculated on environmental sensitivity of the land.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another significant factor in the Fremont code is the review process, which 
evaluates development proposals according to a &quot;scoring system&quot; 
comprised of three major components: &quot;absolute standards,&quot; 
&quot;relative, standards&quot; and &quot;importance factors.&quot;</p> 
<p>In summary, the code proposes planning for development based on impact as 
opposed to planning based strictly on land use.</p> 
<p>However, &quot;This recommendation intends the pursuing of the development 
of the code,&quot; said Van Patter, &quot;not the adoption of the code.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Further discussion of the Fremont County code led to several debates that 
garnered a wide range of commentary, both for and against a performance-based 
system.</p> 
<p>Some said such a code allows the proper amount of flexibility, others said 
it allows too much flexibility/mitigation and is arbitrary.</p> 
<p>One suggestion that received mainly favorable feedback was the possibility 
of sending members of planning staff and the planning commission to Idaho to 
gain a firsthand account of the pros and cons of the Fremont County system. </p>
<p>Offering a legal perspective, &quot;Performance-based zoning is a great 
deal more subjective,&quot; said Jeff Robbins, county attorney.</p> 
<p>&quot;But it is more flexible, there is no doubt about it,&quot; said 
Robbins, indicating such codes are usually easier to adopt but often more 
difficult to apply.</p> 
<p>Addressing assertions the proposed code is arbitrary, &quot;We're talking 
about an 'arbitrary code' that doesn't exist,&quot; said Baker. &quot;We don't 
have a black mark yet, because we haven't written it yet.&quot;</p> 
<p>A subsequent presentation by Ron Chacey concerning the practice of 
transferring development rights - which Chacey explained is basically a 
voluntary program that provides funding for the preservation of open space - 
sparked further questions.</p> 
<p>In short, some attendees wondered aloud if a wide range of opinions on 
potential policies will continue to be evaluated or if decisions on code 
details will be left to the task force.</p> 
<p>&quot;This committee is not going to be deciding any of these 
details,&quot; responded Chacey.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're all but done,&quot; he added, indicating the responsibility for 
such decisions ultimately falls into the hands of the planning commission and 
county commissioners.</p> 
<p>Finally, &quot;How do we do something?&quot; asked Planning Commissioner 
Jerry Jackson near meeting's end.</p> 
<p>&quot;This meeting tonight is because we're backing up,&quot; said Jackson, 
indicating he feels it is time decide what comes next. &quot;Let's get down to 
some of that.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I think we should have a survey and I think we should find out what 
the public thinks,&quot; responded Commissioner Alden Ecker.</p> 
<p>Similar opinions followed; for example, after indicating he feels the 
process may still &quot;sink of it's own weight,&quot; Planning Commissioner 
Bob Huff expressed a willingness to proceed.</p> 
<p>&quot;Whatever the majority is going to do, I'm for it,&quot; concluded 
Huff.</p> 
<p>A final suggestion from Robbins to &quot;dumb down the survey&quot; in 
order to improve understanding received mixed reviews.</p> 
<p>Some on hand said they feel making the survey easier to comprehend might 
reduce the time involved to fill it out, thereby encouraging greater public 
participation.</p> 
<p>Others, including Baker, argued making the survey too basic could defeat 
the purpose because &quot;the answers to the survey are going into the 
development code.&quot;</p> 
<p>The survey is most likely not in final form, said Baker.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, despite potential changes, any questions involved will be 
important, &quot;tough questions,&quot; concluded Baker.</p> 
<p>&quot;They require some thought.&quot; </p>

<p><b>3 Pagosans hurt, Michigan man killed in accidents</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A Michigan man was killed and two Pagosa Springs men were seriously injured 
in two separate accidents Saturday.</p> 
<p>According to Colorado State Patrol reports, Jacob Egg, 25, Matthew Hunt, 
21, and Isaiah Lucero, 21, all of Pagosa Springs, were ejected from a pickup 
truck in a one-vehicle accident on U.S. 84 near mile marker 26. None of the men 
were wearing seat belts.</p> 
<p>Trooper Brian Vining, the first state officer on the scene, said the Dodge 
Ram pickup was traveling at 86 miles per hour when the wheels went off the side 
of the road. It spun a quarter turn, crossed the highway and went off the other 
side of the highway. The truck then spun clockwise, went through a fence and 
rolled at least one time before coming to rest on its wheels. The accident 
occurred about 1 a.m. Saturday.</p> 
<p>Egg, the driver, was airlifted to St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe where 
he remained in serious condition in the intensive care unit Wednesday morning. 
Lucero was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. 
As of Wednesday morning, he was listed in stable condition in the neurological 
intensive care unit. Hunt was transported to Mercy Medical Center in Durango 
where he was listed in good condition Wednesday.</p> 
<p>According to state patrol reports, Egg was cited for vehicular assault and 
driving under the influence. </p> 
<p>Five hours later, Douglas Strickland, 42, of Jackson, Mich., was killed in 
another single-vehicle rollover. That accident occurred on U.S. 160 near Fosset 
Gulch Road.</p> 
<p>According to Colorado State Patrol reports, Strickland was eastbound on 
U.S. 160 about 6 a.m. when the 2005 rented Dodge minivan he was driving went 
off the road. The minivan came back on the road briefly before rolling multiple 
times for 266 feet, traveling over a cement culvert wall, through a creek and a 
fence before coming to rest on its top.</p> 
<p>Strickland was wearing a seat belt and airbags did deploy. He was 
pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p><b>PAWS OKs water rights resolution </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Of horses and hotels.</p> 
<p>Such was the theme for a portion of the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation 
District board of directors meeting Tuesday in which the board approved a 
resolution regarding water rights dedication for new or expanded uses within 
the district.</p> 
<p>Specifically, the resolution aims to &quot;assure that water rights, 
supplied by new development and developments which expand the use previously 
allowed on the property or for which the district had planned to provide 
service, are adequate to meet the needs of the new or expanded use ...&quot;</p>
<p>A lighthearted yet relevant analogy supplied by Gene Tautges, assistant 
general manager for the district, further illustrates the intent.</p> 
<p>Citing a local tract of pasture consisting of one horse, a single faucet 
and a bathtub trough as an example, &quot;The parcel is within the district, so 
the district is responsible for providing water to that faucet, which fills the 
tub and allows the horse to drink,&quot; said Tautges.</p> 
<p>&quot;But let's say the land is sold and all of sudden someone wants to put 
a five-story hotel on the property,&quot; added Tautges.</p> 
<p>&quot;This resolution basically says a huge developer can't just come in 
and change the use of that little hydrant and expect the district to cover the 
costs,&quot; concluded Tautges.</p> 
<p>As a result, district staff will now evaluate the adequacy of water rights 
based on a set of new guidelines established in the resolution.</p> 
<p>For example, even though a property may be within the district, if adequate 
water rights have not been dedicated for the proposed/increased use, &quot;any 
district commitment to serve will not be issued until the dedication is made as 
provided herein.&quot;</p> 
<p>In addition, any new development or expansions of use may require &quot;the 
dedication of water rights equal to 120 percent of the water expected to be 
required by the new proposed use or expansion of use.&quot;</p> 
<p>Also, the resolution requires the developer, property owner or 
&quot;proponent of the expanded development or use&quot; to provide the 
district staff with a comprehensive report addressing numerous aspects 
associated with an increase in water use. </p> 
<p>Complete copies of the resolution are available at the district office, 100 
Lyn Avenue.</p> 
<p>Construction update</p> 
<p>According to Carrie Campbell, district general manager, progress continues 
on the Stevens Reservoir and Dutton Ditch projects.</p> 
<p>At Campbell's request, the board authorized pursuit of a &quot;full title 
policy&quot; that is expected to augment ongoing negotiations with residents 
who own property at the Stevens site.</p> 
<p>In an update regarding the Dutton Ditch encasement project, Campbell 
indicated the Army Corps of Engineers is currently reviewing the initiative to 
see what type of permit - either &quot;nationwide&quot; or 
&quot;full-fledged&quot; - the project will require.</p> 
<p>Campbell said she feels a &quot;nationwide&quot; permit is probably 
appropriate and hopes that is the eventual determination &quot;because it makes 
the process a lot simpler.&quot; </p> 
<p>In other construction-related updates, Campbell revealed the district's 
year-to-date total for completed water connections stands at 51.</p> 
<p>That figure is down from 2003's year-to-date total of 74, and significantly 
lower than 2002's mark of 97. </p> 
<p>Though the district currently has 23 additional connections pending, said 
Campbell, only two are scheduled at present and &quot;the bottom line is, you 
could probably come in here on a Wednesday and we could do your tap 
Friday.&quot;</p> 
<p>In addition, Campbell informed the board Tuesday that an irrigation 
agreement between the district, town of Pagosa Springs and Archuleta School 
District 50 Joint has been finalized.</p> 
<p>In the works for three years, the agreement provides for irrigation water 
to be pumped from the San Juan River and supplied to a number of sites in the 
downtown area, the most recent of which being the town sports complex.</p> 
<p>The agreement also calls for future supplies to Reservoir Hill and 
Centennial Park.</p> 
<p>Finally, Art Holloman, district superintendent, indicated pumping 
operations at the recently-completed Loma Linda pumping station began Tuesday 
morning.</p>

district Web site at www.pawsd.org.</p> 
<p>Lake levels</p> 
<p>The latest readings provided by the district indicate current reservoir 
storage is approximately 134 percent over the district's minimum-reserve goal 
of 1,800 acre feet.</p> 
<p>District reservoirs were at the following levels early this week:</p> 
<p>- Lake Hatcher - 17 inches below spillway</p> 
<p>- Stevens Reservoir - 100 percent full </p> 
<p>- Lake Pagosa - 100 percent full </p> 
<p>- Lake Forest - six inches below spillway</p> 
<p>- Village Lake - 26 inches below spillway. </p>

<p><b>County Clerk issues plea for poll judges</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Clerk's office has issued a call for precinct polling 
place judges for upcoming elections.</p> 
<p>June Madrid, county clerk, said, Colorado law used to require an equal 
number of Democrats and Republicans at each polling place at any election.</p> 
<p>The law has changed in the last couple of years in an attempt to make 
obtaining judges easier, she said. It now allows unaffiliated voters and 
qualifying high school students to serve as judges and for judges to serve in a 
precinct other than their own.</p> 
<p>Madrid said the county did not receive enough names from the caucus process 
from either party and &quot;we are in dire need of Democrat judges in some 
precincts.&quot;</p> 
<p>The pay is approximately $110 for the day and all selected must attend one 
class that explains what you will do.</p> 
<p>&quot;The hours are long,&quot; Madrid said, &quot;from 6 a.m. to 
approximately 9 p.m.&quot;</p> 
<p>She said the election judges &quot;are an intricate part of our election 
process and those who serve are an extremely important factor in upholding the 
integrity of the elections.&quot;</p> 
<p>Judges are needed for the primary election Aug. 10 and the general election 
Nov. 2.</p> 
<p>Other counties, Madrid said, see elections as a good opportunity for 
organizations to make money.</p> 
<p>&quot;If a church or group would like to supply judges for a polling place, 
the money could go to that organization or church,&quot; she said. 
&quot;Students can participate to make money on their own or for a school 
function. In larger counties different companies provide the appropriate judges 
as do civic organizations.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;If anyone is interested,&quot; she said, &quot;please consider this a 
plea for help.&quot;</p> 
<p>Anyone willing to serve should call the clerk's office, 264-8350 or 
264-8354, and leave their name and telephone number as soon as possible.</p> 
<p>Here are some of the situations one might encounter on election day, as a 
judge or a voter.</p> 
<p>You arrive at the polling place where you've cast ballots for the last 10 
years, enter the building and approach the election judges' table. Sitting 
there is the same person who has worked as an election judge each of the 
previous 10 times you voted.</p> 
<p>The judge greets you warmly by name and then asks for some identification 
before letting you vote.</p> 
<p>No, the judge isn't suffering short-term memory loss.</p> 
<p>During the 2003 legislative session, the General Assembly of Colorado 
passed three bills requiring presentation of photo identification at your 
polling place before you are allowed to vote.</p> 
<p>The most common form is a valid Colorado driver's license; however, any one 
of the following will also suffice:</p> 
<p>- a current and valid Colorado Department of Revenue issued identification 
card</p> 
<p>- a current and valid United States passport</p> 
<p>- a current and valid employee identification card with a photograph of the 
eligible voter issued by any branch, department, agency or entity of the United 
States government or of this state or by any county, municipality, board 
authority or other political subdivision of this state</p> 
<p>- a current and valid pilot's license for the eligible voter issued by the 
Federal Aviation Administration or other authorized agency of the United States
</p> 
<p>- a current and valid United States military identification card with a 
photograph of the eligible voter </p> 
<p>- a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, 
paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the 
elector</p> 
<p>- a Medicaid or Medicare card.</p> 
<p>These acceptable forms of identification must show a Colorado address.</p> 
<p>Even if you don't have one of those forms, you might be entitled to vote a 
provisional ballot at the polling place. A provisional ballot is a regular 
ballot but is placed in a larger envelope and requires the voter to fill in 
information and mark a reason why the provisional ballot is being requested. 
</p> 
<p>The law does not allow these ballots to be counted on election night. They 
must be verified after the election, then counted and added to the election 
night totals.</p> 
<p>Madrid said Colorado law was recently changed to conform to the Help 
America Vote Act of 2002 signed by President Bush.</p> 
<p>It was designed to further secure the integrity of the election process, 
she said.</p> 
<p>Secretary of State Donetta Davidson said, &quot;Voters have unplugged from 
the election process because of what happened in the 2000 presidential 
election. We want voters to freely exercise their rights to vote. In order to 
do so, we want to make sure that when citizens of Colorado go to the polls, 
each has proper identification.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;By taking proper identification to the polling place,&quot; she 
added, &quot;voters of Colorado ensure that our elections are accessible, 
accurate and accountable.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Crews monitor Middle Fork Fire northwest of Pagosa Springs</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A wildland fire burning 19 miles northwest of Pagosa Springs in the 
Weminuche Wilderness has grown to about 40 acres since it was first reported 
June 15.</p> 
<p>That includes the entire perimeter of the fire; the area actually burning 
is spotty and much smaller.</p> 
<p>According to a news release from the San Juan Public Lands Center in 
Durango, the lightning-started Middle Fork Fire is burning at an elevation of 
9,720 feet about 1.5 miles northeast of the Middle Fork Trailhead.</p> 
<p>The fire is burning mostly on the ground and is currently surrounded by 
upper elevation terrain on the north and by rock escarpments on the south. Snow 
still exists on north aspects and in the upper elevations north of the fire. 
The fire has backed down to within 50 yards of the Middle Fork of the Piedra 
River.</p> 
<p>It is being managed for Wildland Fire Use, meaning that it is being allowed 
to burn in an attempt to reach a more natural fire regime in the wilderness. A 
fire can qualify for Wildland Fire Use management, as opposed to full 
suppression, if it is naturally caused and does not threaten populated areas.
</p> 
<p>The Black Hills Fire Use Module, a team of seven fire specialists from 
South Dakota, is conducting air and ground reconnaissance to monitor fire 
behavior, spread and smoke. However, because of the rough and inaccessible 
terrain, fire managers believe it would be unsafe to put firefighters in the 
area at this time. The crew is camped at the Middle Fork Trailhead.</p> 
<p>The fire is also being mapped and monitored by daily helicopter flights 
originating from Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Fire monitors reported some precipitation in the area Monday. Cool 
temperatures and increased humidity associated with storm cells have reduced 
the spread of the fire.</p> 
<p>A Long Term Fire Analyst (LTAN) is assigned to the fire and is working to 
predict long term fire behavior, and to model and map possible future fire 
growth.</p>

<p><b>Landfill fire flares three times, cause undetermined</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A fire at the landfill on Trujillo Road flared up three times early this 
week before being extinguished.</p> 
<p>According to Archuleta County Sheriff's reports, Deputy Richard Robinson 
first responded to the fire about 4:30 p.m. June 20 on the heels of Pagosa Fire 
Protection District personnel.</p> 
<p>Two county wildland fire trucks and two fire district trucks, plus 
personnel, fought visible flames covering about a quarter acre in the dump. The 
district's volunteer firefighters were released about two hours later and 
county crews finished mop-up about 10 p.m. A patrol unit was sent out 
periodically to check on some debris left smoldering.</p> 
<p>About 3 a.m., flames were spotted by Deputy Ryan Clark. Robinson returned 
to the scene with a wildland engine and doused three hot spots that had flared 
into flames again, remaining on scene until 7 a.m.</p> 
<p>Clark and Deputy Richard Valdez responded to the scene a third time when a 
column of smoke was spotted about 9 p.m. June 21. The fire has not flared up 
again.</p> 
<p>Fire Chief Warren Grams said he suspects, with recent chilly mornings, 
someone threw wood ashes or charcoal briquettes into the trash which later 
ignited at the landfill. Spontaneous combustion could also be the cause, he 
said.</p>

<p><b>Scenery could be changing on the west side of town </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The south side of U.S. 160 west of downtown Pagosa Springs boasts little 
besides trees and grass. That could be changing.</p> 
<p>Tuesday, the Pagosa Springs Planning Commission recommended approval of the 
first phase of a 75-acre commercial and residential development planned on the 
site, located near U.S. 160 and Alpha Drive.</p> 
<p>The applicant, John Ranson, of Pagosa Partners, LLC, said full development 
will occur in several phases over eight or 10 years. In the first phase, they 
are focusing on 8.75 acres to include a total of eight commercial lots and 
infrastructure development.</p> 
<p>The planning commission recommended approval of the plan, on the condition 
that the developers receive approval from the Colorado Department of 
Transportation on an access plan. The developers have submitted a request for 
temporary access at Boulder Drive - currently the turn to First Baptist Church. 
Eventually, a permanent signalized intersection will be created at what is now 
the entrance to the Timber Ridge sales office.</p> 
<p>Several property owners from the Alpha Subdivision, just south of the 
proposed development, spoke against any effort to connect new development with 
roads maintained under their metro district.</p> 
<p>Patsy Linbald, president of the Alpha Property Owners Association, said the 
group rejects any new roads into the subdivision because of increased traffic, 
dust and maintenance costs as well as negative impacts on privacy and property 
values.</p> 
<p>Ranson said the first phase would not impact the Alpha Subdivision roads, 
though later improvements required by CDOT could impact their access to the 
highway somewhat because Alpha Drive is slated to become a right-in, right-out 
only intersection under the state's highway plan for U.S. 160.</p> 
<p>As far as making the connection between the two, planning commission 
chairman Rice Reavis said, the connection point lies outside town boundaries. 
Decisions there are in the hands of the county, the metro district and the 
developer.</p> 
<p>In other business, the commission also recommended approval on a final plat 
for the Riverwalk Townhomes, a development of five townhomes on South 6th 
Street.</p> 
<p>The applicant, Chris Smith, thanked the board for working with him to 
vacate half of Navajo Street that traveled through the property.</p> 
<p>&quot;It allowed us to design an ingress and an egress for the 
property,&quot; he said. &quot;It really made the project come together. We 
couldn't have made it without that.&quot;</p> 
<p>He said the project has been designed to complement the feel of some of the 
other recent construction downtown and will include six street lights.</p> 
<p>A separate agreement is being created for the property to address 
pedestrian access and improvements because the final plan for river restoration 
work on that stretch of the San Juan has not been completed.</p> 
<p>The town council has final approval or denial authority on both of these 
projects. They are scheduled to come before the council July 6 at 5 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Town planning commission considers tree conservation</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Town staff floated the idea of a tree conservation ordinance past Pagosa 
Springs planning commission ears for the first time Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Tamra Allen, town planner, said a cursory review of other communities in 
the state showed that several have ordinances on the books that require 
developers to save a certain percentages of older trees on their property, or 
to save trees of a certain size. Other communities require developers to 
mitigate the loss of trees through reforestation on another property or through 
replacement efforts.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm looking for some kind of knee-jerk reaction, a recommendation on 
this,&quot; she said. Local arborist Chris Pierce has offered to help create a 
tree conservation ordinance on a pro bono basis. Allen said it might be 
possible to use his expertise on a broader citizens' committee appointed to 
look at the issue. However, she said, because of the busy summer season it 
might not be possible to start the process until the fall.</p> 
<p>Commission Chairman Rice Reavis said it is &quot;an excellent idea.&quot; 
Other commission members were a little more cautious.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think you have to be very careful about how you do something like 
this,&quot; Tracy Bunning said. &quot;Take the strip along the south side of 
U.S. 160 there. If a piece of property is going to be developed, I doubt 
leaving all those trees is going to be part of the plan.&quot;</p> 
<p>He said a replacement plan or requirement that the developer present a plan 
for tree removal to the commission prior to cutting might work better than an 
ordinance saying trees couldn't be cut on personal property.</p> 
<p>He gave the example of trees in front of the Pagosa Lodge, and those in 
front of the new Wells Fargo building. In both cases, older trees were left in 
place. They died anyway.</p> 
<p>Mayor Ross Aragon asked Allen to present more detailed information to the 
commission, including a map of where the trees are located that need protection.
</p> 
<p>&quot;If we told people they can or cannot cut trees, I think that goes too 
far,&quot; he said.</p>

<p><b>West Nile a real threat; mosquito control urged </b></p> 
<p>How concerned are you about West Nile virus?</p> 
<p>Perhaps you're operating under the philosophy that &quot;it won't happen to 
me&quot; or &quot;it's not in my backyard.&quot;</p> 
<p>West Nile is a real threat in this country. Unless your city or town has a 
mosquito-control program, you could be at serious risk.</p> 
<p>Just look at what happened to the folks from Fort Collins. The city was hit 
hard by the virus last year with 228 cases. It had no mosquito management 
programs in place when the mosquito season began. Fortunately, an emergency 
mosquito-spraying program implemented in late August helped bring a quick end 
to the epidemic.</p> 
<p>Before the spraying began, 211 people in Fort Collins and its immediate 
vicinity had contracted the potentially fatal virus. After spraying, only 17 
cases were reported in the area through the remainder of the season.</p> 
<p>According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
the drop in cases in that city was far more dramatic than the gradual decrease 
in infection rates in the rest of the state.</p> 
<p><b>On the move</b></p> 
<p>This year, the mosquito-borne virus is continuing its westward trek across 
the country. In 2003, there were 9,858 human cases of West Nile virus and 262 
deaths.</p> 
<p>&quot;West Nile virus poses a serious threat to the public health and 
communities need to be prepared,&quot; says Allen James, president of RISE 
(Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment), an association of suppliers 
that promotes the safe and responsible use of pest control products including 
mosquito control products used in and around homes, businesses and public areas.
</p> 
<p>And all age groups are susceptible to the virus. While it was previously 
believed that it primarily posed a threat to senior citizens, a number of 
states have been reporting serious cases of the virus in individuals in their 
30s and 40s.</p> 
<p>Though many people infected with West Nile only experience flu-like 
symptoms, some may contract meningitis and lifelong polio-like symptoms, and 
some may die.</p> 
<p><b>Plan of action</b></p> 
<p>An Integrated Mosquito Management program is the best way to contain the 
spread of the virus and prevent human infections, James says. This balanced, 
integrated approach encompasses four components:</p> 
<p>1. educating the public about prevention measures</p> 
<p>2. surveillance and monitoring of mosquitoes and West Nile virus </p> 
<p>3. sanitation and maintenance</p> 
<p>4. natural and chemical controls.</p> 
<p>James says that in addition to taking precautions to avoid being bitten by 
mosquitoes, citizens should check with their local governments to learn how 
they are controlling the spread of the virus in their areas. &quot;And if no 
mosquito-control programs are in place, urge them to implement one,&quot; he 
says.</p> 
<p><b>Spraying the answer?</b></p> 
<p>Some critics claim it is unnecessary to spray pesticides to prevent the 
spread of West Nile virus. But experts say not spraying puts communities and 
human health at serious risk.</p> 
<p>&quot;The reality is that the risk posed by West Nile virus is much greater 
than any risk associated with mosquito-control pesticides, which have been 
extensively tested and are registered with the Environmental Protection 
Agency,&quot; says James, noting the EPA and the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention endorse responsible pesticide use as an integral part of 
the solution to help protect people from West Nile virus.</p> 
<p>&quot;The risks associated with proper use of pesticides are so low that 
one cannot document any lasting effects,&quot; says James. &quot;There are no 
known deaths from spraying these products. The same cannot be said for the 
victims of West Nile virus.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Precautions</b></p> 
<p>While mosquito prevention is a nationwide concern, there are some simple 
steps you can take to limit the spread and impact of the disease:</p> 
<p>- mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Prevent new batches by 
draining birdbaths, flowerpots and any other items that may collect water</p> 
<p>- when spending time outdoors during mosquito season, use a topical insect 
repellent to keep potentially dangerous mosquitoes at bay. If possible, avoid 
the outdoors in the early morning hours and at dusk, times when mosquitoes are 
more likely to be out</p> 
<p>- rally your community to action. Encourage local lawmakers to institute an 
integrated mosquito management program if there isn't one in your area.</p>

<p><b>Senior center staff can help residents select drug card </b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs residents on Medicare can save money on prescriptions with 
the new Medicare-approved drug cards, but confusion is keeping some consumers 
from signing up.</p> 
<p>Coloradans have more than 40 Medicare-approved drug card choices, but can 
choose only one of the cards.</p> 
<p>The Silver Foxes Den Senior Center is providing assistance to Archuleta 
County Medicare consumers to make these choices.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our staff has been trained on these issues, and are receiving 
information and handout materials from Medicare and the Access to Benefits 
Coalition Rx-Colorado to get consumers the information they need to 
decide,&quot; said Musetta Wollenweber, Silver Foxes Den Senior Center director.
</p> 
<p>&quot;We also know that which card a consumer picks really makes a 
difference pricewise. For example, Prilosec 20 mg was priced as low as $106 and 
as high as $144 under the various drug cards. We'll help consumers find those 
drug cards that consistently provide lower costs.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Senior Center is also concerned that those who qualify for a $600 drug 
credit in 2004 apply for that new Medicare help. Any Medicare recipient who 
does not have drug insurance from a former employer or Medicaid and who meets 
income guidelines qualifies. Couples must have income of $16,862 or less, and 
singles $12,569 or less.</p> 
<p>&quot;The $600 credit is very easy to apply for. The application form is 
short, assets like your investments and home are not considered, and you don't 
have to send in tax forms or other proof of income,&quot; Wollenweber said. 
&quot;And those who qualify will automatically receive a second $600 drug 
credit in 2005.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Silver Foxes Den Senior Center will also help consumers learn about 
some related programs that can save them money like the Together Rx drug 
discount card, Medicare Savings Programs, and BenefitsCheckUp of Colorado.</p> 
<p>Consumers can obtain some of this information themselves. Medicare operates 
a Web site where consumers can list their zip code and the drugs they take, and 
then generate a customized list of their drug prices through the various cards 
at local participating pharmacies. They call also call (800) Medicare and 
request the computer list, but this service has been overwhelmed with calls. 
The (800) Medicare line operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and callers 
are advised to contact them outside normal business hours to have shorter wait 
time.</p> 
<p>&quot;But we are here and ready to help those who prefer local help and 
face-to-face assistance. Our Medicare counselors are available at the senior 
center Mondays 11 - 1,&quot; Wollenweber said.</p> 
<p>The Silver Foxes Den Senior Center can be reached by calling 264-2167. 
Coloradans call also call (800) 503-5190 and be connected to local help 
organizations across the state.</p>

<p>The Humane Society invites everyone, especially kids and their pets, to 
Town Park Saturday.</p> 
<p>It's a special day, one filled with activities 8 a.m.-2 p.m. The best part 
is that pets are invited - the one event of the year where every kid (and 
parent) can feel secure that their pup or pet snake or goat or whatever is 
welcome. The only caveat is to be sure that your pet is comfortable with other 
pets and lots of people.</p> 
<p>KWUF radio will provide live coverage of the event 10 a.m.-1 p.m. </p> 
<p>The day begins with the Canine 9K at 8 a.m. and Fun Run at 8:05 with 
registration beginning at 7. Sally Hameister will start the race. There is 
still time to pick up registration forms in advance at the Humane Society 
Thrift Store or the shelter; $15 for adults and $10 for kids.</p> 
<p>Runners and walkers will follows Hot Springs Boulevard out Light Plant Road 
to the turnaround and back to Town Park. Water for both humans and canines will 
be provided along the route and all runners will receive a T-shirt. Winners, of 
course, will receive ribbons.</p> 
<p>There is also still time to register for the Paws Parade in the Park at the 
Humane Society Thrift Store or the shelter. Prizes will be awarded to best 
costume, owner pet look-alike, and celebrity look-alike. Cost is 50 cents to 
register and the applications forms are available at the Humane Society Thrift 
Store and the shelter.</p> 
<p>A few spaces for vendors of pet related products are still available. Booth 
space is $10. Contact Annette Foor at the Humane Society administrative office, 
264-5549. To date we have Rocky Mountain Reefs and Ponds, Animan the mobile 
groomer, the Invisible Fence and Pagosa Photography.</p> 
<p>For the second year, The Humane Society is calling for a reunion of all who 
have adopted pets from this shelter or any other. As an acknowledgment of these 
folks, a group picture by a professional photographer is scheduled. These are 
the folks who make the concept of sheltering possible and they deserve the 
thanks of the society and the community at large.</p> 
<p>The 4-H involvement with Pet Pride Day is new this year. As a fund-raiser, 
4-H will provide food for the day and as part of their projects will bring a 
draft goat and a fiber goat - the former will provide rides for the little ones 
and the latter lots of fun petting.</p> 
<p>The Humane Society also has planned for your enjoyment and benefit: 
Blessing of the Animals, pet inoculations, microchipping, a llamas obstacle 
demonstration, a Canine Good Citizenship Evaluation, a presentation about 
wolves, a breed showcase, pet massage, homemade dog biscuits, pet photographs, 
face painting, and, of course, contest for every imaginable type of pet, 
including a Best Pet Photo Contest judged by a professional photographer</p>

<p><b>County to receive $522,307 as its PILT fund share </b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County is set to receive $522,307 as its share of $17.6 million 
coming to Colorado in the federal government's Payment-in- lieu-of tax (PILT) 
program.</p> 
<p>U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis announced the payment schedule June 18. </p> 
<p>The funds, administered by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM), compensate counties for nontaxable federal lands located 
within their boundaries.</p> 
<p>&quot;Nowhere is PILT more important than it is to us in rural 
Colorado,&quot; said McInnis. &quot;We rely on these programs to replace lost 
tax revenue dollars that go toward everything from roads to schools and social 
services.&quot;</p> 
<p>Congress authorized the PILT program in 1976, recognizing that counties and 
other local government entities with substantial acreage of federal land could 
not collect sufficient taxes to provide needed services or were taxing fewer 
residents at higher rates to provide services.</p> 
<p>McInnis, who has introduced separate legislation that would fully fund PILT 
and the Refuge Revenue Sharing program, has many counties in his sprawling 
western Colorado district that rely heavily on the payments.</p> 
<p>Since the program's inception, the value of federal payments to local 
governments under the program has been substantially eroded by inflation. In 
1994, Congress attempted to address this concern by increasing the program's 
authorization levels. However, Congress' appropriations to PILT have failed to 
meet those authorization levels in the years since, a fact that McInnis' bill 
sets out to change.</p> 
<p>&quot;These federal dollars are much needed and will be well spent. But it 
is not enough,&quot; concluded McInnis. &quot;As it stands now, our locally 
elected officials are in a financial straightjacket, and only Congress can 
provide them the relief they need.&quot;</p> 
<p>The BLM administers the PILT program because it is the largest single 
federal land management agency, with responsibility for over 264 million acres 
of public land. Payments are made for BLM administered lands, national forests, 
parks, and wildlife refuges; land used for federal water projects; and some 
military installations.</p>

<p><b>Its the right time of the year to adopt a cat </b></p> 
<p><b>By Robbie Schwartz</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>'Tis the season that animal shelters are filled with cats and kittens, 
making it an ideal time to adopt.</p> 
<p>To encourage adoption, the Humane Society of Pagosa Springs joins The 
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and Fresh 
Step, to proclaim June as Adopt-a Shelter-Cat Month. Celebrate with us today by 
visiting the cats at the Humane Society of Pagosa Springs and at Petfinder.com, 
the ASPCA's online adoption partner.</p> 
<p>Owning a cat is a long-term commitment and therefore deserves serious 
thought. A good place to begin is to understand that cats know they are family 
members rather than possessions. They consider themselves the leaders of their 
families.</p> 
<p>As heads of their households, cats want things their way. That may mean 
drinking from the faucet or walking across the kitchen table.</p> 
<p>Cats like to be the center of attention, and they always detect where your 
attention is centered, whether that be the open pages of the book you are 
reading or on the keyboard of your computer.</p> 
<p>It takes considerable confidence to love a cat - one moment they are 
cuddling up looking for love and the next they are up and away, tail and nose 
in air - leaving you thinking, &quot;What have I done wrong?&quot; However, cat 
lovers swear by the ease and independence of caring for pets of the feline 
persuasion. Catlovers don't pussy foot around: they know the little purrballs 
are the cat's meow.</p> 
<p>The Humane Society of Pagosa Springs has cats in all sizes, ages and 
colors, not to mention a myriad of purr-sonalities. Adoption rate for cats is 
discounted 50 percent and at only $22.50 which includes your new feline friend 
being spay/neutered, vaccinated and microchipped, how can you resist?</p>

<p><b>Pets for people matches seniors with free pets</b></p> 
<p>The Purina Pets for People Program works with the Humane Society of Pagosa 
Springs and participating humane organizations to offer companion animals to 
qualified senior citizens, 60 years of age or older, free-of-charge.</p> 
<p>Studies have shown that pet companionship may actually improve senior 
citizen health and outlook on life. Lowered blood pressure and stress reduction 
are among the benefits of pet ownership. In addition, seniors acquiring pets 
through the program report feeling happier and safer.</p> 
<p>The program covers the cost of adoption fees for pets one year of age and 
older.</p> 
<p>To apply for the program, seniors should call the humane society at 
731-4771. A shelter staffer will advise seniors about the background 
information on any animal they are interested in.</p> 
<p>There is a wide variety of pets to choose from. Come to the humane society 
and fill out a pre-adoption questionnaire during our adoption hours: 10 a.m.-5 
p.m., Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m.-4 p.m., on Sunday. Staff will be 
happy to answer your questions and help you find the animal that fits you and 
your lifestyle.</p> 
<p>All animals in the adoption program are spayed/neutered, have current 
vaccinations, permanent microchip identification and more.</p>

<p><b>Merchants launch second year of rainbow trout stocking </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Want a chance to hook up with a double-digit rainbow trout without leaving 
city limits?</p> 
<p>Thanks to the efforts of numerous local merchants, you don't have to look 
any further than the stretch of San Juan River that runs through downtown 
Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>For the second consecutive year, the &quot;Pagosa Quality Fishing 
Project,&quot; a stocking program made possible by entirely private donations, 
is upping the odds local and visiting anglers alike will meet with success 
along the shores of the San Juan.</p> 
<p>Last week's stocking - the first of three scheduled this summer - consisted 
of approximately 500 pounds of plump rainbows.</p> 
<p>As a result, the portion of the San Juan between the U.S. 84-160 
intersection and the footbridge behind the county courthouse is ripe for 
angling exploration.</p> 
<p>The program was spearheaded last year by businessmen Larry Fisher and 
Thaddeus Cano and moved forward after eventually getting the green light from 
the Colorado Division of Wildlife.</p> 
<p>Local businesses and private citizens then began donating to the program, 
which is aimed at augmenting the DOW's scheduled stockings and restoring trout 
populations that suffered during 2002's record drought.</p> 
<p>A few of the trout released during last summer's project were huge, but 
more than one of the rainbows planted last week are the type of fish most 
anglers see only in their dreams.</p> 
<p>&quot;The majority are in the range of about 11-13 inches,&quot; said Cano. 
&quot;But we've also got some fish in the 16-20 inch range and a few that are 
anywhere from about six to 10 pounds.&quot;</p> 
<p>Cano indicated a second 500-pound stocking is set for the end of this 
month, with a third to follow sometime in July.</p> 
<p>As far as participation in this year's program, Cano said at least 15 area 
businesses have contributed to the cause thus far, and indicated additional 
donations will be greatly appreciated.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll take the smallest of donations,&quot; said Cano. &quot;Even if 
someone wants to donate just a single fish, we'll take it.&quot;</p> 
<p>For larger fish, the cost is $5 per pound. The rate for smaller fish is 
$3.10 per pound.</p> 
<p>The fish, which are certified as whirling-disease free, are transported 
from Cline Trout Farms in Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>Anyone interested in donating to the program can contact Cano at 264-2370.
</p> 
<p>Finally, there is more good news for anglers planning to test the waters of 
the San Juan this summer.</p> 
<p>According to Mike Japhet, a fisheries biologist with the DOW, the Division 
plans to stock the San Juan with over 12,000 rainbow trout (at least 3,100 fish 
in the 10-inch range each stocking) on four occasions between now and early 
August.</p> 
<p>&quot;The main goal for stocking this size of rainbow trout is purely 
recreational; we want people to catch these fish,&quot; said Japhet.</p> 
<p>In addition, the DOW plans to stock 5,000 brown trout fingerlings in late 
August or early September.</p> 
<p>&quot;The aim is for this to be a put-and-grow type of stocking,&quot; 
concluded Japhet. &quot;By next spring, these fish will also be of catchable 
size.&quot;</p>

<p><b>State's native trout subspecies gaining population</b></p> 
<p><b>By Todd Malmsbury</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to the SUN</b></p> 
<p>After years of recovery work and challenges that have included wildfires 
and a prolonged drought, Colorado Division of Wildlife officials are reporting 
good progress in creating new populations of Colorado River, Rio Grande, and 
greenback cutthroat trout both in the wild and at state hatcheries.</p> 
<p>Populations of the state's native trout subspecies had dwindled 
dramatically before greenback cutthroat recovery efforts began in the 1970s. 
The state's bid to return cutthroat trout to their historic range took on a new 
perspective in 1997 when the Colorado Wildlife Commission issued a 
high-priority directive guiding management polices and long-term goals.</p> 
<p>State biologists are now seeing the payoff. Colorado currently has 29 
conservation populations of greenback cutthroat trout; 76 conservation 
populations of Rio Grande cutthroat trout; and 171 conservation populations of 
Colorado River cutthroat trout.</p> 
<p>When the greenback conservation program began in 1973, the state could 
claim only two naturally occurring populations of the subspecies. Since then, 
14 more wild populations have been discovered and the state has added 13 
restored populations.</p> 
<p>Colorado met its state delisting goal when it achieved 10 populations of 
Rio Grande cutthroat in 1985. In 1998, the state had 87 stream populations of 
conservation-rated Colorado River cutthroats and nine lake populations.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have made some extraordinary progress in six years,&quot; said 
Sherman Hebein, division senior fish biologist, referring to Colorado River 
cutthroat recovery efforts.</p> 
<p>While overall cutthroat numbers have improved, some individual populations 
are small and at greater risk of extirpation, which means the recovery program 
will likely continue for years to come. State and federal biologists recently 
conducted a rangewide review of the status of Colorado River cutthroats, and 
results are expected to be released in July.</p> 
<p>Cutthroat trout have inhabited the state for thousands of years, and 
wildlife aquatic biologists and hatchery technicians are committed to 
preserving the region's natural legacy, said Tom Nesler, native fish species 
coordinator for the DOW's species conservation section.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our cutthroat subspecies have been pushed back from their historic 
range,&quot; Nesler said. &quot;We are attempting to secure these three native 
trout subspecies so they can continue to form part of our aquatic wildlife 
heritage.&quot;</p> 
<p>Biologists blame the decline of Colorado's cutthroats on hybridization with 
rainbow trout and competition with other non-native trout that were introduced 
to the state a century ago. Habitat destruction, poor water quality, drought, 
and human activities such as gold mining have also taken a toll on the speckled 
fish with crimson neck markings.</p> 
<p>As a result of these impacts, the greenback cutthroat has been listed 
federally as a threatened subspecies, and the Colorado River cutthroat has been 
displaced from more than 80 percent of its historic range, inhabiting only 
smaller headwater streams and high-altitude lakes.</p> 
<p>Concern for the Colorado River and Rio Grande subspecies has prompted 
environmental groups to petition for their listing as well. However, recent 
assessments by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended against their 
listing because multi-state recovery efforts have been effective in reversing 
declines and reducing threats to the two subspecies.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have three very active conservation programs for our three native 
cutthroat subspecies,&quot; Nesler said. &quot;The condition of the Colorado 
River and Rio Grande cutthroats is such that the trout's status and our 
accomplishments have precluded any need to have them protected by federal 
listing. We have demonstrated that we are actively trying to improve the status 
of these two trout subspecies and are trying to create new populations and 
expand habitat.&quot;</p> 
<p>Nesler and others said native cutthroat populations are making a slow and 
steady recovery because of the creation of new wild populations, the creation 
of captive populations in state hatcheries for stocking purposes, and 
interagency collaboration on goals and strategies among federal and state 
wildlife biologists in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico.</p> 
<p>In 1999, Colorado joined other state, federal and private entities in 
signing the Tri-State Colorado River Cutthroat Trout Conservation Agreement 
with Utah and Wyoming.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, the state signed the Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout 
Conservation Agreement with New Mexico. Division officials said Colorado could 
not have progressed as far and as quickly as it did without the cooperation of 
the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.</p> 
<p>While Colorado currently has enough greenback cutthroat trout to meet its 
recovery goal, wildlife officials acknowledge that a prolonged drought has had 
a negative impact on some populations and fish have been rescued from rapidly 
drying streams.</p> 
<p>Rich Kolecki, Colorado's hatchery chief, who oversees 20 facilities in the 
statewide system, said securing sufficient cutthroat populations in state 
hatcheries to stock lakes and streams is vital to recovery efforts. As such, 
hatchery technicians must develop broodstocks to increase or amplify the number 
of fish available for restoration projects.</p> 
<p>In essence, hatchery personnel are helping nature by increasing the 
survivability of the eggs and fry, which in the wild can experience up to 99 
percent mortality. In Colorado, cutthroat trout that are rescued in the wild 
are taken to isolation units in Salida and Rifle before they are transferred to 
one of several quarantine facilities around the state. Hatchery personnel are 
then able to develop new broodstocks from the offspring of rescued fish.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are very careful about bringing live fish into our state 
hatcheries because of disease that the parent fish may carry, however, their 
eggs can be disinfected,&quot; Kolecki said.</p> 
<p>Kolecki said cutthroats are more sensitive to poorer water quality. 
Hatchery technicians must put the fish in first-use water and feed them a 
special, more expensive diet that is fortified with protein, amino acids and 
double vitamin packs.</p> 
<p>&quot;They are high-maintenance fish, but they are important 
high-maintenance fish,&quot; Kolecki said. &quot;A lot of the problems that 
these species are having are directly associated with humans. Now that we have 
the ability and the technology to address these situations, it's part of our 
mission to save them.&quot;</p> 
<p>Pure subpopulations of the greenback can be found in the Arkansas and the 
South Platte basins. DOW hatcheries presently have two pure greenback 
broodstocks from the Arkansas and South Platte rivers and four Colorado River 
cutthroat broodstocks from the White, Colorado, Dolores and San Juan rivers.</p>
<p>Dan Brauch, a division aquatic biologist in Gunnison who is involved with 
interstate efforts to recover cutthroat trout, said Colorado wants to establish 
additional pure, non-hybridized populations of Colorado River cutthroat trout 
on six major rivers on the Western Slope, including the Yampa, the White, the 
Colorado, the Gunnison, the Dolores and the San Juan drainages.</p> 
<p>&quot;The entire Western Slope region is within the Colorado River 
cutthroat range. The long-term goal is to maintain current populations and 
establish new ones, and to ensure that the Colorado River cutthroat trout as a 
subspecies remains in good condition,&quot; Brauch said.</p> 
<p>Brauch said another goal for Colorado is to manage the recovery effort in a 
way that provides angling opportunities for fishermen. Because native cutthroat 
trout have become less common than other salmonids, many anglers search for 
opportunities to catch them.</p> 
<p>For now, greenback populations at recovery sites must be released back into 
state waters if they are caught. Greenbacks have also been stocked in high 
lakes and may be harvested. Most conservation populations of Colorado River 
cutthroat trout and Rio Grande cutthroat trout are also protected with 
catch-and-release regulations. Anglers should check the appropriate regulations 
before stopping at a specific fishing site, wildlife officials said.</p> 
<p>Brauch is confident Colorado's cutthroat recovery efforts are heading in a 
positive direction, despite the drought, wildfires and other challenges.</p> 
<p>&quot;If there are enough quality sites out there we can continue to 
recreationally fish for cutthroats. Certainly, that's part of what we are 
trying to maintain,&quot; he said. &quot;We've been able to establish many more 
populations. We'll continue to monitor those populations that have been 
impacted by the drought, and work as hard as we can to try to assist in their 
recovery.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Division of Wildlife gets new director</b></p> 
<p>Bruce McCloskey has been appointed as the new director of the Colorado 
Division of Wildlife (DOW).</p> 
<p>Russell George, executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural 
Resources (DNR), announced the appointment June 16.</p> 
<p>&quot;I have had the pleasure of working with Bruce for the past four years 
through the DOW, and for many years before that when I was in the Legislature 
and he served as lead spokesman for the DOW. I know for certain that he is the 
best person for the job,&quot; said George. &quot;I look forward to continuing 
our working relationship, and I know that Coloradans are fortunate to have 
Bruce leading the agency charged with protecting our wildlife resources.&quot;
</p> 
<p>McCloskey, who had been serving as acting director of the DOW, has been 
with the Department for over 30 years, serving in numerous positions, including 
deputy director, state wildlife manager, and district wildlife manager.</p> 
<p>A Colorado resident for 35 years, McCloskey received a B.S. in wildlife 
management from Colorado State University and a Master's degree in Public 
Administration from the University of Colorado.</p> 
<p>George pointed to McCloskey's more than 30 years of experience in wildlife 
management, as well as his already-established relationships with DOW 
employees, as aspects that made him a desirable candidate for his new position.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Bruce's dedication to wildlife management - specifically in Colorado 
- is simply unmatched,&quot; George said. &quot;He has long-standing 
relationships within the DOW and has served the agency in nearly every wildlife 
management position possible - clearly his dedication is matched only by his 
wealth of experience.&quot;</p> 
<p>McCloskey succeeds George, who was appointed by the governor as executive 
director of the DNR in January.</p>

<p><b>People trying to help lone young animals can put wildlife at risk </b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Randy Hampton</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Whether it's the 17th Fairway at Tiara Rado Golf Course in Grand Junction 
or the remote reaches of Douglas Pass, young wildlife is often left alone so 
the mother can take care of personal business.</p> 
<p>Unlike her human counterpart, a deer mother can't just leave Junior with 
the baby-sitter when she needs a break. Often, does will leave their fawns 
alone while they venture off to feed.</p> 
<p>&quot;This time of year, people often come across young deer or elk that 
may appear to have been abandoned,&quot; says Colorado Division of Wildlife 
(DOW) District Wildlife Manager Shaun Deeney. &quot;By trying to help, people 
can put the wildlife at risk.&quot;</p> 
<p>Deeney made a trip to the top of Douglas Pass recently to return a calf elk 
that had been carried into the division's Grand Junction regional service 
center.</p> 
<p>&quot;We had to make a decision about whether to try and return the animal 
to its mother, or send it to a wildlife rehabilitator to eventually be returned 
to the wild on its own,&quot; said Deeney. &quot;Because the person who brought 
the calf in was able to provide a very good description of the area where they 
found it, we opted to return the calf that same afternoon.&quot;</p> 
<p>Steve Yamashita, division assistant regional manager, added, &quot;That 
person thought they were doing the right thing.&quot;</p> 
<p>The calf had been found right in the middle of Colorado Highway 139, the 
winding road that crosses Douglas Pass. If an animal is in a place where it is 
in danger of being injured or killed, wildlife officers say moving the animal 
to the side of the road is the option that creates the best chance of survival.
</p> 
<p>A few days after Deeney returned the calf elk to Douglas Pass, Yamashita 
was with a group of golfers when they came upon a fawn in tall grass at Tiara 
Rado.</p> 
<p>&quot;It was easy to see how someone can think about taking the 
animal,&quot; said Yamashita, &quot;but, undoubtedly, the mother was nearby and 
would return when golf course traffic died down.&quot;</p> 
<p>Yamashita and the other golfers opted to leave the fawn alone, which is the 
suggested course of action in almost all cases.</p> 
<p>&quot;People are under the impression that if a calf or fawn is newborn its 
mother is with it at all times,&quot; said District Wildlife Manager Brett 
Ackerman, who oversees the area south of Rifle, where wildlife 
&quot;pickups&quot; are all too common. &quot;She may wander off for a bit to 
feed or drink. This is perfectly normal and is not abandonment. Unfortunately, 
when a human finds the baby animal, the human usually hangs around for long 
enough to deter the cow or doe from returning immediately, particularly if the 
fawn is touched or the area around it receives heavy human traffic.&quot;</p> 
<p>Prognosis is not always good for infants brought into captivity. While a 
few can be rehabilitated, many young animals will bond with human 
rehabilitators or other animals that are being rehabilitated. This bonding 
process generally makes it too dangerous to return the animals to the wild.</p> 
<p>&quot;If you find a baby animal, and you don't see any signs of the mother, 
contain your pets, and leave the baby animal alone where it is,&quot; said 
Division Wildlife Manager Perry Will, who dealt with two wildlife 
&quot;pickups&quot; last week.</p> 
<p>&quot;If you feel the animal is injured, in danger, or truly abandoned, the 
best thing you can do is mark the spot, then call the DOW,&quot; said Will. 
&quot;A wildlife officer can come out and check on the animal without 
endangering its chance for survival.&quot;</p> 
<p>Even if concerned citizens are certain that the young animal has been 
abandoned or the mother has been hit and killed by a car, it's still best to 
leave the baby alone and contact the DOW. Trained wildlife officers and 
licensed wildlife rehabilitators can collect the animal with the least possible 
impact.</p>

<p><b>Retired Arizona physician rescued on Coal Creek Trail </b></p> 
<p><b>By Gary Grazda</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>A 73-year-old Arizona man was rescued Friday, June 18, after seven hours 
alone in the forest with little water and no food.</p> 
<p>According to an Upper San Juan Search and Rescue news release, David Rhea, 
a retired physician from Tucson, was reported missing about 12:30 p.m. by his 
wife. He had become separated from her and two grandchildren while hiking the 
Coal Creek Trail near Fawn Gulch Road.</p> 
<p>Dick Cole, search and rescue supervising coordinator, said Rhea was wearing 
hiking shorts and a short-sleeved golf shirt. He had no food and very little 
water with him. Rhea also had no map, compass, GPS device or cell phone.</p> 
<p>Rhea was located about 7:45 p.m. above the switchbacks well into the trail 
after ground search crews noticed footprints of a lone individual traveling 
deeper into the forest. He was escorted to safety.</p> 
<p>Both Cole and Archuleta County Sheriff Tom Richards urged people who go 
into the wilderness to take maps, compasses or a GPS device. Cole added that 
people should not count on being able to use a cell phone because coverage is 
limited in the wilderness.</p> 
<p></p> <b>Letters</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Pagosa's blessing</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>This letter is in response to the letter of June 10 from Richard Brown of 
Albuquerque, &quot;Wolf Creek defense.&quot;</p> 
<p>We have many &quot;visitors&quot; to our area but, unfortunately, not all 
of them have this area's best intentions at heart. Economics, schmeconomics. 
One does not have to take an economics course to know the reality of living and 
working here.</p> 
<p>Just as one does not have to be a tree-hugging environmentalist to 
appreciate the beauty here, or know that if we do not help preserve our 
beautiful place, there will only be another big city with too many buildings, 
asphalt, pollution, and times when one cannot burn in one's fireplace for heat. 
To live here is a true blessing, and it is a challenge, but that is okay for 
most of us. We have the freedom to roam the countryside, on public lands. It is 
this public land that keeps us immune from the cult of economics that destroys 
wildlands and eviscerates rural landscapes in other places.</p> 
<p>The reality is salaries will still be low and not all the people who want 
to work will be able to work &quot;up there.&quot; Who do you think will be 
able to get jobs &quot;up there?&quot; How will that benefit our townspeople? 
According to the development's plans, they want to be a city unto themselves; 
why would the visitors or residents &quot;up there&quot; want to come down here?
</p> 
<p>At least, not to the extent you presume will help business and salaries. 
Property values are already so high, why the heck would we want them to get 
higher?</p> 
<p>As to the &quot;Texas issue,&quot; it's not so much that they are Texans, 
it's the attitude some bring with them, and this holds true for anyone from 
anywhere. The attitude they bring is to make things like they are in Wherever, 
USA; they would not want us to come there and impose our ideas on them.</p> 
<p>Pagosa is Pagosa, with all its quaintness, its beautiful scenery, its 
challenges and its way of doing things. The problem may lie not in losing their 
business because of the &quot;Texas issue,&quot; but in them deciding they like 
it &quot;up here&quot; better! They may also decide to buy condos &quot;up 
there&quot; instead of down here. So, it seems to me, it would take away from 
our business and salaries, not increase or benefit them.</p> 
<p>I'm a respiratory therapist and know the high altitude &quot;up there&quot; 
will cause numerous problems to the flatlanders. So, where will they go for 
medical help? Most likely to the nearest hospital, either in Del Norte or 
Alamosa. How does this help us?</p> 
<p>When the tide comes up, the boats may rise, but sometimes it also floods. 
And sometimes floods can be devastating to the boats, the people and to nature. 
In this case, the tide may float a few boats, but for the most part, it would 
be devastating to our little section of nature &amp;emdash; while devastating 
part of the real wealth of Pagosa.</p>

<p><b>Gives resignation</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I regretfully offer my resignation to this board (health services district) 
&amp;emdash; I believe I am letting down the thousands who voted for me twice 
by doing so, as those are the folks I represent.</p> 
<p>I believe it is sad that special interests that indeed are &quot;conflicts 
of interest&quot; are now in control of the district and that, instead of 
spending efforts on building you are spending time and effort on witch hunts to 
discredit good people.</p> 
<p>This is not due to any demands stated by you via the phone nor due to the 
threatening letters I have received, but rather a decision that I was making 
due to the treatment I was subjected to last night (June 15). Having served for 
six years under three different chairmen, I have never been treated so 
disrespectfully.</p> 
<p>I had hoped that the new board would want to include me in committee work, 
what with my past years of service and my first-hand experience from 12 years 
on the ambulance service; however, they have chosen to leave me out.</p>

<p><b>Wooden card catalog slated for silent auction</b></p> 
<p><b>By Lenore Bright</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist </b></p> 
<p>Our wooden card catalog has not been in use for many years. There will not 
be room for it when we enclose the new children's area.</p> 
<p>So many people have shown interest in purchasing the piece of furniture, we 
are going to have a &quot;silent auction&quot; starting next week.</p> 
<p>If you are interested, bring your bid in a dated, sealed envelope along 
with your name, address and phone number. We will open the bids by the end of 
July.</p> 
<p>The winner must remove the catalog from the library premises by a certain 
date, yet to be determined.</p> 
<p>For more information, call 264-2209.</p> 
<p><b>Building project update</b></p> 
<p>Final plans should be in this week from the architect, Dennis Humphries and 
the contractor, Colorado Jaynes.</p> 
<p>Groundbreaking could be scheduled very soon. We are in the 
&quot;permit&quot; stage at present.</p> 
<p>As soon as we know actual costs, we can begin our final fund-raising drive.
</p> 
<p><b>Writing in books</b></p> 
<p>It is considered a sin to write in library books.</p> 
<p>Every once in a while, some unthinking patrons will take it upon themselves 
to offer editorial thoughts about the content of a book. We discourage this and 
often have to discard the material.</p> 
<p>However, we have received a donation of a gem of a travel guide, annotated 
with the best places to go in New Orleans. It is filled with personal comments 
on post-it notes that have great suggestions of what one should do while there.
</p> 
<p>While we can't put it in our collection with these notes, we will consider 
typing up the notes and sharing them with anyone interested in going there. 
Once the notes are out, we will catalog the travel guide - it is an Eyewitness 
Guide that shows what others only tell you.</p> 
<p>If you're interested, let me know.</p> 
<p><b>New books</b></p>

her passion for making miniatures with her writing skills. She writes for 
Dolls' House World magazine and lives in England.</p> 
<p>&quot;Spirit Walker - Poems by Nancy Wood, and Paintings by Frank 
Howell,&quot; speaks eloquently of the courage, determination and powerful 
spiritual faith of Native Americans. The poems reveal the unique wisdom and 
vision of a people. Howell's paintings evoke the beauty and vitality of the 
ancient culture. It is an inspirational collection of art and poetry.</p> 
<p><b>Summer reading </b></p>

<p><b>Join the Patriotic Sing-Along</b></p> 
<p><b>to kick off July 4 celebration </b></p> 
<p><b>By Sally Hamiester</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The communitywide prelude to our local July 4 celebrations will take place 
next Tuesday evening, June 29, at the community center, and you are all invited 
to join us at the first-ever Patriotic Sing-Along beginning at 7 p.m.</p> 
<p>This program is free to the public, and free flags provided by the Chamber 
of Commerce and the community center will be given to all who attend.</p> 
<p>In addition to local talent, a visiting youth choir, Testament, will sing 
several patriotic medleys. This high school group of 30 is from the First 
United Methodist Church in Arlington, Texas, and will be here in Pagosa as a 
part of their summer tour. Last year this group traveled to Washington, D.C. 
where they were featured in a concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial 
under the direction of Paul Arrendell, son of the local resident Beverly 
Arrendell.</p> 
<p>Also included in this program will be the Parade of Colors by local 
veterans as well as Pagosa musicians John Graves, Father John Bowe, a 
barbershop quartet from the senior center and a ladies trio. Following the 
program, please plan to stay and enjoy a pot luck dessert and drinks provided 
by the community center.</p> 
<p>Mercy Korsgren, community center director, is delighted to organize this 
communitywide gathering to celebrate our national heritage and is hopeful this 
will become an annual event in Pagosa.</p> 
<p><b>LPEA thanks</b></p> 
<p>Our sincere and heartfelt thanks go out once again to Mike Alley at LaPlata 
Electric for answering my plea to put up one of our Chamber flags again.</p> 
<p>Darin Rome with La Plata arrived with the cherry picker and put up the 
errant flag, and I thank Darin for his efforts. The folks at La Plata Electric 
have been helping us for years now with these blasted flags of ours with never 
a word of complaint, and I want to thank them for being such incredibly good 
and generous friends.</p> 
<p><b>New director</b></p> 
<p>You may or may not be aware that Nan Rowe recently resigned her position as 
a Chamber of Commerce board director to pursue interests in the political arena.
</p> 
<p>We are grateful to Nan for the two and a half years she served on this 
board and wish her well in her new endeavors.</p> 
<p>The board determined that we needed a &quot;seasoned&quot; director to fill 
Nan's vacancy since we all concurred that it takes about a year to absorb and 
assimilate all the Chamber &quot;stuff.&quot;</p> 
<p>We are simply delighted to announce that Don McKeehan of Old West Press 
agreed to come on board for the next six months. Don and Mary McKeehan have 
individually served a number of years on this board as both directors and 
president and have collectively supported virtually every Chamber event from 
the beginning of time. The McKeehans can be counted upon to arrive early and 
leave late for every function to lend a helping hand and were honored a couple 
of years ago as Citizens of the Year for their remarkable contributions to this 
community through their participation in just about everything that happens in 
Pagosa. We sincerely welcome Don back to our board and applaud him for agreeing 
to join this motley crew for the next six months.</p> 
<p><b>Rotary holiday parade</b></p> 
<p>Don't forget to pick up your entry form for the July 4 parade sponsored as 
always by our Pagosa Springs Rotary Club with great prizes awarded to winners 
in categories that include commercial, nonprofit and service groups, 
individuals and families, youth groups and musical. I'm sure you can easily fit 
into one of those categories and stand to win some dough if your group wins.</p>
<p>The parade will be held Saturday, July 3, beginning at 10 a.m. with line-up 
assignments, late registration and any final decorating taking place in the 
high school parking lot beginning at 9 a.m. and the parade will begin promptly 
at 10 a.m. with entry onto U.S. 160 from 8th Street.</p> 
<p>Rotary respectfully requests that water guns and air horns stay at home and 
that parade participants not throw candy or anything at all from the floats.</p>
<p>We'll be talking more about July 4 events in the future, but keep in mind 
that there will be days of celebration for you to enjoy with family and friends.
</p> 
<p>The Park to Park Arts and Crafts Festival will take place on July 2, 3 and 
4 along with the Red Ryder Rodeo and the 2004 Quilt Fest to be held in the

concert and fireworks will be held at the sports complex downtown this year 
Sunday, July 4, with lots of related activities and events. </p> 
<p>We are thrilled to announce that the Pagosa Hot Strings will once again 
grace us with their presence and music at the concert Sunday beginning at 7

join us every year for as long as they are willing to, so we are always

anyone. Please come and help drown out my terrible voice and join in with our 
community.</p> 
<p>We veterans can lead the community in patriotic spirit and show support for 
our country, and honor all those who serve in our military today.</p>

19th century. The legs, made from Pennsylvania hard maple, are stabilized at 
the base by gracefully curved stretchers joined at their centers by a ball and 
block mechanism. This design provides high strength in a delicate and light 
form suitable for exhibiting jewelry.</p> 
<p>Bird's eye maple and period drawer pulls accent the curved drawer front. 
Raised moulding around the drawer front adds depth and interesting shading in 
low angle light. Three halogen lights illuminate a framed glass lid, which 
opens for easy access to jewelry. The six-step finishing process, gives the 
piece an &quot;aged&quot; appearance fitting its traditional design.</p>

the arts - weaving stories, songs, painting, rugs, and their lives together.

<p><b>Crab Nebula Supernova's birth lighted Chimney Rock</b></p> 
<p><b>By John Graves</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>An explosion in the sky on the Fourth of July? Pretty routine. Except this 
ball of fire appeared in the sky over Chimney Rock and the Four Corners area in 
the year 1054 A.D.</p> 
<p>Remaining for three weeks as a large star visible even in the day and 
shining as brightly as the full moon at night, it gradually faded away and 
vanished - but not before the world had seen and recorded this amazing 
apparition, now recognized as the birth of the Crab Nebula Supernova.</p> 
<p>A supernova is the most violent way a star can die, and in this case its 
aftermath was the creation of the Crab Nebula. (A nebula is briefly defined as 
any of many vast cloud-like masses of gas or dust among the stars.)</p> 
<p>Just what, exactly, is a supernova? Well, to define it &quot;exactly&quot; 
would probably take a science degree and several thousand words, but following 
are a few assorted facts relating to this phenomenon.</p> 
<p>Eleven million years ago, in the constellation of Taurus the Bull (where 
the Crab Nebula is now), a star was born. It was much larger than the sun and 
about 6,300 light years from Earth. Following millions of turbulent years and 
many successive violent transformations, it exploded. This was 7,247 years ago. 
The light from this cataclysmic event reached Earth 6,300 years later, on the 
aforementioned Fourth of July in 1054 A.D. (If you prefer to consider the 
distance from the explosion to Earth in actual miles, the figure is 40 
quintillion.)</p> 
<p>A star is essentially a gigantic hydrogen bomb - a fusion explosion 
converting hydrogen to helium and heavier elements, releasing enormous amounts 
of energy in the process. It is constantly attempting to maintain a balance 
between two titanic forces: the immense gravity of its mass, which is trying to 
compress and crush it, and the gigantic outward pressure of the nuclear fusion 
at the core, which is trying to blow it apart.</p> 
<p>As long as these two forces are in balance, the star neither expands nor 
collapses, and thus remains stable. But nothing stays the same forever. Hence 
the supernova.</p> 
<p>Imagine how profound an experience it would be for even an amateur 
astronomer to discover a new star in the sky. Then consider how it must have 
impacted Ancestral Puebloans, whose very life, religion and culture were 
dominated by perceptions of the positions and movements of celestial bodies.</p>
<p>These early Four Corners inhabitants left images that may represent this 
new star.</p> 
<p>At Penasco Blanco in Chaco Canyon, N.M., a pictograph of a crescent moon 
and star is thought to represent the supernova. The handprint is thought to 
mark a sacred site according to the Pueblo tradition.</p> 
<p>And, at Chimney Rock, they may have constructed one wall of the Great House 
to align with this event.</p> 
<p>Another point to ponder: observers in Chaco Canyon saw the star in their 
northern sky, where it would appear to lead to Chimney Rock.</p> 
<p>The creation of the Crab Nebula was one of several events in the sky over 
and around Chimney Rock in the years 900 to 1200 A.D. Did they influence the 
settlement and importance of the site? We'll probably never know.</p> 
<p>What we do know is that The Chimney Rock Interpretive Program will hold a 
series of special programs to illuminate and celebrate such events.</p> 
<p>On the Fourth of July there will be a special Supernova Sunrise program 
marking the 950th anniversary of the appearance of the Crab Nebula Supernova. 
During this program Glenn Raby, Chimney Rock site manager, will describe 
supernovas, the northern lunar standstill, and other astronomical events as 
they relate to Chimney Rock. Also, the archaeoastronomy of Chimney Rock will be 
explored.</p> 
<p><b>Northern lunar standstill</b></p> 
<p>The moon stands still? Well, it's actually more of a turnaround. In a 
journey of 18.61 years, the moon travels the horizon from south to north, 
pauses for several years, then returns to the southern end of the cycle. 
(There's a &quot;wobble&quot; in the plane of the moon's elliptical orbit, 
which causes this irregular path.)</p> 
<p>The rising of the moon in its progressive phases between the rock spires of 
Chimney Rock was probably of profound significance to its early Ancestral 
Puebloan residents.</p> 
<p>The unfolding events of this returning lunar cycle will be the object of a 
series of public lectures and observations beginning in late 2004 through 2008. 
Watch the paper and the Chimney Rock Web site (www.chimneyrockco.org) for 
specific dates and times.</p> 
<p><b>Calendar of events</b></p> 
<p>Mark your calendar and join us for one or several of our special events 
this summer.</p> 
<p>July will present two full moons and two full moon programs at Chimney 
Rock. (The second full moon occurring in any month is called the &quot;blue 
moon,&quot; thus the expression &quot;Once in a blue moon.&quot;) In addition 
there is continuing parade of programs planned from now until 2008 exploring 
the phenomenon of the northern lunar standstill as it impacts sightings at 
Chimney Rock.</p> 
<p>Full moon programs at Chimney Rock begin near dusk, as you walk up to the 
Great House Pueblo. The two-hour program begins as the sun goes down.</p> 
<p>You will journey back in time to when Ancient Puebloans occupied the area 
around Chimney Rock. Theories, legends and archaeological findings, as well as 
archaeoastronomy insights, are presented. After the full moon has risen, you 
will descend in its light, aided by our volunteer light brigade.</p> 
<p>- Friday, July 2 - Full moon program. Gates open 7-7:30 p.m. Program begins 
at 8. Full moon rises at 9:27. Tickets are $10</p>

<p>- Thursday, Sept. 23 - Fall equinox program.</p> 
<p>This is a sunrise program. The fall equinox is that point of time half way 
between the summer and winter solstices. There are many indications the Ancient 
Puebloans marked the passage of time with a solar calendaring system. Join us 
to learn how these solar events were observed at Chimney Rock Archaeological 
Area.</p> 
<p>Gate opens 5:50-6 a.m. Program starts at 6:30. Sunrise is at 6:57. Tickets 
are $10</p> 
<p>- Tuesday, Sept. 28 - Full moon rise program - harvest moon</p> 
<p>Why does the harvest moon appear larger and different in color from other 
full moons? Join us to find out these facts and more as Chimney Rock 
Interpretive Association presents a full moon rise program.</p> 
<p>Gates Open 5:15-5:45 p.m. Program starts at 6:15. Moon rise is 7:15. 
Tickets are $10</p> 
<p>- Monday, Oct. 4 - Moon rise preview.</p> 
<p>The moon will begin to be visible between the rocks. This is a preview of 
what is to come over the next four years. Only part of the moon is expected to 
be seen at this viewing. Space is limited and the event will be canceled if bad 
weather prohibits a safe climb to the Great House Pueblo at the top of Chimney 
Rock Archaeological Area to view the moonrise. Please note the time of the 
event.</p>

herself in giving each student individual attention. There will be a gentle, 
yet informative critique at the end of each day.</p> 
<p>&quot;I've always felt a responsibility to share as an artist. Through 
exhibiting my work as well as teaching, I can share the lessons I have learned 
with others who are eager to experience the creative challenge,&quot; Moon said.
</p> 
<p>She is a member of the National Watercolor Society and a signature member 
of both the Mississippi Watercolor Society and the Wisconsin Watercolor 
Society. Moon teaches watercolor workshops all over the U.S. as well as in 
other countries.</p> 
<p>Space is limited. Sign up now for Unleashing the Power of Watercolor, July 
5, 6, 7 and 8 at the Pagosa Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>Cost is $190 for PSAC members and $200 for nonmembers. Contact PSAC at 
264-5020 or e-mail psac@centurytel.net.</p> 
<p>Joye Moon's one woman exhibit at the gallery in Town Park opens July 1 with 
a reception for the artist from 5-7 p.m.</p> 
<p>Moon is providing Wisconsin cheese and wine for the celebration. The 
exhibit consists of recent artwork created especially for the council. She used 
this opportunity to explore incorporating collage and drawing techniques with 
her paintings.</p> 
<p>The subject of her work varies from realistic and abstract landscapes to 
placing the figure in an environment. Moon will also feature work painted on 
location in France and Italy.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Craft fest booth features Chimney Rock </b></p> 
<p>Learn more about it! The Chimney Rock Archeological Area will sponsor an 
educational booth July 2-4 at the Pagosa Springs Arts and Crafts Festival, in 
Town Park.</p> 
<p>Information about the ancestral Puebloan site will be available. The 
program is run by local volunteers in partnership with the Forest Service.</p> 
<p>Ancestral Puebloans occupied this area approximately a thousand years ago. 
The site has been declared a Chacoan &quot;outlier.&quot; An intriguing area, 
the site has been excavated by several archeologists, beginning in the 1920s.
</p> 
<p>Why did these people settle here? How did they live on such a high 
pinnacle? What caused them to leave? Was this a spiritual site? An astronomical 
one?</p> 
<p>Various theories are presented to visitors on tours of the site. Stop by 
our booth and learn more about Chimney Rock, its programs and volunteer 
opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Open Mic helps teens overcome phobias</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karen Carpenter </b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Last Friday's Open Mic was a collage of sounds and an excellent way to get 
over any microphone phobia one might have.</p> 
<p>The teens explored different sound and musical venues from keyboard 
accompaniment to jokes and even sound effects. Open Mic will continue at 6 p.m. 
Fridays. So bring your instruments, voice and comedy routines for the fun of it.
</p> 
<p>Our numbers are down this summer as schedules fill up with outdoor and 
family activities, but many visitors and new residents have come to join us and 
it is always a pleasure to welcome them.</p> 
<p>Air conditioning on hot afternoons makes the Teen Center a welcome refuge 
from the heat. If you would like to play games, chill with friends or shoot 
hoops, come join us. We have spontaneous tournaments daily. We are open from 
1-8 p.m. weekdays.</p> 
<p>Latarah Rivera, 13, won the Teen Center Logo contest. Her logo was a C over 
T overlay in bright color shading. Patrick Manzanares was runner-up.</p> 
<p>The advisory board will meet 5:30 p.m. Thursday, July 1.</p> 
<p>I would like to thank the Flying Burrito for its donation of meal gift 
certificates to the Teen Center. We hold contests every week and these prizes 
are invaluable.</p> 
<p>I am looking for a volunteer to teach/spot wrestling. If you are able to

<p><b>Auditions set for youth roles in 'Peter and the Wolf' </b></p> 
<p><b>By Carole Howard</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Auditions will take place in the high school choir room 6-8 p.m. Monday, 
June 28, for boys and girls 10-12 who would like to play one of the eight to 
ten characters in &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; next month. Rehearsals will 
start July 12.</p> 
<p>The performance will be the highlight when Music in the Mountains hosts a 
free outdoor community concert called Family Festivo for children of all ages 
in Town Park 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Thursday, July 29.</p> 
<p>Felicia Meyer and Melinda Baum are in charge of the open audition for the 
parts in &quot;Peter,&quot; a musical work created by Russian composer Sergei 
Prokofiev to teach his children about the symphony. They explained that the 
Pagosa Children's Theatre audition will have two parts:</p> 
<p>First, aspiring young actors are asked to choose their favorite animal and 
be prepared to act as that animal without sound for one minute. For example, 
you might want to show your animal swimming, flying, lying down, getting up, 
eating, chewing, pouncing or crawling.</p> 
<p>Second, entrants will be asked to spontaneously pantomime a role chosen 
from &quot;Peter&quot; with the music playing. So you will want to be familiar 
with the characters and the basic story.</p> 
<p><b>The story</b></p> 
<p>Peter is a little boy (a girl or boy may play this part) who lives in 
Russia on the edges of a meadow with his grandfather. Beyond the meadow is a 
deep, dark forest. Peter's grandfather has warned him not to go into the meadow 
alone because it is dangerous. But Peter's curiosity gets the better of him and 
he ventures out into the meadow.</p> 
<p>In the meadow, Peter meets the bird and the duck. The bird flies around the 
pond where the duck swims, and they argue who is better - the one who can fly 
or the one who can swim. Then a cat slinks into the meadow, preying upon the 
bird. Peter calls out to the bird, warning it, and it flies into a tall tree 
for safety.</p> 
<p>Grandfather comes out of the house and is very angry when he sees Peter in 
the meadow. He warns Peter about the wolf. Peter tells his grandfather that he 
is not afraid of wolves! Grandfather takes Peter home and a big gray wolf comes 
out of the forest. The cat springs up into the tree! The duck jumps out of the 
pond and the wolf chases the duck! The wolf catches the duck and swallows it in 
a single gulp!</p> 
<p>The wolf begins to circle the tree where the cat and bird sit. Peter 
arrives and he has an idea: He brings a rope and climbs along a branch into the 
tree. He tells the bird to distract the wolf. The bird cleverly taunts the 
wolf, who snaps furiously at the bird. Peter makes a lasso out of the rope and 
lets it down very carefully, catching the wolf by the tail. Then he pulls up 
the rope with all his might. The wolf jumps wildly to try to get loose. 
Meanwhile, hunters come out of the woods, shooting their guns as they approach.
</p> 
<p>What happens next? Well, we don't want to ruin the suspense, so we will 
keep the end of the story a secret until the performance on July 29.</p> 
<p><b>Other performers</b></p> 
<p>Also entertaining the audience at Family Festivo in Town Park will be local 
performers including Jana Burch's tap dancers, Jennifer Martin's gymnastics 
group and Stephanie Jones' San Juan Dance Academy. As well, there will be games 
for children and free food for all beginning at noon, after the entertainment.
</p> 
<p>&quot;We want everyone to enjoy the music and performances in a casual, 
picnic-like setting,&quot; said Lisa Scott, who is cochairing the Family 
Festivo activities along with Claudia Rosenbaum. &quot;We hope everyone will 
bring blankets and chairs and really have a fun time.&quot;</p> 
<p>Each character in &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; is represented by an 
instrument or instrumental family: Peter by the string instruments of the 
orchestra, the grandfather by bassoons, the bird by flutes, the duck by oboes, 
the cat by clarinets, the wolf by French horns, and the hunters by percussion 
instruments. To help the audience enjoy this experience even more, Mischa 
Semanitzky will demonstrate the various instruments. He is the originator and 
conductor of the Music in the Mountains symphony orchestra, 15 of whom will 
play for us at this concert.</p> 
<p>As well, chief librarian Lenore Bright will include &quot;Peter and the 
Wolf&quot; in the children's summer reading program.</p> 
<p>After the hour-long concert, hot dogs, chips, ice cream, lemonade and water 
will be served free, thanks to the generosity of Montezuma's Restaurant, The 
Springs, and Jim and Bonnie Van Bortel. As well, donations from the Bank of the 
San Juans, LPEA Roundup Foundation and the Town of Pagosa Springs are helping 
to fund the event.</p> 
<p>&quot;Many adults who now love classical music were first introduced to 
symphonies in their childhood when they attended a performance of 'Peter and 
the Wolf,' Scott said. &quot;We know everyone who comes will enjoy this concert 
and the characters in the story. We also hope they will be encouraged to learn 
more about great music and the many instruments that bring it to life.</p> 
<p>&quot;I also want to stress that 'Peter' is a delightful orchestral work 
that adults will enjoy as well,&quot; Scott said, &quot;so this is a concert 
for children of all ages.&quot;</p> 
<p>This is the third consecutive summer that Music in the Mountains will offer 
musical events here in Pagosa, and the first time we have had a free outdoor 
concert for the community. It is a companion to the ever-popular Family Festivo 
event that has been held for several years in Durango.</p>

<p><b>'The Hills Are Alive ...' focuses </b></p> 
<p><b>on America's developing culture</b></p> 
<p><b>By John Graves</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>&quot;The Hills Are Alive &#138;,&quot; the Pagosa Springs Music Boosters' 
original musical revue to be presented July 8-10, offers a rare opportunity for 
families to experience a half century of America's unique culture, as expressed 
through its show music written by composer Richard Rodgers.</p> 
<p>From the early '20s to the late '70s, the songs of Rodgers, with the lyrics 
of Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, not only reflected the societal and 
musical mores of these decades, they also affected transformations of the 
entire art form.</p> 
<p>Beginning with &quot;Garrick Gaieties&quot; in 1925 (originally a benefit 
show for the Theater Guild, which was so successful it had two Broadway runs), 
Rodgers and Hart's material ranged from silly satire to the poignant but daring 
social commentary of &quot;Pal Joey,&quot; with some of the most beautiful love 
songs in all musical literature gracing each and every production.</p> 
<p>Incidentally, two of their songs were banned from the radio, for the sake 
of &quot;common decency.&quot; One, called &quot;Dancing On the Ceiling,&quot; 
suggested that the singer imagined his or her lover was dancing every evening 
on his or her ceiling. &quot;The Girl Friend,&quot; (which is included in 
&quot;The Hills Are Alive...&quot;) used the word &quot;hell&quot; once as a 
&quot;throwaway&quot; expletive. (Parental discretion is advised).</p> 
<p>&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; written with Oscar Hammerstein II, ushered in a whole 
new musical era, wherein the songs and dances of the '50s, '60s and '70s were 
an integral part of the unfolding drama (as in grand opera, but without the 
ubiquitous obesity of the sopranos and tenors), rather than merely stand-alone 
vehicles for talented performers.</p> 
<p>In addition to the unforgettable music, comedy, dancing and drama of such 
musicals as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; &quot;Carousel,&quot; &quot;The King and 
I,&quot; &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; each 
production from this team had the courage to include subtle implications of 
such controversial subjects as race prejudice, spousal abuse, and intolerance - 
reflecting social concerns of these decades.</p> 
<p>Performances of this full-scale musical production (with a cast of over 50 
singers, dancers, and musicians) start at 7:30 p.m. in the Pagosa Springs High 
School Auditorium. Reserved seat tickets may be purchased at the Plaid Pony, 
731-5262. Prices are $12 for adults, $10 for seniors, and $6 for children.</p>

<p><b>Quilt Fest's educational segment aimed at youth</b></p> 
<p><b>By Shari Pierce and Robbye Reedy</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Each year at Quilt Fest, the Pagosa Piecemakers include an educational 
component to the show. This area of the show is directed toward children; 
however, adults often find this section of the show very enjoyable too.</p> 
<p>Such will be the case this again this year. Robbye Reedy, educational booth 
director, has worked with her friends and fellow quilters to design an exciting 
experience for us all.</p> 
<p>Do you know the components of a quilt? Have you seen the underside of a 
pieced quilt top before it is sandwiched with batting and backing and quilted? 
Then you will surely want to visit the Education Corner at Pagosa Quilt Fest 
2004. Adults, teens, and children are welcome to sit and &quot;play&quot; with 
the quilt activities that teach about the art and craft of quilting.</p> 
<p>We know the regular school year has ended. But visit our Old Times 
Schoolroom where you will have fun while you test your knowledge or just 
assemble a puzzle or organize a &quot;pretend quilt.&quot; Lending authenticity 
to this schoolroom are antique school desks with some old school items your 
grandpa might remember. One or two of our students are real &quot;dummies&quot; 
but their costumes are pretty neat! You will move to the head of the class when 
you try out our trivia quiz, preview our library display, make a pretend quilt, 
or study a little quilt history.</p> 
<p>Our schoolroom is an exceptional backdrop for some exceptional quilts. The 
centerpiece of our bulletin board is a patriotic wall hanging of beautifully 
hand-quilted &quot;Redwork.&quot;</p> 
<p>Try our quilting trivia displayed here. Can we stump you? Do you see 
geometry or symbolism in some antique quilts? Did you know that early American 
quilters often expressed their superstitious nature within their quilts? We 
will give you some clues in this area.</p> 
<p>Our vocabulary lesson will test your knowledge of quilting terms. Don't 
worry. Everyone will pass this test. Did you know that pieced designs or 
&quot;blocks&quot; often have names? See examples of the &quot;Colorado 
Block&quot; on display. Did you know that pioneer women stitched quilt blocks 
as they walked hundreds of miles to their new homes in the West? Some were the 
pioneer settlers in our state.</p> 
<p>The schoolroom library includes interesting books for all age and interest 
levels in which quilting is the central theme. Browse through our collection. 
Take note of Web sites offering further information. Learn how quilters have 
embraced technology. Cultural heritage can be expressed in unique quilting 
techniques, choice of colors, and designs. Visitors, especially the children, 
can experiment with color and design to make a &quot;pretend&quot; quilt at a 
table adjacent to the Old Times Schoolroom. Or, perhaps you will advance to the 
head of the class as you try to assemble a heritage quilt block puzzle.</p> 
<p>Next, you may want to take a closer peek at the quilt top displayed on the 
back wall of our schoolroom. You will be able to view the hand stitching that 
connects the pieces that make a block. You will see what a quilt top looks like 
before the batting, backing, and binding are added. And it is here that we step 
back in time and examine the impact quilts have as silent messengers.</p> 
<p>Our social studies lesson entitled &quot;Heritage Through Oral 
Tradition&quot; hangs on the back wall in our schoolroom. We are honored to 
display a quilt top which was hand -pieced with a purpose more than 150 years 
ago. It is on loan to us from Ms. Dorothy Van Antwerp of Rio Rancho, N.M. The 
oral history of this family heirloom, as interpreted by Ms. Van Antwerp, begins 
in the 1850s in Louisiana. Ms. Van Antwerp's great-grandmother, Adelia DeHart, 
hurriedly prepared the quilt top by hand to hang outside her family's farmhouse 
identifying it as a safe house on the Underground Railroad.</p> 
<p>This quilt top may have been placed over the clothesline or fence with the 
lighter colored road squares pattern pointing north to the next station on the 
journey to freedom. Later, when the family moved to Texas the quilt top was 
packed away and Mrs. DeHart died before she could, if she ever intended to, 
complete it. In 1924 family members brought it in a covered wagon to Portales, 
N.M.</p> 
<p>In more recent years Ms. Van Antwerp, a history teacher and quilter, 
rescued it. She discovered the important story about it by interviewing elder 
family members. Her interest was piqued, so she researched the history of the 
era of this quilt top. Next, she wove the research and the quilt story into 
history lessons for her students. Don't miss viewing this exceptional piece of 
history and the fun activities at the Education Booth - Old Time School Room at 
Quilt Fest 2004.</p> 
<p>In addition to the Education Booth, visitors will have a chance to vote for 
their favorite among the quilts entered in the Pieces of America Challenge 
issued to guild members. There will be antique sewing machines, irons, an 
ironing board and a quilt rack that is over 100 years more. There will also be 
quilts, quilts and more quilts. From wall hangings, to antiques, to large 
quilts, there will be an enticing variety to see.</p> 
<p>Quilt Fest 2004 will be held July 2, 3 and 4 in the Mamie Lynch Gymnasium 
at the corner of Lewis and 4th streets. On July 3 and 4 the show will be open 
from 11 a.m.-7 p.m. and on July 4 it will be open from 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Entrance 
to the show will be via the doors on Fourth Street. Admission to the show is $2 
for adults and $1 for youth ages 10-18. Children 9 and under will be admitted 
at no charge. A multiple entry pass will be available for an additional $1. 
Please include a visit to Quilt Fest in your holiday plans. The Pagosa 
Piecemakers Quilt Guild sponsors quilt Fest 2004.</p>

<p><b>Lee Sterling Chile Taste competition is Aug. 5 </b></p> 
<p><b>By Jim Super</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>I had never tasted authentic Mexican food until moving to the Southwest 25 
years ago.</p> 
<p>The closest I got to chile was my mother's version with beans, meat and 
sauce. Although it was tasty, it was anything but true chile. My first 
experience came in Tucson, Ariz. At a restaurant that had been there for over a 
quarter of a century. I ordered chile con carne, and my palate was greeted by 
new tastes such as cilantro, cumin and, of course, the principal of this dish, 
red chile. I fell in love with it.</p> 
<p>Recently I was dining in one of my favorite haunts. Sitting down to eat I 
was greeted by the owner.</p> 
<p>She sat down and we embarked on conversation. Somehow, we got onto the 
subject of red and green chile. She told me a true story about her experience 
as a new restaurateur 14 years ago. The story goes that two new customers came 
in, Lucy and Mel Martinez. The couple both ordered chile, one red and one 
green. After the meal, Mrs. Martinez asked the owner where she learned to make 
chile. She responded, &quot;In New York.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; responded Mrs. Martinez. &quot;&quot;I will be in at 6 
a.m. to show you how to really make chile, honey.&quot; To this day she uses 
these recipes for red and green chile, fondly known as &quot;Lucy's Chile&quot; 
She stated with all honesty, &quot;I'm from Long Island. What did I know about 
chile?&quot;</p> 
<p>Her words ring true for all of us who want to make a great chile. You have 
to learn from a master at the art of chile making. It takes technique and know 
how with this delicious dish, from the fiery hot variety for the more daring 
souls or mild for the meeker taste buds. Many people have that special recipe 
of their own for chile, so the challenge is to prove that your recipe is the 
best by entering the second annual Lee Sterling Chile Taste Thursday, Aug. 5.
</p> 
<p>The categories for chile this year will be red, green and a special open 
category. The open category will be for variations on the theme such as 
vegetarian and the many diversions from the standards such as Texas or 
Cincinnati chili, to name a few.</p> 
<p>The chile's at the contest will be judged for the best in the hot ,mild and 
open category. There will also be the &quot;People's Choice Award&quot; where 
the patrons of the event can judge who is the best.</p> 
<p>Great detail in planning for this year's event will create the feeling of 
old Mexico. The food tent will be beautifully decorated to enhance the dining 
experience. A strolling mariachi will serenade diners as they feast on an 
unlimited array of chili. The Spanish Fiesta royalty will grace us with their 
presence as our servers for the evening. Vendors will also be present from 
various restaurants in town to offer items from their menu.</p> 
<p>The Lee Sterling Chile Taste is open to all who want to compete in this 
year's contest, but is limited to only 50 entries. Entry forms must be received 
no later than Aug. 2.</p> 
<p>Calling all our great cooks to not delay, you may be the new winner of the 
red, green, or in between category. If you do win, you can say that you make 
the best chile in town and have a prize to prove it!</p> 
<p>Please contact the contest officiator, Kim Moore, at 731-0426 for complete 
details and event times. Best of luck to all entries of the chile festival.</p>

<p></p> <b>Food for Thought</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Fire up the grill; no Wheat Kings shirts this Father's Day</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Father's Day is just around the corner.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Yep, Sunday.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Your ne'er-do-well daughters aren't going to get you anything. Again. 
You know that, don't you?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;So what? I don't expect anything. Moreover, I probably don't deserve 
anything. But, they nearly always call. Aurora even sends a card every other 
year or so.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;And that's enough for you?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;It's not right. You deserve better.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A lot of people think if I deserve anything, it's a sound 
thrashing.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;That's for sure, but you need a gift on Father's Day. You've been a 
good father, in your own peculiar way.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Dad of the Decade.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm going to get you a present.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;That's sweet, but I'm not your father.</p> 
<p>&quot;You're the father of my children.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;It didn't require that much effort, really.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I found something for you; I want you to check it out before I buy 
it.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;What is it.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Something you've needed for a long time.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Liposuction?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Well, true, you've needed that for a very long time. You could do 
with fewer chins. But no, not that.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Therapy?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Well, again, that's something that could be of great value, although 
it's a bit late in the game. But, no.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A Brandon Wheat Kings T-shirt?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I have no idea what that is, and &#138;&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A T-shirt commemorating what I consider to be the consistently best 
Junior A hockey program in all of Manitoba, though fans in Flin Flon would 
disagree in typically violent fashion. I'll give you a Web site address and you 
can order me the black shirt, with the stylized wheat sheaf, and the gray shirt 
with 'Property of Brandon Wheat Kings' emblazoned on the front. I'll wear them 
proudly at the gym when I lift heavy objects and put them back down again. 
Extra-large, please.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Get serious. I have a gift in mind that will fill a need as well as 
speak of love and gratitude on Father's Day, and I want you to go check it out 
before I buy it. Like now.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Now?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Yes, right now. It's on sale and there's only one left at the store. 
Put your pants on and get off the couch. Turn that TV off. You've seen this 
episode of Cheaters ten times if you've seen it once. You've got the dialogue 
memorized. I see you moving your lips. Up and at 'em, chunky.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;But Chauncey is having an affair with the gal at the drive-thru 
window and, for crying out loud, Taneesha just had twins. - little Chauncey Jr. 
and Chaunceen. There are poignant subtleties here. Look at Chauncey's body 
language. Look at Tasheen's tattoo, the permanent teardrop right at the corner 
of the eye. This is profoundly human stuff.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Up.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Where am I going?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;To look at a new gas grill.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A gas grill?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Yes. You need a new gas grill. I want to buy it and give it to you as 
your Father's Day present.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;First, I'm not sure I need a new gas grill. Second, have you saved 
the money?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;First, yes you need it. Second, I'll use a credit card. The one with 
your name on it.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A gas grill?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Look out on the deck. What do you see?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Besides the rotting boards and the section of deck that seems ready 
to collapse at any moment?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Look at that old grill. It's beyond being an embarrassment; it's a 
hazard to health and home. It's being used as a plant stand.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;True. That's why I haven't grilled for two years. Once the igniter 
went out I lost interest. I mean, to start it I had to take the racks out, then 
remove the shelf with the greasy lava rocks. Then I had to turn the gas on and 
reach down inside with a kitchen match to light the burner. And getting those 
racks back on after the burner was lighted, boy, that was a trick. I finally 
got tired of the explosions and the smell of burning hair.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Exactly. You need a new grill.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;But I don't like to grill that often.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;You will. A new grill will open culinary doors for you. You'll 
discover an enthusiasm you've forgotten. Plus, I'll buy you one of those cute 
aprons. Extra large.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Oh, I don't know. Isn't there something more important we could spend 
the money on? Like the full set of Girls Gone Wild DVDs or a roulette bet the 
next time we go to Vegas?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The apron will have a cute saying printed on it. Something like 'King 
of the Grill' or 'I be grillin' while you be chillin'. You'll look real cute 
and everyone will love the food and admire your skill.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Everyone?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Well, sure. I mean, what good is a grill unless you have a 
cookout?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A cookout?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;You bet. I've already got a list of people we need to invite. Do you 
realize how many people we owe? You promised Beth and John a dinner and conned 
Beth into making dinner for us. It's been two years and we haven't had them 
over yet. It's a disgrace. And Mike and Berkey. Do you realize how many times 
they've had us over and all you do is put off an invitation. You always have 
the flu or shingles or offer up some other phony excuse. How about Dorothy and 
Larry? They've had us over a couple of times for their Christmas open house. 
And Jack and Pattie? The gout excuse has lost its power; you have nowhere left 
to hide, big boy. What have we done? I'll tell you if you don't know: zip, 
zero, nada. We are social pariahs.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A cookout?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I figure we owe at least 20 people, to start. With your new grill, 
you can take that first, important step toward redeeming yourself. You can use 
the grill to help you become a semi-likable person. Think about this situation 
you've created: It's shameful, Karl. Absolutely shameful. This is your last 
chance to stop the train around before it jumps the tracks.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;So, you're ready to spend three hundred dollars to have a 
cookout?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Three hundred sixty-two dollars and thirty-two cents. Yes.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Where will we put the grill?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;On the deck, of course.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The deck is ready to collapse. Picture this: me, on the ground, on my 
back amidst the wreckage. On top of me is a large gas grill, burners still 
aflame. I am covered with grease and a load of overcooked burgers and 
bratwursts. The dog is leaping into the debris in a frantic search for 
sausages. Imagine a fireball. Imagine the smell of burning hair. I've got a lot 
of hair growing in a lot of places you know. It would be like torching a 
mattress.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll fix the deck.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;So we can have a place to put the new grill?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Exactly. And to have our cookout. Or cookouts. I'm buying a new patio 
table and chairs set to go along with the grill. What color chairs and umbrella 
do you prefer? There's teal, salmon, sunflower and buff.&quot;</p> 
<p>I look at the television screen. Taneesha is screaming at Chauncey as he 
runs across a dark parking lot, a camera crew in hot pursuit. Actually, I 
think, Chauncey doesn't have it all that bad. He is fleeing.</p> 
<p>&quot;So, this is a set-up so you can engineer your cookout.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;And your social rehabilitation, buster.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;And it's going to cost?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The grill is three-sixty and change. I got a bid on the deck and I 
think we can do it for about two grand. The table and chairs set, with colorful 
umbrella, is another four hundred. You'll need some grill utensils and I figure 
that's another thirty bucks. With tax, we're looking at a little over three 
thousand, Not bad, huh?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;What about the apron.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Oooh, yeah. Let's call it three grand, plus fifty or so bucks, 
firm.&quot;</p> 
<p>Taneesha is standing in the middle of the parking lot. She is sobbing, the 
left strap of her flimsy tank top falling off her pudgy shoulder. The 
compassionate host has his arm around the sobbing woman. An assistant holds the 
twins. Chauncey has scaled a tall cinder block wall and he is long gone.</p> 
<p>I look around. God speed, Chauncey; there is no escape for me. </p> 
<p>&quot;So get to it, chubby. Squeeze into those Dockers and take the truck 
to the store, check out the grill, tell them we'll take it. The table and 
chairs and umbrella are ready to bring home too.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I thought you wanted me to pick a color for the chairs and the 
umbrella.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;They're teal. The guys at the store will help you load things in the 
truck.&quot;</p> 
<p>I paid, they helped.</p> 
<p>When I got home I imposed on Charlie and his friend to help me heft the 
grill from truck to deck (that portion of the structure that might support the 
device). There it sits, a snazzy three-burner with porcelain-coated racks and a 
nifty little gas ring on the side that Charlie's friend calls a &quot;bean 
cooker.&quot; He lives near Corpus Christi so I don't mention any of the mother 
sauces I might brew there. We stand around for awhile, admiring the miracle of 
American engineering and the guys urge me to &quot;break it in and get the 
paint off the burners.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sound advice.</p> 
<p>It seems I am going to have to adjust my cooking style in order to produce 
the volume needed to justify the expense. It's not that I am averse to 
grilling, but I've grown very comfy with stovetop and oven work. It's going to 
be a tough habit to break.</p> 
<p>I refuse to succumb to mundane grill fare - burgers, dried-out steaks, etc. 
I am going to push this baby to its limits.</p> 
<p>The new grill has several manageable heat zones, so I will learn to work 
with them. I like grilled vegetables and there is no trick to them. I'll buy a 
rack to use when I grill fish, some skewers for prissy work. I'll prepare some 
herbal oils and bone up on my marinades. With the &quot;bean cooker&quot; I can 
amp up the fare considerably.</p> 
<p>What to produce on the test drive, on the eve of Father's Day? </p> 
<p>My youngest daughter Ivy is due in town and she's a fan of zippy eats. I 
decide to flash grill a nice hunk of flank steak along with some peppers - one 
red, one poblano - some white and green onions and a few spears of yellow 
squash. I'll warm flour tortillas in a foil pack, slice some avocados (unless 
the market is selling those window breakers that take three years to ripen) and 
tomato, chop some cilantro leaves, break out a melange of shredded cheeses and 
unleash the last of a batch of fine homemade salsa. There's several cold beers 
about. A bit of lime. Yes.</p> 
<p>The meat needs marinating so I decide on a simple blend: olive oil, lemon 
juice or red wine vinegar, thyme, bay leaf, salt, pepper, a measure of ground 
red chile, sliced onion. The meat and marinade go into the fridge for five or 
six hours prior to hitting the grill.</p> 
<p>This is a simple process: The veggies get grilled, each timed according to 
its needs, then get plopped on the upper rack over low heat, next to the 
tortillas. The flank steak goes over a burner turned to Thermonuclear on the 
dial, each side getting only a couple minutes time over the heat. Then, the 
slab is off the grill and on to a plate on the side wing of the grill to rest a 
few minutes. The peppers are sliced, the white onion is sliced. The meat is cut 
in thin pieces, against the grain. It's wrappin' time.</p> 
<p>Everything should be wonderful, if I remember to get the propane tank 
filled.</p> 
<p>Happy Father's Day.</p> 
<p>Oh, incidentally, if I owe you a meal, don't hold your breath waiting for 
the invitation.</p> 
<p>I be grillin' while you be chillin'.</p>

<p></p> <b>Cruising with Cruse</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>No backcountry hiker should go unprepared</b></p> 
<p><b>By Katherine Cruse</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Last week someone strayed from the Fourmile Creek Trail and got lost in the 
woods.</p> 
<p>He carried food and water. He had no camping equipment, no GPS, no compass. 
He was wearing shorts and a fleece top. He ended up spending the night up 
there, before Search and Rescue found him the next day.</p> 
<p>He's okay.</p> 
<p>He's darn lucky.</p> 
<p>I've been hiking alone this summer. Here's what I carry in a daypack on my 
back.</p> 
<p>Food and water. Besides a normal lunch I throw in a couple of granola-type 
bars and candy, and I carry two bottles of water.</p> 
<p>A first aid kit that includes a Mylar space blanket and an ace bandage, 
bandages and tape and antibiotic ointment. My kit also has iodine tablets for 
water purification.</p> 
<p>Maps and a compass and a trail guide if it exists.</p> 
<p>A knife and flashlight and an extra bit of rope. A lighter and a piece of 
firestarter.</p> 
<p>Rain gear, jacket and pants, no matter how bright and clear the sky is when 
I set out. Because here in the mountains you never know when a storm might come 
up. Even in June. Besides, they can double as windbreakers.</p> 
<p>An extra fleece shirt.</p> 
<p>I've contemplated adding a whistle, to blow if I think there's anyone in 
the area. But so far I've stayed on the trails, where people are likely to find 
me.</p> 
<p>You might think this is a lot to carry, but trust me, if something went 
wrong and you had to spend the night, you'd want to be prepared.</p> 
<p>I hiked Fourmile Creek Trail last week, a few days after the lost hiker 
incident. For the first three miles in, until you reach the waterfalls, it's as 
well traveled as most roads in the county. More heavily than some.</p> 
<p>Two vehicles were already at the trailhead when I started. About a mile 
into the hike I met two dogs and their owner, heading back. The dogs were 
polite and stuck to the trail, until they saw a rabbit and took off after it.
</p> 
<p>The owner smiled fondly after them. I said, &quot;It would be nice if they 
didn't chase the wildlife. Next time it might be a fawn.&quot; She said, 
&quot;I don't think they've ever caught anything.&quot; I said, &quot;Not 
yet.&quot;</p> 
<p>Close to the waterfall, I met a man who told me that he was walking on two 
brand-new knees. &quot;They don't hurt a bit. My goal is to climb Pagosa 
Peak,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>There are two waterfalls at the head of the Fourmile valley. The 
destination for most people is the Fall Creek one, which comes in on your left. 
The water plummets about 300 feet down the steep cliff. At the bottom the fine 
spray sparkles like diamond mist.</p> 
<p>I felt so good when I reached this spot that I entertained the notion of 
continuing on up the trail to the top of the other waterfall, the Fourmile 
Creek one, and then going on to Fourmile Lake. I even contemplated returning to 
my car by way of the Anderson Trail. Sure it would make a long day, but I knew 
people who had done it. I decided to go a little farther, see how the trail was.
</p> 
<p>Right after you cross Fall Creek the trail becomes steep and heavily 
eroded. This used to be the Central Stock Driveway, and in the old days 
thousands of pointy little sheep feet went up and down it each summer. Now it's 
not recommended for stock. Take your horses up the Anderson Trail, if you're 
heading up to Fourmile and Turkey Lakes for fishing or hunting.</p> 
<p>At first it's just a steep trail. Partway up you get a different view of 
the falls and the U-shaped glacier-cut valley behind you. And then your 
attention becomes focused on the rocks at your feet. This is a trail? It's more 
like a boulder scramble. There is a small stream of water flowing down. Am I in 
the stream bed or on the trail? Brush grows over what might have been the 
trail, so I take to the rocks around it.</p> 
<p>Some people like this kind of thing; they scamper over the rocks like big 
horn sheep. I hate it. But I press on. And then I'm almost at the top of the 
cliff. There is Fourmile Creek just beginning to tumble over the edge. The 
sight is stunning. The roar of the water awesome.</p> 
<p>The path levels out under tall spruce. Hotshot and I camped here once with 
the Scouts, over 15 years ago. The trail was bad then, but at least you could 
still call it a trail.</p> 
<p>I continue on, still thinking of making it to the Anderson Trail. And then 
I come to a huge tree across the trail. The hillside is steep, and there's room 
to duck down and scramble under it. Barely. In the shade of the massive trunk 
is the first patch of snow. More follow. It's still early in the day and I can 
walk across them without sinking in.</p> 
<p>I've gone about half a mile beyond the Fall Creek waterfall, and it's taken 
almost an hour, when I reach the first crossing of Fourmile Creek. This spot is 
named The Steel Bridge on my map, but the only sign of any bridge is a few 4X4 
posts sticking out of the ground. The rest of the bridge has been missing for 
many years.</p> 
<p>This is the first of three crossings of Fourmile Creek. My guidebook says 
they can be difficult until &quot;midsummer.&quot; There are some small 
waterlogged tree trunks laying across the fast-moving stream and I don't like 
the look of them. I hate creek crossings, anyway.</p> 
<p>It's time to reconsider. I'm alone. The trail ahead might be full of snow 
and downed trees. I told my neighbor that I was hiking to the falls, not to the 
lake. No one would know where I was in an emergency. Going on would be foolish.
</p> 
<p>I'm getting enough of a high just having come this far. I sit beside the 
creek and eat my lunch. And then I head back down the trail.</p>

<p><b>Music - a precious art form with special powers</b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry </b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p><b>June 25</b></p> 
<p>This week I'm going to recommend a book in recognition of the Music in the 
Mountains summer season. Music is a precious art form that has special powers. 
And this book is available at Sisson Library.</p> 
<p>The book is &quot;The Inextinguishable Symphony,&quot; a true story of 
music and love in Nazi Germany. The author, Martin Goldsmith, is a radio 
musicologist who is writing about his parents, Gunther, a flutist, and his 
mother, Rosemary, a violinist who played in the Nazi's Kulturbund orchestra. 
The Nazis had formed the Kulturbund as a public distraction and a comfort for 
remaining Jews in the late '30s. It was a performing arts venue for Jews. They 
were allowed to perform only Jewish playrights and composers.</p> 
<p>The young couple was newly married.</p> 
<p>I'm going to extract from this book their experience rehearsing and 
performing &quot;Symphony No. 2, Resurrection&quot; by Gustave Mahler that's 
available on CD at Sisson Library.</p> 
<p>Goldsmith writes that his parents were extremely thrilled and relieved to 
finally get their passports to escape Germany for America Feb. 25, 1941, two 
days before the performance of Mahler's symphony, the &quot;Resurrection&quot; 
with the Kuba, (as the orchestra was called). This symphony of Mahler's was new 
to both and was a great inspiration to all the musicians in rehearsal. This was 
the last performance of the Kuba before it was closed.</p> 
<p>Mahler had cited a German poem called &quot;Resurrection&quot; as his 
inspiration for this second symphony of his:</p> 
<p>&quot;&#138; when the earth is silent and deserted &#138; only the 
long-drawn note of the bird of death &#138; soft and simple the words gently 
build up: you will rise again, my dust, after a short rest.&quot;</p> 
<p>Mahler then adds his own poetry which ends:</p> 
<p>&quot;I shall die to live. You will rise again, my heart, in a moment, and 
be borne up, through struggle, to God.&quot;</p> 
<p>Goldsmith describes the Mahler musical version of &quot;being borne upward 
through struggle&quot; as:</p> 
<p>&quot;&#138; a wondrous clangor of open chords sounded by the strings, 
winds and brass of the orchestra, undergirded by the rumbling strength of the 
organ and augmented by crashing percussion and pealing bells. In those last 
lingering moments flutist Gunther and violinist Rose Marie both experience awe 
they had previously known only in the presence of an incandescent sunset, a 
tremendous thunderstorm, or some similarly splendid composition of mature.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Music is masterful. It is the art form that fills the souls of many people. 
And so we can be thankful that Music in the Mountains reached us.</p> 
<p><b>Fun on the run</b></p>

<p><b>Cooperative Extension system:</b></p> 
<p><b>More relevant today than ever </b></p> 
<p><b>By Bill Nobles</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Today - 12:30 p.m. 4-H Entomology, Extension office, 12:30 p.m.</p> 
<p>Monday, June 21 - 4-H Dog Obedience, Extension office-Exhibit Hall, 4 p.m.; 
4-H Sports Fishing, Extension office, 4 p.m.; 4H-Shooting Sports, Ski &amp; Bow 
Rack, 4 p.m. </p> 
<p>The Cooperative Extension system today is very much about ensuring 
continued leadership in agriculture and the stewardship of our nation's land 
and other natural resources; creation of confident, public-service-oriented 
citizens through the 4-H youth development program and adult leadership 
training; the strengthening of families and the viability of communities. </p> 
<p>This strategic partnership of America's great public land grant 
universities and federal, state, and local governments enables the Cooperative 
Extension System to deliver critically needed educational programs at the grass 
roots level throughout the nation.</p> 
<p>Extension is unique in structure and function. With its university faculty 
and staff serving the states and territories-most located in the over 3,000 
counties across the country, the county Extension Office is truly the front 
door to America's land-grant universities. Local Extension professionals apply 
their expertise and connect community residents to the resources of the 
nation's great teaching and research universities to help solve 
locally-identified problems.</p> 
<p>This integration of teaching, research, and public service enables the 
Cooperative Extension System to respond to critical, emerging issues with 
research-based information. </p> 
<p>Today the Cooperative Extension system maintains its reputation for high 
quality, non-formal educational programs. Traditionally thought of as a rural 
program, the 21st century Extension system touches almost every aspect of 
people's lives in urban, suburban and rural areas. The range of topics 
Extension addresses includes:</p> 
<p>- 4-H Youth Development -develops important life skills in youth that build 
character and assist them in making career choices that strengthen citizenship 
and leadership. At-risk youth participate in school retention and enrichment 
programs. Youth learn science, math, and social skills through hands-on 
projects and activities</p> 
<p>- Agriculture - research and educational programs assist individuals to 
learn new ways to produce income through alternative enterprises, improved 
marketing strategies and management skills and help farmers and ranchers 
improve productivity through resource management, controlling crop pests, soil 
testing, livestock production practices, rangeland management and marketing. 
Urban agriculture programs support residents and communities with urban 
forestry, home and public landscape, pest and disease control, lawn waste 
management, farmers' markets, and developing skilled master gardeners</p> 
<p>- Community and Economic Development - assists local governments 
investigate and create viable options for economic and community development 
such as improved job creation and retention, small and medium sized business 
development, effective and coordinated homeland defense and emergency response, 
solid waste disposal, tourism development, workforce education, and land use 
planning</p> 
<p>- Family and Consumer Sciences - helps families and communities become more 
resilient and healthy by teaching nutrition, obesity prevention, food 
preparation skills, positive child care, family communication, financial 
management, and health care strategies</p> 
<p>- Leadership Development -trains extension professionals and volunteers to 
deliver programs in gardening, health and safety, family and consumer issues, 
4-H youth development, and prepares citizens to serve in leadership roles in 
the community</p> 
<p>- Natural Resources - teaches landowners and homeowners how to use natural 
resources more wisely and protect the environment with educational programs in 
water quality and water conservation, timber management, composting, and 
recycling. </p> 
<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, the American land-grant university system 
began the engagement movement. This next phase of higher learning involves the 
broader university-academic and clinical faculty, students, extension faculty 
and staff, and university leaders-in improving current and forming new mutually 
beneficial learning partnerships with residents and community leaders. As a 
result of the feedback derived from Extension's involvement in the greater 
community, academic programs are becoming more experiential and research is 
focusing on finding solutions to problems identified by the citizenry.</p> 
<p>The national Cooperative Extension system today is as critical to the 
future success of America in the 21st century as it was in the 20th century due 
to the increased diversity and complexity of the issues people encounter today. 
As was the case over a century ago, problems in most aspects of everyday living 
are best resolved by citizens in local communities. Yet unlike a century ago, 
local problem solving today has the potential of being impacted by a variety of 
national and global conditions that require the expertise and resources of the 
total university, and conversely, local decisions can much more quickly impact 
state, national and global issues.</p> 
<p>The Cooperative Extension system is a living, evolving, market-driven 
organization that responds to society's changing needs. Our nation must 
continue to expand lifelong learning to all of society and to utilize existing 
and new knowledge to solve complex problems. As a unique achievement in 
American education, the Cooperative Extension system continues its longstanding 
tradition of fulfilling that need by extending the university to the people to 
improve the quality of life for individuals, families, business and nonprofit 
organizations, and communities.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>Volunteerism shows its mettle by keeping the economy going</b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen </b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association's third annual garage sale was a 
huge one. There were people at 38 booths hawking their wares, and well over 300 
shoppers attending.</p> 
<p>Isn't it fun that you can buy and buy and some months later decide that you 
have tired of those purchases or perhaps it has outgrown its useful life. Waste 
not, want not? Not! Thrift is un-American.</p> 
<p>A friend of mine sniffs at my sense of thrift and calls it a &quot;sign of 
personal virtue and not much more.&quot; My husband puts it in kinder terms and 
although he tolerates my thriftiness, he continues to applaud consumerism. Need 
it to fuel the economy.</p> 
<p>So keep the economy going, folks. How much fun is it that one man's trash 
could be another man's treasure? Now the folks who have successfully unloaded 
their &quot;stuff&quot; can go out and buy more.</p> 
<p>Many thanks to the 32 volunteers who showed up to help at the PLPOA 
newsletter social. The mailing of 18,000 pieces would have been arduous without 
the kind help of the volunteers. You are appreciated, each and every one of you.
</p> 
<p>Please read the newsletter closely when you get your copy. The official 
ballot for the candidates for the board of directors and the proposed bylaw 
changes are a part of the newsletter.</p> 
<p>Back to the subject of volunteerism - it's a powerful thing. So much that 
goes on goes on successfully is a result of volunteers.</p> 
<p>Look at this year's local Relay for Life effort - over $53,000 was raised 
in this community to help cancer patients and to continue the funding of cancer 
research. A big group of volunteers made it all happen and every cent raised 
was voluntarily donated.</p> 
<p>The PLPOA team, under the able &quot;captainship&quot; of Steve Elges, 
raised over $1,700 and was awarded a certificate for top fund-raising 
non-profit group. Our success was due in large part to our volunteer walkers 
and volunteer donors.</p> 
<p>Runners, don't forget to lace-up your running shoes Saturday morning so you 
can run in support of our Humane Society. The Canine 9K starts at 8 a.m. with a 
7-7:45 check-in and late registration. Come run with me.</p> 
<p>A recent study showed that chopsticks may cause arthritis. A study of more 
than 2,500 residents of Beijing, China found that osteoarthritis was more 
common in the hands used to operate chopsticks - and in the fingers 
specifically stressed by chopstick use (the thumb and the second and third 
joints on the first and third fingers).</p> 
<p>While I realize the increase in risk associated with the chopstick use is 
negligible, especially in Pagosa, I find this study a good excuse to eat more 
finger foods.</p>

<p><b>Pagosa gymnasts second in state </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Second place.</p> 
<p>Of course they'd rather have been first, but Pagosa's young gymnasts are 
proud of their team achievement. </p> 
<p>And it isn't any second place, but second place in the state and it was 
paced by a record-setting individual performance by Raesha Ray.</p> 
<p>Competing Saturday in Eagles state competition in Colorado Springs against 
11 teams with 244 total gymnasts, Pagosa's entry came home with the 
second-place trophy and Ray's first-place individual medal.</p> 
<p>Competing for the Level 5's were Re'ahna Ray (Raesha's younger sister), 
Sienna Stretton and Toni Stoll and each brought home a state medal.</p> 
<p>Ray finished second in the all-around against girls in the child division 
(10 and under), scoring a 34.55. She had a close fight with a gymnast from the 
Aerials (home team for the event in Colorado Springs) losing by one tenth of a 
point. She also placed second in floor exercise with a 9.05, third on beam with 
8.6, fourth on bars with 8.55 and fourth in vault with 8.3. </p> 
<p>Toni Stoll was fifth on bars at 8.0, continuing what her coach, Jennifer 
Martin, calls &quot;a great consistent season in all competitions.&quot; The 
youngest member of the team, she scored above 8.0 on vault in every meet and 
&quot;stuck&quot; her beam routine at state.</p> 
<p>Stretton brought home the state silver medal in vault with an 8.5 score.</p>
<p>She started the season short three tricks in her bar routine, but mastered 
those efforts as the season wore on to bring her score up considerably.</p> 
<p>Team member Casey Crow pulled a hamstring in the last regular season meet 
and was unable to participate at state but showed her team spirit by marching 
in with the team and staying on the sidelines for moral support during the 
entire competition.</p> 
<p>Raesha Ray, Pagosa's upper level optional gymnast, placed second in the 
all-around for children 13 and younger with a 34.90.</p> 
<p>But she was state bar champion with a record-setting 9.425 performance; 
placed second in vault with an 8.625 and fifth in floor exercise at 8.65.</p> 
<p>&quot;Great,&quot; was Martin's reaction. &quot;She was a great performer 
for us all season and had it not been for a season-ending injury to a teammate, 
we might have been even stronger.&quot;</p> 
<p>She was referring to the broken finger suffered by veteran Shelby Stretton 
which left her unable to compete this season.</p> 
<p>She, too, was on hand at state for moral support and intends to perform 
again next year.</p>

youth,&quot; said Anthony J. Principi, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. &quot;The 
National Veterans Golden Age Games bring together veterans who landed at 
Normandy, POWs from Korea and Purple Heart recipients from Vietnam.</p> 
<p>Anyone who has ever attended the games and seen the esprit de corps among 
the veterans knows this event is an important part of their lives.&quot;</p> 
<p>The athletes compete in open and wheelchair divisions in specific age 
groups. Although most are veterans of World War II and the Korean War, 
increasing numbers of Vietnam-era veterans are participating in this annual 
nationwide competition.</p> 
<p>Joining long-term co-sponsors VA and the Veterans of Foreign Wars for the 
first time as a co-sponsor is Veterans Canteen Service (VCS).</p> 
<p>&quot;Veterans Canteen Service is proud to be one of the sponsors of the 
National Veterans Golden Age Games. These competitors reflect the courage, 
commitment and determination they demonstrated during their military 
service,&quot; said Jim Donahoe, VCS national director.</p> 
<p>&quot;The veterans who participate in the games send a clear message that 
exercise, fitness and a competitive spirit can help to defy the negative 
effects of age, injury or illness,&quot; said Edward S. Banas Sr., 
commander-in-chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. &quot;These games provide 
inspiration to countless Americans who seek to live a healthy and active 
life.&quot;</p> 
<p>The event begins with a gala opening ceremony at 7 p.m. on Sunday, July 18, 
in the exhibit hall of the convention center. Festivities include a musical 
salute to veterans by singer Lee Greenwood, a color guard, a parade of flags 
from each participating state and a ceremonial lighting of the torch. </p> 
<p>For the first time this year, the National Veterans Golden Age Games will 
serve as a qualifier for the National Senior Olympics, to be held June 3-8, 
2005, in Pittsburgh. The National Senior Olympics is a community-based member 
of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes senior U.S. athletes in 
several age-groups.</p> 
<p>Ken Peterson, a 62-year-old Army veteran and multi-year competitor in the 
games from Toledo, Ohio, has overcome three bouts with cancer, undergoing both 
radiation and chemotherapy treatments. Peterson believes that staying active 
and involved with sports helped his recovery. &quot;It saved my life,&quot; he 
said. &quot;Being active helps you both physically and emotionally.&quot;</p> 
<p>A leader in geriatric care, VA offers a spectrum of health care services to 
veterans. Nearly 65,000 veterans will receive long-term care this year through 
inpatient VA or state veterans home programs. More than 90 percent of VA's 
medical centers also provide noninstitutional long-term</p>

<p><b>Three men win golf league skins </b></p> 
<p>A Skins Game, made popular by the TV golf show of the same name, was the 
format for the Men's Golf League June 15.</p> 
<p>A &quot;skin&quot; is won by posting a net score on a hole which is lower 
than any other golfer's score on that hole. With 28 competitors, winning a skin 
is a very difficult thing to do.</p> 
<p>However, three golfers managed net birdies or eagles to win skins in this 
competition. They were Jim Horky, Alan Leo and Ray Henslee.</p> 
<p>Awards were also given for closest to the pin (also known as 
&quot;greenies&quot;) on each of the four par three holes. Frank Hutchins and 
Kim Winston each obtained one greenie and Russ Hatfield bested the field on two 
of the par three holes.</p> 
<p>The men's league is open to golfers of all levels. League dues are $25 for 
the season, payable in the pro shop. Competition begins every Wednesday at 1

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p><b>Find common ground </b> </p> 
<p>Let's continue to hammer on a point made here in the past, and by Sen. Ben 
Nighthorse Campbell in an article in The SUN two weeks ago. The point is 
simple: We must find strength in what we have in common and not allow 
small-minded partisanship to weaken us in the face of great danger.</p> 
<p>With news last week that Paul Johnson was kidnapped by terrorists and 
beheaded while yet another American civilian was shot and killed in Saudi 
Arabia, and with additional warnings about imminent attacks within the U.S., 
the message should be clear to the most resistant among us: There is a movement 
afoot in the world seeking our destruction, as individuals, as a society and a 
culture.</p> 
<p>Johnson is the second American taken hostage then brutally executed. 
Earlier, Nicholas Berg was kidnapped in Iraq and beheaded. In both cases, 
murderers displayed their act on the Internet in a show of gruesome bravado 
intended to recruit new members and to intimidate us.</p> 
<p>In both cases the men were killed because they were Americans.</p> 
<p>Chances are slim either was asked prior to his execution whether he was 
Republican or Democrat, &quot;liberal&quot; or a &quot;conservative.&quot;</p> 
<p>What is illuminated in this is a threat nearly as deadly as the hooded 
thugs who kidnap and kill. It is a threat of our own making.</p> 
<p>Our nation is divided as rarely before, polarized into factions tagged with 
emotionally-loaded labels. In some ways, the polarization goes back to the 
Nixon years, perhaps to the McCarthy era, and each side in an increasingly 
cartoonish political game contributes. The media bears as much blame as the 
political strategists who spend their days creating more garish, more 
outrageous characterizations of opponents. Many citizens now communicate with 
labels, yet cannot adequately explain what the labels mean. Many do their 
intellectual and political business trading in caricatures that, upon 
inspection, prove without substance - mere containers for personal 
frustrations, fears, thwarted ambitions.</p> 
<p>We are in danger of losing our foundation, of losing the very things our 
enemies hate, if we continue to buy into a vision of a radically polarized 
America.</p> 
<p>Our hope lies in the fact many Americans are still able to deal with 
complexity and ambiguity, to think through issues and make decisions without 
recourse to the stereotypes created by political strategists, PR people and 
biased media. The best of Americans do not exist in the oxygen-deprived 
extremes. They exist in the moderate center, in the rich heartland of 
cooperative American ideas and ideals. We need them to prevail.</p> 
<p>As Campbell said, the collective spirit embodied by the generation that 
fought and helped win World War II is not as evident today, that spirit 
assailed by simple-minded partisan thinking. He noted our enemies are counting 
on us to fight among ourselves then cede to their demands.</p> 
<p>The truth about our war against terrorists, now so burdened by shortsighted 
political reductionism, is it will likely go on for a very long time. Our 
children may have to battle terrorism. Their children may do battle in order to 
maintain our society. The blows against us will continue and we can ill afford 
to add to the damage by buying into a false view of America, of an America of 
extremes locked in irremediable conflict. The trash that comes across the 
Internet and the airwaves from campaign strategists works to strengthen this 
view; we cannot succumb. As Independence Day and the November elections near, 
we need to remind ourselves, despite the noise of negative campaigns and 
libelous discourse, that we are all American, that we have an enemy and it is 
not each other. Despite the political battles at home, we must find common 
ground and fight our greater battles together. Or we will lose.</p>

<p><b>Vignettes of Pagosa's faith</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>There is something instantly comforting about standing on the shores of the 
San Juan as people tell of their experiences with Hospice service.</p> 
<p>It happened again Saturday, an annual rite of reviving the spirit by 
planting something in memory of a friend or loved one who has passed us by to 
set the stage for reunion in eternity.</p> 
<p>The scene: Hospice Memorial Garden between the Chamber of Commerce and the 
river - a plot that is to be expanded in the near future because its tiny 
beginning, now four years past, has proved foresight was too small and more 
ground is needed. </p> 
<p>It could be a sad occasion but the spirit of Pagosans refuses to let it 
happen. The messages are upbeat, the story of love, of suffering made easier by 
the people of Hospice of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>What is Hospice? It is care for the person who is dying. It is love until 
the last moment. As stated Saturday, it is more than just home health care, 
&quot;It is a philosophy of living while dying.&quot;</p> 
<p>Appropriately, the opening musical selections was a duet of &quot;In the 
Garden&quot;. The Community Choir sang and high schoolers Samantha Ricker and 
Christine Morrison soloed with voices echoing eerily off the river banks.</p> 
<p>Still, it was the individual messages which of participants which set the 
tone for the day, special short statements about what Hospice had meant to the 
speakers and why they were participants.</p> 
<p>Hospice chaplain Don Straight talked of the practice of young children 
building sand castles and lamenting when the tide washes them away. Our loss of 
loved ones, he said, is first like the loss of sand castles. But as the 
children build new sand castles we build new lives, each based on the lessons 
learned and the guidance given.</p> 
<p>&quot;When I minister to a family in Hospice,&quot; he said, &quot;I find I 
don't minister to them, but they to me. How we handle loss is what we pass on 
to others. We can build castles again or we can feel sorry for ourselves.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Perhaps the most poignant of the stories was told by Margaret May, speaking 
of her sister and the continuing support she draws from her passing.</p> 
<p>&quot;She was a teacher, a vibrant woman in an English village. She had a 
ready smile and a love of life. She was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in 
her early '50s and the decline seemed almost immediate.&quot;</p> 
<p>But, she said, her sister would not give in. She had helped start a Hospice 
chapter in their community and eventually it would serve her.</p> 
<p>She would not admit defeat. She fought it until the very end. In fact, she 
taught until just 30 days before her death. She had to be pushed into the room 
in a wheelchair and pupils vied for the right to print messages on the 
chalkboard. But she kept her pace until Hospice had to serve her and her family 
near the end.</p> 
<p>It was in that vein that people began to plant - petunias, pansies, 
geraniums, small evergreens - and, in some cases, to label the plantings in 
honor of a loved one or a friend.</p> 
<p>It is visible evidence of Pagosa's faith.</p>

<p>The new waterworks improvement is nearing completion this week. While the 
old water wheel has served the town well and pumped many gallons of water, it 
is no longer the able machine it once was. Increased consumption of water, 
growth of the town and better fire protection necessitated the improvement. It 
is a sign of progress in the growth of the community and one that it is hoped 
will solve the water problems for some time to come.</p> 
<p>A plea to make every street in Pagosa Springs an &quot;Avenue of

<p>Water levels are starting to drop somewhat but it appears that high water 
may be running well into July this year. The San Juan River never reached flood 
stage during the spring melt, but it was mighty close at times.</p> 
<p>Warmer weather hit here this week with a high of 83 degrees being recorded 
Tuesday. Total precipitation for the month was .40 inches, which is well under

<p><b>Taking aim at youth: Bow club sponsors fundraiser for Pathfinders</b></p>
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>These targets can't run and hide. </p> 
<p>Antelopes. Raccoons. Bear. Deer. The Pink Panther for fun. Even a plain old 
rodent or two.</p> 
<p>The critters, 21 in all, spread out over a 3/4-mile course winding in and 
out and up and down the hills, stare with beady eyes at a parade of archers 
streaming by from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. on a fine summer Sunday. The critters' 
synthetic hides are worn, the designated kill zones dotted with the marks of 
arrows. </p> 
<p>Twelve points is the most that can be earned for hitting a vital kill zone. 
The points shift down a scale to five for hitting anywhere on the animal but 
the antlers. A miss equals zero. Small plaques nearby point out which business 
sponsored their purchase.</p> 
<p>This is 3D archery sponsored by the Pagosa Bow Club. The club, made up of 
about 46 members from all around Pagosa Country, sponsors Tuesday practice 
shoots yearround and monthly competition shoots during spring and summer.</p> 
<p>The goal of the club, which organized officially in 1992, is to promote 
archery to families and younger generations, to provide a way for hunters and 
non-hunters to hone their archery skills, and most of all, just to have fun.</p>
<p>&quot;It's set up to simulate hunting conditions,&quot; Donna Clemison, 
club secretary, said. Yardages are unmarked. Angles are tricky. Brush and 
trees, even gravel roads, are used to make the shots more difficult - always 
with safety in mind. &quot;But it's not just hunters who come and shoot,&quot; 
she said. &quot;We have those that just like to come out and shoot and those 
that prepare for the hunt, but the main point is to have fun together.&quot;</p>
<p>Clemison said she first participated in archery in high school. She dropped 
it, only to pick it up again when her stepson showed an interest many years ago.
</p> 
<p>&quot;I like the challenge,&quot; she said, &quot;and trying to at least 
keep up with and sometimes maybe even beating the guys.&quot;</p> 
<p>Generally, said Ron Schweickert, club president, it takes between one and a 
half to two hours to walk the course. Maybe more. It depends completely on the 
style of archery a person chooses. Using the more advanced, technical equipment 
tends to take longer because of the sighting and adjustments required 
perfecting the aim, he said.</p> 
<p>Any type of equipment - with the exception of crossbows - is accepted on 
the shoots and nearly all kinds are represented, from the most basic of 
longbows made of string and wood to the most complicated of compound bows. 
Schweickert prefers the more traditional equipment in his own shooting.</p> 
<p>&quot;I like the thrill of doing it the hard way,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
like hunting, but I like to do it the hardest way possible. This is it except 
for a rock and spear.&quot;</p> 
<p>Shooters travel in groups of at least three. One person is assigned to 
collect the arrows. The other two help determine scores.</p> 
<p>Teams shoot the range twice, taking aim at the targets from a different 
marker each time. One is a set of stakes. The other is a &quot;whisker,&quot; a 
red or yellow marker thrown on the ground.</p> 
<p>Clemison said the first shoot of the year is a money shoot with winners in 
each class getting a portion of 50 percent of the entry fees. Awards are 
determined based on the number of entries in a class. For the rest of the year, 
trophies or other equipment prizes are awarded instead of money.</p> 
<p>But winning isn't really everyone's goal, both board members stressed. It's 
more about having fun, and improvement.</p> 
<p>&quot;Archery is a very individualized sport from what you choose to shoot 
with to what you choose to shoot,&quot; Schweickert said. &quot;Many times, you 
just go out there against yourself, and ask yourself are you getting 
better?&quot;</p> 
<p>At the hunt in June many had finished their first round of shooting around 
the lunch hour. Others were straggling in to enjoy the last of the hamburgers 
on the grill.</p> 
<p>&quot;Great course,&quot; one man said to Schwieckert, who was also acting 
as chef. &quot;The angles. The up and downs were just great. The most deceiving 
one is the raccoon.&quot; It was also one of the last targets the shooters 
encountered before the short walk back to base, tired, dusty and ready for more.
</p> 
<p>The group designed the course on land just east of Pagosa Springs donated 
by the Laverty Family. Schwieckert said the Lavertys' generosity with land 
allowed the club to put together the 3/4-mile range, the longest they've ever 
attempted. Still, he said, safety is always a priority, and the range is safety 
certified and insured by the National Field Archery Association.</p> 
<p>Volunteers from the club gather the day before a shoot to set up the range, 
using ATVs to transport the target animals from where they are heaped when 
resting to their spots on the course. A practice range with hay bales and paper 
targets is erected near a shade tent to give people a chance to warm up and 
sight-in their equipment. Although shooting is their main focus, Schweickert 
said, the club holds one major membership meeting a year and sometimes short 
meetings following a shoot for announcements. Club members travel all over the 
state, sometimes all over the country, to attend similar competitions. Some, 
Schweickert said, are even sponsored by various archery supply companies.</p> 
<p>On Sunday, June 27, the bow club's competition shoot, set to start at 9 
a.m. with registration a half hour before, will be a benefit for Pagosa 
Pathfinders, a nonprofit youth club who participate in the Youth Hunter 
Education Challenge sponsored by the National Rifle Association.</p> 
<p>Mike Kraetsch, president of Pagosa Pathfinders, said youth ages 8-19 are 
eligible to participate in YHEC, a competition involving eight events, 
including: 3D archery, shotgun, muzzleloader, .22 rifle, wildlife 
identification, a hunter safety course, orienteering and a written test.</p> 
<p>About 27 Pagosa youths are members of Pathfinders, competing in regional, 
state and international challenges. This year, Kraetsch said, it will cost each 
participant around $1,000 just to travel to internationals in Pennsylvania. To 
pay for travel expenses, he said, the group participates in several annual 
fund-raisers. This is a new one on the agenda.</p> 
<p>Cost for the benefit shoot is $15 for a single youth or adult (13 and 
over); $20 for a couple or $25 for a family. Children under 13 are free, but 
must be accompanied by an adult.</p> 
<p>Schweickert said encouraging youth and families to take up archery is part 
of the club's goal. Sponsoring a shoot for the Pathfinders, whose members 
sometimes practice with the group, seemed a natural fit.</p> 
<p>&quot;We help teach them safety and they help teach us how to shoot,&quot; 
Schweickert said with a shake of his head, commenting on the accuracy of some 
of the young shooters.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's invaluable for our kids to get to shoot, to just have to worry 
about archery for a day instead of archery and seven other events,&quot; 
Kraetsch said.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Bow Club welcomes new members and guests. Annual membership dues 
are $15 for a single, and $20 for a family which includes two adults and all 
children under age 18 living in the same household. Cost for Tuesday night 
practice shoots, from 6 p.m. to dark, are $3 for members and $5 for nonmembers. 
The range is located one mile east of town on U.S. 160, directly across from 
Riverside Campground. For more information on the club, or sponsoring a target,

<p><b>Ute Strip settlement produced some humor</b></p> 
<p><b>John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>We've been writing about some of the settlers who claimed land on the Ute 
Strip, an area including such communities, past and present, as Allison, 
Tiffany, Oxford and others along the Colorado side of the New Mexico/Colorado 
border in the southwestern part of the state.</p> 
<p>Formerly Ute land, the Ute strip was made available for public homestead 
claims around the turn of the 20th century shortly after the Southern Utes had 
completed filing on homesteads of their choice within the former reservation 
boundaries.</p> 
<p>The land not claimed by Utes was opened to the public.</p> 
<p>One such settler was Walter Anderson who rode horseback from Cripple Creek 
to take up land near Bondad. Anderson was a bachelor at the time and as such 
was not required to live continuously on the land to prove up his claim, as 
were married men.</p> 
<p>After clearing his land and proving up on it, he sold half of it to his 
brother John. John brought his wife and her widowed sister with children 
followed. Walter married the sister. As was the custom of the day, the 
neighbors planned to shivaree the newlyweds.</p> 
<p>Walter planned to foil the shivaree by putting on one of his wife's dresses 
and then shooting to scare the crowd away.</p> 
<p>A problem developed when he couldn't get his arms all of the way into the 
dress. By that time, he couldn't get out either. Consequently, he entertained 
the crowd with the dress half on and half off.</p> 
<p>Walter was said to be fond of fine horses and owned an especially fine team 
of high stepping bays named Ribbon and Swimmer.</p> 
<p>During winter, the roads were never cleared of snow and sleighing was the 
best way of going places. Big bobsleds for hauling heavy loads were used for 
taking half the neighborhood to the schoolhouse for &quot;literary&quot; or 
church.</p> 
<p>A wagon box transferred to the sleigh and filled with straw and plenty of 
warm quilts made a snug carry-all for family and friends. When Walter's fine 
horses were hitched to the sleigh there was a real thrill for speed.</p> 
<p>The bells, usually borrowed from milk cows, sounded wonderful on frosty 
nights. There were no telephones. Instead, the bells sent ahead the message to 
put on coats and caps because the sled was approaching. On the return a taffy 
pull or other homemade refreshments awaited the famished crowd in one of the 
homes.</p> 
<p>Smaller sleighs were used for speed or when you wanted to be alone with 
that special girl. In the spring when mud was too deep for sleighs, the horses 
were saddled and often carried two each.</p> 
<p>Another Bondad settler was Wm. R. Mason, formerly of Victor, Colorado. 
Victor is small town near Cripple Creek. Mason's glowing account of his 
new-found property near Bondad motivated a number of his neighbors to join him 
in the southwestern Colorado community. Those early settlers remember sometimes 
unfriendly Indians and herds of wild horses coming down from the mesas to drink 
in the Animas River.</p> 
<p>To claim land in the Bondad area during the run, each man drove stakes in 
the ground to outline his claim. There was much overlapping and much trouble. 
Some contenders were bought off and others became discouraged and left.</p> 
<p>The William Bonds family was said to have lived in the Bondad area longer 
than any others. Mrs. Bonds had a great impact on the community because she was 
a practical nurse who combined her training with a caring heart and was always 
ready to help. For years Dr. Weston at Riverside was the only doctor who came 
to Elco. He was quite old, a Civil War veteran who had come to Riverside to 
retire. He drove a little white mare named Nellie hitched to a top buggy. By 
the time Dr. Weston reached a sick family, Mrs. Bonds was already there.</p> 
<p>More next week on early settlement in the San Juan Basin.</p>

<p><b>Pagosa forecast predicts 'more of the same'</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>&quot;More of the same&quot; is the forecast outlook for Pagosa Country 
through the coming week.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, while the latest predictions suggest a daily pattern of 
increasing clouds into the evening hours, the chance for anything but an 
isolated mountain shower or two remains slim.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're generally under a flat ridge of high pressure and expect to be 
for the next several days,&quot; says Jeff Colton, a forecaster with the 
National Weather Service office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;That means clouds building into the afternoon and then clearing out 
overnight,&quot; added Colton.</p> 
<p>&quot;There may be the chance for a few mountain storms, but we're not 
looking at much in the way of rain for the Pagosa area,&quot; concluded Colton. 
&quot;It looks like more of the same.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to Colton, clear skies this morning are expected to grow 
increasingly cloudy by this afternoon. Highs should reach into the 80s; lows 
should register in the 40s.</p> 
<p>Winds in the 10-15 miles per hour range are expected to accompany 
increasing clouds throughout the day Friday, along with highs in the upper 70s 
and lows in the 40s.</p> 
<p>Saturday calls for partly-cloudy skies, highs in the 75-85 range and lows 
in the 40s.</p> 
<p>Similar forecasts for Sunday through Tuesday include predictions of 
mostly-clear conditions, highs around 80 and lows in the mid-40s.</p> 
<p>A 30-percent chance for afternoon showers is in the forecast for Wednesday, 
as are highs in the upper 70s and lows near 40.</p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week in Pagosa Springs was 77 
degrees. The average low was 39. Moisture totals for the week, in town, 
amounted to zero.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the area fire danger as &quot;very 
high.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fire restrictions went into effect Monday in Zone 1, the lower-elevation 
zone, of the San Juan Public Lands.</p> 
<p>The restrictions are Stage 1 restrictions which mean:</p> 
<p>- campfires are limited to permanent fire rings or grates within developed 
campgrounds;</p> 
<p>- smoking is limited to vehicles, buildings, or 3-ft wide areas cleared of 
vegetation;</p> 
<p>- chain saws and other internal-combustion engines must have approved, 
working spark arresters;</p> 
<p>- acetylene and other torches with an open flame may not be used; and,</p> 
<p>- the use of explosives is prohibited.</p> 
<p>For updates on federal fire restrictions, call the Pagosa Ranger District 
office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>According to the latest SNOTEL data, the snowpack level for the Upper San 
Juan River Basin has reached minimum levels, with melt-out nearly completed.</p>
<p>San Juan River flow through town ranged from approximately 900 cubic feet 
per second to 400 cubic feet per second last week. The river's historic median 
flow for the week of June 24 equals roughly 900 cubic feet per second.</p>

<p><b>Summer's start opened lightning awareness week </b></p> 
<p>The official start of summer on June 20 marked the peak season for a deadly 
and yet dangerously misunderstood weather phenomena: lightning.</p> 
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather 
Service and Minnesota Twins All Star Center Fielder Torii Hunter, along with 
other partners, are campaigning to alert the nation to the dangers of lightning 
to help save lives.</p> 
<p>NOAA, is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p> 
<p>The campaign kicked off this week &amp;emdash; the nationwide Lightning 
Safety Awareness Week &amp;emdash; and continues throughout the year with the 
clear message &quot;Lightning Kills, Play It Safe.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Lightning is an underrated killer, claiming more lives each year than 
tornadoes or hurricanes,&quot; said retired Air Force Brig. Gen. David L. 
Johnson, NWS director. &quot;Summer is the time when we enjoy outdoor sports 
with friends and families, but a lightning strike can turn fun to tragedy in an 
instant.&quot;</p> 
<p>Hunter is featured on a safety poster designed for schools, stadiums, 
sporting goods stores, and other outdoor venues with the message: &quot;When 
you hear thunder, get indoors. With lightning, it's one strike and you're 
out!&quot;</p> 
<p>Although the summer months are the most dangerous, lightning casualties 
occur year-round. Overall, approximately 25 million cloud-to-ground lightning 
strikes occur in the United States each year. During the past 30 years, 
lightning strikes have killed an average of 67 people each year &amp;emdash; 
compared with 65 tornado fatalities and 14 hurricane deaths.</p> 
<p>&quot;All thunderstorms have the potential to produce lightning, so it's up 
to all of us to heed the warnings,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Lightning can 
strike up to 10 miles away from a thunderstorm.&quot;</p> 
<p>National Weather Service is the primary source for weather data, forecasts 
and warnings for the United States and its territories. It is the most advanced 
weather and flood warning and forecast system in the world, helping to protect 
lives and property and enhance the national economy.</p> 
<p>NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety 
through the prediction and research of weather and climate related events and 
providing environmental stewardship of the nation's coastal and marine 
resources.</p>
