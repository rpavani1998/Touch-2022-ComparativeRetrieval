<h3>Talking about Revelation: Developing an Eschatological Hermaneutic</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;I have written before about how local churches need to engage with 
Revelation. To some, this might be an insurmountable task.</p> 
<p>The character of Revelation makes an auditory involvement necessary.<strong>
 In country terms; We need to HEAR Revelation.</strong></p> 
<p>Those in the company of preachers must learn to call the church to its 
eschatological dwelling place.&nbsp; In the enterprise of the earthly church 
taking Revelation back, local pastors serve both as truck drivers and road 
crew.&nbsp; We direct the energy as well as take care of the movement so that 
the laity can travel alongside. Intentionally preaching eschatologically means 
a deliberate admonition of the end that comes across as assured as the 
deliberate notions of beginning. Our role is to theologically play the 
childhood game of &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo;.<strong>We are story-tellers, 
not date-setters.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As pastors we must tell people about the other world,&nbsp; living in the 
the subversive act of preached hope. Instead of romantic historical meanderings 
that lament morals gone amuck, we focus on preached time. Preached time creates 
the path to New Jerusalem.&nbsp; This alternate narrative answers the question 
of who really is in charge.</p> 
<p>Whenever I teach Revelation to a new group of people, I start with a 
question. It goes something like this;<em> &quot;I am going to let you make a 
decision as to how we will read this book and how I will teach it to you. We 
can either let Revelation be a book that only pertains to a distinct group of 
people at only one time in the history of the world or we can read it as though 
it has informed the church for 2000 years and will continue to speak to 
us.&quot;</em></p> 
<p>I have never had a group take option A. Even if they are hardcore Left 
Behinders, the second choice just sounds better. If teaching Revelation freaks 
you out, let the congregation make the first choice. Present to them a basic 
reading strategy. It will allow you to stay away from so many testy issues.</p> 
<p>Revelation doesn't work in a passive setting. We have to be intentional and 
deliberate with it, but shouldn't we with all scripture?</p>

<h3>Contemporary Communion in Advent</h3> 
<p>This Christmas Eve we are having communion together in my congregation. I 
pastor and lead the contemporary service at my church and over the last few 
months we have used the more formal Great Thanksgiving liturgy in the United 
Methodist Hymnal. Due to both time and the fact I we have been pretty high 
church lately, I decided to use a less formal approach to communion for 
Christmas Eve.</p> 
<p>The tension revolves in the sacramental conviction I have as a Methodist 
pastor to keep communion in line with the greater tradition of the Church. 
Specific words do not matter, but the greater story does. I wanted to find 
something brief but strong and would fit well within our service.</p> 
<p>This Advent, my secret weapon for a few special services as been the A 
Christmas Sourcebook. I found this while in seminary and it has proven its 
worth several times over. It has plenty small bits that work well in Advent and 
Christmas services.<strong>It is a must buy for worship designers.</strong></p> 
<p>Below is what I am using to tell the story of Christ during our communion 
time. You can find it on pg. 23 of the sourcebook.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>The grace of God has appeared, ordering salvation to all men and women. 
It trains us to reject the godless ways and worldly desires and live 
temperately, justly and devoutly in this age as we await our blessed hope, the 
appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Christ Jesus. It was 
he who sacrificed himself for us, to redeem us from all unrighteousness and to 
cleanse for himself a people of his own, eager to do what is right.</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I wanted to share this great resource with you. Buy it and be ready for 
next Advent season.</p> <br>

<h3>Big Candy Bar Church: A meditation on Halloween</h3> 
<p>I grew up in a neighborhood full of rent houses. They were all flash built 
in several years. It was the perfect place to raise children. Almost every 
house had a kid my age. Consequently, these circumstances meant it was a 
horrible place to trick or treat. Between a bunch of broke young families not 
having the money to really do it up AND having their own children to cart 
around...we had to go offsite.</p> 
<p>Everyone remembers doing this. You head over to the rich part of town on 
October 31st. These are the houses that have all sorts of surprises.Guys in 
costume jumping out and scaring you, automatic ghosts falling out of the tree 
and Big Candy Bars. You know, not this fun size nonsense...but full size Gas 
Station candy bars.&nbsp; Those houses are remembered. They might even be 
marked on a map by some grubby hands covered in nougat and caramel.</p> 
<p>How do our churches fit into this scheme? Are we known for starlight mints, 
the mini Reece's cups or a big Butterfinger? This isn't about how much $$$ we 
give away...but the gospel message we deliver. Do we talk about an abundant 
life with God or bemoan the loss of a previous Christian culture? Are we 
pushing forward to better express the life of the sacrificing Son of God?</p> 
<p>As Christians, the call to the Kingdom of God should be ever present in our 
vision. The writers of the Gospel show us this message is a reality we can 
hardly comprehend. We need to express this fullness in every way, shape and 
form. In each community this looks different. What works for me will be 
different from you.</p> 
<p>But we need to load the deck. Fill up the proverbial bucket with the good 
stuff. Don't hold back. People remember who gave them the best.</p> <br>

<h3>Pastors, don't quit your day jobs...</h3> 
<p>Yesterday, I spent the better part of my morning doing something I have 
done for over half my life. I organized, rewired and did some planning for my 
churches sound system. This past weekend, I took a last minute call to put 
together a system for an outside event, haul the gear, set it up and run it 
throughout the event. One of my members asked if I imagined I this as part of 
my job description. I replied with &quot;I have running audio for 15 years and 
I don't think I will ever not.&quot;</p> 
<p>Years ago, I actually thought my calling to ministry would be serving as a 
technical director for a large church. It was through a mentoring relationship 
that I found giftings in discipleship, teaching and leading. I am eternally 
thankful for my friendScott for helping me realize the true depths of a 
pastoral call.</p> 
<p>I have a skill set useful to my congregation as well as others. Spending 
years on the road and years running installed systems give me a unique 
perspective in a sometimes perplexing field. How often have sound engineers 
argued with pastors over volume or worked long hours on a project that to the 
uninformed appears simple? It isn't a glamours job at all.&nbsp; It also would 
be horrible leadership if I refused to help out in an area I am gifted in.</p> 
<p>God gifts all of us, not just clergy, with skill sets needed by the church. 
Part of our overall call to stewardship means sharing every gift towards the 
advancement of God's kingdom. How can we lead our congregations in this if we 
are not willing and able to do it ourselves?</p> 
<p>Pastors, don't quit your days jobs. For some of us that mean washing dishes 
or waiting tables. Others might have a more glamorous vocational history. No 
matter what...never think you have a gifting unnecessary to the leadership of 
your church.</p> <br>

<h3>3 things churches can learn from Netflix</h3> 
<p> Over the last few months, controversy has surrounded movie provider Netflix
. Netflix allows members to rent movies via traditional mail as well as 
provides streaming content. In many American households Netflix gets its own 
line item in the budget. I have had their service off and on for almost 10 
years.</p> 
<p>Starting this summer, the company drastically started lost membership by 
increasing subscription fees. Then earlier this fall, the company announced it 
was starting an additional company to handle its mail order DVD service, and 
Netflix would only concentrate on streaming content.&nbsp; Multiple problems 
arose and Netflix took a pretty heavy loss,with half the stock value dropping 
last month.</p> 
<p>Yesterday they announced they are not moving to the two company structure 
and are going back to the previous model, as well as not changing pricing 
structures again. While some agree that this change back was needed, others see 
it as an attempt to cover their bottom line and hopefully regain capital and 
their momentum as a market leader. Serious street cred has been lost.</p> 
<p>The situation can really speak into how churches make shifts in their 
various services/offerings and programs.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Major shifts cannot be made behind closed doors with a select 
group.</strong><br>
While we can't expect a company to announce, &quot;Hey we 
will be raising prices...what do you think is fair?&quot;, a certain level of 
transparency is expected today.&nbsp; Certainly the folks at Netflix thought 
this was all a good idea and would provide a better experience. But ultimately, 
they assumed a value that simply wasn't true.</p> 
<p>In churches we often make some pretty major decisions with just a couple of 
people. A few years back at Willow Creek's leadership summit, Bill Hybels 
surprised the crowds by openly admitting his previous idea of leadership was 
flawed. Where in the past he felt folks needed him to come up with these 
dramatic plans and then implement them, in fact the church themselves wanted to 
be part of visioning process.</p> 
<p>Current younger generations feel a level of ownership inside their churches 
and calling them to leadership means making them involved in the process of 
leadership...not just shoring it up. Innovation implementation should go 
through the hands of the people. After all, it is their community we are trying 
to impact.</p> 
<p>Don't drop major shifts in peoples laps.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Cultural patterns inform shifts.</strong><br>
Netflix was 
attempting to read a hole in the market. Their new split program allowed them 
to rent video games as well as movies. While this move did provide a new 
service, it did so at the expense of many other things. Namely, for folks who 
wanted to both get content by mail as well as by stream, two accounts would 
need maintenance. For an increasingly mobile world it doesn't work. This one 
positivc change didn't override the other negative changes</p> 
<p>Any sort of shifts we feel are important for church must take cultural 
patterns seriously. Things have changed!</p> 
<p>Years ago, the only movie rental option was your local Blockbuster. No 
matter if the movie was in, if it was in good shape or quality of customer 
service, almost everyone had a Blockbuster card. You couldn't get around it. 
You dealt with the negatives because you wanted to rent<em>Ernest Goes to Camp
</em>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Now there are options. You can stream through several places, you can 
rent through Redbox, you can drop by a brick and motor or you can use Netflix 
by mail. We aren't that loyal either. Whatever is the quickest way to get a 
movie usually is the option we take.</p> 
<p>Church is the same way. We need to take in account for contextual shifts. 
This might mean worship at a time beyond Sunday morning, small groups meeting 
in non-traditional locations or exploratory looks at worship music. The local 
context shapes how the local church worships.</p> 
<p>Remember that people LOVED Netflix before these issues. Loyalty is a 
increasingly relative concept in our times. When church begins to no longer 
make sense, it will show and people don't have emotional attachements as strong 
as in the past.</p> 
<p>When investigating a shift remember culture matters.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Shifts always lead to better culture.</strong><br>
In the past, 
single provider business could make these sort of monumental decisions. That is 
why we have monopoly laws. Netflix could have assumed people would just roll 
with these changes because they needed the product that much. Netflix, as a 
company embraced by new media and business, acted very much with an old and 
outdated model. They neglected to bring what consumers now value the most; a 
better culture.</p> 
<p>In church, we have to consistently be thinking about how our shifts lead to 
a better expression of the gospel of Jesus and the proclamation of the 
in-breaking Kingdom of God. If our shifts do not provide a better expression of 
this, we aren't being faithful to our mission.</p> 
<p>By drawing into &quot;butt cover mode&quot; these new recovery shifts by 
Netflix also failed to provide better culture. A bad taste was left in the 
mouth of the customer.</p> 
<p>When having these discussions in a church context we have to remember the 
fine line between prophetic voice and worship consumption. We aren't selling a 
product, but we are in the business of gospel transformation. We have a 
different set of rules we play by. Sometimes what we do doesn't make fiscal 
sense...but it makes kingdom sense.</p> 
<p>Shifts in our churches must always lead to a better vision of Jesus.</p>

<h3>My Bible</h3> 
<p> My church started a community reading of the New Testament last week. It 
has been great getting reports from members who are reading together. Scripture 
always changes our lives, in ways we understand and in ways we often don't.</p> 
<p>Last week, our pastor shared a story about his favorite Bible. I have 
writtenbefore about different Bibles I own, and I want to share the evolution 
of my current daily Bible. It is great to see something turn into a treasured 
possession and why I continue to try to keep its pages and cover from falling 
apart.</p> 
<p>I was sent a NRSV notetakers edition several years ago to review. After 
putting it through the paces, I realized this would be the perfect Bible for 
seminary. It ended up being my daily reader. I have gone cover to cover with it 
a few times and I love seeing dates and notes from previous readings. I have 
had to tape it together in a few places and the cover has some gaff tape on it 
as well.</p> 
<p>I have gotten to the point where I know exactly were certain passages 
are...on the right or left page and where on that page. The margins make it 
nice for making outlines, taking notes and doing some quick IBS directly on the 
page.</p> 
<p>More than anything, I appreciate the formation that has taken place while 
using this bible. I love seeing passages I have preached, written papers on and 
used in Bible studies. I love seeing my own notes taken during times of worship 
and prayer. This Bible can serve as the memoir for the last few years of my 
life.</p> 
<p>Our Bibles are like roadmaps to sanctification. They tell us where we have 
been and the keep us on the path for the future. They have stories and we 
should tell those stories.</p> <br>

<h3>How the New Facebook effects Church Social Media</h3> 
<p> Unless you ran a marathon in Antarctica last week, you have noticed the 
changes inFacebook. While the uproar mostly consists of individual users, the 
changes in content management mean churches and ministries will need to 
reexamine how they use Facebook in light of the new controls and settings.</p> 
<p>Todd Wasserman wrote a great article over at mashable.com about how this 
affects marketers and we can learn a few lessons. The most important point was 
this.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>How to do that? David Berkowitz, senior director of emerging media and 
innovation for360i, says Facebook will now be about branding actions. 
&ldquo;Before on Facebook it was about getting people to &lsquo;Like&rsquo; the 
brand,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s about getting people to take 
social actions enabled by that brand.&rdquo; For example, if a consumer posts 
an update about a run they just took, that&rsquo;s a prime opportunity for 
Nike. &ldquo;If your run is powered by Nike, you might still wear 
Adidas,&rdquo; says Berkowitz, &ldquo;but Adidas will have to find something 
else that&rsquo;s social about its brand to become part of your story.&rdquo;
</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>The new custom settings allow Facebook to gradually filter out content the 
user appears to not engage in. If people that &quot;like&quot; your ministry on 
Facebook tend to not engage, eventually that means they will not be seeing your 
updates in their feed.<strong>Content is&nbsp; King</strong>. What we produce 
and share on Facebook as ministries must viably offer something to the general 
public that provides a worthwhile meaning in their life.</p> 
<p>Here are two broad ways that help us put perspective in our use of social 
media in the Church;</p> 
<p><strong>1. Having Transforming Content...not random information</strong><br>
What we offer people needs to matter. Yes, updates about events and schedules 
will still be part of Facebook. But we also need to offer an environment wear 
people can see the gospel truth of change. We tell stories through Facebook, we 
share our lives together and we provide the necessary tools for people to have 
this new life through Jesus. The directionality of our presentation changes, 
but the basic truth of Jesus doesn't. Get out of the mentality that Facebook is 
the 21st century Church Bulletin and into the reality of it being the prophetic 
voice of salvation.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Having Deliberate Christian Community...not generic friends
</strong><br>
It is real easy to just collect followers on Facebook. Facebook 
makes it handy to have a huge list of folks to message or present your latest 
video/sermon or bible study series too. Yes, the content we are sharing might 
be truly transformative. The additional part of this is making sure we see 
these are folks that we truly care about. Our content should be causing folks 
to encounter real life together in the actual world. The people that choose to 
engage with our ministries on Facebook are worthy of the same care and 
attention of those who spend time in our worship services during the week.</p> 
<p>If we want for social media to be a viable way we reach people, it is 
necessary to follow the way Facebook chooses to distribute updates. When using 
social media, intentionality is key. Make sure your content is easy to digest 
and engage. Sculpt what you create to fit the way people are using and 
retaining information. Most of all, have fun with it!</p> <br>

<h3>Vacant Rooms</h3> 
<p> My house is huge. I guess the church designed it for large families, but 
Meredith and I plus Emma the dachshund don't take up that much space. We have 
several rooms that I go days without stepping into. The rooms are nicely 
equipped with furniture historical to the house, completely ready for people. 
You can consider it a perk ofparsonage living.</p> 
<p>But I think about these empty room, full of the necessary things for 
life...but without any actual living going on in them. At a base level, I can 
consider them only necessary for specific purposes, liking visiting family or 
hospitality. These are good purposes, but not part of daily living.</p> 
<p>We all have vacant rooms like this in our lives. They are formed and 
available for our dwelling and usually even equipped, but never used.</p> 
<p>Past lives of holy fervor constructed them. We open the door on them from 
time to time, but once within they seem foreign. We might even need to 
acclimate ourselves to living in the space again. Forgotten about, we slowly 
loose even the memory of these places in our hearts and close the door to the 
actions of the Holy Spirit that built them.</p> 
<p>I have said before Christianity is not a stop and go faith. The believer 
moving in sanctification will be pushing forward. Even in moments of trial and 
struggle we don't shut doors in the spiritual places built. We all hate wasted 
space and in a life with God it is easy to fall into the trap.</p> 
<p>So I have started living in my extra space, setting aside spiritual rhythms 
that only take place in these rooms. My large dining room table is great for 
sermon prep and the couches are good for reading. After a month I am fully 
moving into this house. I pray that each of us will fully move into the place 
God has built in our hearts, minds and souls.</p> <br>

<h3>Rest</h3> 
<p> Rest is a part of life that many of us don't get to experience too often. 
We attempt to &quot;rest&quot; in 3 hour blocks or hurriedly force it upon 
ourselves in week blocks once a year. When we do that we are really cheating on 
rest.</p> 
<p>Rest has been on my mind lately. Probably because I am tired all the time. 
Every time I think I have some moments to myself, I realize I have a long list 
of things to get done around the house. I usually Sabbath pretty well, but 
lately that has meant passed out on the couch with the dog. Rest is also done 
ever mindful that I might have to stop rest and attend to my pastoral duties.
</p> 
<p>I have forgotten how to be satisfied with rest, and I am reminded of it in 
my own Bible reading these last few days.</p> 
<p>Scripture teaches us a few things about rest. I can think of 3 key 
movements;</p> 
<p>1. God rested on the 7th day of creation.</p> 
<p>2. The land (and people) being &quot;at rest&quot; from the occupation of 
Joshua.</p> 
<p>3. The eternal rest in Hebrews 4.</p> 
<p>Rest is in response to doing holy work. Rest is a reflection back on what 
God has done for his people (both individually and corporately). How often is 
our rest time look back and remember what God has done for us? How can our 
simple puttering around on Saturday be a holy activity?</p> 
<p>We need to rejoice in the small things. Today I butchered up some chicken 
wings and threw them on the charcoal side of my grill. I could have bought the 
pre-butchered wings and used the gas side...but I wanted to really take part in 
my lunch. I wanted to be involved in the steps. When I actually have my lunch 
(later than expected), I am pretty sure I will enjoy it more.</p> 
<p>On this weekend, take these scattered moments to reflect on what how God 
has been active in your life this week. Give him praise for it and prepare 
yourself for Sunday. This is a step to step life...not jump to jump.</p> <br>
