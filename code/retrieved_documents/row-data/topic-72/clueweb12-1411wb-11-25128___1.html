<p> &laquo; TCA's and Dual Expat Careers | Main | Response to Iyabo on Barack 
Obama &raquo; </p> 
<h2>April 19, 2007</h2> 
<h3>Barack Obama is a Third Culture Kid!</h3> 
<p>I just finished reading Lawrence Downes' <em>New York Times</em> editorial 
observations on Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama,Barack Obama, 
Estranged in a Strange Land. If you have been following his campaign, then you 
have probably heard that Sen Obama is considered by many to be one of the 
fastest rising stars in U.S. politics. Some have even likened his new status to 
a celebrity image of political &quot;Rock Star&quot;. In 2005,Time magazine 
named Obama one of the &quot;<em>worlds most influential people who shape our 
lives,&quot;</em> and also called him &quot;<em>one of the most admired 
politicians in America&quot;</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sen. Obama also won a Grammy for 
the audio version of his 1995 memoir,Dreams from My Father, which spent one 
year on the<em>New York Times </em>bestseller list, and he was featured on the 
covers of<em>Men's Vogue</em> and <em>Newsweek.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As a TCA and the mother of four TCKs, what I found even more exciting and 
notable about Obama's celebrity status on the political and world scene is that 
he is also one of the fastest rising adult TCKs!!</p> 
<p>The first time that I heard about Sen Barack Obama was during a 
conversation a few years ago with my good friend,&nbsp;Ruth E. Van Reken. I 
still vividly recall that day, as she excitedly told me about this up and 
coming young politician from the Chicago area, and, that to her great pleasure, 
he was a TCK! Ruth added that, in her opinion, Obama represented our hope for 
the future, as was heralded by sociologist, Ted Ward in 1989, when he declared 
that TCKs were the &quot;prototype citizens of the future&quot;.</p> 
<p>It seems that in the case of Barack Obama,&nbsp; Ruth Van Reken and Ted 
Ward were right!!</p> 
<p>In his memoir, Dreams from My Father, Obama shares that he was born in 
Honolulu, Hawaii. His father, an economist, was born in Kenya and his mother, a 
white American from Kansas, first met while they were students at the East-West 
Center at the University of Hawaii. When Obama was two years old, his parents 
were divorced, and his mother, Ann Obama later married Lolo Sotero, another 
foreign student from Indonesia. In 1967, his family moved to Jakarta, where 
Obama attended local schools from ages six to 10. He then returned to Honolulu 
to live with his maternal grandparents while attending thePunahou School from 
5th grade through his graduation from high school in 1979.Obama clearly knew 
the emotional challenges of transitioning between cultures and growing up in 
strange lands and having experienced his own, at times painful, personal search 
for identity from the perspective of being a TCK, biracial, and a perpetual 
lifestyle as an insider/outsider.</p> 
<p>In TCK's Come of Age, posted on the Transition Dynamics website of Dr 
Barbara Shaetti (an expatriate consultant and a bi-cultural TCK), intercultural 
consultant,Vicki Lambiri states that there are a number of TCK personalities 
that quite often appear in the media. She adds that interviews with well known 
TCKs abound, but the general public doesn't know it, since having an awareness 
and understanding of the TCK experiences has not quite &quot;penetrated into 
the consciousness of mainstream American society or for that matter any 
society.&quot; She believes that as the TCK populations continues to grow, it 
is important&nbsp; that for the media and reporters to better understand 
&quot;how to interpret the significance of the TCK childhood and its influence 
on adult behaviors.&quot;</p> 
<p>Although a very good article and synopsis of his experiences, the Downes 
op-ed missed a wonderful opportunity to tie some of his observations about Sen 
Obama to his lived TCK experience and how it helped to inform his worldview. 
This lived TCK expereince, most likely has contributed to Obama's broad appeal 
and to his earning a reputation as anincredibly unifying figure.</p> 
<p>I agree Vicki! </p> 
<p>Barack Obama's growing media and global presence is a great example of why 
the time is now to spread the word to an even&nbsp; broader audience regarding 
the importance of the &quot;third culture&quot; experience and its influence on 
our globalized society!!</p>

<p>I find this all very enlightening!<br>
 I was once asked why I often find 
myself in situations where I am the minority, when I am not part of a minority. 
I had not thought too much about this until it was presented to me. But once I 
was aware of it I began to question myself and wonder if I could answer the 
question if I really needed to.<br>
 Then I reconnected with Paulette and she 
sent me the article on Cross Cultural Kids that she had written with Ruth Van 
Renken, it was amazing! It really helped me wrap my head around the paths that 
I have taken in life and why I always end up deep within other cultures other 
then my own.<br>
 I spent the formative years of my youth basically living at 
the Bethel's. From the ages of 12-17 we were inseparable. It wasn't until 
reading the article I realized just how much they had influenced my life. I was 
introduced to culture that my biological family could have never given me and 
became a member of a family that I hold close and dear to my heart to this very 
day!</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Renee ODonnell | April 26, 2007 at 11:18 PM </p> <br>

<p>As I read Iyabo&rsquo;s response, my heart was deeply moved. We have many 
parallels in our experiences &ndash; only these experiences happened to us in 
different skin color.</p> 
<p>I, too, am a &ldquo;Nigerian,&rdquo; if birthplace counts, for I was born 
in Kano, Nigeria to an American father who had been born and raised as a TCK in 
Iran. My mom was born and raised her entire life in Chicago, Illinois. I lived 
in Nigeria until I moved to the United States at age 13. But in those days, 
people with white skin were not allowed to become citizens lest (as I 
understand it) some of the apartheid issues present in other parts of Africa 
should rear their ugly head in Nigeria. And so, although I played soccer with 
my Nigerian friends every day and we sat in the same classroom during the 
school years (albeit doing different curriculum &ndash;theirs British, mine 
American), I always knew that I could never claim full identity as an 
&ldquo;us&rdquo; with them. My skin color as well as my American passport 
precluded that.</p> 
<p>But at least in Nigeria, I had the clear identity of being a 
&ldquo;foreigner.&rdquo; And so, when I knew I wasn&rsquo;t exactly &ldquo;the 
same as,&rdquo; I also knew that it was &ldquo;OK&rdquo; because I came from 
&ldquo;The States&rdquo; and when I returned there, I knew I would finally 
&ldquo;fit.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>TCKs/adult TCKs who have lived for a very long period outside their 
passport culture know that this is a myth. When I returned to school for my 8th 
grade year I fit in less than I ever had in my life. In those pre-civil rights 
days I shared the same skin color as all others in class, but little else. 
Here, where I expected to fit completely, I felt more like a total stranger 
than I had ever felt while living as a &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo; in Nigeria. 
Norma McCaig, founder of Global Nomads, International, and Dave Pollock, my 
co-author of &quot;Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds,&quot; called 
this the &ldquo;hidden immigrant&rdquo; experience&hellip;a time you return to 
land supposedly your own but one in which you don&rsquo;t know the rules of 
this culture any more than a true immigrant because you have not been born and 
bred here. If you were an obvious immigrant or foreigner, others would 
understand why you didn&rsquo;t know a slang word or how to use the pay phone 
or which coin was needed to make the correct change. But when you look and 
speak like the majority culture around you, or the culture you are assumed to 
be &ndash; e.g. for Iyabo, that she was/is African American - little but 
ridicule is offered for those same cultural miscues.</p> 
<p>My response was similar to Iyabo&rsquo;s. While some choose a 
&ldquo;screamer&rsquo;s reaction&rdquo; at this point&hellip;making sure others 
know they are not the same by adopting some behavior, dress, or whatever to 
prove that&hellip;Iyabo and I chose another common reaction. We sought to 
become chameleons. She chose to try to assimilate into the African American 
culture, I did the same for the white cultural world then around me in the 
northwest area of Chicago. I no longer mentioned any of my African roots but 
became the best chameleon I could so that I could finally become a 
&ldquo;them.&rdquo; I was so successful that, as a senior in high school, I 
finally mentioned something about living in Africa to the student who had sat 
opposite me in home room for 4 years and he was shocked. &ldquo;I had no idea 
you had ever lived in Africa,&rdquo; he said. But I remember when going forward 
for an award in my senior year, inside I thought &ldquo;If they knew who I 
really was, they wouldn&rsquo;t have given this to me.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Fast forward (as I get older the story gets too long!)&hellip;when my 
husband was a senior in medical school, we tried to return to Nigeria to do one 
of his electives. My mother and father still lived there, I was pregnant and 
wanted to have my child in the land of my birth, and we had a scholarship to 
go. Imagine my unbelievable surprise when Nigeria would not give us a visa to 
enter that country in those post Biafran war days when Americans were in 
disfavor with their government because of the many images being shown on our 
TVs of starving children in Biafra. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. My very 
passport listed Kano, Nigeria as my birthplace. In fact, representatives from 
the polling place in Chicago had come to my door at one point to check if I was 
a &ldquo;real citizen&rdquo; of the US after they noticed where I&rsquo;d been 
born. But for me, the pain was more than just not getting the visa. It was an 
absolute message that the land I loved so much, that I had always defended and 
felt so connected to saw me as &ldquo;one of them&rdquo;&hellip;an American! 
And that&rsquo;s all they saw&hellip;they couldn&rsquo;t see my heart.</p> 
<p>I was 39 before I knew there was language for my experience. By then we 
were living in Liberia. But even returning to Africa as an adult represented an 
unexpected challenge because now I was part of the official expat 
scene&hellip;not a child playing soccer with my peers. Now my peers were often 
others who had grown up in the States or other Western cultures and MY 
expectation of them was that they would see Africa through my eyes and I felt 
angry when they seemed critical. I never considered the different experiences 
in which we had grown up and how they had shaped us so differently. Perhaps we 
were hidden immigrants to each other!</p> 
<p>Ultimately, of course, I did some journaling to explore my story, it became 
my first book, Letters Never Sent, and I began hearing from adult TCKs around 
the world. I began to realize how different the details of our stories were, 
but how much the heart experience felt the same. And so that&rsquo;s why I like 
to work with others to spread the word of this topic today&hellip;to help us 
find some new &ldquo;normals&rdquo; for our culturally changing world.</p> 
<p>Which brings me to my final point&hellip;In reading Iyabo&rsquo;s story, I 
also noticed (and understood) the &ldquo;pathological implications&rdquo; in 
the term she has been using to identify herself - &quot;mixed kid 
schizophrenia&quot;.</p> 
<p>For me, as for her and many TCKs, before we have language for our 
experience, before we can use that language to explain ourselves to others, we 
simply wonder &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with me&rdquo; and our friends secretly 
wonder the same about us. Notice many of the current articles about Barack 
Obama wondering why he has such &ldquo;angst&rdquo; about his identity or the 
lead article in Newsweek magazine some years ago about Kobe Bryant, another 
TCK. The headlines on that cover said &ldquo;The troubled road of Kobe Bryant 
to rape charges.&rdquo; While I am not condoning any particular actions, the 
descriptions about Kobe&rsquo;s lack of social skills as a teenager in the 
States after his return at the age of 14 from growing up in Italy and countless 
other &ldquo;proofs&rdquo; of how he never quite fit were classic 
characteristics of the TCK Profile. I don&rsquo;t know if Kobe knows yet that 
he is far more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; than many have made him out to be.</p> 
<p>And that is the point. There is a vast host of people who share similar 
experiences but in the usual way of defining culture and 
&ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, they share nothing else. Their actions and reactions 
are evaluated through the lenses of the past.</p> 
<p>As the reality of how cultural mixing is changing our world and the 
individuals in it, perhaps we can begin to find new language and new 
&ldquo;normals&rdquo; so we can help ourselves and others realize 1) 
we&rsquo;re not as mixed up as it may appear! (there are good reasons for our 
responses and behaviors), 2) that for our experiences, there are some new 
normals, and 3) that as we accept these realities, the great gifts we have also 
been given by this rich upbringing can be expressed not only on an individual 
basis but also become part of an example in today&rsquo;s dividing world of how 
those who may appear vastly different outwardly can share deeply at some of the 
most foundational layers of their human experience.<br>

<p> Posted by: Ruth E. Van Reken | April 26, 2007 at 06:50 AM </p> <br>

<p>I was introduced to this website by Jeanette Maw. I am very excited to see 
academic language being used to describe what I have called &quot;mixed kid 
schizophrenia&quot; for many years. It puts a legitimate framework around my 
personal experiences that I just thought was my own unique, quirky experience. 
I am personally excited as to what Barack Obama and also Tiger Woods bring to 
the fore-front of the media. They just do not fit the mould!</p> 
<p>I am a bi-racial 42 year old attorney living here in the United States. My 
mother was half Irish American (third generation) and her father was Jewish of 
Polish descent. My father was from Lagos Nigeria and they met and got married 
in New York City in 1952. They then moved to Nigeria where my mother lived for 
33 years. I was born and raised in Nigeria and I came to the U.S. when I was 16 
to attend college. I attended a small all-women&rsquo;s college in Maryland 
which only had about 1,100 students. The international body of students were 
predominantly from South America and due to the language barrier, I found it 
very difficult to fit in with that group.</p> 
<p>The African-American women in college really supported me and reached out 
to me. Thus, I began to assimilate into the African-American lifestyle. Most of 
my friends were African-American. I could relate more to African-Americans 
because they were so open to me. I also had an insatiable thirst for 
African-American classical literature. When I went to law school, I had the 
same experience with African-American. I have two older siblings and their 
experiences were very different from mine as they were in much larger 
institutions of learning and the international body was very diverse. They 
never had the African American experience that I had.</p> 
<p>After law school, I moved to Atlanta, Georgia where my law practice has 
been heavily supported by African Americans. However, in my mid thirties, as I 
began to focus less on my professional desires and more on my personal desires. 
Increasingly, I became aware that I had turned my back, so to say, on my 
African background. I spoke Yoruba, my Nigerian language, but I found it 
difficult to assimilate fully with Nigerians. I certainly felt that I did not 
have a chance to assimilate with White Americans either. Most people, 
immediately assume that I am African-American and put me in &ldquo;that&rdquo; 
box. As grateful as I continue to feel to the African-American community as a 
group for accepting me and bringing me into the sheepfold, I admit it is not a 
complete fit. I do not have a complete sense of belonging with 
African-Americans as a whole.</p> 
<p>Growing up in Nigeria, I was considered &ldquo;white.&rdquo; An 
overwhelming majority of the population were pure black Africans. Therefore, as 
my skin was very fair compared to everyone else, I was considered 
&ldquo;white.&rdquo; This did not mean that I was superior, just different. It 
was merely a description of my skin tone, not a cultural or racial 
identification. However, my parents were very protective of us physically and 
we did not grow up totally assimilated into Nigerian culture.</p> 
<p>I believe they were protective of us because they raised us in a 
non-typical Nigerian manner and they knew we would have a difficult time 
assimilating into the local culture. We were told from early childhood that we 
were from two cultures and we should pick the best values out of both and 
create a personal value system that reflected the best of both worlds. When my 
parents talked about their differences, it was never really about race, it was 
about different cultures and different countries. My parents were non-religious 
people but they held a very strong positive value system.</p> 
<p><br>
 I have lived in the U.S. now for 26 years. I still feel like an 
outsider. I find that race defines so much in this country. This is such a 
foreign concept to me. If I see you and the first thing I notice is your race 
and I make assumptions about you, then I may never really get to know you. 
However, if I begin to talk to you and ask you about your background so that I 
can put you into a cultural group, I may do a little better in getting to know 
you before I make a judgment about you. But ideally for me, if I just take the 
time to know you, then I discover your personhood which transcends your culture 
and your race and I get to see you for yourself, not your culture and not your 
race.</p> 
<p>However, the truth is that with our increasing east to access information, 
travel and knowledge, most people are having third culture experiences on some 
scale. If you move from Atlanta to New York, you will doubtlessly encounter 
some &ldquo;culture shock.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>My experience of &quot;mixed kid schizophrenia&quot; is curling up to 
enjoying Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; one evening and the next morning, 
I want to master the intricacies of the proper pronunciation of a very complex 
Yoruba proverb that &Agrave;gb&egrave;&#803; &ograve; d&aacute;&#7779;&#7885; 
l&oacute;&#7779;&ugrave;, &agrave;f&#7885;d&uacute;n which means A farmer does 
not make new clothes monthly, only annually, which contextually translates into 
&ldquo;The reward for one's labor is often a long time coming.&rdquo; (I 
promise you, my Yoruba is not that good, I merely have an insatiable thirst for 
it.)</p> 
<p>It feels schizophrenic because one part of my brain, personality, tastes, 
thinking, and perception belongs to this very American life that I live and the 
other part craves for a basic life of idyllic peace and security that I grew up 
with. I do feel lonely in this country as I feel very disconnected &ldquo;from 
whence I came&rdquo; and also because it has taken very hard work on my part to 
consciously create multi-dimensional relationships with Nigerians, 
Nigerian-Americans, white Americans, African-Americans, Europeans and other 
Africans as well.</p> 
<p>I hope this contributes constructively to this discussion. </p>
