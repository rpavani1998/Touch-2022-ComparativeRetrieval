<ul> 
<li>  We support life without school, diversity of perspective, choice, the 
family and the child. No one blog, not even this LWOS blog, can possibly 
represent the opinions and lives of all who live life without school. Each blog 
does, however, in some small way represent one life, one family, once voice, 
one lifestyle out of many who choose to live life without school.</li> </ul>

<h3>Imperfect Homeschooling</h3> 
<p>By Marsha</p> 
<p>Recently there was a discussion on an e-list I subscribe to about why 
homeschooled kids don&rsquo;t always turn out &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.&nbsp; In 
light of another discussion recently where a homeschool mother was requesting 
tips because she was going to write a book to help families figure out the 
perfect way to homeschool, this discussion resonated with me.</p> 
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the fact that homeschooled adults aren&rsquo;t perfect, likely 
related to the fact that most homeschooling families aren&rsquo;t perfect, 
because the members, including dad and mom aren&rsquo;t perfect?&nbsp; 
Ain&rsquo;t that a shocker to admit?&nbsp; While I personally don&rsquo;t know 
any homeschooled kids who have turned out so terribly bad, it stands to reason 
that with homeschooling families being a microcosm of our society in general, 
and individuals having free will, some homeschooled adults will choose things 
that go totally against the way they were raised.&nbsp; If we look around at 
the imperfect world we live in and all the pressures of the society we live in, 
we really can&rsquo;t be that surprised, can we?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a fallacy for parents (homeschooling or not) to take 
credit for our adult children&rsquo;s successes or failures.&nbsp; We do the 
best we can in an imperfect world, to raise them with the values we cherish, 
and then they make their gradual way out into the world to make their own 
choices.&nbsp; Our hearts rejoice when they choose wisely and when life is good 
to them (sometimes as a direct result of their choices but sometimes no thanks 
to them) and we grieve and yearn over them when they don&rsquo;t choose wisely, 
or when life knocks them down again and again.&nbsp; However, much as 
we&rsquo;d like to take credit for their success, it&rsquo;s not really ours to 
own.&nbsp; And likewise, when our kids (adults, but yes, still our kids, in our 
hearts) choose horribly and end up in the ditch and either don&rsquo;t choose 
to or find themselves unable to crawl back out again, we really shouldn&rsquo;t 
beat ourselves up for it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I used to arrogantly think that when adult kids made rotten choices, their 
parents must have failed horribly in some way.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t believe 
that any more.&nbsp; That may be true in some cases, but it&rsquo;s been proven 
over and over and over to me that sometimes no matter how wonderfully kids are 
parented (and homeschooled) they don&rsquo;t always turn out that well.&nbsp; 
(And how many families do you know who have several children that turned out 
wonderfully well, and then there&rsquo;s that one that just turned out 
terrible?&nbsp; Same parents, same environment, different kid). . . .</p> 
<p>My uncle told me when I was pregnant with #1 that children aren&rsquo;t 
blank slates that we can write on and have them turn out like we want them 
to.&nbsp; I thought at the time that he was wrong.&nbsp; But having four 
children (three grown and one sixteen), I can affirm that they aren&rsquo;t 
blank slates when they are born.&nbsp; They come complete with their own little 
personalities.&nbsp; We may manage to mold and shape them to some extent, but 
the fact remains that they have free will.&nbsp; They can disregard our 
teachings totally some day.&nbsp; Many don&rsquo;t, but some do.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As parents we can only do the best we can with what we know at the time and 
keep doing the best we can all along the way.&nbsp; Sometimes we learn things 
that make us realize we could have done something differently in the past, but 
it&rsquo;s too late to relive our lives.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t happen.&nbsp;<br>

It&rsquo;s never too late, however, whether our kids are four, ten or 
thirty-four, to tell them we love them, to admit we&rsquo;re human and we have 
made mistakes, and to try to do better in the future.&nbsp; This is a wonderful 
healing thing to do no matter what age our kids . . .</p>

<h3>Life With Out A Formal Education: Living Teachable Moments</h3> 
<p>By Robin</p> 
<p>While the public schools are preparing children for NCLB testing by 
teaching to pre-determined learning objectives and benchmarking progress at 
pre-set intervals with carefully calculated pacing guides (did I get that 
right?), we are&hellip;..not. We are not scouring the NCLB standards listings 
of what our children should be learning. We are not planning or performing to a 
set boxed &ldquo;make it happen this way, today&rdquo; curriculum. We are not 
creating detailed learning objectives that must be met, now or never. We are 
not anxiously marking our children&rsquo;s &ldquo;progress&rdquo; with 
incremental steps that are supposed to lead to a prescribed learning jackpot 
called &ldquo;success.&rdquo; We are, however, preparing our children for life, 
and we are so very happy to be doing that without a formal education.</p> 
<p>My son would be in kindergarten this year if in a traditional school 
setting, and my daughter would be in third grade. If they were in school this 
past month of November 2006, they would have been instructed in some of the 
following as determined by the school system and would have been expected to 
learn it this November 2006.<em>&ldquo;Objectives are placed in the quarter in 
which mastery should be expected.&rdquo;</em> They would be tested on these 
objectives, pass or fail, and then they would move on and away to the next 
predetermined set of objectives:Third Grade Pacing Guide. </p> 
<p>If they did not pass the tests that supposedly prove that they are learning 
this stuff and that supposedly prove how much they are learning, they might be 
labeled failures, unsatisfactory, below average, learning disabled, 
unmotivated, careless, unsuccessful, and so on. If they &ldquo;proved&rdquo; 
that they are learning this stuff, they might be considered excellent, 
motivated, average, above average, gifted, motivated, attentive, successful, 
and so on.</p> 
<p>Why? Why label a child &ldquo;good or bad&rdquo; based on school 
performance? Why go to all that trouble to make a child fit a curriculum, a set 
of standards defined by targeted (thus limited) detailed learning objectives 
when the end result is a label, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;? Why teach 
a child that her self worth is wrapped up in performance at all, and especially 
to faulty and invalid measures of real learning?</p> 
<p>This past November 2006, my children were (and still are) learning about 
dogs because we just brought our new dog, Sophie, home to be in our family. We 
were told by the dog and cat rescue organization that we adopted her from that 
she is German Shepherd mix, part Lab. The trainer that we are taking classes 
from said Lab mix, part Rottweiler, and the mystery of &quot;what is 
Sophie&quot; is taking us to tons of information and on a real life learning 
experience and a critical thinking extravaganza.</p> 
<p>Do you know how excited my children are? They are e-x-c-i-t-e-d! Do you 
know how much they want to learn about this dog named, Sophie? Whatbreeds is 
she and what might that mean? Where does she come from? How, why and where did 
her breeds &ldquo;evolve?&rdquo; Why does she behave as she does and how do we 
train her (lots ofclassical/operant conditioning here and logical thinking in 
that one)? How do wecare for her? What does she need from us? We are reading 
dog poems, dog stories, dog myths and legends. We are researching how to care 
for her and applying that information in real life. We are taking a dog 
training course. We are testing out behavior modification theory and taking 
note of dog and people psychology.</p> 
<p>Sophie came into our lives and our lives are now about learning about 
Sophie. My children are personally invested in learning about this dog. They 
know and own their own &ldquo;need to know,&rdquo; and they feel directly 
empowered when they delve into that personal energy and learn in it. They enjoy 
the learning. The learning is a direct primary reinforcement. The satisfaction 
of the &quot;know&quot; surpasses any &quot;superior grade&quot; in quality of 
experience. The learning itself is<em>worth it</em> because it is relevant, 
wanted and needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>John Dewey, a renowned educational philosopher and proponent of the modern 
public education movement believed in the power of what he called, &ldquo;
teachable moments.&quot; The MSN Encarta Dictionary defines a teachable moment 
as &quot;a time at which a person, especially a child, is likely to be 
particularly disposed to learn something or particularly responsive to being 
taught or made aware of something.&quot; A teachable moment is when life and 
person meet with the desire to know.</p> 
<p>We are living those teachable moments by living our lives and learning as 
we go. We are learning together and with friends, family and just folks we meet 
at the library, the pet store, the grocery store and so on, and then there are 
our fellow students in dog training class. People like to talk about dogs! We 
are having an on-going learning conversation with each other and these people 
who are a part of our lives.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A dog splurge,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;does not an education 
make.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>OK. A dog splurge does not make an education complete, and we were learning 
more than about Sophie these past November days. Life takes care of the 
content. We live our teachable moments when we are actively engaged in our own 
lives!</p> 
<p>When my daughter was 5, I registered her for school. I received a packet 
that contained learning objectives already defined for her for the next five 
years of her life. I backed out (another story) and convinced my husband for a 
trial year of homeschooling. He agreed to it if I would assure him that we 
would cover those objectives. One day as I hedged along, I asked him if he was 
sure that we had to cover Betsy Ross specifically that year. By that time, he 
had begun to see things a little differently. He had begun to see the real live 
&ldquo;learn as we go&rdquo; learning and to value it. &ldquo;Just make sure 
you introduce some history (any history),&rdquo; he said. And we did, and we do.
</p> 
<p>From our past American girl excursion to our more recent Magic Tree house 
adventures (we plunder the library for myths and legends, stories, poetry, 
cooking and craft books, and informational books and dive into the culture and 
time) to visits to local living&nbsp; museums and working historical farms in 
character (my children like to dress up and participate) to travels from the 
beginning of time (my children are into early human and the evolution of humans 
and animals big time) to making history today by voting, meeting the governor 
of our state and making the world a better place today as we see it (my 
children are into protecting animals and making sure they do not go extinct), 
we are &ldquo;covering&rdquo; and making history. We also &ldquo;cover&rdquo; 
our science, our math, our geography, and our language arts in a similar 
fashion. We get involved in life and pursue it.</p> 
<p>This November 2006 ended with the four of us sick, hanging out on the sofa 
and watching quite a bit of of TV (National Geographic, The Food Network, and 
Animal Planet), learning quite a bit about dogs (We just found outSophie has 
Giardia probably from drinking from the creek or from the 
soil?&hellip;how&rsquo;s that?...what do we do?....yuck...), talking about 
white blood cells, making stats sheets on pro football teams, and learninghow 
to make chicken soup 3 different ways off of one chicken. </p> 
<p>Living out our &quot;teachable moments&quot; gives us a direct connection 
to the learning that&nbsp; lives in life, our lives. It gives us the joy and 
thrill that belongs to our own authentic experience and the power to be 
self-determined. It works. We are creating our own learning objectives as we 
go. We are creating our own personal goals and living them out, and we are 
empowered by our own independence to change our direction and our goals when 
they no longer serve us. There is no way to pre-determine this kind of 
learning. You can&rsquo;t NCLB it, and if you tried, you would basically 
destroy it.</p>

<h3>Success or Failure?</h3> 
<p>By Cindy</p> 
<p>I ended my last post about my oldest son, Eric's, first experience with 
formal education through a dual-enrollment community college program.&nbsp; He 
had taken two courses with very different instructors and expectations for what 
made up his end grade.&nbsp; Eric had brought his unschooling perspective into 
the classroom with him and did well with a professor whose grading recognized 
and reflected the real learning that occurred within the confines of my son's 
mind.&nbsp; He didn't score as well with the traditional professor and the 
traditional grading expectations that simply reflected the hoops he was meant 
to jump through versus the learning that was accomplished.&nbsp; Eric was at a 
crossroads for his learning path.&nbsp; Now was the time for him to conform to 
the rule-driven structure of a formalized education in order to meet his goals, 
right?&nbsp; Not Eric.&nbsp; His conclusion:&nbsp; Well, until I'm ready to 
play by their rules, I'm not going to take college classes.&nbsp; And, he 
hasn't been back since (being 16 years old at the time), and he's approaching 
20 years old.&nbsp; So, what is this considered?&nbsp; An unschooling 
failure?&nbsp; And yet, Eric was simply remaining true to what real learning is 
and embracing the learning environment and perspective we created for him.</p> 
<p>After thinking through this scenario and observing Eric's subsequent 
learning path, I realized that there were a couple things that I was to learn 
for myself on my own learning journey with my adult-transitioning 
children.&nbsp; One is that I would continue to have to question and scrutinize 
the conditioned responses and expectations I hold from our societal and 
cultural surroundings regarding finding one's own pathway to adulthood.&nbsp; 
Because we have never pushed our children through the typical schooling 
line-up:&nbsp; preschool, elementary, junior high, high school, college, each 
child has had to figure out on an individual basis what and how and why they 
want to learn.&nbsp; Most schooled children blindly enter college because it is 
what is expected of them.&nbsp; One of several things will result:&nbsp; a 
small percentage will discover they love it and find what they really want to 
do with their life; the greater majority will either continue to pursue what is 
expected of them and later discover they hate their life or they will flit 
through their college experience and land in something they may or may not 
like.&nbsp; I'm sure there are other outcomes, but it appears that 
statistically speaking, it is unlikely a person will find their love and 
passion in traditional schooling practices, but instead, simply continue the 
blind path they have always followed.&nbsp; That can be following a parent's 
dreams or expectations, reaching for society's golden ticket of money or fame 
or prestige, or taking the easiest path that presents itself.</p> 
<p>Eric is showing me that he will need time to figure out what he wants to do 
and how he wants to do it.&nbsp; Initially, he has not been willing to 
compromise the learning principles, environment, and support from which he has 
become accustomed through the unschooling lifestyle.&nbsp; I rememberPeter 
Kowalke, the &quot;Homeschooler in College&quot; columnist for Home Education 
Magazine going through a similar discovery process.&nbsp; He actually started 
attending a respected college, &quot;proof&quot; that unschooling works, 
right?&nbsp; And then, he had to start being honest with himself about how 
unhappy he was jumping through these random hoops created in college 
coursework.&nbsp; Peter decided to drop out and see if he could uncollege and 
encourage others to explore the option.&nbsp; After about a year in the 
learning curve, Peter decided he had to &quot;bite the bullet&quot; and 
complete university in order to effect real change from a different 
angle.&nbsp; Some could say at different points of Peter's journey that 
&quot;this was a failure&quot; or &quot;that was a success&quot;.&nbsp; I don't 
think Peter or Eric think about it in that manner.&nbsp; It was simply a 
journey they needed to take in order to make a mindful decision about what path 
to take to reach their goals.&nbsp; Eric's future may or may not include 
university matriculation, but I do know whatever he chooses will have been done 
consciously and with his eyes wide open.&nbsp; My job is to trust the process 
while stretching the thoughts and reactions that society's expectations for 
this age at this stage in this generation face.&nbsp; It is my belief that he 
will end up choosing his own path versus letting the path choose for him.</p> 
<p>This does not mean that Eric has been doing &quot;nothing&quot; since 16, 
although sometimes it can appear that way from the outside looking in.&nbsp; At 
17, Eric took his first part-time job.&nbsp; At 18, he added another part-time 
job with more meaning (and money) and dropped the first one.&nbsp; Eric sought 
these part-time jobs because he wanted the benefit of pursuing diverse 
interests during the other part of his available time that required the 
necessity of financial backing.&nbsp; With his earnings, at 18 he fulfilled an 
adolescent goal of living in Japan with a host family for two months.&nbsp; 
Afterward, Eric dabbled in costuming and other legitimate art pursuits.&nbsp; 
During this time, he began to investigate private fine arts colleges across the 
nation that might have majors in his area of current interest, what would be 
expected, and what the financial obligation would require.&nbsp; Eric began a 
more serious portfolio collection of his work.&nbsp; Although at close to 20 
his interest in college has become more peaked toward a Japanese history major 
with a leaning toward UCLA because of a free martial arts program there, he 
feels he needs one more significant life experience before committing to a life 
path.&nbsp; Therefore, Eric set his sites on preparing himself for serving a 
two year mission for our church.&nbsp; He has had his starts and stops in this 
area, and learned an enormous amount about himself emotionally, and is now 
eager to leave in mid-January to begin the pursuit of meeting this goal and 
embracing all that it offers him in learning and growth.</p> 
<p>Is creating your own path viable?&nbsp; Can one find happiness and 
independence using the more organic path to learning?&nbsp; Eric would 
certainly be the one to show me.&nbsp; And what about success and failure 
against which we often measure all of our actions?&nbsp; Isn't life a journey 
made up of many processes that accumulate into life lessons and 
experiences?&nbsp; Won't each of us on our individual journeys have what we 
might consider failures?&nbsp; Won't each of us on our individual journeys have 
what we might consider successes?&nbsp; Who determines what category each 
falls?&nbsp; Do these not accumulate to create wisdom through living and 
learning?&nbsp; What I'm understanding is that I don't get to define or own any 
of my children's successes or failures.&nbsp; Neither does the homeschooling 
community.&nbsp; It is for each of us to own our individual journeys and 
everything in it that develops who we are through living and learning.&nbsp; I 
release my judgments and my ownership while I continue to support and counsel 
Eric on his journey through life to joy.</p>

<h3>Self-Directed Learners</h3> 
<p>By Marsha</p> 
<p>Quite often when children experience difficulties in school, it's because 
of a bad fit.&nbsp; I called it the &quot;square peg in a round hole&quot; 
syndrome.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your child has a unique learning style, or learning 
differences, it's easy for him or her to fall behind if left in a typical 
classroom setting.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even kids with some identified learning 
disabilities have been found to thrive in a homeschooling environment.&nbsp; By 
spending time working one-on-one with your child, getting to know the way your 
child learns so you can make their learning program fit, and planning learning 
experiences to fit your child, you can give them that extra boost that they 
need to excel.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many, many people are beginning to homeschool these 
days to provide their children with a personalized education that will help 
them to become happy, motivated, excited learners.&nbsp; Too many children have 
the mistaken impression that we only learn to get a certain grade or for a 
certain class.&nbsp; &nbsp;Developing a love of learning in your child is a 
gift beyond compare, one that will continue to reap benefits as your child 
pursues higher education, and a career.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can impart a love 
and a zest for learning, you will have done your child an irreplaceable 
service.&nbsp; How can you do that?&nbsp; &nbsp;One way is to help your child 
become an independent learner instead of a passive learner.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with the illustrations in my book, <em>The Complete 
Idiot&rsquo;s Guide to Homeschooling</em>, chapters 10 through 13?&nbsp; 
Answer&nbsp; They show passive learners!!!</p> 
<p>Each of the children shown is sitting quietly at their desk, hands folded, 
waiting for someone to tell them what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and 
so on.&nbsp; While this may be a somewhat important skill for kids to develop 
in a large classroom setting, truly gifted teachers do things that make kids 
want to be ready to learn when the teacher walks in the door.&nbsp; And 
likewise, homeschooling parents are overjoyed when their child gets to work of 
their own volition.&nbsp; While we certainly are prepared to spend a certain 
amount of time with our children, helping them with their learning activities, 
we are thrilled when the kids take off and run with their studies because they 
want to learn more, because they are excited about the project,or the topic at 
hand.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let's learn about some more famous women who were homeschooled and 
determine what we can learn from their experiences.</p> 
<p>Pearl Buck, an American writer, daughter of missionary parents in China, 
who was taught by her mother and a Chinese tutor.&nbsp; She didn't start formal 
schooling until the age of 17.&nbsp; The thing that stood out to me the most 
about Pearl Buck was her immersion in the Chinese culture, her interaction with 
her Chinese nanny, and other household staff, which led her to an understanding 
and respect of their culture which shines through in her writings.&nbsp; From 
this example as well as our own experience with international adoption, has 
come a desire to provide a multi-cultural worldview for our homeschool.&nbsp; 
We cook foods from a variety of cultures, and often begin our unit studies by 
learning about a particular country or culture.&nbsp; Jacinta's studies one 
year were based on the American Girl books, the Josefina series.&nbsp; We 
learned how New Mexico became a state and Jacinta sewed herself clothes just 
like Josefina's.&nbsp; She learned to weave on a little loom, and had a Mexican 
themed birthday party.&nbsp; She cooked all the food herself, including 
biscochitos, tamales, and other treats.&nbsp; Another year, we explored the 
traditions of her birth country and had a Korean birthday party.&nbsp; Jacinta 
had attended Heritage Camp for the first time and was excited to share the 
Korean national song with her friends, as well as teaching them how to bow and 
hold a fan.&nbsp; In recent years, Jacinta has worked as a volunteer in the 
Multi-Cultural preschool at Heritage Camp, allowing her to learn about many 
cultures other than her own.</p> 
<p>Jill Kerr Conway, former president of Smith College, was raised on a sheep 
station in Australia and learned from life and correspondence lessons that she 
began at the age of eight.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read the book and found it 
fascinating.&nbsp; &nbsp;PBS put out a 90 minute film on May 13, 2002, telling 
the extraordinary story of Ms. Conway's coming of age, from the windswept 
Australian outback to the stately halls of academia - a journey of 
determination and courage.&nbsp; I was able to get online teachers' guides at 
pbs.org/masterpiece.&nbsp; A friend of mine taped it for me; maybe it&rsquo;s 
available otherwise by now.</p> 
<p>To sum up, key factors to developing successful self-directed learners may 
include some of the following:</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Interaction with adults</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Focused attention from 
parents, and/or siblings/tutors/mentors</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Apprenticeships</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Real jobs</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Access to good books and a 
love of reading</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Writing;&nbsp; keeping a 
journal, creative writing, record-keeping</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learning at their own pace
</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understanding the 
contribution of all cultures</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Immersion learning or 
learning from life and things around them</p> 
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Interest-based learning</p> 
<p>I like what Lisa Rivero,&nbsp; a writer, home school parent, and&nbsp; 
gifted education and homeschooling advocate wrote&nbsp; &quot;Self-directed 
learning is an educational philosophy that emphasizes the child's role as an 
active learner.&nbsp; Self-directed learning is very different from a 
traditional model of learning that has teachers and other adults deciding what 
will be learned, when it will be learned, how it will be learned, and whether 
it was learned.&nbsp; Students can be self-directed in several ways and in 
different degrees.</p> 
<p>Children are self-directed whenever they decide what they need or want to 
learn,&nbsp; set their own goals, identify and find resources for learning, 
choose and use strategies for learning, or&nbsp; evaluate their own 
learning.&quot;</p> 
<p>As teachers, mentors, and homeschooling parents, we can encourage and 
develop self-direction in children by including them in planning their learning 
experiences,&nbsp; having them choose materials they will use, and 
understanding their learning style so we can support them along their learning 
journey.&nbsp; It's amazing how much more readily kids will learn when they are 
interested in the subject, as opposed to learning the same topic when it's our 
idea.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How can we best support our children as they develop into self-directed 
learners?&nbsp; &nbsp;What can we do if our children are passive learners and 
don't give us many clues?&nbsp; How can we get to know what our kids are 
interested in?</p> 
<p>We can plant seeds by making suggestions, planning field trips, or reading 
together from books that we feel will spark an interest. If the things we plan 
are enjoyable, interesting, and fun, the chance of&nbsp; our child wanting to 
learn more is increased.&nbsp; &nbsp;I often leave books on the library shelf 
or the coffee table in our living room.&nbsp; Sometimes I suggest that my kids 
begin to read a book, just to see if they like it.&nbsp; Often, things that we 
do, such as visits to museums or historical sites, will begin a new phase in 
our child's learning experience.&nbsp; We can also intentionally plan projects 
and learning experiences to build on a known interest.&nbsp; When I am aware of 
a child having a particular interest, I will find as many ways to encourage 
continued research and growth in that area.&nbsp; That's why our trip to CA has 
included visits to the ocean, Sea World, and will include trips to the San 
Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park.&nbsp; The ocean and animals are deep-seated 
interests of my daughter Jacinta.&nbsp; I wish I could tell you that our trip 
to Knott's is inspired by my son's love of California history, but I'm afraid 
it's the rides that are calling to him!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Self-directed learners 
don't have to be dropped into a chasm of parental indifference or disinterest; 
on the contrary, it's really just a paradigm shift from parent-directed to 
parent-supported education.&nbsp; And that shift can often make a world of 
difference in the child's attitude toward learning.</p>

<h3>Refusing to Feed the Frenzy</h3> 
<p>By Shay</p> 
<p>On &ldquo;Black Friday,&rdquo; the day after Thanksgiving, I participated in
Buy Nothing Day, which has become my tradition. A friend, who had braved the 
shopping chaos, said that the local outlet mall (&ldquo;Virginia&rsquo;s Number 
One Tourist Attraction!&rdquo;) was so packed with gift-seekers that parking 
overflowed to outlying lots, and that it was &ldquo;a zoo out there!&quot;</p> 
<p>Instead of wending my way through ravenous throngs and standing in 
interminable lines that day, I enjoyed the lovely seventy-degree weather, 
hanging laundry on the line, and going on an extra-long bicycle ride. I 
relished the feel of sun and breeze, knowing it will not be long before 
winter's glum visage stares us down for seemingly endless months. These moments 
of satisfaction are a hallmark of having successfully &ldquo;unplugged&rdquo; 
the &ldquo;Christmas Machine.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I began lobbying my family to turn down the holiday volume about eight 
years ago, when the number of grandchildren and gifts given had turned 
Christmas Eve at my father&rsquo;s house into an hours-long materialistic 
feeding frenzy. Like a friend once noted about her family&rsquo;s celebration, 
we &ldquo;could not see the Christmas tree for the trash around it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>At first, my children and I were only able to identify what we did not like 
about the holiday madness, but we were not sure exactly what we wanted to keep. 
As a first step toward a more satisfying holiday season, I purchased copies of 
&quot;Unplug the Christmas Machine&quot; and &quot;New Traditions,&quot; books 
that helped my family define how we do want to celebrate. We noted that the 
number one thing that makes the season special for us is spending time with 
loved ones. Also scoring high was feeling relaxed in a calm atmosphere. We also 
like doing a few simple and meaningful things together, like baking one or two 
kinds of heirloom cookies to give to friends and neighbors, taking walks to see 
the lights at night, and decorating simply, with candles, evergreen branches, 
and a small tree. We might also donate some goodies to the animal shelter bake 
sale, learn a new song, or go to a friend's sing-along.</p> 
<p>Gift giving did not disappear, but we downplay the focus on material 
things. The children find stocking stuffers and candy in their stockings, and a 
few gifts under our little tree. When we open gifts, we do it over a long 
course, so we can take time to fully appreciate each one.</p> 
<p>These changes were initially not well received among the extended family, 
but after a few years, the aunts, uncles, and grandparents stopped insisting on 
giving my children Pound Puppies&mdash;or whatever was 
&ldquo;in&rdquo;&mdash;regardless of my daughters&rsquo; interests. The 
&ldquo;reciprocity guilt&rdquo; bothered me at first, but eased as I saw the 
effects of standing my ground, watching the material tide ebb. Indeed, one of 
the best things about unplugging the holidays is being emancipated from 
standing in the department store&rsquo;s return line on December 26th. I still 
remember how free I felt the first time I was able to stay home with my family 
instead of going through the cattle chute with other grumpy post-Christmas 
reverse shoppers.</p> 
<p>My children, now 16 and 13, have repeatedly expressed pleasure at our 
having opted out of perpetuating the cycle of insatiable material gluttony that 
defines the holiday season for numerous Americans. They appreciate that the 
holiday season no longer brings stress and strain to our home, right through to 
the gift aftermath and emotional letdown. Instead, we are serenely enjoying<em>
not</em> mall hopping, <em>not </em>lining up with the unhappy multitudes, <em>
not</em> being constantly barraged with the same music ad nauseum, <em>not</em> 
worrying about finding &ldquo;just the right gift&rdquo; for the person who 
already has more than enough,<em>not</em> worrying about how much to spend on 
whom,<em>not </em>wondering if the children&rsquo;s concept of the reason for 
the season is a glut of new stuff,<em>not </em>worrying how we will find room 
for a flood of new belongings, not stressing over how to pay for it all, and<em>
not</em>planning to get up early the day after Christmas to stand in line with 
packs of other people who are glumly returning the junk they didn't want or 
need.</p> 
<p>My family's holiday activities are now low key, keeping our observances 
simple and meaningful. We spend little, stress none, and find great 
satisfaction.Stepping back from the holiday feeding frenzy is one of the most 
subversive actions a family can take. Since beginning this move toward sanity, 
we have seen our steps repeated by others, and now have a small circle of 
friends and family members who have also chosen to back away from a stressful, 
harried, and cheapened holiday season. One never knows what small act may plant 
the seeds of a revolution.</p>

<h3>House of Tomorrow</h3> 
<p>By Shay</p> 
<p><em>&quot;You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have 
their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their 
souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your 
dreams.&rdquo;</em> -Kahlil Gibran</p> 
<p>When my firstborn was very young, I pounced on each &ldquo;learning 
moment,&rdquo; overly eager to make sure my daughter received every possible 
kind of support and encouragement for learning. If she showed even the tiniest 
interest in a subject, creature, object, or concept, I rushed in with 
resources, manipulatives, books, toys, games, and real life objects.
Caitl&iacute;n was the only 3-year-old in her playgroup who had her own toolbox 
with real tools, an extra large set ofCuisenaire Rods, or a chess set. Still, 
my daughter, and her younger sister, Laurel, did not latch on to any particular 
interest, although children all around us were doing so.</p> 
<p>The sons of a friend displayed early and avid interest in baseball. I 
recall one very young boy bringing aDuplo bricks board to his mother, on which 
he had placed bricks to make two squares abutting each other. &ldquo;Oh, I see 
you made the number eight,&rdquo; the mom said to her son, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s 
Cal Ripkin&rsquo;s number.&rdquo; I felt grateful that my children were not 
into baseball, especially to that degree. I would not want to have to fake 
interest in my children&rsquo;s interests, and that would be the case with 
baseball, or most any team sport. Nevertheless, I wanted my kids to have 
interests. It seemed the natural, normal thing.</p> 
<p>Having read David Albert&rsquo;s &ldquo;And the Skylark Sings With Me
,&rdquo; which includes stories about his children&rsquo;s amazing interests 
and their ingenuity and drive in following them (Building a huge telescope! 
Picking up the violin at an early age! Playing the violin to earn money to buy 
another violin! Trekking into the wilderness to study wild wolves!), I was 
anxious for my own children to display<em>some</em> kind of steady interest. 
They didn&rsquo;t have to be prodigies, mind you, just demonstrate that they 
were, indeed, learning, and that they were, indeed, becoming themselves. I was 
so desperate for them to have something with which to identify that I might 
have even breathed a sigh of relief had they chosen baseball.</p> 
<p>During those early years, I spent a lot of time and money buying every 
imaginable educational tool to support my daughters&rsquo; vague leanings. Most 
of these books, magazines, toys, manipulatives, games, and other resources have 
been disposed of&mdash;sold, given away, or donated toVaHomeschoolers&rsquo; 
Used Resource Sale&mdash;having never captured my children&rsquo;s interest. 
Fortunately, I do learn, eventually. I long since backed off on buying things 
for my children without their explicit request.</p> 
<p>Very gradually, Caitl&iacute;n and Laurel developed interests in history, 
theatre, English literature, and the cinema. Now, at 16 and 13 years of age, 
they produce a biweekly e-zine, called &ldquo;<em>The Talisman</em>,&rdquo; 
that includes their book and movie reviews, plus poems, how-to&rsquo;s, polls, 
quotes, and more. They played Captain Smollett and Mrs. Hawkins, respectively, 
in Homeschool Theatre Troupe&rsquo;s recent rendition of &ldquo;Treasure Island
.&rdquo; The older girl has decided that&mdash;despite her teenager&rsquo;s 
inclination to reject any resemblance to her mother&mdash;she likes sailing, 
and she is currently reading her way through the Horatio Hornblower novels. 
After the girls viewed four borrowed tapes of theA&amp;E 
&ldquo;Hornblower&rdquo; series, my younger daughter insisted that I purchase 
the eight-DVD set with her money. The girls watched them raptly, declaring them 
&ldquo;brilliant.&rdquo; A couple of weeks ago, Laurel, the thirteen-year-old, 
noted matter-of-factly that she had just finished reading the unabridged &ldquo;
<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>,&rdquo; and today added that she has since then 
read &ldquo;<em>Sense and Sensibility</em>,&rdquo; and plans to read &ldquo;<em>
Emma</em>&rdquo; soon. Both of my children are avid readers and writers, 
keeping daily journals, corresponding with several pen pals, creating mock 
movie trailers in PowerPoint, editing my writing, and making regular requests 
to go to the library for yet more books.</p> 
<p>My girls have clear interests now, but being teens, they also demand a 
great deal of privacy. They made it known that I am privileged to be on their 
list of recipients of &ldquo;<em>The Talisman</em>,&rdquo; howl in protest if I 
come into the room while they are writing, and they shoo me away from their 
theatre rehearsals, refusing to even let me hear their audition monologs. While 
I do have a general sense of what they are learning, and what they know, their 
educational journeys are largely hidden from me.</p> 
<p>When writing about my children&rsquo;s education, I search for that 
anecdotal evidence that learning happens&mdash;a task that is frustrated by my 
daughters&rsquo; need for privacy, for their need of identities separate from 
my own. Therefore, I am making the conscious choice to back off, to allow them 
to just be who they are. After learning from them for sixteen years, I have 
finally dropped the idea that I need to examine and explain these girls, and 
let go of the idea that I must hold them up as proof that I made the right 
educational choices for them. At last, I can allow each of them complete 
freedom in building her own &ldquo;house of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Zen and the Art of Homeschooling</h3> 
<p>By Tammy</p> 
<p>By far, the most important element of preparing our children for their 
future is to teach them how to learn. No matter what specific facts or skills 
we teach them, so long as they have the ability and confidence to learn, they 
are prepared for any path they choose.</p> 
<p>And, if we teach our children how to learn, they will naturally gravitate 
towards the things that they &ldquo;get&rdquo; and enjoy, which I think is also 
an important skill &ndash; knowing what our purpose is by understanding who we 
are, what we like, and what we&rsquo;re good at.</p> 
<p>I studied Spanish in school for seven years, growing up. When I graduated 
high school, I still couldn't keep a conversation going in the language. But I 
understood HOW the language worked. Not because I studied it for 7 years. I 
understood how it worked because it made sense to me. I 'got&quot; language 
from the very first week I was in Spanish class. That is why I kept studying it 
for so many years. It was easy for me. It was something that felt good to 
pursue. My brain and language have always been good companions. When I went to 
college, I switched to French in my junior year. I never said one word of 
French in my life before that time. But I picked it up immediately, went on to 
get my MA in French, and taught at the university for 3 years. Language made 
sense to me.</p> 
<p>All of this I did without any early childhood knowledge of language other 
than my mother tongue. Nobody &ldquo;prepared&rdquo; me to learn foreign 
language. But I knew how to learn. I learned how to learn through my studies of 
language because it was something that clicked with me, and I studied it 
because I wanted to.</p> 
<p>Now, at the age of 35, I have taught myself many things, such as how to 
make a website, how to write for magazines, how to raise kids, and how to be 
happy. Many of my friends, as adults, have either changed their careers, or 
learned new things very well to get a job, or just for their own interest. My 
own dad changed careers two times. This last time he turned to architecture, 
and he's really good at it - despite being a car repairman until he was in his 
40's. He is not an exception. He just didn't let anyone tell him that he had to 
be young, prepared or even smart to do it. He did it anyway.</p> 
<p>If we let people pursue the things that make sense for them, they will 
naturally pick the things that they &quot;get&rdquo;. And if that's the case, 
they will pick it up fast. And it won't matter whether they had been 
&quot;prepared&quot; as children for that topic.</p> 
<p>You can also see this in our schools - kids are taught a lot of different 
subjects. But which specialties do kids usually choose when they go to college? 
The subjects that they already like. The subjects that they are good at. The 
subjects that make sense. Subjects that , given the choice, they would have 
probably already been studying even if nobody had told them to.</p> 
<p>We can't prepare our kids for everything. And reaching adulthood is not a 
ticket to stagnation. Anyone can learn something new, at any age. Even become 
specialists. It happens all the time.</p> 
<p>For me, this is why I'm so drawn to Zen Buddhism. It emphasizes trust in 
the universe that things happen the way they do because that's how things are 
meant to be. And that our wanting things to be a certain way, or expecting 
things a certain way, or even trying to predict what we need for the future, 
creates samsara &ndash; it creates suffering. Zen Buddhism emphasizes being 
open to the millions of possibilities. It is based on acceptance and 
understanding. Adapting to our circumstance is also an important element. I 
have found that these practices make things so much easier. I worry less, and 
trust that my kids will learn what they need to in order to attain their goals. 
That's why I don't stress about them learning or their future. That&rsquo;s 
also part of the process of how I ended up in this life without school.</p> 
<p>My kids will do what they need to do to succeed. They do everyday. Even 
things that are hard. Things that stretch their brain. Things that have meaning 
for them, and make sense for what works for their brains and spirits. I don't 
have expectations of what those things will be. But they will be *something*. I 
trust them.</p> 
<p>There are no guarantees in life. And we really can't prepare for tomorrow. 
Who knows which skills will be the most important? Who knows what new areas of 
technology or study or science or religion or what will be available? So, I 
don't focus on the &quot;what&quot; that my children study and learn. So long 
as they are studying something, I know they will succeed. They know how to 
learn. And how to be in this world.</p> 
<p>I don't think that learning, or religion, can prepare us for life. There is 
no &quot;preparation&quot; for life. We ARE living life. We're already here. 
It's on-the-job training. We are all on a path to discovering life as we go. 
So, no matter what we do, we're living life. As Zen Buddhist, one of my goals 
is to reduce samsara, and if I can&rsquo;t do that, to at least avoid creating 
samsara in others. Hopefully, when I do that, the world is a better place - no 
matter what name I give it.</p> 
<p>Anyway, this is all my perspective. Nothing I say here do I consider 
&quot;the truth&quot;. It's just my interpretation. This is just a story of how 
I put Zen Buddhism and education together in our family's life.</p> 
<p>Namaste.</p>

<h3>Work and Homeschooling~Guest Author</h3> 
<p>By Debra</p> 
<p>I am the owner of Axton Enterprises, a technology consulting firm that 
helps mail-order businesses get set up and trained to use business-management 
software, and also the publisher ofKidsOutAndAbout.com, an upstate New York web 
site that shows parents everything going on in their local area for kids and 
families. I home school my two daughters, Madison (7) and Ella (5).</p> 
<p>I love what I do professionally, and would want to continue even if it 
didn't contribute much to our bottom line. My husband is a mathematician, and 
although technically we could live on his salary, we wouldn't be able to save 
much for retirement if I didn't also work. I wanted to have financial 
independence just as a matter of principle. Also, I will confess, I am 
personally motivated by my love of free markets and capitalism. I had an 
intellectual understanding of free-market economics in college, and when I 
started working, seeing this in action was a wonderful confirmation. Then, in 
the late 1990s, I became close friends with someone who had emigrated from Cuba 
in 1992. Seeing freedom anew through her eyes heightened my commitment to 
participating fully in the system that makes so much achievement and wealth 
possible here in this country. Just as important is my desire to model 
&ldquo;the entrepreneurial mind&rdquo; for my children, which will serve them 
well no matter where their future endeavors will take them.<br>
<br>
I have 
always determined that my children would have the best education possible so 
that they will, in turn, be able to find their own dream jobs someday. I 
suspected that, given the declining quality of teachers over the past 40 years, 
their main teacher would need to be me. Fortunately, much of what I have done 
for the past 14 years has been teaching (training adults), and I seem to be 
inclined this way. So even before the girls were born, I designed my businesses 
to be run from home so that I could be the one to educate them. The fact that I 
loved my work meant that I did not want to give it up completely in order to 
educate the kids; fortunately, today&rsquo;s technology makes that unnecessary.
<br><br>
When I was a teenager in the 1980s, I watched as the technology 
developed rapidly. When I was about 16, a friend remarked that the 
possibilities for careers were expanding so quickly that it was likely that 
what the two of us would end up doing probably hadn't been invented yet. Even 
though at the time I did not consider the possibility of a career in business, 
I thought I could somehow use the developing technology to design a career that 
would give me the best work-life balance possible. I was determined to have the 
time and flexibility to make sure my future children would have the visibility 
and guidance from me that I had lacked from my own parents. I had thought, at 
the time, that I would probably be a technical writer, but I always had the 
mind-set of leaving my options open, of always looking around to see where I 
could best create value. I didn't know at the time that this is the essence of 
the entrepreneur.<br>
<br>
In the mid-1990s, before I had kids, I saw that home 
schooling was an increasingly popular alternative to public schools. I decided 
that this was the path for me. That was right at the time I was establishing 
Axton Enterprises, so I was able to design my business from the very start to 
accommodate my being involved with my kids. I worked out of the home, even 
before it became popular to do so. Madison was born in 1999, Ella in 2001. When 
they were babies, I had a business-hours nanny watch them there with me in the 
house.<br>
<br>
And then, from mid-2003 to mid-2005, they attended a Montessori 
preschool in the mornings. Because the girls liked the school so well, I 
decided to let them stay there for their early education, which would let me 
continue to work. In 2005, we moved from Rochester, NY to Charlottesville, VA, 
and I had assumed that they would like the Montessori school here as well. But 
there was only one school in the city that went past preschool, and Madison was 
already in first grade. We gave it a good try, but found it a grim, somewhat 
anti-intellectual place, with lots of rules. It had rigidity without rigor, 
whereas I was looking for rigor without rigidity.<br>
<br>
So, this past 
February, I pulled them out mid-year and began homeschooling, as I had always 
intended to do sometime. To my surprise, we came out a bit ahead, financially, 
because I was able to keep up with much of my work while saving on the cost of 
the school. Plus, I saved myself over an hour per day of driving them to and 
from school, so that gave me time back. We work together until about noon, 
often with me having to interrupt myself from working with them to talk with 
clients or to answer emails (my laptop and I are joined at the hip). In the 
afternoon, the kids either have additional activities outside the home, or they 
play while I continue to work.<br>
<br>
One of my greatest personal pleasures 
is that my girls get to see, every day, what work means. In a 
political-economic system such as we have in the United States, it is possible 
to create one's own opportunity; a person never need be constrained by someone 
else's vision of one's professional life. Madison and Ella are exposed in an 
immediate way to how I interact with clients, and they see how hard I work to 
create value in a few different marketplaces. One thing they will have, which I 
never understood while growing up, is a sense that hard work--when it's 
something you love--is pleasurable, and constitutes a significant part of a 
fulfilled life. They know that I view their education as the most important of 
my three jobs, but they also see how much it means to me to be able to do my 
own work.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
So whatever my girls 
choose to do some day, they will be entrepreneurs, at least in spirit. Whatever 
professional positions they hold, they will understand how to treat their jobs 
as an opportunity continually to create value. That way, no matter where their 
inner voice guides them, they will be able to travel as far as they want to go. 
And, whatever they end up doing, it probably hasn't been invented yet.</p>

<h3>The Finance Gap</h3> 
<p>By Laureen</p> 
<p>Money. Finance. Cash flow.</p> 
<p>...words that strike guilt, inadequacy, and fear, into the hearts of most 
of us. We have these cringes built-in about finance, yet the majority of us 
received little to no financial education. If we were lucky enough to have 
financially astute parents, then maybe we got that knowledge passed to us, but 
the vast majority of us didn&rsquo;t. And then we beat ourselves up for being 
illiterate.</p> 
<p>I think about this a lot. People pounce on unschoolers and homeschoolers 
about teaching reading, writing, math, and science, but in terms of being 
prepared to lead a comfortable life, finance education is probably one of the 
most important topics to cover. Yet no well-meaning relative quizzes our 
children on the value of the dollar against the Euro; they just ask goofy 
questions about multiplication tables. No one drops by issues of<em>Forbes</em> 
or<em>Money</em> or the <em>Wall</em> <em>Street Journal</em> the way they hand 
over workbooks and readers.</p> 
<p>Scott Noelle, one of my favorite parenting gurus, coined the phrase 
&quot;the healing gap&quot;. His explanation of the phenomenon:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>How could I raise a child responsibly when I was still recovering from my 
own troubled childhood?</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>That feeling, over seven years ago, came from an awareness of what I now 
call the healing gap, a phenomenon that arises when a person consciously seeks 
a healthier path than the one he or she is currently on. In parenthood, it's 
the gap between the healthy parenting ideas you embrace consciously and what 
you're actually capable of doing, here and now.</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Real-life parenting does not emerge solely from the parent's conscious 
intentions; it involves the whole person &mdash; mind, body, emotions and 
spirit &mdash; as well as the social and cultural context in which it takes 
place. In other words, it's easy to change your mind, but implementing a change 
in your whole self is far more difficult, especially when going against the 
grain of society and culture.</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The gap between parenting theory and practice is filled with 
&quot;stuff&quot;: each parent's unique collection of fears, attachments, 
emotional wounds, unmet needs and obsolete strategies &mdash; plus external, 
sociocultural pressures &mdash; that impede our efforts to do what we believe 
is best.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>While working through my own finance baggage, I realized that Scott's gap 
exists every bit as much for money as it does for parenting. There&rsquo;s 
definitely a gap between the financial education and security I want my kids to 
have, and the levels of both of those things I currently possess. Bad finances 
and lack of financial knowledge create a level of underlying tension that I 
believe gets in the way of both good modeling and good parenting. How many of 
us can really, deeply relax into being present in the moment, when 
there&rsquo;s money stress of some kind hanging over our heads?</p> 
<p>Because modeling is such a huge part of unschooling, I need to model fiscal 
responsibility and financial empowerment, if that&rsquo;s what I want them to 
learn.&nbsp; And in wading through finance information, I am routinely smacked 
with fears, attachments, emotional wounds, unmet needs, and oh man, the 
obsolete strategies. And of course, the sociocultural pressures to behave badly 
financially are all around us.</p> 
<p>So, I&rsquo;m getting my financial house in order. I&rsquo;m reading books 
and websites, I&rsquo;m tackling one major pain point a month: tax filing 
system, insurance organization, creating a trust, establishing a money market 
account, learning about the stock market. And my kids are watching. 
They&rsquo;re too little now to really understand what&rsquo;s involved here, 
but I found that if I give myself the same patience and encouragement with baby 
steps that I allow them, that I come along just fine. And that each bit of 
knowledge I gain is one step closer to closing the gap.</p>

<h3>Self Directed Learners: Homeschooling Presidents</h3> 
<p>By Marsha</p> 
<p>I read with great interest stories of homeschooled or self-taught people, 
trying to find clues that would help me guide my children in a way that would 
result in them becoming self-directed.&nbsp; Probably even more important, I 
unconsciously modeled a love for reading and research, reading voraciously 
whenever I can find a moment, sometimes when I should be doing something 
else!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I realized later that perhaps my reading, note-taking, 
conversation, and the resulting free-lance articles, were as valuable in 
developing a love of learning in my children as anything I learned during my 
research.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Did you know that 1/3 of our presidents were homeschooled?&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Let's start then, with these boys who grew up to be leaders of men.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;John Quincy Adams</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;James Buchanan</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grover Cleveland</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Millard Fillmore</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;James Garfield</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;William Henry Harrison</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Herbert Hoover</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thomas Jefferson</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Andrew Johnson</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Abraham Lincoln</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;James Madison</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;James Monroe</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Franklin Delano Roosevelt</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Theodore Roosevelt</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Zachary Taylor</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;George Washington</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Woodrow Wilson</p> 
<p>President John Quincy Adams had little early schooling, but at the age of 
11 accompanied his father to France and kept a journal, which later developed 
into one of the most famous of diaries.&nbsp; &nbsp;As I contemplated what I 
could borrow from this scenario, I thought about what an enriching experience 
travel is.&nbsp; Even if you can't travel abroad, there are enough places right 
within driving distance of most of our homes, to keep us all busy for a few 
years.&nbsp; And if you can't take a two week or month-long vacation, don't 
despair.&nbsp; Day trips can be just as rewarding and educational!&nbsp; 
Whether you are driving the coast road, exploring the mountains in search of 
birds and wildflowers, or checking out historical markers, encourage your 
children to record their impressions!&nbsp; &nbsp;Find some nature journals at 
the library to use as examples.&nbsp; If they aren't writers, perhaps they are 
talkers and can dictate their thoughts and impressions to you or a tape player, 
or draw pictures which you can help them caption until the time comes that they 
can do it for themselves.&nbsp; Some homeschoolers have children who have 
become very talented videographers.&nbsp; Rather than focus on what they can't 
do or haven't learned, figure out how to help them use the skills they have 
now, and once they've developed some self-confidence, you can build on 
that.&nbsp; I figured that field trips with other homeschoolers, day trips on 
our own, and vacations like this one, provided perfect opportunities for 
learning to record what the kids have learned.&nbsp; We'll be putting together 
scrapbooks of our trip when we get home.&nbsp; You can help your child make 
portfolios or scrapbooks of his or her learning journey, too!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Andrew Johnson was poor;&nbsp; his family couldn't afford schooling and he 
never had a day's schooling in his life.&nbsp; He didn't learn to read until 
his wife taught him at the age of 18.&nbsp; However, though deprived of books 
and schooling, he frequented a tailor shop where public spirited people often 
came to the tailor shop where he worked to read to the tailors.&nbsp; Later he 
became an apprentice for that tailor shop, and impressed the other tailors with 
his eagerness to obtain an education.&nbsp; I pondered on what key factors to 
bring into our learning experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had the feeling that if my 
children were required to contribute to their own upkeep, so to speak, that 
they would acquire naturally a desire to be self-sufficient.&nbsp; Thus, we 
determined that certain expenses were not rights of being a child in our 
family, but that children were responsible for them.&nbsp; For instance, we 
covered family outings and certain expenses to do with entertainment, but 
anything that fell beyond that realm was the child's responsibility.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;This inspired them early on to figure out ways to earn their own 
money.&nbsp; We also helped them find safe jobs by providing positions within 
family businesses, and we chauffeured them to do lawn care and odd jobs for a 
number of years before they were able to drive themselves.&nbsp; While we 
expect the kids to share in normal weekly and daily maintenance as their 
privilege of being a member of our family, we do pay them for doing or helping 
with certain large unusual jobs of maintenance or repair around our 
house.&nbsp; &nbsp;While Andrew Johnson had to work out of sheer necessity, our 
kids have had life pretty easy, but are required to to work to do and have some 
of the things their peers have had handed to them.&nbsp; However, I can't count 
the times our peers have asked us, &quot;What's your secret to growing such 
hard-working kids?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if we are very well-off financially, 
it's important for our children to be responsible for providing for themselves 
in some areas.&nbsp; Our kids know they have to purchase their own vehicle if 
they want one to drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;And pay for their own insurance and 
license.&nbsp; What an incentive plan to drive safely and carefully to keep 
those insurance rates down!.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's a tough lesson when a moment of 
irresponsibility ends up raising your insurance rates!&nbsp; I feel that we 
aren't doing kids any favor when we provide everything for them and don't teach 
them responsibility.&nbsp; A recent article in Reader's Digest backs me 
up.&nbsp; A couple of scenarios from this article, excerpted from Business Week 
into the RD Money column:&nbsp; Problem:&nbsp; Your kids get a generous 
allowance, but they still come to you for movie money and trendy clothing 
purchases.&nbsp; &nbsp;Solution:&nbsp; Establish expenses that your kids must 
cover.&nbsp; Another scenario:&nbsp; When you tell your kids to sink or swim 
with expenses, they sink.&nbsp; Solution:&nbsp; Advance them funds for 
overlooked essentials with a plan for repayment.&nbsp; But ignore pleas to 
underwrite the next ski trip.&nbsp; Good advice for anyone, this can also be 
part of your kids education.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether they do some odd jobs for 
neighbors and acquaintances, or start their own business, the lessons they will 
learn will be indelible.&nbsp; I figured these life lessons would stand them in 
good stead, and so far, that has proven true.&nbsp; You can do the same!&nbsp;

<p>Abraham Lincoln had less then two years of formal schooling, mostly hit or 
miss.&nbsp; He was an avid reader, though, sometimes walking miles to borrow a 
book, and reading by candle-light or firelight.&nbsp; While his ste-mother 
encouraged him and seemed to understand the value of education for Abe, with 
his inquiring mind, she didn't have a lot of resources at her disposal.&nbsp; 
I'm not sure she had much education herself, but she did, according to all we 
read, have a wealth of love and caring for the children.&nbsp; &nbsp;We don't 
have to provide a perfect environment for our kids to learn in, or have a 
degree, if we can provide a love for books and reading, and model a thirst for 
knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Abe Lincoln would walk miles to borrow or return a book, 
and we, too, can teach our children the value of books and learning.&nbsp; We 
can model lifelong learning as we research homeschooling, educational methods, 
and things that intrigue us or our children.&nbsp; I try to model lifelong 
learning by indulging my love of books, reading out loud to my children early 
and often,&nbsp; having plenty of books available on subjects that interest 
them (and things I would like them to learn about),&nbsp; and visiting our 
library at least weekly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, when we travel, we either listen to 
books on tape, or I read out loud to everyone from books or magazines like 
Reader's Digest, Newsweek, Time, or &quot;Your Old Boat&quot;.&nbsp; .&nbsp; 
You can do the same!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>President Woodrow Wilson was taught at home by his father, who wasn't 
concerned when Woodrow didn't learn his letters and numbers as quickly as 
children who were in schools.&nbsp; Wilson himself once said, &quot;What need 
was there to read, when I could spend hours listening to others read 
aloud?&quot;&nbsp; His home was full of books, his parents spent time with him, 
and most of his youth was spent in the company of great minds. When thinking 
about Woodrow being a later reader, I re-read some of Dr. Raymond Moore's 
books, particularly &quot;Better Late Than Early&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Dr. 
Moore's &quot;Home-Grown Kids&quot; was one of the first homeschooling books I 
read before we began this oddysey.)&nbsp; While pointing out that many kids 
aren't ready for intense academic instruction at an early age, he also suggests 
that children are ripe for learning at any age.&nbsp; Have you heard the term 
equivalent education?&nbsp; It simply means learning the same things in a 
different way.&nbsp; This is something homeschoolers can do to help their kids 
who experience later readiness levels;&nbsp; teach them the same things in a 
different way.&nbsp; Rather than using a beginning reader, perhaps you can play 
games with magnetic letters on the fridge, make up a &quot;word box&quot;, 
label items around the house, play memory games, identify letters and numbers 
on billboards and signs along the road, help you child make their own flash 
cards, or simply spend more time reading out loud to him or her.&nbsp; 
Woodrow's parents spent time with him, and provided him with a rich learning 
environment and interaction with interesting people.&nbsp; I figured I could do 
that!&nbsp; You can, too!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It seems I am always learning of another famous person or meeting someone 
who was homeschooled;&nbsp; we can all learn much from what worked for 
them.&nbsp; But remember, although we can try to duplicate some of the common 
threads of the lives of famous homeschoolers, the most important lesson we can 
impart to our children is that it's important that they know who they are and 
develop who they are.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be impossible to duplicate the 
experiences of homeschoolers from the past, or even the present.&nbsp; And even 
if it were possible, and there was a formula we could follow, do we want 
to?&nbsp; &nbsp;No.&nbsp; What we want to do is develop a personalized program 
of life and learning that works for our children, our family, and what works 
for me won't necessarily work for you, what works for you might not work for 
your neighbor, but we can all learn from each other, while we find the right 
path for ourselves and our loved ones.</p>

<p>The wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single 
dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and 
free men.~John F. Kennedy</p> </li> </ul> 
<h2>Editor's Corner</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>  It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, 
to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer 
meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in 
movement there is life, and in change there is power. ~Alan Cohen
