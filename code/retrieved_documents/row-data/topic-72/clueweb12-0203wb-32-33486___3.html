<h2> The Benefits of Learning Language Young</h2> 
<p>Young children are uniquely suited to learning a second language. The 
developing brain is hard-wired to acquire language. Never again will it be this 
natural or this easy!</p> 
<p>Click to view video of our Education Director Karen Gould discuss the 
benefits of learning a language young.</p> 
<h3>Children Learn A Second Language Naturally</h3> 
<p>Exposing your child to a second language while young allows a child to 
optimize his or her learning potential, helping to shape the brain at its most 
flexible stage. Young children are uniquely suited to learning a second 
language.&nbsp; Learning a second language at a young age is cognitively as 
easy as learning a first language.</p> 
<p>Young children can acquire native-like fluency as easily as they learned to 
walk. Where adults have to work through an established first-language system, 
studying explicit grammar rules and practicing rote drills, the young kids 
learn naturally, absorbing the sounds, structures, intonation patterns and 
rules of a second language intuitively, as they did their mother tongue. The 
young brain is inherently flexible and uniquely hard-wired to acquire language 
naturally.</p> 
<p>In taking advantage of this&nbsp;window of opportunity, young learners 
enjoy a wide range of benefits:</p> 
<h3>Linguistic Benefits</h3> 
<p>Young language learners can acquire native-like fluency as easily as they 
learned to walk, in contrast to an adult language learner. Where adult learners 
have to work through an established first-language system, studying explicit 
grammar rules and practicing rote drills, the young learner learns naturally, 
absorbing the sounds, structures, intonation patterns and rules of a second 
language intuitively, as they did their mother tongue. The young brain is 
inherently flexible, uniquely hard-wired to acquire language naturally.</p> 
<p>Older learners lose the ability to hear and reproduce new sounds by age 
8-12, according to experts, resulting in a permanent foreign-sounding accent in 
any language. Younger learners benefit from flexible ear and speech muscles 
that can still hear the critical differences between the sounds of a second 
language, as well as reproduce them with native-like quality.</p> 
<h3>Cognitive Benefits</h3> 
<p>While some parents worry that starting their toddler on a second language 
will interfere with developing English skills, the opposite is actually true. 
Children can differentiate between two languages within the first weeks of 
life. &quot;Learning another language actually enhances a child's overall 
verbal development,&quot; says Roberta Michnick Golinkoff Ph.D., author of<em>
How Babies Talk.</em></p> 
<p>The research goes on to show a number of additional cognitive benefits to 
learning a second language at an early age. Children who study foreign language 
show higher cognitive performance in overall basic skills in elementary school. 
According to the College Entrance Examination Board, they go on to score higher 
on SATs. Children who learn a foreign language at a young age also exhibit 
better problem-solving skills, enhanced spatial relations, and heightened 
creativity. Learning a second language early on encourages flexible thinking 
and communication skills, helping children consider issues from more than one 
perspective.</p> 
<p>Additionally, research shows that multilinguals have enhanced memory, 
planning, and multi-tasking skills. When learning multiple languages young, the 
brain is trained to attend to salient information and to disregard 
non-pertinent information, a skill that later supports better focus, memory, 
planning and multitasking abilities. Research shows that multilinguals use more 
of their brains than monolinguals and outperform monolinguals on creativity 
tests.</p> 
<h3>Lifelong Benefits</h3> 
<p>The gift of language is an investment that last a lifetime!</p> 
<p>Young learners enrich their lives and open up doors to their future by 
gaining:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>An expanded world view.</li> 
<li>Greater intercultural appreciation and sensitivity.</li> 
<li>Ability to learn additional languages more easily.</li> 
<li>A competitive edge in future markets and&nbsp;the global marketplace.</li> 
</ul>  On Language Learning...  &quot;Americans who travel abroad for the first 
time are often shocked to discover that, despite all the progress that has been 
made in the last 30 years, many foreign people still speak in foreign 
languages.&quot;<br>
