Serving pre-prepared food doesn't mean you're a bad parent <br>

<p>In this age of farm-to-table dinner adoration and making one's own butter 
and baking powder from scratch, I rise up in defense of the drive-thru, the TV 
dinner and the semi and fully-prepared dinners from the grocery store. That 
includes bags o' salad, minced garlic and frozen pizza.</p> 
<p>As I return to work full-time at CNN.com, I take this stand for my mother, 
a single parent just a few decades ago. Not known for her cooking, she 
sometimes drove me through McDonald's after soccer practice or theater class 
and served me a Swanson's TV dinner once week.</p> 
<p>Many more parents today are the children of parents who did not know how to 
cook, so I applaud any supermarket effort that makes it easier to eat at home - 
even if it involves opening a chicken pasta combo package and pre-cut veggies.
<br> <br>
 It's obviously a popular way to feed our families. Nearly half of 
all Americans use partially prepared foods or ready-to-cook foods to feed their 
families, according to a 2010 Mintel survey.</p> 
<p>&quot;Fast food and TV dinners did serve their purpose on days when we had 
one thing after the other or there was no time to go to the grocery store or 
nobody had clean underwear so laundry had to be done,&quot; says my mom. 
&quot;With the time saved, we could still talk about what happened with a kid 
harassing you at school, without my worrying about burning something-which I 
did anyhow, every so often.&quot;</p> 
<p>My mother's own mother had refused to teach her to cook, thinking that it 
would trap my mother in the home rather than in the world of work where my 
grandmother thought she should live. That was a radical notion in the 1940s and 
1950s, that my mother should have an outside adult life.</p> 
<p>Once she married and had me, my mother figured out how to cook a few things 
- we often had nice arroz con pollo (chicken and rice) with platanos (fried 
plantains). But it has never been easy for her the way it has for mothers who 
have cooked from scratch since they were little girls. My mother cooked big 
batches of stew or other dishes on the weekends and punted on soccer practice 
and theater class nights.</p> 
<p>That's why I cringe when the foodies make speeches in condescending tones 
about how parents should try harder and commit more time for cooking at home. 
In some two-parent families with enough money and time and help, please do turn 
off the electronic devices and try to cook with your children - and eat with 
them too.</p> 
<p>Even those of us with more time or money than our struggling parents have a 
hard time cooking because we didn't learn how to do it well as children. Dinner 
prep looks easy in the hands of a pro, can take as little as 20 minutes and 
tastes delicious. When I'm in charge, it&rsquo;s harder and takes longer and 
could involve a TV bribe to keep my kid from amused while I try to cook.</p> 
<p>Shortcuts allow me to hear about my kid's day at pre-school, talk about the 
bugs she saw and the snacks she ate, make sure she's learning to share and not 
getting into any fights.</p> 
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not only cooking time, but shopping for food,&quot; says 
my mom. &quot;For those of us for whom cooking is not an occupation or a hobby, 
it takes longer. An expert cook could probably make things faster but they have 
to concentrate.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'm going to continue to buy the Amy's Pizza and packaged veggies to make 
sure dinner can be ready in 15 minutes if need be. When I cook, I try to go 
easy on myself, choosing recipes that are hard to screw up and can be turned 
into something else the next day. I rarely cook something I know the kid won't 
eat. And I do try to learn to cook simple good dishes that even parents like me 
can handle.</p> 
<p>Here is a fantastic roast chicken recipe that is hard to screw up. (I often 
place the bird on the wrong side, and it doesn't matter).</p> 
<p><strong>Easy Roast Chicken</strong></p> 
<p>Whole fresh chicken (Murray's or Bell and Evans or something tasty)<br>
 
Meyer lemon (or regular lemon if Meyers aren't available)<br>
 Fresh parsley, 
rinsed and chopped up<br>
 Adobo spice if available (I use Goya brand), or salt 
and pepper<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Heat your oven to 400&deg;F. Spread 
olive oil on the bottom of a roasting pan with a rack.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Get a 
whole chicken and remove the giblets. Cut a lemon in half and stuff 1/2 lemon 
and fresh parsley (if you have it) into the cavity. I like to use a Meyer lemon 
when they're available.</p> 
<p>Use Adobo or salt and pepper it inside and outside like crazy.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> Put the chicken onto the roasting pan rack and cook it for about 20 
minutes per pound, maybe a little bit less depending on factors I don't 
understand. Just make sure the internal temperature of the bird reaches 
165&deg;F at the thickest part, without the thermometer touching the bone.</p> 
<p>(Usually recipes say put the breasts up but I did it with breasts down and 
it worked - breasts cook faster so it worked it have them downside).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Add vegetables around the chicken in the last 30-45 minutes of cooking to 
make it a one-pot meal. I usually add cut carrots, quartered onions and cut up 
roasting potatoes. They soak up the olive oil and chicken juices.</p>

<p>In today's world, many households have two working parents (if not single 
parents). Making everything from scratch every day is not very realistic. But I 
think it is important to find ways to put a meal together quickly while 
fulfilling dietary needs. I love the suggestion of adding fresh veggies to a 
frozen meal. A rotisserie chicken in most grocery stores will run you about $7. 
Pair that with some frozen veggies that you can steam in the bag and some whole 
wheat rolls, and you have yourself a pretty decent meal at a decent price. If 
that isn't an option, invest in a slow cooker. Not so good for chicken if you 
need to be able to let the meal cook for an entire workday, but awesome for 
beef. I have made some amazing beef stew and shoulder roasts while at work!</p>

<p>Hi there fellow blogger! Discovered your site by means of the search 
engine, and was forwarded to your web site, lol. Anyway, great article that you 
just written here, I find the content material to be very informational, in a 
way. On the other hand I am just wondering whether or not a fellow blogger like 
you wish to do a little hyperlink trade with me, as I'm always looking for 
quality blogs like yours, to additional expand my community of friends. Let me 
know, and thanks in advance.</p>  December 8, 2011 at 7:16 am | </li>

<p>My mom was also a very busy person and, not being very inclined to cook, 
she rarely brought herself to spend more than 20 minutes in the kitchen. She is 
one of those people who learned to cook very early on and often tells me about 
how every Saturday they'd make pies or cookies. She never did become all that 
proficient at the prep work but what she did do was stockpile very efficient 
recipes where she could throw everything together, toss it in the oven and go 
do something else. Did she ever burn food? Sure. But we still ate fresh food 
six days a week on a pretty tight budget.</p> 
<p>While I love cooking and enjoy making all kinds of things from scratch from 
her I learned how to cook in a pinch. I inherited a lot of her recipes and 
though I usually take my time with cooking if I'm in a hurry I can still throw 
together a lasagna, roasted chicken, spanish rice and dozens of other meals 
together in 20 minutes and move on to something else. And for the record, my 
wife doesn't cook and doesn't care to. The kitchen is mine and we're quite 
happy with that!</p>  December 5, 2011 at 10:21 am | </li>

<p>If you can't tell &ndash; I am being sarcastic. As a working mom, I am 
fortunate to be able to have a flexible schedule and have at least 5 dinners a 
week made from &quot;scratch&quot; &ndash; not even pre-cut/frozen veggies. But 
we need to be tolerant that many parents do the best they can, and these 
pre-prepared foods sometimes are the best alternative.</p>  December 5, 2011 at

<li> <strong>Lee</strong> <br>

<p>I don't care how busy you are: are people actually buying foods from 
grocery stores? What lazy parents! You should be ashamed of yourselves! You 
should be growing your own vegetables, slaughtering your own chickens and 
milling your own flour to bake breads. What are you teaching your kids? That 
foods come from grocery stores?</p>  December 5, 2011 at 4:52 am | </li>

<p>Of course there are times when people need to grab something quick because 
they are just not home to cook. I do it too. But most meals at our house are 
cooked from fresh whole ingredients. The one thing that is not addressed here 
is the significant savings of making food from scratch. I encourage my kids to 
help me, and sit at the counter in the kitchen. We talk about their day, they 
learn to cook, and get great nutrition. We have fun, and from time to time a 
carrot, olive or nut creeps it's way into their mouth. My 5 year old actually 
wants to be a chef when he grows up. One of the games they all play together is 
Iron Chef.</p>  December 2, 2011 at 2:59 pm | </li>

<p>LAZY AND SLOW. That's what I see a lot of today. When I was a teenager in 
Puerto Rico my mother worked the register at a department store, ran a boarding 
house and cooked rice and beans or pasta with baked chicken, fried fish, pork 
or onion cube steak with side salads or veggie escoveich on a daily basis for 
20 years. She was fit and happy and would ask me to drive her to have fun on 
weekends, she also taught me the value of learning to cook, take care of myself 
and be organized, not to waste time and to be handy with many things, she would 
ask the neighborhood shop owners (mecanics, carpenters, masons) to take me in 
during the summer and to let me learn. Today I come home from work, fix my own 
cars, do my own home repairs, do my own laundry and cook full meals for my 
family in about 20 minutes when my wife is sick or too busy with school work, 
and I'm a man.</p>  December 1, 2011 at 8:13 am |

<p>I don't care how busy you are, there is no excuse for serving kids 
processed foods. Good nutrition is the building block of health. Processed 
foods will set your kids up with a lifetime of health problems. It's that 
simple. Simple, healthy meals can be made in bulk and are not expensive. For 
example, I have a great rice cooker, and cook 10 cups of brown rice at one time 
that can then be refrigerated and served over a week. Make a little effort, and 
your kids will be healthier in the future.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 10:18 pm |

<p>Since this is turning into a household hints blog, here's one: the freezer 
is your friend. Right now, turkey is dirt cheap. Buy a couple frozen ones and 
chuck 'em in the freezer. Cook one and you'll have lunch and dinner for four 
for several days, and you can make a couple gallons of soup from the carcass 
that can also be frozen. The time involved is almost entirely oven and 
unattended stovetop time &ndash; actual kitchen work for the above is probably 
about half an hour, tops. If you like, you can also portion out the bird and 
freeze individual servings so you don't have to eat turkey day in and day out 
for days on end.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 6:22 pm | </li>

<p>You know why food is a problem in our society? Because we can't slow the 
F#@&amp; down! You work endlessly to pay for a new car, a huge television, 
school loans for a degree that won't get you anywhere, some designer clothes 
you don't need, and other piles of crap stacked so high you don't have room for 
it in your 3800 sq ft suburbian house you can't afford. Do you realize how 
stupid everyone is for not having enough time to feed themselves!? Wake up

<p>Amen, that's why I'm going to sell out and move back to the Caribbean, 
where I spent my youth, as soon as my last kid clears college. Being a born in 
NYC and doing the rat race thing in the Southeast has been enough for me; I 
want to spend my last days where folks mean it when they smile and say 'buenos 
dias' , and where you can pick seafood, eggs and the ingredients for the day's 
salad off the back of a stake truck that drives by your house every day...</p>

<li> <strong>SixDegrees</strong> <br>

<p>OK, 'pre-prepared' is redundant, but I guess we're stuck with it. I don't 
see any problem with it; I like to cook, but not everyone does, and fwiw i did 
lots of me own 'pre-preparation' leading up to Thanksgiving so I only had to 
spend maybe an hour in the kitchen on the day itself. Even though a lot of this 
prep was done well in advance &ndash; probably longer than the prepared food 
you buy in supermarkets has been sitting around &ndash; it was just fine, and 
no one would be able to tell the difference if it had been slavishly prepped 
just moments before cooking.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 6:02 pm | </li>

<p>My phone has no spell check, my high school is the poorest in the state,

<p>The reason America is and will always stay fat. When did parents stop 
sacrificing for their children? Convienience food is anything but. It might 
make your stomach full but it causes more doctors visits because of all the 
chemicals and salts and other things your body can't process make you sick. 
Most will not understand this but try having some kids with food allergies and 
being forced to feed them real food. You have a choice, watch your kid suffer 
or do the right thing. The media should stop trying to sell these types of 
ideas and move more towards promoting real food. Unfortunatley real food does 
not bring in the big money. Stay fat and sick America.</p>  November 30, 2011

<p>Some of us DO sacrifice for our kids by working umpteen hours a week just 
to keep a roof over their heads, the heating bills paid, and some clothes on 
their backs. We sacrifice by using our non-working time to help them with 
schoolwork, play with them, take them to activities, listen to them unload at 
the end of the day, or guide them in learning how to help with household chores 
(including cooking). We sacrifice our sleep to get even the most basic 
housework done after they're in bed, so that they have clean clothes to wear to 
school and a reasonable living space to come home to. We get up early in order 
to get ourselves ready for work before having to get them up and make 
breakfast, get them loaded up and off to school. Sometimes, in all of that, a 
home-cooked meal made of fresh ingredients falls by the wayside. We do the best 
we can with some home cooked meals and the healthiest prepared stuff we can 
find in the minimal amount of time we have to go grocery shopping. What we need 
are HEALTHY prepared meals without all the additives, preservatives, etc. I 
would give my right arm for some good choices along those lines ... or for a 
cook to make us great meals 4-5 nights a week!!</p>  November 30, 2011 at 3:50

<p>So Mark, who is cooking up and feeding your child all these from-scratch 
meals...you or your stay-at-home wife? Feeding your kid something pre-prepared 
a couple nights a week isn't going to kill them, and it doesn't automatically 
translate into shoving a Happy Meal at them either. There are a great many 
healthy packaged foods at the supermarket with reduced sodium, whole grains, 
low fat and no corn syrup. I know how to read and I use that valuable skill on 
nutritional labels, as anyone could.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 5:02 pm | 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Kristin</strong> <br>

<p>You're wrong if you think any of the pre-packaged foods at a grocery store 
are a &quot;healthy&quot; option. The ingredients contained within are 
typically related to corn and soy, the two industrialized foods our government 
subsidizes farmers to grow and they are not grown in bio-dynamic soils which 
means they lack the level of nutrients found in organic fruits and vegetables 
grown in nutrient rich soils. True, no one is going to die from eating a 
processed food here and there. The problem is that we all rely on them more 
than here or there. If you walk around a super-market almost 90% of everything 
in it can be sourced back to corn and soy beans. It's the monoculture that's 
the problem. We are not eating enough diverse, whole foods. Read the Omnivore's 
Dilemma and In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan. It will seriously rearrange 
how you think about food in this country.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 6:21 pm | 
</li> 
<li> <strong>Seth</strong> <br>

<p>Kristin, you need to learn about how much hype the organic food movement 
has been spewing. There is zero evidence that eating organic foods improves 
health. Please watch Penn and Teller's Bull$hit show on organic foods&ndash; 
they debunk the nonsense.</p>  December 1, 2011 at 3:17 am | </li> </ul> </li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li> <strong>Lucy</strong> <br>

<p>Reading nutritional labels, carefully looking over ingredient lists, etc, 
and basing your menus on that information seems like the most important part of 
all of this. There are plenty of homemade recipes full of ingredients that 
&quot;can kill you,&quot; and there are plenty of minimally-processed or even 
fully-prepared meals that are wholesome, balanced, low in sodium, preservative 
free, etc. Rather than trying to decide who's right and who's wrong, let's all 
just spend some time considering the actual nutritional content of the food we 
eat. I also think it's important to take from the original article the idea 
that people are doing the best they can. We are all doing the best we can to 
raise healthy, happy, well-rounded kids and it is the big picture that matters. 
There are a million ways to put all the pieces together, and there is no point 
in trying to crap on other people for sport. For those of you who ARE good, 
quick home cooks who happen to be criticizing the author, perhaps you could 
post a recipe or two of your own so that others can benefit? That might be a 
bit more helpful.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 2:42 pm | </li>

<p>Richard, please acknowledge that 1 in every 5 kids in this country 
currently go to bed hungry&ndash;hence your comment was way out of line.<br>
 
Also, sure Pre-prepared food is easy, yet homemade food is NOT difficult at 
all, even novice cooks can learn to cook for their families while making 
memories of time together in the kitchen and fragrant flavors to last for a 
lifetime.<br>
 Prime example is this recipe from the cookbook: LOVE MORE FEED 
LESS (less prepackaged and previously prepared):</p> 
<p>Oodles Of Noodles and Zuckles (zucchini pasta)<br>
 Serve 6-8<br>
 Preheat 
oven to 350&deg; F</p> 
<p> 2 tablespoons combined butter and canola or olive oil butter spread<br>
 3 
medium-large zucchinis<br>
 3 cups of your favorite homemade or bottled sauce 
Tomato Sauce (pg&hellip;)<br>
 1-2 teaspoons of minced garlic (if using canned 
sauces)<br>
 6-8 ounces thinly sliced or grated Provolone and/or Mozzarella 
Cheese<br>
 2 tablespoons Parmesan and/or Romano Cheese<br>
 12-ounces package 
Rotini or Penne pasta,</p> 
<p> 1. Spread the canola based spread all over the bottom and sides of a 
9&times;13-inch pan.<br>
 2. Slice the zucchini into 1/4 inch slices and layer 
all over the pan. Pour the sauce over the<br>
 zucchini, and then very gently 
mix the garlic only into the sauce. Bake for 25-30 minutes.<br>
 3. Prepare the 
pasta, according to the package directions.<br>
 4. Remove the pan from the 
oven and cover the entire top with the cheese. Return the pan to the oven and 
continue baking until the cheese has melted and begins to bubble, about 5-10 
minutes.<br>
 5. Serve over the warm pasta.</p>  December 1, 2011 at 10:27 am |

<p>Ok I was going to read some of the responses to this but you all like to 
write today. Anyways pre-prepared foods are not a problem, McDonalds, and other 
fast food places are not a problem. Americans want to blame our fatness on 
someone else. I am not going to lie I go out and eat fast food alot and thats 
because it is 'fast' food. I am 22yrs old and I can cook pretty darn well I 
think, healthy meals or not, I am from Tennessee we like to eat in the south 
especially on the hilltops of VA, NC, KY, and TN. I know how to eat healthy 
sure but alot of the time I just want to fix something that is fatty because it 
tastes good. It is better to know that moderation is key, most of the time I 
will try not to eat as much as I can but sometimes its just too hard. Its so 
good. But anyways I will jump off of my soapbox now. Any comments, or questions?

<p>Hooray, Richard! You are a voice of reason! First, personal responsibility 
for what we do, and how we eat. Second, moderation is key in all things. If I 
rely on prepackaged meals, I try to do it in moderation and cook when I can. 
When we go to &quot;town&quot; (60 miles away) we do the drive-through both for 
the speed and convenience in a full day of errands and because it's a treat. 
Third, we need to teach our children TOLERANCE for other ways of doing things 
and for other opinions, FLEXIBILITY in the way we live, and MODERATION in all 
things. Amen!</p>  November 30, 2011 at 2:54 pm | </li> </ul> </li>

<p>JEEZ. There are some SNOBBY people on this forum. My husband and I have two 
kids, and we both are enrolled in college full time and my husband also works a 
full time job on top of that. Depending on the hours of my classes, I can plan 
meals for my family, but there is NO way in hell I would point my finger at 
these so called bad parents for making one night a little less hectic than 
usual for popping in a pizza or hopping through the drive through. You people 
should be ashamed of yourselves for all the nitpicky behavior. You know what a 
bad parent is? The woman who drowned all 5 of her kids in a bathtub, or the one 
who drove her car off the side of a bridge into a river or better yet, the mom 
who microwaved her newborn. How about the parents that duct taped their 3 year 
old, videotaped it, and then laughed when they yanked it off her skin. How 
about that 19 year old dad who shook his child to death? Seriously. You have NO 
idea what a bad parent is. No, I don't go to McDonald's on a daily basis, I use 
it as a treat for my children, but don't bash parents who can't live in your 
Normal Rockwell nightmare you call a life.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 1:59 pm |

<li> <strong>Richard</strong> <br>

<p>Courtney I agree with you 100%. People are snobby. And college is hectic, 
it makes you do things you sure aren't proud of, food wise that is. Anything 
that can make life easier I go for, so the pizza in the oven, good thing for 
many college students. Or anyother frozen thing that is quick to make, if 
people just pay attention to what they are eating in them they can be worked 
into a diet that isn't really that bad for you. Everything in a diet works 
together. People you don't get fat from eating any particular food, it the 
entire diet that must be assessed.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 2:28 pm | </li> 
<li> <strong>Jorge</strong> <br>

<p>No excuse, popping stripped chicken breasts and bag veggies (frozen) with 
mushroom sauce and bacon bits in the oven takes as long as a pizza, and is ten 
times as good for you and your family (more protein, more vitamins, more 
minerals, more flavor) and since when does it take that much time to eat 
strawberries with sugar-free whipped frosting or pineapple? Face it, you just 
have bad eating habits.</p>  December 1, 2011 at 7:55 am | </li> </ul> </li>

 My kids were amazed when they left home and found out that soup is

<p>Boy.... lots of judgement out there. And lots of people missing the point 
of the article. Some of us not only don't have much time (like those of us who 
are full-time working single moms), and would prefer to spend it interacting 
with our children rather than pushing them away so we can get a home-cooked 
meal on the table in the half-hour available between getting home from work and 
the store and starting the bedtime routine.... some of us look at all those 
ingredients and just can't come up with what to do with them. I have a shelf 
full of cookbooks, I learned to cook as a child, I can make wonderful meals if 
I really put my mind to it... but I simply am incapable of coming up with a 
well-planned, healthy meal on a daily basis without a huge amount of thought 
and effort. I also live in a very small town where ingredients are not always 
available and the store actually closes in the evening. So yes &ndash; I rely a 
certain amount of the time on prepared meals and every now and then (gasp!) on 
pizza from the convenience store (we have no McD<br>
 s here). I am not a bad 
parent. I am a GOOD parent because I teach my son to do the best we can, and 
more importantly, that I value time spent with him, that I am available to help 
him with homework or listen about his day, that he can participate in 
activities even though I have to work a lot, etc. .... The real answer to this 
issue is for food companies to make, and stores to sell, truly healthy 
pre-packaged meals for people like me.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 1:24 pm |

<p>One approach to this problem is to do most of the week's prep on a single 
day, say Sunday. Of course, what you'll wind up with is a large pile of 
'pre-prepared' food, but I guess there's some strange difference between food 
you pre-prepare yourself and food pre-prepared by someone else.</p> 
<p>Seriously, I just don't see what the problem is here. If it's easier to 
grab a handful of pre-shredded lettuce for a salad and it means the difference 
between having a salad and not having one at all, grab that handful and enjoy 
it. You haven't done anything wrong.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 6:06 pm | </li>

<p>I was lucky enough to be raised in a household where my parents did, in 
fact, cook fresh and healthy meals for our family most nights of the week. I am 
now lucky enough that I have a job that allows me to cook nutritious meals most 
nights of the week. I think it's important to remember, however, that some are 
not so fortunate.</p> 
<p>There is a significant health-wealth gradient in our country today, and 
food plays largely into this picture. Many children are raised in single-parent 
households, and in order to keep a roof over their head, clothes on their back 
and food in their belly, parents have to work long hours that often don't allow 
for entirely homemade meals. In todays economic climate, even living in a 
household with two parents far from guarantees that there will be someone 
around to spend time cooking, as oftentimes both parents have to work. And yes, 
it would be ideal to cook on the weekends and freeze this food for the week, 
but some parents have to work on the weekends as well, just to survive.</p> 
<p>Hungry individuals are looking for the &quot;most bang for their 
buck&quot;, so to speak. If you're forced to feed a family on a very tight 
budget, high caloric content paired with low price is this &quot;bang&quot;. 
Yes, it's sad that high sodium ramen costs merely cents while salad fixings and 
lean meat cost significantly more, but such is the current state of affairs. 
Additionally, many cities have zoning regulations that result in poor areas 
filled with fast-food restaurants but no supermarkets. If transportation is an 
issue, it's no surprise that dinner often comes from the nearby McDonald's 
rather than from the Stop and Shop miles away.</p> 
<p>We should not condone eating prepared or fast foods, but we certainly must 
take into account other factors before we condemn it.</p>  November 30, 2011 at

<p>Go to rural places in any country. They are lot healthier with less 
doctors. They eat natural foods and it is as simple as that. Even in America, 
talk to older genetaiion. They will explain you what they ate.</p>  November 
30, 2011 at 12:24 pm | 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Eliza Clark</strong> <br>

<p>There are recent studies that show that many rural areas, particularly in 
the south, have poorer nutrition because there are fewer transportation 
options, smaller stores with much worse selection of healthy and fresh foods, 
and yet still the preponderance of fast foods and convenience stores. Obesity 
rates are higher in the rural south than anywhere else.</p>  November 30, 2011

<li> <strong>SixDegrees</strong> <br>

<p>Well, there are certainly fewer doctors and health care facilities. The

<li> <strong>Kristin</strong> <br>

<p>This issue has nothing to do with one parent feeling superior or better 
than another. It's quite simply an issue of the deterioration of our food 
culture and the industrialization of food. If you look at the French, the 
Italians, the Greeks they all spend significantly more money and time shopping, 
preparing and eating their food. They are all demonstrably healthier than 
Americans with lower rates of obesity and cancer. Relying on fast food and 
prepackaged meals is a cop out. It's a cop out because we as a society need to 
fundamentally realign the way we think about food and eating. Don't pull the 
tired, working mother card. There are millions of tired working mothers who 
make it a priority to feed themselves and their families well. It just takes a 
bit more planning and organization. It's well worth putting in the time at the 
outset rather than paying more in health care costs and premiums down the road.

<p>Those cultures also have shorter work days than most Americans, have more 
sick/family leave time than most Americans, and come from strongly family 
oriented cultures where there are many generations of the same family living in 
the same house. These factors allow them to have healthier, more frequently 
home cooked meals because their entire culture and society supports it, unlike 
in the U.S.<br>
 It's not laziness or a cop out when you're a single parent 
working two jobs just to make your child even has food to eat and making sure 
they have everything else they need.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 3:45 pm | </li>

<p>Ive been a vegetarian for 5 years and both my husband and I worked very 
busy jobs in higher education. Every Sunday afternoon I'd prep and cook for the 
week so we were eating healthy lunches and had healthy dinners when we came 
home. We don't go out to eat that much or buy anything pre packaged food. If I 
want Mac and cheese I don't use a box, I make it from scratch. But these are my 
choices. When my daughter starts school she will be running circles around all 
the McDonalds babies. You want to love your kids? Don't give them TV, video 
games, cellphones, etc. My daughter sits in the kitchen and cooks with me. My 
husband helps. It's a family thing, as it should be. Buying frozen veggies, 
packaged salads, precut carrots is no big deal. Buying chef boyardee or tv 
dinners is. Make a peanut butter sandwich on whole grain bread before you zap 
on of those frozen poison bricks</p>  November 30, 2011 at 11:01 am |

fact that not everyone lives like them. Honestly people, from the begining of 
time every parent thinks they are right and every parent after them will think 
their way is better. I don't even want to write this comment anymore honestly 
its disgusting to read the nit picky crap people bicker about. Especially when 
the point of the article (at least to me) is to each their own. Anyway, I think

<p>Sorry, but if you feed your children McDonald's more than occasionally and 
give them TV dinners (Healthy Choice, Lean Cuisine, etc.) several times a week, 
then, yes, you are a bad parent. If, however, you COOK using minced garlic, 
canned tomatoes, frozen (unseasoned) vegetables), boxed rice (preferably 
brown), etc. like this author mostly suggests, then you are a normal, concerned 
person. I have no kids, but my husband and I cook regularly, mostly using fresh 
ingredients but sometimes using canned or frozen. We stay away from fast food 
(except on occasion, like last night) and boxed meals because they are LOADED 
with sodium and other horrible preservatives, hydrogenated oils, etc. An easy 
and quick meal, however, doesn't have to be unhealthy. We love bagged salads 
and making our own pizza with fresh veggies. We also make DELICIOUS and 
NUTRITIOUS soups from canned beans, canned tomatoes, low sodium &quot;stock in 
a box,&quot; and a fewfresh ingredients&ndash;and lots of stuff (healthy 
chilli, red beans &amp; rice, etc.) can be frozen. Be sensible. The closer to 
natural it is, the healthier it is (generally), but it's OK to substitute SOME 
canned/frozen/etc. ingredients. And pretty much anything (even typically 
unhealthy stuff like hamburgers, pizza, mac &amp; cheese, fried chicken, etc.) 
is better for you when cooked at home rather than bought in box-shaped chain 
&quot;restaurant.&quot; Tips for busy parents: cook meals on the weekend and

<p>It's so amusing how people who can't handle scheduling their life with kids 
always want to b*,?!h to the people without kids how hard it is! Boo f-ing hoo, 
you made the decision to have children, deal with it. I work more ot a week 
because co workers have to leave to go take care of their kids so those of us 
without kids are constantly picking up the slack. I somehow manage to juggle a 
full 60+ hour work week, college classes, flight classes, skit trips, fishing 
trips ect ect and still manage to come home and cook almost every meal. There 
is nothing wrong with the occasional grabbing something fast here and there and 
by all means get your kids a pizza once in a while, but really, your kids are 
that much that you can't cook dinner??? That's the sad slope America is going, 
excuses for everything! My parents lived their lives very much the way I do 
now, with both of then working full time, one in school too, all well running 
our family orchard and raising 3 kids, it probably worked so well because they 
planned ahead and made us part of their lives and activities, and a large part 
of that was helping to cook!! I see so many people who pick there kids up from 
school or daycare, bring them home, and let them park it format of the tv or 
some video game, instead of having their kids help them. You wanted to be a 
parent,grow up and act like one instead of acting like the whining adult who 
uses having a child as an excuse for everything. And stop acting like your life 
is so much more hectic then the rest of ours, its not, you just choose to make 
it that way with your attitudes!!</p>  November 30, 2011 at 6:20 pm |

<p>I think the confusion here really is about if we're taking the shortcuts on 
prepared otherwise &quot;healthy&quot; food (e.g. the bagged salad) or if we 
are really making the choices that include only fast food, and heat-and-serve 
foods.</p> 
<p>A lot of things fall somewhere in between... I almost feel like you can 
balance the &quot;evil&quot; of a marginal time-assist food with other items. 
For instance, we might choose to do frozen chicken nuggets one night with my 2 
year old. To offset the assumed additional sodiums and whatnot from using that 
convenience, I'll serve with steamed fresh vegetables, and maybe a rice or 
noodle (not a packaged, sauced variety). Do not follow with dessert every 
night. All I can say is that so far this kind of thinking has steered us well; 
none of my household is overweight or unhealthy.</p>  November 30, 2011 at

<p>Katia, not only do I understand the challenges you face everyday, even as a 
cookbook author, I experience similar real life challenges of the weekday time 
crunch, hungry kids that need to be fed fast in 5 minutes on the way to soccer, 
or not having time to prep something completely from scratch. The first thing 
we moms should scratch off the list is our guilt &ndash; that we're not good 
enough or doing enough for our families. Your child will remember the time you 
took to look her in the eye and talk about her day at school more than she'll 
remember the fact that you started the chicken recipe from scratch.<br>

<p>For my part, I think buying some precut carrots or salad bags might not 
doom the entire household. Further, heck, a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce 
just might pop open at my house on any given week. I get it that it's &quot;not 
hard&quot; to make sauce from scratch, but when I leave the house at 7:30 am, 
return no earlier than 6, and have tiny children to contend with when I do, let 
me know if it's a sin I didn't stay up till midnight to make it, and chose to 
try to interact and play with my kids instead. And as they are both under the 
age of 3, getting them involved in the cooking right now is rather limited at 
best- perhaps not even wise when we're talking about hot stoves being 
instrumental! As a matter of fact, my husband and I take pains to cook nice 
meals on weekends and have become quite the weekend foodies. So judge not 
during the weekday marathons, because not everyone is blessed with the close 
commute or extra time to do everything perfectly. Some of us are just trying to 
get by the best we can!</p>  November 30, 2011 at 9:28 am | </li>

<p>Yes... you are a bad parent if you do not cook/bake for your children from 
scratch. Processed food is ok on an occasion but if you have not noticed... the 
kids and people in general are getting fatter which is not healthy. Teach your 
kids something so they can function and not be depended on thier parents and 
the government forever. It is time for America to wake up. Stop being lazy. 
Stop using the excuse that you are &quot;busy&quot;. It is laughable.</p>

<p>Our children are in the kitchen every night with us and THAT is our 
priority. They are 4 and 5 and can be quite helpful and learn a lot in the 
process. Have them get ingredients from the fridge or spice rack. Have them 
line up items according to size or sort them by category. They help count and 
measure. We think of rhyming words. We learn and talk and it is my favorite 
part of our evening together. This is our CHOICE.</p>  November 30, 2011 at

<p>Our weekday dinners usually consist of one frozen skillet meal (frozen 
veggies, noodles, chicken, and some random sauce), on day of veggie 
burgers/fake chicken patty sandwich with fruit and baby carrots, one day of 
spaghetti with frozen meatballs or precooked chicken and mixed veggies, one day 
of veggie pizza and cut fruit, and one day of a random frozen meal with 
veggies. Yeah, not great, but every meal has a serving of vegetables, every day 
has a serving of fruit, and I use whole grains when possible. We make up for it 
with breakfasts and snacks that are more wholesome.</p> 
<p>I'd love to have more time.. We get home around 6, bedtime is at 7:30- I 
want the time we have to be spent playing board games, talking, joking, going 
for a walk, whatever. Meaningful time after a long day. Not spending every 
evening cooking a fabulous organic dinner and then hand washing pots and pans.

<p>One can also not help but notice you are up at 3am, likely being 
unproductive. It doesn't take much to prepare healthy meals. I'm in my mid 
twenties, and pack a lunch every single day for myself and my boyfriend. 
There's no reason to be buying overpriced processed crap, when it just takes a 
bit of planning. Dinners can be a little harder to be creative, but again, 
there's no reason to be buying frozen processed chicken and beef. You can buy 
all those things fresh, give them a nice merinade, throw em in the pan and 
you're ready to go in less than 20 minutes. Pre-cut your veggies at 3am since 
you're awake anyway, and you won't need to be using flimsy frozen veggies, 
which also cost double the price. There's only 24 hours in a day, and you 
choose not to feed your kids healthy food because you'd rather be playing bored 
games?</p>  November 30, 2011 at 9:18 am |

<p>I'm downhearted thinking that you don't see the precious opportunities 
slipping away by not allowing your children to learn to cook along with you. 
Sad as well, that you are bribing them with TV, rather than demonstrating 
patience for them to model. Or, better still, making the most of that time so 
that you all don't miss the chance to be together, for learning/practicing 
fundamental math skills while measuring and combining ingredients, for 
introducing them to other cultures and traditions, helping them to learn how to 
take care of themselves and others by crafting delicious and nutritious meals, 
and perhaps, most importantly, letting them learn from your example how to 
gracefully &ndash; even humorously! &ndash; accept a situation when it doesn't 
turn out as you have hoped. Not to mention the mmmgoodness of eating healthful 
foods that were prepared by your own hands. I do wish you happy, memorable time

Make it as much natural and pure as you can. My husband is Italian and he would 
die if he sees someone putting this much of sugar. I learn from him how to cook 
pasta sauce, and believe me you do not need more than a small, tiny pinch of 
sugar. And onion powder? -just choped small onion and saut&eacute; before

<p>...Or you could open a jar of Ragu and add it to the cooked pasta (yes, I 
do use whole wheat mixed with the whole grain so it doesn't taste like 
cardboard)...no hour there, much cheaper than all those ingredients you listed 
and more time at the dinner table to spend with the family. I honestly don't 
have most of those ingredients you listed, and spices run $3 &ndash; $4 per 
jar. Ragu is a buck and a half. I simply don't have the time or money to spend 
on all those ingredients, then cook the sauce from scratch. I will however, add 
onion and bell pepper to the sauce. Maybe a can of tuna and some olives to the 
spaghetti.</p>  November 30, 2011 at 3:51 pm | </li> </ul> </li>

First of all, while I understand all the points being made here, she didn't say 
anything about having processed food every day. She was defending pre-packaged 
foods, which is really very different.<br>
 Second of all, just because a

in the slightest that they are bad parents&ndash;it means that aspect of

<p>Priorities are odd. Everyone has their own value system. My mother 
admittedly didn't learn to cook until she had to when she married my father. I, 
on the other hand, decided as a broke college student that I would absolutely 
have to learn unless I wanted to die a slow sodium filled death to ramen 
(which, when made the official way, is actually quite good for you! Add miso, 
mushrooms, a hard boiled egg, good to go, also, dashi isn't hard to make at 
all). However, as easy as it is to beget a child these days, it is much harder 
to care for one. and *gasp*, did you know you can decide whether or not to have 
them?! And when?! Holy kitty litter batman! I think the best we can do for the 
future generations is to remove ourselves from the agricultural system as it 
stands now. Grow our own food, cook with the food we grow. It's not hard, but 
it requires space, money, and time. Something most people don't bother to put 
in place before popping out a few. Just sayin'. I eat well, and if/when I 
choose to have kids, they will get their hands dirty growing their own food and 
be learning how to cook and enjoy it at a young age. Just because everything is 
urbanized and grocery-store centered doesn't mean kids should forget where food 
comes from, the joy that comes from watching it grow, imbibing it with your own 
positive energy, and then getting to imbibe that energy back tenfold with the 
food that comes from it. I don't own a microwave and I'm proud of that.</p>

<p>Just wait until mountains of laundry come your way when you grow those

<li> <strong>Just Here</strong> <br>

<p>you know, Cella, when I 'popped out a few', I was married and in a position 
where I could stay home to raise my kids. We had a fairly successful home 
business. I was able to cook good meals. What your idealistic view doesn't 
include is when a marriage dissolves, or a spouse dies, then there is only ONE 
parent to do everything. It affects finances, emotions of both kids and 
parent(s), as well as time factors. I for one, have wanted to start my own 
garden for the past two years, but I dont have the money for it, or the time to 
prepare the small amount of yard I have. Please live a little more life before 
you make blanket statements like that. By the way, I dont own a microwave 
either, but that is personal choice, and I dont condemn those who rely on them.

they are or even do.diet colas still contain sacharin and nutrasweet even 
though it has been known for 30 years both cause cancer.for the past 40 yrs 
they told u margarine with all that trans fat was better.is anyone aware the 
columbine massacre was caused by adhd medication?zoloft to be exact.but they 
list marijuana as a more dangerous drug than cocaine.they changed the 
definition of the word drug to fit marijuana in that category.todays definition 
is a mind altering substance.the original definition is man made medication

<p>Not everyone can cook thats true, and with the better choices available for 
preprepared &quot;fresh&quot; foods a quick healthy meal can be made in very 
little time. I personally could not eat this preprepared rubbish as I do know 
how to cook and can put together a quick meal in about the same time as it 
takes to heat a cheese laden sodium filled pizza.</p> 
<p>And for emergencies where we run short of time I have several home made TV 
dinners in the freezer that are far better and cheaper than any bought tv 
dinner. As an example I have vac packed slow cooked beef cheeks ready to put on 
top of some pasta, ready in about 15-20 mins and cost $8 to feed our family of 
four.</p>

<p>It doesn't mean you are a bad parent, it means you are a terrible parent 
that doesn't care about the nutrition or upbringing of your child. Take a look 
a TV dinner and tell me how many of the ingrediants you can pronounce. How much 
sodium is in that can of Chef Boyardee. And then you put it in a microwave and 
bombard it with long wave length radiation that heats the food by accelerating 
and breaking up the particles in it. Yeah, you're a great parent. Look up the 
origin of microwaves, they were originally developed as a weapon by Raytheon at 
the end of WWII. By the time they were done, the war was over. They needed to 
recover their R&amp;D money, so they marketed it to housewives to cook food 
faster.</p> 
<p>No, I will feed my family real food, from real sources. You can/will do 
what you want. Think about it, you get food like this because you can't be

<p>Actually, I've never had a problem pronouncing any word I've seen on a

<p>I didn't get from the article that the author was all about fast food and 
junk every day. It was more about using the pre cut fresh stuff that's 
avaliable more and more. What's wrong with buying a rotisserie chicken from the

<li> <strong>Laura</strong> <br>

<p>As a chemist, I so strongly dislike the argument that ingredients you 
cannot pronounce are bad. Just because you cannot pronounce an ingredient, does 
not make it unnatural or dangerous. If you take an egg, you can break it down 
into egg yolk and egg white. But what happens when you start isolating some of 
the compounds in the egg? They start to get hard to pronounce. The public does 
not generally care about isolated compounds generally and to giving a common 
name to every one of these compounds would be completely and utterly ridiculous 
due to sheer amount there are. These compounds are not given large, scary names 
to scare the public or keep them ignorant. There is a standard way to name 
molecules so that, if given a name of a molecule, a chemist can draw the 
molecule. And, if given the structure of a molecule, a chemist can name it.</p> 
<p>On the flip-side, there are many things with easy-to-pronounce, common 
names that are worse for you than the scientific named items.</p> 
<p>If you prefer to eat foods that you can pronounce, that is your perogative. 
Personally, I look at the ingredient labels on everything. and I will chuck it 
if it contains things like hydrogenated oils. But to call a parent terrible 
because they do not buy into the hype/paranoia that a scientific name means you 
are eating something bad is very rude and ignorant on your part. I will grant 
you that it is a good idea to know what you are eating, and not having common 
names for everything does make this more difficult for the average person.</p> 
<p>I will agree that sodium tends to be extreme in these kinds of products, 
but there are options out there that are reasonable. She mention's Amy's in the 
article, and that is a brand that focuses on organic, natural ingredients.</p>

<p>I also CANNOT believe people feed their children food that was cooked in an 
OVEN! An OVEN! Look it up &ndash; Nazi Germany murdered innocent people in 
OVENS! And people want to feed their children food that was cooked in an 
oven?!? Ovens heat your food, which causes the molecules to ACCELERATE and

<p>Cooking is not hard or time-consuming, so those who say they don't know how 
are just using it as an excuse unless they are blind, deaf, and/or illiterate. 
It's not hard to boil some whole grain spaghetti, top it with pre-made sauce 
(or even better, chop up some tomatoes and basil you grow yourself), and bake 
some garlic bread. It's not hard to throw some chicken, fish, or meat in the 
oven/stovetop/grill/crockpot. Grow veggies in your yard or in pots during the 
summer. Frozen veggies are cheap and nutritious, too. I don't see how it takes 
away from your family, either. My daughter loves to help me water and pick the 
veggies in the summer and is really interested in cooking. During the school 
year, she sits at the table doing homework while I or my husband cook 
(sometimes both) when we get home. I like that she sees me preparing food and 
will be able to fend for herself, plus we still get to chat about her day. That 
doesn't mean we don't have pizza or takeout from time to time, but it's not the 
norm.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 4:48 pm |

<p>My supermarket was offering tastes of what they called &quot;5 can 
soup&quot;. Actually, quite tasty and as a bonus, cheap and easy to prepare.</p>
<p>1 can tomato soup<br>
 1 can chili with beans<br>
 1 can diced tomato with 
green chili<br>
 1 can corn; drained<br>
 1 can peas and carrots; drained<br>
 
&ndash;simmer all ingredients together for 20-30 minutes. (I felt I needed to 
add some water because it was too thick).<br>
 Great with grilled cheese!</p> 
<p>My other savior is the crock pot. Dinner cooks while you are at work and 
ready when you get home!</p>  November 29, 2011 at 4:45 pm |

<p>Super easy and delicious::<br>
 4 Bonless skinless chicken breasts<br>
 
Instant Brown Rice (and water and butter according to box)<br>
 Fresh Broccolli 
Florets<br>
 2% Shredded Cheddar cheese (Lucerne is good)<br>
 Garlic salt and 
Pepper</p> 
<p>I season chicken both sides with Garlic Salt and Pepper. Put in Baking 
dish, add brown rice (enough for 4 servings) (and water and butter according to 
box). Add Broccolli and bake in Oven for at 375 F for about 30 minuetes covered 
with tinfoil. Halfway through, stir the rice and broccoli. At 25 minuets check 
for doneness of chicken. Remove foil and add cheddar cheese on top 5 &ndash; 10 
minuetes prior to removing from oven.</p> 
<p>This is super delicous, I don't have kids but everyone I know with kids 
enjoys this recipe and appreciate how simple it is! I usually serve this with a 
bag of salad and low fat ranch.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 4:44 pm |

<p>We created our artificial preservative free, 10 grain pizza as part of the 
solution. We have delivery/carryout stores and frozen. The recognition that 
health, value, convenience and taste can live together. And while the solutions 
(like ours) and the means are pregnant with compromise, it's worth finding 
options to help us navigate the complexity of feeding ourselves and our kids in 
a way that we can afford and live with. Important that we all keep turning this 
engagement into possible solutions, the best of which, will live by the 
decisions of the market.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 4:28 pm |

<p>Pre-prepared meals don't have to be bad. I can think of lots of examples of 
things that are healthy- rotisserie chickens, salad bars, pre-chopped veggies, 
etc. So no, people aren't bad parents just because they serve pre-prepared food.
</p> 
<p>The problem is that many people eat frozen or pre-packaged foods that are 
heavily processed and contain ingredients that aren't really supposed to go in 
our bodies. Sure, you don't notice the effects now, but they can cause problems 
later, like cancer, dental problems, heart problems, etc.</p> 
<p>I grew up in a house where my mother didn't work, but hated to cook. 
However, she made fresh, simple meals every night. I don't think she ever spent 
more than an hour makiing dinner. I currently work a ten hour day but make 
dinner every night- I have learned to become efficient about 
shopping/planning/preparing. A few years ago I read &quot;In Defense of 
Food&quot; by Michael Pollan and it changed my life- I cut out most processed 
foods. In the process I've learned how incredibly easy it is to make lots of 
dishes from scratch.</p> 
<p>I don't think that parents who hate cooking but buy healthful pre-prepared 
foods are being lazy- as long as what the kids eat is healthy I see no problem 
with it! I just wish people would stop seeing cooking as being something so 
awful/scary.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 3:54 pm | </li>

<p>Another idea for very quick, inexpensive weeknight meals &ndash; though 
this one takes a little planning:</p> 
<p>Get a bag of individually wrapped, frozen fish filets (like tilapia or 
salmon). The night before, take one from the freezer and put it in your fridge. 
It'll be thawed by the time you get home at night (or, you could defrost it in 
the microwave, but that sometimes starts it cooking). Spray a little cooking 
spray on your nonstick frying pan, toss in the fish, add a squirt of lemon and 
some dill or whatever (I like cayenne and lime juice on tilapia), and you'll 
have a good, healthy protein even quicker than your microwave meal would be 
ready. Combine that with some leftover rice, or a microwaved baked potato, and 
some veggies. 10 minutes, tops, and that includes washing the pan.</p> 
<p>Come to think of it, I may do that tonight.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 3:43

<p>Don't forget frozen veggies if you're in a hurry. They're nutritionally 
just about the same as fresh, and usually pretty cheap if you get store brand. 
Just skip the kind that have sauce all over them. Canned corn is good, too. (I 
don't like other canned vegetables, but I guess that's personal taste.)</p>

<p>Agree with OP &amp; the &quot;get over it&quot; crowd. Monday I arrived at 
work 5:45am &amp; left at 9:30pm, today I started at 6:30am and will be here 
until at least 8pm. I *love* to cook &ndash; but I walk in the door at night 
with less than 8 hours before I have to walk out again, sorry &ndash; I'm going 
straight to bed, not to the kitchen.</p> 
<p>Breakfast is usually a yogurt I grab from home and a granola bar from the 
box at my desk. Lunch is leftovers from weekend cooking if I'm lucky (again 
grab&amp;go only) or whatever the cafeteria is serving. Dinner? McD 
cheeseburger &amp; a bag of apple slices, delivery pizza, etc. Ideal? No of 
course not. But it is what it is.</p> 
<p>I'm lucky to have a job that I really enjoy (no I don't get overtime pay). 
On the rare weeknight that I actually am home by 6pm, dinner is usually just a 
bowl of cereal because there's mail to sort, bathrooms to clean, laundry to 
run, and a thousand other things. I probably only cook two or three times in an 
entire month.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 3:29 pm |

<p>On occasion, I make the $1 8-9 oz frozen meals (Banquet, Michaelina's, 
Marie Callendar's Chicken Pot Pie bought in 8 packs at Costco) and they're more 
healthy than typical alternatives like a ham and cheese sandwich with potato 
chips. If you need to stay low in sodium, Healthy Choice is more expensive, but 
reasonable, and also healthy.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 3:15 pm | </li>

<p>Poor Man's Chili</p> 
<p>2 lbs regular or hot breakfast sausage (not maple)<br>
 4 great big cans of 
ranch style beans</p> 
<p>In a large pot, crumble and brown the sausage like you would ground beef. 
Add beans and heat through. Voila, chili! Serve with a buffet of shredded 
cheese, chopped onions, green chile (I like 505 brand), tortillas, cornbread, 
sour cream...anything you and yours like on chili.</p> 
<p>I like this recipe because it's fast and the leftovers freeze well. You can 
also serve over chips with melted cheese for nachos. My husband thinks it makes 
a great Frito pie...although we differ on the flavor aesthetics of that dish. 
:) it's also a good last-minute company meal; serve it at that impromptu Super 
Bowl party!</p> 
<p>(I buy the cheese and onions already shredded and chopped. I myself hate 
serving dinner at 8:45 pm, and I'm not about to miss Burn Notice or The Walking 
Dead for something so mundane as cooking! :D )</p>  November 29, 2011 at 3:15

<p>I think that learning to prepare healthy, home-cooked meals is an 
essential. People shouldn't eat out or eat pre-packaged, overly processed foods 
all the time. However, for those who don't always have the time to cook 
something at home, I think it's reasonable to allow room for eating out, or 
eating a 5-minute frozen dinner once in a while. I don't see anything wrong 
with having that stuff occasionally, if necessary. But it's important to eat 
MOSTLY what is actually good for you, and to limit the stuff that's not. So 
sometimes is all right&ndash;just not every day.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 2:37

<p>I think it's fine to purchase pre packaged foods, but it is cheaper to buy 
and package yourself. I understand it's about saving time, but a lot of people 
right now are looking for the CHEAPER way to cook dinner.</p>  November 29, 
2011 at 2:24 pm | 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>FigureItOut</strong> <br>

<p>Cheaper? Here you go. A pack of organic chicken breasts is $10. A fresh 
vegetable is anywhere from $3-4. A cup of rice, quinoa, beans or whatever is 
$2. Total prices? $15. For that, my wife, son and I eat dinner. My wife and I 
BOTH take leftovers for lunch the next day. So for about $3.50 a serving, we've 
all eaten healthy from a meal that took me 30 minutes to prepare. I can't even 
get a #4 Value Meal for under five bucks.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 2:28 pm |

far cheaper than your organic food, and feeds my family of 4 dinner, and lunch

<li> <strong>A@Observer</strong> <br>

<p>What part of balance don't you get? Not one parent in here is saying that 
feeding your kids processed foods for EVERY meal is a good thing, what the 
argument is is that sometimes, NOT ALL THE TIME, it's nice to have a quick and 
easy fix. I feed my kid fish sticks that I get in the grocery store, but I pair 
it with fresh vegetables and a healthy starch. Does it make me a bad parent 
because I don't go and but more expensive fillets of fish, hand-bread them, and 
fry them myself? No, it makes me someone who uses their time logically while 
still trying to get wholesome food into my kid. Pretty soon the argument will 
be, &quot;You don't raise and slaughter all your own meat??? What an 
irresponsible and lazy parent you are!!!!&quot; Get off your high horse.</p>

do all of my shopping within two hours on Sunday and prepare 5 out of 6 dinners 
in the crockpot before I head out to work one of my two jobs each morning. I'm 
sorry, but it's laziness to say this can't be done. Don't like to cook? Tough.

<p>FigureItOut, how condescending and myopic can you be? You clearly are the 
Chuck Norris of food prep and general parenting. Your sweeping and uninformed 
generalizations about how others should parent and what makes a good parent are 
shocking. It sounds like you have one child (hopefully a healthy one) to feed 
and a wife. My wife and I both work full days and come home to a special needs 
child (muscular dystrophy) and triplet girls that are 2 1/2 years old. My wife 
and I spend ten times the amount of time that you spend cooking up your Emeril 
dishes for your family bringing our son to therapies and doctors and trying to 
manage raising triplet girls at the same time. Yet according to you, if I give 
my kids a processed meal I'm a poor parent? Anyone on this board that is 
criticizing people that you don't know based on some perception of what is 
right in your mind needs to walk a mile in other people's shoes to see what 
their situation allows for comparatively. This kind of my way or the highway 
attitude steams me up (no pun intended, Mr. Norris).</p>  November 29, 2011 at

<p>Doesn't even have to be a crockpot meal per se. On Saturday or Sunday I 
plan dinners for the week and shop. I chop veggies and prep ingredients for the 
next night's meal after my daughter is in bed (15 minutes?). Usually can have 
dinner on the table within 30-45 minutes of getting home on a weeknight. I love 
to cook, but weeknights are easy-cooking nights. As a working mom, I also keep 
ingredients for go-to quick meals on hand in case planned dinners fall through 
for some reason or time runs short. A bag of frozen salmon filets from Costco 
(salt, pepper, butter, broil for a few minutes&ndash;bam!); frozen vegetables 
(we use frozen veggies a lot); whole wheat spaghetti (pre-packaged sauce, but I 
try to get the low sugar kind); etc. We also typically do pizza once a week, 
and yes, we do occasionally hit the drive through. My 2.5 year old also loves 
to &quot;help&quot; me (usually I measure ingredients and let her dump them in 
the bowl), so cooking time = spending time with daughter. Where there's a will, 
there's a way.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 3:07 pm | </li> 
<li> <strong>Eric</strong> <br>

<p>Seriously. My wife and I cook nearly all of our food. Our crock pot gets a 
lot of use making healthy stews and soups, and we can easily eat for days just 
from one batch. We don't have as active a &quot;social&quot; life as a lot of 
people we know, but our priorities lie in staying healthy and saving money. We 
have a baby and laundry and all the other chores busy people have, but we find 
the time. People who say they don't have time to cook probably don't try to 
make time&ndash;they while it away with their social media friends or zone out 
in front of the TV or whatever, believing those things are essential to their 
lifestyle and sense of self. If that's not a clear depiction of the 
infantilization of society, I don't know what is.</p>  November 29, 2011 at

hazard a guess that others are simply already stretched past the point of 
breaking, and nothing short of completely restructuring their lives is going to 
make adding another time cost feasible. That's too bad though, especially

cooking entire meals from scratch intimidating and time consuming, and cooking 
larger batches at one time is by far a great way to plan ahead, especially if 
you know you have a busy few days coming up! I cam also easily say a lot of the 
people I know that &quot;are too busy&quot; to cook, are also the same ones 
that pick the kids up, hit McD's on the way home and park their butts in fro t

<p>I grew up with at least one home-cooked meal at home (during the school 
year) and def on the weekends and holidays. My mom worked for a while in the 
evening and dad was in the military. There was three of us. How did they 
manage. Easy, as we got older we were assigned dinner duty. We were to provide 
a healthy meal (veggie, meat, starch etc.) that we either could cook or wanted 
to try. due to that all of us can and will cook good meals. Now me and my 
brother love to cook though my sister not so much. I will admit though if I am 
in a bind, hambrger helper and mac and cheese work well, but they are not every 
night.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 2:10 pm | </li>

<p>I don't see the problem with the food this author talks about serving. 
bagged salad isn't any different than buying a head of lettuce and cutting it 
yourself. Buying garlic already minced is a lot faster than having to peel and 
chop a clove each time you need it. Amy's pizza is organic, and not that bad 
for you.</p>

<p>Sorry but I think this article is pathetic. For years my family ate 
processed foods and suffered physically because of it. My wife works 60 hours a 
week and so do I. We have two kids who are in sports and I, the father, still 
manage to cook meals with fresh ingrediants just about every day. Yes we do eat 
Mcdonalds once a month and occasionally there is that prepackaged meal. But 
quite frankly it is a cop out to say I am too busy to cook healthy meals. You 
have to plan ahead and buy ahead and practice cooking, you will get better over 
time. The so called too busy problem is why we have so many over weight people 
with diabetes in this country. Watch less TV, spend less time on the computer 
and other gadgets. Spend more time talking with your kids, playing sports with 
your kids and cooking. Stop making excuses and man and woman up!</p>  November

<p>Dear shortsighted people, please get over yourselves. Balance is the key. 
Please stop beating mothers up for their choices. I believe that every parent 
makes the best choices that they can in that moment with the information and 
time that they have at hand. Food choices is obviously a polarizing discussion, 
beginning when a baby is born. &quot;Breast is best&quot; has become such a 
rallying cry that mothers who choose not to nurse are almost forced to go 
underground with that choice because our society has such an attitude of 
&quot;persecute the parent&quot;. McDonalds is not child abuse. A cheeseburger 
costs a dollar. Organic salad costs three or more. Some parents make the choice 
to fill their children up with warm food that they can afford... that doesn't 
make them a monster. When a parent has time to throw ingredients in a crock 
pot, wonderful. I have two crock pots and numerous slow cooker recipes that 
don't require a million ingredients. I use these on the weekends to get a jump 
on the wheek whenever possible. But on the days when I have to work a double 
shift and my 3 year is screaming because no one will help her put on her shoes 
and my baby is trying to eat Vaseline and I am doing my best not to scream at 
my other beloved children &quot;Get in the darned car!&quot;, you had better

<p>That's pretty rude. I totally agree with her. I work full-time and I know 
exactly what she is talking about. Honestly, I hate to cook and do not enjoy it 
one bit. I guess that makes me a horrible mother, right? I don't think so. You 
do what you feel is the best decision at the time and don't look back. You 
can't tell me that someone is a horrible parent because they get fast food for 
dinner or bust out the frozen food. There is a lot more to being a parent than 
cooking a homemade meal at night.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 1:21 pm | </li>

<p>Right...and there's a whole lot more to poor health than obesity, diabetes

<p>Actually, Observer, you sound lazy. If you pressed Shift + y, you can 
capitalize your first word 'You'. And I'm still waiting for you to complete the 
sentence &quot; Not all are meant to be parents&quot;, as that is a sentence 
fragment missing a subject.</p> 
<p>Anyhow, I read that Getoveryourselves is a bit more realistic and 
functional than you may think. Parenting sometimes involves an active dialogue 
with what is best for your kid(s) at that moment. Being reactive doesn't mean 
you are lazy or a bad parent, but that you need to be flexible, and have the 
best intention in mind for the long run.</p> 
<p>I dare you go go to Disney for the day then go back to the hotel to cook an 
organic, homemade meal mid-day. There is some fun and functionality in eating 
what is available sometimes &ndash;and I'm sure your kids will survive.</p>

<p>Once in a while if you are feeling drive thru-ish then fine. Alot of us 
feel that way once in a while. It's the parents who seriously rationalize going 
to a drive thru every nigth because they are &quot;busy&quot;. These are the 
parents with fat kids who play video games and have a high risk for diabetes. 
Frozen vegetables are a better alternative to canned and actually cheaper! 
Organic is expensive and I totally agree about not buying all organic because 
of the cost. But goin to fast food can be more costly per month than cooking 
yourself. Alot of people seem to think healthy cooking has to be expensive but 
it's not. Parents need to spend time online looking up &quot;Quick 5 Item 
Meals&quot;. If parents are terrible cooks, that should light a fire under them 
to learn to cook better so they can teach their kids. Cooking dinner with 
little helpers is a great way to have fun.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 5:22 pm |

<p>The 'my mom used to do it, and I turned out ok' excuse is getting awfully 
tired. Let's face it; our parents also smoked and drank when they were pregnant 
with us, and let us ride without seatbelts in the front seat. That doesn't make 
those things safe or healthy in modern times. I certainly lay no blame on our 
parents' generation. We know more about healthy living and eating these days 
than they did a few decades ago. With education comes a responsibility to do 
better by our children. As a full time working mother, I take serious umbrage 
at the 'I'm too busy&quot; attitude that excuse-makers give. Yes, it takes away 
from my personal free time (NOT my time with my family, I am willing to make 
the 'me-time' sacrifice) to shop for healthy food and learn to cook it. Yes, I 
have to budget carefully to afford decent, fresh food. Yes, I very occasionally 
turn to convenience foods. And yes, sometimes I turn on the TV so that I can 
finish making dinner, but more often than not, I have little hands to help me 
prepare it. It can be done. It's not rocket science. It's hard work, and it's a 
choice.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 11:45 am | </li>

fine on spaghetti, Hamburger Helper, canned vegetables/fruits, frozen biscuits,

<p>Since when did women like you learn how to step out of the kitchen and use 
a computer? Sorry to break it to you Miss Sally Homemaker, but most households 
have adults that do have jobs that not only contribute to their family's 
well-being but also to the economy, instead of producing children with no 
exposure to normal childhood social circumstances before the age of 18. My wife 
and I both work to provide for our son and I still make him fresh meals at 
least twice a day (3 times on days that he isn't in daycare). Your kids may be 
eating fresh meals slightly more often, but at least I can sleep well in 
knowing that my kid is going to know how to act in society from an early age 
and probably less likely to off himself once he realizes that the world isn't 
just like the perfect little cocoon that you have falsely created for them.</p>

<p>or more likely protected their children from bullies like you...kudos to 
anyone who prioritizes their child's education rather than pushing them out the 
door to fight for a teacher's attention with 30+ other kids. Socialization is 
EVERYWHERE you don't have to get it in a public school.</p>  November 30, 2011

<p>Ummm, how is &quot;I can't cook because then I won't have time to talk to 
my kids&quot; a valid reason?</p> 
<p>My step-dad was a jerk about 70% of the time, but I still have fond 
memories of standing on a chair every afternoon to help with making salads from 
the age of 5 or 6, and we had plenty of time to chat. I even learned how to 
cook fresh easy food in the process!</p>  November 29, 2011 at 10:55 am |

<p>involve the kids where you can and you'll have time to talk. make it a

<li> <strong>Kim</strong> <br>

<p>My mom is a crappy cook, and didn't really teach me anything either. So as 
an adult I rarely made real food at home. In my late 20's I gradually gained 
weight and decided that enough was enough, I was going to start eating better. 
I started out with simple, 5 ingredient recipes. Through trial and error I can 
cook decent meals. However, if I hadn't practiced in the kitchen I would not be 
as proficient as I am now. Cooking takes practice, and if the author would look 
at it that way instead of seeing it as a &quot;chore&quot;, she could learn how 
to be more efficient in the kitchen. No one is asking OP to be a professional 
chef, just learn to throw together some quick, healthy meals that don't come 
from the freezer.</p> 
<p>Also, why could she not share the time prepping meals with her kids and 
&quot;catch up&quot; on their day then? Her kids would learn to cook AND have 
memorable bonding experiences with their mom. Stop whining and do what's right 
for yourself and your kids, instead of what is EASY and FAMILIAR.</p>  November

<p>I totally agree with the practice part, Kim. When I first got married (11 
years ago). I hated to cook. I did a lot of 'convenience food' meals (i.e., put 
convenience foods like jarred sauce together to make something). Gradually, I 
started to like cooking more and more and made it a goal to learn new 
techniques. What a fun challenge! I did more research and we started to eat 
healthier - whole foods (even though neither my husband nor I have a weight 
problem, cutting back on sodium and the like is good for anyone!). Now I 
subscribe to cooking magazines and usually try to try one new recipe a week and 
I get excited about new kitchen stuff and I find cooking to be a blast!</p>

<li> <strong>KIm</strong> <br>

<p>Most excellent! Plus, there's the added benefit of cooking new 
meals&ndash;you build up an arsenal of spices and seasonings! After a month of 
cooking your own dinners from scratch, you'll have lots of spices on hand to be 
able to &quot;throw together&quot; something on the fly.</p> 
<p>Cooking meat was my biggest challenge. I've gotten great at cooking burgers 
on the grill, sauteing or baking chicken (boneless or whole), searing steaks, 
etc. Thanks to a digital meat thermometer and reading lots of cooking blogs, 
lol!</p>  November 29, 2011 at 8:22 pm | </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>All you food Nazis need to chill out. Sometimes parents just don't have the 
time or don't have the skills to whip up a homemade meal. Serving pre-prepared 
food isn't that bad as long as it's balanced with something fresh, like a salad 
or fruit for dessert. I'd prefer kids eat that way than eating a fast food meal.

<p>My parents either don't know how to cook, or don't have the time... So they 
always give me this stuff. Frozen chicken fingers, pre-prepared meatloaf, 
frozen vegetables that are soggy and gross when served... It's not healthy, 
even the vegetables. The food is full of nitrates and sodium; I've read the 
labels. There's no such thing as frozen or pre-prepared foods that are 
genuinely as healthy as fresh food. I'm 17 and really don't want to grow up on 
this garbage.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 9:29 am |

<li> <strong>Another mom</strong> <br>

<p>If you are 17 years old you should be helping prepare the healthy meals. 
Why not make a list of healthy foods you would like to prepare and go to the 
store with your parents and select the ingredients and then help with the 
preparation. This would take care of two issues: 1) you have the healthy meals 
you should have and 2) you learn to plan and cook and when you are on your own 
or have a family it will be second nature.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 10:09 am |

<p>You are plenty old enough to cook. Watch some youtbe videos, take a class, 
get some cookbooks out of the library. Also, frozen vegetables are quite 
healthy. They are not technically as healthy as vegetables fresh out of a 
garden but they are often equally as healthy as vegetables from the grocer. If 
they are soggy, they're being prepared poorly.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 10:24

<p>He's only going to learn how to cook for himself if he has no other options 
or grows up. Speaking of not growing up, I know someone who is over 50 and 
claims he'd live on delivery pizza if his wife didn't cook for him. He is dead 
serious! He has no physical limitations to keep him from the learning basic 
cooking skills. He's just lazy and pathetic ... and yes, she enables him.</p>

<p>I think i's great that you are recognizing that there is unhealthy food out 
there. :) Even in this day and age there are 17 year olds who do not &quot;get 
it&quot;. I like part of a reposne above. Go grocery shopping with your 
parents. Pick up a &quot;quick and easy&quot; cookbook. When I was 17 I cooked 
all my dinners, and I Loved it! Especially when I started using new ingreients 
and herbs i learned abotu in teh cookbooks. :)</p>  November 29, 2011 at 5:43

<p>It's too bad cuz I was fortunate enough to enjoy several semesters of Home

<p>Eating for the Americans is a way to fill your stomachs. It is not an art 
or a way of life. Fast food, fast buck is the norm. No wonder why so many 
Americans are obese. They eat food filled with sodium who holds the water in 
your body. I worked all my life, and there was always a home make cooked meal. 
Do not tell about the time, it is just a matter of time management.</p>

<p>Serving pre-prepared &quot;food&quot; to a child, certainly DOES mean you 
are a poor parent. Borderline criminal actually.<br>
 The problem with you 
American women is that you do not learn refinement like Europeans do. Hence, 
your American obesity epidemic.</p>

<p>I don't disagree that many Americans are obese! But there are a few of us 
who work full time, and cook healthy well rounded meals every night of the 
week. I love to grocery shop and my 6 yr old picks things out with me and helps 
choose the menu so he can learn how to cook and what healthy choices look like.

<p>Obesity is not confined to Americans. And, as evidenced by your post, 
neither is rudeness.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 11:47 am | </li>

<p>Talk about manners. . .so should we American women take our cue from you 
and stereotype all European women as judgmental and ethnocentric based on just 
your repsonse?</p> 
<p>Balance seems like a good concept here &ndash; balance time with your kids, 
healthy food and timesavers. No one is perfect, but we do what we can to make 
sure our kids get the nutrition they need. We don't love our kids less if we 
don't chop the carrots by hand.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 1:24 pm | </li>

<p>I agree with needing to feed healthy options to kids but DO NOT AGREE WITH 
YOUR ATTITUDE! You European women need to learn how to act like respectful 
individuals and not walk around with a European stick up your ass. Get off your 
high horse and please keep your &quot;European&quot; thoughts to yourself.

<p>I'm with you &ndash; to a point. Using the supermarket as your sous chef 
for minimally processed foods: good. Indulging in premade food every so often, 
whether it be McDonald's or in the freezer case: fine. Justifying a steady diet 
of ultraprocessed food: that's what it sounds like you're doing, and that's 
where you lose me.</p> 
<p>Part of the problem is Americans have come to believe that cooking is more 
difficult than it actually is. I have a five-ingredient microwave recipe for 
scratch macaroni and cheese (admittedly not health food, but w/more protein 
&amp; calcium than Easy Mac) that takes 10 minutes from fridge &amp; pantry to 
table. You can make unbelievable meals in the slow cooker with maybe 4 minutes 
of prep before work. Searing a steak or chop and opening a bag of salad takes 
less than 20 minutes. Admit it &ndash; roasting a chicken, while not rocket 
science, is pretty daunting for someone who needs dinner on the table five 
minutes ago. Easiest of all &ndash; don't cook! Buy veggies from the grocery 
store's salad bar and eat them raw!</p> 
<p>Yes, by all means, pick foods that are easier to prepare &ndash; but let's 
not confuse treats of takeout or TV dinners with the kinds of foods that should 
be the biggest part of our diet.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 9:06 am | 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Ann</strong> <br>

<p>Also, if you're intimidated by (or don't have time for) roasting a whole 
chicken, just get some chicken parts and bake them instead &ndash; you'll be 
done in less than half an hour. Plain with salt and pepper is fine. Add some 
herbs if you like. Even Shake&amp;Bake isn't so bad! It's better than getting 
spongy chicken &quot;nuggets&quot; shaped like dinosaurs.</p>  November 29, 
2011 at 12:40 pm | </li> 
<li> <strong>Michelle</strong> <br>

<p>Well put! I wish the author had considered these points when making her 
argument. As it is, it falls flat and sounds more like a rationalization than a 
good reason to feed your family poorly.</p>  November 29, 2011 at 2:29 pm |
