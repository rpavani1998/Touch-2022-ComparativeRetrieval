Subject: Re: Child with eczema
<p>My daughter Nadia has had AD since 18 mos. She's allergic to dust mites and 
of course cat and rabbit fur. We've been to most of the dermatologists in local 
practice, as well as a homeopathic clinic. I think the homeopathic stuff may 
have strengthened Nadia's immune system, because after the regimine was 
complete she almost never had staph infections. She still suffers almost 
constant itching, flaking, thin skin and naturally the scratches she inflicts 
on herself.</p>
<p>It would be great to have Lyncoln e-mail Nadia directly, so they can 
kid-talk about their experiences.&nbsp;</p> Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 00:39:04

<p>Richard: I am extremely allergic to nuts and seeds, and avoid or reduce 
intake of caffeine, sugar, salt, citrus, and dairy products to keep my 
condition under control. Water seems to be GOOD for me, on the other hand. 
Unfortunately, there seem to be more things that have a negative effect than 
there are things that have a positive effect.&nbsp;</p> Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996

<p>Gil, the molluscum info is fascinating. I was never told it was contagious. 
Shouldn't the doctors have mentioned that? And makes me wonder how I got it. I 
only get them on my face. Mostly on my eyelids, but I did have one on my cheek. 
How long is the incubation period? You say they're supposed to just curl up and 
die by themselves, but mine never did. I had my first two for nearly a year 
before removing them. The dermatologist said they were harmless and need only 
be removed for cosmetic reasons. I tried to live with them but eventually 
decided I couldn't stand looking at them anymore. I went to an eye doctor for 
the surgery since my dermatologist said he didn't feel comfortable working in 
the delicate area of the eye. The eye doctor is the one who told me it was a 
virus and if not removed could cause blindness. Since then I get them removed 
within 6 months, but they've never gone away by themselves.&nbsp;</p> Date:

<p>I tried drops under the tongue along with a diet that excluded all dairy, 
and anything with gluten! It nearly killed me--a whole year of the most boring 
foods imaginable. I got all the gluten-free cookbooks and made my own rice 
bread, etc. It was fine the first time eaten just out of the oven. After that, 
it was like eating plain grain; it would all crumble and fall apart in your 
hands. It was quite expensive eating that kind of diet. And I am an avid bread 
and ice cream fan! I lost a lot of weight. Finally, I just got tired of it. 
When I went back to milk, I could no longer tolerate it at all--milk now makes 
so miserable I can only tolerate minute amounts periodically. I used to like 
cereal, but that's impractical. I skip breakfast entirely now becuz there's 
just not much to bother with anymore. Most meat makes be gag if I have to fix 
my own, so I stick with veggie casseroles and vegburgers, things like that. Veg 
pizza is a big favorite--no grease. I feel like Ingrid Bergman, who when she 
was told she had lung cancer, kept right on smoking to the end! You only live 
once!&nbsp;</p> Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 16:52:20 -0600 From: Kristen Subject: Re: 
Massage and Telangiectasia
<p>Shelley, I suspect any one who has used cortisone religiously will end up 
with telangiectasia, but they may not if they do faithful derm follow ups. I 
know mine is the result of overuse of steroids that were much too strong for 
too long a period, like 10 yrs. All the male derm's I saw insisted I had acne; 
it was only a woman derm dr who knew immediately what was wrong with me! I 
chalk it up to arrogance and failure to listen on their part. Maybe ignorance, 
too.</p>
<p>That is a novel idea--it never occurred to me to consider a dry massage. Is 
it strictly hands on with nothing to lubricate? For how much time can you 
tolerate it?&nbsp;</p> Date: Thu, 1 Feb 1996 23:11:21 EST From: Gilbert 
Subject: Re: molluscum
<p>Hi, Shelley. Yes, with some folk the so-called &quot;benign&quot; molluscum 
can be problematic. Blepharitis (i.e., inflammation of the eyelids) and 
conjunctivitis can sometimes be associated with molluscum. I say 
&quot;associated&quot; because oftentimes there are several things at play 
here. For example, if a contact dermatitis arises due to, say, allergies caused 
by agents like eye drops or cosmetics, the irritation can provide a seeding bed 
for molluscum or, for that matter, for any pathogenic contaminant. And, though 
we usually don't realize it, our hands are all over our faces. Hands (esp. 
fingers) can carry bacteria and viruses better than any inanimate fomite I know 
of. Of course, I'm not saying that hands are the culprit, but whenever I think 
of routes by which skin infections get launched, I always think: hands. So, I 
would wonder about contact allergies. At least, I would not want to forget them.
</p>
<p>More to the point, molluscum with its little elevated lid-margin tumors has 
a &quot;tendency&quot; with some people to &quot;set up house.&quot; When so, 
it's probably because there (is/was) a follicular conjunctivitis that's claimed 
squatter's rights and become chronic -- and sometimes secretively so. If this 
is the case, it seems to be due to the toxic effect of viral particles (i.e., 
incomplete virions) that have gotten shed. Then there's something of a vicious 
cycle with &quot;reoccurrences&quot; of the &quot;same.&quot; And, sure enough, 
when these forces are at play, the bug doesn't just whither away.</p>
<p>Like you, I don't know why physicians tend to be poor communicators. I 
think your dermatologist, however, communicated well in referring you on to an 
eye specialist. Any phenomenon around the eye is &quot;hands off&quot; for 
nonspecialists to my way of thinking. I'm sorry you've had repeated bouts with 
our (usually) &quot;benign&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot; virus. And, even here, 
the degree of the problem is, as we see, quite dependant on the individual who 
presents with the problem. Just because molluscum is not the &quot;big&quot; 
issue of herpes viruses popping up in the periorbital region, does not for a 
moment say that it cannot or must not be a problem. Perhaps a number of medical 
people don't really appreciate that; maybe they're accustomed to needing a 
staph explosion or a herpetic crisis to warrant &quot;medical advice.&quot; 
Communication is a critical event in the history of successful treatments.</p>
<p>Actually, the sort of issue you've brought up here, is one of the things 
that interests me about the topic of eczema. I'm concerned with infection. 
Eczema itself is not an infection. Eczema, however, in the context of its 
effect, can be a cause for infection insofar as its lesions can lead to a 
violation of skin integrity, whether that violation is primary or secondary. At 
that point, we have an issue that needs to be and, probably, can be addressed. 
Hence, doctors, nurses, the role of the fields of medicine. Hence, 
communication. This forum, too, is a module for communication and brings its 
own eye witnesses.</p> Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 07:55:20 -0500 From: Ralph

<p>I abstained from meat for about 4 years in my mid-twenties. I think I was

Feb 1996 04:06:11 CST From: Kristen Subject: Re: molluscum
<p>Gil, Your reply to Shelley's query is intriguing to me, especially your 
comments about the hands and contact allergens. Would these two factors account 
in large measure to the problem of perpetually itchy eyelids? Even when I take 
great pains to keep my hands off, the eyelids still itch and I end up itching 
and rubbing them in my sleep. This is after I've showered and washed my face 
well with Cetaphil and even the eye soaps before going to bed. When I've had 
longer &quot;hands off&quot; periods, my eyes feel better and the side effects 
of weeping eyes and blurry vision recede as well. So I know I am creating a lot 
of my own eye problems. But it's nearly impossible not to rub the eyes when the 
cursed itch lingers.&nbsp;</p> Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 04:34:33 CST From: Kristen 
Subject: Re: What about food?
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow, a year. I'm impressed. But did it help your eczema? &lt;&lt; 
</p>
<p>That's really a good question. At the time, I was so busy working two jobs 
and because I think I have a tendency to repress past eczema miseries, I don't 
remember specifics about the eczema. My impression after a year was that it 
wasn't very significant or I think I would have thought it was worthwhile to 
stick with it. I just felt so deprived and irritated, I decided &quot;the h--- 
with it.&quot;</p>
<p>I would actually like to lose weight. That episode was 20 years ago, and 
most of the weight stayed off for about 20 years. The one thing I do recall, on 
retroflecting, is that when I have been so busy that my mind is totally 
occupied with many other things, when I literally have no time for the eczema, 
it ceased to dominate my life. Guess that's why I believe the psyche is a great 
part of the eczema puzzle.</p>
<p>Yes, supposedly breakfast is of prime importance. But if you can't have 
milk on cereal, no wheat products (no toast, no pancakes, no bran, no oatmeal), 
no anything that contains gluten (and most flour items have gluten), I got 
bored silly on a total fruit and vegetable diet.</p>
<p>I do eat meat occasionally; about twice a year I order filet. And I 
microwave bacon occasionally. If I have chicken, it's usually in small amounts. 
Generally it doesn't appeal to me. Never eat sandwich or processed meat, or 
sausages. Something about the texture repels me on the tongue!</p>
<p>Feeling like Ingrid Bergman can't be ALL bad, I guess. I think the thing 
about eczema that irritates me is that it deprives one of so many 
things--activities, foods, risks one dare not take or pay the consequences. 
Years ago when I went camping, knowing I would be miserable by the end of it, 
recovery was long and excruciating. I was much more self-conscious about it 
then, and it was my personal, very dark secret that had to be kept hidden at 
all costs. It was a huge constraint; I felt like I was living my life in a 
strait jacket.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate your reply, Ralph. Don't think I've ever 
&quot;said&quot; how I really felt about this problem before. It's something of 
a relief! When I was growing up, most things were off-limits for discussion, 
least of all my particular problem.</p> Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 09:45:47 ... 
From: Richard Subject: Thin Skin
<p>I've been told about &quot;thin skin&quot; and topical steroid use since I 
started the AD ride 30 years ago. Well, I was in the Doc's and I looked at my 
arms in the neon light. They have a bluish cast which looks like light bruises. 
The doc said &quot;thin skin&quot; and it's reversible. I have to tell you that 
I got really scared. So my question is, has anyone dealt with this? Does it 
clear up? Is it topical or systemic or both? How long does it take to clear up? 
What happens when one has thin skin? Is the meat on my arms going to fall 
out?&nbsp;</p> Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 13:57:47 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: 
Massage
<p>Kris, I get an hour massage, and could actually take more. I first got into 
getting massage as a child when a doctor &quot;prescribed&quot; it. I had to 
get a massage every day that my skin could handle it and I've been hooked ever 
since. It's a very interesting psychological experience to get massage. It's 
much easier for me to receive the touch by a professional giving me a massage, 
than it is for me to be touched by a loved one, though I have been doing much 
better with that lately. When I get a professional massage, I surrender to the 
treatment like I do when going to all doctors. I just go limp and let them do 
what they're supposed to do to me. And it feels so good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I get a massage, I think about how scratching is a twisted 
attempt to get this touch that I crave and how I am insatiable for this 
feeling. Yet with loved ones, I usually feel uncomfortable getting touched 
much, for a variety of reasons, mostly to do with it getting tangled up with my 
emotional response to the touch. It triggers old fears and grief and anger and 
it's not entirely pleasant the way it is with a professional who is just doing 
a job and emotions have nothing to do with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually emotions DO get triggered when I get a professional massage but I 
enjoy that because I can just lay there and think about them intellectually and 
objectively. I don't have to interact and explain my complicated feelings to 
the other person, I can just examine them privately and it's interesting to 
experience it. When you have this condition your entire life, it effects you 
more profoundly than you can ever explain to anyone. It's as if all my frenzied 
scratching is not an attempt to get at parasites under the skin but to somehow 
touch and comfort my aching soul that has endured so much agony. When I get a 
massage, tears often come to my eyes. For me, it is the only pure pleasure of 
the skin and I have it in my will that if possible, I want a massage to be my 
last experience before I die...</p> Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 07:35:35 -0600 
Subject: Re: Thin Skin
<p>Hi Richard, I couldn't help laughing at your last comment! Wayne and I have 
a half-century of living with eczema. I don't know if he has used steroids as 
much as I have, but somehow the thin skin seems to perpetuate itself as more 
thin skin. It hasn't &quot;reversed&quot; itself in my experience. The skin in 
the bends of my arms is so thin that I have very prominent veins that protrude 
and are easily seen. No digging to find a vein when I have blood drawn! When I 
was at boot camp for ARNG 20 yrs ago,, some of my sister privates reported me 
to the commander, and I was asked about drug use! I was very amused--I had enuf 
problems without using needles. What was more amazing to me is that anyone 
noticed it; I never examined other people's arms just in passing!</p>
<p>But with cortisone use, if I bump or pinch myself anywhere from the waist 
up, I get huge blood blisters that take a long time to recede. I conclude that 
the blood is very near the surface, and I bleed easily. Altho I also clot 
rapidly, so it's nothing to worry about, I guess. Thin skin for me has meant 
extreme sensitivity to hot humid weather or cold--just about everything that 
most people don't even think about. Limiting oneself has become a way of life 
for me; kinda second nature now.</p> Date: Fri, 2 Feb 1996 14:34:48 EST From: 
Wayne Subject: This &amp; That
<p>All this talk about food made me hungry, so I eat carry-out (Moo Goo Gai 
Pan !) as I do this. You see, I am not allergic to any- thing except certain 
peppers in Mexican food. When I hit one, however small piece of the pepper, I 
break out into a raging sweat. (We have not talked about AD and sweat glans 
yet). I am lucky I have chronic AD that is widespread and dry/ with only oozing 
flare-upsand different levels of itch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On itch, I notice3 kinds. Type one is the kind of itch that one or two 
scratches takes it away for good. Type two, I'll call Shelley's Orgasmic itch, 
which invites more itch until skin is torn up. Type three is an area itch in 
that you can't point to the exact spot that invites scratch. Behaviorally I 
have to keep from the temptation of Recreational Scrathing. Shelley, your idea 
of looking at the scratch really makes sense, and works for me sometimes. There 
is something about the raging Orgasmic scratch where I almost automatically 
turn away from the sight of the damage. I'm lucky so far, in that I don'g have 
problems with molluscum, itchy eyes, palm blisters, etc.&nbsp;</p>

Sun, 4 Feb 1996 12:51:59 -0500 From: Shelley Subject: Re: Thin Skin
<p>Richard, I'm nearly 39 and also used to fear the unknown effects of thin 
skin. The doctors really scared me with all their warnings. Now thin skin is 
just something I live with like all the other limitations of this condition. 
The main effect as I age is that my skin tears so much more easily than it did 
when I was younger. I remember I used to be able to scratch really hard and the 
damage was a certain amount, but now I will get the same amount of damage just 
from scratching lightly (what I consider lightly). So I have to be more 
careful. And I think it tends to get infected more easily because it tears more 
easily. It's interesting that Kris mentioned the bruising effects. I get that 
too but I had assumed it was because I inherited my mother's chronic leukemia. 
Hearing Kris, I think it's more likely that my bruising is connected to my thin 
skin...</p> Date: Sun, 4 Feb 1996 15:02:28 EST From: Wayne Subject: Skin after 
50 years
<p>Hi eczema community: This thin skin conversation is making me think about 
that issue because I don't think I have thin skin now. My skin was thin before 
the period in 1979/80 when I was hospitalized for AD for one week. Before that 
time I had been taking pregnisone (not sure about the spelling) to fight back a 
major flare-up. I was red all over, oozing, and shivering in the summer heat 
(because I did not have much of an outer layer of skin to insulate, so I was 
losing heat in the summer!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I have not taken pregnisone since. I have never used a lot of 
topical steroids. Probably I use two to three tubes of Lidex and Triamsinolone 
(sp) a year.Even during my July 95 flare-up I did not use much steroids. I used 
a bunch of stuff like bag balm and mom steroidal ointments and creams along 
with bandaging, rubber bands for area itch, and some bathing. I am thinking 
that is maybe the reason that it take me about 2 months to work out of a 
flare-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may sound like a contradiction, but if I have a serious flare-up skin 
is thin. My usual is not thin. Anyway, skin is not thin, at least for now. Skin 
is the dry type and is leathery at the joints, (lucky me), rather than thin.My 
hands have always looked wrinkled, like someone 50 and over. Finally now that I 
am 50, my hands have reached my age. Wayne 8.4/10</p> Date: Sun, 4 Feb 1996 
22:21:24 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: Thin Skin
<p>Hi, Shelly, Kris, and all. </p>
<p>Since several of you have mentioned problems with &quot;thin skin&quot; and 
are making the association between it and eczema, I'd like to put in here that 
one of the many problems associated with long-term use of cortisones 
(hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, etc.) is not only thinning skin but 
also a breakdown in collagen as well as alteration in the behavior of our blood 
platelets (thrombocytes). The bruising (ecchymoses) makes me wonder again about 
steroid use over extended time. Also, because cortisones cause a degradation of 
collagen, the thin skin needs to be thought of as possibly part of the same 
picture presented by others in the forum who've commented on general breakdown 
of integument, including the venous blood-rich dermal layer under the surface 
skin (epidermis) as well as some muscle breakdown (atrophy). It's collagen 
which cements all these components into a three-dimensional functional 
structure. Loss of collagen is another part of the &quot;thinning&quot; 
process: three-dimension: two-dimension -- you get the idea.</p>
<p>I am not claiming that all incidents of these symptoms are cortisone 
related. I am merely reminding of the fact that these are &quot;expected&quot; 
outcomes of long-term cortisone &quot;therapy.&quot;</p>
<p>PS: Is it possible that the high frequency of complaints re: 
telangiectasias (spider-web-thin enlargements with or without hemorrhages in 
the tiny veins (venules) of the dermal skin layer of the face might just 
possibly be &quot;more&quot; a result of cortisone use (over time!) than of any 
direct or even indirect effects of &quot;eczema?&quot; After all, eczema is 
itself not the only culprit in this &quot;can of worms.&quot; We all know the 
old saw about which is worse, the disease or its treatments. . .</p>
<p>PS #2: The bruising phenomenon should not be confused with the issue of 
coagulation in the context of clotting time. These have more to do with 
separate &quot;clotting factors&quot; in the blood. The platelets -- they get 
fragile (outright friable!) -- affected by cortisones present to the eye the 
appearance of either tiny red specks under the skin (petechiae, i.e., tiny 
single hemorrhaged venules) or as telangiectasias (that is, they hemorrhage or 
enlarge [engorge] in line with the direction of the venule) or, finally, as 
larger surface bruised areas (ecchymoses).</p>
<p>The combination of thinned skin, compromised dermis and diminished muscle 
mass secondary to collagen loss, as well as steroid-dependant determinants 
which discourage new tissue growth and healing add up and account for some of 
the problems getting aired on the forum.</p> Date: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 13:29:19

Kristen Subject: Re: Thin Skin
<p>Gil, Thanks for that extensive explanation about thin skin. I never 
attributed that to the eczema--I knew it was the cortisone use. I think the 
thinned out skin on my face is what makes my face so susceptible to infection 
and any &quot;foreign&quot; substance I inadvertently expose it to. But I'm 
more interested in the idea of the platelets become friable!! That scares me a 
lot. I know what it means for the skin to be friable; it's the necrotic skin of 
death even while one is alive. Are you talking about the platelets of both the 
RBCs and the WBCs? If the platelets crumble within the blood cells, does that 
bode ill for specific diseases like leukemia or something?</p>
<p>And with destruction of the collagen and subsequent diminished muscle mass, 
over time can one expect to lose ambulatory status or use of limbs?</p> Date:

<p>Shelley, Nadia has also spoken about death, like &quot;why don't I just put 
an end to my misery and kill myself?&quot;. Naturally, Tamara and I are most 
worried when we hear that kind of talk, given so much nihilistic thinking 
amongst teenagers these days. (Nadia IS only 10, mind you.)</p>
<p>I think we've been fairly successful in dealing with this hopelessness; we 
haven't heard death wishes in a while. However, Nadia still generally ignores 
her bone dry or leathery skin as a way of avoiding the acceptance of her state. 
And, given that she has had very few infections and has not ripped herself up 
badly, we prefer a more peaceful home over the constant nagging that would be 
needed to get her to pay more attention to moisturizing.</p> Date: Mon, 5 Feb 
1996 22:35:57 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Steroids vs. Collagen
<p>When I use topical steriods a lot, my skin seems to become quite friable. 
When things are like that, I will sometimes lose a little tiny chunk of skin if 
I accidentally scrape my hand against something hard.</p>
<p>That certainly fits in with the collagen connection. Without collagen I 
think our bodies would be no more cohesive than a raw steak. We would literally 
fall apart, except for the bones, of course, and they probably are made of 
collagen too (I'm guessing) before they mineralize.</p>
<p>That's why I try to avoid steriods except when I see no practical 
alternative. At this point I use Diprolene only about 4 or 5 days a month, at a 
guess.</p> Date: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 22:46:22 -0500 From: Ralph Subject: Dire 
Consequences? I don't think so.
<p>Kristen, I'm not answering for Gil, who obviously knows much more about 
this than I do, but I think platelets are a separate type of blood cell, not 
inside RBCs or WBCs. Correct me if I'm wrong, someone.</p>
<p>And I very much doubt that leukemia or anything similar is a consequence of 
our problems or our use of steriods. Things may be bad, but not THAT bad!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And with destruction of the collagen and subsequent diminished 
muscle mass, over time can one expect to lose ambulatory status or use of 
limbs? &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Again, I would personally be very surprised if that were true. Not that I'm 
an expert, but I never heard of any such result. I think we're just doomed to 
keep on itching and scratching and sometimes to feel quite miserable, but not 
to become disabled or life-threateningly ill.</p> Date: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 
22:46:32 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: Thin Skin
<p>Hi, Kristen. Increased susceptibility to infection is even more related to 
decreased immune function if we're still talking in the context of cortisone 
therapies. All the same, a thinner skin will be weaker and more susceptible to 
abrasions, tares and shearing-force types of injury.</p>
<p>I need to be clearer about the contextual damage to platelets 
(thrombocytes). I rather regret using the term &quot;friable&quot; -- the 
problem that overuse of steroids (glucocorticosteroids such as the cortisones) 
entrains has nothing to do with necrotizing skin, so that fear seems 
unwarranted. Also, while trying to be clear on this point, I'll mention that 
there is no such entity as &quot;platelets of both the RBCs and the WBCs.&quot; 
Platelets are a discrete species of corpuscles, not quite cells, in fact. They 
serve several known functions, one of which is to plug up torn or severed blood 
vessels. Cortisones cause a decrease in number and efficiency of circulating 
platelets. Having fewer platelets (thrombocytopenia) means that broken blood 
vessels don't get patched and closed as effectively as they ought to. Minor 
hemorrhages such as I mentioned in my letter yesterday will result. Platelets 
also play various roles in signaling immune cells to &quot;come to task.&quot; 
So, diminished numbers of platelets add to a reduced immune surveillance.</p>
<p>Also, there is no association here with immune cell diseases such as the 
leukemias. The frequent low platelet count found with those diseases is due to 
other pathological causes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And with destruction of the collagen and subsequent diminished 
muscle mass, pver time can one expect to lose ambulatory status or use of 
limbs? &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>No. The most &quot;extreme&quot; I could imagine would be an expected sort 
of scenario where someone has such a reduced immunocompetence that 
&quot;if&quot; s(he) incurs an injury to the integument, it might not heal. If 
an immortal wound is allowed to get worse, to get infected, etc., then the 
condition could, of course, result in gross damage. If the damage is so 
extensive and threatens to keep extending in size, depth, etc., then &quot;lose 
of . . .&quot; might be a real occasion. But then, here, we're talking about 
unbridled infection. For all that, I can't help but remind that 
&quot;unbridled&quot; suggests that the wound was not or could not be 
contained. Containment is the primary function of the &quot;unpleasant&quot; 
phenomenon we call &quot;inflammation.&quot; Inflammation seeks to &quot;wall 
off&quot; injured areas so they do not spread. Then, in confinement, the 
injured area can be dealt with discretely by our protective mechanisms (i.e., 
the immune system, etc.).</p> Date: Tue, 6 Feb 1996 13:37:27 -0500 From:

<p>Gil, I really appreciate your insights and ability to tie together all the 
symptoms and come up with the common cause. I agree that the long-term use of 
steroids and cortisone is the culprit, not the eczema. If people can manage to 
live without those drugs, they should do it. When you're a child, your parents 
make these decisions for you, and you have no choice in the matter. As with all 
drugs, if you're going to take them, you should be an adult who can give 
informed consent, willing to take the risk of the side effects. As for myself, 
I have no regrets. I've been in such agony so many times that without that 
medication I would have either committed suicide or gone berserk and landed in 
a mental institution. The point is that it must be used as a last resort. 
People should try everything else first, like Wren is doing, but when you're 
desperate, it's worth it. Of course, I'm only 39. Ask me again in 20 or 30

<p>Wayne, how do you use rubber bands to control itching? I am learning so 
much already. I had never heard or used the word &quot;friable&quot; before I 
got online!</p>
<p>Ladies, I have the idea that we eczema women use steroids more readily that 
the men. I confess to often using the stuff for cosmetic reasons. Whereas the 
men I've encountered with skin problems like mine seem to only use drugs for 
itch control. I wonder if anyone has done a study on this. Now that I am close 
to 50, I do anything I can to avoid a red face, because someone always seems to 
point at me and shout &quot;HOT FLASH!&quot; (half joking)</p>
<p>I have learned to not apply cortisone right after a scratching frenzy. If I 
wait a few hours (maybe overnight), it's easier to zero in on the really bad 
area and I can avoid zapping areas that were only temporarily red from the 
scratching. Also, I like to use Eucerin cream as a moisturizer because its 
white color tones down the red. Whereas, the vaseline seemed to highlight it. 
The psychological boost I get is worth the 5 fold price difference, I guess.</p>
<p>I also have sinus trouble. When my sinuses get bad, the skin gets better 
and visa versa. When I have a fever, my skin clears completely. Does anyone 
else experience this? My allergist thinks this is unusual.</p>
<p>My current passion is to get Elocon and other potent skin meds in a stick 
form. It would be much easier to apply sparingly without zapping the fingers 
each time. If anyone is out there from the drug companies, please push this 
idea through your R&amp;D dept. fast!</p> Date: Tue, 6 Feb 1996 22:34:12 -0500

From: Gilbert Subject: Dire Consequences? I don
<p>Just a couple more comments re: platelets and the issue raised regarding 
possible loss of mobility:</p>
<p>I gave the &quot;no&quot; answer to the issue of loss of mobility because 
the context was &quot;over time.&quot; In other words, even long-term steroid 
use with all its decrements does not cause ambulatory loss. OK, every global 
statement probably has its exceptions. Here, there is one exception. Acute 
muscle weakness (myopathy) can result from massive acute systemic cortisone 
administration. I did not mention it before because it simply doesn't apply to 
our situation with eczema in this forum. So, there is an exception to the rule, 
but it would take a context such as massive chemotherapy (that's an example) to 
bring on such a myopathy. Even then, it is reversible with cessation of steroid 
treatment, though it usually takes a couple months to reverse out the myopathy. 
I'm mentioning this only to be complete. This scenario does not apply to eczema 
or other atopias.</p>
<p>And, finally, just a note to clarify the query about what platelets are and 
aren't. Technically, platelets are not cells. Since they are not, we don't call 
them cells but give them the name, corpuscles. And here's why and what the 
distinction's about:</p>
<p>White blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (i.e., all the 
constituents of what we normally think of as blood &quot;cells&quot;) derive 
from a common ancestor stem cell in the bone marrow. This marrow stem cell is 
acted on by physiological determinants (ex. micro-hormones, enzymes, etc..) 
which shape its destiny. If we use the analogy of a tree whose trunk is the 
stem cell, then we can trace the course of development which it will take. Some 
stem cells are acted on so that they become red blood cells, others are acted 
on differently and become white blood cells. Think of these as large branches 
stemming off the stem-cell trunk. This process of development is called 
differentiation. The particular destiny of the cell in question is termed it's 
&quot;path of commitment.&quot;</p>
<p>Just one step further and we can appreciate that even these branches will 
further differentiate and commit themselves (i.e., be committed) to even more 
specialization through differentiation. Therefore, some white blood cells are 
&quot;lymphocytes,&quot; others are &quot;neutrophils.&quot; And, this story 
goes on and on. Following this same analogy, the diversity is just as rich and 
rewarding in the branches of RBCs. For example, the RBCs which produce IgE are 
one generation from their &quot;parent&quot; generic RBC.</p>
<p>And, finally, there are platelets: These entities are servants in 
attendance to more complex blood cells such as RBCs and WBCs. Platelets don't 
need to possess &quot;intelligence.&quot; Therefore, they derive from the 
common stem cell by extruding their nucleus along with other organelles 
associated with complex interactive decision=making obligations. Because these 
erstwhile &quot;cells&quot; have extruded a number of intracellular regulatory 
components, they no longer possess the &quot;relative&quot; independence we 
necessarily associate with what we call a cell.</p>
<p>Well then, what are corpuscles (i.e., platelets)? They are globs of 
cohesive, interactive enzymes which can be &quot;called to task&quot; by WBCs. 
A WBC will, for instance, issue an instruction -- and notice that this requires 
&quot;intelligence,&quot; hence a nucleus with DNA and RNA which enable it to 
live and multiply, to repair itself and to manufacture environmentally 
significant products -- and the &quot;dumb&quot; platelet will be the 
chemically active glob which will &quot;respond&quot; by turning over its 
chemical reactions into product of one description or another. It should come 
as no surprise that platelets don't last very long -- they don't have the 
where-with-all to reproduce. They serve and desist.</p>
<p>The topic is complex but interesting. I don't think it's germane to our 
forum interests, however.</p>
<p>My purpose, therefore, is merely to &quot;try&quot; to clarify some 
physiology so that there aren't misunderstandings. Sorry for playing professor.

like you're doing and they wished they could die sometimes too. Remember that

were times when she just couldn't take it anymore. Many nights when she cried 
and screamed and tossed and turned for hours and hours all night long. And days

told herself that she wanted to be tough enough and strong enough to keep 
living till her skin got better. And she did! And so did lots of other people.

reversible -- at least in the reasonable context of our discussion. So, 
immunological questions could arise such as &quot;do wounds heal as they ought

<p>My respiratory problems are much better with allergy shots. I also use 
various antihistamines, and , of course, nasal steroids. When I'm not 
slathering it on my skin, I'm snuffing it up my nostrils; I am a true steroid

National Jewish has great derm and allergy depts. They will take you and 
completely analyze your immune system. I think it takes about a week.</p>
<p>Yes the wet wrapping can be an extremely time consuming, life altering 
activity. When I did it every night all over, it was the only way I could 
sleep. The wet cloth felt so much better than dry cloth or than skin ( like 
where my legs would rub together). It also made the skin more resilient, less 
powdery, less friable. Alas, the rash and inflamation were still there.</p>
<p>Elocon is a potent steroid type ointment. I think it would work in stick 
form in the same way that a chapstick can be vaseline based. It would still go 
on greasy, it would just be easier to spread real thinly. I don't use any cream 
forms of meds. The greasier the better as far as I am concerned; my derm doctor 
agrees with me on this.</p>
<p>Allergy shots have been my salvation. I guess it could be placebo effect or 
just coincidence? It took over a year before I really started improving; and at 
first I went downhill with some really bad flares. I'm still pretty much 
covered, but the rash is so much less dramatic. Now a flare is pink; it used to 
be deep, deep oozing burgundy. Sinuses are better too. The shots only are 
appropriate for people who test positive to pollen and dust allergies. Finding 
enough intact skin to test is a challenge for eczema patients. My hives were 
mostly 6s and 7s on a scale of 0 to 4, so I looked like a good candidate.</p>

<p>Ann: I use the thick rubber bands (like the post office uses to bundle junk 
mail delivered) to put over limbs which have just been scratched in response to 
orgasmic itch. I find that with orgasmic itch I will scratch until things are 
pretty well torn up if I don't be careful. Watching the damage I'm doing helps 
(idea from Shelley), so I stop scratching and put these rubber bands over 
affected limbs, over some nice cotton pants or shirt. This helps hold back the 
invitation to scratch on. I think what happens is that the pressure of the 
rubber bands pushes back some of the blood/fluids that heat up the itch. Also, 
the rubber bands cause sharp pressure which substitutes for the destructive 
action of scraping nails. You won't find this method in the Merck manual.&nbsp;

Re: REPLY TO RALPH immune issues
<p>Ann, I'm not sure how you differentiate between one and the other. 
Cortisone use has made me more susceptible to sunlight, heat, humidity and 
sweating that I tolerated fairly well when I was younger and had never used it. 
So I now have acutely sensitive skin. I'm not sure how one can tell if it's an 
immune-based problem or just sensitive skin?</p>
<p>It's true having broken skin makes one more susceptible; I was refused 
admission to nursing school at 19 because of it. They said I'd never make it 
through surgery--hands were a mess. Guess it was an impractical ambition--in 
retrospect. At the time I felt utterly destroyed. I know the paper company at 
home wouldn't consider hiring me because of the eczema. They produced Kotex, 
Kleenex, etc., in a sterile environment, and I was a risk--probably both ways! 
I think you are correct about exposing yourself to any virus--true for all of 
us, no doubt. Altho I've read that saliva and the skin do not pass the virus 
on. It has to be blood or other internal body fluids. Broken skin would make 
you a bad recipient for sure, though. For me, the eczema has become an excuse 
to withdraw physically from people.&nbsp;</p> Date: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 17:36:03

<p>Hi, Ann. Forget whether a fear is &quot;politically&quot; correct or not 
&lt;g&gt;. You correctly use the word &quot;phobia&quot; to identify an 
irrational fear. As a health officer in the field of infectious disease I 
engage in both clinical and research areas of immuno(in)competence and, 
especially, AIDS. Professionally (and therefore personally), I do not worry 
about possible contact contamination such as a handshake, a kiss -- casual 
social gestures -- in the context of the HIV virus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot say the same when it comes to Staph infections 
(there are too many to list here) and a number of other *bacterial* agents 
which can present problems to folks with open skin lesions. If I had a penny 
for everyone who's had to pay dearly for infections gotten from casual-contact 
*bacterial* contamination, I'd be wealthy. If I had a fortune for demonstrating 
a case of casual-contact infection from AIDS, I'd remain penniless for it.</p>
<p>For what it's worth saliva is antimicrobial to HIV. An open skin contact 
would need to be a compression lock against blood-exposing skin from someone 
with HIV -- and it would require some &quot;time&quot; to enable viral 
transfer. We do know of two cases where this was likely. The scenarios were in 
hospital where nurses used their unprotected hands (their hands had open and 
bleeding lesions) to compress bloody wounds on patients infected with HIV. This 
is not casual contact, it's outright forceful blood-to-blood impregnation and 
is indistinguishable from other impregnations such as the sharing of 
&quot;dirty needles.&quot;</p>
<p>People with open skin lesions feel vulnerable to both the facts of 
infection and to the idea of infection. Facts and ideas don't always match, 
however.</p> Date: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 08:46:30 EST From: Tyrone Subject: Skin

<p>I was beginning to wonder about that possibility myself. I am such an

system. (I think I'm getting those terms mostly right.) People with allergies 
have IgE problems, while people with eczema are having trouble with their 
cell-mediated immune systems.</p>
<p>He said that &quot;infiltrates&quot; of certain kinds of immune cells (I 
didn't catch the name) actually get into the skin tissue and cause the itching.

<p>Kristen's story of missing out on two careers really hit home. I had 
interests in science, but my first dissection was my last, due I guess to the 
formaldehyde on my hands. More damaging to me, though, has been my view of 
myself as a person who can not due many ordinary things. I was rashy from the 
age of 3 months on, almost died at 15 months from a massive herpes skin 
infection ( I still get them everywhere), never could crawl on carpet or grass, 
never could pull taffy or do crafts, needed a special cloth on my chair at 
school because my rashy legs stuck to the shellac (this was before girls could 
wear pants) etc. , I still consider myself to be an underachiever, quite 
possibly because of all the things I couldn't do in my formative years because 
of my skin and the feeling that I was fragile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was always glad I wasn't a boy because I was sure I would have been

<p>It interests me to hear that other skin patients direct their anger at the 
medical profession. Myself, I've been fortunate to find doctors who aren't 
aloof and seem sincere in their attempt to help me. The fact that no one has 
found a cure or a safe treatment for eczema isn't our doctors' fault. I have to 
admit that if I were a healthy. wealthy person who wanted to donate billions to 
medical research, I wouldn't select a skin condition that has a low mortality 
rate and that often clears up or gets much better for long periods of time in 
many cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for MY anger, it is directed at those non-allergic clear skin souls who 
offer me catty suggestions or make unkind comments. Once at a large gathering, 
one such person asked me, when we were seated at the table, if I knew that 
there was a big welt on my neck! On another occasion, her sister said that I 
had sinus trouble because I once had a nose job ( it was just to remove a knob 
on the very tip of the nose; no bone or sinus intervention was done). She, a 
&quot;mature&quot; woman, also told me it was disgusting that I did saline 
nasal washes. Their mother has remarked that if I ate a better diet, my skin 
would be clear and that it will be so interesting to see what happens to me at 
menopause! (am I her lab animal?) I also know someone who once had widespread 
eczema and is now completely clear, and has been for years, due to alternative

Feb 1996 22:07:45 EST From: Gilbert Subject: Re: writing the FAQ
<p>Since &quot;eczema&quot; can be a confusingly general term, distinctions 
are in order. For example, we will need to make sure our prospective reader 
does not confuse all eczema &quot;outbreaks&quot; as being one and the same as 
&quot;atopic eczema&quot; (i.e., atopic dermatitis). Also, in any discussions 
where cause-&gt;effect comes into play, we'll need to be clear about what we 
&quot;know&quot; and what we experience; signs and symptoms are not identical 
with disease entity -- yet they are &quot;inextricably&quot; bound up with 
evidentiary causation.</p>
<p>These are slippery slopes -- for lay people and for physicians; they're 
slippery for basic scientists as well: immunologists and bench scientists get 
confounded too. After all, not only are multiple factors at play. . . they're 
playing different games with different folk. The array of variables (situation, 
time; circumstance, environment) makes for confusion.</p>
<p>While we're definitely dealing with physical forces (heredity; 
repetitive-use stress; environmental agents -- you name it!), there are 
psychological forces and &quot;tempers&quot; that confound clinician and 
patient alike.</p>
<p>And even this business: </p>
<p>Which part of the immune system -- humoral? / cellular? -- is involved in 
this or that expression of the eczematous state is unfortunately not as tidy as 
simple assignments would suggest: Yes, eczema [if it's atopic dermatitis!] is 
-- as a lesion -- caused by the &quot;cellular&quot; branch of the immune 
system. The &quot;lesion&quot; we see is an inappropriate event of cellular 
immunity [technically called a &quot;delayed-type hypersensitivity 
response&quot;].</p>
<p>Fine, but then why is it that most people with &quot;atopic 
dermatitis&quot; also have problems with &quot;allergies&quot; and allergens? 
[that's the 'humoral' or antibody arm of the immune system -- the 
&quot;IgE&quot; connection, if you will].</p>
<p>To further the nomenclature, these &quot;allergies&quot; and 
&quot;asthma&quot; are examples of what two pathbreaking researchers by the 
names of Gell and Coombs termed &quot;Type I Hypersensitivity&quot; [allergen 
provokes antibody | provokes-&gt;tissue | provokes: effector-response such as 
rhinitis and asthma].</p>
<p>Scientists Gell and Coombs also classified and termed cell-mediated 
hypersensitivity which they dubbed &quot;Type IV Hypersensitivity.&quot; This 
is where the &quot;cellular branch&quot; of the immune system comes in: 
T-Cells-&gt;intermediate reactions-&gt;eczematic &quot;atopic&quot; dermatitis. 
Though atopic dermatitis is a disease state, the cellular immune response is 
exactly what we try to elicit when we test folk for TB: We want the cellular 
branch of the IS to mount a response. We say to the patient, &quot;Come back in 
two days so I can read your skin.&quot; This delayed response -- it takes the 
T-Cells (they're generals) &quot;time&quot; to communicate down the ranks to 
effector molecules (they're the grunts who do the fighting) -- is a sign that 
the skin is protecting itself. But with atopic dermatitis, it's sort of like 
Don Quixote fighting the windmills. We're not doubting the ability to 
&quot;fight,&quot; we're doubting that the skin should be treated like a 
windmill: Yes, there's a genetic or hereditary component to this cell-mediated 
atopia.</p>
<p>And there's also the same issue of the doubtful opponent with the Type I 
response the asthmatic has: Why is antibody raising the sword against windmills?
</p>
<p>In point of fact and in point of frequency: Type I and Type IV 
hypersensitivity reactions usually belong as symptoms within the same set of 
individuals. Sure, there are exceptions. But, the general pattern is that we 
should not be surprised to find a patient presenting with atopic dermatitis who 
also has food allergies, or asthma, or &quot;hay fever&quot;. Types I and IV 
(usually) go together -- if we're talking about the &quot;atopic state&quot; of 
affairs.</p>
<p>One immune system with two branches (humoral and cellular). And both 
branches bear the fruit of our travail.</p>
<p>Clearly, we don't have easy answers because we don't have an easy problem.

<p>Gil, Your explanation of the immune response was really good and made sense 
to me in terms of what I have experienced lately. You said it took 2 days for 
the skin immune system to react to allergens (as in a TB test). When I was 
flaring so bad when I first started allergy shots, it was always about 48 hours 
after a shot. At first, I thought it was happening because I expected it to 
happen. But one day I got shots; then left the next day on a trip to Asia. As 
we approached Hong Kong, I really flared (assuming it was the peanut dust in 
the airplane air). Counting hours now, I know it was the 48 hour post shot 
reaction. I was totally unaware then of what time it was (my watch was on Asian 
time). Anyhow, the two day lag is something to remember when trying to figure 
out the cause of a flare.</p>

<p>Hi Wren, I pretty much have eczema from head to toe in varying degrees. 
Because I don't like to tolerate the sloughing (it can be embarrassing), I 
shower every night--short showers, maybe 5 minutes. I also wash my hair in the 
shower, which then becomes a 15-20 minute job. Sometimes I'm under the shower 
long enough to feel &quot;soaked,&quot; and then I make sure I cream up all 
over as much as possible.</p>
<p>I also shower at least once daily, sometimes more when I'm having more 
problems. Water gives me the most relief--comfort level is very important to me 
so that I can concentrate on other things. When I'm wet and then creamed up, I 
feel more &quot;loose&quot; with more freely moving joints--if that makes any 
sense.</p>
<p>If I'm in really good condition, I might skip a shower for one night, but 
the daily showering keeps the itch down, and the sensation of not feeling 
&quot;dirty&quot; from loose skin particles. So I prefer more water rather than 
less to keep myself functioning--also, as a safety measure against infection. 
I've used pHisoderm for soaping, Cetaphil lately, and some bar soaps that are 
gentle without perfumes. If you are interested in the bar soaps, I'll check on 
the names.</p>
<p>I can't stand the gooiness of heavy oils, altho occasionally I've used 
small amounts of Vitamin E oil I apply Diprolene to my scalp immediately when 
after a shower when my hair is still wet--it doesn't seem to grease up my hair 
as much as when the hair is dry. I use water to wash off all the dead skin and 
doctor the new stuff underneath. If I don't use water, I end up taking it off

<p>Hi Ralph, You make the tar &quot;toilet&quot; sound very appealing. I'm 
wondering how one would do this as a practical matter for the scalp and entire 
body? A black tub afterwards doesn't appeal to me though! I remember using tar 
in my late teens and early 20s--detested the smell, was sure everyone could 
tell it and would think I had a bad case of body odor. Eventually, I gave it up 
because cortisone was so much &quot;cleaner.&quot;</p>

<p>I shower once a day in as cool water as possible. I use cetaphil bar soap 
on underarms, crotch, and feet. (my feet are pretty clear). Right now I'm using 
regular shampoo , but when scalp is bad, I use T-gel. I put Eucerin creme on 
all over after drying. (when I'm feeling impoverished and using vaseline, 
Idon't dry myself at all.) Then I put cortisone on the bad spots. At night I 
wash my face with cetaphil liquid cleanser and put Eucerin creme all over.</p>
<p>Here's some things that are on the edge, but I want to share them. I find 
that shaving my underarms and legs very lightly with an electric razor really 
helps as long as the skin isn't real bad. My derm doctor suggested I try this 
to help exfoliate. I also think the vibration of the razor serves as a scratch 
substitute and I am experimenting with this on the arms too.</p>
<p>I am going thru some real tough emotional stuff right now. It's in the 
man-woman area. My skin is really good. I think it's because there's so much 
natural adrenaline and cortisol in my system. I think I talked with Shelley 
about this long ago. Does anyone else experience this?</p>
<p>I also became acquainted with someone who does psychic healing. I let him 
give me a couple of sessions. (it was for free). Maybe it was the placebo 
effect or the stress and crying I mentioned above, but skin and sinuses got 
better and the lymph node went way down.</p> Date: Sat, 24 Feb 1996 13:33:08

<p>I have full body eczema, Wren. What works for me is taking a shower once a

and more ointment for problem spots. For me, it's most important to feel 
&quot;clean&quot;, dryness is lower priority. I itch more from too much grease 
than I do from dryness. But sometimes I feel dry-itchy and need spot wash with 
creams; sometimes I put on too much ointment and it's too greasy and the skin 
needs to breathe; other times I can tell that it's probably getting infected 
and I need Cleocin-T. There are numerous feelings of discomfort and itch and 
over time I've learned to understand what the nuances signify and what 
treatment is required for each feeling. Of course, sometimes I misinterpret the 
feeling and that causes more problems, but basically, it's learning my own body 
language and forms of communication. Sometimes it feels like our bodies are new

Ezra has it quite bad on his face, mostly on his cheeks and a little on his

<p>Hi Eric, Believe it or not, we were all children at one time! My mother 
used to make me wear soft leggings/mitts/gloves over my hands especially when I 
was a small kid. Over time I wore holes right through the cloth because itching 
was beyond my control. When the hand coverings were new and I couldn't itch 
effectively, I used to scratch as far as possible using my toenails!</p>
<p>But keeping fingernails very very short and frequent handwashing is very 
important to keep from tearing up the skin and preventing infection. Tylenol 
for kids might help take the edge off your child's nerves--I used to take heavy 
duty transquilizers--a mere palliative but it makes one so dopey and lethargic. 
I still rely on aspirin or something similar if I feel antsy. Good luck.&nbsp;

<p>Zetar doesn't stick to the tub in any appreciable amount. You just rinse,

and cracked.</p>
<p>I think this form of emulsion (Zetar, the one with 
&quot;polysorbates&quot;) might be relatively new. I have used various forms of 
tar since I was a child, and this stuff, though smelly, is in a different 
league from the others.</p>

nothing.</p>
<p>The dermatologist prescribed his usual combination of oral antibiotics, tar 
baths, and twice-daily applications of Diprolene (steriod) ointment. My son's 
eczema cleared up after the two-week treatment, which we performed assiduously, 
and has never returned! His skin still gets a bit itchy from time to time, and 
we put on a bit of Diprolene, but there has never again been any significant

<p>About coal tar's mode of action. Many theories have been suggested, but the

professional paper published by Lowe et al. in 1983. Lowe and his group showed 
that coal tar has &quot;antimitotic effects&quot; and proposes that that might 
account for some of its action and effect. In other words, coal tar discourages 
cell replication. Since one of the troubles with psoriasis and some eczemas is 
the observed &quot;thickening&quot; of the skin which tends to 
&quot;crack&quot; and form &quot;scales,&quot; we're observing a phenomenon 
called &quot;hyperplasia,&quot; i.e., the skin's over-achiever attempt to 
regenerate and displace &quot;because of the injury.&quot; If an 
&quot;antimitotic&quot; agent can slow down this process, it is conceivable 
that it can provide some benefit.</p> Date: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 23:52:34 -0500

<p>Dear Eric, Please have Ezra seen to by a dermatologist if you've not 
already done so. The main reason that he's doing a Houdini is because it 
itches. A mild topical corticosteroid (eg 1% hydrocortisone or maybe something 
a little stronger-if he needs it) and emollients can give lots of relief. Many 
infants with atopic dermatitis are clear of it by their second birthday but to 
wait a year and a half would be a little unfair to the child.</p>
<p>Many parents view treatment of AD with steroid creams with a great deal of 
apprehension and suspicion but topical steroids used appropriately and 
judiciously, are invaluable in treating AD. Moisturizers equally so.</p>
<p>Though there is probably some truth in the saying &quot;to itch is only 
human but to scratch, divine&quot;, somehow I do not think little Ezra 
appreciates it.</p>
<p>I agree with Ralph and feel that too many people (including doctors) spend 
too much time pussy-footing around with the treatment of AD in infants. I hope 
that I'm not being too outspoken but I've seen too many children (and 
indirectly, their parents) suffer unneccessarily from this attitude (which 
basically arises from ignorance). So get little Houdini treated and maybe he 
won't be stuck with the nickname for life.</p> Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 10:54:39

<p>There's another dimension to the itching in infancy which I forgot to 
mention in my last message. My son was small for his age, eating very little, 
at the time we finally had him seen by the dermatologist. We wondered if there 
was a connection between the eczema and the loss of appetite, and he told us 
that babies with eczema usually don't eat well.</p>
<p>According to this line of thinking, the young child's sensory apparatus is 
overwhelmed with the itching, and doesn't process other sensations like hunger 
very well. As a result (so goes the theory), the child doesn't really know when 
s/he is hungry.</p>
<p>At 7, our son is still small for his age, but strong and healthy, and we're 
very glad we had him treated.</p> Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 09:37:04 PST From:

<p>Wren, I've never actually documented--just recall skin problems when my

when I feel miserable I don't want to be around people. I've gone through lots

<p>I limit myself to a few good friends and superficial contacts with others,

conversation on a daily basis--most of it less than profound. I'm not 
interested in someone's latest foray to the grocery store, if you know what I 
mean. Books are usually more interesting to me than people. I don't like the 
aimless busyness I see all around me--not much of sense behind the busyness 
generally. I've lived alone since I was 27--big change at the time, but I 
wouldn't go back to the chaos I grew up in. Solitude is very important to 
me--more important than people just for the sake of people. That's probably why 
I like this List---it's great to communicate with people like yourself, but I

<p>I was struck by your reference to Houdini. He was my idol as a child 
because my parents would tie me up in restraints (handcuffs, strait jackets, 
ropes, chains, you name it) to keep me from scratching but I would always 
figure out how to escape - a la Houdini! And then I would get my revenge by 
scratching even more furiously! Restraints may have helped me keep from 
scratching for certain periods of time but psychologically they were the worst 
thing for me. To this day I still am negatively affected by that experience. I 
cannot emphasize enough that it's an awful thing to do to a child. I know it's 
difficult for very young children to have any self-control. I recommend keeping 
the fingernails extremely short, encouraging the child to hold something in the 
hand at night, bite the arm or whatever's in reach, or to pinch or slap the 
skin lightly instead of scratching, but don't tie them down! What worked best 
for me is when I learned to tuck my hands under my butt and pretend they were 
paralyzed. Later I learned to touch my fingertips together one by one in a slow

venting anger more easily may very well increase the level of anger one attains 
more easily, and, therefore a &quot;ventor&quot; of anger may actually operate 
at a higher anger level most of the time because becoming angry happens more 
easily and venting is a pleasureable, ok activity if that makes sense to anyone 
else. Also, I find that it has become much harder for me to accept other people 
in friendships and to make friends as I have gotten older...I don't have the

<p>Hi Robert, Welcome back. Good to hear you did so well in the sun. You must 
not be an inveterate cortisone user. My skin doesn't like sun anymore--it just 
gets mottled and burns in spots. Altho some antibiotics use precludes exposure 
to sun also. Perhaps you would agree that the psyche is a big factor in eczema 
now that you've come back to the ratrace.</p>
<p>I disagree with your conclusions about anger. I think it is better to find 
ways to vent anger than bottle it up. I don't think it's very pleasureable to 
&quot;spout,&quot; altho it may be necessary. Sometimes blowing it off takes 
the pressure off the &quot;cooker.&quot; One's level of anger may be 
commensurate with an incident; because sometimes anger is very justified. I 
don't like to think that anger is bad just because it's anger. Venting it, and 
then thinking thru the reasons for it may be more beneficial, along with 
deciding to handle it differently. Rather than just complaining, better to take 
some kind of action.</p>
<p>Anger has never been an acceptable emotion for women to show--doesn't mean 
we don't have it. We've always just been taught a &quot;lady&quot; doesn't show
