<h2>social theory&nbsp;undergrads</h2> 
<p>with 12 comments</p> 
<p>Why is social theory hard for students? After teaching many sections, I 
offer a few answers to this question. This is based on teaching a lot of public 
university students, many of whom postpone theory until the bitter end.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The difficulty level of the readings is far beyond what is normally 
encountered in other courses. Compare a passage from Durkheim or Weber with 
what you find in an intro text or an anthology of readings on race, and 
you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</li> 
<li>Many students in sociology class don&rsquo;t have an interest, or express 
an interest, in current events, history, philosophy, or other topics that would 
lead them to think a lot about the social world in a systematic way.</li> 
<li>A lot of courses are topical in orientation. Thus, there is no systematic 
discussion of dependent/independent variables, social processes, and so forth. 
In a lot of big public schools, social theory is a weird stand alone course. It 
is not integrated with others.</li> 
<li>Social theory books themselves present a problem. Finding a connection 
between empirical topics and social theories is hard.</li> </ol> 
<p>One might interpret this post as a complaint against the buffet style 
sociology major, where students just take a bunch of disconnected courses. That 
is correct. At many programs, including my own, there is no logical sequencing 
of courses. Students take intro or social problems, then topics, and then a 
little stats and theory. Thus, there is no cultivation of systematic thinking.
</p> 
<p>Another interpretation is that sociology attracts the wrong kind of 
student. If there are not an appreciable number of students with a strong 
knowledge of current events, history, or other fields that would facilitate 
learning social theory, then it means we&rsquo;re failing to attract these 
students.We have to do a better job getting the most engaged social science 
students.</p> 
<p>Social theory instructors, please leave your comments.</p>

<h2>sociology as a hard science&nbsp;major</h2> 
<p>with 18 comments</p> 
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we offer a &ldquo;hard science&rdquo; sociology track? If 
you teach at a university with a lot of decent social science departments, 
it&rsquo;s an easy major to implement. Except for math soc, all the courses are 
there already. My version:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Intro soc</li> 
<li>Research methods</li> 
<li>Social theory</li> 
<li>Basic stats (hypothesis testing) + applied regression analysis</li> 
<li>Microeconomics</li> 
<li>Demography</li> 
<li>Social Network Analysis</li> 
<li>Mathematical Sociology/computational models</li> 
<li>Intro game theory</li> 
<li>Breadth: a few courses in qualitative topics; three courses of topics in 
sociology (like race, gender, education, etc.); a capstone course</li> </ul> 
<p>The background that a student would need is about 1 year of calculus and 
some computer literacy. The only course that soc depts don&rsquo;t already 
offer is math soc. But I think that could be offered, or made an elective. At a 
competitive R1 school, I&rsquo;d imagine that you could get 3-4 majors per 
year. A minor could probably bag you 5-8 students per year. I bet a few hard 
science types would be happy to tack it on as a double major. And the cost 
would be zero.</p>

<h2>sociology and management phd program admissions &ndash; comments and 
open&nbsp;thread</h2> 
<p>with 43 comments</p> 
<p>My Facebook news feed is filled with colleagues commenting on graduate 
program admissions. Let me take this opportunity to make a few comments and 
open it up for discussion.</p> 
<p>1. If you are applying to IU, I am quite sorry. We probably won&rsquo;t be 
offering you admissions. It&rsquo;s just a fact. We reject the overwhelming 
majority of applicants, including many who will go on and have great careers in 
sociology.</p> 
<p>2. The rest of my comments are directed at faculty who are serving on 
admissions committees. First, departments vary in their strategies and 
procedures. Here are IU, we read through every single application. Of course, 
some folders get more attention than others. The folks with rock bottom 
GRE&rsquo;s and a 2.9 GPA won&rsquo;t get more than a quick glance, if that.</p>
<p>We do read a lot of folders in detail because IU employs a sort of 
&ldquo;Moneyball&rdquo; strategy. We look for diamonds in the rough. A lot of 
our star students, who go on to dominate the job market, were high performers 
at relatively low status schools. So we don&rsquo;t rely on a steady feed of 
polished applicants from the West Coast and Ivy League. We find the gems from 
the liberal arts and public schools of the Midwest and South. It&rsquo;s a 
strategy that requires reading folders closely, but it pays off in spades. IU 
has great students.</p> 
<p>3. It is hard to develop meaningful distinctions with a certain class of 
students. You might call them the stereotype sociology undergrads. The profile 
is that they major in sociology and have a decent GPA. They also have decent 
verbal scores, but bad to miserable math scores. Unless they can make the case 
that their math score is an aberration (e.g., they did well in freshman 
calculus), it&rsquo;s hard for them to move to the top of the pile.</p> 
<p>4. Admissions committees often have trouble interpreting applications from 
foreign countries. Sometimes it&rsquo;s language, sometimes it&rsquo;s simply a 
different grading system. Also, you have to work extra hard to distinguish 
between students who are more interested in migration than the academic career. 
Some regions have a reputation for less than trustworthy credentials. 
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good to consult with colleagues from those 
nations&nbsp; if there&rsquo;s a candidate who might be a good fit. If I were 
to advise foreign applicants, I&rsquo;d insist that they show that they 
&ldquo;get it&rdquo; (i.e., understand academia) and have a credible signal of 
commitment to academia.</p> 
<p>5. Letters of recommendation: My opinion of letters continues to slide over 
time. The more I do admissions, they more flaws I see. First, there is little 
variance among letter writers. Second, there is a double selection effect. 
Students only approach profs who like them and who have given them good grades. 
Third, a lot of letters are obviously lame. For example, I have read many 
letters that insisted the student was top notch (top 1% or 5%), yet the 
GRE&rsquo;s and GPA were clearly atrocious. Fourth, a lot of students, 
especially those in low status schools or who have non-academic employment, 
have letter writers who are not in a position to write honest and thoughtful 
evaluations. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of letters by bosses, academic advisers, 
project supervisors, and so forth. I don&rsquo;t count it against students, but 
it doesn&rsquo;t help.</p> 
<p>6. The 1% of letters:&nbsp; Still, every once in a while, there&rsquo;s a 
letter that makes a clear and compelling case for a student. The profile of the 
letter writer is that they are an active teacher and researcher. They provide 
some concrete evidence that the student is actually exceptional, or that they 
are better than the transcript. They often have extensive experience with the 
applicant, or they can explain why the performance in one course is remarkable. 
Sadly, I&rsquo;ve read only four or five letters that fit this mold, out of 
hundreds. The rest are generic and uninformative.</p> 
<p>7. Random thoughts: Statements are good for sorting students, but only 
broadly. If the applicant is interested in social work or activism, academic 
sociology isn&rsquo;t a good fit. I read transcripts carefully to spot 
praiseworthy or suspicious behavior (e.g., lots of withdrawals, hard courses, 
upward trajectories). Writing samples are good measures on general writing, but 
still, I am reluctant to make a decision on a product that was often not 
originally intended to be research sociology (e.g., a term paper in history or 
a policy report).</p>

<h2>matt yglesias kind of gets it right on science profs and 
science&nbsp;majors</h2> 
<p>with 8 comments</p> 
<p>Matt Yglesias has a short article at Slate about STEM (science, technology, 
engineering, and math). The article is called &ldquo;Do STEM Faculties Want 
Undergraduates to Study STEM fields?&rdquo; Yglesias focuses on different 
funding structures and TA&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d focus on faculty funding 
formulas. Faculty and graduate student funding in the sciences relies heavily 
on external income sources. In the social science and humanities, funding is 
mainly internal. Deans allocate FTEs (faculty lines) and graduate program class 
sizes (# of PhD students) based on a combination of merit and, more 
importantly, enrollments. Thus, you have an incentive to created bloated 
undergraduate majors, which leads to more grad students. It&rsquo;s not the 
other way around &ndash; large grad students do not lead to more majors.</p> 
<p>The incentives do not encourage strong teaching in the sciences. While 
people don&rsquo;t intentionally teach bad, they do in practice because there 
is no reason to do otherwise. Consider the typical experience of a freshman in 
a big science department:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>They are a decent student in an American high school.</li> 
<li>They are thrown into a large lecture class with little supervision, except 
maybe the once a week lab or discussion section.</li> 
<li>The TA&rsquo;s have no teaching experience. They often have bad language 
skills.</li> 
<li>Grading is often punitive &ndash; curves are often used. Students can 
still get crummy grades even if they learn a fair amount of material.</li> </ul>
<p>Adding insult to injury,&nbsp; a lot of fields, like physics, have poor job 
prospects, especially for people with only a BA. Furthermore, graduate schools 
in law and medicine don&rsquo;t give you credit for a low GPA just because it 
was in a hard major. STEM is a raw deal for marginal students. Why bother with 
this insanely hard major that is badly taught and will punish you with low 
grades? Switch to a different field, get decent grades, and have a real career.

<h2>sociology is harder than you&nbsp;think</h2> 
<p>with 17 comments</p> 
<p>A few weeks ago, I noted that Indiana sociology is one of the stingiest 
graders in the university. About 30% of our grades are A&rsquo;s, making us the 
10th toughest grader in the university. From internal data, I know sociology 
gives lower grades than the rest of the College of Arts and Sciences, which 
gives lower grades than the rest of the university. It also turns out that 
I&rsquo;m aGPA Terminator. In my large lecture in social theory, about 10% got 
any version of an A, with a single unadorned A.</p> 
<p>I am not alone. The comments on the original post suggest that at a number 
of schools sociology tends to be harder than most majors in terms of grades. 
One commenter noted that sociology might just be graded harder. True. Sociology 
isn&rsquo;t nuclear physics, but there some reasons to think that sociology is 
harder than it looks.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Most sociology programs requires one semester of statistics, which 
can&rsquo;t be faked.</li> 
<li>You have to take social theory &ndash; which is reading hard original 
texts from authors like Weber, Marx, Durkheim, and so forth. It&rsquo;s like 
taking a course in Western civ. at a place like Chicago.</li> 
<li>A lot of sociological research is not narrative, like history. Rather, 
it&rsquo;s about variables, even when it&rsquo;s historical.</li> 
<li>Sociology instructors expect writing that combines variables/analytic 
thinking with college level expository writing.</li> </ol> 
<p>Students are attracted to sociology because it&rsquo;s accessible and many 
think it will be easy. Instead, they get this Frankenstein major that requires 
some math, some philosophy, analytical/deductive thinking, and clear writing. 
Few students possess all of these skills at once, which is why the grades are 
lower than in comparable majors.</p>

<h2>social movement bleg: source materials on specific&nbsp;movements</h2> 
<p>with 9 comments</p> 
<p>In Spring 2012, I will be teaching a course on social movements. The 
audience is composed of seniors. It is a capstone course.</p> 
<p>The first four weeks will be a series of case studies on the following 
movements:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Civil Rights movement</li> 
<li>Women&rsquo;s rights in America</li> 
<li>The Bolshevik revolution</li> 
<li>The Tea Party</li> </ul> 
<p>I&rsquo;m dealing with young folks who won&rsquo;t have a lot of first hand 
knowledge of movements. So I am spending one week for each of these four 
movements. We&rsquo;ll read the wiki for each, watch some documentaries, etc. 
The second part of the course will be the traditional social science approach 
to movements (e.g. theories of grievances, recruitment, etc.).</p> 
<p>But I still want people to read a good &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the facts&rdquo; 
summary for each case. For example: What&rsquo;s a Bolshevik? What did they 
want? Who were the Bolshevik leaders? What were the big outcomes of the 
communist movement? Academic articles rarely do this basic factual description. 
Before we get to theory, I want people to actually know some cases.</p> 
<p>So what short texts are good descriptions of these movements? I don&rsquo;t 
want long books, but essays, encyclopedia entries, journalistic summaries, 
Contexts articles, etc. I need a lot of facts, but I am trying to keep the 
reading reasonable and the total book costs low.</p>

<h2>ivy league admissions vs. ivy league job&nbsp;prospects</h2> 
<p>with 21 comments</p> 
<p>Two conflicting themes about elite institutions:</p> 
<p>1. Many Ivy League students are selected on political grounds &ndash; 
legacies, athletes, and various &ldquo;well rounded&rdquo; kids:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Researchers with access to closely guarded college admissions data have 
found that, on the whole, about 15 percent of freshmen enrolled at 
America&rsquo;s highly selective colleges are white teens who failed to meet 
their institutions&rsquo;<em><strong>minimum</strong></em> admissions standards.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This report is about minimum standards. Lots of other kids probably meet 
minimum requirements but probably wouldn&rsquo;t be competitive if it 
weren&rsquo;t for being children of alumni.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;2. Recruiters from elite law, consulting, and investment banks 
exclusively focus on about three or four elite colleges. SeeCaplan&rsquo;s 
review of Lauren Rivera&rsquo;s ethnography of elite firm recruiting for 
details. The take home points:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Elite firms have no time to sort through people.</li> 
<li>Nearly all applicants from low status schools (e.g., the &ldquo;public 
Ivies&rdquo; like Michigan or Berkeley or any other non-HYP school) are tossed 
in the trash without review.</li> 
<li>There&rsquo;s a signalling of habitus &ndash; applicants need the right 
interactional skills, the right major, the right extra-curriculars, showing 
similarity to the recruiter</li> 
<li>There&rsquo;s&nbsp; modest amount of evaluation based on performance (SAT 
or GPA), but not a lot.</li> </ul> 
<p>So what gives? Are elite firms stupid? Do they not know that a huge chunk 
of Ivy league graduates simply don&rsquo;t have what it takes to get into Ivy 
League colleges without the help of mom and dad? If they do know, why do they 
keep hiring these people?</p> 
<p>A few answers:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>&nbsp;These firms are selling legitimacy. Buyers want the comfort of the 
Ivy League brand, so there&rsquo;s&nbsp;a premium. For this story to work, you 
need to believe that these services &ndash; investment banking, consulting 
&ndash; can be easily taught to people who aren&rsquo;t geniuses.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Heterogeneity. Yes, Ivy League schools have dim kids, but they do 
accept lots of brilliant people as well. So just hire a bunch of them and fire 
those that fare poorly, which is the strategy for many investment firms.</li> 
<li>Opacity. It&rsquo;s hard to assign credit to specific people in these 
industries. So the whiz kid math majors who do the mental heavy lifting have to 
share credit (and paychecks) with the legacy kids. That allows the system of 
hiring by college to survive.</li> </ol> 
<p>Add your own explanations.</p>

<h2>college fundamentalism vs. college&nbsp;realism</h2> 
<p>with 24 comments</p> 
<p>I have argued that we have too much college. I have also argued that it may 
not be wise for everyone to go to college considering the astronomical cost. 
These views have attraced much criticism on this blog.</p> 
<p>So why do I stick to these views? As a blogger, I do enjoy the debate, but 
there&rsquo;s a more important reason for supporting an unpopular view: I am a 
&ldquo;college realist.&rdquo; I do not take a religious stance toward 
education. Formal schooling is a tool to an end. If the tool fails to do its 
job, I can live without it.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s the alternative? I think there are three positions one can 
take toward education:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>College fundamentalism: College is always good for everyone. Everyone 
should have it no matter the cost or the measured effect. We should massively 
subsidize college for anyone who asks for it.</li> 
<li>College realism: College is good for some people, but maybe not for 
everyone. The benefits of college should be compared to the costs and 
liabilities.</li> 
<li>College skepticism: College is mainly a waste of time. It is not needed 
and we should dismantle higher education.</li> </ul> 
<p>There are educational skeptics. Home schooling might be seen as K-12 
skepticism. The writer Ivan Illich argued that we needed to 
&ldquo;deschool&rdquo; society. But there aren&rsquo;t too many hard core 
skeptics.&nbsp;Rather, the big debate is between college fundamentalists and 
college realists.</p> 
<p>There are many college fundamentalists. For example, policy makers in 
America often promote more student loans to increase enrollments. Education 
researchers spend more time, relatively speaking, on access (getting people 
into college) than impact (see how it matters). The knee jerk reaction to 
proposal to limit or shrink college education is a symptom.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m a realist because there&rsquo;s too much evidence&nbsp;against a 
fundamentalist position. We know that many students fail out of college and 
those that remain fail to learn much. And it isn&rsquo;t because of finances. 
Many students lack the ability or maturity to complete college. 
&nbsp;Furthermore, there&rsquo;s evidence that college is overpriced relative 
to future earnings. This all suggests to me that college education should be 
focused, not given to all who ask.</p> 
<p>I think the right policy stance for a college realist is &ldquo;targeted 
access.&rdquo; Rather than try to get every kid into college regardless of 
academic skills, we should focus on people who have the ability and desire to 
succeed. The wealthy will take of themselves. We -&nbsp;the higher education 
community &ndash; should instead work on identifying promising young people 
from less wealthy families and building financial resources, like endowments 
and grants, that will make college affordable for these people. Our efforts 
should be on identification of merit,&nbsp;targetting people who need help, and 
price control, not merit-blind loans and other policies that bloat and distort 
higher education.</p>

<h2>orgtheory poll: college and&nbsp;jobs</h2> 
<p>with 4 comments</p> <br>
Take Our Poll 
<p>In the social sciences, there&rsquo;s a big debate over schooling and 
income. One theory, human capital, says that school gives you specific skills. 
The major alternative is that school is a de facto IQ test. You don&rsquo;t 
learn many job skills in college, but employers pay more for college graduates 
because they have shown a basic level of discipline and intelligence. This 
theory is called signalling. What do you think?</p>

<h2>social theory midterm results: a behavioral&nbsp;approach</h2> 
<p>with 8 comments</p> 
<p><em>Eighty percent of success is showing up.</em> &ndash; Woody Allen</p> 
<p>I have a hypothesis, shared by many social scientists, that life course 
outcomes are highly correlated with self-discipline. If you are the kind of 
person who can follow the rules, you&rsquo;ll probably do well. This is an 
average statement, of course. In certain contexts, rule breaking is wonderful, 
but life usually requires rule following and a measure of self-discipline.</p> 
<p>To test this hypothesis, I conducted a simple statistical test with data 
from my social theory class (N=73). I collected two behavioral/discipline 
variables: did the students show up to two randomly selected classes and did 
students use their &ldquo;free pass,&rdquo; which allows them to skip a daily 
writing assignment. I then merged attendance, assignment completion, and 
midterm performance data.</p> 
<p>The results:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Skipping the daily writing assignment is *not* correlated with midterm 
performance, except for &ldquo;extreme skipping.&rdquo; A handful of students 
skipped four or more daily write ups, thus wildly exceeding the &ldquo;free 
pass&rdquo; rule. They score 19% less than the rest of the class.</li> 
<li>Attendance is correlated with midterm performance. Class skipping is 
associated with a 10.1% grade drop.</li> 
<li>In the OLS model with dummies for attendance on either day and skipping 1, 
2, 3 and 4 (or more), the results are the same.</li> </ul> 
<p>The R-squared?&nbsp; .27!!! Wow. Knowing nothing else about the students, 
like GPA, SAT, or SES, I can account for a lot of variance by just seeing if 
they show up and hand in assignments.</p>

<h2>thoughts on a chicago graduate&nbsp;education</h2> 
<p>with 3 comments</p> 
<p>A while ago, I wrote a post at Marginal Revolution called &ldquo;Thoughts 
on a Berkeley Education.&rdquo; Consider this a follow up &ndash; my thoughts 
on my doctoral education at Chicago.</p> 
<p>First, some downsides.&nbsp;Chicago is&nbsp;not exactly a touchy feely 
place. The funding was horriblenon-existent&nbsp;and the environment was in 
many ways unsupportive.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard that they&rsquo;ve reformed 
graduate student financial support, which is welcome. I also hope that 
the&nbsp;odd structurelessness of the place has changed.</p> 
<p>Despite these issues, I don&rsquo;t regret going there for a second. 
Chicago is a truly unique institution, but not because it is highy ranked in 
the academic world. There are lots of campuses with smart people. Rather, 
it&rsquo;s a truly intellectual place. The place just exudes this atmosphere 
that is really hard to find at other schools, even other top notch universities.
</p> 
<p>The key to understanding the Chicago experience is that it is based on 
purely intellectual pursuits. Sports barely register. The undergraduate 
curriculum is based on a &ldquo;core&rdquo; that covers classic writings. 
Students are actually interested in the readings and aren&rsquo;t just day 
dreaming about that sweet post-graduation finance job.The bathroom graffiti 
refers to Greek philosophy and post-colonial theory.&nbsp; They once even had a 
protest<em>in favor</em> of a foreign language requirement. It&rsquo;s that 
kind of place.</p> 
<p>Sociology, I think, has a special place at Chicago. Yes, there are other 
prestigious departments, but Chicago&rsquo;s program was one of the first, 
possibly the first, in the 1890s. At Chicago, it has the distinction of having 
been the birthplace of a discipline. And it&rsquo;s maintained its position 
since then. So when you go the room with the dissertations, you are seeing a 
room with dissertation ranging from Erving Goffman to Andy Abbott. Some, like 
Nathan Hare and Gerald McWhorter, went on to found<em>other</em> disciplines 
like Ethnic Studies. Truly humbling.</p> 
<p>The way it rubs off on graduate students, for better or worse, is that PhD 
students are allowed to think big, be ambitious. That can backfire, as some 
students need dissertation projects that are modest. But with the right person, 
it can be liberating. The Chicago attitude isn&rsquo;t always &ldquo;get 
published,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;write something that&rsquo;s really 
important.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

<p>with 8 comments</p> 
<p>I have played around a bit with&nbsp;Prezi, the whizbang presentation 
software that Tedsters, Hans Rosling (actually, here&rsquo;s&nbsp;GapMinder) 
and other cool people use.</p> 
<p>Some quick takes on Prezi.</p> 
<p>The positives:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>visual focus</li> 
<li>nice macro layouts and views</li> 
<li>cloud-desktop interface very handy</li> 
<li>sure to impress some audiences</li> 
<li>quite easy to use</li> 
<li>big bonus: the company is very nice to educators &ndash; you can download 
a free desktop version (with 500MB of memory)</li> 
<li>relatively easy to &ldquo;Prezify&rdquo; old keynote or powerpoint slides 
&ndash; I converted some old slides and it was seamless (though, you have to go 
from pdf to Prezi &ndash; which creates within-slide limitations)</li> 
<li>some cool collaboration options (haven&rsquo;t tried them though)</li> 
<li>handles images beautifully</li> </ul> 
<p>Negatives:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>gimmicky</li> 
<li>very gimmicky</li> 
<li>remember that first 1995 presentation you saw with slide transitions, you 
know, where the presenter proudly smirked with each transition &ndash; Prezi 
feels like that (I &nbsp;saw someone present with Prezi and the emphasis 
clearly was on the fact that the presenter was using Prezi, not the content)
</li> 
<li>shoot me if someone pulls up with their iPad2 and plugs in a Prezi &ndash; 
though the cloud might obviate that</li> </ul> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably be using Prezi in some settings (BTW: you can explore 
Prezi presentations here). &nbsp;It has some nice features.</p> 
<p>Though, in terms of teaching, I&rsquo;ve tried to move away from more than 
one slide per each class (I&rsquo;m a chalkboard kinda guy these days), so 
perhaps not for class. &nbsp;I have a gazillion slides for any given class but 
I prefer to talk through the issues. &nbsp;For academic presentations, I think 
simplicity is good. &nbsp;Whizbang just distracts (though, the whizbang factor 
can also be dialed down in Prezi as well). &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll probably stick with 
good ol&rsquo; keynote, google and/or ppt &ndash; until further notice.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering -&nbsp;what makes for a good academic 
presentation?&nbsp; For now, it seems that the&nbsp;research question, idea 
itself and you have to shine. &nbsp;If the technology distracts, then that is a 
problem.</p>

<h2>berkeley police beat unarmed poet; arrested english prof speaks&nbsp;out
</h2> 
<p>with 3 comments</p> 
<p>1. A news report indicates that poetry professor &amp; Pulitzer prize 
winner Geoffrey O&rsquo;Brien was beaten by police at Berkeley. The 70 year old 
(!) professor suffered broken ribs after being hit by police batons.</p> 
<p>2. Celeste Langan has blogged about her arrest by the Berkeley police 
department:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As to why I was there: as a tenured professor (and tenure can be defined as 
a right granted to occupy a position on campus without threat of eviction for 
expressing dissent) I wanted to express my concern about the double threat 
posed to the ideal of liberal education by the rising cost of tuition and, more 
generally, the burden of debt. On the one hand, as many have pointed out, 
rising costs limit access. On the other hand, the debt students incur as they 
pursue a liberal arts education also poses a threat to free inquiry, that 
central value of democratic society.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that Langan and other faculty are speaking about the 
intellectual consequences of college debt.&nbsp;Readers may think I&rsquo;m 
anti-humanities. The opposite is true.&nbsp;I like &ldquo;useless college 
majors,&rdquo; but&nbsp;debt&nbsp;undermines the humanities and other fields 
(like sociology!). People will rightfully resent education and the labor 
market. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m worried about. When we make education into 
a high priced job placement test, it undermines the liberal arts. We need to 
stop that from happening further.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;The police, who are given the impossible mission of using 
&ldquo;minimal force&rdquo;&ndash;a concept with similar conceptual 
ambiguity&ndash;in the pressure of the moment, also did not take time to think, 
to consider a response appropriate to the circumstances. But I noticed that 
after the arrest, they took sweet time&mdash;something like four hours&mdash;to 
write reports and &ldquo;book&rdquo; us, and then, after another four or five 
hours, to release us from jail. The delay was caused in part by the initial 
haste: the officers trying to write the reports had no idea who the arresting 
officers were, and therefore no idea of what we should be charged with. 
According to the ACLU, they then violated procedure by not releasing us 
immediately after issuing the misdemeanor citations.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Police are at great liberty in how they deal with protest. In seven years 
of field work watching protests, I&rsquo;ve seen it all. In my 
experience,&nbsp;the normal situation is that police peacefully arrest 
protesters who want &nbsp;to be arrested for symbolic purposes. They also do 
their best to arrest the small fraction of violent protesters. What Langan, and 
others, have experienced is neither normal or necessary.</p>

<h2>dance&nbsp;majors</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>Ok, I promise this will be the last post for a while about college majors 
and income. There&rsquo;s an old paper in the Journal of Cultural Economics on 
the careers of undergraduate dance majors.What Becomes of Undergraduate Dance 
Majors? was written by Sarah Montgomery and Michael Robinson. Some take home 
points:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Dance majors tend to give the career about 10 years before switching to 
non-dance.</li> 
<li>Those still in dance do dance about 10-15 hours a week and often must 
supplement their income.</li> 
<li>In the 1990s, dance performers (who majored in dance) made about $15k+ 
less than people who had switched to all non-dance employment</li> 
<li>Graduate education in dance seems to follow employment in dance. My guess 
is that further training allows successful dance to become instructors because 
dance is hard to do at later ages.</li> </ol> 
<p>With respect to the debate we had about useless college majors, the main 
point is&nbsp;that dance is probably like many fields in that it is very hard 
to continue after graduation. As long as dance education is inexpensive, 
that&rsquo;s not such a big deal. If peopl want to pursue the dream, 
that&rsquo;s great. But huge college debt makes that choice hard to sustain.</p>

<h2>how long is the optimal tenure&nbsp;clock?</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>I have heard that several schools have recently moved their tenure clocks 
back (from six to eight years).&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenure clocks do vary significantly 
from university to university, from five-six years to ten or so years.</p> 
<p>So, what is the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; tenure clock?</p> 
<p>A short clock seems to have some advantages.&nbsp; Scholarly productivity 
can be evident early on, so a short clock perhaps makes sense. Perhaps a short 
clock instills an appropriate sense of urgency about publishing. &nbsp; Though, 
I have seen several people not get tenure somewhere, move to a 
&ldquo;higher-ranked&rdquo; school and then get tenure shortly 
thereafter.&nbsp; A longer clock gives scholars time to establish themselves 
further, to develop a reputation (citations are often used as a measure &ndash; 
and this takes time), etc. And, certain types of work (ethnographies) and 
certain types of publishing (books) can take quite long.</p> 
<p>Of course, tenure clocks are used in different ways at different 
schools.&nbsp; Some schools pride themselves on rejecting tenure candidates 
&ndash; so perhaps a short clock makes sense there.</p> 
<p>Anyways &ndash; any thoughts, is there an optimal tenure clock?</p>

<h2>why job hungry students choose useless&nbsp;majors</h2> 
<p>with 14 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Last week, I linked to data showing that the growth degrees awarded has 
often come from non-vocational areas (NVA), such as the humanities. This has 
lead some folks, like Arnold Kling,to conjecture that this is a result of 
anti-profit mentalities among students.</p> 
<p>You can test that hypothesis. The charts are from a UCLA report called The 
American Freshman: Thirty Year Trends &ndash; 1966-1996. It shows, using a 
yearly survey of freshmen, that college students are becoming more interested 
in making money. In 1971, about 50% went to college to make money. In the 
1990s, it&rsquo;s about 70%. Similarly, modern college students are more 
interested in financial stability, not philosophical issues. I haven&rsquo;t 
been able to find more recent data, but I&rsquo;d be surprised if that trend 
reversed. Also, more recent UCLA data from the 2000s shows that around 60% to 
70% of college students, depending on the question, want more job career advice 
from their college.</p> 
<p>Colleges are filled with people who are there because they think it will 
lead to jobs. So, then, why are job hungry students flooding non-vocational 
areas? The explanation is fairly simple.&rdquo;Good&rdquo; jobs require college 
degrees as a test of ability and emotional maturity (being able to sit and do 
work), even if the job itself requires no college level skills. So people go to 
college to avoid service sector and manual work. But not everyone has the 
academic ability or desire for the professional tracks (business, education, 
health) or the sciences/engineering. So they need something, which turns out to 
be these other areas. Yes,<em>some</em> people love Milton, but most humanities 
majors are there because they mildly enjoy the topic and need to get a degree. 
We need a way for people to credential themselves without taking on the massive 
un-payable debt associated with the modern humanities degree.</p>

<h2>grad skool rulz &ndash; finding a research&nbsp;assistant</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p>Viewer mail! With her permission, Valerie from New Hampshire wrote the 
following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m a reader of orgtheory and I enjoy the grad school rulz stuff from 
your blog (I love professional development type things). I have a question to 
pose for a next edition&ndash; how do you find and hire good research 
assistants? I&rsquo;m particularly interested in non-PhD student RAs, but I 
assume there are similar principles. Basically, if you have a resume, writing 
sample, and time to interview, how would identify people who are bright, hard 
working, can finish tasks in a timely manner, have a good nose for research, 
etc? I&rsquo;m finding myself at a loss, since you can&rsquo;t exactly get much 
out of asking, &ldquo;So&hellip; are you hard working?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Good question. Here is what I wrote back:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For undergrads, I use the following rules:&nbsp; They need to have taken a 
course from me and get a B or higher, or they need a reference from another 
prof and a 3.0 GPA or higher.</p> 
<p>The thresholds vary.&nbsp; Then, I usually assess the student. I give them 
some simple task to do. If they do it well, they move on to more ambitious 
things. Otherwise, I phase them out by giving them very easy tasks.</p> 
<p>I find people by talking about RA&rsquo;ships in my courses. I have 
lectures, so many potential recruits. The undergrad coordinator also knows I 
need people. That brings 2-4 people a semester.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Another tactic: I look for students who have done &ldquo;nitty 
gritty&rdquo; work of some type, like working in a biology lab. They know profs 
are looking for hard working people who need boring work done. If they are 
willing to do it again, they&rsquo;re probably good workers.</p>

<h2>useless college&nbsp;majors</h2> 
<p>with 30 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Over at the Marginal Revolution, Alex Tabarrok posted a nice chart. It 
shows that the growth in awarded college degrees has come from people majoring 
outside the sciences and engineering.</p> 
<p>This is important. It shows that we are encouraging people to attend 
college but they are not earning degrees that will make them competitive in the 
labor market. I am not an enemy of humanities but I believe that higher 
education must be carefully managed. It&rsquo;s not a problem if *some* people 
major in fields with poor job prospects. After all, novelists, artists, and 
other creative types improve the world in important ways. We should have 
institutions that support the arts. But it&rsquo;s a big deal when when *lots* 
of people major in areas with poor job prospects. These people take out massive 
loans for skills they will never use.</p> 
<p>Long time readers know that I believe that we have too much college. A lot 
of people simply don&rsquo;t have the academic ability or maturity for college. 
Thus, we shouldn&rsquo;t encourage those people to go. But this chart shows 
that there is a significant number of people who can handle college, but it 
likely won&rsquo;t help them much. Given the skyrocketing costs, we are 
condemning them to decades of student loan servicing when they should be 
leading happier low debt lives.</p>

<h2>the pseudoscience of single-sex&nbsp;schooling</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the name of a new article in the journal <em>Science</em> 
claiming that single sex (SS) schools do not lead to better learning outcomes. 
The authors,Diane Halpern of Claremont and seven others, claim higher scores 
for SS students are results of selection bias and sample censoring:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For example, students at a public middle school in the Southwest United 
States boast higher test scores than most students in their district. But they 
had significantly higher test scores in the year before admission than girls 
who applied but were not admitted, although admission was reported to be a 
lottery, and their subsequent achievement was no better than that of students 
in a coeducational program with similar entry-level score.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In addition, underperforming children in SS schools often transfer out 
prematurely, which inflates final performance outcomes.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>They also claim that there is no evidence that male and female brains 
operate differently with respect to learning.&nbsp; While there are gendered 
differences in brain anatomy, they claim that there is no link to learning.</p> 
<p>My main disagreement disagreement is in their response that SS schooling 
can effectively counter the issue of teachers treating male and female students 
differently. The article switches to the effects of in-class segregation. 
Halpern at al claim, correctly, that separating students prevent students from 
cooperating and increases sex typing (e.g., girls act more feminine).</p> 
<p>But there are two issues. These studies, if I understand them, are about 
separating students into two groups within a class. SS education physically 
separates people into separate classes. Second, I didn&rsquo;t see evidence 
showing that teachers treat female students better in mixed classes. Evidence 
about sex typing doesn&rsquo;t address teacher interaction. Even if mixed 
classes lead to more gender mixing, teachers may still preferentially treat 
males. Maybe not. Perhaps it&rsquo;s in the literature. If so, it should be 
discussed.</p> 
<p>As a higher education researcher, I am familiar with the evidence 
addressing under-represented minorities and their achievement. Generally, 
it&rsquo;s very hard to get under-performing groups to do better. Also, 
it&rsquo;s hard to get experimental evidence but there is observational 
evidence. For example,one often cited study has claimed that Asian American 
benefit from a strong peer counseling network&nbsp; that is non-existent for 
African Americans. I.e., Asian American college students build lots of study 
groups that others don&rsquo;t. This suggests that intensive supplemental work, 
which may be focused on one group, may be effective.</p> 
<p>Overall, I am still not a strong proponent of single sex, or single race, 
education. One should learn to succeed in the world as it is. We should also 
demand that our educators treat all students alike. Unless SS education had 
unambiguously strong effects, we should probably not be doing it.</p>

<h2>northwestern phd&nbsp;students</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>One of the highlights of my visit to Northwestern was a chance to sit in on 
Paul Hirsch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Macro-Organization Behavior&rdquo; doctoral seminar 
(well, and the subsequent dinner pictured below &ndash; sorry, that was the 
best shot we were able to get). &nbsp;Paul&rsquo;s seminar consists of first 
and second year students in the organizations and/or sociology PhD programs. 
&nbsp; The level of discussion was high &ndash; frankly, surprisingly high. 
&nbsp;Fantastic students.</p> 
<p>Beyond the regular discussion for that day (we read Zajac-Westphal ASR, 
Davis et al. ASR, Oliver AMR and Thornton-Ocasio AJS &mdash; important papers), 
Paul asked me to send him some recent work of mine. &nbsp;I was hoping we would 
get into some issues related to performativity and markets &ndash; but Paul had 
the students read about the&nbsp;Jepperson and Meyer debate. &nbsp;The classic 
agency v structure (or, actor v non-actor) debate was a good fit for the 
seminar. &nbsp;The discussion was very lively. &nbsp;We had a great discussion 
about whether the two sides simply represent extremes, about the history of 
methodological debates like this (going back to the German Historical School, 
Weber etc), the practical implications of these debates for understanding 
social phenomena, questions of &ldquo;pushing your cookie&rdquo; versus 
pluralism, etc, etc. &nbsp;Great discussion.</p> 
<p>As a quick side comment &ndash; what is very cool about Northwestern is 
that everything seems to scream &ldquo;inter-disciplinarity&rdquo; of some 
sort. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;The orgs and soc people are extremely well linked, 
attend each other&rsquo;s seminars etc, micro and macro folks work together 
(e.g., Brayden has a recent piece with the notorious Adam G in a&nbsp;psych 
outlet), you&rsquo;ve orgs folks like Jeannette Colyvas at the Ed 
School,&nbsp;and you&rsquo;ve got fascinating interdisciplinary centers like 
the one Brian Uzzi&nbsp;co-directs (Nico).</p> 
<p>So, bottom line &ndash; if you are considering an orgs phd (I know we have 
a few readers in this boat), then Northwestern better be at the top of your 
list. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think you can go wrong there &ndash; fantastic 
scholars and an interdisciplinary, collaborative environment. &nbsp;Two 
orgtheory thumbs up.</p> 
<p>The photo was taken at the restaurant&nbsp;Prairie Moon. &nbsp;(Again, 
sorry about the photo quality &ndash; it was the best shot we got, even with my 
all-powerful 4s.)</p>

<h2>social theory is hard to&nbsp;teach</h2> 
<p>with 9 comments</p> 
<p><em>Previously on orgtheory: The social theory poll/goals of the social 
theory course</em></p> 
<p>This week, I want to talk about why social theory is hard to teach. Among 
sociology courses, it&rsquo;s probably the most demanding course, along with 
statistics and intro. Statistics is hard because sociology majors have poor 
math skills. The introductory sociology course is hard because there is no 
standard and you get a wide range of students, from scared freshmen to 
apathetic sixth year seniors.</p> 
<p>Social theory is hard to teach for different reasons.&nbsp;First, many 
students are attracted to the topics of sociology (e.g., race) not the general 
idea of testing social theories. Thus, they simply lack the general language of 
social science. They don&rsquo;t think in terms of variables, processes, and 
hypotheses. They think about a jumble of disconnected facts. Furthermore, lower 
division topics courses (e.g., crime or gender) rarely cast their topic in 
terms of general sociological arguments.</p> 
<p>Second, social theory often comes at the end of the sociology major and is 
not integrated with the rest of the curriculum. Indiana, like many schools, 
allows students to postpone theory as long as they want. It is not considered a 
prequisite for many courses nor do programs require it as an entry point of the 
major. As one commenter noted, departments are scared of losing students. The 
result is that you get people who are exposed to theory as the last thing they 
do before graduation. They spend their whole career in topics courses that do 
not emphasize the basics of theory, the casting empirical topics as evidence 
for broader concepts.&nbsp;The implied message is that this course is hard and 
not terribly relevant. Not surprisingly, they are often puzzled about the goal 
of the course when they finally get to it.</p> 
<p>Third, social theory is taught at an intellectual level that towers above 
most other sociology courses. To understand, say Weber&rsquo;s, writings, you 
need to know history, have a broad vocabulary, and be able to read lengthy and 
complex sentences. The typical intro course often relies on streamlined 
textbooks. Lower division topics courses are often grounded in material that is 
fairly intuitive for most people. We shouldn&rsquo;t be shocked when students 
just can&rsquo;t deal with these books. It&rsquo;s far above what we normally 
ask of them.</p> 
<p>It is for these reasons that I think sociology should be required upon 
entry to the sociology major. We need to raise the reading level of majors and 
send a consistent message that sociology is not a bunch of topics, it&rsquo;s a 
school of thought that isn&rsquo;t different from any other science that 
compares theory with data.</p>

<h2>organization design&nbsp;bleg</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>Is organizational design being taught anywhere anymore?&nbsp; I teach an 
MBA organization theory class so we have a small section dedicated to org 
design.&nbsp; But are there full-fledged org design classes out there?&nbsp; 
And, if so, what materials are used?</p> 
<p>In my MBA organization theory class I have used the following org 
design-related materials: Nitin Nohria&rsquo;s succinctNote on Organization 
Structure along with his Appex case, the Oticon case (with Nicolai&rsquo;s 
excellent<em>Organization Science</em> piece on Oticon as extra 
reading),&nbsp;and then miscellaneous readings that touch on issues such as 
legitimacy and structure (so, for example, we&rsquo;ve read Meyer &amp; Rowan, 
also an old Mintzberg<em>Management Science</em> piece) as well as some 
readings related to self-organization.&nbsp; A couple times I have also used the
Hofstede cultural relativity of organizational practices piece.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to increase the amount of coverage I give to 
organizational design.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in touch with some of our graduates and 
structure is a matter that they constantly wrestle with.&nbsp; What other 
resources would you recommend for this audience?&nbsp; I really quite like Rich 
Burton et al&rsquo;s slim book<em> Organization Design: A Step-by-Step Approach
</em> (Cambridge) and a few years ago I also talked to him about the 
design/structure-related simulation software that he makes available &ndash; 
I&rsquo;m thinking about incorporating parts of the book.</p> 
<p>If there are org design folks anywhere out there &ndash; I would be eager 
to hear what materials you have successfully utilized.</p> 
<p>UPDATE: hadn&rsquo;t been there for some time but just noted that the 
teachOMT wiki has some nice org design related materials (and, hey, their 
design looks very familiar).</p>

<h2>wise not to turn your back on &lsquo;em &hellip; economists, that&nbsp;is
</h2> 
<p>with 7 comments</p> 
<p>Looking back on it, getting an MBA at the University of Chicago (1981) is 
really what led me to academia. Back then, course readings were 30-40 academic 
journal articles. Rarely did a textbook accompany a class. As students, we knew 
we were there to learn the latest-and-greatest academic thinking. In our view, 
courses based upon some textbook anybody could get at their student bookstore 
for $50 had to be worth little more than, well, $50. Forget about classes 
taught by the grey-hairs (you know, classes in which some big-shot ex-executive 
sits around and regales students with war stories) &mdash; total waste of time, 
in our view. No, we wanted the meaty stuff. The stuff that wouldn&rsquo;t be 
&ldquo;best-practices&rdquo; for another 10 years. Commercializing that 
knowledge, yeah, that&rsquo;s where the money was.</p> 
<p>So, I specialized in Finance (what else?) and launched into an exciting 
decade+ of business practice. At some point, I started consulting and, at some 
point after that, I was asked to work on a strategy project. I knew nothing 
about strategy at the time &mdash; BUT! &mdash; I knew how to read academic 
journals. No problem. Off to the library to read the pink strategy journal! Up 
to speed and 10 years ahead of practice in a few sittings.&nbsp;That b-school 
training was truly awesome. (In case you are wondering, btw, years later when I 
was a rookie PhD, I interviewed at Chicago. My old Micro prof, Sam Peltzman, 
took me to dinner. When I asked him what journal articles he was putting in his 
MBA course, he did a spit-take and said, &ldquo;Wall Street Journal 
articles.&rdquo; More on this later.)</p> 
<p>I guess it would be fair to say that I found the strategy literature sadly 
wanting in comparison to the precision and mathematical sophistication I was 
used to in the Finance literature (mind you, this was as a<em>practitioner</em>
). My reaction was: big opportunity here. This was the 90s and, for those who 
are not aware of it, the methodological advances in economics were really 
expanding at that time: game theoretic learning, evolutionary economics, 
behavioral economics, computational methods &hellip; cool technological 
approaches that held some promise in tackling the complexities inherent in the 
strategy problem domain. Off I went to get a math econ degree and I&rsquo;ve 
never looked back with any regrets. (I do look back and marvel at the level of 
hubris that propelled me on my way &mdash; though, without it, where would any 
of us be in this academic hustle?)</p> 
<p>Over time, outside of trying to stay up on promising methodological 
developments, I became less attentive to what people were doing in economics. 
Early-on, I tried to get my IO friends interested in the issues that so 
animated my own research. Typically, 3 minutes into describing something I was 
working on to a respected IO colleague, I could see the eyes glaze over and 
hear the responses go on autopilot. I really was a strategy guy and, clearly, 
the strategy literature was where my career would rise or fall. When asked, I 
explained it in this way, &ldquo;The central question in strategy is who gets 
what, why and for how long. IO economists, IO being in many ways a mirror 
field, are interested in how the most value gets created. The dichotomy is one 
between distributional vs. efficiency issues. We want to tell Apple how to make 
more profit. They want to tell the FTC how to increase social welfare.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>This is not to say there weren&rsquo;t always great economists in the 
bi-curious category. Of course there were. But, they were not the majority and 
I was smugly comfortable in my belief that, regardless of how frustratingly 
slow progress in strategy was, the field had little to worry about from 
economics. In fact, just as recently as last year, I had this discussion with 
one of my dearest colleagues, Jan Rivkin. &nbsp;I was somewhat surprised when 
he, in so many words, told me I was full of it. I felt sorry (for him) that I 
couldn&rsquo;t bring him around in that discussion. Eventually, though, I knew 
I would win him over.</p> 
<p>That was until about a month ago. That was about a time the paper by Chad 
Syverson (2011) started making the rounds. Entitled, &ldquo;What Determines 
Productivity?&rdquo; it is a wide-ranging survey paper that collects and 
organizes work in economics on persistent differences in firm productivity 
levels. Almost all the papers are from 2000 on. I found the quantity and 
quality of work cited, frankly, jaw-dropping. Now, those who have followed the 
narrative to this point will say, &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s work on<em>
productivity</em> &mdash; that means the interest is still all about 
efficiency!&rdquo; True. But, here&rsquo;s the catch: &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; 
in this work is typically measured as Revenue/Cost. Take the numerator and 
subtract the denominator and &mdash; PRESTO &mdash; you have the object of 
focus in strategy.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m still digesting this. It could be good news. After all, I&rsquo;d 
love to have more outlets for my work. On the other hand, young scholars like 
Syverson are smart &hellip; and teched-up &hellip; and full of youthful energy. 
What I<em>can</em> say is that the bar for strategy research has stealthily 
gone up over last decade.</p>

<h2>the back-to-school/afterschool &ldquo;art&nbsp;world&rdquo;</h2> 
<p>with 5 comments</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re a parent you&rsquo;ve likely spent a lot of time lately 
preparing for the start of the school year.&nbsp; Pictures on the front porch 
of the house with child in first-day-of-school attire (posted to Facebook, of 
course)? Check. School supplies purchased featuring some sort of 
Disney/Nickelodeon character? Double Check. Signed child up for a plethora of 
enrichment afterschool activities after being deluged with ads and then feeling 
guilty because every other child your child&rsquo;s age seems to be enrolled? 
Check Plus.</p> 
<p>Today it&rsquo;s not just classroom instruction that creates so much 
cultural and social capital in childhood.&nbsp; The out-of-school hours are a 
huge source of capital-building as well (what I call &ldquo;competitive kid 
capital&rdquo; in my work on elementary school-age kids involved in the 
competitive afterschool activities of chess, dance, and soccer).&nbsp; And 
these afterschool hours are not only the source of capital for kids, they are 
also the source of very real economic capital for many adults.&nbsp; For many 
teachers and coaches these afterschool activities are the basis of their 
livelihoods.&nbsp; In particular, they make a living by both creating 
competitive kid capital<em>and</em> sustaining a base of families who believe 
that kid capital is essential to future success.</p> 
<p>Behind the culturally celebrated veil of competition then is an elaborate 
infrastructure and industry that organizes, supports, and promotes organized 
children&rsquo;s activities, and in turn shapes the daily lives of many 
American families.&nbsp; There is a world of childhood activities organized to 
profit from parents who are concerned about their children&rsquo;s 
futures.&nbsp; Different sets of individuals, organizations, and businesses 
play a role in producing child competitors and winners, just as it takes an 
&ldquo;art world&rdquo; to create an artist or a piece of art (a la Becker).</p>
<p>We should think of those who run organizations related to children&rsquo;s 
afterschool activities as entrepreneurs (note that they are usually part of the 
formal economy, but can be part of the informal economy as well).&nbsp; These 
entrepreneurs are surrounded by constellations of other entrepreneurs who 
charge for additional services&mdash;like those who sell clothing and shoes 
needed to participate in an activity, or publish magazines and books about the 
activities.&nbsp; I was particularly struck by this when I attended a State 
Soccer Expo and saw vendors selling products I had not previously considered 
vital to the travel soccer enterprise. For example, there was a booth for a 
company that sold the paint used to paint the lines on soccer fields. Another 
booth featured a business specializing in cookies, popcorn, and other snacks, 
which can then be sold by teams, at a marked up price, as part of fundraising 
efforts.&nbsp; Another sold special headbands meant to help prevent 
concussions.&nbsp; Clearly, such products are only sometimes necessary.&nbsp; 
But producers, who need to make money, advertise that the products will make 
participation more convenient, or improve a child&rsquo;s performance, thus 
making a purchase &ldquo;required.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other products, like the 
headbands, are successful by preying on parental concerns about their 
children&rsquo;s safety.</p> 
<p>Because parents are willing to invest a lot of money in these activities, 
there is a lot of money to be made.&nbsp; Profits are high because prices are 
high; teachers and coaches can charge a lot since there are often not many 
competitors in their areas of expertise, which would help keep prices 
down.&nbsp; While some parents express discomfort that some adults are 
&ldquo;making a living off of&rdquo; their children (childhood is supposed to 
be a sacred time, after all), they still pay up for fear of their child being 
&ldquo;left behind.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Notably, the funeral industry and some industries associated with children 
(like preschool) are regulated in an attempt to limit exploitation of a 
vulnerable population.&nbsp; What is problematic is that children&rsquo;s 
after-school activities have become so commodified, with little to no 
regulation of their practices.&nbsp; How much are you willing to spend on the 
&ldquo;art world&rdquo; surrounding your child&rsquo;s afterschool life?</p>

<h2>conservatives and their college&nbsp;fantasies</h2> 
<p>with 8 comments</p> 
<p>Conservative think that modern colleges are bastions on unfettered 
communism. Now, there is an important element of truth. As surveys have shown, 
professors tend to be politically liberal, much more than the rest of the 
population. The conservative critics are also correct in that many branches of 
the humanities have taken a very liberal turn in the last fifty years.</p> 
<p>However, conservative critics are wrong in thinking that classic western 
culture&nbsp; has been run out of town. Consider the post calledWhat I Thought, 
at Age 16, Academia was Supposed to Be by David Henderson. He praises Tim 
Rollins for running a company that offers courses on the Western canon. 
I&rsquo;ve got no beef with that. It&rsquo;s great when a man can profit by 
teaching great literature. But then, Henderson approvingly quotes Heather 
MacDonald&rsquo;s article on Rollins and his company. For example:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>So totalitarian is the contemporary university that professors have written 
to Rollins complaining that his courses are too canonical in content and do not 
include enough of the requisite &ldquo;silenced&rdquo; voices.Read the rest of

<h2>conservatives in the academy: it&rsquo;s not discrimination, it&rsquo;s 
selection &ndash; for 103rd&nbsp;time</h2> 
<p>with 25 comments</p> 
<p>Many conservative critics of the academy believe that liberals dominate 
because of anti-conservative discrimination. While there are likely some cases 
of that, the evidence was always weak for discrimination as a general 
explanation. For example, liberals dominate in fields that are not political, 
like math. In technical fields, people are recruited from all over the world. 
I&rsquo;d be surprised if the engineering professor knew the politics of the 
new guy from Kazakhstan, unless he made a big deal out of it.</p> 
<p>My view, as I&rsquo;ve stated before on this blog, is simply that 
there&rsquo;s a massive self-selection process at work. Being conservative is 
probably correlated with certain attitudes toward work, such a desire for high 
compensation, that are hard to satisfy in the academy. There are also field 
specific self-selection effects. Sociology for example, studies all kinds of 
deviant behavior and the faculty tend to skew liberal, not the sort of thing 
that attracts conservatives.</p> 
<p>It turns out that Neil Gross, Jeremy Freese and Ethan Fosse have a series 
of papers testing the self-selection hypothesis.&nbsp; And surprise, the 
evidence points toward self-selection. A working paper called &ldquo;POLITICAL 
LIBERALISM AND GRADUATE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE: A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS&rdquo; 
reports the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This paper analyzes longitudinal data to evaluate three claims that are key
<br> to a recently developed theory of professorial politics. The theory 
explains the liberalism of the American professoriate as a function of 
reputation-based self-selection: because academia has a reputation for 
liberalism, liberals are more likely to pursue graduate degrees and academic 
careers. We examine whether in fact young Americans who identify as liberal are 
more likely to enroll in graduate programs with the intention of completing a 
doctorate; the proposition that such a tendency cannot be explained away by 
variables unrelated to occupational reputation; and the claim, also made by the 
theory,<br>
 that exposure to many years of higher education is not a major 
cause of the liberalism of graduate students. We find support for all three 
claims, with ambiguity only on the question of whether the greater propensity 
of those on the left to attend graduate school results from personality 
differences.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This squares with my experience teaching sociology undergraduates. I often 
reach out to high achieving undergraduates to sign up for the sociology major 
or senior level courses, regardless of what I think their political attitudes 
may be. Among students who have exhibited conservative opinions, getting them 
into upper level sociology is like pulling teeth. Many have already made a 
choice to major in other topics.</p> 
<p>For conservative critics of the academy, I have a simple message based on 
my reading of this research paper and others. Yes, being on the opposite side 
of things can be tough, but the evidence shows that conservatives, on the 
average, aren&rsquo;t even trying to make careers in the academy. So if you 
really want the academy to take your ideas seriously, invest the effort at 
making a difference. My sense is that there&rsquo;s a large opportunity 
that&rsquo;s been passed on.</p>

<h2>why stop at cutting financial aid for for-profit colleges? why not cut 
financial aid to&nbsp;non-profits?</h2> 
<p>with 12 comments</p> 
<p>The NY Times has a forum on a new regulation that would reduce financial 
aid to for-profit entities that havelow student loan repayment rates:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Under a rule announced June 1, the Department of Education will cut off 
federal financial aid for any for-profit program if its graduates have a lot of
student loan debt and low repayment rates. This effort to require the programs 
to yield &ldquo;gainful employment&rdquo; has angered private colleges as well 
as some education advocates who say minority students will be 
disproportionately harmed if the programs lose their eligibility for federal 
aid.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of higher education that won&rsquo;t get you a job 
&ndash; arts, philosophy, and do so forth. Unless an institution is engaged in 
fraud, there&rsquo;s little reason to pick specifically on for-profit 
institutions. We should really be asking tough questions about higher education 
finances in general. Maybe we should have rules barring financial aid for 
degrees that have horrible job prospects(see here). My goal isn&rsquo;t to 
discourage able and committed people from college. Instead, I would like to see 
some sort of cost-benefit analysis added to the way that we charge people for 
education.</p>

<h2>the value of your college&nbsp;major</h2> 
<p>with 5 comments</p> 
<p>The American Community Survey has great data on college major, employment, 
and income. A research group&nbsp;at Georgetown has analyzed this data to show 
correlations between college major and income. Let&rsquo;s get straight to it:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Math and computer science (as a group) tops it off at $98k.</li> 
<li>Studio art, some esoteric types of engineering, and some kinds of youth 
counseling have the lowest incomes and high unemployment.</li> 
<li>Among the social sciences, econ is on top ($70k) while soc is at the 
bottom ($45k).</li> </ul> 
<p>The report by Jeffrey Carneval, Joeff Strohl, and Michelle Melton,&nbsp; is 
here&nbsp;(it&rsquo;s 182 pages &ndash; so a slow download). Some 
correlations&nbsp;are real supply and demand. Nuclear engineering, which has 
very high unemployment, reflects a shrinking industry. Art is well&hellip; art. 
There&rsquo;s selection effects as well. Having taken a math major myself, I 
can attest that topology isn&rsquo;t useful in the labor market, but it 
probably acts as strong signal. There are also personality selection effects. 
Most sociology majors could earn more money, but they insist on service 
oriented jobs, like teaching and social work, that suprress their wages.</p>

<h2>questioning the higher education&nbsp;bubble</h2> 
<p>with 23 comments</p> 
<p>I was recently quoted in the Huffington Post in a story about Thiel&rsquo;s 
claim that higher education is a bubble. I was quoted as one of the skeptics. 
Later that day,Thomas Gorkey, who teaches at Syracuse, read the article and 
wrote, I said that higher education wasn&rsquo;t a bubble in the normal sense 
of the word because education is not a commodity that you can trade:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me, but I&rsquo;d love for you to convince 
me that I&rsquo;m wrong! To me it seems that students (and mainly parents) do 
in fact treat college as a tradable commodity. They trade thousands of dollars 
(that they don&rsquo;t have) for an education that is supposed to land them a 
job that pays even more than what their education cost.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I think this deserves a response. In my response, I relied on a distinction 
made by the economist Gary Becker: physical capital vs. human capital. Physical 
capital is some physical object that allows you to produce more goods and 
services for sale on the market. Human capital is the skill that someone has 
that allows them to gain income from the market. Becker&rsquo;s argument was 
that education resulted in higher income because schools trained people in 
various skills and thus create human capital.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get back to the higher education bubble. When people say 
&ldquo;bubble,&rdquo; they usually mean &ldquo;an unsustainable rise in 
prices,&rdquo; which is often, but not always, due to speculation. The reason 
that prices have to eventually go down is that the underlying value 
hasn&rsquo;t risen. The gap, as I mentioned, is often attributed to 
speculation. People consistently buy something hoping to quickly sell it off.
</p> 
<p>Notice that in this description of a bubble, some commodity is circulated 
and there&rsquo;s a consistent error that pushes the price up and up each time 
the commodity changes hands. This describes the housing bubble well. People 
(including banks) started believing that housing prices would just go up and 
up, which then justified all kinds of crazy loans. However, college education 
is a form of human capital. The stuff you learned can&rsquo;t be transferred to 
another person, no matter how much they pay. So it can&rsquo;t be a bubble, at 
least they way most people talk about bubbles.</p> 
<p>Thus, something else is happening in higher education. For a certain 
segment of the market, there is a huge over investment in human capital. As in 
some bubbles, people are making some sort of gross over estimation of how much 
some economic resource is worth. But the difference is that there&rsquo;s no 
Ponzi scheme since you can&rsquo;t sell or transfer your college degree to 
someone else for an even higher price. Human capital simply can&rsquo;t be 
transferred. I agree with Thiel that something is very much wrong in higher 
education, but it&rsquo;s not quite analogous to the housing or dot-com bubbles.
</p> 
<p>Let me end with a few hypotheses about why some people &ndash; mainly 
middle class people sending their kids to private colleges &ndash; are paying 
way to much for college. (a) Can&rsquo;t say no. (b) They simply don&rsquo;t 
understand that their kids won&rsquo;t make the income to cover the loan. (c) 
Emulation of the wealthy. (d) Consumption good &ndash; they simply value the 
four years a lot. (e) Myopic preferences &ndash; people seriously underestimate 
long term costs.</p>

<h2>an inconvenient truth about GRE&nbsp;scores</h2> 
<p>with 87 comments</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of skepticism about GRE&rsquo;s and their role in 
graduate admissions.&nbsp; The folk wisdom seems to be that GRE&rsquo;s 
aren&rsquo;t terribly useful. It turns out that there is actually extensive 
research investigating whether GRE scores actually do predict performance in 
graduate school. Check out this 2001 article from Psychological Bulletin. 
It&rsquo;s called&ldquo;A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of the Predictive 
Validity of the Graduate Record Examinations: Implications for Graduate Student 
Selection and Performance.&rdquo;Here&rsquo;s the abstract:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This meta-analysis examined the validity of the Graduate Record 
Examinations (GRE) and undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) as predictors 
of graduate school performance. The study included samples from multiple 
disciplines, considered different criterion measures, and corrected for 
statistical artifacts. Data from 1,753 independent samples were included in the 
meta-analysis, yielding 6,589 correlations for 8 different criteria and 82,659 
graduate students. The results indicated that the GRE and UGPA are 
generalizably valid predictors of graduate grade point average, Ist-year 
graduate grade point average, comprehensive examination scores, publication 
citation counts, and faculty ratings. GRE correlations with degree attainment 
and research productivity were consistently positive; however, some lower 90% 
credibility intervals included 0. Subject Tests tended to be better predictors 
than the Verbal, Quantitative, and Analytical tests.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Wow. GRE&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t perfect, but they sure seem to do the job. 
With respect to graduate admissions, this basically says &ldquo;go with GRE 
scores and grades unless there is strong credible signalling.&rdquo; Any other 
interpretations? Any GRE skeptics willing to defend their position?</p>

<h2>the failure of *public* higher&nbsp;education</h2> 
<p>with 4 comments</p> 
<p>You should definitely read olderwoman&rsquo;s lengthy discussion of the 
University of Wisconsin at the Scatterplot blog. The issue is separating out 
Madison as an independent &ldquo;public authority,&rdquo; which, if I 
understand correctly, gives it this sort of independent status. There is one 
passage in o.w.&rsquo;s post that I want to discuss at length:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>One core value question is whether you support the idea of an elite 
research institution or not. Should there be major public research institutions 
at all? And if so, what does it take to maintain them? Can an elite research 
university survive with an egalitarian ethos in the face of competition from 
the unapologetic elitist private institutions?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s my response. Rather than argue at the level of values, 
let&rsquo;s look at the historical record. First, public research institutions 
have done remarkably well in the competition. The leading flagships &ndash; 
Berkeley, Ann Arbor, Michigan, etc. &ndash; have research records comparable to 
elite privates. In some fields, like engineering, they surpass nearly all 
private institutions (except maybe MIT or Cal Tech). Second, the public 
research school has done a good job educating lots of people,myself included. 
They&rsquo;ve done at reasonable price (until recently) and with a world class 
faculty.</p> 
<p>So why did I title this post &ldquo;the failure of public higher 
education?&rdquo; Well, the empirical record shows that the public isn&rsquo;t 
terribly interested in this record. Sure, in polls, people may talk about the 
importance of education, but in state budgets, the message is clear. Higher 
education is second fiddle.</p> 
<p>This is not a case of a few recent Republican legislatures targeting 
liberal egg heads for budget cuts. Rather, there has been a 40 year decline in 
the relative contribution by state legislatures to public university budgets. 
After the boom in public colleges in the 1960s, there began a slow whittling 
away of public support as legislatures gave more and more money to other budget 
items such as K-12 education, police, prisons, and public sector employee 
compensation. These may, or may not, be defensible choices, but the bottom line 
is the same &ndash; reduced support for public universities.</p> 
<p>The consequence is a structural transformation of the leading public 
universities.As I wrote a few weeks ago, the leading state schools aren&rsquo;t 
really &ldquo;state&rdquo; schools. They are more like schools that get an 
annual state grant. They&rsquo;ve succeeded in teaching and research, but 
they&rsquo;ve failed in maintaining their relationship to the state.</p> 
<p>Let me finish with a more constructive comment. o.w. wrote that some people 
focused on tuition in a world without public research institutions. Perhaps a 
&ldquo;free&rdquo; Wisconsin would charge Harvard rates. I think there is a 
middle way. The state has the power to charter schools, give them grants, and 
license their brand name (e.g., the University of State X). In exchange for 
adopting a quasi-private stance and retaining these privileges, state 
universities would be required to fund raise and establish an endowment that is 
only for in-state students. The endowment would be earmarked for low income 
in-state students and the university would be required to admit a certain 
proportion of in state students. That way, the state university could be free 
from state regulations while maintaining its mission to serve the local 
population.</p>
