<h1>Why should a child learn a foreign language?</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
 Children are more susceptible to foreign sounds than adults and 
adolescents, making them more capable of identifying and forming new 
sounds.&nbsp; Therefore, they tend to be more successful in the pronunciation 
of a new language.</p> 
<p>Children are able to gain a better communicative fluency if they are 
exposed to a foreign language for a long period of time.<br>
 Students of 
foreign language&nbsp;benefit academically in many ways as&nbsp;neural pathways 
are enhanced, supporting them in&nbsp;many other academic learning&nbsp;tasks.
<br> </p> 
<p>The&nbsp;early years of childhood are the most significant years in which a 
development of attitudes toward different cultures is formed.<br>
 Children who 
study foreign languages and cultures gain a better understanding of the world 
and thus have greater potential in international and intercultural 
communication.<br>
</p> 
<p>Learning foreign languages allows children to improve their self concept 
and sense of accomplishment during school.<br>
Why Chinese for Children?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Starting Chinese studies at an early age can enable children to be more 
successful with the four tones in Chinese pronunciation, which is crucial for 
communication.</li> 
<li>A long sequence of training is required for achieving a&nbsp; high level 
of proficiency since Chinese is listed by the Foreign Service Institute as a 
Group IV language.&nbsp; This means that learning Chinese takes 2.5 to 3 times 
the time necessary to gain the same level of proficiency as a Group 1 language 
such as French, German or Spanish.&nbsp; *<strong>The Mandarin Bilingual 
program allows children to receive the appropriate amount of time needed to 
gain a high level of proficiency</strong>. </li> 
<li>Experts believe that early exposure to an idea or experience that is 
&quot;foreign&quot; can become the driving force for cognitive 
development.&nbsp; Chinese is a member of the Sino-Tibetan language 
family.&nbsp; It is completely unrelated to the Indo-European language family, 
to which English and most other European languages belong.&nbsp; Therefore, an 
early exposure to Chinese will enhance a child's menatal flexibility, 
creativity, divergent thinking and complex thinking skills.</li> 
<li>Writing Chinese characters helps children acquire fine motor skills since 
character writing requires visual-hand coordination and awareness of proportion.
</li> 
<li>Although Chinese is listed as a Group IV language, its grammar at 
the&nbsp;very basic level is quite simple for children to learn.&nbsp; Unlike 
Western languages, Chinese characters do not have changes with word endings for 
gender, case, number, person or tense.&nbsp; The initial stage of Chiense 
language learning requires imitation and repetition, both of which children 
enjoy doing, particularly when incorporated into the context of games, rhymes, 
songs and skits.</li> 
<li>Early exposure to the Chinese language and culture will provide children 
with an opportunity to explore lifestyles, values and beliefs that are very 
different from our own.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope the understanding they gain will be 
of great significance to the harmony&nbsp;of our world.</li> 
<li>In the era of global communication, it is important to be able to 
negotiate, trade and exchange ideas in foreign languages with appropriate 
attention to cultural differences.&nbsp; Children will benefit from their early 
experiences with Chinese studies as they grow up in an increasingly global and 
multicultural society.</li> 
<li>Since China has maintained one of the fastest growing economies in the 
world for over twenty years, studying Chinese at an early age can further a 
child's potential for a future career in international trade and intercultural 
exchange.</li> </ul>
