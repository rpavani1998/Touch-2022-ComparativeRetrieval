<b>Center for Cultural 
Interchange</b> 
<blockquote> We are looking for qualified families that might be interested in 
cultural exchange and volunteering to host a high school exchange student. 
Volunteer host families provide the meals for the exchange student and a place 
to stay (a student must have his or her own bed in either a separate room or in 
a shared room with a host sibling of similar age and same gender). Students 
have their own spending money to cover personal expenses and have accident and 
health insurance through the program. Host families are not compensated for 
hosting a high school exchange student per U.S. Department of State 
regulations. However, families are eligible for a modest tax deduction for each 
month they host a student.
<p> We are currently seeking host families for several 15-18 year old boys and 
girls from countries such as Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Taiwan, Vietnam, 
Hungary, Poland, Colombia, Brazil, and China among many others. I will be more 
than happy to forward you bios, of some of the students we are seeking host 
families for, to review. We do our best to match students with host families 
based on similar hobbies and interests in order to ease the student's 
transition into U.S. family life and culture.</p>

<b>Creative Bridges for Language Learning</b> 
<blockquote> The performing arts are wonderful instruments for language 
instruction because they incorporate different learning styles and intelligence 
types engaging the whole person in verbal and nonverbal multi-sensory ways of 
self-expression and communication. Students become active, self- motivated 
constructors of meaning and therefore life long learners. By providing an 
alternative audio, visual and kinesthetic symbol system; the performing arts 
can serve as an important resource of communication. It offers another 
vocabulary that the students can use to express their ideas, feelings and 
concepts. The active involvement of mind and body helps students to grasp an 
abstract concept more effectively than if they were simply reading about it in 
a textbook.

<blockquote> Say hola to the future of foreign language learning on the web. 
Mango Languages offers free foreign language lessons in a dozen languages at 
www.mangolanguages.com.
<p> A new concept, mangolanguages.com has married the teaching abilities of 
linguistic teachers from around the world with the latest software 
technologies, providing users with an easy to access way to learn a foreign 
language online at their own pace.</p> 
<p> Unlike other language acquisition products, mangolanguages.com is unique 
because it features a one-of-a-kind comprehensive teaching approach that 
actively engages audio and visual cues to assist users in language acquisition.
</p> 
<p> Students learn vocabulary and grammar by engaging in real and meaningful 
conversations that are broken down line by line, word for word. Phrases and 
sentences are spelled out in both the language the student is trying to learn 
and in English. For the two ESL courses, the opposite applies in that phrases 
and sentences are spelled out in the student&rsquo;s native language (either 
Spanish or Polish) and also in English. The words that make up the phrases and 
sentences are color-coded so the user understands how each word translates. The 
user can also click on each word to hear the pronunciation or click a button to 
hear the whole sentence spoken by a native speaker at a rapid conversational 
pace. The inaugural launch of mangolanguages.com features 100 lessons in nearly 
a dozen languages, including: Spanish, English for Spanish and Polish speakers, 
French, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, 
Japanese and Greek.</p> 
<p> By early 2008, Mango Languages plans to launch the second version of the 
site which will further refine and polish the original language lessons, and 
add new lessons in Hebrew, Arabic, Korean, Polish, Vietnamese, Thai, Cantonese 
Chinese, Irish Gaelic, Farsi, Hindi, Turkish and Ukrainian.</p> 
<p> The site is free and is a great resource for students. Log on to check it 
out at mangolanguages.com</p>

at their own pace.</p> 
<p> Unlike other language acquisition products, mangolanguages.com is unique 
because it features a one-of-a-kind comprehensive teaching approach that 
actively engages audio and visual cues to assist users in language acquisition.
</p> 
<p> Students learn vocabulary and grammar by engaging in real and meaningful 
conversations that are broken down line by line, word for word. Phrases and 
sentences are spelled out in both the language the student is trying to learn 
and in English. For the two ESL courses, the opposite applies in that phrases 
and sentences are spelled out in the student&rsquo;s native language (either 
Spanish or Polish) and also in English. The words that make up the phrases and 
sentences are color-coded so the user understands how each word translates. The 
user can also click on each word to hear the pronunciation or click a button to 
hear the whole sentence spoken by a native speaker at a rapid conversational 
pace.</p>
