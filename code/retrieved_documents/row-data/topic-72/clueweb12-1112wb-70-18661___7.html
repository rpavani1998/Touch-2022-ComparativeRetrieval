<h3>Why Language Software Sucks</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>Now that I have your attention let me explain what I mean. There are many 
programs and gimmicks out there that claim to have the magic answer to 
languages. Unfortunately it doesnt exist, at least not yet. So let me list a 
few reasons why Language Software and Programs are horrible.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Blind Memorization</strong>: Most programs have you memorizing 
tons of vocabulary without teaching you how to use it. Its like giving you oil 
paints without teaching you the art of painting. Yes, you need vocabulary but 
computers are not yet able to create real life speaking situations that a human 
teacher can. You have to speak with natives in order to learn how and when to 
use certain words</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Predictable</strong>: All of these programs are predictable and 
give you the same questions and answers every time. If you try to speak with 
someone and they dont ask or answer the way you have memorized you are up a 
creek. Humans are not predictable therefore you need to learn languages in a 
manner that will prepare you for spontaneous situations. Practicing and 
building your comfort level, confidence, and intuitive understanding will you 
gain the agility of a native speaker.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Out Dated</strong>: These programs take years to develop and 
after being on the market for a couple of years they are no longer relevant to 
todays vocabulary and subjects. To overcome this you must read current 
materials in the language, like newspapers, and speak to natives.</p> 
<p>4. <strong>You Dont Advance</strong>: You do learn new words and concepts 
but your ability to use them in an actual conversation does not change. You do 
increase the depth of your knowledge but not your skill. This can only be done 
by seeking out opportunities to use your new found understanding.</p> 
<p>After making my point I would like to say that if you have realistic 
expectations of your language software it can be helpful, but it will only 
teach you the basics. These programs are good at what they do, but are not the 
answer to learning to speak a language fluently. Language learning is a life 
long commitment that will take a combination of different learning tools and 
efforts to achieve your goals.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg - StumbleUpon -

<h3>Learning Languages Naturally part 2</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that you can apply this type of learning to any exercise or 
activity that you do. Make sure that you keep it simple, observe, and practice 
like a kid does while growing up, Trial and Error. Dont be afraid to make 
mistakes and ask a lot of questions. Why Why Why Why? * for all of you who have 
kids or was one of these kids youll get the joke.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Attend a Cultural Activity</strong> Kids are always with their 
families and their families are the ones that teach them to speak their 
language. So find local cultural activities and try and attend one or two a 
month.</p> 
<p>Benefits: Observe and mimic natives, interact and speak with native 
speakers, feel the rhythm of the language, and see the mannerisms of natives 
while they speak. Just like a kid would with their family.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Watch TV</strong> Depending on when you were born you watched 
more or less TV as a kid. No matter what your opinion is on TV watching it can 
be an amazing tool for learning a foreign language. So rent or watch: Cartoons, 
Kids programs, Movies, and TV shows. Now depending on your level you can choose 
more advanced programming but Kids programs are a great way to learn a foreign 
language because they follow the always popular K.I.S.S. method. Keep It Simple 
Stupid.</p> 
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Learning effective communication skills at their 
most basic level, Improving your listening ability, feeling the sentence 
structure and rhythm.</p>

<h3>Be A Kid Again! Learn Languages Naturally</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>When learning a foreign language you need to learn the language like you 
learned your native language. If you look at other cultures and languages you 
recognize that everyone that is born into them has been able to learn their 
language. So why cant you? You can, languages are only foreign because we do 
not use them. So in order to learn a new language we need to clean or minds of 
all the things we think we know and open them up to a way of learning that we 
have forgotten.</p> 
<p>As adults learning things academically and systematically are so emphasized 
that we have lost touch with the part of our brain that learns intuitively and 
through observation. Leonardo Da Vinci believed that experience is the best 
test of all truth and said But to me all knowledge is vain and fraught with 
errors unless it is born of experience, the mother of all certainty. Children, 
unlike adults, learn solely from experience, intuition, and observation and 
that is why they learn so quickly. So when learning plan activities that will 
help you learn naturally. Your experience will be more effective and more FUN!
</p> 
<p>Here is one activity that you can do to begin learning naturally. Over the 
next couple of weeks we will add more activities and the theory behind the 
practice.</p> 
<p>Here are some activities that you can do to help you learn like a Kid. You 
should try and learn some relevant vocabulary, culture, or background before 
your activity.</p> 
<p><strong>Play A Game</strong> &ndash; Kids always play games and will allow 
you to learn real life speaking skills in a relaxed and comfortable situation. 
Also, games do not demand a large vocabulary.</p> 
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Learn and Practice new vocab, Build Confidence, 
Strengthen Speaking and Listening skills, Learn new vocabulary.</p> Facebook -

<h3>Language Learning: Choosing a Teacher part 1</h3> 
<p>Written by Aaron</p> 
<p>Comments Off | &nbsp;Print This Post </p> <br>

<p>First of all there are many different dimensions to language learning and 
depending on your goals for learning a foreign language you will want to look 
for different qualities in your teacher. I will first cover the general 
characteristics that all language teachers should exude and I will follow that 
explanation with a more goal specific list of qualities your language teacher 
should have in Part 2.</p> 
<p>There are 5 qualities that all language teachers should have. Depending on 
your goals and needs some may be more or less important but generally these are 
the 5 principal attributes you should look for in a teacher of any kind.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Knowledge </strong>The teacher does not have to be an expert in 
the language but does need to have a significant understanding of the core 
concepts and ideas needed to help you progress and learn the language yourself. 
In order for someone to elevate you to a higher place they themselves must be 
in a higher place.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Experience Knowledge</strong> is essential however if the 
teacher has no practical experience that knowledge is useless. Its like a 
basketball coach who has read all the books but has never played the game. The 
coach will never be able to make a successful basketball team. The same is for 
languages. If your teacher cannot say that they have spent a significant amount 
of time living, speaking, or working with the people that speak the language 
there is no way they will have the cultural insight to teach you any real life 
language skills. However if your pursuit is solely academic this may not be a 
large issue and I will discuss why later.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Communication </strong>- You need to be able to relate and feel 
comfortable with your teacher socially. Languages are a social experience and 
if your teacher is shy, distant, or not invested then it will make your lessons 
very tedious and ineffective. You teacher needs to be constantly asking you 
questions, encouraging, and conversational.</p> 
<p>4. <strong>Enthusiasm </strong>Who wants a boring teacher? Nobody wants to 
learn a foreign language to be boring. If you teacher is not positive, 
friendly, and interested in the language and you as a student then they will 
most likely not give you 100% and will not require 100% from you.</p> 
<p>5. <strong>Vision </strong>The most important thing is that the teacher 
understands your goals and needs. In order for any teacher to build lessons 
that will achieve your goals they must understand your reasons for learning the 
language. If a teacher tells you that you have to learn a certain way because 
thats the way it is and is not interested in focusing on your interests then 
you should consider whether or not you are receiving effective language 
lessons. However sometimes teachers will need to tell you that it is not time 
to learn a certain subject or to tell you that a question will be answered at a 
later time because it is not time.</p> 
<p>Saying that we will come back to a subject at a later time is different 
than completely ignoring your goals. You should feel comfortable asking your 
teacher what their plan of action is and how they plan to help you achieve your 
goals in the language.</p> 
<p>* Part 2 will focus on goal specific skills and qualities that you should 
consider when choosing a foreign language tutor.</p> Facebook - Twitter - Digg -
