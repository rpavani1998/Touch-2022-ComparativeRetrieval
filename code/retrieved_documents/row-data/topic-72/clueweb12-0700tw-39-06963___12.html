<h3>What parents need to know</h3> 
<p>Parents need to know that this animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' beloved 
tale of THE LORAX is age-appropriate for younger kids; there's little scary 
stuff, and the pro-environmental message is a positive one. The main issue here 
is really the movie's huge number of consumerist tie-ins -- at least 70 
different marketing promotions. For an anti-materialism story to advertise so 
many products to kids and their parents sends a particularly confusing message. 
Still, the movie itself -- like the original story -- promotes conservation and 
protecting the environment. Kids will leave the film wanting to do more to help 
the natural world ... too bad that take-away will be diluted by the onslaught 
of available merchandise with the Lorax's bright-orange image on it.</p> 
<h3></h3> Educational value: <em>The Lorax</em> teaches a valuable lesson 
about the importance of the natural world and protecting natural resources. The 
idea of &quot;unless&quot; is pivotal to the story -- that Earth will continue 
to be polluted and destroyed &quot;unless&quot; people like Ted and Audrey 
stand up for it. <br>
Positive messages: Like the book, the movie promotes an 
environmental message about conservation. It also suggests the danger of giving 
into materialistic impulses that can damage the environment. The movie will 
make kids think about where their stuff comes from, whether having too much 
stuff is a good thing, and what the consequences of their actions might be. 
Unfortunately kids may be confused by these positive messages once they realize 
how many product tie-ins are associated with the movie (see 
&quot;Consumerism&quot; section). <br>
Positive role models: At first Ted is 
driven purely by his feelings for Audrey, but then he decides to learn the 
story of the Lorax and the Truffula trees for himself and to help his entire 
town; ultimately he turns out to be a brave guy who stands up for what's right. 
The Once-ler redeems the greedy acts of his past. Audrey and Grandma subvert 
the conventional idea that having plastic trees -- plastic<em>everything</em> 
-- is better than real nature. On the negative side, the Once-ler breaks his 
promise and allows his family to convince him to chop down all the trees to 
make a profit. <br>
Violence &amp; scariness: The Once-ler employs a huge 
machine attached to axes to chop down the Truffula trees. At one point, the 
Once-ler and a baby Barbaloot are floating on a mattress toward a waterfall, 
but neither is injured. A few characters are hit in the face with various 
objects (marshmallows, a hammer), but there's no lasting harm. <br>
Sexy stuff: 
Ted has a crush on Audrey; at the end of the movie, they share a brief kiss. He 
also imagines kissing her earlier in the film. <br>
Language: Language includes 
&quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;dumb.&quot; <br>
Consumerism: Although the film 
(and story) itself espouses the same ecologically friendly themes asDr. Seuss' 
book, the studio has agreed to more than 70 merchandise tie-ins, from the 
standard stuffed animals and figurines to the more egregious IHOP pancake 
platter and Mazda SUV promotions (the latter has included school events in 
which kids are urged to ask their parents to test-drive the vehicle). Many 
social critics have slammed the studio for taking Seuss' anti-consumerist 
message and turning it into an opportunity for the Lorax to promote various 
products. <br>

<h2>What's the story?</h2> 
<h6>What's the story?</h6> 
<p>In the town of Thneedville, there are no real trees, or grass, or nature to 
speak of -- everything is plastic and fake. When young Ted (voiced byZac Efron) 
discovers that what his crush, Audrey (Taylor Swift), wants more than anything 
is to see a real tree, he sets out to find one for her. Advised by his 
grandmother (Betty White), Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the reclusive 
Once-ler (Ed Helms), who tells him the story of The Lorax (Danny DeVito). As 
Ted learns more about the history of the Truffula Trees that the Once-ler 
chopped down, his life is Thneedville is challenged by the town's bigwig, Mr. 
O'Hare (Rob Riggle), who profits from the manufactured air that the citizens 
have been taught to buy and breathe. But if Ted exposes the truth to the people 
of Thneedville, they'll realize nature isn't the dirty inconvenience they've 
been taught to believe.</p> 
<h2>Is it any good?</h2> 
<h6>Is it any good?</h6>  &nbsp; 
<p>To those who consider THE LORAX Dr. Seuss' magnum opus, this adaptation 
will be at least somewhat a relief (unlike the miserable<em> The Cat in the Hat
</em>). It's light and sweet and frames the original story in an 
easy-to-understand plot about a boy who wants to impress his tree-obsessed 
crush. The star-studded voice cast does a fine job (the main characters are 
even named after Dr. Seuss -- Theodore Geisel -- and his widow, Audrey), and 
the songs are all upbeat, if not Randy Newman-memorable. If it weren't an 
adaptation,<em>The Lorax </em>would make for a fun, message-filled movie with a 
charming set of characters.</p> 
<p>The problem is that passionate lovers of <em>The Lorax</em> will expect 
more; they'll hope for a movie as timeless and important as Seuss' subversive 
commentary on the perils of conspicuous consumption and forsaking the 
environment to benefit the almighty dollar. But the studio has already marred 
that idea with its constant parading of various Lorax-approved products. Having 
the Lorax shill for an SUV or themed breakfasts is counter to the spirit of the 
story -- which, at least in the movie, promotes a return to nature. Kids will 
surely delight in<em>The Lorax</em>, but teens and parents savvy enough to 
recognize the irony of big-studio consumerism may wonder whether Dr. Seuss 
would have approved at all. (If you're looking for another take on the tale, 
try the excellent1970s adaptation -- it's shorter, but it doesn't have the 
pesky tie-ins to worry about.)</p>

<h6>Enjoyable for all ages, just minus the &quot;WOW&quot; for parents.</h6>  
While the movie was as enjoyable as we thought it would be and the story was 
charming and the kids gave it thumbs up, the parents left the theater a bit 
disappointed--movie didn't give us a &quot;WOW--THAT WAS AMAZING&quot; feeling 
like we'd hoped and expected it to. Still, a great movie that pleased the 
adults and kids alike, excellent for the littlest ones while still enjoyable 
for the oldest ones including the grown-ups. And how fun that it was released 
on Dr Seuss's birthday!  What other families should know <br>

<h6>disapointing.</h6>  I just came back from watching this movie with my 5 
year old kid. I will have lots of explaining to do. The movie go to an over 
reach attempt to demonize business man or the use of natural resources. I hope 
my kid does not feel guilty for sitting on a wooden chair as it's made of the 
corpse of a murdered tree. This kind of movie as they are highly political and 
never offer a constructive message as to using the planets resources 
responsibly (i.e. trees). Message in this movie is that you cut a tree you are 
a murderer.  What other families should know <br>

<h6>I wish I knew</h6>  The movie was cute and not too far out of the realm of 
the book. However, based on what I read from this site's review, I formed the 
opinion that there weren't really any scary moments. I chose to take my 4 year 
old and even though she tells me now that it wasn't scary, there were quite a 
few moments that she ended up in my lap or covering her eyes; thunder and 
lightning before the lorax shows up, when the onceler first looks through the 
window, and some of the intimidation moments from the bottled air guy - I'm 
sure there were more. Nothing lasted long and everything ends well, but if you 
have a sensitive child, there may be a moment or two with their face in your 
shoulder. The SCARIEST part was actually one of the previews for a movie called 
&quot;ParaNorman&quot;. It's a cartoonish movie about a kids who sees dead 
people. As you can imagine, his dead friends are not all nice looking and the 
preview was quite scary! Flag as inappropriate&nbsp;  was this review useful?

<h6>The Lorax is too scary for little kids.</h6>  If you are protective about 
what your children watch on tv, DO NOT take them to see The Lorax. There were 
two previews that were terrifying and the movie itself was scary. We had to 
leave 30 minutes into it. Totally disappointing... Flag as inappropriate&nbsp;

<h6>Watch out for the trailer of ParaNormal -- too scary for kids!</h6>  Just 
a warning to parents -- My movie theater showed a trailer to ParaNorman which 
totally freaked out my kids -- 1st and 3rd grade. Especially my 1st grader who 
only watched a second of it before covering her eyes for the remainder. The 
image stuck in her mind and came back to her when it was time to go to bed. She 
was crying that she couldn't stop thinking about it. And this is unusual for my 
daughter. And I know the movie is rated PG, but they are marketing this film to 
first graders -- her teacher read the book to the class the week of the opening 
and they made the trees as a craft. I think the movie was fine for her to 
watch, but the trailer was not!  What other families should know <br>

<h6>Junk Food for your Eyes and Ears</h6>  This movie is not for children who 
can't already recognize that attitudes expressed in a film may not be 
appropriate or representative of real life. But every cloud has a silver 
lining: The film would be very good for teaching bad writing. Junk food makers 
spend their money on packaging, not nutritional content. It's cheaper and 
easier. That's what this movie is: A junk food version of Dr Seuss. Beautiful, 
to attract you, but empty, even negative at the core. Flag as inappropriate

<h6>the movie was perfect for my first grader!</h6>  the lorax was much better 
than i expected! the storyline moved quickly, and the graphics and characters 
were developed enough to support the storyline. my first grader read the book 
before seeing the movie and was mesmerized by the story. the theme of 
environmental responsibility was not at all preachy, but conveyed simply enough 
so that my son said he felt sad when they cut down the last tree. i considered 
bringing my 4yo to watch this movie, and am glad i did not. she would need to 
be at least 6yo to appreciate this movie.  What other families should know <br>

<h6>The Lorax in IMAX Tree-D</h6>  The Lorax has good messages but should not

<h6>Amazing Movie!!!!!</h6>  The acting was wonderful and I enjoyed the 
animation. The ending was very uplifting and the charectors were completely 
fleshed out. It does the book justice completely. Even though I am in 6th 
grade, I enjoyed it. A marvelous family film. However, my 6-year-old sister was 
a bit worried by one particular song, so parents may want to check it out 
first. Although Common Sense Media notes consumerism, I couldn't really find a 
mention of any products, and neither could the three people I went with. If 
there is any, its too subtle to be noticed.  What other families should know

<h6>ECO and Family Friendly Movie</h6>  Cute Movie with a good message. The 
Lorax is about a brave boy who tries to impress a girl gets involved into a 
battle of the trees. Of course it teaches kids a valuable lesson to respect the 
environment around them with witty humour and colourful songs. Education: The 
world unless is used to emphasize the environmental issue Positive: It teaches 
kids to treat the earth with air. Good Role Models: Ted is a courageous boy and 
Audrey is passionate about the environment. It sneaks some product placement in 
the movie, but it's fine.  What other families should know <br>
