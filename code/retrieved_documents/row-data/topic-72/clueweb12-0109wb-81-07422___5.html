Archived chat <br>
<br>

<p>Recent focus on academic achievement coupled with the persistent 
achievement gap between English language learners (ELL) and non-ELLs have 
caused researchers and educators to take a closer look at how to help ELLs 
master oral English and academic content as well. On November 1, 2007, the 
Center for Public Education hosted a live online chat on the topic. For more 
insight, see the Center's&nbsp;review of research&nbsp;&nbsp;on ELLs, prepared 
by Edvantia, an education research and development not-for-profit corporation.

<p>Patte Barth, Director, Center for Public Education, comments:</p> 
<p>Welcome everyone! Let's chat about English Language Learners.</p> 
<p>An association staff member from Washington, DC writes:</p> 
<p>What percent of ELL students are Spanish speaking? What other languages are 
typically spoken by ELL students?</p> 
<p>Center for Public Education answers:</p> 
<p>About 4 out of 5 ELL students has Spanish as his or her first language. The 
rest speak any of 400 other languages at home. Vietnamese is a distant second 
at 2 percent&nbsp;of all ELL students.</p> A school board member from NY writes:
<p>The research review says that instruction in the child's first language can 
be beneficial. Our school district enrolls ELL students speaking approximately 
30 different languages. How can we provide first-language instruction for all 
of these children?</p> 
<p>Center for Public Education answers:</p> 
<p>You raise one of the great challenges for teaching ELL students. While the 
research is pretty persuasive about the benefit of some first language 
instruction, in language diverse districts like yours it can be really 
difficult to provide qualified teachers for each of the languages your students 
bring to the classroom. Your best resources might come from your community in 
the form of bilingual volunteers or aides who can help bridge the language gap. 
Some of the new technologies might also help.</p> A superintendent from TX 
writes: 
<p>Is it important for students to have bilingual teachers, even in subjects 
like math and science?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Having a math teacher who is bilingual is less important than having one 
who is trained in ESL and knows how to help ELL students master the field's 
academic language and content. For example, words such as odd, root, and field 
have a special meaning in math. Teachers need to know that students need 12 to 
14 exposures to these and other words commonly used in math (e.g., determine, 
whereas, factor). Sometimes we forget that learning math involves much more 
than numbers, or that science has a vocabulary of its own.</p> A parent from DC 
writes: 
<p>How long should it take for a non-English speaking kindergartner to learn 
English?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Many factors influence the length of time an individual child takes to 
learn English. Usually ELLs begin to learn&nbsp;enough&nbsp;&quot;social 
English&quot; rather quickly to get by on the playground. One California study 
that tracked English language learners starting in kindergarten found that, on 
average, they took 3&ndash;5 years to develop oral proficiency. However, they 
took 4&ndash;7 years to develop proficiency in &quot;academic English,&quot; 
the sort of language used in textbooks and classrooms.</p> 
<p>We sometimes expect young children to learn a second language more quickly 
because of the often-repeated belief that &quot;it's easier for children than 
it is for adults.&quot; But what linguistic studies actually show is that young 
children are more likely to develop more native-like pronunciation&ndash;not 
that they learn the language faster.</p> A school board member from VA writes: 
<p>What role do parents play in helping their ELL students succeed in school? 
Is it important for teachers to work with the parents of ELL kids?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>In 1997, the National Research Council found that family involvement is one 
component of effective schooling for ELL students. For ELL and non-ELL students 
alike, parents can help students succeed in school by letting their child know 
that they think school is important, ensuring regular attendance, and involving 
them in learning activities at home. Teachers can honor the home cultures of 
ELL students, make ELL parents feel welcome, and show them what to do at home 
to support their child's education. For teachers, the challenge is often 
finding ways to overcome communication and cultural barriers. To be effective, 
they may need professional development and other supports.</p> A parent from 
Milford, CT writes: 
<p>Isn't true that most ELL students are not only trying to learn the language 
but also learn our culture, since they are coming here from another country?</p>
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>That may be true of immigrant students, but more than half of the ELLs in 
U.S. schools were born in the United States. Family immigrant status is one of 
the many factors that influence a student's acquisition of English.</p> An 
educator from IL writes: 
<p>Does the time it takes to learn English vary by the child's country of 
origin? Do other factors have an effect?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Large California studies have shown differences among students from various 
countries, but these differences were related to ethnic-group differences in 
family income and parent education. As is often the case, socioeconomic status 
matters. Another important student background factor is the amount of formal 
schooling the student has experienced in his or her first language.</p> An 
educator from Myrtle Beach, SC writes: 
<p>Which is a more effective practice, bilingual or English-only instruction?
</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>In their massive review of the literature, the National Literacy Panel on 
Language-Minority Children and Youth concluded that the inclusion of some 
first-language instruction and support seems to have long-term benefits. Many 
small studies and meta-analyses of small studies have reached the same 
conclusion.</p> 
<p>However, large-scale comparisons between bilingual education and 
English-only programs have not been possible because the way a school or 
district labels its program is not necessarily an accurate description of what 
happens in the classroom.</p> An educator from Columbus, OH writes: 
<p>Are state assessments, like the Ohio Achievement Tests, proper tools to 
measure English proficiency?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>According to NCLB, assessments of English language arts and/or reading 
cannot be used to measure students' English language proficiency, nor can 
assessments of English language proficiency be used to measure students' 
achievement in English language arts or reading.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> An educator from Columbus, OH writes: 
<p>Why is it that oral proficiency often doesn't translate to academic 
proficiency?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>You have hit upon the difference between &quot;social English,&quot; the 
kind you might use on the playground and in the supermarket, and &quot;academic 
English,&quot; the kind of English used in classrooms and textbooks. Often, a 
student who seems to be a fairly fluent speaker in social settings may struggle 
in the classroom. Students can begin to pick up on social English very quickly.
</p> 
<p>On the other hand, some students who do not speak English very well may 
perform well academically. This is especially true of students with a strong 
academic background in their native country or students whose parents are well 
educated.</p> An educator from NC writes: 
<p>Are there misconceptions that can cloud policy around ELL students? Do 
people bring some of their preconceived ideas into the debate about how to best 
teach English to ELL students?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Sometimes people have bought into myths about educating ELLs. For example, 
some people may fear that teaching a child in his or her native language may 
keep the child from learning English. As mentioned previously, some people may 
think that young children pick up the language quicker than adolescents or 
adults. This is not true. There is also the mistaken belief that because a 
student is reclassified as English proficient, he or she does not need 
additional ESL support services.</p> A school board member from LA writes: 
<p>Can testing accommodations provide better information about what ELLs 
really know and can do?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Several studies have found linguistic modifications of test questions with 
excessive language demands to be effective. A recent meta-analysis from the 
Center on Instruction found that allowing students to use an English dictionary 
had the greatest effect, but the researchers noted that &quot;for this 
accommodation to be successful in the testing situation, students must have 
experience with it during regular instruction.&quot; The research that has been 
conducted, however, has been on a fairly small scale, and more research is 
needed before we will really have good answers to questions about testing 
accommodations that can help ELLs succeed.</p> An educator from KS writes: 
<p>Do ELL students drop out more than others?</p> 
<p>Patte Barth, Director, Center for Public Education, answers:</p> 
<p>Several researchers have found this to be true, but it's hard to find real 
data. We know that Latino students drop out at higher rates, although not all 
Latino students are ELL. However, we also know that struggling students and 
students who are not engaged in school are more likely to drop out, so keeping 
kids feeling like they are&nbsp;part of the school culture and on track 
academically should help ELL kids, too.</p> An educator from MD writes: 
<p>Is it harder for high school students who come in not speaking English to 
become English proficient, than younger ELL students?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Research has consistently shown that adolescents and adults learn academic 
English more quickly, presumably because they have more background knowledge 
and a more developed frame of reference. That said, we must remember that if an 
ELL student is in high school and not speaking English, that student could be 
an immigrant who must adjust to a new culture while trying to master advanced 
academic work. In fact, about half of all secondary ELL students are 
foreign-born, and the rest were born in the United States.</p> A parent from TN 
writes: 
<p>We're seeing a huge influx of students from other countries. I was 
wondering what other states, besides those on the border, are seeing more ELL 
students?</p> 
<p>Patte Barth, Director, Center for Public Education, answers:</p> 
<p>You're right that California and Texas have by far the largest number of 
ELL students. In California, about one in five students is ELL. But nearly 
every state is seeing growth in ELL populations, including Tennessee. New York, 
Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey are seeing big growth. These states account 
for two-thirds of all immigrants, and 69 percent&nbsp;of all elementary school 
children, according to the 2000 Census.</p> A school board member from MN 
writes: 
<p>Is there an achievement gap between ELL students and English-speaking 
students in other subjects like math and science?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Yes, and this should not be surprising. After all, we use English to teach 
and discuss these subjects. And each of these subjects has its own unique 
vocabulary. For example, a table in the lunchroom is not the same thing as a 
table in mathematics. This points to the importance of providing explicit 
vocabulary instruction to ELLs in the content areas. Research on the 
effectiveness of different types of ELL programs has shown that student 
achievement in the content areas can differ significantly based on the type of 
ELL program in which the student is&nbsp;enrolled.</p> A school board member 
from MD writes: 
<p>Do you know the percent of ELLs who have little or no formal education in 
their native countries? I understand that half of the ELLs were born in the 
United States, what&nbsp;are the other half's formal education backgrounds?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>We don't really know the answer to this question, and it is unlikely that 
the states are consistently gathering data that would answer the question at 
this point. But we do have information about the level of education parents of 
ELL students have. For example, about half of the students from Mexico and 
Central America have parents who did not complete high school. But the prior 
educational experience of ELL students is something that school districts 
should collect to better serve their ELL students.</p> A school board member 
from ID writes: 
<p>Will focusing on academic English specifically for ELLs take away from 
other students?</p> 
<p>Research Team, Edvantia, answers:</p> 
<p>Definitely not. In fact, Fred Genessee and colleagues concluded that an 
emphasis on academic English is likely to yield a payoff in student achievement 
&quot;even in English-only school settings.&quot; Research is showing that 
direct, explicit instruction in literacy strategies, including vocabulary 
development, helps students learn in all content areas.</p> An educator from 
Capitol Heights, MD writes: 
<p>What states have more success with ELL students in their academic programs 
in elementary, middle, and high school?</p> 
<p>Patte Barth, Director, Center for Public Education, answers:</p> 
<p>It's difficult to say because states use very different criteria to 
classify ELL students and reclassify them as English proficient. For example, 
there are 24 different tests being used to measure English proficiency. You 
might want to refer to the What Works Clearinghouse which just evaluated 
effective elementary ELL programs. Also check the list of resources posted on 
the Center for Public Education website for more information about effective 
programs.</p>
