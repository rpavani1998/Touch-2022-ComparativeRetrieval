<h3>Three Point Five Soldiers</h3> 
<p><em>Guardian</em> #4 takes us to the midpoint of the <em>Seven Soldiers</em>
 storyline with a brilliant episode that offers equal parts of revelations of 
the past and tantalizing hints of the future.&nbsp; The comic sports some of 
the best art I've seen yet from Cameron Stewart, and it's one of Grant 
Morrison's finest single installments of this series.&nbsp; But others have 
already praised the masters or sifted through the entrails to divine plot 
details (Jog and the people over at Barbelith do their usual excellent jobs) so 
there's no need to repeat that.&nbsp; Here instead are the thoughts that 
linger, the discoveries made, the reasons I so love this issue.</p> 
<p>The comic opens with a magnificently loopy Golden Age adventure sequence, 
dialogued as only Morrison can (&quot;And look what's up ahead!&nbsp;<em>
Wouldja believe a land of golden top hats!</em>&quot;).&nbsp; He hasn't mined 
that vein as richly since the glory days of<em>Flex Mentallo</em> (&quot;Think 
as hard as you like, Earthman, you'll never be my intellectual equal!&nbsp;<em>
I, the Counting Tree!</em>&quot;).&nbsp; Bonus points to Stewart and colorist 
Moose Baumann for the scratched, faded art reminiscent of an old and forgotten 
film.</p> 
<p>The revelation that Ed Stargard is stuck in a state of permanent infancy is 
a little more biting than these Kirby tributes usually turn out (although not 
moreso than Mark Millar's Dr. Krigstein in<em>The Authority</em>, a twisted 
dwarf creating concepts for his masters' misuse, to whom Ed bears a strong 
physical if not moral resemblance). As one commentator on Barbelith notes, it 
makes Ed &quot;the spirit of superhero comics made flesh,&quot; a perfect 
hypostasis for superhero comics: aged and matured but still eternally youthful 
(or, depending on how you want to look at it, developmentally arrested).&nbsp; 
The hypostasis and the Kirby angle really work, though, because Morrison's 
essential affection for the character, and the artist and genre he embodies, 
outshine the insulting implications.&nbsp; Morrison recognizes the genre's 
flaws but he loves it anyway, warts and all.&nbsp; That doesn't mean he won't 
subject it to some dramatic changes.</p> 
<p>(<em>Pedantic obsession alert:</em>&nbsp; Speaking of literalized metaphors 
and the symbolic order,Cameron Stewart confirms that in his vision of his ideal 
state, Baby Brain is reading a book labeled &quot;LACAN.&quot;)</p> 
<p>((Incidentally, did the extranarrative panels divulging the fates of the 
Newsboy Army remind anybody else of the extranarrative &quot;interview&quot; 
panels in<em>Eightball</em> #23, especially the ones where Andy's victims 
speak?&nbsp; I don't know if Morrison or Stewart planned any conscious 
homage--we do know Morrisonliked &quot;The Death-Ray&quot;--but the connection 
appeals to me because it would mean that, as withWe3, Morrison and Stewart are 
willing to pinch<em>any</em> trick from <em>any</em> comic to spice up their 
superheroic storytelling.&nbsp; This is Morrison's preferred path for changing 
the superhero genre, the heteroglossia of technical homage and not the 
imposition of cruel or tawdry realism.&nbsp; Speaking of which...))</p> 
<p>Morrison also works an interesting twist into the Kirby kid-gang homage of 
the Newsboy Army.&nbsp; Obviously they're based on the Newsboy Legion template, 
with Baby Brain as Big Words, Kid Scarface as Scrapper, and Captain 7 and 
Ali-ka-Zoom can fight it out over who gets to be Flippa Dippa (I'm thinking the 
loser).&nbsp; They're also<em>every other</em> Kirby kid gang, even the worst 
of them, the &quot;Newsboys of Nowhere Street&quot; coming straight fromthe 
Dingbats of Danger Street.&nbsp; Contary to my earlier comments about the Stan 
Lee-ness of the Jake Jordan headliner and his adventure in the subways, the 
Newsboy Army is Simon/Kirby all the way.</p> 
<p>But Morrison takes them beyond mere homage when he shows us their origin in 
the shadow of the United Nations.&nbsp; The multicultural assembly of kids 
vaguely recalls last issue's Century Hollow, a tourist attraction in which one 
hundred animatrons form a demographically accurate representation of the 
world's population.&nbsp; The Newsboy Army is that project of miniaturization 
rendered even smaller, a &quot;United Nation of Kids.&quot;</p> 
<p>Both groups break down into murder; both times the violence is sparked by 
sex, or anxieties over sex (Jorge Control tells the police his wife has sex 
with the animatrons); both conflicts are played out as struggles of sober adult 
responsibility vs. childlike pleasure.&nbsp; (Jorge says &quot;The world is not 
a playground, my dear, it's a battlefield.&nbsp; Century Hollow was to be my 
3-dimensional map of political and social reality, not your tawdry theme 
park!&quot;)&nbsp; That's also a conflict between realistic art and fantasy, a 
point Jog makes well in his review.&nbsp; In both issues would-be realists try 
to punish those who create or dwell in worlds of fantasy or pleasure.&nbsp; 
(And yet, and yet... Jorge's revenge takes the form of a world in miniature of 
terrordroids and the Newsboy Army's destroyer is named the Terrible Time 
Tailor.&nbsp; Is Morrison covertly tilting the scales towards fantasy after 
all--with the understanding that &quot;fantastic&quot; doesn't have to mean 
&quot;nice&quot;?)</p> 
<p>These binaries of child and adult, pleasure and control, fantasy and 
realism resonate throughout<em>Seven Soldiers</em>.&nbsp; But more than just 
demonstrating some higher meaning, the correlation between the Newsboy Army and 
Century Hollow appeals to me because it illustrates<em>how</em> Morrison 
imparts meaning--by distributing it throughout each individual part of the 
narrative.</p> 
<p>Early reactions to <em>Seven Soldiers</em> were characterized by 
disappointment that the crossover wasn't living up to Morrison's much-hyped 
claim that each miniseries,<em>nay, each issue</em> would be a standalone 
story.&nbsp; That claim was pretty much shot to pieces by the first installment 
of<em>Shining Knight</em>.&nbsp; Plotwise, most of the issues aren't 
self-contained and it's starting to look like most of the miniseries won't be, 
either--not that this necessarily lessens the quality.&nbsp; But the issues 
might possess an even more important kind of self-sufficiency if even a 
throwaway story like &quot;Siege at Century Hollow&quot; can dramatize some of 
the larger questions that dominate the narrative.&nbsp; It's a classic Morrison 
technique of holographic distribution in which each individual part reflects 
the themes of the whole.&nbsp; He's done this many times before, transparently 
or subtly (I really should write sometime about how every issue of<em>Animal Man
</em> ties into the plot or themes explicated in the final, transcendent arc), 
but he's never done it quite like this before, breaking the hologram across so 
many different narrative arcs.</p> 
<p>More links, more contradictions:&nbsp; &quot;Sex Secrets of the Newsboy 
Army&quot; is another story of summer's end (the name, of course, of the Sheeda 
homeland), of kids who force one last childhood adventure when they should all 
be moving on to college and sex and adulthood (or at least late 
adolescence).&nbsp; When the group threatens to split (&quot;two teams&quot;?) 
the case for youth is made by Baby Brain, naturally, and Kid Scarface (who will 
find eternal life of a different sort, and horrible stasis, in the cauldron of 
Unwhen).&nbsp; But to judge by their costumed identities, these kids already 
wanted to be adults, or at least a child's vision of adults.&nbsp; They're all 
junior versions of glamorous adult careers: quarterback! movie star! magician! 
gangster!&nbsp; Not a remotely realistic vision of adulthood of course, but 
their own guises betray Baby Brain's desire/biological imperative to remain 
young.&nbsp; The conflict is interesting because it exists within the heroes, 
not just between them and their elderly enemy; if it didn't, the horrible crime 
that sunders the Newsboy Army could never have happened in the first place.</p> 
<p>And after their story ends (too quickly--my only complaint) we have the 
beautifully ominous final pages. I love the moment when the lights go out as 
the rain beats down and the Sheeda assault begins; it's the first time the 
crossover has felt truly momentous and truly scary since Gwydion destroyed 
Zatanna's group or maybe since J. H. Williams helped Morrison finish off the 
first, flawed group of Seven Soldiers.&nbsp; (And, to follow my personal<em>
Swamp Thing</em> obsession, I look at that panel of Jake against the window and 
I think:&nbsp; &quot;It's raining in New York tonight.&quot;&nbsp; But that, I 
concede, is only my reaction and not anything the story appears to be 
signalling.&nbsp; At most a mood it tries to recapture--but it<em>nails</em> 
it.)</p> 
<p>Really, a perfect issue and one of the finest chapters of <em>Seven Soldiers
</em> thus far; certainly the one that's got me most eager to see what happens 
next.</p> 
<p><strong>Postscript.</strong>&nbsp; TypePad informs me that this is my 100th 
post.&nbsp; Which goes to show just how much time I've put into a blog I 
started back in March of 2004.</p> 
<p>Actually, that's deceptive.&nbsp; I've put a hell of a lot of time into it, 
mostly because I keep crafting long exegeses like this post instead of those 
short, sharp bursts I somehow never acquired the knack for.&nbsp; I love 
writing for this blog:&nbsp; it's led to a great sense of community with many 
people I've never met and it's even generated a few pieces that have led to 
more professionally beneficial works.&nbsp; Since I clearly can't let go of the 
ruminations on figuration and symbolism in comics I think I may need to work it 
up into a proper book:&nbsp; Morrison alone rates at least a chapter.</p> 
<p>But there's the rub:&nbsp; the time I spend blogging is time I can't spend 
writing academic articles or books or fiction or novels or anything else.&nbsp; 
As I've put my writing priorities on those, where they belong, I've let I Am 
NOT the Beastmaster dwindle into near-silence.&nbsp; In the interest of freeing 
up still more time, I need to do a lot less blogging.</p> 
<p>This isn't the end of this blog.&nbsp; In order to consolidate my time, 
though, I've decided to step down fromThe Howling Curmudgeons.&nbsp; I wish 
them well and I appreciate having had the forum.&nbsp; But the separation may 
be for the best; exporting all my posts on crap comics over there always was, 
in part, a doomed attempt at making this site something other than 
&quot;just&quot; a comics blog, a craven bid at exactly the kind of 
respectability I think comics don't need.&nbsp; Besides, some of my favorite 
posts here contain insane rants about Thanos and &quot;Disco Madness with 
Mysterio.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps this will be a homecoming of sorts.</p> 
<p>So face front, True Believers!&nbsp; I am, and ever remain,</p> 
<p>NOT the Beastmaster.</p>

<h3>Situational Awareness</h3> 
<p>Not much blogging here lately between late-summer travel, the start of the 
semester, conference planning, and a national disaster that dwarfs my ability 
to say anything useful.&nbsp; (And really, that's the greatest tragedy, isn't 
it?&nbsp;<em>Not as much blogging</em>.)&nbsp; I'm always amazed by those who 
are able to immerse themselves into the political coverage and blogs and spin 
and come out with something cogent but I have neither the time nor the 
inclination to keep up with the inundation of words our political classes are 
trying to pour into the space left by the receding floodwaters.</p> 
<p>So I'm grateful to those who have waded in with the goal of keeping our 
attention, our sympathy, and our ire focused right where they belong.&nbsp;Doug 
Tonks has been providing a steady supply of clear-minded commentary on Katrina 
and the aftermath.&nbsp; Inhis most recent post, Doug links to this article in 
which the<em>Washington Post</em>'s Dan Froomkin observes that the mainstream 
media have finally started admitting whatthese folks were saying long ago.</p> 
<p>It's about time the press started observing that Bush's willing departure 
from the &quot;reality-based community&quot; has led to terrible consequences, 
not just abroad but right here at home.&nbsp; Like the hero of one of those 
postmodern novels his base claims September 11threndered irrelevant, Bush has 
decided to create his own reality from the comfort of his seemingly permanent 
vacation.&nbsp; Unlike most of those characters, reality has lashed back at 
him.&nbsp; Maybe the jury's no longer out on global warming?&nbsp; How about 
the importance of civic infrastructure?&nbsp; The Department of Homeland 
Security?&nbsp; The benefits of patronage?&nbsp;<em>Brownie?</em></p> 
<p>Anyway, it's nice to see our media growing its adult teeth back, at least 
temporarily, although it's come a couple thousand people too late.&nbsp; 
Apparently letting Americans die needlessly only becomes a problem once you 
startdoing it at home.&nbsp; (Incidentally, the Froomkin article ends with a 
discussion of how the Bush administration has used Katrina to hand out more 
no-bid contracts to old friends.&nbsp; Read the whole thing.)</p> 
<p>So the last couple of weeks haven't been any fun at all.&nbsp; Well, not 
entirely: if I want incisive commentary on current events I can always go 
straight toold <em>Flash</em> covers.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Love Triangle</h3> 
<p>Ah, for the days when the Bizarre Boys ruled the X-Men. Back in 2001 Grant 
Morrison&rsquo;s<em>New X-Men</em> and Peter Milligan&rsquo;s <em>X-Force</em> 
set a new paradigm for Marvel Comics&rsquo; top franchise, all but ending their 
reliance on inscrutable continuity and interminable angst.</p> 
<p><em>New X-Men</em> kept the skeleton of the vintage Claremont comics, the 
presentation of mutants as a minority class and the maintenance of 
long-running, twist-laden plotlines, an art all but lost in this age of writing 
for the trade paperback. But Morrison welded that framework to a contemporary 
portrayal of minority subculture, scientific anxiety, revolutionary 
iconography, collapsing relationships and ethnic cleansing that belatedly 
brought the hottest heroes of the 1970s into the present.&nbsp; Yet for all 
Morrison&rsquo;s loudly advertised innovation, Milligan&rsquo;s<em>X-Force</em> 
was the more radical book, perversely repurposing one of the most superfluous 
mutant titles&mdash;one originally created for hack supreme Rob 
Liefeld&mdash;into a savage satire on mass media, popular culture, and the 
stuffy, self-important X-Men franchise itself.</p> 
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t last.&nbsp; <em>X-Force</em> suffered a painful decline: 
first from an ill-advised name change (reportedly so Marvel wouldn&rsquo;t have 
to pay Liefeld for the rights) that caused them to hemorrhage readers, then 
from corporate interference that gutted a major storyline which might have 
revitalized the book.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Morrison departed<em>New X-Men</em> just 
as an editorial change at Marvel resulted in a new dictate to turn back the 
clock on almost everything he and Milligan had accomplished.&nbsp; Dirk Deppey 
chronicled the transformation inthese essays for his new and improved <em>
Comics Journal</em> last year.&nbsp; He also surveyed the aftermath, a task 
that would daunt any reviewer this side ofPaul O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; In the 
cruelest twist of fate, the New Old Marvel hired Rob Liefeld to do<em>X-Force
</em>.</p> 
<p>Fortunately even counter-revolutions peter out after a while.&nbsp; Now 
Peter Milligan is back on<em>X-Men</em>, the comic that used to be 
Morrison&rsquo;s, but it just isn&rsquo;t the same.&nbsp; The subversive spirit 
of<em>X-Force</em> survives only in occasional flashes of wit, buried under 
heavy strata of the same old X-Men business as usual.&nbsp; (Two characters 
choose codenames spelled with multiple Xs and Milligan doesn&rsquo;t crack wise 
once.)&nbsp; The comic doesn&rsquo;t suffer for lack of skill; after a 
meandering and disappointing opening arc, Milligan&rsquo;s run has shaped up 
nicely as a clever character study.&nbsp; His most recent storyline, 
&ldquo;Bizarre Love Triangle&rdquo; (of course), probes under the skin of a 
longstanding X-Men relationship and reaches the only reasonable conclusion that 
it can&rsquo;t last.&nbsp; All in all it&rsquo;s a smarter than average bit of 
X-Men soap opera.</p> 
<p>The problem is that it&rsquo;s <em>only</em> a bit of X-Men soap 
opera.&nbsp; For four issues the X-Men do nothing but sit around the mansion 
and&hellip; what was the term?... angst over their relationships.&nbsp; There 
isn&rsquo;t a single mutant rescue, Sentinel attack, shadowy conspiracy or plot 
for world domination in sight&mdash;not even so much as a bank robbery to 
foil.&nbsp; Milligan&rsquo;s relationship dynamics aren&rsquo;t nearly as 
melodramatic (or overwritten) as they were in Claremont&rsquo;s heyday, but if 
you can tell a four-issue story that doesn&rsquo;t feature one single act of 
superheroics then I&rsquo;m not certain you need to be telling that story with 
superheroes anymore.&nbsp; Well, except that the love triangle absolutely 
depends on uncontrollable contact power-absorption and shapeshifting.</p> 
<p>This is the dilemma that Milligan&rsquo;s <em>X-Men</em> and, by extension, 
most DC and Marvel superhero comics find themselves in these days.&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;re built upon the tropes and history of long-established superhero 
universes yet they are with increasing frequency telling stories in which 
superheroes are all but irrelevant.&nbsp; Instead they mine out the 
implications of their universes&rsquo; bizarre premises, exotic characters, and 
baroque histories.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a word for this kind of story: <em>fanfic</em>.&nbsp; And 
while &ldquo;Bizarre Love Triangle&rdquo; is pretty good fanfic (although it 
very nearly qualifies as<em>slash</em>), I&rsquo;d rather see the talented 
Milligan produce new material, not just play around in the bones of the old.</p>
<p>Which is a strange but not inaccurate charge to level at Milligan&rsquo;s 
book.&nbsp; Unlike so many other contemporary superhero comics, it&rsquo;s not 
obsessed with nostalgia and it doesn&rsquo;t attempt to revisit or recreate its 
own past.&nbsp; (In writingthese reviews I resorted to the word 
&ldquo;pastiche&rdquo; so many times I had to start looking for other 
terms.)&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s just as dependent on that past, and while it works 
little changes in the temporary status quo it never pushes against the 
fundamental, tried-and-true premises of the superhero soap opera book.&nbsp; 
Perfectly well-executed if you like that sort of thing, but nothing we 
haven&rsquo;t seen before&mdash;and from the Bizarre Boys, of all people, we 
expect something different.</p>

<h3>To the Ocean by Hard Ways</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Friday July 22.&nbsp; The first time I feel like I've earned my view of the 
Pacific.&nbsp; Two days after hiking in Utah at 8500 feet I'm standing on a 
deck in Malibu at about 10.&nbsp; I've tumbled from the hoodoos at Bryce Canyon 
to rooms at the Flamingo to this beachside rehearsal dinner.&nbsp; The sun sets 
behind a beach house and a private helicopter buzzes low over the surf.&nbsp; 
California once again arranges itself to be extra Californian.&nbsp; Literally 
arranges itself, since the restaurant has cemented the rocks to create more 
dramatic breaks as the waves roll in.&nbsp; Later that night it's a show at the 
Viper Room - we'll leave before the Guns N' Roses simulation takes the stage - 
and the next evening at a hotel in Santa Monica with just a glimmer of an ocean 
view I will watch as an actor whose work I know and like dances with my 
in-laws.&nbsp; He won't look so tough the next time Daredevil drops him under a 
train.&nbsp; From the first tumbleweed in New Mexico everything in this trip 
has been itself, only more so.</p>

<h3>Follow the Leader</h3> 
<p>I've been following the G-8 summit closely this week, hoping that last 
weekend's call for African aid and debt relief would amount to more than just 
anotherwell-meaning symbolic gesture.&nbsp; But it's become impossible to talk 
about the summit without talking about yesterday's abominable terror 
attacks.&nbsp; I'm somewhat appalled that my first thoughts wavered between<em>
I hope this doesn't derail the talks</em>and <em>at least it didn't happen last 
Saturday</em>.&nbsp; Either one is cold comfort to those who were caught in the 
attacks or know someone who was.</p> 
<p>(<strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp; At least it wasn't &quot;Hmmm, time to 
buy.&quot;)</p> 
<p>And make no mistake, this one does strike a chord. I was evacuated from an 
underground station once during a false alarm in 1999, shortly after thenail 
bombings.&nbsp; At the time I was staying on Upper Woburn Place, less than a 
block away from the site where the bus exploded yesterday.&nbsp; In a sinister 
bit of synchronicity, I received a package yesterday that included a touristy 
London T-shirt.&nbsp; A souvenir from my dad, who was there a few weeks ago and 
will no doubt be back soon.</p> 
<p>This is not an abstract problem; this is not somebody else's problem; and 
those who imply that the British somehow deserved this because they have 
committed the crime of tolerating Muslims have sacrificed the most basic human 
sympathy for the opportunity to score a cheap and false political point.&nbsp; 
It wasn't so long ago that these vultures were blubbering about our own 
tragedies and thanking the British for their tremendous show of support but 
that kindness hasn't been repaid; I guess Africans aren't the only people 
looking for 100% debt relief.</p> 
<p>I am glad the attacks didn't happen last weekend when London Transport was 
flooded with an extra 200,000 people.&nbsp; Still, that can't be any 
consolation to those who were riding the tube or the buses on Thursday morning 
instead of Saturday night.&nbsp; You have my deepest condolences.</p> 
<p>I'm also glad Tony Blair and the other G-8 leaders apparently didn't allow 
the attacks to deter them from discussing African aid and debt relief.&nbsp; 
(Naturally it's too early to say how the agenda did or didn't change after the 
bomings but Blair at least seems undaunted in his commitment.)&nbsp; Africa has 
been a home to Al-Qaeda before and it could be again, and ending the cycles of 
debt and poverty is one of the best things the West can do to prevent future 
attacks - certainly better than starting superfluous wars against Al-Qaeda's 
Arab enemies.</p> 
<p>Ah, but that war is difficult to ignore, especially when the political 
leader of the poverty reduction movement is also one of the war's chief 
architects - the one we might reasonably have expected to know better.&nbsp; 
It's interesting to comparethis take on Tony Blair by comics creators Mark 
Millar and Sean Philips withthis one by <em>Washington Post</em> columnist 
Jefferson Morley.&nbsp; The main difference is that one is about the G-8 summit 
and one really isn't.</p> 
<p>I suppose the comic is more subtle than most of Millar's work, but that bar 
isn't set very high.&nbsp; (The comic isn't any better written, as Millar can't 
even distinguish between Bush's voice and Blair's.&nbsp; Of the two, which one 
do you think is saying &quot;all about you and me and the war and 
stuff&quot;?)&nbsp; Although Millar is obviously critical of Bush, and Blair's 
collaboration with Bush, he gives all the best lines to Bush's cynicism and 
condescension and claims of necessary evils.&nbsp; This problem is by no means 
limited to Millar; some people might say it's easier to imagine greed than 
idealism, that good is harder to write than evil, but I think it's for lack of 
trying.</p> 
<p>And isn't it amusing how Bush's lines sound so similar to so many left (or 
stage-left) critiques of Live8 and the debt relief movement?&nbsp; &quot;This 
was just a pop concert to those guys... somethin' to make them feel better 
about their cheap import sneakers and their aerosol deodorants [...] That's 
just the way the system works and they just ease their conscience by singin' 
songs about us every once in a while.&quot;&nbsp; This confluence should tell 
us something, even it it's only that Millar is a deliriously, exuberantly 
defeatist leftist too.&nbsp; No, that's too snide - Millar actually offers a 
nice illustration of the process by which cynicism supports the status quo 
under the guise of deflating the idealists.</p> 
<p>The last panel suggests Blair has abandoned that idealism and is simply 
trailing in Bush's wake.&nbsp; (Remember, this is Jamesian subtlety by Millar's 
standards.)&nbsp; Blair deserves that slap and worse for following Bush into 
optional war in Iraq, even to the point of taking part in thefabrication of the 
cause for war.&nbsp; If this comic were about Iraq I'd have no objection to 
Millar's points.&nbsp; (Just his execution.)</p> 
<p>But it's nominally about the G-8 summit, where Blair isn't cast so easily 
as Bush's poodle.&nbsp; Jefferson Morley effuses about Blair's leadership, his 
ambition, his idealism, all the things Millar says he's lost.&nbsp; Morley 
oversells his case for &quot;Tony Blair, World President&quot; but at least 
he's been paying attention.&nbsp; Blair set the tone this week - I don't think 
the terrorists succeeded in wresting it away from him, although American cable 
news did its damnedest to let them yesterday - and for once he set it for 
something worth doing.</p> 
<p>Many of the journalists at Blair's post-summit press conference today 
expressed a palpable disappointment that the summit didn't accomplish more (the 
notable exception being the gossip-obsessed American - sigh).&nbsp; Most of 
them asked about the global warming part of the agenda, although more than a 
few were skeptical about the aid to Africa.&nbsp; Perhaps it isn't enough; 
personally, I'd like to seemore discussion about what the summit accomplished 
in terms of debt relief.&nbsp; But simply by raising the standards to the 
laudable goal of ending African poverty, Blair has raised our expectations for 
what our nations can and should do - unlike his American pal, who's lowered 
them so far that I briefly mistook his admission that global warming is a 
man-made problem for a major achievement and not a belated statement of the 
obvious.</p> 
<p>Blair and the protesters that Millar attempts to juxtapose so poignantly 
against him are working two different but crucially complementary approaches 
towards the same goal.&nbsp; The past six years of protests have pushed the 
issues of debt relief and global justice literally to the top of the world 
agenda; Blair, to his credit, has worked to see that something tangible comes 
out of that push, although he should by no means stop with the promises that 
were made this week.&nbsp; It may not be enough for some people; in the end it 
may not be enough for me.&nbsp; But it's almost enough to make me like Tony 
Blair.</p>

<h2>July 04, 2005</h2> 
<h3>S for Symbol</h3> 
<p>Last month I joined Amnesty International.&nbsp; I probably should have 
done it long ago, but I never quite got around to it until after they released 
theirreport condemning in unflinching detail my government's torture and abuse 
of detainees around the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually, it was the manufactured, 
shoot-the-messenger furor following the release of that report that finally got 
me to send in my money; I hope Amnesty's willingness to do the right thing and 
speak out against torture even in the face of such withering (and appalling) 
hostility and denial earned them many more new members.</p> 
<p>A few weeks later they sent me a letter asking me to contribute more money 
to theirUrgent Action Network, which sends appeals on behalf of prisoners of 
conscience around the world.&nbsp; In addition to asking for a donation, they 
included a small card - I'm sorry, a &quot;Message of Hope&quot; card - which 
they asked me to sign and return with the promise that they'd try to deliver it 
to a prisoner.&nbsp; It says simply &quot;Do not be discouraged.&nbsp; You are 
not forgotten&quot; in five languages.</p> 
<p>It's been sitting untouched on my desk ever since.&nbsp; I can't help it; 
I'm skeptical of calls to action that appear to be nothing more than symbolic 
gestures.&nbsp; What is the card really supposed to do?&nbsp; Is it just a way 
of making members feel involved in Amnesty's work?&nbsp; Is it the bait to reel 
in the contributions, which conceivably do more good than the cards?&nbsp; 
What's the point?</p> 
<p>This week, of course, all the cool boys are mocking the Live 8 concerts, 
which had the double gall of dusting off aging rock stars and attempting a mass 
political intervention in the upcoming G-8 summit.&nbsp; The concerts, the 
London one in particular, really did look like rock's last hurrah, one final 
albeit impressive manifestation of the revolutionary liberation that was always 
inchoate but never quite realized in its glory days.&nbsp; It was a broadcast 
from some parallel universe where rock stars do this sort of thing every summer 
and Yoko Ono never sold her dead husband's songs to Nike - interspersed with 
transmissions from our own Philadelphian timeline, where hip-hop superstars 
talk about helping Africa while wearing diamonds.</p> 
<p>So there was a certain undeniable grandiosity to the proceedings, but 
grandiosity - hell, pomposity - for a good cause is better than invoking 
cynicism or derision as a safe, comforting, morally superior alternative to 
action, and that's exactly where many of the Live 8 criticisms have been 
pitched from.&nbsp; But I have to admit, lambasting a campaign for debt relief 
because you don't care for Pink Floyd isn't so dissimilar from my reaction to 
the Message of Hope, which is as much a recoiling from the style, from the 
unbounded intimacy with strangers, from the<em>name</em> as it is a reasoned 
doubt about the little card's practical effects.</p> 
<p>And then somehow I always end up thinking about the graphic novel and 
soon-to-be-a-major-motion-picture<em>V for Vendetta. </em>This recent discussion
 over at the Howling Curmudgeons first sparked my thoughts about the 
sixteen-year-old comic in relation to the Amnesty card and our government's 
torture practices.</p> 
<p>Towards the end of Book 2 the jailed and tortured Evey Hammond receives a 
strikingly similar message of hope.&nbsp; (Speaking of whom, it was rather 
disconcerting to see Natalie Portman at Live 8, addressing this mass political 
mobilization while sporting Evey's shaved head. I kept waiting for Big Ben to 
explode.)&nbsp; It's written by a fellow prisoner from the next cell over (in a 
sense), not a well-meaning charity donor who sits in provisional freedom 
halfway around the world, and it's scrawled on toilet paper rather than 
eco-friendly recycled paper stock.&nbsp; It's the story of a woman who is 
arrested for being lesbian, who has her head shoved in a toilet bowl - at least 
there's no waterboarding, eh? - who is finally subjected to fatal medical 
experimentation, and who writes a testimony that inspires at least two other 
prisoners not to give in to the dehumanizations inflicted upon them by their 
captors.&nbsp; In fact, it leads to the destruction of the government that 
tortures and kills her.</p> 
<p>It's the moral center of a book that compromises every other moral stance, 
including the stance of inaction, and one of the most memorable passages in a 
book that does not lack for quotable quotes.&nbsp; When I was 18 I was more 
likely to find a slogan in V's all-but-final words (&quot;Ideas are 
bulletproof&quot;).&nbsp; And any number of lines are creepily appropriate 
today; V's injunction to Lewis Prothero (&quot;Admirable concern, 
commander.&nbsp; Yet it's deuced odd, isn't it?&nbsp; How you can show so much 
concern for porcelain and plastic... and show so little for flesh and 
blood&quot;) seems all too applicable to those who can get worked into a lather 
over analogies about torture or representations of torture but don't have any 
outrage to spare for the<em>actual torture</em>.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>But the more I read <em>V for Vendetta</em>, the more I realize that every 
other cool-sounding Alan Moore action-movie line - everything V says or does, 
for good or ill - is set into motion by Valerie's letter.&nbsp; It ends with a 
simple assertion of her and her fellow prisoners' worth as human beings, and 
their refusal to surrender that worth to their captors:</p> 
<p></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I don't know who you are, or whether you're a man or a woman.&nbsp; I may 
never see you.&nbsp; I will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with 
you.&nbsp; But I love you.&nbsp; I hope that you escape this place.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Do not be discouraged.&nbsp; You are not forgotten.&nbsp; From the filth of 
the &quot;fraternity pranks,&quot; Valerie creates real human fraternity.&nbsp; 
An Amnesty note that included selected portions of her letter would be truly 
inspirational - but Moore doesn't own those words anymore, and besides, the 
thought of sending real political prisoners letters of encouragement penned by 
fictional characters is unspeakably depressing.</p> 
<p>But they are a reminder that even the simplest words of support can have a 
profound impact.&nbsp; So can all those gauche public declarations and protests 
and grandiose message concerts, whose main purpose has always been to remind 
people at home that they're not the only ones who feel something isn't 
right.&nbsp; Six years ago debt relief was supposed to be a pipe dream, 
something only the fringes cared about; now it isn't so fringe or so 
unrealistic.</p> 
<p>When Moore's words are written up there, pulled out of their emotional 
context, they can look just as maudlin as any rock-concert Message of 
Hope.&nbsp; Maybe genuine conviction always does, especially in contrast to the 
no-risk variety of the cynic.&nbsp; But style and aesthetics and a lingering 
adolescent concept of cool are horrible reasons not to take part in a just 
cause.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The card and the check go out in the mail tomorrow.&nbsp; What else can I 
do?</p>

<h2>June 21, 2005</h2> 
<h3>Four Soldiers</h3> 
<p><strong><em>Seven Soldiers</em></strong> is Grant Morrison&rsquo;s latest 
project, a massive thirty-part storyline comprised of seven linked miniseries 
and two bookends.&nbsp; Now just over one-quarter completed, with four of the 
miniseries at their halfway points, the project has built up enough of a 
critical mass that some of its intersections and larger preoccupations are 
starting to become apparent.</p> 
<p>But who am I kidding?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been running for four months now; 
anybody who&rsquo;s still interested in reading this post probably 
doesn&rsquo;t need the introduction.&nbsp; This is both the blessing and the 
curse of jumping in late in the game, so I&rsquo;m going to dispense with the 
summaries and jump straight into my comments.&nbsp; But just in case you 
haven&rsquo;t read them already, spoilers follow for all of the series.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Seven Soldiers Special #0</strong></em>:&nbsp; This bookend 
special sports typically accomplished art by J. H. Williams III, who adapts 
himself perfectly to Morrison&rsquo;s metatextual style by drawing in a 
pastiche that ranges from Frank Miller gritty urban vigilante to John Severin 
western.&nbsp; I also wonder if the jagged cascades of the opening pages 
aren&rsquo;t a visual quotation of vintage Bissette/Totleben<em>Swamp Thing</em>
; the script references a later<em>Swamp Thing</em> issue, a deliciously nasty 
little Solomon Grundy story from Mark Millar&rsquo;s run on the title.</p> 
<p>Actually, <em>Swamp Thing</em> seems to pop up all over this project, and 
not just as the one notable source for continuity in a crossover that otherwise 
is perfectly happy to play fast and loose with history.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also 
relevant as a guide for revamping characters.&nbsp; &quot;The Anatomy 
Lesson&quot; is comics&rsquo; most successful reinvention, one that indirectly 
spawned an entire publishing line and a new direction in comics 
scripting:&nbsp; in other words, it unintentionally accomplished what Morrison 
is perhaps trying to do with Seven Soldiers.&nbsp; And so echoes of those old 
Moore<em>Swamp Thing</em>s will resurface throughout the narrative, possibly as 
reminders of how to remake company-owned superheroes without forsaking any of 
their outr&eacute; elements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The more violent, earthbound revamps of the eighties are exhausted and 
rejected by the Whip in her opening scene - &quot;I&rsquo;ve taken this whole 
morally ambiguous urban vigilante thing about as far as I can.&nbsp; And now, 
God help me, I want to visit other planets and dimensions and fight rogue 
gods&quot; - and both she and Morrison are looking for other options.&nbsp; 
Morrison finds them in the Seven Unknown Men, who appear to be agents of 
retcon, in-story explanations for the changes he is about to unleash.&nbsp; One 
of them tells the Spider, &quot;You shouldn&rsquo;t be seeing any of this, but 
sometimes, in an emergency like this one, we have to let you locals into one or 
two of our secrets.&quot;&nbsp; And so the Spider is ushered behind the scenery 
to witness his own renovation, just like the beginning of another Moore series,
<em>Supreme</em>.</p> 
<p>As for the Whip, well, she gets her wish, too, to her regret.&nbsp; The end 
to this first special is shocking not because so many of the protagonists die - 
we&rsquo;ve all seen plenty of that before - but because of the Whip&rsquo;s 
expression of sheer madness and terror at the end.&nbsp; Superheroes die all 
the time, but<em>they aren&rsquo;t supposed to lose their shit!</em>&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m hoping (possibly against all odds) that at least some of these 
characters survive their apparent end; their hooks, especially the 
Whip&rsquo;s, are too good to lose. In any case, the issue culminates with a 
bunch of superheroes (or superhero imitators) utterly failing in their mission 
&ndash; Morrison makes it clear that a different kind of hero will be needed.
</p> 
<p><em><strong>Shining Knight</strong></em>:&nbsp; Unlike most of the other 
Seven Soldiers series this one doesn&rsquo;t reach a stopping point with the 
second issue, taking a comparatively lackadaisical four issues to tell a 
complete story.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been great so far, with lush art by Simone 
Bianchi, but the half-finished plot means there&rsquo;s less to discuss.&nbsp; 
I can say that Morrison&rsquo;s scripting is excellent, whether he&rsquo;s 
writing Sir Justin&rsquo;s dialogue in almost-understandable mock Celtic (<em>
another</em> Moore hallmark, reminiscent of the Rannian language he invented for
<em>Swamp Thing</em>) or transliterating it into English for us.&nbsp; 
Morrison&rsquo;s Celtic/English fusions are strangely pregnant with sinister 
meaning; my favorite so far is the name for Gloriana Tenebrae&rsquo;s home, 
&quot;Unwhen,&quot; which connotes both Annwn, the Celtic land of the dead, and 
Justin&rsquo;s time-traveling ordeals.&nbsp; All in all I&rsquo;m more 
interested in Morrison&rsquo;s dark-fantasy take on the Camelot mythology than 
the fish-out-of-water time travel story, but we&rsquo;ll see where this leads.
</p> 
<p><strong><em>Guardian</em></strong>:&nbsp; The most accessible series for 
fans of standard superhero comics, although it works an odd twist on its 
inspiration.&nbsp; Morrison has updated the superficial trappings of the 
Guardian and the Newsboy Legion for an age of private security forces, tabloid 
journalism, and online news, but at its heart this is fundamentally a Kirby 
comic.</p> 
<p>Not the Simon/Kirby feel of the original Guardian, though, nor the 70s 
Kirby of Cadmus and Jimmy Olsen, but the 1960s Marvel Lee/Kirby at their 
prime.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s offered a rollicking story about angry golems and 
subway pirates, albeit with a tragic undercurrent that&rsquo;s never far from 
the surface.&nbsp; More tragic than the typical redemptive deaths of Stan Lee - 
this is a world where innocent people sometimes die for no reason. But the 
second issue closes with a lovely little moral-cum-exegesis that captures the 
feel and summarizes the ethos of the old Marvel at its most grandiose:&nbsp; 
&quot;We&rsquo;re telling stories about human dignity, Jake.&nbsp; Stories of 
how human beings make culture and meaning for ourselves, even down there in the 
garbage.&quot;&nbsp; Or in the Bullpen?</p> 
<p><strong><em>Zatanna</em></strong>:&nbsp; A lot has been written about this 
series&rsquo; apparent response to Moore&rsquo;s<em>Promethea</em>, and the 
similarities aren&rsquo;t exactly subtle.&nbsp; Both comics feature female 
protagonists who venture into dimensions of &quot;crystallized thought&quot; 
and imagination given form; both of those protagonists lecture the readers on 
magic.</p> 
<p>But most of the criticisms of this series stem from one line near the end 
of the first issue, where a would-be sorceror&rsquo;s apprentice tells Zatanna, 
&quot;I love the way you write about magic.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so, like, 
down-to-earth and non-preachy.&quot;&nbsp; Presumably this is meant to contrast 
Morrison&rsquo;s writing on magic with Moore&rsquo;s, a contrast that 
didn&rsquo;t endear Morrison to anyone despite<em>Promethea</em>&rsquo;s 
lackluster ending.</p> 
<p>What interests me is that while <em>Zatanna</em> chastises <em>Promethea
</em> it&rsquo;s also restaging, you guessed it, <em>Swamp Thing</em> - 
dragging Moore back to his roots, as it were.&nbsp; Morrison revisits the 
climactic chapter of &quot;American Gothic&quot;, quoting a line of dialogue, 
duplicating its setting in Baron Winter&rsquo;s home, and repeating its 
fatalities.&nbsp; If there is a criticism of Moore here it&rsquo;s done by 
paying homage to his older material while snubbing the new.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
always thought Morrison had the most interesting anxiety of influence vis-a-vis 
Moore of anyone in comics (certainly moreso than that faithful but pale 
imitator, Neil Gaiman);<em>Zatanna</em> offers plenty more fodder for it.</p> 
<p>The second issue has been much better received, partially because it 
contains no self-aggrandizing comparisons, though it quietly delivers on the 
promise of Misty&rsquo;s comments in the first one.&nbsp; Zatanna gives Misty a 
lecture/demonstration of magical technique and legerdemain,<em>demonstration
</em> being exactly what was missing from so many of those <em>Promethea</em> 
issues.&nbsp; Morrison&rsquo;s lessons are simpler - though also more 
appropriate for the character, given her background in stage magic - but he 
encodes them in plot and action, drastically curtailing the didacticism.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s less theologically ambitious but more narratively satisfying (and 
depending on who you ask,<em>both</em> of those may be good things).</p> 
<p>All magical business aside, <em>Zatanna</em> is the Seven Soldiers series 
most tied to its character&rsquo;s pre-Morrison history.&nbsp; The revisions 
are limited to Zatanna&rsquo;s costume, which gets a minor, faintly gothy 
redesign through the simple addition of garters and fingerless fishnet gloves.
&nbsp;The garters are almost too much, utterly exploding the plausible 
deniability that lets readers pretend superheroines aren&rsquo;t sex 
objects.&nbsp; (The Whip&rsquo;s fetish outfit in<em>Seven Soldiers</em> #0 
does much the same.)&nbsp; Morrison is so smitten with this new look that he 
has one of the other characters tell Zatanna it&rsquo;s sensational; normally I 
hate that sort of thing, but damn it, he&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; The costume 
displays Morrison&rsquo;s admirable knack for finding a concept&rsquo;s core 
appeal and unabashedly amplifying it.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Klarion the Witch Boy</strong></em>:&nbsp; The most untapped 
potential, with a fascinating world it barely explores.&nbsp; I was fully 
prepared, until I reread these issues, to say that Morrison&rsquo;s 
much-vaunted &ldquo;supercompressed&rdquo; pacing is sometimes a little<em>too
</em> compressed &ndash; a complaint I never thought I&rsquo;d make in this age 
of attenuated six-part arcs gasping out their two-issue plot for the trade 
paperback.&nbsp; One of the weaknesses of <em>Klarion</em>, and to a lesser 
extent of Seven Soldiers in general, is that Morrison throws out concepts so 
quickly he doesn&rsquo;t have time to develop them all; some good ones die on 
the vine.</p> 
<p>For example, I was surprised that we never actually see the High Market of 
Vanity Fair in<em>Klarion</em>, especially after all the build-up; it would 
make the perfect way station between Klarion&rsquo;s underground 
civilization/penal colony and the fabled homeland of Blue Rafters, which could 
sensibly be reserved for the final issue.&nbsp; Instead we skip it entirely. 
(This presumes Morrison isn&rsquo;t saving the market for some later Seven 
Soldiers issue.)&nbsp;<em>Klarion</em> has the richest and strangest terrain of 
any of the series thus far, and I wish he had given us more time to explore it.
</p> 
<p>But some of the details I thought were missing turn out to be there after 
all, lurking in the compression and waiting for later issues to explain them.
&nbsp;After the first issue, I had thought the clash between the 
Witch-men&rsquo;s Parliament and the Submissionaries was more explained than 
shown, and ended before it had been given a chance to develop.</p> 
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not so sure.&nbsp; We know the Witch-men are initiated with a 
trip beyond the Wicket Gate to see the god Croatoan and &quot;find out the sad, 
miraculous truth behind all the old stories.&quot;&nbsp; Their new Parliament 
threatens the Submissionaries, who want to keep the town safe and pure by 
sealing it off from the upper world, who interpret orders from Croatoan by 
staining the iron pages of his book with their own blood, who rule through the 
fear of outside enemies and the fear of their god.&nbsp; Obviously a commentary 
on the fundamentalists who attacked America and the fundamentalists who run it 
(though it&rsquo;s leaps and bounds more effective than the Iraq commentary in 
something like Phil Jiminez&rsquo;s<em>The Return of Donna Troy</em>, proof 
that sometimes agreeing with the politics just isn&rsquo;t enough).</p> 
<p>But this conflict deepens once we read the second issue and discover the 
big secret, the thing that has the Witch-men inventing democracies and steam 
engines and the Submissionaries closing the gates:&nbsp; Croatoan is gone, and 
the Witch-men know it.&nbsp; Suddenly Klarion&rsquo;s society seems much more 
carefully developed, if only glimpsed briefly, and<em>Klarion</em> itself seems 
less rushed than dense with meaning.</p> 
<p>Two other quick notes on <em>Klarion</em>, both trivial but both signs that 
I&rsquo;ve invested more time thinking about this series than any other. First,
Jog was right - that <em>really</em> needed to be a Twinkie wrapper.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s even called a &quot;cake of light,&quot; for God&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; 
If executed, this simple revision would allow Morrison to claim Seven Soldiers 
intersects with the entire Hostess advertisement<em>oeuvre</em> to form a 
multi-universal hypersigil, so you know he's up for it.</p> 
<p>But I have to take exception with Ebeneezer Badde:&nbsp; great foil for 
Klarion, horrible name, and what I can only assume is a reference to possibly 
the most precious single<em>of all time</em>, the Shamen's &quot;Ebeneezer 
Goode.&quot;&nbsp; I'll letSimon Reynolds explain:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>...the song anthropomorphized Ecstasy as a Dickensian scoundrel who always 
livens up the party.&nbsp; Despite a chorus of &quot;&lsquo;eezer Goode, 
&lsquo;eezer Goode&quot; that sounded suspiciously like advocacy (&quot;Es are 
good,&quot; get it?), the Shamen disingenuously insisted that the song 
wasn&rsquo;t about drugs at all.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>And you thought &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; was pretentious 
twee shit, didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Anyway, if Morrison is now naming characters 
&quot;&lsquo;eezer Badde&quot; then he&rsquo;s gone even more straight-edge 
than I&rsquo;d imagined.</p> 
<p><strong>Interconnections</strong>:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve resisted blogging about 
Seven Soldiers until now because if Morrison&rsquo;s pronouncements were 
accurate (and that is always a big<em>if</em>) much of its innovation was 
supposed to lie in the interconnections between the various series.&nbsp; The 
relatively flat reception of the first four issues wasn&rsquo;t surprising, 
given that at that stage the interconnections amounted to little more than a 
shared setting.&nbsp; (It also wasn't that surprising given the staggered 
bimonthly release of each of the series, which can&rsquo;t have been good for 
sales.)But now that they&rsquo;ve reached their halfway point it&rsquo;s become 
clear that not only are the individual series becoming more complex, the 
connections are increasing exponentially.</p> 
<p>Some of those connections are fairly shallow, just elements of a shared 
continuity:&nbsp; Klarion moving through the underground world shortly after 
the events of<em>Guardian</em> #2, Cassandra Craft revealing who the old man at 
the bus stop in<em>Shining Knight</em> was.&nbsp; Others are hidden jokes:&nbsp;
I guess now we know why Dyna-Mite Dan didn&rsquo;t do anything in the bookend 
if Cassandra has been selling forged TNT rings.&nbsp; Others are pure plot 
speculation:&nbsp; was that Zatara returning for his books?&nbsp; Has he become 
one of the Seven Unknown Men?&nbsp; Are all the Seven Unknown Men old, dead, or 
transcended superheroes/magicians like Ali ka-Zoom?</p> 
<p>But some of the intersections are starting to approach shared themes, ones 
that Morrison has enough subtlety to leave unspoken anywhere but the 
intersections.&nbsp; There are the fish out of water, strangers to the modern 
world (Shining Knight, Klarion); there are the abandoned children, searching 
for missing fathers or trying to complete their legacy (Klarion, Zatanna); 
there are the fallen heroes, looking for a second chance (Zatanna, Guardian, 
Shining Knight).&nbsp; Weirdest of all, in a project called Seven Soldiers, 
there are the sixes:&nbsp; groups of six heroes, abandoned by their sevenths, 
who meet terrible fates, and the strange dice that control fate, all that 
remains of the absent gods and Philosopher&rsquo;s Stones the characters seek.
&nbsp;The project has been built so much around absence, I wonder what Morrison 
is going to do when he finally starts that seventh miniseries.</p> 
<p>Dispersing themes across different stories may be an effective and 
enjoyable narrative tactic but, contra Morrison&rsquo;s own ceaseless hype, 
it&rsquo;s hardly innovative.&nbsp; It still remains to be seen if Seven 
Soldiers is going to amount to anything other than seven well-conceived 
character revisions, delivered through seven well-executed miniseries, and 
united to develop a few common ideas about power, authority, and heroism.</p> 
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that enough?</p>
