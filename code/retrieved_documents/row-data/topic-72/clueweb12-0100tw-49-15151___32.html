<p>They dress well, produce more than a thousand varieties of cheese, and have 
a former supermodel for a first lady. Now the French are better parents, too?
<br> <br>
 So claims Pamela Druckerman in her new book, &quot;Bringing Up Bebe
,&quot; the latest installment in the foreigners-are-better-parents genre. The 
book recounts Druckerman's personal experience raising kids in Paris and 
compares American parenting to the French model.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, we Yanks don't fare well.<br>
<br>
 French children, she 
claims, don't throw temper tantrums, play contentedly by themselves, and sit 
quietly at mealtime without throwing food. French parents achieve these and 
other impressive feats by establishing authority, setting firm boundaries and 
-- most importantly -- cultivating the invaluable attribute of patience.<br>

<br> She describes a virtual parenting utopia where mothers are calm and 
collected (not to mention well-dressed), obedient kids don't throw tantrums and 
parents are deeply satisfied with family life.<br>
<br>
 But does French-style 
parenting provide a truly enviable and replicable framework for American 
parents?<br>
<br>
 As an American mom raising my own children in Paris, I agree 
that the French do parent differently. Very differently. But the relevant 
question here is not<em>how</em> is it different but <em>why</em>?<br>
<br>
 
The answer is simple. Our two cultures value very different things. Where the 
French value tradition and solidarity, Americans value innovation and 
individuality. Where they seek to cultivate qualities of patience and 
intellectual uniformity we strive for entrepreneurialism and originality.<br>

<br> Our parenting styles serve different goals. So it should come as no 
surprise that we go about it in different ways.<br>
<br>
 From the first days 
at their kids' preschool through high-school graduation, American middle-class 
parents see our children as vessels of limitless potential. Given the right 
encouragement and opportunities, little Jack and Emma could grow up to be 
whatever they choose! So, we look for schools and activities that use the 
latest teaching models, employ the best teachers and most of all, praise, 
support, encourage! We hesitate to say &quot;no&quot; for fear (albeit somewhat 
absurdly) of crushing their little spirits and landing them, one day, on the 
therapist's couch.<br>
<br>
 In France? <em>Non</em>. French children go to 
school to be trained in the time-honored traditions and lessons of French 
society. French schoolchildren are not so much taught how to think as they are 
filled with knowledge. They succeed through memorization, competition and by 
giving the one (and only one) right answer.<br>
<br>
 Unlike in the U.S., 
academic success is still essential for professional excellence in France. 
Without the right degrees from the right schools, a French man or woman has 
little hope for a truly distinguished career. In the U.S., one can drop out, 
invent something in a garage, end up on the cover of<em>Time</em> magazine and 
even change the world.<br>
<br>
 Young teachers in France who try new methods 
are viewed with suspicion, not admiration. I was recently chatting with a group 
of French moms about a new teacher's approach at our kids' school. &quot;It's 
not the way we were taught,&quot; several of them said with alarm. It was 
therefore suspicious and unwelcome.<br>
<br>
 Parents in France are not invited 
to volunteer in the classroom and parent-teacher conferences happen by 
appointment. Even in the earliest grades, teachers are feared and classrooms 
are run with an almost militaristic precision. Fun isn't really part of the 
deal. Teachers teach, parents work, and kids play. Everyone has their own 
sphere and their own separate job to do.<br>
<br>
 French home life is like 
this, too -- structured and based on age-old models. Parents don't devour the 
latest parenting books (there aren't many) or rethink their approach to 
discipline in search of a better method. You're not going to catch a Parisian 
mother calling herself a &quot;bad mom&quot; because she forgot the snacks or 
didn't pack an extra diaper. In fact, she's not going to say it at all. It's 
just not French.<br>
<br>
 With their kids, the French deploy an authoritarian 
model based on respect for elders and upholding tradition. They use methods 
that many American middle-class parents today view as outmoded and even 
dangerous. Despite Ms. Druckerman's claims, most French parents I know 
consistently raise their voices (and even their hands) to their kids to teach 
them who is boss.<br>
<br>
 And while French children are often quite obedient 
in their parents' presence, their penchant for self-control diminishes quickly 
when they're away from mom and dad. I have watched many a<em>petit francais</em>
 go wild in my living room and respond to my admonishments with surprising 
defiance. American parents, however, often have the opposite experience: Our 
kids are angels at school and at friend's houses but become deaf mini-tyrants 
at home.<br>
<br>
 Ms. Druckerman goes on to cite studies that show French 
women report greater satisfaction with childcare than their American 
counterparts. But of course! Who wouldn't find parenting less stressful and 
more enjoyable in a culture that heaps benefits and assistance upon its parents 
and families?<br>
<br>
 She cites the relevance of these benefits but quickly 
shifts focus to our shared values of reading to our kids and exposing them to 
activities as evidence of common ground. But this misses the point. National 
support for mothers and families - of both the material and social variety - 
shapes the way we view our responsibilities as parents. Its impact on the 
culture of parenting cannot be overstated.<br>
<br>
 The French expect the 
state (through free, high-quality daycare, schools and healthcare) to offer a 
helping hand in raising their kids. They are shocked by the idea of exorbitant 
preschool tuition and the financial burden healthcare places on many American 
families. Most even receive a monthly cash per-child payment that increases for 
each additional child they have. Americans famously want their government to 
keep its hands off.<br>
<br>
 We therefore define &quot;good parenting&quot; in 
vastly different ways. A &quot;good mother&quot; in the U.S. (a virtually 
unattainable state of grace) is, by definition, a deeply involved and engaged 
mother. A sit-on-the-floor, clap your hands, dig in the sandbox, finger 
painting kind of gal.<br>
<br>
 Mothers I know in France simply do not do these 
things. This notion of motherhood strikes the French as patently absurd. This 
is what preschool and extracurricular activities are for. Self-sacrifice (like 
giving birth without an epidural or breastfeeding into toddlerhood) is seen not 
as a hallmark of a devoted mother but of an overly burdened woman who needs to 
get a life. Only about 55 percent of French women breastfeed at all and most 
wean their babies after three months.<br>
<br>
 French parents are not expected 
to abdicate their adult lives and ambitions in order to raise their children.
<em>Au contraire</em>: They continue to view themselves as adults with separate 
lives that do not revolve strictly around their children. As Ms. Druckerman 
correctly points out, the French rigorously guard adult time and space; hence 
no toys in the living room, no toddlers in the parent's bed.<br>
<br>
 So, 
before we abandon American parenting practices in favor of the French, we must 
ask ourselves what end we hope to achieve and what supports we're willing to 
put in place to help parents achieve it. Do we truly want to change the culture 
of American parenting? Then we must first be willing to change American culture 
itself.</p>  &nbsp; <br>

French. Remember when being a mom was as easy and as All-Americ&shy;an as apple 
pie? Oh wait, apple pie's not good for us anymore either. Thank god I still 
have my sense of humor. At least until someone says that Latvian or Albanian or

08:35 AM on 02/10/2012 I am an American mother of four boys all born and raised 
in Paris.<br>
<br>
 The contrast between French and American parenting led me 
to write a blog: Home Is Funwww.home-i&shy;s-fun.com because I heard too many 
French mom's scream at their kids in public. Of course they love their 
kids...it'&shy;s just hard to notice sometimes. &shy;..and they, like families 
of all nations, have moments when home is no fun at all.<br>
<br>
 Home Is Fun 
develops tools to help families put into practice their parenting strategies
&shy;. When I ask the French mom's what they hope for their kids, they come up 
with eloquent ideals. Then I inquire what they do on an everyday basis to 
develop these ideals, they respond, &quot;Mais, c'est une autre histoire!&quot; 
That's another story. One box for life strategies&shy;. A seperate box for 
daily life. Hum....<br>
<br>
 I've started doing workshops on &quot;How to Give 
Instructio&shy;ns so that Kids Want to Follow&quot; because the French moms 
begged me to do so! They want creativity and fun in their parenting. (By the 
way, there is no word for &quot;parenting&shy;&quot; in French. Some call it 
&quot;the art of being a parent&quot; Others also call it &quot;education
&shy;&quot; which is the same word Mrs. Druckerman used to translate 
&quot;disciplin&shy;e.&quot;) <br>

on 02/10/2012 Excellent analysis! There's another reason the french dont 
breastfeed beyond a few weeks or months at the most. The subject does not exist 
on the medical school cursus. Nothing. Not one course, one lesson, one 
discussion&shy;. Nothing. No pediatrici &shy;an has to go into the effects of 
HAMLET (the tumor killing effect) or the reason why longer is better. Not one 
scrap of informatio&shy;n in the 7 year program. In the most medicated country 
in europe, mothers rely on doctors for informatio&shy;n, and obviously dont get 
it. Anyone who breastfeed&shy;s for biological &shy;ly normal rates (The WHO 
and France {in one sentence at the end of the article} recommend 2 yrs minimum) 
do so strictly because they've done their own homework. Its a political choice. 
As the GDP stands currently, the fewer babies breastfed, the better the GDP 
does. Its strategic move to not train health profession&shy;als. <br>

 The WHO 
recommends breast milk as supplement&shy;ation, up to 24 months of age, based 
on the child's nutritiona&shy;l needs. Saying &quot;the WHO recommend breast

06:27 PM on 02/09/2012 Any of the readers who are of the baby boom age, can 
read the original article, and say, wow, that's how I was raised, with manners, 
not speaking over adults, having our afternoon snacks, etc. We were healthy, 
loved and cared for and not obese. It seemed we all turned out fine. The 
current batch of parents, including loads of baby boomers, lost their nerve to 
act the part of the parent, that is to say no, when you mean no. Love your 
kids, not idolize them, teach them manners and be the parent, not their friend. 
That can come when they are adults. Really people, its not that complicate
&shy;d, use some common sense.<br>

on 02/09/2012 When you look at young Americans, the drug use, the poverty, the 
behavior of the children under sixteen in America today and it is no wonder one 
and probably many more countries are ahead of us. My grown kids are not perfect 
but they have lives, good morals, do not use drugs, and work hard. They do not 
have the chances I did but that is because my generation had let special 
interests take over government and now it is all about &quot;me&quot; in this 
country and not &quot;we&quot; and fair chances. we need to start saying no, 
living within our means, and kicking credit cards and credit out of our lives.

 01:34 PM on 02/09/2012 One of the most important words in raising children is 
one that many of today's parents are for some reason reluctant to use: No. Not, 
&quot;No, because...&shy;&quot; Not, &quot;No, but...&quot; Just one simple, 
firm No. Yelling is unnecessar&shy;y. But once you have said it, you must 
follow through and not give in.<br>
<br>
 Another rule that I followed was 
never to threaten unless I was prepared to do whatever I threatened&shy;. I 
never said to my kids, &quot;If you do that again, I'm gonna kill you!&quot; 
Because if they had done it again, I'd have had to kill them.<br>
<br>
 These 
might not work for everyone, but they made my life a lot simpler, and I think 
it was also easier for my kids.  whatfreshhellisthis: One of the most important

explained it again when my son tried again (though I already had my hand to 
stop him). &nbsp;He looked at the man in front of him, and at me. &nbsp;I was 
not angry or threatenin&shy;g, and he was processing all this informatio 
&shy;n. &nbsp;I was not going to let him kick that seat, and I gave him the 
reason why.<br>
<br>
Now, kids can have trouble rememberin &shy;g. 
&nbsp;Getting busy paying attention to a snack I had given him, or a book I was 
reading to him, his legs might start to rise up. &nbsp;I stopped them; pointed 
-- no words needed now -- he looked at the top of the man's head and lowered 
his legs.<br>
<br>
Kids don't want to misbehave just for the sake of it. 
&nbsp;Unless they are starving for attention, but that's a different problem.
<br> <br>
But EVERYBODY deserves a reason for a rule.  CabinAgue: I always said 
&quot;No, because...&quot; -- I found my kids<br>

01:31 PM on 02/09/2012 Good article. And let's not forget &quot;love&quot;, 
love between the parents who more than likely sleep in the same bed with each 
other and not the children. Never underestim&shy;ate a happy love life when it 
comes to a happy family. If you do underestim&shy;ate it, then I'd imagine you 
don't have one.<br>

 Well isn't that special!!! Of course French parents are given in-home help by 
the government when they bring a new baby home. They also have &quot;free&quot; 
health care. So, while our parents are out here busting their @$$e$ to make 
ends meet and pay for things like health care, the French sit on their duffs 
sipping wine while the nanny handles the children! It's easier to be a 
disciplina&shy;rian when the child isn't yours but you're responsibl &shy;e for 
their behavior in order to keep your job!<br>
 Americans SMELL better than the 
French as we know how to bathe and use anti-persp&shy;iration and deodorizin 
&shy;g body products!<br>

 06:49 AM on 02/10/2012  You really have no idea what you are 
talking about. The French do not have gov't paid nannies who come into their 
home to take care of their children. They do have &quot;free&quot; preschool 
(starts at 3 years old) which is part of the education system This really isn't 
&quot;free&quot;....&shy;........th &shy;ey pay taxes for it. French parents 
are not sitting home sipping wine while someone else takes care of their 
children. They work hard and make less than the average American. You obviously 
have not been to France or know any French people if you think Americans smell 
better. The French bathe everyday and use deodorant just like Americans. The 
stereotype of the &quot;stinky French&quot; came from WWII and the liberation 
of Paris. You really should educate yourself before you make comments about 
things you have no knowledge of.<br>

01:25 PM on 02/11/2012 Agreed with 'Americane &shy;xpatineuro &shy;pe'. I've 
lived in France for 10 years. My son was born here. This was the most idiotic, 
insulting and uninformed post I've read in a long time. Excuse me while I go 
pass my son off to a nanny, while I sit around in my own stink, drinking wine 
and eating bonbons.<br>

 12:32 PM on 02/09/2012  Nearly every country on the planet is 
&quot;Better at Parenting&quot; that they U.S.<br>
<br>
 Why you ask? <br>
<br>

 Because parents spend time with their kids. They teach them how to read and 
write. How to think critically&shy;. How to get along with others, how to live 
their lives in a productive and successful manner that will help not only 
themselves but also the society they live in.<br>
<br>
 Just the fact of being 
with their kids and sharing time with them will teach the kids and help them 
grow into helpful, caring, and responsibl&shy;e adults <br>

every country on the planet is &quot;Better at Parenting&quot;<br>

AM on 02/09/2012 Lessee. France a country of 62 million people had 494 murders 
last year. Philadelph&shy;ia, a city of 1.4 million people will have close to 
that this year alone. One American city has as many murders as an entire 
country? Hmmm, somebody is doing something right over there at some level.<br>

 11:43 AM on 02/09/2012  France, also, is not a melting pot, like 
us, that hosts several cultures with different upbringing&shy;s. Different 
cultures are more, well, hostle, outspoken, regardless of public civility. Poor
