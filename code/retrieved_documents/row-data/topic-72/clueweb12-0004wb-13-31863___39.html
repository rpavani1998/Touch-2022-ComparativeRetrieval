<p>-- A new, official <strong>Food &amp; Beverage Recipe Request Form </strong>
was recently spotted in Disneyland and readers report that it's being used in 
Walt Disney World as well. The form has room for your name, email address or 
mailing address, and the recipe that you are requesting. The name of the 
restaurant in which you are making the request is already indicated on the 
paper. There is a disclaimer that recipes have been converted from large 
batches to small kitchen use and thus the flavor may not be exactly as you 
remembered. We've received feedback that people have been receiving recipes a 
few days after turning in these cards (which you can get from your server).</p> 
<p>-- Many <strong>gingerbread displays </strong>are now up in the deluxe Walt 
Disney World Resorts, like the Beach Club, Grand Floridian, and Contemporary. 
Joining this year's line-up is a new creation in the lobby of the BoardWalk 
Resort. The traditional gingerbread and chocolate gazebo is back, but now you 
can also see Stitch's Bakery Store Front, a miniature replica of the BoardWalk 
Bakery that Stitch has taken over (Lilo's there, too) -- 14 feet tall and 10 
feet wide. Disney cast members will be inside the creation decorating 
gingerbread houses. There's also a life-size gingerbread house at the American 
Adventure pavilion selling goodies again this year.</p> 
<p>-- The reopening date for the <strong>Yakitori House </strong> in Epcot's 
Japan Pavilion has been pushed back to December 16, 2011.</p> 
<p>-- The <strong>Diamond Horseshoe </strong> in the Magic Kingdom's

</strong></p> 
<p>-- As part of the ongoing refurbishment and expansion of Magic Kingdom's 
Fantasyland,<strong>Enchanted Grove </strong> has been transformed into the 
<strong>Cheshire Cafe. </strong> As you'll recall, this location is right next 
to the Mad Tea Party, so the Cheshire Cat tie-in does make a bit more sense. 
Changes include an updated facade, new paint, and new signage. The menu has 
remained the same (with prices going up slightly on several items).<br>
<br>
 --
<strong>Epcot's Rose and Crown </strong> was among the many restaurants 
changing up the menu in Walt Disney World this fall. Among other changes, the 
appetizer trio is now gone (though you can still get the scotch egg), and a new 
Pork Duo dish has been introduced. A seasonal vegetable curry is also new on 
the menu. As for desserts, the lemon pie is gone, but a new Irish 
Whiskey-Caramel creme brulee has been added. (We greatly enjoyed the Pork Duo.)
</p> 
<p>-- <strong>Sleepy Hollow </strong> in Magic Kingdom is welcoming menu 
changes as well. While the beloved homemade ice cream sandwich remains, the 
addition of three new<strong>waffle sandwiches </strong> is the big news. 
Choose from Sweet and Spicy Chicken, Nutella with Fresh Fruit, and Prosciutto 
with Tomatoes and Swiss. Sadly, the counter-service location bids farewell to 
the large Mickey-shaped waffle and the yummy chicken and wild rice soup.</p> 
<p>-- We received word this week that <strong> Disney's Hollywood Studios 
</strong> has changed the bread rolls served at table-service meals to a 
version that contains egg. This may cause problems for guests who follow a 
vegan diet and may affect other special diets. Be sure to ask about ingredients 
before you dig into that bread basket.</p> 
<p>-- <strong>Wolfgang Puck Cafe, Portobello, Raglan Road, and Fulton's Crab 
House in Downtown Disney</strong> have announced prix fixe Thanksgiving menus 
available next week. Be sure to make reservations through WDW-DINE if you'll be 
spending Turkey Day in Disney World.<br>
<br>
 -- <strong> Orlando's House of 
Blues</strong> will be introducing the new Crossroads at House of Blues menu by 
celebrity<strong>Chef Aaron Sanchez </strong> in December 2011. This new menu 
will keep some old favorites (like jambalaya), put a new spin on others (like 
the beloved cornbread), and add some entirely new dishes to the mix.</p>
