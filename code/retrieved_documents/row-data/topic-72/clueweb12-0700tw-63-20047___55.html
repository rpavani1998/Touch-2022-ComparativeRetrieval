<h2>Researching and Valuing an Antique &ndash; Unpuzzling the&nbsp;Past&hellip;
</h2> 
<p> Reblogged from The Difference Between A Duck:</p> 
<p> I&rsquo;m a romantic. I love stories and love wondering about the past and 
the objects that were there to witness it. Though I&rsquo;m not a true antique 
collector, it&rsquo;s hard to resist saving a quaint old treasure to find 
it&rsquo;s story. So I&rsquo;m researching a fold-up antique table I found at 
Goodwill for $3.99. I could tell it was antique, maybe mahogany, I don&rsquo;t 
know. Old craftsmanship for sure. Part of the furniture sticker was missing, so 
I could not see the whole company name. I finally figured out from 
someone&rsquo;s &hellip;</p>  Republished from my original post on my blog The

<h2>Brown Recluse&nbsp;Therapuetics&hellip;</h2> 
<p><em>This story, <em>originally published by me on March 3, 2010,</em> is 
republished from my blogThe Difference Between A Duck. </em></p> 
<p>Today was warm and beautiful outdoors.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had a green 
thumb &ndash; in fact it&rsquo;s generally what I&rsquo;d consider brown.&nbsp; 
But enticed by the fresh air and clear skies, I headed outdoors to work on my 
back yard.</p> 
<p>Mainly, there was a lot of trimming and raking to be done.&nbsp; I hear 
there are all sorts of trimming rules for the health of your bushes and trees, 
but I know none of these things.&nbsp; However, I wish to entertain with a cook 
out, and to clean things up.&nbsp; And I haven&rsquo;t ventured out to maintain 
anything back there in months.&nbsp; So I did it the slow way &ndash; trimmed 
around, stepped back to look, placed chairs, stepped back to look, trimmed some 
more, tried to reach here and there, until it looked ok.&nbsp; I think.</p> 
<p>I should have used gloves though.&nbsp; My hands are very sore.&nbsp; And 
the loppers we have are bent, so their work wasn&rsquo;t the finest nor 
quickest, nor for that matter, painless.&nbsp; Still, the back yard does look 
better.</p> 
<p>As I uncovered stones and timbers while removing old leaves, various 
spiders scurried about.&nbsp; And I was reminded of my childhood down at my 
father&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; And the wars I fought against the brown recluse 
invasion there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t generally believe in killing spiders, save 
the dangerous ones.</p> 
<p>It was years before my Dad realized I was telling him the truth about the 
poisonous spiders I worked around in the wood room.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t just 
being a scared little girl after all.&nbsp; And by then, of course, I&rsquo;d 
learned to cope with my circumstances &ndash; by hunting them.&nbsp; By knowing 
their habits and every move. And by catching them in jars in case someone would 
finally notice not only the markings, but the numbers.</p> 
<p>I was the only one in the family who not only didn&rsquo;t wear glasses, 
but had eyes that tested better than the norm.&nbsp; Details were obvious to me 
in an instant from any distance.&nbsp; Though perhaps sometimes a curse.&nbsp; 
I could see things that others could not.&nbsp; It is sad to me that today I 
should wear weak glasses while working on my projects, not because I 
can&rsquo;t see them, but because my eyes do not adjust from close to far as 
quickly anymore. They tell me the cones are aging.&nbsp; And I still test 
better than 20/20.&nbsp; What a strange circumstance for me.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s my guess that the sheer numbers of recluses at the shop caused 
them to be less reclusive than &ldquo;experts&rdquo; claim them to be.&nbsp; I 
wonder how many experts have worked in a building practically owned by a 
recluse &ldquo;clan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though that makes them sound friendlier to 
family than they really are.</p> 
<p>I turned over a rock in my backyard.&nbsp; Sure enough, there was the 
tunnel in the groove and the tell-tale hunched body with the sand-dollar shaped 
back and famous &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; back shape.&nbsp; When they are surprised 
like this, they hunch and hesitate like a cat before they spring or run.&nbsp; 
As if to decide which choice to make.&nbsp; But even so, the process is very, 
very quick.&nbsp; Micro-seconds at best.&nbsp; And in spite of their reclusive 
nature, when disturbed they have no fear. If you are in their territory, all 
bets are off.&nbsp; They do not hold back.</p> 
<p>For but an instant, memories flood back to me of flipping timbers outside 
the wood shop, hunting for the spiders and egg sacks I knew would be 
there.&nbsp; Every week, killing every one, because their numbers were growing 
and the docile native wood spiders were nearly gone.&nbsp; Recluses were taking 
over the place, killing off all the rest and no one believed me.&nbsp; Then<em>
<strong>the</strong></em> memory washes over me.</p> 
<p>Flipping a timber &ndash; you had to be quick&nbsp; &ndash; and I was an 
expert by then.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t flip a timber slowly when you know 
it&rsquo;s the home of an average of 4-6 recluses each,<em>that you can see on 
the outside</em>.&nbsp; And there were many timbers lined in front of 
Dad&rsquo;s wood-shop and storage shed for parking.&nbsp; Your movement must be 
quick and you barely touch the timber when you execute.</p> 
<p>But this one time, one of <em>them </em>was quicker than lightning.&nbsp; 
As if it knew exactly what I was doing and exactly what would happen.&nbsp; 
Remember Arachnophobia?&nbsp; The demon soldier spider predicting every 
move?&nbsp; When I saw that comedy, I immediately identified with that 
detail.&nbsp; The timber flipped and it was on me in the same instant.&nbsp; 
Racing up my arm.&nbsp; It was an old one &ndash; big and quick.&nbsp; The old 
ones were the only ones who managed to survive my jars.&nbsp; Put a bunch of 
brown recluses together in a jar and soon there is only one left alive.&nbsp; 
The biggest one.&nbsp; They are extremely resistant to all poisons, except 
their own.&nbsp; I never touch them, even when dead.&nbsp; And here was a 
healthy one with strong markings &ndash; racing up my bare arm.&nbsp; The image 
has been frozen with me ever since.</p> 
<p>As quickly as it was on, I swiped my hand down my arm and flung it into the 
grass away from me.&nbsp; Danced back and then pounced and crushed it under my 
shoe.&nbsp; It was some time before I stopped trembling.&nbsp; And at the same 
time, it was empowering: escaping the brown recluse bite.</p> 
<p>Today I eye the quite small recluse under my stone.&nbsp; Not old like the 
big ones back home.&nbsp; It hunches.&nbsp; In the same second I crush 
it.&nbsp; As easily today as a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<h2>The Top Eight Things That Tick Me&nbsp;Off&hellip;</h2> 
<p><em>This article was originally published on my blog The Difference Between 
A Duck on May 5, 2010.</em></p> 
<p>Dan Rockwell over at Leadership Freak asked a potent question on his blog 
this morning:&nbsp; What ticks you off as a leader?&nbsp; And what ticks you 
off about leaders?&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an awesome question with a lot of 
answers.&nbsp; I find his daily blogs to be thought provoking and 
succinct.&nbsp;You might check it out.</p> 
<p>I work long hours in the volunteer world where you often learn a 
person&rsquo;s true caliber.&nbsp; There are times the drama really<strong>
ticks me off</strong>.</p> 
<p><em>So with the encouragement to take a day and have a healthy rant&hellip;
</em><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>H</strong><strong>ere are my top eight things that tick me off.
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>1) Don&rsquo;t Lie</strong> &ndash; Those who claim credentials and 
experience they don&rsquo;t really have. A PhD and a DD are not the same thing. 
Nor are a myriad of other credentials alike.&nbsp; This also goes for those who 
claim illness or tragedy they&rsquo;ve never experienced too.</p> 
<p><strong>2) Know Your Limits </strong>&ndash; Those who refuse assistance 
when they are running behind, &ldquo;no I&rsquo;ve got it&rdquo; and then 
ultimately fail the deadline or project altogether when it could have been 
fixed if they had accepted help (or delegation) when offered.</p> 
<p><strong>3) Know Your Facts</strong> &ndash; Articles, reports and claims 
promoted arbitrarily as fact and w/o references or proof. 
&ldquo;Statistics&rdquo; that have no source. Using the phrase &ldquo;we do it 
all the time&rdquo; as proof that something works, is main stream, or should 
continue to be allowed, etc. (and gripes me even further when once or twice in 
reality becomes &ldquo;all the time&rdquo; in a debate).&nbsp; Then there are 
those brand newbies who do the opposite arbitrary claim &ldquo;it obviously 
wasn&rsquo;t working&rdquo; to justify disrespect to loyal employees and a 
complete policy make-over, when the claim is simply untrue, illogical and 
unsupported by any research or facts.</p> 
<p><strong>4) Embrace Maturity</strong> &ndash; Drama in a professional 
environment drives me crazy, along with those who would rather start WWIII than 
accept criticism, difference of views or simply admit &ldquo;Ok this could have 
been better.&rdquo; Those who are more concerned with &ldquo;winning&rdquo; an 
argument than taking care of a customer.&nbsp; This also includes taking things 
personally for no apparent logical or professional reason.&nbsp; More time is 
wasted trying to undo assumptions made about non-existent intent.&nbsp; Really, 
it&rsquo;s not all about you.</p> 
<p><strong>5) Communicate</strong> &ndash; Leaders who fail to communicate and 
then suddenly freak-out and look for the nearest scape-goat.&nbsp; On the other 
side, leaders who don&rsquo;t know how to deal with a situation or person, so 
they literally hide from them. That would go for volunteers/employees too. You 
don&rsquo;t have to be a naturally great communicator, just at least try!</p> 
<p><strong>6) Listen</strong> &ndash; Not reading emails/reports even when 
they are simple bullet points and then having to email/call them again and 
again.&nbsp; Refusing to take phone calls.&nbsp; Not asking questions.&nbsp; 
Assuming without logic or basis.</p> 
<p><strong>7) Be Responsible</strong> &ndash; Own and take credit for mistakes 
as much as successes. It&rsquo;s part of life.</p> 
<p><strong>8 ) Armchair Quarterbacks</strong> &ndash; Those who sign up to 
volunteer, can&rsquo;t be reached when it&rsquo;s time to work, and then 
complain about how things were done.&nbsp; That would also include those who 
sign up, can&rsquo;t be reached when it&rsquo;s time to work, and then take 
credit for being there when they weren&rsquo;t, knowing people they 
don&rsquo;t, doing things they didn&rsquo;t and including it on a resume or in 
a job interview.</p> 
<p><strong>So what about you?&nbsp; What really ticks you off as a leader? 
</strong></p> 
<p><em>Thanks again for the therapeutic whine Dan&hellip;&hellip;!</em></p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t Pin Me Bro! The Saga Of Copyright and&nbsp;Pinterest</h2> 
<h2>Pinterest</h2> 
<p>Like Twitter and Facebook, Pinterest is a social media concept that&rsquo;s 
compelling by nature and has quickly taken the social community by storm.&nbsp; 
And it&rsquo;s easy to see why.</p> 
<p>Pinterest is a concept of &ldquo;pinning&rdquo; your favorite interesting 
photos found across the internet, to a virtual bulletin board, complete with 
categories and descriptions for content.&nbsp; In essence it is a virtual 
visual collection much like a wish list, or even a dream orvision board.&nbsp; 
Only you can have several boards all hosted on Pinterest.</p> 
<p>Have an interest in Dr. Who like I do?&nbsp; You can create a board there 
to pin your favorite photos of Daleks and actors, the electronic screwdriver 
you want for Christmas and even theTardis Kindle Cover I pinned and later 
received for Valentine&rsquo;s Day (my hubby is the best!).&nbsp; And the cool 
thing?&nbsp; When you pin, Pinterest links that photo &ldquo;pin&rdquo; 
directly to the site you pin from. From there your friends and followers can 
also &ldquo;re-pin&rdquo; the photo to their boards, link intact.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s a great visual way to share with others.&nbsp; A lot of words 
aren&rsquo;t necessary when a picture paints a thousand words.</p> 
<p>Btw, you can view my Pinterest boards here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m slow to adding 
to my pins and follows, as I try to do so with purpose.&nbsp; Ever since 
reading Forbes&rsquo; article about the potential costs caused bydigital 
hoarding, I&rsquo;ve looked at collecting a whole new way.&nbsp; <em>But 
that&rsquo;s another story for another time.</em></p> 
<p>As it is with most social things, I first heard about Pinterest from a 
friend.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to think of it at first, but I&rsquo;m 
pretty darn sure now that there can be some marketing aspects to it.&nbsp; And 
only a week ago,&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal seems to agree.&nbsp; I finally 
joined because I kept seeing referral hits on my blog from Pinterest and 
I&rsquo;m pretty sure at least one pattern sale this month originated from that 
direction as well. I&rsquo;ve also found it&rsquo;s a great way to find more 
things in genres I love, like Dr. Who, Steam Punk, etc.. The kind of things 
that pretty much it takes one to pass it on to find, but Googling might not 
discover.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems more efficient thanStumbleUpon.&nbsp; Being 
very visual in nature, the platform is perfect for collecting visual 
experiences that only a photo can describe.&nbsp; I am sent photos over the 
internet nearly every day in one inspirational Power Point presentation or 
another means.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d far rather be tagged on Pinterest and know where 
the photo came from.</p> 
<h2>What About Copyright Issues?</h2> 
<p>Along with the pioneering spirit of Pinterest&rsquo;s visual landscape, 
though, copyright controversy has also been in the air.&nbsp; There have been 
complaints from image owners who don&rsquo;t want their images being pinned and 
don&rsquo;t know how to stop the frenzy.&nbsp; ManyEtsy sellers are included in 
this lot.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some sellers have even found their for-sale 
items pinned to boards with descriptions like, &ldquo;$60 is too much! I want 
to figure out how to copy this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not to mention the on-going 
concerns many photographers have.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s disconcerting to go through. Sellers are trying to make an extra 
income. Some Etsy folks are there because they lost jobs, or need a second 
income. Some are there because they were die-hard makers to begin with. I know 
we can totally appreciate their plight. No one likes to feel victimized. 
Everyone desires respect and professional courtesy. No one wants to lose money 
or have their ideas swiped. And it&rsquo;s a bit of a poor show for someone to 
pin a seller&rsquo;s item with a blatant stated intention of copying.</p> 
<p>To add fuel to the gathering flames, just last Friday, Galen Moore wrote 
his article &ldquo;How Your Business Could Get Sued Using Pinterest&rdquo; for 
the Boston Business Journal.&nbsp; In it he explains a little known clause in 
Pinterest&rsquo;s user agreement that gives them the right to actually sell any 
image uploaded to their service.&nbsp; A clause many people probably never 
noticed.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And we could be liable for it. Eek! Really?
</p> 
<p>Also on the same day came Kevin Lincoln&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Pinterest 
Might Be Enabling Massive Copyright Theft&rdquo; for Business Insider.&nbsp; In 
that article Kevin interviews a media law attorney, Itai Maytal, on the 
matter.&nbsp; Along with the varying answers both grey and pointed, Mr. Maytal 
points out that the recent copyright concerns are likely to be an issue for
Tumblr as well.</p> 
<h2>Concerns Are Being Heard</h2> 
<p>There does seem to be some action being taken for folks who don&rsquo;t 
want their items to be pinned.&nbsp; Not unlike how photos on Flickr can be 
protected and how photos on Google image search can be removed.</p> 
<p>And Pinterest is no exception.&nbsp; They even wrote a blog article this 
week on the copyright subject.&nbsp; Seems they&rsquo;re listening and
they&rsquo;ve created a code you can put on your website to disable pinning
.&nbsp; Owners can also file copyright infringement complaints directly with 
Pinterest to have pins taken down.&nbsp;You can fill out that form here.</p> 
<p>Flickr, a photo hosting service, is also listening and jumping in to 
protect their users.&nbsp; Just yesterday they enabled protection for Flickr 
users from having their photos pinned.&nbsp;Check out yesterday&rsquo;s 
discussion on Flickr here.</p> 
<h2>Is This Much Different Than A Xerox Machine Though?</h2> 
<p>Many folks might remember though, this kind of thing isn&rsquo;t the first 
time new technology caused copyright concerns.&nbsp; The invention of the 
copy-machine came first.&nbsp; There was a lot of controversy over the ability 
to steal copyrighted material, and yet copy-machines are indispensable 
today.&nbsp; Read more about that history at &ldquo;Copyright And The Advent Of 
Xerox Machines,&rdquo; a great little article on the &ldquo;History of 
Information&rdquo; blog from Berkley.</p> 
<h2>Some Of My Thoughts, As A Seller &amp; Designer</h2> 
<p>Copyright protection is important.&nbsp; Seriously important.&nbsp; And for 
more reasons than just products and inventions.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want my 
children&rsquo;s photos, for instance, posted around the internet without 
permission either.&nbsp; An approach to the issue I haven&rsquo;t really heard 
much about and a subject for a different conversation.</p> 
<p>However, I think the truth is that with or without Pinterest, the copy-cats 
are there doing their thing anyway. In my experience, many may covet, but few 
truly act. (See my article &ldquo;When Artist&rsquo;s Hear, &lsquo;I Can Make 
That!&lsquo;&rdquo; for more.)&nbsp; And honestly, whose people aren&rsquo;t my 
market anyway. Services like Pinterest just make it easier to find out that 
someone<em>might</em> want to copy your work. People will do this sort of thing 
with or without help of services like Pinterest.</p> 
<p>Case in point: At a local juried show a few years ago, I had a woman come 
into my booth, handle/look at all my goods, ask questions, acted like she 
wanted to buy, let me talk to her about my hooks and methods, etc..&nbsp; After 
much conversation and time, she then walked out of my booth with these words 
over her shoulder, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought about making these kinds of 
things to sell in my booth! I&rsquo;ll have to think about it and make some 
now.&rdquo; She then proceeded to walk back to her booth on the opposite side 
of the show.</p> 
<p>I was completely disarmed. Usually, rather exclusive juried shows include 
better vendors and behavior than that.&nbsp; But still, this sort of thing can 
happen. Me personally?&nbsp; I just can&rsquo;t fathom taking the time away 
from my customers and booth during a show to do that to someone else.&nbsp; She 
was even old enough to be my mom!&nbsp; Very surreal experience, but it 
definitely taught me something.</p> 
<p>Those people are out there and being in public puts you in their path. And 
being in business at all means risk &ndash; that&rsquo;s the nature of 
business. Show me a good thing and I&rsquo;ll show you a way someone could be 
victimized by it. And likewise the opposite is true. Everything in life is 
pretty much a two edge sword. It&rsquo;s all in how we live. For now, 
I&rsquo;ll conduct myself ethically, pursue my passion with a pure heart. If at 
any point I need to do something, I will. And judging intent is a tricky 
thing.&nbsp; Makes for interesting discussion though.</p> 
<p>Overall, I see the Pinterest service as kind of a reorganized Google image 
collection. Everything&rsquo;s already out there on Google and coming up in 
searches. I receive a lot of hits from Google image searches and I use image 
searches myself to find specific products I&rsquo;m looking for. Like that 
stitch guide I like but keep misplacing.&nbsp; I never remember the brand name 
for that thing and I&rsquo;m always losing it.&nbsp; I probably have 10 of them 
now.</p> 
<p>Though I&rsquo;m not a huge pinner yet, overall I think Pinterest can be a 
huge benefit to people who&rsquo;d like to be discovered and I hope it stays. 
It&rsquo;s a great tool. A great way to hang onto something visually, link 
included, without taking up space in my bookmarks (a system that doesn&rsquo;t 
really work for me anyway) or mytab groups in Firefox (which works, but is 
mainly suitable for my research, not a lot of other things). It&rsquo;s a great 
way to share new products with others too.&nbsp; Pinterest even helped me get 
the Tardis Kindle cover I wanted, originally pinned by a friend of mine.
Amazon&rsquo;s Universal Wish List never quite did that for me. And that Etsy 
seller would not have gotten my husband&rsquo;s sale without Pinterest.&nbsp; 
Just saying. From a wishlist standpoint, the easy photo-with-link system works.
</p> 
<p>The internet is still a new frontier and as more people get on and learn 
how to make use of it and carve a new world out of it, the more needed tweaks 
and corrections will be discovered.&nbsp; Not much different from settling the 
wild west.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s still the land of opportunity.&nbsp; At the same 
time, folks have to stand up for themselves and their principals.&nbsp; Though 
hopefully we will manage to keep it a relatively free world for generations to 
come.</p>

<h2>Quick Note On The Giveaway, IDs and Custom&nbsp;Commentary</h2> 
<p>So hey guys, I updated the giveaway listing, but just wanted to add (since 
everyone&rsquo;s subscribed and should hence see this) that you should also 
include your Twitter ID&rsquo;s and blog addresses if you have them, so we can 
find you and follow back too!&nbsp; Now, I can only promise that<em> I</em> 
will follow if you do this, but I&rsquo;m requesting also because it would be 
nice for other crocheters to find you when they come to this post too.&nbsp; I 
didn&rsquo;t think to include that at the first publishing, but hey &ndash; 
I&rsquo;m telling you now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a requirement to win the Obey 
Crochet Giveaway, but certainly, if you&rsquo;d like me to follow back and I 
don&rsquo;t already, I&rsquo;d love to!&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m 
the only crocheter who would.</p> 
<p>Besides, I have this whole project on Klout for Tweeps and Peeps in the 
crochet world.&nbsp; As in, I&rsquo;m looking up people who interact with me 
and am making sure they are down for crochet and Stumbling blogs (that would be 
Stumble Upon).&nbsp; I guess I should write a post about that and explain a bit 
more about what I&rsquo;m up to, and what this whole Klout thing is about 
anyway, but the brief of it is I&rsquo;m using my Klout to better represent 
crochet.&nbsp; I mean seriously, when top crochet designers are down as experts 
in hotels, instead of the fiber fests they went to and there&rsquo;s nothing 
about crochet on their Klout profile, yeah, it needs some help.&nbsp; Do I 
think it&rsquo;s a big deal?&nbsp; Hmmm, well, yes and no.&nbsp; Do I think 
there&rsquo;s potential for the artistic/handmade world?&nbsp; Yes, I do.</p> 
<p>But more on that later.&nbsp; In the mean time &ndash; post your blogs and 
twitter ids in your comments, gain some friends!</p> 
<p>Next, I have some custom work I&rsquo;m doing for Lori, a local gal with 
Lakeway Women In Network &ndash; a networking group for women in 
business.&nbsp; Lori wanted a red/black hat like the last one I made, but a 
little shorter and tapered for her face.&nbsp; She also wanted a gold accent 
for the flower motif and so now we&rsquo;re at the point of deciding which 
variation is best.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m putting together a collection of photos 
to make the job easier since we live about an hour from each other.&nbsp; If 
you&rsquo;ve never done custom work before, this can give you an idea of what 
it&rsquo;s like, at least for me.&nbsp; I like to give people choices and get 
them involved with the process as much as feasible.&nbsp; Anything Lori 
doesn&rsquo;t choose will go into my stash of stuff to use with another 
project.&nbsp; When I do shows, it&rsquo;s always nice to have a selection of 
flowers and motifs ready to go so I can customize a hat for someone on the 
spot.&nbsp; So every effort to customize serves future customizations as 
well.&nbsp; A well stocked pantry keeps you fed.&nbsp; So does a well stocked 
stash of supplies and finished parts.</p> 
<p>These flowers are made of the heavier weight yarn like the original.</p> 
<p>Two of the four buttons you see pictured are vintage buttons from my 
Grandmother&rsquo;s stash.&nbsp; The other two are new buttons.&nbsp; Can you 
tell which are which?&nbsp; Also there&rsquo;s a selection of 4 petal flowers 
and 5 petal flowers.&nbsp; Two of the flowers are in a heavier weight yarn than 
the rest.</p> 
<p>These flowers are made of a lighter weight yarn, from a totally different 
company. Pretty close color match, isn't it?</p> 
<p>The bottom right flower is made very similarly to the original flower on 
the original hat in the same yarn. The question now is which flower with which 
button for this new custom hat??</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Which is your favorite?</p>

<h2>Six Business Points That Getting Stuck In The Snow Taught&nbsp;Me</h2> 
<p>Pretty evening view out the hotel window. The streets are iced.</p> 
<p>Yesterday I attempted to get out on the snow-covered streets of Prescott, 
AZ to meet fellow yarnies at a coffee shop. Well, it didn&rsquo;t go so well 
for me. And I learned a few things that can be applied to business as well as 
life.</p> 
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Experts don&rsquo;t always know 
what&rsquo;s right for<em>you</em>.&nbsp;</strong> You are the only one who 
truly knows your background and circumstances.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s<em>your</em>
 job to know your reasonable limits.&nbsp; Locals I talked to were saying, 
&ldquo;Oh, this snow is nothing. You can drive in it. No big deal!&rdquo; 
However, the weather turned out to be not quite what even locals 
expected.&nbsp; In analysis, I think my problem was complicated by drought 
weathered tires and the fact that I have seen snow less times in my life than I 
have fingers. Meaning I have not really driven in real snow either.&nbsp; (We 
generally get ice<em>if</em> we get anything in Austin and everything shuts 
down &ndash; hence I don&rsquo;t get out in it.)&nbsp; My tires seem to have 
good tread, but we had 6 weeks of over 100 degree weather this year in Austin 
and it probably doesn&rsquo;t make it easy on the tires when it comes to 
maneuvering in snow, nor do I have 4-wheel drive.</p> 
<p>After scraping some of the snow off. It was at least 3 inches.</p> 
<p>Though several people seemed OK out there driving, there were people like 
me having trouble.&nbsp; On my way back there was even a van that had once been 
behind me, flipped on its side from trying to make it up a hill.&nbsp; A local 
driver with more experience and better equipment might truly have been fine 
driving out there, but<strong><em>I</em></strong> should have thought better 
and not gone out in the weather.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Things are not always as they seem, but with a little pause and 
think, you can likely figure it out.</strong>&nbsp; Folks crammed into the 
downtown area of Prescott for the parade and other Christmas activities this 
weekend. Lots of families. After all, Prescott is Arizona&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Christmas City.&rdquo;&nbsp; It took quite awhile to get out of the 
hotel parking lot because of all the parade goers.&nbsp; Or so I thought until 
I saw the main road.&nbsp; Perhaps the amount of traffic in the hotel/shopping 
center parking lot should have been a clue that traffic on the main road 
wasn&rsquo;t normal.&nbsp; If I had stopped to figure out that piece of 
information, my decision process would have been much different.</p> 
<p><strong>3. There is no shame in letting others know when you need help.
</strong>&nbsp; Getting unstuck requires space to work.&nbsp; People 
can&rsquo;t help you or give you the space you need on your own without knowing 
something is up in the first place.&nbsp; I had worked my way out on the roads 
and got maybe a mile down the way before I realized that I didn&rsquo;t have a 
lot of visibility and that I was having some trouble with the slick roads after 
all.&nbsp; With a white truck, I knew that other drivers might not realize that 
I could not drive as well as they could in the snow, that my vehicle would not 
be as visible and it definitely did not have a very good turning radius.&nbsp; 
As a result, it was possible that others might not give me the room needed 
should my truck fishtail or should my u-turn not work out as well as I 
hoped.&nbsp; I threw on my hazards and looked for a safe place with enough 
space to safely turn around.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t find any at first.&nbsp; 
Finally I pulled into the snow-filled middle turn lane for a left turn into a 
parking lot that looked big enough to turn around in.&nbsp; Which is where I 
got stuck.</p> 
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; You are not committed to an action if the follow-through 
turns out not to be in your best interest, or not in the best interest of 
others.&nbsp; Do not force what will not likely work, especially when the 
environment of the game has changed.</strong><br>
 In the end, you must 
preserve yourself and others.&nbsp; I had pulled into the center snow filled 
lane thinking it would have more traction and that I could just make a u-turn 
and head right back the way I came.&nbsp; This seems logical under normal 
driving conditions, but here I got stuck.&nbsp; I attempted a few times to 
continue to make that u-turn, but physics proved that it was not going to work 
for me as long as traffic continued the way it was.&nbsp; I was too stuck and 
my truck was starting to drift in a circle.&nbsp; I might have been fine should 
I have been the only person on the road.&nbsp; As it was, though it seemed 
logical, my initial idea was too risky and would put both my life and the lives 
of others in danger.&nbsp; My goal to get home safely had not changed, but I 
needed a new course of action.</p> 
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; <strong>Baby steps are the backbone of any successful 
outcome.&nbsp; Keep the end goal in mind, but focus on the NOW.&nbsp;</strong>
</strong>Getting unstuck from any situation requires focus and patience.&nbsp; 
Drop your main attention from the desired<em>results</em> to the immediate 
steps necessary.&nbsp; My end goal was to get back safely to my hotel. I even 
had a comforting picture in my head of sitting in front of the fire with hot 
tea and relaxing.&nbsp;<em>Oh how I wanted to be there right then!</em>&nbsp; 
However, my main focus needed to be on the first problem, getting unstuck from 
the ice and out of the center lane with traffic coming at me from both 
directions.&nbsp; If any cars around me started to skid, I was a sitting duck.
</p> 
<p>First baby step, get out of that spot.&nbsp; The road finally cleared in 
both directions enough so that I could slip and slide my way back into the lane 
I came from without mishap.&nbsp; I was finally moving, and that baby step was 
solved.&nbsp; However, it put me still going (slowly) in the wrong 
direction.&nbsp; Next baby step, change lanes and find a well-traveled road I 
could turn onto so I can hopefully work my way around a loop to come 
back.&nbsp; Baby Goal: avoid stopping since I seem to get stuck when I 
do.&nbsp; Other baby steps towards getting home safely were also 
required.&nbsp; Stay away from pedestrians (I marveled at the amount of people 
walking around cars that are slip-sliding in the ice) and be still if they come 
near you.&nbsp; Keep a slow steady pace.&nbsp; Start braking half a block away 
from stop lights and flash your brakes so those around you can see you and 
compensate in case you skid.&nbsp; Keep the hazards on.&nbsp; Focus on the 
right now, so you can get to the future.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; Work 
cooperatively with traffic, knowing everyone else is also having to focus on 
their baby steps.&nbsp; Roll down your window, be friendly and let others know 
that your next move depends on them moving first.&nbsp; They might not realize 
the situation, so it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to let them know.&nbsp; And do not 
try to turn into a parking space surrounded by pedestrians and cars when your 
truck obviously won&rsquo;t take the turns under these circumstances.&nbsp; 
While you&rsquo;re at it, pray for everyone.</p> 
<p>Eventually, all these things inevitably led to me to the driveway at my 
hotel, which at an incline had me stuck again for a bit, and then on into a 
parking space way in the back of the lot.&nbsp; I may have had to walk a ways, 
but I didn&rsquo;t mind, because it allowed me to park safely.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
<em>been</em> in a horrible car wreck that I was lucky to walk away from.&nbsp; 
And I spent over a year in physical therapy regaining strength in my left arm 
and hand as a result + years of pain.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve worked hard, overcome a 
lot and never want to repeat that experience, for me or for anyone else.&nbsp; 
I feel blessed.</p> 
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Fear (not panic) is a motivator that can 
keep you alert and clear the mind.&nbsp; However, STRESS requires a lot of 
energy and recovery time.</strong>&nbsp; Allow for the reboot when 
there&rsquo;s stress.&nbsp; After I got back, I realized my goal and relaxed by 
that fire with some crochet and tea for a bit.&nbsp; However, after a short 
while, I had to head upstairs before completely passing out from the intensity 
of the day.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t lay down for long, since we needed to meet 
friends for dinner and would be walking, but the bit did wonders for helping me 
finish out my day.</p> 
<p>Not bad for a life lesson, huh?&nbsp; Goes to show, lessons can be drawn 
from even the mundane, and<em>all</em> experiences have value.&nbsp; 
Y&rsquo;all stay safe out there and Happy December!</p>

<h2>Kumihimo Could Be The Ultimate Stash&nbsp;Buster</h2> 
<p>Today was well spent at A Good Yarn taking a beginning Kumihimo class from 
Jeannie.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a good teacher!&nbsp; And the class proved to me 
what I suspected&hellip;&nbsp;<em> Kumihimo</em> might just be the ultimate 
stash buster.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Kumihimo</em></strong> is the Japanese term and method for 
braiding.&nbsp; There are many different types, but we learned a basic<em>yatsu 
umi</em>, or 8-strand round braid.&nbsp; Jeannie even introduced us to using 
beads.&nbsp; For a basic<em>yatsu umi</em> starter project, we each started 
with four strands of about two yards each, doubled over to make eight strands 
to work with, and create a key chain.&nbsp; Most everyone else stopped with a 
normal sized key chain, but since I was camping out for part of the day anyway, 
I kept going until I had no more threads left to work with!&nbsp; So 
mine&rsquo;s actually long enough for a necklace now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking 
about taking the split ring off and instead adding a decorative clasp for an 
offset design.&nbsp; Maybe add a crochet element.&nbsp; Not sure yet how, but 
pretty sure this is going to be a necklace.</p> 
<p>The fun thing about Kumihimo (and I should have taken some photos of 
Jeannie&rsquo;s examples to do her justice), is that you can use up scraps of 
yarn and thread that might not be long enough to do much else with.&nbsp; She 
had examples of several made from a variety of yarns, thick and thin, including 
pigtail-eyelash.&nbsp; How much stash you can bust with braiding depends on 
your end project idea, of course, but it adds one more thing to my bucket of 
tools and growing skills.&nbsp; I look atkumihimo and see possibilities for 
jewelry, where crochet might not give me the result I want, but also, I think 
this could make a much stronger, less stretchy purse strapfor some of my 
weighty beaded purses, over crochet.&nbsp; One of my fellow classmates 
mentioned wanting to make some for decorating Christmas presents.</p> 
<p>Here are some photos of my <em>yatsu umi</em>.</p> 
<p>This is the basic beginner's small Kumihimo kit, long with my yatsu umi 
hanging out the backside.</p> 
<p>The yatsu umi has a spiral effect when you use contrasting colors.</p> 
<p>Beading adds a nice element to the spiral braid.</p> 
<p>My yatsu umi is long enough to make a necklace! I'm thinking I might take 
off the split ring and instead turn this into an offset necklace with a 
decorative clasp.</p> 
<p>If you find yourself in Prescott, AZ, I can&rsquo;t recommend the local 
yarn shoppe &ndash;A Good Yarn &ndash; enough. They are incredibly helpful, 
friendly and a bright spot to visit. I also LOVE Debra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Buck A 
Ball&rdquo; community donation project. Drop off your unused yarn leftovers, or 
balls you aren&rsquo;t going to use, and Debra puts them in a box for $1 a 
ball, with all proceeds going to the local women&rsquo;s shelter. Umm, yes I 
found some goodies to buy in the box too. Gracious and community oriented, this 
store is one of the most crochet friendly yarn stores I&rsquo;ve ever shopped. 
And you can tell that Prescott locals value them too, as they stayed busy with 
many local friends coming and going, friendly chatter, along with newbies who 
dropped by today as well. I met a lady from South Africa today who said 
she&rsquo;d heard so much about this store she just had to come. Seriously, you 
can&rsquo;t help but be in great hands!</p> 
<p>Carma, Jeannie and Debra! When you are in Prescott, you must visit these 
super friendly ladies and tell them I sent you!</p>

<h2>Field Testing The Crochet Gear in&nbsp;Prescott</h2> 
<p>All that frosty grey on my hat and giant scarf is snow!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Happy December everyone!</p> 
<p>I am in Prescott, AZ, field testing my Crochet Gear! LOL!&nbsp; OK, 
that&rsquo;s not really the purpose of our visit, but I have enjoyed the 
opportunity to none-the-less.</p> 
<p>We just got in tonight and it started to snow!&nbsp; Super pretty!&nbsp; 
Dear hubby and I enjoyed a walk in the snow around the square after dinner 
tonight.&nbsp; (For those who might not know, we&rsquo;ve only seen snow in 
Austin maybe 4 times in the last 17 years and where I grew up, I only saw it 
about 3 times as a kid, so any snow is a pretty treat for me!)</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite our anniversary, but it&rsquo;s close and we&rsquo;ll 
be celebrating 16 years.&nbsp; The grand &lsquo;rents are staying with the kids 
back home, holding down the fort and giving us this time together.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s a blessing I sure won&rsquo;t turn down!&nbsp; And the &lsquo;rents 
and kiddos are getting quality time too.</p> 
<p>Got a plan in the works while I&rsquo;m here this year.&nbsp; While 
hubby&rsquo;s taking care of work tomorrow, I&rsquo;m scheduled to take a 
Kumihimo class at the local yarn store A Good Yarn.&nbsp; You might rememberI 
blogged about them last year.&nbsp; I drop by and see them every time we 
come.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve moved recently and I look forward to seeing their new 
digs and visiting with folks I&rsquo;ve met in years past.</p> 
<p>Saturday afternoon I&rsquo;m catching up with yarnies at Method 
Coffee.&nbsp; And sometime before we leave, I&rsquo;ll be seeing about dropping 
byPeaceful Prairie Alpaca Ranch to see Wendy.</p> 
<p>We ate at Prescott Brewing Company tonight.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a favorite of 
ours, along with their Christmas ale.&nbsp; Seriously, all their food seems to 
be top notch, as are the brews.&nbsp; I try something different each time and 
am always pleased.&nbsp; On our walk earlier, I noticed a shop with Tibet 
imports I want to check out.&nbsp; Also have to be sure and go by theArts 
Prescott Gallery Coop.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where I found my gorgeous blue 
dichroic glass necklace that everyone loves.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great shop of 
several local artists&rsquo; work.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll stop by Bead-It on 
Whiskey Row.&nbsp; And there are a couple homemade type candy shops too.&nbsp; 
Plus we should be able to catch the city&rsquo;s lighting of the courthouse on 
Saturday.&nbsp; It should be fun!</p> 
<p>All in all, I look forward to a pleasant visit and lots of photos and 
reporting. Provided we aren&rsquo;t snowed in!</p>

<h2>Your Smarts Can Make You&nbsp;Weak</h2> 
<p>This touches an arena that I feel rather passionately about.&nbsp; The 
attitude of expertise that says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the head authority on this and 
do not need to learn anything else.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No one like you could 
possibly teach me something about the world I&rsquo;m already an expert 
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; This attitude in life does not operate from a place of 
strength. It makes you weak.</p> 
<p>This is especially dumb in leadership roles.&nbsp; And it pretty much 
rejects assistance altogether. If you&rsquo;re an expert in parenting, why read 
books on the subject? If you&rsquo;re an expert in marriage, why ever consider 
counseling or a &ldquo;marriage building&rdquo; event? If you&rsquo;re an 
expert in education, why explore new ways to reach a struggling student or 
improve the educational experience for everyone? If you&rsquo;re an expert in 
business, why consult a coach? Why do anything to push your current boundaries? 
Yada.&nbsp; Feel like you never get any help?&nbsp; Umm, maybe check yourself 
here.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it in religious as well as philosophical circles. 
It&rsquo;s present in the educational system. Even witnessed it to my surprise 
in the field of mathematics. And it&rsquo;s so prevalent in politics (what I 
call the new religion) today. The idea in general that my way is the right way. 
Or my way is the only way. There is nothing else outside of that. It&rsquo;s 
like being in a cage and it can become a difficult barrier to break through.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t just plague leadership roles. Ever know someone who is 
an expert in everything, even in fields they&rsquo;ve never touched? I&rsquo;m 
reminded of a conversation with someone once about selling the home 
they&rsquo;d lived in for 25+ years. The owner voiced many concerns over the 
idea and work she wasn&rsquo;t sure might need to be done or even the paperwork 
involved. &ldquo;Have you talked to a real estate agent? They could really help 
you know what you need to do and talk to you about the market right now,&rdquo; 
I said. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I already know everything I need to 
know about my house and this neighborhood. There&rsquo;s nothing worthwhile an 
agent could ever tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously?</p> 
<p>In my mind, this type of mentality is the very source of division and 
stagnation. There is wisdom and growth at the center of many approaches and 
views. Thank goodness for the experts in my life who can give me other 
viewpoints and ways of seeing things. I am not eternal enough to contain all 
the truth and insight of the universe.</p> 
<p>I have expertise, experience and a perspective that is very useful in many 
ways. But it ain&rsquo;t everything.&nbsp; No one&rsquo;s is.</p>

<h2>Sometimes Even Nellie Oleson Is&nbsp;Right</h2> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> </dl> 
<p>I&rsquo;m known to coin phrases.&nbsp; One of my favorites? 
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always aNellie Oleson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyone who grew up 
reading or watchingLittle House on the Prairie barks a knowing laugh.&nbsp; And 
anyone else just stares blankly at me!&nbsp; Both reactions are fun.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; And the statement rings so true.</p> 
<p>Fact is, there is always <em>that</em> person somewhere in your life.&nbsp; 
That one person who gets under your skin, who acts as a challenge to you.&nbsp; 
Whether as a minor yet annoying inconvenience, or as someone whose very 
existence seems to defy yours.&nbsp; Perhaps that one person you can&rsquo;t 
help but think privately about, &ldquo;Everything would be a lot nicer if they 
just would just go away.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Nellie Oleson exists for you, in some form, in your life somewhere.&nbsp; 
And every time you think she&rsquo;s gone, resolved and moved on, another one 
pops up in her place.&nbsp; Her character is able to be so easily understood 
because there is always someone who plays this part in each of our lives.&nbsp; 
After all, Life is always about the overcoming.&nbsp; Of some<em> thing</em>
&hellip; even some<em>one</em>.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to habitually ignore whatever she has to say.&nbsp; <em>
That nasty &lsquo;ol Nellie Oleson!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s always such a pain!</em>
&nbsp; But the fact is,<em>sometimes</em>, as conniving as she can be, as cruel 
and awful as she can sound &ndash; sometimes your Nellie is<em>right</em>.</p> 
<p>Nellie has no vested interest in you.&nbsp; Hurt as it may, and as 
frustrating as it can be to think she&rsquo;s won and maybe gotten to you, 
Nellie has a way of pointing out the truth of the matter, in all it&rsquo;s 
rawness.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter that she&rsquo;s your wrongful 
tormentor, nor for how many times.&nbsp; When she&rsquo;s right, she&rsquo;s 
right.&nbsp; Telling you what your friends didn&rsquo;t want to say.&nbsp; 
Sporting her evil little smirk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing out what you didn&rsquo;t 
want to see.&nbsp; That<em> this</em> time, and boy do you know it, <em>
you&rsquo;re</em> the <em>one</em> who is <em>wrong</em>.&nbsp; Pointing out 
that flaw you want to forget, making known your weaknesses, revealing who you 
really are.</p> 
<p>You don&rsquo;t just hate her.&nbsp; You hate how she makes you feel.&nbsp; 
Because deep down it sucks to see yourself without the ignorant bliss or the 
rose-colored glasses your friends and loved ones are all too happy to loan 
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not always rosy.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not always 
nice.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not always right.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t always make 
great decisions.&nbsp; Sometimes, those pants<em>do</em> make you look fat and 
sometimes you&rsquo;re dead wrong.&nbsp; Sometimes even an emperor needs a loud 
mouth kid to tell him he&rsquo;s a fool without any clothes on. &nbsp; 
Someone&rsquo;s gotta do the job.&nbsp; If your friends won&rsquo;t, the Nellie 
in your life will.&nbsp; The fact is, Nellie has an unabashed way of testing 
you and holding up the mirror so you can really see yourself.&nbsp; Think 
you&rsquo;re a good person?&nbsp; Think you&rsquo;re really something?&nbsp; 
Think you&rsquo;re better than Nellie?&nbsp; Are ya really?&nbsp; Even 
now?&nbsp; Even under pressure?</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> </dl> 
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a lesson in all that, a role she needs to play, a 
purpose to fulfill.&nbsp; After all, how can we change and overcome what we 
cannot see?&nbsp; She may not be soft and cuddly, but Nelly won&rsquo;t try to 
protect us from ourselves.</p> 
<p>Perhaps even you&rsquo;ve been a Nellie yourself.&nbsp; And maybe 
she&rsquo;s not as bad as you think.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Fun fact: Alison Arngrim, the actress behind the TV personality of&nbsp; 
Nellie Oleson released a 5 star book last year called: &ldquo;Confessions Of A 
Prairie Bitch: How I Survived Nellie Oleson And Learned To Love To Be Hated
.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Mommy Can&rsquo;t Right Now, She&rsquo;s&nbsp;Texting</h2> 
<p>I was struck by a scene in my neighborhood earlier today.&nbsp; There was a 
toddler sitting in a wagon by the side of the road, wiggling his butt, 
obviously wanting the wagon to go.&nbsp; And his mom (or babysitter?) was 
leaning on a telephone pole nearby, with her phone in her hand.&nbsp; Texting, 
surfing, I don&rsquo;t know, but she was not talking. And she had completely 
checked out.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s always seemed odd to me when parents disconnect from their 
children for long hours talking on the phone.&nbsp; We do all need 
breaks.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp; Before 
texting became a reality, there were plenty of people who could not disconnect 
from their cell phones.&nbsp; And before cell phones, they could not disconnect 
from their home phones.&nbsp; And there was a time before that when it might 
have been the back yard fence I guess.&nbsp; Now they can do it more openly and 
quietly by text.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure what I think of it.&nbsp; On the one hand, I 
value good tools.&nbsp; And my phone, along with its texting capabilities, is a 
good tool.&nbsp; That said, I know when I had computer work to do at home when 
the kids were little, it was hard for them to understand why I couldn&rsquo;t 
play sometimes.&nbsp; After all, to their little eyes, I was just sitting there 
staring at a brightly lit box.&nbsp; Sure, I showed them things and introduced 
them to a computer at an early age to help both of them with development, learn 
how to edit school projects, etc..&nbsp; And later school came to require 
it.&nbsp; But still, until they understood and valued the use of a computer at 
all, they did not get it.&nbsp; At least a TV made noise and pictures.&nbsp; 
They could understand someone staring at it.&nbsp; They stared at TV too.&nbsp; 
But often a computer is a bunch of words, while mommy seemed to stare off into 
space. I had to work from home to make it work out to be at home with my 
kids.&nbsp; I would set them next to me with things to do while I worked, and I 
planned lots of activities together, but I couldn&rsquo;t always just stop when 
they wanted.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a Zen belief about being fully present in whatever you set 
your hand to do.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help but ponder these things when I see 
people staring at their phones while a child goes unnoticed nearby.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m not sure what I expect, especially as someone who values her tools, 
and as someone who probably doesn&rsquo;t really know what was going on.&nbsp; 
But certainly I expected something different.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a different kind of world our kids are growing up in.&nbsp; I 
know my grandparents saw that when I was a kid.&nbsp; I see it for my own 
kids.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s always a trickle-down.&nbsp; Generations of latch-key 
kids led to generations of fairly self-sufficient adults.&nbsp; I wonder what 
the trickle down is here?</p>

<h2>Up And Coming&nbsp;Projects&hellip;</h2> 
<p>NaBloPoMo is getting close to an end!&nbsp;&nbsp; And so far I&rsquo;ve 
managed to stay on track!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a good exercise for me to 
pursue different writing ideas and a kick in the rear to get it done!&nbsp; As 
I look ahead to what&rsquo;s left of the year, Christmas is not far away now 
and I have a trip, custom orders, more shows and school fundraiser stuff to 
keep up with.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; Not to mention a project my brother and I might 
collaborate on.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re still hashing out the details to see if we 
think it&rsquo;s viable or not.&nbsp; Oh! And thanks to Facebook, three 
childhood girlfriends and I are planning a slumber party during winter 
break!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so excited!&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be our first Christmas 
occasion together!&nbsp; &nbsp; I have to thank Facebook for making it possible 
to bring people I love back into my life.</p> 
<p>Today is run around crazy and do all the laundry day so there&rsquo;s 
plenty of clothes for everyone.&nbsp; And I need to clean out the car and get 
some of my show stuff from last week put into storage.&nbsp; Plus I 
couldn&rsquo;t sleep much last night, so I worked on these two hat beauties for 
a custom order.&nbsp; Though similar, each hat is made with different yarns, 
different hooks and different stitches to achieve the same essential 
look.&nbsp; Except for the squiggles.&nbsp; They are identical.&nbsp; This will 
give my customer a choice as far as color saturation.&nbsp; My daughter was 
kind enough to model them for me.&nbsp; Even letting her true nature out during 
one shot!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m playing around with lighting, with flash and without 
flash, trying to get the purples to really come out.&nbsp; So there are a few 
photos here, but only two hats.&nbsp; Can you tell the difference?&nbsp; We 
call these Squiggle Hats, named by my daughter when she was little.&nbsp; They 
are an Aberrant Crochet exclusive design.</p> 
<p>All my cameos sold at the last couple shows.&nbsp; I hunted for more like 
them, but couldn&rsquo;t find the exact colors in those sizes.&nbsp; And my 
original supplier is no longer supplying.&nbsp; I did however find similar and 
a mauve design I like pretty well.&nbsp; (OK, I&rsquo;m picky.)&nbsp; I also 
found two new lacy frames I really like that are reproductions of antique 
frames.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t wait to work some crochet lace into 
them!&nbsp;&nbsp; Still waiting on the right sized cameos for the smaller frame 
though.&nbsp; Plus, I came across an estate collection of Gothic skull cameo 
pieces from an old jewelry store that I scarfed up too.&nbsp; They will be 
quite fun to work with and I know my daughter&rsquo;s friends will be 
interested at the school bazaar coming up.&nbsp; Since the bazaar too often has 
little of interest to teens, and more of interest to the younger kids, 
I&rsquo;m happy to oblige hunting down some steam punk/goth rock/pirate stuff 
for them. Never was into teddy bears, me.</p> 
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m forgetting something though.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s 
one of those big fears I always have.&nbsp; I hate forgetting things.&nbsp; So 
I&rsquo;m wracking my brain today, making my &ldquo;Remember The Milk&rdquo; 
lists and trying to meditate on details in a logical order to see what might be 
missing.&nbsp; If you haven&rsquo;t heard of it,Remember The Milk is a handy 
app that allows you to create multiple lists.&nbsp; There is a free version, 
which you can just use on your computer and a pro version that allows you to 
sinc it with your smart phone multiple times a day.&nbsp; I have not fully 
explored the whole platform, but so far I&rsquo;m finding it very handy.&nbsp; 
I keep a perpetual grocery list this way too.&nbsp; As soon as I remember 
something, I type it into my list.&nbsp; When it&rsquo;s time to go to the 
store, I sinc everything to my phone and voila! I have my list everywhere I 
go!&nbsp; Which is good, because I lose paper lists.&nbsp; Chronically.</p> 
<p>Anyway, hopefully I&rsquo;ll remember that thing that&rsquo;s bugging 
me.&nbsp; In the mean time, check out the pics!</p>

<h2>Regulating Your Sleep&nbsp;Cycle</h2> 
<p>As someone who damaged their immune system in her early 20&prime;s from 
sacrificing sleep, please take it from me and make this a priority if you have 
issues with your sleep cycle. Our immune system will successfully deal with 
many things until we sacrifice sleep, diet and sunlight. My sleep issues got 
worse after having kids and nursing and it took awhile to get my sleep cycles 
corrected.</p> 
<p>I am not a doctor, and any decision you make is yours and yours alone. You 
should always consider seeing a doctor or another certified health 
professional. But these are natural ways that have helped me. (I&rsquo;m 
allergic to many medications, so these are avenues my doctors have helped me 
find to do.)&nbsp; I put this out there in case it might help others find a 
direction in solving this problem.</p> 
<p>1. Melatonin. It&rsquo;s an over the counter &ldquo;vitamin&rdquo; 
(synthetic hormone actually). Melatonin does not make you sleep per se, it will 
improve the quality of your sleep, help you get to that deeper REM and help 
regulate your internal clock again. If you have not dreamed in a while (as is 
the case for many exhausted people), the first few nights you will likely have 
a rush of wild dreams as your psyche downloads.&nbsp; Some people may not 
experience this. A lot of people do.&nbsp; Make sure you have plenty of time to 
sleep when you first start taking melatonin so there&rsquo;s proper time to be 
at that deep level of sleep. Two hours will not work.</p> 
<p>Melatonin is created from serotonin, so if you don&rsquo;t have enough of 
one, you likely don&rsquo;t have enough of the other. L-Tryptophan (an amino 
acid found in food like turkey) can also be found over the counter and is what 
the body uses to make serotonin, which is then converted to melatonin at night. 
If at any point you start waking up again in the middle of the night while 
taking melatonin, take a smaller dose or don&rsquo;t take it. It does seem to 
build up in the system. Melatonin is processed through the liver, so keeping 
your liver healthy is also a good idea. Avoid alcohol for awhile, consider 
milk-thistle to support liver health. Also, low levels of serotonin are 
associated with increased carbohydrate cravings, depression, heightened 
sensitivity to pain, and troubled sleep patterns.</p> 
<p>The smaller dosages (mcg) of melatonin did not work for me. But 5mg did. 
Don&rsquo;t take it unless you are going to get at least 6 hours of sleep. And 
take it an hour before you want to go to bed. Today, I don&rsquo;t need as much 
or as often (in fact I rarely take it) and I&rsquo;m much less chronically 
exhausted.&nbsp; But it was a life saver when my son started sleeping through 
the night and I still couldn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>I recommend you search some medical sites about melatonin to give you more 
information as well.</p> 
<p>2. Light destroys melatonin in the body, especially the blue spectrum 
(though serotonin levels do increase during light exposure &ndash; sunlight 
being best). An hour before bed start turning off and dimming your lights. 
Also, no computer use during this time is also best, as the whole light issue 
is specific to your eyes. Staring at a computer screen is staring right into a 
source of light. The last lights you leave on should be yellow tone or even 
candle-light, avoid blue tone like the daylight bulbs you find. Do not leave a 
candle burning while you sleep. If you must use night lights, use red bulbs. 
Completely darken your room.</p> 
<p>3. Go camping (tent, not cabin). Seriously, when you do not artificially 
extend your day with lights and the conveniences of modern life, your body will 
naturally try to sync up with the sun and other creatures around you. 
You&rsquo;ll likely wake with dawn too. A night or two of camping have helped 
reset my internal clock.</p> 
<p>4. Try not to eat a meal within 4 hours of going to bed. That being said, 
some people benefit from a simple glass of milk before bed. No sugar, caffeine 
or apples too close to bed. Apples contain a substance better than coffee for 
keeping you alert.&nbsp; Whenever I have to drive for a trip, I take a bag of 
apples to eat while I drive. Works like a charm. Don&rsquo;t eat them before 
bed.</p> 
<p>5. Probiotics. Some people have trouble sleeping because something&rsquo;s 
going on in their digestive track. Probiotics will help iron that out. And 
oddly, they do have a relationship to correcting in the gut whatever is 
decreasing proper serotonin/melatonin production.</p> 
<p>Good luck, talk to a doctor and hope you get some sleep!</p>

<h2>Four Dysfunctional Attitudes About&nbsp;Communication</h2> 
<p>Effective communication is the key to everything. To business, to 
relationships, to peace.&nbsp; However people often have some dysfunctional 
ways of thinking about the subject. Let&rsquo;s take a look at these and see if 
any apply.</p> 
<p><strong>1. There is no such thing as just one solution!&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Encourage people to always get at least a 2nd (qualified) opinion, whatever 
the situation is, especially when there are doubts.&nbsp; There are more 
equally effective ways up the same mountain than just one.&nbsp; Seriously, if 
you reach the summit and find that someone else climbed up a different way, 
would you shove them off the mountain top for not doing it the 
&ldquo;right&rdquo; way?&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d probably share 
a celebratory drink and take in the view together.&nbsp; Wisdom is found in the 
midst of a multitude of views.&nbsp; Holding that kind of outlook has served me 
far better than most.&nbsp; It applies to anything in life, health or business.
</p> 
<p><strong>2. It&rsquo;s OK for someone else to be the expert.</strong></p> 
<p>No human is infinite enough to contain all the knowledge of a single 
subject, much less of the universe. We should celebrate that wonder and make 
use of individual expertise by adding the insight and value of others to our 
lives and teams.&nbsp; Just because I<em>can</em> doesn&rsquo;t mean I should 
or that it&rsquo;s in my (or anyone else&rsquo;s) best interest.&nbsp; Not 
being an expert in something is not a negative reflection on us.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m thankful for the experts in my life.&nbsp; I can not possibly hold 
that much information in this one physical and<em>finite</em> body.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m an expert in crochet.&nbsp; I can be that.&nbsp; Thank God someone 
else can be an expert in car repair and plumbing for me!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m no 
less a person for it.</p> 
<p>For an expansion on this idea, check out Derek Sivers&rsquo; video &ldquo;
Hell Yeah Or No.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Confrontation is not a dirty word.</strong></p> 
<p>Communication is essential to mediation. As someone who tends to 
communicate fairly well, others often come to me with their frustrations in 
dealing with someone else.&nbsp; Many times they hope I will intercede for 
them.&nbsp; I listen, but often followup with, &ldquo;OK, you&rsquo;ve hashed 
out your concerns with me, but have you gone to the source? Have you talked to 
that teacher/volunteer/manager/parent/business/peer that you have a 
suggestion/concern/issue with? Because they can&rsquo;t do anything about what 
they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; All too often, people avoid confrontation, so 
nothing is ever addressed. When you feel helpless, the last thing you should do 
is give up.&nbsp; Avoiding the person or issue will not often resolve anything.
</p> 
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Emotional Reality and Factual Reality Are Not The Same.
</strong></p> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re having trouble seeing things straight, it is also 
important to keep in mind that although emotional reality<em> is real</em> and 
it<em>does</em> give us valuable information, that emotional reality and 
factual reality are not generally the same.&nbsp; Making decisions based solely 
on feelings is not a balanced place to operate from.&nbsp; Many emotions are 
caused by triggers.&nbsp; And triggers can be very individual and 
personal.&nbsp; What triggers you and what triggers me is not necessarily going 
to be similar.&nbsp; Your feelings might be real, but they may have nothing to 
do with the actual situation at hand.&nbsp; As hard as it may be, sometimes you 
have to step outside of that emotional reality with logical mindful intent.</p> 
<p>What other dysfunctional attitudes about communication can you think of?<br>
 Think about it and share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<h2>Apparently It Is Easy To Make Butter When A Ninja Is Involved &ndash; A 
Thanksgiving&nbsp;Mishap</h2> 
<p>Lightly sweetened butter, that was supposed to be whipped cream. I poured 
off the liquid already.</p> 
<p>Everyone knows that whipped cream is a requirement for pumpkin pie on 
Thanksgiving.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s pumpkin pie season!&nbsp; My favorite.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have 
ready made whipped cream, so I whipped out the carton of heavy whipping cream I 
keep on reserve for chocolate ganache and whipped up a batch. LOL. See how 
punny I am?</p> 
<p>I love this time of year.&nbsp; Pulling out old family recipes, taking time 
not to be stressed about the world and just be thankful in this sacred 
space.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a special day of magic really.&nbsp; The kind that only 
love and gratitude can create.&nbsp; I like this day.</p> 
<p><em>ANYway&hellip;</em> When the need arises, I usually whip up little 
batches of whipped cream with one of my small food processors. (Only the real 
stuff for me.)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great way to cheat at all sorts of things, 
like whipped cream and cream gravy. I have cooked from scratch all my life, but 
I have never really been able to master a rue. How do I get around that?&nbsp; 
Blend some flour, spices and milk in a blender and you&rsquo;ve got instant 
cream gravy or stew thickener. Corn starch too. I love me my food processors!
</p> 
<p>Truth be told, I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of them. I love frozen fruit 
smoothies too. Been making them since I got out of college and could buy my 
first machine. However, I like the all fruit kind and I don&rsquo;t water them 
down with ice. Which is actually harder on the machines. Ice shatters 
easily.&nbsp; Frozen fruit does not.&nbsp; Those drink wands? I burnt out three 
of them. Along with several small food choppers and blenders. Then there was 
the small Cuisinart I brutalized until it finally had plastic bits cracking off 
it from the sheer vibrational impact of frozen fruit blending in a machine that 
was never designed for what I was putting it through. But my frozen goodie 
product was yum!</p> 
<p>Later I finally got a Magic Bullet. OMG! I loved it! Still have it too. (If 
you don&rsquo;t want yours, I&rsquo;ll take it!)&nbsp; However, you can only 
make a small bit at a time.&nbsp; And my kids love smoothies too.</p> 
<p>So then came the opportunity to own a Ninja. Sam&rsquo;s Club had one left 
on clearance for half price. It&rsquo;s one of the smaller models, but I took 
one look and grabbed it. Hell yeah. Strawberry/Spinach smoothie tonight!</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a little finicky, but my Ninja works well. The larger model 
might be less finicky.&nbsp; Mine&rsquo;s really designed to make the smoothies 
that you water down with ice. And if you do, you will have no trouble with it. 
However, as you already know, I don&rsquo;t like adding ice. Probably 
doesn&rsquo;t help that I don&rsquo;t have an ice maker. But I did figure out 
that if I toss in the strawberries and other frozen fruit in alone, before 
adding spinach or anything else, it will powder them nicely and<em>then</em> I 
can easily add my yogurt and greens. But not until then. (It helps to use<em>
sliced</em> frozen strawberries too, btw.) Once you have that figured out, it 
works like a dream blending up a whole pitcher of smoothie at a time. </p> 
<p>So back to whipped cream. A small food processor will help you whip up the 
good stuff in no time without pulling out your blender and all the clean up. 
(I&rsquo;m all for practical and the least amount of work.)&nbsp; Add your 
cream, a tad bit of honey for sweetener and blend until it looks right. Voila. 
Whipped cream.</p> 
<p>Along come Ninja. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve used it for whipped 
cream. In about 20-30 seconds I had whipped cream. Upon tasting, though, hubby 
didn&rsquo;t feel it was sweet enough. So I added more honey and blended away. 
About another thirty seconds later, I had chunks in my cream and by another 30, 
it was butter. It wasn&rsquo;t until I opened it up that I realized what was 
going on.</p> 
<p>Stupid Ninja, I wanted whipped cream for my pie and now I don&rsquo;t have 
any at all.&nbsp; So now I have instead a delicate sweetened cream butter 
I&rsquo;ll have to decide how I want to use. Grandma Leona would have been 
jealous.</p>

<h2>Three Communication Tips To Help You Get Your Point&nbsp;Across</h2> 
<p>If I&rsquo;m not careful, I can be a talker. As a natural at the art of 
capturing a story, it&rsquo;s a gift. But it can also be a weakness. Here are 
three tools I&rsquo;ve found useful to help me stay trim in my communications 
and remain effective in the long run.&nbsp; This includes marketing and sales.
</p> 
<p>1. Remember that people communicate (and retain) information best in three 
main ways: audio, visual and kinetic. A balance of the three seems to work 
best. Honestly, sometimes we need to shut up and let a picture say a 1000 words 
or let someone get a literal handle on something. But beyond that, the truth is 
that some people retain and communicate best by hearing their own thoughts 
expressed in audio. Which means, get them into the discussion and you&rsquo;ll 
get the best out of them.</p> 
<p>My son is an example of someone who performs best through discussion, not 
just listening. He has an unusual visual impairment with a kind of blend of 
parallax and monocular vision (and medical terms I find difficult to 
describe).&nbsp; Due to this, his thoughts literally form best through 
discussion and the hearing of his own voice. Once he&rsquo;s been a part of the 
discussion, he&rsquo;s your man and knows exactly what to do. Without it, he 
has a harder time putting his thought process in order or &ldquo;getting 
it&rdquo; because he has no mental black-board to &ldquo;see&rdquo; things in 
his mind. When he can verbalize thoughts as they take form, the quality of his 
work is amazingly better, because his brain is wired that way. It&rsquo;s been 
an interesting path of discovery for us at home and I&rsquo;ve learned to 
tailor my communication for others as a result.</p> 
<p>2. There is a book that I love called: <em><strong>How to Get Your Point 
Across in 30 Seconds or Less,</strong></em> by Milo Frank. I listen to the 
audio version on a periodic basis to remind me how to trim my words and get to 
the point.</p> 
<p>3. Once words are spoken, you can&rsquo;t take them back. So if it&rsquo;s 
the wrong words, or just too many, the problem is the same. I like to keep in 
mind an old adage that goes something like this: &ldquo;Better they wonder why 
you didn&rsquo;t open your mouth, than why you did!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>These are some thoughts that have helped me in both my professional and 
personal communications, as well as marketing.&nbsp; I hope they help you too.

<h2>Look What I Found! Vintage&nbsp;Finds!</h2> 
<p>I lucked into some vintage finds at a thrift store today. I&rsquo;m pretty 
pleased with them! How much did I pay? Now that&rsquo;s my little secret!</p> 
<p>Vintage finds from today!</p> 
<p>I love the bee earrings! They will definitely become hat pins. The fake 
pearls are hand-knotted and over all look great, though two of the beads are 
flaking. Also found a sweet little silver chain.</p> 
<p>A cute little locket in the shape of an envelope.</p> 
<p>Came with a stamp inside!</p> 
<p>Recognition of this guy can definitely date you! It's Ronald McDonald's 
friend Hamburglar! Playing hockey! This mug is from the McDonald's Sports 
Series from 1977. This is going to be my new coffee mug!</p> 
<p>This pretty dish needs washing, but will look beautiful full of peppermints 
and ribbon candy! My Grandma Dot used to keep a dish of ribbon candy every year 
during the holidays. I haven't had ribbon candy in years!</p> 
<p>This awesome Steven Harris tie totally got my funny bone! I love the 
outdated computer equipment pictured all over it! I'm not sure what I want to 
do with this just yet, but I definitely wanted to give it a home! There were 
some beautiful silk Hawaiian ties there as well, but I decided not to get them 
too.</p>

<h2>How Much Are You&nbsp;Worth?</h2> 
<p>What is the true cost of handmade items at a show?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not 
really talking about taking a bead and sticking it on an ear wire. 
There&rsquo;s almost no training or skill involved in that.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s 
not much honing of a craft going on there.&nbsp; Though it does take time to 
assemble, it&rsquo;s small and not considered skilled labor.</p> 
<p>How much do you make an hour for your expertise?&nbsp; How much <em>should
</em> a hand crafter make per hour?&nbsp; What is right for a living 
wage?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy to forget sometimes the nature of how some jobs 
work.&nbsp; In many jobs, you get paid a set wage + benefits.&nbsp; Some jobs 
involve a commission, which is generally highly taxed by the government even if 
it is really what you feed yourself with.&nbsp; Other jobs, like waiting 
tables, are often half of minimum wage with the expectation that you will make 
up the rest in tips.&nbsp; That was a rude awakening when I landed my first 
waiting job right out of college.&nbsp; I was taxed out of my $2.13 an hour 
each week as if it were twice that, because it&rsquo;s assumed I would make up 
the other half of minimum wage on tips.&nbsp; And I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Sigh, 
those were the days.<em></em></p> 
<p>So how much should a hand crafter make?&nbsp; Well, one obvious thing to 
consider is the cost of table fees to get into the show in the first 
place.&nbsp; Just here in Austin, there are shows that range from $40 a table 
to over $3000.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a chunk of change, and somewhat of a gamble 
playing the odds whether you will sell something at the venue or not.&nbsp; 
Space rental is not cheap.&nbsp; Neither is security, electricity or many other 
expenses people might not think of.&nbsp; If you take credit cards, you have 
expenses there as well.</p> 
<p>You have the cost of materials as overhead.&nbsp; When it comes to yarn, 
it&rsquo;s interesting to me that so many buyers really have no idea how much 
yarn can cost these days.&nbsp; To buy enough to create a garment is a pretty 
substantial chunk.&nbsp; Are we using &ldquo;That Old 70&prime;s 
Yarn?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or something nicer like silk or cashmere or even a 
microfiber?&nbsp; Either way, it&rsquo;s way more now than it was when I was a 
kid.</p> 
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the amount of materials as well.&nbsp; Just because a 
hat you find at WalMart cost $5 doesn&rsquo;t mean it has a comparable amount 
of fiber in it to something handmade.&nbsp; Nor does it mean the yarn can be 
purchased in the US for so little either.&nbsp; Where many often use one yarn 
for a design, I often use three myself.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s a jump in cost 
for me.&nbsp; Plus there&rsquo;s the value of other elements, like antique 
buttons or sterling silver findings.</p> 
<p>And then we come to the aspect of time and of skill.&nbsp; What would you 
pay an expert to do and what would you pay a beginner?&nbsp; There should be a 
difference.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something to be said for a skill that has been 
honed over time.&nbsp; Because the quality of labor is much different.&nbsp; 
Why should an expert be paid the same as a beginner?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a 
reason why we pay doctors what we do, they are highly educated, trained and 
skilled.</p> 
<p>But let&rsquo;s say we have a beginner.&nbsp; Federal minimum wage is $7.25 
an hour.&nbsp; Even people receiving training to flip burgers get at least 
minimum wage.&nbsp; If an item requires $30 of materials and takes 4 hours to 
make, you have at minimum a $59 item, before taxes.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; What if 
you decide not to charge minimum wage?&nbsp; Even at $5 an hour (a minimum 
suggestion fromCrochet Liberation Front founder, Laurie Wheeler), you still 
have a $50 price tag.&nbsp; At minimum.&nbsp; For beginner grade work.</p> 
<p>I like some points Laurie made on this subject in previous years on the 
Crochet Liberation Front forum,<em>&ldquo;The best way I know of raising the 
value of anything, is to value it yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p>Followed up in her article last year &ldquo;At What Price?&rdquo; Laurie 
has this to say:</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FUZZY DO NOT&hellip;and I 
repeat&hellip;DO NOT UNDERSELL YOUR WORK!!&nbsp; &hellip;. Materials + Time x 
Skill = $$&hellip;. Time is valuable. Especially in today&rsquo;s fast paced 
world, time is PRECIOUS, your time&nbsp;is VALUABLE.&nbsp;If you spend 2hrs on 
a &nbsp;hat and you spent $3 on the materials and you only charge $4.00, $3.00 
covers the materials and you just made FIFTY CENTS an hour. Really?&nbsp; You 
are not a SWEATSHOP&hellip;You are WORTH more than that&hellip; &ldquo;</em></p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve heard many women make comments that should never be made, 
like: &ldquo;Oh but I enjoy doing this so I don&rsquo;t charge very 
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; WHAT? Seriously? Did I just hear that?&nbsp; SO you should 
only get paid for what you<em>don&rsquo;t</em> derive a sense of satisfaction 
from?&nbsp; (I&rsquo;ve never heard a man say something like this, btw.)&nbsp; 
If you&rsquo;ve ever been guilty of saying something like that, stop and 
consider the craziness of what you&rsquo;re suggesting.&nbsp; Not to mention 
how it undervalues the work of all hand crafters when you do that, including 
the ones who rely on selling their wares to put food on the table.&nbsp; Just 
because you don&rsquo;t have to rely on it to feed your kids, doesn&rsquo;t 
mean you should undersell your work.</p> 
<p>Factors to keep in mind as you consider pricing also include rarity, how 
labor intensive, precision of the work, and expertise and range of experience. 
Some items, you&rsquo;ll have to judge.&nbsp; You may have to tweak your prices 
or process a bit here and there.&nbsp; Just because you are capable of making 
wash cloths out of cashmere doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s practical and that 
everyone will buy one for what it&rsquo;s worth or at all.&nbsp; Hmmm&hellip; 
So maybe there&rsquo;s a cap there somewhere on what kind of materials you 
expect to use for what items and the price range most of your customers will 
fall into?</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s also travel time, packing materials and postage.&nbsp; If 
I&rsquo;m doing custom orders and find myself driving all over town from yarn 
shop to yarn shop trying to find what will make my customer happy, it becomes 
an expense that has to be accounted for, because they want a custom item and 
not something I have ready to go.&nbsp; And it requires me to take time off 
from my regular business and work only for them until they get what they 
want.&nbsp; That can be a lot of time, especially if they don&rsquo;t really 
know what they want or it&rsquo;s difficult to secure!&nbsp; Think about the 
fees you would pay a graphic artist when you don&rsquo;t have a clear idea of 
what you want.&nbsp; Usually you get one or two proofs and that&rsquo;s 
it.&nbsp; Consider that custom handmade should not be much different.</p> 
<p>So when you&rsquo;re pricing, you have a lot to consider for 
variables.&nbsp; And once you have that, stick with it and do not let buyers 
bargain with you.&nbsp; Not only is it poor form at shows, but when you do it, 
you give people permission to essentially cut your pay!&nbsp; Set a fair and 
reasonable price, based on the variables we&rsquo;re discussing and decide 
ahead of the show how you will deal with such requests.&nbsp; If you want to 
offer a discount for multiple purchases, that can be nice, but price your 
individual items accordingly so you are still coming out on top in the end. Do 
not stoop to the rude folks either.&nbsp; They are not your market.&nbsp; Be 
polite, but do not waste your time on them.&nbsp; You want to know at the end 
of the year, after all those last-minute material purchases and all the time 
invested and you sit down to do those taxes, that it was worth it.&nbsp; If you 
never stand up for yourself, who will?</p> 
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve read all this and taken stock, how much are you 
worth?&nbsp; Think about it and add to the discussion in the comments!&nbsp;
