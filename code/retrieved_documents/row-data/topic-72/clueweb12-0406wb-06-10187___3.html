<b>Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen Both OK for Kids</b> <br>
<i>

<p> NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Ibuprofen (in painkillers such as Advil) and 
acetaminophen (for example, Tylenol) both appear to treat children's common 
aches and pains equally safely and well -- based on a review of published 
medical studies. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>&quot;There has been a tendency for (general practitioners), pediatricians, 
pharmacists and nurses to emphasize the common perception that acetaminophen is 
safer than ibuprofen,&quot; study author Dr. David A. Perrott told Reuters 
Health. &quot;But, taken as a whole, the studies we reviewed provide no 
evidence that one drug is any less safe than the other,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perrott cautioned that these findings are based on scant research comparing 
how well and safely ibuprofen and acetaminophen work for children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine report, he 
and his colleagues recommend &quot;more research&quot; into the safety and 
effectiveness of these two drugs in treating kids' pain or fever from ailments 
such as headaches, muscle aches and colds or the flu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the most common treatments used 
to relieve pain and fever. Research in adults suggests that the two drugs stack 
up equally well, yet investigations into their use in children have yielded 
mixed results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To get a clearer picture, Perrott and colleagues reviewed 17 trials 
involving children and teens less than 18 years old &quot;receiving either drug 
to treat fever or moderate to severe pain.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The investigators found that both drugs appeared to treat children's pain 
equally well, although ibuprofen appeared somewhat better at reducing fever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both drugs also appeared to be equally safe, and just as harmless as an 
inactive placebo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perrott, who is now based at TrialGraphix in Chicago, explained that 
ibuprofen may do a slightly better job of reducing kids' fever than 
acetaminophen partly because it relies on a different mechanism to reduce 
temperature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added that the current study looks only at instances where kids got a 
single, regulated dose of the drugs. &quot;We did not review studies examining 
what happens when you take combinations of the drugs or repeated doses over 
time,&quot; Perrott noted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The study was partly funded by Boots Healthcare Australia Pty Ltd, a 
division of Boots Healthcare International, which makes a form of ibuprofen.</p>
