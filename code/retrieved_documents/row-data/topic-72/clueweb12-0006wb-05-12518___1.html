<p> </p> <b>Little Pim DVDs for English</b> <br>
 Meet Little Pim, a charming 
animated panda who guides babies, toddlers and preschoolers on a fun-filled 
journey to learning a foreign language. Little Pim only speaks in the foreign 
language, while interacting with babies and young children enjoying everyday 
activities. We encourage you to watch Little Pim with your child and join the 
onscreen fun by calling out words and repeating the language together. Because 
Little Pim focuses on the first words typically acquired in a kid?s vocabulary, 
your family can reinforce the lessons by simply repeating the new language 
during your everyday routines. Studies show that exposing young children to a 
foreign language facilitates fluency later in life and could also enhance 
cognitive abilities. Created by Julia Pimsleur Levine, an award-winning 
filmmaker and mom, Little Pim is a groundbreaking kids? language DVD series 
that offers hours of fun while providing the basic building blocks for learning 
a foreign language. This multi-disc series of 35-minute DVDs can be viewed in 
any order, with each DVD teaching 60 words of vocabulary. Special features 
include: 5-minute episodes to facilitate pausing for interaction; vocabulary 
review after each segment; optional English subtitles; parent guide with 
helpful viewing and learning tips. Comes in three DVDs:<b>Eating and Drinking:
</b> follow Little Pim and pals as they wake up to a new day and go to sleep 
after a busy day;<b>Wake Up Smiling:</b> follow Little Pim and pals as they 
wake up to a new day and go to sleep after a busy day;<b>Playtime:</b> join 
Little Pim and pals in the wonders of play, from blocks to boats to tea time.
