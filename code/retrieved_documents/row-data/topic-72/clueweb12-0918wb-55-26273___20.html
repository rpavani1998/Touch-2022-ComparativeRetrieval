<h2>Tablet Schmablet Redux</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, innovation, 
Mobile Technologies <br>

<p>Along time ago I wrote a post questioning the added value of a tablet 
computer in a<em>teacher&rsquo;s</em> hands.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ll shortly have access to a new class of tablets, slates, whatever 
you want to call them, or at least we should very shortly.</p> 
<p>There appears to be new technologies emerging from Apple, OLPC, Dell, 
NotionInk , and yes, even Google.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s even the Mag+, which 
seems to be more reader than anything else.</p> 
<p>Do I want one.&nbsp; You bet I do.</p> 
<p>And when they appear, especially the Apple product (expected January 26, 
2010), can&rsquo;t you just see the Twitter firestorm?&nbsp; And if you thought 
the lines at the local Apple store were long for the iPhone, just wait&hellip;
</p> 
<p>So, what does this mean for education?</p> 
<p>Probably very little.&nbsp; With a price point that is anticipated 
well-beyond the price of a netbook (with the exception of the OLPC at around 
$100,predicted by Forbes.com to come in at $75 bucks), your local school, and 
their limited budgets will have very little wiggle room for acquiring these 
devices.</p> 
<p>And they shouldn&rsquo;t anyway, because most are far from having the 
organizational readiness required to plan for, implement, support, sustain, and 
evaluate any kind of program that places these technologies in a<em>
student&rsquo;s</em> hands.</p> 
<p>In the middle of all of this, across a gradient that ranges from the 
desktop/laptop on the left, to the future tabets on the right, is the 
netbook.&nbsp; Interestingly, some have predicted thatthis will mean the end of 
the netbook.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that, and I won&rsquo;t speculate, but I&rsquo;m 
hoping it makes them even more affordable, so that I can get my hands on more 
of them.</p> 
<p>That means getting more of them into classrooms, of course, where teachers 
and kids can beat them up, so we can see how all of these technologies play out 
in the context of our school-wide technology and literacy goal (<strong>
Incorporate new and evolving technologies to support the development of 
literacy.)</strong></p> 
<p>The eventual access to a machine that will support many of the same 
features many of us enjoy on an iPhone or Android is fascinating.&nbsp; And 
there is no doubt that these will probably make us all rethink what mobile 
computing looks like.</p> 
<p>But just not in schools.</p> 
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Apple Tablet apparently to ship in March.&nbsp; See Mashable 
for the story.</p>

<h2>Integrity or Dishonesty?</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Education, 
Learning, tags: davidjakes djakes academicdishonesty academicintegrity <br>

<p>As more social technologies and processes enter the classroom, new 
questions arise about how these tools/processes serve teaching and learning. As 
many of you know, many of these tools have the potential to create dynamic 
learning environments where students interact with each other in new ways and 
with information and content in new ways. It&rsquo;s my belief that we must 
have some very honest conversations about our perceptions regarding this 
interaction, especially in regards to our belief about academic integrity (a 
term I favor over academic dishonesty).</p> 
<p>Take social bookmarking for instance. Suppose you are a biology teacher who 
has asked students to research a variety of topics in life science-for example, 
stem cell research. Let&rsquo;s suppose three students have chosen this topic 
and are working on answering an essential question regarding the ethical 
considerations of this type of biological research and are doing so 
independently. Let&rsquo;s also say that each has an account at a social 
bookmarking site like del.icio.us (yeah, I still like typing the periods) and 
has tagged a variety of resources about stem cell research. Each is aware of 
each other del.icio.us sites but no formal collaborative effort is required by 
the teacher (that&rsquo;s another post). Student A knowingly goes to Student B 
and C&rsquo;s site, examines the tag for stemcellresearch, finds some new 
resources, and tags them into their account at del.icio.us.</p> 
<p>Appropriate? Or a violation of academic integrity?</p> 
<p>I think you would be absolutely amazed at the responses you would get from 
a group of teachers. Many would consider this cheating and would equate the 
process to a situation where one student had photocopied several research 
articles, left them on a table, and then another student came along and took 
them.</p> 
<p>Today&rsquo;s &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; is tomorrow&rsquo;s collaboration.</p> 
<p>Anyone with a del.icio.us account knows that calling the actions of the 
above student inappropriate is absolute nonsense and that the ability to reach 
into another account to see resources is part of the game.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s. Called. A. Network. And it&rsquo;s called social bookmarking 
for a reason, isn&rsquo;t it?</p> 
<p>Of course, this arises because most teachers do not have such an account 
and do not understand how participation in a social network can be leveraged to 
improve what one can do. But this lack of understanding is very real, and 
represents challenges to daily instruction, as well as policy regarding 
technology and teaching and learning.</p> 
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had that discussion, I urge you to try it. </p> 
<p>Here is another scenario. Suppose a student subscribes to the tag 
stemcellresearch in del.icio.us. This means that you will receive every 
resource tagged worldwide by all del.icio.us users. Let&rsquo;s say Student A 
does this, goes into the subscription area of del.icio.us, and examines the 
resources, and tags several into their account. Would you consider this to be 
part of a research process? Again, I think you would be surprised. Many will 
say they want students to find the information themselves&hellip;.</p> 
<p>Many have not yet considered that information flow is in two directions. 
You can find it, and it can find you. In my classroom, this process would be 
taught, encouraged, expected, and evaluated as part of a student&rsquo;s 
ability to ask a question of importance to them, and to be able to develop a 
response.</p> 
<p>For some, such a process is completely out of the question. It&rsquo;s not 
how we&rsquo;ve done things.</p> 
<p>The two scenarios above relate only to social bookmarking and as a result, 
consider only one component of a complex social system for information sharing 
and learning. We still have a long way to go before we understand, and 
negotiate systemically, what these collaborative sharing environments mean to 
student learning.</p> 
<p>No wonder these tools, and the environments they create, are labeled 
disruptive.</p>

<h2>Side Pocket</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Education, innovation, 
Learning, tags: jakes djakes innovation cosn <br>

<p>How innovative are you? </p> 
<p>Like the concept of best practice, defining what constitutes innovation is 
probably a relative term and a moving target at best. What is innovative for 
one teacher might not necessarily be considered so innovative for another. 
I&rsquo;m not so sure that there is a clear line in the sand where something, 
some practice, some technique, or someone, becomes labeled as innovative. I 
think you know innovation when you see it.</p> 
<p>If you are a teacher, you probably know the teachers in your building who 
are considered to be the true innovators. They&rsquo;re fairly easy to 
recognize. You might admire these people, and at the same time, you might 
resent them. If you&rsquo;re an administrator, you&rsquo;re probably not so 
sure about these teachers either-in some cases these individuals might be 
viewed as a nuisance or worse yet-as a potential threat. These individuals are 
constantly pushing the envelope, and are probably the source of the next volley 
of policy writing, agenda items at faculty meetings, notes to &ldquo;see me in 
my office&rdquo; or worse yet, calls home to parents. Others may see these 
teachers as incredibly valuable-they can point to these teachers as examples of 
innovation in their buildings and models for their peers. </p> 
<p>In 2009, pockets of innovation aren&rsquo;t enough. </p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune of being able to travel to quite a few 
conferences across the United States, and some in Canada, Europe and most 
recently China. I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to surround myself with people 
that are truly innovative and I&rsquo;m better for it. You can see them in the 
school I work in, you see others writing about their ideas in blogs, you see 
them at conferences, those that step out on the edge and test themselves, push 
themselves in new directions. Sometimes they fail, but most often they succeed, 
however failure itself is seen as a success, and an adventure in the direction 
of learning, which in itself, is reward enough for these individuals.</p> 
<p>In my opinion, too many schools are satisfied with having pockets of 
innovation. </p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sincere question: does your school equate being innovative 
with being excellent? If you do, rethink that and rethink it quickly. 
They&rsquo;re not the same, and one doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the other.</p> 
<p>Of course, the easiest way to be &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; is to jump feet 
first into the waters of Web 2.0. Be the first to use a wiki, be the first to 
podcast, be the first to blog, be the first to say one of my kids got a comment 
from Argentina, and that&rsquo;s great faculty lunch room fodder. But it just 
doesn&rsquo;t mean much&hellip;sorry, it just doesn&rsquo;t. There are much 
more important things at stake.</p> 
<p>You can also be a seen as an innovator among your professional peers, and 
this of course is a very nice type of recognition. It can be very gratifying. 
Simply join Twitter to find out how much.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in being satisfied with pockets of innovation. 
Yes, they can be recognized, which for many schools, is the end point and the 
final rest stop of innovation. There can certainly be more however, with those 
same pockets analyzed for what works and why, amplified to increase their 
visibility and importance, and systematized to make a difference for all. </p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the systemic application of technology to teaching 
and learning. I&rsquo;m interested in an equitable experience for all students. 
I&rsquo;m not satisfied with some kids getting a rich experience in technology; 
I&rsquo;d like all kids in a school to interact with the technologies that 
support the instructional techniques that lead to increased student achievement.
</p> 
<p>If you are an innovator, then you perhaps can be a leader in the change 
process that enlarges innovation, and that indeed, can potentially be 
considered a component of what constitutes excellence. If you&rsquo;re not on 
board with a leadership role, then follow but follow well. And if you 
won&rsquo;t follow with the best of intentions, stop reading this and grab your 
ditto master. There&rsquo;s duplicating to be done. </p> 
<p>When it&rsquo;s all said and done, this is a leadership issue, pure and 
simple-just like everything else in schools.</p> 
<p>The recent release of the CoSN Report, Leadership for Web 2.0 in Education: 
Promise &amp; Reality has eight major findings, and focuses the viewpoints of 
leadership. Does Finding 7 surprise you? </p> 
<p>&ldquo;While there was broad agreement that Web 2.0 applications hold 
educational value, the use of these tools in American classrooms remains the 
province of individual pioneering classrooms.&rdquo; (p.11)</p> 
<p>and, Finding 8, which is troubling, but probably has been true for a long 
period of time regarding technology, not just Web 2.0:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Web 2.0 is outpacing K-12 education&rsquo;s current capacity to 
innovate.&rdquo; (p 11)</p> 
<p>And then, Finding 9: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&ldquo;District administrators, the persons responsible for decision making 
on Web 2.0 in schools, are more passive than active users in the Web 2.0 space. 
(p 12).</p> 
<p>Changing Finding 7 and Finding 8 begins with changing Finding 9&hellip;.</p>

<h2>Un-Common(s) Value</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Informal Learning, 
innovation, Learning, tags: djakes informallearning davidjakes ipods ipodtouch 
<br> 
<p>My Dad taught ceramics for 38 years. I was always amazed at what his 
students produced-and that he could access that hidden capacity in them and 
bring it forth to create a personal piece of art. He would always tell me that 
everyone has that talent; it just has to be accessed and developed. He did it 
with the most difficult kids in school, and usually with multiple sections, all 
in one class. And he never let it pass that the piece they produced would still 
be on their mantle 30 years from now when my science tests wand labs were long 
forgotten&hellip;Many of those kids just came to school just for his class and 
then left.</p> 
<p>My new school is a different place than where my Dad taught. We have a 
commons area, comprised of the cafeterias, a beautiful student activities 
center with an open-air courtyard, our library, and a wide area of hallway 
where multiple hallways come together in an area that creates a large open 
space. Kids have access to travel through all of these areas during their open 
periods.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual to see a student playing a guitar in this area in an 
impromptu coffeehouse session. It took me a while to get used to this type of 
space, and the openness it affords (kids also can use ipods), but kids like it 
as you might imagine, and it generally works pretty well.</p> 
<p>Another observation about my new school: the kids in our school actually 
like coming to school. Having a few freedoms like the commons area is only a 
part of that, and those freedoms provide an environment that enable kids to 
connect with other kids.</p> 
<p>Simply stated, successful teachers, and successful schools, find ways to 
develop and deepen those connections. Those connections typically occur, and 
are probably expected to occur in formal traditional learning spaces, i.e. 
classrooms. But what about informal learning opportunities, and the connections 
they afford? How well do we do in providing opportunities for informal learning 
to take place? Of course the danger in that is that we probably don&rsquo;t 
want to formalize the informal and take away the essence of that experience. 
But we need these types of spaces, and opportunities for exploration beyond the 
classroom to be available inside of schools. And we need to support that with 
dollars and tools, with adults, and perhaps with policies that enable them to 
use the very tools that we ask them to lock away&hellip;</p> 
<p>So when I saw this video, I thought of all of that.</p> 
<p>Here are kids using their iphones and ipod Touch&rsquo;s, and a variety of 
apps, to play music. I can see kids doing this in our open areas, and I can see 
them doing this in our V-Show (Variety Show), perhaps even part of a club. 
Couldn&rsquo;t you see kids downloadiing ana cappella from ccmixter and adding 
their ipod Touch instrumental to it, and contributing it back?That would 
obviously be pretty cool. But what would they learn? Certainly it would be an 
opportunity to teach them about remix culture, something that most do now and 
not very well, and something that they will interact with for the rest of their 
lives. For me, that&rsquo;s huge, and it adds additional authenticity and 
relevancy.I can also see kids using these tools as part of a music class. Why 
not? Would we get pushback from music educators? Administrators? Parents?Would 
experiences like this potentially attract more student to music? Or should we 
leave them to do all of this on their own? Would we be too intrusive?I 
don&rsquo;t think so.</p> 
<p>And speaking of the ipod Touch and the iPhone, shouldn&rsquo;t we be 
teaching kids how to develop applications form them? Stanford offers afree 
10-week online course, with content available at their iTunes site. Should we 
publicize that, encourage that kind of learning, and provide assistance when 
necessary? I wonder how many teachers have taken this course, on their own, and 
brought their own informal learning back to class?</p> 
<p>We are still a school. We have a responsibility to teach kids, and we 
should do so with everything at our disposal. If that means using an ipod Touch 
in a music class then so be it. If it means saying that you can use yourpersonal
 ipod Touch to play music in school, then so be it.</p> 
<p>We also have a responsibility to extend our expectations of what learning 
is, and where it can take place. Technology today permits learning to take 
place without the limitations of time, space, and place. A hallway, a commons 
area, can be a learning space. It doesn&rsquo;t have have to be a classroom. 
And we don&rsquo;t necessarily have to structure it for them. Providing the 
opportunity and structuring and controlling the opportunity are different 
things, aren&rsquo;t they?</p> 
<p>We also have a responsibility to find ways to provide experiences for those 
that cannot afford these technologies at home. And that means doing so at 
school.</p> 
<p>The more that kids are connect to each other, to adults, and to the school 
community, the more ways we can find to develop talent, the more environments 
for learning that we provide and support, both formal and informal, the better 
off our schools will be.</p> 
<p>The better off the kids will be.</p> 
<p>UPDATE: be sure to read this interesting perception of informal learning, 
with a new term I had never heard of to describe mobile devices&hellip;</p>

<h2>Degree of Difficulty</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Education, Learning
,Literacy, tags: djakes, jakes, Literacy, web2.0 <br>

<p>How difficult is all of this?&nbsp; </p> 
<p>In diving, there is something called a reverse one and a half somersaults 
with three and a half twists, in something called the free position.&nbsp; Me, 
I&rsquo;d just do a cannonball. Not a pretty image, I know.</p> 
<p>When you go into a high end coffee shop, people can order a Grande White 
Mocha Frappuccino.&nbsp; Me, I order a black coffee.&nbsp; Large.&nbsp; Not 
Grande.&nbsp;Just large, like me, thank you very much.</p> 
<p>Ok, so what I&rsquo;m wondering about is the complexity, and perhaps the 
unnecessary complexity, of all this Web 2.0 stuff and what it means for schools.
&nbsp;Add in the discussion on skills versus literacy versus fluency, personal 
learning networks, and the changing landscape of classroom instruction and what 
is now possible, and for the most part, it&rsquo;s simply overwhelming.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m not discounting the importance of all of this of course, just 
wondering if we make it all too complex.&nbsp; But it sure is fun to talk about 
it, isn&rsquo;t it.</p> 
<p>For those of you deeply embedded in connective technologies, do you think, 
given the context of the typical school and the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; classroom 
teacher, that part of the resistance to all of this is the &ldquo;entrance 
energy&rdquo; required to take part and become a participant in what appears to 
be a very fast-paced, rapidly changing,<em>and complex</em>, teaching and 
learning environment?&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, there is only so much 
energy&hellip;and for those of us working in schools, we know that these new 
discussions and the new capacities that ultimately may arise from them, are a 
small part, and in some cases, a very small part, of the overall job of running 
a school.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step backward.&nbsp; Take teaching for instance.&nbsp; 
What really is the secret of being a good, effective teacher?&nbsp; Is this a 
complex question?&nbsp; Basically, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s actually pretty 
simple:&nbsp; be prepared, be enthusiastic, be honest, be fair, and get 
involved in their lives.&nbsp; Nothing top secret here, but generally if you 
fit that bill, you&rsquo;re probably are a pretty good teacher.&nbsp; Not that 
complex at all.</p> 
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got 21st Century Skills, NCTE&rsquo;s Definition of the 21st
 Century Literacies, the National Council for the Social Studies Statement on 
Media Literacy, NETS-T, NETS-A, NETS-S, the KnowledgeWorks Foundation&rsquo;s 
2020 Forecast on Learning, PEW Surveys, great stuff from Educause, School 2.0, 
blog posts,new discussion forums, podcasts on impending revolutions, and of 
course, the never &ndash;ending flow of information in Twitter.&nbsp; A lot of 
this is absolutely great stuff, and important stuff.<strong>UPDATE:</strong>
&nbsp;<strong>Be sure to read Ryan Bretag&rsquo;s excellent post &ldquo;What is 
Your Department Discussing and Doing&rdquo; to see additional perspectives from 
a variety of groups (ACOT, NCTM, NSTA)&nbsp; not mentioned in my post.</strong>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;But just where do you look first?</p> 
<p>So, consider this question.&nbsp; Is this really that hard?&nbsp; Do you 
really need to consider all the pieces above?&nbsp; Or, is it a more simple set 
of considerations, and are we smart enough already?&nbsp;What skills do you 
want kids to exhibit?&nbsp; What technology tools can serve the learning 
processes that help build those skills, and extendthe learning experience to a 
new place, as a result of the technology being included?&nbsp; How do we 
structure the lesson, or lessons, so that these skills can be developed?&nbsp; 
How do we assess it so that we know what we set out to do?&nbsp; And how do we 
make it all replicable?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s time to simplify.&nbsp; This is not that hard.&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>Just order the black coffee.</strong></p>

<h2>9 Dots</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Conferences, innovation, tags:

<p>9 Dots</p> 
<p>View SlideShare presentation or Upload your own. (tags: innovation web2.0)
</p> 
<p>Here is the slidedeck from my presentation at Google Teacher Academy in 
Chicago. The topic was innovation. Here is the script&hellip;.</p> 
<p>______</p> 
<p>In 1997 Apple challenged us to think different.</p> 
<p>In 2008, that message resonates even louder and with greater urgency.</p> 
<p>That ad campaign honored a wide range of people of accomplishment. One such 
individual was James Watson.</p> 
<p>In 1954, along with Francis Crick, Watson described the structure of the 
DNA molecule. Watson and Crick were awarded the Nobel Prize for their efforts.
</p> 
<p>Here is Watson, on the left, Crick on the right, examining their model.</p> 
<p>If you will recall your high school biology class, DNA is made up to two 
complimentary strands, wound around each other in what is known as a 
double-helix. DNA is the raw material of your chromosomes, and each of you has 
46 in each body cell. Sections of your chromosomes are called genes. When genes 
are expressed in combination with environmental factors, they determine your 
traits.</p> 
<p>DNA can be recombined in different combinations to yield very different 
results, even in siblings.</p> 
<p>Different species have different chromosomes and genes which make them 
unique, but they still have DNA as their genetic material.</p> 
<p>Science has even provided us with the understanding of how to manipulate 
DNA, giving rise to the field of genetic engineering.</p> 
<p>In 2008, we have common technology that provides us with the raw material 
or platform for expressing our thoughts, our creativity, our innovation, really 
ourselves. We can mix and remix content and tools in a recombinant dance, to 
extend and create. To innovate.</p> 
<p>In 2008, it is not unreasonable to think of these technologies as our 
&ldquo;digital DNA.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Of course, these tools range from the 140 character conversations of 
Twitter, to Second Life with our digital but DNA-less identity, and with a host 
of Web 2.0 tools in the middle.</p> 
<p>More importantly, the suite of Google Tools, from Gmail to Google Earth, 
provides educators with unparalleled access to the type of imaginative 
environment that can be used to &ldquo;think different.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In 1997, would you have imagined what think different could be mean in 2008?
</p> 
<p>Today, you have an opportunity to think different. Today you have an 
opportunity to surround yourself with people of like talents, that have a like 
purpose. Today can be one of those days that change how you approach your craft 
and career.</p> 
<p>For today, and for tomorrow, think beyond the nine dots.</p> 
<p>The challenge of this puzzle is connect all the dots without lifting the 
pen or pencil and to do so in 4 lines.</p> 
<p>Most will try and solve this by drawing lines within the boundaries of the 
dots. Not until you extend your thinking beyond your self-imposed boundaries, 
will the puzzle be solved.</p> 
<p>There are numerous pathways for using technology successfully. This 
conference enables you to see a clear pathway for just that.</p> 
<p>Remember, thinking different with the help of Google begins today.</p>

<h2>Tragedy of the Commons</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Education, 
Personal, Twitter <br>

<p>When I taught ecology, my students studied the concept of &ldquo;The 
Tragedy of the Commons,&rdquo; which was popularized by an ecologist by the 
name ofGarrett Hardin.</p> 
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s about the exploitation of a commonly shared resource. 
When all who share the resource play by the rules and share equally all 
benefit, while the resource generally remains intact and capable of sustaining 
future use. However, given human nature, a single member (or more) may 
eventually consume more of his/her share of the resource, prompting all to be 
more aggressive and utilize more, in an escalating pattern of consumption. 
Gradually, through this process the resource, or &ldquo;The Commons,&rdquo; is 
destroyed.</p> 
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this for awhile, but I can see 
parallels between this concept and what I believe is an exploitation of the new 
digital commons-I&rsquo;m talking Twitter here.</p> 
<p>At its best, Twitter is a place to share a resource, a link to a new blog 
post, or an insight, and even a place to have a little fun. It&rsquo;s a place 
that could be about learning. At its very worst, Twitter is a self-indulgent 
exercise in self-promotion and pettiness. </p> 
<p>Right now, I think we are watching Twitter change right before our digital 
eyes. Be the first with the tool (Diigo, for example), be the first with a 
post, be the first with the wiki, be the first to uStream, stake your claim in 
a never-ending game of name building and recognition. Take advantage of the 
commons, go ahead. But where will that eventually lead to?</p> 
<p>In my opinion, Twitter really has also changed how some people interact, 
and not in a positive way. When did the defacto standard greeting at a 
conference become &ldquo;Hi, I follow you on Twitter.&rdquo; How about 
&ldquo;Good Morning?&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t follow me.&rdquo; 
Gee, sorry, not my responsibility&hellip;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When did getting called out for not following someone become something you 
did? When did sending an email to someone who doesn&rsquo;t follow you, and you 
want to know why, become something you did? How absolutely ridiculous! Get over 
it. Do you want it that bad-is it really that important? Seriously!</p> 
<p><em>What about connecting to share ideas in the service of learning?</em> 
</p> 
<p>When did it become about becoming noticed, when did it become about taking 
your rightful place in the line of technology &ldquo;experts.&rdquo; When did 
it become about &ldquo;cocktail parties&rdquo; and &ldquo;inner circles?&rdquo; 
And since I&rsquo;m thinking about it, I&rsquo;m wondering if the people 
promoting the idea of ridiculous idea of a cocktail party or inner circle would 
be the first wanting to join if such a thing actually existed?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What happened?</p> 
<p>Take Educon 2.0. It&rsquo;s Friday and if you were there, you had the 
opportunity to visit the kids and teachers of the  Science  Leadership  Academy 
. However, most stayed in the library bantering about Twitter and finally 
meeting those people in real life that had become some important in their 
digital one. What a missed opportunity to observe a truly unique school.</p> 
<p>So here comes NECC, with the Blogger Caf&eacute; and EdubloggerCon. I can 
only imagine what a scrum for attention those could potentially turn into. But 
EdubloggerCon provides the opportunity for those who have blogged and twittered 
for a year to step up-let&rsquo;s hear what you have to say face to face. Are 
you ready for that? Are you ready to earn it-really earn it?<br>
</p> 
<p>The more I think about all this Twitter nonsense, the more I think about 
fundamentals. Writing. Commenting. Reading in your aggregator. Putting links 
into del.icio.us and supporting that network. Reading research. Reading outside 
of the ecochamber. Reflecting, questioning, getting uncomfortable&mdash;and 
then perhaps challenging the assumptions of your foundation. Personal growth. 
How can I grow and change as an educator? What can I do better to help kids 
learn?</p> 
<p>And then put it into practice. What worked, what didn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>Put that into Twitter.</p> 
<p>Twitter has diverted many from what is important, what should be the true 
goal. And that&rsquo;s the real tragedy&hellip;</p>

<h2>A Single Word</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Assessment, Classrooms, Education, 
tags:assessment Web2.0 <br>

<p>When I was at CUE, I had the opportunity to see Vince Cerf do the opening 
keynote presentation. He gave a very interesting keynote, and one thing really 
stuck with me, and it was about what constituted a contribution in a networked 
environment.</p> 
<p>Mr. Cerf suggested that we would never publish a single word as a book, as 
a journal article, or magazine article. He continued by saying that in a Web 
2.0 world that included Wikipedia,<em>you could and would publish a single word
</em>, and most importantly, it could be a <strong>significant contribution
</strong>.</p> 
<p>So, last night in Dean Shareski&rsquo;s uStream session, many of us had a 
very interesting discussion about online contribution, and levels of 
contribution.Clarence Fisher was the guest and he was talking about his ideas 
relative to the classroom as a studio as well as what it meant to improve 
information. Some interesting ideas from the chat:</p> 
<p>Jeff Utecht: How would you assess a student who changed a single word?<br>

Ryan Bretag: Think about contributing one word from a poetry standpoint, how 
critical is one word? Writing in a hypertext society makes that one world 
critical.<br>
 EdtechVision: (paraphrasing here). How would peer assessment 
enter into this?</p> 
<p>Personally, I think you can begin by taking a look at Darren 
Kuropatwa&rsquo;s framework for hisclassroom wiki, where he defines what a 
significant contribution is and what a constructive modification means.</p> 
<p>Back in the chat, after much discussion, a single question was distilled:
</p> 
<p><em>How do you assess contribution in a networked classroom? </em></p> 
<p>Ok, so what does it look like? What&rsquo;s new, what&rsquo;s different, 
what&rsquo;s the same? Your ideas?</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Personal <br>

<p>I am fortunate to serve as Instructional Technology Coordinator for my 
school district. Not many school districts have a position like mine, which is 
solely focused on improving teaching and learning with the tools of technology. 
No boxes. No wires. Just 24/7/186 Instructional Technology. Then the summer to 
get ready to do it all over again&hellip;time to retool, rethink, clarify, 
redirect, build and create&hellip;and get better at what I do, and help my 
school district to become better at what we do together.</p> 
<p>But what does the job really look like, and what is required of a person in 
this position?</p> 
<p>My week really never has a beginning or end, but if I could identify a 
single starting point, it&rsquo;s probably Sunday afternoon, right after the 
Bears game, because the phone calls from teachers start. How do I do this? How 
should I proceed? Can I reserve one of the mobile labs for tomorrow? And of 
course&hellip;my favorite&hellip; I lost my password&hellip;here you go.</p> 
<p>To stay current, I process 186 RSS feeds. Much of that information, 
resources, and creative thought go into mydel.icio.us account, where 233 other 
del.icio.us users tap into what I do. Some of those ideas get repurposed into 
my blog posts here or at<em>The Strength of Weak Ties</em>. Much of that 
becomes internalized in how I do my job, and that translates directly in my 
ability to support classroom teachers with ideas on how to make learning come 
alive. Some of it also finds its way to other administrators, so that I can be 
a resource for helping them make proper decisions regarding a wide-variety of 
topics, ranging from professional development to school reform. It&rsquo;s 
about developing the deep and wide reservoir of experience and understanding 
that is required to lead a large school district with something as important as 
technology.</p> 
<p>To stay current, I also read. Books. Magazines, Journal Articles. I even 
have all of this stuff in my car. Just ask my fellow administrators. I&rsquo;ve 
even got a toaster.<em>Just. In. Case.</em></p> 
<p>To stay current, as well as contribute to my profession, I present at 
conferences. I&rsquo;ve beenpresenting nationally since 1995 and have done 
numerous spotlights and am finally getting keynote opportunities. Why is this 
important? Presenting at conferences is about sharing, and my perspective on 
presenting is to specifically represent to a larger audience what we do, and do 
well. Here it is, here is how it works, here is why it is valuable, and here is 
how you can do it too. Think that&rsquo;s easy? Go stand in front of 500 
critics and put yourself, and your school district, out there-you better be 
ready, you&rsquo;d better have good stuff, you better be prepared, and you 
better be able to contribute. Because that&rsquo;s why those people are there. 
But more importantly, the presentation simply honors what we do-everything that 
goes into that presentation represents a great deal of hard work by a large 
number of people, teachers, students, and administrators. And guess 
what-we&rsquo;re proud of it, and we&rsquo;re going to tell people. Here we are 
and here is what we can do! Take advantage of our experiences and 
expertise&hellip;.we want to be a leader in this.</p> 
<p>There is also a great deal of power in the preparation for that 
presentation&hellip;the prep is reflective, and gives me time to think about 
the evaluation of the experience against learning goals. As a profession, we 
need to begin to think about the value the technology has in the learning 
experience. We evaluate the learning, but do we evaluate the role of the 
technology in that learning? To be the best, you have to. That&rsquo;s just 
non-negotiable.</p> 
<p>A great deal of my time is spent managing our Blackboard presence, which 
contains a suite of tools that give our teachers access to a number of tools 
that can drive learning. And before you go there, it works for us, because 
being an Instructional Technology Coordinator means you understand what your 
climate and culture is, and what you realistically can and can&rsquo;t use, 
despite the fact that you might like to use other tools. It&rsquo;s about the 
organization and not you. And so you use it to the best of your ability, and 
build capability, expertise, and learning opportunities with it. You outfit it 
with blogs and wikis, with Turnitin.com, with WebAssign. You support it 
passionately and relentlessly, and you provide professional development 
opportunities that have entry points for a variety of users, and that move them 
down a continuum towards more effective use. And you also do those professional 
development experiences with the very teachers that have the expertise, because 
there is nothing like building capacity, nothing like building community, 
nothing like building a common shared direction.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m very proud of our Blackboard use but I&rsquo;m especially proud 
of our digital storytelling program, which has been in our schools for over 
four years. How many kids have created digital stories? Literally thousands 
have. And in a world where video is exploding, where there is YouTube, 
TeacherTube, SchoolTube,DNATube, and undoubtably other &ldquo;tubes&rdquo; on 
the way, the ability to create content, distribute content, and create a 
competitive voice that can be heard is an essential 21st Century literacy that 
needs to be developed in students. And we&rsquo;re doing that.</p> 
<p>But it&rsquo;s not all easy. Sometimes you have to say no, we can&rsquo;t 
do that. I had to learn that. As a classroom teacher, I could shut my door and 
deal with my kids. As an administrator, I have to have a much more global 
picture. I have to think deeply about my decisions and I have to evaluate their 
impact on many levels. I have to be adept at politically negotiating the two 
different climates atNorth and South, because the schools, even though they are 
about seven miles apart, are very different. One&rsquo;s bigger than the other, 
one has been around 75 years, the other 44 years. The departments are 
different, the two libraries are different. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing, it 
just is, and you have to be aware of how those differences impact what you do, 
what you can accomplish, what you need to accomplish, and how fast you can do 
it. Successful technology coordinators are leaders, and leaders understand that 
leadership is about relationships. Having relationships with people that 
understand you, and support you, are required to be truly successful, but this 
only comes with honoring and understanding them first.</p> 
<p>The bottom line? I&rsquo;m pretty fortunate. I have the opportunity on a 
daily basis to experience the entire range of responsibilities that an educator 
can have, from meeting with a school&rsquo;s administrative cabinet, to 
discussing a technology tool with a department chair, to writing our Illinois 
state technology plan, and then finally working 6th hour today with a group of 
Seniors at our North campus on how to dramatically improve their presentations 
with the inclusion of visuals from Flickr.</p> 
<p><em>And that&rsquo;s what I do.</em></p>

<h2>Reality Bytes</h2>  Posted by DSJ in Classrooms, Education <br>

<p>The school district I work for has two campuses-a North and a South Campus. 
North was the original high school in the district and dates back to 1928. If 
you do the math, it is 80 years old. A lot of kids have gone through that 
building, and so have many teachers and administrators. When you drive down 
Main Street, you see the school. Anyone will recognize it as a school, even 
though much has changed about the world we live in. It&rsquo;s been there a 
long time.</p> 
<p><em>And it&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</em></p> 
<p>When I retire in 13 years, it will still be there. Forty years from now, 
there will be a good chance that it still will be there, still opening its 
doors to kids. The physical spaces may change slightly, the rooms will be 
equipped perhaps differently, and hopefully what takes place in those rooms 
will change in some ways as well.</p> 
<p>But I&rsquo;m hoping that some things stay the same. There are still a lot 
of good things that happen in schools.</p> 
<p>The blogosphere is filled with posts about the need for school change and 
reform. I&rsquo;ve done them too, so I&rsquo;m guilty. And there is no doubt 
that schools have to improve-we all know that. We all know that there are bad 
schools; we know that there are bad teachers, bad administrators, and even bad 
students. Sometimes there is bad curriculum and bad instruction, with not much 
learning taking place. You get the picture.</p> 
<p>There is a continual undercurrent in the blogosphere that characterizes 
schools as places that are out of touch, as places that no longer connect, and 
that no longer serve a purpose. That&rsquo;s my general perception and not 
reflective of any single individual or post, just a feeling I get after several 
years of reading.</p> 
<p>I struggle with that characterization. I understand the blogosphere is a 
sounding board-throw an idea out there, see what sticks, and let people mash it 
up in &ldquo;conversation.&rdquo; But conversation is easy-and in this era of 
type and submit content creation-it&rsquo;s also convenient. In some cases, 
some of the conversation about schools gets heated, and can be downright 
caustic. Sometimes the discussion steps beyond the bounds of professional 
conversation-and unfortunately, seems to become personal. Sometimes I think all 
of this &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; disrespects the enormous amount of good work 
that teachers and schools do.</p> 
<p>Sometimes I think the conversation misses the target. Why? The conversation 
forgets:</p> 
<p><strong>1. That schools, like the one on Main Street in Downers Grove, and 
the schools that are in your community, can indeed be successful.</strong> 
There are numerous examples. It takes a shared collective vision, leadership, 
and educational professionals that are relentless in their pursuit of 
excellence. The kids will respond. You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to do it 
online, you don&rsquo;t have to do it in a multiplayer blog outside of a 
school, and you don&rsquo;t need some blogospheric magic bullet that creates 
some new type of school. That big building that looks like a school,<em>is a 
school</em>, can be a successful institution where much important learning 
takes place.</p> 
<p><strong>2. That school change, school reform, whatever you want to call it, 
can emerge from within schools themselves.</strong> Talk about school reform in 
the blogosphere all you want, legislate it all you want, but in my opinion, 
change will result by people in the system rolling up their sleeves and getting 
it done, and basing that reform on sound educational theory, meaningful 
information about students and student progress, dedicated professional 
educators, and again, all supported by that shared, collective vision. Leave 
the profession if you want, seek to educate kids in different ways if you want, 
but I&rsquo;m sticking around, because there are 5500 kids in my school 
district that need an education.<br>
<strong><br>
 3. That we know how to 
educate kids.</strong> Face it, is it really that difficult? Is a designing a 
quality lesson really that hard? Don&rsquo;t we know what&rsquo;s required 
already? Need a reminder? See Tom Hoffman&rsquo;s outline of hispresentation 
for Educon or this report about quality teaching, via Artichoke. We just 
don&rsquo;t do it all the time, see #1 above.</p> 
<p><strong>4. That students still need to be placed in rigorous, challenging 
learning environments where they learn things like writing, math, civics, and 
science.</strong> And you know what-perhaps it&rsquo;s also appropriate for 
kids to have an opportunity to sing, or create a painting, or maybe learn how 
to change a muffler, prepare a meal, and kick around a soccer ball. Perhaps 
that also needs to take place with adult guidance. And yes, on an individual 
basis, much of that can be done out of school. But how do you see that 
happening for the 5500 kids that I serve? I&rsquo;d like you to answer that. 
There is more to life, more to education, than blogs and wikis&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>5. That not all kids are tech-savvy</strong>, self-directed, 
highly-motivated independent learners that create dynamic and collaborative 
authentic content in multiple formats for distribution through social networks 
(full disclosure: every buzzword was used in the last sentence). But do you 
need someone to teach you how to text message? I&rsquo;ve got 5500 teachers for 
that. They&rsquo;ve got the interest, the capability, but they don&rsquo;t know 
everything. Utilize it, direct it, leverage it, but don&rsquo;t assume that all 
students know everything about technology, and how it can be used to drive 
their learning.</p> 
<p>The reality is that the conversation is important. It&rsquo;s challenging, 
it&rsquo;s fun, and it&rsquo;s frustrating, all at the same time. But sometimes 
the conversation forgets the reality of what needs to be accomplished, and what 
mainstream educators, educators who don&rsquo;t blog, but grade papers, call 
parents, coach freshman basketball, tutor kids during their lunch period, and 
serve on two committees, face every day.</p>
