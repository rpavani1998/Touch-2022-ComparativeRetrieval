<p>Changes at the Telegraph</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a long term subscriber, I won't see a difference as we pick it up out of 
our box. But I'll be thinking of the slow (quick?) changes in the way I receive 
information every day. Reading the paper, holding it in my hands involves more 
than just reading. The sensory input of my fingers, feeling the paper, the 
noisy crinkle as I flip to another page, the smell of fresh ink and newsprint, 
even the short time memory of my journey out to the street to retrieve my own 
copy all add up to a feeling of satisfaction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even after reading, the paper has more uses. I take individual sheets and 
cover the cat who wants to hide and play tiger in the forest. Since we have a 
wood stove, I save papers to start the fire when I've let it burn out to empty 
ashes. We use newspaper as mulch in the spring to jumpstart tender seedlings. 
We crinkle up newspapers as packing for tender items.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All these secondary uses come to us on newsprint as they have for hundreds 
of years. Digital media seems so bland and unattached to our normal lives. We 
scroll the pages on the screen and they disappear into the aether. like a ghost 
who has no real affect on our physical being, only a suggestion of meaning that 
once seen, remains to us as only a memory of visual content. A single and 
passive input to our senses. I like computers, I can hardly conceive of what my 
life would be like without the internet and email. Still, I subscribe to the 
Telegraph and magazines because paper is real. The Telegraph and all the people 
are real and substantial. When I pick up the paper, I know that there are lines 
of people behind it who worked and thought and collabrated and made my life 
happier.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ratcheting down of newspapers across the nation makes me uneasy. 
Talented reporters and staff are stressed. Stability and job security are a 
thing of the past. As a reader, I'm stressed because my news delivery service 
is being changed to something I don't enjoy nearly as much. I've had years of 
depending on daily updates from my favorite newspaper and that is threatened. 
Does reading the Huffington Post diminish the survival of my paper? Probably 
not, but I certainly don't want that or other internet news services to be my 
only remain choice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Telegraph is doing all it can to hold on. We loyal patrons who remain 
paid subscribers want it to continue forever, or at least until we make that 
final phase change ourselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coal power in U.S. - 'a dead man walking'?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Washington Post has a piece today (read it here) on the future of 
coal-fired electricity in the U.S. that examines it largely from a financial 
standpoint and concludes that as things currently stand, little or no new 
coal-fired power is likely to be built., That's partly because of the increased 
costs of environmental regulation of coal, which is the dirtiest of major fuels 
by most measurements, and partly because of the cost advantages of natural gas.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;When we do need new capacity, it is highly likely that we will look 
to natural gas plants instead of coal, especially if natural gas prices remain 
as low as projected,&quot; says (one energy executive). &quot;The plants are 
less expensive to build, and current forward price projections favor gas over 
coal.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We talk about coal a lot in New Hampshire, thanks to the 460-MW Merrimack 
Station plant in Bow, but the Granite Ridge natural gas plant in Londonderry 
(owned by energy giant AES) is actually bigger (750 MW). NH uses more natural 
gas than coal, overall (2005 figures showed natural gas at 16 percent of total 
energy use, coal was 10%,according to the state; nuclear was 22%) As the state 
Public Utilities Commission notes, natural gas is a big and growing player: 
&quot;Gas-fired electric generation in New England accounted for less than 1% 
of its electric supply in 1980; however, today it accounts for over 41% and is 
expected to increase to 49% by 2010.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boston sends water through turbines en route from reservoir</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This seems like an obvious idea, but one in which the finances might be 
tough to justify up front: The Massachusetts Water Reserve Authority has 
installed turbines in some pipes that feed water by gravity from the Quabbin 
Reservoir, getting 1.2 million kilowatt-hours* a year from the system (110 
homes worth of power, by Mass. calculations). It's basically a small hydropower 
plant in a man-made rapids.&nbsp; Globe story is here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If it works as planned they'll save $150,000 a year, which means a roughly 
15-year payback on the $1.8 million system.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* OK, so I originally left out the &quot;million&quot; ... </p>

<p>MIT is turning 150, and its museum will shine</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The MIT Museum has been refurbished and will reopen this weekend, part of a 
bunch of celebrations about the school turning 150. Among the items that will 
be on display: the world's first pocket-sized scientific calculator (1972); 
wind tunnel models that helped determine the cause of the John Hancock Tower's 
window failure (1970s); MIT-Harvard merger petitions (1904); recordings from an 
(impromptu) Grateful Dead concert at MIT (1970).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the press information; the museum show will be on display all year.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm not sure if they'll have any of their most famous display, of various 
MIT hacks - including the fake cop car that was placed on top of the MIT Dome. 
I covered that show years ago.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Spontaneous combustion - the real kind (unfortunately)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The term &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; in news reports usually refers 
to the unsubstantiated idea that people sometimes burst into flame and burn up 
for no obvious reason.Here's a SCICOP article about this myth.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Concord Monitor has a story today about real spontaneous combustion, 
however: A pile of oily rags burst into flame and burned down a restaurant. (
Read the story here.) Along with grain/wood dust exploding, a topic I discussed 
a couple of weeks ago, that's the main cause of flame appearing out of nowhere. 
This explainer is from a Cornell Material Science site (here):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>People working around the house often get rags full of stuff like paint 
thinner, varnish, or cleaner for car engine parts on them. This stuff burns 
like crazy. When a rag is soaked with oily materials, the liquids evaporate and 
fill spaces like basements and trash cans with fumes: fumes that can burn. 
Fires start when the fumes get hot. The sun might beat down. Or, a downstairs 
refrigerator might come on, and the electric motor inside might make just 
enough of a spark to start the whole place burning.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can see it really isn't completely spontaneous, since some external 
energy is required. But not very much.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Oily rags should be stored in a sealed container or in water, in 
well-ventilated spots, or laid out flat (not bunched up) to dry.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>$10 million of 'torture, harassment and bodily harm' from cell towers</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This item ran on The Lobby, a business/politics news site run by the 
Telegraph,&nbsp; and I probably shouldn't reprint it because we charge 
subscribers money to see that service - but doggone it, I can't resist:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bruce Loudenslager, a Goffstown resident, is suing Clear Channel radio 
stations, WMUR-TV and Citadel Broadcasting for &quot;torture, harassment and 
bodily harm from the continuous use of radio frequency and/or microwave 
targeting.&quot; After reading up on the matter, Loudenslager concluded that 
&quot;these devices are capable of serious bodily harm, death, and can be 
classed as a deadly weapon.&quot; Loudenslager is asking for $10 million in 
damages. Included in the filing a printout from www.us-government-torture.com, 
offering links to methods to &quot;neutralize the electronic attacks carried 
out with exotic delivery methods using transmitters for large population areas, 
implantable microchips and directed energy.&quot; The effects of the 
&quot;super-secret&quot; government program &quot;to eliminate opposition&quot; 
are to &quot;reduce the brain's essential chemistry gradually without the 
target being aware.&quot; And you thought only campaign ads did that.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Discovery Center: 'Astro-photography 101&acirc;&#128;&sup2;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Taking pictures of the night sky is harder than it sounds, and few of us 
will ever be able to take photos like a mind-boggling shot of the ISS in front 
of the sun during a solar eclipse (check it here). But there is help at hand at 
the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center on Friday, during its weekly Super 
Stellar Friday event. New Hampshire Astronomical Society astrophotographer 
Gardner Gerry will show what equipment to use and how to use it. Participants 
can bring their camera and test&nbsp; the tips. There will also be a free 
Skywatch program outside with telescope advice and help.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The program starts at 7 p.m. As always, it's recommended for ages above age 
8, and those under 13 must be accompanied by an adult. Cost is $9 adults, $8 
seniors &amp; students, $6 children.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Details are here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even a coal-fired-power-plant-powered electric car is good</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nothing local this morning, so I'll link to this story, which discusses a 
Swiss life-cycle analysis of electric and gas-powered cars. The conclusion: 
From soup to nuts, including the impact of making those big batteries, even an 
electric car that gets its juice from a nasty coal-fired plant is equivalent to 
a conventional car that gets 45 mpg. If it gets power solely from windmills or 
solar panels (not that any do, of course) the equivalent is 117 mpg. Not bad.

<p>GPS-enabled coyotes control rats and mice in Chicago</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Via Braniac, I learned that Chicago puts GPS units on wild coyotes that now 
live in the city, to study their habits. One finding: They're pretty good at 
controlling rats and other vermin.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the Braniac piece. A quote:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's looking as though residents will end up adapting, too. They have no 
choice: It's impossible, in the end, to run the coyotes out of town. Although 
troublesome individuals can be relocated or put down, wholesale removal of a 
whole group just opens up the territory for new coyotes. Anyway, the coyotes 
usually keep out of sight. The project has revealed that they're more 
comfortable with urban life than one would have thought.</p>

<p>We're practically a snow desert this year</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My daughter and I went skiing today, up at Loon in the White Mountains. 
Boy, is that a gigantic place; I swear some of the runs are wider than runs at 
Pat's Peak are tall. But also boy, is the North Country hurting for snow - Loon 
has been making snow like crazy but none of the tree-skiing runs are open 
because there's so little natural snow, and a couple of its steeper runs were 
closed so that (presumably, anyway) relatively sparse weekday crowds wouldn't 
hurt them for the weekend throngs. The recent habit of big storms traveling 
south of NH is getting to be annoying.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Weirdly, I somehow smashed my left big toe, which is blue, swollen and 
throbbing. How do you hurt a toe when it's encased inside a tough, sold ski 
boot, I wonder? I never hit it or ran into anything ...</p>

<p>Predator insect shows signs of success against wooly adelgid</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Associated Press has a story (here's the version in the Portland paper) 
saying that tests of a beetle called Laricobius nigrinus show it to be 
relatively successful in reducing wooly adelgid populations in New England, 
perhaps protecting out hemlock population. Not much detail in the story, but it 
sounds optimistic.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S.: Many of us get too much fluoride</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have long been critical of people who oppose fluoridation of public water 
supplies, but it seems I am at least partly wrong. In a surprising turnaround, 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is agreeing with one of the 
critics' main points, and is calling for a reduction in some fluoridation 
levels &quot;because of its presence not just in drinking water but in 
toothpaste, mouthwash and other products, causing splotches on children's teeth 
and perhaps more serious problems.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Read an AP story here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Note that the US isn't saying we should stop adding fluoride to drinking 
water supplies, only that we should add less of it. Still, that's an amazing 
change, and is sure to fire up the whole debate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here are NH communities that fluoridate. (Note that the vast majority of 
the states 240-some-odd communities don't have a public water supply, and so 
can't add it. The biggest place with public water that's noton this list is 
Nashua):</p>

<p>Creating a Wikipedia article to celebrate the 10th anniversary</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This is what it looked like 12 hours after being created as a single 
sentence.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This coming Friday is Wikipedia's 10th anniversary. To mark it, I have an 
article in the Telegraph today (read it here, accompanied by a video that is 
currently screwed up, so that the voice-over doesn't match the screen grabs ...
) explaining the process.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article is about Greeley Park, Nashua: This is it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>January 10, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UNH helps sequence strawberry genome</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From UNH News Service: An international team of researchers, including 
several from the University of New Hampshire, have completed the first DNA 
sequence of any strawberry plant, giving breeders much-needed tools to create 
tastier, healthier strawberries. Tom Davis, professor of biological sciences at 
UNH, and postdoctoral researcher Bo Liu were significant contributors to the 
genome sequence of the woodland strawberry, which was published last month in 
the journal Nature Genetics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We now have a resource for everybody who's interested in strawberry 
genetics. We can answer questions that before would have been impossible to 
address,&quot; says Davis, who has been working on the strawberry genome 
project since 2006 as part of the international Strawberry Genome Sequencing 
Consortium.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For instance, says Davis, breeders can now look at the DNA 
&quot;fingerprint&quot; of strawberry plants to more easily breed those with 
enhanced flavor, aroma, or antioxidant properties. Or they could breed more 
disease-resistant berries, decreasing the significant amount of spraying that 
cultivated strawberries currently need to thrive and thus enhancing the berry's 
healthful qualities.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Further, the woodland strawberry is a member of the Rosaceae family, which 
includes apples, peaches, cherries, raspberries, and almonds, all economically 
important and popular crops; researchers say the DNA sequence of the strawberry 
genome will inform the breeding of these other fruits. &quot;We can now begin 
to understand how evolution works at the level of the genome on this family of 
plants we all enjoy,&quot; says Davis.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The genome sequencing effort, led by researchers at the University of 
Florida and Virginia Tech, found that the woodland strawberry 
&acirc;&#128;&#148;<em>Fragaria vesca &acirc;&#128;&#147; </em>has240 million 
base pairs of DNA (compared to 3 billion for humans), making it one of the 
smallest genomes of economically significant plants. The consortium focused 
first on sequencing the wild woodland strawberry because its cultivated 
cousins, all hybrids, are far more complex.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Building upon prior publications in which he described a one percent 
genomic sampling of a native New Hampshire wild strawberry, Davis played 
multiple roles in genome project planning, data interpretation, and manuscript 
preparation. Liu's unique contribution to this effort was to independently 
document the locations of specific sequences called ribosomal gene clusters on 
the chromosomes themselves, using an advanced microscopic technique known as 
fluorescent in situ hybridization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Nature Genetics paper, &quot;The genome of the woodland 
strawberry,&quot; is available here:
http://strawberrygenes.unh.edu/Published.740%5B1%5D.pdf. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By coincidence, the complete genomic sequence of another delectable plant 
species,<em>Theobroma cacao</em> (chocolate), was published in the same journal 
issue. More information on strawberry genome work at UNH is at
strawberrygenes.unh.edu. The UNH component of this work was supported, in part, 
by the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station and by a grant from the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (National Research Initiative) Plant Genome 
program.</p>

<p>Bobcats are returning to the area - for better and worse</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today is about research designed to determine the 
extent of bobcats' return to New Hampshire, via GPS radio collars and public 
observation.Read it here - and start looking for bobcat tracks in the snow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Not everybody is thrilled by this study, as I note: Some fear it's a 
backhanded way to return a hunting/trapping season on bobcats, which ended in 
1988.</p>

<p>49 of 50 states have snow on the ground</p>

<p>Hawaii has snow on Mauna Kea - so only Florida is lacking snow on the 
ground at the moment,says NOAA.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scroll down on that NOAA page: It notes that Arctic sea ice is way below 
normal. Weather is a weird thing, eh?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>N.H. lawmakers think about killing cap-and-trade</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire's Republican-dominated legislature - &quot;dominated&quot; is 
hardly strong enough; the GOP is king and queen of all it surveys in Concord 
after it swept the state in the last election - is taking a look at whether to 
continue our participation in the regional carbon cap-and-trade program called 
RGGI, or Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. New Hampshire Public Radio has a 
report (you can read the transcript here).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>RGGI basically makes electricity producers pay for the right to emit 
pollution and uses the money to pay for energy efficiency work. It's a 10-state 
program that was long touted as a model for national cap-and-trade - something 
that isn't going to happen any time soon. That federal fizzle, combined with 
the way RGGI prices have collapsed because the recession reducing the 
short-term need for carbon offsets, has taken some of the wind out of its 
sails. A few states have already begun raiding RGGI money to offset budget 
problems.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>California, meanwhile, is talking about a cap-and-trade program of its own, 
which because of the size of that state's economy would have even more oomph 
than RGGI at its peak.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Verizon iPhone is a great move, or a lousy one</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Verizon Wireless is expected to announce today or possibly later this week 
will start handling iPhones in February. This demonstrates how brilliant 
Verizon is because they waited for AT&amp;T to show the drawbacks,says Slate, 
or how not-so-brilliant Verizon is because AT&amp;T has alot of the business 
tied up already,says AP, or how savvy/desperate Verizon is because it may offer 
unlimited downloads to lure new customers,says the Wall Street Journal.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And that's enough about that ...</p>

<p>I'm disappointed by our &quot;create-a-Wikipedia-article&quot; attempt</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm a little disappointed by my call to Nashua readers to create a 
Wikipedia article in honor of the site's 10th anniversary. It's about Greeley 
Park in the city, and it's still pretty stubby,as you can see here, showing it 
at 7 a.m. on Tuesday. I'll have to shake the readership tree a bit, see if I 
can get more action</p>

<p>Millisecond power pulses make for a super de-icer</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Dartmouth engineering professor has developed a de-icing system called 
pulse electro-thermal de-icing that sounds great:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PETD uses a thin, electrically-conductive film applied to the surface of, 
for example, an airplane or a windshield or almost any other object in need of 
ice protection. The film is then heated with a milliseconds-long pulse of 
electricity. The beauty of this method is that only a micrometer-thin layer of 
ice directly at the ice-material interface is heated without having to heat the 
bulk of the object to which the ice is stuck. Even in extreme cold, PETD 
achieves nearly perfect efficiency because neither the object nor the air is 
heated&acirc;&#128;&#148;the heat simply does not have time to propagate into 
the environment. Just one single pulse of electricity melts the interfacial ice 
and instantly releases any additional build-up, which then easily slides off. 
Regular electric pulsing can keep surfaces consistently ice-free while 
maintaining low overall power consumption.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the site with lots more details.&nbsp; Check out the video showing 
it de-icing a windshield. I want one!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To raise or not to raise - windshield wipers when you're parked, that is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A couple of winters ago I posted about whether it was a good idea to raise 
your windshield wipers when you parked your car during a snowstorm (as shown in 
the file photo here). It garnered a surprising amount of debate, with some 
folks saying only wimpy losers did it, others saying only ignorant flatlanders 
didn't do it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I just left my car in the Telegraph lot with the wipers raised, although 
with this fluffy snow it may not matter much. It's when you have icy rain that

&quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; who swiped bandwidth from Seacoast

<p>Cellulosic biofuel company Mascoma gets a big buy-in</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire's best bet in the long race to develop biofuel from plant 
cellulose rather than from plant sugars (e.g., from wood chips instead of corn 
kernels) is Mascoma Corp., created by a couple of Dartmouth professors, one of 
whom (Lee Lynd) went to college with me.&nbsp; Mascoma got a lot of attention a 
couple of years ago but has been bypassed by bigger, higher-profile efforts 
recently. Company news released today may change that. From the company press 
release:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mascoma and Valero Ink Deal to Develop Commercial Cellulosic Ethanol 
Biorefinery</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Lebanon, NH &acirc;&#128;&#147;&nbsp;January&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2011
</strong>: Mascoma Corporation today announced&nbsp;that Valero Energy 
Corporation, the nation's largest independent oil refiner,&nbsp;has invested in 
Mascoma Corporation.&nbsp; Further, Mascoma, Valero, and Mascoma's operating 
subsidiary,Frontier Renewable Resources LLC, jointly owned with natural 
resource management company, J.M. Longyear LLC, have signed a non-binding 
letter of intent to support the construction of one of the world's first 
commercial scale wood-based cellulosic ethanol biorefineries, slated to break 
ground in 2011 in Kinross Charter Township, Michigan.&nbsp; Under the terms of 
the letter of intent, Valero would potentially invest up to $50 million of the 
equity required to finance the project through Frontier Kinross LLC, a 
subsidiary of Frontier, and would enter into an&nbsp;off-take agreement for the 
project's ethanol production.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Valero's participation in the project strengthens the financing package for 
the Kinross biorefinery, complemented with&nbsp;funds&nbsp;from the State of 
Michigan, through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and the 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).&nbsp; As further support of the project, 
Valero would provide project development and construction oversight services. 
&nbsp;The biorefinery is planned to have an annual production of 40 million 
gallons of low-carbon cellulosic ethanol, to be covered by the off-take 
arrangement with Valero.&nbsp; Frontier will use hardwood pulpwood, which is 
selectively harvested, naturally regenerated, and is an underutilized, abundant 
resource in the area surrounding the Kinross biorefinery.&nbsp; Mascoma's 
200,000 gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year&nbsp;demonstration facility in 
Rome, New York, has demonstrated the viability of the technology over the past 
two years and sets the stage for the commercial facility.</p>

<p>Our snow was was pretty fluffy: 8-1 water/snow ratio</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At my house, 16.5 inches of snow fell in yesterday's storm, the first 
decent one of the winter. I melted it down as part of myCoCoRaHS 
precipitation-watching duties, and got 2.05 inches of water. Roughly 8-1 ratio, 
which is pretty average for snow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I learned from prevous problems to work harder at melting the snow - I put 
it in the still-warm oven right after dinner. It still good a good hour to 
melt, though.</p>

<p>Have the signs of the Zodiac changed? Of course, and not really</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You may have stumbled across some discussion/news lately saying that 
&quot;scientists&quot; have realized that the signs of the Zodiac are 
&quot;wrong&quot; - discussions likethis one at Salon, which starts out 
&quot;Yesterday I was a Leo. Today I'm a Cancer&quot; and gets all huffy that 
mean astronomers have ruined his day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What happened, it turns out, is that a reporter talked to an astronomer and 
learned about the precession of the equinoxes - the fact that Earth wobbles in 
its orbit so that the imaginary figures drawn in the sky called &quot;Zodiac 
signs&quot; have shifted over the millennia. The sun doesn't pass through the 
Western Zodiac signs (other cultures draw different pictures in the sky, which 
tells you something about astrology right there) during the times of year that 
astrologers pretend it does, and hasn't for a long time. Making an 
&quot;accurate&quot; zodiac not only changes the time of year for the signs but 
adds one, called Ophiuchus, that was ignored because it ruined the numerical 
pattern.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The reporter wrote up this non-news, the item was carried along on the 
Internet's wave foam, encountered by people who didn't realize this information 
and/or misunderstood it, and nonsense ensued.&nbsp; It's kind of entertaining, 
in an exasperating way, to watch&nbsp; humanity waste mental effort on 
something so incredibly stupid.Here is a discussion from Phil Plait of Bad 
Astronomy fame.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

actually a groundhog.</p>

<p>A FIRST robotics parody of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; - tonight in Amherst</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More importantly, though, is that they'll be preceded by a short skit put 
on by the team, involving a sort-of-but-not-really musical parody of 
&quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. Here's a snippet of lyrics - a program team member to

<p>Does it rain more in NH or in neighboring states?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The national network of precipitation-watching volunteers called CoCoRaHS 
has compiled state-by-state data from its various volunteer observing stations 
in 2010.The chart is here, if you want to ponder it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The part I liked best was the number of days per year that it rained, 
snowed or sleeted. Each state gets a minimum maximum number, taken from the 
various stations. Basically, we get precipitation one day out of every three. 
Here are the results for New Hampshire and its neighboring states:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>State / min. - max. days with precipitation in 2010</b> </p> 
<p>* NH / 118 - 146 days<br>
 * Vt. / 166 - 211 days<br>
 * Mass. / 122 - 139 
days<br>
 * Maine / 110 - 133 days </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Overall, it's pretty constant except for Vermont, which comes across as 
notably grayer and damper than its neighbors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Note that this data is taken from fewer than 10 stations in each state, 
since that's the number which reported a &quot;complete water year,&quot; not 
missing any days. Each state has dozens of stations (including me, although I 
only started in December) but most of us miss the occasional day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The range can be much greater in other states: Hawaii, which includes what 
may bethe wettest place on Earth, ranges from 37 days of precipitation to 267 
of them! Washington state, which has Seattle as well as near-deserts, goes from 
44 to 224. The smallest variation I could find was Delaware, which reported 
between 111 and 125 days of precipitation</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As the magnetic pole moves, should airport runways be renamed?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today asks why no New Hampshire airport runways have 
had to be renamed in recent memory, even though the magnetic North Pole has 
moved enough that a runway in Tampa, Fla. had to change its numbers (which 
indicate the magnetic direction that runways point).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the column, entertaining and brilliantly written as always.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the short answer, for the impatient: The pole hasn't moved enough, 
and nobody that I could contact knows why Tampa had to change when no other 
airport did.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change made the sun rise earlier! (Not)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Human behavior is changing the climate and causing lots of astonishing 
stuff to happen, yes - but sometimes folks go overboard. For example, there's a 
report that climate change made the sun rise two days earlier than expected 
after the winter dark period in Greenland.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wow ... CO2 buildup can change the spin of the Earth!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Well, no - obviously. The most likely explanation (as discussed here) is 
that an unusual ice crystal called pyramidilly-terminated hexagonal prism in 
the atmospher caused a larger-than-usual halo effect around the sun, which made 
a just-below-the-horizon sun to be apparently visible. Pretty prosaic, alas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>lthough, come to think of it, maybe excess greenhouse gas changes the 
likelihood of pyramidilly-terminated hexagonal prism crystals ... in which 
case, climate change<em>would </em>be the cause! Did I scoff too soon?</p>

<p>Multi-megawatt solar plants keep coming to Mass.</p> 
<p>One of the interesting things of maintaining my alternative-power Google 
Map has been watching the size and number of solar and wind projects grow over 
time, which means I have slowly been dropping smaller projects that I had added 
due to lack of alternatives (e.g., the one wind turbine at Jiminy Peak Ski 
Area; the Brockton Brightfield solar plant in Mass.).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For a long time the region had no solar-power project bigger than about 500 
kilowatts, but now the megawatt-level projects are starting to arrive in 
Massachusetts. The latest plan calls for a 4.2-megawatt plant near Springfield, 
which would be more than twice the size of New England's biggest PV site.Read 
the Mass High Tech story here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>t the moment, the North Conway Water Project PV plant (167 kilowatts) is 
the biggest in N.H. I haven't heard much later about PSNH's idea for a 
multi-megawatt plant at the Manchester landfill, which was tied up in questions 
of whether the utility could use some money it pays into a state-controlled 
renewable energy fund.</p>

and give them enough tools to 'bend' circuits, take things apart and build new

of&nbsp;opportunities for cheap robots and little machines.</p>

<p>January 19, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A new invasive fish in NH 'likely introduced by human intervention</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A press release from the state:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The state departments of Environmental Services (DES) and Fish and<strong> 
</strong>Game announced today the discovery of the rosyside dace (Clinostomus 
funduloides), a non-native member of the minnow family previously unknown in 
New Hampshire. The species was found inhabiting Hewes Brook, a tributary of the 
Connecticut River in Lyme. The discovery was made in summer 2010 by DES 
biologists during routine biological monitoring activities. The species' 
identity was recently confirmed by three independent researchers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;While the origin of this species in New Hampshire is uncertain, it 
seems likely to have been introduced by human intervention,&quot; said David 
Neils, DES biologist.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the time of sampling, 85 individuals were captured. However, based on 
observations, DES biologists estimated the population to be in the hundreds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The introduction of aquatic non-native species to New Hampshire 
waters presents a serious danger to the ecological integrity of our waterways, 
as well as our ability to enjoy them,&quot; stated Thomas Burack, DES 
Commissioner. New Hampshire laws and administrative rules prohibit the 
introduction of non-native species. Specifically with regard to fish and 
wildlife, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department Administrative Rules 
control the possession and importation, and prohibit the release of, 
non-indigenous or non-naturalized fish species to New Hampshire waters. The 
same rules also prohibit the possession of live fish, other than approved 
baitfish species when leaving any freshwaters of the state.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Anglers are unlikely to catch the rosyside dace using hook-and-line 
because of its small size, but incidental capture is possible by means of 
baitfish trapping,&quot; said Jason Smith, Fish and Game biologist.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Smith recommends that if fish caught are suspected to be the rosyside dace 
or any other non-native aquatic species previously undocumented in New 
Hampshire, individuals should immediately release them back into the waters 
from which they were captured, and contact either the Fish and Game Inland 
Fisheries Division (603-271-2501) or the DES biology section (603-271-8865).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;There is no indication at this point that the rosyside dace could 
cause recreational or economic problems; however, ecological impacts to the 
native fish community are possible depending on the ability of the species to 
expand its range and successfully propagate,&quot; said Glenn Normandeau, Fish 
and Game Executive Director.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The rosyside dace is a member of the minnow family (Cyprinidae) and 
typically inhabits small streams with adults ranging from two to four inches in 
length. Its native distribution is recognized as extending from the Delaware 
River drainage in Pennsylvania to the Savannah River drainage in Georgia, as 
well as portions of the Ohio River basin. It is not known to occur in the 
Connecticut River or its tributaries, other than Hewes Brook, at this time.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

271-8865 or david.neils@des.nh.gov .</p>

<p>Today's ice-on-streets factoid: Roadsalt bounces, brine doesn't</p> 
<p>Last night's icy rain on top of snow didn't produce the morning commute 
nightmare I was expecting - although I almost fell three times walking to the 
car in my own driveway. But this is still the time of year when how to handle 
ice on roads is big on our winds.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In wandering through news websites I found a story from the Burlington 
Free-Press discussing Vermont practices. (Read it here) It included two 
interesting tidbits:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* The effectiveness of road salt goes down dramatically as the temperature 
goes down. At 30 degrees, for example, a pound of salt would melt 46.3 pounds 
of ice, while at 10 degrees that same pound would melt just 4.9 pounds of ice.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And this item, concerning the growing practicing of using salt brine on 
icy/snow roads:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* In the past two years, the state has begun experimenting with brine in 
northwestern Vermont. ... Dry rock salt bounces when it hits the road surface, 
and a significant amount can end up outside travel lanes. The agency is still 
evaluating the benefits of brine versus its cost, Rogers said, but 
acknowledged, &quot;I'm a big believer in it.&quot; He said he expected to 
bring brine to central Vermont next year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lost under the snow: a snow-measuring snowboard</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Part of measuring precipitation for the volunteer CoCoRaHS program involves 
putting out a &quot;snowboard&quot; - a white, flat board. You put it on top of 
each new snowfall, so that you can measure the amount of the next snowfall. (
This CoCoRaHS pageexplains the process and shows one, which can be just a piece 
of painted plywood.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the training class, they warn you to mark its location, which has to be 
out in the open away from any obvious markers like trees that might affect 
snowfall in the spot. I knew where my was, though ... or so I thought.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I just spent 10 minutes busting through the crusted-over 16&quot; of snow 
(yesterdays' storm ended with icy rain, ugh) trying to find the friggin' thing 
and had to give up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the drawback of using volunteer labor; we can be kind of stupid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>January 20, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>2010 was New Hampshire's warmest year on record</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last year was the warmest in New Hamnpshire since records began to be kept 
in 1895, according to Mary Stampone, UNH professor and state climatologist.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 2010 mean temperature was 46.7 degrees Fahrenheit, nearly 3 degrees 
above the average from 1971 to 2000, which is considered the base temperature 
for modern comparisons, and 3.3 degrees warmer than the average from 1895 to 
2010. Precipitation was also above normal for 2010, with an annual total of 
47.45 inches, making it the 24th wettest in the last 115 years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Stampone said 2010's warmth came early in the year, with very high 
temperatures for January, February, March and April followed by mostly normal 
temperatures for May through December. Since 1895, three of New Hampshire's top 
10 warmest years occurred during the last decade, and seven of the 10 warmest 
have occurred since 1990.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> century of humans putting heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere is, I'm 
sure, unrelated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How much credence must be given to silly fears?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you were absolutely convinced that road asphalt was causing your heart 
to defribrillate, would the local road agent have to rip up the street in front 
of your house and replace it with, say, crushed walnuts? No, of course not. 
People's concerns must have some basis in fact to force public action.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Should plans to install somewhat interactive electric meters, as a step 
toward making more efficient use of our electricity, be stymied by the fact 
that a few people are convinced the wireless meters do weird stuff to their 
bodies? No, of course not. As I said, people's concerns must have some basis in 
fact to force public action.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's what Central Maine Power Co. says, in this Press-Herald article, and 
I can't blame them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Whether &quot;smart meters&quot; will lead to hard-to-spot rate hikes is 
another matter, of course - one that isn't crazy to worry about.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More on those hydropower power lines</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The fight is ramping up over a proposal to construct a 1,200-MW high 
voltage DC power line to bring more hydropower down from Quebec through NH to 
points south. The Monitor has an article today that takes a local aspect: That 
towers may require FAA approval because they might go near the city's airport, 
unless existing rights of way can be used. (Read it here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PSNH and HydroQuebec cals the project the Northern Pass, and the big 
problem is that it would require cutting scores of miles of new rights of way, 
usually through wooded areas and over ridgelines. There's plenty of opposition 
up north, where the bulk of the new routes would be placed - e.g., here's a 
blog calledBury the Northern Pass.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here is PSNH's take on it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>January 22, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How much snow is on the ground? Depends where I measure</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I measured snow depth this morning with my wicked cool tenths-of-an-inch 
CoCoRaHS ruler in two locations about 50 yards apart, separated by my house. 
The snowfall looks the same in both locations - but in one place it says 24 or 
25 inches, differing slightly by location, and the other says 18 or 19 inches. 
That's a 25 percent difference (or 33 percent, if you prefer).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I chose the lower one to report, but it seems pretty arbitrary. I no longer 
take those snow depth totals that I see on the TV weather reports very 
seriously.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The complicated machinery behind 'single-stream' recycling</p> 
<p>Cnet's Green Tech blog visited a huge single-stream recycling facility in 
Massachusetts, and talks about the cool machinery that separates paper from 
plastic from various metals - including &quot;eddy current&quot; magnetic 
fields that can be used to separate aluminum cans, even though aluminum is not 
affected by magnetism. Read it here. It's got some impressive pictures; this is 
a huge operation that handles 16,000 tons of stuff each month.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I wrote about the eddy current effect from the same facility back in May 
2009, but the friggin' item isn't linkable: I can only find it via a search 
query that can't be linked. So I'll cut-and-paste a portion of that column:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eddy currents in electromagnetism are analogous to eddy currents in the 
ocean, which can swirl opposite to the general flow of water - such as when the 
outgoing tide moves around a pier or you pull an oar through the water.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If a moving magnetic field passes through a material that conducts 
electricity (like aluminum, which is a great conductor), it sets up a current 
among the atoms of that material. This current, naturally, establishes a 
magnetic field of its own - remember, all electric currents generate magnetic 
fields and vice versa.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new magnetic field opposes the original magnetic field, just as eddy 
currents in water run opposite to the original current. The result? These two 
magnetic fields repel each other, the way the north end of one magnet repels 
the north end of another magnet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Casella's system, the moving magnetic field is established by a big 
drum, roughly 2-1/2 feet wide, that is filled with bulky permanent magnets. 
&quot;I'm not sure how heavy the drum is, but two guys can't pick it up,&quot; 
said White.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The drum spins at an impressive 3,000 rpm, generating a magnetic field of 
such strength that it instantly creates an opposing field in even the most 
crumpled of Moxie cans, sending them flying off the adjacent conveyor belt into 
sorting bins.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eddy currents are new to me but they have long been used in a bunch of 
different technologies. These range from car shredders (which used magnetic 
drums that can be 8 feet wide and must weigh umpty-bazillion pounds) to 
coin-operated machines. The latter use eddy currents to separate 
&quot;slugs&quot; from real coins, because different conductivity levels cause 
the rolling objects to be slowed by different amounts.</p>

<p>Fluoride in drinking water: Good stuff, at lower levels</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today is about the desirability of fluoridating public 
drinking water, albeit at lower levels, per the recommendation of the US 
government.You can read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So far it has five anti-fluoride comments, but they're all pretty 
reasonable and rant-free (although one does use the word 
&quot;fluoridationists,&quot; which is a new one to me). They all take the 
point of view that only ignorance or cupidity would lead somebody to disagree 
with their strongly held belief - but that's a point of view taken by most of 
humanity regarding most topics, so it can't be held against them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've only gotten one FLUORIDE IS POISON!!!! email, with the caps key 
locked. So far, that is.</p>

<p>10 below is good invasive-bug-killing weather</p> 
<p>Jan. 24 6:50 a.m. report</p> 
<p>It's either 10 below or 12 below at my house this morning, depending on 
which thermometer you believe. Startling weather for humans, but a couple days 
of this would be a great way to contain the spread of some invasive tree-boring 
insects that are taking advantage of our slowly warming weather.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ll of New England is being hit by Canadian Arctic weather. Check Mount 
Washington's 7 a.m. weather report, above!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Because we haven't had temperatures this low ina couple of winters (I don't 
think we got below zero last year at all), I am reminded of a rule I had 
forgotten: At roughly 10 above, nose hairs freeze when you inhale. At 10 below, 
they don't completely thaw when you exhale. It's one of those rules of thumb 
which sounds much better than :&quot;rules of nose hair.&quot;</p> 
<p>lso, I am reminded of the great scrunchy noise that snow makes when you 
walk on it and it's this cold. I've always liked that noise, for whatever 
reason.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finally, check this NY Times article talking about freakishly warm weather 
in the Arctic and freakishly cold/snowy weather in the US and Europe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The deeper issue is whether this pattern is linked to the rapid changes 
that global warming is causing in the Arctic, particularly the drastic loss of 
sea ice. At least two prominent climate scientists have offered theories 
suggesting that it is. But many others are doubtful, saying the recent events 
are unexceptional, or that more evidence over a longer period would be needed 
to establish a link.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since satellites began tracking it in 1979, the ice on the Arctic Ocean's 
surface in the bellwether month of September has declined by more than 30 
percent. It is the most striking change in the terrain of the planet in recent 
decades, and a major question is whether it is starting to have an effect on 
broad weather patterns. Ice reflects sunlight, and scientists say the loss of 
ice is causing the Arctic Ocean to absorb more heat in the summer. A handful of 
scientists point to that extra heat as a possible culprit in the recent harsh 
winters in Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>Hackers from Tunisia take down Maine newspaper site</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Bangor Daily News has an unusual statement on its home page today:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Bangor Daily News website suffered several hours of downtime Monday 
evening after hackers from Tunisia exploited a security vulnerability on one of 
the BDN's servers. While the site is being restored, online readers will notice 
changes to the display of the site and will be unable to access some features 
and archived articles. The BDN staff is working as quickly as possible to fully 
restore the site.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It doesn't explain why Tunisians would target northern Maine; I assume it 
was a random attempt to snag customer information or something similarly 
unconnected to Tunisia's turmoil.You can see the paper here.</p>

<p>N.H. kids' steering wheel sensors detect distracted driving</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some home-schooled teens in Londonderry have gotten federal attention from 
an invention that would put sensors on steering wheels to detect when drivers 
have removed their hands for too long - a sign that they may be texting, 
combing their mustache, eating burritos, or otherwise distracted from save 
driving.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's an NY Times piece about their meeting with the U.S. Secretary of 
Transportation.They also met with Aneesh Chopra, the federal Chief Technology 
Officer. Here's their blog; they call themselves the Inventioneers.</p>

<p>Can tires spinning on ice really make a car burst into flame?</p> 
<p> car in Rochester was stuck on the ice and the driver gunned it so hard and 
so long, trying to get off the ice, making the tires spin so fast they caused 
the car to catch fire. At least, that's what the a fire marhsal told Foster's 
Daily Democratin this story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It stuck me as a little odd, since presumably the tires were on ice which 
wouldn't easily build up enough friction to burn rubber. It turns out that our 
good friends at Mythbusters have examined thi myth (although on the ground, not 
on ice). The video isn't online, butthis summary says they busted it - that is, 
they couldn't start a fire from pure friction, not even when dribbling gasoline 
on the hot, spinning tire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So chances are that the Rochester fire was caused by some sort of flammable 
liquid on the ground near the the very hot spinning tires, or something along 
those lines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, the care definitely burst into flame and it was definitely sparked 
(so to speak) by the mindlessly aggressive attempts to get off the ice, so 
regardless of physics nitpicking, the fire marshal was right in the overall 
sense.</p>

<p>25 years of computer viruses</p>

<p>(Just finished measuring 4.5 inches of snow - 0.42 inches of melted water, 
so this is pretty fluffy light stuff. I've got around 20&quot; on the ground 
now. And there's nothing local in tech news, so ...)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Stuxnet virus, often considered the first computer virus to flourish in 
the wild, was released 25 years ago this month, as I realized after readingthis 
NY Times opinion piece - which notes that it was a mistake:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(They wrote it) to safeguard the latest version of their heart-monitoring 
software from piracy. They called it Brain, and it was basically a wheel-clamp 
for PCs. Computers that ran their program, plus this new bit of code, would 
stop working after a year, though they cheerfully provided three telephone 
numbers, against the day. If you were a legitimate user, and could prove it, 
they'd unlock you.</p>

<p>25th anniversary of the Challenger explosion</p> 
<p>The Challenger explosion is one of those events in which everybody 
remembers where they were when they heard about it. I walked into the house and 
saw Ronald Reagan on TV in the middle of the afternoon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are lots of memorial pieces today. The Telegraph's article includes a 
PDF of McAuliffe's original application to the Teacher in Space program (here). 
The Concord Monitor, the paper for McAuliffe's home town, hasa lot of coverage. 
And the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center hasa number of events tonight.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the geeks among us, one of the odd results of the explosion was the way 
it launched Richard Feynmann into the popular consciousness, thanks to the way 
he dipped O-Ring rubber into cold water and put his finger on one of the main 
problems, not to mention the honesty of his harsh appendix to the Rogers 
Commission report (here). It concludes with what might be considered the Geek 
Motto: &quot;For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over 
public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.&quot;</p>

<p>Kindle books outsell paperbacks, hardbacks at Amazon.com</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No local angle, but one of those interesting and potentially important 
milestones happened this quarter: Amazon.com says it sold more Kindle books 
that paperbacks or hardbacks (although not both together, I don't think).It's 
in this press statement.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The newspaper business is hoping that someone electronic print will bring 
in enough money to keep traditional news organizations going in some form. 
Here's a small but intriguing example: ProPublica and the NY Times are selling 
long-form journalism as part of Amazon's &quot;short book&quot; program (5,000 
to 30,000 words or so).This column, by former Telegraph staffer Damon Kiesow, 
explains it - although he gets his wrist slapped with a pica pole for using the 
word &quot;monetize&quot; (ugh).</p>

<p>A recession silver lining: Lots less trash</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The city landfill in Nashua has seen the amount of stuff left by residents 
or picked up by trash haulers decline by 5,000 tons a year since 2007. Part of 
that is recycling, which has gone up about 1,500 tons a year over that time, 
but most of it appears to be the recession - we buy less junk that we toss out. 
That's a good thing, even if it comes from a painful cause.</p>

<p>&quot;Approval voting&quot; (vote for more than one candidate) sought for NH
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I will have a story in tomorrow's Telegraph about a proposal (this bill) to 
allow &quot;approval voting&quot; in NH - basically it would allow you to vote 
for as many different candidates as you wanted, e.g., you could have voted for 
all three governor candidates if you couldn't choose among them.The story isn't 
online yet (it got bumped by a big local story) so I can't link to it, (Here's 
the story online now, in a bit more readable fonts) and here's the unedited 
text for you GraniteGeekoids to ponder in advance. (Note that this law is 
almost certainly not going to go into effect any time soon, if at all, but it's 
still pretty interesting):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CONCORD &acirc;&#128;&#147;The phrase &quot;one man, one vote&quot; doesn't 
mean what you think it does, according to one of the more unusual laws being 
proposed in Concord.</p> 
<p><br>
 &quot;It refers to letting people vote fairly, and to having correct 
proportional representation,&quot; said Dan McGuire, a Republican state 
legislator from Epsom.</p> 
<p><br>
 What it doesn't mean, he said, is that each vote must be for just one 
man. In fact, McGuire thinks New Hampshire voters should be allowed to vote for 
as many people as they want in any race.</p> 
<p><br>
 He has sponsored a bill, HB240, which would tweak ballots for local 
and state elections in New Hampshire by &quot;allowing voters to vote for 
multiple candidates for an office.&quot;&nbsp; It will be the subject of a 
hearing Tuesday.</p> 
<p><br>
 The bill wouldn't let you vote for the same person more than once, 
but you could vote for multiple people running against each other.</p> 
<p><br>
 This approach, known as approval voting, is the simplest form of 
various alternatives to traditional voting patterns. Supporters say such 
alternatives create a better reflection of the electorate's overall opinion 
that the usual voting method, which is called first-past-the-post, or 
single-member plurality.</p> 
<p><br>
 &quot;This gives voters more options ... to reflect how they feel 
about all the candidates,&quot; McGuire said.</p> 
<p><br>
 To use an example which helped prod McGuire to draft the bill, 
consider November's election for governor, which had three candidates.</p> 
<p><br>
 McGuire, a Republican, liked the GOP candidate, John Stephen, but he 
liked the Libertarian candidate, John Babiarz, even more.</p> 
<p><br>
 Yet if he had voted for both of them his ballot would have been 
tossed out as invalid &acirc;&#128;&#147; even though it would have been an 
accurate reflection of his wishes.</p> 
<p><br>
 He ended up voting for Stephen because Babiarz had no chance of 
winning, which is the sort of &quot;gamesmanship&quot; voting that he'd like 
New Hampshire to avoid.</p> 
<p><br>
 If his law goes through &acirc;&#128;&#147; which McGuire admits is 
unlikely, at least in the short term &acirc;&#128;&#147; he could have voted 
for both Stephen and Babiarz even though only one seat was involved. In fact, 
he could have voted for John Lynch, as well.</p> 
<p><br>
 The multiple votes would have been tallied as always and the 
candidate with the most total votes would win, as currently happens. The most 
obvious different is that the total number of votes cast in the race would be 
greater than the total number of people who cast those votes.</p> 
<p><br>
 Approval voting is one type of alternative voting schemes, which have 
names like Cordorcet Method and instant-runoff balloting.</p> 
<p><br>
 These are occasionally used in circumstances such as electing boards 
to professional organizations or other organizations &acirc;&#128;&#147; a 
variant of approval voting was used to elect the Pope for several centuries, 
for example &acirc;&#128;&#147; but are almost never used for government bodies.
<br> The only nearby example of alternative voting for government office is in 
Cambridge, Mass., which uses instant-runoff voting for city elections. 
Burlington, Vt., used instant-runoff for a couple of its mayoral elections, but 
went back to the traditional method last year after the winner proved unpopular.
</p> 
<p><br>
 Other alternative voting schemes also allow voters to cast ballots 
for multiple candidates per seat, but are more complicated than traditional 
voting. They require voters to do such things as list the candidates in order 
of preference or give each one a varied score.</p> 
<p><br>
 The advantage of approval voting, McGuire said, is that the state and 
towns wouldn't have to redesign their ballots and people wouldn't have to 
change their voting habits, since the current method of voting for just one 
candidate per seat would still be allowed.</p> 
<p><br>
 McGuire admits to one drawback. His method would complicate 
vote-counting on election nights, particularly for communities like Mont Vernon 
and Lyndeborough that count all ballots by hand, rather than by the optical 
ballot-reading machines used in larger communities.<br>
 It would also make it 
harder to spot certain types of ballot-counting errors because overcounts 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; in which more votes are counted than ballots cast 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; would no longer be obvious.</p> 
<p><br>
 The bill is co-sponsored by three other first-term Republicans state 
legislators, but McGuire says that's a coincidence, reflecting the fact that 
they already know each other.</p> 
<p><br>
 &quot;This isn't a partisan issue. I don't think it benefits any 
party over any other,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p><br>
 McGuire and some other sponsors are associated with the Free State 
Project or similar limited-government political ideologies, groups that tend to 
be more open to non-traditional approaches to government. But he says this 
isn't a Free State Project idea.</p> 
<p><br>
 He also knows that it's unlikely to be accepted by the statehouse any 
time soon, due to novelty if nothing else.</p> 
<p><br>
 &quot;It's a little bit different, but it's the kind of thing that 
grows on you,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm hoping that the committee will take 
their time.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The value of oysters - for food and for the environment</p> 
<p>My column in the Telegraph today is about a couple of people applying to 
open or expand oyster farms in our coastal area. They're interested in the 
business aspect - oysters are a high-value food - but folks are seeking to 
return filter-feeding bivalves to coasts for environmental reasons, too, since 
they do a great job of cleaning tidal waters.Here's my column.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a big program in Alabama (see it here), and even the EPA wants to 
help them return to the beleaguered Chesapeake Bay (here).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another big solar plant on a Mass. landfill</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> 5.6-megawatt photovoltaicd plant - more than 2 times the output of all the 
PV in New Hampshire combined, by my estimation - is planned to cover a closed 
landfill in Canton, Mass. (Read the Globe story here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Closed landfills are proving to be good locations for what might be called 
small utility-sized PV plants - those in the single-digit megawatt range, which 
is too big for a single company to use but not really significant in the 
overall grid picture. A fossil-fuel or biomass power plant is rarely smaller 
than about 15 megawatts, and of course has much more total output over the year 
than a solar-powered plant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Landfills are flat, have no high-rise obstacles or trees to block the sun, 
and can't hold heavy stuff like buildings, so using them for a money-making 
(sort of) PV plant makes a lot of sense. PSNH wants to do that in Manchester, 
but there is a dispute about how they would pay for it.</p>

<p>News item: The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, in conjunction with the 
Contoocook Valley Radio Club (CVRC) and the New England Amateur Radio Festival 
(NEAR-Fest), has completed production of an amateur radio station. This 
station, KA1SKY, will be formally dedicated on Feb. 14 at 11 a.m.part of School 
Club Round-up Week, to 2009's station project manager Ken Rust, KB1PRV, who 
recently became a Silent Key. The station will now be called the Mumley-Rust 
Memorial Station.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The station will allow voice transmission and Morse code on thousands of 
frequencies of various wavelengths.&nbsp;With the guidance of volunteer amateur 
radio operators, visitors will be able to talk to other &quot;Hams&quot; around 
the world as well as contact the International Space Station when it is in a 
favorable position. Communication with satellites in space will also be 
possible in order to receive and make transmissions to other parts of the world.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A brief history of the project will be given by project manager Wayne 
Santos, N1CKM, followed by the dedication with station manager Peter Stohrer, 
K1PJS. Future plans for the station will also be presented by Santos and David 
McDonald, education director at the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center. The 
station will officially be open at 11:30 for student and public use.</p>

<p>Web doodad predicts if your school will call a snowday</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>A Web doodad called the Snowday Calculator, which seems to have been around 
for years, will &quot;predict&quot; the likelihood that your school will be 
called because of snow. It uses data taken from US weather service, your 
location, and some information you input such as whether the administration is 
&quot;easy, okay, harsh&quot; and the level of hype about the storm, based on 
Facebook chatter. Silly, but clever.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here it is.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is why companies don't leap at cool new technology</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The business world is usually pretty conservative, in a fiscal/business 
way. Any inventor or start-up can tell stories about potential customers 
deciding to stick with older, less effective technologies due to fear of the 
unknown.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But being cautious can make sense when you're dealing with lots of money, 
because new technology may let you down when it moves into the real world.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Consider the story of an intriguing heat pump, one that's more efficient 
and works better in cold weather, that was developed by an engineer and built 
by a small Bangor, Maine. It was a great story of the little guy leading the 
way to a more efficient world.</p>

<p>UNH oversees drilling of two-mile-long Antarctic ice core</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>From UNH News Service: The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide project 
closed out its fifth drilling season on Friday, Jan. 28, after reaching a depth 
of 3,331 meters &acirc;&#128;&#147; about two miles &acirc;&#128;&#147; thereby 
deriving the deepest ice core ever drilled by U.S. researchers. The WAIS Divide 
project, for which the University of New Hampshire provides science 
coordination, is investigating the last 100,000 years of Earth's climate 
history. The ice at 3,331 meters fell as snow about 100,000 years ago.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The drilling site is about 600 miles from the South Pole where the ice 
flows out to the sea in opposing directions &acirc;&#128;&#147; an ice divide. 
The location was selected because it is the best place on the planet to 
determine how greenhouse gases have changed during the last 100,000 years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The high annual snowfall at the site enables individual annual layers of 
snowfall to be identified and counted, much like counting tree rings, back to 
about 40,000 years. (Below that, the layers become too compressed to allow 
annual layers to be resolved.) Over time, the ice forms as snow is compacted at 
the surface by subsequent snowfall. The compacted snow contains dust, chemicals 
and atmospheric gases, which are trapped in the ice and are indicators of past 
climate. The deeper the ice, the further back in time measurements can be made.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mark Twickler, who heads up the WAIS Divide Science Coordination Office at 
UNH, says the ice cores are five-inch diameter cylinders that get cut into 
one-meter (three feet) sections. They are sent by ship and refrigerated truck 
to the NSF National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver. The ice is then cut into 
smaller samples and sent to 27 investigators around the U.S. who make the 
measurements. Part of Twickler's job is to divvy up the precious ice samples 
depending on specific researcher's investigations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to measuring what the atmospheric concentrations of carbon 
dioxide, methane, and other gases were in the past, the research team can also 
determine what the surface air temperature was in the past by studying changes 
in the isotopic composition of the water that makes up the ice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The WAIS Divide project is specifically investigating the small timing 
offsets between past changes in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse 
gases and changes in temperature. By understanding these timing offsets, the 
research team can determine the role changes in ocean circulation had in the 
release of carbon dioxide from the ocean and how an increase in carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere warms the planet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs funds the 
project, primarily through its Antarctic Glaciology Program.</p>

<p>McAuliffe Center: 40th anniversary of Shepard's moon flight</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord will be celebrating the 
40th anniversary of Apollo 14 - the ship that brought Alan Shepard to the moon 
- tonight at 7 PM, and throughout the day on Saturday, February 5 and Sunday, 
February 6.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On February 5, 1971, with Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa staying in 
orbit around the Moon, Commander Alan Shepard and Lunar Module Pilot Ed 
Mitchell touched down on the lunar surface in the Fra Mauro highlands. Shepard, 
the first American sent into space, was the fifth human to walk on the Moon, 
and famously took in a round of golf along the way.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Friday night's program will feature Dr. Mark McConnell and a look back on 
the Apollo 14 mission, how it was conducted, and how it contributed to our 
understanding of the Moon. The Discovery Center observatory will be open from 
7-10 PM. Following the program will be a free Skywatch outside with the New 
Hampshire Astronomical Society including personal telescope advice and 
assistance. Telescope viewing begins at 7 PM.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Presentations will be given on the Apollo 14 mission at 11:30, 1:30 and 
3:30 PM on Saturday and Sunday with a special<em>Tonight's Sky</em> planetarium 
show at 2 and 4 PM focusing on the Moon. Visitors will have a chance to try 
&quot;lunar golf&quot;. Featured exhibits will include the Discovery Center's 
Moon Rock exhibit, lunar crafts, and Lunar Lander Simulator where visitors can 
try touching down on the lunar surface. Special events are free with paid 
general admission.</p>

<p>UNH helps in massive genome analysis of the waterflea</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>From UNH News Service</strong>:</p> 
<p>From an environmental perspective, Daphnia pulex&nbsp; &acirc;&#128;&#148; 
the waterflea &acirc;&#128;&#147; is the best-studied organism on the planet. 
Scientists know how this species responds to pollution, predators, day and 
night, making it an important model for ecological and evolutionary research. 
Its genome, however, remained elusive, limiting understanding of how the 
environment and genes interact.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Until now. An international team of researchers comprising the Daphnia 
Genomics Consortium, including four from the University of New Hampshire's 
Hubbard Center for Genome Studies, has described the complete genome of Daphnia.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And, despite the Daphnia's near-microscopic size, it contains more than 
31,000 genes, more than any other animal with a complete gene sequence, 
including humans. The findings are detailed in an article in the journal 
Science this week.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;It's personally a major achievement,&quot; says W. Kelley Thomas, 
Hubbard Professor in Genomics and director of the HCGS, adding that the Daphnia 
sequence was among the center's original goals at its founding in 2001. 
&quot;This genome gives biologists and ecologists the tools they need to do 
genomic analysis on this organism from an ecological perspective.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The end product is a better understanding of what genes matter for 
organisms to cope with environmental stresses like pollutants and global 
warming and of the technologies necessary to understand how these genes 
function within an animal that is easily studied in water reservoirs around the 
globe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The study, &quot;The Ecoresponsive Genome of Daphnia pulex,&quot; was led 
by researchers at Indiana University's Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics 
(CGB), Utah State University, the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Genome 
Institute, and UNH's Hubbard Center. It found that the microscopic freshwater 
crustacean contains at least 30,907 genes, compared to approximately 25,000 in 
humans.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scientists have studied Daphnia for centuries because of its importance in 
aquatic food webs and for its transformational responses to environmental 
stress. Predators signal some of the animals to produce exaggerated spines, 
neck-teeth or helmets in self-defense. And like the virgin nymph of Greek 
mythology that shares its name, Daphnia thrives in the absence of males 
&acirc;&#128;&#148; by clonal reproduction, until harsh environmental 
conditions favor the benefits of sex.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Arguably, more is known about the ecology and stress biology of the water 
flea than any other animal. The genome project was conceived with an 
expectation that many new gene functions would be uncovered when studied in 
light of the animal's natural environment &acirc;&#128;&#148; not necessarily 
expecting to discover many more genes. Yet, Daphnia's genome is no ordinary 
genome.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Daphnia's high gene number is largely because its genes are 
multiplying, by creating copies at a higher rate than other species,&quot; said 
project leader and CGB genomics director John Colbourne. &quot;We estimate a 
rate that is three times greater than those of other invertebrates and 30 
percent greater than that of human.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;One theory is that Daphnia is so good at adapting to so many 
environments because it has this huge catalog of genes to call upon,&quot; says 
Thomas. The researchers note that more than one-third of Daphnia's genes are 
undocumented in any other organism &acirc;&#128;&#147; they are completely new 
to science.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At UNH, where the relatively new field of environmental genomics is at the 
core of the HCGS mission, the Daphnia project resulted in productive 
collaborations around the university. &quot;It was a significant part of 
starting many science careers,&quot; says Thomas, noting that many 
undergraduate, graduate and visiting students participated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Jim Haney, professor of freshwater biology, helped with cultures of 
Daphnia, which are common in New Hampshire lakes and ponds. In addition, as the 
science of genome sequencing evolved in the past decade to use &quot;fewer 
pipettes and more computers,&quot; says Thomas, the Hubbard Center forged 
strong bonds with UNH's computer science department, in particular professors 
Dan Bergeron and Phil Hatcher.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>International collaboration has been essential to this project. Over the 
course of the project, the Daphnia Genomics Consortium has grown from a handful 
of founding members to over 450 investigators distributed around the globe. 
Nearly 200 scientists have contributed published work resulting from the genome 
study, many in open-source journals published as a thematic series by 
BioMedCentral.</p>

<p>I don't just do geekery, but farm-and-forestry reporting, too</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Last night at the New Hampshire Farm and Forest Exposition, I won the 2011 
Fred Beane Award &quot;for achievement in reporting on issues and developments 
in the field of agriculture&quot;. It was fun, and I got to talk about one of 
my most enjoyable stories/columns, when I tried to calculate the number of 
leaves that change color in New Hampshire each leaf-peeping season. (Between600 
billion and 600 trillion, depending on which calculation you used.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm embarrassed to admit I don't know who Fred E. Beane was. This citation 
from the Eastern States Expositionfor an award given in 1974 says he was an 
&quot;unrivalled pioneer farm editor who, as an interpreter and communicator of 
the agricultural revolution, has done much to shorten the time-lag between 
research findings and their application on the farm,&quot; which sounds pretty 
cool.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm facing another mystery with this presentation, too. The short biography 
of me they prepared noted that I drew the comic strip for my college newspaper, 
a fact that is known to few people, none of whom are involved with the Farm 
&amp; Forest Expo. I wonder how the heck they found that out?!?!</p>

<p>Wearing ice crampons to shovel the roof</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>There is so much snow and ice on our roof that my wife and ice wore 
microspikes - a sort of mini-ice-crampon - when we went up there yesterday to 
shovel, to give ourselves more traction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the first time in 20 years here that I've shoveled off the roof out 
of concern about weight of snow buildup. We've had more snow in the past, but 
there have been intermittent warm days that make it slide off (I have a metal 
roof). Not this year.</p>

<p>Right whales like Gulf in Maine in winter</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>A mating ground for rare right whales has been found in the Gulf of Maine, 
about 60 miles offshore from Bar Harbor, reports the Glove. (Read the story here
)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But it's a weird mating ground by mammal standards: There aren't many 
females, and not much mating.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(Researchers) did not see whales mating, and the whales did not appear to 
be feeding. They did not seem to be doing much of anything.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article says there may be as few as 440 right whales left in the world, 
which doesn't sound big enough to maintain a population for such a large, 
slow-breeding animal.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The name comes because they contain lots of oil and floated when dead, 
which made it easier for whaling ships to snag them - that is, they were the 
right whales to look for.</p>

<p>One in 50 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan is a robot</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Wired has a piece pointing to a military report that 2,000 robots are being 
used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan, which means than one out of every 50 of our 
&quot;soldiers&quot; is a robot.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the Wired piece, which notes that &quot;these rolling and crawling 
bots are still pretty stupid. And there's not much hope they'll get any smarter 
anytime soon.&quot; It also points out that the 2,000 figure is delivered 
robots, which doesn't mean they've actually been deployed.</p>

<p>DEC cofounder Ken Olsen dies</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Two events created modern Nashua/southern New Hampshire: One was the 1952 
arrival ofSanders Associates, a defense electronics firm, into the empty mills 
left by the collapse of the textile industry, and the other was the early 1970s 
arrival of Digital Equipment Corp., expanding up from Massachusetts. The latter 
brought us firmly into the Route 128 technology-industry camp and set us on a 
path that we're still following.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The move was pushed by DEC cofounder Ken Olsen, who led its push to create 
a minicomputer alternative to mainframes. We should still be grateful that he 
didn't decide to go south to Rhode Island. DEC is now part of HP, and is still 
around, employing lots of local brainy folks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Olsen died yesterday at age 84. Here's the Globe obit.</p>

<p>Power lines and leukemia - is there any evidence of a link?</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>ADDENDUM: The state has a data tool that lets you look at public health 
information by time or geography. In NH, the number of child leukemia cases 
over the past 15 years is so small that it can't be divvied up among our 9 
counties, due to fears that individuals' privacy might be accidentally 
violated, so I can't take a look at whether the rates differ widely among parts 
of the state with fewer power lines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To find the site,check the state's leukemia page (here) and click on the 
Environmental Health Data Integration Network (EHDIN) link.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a big fight in New Hampshire over a proposal to build about 40 
miles of high-voltage DC power lines (which use enormous towers) over 
relatively untouched North Country hills, while the rest of the system would 
run over existing rights of way where other towers exist.The lines would bring 
1,200 megawatts of power down from large Quebec hydropower dams, roughly 
equivalent to the power output of Seabrook nuclear plant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are complicated economic arguments and environmental arguments about 
the plan (is &quot;big hydro&quot; green or not?), but I noticed from Tuesday's 
protests at Concord that the anti-powerline folks argue that the lines would 
increase childhood leukemia.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What's behind that argument is a confusing study in the UK. It found 
statistically significant increases in childhood luekemia within a certain 
distance of power lines - although the disease is still very rare - but&nbsp; 
cautioned that the numbers were so small that you shouldn't take the results 
seriously, partly because there's no way known to science that the lines could 
be causing leukemia.Here's a New Scientist story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A study that says &quot;we found a connection but it probably doesn't mean 
anything&quot; is bound to confuse everybody.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As the New Scientist story notes, it's particularly confusing because 
earlier, a &quot;UK Childhood Cancer Study report, which declared that there 
was no risk to children living these distances away from power lines.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire has a leukemia-tracking program that I'm going to check with. 
I don't think they have data to report yet, but you never know.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(A note about the system, which is branded Northern Pass: It would run 140 
miles of DC lines from the Canadian border to Franklin, in central N.H., where 
a $250 million (<em>oops</em>) converter terminal would switch it to AC power 
that would be carried 40 miles to the Deerfield station. High-voltage DC can 
carry electricity with great efficiency, losing much less power along the way 
than AC lines, but it's difficult and expensive to switch the power to the AC 
needed by our systems. Hence they tend to be big superhighway projects, with 
just a couple of &quot;off-ramps.&quot;)</p>

<p>An ice fishing tip-up that launches a model rocket</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>I have just stumbled upon (via Boing-Boing) what may be the ultimate geeky 
Northern New England item: An ice-fishing tip-up (the little device that 
signals when you've gotten a bite) which doesn't spring the usual flag, but 
which launches a model rocket!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can see the video here (from whence I stole the photo). Then you can 
writhe in envy or shake your head in disbelief at such a waste of effort - you 
choose.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By the way, a commenter to the post suggests that the creator, Mike Haeg, 
tie the fishing line to the rocket, so the catch can be pulled out of the hole 
automatically. But Haeg says that would be auto-setting, which is illegal in 
Minnesota ... but legal in Wisconsin. I wonder if it's legal in New Hampshire?

experiments on new materials and fuels for nuclear power.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once inside, you can see the structure that holds the actual reactor, which 
at its core is only 15 inches across. It's puny in terms of output, too, able 
to generate five megawatts of thermal power, compared to 1,000 megawatts or 
more of electric power (or about 3,000 megawatts of thermal power) from a 
commercial nuclear power plant. The current reactor was installed in 1975 and 
it uses a more highly enriched version of uranium fuel than a commercial plant.

<p>Remembering a visit to the old Science Park in Boston</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Last week my Telegraph column concerned upgrades to the Hayden Planetarium 
at the Boston Museum of Science, centered around technology from Nashua-based 
Sky-Skan. (Here's the column.) As part of it, we ran an old black-and-white 
photo from the MOS showing little kids looking at an earlier generation of star 
projectors. It was a cute picture - they were all dressed up in party dress and 
coat-and-tie - but the museum had no information about it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Well, guess what: The boy was a Nashuan and the picture came from a 1953 
book called &quot;Allan and Tricia Visit Science Park,&quot; created as a 
promotional item by the museum. It's &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; meet a 
proto-Carl Sagan; very fun.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I know this because his family called me after the story appeared. The 
whole story is in Dean Shalhoup's column today in the Telegraph -read it here. 
It's worth a read, because nobody tells a nostalgic tale like Dean-o.</p>

<p>The North Atlantic Oscillation and big snows - what's the link?</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Researchers are trying to pin down more of the connection between the North 
Atlantic Oscillation, which you might consider the north Atlantic's version of 
El Nino/La Nina, and big snow events.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a good, quick Columbia U. page about it, which dewcribes it like 
this: &quot;The NAO is the dominant mode of winter climate variability in the 
North Atlantic region ranging from central North America to Europe and much 
into Northern Asia. The NAO is a large scale seesaw in atmospheric mass between 
the subtropical high and the polar low.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Globe has an article about research today (read it here) which notes 
that the NAO is proving hard to predict:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The link between the North Atlantic Oscillation and snowfall is intriguing 
because the oscillation can go into decades-long periods where it is dominated 
by a positive or negative phase. From the mid-50s until the blizzard of '78, 
for example, it was in a negative phase more often than not, accompanied by 
some of the snowiest years of the past century. But in the 1979-1980 winter, a 
generally positive North Atlantic Oscillation took over until fairly recently. 
While some researchers believe there are discernable decade patterns to the 
oscillation, others say a good measurement record dates back only to 1950.</p>

<p>How J.C. Penney fooled Google and gamed Xmas-time searches</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The NY Times has a great, long article about how subtle link farms were 
used to push J.C. Penney to the top of a number of product searches on Google. 
The company says &quot;we didn't do it!&quot; but Google is pissed off and 
ramping down the company's results manually.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article ends with an interesting twist that will probalby piss off 
Google ever more: J.C. Penney is one of the largest purchaser of paid ads on 
Google - so perhaps the company was less inclined to crack down on its link 
farming? That's just the kind of question that European regulators are asking.

<p>Ken Olsen's legacy - nobody has quite matched it</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Still, the Massachusetts high-tech sector has never fully recovered from 
the collapse of Digital and the state's other leading computer companies.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's part of the conclusion from Hiawatha Bray's look at Digital 
Equipment Corp. in the light of the recent death of cofounder Ken Olsen. Among

manufacturing.&nbsp;Read tje article here.</p>

<p>Cape Cod erosion reveals Marconi's original broadcast towers</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The foundations of the Marconi radio towers on Cape Code 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; four 210-foot wooden towers used to broadcast the first 
wireless trans-Atlantic message, which went from Teddy Roosevelt to King Edward 
on Jan. 18, 1903 - were revealed by beach erosion caused by a big storm, 
reports Climatetide. From the posting: &quot;During the sixteen years the 
station was in operation, the shoreline moved 150 feet and began undercutting 
the two seaward towers. The foundations slid down the eroding cliff face to 
their current positions on the beach.&quot; It says they have occasionally been 
revelead and then re-covered by sands over the decades.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it better to back into parking spaces or park head-on?</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Slate has a really well-done piece about whether it's better to back your 
car into parking spaces, instead of entering them nose first.You can read it 
here, and it's worth the click through. It includes a link to a very funny 
parody site calledFancy Parking.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The argument, basically, is that you should go forward when there is more 
uncertainty because the driver can see better than when backing up, and there's 
more uncertainty when leaving a space (all those other folks zipping around the 
lot) than when entering it. Therefore, you should back in.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Makes sense, except when the lot is crowded and you're pulling into a tight 
space with little marging for error, since most of us need lots of margin for 
error when backing up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Personally, I always try to do the pull-through - find nose-to-nose empty 
spaces so you can drive in, and then drive out - even if you have to park 
further away from the store. A little walking is worth less hassle when 
leaving, I say.</p>

<p>Southern New Hampshire looks pretty good in the new interactive 
broadband-availability map released today by the FCC. You can turn on/off 
categories like xDSL (symmetiric or asymmetric, you choose), cable-modems 
(DOCSIS 3.0 or other), fiber-to-the-home, and various fixed wireless options.

<p>I'm flying out tonight to visit my dad, so I'll miss it, but the U-L 
reports that solar activity has scientists predicting good Northern Lights

<p>&quot;Ghosts&quot; like to show up on reflective surfaces - gee, I wonder 
why?</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Over the years, hotels, B&amp;Bs and restaurants have found that 
claiming&nbsp;to be haunted&nbsp;is a great way to get free publicity and draw 
an occasional curious customer. A Nashua restaurant is the latest&nbsp; local 
spot to take this&nbsp;route,&nbsp;with&nbsp;a lame YouTube &nbsp;video&nbsp;of 
people's reflections in a small glass window. Nobody was in the room to be 
reflected, they claim, so ghosts are the only possible explanation&nbsp;... and 
meanwhile, here are today's specials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&nbsp;certainly hope that if an afterlife does exist&nbsp;and has some 
ethereal connection to this world, we aren't forced to spend&nbsp;eternity 
flitting in and out of reflective surfaces in restaurants.</p>

<p>Study: If Vermont Yankee shuts, area's electric grid may suffer</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>A study by ISO New England, the folks who run the region's power grid, says 
that if the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant shuts next year, when its 
license runs out, &quot;potential thermal overloads and voltage violations were 
observed in almost every area of Vermont and New Hampshire. ... These issues 
exist with or without Vermont Yankee in service, but generally (but not always) 
tend to be more widespread and severe without Vermont Yankee.&quot;</p>

<p>Is a warmer climate killing off Minnesota's moose?</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The number of moose in northern Minnesota has declined, and it's not 
certain why - but this presentation, from a researcher in that state's Division 
of Fish and Wildlife, discounts hunting (which ended years ago) and says that 
warmer weather is a reasonable hypothesis: &quot;Non-hunting mortality was 
correlated with temperature indices, both seasonally and annually and these 
temperature indices have been increasing over the last 50 years.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The odd thing is that New England's moose population is doing pretty well 
-&nbsp;so well that they're spililng over into New York State,as a&nbsp;report 
from last October said. That seems to make correlations between population 
trends and changing climate a little tenuous, I would think.</p>

<p>Can you make electricity by squeezing water through holes in the breeze?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>No local connection here, but it's too intriguing not to mention: A 
Michigan start-up is trying to develop a wind-power system with no moving 
parts. The company's website gives no explanation; this comes from an article 
by Crane's Detroit Business (article here):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Water is pumped in as wind blows through, forcing a mist of tiny water 
droplets out pinholes in the aluminum. The flow of water creates a charge, just 
as it does in thunderheads as water droplets rise and fall on wind currents. 
Instead of forming bolts of electricity, though, the plan is that enough 
electrons will be collected and fed into the electrical grid.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The advantages are obvious - &quot;no moving parts&quot; is a goal to which 
all engineers aspire. Let's hope it actually works.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The company's name is Accio Energy, which makes it the first serious 
startup I know that usesa Harry Potter spell as part of its brand.</p>

<p>A smart grid needs electric substations to be more like telephone central 
offices</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>My Telegraph column talks about a local startup called ElectricRoute 
developing hardware/software to help electric substations - those thousands of 
mid-sized buildings scattered around the country that take high-voltage power 
from transmission lines and step it down so it can be handled by local power 
lines - talk to each other and to utilities' main offices, which is an 
important step in making a &quot;smart grid.&quot;</p>

<p>'Corn snow' is a real pain in the neck if you're measuring it</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Experienced weather-watchers have warned me that getting snow measurements 
will get harder as the winter goes on and the snow turns into &quot;corn snow
&quot; - a term for snow that has melted and refrozen over and over.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I found that out this morning. I've been out of town for a few days, so I 
wanted to get a snow-water-equivalent measurement of the snow in the yard, 
since the warm weekend lowered the levels from 22 inches to about 14 inches. 
But I gave up - it was so hard trying to bust through that stuff and collect it 
into a rain gauge that I didn't have time to do it before heading out to work. 
I'll have to get more serious about it tonight.</p>

<p>He accepts anything with a power cord or that runs on batteries. He then 
either refurbishes and resells the items or breaks them down into individual 
component piles, on site. Key to his operation is a machine he designed to 
handle toxic cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, turning the clunky glass innards from 
older-model TVs and computers into something called &quot;cullets,&quot; a 
glass-to-glass recycling process that generates a usable commodity.</p>

<p>NH statehouse wants out of RGGI greenhouse gas cap-and-trade</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p> ADDENDUM: New Hampshire Business Review has a good story about the vote, 
including the way PSNH cannot recoup from ratepayers the money it has spent on 
allowances.Read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Hampshire statehouse has voted to end our participation in the 
10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade greenhouse gas 
program for utilities. They've probably got the votes to override any veto from 
the governor, so I suspect it's time for us to say bye-bye toRGGI.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is no political surprise, since the Republican Party is unsympathetic 
to cap-and-trade and dubious about human-caused global warming*, and the GOP 
dominates New Hampshire. We were the last of the 10 states to join, three years 
ago.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>RGGI was limited in scope, since it only applied to power companies, and 
limited in effectiveness, since the recession had reduced demand to the point 
that the allowances, which allow utilities to release carbon while burning 
fossil fuel, were so cheap that they provided little financial incentive to 
reduce emissions. Still, it was an interesting attempt to curb our CO2tragedy 
of the commons.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The money paid by bidders for RGGI allowances was used to fund various 
energy-efficiency programs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>UPS (as in power supply) Recycling</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Filed under&nbsp;Environment,&nbsp;General,&nbsp;Software / computing
&nbsp;by&nbsp;earle&nbsp;at 12:33 pm</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the jobs I have down here in Florida is to give advice on computer 
equipment. We were casually discussing Uninterruptable Power Supplies when the 
director mentioned that he had thrown out several because the battery had died. 
What? Did you know you can buy new batteries for a fraction of the price of a 
new UPS?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Somehow that had never occurred to him that a $50.00 UPS could be fixed 
with a $17.00 battery. It never occurred to me to ask. Somehow, common 
knowledge isn't all that common. He is a smart guy, computer literate and good 
at his job. There was just this little disconnect that has cost the center some 
serious money. After looking around, I found several computers that didn't have 
any protection at all from lightning strikes. Florida has more of these than 
any other state.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I wrote up a proposal for more UPS along with links to battery replacement 
companies and prices. I have a couple of UPS units that were destined for the 
trash. My only reservation about them is that I don't know if the spike 
trapping varistors are still good. They can't be tested with what I have here, 
so protection isn't complete. Still, the ability to shut down computers 
gracefully is good to have.</p>

<p>U.S. has been snowy but dry this winter, says NASA</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>My morning CoCoRaHS measurement found that I'd gotten 2 1/2 inches of snow, 
which melted down to 0.27 inches of water - roughly a 10-to-1 ratio, which is 
&quot;typical&quot; for snow, within a large variation. (The snow is starting 
to turn to rain/ice at the moment - ugh.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I mention this to lead into an excellent item from the NASA Earth 
Observatory showing a picture illustration snow cover in the US throughout the 
month of January. They caution that lots of snow doesn't mean lots of moisture:
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The winter storms brought more snow, but less rain to much of the United 
States said the National Climatic Data Center. January 2011 was the 
ninth-driest January in the United States in 117 years. The southern half of 
the country was particularly hard hit. New Mexico experienced its driest 
January on record.</p>

<p>When incandescent bulbs disappear - so will the Easy Bake Oven!</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The U.S. is slowly banning incandescent light bulbs (cue lamentation or 
celebration, depending upon your mood). This is a good thing for the world, but 
Salon points out that it has an odd side effect: The Easy Bake Oven is going to 
hurting.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I didn't play with an Easy Bake Oven as a kid - gender stereotypes, you 
know - but I certainly saw enough commercials for them. They are one of those 
products that summarize the weird wonder of childhood; the fact that you cooked 
food with a 100-watt light bulb is just so charmingly goofy that it's 
irresistable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hasbro, Salon says, is going to replace it with &quot;the Easy-Bake 
Ultimate Oven. Only this time it's going to be fired with some zippy little 
heating element, which means that some kid somewhere is going to be very 
unhappy when his parents rip the thing apart insisting that they can change the 
bulb themselves.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's a good article -&nbsp;read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a side note, I love the description of incandescent bulbs&nbsp;here: 
&quot;Incandescent lights are basically electric space heaters that give off 
light as a byproduct.&quot;</p>

inches of snow on the ground in my yard into 20.5. But boy, is it dense: It 
melted down to 4.8 inches of water, which is just a tiny bit over 4-1 water 
equivalent. Very, very dense.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a sign of how much energy it takes to break ice bonds, I had to pour 5 
inches of nearly boiling water into the rain gauge to melt what turned out to 
be 4.8 inches worth of ice/snow, and it still took about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>RGGI created $404 million in efficiency, and NH believes climate is changing
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even as New Hampshire ponders leaving the Regional Greenhouse Gas 
Initiative, the program says the 10 states in the pact have used $404 million 
in auction payments, mostly from utilities, to pay for various efficiency 
programs. (Reuters story here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On a slightly related note, Larry Hamilton of UNH points out that surveys 
by the Carsey Institute say the state's public isn't friendly to climate-change 
skeptics:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(Surveys) consistently show that a<strong>bout half of NH residents believe 
climate is changing now caused by human activities</strong>; about 40% agree 
it's changing now but due to natural forces; and less than 10% think it's not 
changing now. We wrote one report about these poll results last summer -PDF here
. Since then we've done three more statewide surveys (plus one in the North 
Country), all getting about the same results.</p>

<p>A real alien invasion makes it to the movies: Asian longhorned beetles</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The cost of making document films has plummeted in the past decade, and 
there are more than you can shake a stick at (even a stick containing an 
invasive beetle), but here's another one to think about: &quot;Bugged: The Race 
to Eradicate the Asian Longhorned Beetle.&quot; Made by a Fitchburg, Mass., 
native, it concerns the problems at Worcester, Mass., where 25,000 trees were 
turned into chips for a power plant because they contained beetles, as well as 
other places where the beetle has appeared.</p>

<p>Don't you want to get up early and measure snow in the morning?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As I have mentioned before - probably too many times - I have joined a 
volunteer group called CoCoRaHS (Community Collaborative Rain Hail Snow 
network). You buy high quality rain gauge, get a little online training, and 
become part of a Web-based data gathering national network that, among other 
things, gathers data to help predict flash flooding.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's weirdly satisfying, in a weather-geeky way, to upload your backyard 
numbers and see your data on the state and national map. I've also found it 
quite interesting to learn the water equivalence in this year's snowfall - it 
gives a real quantitative kick to the vague &quot;this snow is heavy, that snow 
is light&quot; feeling I've always had.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Admittedly, it's kind a pain at times, since the measurements should be 
done by 8 a.m.. But it's not like you get fined if you slip: I've missed 
several days and I've only been doing it six months. Another drawback is that 
you have to buy the rain gauge, which isn't cheap - $25 or so. It's a really 
nice rain gauge, though.</p> 
<p>March is their recruitment month. Why not check it out?</p>

<p>The eastern cougar is extinct; long live other cougar subspecies!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The question of cougars is a contentious one in New Hampshire. There are a 
number of people who swear they have seen one in the wild, but officials point 
to the lack of any proof - no good footprints, no hair tufts caught on barbed 
wire, no photos from handheld cameras or the many automatic &quot;critter 
cams&quot; in the woods - and say that the sightings are probably of bobcats, 
which are bigger than most people realize. But nobody is quite certain; while 
breeding pairs are highly unlikely, it's possible that a wild animal or two has 
escaped from captivity and is lurking near Mount Monandock or the White 
Mountains.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, if we do have any cougars, they're not eastern cougars, because 
that species is now officially extinct. This isn't big news, actually - as U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service says: &quot;Although the eastern cougar has been on 
the endangered species list since 1973, its existence has long been questioned. 
... Reports of cougars observed in the wild examined during the review process 
described cougars of other subspecies, often South American subspecies, that 
had been held in captivity and had escaped or been released to the wild, as 
well as wild cougars.&quot; (You can see the site here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The last confirmed eastern cougar was trapped in 1938.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the McAuliffee-Shepard Discovery Center tomorrow, March 4, a 
presentation of planetarium show<em>Tonight's Sky</em> will be held at 7 p.m., 
followed by a talk from Martin Ratcliffe, writer for Astronomy Magazine and 
former president of the International Planetarium Society. As author and editor 
of<em>Cosmology and the Evolution of the Universe</em>, he is involved in 
searching for answers to questions like: How did our universe begin? What is 
its fate? With a focus on cosmology and exciting new instruments being 
developed, his presentation will explore what astronomers expect to learn about 
the early origins of the universe as we achieve the ability to reach back to 
the first stars and first galaxies formed in the universe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Discovery Center observatory will be open from 7-10 PM. Following the 
program will be a free&nbsp; Skywatch outside with the New Hampshire 
Astronomical Society including personal telescope advice and assistance. 
Telescope viewing begins at 7 PM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Incandescent bulbs are like a gas pump that leaks 80% of the time</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My column on Monday is about incadescent light bulbs and how they're, 
thankfully, finally being phased out. I'm still writing it, but I'm rather 
proud of the metaphor that I open with:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Imagine if gas stations installed pumps that spilled four-fifths of 
everything you bought.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You'd fork out $10 but only get $2 worth of gas in the tank. The rest would 
spill onto the ground, stinking up the joint and polluting the groundwater.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Outrageous! We wouldn't stand for it!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Actually, we might &acirc;&#128;&#147; because that's what happens every 
time we turn on a traditional light bulb.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Incandescent bulbs, which force electricity through tungsten wires until 
they come so close to melting that they glow, have been described as space 
heaters that release light as a by-product. This sounds like a joke but is 
pretty accurate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;You're losing as much as 90 percent of your input watts in 
heat,&quot; said Joe Murdoch, a professor emeritus of electrical engineering 
from UNH who has written a number of books about lighting.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Math professor who wrote novels on the physics of golf</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Several years ago I wrote about Francis Scheid, a then-86-year-old former 
math professor who had written four self-published novels around the 
mathematics and physics of golf, thus combining two loves. To be perfectly 
honest they were not the best-written of stories - creating dialogue, as I 
found when I tried writing novels in my youth, is much harder than it looks - 
but the approach was intriguing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As was Scheid. He got his math PhD from MIT and was a math teacher for the 
Navy, which took him to the souht Pole, Burma and Switzerland, among other 
places. he also spent decades teaching at Boston University.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Earlier this week he died, at age 90. His family wrote a long obituary 
discussing his personality, which isworth a perusal here. (My column has 
disappeared in a web system switchover, or I'd show it to you as well).</p>

<p>Big cat sightings prove to be as elusive as the cats</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ADDENDUM: Here's the story, complete with some really cool historic photos.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm writing a story for the Sunday Telegraph about mountain lions in NH, 
spurred by the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service's decision to declare the eastern 
cougar extinct, as noted inan earlier blog post. (Other subspecies, including 
the Florida panther, are doing fine.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One thing I'm finding is that &quot;friend of a friend&quot; reports get 
less exciting as you hunt them down. Here's an example: One person I talked to 
told me a friend of his once saw a cougar in a tree, where it had taken a deer 
carcass. Awsome! Alas, I finally talked to the guy - it turns out he saw 
week-old, cougar-like footprints pointed out by other people, who say a nearby 
deer carcass had been moved during the night, just like cougars do.</p>

<p>UNH finds home routers/modems aren't ready for IPv6</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NetworkWorld has a report on a recent &quot;Plugfest&quot; test of home 
routers and modems atUNH's InterOperability Lab, one of the nation's foremost 
places to see whether equipment is ready for IPv6, and says the results weren't 
pretty, although details are scarce because labs &quot;are typically 
tight-lipped about Plugfest results.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Equipment makers don't have an endless supply of time to get it right. IPv4 
depletion for U.S. companies isfully expected to occur in 2011. ARIN says it 
has around 80 million IPv4 addresses left and expects to run out of these 
addresses within nine months. We will soon see a day when new computers, 
servers, mobile devices and the so-called Internet of Things can only get an 
IPv6 address. Carrier-grade NAT (CGN, also known as large-scale NAT) will 
suffice as a stopgap measure, but it comes with its own set of problems</p>

<p>Measuring snow is not organic chemistry, thankfully</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My wife was watching me doing my weekly snow-water-equivalent measurement 
this morning: pack the full depth of snow (16&quot; - melting has begun) into 
the rain gauge, then pour in measured amounts of hot water to melt it down. She 
cringed watched me dribble a little bit of water on the counter here and splash 
a tiny bit out of the beaker there, and finally couldn't help herself: 
&quot;You'd have real problems in organic chemistry, where the amount left on 
the (stirring) spoon would make a difference.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lab work was never my strong suit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 16 inches of snow melted down to 5.2 inches of water, which is the most 
water equivalent I've measured in the yard this year. It's supposed to rain and 
be above 40 degrees all day, so the snow should get super-saturated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And just to remind me that it's the end of winter, my attic is leaking.</p>

<p>Good riddance to incandescent bulbs</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today is a borderline rant about how the out-moded 
technology of incandescent lights should have disappeared from homes a while 
ago.Here it is.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I expect it will get at least as much reaction as my &quot;looking for 
mountain lions&quot; and &quot;parking backwards is best&quot; column. Who says 
geeky stuff doesn't draw responses?</p>

<p>Are energy efficient devices really better for the environment?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yesterday in my Telegraph column I lambasted incandescent light bulbs 
because they're grossly inefficient (drawing a lively conversation in the 
comments section, as you'll see if you check it out.) But there is a 
non-trivial section of the economic and environmental community which worries 
about theJevons Paradox, aka &quot;rebound effect,&quot; in which greater 
efficiency leads people to use more of the product, negating energy savings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Yorker had an excellent, long piece about it in December that is 
well worth a read (here), while the NY Times has a piece about it today (here). 
The Times quotes this from a research paper:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Consider what's happened with lighting over the past three centuries. As 
people have switched from candles to oil-powered lamps to incandescent bulbs 
and beyond, the amount of energy needed to produce a unit of light has 
plummeted. Yet people have found so many new places to light that today we 
spend the same proportion of our income on light as our much poorer ancestors 
did in 1700, &quot;Many have come to believe that new, highly-efficient 
solid-state lighting &acirc;&#128;&#148; generally LED technology, like that 
used on the displays of stereo consoles, microwaves and digital clocks 
&acirc;&#128;&#148; will result in reduced energy consumption. We find the 
opposite is true.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hmmm ... perhaps my incandescent scorn was misguided?</p>

<p>&quot;Magical thinking&quot; makes us buy celebrity stuff</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm suffering from a covering-town-meeting hangover, so I'll indulge in a 
quirky non-local tidbit: An NY Times story about social scientists tying the 
habit of paying big bucks for celebrity stuff, like Eric Clapton's old guitar, 
to superstitious beliefs and &quot;magical thinking&quot; about properties 
being linked to physical objects.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I dunno. I was a Clapton freak as a youngster, but I don't think I'd ever 
cough up&nbsp; $960,000 for his old guitar.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the story - which notes that even replicas of Clapton's guitar sell 
for $20,000. That's an example of &quot;imitative magic&quot;, which is also 
reflected when you stab pins into voodoo dolls that like like your enemy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Study: Some randomly chosen politicans would improve democracy</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After covering town meeting for 10 towns, I'm attuned to elections at the 
moment, so let me note a paper by Cornell physicists which has this summary: 
&quot;A small number of randomly selected legislators mixed with elected ones 
should make parliaments more effective. ...&nbsp; These results are in line 
with both the ancient Greek democratic system and the recent discovery that the 
adoption of random strategies can improve the efficiency of hierarchical 
organizations.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire has a different Daylight Saving Time than the rest of the 
country</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Apparently having the first-in-the-nation political primary isn't enough 
for New Hampshire: We want to have the&nbsp;first-in-the-nation Daylight Saving 
Time, too.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It seems that when the federal government changed daylight saving time back 
in 2007, New Hampshire forgot that that we have a state law on the topic. As a 
result,&nbsp;there is a state law (RSA 21:36) that says Eastern Daylight Time 
starts weeks later in New Hampshire than in the rest of the county (first 
Sunday in April rather than second Sunday in March) and ends weeks&nbsp;earlier 
(last Sunday in October rather than first Sunday in November.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Legislators are scrambling to change this rather embarrassing discrepancy 
with a bill (HB61) that would put us back in line with the feds before we 
change our clocks next week. But that seems a little cowardly in today's 
political environment, when state's rights are all the rage.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Perhaps&nbsp;we should instead keep the difference and celebrate Granite 
State Daylight Time as the chronological embodiment of our independent 
heritage. We could create a militia to&nbsp;line state borders and keep out 
clocks showing Massachusetts Time. Or maybe the law should be changed to say 
that any sunlight that originates entirely within New Hampshire is exempt from 
federal Daylight Savings regulations.*</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* note to non-NH readers - these are referencers to a couple particularly 
interesting laws that have been proposed lately.&nbsp; Don't worry if you don't 
get the joke.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The BMSB stink bug</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two new invasive bugs set their sights on New Hampshire</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Did you know that the state has a program in which bugs are collected from 
filters in people's swimming pools, and then analyzed? Me neither, but now I 
know why it exists: It has spotted the arrival of the brown marmorated stink 
bug (BMSB), an invasive pest from east Asia that was spotted in Pennsylvania in 
the 1990s and which has spread to 32 states. It caused a 10 percent apple crop 
loss in Pennsylvania and Delaware one year, so it's nothing to sneeze at.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A release from the Division of Plant Industry in the state Department of 
Agriculture says BMSB and another pest that is on its way here but hasn't been 
spotted yet, the spotted wing drosophila (SWD), &quot;cause damage in a 
wide-array of agricultural crops, and both can subsist in non-agricultural 
plants, like forest and ornamental trees, in the absence of a suitable 
agricultural host. This means that both can sustain populations at a size large 
enough to allow for rapid infestation when an agricultural crop becomes 
available.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They're asking people to keep an eye out for BMSB and send &quot;high 
quality digital photos or specimens to the task force involved with determining 
how widespread it is throughout the state.&quot; For more information, check:
http://extension.unh.edu/Agric/AGPMP/Brownmarmoratedstinkbug.htm</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some details:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;In early fall, BMSB aggregates inside homes and other structures in 
search of a protected shelter from winter's harsh conditions. It is very good 
at finding cracks and crevices into homes, trunks of automobiles, etc. It is 
this habit that caused it to be considered, from the first, a homeowner's 
nuisance rather than an agricultural pest. It wasn't until the early 2000s that 
the first BMSB began to be detected in crops across the mid-Atlantic 
region.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;SWD differs from other drosophilids, known collectively as 
&quot;vinegar flies,&quot; in that the apparatus with which the female lays 
eggs in host material (the ovipositor) is serrated like a saw, which allows her 
to cut her way into ripening and ripe fruit to lay her eggs, and is not 
restricted, as are the other vinegar flies, to already rotting fruit. Once the 
eggs hatch, they become larvae, commonly known as maggots, which feed on the 
fruit, spoiling it for human consumption. SWD can readily feed in soft-skinned 
fruits, like nectarines, blueberries, raspberries, cherries, and strawberries. 
It has also been observed utilizing alternate hosts like crabapple and dogwood. 
It has multiple generations in a year, so that populations can build up and be 
quite large by harvest.&quot;</p>

<p>Forums are dead, long live the forums</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Telegraph has ended its &quot;forums&quot; section, which created 
discussion areas for general topics that were supposed to draw crowds of people 
who would have lively, intelligent debate prodded by our news stories, thus 
drawing hordes of eager advertisers. They never really took off, and as the 
Telegraph's closing-them-down notice says, &quot;Forum participation has 
withered over the past several months as more readers post their opinions 
directly to online articles. This trend is not unique to nashuatelegraph.com. 
Most online newspapers have phased out broad-based issue forums in favor of 
encouraging readers to interact to specific news articles and features.&quot;

<p>Most of your body heat doesn't escape through your head</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Many times over the years I have written about the incorrect idea that some 
&lt;bignum&gt; percentage of our body heat escapes through our heads, as if our 
craniums were a sort of biological radiator while the rest of our skin was 
insulation. The reality is that our surface heat radiation is roughly similar 
over most of our body, with some variation due to amount of blood supply near 
the surface, depth of subcutaneous fat, presence of heair, etc.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since our heads tend to be the only part that is uncovered in winter time, 
the actual truth is a &lt;bignum&gt; percentage of heat *that escapes from our 
body when we're outdoors* escapes from our head. Quite different.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I bring this up because (a) I have nothing else to write about, (b) winter 
is slowly disappearing, and (c) the Speed Bump cartoon this morning is a very 
funny take on the topic -so read it here.</p>

<p>Call it the anti-Ark museum</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We visited the Harvard Museum of Natural History yesterday to see a talk. 
It's a charmingly old-fashioned museum, best known as the home of theglass 
flowers, a huge collection of incredibly detailed and accurate models of 
flowers and plants made out of glass a century ago. Even the labels on the 
exhibits look old-fashioned, with the sort of typography I expect to see in 
flyers for snake-oil nostrums.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Most of the museum consists of stuffed animals, life-sized versions of 
hundreds, probably thousands, of species, from hummingbirds to elephants, from 
giraffes to platypuses (or whatever the plural is), plus insects and primates 
and reptiles and amphibians and fish by the zillions, crammed into glass cases. 
None of this interactive-exhibit nonsense for them, thank you very much.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's weirdly fascinating, but I realized as I wanted through room after 
room that it's also a brilliant counter-example to Noah's Ark literalists. The 
collection barely touches on the range and number of species on the planet; yet 
it's so huge that it shows the mysterious linear unit &quot;cubit&quot; would 
have to equal a football field or more to build a boat that could hold two of 
everything - even when discounting fishes, flying birds, bats and dinosaurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Somehow I doubt that the Noah's Ark museum geting $37 million in tax breaks 
in Kentucky (story here) will really tackle this question.</p>

<p>Not much snow, lots of water</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have roughly 7 inches of snow left in my yard (depending on where you 
measure, there are bald patches and foot-deep spots) which isn't much. But that 
doesn't mean there isn't a lot of water there: I melted it down this morning to 
3.2 inches of water equivalence, or darn near 2-1. No wonder it feels like 
blocks of ice when you walk on it!</p>

<p>Region's nuclear power sector watches, waits</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a story in the Telegraph today about the region's five nuclear power 
plants - to be four next year, if the Vermont Yankee shutdown goes through - 
and the possible effect of the crisis in Japan. There's lots of &quot;it's too 
early to tell&quot; in it, I'm afraid.Read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>good prime (Nuclear Energy 101) that includes this note: &quot;Remember, 
this is really just an emergency shutdown gone awry. The control rods are still 
in place. The Jenga columns are still separated. So, over time, the fission 
reactions will still slow down and stop. As they do, heat levels will drop, and 
so will levels of radiation.I didn't have room to get into detail about how 
nuke plants work and what's happening in Japan. Really, what we have here is a 
waiting game. The goal is to keep the reactors stabilized long enough that the 
shutdown can completely shut down.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The world, incidentally, has 443 operating nuclear power plants and, due 
largely to expansion plans in China and India, could have twice as many in a 
decade or two,says the NY Times.</p>

<p>We do have earthquakes here, but barely - and no tsunamis</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ADDENDUM: A reader points out that I overstated the impossiblity of 
tsunamis on the East Coast;check here for a report, which lists them as 
&quot;rare but possible.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a Telegraph story today about the region's nuclear power industry, 
in which I make the lazy statement that New England doesn't have earthquakes. 
That's not true, as I well know - 5 of them have been recorded in New Hampshire 
already this year - but it is true that we don't have earthquakes of a scope to 
worry nuclear power plants. None of our quakes this year have topped magnitude 
2.6, which is barely noticeable on the ground. The two biggest recorded quakes 
in NH history were both in 1940 near Lake Ossipee, at magnitude 5.5 - which is 
still well below the usual measurement of a &quot;large&quot; quake, magnitude 
6.0. (The Japan quake was magnitude 8.9)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for a tsunami, here's a quote from UNH geophysics professor Margaret 
Boettcher in response to an email query of mine: &quot;It is also quite 
unlikely that the east coast will be hit by a tsunami generated by fault slip 
in the Atlantic because there are very few subduction zones (the type of plate 
boundary that Japan and Chile are on) in the Atlantic.&quot;</p>

<p>Japan disaster - is it a push for &quot;mini-nuke plants&quot;?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let's take a moment to recognize some true heroes - a term that is bandied 
about far too loosely. I mean the workers at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear 
Power Station in Japan, roughly 50 people who have put themselves in harm's way 
in order to save the health and lives of millions. We can only hope to emulate 
those engineers, mechanics and craftsmen if the need ever arose. (Article here)
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As Japan continues to struggle with the damaged nuclear plants, here's a 
column that says the issue may give a boost to relatively small (10 megawatt or 
so) self-contained reactors, which are sealed at the factory, put in place for 
roughly 20 years, then returned to the factor when they need refueling. The
Toshiba 4S is the model. They are sodium-cooled and have enough passive cooling 
that if they lose power they still don't overheat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Check this column by Robert Cringley, which also talks about how the 
current disaster is much less bad than Chernobyl was.</p>

<p>85th anniversary of Goddard's first rocket</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Today is the 85th anniversary of Robert Goddard's launch of the first 
liquid-fueled rocket, on his Aunt Effie's farm just south of Worcester, 
Mass.&nbsp; Here'san article from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where 
Goddard attended and which for obvious reasons has embraced the father of 
rocketry's memory.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a Wired.com piece, which is pretty good except it says the farm is 
in Connecticut. All those small New England states look the same when viewed 
from afar, I guess ...</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NRC: Mass. nuclear plant has relatively high earthquake risk</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory commisson says all of America's 104 nuclear power 
plants are prepared for earthquakes, meaning each has a better than 1 in 10,000 
chance of a core breach due to an earthquake. But as Bill Dedman of MSNBC 
notes, the plants with the highest relative risks are all on the east coast, 
because the perceived lack of earthquake risk means they were built with less 
protection that plants in California.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Notably, No. 2 on the list is Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Mass., 
between Boston and Cape Cod. It has a calculated risk of 1 in 14,493 of a core 
breach. (Seabrook in N.H. is No. 36 at 1 in 45,455; Vermont Yankee is No. 70, 
at 1 in 123,457.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dedman's report (you can read it here) points out that the odds of a breach 
has increased for most power plants because new research has raised the 
likelihood of earthquakes throughout the country - although it's still very low 
in New England.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Speaking of Pilgrim, until it was pointed out by a reader this morning I 
didn't realize that it, like Vermont Yankee, is trying to get its federal 
license renewed. For both plants, their license runs out next year. The NRC 
staff has given Pilgrim thumbs up for environmental and safety issues, and the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board is in the midst of hearings. The issue is 
likely to come up for a vote before the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
this year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pilgrim doesn't need state approval, however, while Vermont Yankee does, 
thanks to Vermont's unique set of state laws.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rocketry remembered</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I read a lot about Goddard's rocket experiments in early issues of Pop 
Science/Mechanics and other magazines from the 30's and 40's. I was absolutely 
thrilled when I was able to go to guided missile schools when I joined the 
Navy. Even better, my first assignment was on the USS Norton Sound, a seaplane 
tender converted to a missile test ship. We had hundreds of missile firings 
equipped with telemetry heads instead of explosive warheads.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was assigned to the telemetry room with big multitrack Ampex tape 
recorders and receivers to maintain and modify according to what the civilian 
engineers needed. With 1/2&acirc;&#128;&sup3; tape, 60 inches a minute and 8 
tracks, we recorded everything happening in the Terrier or Tartar missiles as 
they headed out inside a nutating radar beam towards a target drone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Later, I worked in one of the missile test bays where we tested the rockets 
before being launched.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After I got out of the Navy, I worked as a field engineer on missile launch 
systems and associated equipment. Then as a technical writer and teacher at the 
guided missile school in Mare Island, California.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rocketry is still one of my intense interests limited now to bottle rockets 
using water and compressed air to launch 2 liter soda bottles a few hundred 
into the air. A recent thrill was touring the Cape Canaveral center here in 
Florida, seeing examples of little rockets like those I worked on up to the 
Saturn V with moon lander suspended in air a few feet above our heads. I still 
get a little weak in the knees thinking about how lucky I've been.</p>

<p>What exactly do those sewage-treatment disks do?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UPDATE: I posted an item earlier today wondering what exactly those 
floating disks, accidentally released from a N.H. wastewater treatment plant, 
do. I've since done some interviews and written a story that will run this 
weekend. I have replaced the earlier post with (an unedited version) of my 
story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The little white disks that washed out of the Hooksett wastewater treatment 
plant last week and flowed down the Merrimack River, creating an unusual litter 
problem on the beaches of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, exist for an 
odd-sounding reason: to give bacteria a place to sit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They're called Kreuger Biofilm Chips, and are made by a German firm that 
specializes in wastewater treatment systems. Hooksett was the first plant in 
the U.S. to buy them, according to Kreuger.<br>
 The plastic disks, made via 
injection molding, are used to increase the amount of bacteria in aeration 
tanks, the huge ponds hold sewage for biological break-down as part of 
treatment process.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;They look like honeycomb cereal, a little bigger than that,&quot; 
said Mario Leclerc, manager of the Nashua Wastewater Treatment plant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nashua does not use the disks in its treatment plant. In fact, no place in 
New Hampshire other than Hooksett uses them, according to the state Department 
of Environmental Services.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Leclerc snagged a couple of the disks during a visit to Plum Island, at the 
mouth of the Merrimack River. It is one of the places where tens of thousands 
of the disks have washed up in recent days, leading to volunteer efforts and 
lots of argument about who has to bear the cost.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The disks float around in aeration tanks and provide a place for helpful 
bacteria to grow, so the microbes can chomp on sewage floating by and break it 
down.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The open grid pattern of the disks increases the amount of surface area 
that can hold bacteria.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Kreuger says the disks have a whopping 1,200 square meters of surface area 
for every cubic meter of material &acirc;&#128;&#147;&nbsp; 200 times as much 
surface area as exists on similar amount of material in the shape of a cube.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hooksett bought the disks because it wanted to upgrade the plant without 
the enormous expense of building bigger or more aeration ponds. Nashua uses 
suspended growth treatment system, which depends on the bacteria floating 
around in the water and sludge. There are other methods to increase bacteria 
counts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Tanks can only support so only many organisms. To get more organisms 
there, you have to make it bigger somehow,&quot; said Leclerc. &quot;In other 
plants, they have 'fingers' attached (to the tank to increase surface area). 
There are all kinds of technologies.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The floating-disk method is pretty new in the U.S., which may explain 
Hooksett's difficulties. The treatment plant had a screen that caught the disks 
and kept them from getting into the Merrimack River, but heavy rains 
overwhelmed the system and pushed over the screen.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This isn't the first time the problem has occurred. In April of last year, 
a million similar disks escaped the sewage treatment plant in Groton, Conn., 
and washed up along nearby beaches.</p>

<p>The complicated story of trash-to-energy plants</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Trash-to-energy plants sound, on the face of it, like a no-brainer - they 
get rid of something we don't want, turning it into something we do want. But 
they have a long history of cost overrides and pollution (trash is a real mixed 
bag of a fuel and it's hard to eliminate all the unpleasant byproducts). Tux 
Turkel at the Portland Free-Press takes a typically long, nuanced look at the 
issue in his state, which has four major such plants.&nbsp;Read it here.</p>

<p>Self-publishing a tech book is no way to make money</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is a general idea in the &quot;information wants to be free&quot; 
community that people who write can make a living by giving away their work, 
because this will increase their overall audience and as a byproduct increase 
the small proportion of people willing to pay for your work. Forcing everybody 
to pay, they opine, will just make your audience disappear and cut your income.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Slashdot pointed me to the story of one guy who tried this, with a 
self-published book about Ubuntu, the Linux distribution. He's an experienced, 
already-known writer. His result (read it here): At least 500,000 free copies 
have been downloaded, and in two years he has made $9,000. From the report:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>I estimate I have to give away 446 copies of the eBook for every sale 
of the print edition. ...</em><em>The book's been a success in terms of 
providing a free educational resource for the Ubuntu community, and I'm very 
proud of this achievement. But<strong>as a commercial endeavour, I wouldn't 
recommend anybody take a self-publishing route.</strong></em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you want to earn money from writing, write magazine journalism. If you 
really want to write a book, get signed to a publisher. If you want an 
adventure then try self-publishing. Just don't expect to do much more than 
cover your costs, though.</p>

<p>Deer hunting rules are an interesting bio-control mechanism</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today is about a proposal to institute antler point 
restrictions in parts of New Hampshire for parts of the deer hunting season. 
These would require that hunters can only kill a deer with &quot;at least one 
antler 3 inches long measured from the tip of the main beam along the distal 
edge of the antler to the base of the antler burr at the skull, plus at least 
two antler points that branch from the main beam that are at least 1 inch from 
the tip to the confluence with the closest edge of the main beam.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The column looks at the way hunting rules can be used to control the 
demographic profile of the herd - in this case, to keep down the percentage of 
males who are under two years old.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ADDENDUM: John Harrigan, the north country columnist for the Union-Leader, 
writes about it in the Sunday U-L - he thinks it's probably a bad idea, too 
focused on creating &quot;trophy&quot; animals. He's definitely closer to the 
hunting and Fish &amp; Game community than I am.Read it here.</p>

<p>Compressed-air energy storage draws GE investment</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mass High Tech reports that West Lebanon, NH-based SustainX has gotten a 
$14.4 million investment from GE to further its work developing ways to store 
energy with compressed air. (Read it here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The investment isn't terribly surprising, since SustainX is a partner in 
GE's Ecomagination Challenge, a high-profile program that GE has used a way to 
find R&amp;D start-ups that might feed into its business. I've written about a 
couple other NH winners:IceCode (developing a quick way to shed built-up ice,

<p>Spotting ticks with Lyme disease ... from space?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a short piece in the latest UNH Magazine, a publication of the 
college, about ways to better predict tick populations so that people can 
better plan for their trips into the wild - or even into the field next door. (
Read it here) One of the methods is:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(to) examine images taken by satellites that indicate forest density and 
patchiness, because ticks are happiest when it's not too shady and not too hot. 
(Researchers), along withApplied GeoSolutions of Newmarket, N.H., are using 
geographical information systems and remote sensing to correlate satellite data 
with ground observations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the researchers semi-jokingly talked about the possibility of 
eventually having daily tick forecasts along with weather and pollen forecasts.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lyme disease is no joking matter, however&nbsp; (although it's also one of 
those vague conditions, like chronic fatigue, to which people attach all sorts 
of wild claims). It is becoming a real problem in northern New England, 
spreading up from the southern parts of the region.Here is the NH Health and 
Human Services page about it.</p>

<p>Pre-'Clovis' humans in North America now seem a certainty</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pretty much my whole adult life, there has been argument about how long 
humans have been in North America. The general idea that I learned is that we 
traipsed over the Bering Strait land bridge about 12,000 years ago, when sea 
levels were low because the Ice Age had sucked up so much water (so to speak), 
and then we spread like crazy. And I mean crazy: It seems likely that humans 
were in New Hampshire as early as 11,000 years ago, just as the glaciers were 
retreating.&nbsp; We must have sprinted the whole way from Alaska.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This scenario is often shorthand labeled &quot;Clovis culture,&quot; named 
for a certain type of stone tools found near Clovis, N.M., and indicative of 
most of the earliest archaeological digs in the content. Most digs, but not 
all: There have always been hints of pre-Clovis people here and there, which is 
why the arguing has gone on. It has also been fertile ground for pseudo-science.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The pre-Clovis hints are now very, very strong, according to a paper in 
Science that finds stone-chipping societies in Texas 15,500 years ago. (
Scientific America article here. Washington post article here.) If it holds up, 
and the coverage I've seen says it will, then at least one major scientific 
argument will have been settled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So what's next? I know: where did humans evolve? Are we &quot;out of Africa
&quot; or &quot;multiregion development&quot;? Mitochondrial DNA gives a real 
leg-up to the former, but the battle isn't over yet!</p>

<p>Even in white New Hampshire, Asian students flourish in the sciences</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the Telegraph newsroom, a couple of us have a tongue-in-cheek contest: 
Any time we get a press release about a school science or math competition, we 
bet whether there will be any obviously white or black or Hispanic names among 
the winners. Amazingly often, there aren't - the background reflected by the 
names will be predominantly south Asian (those mile-long Indian monikers) or 
east Asian (Chinese/Korean/Japanese names that you *know* aren't pronounced the 
way the Latin alphabet spelling makes it seem they are). The rest of the world 
must make do with prizes for English (not spelling, though; that's another 
south Asian stronghold) or stuff like debating. Or sports, of course.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A case in point: this week's education column about a Nashua middle-school 
Mathcounts team that got its second state title in three years. (Read it here) 
Not a lot of ancestors of that cheerful group came over in the Mayflower.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is hardly news - it is well known in college, where white students 
semi-joke that they avoid classes with too many Asian students because that 
means the class will be hard -&nbsp; but it's particularly impressive in New 
Hampshire, which isn't exactly teeming with non-whites.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And it reflects how much culture matters, unless you think that half the 
world's population has some weird I-quantify-well gene. Their families and 
friends admire science and math accomplishment, so they do well in it. It's 
that simple ... or, rather, that difficult, because changing culture is very, 
very tough.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It reminds me of an interview I saw once with (if I recall correctly) 
Itzhak Perlman in which he was asked why so many of the world's great 
violinists are Jewish. Because our fingertips are circumcised! he joked before 
talking about how everybody admired the violin, so they all worked at it.</p>

<p>The state's oldest ISP is reorganizing</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;(NOTE: I misstated the situation earlier, misreading an email 
exchange, so I've rewritten this) MV Communications of Manchester, a small 
independent ISPthat started way back in 1991, making it the oldest in the state 
and one of the longest-running in the country, is reorganizing. However, it is 
not shutting, as I reported earlier. &quot;We're reorganizing and trimming 
down, but we're still open and providing most of our services&quot; said an 
email from a company staffer. I'm on vacation, but hope to have more of a story 
next week.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've written about MV a number of times over the years, most recently in 
2009 when the MV.com domain name turned 21. Here's a snippet from that story:
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thus, on Feb. 3, 1988, or 21 years ago last week, (Mark Mallet of 
Litchfield) registered MV.com, which stood for Merrimack Valley. At about the 
same time, a company called The World was launched in Brookline, Mass., 
becoming the first company to offer dial-up Internet service to the outside 
world - that is, the first Internet service provider.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mallett began to realize that it would cost too much to have full-time 
Internet connection instead of his &quot;dial in every now and then&quot; 
model; if he wanted to make that step, he needed paying customers. The World 
showed him how this could work, and in 1991 he, Marta Greenberg and David Dick 
created MV Communications, New Hampshire's first ISP.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That wasn't so easy, he said, because the online world was still wrestling 
with its proper role. Old-timers may recall the ban on commercial activity, 
which was thought to soil the purity of the Internet. Still, says Mallett, 
having a nearby precedent helped. &quot;All you had to say was say 'The World' 
and they'd say, 'Oh that would be neat to have in New Hampshire' and they'd 
help you out,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Slow but steady progress for our endangered state butterfly</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Associated Press has an article updating the status of the Karner blue 
buttery, an endangered insect that has been the N.H. state butterfly for years. 
The population in about 300 acres of protected woody scrubland near Concord has 
increased from 50 to 2,600, thanks to a gazillion hours of paid and (mostly) 
volunteer labor. Saving species if hard and complicated, and it's still far 
from saved.Read the story here.</p>

<p>I forgot about Earth Hour last night, and I bet you did, too</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Earth Hour, the annual event in which people are supposed to ramp down 
lights for one hour to save electricity and make a gesture toward energy 
efficiency, drew even less attention that usual around here. (It was Saturday 
night at 8:30 p.m.) As I've noted in the past (e.g.,here in 2009), it has never 
produced a noticeable drop in New England electricity usage, even when Boston 
officially participated. (This year, the only official participant I know of is 
Burlington, Vt.) I don't think I'll even ask for power-usage figures this year 
- no point.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The idea of Earth Hour has always seemed reasonable - there's nothing like 
turning off lights to make us realize how much power we use - but somehow it 
never has managed to shake off the aura of empty gesture.</p>

<p>Making dirty water clean can be big business</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Population growth and a warming planet are straining drinking-water 
supplies, so it makes sense that companies whose products can help the 
situation are in a good position. One of those appears to be Koch Membrane 
System of Wilmington, Mass.; the Globe reports that it has just gotten a 
many-millions contract in Brazil for membranes to filter sewer water so it can 
be reused. (The Globe story is here.) It's part of a reverse-osmosis system 
and, according to the story, has a cost and &quot;footprint&quot; advantage 
because it uses a few large membrane systems instead of lots of small ones. The 
hard part was making the large membranes.</p>

<p>Why are the region's insect-eating birds declining?</p>

among other things, that birds which insects on the fly, such as swifts and 
barn swallows, are declining - and nobody knows why. If you check it out, you

<p>Could firefighters battle blazes with electricity?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A study by Harvard researchers, reported at a meeting of the American 
Chemical Society, found that a blast of electricity could stifle flames in 
certain conditions, raising the idea of backpack-wearing firefighters opening 
&quot;doors&quot; in a wall of flame with their magic wands.From the report on 
Eurekalert:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the new study, they connected a powerful electrical amplifier to a 
wand-like probe and used the device to shoot beams of electricity at an open 
flame more than a foot high. Almost instantly, the flame was snuffed out. ... 
The device consisted of a 600-watt amplifier, or about the same power as a 
high-end car stereo system.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But how does it work? Cademartiri acknowledged that the phenomenon is 
complex with several effects occurring simultaneously. Among these effects, it 
appears that carbon particles, or soot, generated in the flame are key for its 
response to electric fields. Soot particles can easily become charged. The 
charged particles respond to the electric field, affecting the stability of 
flames, he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Humidity Control</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the 'features' of Florida are the extremes of heat and humidity, not 
to mention the bugs and lightning during the summer. Some of us, (not me) are 
leaving our RVs here until the next volunteer season of 2012.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was asked to investigate dehumidifiers that would be installed in the 200 
rooms of the Life Enrichment Center. One option to control humidity and 
decrease the mold and fungus is to run the air conditioners for three quarters 
of the year. The energy costs would be prohibitive and wear and tear on the 
equipment precludes us from doing that. Dehumidifiers are less expensive to 
install and electrical costs are also reduced. BUT, (there's always a but) the 
size of the equipment for these small rooms isn't really an option.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are two main ways of creating a cold plate to condense moisture out 
of the air. One that we are most familiar with is the standard compressor, 
coils and fan. These work very well and are used by the millions all over the 
world. I have one in my basement that does wonders for the workshop.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The other option is a solid state device known as a peltier junction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The advantages of this type of dehumidifier are, very quiet operation, 
usually just a computer fan to move the air across the cold junction. For the 
size rooms or RVs we have, a very small unit is sufficient.&nbsp;They are also 
energy efficient, drawing about as much as a 75 watt incandescent lamp as 
opposed to 300 watts or more for compressor units. The cost of equipment is 
low, $90 for one sized to our needs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;http://www.air-n-water.com/reviews/eva-dry/edv-2200</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This little unit isn't nearly big enough to use at home, but for a single 
room, closet or closed up RV, it seems to be the right choice. I've had to 
modify the tank, drilling, tapping and adding a pipe nipple and tubing for 
continuous draining into the sink. I'll be curious to check in next year to see 
if I've made the right choice or should have gone with something bigger.</p>

<p>Icy water, lots of snow cut hydro, solar power output</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PSNH says the ice Merrimack River reduced flow through its 16-megawatt 
hydropower dam at Manchester, while January's heavy snows blocked the 
51-kilowatt solar farm atop the company HQ in that city, resulting in n 8 
percent drop in hydropower and &quot;mid-January through mid-February being the 
slowest month yet for output from the 2-year-old Energy Park PV system.&quot;

<p>What exposes you to more radiation: A nuke plant or a coal-fired plant?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a calculator for estimating your 
daily exposure to radiation. It raises your risk by varous amounts of<em>mrem
</em> (thousands of a rem) received annually depending on factors such as your 
altitude above sea level, whether you wear a luminous wrist watch, whether you 
have porcelain crowns, etc. The most interesting choices, however, are these 
two:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* Live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant (pressurized water reactor) 
(0.0009 mrem)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* Live within 50 miles of a coal-fired electrical utility plant (0.03 mrem)
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In other words, NRC says living near a coal-fired power plant, such as 
Merrimack Valley Station in Bow, N.H., exposes you to 30 times as much 
radiation as living near a pressurized water nuclear plant such as Seabrook 
Station on the N.H. seacoast. (That's assuming the nuclear plant is operating 
properly, of course.) Who would have guessed?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Both of these, by the way, are tiny, tiny amounts. Just living in a 
non-critical part of the U.S. exposes you to 2 mrem each year, and the NRC says 
anything less than 100 mrem of annual exposure is not worth considering.</p>

<p>UNH news: Energy 'ribbon' in heliosphere due to galactic magnetic field 
(maybe)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From UNH News Service: In a paper to be published in the April 10 issue of 
The Astrophysical Journal, scientists on NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer 
(IBEX) mission, including lead author Nathan Schwadron and others from the 
University of New Hampshire, isolate and resolve the mysterious 
&quot;ribbon&quot; of energy and particles the spacecraft discovered in the 
heliosphere &acirc;&#128;&#147; the huge bubble that surrounds our solar system 
and protects us from galactic cosmic rays. (Article can be read here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The finding, which overturns 40 years of theory, provides insight into the 
fundamental structure of the heliosphere, which in turn helps scientists 
understand similar structures or &quot;astrospheres&quot; that surround other 
star systems throughout the cosmos.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ribbon of energy was captured using ultra-high sensitive cameras that 
image energetic neutral atoms (instead of photons of light) to create maps of 
the boundary region between our solar system and the rest of our galaxy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Notes Schwadron, an associate professor at UNH's Institute for the Study of 
Earth, Oceans, and Space and department of physics, &quot;Isolating and 
separating the ribbon from the IBEX maps was like pulling the drapes from our 
window to discover the landscape at the edge of the solar system.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of the singular images the IBEX mission has been able to achieve, lead 
scientist David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) says, 
&quot;These maps are very rich scientifically and are critical in helping 
scientists understand how our space environment is controlled by the galactic 
medium. They provide the first images of our solar system's boundaries, which 
control the access to potentially harmful galactic cosmic rays as well as all 
other matter from deep space.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The most energetic galactic cosmic rays penetrate even the powerful 
magnetic fields closest to Earth and eventually collide and interact with 
Earth's atmosphere. The direct or indirect effects of these cosmic rays on the 
Earth system, including our biosphere, remain poorly understood and are often 
highly controversial.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The IBEX team is using the maps to learn how the heliosphere is shaped and 
what its physical properties are. This detailed information about our solar 
system's boundaries will allow scientists to better understand how galactic 
cosmic rays evolve in our space environment, which in turn will provide 
fundamental information about the radiation environment on Earth and its 
implications on the evolution of life.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The IBEX scientists analyzed data from the mission's first year of 
observations and, after developing an effective separation method, were able to 
isolate and resolve the unanticipated energetic ribbon feature. The ribbon 
appears to be wrapped like a belt on top of the globally distributed emissions 
of the broader sky, and by separating it from the background emissions 
scientists can now see what's underneath the ribbon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Says Schwadron, &quot;There are many theories about how the ribbon is 
created, and we don't understand exactly what we're seeing but it seems to be 
telling us something about how the local galactic magnetic field interacts with 
the heliosphere.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Additional evidence for that interaction was the discovery of a 
&quot;tail&quot; of emissions in the underlying boundary landscape, which is 
apparently deflected in the direction of the galactic magnetic field as the 
ribbon seems to indicate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;This galactic magnetic field may be a missing key to understanding 
how the heliosphere protects the solar system from galactic cosmic rays,&quot; 
says Schwadron.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Also seen in the maps is the expected feature of the &quot;nose&quot; of 
the heliosphere. The nose represents the direction in which the solar system 
moves through the local part of the galaxy nearest to our Sun and that 
Schwadron compares to the &quot;bow wave in front of a ship, which shows us how 
our motion through the galaxy compresses and deflects the material of the local 
galactic medium around our heliosphere.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The IBEX maps differ so radically from what was expected prior to the 
mission that the scientists have been struggling to untangle the vast amount of 
information the maps contain. The team notes that getting emissions from the 
nose of the heliosphere has been an important &quot;lamp post&quot; towards 
understanding how the global heliosphere is controlled by the interaction of 
the Sun with the local galactic medium.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Says McComas, &quot;Prior to IBEX, most scientists believed that the global 
boundaries of our solar system were controlled mainly by the motion of our 
solar system through the galaxy and the solar wind, an extremely fast flow of 
electrically charged matter that flows out from the Sun. The IBEX maps reveal 
the galactic magnetic field is also a critical part of the Sun's interaction 
with the galaxy.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The mission launched October 19, 2008 and carries two ultra-high 
sensitivity cameras containing important components designed and built at UNH. 
In addition, the mission's Science Operations Center is headquartered at UNH.

<p>The Globe has a story about a Massachusetts inventor who claims he has made 
a gizmo that sprays heating oil as a mist for burning, which greatly increases 
the efficiency of the burn. The story is reasonably cautious, with some caveats 
from experts, but it still sounds interesting, since northern New England is (I 
believe) the region that is most dependent on heating oil.</p>

<p>Bug-eating bats mean billions for agriculture, but not so much here</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A Boston University bat expert has made an informed back-of-envelope 
estimate of the value of insect-eating bats to American agriculture. His 
number: At least $3 billion, maybe 15 times as much. He argue, quite 
reasonably, that this means we should be doing more to fight white nose 
syndrome as it moves west, devastating entire populations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As the map on the Wired article page shows (check it out here), bats' 
effect on New England agriculture is pretty limited. Only the desert southwest 
has an equally small estimated effect.</p>

<p>We owe it to our readers to present everybody's ideas equally and not to 
ignore or discredit theories simply because they lack scientifically credible 
arguments or facts. Nor should we succumb to the easy mistake of thinking that 
scientists understand their fields better than, say, U.S. senators or 
best-selling novelists do. Indeed, if politicians or special-interest groups 
say things that seem untrue or misleading, our duty as journalists is to quote 
them without comment or contradiction. To do otherwise would be elitist and 
therefore wrong.</p>

<p>veral lines of research now indicate thata 3-foot global rise by 2100 is a 
plausible scenario, though some scientists forecast a smaller rise. In other 
words, what was once a problem for our great great-grandchildren is one our 
children could confront. And it is possible the news could be even worse in the 
Northeast. Studies showthat changes in ocean circulationdriven by warming 
waters could raise sea levels an additional foot or more along New England 
shores by the end of the century.</p>

<p>BU student challenges $67,500 fine for music file sharing</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The case of Boston University graduate student Joel Tenenbaum, who shared 
(&quot;stole&quot;, if you prefer) 30 songs online and was sued by the 
recording industry, has made it to the federal appeal level. It's the first 
time this has happened, says the Globe (in this article). Arguments were made 
Monday and the appeal of a $67,500 fine taken under advisement.</p>

<p>Teaching the value of vaccines, through a board game</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When Mary Flanagan was hired at Dartmouth as their first person to occupy 
their chair in Digital Humanities, I was intrigued enough to write a column in 
which she advocated the role of games and gaming in education. And here's just 
the sort of thing she talked about: A board game she helped develop that 
demonstrates the damage that can be done when people skip vaccines: 
&quot;Players really experience how things get out of control very quickly with 
an unvaccinated population.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the school's own story about it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I hope to do my own story, too, but Darmouth did an excellent job without 
me (darn them).</p>

<p>Headline I hope is true: &quot;Accidental Find May Lead to Cure for 
Baldness&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nothing local I can find this morning, so let the hairline-challenged among 
us read this story and dream:<br>
Accidental Find May Lead to a Cure For 
Baldness</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UCLA scientists were studying the effect of a hormone known as 
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on stress, and say the balding mile got 
hairy again.</p>

<p>A cryptozoology (Bigfoot, etc.) museum in Maine - who knew?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Boston Globe visited the Cryptozoology Museum in Portland, Maine, that 
seems to exist somewhere between true believer land and skeptic city, dealing 
with the coelacanth as well as the yeti.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The trick is to tell the serious from the hoax, and (the owner) believes 
his background in social work helps. &quot;I analyze the people involved in 
sightings,'' he admits. &quot;It's all part of the investigation.''</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the story. Here's the website of the museum.</p>

<p>Tabletop Geometry</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm often amused by the assumptions people make when they don't poke their 
heads up to see the overall picture.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My volunteer job here at the Life Enrichment Center is hospitality host in 
the cafeteria. The setup is similar to thousands of cafeterias all over the 
world where food is served on plates placed on standard fiberglas trays. They 
look like a rectangle with two corners cut off to make a six sided tray. Our 
tables are round seating six to ten people.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I watch people arranging the trays as they sit down. Some large percentage 
place the trays as they should with the broad end matching the outer 
circumference of the table. Some though, place the narrow end facing them, 
thinking perhaps that they are making more room for others at the table. I've 
gently pointed out the advantages of broad end out and then met with amazed 
looks as the obvious becomes clear. It's such a simple concept. People who are 
40 to 80 years old should have recognized and applied the thinking process 
sometimes in their life.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Perhaps its too trivial. What difference does it really make? Some small 
inconvenience to others only lasts for the time it takes for that one meal and 
no one is really paying attention. An outside observer like me is bothered by 
this lapse in logic only because I see it so often. Someone working in crowd 
control like an airport or major entertainment center must have to put with a 
lot of this type of unconcious behavior. I wonder how often I've done the same 
activity just because I didn't see the big picture.</p>

<p>Should online retailers have to pay state sales tax?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For years there has been a debate about whether the Amazon.coms of the 
world should pay state sales tax. Depending on your point of view, it's either 
only fair because bricks-and-mortar companies pay it, or it's just another 
government money grab because online sales entities don't use government 
services the way traditional retailers do.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Massachusetts is one of many states bringing up the issue again (as the 
Globe reports here), spurred in part of financial problems.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I think that bricks-and-mortar retailers provide enough indirect benefits 
to the community - notably, local jobs - that they shouldn't be penalized. In 
other words, yes, sales tax should apply to online sales. It wouldn't affect us 
in New Hampshire, of course.</p>

<p>A trebuchet-building contest - and it's at an armory museum</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thanks to the success of Yankee Siege, the enormous trebuchet that 
dominated the world PunkinChunkin contest for five years, New Hampshire has a 
special relationship with these siege engines of yore. (Trebuchets throw stuff 
with an arm powered by a counter-weight, as compared to a catapult, which uses 
torsion, or a ballista, which uses bow-like springs. They're the mechanically 
simplist, and thus usually the largest, of pre-gunpowder weapons of mass 
destruction.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Higgins Armory Museum in Worcester, Mass., a cool little museum or 
armor and weaponry, is giving the state a chance to show off its trebuchet 
chops on April 30 with a contest cleverly called Siege the Day. They want folks 
build a trebuchet of wood or PVC pipe, on a frame no bigger than 6-by-8-by-6 
feet, and bring them to the museum for a test that involves six attempts 
throwing a one-pound bag of beans at targets 75 feet and 100 feet away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the instructions: &quot;The sling, release mechanism and sling ropes 
are left to the design of the teams.&nbsp; No mechanical devices, such as, but 
not limited to springs hydraulic rams, shock cords, or air cylinders.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sounds like fun. It's free to enter and free to watch. More instructions 
are here. Contact Devon Kurtz, dkurtz@higgins.org, with any questions.</p>

<p>50th anniversary of Gagarin's flight coming up</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>REMINDER: THE DWC celebration is tonight.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Next Tuesday, April 12, is the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight - 
humanity's first tiptoe into space, if you will. Various events are being held 
around the world, part of a loosely organized thingamajig calledYuri's Night.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The only NH celebration I can find is in Nashua, where aeronautics and 
aviation students will be celebrating at Daniel Webster College as a sort of 
spinoff of the annual student conference for theAmerican Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics, taking place Friday and Saturday in Nashua. 
(Here'sthe site for that conference, which is co-sponsored by the student 
chapters at DWC and UMass-Lowell; it features some 22 presentations about 
student research and 5 talks by various professionals.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As far as Yuri's Night goes, on Friday at DWC the Gargarin fans will have a 
meal, varous space-related activities like a &quot;lunar lander&quot; egg drop, 
and a presentation from Team Goddard at WPI, which designed a permanent lunar 
base (HTML version of their presentation here). There will be, alas, no raffles 
for low-Earth-orbit trips, but it sounds pretty cool.</p>

<p>Maine's wireless smart power meters move ahead, despite silly fears</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Maine Public Utilities Commission says Central Maine Power can go ahead 
with its plan to place wireless meters in customer homes, an important first 
step to creating time-of-day pricing and other aspects of a less wasteful 
electricity grid, even though a few people have convinced themselves that the 
signals are somehow harmful to their health.Here's the Press-Herald story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This isn't the end of the silly kerfuffle, however. The Maine legislature 
is still considering bills prodded by objections, including one that would let 
people opt out of the plan.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A single chart shows the staggering amount of energy we waste</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you want a poke-in-the-eye illustration of how much energy is wasted in 
the U.S., check out the superb illustration put together by Lawrence Livermore 
labs. It's a flow chart for energy use that demonstrates not only how little is 
produced by renewable resources (coal, oil and natural gas dwarf everything 
else)&nbsp; but also how much of it is wasted: 54.6 quads is labelled 
&quot;rejected energy&quot; (e.g., waste heat from power plants) while only 40 
quads is &quot;energy services&quot; (e.g., gasoline burned by your car).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I spotted it via this Grist article.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Check it out, and shake your head in dismay. Then go home and put more 
insulation in your attic.</p>

<p>'Crazy breathing' and mystery footsteps - why, it must be ghosts!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not easy filling all those cable channels on TV, which explains why 
&quot;ghost hunter&quot; shows exist, because no rational human being could be 
entertained or enthralled by people waving around electronics meters and 
pretending that some of the numbers they encounter mean something about ghosts, 
or something like that.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Apparently that assessment is wrong, however: At least 50 people liked 
watching some of these goofballs tramping around Fort Knox in Maine, orso 
reports the Bangor Daily News.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You'll be astonished to learn that these publicity hounds didn't find any 
evidence of ghosts, but heard spooky footsteps and &quot;crazy breathing.&quot; 
Vast wasteland, anybody?</p>

<p>Raising tropical fish from eggs - in Maine?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We had tropical fish when I was a kid, so I can't get on too much of a high 
horse about the hobby, but it is definitely a bad thing from the point of view 
of the world's ecology. Virtually all the fish in fish stores and tanks are 
caught in the wild, which means our pet-owning whims can damage populations - 
as if ocean acidification, reef bleaching and ocean warming isn't bad enough.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The only reasonable hope is to grow the fish from eggs in captivity. The 
Portland Press-Herald has a story about a company doing that - in Maine, of all 
places. (Read it here) They are raising clownfish (as in &quot;Finding 
Nemo&quot;) and dottybacks, although after several years they're still having 
issues, ranging from figuring out the best way to feed them, to finding ways to 
heat water without spending a fortune.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story says why this is a good idea:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ninety-five percent of the 1,500 saltwater tropical fish species sold for 
use in home aquariums are collected in the wild from coral reefs in the Pacific 
Ocean, such as those off the Philippines and Indonesia. They are harvested by 
divers who use dynamite or squirt a poisonous solution to stun the fish, 
killing already fragile coral and other non-target organisms. The mortality 
rate among wild-caught fish is 80 to 90 percent even before they land in the 
pet store, and about 50 to 60 percent of the initial survivors after that.</p>

<p>Long-distance calls over the Internet; like magic, but vaguely worrisome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My daughter is in Africa at the moment. We called her via AT&amp;T and it 
cost $150 - gulp! So we've set up a Google Voice account so we can talk to her 
cell-phone for about 1/20th as much. Talk about a disruptive technology.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I must admit that part of me is slightly worried about voice-over-Internet 
from a business point of view - I'm concerned it is undermining the income 
which allowed a worldwide phone system (lines, switches, maintenance and 
installation staff) to be created in the first place. Obviously there is a lot 
of waste and unnecessary expense and monopoly-enabled froth in 
telecommunications, but is the consumer cost really 95% unnecessary? That 
doesn't seem plausible, which implies that a switch to this form of calling 
will start eating the seed corn of the entire structure, leading to weakness 
and failure down the road.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Or maybe not. Parts of Africa are demonstrating how wireless phones are 
leapfrogging the system that we built in the western world, bringing voice and 
data to remote places, and to poor people in cities, a zillion times faster 
than the traditional wires-on-poles route. So maybe a slow collapse of the 
system that has worked so brilliantly for 100 years would be no big deal.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The parallels to my industry - newspapers are dying; is that good or bad 
for journalism and democracy? - are obvious.</p>

<p>Save the timber rattlesnake! (A rallying cry that will take some massaging)
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The only poisonous snake in Northern New England is the timber rattlesnake, 
which despite the fearsome-sounding name is a shy reptile. Its New Hampshire 
population is so small that officials won't say where the state's only group 
lives, for fear that the news would draw exotic-pet fanciers and/or haters, 
with bad results.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vermont's population is also tiny, so small that, as the Burlington Free 
Press reported recently,conservation and state groups have launched a study to 
determine their numbers and methods to preserve them. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Until 1971, the state paid a bounty for people to kill the snakes. In an 
extreme turnabout of attitude, 16 years later Vermont added timber rattlers to 
the state endangered-species list and made it illegal to kill or harass 
them.&nbsp; Although the snakes might once have been found as far north as 
Milton in the Champlain Valley, they now are con</p> 
<p>fined to a warm pocket of Rutland County where rocky ledges provide denning 
and basking sites.</p>

<p>50 years of manned space flight: It's Yuri's Night</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong> Wired.com has a cool article about doctored 
photos from the Soviet space era, in which various people were airbrushed out 
of photos because they misbehaved, died, or otherwise ran afoul of authorities.
Read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A half-century ago, the Soviets launched Yuri Gargarin into orbit, freaking 
out the U.S. and launching the space race for real. There's a worldwide 
celebration (Yuri's Night), considerable what-iffing (What if the US had done 
it first?) and plenty of where-do-we-go-from-here (&quot;Forget Space Flight: 
It's Just a Dream&quot;)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the 50th anniversary of Sputnik I interviewed a bunch of people who 
remembered where they were when that news broke, including this tidbit from a 
Russian I met in Siberia, a Russian food store on Main Street in Nashua:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He said he was in his early 20s in Moscow when the news broke, but I can't 
really quote him because he decided to hide his name. &quot;You can use a 
pseudonym,&quot; he suggested, in what appears to be some leftover paranoia 
from a Soviet childhood despite decades living in the U.S. He told me the 
launch was as big a surprise to Muscovites as it was to Americans, because the 
Soviets had withheld all news of their launch attempts until they had a success 
to report. Exploding rockets never showed up on the front page of Pravda, it 
seems. By the time the Apollo program made it clear the Soviets were being 
outdone, he added, news of the space race had disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p>Using the Infinite Corridor and toilet paper, students break paper-folding 
record</p>

<p>From a story in Boston.com:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Using more than two miles of toilet tissue and one infinite corridor at 
MIT, a group from St. Mark's School claim to have wiped out the world record 
for folding paper Sunday. The group of 15 students and teacher James Tanton 
from the boarding school in Southborough claim to have folded 13,000 feet of 
toilet paper in half 13 times (with each fold in the same direction), which 
would break the record of 12 times set in 2002.</p>

<p>The American flag and laundry are not the same thing, thinks NH legislature
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last year the New Hampshire legislature declined to pass bills that would 
prevent homeowners associations from banning outdoor laundry - a proposal 
pushed byProject Laundry List, which argues that outdated concern about 
aesthetics fprces people to use energy-hogging clothes dryers when it isn't 
necessary. The legislators said they didn't want to interfere with private 
contracts signed by homeowners and associations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When it comes to American flags, however, it might be different. After a 
woman complained that her condo association wouldn't let her fly a flag, it 
seems likely that the House and Senate will pass a bill saying that nobody can 
prevent you from flying a flag around your home, although &quot;reasonable 
restrictions regarding the size of the flag or the manner in which the flag is 
displayed may be adopted and enforced.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the Union-Leader article about the bill.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I suspect some Project Laundry List folks will find this distinction 
hypocritical, but I also suspect that most people would be comfortable with it.

<p>Heating with wood - something New England needs to do more of</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The annual Heating with Wood conference starts today in Manchester. It's an 
industry fair, with folks peddling everything from umpty-son woodchip silos to 
the machines that wrap plastic around pallet-loads of wood pellets. I wrote an 
advance, with photos of the new wood-fired boiler heating system at Mascenic 
High School, for the Telegraph:You can peruse it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the website for the conference.</p>

<p>My column this coming Monday quantifies how much gas you can save by going 
slower on the highway (here'sa quickie video promo to whet your appetite, or 
perhaps make you contribute to my Buy Dave A Toupee fund). To show that I'm not 
a complete killjoy, I'm now going to link to a Burlington Free Press story 
about a Vermont native who just broke 300 mph on the Bonneville Salt Flats.(

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A quote from the driver, comparing it to rules-laden operations like 
NASCAR: &quot;You can build and you can fabricate your own design. That's what 
really appealed to me about Bonneville, that and the fact that the landscape is 
very foreign.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story says he hit 200 mph in his handmade machine, open wheel and open 
cockpit, but hitting 300 required closing it up to reduce drag</p>

<p>How do you calculate the value of the stuff Smaug the dragon is sleeping on?
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As Tolkein fans know, Smaug the dragon of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; fame slept 
on a lot of gold and diamonds before Bilbo did his burglarizing best.&nbsp; 
Forbes magazine decided to calculate exactly how much that stuff was worth, in 
order to place Smaug in their annual list of 15 richest fictional characters. 
(Smaug was No. 7, behind Scrooge McDuck and Jed Clampett, but ahead of Mr. 
Monopoly and C. Montgomery Burns, among others.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The writer included a very amusing discussion of how he arrived at the 
monetary calculation of Smaug's horde, including the estimate that the dragon's 
breast was covered with 38,900 arrow-deflecting diamonds.You can read it here.

<p>Hybrid formula racing returns to N.H., thanks to Dartmouth</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 5th annual Formula Hybrid Competition is May 1-4 at New Hampshire 
International Speedway, with 33 college/industry teams from around the world. 
The contest is based on the long-running Formula SAE (Society of Automotive 
Engineers) in which students build scaled-down races and compete for design, 
acceleration, handling, and endurance. The difference with this one is the 
hybrid aspect, which complicates things enormously. (I covered the first year, 
and most of the entries couldn't even run that year.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is the geekiest of bending-metal geek fests: Car nuts crossed with 
people who think a good argument involves capacitors vs. lithium-ion batteries.

<p>Ig Nobel star (a Nobel laureate, too) dies at age 91</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you've ever attended (at Harvard), listened to (on NPR's Science Friday) 
or seen (online) the annual Ig Nobel award show, you've seen William Lipscomb, 
who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1976. His clarinet playing, string bow 
tie and willingness to don funny hats made him the classic 
wicked-smart-guy-who-liked-poking-fun-at-himself persona that the Igs celebrate 
to the hilt.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How smart was he? Three of his doctoral students also won Nobel prizes - 
that's saying something.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Alas, Lipscomb has died, although since he reached 91 we should celebrate a

<p>Here isthe NY Times obituary, which in a bit of journalistic misjudgement 
doesn't mention the IgNobels until the end. But it does nicely summarize his 
award-winning work: &quot;Dr. Lipscomb's research involved developing X-ray 
diffraction techniques, usually used as a tool in physics, that allowed him to 
map the connection of the atoms in an important but puzzling group of compounds 
called boron hydrides.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowing down from 70 to 60 mph saves ... wow, 20% in mpg!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today, with accompanying video (<em>oh, what a Brave 
New World we newspaperman are floundering in!</em>) talks about a small test I 
did on the local freeway, driving in cruise control at 60 mph and then 70 mph 
to quantify the difference in gas mileage. It was pretty surprising: 20 
percent. I have an old hybrid, and this was a small sample, so Your Mileage May 
Vary, quite literally.</p>

<p>PSNH says underground/underwater wouldn't work for huge hydropower line</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There has been much debate in New Hampshire about the plan by PSNH's parent 
company and HydroQuebec to run a 1,200-megawatt DC power line down through the 
state, to bring electricity from huge dams in Quebec to Boston and other parts 
of New England. There is much opposition to big, ugly power lines (these DC 
towers are enormous; we have a set here in southern NH) in the North Country.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One idea is to run it down the length of the Connecticut River - but PSNH 
says the river is too shallow for that to work.The Union-Leader has a story here
.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are also hopes that they lines might be buried, but costs mean that 
idea is &quot;too fanciful ... to require detailed analysis,&quot; claims the 
utility.</p>

<p>IRS says e-filing of tax returns ends Apr. 15 rush at post offices</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the Union-Leader today:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>According to the IRS, 101 million e-filed returns were received by Monday 
morning &acirc;&#128;&#148; an 8.8 percent increase from last year. It was the 
first time that more than 100 million had filed electronically in any given 
year since the e-file program went national in 1990, the IRS said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In fact, most post offices no longer extend hours to accommodate the rush 
of procrastinators who used to pack in at the very last minute on Tax Day, 
which was moved from April 15 to April 18 because Emancipation Day, celebrated 
in Washington, D.C., fell on Friday.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is, of course, not good news for the cash-strapped postal service. At 
least they still have Netflix envelopes to deliver!</p>

<p>A normal 'ice-out' this year</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last year, Lake Winipesaukee had the earliest &quot;ice-out&quot; on record 
- by several days, in fact. It was a real outlier, or (shudder) a sign of 
warmer things to come. This year was more normal, reports the Union-Leader (
read it here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This was a fabulous winter for ice - it was nice and cold but snow-free 
before Christmas, so we did more pond skating, and on lovely flat, slick ice, 
than I ever have.</p>

<p>Verizon finds a whole lot less - or maybe a little more - data theft loss
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thanks to the Telegraph copy desk, I was alerted to an interesting article 
on threatpost.com about head-scratchingly odd data released by Verizon, which 
says Verizon found &quot;a stunning 97% drop in the number of lost records, 
even as the number of reported breaches rose precipitously.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maybe this means that Verizon is better at protecting its data. Maybe it 
means ways of measuring data loss is flawed and the bad guys have found 
invisible ways to be bad. Maybe it means ... er, something else.</p>

<p>Shop Radiant Heating</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My shop has in-floor radiant heating. It's a massive slab, thicker than 
most floors so the thermal properties cause quite a lag when I'm going to be 
working on my projects. I have some heavy metal working machines and I didn't 
want any floor cracks, especially with the heating tubing embedded in the 
concrete. A wall mounted thermostat, on 3/8&quot; plywood would again cause a 
lag in response.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My 'fix' is to use an ordinary spring-wound timer to run the furnace for 
some period of time to give me the amount of heating I want. Since I know what 
the outside temperature will be from the weather forecast and I know what the 
starting temperature will be, I can estimate how much heat will be required to 
be comfortable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>First thing in the morning, if I know I'll be spending some happy hours in 
the shop, I'll go down and set the timer for 1 to 3 hours of heating. By the 
time I'm ready to go to work, the shop is up to 65 degrees or so, comfortable 
with heat coming from the floor. My feet are warm, so I'm warm enough.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is a similar method used by some heating systems called an 'Outdoor 
Reset Control'. This control has an outside temperature sensor that modifies 
the furnace response to a call for heating. The colder the outside is, the 
sooner the furnace will turn on. The result is a more even and comfortable home 
environment for the occupants. I'm doing the same thing but manually judging 
what I'll need. It works well and has for the past many years. Another 
advantage is that when I'm not home, the furnace zone for the shop is 
absolutely off. Most thermostats only go down to about 50 degrees.</p>

<p>Ash Tree Treasure</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I just had four Ash trees taken down on the street in front of the house. 
The biggest was 21&quot; in diameter and on counting the rings, was 88 years 
old. So far, I've taken 5 truckload of firewood over to the temporary woodpile 
after cutting to length and splitting in place. Those big 16&quot; long 
cylinders are heavy! One of the trees has in internal dark brown discoloration 
inside, centered on the middle and looking like a multi-lobbed starfish. I've 
tried to find out what this is, but it's not Ash decline or caused by the 
dreaded Ash Emerald Borer beetle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Whatever it is, it affects the strength of the wood, noticeable when I'm 
running the power splitter. To the good, turning bowls of this affected wood 
reveals a beautiful pattern, contrasting with the often plain appearance of Ash.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Counting the rings, it is obvious that the trees were stressed some years. 
Either from drought or shading from other trees, there would be a period of 5 
or more years when the growth rings were very close together. Other years, the 
growth rings might be &frac14;&quot; in width indicating good weather 
conditions. If I was a little more ambitious, I could match ring width to 
historical weather. This is how archaeologists can trace weather patterns back 
through centuries, taking timber from old buildings and other places and 
building a weather history going back centuries.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've seen discs of Redwood and Joshua trees in museums with ID tags going 
back before the birth of Christ. Those large slices of history are invaluable 
to determine if our present weather patterns are a normal deviation lasting 
just a few years or is indicative of a long term slide toward global warming. 
Either way, more information is a good thing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Anyway, my home heating via wood stove is solved for the next three years 
or so. I still have firewood left over from the big ice storm a couple of years 
back. My biggest problem now is where to put this bulky and heavy fuel.</p>

<p>The Oil Drum</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The present rise in oil and gasoline prices are being blamed on everything 
from the North African political changes to speculators to greed of the oil 
companies. There are lots of opinions about why this is happening. Any search 
of the internet or watching cable news will allow you to find just about any 
version of the truth. Whatever your political slant, you can find a source that 
will reinforce your view of the world.&nbsp; Accurate information is hard to 
come by.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is one internet blog that seems to have the most up-to-date and 
accurate information. The Oil Drum has contributors who work within and outside 
the energy industry. All their postings are archived so that if you wish, you 
can trace the history of energy production. You can see how the mix, including 
alternative sources will figure in the future of how we will heat our homes and 
power our cars.</p>

<p>Who should have access to doctors' prescription data?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vermont is having a legal battle over who can control information about 
prescriptions - pharmaceutical companies or physicians. (We're talking about 
data that, in theory, has individual patient information removed, although as 
has been determinedin this surprising/scary test, you can tease out people from 
&quot;anonymized&quot; data with suprising ease.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the Gannett storyin the Burlington Free-Press: &quot;Vermont's law, 
similar to measures in Maine and New Hampshire, prohibits pharmacies from 
selling prescription information for drug marketing without a physician's 
consent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit declared the law an 
unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech. A separate U.S. appeals 
court upheld the similar New Hampshire law.&quot; The companies say having the 
data allows them to provide better information about drugs to doctors, while 
others say it just lets them ramp up marketing regardless of health benefits. (

<p>Seabrook nuclear plant expects the ocean will be 1.5 feet higher by 2050</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The tsunami in Japan startled a lot of us with a demonstration of how 
freaking powerful the ocean can be. The videos of the waves didn't look as 
scary or last as movie tsunamis do, but the water just kept coming and coming 
and coming, destroying anything and everything.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One side effect has been that the idea of a rising sea due to climate 
change has become much, much more frightening.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's particularly frightening to nuclear power plants on the coast (as are 
most of them, to take advantage of the ocean for cooling). Seabrook Station, 
New Hampshire's only nuclear power plant, is taking a look at what it needs to 
do to lessen the risk - NHPR has a good report: &quot;With funds from the New 
Hampshire DES, the Rockingham Planning Commission conducted a study two years 
ago in Seabrook. That study recommended Seabrook plan for a 3 to 5 feet mean 
sea level rise by the year 2100, and at least 1.5 feet by mid-century.&quot;</p>

<p>Learning while commuting isn't so easy</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In my years of doing a 40-minute commute, I've gotten tired of radio and my 
iPod, so I sometimes try thoseGreat Courses on CDs, taken from the local 
library. It seems like an obvious winner: Fill empty time with something that 
will keep my neurons from fading away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have found, however, that for whatever reason, I can't learn truly new 
stuff while driving. I can fill gaps in existing knowledge as long as they're 
not very big gaps, but that's about it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In other words, I can only listen to lectures to topics I already know alot 
about: the history (not musical theory) of jazz, their science topics 
(dinosaurs, classical physics, etc., none of which go very deep), or &quot;The 
History of the Cold War,&quot; which I just finished. Hey, I lived through that 
history, of course I know it!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the other hand, my days with &quot;The Philosophy of Thomas 
Aquinas&quot; were a dud. I zoned out of half of it, suddenly realized that an 
entire track had gone by and I had no idea what the lecturer said. My knowledge 
of Aquinas' philosophy consisted of a few sentences before I began, and the 
same few sentences now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So I guess I won't try to get my MBA while commuting, after all ...</p>

<p>Fanboy alert: Steven Chu is coming to NH! Woo-hoo!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Energy Secretary Steven Chu, the only science Nobel laureate ever to sit in 
the presidential Cabinet, is coming to New Hampshire on Thursday. He and the 
governor will say who is getting money from UNH'sGreen Launching Pad 
startup-funding program.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The tentative schedule is that he'll be at EnerTracin Hudson, a 
remote-sensing firm that is building a niche in energy reduction, at 11:30 a.m. 
(Hmmm ... will I be drummed out of the New Hampshire Press Association if I ask 
for his autograph?) Later, he'll go to an energy symposium at Dartmouth (
details here).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Incidentally, this description from Chu's Nobel autobiography will make any 
researcher quiver with envy. This is how science is supposed to be:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I joined Bell Laboratories in the fall of 1978. I was one of roughly two 
dozen brash, young scientists that were hired within a two year period. We felt 
like the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot;, with no obligation to do anything except the 
research we loved best. The joy and excitement of doing science permeated the 
halls. The cramped labs and office cubicles forced us to interact with each 
other and follow each others' progress. The animated discussions were common 
during and after seminars and at lunch and continued on the tennis courts and 
at parties.&nbsp; ... Bell Labs management supplied us with funding, shielded 
us from extraneous bureaucracy, and urged us not to be satisfied with doing 
merely &quot;good science.&quot; My department head, Peter Eisenberger, told me 
to spend my first six months in the library and talk to people before deciding 
what to do.</p>

<p>Harbor seal survey hits the coast in Maine, Cape Cod</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Seals have become a problem on parts of the west coast, congregating to the 
point that they annoy boaters and/or do harm to the local fish population, but 
we don't seem to have that issue in the Northeast. But there's a lot we don't 
know about the region's seals - hence a new survey of seals in Maine and Cape 
Cod that's going to take place during the pup-raising period of May and June. 
Animals will be tagged, weighed, and observed, as compared to annual counts 
made from the air, which constitute the bulk of our current knowledge.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The work is being overseen by NOAA's Woods Hole Laboratory. From a press 
release: &quot;We don't know how many harbor seals there are in New England 
because most seal surveys focus on one specific area or location, but we do 
know that local populations have grown in size during the last few decades, and 
have changed in many ways, especially in southern New England and Nantucket 
Sound. ... The 2011 seal survey is also part of a larger, multi-year survey of 
marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds along the entire U.S. East Coast which 
the NEFSC is leading on behalf of four federal agencies.</p>

<p>New England will have enough electricity this summer</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ISO-New England, the organization that oversees New England's power grid, 
says we will have enough electricity generation this summer even if we get 
another record-breaking heat wave, as in 2010.From the release:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Following a 2010 summer that broke several records, 2011 demand is 
predicted to peak at 27,550 megawatts (MW) under normal summer weather 
conditions of about 90 degrees Fahrenheit&acirc;&#128;&#148;slightly higher 
than last year's actual peak of 27,102 MW. If New England were to experience 
extreme weather conditions, such as an extended heat wave of about 95 degrees, 
peak consumption could rise to 29,695 MW. New England's total capacity is 
32,980 MW.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The all-time record for peak demand in New England was set on August 2, 
2006, when consumer demand reached 28,130 MW. One megawatt of electricity can 
power approximately 1,000 homes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vermont Yankee produces about 620 MW, so even if it shuts down abruptly 
we've got enough production capacity.</p>

<p>Is there any hope of keeping zebra mussels from spreading?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Zebra mussels, those nasty, intake-pipe-clogging bivalves, were first 
spotted in the U.S. in 1988 in the Great Lakes, and despite tons of effort, 
time and money, have slowly spread throughout the country's fresh waters. They 
showed up in a western Massachusetts lake last year, their first New England 
appearance, and that state is spending $71,000 this year (up from $5,000 last 
year) on boat-cleaning and educational programs, in an attempt to keep them 
being carried inadvertently to other lakes and rivers by boaters.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This same approach has been taken for a variety of aquatic invasive weeds, 
and to be perfectly honest it hasn't worked all that well. Slowing down the 
spread seems to be about the best we can do.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Still, I guess you have to try. Here's a Berkshire Eagle story about the 
program.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's background info on zebra mussels.</p>

<p>Those of us with woodpiles outside are&nbsp;used to clearing out mouse 
nests as we reach the rows as spring approaches. Here's another thing to worry 
about as we move our wood inside.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There was a lot more information in the message given to the National Park 
Service, but on reading the fine print about distribution, I chickened out and 
am just providing the link for more info.</p>

<p>Spring is here - I got my first poison ivy</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I did some trailwork last weekend on part of the Wapack Trail, organized by 
Friends of the Wapack. (Liberal guilt mixed with post-winter outdoorsyness.) I 
only did brush cutting and I wore gloves and long sleeves ... but even so, I 
got poison ivy on both of my forearms. Not too bad, but annoying.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For my money, the most depressing scientific finding from increased CO2 in 
the atmosphere is that it will make poison ivy itchier and faster growing (as 
reported here). I am, alas, susceptible to the ^%$# stuff, and it isn't getting 
any better with age.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The wonderful Straight Dope column has a great summary of people's variable 
susceptibility to poison ivy -read it here.</p>

<p>It's the 31st birthday of spam! (not the meat-type substance)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The first spam, a DEC marketing staffer's email sent around the old 
ARPANet, was launched on this day in 1978, as I reminded by the Telegraph's 
weirdly entrancing feature called daily TWIP -read the item here. (TWIP stands 
for The Week in Preview, an every-Monday print feature about a few upcoming 
items in the Nashua region; the daily version is a quirky &quot;today in 
history&quot; tidbit that lands around noon; it is designed, I think, to break 
up the crime-and-courts items that dominate breaking news on a newspaper 
website during the day.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In case you doubt TWIP, note that the guy who ordered that first spam has 
his own wikipedia article, with several links to articles about him in more 
traditional publications. Talk about a bittersweet sort of fame.</p>

<p>Massachusetts has 45 megawatts of solar installed</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Massachusetts has about 45 megawatts &nbsp;of solar energy installed, and 
an additional 40 megawatts contracted for installation, according tothis 
article from Earth Techling. That's about, oh, 20 times the amount in New 
Hampshire, by my estimate. It also puts it just about in the top 10 states, 
according to theSolar Energy Industries Association as reported by the NY 
Times' Green blog.</p>

<p>The search for cottontail-saving scrubland is on</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Saving the endangered New England cottontail requires not just breeding 
more of them in zoos and releasing them into the wild, but getting the right 
kind of wild land to release them into. Hence a state program looking for 
people to help shape their property into the sort of scrubby lands that little 
rabbits like.</p>

<p>NASA has created a nice interactive feature, in preparation for the 50th 
anniversary of Alan Shepard's flight. His sub-orbital parabola was a hasty 
response to Yuri Gargain's orbits, 23 days earlier, but it showed that the U.S.

<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from gobbledygook
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We just had a newspaper staff meeting - which, like all newspaper staff 
meetings for the past couple of years, mostly concerned how to deal with the 
online world - and during it I heard myself say &quot;GraniteGeek automatically 
tweets all its posts.&quot; As soon as those words left my mouth, I realized 
that the sentence would have been absolute and complete gobbledygook during 95 
percent of my career.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Consider this a variation of Arthur C. Clarke's third law: Any sufficiently 
advanced technology is indistinguishable from gobbledygook.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the other hand, &quot;etaoinshrdlu&quot; is gibberish to anybody under 
age 45, so maybe the rule is time-agnostic: Any sufficiently<em>outdated </em>
technology is also indistinguishable from gobbledygook.</p>

<p>A swarm of micro-quakes in mid-coast Maine</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As many as 30 &quot;microquakes&quot;, registering less than 2 on the 
Richter scale, have been reported in recent days in the area of the Maine coast 
near Acadia National Park. Nothing alarming or too surprising, say geologists,

<p>Maine study says put wind turbines farther from homes</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the Portland Press-Herald: &quot;The minimum distance between homes 
and commercial wind turbines in Maine should be nearly doubled to 1,000 feet to 
limit the impacts of noise on residents, a long-awaited state report is 
recommending.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The report also serves as a primer on the complex study of wind 
noise. It summarizes the types of sound, such as the &quot;whooshing&quot; 
associated with the pressure from blades slicing through the air, as well as 
low-frequency noise and even &quot;infrasound,&quot; which is below the common 
limit of human perception. Also explored is wind shear, a measure of how speed 
increases with height, and a common source of complaint when the wind is 
blowing stronger at the turbine hub than on the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>The Boston Globe has a&nbsp; good piece about the complicated life cycle of 
the tick, in which it notes that the spread of the white-footed mouse is at

control Lyme.</p>

<p>How do computer models work?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My column in The Telegraph today is, if I may (or must) say so myself, a 
noble failure: My reach exceeded my grasp, as they say. I wanted to show how 
computer models work, so I talked to a guy who developed an economic model 
being distributed by FairPoint. But due to lack of space (in the column) and 
time (to research and write), and to the fact that I never really got an 
&quot;aha!&quot; feeling, I wasn't able to throw much light on the question. I 
even fell back on a lame&nbsp; &quot;laymen can't really judge computer models 
and have to trust the experts&quot; argument.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ah, well. You can't win &acirc;&#128;&#152;em all.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can read it here, if you have nothing better to do.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being photographed in public should be legal, but it is creepy</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I strongly believe that we Americans have the right to take pictures in 
public places - a right increasingly limited bynervous-nellie law enforcement 
andbusiness-protecting legislators.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Looking at things in public is part of our right to exist freely in a 
functioning democracy, and that right includes the right to record what we see 
or hear. The Powers That Be shouldn't try to keep that right to themselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's my belief, but I'll admit that it can be creepy to have a stranger 
take your picture for no obvious reason.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Case in point: On my commute this morning, I was sitting in line at a 
traffic light (with my hybrid's motor off, slightly reducing my eco-guilt) when 
I noticed that the guy behind me was using his cell phone to take a picture of 
the back of my car. I have no idea who he is, and when the light changed he 
drove off without a glance in my direction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What was that all about? I have no idea.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The car I'm driving was my wife's before we swapped. She put a political 
bumper sticker on the back, next to a pro-hybrid sticker that says &quot;My 
other car is out of gas&quot;. Perhaps their proximity stuck PhoneCamera Man as 
significant in some way, and the picture will show up on a blog/Facebook page 
to illustrate some politial commentary. Or maybe he thought the hybrid sticker 
was funny. Or maybe he is running my license plate number through a web-search 
algorithm so that he can find my address and egg my house because he disagrees 
with the political sticker. Or maybe he was just seeing how well his new phone 
took pictures through the windshield. Or maybe he was doing some weird 
phone-holding calisthenics and I'm being paranoid.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Whatever the reason, the whole thing annoyed me. <em>How dare this guy take 
my picture without my permission!</em>If I was a cop I probably would have 
pulled him over, before remembering that this is his right as a person in 
America.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All in all, it was a sobering reminder that tighly held principles often 
feel different when you encounter them in the real world.</p>

<p>Falcon from Acadia killed in Boston</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This from my brother who works at Acadia National Park in Maine.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This female Peregrine had a totol of 38 chicks during her 17 
years.Peregrine Falcon - adult female</p> 
<p>Bands - 987-63743, and 1/H black over red</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The attached photo was taken on the sidewalk at 140 Providence Street 
indowntown Boston, Suffolk Co., MA on 05-04-11.&nbsp; When found, the carcass 
wasvery desiccated, so she had been dead for weeks or longer and probablyblown 
off of a building ledge or a roof.&nbsp; Both bands were crushed andabraded 
suggesting that the legs had been run over, but probably bysomething like a 
bike rather than a vehicle.&nbsp; The body seems to be intact and not 
crushed.&nbsp; She may well have died or been killed by another<br>
 Peregrine 
in February or March.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This Peregrine was originally banded on The Precipice in Acadia 
NationalPark on Mt. Desert Island, ME in 1994, so she was 17 years old.&nbsp; 
Our recordis a 19 year old male that nested on the Customs House in Boston.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She was the founding female of the Christian Science Church 
AdministrativeBuilding nesting pair in Boston.&nbsp; This pair was the third 
nesting pair inMassachusetts after recovery began.&nbsp; The first two were on 
the CustomsHouse, Boston (1987)and the Monarch Place Building in Springfield 
(1989).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From 1996 through 2010 she produced 38 young that were banded.&nbsp; 
Several ofthese died in accidents near the nest site, and eight others turned 
up inRoxbury, MA; Rochester, MA; Weymouth, MA; Plum Island, Newbury, MA; 
GreenAirport, Providence, RI; Kinderhook, NY; Kennedy Airport, NY: and one 
female was found nesting on the Mid-Hudson Bridge, NY in 2003.</p>

<p>Slow-draining Lake Champlain is a slow-motion flood</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the explanation by Matt Sukoski of the Burlington Free-Press about 
why Lake Champlain, which hit record-high levels last weekend, will remain in 
flood stage for weeks:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Think of Lake Champlain as a bucket with a single hole at the bottom of it. 
That hole is the Richelieu River, the lake's only outlet. Virtually all of Lake 
Champlain's water flows into the river, which runs north toward Montreal.&nbsp; 
Picture the bucket that represents Lake Champlain partly filled with water from 
a shower head. Each spray from the shower head can be thought of as one of the 
many rivers and streams feeding into the lake. The system works fine as long as 
the shower isn't turned on full blast.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A record rainfall April on top of melting heavy snowfall turned the shower 
on full blast, and northwestern Vermont is still struggling with the result.</p>

<p>A couple more 'solar on a stick' panels in Nashua</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two more solar panels have been installed on utility poles in Nashua as 
part of a PSNH study of the usefulness of the alternative-energy approach 
sometimes called &quot;solar on a stick.&quot; PSNH set up four 200-watt panels 
on south Daniel Webster Highway poles in November, and earlier this month 
workers put up two larger panels, made by a different company, on West Hollis 
Street. It's all part of an experiment to see whether this system can be easily 
integrated into the grid.</p>

<p>A great video about spring skiing at Tuckerman Ravine</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's spring skiing season at Tuckerman Ravine, which is one of those events 
that make New Hampshire special. I've been to the bowl twice although I didn't 
ski it, since the only part I can handle are the flat bits at the bottom, which 
didn't seem worth the effort of hauling up skis. Just visiting it and seeing 
the whole Spring-Break-Meets-Backcountry-Ski vibe is worth it, though.</p>

<p>Maine &acirc;&#128;&#152;micro-quake swarm' was just the coast rebounding 
from the Ice Age</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wired has a nice, short write-up on the cause of the &quot;swarm of 
micro-quakes&quot; that were felt in Maine earlier this month: It's just the 
land continuing to rebound from the Ice Age. The glaciers pushed it down so 
much that it has taken 12,000 years to return.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By the time the Laurentide sheet melted 14,000 years ago, the crust was so 
depressed that coastal Maine sea levels &acirc;&#128;&#148; the measure of how 
far sea reaches up on land &acirc;&#128;&#148; were 230 feet higher than today. 
The crust rebounded so violently that within 3,000 years, sea levels were some 
200 feet lower than today's.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can read the piece here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the sort of thing that complicates measurements about sea-level 
rise, by the way.</p>

<p>Trying to recycle those annoying plastic bottle caps</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An organization called Gimme 5 is trying to develop a system to recycle 
plastic caps of plastic bottles, which generally can't be handled by standard 
single-stream waste facilities. (The name comes from No. 5 plastic, the type 
used to make caps because it holds threads better than the No.1 or No. 2 
plastic used for most bottles.) They've set up separate bins in Whole Foods 
markets in a number of states - but not New Hampshire,so far as I can tell from 
their website, even though they're partly underwritten by NH-based Stonyfield 
Farms. (Weirdly, they're not in Vermont, either; you'd think they'd do well in 
the Land of the Eco-heads.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I learned of them from this Burlington Free-Press story.</p>

<p>Here's a decent overview of the different types of plastic, from

<p>It's not the mama black bears we need to worry about</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Black bears are all over the place in NH - especially this time of year, 
when they're hungry after winter and love to rain bird feeders. So it's 
interesting that a new study found that, contrary to common belief, it's not 
mother bears protecting their cubs who are most likely to harm people; it's 
male bears foraging for food.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In other words, listen to NH Fish and Game and put away those bird feeders 
until later this summer!</p>

<p>Music in &quot;the cloud&quot; - an old idea that's new again</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Globe's Hiawatha Bray writes about proposals by Google and Amazon to 
let people store copies of their digital music online, so they can listen to it 
from any device. What I like, however, is this tidbit:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a lot to like about both these services. I'd have liked them just 
as much in 1997, when Michael Robertson pioneered the idea of a service to 
stream your own music. But the music companies hated the idea and sued<em>
MP3.com</em><em> into a coma.</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'd forgotten all about MP3.com, back when the term 
&quot;MP3&acirc;&#128;&sup3; was still cutting-edge and cool, at least to my 
age group. Had to believe that was 14 years ago ...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>1 in 8 people who ever lived are alive today</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A little calculus and some historical estimates of world population and 
life expectancy led the site 1000memories to estimate that 56 billion human 
beings have lived since we evolved from ape-like creatures 200,000 years ago. 
Since there are 7 billion of us alive today, that means the current population 
is 12.5% of the total historical population of the species.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Check out the number-crunching here. (Spotted via Treehugger)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The best large-scale news to happen in my lifetime has been the astonishing 
decline in humanity's birth rate, which has done much to defuse 
&quot;population bomb&quot; fears. But the total population continues to soar 
because there are so many of us having babies, even though we're having fewer 
babies each - the UN now estimates it will peak at 10.1 billion, which means 
adding a couple more Chinas to the world.</p>

<p>This is an allergy season to remember - which means, to forget</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pretty much every year we see news stories about how this is a particularly 
bad pollen season - for example,this WMUR report from the weekend, which says 
both tree and grass pollen are arriving at the same time - but at least as far 
as I'm concerned, this year truly is a hum-dinger. I'm sneezing with runny eyes 
and runny nose, going through my weight in kleenex every couple of hours.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It got so bad yesterday that I stuck my head inside the freezer compartment 
of the refrigerator - the pollen-free cold was a blessing!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The weird thing is that it rained like crazy yesterday - 1.64 inches in my 
CoCoRaHS gauge - which usually clears out the air. Didn't work, though.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mother Nature sure can be a pain in the neck.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ticks and Lyme disease</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in Maine and the 
second most common of the reportable infectious diseases in Maine. May is Lyme 
Disease Awareness Month in Maine so remember to do your tick checks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is carried by Ixodesscapularis 
(the deer tick). Cases have increased over the last five years in Maine, and 
occur in all 16 counties. Lyme disease is most common among school age children 
and middle age adults. As the weather continues to get warmer, more ticks will 
be out in the open, and most infections in Maine occur during the summer months.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The most common early symptom of Lyme disease is an expanding red rash that 
occurs at the site of the tick bite within 3-32 days after being bitten. Fever, 
join and muscle pains may also occur. Lyme disease is treatable, and the 
majority of patients recover after receiving appropriate therapy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lyme disease is preventable. Maine CDC recommends following the &quot;No 
Ticks 4 ME&quot; approach which includes:</p> 
<p>1. Wear protective clothing</p> 
<p>2. Use insect repellent</p> 
<p>3. Perform daily tick checks</p> 
<p>4. Use caution in tick habitats</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ticks must be attached for 24-48 hours before the bacteria can be 
transmitted, so prompt removal of ticks is extremely important. Anyone with a 
known tick bite, or who has been in a tick habitat should watch for symptoms 
for at least 30 days after the exposure. If symptoms develop, call your 
physician.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maine CDC has numerous educational materials available on our website at

<p>Free, fact-filled Science Cafe New Hampshire coming to Concord</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Would you like to talk about complicated subjects with people who 
understand the details, instead of just listening to advocates who rant and 
rave about their pre-conceived notions, or being subjected to somebody as lame 
as (shudder) a journalist?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sure you would! That's why you're going to attend the inaugural Science 
Cafe New Hampshire, next Tuesday (May 24) at 7 p.m. at The Barley House, 132 N. 
Main St., in Concord. It will feature the state climatologist, a city planner, 
and a UNH professor with a statistics expertise, who will discuss &quot;Climate 
Change in NH.&quot;<strong></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I will moderate, but that's no reason to stay away - I promise to keep my 
mouth mostly shut, letting the knowledgeable folks speak while whoever shows up 
asks questions. It's informal and loose; the only rule is NO POLITICS!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The plan is for monthly cafes; the June talk is titled &quot;The Future of 
Food.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's my column about it today. Here's the Science Cafe New Hampshire 
website.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I think this could be really good, but it depends on people attending with 
intelligent questions and open minds. That means you, Granite Geek reader!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nerd vs. Geek ... there's a big difference</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Kudos to Nashua High School North for honoring academic excellence ... but 
why did they have to call the event<strong>Nerdapalooza</strong>? Don't they 
know it should be<strong>Geekapalooza</strong>? They're a reason that you're 
not reading New Hampshire Nerd, after all.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geeks are knowledgeable and obsessed - a good definition of a geek is 
&quot;somebody more interested in the workings of a topic than society thinks 
you should be.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geeks don't have to be technical. You can be an art geek if you study the 
composition of paint or the mechanics of brushstrokes; a harmonica geek if you 
collect the instruments and learn the history, whether or not you play one; 
and, of course, a computer geek if you understand how the machines work beyond 
ctl-alt-del and want to learn more.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You cannot, however, be a wealth geek, because society thinks any possible 
amount of detailed interest in wealth is perfectly reasonable and even 
admirable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Nerd,&quot; on the other hand, carries connotations of dorkiness, 
social ineptitude, more than obsession. Considerthis Venn Diagram, which 
explains the difference.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hopefully the school will see the error of its ways and rename the event, 
which takes place from 5 pm to 7 pm, Saturday, May 21, 2011 at the NHS North 
medium gymnasium.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Science Honor Society will have booths featuring their research, there 
will be a barbeque and the New Hampshire Amateur Astronomers (<em>star geeks, 
not star nerds</em>) hosting a Star Party starting at 8:30 pm on the athletic 
fields at North.&nbsp; All events are free and open to all Nashua School 
District students, their families, and the general public. (Unless it rains, 
which it probably will)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No federal decision on blocking cave access, despite white-nose syndrome 
fears</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On Tuesday the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service announced a national plan 
to combat white-nose syndrome, the fungus-related disease that is devastating 
bat populations in the Eastern U.S. (See the plan, in PDF form, here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I just spent a few minutes flipping through it. It has lots of good 
background information and suggestions about organizing approaches and 
directing research, but the &quot;action plan&quot; section avoids the most 
contentious issue: Whether to close access to all caves on federal land, to 
protect isolated populations, until we know more about the disease.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some environmental groups like Bat Conservation International think such a 
sweeping action is necessary if we're going to prevent complete extinction of 
at least two bat species in North America. Other groups, notably cavers, think 
it would be going overboard (as I notedin a column last year) because we don't 
know whether the disease is actually being spread by the bats themselves, 
traveling here and there, rather than via contaminated boots or caving 
equipment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The report says FWS must &quot;manage cave access to minimize risk&quot; 
and &quot;investigate bat-to-bat transmission&quot; but makes no immediate 
recommendations for action about caves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, as this FWS page shows, the disease continues to spread and wipe 
out bat populations. It was spotted in 2006 in New York state, and is now found 
throughout New England and from western Kentucky to Ontario to Nova Scotia. I 
haven't had any bats around my barn for years; we once had a dozen or more 
catching bugs every dusk, all summer long.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>May 18, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A bear (I think) nailed our beehive and bird feeder</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Late Monday night we were visited by what appears to have been a bear. It 
ripped the bird feeder off our porch*, bending the supporting metal rod and 
tore up some of last year's beehive frames that were stacked in the barn, 
crunching on the wax and dried bits of honey, breaking a few in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It didn't touch the beehive itself, perhaps because the new hive hasn't had 
time to make much honey yet. So we rushed to set up the electric fence around 
it - although there's so much tall, wet grass that I'm afraid the shock will 
drain away; not sure how much of a disincentive it will be.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm surprised a bear could come up against the house without waking us, one 
floor above. I'm also surprised that there aren't any other signs of its 
presence on the fairly crowded porch - no scratches in the railing that it must 
have climbed on or leaned against, for example.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>*I know, I know - the state <em>says we shouldn't leave birdfeeders out 
right now</em><em> for that very reason. I've even written articles about it 
for the Telegraph, but do I listen to myself? No!</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maine: Sure, keep your old analog power meter, but it'll cost you</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The electric utility Central Maine Power Co. has intriguing plans to 
install two-way meters in customers' homes as a first step toward creating a 
&quot;smart grid,&quot; which shows promise toward increasing efficiency and 
reducing energy use. But it has stumbled over a few people'ssilly fear that the 
wireless transmitters will somehow do medical damage. Never mind the zillion 
other wireless transmission pulsing through our bodies every second of the day; 
the wireless meters are different because ... well, because they're new, I 
guess. New is scary.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>MPC says skipping some homes would undermine the whole point of a smart 
grid. Now the state Public Utilitiy Commission says they have to skip homes if 
customers demand it - but they can charge those customers an extra $20 
installation fee and $1.50 a month, as compensation for the hassle. It's 
unclear whether this will jump-start the whole project.&nbsp;Read the 
Press-Herald story here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is, by the way, a major worry with time-of-day pricing and other 
aspects of the smart grid, but it has nothing to do with unfounded fears. Such 
a change will upend long-established pricing patterns, and I worry that somehow 
the big industry folks will figure out how to shift more cost to us schlubs who 
get the bill.</p>

<p>Ranked-choice voting coming to Portland for mayor race</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Portland, Maine, is going to elect a mayor this year using ranked-choice 
voting, in which you list your preference for everybody on the ballot instead 
of just choosing one. It's the latest example of experiments in alternative 
voting methods that crop up now and then.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Burlington, Vermont, used a similar system for a few elections until voters 
tossed it out,as I've noted before; while a New Hampshire legislator wanted 
this state to consider adopting it here - an idea that has been shelved in 
committee and seems unlikely to go anywhere.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As explained by the Press-Herald, the election in Maine will work like this:
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Voters will mark their ballots not only for the candidate they'd like to 
see win, but also rank the rest in order of preference. If no candidate gets a 
majority of first-place votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is dropped 
and the second choices of those voters are added to the first-choice totals for 
all other candidates. It's possible that the new totals would require a change 
in the order of finish.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If no one has a majority after one candidate is dropped, the new last-place 
candidate is dropped and his or her second-choice votes are added to the 
first-choice totals. If any voter's second choice is a candidate who's already 
been eliminated, the voter's third choice gets the vote, and so on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent. Voters 
need not rank all the candidates, but that would reduce their say if the runoff 
process continues for more than a round or two.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Portland's mayor hasn't been directly elected for years, and a number of 
candidates are in the running. Ranked-choice voting makes more sense when there 
are a lot of roughly equivalent candidates.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How do you test a 90-meter windmill blade? Very carefully</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A huge testing facility for wind turbines, with the ability to test blades 
up to 90 meters long, is being built in Charlestown, Mass., just across the 
Charles River from Boston. Built partly with $24 million in stimulus funds, it 
the first facility in the U.S. that can test to truly large wind turbine 
blades.&nbsp; (Since wind power effectiveness is largely driven by the 
&quot;swept area&quot; of the turbine blades, bigger is better - so testing big 
blades is important.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From a Mass High Tech story: The center will provide the ability to test 
three blades simultaneously, along with 100 tons of overhead bridge crane 
capacity and a &quot;full suite&quot; of certification tests for turbine 
blades, according to the announcement. Tests will include static and fatigue 
testing, blade material testing, dual axis static or fatigue testing and 
quality testing.</p>

<p>E-books outselling printed books at Amazon</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon says it is now selling more e-books than hardcover and paperback 
printed books, combined, by roughly 5 % - and that doesn't include free e-books.
Here's the AP item.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon wants to sell e-books because of the profits from Kindle, just as 
Apple used iTunes to boost sales of the iPod, and so it has an incentive to 
triumph electronic sales. I don't know who double-checks their data - SEC, 
maybe? Still, it does seem like we're passing through some sort of transition 
point in publishing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How to put out a fire: Spray it with liquid manure</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Union-Leader has a great story about a New Hampshire farmer who 
extinguished the fire in a burning truck, one that was too far from the road 
for a fire pumper to get to, by spraying it with 15,000 gallons of liquified 
cow manure from his storage area.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Check out the story here - or you can watch a video here, on Firehouse.com.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boy that fire must have stunk when it was out. Thank goodness the Web 
doesn't have scratch-and-sniff functionality ...</p>

<p>Environment and jobs vs. environment and jobs - ship-launching version</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's an interesting debate around the Bath Iron Works, as reported in 
the Portland Press-Herald (read it here): When to dredge the Kennebec River. 
Apparently the river needs to be dredged in order for large ships to be 
launched, including a $1 billion destroyer nearing completion. Usually the 
dredging is done in the fall, after shellfish season and tourist season are 
over, but the Navy wants to do it in August so it can launch the destroyer 
sooner.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The result is a complicated fight: jobs from the Bath Iron Works vs. jobs 
in fishing/tourism, with the environmental community wanting the dredging to be 
delayed so it does less damage to the river/bay bottom (a contention that not 
everybody agrees with).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The dispute is also a reminder of how much humans alter the landscape, as a 
matter of course.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Don't move firewood ... dot-org, of course</p> 
<p>I have a story in the Sunday Telegraph about a push to make it illegal to 
bring firewood into New Hampshire from out of state (it's already illegal to 
bring out-of-state wood onto state lands) in an attempt to slow the spread of 
invasive bugs.Here's the story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For me, the most interesting part was hearing of research which found that 
40 percent of the people who come into NH to camp bring their own firewood, 
presumably to avoid paying $5 to $10 for the stuff near campsites. Further, 
researchers sampled some firewood and found 600 different insect species living 
in 19 samples. Apparently, people haulting sticks in their trunks or the back 
of their RV is a major vector for insect movement in this country.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By coincidence, yesterday my wife and I were to New York state, which has

<p>Argument over items left in rental housing may have led to Gene Mallove's 
murder</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Filed under General by david brooks at 6:04 am </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It has been seven years since Eugene Mallove - New Hampshire's cold fusion 
advocate and creator of &quot;Infinite Energy&quot; magazine - was killed at 
his childhood home in Connecticut, and his death remains something of a 
mystery. Over the weekend, police in Nortwich, Conn., arrested a third suspect, 
adding to the two people arrested a couple of months back. The local paper says 
&quot;courtroom testimony&quot; indicates that Mallove was beaten to death in a 
fight after the people, former tenants of the house, &quot;learned Mallove was 
throwing away (a former tenant's) parents' belongings after their 
eviction.&quot; Allegedly they beat him to &quot;near death ... then returned 
with her to the scene of the beating in order to make it look like a 
robbery.&quot;</p>

<p>Want to make more money? Get a science/tech college degree</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I assume that people who read a column called Granite Geek are more likely 
to have college degrees in the sciences than in the humanities, so we'll all 
get some self-satisfaction from this story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Over a lifetime, the earnings of workers who have majored in engineering, 
computer science or business are as much as 50&nbsp;percent higher than the 
earnings of those who major in the humanities, the arts, education and 
psychology, according to an analysis by researchers at Georgetown University's 
Center on Education and the Workforce.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's no guarantee, of course. My bachelor's degree is in mathematics (no 
advanced degree, for better or worse). For my entire career I have generally 
been the only person in the newsroom with a science degree - yet I have not 
generally been the best-paid person in the newsroom.</p>

<p>Using a power plant's waste heat as heat is harder than it sounds</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A 50-megawatt wood-burning electrical power plant has operated in the heart 
of Burlington, Vermont, for decades. One of the mantras in biomass power these 
days is &quot;combined heat and power&quot;&nbsp; - not just generating 
electricity but&nbsp; using the waste heat as, well, heat in nearby buildings - 
so the eco-conscious folks in Vermont are pondering whether to do the same with 
theirMcNeil Generating Plant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It seems a no-brainer, but it's more complicated than you might think. 
(Isn't everything?) There are technical questions, such as whether it&nbsp; is 
better to transfer the heat via steam or hot water, and, perhaps more 
importantly, financial and city-planning questions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a long and detailed analysis from the Burlington Free-Press - an 
interesting look about the devil-in-the-details which make all the difference

Concord at 7 p.m. for the first Science Cafe New Hampshire, featuring a 
discussion about the science and technology of coping with climate change in 
New Hampshire - with the state climatologist, Keene city planner and a UNH 
professor.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is a FREE, informal discussion, not a lecture; you can buy dinner and/or

<p>The first Science Cafe was a blast - next one June 21</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Almost 50 people (plus some family and friends) filled the basement lounge 
of the Barley House restaurant/tavern last night for the first free Science 
Cafe New Hampshire, which discussed climate change. The next one is June 21, on
the Future of Food - be there!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire Public Radio and the Concord Monitor's weekly paper will have 
coverage of last night's event. I was moderating so I couldn't take notes, but 
here are a few highlights from my memory banks:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>** State climatologist Mary Stampone says that she doesn't think the 
biggest devastation that's coming due to climate is an an increase in big 
storms - hurricanes, tornadoes - but the increased likelihood of drought. If 
the U.S. Southwest goes into a dustbowl scenario, watch out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>** Keene City Planner Rhett Lamb gave an interesting example of planning 
for life in a climate-changed world: Culverts. These big metal tubes allow 
streams and brooks to flow under roadways, and their dimensions are based on 
historical rainfall/runoff data. If those numbers increase sharply, as climate 
models indicate they will, flooded roads will become the norm. So as part of 
routine upgrades and maintenance, the city is putting in bigger culverts - 
which costs more money with no immediate, obvious return. Not an easy move for 
a city council to make.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>** UNH Sociologist Larry Hamilton got into climate change work out of 
sociological research decades ago in the Arctic, where the climate is already 
changing. Talking to people having to make adjustments led him into work 
figuring out why the changes were happening. He calls himself a &quot;cheerful 
pessimist&quot; on the topic: He thinks the planet is in big, big trouble, but 
that perhaps we'll figure a way out of complete disaster.</p>

<p>FairPoint uses draft horses to lay fiber optic</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>VTdigger.org, an online journalism site for Vermont, has a profile of a 
1,700-pound drafthorse used to lay fiber-optic cable for FairPoint in northeast 
Vermont.Here's the whole story, and here's a taste of it:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a so-called &quot;telephone horse,&quot; Fred starts the morning by 
towing 48-fiber cable (so called because of the 48 individual strands of glass 
cables wound into an inch-thick band) from a massive spool on the rear of a 
FairPoint truck. Then he backtracks with the crew, drawing the overhead lasher 
along utility wires between poles. They pause frequently to jump poles and 
troubleshoot snags.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fred is 14, and he's been laying line for five years. Desmarais, who lives 
in Westmore, has laid line with draft horses for 31 years, and he learned to 
drive a team on his father's farm in Barton when he was young. He travels to 
Amish country in the Midwest at least once a year to appraise new equipment and 
buy a horse, if one catches his eye&acirc;&#128;&#147;as Fred did one year 
while Desmarais was in Indiana. Desmarais has four draft horses, another 
Belgian and two Percherons: a second team lays line for FairPoint elsewhere in 
the state.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I spotted this via Slashdot, of all place&nbsp; - which drew some excellent 
reader comments, including this one:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A horse is a self-replicating semi-autonomous rover optimized for 
negotiating tough terrain, and it was developed without DARPA assistance. It is 
powered by biofuels that can be produced using COTS technologies, but which for 
which no DOE research is required. Its waste stream is biodegradeable, and in 
the quantities generated by a single horse, facilities for the storage and 
processing of the waste pending biodegradation do not require EPA approval.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Report warns about spent fuel in cooling pools at nuclear power plants, 
including Vermont Yankee and Seabrook</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant has more used radioactive fuel 
stored in pools at the plant than is stored at all four of the Japanese damaged 
Fukushima Daiichi reactors, says a new report that raises concern about the 
long-term safety of such storage.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Seabrook Station has about two-thirds as much fuel stored in its pools, 
according to the report. You can read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Written by the nonprofit Institute for Policy Studies, the report urges 
that used fuel to transferred to &quot;dry casket&quot; storage, either at each 
power plant or at central repositories, to limit the risk of a release of 
radioactive material resulting from an earthquake, storm, terrorism or building 
fire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Even though they contain some of the largest concentrations of 
radioactivity on the planet, U.S. spent nuclear fuel pools are mostly contained 
in ordinary industrial structures designed to merely protect them against the 
elements,&quot; says the report, titled &quot;Spent Nuclear Fuel Pools in the 
U.S.: Reducing the Deadly Risks of Storage.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Safely securing the spent fuel by eliminating highly radioactive, 
crowded pools should be a public safety priority of the highest degree.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The report estimates that America's 104 plants have produced 65,000 metric 
tons of spent fuel, 75 percent of which is stored in pools at the power plants 
themselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Seabrook has 425 tons of material on site, with a total radioactivity of 81 
million curies, while Vermont Yankee has 609 tons, with a total radioactivity 
of 100 million curies.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These amounts are dwarfed by the fuel stored at many other plants, which 
have two to four times as much spent fuel, according to the report's estimates. 
Direct comparison can be difficult, however, because of varied makeup of 
radioactive elements in spent fuel.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At one time the national plan was to move such fuel into dry storage casks 
inside Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but that plan was scuttled by the Obama 
administration after years of dispute and controversy.</p>

<p>Removing Rust through Technology</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>David asked me to write more about what I'm doing. So, here's the latest 
project.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was just given an Edelstaal miniature lathe that had been stored in less 
than ideal conditions. It's mostly aluminum, but the ways and accessory parts 
are steel that had some rust on them. The 4 jaw and 3 jaw chuck especially were 
quite badly rusted. Instead of attacking the rust with sandpaper and steel 
wool, I'm using an electrolytic method that actually converts the rust back to 
iron. It's a lot better than naval jelly, coke or muriatic acid. Voltages and 
currents are low enough that there is almost no hazard from fumes or fire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The container is a cat litter bucket with a couple of gallons of water and 
washing soda to make the water conductive. The electrode surrounding the to be 
cleaned part is made of iron or steel. I surround the part with a rolled up 
bandsaw blade that was due to be tossed out anyway.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The power supply can be a cheap battery charger capable of a couple of amp 
output. 12 volts is about right, it's not a critical element in the process. 
The positive side of the power supply is connected to the bandsaw blade and the 
negative side connected to the rusted part. After a few hours, 2 to 8 hours 
depending on the amount of rust, the part is removed, flushed off and polished 
with steel wool. It's remarkable how effective this is. I have a few other 
tools hanging around that were too good to be thrown out quite yet that will be 
going into the tank soon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If anyone wants a more thorough description of the process, here are a 
couple of links to some more good information.</p>

<p>White nose syndrome shows up in Maine bats</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I hadn't realized that white-nose syndrome had not been found in Maine 
until, alas, that statement was no longer true. It has been found in two of the 
state's three known bat hibernation sites,reports AP.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story is nothing new but still depressing:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;As it continues to spread we don't see anything slowing the spread of 
the fungus down,&quot; Ann Froschauer of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
said during a conference call with reporters. &quot;We're down into North 
Carolina and Tennessee and into the Midwest in Kentucky and Indiana and Ohio, 
and we don't seem to see any slowing down of the fungus being spread among bats 
in those areas.&quot;</p>

<p>Biologist is counting how many bugs are killed by cars (yes, bugs)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This isn't local, but it's too interesting to ignore: A biologist in the 
Netherlands is trying to quantify the toll taken on bugs by automobiles.He's 
not worried about extinction, though - he just wants to use the data as a way 
to estimate insect demographics</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the article in Treehugger:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>The biologist from the University of Wageningen believes that around 
500 billion insects are killed each year in vehicle strikes in the Netherlands 
alone, but within those little deaths lie clues about how bugs are distributed, 
information that has been thus far elusive. By enlisting the help of drivers 
Dutch drivers, van Vliet hopes to determine when and where insect populations 
are most dense, and how climate conditions may impact those figures.</em></p>

<p>GOP presidential hopefuls have to reject global warming to be viable</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tuesday's Science Cafe discussion about climate change avoided the deadly 
taint of political discussion, which I also try to avoid here in Granite Geek, 
but just in case you thought that weather extremes were moderating anti-global 
warming extremes, and AP story reminds us that Republican presidential hopefuls 
must be climate change deniers to make it through the party primary:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Republican presidential hopefuls can believe in man-made global warming as 
long as they never talk about it, and oppose all the so-called solutions,&quot; 
said Marc Morano, a former aide to Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, one of the most 
vocal climate skeptics in Congress</p>

<p>Help the state keep track of all those wild turkeys</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The state wants your help keeping track of all those wild turkeys - the 
birds, not the beverage - that are spreading throughout southern New Hampshire. 
They have established an online form for you to report those funny-looking 
flocks as they wander through your front yard. It kicks in June 1: Telegraph 
story is here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wild turkeys might be our best wildlife restoration story of recent years. 
The species had been wiped out of the state (&quot;extirpated&quot; is, I 
believe, the term) by hunting until a small population was brought from New 
York state to the Keene area, in the late 1970s. Since then they've multiplied 
and their range has extended so far that there is both a&nbsp; spring and fall 
turkey hunting season now, and it's no longer unusual to see a flock crossing 
even a busy urban road.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It used to be that seeing a wild turkey was like seeing a bobcat - you'd 
stop the car and scream in excitement. Now it's like seeing a deer - nice, 
worth slowind down slightly, but nothing major. At this rate, in 10 years it'll 
be like seeing Canada geense - you'll share your fist at the darn things as a 
nuisance rather than a pleasure.</p>

<p>EPA considers tighter pollution controls on most home wood-burning heat</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tux Turkel at the Portland Press-Herald has a good, detailed piece on EPA 
proposals to tighten pollution controls, particularly limits of fine-particle 
emissions, for most wood-burning heat sources used by homes, from pellet stoves 
to those obnoxious outdoor boilers (which, I learned from the article, are 
officially called &quot;hydronic heaters&quot;).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Indoor fireplaces aren't covered, under the theory that they're ornamental 
more than heat-related - and, critically, existing units aren't covered either, 
even though they can pollute like nobody's business. He mentions last year's 
program in Keene that used used $106,000 in federal money to buy 86 old wood 
stoves and given vouchers to help replace them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He says they represent the first substantial changes since the EPA set 
performance standards to &quot;certify&quot; wood stoves, 23 years ago, and 
that the compliance date for wood stoves and outdoor boilers is likely to be 
June 2014. Other standards will kick in by 2017.</p>

<p>UNH data-driven modeling keeps track of carbon sources and sinks</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the UNH News Office: Scientists Jingfeng Xiao and Scott Ollinger of 
the University of New Hampshire'sInstitute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and 
Space (EOS) have received funding from the National Science Foundation to cover 
help quantify continental-scale carbon fluxes or so-called carbon 
&quot;sources&quot; and &quot;sinks&quot; in the long-term effort to craft more 
accurate climate change forecasts and facilitate climate policymaking.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The UNH research is based on a unique modeling method pioneered by Xiao, 
and will make use of very large sets of ecological data only recently available 
from study sites across North America.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Xiao is the project's principal investigator and a research assistant 
professor in the EOS Complex Systems Research Center (CSRC). The $517,000 award 
from NSF will fund the three-year project.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The grant is awarded under the first round of competitively awarded grants 
for the agency's new Macrosystems Biology program, designed to spur research on 
ecosystem processes and their complex interactions with climate, land use, and 
invasive species at regional to continental scales. If the continental-scale 
carbon budget can be &quot;closed,&quot; scientists will be in a better 
position to make climate forecasts, particularly with respect to year-to-year 
variability in the carbon budget caused by large-scale disturbances like 
droughts or forest fires.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Xiao's successful proposal results in part from pioneering work he has 
conducted over the last four years. Specifically, he has developed and refined 
a modeling method whereby data gathered at individual ecological &quot;flux 
tower&quot; research sites across North America can be &quot;upscaled&quot; or 
extrapolated to provide a statistically accurate picture of carbon fluxes 
across the entire continent and encompassing different ecosystem and climate 
types.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;This approach is very different from traditional ecosystem models, 
which are built upon a lot of complex, underlying ecosystem processes,&quot; 
Xiao explains. &quot;Our method is a data-driven approach, meaning it is an 
empirical, statistical model using vast amounts of data being gathered 
year-round on an hourly basis by the network of flux towers. This approach can 
lead to model parameters that are more representative of the full spectrum of 
vegetation and climate conditions, and to more robust estimates of ecosystem 
carbon fluxes over broad regions.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The network of more than 100 towers dotted around the North American 
continent measures the covariance (how much two variables change together) of 
vertical wind velocity and fluctuating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration 
around the tower's one-square-kilometer footprint. From this data, the exchange 
of CO2 between the ecosystem and atmosphere can be accurately calculated. 
Xiao's modeling method essentially allows the numbers from the individual tower 
sites to be crunched together into the bigger picture.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The creation of NSF's Macrosystems Biology program follows the agency's 
ambitious National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which when completed 
in 2016 will provide the first continental network of data-gathering stations. 
The 62 NEON sites will make some 270 measurements in their respective 
ecological systems.</p>

<p>Can moose be an invasive species in Canada???</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Economist, that fine weekly magazine with a boring name, has a cool 
item this week about the most<em>unexpected invasive spcies I've ever heard of. 
Here's a snippet:</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The moose may be a Canadian icon, but in the island of Newfoundland it is 
an alien, introduced a century ago when local leaders reckoned their presence 
would attract hunters and tourists to what was a struggling British colony. 
Unlike in the rest of Canada, the moose has no natural predators on the island, 
where the native wolf went extinct. There are now around 150,000 of the 
lumbering giants in Newfoundland. That has drawn hunters. But the habit of the 
moose to wander across highways in the dark has made it a road hazard 
responsible for around 700 collisions a year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NH, by contrast, has about 250 collisions a year (says NH Fish and Game) - 
and we have more traffic. I guess our moose are more road-savvy.</p>

<p>Mass. flywheel energy company is ready to hit the big time</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Beacon Power of Tyngsborough, Mass., is preparing to unveil its 20-MW 
energy storage plant in Stephentown, N.Y. The plant uses 200 flywheels spinning 
in vacuum chambers to deliver bursts of power as needed to compensate for 
wind/solar variation, and more importantly to provide frequency regulation, 
which helps to stabilize the electric grid by balancing power supply levels. 
They have another plant in the works in Pennsylvania.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The wheels (carbon-fiber composite rim supported by a metal hub) spin at 
between 8,000 and 16,000 rpm - at the latter, the flywheel can store and 
deliver 25 kWh of extractable energy very quickly. At 16,000 rpm, the company 
says, the surface speed of the rim is approximately Mach 2 or about 1500 
mph.&nbsp;Here's their technical description.</p>

<p>Rock Snot loves pristine streams - the cleaner the better</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the mysteries of the slimy creek-polluting algae known as &quot;rock 
snot&quot;, more officially called didymo, is how they survive in very pristine 
streams. Clear brooks and rivers are clear because they don't contain much in 
the way of the nutrients that algae needs to grow, particularly phosphorus. So, 
how does didymo survive in clean places like the upper reaches of the 
Connecticut River?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By using special bacteria to &quot;scrub&quot; any phosphorus off the 
bottom of the creeks, condensing it with iron in a way that increases the 
biological availability of phosphorus, making the nutrient available to didymo 
even though they're inaccessible to most other living things. That's according 
to a new study of rock snot in South Dakota streams - you can read&nbsp;a 
summary from the Nastional Science Foundation here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The hope is that this discovery will lead to new methods of containing or 
eradicating rock snot before it turns most of the nation's mountain streams 
into slippery, insect-deprived wastelands.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The main battle being fought against Rock Snot right now is theattempt to 
ban felt soles on fisherman wading boots. The soles are great at gripping wet 
rocks, but they're impossible to clean compared to rubber soles, so they can 
more easily spread contamination from stream to stream.</p>

<p>Argh! I paid money for some *homeopathic* baloney!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I can't entirely disagree with the argument that if people want to waste 
their money on useless pseudo-medicine, we should let them - the placebo effect 
is powerful, after all. But makers of hoo-hah need to be up front about their 
nonsense, otherwise they're just deluding us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I say this because I have been deluded. I recently realized that I bought 
some homeopathic - i.e., useless - medicine.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's made by Tecnu, a company with a good reputation for medication that 
prevents poison ivy infection, by applying it before contamination. This is 
slightly different stuff, called Medicated Poison Ivy Scrub, designed to help 
after you've touched the ^%$#@ plants. (Yes, I'm very sensititve) The bottle 
has lots of big words about &quot;works in 15 seconds&quot; and &quot;relieves 
itching&quot; and &quot;removes poison oils&quot; all over the bottle. But 
right at the bottom, in smaller type that even the net weight listing, I 
noticed last week that it says&nbsp; HOMEOPATHIC.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I saw that I checked the ingredient list. I thought the active 
ingredient (Grindella robusta) was listed at 3%, a perfectly reasonable amount 
in medication &hellip; but it's actually 3X, which is homeo-nonesense for 
diluted 10^4 (I think) times. I've paid money for a placebo!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What a ripoff. If I was a lawymaker I'd immediately submit a bill requiring 
that makes of homeopathic medicine include that term in writing at least as 
large as any other word on the label.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, I had used this medicine before I realized that it was nonesense, so 
the question is: did it work? The answer is: It seemed to help the itch, but 
it's a gritty paste and rubbing it on was a distraction, if nothing else. I did 
not notice that it shortened the days-long infection period, which is what I 
really wanted, but I'm not sure I ever applied it soon enough after getting 
infected to expect that the oils could be removed. So I can't judge its 
effectiveness one way or the other.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I can, however, say that a product in which the active ingredient exists in 
homeopathic amounts is a product that has no active ingredient at all. They 
shouldn't hide that fact.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>June 6, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Can there be fake homeopathic medicine (with real ingredients, but 
pretending not to?)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Is it possible to have fake homeopathic medicine - that is, medicine which 
pretends to be homeopathic but actually contains useful amounts of an 
ingredient? (Why would a drug company do that? Maybe because they know 
believers in homeopathy will shell out bucks for stuff that does nothing, so if 
their medicine is a dud, slapping &quot;homeopathic&quot; on the label gives 
them a new market - like adding &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;as seen on 
TV&quot;.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I ask this question because of a comment by reader John Rosenau on my 
previous post, in which I complained that I had bought homeopathic poison-ivy 
medicine from a company called Tecnu, without realizing it. Rosenau noted that 
the medicine has an active ingredient listed at 3X, which means diluted 10 x 10 
x 10 times, and that an active ingredient concentration of one-tenth of a 
percent isn't all that unusual for real medicine. &quot;Homeopaths tend to deal 
in concentrations of 60X, corresponding to 1:10^60&acirc;&#128;&sup3; he wrote. 
&quot;The problem here is that &acirc;&#128;&#152;homepathic' is 
ill-defined.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That led to the mind-boggling idea of a &quot;real&quot; homepath 
complaining because Tecnu is only *pretending* to be homeopathic! I have this 
vision of a trial before the North American Society of Homeopaths in which 
upholders of the faith shout in outrage that Tecnu's medication actually 
performs some medical service, going against all the tenents of homepathy!</p>

has a good article about a side industry blooming because of a $1.4 billion 
upgrade of Central Maine Power's transmission system (an upgrade largely 
designed to handle Maine's growing wind-farm production).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That side industry is building temporary wooden roads so that heavy 
equipment can drive over mud and dirt, carrying heavy equipment. These 
&quot;timber mats&quot; have evolved over the years from loose logs to 
16-foot-wide paths of hardwood logs bolted together. Maine timberlands have an 
advantage because out-of-state timber mats must have all their bark removed, to 
reduce the chance that they'll carry invasive weeds or bugs with them - that 
cost isn't necessary for in-state wood.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's a good piece covering what will eventually be $100 million worth of 
temporary roads.&nbsp;Read the article here.</p>

<p>E. coli outbreaks occur because food is full of excrement</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a story in the Telegraph today in which officials express concern 
and confusion about the E. coli outbreak inGermany (you can read it here), but 
to be frank, there's a much better story on Slate that gets right to the point: 
E. coli outbreaks occur in meat and on various produce because we fertilize 
food with excrement, and because it's hard to kill animals without some of the 
excrement in their intestines getting in the food.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article doesn't call it excrement, though.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It also argues that we tip-toe around the issue, just as I'm tip-toeing 
around writing the word &quot;shit&quot;, which makes it hard to have an 
intelligent discussion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I strongly suggest you&nbsp;read the article here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's got a really excellent closing, too: &quot;The current German O104 
situation &hellip; has grimly served to remind us of the frailty of life and 
the wonders of good plumbing. More than anything else, the science behind E. 
coli<em>&nbsp;</em>emphatically points out something far more horrifying than 
any one outbreak:&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;<em>doesn't like us</em>. It 
doesn't hate us, but it doesn't like us. Rather, it is perfectly and eternally 
disinterested.&quot;</p>

<p>Even the most secure of security tech firms can be hacked, as RSA shows</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Globe has a story about how hackers swiped information about a bunch of 
SecureID tokens, used to gain tempoerary access to secure computer networks, 
from RSA Security in Hopkinton, Mass. Since RSA Security was founded by the 
guys who invented the RSA public-key algorithm, it would seem to be as secure 
as they come. Nothing is secure, I guess.</p>

<p>Invasive wasp battles invasive emerald ash borer, and hopefully won't cause 
more problems</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>History is full of examples of species being imported to solve an 
environmental problem and then causing more problems that were there 
originally.&nbsp; It happens so often that scientists are now&nbsp;trying to 
model&nbsp;when it's viable and when it isn't.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But biological control is so potent that it's still worth trying. Here's an 
example: Wisconsin researchers are testing waspsp from China in an attempt to 
limit the spread of emerald ash borer, which is perhaps the most destructive of 
all invasive insects threatening America's forests at the moment. (They're not 
in N.H. yet, but it has made it to New York State and probably will be here 
eventually.)</p>

<p>Some diversity of opinion on climate change in GOP ranks</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sorry for the political note again, folks, but since I was critical 
recently of the way GOP presidential hopefuls have to kowtow to the 
climate-change deniers, I should note that this isn't universal: Mitt Romney 
agrees that the globe is warming and humans are part of the problem.
Politico/U-L item here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And although this isn't presidential politics, the GOP congressman for the 
western half of the state, Charlie Bass, also agrees that human-caused global 
warming is real (as I noted&nbsp;in this post), although he disagrees with many 
current legislative efforts to fight the problem.</p>

<p>Fungi causing pine needle damage in Maine</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From Maine Forest Service:&nbsp;AUGUSTA, Maine &acirc;&#128;&#147; Maine 
residents are reporting that they are seeing more and more damage throughout 
the state to Eastern white pine trees, particularly with the yellowing, 
browning and loss of needles, according to Maine Forest Service officials, 
under the Maine Department of Conservation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Homeowners, landowners, and foresters should expect to see unusual and 
excessive shedding of infected, one-year-old tree needles over the next few 
weeks as needle diseases, caused specifically by three fungi, have reached 
epidemic proportions around the state, according to MFS Health and Monitoring 
staff.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Not much can be done to halt the needle loss, though good forest management 
can protect the trees, they said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;It's definitely a stressor &acirc;&#128;&#147; it's certainly going 
to weaken the trees,&quot; William Ostrofsky, MFS forest pathologist, said. 
&quot;Some will get it lightly and not be affected too much, but trees that are 
affected can lose about 50 percent of their needles reducing their energy 
sources by half. They can be severely damaged by this.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>White pine normally holds two year's growth of needles, Ostrofsky pointed 
out. For the past few years, damage to Eastern white pine foliage has been 
observed throughout the state.&nbsp; Last year, the needle diseases became 
epidemic following high infection levels caused by the excessively wet summer 
of 2009.&nbsp; Although last year was somewhat drier, infection levels 
continued to remain unexpectedly high, resulting now in the premature shedding 
of the one-year-old needles, the forest pathologist said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Several fungi appear to be the cause of the needle damage, with three fungi 
of particular importance, Ostrofsky said. Brown spot needle blight, or&nbsp;<em>
Mycosphaerella dearnessii,</em>&nbsp;and white pine&nbsp; needlecast, or&nbsp;
<em>Canavirgella banfieldii</em>, were known from previous years, and this 
spring, another needle pathogen,&nbsp;<em>Bifusella linearis</em>, was 
identified in tree stands found damaged last year, he said. All three can occur 
on the needles of the same tree, and each one causes similar symptoms, he said.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The trees most affected are mature and over-mature trees on poor growing 
sites with shallow soils, and those growing at the edge of water bodies, in wet 
areas, and on dry, steep slopes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The damage is &quot;very widespread&quot; and affecting a large portion of 
the state, the forest pathologist said, adding that this week he observed 
damaged pines in the Leeds/Turner area. Last year, infected trees in and around 
western, central, and southern Maine were losing their lower, weaker branches 
to the disease. The needle damage has been reported from as far north as 
Township 7 Range 12, he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ostrofsky said that the Maine Forest Service and other New England states 
in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service are conducting a regional survey to 
more accurately delineate the range of the fungi across northern New England. 
The survey will continue this summer and is expected to be completed early next 
year, he said. Ostrofsky added that changing tree stand conditions will require 
regular monitoring for the next few years to better assess management risks to 
the affected pines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No fungicides are being recommended to control the spread of the diseases, 
Ostrofsky said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;There are not a lot of things anyone can do, but one thing that can 
be done is not disturb the trees by doing any thinning,&quot; he said. Other 
forest management practices that might disturb affected tree stands also should 
be avoided, he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eastern white pine is a significant tree in Maine, with 477 million white 
pine trees, 1-inch in diameter or larger, according to the most recent survey 
done in 2009, Ken Laustsen, MFS biometrician said. White pine makes up 2 
percent of all Maine trees and 4 percent of all commercial softwood, he said. 
In 2009, the stumpage value of the species amounted to $32 million worth of 
white pine pulpwood and saw timber.</p>

<p>Network breaches are inevitable says depressing Globe story</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Globe's Hiawatha Bray has a long, depressing story today that says, 
basically, all computer networks and their data are vulnerable and getting more 
so: &quot;Sntivirus and other commercial security software products may be 
adequate against the kind of amateur hackers who vandalized websites in the 
Internet's early days, but they often fail to detect the custom-made attack 
programs, or malware, created by today's organized crime gangs and foreign 
intelligence agencies.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the story, although since it's the weekend maybe you want to skip it 
until Monday.</p>

<p>Building a &quot;shadow Internet&quot; to go around the bad guys</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a job any thriller-loving geek would like to have: &quot;a group of 
young entrepreneurs who look as if they could be in a garage band are fitting 
deceptively innocent-looking hardware into a prototype &quot;Internet in a 
suitcase.&quot; Financed with a $2 million State Department grant, the suitcase 
could be secreted across a border and quickly set up to allow wireless 
communication over a wide area with a link to the global Internet.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This delightful detail is part of an NY Times story (read it here) about 
U.S. efforts to create mobile networks that can work around government 
crackdowns in places like Iran and Afghanistan. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Creating simple lines of communication outside official ones is crucial, 
said Collin Anderson, a 26-year-old liberation-technology researcher from North 
Dakota who specializes in Iran, where the government all but shut down the 
Internet during protests in 2009. The slowdown made most 
&quot;circumvention&quot; technologies &acirc;&#128;&#148; the software 
legerdemain that helps dissidents sneak data along the state-controlled 
networks &acirc;&#128;&#148; nearly useless, he said. &quot;No matter how much 
circumvention the protesters use, if the government slows the network down to a 
crawl, you can't upload YouTube videos or Facebook postings,&quot; Mr. Anderson 
said. &quot;They need alternative ways of sharing information or alternative 
ways of getting it out of the country.&quot;</p>

<p>Screen shot (don't bother clicking it) of solar power output for PSNH 
Energy Park.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Good weather for plants, lousy for solar power</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Achilles heel of solar and wind power is, of course, variability. Our 
wet, cloudy, cool spring/early summer demonstrates this weakness perfectly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Consider the 51-kilowatt photovoltaic system that PSNH installed on its 
Manchester headquarters. Its output was down almost 30 percent in May, compared 
to a year before and down almost 20 percent in April.&nbsp; (Above is a 
screenshot of their online output panel, which you can see at&nbsp;
http://www.psnh.com/RenewableEnergy/About-PSNH/Solar-at-Energy-Park.aspx)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In this climate, at least, you need some backup if you want PV to be a 
large piece of your power supply.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, over this period the cost of fuel for the system stayed 
unchanged - zero! - even as it fluctuated wildly for traditional systems. So 
everything has drawbacks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The chart indicates that May 2011 produced 5,962 kilowatt-hours vs. 8,338 
iun May 2011; April 2011 produced 5,526 kWh vs. 6,750 in April 2010.</p>

<p>A cougar killed by SUV in Connecticut - does that say anything about them 
here?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lots of people swear there are cougars (or mountain lions, which are the 
same thing) in New Hampshire, although wildlife officials doubt it. The 
doubters point to lack of hard evidence: no photos from the many automated 
&quot;hunter cams&quot; that fill the woods, no good solid footprints, no hair 
samples caught on barb wire fences, and no road killed big cats.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That last one showed up, to everyone's astonishment, in Connecticut last 
weekend. The 140-pounder was hit in Milton, Connecticut - not exactly wild 
lands. It is bound to be an escaped pet of some kind.Here's a Reuters story 
about it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If there is any cougar in New Hampshire, it would be a similar solo 
escapee, since no wild population exists closer than the upper Midwest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's&nbsp;my last blog post&nbsp;about cougars, in which I lament the way 
exciting &quot;friend of a friend&quot; reports get less exciting when you 
track them down.&nbsp;Here's a March 6 story of mine&nbsp;(complete with cool 
historical photos) about the designation of the Eastern cougar subspecies as 
extinct.</p>

<p>Bruins v. Canucks is shaping up like the presidential electoral college</p> 
<p>The Bruins have the best logo in sports, I think.</p> 
<p>If the Vancouver Canucks win the 7th game of their series with the Bruins 
by a margin of 11 runs or less, they will take home the Stanley Cup even though 
they scored fewer goals. (At the moment the cumulative score is a whopping 19-7 
in favor of the Bruins, with the series tied at 3 games apiece.)</p> 
<p>That outcome would be dismaying to New England, of course, but it would 
make the series a perfect metaphor for the presidential electoral college, a 
system that makes it possible, as happened in 2000 and three times in the 
1800s),for one person to get more total votes (i.e., score more goals) and yet 
lose the election because they captured fewer important states (i.e., win fewer 
games).</p> 
<p>If you think the electoral college is a bad way to elect presidents, then 
you should also think that counting games won, rather than total goals scored, 
is a bad way to decide the winner of the Stanley Cup, or any multiple-game 
series.</p> 
<p>At least, you should think that way if sports and politics were logical - 
but neither one is, so I suppose this argument is moot.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My vaccine story has drawn no furious rants! Hooray, or maybe not</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A few months ago the Telegraph changed it so that you have to register to 
post a comment on a story, using a valid email address. (We also instituted a 
paywall if you read too many articles per month, but that's another matter.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This policy change has caused the number of comments to plummet, as you 
would expect. Somebody who is unlikely to return to our site (i.e., has no 
connecton to, or interest in, the Nashua area) is unlikely to bother 
registering even though it's free; ergo, virtually all comments now come from 
repeat readers and/or subscribers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is fine by the Telegraph, because the flyby comments had a lousy 
signal-to-noise ratio. They tended to be superficial rants, insulting anybody 
who is different than the writer (different race, different politics, or, 
heaven forbid, living in Massachusetts) or else were echo chambers of 
carbon-copy opinion from far away, made in response to some call to arms by an 
activitist. They almost never added anything of interest, and often swamped the 
good comments so you couldn't find them. No longer.</p> 
<p>I hadn't&nbsp; realized how much of a difference this change made until 
today, however, when I wrote a story about an upcoming public hearing to help 
set federal vaccination policy. (Here's the story) In it, I made no bones&nbsp; 
about how discredited the arguments are that are used by anti-vaccine folks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In past years when I've written such stories they've drawn dozens of 
furious comments ranting that I hate children because they know that somebody's 
kid once got sick several weeks after a shot, which is proof that vaccines 
kill, and besides vaccines have rat poison in them and I'm obviously a biased 
idiot in the pay of Big Pharmam etc. etc. But today's story has no comments, at 
least so far - nary a frenzied rant to wade through in search of actualy 
insight. How refreshing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, no comments also means no intelligent discussion by readers, 
which is too bad. This is an interesting, complicated topic, and I wonder how 
much reader insight we're missing via this registration policy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Alas, nothing's perfect.</p>

<p>New England's life expectancy is high and is rising fast</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A detailed new study of how life expectacy has changed in the U.S. over the 
period 1987-2007 shows New England, and New Hampshire in particular, doing very 
well. Only Coos County in the state's northern tip&nbsp; falls below the 
highest ranking of expectancy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The study also showed, alarmingly, that life expectancy is falling in parts 
of the U.S. - usually poor areas with more minorities - apparently because of 
obesity and other chronic lifestyle conditions linked with poor medical care.

<p>Boston is a champion city - but what about professional chess?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Bruins won the Stanley Cup last night (which ruins the parallel tothe 
electoral college paradox,&nbsp;but such is life) and this means Boston is the 
first U.S. city to have won championships in the four major sports within a 
single decade.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But there are other professional sports in Boston beyond football, 
basketball, baseball and hockey - notably the&nbsp;Boston Blitz, members of 
the&nbsp;U.S. Chess League. They haven't won a title, darn it!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The fact that you didn't even know that a professional team chess 
organization exists is telling, because I've rarely encountered an organization 
that is worse at getting the word out than the U.S. Chess League. I have 
emailed/called the Blitz several times over the years to do a story and they've 
never responded. It's kind of a loose organization, and I don't suppose local 
New Hampshire coverage really matters much, but still!</p>

<p>Maine sees jobs, money in ocean energy</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Portland Press-Herald's Tux Turkel gets right to the point in a story 
today about a conference concerning generating power from the ocean: 
&quot;Maine's basic goal for offshore energy is to produce electricity, but the 
larger potential is to develop the manufacturing capacity to supply ocean 
energy components to the world.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's the &quot;green jobs&quot; idea, which is still in its infancy at 
best. But coastline-rich Maine is wise to pursue it for ocean energy, starting 
with research and development. The story notes &quot;the state is poised to 
test a scale model of a floating offshore wind turbine next summer &hellip;. 
The prototype is meant to test technology ahead of a pilot wind farm in 2017, 
which will have a capacity of roughly 25 megawatts.&quot;</p>

tomorrow evening (Tuesday, June 21, 7 p.m) at The Barley House restaurant in 
downtown Concord. The topic is &quot;The Future of Food&quot; and I hope we'll 
have a good mix of GM food fans, raw food advocates, growers and buyers, 
localvores and localvore skeptics showing up in the audience to talk with our 
three panelists (a professor, an organic farmer and a food buyer for the Common 
Man restaurant chain).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Judging from the first SCNH, on climate change, it will be two hours plus 
of intelligent, polite, informative discussion which actually leaves people 
more knowledgeable instead of just more angry.</p>

<p>Uh-oh - Best Buy is suing to protect &quot;Geek Squad&quot; name</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't suppose Granite Geek will ever rise to the level of their interest, 
but I can't help feeling a&nbsp;<em>frisson&nbsp;</em>of dread when I read that 
Best Buy, owner of the Geek Squad business, is suing companies that have Geek 
in their name, or geek in their advertising.</p>

<p>Why is &quot;5683<strong>&acirc;&#128;&sup3;</strong><strong> a very common 
four-number code?</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boing Boing has a post at the moment pointing to an analysis of four-number 
iPhone lock codes. Nine of the top ten are obvious (0000, 1212, 2580 (the 
central spine of the 10-number phone keyboard), 1111, etc.) &hellip; but one of 
them is 5683. I couldn't figure out why that one is so popular - can you?</p>

<p>State's CFL bulb recycling program ends</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This won't make it any easier to convince the weirdly die-hard 
incandescent-bulb fans to switch, but the state has cut money that supports 
compact fluorescent recycling programs at hardware stores. It's also against 
the law to put them in the garbage, because of the small amount of mercury in 
the base (the electricity coverts mercury to a gas, which leads to the glow, as 
explained in&nbsp;HowStuffWorks), so without recycling, what do you do?&nbsp;
Here's the AP story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One thing you don't do is give up on them in some anti-mercury move, 
because the extra power consumed by wildly inefficient incandescent bulbs 
releases more mercury into the air from coal-burning power plants than exists 
in the CFL bulb, on average -&nbsp;as I noted here.</p>

<p>The best kind of volunteering involves doing something you lenjoy, so you 
get pleasure as well as that lovely feeling of self-righteousness which drives 
most volunteering.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A case in point: This morning at 7:30 I was wading around in the 
crystal-clear Souhegan River, watching the sun glint off the water, the 
songbirds flit and fly, the minnows swim - while collecting water in a glass 
bottle and a little plastic bag, measuring the temperature with a thermomter 
hooked to my ankle, and generally feeling pretty pleased with myself.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I do it as part of the river-quality testing overseen by the Souhegan 
Watershed Association. My family has done it for several years - now that the 
kids are in college and my wife's work schedule has changed, it's up to me. 
Poor me, eh?</p>

<p>Verizon Wireless may end unlimited-data plans</p>

<p>Big North Country wind park gets federal loan guarantee</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A planned 99-megawatt wind farm in Coos County has gotten a conditional 
loan guarantee of $136 million from the U.S. Department of Energy. Such 
guarantees are almost always required for large wind farms to get financing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The proposal, called&nbsp;Granite Reliable Power Windpark&nbsp;and proposed 
a subsidiary of Noble Power, would be about four times the size of Lempster 
Mountain Wind Farm, the only wind farm in the state. Its 33 turbines would 
stretch roughly from Dixville to Dummer. (See&nbsp;my alternative energy map
&nbsp;here for details)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The majority of the power from the project will be sold to Central Vermont 
Public Service and Green Mountain Power, according to an Energy Department 
release. WestLB AG is the lender-applicant for the project, which was submitted 
under the Financial Institution Partnership Program.</p>

<p>Another big turn-out for Science Cafe NH</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We had a good 60 people crowding into the basement of The Barley House last 
night for the second Science Cafe New Hampshire. A whole lot more show up and 
we're going to have space problems.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The topic was &quot;The Future of Food&quot;, featuring UNH professor John 
Carroll, organic farmer Larry Pletcher, and Brandon Miller, chef/food buyer for 
The Common Man restaurants.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The basic theme of the discussion was that locally grown food has exploded 
in the past decade, although there are still big problems with distribution and 
other infrastructure, such as slaughterhouses (a topic&nbsp;I have written 
about in the Telegraph) and large-animal veterinarians. A surprising amount of 
research and technology is behind this &quot;renaissance&quot; of New England 
farming, from high-tunnel growing that extends the season to detailed analysis 
of soil, fertilizer needs and microclimate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the Science Cafe NH page, which includes some &quot;background 
reading&quot; from the panelists, for more information.</p>

<p>The cafe will take the summer off, but returns Sept. 21 with a program on 
vaccines. That might tax the seating capacity of our venue!</p>

<p>Tussle over electric smart meters continues in Maine</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Center Maine Power, the biggest electricity utility in Maine, is spending 
big bucks on expansion of the power grid because it wants to use more wind 
power - Maine is already the Northeast's leader in wind and likely to get 
better. As part of CMP's push it plansa $200 million project to replace 600,000 
mechanical meters with wireless digital versions - &quot;smart meters,&quot; in 
the vernacular - that create a two-way information flow to help it handle the 
flow of power on the grid better.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This idea has been opposed by folks who are suspicious that it will be used 
to increase their rates somehow or carry privacy concerns, which is reasonable, 
and by folks who think the wireless signal will make them sick or do other 
weird stuff, which is not reasonable. Regulators finally said that CMP had to 
let people opt out of wireless meters, but they'd have to pay for the privilege 
because it will raise the company's eventual costs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The town council in Bath has balked at this, and CMP may sue them.Here's a 
Press-Herald story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Speaking of electric power, Slate's Farhad Manjoo has a good, but 
depressing, article about why battery power is unlikely to replace 
gasoline:&nbsp;read it here. A key tidbit: &quot;Today's best lithium-ion 
batteries can hold about 200 watt-hours per kilogram&acirc;&#128;&#148;a 
measure of energy density&acirc;&#128;&#148;and they might theoretically be 
able to store about 400 watt-hours per kilogram. Gasoline has a density 
equivalent of around 13,000 watt-hours per kilogram.&quot;</p>

<p>A little sedan barely misses 300,000 miles, and is so disappointed it burst 
into flame</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We've all had cars with big numbers on the odometer that we were proud of - 
but I doubt I'll ever top the 299,100 that Doug Earl of Fremont, NH, put on his 
Ford Focus. As reported in the Union-Leader today, he missed the triple-century 
by just 900 miles, for a very dramatic reason: The car burst into flame on the 
road.&nbsp;Read the article here, then go gaze at your odometer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Speaking of which, there is no better measure of how much better cars are 
these days than high-mileage vehicles. When I was young it was surprising when 
a car hit 100,000 miles; I had a friend with a picture of the odometer rollover 
in his living room! Now 100,000 is barely the start of middle age.</p>

<p>Granite State Skeptics handed out cold reading &quot;bingo cards&quot; at 
John Edwards talk-to-the-dead show</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Granite State Skeptics put together an intriguing method of informing 
the public about a bit of hooh-hah - a few of them gathered outside the Palace 
Theater in Manchester on Tuesday night before the start of the show of John 
Edwards, whose shtick is &quot;communicating with the dead,&quot; and handed 
out &quot;bingo cards&quot; for cold-reading terms, plus material explaining 
how cold reading works.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There were no confrontations, probably not a lot of minds changed (when 
you've shelled out $120 for a show, it takes a lot for you to say &quot;you're 
right - I'm being fooled!&quot;). But it&nbsp; is a notable example of how to 
educate, rather than annoy, the public.</p>

<p>Next &quot;content provider&quot; to face the digital dilemma: Comic books
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Its been a looooong time since I read any comic books - not since John 
Romita's stint at Spider-Man, and I mean&nbsp;Romita Senior&nbsp;- but I enjoy 
keeping track of the industry as a weird microcosm of the whole 
entertainment/information/media universe. So it was intriguing to see that DC 
Comics is going to a digital delivery model, selling digital versions on the 
same day that print versions go on sale. Not surprisingly, this has some stores 
worried.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Heres a Globe story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story includes the sort of comments about value of real-world vs. 
digital-world interaction that retailers have been saying for years 
(&quot;Customers value the interaction of coming to a store, the ambiance. 
We're definitely geek or nerd centers. People want to find out what's cool . . 
. If we didn't exist, they wouldn't have that.&quot;) but I'm dubious. I quoted 
storefront travel agents saying that sort of thing in the 1990s, and it didn't 
seem to help them much.</p>

WikNic, a Wikipeidan picnic. As of the moment only a few people have signed up 
(as you can see&nbsp;here), but still -&nbsp; where else could you go to make 
&quot;citation needed&quot; jokes?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Alas, I've already signed up to do work on hiking trails in my town, or I'd

<p>How many of our legislators have college degrees? The answer's not so simple
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Union-Leader does a nice job today examining a much-publicized report 
by the Chronicle of Higher Education about the precentage of New Hampshire 
legislators who have college degrees. The CHE report said New Hampshire was the 
lowest in the country in terms of percentage of legislators with an associate 
degree or higher, although it qualified the statement because information about 
educational attainment for a large number of our huge Statehouse body wasn't 
online.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Union-Leader looked at data from the so-called Blue Book, in which 
legislators record facts about themselves, and found that New Hampshire isn't 
the worst, it's just in the bottom 10.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the Union-Leader article.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the original CHE report, with an interactive map. Playing with the 
map finds something interesting: Our legislature is well above average in the 
precentage of lawmakers with doctoral degrees.</p>

<p>Innumeracy in writers (cords of wood, in this case)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's sweet when you catch someone else in a gross error in math. Not so 
great when someone catches me in such a trap.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm reading &quot;At Home&quot; by Bill Bryson. This is a book that follows 
the historical development of houses from pre-history to the present time. It's 
very well written with lots of interesting facts thrown in about everything 
from servant rules to the Erie Canal being the event that created New York City 
and American Commerce.&nbsp;But in the chapter on the cellar, he really screws 
up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bryson correctly states that the average colonial house required 15 to 20 
cords of wood a year for heating and cooking. Then he goes on to say that would 
require a stack of wood 80 feet high, 80 feet wide and 160 feet long. 
Unfortunately, that works out to be 8000 cords or 400 times more than the real 
dimensions of 4 feet high, 4 feet wide and 160 feet long.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's pretty easy when dealing with unfamiliar materials or dimensional 
factors to not realize you could be so far wrong. The author obviously doesn't 
use wood for heating and has probably never been around a woodpile with a given 
quantity of wood in it. A cord of wood isn't something that is easy to 
visualize. We who cut, stack and move wood for our winter warmth have a much 
more intimate feeling of just how massive this investment in personal energy 
can be.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I see this innumeracy a lot when comparing astronomical distances to 
earthly measurements. To say that the sun is 93,000,000 miles away or is 
864,000 miles in diameter is completely meaningless to us ordinary people. On 
the other end of the measurement spectrum, a micron, a millionth of a meter is 
also without real meaning to us. Yet these numbers are important. Integrated 
circuits are getting down to the few micron size. We are approaching the point 
where individual atoms are parsed out with instruments unimaginable a few scant 
years ago. Light years to microns, we throw these units around as if we really 
have a feeling for them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I can forgive Bill Bryson for his (and his editors) lapse in using the 
wrong values for a cord of wood. I would be no better than he in discussing 
ancient measuring systems for Greek amphoras, those odd shaped vessels used to 
ship wine.</p>

<p>A smart grid in action: 20 percent less use for more production</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The huge IBM plant in Essex Junction, Vt., near Burlington, has turned its 
electricity service into a two-way &quot;smart grid&quot; and says this has 
helped the plant cut power use 20 percent while increasing production.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of couse, it's a lot easier to make a smart grid inside a facility owned by 
a single firm than across a city or state - a benign dictator is always more 
efficient than a democracy - so the lessons to the wide world are limited. 
Still, its interesting to see the extent of savings that just improving the 
grid can provide.</p>

<p>Arrival of DSL ends homemade ISP in tiny NH town</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today talks about digital changes in the tiny border 
town of Mason (population about 1500). One is that it led to the end of a 
homemade ISP - a guy paid for a T1 line to his home and stuck a WiFi-ish 
antenna on the tower he had for his ham radio, selling service to 16 people; 
&quot;The biggest problem was occasionally having to chastise somebody who 
hogged the bandwidth with excessive peer-to-peer-network use.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The other change is that it is contributing to the demise of the volunteer 
town Web site,&nbsp;which you can see here&nbsp;if you'd like a bit of 
nostalgia back to Mozilla days.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the column.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Is the 60-cycle power grid likely to slip (and make your oven clock be 
wrong)?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The&nbsp;Knight Science Journalism Tracker&nbsp;pointed me to an 
interesting story: The feds are going to experiment with letting electricity 
utilities slip further than normal from 60 cycles for AC current. The 
difference is unlikely to be noticed - except in some electronic clocks, which 
use 60-cycles-per-second as their digital tick-tock.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Egad! What if your TV didn't start recording a show on time! Egad! Egad!!
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the AP story.&nbsp;From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No one is quite sure what will be affected. This won't change the clocks in 
cellphones, GPS or even on computers, and it won't have anything to do with 
official U.S. time or Internet time. But wall clocks and those on ovens and 
coffeemakers &acirc;&#128;&#148; anything that flashes &quot;12:00<em>
&acirc;&#128;&sup3;</em><em> when it loses power &acirc;&#128;&#148; may be 
just a bit off every second, and that error can grow with time.</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not easy figuring what will run fast and what won't. For example, VCRs 
or DVRs that get their time from cable systems or the Internet probably won't 
be affected, but those with clocks tied to the electric current will be off a 
bit, Matsakis said.</p>

<p>An advertising campaign with lots of graphic sex that's aimed at monkeys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's no New England angle to this story, but I can't resist: New 
Scientist reports that a primatologist at Yale's&nbsp;Comparative Cognition Lab
&nbsp;(hey - there's a New England angle!) is studying whether billboards can 
affect the behavior of captive brown capuchin monkeys, which often behave in 
human-ish ways. They'll &quot;pitch&quot; two similar foods (probably 
different-colored Jell-o) with big pictures. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One billboard shows a graphic shot of a female monkey with her genitals 
exposed, alongside the brand A logo. The other shows the alpha male of the 
capuchin troop associated with brand A. Olwell expects brand A to be the 
capuchins' favoured product. &quot;Monkeys have been shown in previous studies 
to really love photographs of alpha males and shots of genitals, and we think 
this will drive their purchasing habits.&quot;side the brand A logo. The other 
shows the alpha male of the capuchin troop associated with brand A.</p>

<p>Fish &amp; Wildlife reports how climate change is affecting each of the 50 
states (ticks and moose for us)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service has been running a series of articles, 
one for each state, highlighting adverse effects of &quot;increasing climate 
change&quot; (wow - a government agency that doesn't mince words!). Topics 
include stress on pelicans in North Dakota, streams in Oklahoma, and Walden 
Pond in Massachusetts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For New Hampshire, the item concerned ticks and moose. It notes that study 
a state study from 2001-2006 &quot;found winter ticks accounted for 41 percent 
of all moose deaths in the state over a five-year period. That was nearly the 
same percentage of collared moose killed by hunting and moose-vehicle 
collisions combined. Virtually all the calf deaths during the study were due to 
winter ticks.&quot; The problem? Warmer winters kill off fewer ticks, making 
moose more vulnerable: &quot;If there's no snow on the ground in March or 
April, engorged female ticks that fall off moose survive to lay their eggs in 
June. That produces a larger tick population in the fall when they are ready to 
quest again. Warmer temperatures and less snow in the fall means the ticks can 
continue questing for a longer period of time, infecting moose at a higher 
rate.&quot;</p>

<p>GPS interference concerns raised in N.H. by national 4G proposal</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A proposal by a company called LightSquared to create a whole 4G-LTE 
network that combines wired and satellite transmission over what's known as the 
L Band has a lot of people up in arms. They are worried about interference with 
the GPS spectrum, which is adjacent to the L Band. The company needs an FCC 
waiver to build out the ground-tower portion of the network, which has rallied 
the federal lobbying troops on both sides of the issue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't know much about this, but am heading up to Concord this morning to 
attend a press conference and become an instant expert, or at least the 
journalism equivalent of one. The conference is being held by one of our 
congressman, Charlie Bass, with thehead of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Association, several other New Hampshire airport folks, a representative of New 
Hampshire Fish and Game, which is worried about interference with back-country 
rescue work, and the state's broadband director, Carol Miller (known to many

<p>Smart grid, including meters, get voter OK in Burlington, Vt.</p>

<p>The city of Burlington has approved a plan for a &quot;smart grid&quot; in 
the city even though it will cost $13.5 million and will involve at least some 
wireless meters that have drawn some opposition in Maine. The major concerns, 
judging from the Burlington Free-Press story (read it here), were financial 
rather than technical, but they were overcome by the belief that upgrading the 
&quot;dumb pipes&quot; of the current power grid is a necessary step to holding 
down rates in the long term.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the story: &quot;The vote fast-tracks negotiations with vendors, which 
might begin installing meters, sensors and communication gear by the end of the 
year.&quot;</p>

and safety glass. This is part of the process for melding standards used in 
aircraft and in autos. Here's&nbsp;a quick item from Mass High Tech.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The MHT article doesn't mention that&nbsp;Terrafugia&nbsp;announced a 
couple weeks ago that it was pushing back its roll-out schedule&nbsp;because it 
had &quot;encountered a number of the challenges that are common in aircraft 
development programs, including problems with third party suppliers.&quot; 
First delivery date is now &quot;late 2012.&quot;</p>

<p>The Union-Leader has a refreshingly realistic story about a couple of small 
(under 3 on the Richter scale) &acirc;&#128;&#152;quakes that were recorded 
near Gilmanton yesterday. Realistic, because nobody felt them, and the paper 
didn't fall into the TV-news trap of trying to make the event seem dramatic 
regardless of the circumstances.</p>

<p>NH is getting warmer, along with the US as a whole</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The &quot;average&quot; temperature in New Hampshire was about half a 
degree Fahrenheit warmer in the 1981-2010 period than in the 1971-2000 period, 
according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. That's 
roughly the same amount that temperatures have risen in the U.S. as a whole - 
compared to places like the Upper Midwest, which saw the average go up by twice 
as much. The Southeast U.S. saw the smallest rise over that period, although 
it's still a rise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NOAA establishes these 30-year norms to compare annual temperature swings, 
and updates them each decade.</p>

<p>Is this the end of the Space Age?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Economist magazine has a cover story arguing that the final launch of 
the Space Shuttle marks the end of the Space Age, because the cost and 
difficulty of doing anything with humans even as close as Mars is far greater 
than any reward that most people value.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They argue that private ventures like SpaceX won't ever get beyond 
low-Earth orbit to any meaningful extent, and that China and and India will 
quickly reach the same conclusion as the US and Russia about the cost/benefit 
ratio of manned flight, since they don't even have a Cold War to spur them on. 
From the article:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The heroic phase of space exploration, with chiselled-jawed astronauts 
venturing where no man has gone before, inspiring schoolchildren and defending 
democracy (or socialism), is now a thing of the past. Mr Obama's plan may 
revitalise NASA and send American astronauts into the solar system once again. 
But the agency's history as a political football suggests it is unlikely.</p>

<p>Creationism trying to sneak into New Hampshire laws</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On this Independence Day, let us celebrate academic independence by noting 
with disapproval that two New Hampshire lawmakers want to bring creationism 
into public school science classes. as I note in my telegraph column (which ran 
yesterday, because we don't have a paper on July 4), two possible bills may 
come up in the fall to get creatonism into the classroom. One would mandate 
teaching &quot;intelligent design&quot;, the other would mandate teaching 
evolution &quot;as a theory&quot;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Both lawmakers agree there are theological/philosophical elements to their 
proposals - one wants to examine how much atheism is being the push for 
evolution in classes; the other is concerned by the lack of a deeper meaning in 
evolution. I argue in the column that evolution, linking us to the 
understandable reality of the universe, has more meaning that an arbitrary 
creation by some other-worldly being or beings, but I also note that the 
argument is irelevant: Science classes should teach science.</p>

<p>Watching a dozen fireworks displays at once from Temple Mountain</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm not a big fireworks fan, so last night, instead of swatting mosquitos 
and waiting in traffic to watch a display, I went up Temple Mountain with my 
wife and a friend, to see how many displays we could watch at once.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We saw a dozen, although some were barely visilbe through the trees (Temple 
isn't like Mount Mondanock with its 360-degree clear views); we also could hear 
what I assume was Peterborough's display, but couldn't see it because the hill 
blocked it. Many of the displays were tiny, of course - they might as well have 
been colorful fireflies - but it was fun.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It was an incredibly gorgeous night, too; warm breeze keeping away the 
mosquitos. Sometimes things just work out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We were on the former ski area that is now a state-owned recreation area, 
traversed by the Wapack Trail. If you're ever looking for a nice day hike in 
southern N.H., consider it.</p>

<p>Renewable energy (mostly wood, hydropower) passes nuclear power in US</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Renewable energy sources - much of it large-scale hydropower, but also 
geothermall, biomass (burning wood), solar and wind), generated 2.245 
quadrillion Btus of energy, or 11.7 percent of U.S. energy production, 
according tothis report from DomesticFuel.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>During this same time period, renewable energy production surpassed nuclear 
energy power by 5.65 percent. In total, energy produced from renewables is 
77.15 percent of that from domestic crude oil production.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This isn't quite as much of a change as it seems, since virtually all the 
hydropower and much of the wood-burning power has existed for years. Still, 
it's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Final shuttle takes off on schedule</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UPDATE: It went off on time!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As of right now (6:30 a.m.), there's a 70 percent change of thunderstorms 
in mid-Florida, so Atlantis is unlikely to launch in five hours as scheduled. 
But you never know.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the official NASA shuttle page</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Memories of a UNH satellite as the shuttle ends</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From David Sims at UNH News Service:</p> 
<p>DURHAM, N.H. &acirc;&#128;&#147; When the Space Shuttle Atlantis lifts off 
from Florida's Kennedy Space Center this Friday morning for its final voyage, 
it will bring to a close the ship's 27-year flight history, the 30-year run of 
the shuttle program itself, and a chapter of space science history at the 
University of New Hampshire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Space scientists and technicians from the UNH Space Science Center (SSC) 
were key members of the team that built the Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) 
onboard the 17-ton Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) that was lofted into 
space and placed into orbit by Atlantis astronauts back in 1991. The second of 
NASA's Great Observatories, at the time the science satellite was the heaviest 
astrophysical payload ever placed in orbit by a shuttle, and the delicate 
operation ended up requiring an unplanned spacewalk to fully deploy the 
observatory.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The observatory had a high-gain antenna on a deployable boom,&quot; 
recalls Professor Mark McConnell of the SSC and department of physics and who 
spent the first 15 years of his career at UNH working on COMPTEL. &quot;But 
when the shuttle's robotic arm lifted CGRO out of the payload bay the boom got 
stuck and two astronauts were sent out to yank it free and deploy the antenna. 
Had that not been possible, the science mission would have been severely 
compromised,&quot; McConnell adds.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>During its operation from 1991 to 2000, when it was deorbited by NASA, the 
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory explored the high-energy sky looking at some of 
the most violent and energetic processes in the universe, including black 
holes, solar flares, gamma-ray bursts, and pulsars. It also mapped out sites 
where all of the heavier elements in the periodic table are created, a process 
known as nucleosynthesis, which is detected by regions of strong radioactive 
emissions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Says McConnell, &quot;The universe started out with just hydrogen and 
helium and everything else came from the interiors of stars and supernovae. 
That process of creating heavier elements in supernovae in particular generates 
or creates a lot of radioactivity, and we were able to measure that with 
COMPTEL.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That measurement was made possible by the detection of gamma rays from the 
far reaches of our galaxy. Such detection is only possible above Earth's 
atmosphere and by means of large, heavy detectors such as CGRO because gamma 
rays are highly energetic and require a lot of mass to stop them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Plus, there aren't that many of them out there,&quot; McConnell said, 
&quot;it's a very difficult measurement to make.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The COMPTEL experiment was headed up at UNH by Professor Jack Lockwood 
until his retirement, at which point Professor James Ryan took over as the 
principal investigator. SSC scientists and engineers who worked for years on 
the COMPTEL experiment and who remain at UNH include Ryan, McConnell, John 
Macri, Stan Ellis, and Tom Milliman.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UNH also had a legacy with the space shuttle Challenger, which performed 
the very first on-orbit satellite repair for the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM or 
SolarMax). Launched on February 14, 1980, SolarMax carried several scientific 
instruments that provided new insights into the nature of solar flares, 
including a gamma-ray spectrometer experiment led by Edward Chupp, currently 
professor emeritus at the SSC.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>McConnell notes that COMPTEL was the first gamma-ray detector of its kind 
to fly in space. Over a nine-year period it picked up signals from just two 
dozen stars in the entire sky.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;So what we need to do is make instruments that are more sensitive and 
that can probe weaker sources in the sky. If we can get to a point where we're 
seeing hundreds or thousands of sources in sky, then we can start doing more 
science to broaden the understanding of the way the universe works.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UNH space scientists and engineers are currently working on projects toward 
that eventual goal. A significant milestone will be reached this summer with a 
balloon test flight of a small prototype instrument based on what was learned 
from COMPTEL.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Fast Compton Telescope or FACTEL for short will be flown out of New 
Mexico. The principal investigator for FACTEL is Jim Ryan, with McConnell as 
co-investigator and SSC research assistant professor Peter Bloser, research 
project engineer Jason Legere, and graduate student Manuel Jullian also 
involved in the project.</p>

<p>Verizon Wireless opens lab to develop 4G services</p>

out what sort of services (streaming music? Internet-connected refrigerators? 
self-driving package-delivery drones controlled by your cell phone?) it can 
make and sell without overloading its network.It will be unveiled tomorrow; I 
have a press invite but don't think I can make it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The bigger immediate news, of course is that the service is joining others 
in instituting a data cap. AP has a good story about the sort of decisions 
customers are going to have to make about usage:Read it here. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And speaking of bandwidth limits, Mass High Tech has a good piece looking 
at the way they are affecting various companies who sell services online or 
otherwise depend on lots of bandwidth. Among its points: &quot;What many people 
don't realize is that the available bandwidth problem is being compounded by 
the rapid growth of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications that use wireless 
technology as all or part of its communication process &acirc;&#128;&#148; 
things such as remote equipment relaying status updates to a home office and 
truck fleets transmitting location and condition reports.&quot; Read it here.

<p>My Telegraph column today talks about a really cool new program started by 
the state, in which they sign up people who have swimming pools and ask them to 
identify all the bugs that are caught in the filter each week. The idea is to 
help spot invasive insects - particularly the dreaded Asian longhorn beetle - 
as they sneak into the state.</p>

<p>Save endangered mudpuppies or battle invasive lampreys - a Vermont quandary
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nobody said being an environmentalist was easy. Vermont is demonstrating 
that right now, because attempts to save the endangered mudpuppy, a 
river-bottom-dwelling salamander, are colliding with attempts to get rid of sea 
lampreys, a fish-destroying nuisance species. From the Burlington Free-Press:
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mudpuppies share the river bottom with larval sea lampreys, perhaps 
Vermont's least popular species. As adults, lamprey prey on popular gamefish in 
Lake Champlain. The state and federal governments are committed to killing 
lamprey by applying pesticides to rivers in the Champlain basin where they 
spend their early years. Mudpuppies die as collateral damage, sometimes in 
large numbers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lampreys aren't invasives, but their population has exploded, due probably 
to pollution and other man-made changes to the ecosystem</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Why does sea salt build up on power lines?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The NY Times has a big story about the drought affecting much of the South, 
and I was surprised by this item:</p> 
<p>In Texas, some cities are experiencing blackouts because airborne deposits 
of salt and chemicals are building up on power lines, triggering surges that 
shut down the system. In times of normal weather, rain usually washes away the 
environmental buildup. Instead, power company crews in cities like Houston are 
being dispatched to spray electrical lines.</p> 
<p>So far as I can tell, the salt some from sea air, which builds up on 
insulators, eventually conducting electricity where it shouldn't go. So I guess 
this could be a problem if there was a long drought on our Seacoast, as well.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sunscreen Information</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the time of year when applying sunscreen is most important. Some of 
us can't stand to be inside in the shop when the weather is so nice outside. 
But, as we are continually told, too much sun can be a problem. The usual 
protection methods of wearing clothing to cover up (too hot!) or slapping on 
sunscreen (messy!) can be inconvenient.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The best information compilation I've seen in quite a while on sunscreen 
confusion is posted on the Information is Beautiful website.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Everyone should take a look at this to cut through the advertising hype and 
get to the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>A &quot;makerspace&quot; opens in Nashua - lots of tools, lots of goofiness
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a profile in the Telegraph today of Make It Labs, a new 
&quot;makerspace&quot; that has opened in an industrial part of Nashua, next to 
the railyards.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm not a handy guy - my wife is the tool-wielding primate in our household 
- but I found the place an irresistible mix of hacker playfulles and workshop 
practicality. It's enough to make me pick up a soldering iron and/or welding 
torch, and see how long it takes me to hurt myself. They've got an open house 
every Monday and Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Here's the story. Here's their Web site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If the trash can is tiny, you think twice about throwing stuff away</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When staff at Dartmouth College were given tiny trash cans - I've seen 
Slurpee cups that are bigger - to handle their non-recyclable materials, they 
reduced the amount of stuff they sent to the landfill by 200 tons. The move was 
part of a sustainability program at the university that takes advantage 
of&nbsp; human nature rather than technology: &quot;The point of the program is 
to make trash even more personal by asking people to ponder just how much 
they're throwing out,&quot; says&nbsp;this New York Times blog post.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I remember being astonished at how little stuff ended up in the family 
trash can when our town started recycling paper, several years ago. I couldn't 
believe how much of our trash volume had been envelopes and newspapers and the 
like.</p>

<p>Our Januarys are getting warmer, our Julys not so much</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>January is getting warmer in New Hampshire, but July might be getting 
slightly cooler, according to new data by National Oceanographic and 
Atmospheric Administration. NOAA recalculated the 30-year &quot;normal&quot; 
temperatures around the country for each month, based on data from the first 
decade of this millennium, and found that the January minimums had risen in 
much of the country, including N.H., whereas the July maximums hadn't risen as 
much, and have gone down slightly in New England</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>On a statewise basis, our annual low temperatures are rose by more than 
half a degree in a decade, while our annual high temperatures rose by perhaps a 
quarter of a degree. This means that we don't have to worry about summers 
becoming brutal as much as we have to worry about winters becoming wimpy.</p>

<p>Morse Code lives, at least for one night (.... -- .-. .--.-)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On Tuesday, three marine broadcast stations - none in the Northeast, alas - 
participated in an annual Morse Code broadcast event sponsored by the non-profit
Maritime Radio Historical Society (whose Web site has a very cool masthead 
design). The event is nostalgic, but also taps into a lingering fear among the 
emergency-communications community that the time will come when we'll be sorry 
we forgot Morse Code, which is the most robust long-distance communications 
form ever invented.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If a hurricane destroys all the power line,s cell phone towers and phone 
lines, you can still send dits and dahs using a battery, a few connections, and 
a wire antenna tossed over a tree limb.&nbsp; As long as there's somebody who 
understands it, of course.</p> 
<p>Here's an NY Times story about the event.</p>

<p>Northeast Link power line map</p> 
<p>A 200-mile gigawatt power line that will be buried? Well, maybe</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>News came out earlier this week that a couple of utility companies want to 
build a roughly 1-gigawatt high voltage DC power line from mid Maine, down the 
coast to eastern Massachusetts, to carry energy from Maine's wind farms as well 
as hydro and nuclear power in eastern Canada.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The really interesting thing is that they proposal to bury it rather than 
string it on towers. One of the groups opposed to the similarNorthern Pass 
proposal wants that line buried, but its owners say the idea is too expensive 
and outlandish to even study. Northern Pass would build about 40 miles of new 
lines through pristine northern N.H. forests before joining an existing 
right-of-way, all to bring a gigawatt of Quebec hydopower down to New England,
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Burying high-voltage lines is a problem with AC power because of 
temperature buildup and other issues, but it works well with high-voltage DC. 
At least, it works well in theory, because I'm darned if I can find any 
examples of long-distance high-voltage DC that have actually been buried, 
except for underwater cables. There's lots of talk about it,</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>and designs for various containment pipes, but if anybody has actually 
built one as an alternative to stringing lines on towers, I'd love to hear 
about it. (The similar-sized HVDCChamplain Hudson Power Express, a proposed 
power line from Canada to New York City, plans to be buried in railroad rights 
of way for 73 miles, but most of the way it will laid underwater.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for the new Maine-to-Mass. plan, called Northeast Energy Link, it seems 
a little premature to label it as a buried line. So far the owners have only 
applied to the feds for approval of their funding approach. A spokesman 
responded to my query about rights-of-way and construction/financial details by 
saying that NEL &quot;is in the&nbsp;very early stages of development and as 
you know is being proposed as an underground, high voltage direct-current line, 
but the project isn't yet far enough along to get into the&nbsp;details on 
trenching, etc.</p>

a nice way to get on the river on a hot day and feel virtuous. It'sa nasty,

<p>Dollar coins are great</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't understand the reluctance of the american public to use the 'gold' 
dollar coins that the government is minting in great quantities. I buy them 
from the bank, usually four rolls at a time. They are great for tolls and 
restaurent tips. They also work better than bills in vending machines. Still 
I'm amazed at how many people tell me that they've never received these coins 
before even though they've been out for several years. I just know that they 
are going to wind up in their kids piggy banks so are effectively out of 
circulation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In all my travels, I've used the Canadian loonies (and twonies), the New 
Zealand kiwis, the English pound coins and the Euro coins in Spain. These coins 
are so much handier than dragging out my wallet, sorting through similar 
looking paper currency and then receiving another handful of change to go into 
the pocket.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I was in the Navy, we would sometimes be paid in two dollar bills, 
usually when the local populace grumbled about all those military people 
creating problems in town. As soon as they saw all those rare bills being 
circulated, the objections just went away. Perhaps we need to do something like 
that to get these coins in circulation. A big business like Walmart or Target 
could pass these out for some limited time instead of bills for 
change.&nbsp;Still, I've had people strongly object to receiving them. A friend 
works in a yogurt shop. He doesn't have a dedicated drawer for the coins so its 
an inconvenience for him. Is that common? I should ask.</p>

<p>Some of N.E.'s commercial airports rely on subsidies to keep service</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lebanon in New Hampshire, Rutland in Vermont. and four airports in Maine 
are among the small airports around the country where carriers get a federal 
subsidy to keep commercial service going. Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode 
Island have none;here's the list, in PDF form.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I found this out about this Essential Air Service Program because of an NY 
Times story about how Delta wants to cut service to 24 small townsin the 
Midwest, including South Dakota's capital, Pierre (which is almost as small as 
airport-less Montpelier) unless its subsidies are boosted. (Story here) The 
subsidies are set to end in 2013 unless Congress extends them, and these days 
Congress isn't doing a whole lot.</p>

<p>And speaking of flying, do pilots prefer to fly Boeing or Airbus? Patrick 
Smith of Salon says &quot;there aren't two camps of pilot out there, with one 
that swears by the Boeing camp and another loyal to Airbus. Sure, a pilot might 
prefer one over the other, but it's probably just a case of whatever he or she 
is used to.&quot; Check outhis coumn here.</p>

<p>Vermont Yankee has an interesting deicison to make about refueling</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A judge has rejected Vermont Yankee's attempt to put the question of its 
future on hold while it sues the state of Vermont, which wants it to shut when 
its license runs out next March. (Seestory about judge's ruling here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This leaves it with a problem, as the NY Times notes: It is scheduled to 
shut in October and load up with 18 months of fuel. If it buys all that fuel 
and then is shut down, it has a problem; if it doesn't buy more fuel then it 
might not be able to last until March, no matter what. As if nuclear 
engineering wasn't complicated enough</p>

<p>Reddit cofounder hacked into MIT to set free 4 million scientific papers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The cofounder of Reddit and fellow at Harvard's University's Center for 
Ethics alleged hacked into MIT to &quot;free&quot; 4 million scientific papers 
fromJSTOR, which provides access to a gazilion journals and papers from 
subscriber research institutions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As reported by the Globe, &quot;Aaron Swartz, 24, was charged with wire 
fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected 
computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer. He faces up to 35 years 
in prison and a $1 million fine.&quot; The Globe says that MIT already settled 
this with Swartz, oddly enough.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the story (read the whole thing here):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Swartz allegedly broke into a computer wiring closet in a basement at MIT 
to access MIT's network without authorization from a computer switch within 
that closet. The access allowed him to download materials from JSTOR, a 
non-profit archive of scientific journals and academic work. Authorities allege 
Swartz hacked into the system to distribute JSTOR's archives through 
file-sharing sites.</p>

<p>Bike-sharing program set to begin in Boston</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm dubious as to whether bicycle usage can really reduce the use of 
motorized vehicles in this country, but there's no doubt that the rage for 
bicycle-sharing programs is cool. One is coming to Boston soon (Globe story here
) and I'll have to go down and try it out, although I'm a lousy bicyclist and 
have never biked in the city.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'd love to see them start a program for sharing electric bikes - that 
would be fun.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some folks, like D.C. and Paris, have really embraced the programs - but I 
suspect they're mostly used by tourists and/or for novelty rides, not actual 
transportation. That's just a guess, though.New York City may launch a program,

<p>The Chevy Volt hasn't made it to N.H. yet, although you can order one 
through some local dealers if you don't mind waiting a few months for delivery.

<p>Today's geek/crime lesson: Don't 'wardrive' if the cops are looking for you
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From Saturday's Telegraph:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A 23-year-old Merrimack man's search for free Internet service earned him a 
trip to jail early Friday morning.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Merrimack Police were called to Mallard Point Road around 1:30 a.m. Friday 
for the report of a suspicious vehicle. The caller had noticed a small red SUV 
parked in the area and remembered seeing it driving slowly around the 
neighborhood earlier, police said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Police located the 1999 red Chevy Tracker parked on the side of the road, 
and Kevin Illsley, 23, last known address of 10 Drake Lane, was inside using an 
unsecured wireless network to surf the Web on his phone, police said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Officers conducted a record check and learned the Illsley was wanted on a 
bench warrant for failing to appear at Nashua's district court on a 
controlled-drug charge, police said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Illsley was arrested and held at the Merrimack Police Department on $1,000 
cash bail, and was expected to be arraigned at Merrimack's district court on 
Friday, police said.</p>

<p>I've never seen preferred parking for hybrids and LEVs (LEVs?) before</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a story in the Telegraph (read it here) about the new state liquor 
store in town, which has prominent parking signs close to the front door saying 
&quot;Hybrid/LEV Vehicles Only&quot;. (Actually, they wrote it all in caps, so 
it reads like it should be Hybrid/Lev Vehicles Only, but I don't think there 
are any cars named after the former currency of Belgium.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I hadn't seen preferred parking for hybrids around here before, although it 
seems it has existed for a couple of years under the LEED building program. I'm 
not sure how you know whether your car is a Low-Emission Vehicle (not 
&quot;light electricity vehicle&quot;, as I thought). Do they give you a gold 
star or something?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The comments on the story are mostly of the &quot;fie on arrogant 
eco-snobs!&quot; category.</p>

<p>Vermont Yankee will refuel, despite uncertainty over its future</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Despite the uncertainty about whether the state of Vermont will allow it to 
continue operating past March, the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant's owner, 
New Orleans-based Entergy Corp., says it will spend $60 million to refuel the 
plant. (AP story here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The feds have already given an OK for its license to be extended another 20 
years past the end of its license, so this decision may be an indication that 
the company is confidence Vermont will come around, too. Vermont is the only 
state which must give the OK for relicensing of nuclear plants within its 
borders; for everybody else, only the federal government needs to say OK.</p>

<p>N.H. firm's facial-recognition software popular with police</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Animetrics, a Conway, N.H.-based firm, has algorithms for turning 2D photos 
of faces into 3D software objects to aid facial recognition searches. The 
system is part of a system that lets law enforcement turn smartphones into 
facial scanners. (Article here by Singularity Hub) The system, combined with 
iris scanners, was developed to identify inmates in large prisons so they 
couldn't sneak away, but will soon be seen on a street near you. Another stake 
in the heart of anonymity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Animetrics says its system &quot;is designed to accommodate images where 
the yaw rotation of the face (rotation about the vertical, or y-axis) is +/- 45 
degrees or as long as both eyes are visible in the image plane. Animetrics90 
implements 2D-3D normalization through the generation of the 3D model for every 
image processed by the system. The 3D model is generated through the use of an 
a priori mathematical model of faces generally, advanced image analysis and 
feature extraction, and advanced techniques for deriving precise pose (or 
rotation) estimates from an input image.</p>

<p>Another thing the Internet has demolished: Pop music charts</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a kid, I used to love reading the weekly &quot;top singles&quot; chart 
in our local newspaper (the now-defunct Washington Star - this was 
pre-Watergate, when the Post and Star were neck and neck). It listed the top 10 
singles for a half dozen local radio stations, and since this was when in the 
early British Invasion, when the whole pop-music scene was exploding, my 
pre-pubescent self was fascinated to compare how the different stations ranked 
&quot;Hard Days Night&quot; vs. &quot;Satisfaction&quot; vs. &quot;I Get 
Around.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That pleasure is denied today's youth, though, because the fracturing of 
the Net business means sales charts don't mean much - as the Washington Post 
(not Star!)reports here. It seems a bunch of startups are trying to be 
Billboard 2.0, mixing sales figure with various vague social-media and/or 
download parameters: &quot;The Ultimate Chart tracks how music is shared, 
streamed and purchased across more than 100 different platforms, with each 
outlet weighted by its perceived importance. Sales matter the most. Buying a 
full album on iTunes or in physical form affects the Ultimate Chart much more 
dramatically than streaming a song on Pandora.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But as the article says: &quot;The future of these emerging charts may 
hinge on whether they can draw a meaningful line between buzz and 
commerce.&quot;</p>

<p>A highway marker for New Hampshire's UFO-abduction pioneers</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources and other cultural 
groups have installed one of those historical markers opposite the &quot;Indian 
Head&quot; formation in North Lincoln, commemorating the time that Betty and 
Barney Hill were abducted by UFO aliens. This was the first such report ever to 
go public, and despite its rather (shall we say) unusual nature, the whole 
weird story has entered Granite State lore to the point that the Hills papers 
are kept at UNH for study.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here is the wording on the plaque:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the night of September 19-20, 1961, Portsmouth, N.H. couple Betty and 
Barney Hill experienced a close encounter with an unidentified flying object 
and two hours of &quot;lost&quot; time while driving south on Rte 3 near 
Lincoln. They filed an official Air Force Project Blue Book report of a 
brightly-lit cigar-shaped craft the next day, but were not public with their 
story until it was leaked in the Boston Traveler in 1965. This was the first 
widely-reported UFO abduction report in the United States.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's an excellent blog post about the process of getting the plaque, 
written by Kathleen Marden, who is the Hills' neice and has become their most 
public advocate. (She frequently tweaks the wikipedia article about the 
abduction, for example.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a link to the UNH collection of the Hill's papers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nearby Indian Head Resort, which knows a good thing when it sees it, is is 
holding an event Sept. 23-25 to mark the 50th anniversary of the 
&quot;abduction&quot;, hosted by Marden. It will include a guided tour of the 
route the Hills took.</p>

<p>Mountain lion killed in Conn. had walked there from South Dakota</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DNA testing indicates that the mountain lion killed by a car in Connecticut 
last month indicates that it was from a wild population in South Dakota and - 
here's the amazing part - appears to have traveled by itself, since its DNA 
matched that of a cat which traveled through Wisconsin and Minnesota. The state 
environmental agency said this is the longest distance a mountain lion has been 
known to travel,according to this story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When the mountain lion's body was found, officials assumed it was an 
escapee from an illegal private zoo.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The fact that a wild cat traveled 1,500 miles raises hopes of people who 
think they've seen mountain lions (a.k.a. cougars or panthers) in New 
Hampshire. There are no official populations of these big cats east of 
Illinois, although they are slowly moving in our direction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have written about mountain lions and local lack thereof a few times, 
most recently after the subspecies Eastern Mountain Lion was declared 
officially extinct (read it here). After all such stories I get lots of emails, 
calls or Web postings declaring that somebody or other hass definitely seen a 
mountain lion hereabouts; I have chased down several of the more promising of 
these claims and they have always dissolved in the light of close examination - 
alas.</p>

<p>Board to back interim nuclear-fuel storage in 'centralized' spot</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The U.S. should find a long-term replacement for Yucca Mountain as a place 
to store spent nuclear fuel, but in the meantime should find a short-term 
(decades or more) &quot;centralized&quot; location to store the fuel that's 
piling up at nuclear plants around the country. That is likely to be the 
recommendation of a blue ribbon commission studying nuclear waste disposal, 
according tothis report from Platts, a power-industry publication.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>About 65,000 metric tons of spent fuel is sitting at nuclear plants around 
the country; most in dry casks but some in the sort of pools that have caused 
problems at the Fukushima Daiichi reactors in Japan. Vermont Yankee uses pools, 
and has more fuel stored than at those damaged reactors. Seabrook Station uses 
dry storage. (Detailed report of that storage here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Platts makes the recommendation sound pretty content-free - specifically, 
it doesn't recommend actual site(s) for the interim storage.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Who tested the DNA to confirm the Dakota-to-Connecticut mountain lion?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The surprising news that the mountain lion killed by a car in Connecticut 
had walked over the course of a couple of years from South Dakota led me to 
wonder who exactly figured this out. (Older post on the subject here) Turns out 
it was theForest Service Wildlife Genetics Laboratory in Missoula, Montana, 
which does DNA tests on collected samples of hair, scat and carcasses of 
mountain lions throughout the country..They do this sort of analysis all the 
time, it seems: A look through their &quot;news&quot; section finds reports of 
them confirming the origin of lots of road-killed mountain lions - except that 
all of them are west of Chicago. Until now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They do some other cool stuff, too, including a project called 
&quot;Determining Fisher distribution in the Rocky Mountains.&quot; For some 
reason, I'd always thought that fishers (a large cousin of the weasel) were 
Eastern animals.</p>

<p>Some more trees infested with Asian longhorn beetles have been found in 
Worcester, Mass., as the Telegraph-Gazette reportsin this story. The 
infestation has now led to a staggering 30,000 trees being destroyed; the story 
calls it the biggest ALB site in North America.</p> 
<p>The really interesting tidbit was this: &quot;trained beetle-sniffing dogs 
will be brought from Georgia to Worcester County in mid-August to try to locate 
the elusive beetles.&quot; A little online hunting finds lots of reports about 
dogs being used to sniff out bedbugs - The Atlantic magazinehad this story - 
but nothing about them sniffing Asian longhorn beetles.</p> 
<p>There are dogs which have been trained to sniff out invasive weeds, however,

<p>Vermont utility coop goes for &quot;big wind&quot;, big time</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Large-scale wind projects have always had a mixed environmental image: Good 
alternative to burning fossil fuels for electricity, bad disruption of 
relatively pristine ridgelines or mountaintops. In Vermont, that debate has 
shifted in favor of big wind, which got a big boost after with the Vermont 
Electric Cooperative voting more than 4-1 to build new transmission lines that 
are necessary for a proposed 21-turbine, 63-megawatt wind project along some 
three miles of Lowell Mountain ridgline, in the remote Northeast Kingdom*.Check 
out the Free-Press editorial here.</p> 
<p>If a cooperative (a form of governance that brings out the cranky 
nay-saying liberal in many people) in Vermont (a state where 
&quot;environmentalist&quot; is most people's middle name, often preceded by 
&quot;extreme&quot;) favors a big wind project in its own neighborhood, then 
perhaps the environmental concerns aren't as widely held as it sometimes seems.

<p>Is the Atlantic cod making a comeback? Canada thinks maybe so</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Canadian researchers say that fundamental changes to the marine ecosystem 
off Nova Scotia have supported a rebound in stocks of cod and other groundfish 
that might be signs of a turnaround, years after fishing moratoriums were 
declared because of collapse in populations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the story in the Globe and Mail: &quot;The Nature study traced the 
increase in cod stocks to the decline of forage fish, which prey on cod during 
their early life stages. The forage fish, which include species such as 
herring, exploded after cod stocks plummeted. However, the forage fish appear 
to have overrun their food supply. &hellip; According to the latest count, the 
cod population in the waters off Nova Scotia was at 34 per cent of pre-collapse 
levels.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If this is a true turnaround, it's important because it shows that crashes 
of major ocean species can be reversed if we leave them alone. It raises hope 
for species like the Atlantic herring, whose catch limit is currently the topic 
of much debate in New Hampshire,as this story notes. Of course, it's easy for 
landlubbers like me to be objective; it's not an easy topic if you depend on 
fishing for your livelihood.</p>

<p>A visit to the overseers of the region's power grid</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Globe has a story today about the power-use prediction work at ISO-New 
England, which controls the region's power grid.Their main job on hot summer 
days, when power usage hits its peak (the switch away from electric heat and 
the addition of air conditioning means that New England no longer uses the most 
power in winter), is to decide how much energy will be needed that day and 
whether they'll need to buy any on the open market, or call in any demand 
response (contracted arrangements under which companies ramp back their usage 
when needed, in return for lower rates). From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>First, they consider the weather, using three different services: Will it 
be hot? Humid? Cloudy or cloudless? Then, they consider history: How did energy 
consumers react the last time temperatures rose above 90 degrees? Next, they

<p>When prizes are 'rolled down', lotteries can become profitably unfair</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When it comes to playing lotteries, the key metric is expected payout - 
basically, the sum of potential winnings divided by the odds of a given ticket 
winning. If it's above 1, it's worth a shot. Those much-publicized 
hundred-million-dollar SuperBigBuxPayoutLottoguy games aren't any good if 300 
million tickets are bought by other &quot;you can't win if you can't play&quot; 
suckers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lotteries never have better-than-1 payouts, because then they'd lose money 
- except in unusual circumstances, usually involving a contest of limited 
duration and set number of tickets, in which prizes are &quot;rolled over&quot; 
if they're not won early. A Milford math teacher realized this back in 2009 and 
bought hundreds of dollars worth of a scratch game called New Hampshire 
Millionaire's Club because the payoff had bloomed while the number of remaining 
tickets shrunk due to a shortage of winners. This raised the expected payout, 
and he won a million bucks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Apparently a similar thing is happening, on a more subtle scale involving 
the low-end prizes, with a Massachusetts game called Cash WinFall. It works 
because unwon big prizes are sprinkled down to lower levels, raising the 
expected payout for the smaller prizes.&nbsp;The Globe has a detailed story here
.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The payout is subtle enough that it requires buying hundreds of thousands 
of dollars worth of tickets. It requires putting together groups who descend on 
lots of stores, because you can't crank out that many tickes at once.</p>

<p>Here's the NSW post. I guess this phenomenon is not that uncommon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Industrial composting is a lot more complicated than my backyard piles of 
stuff</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My compost piles (one yard waste, one food waste - so I can play in the 
leaves and not worry about coffee grounds or banana peels!) are of the 
&quot;cold composting&quot; types, which means I throw everything in a pile and 
leave it for a couple of years. I don't even turn them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I can do this because I have space and time. I don't care too much about 
the product; the main reason I compost food is to make the trash less smelly on 
the weekly trip to the dump.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Commercial composting, which needs to kill off pathogens and create 
sellable product in reasonably short periods of time, have to be more 
systematic and intelligent about it. I didn't realize how systemetic they had 
gotten until I read a Free-Press article about a new high-tech composting 
facility in Vermont - it's indoors, not outdoor, and the main problem so far is 
keeping thepiles from getting *too* hot, which kills beneficial bacteria.</p>

<p>Ig Nobel tickets go on sale today! Be there, or be non-Ig-ish</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tickets for the Twenty-First 1st Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony go on sale 
today at noon. Unlike previous years, all the tickets will go on sale at once, 
so get your early.If you've never attended an Ig ceremony, you have missed out 
on a unique cultural institution. If Harpo Marx, Laurel and Hardy, and the 
Three Stooges on a non-violent day got together and planned a science fair, and 
invited a handful of real Nobel laureates to play along, it would look sort of 
like this.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Harvard Box Office handles all ticket sales: 
https://www.boxoffice.harvard.edu</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(They are non-cheap: $65, $45. $35, depending on where you are in the 
auditorium; students $40, $30. But you get what you pay for.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ceremony will happen at the usual place (opulent Sanders Theater at 
Harvard). This year's theme: Chemistry. It's on Thursday, Sept. 29, at 7:30 
p.m. (Marc Abrahams, Head Ig, sent out a note saying &quot;we are aware this 
coincides with the Rosh Hashanah holiday. Various calendar constraints collided 
this year.&quot;)</p>

<p>When water chestnuts invade a river, they *really* invade it</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column this week (read it here) includes a video by staff 
photographer Don Himsel of canoing past a large mat of water chestnuts on the 
Nashua River. It's worth checking</p> 
<p>out.</p> 
<p>These water chestnuts (not the edible kind, alas) are one of several 
aquatic invasive species bedeviling New Hampshire. They're not quite as 
god-awful as milfoil, but they blanket the surface with mats so thick you can't 
row through them, doing a number on other waterlife. It's even dangerous to 
fall out of the boat in a mat; each floating flower has long, strong fibers 
that connect them to the river bottom, and these can really tangle swimmers.</p>

<p>Strontium-90 found in 'edible portions' of fish near Vermont Yankee</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vermont's governor, who wants to shut down Vermont Yankee, said Tuesday 
that some strontium-90 has been found in &quot;edible portions&quot; of fish in 
the Connecticut River near the nuclear power plant.More details are to be 
released Wednesday.Free-Press story here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>WEDNESDAY MORNING UPDATE: There was one finding &quot;just above the lower 
limit of detection in one fish sample&quot; and it's the first time the 
radioactive material has been found in an edible portion of any of the fish 
routinely sampled near the plant, said the Vt. Health Department. But the level 
is low enough that the state issued no warnings against eating fish from the 
Connecticut River.&nbsp;Longer Free-Press story here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: New Hampshire Health and Human Services hasn't 
heard any mroe details about the report, which concerns a fish caught in 2010. 
NH says it hasn't detected the radiation near the plant in recent months.</p>

<p>Yesterday was August 2, 2011, which means it was Wi-Fi Day: 8.02.11</p>

<p>Automated fraud detection worked for our credit card</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We got a machine-voice call last night from Discover Card, checking on 
recent purchases made on my wife's credit card. It listed through a couple and 
sure enough: $900+ had been spent at walmart.com yesterday using the card, but 
not by us. My wife talked to a human; they yanked the purchase and issued her a 
new card.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't know what algorithm they used to flag that purchase - the card is 
used largely for buying groceries and gas, so it stood out - but well done to 
its programmers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We have no idea how the card's number got swiped; the card itself hasn't 
been lost. Maybe it was part of one of those thefts of customer info which have 
been so endemic lately.</p>

<p>NorthernPass hydropower line delayed at least a year</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The much-debated Northern Pass power line, designed to bring 1,200 
megawatts of hydropower down from Quebec to New England, has pushed back its 
earliest turn-on date from 2015 to 2016. The dealy is related to difficulty in 
finding a route for the northernmost 40 miles which, unlike most of the rest of 
the 140-mile project, would require a new right-of-way to be cut through 
forestland.</p>

<p>Farmers markets create thousands of jobs, says UCS</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I love the &quot;localvore&quot; movement - the push for people to grow, 
buy and eat more food that's grown in their area - even though I realize its 
limitations. Local food will never create a huge chunk of modern society's 
calorie input, at least not in the crowded, only-so-so-for-agriculture 
Northeast. But it can make a difference, it provides a dose of healthy food, it 
re-connects us with the environment and provides a financial incentive to 
create something other than plain woodlands or endless buildings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And here's another benefit: It makes a lot of work for people. (You can't 
outsource killing squash bugs or stipping old, dead canes from the raspberry 
patch.)&Acirc;&nbsp; The Union of Concerned Scientists says in a new report 
that farmers markets have grown 20 times over four decades and has the 
potential to be a major job creator, although out financial and regulatory 
policies have been created to help big agriculture, which holds things back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the report, which is more regulatory than scientific.</p>

<p>A good example of why rankings done by algorithm are suspect</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boston-area media guy Dan Kenney has a great item today in reactino to 
Forbes trashing Northeastern University in Boston in its annual ranking of 
colleges. Forbes doesn't visit all umpty-hundred schools in the country; it 
just compiles various measurements and churns them through a simple algorithm 
so it can put out a list and get attention.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Why did Northeastern do badly? Because it stunk on the &quot;four-year 
graduation rate&quot; - zero percent! Egad!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The problem, as locqals know, is that Northeastern's unusual coop-learning 
program means that it's a five-year school. You're not<em>allowed </em>to 
graduate in four years.</p>

<p>Obsolete Technology: Dolphin head oil for clocks</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Back when I was taking a correspondence course in camera repair, part of 
the tools provided was a small bottle of camera and clock special oil. It's 
still in the original box along with a sheet describing the contents and other 
products. Here are the most interesting paragraphs of the sheet:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>EZRA KELLEY AND WILLIAM NYE </p> 
<p>Early in the nineteenth century, while experimenting with various fatty 
oils for use in clocks and chronometers, Ezra Kelley (1798-1895) a New Bedford 
clockmaker, came by chance upon a byproduct of some now forgotten whaling 
voyage, the head oil from a dolphin caught for food or sport. A triglyceride 
like all fats, this oil was unique in its low temperature properties and in its 
stability against oxidation or gumming. Kelley's experiments with this oil 
produced a startling improvement in clock lubrication; and by the latter half 
of the 1800's, the use of dolphin head or porpoise jaw oil for timepiece 
lubrication had virturally become standard, not only in the United States but 
through Europe as well.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>SOURCES OF THE DOLPHIN OILS </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Most of the smaller toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises, have 
small quantities of oil in cavities in the head, especially in the brain 
&quot;melon&quot; and in the glands of the jaw hinges. . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At one time Nye depended for a supply on strandings along the coasts of 
Massachusetts Bay, Buzzards Bay and on Cape Cod. During the early decades of 
this century the company operated an unusual &quot;porpoise fishery&quot; on 
the Hatteras Banks of North Carolina. There the animals were caught in huge 
seines which were dragged through the surf to shore. Today, William F. Nye, 
Inc., obtains blackfish head oil produced as a byproduct of larger commercial 
whale-harvesting enterprises in Canada and the West Indies. The oil is 
intensively refined and purified at the company plant in Fairhaven, MA.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This was printed in the 1960's. The company also handles synthetic 
oils,which have replaced traditional sources.</p>

<p>Testing an underwater &quot;windmill&quot; (yes, another one)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Getting hydropower from the tides or underwater river flows (as compared to 
putting up a dam) seems obvious and straightforward to us laymen. The water is 
moving naturally and carries much more energy that moving air, so let's use it 
to spin some turbine blades - voila! electricity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, as the paucity of such systems shows, it's hard to build machinery 
that will stand up to the pounding of moving water, particularly seawater, is 
tough. Doing it in a way that doesn't interfere with ecosystems that depend on 
the moving water is even tougher.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a result, while I've posted to lots of stories over the years about 
tests of tidal power or run-of-the-river underwater turbines, nobody's done 
much with such &quot;hydrokinetic&quot; power. But they're still trying: Free 
Flow Power of Boston is testing 6,000-pound, 10-foot-tall turbines,which look 
like jet engines, on the floor of the Mississippi River in a whole bunch of 
locations:Globe story here.</p>

<p>Finding a shark in the woods, 50 miles from the ocean</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was going to link important but dull stories about underwater turbines or 
concrete science, but this one is more fun: In Milton, New Hampshire, near the 
Maine border about 50 miles from the ocean, people found a dead, six-footblue 
shark discarded in the woods. Here's the story from the Union-Leader.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The assumption is that a fisherman dumped it on the way home because he/she 
didn't have an ocean-fishing license. The best part of the story is the fact 
that they left the corpse there: &quot;We're just letting nature take its 
course.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nanocomp's carbon nanotube material used in NASA's Jupiter mission</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Concord N.H.-based Nanocomp weaves together carbon nanotubes into yarn and 
fabric that conducts electricity and has interesting thermal properties but 
which, most importantly, is very light. Their target customer is the aerospace 
industry, where a gram saved is a dollar (or maybe $1,000) saved.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can't more aerospace-y than Juno, NASA's just-launched mission to 
Juptier. So it's understandable that Nanocomp is proud that contractor 
Lockheed-Martin used Nanocomp's material, calle EMShield, in the fabrication of 
the craft a good way to block electrostatic discharge that can happen from as 
spacecraft pass through charges particles in space. From the press release: 
&quot;Lockheed was interested in implementing an alternative ESD solution to 
traditional aluminum foil that is typically bonded to the surface of 
composites. By adding EMSHIELD CNT sheet layers during fabrication of the 
composite, they were able to integrate ESD protection directly onto the 
structure, making the composite a multifunctional element of the 
spacecraft.&quot; (Read the whole release here )</p>

<p>Visiting Nashua's unique triangular manhole covers</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nashua is slowly replacing its unique triangular manholes with round ones, 
because the triangles aren't big enough to meet modern safety standards. (The 
big problem: You can't get down them wearing breathing apparatus, if there's a 
gas problem below.) Nobody makes new ones, so the city is switching to the 
national standard. They still have a few hundred triangles to replace, though, 
so they won't disappear immediately.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I love those triangular covers, because they're unique so far as I can 
tell*, and just plain cool. For example, they point in the direction that the 
water is supposed to flow beneath them, providing a bit of information to sewer 
workers. They also rattle less when cars pass over them, compared to round ones.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm going to visit one of the replacement jobs this morning. Sometimes my 
job is excellent.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>*A development in San Francisco has triangular covers to its water valves, 
as shownin this photo, but that's not quite the same thing. They are extra 
cool, however, in that the cover is aReuleaux triangle, a curve of constant 
width - meaning the cover can't fall down through its own hole.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you love manhole covers, by the way, Drainspotting is the site for you.

<p>Cape Cod's &quot;arm&quot; is slowly rotating, and climate change is 
speeding it up</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Cape Code Times has a fine article about what erosion is doing to Cape 
Code's shape, and how the increase in strong storms and rise in sea level 
associated with a warming planet is accelerating that erosion.&nbsp;You can 
read the whole story, with an excellent illustration, here. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the past 15,000 years, Georges Bank has served as a protective barrier 
for Cape Cod, blocking large ocean waves coming from the southeast. Now, the 
water over Georges Bank is deep enough to allow those waves to make landfall. 
That's accelerating erosion at southerly beaches, pushing more sand northward 
and slowing erosion at beaches up the coast. &quot;Basically it means that Cape 
Cod is rotating clockwise about half a degree per millennium,&quot; said Adams.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Eventually, the &quot;fist&quot; that holds Provincetown is going to become 
an island.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Triangular manhole covers vs. circular manhole covers - size matters</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The above photo by Don Himsel, taken during our visit to a DPW work site 
yesterday, show why Nashua is getting rid of its unique-in-the-world (so far as 
I can tell) triangular manhole covers: They're too small for today's workers 
wearing various safety equipment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The triangles are 25.5 inches at the widest point (top to midpoint of 
opposite side), the circles are 31.5 inches in diameter. So the circle is 
roughly twice the area of the triangle; there's a bit of lip overlap that 
complicates the calculation, hence my fudging.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I wouldn't want to squeeze through that triangle-sized hole carrying a gas 
monitor (sewer gas buildup can be quick and deadly) or a harness, which allows 
me to be pulled out if necessary.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Like bird-watchers, except they watch butterlies</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column this week is about the (to me) obscure pasttime of 
butterfly-watching, which is exactly like bird-watching (life lists, field 
guides, trips to special places to see special species at special times) except 
you don't have to get up as early, because butterflies only come out when it's 
sunny.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Read about it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After the column came out, I was reminded by readers about the New 
Hampshire Dragonfly Survey, which has volunteers charging through bogs and 
fields, looking for the one flying insect that is even cooler than butterflies. 
It started in 2007 and wraps up this year.</p>

 The new Department of Innovation logo, with some pulled-apart gears
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Those gears on the Innovation Blog logo aren't interlocked any more!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Smithsonian.com has fixed the logo of its new blog called Department of 
Innovation, which&nbsp; I (and many others) ridiculed. The graphics designer 
pulling two of the gears apart so the triad is no longer an immovable, 
interlocking mess. The blog page includes this rather gritted-teeth editor's 
note: Thank you to everyone for your comments about our logo. We have since 
shifted the gears and switched in a new logo. (I bet that &quot;thank you&quot; 
isn't exactly what the editor was thinking.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One Smithsonian commenter notes, by the way, that the spacing of teeth on 
the lower gear makes it appear that it won't mesh properly with the big gear, 
so maybe the logo isn't out of the woods yet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The best comment on the Smithsonian site is the person who pointed out 
(tongue in cheek, I hope), that we all leapt to the assumption that the gears 
are in the same plane! &quot;Think outside the box&quot; he/she cried.</p>

<p>Google has updated its street view of Nashua at least three times since it

<p>They're updating it again, judging from the Google Street View car, spotted 
by Nashua resident Chris Malloy on Wednesday on Broad Street.</p>

<p>Terrorists send bombs to nano-technology professors in Mexico</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Concern about &quot;gray goo&quot; or something like it has led some 
terrorists to send mail bombs to a couple of Mexican professors working in 
nano-tech. Miami Herald story here. From the story: &quot;The ITS is a movement 
that, in accordance with its ideals, opposes any development of neo- or 
nanotechnology anywhere in the world, and they are linked to attacks in several 
different countries of Europe, including Spain and France.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The bomb was desdcribed as &quot;rudimentary&quot; - one advantage of being 
targeted by Luddites, I guess - although one professor was slightly injured.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>I don't suppose UNH's Center for High-Rate Nanomanufacturing has much to 
worry about. Deleted funding is probably more of an issue.</p>

<p>Boston's weekly carbon-emissions pattern: Weekends are quiet</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This picture does not show a huge robotic hand controlled by aliens seeking 
to steal Earth women, although that's what it looks like: It shows part of the 
apparatus used at Boston University to make detailed measurements of carbon 
dioxide in the city. In geek-speak, it's part of &quot;an NSF funded research 
project investigating the space-time variation in Metropolitan Boston's carbon 
metabolism.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The project is called Ultra-Ex, and is one of a bunch of such research 
programs getting data to make decisions about how to make modern cities more 
sustainable in terms of energy use, water use, pollution and such issue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I learned of it from this Green blog item on the NY Times site, which 
talked about the site's discovery of a &quot;weekend effect,&quot; a clear 
drop-off in the amount of carbon dioxide entering the city's atmosphere on 
Saturdays and Sundays.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the meantime, though, I'm waiting for the Giant Claw From Aldebaran to 
seize the top four stories of the Pru Tower.</p>

<p>Wind power is a problem on hot, still days, so pay people to use less</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From a NY Times story about power companies struggling with peak demand 
this summer:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Peak supply is also becoming a vexing problem because so much of the 
generating capacity added around the country lately is wind power, which is 
almost useless on the hot, still days when air-conditioning drives up demand.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PJM, which once stood for Pennsylvania, Jersey and Maryland, factors in 
such variability, counting a 100-megawatt wind farm as being worth only 13 
megawatts on a peak summer day, for example. While over the course of a year 
the wind machines can contribute mightily to kilowatt hours produced, they do 
much of their production on windy winter nights, according to experts at PJM 
and other grid organizations.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In summer, utility planners have increasingly turned to a tool known as 
demand response, in which big customers sign up to have some of their power 
switched off in exchange for cash payments or cheaper rates. It is somewhat 
like an airline passenger's volunteering to be &quot;bumped&quot; in exchange 
for a free ticket. Companies recruit consumers willing to have their 
consumption electronically throttled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New England was a leader in demand response, and currently has enough 
signed up to theoretically exceed the output of Seabrook Station nuclear plant.

<p>New England's first Level 4 biohazard lab still on hold</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boston University has a building that it wants to use as a Biosafety Level 
4 laboratory, to study pathogens that cause fatal disease in humans for which 
treatment is not available&nbsp; There are six such labs in the continent, none 
closer than Maryland. The building was completed in 2008 but hasn't been used 
because of neighborhood opposition. Folks get a little nervous when ebola moves 
in next door.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Globe reports that BU is going to open part of the buildilng as a Level 
2 laboratory, which handles less dangerous pathogens. Their first research will 
be on the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. They still hope to open the Level 4 
portion: seethe BU FAQ here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Level 4 labs have all sorts of safety precautions when entering or leving 
through muliple airlocks, including ultraviolet light rooms. They also 
decontaminate air and water service.</p>

<p>Handling Hyphens</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My wife just had a routine procedure at St Joseph's in Nashua. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The checking procedure went smoothly until they asked for her full name. 
She uses her maiden name and my last name seperated by a hyphen. No, she can't 
do that. The computer system can't deal with a hyphenated name.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's pretty strange to me. After all, more women and some children have 
this as part of their legal name. Questioning the receptionist didn't reveal 
any reason beyond &quot;We can't do that&quot;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My sister-in-law works in a hospital in Maine so I asked her the question. 
She made a couple of calls to St Joseph's. She was told that is was a 
compatibility problem between two computer systems, the checkin system and the 
billing system. I would think that in this day and age that such an obvious 
issue could be easily solved.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, I'm not the one who has to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Using a Vermont wasp to see if tree-destroying ash borers have arrived</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Cerceris wasp, a wide-ranging predator, carries the bugs that it 
catches back to its nest, which is a hole in the ground. If you spook it at the 
right time, it will drop the prety outside the nest.Emerald ash borers, the 
invasive insect that is destroying ash trees by the millions as it slowly makes 
it way here, is among the things it likes to eat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These three traits combined mean that Cerceris wasps can act as a sort of 
scout, that will help us see if the borers have arrived here. Spook lots of 
wasps near a nesting site, then see what prey was abandoned nearby - clever. 
The Burlington Free-Press has a story, with some good photos,here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You've probably seen emerald ash borer traps hanging in trees, also 
designed to spot early arrivals. They're weird triangular things, 
purple-colored and baited with phermone to attracted the bugs. FromUniveristy 
of Maryland: &quot;It's made out of thin, corrugated, purple plastic that has 
been coated with non-toxic glue on all three sides. The purple prisms are about 
24 inches long and hang vertically in an ash tree or are secured to the trunk 
of a tree. To increase the attractiveness of the trap to the beetles, it is 
baited with a lure (Manuka oil). Scientists found that buprestids (the insect 
family to which EAB belongs) in general are more attracted to red and purple 
hues compared to other colors. Researchers initiated a study using a variety of 
red and purple traps to determine which trap attracted the most beetles; the 
purple trap achieved the best results.&quot;</p>

<p>Chain Letters</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I was a kid, chain letters were very common. They usually came with 
promises of bad luck, examples enclosed of people who broke the chain suffering 
loss or even death. If you responded, sending stamps or a dollar bill to the 
person at the top of the list, you were guaranteed thousands of dollars return 
on your small investment. All you had to do was to make five to ten copies of 
the letter and then send them out to friends who would pass on more copies to 
ten more unique people. How could it possibly fail?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Obviously, the math doesn't work. There aren't an infinite number of 
suckers in the world willing to throw their money in the ring. The post office 
has long ago determined that these schemes are illegal.&Acirc;&nbsp; There is 
usually some disclaimer in the letter that the contents were not illegal, that 
there was room for interpretation and anyway, how could something that made so 
much easy money for good people be wrong?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Growing up, we had neighbors up the street who were very superstitious. 
Putting up a calendar too early, a broken mirror, ignoring a chain letter were 
all grounds for serious bad luck. When one of these came in, copies were made 
and sent out. Did any of these ever pay off? Of course not. Even though the 
cards were parsed out and read every day and chain letters sent out their luck 
never seemed to change.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now on to Facebook. I've noticed quite a few 'chain letters' on Facebook 
lately. They usually have some political or comic or tragic theme along with a 
request to send the link along to your friends. The internet has been clogged 
with these for years, usually sent by people with a new computer and email 
account. They've found the joy of on line funny stories, photos and videos. 
They simply have to pass on the joy to everyone on their email 
list.&Acirc;&nbsp; I've more than once responded harshly to distant friends, 
especially when on the road with a slow connection. The facebook distribution 
is a little more disturbing. These are from people that I've specifically 
chosen to be friends. I have a small list, those relatives or people that I 
feel a connection to.&Acirc;&nbsp; There have been some mistakes but I don't 
feel strongly enough to&Acirc;&nbsp; defriend just yet. Still, when I see the 
list of messages that read &quot;You simply must read this and pass it 
on&quot;, my inclination to be polite gets strained.</p>

<p>Magnetic Paint</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Mont Vernon Library wanted to mount a metal panel on a corner post so 
that they could display notices easily. We had just seen a DIY TV program on 
using magnetic paint to make a quick and easy board for a kids room.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My wife decided to give it a try, purchasing a quart at Milford Paint. It 
worked very well. We used 1/2&acirc;&#128;&sup3; plywood as the base since we 
wanted some structural strength. I could be painted on an existing wall 
instead. It took the recommended three coats to build up enough base thickness. 
Our librarian uses regular magnets to hold the postings and works much better 
than pushpins.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't have the can since we used it all, so don't have the manufacturer 
but it should be easy to find if someone wants to try this.</p>

<p>Lobstering</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My grandfather and I had a great arrangement. I would row and he would tell 
stories about his life and the way things were when he was growing up. I heard 
about my great-grandfather who lived during the civil war. I heard stories 
about fishing and whaling and the steamboats that traversed the Maine coast. 
Some of these exciting stories were even true. I heard some of the same tales 
from the old men in town while getting a haircut in Red's Barbershop in town. 
It really connected me to history.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Later, when I went out with my father in a much better boat, it wasn't the 
same. Dad wasn't a talker. We would do the whole trip out and back with just a 
few necessary words exchanged. Still, those early mornings on Penobscot Bay, 
especially when there was no wind, the bay like a mirror made for some of my 
best memories. I wish I had then the same photo equipment I have now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We used a state issued brass gauge to measure from the eye socket to the 
end of the carapace. Too large or too small meant we had to throw it back. If 
we found a &quot;seed&quot; lobster, one with eggs tucked under that tail, we 
threw that one back after cutting a notch in the tail fin. All this was done to 
ensure the healthy population. Historically, these conservation measures have 
been very successful. Studies have suggested that the bait we used has fed 
lobsters during their growth period to adulthood. I know that we went through a 
few barrels of sardine heads and tails to stuff our bait bags. That was one of 
my jobs, reaching down into the barrel of bait stored over the winter, filling 
the net bag and cinching up the drawstring. We would tie this on a peg inside 
the trap, attracting crabs, sea urchins, snails and the occasional lobster. It 
was smelly work, but I never gave it a thought. It was just the way it was.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We were small time operators, doing it mostly as an expensive hobby and 
loving the lifestyle. The big time lobstermen, those with hundreds of traps 
resented us. Sometimes we would find our traps surrounded by their traps. It's 
a wonder that any lobster escaped but there always seemed to be more. The Maine 
coast had a great die off of eel grass and the loss of habitat caused a drop in 
fish and lobsters for a while, but they came back, just the same as before.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm sure the economics seldom came out positive. Still, at 35 cents a 
pound, it paid for the gas, maintained the boat with just a little left over. 
It's a tough life and I'm not sorry to be out of it. Once I escaped Maine and 
saw the world, I could never go back.</p>

<p>Boston has two - two! - professional chess teams. Seriously.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column last week was about the U.S. Chess League, the 
little-known professional chess league, which has two franchises in the Boston 
area: the Boston Blitz and the New England Nor'easters. The league plays 
four-on-four tournaments over theInternet Chess Club, and you can pay to watch. 
It has top-level grandmaster talent, including Larry Christiansen of the Boston 
Blitz and the country's top-rated player, Hikaru Nakamura, but most of the 
players get a few hundred dollar stipend, at most.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The most interesting thing to the outsider is that the teams can have 
average ratings of no more than 2400 (senior master level, well below 
grandmaster) and so you can't just load up on superstars; you've got to balance 
the roster. That's why the Nor'easters won the championship in their first year 
- they had a good mix of skill levels.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>High-level chess is an insular world and the league is pretty 
publicity-shy, or more accurately just doesn't t care about publicity. - I had 
great trouble finding anybody to contact so I could do the story. Eventhe 
league's Web site is rinky-dink.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This wasn't really a surprise. I played a little in high school and 
college, when Bobby Fischer's shadow still covered everything. My USCF rating 
never got above about 1200, which isn't even advanced beginner, but even I 
could see then that chess didn't care two hoots about the rest of the universe.

downtown Concord. It's free, although you have to buy your own food and drink.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geeks of a certain stripe may be more interested in the October 19 cafe, 
which will concern digital privacy - whether it's possible, how it can be done, 
whether it's even desirable. SCNH co-founder Dan Marcek just lined up the first

<p>When lightning just misses you and hits a tree, it isn't necessarily white
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I recently got this email from a friend of mine, Pete King:</p> 
<p>I hiked the Kinsman Ridge (south of Cannon Mt) yesterday with a couple of 
friends.&nbsp; We were rushing down to beat the lightning storm and were less 
than &frac14; mile from the Lonesome Lake hut in thick trees when lightning hit 
a tree or the ground about 30 - 50 feet from us.&nbsp; It was an amazing bright 
orange/red color, and it was like the woosh of a propane grill lighting after 
you left the gas on too long. There was of course the loud crack of the 
thunder, but I didn't hear the snap of electric discharge or smell ozone (but 
also didn't stick around for more than a second). &nbsp;&nbsp;It took a few 
seconds for our eyes to adjust from the flash but the two of us closest though 
the orange cylinder was around 10 feet in diameter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(In a follow-up, Pete emailed: My reaction to the lightning earned me the 
trail name &quot;Flame Runner&quot;)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wow. As this FAQ from wvlightning.com says, &quot;When lightning strikes an 
object or the ground, the lightning channel is often a deep red or orange color 
for its last ten feet or so above the ground or the target object. Lightning 
striking a tree will appear a bright, fiery orange/red color for the length of 
the channel traveling down the tree.&quot;</p>

<p>Small wind power for homes is a dud in N.H.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The state's rebate program for small-scale (under 5 kilowatt) alternate 
energy demonstrates one fact for New Hampshire homes seeking to generate their 
own electricity: Wind power is hardly a factor. In its three years, only 37 
applications for wind power have been paid out to homeowners, less than 
one-tenth the number of solar applications. Almost no new applications are 
coming in.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Jonathan Osgood, energy conversation coordinator for the state Public 
Utilities Commission, said the decline is a reflection of the fact that 
small-scale wind power often doesn't work as well as people think it will.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We've had comments from other state and from people who got early 
rebates, that they were discouraged. We're heard them say that neighbors with 
photovoltaic systems had more production in a day than they had in a 
month,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The problem is twofold: Homeowners often overestimate how much wind blows 
in a given location, and wind power improves as the length of the blades of the 
turbine increase &acirc;&#128;&#147; that is, power is proportional to the 
swept area of rotating blades, in technical terms. This is why utilities 
continue to invest in very large wind turbines on windy mountain ridges even as 
homeowner systems languish.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Many designs have been floated over the years for turbines that will 
allegedly get more power out of the sort of light and variable winds 
encountered at many homes, but so far they have not reached great commercial 
success.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The above item was the &quot;sidebar&quot; to my story in Monday's 
Telegraph about the slow growth of at-home solar energy spurred by the state 
rebate program, which (surprise, surprise) is having some financial issues. I'm 
reprinting the sidebar here because it's easy to overlook them online, and I 
thought it was interesting. Read the whole story here.</p>

<p>Carrion beetle - wikipedia photo</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nature's gross-out beauty: Carrion beetles consume a dead bird in a day</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I came back from vacation to find a dead black bird (maybe a blackbird, 
maybe a small crow, maybe something else) in my yard. It was very dead - no 
eyes, etc. - but was pulsating as if it was still alive, because dozens of 
large, black-and-yellow beetles were eating it. The scene was gross but 
fascinating; nature at its most unnervingly efficient.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The beetles are, not surprisingly, carrion beetles. (I didn't have a 
camera, so I've attached a wikipedia photo.) They crawled all over the bird in 
a frenzy, diving in and out of the body. The next morning, there's nothing but 
a stinky pile of bones and feathers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The surprising thing is that I have never seen the beetles before, even 
though they are big - about the size of a nickle - and handsome. Obviously a 
lot are around all the time, or they couldn't have swarmed like they did.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a lot of life around that we don't know about.</p>

<p>Quintet of birch trees fallen at once</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A birch-tree star: Five full-grown trees knocked down at once</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This picture shows the scene at a campsite in the Adirondacks where my 
family stayed last week. Five full-grown birch trees, some a good foot across, 
had sprouted from one spot, and something knocked them all down at once, 
creating an almost perfect star. It had only happened a few days earlier, since 
the leaves were still green. No sign of lightning, so I assume it was just wind 
hitting the weakest of the five, and all the rest fell as a result</p>

<p>Maine lobsters are booming - are they booming too much?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The lobster population off the coast of Maine (and New Hampshire, of 
course, although we don't have much of a coast) are doing very well - so well, 
in fact, that lobstering now makes up an incredible 80 percent of Maine's 
seafood income, according tothis NY Time story.&nbsp; however, this success 
creates financial&nbsp; vulnerability for the state when the lobster population 
crashes or declines. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Only a few decades ago, Dr. Steneck said, the Maine fishery included cod, 
hake, haddock, halibut and swordfish, many of them lobster predators. Intense 
fishing has just about eliminated most of them. Meanwhile, baited traps provide 
lobsters with a steady food supply. That has created an artificial ecosystem in 
which lobsters are &quot;hyperdense.&quot; This kind of single-species crowding 
can be disastrous in the event of outbreaks like the parasite infestations and 
shell disease that severely reduced lobster yields in southern New England 
waters.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A report urges work to increase environmental diversity in the Gulf of 
Maine, even though it might diminish lobster numbers somewhat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maine lobstering is often held up as a model for ocean fisheries management 
- the population of crustaceans has staid healthy while the population of 
boat-manning humans staying financially healthy. This is partly because 
lobstering is easier to control, since you can carve up territory and assign it 
to different boats, unlike fishing in the open ocean where it's catch as catch 
can. In a way, lobstering is cattle ranching while fishing for, say, tuna, is 
deer hunting.</p>

<p>NH: No tritium found in Connecticut River</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services says water samples 
found no tritium in the Connecticut River near the Vermont Yankee nuclear power 
plant.The tests were made in response to an announcement last week from Vermont 
about tritium having been found in edible portions of a fish, some time ago. 
<em>(Oops - I'm mixing up my radioactive elements. The fish had strontium-90
</em>) </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The state has sampled 9 sites since a tritium leak was first found at 
Vermont Yankee last year. Vermont also sampled from &quot;the point where the 
groundwater flows from the shoreline into the Connecticut River,&quot; said the 
department.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As I noted in an April story (read it here) N.H. has long tested for 
radiation in the air, water and plants and crustaceans throughout the southern 
part of the state to make sure nothing is oozing out of Vermont Yankee or

<p>NH birds: 1/3 doing well, 1/3 so-so, 1/3 in trouble</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire Audubon has issued a citizien's version of its report on the 
state of New Hampshire birds, showing that (very roughly) 1/3 of the 186 
species that breed in NH are in good shape, 1/3 are stable or lacking data, and 
1/3 are declining, notably those who depend on shrubland and grassland. Aerial 
insectivores, including the phoebes that nest in my barn every year, are also 
declining, whereas fish-eating birds like osprey and bald eagles are booming.I 
wrote about the report in April, but the new guide is much easier to handle.</p>

<p>Of hurricanes and toilet bowls</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph science column runs every Monday. I assume that on Monday, 
people will only be thinking of the hurricane as it hits here, so I would like 
to have a hurricane-related science column. All the real science about how they 
form and move and all that has been pretty well hashed out in news stories, 
though, which doesn't leave me much.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Except, of course, it's relationship to the vortex in your toilet bowl flush

<p>Miss USA and teaching evolution in school - reality, and parody</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hurricane planning at the paper hasn't given me time to find local material 
today, but I do have time to (a) cringe and (b) laugh at the two videos linked 
below. One compiles answers from Miss USA candidates to the question 
&quot;should evolution be taught in school&quot; and the other is a parody 
version answering &quot;should math be taught in school.&quot; You gotta love

<p>The hurricane must be real: The White Mountain huts are shutting</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Appalachian Mountain Club is shutting down and evacuating its eight 
high huts in the White Mountains this weekend, because the National Forest 
Service will close the White Mountain National Forest and all of its trails and 
campgrounds as over 6 p.m. Saturday, because of fears about Hurricane Irene. 
Forest roads will be gated and all developed sites and backcountry shelters are 
being evacuated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An AMC spokeswoman emailed me that nobody can remember the huts being 
evacuated, at least not for decades - which I think probably means never, 
because before that there wouldn't have been any way to get the word out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've got to wonder about the various Appalachian Trial through-hikers that 
litter the Whites this time of year, huffing and puffing their way toward Mount 
Katahdin before fall hits. You just know a bunch of them are going to tough it 
out. Hopefully they'll just get really wet.</p>

 CoCoRaHS precipitation map for NH on Aug. 28</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Precipitation volunteers make fascinating reading in a hurricane</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm a volunteer precipitation-measurer for the Community Collaborative 
Rain/Hail/Snow Network (CoCoRaHS) run by the National Weather Service. The site 
(http://cocorahs.org) makes interesting reading today: One volunteer on the 
eastern shore of Maryland reported 11.34 inches of rain in a 24-hour period up 
through this morning. Wow!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I got 1.74 inches overnight, from 5 p.m. when it started until 7:30 this 
morning. The heaviest is yet to come.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, NOAA's gauge at the mouth of the Souhegan was predicting 
a crest of 9 feet by this morning - but it's barely 6 feet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No power at home, but Irene was generally a washout here</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I still don't have power at home ()along with about 85,000 PSNH customers 
in the state), but generally Irene didn't do much damage hereabouts. I got 
about 3.5 inches of rain total, which is hardly record-setting, and only a few 
medium-sized branches fell.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(No power is easier in August than during an ice storm, when freezing pipes 
is a worry. My biggest problem is that I'm on a well, so I have no water. 
Hauling buckets of water from the rain barrel to flush the toilet gets old 
fast.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a sign of how the rain didn't hit, the NOAA's automated gauge at the 
mouth of the Souhegan Riverhad been predicting a crest of 9 feet today - but 
the reality (as shown in the screen shot at left) is less than six feet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The storm shifted west and really nailed Vermont, however.</p>

<p>Back to our regularly scheduled disasters: Tree-eating invasive bugs</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hurricane Irene didn't do as much damage as feared hereabouts, so we can go 
back to worrying about other destructive threats - like tree-eating invasive 
beetles. Two cases:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A detailed study in Worcester, Mass., has found that Asian longhorned 
beetle thrives in thicker woodlands than previously thought, making it more 
likely that it can spread through the forests of New England.Globe story here.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A Cornell University expert admits that we're unlikely to stop the emerald 
ash borer before it pretty much destroys all of the continent's ash trees, just 
as blight destroyed the American elm and the chestnut. &quot;We need to start 
considering how we're going to preserve the genetics so we can perhaps bring 
these back in the future &hellip;.&nbsp; pursuing that Plan B: collecting seeds 
to study and plant at a time when the ash may be able to survive the 
invader.&quot;NPR story here.</p>

know: The King family owns rights to that speech, even though &quot;a speech 
broadcast to a large audience on radio and television, and considered 
instrumental in historic political changes and ranked as the most important 
speech in 20th century American history, would seem to be a prime candidate for 
the public domain,&quot; as Slashdot puts it.</p>

<p>River testing this morning might be a little dicey, thanks to the storm</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Every other Tuesday I, along with a couple dozen other volunteers, collect 
water samples to test local rivers for bacteria and oxygen count. I may have to 
bail out, so to speak, this morning: The rivers rose alot Monday due to the 
water from Irene, and according to a nearby hydraulic gauge the flow is almost 
900 cubic feet/second, which is about four times what it was last time and more 
than 20 times the usual flow for this time of year (when it's usually very low).
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The banks a little steep where I usually go &hellip; I might have to try to 
find another spot.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the page where we record results, on the Souhegan, Merrimack and 
Nashua rivers.</p>

<p>Air conditioning &amp; Texas drought = twice New England's electricity usage
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Air conditioning has become the biggest power draw in the U.S., overall; 
even here in New England, the peak usage occurs in summer, not winter (partly 
because we've switched from electric heat to oil).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Down in Texas they are suffering through a drought and heat wave of 
near-biblical proportions, with triple digits for months on end. It also has a 
separate electric grid, as a result of historical accidents. Yesterday, the 
Texas grid used a staggering 65,443 megawatts of electricity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How staggering is that? The total capacity of all electricity generation in 
the six New England states is a bit under 30,000 megawatts (ISO-New England, 
which runs the grid, also has 1,235 MW of imports on call and 1.260 MW of 
&quot;demand response&quot; in which big users like companies agree to cut back 
on hot days). New England's all-time peak usage was Aug. 2, 2006, when it hit 
28,130 MW. (1 MW is roughly enough to power 1,000 homes).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So Texas is well over twice our maximum and is likely to continue there for 
many days as 100-plus-degree temperatures continue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for me, I was out on the Souhegan River this morning, gathering water 
samples in crisp, gorgeous 60 degree weather. (The post-Irene river was so high 
that for the first time in five years of sampling, I couldn't wade out into it, 
but stayed next to the bank.)</p>

<p>Why aren't more power lines buried? It's expensive, and no panacea</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Concord Monitor has a good article today, as power gets restored to the 
region, about why more power lines aren't buried, kept away from falling trees.
Here's the story. Here are some money quotes:</p> 
<p>After the ice storm in 2008, when thousands of New Hampshire residents were 
without power for a week or more, the state Public Utilities Commission hired a 
Colorado engineering firm to study the prospect of burying the state's power 
lines. The firm, NEI Electric, concluded it would take 40 years and cost $40 
billion to bury the state's existing power lines.</p> 
<p>Underground lines are less vulnerable to high winds, falling trees, ice and 
snow, NEI Electric said, but perhaps more susceptible to other hazards. Those 
include flooding, lightning, rodent and human damage to the ground, and 
earthquakes.</p> 
<p>The consulting firm and the Public Utilities Commission decided the 
advantages of burying lines did not outweigh the costs, which have been 
estimated to be 10 times higher than stringing lines overhead.</p>

<p>A self-driving farm tractor from a Massachusetts firm</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Google might want to make self-driving cars, but a self-driving farm 
tractor should be a lot easier. (No worries about other drivers!) In Cambridge, 
Mass.,Jaybridge Robotics has done that with a John Deere. The company claims 
&quot; The driverless system is fully controlled by advanced software and is 
capable of performing a complete workflow during the harvest process. This 
includes locating a moving harvester in the field, synchronizing with it, 
collecting its grain and delivering that grain to trucks near the field for 
transportation.&quot;</p>

<p>Utility: A 'smart grid' could reduce storm outages</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A two-way power grid that notifies utilities of outages and power anomalies 
- part of the &quot;smart grid&quot; proposal that we hear so much about - 
could reduce outages due to storms, or at least reduce the amount of time 
needed to fix outages. So says ComEd, a Chicago-area utility,as reported in 
this Daily Herald story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ComEd would have known customers were out of power without them having to 
call us. Technology would have pinpointed outages allowing us to dispatch crews 
more quickly to restore service. Digital automation would have rerouted power 
or corrected a problem before an outage occurs meaning fewer customers would 
have seen outages, and thousands of customers may have never experienced an 
outage. With the June 21 storm, we estimate that 100,000 customers would have 
never experienced an outage. With the July 11 storm, we estimate that 
approximately 175,000 customers would have never experienced an outage.</p>

<p>N.H. joins suit to stop online ads for drugs, sex</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the Union-Leader today:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Attorney General Michael Delaney and 46 other state attorneys general on 
Wednesday requested information about how the website Backpage.com attempts to 
remove advertising for sex trafficking, specifically advertisements that could 
involve minors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The letter says the website is a popular destination for individuals 
seeking to exploit minors and points to more than 50 cases, in 22 states over 
three years, involving the trafficking or attempted trafficking of minors 
through Backpage.com.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the U-L story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The situation has been going on for a while. Last year a 14-year-old sued 
the site's parent company, saying that the site knowingly allowed a convicted 
pimp to buy ads soliciting sex. The suitwas thrown out in December.</p>

<p>Electric cars can be home generators during blackouts</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>V2G is a TLA (three-letter acronym, although &quot;letter&quot; isn't quite 
right) standing for &quot;vehicle-to-grid,&quot; in which an electric car sends 
power into the grid, instead of drawing it out. This isn't an original idea: As 
early as 2007 (seemy post here, which includes the V2G initialism, I notice) 
people were doing this with a Prius.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now several Japanese companies ramping up electric-car production want to 
make the system easier, developing and selling modules that will draw out DC 
power from car batteries and make it available to your home AC system.

<p>How much would you pay for paperwork about a Civil War steam-powered 
airplane?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>RR Auctions, an online auction house in Amherst, has a bi-annual sale of 
stuff related to spaceflight and aviation. Most of it is cool but predicatble - 
old Apollo computers, a watch that went to the moon, a bolf from a Mercrucy 
spacecraft - but there's one incredibly awesome surprise: extensive 
correspondence by a guy who tried to develop a steam-powered airplane for the 
Confederacy during the Civil War. He called it &quot;a simple arrangement of 
machinery for navigating the air for purposes of transportation and travel, but 
more particularly with a view to operations of war in the present crisis.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It sounds like a <em>steampunk </em>novel plot, but it's real. Here's a 
link to the brochure about the collection.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Included are letters from the Engineering Bureau of the War Department of 
the Confederate States of America that frowned on the whole thing, saying that 
he exaggerated the power output of engines and misstated the role of air 
resistance. But back in 1863, a half-century before the Wright Brothers' 
success, nobody really understood this stuff, so maybe he was right. He 
certainly didn't give up, eventually writing to Jefferson Davis and making 
drawings of what looks like aradial piston-powered engine.</p>

<p>Satellite transmitter-tagged osprey heads from NH to South America</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A fledgling osprey carrying a satellite transmitter is heading from a nest 
in New Hampshire has started its long and perilous migration to South America. 
The young female osprey, named Saco, was equipped with the solar-powered, 
GPS-enabled satellite backpack when it was 6 weeks old at its nest at the Ayers 
Island Hydro Station in New Hampton in July. It was as part of a new project by 
the Squam Lakes Natural Science Center.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new tracking project is led by Iain MacLeod, Executive Director of the 
Squam Lakes Natural Science Center in Holderness, NH. MacLeod has studied 
Ospreys for more than 30 years and has monitored the growing nesting population 
in the NH Lakes Region since 1997. &quot;This project will allow us to track 
this bird continuously for up to three years as it migrates across the Equator, 
and is part of a larger New England-wide project spearheaded by Dr. Richard O. 
Bierregaard, a distinguished visiting research professor at the Department of 
Biology at the University of North Carolina,&quot; said MacLeod.&nbsp; 
&quot;Bierregaard has been studying Ospreys on Martha's Vineyard for 42 years 
and holds extensive experience using this satellite tracking system. After 10 
years, and more than 40 birds tagged (mostly on the Vineyard), his project is 
providing much-needed data revealing migrational differences among Ospreys and 
helping pin down where threats to the birds lie,&quot; added MacLeod.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two chicks were tagged in July, but the younger male chick didn't survive 
its first flight attempts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The osprey, sometimes called the &quot;fish hawk&quot;, is the only bird of 
prey in the world to feed exclusively on live fish. Their large size , huge 
stick nests (often on man-made structures, including light towers, channel 
markers and even buildings) and widespread distribution have made them familiar 
to many people. Once decimated by DDT, ospreys have recovered significantly in 
the last three decades and have recolonized most of their pre-DDT haunts.</p>

<p>Microwave oven made by Amana</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My sister has a nice microwave oven made by Amana. It stopped working so I 
volunteered to either fix it or recover the magnets from the magnetron and 
other bits and pieces. The problem was that the secondary had opened on the 
transformer. I scavenged a couple of ovens from the dump and one of them had a 
transformer close in size to the failed one. After replacing, the oven is as 
good as new. That's the first one I've seen that the transformer has failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There isn't much to go bad in these. Once in a great while a diode fails 
but the usual problem is an accumulation of grease on the window that lets the 
energy into the food compartment. Too many cheese pizzas and not enough 
cleaning can start a smoky fire. The usual cure, (after throwing it out on the 
lawn) is to get a new one. Cleaning it up properly makes another oven for a 
college student or other needy person. I've only seen one or two out of a 
hundred or so fixed that have a bad control board. All in all, these appliances 
are very reliable and seem to last forever. Ours here at home is about 24 years 
old and is still running fine.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After stripping out the secondary, the transformer makes a nice 1+ kw 
transformer for a spot welder with a couple of secondary turns or, with more 
windings, any voltage you want. I have a bucket full of microswitches, so I 
don't collect those any more. The sheet metal goes to the metal pile at the 
dump. The control boards go into the electronics recycling box. Nothing goes to 
landfill.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The magnets from these are great. They are round doughnuts about three 
inches in diameter. They are strong enough to be useful but not strong enough 
to be dangerous. One unique application I do is to cover the truck cab with a 
tarp before a snow or ice storm. The tarp is held in place by a few of these 
magnets. I also use them to hold jigs in place on the table saw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I just got back from a few days down south and am catching up &hellip; but 
as yet another storm dumps yet more record rain on parts of the region, I 
thought I'd remind everybody of the excellent headline the Telegraph put on a 
column of mine back in May: &quot;Unusually wet or dry may become usual.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The column did some rudimentary analysis of historic rainfall totals at the 
National Weather Service station in Concord. It found that the decade of the 
2000s had by far the most &quot;abnormal&quot; years: &quot;Between 2001 and 
2010, eight of the 10 years had precipitation levels outside the normal range. 
That includes the wettest, second-wettest and third-wettest years on record, as 
well as the third-driest year on record.&quot;</p>

<p>Why aren't more power lines buried?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column this week asked why more power lines aren't buried, to 
get out of the way of ice storms, hurricanes and falling trees. The short 
answer: Buried lines also fail, from water, animals, shifting soil and errant 
construction crews, and do it more often than you think; also, they're much 
harder to fix than overhead lines, which almost negates the reliability 
advantage - but mostly, it just costs too much.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the column.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's an assessment of the 2008 ice storm power outage, with discussion of 
the topic in Appendix B.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article has a number of comments at the bottom, many angry at me 
because they want PSNH to bury a portion of the controversial Northern Pass 
proposal, in the extreme North Country. In general, the discussion is pretty 
good.</p>

<p>Another newspaper-online business idea: Divide (the site) and profit 
(hopefully)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Although it's distressing to live inside it, the collapse of newspapers' 
century-old business model (journalism subsidized by advertising) has been 
interesting to watch, now that different papers are trying different ways to 
get people to pay for online news.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Most are doing a version of the Telegraph's plan: You can read a certain 
number of stories per month for free - a move designed to grab the occasional 
drive-by reader from Google - but after that you have to pay, or (even better!) 
subscribe to the print edition, which still makes the large majority of our 
shrinking income. The vast majority of the website content also appears in 
print.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Boston Globe just announced a different idea: It's going to keep its 
long-running (since 1995) Boston.com site free, which will &quot;include 
summaries and headlines of stories on BostonGlobe.com, but you must be a 
subscriber to read those stories in full. Boston.com is also in the process of 
adding two dozen new blogs, primarily related to business, consumers, and 
nightlife.&quot;&nbsp; But today it launched BostonGlobe.com, a $3.99/week site 
which &quot;will combine the newspaper's print stories with breaking news on a 
site designed for customers who want premium content they can read on multiple 
devices, from computers to tablets to smartphones.&quot;Here's the announcement.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can see BostonGlobe.com free for this month. I suspect the 
&quot;multiple devices&quot; aspect of the site which will draw viewers, as the 
Era Of The Personal Computer slowly draws to a close.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dan Kennedy, a longtime Boston-area media-watcher, argues that the sites 
were set up this way, usting HTML5, partly to avoid paying Apple a chunk of 
subscription revenue:His column is here.</p>

<p>My last Netflix red envelope</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>LIke a lot of people who use Netflix, I am doing what Netflix wanted me to 
do when it jacked up its rates: Dropping the DVD option and going 
streaming-video-only (which we watch on TV via Roku). The last red envelope 
showed up in the mail today, about five years after we first subscribed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I suppose this is a sort of minor cultural moment, like the start of cable 
TV or when video stores stopped renting videos, or when I dropped America 
Online. Or something.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's yet another blow to the Post Office, if nothing else. Netflix made up 
as much as 5% of my incoming mail.</p>

<p>Dartmouth, UNH got $12 million-plus from National Science Foundation last

<p>Dartmouth and UNH are neck-and-neck in terms of National Science Foundation 
funding, according to an analysis for Mass High Tech. Dartmouth got $12.98 
million, UNH got $12.26 million. They're the only two N.H. institutions in a 
list of the 30 places which got the most NSF money in 2010.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>MIT and Woods, with about $75 million each, are virtually tied for the

<p>What do 1,570 derelict lobster traps look like on the ocean floor?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A 4-day sidescan sonar survey around the coastal waters of Portsmouth and 
the Isles of Shoals found 1,570 lobster traps appear to be derelict, shifting 
around on the ocean floor endangering wildlife. That's the conclusion of a 
study by various environmental groups, which includes this interesting 
observation:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While derelict gear is considered marine debris, it hard to determine what 
impacts it has on the environment, and marine life. In some cases, gear can 
even get so encrusted with marine life that it becomes an artificial habitat. 
&quot;From an ecological standpoint, it is difficult to quantify what impact 
these derelict pots have on the marine habitat,&quot; added Ken La Valley, 
Associate Director, of NH Sea Grant.&nbsp; &quot;When we retrieve the gear, an 
analysis will be conducted to identify their associations with vertebrate and 
invertebrate animals.&quot;</p>

<p>Luring tree-eating invasive bugs with sight, not smell</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have previously mentioned the triangular purple boxes seen hanging in 
some trees, which are lures for emerald ash borers, put out to detect the 
leading edge of infestations. The NY Times has a good article (read it here) 
today on how those traps, so different from most phermone-using insect traps, 
were developed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Biologists examined the insect, which has relatively big eyes, and figured 
it was more visual than most. Then they had to decide on what color lured it, 
so they tried a bunch.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The deep purple, it turned out, was the beetles' antennas-down favorite. 
Mr. Mastro theorizes that the bugs link the color to the purplish hue that can 
be seen on the inner bark of ash trees. But no one knows for sure. With the 
color decided, the team had to settle on the right shape. Four-sided traps gave 
them the most surface area, but manufacturing three-sided prisms was far 
cheaper. Each one costs about $9.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To enhance the traps' ability to attract beetles, Mr. Mastro said a 
chemical lure was added. The most effective proved to be manuka oil, an extract 
from a tree that has been used by Maori tribesmen in New Zealand to treat 
certain illnesses. (Manuka is widely used in the West for aroma therapy.) Each 
lure packet contains a blend of manuka and other scents and costs $5.</p>

<p>Steripen ... looks like magic, but it kills germs in water.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UV light water purifiers seem more like magic than technology</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My daughter got one of those ultraviolet-light water purifiers for use in 
camping, to kill bacteria so you can drink water from streams and lakes. We 
tried it on a camping trip, and nobody got sick so I guess it worked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But the darn thing feels more like magic than technology. You turn it on, 
making the end glow blue, stick it in your water bottle, then wiggle around for 
20-30 seconds until the light goes off, indicating it has done its job. There 
is no visual or other sensory cue that it has done anything at all; you might 
as well be waving chicken feathers or placing it the bottle a magic pentagram 
drawn in the sand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I guess I'm way behind the times, though: a little wikipedia-ing shows that 
the concept has been around a long time. The 1903 Nobel Prize for medicine 
concerned using UV against tuberculosis!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the product: Steripen</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even after your hearing decays, hearing protection makes sense</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From Earle Rich: I've had tinnitus (ringing in the ears) for years. 
Fortunately, it has subsided so that only in quiet environments do I even 
notice it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Back when I was a kid, my hearing loss was pretty severe due to blocked 
eustacheon tubes, frequent colds and adenoids that needed to be removed. After 
all that abuse, I have one ear that is way down in sensitivity and the other 
with mild loss. Once I got my hearing back, it was a long time before my brain 
was trained to ignore background noise. I couldn't reject the normal sounds of 
radios and people talking around me. I was experiencing sensory overload all 
the time. Now, that isn't a problem. My only issue now is that loud noises are 
literally painful. A child screeching, power tools, something falling, all 
these hurt!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a result of getting functional hearing back, I'm very careful about 
exposure to loud sounds. I have three sets of hearing protection headsets in 
the shop, always within easy reach whenever I turn on a power tool. I never run 
the chain saw without earplugs or headsets. So, in my 70s, I can hear about as 
well as I could in after I achieved adulthood.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What really bugs me is when I see other people ignoring hearing protection. 
The usual excuse is, &quot;My hearing is already poor, so what's the use?&quot; 
What these people don't realize is that noise damage is accumulative: Loud 
sounds destroy those tiny hairs that allow the ear to recognize soft sounds. 
Once those sensors are damaged, they don't recover. Tinnitus is the almost 
inevitable result of abuse.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A recent article on www.physorg.com about new findings on tinnitus shows 
that the problem is being addressed in a couple of different ways. Drugs, only 
tested on animals but having serious side effects, may lead to new medical 
cures. A better way seems to be a method of retraining the brain so that 
damaged nerve cells can have lower sensitivity. Either way, it's good that 
tinnitus is being recognized as a serious medical problem.</p>

<p>The Ig Nobels are coming! The Ig Nobels are coming!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Ig Nobels awards are coming (Thursday, Sept. 29, at Harvard as usual) 
and have a YouTube promo (a clever one, of course) here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pwbX9q9cBc&amp;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The event is sold out, alas, but will be live webcast at 
http://www.youtube.com/improbableresearch andhttp://improbable.com/ig/2011/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This will be the 21th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.&nbsp; Organized 
by the science humor magazine Annals of Improbable Research (AIR), in 
cooperation with several Harvard student groups, it features genuine Nobel 
laureates to hand prizes to the winners, including Dudley Herschbach 
(chemistry, 1986), Rich Roberts (physiology or medicine, 1993), Jack Szostak 
(physiology or medicine, 2009), Roy Glauber (physics, 2005), Eric Maskin 
(economics, 2007), Peter Diamond (economics, 2010) and Louis Ignarro 
(physiology or medicine, 1998). One of them will also be the prize in the 
Win-a-Date-with-a-Nobel-Laureate Contest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last year (2010) the honorees included: Italian scientists who demonstrated 
mathematically that organizations would become more efficient if they promoted 
people at random; New Zealand doctors who showed that people slip and fall less 
often on icy footpaths if they wear socks on the outside of their shoes; and a 
Chinese/British team who scientifically documented fellatio in fruit bats.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The theme of this year's ceremony is Chemistry. The night will begin with 
Tom Lehrer's classic song &quot;The Elements&quot; performed by Harvard Medical 
School professor Thomas Michel and Nobel laureate Rich Roberts. [Hear a 
recording of Tom Lehrer himself performing the song, athttp://bit.ly/9NujcJ]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ceremony will also include:</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; &quot;Chemist in a Coffee Shop,&quot; a new mini-opera 
starring Maria Ferrante, Roberta Gilbert, Thomas Michel, and Daniel Rosenberg.
</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; A tribute to Professor William Lipscomb, 1976 Nobel

<p>A glimmer of hope for bats dying from white nose syndrome</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A study of bats with white-nose syndrome in 2009 has produced a blimmer of 
hope. 30 brown-nosed bats, one of the two species being wiped out by the 
disease, caused as the result of a fungus, were given &quot;supportive 
care&quot;, which basically meant they were kept warm and dry, for 70 days, and 
25 of 26 showed &quot;significant improvement&quot; without the need of 
treatment, such as cleaning with distilled vinegar.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the first glimmer of hope that the fungal disease isn't going to 
exterminate cave-dwelling bats in the U.S. The report was published in the 
Journal of Wildlife Diseases in July.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My wife, a veterinarian, liked the way they described that the bats were 
confirmed to be infected with G. descrucans, the wonderfully-named fungus, by 
the use of &quot;a noninvasive fungal tape method.&quot; This, she explained to 
me, means they put Scotch tape on the bats, pulled it off, then examined the 
sticky side under a microscope. She does that herself to find various skin 
parasites and diseases.</p>

<p>Do you know who Bob Swanson is? (Think Edison, Jobs, Hewlett &amp; Packard

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In a gesture that is, depending on your point of view, cheezy or 
intriguing, a half-dozen &quot;walk of fame&quot; stars have been placed in a 
sidewalk on Main Street in Cambridge, Mass., honoring inventor/entrepreneurs.
The Globe has a story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are six stars. I recognized Thomas Edison, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, 
Mitch Kapor, and Bill Hewlett and David Packard, but I was stumped by Bob 
Swanson. Turns out he founded Genetech, which helped launch the whole biotech 
scene around Route 128, making him more than worthy of enshrinment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Biotech has never really grabbed my interest, although I can't say why. It 
certainly has enough intellectual, business and ethical complications to keep 
any observer fascinated for a lifetime.</p>

<p>UNH to study gamma rays with a balloon called GRAPE (wonderful acronym)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By David Sims, UNH News Service:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Beginning Sunday, September 17, 2011 at NASA's launch facility in Fort 
Sumner, New Mexico, space scientists from the University of New Hampshire will 
attempt to send a balloon up to 130,000 feet with a one-ton instrument payload 
to measure gamma rays from the Crab Pulsar, the remains of a supernova 
explosion that lies 6,500 light years from Earth. The launch is highly 
dependent on weather and wind conditions, and the launch window closes at the 
end of next week.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Gamma Ray Polarimeter Experiment (GRAPE), which was designed and built 
at the Space Science Center within the UNH Institute for the Study of Earth, 
Oceans, and Space (EOS), is an effort to apply a new type of detector 
technology to the study of celestial gamma rays.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Specifically, the goal of the GRAPE project is to study the polarization of 
gamma rays from celestial sources. &quot;Polarized&quot; radiation vibrates in 
a preferred direction, and the extent of that polarization can provide clues to 
how the radiation was generated, in essence serving as a probe of the source.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Gamma rays, such as those emitted from the Crab Pulsar, are generally 
produced from the interactions of a highly accelerated beam of subatomic 
particles &acirc;&#128;&#147; massive ejections of high-energy particles that 
are thought to take the form of a narrow jet moving outward at nearly the speed 
of light.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We think that an accelerated beam of particles is the source of the 
high-energy radiation from the Crab Pulsar, but the structure of that beam and 
the mechanism by which the radiation is generated is not entirely clear,&quot; 
says mission lead scientist Mark McConnell, a professor in the SSC and chair of 
the UNH department of physics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Detecting gamma-ray polarization can provide astrophysicists with a better 
understanding of particle acceleration, a ubiquitous and important but poorly 
understood process that generates radiation and occurs throughout the universe 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; from Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) to pulsars and 
black holes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Mexico-based flight, which could last as long as 40 hours, is not 
designed to reach the ultimate goal of the project &acirc;&#128;&#147; to study 
gamma-ray bursts. Achieving that will require a follow-up flight over 
Antarctica where the balloon, due to circumpolar winds that occur between 
December-January, would circle the pole for 30 to 40 days.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Says McConnell, &quot;To study the gamma-ray burst phenomena we need much 
more time because they occur randomly in the sky at a rate of about once per 
day and last at most a couple of minutes.&nbsp; So a long flight will be 
required to measure a number of bursts.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, McConnell notes, a successful, short-duration demonstration flight 
should provide the best measurements of the polarization of gamma rays 
emanating from the Crab Pulsar to date because of the sophistication of the 
instrumentation &acirc;&#128;&#147; the &quot;polarimeter&quot; detectors 
developed at UNH &acirc;&#128;&#147; capable of making the difficult 
measurement. &quot;We should be doing some very useful science on the Crab 
Pulsar during this flight and we only need 24 hours to do that,&quot; he says.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The concept of GRAPE has been developed at the SSC over the last 15 years 
and in 2007 the first small-scale demonstration balloon flight took place using 
a single polarimeter to prove the concept. In its current incarnation, GRAPE 
uses 16 polarimeters designed and built at the SSC. For a full-scale flight 
over Antarctica, 32 of the detectors will be used to monitor the sky for 
radiation from gamma-ray bursts and solar flares.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The upcoming GRAPE flight will also serve as an engineering test for two 
other UNH experiments that will piggyback a ride on the balloon. The Fast 
Compton Telescope, or FACTEL, will be flown to see how well it handles the 
radiation environment at high altitudes in order to assess its design.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>FACTEL (an effort led by UNH physics professor Jim Ryan) is based on work 
SSC scientists and engineers did in helping build the Imaging Compton Telescope 
(COMPTEL) onboard the 17-ton Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) that was put 
orbit in 1991. FACTEL represents an effort to demonstrate the latest 
technologies required to produce an upgraded version of COMPTEL, which should 
be vastly more efficient and produce much sharper imagery.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A second engineering test being performed on this flight, led by research 
assistant professor Peter Bloser, involves a new type of detector technology 
known as silicon photomultipliers. These devices are used to read out signals 
generated by radiation detectors. This represents a new technology that may 
prove valuable for many NASA space applications.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>High-altitude balloons, with a volume of up to 30 million cubic feet (large 
enough to contain a football field) have been used to carry NASA experiments to 
the edge of space for more than 50 years. They provide a vastly cheaper and 
less time-consuming approach than satellite-based missions and afford an 
excellent opportunity for student research projects. Three physics graduate 
students are working on the current flight as part of their Ph.D. studies and 
several undergraduate students have also been involved in the flight 
preparations.</p>

wild salmon. The international firmCooke Aquaculture has a number of salmon

<p>Safety Belt Use</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a new statistic on automotive safety belt use in New Hampshire. 
It's now up to 75% although past years percentage wasn't mentioned. To me, it's 
no mystery. Any recent vintage car or truck has an alarm that sounds 
intermittantly unless the drivers belt is set. It would be difficult to disable 
the alarm (although I know a couple of easy ways). So, people buckle up just to 
keep the damned thing silent. I've always used lap and shoulder belts without 
fail, going as far as to install them in my first cars that didn't come with 
them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So, perhaps the high use isn't a matter of educating the public as it 
should be attributed to the car manufacturers.</p>

<p>New Hampshire's most famous UFO abduction was 50 years ago today</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What's the most famous thing to ever happen in New Hampshire? For a certain 
segment of society, it just might be Betty and Barney Hill's reported 
interaction with a UFO on Route 3 near Lincoln, which occurred 50 years ago

<p>Map geeks unite, you have nothing to lose but your obsession over coastline 
lengths</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I love maps, and I suspect many of you do, too - it's a geek-ish thing. 
Maps are a perfect combination of utility, beauty, engineering, mathematics, 
mystery and a bunch of other cool concepts. What's not to love?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Slate has a review today of a new book by Jeapordy uber-champ Ken Jennings 
called &quot;Maphead&quot; which details the world of the map-obsessed. Part of 
the discussion is how Google Earth and GPS have removed some of the mystery 
from maps, which is true. As a post-collegiate, I sometimes killed an hour by 
going into the library of a nearby university, hunting up the map room, and 
looking at road maps of the Sahara while fantasizing about future journeys. Now 
you can call up satellite views of the deepest desert in almost real time. 
That's a good thing, but it does have drawbacks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Jennings' first book &quot;Braniac,&quot; about trivia buffs, was 
surprisingly good; I figured it would be a lame pseudo-celebrity tome but it 
was fascinating and well written. I think I'll put &quot;Maphead&quot; on my 
Christmas list.</p>

<p>Reintroduced wild turkeys becoming a problem out west - a sign of things to 
come for us?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The re-introduction of the wild turkey in New Hampshire has been incredibly 
successful. They were extirpated for a century before being returned from New 
York state to the Keene area in the late 1970s and then expanding throughout 
much of the state.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The public reaction from a sighting have evolved over the years from 
&quot;holy cow, is that a wild turkey?!?!&quot; to &quot;cu-u-u-u-te!&quot; to 
&quot;hurry up and cross the %$!#* road so you'll stop blocking my 
commute!&quot; Familarity breeds contempt.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've long wondered if turkeys' success will send them down the Canada goose 
route, turning them into such an outright pest that we start killing them 
outside ofthe spring and fall hunting seasons. In Colorado, it seems, that is 
already happening: According tothis article from The Westerner, &quot;Colorado 
wildlife managers plan to mobilize hunters to thin the thickening flocks of 
wild &acirc;&#128;&#152;conflict turkeys' that hinder farmers and 
ranchers.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have heard of farmers having some problems with turkeys invading fields 
in New Hampshire, although not to a great extent.&nbsp; I wonder how long 
before we hear the phrase &quot;conflict turkeys&quot; in the Northeast?</p>

<p>Nuclear experts to speak in NH</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>MANCHESTER &acirc;&#128;&#147; A nuclear plant official and a regulatory 
attorney will be speaking at St. Anselm College on Tuesday night about the 
nuclear industry in the wake of the Fukushima-Daiichi accident in Japan, and 
how the changes affect Seabrook and other New England nuclear reactors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The two are part of Clean Energy America, which is sponsored by the nuclear 
industry lobbying groupNuclear Energy Institute.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The discussion will be led by Will Cothen, a senior reactor operator at 
FirstEnergy's Beaver Valley Power Station in Pennsylvania and Amy Roma, an 
attorney specializing in nuclear regulatory issues with Hogan Lovells in 
Washington, D.C.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They are coming to New Hampshire partly because the operator of Seabrook 
Station nuclear power plant, FPL, has filed for a 20-year license extension 
with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which would allow for operations to 
continue until 2050. The Vermont Yankee plant, on the Connecticut River 
adjoining New Hampshire, may have to shut next year unless the state of Vermont 
OKs an extension for its operation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The two will appear at UNH in Durham&nbsp; at 3 p.m. and at St. Anselm at 6 
p.m.</p>

that branding was pure genius)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>None of the 22 MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; grants for 2011 went 
to New Hampshire folks, although three went to Harvard scientists. The Globe 
describes them as &quot;an economist who studies racial disparities, a 
physicist who probes the quantum behavior of ultracold atoms, and a clinical 
psychologist working to better understand suicide and how to stop people from 
harming themselves.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Each gets a five-year $500,000 award, no strings attached, and the 
knowledge of how they will be described on first reference in all news stories 
for the rest of their lives. Unless one of them wins a Nobel Prize, of course.

<p>The global warming debate gets people even madder than the atomic power 
debate</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It sounds like a weird geeky joke: What did the plastics engineer say to 
the physics professor after the contentious debate about atomic power? Answer: 
&quot;You're a global-warming-ist!&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Not a very funny joke, I grant you, but it was kind of funny to see.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It happened after a public talk Tuesday night at St. Anselm College's New 
Hampshire Institute of Politics, which hosted a couple of 
nuclear-power-industry folks to talk about the state of the industry, 
post-Fukishima. The session got a little testy at the end, with pro- and 
anti-nuclear folks interrupting each other and shattering the desired air of 
genteel PowerPoint academic discourse, leading an organizer to take the unusual 
step of insisting that the institute wasn't taking sides. Atomic power is a 
topic that, understandably, draws strong feelings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the funny, or funny-ish, part. One audience member, a plastics (<em>
see comment below, presumably from him</em>) engineer and business owner, 
started off his question with a diatribe against global warming because the 
speakers had touted nuclear power's carbon-neutral position. He holds the 
common, flawed belief that water vapor's role in warming is so great that human 
activitiy is irrelevant,answered nicely here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After the talk, a St. Anselm physics professor tried to explain the issue, 
but as they stood and talked the engineer demonstrated that 
smartest-guy-in-the-room attitude which turns so many people against the 
sciences and kept loudly interrupting. (He even called the physicist a 
&quot;global-warming-ist&quot;, a wonderful term I hadn't heard before.) 
Professors don't take kindly to being interrupted, so the physicist got mad in 
return. Voices were raised, and for a minute I sensed a small possibility of 
fisticuffs. It got defused, but not before demonstrating how contentious the 
topic of global warming has become&nbsp; - and showing some of the startled 
political-science undergrads in attendance that science isn't always boring and 
cold-blooded.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for the talk itself, the speakers, a power-plant engineer and a lawyer, 
were knowledgeable but came across as rah-rah corporate apologists (although I 
agreed with most of their points), while the&nbsp; anti-nuclear folks in the 
audience came across as long-winded fuzzy thinkers (although they had some good 
points lurking in the verbiage) so unfortunately I didn't find it very useful.

<p>Celebrating the dark night sky</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At Acadia National Park, they're celebrating the lack of light pollution 
with a &quot;Night Sky Festival&quot; (Short article here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have often thought that New Hampshire's North Country should apply to 
become anInternational Dark Sky Reserve, and use that in its tourist promotions 
- &quot;Come See the Milky Way, the Way Your Grandparents Did&quot;, or 
something like that. Of course, then people get really mad when it rains

<p>What are the odds you (or, worse, me) will be hit by NASA's falling 
satellite?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NASA says there's a 1/3,200 chance that somebody will be hit by a piece of 
Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite when it falls to Earth tomorrow (Friday). 
That sounds scarily high, but only because it's a global composite.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For each individual, the odds are only one-in-several-trillion (or maybe 
100 billion) that he/she will get hit - a number that factors in the facts that 
only certain latitudes are vulnerable and that populations are 
&quot;clumped&quot;, with lots of empty space where falling debris has zero 
chance of hitting a human.</p>

<p>Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PSNH says the &quot;scrubber&quot; at its biggest coal-fired power plant, 
Merrimack Station, is about a year ahead of shedual and could begin testing 
this week. The $450 million project is designed to remove 80 percent of the 
mercruy and 90 percent of sulfur from the emissions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the press release, which included the graphic I have attached here.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The scrubber produced one of New Hampshire's most ironic environmental 
debates last year. The&nbsp; high cost (roughly double earlier estimates) led 
environmentalists to say it was a waste of money, because it does nothing to 
cut carbon emissions, while PSNH insisted that the scrubbe should be built, 
partly because they get a guaranteed return on the capital expenditure. It was 
ironic because PSNH fought against the project when it was proposed in the 
early 2000s and environmentalists forced it on them.</p>

<p>NH biofuel startup hopes for $100 million from an IPO</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mascoma Corp. of Lebanon, which has been trying to tweak bacteria to 
develop a one-step way to turn cellulose into ethanol, plans to go public and 
hopes to raise as much as $100 million. I'm a little late on this:Here's a 
week-old Xconomy article.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've written about Mascoma since 2007, when &quot;ceullosic biofuel&quot; 
was a hot topic. The article is hidden within our archives and not directly 
linkable, but I do like this bit about why everybody wants to turn cellulose, 
the part of plants that holds up structures, into ethanol even though it's much 
harder than doing it with corn kernels: &quot;If it's so much work, why bother? 
Because plants make a lot more cellulose than seeds. Consider your own garden: 
Is it easier to grow weeds or strawberries?&quot;</p>

<p>A first look (for me, that is) at 3-D printing</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's a little hard for us outsider laymen to tell, but 3-D printing feels 
like it could turn into a truly revolutionary technology, doing to 
manufacturing what the PC and open-source software did to the computer 
industry. I have a long story about it in today's Sunday Telegraph (read it here
) with an emphasis on a couple of local companies that make and/or sell 3-D 
printers, as well as the folks at MakeItLabs who just gone one themselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you know much about the field you'll find the story pretty rudimentary - 
but hey, we've got to start somewhere!</p>

<p>Horse-drawn carriages collide due to &acirc;&#128;&#152;malfunction'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't want to be glib about this, because at least one person was 
seriously hurt, but in all my years on a newspaper I have never seen an 
accident report like the one from Applecrest Farm Orchards in Hampton Falls. it 
concerns what is described in Official Police-Speak as &quot;an incident* 
involving two&nbsp; horse-drawn carriages.&quot; From the police press release:
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Initial on-scene investigation revealed that each carriage was being drawn 
by two (2) horses and each carriage was traveling in an opposite direction when 
it appears that a portion of one of the carriages malfunctioned. As a result of 
this malfunction, the operator of each carriage lost control of the horses.</p> 
<p>Just goes to show that all technology is potentially dangerous, even old 
technology.</p> 
<p>* &quot;Incident&quot; is official terminology for anything from littering 
to a nuclear power-plant meltdown.</p>

<p>Giant air cannon destroying things by firing pumpkins at them ! Woo-hoo!!
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The annual Milford Great Pumpkin Festival is one of those family-friendly 
autumn events that take place around the country. Amid the scarecrows and pies 
and face-painting, they've long had an interest in public destruction related 
to pumpkins; for several years they featured a locally built trebuchet that 
flung pumpkins into Railroad Pond, trying to sink a boat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They've gone one better, however, with American Chunker, a massive air 
cannon that shoots 8-pound pumpkins almost a mile. This Saturday, the cannon 
(and it really<em>is </em>a cannon - an impressive 10,000-pound piece of 
machinery) will be firing pumpkins at a 30-foot camper, trying to punch holes 
in it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If that doesn't beat face-painting, I don't know what does.</p>

<p>Feds give loan guarantee to 99-MW wind park in Coos County</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 99-megawatt Granite Reliable Power Windpark (kind of a funny name for a 
wind farm, which isn't that reliable compared to fossil fuel plants) has gotten 
a $169 million loan guarantee from the federal government. That's about 
two-thirds of the cost of the 33-turbine farm, which will be only the second 
big windfarm in NH when it's finished. I'm not sure of the construction 
timeline: Here'sthe not-very-updated web site; here's the Department of Energy

<p>Could biofuel be made from wood using just water, not microbes?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even as New Hampshire's Mascoma prepares for a $100 million (they hope) IPO 
as they try to commercialize cellulosic biofuel, a firm down south says it has 
a way to turn wood into fuel that uses water, rather than complicated microbes, 
to break down those pesky cellulose walls. From a NY Times story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The process developed by Renmatix involves putting hardwoods into a small 
pressurized chamber. One class of sugars, the type with five carbon atoms, is 
broken off and harvested. The remaining material is pumped into a second 
pressurized vessel for a longer period to release the remaining sugars. 
&hellip; In both phases, the cellulosic material is treated by water at a 
pressure and temperature that is so high that the water is neither steam or an 
ordinary liquid but in a form known as &quot;supercritical.&quot; (Read the 
whole NYT story here) (Here's a CNET story)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It sounds interesting - alarming if you're Mascoma - but the technology is 
also at such an early stage that it'sh hard to say how viable it is. Turning 
lab technology into large-scale industrial processes is very, very difficult.

<p>UPDATE:It has been pointed out to me that one thing I didn't examine in my

mushrooms to provide, shall we say, a different experience. I don't know 
whether there are any species of &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; growing in New

that wind is an extra factor.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The first cruise liner to use Portland's new &quot;megaberth&quot; left 
three hours early Tuesday, stranding lots of people, because the opposition of 
the sun and moon made low tide particularly low, and the captain was worried 
about getting stuck. Passengers eventually were ferried to the Caribbean 
Princess in motorboats.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Presumably the cruise line hadn't factored all local depths during such 
&quot;astronomical low tides&quot;&nbsp; when calculating departure times.</p>

<p>The deadliness of sewer gas</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I wrote a few weeks ago about Nashua changing its unique triangular 
manhole covers, I noted that the cause is safety: They're too small to handle 
people wearing breathing apparatus.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you really need a breathing apparatus to go down in a sewer, some people 
asked me. The answer came tragically Tuessday in Maine, where two experienced 
workers died in a sewage pump tank because they'd been overcome by a sudden 
rush of hydrogen sulfide.A story about the autopsy is here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The gas is, says the wikipedia article, a &quot;broad-spectrum poison&quot; 
that It &quot;forms a complex bond with iron in the mitochondrial cytochrome 
enzymes, thus preventing cellular respiration.&quot;</p>

<p>Artificial photosynthesis - another good dream to pursue</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lots of cool technology is being worked on at MIT - the Globe could 
probably run a weekly column about it. The latest example, an attempt to create 
artificial photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using just 
light as a power source - the idea being to create hydrogen for fuel cells.The 
story can be read here &hellip; but make sure you don't miss the most important 
sentence, which could appear within the first three paragraphs of virtually any 
MIT-research story: &quot;The next step, he said, is to make the technology 
work on a large scale.&quot;</p>

<p>Is the total number of children in the world now at its maximum?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A Scandinavian professor named Hans Rosling has become famous in certain 
circles for his graphics-heavy analysis of world demographic trends - aging, 
population growth, economic patterns, etc. (You may have seenthis BBC video.)
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a story about him at GreenTech Media which is built on an 
interesting claim, that the washing machine has done more to improve human 
existence than any invention in history. But to me, the really interesting 
claim is that even though the world's population is going to rise another 2 or 
3 billion people, the sharp decline in birth rates means &quot;The total amount 
of children in the world, two billion, is not growing.&quot; The proportion of 
working-age people to children or, increasingly, of retirement-age people to 
children is going to soar, but the total number of kids running around may be 
at its maximum today. Amazing.Here's the whole interview.</p>

want to take a look at how sad they are:Here's the story.</p>

<p>New Hampshire<strong> dragonfly survey is a source of good news</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are two kinds of &quot;citizen science&quot; initiatives - those that 
get volunteers to sit at their computers and do stuff (e.g.,GalaxyZoo, the 
Mersenne Prime project) and those that get them to go outside and do stuff, 
usually searching for and recording wildlife. A perfect example of the latter 
is the New Hampshire Dragonfly Survey, which is winding up this fall after five 
years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today (read it here with some lovely photos) discusses 
its findings, which are all good news, unusually for environmental activism.</p>

<p>Storing electric heat in Maine homes is an interesting option</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tux Turkel in the Portland Press-Herald has a good story about a pilot 
program by the town-owned utility in Madison, Maine, to test &quot;electric 
thermal storage heaters&quot; that store electric heating when rates are lower. 
From the story (which has a great headline: &quot;Testing the Heat of the 
Night&quot;):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They foresee thousands of Maine homes and businesses cutting oil use with 
&quot;thermal storage&quot; heaters that take advantage of the cheaper 
electricity available at night in New England. In time, they see the heaters 
complementing development of wind power in the region, which tends to be most 
available in winter and at night.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Electric storage heaters convert &quot;off-peak&quot; electricity to heat 
and hold it in dense, ceramic bricks stacked in a heavily insulated cabinet. A 
thermostat and blower distribute the heat when needed. The heaters range from 
room units to whole-house models that also warm water. Costs run from $3,000 to 
$11,000.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Turkel understands technology, finance and energy, which allows him to put 
claims into perspective&nbsp; instead of just passing along whatever the 
advocate/entrepreneur/business says as fact.&nbsp; If only more news outlets 
had reporters like that!</p>

<p>Karner Blue butterfly in the Onion: If we go down, humanity will go down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire's best-known endangered species - the Karner Blue butterfly, 
which lives in a few pine barrens around Concord - &quot;writes&quot; a column 
in the current Onion that has this wonderful slant:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I swear to you on all that is good and holy that before the Karner blue 
goes extinct, myself and the last remaining members of my species will take out 
as much of the human race as we possibly can. There will be mayhem. Children 
will die. People will suffer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You think I'm kidding around? Keep messing with my habitat. Keep developing 
land and messing with my migratory patterns so that my food sources become even 
scarcer. Yeah, just keep on doing that and one night you're going to wake up 
with a knife to your throat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maybe then you'll take land conservation a little more seriously. But you 
know what? It will be too late.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Theft of historic documents from UVM library is a shocker</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The University of Vermont was one of several schools hit by a pair of 
thieves who, police said, swiped historical documents and sold them. Nothing of 
scientific interest was taken, but some material related to Franklin Roosevelt 
and other U.S. presidents was recovered by authorities,according to this 
Free-Press story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Old science/technology material can be valuable, of course, as Amherst 
NH-based RRAuctions demonstrates twice a year with its space/aviation auction (
some material here). I wrote about their latest auction, which included 
documents for a steam-powered flying machine that an inventor tried to sell to 
the Confederacy. The Confederacy's engineers were not impressed. (My story is 
here)</p>

<p>A free lecture on mechanical CAD at Nashua's &quot;maker-space&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nashua's new maker-space, MakeItLabs, has lots of cool tools that members 
can use (including almost-ready3-D printer) but what makes it really valuable 
is expertise - all those hacker/do-it-yourselfers whose brains you can pick in 
a loose, geeky-workshop atmosphere.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 18, they're going to take expertise-sharing a step further 
with their first lecture - about MCAD, or Mechanical Computer-Aided Design. The 
presenter will be John Nolin, a research project engineer at theUNH-Space 
Science Center, a program manager for DesignSmith LLC, chairman of ASME/NNE, 
Founder ofNH-SWUG, and formerly worked as a product specialist for Solidworks 
(the Merrimack-based 3-D printer firm).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It starts at 7:30 p.m., titled &quot;An introduction to basic MCAD 
techniques and tools for creating 2D laser cutter profiles or 3D shapes for 
simple milling and rapid prototype production.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This presentation is free, and open to anybody, even if you're not a 
MakeItLabs members. Just emailadam@makeitlabs.com if you would like to attend, 
so that we will have a rough idea on head count.</p>

<p>N.H.'s inventor of GPS says warrantless GPS tracking should be illegal</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Roger Easton, whose realization that clocks needed to be up in the 
satellites in order for the Global Positioning System to work led to patents 
that give him the title &quot;father of GPS&quot;, is among those asking the 
U.S. Supreme Court to ban GPS tracking by police without a warrant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Easton, who now lives near Canaan, N.H., filed an amicus brief arguing that 
&quot;law enforcement use of GPS without a warrant violates Americans' 
reasonable expectations of privacy.&quot;Here's a BoingBoing story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I interviewed Easton last year, when he was admitted to the National 
Inventors Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Transcribing old Royal Navy weather reports for 'citizen science'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I write a lot about &quot;citizen science&quot; projects, most recently the 
New Hampshire Dragonfly Survey, but I don't participate in them (unless you 
count CoCoRaHS, a rainfall-measuring program). Since I spend a lot of time at 
the computer, I figured I should sign up for an online program, to fill in idle 
moments.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I went to Zooniverse, which hosts a variety of these (including the 
best-know, GalaxyZoo, which gets people to help categorize deep-space objects) 
and after some pondering have joinedOld Weather. It uses volunteers to 
transcribe scanned-in weather reports from Royal Navy vessels around the time 
of World War I, giving some baseline data about world weather. A screenshot is 
shown at left.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Using old records like this to provide real-world baselines is not uncommon 
in science. I wrote a while back about a program to transcribe century-old 
records of fishing catches at New England ports, to give oceanographers some 
idea of fish populations in previous years.</p>

<p>BoingBoing Steve Jobs memorial</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The classiest Steve Jobs remembrance</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Every site on the Web has something about Steve Jobs' death, but BoingBoing
's redesign of its site into &quot;classic Mac&quot; fashion is the cleverest, 
I think.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A good year for returning Atlantic salmon (relatively speaking)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire Figh &amp; Game says more than 400 returning adult salmon 
were captured at the Lawrence, Mass., Fishway in 2011 - topping the modern-day 
record of 332 returning salmon in 1991. This success meant that&nbsp; 
biologists at the federal fish hatchery in Nashua had more broodstock salmon 
than they needed to produce the one million salmon fry that will be released in 
New Hampshire next spring as part of the Anadromous Fish Restoration Program, 
so they're releasing more big fish in New Hampshire riversfor anglers to pursue.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The program to return Atlantic salmon to New England hasn't exactly been a 
roaring success, since there's no realistic hope that a viable population will 
exist any time soon. There are so many variables in anadramous fish (spawn in 
fresh water, live in sea water) - the trips up and down rivers (the Merrimack 
is blocked by three large dams), the need for clean rivers to spawn in, the 
rising chance of getting caught at sea, higher temperatures changing ecosystems 
- that it's very very tough to make it work these days.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Did Steve Jobs' alternative therapies shorten his life?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Steve Jobs spent nine months or so using special diets and other 
&quot;alternative&quot; treatments, rather than surgery, after he was 
disagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When they didn't help, he turned to surgery 
and real medicine. He did pretty well, considering - living an active life for 
another 6 years - but you have to wonder whether he'd still be around if he'd 
gone under the knife more quickly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Daily Beast has a good long look at the issue: read it here. It also 
discusses how his controversial liver transplant (he jetted to another state 
where he could, basically, jump the queue and get ahead of other patients) 
might have actually harmed him.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Can leaf-peeping be made scientific? Start with color standards</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As part of a good, comprehensive AP story about the way foliage change is 
getting later (read it here) I discovered the National Phenology Network, a 
citizen-science initiative to gather information about how plants and animals 
are changing as the climate does.&nbsp; One of the things it is doing is 
&quot;coming up with standards to be used by observers in reporting foliage 
color change.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can't have good science without good measurements, and you can't have 
good measurement without good standards.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Similarly, UNH's Barry Rock has been doing spectral analysis on satellite 
photos of the state during leaf-peeping season to quantify changes. He has told 
me of evidence pointing to a dimming of color, perhaps due to what seems to be 
a decline in sugar content in maples.UNH magazine, by coincidence, has a big 
story about this just out.</p>

<p>Energy grid plans to start factoring in home efficiency</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ISO-New England, the folks who run the region's power grid, had a big 
presentation for reporters yesterday.This long AP story hits most of the 
highlights, including our increasing dependence on natural gas and the fact 
that some aging coal plants are likely to be shut down in coming years, putting 
a strain on the system.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One thing that came up at the very end of the talk, however, is that ISO-NE 
is trying to figure out how to factor in all the various building-efficiency 
programs when making future predictions about what is needed. At the moment the 
efficiency push, like localized power production (e.g., home solar), isn't big 
enough to be a factor in overseeing a system that deals with up to 30,000 
megawatts of production at a time - but Gordon van Welie, ISO-NE's chief 
executive officer, says that's going to change. The system is studying the 
issue and expects a report next year detailed how they will factor in 
efficiency programs (such asBetter Buildings NH) when deciding, say, whether 
closed power plants need to be replaced at all.</p>

<p>Does winning an Ig Nobel help, or hurt, a scientist?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Ig Nobel awards have come and gone for the 21st year, leaving harvard's 
stately Sanders Theater slightly shell-shocked at having been home to such 
shenanigans, and now it's time for an important question (important to 
scientists, anyway): Does winning an Ig help or hurt a researcher's career?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Science Careers Blog pondered this weighty question - you can read the 
whole piece here. They reach no particular conclusion due to lack of data, but 
the story contains some interesting comments from Marc Abrahams, the power 
behind the Ig throne, about how some senior scientists have rejected 
nominations: In such cases, &quot;Tthe senior scientist saw nothing funny about 
his (it's always a he in these cases) work and was highly, almost violently, 
offended that anyone (especially his own team) found pleasure and amusement in 
what they had done.&quot;</p>

<p>A New England tradition: Marking property lines with blazes in 'witness 
trees'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a fascinating article in the Bangord Daily News about &quot;witness 
trees&quot;:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Although &quot;witness tree&quot; is the name often given to trees that 
were in the area where certain historic events took place, such as the Battle 
of Gettysburg during the Civil War, their fame in New England is for their 
roles in marking boundaries.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The idea of individual, private land ownership registered with a 
governmental entity, now called a register of deeds, was new when Europeans 
began settling the Americas.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;This was a new concept &acirc;&#128;&#148; keeping records on paper 
that showed a connection between ownership and land,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Witness trees were used to designate property boundaries by towns, 
farmers and developers. Blazing with an ax or chiseling the name of the owner 
into prominent trees on properties was very common.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article talks about researchers finding old pieces of wood kept in a 
Registry of Deeds office from the late 1700s, when they were entered as 
evidence in a land dispute case!</p>

<p>Steve Jobs was brilliant, but he sure could be a jerk</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All the hagiography for Steve Jobs is well deserved on the business front, 
but I'm glad I never worked for him. Jobs suffered from &quot;smartest guy in 
the room&quot; syndrome - he was the &quot;doesn't suffer fools gladly&quot; 
kind of guy who believes that rules don't apply to him because he's special. 
It's more bearable for Jobs than for most such folks because he was special, 
but nonetheless that attitude is pretty damn hard to swallow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Case his point: His habit of parking his very expensive sports car in 
handicapped parking spaces - because, of course, he's too important to waste 
time walking from a space that's farther away from the door. Those rules are 
for us little people.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wonderful quote in that post, by the way:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Quipped former Apple executive, Jean-Louis Gassee, when he saw Jobs park in 
a restricted spot: &quot;I never realized those spaces were for the emotionally 
handicapped.&quot;</p>

<p>Today's techno-contemplation: 'Will the e-book kill the footnote'?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last night at dinner my family got to discussing footnoes - my son is a 
math major and does all his work in a mathematics-symbol-heavy version ofDonald 
Knuth's TeX, and my wife and I were wondering how that worked. We oldsters 
reminisced about what a pain it was to make footnotes in the old typewriter 
days - you had to estimate the number of lines, count lines upward, determine 
when to stop the body, etc. That is one thing where technology has definitely 
improved things enormously.*</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But are footnotes themselves passe in the electronic age? This NYTimes essay
by a writer named Alexandra Horowitz says ebooks will kill them because it's 
killing the entire idea of a page, even though hyperlinks could be considered 
footnotes on steroids. From the essay:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even the audio book has solved the problem of how to convey footnotes. 
Listen to David Foster Wallace reading his essay collection &quot;Consider the 
Lobster,&quot; with its ubiquitous show-stealing asides: at a certain point, 
his voice is unnaturally distant, the result of a production trick intended to 
represent the small type of a footnote. Wallace's e-book was not immune to 
de-footnoting, though; all these crucial asides now appear at the end of the 
book in the Kindle and iPad versions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I like footnotes, kept close to the text they're discussing. They feel like 
a different &quot;voice&quot;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* <em>Along with eliminating carbon paper. (Yes, I had to put a footnote in 
this post.)</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case we forgot dry July was, the chart giving precipitation data at my 
house will remind us. (I wasn't involved for all of November)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A year's worth of precipitation data in my yard</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have been a precipitation-measurer for CoCoRaHS (a &quot;citizen 
science&quot; weather-watching project) for almost a year. They measure annual 
data from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 for meteorological reasons, and just released data 
for my site. I missed October and part of November, so it's incomplete, but I 
had 47.29 inches of water falling from the sky, including 62.5 inches of snow 
(which melted down to about 6-7 inches of water).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's hard to know what to make of this, since there's no historical data to 
compare it with &hellip; which explains why scientists work so hard to 
establish baseline data about everything.</p>

<p>A trip to Chocoura shows that foliage was less bed than I feared</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The foliage season has been so dreadful in my neck of the woods (due to a 
fungul outbreak,as I noted earlier this month) that I'd been afraid it was 
ruined everywhere. Happily, a day hike to Mount Chocoura yesterday showed that 
while it's not the best of seasons, and it's quite late in changing, there is 
color up north.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Portland Press-Herald has a good piece today about how warm weather has 
helped delay and mute the season:read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But don't get too optimistic: UNH Magazine has a good cover piece on 
continuing research by Barry Rock about how climate change is slowly making 
foliage season worse:Read it here. I've written about his work a couple of 
times, but it still makes me depressed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have always heard that Mount Chocoura, which is a little southwest of 
Conway, gives perhaps the best view for the hike in New Hampshire, and I wasn't 
disappointed. It's under 4000 feet and can be reached by some pretty easy 
trails, but provides eye-popping, 360-degree views of the Whites and Lakes 
Region. Like a bigger Mount Monadnock with more interesting things nearby to 
see.</p>

<p>Massive offshore wind farm gets (slightly) closer off Rhode Island</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UPDATE: NY Times Green Blog has a lot more about the plan, including a 
proposal to use a new type of rotor with 165-meter rotors - holy cow!You can 
read it here</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not much past the arm-waving phase but Deepwater Wind has made a 
federal application for a big wind farm in relatively shallow water well off 
Rhode Island - and I mean big: up to 1000 megawatts, which is more than twice 
the size of the beleaguered Cape Wind plan. It also would hook into both the 
New England and Long Island grids, providing one of the extra connections that 
the national grid badly needs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Details from Mass High Tech can be read here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another company, Neptune Wind, has proposed a 500-megawatt site in roughly 
the same area (which has good wind, relatively shallow water far from shore, 
and proximity to cities that want electricity). But as I say, this is still 
very iffy.</p>

<p>Boston<strong> of &quot;the future&quot; seen from 1900: Where are the 
moving sidewalks?</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Smithsonian has a great item about a 1900 Boston Globe article 
imagining Boston a century hence (i.e., roughly now). A sample:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>when the tides in the harbor will be made for furnish[ing] heat light and 
power, when every person will own his own automobile, or whatever it may be 
called in that day; when people have learned how to live longer and suffer less 
from sickness; when sewage and garbage nuisances will no more exist. &hellip; 
It is not too much of a task on the imagination to believe that women will have 
taken a much more important position in the business and political life than 
they hold today.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the other hand, the city doesn't have moving sidewalks (the ones in 
Logan don't count) or efficient pneumatic tube delivery systems. I love this 
paragraph:</p>

<p>What can the health of one stream tell us about the health of an entire 
river system?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From UNH News Service: University of New Hampshire scientists have received 
National Science Foundation funding to explore how small-scale ecological 
experiments can be applied to understand the behavior of entire ecosystems, 
part of the agency's nascent effort to investigate large-scale biological 
responses to climate and land-use change.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Professor William McDowell of the department of natural resources and the 
environment (NREN) and assistant professor Wilfred Wollheim of NREN and UNH's 
Institute for the Study or Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS) are part of a 
multi-institution project that will &quot;scale up&quot; measurements of 
fundamental stream or &quot;lotic&quot; properties, and the effects of aquatic 
animals on those properties, to predict characteristics of entire stream 
networks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;This project is looking at how we can scale fundamental processes of 
stream ecology to a whole-stream scale,&quot; says McDowell. &quot;We also want 
to learn how good our individual site-specific work is at predicting broad 
patterns across the continent.&quot; McDowell will conduct<strong> </strong>
field work in Puerto Rico on a tropical dry forest stream dominated by mullets 
and freshwater shrimp.<strong> </strong>He will explore stream metabolism 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; how carbon is produced, consumed and vented into the 
atmosphere &acirc;&#128;&#147; as well as nutrient retention and the effects of 
predators and herbivores on stream metabolism and nutrient cycling.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Across the North American continent, the SCALER experiment will be carried 
out in a tropical forest, a temperate mountain forest, a prairie, a northern 
evergreen forest, and a tundra. Small, medium and large streams in each area 
will be examined at scales of centimeters to tens of meters. Modeling will be 
done to scale measurements up to regional and continental levels.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Modeling in environmental studies is a way to tie together what we 
understand about various aspects of the environment so that we can determine 
how the entire system works,&quot; notes Wollheim of the Water Systems Analysis 
Group within EOS, who will conduct the core modeling to translate measurements 
in individual stream sections, or &quot;reaches&quot;, up to entire river 
systems and, ultimately, continental scales. &quot;The models I'll work with 
will help us to better understand how and why ecosystems are changing, given 
climate variations and various human activities.&quot;</p>

<p>For their project, entitled &quot;Stream Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem 
Rates (SCALER): Scaling from Centimeters to Continents,&quot; McDowell is the 
UNH principal investigator;<strong> </strong>Wollheim is co-investigator. 
Researchers at Kansas State University are leading the $3.3 million project, of 
which $741,000 will support the UNH research.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Part of the experiment will involve &quot;consumer manipulation&quot; 
within a measurable section of a stream by taking away or adding animals like 
aquatic insects or fish to see what effects these animals have on the overall 
stream processes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The experiments and modeling results will be relevant to ecology as a whole 
because few &quot;coupled and nested&quot; experimental and theoretical scaling 
exercises have been undertaken in any environment. A coupled, nested 
environment is one that links many smaller parts with a larger whole 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; in this case, the overall flow of water links different 
stream reaches into a larger river network.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Says Wollheim, &quot;Very few studies have tried to understand processes 
across these different scales to determine, for example, how does carbon 
storage measured in individual stream reaches relate to carbon storage of an 
entire river network?&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Insight into how nature works at this level is necessary to understand both 
whole-system dynamics as well as to manage human impacts on entire watersheds.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NSF's large-scale biology program, a first for the agency, will tackle big 
questions in search of equally big answers: How will the biosphere respond to 
natural and human-induced changes across a range of time and space scales? What 
is the pace and pattern of the responses? What is the effect on ecosystem 
services, such as the availability of freshwater, across regions and continents?

<p>You don't have to tell Newfoundland that moose are bad for cars, as this 
road sign (so much more graphic than New Hampshire's &quot;Brake for 
Moose&quot; logo) demonstrates</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The world's most dangerous animal is the moose - if you're a car driver, 
that is</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Slate's excellent Explainer column today examines the question &quot;Which 
animal makes for the deadliest hazard on the road?&quot; and concludes, 
&quot;probably the moose.&quot; As it notes: &quot;few potential roadkill have 
the moose's combination of size, speed, and proximity to traffic. Camels and 
horses may be similar in speed and size to moose, but they tend to be tied up 
or confined.&quot;You can read the whole item here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, this isn't a problem where moose don't exist. In Australia, 
kangaroos are the big issue; &quot;in Africa, a large antelope, like the giant 
eland, could do as much damage as a moose, but most of these animals graze a 
little farther from the freeways.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The item says the U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that 
&quot;about 5 percent of U.S. motor vehicle collisions, or between 1 and 2 
million crashes per year, involve animals. That number reflects an increase of 
approximately 50 percent between 1990 and 2004&acirc;&#128;&sup3; due largely 
to the increase in the deer herd all over the country.</p>

<p>Mass.<strong> battery firm A123 may power GM's electric &quot;city car&quot;
</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>General Motors is likely to announce (soon, so reports say) that it will 
develop an all-electric &quot;city car&quot; based on the Spark model that they 
sell overseas. Acording to Greentechmedia, it will be powered by nanophosphate 
lithium-ion battery packsfromA123 Systems of Watertown, Mass.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the Greentech Media piece.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the GM website for the Spark.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even cooler than an electric car is a Segway-based personal transportation 
pod, which GM has been talking about:CNet news item here. I'm not holding my

<p>GraniteGeek is the blog of the year, says state press association</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is New Hampshire's 2011 Blog of the Year Best Blog (I looked at the 
plaque more closely), says theNew Hampshire Press Association, which gave me 
the award today at its annual dinner - a luncheon this year, since times are 
tough in the new business.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I believe this is the first year they've given a Best Blog award, and it's 
quite possible that no other newspaper even entered the category, so I'll try 
not to get too swollen a head.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But I do have to ponder the fact that I have previously won awards* for 
writing stories. Now it's for writing blog posts. Next year I hope to win Tweet 
of the Year, and then perhaps after that I'll win Adjectival Subclause of the 
Year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is, actually, some news coming out of the ceremony: The association, 
which represents daily and non-daily newspapers, will allow digital-only 
journalism publications to join - which means Patch.com, with a half-dozen 
bureaus in the state.&nbsp; I'm not sure if there are other freelance blogger 
types who'd want to cough up membership dues, but that would be very cool.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* If you've been a newspaper reporter for more than five years and haven't 
won at least one award, you aren't trying &hellip; we love to give each other 
awards.</p>

<p>UNH says digital books save class &quot;more than 
$70,000&acirc;&#128;&sup3; in textbook fees</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From UNH News Service: A digital textbook program launched this semester at 
the University of New Hampshire Whittemore School of Business and Economics has 
saved students more than $70,000 in textbook costs, the university claims.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The e-textbook initiative is the result of a textbook licensing agreement 
between the Whittemore School, the UNH Bookstore and open textbook publisher
Flat World Knowledge. The formats available include an online web book; 
print-it-yourself PDF; e-book for an iPad, Kindle or other tablet; and 
audiobook for an iPod or MP3 player. A low-cost print-on-demand option also is 
available for students who prefer a physical book.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Digital delivery of the e-text package is managed by the UNH Bookstore, 
which assigns a unique authorization code to each student for access to the 
course content that doesn't expire and can be transferred from device to device.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The majority of UNH's digital books are offered on the&nbsp;free NookStudy 
platform, which allows students to&nbsp;highlight materials, link to 
websites&nbsp;and course notes, and create study guides for exams straight from 
the textbook.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to its digital textbooks, Flat World Knowledge offers an open 
licensing model that allows instructors to revise, remix, and incorporate their 
own contributions so their textbooks more directly relate to the focus and 
learning objectives of a specific course.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While UNH has been expanding its digital textbook offerings, this is the 
first time an entire class has used only a digital textbook. Instead of 
purchasing hard copies of their textbook, the more than 600 students enrolled 
in Prof. Ross Gittell's &quot;Introduction to Business&quot; course at the 
Whittemore School of Business and Economics paid just $33.25 for unlimited 
online access for the term.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Conventional hard-cover textbooks average $150 each. Textbook prices have 
increased 22 percent over the last four years, quadruple inflation, according 
to the Student Public Interest Research Groups. The College Board estimates 
that students spend an average of $1,137 for textbooks and supplies each year.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Students are benefiting from substantially lower textbook costs, as 
well as from having immediate access to their course materials from the first 
day of class,&quot; said Ross Gittell, the James R. Carter Professor at the 
Whittemore School. &quot;A textbook licensing model of this kind has the 
potential for significant universitywide savings, while increasing educational 
opportunities for more people that can help grow our economy.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Approximately half of the textbooks sold at the UNH Bookstore have the 
digital option, which saves students an average of 60 percent off the price of 
the printed book, the store&nbsp; said. This fall, students saved $88,500 by 
opting for the digital version of textbooks at the UNH Bookstore, which 
includes Gittell's students.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;It is very convenient to find the information you're looking for 
right on your computer where students do most of their work anyway. The online 
textbook was so much cheaper than the rest of my books and, in some cases, it 
is better than my hard copies ,&quot; said first-year student Chris McPhee of 
Marshfield, Mass., who is taking Gittell's class.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Gittell and two colleagues have written new chapters on sustainability and 
business and public policy that weren't in the original version of 
&quot;Exploring Business&quot; by Karen Collins, one of the two digital books 
used in the &quot;Introduction to Business&quot; course.</p>

<p>Underground cables face problems, too - like hungry rats</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Many years ago, when the independent Hollis/Wilton Telephone Company still 
operated the phone system in those two towns (its now part ofTDS), Hollis lost 
its DSL service for a day or two because a squirrel got into an overhead cable 
box and gnawed through a cable. (Or maybe it was dial-up that was lost, since 
it was that long ago; I forget exactly.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We all thought this was a hoot, but maybe we should have been kinder: 
roughly the same thing happened to most of the broadband in Scotland recently, 
when a rat chewed through a buried fiber-optic cable.Read the story here.</p>

<p>Dennis Ritche (creator of C, Unix) was at least as important as Steve Jobs
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire's Linux uber-dude Jon &quot;maddog&quot; Hall pointed out to 
me the disparity in news coverge between the death of Steven Jobs and the death 
within the past week of Dennis Ritchie, who wrote the C programming language 
and co-created Unix.&nbsp; &quot;&quot;The death of someone who argumentatively 
affected more people in a positive way (both directly and indirectly) than 
Steve Jobs did&quot; has gotten almost no popular press, he noted sadly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's obvious why, of course - iPod/iPhone touched more lives in an obvious 
way than Unix, although the reverse might be true if you look under the hood - 
but Hall was still a bit annoyed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So I point to Salon which a remembrance today, calling Richie &quot;the 
geek Prometheus&quot; -read it here. The NY times has a story (here) as does 
the Wall Street Journal (here)</p>

<p>'Manipulating' a lottery by using knowledge instead of dumb luck is, 
apparently, a bad thing</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>State-run lotteries are, as the saying goes, a tax on the mathematically 
ignorant. Occasionally, the application of math and effort can beat their 
ridiculous odds, as happened occasionally in a game called Cash WinFall in 
Massachusetts. The game &quot;rolls down&quot; unearned winnings into lower 
tiers, which means that at certain points it becomes statistically worthwhile 
to buy lots and lots and lots of tickets - as various groups have done for 
years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Boston Globe has another big story on the process, including the fact 
that some lottery officials looked the other way, or even assisted groups in 
mass-buying tickets, because the sales looked good.You can read the story here.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The interesting thing to me, however, is the tone of the story: It regards 
these people who legally maniulated the lottery through knowledge - instead of 
hoping for blind luck - as being unpleasantly tricky or even downright thieves. 
Consider this line: &quot;It appears that an extraordinary lapse by lottery 
officials last year allowed a group led by an MIT computer whiz to 
single-handedly hijack the game, winning more than $2 million - nearly the 
entire jackpot from a single drawing.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Hijack&quot;?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Or this line: &quot;Their vast winnings came at the expense of regular 
bettors who play the game.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I think they should be celebrated as entrepreneurs. Interesting.</p>

<p>Compressed natural gas gets more popular as a trash-truck fuel</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nashua has bought nine new trash trucks that burn compressed natural gas. 
There's a hefty upfront cost (up to $40,000 per $200,000 truck, due largely to 
the cost of the tank, which has to hold gas under 3,600 psi) but lower fuel 
cost and lower maintenance cost down the road - and big environmental benefits, 
of course. I was told that up to a third of the new trash trucks in the country 
burn CNG rather than diesel.</p>

software.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This week, company representatives will make formal presentations on their 
products to the judges and up to five finalists will be selected to present in 
front of a live audience at the 2011 POY event held on November 14 at the 
Radisson Hotel-Center of NH in Manchester. The finalists will also be awarded 
the Product of the Year Judges' Award at the event.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The entire audience casts their vote for their top product after the 
presentations are made. The audience vote counts towards 50% of the final 
tabulation and the initial judge's vote counts for the remaining 50%. The 
winner will be announced at the conclusion of the event and will earn the 
NHHTC&nbsp;Product of the Year crystal trophy. The trophy and the finalist's 
winning product will be on display at the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.

<p>On Saturday, N.H. gets its first SkeptiCamp</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An unusual event is coming to the state this Saturday. It's called 
SkeptiCamp, a mix of high-speed university lectures, intellectual magic shows 
and do-it-yourself curiosity, designed to inform and illustrate about aspects 
of silliness-puncturing skepticism. It takes place from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in 
The Barley House restaurant in Concord.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The camp consists of a dozen short (most last just 15 minutes) lectures and 
demonstrations about topics dear to the skeptics heart, including:</p> 
<p>* How (and why) to make a bed of nails</p> 
<p>* Probability basics for skeptics</p> 
<p>* The Sugar Myth</p> 
<p>* Irrational Stock Market</p> 
<p>* Mathemagics</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The presenters come from around the region, many involved with Granite 
State Skeptics, the loosely organized group which is hosting the event.Learn 
more at the wiki here. The camp is cohosted by the James Randi Educational 
Foundation.</p>

<p>More online paywalls - this time for The Telegraph</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Telegraph has joined the legion of newspapers hoping they can make 
money by charging people to read content online. As of today, you can read 25 
articles (not counting classifieds or the home page) per month for free.* If 
you want more, buy a subscription (<em>please!!!!</em>)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A subscription costs $13/month, either digital only or with a 7-day 
newspaper subscription, and costs $6/month with Sunday subscription. We want 
you to buy the print paper, folks - that's where the advertising money lies 
(such as it is these days)!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the &quot;Account Center&quot; if you'd like to learn more: 
https://home.nashuatelegraph.com/clickshare/subscriptionCenter.do</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We're not exactly trend-setters. BostonGlobe.com ended its free test today 
and now costs real money (Boston.com remains free) and most papers in NH 
already have similar paywalls. The big exception is the Union-Leader - it holds 
back some stories from the Web so you have to buy the paper to see them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It will be interesting to see how this all works out. My paycheck hopes it 
works, although my browsing habit isn't happy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>*More if you do various cookie-cleaning browser tasks, although I think 
we're trying to squelch that</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the digital-only currency, crashes</p>

<p>I haven't tried to use Bitcoin - anybody out there have any experience with

Unfortunately for those who have invested, its price has crashed,as ArsTechnica

<p>Power Sockets and Plugs</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A little information on power sockets.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You might have noticed that sockets installed in a hospital are installed 
with the ground opening up, opposite from those in a typical home. The reason 
is that if a plug is partially pulled out and something falls on it, the first 
contact is with the neutral or ground line. There is a much lower chance of 
someone being electrocuted in that case.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What I take issue with is polarized line cords, those two wire cords with 
one of the plugs being wider than the other, used in battery chargers or other 
appliances that have plastic cases. There is no reason in the world why you 
should only have a 50% chance of inserting the plug right when using a 
hard-to-see outlet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I take the offending plug and either file or use the belt sander to match 
it to the narrow end. Problem solved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Digital privacy discussion at Science Cafe was a hit</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Science Cafe NH last night only drew about a dozen people - we blame 
the rain and the World Series - but the discussion was fabulous, two hours of 
informed give-and-take about digital privacy. It was exactly the sort of 
intelligent conversation that a room full of adults should have.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Diversity helped. The group ran the gamut in age from early-20-somethings 
to folks with grayer and/or less hair than me, and in opinion from :&quot;we're 
doomed&quot; to &quot;it's no big deal.&quot; The panelists (technology 
attorney Cameron Schilling and Comcast spokesman Marc Goodman) really made it 
work.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The issues was summarized well by one attendee, who said it boiled down to 
control - that technology has lessened our ability to control other people's 
knowledge about us, our habits, our whereabouts, our anything.&nbsp; In return, 
it has given us control over mind-boggling amounts of other information; the 
question is whether the trade-off is worth it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I asked everybody that question at the end - is the trade-off worth it? - 
and all but one person said yes, that the loss of traditional privacy was 
balanced by all the technical benefits it brings us. I suspect the one 
nay-sayer, an experienced uber-geek who name-dropped life at Digital Equipment 
Corp., was at least partly playing devil's advocate.</p>

<p>Today's offer: A free solar-flux-density detector for your back yard!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A &quot;citizen science&quot; program is being launched to help measure the 
albedo of winter snow cover in New Hampshire, via theCoCoRaHS volunteer 
precipitation-measuring program. I got a note last night from Mary Stampone of 
UNH, the state meteorologist and CoCoRaHS organizer (who was, incidentally, a 
panelist in the Science Cafe NH program on climate change last spring), saying 
that they had 20 pyranometers available for volunteers. I've included a sceen 
shot of part of the brochure, above.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A little wikipedia-ing showed me that a pyranometer is a solar flux density 
measuring device - basically a dome with black interior and various sensors 
that keep track of how much of each part of the solar spectrum is hitting the 
spot.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The devices are being offered as part of a three-year study aimed at 
monitoring NH snow cover and reflectiveness (an important piece of information 
for climate modeling). I can't get one, alas, because it requires a midday 
solar radiation observation at your test site, and at noon I'm at work not at 
home (unfortunately. But I'm sure that enough of the roughly 150 regular 
CoCoRaHS observers in N.H. will jump at the chance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Stampone atmary.stampone@unh.edu.</p>

<p>Meteor shower tonight - go, go, Orionids!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nine times out of 10 when I try to see a meteor shower it's either cloudy 
or the shower is a dud, but tonight's Orionids has potential. It will be clear 
and reasonably dark (the moon is waxing crescent), and not too cold considering 
the time of year. Maybe I'll set the alarm for 3 a.m. or so, and see what I can 
see.</p>

<p>Dangerous Toys</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Just read a list and supposedly funny descriptions of dangerous toys 
marketed during the glorious 50's. Some of these I had, the chemistry sets, 
glass blowing sets and a couple of others. The authors were trying to make a 
point of how it was amazing that any kids survived the contact with stuff that 
could maim and kill. It wasn't really that bad. I learned an awful lot from 
doing the experiments, far more practical experience than I ever got in our 
tiny school system. I know how to blow glass, mix chemicals safely and handle 
electricity and power tools. I was pretty intense about learning this stuff. 
Popular Science and Popular Mechanics were very good, having regular columns on 
chemistry and other technical subjects. That was my real education.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I pity kids now that don't have a real chance to risk life and limb. 
Computers are supposed to take the place of hands-on experiments. But, every 
time I get a kid in my shop and expose them to real tools, making outrageous 
amounts of noise and sawdust or metal chips, the seed is planted. Buying a 
computerized toy, sitting back and watching it go through someone elses 
programmed idea of 'fun' is just so limiting.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Maker Revolution is changing all that for the good. Kids and adults are 
getting very good at circuit bending, making electronics do what is needed 
instead of what was sold. Popular Science and Popular Mechanics have brought 
back the pages encouraging fun projects, even those considered dangerous and 
are supposed to be supervised by a cooperative adult. Make Magazine is full of 
great hands-on learning experiments.</p>

</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the link to that article I just read. Once you get past the 
sarcastic descriptions, don't you feel just a little envious that we can't now 
play with stuff like this? Those toys made my career as an engineer inevitable. 
I had a taste of controlling the world through electronics and mechanics. 
Thanks to Gilbert and other companies not too concerned about the legal system, 
I've had a great run.</p>

<p>Silly 'Bigfoot' film at Mt. Monadnock turns into a free-speech court case
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After state park folks at Mount Monadnock wouldn't let a guy make a little 
film involving him in a Bigfoot suit, he sued. The Globe's story today 
summarizes it thus: &quot;Though many elements of the dispute border on the 
absurd, the case raises some serious free speech issues.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the whole story (from Boston.com, not BostonGlobe.com, so it's free).
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's an NH Magazine story from earlier this year, with a nice picture of 
Doyle's Bigfoot suit, bought at the iParty store in Keene. It includes this 
insightful interview query:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is difficult to hike up the mountain in costume? &quot;Definitely tough 
to roam around in. The Bigfoot feet are like rubber slippers so your feet take 
a pounding. But it's for the love of the art!&quot;</p>

<p>Museum gets bigger</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Hampshire Aviation Museum is located in perhaps the coolest 
building of any&nbsp; museum around: The original terminal/control tower of 
what was then Grenier Field, now boring titled Manchester-Boston Regional 
Airport. The whole Art Deco building would probably fit on one luggage carousel 
at the current airport.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's cool, certainly, but it was also confining, which is why it's good 
news that the airport has expanded and is now open seven days a week. The 
Sunday Telegraph has a report (complete with video) -read it here.</p>

<p>Creating 'gas stations' for electric vehicles is a non-trivial job</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My column today talks about the chicken-and-egg difficulty of creating a 
network of charging stations for electric vehicles before there are any out 
there to use it. The same problem has afflicted other alternative fuels such as 
compressed natural gas, which is why you don't see many CNG cars around.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Transportation and environmental officials in 10 Northeastern states, 
including all of New England, are trying to create a plan that will make it 
easier.</p>

<p>Maine<strong> man drove his car 1 million miles and gets a hometown parade
</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I know a couple of people who are hoping to push their old cars to 250,000 
miles, but I've never heard of somebody racking up 1 million on a single car 
until I readthis Portland Press-Herald story. &quot;Joe is a testament to what 
you can do if you maintain your car&quot; is a quote from the story and it says 
a lot, although it doesn't hurt to own a simple reliable model (in this case, 
1990 Honda Acord). He got a parade in Saco, Maine, plus a new Honda.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story says the engine and transmission are original although &quot;the 
car's seatbelts, steering wheel and upholstery have worn out and been replaced. 
The fuel pump blew at 741,000 miles, drawing laughter from his kids when the 
car had to be towed.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let's see, a million miles in 21 years is about 48,000 miles a year. Even 
if he drove 60 mph the whole time, that's 33 days - more than a solid month - 
of sitting in your car every single year. Ugh.</p>

<p>Maine<strong> wood pellets -lots of them - are getting exported to Europe
</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Biomass energy (subject of the Science Cafe N.H. discussion in January, by 
the way) or creating heat/electricity by burning wood, is a weird stepchild of 
alternative energy - not very sexy, with its aura of old-fashioned throwback, 
but in this part of the world it's a big part of the potential mix for ditching 
fossil fuels. It's also part of the economic mix, as can be noted byplans in 
northeast Maine to build a mill that would make about 300,000 tons of wood 
pellets a year, 70percent for export to Europe, where biomass energy is well 
established.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wood energy is not an economic swap for the departed paper industry - in 
general, loggers get less for their wood because it's worth less per finished 
ton, and the mills don't employ as many people. But it's something, and 
Northern New England needs something.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a Press-Herald story, which notes that development of Maine's three 
deep ports (Portland, Searsport and Eastport) is key to such business.</p>

<p>UNH space scientists hitch rides with Japan and Europe</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some news from UNH (which includes a horrible forced acronym: &quot;cross 
Scale COupling in Plasma universE or SCOPE&quot;)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scientists and engineers from the University of New Hampshire's Space 
Science Center (SSC) have been selected to provide instruments for two upcoming 
satellite missions led by the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace 
Exploration Agency. The ESA Solar Orbiter mission will carry the Heavy Ion 
Sensor, which includes an ion composition telescope being built at UNH by a 
team led by research professor Antoinette Galvin of the Institute for the Study 
of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS) and the department of physics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Solar Orbiter will venture closer to the Sun than any previous mission. It 
is designed to make major breakthroughs in our understanding of how the Sun 
influences its environment, in particular how it generates and propels the flow 
of particles, known as the solar wind, in which the planets are bathed. Launch 
is slated for January 2017.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Ion Composition Time-of-Flight/Energy Telescope we're building 
for the satellite's solar wind composition instrument will do the actual 
particle measurement,&quot; says Galvin. &quot;So it's an essential role and 
one we're playing due to similar instrumentation we provided on NASA's STEREO 
mission. At this time we're the only U.S. institution still active in this 
particular field building this type of solar wind composition instrument.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The STEREO spacecraft, launched October 25, 2006 carries the UNH-built 
PLAsma and Supra-Thermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) instrument. Galvin is the 
principal investigator for the PLASTIC instrument, which measures 
characteristics of protons, alpha particles and heavy ions. STEREO has 
dramatically improved our understanding of the powerful solar eruptions that 
can send more than a billion tons of the Sun's outer atmosphere hurtling into 
space.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the JAXA &quot;cross Scale COupling in Plasma universE&quot; or SCOPE 
mission, a team led by professor Lynn Kistler was selected to proceed with an 
11-month mission concept study for UNH's Ion Mass Spectrum Analyzer (IMSA), 
which also draws on historical work done at UNH, such as the CODIF (composition 
distribution function) instrument developed for the ESA Cluster satellite 
mission.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>SCOPE will investigate fundamental physical processes that are key to 
understanding the functioning of the Earth's magnetosphere, as well as what 
drives solar flares, radio galaxy jets, supernovae remnants, and cosmic rays. 
The mission will put five formation flight spacecraft into the key regions of 
the magnetosphere.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The science is the next step after the on-going Cluster mission and 
the upcoming NASA Magnetospheric Multi-scale mission (MMS) that UNH is also 
involved in. Whereas those two missions use four spacecraft to study the 
physical processes at one scale &acirc;&#128;&#147; a larger scale for Cluster 
and a very small scale for MMS &acirc;&#128;&#147; SCOPE will look at the 
cross-scale aspects of these processes.&quot; says Kistler of EOS and the 
department of physics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The UNH SCOPE team has been given the go-ahead to conduct further work on 
the IMSA instrument. IMSA was only one of five selected by NASA from a field of 
20 Mission of Opportunity proposals submitted to the agency, which will fund 
U.S. components for the Japanese satellite. The UNH team will receive $250,000 
for the 11-month implementation concept study, after which NASA will determine 
whether the project goes forward.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For Solar Orbiter, UNH is a subcontractor to the Southwest Research 
Institute, the lead institution for the Heavy Ion Sensor (HIS). A team of 
national and international partners are also involved. UNH has already been 
awarded over $661,000 for the project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>N.H. firm makes high-tech versions of that laboratory staple: the pipette
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you've never used a pipette, you haven't worked in a laboratory, at 
least not a life-sciences lab. Moving tiny samples of liquid with back and 
forth between test tubes, petri dishes and other containers in order to see how 
the contents react or don't react, or grow or don't grow, or 
something-or-other, is the essense of a &quot;wet lab&quot;. But you can't do 
it without those little tubes called pipettes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Although I was never much of a &quot;lab rat,&quot; it was still fun to 
visit Integra-Viaflo, a Hudson company that makes electronic pipette tools, 
operated by iPod-ish wheels, that can transfer up to 96 different samples at 
once. I really like the handheld model with 8 pipette tips - it looks like a 
high-tech comb for an Afro - which can adjust the spacing between the tips with 
a touch of the button.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's my story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you only go to one Halloween party, MakeItLabs might be the one to try
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The wacky, geeky, do-it-yourselfy folks at MakeItLabs, the state's first 
&quot;maker space&quot; with tools and expertise for members to use, are 
holding a Halloween party on Saturday, and they're have a pumpking-carving on 
Thursday night.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The party sounds awesome, because if there's any place you're likely to see 
intriguing costumes, I would guess that MakeItLabs, which features both a 
hydraulic car lift and enough LEDs to light up City Hall,&nbsp; is the place.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for the pumpkin carving, how about this descriptive line to whet the 
appetite: &quot;Lasers and CNC machines may be involved.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The pumpking carving is open for all to see, as it will happen during their 
regular open house, starting at 6:30 Thursday.Directions are on their Web site. 
The Telegraph is sending a photographer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't have a lot of costume imagination, but for the past few years I 
have enjoyed Halloween night because my wife and I give out candy in front of 
the town cemetery (the crypt is right behind us), via our &quot;Haunted 
Hive.&quot; You have to reach inside the buzzing beehive - free downloadable 
bee sounds out of my iPod - to get your candy; my wife, hiding under the table, 
will grab your hand. We'd had some excellent screams from the 'tween female set.

<p>Real geothermal energy in NH? Probably not</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Map from SMU's Geothermal Laboratory showing underground temperatures 
available for geothermal energy. Green, in this case, isn't good.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two years ago I wrote about an MIT study which reached the surprising 
conclusion that the Conway, N.H., area was a potential hot spot (so to speak) 
for future geothermal energy production, because of the heat released by 
natural radiation from underground granite. It was the only location east of 
the Mississippi on the list, and it was very borderline in terms of producing 
cost-effective energy. (We're talking real goethermal, as in hot water turning 
turbines, not &quot;geo-heat-exchange&quot; as the term usually means 
hereabouts.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I never really believed it, and a new map coming out of research funded by 
Google, which likes geothermal a lot, supports that suspicion. The map from 
Southern Methodist University makes all of New Hampshire unhelpfully green - as 
in having too low a deep-underground temperature to be feasible.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the SMU press release.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Searching Google with '+' doesn't work any more, in preparation for Google+
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wired is reporting that Google has quietly stopped allowing the use of the 
plus sign in search fields to force searches - to create an &quot;and&quot; 
search - presumably so as not to conflict with searches among Google+ its 
Facebook wannabe. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, Google retired a longer-standing &quot;plus&quot;: the + 
operator, a standard bit of syntax used to force words and phrases to appear in 
search results. The operator was part of Google since its launch in 1997 and 
built into every search engine since. Unlike their other recent closures, the 
removal of + was made without any public announcement. It could only be found 
by doing a search, which advised the user to double-quote the string from now 
on, making &quot;searches&quot; look like &quot;awkward&quot; &quot;Zagat&quot; 
&quot;reviews.&quot; (Read the whole story, which has lots of detail, here.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The fact that Google, which has always been incredibly open about 
everything, did this on the sly seems pretty darn corporate - maybe not evil, 
but not Googleish.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fungus that causes 'white nose syndrome' in bats is identified; no easy 
solution</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Scientists is reporting that experiments have nailed down the species 
of fungus that is wiping out little brown bats through white nose syndrome, and 
confirmed that it passes via contact and not through the air.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Through complementary experiments in which the researchers housed 25 
infected bats together with 18 healthy bats, they demonstrated that bats catch 
the syndrome from each other through physical contact. It cannot spread through 
the air: healthy bats did not pick up the infection when housed near to, but 
physically isolated from, diseased bats. The experiments confirm what many 
experts had suspected, and rule out the possibility that the fungus preys on 
sick animals but does not actually cause the disease. (Entire article is here. 
Nature paper that it reports about is here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's no easy solution; you can't spray fungicide in every cave in North 
America. Vaccinations are possible, says the article.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not clear what this will do to the debate over whether caves should be 
closed to humans, out of fear they spread the fungus on clothing or equipment. 
Many spelunkers have opposed this move.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>SMU geothermal map</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geothermal energy near Conway, NH? Maybe it's not so far-fetched</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Apparently I was too negative yesterday when I said that mapping of 
geothermal energy potential by Southern Methodist University cast doubt on 
earlier claims that the area around Conway, N.H., in the eastern portion of the 
White Mountains, had the best possiblity east of the Mississippi. I seem to 
have been looking at either an outdated map or one with insufficient detail, 
because the map I found with Google (which funded the work) shows Conway as a 
real hot spot - as you can see here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'll have to look into this a bit.</p>

<p>FCC says rural phone fees should now pay for rural broadband</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has made a big change to the $4.5 
billion Universal Service Fund, which was created decades ago using money from 
a fee attached to telephone bills. It was created to extend phone service to 
rural areas, where there wasn't enough business to cover the cost of lines, but 
now most of it will be used to do the same thing with rural broadband lines, 
not rural voice lines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As Wired reports, this pits phone companies (which can use the fund) 
against cable companies like Comcast, which provide competitive phone service 
via Voice Over IP on their cable-modem systems. From the story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Given that the FCC &nbsp;is shifting subsidies from traditional phone 
carriers to high-speed broadband providers, it asked for public comments about 
its authority to regulate Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol calls, such as Comcast's 
broadband-based phone service. That's because it's legally unclear whether the 
FCC has the authority to regulate VOIP calls. That puts into doubt a 
complicated system of FCC-required payments between phone carriers, who 
reimburse each other via &quot;access charges&quot; as calls move to and from 
one another's lines.</p>

<p>'Incident at Exeter' UFO was lights from refueling tanker, say skeptics</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The latest Skeptical Inquirer magazine has an article by longtime skeptical 
investigator Joe Nickell which says the famous &quot;Incident at Exeter&quot; 
UFO sighting in 1965, basis of a book of the same name that is one of the 
best-selling UFO-related books ever, can be explained by the operations of a
KC-97 refueling tanker. The tankers were based at what was then Pease Air Force 
Base (it's now a civilan airfield) on the New Hampshire Seacoast, not far from 
where the myserious lights were spotted.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The key to the connection, the article says, is realizing that the tanker 
has five red &quot;sequencing lights&quot; under its better that fired in 
various orders in preparatio for the mid-air refueling with other jets. The 
Exeter UFO had similar lights.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flywheel-electricity firm Beacon Power files for bankruptcy</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UPDATE ON Nov. 1: CNet has a more extensive followup (read it here) with 
this alarming tidbit:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Earlier this month, two of Stephentown's 200-plus flywheels lost integrity
&gt; and melted into a &quot;cotton candy-like material&quot; hot enough to 
trigger an emergency water cooling system that, combined with the superheated 
materials inside, blew the tops off the half-buried, 3000-pound chambers,
according to one local news report.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the end, maybe spinning massive cylinders held in place with magnets in 
airless chambers at 16,000 RPM isn't the best way to store grid power. Still, 
flywheels hold theoretical advantages over batteries or fuel cells in that they 
have no chemicals that need to be replaced or kept out of the environment, and 
deliver efficiencies of 85 percent or more in terms of energy in versus energy 
out. And while flywheels can explode, so can batteries.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Original file, Oct. 31:</p> 
<p>Beacon Power of Tyngsborough, Mass., makes of privy-sized flywheel systems 
used to stabilize voltage on the power grid, has filed for bankruptcy. It got 
$40-some-off million in federal alternative-energy grants and loans, so expect 
more hollering akin to what is happening with Solyndra.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's my quickie story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a CNet follow up, commenting about how alternative energy firms are 
having trouble crossing the &quot;valley of death&quot; that consumes many 
startups - going from post-R&amp;D to self-sustaining commercial firm.</p>

<p>The Telegraph got the above photo submitted in the mail, one of several 
aerial pictures of wind turbines being installed in and near the tiny town by 
Dummer, Mass. According to the photographers, that's Mount Washington in the 
background. The pictures was taken by Rachel Andrews Damon, being flown by 
pilot Kenyon King. The windfarm has the grandiose nameGranite Reliable Power.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This photo shows two &quot;cutoffs&quot; on a utility pole near my house. 
They look sort of like a car's suspension system to me. The one one the left is 
fine; but the one on the right has had its fuse blown, so that it's hanging 
down like a flyrod or something. These blown fuses are the reason I didn't have 
power for two days (it just came back -woohoo!); when a tree hits the line and 
grounds it out, they blow. Much of what the local power company has been doing 
for days is driving around, finding blown cutoffs, getting tree companies to 
get the wood offf the line and then getting line teams to fix the fuse.</p>

<p>Warmth? Water? Light? Nah - in a power outage what's important is the 
Internet!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Great picture with The Telegraph's story today about people taking refuge 
from the widespread power outage at hotels, shops, etc. - it shows a bunch of 
people on the floor of Barnes &amp; Noble, fixated on their laptops.Check it 
out here.* And a great quote:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lowell, Mass., resident Robert Ellis made friends by bringing along a surge 
protector and letting other customers plug in some of their devices while he 
worked on his laptop.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We just hang out with nice people who let you use their plugs,&quot; 
said Hollis resident Juli Jasinski, who had plugged her cellphone into Ellis' 
power strip. &quot;You have to love New England. It's better than 
earthquakes.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>*assuming you have power, of course</p>

<p>Back-of-the-envelope number of the day: A leafy oak can carry 3,000 pounds 
of snow</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a story in today's Telegraph about the species of trees heavily 
damaged in the recent snowstorm, according to the county forester Jon Nute (who 
knows pretty much everything, in my estimation). One species hard hit was 
silver maple, which is no surprise&nbsp; - they're weak, fast-growing trees. 
The other, however, was oak - because they drop their leaves last, so they had 
maximum surface area to hold onto snow. I did a back-of-the-envelope 
calculation (half-million leaves, one in 10 holds an ounce of snow) and came up 
with a whopping 3,000 pounds of snow that could be sitting up there. An entire 
elephant worth of snow! No wonder the trees broke.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nute got it exactly right for me: I have oak and silver maple limbs all 
over the place.</p>

<p>Can you harvest the wind from bridge underpasses? UNH thinks maybe so</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UNH is wondering whether it is possible &quot;to use wind patterns from 
traffic and natural flow through bridge underpasses to harvest energy for 
powering lighting, signalization, emergency warnings and structural health 
monitoring systems.&quot; The EPA thinks this idea is interesting enough that 
it gave them $15,000 - hardly a vast sum, but it can't hurt - as part of its 
People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) grants.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the EPA information about their proposal.</p>

bankruptcy is so good that I'm just going to link to it - again!- and even seat 
their headline.</p>

the firm hopes to use Chapter 11 restructuring to keep going.Here's the article.

<p>Talk about angry birds: Burlington Airport fights a gull problem</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The law of unintended consequences strikes again: Vermont shut down a huge 
commercial composting operation because it was polluting nearby waters, so St. 
Michael's College started up its own composting operation. But it has attracted 
gulls, who are endangering flights at nearby Burlington Airport.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The south Burlington city manager has suspended &quot;the Firearms and 
Nuisance Ordinance, allowing airport officials to begin using pyrotechnic 
devices immediately,&quot; reports the Burlington Free-Press. I assume that 
means flash-bang devices to scare them, not shotguns to bring them down.Read

<p>Not as many wireless-phone-only homes in N.H. as I expected</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm doing a story about how wireless and cable modem communication fared in 
thestorm - the essence of the story is that nobody really knows because there's 
no regulatory oversight, like there is with electricity and landline phones; 
you have to depend on what the companies tell us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>During the reporting I stumbled across a study done by the Centers for 
Disease Control, of all people, about &quot;wireless substitution&quot; - an 
estimate of the percentage of adults living in households that have dropped 
landline entirely in favor of cells phones. New Hampshire is relatively low, at 
16 percent - fifth-lowest in the country. Oddly, it estimated that Rhode Island 
had the lowest wireless-only percentage; I say oddly because it's a flat, urban 
area, which seems ideal for good cell phone coverage.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here are some statistics:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>State - estimated % of adults in wireless-only homes</p> 
<p>N.H. - 16%</p> 
<p>Mass. (Suffolk County, which is Boston) - 25%</p> 
<p>Mass. (rest of state) - 15%</p> 
<p>Vermont - 20%</p> 
<p>Maine - 23%</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Republicans (yes, Republicans) co-sponsor a conference about dangers of 
climate change</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It seems that the issue of climate change has become so politicized that 
everybody assumes people worried about the reality of climate change can't 
possibly be Republican. How else to explain a brand-new group named (either 
apologetically or defiantly, I can't decide which)<strong>New Hampshire 
Republicans for Climate</strong>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I just got press material from it about an upcoming conference on the 
effects of climate change that is headlined &quot;Conservative Republicans 
Organizing NH Climate Conference.&quot; It goes out of its way to note that the 
group's chairman is a &quot;life-long Republican&quot; and that one speaker is 
a &quot;former Republican congressman&quot; who will discuss market-based 
approaches to tackling climate change.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's kind of sad that such emphasis is necessary, but such is life.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The group is co-sponsoring with the New Hampshire Carbon Alliance (which, 
if stereotypes run true, has very few Republicans) a conference in Portsmouth 
on Nov. 17 called &quot;Climate Change and New Hampshire's Seacoast.&quot; It 
will discuss how our scenic, albeit small*, coastline should prepare for rising 
ocean levels and more extreme weather. More information about the conference is 
here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a better link for the conference.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NH Republicans for Climate chairman is named Farrell Seiler, and he's 
giving a talk titled &quot;New Hampshire: Birthplace of the Modern 
Windfarm&quot; which I assume will be about Crotched Mountain. I wrote about 
that long-gone site years ago - it was very cool. I'll have to hunt up my old 
story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>*At approximately 18 miles, it's the shortest ocean coastline of any 
coastal state &hellip; unless you count tidal flats, which would bring the 
Great Bay into the equation and bump us up past Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Ranked voting (&quot;instant runoff&quot;) election coming for Portland's 
mayor</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Next Tuesday is election day. Portland, Maine, is holding its first race 
for mayor - and it will use ranked-choice voting to find a winner among the 15 
(good grief: 15!) candidates.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ranked-choice ballots let voters rank the randidates, from first choice to 
last. If nobody gets a majority of 1st-place votes, then the mathematical 
equivalent of a runoff election occurs by analyzing the 2nd-through-15th-place 
tallies. This is sometimes called &quot;instant runoff&quot; for that reason. 
Fromthe AP story:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ballot is too complicated to be understood by the city's voting 
machines, so only first-place votes will be announced on the night of the 
election, said Caleb Kleppner, vice president of TrueBallot Inc. The final 
outcome of the race won't be known until the following day when the ballots are 
scanned and all of voters' rankings are extrapolated, Kleppner said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Burlington, Vermont, had this system for three (I think) elections, but 
ditched it after the man who came in second in the tally of first-place votes 
was named mayor via subsequent calculations in 2009. The system is also used in 
Cambridge, Mass.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I wrote about this issue 18 months ago, it produced quite a lot of 
discussion, as youcan see here.</p>

<p>Seal deaths along New England coast lead to federal probe</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The continuing deaths of seals along the New England coast has led to the 
NOAA to launch a probe.Here's the official statement, which includes this:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From Sept. 1 to Nov. 3, NOAA's national Marine Mammal Stranding Network, 
the New England Aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Program and the University of 
New England's Marine Animal Rescue Center, have been working with NOAA to 
respond to a reported 146 seals strandings in Maine, New Hampshire and northern 
Massachusetts.&nbsp; Most of the animals were harbor seals less than a year 
old.&nbsp; This is more than three times the average number of strandings that 
typically occur this time of year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I spotted via the Union-Leader's daily mix of short links to other news 
sources,which they call headlines. Whoever compiles them does a good job of 
finding stories in weird places that are of interest to New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Wind farm law in little Antrim generates big debate</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's a relatively minor state/city election day tomorrow. One of the more 
interesting votes will be in little Antrim, which is proposing some wind tower 
control ordinances that would either help or hinder development of big (more 
than 100 kw) wind towers, depending on who you talk to.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Smart meters are coming to New Hampshire, too (How'd I miss this?)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ADDENDUM: Check the discussion below my column (here) - it's pretty 
informative stuff, with just a soupcon of ranting.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It was pointed out by a reader responding to the article below (about Maine 
Central Power installing smart meters) that New Hampshire Electric Cooperative 
is also installing smart meters. It's a smaller utility and a slower schedule 
(set to be done in spring 2013), but it's mandatory - no opt-outs - and 
otherwise just as interesting.Here's the FAQ.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm embarrassed that I missed it. NHEC operates up in the central part of 
the state, mostly from Sunapee up to Plymouth, so it's way out of our 
circulation area &hellip; not as far out as Maine, though.</p>

<p>Forensic study finds that &quot;human&quot; remains often aren't</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nice story in the NY Times (subscription probably required) today about how 
forensic study of grisly human remains often finds that they are actually 
animal bones. The story (here) is prompted by a story about a &quot;little 
child's foot&quot; that turned out to be a bear paw</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>About 20 percent of the cases that are vexing enough to involve a forensic 
anthropologist (in New York City) &acirc;&#128;&#148; typically cases involving 
skeletons or mummified or burnt remains &acirc;&#128;&#148; end up not 
involving human bones at all.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dr. Adams often encourages detectives to e-mail him a cellphone photo of 
remains shortly after they are discovered to see if &quot;I can make a spot 
call,&quot; he said. That way, he said, investigators do not waste time 
&quot;securing a crime scene to safeguard a cow bone.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've been trying to thin out our book collection in recent months, since it 
is overflowing the shelves and we don't have any obvious place to build new 
ones. One book I had forgotten about, handed down from a great-aunt's weird 
husband, was called &quot;Bones for the Archaeologist&quot;. It's a primer for 
archaeologists (surprise!) who find bones amid their digs and want to figure 
out what species they belong to. Judging from the book, it's much harder than 
you would think, particularly since digs have to take into account extinct 
species.</p>

<p>Portland, Maine's ranked-choice (&quot;instant runoff&quot;) mayoral ballot
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Take a look at the ranked-choice ballot in Portland's 15-candidate mayor 
race!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I wouldn't want to be a poll worker in Portland, Maine, today, as voters 
face their first ranked-choice ballot, which asks them to rank their 
preferences for the 15 candidates for mayor. I expect much complaining.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One result of the format is that officials almost certainly won't know the 
winner tonight, unless the unlikely event happens and somebody gets 50.1% or 
more of first-place ballots. It's going to take them until at least Wednesday 
to go through the sorting process to figure out the winner.Heres the 
Press-Herald story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here is the city's explanation of the system (PDF).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pictures like this are why people think the moon is a lot closer to the 
Earth than it really is. The moon is actually about 110 Earth moon diameters 
away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The moon is farther away than you think (so the asteroid is less of a 
concern than you think)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Part of the reason some people are getting unreasonably worried by asteroid 
YU55 passing &quot;between the moon and the Earth&quot; is that they think the 
moon is closer than it really is. You can blame most illustrations (like the 
one attached) which are draw at misleading scale if they were done to real 
scale you wouldn't see diddly-squat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The video linked below, spotted via Bad Astronomy, does a good job putting 
the distance in perspective. You should watch it, since it's entertaining, but 
for impatient folks here's the ending: If the Earth was the size of a 
basketball the moon would be the size of a tennis ball, and it would be 24 feet 
away. If a tennis ball was thrown 20 feet away from a basketball, would you 
think they were in danger of colliding? That's roughly what's happening with 
YU55.</p>

<p>Girl Scout &quot;localvore&quot; badge - not sure why they chose a radish 
(ugh)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Girl Scouts create a &quot;localvore&quot; badge</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The name &quot;localvore&quot; has an annoying hipster/treehugger ring to 
it, but it focuses on a real trend: The increased interest in eating food that 
is grown relatively nearby, and grown by relatively small farms that you can 
get to know.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Five years ago I was writing about Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) 
operations as a novelty, but now they're mainstream, as are farmers markets 
featuring real food, not just knick-knacks and flowers, as well as 
pick-your-own places. Localvore-ism is truly becoming part of the mainstream - 
maybe not as mainstream as Cheetos and McDonald's, but no longer a weirdo 
fringe activity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a sign of its acceptance: The Girl Scouts have created a 
&quot;localvore&quot; badge, shown here. You get it through five steps:</p> 
<p>1. Explore the benefits and challenges of going local</p> 
<p>2. Find your local food sources</p> 
<p>3. Cook a simple dish showcasing local ingredients</p> 
<p>4. Make a recipe with local ingredients</p> 
<p>5. Try a local cooking challenge</p>

<p>No easy winner in Portland's instant-runoff election, which enters the 
mathematical &quot;instant runoff&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Portland's race for mayor using ranked-choice ballots did not produce a 
winner last night - that is, nobody was 1st choice for a majority of voters - 
so poll workers are going through the process of testing lower choices.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Brennan, a former state senator, earned 5,240 first-place votes, or 26.7 
percent of the total on Tuesday. But Ethan Strimling, another former state 
senator, earned 4,390 first-place votes, or 22.4 percent, which left him 
&quot;within striking distance,&quot; he said. The city will conduct an 
&quot;instant runoff&quot; election today using voters' second- and third-place 
choices &acirc;&#128;&#148; and possibly fourth, fifth and so on 
&acirc;&#128;&#148; until one candidate has more than 50 percent of the vote.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Free-Press article (read it here) has a longer description of how it 
works. I can't find anything in their stories about how voting night went, so 
maybe it wasn't the long lines and confusion that I assumed it would be.</p>

<p>30-megawatt solar farm will be controlled by one PC, two guys</p> 
<p>In the high desert of southern Colorado, a 30-megawatt, 200-acre solar farm 
is being built. (That is 10 to 15 times the photovoltaic output of every panel 
in New Hampshire.) The amazing thing, as CNet reports, is that it will be 
operated by two guys using one PC.</p> 
<p>The $100 million plant comes with a heavy responsibility as only he and one 
technician will operate the plant from a small office a few hundreds yards from 
the panels. His main tool in monitoring the entire system is a computer back in 
the office hooked up to a network of sensors in the field.</p> 
<p>That is amazing from a technical point of view, although it also shows how 
certain types of &quot;green energy&quot; aren't going to be major job-creators.
</p> 
<p>Here's the story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Comcast begins IPv6 deployment</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Comcast, the biggest cable provider in New Hampshire (it's probably our 
biggest ISP and is one of the biggest telephone providers) has begun deploying 
native IPv6 in &quot;selected markets&quot;,according to the company 
announcement. I don't know if we're one of the markers, but in prevous IPv6 
stories I've been told that Comcast is way ahead of the curve in this issue. 
From the announcement:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Critically, our approach is 'native dual stack' which means customers 
will get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Some other ISPs that are less prepared 
may be using tunneling or large scale NAT in the network. Those approaches are 
likely to result in some applications (such as some real-time applications) 
breaking or seeming slow.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more details, check the release, which has links to technical blog.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The net result for most of us in the IPv6 transition will be nothing - the 
point of going to the bigger address space is to sidestep future problems.</p>

<p>Irene flooding carried 'rock snot' into a fish hatchery; 450,000 trout, 
salmon may have to die</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The flooding that hit Vermont from Tropical Storm Irene has produced 
450,000 potential new victims: trout and salmon in the White River National 
Fish Hatchery in Bethel, Vt.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Waters from places contaminated with the invasive algae didymo, a.k.a. 
&quot;rock snot&quot;, flooded into the hatchery, and officials are worried 
that the fish might carry the algae with them if they're released into the 
Connecticut River or Lake Erie basins. The fish might all be slaughtered, 
instead.Short AP story is here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm been fearfully awaiting the arrival of rock snot in southern New 
Hampshire; so far, it has only been found in the upper headwaters of the 
Connecticut River. It can be nasty stuff, and has overwhelmed many streams in 
New Zealand, among other places, choking them with its slimy presence.</p>

<p>&quot;When will my power go back on?&quot; Vermont smart grid helps answer 
that</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When there's a power outage, like the one that hit most of New England 
after the Halloween Snowstorm, the Telegraph (like every possible source of 
ionformation, private or govermental) is beseiged by people asking &quot;when 
will my power go back on?&quot; They don't want general information about 
percentage of customers returned statewide or town-by-town, which is the sort 
of stuff we know &hellip;. they want the restoration time for their street, 
their house. But we always answer, echoing the utility, &quot;it's too 
complicated to say exactly.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yet maybe it's not, if you're prepared with a good network. That's the 
argument in a story from Greentech Media about Vermont Electric Cooperative, 
which has networked line crews (who usually have very accurate estimates about 
power restoration) and used GPS to &quot;get the cusomer talking to the 
lineman.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers also have access to hourly data through a web portal called 
wattWATCHERS, which was built in house. The utility is also upgrading its meter 
communications platform, layeringSmartSynch's cellular solution on top of its 
PLC platform for next-generation needs, whatever those may be.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The article argues &quot;Many municipal and rural co-ops are more advanced 
in terms of smart grid when it comes to their investor-owned counterparts.&quot;

<p>Portland, Maine's ranked-choice (&quot;instant runoff&quot;) mayoral ballot
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Portland official confirms: The odd ballot didn't baffle voters, after all
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Voting Day in Portland, Maine's 11 precincts (including one on an island - 
cool!) went smoothly despite predictions from scaredycats like me that the 
instant-runoff ballot for mayor would baffle voters who had never had to rank 
15 candidates in a single race before. (Here's the wikipedia article explaining 
instant-runoff voting.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We told poll workers to call us and give us feedback if you get 
negative response (from voters), but we didn't hear any,&quot; Nicole Clegg, 
the city's communications director, told me in an interview this morning. 
&quot;Either voters had done their homework before they got to the polls, or 
once they got there they figured it out quickly.&quot; Even the voting itself 
didn't take much longer than usual, except that surprisingly high turnout led 
to some crowding, she said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Voters ranked some or all of the 15 mayoral candidates by darkening an 
oval, and traditional optical readers counted the results, leaving a hard-copy 
ballot for recounts. The city's machines could only count voters' first 
preference; on election night it was found that nobody got the 50.1% of those 
votes to win, so they went to step two the next day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That involved five scanners from a company called TrueBallot, which read 
all the ranked choices and uploaded them into the company's software. After 
some verification, it started crunching numbers, eliminating the 
lowest-taylling candidates one by one, until a winner was announced about 8:30 
p.m. Wednesday.&nbsp; Most of the candidates got so little support that a 
winner announced until 13 of them had been eliminated.&nbsp; The whole process 
drew quite a crowd, thanks to its novelty, Clegg said; the room was packed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Logistically it went very smoothly. The drawback is people are used 
to getting results the night of election,&quot; said Clegg. &quot;I'm certain 
we'll do a debrief, figure out ways to make it better.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Instant-runoff balloting was approved by voters in a charter referendum 
last year for the first mayor's race in 88 years (previously, the city council 
chose a mayor from its ranks). It will stay in place unless voters upend it - 
the next mayoral race is in four years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Advocates of alternatives to traditional &quot;choose-just-one-person&quot; 
voting say it does a better job of reflecting the electorate's overall 
preferences when there are more than two candidates in a race, and reduces 
certain ills of traditional politicking by forcing candidates to appeal to 
folks across the spectrum. Opponents say it's pointlessly confusing and doesn't 
accomplish anything.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Variants are used in a few elections here and there but have never really 
caught on in democracies: Cambridge, Mass., uses it, but Burlington, Vt. dumped 
it after a few elections.&nbsp; Some New Hampshire legislators wanted to study 
a variant of that procedure for our state, but that idea was shelved by 
lawmakers.</p>

<p>Precipitation throughout NH - can you spot the Mount Washington Valley?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Is New Hampshire weather really that bad?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm a volunteer precipitation-gatherer with the national Community 
Collaborative Rain Hail and Snow Network, aka CoCoRaHS. It has several thousand 
observers scattered throughout the 50 states. To help built meteorological 
enthusiasm, it has been running state climate summaries by each state's 
climatologist. Today it's New Hampshire, from UNH professor Mary Stampone (who 
was one of the panelists of the first Science Cafe NH, on climate change, last 
spring).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's titled &quot;Is Weather in New Hampshire Really That Bad?&quot; 
playing offMount Washington's self-branding as having the &quot;worst weather 
in the world.&quot; The answer, alas, is no - we're getting much more ordinary, 
as the current string of 50- to 60-degree early November days show.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was interested in the precipitation map she included, which I've shown 
here. No wonder I'm always getting wet when I hike in the White Mountains!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>UPDATE: Egypt closed the pyramids &quot;following rumors that groups would 
try to hold spiritual ceremonies on the site at 11:11 A.M. on Nov. 11,

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's 11/11/11, a numerologist's dream. I have a little story in today's 
Telegraph about a couple getting married today, although it was just the 11/11 
they wanted, the 2011 was a bonus. I couldn't find any surge in numerological 
weddings today, however.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Impressive events next week: Skeptics in the Pub, Science Cafe, Climate 
Change</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are three interesting events in New Hampshire next week for folks who 
like to think about and discuss important issues based on facts, instead of 
just rant about soundbites.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tuesday is Science Cafe New Hampshire - this month it talks about the 
science and math of public polls, particularly political polling. How do we 
know they work? As moderator, I will ensure that there's no discussion about 
(ugh) politics itself, just the mechanisms, strengths and failings of what has 
become a major part of American life. Tuesday, 7 p.m., at the Barley House 
Restaurant in Concord - free!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Monday is Granite State Skeptics in the Pub at the Shaskeen Pub and 
Restaurant, 909 Elm St. Manchester, 7 p.m. They often have great speakers; I 
think this month's session is more of a general talk about issues of interest 
to the skeptical community.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thursday all day (8 to 5) is Climate Change and New Hampshire's Seacoast, a 
big discussion and presentation, featuring a ton of high-level academics and 
industry folks, about how our coast should cope with rising seas and variable 
weather. This one costs money, at least $60, but it's a big deal - partly 
because it includes participation by NH Republicans for Climate, a group of GOP 
folks who think that political beliefs shouldn't make you ignore scientific 
reality. It's at the Portsmouth Harbor Events &amp; Conference Center</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>November 13, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Doesn't feel like winter, as big ski resorts tiptoe into opening</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Killington, which long prided itself as being open first and shutting last 
in the Northeast, has a tiny amount of advanced terrain open -600 vertical feet 
- while Maine's gigantic Sugarloafhas turned on the snow guns. But it might hit 
60 degrees here today and wont' get below freezing at night until the end of 
the week at the earliest. It feels more like early spring outside than fall -
faugh!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>November 14, 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The grass is always greener on the other side of the ISP</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've written a lot in the past two weeks about storm-related problems with 
Internet service (which, these days, often includes telephone service), but I 
have to tip my hat to the Union-Leader, which took a very clever angle on a 
story today that I wish I'd thought of. They found one guy so mad about Comcast 
cable-modem's outages that he switched to FairPoint DSL, and another one so mad 
at FairPoint's outages that he switched to Comcast. Ha!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You have to buy the paper to read it, though; they haven't put it online as 
part of their &quot;don't steal customers from the only place we make 
money&quot; strategy. They give youjust a tease online.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A portion of a map of geotagged wikipedia articles</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An amazing result from mapping Wikipedia articles</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You'll never guess what this map shows. since it shows such a clear outline 
of Georgia and a few nearby states. Maybe it's a map of moonshine distilleries? 
NASCAR fans? People who drop peanuts into their Cokes before drinking them?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nope -it's is a portion of the map of geotagged articles in the 
Arabic-language wikipedia. Yes, Arabic. For some reason, Arabic-speaking 
wikipedia editors are really interested in certain U.S. states, but not others. 
(What have they got against South Carolina?)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I snagged this surprising map from this BBC article about the project, run 
by the Oxford Internet Institute. It includes pictures of similar maps in other 
wikipedia languages, including Egyptian Arabic, Swahili and French. Fascinating 
stuff.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>E-prescriptions soar in N.H., although we're so-so compared to other states
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A company called Surescripts, which handles electronic prescriptions, has 
issued a report about the industry that, among other things, ranks the states. 
(Ranking states, people have found, is a great way to get coverage - like this.)
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Hampshire is No. 16 overall, and the number of physicians &quot;routing 
prescriptions&quot; quadrupled between 2008 and 2010. Another measure, 
&quot;Prescription Benefit Requests&quot; increased 10-fold over that period in 
the state. Massachusetts uses e-prescriptions more than any state, and 
Connecticut is No. 3.&nbsp; Maine (No. 13) and Vermont (No. 14) are slightly 
ahead of New Hampshire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nationwide, Surescripts says &quot;over 52 percent of office-based doctors 
now use e-prescribing&quot; - an announcement it made initially via Twitter, 
which is either really cool or really lame, I can't decide which.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are certainly issues about electronic medical records, but to me 
electronic prescriptions, as compared to scribbles on sheets ripped off pads of 
paper, seems a no-brainer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can see N.H. state results here; you can look through all the states, 
and the overall analysis,here.</p>

<p>Extreme surgical mask wins high-tech product of year award</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Foss Manufacturing's surgical mask has won top honors as the New Hampshire 
High Technology Council's 2011 Product of the Year. Foss, a Hampton-based 
company that produces engineered, non-woven fabrics and specialty 
syntheticfibers, won the 2011 POY award for the SpectraShield 9500 N95 Surgical 
Respirator Mask. The mask, which featuresFosshield embedded antimicrobial 
technology, eliminates 99.99% of bacteria on the treated surface within one 
hour and certain strains of harmful bacteria on contact before they can enter 
the body.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The company says the mask uses silver and copper ions, &quot;which are 
incorporated into the fiber and naturally attack the microbes. The&nbsp; ions 
bind to any microbes that may be present on the fiber and disable their 
critical functions (metabolism, respiration, and reproduction).&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the 6th annual NHHTC event held Monday, a large audience that included 
Gov. John Lynch saw five companies competing for the POY award with Judges 
Awards.&nbsp; Those five finalists were selected by the judges from a larger 
pool of candidates in October.&nbsp; The five displayed their products during a 
reception before the evening event, and then made seven-minute pitches as part 
of their effort to encourage the audience to vote for their product.&nbsp; The 
popular vote and previous judging by a panel of business and technology experts 
were equally weighed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The four other 2011 finalists were iGlobe of Franklin, which makes display 
equipment; Integra of Hudson (whose high-tech pipettesI profiled recently); 
Russound of Newmarket, which makes multiroom audio equipment; and Scribe 
Software of Manchester, which makes customer-relationship management software.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The NHHTC Product of the Year crystal trophy, which was designed by Pepi 
Hermann. The Foss Manufacturing name will be added to the trophy, and the 
trophy and an exhibit of the product will be on display and the 
Manchester-Boston Regional Airport for one year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Companies that have won the Product of the Year award over the past five 
years were Nanocomp Technologies, UltraVision, Insight Tech Gear, Holase, 
Incorporated, and Sky-Skan. Major event sponsors include Dyn,Inc, FairPoint, 
Cook, Little, Rosenblatt &amp; Manson PLLC, Hanover Insurance Group, Sadler 
Insurance Agency, New England Investment and Retirement, and BAE Systems. For

<p>Study: RGGI saved customers money, created jobs, cost power operators</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A study of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative performed by a 
Boston-based consulting firm with the boring name Analysis Group concludes that 
it was a winner, although that's partly because the recession dropped energy 
prices. From the executive summary:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* The regional economy gains more than $1.6 billion in economic value added 
(reflecting the difference between total revenues in the overall economy, less 
the cost to produce goods and services)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* Customers save nearly $1.1 billion on electricity bills, and an 
additional $174 million on natural gas and heating oil bills, for a total of 
$1.3 billion in savings over the next decade through installation of energy 
efficiency measures using funding from RGGI auction proceeds to date</p> 
<p>* 16,000 jobs are created region wide</p> 
<p>* Reduced demand for fossil fuels keeps more than $765 million in the local 
economy</p> 
<p>* Power plant owners experience $1.6 billion in lower revenue over time, 
although they overall had higher revenues than costs as a result of RGGI during 
the 2009-2011 period</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>RGGI has a lot of critics - New Hampshire almost withdrew and New Jersey is 
likely to - becaue it seems to add on costs in return for vague, tree-hugging 
rewards. This study, funded by several non-profits, seems to belie that.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can read the whole report here. The NY Times' Green Blog has an item 
about it here (I assume you need a subscription to read it).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A deer tick. Hard to see, hard to kill - even hard to knock off yourself 
into a jar of alcohol. (deertickbite.org)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's still tick season, partly because they generate natural antifreeze</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While working in the yard Sunday (I still haven't cleaned up all the downed 
limbs from the Halloween snowstorm, because my $#%@ chainsaw broke) I picked 
four ticks (yes, 4!) off myself. They were all tiny, barely visible, so they 
were either deer ticks, the kind that are most likely to carry Lyme disease, or 
immature variations of other species.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The immature ones have six legs rather than the adults' eight, but these 
were too tiny for me to tell. I just dropped them all into the car of alcohol 
on our kitchen counter for this purpose, because it's so hard to kill ticks 
otherwise. It has dozens of the dead little nasties floating in it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(UPDATE: After writing this post, I found another tick crawling on my&nbsp; 
arm on the drive to work. I had stopped at the compost pile on the way to the 
car - the darn thing must have jumped on me then. I threw it out the window; 
hopefully it was die on the highway and not make it to the median.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The discovery reinforces the fact that a short stretch of cold weather, 
even two feet of snow as we had, doesn't kill off ticks. They're hardy little 
so-and-sos, partly because they generate a natural antifreeze, usually glycol.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Natural antifreeze! You have to admire Mother Nature sometimes. Either 
that, or curse her.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My wife, the veterinarian, recommends that people with outdoor pets use 
tick prevention all year long; most clients assume she's just trying to get 
more money out of them, but it's a legitimate problem particularly as our 
winters warm up. Up north, extended warm weather and increased tick population 
is a problem for moose, which can carry so many of the parasites that they 
become anemic and weak, asthis Fish and Wildlife article notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Science Cafe talk about polling leaves me more dubious about polls</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two hours of great, intelligent discussion last night at Science Cafe about 
the science of polling (although the turnout wasn't so hot - we need to figure 
out a better way to spread the word).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The point I found most interesting came from panelist David Moore, who 
cofounded UNH's Survey Center and worked for Gallup among other things. He 
agreed with one questioner that polls are biased, but not in the way we think. 
They're not biased in favor of one point of view or one candidate - 
&quot;they're biased in favor of people having an opinion.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In other words, almost all polls do not give enough credence to the fact 
that most people have no opinion about the matter in question, whether it's 
presidential candidates or policy or whatever. If you waffle they ask whether 
you're &quot;leaning toward&quot; one side/candidate or the other, and tally 
the resulting &quot;Oh, I guess it's X if I have to say something&quot; as if 
it really represents an opinion. That's why the current GOP polling is swinging 
all over the place; many of the counts of support aren't real in the first 
place. Not until 48 hours before a national election are these polls truly 
accurate, he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Why do pollsters do this? Because a poll that announces &quot;most people 
don't have an opinion&quot; is boring and nobody would pay attention to it - or 
pay money to see it. The public says it doesn't like &quot;horse race&quot; 
coverage of politics, but we really do. We *like* so-and-so is improving but 
so-and-so- is fading coverage. It's like sports and doesn't require us to think 
too much. Whether it helps a functioning democracy is another question.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Kevin Landrigan, the Telegraph's statehouse reporter, said the polls that 
campaigns really care about ask indirect questions - e.g., &quot;Is the country 
headed in the right direction?&quot; - that they extrapolate for future 
support. &quot;If the election were held tomorrow, who would you vote 
for?&quot; polls, which are the bulk of primary polls at the moment, are 
largely ignored by the pros, he said.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My only dissapointment about the night is we didn't discuss the mathematics 
of determining margin of error. Too much beer, I guess.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Antivax didn't seem to play a role in whooping cough outbreak</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I heard of a pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak in Merrimack schools, 
my first thought was &quot;were unvaccinated kids the cause?&quot; because 
antivaxers have led to some recent outbreaks of this once-prevalent disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So we asked around as part of coverage, and it appears vaccine avoidance 
wasn't part of the problem - although 2 of the 14 kids did not get the DPT 
(diptheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine for religious reasons. (N.H. allows 
public school vaccine opt-out only for religious or strict medical reasons, not 
for the vague &quot;parents are worried because they saw something on the 
Internet&quot; option available in some states.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The N.H. Health and Human Services folks, who are very pro-vaccination 
because they actually know what they're talking about, say vaccine avoidance 
doesn't appear to be a cause of this outbreak.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Skipping vaccines has gotten so bad in parts of the country that some 
doctors won't see those family's kids, out of fear their parents' ignorance 
will spread harm to other patients, asthis USA Today story notes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New radar can tell the difference between rain and sleet</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass., which covers much of 
southern New Hampshire, will be getting access to an updated Doppler radar that 
&quot;will provide meteorologists with a three-dimensional image of water 
particles by sending and receiving pulses of radio waves in both a horizontal 
and vertical direction,&quot; says the Globe.&nbsp; Among other things, they'll 
be able to tell the difference between rain and sleet, which can make all the 
difference in winter weather.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a quick item from Boston.com's Metro Desk, a sort of blog for 
stories-in-the-making:read it here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A little Googling found a NOAA training seminar for use of what's called 
dual-polarization radar, which is being rolled out around the country. It 
includes training for non-meteorologists &quot;who rely on &hellip; data to 
make weather-related decisions.&quot;Here it is.</p>

<p>Nov. 18: Discovery Center hosts a UFO believer</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the Discovery Center in Concord. Super Stellar Friday: 
&quot;Interstellar Travel&quot; @ 7 PM</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Physicist and self-described UFO researcher Stanton T. Freidman, who 
believes in the Betty and Barney Hill abduction story among other things, will 
present an illustrated talk at the Discovery Center. Not their usual sort of 
fare (thankfully).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He'll argue that journeys to nearby stars are feasible with round trip 
times that are shorter than a person's life span - presumably via time 
distortion, which is sort of cheating (it's only shorter than the riders' life 
spans, not the stay-at-homes').&nbsp; Friedman thinks it's possible to get to 
the nearby base stars of the famed Betty Hill &quot;star map&quot; (which Berry 
drew from memory long after the abduction). You can view the original star map 
along with other artifacts from the Betty and Barney Hill Incident, the first 
nationally popularized UFO abduction story, which took place50 years ago in the 
White Mountains.</p>

<p>Could be fun, if not exactly science.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the designs available for LED light bulbs is called &quot;corn&quot; 
for obvious reasons</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The light bulbs, they are a-changin'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was in our local hardware store yesterday (County Stores in Milford, 
whose owner used to humilate me on the basketball court when our town had a 
casual over-30 league, not that I hold it against him) and found myself in the 
light bulb aisle. Then it hit me: I hadn't been down that aisle in ages!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It used to be that every time we went to the store (which is pretty often, 
because what's more fun than visiting a hardware store?) I automatically bought 
some bulbs, since we always needed to replace them. Now that our bulbs are 
virtually all compact fluorescents, though, I never need to replace any.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's an obvious thought - longer lifespan might be CFLs biggest selling 
point, wince electricity savings really doesn't add up to much money for the 
average homeowner. But it had never really hit me like that before.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The U.S. is about to enter the long, slow, and way overdue phase-out of 
incandescents:A survey by Osram Sylvania says most people are finally realizing 
that the change is coming, with new efficiency standards starting next year for 
100-watt light bulbs that will doom the traditional glowing-hot-wire bulb. The 
weird spasm of opposition to the change, advocating 19th-century technology as 
a good idea for 21st-century America, seems to have faded, thankfully.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm really looking forward to prices coming down and technology improving 
for good, 360-degree, warm light LED bulbs. CFLs are really a transition 
technology.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let the indoor lightlight revolution continue!</p>

<p>We got one of these 5x5x5 cubes a Christmas or two ago. It's basically the 
same as 3x3x3, except more so - whereas the 4x4x4 requires a different approach.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rubik's Cube Team Competition at Museum of Science</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you're a Rubik's Cube fan in the original sense of the word 
(&quot;fanatic&quot;) you might want to go to the Boston Mseum of Science on 
Saturday morning to watch eight-person teams from schools around New England 
compete to solve 25 cubes. Winners get prizes and the inevitable T-shirts, plus 
money for science education at their schools. It's from 10 am. to noon; more 
information at&nbsp;www.YouCanDoTheCube.com. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a warm-up, you can troll YouTube for the many videos there of 
4-year-olds solving the cube in a minute or two - I've seen at least one kid 
sitting in a high chair, doing it. Or you can watch &quot;CubeStormer&quot;, a 
machine made of (what else?) Legos that solves Rubik's Cubes using the Legos 
Mindstorms computer platform:It's here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(Confession: I've never been able to solve the cube. I can't even solve the 
2&times;2x2 version.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hey hunters - how many nanometers is the wavelength of your clothing color?
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm doing a story about blaze orange clothing for hunters, and came across 
a delightful tidbit. Most states (although not New Hampshire or Vermont) 
require it be worn by deer hunters* and often specify how many square inches 
must be visible above the waist. But Arkansas goes one better: It specifics 
that the clothing must have a &quot;predominant light wavelength of 595-605 
nanometers&quot; inlaw No. 115-4-4.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>*Deer don't exactly see in black-and-white, but they can't distringuish 
among green, red, yellow and orange; it all looks like gray to them. Turkeys 
and waterfowl, on the other hand, can see blaze orange just fine, which is why 
it's less common among those hunters.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More storms, worse air coming to the Seacoast, courtesy of climate change
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The likelihood of more frequent and severe weather events, increased 
asthma, and the death of crucial plant life in Great Bay are all realities on 
the Seacoast. &hellip; Their talks were framed, many said, by the recent draft 
document by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change that links man-made 
climate change to the extreme weather conditions in much of the world in recent

<p>That's from a Portsmouth Herald story about yesterday's climate change 
conference in that city (story here). It's a quickie story but a dose of 
depressing reality nonetheless.</p>

<p>Maine's smart meters' signal may interfere with other wireless home devices
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I'm a fan of the &quot;smart meter&quot; program being installed by Maine 
Central Power Co., as well as other utilities including New Hampshire 
Electrical Cooperative, but that doesn't mean it's perfect.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In fact, as the Portland Press-Herald reports: &quot;The office put out a 
statement this week saying Central Maine Power Co.'s smart meters - which use 
low-power radio frequency transmissions to send meter readings to the company - 
are interfering with a wide range of household electronic devices, from garage 
door openers and WiFi devices to security systems.&quot;Read the whole story 
here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Interference is always an issue, and the more things become wireless, the 
more possible conflicts we have.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's my earlier column about the program.</p>

<p>'Crowd-funding' research: Intriguing, if not a replacement for NSF grants
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My column in the Telegraph today (read it here) talks about attempts to 
'crowd-fund' real research, sort of likeKiva tries to crowd-fund small 
development projects in the Third World. The idea is to use the online world to 
le researchers ask lots of people to contribute a little bit each.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The column looks at SciFund Challenge, a short-term experiment on the 
RocketHub platform, which has been crowd-funding arts projects for a while. The 
projects are all pretty small by science standards, just a few thousands bucks 
each, usually covering a small part of overall research. The bulk of the 49 
proposals are wildlife/ecology projects, which partly a reflection of the 
fields in which SciFund's co-founders work, and partly a reflection of the fact 
that it's easier to raise public money to save coral reefs than to, say, 
categorize group theory.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I put a little money where my media mouth is: I gave $50 to a propsal to 
study whether &quot;critter cams&quot; in the wild, which use infrared beams or 
other technology to automatically photograph animals and thus get a better 
sense of what's happening when humans aren't around, might be unwittingly 
changing the behavior they mean to study. That's an interesting question I'd 
never thought of - but of course, finding interesting questions is what science 
does best.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The joy of a fetid, steaming pile of rotting glop</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I am fortunate to have enough room on my property for compost piles. For 
years I've had one for food scraps and one for leaves - I separated them so the 
kids and I could play in the leaf pile. They were the lowest of 
low-maintenance: I threw stuff on them for a couple of years, then started a 
new pile and let the old pile rot for a couple more years. No turning, or 
mixing of carbon and nitrogen sources, or any other effort. It did the job, if 
slowly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This year, as I have reported, my trees (like many others) were infected 
with a fungus that spoiled autumn color change. As I result, I'm trying to make 
a better leaf pile this year, one in which the interior heats up enough to kill 
the fungus, so I minimize its spread later on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have been mixing goat manure in with it (there's no leaf-jumping any 
more; the kids are in college), and turning it and watering it occasionally 
(which is a real pain in the neck) to encourage the growth of microbes that 
generate waste heat as they munch on organic stuff. Yesterday I was delighted 
to open up the pile and see steam rise into the cool air. I haven't gotten to 
the point of measuring the temperature, as serious compost-pile folks, like 
those who run commercial operations or the huge piles at the landfill (those 
guys sometimes have to lower the temperature in their piles so it won't kill 
the microbes), but it was still pretty neat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's something appealing about decay and rot - that's why people visit 
ruins, among other things. Seeing it happen in such a dramatic form, like a 
tiny little geothermal plant, is fun.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No news is very good news when you're hunting invasive bugs</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maine Forest Service had a good news release today: Their many 
invasive-bug-funding traps ended the season empty. Of course, lack of proof is 
not proof of a lack, but when it comes to invasives we'll take what we can get.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is from a press release:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Out of the 2,600 trap samples the MFS staff processed this past year, 
&quot;we got a lot of zeros&quot; for such dangerous insects as Asian 
longhorned beetle (ALB) and emerald ash borer (EAB), according to Charlene 
Donahue, MFS forest entomologist. This year, MFS staff put out 82 traps using 
pheromones (scents of the targeted insects) or kairomones (scents of insect 
food) throughout the state.&nbsp; The traps were out from April through 
October, and staffer collected samples from each trap two to 12 times during 
the year depending on the type of trap and the life cycle of the targeted 
insects. They targeted 16 high risk invasive insects, including ALB, EAB, brown 
spruce longhorned beetle, and various other serious pests that are not yet 
known to be in Maine</p>

<p>Verizon Wireless LTE coming to southern N.H.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Verizon Wireless said Monday that its 4G network, which they call Long Term 
Evolution (LTE), will come to Nashua, Manchester and other parts of southern 
New Hampshire next month.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The New Hampshire rollout, an extension up from eastern Massachusetts, is 
slated for Dec. 15. As well as Nashua, Manchester and the Manchester airport, 
coverage will be found in other parts of the Merrimack River valley (Bedford, 
Goffstown, Hudson, Litchfield, Merrimack, Pelham) -&nbsp; plus Loudon, 
presumably because they can sell a lot of minutes to people visitingthe 
racetrack.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The rollout is part of an expansion into a bunch of places, including more 
of northeastern Massachusetts</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Verizon Wireless' 4G LTE network launched a year ago, and claims average 
data rates of 5 to 12 megabits per second (Mbps) on the downlink and 2 to 5 
Mbps on the uplink.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The network operates on the 700 MHz spectrum, access to which Verizon 
Wireless bought from the feds after it was freed by switching TV broadcasters 
from analog to digital.</p>

<p>Penguin pulls its e-books from library lending program</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I got a notice from my library last night that Penguin books has pulled out 
of a program that lets you download e-books and some audio books through your 
public library account. Penguin cited &quot;security concerns&quot; - 
presumably fear that it would fuel sales of e-book readers from Amazon, which 
is becoming a sort of publishing house and thus competing with Penguin. Or 
something like that.Here's a story from Publisher's Weekly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The library program uses a company called OverDrive. A lot of libraries in 
New Hampshire use it,as this site notes. I wrote about the program back in 
March of 2010, when e-books started joining audiobooks, but the system has 
grown a lot since then.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Penguin was my favorite publisher for a long time. Those orange-spined 
paperbacks look so cool, and I was quite the literary Anglophile, which sent me 
to the British publishing house. I love the copies found at used bookstores 
that have prices on them in shillings and pounds &hellip; no e-book will ever 
have that sort of nostalgic aura.</p>

<p>Ham radios are spreading like crazy. What's next: Crystal radio sets?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I wrote a couple of stories after the Halloween Snowstorm talking about the 
relative fragility of phone connections over Internet and/or cable modem (they 
go down and stay down when the power's out; old-fashioned landline phones 
usually stay up), and ended one with a semi-joking comment about how ham radio 
always works. Noting that the state's Emergency Operations Center has two 
stations for ham radios, I said &quot;The spread of new communication 
technologies is helping an old technology hang on.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I didn't really mean it, but maybe I should have: The number of amateur 
radio licenses in the U.S. is soaring and now top 700,000, an all-time high, 
according to the American Radio Relay League (read it here).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Quebec has an official &quot;dark sky&quot; site - why can't we?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New hobbies are more fun is they require new toys, so I'm delighted to see 
that in order to participate in a global crowd-sourcing project measuring light 
pollution, you have to buy a specialized photometer called aSky Quality Meter. 
Now you don't have to just complain about lights washing out the stars, you can 
measure the problem in apparent magnitude per square arcsecond. Cool! (The 
meter costs $120, plus shipping.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The project is called MyDarkSky, which is trying to create a real-time 
global map that would let you find the closest dark-sky area for some stellar 
viewing. Here's the map - it's a British site so that's where most of the data 
is.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The closest pins are in Quebec, which has the Mount Megantic Dark Sky 
Preserve - designated as such by the International Dark Sky Association. I've 
always thought that Coos County should push for a similar designation as a 
tourist draw.</p>

<p>Sheet music on a tablet - an idea that really makes sense</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have poked at pianos for much of my life (the verb &quot;played&quot; 
hardly fits, since I still fumble through music designed for the third-year 
students - but I enjoy it, even if nobody else within listening distance does), 
and for years I have awaited the arrival of digital music scores. Trying to 
turn pages in sheet music, having them fall off the piano or get stuck, is so 
annoying that I can't believe the computer world hasn't replaced it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Turns out, they have, and the arrival of tablet PCs/iPads may finally bring 
it to the masses. The NY Times has a story today about a conducting leading the 
New York Philharmonic using an iPad. (Read it here, if you can.) The Times has 
finally embraced external links in its stories, so it led me to the I
nternational Music Score LIbrary Project, a wiki-based project that uploads 
PDFs of classical music, presumably because they includes scores that are old 
enough to avoid copyright issues. Cool!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That, in turn, led me to poke around and find out that I'm way behind in 
this area. There are plenty of places where you can buy sheet music online in 
PDF form to download and print out or display on tablet PCs/iPads, including 
some variations like &quot;big note&quot; music - the equivalent of large print 
books for us weak-eyed older folks. There are also interactive projects, like 
BACH (BinAural Cooperative Hypertext), software that uses Shockwave to 
integrates musical scores with audio and commentary on the Web. And there's a 
whole industry of software and hardware &quot;tablet sheet music&quot; programs 
of various costs and complexity that take sheet music PDFs and let you annotate 
them, or turn pages by foot pedal (!) or automatically on a timer, and even 
integrate with MIDI file so you can hear the music to help you learn it. There 
are even wireless interactive sets so that, say, a high school band director 
can make changes to sheet music and have it show up automatically for everybody 
in class.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Alas, there doesn't seem to be a program that will make it easy for me to 
learn &quot;Take the A Train.&quot; Some things computers can't do.</p>

<p>A thought: Replace &quot;Black Friday&quot; with &quot;Make Something 
Day&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Maker community - that cheerfully pushy mix of do-it-yourselfers, 
hackers, and lovers of dangerous tools - has a suggestion: Instead of rushing 
out to buy something on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving, when 
retailers traditionally entered the black financially for the year), why not 
try to make something?Like this:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Anti-consumerism supporters&quot; have been pushing for years for 
Black Friday to become &quot;Buy Nothing Day&quot;. Are you saying I can even 
buy a cup of coffee? &hellip; The key to this movement, organized in Canada 
back in September 1992, is to&nbsp;counteract over-consumption.&nbsp; Let's get 
to the root of what the holiday's were all about. &hellip; What could be more 
loving then creating something from the heart, and sharing it with those around 
you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully promote &quot;MAKE SOMETHING FRIDAY&quot; to 
indulge&nbsp;the Craftcraver in all of us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Make Something Friday isn't an anti-capitalist, back-to-Nature screed that 
could bring the economy crashing down. Most Makers buy stuff as part of their 
efforts - it's just that they buy tools, materials, manuals, and the like 
instead of things made by somebody else using tools and materials in, say, 
China.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I must confess that I'm a Maker admirer but not participant; the few things 
I've ever built (shelving in the unfinished basement) were ugly hack jobs that 
barely served their purpose, due to combination of impatience and clumsiness. 
My wife is the tool-wielding primate in this house; she bult the bookshelves 
upstairs, for example. But it's never too late to change.</p>

<p>Hey, kids: Let's make a science fiction movie for the oldest genre film 
festival!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 2012 Boston Science Fiction Film Festival is accepting entries, which 
can be submitted through something calledWithoutabox, an indie-film-oriented 
division of IMDB that makes it easy to distribute and publicize movies. The 
festival calls itself the longest-running &quot;genre film festival&quot; (this 
will be year 37) and who am I to argue? It runs for 10 days and, if I may quote
the Web site:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Festival ends with The 'Thon, a non-stop 24 hour orgiastic film event. 
Think of it like the biggest sleepover you'll ever go to enjoying classic, 
premiere or schlocky sci-fi films. It is an amazing event. How else could it 
have survived for 37 years?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There you go. Time to pull out the Super-8 camera and make that home movie 
you've always dreamed of; submissions are due by Jan. 10.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I want to make the movie about how Twinkies are actually larval form of 
creatures from Episoln VII which have to pupate for 82 years before the creamy 
filling turns into a Godzilla-like demonic beast &hellip; and since Twinkies 
were &quot;invented&quot; (that's what They want us to think) in 1930, this is 
the year that a sample from the first batch will Come To Life!!!!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What, they don't accept Super-8 movies at Withoutabox?</p>

<p>Australia may remove benefits from parents who don't immunize their kids</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Austrlia, which has seen a particularly successful burst of anti-vaccine 
advocates, is considering a plan under which parents who do not have their 
children fully immunized will lose family tax benefits, which can reach 
Aus$2,100 (about $2,050) per kid.Read the article from ABC (Australian 
Broadcasting Co.)Good for them: Avoiding vaccination puts a cost on society, 
and people should face up to costs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A whopping 11 percent of Australian children are not immunized. Holy cow. 
The figure in New Hampshire is just a couple of percent, which includes medical 
and religious exemption.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Attempts were made in NH last year to let parents opt out if they have 
&quot;philosophical objections,&quot; but it was defeated on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. New Hampshire pays for all vaccinations for all state 
residents younger than 19. The program deals with about 320,000 people a year, 
at a cost of about $25 million.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you Google &quot;Australian anti-vaccination&quot; you'll find a group 
with the misleading titled Australian Vaccination Network, which peddles the 
&quot;right to choose&quot; mantra as a thin cover of the usual 
pseudo-science/political antivax hysteria.</p>

<p>&quot;Fixing&quot; rivers altered by Irene isn't as easy as it sounds</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Burlington Free-Press has a big look today at a contentious issue: What 
to do with rivers that were changed when Tropical Storm Irene bullied through 
Vermont. &quot;Righting a river is not as simple as it sounds.&quot; it notes. (
The whole article is here) A snippet:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Most people come into the conversation sure they know what's right, he 
said. Many argue that after a 1973 flood, the river was dredged and 
straightened, and it should be this time, too. &quot;River science has come a 
long way in the last 30 years,&quot; (an engineer) said. Clearing out gravel 
and re-shifting a river's flow cost money and cause more problems, he said. 
&quot;When you dig down too deep, the water can't get out onto the flood 
plain,&quot;&nbsp; which is where rivers are supposed to go when they flood. 
Clearing out a river bed also removes natural material such as tree branches 
and rocks that slow a river's flow. Instead, the river will run faster, 
creating problems downstream.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I like this quote a lot, regarding East Creek:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;At some point, it's going to get to the far side of the valley and 
then it's going to move back. If you stood in that location for 1,000 years, it 
would keep moving back and forth. If you live next to the river, you say, 'Oh 
my God.'&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The main lesson, of course, is that if you build in floodplains, you'll 
have problems. All of us have built a lot of stuff in a lot of floodplains, 
with the expectation that the situation will never change for the worse.</p>

<p>Do hidden cameras alter the wildlife behavior they're trying to study?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hidden cameras in the woods, triggered by motion detectors of various 
types, have become a major tool in conservation studies, allowing us to take 
pictures, or make informal census counts, of animals at all times and in secret 
places. (They are also popular with hunters, who use them to figure out game 
patterns before hunting season starts.) But a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford 
University is raising an interesting question about them: What if they change 
the behavior we're tring to study?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You may wonder how I know this of a West Coast guy. It's because his 
project is one of 49 asking for crowd-funding help at SciFund. I wrote about it 
recentlyin my column, but figured I'd give it another prod here, because the 
deadline is in a few weeks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I gave him $50, because I thought the idea is cool, but he needs another 
$1,372. You can see his pitch here:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(Some readers say that link is bad, but it works for me. Try this if you 
have problems:http://www.rockethub.com/projects/by_category/34-science)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's some of his writeup:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Camera trapping, an especially promising non-invasive technology, uses 
remotely activated cameras that have motion detectors to take photos when an 
animal walks by. &hellip; The resulting images are a huge boon to scientists 
who want to understand wildlife; they help illuminate which species are in an 
area, how many of them there might be, what they are eating/hunting and other 
behaviors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Despite their amazing usefulness, there has been next to no research 
regarding the response of wildlife to the technology itself (which often 
assumed to be negligible or non-existent)!&nbsp; In a previous study, using an 
older generation of camera trapping systems, I found that deer significantly 
change their behavior when the camera traps were present.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I am conducting this project to identify if mammals can see the newest 
generation of covert camera traps (with &quot;invisible&quot; infrared flash 
and digital recording technology).&nbsp; I have preliminary evidence suggesting 
that even these covert cameras ultimately affect the behavior of some wildlife 
species, but this question deserves further study.&nbsp; If there are 
unidentified effects, they are likely affecting the data that is being 
collected and, as an end result, could affect conservation practices and 
wildlife management.</p>

<p>We found a tick crawling on a laptop! (Cue &quot;bug&quot; jokes)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Telegraph column today (read it here) is about the spread of ticks in 
the region, spurred in warming winters and land-use changes - it's an expansion 
of a GraniteGeek post from a week or two ago.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As if on cue, last night my wife found a tick crawling on her laptop 
computer! Man, they really *are* everywhere this year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can make all the bug jokes you want, but as an eight-legged arachnid, 
ticks aren't bugs by the strict definition.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Flying squirrels in New Hampshire - who knew?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Did you know that a species of flying squirrel exists in the Northeast? I 
didn't until a reader, Dave Bushee, wrote me wondering about a weird sighting 
in his yard:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There were around 30 or 40 what appears to be GREY Chipmunks all around the 
area of the feeder. It was around 7:00 PM so it was pretty dark. As soon as the 
light hit them they scattered, mostly climbing up the trees, not going to 
ground like a normal chipmunk would do. They do come right back looking for 
more food as soon as the light goes off them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I said they must be red squirrels, and he said no, he knew what those look 
like, so I said they must be mutant rodents irradiated by Vermont Yankee 
emissions -hahahahahahaha! - and so he wisely gave up on me. Instead he went 
and found out what they were:Northern Flying Squirrels a.k.a. Glaucomys 
sabrinus.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of e-books, in libraries and in bookstores</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Earlier this month Penguin books pulled out of the e-book lending program 
used by 180 of New Hampshire's public libraries (and thousands around the 
country), largely because it was pissed at Amazon for trying to use the program 
to boost sales of the Kindle at a time when Amazon is signing up authors and 
becoming a direct competitor to publishers like Penguin. They have returned 
their books, for now,as I report in today's Telegraph.*</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But they're not the only ones mad at Amazon. The three-store Toadstool 
Bookshops, a very fine local independent bookstore, has signs on its counters 
asking people not to buy Kindles because that locks them into Amazon and locks 
out bookstores. (I'm reporting on that story today.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Although the advance of e-readers and tablets is cool technology, this 
fight is all about money and copyright and corporate control, at a time when a 
well-established industry is being tumbled around at lightning speed by 
unexpected change. We newspaper-folk sympathize.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* The story is sort of a correction. Our reporter wrote the &quot;Penguin 
has pulled out&quot; story last Tuesday but it didn't run until Sunday because 
of the need to fill papers over the news-thin, long holiday weekend, but 
Penguin had already returned their books by the time the story ran &hellip;</p>

<p>UNH scientists to help estimate effect of melting galciers on sea levels</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NASA photo: In southern China, just north of the border with Nepal, one 
unnamed Himalayan glacier flows from southwest to northeast, creeping down a 
valley to terminate in a glacial lake</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By David Sims, UNH News Service: Scientists at the University of New 
Hampshire'sInstitute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS) have been 
funded by NASA to improve estimates of how melting mountain glaciers around the 
globe will contribute to sea level rise in the future. The data, which 
are&nbsp; poorly understood, will be a critical new element in the next 
assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Our role in this project is to plug new meltwater estimates into the 
global water balance/river transport model we developed here at UNH and move it 
all downstream to gauge potential sea level rise,&quot; says co-investigator 
and lead UNH scientist Richard Lammers of the Water Systems Analysis Group. 
&quot;It's an accounting of the world's water under changing conditions.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The multi-institution project also involves scientists from the University 
of Alaska, Fairbanks and Ohio State University who will, respectively, run 
glacier mass balance models to determine how all this ice will change under 
different climate scenarios, and improve estimates of all the global mountain 
glaciers by means of &quot;remotely sensed&quot; satellite maps.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For decades, the massive ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have been 
the subject of intense scientific investigation to assess their potential 
contribution to sea level rise, but a full assessment and study of the smaller 
and scattered population of mountain glaciers around the globe has not been 
factored into climate models. This is due in part to a scarcity of data; while 
some 131,000 mountain glaciers have been cataloged, twice that number are 
thought to exist worldwide. Says Lammers, &quot;While there are large parts of 
the world where small glaciers have been identified and mapped, such as the 
Himalayas, in other regions they are neither well mapped nor sufficiently 
investigated with respect to what a warming climate will do to them.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The hydrological resource implications of continuing glacial melt will 
affect more than 1.1 billion people living in glacier or snowmelt-fed river 
basins around the globe. Moreover, glacial meltwater often provides the only 
source of water for humans and biodiversity during dry seasons. Increased melt 
due to climate change has the potential to substantially alter both the 
magnitude and timing of freshwater discharge.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The three-year study will estimate and predict the contribution of mountain 
glaciers to sea level for the last decade and out to the end of this century. 
The interdisciplinary work combines glaciology, meteorology, hydrology, 
satellite remote sensing, and sea-level research.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An important aspect of UNH's water balance/river transport modeling will be 
taking into account meltwater that does not make its way downstream to oceans 
due to human intervention such as dams, irrigation, or because the rivers flow 
into landlocked or &quot;endorheic&quot; drainage basins.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We will establish which glaciers are providing water to the oceans 
and which are sending it to these endorheic basins,&quot; Lammers says. 
Moreover, he adds, because irrigation is a huge factor in the overall equation, 
even if melting glaciers and icecaps are adding in meltwater that heretofore 
has not been part of the global hydrological cycle, the vast amounts of water 
removed for irrigation purposes will not directly contribute to overall sea 
level rise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;So human effects may mitigate somewhat the affects of the excess melt 
and eventual sea level rise, and getting a better understanding of all that is 
part of our work with the water balance/transport model,&quot; Lammers notes.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The principal investigator for the project is Regine Hock of the University 
of Alaska, Fairbanks. Hock will use climate projections such as temperatures 
and precipitation amounts from IPCC data in glacier mass balance models on all 
of the individual mountain glaciers identified for the study. Co-investigator 
Jason Box of Ohio State University will develop and refine global-scale land 
ice inventories using satellite remote sensing imagery from a variety of NASA 
Earth-orbiting satellites.</p>

<p>Spotting Photoshopped picture via the magic of mathematics</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I first wrote about Hany Farid, a computer science professor at Dartmouth, 
and his mathematical calculations to expose manipulation of photographs, back 
in 2003. He's still at it, as the NY Times reports today; he has developed a 
1-to-5 scale to show how much Photoshopping has been done to a picture. (Times 
story here)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's a section from my 2003 Granite Geek article (the column was then 
called Science from the Sidelines):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Basically, what the research team does is compress a photo, then compare 
patterns in the resulting file to patterns from compressed files of tens of 
thousands of natural photos. The more dissimilar the patterns, the more likely 
that the test photo has been altered.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not that simple, of course. Farid isn't just shrinking photos, but is 
decomposing them into multiple images with different orientations and different 
scales using something called wavelet transforms.He then compares several 
statistical properties, which tend to be consistent across most natural images 
and hard to forge. If these properties are out of whack, suspicions are raised.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The easiest example to understand is airbrushing. &quot;Smoothing out&quot; 
pictures with airbrushing makes it easier to compress the picture because it 
blurs sharp edges. Sharp edges, with their high contrast between adjacent 
pixels, have lots of information that is hard to compress.So airbrushed 
pictures tend to have different statistics in compressed mode that 
non-airbrushed pictures. See those differences and a red flag goes up.</p>

<p>E-book battle, round umpty-ump: Independent bookstores vs. Amazon</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My latest e-book story is in today's Telegraph: Independent bookstores hope 
you don't use a Kindle, because then you can't buy e-books through them, you 
have to go through Amazon.com.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the story</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>UPDATE: One advantage of web publishing over old newspaper publishing is 
being able to respond immediately to reader feedback. The story now has a large 
note from me atop it, explaining (as the original story didn't) that the issue 
is DRM copyright-protection. The Kindle only uses Amazon's version, so it can't 
read DRM'ed books from other sellers. I explained this because a couple of 
readers wrote in to say they had downloaded free books (e.g., project 
Gutenberg) which worked fine.</p>
