<h3> Walt Disney 2009 Vacation </h3>  Thursday, April 30, 2009 
<p></p>We arrived in WDW yesterday! The drive down was uneventful. We stopped 
in NC overnight and reached Orlando by about 1pm.
<p>Despite the current H1N1 flu concern, things are calm and *normal* here. 
</p> 
<p>We had a bite to eat at Captain Cook's here at the Polynesian and then 
headed to the Magic Kingdom via monorail.</p> 
<p>We went on the Buzz Lightyear ride - Wyatt screamed through it. Dante, CJ, 
Fawn and Olivia went on the Tomorrowland Speedway - Livi sucks at driving! 
Fawn, Dante, Livi and I went on Goofy's Barnstormer - kids loved it. We all 
went on Pooh's Adventure - Wyatt screamed through it!</p> 
<p>CJ took Dante and Liv on the Merry Go Round. The park was empty, we got 
right on rides.</p> 
<p>Olivia and Dante met Ariel and all three kids met Buzz! We took the boat 
launch back to the Polynesian and got to see Wishes from the boat!</p> 
<p>Today is Animal Kingdom and dinner at Kona Cafe.<br>

<h3> Is the Disney Dining Plan Worth It? </h3>  Friday, April 24, 2009  Ahhh, 
Disney dining, it's a love/hate thing for most people, although I'd have to say 
more people love it than not and I know for my family, it's the one thing we 
really look forward to.<br>
<br>
Since my children are only 6, 3 and 2, 
character dining is a MUST. On a typical day we usually have 1-2 table service 
meals scheduled. That sounds like a lot but we LOVE going to breakfasts and 
finishing up with wonderful dinners. That being said, is it really beneficial 
for us to purchase the dining plan?<br>
<br>
The 2009 Dining Plan <br>
<br>

Last year we got the basic plan and to be honest, I think it was waste. Like I 
said, we prefer breakfasts. The kids are usually the best behaved at breakfast 
because it's the start of the day and breakfast food is pretty ordinary so even 
my pickiest eater loves it. With that being said, breakfast is usually the 
cheapest meal of the day so when we use the dining plan and schedule a lot of 
breakfasts, we aren'treally getting our money's worth. <br>
<br>
 Gratuity for 
the table service meals is not covered in the dining plan and neither are 
appetizers so if you want to order an appetizer, you pay for it out of pocket. 
What is included is a soft drink and dessert and this is great IF you don't 
want wine, beer or a mixed drink with your dinnerand you usually order dessert. 
<br> <br>
 If you have children under the age of 3 they can share a meal with 
someone or you can order them their own but again, you pay out of pocket for 
that meal. So, what happened with us last trip was that every meal we were 
still paying for something, a child's meal, an appetizer, a drink and/or the 
gratuity so it didn't really feel as though we were getting a deal.<br>
<br>
 
Also, the basic plan allows for a snack every day. Not all of us had a snack 
every day so by the end of our trip we had all sorts of credits left over for 
snacks. We of course cashed them in and had plenty of snacks for the trip home!
<br> <br>
 Now, you can use these meals as you want. If you want to use 3 quick 
service meals in one day, you can - it doesn't matter how you use them but make 
sure you use them! Some table service meals require 2 credits. Last year we 
attended The Spirit of Aloha luau (which was awesome by the way!) and that took 
up 2 table service credits. You can read about thatHere and Here <br>
<br>
 In 
the end, it really depends on you and who you're vacationing with. Even though 
I said never again, we did book this upcoming vacation to include the basic 
dining plan. I figure it deserves another chance before I definitely turn my 
nose up at it.<br>
<br>

breakdown (math wise) check out:Disney's Dining Plan (That's My Opinion) by

<h3> Disney's Online Resort Check-in </h3>  Tuesday, April 21, 2009 Guess what 
I just did? I just checked into the Polynesian Resort! No, we're not there yet 
but Disney allows resort guests to check in up to 10 days prior to their 
arrival date!<br>
<br>
We booked our vacation with AAA - my travel agent's name 
is Travis Flexer and he is wonderful. He told me I'd receive information in the 
mail regarding online check in and I did! Checking in online is simple. If you 
decide to check in online, you will need the following information:<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reservation Number</li> 
<li>Name</li> 
<li>Arrival and departure dates</li> 
<li>Your address and phone number</li> 
<li>A phone number you can be reached at while traveling</li> 
<li>Credit Card information, if you plan on having a credit card set up for 
extra room charges, such as internet usage, etc...</li> 
<li>Special requests, such as room refrigerator or pack n play, etc...</li> 
</ul>A welcome folder with your Key to the World Card will be waiting for you 
at the designated Online Check-in area at the resort. You will need to present 
photo ID to pick up the packet and complete your check-in. Simple!<br>
<br>
A 
few things you should know:<br>

<ul> 
<li>You will not be able to change your reservation via the Online Check-in 
Service.</li> 
<li>Utilizing Online Check-in will not get your room ready any faster than 
normal processes.</li> 
<li>Disneyland is currently not participating in this service.</li> </ul>This 
service began this year and so we haven't used it until now. I'll let you know 
how things go! I can say that the online part was easy! Share | <br>

<h3> Disney World in April and May </h3>  Monday, April 20, 2009  As I 
mentioned already, I prefer going to Disney World between the end of April - 
the middle of May - first and foremost, because of the weather. It is 
BEAUTIFUL! Highs are usually mid 80's and lows around mid 60's. From right 
after Easter to right before Memorial Day the crowds aren't bad at all.<br>
<br>
The other reason?Epcot's Flower and Garden Festival - it's so gorgeous in Epcot 
this time of year!<br>
<br>
Disney really knows how to beautify the 
surroundings! I can't wait to go back! Only 8 more days until we leave!<br>

<h2>Sunday, April 19, 2009</h2> 
<h3> Disney Vacations for 5 or More </h3>  Sunday, April 19, 2009  At this 
moment, we are a family of 5 - me, CJ, and the 3 kids ages 2, 3 and 6. In my 
experience, this is the maximum amount of people for most rooms at any of the 
Disney resorts. For example, we LOVE thePolynesian Resort - it's our favorite! 
<br>The rooms we get have 2 Queen size beds and the sofa opens up into a day 
bed, so that is perfect for 5. This year, even though 6 of us are going (my 
mother in law is going to be with us) we're still okay because my youngest is 
only 2 and can still sleep comfortably in a pack n play. Here is what the room 
looks like:<br>
<br>
If we decide to go next year, or any year after that for 
that matter, Wyatt will no longer be free and he will no longer be able to 
sleep in a pack n play. We can still stay at the Polynesian if Fawn (my MIL) 
doesn't come along - but of course, we love having her along. That being said, 
we have already begun looking into other options. Of course there are bigger 
rooms st the Polynesian, for $900+ a night which is definitely NOT in our 
budget! We could book 2 rooms at the Polynesian, but the 2 rooms would equal 
close to over $800 a night anyway, so that is out!<br>
<br>
Other options I 
have looked at so far:<br>
<br>
Disney Villas <br>
<br>
My first choice is the 
newBay Lake Tower Villas because, well, they are new and the are right by the 
monorail - I love being near Disney's monorail transportation! Most villas are 
for 4 or 5 people, the next one up is for a maximum of 9 people and that is a 2 
bedroom villa at $630/night! About $4,000 just for the room??? OUCH!<br>
<br>

My second choice would be Disney'sAnimal Kingdom Lodge Villas - Savana View of 
course. Again, most one bedroom villas are for 4-5 people maximum, then it 
jumps to a 2 bedroom villa for a maximum of 9 people. For a two-bedroom villa 
with a standard view of the savanna there is an additional adult charge of $25 
per adult per night for more than 2 adults - this villa is $700/night!<br>
<br>

So, onto the moderate resorts, looking at the suites. So far, the only one that 
appeals to me is Disney'sCoronado Springs Resort and a suite there, which 
allows a maximum of 6 people is $655 a night!<br>
<br>
My BFF and her family 
are staying there this May - I am interested in hearing how they like this 
resort.<br>
<br>
Finally, one last option is the family suites at Disney's All 
Star Music which is a value resort. <br>
<br>
The suites give you all of this 
for a maximum of 6 people:<br>

<ul> 
<li>Queen-size bed</li> 
<li>Double-size sleeper sofa</li> 
<li>2 twin-size sleeper chairs</li> 
<li>Living room</li> 
<li>2 bathrooms</li> 
<li>Mini-kitchen</li> 
<li>Vanity area with sink</li> 
<li>Table and chairs</li> 
<li>All rooms are non-smoking</li> 
<li>In-room wall safe</li> 
<li>Voice mail</li> 
<li>Internet access (additional fee) </li> 
<li>Microwave</li> 
<li>Iron and ironing board</li> 
<li>Hairdryer</li> 
<li>Pack 'n Play playard is available upon request</li> 
<li>Wheelchair-accessible rooms are available</li> 
<li>Views of the parking lot, courtyard or pool</li> </ul>The price? $184
/night! WOW - why so cheap? Well, first of all, the location. It's near Animal 
Kingdom and that's about it. You take a bus to get around. This means you need 
to plan for extra travel time. It's also a loud and crowded resort, of course - 
it's cheap. Regular rooms start at around $82/night. Lots of times groups such 
as school trips, cheeerleading camps, etc...stay there.<br>
Honestly, I'd stay 
there if I REALLY wanted to go to WDW and was on a very tight budget. The 
layout seems okay:<br>
<br>
More Pictures <br>
<br>
So, that's where I'm at 
with this. Staying off property in a rental house, while cost effective, is not 
something I'd want to do. Staying on site at a Disney resort is one of the main 
reasons I love to go to Disney! Share | <br>

<h3> Best Places to Watch Fireworks in Disney World </h3>  Friday, April 17, 
2009  On our last trip we didn't get to see fireworks while we were in a park. 
We were always back in our room by 8 pm or so and that sucked. We never got to 
see Illuminations, we never got to Hollywood Studios so we didn't see fireworks 
there and we didn't get to stay at the Magic Kingdom long enough to see Wishes.
<br> <br>
We did, however, get to watch Wishes from out resort, the Polynesian 
- right there on the beach - and that was fantastic!<br>
<br>
This year I want 
to be prepared, so I did a search to find the best places to watch the 
fireworks and here's what I found:<br>
<br>
Magic Kingdom<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> From the Dumbo ride....preferably on Dumbo</li> 
<li> Outside The Plaza restaurant</li> 
<li> In front of Splash Mountain, there's a opening you can see them clearly
</li> 
<li> Tomorrowland.... on the bridge...</li> 
<li> Walkway between the Central Hub in front of the Castle and Tomorrowland
</li> 
<li> The rose garden if you can get there</li> 
<li> On one of the benches by the riverboat on the Rivers of America<br>
</li> 
<li>Bridge from the central hub to Tomorrow Land<br>
</li> 
<li> From the gallows at Liberty Square<br>
</li> 
<li> On Main Street, but not at the hub; further up the street by the ice 
cream parlor. You are able to enjoy the 360 degree fireworks and get great 
photo and video shots! Try to stand where in the first row after the street 
path the cast members tape off that way people's heads aren't directly in front 
of you</li> 
<li> The Grand One Yacht on Bay Lake!</li> 
<li> From the monorail as it circles the Seven Seas Lagoon. Great views of the 
entire fireworks display</li> 
<li>The Beach at one of the Magic Kingdom resorts (Polynesian, Grand Floridan, 
Wilderness Lodge, Ft. Wilderness or Contemporary)!</li> </ul> <br>
Hollywood 
Studios <br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>From the courtyard in front of the Mickey's hat.</li> 
<li>From Hollywood Blvd. sitting at one of the umbrella tables.</li> 
<li>Standing right in front of the Crossroads.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
Epcot <br>

<br> <br>

<ul> 
<li>On the bridge by Mexico</li> 
<li>Near American Adventure</li> 
<li>From France<br>
</li> 
<li>In Germany<br>
</li> 
<li> In front of the Norway, good view, all facilities within easy reach 
(Kringla Bakeri, restrooms, water fountain)</li> 
<li> Near Japan. The view by the Tori Gate is great<br>
</li> 
<li>Between Norway and China there is a cast member entrance set back a ways 
from the walkway. You can step back into this area, get out of the way of the 
traffic and have a virtually unobstructed view of the lagoon and the sky</li> 
<li> Anywhere around the lagoon<br>
</li> 
<li> Anywhere around the World Showcase </li> </ul> (courtesy of allears.net) 
<br> <br>
This year we have a Wishes Cruise scheduled - I am so so excited for 
this! However, we are also going to try and seeIlluminations one night and I 
would really love to be in the Magic Kingdom to seeWishes at least once on this 
upcoming trip!<br>
<br>
I'm not sure we'll be seeing any fireworks at Hollywood 
Studios - that one is still up for discussion. Share | <br>

<h3> Disney's Dining Plan </h3>  Tuesday, April 14, 2009 Last trip, after all 
was said and done the one thing I said I wouldn't do again was the dining plan. 
However, probably due to laziness, when we booked this year's vacation I did 
include the dining plan.<br>
<br>
Here's a breakdown of the cost for the dining

<br>
Premium Dining Plan <br>
Adult:

Child: $109.00 <br>
<br>

a soft drink.</li> 
<li>Table Service Meal &ndash; a meal from a traditional restaurant or a 
buffet. This meal also includes entr&eacute;e, dessert and soft drink. Beware; 
certain restaurants require two table service credits for a single meal. An 
example would be the California Grill at the Contemporary.</li> 
<li>Snacks &ndash; may typically be purchased from counter service locations, 
kiosks or carts throughout Walt Disney World parks and resorts. Some examples 
of eligible snack options would include: a frozen ice-cream, a fruit bar, a bag 
of chips, a 20 oz. bottle of Coke or a 20 oz. bottle of water.</li> 
<li>Refillable Drink Mug &ndash;is available, for cash, from each Disney World 
resort. This year, the price is $12.49 and once purchased you can get free 
refills at identified soft drink locationsat your resort for the length of your 
stay.</li> </ul>Now, just what do you get with each plan? Here's a breakdown: 
<br> <br>

<h4>Quick Service Dining Plan</h4>

<h3> Teppan Edo in Epcot </h3>  Sunday, April 12, 2009  One meal we have 
planned is lunch atTeppan Edo the Japanese restaurant in the Japan Pavilion in 
Epcot. I have never eaten here but I thought it may be fun. The chefs cook at 
the table and entertain as they cook.<br>
<br>
I thought lunch would be a good 
time, so we have reservations at noon. I've read mixed reviews about this 
place. Many have said the food wasn't worth the price - but then again, I guess 
it's the entertainment you pay for.<br>

<h3> Tips for Packing for Your Disney Vacation! </h3>  Wednesday, April 8, 2009
 Many people travel by plane to get to Disney. We considered flying this trip 
but have decided to drive. However, when we thought we'd be flying I panicked! 
HOW was I going to pack everything I needed for 5 people?! Diapers, clothing, 
bathroom stuff, bathing suits, towels, etc..<br>
<br>
Here is what I was going 
to do and if you are flying and feel overwhelmed with packing, this may help:
<br> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Pool gear - only pack suits - forget beach towels. The resorts have a 
little shed by the pool that has towels in it. If yours doesn't, take a room 
towel. Beach towels take up too much room if you try to pack them!</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Send yourself a package - If you need to take diapers, formula, extra 
snacks, etc... box it up and send it UPS or FedEx! Plan for it to arrive the 
day before or the day of your arrival. The resort will receive your package and 
hold it for you. Yes, you will pay to ship the package but it's worth it to 
avoid the stress and hassle of taking all that stuff with you - don't forget 
about the luggage fees now too!</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Order Groceries - Don't want to ship stuff? Create an account online with 
Garden Grocer and place your order before you get to your resort. You can 
schedule a delivery and your order will be delivered to your resort or 
sometimes even your room! This saves you from having to pack all kinds of extra 
diapers, water, snacks for the kids, etc.This is also great for those who have 
special diet needs!</li> </ul>These tips will save you so much time and you'll 
be able to enjoy your vacation more because you won't have to worry about these 
details!<br>
<br>
When it comes to souvenirs you may find yourself wondering 
how to get what you buy back to your resort. If you're at a theme park and get 
lots of stuff or maybe something that is just too big to carry around the rest 
of the day, you can have the item sent to your resort for you. You can also 
have the resort ship it to your home so you don't have to worry about how to 
get everything home! However, remember, there are fees involved for this.<br>

<br>Since we're driving we don't need to be so concerned about packing but the 
Garden Grocer may come in good use, for diapers and such. Share | <br>

<h3> Disney Vacation Planning With Kids </h3>  Monday, April 6, 2009  No 
matter how excited you may be to take that trip to Disney, if you travel with 
children, keep this in mind:It IS all about them <br>
There are so many things 
to see and do in WDW as an adult but if you are going with kids remember to 
plan your trip around them. This means you may not get to see and do everything 
thatyou hope to but believe me, that is much better to deal with than unhappy 
children!<br>
<br>
On my family's last trip, we didn't keep the kids in mind as 
well as we should have. Basically, I did all the planning and I was trying to 
find things that would keep everyone happy. From my 85 year old grandma, to my 
mom and MIL, to CJ and then the kids. I wanted everyone to see and do the stuff 
they wanted - I wanted us all to have a great time! It didn't work out so great.
<br> <br>
Here are a few tips, that may seem like common sense but it's 
surprising how many people don't think of them!<br>

<ul> 
<li>Schedule down time - yes, PLAN for it. Don't run yourself and the kids all 
over the place from dusk 'til dawn. If part of your rest time includes relaxing 
by a resort pool, be prepared to have nap time after that! Kids become very 
tired swimming even for only an hour.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Plan meals EARLY! - So many people say breakfasts are a waste - especially 
if you have the meal plan. 'Get the most for your money, have dinners planned 
at expensive places.' That's great if you don't have kids! Breakfasts are 
excellent meals to schedule if you have children. The kids are usually in good 
spirits because it's the beginning of the day. If you do want to have a dinner 
- make reservations early! Between 4-5:30 is a good time. Any later than that 
and kids may be over tired and overstimulated from the day's events.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Decide which rides and attractions you want to see BEFORE you go - This is 
another obvious one but so many people, including us on our last last trip, get 
to a park and then stand there looking at the park map, trying to decide where 
to go first. This wastes time (DUH) and the kids may be overly anxious to go 
and see/do things! Don't make them wait any longer than they may have to.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Many resorts have special kid events planned. Epcot has KIDCOT - These Fun 
Stops are &quot;Kid Stations&quot; located in several Future World pavilions 
and in all of the World Showcase countries. These areas, staffed by Cast 
Members, feature an activity and/or craft table especially for children.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>For more tips and information, visit Planning Disney With Kids</li> </ul>
This time, we already have it set in our minds, this trip is all about the 
kids. Not to say we won't get to see and do things we as adults will love, but 
we will definitely have things planned out much better! Share | <br>

<h3> Where to Meet Disney Characters </h3>  Saturday, April 4, 2009 Photo 
courtesy ofWDWAUTOGRAPHS.COM<br>
<br>
 Have a favorite Disney character you 
hope to meet when you visit Disney World? My kids do and last year when we went 
to Disney, we never did find Buzz Lightyear for Dante and Ariel was not at the 
Princess breakfast in Norway and the Grotto in the MK was closed so Olivia was 
very bummed about that. Wyatt met Mickey - who is his favorite, although you'd 
never know bythis video - LOL <br>
<br>
Well, this year we will be better 
prepared and we will know where to find certain characters! Thanks to
WDWAUTOGRAPHS.COM we now have a good idea where to look for certain characters 
and when!<br>
<br>
Olivia wants to meet Ariel, Dante wants to meet Buzz 
Lightyear and Wyatt, well he still talks about Mickey! CJ's mom wants to see 
the Fairy Godmother again, I want to meet Sully from Monsters Inc. and CJ wants 
to meet Mike Wazowski.<br>
<br>
Fingers crossed we'll all get to meet our 
favorites! Share | <br>

<h3> Tower of Terror </h3> Photo courtesy of wdwinfo.com <br>
<br>
The one 
ride I can't wait to experience again and the one ride I will most likely being 
experiencing alone,The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood 
Studios.<br>
<br>
This ride is a free fall type ride but that isn't even half 
of the reason why I love it! Yes, the thrill of being dropped down, then pulled 
back up and dropped again, or which ever order the Tower decides to send you 
in, is super exciting. I especially love when they open the doors to the 
building and you can see the park for a brief moment as you're falling and 
screaming!<br>
<br>
The entire experience is exciting, from the moment you step 
into the Hotel Lobby - everything is covered by dust and cobwebs. There's a set 
of leather chairs which I found out, are genuine Renaissance antiques!<br>
Then 
you go to the Library. The door closes and the lights dim. As the room gets 
dark, the TV turns on and there in black and white is Rod Serling! He gives 
this unique introduction for that night's episode.<br>
<br>
Once the intro is 
over The Hollywood Tower Hotel appears around you as it was in it's prime. Then 
you see a young couple, a little girl and a bellhop enter the elevator. The 
doors close, they start to go up, lightning hits the building and they vanish.
<p>Suddenly the lights in the Library turn back on, a door opens and you enter 
the &quot;Twilight Zone.&quot; Now you're in the boiler room of the hotel 
waiting to board a 1917 service elevator. This is where the ride begins! You 
get in your seat on the elevator and strap yourself in! The doors close and the 
elevator heads up. First stop, the doors open and you see a very cool optical 
illusion. The doors close again and at the next stop, you move forward.<br>
</p>
<p>This ride is exhilirating from beginning to end...and a bit spooky!<br>

<h3> Disney Itinerary </h3>  Wednesday, April 1, 2009 CJ wet to the travel 
agent and picked up our Disney itinerary! This makes it feel SO REAL! We got 
baggage tags, a print out of the park hours for April and May, a schedule of 
special events that will be going on while we are there, information about the 
Polynesian Resort and a nifty map.<br>
<br>
We also have CJ's mom's stuff - 
since she is flying she has information about the flight and the tag to put on 
her bag so she can use theMagical Express when she gets to the airport! <br>

<br>I am just so excited! We even get to check in online up to 10 days ahead of 
arriving at the resort! Yay!<br>
Click here to see what we have planned for 
this trip!<br>
<br>
So far, what we have planned for our trip seems like enough 
but we may take some time to visit other resorts so we can get an idea of where 
we'd like to stay next year! YES - NEXT YEAR! I am a huge fan of the Polynesian 
Resort but we are strongly considering staying at the Animal kingdom Lodge next 
year, with aSavanna view, of course! <br>
