<p></p> 
<p>1 A child&rsquo;s brain has a higher number of synapses (compared with an 
adult brain) and greater plasticity. This means children naturally can learn 
languages better than adults.<br>
 2 A study which assessed math and language 
scores of 2 groups (1 group studied 30 minutes of Spanish for 1 semester and 
the other comparable group did not) found that the group which studied the 
foreign language for 1 semester had higher math and language scores at the 
school.<br>
 3 A study which looked at the reading scores of average 
intelligence children concluded that there is a close relationship between 
studying a foreign language and better reading scores.</p> 
<p>4 According to the IQ test scores of 2 groups: immersion French class vs. 
regular class, immersion French class students had higher IQ scores (e.g. 
classifying dissimilar objects etc.)<br>
 5 An analysis of the Louisiana State 
Basic skills Tests scores of 13200 3rd and 5th graders showed that students who 
took foreign languages classes did better in the English test.<br>

babies are more perceptive to nonnative languages/easily discriminate different 
sounds<br>

<br> 21 Bilinguals have better memory when it comes to remembering language 
dependent words<br>
 22 One in five Americans speak another language besides 
English at home. Two thirds of the world&rsquo;s children are brought up 
bilingually.<br>
 23 Only bilingual kids in immigrant families can understand 
the true heritage of their ancestors<br>
 24 People who know more than one 
language are better at handling with conflict<br>
 25 People who study 
languages in early age get better in creativity and divergent thinking<br>
 26

Georgia, scored higher on the Math portion of the e Iowa Test Of Basic Skills 
test<br>
 27 Students who study a foreign language in elementary school have 
better communication skills, improved cognitive development and advance 
cultural awareness.<br>
 28 Students who study another language get higher 
scores in college entrance exams<br>

SAT score. Cooper (1987) analyzed 23 metropolitan high schools in the south and 
found that student who studied any foreign language for at least 1 year in 
general had higher SAT scores.<br>
