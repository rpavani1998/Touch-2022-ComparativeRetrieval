<h2>Reading and Language Growth: What It Takes</h2> by Robert Pondiscio<br>

<em>March 14th, 2012</em>

vocabulary<br>
 Posted in Core Knowledge, Curriculum, Education Practice, 
Teaching | 21 Comments &raquo;</p> 
<p><em>Note:&nbsp; This piece also appears on the Washington Post&rsquo;s 
education blog,The Answer Sheet.</em></p> 
<p>For several years, I taught 5th grade in the lowest performing elementary 
school in New York City&rsquo;s lowest performing school district.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Four out of five of my students scored below grade level&mdash;often far below 
grade level&mdash;on their state tests.&nbsp; You could easily look at the test 
scores of my students and conclude, &ldquo;these kids can&rsquo;t read.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>In fact, I never had a single student who couldn&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;read.&rdquo;&nbsp; Put a piece of text in front of them and they could 
all (some with greater fluency than others certainly) verbalize the words in 
front of them, or &ldquo;decode.&rdquo;&nbsp; What they couldn&rsquo;t seem to 
do consistently and competently was to discuss or answer questions about their 
reading.&nbsp; They &ldquo;read it&rdquo; but they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; They could decode, but not comprehend.</p> 
<p>Separating decoding and comprehension is critical to any discussion of 
reading.&nbsp; Decoding is a skill that can&ndash;and must&ndash;be taught in 
the early grades.&nbsp; Students taught with an explicit, systematic phonics 
approach in the early grades should be able to master all the decoding skills 
they need.&nbsp; Decoding is a prerequisite skill but it&rsquo;s not 
reading.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;re readers only when we understand the words we 
decode, and comprehension is<em>not</em> a skill, despite our persistent 
attempts toteach and test it like one.&nbsp; &ldquo;We tend to teach 
comprehension as a series of &lsquo;reading strategies&rsquo; that can be 
practiced and mastered. Unfortunately it really doesn&rsquo;t work that 
way,&rdquo; University of Virginia cognitive scientist Dan Willingham has
written on this blog. &ldquo;The mainspring of comprehension is prior 
knowledge&mdash;the stuff readers already know that enables them to create 
understanding as they read.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This week, the Core Knowledge Foundation, where I work, announced the 
results of an intriguing pilot program that sees reading for the complicated, 
cumulative process it is.&nbsp; Children in ten New York City schools learned 
to read with theCore Knowledge Language Arts (CKLA) program, a comprehensive 
literacy curriculum emphasizing phonics, coherent content knowledge, and oral 
and written language development across a wide range of subjects.&nbsp; CKLA 
has two distinct instructional components: a &ldquo;skills&rdquo; strand that 
teaches decoding; and a &ldquo;listening and learning&rdquo; strand that builds 
background knowledge and vocabulary, primarily through readalouds. Students in 
ten demographically similar control schools received more traditional reading 
instruction&mdash;the kind of balanced literacy, content-agnostic, 
comprehension skills-and-strategies approach I was trained to use with my South 
Bronx 5th graders.&nbsp; The CKLA students showed significantly higher reading 
achievement from kindergarten to 2nd grade than the control group in nearly all 
measures.</p> 
<p>Gratifying stuff, but let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves.&nbsp; The 
primary takeaway from the research, tailored for our 140-character age, was 
&ldquo;new study finds nonfiction curriculum enhances reading comprehension 
skills.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s part of the story.&nbsp; Yes, there is more 
nonfiction in Core Knowledge than is typically taught in the early grades, but 
fiction and poetry are equally represented.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s a secret 
sauce in the curriculum, it probably has as much to do with its emphasis on 
building background knowledge orally.</p> 
<p>Oral language precedes written language; we learn to speak and listen long 
before we can read and write.&nbsp; Freed from the cognitive work of decoding, 
children can more readily understand a story with sophisticated vocabulary when 
it&rsquo;s read out loud than if they had read it on their own. This oral 
language advantage persists for years. A child&rsquo;s ability to take in 
information through reading typically doesn&rsquo;t catch up to his or her 
ability to do so by listening until the 8th grade.&nbsp; Teachers generally 
understand this, which is why class readalouds are a staple of elementary 
school classrooms.&nbsp; But this oral comprehension advantage can also be used 
to build background knowledge in a systematic, coherent way over many years. 
Readalouds are more than just an opportunity for a class to enjoy a great story 
together.&nbsp; Content-rich, nonfiction readalouds, often in narrative form, 
are a central feature of the CKLA program and a powerful way to build a 
child&rsquo;s store of vocabulary and knowledge&ndash;critical components of 
mature reading comprehension.</p> 
<p>This is critical for children from low-income homes and especially those 
where English is a second language.&nbsp; They usually come to school on Day 
One with smaller vocabularies and less background knowledge of the world than 
more advantaged kids, who tend to hear more rich and complex language at home 
and enjoy more opportunities for language and knowledge enrichment.&nbsp; If 
this gap remains unaddressed in school, then demographics becomes, if not 
destiny, then a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp; If we wait until a child can 
read independently to build background knowledge and vocabulary, we are almost 
certainly cementing their knowledge and language deficits permanently in place. 
&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not building background knowledge, you&rsquo;re not 
teaching reading.</p> 
<p>Finally, another important issue to keep in mind is time.&nbsp; The 
greatest casualty of the education reform era has been patience.&nbsp; We 
expect two to three years language growth per year to catch disadvantaged 
children up.&nbsp; The inevitable result is quick fixes that overpromise and 
underdeliver.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s miracle becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s scandal with 
depressing regularity.&nbsp; To understand the nature of language growth and 
the critical role of knowledge to is to understand that there can be no quick 
fixes.&nbsp; The only way to raise achievement and to narrow gaps is through a 
slow and steady investment in the vocabulary and knowledge that are the 
prerequisites of language growth and competence.</p> 
<p>This patient, coherent investment in background knowledge&mdash;so critical 
to success yet so often missing from language arts instruction&mdash;needs to 
be nurtured and grown for the entirety of a child&rsquo;s time in school.&nbsp; 
It can work.&nbsp; Itis working.&nbsp; The New York City pilot study is an 
encouraging first step.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re getting kids in the game.&nbsp; With 
care and patience, we can keep them there.</p>

<p>There will be lots more to say about this shortly, but the New York Times 
this morning has word of promising results from a three-year study of the 
experimental Core Knowledge Language Arts (CKLA) program, which has been 
piloted for the last several years in 10 New York City schools.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;For three years, a pilot program tracked the reading ability of 
approximately 1,000 students at 20 New York City schools, following them from 
kindergarten through second grade. Half of the schools adopted a curriculum 
designed by the education theoristE. D. Hirsch Jr.&rsquo;s Core Knowledge 
Foundation. The other 10 used a variety of methods, but most fell under the 
definition of &ldquo;balanced literacy,&rdquo; an approach that was spread 
citywide by former Schools ChancellorJoel I. Klein, beginning in 2003.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The study found that second graders who were taught to read using 
the Core Knowledge program scored significantly higher on reading comprehension 
tests than did those in the comparison schools.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>A web page on the Core Knowledge website links to the the NYC Department of 
Ed&rsquo;s data,background on the program, a presentation on the research 
underpinnings andhow the curriculum works with Common Core State Standards.</p>

<h2>Meet the Children Where They Are&hellip;and Keep Them There</h2> by Robert 
Pondiscio<br>

 Posted in Core Knowledge, Curriculum, Education Practice, 
Educational Policy, Literacy, Teaching | 42 Comments &raquo;</p> 
<p>A lot of people whose opinions I respect don&rsquo;t care much for Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS).&nbsp; Some of my friends view the standards as an
abuse of power or coercive.&nbsp; Some think them no better or even worse than 
their existing state standards.&nbsp; Others bemoan the lack of specificity.</p>
<p>Say what you will about CCSS, but there are three big ideas embedded within 
the English Language Arts standards that deserve to be at the very heart of 
literacy instruction in U.S. classrooms, with or with or without standards 
themselves:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1. Students should read as much nonfiction as fiction.</p> 
<p>2. Schools should ensure all children&mdash;and especially disadvantaged 
children&mdash;build coherent background knowledge that is essential to mature 
reading comprehension.</p> 
<p>3. Success in reading comprehension depends less on &ldquo;personal 
response&rdquo; and more on close reading of text.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In an astonishing commentary in Education Week, Joanne Yatvin, past 
president of the National Council of Teachers of English (!) reads the Common 
Core ELA Standards and pronounces herself &ldquo;truly alarmed&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;aghast at the vision of the dreariness and harshness of the classrooms 
they aim to create.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Precisely because of the three 
ideas enumerated above.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m alarmed and aghast that anyone can fail to connect building 
background knowledge with language growth, or long-term success in reading 
comprehension.&nbsp; Not for nothing are the standards titled &ldquo;Common 
Core State Standards for English Language Arts &amp; Literacy in History/Social 
Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects, K-5.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yatvin&rsquo;s bill of particulars boils down to a complaint that all that 
subject matter content is too hard, too soon and too boring for children. The 
standards &ldquo;overestimate the intellectual, physiological, and emotional 
development of young children,&rdquo; she writes. Her smoking gun is within the
publisher&rsquo;s criteria that accompanies the standards:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>In kindergarten-grade 2, the most notable shifts in the standards when 
compared to state standards include a focus on reading informational text and 
building a coherent knowledge within and across grades; a more in-depth 
approach to vocabulary development; and a requirement that students encounter 
sufficiently complex text through reading, writing, listening, and 
speaking.&nbsp; By underscoring what matters most in the standards, the 
criteria illustrate what shifts must take place in the next generation of 
curricula, including paring away elements that distract from or are at odds 
with the Common Core State Standards.</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty strong dose of academia for children just beginning 
their schooling, with not even a &lsquo;spoonful of sugar to make the medicine 
go down,&rdquo; she writes, forgetting that the teachers are free to dispense 
as many spoonfuls of C6H12O6&nbsp; as they see fit to enable the prescription 
to enter the digestive tract.</p> 
<p>News flash: It&rsquo;s precisely the lack of coherent background 
knowledge&mdash;the kind of taken-for-granted knowledge of the world, and the 
gains in vocabulary that accompany it&mdash;that is holding back reading 
comprehension and language growth among our most disadvantaged children.&nbsp; 
This is something that CCSS nails, emphatically and correctly.&nbsp; If 
you&rsquo;re not building background knowledge,you&rsquo;re not teaching reading
.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;For young children, the focus on academic vocabulary seems 
strange,&rdquo; continues Yatvin, apparently believing teachers are expected to 
read directly from the Common Core Standards during story time on the 
rug.&nbsp; &ldquo;At this time in their development, would it not be more 
sensible for children to learn words connected to their everyday lives and 
their interests rather than to things and experiences as yet unknown?&rdquo; 
she ask.</p> 
<p>Well, no.&nbsp; It would not be more sensible. Most of the words we acquire 
we learn not through memorization or direct instruction, but in context.&nbsp; 
So while it certainly it makes sense to connect words to kids &ldquo;everyday 
lives and experiences&rdquo; it&rsquo;s something very close to educational 
malpractice not to make a concerted effort to expand a child&rsquo;s knowledge 
base beyond their immediate experiences.&nbsp; If there is anything that 
ensures a low-level of academic achievement it is the idea that kids can only 
learn from their direct experiences.Matthew Effect, anyone? It is incredibly 
condescending even to suggest that if a child cannot personally relate to a 
story or topic, they can&rsquo;t possibly be interested or successful.</p> 
<p>Yet Yatvin also doesn&rsquo;t much care for the &ldquo;significant increase 
in nonfiction materials at all grade levels&rdquo; and CCSS&rsquo;s call for 
&ldquo;a mix of 50 percent literary and 50 percent informational text, 
including reading in [English/language arts], science, social studies, and the 
arts.&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The fact that fiction now dominates the elementary curriculum is not 
the result of educators&rsquo; decisions about what is best for children, but a 
reflection of children&rsquo;s developmental stages, their interests, and their 
limited experience in the fields of science, geography, history, and 
technology. It is one thing for a child to read<em>The Little Engine That Could
</em> for the pleasure of the story and quite another for her to comprehend the 
inner workings of a locomotive.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Wait.&nbsp; Children have limited knowledge in science, geography, history 
and technology, so we shouldn&rsquo;tmuddy their minds with such marginalia
?&nbsp; The story is ripe with opportunities to build background knowledge, not 
about (strawman alert!) &ldquo;the inner workings of a locomotive,&rdquo; but 
colors, mountains, trains and transportation, to name but a few.&nbsp; There 
are no shortage of age appropriate, richly illustrated nonfiction picture books 
that would go a long way toward building prior knowledge on these and many 
other topics that are a natural extension of<em>The Little Engine That Could.
</em></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m all for reading for the pleasure of the story.&nbsp; But start 
building background knowledge of the world beyond a child&rsquo;s immediate 
surroundings today, and you geometrically expand the number of stories a child 
can read for pleasure tomorrow.&nbsp; Weirdly, Yatvin gets this.&nbsp; She just 
seems reluctant to teach it:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Reading any text requires more than decoding, fluency, and inferring 
meaning from context; the reader must form mental images of things mentioned 
based on previous experience or imagination. Although illustrations in many 
nonfiction books help considerably, there is a limit to how many unfamiliar 
things can be adequately illustrated in a book for young children.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Right.&nbsp; Which is exactly why we need to expand a child&rsquo;s base of 
knowledge, not view it as too high a hurdle to clear.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, the authors show their contempt for teachers&rsquo; 
competence, the use of supplementary materials, and children&rsquo;s 
experiences,&rdquo; Yatvin claims. &nbsp;But she shows her contempt for 
children in her assumption that if it&rsquo;s not a part of a child&rsquo;s 
everyday experience they couldn&rsquo;t possibly be interested or expected to 
appreciate or understand it.</p> 
<p>By placing subject matter content at the very heart of English Language 
Arts instruction from the first days of school, the authors of the Common Core 
Standards got it absolutely right.&nbsp; In order to read, write, speak and 
listen with comprehension, children need more content, not less. &nbsp;&nbsp;We 
learn new words by understanding the context in which we hear unfamiliar 
words.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every reading teacher has encouraged a struggling reader to 
&ldquo;activate your prior knowledge&rdquo; when reading a difficult passage; 
or to &ldquo;use your context clues&rdquo; when stumped by an unfamiliar 
word.&nbsp; Where &ndash; where exactly &ndash; do we expect that prior 
knowledge and context to come from if building it is not a primary function of 
language arts instruction?</p> 
<p>Are there problems with Common Core Standards? Certainly. But there are far 
more problems with a view of literacy and teaching that boils down to 
&ldquo;meet the children where they are&hellip;and keep them there.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Constructivizing STEM</h2> by Robert Pondiscio<br>
<em>February 22nd, 2012

<p>Tags: constructivism, engineering, facts, hands-on learning, math, science
<br> Posted in Core Knowledge, Curriculum, Education News, Education Practice, 
Research and Reports, Students, Teaching | 2 Comments &raquo;</p> 
<p><em>The following guest post is by Katharine Beals, who blogs about 
education atOut in Left Field, where this post also appears.&nbsp; &mdash; rp. 
</em></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to detect a certain worry among those who write STEM 
articles&nbsp;for Education Week that the drive to educate students for careers 
in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics might include a drive to 
increase core scientific and mathematical content at the expense of things that 
Constructivists hold dear. Things, for example, like &ldquo;model 
building,&rdquo; &ldquo;data analysis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;communicating 
findings.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>These are what Jean Moon and Susan Rundell Singer, in their&nbsp;backpage 
Edweek Commentary onBringing STEM into Focus, want to be sure schools&nbsp;are 
focusing on:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Re-visioning school science around science and engineering practices, such 
as model-building, data analysis, and evidence-based reasoning, is a 
transformative step, a step found in the NRC report, which is critical to STEM 
learners and teachers, both K-12 and postsecondary. It puts forward the message 
that knowledge-building practices found under the STEM umbrella are practices 
frequently held in common by STEM professionals across the disciplines as they 
investigate, model, communicate, and explain the natural and designed world.</p>
</blockquote> 
<p>Not that this is all that Moon and Singer&nbsp;care about. They also care 
about big ideas, which they divide into two categories: &ldquo;crosscutting 
concepts (major ideas that cut across disciplines)&rdquo;, and 
&ldquo;disciplinary core ideas (ideas with major explanatory power across 
science and engineering disciplines.&rdquo; The former include &ldquo;scale, 
proportion, and &ldquo;quantity or the use of patterns;&rdquo; the authors 
don&rsquo;t cite any examples of the latter.</p> 
<p>Besides &ldquo;practices&rdquo; and&nbsp;&rdquo;ideas,&rdquo; the authors 
mention &ldquo;strategies&rdquo; and &ldquo;tools&rdquo; (again, without 
specific examples). What they don&rsquo;t mention is underlying<em>content</em>
, except to say:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Lest some believe this is setting up another false dichotomy in science or 
mathematics education between content and process, let us quickly add a strong 
evidentiary note: Epistemic practices and the learning and knowledge produced 
through such practices as building models, arguing from evidence, and 
communicating findings increase the likelihood that students will learn the 
ideas of science or engineering and mathematics at a deeper, more enduring 
level than otherwise would be the case. Research evidence consistently supports 
this assertion.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what &ldquo;research evidence&rdquo; means, but I gather 
that it doesn&rsquo;t include the research evidence&nbsp;that cognitive 
scientist Dan Willingham cites in support of the idea that students aren&rsquo;t
 little scientists and need&nbsp;a foundation of years of core knowledge before 
being ready to function as actual scientists.</p> 
<p>In promoting their ideas as &ldquo;transformative,&rdquo; the authors 
are&nbsp;overlooking the fact&nbsp;that the kinds of constructivist 
practices&nbsp;they&nbsp;desire are already standard in&nbsp;many schools 
(particularly those held up as models for others). If&nbsp;they want to promote 
something truly transformative for STEM,&nbsp;they should instead&nbsp;be 
advocating&nbsp;a&nbsp;reinstatement of the&nbsp;years of solid, content-based 
instruction in math and science that many of our K12 schools used to offer (and 
that one still finds in schools in most developed countries around the world).

<h2>Nonfiction Read Alouds: A Lost Opportunity?</h2> by Robert Pondiscio<br>

<em>February 17th, 2012</em> 
<p>Tags: language proficiency, readalouds, vocabulary<br>
 Posted in Core 
Knowledge, Education Practice, Teaching | 10 Comments &raquo;</p> 
<p>Part of my required reading is the daily Accomplished Teacher SmartBrief, a 
summary of education news.&nbsp;Yesterday&rsquo;s email carried the subject 
line, &ldquo;Are there benefits to reading aloud?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is roughly akin to a newsletter for doctors headlined, &ldquo;Are 
there benefits to quitting smoking and exercise?&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be 
mighty surprised to learn there are still teachers who need to be sold on the 
benefits of reading aloud to students.&nbsp; But the SmartBrief headlinelinks 
to a smart Edweek piece from Donalyn Miller, a 6th grade language arts teacher 
in Texas, on the benefits of read alouds, including &ldquo;building 
community,&rdquo; &ldquo;exposing kids to new authors and genres,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;supporting developing readers.&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Reading aloud removes roadblocks to comprehension like unfamiliar 
vocabulary and contextualizes words developing readers do not know. Listening 
to a fluent reader gives students a reading role model for their own oral 
reading skills, too. Since listening comprehension is higher than reading 
comprehension, you can read books that are a higher reading level than your 
students can read alone.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>She&rsquo;s completely correct on all of these points, but further 
explication is worthwhile.&nbsp; If anything, Miller undersells the value of 
reading aloud.&nbsp; When students listen to a readaloud, cognitive bandwidth 
that might ordinarily be devoted to decoding is redirected toward the 
vocabulary and content of the reading.&nbsp; We learn vocabulary primarily in 
context, not by memorization. Thus readalouds build language proficiency by 
exposing kids to sophisticated language well above their independent&nbsp; 
reading level.</p> 
<p>But I&rsquo;d wager most teachers leave untapped a lot of the potential of 
readalouds.&nbsp; Pop quiz:&nbsp; how many of the last ten books you read to 
your class were nonfiction?&nbsp;&nbsp; You probably answered either 
&ldquo;zero&rdquo; or &ldquo;one.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a lost 
opportunity.&nbsp; The same principles that make it worthwhile to read fiction 
aloud are even more true for nonfiction. Plus, nonfiction often has rich, 
domain-specific vocabulary.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re more likely to hear words like 
&ldquo;orbit,&rdquo; &ldquo;zenith,&rdquo; &ldquo;solar,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;celestial,&rdquo; in a book on astronomy.&nbsp; Readalouds not only grow 
vocabulary, they are the best way to build critical background knowledge, which 
is essential for later reading comprehension.</p> 
<p>Read alouds also have value well past the primary grades.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
fairly obvious that oral language competence precedes written language 
proficiency (we learn to speak and listen long before we can read and 
write).&nbsp; What&rsquo;s less well known is a fact my colleagueAlice Wiggins 
likes to point out: reading comprehension typically doesn&rsquo;t catch up 
until about 8th grade.&nbsp; This means that a strong case can be made for read 
alouds to building knowledge, vocabulary, and fluency through and including 
middle school.</p> 
<p>Miller&rsquo;s piece touts &ldquo;World Read Aloud Day&rdquo; on March 7, 
2012 and suggests every day should be read aloud day.&nbsp; Agreed.&nbsp; But 
read alouds should be for more than just stories and poems.&nbsp; Tellingly, 
Miller suggests ten books for upper elementary students to hear out loud. The 
only one that&rsquo;s not fiction and poetry is a memoir by<em>Hatchet</em> 
author Gary Paulsen.</p> 
<p>Building knowledge and vocabulary remain the royal road to reading 
comprehension.&nbsp; Reading to students across subject areas&ndash;not just 
stories and poems&ndash;just might be the most underutilized strategy in the 
teacher&rsquo;s tool kit.</p>

<h2>A Visit to the Core Knowledge Auto Body Shop</h2> by Robert Pondiscio<br>

<p>The New York Times offers up a piece about a New York City school that has 
put building background knowledge at the heart of its curriculum.&nbsp; P.S. 
142, a school in lower Manhattan hard by the Williamsburg Bridge &ldquo;has 
made real life experiences the center of academic lessons,&rdquo; the paper 
notes, &ldquo;in hopes of improving reading and math skills by broadening 
children&rsquo;s frames of reference.&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Experiences that are routine in middle-class homes are not for P.S. 
142 children. When Dao Krings, a second-grade teacher, asked her students 
recently how many had never been inside a car, several, including Tyler 
Rodriguez, raised their hands. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been inside a bus,&rsquo; 
Tyler said. &lsquo;Does that count?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is not a Core Knowledge school, but the teachers and staff clearly 
understand the critical connection between background knowledge, vocabulary and 
language proficiency.&nbsp; The Times describes the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;field 
trips to the sidewalk,&rdquo; with children routinely visiting parking garages 
and auto body shops, or examining features of every day life.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;In early February the second graders went around the block to study 
Muni-Meters and parking signs. They learned new vocabulary words, like 
&lsquo;parking,&rsquo; &lsquo;violations&rsquo; and &lsquo;bureau.&rsquo; 
JenLee Zhong calculated that if Ms. Krings put 50 cents in the Muni-Meter and 
could park for 10 minutes, for 40 minutes she would have to put in $2. They 
discovered that a sign that says &lsquo;No Standing Any Time&rsquo; is not 
intended for kids like them on the sidewalk.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The &ldquo;no standing&rdquo; example illustrates perfectly how easily a 
lack of shared references and experiences conspire to thwart 
comprehension.&nbsp; It is simply inconceivable that a non-driver would connect 
the act of balancing on two feet with the act of idling by the curb in a 
car.&nbsp; Our language is deeply idiomatic and context driven.&nbsp; Even a 
simple word like &ldquo;shot&rdquo; means something different on a basketball 
court, a doctor&rsquo;s office, or when the repairman says your dishwasher is 
&ldquo;shot.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Obvious?&nbsp; Sure it is.&nbsp; To <em>you.</em> But you&rsquo;re not a 
low-income kid who has never sat in a car.&nbsp; Or stood in one.&nbsp; These 
things either need to be taught explicitly or experienced first-hand.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Reading with comprehension assumes a shared prior knowledge,&rdquo; 
the Times notes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gratifying to see this point rendered as if 
it&rsquo;s widely known in our schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the piece ends on a 
bittersweet note.&nbsp; A local superintendent says he wished more principals 
would adopt the program but that they&rsquo;re fearful. &ldquo;There is so much 
pressure systematically to do well on the tests, and this may not boost scores 
right away,&rdquo; Daniel Feigelson said. &ldquo;To do this you&rsquo;d have to 
be willing to take the long view.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The long view should win out simply because there <em>is</em> no short 
view. At least not one that has been proven effective. Language growth is a 
slow growing plant,E.D. Hirsch points out.&nbsp; There is no shortcut to 
building the vocabulary and background knowledge that drives comprehension. All 
the reading strategies instruction in the worldcan&rsquo;t compensate.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s my suggestion:&nbsp; Although I love the phrase, PS 142 should 
immediately stop calling these activities &ldquo;field trips to the 
sidewalk.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Call it &ldquo;test prep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because that&rsquo;s what it really 
is.</p>

<p><em>The following post by Lynne Munson appeared originally on the blog of 
Common Core, a Washington, DC-based organization that works to promote a 
liberal arts, core curriculum in U.S. schools.&nbsp; Munson is Common 
Core&rsquo;sexecutive director and a former deputy chairman of the National 
Endowment for the Humanities &mdash; rp.<br>
</em></p> 
<p>I challenge anyone to think of a nation that works as hard as we do to find 
silver linings in its educational failures. On Tuesday morning NAEP reported 
that, in the course of two years, our nation&rsquo;s 4th and 8th graders 
improved a single point (on a 500-point scale) in three of four reading and 
math assessments, and flatlined on the fourth. If you look at figures plotting 
NAEP scores over the last 30 years, any upward slope in the data is nearly 
undetectable to the naked eye. Analysts have spent the last few days slicing 
and dicing this data and making unconvincing arguments that some positive 
trends can be detected.</p> 
<p>But the reality is that these results are appalling&mdash;particularly if 
you consider the massive federal funding increases, intense reform debates, and 
the incessant promises of new technologies that have dominated the education 
discussion for nearly two decades. We have spent a great deal and worked very 
hard but gotten unimpressive results. And this is in reading and math where, to 
the detriment of so many other core subjects, we&rsquo;ve aimed nearly all of 
our firepower.</p> 
<p>Einstein* defined &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; as &ldquo;doing the same thing 
over and over but expecting different results.&rdquo; Well, my bet is that 
Einstein would have deemed NAEP data absolute proof of America&rsquo;s 
educational insanity.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve spent the last twenty years attempting to make what, on the 
surface, appears to be a diverse, creative, and wide-ranging series of reforms 
to public education. We&rsquo;ve tried to bring market pressures to bear 
through charters and choice. We&rsquo;ve attempted to set high standards and 
given high-stakes tests. We&rsquo;ve experimented with shrinking school and 
class sizes. We&rsquo;ve focused on &ldquo;21st century skills&rdquo; and used 
the latest technologies. We&rsquo;ve collected and analyzed data on an 
unprecedented scale. We&rsquo;ve experimented with a seemingly endless array of 
&ldquo;strategies&rdquo; for teaching reading and math and have tried to 
&ldquo;differentiate&rdquo; for every imaginable &ldquo;type&rdquo; of student. 
And we&rsquo;ve paid dearly in tax dollars and in other ways for each of these 
&ldquo;reforms.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Interestingly, all of these reforms have one thing in common (aside from 
their failure to improve student performance except in isolated instances): 
None deals directly with the content of what we teach our students.</p> 
<p>Maybe we need to give content a chance. What I mean by 
&ldquo;content&rdquo; is the actual knowledge that is imbedded in quality 
curricula. Knowledge of things like standard algorithms, poetry, 
America&rsquo;s past, foreign languages, great painters, chemistry, our form of 
government, and much more. There are a few widely used curricula (e.g. 
International Baccalaureate, Latin schools curricula, Core Knowledge) that 
effectively incorporate much of this knowledge base. And performance data 
strongly suggests that these curricula work for ALL students.</p> 
<p>So let&rsquo;s draw on such successes and, sure, conduct more research, do 
more experiments, and spend more money. But let&rsquo;s do it to build a shared 
understanding what our students need to learn &mdash;the content they need to 
learn. Then let&rsquo;s use the best technology available and make the kind of 
investments we need in professional development to teach that content 
effectively. In light of the poor results other approaches have yielded, is 
there any other sane course?</p>

<h2>College Readiness and Cultural Literacy</h2> by Robert Pondiscio<br>

October 24th, 2011</em> 
<p> Posted in Core Knowledge, Education Practice, Education Theory, Teaching |

<p><em>A version of this post originally appeared at Socially Produced, a blog 
written by Fernando Reyes, a 10th grade World History instructor at Yes Prep 
SW, in Houston, and is reprinted with his permission.&nbsp; A first-year 
teacher, Mr. Reyes works predominantly with students from low-income 
communities and ethnic minorities.&nbsp; He is a Yale University Teacher 
Preparation program graduate&nbsp; &mdash; rp.</em></p> 
<p>YES Prep SW is a high-performing charter school. When I say 
high-performing, I mean it: our test scores are among the highest in the state, 
we send 100% of our students to four-year colleges, and the selectivity of the 
colleges our students is only increasing.</p> 
<p>I recently showed a quiz on Islam I was giving my students to a couple of 
friends of mine who have attended college and taken classes on Islam. The quiz 
covered material they would have covered in their college classes in 3-4 weeks 
of class. I did it in four classes, with a bit of homework. My students did 
well. I can confidently say that I have great students and that they work hard. 
Our goal here at SW is to prepare our students not just to be college-eligible, 
but to be college-ready.</p> 
<p>What does it mean to prepare a student for college? At our campus, we talk 
openly about college-readiness as our standard. Our students should be ready to 
academically handle the rigors of collegiate life, particularly since a large 
minority of our students will be attending selective or highly-selective 
universities. Equally important, however, is preparing them for the culture 
shock that many collegiate environments will be for them, particularly the 
further away they get from the city of Houston.</p> 
<p>A couple of quick anecdotes will suffice: only 6 of my 125 students have 
seen any Star Wars movie. Only one had seen the Godfather. The concept of 
&lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; is completely foreign to them. Even the game of 
baseball is a mystery to most them.</p> 
<p>These are not dumb students. Most of them are hard working, quick-witted 
and sharp. They are held to more rigorous standards that I and many of my 
fellow Yale alumni were held during high school. However, the gaps in certain 
cultural knowledge is extreme.</p> 
<p>This matters. Knowledge of baseball, the Godfather and Star Wars may seem 
trivial, but they are symptoms of a much larger conundrum: the inability to 
gather the tokens of a privileged culture they will have to enter in college 
and in larger American life.</p> 
<p>E.D. Hirsch first aired these concerns in a big way 1988 with his 
bestselling book,<em>Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know</em>. 
In the updated edition, Hirsch discusses his central thesis:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A shared cultural literacy &ldquo;enables grandparents to communicate with 
grandchildren, southerners with midwesterners, whites with blacks, Asians with 
Latinos, and Republicans with Democrats &ndash; no matter where they were 
educated. If each local school system imparts the traditional reference points 
of literate culture, then everybody is able to communicate with strangers. That 
is a good definition of literacy: the ability to communicate effectively with 
strangers. We help people in the underclass rise economically by teaching them 
how to communicate effectively beyond a narrow social sphere, and that can only 
be accomplished by teaching them shared, traditional literacy culture. We only 
make social and economic progress by teaching everybody to read and 
communicate, which means teaching myths and facts that are predominantly 
traditional.</p> 
<p>Those who evade this inherent conservatism of literacy in the name of 
multicultural antielitism are in in effect elitists of an extreme sort. 
Traditionally educated themselves, and highly literate, these self-appointed 
protectors of minority cultures have advised schools to pursue a course that 
has condemned minorities to illiteracy. The disadvantaged students for whom 
antielitist solicitude is expressed are the very ones who suffer when we fail 
to introduce traditional literate culture into the earliest grades.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>His pivot is important and it is one I recognize as vital to the project of 
educating students from environments that aren&rsquo;t middle class or white, 
particularly as I educate them for a future where hopefully, because of their 
educational credentials, they have to engage and be a part of that world. Lisa 
Delpit, a personal hero of mine, writes about this challenge in<em>Other 
People&rsquo;s Children</em>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Progressive white teachers seem to say to their black students, &ldquo;Let 
me help you find your voice. I promise not to criticize one note as you search 
for your own song.&rdquo; But the black teachers say, &rdquo; I&rsquo;ve heard 
your song loud and clear. Now, I want to teach you to harmonize with the rest 
of the world.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Furthermore, Delpit goes on to describe the reality of the culture of power 
that myself and my students have to deal with with and what many minority 
parents see as the role of schooling and education:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There are codes or rules for participating in power; that tis, there is a 
&ldquo;culture of power.&rdquo; The rules of the culture of power are a 
reflection of the rules of the culture of those who have power. If you are not 
already a participant in the culture of power, being told explicitly the rules 
of that culture makes acquiring power easier.</p> 
<p>[&hellip;]</p> 
<p>But parents who don&rsquo;t function within that culture often want 
something else. They want to ensure that the school provides their children 
with discourse patterns, interreactional styles and spoken and written language 
codes that will allow them success in the larger society.</p> 
<p>It was the lack of attention to this concern that created such a negative 
outcry in the black community when well-intentioned white liberal educators 
introduced &ldquo;dialect readers.&rdquo; These were seen as a plot to prevent 
schools from teaching the linguistic aspects of the culturel of power, thus 
dooming black children to a permanent outsider caste. As one parent demanded, 
&ldquo;My kids know how to be black &ndash; you all teach them how to be 
successful int he white man&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>To quickly summarize before continuing: power exists. As an educator who is 
training students to enter a culture of power that is not theirs, I have to 
make it explicit and I have to teach the cultural literacy behind the 
institutions of power they&rsquo;ll have to navigate. I cannot, in good 
conscience, pretend that their cultural experiences will be valued for all that 
they are worth and that they won&rsquo;t be judged for not having those markers 
of cultural knowledge. I forced myself to read the &lsquo;classics&rsquo; of 
Western Civilization before attending school, but I constantly felt that the 
philosophers and ideas that were being dropped on a regular basis completely 
baffled me. I still can&rsquo;t exactly tell the difference between the Rolling 
Stones, Led Zeppelin and other famous rock bands, though I at least know a 
phrase or two from popular songs.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s not the totality of my challenge, however. The difficulty 
arises that I have to convince them, amidst all of this, that their cultural 
experiences are legitimate. Their love of Tejano music or their knowledge of 
the urban, ethnically diverse and youthful language that pervades their culture 
is important and it is a travesty of reality that their experiences are not 
considered part of the mainstream language of cultural literacy. I need to make 
them not feel ashamed of their culture as I did many times as an undergraduate: 
how many times did I instinctively lower the volume on my Tejano music?<strong>
Too many</strong>.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, the point is to arm them for a future where they can create a 
fundamentally more fair world. In a bit of practical philosophy, you need the 
Master&rsquo;s tools to dismantle the gate. You can&rsquo;t simply slam into it 
repeatedly.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a challenge, but one I feel I&rsquo;m surprisingly well-equipped 
to handle. I&rsquo;ve grown up in communities where the contextual clues of 
power are completely lacking, but I learned first-hand what power differentials 
do. I moved to a university environment where I both had to negotiate the rules 
of power, but just as important, work to change them and make them more 
accepting. Yes, it is hard work. In many ways it&rsquo;s unfair.</p> 
<p>My students will succeed, they will be &lsquo;cultured&rsquo; and gosh 
darnit, they&rsquo;ll prove some people wrong.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year teacher in World History, working predominantly with 
students from low-income communities and ethnic minorities. I&rsquo;m a Yale 
University Teacher Preparation program graduate.</p>

<p><em>This op-ed by Gregory R. Meece, school director of Newark Charter 
School, a Core Knowledge</em><em>Visitation School,</em><em>&nbsp;originally 
appeared in theNews Journal in Wilmington, Delaware.&nbsp;&nbsp;Newark Charter 
School was named a 2010 National Blue Ribbon School &mdash; rp.</em></p> 
<p>Growing up in Newark, I was much like the average kid today &mdash; 
shooting hoops in the driveway, attempting to duplicate Evel Knievel stunts on 
my bike, spending too many hours watching what mymom used to call &ldquo;the 
idiot box.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But unlike most kids today (and a good many adults) I could liken the 
experience of tubing on the White Clay Creek to a Huck Finn adventure.</p> 
<p>I could compare a spring afternoon to an Impressionist painting; describe a 
sit-in on a college campus as an act of &ldquo;civil disobedience;&rdquo; and 
pick out the grandfather character in the composition &ldquo;Peter and the 
Wolf&rdquo; by the sound of the bassoon. And, of course, I learned none of this 
in school.</p> 
<p>I was fortunate. I grew up in a home filled with &ldquo;core 
knowledge.&rdquo; The &ldquo;haves&rdquo; in this country had &ldquo;core 
knowledge&rdquo; in their homes too. Many &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t. 
But if they were lucky they attended a school that stressed the importance of, 
well, important things. They were exposed to that which binds our culture 
together, a common understanding &mdash; cultural literacy. Those who wish to 
function in the world of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; need to know what they know. 
In a democratic society, it is publiceducation that should be the equalizing 
force. It should give every child a fair chance to achieve success. But it 
hasn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>For decades, American public schooling has veered toward so-called 
&ldquo;reforms&rdquo; in curriculum and instruction. These feel-good 
initiatives typically offer vague theories of learning at the expense of 
coherent content. What students need to know has become relative or, worse, 
irrelevant. Teaching Johnny about his neighborhood is just as useful as 
teaching him about the Renaissance. The problem is, if we only teach children 
about their neighborhoods they are forever limited by the boundaries of those 
neighborhoods. And for too many kids, their neighborhoods aren&rsquo;t great.
</p> 
<p>Teachers are conditioned to plan lessons around what they believe students 
might be interested in. Effortless engagement, not knowledge, is the goal. And 
it is the student who comes from a disadvantaged background who is cheated by 
it the most.</p> 
<p>Core Knowledge is a coherent list of what every American student through 
8th grade should know. It is not a curriculum, a movement, or a reform. The 
scope and sequence of Core Knowledge was developed by university professor E. 
D. Hirsch, Jr. and the Core Knowledge Foundation after years of 
consensus-building among teachers, scholars, scientists, and others.</p> 
<p>Hirsch realized that there was something missing from what nearly every 
other &ldquo;expert&rdquo; on education was writing about &mdash; namely, 
common sense. But the education establishment cautioned that a curriculum that 
exposed fifth graders to atoms, molecules and compounds and sixth graders to 
plate tectonics was developmentally inappropriate (translation: &ldquo;hard and 
boring&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>The freedom granted charter schools allowed Newark Charter School to adopt 
Core Knowledge as the content portion of its curriculum. We found that the 
school&rsquo;s curriculum not only met, but exceeded the state standards. While 
Core Knowledge is heavy in history and geography, Delaware standards demand 
more economics and civics. It wasn&rsquo;t that the Core Knowledge Foundation 
didn&rsquo;t believe that economics and civics were important. Rather, it found 
that schools became so enamored with &ldquo;social studies&rdquo; that they 
forgot to teach world and American history and geography. It got to the point 
where the late-show comics were having a field day interviewing adults on the 
street who couldn&rsquo;t locate China on a map.</p> 
<p>Knowledge builds on knowledge. In the words of columnist William Raspberry 
writing about the need for Core Knowledge schools in African-American 
communities, &ldquo;The more you know, the smarter you get.&rdquo; Hirsch calls 
it &ldquo;Intellectual Velcro.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If you were a lucky kid you were exposed to the events, literature, ideas 
and arts that changed our world. If you were not so lucky, you might be like 
the person at a party who doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; the joke the host 
just told. You didn&rsquo;t understand the meaning behind the punch 
line&rsquo;s reference to a &ldquo;Trojan Horse.&rdquo; But our school&rsquo;s 
11-year-olds would be laughing out loud!</p> 
<p>A content-rich curriculum isn&rsquo;t the only reason for a school&rsquo;s 
success. The most important resource in any school is the classroom teacher. 
But when good instruction is coupled with a curriculum rich with substance, 
clarity and cohesiveness, young students will have doors opened to places they 
never dreamt of. Core Knowledge provides a path to all of the most desirable 
education goals: the ability to think critically and problem solve, greater 
reading comprehension, and higher test scores &mdash; because all of these 
things are functions of a broad base of background knowledge.</p> 
<p>The role of a democratic &ldquo;common school&rdquo; is to make sure that 
&ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; is not only for the privileged. Having 
access to important &ldquo;core knowledge&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t school reform. 
It&rsquo;s social justice.</p>

 Posted in Assessment and Testing, Core 
Knowledge, accountability | 45 Comments &raquo;</p> 
<p>Over at Joanne Jacobs, they&rsquo;re talking about Sol Stern&rsquo;s recent 
article on the New York City Core Knowledge Language Arts program. Regular 
commenter Stuart Buck, as he is&nbsp;wont to do, looks to turn the discussion 
into a referendum on&nbsp;what he perceives to be the anti-reform stance of 
Diane Ravitch and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern&rsquo;s piece,&nbsp;he writes,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;supports the idea that we need a broad curriculum, etc. On the other 
hand, it completely undermines their insistence that testing inevitably leads 
poor beleaguered educators to teach to the test, to narrow the curriculum, and 
even to cheat and lie out of the sheer pressure. After all, if kids can 
actually do BETTER on the tests with none of the latter misbehavior, then 
testing isn&rsquo;t the horror it&rsquo;s made out to be.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Later Buck offers that it is not possible to hold these two ideas in 
one&rsquo;s head at the same time:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the STAKES attached to the testing that inevitably 
lead educators to teach to the test, narrow the curriculum, and cheat.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>2. Broad and rich curricula like Core Knowledge would actually allow 
educators to IMPROVE test scores above and beyond a narrow test-prep curriculum.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>True, a&nbsp;patient&nbsp;investment in knowledge and language 
growth&nbsp;will raise scores over time, but the key phrase is<em>over time.
</em>&nbsp; There is no reason to expect an&nbsp;instant dividend&nbsp;from a 
knowledge-rich curriculum.&nbsp; Indeed, because reading tests arede facto 
tests of background knowledge, there is every reason NOT to expect the results 
to show for several years when the cumulative effect of broad knowledge 
acquisition asserts itself.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The high stakes associated with reading tests may not preclude teaching a 
knowledge-rich curriculum, but it&nbsp;arguably disincentivizes it.&nbsp; If 
you are expected to show at least one year&rsquo;s growth in one year&rsquo;s 
time (a concept I&rsquo;ve never been able to wrap my mind around) you are far 
more likely to resort defensively to test-prep and &ldquo;reading 
strategies&rdquo; instruction rather than teach material that might not show up 
on a state exam this year, or ever.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The entire proposition is that knowledge and vocabulary are a &ldquo;slow 
growing plant,&rdquo; asE.D. Hirsch has said. The results show up in the long 
term. That&rsquo;s hard to reconcile with&nbsp;high stakes reading tests 
that&nbsp;demand results now.</p>
