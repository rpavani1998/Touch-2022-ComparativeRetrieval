<h4>COMMITMENT<br>
 AN AGGREEMENT OR PLEDGE TO DO SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE </h4>
<h5> Most of the time, a decision to get a dog is by choice. Whether it's a 
new pup or a rescue. Owning a dog is much more than feeding, watering and 
letting out the back door. Dogs are highly intelligent animals and need both 
physical and mental stimulation on a daily basis. It's up to the owner to 
provide them with this. Having a well mannered, trained dog takes commitment. 
It is achieved by dedication, effort and love. The rewards the dog will give 
you in return are wonderful! So, you think you want to be a dog owner? Be fair 
to yourself and the dog, the kennels are full of unwanted dogs already, most of 
them are there because of broken commitments. Be more than an owner. Be a 
leader, protector, and provider. Don't let him or her down!</h5> 
<h5> Here are some responsibilities all future dog owners, and a reminder for 
all present dog owners should heed before making a commitment:</h5> 
<h5>1. Good quality food and water<br>
 2. Daily exercise (On-Lead walking) 
and training sessions<br>
 3. Rules to live by<br>
 4. Spay or neutering<br>
 
5. Safety: keeping corralled, leashed. Supervision, outside housing<br>
 6. 
Cleaning up after the dog, private or public<br>
 7. Neighbor friendly: 
barking, howling, crying etc.<br>
 8. Licensing<br>
 9. Health: annual 
checkups, attention to injury and sickness<br>
 10. Love and attention</h5> 
<h4>TOYS</h4> 
<h5>I like to put toys in three categories. The first are the supervised toys. 
These include all toys that can be chewed up, torn and swallowed. Included 
would be plush stuffed animals with or without squeekies, rawhides (I only like 
for a teething tool) light rubber, leather. These toys should only be allowed 
with your supervision. They need to be inspected often and thrown away when the 
risk gets to great.</h5> 
<h5>The second category is the unsupervised toys. These toys can be safely 
left with your pup or dog for lengths of time. Included would be Kongs, 
Nylabones. These toys can be left in the dog's crate with peace of mind. Of 
course all toys need to be size and hardness appropriate, as well as inspected 
for wear on a regular basis.</h5> 
<h5>The third categories are toys not for dogs. This is simple; anything that 
is not designed for dogs, like shoes, wood, tires, etc. You be surprised what 
people give their dogs to play with! These, &quot;toys&quot; of course should 
be avoided altogether.</h5> 
<h5>Below is a list of some toys I use and recommend:</h5> 
<h5>Kong Dog Toy &middot; Nylabone<br>
 Air Kong Dumbbell &middot; Kong 
Bounzer Dog Toy<br>
 Air Kong Sticks with Rope &middot; Kong Balls </h5> 
<h5>(NOTE: NON-DOG TENNIS BALLS ARE MADE WITH GLUE NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR 
DOGS).<br>

<h4>TO TRAIN OR NOT TO TRAIN</h4> 
<h5> Let's face it, if you own a dog, it's your obligation to care for it for 
its whole life. The obvious details include feeding, watering, letting out. If 
the dog is a little lucky it'll get leash walks, grooming, and love. If it's 
real fortunate, it'll get trained! We all live by rules in society, which is 
what keeps us civil. Well, dogs need rules to live by as well. Outside rules as 
well as inside rules. Without rules, a dog can develop behavior problems that 
it shouldn't be blamed for. I mean, if you don't establish rules, how will a 
dog know what's right and what's wrong? Little dogs are no exception. Don't let 
their size or &quot;cuteness&quot; deceive you! They still think like dogs and 
act like dogs. THEY ARE DOGS!</h5> 
<h5>As humans, we tend to put human emotions and qualities in our dogs, treat 
them like our children. Well, I love my dog and dogs in general as much or more 
than the next person. But, I still treat her like a dog! That doesn't mean my 
dog isn't treated well. I bet I can count on one hand how many times I didn't 
leash walk my dog in the fifteen years or so I had her! I feed her quality 
&quot;human grade&quot; dog food, she has appropriate toys, she is groomed, she 
goes to the vet annually (more if necessary), and most importantly, she is 
TRAINED! Because my dog knows right from wrong, she doesn't jump on people, 
annoy guests, stops barking when I command, certainly is housebroken, comes 
when I call her even when off-leash. Simply put an enjoyment for me to come 
home to everyday.</h5> 
<h5>Don't under estimate the intelligence of dogs; focus that intelligence 
through basic obedience training. It's the kindest thing you can do for your 
dog; trust me!</h5> 
<h4>TYPES OF OBEDIENCE TRAINING</h4> 
<h5>There are a few choices you can choose from when getting obedience 
training. I will describe and give my opinion of each of the programs. The most 
popular program is the group training class. This is where you bring your dog 
to a facility (sometimes a parking lot!) with a trainer and usually anywhere 
from six to twelve dogs. The problem with group training can be large classes 
and too many distractions. If the classes stay relatively small, maybe six 
dogs, and the instructor is good with people as well as dogs, obedience can be 
accomplished. Keeping the dogs focused is very important. This is not 
socialization time!</h5> 
<h5>Another type of training is the drop-off training. This is where you drop 
off your dog at the trainers' facility for a period of time for the dog to be 
trained (average two weeks for obedience.) The problem with this type of 
training is that the owner does not get trained! Unless there is a follow up 
program where the owner can learn the techniques, it's possible to undo 
everything the dog learned. Or worse, confuse the dog to a point of avoidance 
every time he's on a leash.</h5> 
<h5>The most effective method of obedience training is personal, one-on-one 
training, where the trainer comes to your house to train the dog, you, and your 
family! He also can show you how to correct any behavioral issues the dog was 
let to develop in the home as well. Instruction, not only on training, but also 
on the topic of behavior can be discussed to better give you an understanding 
of how the dog thinks and learns.</h5> 
<h5>Remember the stages of training.<br>
 1- The learning phase<br>
 2- The 
correction phase<br>
 3- The proofing (distraction) phase</h5> 
<h4>DOGS ARE PACK ANIMALS</h4> 
<h5>I would like to talk about pack, pack drive, and ranking within a pack. 
Dogs are pack animals, just like wolves are. If you ever watched a program on 
wolves, you will immediately recognize the pack behavior they display. The 
alpha pair are the two wolves that hold the highest rank and maintain rank 
among the rest of the pack mates. They submit to no one, and whom other pack 
mates defer. They eat first, drink first, etc.</h5> 
<h5>Well guess what, dogs are the same way, And you and your family are the 
pack! Some dogs have stronger pack drives than others, but most all has some 
pack drive. Pack drive is the instinct in the dog to be with their pack mates.
</h5> 
<h5>Ranking in the pack is where we as dog owners need to pay attention. I 
compare it to a totem pole. You are either above or below the dog. There is no 
&quot;even.&quot; Well, when you are seen as a higher rank, the dog will mind 
you. It's when you are seen as lower in rank, the dog develops the behavior 
problems we all see today: growling at the food bowl, barking for attention, 
pawing or nosing you for affection, excessive barking, stealing food. Need I go 
on? The way a dog grows in rank is when you let them sleep on the bed Lay on 
the furniture. Let them burst out the door Let them lead when coming in the 
door, constantly going to the dog to pet it, feeding it before you, or giving 
it table scraps from your hand Patrolling the back yard un-leashed.</h5> 
<h5>We grossly underestimate the pack drive of dogs, we spoil them, we don't 
discipline them, and we give in to them. Then we wonder why the dog barks (or 
bites) at all our visitors and every passer-by. This can all be avoided by 
making your dog earn everything in life. Make them sit (or down) before meals, 
before going out or in, or before affection. Obedience training is the best way 
to keep rank in pack. I'll let you and your spouse battle out whom number one 
and two is, but the dog needs to be below every family (pack) member! To quote 
behavioristCesar Millan, dogs need exercise, discipline, and affection. In that 
order. Respect dogs for what they are - dogs!</h5> 
<h4>DOG PARKS:</h4> 
<h5>So many of the dog owners that email me for help get so disappointed when 
I suggest they don't take their pups to dog parks. I don't even recommend 
taking adult dogs there either. When I talk about dog parks, or dog runs, I 
mean off-leash.</h5> 
<h5>The reasons for my feelings on dog parks are simple. Dogs are pack 
animals, and when you have more than two dogs together, you have a dog pack. As 
I stated in my article on pack drive and rank, we underestimate the pack drive 
of dogs. When these dogs are running together, they are establishing rank. Lots 
of time the dogs will work out their rank issues, but other times they will 
fight. If I'm the leader of my pack (my dogs) I am not going to let my dog 
settle ranking issues with other dogs, whether they are part of my pack or not. 
For every person who tells me they never experienced a fight in a dog park, I 
bet there are five who have.</h5> 
<h5>Puppies who experience a bite, pin or dominance from an adult dog will be 
affected for life! It can and will be dog aggressive forever. I wouldn't let my 
pup socialize with any strange adults. The Pup should only have positive 
experiences. By bonding with you and trusting you as a true leader, your dog 
will grow with confidence.</h5> 
<h5>Do your pup a favor, keep them away from strange adults, and keep your 
adult on a leash when around other dogs. Dogfights happen in a flash, and 
breaking up a fight between dogs unscathed isn't that easy. Prevention is the 
best medicine!</h5> 
<h4>THE &quot;EVIL&quot; CRATE</h4> 
<h5>I guess I need to write an article on crates and crate training. I'll 
never be able to convince everyone about the benefits of the crate, but at 
least they can read the facts.</h5> 
<h5>Every aspect of raising a pup can be simplified tenfold by using a crate. 
Housebreaking, being the foremost. Unless a pup was allowed to make mistakes in 
a crate, (which can happen when it is purchased from pet stores) they usually 
will not mess the crate up. Pet store workers either don't have the time, the 
dedication or don't care that dogs need to relieve themselves from time to 
time. Dogs, being creatures of habit can continue this when brought home. The 
other reason dogs dirty the crates (besides a medical condition) is because 
they can't hold themselves. Pups don't have the control once the brain tells 
them they have to go!</h5> 
<h5>The crates' primary use is for the unsupervised dog. Nobody wants to see a 
dog in a crate for 12 straight hours, but that's the situation the dog owners 
made for themselves knowing they work all day with no one home. That being the 
situation, the crate will keep the dog safe. I often hear the word 
&quot;cruel&quot; when talking about the crate. Well, I always say, why don't 
you ask the dog what cruel is. Is cruel putting a dog in a safe &quot;den&quot; 
or is cruel giving a dog free run of a home where he can display bad behaviors 
for you to constantly scold him (which by the way does nothing for teaching the 
dog). The poor dog winds up walking with his head down every time the owners 
come home regardless of whether or not he has done something wrong. Equally as 
bad is giving the dog the chance to ingest something that will make him sick or 
die.</h5> 
<h5>A crate does not cause separation anxiety. Dogs are pack animals, they 
always want to be with their pack so all dogs will be anxious about being 
alone! We must help them deal with it. Rescuing the barking dog. Too much 
hyper-activity in the house, only to be ended by putting the dog away when it 
has gotten out of hand. Never letting the dog deal with being alone hurts the 
dog dealing with separation.</h5> 
<h5>Keep playtime outside as much as possible. Put the dog in and out of the 
crate several times a day for different lengths of time. Feed the dog in the 
crate. Don't ever give in to a dog that cries in the crate. It will stop. If 
you have a young pup, you may have to get up at night to take it out, it may 
not be able to hold itself. If you do, go through your praise routine after the 
pup does his thing outside, then put him back in and go back to bed.</h5> 
<h5>Always take off collars when in the crate. Put only toys that the dog 
cannot tear and swallow. A special toy only for the crate like a Kong with a 
hole to put a treat in can keep the dog occupied longer. A good training or 
exercise session to relieve some energy and stress is a great idea before you 
put him in for a long period. Consider hiring a dog walker or sitter if you 
harbor guilt.</h5> 
<h5>Separate your emotions and trust me; the crate is by far the right thing 
to do. Remember that you took a dog in knowing that no one would be home to 
care for it during the day, don't compound things by setting it up for failure 
every day.</h5> 
<h5>The dog can certainly be weaned out of the crate during the day when he is 
entitled, and you will know when.</h5> 
<h4>PHASES OF DOG TRAINING</h4> 
<h5>By now you must have discovered the many different opinions on training 
dogs. From the &quot;old world&quot; trainers that learned the &quot;rock 'em 
sock 'em&quot; way, where dogs worked out of fear, to the completely 
&quot;positive&quot; trainers where the dog never receives discipline. Some 
clicker trainers usually stop short of discipline. You may hear from some that 
training with food will only be effective if you have food, or the dog loses 
focus on the training and focuses only on the food. Well, it can be true if you 
never continue the training into the correction phase.</h5> 
<h5> Where on this planet is there not a balance; &quot;on&quot;, 
&quot;off&quot; &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; &quot;black&quot;, 
&quot;white&quot; etc. Well, good complete dog training is a balance of praise 
and discipline. PRAISE IS SO IMPORTANT! We all are quick to discipline our 
dogs, but we are very short on praising the dogs when they do the right thing. 
ALWAYS end a negative (correction) with a positive (praise). This shows the dog 
the right from wrong and keeps his spirit and confidence in you, high. The 
three phases of training, as agreed by the top trainers of the world include 
the learning phase, the correction phase, and the proofing or distraction 
phase. When each of these phases are covered in training dogs, you will better 
communicate with the dog, thus giving them clear understanding of what we are 
expecting of them.</h5> 
<h5>The Learning Phase:<br>
 During the learning phase, dogs learn behaviors 
using only positive motivation and techniques. Your voice, treats, toys, and 
physical praise are effective tools when teaching dogs particular behaviors in 
the learning phase. Puppies fewer than five months old should only be trained 
positively. No corrections or stressful behaviors like long stays or 
&quot;heel&quot; should be taught at this time. When you are convinced the dog 
has learned and proved they know the behavior 110%, which should be practiced 
every day until five months of age, are they ready for the next phase of 
training.</h5> 
<h5>The Correction Phase:<br>
 Corrections include your voice, body language, 
or leash &quot;pops&quot;. In fact, your voice can be you best tool! At about 
five months of age, the dogs are now old enough to handle corrections. The food 
lures are phased out but the positive motivation of the training remains an 
important part in the correction phase.<br>
 When the dogs are displaying the 
correct behavior you must praise them lavishly. When they are not minding you 
(and they know the command 110%) you correct the dog with a firm &quot;no&quot; 
or with a simultaneous leash &quot;pop&quot;, followed by praise again at the 
right moment, thus ending a negative with a positive. Timing is crucial. If you 
train your dog every day, you will soon notice your corrections getting used 
less and less. Your praise should never diminish. When the dogs are performing 
the commands 110% they are ready for the next phase of training.</h5> 
<h5>The Proofing Phase:<br>
 When dogs are showing you that they know the 
commands taught to them, it is now time to bring them to other places and 
distractions. Dogs need to mind you where ever they are what ever the 
situation. If you only work a dog in your back yard, it may not perform as well 
at the park. Start with light distractions like noise, traffic, and even rain 
or snow, then increasing the distractions to crowds, wooded areas, other dog's 
etc.<br>
 Improvising the training sessions, keeping them short, interesting, 
different, and upbeat will polish the dog and keep his attention.<br>
 Good 
training includes leash technique, timing, voice intonation, a mix of praise 
and discipline, and an understanding of the particular dog that is being 
trained. They are all different, whether they are the same breed, same sex, or 
even from the same litter.</h5> 
<h4>CHOOSING THE RIGHT DOG</h4> 
<h5>So many breeds! So many rescues! So many lifestyles! How does one choose 
the right dog? Well, let's start by eliminating some reasons not to choose a 
particular breed, or dog.</h5> 
<h5>The reason not to get a dog:</h5> 
<h5>Can't commit to the responsibilities. Walking on a leash, rules to live 
by, schedules, quality time together for exercise, grooming and training. Some 
tiny dog owners seem to be more compromising than owners of larger dogs are. 
For some reason, tiny dog owners seem to feel neither exercise nor mental 
stimulation is necessary. They never go outside. They aren't walked and they're 
carried around like those Television Idiots do. They hardly get to be dogs.</h5>
<h5>The biggest reason NOT to choose a particular breed:</h5> 
<h5>MACHISMO!! Some men are to blame here. They choose the Bully's, Mastiffs, 
Dobie's, Rotti's etc. All great breeds. Bought for all the wrong reasons. These 
breeds need to be treated like any other breed. Respect, love, praise, 
discipline, but they are bought for intimidation, and used incorrectly for 
protection. Just because a breed looks like it will make good protection dog, 
doesn't always mean the particular dog you bought is suited for protection. 
Consider all the police K-9 dogs that don't have what it takes, and these dogs 
come mostly from good breeding programs.</h5> 
<h5>OK enough negativity. Lets talk about your choices. </h5> 
<h5>Age:</h5> 
<h5>Pup or adult? Puppies are great, they are cute and you get to bring them 
up your way. But, are you going to commit to the seemingly never ending 
attention and structure-building exercises it will take to raise your pup to 
adult hood? Adults can be a little easier; less demanding and best of all. 
Teething is over! Older people that are looking for a mellow companion may find 
a nice match with a mature dog that needs a home. The kennels have these dogs 
too.</h5> 
<h5>Size:</h5> 
<h5>Number one rule, you need to be able to physically handle your dog at all 
times, in any situation! Less than 1-% of dogs in this country are trained! If 
you can't handle your dog in an unexpected situation due to its size and 
strength you are putting yourself in grave danger. Then of course the dog 
doesn't get walked any more. Choose a dog that can be handled by you and your 
family.</h5> 
<h5>Coat:</h5> 
<h5>Nothing worse than a full coat dog that isn't groomed regularly or a 
poodle with eye stains due to neglect. If you're looking for a lower 
maintenance dog, consider a short coat breed or mix.</h5> 
<h5>Sex:</h5> 
<h5>Male or female? Males are generally larger, maybe more independent. 
Un-neutered males can drift. They can mark your home if not trained early. 
Un-spayed females come into season twice a year. Get you sponge mop ready! I 
don't have a great preference.</h5> 
<h5>Rescues:</h5> 
<h5>There is nothing nicer than bringing a dog into your home that has never 
known one, or possibly from an abusive situation. When rescuing a dog, please 
do all your homework. Lots of these dogs come with baggage. Insist on walking 
the dog while at the kennel. You can ask all the questions you want, and 
hopefully you will get answers from the shelter workers. My experience working 
with rescued dogs is that the truth is either not known or is not told to you. 
These dogs need structure. It makes no sense to spoil them because of there 
past. You still need to establish the rules, set the schedules and train the 
dog. Very shy or submissive dogs need an experienced owner, and a quiet home to 
rehabilitate, or at least make comfortable if at all possible.</h5> 
<h5>Specific breeds:</h5> 
<h5>This includes temperament. (The dogs outlook on life). Aloof, easygoing, 
docile, tough, aggressive etc. If you're not an outside person, or don't have 
access to land for exercising a dog, don't buy a dog that requires lots of 
&quot;run time&quot;. Some working breeds, herding breeds, and terriers come to 
mind. These dogs have to get rid of their energy; otherwise it turns into a 
bored and destructive dog inside the house. The Jack Russell Terrier always 
comes to my mind first. What a great breed! Full of energy and spirit. Great 
heart. Hell of a dog to control if you don't have the matching energy or time. 
These dogs need jobs! Carrying, searching, chasing (fetch).</h5> 
<h5>Terrier comes from the word TERRA. Not TERROR. We make dogs into terrors; 
meanwhile they have the heart of a lion! They are earth dogs, ground dogs, they 
like to chase small animals, and their noses are on the ground all the time. 
Why not harness that into a game of &quot;hide and seek&quot;. You can do this 
with the working dogs as well. After all, hide and seek is &quot;search and 
rescue&quot; to a small extent! Retrievers like to . well, figure that one out! 
We buy Golden's because of the &quot;A's &quot; on their overall report card as 
a great dog, but we forget that golden retrievers are RETRIEVERS!!!!!!!!!! They 
like swimming, fetching and finding. So happens they are generally great family 
dogs as well.</h5> 
<h5>Suppressing what comes naturally to a specific breed of dog only turns 
into stress and frustration for the dog. This inevitably surfaces as 
destruction or attention getting behaviors like excessive barking, bolting, 
peeing or pooping on the floor right in front of you!</h5> 
<h5>Bottom line when choosing a dog, analyze your own lifestyle, gather the 
family around the dinner table over a nice pizza, and get some input from all 
family members. Read as much as possible when you narrow down your choice. 
Newsgroups and forums are great places to ask questions. Explain the 
responsibilities to everyone. I love it when someone calls me to tell me they 
got a dog for their 5-year-old daughter! Always be prepared to do the job 
yourself. It will be the dog you are punishing, not your kids!</h5> 
<h5>The right dog will make a great addition to your family!</h5> 
<h4>TRAINING EXPECTATIONS</h4> 
<h5>The results you can expect after having your dog trained shouldn't be any 
different than training yourself for competition, keeping in shape, or 
preparing for a job assignment. It all takes practice! Sure, I can train your 
dog to understand certain behaviors like sit, down, come etc. but does than 
mean your dog can be off leash and come when called, or stay for extended 
periods after one 45 minute session? Well, the answer is most likely no. Some 
expectations I hear can be from - &quot;I want my dog to stay when I open the 
door&quot; to &quot;I want my dog to come when I call&quot; to &quot;I don't 
want my dog to jump on my guests.&quot; Perfectly common and certainly 
achievable behaviors when practiced.</h5> 
<h5>Dog-training goals need to be accomplished in steps. Perfecting step one 
before going to step two. For example, if your dog won't come on the long 
leash, he won't come off the leash! So, we perfect the recall on the leash 
first, then we progress to dropping the leash, adding distance, maybe a lighter 
line. Then maybe some random recalls while on the long leash and so on. Staying 
at the door starts with staying for you in general, then progressing to more 
distracting situations.</h5> 
<h5>How does the dog owner accomplish his goals? The same way goals are met 
for any aspect of goal achieving. Practice, repetition, consistency, Realistic 
goal setting.</h5> 
<h5>Training should include every day situations as well as &quot;formal&quot; 
practice sessions. Inside sessions as well as outside. After all, training your 
dog isn't about showing it off to family and friends. It's about getting 
results when you really need them! Your dog needs to work for you and your 
family, not just the trainer. There's only one way that's going to happen -<br>

 practice, practice, practice!</h5> 
<h4> DOGS AND KIDS<br>
 THE PERFECT MISMATCH</h4> 
<h5> Whenever there is a pup or adult dog under the same roof as children, we 
are inevitably going to have a conflict. All too many times the pup is going to 
nip, pull at pant legs etc. in turn the child is going to cry and the result 
they are going to be afraid. Of course we are going to yell at the pup! That's 
how pups play! They all have some degree of prey and play drive. They naturally 
chase things that move! Reprimanding the pup by yelling &quot;no&quot;, 
striking the pup, grabbing them, only confuses them and widens the bond you 
should be forming with them. The way we supervise our children, we should be 
supervising our pups. We only set the pup up to fail by allowing unsupervised 
play. There are ways children should play with our pups, and most all the time 
the child should have plenty of toys ready to throw. We need to have a toy 
between us and the pup. We are not the chew toy. We need to tell our children 
not to run around in the presence of the pup unless they are prepared to have 
the pup jump up on them. As adults, we need to be there to help the child get 
the pup off them and on to the toy. Games like fetch, hide and seek are great 
games to play. Children should not be allowed to pick the pup up, disturb them 
when eating or sleeping. Adult dogs may not have the same spirit as the pup, 
but my rule is simple. I never leave a dog alone with a child, especially a 
child that is not part of the family. I don't care if Lassie is your dog! Kids 
as well as adults do stupid things. One thing no one can predict is how a dog 
is going to react to a situation. We must respect our dog's space. No child (or 
adult) should be putting their face so close to a dog. They shouldn't be 
bothering a dog when it's sleeping or eating. We just don't know the state of 
the dog's mind at a particular moment, so why test it? Why do we insist on 
invading our dog's space? Strange kids, possibly when visiting your children 
should never be allowed to be left alone with the dog. Protect the dog; put him 
away if you can't supervise your child's play date. Some dogs tolerate lots of 
nonsense the child gives them. All dogs have a pain and fear tolerance. Dogs 
will defend themselves when they feel threatened, and blowing air in their face 
or sticking our face in theirs can be enough for the dog to be uncomfortable. 
Growling should be taken as communication that your dog is not comfortable. We 
must understand WHY the dog is growling and first prevent it, then get a game 
plan together with a professional and fix/manage it. Correcting a dog for 
growling can be dangerous. If a dog knows they are going to be corrected for 
growling, they very well may stop but does that make his state of mind any 
better? No. The dog can go directly to the bite! Please respect the dog and dog 
ownership; they are not windup toys that can be put away. Supervise them or put 
them away when in the presence of children or our adult guests. It's not the 
known aggressive dog that gets in trouble, we put them away. It's the dog that 
we all thought would never, in a million years bite anyone. Well guess what, we 
can't get in a dog's head. Any dog could bite if they are not comfortable with 
a given situation. Prevent the situation. Protect your dog!</h5> 
<h4> INNOTEK DOG TRAINING COLLARS</h4> 
<p>Some of my clients from my basic dog obedience training course want to move 
forward with their dog training and perhaps the most popular request is for 
&lsquo;off&rsquo; leash dog obedience training.</p> 
<p> The obvious and most common command is &ldquo;come&rdquo; and dogs quickly 
learn that when you have control (i.e. a collar and leash) they must submit. On 
the other hand, if a dog learns that sometimes there is no control, the dog 
will start to make its own decisions, which, as we know, is not always best for 
the dog.</p> 
<p><strong>Ask us about Innotek Dog Training Collars</strong></p> 
<h2>Innotek Dog Training &amp; Wireless Dog Containment</h2> 
<p>Innotek dog collars are electronic dog training collars that work quite 
well. E-collar training with Innotek dog collars is one of the most effective 
ways I know to &lsquo;off&rsquo; leash train your dog.</p> 
<p> When Innotek dog collars are used properly, it communicates to the dog 
that you still have control, even from a distance.</p> 
<p> When most dog owners think of e-collars they associate its use with dog 
containment using an invisible fence (in-ground fencing). This technology is 
very popular as well, and when the dog is trained correctly, it will rarely 
leave the property.</p> 
<p> Innotek dog collars are very versatile and serve both purposes;

<h4>LEASH TRAINING &amp; PUPPY OBEDIENCE TRAINING</h4> 
<p>Leash training a puppy, especially young puppies, should be limited to 
getting it used to being walked with you holding the leash.</p> 
<p><strong>Ask Us About Leash Training a Puppy</strong><strong> </strong></p> 
<h2>Leash Training Puppy Under 5 Months Old</h2> 
<p>For leash training a puppy under five months of age I always recommend a 
well fitted body harness rather than a neck collar. You can use a neck collar 
for the ID tags for now.</p> 
<p> I don&rsquo;t mind if a pup pulls on the leash at this stage. Heeling, or 
walking without pulling, is part of dog obedience training, which I like to 
start after the pup is at least five months old.<br>
 When leash training a 
puppy your pup may not want to move when the leash is on, so just let the leash 
go and let the pup run around and have fun while you keep him motivated using 
toys, balls, food etc.</p> 
<p> When the pup starts focusing on the fun distractions, pick up the end of 
the leash and run around with the pup letting the pup do the leading for now.
</p> 
<p>When leash training a puppy at this early age we only want the pup to get 
used to walking with the leash on. Pulling can be fixed in one lesson if the 
dog trainer knows how to teach the &ldquo;heel&rdquo; position.</p> 
<p> Remember, every experience in a young pup&rsquo;s life needs to be 
positive; people, places, things, etc. This is why the heel command is not part 
of the leash training just yet.</p> 
<p> Once the pup is walking with a bit more confidence you can start the 
socialization process by talking him through the neighborhood. Let the puppy 
stop to look, smell and hear all things in his world; this is what 
socialization is all about. Not just playing with other dogs.</p> 
<h2>Leash Training Puppy Over 5 Months Old</h2> 
<p>When a pup turns five months leash training can include the 
&ldquo;heel&rdquo; command however, this is best done by a professional dog 
trainer. For leash training a puppy at this stage, timing, the right collar 
correction and rewards are all crucial to successful teaching.</p> 
<p> A professional dog trainer can not only teach your dog the heel command, 
but can help you perfect the skills and timing needed to keep your dog clear on 
what is being asked of him as he&rsquo;s being leash trained.</p> 
<h2>Progressive Leash Training Strategies</h2> 
<p>Leash training a puppy should always start with little to no distractions. 
Then once your leash handling technique is good, and the dog is clear on the 
command, you can start taking your dog to more distracting places like the 
park, crowded streets, the kids soccer games, etc.</p> 
<p> Once the dog is clear on a command, there is no choice, they must obey. 
</p> 
<p>The leash training technique you learn with the heel command will be 
universal to alldog obedience training. As long as you continue to practice, 
and be consistent, the leash training will be long lasting.</p>

<h4>DOG TRAINING &amp; BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION</h4> 
<p>I receive many calls and emails from dog owners who want some form of dog 
behavior modification.</p> 
<p>From brand new puppies to adult dogs, everyone is looking to modify their 
dog&rsquo;s behavior for common issues likehow to stop dog barking, how to stop 
dog jumping and how to stop dog biting, plus growling, fighting etc.; even 
behaviors that are natural to a dog!</p> 
<p> I've seen behaviorists, veterinarians, etc., who have incorrectly 
approached dog behavior modification for many of these issues. Any time I 
interview a dog owner about a particular school or private session with a 
behaviorist they NEVER mention anything about dog training!</p> 
<p><strong>Ask Us About Dog Behavior Modification</strong></p> 
<h2>Dog Training Is Essential to Dog Behavior Modification</h2> 
<p>Dog training is an integral part of successful dog behavior modification.
</p> 
<p> First and foremost, if you are going to correct or modify any bad 
behaviors in a dog you must have the two most important things you need:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Control of your dog </li> 
<li>Respect from your dog</li> </ol> 
<p>Investing in professional dog training is highly recommended and not only 
teaches dog behavior modification but also teaches you how to apply the 
training to everyday situations (like the front door or food bowl).</p> 
<p> Dog training and dog behavior modification go hand in hand and will go a 
long way in helping you to have a long happy and healthy relationship with your 
dog.</p> 
<h2>Understanding Why Dogs Behave as they Do</h2> 
<p>When the rules are clear and followed through you will find that your dog 
is much easier to live with.</p> 
<p> It is important that dog owners understand WHY the dog is acting like it 
is.</p> 
<p> In most cases, issues like excessive barking can easily be kept under 
control by simply exercising your dog, putting your dog through daily training 
sessions and limiting your dog's freedom in the house.</p> 
<p> I understand that the average dog owner may not realize this, and 
hopefully this article will be of some value to them.</p> 
<h2>Positive Dog Behavior Modification</h2> 
<p>Here's a great example of positive dog behavior modification through 
correct dog training;<br>
 As a host you don't want your dog to jump on your 
guests so you want to somehow modify your dog's behavior. With proper dog 
training, this is as easy as it comes.</p> 
<p> There will be no need to correct your dog for jumping on your guests if 
you put your dog in a sit/stay! If the dog has been trained it can't possibly 
jump on your guests from a sit/stay. Problem solved.</p> 
<p> &quot;But what if my dog breaks the sit/stay?&quot; you may ask.</p> 
<p> Well, as long as you tell me the dog is clear with that command, he should 
be corrected for breaking your command; and this will be clear to the dog why 
he got a correction.</p> 
<p> Simulating and practicing the door routine is a must; doing these 
exercises in &quot;real time&quot; is simply not enough.</p> 
<h2>Serious Issues that Require Dog Behavior Modification</h2> 
<p>Occasionally there are some real issues that certainly need dog behavior 
modification. Some dogs will not get along with other dogs and some dogs growl 
around the food bowl for instance.</p> 
<p>These types of situations should really be observed by a professional dog 
trainer so that a proper game plan can possibly be worked out. In most cases, 
bad dog behavior will get a percentage better, although in some cases it will 
not.</p> 
<p> In any case, you will find that being proactive through professional dog 
training, plus removing certain triggers will soon control even these types of 
situations.</p> 
<p> If your dog growls when you try to take a rawhide or bone away, then no 
more rawhide or bones. We can't be negative with our dogs for everything. 
Eliminate certain things, train the dog and keep them well exercised and you 
will find your dog will behave in a much better way.</p>

<h4>THE BASICS OF HOUSEBREAKING A PUPPY</h4> 
<p>Housebreaking a puppy can be accomplished within two weeks if you follow 
the rules and dog training suggestions outlined below.</p> 
<p> To make housebreaking a puppy ten times easier, a crate should be used (see
Crate Training a Puppy). If you choose not to use a crate, then supervision is 
required ALL the time!</p> 
<p><strong>Ask Us About Housebreaking a Puppy</strong></p> 
<h2>Housebreaking a Puppy is 90% Vigilance, 10% dog! </h2> 
<p>When housebreaking a puppy the idea is to teach the dog where TO go, not 
only where NOT to go.</p> 
<p> Whenever a pup leaves the crate after having been crated (over night for 
instance), the puppy should go directly outside with a command like 
&quot;OUTSIDE.&quot;</p> 
<p> Once the puppy is outside, use a command like &quot;GO POTTY&quot; then, 
when the dog has FINISHED his business, praise and reward your puppy lavishly.
</p> 
<p> Keep the pup outside for a little while. Sometimes a puppy needs to go 
more than once, but more importantly pups like to be outside so we don&rsquo;t 
want the pup to associate going to the bathroom with the &quot;come back&quot; 
in (i.e. end of fun)!</p> 
<p> Once the pup has come back in, regardless of whether the pup did its 
business or not, the puppy either needs to go back in the crate or remain under 
someone&rsquo;s supervision.</p> 
<p> When housebreaking a puppy, it may make the occasional mistake. If you 
catch the puppy making a mistake, firmly say &quot;OUTSIDE&quot; and bring the 
pup outside, then repeat the first step few steps.</p> 
<p> If you don&rsquo;t catch your puppy making a mistake, don&rsquo;t bother 
scolding the dog, you didn&rsquo;t catch him in time and he cannot understand 
cause and effect.</p> 
<p> Avoid the temptation to believe &quot;He knows he did something 
wrong.&quot; He only knows your body language shows anger. Just realize that 
your puppy cannot be left unsupervised yet.</p> 
<p> Hitting your dog, or rubbing its nose in its stool, etc., does not teach 
your puppy right from wrong and is considered to be abuse!</p> 
<h2>Housebreaking a Puppy Using Papers</h2> 
<p>If you chose to use papers, then substitute the papers for outside. </p> 
<p> Spread the paper area around; make the target big enough for the dog to 
hit easier. You can eventually reduce the area slowly until it is just one pad.
</p> 
<p> I only recommend papers for small dogs, possibly in an apartment situation 
where you cannot get him outside quick enough. Remember, train today for what 
you want tomorrow!</p> 
<h2>Routine Helps When Housebreaking a Puppy</h2> 
<p>We must help our dogs succeed by putting them on a solid feeding schedule 
and exercise schedule plus, making sure that puppies are not in their crates 
too long. It is essential to get your puppy out in a timely manner. My saying 
is &quot;When in doubt, get them out!&quot;</p> 
<p> Reactive dog behavior modification methods simply don&rsquo;t work. Remain 
proactive and give your dog a fair shake. (SeeDog Behavior Modification)</p> 
<p> When housebreaking a puppy consistency is the key. Dogs learn by trial and 
error and repetition (which is worth repeating),<em>dogs learn by trial and 
error and repetition.</em></p> 
<p> We cannot afford to be inconsistent when housetraining a puppy. 
Inconstancies will only muddle the pup&rsquo;s understanding of what we want 
and make the housebreaking process much longer than it needs to be.</p>

<h4>TIPS ON HOW TO STOP DOG BARKING</h4> 
<p>Understanding when and why your dog barks can help you in dealing with how 
to stop dog barking.</p> 
<p> Barking is just one of the ways dogs communicate so the first question I 
have when people ask me how to stop dog barking is,<em>&quot;Why is the dog 
barking?&quot;</em></p> 
<p><strong>Ask Us About How to Stop Dog Barking</strong></p> 
<h2>Sometimes You Want Your Dog to Bark</h2> 
<p>Imagine disciplining your dog every time it barks in order to control his 
dog barking behavior and then coming face to face with a burglar who has 
entered your home or your property so easily?</p> 
<p> What if a bear wanders onto your property and you walk right out in front 
of it&hellip;because your dog has been disciplined not to bark?</p> 
<p> There are times when your dog should bark and times where you will want to 
know how to stop dog barking.</p> 
<p> What we need to determine is the difference between your dog&rsquo;s 
normal barking behavior and excessive or unnecessary barking; for instance, how 
to stop dog barking for attention, barking at everything that moves or barking 
when you prepare the dog&rsquo;s meal, etc.</p> 
<h2>Other Causes of Dog Barking</h2> 
<p>Some dogs are very reactive (this can be genetic) always reacting to the 
mailman, the kids in the neighborhood and so on. Most dogs remain like this 
because they are not trained!</p> 
<p> When we let our dogs out in a big fenced-in back yard and allow them to 
&quot;patrol&quot; all day long, the dogs will soon start making their own 
decisions about protecting our property (their territory). A fenced-in yard can 
be a real problem for dog barking behavior if you never spend time with your 
dog.</p> 
<p> When small dogs are spoiled by constantly being picked up, this can cause 
small dogs to bark. Why? Because they know that barking will get them what they 
want&hellip;picked up.</p> 
<p> Once a dog learns that barking will get them what they want, they will 
continue to bark. It&rsquo;s what they have learned to do. Dog barking can be 
very annoying and the dog will use that to its own advantage.</p> 
<h2>How to Stop Dog Barking 101 </h2> 
<p>First and foremost, how to stop dog barking most effectively is through dog 
obedience training. You must have control and respect from your dog; otherwise 
you cannot effectively manage your dog barking behavior issues.</p> 
<p> Listen to your dog. Try and understand the reason for your dog barking and 
manage that. Remember dogs are pack animals and consider you the leader of the 
pack, so they will listen to you if trained to do so properly.</p> 
<p> Here&rsquo;s an example: Your dog starts excessively barking out the 
window. Instead of yelling &quot;SHUT UP&quot; you go to where the barking is 
directed, recognize why your dog is barking and praise him for alerting the 
&quot;pack&quot; that there is an intruder and then put the dog in a command 
like sit and bring him away from the situation.</p> 
<p> Your dog will soon understand that once you have addressed the 
&quot;threat&quot;, his job is now done and you, as the pack leader, have taken 
over.</p> 
<p>How to stop dog barking is not an issue of dog behavior modification; this 
is a dog obedience training issue and pack issue. Remember, we teach dogs HOW 
to behave in a situation, not HOW NOT to behave so let&rsquo;s be proactive, 
not reactive.</p>

<h4>TIPS ON HOW TO STOP DOG BITING</h4> 
<p>You must keep your dog out of trouble. </p> 
<p>How to stop dog biting is a lot easier if your dog has had some dog 
obedience training, which should continually be reinforced.</p> 
<p> If not, I highly recommend you arrange to have some professional dog 
training for your dog. In learning how to stop dog biting, prevention is always 
your best course of action.</p> 
<p><strong>Ask Us About How to Stop Dog Biting</strong></p> 
<h2>How To Stop Dog Biting Through Dog Training</h2> 
<p>Dog obedience training is something you must continue to practice with your 
dog in order to gain and maintain your dog&rsquo;s respect, especially if your 
dog is biting. As long as you have control over your dog, and you supervise 
your dog properly, it cannot bite.</p> 
<p>Have a professional dog trainer evaluate your situation so that the right 
course of action can be taken. Management is always the first course of action.
</p> 
<p> The first thing a dog owner needs to distinguish when asking how to stop a 
dog biting; is it puppy nipping or a nasty dog that bites!</p> 
<p>Dogs do not have hands so they tend to be mouthy and some breeds are a lot 
mouthier than others. If you have a heeler or herding dog, expect the dog to 
use its mouth more. German Shepherds can be a mouthy breed as well.</p> 
<h2>How to Stop Puppy Dog from Biting or Nipping</h2> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with how to stop dog biting (or nipping) in puppies.</p> 
<p> All pups are going to nip. Fortunately, the best thing about young pups is 
that nipping and biting usually goes away.</p> 
<p>Dog obedience training is a must and should start as early as twelve weeks 
of age but there is no need fordog behavior modification. Biting and nipping 
can be alleviated faster with the proper dog obedience training.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not grab the dog&rsquo;s mouth</li> 
<li>Do not stick your fingers in your dog&rsquo;s mouth</li> 
<li>Do not hit your puppy</li> </ul> 
<p>These tactics cannot be called dog obedience training because they are very 
ineffective and certainly not how to stop dog biting&hellip;in pups or dogs. 
Besides, why go into conflict with your pup if you don&rsquo;t have to.</p> 
<p> Give some thought as to when your puppy starts nipping and then alter the 
way you play with your puppy. In fact the one thing I suggest is to redirect 
your puppy&rsquo;s dog biting behavior to a toy. Keep your puppy occupied and 
let it chase moving toys.</p> 
<p> In my experience I have found that nipping can be another sign that the 
pup needs to go to the bathroom. Use this sign to help signal you when to take 
your pup outside.</p> 
<p> Here are a few other suggestions to consider in how to stop dog biting if 
your pup will not stop nipping you or the kids;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Read my article about dogs and kids at www.dpdogtraining.com/articles.html
</li> 
<li>NO running around the house - make play outside and have lots of toys to 
throw around</li> 
<li>Supervise the pup around the children</li> 
<li>And lastly, put the pup in the crate, he very well could be over tired and 
may need a nap (seeCrate Training a Puppy)</li> </ul> 
<p>I offer a course on Foundation Building for dogs and a course on Positive 
Puppy Training; both courses are a great start, a preventative measure on how 
to stop dog biting.</p>

<h2><br>
 How to Stop Dog Biting In Grown Dogs</h2> 
<p>If your adult dog is biting, we will need a lot of information before 
determining how to stop dog biting.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Does your dog bite people?</li> 
<li>Does it bite other dogs?</li> 
<li>Is your dog unpredictable?</li> 
<li>Does your dog bite anything within sight? </li> </ul> 
<p>How to stop dog biting in adult dogs is best determined by experienced 
professional dog trainers/ behaviorists.</p> 
<p> Although some dogs are downright nasty (and some fearful) remember, you 
cannot use force on a biting dog (if at all), without knowing why the dog is 
biting.</p> 
<p> When using aggression to battle aggression you are really just playing 
with fire!</p>

<h4>TIPS ON HOW TO STOP DOG JUMPING</h4> 
<p>Just behind the &ldquo;dog pulling on the leash&rdquo; complaint, the 
second most populardog behavior modification request I get from potential 
clients is how to stop dog jumping.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;My dog jumps on everyone&rdquo; is a very common statement yet can 
be easily addressed with the properdog obedience training.</p> 
<p> The best way I know how to stop dog jumping is to use the 
&ldquo;sit&rdquo; command. If your dog has had the proper dog obedience 
training it should and will respond readily. It really is that simple.</p> 
<p><strong>Ask Us About How to Stop Dog Jumping</strong></p> 
<h2>Proper Dog Obedience Training is a Must</h2> 
<p>The real issue for most dog owners facing problems with how to stop dog 
jumping is the fact that their dog has never had any proper dog obedience 
training.</p> 
<p>In essence, dog behavior modification is really about dog obedience 
training, they both go hand in hand. How to stop dog jumping then becomes an 
issue of how to get your dog to understand your commands.</p> 
<p> When a dog has had too much freedom in the house and has never been told 
correctly how to act when people come over, your efforts to stop dog jumping 
will usually end in disappointment.</p> 
<h2>Basic Commands for Everyday Situations</h2> 
<p>Proper dog obedience training, when carried out effectively, will teach 
your dog basic, but yet very effective commands that you, the dog owner, can 
put to use for everyday situations.</p> 
<p> This really is a simple understanding issue, and your job here is to stop 
dog jumping by helping your dog understand your commands. Dog obedience 
training can be quite effective for any and all bad dog behaviors in the house.
</p> 
<p> If your dog is not obedience trained, chances are you do not have a line 
of communication open with your dog and simply put, your dog does not know what 
you want from him.</p> 
<p> Good dog obedience training takes practice so how can you expect to stop 
dog jumping and get your dog to obey your wishes and commands if your dog has 
never been taught properly and hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to practice?</p> 
<h2>Dogs In Command Can&rsquo;t Do Any Wrong </h2> 
<p>All dogs should earn their existence with you and should be able to execute 
a simple &ldquo;sit&rdquo;, or &ldquo;down&rdquo; before you give him anything; 
and that includes food, toys, treats, freedom etc.</p> 
<p> Once your dog knows what he needs to do, he will start doing it 
automatically and your efforts to stop dog jumping is no longer an issue.</p> 
<p>It is not a sin, and certainly recommended to put the dog on a leash (see 
Leash Training) when you know someone is coming to the house and practice the 
door routine. If you don&rsquo;t simulate the behavior you want, you will not 
succeed nearly as quickly.</p> 
<p> Think about this, if dogs are always in commands, they simply cannot do 
anything wrong!&nbsp;<br>
 For example; you are walking your dog on the street 
and someone wants to pet him and your first thought is how to stop the dog from 
jumping. You know the dog likes to jump up, so what do you do? Tell the dog to 
sit/stay.</p> 
<p>Now, if your dog breaks the command he either needs to be clear on the 
command (i.e. practice), or he needs to be corrected for breaking it. Leash 
corrections are best taught by aprofessional dog trainer. Read my article on 
the phases of dog training on myObedience Training Articles page. </p> 
<p> Either way, the right path to how to stop dog jumping and foster good dog 
behavior is through dog obedience training; by simulating &ldquo;real 
life&rdquo; situations, and then applying them to the real thing.</p> 
<p> How to stop dog jumping then (along with other dog behavior issues) is all 
about helping your dog understand your commands. Only correct your dog for not 
listening to commands you have taught him...do not correct for commands that 
your dog may be unsure or unclear about.</p>

<h4>THE BASICS OF CRATE TRAINING A PUPPY</h4> 
<p>Crate training a puppy is a must! </p> 
<p> Crate training provides your puppy with a safe place to den and sleep, 
helps with housebreaking, keeps your puppy out of trouble, reduces separation 
anxiety, plus has many more benefits for both you and your puppy.</p> 
<p> If your pup is being brought home for the first time, your crate should 
already be in place and ready for crate training your puppy.</p> 
<p> Depending on your dog&rsquo;s age and past history, your puppy should be 
able to adapt to a crate easily and will soon learn that his kennel crate is 
simply a part of life.</p> 
<p> If you follow these simple rules and suggestions for crate training a 
puppy it should take no more than few days for your puppy to accept its new 
crate.</p> 
<h2>Positive Crate Training &amp; Your Puppy </h2> 
<p>The first goal of crate training a puppy is to introduce the kennel crate 
in a positive manner.</p> 
<p> Dogs are naturally reluctant to soil where they sleep so crate training a 
puppy early can also help withhousebreaking your puppy.</p> 
<p> Dogs are den animals and in the end you want the crate to act like your 
puppy&rsquo;s den; a safe place, a place of refuge, therefore the crate should 
never be used as a form of punishment.</p> 
<p>Some dog owners use the crate as punishment or for dog behavior modification
. This rarely works as the timing is usually off and therefore fails to teach 
the puppy right from wrong; instead the puppy learns to fear and resent the 
crate.</p> 
<p> Be patient when crate training a puppy; train today and train positively, 
for what you expect tomorrow and your puppy will be happy to run to the crate 
whenever you ask.</p> 
<h2>Collars, Toys &amp; Food When Crate Training a Puppy</h2> 
<p>I do not like using collars when crate training a puppy and recommend 
removing your puppy&rsquo;s collar before crating. A kennel crate is a place of 
confinement and dog collars may be unsafe for your pup.</p> 
<p> Any positive association with the crate will expedite the puppy&rsquo;s 
acceptance when crate training. Putting inedible toys in your puppy&rsquo;s 
crate is okay but the puppy toys MUST be ones that cannot be chewed and 
swallowed. Nylabones&reg; and Kong&rsquo;s&reg; chew toys are nice choices.</p> 
<p> If you want to put a dog bed in the crate, I recommend giving the pup one 
chance. If the pup chews the dog bed, out it comes. I am also a big fan of 
feeding my pups in the crate however I do not leave water or uneaten food in 
the crate.</p> 
<h2>Where to Place Your Puppy Crate</h2> 
<p>Crate training older dogs can take a lot longer as old habits die hard, 
however crate training a puppy should be a lot easier.</p> 
<p> The dog crate should be located in a place in the home where you spend 
most of your time. The bedroom is not always the best choice if you want to 
avoid the pup getting up every time you toss and turn or you waking up to an 
unnerving bark at three in the morning when you are fast asleep.</p> 
<p> You might think about a second crate especially if your home has more than 
one level.</p> 
<h2>Be Patient When Crate Train A Puppy</h2> 
<p>The golden rule is, when the pup cannot be supervised put it in the crate. 
Remember, when you leave the house you must feel comfortable knowing your puppy 
cannot get into any trouble.</p> 
<p> Here are some general guidelines for crate training a puppy:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Start crate training a puppy by putting the pup in and out of the crate 
several times a day for different lengths of time.</li> 
<li>Play with the pup in front of the crate with the door open. </li> 
<li>Allow the pup to freely enter and exit the crate several times. </li> 
<li>You can toss treats into the crate but not too much. </li> 
<li>Use chew toys and a lot of enthusiastic praise every time he goes in and 
out of the crate.</li> 
<li>At some point you will need to close the crate door with your puppy inside
</li> 
<li>In the beginning, open the crate door after a short amount of time but 
NEVER when the pup is barking.</li> 
<li>When you feel confident your puppy has accepted his new crate, it is time 
to close the crate door and for you to leave the house; be sure to leave with 
no fanfare or good byes, just leave.</li> 
<li>Hang out outside and monitor your puppy in the crate.</li> 
<li>If the pup starts barking, leave him be.</li> 
<li>Enter only when the pup settles down.</li> 
<li>Apply these same rules at night. </li> </ul> 
<p>Only go get the puppy from his crate if the puppy starts up in the middle 
of the night, he most likely has to go out. Remember - don&rsquo;t rescue your 
puppy if he starts barking from the start as that will only reinforce his 
barking behavior.</p>

<h4>DOG CONTAINMENT USING AN INVISIBLE FENCE</h4> 
<p>Having a fenced in back yard has many advantages to us as dog owners. The 
biggest advantage is dog containment without tethers for the dog.</p> 
<p> Of course there are pitfalls as well; digging, dirty lawns and the lack of 
(or no) training or walks for the dog. Your &lsquo;fenced in&rsquo; dog can 
become quite territorial if it remains unattended for long periods of time.</p> 
<h2>Dog Containment Should Not Replace Dog Training </h2> 
<p>A fenced-in yard or property no doubt is an excellent advantage for all 
dogs and dog owners if the fenced yard is used as dog containment to complement 
instead of as a substitute for, quality dog training and walking time with your 
dog.</p> 
<h2>Underground Electric Dog Fences </h2> 
<p>Dog containment may become an issue for some home owners who either cannot 
put up a physical fence due to the municipalities of their towns, or the dog 
owner feels a fence would ruin the look of their home and neighborhood.</p> 
<p> A popular and growing choice for dog owners these days is dog containment 
using an invisible fence such as theInnotek underground electric dog fence 
system.</p> 
<p>The Innotek dog containment system is basically an electric dog fence with 
a buried wire placed around the property line and used in conjunction with a 
special electric dog training collar, which the dog wears around his</p> 
<p> The invisible fence dog collar helps to train the dog so it learns where 
the property boundaries are, keeping the dog in the yard.</p> 
<p><strong>Ask us about the Innotek Underground Electric Dog Fence</strong></p>
<h2>Layout of Underground Dog Fence</h2> 
<p>Dog containment using an invisible fence can be as simple as;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A single loop around the whole property</li> 
<li>A loop around just the back yard</li> 
<li>Or a loop around just the front yard</li> </ul> 
<p>The dog containment system can also be used to box out dog-free zones like 
swimming pools; children play areas, landscaping, gardens etc.</p> 
<h2>Installing an Invisible Dog Fence</h2> 
<p>There are many choices on the market these days for dog containment using 
an invisible fence. Some people prefer the do-it-yourself (DIY) electric dog 
fence system and you can certainly try to tackle the installation yourself (the 
wire should be buried).</p> 
<p> Dog containment systems using invisible fence, underground fence, hidden 
fence and such are not difficult to install and can also be installed easily by 
landscapers or fence installers.</p> 
<p> This is no problem for the installation phase but when it comes to 
training your dog, I would always recommend an experienced dog trainer that can 
recognize your dog&rsquo;s basic character and temperament and train 
accordingly.</p> 
<p> A qualified dog trainer, who not only has experience in how to install an 
underground dog fence but is accomplished at electric dog fence training, will 
be able to properly train both you and your dog in use of your new underground 
electric dog fence system to ensure continued success.</p> 
<p> The electric fence dog training is crucial! The steps must be followed 
properly and patience during the first few weeks is a must. You cannot 
compromise the training period if you want your dog to reliably stay on the 
property.</p> 
<h2>Dog Containment Won&rsquo;t Keep Other Dogs Out&nbsp; </h2> 
<p>Remember, although dog containment using an invisible fence will keep your 
dog on the property, it is not designed to keep other animals or people 
&lsquo;off&rsquo; your property.</p> 
<p> Never use the dog containment system as an excuse to leave your dog 
unattended for extended periods of time. You risk having your dog get into 
fights or worse, they may get stolen. Unattended dogs also tend to quickly 
develop bad habits and poor decision making.</p>

<h4>DOG OBEDIENCE TRAINING</h4> 
<p>The pet industry in this country continues to grow by millions of dollars 
every year. In fact by 2010 pet spending is expected to top $50 billion in the 
US!</p> 
<p> How much of this would you expect goes towards dog obedience training?</p> 
<p> As Americans, we spend tons of money on our pets every day; from food, 
treats and toys to clothes and services, like dog walking. We even hire people 
to clean the dog droppings from our yards!</p> 
<h2>Less Than 1% of US Dogs Get Any Formal Dog Obedience Training</h2> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad truth.</p> 
<p> Billions are spent on dog care each year for the (estimated) 60 million 
dogs in this county, yet less than one percent of these dogs get any formal dog 
obedience training! That&rsquo;s appalling!</p> 
<p> The majority of complaints that dog owners have about bad dog behavior 
could easily be rectified with the proper dog obedience training.</p> 
<h2>Dog Behavior Modification that Works!</h2> 
<p>Instead of investing a few dollars up front for good dog obedience 
training, most dog owners tend to approach dog behavior modification with quick 
fixes that simply don&rsquo;t work.</p> 
<p> They buy chew toys that last for literally hours, they tie out their dogs 
in the back yard or they crate their dogs for far too long.</p> 
<p> These dog owners will do anything to circumvent the bad dog behavior but 
only if they can keep themselves less involved. One wonders why they even own 
dogs.</p> 
<p> This type of dog owner complains all the time, asking the same questions:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>How do I stop dog barking?</li> 
<li>How do I stop dog jumping?</li> 
<li>How do I stop dog biting?</li> 
<li>How can I housetrain my dog?</li> 
<li>How can I stop my dog from running away?</li> </ul> 
<p>If your dog chews, destroys everything, never listens or runs away, dog 
behavior modification is usually a lot easier and much more permanent with the 
proper<strong>dog obedience training</strong>.</p> 
<p> The truth is&hellip;you have to spend more time with your dog and invest 
some of your dog care money on proper dog obedience training. In the long run, 
it will save you literally hundreds of dollars and a lot of aggravation over 
the coming years.</p> 
<p> My advice&hellip;don&rsquo;t waste your money on toys, treats and quick 
fixes&hellip;invest in dog obedience training.</p> 
<h2>Pro-Active Dog Obedience Training</h2> 
<p>Invest in good dog obedience training and not only will you have a better 
dog and companion, but you&rsquo;ll rediscover the joy of why you got a dog in 
the first place (the &ldquo;saving money in the long run&rdquo; is really just 
an added benefit).</p> 
<p> In all my years teaching dog obedience training as a means of good dog 
behavior modification, I&rsquo;m happy to say that the dogs and their owners 
are still together&hellip;and having a much easier time of it.</p> 
<p> My proactive dog training methods and every day situational training 
exercises result in civil, calm, well behaved dogs who exhibit good manners 
around guests.</p> 
<p> When your dog has good dog obedience training, you will find that any 
prior dog behavior modification issues you thought your dog once needed will 
now simply fall away!</p> 
<h2>Professional Dog Training Services</h2> 
<p>My professional dog training services include dog obedience training in New 
York and dog obedience training in New Jersey.</p>

<h4>ELECTRIC DOG FENCE</h4> 
<p>DP Dog Training services dog owners in New York and New Jersey areas and 
more and more we see dog owners opting for the electric dog fence instead of 
erecting a physical fence fordog containment.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Ask Us About Purchasing &amp; Installing the Electric Dog 
Fence</strong></p> 
<p> Some Jersey and New York municipalities will not permit fencing over a 
certain height. Some owner&rsquo;s simply don&rsquo;t want a fence. And then 
again, some properties just don&rsquo;t look good with a physical fence on it.
</p> 
<p> The electric dog fence is a great solution for dog containment and is 
commonly referred to by several other names including:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> Invisible Dog Fence<br>
 Hidden Dog Fence<br>
 Underground Dog Fence <br>
 
Wireless dog containment<em>(in reference to the invisible fence dog collar)
</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p> The electric dog fence is basically a wire buried underground that creates 
a field or dog containment area, that when used with the receiver on dog 
training collars (Innotek dog collars or e-collars) warns the dog with a tone 
that the area&rsquo;s boundary he is approaching is not permissible.</p> 
<p> As the dog attempts to leave this dog containment area, he will be 
stimulated by the dog training collar until he retreats.</p> 
<h2>Electric Dog Fence Stimulation is Temporary</h2> 
<p>When trained properly with the electric dog fence most dogs wearing dog 
training collars only receive two to four stimulations&hellip;and that&rsquo;s 
it, that&rsquo;s all that is ever needed.</p> 
<p> If you are nervous about using an electric dog fence, remember one thing - 
stimulation with dog training collars is quick and temporary whereas a lost or 
killed dog is permanent!</p> 
<p> Dog containment using an invisible fence is one of the safest and most 
effective methods I know of.</p> 
<h2>Installing Electric Dog Fence</h2> 
<p>The underground electric dog fence wire must be laid out in such a manner 
that it creates a loop (closed circuit).</p> 
<p> From the loop a twisted wire is then attached and brought to the house 
where it is connected to the electric dog fence unit that is powered by an 
outlet. The twisted wire will allow the dog to cross without correction while 
wearing the dog training collar.</p> 
<p> The electric dog fence loop can be customized by boxing out things like 
swimming pools, gardens, kid's play areas and even landscaping.</p> 
<h2>The Importance of Proper Dog Training</h2> 
<p>The importance of properly training your dog using dog training collars and 
the electric dog fence cannot be understated.</p> 
<p> The dog <strong>MUST</strong> learn that retreating to the safe areas is 
the only way to stop stimulation from the dog training collar. This is best 
achieved by keeping your dog on a long leash line during the first two weeks of 
training.</p> 
<p> The dog must never cross out of the dog containment area and never 
discover that crossing the boundary will also stop the stimulation.</p> 
<p> Start by positioning flags on the perimeter of the dog containment 
boundary where the dog will get the warning tone.</p> 
<p> After the dog starts to get used to his safe area and cannot be enticed 
beyond the dog containment boundary the flags can start coming down slowly 
until they are all down.</p> 
<p> You must then start with more distractions to proof the dog. Remember, 
this electric dog fence will not keep other dogs or animals off the property.
</p> 
<h2>Treat the Electric Dog Fence Like It Is A Real Fence</h2> 
<p>Perhaps the biggest issue many dog owners have with the electric dog fence 
is how to get the dog off the property for walks!</p> 
<p> There are several simple solutions to this problem. First remove the dog 
training collar and then use your car to drive your dog past the dog 
containment area. From there you can continue walking your dog.</p> 
<p> Another solution (after removing the dog training collar) is to use 
traffic cones to create a &ldquo;door&rdquo; and couple this with a command 
like &ldquo;with me&rdquo; so that the dog understands he can leave the dog 
containment area only through this door&hellip;and only when accompanied by you.
</p> 
<p> The dog will soon comprehend that when the cones are removed, the door is 
&ldquo;closed&rdquo; and he cannot leave the dog containment area.</p> 
<p> Even though the underground electric dog fence is &ldquo;invisible&rdquo;, 
it should be treated as if it were a real physical fence. At no time and under 
no circumstances should your dog be allowed to cross the dog containment 
boundary, even without the dog training collar, otherwise your dog will become 
confused.</p> 
<p> When used properly with the proper training, an electric dog fence is a 
great dog containment solution.</p>
