<p>Today is UNESCO&rsquo;s International Mother Language Day! We spoke with 
Pi&ntilde;a Madera* and Lisa Locklin**, two fabulous instructors who offer 
classes at our Concord Studio, to learn why children should learn a foreign 
language. Please read on for our Q &amp; A with Pi&ntilde;a and Lisa, and come 
back next week for part two!</p> 
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Why do you think it is important to expose 
children to foreign languages?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Pi&ntilde;a:</strong> There are so many good reasons to give kids a 
jump-start on learning multiple languages. Here are just a few:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It helps with language and literacy overall.</li> 
<li>It exposes them to the notion that there are other places where people 
speak different languages (and as they get older you can naturally introduce 
new customs), and this opens their mind to things that are different, preparing 
them for a global reality.</li> 
<li>It allows them to communicate with people they would otherwise never meet.
</li> 
<li>It increases their future career prospects.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> A second language enriches and enhances a 
child&rsquo;s mental development, and it has a positive effect on intellectual 
growth. It also leaves students with more flexibility in thinking, a greater 
sensitivity to language and culture, and a better ear for listening. Studies 
consistently show, for example, that students who are multilingual perform 
better on standardized tests.</p> 
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What are the benefits of introducing children 
to foreign languages at an early age as opposed to later in life?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Pi&ntilde;a:</strong> Research has shown that it is actually good 
for the brain&mdash;improving test-taking, handling distraction, math, music 
and even delaying Alzheimer&rsquo;s for truly fluent bilinguals</p> 
<p>The young brain is uniquely prepared to learn language in the early years. 
We traditionally introduce languages at the onset of puberty, when we are 
distracted, highly self-conscious, and risk-averse. Young children are not 
inhibited about making mistakes, or mispronouncing words, or sounding silly. 
Teens are. You will be sparing your future teen many embarrassing moments and 
arduous memorization if you teach them now.</p> 
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Children&rsquo;s brains are more &ldquo;open&rdquo; 
when younger&mdash;they absorb things more quickly. A second language can bring 
them more confidence. And younger children can adopt a &ldquo;native-like 
accent&rdquo; better than older children. Children understand intuitively that 
language is something to explore, have fun with and enjoy.</p> 
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>In your experience, what is the best way to get 
a child excited about learning a new language?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Pi&ntilde;a:</strong> We have found that giving children language 
they can use, and conducting their favorite activities in the second language 
makes for an easy, satisfying transition. Music and silliness is always a great 
add when teaching kids anything. Incorporate tickling, if possible!</p> 
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> By having fun with books, songs, games, attending 
multicultural events and role-playing.&nbsp; One of my favorite learning games 
is making a passport and &ldquo;flying&rdquo; to Paris for a visit.</p> 
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What do you think is the hardest part of 
mastering a new language?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Pi&ntilde;a: </strong>Finding a community to practice with can be 
hard, but worth the hard work. A community can inspire, encourage and help with 
what is a slow process.</p> 
<p>Know, too, that kids develop language through relationships with a loving 
caregiver&hellip;not through videos and apps. It&rsquo;s great to add media as 
a support, but studies show that language is learned from loving caregivers 
much more effectively than from media.</p> 
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> For adults, an authentic accent becomes harder and 
harder as you age, and the nuance of humor is a very difficult aspect of 
learning a new language. But for a child, a foreign accent and joking is easy. 
For the youngest children, the hardest part of learning a language is not about 
the language, but about their ability to listen and focus on the class, and to 
participate.</p>
