<p>We are all suffering from the realities of the Ecomomic Downturn and we as 
parents need to stop and figure out what is really important.</p> 
<p>This is an Opportunity to access and really decide what is the &ldquo;Main 
Thing&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>This can be a time where our kids get forgotten &ndash;or&ndash; actually 
the focus of our lives in a new and compelling way!</p> 
<p>When is the last time you took that Bike Ride or Camping Trip&ndash; so 
long a focus of your kids bugging you?</p> 
<p>Worse yet, have they given up bugging and nagging you knowing it goes 
nowhere?</p> 
<p>NOW is the time to take that trip, go for that ride, or go and jump on the 
trampoline&hellip;</p> 
<p>Here are some ideas to break the paradigm, the lethargy, and the 
rut&hellip;now and forever.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>5 Tools for Effective Families: Introduction</strong></p> 
<p>What is it that we as parents want to leave with our kids after we&rsquo;re 
gone?</p> 
<p>What will be our <strong>legacy and heritage</strong>?</p> 
<p>Like Curly in the movie &ldquo;City Slickers&rdquo; asks: &ldquo;<strong>
What is that One Thing?</strong>&ldquo;-That thing that defines and motivates 
your life?</p> 
<p>What will they say about you after you are gone?&hellip;and we all will be 
someday!</p> 
<p><strong>Why</strong> do we do what we do when it comes to our parenting?</p>
<p>Why is <strong>Intentional Parenting</strong> so important, vital and a key 
priority?</p> 
<p>In the &ldquo;<strong>5 Tools for Effective Families</strong> &ldquo;we 
will explore how to nurture our kids by setting a foundation of best practices.
</p> 
<p>We will learn to incrementally introduce the habits and tools to parent 
intentionally.</p> 
<p>Our goal should be to nurture our children and help them flourish: to be 
the best they can be.</p> 
<p>We will explore listening, good communication, genuine encouragement, 
choosing to give grace, and laying a foundation of faith in God that governs 
all of whom we are and where we are going as a family.</p> 
<p>It all begins with <strong>relationship building</strong> on a quality life 
foundation that results in emotional health and well-being of our families.</p> 
<p>The end goal is that we may be able to leave a legacy and heritage for our 
children and their children as well.</p> 
<h2>5 Tools for Efffective Families: #1, Listening</h2> 
<p>Communication has two parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Listening and</li> 
<li>Expressing yourself</li> </ul> 
<p>Both must occur for communication to be successful.</p> 
<p>Listening&hellip;</p> 
<p>When you listen well to family members, you encourage them to talk about 
what&rsquo;s most important to them. It&rsquo;s easy to get careless about 
really listening, but listening is at least as important as talking. Everyone 
needs someone to listen to them, someone who supports them and allows them to 
openly express feelings. Sometimes a person can find a solution or discover the 
sources of stress just by talking. Some of us process our feelings or find ways 
to clarify and express our thoughts by simply talking to others. Find out which 
of your family members process in this way and you will have a key to unlocking 
their &ldquo;code&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Dads sometimes feel obligated to lecture, present solutions, and give an 
analysis instead of listening. This is not good listening. A good listener 
should not feel obligated to advise, analyze, or have all the answers. 
Listening and responding with concern and understanding may be all the help 
needed. And remember, it&rsquo;s hard to listen well when strong emotions are 
in the way.</p> 
<p>Effective listening encompasses the following:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Attentiveness. Paying attention and putting aside what you are doing shows 
the speaker that you intend to listen. The harder part of attentiveness is 
putting aside your opinions and thoughts and conclusions until you&rsquo;ve 
really heard what the speaker is trying to say.</li> 
<li>An attitude of openness and respect. You may not agree with what your 
family member&rsquo;s saying, but being willing to hear and listen indicates 
respect and honor.</li> 
<li>Clarifying meaning. Check out the interpretation of the message you are 
getting. Feedback helps to know whether you&rsquo;ve understood what your 
family member means. Give feedback or check your interpretation of what is 
being said.</li> 
<li>A validating response. This lets the other person know you are ready for 
more listening. This involves body language, posture, facial expressions, and 
genuinely showing readiness for more communication</li> </ol> 
<p>Dads tend to be natural lecturers. All of us need to work to be more 
intentional listeners. I&rsquo;ve found many times that listening sets the 
stage for solving problems, great relationships, and genuine peace in our 
family. Practice just sitting and focusing on your child without any 
distractions, and it will transform your life, their life, and your 
relationship together.</p> 
<h2>5 Tools for Effective Families: #1, Listening, Part Two</h2> 
<p>The art of listening.</p> 
<p>One of a human&rsquo;s greatest needs is psychological survival, to be 
understood, affirmed, validated, and appreciated.</p> 
<p>In other words, we need to be heard. It isn&rsquo;t always easy, and we 
live in a busy world, and many of us spend our days in a time crunch.</p> 
<p>But the experts agree, when we take time to listen we improve 
relationships, promote an atmosphere of cooperation and encourage creative 
thinking, and even save money by avoiding costly errors caused by 
miscommunication.</p> 
<p>Active listening does not come naturally. Stephen Covey notes that when 
someone speaks, our initial reaction is to evaluate and scrutinize them, the 
opposite of what we should do.</p> 
<p>Instead, we should focus on empathetic listening with the intent to 
understand and we must do this with the goal of helping.</p> 
<p>There are four phases of empathetic listening, according to Covey.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The first is to mimic content, repeating exactly what the speaker has said
</li> 
<li>The second stage is to rephrase the content to what was said in our own 
words</li> 
<li>Third, you may reflect feelings or make a non-judgmental statement about 
the speaker&rsquo;s emotions, empathizing with what or how he feels.</li> 
<li>The fourth stage is a combination of the second and third stages, to 
rephrase content and reflect feelings.</li> </ol> 
<p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to hear what&rsquo;s being said, choosing to 
be annoyed instead of understanding the other person&rsquo;s view. This only 
damages a relationship. We&rsquo;d make a better choice of moving forward, 
forgiving the offense and the offender, and resolving the problem.</p> 
<h2>Listening must come from the hearer. If it is not sincere it will show 
regardless of what you say. Nonverbal gestures will expose true feelings. When 
this happens, make it a point to remain focused on what the speaker is saying, 
actively participating in and practicing the stages of empathetic listening. 
The art of listening lies in understanding that to be an effective father, 
leader, spouse, or any other role we must not only care about what others have 
to say, but also how they feel. Just remember your kids need your full 
attention, your patience, and a listening ear, so listen well when they speak. 
It will make you an even better father than you already are.</h2> 
<p><strong>5 Tools for Effective Families: #2, Expressing Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Expressing yourself&hellip;</p> 
<p>You may assume other family members know your needs, feelings, and opinions 
without you telling them.</p> 
<p>But relying on mind reading may result in:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Disappointment</li> 
<li>Frustration</li> 
<li>Resentment</li> 
<li>Loneliness or hurt</li> </ul> 
<p>Here are some guidelines for expressing yourself clearly.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Describe your feelings. Share your feelings with&rdquo; I&rdquo; 
statements. They build trust and relationships and they give you ownership of 
what&rsquo;s being said:&rdquo; I feel-______&rdquo;</li> </ol> 
<p>Say what you mean in a simple, direct way. I&rsquo;ve found that honesty is 
always the best policy. People seem to resonate with honesty and being straight 
up with them. Be specific, rather than general. Resist the temptation to be a 
pleaser, always trying to tell people what you think they want to hear. This is 
a big mistake.</p> 
<p>Here are some tips to use.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Describe how other people&rsquo;s behavior affects you without blaming. 
&rdquo; You&rdquo; statements can stifle communication and create an accusatory 
atmosphere.</li> 
<li>Be aware of your nonverbal communication. Your body language gives you 
away every time. Be attentive to your face, tone of voice, and body language, 
because they communicate far more than your words.</li> 
<li>Find the time. Perhaps the most important way to express yourself is to 
make time to communicate with your family. Making a conscious effort to carve 
out time to talk with each individual, and together as a family, is key to the 
relational health of your family. A family environment can provide a safe place 
for its members to share feelings, thoughts, ideas, theories, dreams, and hopes.
</li> </ol> 
<p>It is often family that is left out. During busy, hectic times, it&rsquo;s 
especially important to plan a few minutes when everyone can be together, or 
when you can be alone with a family member without interruption. Be sure to 
save a difficult problem-solving conversation for times when you&rsquo;re not 
totally tired or fatigued.</p> 
<p>Many of us are verbal learners and need to process our issues and problems 
through talking. If you have kids or a spouse who is thusly wired, you would do 
well in heeding the advice above. People who learned this at a young age will 
be more likely to cope well with stress as adults. Being able to discuss and 
vent angry feelings can keep those feelings from creating more severe problems 
such as alcohol or drug abuse, violence, stress, depression, or other emotional 
problems.</p> 
<p>Take the time and make the time to communicate today. This is an investment 
in your children that far outweighs money or possessions.</p> 
<p>If not you, who?</p> 
<p>If not now, when?</p> 
<h2> </h2> 
<h2>5 Tools for Effective Families: #3, Encouragement</h2> 
<p>Mastering the Art of Encouragement.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how everyone needs encouragement, but is so reluctant to 
give it.</p> 
<p>It costs so little to give, but can yield such high dividends. We cannot 
afford to overlook this key life habit.</p> 
<p>The investment of encouragement can truly build up ourselves, our kids, our 
spouses, and our communities.</p> 
<p>Encouragement needs to be:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Intentional. Offering encouragement takes extra effort and does not happen 
accidentally. We must be intentional if we are to be lifelong encouragers. This 
will mean having eyes to spot people doing things right, especially our 
children. To catch them doing something right and speak a word of encouragement 
is a powerful tool.</li> 
<li>Empathetic. Be especially attentive to the needs of your kids. What would 
it feel like if you were a child in the midst of embarrassment, disappointment, 
or discouragement? Think about how you would feel. Were you that child? Did 
someone encourage you? If so, great! If not, how can you make a difference by 
being an encouragement to both your kids and those around you in your world?
</li> 
<li>Specific. Don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;good job&rdquo;, but rather provide 
details and specifics; showing someone that you&rsquo;re paying attention can 
be encouraging in and of itself. Offer suggestions and remember that 
constructive criticism, couched in a spirit of encouragement, can be inspiring 
as a complement.</li> 
<li>Sincere. The word &ldquo;sincere&rdquo; is from the Greek meaning 
&ldquo;without filler&rdquo;. Encouragement must not be unmerited praise or 
flattery. Do not exaggerate a person&rsquo;s competence, achievements, or 
potential. Being believable, authentic, transparent, and genuine will help you 
build trust.</li> 
<li>Prompt. Respond with encouragement as soon as possible and preferably 
face-to-face. Making positive comments publicly compounds the positive affect 
of encouragement. Some people would rather see it in writing, so jot them a 
note or an e-mail. These can be public as well.</li> 
<li>Thorough. Following up by writing a detailed letter with encouraging 
content can really uplift your children. E-mail is suitable for doing this as 
well, as kids are often more tech savvy than we. Putting words into writing not 
only reinforces oral comments, but also provides a tangible document. Your kids 
can save and refer to it at a later date for needed encouragement.</li> 
<li>Creative. Use your imagination when giving feedback, encouragement, or 
support and recognition for your children&rsquo;s achievements. Be 
intentionally out of the box as your imagination figures out new ways to give 
creative encouragement. Some people like verbal support, others prefer written, 
some people like small gifts, and for some just spending time with them is all 
the encouragement they require.</li> </ol> 
<p>Encouragement is a powerful gift, which we need to receive and give on a 
daily basis. Let&rsquo;s be more intentional in giving it to our kids, as it 
will help them with the tools they need to become better adjusted, more well 
rounded and high achieving adults. Be encouraged to be a life-long encourager!!

<p><strong>5 Tools for Effective Families: #4, Grace</strong></p> 
<p>Law or grace?</p> 
<p>That is the question.</p> 
<p>How do you deal with your children and those around you when you&rsquo;re 
angry, frustrated, tired, and burned out?</p> 
<p>Do you&hellip;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>YELL and raise your voice?</li> 
<li>Play the martyr and do the silent treatment?</li> 
<li>Cuss and swear and scream?</li> 
<li>Dole out corporal punishment in the name of training, control, and 
authority&hellip;</li> </ul> 
<p>In other words, how to we use our authority?</p> 
<p>When I talk about fathering, I think of how God the Father deals with me. 
And then I realize his kindness, patience, and love and see how short I fall as 
I deal with others.</p> 
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t always use a stick to beat us when we make mistakes, so 
why are we as fathers so quick to undress and apply the stick of punishment to 
those around us, especially our kids?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be angry, and its okay to not like injustice, 
disobedience, immaturity, and some of the zany things kids do in their 
selfishness.</p> 
<p>But what gives you and me the right when we are tired and frustrated to 
dole out law in the spirit of anger? Our Lord never modeled that type of 
authoritarianism. He did everything in love, including correction, 
chastisement, teaching, and encouragement.</p> 
<p>You and I as men need to relearn authority. We need to not get caught up in 
the disciplinarian model and playing the heavy, which is so common in our 
society. We need to learn the authority of Jesus, based in love, patience, 
kindness, gentleness, goodness, and self-control.</p> 
<p>We need to relearn the father heart of God, and how that applies to our 
leadership and authority over those for whom we have responsibility. We must be 
intentional and incremental in learning this model, as it will transform our 
parenting, and indeed, our lives.</p> 
<p>So, the next time you&rsquo;re faced with someone&rsquo;s shortcomings, or 
your own, for that matter, what&rsquo;s going to be different?</p> 
<p>Will it be grace or law?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>5 Tools for Effective Families: #5, a Relationship with God</strong>
</p> 
<p>The fifth and most important &ldquo;tool&rdquo; is a genuine relationship 
with God, both as an individual and as a family.</p> 
<p>Writing about our relationship with God is extremely difficult. So 
let&rsquo;s start with what it is<strong>not</strong>.</p> 
<p>It is <strong>not</strong>:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>About attending church</li> 
<li>About giving money</li> 
<li>About being&rdquo; good &ldquo;</li> 
<li>About being religious</li> 
<li>About being condemning, condescending, or arrogant about one&rsquo;s faith
</li> 
<li>About religious activity, service, or lifestyle</li> </ol> 
<p>What it <strong>is</strong> about could take up several pages of a blog.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll start with the following:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Knowing and understanding God&rsquo;s Word&ndash;the Bible&ndash;reading 
and meditating on it regularly</li> 
<li>Understanding and having a genuine salvation/saving relationship with God 
by faith in Christ</li> 
<li>Being a person who prays on a regular basis, who has two-way conversations 
with God</li> 
<li>Being a person who&rsquo;s quick to repent, be humble, and truly make 
things right, admitting it when wrong</li> 
<li>Being a person who&rsquo;s willing to serve others, even at their own 
expense</li> 
<li>Living an obedient life, not out of obligation, but out of thankfulness 
and deep gratitude for all God has done</li> 
<li>Allowing God&rsquo;s full expression in me, in my thoughts, my deeds, my 
words, my motivation, my attitude, my resources, and so much more</li> 
<li>Being a person who puts my walk with God as my number one priority in 
life, through prayer, Bible study, praise, worship, sharing my faith, serving 
my church and community and fellow humans.</li> 
<li>Obeying God in the small stuff, being sensitive to details and doing the 
right thing even when no one is looking.</li> 
<li>Relaxing, taking deep breaths, simply appreciating the life and the love 
God has given me, realizing I can not add to this love. I can only respond to 
it by living in the moment, and being the obedient son He&rsquo;s asked that I 
be</li> 
<li>Utilizing the gifts and the resources He&rsquo;s given me in the way that 
He leads me to do so</li> 
<li>Having a heart attitude and disposition that seeks to glorify God in every 
aspect of my life</li> </ol> 
<p>Much of this has to do with what I call a <strong>&ldquo;heart 
attitude&rdquo;</strong>, the core belief system that governs all behaviors, 
words, deeds, and attitudes.</p> 
<p>It stems from the realization of all that God has done for me, is doing, 
and will do in the future. It comes from a heart of deep gratitude, which seeks 
to please, not repay, or pay penance, to the God who loves me and has given his 
all for my life and eternity.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s just this: the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, patience, 
kindness, goodness, gentleness, and faithfulness, and self-control&hellip; 
against such there is no law.&rdquo; These are the heart attitudes which 
demonstrate Christ&rsquo;s likeness. They only come with a genuine long-term 
walk with him.</p> 
<p>Be careful to understand that we&rsquo;re not speaking about perfection. We 
are all human, fallible, frail, weak, and prone to making all manner of 
mistakes. The<strong>giant difference </strong>is having a heart of repentance. 
It&rsquo;s quick to humble, turn, pray, and make course corrections when we 
discover we have sinned against God or people. We need to be good repenters.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything is a bed of roses; in fact 
Christians suffer as much or more than others. The difference here is:&rdquo; 
God works all things together for good for those who love him and are called 
according to his purpose.&rdquo; This means that even the worst challenges, 
problems, and disasters are actually blessings in disguise as we trust God to 
work it all together for good. When a person can live this way, in a faith walk 
with God, all of life takes on a brand-new adventure and excitement, knowing 
that no matter what happens, I&rsquo;m going to become closer and more like my 
Father in each and every situation.</p> 
<p>This is the foundation for a great life, marriage and family. It makes for 
stability, a joy, and the love that permeates a family and a marriage with the 
sweetness and a sanity that is rare and precious.</p> 
<p>To call this Walk with God a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; is to misrepresent and 
underestimate what&rsquo;s being written here.</p> 
<p>This Walk with God is the life-giving, dominant feature of the dedicated 
Christian family and individual. With God at the vanguard of our lives, life 
really becomes worth living.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>5 Tools for Effective Families: Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p>The BIG PARENTING question remains: &ldquo;What is the essence, core 
purpose, or bottom line of our parenting?</p> 
<p>What do we want to leave behind and instill our children, and why?</p> 
<p>At the end of our lives, what would we like to leave behind and pass on to 
our children?</p> 
<p>What heritage, legacy, or inheritance will you leave?</p> 
<p>What will they say about you when you are gone?&hellip;and you and I will 
be gone one day!</p> 
<p>More importantly, how will they live when you are gone?</p> 
<p>Our job as fathers and parents becomes paramount and hugely important for 
our kids!!</p> 
<p>I believe some of that legacy incorporates the following&hellip;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A foundation of faith in God</li> 
<li>Our/Their hopes ,dreams and visions</li> 
<li>Learning contentment and satisfaction</li> 
<li>Children learning to know who they are in God</li> 
<li>Our kids understanding their strengths and weaknesses</li> 
<li>To know they are loved</li> 
<li>To understand fundamental knowledge and wisdom</li> 
<li>To own and live out real values and ethics</li> 
<li>To live a life of thankfulness and appreciation</li> 
<li>To possess as their own a love for God, people, the earth, and all living 
things</li> 
<li>To be able to apply wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, and so much more.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Why </strong>are we leave a legacy is as important as what we leave 
as a legacy.</p> 
<p>You must ask yourself why you&rsquo;d like to be a parent of the highest 
quality.</p> 
<p>What is in it for you, your child, the world at large, and your 
children&rsquo;s children?</p> 
<p>What is your answer?</p> 
<p>I want to leave my children a large heritage: a legacy for generations to 
come. I have a BIG vision for this stuff.</p> 
<p>But herein lays the challenge:</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d like to leave an inheritance<strong> for</strong> my children and 
to<strong>keep it for them,</strong> but I also need <strong>to keep them 
</strong>for it.</p> 
<p>This is what I mean: I want to leave my children a life inheritance, but 
also to<strong>prepare my children</strong> for that inheritance. Acquiring and 
keeping an inheritance for them is relatively easy, the true challenge is to 
also keep them for by instilling a sense of value, faith, and a deep seated 
heart of love for God and people.</p> 
<p>I know I must love them unconditionally, be intentional by making them my 
priority and focus, and to accept and respect and receive my children. These 
are the starting points for a quality inheritance for generations to come.</p> 
<p>If not me, who?</p> 
<p>If not now, when?</p> 
<p>So why not you, and why not now.</p>

<h1>10 Things More Important than Money$$$ on Fathers Day</h1> 
<p>June 9, 2008 by Scott Hammond &nbsp; <br>
 Filed under Family, Fathering, 
Relationships</p> 
<p>Leave a Comment</p> 
<h2>10 THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY $$</h2> 
<p>Remember, there are many things in life that are far more important than 
the size of your investment portfolio or the size of your latest paycheck.</p> 
<p>Too often in our capitalistic society, we place too much emphasis on 
financial achievement and too little on the importance of living a purpose 
driven life.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Family&hellip; your spouse, your parents, and her kids should come first. 
Just simply providing for them does not make your family, your number one 
priority. There is far more you can do for them with quality and quantity time. 
Love is spelled&hellip;. TIME.</li> 
<li>Friends&hellip; the older some of us get, the less time we have for our 
friends. Some people get too busy climbing the success ladder and may not even 
make time for friends. Big mistake. So many things in our society are 
disposable, and sadly, friends too often fall into that category. Take time to 
invest in your friendships, both old and new. How hard is it to schedule a 
Starbucks coffee, pick up the phone, or write an e-mail?</li> 
<li>Your health&hellip; stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, poor 
relationships with you and your family&hellip; all of these can adversely 
affect your health. Getting caught up in your career and working endless hours 
can also lead to neglect of one&rsquo;s health. Workaholism can be deadly. The 
lack of discipline in making exercise, sleep, a good diet, and a healthy 
lifestyle can be dangerous if not deadly as well. You get one body, take care 
of it and treat it with the respect it deserves.</li> 
<li>Kids&hellip; investing in your kids is absolutely one of the best 
investments you can make. Understanding how to relate to, love, care for, and 
communicate with your kids is vital to becoming a more fulfilled and complete 
person. Our future is our children. What kind of legacy are you leaving behind? 
Relationships that are fully orbed or just a fat portfolio?</li> 
<li>Education&hellip; being a lifelong learner is a lifelong process. 
It&rsquo;s not about being enrolled in the school or a fancy college or 
receiving a piece of paper. It is, however, about being someone who is hungry 
to learn, willing to change, and ready to embrace new ways of looking at life 
and the universe. As long as you have your mental capacities, you can keep 
learning and building on what you already know. Your mind is a terrible thing 
to waste.</li> 
<li>Having fun&hellip; people get so caught up in society&rsquo;s money game 
that wealth becomes an addiction, an obsession, and the purpose for their 
existence. How many wealthy people aren&rsquo;t healthy people who spend far 
too much time and energy chasing promotions, money, and possessions. We can end 
up with lots of toys and turn out to be pretty unhappy people&hellip; big 
mistake.</li> 
<li>Solving social problems&hellip; how can you be a voice in society for 
those who do not have the ability to speak for themselves? Whether it&rsquo;s 
poverty, divorce, suicide, teenage pregnancy, name your issue&hellip; you can

<h1>10 Things More Important Than Money&hellip;.</h1>

<p> Remember, there are many things in life that are far more important than 
the size of your investment portfolio or the size of your latest paycheck.</p> 
<p>Too often in our capitalistic society, we place too much emphasis on 
financial achievement and too little on the importance of living a purpose 
driven life.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Family&hellip; your spouse, your parents, and YOUR kids should come 
first.&nbsp; Just simply providing for them does not make your family your 
number one priority.&nbsp; There is far more you can do for them with quality 
and quantity time.&nbsp; Love is spelled&hellip;. TIME.</li> 
<li>Friends&hellip; the older some of us get, the less time we have for our 
friends. Some people get too busy climbing the success laddar and may not even 
make time for friends. Big mistake. So many things in our society are 
disposable, and sadly, friends too often fall into that category. Take time to 
invest in your friendships, both old and new. How hard is it to schedule a 
Starbucks coffee, pick up the phone, or write an e-mail?</li> 
<li>Your Health&hellip; stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, poor 
relationships with you and your family&hellip; all of these can adversely 
affect your health. Getting caught up in your career and working endless hours 
can also lead to neglect of one&rsquo;s health. Workaholism can be deadly. The 
lack of discipline in making exercise, sleep, a good diet, and a healthy 
lifestyle can be dangerous if not deadly as well. You get one body, take care 
of it and treat it with the respect it deserves.</li> 
<li>Kids&hellip; investing in your kids is absolutely one of the best 
investments you can make. Understanding how to relate to, love, care for, and 
communicate with your kids is vital to becoming a more fulfilled and complete 
person. Our future is our children. What kind of legacy are you leaving behind? 
Relationships that are fully orbed or just a fat portfolio?</li> 
<li>Education&hellip; being a lifelong learner is a lifelong process. 
It&rsquo;s not about being enrolled in the school or a fancy college or 
receiving a piece of paper. It is, however, about being someone who is hungry 
to learn, willing to change, and ready to embrace new ways of looking at life 
and the universe. As long as you have your mental capacities, you can keep 
learning and building on what you already know. Your mind is a terrible thing 
to waste.</li> 
<li>Having Fun&hellip; people get so caught up in society&rsquo;s money game 
that wealth becomes an addiction, an obsession, and the purpose for their 
existence. How many wealthy people aren&rsquo;t healthy people who spend far 
too much time and energy chasing promotions, money, and possessions. We can end 
up with lots of toys and turn out to be pretty unhappy people&hellip; big 
mistake.</li> 
<li>Solving Social Problems&hellip; how can you be a voice in society for 
those who do not have the ability to speak for themselves? Whether it&rsquo;s 
poverty, divorce, suicide, teenage pregnancy, name your issue&hellip; you can 
have a voice and be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Your 
community is full of opportunities for you to volunteer, donate time or money, 
and get involved.</li>
