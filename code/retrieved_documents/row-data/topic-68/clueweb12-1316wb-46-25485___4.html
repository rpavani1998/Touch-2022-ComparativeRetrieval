<h1>TESOL Courses</h1> <br>

<p>We have a number of different TESOL certification courses which vary in 
duration, length, price and study methods. All our courses are conducted on the 
principles of providing the highest standard of training possible, so you can 
be sure of a rewarding experience, whichever course you choose. We use the same 
core materials for each of our TESOL courses.</p> 
<h4>Online TESOL Courses &ndash; TESOL Certification Courses</h4> from 
<p>$150</p> &pound; <br>

<p>Our first option is an online TESOL course, which relies 100% on distance 
learning. You have the option of taking the course with a personal online tutor 
or without. Successful completion of the without tutor course is dependant on a 
final test.</p> 
<p>Due to the online nature of the TESOL course, there will be no physical 
teaching practice or time in the classroom. You will however be required to 
view an authentic TESOL lesson via web link or CD-rom.</p> 
<p>The main purpose of our online TESOL courses is to provide an 
internationally recognized and accredited TESOL certificate for those students 
who may not have the time or budget to visit one of our international locations 
and receive on-site training.</p> 
<p>Our online course still ensures a comprehensive training experience, is 
competitively priced and gives you the opportunity to study from anywhere in 
the world. Our generous timeframe also allows you to study comfortably at your 
own pace.</p> 
<p>Additional information and application details</p> 
<h4>Residential, In Class TESOL courses - TESOL Certification Courses</h4> from
<p>$1390</p> &pound; <br>

<p>Our residential TESOL courses are based 100% in the classroom and are run 
in partnership with TEFL International. The main benefit of the residential 
courses is the fact that you will be able to practice teaching English to real 
life students eager to learn the language. This will allow you authentic 
experience in an atmosphere that is pleasurable and without pressure. The 
courses are 4 weeks in duration and are of an intensive nature. Due to courses 
being held in real-life classrooms, all our students will be required to attend 
one of our facilities for the 4-week period. Our locations are numerous and 
situated all over the world.</p> 
<p>Some of the numerous fascinating and exotic locations we have to choose 
from include England, the USA, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Australia, France, 
Thailand, India, China and many, many more.</p> 
<p>Our in-class courses are perfectly suited to those students who wish to 
gain real, authentic practical teaching experience, as well as learning the 
principles, skills, theories and methodologies of TESOL. All of your teaching 
practice will be monitored, supervised and reviewed by an experienced teacher 
trainer. You will have the opportunity to discuss your lesson, receive feedback 
on your performance and work on your strengths and weaknesses for your next 
lesson.</p> 
<p>Additional information and application details</p> 
<h4>Combined TESOL courses - TESOL Certification Courses</h4> from 
<p>$1400</p> &pound; <br>

<p>The combined TESOL course option brings you the opportunity to receive the 
main benefits of the online TESOL and residential TESOL courses.</p> 
<p>You will have the opportunity to study the principles, theories and 
methodologies behind TESOL at your own pace, from the comfort of your own home, 
before putting your theoretical knowledge into practice with a 2-week visit to 
one of our training facilities. Here you will see how the knowledge you have 
learnt is activated, with genuine TESOL teaching practice.</p> 
<p>We understand that the intensive nature of the 4-week course may make some 
students uncomfortable, but that they may also appreciate the opportunity to 
practice in a real TESOL classroom.</p> 
<p>You would only be required to attend one of our TESOL facilities for 2 
weeks, which may be a far more suitable option for you.</p> 
<p>Our combined TESOL course option contains your results in full TESOL 
certifications as it includes all the requirement of the residential TESOL 
course.</p> 
<p>Additional information and application details</p>
