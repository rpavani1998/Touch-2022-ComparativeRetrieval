<h1>Physical Therapists</h1> 
<p><strong>Physical Therapists Job Description</strong></p> 
<p>Physical therapists have an extremely important job. Human health is 
complex and unpredictable for the most part, so people must rely on the 
expertise of health care professionals to care for them when they are ill or 
injured. While doctors may take care of the sick and injured initially, it is 
the duty of physical therapists to ensure that those who were severely injured 
or recovering for a long period of time are able to regain their strength and 
coordination in order to complete routine activities. Physical therapists 
examine each patient and develop treatment plans for them depending on the 
severity of their condition and the likelihood of recovery. Many physical 
therapists work with physicians to determine what treatments can and cannot be 
done, and they keep records of patient progress. Treatments that are not 
yielding the desired results are typically reformed so that they may be more 
beneficial. These therapists typically work in hospitals, outpatient clinics, 
and physician offices. Each work day can be physically demanding as they must 
help patients run, walk, stand, or sit.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Therapists Degree Requirements</strong></p> 
<p>The training to become a physical therapist is intensive and requires 
commitment as well as hard work. All physical therapists must have at least a 
master&rsquo;s degree in physical therapy, which typically takes about two to 
three years after first earning a four-year bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Better 
employment opportunities will arise for those who earn a doctoral degree in the 
subject, however, which typically takes about three years to complete in 
addition to a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. During the degree program, students will 
take courses in anatomy, biology, exercise physiology, radiology and imaging, 
and clinical reasoning. Some courses in behavioral science and therapeutic 
interventions would be beneficial to aspiring physical therapists as well. 
After finishing a master&rsquo;s degree program, students can apply to their 
state for licensure, which may require the completion and passing of a 
standardized examination. Interning at a hospital or clinic would also be 
useful to help boost a prospective physical therapist&rsquo;s resume as well.
</p> 
<p><strong>Why Physical Therapy is a Hot Career</strong></p> 
<p>Health care in general is experiencing a renewed boom in interest and 
popularity. Out of all of the industries, health care is showing the best signs 
of prosperity. This may be due to the fact that the need for health care 
professionals will never go away because of the unpredictable nature of health 
and injury, which drives up the demand for physical therapists. Employment 
opportunities for physical therapists are projected to increase 30% during the 
2008-18 decade, according to theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This 
will add approximately 56,200 more jobs into the market, not including the 
positions that will be open due to retirement or career change. The median 
annual salary for physical therapists was $72,790 in 2008, the latest 
information available from the BLS. However, even the lowest 10% of physical 
therapists earned a hefty salary with an average of less than $50,350 per year.
