<p><strong>How the Physical Therapy Major Prepares You for the Job Market
</strong><br>
 Physical therapy is the study of rehabilitating the body. 
Physical therapy majors have a drive to help patients overcome physical 
limitations so that patients may begin to enjoy a more independent and 
fulfilling life. Physical therapy majors take courses in statistics, ethics, 
aging, biomechanics, and other topics related to enhancing student 
understanding of the overall health profession and physical therapy-specific 
treatments and techniques. In addition to course work, students must also 
complete several sessions of outside clinical work in order to graduate. These 
outside work sessions enhance the learning experience so that students may also 
see professionals working in the field as well as participate in gaining 
hands-on work experience while also learning in the classrooms. This coupling 
of classroom education and real-world work gives students the practice they 
need to apply classroom techniques to real-life situations. All of these 
practices make physical therapy majors a valuable asset to the work force upon 
graduation.</p> 
<p><strong>Best Career Paths for Physical Therapy Majors</strong><br>
 
Physical therapy offers an entry into many rewarding careers in health care. 
The best career paths for physical therapy majors are:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Physical Therapy</i>. Physical therapists work with patients of all 
ages who need assistance in recovering function of injured body parts or help 
in coping with permanent conditions or disabilities. For example, physical 
therapists may work with helping those with a previously broken leg relearn how 
to walk, or they may work with the elderly in maintaining optimal use and 
function of their increasingly fragile bodies. Physical therapists often work 
with other health care professionals to develop the best course of treatment 
for individual patients. They must also work with patients one-on-one, taking 
detailed notes on the patient&iacute;s progress and making changes to a therapy 
regime to suit the patient&iacute;s needs. Physical therapists earn an average 
salary of $72,790 annually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</li> 
<li><i>Chiropractics</i>. Chiropractors work with patients suffering from 
musculoskeletal problems, such as back pain, arthritis, and other similar 
ailments. They specialize in the manual treatment of the spine, utilizing 
manual manipulation to relieve aches, pains, and other ailments. A 
chiropractor&iacute;s work is based on the principle that spinal misalignment 
can interfere with patient health because it disrupts the nervous system. 
Spinal realignment, therefore, provides relief. Chiropractors assess each 
patient on an individual basis, determining the cause of each patient&iacute;s 
condition and developing a unique treatment plan to cater to that 
patient&iacute;s condition. Chiropractors earn an average salary of $66,490 
annually, according to the Bureau.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>How to Market Your Physical Therapy Degree</strong><br>
 The best 
way to market your physical therapy degree to potential employers is to 
emphasize that your formal education provided you with valuable skills that can 
be applied to real-world situations. For example, you learned about the process 
and effects of aging during one of your courses, which in turn helped you to 
identify many possible afflictions that an elderly patient can have. 
Participating in outside clinical work also helped you to develop a keen sense 
of what it is like to work in the field. These points are important to stress 
to employers to have them understand the extent of your experience and 
knowledge as well as your capability to apply those skills in the field.</p>
