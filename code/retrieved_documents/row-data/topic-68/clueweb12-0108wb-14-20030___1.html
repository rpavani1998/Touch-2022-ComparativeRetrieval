<h1>Arthritis sufferers are not engaging in enough physical activity</h1> 
<p> Wed, 31 Aug 2011 | Category: Fitness News </p> 
<p>&#65279;<em>Physical activity is one of the best ways people with arthritis 
can improve function and reduce pain, yet many are not achieving the 
recommended levels according to a new study.</em></p> 
<p>The study at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago 
found that more than half of women and 40% of men with arthritis are 
practically sedentary and not engaging in the physical activity that is vital 
to their health.</p> 
<p>Researchers asked more than 1,000 people, aged 49 to 84, with radiographic 
knee osteoarthritis to wear an accelerometer &ndash; a small device that 
measures physical activity &ndash; for one week. Past research had relied on 
surveys to account for exercise and activity.</p> 
<p>Australian guidelines recommend that all adults participate in 30 minutes 
of moderate-intensity activity most days, but preferably every day.</p> 
<p>Previous studies estimated that a quarter of arthritis sufferers met those 
guidelines, but the study revealed that fewer than one in seven men, and only 
one in 12 women actually did meet them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What is even more alarming is that 40% of men and 56% of women didn&rsquo;t 
even sustain 10 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity over the course of the 
week, putting them in the &lsquo;inactive&rsquo; category.</p> 
<p>The findings, published in the <em>Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism</em>, suggest 
this is a huge untouched market for fitness professionals.</p>
