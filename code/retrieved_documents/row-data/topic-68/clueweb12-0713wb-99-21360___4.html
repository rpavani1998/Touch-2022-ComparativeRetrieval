<h3> <strong>Handy Tips for the Online Learner</strong></h3> 
<p> Many students approach an online course with the mistaken belief that 
either (1) an online course is easier than a course in a traditional classroom 
(what we often call a &quot;brick and mortar&quot; class), or (2) the same 
skills that one uses in a traditional learning environment can be used in an 
online course.&nbsp; While there are no absolutes in the world of student 
learning (since we all learn differently!), experience tells us that online 
courses can both be more challenging than a traditional course and require a 
different kind of engagement than what you might need in a regular class.</p> 
<p> So, what's so different?&nbsp; Well, consider these factors:</p> 
<p> A traditional class normally forces (or at least encourages) one to attend 
class in a physical space on a regular schedule - say, three days a week.&nbsp; 
An online course is typically (though not always)&quot;asynchronous,&quot; 
meaning one can log on to the class at their convenience.&nbsp; Thus, in an 
online environment, learning requires an added level of personal 
discipline.&nbsp; The temptation to procrastinate and catch up later is 
powerful, but must be resisted!</p> 
<p> A traditional class presents students with opportunities for real-time 
discussion, lectures from which notes can be taken, and an opportunity for 
immediate feedback from the instructor.&nbsp; Online classes almost always 
include&quot;threaded discussions&quot; which are conversations facilitated 
electronically within thelearning management system.&nbsp; The asynchronous 
nature of online learning means that you may not receive immediate feedback on 
your comments or questions.&nbsp; Thus, a student must regularly return to the 
course discussion board to remain engaged.&nbsp; You will find that the best 
online courses use other interactive tools - not just discussion boards - to 
build community and create a good conversation.</p> 
<p> A traditional class sometimes makes it possible for a student to avoid 
doing assigned reading, or at least makes it possible for certain learners to 
obtain the information they need from lecture slides and classroom 
discussions.&nbsp; While this is a dirty secret nobody likes to admit, every 
experienced student probably knows someone who has tried this.&nbsp; While such 
an approach to learning is ill advised in a brick and mortar class, it is even 
MORE ill advised in an online course.&nbsp; Most instructors will expect 
students in an online environment to take responsibility for familiarizing 
themselves with the content of the course.&nbsp; This means students will need 
to read materials completely, participate in online activities and assessments, 
and actively seek-out alternative sources for supplemental information.&nbsp; 
There's no cutting corners in an online class.</p> 
<p> At this point you might be asking:&nbsp; &quot;If these things are so 
different, why would I want to take an online course?&quot;&nbsp; This is a 
fair question, but there are a lot of really great answers.</p> 
<p> First, a lot of research indicates the power of online learning.&nbsp; 
While research seems to suggest that the optimal combination for learning is a 
&quot;hybrid&quot; environment involving both online and brick-and-mortar 
components in the same class, other research suggests that online learning can 
be as effective as the traditional classroom experience.&nbsp; Some studies 
even suggest that online learning may have an edge with<em>some</em> 
learners.&nbsp; Thus, if there is a compelling reason (such as cost, 
convenience, work schedule, family obligations, etc.) online learning can be a 
great option.</p>

<p> Second, for the serious learner who is really interested in taking charge 
of their own learning, online learning can be inspiring.&nbsp;<strong>Moving 
online doesn't replace the teacher.&nbsp;</strong>In our view, your professor 
is as important in an online environment as they are in the traditional 
classroom.&nbsp; However, if you're the kind of person who LOVES digging 
deeper, surfing the Internet for those little pieces of trivia, or engaging 
material that touches the range of your senses (text, video, audio, etc.), 
you'll find online learning really attractive.</p> 
<p> Finally, there are very practical reasons for the convenience of 
asynchronous learning.&nbsp; Particularly for adult learners, working 
professionals, or undergraduate students with other obligations competing for 
their time, online courses allow the disciplined student to manage competing 
obligations and go to class when they have the time to focus their attention on 
their work.</p> 
<p> The thoughtful student will try to keep the following factors in mind when 
planning for their participation in an online class.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<h3> <strong>Are you prepared to do a lot of quality writing?&nbsp; </strong>
</h3> 
<p> Online courses require a lot of writing.&nbsp; Many courses will involve 
small writing assignments, such as journal entries or blogs, to keep you on 
task and help the instructor evaluate whether or not you are understanding the 
material.&nbsp; There's also an expectation, in most courses, that you will 
engage in regular discussions using discussion boards.&nbsp; You may have 
full-length papers as well.&nbsp; Because you aren't using your voice the way 
you would in a traditional classroom, your writing must substitute for your 
voice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<h3> <strong>Are you comfortable asking questions on a regular basis? </strong>
&nbsp;</h3> 
<p> Online courses do not provide the immediate feedback you get in a 
traditional classroom setting.&nbsp; Where you might be able to remain silent 
in a traditional classroom and rely on others to ask the questions you really 
need the answers to, you cannot always count on that happening in an online 
course.&nbsp; Moreover, asking questions in an asynchronous environment is an 
essential part of moving discussions forward.&nbsp; Not only will you need 
questions answered, but your professor will expect you to ask questions in 
order to demonstrate you are an active part of the learning community.</p> 
<p> We've assembled some useful resources in the links below to help you think 
critically about the choice to take an online course.&nbsp; Online learning is 
not for everyone, so be sure you make your decision with the benefit of good 
information!&nbsp; If you're unsure if online learning is right for you, feel 
free to contact our office with questions!</p>
