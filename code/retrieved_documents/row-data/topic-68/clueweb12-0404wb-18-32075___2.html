<p><b>Question from a Reader:</b> <i>&quot;I am currently a freshman and I am 
planning to major in psychology. However, I don't want to be limited to just 
taking psychology courses. I want to explore all of my possibilities and study 
a broad range of topics such as English, statistics, philosophy, sociology and 
even fine arts. I feel like psychology is related to every aspect of our lives, 
so all of these topics can be tied back in with my major. Do you think it is a 
good idea to take such a wide variety of classes or should I just stick to the 
core psychology curriculum? What are some good electives for psychology 
majors?&quot;</i></p> 
<p>Before you start signing up for courses, you should make an appointment 
with an academic advisor at your university to discuss your plans. Your advisor 
can help you sort through all the requirements you need to fulfill in order to 
earn your degree and provide a clearer picture of the courses you should take. 
While your plans may changes over time, starting out with a solid understanding 
of what you will need to do in order to graduate is always a good idea.</p> 
<h3>Focus on Required Courses First</h3> 
<p>Of course, you will need to take classes to fulfill your school's general 
education requirements as well as your major's departmental requirements. 
General education courses usually include a certain number of credits of math, 
physical and biological sciences, writing and composition and social sciences. 
Beyond the general education and departmental requirements, you can then take 
elective courses based upon your interests.</p> 
<p>During your first year or two of college, you should concentrate on taking 
the required general education and major classes. If you end up filling your 
schedule with elective courses during the early years of your college 
education, you may find yourself scrambling to play catch up during your junior 
and senior year. By saving most of your electives for the third and fourth 
year, you'll be able to enjoy some fun and interesting courses when many of 
your required program courses are starting to get tougher and more challenging.
</p> 
<p>Remember that not all schools and programs are the same. General education 
requirements may also vary depending on the type of degree you are earning. For 
example, Bachelor of Science degrees involve taking more science courses, while 
Bachelor of Arts degrees usually involve more liberal arts classes and often 
include a certain number of foreign language credits. Talk to your advisor to 
learn more about thedifferences between a B.A. and a B.S. in Psychology.</p> 
<p>While the requirements vary from program to program, but some of the most 
commonly required core psychology classes include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Introduction to Psychology</li> 
<li>Statistics</li> 
<li>Research Methods</li> 
<li>Abnormal Psychology</li> 
<li>Personality Psychology</li> </ul> 
<p>Other classes that may or may not be required by your program include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>History of Psychology</li> 
<li>Social Psychology</li> 
<li>Physiological Psychology</li> 
<li>Cognitive Psychology</li> 
<li>Sensation and Perception</li> </ul> 
<p>Most psychology programs also require a minimum number of psychology 
electives in order to graduate. One of the big advantages of taking electives 
is that these courses are oftenprerequisite classes for many psychology 
graduate programs.</p> 
<h3>Electives for Psychology Majors</h3> 
<p>Many students choose to take elective courses that are related to their 
future career goals. For example, a student with an interest inconsumer 
psychology might focus on electives in areas like marketing, advertising, 
social psychology, experimental design and statistics.</p> 
<p>Other students might opt to take some elective courses in psychology along 
with classes in other interest areas. For example, a students interested in 
pursuing a career inart therapy might take fine arts classes as part of her 
undergraduate electives.</p> 
<p>Some of the electives that might be of interest to psychology majors 
include courses in:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sociology</li> 
<li>Public affairs</li> 
<li>Social work</li> 
<li>Anthropology</li> 
<li>Communications</li> 
<li>Criminal justice</li> 
<li>Biology</li> 
<li>Health sciences</li> 
<li>History</li> 
<li>English composition</li> 
<li>Statistics</li> 
<li>Political science</li> 
<li>Philosophy</li> </ul> 
<p>As you choose electives, think about how these courses relate to your 
career goals. If you plan on being a research psychology, classes in 
statistics, writing and research methods would prove particularly useful. On 
the other hand, if you are thinking of a career in mental health, courses in 
biology and health sciences might be the most beneficial.</p> 
<p>This is why it is so important to talk to your academic advisor. Your 
advisor can inform you about specific university requirements as well as make 
additional suggestions based on your major, interests and goals. A good idea is 
to make a four-year academic plan outlining the courses that you would like to 
take each semester. This not only ensures that you meet all of the requirements 
of your degree program; it also allows you to see where you can schedule in 
elective courses.</p> 
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3> 
<p>College is a time to prepare for your future and explore your academic 
interests. While you should certainly focus on your core courses first and 
foremost, you should plan on scheduling at least a few elective courses in 
order to get the minimum credits needed to graduate. Elective courses are an 
excellent way to learn more about new subjects and broaden your education, so 
spend some time browsing through your school's course catalog to familiarize 
yourself with what is available.</p> <br>
