<h1>Do classroom home inspection courses harm consumers?</h1> by Nick Gromicko

&nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<p>Online written and video courses are perfect for educating and improving 
the competence of home inspectors and providing options for their primary and 
Continuing Education.&nbsp; Advantages over classroom courses include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cost of&nbsp;Course:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses are inexpensive 
or free.&nbsp; Dollar for dollar, an inspector can complete many online courses 
for the same cost as a single classroom course.&nbsp; The more education an 
inspector has, the better he/she can serve his/her clients.&nbsp; Compared to 
online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by exhausting the Continuing 
Education budgets of inspectors faster than online courses.</p> <strong>Cost of 
Travel:</strong>&nbsp; There are no travel or hotel costs associated with 
online courses.&nbsp; In contrast, relevant classroom courses, which are few 
and far between, cause the inspector to&nbsp;incur out-of-pocket&nbsp;travel 
and accommodation costs.&nbsp; Again, the more education an inspector has, the 
better he/she can serve his/her clients.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, 
classroom courses harm consumers by exhausting the Continuing Education budgets 
of inspectors faster than online courses.  &nbsp; <strong>Cost of Lost Work:
</strong> &nbsp;An inspector need not take off work to complete online 
courses.&nbsp; Online courses can be taken at night, on the weekends, or 
whenever an inspector doesn&#146;t have any inspections scheduled.&nbsp; In 
contrast, classroom courses are often&nbsp;offered only during the day and 
require the inspector to suffer lost business income.&nbsp; Again, the more 
education an inspector has, the better he/she can serve his/her clients.&nbsp; 
Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by exhausting the 
Continuing Education budgets of inspectors faster than online courses.  &nbsp; 
<p><strong>Cost Advantage to Consumers:</strong> Online inspection courses are 
simply more affordable to inspectors. With reduced course costs come an 
increase in the number of courses an inspector can afford to complete each 
year, with a corresponding rise in the level of inspector competence. 
Increasing the level of inspector competence is a direct benefit to 
consumers.&nbsp; Lower-cost education also gives inspectors the opportunity to 
pass on savings to consumers.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom 
courses harm consumers by&nbsp;delaying the inspector's professional progress.
</p> 
<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses are available all the 
time, anytime, from anywhere.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses for the 
inspection industry are few and far between.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, 
classroom courses harm consumers by limiting access to education for inspectors.
</p> 
<p><strong>Collaboration in Development:</strong>&nbsp; Online course 
development often includes collaboration&nbsp;among many experts and inspectors 
from around the world. &nbsp;For example, it is not unusual for
InterNACHI&#146;s online courses to be the product of dozens of 
contributors.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm 
consumers by often lacking in international collaborative development.</p> 
<p><strong>Expert Instruction:</strong>&nbsp; Online course developers can 
hire many experts to contribute to each course.&nbsp; Often, in online video 
courses, the instruction is presented by one or more renowned experts.&nbsp; In 
contrast, classroom instructors, though perhaps competent to teach a particular 
subject, are rarely international experts.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, 
classroom courses harm consumers by denying renowned expertise instruction to 
inspectors and limiting them to a local pool of talent.</p> 
<p><strong>Number of Instructors:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses often utilize 
more than one instructor, with more than one area of expertise.&nbsp; In 
contrast, most classroom courses are taught by only one instructor.&nbsp; 
Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by limiting the 
number of expert instructors per course.</p> 
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses are reviewed for accuracy 
before being released.&nbsp; Online courses are also subjected to industry-wide 
peer review forever.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom instruction is rarely 
reviewed by anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;The author of this article personally knows of 
a physics professor who had been teaching the use of an incorrect formula for 
over 30 years before the error was caught.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, 
classroom courses harm consumers by failing to correct 
misinformation&nbsp;given to inspectors in a timely fashion.</p> 
<p><strong>Current Course Material:</strong>&nbsp; Downloadable, printable 
online course material is reviewed, edited and improved over time.&nbsp; In 
contrast, classroom texts are less frequently updated.&nbsp; Compared to online 
courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being less able to provide 
inspectors with current course material.</p> 
<p><strong>Pictures and Video:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses contain pictures 
and on-location video that permit the inspector to virtually accompany the 
instructors on inspections of many actual structures and components.&nbsp; In 
contrast, classroom courses can&#146;t take inspectors into crawlspaces or on 
roofs.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by 
failing to provide inspectors with virtual, real-situation training.</p> 
<strong>Pace:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses move at each inspector&#146;s 
desired pace. &nbsp;Online courses can be stopped and re-started.&nbsp; Online 
video can be paused.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses move at only the 
instructor&#146;s speed.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom courses 
harm consumers by being unable to teach at each inspector&#146;s own pace.  
&nbsp; <strong>Wasted Time:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses are edited to cut out 
set-up time, off-topic discussions, bathroom breaks, lunchtime, etc.&nbsp; In 
contrast, classroom courses contain much wasted time.&nbsp; Compared to online 
courses, classroom courses harm consumers by diluting the training time with 
things that don't increase inspector competence.  &nbsp; 
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses are available when each 
inspector wants to take them.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses have 
inflexible schedules that require inspectors to attend when it is inconvenient, 
when the inspector is ill, when the inspector is tired, etc.&nbsp; Compared to 
online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by forcing inspectors to study 
and learn at a preset schedule.</p> 
<p><strong>Quizzes and Exams:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses contain numerous 
short quizzes that assure the inspector has learned each section before moving 
on to the next.&nbsp; These quizzes are graded instantly, and often alert the 
inspector to incorrect answers immediately.&nbsp; Some even have built-in 
intelligence, which recognizes each inspector&#146;s unique areas of weakness, 
and reviews those areas until the inspector grasps them.&nbsp; Classroom 
courses typically have fewer quizzes, without instant grading.&nbsp; Compared 
to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being less diligent 
about assuring that each inspector has learned and understands every concept 
being taught.</p> 
<p><strong>Review:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses permit inspectors to go back 
and review areas of weakness. &nbsp;For example, &nbsp;InterNACHI&#146;s online 
video courses permit the inspector to rewind and replay them&nbsp;over and 
over.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom&nbsp;material is typically&nbsp;covered 
only&nbsp;once.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm 
consumers by being unable to allow inspectors&nbsp;go back and repeat material 
to strengthen his/her particular areas of weakness.</p> 
<p><strong>Repeat:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses permit inspectors to take the 
course over again.&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses are typically 
taken only once.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm 
consumers by being all but impossible for inspectors to re-take over and over.
</p> <strong>Instant Grading:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses contain quizzes and 
final exams that are graded instantly.&nbsp; Instant grading permits the 
inspector to be alerted to areas of weakness while still engaged in the 
course.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses typically don&#146;t grade 
instantly.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers 
by being unable to instantly grade each quiz and exam. <strong><br>
</strong> 
<strong>Consistent Grading:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses and quizzes are 
graded consistently over time and around the world.&nbsp; In contrast, 
classroom courses grade easier or harder, depending on where and when&nbsp;the 
inspector&nbsp;takes each course.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom 
courses harm consumers by being unable to grade inspectors consistently.  &nbsp;
<p><strong>Advanced Courses</strong>:&nbsp; It is financially feasible to 
offer advanced courses online. &nbsp;An online course need be developed only 
once, yet can run for years.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses usually must 
be of an introductory nature to attract enough students to pay for an 
instructor each time it is offered.&nbsp; Compared to online courses, classroom 
courses harm consumers by being unable to financially sustain advanced course 
offerings.</p> 
<p><strong>Specialty Courses:</strong>&nbsp; It is financially feasible to 
offer specialty courses online.&nbsp; An online course need be developed only 
once, yet can run for years.&nbsp; In contrast, classroom courses usually 
must&nbsp;have a&nbsp;common enough appeal of subject matter in order&nbsp;to 
attract enough students to pay for an instructor each time it is offered.&nbsp; 
Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to 
financially sustain specialty course offerings.</p> 
<p><strong>Choice:</strong>&nbsp; Online courses offer inspectors a wide 
variety of choices in both level and subject matter.&nbsp; In contrast, 
classroom courses are fewer and farther between.&nbsp; Compared to online 
courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being less likely to offer the 
training inspectors need, when and where they need it.</p> <strong>
Communication:</strong> &nbsp;Online courses often provide an Internet forum 
for all current students, graduates, instructors, experts, developers and 
interested parties from around the world to interact with each other and 
discuss the course.&nbsp; These course-specific forums provide continuing 
education to inspectors long after completing the course.&nbsp; Classroom 
courses harm consumers by rarely providing such widespread, post-course 
interaction.  &nbsp; 
<p>In summary, online courses allow inspectors to study and learn at little or 
no cost, without having to travel or lose business, when and where they want, 
with well-developed, accurate courses taught by experts, using updated course 
material, pictures and video, at their own pace and schedule, with the ability 
to review and repeat, and with the assurance they'll end up with a thorough 
understanding of the chosen topic.</p>  Home inspection licensing board members 
or government bureaucrats who steer inspectors away from online course 
offerings by rejecting their Continuing Education approval based solely on 
their method of Internet delivery create a disincentive to inspector skill-set 
improvement, which ultimately harms consumers.&nbsp; And because much of an 
inspection report includes safety issues, the harm may also be physical, 
instead of merely financial.&nbsp; In some cases, the harm may result in the 
actual death of either the inspector or the&nbsp;consumer.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; U.S. 
Department of Education study showing online courses are better than classroom 
courses. <br>

 &nbsp; 
<p>Below are the names, pictures, addresses and phone numbers of home 
inspection licensing board members and government bureaucrats who summarily 
withhold Continuing Education approval of online courses and, thus, are 
responsible for the financial and physical harm, and perhaps even death, of 
their fellow citizens:</p> As of today, no InterNACHI online course approvals 
have ever been rejected by anyone. <br>
