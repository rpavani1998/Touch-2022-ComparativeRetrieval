<p>The schedule is subject to changes during the semester. Students are 
responsible for keeping track of changes. The web page schedule will be updated 
when changes occur.</p> 
<p>A detailed outline of each day's topics is available at the Lecture Material
 links on the course web page.</p> 
<h3>Text Book - Required</h3> 
<p><em>Visualizing Geology</em>, by Murck, Skinner, and Mackenzie </p> 
<h3>Lab Manual - Required</h3> 
<p><em>Physical Geology 101 Lab Manual</em>, by Richard Harwood <br>
<em>
Mineral and Rock Identification Atlas</em>, by Richard Harwood </p> 
<h3>Web Page Study Materials</h3> 
<p>Lecture outlines, study material, additional information, reading material 
and study guide questions may be found on the BHC Physical Geology Web Page 
under the Lecture Material link at the following URL:<br>

http://facweb.bhc.edu/academics/science/harwoodr/geol101/index.htm </p> 
<p><b>NOTICE:</b> It is strongly recommended that students access, print out 
and read the lecture notes prior to attending class.</p> 
<p><b>WARNING:</b> The web page lecture notes are intended to be used to 
enhance and assist students in acquiring and learning the material presented in 
the lectures. They are designed to allow students to follow along and 
contribute to lectures without the need to write everything down in notes. The 
web page lecture notes, however, do not contain all of the material presented 
in class. The web page lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to lecture 
- attendance is required for successful completion of the course. The web page 
lecture notes alone will not see you through this course without attending 
lecture.</p> 
<p>Students may access the Internet at any of the open computer labs on 
campus. Computers are available in the Independent Learning Center, Library and 
the Science Resources Lab (Rm 2-210). Students do not need an account or login 
name to access the Internet in these labs. Assistance is available in the labs 
for students that have never accessed material on the World Wide Web.</p> 
<h3>Blackboard Access</h3> 
<p>Access to some of this material is password protected on <em>myBlackHawk
</em> and Blackboard (formerly WebCT). To access this material and other online 
resources, login to myBlackHawk at:http://myblackhawk.bhc.edu </p> 
<p>Login information to <em>myBlackHawk</em> was provided to you when you 
enrolled at BHC. If you have forgotten this login information or have 
difficulties logging in to myBlackHawk follow the directions in the Secure 
Access Login box at the<em>myBlackHawk</em> homepage. Once into <em>myBlackHawk
</em> go to the Academics tab, then click on the My Courses link. Click on the 
Physical Geology course link.</p> 
<h3>Exams</h3> 
<p>There are four exams. Each exam will be comprehensive. The majority of 
questions, approximately 80%, will cover material from the most recent 
lectures, with additional questions covering major topics, concepts and 
definitions from the previous sections and exams. Exams may not be taken before 
the scheduled exam time - no exceptions.</p> 
<h3>Exam Format</h3> 
<p>Each exam may contain one or more of the following items: multiple choice 
questions, true/false statements, matching, fill-in-the-blank statements, short 
essay topics, and full length essay topics. Students should read the Essay 
Policy prior to taking an exam. This policy may be found at the following URL:
http://facweb.bhc.edu/academics/science/harwoodr/Essay.htm </p> 
<h3>Missed Exams and Lab Practicals</h3> 
<p>Missed exams and lab practicals will be made up by class time the first day 
that the student returns to class - no exceptions. For example, let's say you 
miss the first exam on Wednesday, Sept. 14th. You then come to the next class 
period on Friday, Sept. 16th. You would be required to take the exam at that 
time, during the class period. Failure to take the exam at that time will 
result in a score of zero. All missed exams will be taken in the ILC's Testing 
Center. Students may arrange to take the exam prior to the next class period, 
and are encouraged to do so. Contact the ILC for Testing Room hours.</p> 
<h3>Extra Credit</h3> 
<p>There are no extra credit assignments. </p> 
<h3>Grading</h3> 
<p>The final grade will be calculated according to the following percentages: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exams and Practicals - 75% <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lab 
Assignments - 25%</p> 
<p>Click here to use a Grade Calculator to figure out your grade in the course.
</p> 
<h3>Grades</h3> 
<p>All grades will be assigned using the following scale: <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = 90-100%<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B = 80-89% <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C = 70-79%<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D = 60-69% <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F = &lt;60%<br>
No incompletes (I) will be given for any 
reason.</p> 
<p>My policy on grades is that you will receive the grade that you earn. I do 
not &quot;give&quot; grades, you earn them. The grade that you earn will be 
based upon your knowledge of the required material, your skills in the required 
activities and your participation, performance and attitude.</p> 
<h3>Web Page Grade Posting</h3> 
<p>Individual grades may be accessed through <em>myBlackHawk</em> and 
Blackboard (formerly WebCT):<br>
See the Blackboard Access section above for 
details on your access to this information.</p> 
<h3>Attendance</h3> 
<p>Daily attendance is not taken in this course. However, if you miss four 
lecture or lab class hours, either consecutively or cumulatively, you may be 
officially withdrawn from the class for non-attendance. You will be checked off 
for attendance on a weekly basis during lab.</p> 
<h3>Missed Classes</h3> 
<p>I am not interested in hearing excuses for missed classes. Whether you are 
in class or not, you are responsible for all material and announcements 
presented in the lecture and lab sections. It is your job to make sure you have 
all of the current information. Missed assignments must be turned in by class 
time the first day that the student returns to class - no exceptions. Missed 
exams and lab practicals will be made up by class time the first day that the 
student returns to class - no exceptions. Failure to take the exam at that time 
will result in a score of zero.</p> 
<h3>Behavior</h3> 
<p>You are all adults and I expect you to have behavior appropriate to a 
college level class - this is not High School. The classroom environment should 
be professional and friendly. Anyone showing disruptive behavior will be asked 
to leave. Disruptive behavior includes but is not limited to: a) using 
profanities, b) intentionally damaging classroom or laboratory materials, c) 
using cellular phones (Cell phones are to be turned off during class, labs and 
exams), d) playing video games, surfing the internet or using a computer for 
anything other than class related activities while the instructor is addressing 
the class, e) placing feet on the lab table tops while class is in session, f) 
excessive talking while the instructor is addressing the class, and g) creating 
an environment that is not conducive to learning for others.</p> 
<p>Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Copying another's work, 
plagiarism and cheating on tests may be punishable by a failing grade on that 
assignment or exam, or a failing grade for the course - depending on the 
severity of the incident.</p> 
<h3>Food in the Classroom</h3> 
<p>I have no objection to your bringing food or drink into lecture or lab. 
However, it is your responsibility to clean up after yourself. Because other 
instructors and students use the classroom, don't leave your trash on the lab 
benches. Put all aluminum cans, plastic bottles and office paper in the proper 
recycling containers in the hall. Throw all other trash in the waste can in the 
classroom. If I find trash being left on the lab benches in lab or lecture I 
will ban all food and drink for everyone for the remainder of the semester.</p> 
<h3>Due Dates</h3> 
<p>You are responsible for knowing due dates and exam dates. They are on your 
syllabus, know them, even if they are not announced in class.</p> 
<h3>Class Preparation</h3> 
<p>I expect you to have read the lecture assignments prior to coming to class. 
Be prepared to discuss the material. A discussion requires at least two people 
that have read the material and are prepared to examine that information. A 
discussion with only one participant is a lecture.</p> 
<h3>Course Objectives</h3> 
<p>Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to: <br>
1) 
Summarize the dynamics of Plate Tectonics.<br>
2) Identify and discuss the 
formation and composition of common rocks and minerals.<br>
3) Describe the 
processes of earthquakes, volcanism and crustal deformation.<br>
4) Describe 
weathering and erosion surface processes.</p> 
<h3>Assessment of Student Learning</h3> 
<p>The following assessment methods, measures and techniques may be used 
during the semester to determine how well students are learning.</p>  
Background Knowledge Probes; Muddiest Point; Classroom Opinion Polls; 
Misconception/Preconception Check; Formal student evaluations; Group 
discussions and comments; Student research papers; Student oral presentations; 
Written exams; Questioning of prior material; Questioning and discussions 
during lab periods; Analysis of individual student's comments, questions and 
answers to instructor questions during the class period; Analysis of lab 
activities for clarity, workability and content, based on student 
participation, questions, assignment answers and comments in lab; 
Individualized tutoring for students. 
<h3>Withdrawal from the Course</h3> 
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to talk with the instructor before 
withdrawing from the course to discuss your reasons for withdrawal, and to 
discuss options other than withdrawal. If you need to withdraw from the course 
for any reason, you may do so without instructor approval prior to completion 
of three-quarters of the course. Withdrawal from the course is the 
responsibility of the student. Students may either complete the Black Hawk 
College Add/Drop form or send a letter, fax, or email from the student's 
myBlackHawk account to the Registrar. After three-quarters of the course is 
completed, but no later than the last scheduled day of instruction, students 
must obtain instructor permission to withdraw from the course. Students may not 
drop the course after the last day of instruction. (see the Student Handbook 
for the official college policy on withdrawals)</p>

<h3>Lab Exercises</h3> 
<p>Lab exercises are to be completed during the lab period and turned in at 
the end of the lab. Students are expected to remain in lab for the full hour 
and fifty minutes, working on the lab assignment and studying past lab 
assignments.</p> 
<h3>Missed Labs</h3> 
<p>Missed labs must be completed within one week of the date of the assigned 
lab. For example, if you miss Lab #2, it must be complete prior to Lab #3. Labs 
completed before the following week's lab will receive full credit for that 
lab. No credit will be given for labs completed after the one week grace 
period. However, it is to your advantage to complete all labs, even late labs, 
as you will be tested over the material on the lab practical. You are 
responsible for making arrangements to make up a lab.</p> 
<h3>Lab Practicals</h3> 
<p>There will be four lab practicals. These are equivalent to exams and will 
test your knowledge and skills on the lab material. Missed lab practicals will 
be made up by class time the first day that the student returns to class. 
Failure to take the lab practical at that time will result in a score of zero.
</p> 
<p>Each lab practical will be based directly on the activities in the lab 
exercises. For example, in the Mineral Identification lab you will be 
identifying 20 different minerals. On the Lab Practical, you can expect to 
identify minerals.</p> 
<p><b>WARNING</b> - For Lab Practicals II and III students will be required to 
identify mineral physical properties, mineral names, rock textures, rock 
compositions and rock names. Identification charts and lists (as used during 
lab activities) will not be used during the Practicals. This means that you 
must know the proper terms and identifications from memory. This requires 
practice - lots of practice. This requires that you spend time with the rocks 
and minerals - more time than one viewing of the material during the lab 
activity. It is recommended that once you have completed a given week's lab 
activity, that you spend additional time in lab reviewing the previous week's 
materials. Failure to spend this additional time reviewing and studying the 
rocks and minerals will greatly increase your chances of failing the first two 
Lab Practicals.</p> 
<h3>Lab Materials</h3> 
<p>The only materials that you will need to bring are your lab manual, and 
writing utensils.<b>USE A PENCIL</b> to complete each assignment. Errors will 
be made and are easier to correct in pencil than in pen. The lab manual, 
Mineral and Rock Identification Atlas, and textbook should be brought to lab as 
well. A calculator is recommended and necessary for the completion of some lab 
assignments. All other materials will be provided.</p> 
<p>A full set of mineral and rock samples, and testing equipment (excluding 
HCl) is available at the BHC Library's Circulation Desk. This material may only 
be checked for use in the library. An additional set of minerals and rocks are 
available in Room 210 in Building 2.</p> 
<h3>Working on Lab Assignments</h3> 
<p>Do your own work. You may work in groups or alone but you alone are 
responsible for knowing the material. Students often fail the lab portion of 
the course because they let someone else do the work. You will be tested as an 
individual on your knowledge and skills during the lab practical - you will not 
be tested as a group. Do your own work.</p> 
<h3>Evaluation of Completed Lab Assignments</h3> 
<p>Lab assignments will be evaluated prior to the student being dismissed from 
lab. The instructor and student will go over the lab assignment together to 
check for errors and make corrections. Upon completion the lab will contain all 
the correct answers. The student will only receive credit for the lab once the 
instructor and student have gone over the lab assignment.</p> 
<h3>Web Page Lab Supplements</h3> 
<p>Additional lab activities can be found Online. These activities include 
identification of minerals, igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic 
rocks. To find this material go to the URL below and click on Lab Material.<br>
