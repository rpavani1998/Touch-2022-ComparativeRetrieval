<p>This is an instructional or logistical problem to solve for a planned 
online course on Human Computer Interaction, and we are looking for examples of 
other courses that are doing something similar, or best practice guidance from 
this community.</p> 
<p>Here is the problem:</p> 
<p>The course will be designed to have 5 or 6 small teams of students in a 25 
student course who create physical, tangible products (interface prototypes) as 
a central part of the course and need to exchange them with the other student 
groups, as well as the instructor, 3 different times over the course for 
usability testing and feedback. Virtual simulations are not preferred, b/c it 
is deemed too involved to teach 3D modeling for this course and b/c the 
projects need to be touched to be evaluated.</p> 
<p>So how to coordinate the production and sharing of a physical object among 
the group members who produce it (like in a bricks&amp;mortar lab or studio), 
and then to produce multiple copies of each version of the prototype product to 
distribute to each student in other groups who could live anywhere on Earth, 
and specially package them so that each group opens them the same way and 
proper way so as not to invalidate their experience of using it.</p> 
<p>What is involved to imagine doing this in a way that doesn't involve Fedex 
delivery and the costs involved? 3D Printing is not a real option yet either.

<p>What sort of materials would you and the students be prototyping with? What 
size would the objects be? Great question.</p>  Posted 8 months ago Permalink

<p>I will inquire with the instructor (who is away on leave right now) but I 
am an instructional designer assisting him. What are the constraints that 
material and size impose as you see them?</p> 
<p>This is a fully online course and costs are an issue but so is good 
pedagogy. I'm beginning to think that for online learning exchanging physical 
objects multiple times is too problematic/cumbersome, and that designing an 
alternative learning experience is a better way to go? So my question really is 
two questions: an implicit pedagogical one and the explicit logistical one.</p>

<p>I mainly see these as potential constraints on distribution. If the 
products are fragile and/or large, than distributing them becomes much more 
difficult. If they are durable plastic, then maybe not such an issue. This is 
also a constraint on the type of studio/lab they would need access to. What 
tools, space, support would they need to actually produce the products?</p>
