<h2>Who Should Take an Online Course? </h2> <b>Some really good reasons for 
enrolling in an online course:</b>  (back to list) 
<ul> 
<li> You have a full-time job, a family, would like to get an education, and 
still have a life.</li> 
<li> Because of your work schedule, you can't take classes at regularly 
scheduled times.</li> 
<li> You are mobility impaired. </li> 
<li> You can't find or afford reliable childcare. </li> 
<li> You live too far from campus to attend classes. </li> 
<li> You are shy and hate having to speak in class. </li> 
<li> English is your second language. You read and write English reasonably 
well, but you have trouble understanding or being understood in English.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Online students must: </b> (back to list)</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Be self-starters&#151;have the maturity and motivation to work on their own
</li> 
<li> Have the necessary hardware and software</li> 
<li>Have basic computer skills</li> </ul> 
<h2> Common Misconceptions about Online Courses </h2> 
<ul> 
<li>You think that an online class will be easier than a traditional course. 
Actually, online courses are as difficult as, if not more difficult than, 
traditional courses.</li> 
<li>You think it will take less time because you won't have to sit in a 
classroom. The reality is that an online course can take as much or more time 
and effort as a traditional course.</li> 
<li>You want to learn how to use a computer or surf the web. Understand that 
you must know how to use your computer and get around on the Internet<i>before
</i> taking an online course.</li> </ul> 
<h2>The Reality of Taking an Online Course </h2> <strong>Online courses are 
not for everyone:</strong>(back to list) 
<ol> 
<li>Contrary to popular belief, online courses are just as hard and are more 
time consuming than traditional courses.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Rather than sitting in a physical classroom listening to your instructor 
lecture for 3 hours a week, you will be reading your lectures from a computer 
screen.</li> 
<li>Online courses typically require much more reading and writing than 
traditional classes.</li> 
<li>Instead of asking questions and receiving an instantaneous answer from 
your instructor, you will be either posting or e-mailing your questions. While 
most online instructors will respond to your concerns as soon as possible, you 
will need to be patient.</li> 
<li>As you will not be in the classroom, you will need to be much more 
self-directed than it might seem. In other words, you have to take 
responsibility for your own learning.</li> </ul> 
<li>Some students truly need the face-to-face interaction with instructor and 
peers.</li> 
<li>Other students find that they lack the high level of responsibility it 
takes to tackle an online class.</li> 
<li> At a minimum, an online course requires students to use their time 
wisely, be organized, be self-directed, and be willing to try new modes of 
communication and learning.</li> 
<li>Successful students often use the weekly assignment sheets to create a 
course calendar so that they have an overview of all assignments. Good time 
management and planning are necessary skills.</li> 
<li>Students who do well are those who are willing to put in the needed time, 
read the text carefully (even the dull sections), and participate in the 
discussion boards the best they can.</li> 
<li>You will be expected to check your e-mail frequently, get all assignments 
in on time, not allow yourself to fall behind at all, discuss your concerns and 
questions with instructor and classmates, perhaps arrange to swap e-mail 
addresses with other students in the class, and participate fully each week.
</li> </ol> <strong>The Best Things about Online Courses:</strong> (back to list
) 
<ol> 
<li>Flexibility - for those of you unable to attend a regularly scheduled 
course, you will not be restricted by time and place - you get to do the weekly 
coursework when and where you want to do it.</li> 
<li>The asynchronous discussions allow everyone to have his/her say on the 
issues, and students can take the time to form thoughtful and clear opinions 
before sharing them with the rest of the class.</li> 
<li>No commuting to and from college: while others are driving in inclement 
weather or running through rain and snow to make it to class, you can be warm 
and dry working from your home computer.</li> 
<li>No transportation or parking problems to worry about.</li> 
<li>No need for childcare.</li> </ol>

<h2>Tips to Ensure Online Success</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Have a back up plan.</strong> All computers eventually suffer 
failures. Have a plan in case yours goes down; know where you can find a back 
up computer in case of emergency and know how to operate its various programs. 
Back up or copy your homework onto a disk regularly.</li> 
<li><strong>Logon Frequently.</strong> You should try to log on at least once 
a day (at least five days a week and more often if possible). Develop a logon 
routine that's comfortable with your schedule. online classes tend to generate 
a large number of e-mails and web announcements. If you don't logon for a few 
days you will be overwhelmed and might have trouble catching up.</li> 
<li><strong>Respond promptly to e-mail.</strong> In the online environment you 
are invisible to the rest of the class. If you don't respond, we will think you 
didn't get the e-mail or don't want to respond. When you respond it's like 
saying, &quot;I'm here!&quot; If you can't respond immediately, at least send a 
quick note saying &quot;I received your message and will reply this 
evening.&quot;</li> 
<li><strong>Include the previous message when responding to e-mails.</strong> 
This will help the person receiving your response to refresh his or her memory 
about the original discussion. (Note: It is appropriate to include only the 
pertinent portion of the original message).</li> 
<li><strong>Don't change e-mail addresses.</strong> Changing or using 
different e-mail addresses only creates confusion and delays.</li> 
<li><strong>Identify yourself.</strong> Make sure that you sign your e-mail 
with your full name (first and last). E-mail addresses cannot always be 
associated with the name of the sender.</li> 
<li><strong>Participate.</strong> You attend the online class by 
participating. You send messages and complete assignments before the due date; 
that's how you show that you are &quot;present.&quot; If you lurk (remain 
silent) then you are &quot;absent.&quot;</li> 
<li><strong>Make your e-mail subject lines meaningful.</strong> Use something 
in the subject line header that lets the receiver know which task you're 
submitting for his or her review; the title of the assignment as your subject 
line is always good. Always identify your class by putting the class number in 
the e-mail subject line.</li> 
<li><strong>Use .rtf format for attachments.</strong> If you send an 
instructor or classmate an attachment by e-mail, convert it to text rich format 
(.rft) format before e-mailing.</li> 
<li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Double check e-mail addresses. Sending e-mail 
to the wrong address will cause the intended receiver to be cut out of the 
communication loop. If you send a URL make sure you cut and paste it in from 
the web page. Inaccurate URLs cause others to waste time trying to figure out 
why they can't get to the web page.</li> 
<li><strong>Read about the COS Library's services for distance students. 
</strong>http://www.siskiyous.edu/library/servicesdistantstudents.htm 
&nbsp;Then follow the directions to request a library card so that you can 
access the library's online databases, which includes periodicals, newspapers, 
electronic books and reference sources. Remember, you can always contact a 
reference librarian by e-mail or phone for assistance in using the databases or 
help with research assignments.</li> 
<li><strong>Flexibility and calm.</strong> These are the hallmark of 
successful online classroom experiences. Problems will arise and when they do, 
the ability to remain calm and be flexible in your thinking will keep them from 
becoming unmanageable. Don' t panic; if you don't get an answer to your pleas 
for help right away, remain calm, wait 24 hours and if you still haven't 
resolved your problem or gotten help, send me a message with the words 
&quot;URGENT HELP&quot; in the subject line. Instructors usually check e-mail 
each day, but they can also receive several a hundred e-mails in a week, so if 
your urgent message is not answered within 24-48 hours e-mail your instructor 
again.</li> 
<li><strong>Pay attention to deadlines.</strong> When you don't get your 
assignments in on time it causes other students who need to read and comment on 
your work to also be late in their work.</li> 
<li><strong>Netiquette.</strong> Because the student and instructor can't see 
each other they lose much of the ability to read between the lines in our 
online communications. Without facial expressions and body language the written 
word can easily be misinterpreted. The use of smiley's is a good way to provide 
insight of your intent when composing e-mails. Look over the suggestions at:
Wikipedia - Netiquette and Wikipedia - Emoticon. </li> 
<li><strong>Don't Flame.</strong> The purpose of class discussion boards is to 
learn from one another and hopefully gain an appreciation of another point of 
view. We all need to show respect for one another's opinions and be sensitive 
in our comments. If you receive an upsetting message, wait to respond for at 
least 24 hours. Waiting before responding, will allow everyone to cool off and 
rethink the wisdom of sending their first response. Verbal attacks (flaming) is 
not be tolerated. Let your instructor know if you feel you have been verbally 
abused by a classmate.</li> 
<li><strong>Make meaningful comments.</strong> During the semester you will 
likely be commenting on one another's work. Think of this as a chance to help 
one another. Meaningful comments will be appreciated by your classmates. Avoid 
comments like &quot;Good ideas.&quot; Instead, list specific points that you 
thought were good, and suggest ways that the person can improve.</li> 
<li><strong>Read and print out course &quot;first day&quot; information.
</strong> Be sure you understand all course policies, know how you will be 
graded and are aware of important due dates.<br>
