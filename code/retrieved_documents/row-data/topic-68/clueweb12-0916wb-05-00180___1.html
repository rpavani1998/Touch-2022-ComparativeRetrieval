<h2>Horizontal Tabs</h2> Overview 
<p>Learn the essential components of designing effective online courses.</p> 
<p>As the demand for high-quality online courses and programs rapidly 
increases, instructional designers and course developers are faced with a new 
set of challenges. Special considerations are required to ensure the 
development of effective courses and a high level of engagement for a variety 
of learners.</p> 
<p>Join us for a unique experience to examine steps to design effective online 
courses. In four sessions, we will cover remapping your course, organizing 
content, using Web 2.0 technology, and integrating learning design. We will 
also walk you through a step-by-step process to transform a face-to-face course 
to an online delivery format. Between sessions, you will have the chance to 
practice this process using one of your own courses.</p> 
<h2>WHO SHOULD ATTEND</h2> 
<p>Instructional designers, course developers, instructional technologists, 
and faculty charged with the design of online courses will benefit from this 
course.</p> 
<h2>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h2> 
<p>You will learn how to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use instructional redesign strategies for online courses</li> 
<li>Organize content into instructional modules</li> 
<li>Align course objectives, activities, and assessments</li> 
<li>Intentionally develop instructional activities that are interactive and 
engaging</li> 
<li>Select appropriate technology to support instructional objectives</li> 
</ul> 
<h5>HOW IS THIS ONLINE COURSE DIFFERENT FROM A STANDARD WEBCAST?</h5> 
<p>The Academic Impressions online course format differs from our traditional 
webcasts in that it offers content, networking, and activities for one group of 
learners over a longer period of time. This format is right for you if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You desire the intensity, depth, and interaction of a face-to-face 
conference format but wish to complete many of the components on your own time 
and at your own pace.</li> 
<li>You desire one-on-one interaction with course instructors and other course 
participants.</li> 
<li>You want to create a signature project as part of the course that will 
directly apply to the goals you are working to achieve on your campus.</li> 
<li>You work well in a format where a portion of the work is self-directed.
</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>COURSE FORMAT AND SIGNATURE PROJECT</h2> 
<p>This four-part program uses a blend of synchronous and asynchronous 
components to model an effective online course.<strong>During the synchronous 
sessions,</strong> you will be invited to contribute ideas, make decisions, and 
ask questions about the course (re)design process.</p> 
<p><strong>Between sessions,</strong> you will have the opportunity to 
practice the process through the creation of a signature project that is 
specific to your work and your institutional setting. Your project for this 
course will involve converting components of one of your own face-to-face 
courses to the online format. You will complete this project in phases over the 
duration of the course, and you will receive feedback on the project from 
course instructors and participants.</p> 
<p><strong>To ensure maximum interactivity and personal attention, enrollment 
will be limited. Take advantage of this unique opportunity while space is still 
available!</strong></p>

<h3> Sonja Lanehart </h3> 
<p> Professor and Brackenridge Endowed Chair in Literature and the Humanities, 
University of Texas, San Antonio</p> &ldquo; 
<p>This four-part webinar course was informative, collaborative, and 
structured very well for the time blocks. Our group was challenged and we 
enjoyed the topics each session. The variety of materials, speakers, and 
activities and resources was effective and enjoyable. For a difficult and 
challenging course topic, the presenters encouraged questions and were very 
helpful with their answers.</p> &rdquo; <br>

<h3> Laura Sederberg </h3> 
<p> Manager of the Technology and Learning Program, CSU, Chico </p> &ldquo; 
<p>This event was very deliberate and thoughtful. Really thought-provoking. 
Going through the levels always gives an ID an 'aha!' moment and that, to me, 
was very stimulating.</p> &rdquo; <br>
