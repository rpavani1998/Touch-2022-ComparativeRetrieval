<p>Today we have a guest post from Robert Williams, which is all about online 
learning.&nbsp; Enjoy!<br>
<br>
The advancement of internet technology in the 
present decade brought about a revolutionary change in the educational world, 
especially in the distance-learning sector. The concept of learning via 
distance by going online went a step ahead in being more flexible and 
accessible to the learners. Now, since, it is all about connecting the student, 
the instructor, and the content over a virtual setting embraced with 
technologies independent of&nbsp; time and distance, proper understanding of 
the tech-tools in use if utmost importance. When it comes to delivering 
knowledge through distance learning courses, the online way, a mutual 
understanding needs to develop for effective learning.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Keeping this need in mind, a number of colleges and universities worldwide 
have introduced technological training courses for catering to the needs of 
both online instructor and learners. Implementing some online teaching ideas 
work as an advanced help for the instructors alongside his or her skill of the 
technologies in use in online classes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Teacher-Student Relation
</strong><br>
<br>
Every online instructor should look into the prospects of 
building a good relation with students enrolled for distance learning courses. 
This should in fact be a priority with every instructor, as students new into 
the mould of this learning environment might face challenges adapting to the 
learning methods. Responding to the varied queries and guiding them out of the 
apprehension stand as your duty. Students should always feel free to consult 
you in times of difficulty. Always maintain a friendly approach towards every 
student instilling the support strength in them.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Teacher-Student Communication</strong><br>
<br>
Letting your students know 
about the course requirement, the next assignment date, and learning schedule 
also stands as one of the favorable online teaching ideas. Since, your student 
is balancing his studies and other personal or professional commitments, it is 
essential for you to extend the helping hand in his or her support. Encourage 
your student to log onto the class, as it allows better learning. Generating an 
interest for attending video conferences and participating in chat discussion 
boards also stand important in gaining success with online learning.<br>
<br>

<strong>Teacher-Student Understanding</strong><br>
<br>
Do not let any learner 
take distance learning courses lightly. Since, they incorporate a touch of 
flexibility; many online students tend to take the approach lightly. Initiating 
a physical classroom feel even in the virtual setting stands as the next 
important task for every online instructor. Encourage your students to involve 
in peer interaction, as it fosters better learning. Excite your students to 
post topic-related discussions and act as connect in channelizing their ideas 
into practical implementation or next theoretical assignment.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Teacher-Student Advice<br>
</strong><br>
Last but not the least, effective 
online teaching ideas in perspective of distance learning courses always 
include providing detailed feedback to the learner on his or her learning 
growth. The habit of offering feedback should be maintained all through the 
course term for instilling a sense of self-confidence among the learners. Be 
positive will offering your feedback and let him or her know politely about the 
areas of improvement that can lead him to be a better learner. Be a friend and 
guide to the online students rather, than maintaining a strict teacher-like 
approach.<br>
<br>
Be a master in applying these strategies and you can turn 
out to be an efficient online instructor, helping your students experience a 
swift transition into the online learning mode.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
