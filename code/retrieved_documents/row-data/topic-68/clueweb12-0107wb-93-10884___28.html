<ul> 
<li>To remain fresh and relevant, online courses need to be continually 
revised and improved.</li> 
<li>Considerations of relevant laws and institutional policies should be a 
core focus of every curriculum redesign.</li> 
<li>Redesigning an online curriculum presents rich opportunities to integrate 
the latest thinking in given disciplines and to incorporate new methodologies 
for teaching and learning.</li> 
<li>New, emerging, and evolving technologies can greatly enhance work to 
update the curriculum of an online course.</li> </ul> 
<p>A well-designed curriculum for online learning nurtures both student 
learning and student retention. While ideally value will be designed into an 
online curriculum from the start, the reality is that, across the spectrum of 
e-learning, there is a wide range of quality. Consequently, virtually every 
online course can benefit from periodic curricular updates.</p> 
<p>Once online courses are developed and implemented, however, their 
curriculum might not be changed or updated for some time, if ever. When it does 
take place, curricular redesign tends to focus on particulars rather than the 
big picture. Rarely do we step back to fundamentally assess the raison d'etre 
for a given curriculum &mdash; to examine the essential cultural factors that 
undergird that curriculum and the purposes for which it was created.1 Analyses 
at that level have great potential to enrich a curriculum. In addition, 
curricular updates can introduce important new content, and may also introduce 
pedagogical enhancements that can improve the quality of e-learning.</p> 
<p>In this context, this article presents ideas for an approach based in the 
principles of instructional design to updating the curriculum for online 
courses. Tools from that realm &mdash; including establishing processes for 
effective online learning, templating digital learning objects and modules for 
quality, defining clear work flows and decision junctures, adhering to 
standards of legality and ethics, and applying wise leadership and project 
management&mdash;offer a powerful approach to the development and refinement of 
quality curricula.</p> 
<h2>A Four-Fold Approach for Updating an Online Curriculum</h2> 
<p>A variety of factors can impede or preclude substantive updates in course 
content, including a lack of dedicated resources (budget, time, expertise); a 
lack of political will at the administrative level; inertia on the part of 
those who first developed the curriculum; and a protectionist attitude toward 
the existing course on the part of the course developers.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, many forces can stimulate a curricular update, including 
the availability of external or internal grant funds, a push from 
administrators for higher course quality, an impending visit by an 
accreditation team, or the emergence of the need for a new degree or program 
that builds on the substructure inherent in existing courses.</p> 
<p>Once the decision to revise a curriculum is made, faculty and subject 
matter experts need to ask themselves four central questions:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Have legal guidelines and relevant policies that might affect the course 
revision changed?</li> 
<li>What progress or change in the domain field might inform the course 
revision?</li> 
<li>What updates in teaching and learning methodologies might be relevant?</li>
<li>What updates in relevant technologies could improve the course?</li> </ol> 
<p>Coupled with these primary considerations should be an assessment of 
whether the individual interested in revising the course has the time and 
skills to do so effectively, and whether there is adequate institutional 
support for making the right changes to the curriculum.</p> 
<p>While different workplace contexts might emphasize these factors 
differently, and while many may include additional areas for update, answers to 
these questions are likely to have the greatest impacts on learning and the 
fundamental quality of the curriculum. Figure 1 shows this conceptualization.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 1. A Four-Fold Approach for Updating an Online Curriculum
</strong></p> 
<p>Why are these four questions important? An online learning experience that 
adheres to legal principles will uphold the reputation of the university and 
protect the rights of students. An online course curriculum that reflects the 
instructor's ability to stay current with research and developments in a 
particular discipline, perhaps in tandem with relevant interdisciplinary 
knowledge, will enhance learning by ensuring that students have the most 
current and relevant information. Applying the latest pedagogical methods can 
enhance the online learning experience. Targeting curriculum for different 
learning needs &mdash; including different developmental phases, different 
primary languages, and different learning contexts (cultural, geographical, 
social, political, technological, and domain field) &mdash; can enhance both 
individual and group learning experiences. The use of the latest relevant 
technologies for lecture capture, synchronous interactivity, simulations, 
student interactivity and intercommunications, student group work, research, 
design, and other learning activities can all improve the learner experience.
</p> 
<p>The draft checklist for updating an online curriculum that accompanies this 
article expands on the four questions/areas. Other readily available 
guidelines, such as theQuality Matters rubric, also provide valuable reality 
checks that can help inform a curricular redesign effort.</p> 
<h2>Updated Legal Guidelines and Relevant Policies</h2> 
<p>Curriculum revision requires careful attention to legal requirements and 
relevant institutional policies. Faculty adherence to the law can help keep 
legal liabilities for both the institution and the respective faculty member in 
check.</p> 
<p>The legal dimensions of curriculum redesign include three key areas:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ownership of intellectual property</li> 
<li>Accessibility of online learning</li> 
<li>Learner privacy rights</li> </ul> 
<h3>Intellectual Property Protections</h3> 
<p>Any use of copyrighted text, images, videos, audio, or other content in an 
online course brings Intellectual property considerations into play. Given that 
de facto copyright ownership pertains once creative content has been put into 
fixed form, virtually anything created during the past few generations is 
automatically given copyright protections (unless that material is explicitly 
released by contract).Fair use exemptions and the TEACH Act (and its 
implications fordistance education) allow very narrow uses of some small parts 
of copyrighted materials. Faculty members have other pathways to content: They 
can create their own content; use content released to the public domain; access 
open-source (and royalty-free) resources; or use content released through 
variousCreative Commons licenses. Another option, of course, is to do without. 
Apart from those legitimate avenues, course developers are sometimes tempted to 
take decidedly riskier and ill-advised routes, swiping content off the World 
Wide Web without checking the content's provenance, ownership, or rights 
protection. Worse yet, developers might bypass digital rights management (DRM) 
protections around certain works in order to build their online learning 
collection.</p> 
<p>Students have intellectual property rights to much of the work that they 
create in an academic course &mdash; including partial rights to co-developed 
works created by a student team. Before student-created works are used for 
future courses, publications, or other similar applications, faculty members 
and administrators need to ensure that students officially release their rights 
for those purposes in writing.</p> 
<p>Commercialization of a curriculum raises its own legal issues, which are 
often further complicated because commercialization of a curriculum often 
requires that it be changed substantively. An academic course becomes a 
commercial work once it is used as part of a profit-making venture, outside the 
bounds of the umbrella implicit in an institution's nonprofit status. Once a 
work goes commercial, academic exemptions to copyright no longer apply. That 
means that a massive retrofitting will be required. Any works used under fair 
use will have to be removed. Works used with the permissions of third-party 
content providers (often contingent on learners using particular purchased 
textbooks) will likely need to be removed. There may be contractual challenges 
with a faculty member who is taking a curriculum commercial if he or she was 
paid to create the work for an accredited nonprofit institution of higher 
education.</p> 
<p>Another complication arises when student work is involved. Students in many 
academic, design, and research-based courses will originate new ideas, lines of 
research, and innovations that have research and development implications. 
Works created in classes may fall under &quot;fair use&quot; in terms of the 
materials used in the student papers, portfolios, designs, drawings, and 
multimedia &mdash; but those works cannot be used under &quot;fair use&quot; if 
students are using the works for out-of-classroom purposes.</p> 
<p>Figure 2 shows how, at &quot;five after,&quot; student work has already 
left the classroom and has potential commercial applications &mdash; thus often 
changing student rights to use particular copyrighted materials. Instructors 
need to help students understand the legal issues implicit in their work and 
keep within the law as constructive contributors in their respective fields.</p>
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 2. The Life Cycle of Student Work</strong></p> 
<h3>Accessibility of Online Learning</h3> 
<p>Yet another legal issue concerns online accessibility. In this context, 
this means the ability of people with a range of different types of abilities, 
including those with visual acuity, sound acuity, mobility, and symbolic 
processing challenges, to access an online course and curriculum. The 
fundamental concern is how well curricula are developed to accommodate such 
users.</p> 
<p>Available technologies enable developers to include alt (alternative) text 
for imagery, as well as transcription and captioning for audios, narrated 
slideshows, videos, and simulations, and to build accessible learning objects. 
A wide range of guidelines describe how to build digital tables in a way that 
is machine-readable using text readers. Courses built with federal and state 
funds are often required to be fully accessible perSection 508 and other 
applicable accessibility standards.</p> 
<p>In making work accessible, subject matter experts focus on making sure that 
the informational value of the images and other digital elements is equal for 
all users. The process also involves instructional design (how the online 
learning experience is conceptualized and created) and development/scripting 
work (how the digital materials are created) to ensure that the digital 
learning objects fully comply with accessibility requirements.</p> 
<h3>Learner Privacy Rights</h3> 
<p>A final concern focuses on the privacy rights of learners. Through the 
Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have privacy rights 
that protect much of their non-directory types of information. Private 
academic, health, and other student information may not be publicly shared.</p> 
<p>Because students have a right to their own image and voice, they need to 
sign releases before a class can be captured on video, audio, or even in still 
images. The releases must be specific about what the learners are releasing and 
must delimit how digital captures may be used (in future online courses as 
student work samples, in publicity materials, in a broadcast digital 
video-sharing site, or on a course-related CD or DVD).</p> 
<p>To understand the nuances of handling property rights appropriately in a 
classroom situation, consider the case of a professor teaching a class on 
weather and flight. His educational resources include slideshows and images 
illustrating his lectures, with materials pulled from multiple online sources. 
To explore his options, see &quot;Modeling Proper Handling of Intellectual 
Property.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Progress and Change in Domain Fields</h2> 
<p>Informed by a constant stream of new research and information, domain 
fields change constantly. This is especially noticeable in research 
institutions that emphasize applied and theoretical research. Here, instructors 
are valued not only for their support of learners but for their contributions 
of new learning through their own work, their collaborations with colleagues, 
and student research under their tutelage.</p> 
<p>Domain fields often undergo true paradigm shifts, in which central concepts 
of the past are superseded by more nuanced understandings based on empirical 
research, quantitative and qualitative and mixed methods research, and 
high-level meta-analyses. Similarly, practices within domains can change, in 
both research and applications in the field. Different research frameworks may 
be applied. New informational data sets may become available, and more online 
resources may be released into the public domain.<br>
 New thinking could lead 
to changes in what is considered ethical in a particular field. The field's 
original set of ethics might have been derived from often competing interests, 
such as standards of the profession, a professional code of ethics, ethics of 
the community, personal codes of ethics, and individual professional codes.2</p>
<p>As the realities of a field evolve, they can have reverberating impacts. 
Changes in fields that are peripheral to a specific discipline often have 
impacts in a main area of study. Conversant knowledge in those peripheral 
fields will be necessary. Figure 3 shows these mixes of interrelationships.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 3. The Interrelationships Between Domain-Field Elements That 
Affect a Curriculum</strong></p> 
<p>Given the reality of ongoing, often significant change in domain fields, it 
is imperative that faculty members stay apprised of the discoveries in their 
particular areas of expertise &mdash; certainly in the general interest of 
building new knowledge, but also in revising the curriculum for an online 
course.</p> 
<p>To explore the complexity of working across disciplines in developing a 
course for geographically diverse learners, see &quot;Collaborations Across 
Institutions and Disciplines&quot; describing development of a public health 
course.</p> 
<h2>Updates in Teaching and Learning Methodologies</h2> 
<p>While some instructors might consider a course design complete once the 
course has been created, periodic or even regular updates can greatly enrich a 
course. This is certainly true of course content. Because they work within a 
componentized environment, course designers have considerable flexibility in 
reworking the modular curriculum and can switch content in and out at will. In 
addition, the flexibility of online course design enables faculty members to 
update teaching and learning methodologies.</p> 
<h3>E-learning Path or Trajectory</h3> 
<p>A core challenge in an online curriculum is to create a coherent e-learning 
path or trajectory, particularly for online learning deployed through multiple 
technologies or a learning/course management system. The more complex the 
content, the more diverse the learner skill sets, and the more divergent the 
preferred modes of learning, the harder it is to create a coherent sense of a 
singular path. Related learning content needs to be clearly labeled with 
consistent semantics, and these ought to be co-located in the same area in the 
online classroom.</p> 
<p>A course trajectory may be built on an informational structure that shows a 
clear progression of learning and ensures that learners have the information 
they need at a particular time. A trajectory helps learners get a sense of 
where they are in the curriculum, where they're going, and where they've been, 
at any time in a course. A newer type of learning path involves a 
story-centered curriculum, which tells a story with critical dramatic learning 
points along the way. To enrich the learning experience, &quot;digital 
storytelling&quot; involves the creation of narratives and shared experiences 
using multimedia.3 Figure 4 outlines one approach to a course trajectory, a 
course folder structure from the Introduction to Public Health course. The 
figure shows the overall course trajectory in a developmental and modular 
structure.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 4. Screenshot of the Top-level Folder Structure of 
Introduction to Public Health</strong></p> 
<p>A course retrofit should include an analysis of the learner experience as 
well as a review of the content segment by segment. The sequentiality of the 
learning needs to be clear. Segues between modules, courses (in a degree 
program), or sequences add coherence for learners, connecting students more 
directly with the content and enriching learning. The learning sequence needs 
to make developmental sense: Foundational knowledge should be addressed first, 
followed by discussions of more complex content.</p> 
<p>Typical sequences involve an early social &quot;icebreaker&quot; to help 
online learners connect with each other and with the instructor. Often an early 
assignment introduces the course and encourages learners to share their 
hypotheses of where the course might be headed. It can also reveal students' 
expectations about the course materials, enabling the instructor to address 
misperceptions. Other components might include a review of course standards and 
policies and the sharing of learning tips. The instructor might address his or 
her pedagogical strategies and course expectations. Successful early 
assignments help build online learner efficacy.</p> 
<p>Many online courses also use a certain &quot;glamour appeal&quot; to 
attract learners. Courses might include such assignments as the creation of a 
faux history for a criminology class, role-playing global interrelationships 
for a political science course, preparation of a feast for a nutrition class, 
or creation of a simple digital game for a computer science course. Course 
attractions could also involve trips abroad, participation in professional 
conferences, fieldwork, and other inducements.</p> 
<h3>Focusing on Learner-Centered Curriculums and Experiences</h3> 
<p>A curriculum should be calibrated to the particular developmental levels of 
its students. Gaps in knowledge, skills, and or learner preparation &mdash; 
problems that occur with more frequency given today's high drop-out rates in 
high schools and college &mdash; need to be addressed with remedial work, 
support, and well-presented information. The course designer should clearly 
define the e-learning trajectory and pacing and properly design them for the 
particular levels of learners.</p> 
<p>Also important is the human-facilitated capability of adjusting a 
curriculum to meet the unique needs of a range of online learners. One of the 
implications of &quot;scaffolding&quot; learning is to build structures that 
enable learners to achieve learning that they wouldn't otherwise. Scaffolding 
can effectively help a range of learners remain engaged. It can be used, for 
example, with student &quot;outliers,&quot; such as the novice (a learner who 
is inexperienced and na&iuml;ve but aims to become expert in a particular 
field) and the amateur (a na&iuml;ve learner who seeks only a surface 
understanding of a particular field and does not aim for future expertise). The 
scaffolding concept can also effectively enhance learning for expert outliers 
at the other end of the bell curve of learners, perhaps through the study of 
more advanced research topics. Figure 5 shows the conceptualization of the 
minority outliers on a bell curve, with novices and amateurs at one end and 
expert outliers at the other.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 5. Scaffolding Learning for the Outliers: Novices and 
Amateurs, and Experts</strong></p> 
<p>One recent trend in curriculum design has been toward a &quot;contributing 
student pedagogy,&quot; in which learners contribute to each other's learning 
and value the contributions of peers. This approach has reformulated the 
instructor-learner power structure by emphasizing the importance of learner 
choices, attitudes, and voices. The contributing student pedagogy also focuses 
on building &quot;increased content understanding, improved generic skills, 
increased motivation, increased satisfaction, increased confidence, (and) 
improved social skills&quot; &mdash; all of which contribute to learner 
retention.4</p> 
<p>Instructors might also design opt-in resources for students who seek 
assistance. Tutorial systems sometimes feature animated intelligent avatars to 
interact with learners. Some of these resources provide opt-in, 
context-sensitive help, such as directions for using a learning/course 
management system or a certain software program. For human-facilitated courses, 
instructors also make themselves more widely available to support student 
learning by providing information, access to resources, constructive critiques, 
and rich learning opportunities.</p> 
<p>As online curriculums reach wider audiences, more retrofitting might be 
necessary to ensure that particular learning sequences are tailored to 
particular learners and the cultural environments in which the learning content 
will be used. Curriculums might need redesigns to be more inclusive, 
particularly of groups whose voices have not always been fully heard,5 even 
requiring translation of content into different languages. A curriculum might 
require tailoring content to a particular context, whether cultural, 
geographical, social, political, technological, or specific to a domain field. 
To accommodate a diversity of learners with different learning preferences and 
styles &mdash; such as kinesthetic/tactile, auditory/visual, 
logical/mathematical, musical/rhythmic, verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial, and 
interpersonal/intrapersonal &mdash; might require diversifying assessments to 
include a wider range of formative and summative measurements. Many assessments 
that are effective in the face-to-face classroom also work well in the online 
classroom.6</p> 
<p>There are many ways to create value-added learning for online studies. Some 
faculty use case studies to enliven discussion and show how theories apply in 
real-world situations. Games, simulations, and immersive learning can 
contextualize the learning (to enhance &quot;situated cognition&quot;). The 
uses of role plays in these situations enable learners to empathize with 
certain roles and to view strategic interplays of various entities in a system. 
Games may evoke more positive emotions in learners toward the subject matter.7 
Informational structures and ontologies help learners form mental models of 
dynamic interrelationships and systems.</p> 
<p>In higher level courses, problem-based learning can be effective. The 
instructor can include examples that have no apparent solution, even for 
subject matter experts, or where the &quot;answer&quot; involves complex, 
open-ended designs with varying and competing degrees of appropriateness for 
the context (as, for example, in land-use proposals in the context of landscape 
architecture). Project-based learning can encourage students to engage in 
unwieldy projects, either alone, in pairs, or as part of multidisciplinary 
teams.</p> 
<p>Some programs use undergraduate research as a means to increase student 
retention and help them bridge to graduate-level learning.8 Cumulative 
activities such as e-portfolio building support student reflection on their 
learning, provide a vehicle for students to receive feedback from experts, and 
enhance peer learning. Students may create rich works for digital gallery 
shows, or they might conduct research and write up their findings in 
integrative papers. Students can push the edges of the academic and outside 
worlds by engaging in professional or amateur competitions, apprenticeships, 
service learning, and work-study endeavors. Table 1 shows three main types of 
learning, from basic informational learning to learning acquired through 
applied skills and conceptual domain-level modeling and innovations.</p> 
<p><strong>Table 1. A Simple Conceptualization of Types of Higher Education 
Learning</strong></p> <strong>1. Informational Learning</strong><br>
 This 
level of learning is the type conveyed in survey and introductory courses. 
Students learn by rote memorization and practice and study. This initial level 
of learning sets the groundwork of understandings in a field. <strong>2. 
Applied Skills</strong><br>
 This level of learning is often used in higher 
level courses. Hands-on practice may be done via simulations, digital wet labs, 
role plays, and virtual immersive spaces. Students may also apply skills in 
apprenticeships out in the community, in service learning (whether locally, 
domestically or abroad), fieldwork, and field research. <strong>3. Conceptual 
Domain-Level Modeling and Innovations</strong><br>
 This domain-level of 
mastery results in expert-level analysis and expert-level knowledge of 
interrelationships in a particular field. This suggests a powerful ability to 
analyze problems and troubleshoot them in a live situation. It also suggests 
the ability to conceptualize new research and to carry through that research to 
fruition and to contribute new knowledge to the field. <br>

<br>

<h3>The Social Interactivity Layer</h3> 
<p>As student-centered learning continues to supplant instructor-centered 
learning, many instructors are retrofitting their courses for more planned 
intercommunications, interactivity, and collaborations between learners.9 
Various methods of student community-building in distance courses enhance a 
sense of interactivity and promote learner retention.10 The scaffolding of 
learner interactivity supports learner retention and may combat &quot;feelings 
of isolation, lack of self-direction and management, and (an) eventual decrease 
in motivation levels.&quot;11 In this model, learners work on shared 
independent projects. Peer learners give feedback and support each other's 
learning. Students form professional networks and personal friendships.</p> 
<p>Participation and interactions with learners in an online classroom help 
create a stronger telepresence, or sense of &quot;being&quot; in the classroom, 
on the part of the instructor. Researchers have found that such a presence 
enhances the learning experience but does not have a direct effect on 
&quot;perceived learning, satisfaction, engagement, or the quality of their 
final course product.&quot;12 Other researchers have found that direct personal 
attention may relieve adult anxieties about school and increase learner 
retention.13</p> 
<p>Some instructors plan synchronous events &mdash; with guest speakers, 
complex role plays in virtual worlds, and cross-institutional learning 
exchanges &mdash; to enhance the value of the learning. Others create blended 
experiences for learning, with students meeting in physical spaces for field 
trips and experiments. Encouraging interrelationships between learners helps 
improve student retention and degree completion rates. Students who take 
courses with peers often are more motivated and committed to continue in their 
learning.</p> 
<p>The educational research literature includes many important findings about 
what is effective for online teaching and learning. Some fundamental works 
include Ruth Colvin Clark and Richard E. Mayer's<em>E-Learning and the Science 
of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia 
Learning</em> (2nd edition), and Clark Aldrich's <em>Learning Online with 
Games, Simulations, and Virtual Worlds: Strategies for Online Learning</em> and 
<em>Learning by Doing: A Comprehensive Guide to Simulations, Computer Games, 
and Pedagogy in E-Learning and Other Educational Experiences</em>.</p> 
<p>A team built a virtual space in Second Life to demonstrate the adaptations 
possible to meet the needs of people with disabilities. To explore the options 
and limitations of virtual inclusiveness, see &quot;Inclusiveness in a Virtual 
World.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Relevant Updated Technologies</h2> 
<p>Many distributed learning courses become dated essentially as soon as they 
launch. Courses can become dated by virtue of the authoring tools used to 
create their content, including text files, the slideshows, the audio, the 
imagery, and the video. Similarly, they can become dated by virtue of changes 
in their learning/course management system, web browser, media player, virtual 
world space, or related elements and layers of the technological dependencies 
required for online learning. This aging-out of content also occurs as a 
byproduct of the ongoing push to develop new technological and pedagogical 
methods. The speed of change will leave behind those who do not move with the 
technological current.</p> 
<p>New generations of online learners have learned to expect regular rollouts 
of newer, better, and faster levels of technological expertise. What is 
innovative and new in a curriculum today becomes simply the baseline 
expectation of new generations of learners. Everyday exposure to sophisticated 
production values in multimedia applications creates expectations among 
students that online courses will have similar production values; anything less 
can draw negative responses about the course as a whole.</p> 
<p>The availability of camcorders, digital cameras, scanners, 
microscope-mounted cameras, digital microphones, and desktop lecture-capture 
software enables virtually anyone to become a producer of digital content. 
Digital content can be edited at one's desktop through video editing, image 
editing, and sound editing software. These relatively new technologies enable 
students to represent ideas in different formats, which enhances their deep 
learning along both visual/spatial and auditory/verbal information channels.14 
Material that originated in digital form can be readily deployed in online 
immersive sites or on different platforms. The scalability of some of these 
online experiences can help learning experiences feel more personal and 
intimate, particularly in larger sections of courses where direct one-on-one 
interaction with the instructor is rare.</p> 
<p>The true total cost of ownership of online learning materials is high if 
one does an actual accounting that factors in all the costs associated with the 
countless elements that typically contribute to a curriculum, from information 
technologies staff and faculty to the costs of wired infrastructure, hardware, 
software, security, subscriptions to data repositories, maintenance of digital 
labs, funding for curriculum development and maintenance, and so on. The 
reality is that e-learning is predicated on layers of technological and human 
resources dependencies.</p> 
<p>In terms of relevant technologies, most course or instructional designers 
need to consider two main elements, maintenance and value-added. Maintenance 
refers to a kind of digital preservation of online learning content; 
value-added refers to the enrichment of the online learning experience.</p> 
<p>Maintenance means ensuring that digital content is preserved against 
obsolescence and the &quot;slow fires&quot; that degrade technological content. 
The informational value of learning materials must be preserved over time. The 
materials need to be accessible, and both deliverable by a university and 
receivable by its learners. Digital rights must be preserved, as must metadata 
about the objects. The content has to be portable between technological 
systems. The integrity of digital content must be maintained in all its 
incarnations, no matter the platform used. Digital labs, simulations, and 
immersive experiences need to function as scripted.</p> 
<p>By contrast, value-added technological updates involve the uses of 
high-tech resources to enhance learning experiences. Many forms of digital 
content, such as images, audio, videos, simulations, and games, have been 
rendered in digital form and made available through many technology structures, 
including digital repositories and libraries. They might include interviews, 
simulations, role plays, interactive spaces, photo collections, and other types 
of files. From the value perspective, the selection of instructional 
technologies depends on a robust assessment of learning needs.15</p> 
<p>Technological advancements also affect the types of tools used for 
learning. Popular ones for information aggregation and sharing include wikis, 
web logs or blogs (including in-the-cloud solutions), 140-character long 
microblog entries, social networking sites (for identity management, 
socializing, real-time information-sharing, and co-learning), and content 
sharing sites (for videos and digital imagery). Course content now often needs 
to be deployable on mobile devices. Virtual worlds enable the creation of 
discovery learning spaces; they also enable live simulations with other 
human-embodied avatars for different social scenarios and digital dramaturgy. 
Haptic devices (in direct-manipulation animation) have been integrated with 3D 
virtual spaces for a more full-sensory experience. Other learning may occur in 
augmented physical spaces (&quot;mixed reality&quot;), with digital 
installations built for immersive experiences that take advantage of 
proprioception and muscle memory.</p> 
<p>A grain science instructor had used a paper-bound book with samples of 
grain, which restricted use to relatively few students and required a great 
deal of labor to maintain. Conversion of the original to an e-book made the 
material more accessible to students, as explained in &quot;A Grain Science 
E-Book.&quot;</p> 
<p>To explore the additional issues involved in successful redesign of an 
online course curriculum, see &quot;Further Considerations for Curricular 
Updates.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p>Updating an e-learning course, whether through modest tweaks or a total 
overhaul, can help make a course more competitive, memorable, and effective. 
This article suggests four main foci for online course updates and retrofitting:
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The course's adherence to legal guidelines and relevant policies</li> 
<li>The course's information quality and timeliness, and domain-based digital 
content</li> 
<li>The course's curricular strategies, and online teaching and learning 
methodologies</li> 
<li>Relevant updated technologies that might help refine the course</li> </ol> 
<p>Changes do not have to be made all at once. In practice, they may occur in 
a piecemeal way. All changes should be implemented, though, within the limits 
of the documents authorizing the course and the authorizing environment. 
Locally, the limitations of political will, budget, time, and expertise will 
all have an effect. Given the breadth of the four areas, one faculty member 
will probably not be able to engage the issues of laws and policies, 
information quality, curricular strategies, and updated technologies; ideally, 
a healthy institution of higher education will have support offices that 
provide a range of course design support services to faculty along with subject 
matter experts, perhaps as part of ad hoc teams.</p> 
<p>These four broad areas are not comprehensive listings for online course 
updating. At the macro level, changes may be made to the superstructures 
outside of a class to enhance its value by linking it to a sequence of learning 
or a powerful applied learning context (service learning or study abroad 
programs are good examples). Cross-cultural alliances between institutions can 
lead to richer learning. Courses could be linked to external repositories of 
digital resources, add-on functionalities (such as e-portfolios and galleries), 
and immersive worlds to add learning value. Learners may participate in 
professional online conferences and digital poster sessions. At the micro 
level, unique changes to a course &mdash; such as the inclusion of guest 
speakers with plenty of real-world experiences, multi-language accommodations, 
or the inclusion of original student work samples &mdash; would improve the 
learner experience. Each course redesign will have its own considerations and 
require tailoring to meet the specific situation.</p> 
<p>Effective updating of course curriculums to support and engage learners 
will encourage their persistence in the course and ultimately in their program 
of study, promoting degree attainment. Vincent Tinto noted that there are five 
conditions16 for learner retention:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Expectation</li> 
<li>Advice</li> 
<li>Support</li> 
<li>Involvement</li> 
<li>Learning</li> </ul> 
<p>As Tinto wrote, &quot;Learning has always been the key to student 
retention. Students who learn are students who stay.&quot;17 Learner successes 
in learning, course by course, are a critical building block to their 
persistence. Updating online curriculums &mdash; whether through tweaks or 
paradigm shifts &mdash; offers a key way to increase learner retention and 
success.</p>

<h2>Further Considerations for Curricular Updates</h2> 
<p>Depending on organizational priorities, online course curricular updates 
may occur at various intervals. Some of these updates deal with issues of 
maintenance, while others derive from a desire to improve value-added learning. 
The following table differentiates between updates needed for every term, each 
academic year, as needed.</p>

<p>The add-on of tech-intensive learner experiences</p> 
<p>The uses of a richer array of tech-enabled research streams (as 
relevant)&hellip;such as with remote sensing, geographical information systems, 
digital repositories and referatories (like theMultimedia Educational Resource 
for Learning and Online Teaching from MERLOT), and so on</p> 
<p>The addition of metadata to learning objects for findability and accurate 
labeling</p> <br>
<br>

<p>In addition to the many dimensions of curriculum redesign already 
discussed, several other considerations merit brief mention.</p> 
<h3>Instructor Inheritance of an Online Curriculum</h3> 
<p>Many online courses, modules, and digital learning objects are not built 
with instructor inheritance in mind. &quot;Inheritance&quot; refers to the 
acceptance of the curriculum by other faculty who will teach to the established 
and formal standards of that course, module, or learning object. Instructor 
manuals rarely accompany such courses. The assumption is that experts in the 
field will be able to intuit the curriculum creator's intentions through the 
course's syllabus, assignments, assessments, lectures, and other elements.</p> 
<p>The creation of a basic packet for inheriting instructors, with insider 
tips about instructional methods, strategies, and resources, ensures the 
smoother transition of a course from one professor to another. Also, building a 
curriculum with an eye toward eventual inheritance can reduce the idiosyncratic 
elements in course materials.</p> 
<p>Beyond a simple instruction packet, full documentation of the entire course 
is also a necessary component of optimal curriculum design. Those who inherit a 
course will have a clearer range of choices and motion if they know the 
provenance of all the contents, if the digital materials are properly annotated 
and reasonably accessible, and if the original pedagogical plans are shared. 
The better an online course build is documented, the more easily it is 
preserved into the future. Also, the easier it is to update.</p> 
<p>The documentation may include legal documents, such as contracts, grants, 
formal letters of support, memorandums of agreement or understanding, media 
rights releases, copyright releases, and permissions. It might also include raw 
files from photo shoots, videography sessions, audio sessions,<em>machinima</em>
 captures, and lecture captures. Because raw digital data captures tend to be 
the &quot;least lossy,&quot; they must be protected for potential later use and 
possible editing into different file types and digital learning objects.</p> 
<h3>Adult Learner Retention</h3> 
<p>Research suggests that adult learners prefer practical learning that 
benefits their work lives. They need to have a clear sense about why they need 
to learn a particular thing. They need grounded learning that taps into lived 
experiences1 and are motivated by the usefulness of information and skills.2 
These factors underscore the need for measureable and clear learning objectives 
and also suggest attributes that should be part of any course that will have 
adults as students. Instructors and course designers can enhance the online 
learner experience and make it more real and engaging through applications of 
rich, multimodal, multimedia, and full-sensory (visual and sound) immersive 
learning.</p> 
<p>While learners base their decisions to continue in or drop out of a course 
on a range of reasons, only some of which instructors can influence, 
instructors do play an important role in helping learners, including adult 
students, acclimate to an online classroom. Instructors help connect learners 
to the campus, which can improve retention.3 They play a critical role in 
connecting learners to resources on campus. They set a professional and 
respectful tone by adhering to applicable laws and policies. They provide 
academic advisement. They have a major responsibility to create a rewarding 
learning experience that actualizes learner skills and knowledge. Instructors 
should identify at-risk learners (based on their communications and their 
submitted work) and provide tailored support for their learning.</p> 
<h3>Continuous Information Streams</h3> 
<p>Faculty in online courses benefit from information streams with learners 
and other stakeholders. One feedback loop involves learner participation in the 
online course. Instructors who maintain a course revision journal to capture 
the suggestions can apply these ideas to new designs, or they can integrate 
them immediately in the master course. Another strategy is to create formal and 
informal (back-end) channels for learner feedback.</p> 
<p>Formal channels usually involve learner surveys that are part of student 
satisfaction feedback. Instructors sometimes solicit informal feedback from 
learners at the end of the term. Students will often communicate directly with 
instructors and offer ideas via e-mails and telephone calls, all 
information-rich ways to capture suggestions.</p> 
<p>For shared, inherited courses that a group of instructors teach, the 
faculty may share their notes about lessons learned from their hands-on use of 
the curriculum and the experiences they had while teaching the course. 
Responsiveness to learner feedback both during and after the course may ease 
student frustrations, both by addressing their challenges and concerns and by 
respecting their voices.</p> 
<p>Back-end data mining in the learning/course management system can also be 
highly instructive. For example, the system may capture patterns of when 
students participate in class. The system might also note which files learners 
access and what class-related message boards and activities they like the best, 
data that can spark ideas for enhanced student participation. As one practical 
example, data that show that students are hard-pressed to submit work in 
particular times of a learning term can help the professor schedule heavier 
work at a different time.</p>  Endnotes

<h2>A Draft Checklist for Updating an Online Curriculum</h2> 
<p>&nbsp;This basic template for considering ways to update and revise an 
online course can be tailored to various course revision situations by adding 
questions.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Legal Guidelines and Relevant Policies</strong></p> 
<p>________ A. Do the course materials adhere to intellectual property (IP) 
laws and university/college guidelines? Do the teaching and learning practices 
in the course adhere to IP laws and organizational guidelines?</p> 
<p>________ B. Do the course materials and learning events adhere to 
accessibility requirements?</p> 
<p>________ C. Do the course materials and online teaching practices support 
learner privacy rights? Is there a formal course policy about student privacy 
rights?</p> 
<p>________ D. Is there a formal course policy about copyright? Is this policy 
made widely, transparently, and equitably available?</p> 
<p>________ E. Is there a formal course policy about academic honesty and an 
honor code? Is this policy made widely, transparently, and equitably available?
</p> 
<p>________ F. Are the course policies transparent? Are they aligned with 
federal laws and university policies? Are these legal guidelines and policies 
applied fairly and equitably?</p> 
<p><strong>2. Progress/Change in the Domain Field</strong></p> 
<p>________ A. Has there been a paradigm shift in the domain field? If so, has 
this been captured in the course curriculum and student learning?</p> 
<p>________ B. Have there been changes in the way that research is done? Are 
there new ways that fresh information is vetted and integrated into the field?
</p> 
<p>________ C. Are there innovative methods of applied work in the field? Do 
practitioners in the field have to use new skill sets?</p> 
<p>________ D. Are there modern thoughts on ethical practices in the field? 
Has the definition of professionalism evolved?</p> 
<p>________ E. Have there been changes in related fields that have impacts on 
the learning?</p> 
<p>________ F. Does the curriculum include all relevant information for 
students in the particular field? If not, what is missing?</p> 
<p>________ G. What are some strategies to create effective learning for 
novice and amateur learners? What are some strategies to create value-added 
learning for &quot;experts&quot; from the field taking the course?</p> 
<p><strong>3. The Course Curricular Strategies/Teaching and Learning 
Methodologies</strong></p> 
<p>________ A. Have visual aids been integrated with the learning?</p> 
<p>________ B. Have some multimedia-rich methods been applied to make the 
learning more engaging?</p> 
<p>________ C. Is the e-learning trajectory or path sensible? Is this path 
adaptable to changing circumstances, resources, and instructor and learner 
needs?</p> 
<p>________ D. Is the learning paced appropriately?</p> 
<p>________ E. Is there sufficient flexibility in the curriculum to 
accommodate a range of learners with differing and unique learning and 
professional needs?</p> 
<p>________ F. Is the curriculum tailored for the particular developmental 
levels of the learners? Are there ways to be more inclusive and supportive of 
learners?</p> 
<p>________ G. Is the curriculum sufficiently flexible to accommodate the 
various needs of online learners?</p> 
<p>________ H. Is the curriculum tailored to the particular learner group and 
its unique needs and characteristics? (if applicable)</p> 
<p>________ I. Is the learning tailored to a particular context &mdash; 
whether cultural, geographical, social, political, technological, or domain 
field?</p> 
<p>________ J. Are there sufficient opt-in help resources for students who 
engage in help-seeking? Are there sufficient resources for self-learners who 
pursue self-discovery learning?</p> 
<p><strong>4. Relevant Updated Technologies</strong></p> 
<p>________ A. Are the digital learning contents engaging? Are there engaging 
types of interactivity for the learners?</p> 
<p>________ B. Are the core learning contents accessible to all learners 
(regardless of visual acuity, hearing loss, mobility, and symbolic processing 
challenges)?</p> 
<p>________ C. Are the core digital contents portable between technological 
systems (learning/course management systems, digital repositories, websites, 
and socio-technical systems)? Do these deploy well on different systems and 
platforms?</p> 
<p>________ D. Do the digital labs, simulations, and 3-D immersive experiences 
(if included) work as scripted (on various platforms and operating systems, 
with various browsers, alongside various software technologies)?</p> 
<p>________ E. Are there value-added high-tech elements? Is the curriculum 
deployable on mobile devices (such as podcasts)? Do websites display well on 
mobile devices and other types of small-screens?</p> 
<h2>Modeling Proper Handling of Intellectual Property</h2> 
<p>An instructor teaching about weather and flight uses numerous images found 
on the World Wide Web and the Internet to illustrate his slideshows and talks. 
He has no real recollection of where the images came from. Lacking a way to add 
metadata when he made the slideshows and having no raw image repository, he had 
no way to establish either provenance or ownership of the images. When he 
looked for a particular image, he found several versions (with different names 
and labels) on various sites, but he could not establish the original owner or 
even a consistent name for each image. He wants to make sure all of his 
slideshows and desktop lecture captures used only images that he has fair 
rights to use. He knows of various government websites related to weather which 
have the resources he needs. He also knows of some images available on public 
image-sharing. As a serious professional, he wants to uphold the standards of 
the field.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Hurricane Tracking (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> This professor wants to model the proper uses 
of resources for his students by not contravening others' intellectual property 
rights. However, he has limited time to make changes to his extensive 
curriculum. What are some of his options?</p> 
<p><strong>What should he do?</strong></p> 
<p>A. He should ignore intellectual property concerns and keep using his 
digital contents on a password-protected course site. No one will know.</p> 
<p>B. He should switch out all the images and put in ones from respected 
sources that put images in the public domain.</p> 
<p>C. He should build new slideshows using higher intellectual property 
standards, and he should slowly phase out the elements that contravened 
copyright.</p> 
<p>D. He should turn himself in to the federal government.</p> 
<p>E. He should purchase all curricular contents from third-party content 
providers and get out of the business of creating his own teaching contents.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B. The professor actually went through and 
scrubbed his extant slideshows and lectures and swapped in images from the 
public domain. He pursued copyright releases for materials that he couldn't 
verify were fully available and kept documentation of the releases.</p> 
<p>A. Ignoring the law is no solution and no defense. C. is an option, but it 
still leaves him and the university with liabilities for the resources that 
possibly contravene copyright. D. Won't happen. E. This solution is too 
expensive.</p> 
<h2>Collaborations Across Institutions and Disciplines</h2> 
<p>A multi-institutional team of faculty from four colleges and one university 
in Kansas collaborated around developing a shared freshman level course for 
public health. They represented various disciplines, including veterinary 
medicine, biology, epidemiology, food science, biosecurity, law enforcement, 
and kinesiology. Given the breadth of the field and its changing nature (the 
H1N1 flu epidemic hit during the building of the course), the team wanted to 
bring in varied types of expertise to help learners. They invited experts in 
public health, gerontology, human-animal bonds and health, lab biosecurity 
measures, global food production, rabies, and national agricultural defense to 
speak on camera about their work and concerns. (The videos were shot by Kent 
Nelson, with assistance from Joseph Chapes. As the instructional designer on 
this project, I created and conducted all the interviews.)</p>

<p>Dr. Ingrid Garrison, &quot;Public Health and the Role of Veterinarians&quot;
</p> 
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The team also wanted to accommodate learners 
from around the world in their own locales, helping them understand some of the 
government structures put into place for human public health. How could they 
give learners an idea of some of the offices that support public health in 
their respective locales?</p> 
<p><strong>What should they do?</strong></p> 
<p>A. They should do video tours of facilities stateside and explain how the 
various public health offices or water treatment facilities or other offices 
work.</p> 
<p>B. They should encourage their learners to take web-based tours of various 
public health offices and venues.</p> 
<p>C. They should convey book knowledge and not worry about the real-world 
lived knowledge yet. These are only freshman and sophomore students.</p> 
<p>D. They should encourage students to visit their local public health venues 
&mdash; with the permission of their local authorities &mdash;to get a hands-on 
and lived sense of how public health is done.</p> 
<p>E. They should require students to travel to the U.S. to go on local tours 
of various public health facilities.</p> 
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> D. The team created flexible assignments that 
would allow learners to capitalize on their local public health resources in 
order to learn about the on-ground realities where they lived. The students 
were asked to share their findings with each other for an effective 
&quot;jigsaw&quot; experience.</p> 
<p>A. Video tours would be a stand-in for some types of site visits. B. 
Web-based tours may also substitute for some live visits. C. Book knowledge 
without lived knowledge is a limiting option. E. Requiring travel is too 
expensive for a fully online course.</p> 
<h2>Inclusiveness in a Virtual World</h2> 
<p>A faculty member worked with a team to build a virtual space in Second Life 
to showcase the adaptations that could meet the needs of people with 
disabilities. She had written a script with various characters that would 
interact in supportive and real-life ways. These characters were professionally 
designed in Second Life as avatars. She wanted to convey stories of their 
continuing interactions over episodic time. The technology could not provide 
full<em>machinima</em> captures, and the human-embodied avatar faces weren't 
realistically expressive. However, she could take screen shots of the avatars 
in the online spaces, and she could bring in amateur voice actors to play the 
roles. She wanted to have characters whom a range of people could relate to, in 
terms of race, age, ethnicity, culture, and other aspects.</p> 
<p>An immersive and interactive space demonstrates accessibility in action. 
Note the placement of the heat adjustments on the stove &mdash; up-front, they 
will not require reaching to the back of the stovetop &mdash; and the 
lower-height countertop to accommodate wheelchairs.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Kitchen at the LiveAbility House on Morrill Island</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> How could this professor address diversity in 
avatar representation in a sensitive and inclusive way?</p> 
<p><strong>What should she do?</strong></p> 
<p>A. She might design the avatars visually and in dialogue and behavior to be 
strategically ambiguous in terms of backgrounds.</p> 
<p>B. She could make each of the characters clearly represent a different 
demographic niche.</p> 
<p>C. She could ignore this issue and go with &quot;generic&quot; avatars. She 
could just assume a diverse audience would relate to characters derived from 
the mainstream.</p> 
<p>D. She could just use the pre-made avatars without any changes but using a 
variety of diverse voices and accents for the actors.</p> 
<p>E. She can abandon the series idea and just use different avatar characters 
each time. This way, she could have diverse characters at a small cost, with a 
kind of narrative and character-based continuity.</p> 
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. In this case, the principal investigator chose 
to go with strategic ambiguity in the characters.</p> 
<p>A variety of options were considered, and many others would have been 
possible, too. All projects balance competing interests and constraints. All 
options except C are reasonably appropriate.</p> 
<p>In further developing the concepts introduced in this virtual world, a 
series of videos were created showcasing problems faced by caregivers and 
healthy solutions to them.</p>

<h2>A Grain Science E-Book</h2> 
<p>A grain science instructor had used a paper-bound book with samples of 
actual grains in plastic bags stapled into the pages for many semesters. 
Putting the book together required painstaking human labor to create the bags, 
staple them in, and make sure the pages of the book were complete. The books 
were stored in a cabinet and doled out each semester to a small group of 
students. To save on the labor and other costs, the faculty member commissioned 
an electronic book. She had a digital camera mounted on a microscope and 
instructed a graduate student to capture the images of the various grains at 
several levels of magnification, with digital images of a measure to help 
learners get a sense of the actual size. Then she had an instructional designer 
(me) put together the electronic book, which has long replaced the paper one.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Pages from the Grain Science E-Book</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The instructor still wants learners to get a 
sense of the grains in a three-dimensional sense. This has not yet been 
achieved. What are some options she could consider?</p> 
<p><strong>What should she do?</strong></p> 
<p>A. She should pursue an on-campus grant source for teaching excellence. 
Then she should have her graduate student do 3D captures of the grains and have 
them delivered as part of a digital repository that students may access and use 
to manipulate the images.</p> 
<p>B. She should have a separate physical set of grains that can be mailed to 
students. These are 3D and can be handled in a tactile way.</p> 
<p>C. She should use words and other descriptors to give a sense of the 
physical aspects of these grains. Those combined with 2D images should be 
sufficient. The three dimensions are not necessary.</p> 
<p>D. She should check the open-source world for full 3D captures of the 
various grains that she's using in her courses.</p> 
<p>E. She should partner with another institution of higher learning and 
collaborate on a digital grain &quot;laboratory&quot; that offers 
high-resolution images in 2D and 3D, enabling learner immersion in the grain 
work. Or, she could partner with another department on campus.</p> 
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. This is the simplest solution, but if E. is 
possible, it should be pursued. B. has already been done and was found to be 
onerous. C. lacks some of the nuances of 3D perception. D. is a little 
idealistic. Open-source resources are many, but there are many gaps in terms of 
online learning.</p> <br>
