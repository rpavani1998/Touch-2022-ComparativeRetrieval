<p>COOPERATIVE EDUCATION/INTERNSHIPS </p> 
<p>The purpose of the Cooperative Education/Internship program is to provide 
practical experiences for students that complement their academic studies and 
introduce them to the world of work with its corresponding professional 
activities. These work-based learning experiences promote the application of 
theoretical knowledge and research skills acquired in the classroom to a 
productive and supervised experiential work site outside the formal classroom 
environment. Cooperative education and internships assist students in the 
career development process by enabling them to examine their abilities, values, 
and interests while applying them to an actual career experience.</p> 
<p>One distinction between cooperative education and an internship is that 
co-op assignments are, more often than not, paid work experiences. Internships 
usually are non-paid, volunteer assignments and are often combined with 
additional readings and research.</p> 
<p>The granting of academic credit for an approved work experience is 
determined by the student's faculty sponsor and the university coordinator 
after an examination of the following criteria: nature of the work to be 
performed, the proposed learning objectives, the number of weeks involved, and 
the anticipated hours per week. Students must apply to the coordinator for 
cooperative education/internship before registering for the class. It is 
strongly recommended that planning and application for all cooperative 
education and internship experiences begin during the semester prior to 
participation.</p> 
<p>Many fields of study require as a condition of graduation the completion of 
one or more training programs or courses in an outside clinical or professional 
setting, such as a hospital, clinic, professional office, or public classroom. 
These outside institutions, offices, and schools that provide the environmental 
opportunities to students sometimes impose additional requirements as 
conditions of participation in their programs. Such requirements might include 
evidence of a recent medical examination; evidence of health, auto or other 
insurance; a written agreement to personally accept and abide by the rules and 
regulations of that institution; the execution of an indemnity agreement or 
release relative to personal liability or liability to others; and similar 
requirements pertinent to the particular study program. The University assumes 
assent and compliance to such requirements, rules, and regulations by each 
student upon his or her enrollment in those courses involving outside study.</p>

such thing as a generic or standard reading of a literary work; all readings 
take place in and depend on a critical framework, whether that be explicit or 
implicit. From this starting point, the course is constructed around several 
critical approaches. One of these is a formalist approach in which students 
interpret the literary text on the basis of its formal features and stylistic 
conventions. Students will then explore other opposing and overlapping critical

<p>ENG 231 Techniques of Poetry </p> 
<p>This course provides an opportunity to study poetry through the dual 
processes of observation and imitation, to understand how specific writing 
techniques produce effective poetry. Students are encouraged to study and 
duplicate-within the context of their own individual writing styles-the 
techniques employed by successful poets. Aspects of both a literature course 
and writing course are thus combined in pursuit of a pragmatic working 
knowledge of the techniques of poetry. Students will critically examine and 
then experiment for themselves with various forms of poetry, writing and 
revising both critical essays and poetry, reading and sharing their work in 
small writing workshop groups. Prerequisite: ENG 101 with grade of B- or 
better, or permission of instructor. 3 Cr</p> 
<p>ENG 232 Techniques of Fiction </p> 
<p>A survey course in contemporary fiction. This course focuses on literary 
works primarily as products of the writing process. Rather than interpreting 
stories or analyzing them with regard to a cultural milieu, the class will 
treat them as case studies for technique. The artists whose works have been 
selected for this course are generally innovators-that is, writers exploring 
the boundaries of traditional narrative, in both form and style. While the 
course is intended principally for students who are themselves interested in 
writing fiction, any student of literature may find such an approach useful and 
interesting. Prerequisite: ENG 101 with grade of B- or better, or permission of 
instructor. 3 Cr</p> 
<p>ENG 233 Techniques of Creative Non-Fiction </p> 
<p>Creative nonfiction is a genre defined by what it is not. It differs from 
other forms of nonfiction by possessing both an apparent subject and a deeper 
meaning, by its freedom from the usual journalistic requirements of timeliness 
and urgency, by taking advantage of such narrative devices as character, plot 
and dialogue, by its sense of reflection and finished thought, and by its 
serious attention to the craft of writing and aesthetic sensibility that goes 
well beyond the journalistic &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; style. This course 
provides the opportunity to study creative nonfiction through the dual 
processes of observation and imitation, to understand how specific writing 
techniques produce effective literature. Students are encouraged to study and 
duplicate-within the context of their own individual writing styles-the 
techniques employed successfully by published writers of creative nonfiction.

<p>ENG 345 The Book, Culture, and Knowledge </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The history of the book, a relatively recent and growing focus of 
scholarship, derives from the recognition of texts -- literary, scholarly, 
popular, practical, and more -- do not float free. Even the Internet has not 
changed the fact that most texts are embodied in books, material forms produced 
not just by authors, but by larger commercial, governmental, religious 
enterprises. These enterprises, in turn, are shaped by their social, economic, 
cultural, and technological environment. This course seeks to expand student 
understanding of texts by foregrounding the broader cultural context through 
and in which they take form. The course will cover the history of technologies 
of writing, paper, manuscript production, and printing, the history of 
literacy, education and reading, as well as the history of the book. It will be 
attentive to the impact of different kinds of books -- scripture, subversive 
writings, and consumables -- on societies and across cultures. It will consider 
the ways in which institutions have sought to control books. While the course 
is centered on the western tradition, it will include sections on non-western 
traditions and on the post-modern era. Prerequisite: HTY 115 or HTY 116, and

about the past. Students tend to share the general public's notion that history 
presents a series of established facts, which may be entertaining or 
enlightening. This course seeks to correct that view by exploring the diverse 
repertoire of assumptions, goals, approaches, and interpretations among 
historians past and present. While introducing the history of history and 
theoretical issues surrounding its practice, the course is also a practical 
introduction to reading, writing, and research within the discipline.

scholarship, derives from the recognition of texts -- literary, scholarly, 
popular, practical, and more -- do not float free. Even the Internet has not 
changed the fact that most texts are embodied in books, material forms produced 
not just by authors, but by larger commercial, governmental, religious 
enterprises. These enterprises, in turn, are shaped by their social, economic, 
cultural, and technological environment. This course seeks to expand student 
understanding of texts by foregrounding the broader cultural context through 
and in which they take form. The course will cover the history of technologies 
of writing, paper, manuscript production, and printing, the history of 
literacy, education and reading, as well as the history of the book. It will be 
attentive to the impact of different kinds of books -- scripture, subversive
