<p>Introductory Quotations:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We are particularly interested in new outcomes that may be possible through 
ALN. Asynchronous computer networks have the potential to<strong>improve 
contact with faculty</strong>, perhaps making self-paced learning a realizable 
goal for some off- and on-campus students. For example, a motivated student 
could progress more rapidly toward a degree. Students who are motivated but 
find they cannot keep up the pace, may be able to slow down and take longer to 
complete a degree, and not just drop out in frustration. So we are interested 
in what impact ALN will have on outcomes such as time-to-degree and student 
retention. There are many opportunities where ALN may contribute to another 
outcome: lowering the cost of education, e.g., by naturally introducing new 
values for old measures such as student-faculty ratios. A different kind of 
outcome for learners who are juggling work and family responsibilities, would 
be to be able to earn a degree or certification at home. This latter is a 
special focus for us.</p>

<p>It may well be that some of our universities will decide that their 
comparative advantage lies in operating highly personal, mediated, residential 
teaching experiences.&nbsp; If so, no doubt a whole new series of postsecondary 
learning opportunities will emerge from the commercial sector of our 
economy.&nbsp; These new entrants would likely be characterized by the use of 
information technology to help deliver learning experiences were learners want 
them, when they want them, and at a cost they find acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> 
<p>Before reading this, you should read about asynchronous learning at  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning </p> 
<p>Some futurists predict that our physical campuses will decay and crumble as 
higher education alternatives explode on the web. I do not agree! Most of our 
campuses will thrive and prosper<em>if we learn how to bridge our curriculum 
gaps with the web and still maintain some of the best of what we traditionally 
accomplish in classes and other face-to-face encounters with our student</em>s. 
Also, some of our traditional courses perhaps should no longer meet in 
regularly scheduled class periods even if these courses are only made available 
to resident students. There may, however, be a shift in emphasis from the 
awarding of traditional degrees to the awarding of education and training 
certifications across disciplines. In<em>On the Horizon</em>, May/June 1997, 
James Morrison contends that by the Year 1004 leading-edge educational 
institutions will use competency-based certification multimedia learning 
modules and virual learning environments.&nbsp; The article cited below is one 
of many articles and speeches from leading educators who consider diplomas and 
degrees obsolete:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A seamless, cradle -to-grave educational system is within our reach, if we 
muster the courage and will to create it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Diplomas and Degrees 
are Obsolete,&quot; D.N. Langenberg, The Chancellor of the University System of 
Maryland,<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, September 12, 1997, Page A64.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This does not necessarily mean that institutions granting diplomas and 
degrees will crumble and fall as households become linked to the web around the 
world. On-campus courses will be available for certifications across a wide 
variety of educational accomplishments.</p> 
<p>As network education opportunities increase, traditional universities will 
have to add more course choices to curricula in order to keep pace with their 
old and newer competitors. It is tempting to contemplate adding courses by 
contracting for networked courses developed by and possibly distributed from 
other universities. However, if high quality pedagogy is to be maintained, 
there are some significant costs that are being discovered in early experiences 
with<strong> asynchronous networked learning (ALN</strong>). ALN appears to be 
more like the old days where great teachers spent a lot of time with students 
outside of class. ALN implicitly assumes computer networking and/or CD-ROM
<strong>hypertext </strong>and <strong>hypermedia</strong>.&nbsp; Producing 
good ALN materials entails significant training of faculty and reconsideration 
of reward structures for learning materials development of college faculty.</p> 
<p>Results show that network (distributed education) courses will be labor 
intensive in terms of dealing with student messaging and evaluation of student 
work. Faculty or teaching assistants must be online to evaluate student written 
and oral communications. Studies have shown that messaging explodes 
exponentially if asynchronous network courses are to maximize learning 
effectiveness. Whether or not the &quot;labor&quot; (faculty, graduate 
students, or hired guns) will be provided by the &quot;vendor&quot; (say MIT) 
or the &quot;customer&quot; (say Trinity University) is a matter of conjecture. 
Most likely, the cost of an imported course will be less than cranking up a 
traditional or ALN course on campus. However, the cost of &quot;faculty&quot; 
may not be significantly reduced for reasons discussed in this paper.</p> 
<p>Do you recall the praise that I lavished on the ethics website of a 
Carnegie-Mellon University Philosophy Professor named Robert Cavalier in my 
March 22, 000 edition of<i>New Bookmarks</i>?&nbsp; See 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/book00q1.htm#032200&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Robert Cavalier now has an article entitled &quot;Cases, Narratives, and 
Interactive Multimedia,&quot; in<i>Syllabus</i>, May 2000. pp. 20-22.&nbsp; The 
online version of the Syllabus article is not yet posted, but will eventually 
be available athttp://www.syllabus.com/&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The purpose of our evaluation of <i>A Right to Die?&nbsp; The Case of Dax 
Cowart</i> was to see if learning outcomes for case studies could be enhanced 
with the use of interactive multimedia.&nbsp; My Introduction to Ethics class 
was divided into three groups:&nbsp; Text, Film, and CD-ROM.&nbsp; Equal 
distribution was achieved by using student scores on previous exams plus their 
Verbal SAT scores.</p> 
<p>Two graders were trained and achieved more than 90 percent in grader 
variabilility.&nbsp; The results of the students' performance were put through 
statistical analysis and the null hypothesis was rejected for the CD/Film and 
CD/Text groups.&nbsp; <b>Significant statistical difference was demonstrated in 
favor of interactive multimedia.</b></p> </blockquote>

<p>&quot;<b>Critical Thinking:&nbsp; Why It's So Hard to Teach</b>,&quot; by

<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Critical thinking is not a set of skills that can be 
deployed at any time, in any context. It is a type of thought that even 
3-year-olds can engage in&mdash;and even trained scientists can fail in.&rdquo;
</strong></em></p> 
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Knowing that one should think critically is not the same 
as being able to do so. That requires domain knowledge and practice.&rdquo;
</strong></em></p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em><strong>So,&nbsp; Why Is Thinking Critically So Hard?</strong></em><br>

 Educators have long noted that school attendance and even academic success are 
no guarantee that a student will graduate an effective thinker in all 
situations. There is an odd tendency for rigorous thinking to cling to 
particular examples or types of problems. Thus, a student may have learned to 
estimate the answer to a math problem before beginning calculations as a way of 
checking the accuracy of his answer, but in the chemistry lab, the same student 
calculates the components of a compound without noticing that his estimates sum 
to more than 100 percent. And a student who has learned to thoughtfully discuss 
the causes of the American Revolution from both the British and American 
perspectives doesn&rsquo;t even think to question how the Germans viewed World 
War II. Why are students able to think critically in one situation, but not in 
another? The brief answer is: Thought processes are intertwined with what is 
being thought about. Let&rsquo;s explore this in depth by looking at a 
particular kind of critical thinking that has been studied extensively: problem 
solving.</p> 
<p>Imagine a seventh-grade math class immersed in word problems. How is it 
that students will be able to answer one problem, but not the next, even though 
mathematically both word problems are the same, that is, they rely on the same 
mathematical knowledge? Typically, the students are focusing on the scenario 
that the word problem describes (its surface structure) instead of on the 
mathematics required to solve it (its deep structure). So even though students 
have been taught how to solve a particular type of word problem, when the 
teacher or textbook changes the scenario, students still struggle to apply the 
solution because they don&rsquo;t recognize that the problems are 
mathematically the same.</p> 
<p><strong>Thinking Tends to Focus on a Problem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Surface 
Structure&rdquo;</strong><br>
 To understand why the surface structure of a 
problem is so distracting and, as a result, why it&rsquo;s so hard to apply 
familiar solutions to problems that appear new, let&rsquo;s first consider how 
you understand what&rsquo;s being asked when you are given a problem. Anything 
you hear or read is automatically interpreted in light of what you already know 
about similar subjects. For example, suppose you read these two sentences: 
&ldquo;After years of pressure from the film and television industry, the 
President has filed a formal complaint with China over what U.S. firms say is 
copyright infringement. These firms assert that the Chinese government sets 
stringent trade restrictions for U.S. entertainment products, even as it turns 
a blind eye to Chinese companies that copy American movies and television shows 
and sell them on the black market.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>With Deep Knowledge, Thinking Can Penetrate Beyond Surface Structure
</strong><br>
 If knowledge of how to solve a problem never transferred to 
problems with new surface structures, schooling would be inefficient or even 
futile&mdash;but of course, such transfer does occur. When and why is complex,5 
but two factors are especially relevant for educators: familiarity with a 
problem&rsquo;s deep structure and the knowledge that one should look for a 
deep structure. I&rsquo;ll address each in turn. When one is very familiar with 
a problem&rsquo;s deep-structure, knowledge about how to solve it transfers 
well. That familiarity can come from long-term, repeated experience with one 
problem, or with various manifestations of one type of problem (i.e., many 
problems that have different surface structures, but the same deep structure). 
After repeated exposure to either or both, the subject simply perceives the 
deep structure as part of the problem description.</p> </blockquote>

<p> &quot;The Medium is Not the Message,&quot;&nbsp; by Jonathan Kaplan,<i> 
Inside Higher Ed</i>, August 11, 2009 --- <br>
 
http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2009/08/11/kaplan&nbsp; </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A few weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that 
looked at 12 years' worth of education studies, and found that online learning 
has clear advantages over face-to-face instruction.<br>
<br>
 The study, 
&quot;An Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A 
Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies,&quot; stated that 
&ldquo;students who took all or part of their class online performed better, on 
average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face 
instruction.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Except for one article, on this Web site, you 
probably didn&rsquo;t hear about it -- and neither did anyone else.<br>
<br>
 
But imagine for a moment that the report came to the opposite conclusion. 
I&rsquo;m sure that if the U.S. Department of Education had published a report 
showing that students in online learning environments performed<i>worse</i>, 
there would have been a major outcry in higher education with calls to shut 
down distance-learning programs and close virtual campuses.<br>
<br>
 I believe 
the reason that the recent study elicited so little commentary is due to the 
fact that it flies in the face of the biases held by some across the higher 
education landscape. Yet this study confirms what those of us working in 
distance education have witnessed for years: Good teaching helps students 
achieve, and good teaching comes in many forms.<br>
<br>
 We know that online 
learning requires devout attention on the part of both the professor and the 
student -- and a collaboration between the two -- in a different way from that 
of a face-to-face classroom. These critical aspects of online education are 
worth particular mention:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Greater student engagement</b>: In an online classroom, there is no 
back row and nowhere for students to hide. Every student participates in class.
</li> 
<li><b>Increased faculty attention</b>: In most online classes, the 
faculty&rsquo;s role is focused on mentoring students and fostering discussion. 
Interestingly, many faculty members choose to teach online because they want<i>
more</i> student interaction. </li> 
<li><b>Constant access</b>: The Internet is open 24/7, so students can share 
ideas and &ldquo;sit in class&rdquo; whenever they have time or when an idea 
strikes -- whether it be the dead of night or during lunch. Online learning 
occurs on the student&rsquo;s time, making it more accessible, convenient, and 
attainable.</li> </ul> 
<p>At Walden University, where I am president, we have been holding ourselves 
accountable for years, as have many other online universities, regarding 
assessment. All universities must ensure that students are meeting program 
outcomes and learning what they need for their jobs. To that end, universities 
should be better able to demonstrate -- quantitatively and qualitatively -- the 
employability and success of their students and graduates.</p> 
<p>Recently, we examined the successes of Walden graduates who are teachers in 
the Tacoma, Wash., public school system, and found that students in Walden 
teachers&rsquo; classes tested with higher literacy rates than did students 
taught by teachers who earned their master&rsquo;s from other universities. 
There could be many reasons for this, but, especially in light of the U.S. 
Department of Education study, it seems that online learning has contributed 
meaningfully to their becoming better teachers.</p> 
<p>In higher education, there is still too much debate about how we are 
delivering content: Is it online education, face-to-face teaching, or hybrid 
instruction? It&rsquo;s time for us to stop categorizing higher education by 
the medium of delivery and start focusing on its impact and outcomes.<br>
<br>
 
Recently, President Obama remarked, &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a possibility 
that online education can provide, especially for people who are already in the 
workforce and want to retrain, the chance to upgrade their skills without 
having to quit their job.&rdquo; As the U.S. Department of Education study 
concluded, online education can do that and much more.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> But Kaplan above ignores some of the dark side aspects of distance 
education and education technology in general --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/theworry.htm <br>
 The biggest hurdle, in 
my opinion, is that if distance education is done correctly with intensive 
online communications, instructors soon become burned out. In an effort to 
avoid burn out, much of the learning effectiveness is lost. Hence the distance 
education paradox.</p> 
<p> <b>Kaplan also ignores some of the strong empirical support for online 
learning, especially the enlightening SCALE experiments at the University of 
Illinois --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois</b></p> 
<p> August 28, 2009 reply from Bob Jensen</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>One of the most successful distance education programs in the world, in my 
viewpoint, is the masters degree program headquartered in Vancouver called the 
Chartered Accountancy School of Business ---http://www.casb.com/ </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you live in Western Canada, you obtain your CA designation by enrolling 
in the CA School of Business. The CASB program is flexible, combining the 
successful completion of a series of online modules with a three-year term of 
professional experience. Find out more about our program.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Some years back I was one of the outside reviewers brought in to examine 
CASB. I was impressed by the quality of this degree program and the tough 
standards of the program.</p> 
<p>CASB is one of the few competency-based graduate programs in the world. By 
competency-based I mean that instructors have inputs in designing examinations 
for all students in the program, but at the same time, have no input in grading 
individual students. There can be no instructor-option subjective factors when 
assigning grades, which means no changes in grade for effort and interpersonal 
relationships.</p> 
<p>The success of the CASB program, however, is a bit biased as is the success 
of the ADEPT Masters of Engineering distance education program in Electrical 
Engineering at Stanford University. Firstly, students admitted to these 
programs were top undergraduate students majoring in very difficult 
concentrations. Secondly, in the case of the CASB, the students are all 
employed full time in Chartered Accountancy firms and are under heavy pressure 
to do well at all stages of the three year program.</p> 
<p>Students do meet face-to-face on some weekends (monthly?) for some live 
classes --- case studies and examinations..</p> 
<p>One other competency-based distance education program that has been booming 
in recent years is Western Governors University in the U.S. ---
http://www.wgu.edu/ </p> 
<p>Most other distance education programs allow instructors more latitude in 
assigning grades.</p> 
<p>Bob Jensen</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The one thing to keep in mind is that there is no one pedagogy that is best 
in all circumstances. And our best students are probably going to get A grades 
under any pedagogy --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm#AssessmentIssues&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The failing of distance education lies more in the instructors than the 
students. If done well, distance education tends to burn out instructors and 
takes an extraordinary amount of time relative to teaching onsite. If done 
poorly, the culprit is most likely the tendency to assign part-time or 
otherwise non-tenured instructors to the distance education courses. At the 
other extreme we have the dregs of the tenured faculty assigned to the distance 
education division.</p> 
<p>The really bright spots in distance education are the times when the 
practicing professionals who are really good at their craft take on a distance 
education course either as a public service or as an experiment to see how they 
like teaching. The University of Phoenix has been good at attracting some top

<p> Bob:</p> 
<p>I've always believed that the role of the teacher is one of 
FACILITATOR.&nbsp; My role in the classroom is making it EASIER for information 
to move from one place to another - from point A to point B.&nbsp; This could 
be from textbook to student, it could be from the outside world to the student, 
from another student to the student, from the student him or herself to that 
same student AND from teacher to student (me to them).&nbsp; In defining the 
word 'teaching', I think many people overemphasize the last transition that I 
mentioned, thinking that the primary movement of information is from them(the 
teacher) to the students.&nbsp; In fact, it constitutes a minority of total 
facilitated information flow in a college classroom.&nbsp; I think this 
misunderstanding leads many to underestimate the value of other sources in the 
education process other than themselves.&nbsp; Online content is just one of 
many alternative sources.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, online formats do allow certain professors to hide behind 
the electronic cloak and politely excuse themselves from the equation, which 
greatly hurts the student.&nbsp; Also, online formats can be fertile ground for 
professors who lack not only the desire to 'teach' but the ability and thus 
become mere administrators versus teachers.</p>

misconstrue causality</b>:</p> 
<p><i>  Like elaborately plumed birds &hellip; we preen and strut and display 
our t-values.&rdquo; That was Edward Leamer&rsquo;s uncharitable description of 
his profession in 1983.</i></p> 
<p>  &ldquo;Cause and Effect:&nbsp; Instrumental variable help to isolate 
causal relationships, but they can be taken too far,&rdquo;<i>The Economist</i>

<p>  It is often the case that distance education courses are taught by 
non-tenured instructors, and non-tenured instructors may be easier with respect 
to grading than tenured faculty because they are even more in need of strong 
teaching evaluations --- so as to not lose their jobs. The problem may have 
nothing whatsoever to do with online versus onsite education ---ergo 
misconstrued causality.</p> 
<p>  I think it&rsquo;s very rewarding to look at grading in formal studies 
using the same full-time faculty teaching sections of online versus onsite 
students. By formal study, I mean using the same instructors, the same 
materials, and essentially the same examinations. The major five-year, 
multimillion dollar study that first caught my eye was the SCALE experiments on 
the campus of the University of Illinois where 30 courses from various 
disciplines were examined over a five year experiment.</p> 
<p>  Yes the SCALE experiments showed that some students got higher grades 
online, notably B students who became A students and C students who became A 
students. The online pedagogy tended to have no effect on D and F students ---  
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois </p> 
<p>  Listen to Dan Stone&rsquo;s audio about the SCALE Experiments ---  
http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/000cpe/00start.htm </p> 
<p>  But keep in mind that in the SCALE experiments, the same instructor of a 
course was grading both the online and onsite sections of the same course. The 
reason was not likely to be that online sections were easier. The SCALE 
experiments collected a lot of data pointing to more intense communications 
with instructors and more efficient use of student&rsquo;s time that is often 
wasted in going to classes.</p> 
<p>  The students in the experiment were full time on campus students, such 
that the confounding problems of having adult part-time students was not a 
factor in the SCALE experiments of online, asynchronous learning.</p> 
<p>  &nbsp;</p> 
<p>  A Statement About Why the SCALE Experiments Were Funded<br>
 ALN = 
Asynchronous Learning<br>
<i>We are particularly interested in new outcomes 
that may be possible through ALN. Asynchronous computer networks have the 
potential to</i> <strong> improve contact with faculty</strong><i>, perhaps 
making self-paced learning a realizable goal for some off- and on-campus 
students. For example, a motivated student could progress more rapidly toward a 
degree. Students who are motivated but find they cannot keep up the pace, may 
be able to slow down and take longer to complete a degree, and not just drop 
out in frustration. So we are interested in what impact ALN will have on 
outcomes such as time-to-degree and student retention. There are many 
opportunities where ALN may contribute to another outcome: lowering the cost of 
education, e.g., by naturally introducing new values for old measures such as 
student-faculty ratios. A different kind of outcome for learners who are 
juggling work and family responsibilities, would be to be able to earn a degree 
or certification at home. This latter is a special focus for us.</i></p>

<p><b>REPORT ON ONLINE EDUCATION STUDY</b></p> 
<p>&quot;More than one-third of public university faculty have taught an 
online course while more than one-half have recommended an online course to 
students . . . . In addition, nearly 64 percent of faculty said it takes 
'somewhat more' or 'a lot more' effort to teach online compared to a 
face-to-face course. However, a large majority of faculty cited student needs 
as a primary motivator for teaching online, most commonly citing 'meet student 
needs for flexible access' or the 'best way to reach particular students' as 
the reason they choose to teach online courses.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;In 2006, the National Humanities Alliance (NHA) created a task force 
to assist in &quot;exploring issues related to scholarly journal publishing in 
[U.S.] humanities and social science (HSS) associations.&quot; Each of the 
eight collaborating associations selected a representative journal for detailed 
review. Among the study's findings was that &quot;a shift to an entirely new 
funding model in the pure form of Open Access (author/producer pays) in which 
the costs of publishing research articles in journals are paid for by authors

sustainable option for any of this group of journals based on the costs

<p>&quot;While current computing practice abounds with innovations like online 
auctions, blogs, wikis, twitter, social networks and online social games, few 
if any genuinely new theories have taken root in the corresponding 'top' 
academic journals. Those creating computing progress increasingly see these 
journals as unreadable, outdated and irrelevant. Yet as technology practice 
creates, technology theory is if anything becoming even more conforming and 
less relevant. We attribute this to the erroneous assumption that research 
rigor is excellence, a myth contradicted by the scientific method itself. 
Excess rigor supports the demands of appointment, grant and promotion 
committees, but is drying up the wells of academic inspiration.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><b>Why Top Universities Will Be ALN Course &quot;Vendors&quot;</b>
</strong></p> 
<p>Before reading this section, you may want to take a brief look at <strong>
The Web of Asynchronous Learning Networks</strong>.</p> 
<p>The following quotation from a high-level Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology EVAT committee report says it all in terms of why top universities 
will offer networked courses and programs.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Risks and Opportunities.</b> MIT could easily misjudge the impact of 
advanced technologies if we are not prepared. If distance education becomes 
well understood by other universities but not us, we are at risk of losing our 
reputation as leaders in education. We might find ourselves competing on price 
with other universities in courses like our freshman subjects. Or, on the other 
hand, we might overlook the opportunity to capitalize on MIT's name recognition 
to market education programs for the large number of students who are qualified 
for MIT but whom we cannot admit for lack of space.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As quoted from the Long Range Recommendations at 
http://www-evat.mit.edu/report/long.html</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In the Executive Summary of that same EVAT Committee Report it is stated 
that</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Of all the possible futures for MIT, the most disturbing is the one in 
which others find out how to offer distance education using advanced 
technologies, and MIT either does not learn how, or elects not to offer it. The 
economic strength of MIT could be seriously undercut by competition as a result.
</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Competitors will not just come from traditional colleges and 
universities.&nbsp; Junk bond king Michael Milken is putting together a virtual 
education training empire known as Knowledge Universe.&nbsp; To date, Knowledge 
Universe has invested multimillions of dollars to acquire and build an online 
educational empire that will challenge schools ranging from local elementary 
schools to Ivy League universities. &nbsp; The goal, according to Milken, is to 
use computers and networking technologies to make education and training 
available virtually anywhere in the world.&nbsp; It is too soon to predict when 
and how fast accredited programs will be online, but traditional colleges and 
universities are not waiting for the business world to take over market shares.
</p> 
<p>A message about an online course from the Harvard Law School is provided in 
Appendix 2.</p> 
<p>Another reason universities may one day be vendors of networked courses is 
that grants have been provided to a significant number of universities to 
develop asynchronous networked courses.<b>Once these courses are networked on a 
given campus, it becomes profitable to distribute ALN courses to other 
universities.</b> The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's Program in Learning Outside 
the Classroom has issued a number of Asynchronous Learning Network (ALN ) 
grants including a $500,000 grant to the new virtual Western Governors 
University and similar (larger and smaller) grants to Brown University, Cornell 
University, Virginia Tech, University of Minnesota, Penn State, NYU, UC 
Berkeley, Stanford University, and many others listed at 
http://www.sloan.org/Education/ALN.new.html#grants. Also see 
http://w3.scale.uiuc.edu/scale/&nbsp; for a description of the program.</p> 
<p>Yet another reason for distributing networked ALN courses is they appear to 
be more effective than traditional pedagogy if they are developed and 
administered properly. Readers interested in asynchronous learning experiments 
may want to track the ALN experiments at the University of Illinois (under a 
$2.1 million Sloan ALN grant for 25 classes in varying disciplines as described 
athttp://ftp.cs.uiuc.edu/CS_INFO_SERVER/ALUMNI_INFO/newsletter/v1n6/sloan.html).

<p> &quot;The Medium is Not the Message,&quot;&nbsp; by Jonathan Kaplan,<i> 
Inside Higher Ed</i>, August 11, 2009 --- <br>
 
http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2009/08/11/kaplan&nbsp; </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A few weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that 
looked at 12 years' worth of education studies, and found that online learning 
has clear advantages over face-to-face instruction.<br>
<br>
 The study, 
&quot;An Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A 
Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies,&quot; stated that 
&ldquo;students who took all or part of their class online performed better, on 
average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face 
instruction.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Except for one article, on this Web site, you 
probably didn&rsquo;t hear about it -- and neither did anyone else.<br>
<br>
 
But imagine for a moment that the report came to the opposite conclusion. 
I&rsquo;m sure that if the U.S. Department of Education had published a report 
showing that students in online learning environments performed<i>worse</i>, 
there would have been a major outcry in higher education with calls to shut 
down distance-learning programs and close virtual campuses.<br>
<br>
 I believe 
the reason that the recent study elicited so little commentary is due to the 
fact that it flies in the face of the biases held by some across the higher 
education landscape. Yet this study confirms what those of us working in 
distance education have witnessed for years: Good teaching helps students 
achieve, and good teaching comes in many forms.<br>
<br>
 We know that online 
learning requires devout attention on the part of both the professor and the 
student -- and a collaboration between the two -- in a different way from that 
of a face-to-face classroom. These critical aspects of online education are 
worth particular mention:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Greater student engagement</b>: In an online classroom, there is no 
back row and nowhere for students to hide. Every student participates in class.
</li> 
<li><b>Increased faculty attention</b>: In most online classes, the 
faculty&rsquo;s role is focused on mentoring students and fostering discussion. 
Interestingly, many faculty members choose to teach online because they want<i>
more</i> student interaction. </li> 
<li><b>Constant access</b>: The Internet is open 24/7, so students can share 
ideas and &ldquo;sit in class&rdquo; whenever they have time or when an idea 
strikes -- whether it be the dead of night or during lunch. Online learning 
occurs on the student&rsquo;s time, making it more accessible, convenient, and 
attainable.</li> </ul> 
<p>At Walden University, where I am president, we have been holding ourselves 
accountable for years, as have many other online universities, regarding 
assessment. All universities must ensure that students are meeting program 
outcomes and learning what they need for their jobs. To that end, universities 
should be better able to demonstrate -- quantitatively and qualitatively -- the 
employability and success of their students and graduates.</p> 
<p>Recently, we examined the successes of Walden graduates who are teachers in 
the Tacoma, Wash., public school system, and found that students in Walden 
teachers&rsquo; classes tested with higher literacy rates than did students 
taught by teachers who earned their master&rsquo;s from other universities. 
There could be many reasons for this, but, especially in light of the U.S. 
Department of Education study, it seems that online learning has contributed 
meaningfully to their becoming better teachers.</p> 
<p>In higher education, there is still too much debate about how we are 
delivering content: Is it online education, face-to-face teaching, or hybrid 
instruction? It&rsquo;s time for us to stop categorizing higher education by 
the medium of delivery and start focusing on its impact and outcomes.<br>
<br>
 
Recently, President Obama remarked, &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a possibility 
that online education can provide, especially for people who are already in the 
workforce and want to retrain, the chance to upgrade their skills without 
having to quit their job.&rdquo; As the U.S. Department of Education study 
concluded, online education can do that and much more.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> But Kaplan above ignores some of the dark side aspects of distance 
education and education technology in general --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/theworry.htm <br>
 The biggest hurdle, in 
my opinion, is that if distance education is done correctly with intensive 
online communications, instructors soon become burned out. In an effort to 
avoid burn out, much of the learning effectiveness is lost. Hence the distance 
education paradox.</p> 
<p> Kaplan also ignores some of the strong empirical support for online 
learning, especially the enlightening SCALE experiments at the University of 
Illinois --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So much learning now takes place online, including faculty office hours, 
study groups, and lectures.<br>

<p>&quot;<b>The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age</b>,&quot; 
by&nbsp; Jane Park,<i>Creative Commons</i>, June 26th, 2009 ---

<blockquote> 
<p>HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory) 
announced a new report called,&ldquo;The Future of Learning Institutions in a 
Digital Age,&rdquo;  now available at MIT Press. The report is in response to 
our changing times, and addresses what traditional educational institutions 
must know to keep up. From the  announcement,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Cathy N. Davidson and David Theo Goldberg in an abridged version of 
their book-in-progress, The Future of Thinking: Learning Institutions in a 
Digital Age, argue that traditional institutions must adapt or risk a growing 
mismatch between how they teach and how this new generation learns. Forms and 
models of learning have evolved quickly and in fundamentally new directions. 
Yet how we teach, where we teach, who teaches, and who administers and serves 
have changed only around the edges. This report was made possible by a grant 
from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in connection with its 
grant making initiative on Digital Media and Learning.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>A central finding was that &ldquo;Universities must recognize this new way 
of learning and adapt or risk becoming obsolete. The university model of 
teaching and learning relies on a hierarchy of expertise, disciplinary divides, 
restricted admission to those considered worthy, and a focused, solitary area 
of expertise. However, with participatory learning and digital media, these 
conventional modes of authority break down.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Not coincidentally, one of the ten principles for redesigning learning 
institutions was open source education: &ldquo;Traditional learning 
environments convey knowledge via overwhelmingly copyright-protected 
publications. Networked learning, contrastingly, is an &ldquo;open 
source&rdquo; culture that seeks to share openly and freely in both creating 
and distributing knowledge and products.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;New Book by Pollster John Zogby Says Online Education Is Rapidly 
Gaining&nbsp;Acceptance,&quot; <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, August 12, 
23008 --- 
http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/index.php?id=3236&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>John Zogby, president &amp; CEO of the polling company Zogby International, 
says that American students are quickly warming up to the idea of taking 
classes online, just as consumers have taken to the idea of renting movies via 
Netflix and buying microbrewed beer.</p> 
<p>In a new book by Mr. Zogby released today, he said that polls show a sharp 
increase in acceptance of online education in the past year. For more on the 
story, see  a free article in today&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle.</i> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>National surveys show that a majority of Americans think online 
universities offer a lower quality of education than do traditional 
institutions. But a prominent pollster, John Zogby, says in a book being 
released today that it won't be long before American society takes to distance 
education as warmly as it has embraced game-changing innovations like 
microbrewed beers, Flexcars, and &quot;the simple miracle of Netflix.&quot;</p> 
<p>The factor that will close that &quot;enthusiasm gap&quot; is the growing 
use of distance education by well-respected universities, Mr. Zogby predicts in 
the book,<i>The Way We'll Be: The Zogby Report on the Transformation of the 
American Dream</i>(Random House). </p> 
<p>The book, which is based on Zogby International polls and other studies, 
also touches on public attitudes toward politics, consumer habits, 
spirituality, and international affairs, and on what men and women really do 
want from each other. Mr. Zogby says polls detect signs of society's emerging 
resistance to big institutions, and its de-emphasis on things and places. 
&quot;We're redefining geography and space,&quot; he says&mdash;and a widening 
acceptance of online education is part of the trend.</p> 
<p>Today there is still a &quot;cultural lag&quot; between the public's desire 
for flexible ways to take college courses and what the most-established players 
offer, Mr. Zogby said in an interview with<i>The Chronicle</i> on Monday. 
&quot;There's a sense that those who define the standard haven't caught on 
yet,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>But Mr. Zogby writes that polling by his organization shows that attitudes 
about online education are changing fast. His polling also points to other 
challenges that colleges will face as they race to serve a worldwise generation 
of 18-to-29-year-olds that Mr. Zogby calls &quot;First Globals.&quot;</p> 
<p>In one 2007 poll of more 5,000 adults, Zogby International found that 30 
percent of respondents were taking or had taken an online course, and another 
50 percent said they would consider taking one. He says the numbers might skew 
a little high because this poll was conducted online and the definition of an 
online course was broad, including certificate programs or training modules 
offered by employers.</p> 
<p>Only 27 percent of respondents agreed that &quot;online universities and 
colleges provide the same quality of education&quot; as traditional 
institutions. Among those 18 to 24 years old, only 23 percent agreed.</p> 
<p>An even greater proportion of those polled said it was their perception 
that employers and academic professionals thought more highly of traditional 
institutions than online ones.</p> 
<h4>Rapid Shift in Attitude</h4> 
<p>Yet in another national poll in December 2007, conducted for Excelsior 
College, 45 percent of the 1,004 adults surveyed believed &quot;an online class 
carries the same value as a traditional-classroom class,&quot; and 43 percent 
of 1,545 chief executives and small-business owners agreed that a degree earned 
by distance learning &quot;is as credible&quot; as one from a traditional 
campus-based program.</p> 
<p>Mr. Zogby said that differing attitudes in two polls within a year show 
that &quot;the gap was closing&quot;&mdash;and he said that wasn't as 
surprising as it might seem. As with changing perceptions about other cultural 
phenomena, &quot;these paradigm shifts really are moving at lightning 
speed.&quot;</p> 
<p>That, says Mr. Zogby, is why he writes about online universities in a 
chapter&mdash;&quot;Dematerializing the Paradigm&quot;&mdash;that discusses the 
rise of car-sharing companies like Flexcar (now merged with Zipcar), the 
emergence of Internet blogs as a source of news and information, and the 
popularity of microbrewed beer.</p> 
<p>And while it may be true that microbrews and Zipcars, at least, are still 
very much niche products, Mr. Zogby says they are signs of transcendent 
change&mdash;just like the distance-education courses that are being offered by 
more and more institutions across the country. &quot;When you add up all the 
niche products, it's a market unto itself,&quot; he says.</p> 
<p>In the book, Mr. Zogby also highlights the emerging influence of the First 
Globals, whom his book calls &quot;the most outward-looking and accepting 
generation in American history.&quot; First Globals, he says, are more socially 
tolerant and internationally aware.</p> 
<p>It is these First Globals, he writes, who are shaping what he says is 
nothing short of a &quot;fundamental reorientation of the American character 
away from wanton consumption and toward a new global citizenry in an age of 
limited resources.&quot;</p> 
<p>Higher education, he said in the interview, needs to take notice and adapt. 
These days, he said, students are much more likely to have experienced other 
cultures firsthand, either as tourists or because they have immigrated from 
someplace else. Whether college for them is a traditional complex of buildings 
or an interactive online message board, said Mr. Zogby, &quot;there is a 
different student on campus.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<p>&quot;<b>The Great Debate: Effectiveness of Technology in Education</b>
,&quot; by Patricia Deubel,<i>T.H.E. Journal</i>, November 2007 --- <br>
 
http://www.thejournal.com/articles/21544 </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>According to Robert Kuhn (2000), an expert in brain research, few people 
understand the complexity of that change. Technology is creating new thinking 
that is &quot;at once creative and innovative, volatile and turbulent&quot; and 
&quot;nothing less than a shift in worldview.&quot; The change in mental 
process has been brought about because &quot;(1) information is freely 
available, and therefore interdisciplinary ideas and cross-cultural 
communication are widely accessible; (2) time is compressed, and therefore 
reflection is condensed and decision-making is compacted; (3) individuals are 
empowered, and therefore private choice and reach are strengthened and one 
person can have the presence of an institution&quot; (sec: Concluding Remarks).
</p> 
<p>If we consider thinking as both individual (internal) and social 
(external), as Rupert Wegerif (2000) suggests, then &quot;[t]echnology, in 
various forms from language to the internet, carries the external form of 
thinking. Technology therefore has a role to play through supporting improved 
social thinking (e.g. providing systems to mediate decision making and 
collective reasoning) and also through providing tools to help individuals 
externalize their thinking and so to shape their own social worlds&quot; (p. 
15).</p> 
<p>The new tools for communication that have become part of the 21st century 
no doubt contribute to thinking. Thus, in a debate on effectiveness or on 
implementation of a particular tool, we must also consider the potential for 
creativity, innovation, volatility, and turbulence that Kuhn (2000) indicates.

<p><strong><b>Why All Universities May Be ALN Course &quot;Customers&quot;</b>
</strong></p> 
<p>Before reading this section, you may want to take a brief look at <strong>
The Web of Asynchronous Learning Networks</strong>.</p> 
<p>Synchronous education in a scheduled sequence of classes will face serious 
new competition of asynchronous education distributed on networks where 
students learn and communicate most any day and most any time of day and study 
at their own paces. An example is the new online Western Governors University at
http://www.wgu.edu/ .&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all western states are part of WGU and 
some states east of the Mississippi River (e.g., Indiana) are investigating how 
to join up. &nbsp; Another example is California Virtual University.&nbsp; 
Sherri Moore sent me the following message:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>July 22, 1998<br>
 Please consider adding a link from your Web site to the 
California Virtual University athttp://www.california.edu</p> 
<p>The CVU integrates into one site on the Internet the online and 
technology-mediated classes of 92 accredited California colleges and 
universities, including Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley and USC. In total, more 
than 1,600 courses are available.</p> 
<p>Visitors to the CVU Web site can register to be notified by e-mail when new 
courses are added by accredited California campuses. The course notification 
system can be personalized to match specific interest areas. The CVU is a 
tremendous resource for anyone seeking education online.</p> 
<p>Thank you for considering this request<br>
 Moore, Sherri 
[SMoore@VUDesign.ca.gov]</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Update in April 1999</strong><br>
California Virtual University 
will cease operations as an independent distance-education institution, 
following reluctance on the part of the venture&#146;s partners&#151;the 
state&#146;s three public-college systems and the association of independent 
colleges&#151;to put up $1 million a year for the next three years to cover 
operating costs. CVU will retain its searchable Web site &lt;
http://www.california.edu&gt;, which lists available courses at more than 100 
participating colleges and universities. Funding already received by CVU, 
including $250,000 from the Alfred P. Sloan foundation and $375,000 from 
corporate sponsorships, has already been spent, in part on developing the Web 
site. CEO Stanley Chodorow said in a mid-March e-mail message that &quot;We 
just did not have enough fuel to get up to takeoff speed.&quot; (<em>Chronicle 
of Higher Education</em> 2 Apr 99)</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Ideally, faculty or other expert help is available online to both help 
students and evaluate student work and ideas. In addition, asynchronous courses 
may schedule synchronous virtual online meetings of subsets of students or 
entire classes of students. Networked courses may thus be synchronous and 
asynchronous, although the technical learning components are largely 
asynchronous.</p> 
<p>The largest growth opportunities in learning and education lie in networked 
courses and programs. Everybody expects high-prestige &quot;vendor&quot; 
universities and corporations to invest in ALN courses and market them based 
upon vendor name recognition (e.g., MIT or AT&amp;T). Eventually, all 
universities may become &quot;customers&quot; for ALN courses developed at 
other universities.<b> Even universities that sell an ALN course in one 
discipline may contract to purchase an ALN course in another discipline.</b>The 
main reason will be the need to fill gaps in curricula with more courses than 
can be feasibly developed and delivered by resident faculty. Current gaps will 
be more visible as online education opportunities become more popular due to a 
wide array of specialty courses not presently found in most traditional 
curricula.</p> 
<p>Although US News and World Report and Money Magazine have both given 
Trinity University the distinction of being Number 1 in its classification 
(Western Region), there are gaps in the teeth of its curriculum. There are gaps 
in the curriculum of literally every university, and the gaps are more serious 
in smaller universities that try to live up to coverage across multiple 
disciplines implied by the term &quot;university.&quot;</p> 
<p>For example, the Business Administration program at Trinity University 
needs to introduce curriculum coverage of newer business technology courses 
that are not feasible to develop and administer with existing faculty. We 
especially need to add elective courses in specialized areas. Examples of the 
types of specialties are listed later on in this paper. Adding new faculty and 
course coverage in an array of varied specialties is not deemed an option in 
the foreseeable future.</p> 
<p>A factor in ALN use is hardware, software, and instructor abilities to 
handle ALN. Potential advantages of ALN in existing courses are so monumental 
that most campuses are experimenting with ALN at the moment and contemplating 
more widespread deployment for existing courses. Advantages and disadvantages 
of doing so are discussed in 
http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245ch02.htm#Asynchronous1. </p> 
<p>Advantages include the following and are elaborated for computer aided 
learning (CAL) athttp://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245ch02.htm#Advantages4:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>The main advantages of asynchronous CAL are that student learning is 
self-paced and interactive.<br>
</li> 
<li>Educators can experiment in creative ways using unique and intriguing WWW 
sites.<br>
</li> 
<li>Other advantages are remote delivery of cost-efficient and conveniently 
distributed &quot;virtual&quot; courses.<br>
</li> 
<li>Cross-cultural and cross-functional teams of students can be formed in 
virtual education and research.<br>
</li> 
<li>Networked learning combines fun and education for students as they surf 
the Internet in teams or on their own.<br>
</li> 
<li>Colleges are expanding their markets with CAL in lifelong learning 
programs.<br>
</li> 
<li>Both better student performance and higher evaluations of instructors can 
result.<br>
</li> 
<li>You must ultimately adopt new learning technologies in your courses and 
program curricula..<br>
</li> 
<li>You can experiment with paperless courses.<br>
</li> 
<li>You can become a part of a world wide movement of researchers 
experimenting with new and creative ways to utilize modern technology in 
education.<br>
</li> 
<li>Accounting educators can react to appeals of the Accounting Education 
Change Commission.<br>
</li> 
<li>You will find funding sources for technology research and application 
increasing at a much faster rate in the future.<br>
</li> 
<li>You may discover that new technology can lead to more cross-discipline 
research and applications.<br>
</li> 
<li>You can avoid teaching toward obsolescence.<br>
</li> 
<li>You can play a greater part in developing and sharing learning materials 
with professors and students in foreign nations, notably underdeveloped nations.
</li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>Ways to Avoid the Disadvantages of Asynchronous Modules and<br>
 Courses 
are listed below for computer aided learning (CAL) and elaborated upon in 
greater detail athttp://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245ch02.htm#Ways2</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Try to resist temptations to dehumanize some courses by eliminating 
face-to-face encounters.<br>
</li> 
<li>Asynchronous CAL can be extremely effective for learning technical 
material before coming to class. However, be reasonable about the time expected 
for network learning outside of class.<br>
</li> 
<li>Delete as well as add material with each revision (or create optional 
rather than required links to material of less importance in the course).<br>

</li> 
<li>Obtain student feedback on CAL modules.<br>
</li> 
<li>Avoid requiring rote memorization of CAL online material.<br>
</li> 
<li>Try to avoid getting the image of being a computer hacker more interested 
in the machines per se than what they can do for your teaching and research.<br>
</li> 
<li>Remember that it is usually more important to inspire students to want to 
learn than it is to have them learn technical content in any particular course.
<br> </li> 
<li>Remember the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) rule.<br>
</li> 
<li>Try to attain face-to-face socialization benefits in virtual universities.
<br> </li> 
<li>There are risks of obvious and not-so-obvious copyright violations even in 
uncontrolled distributions on CDs, intranets, and the WWW.<br>
</li> 
<li>There are risks of copyright violations due to uncertainties in Education 
Fair Use Laws covering new technologies.<br>
</li> 
<li>Research on effectiveness of CAL is often futile due to the pace of 
technological change, the variation in learning ingredients, and Hawthorne 
effects.</li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>Results of some experiments in virtual learning at Texas Christian 
University are reported at http://zeta.is.tcu.edu/~blobert/vle/project.html.</p>
<p>When ALN becomes more widely deployed in existing courses, it becomes much 
easier to expand the curriulum by &quot;buying into&quot; selected off-campus 
ALN courses from other colleges and universities.</p>

<p><strong><b>Bridging the Gaps</b></strong></p> 
<p>At a recent Department of Business Administration faculty meeting 
considering how to add more technology courses, I suggested that we look into 
contracting for ALN courses emerging in other universities, business 
corporations, and public accounting firms. My suggestion was met with extreme 
skepticism by faculty at the present time. However, I predict that by Year 2010 
a significant proportion of required and elective courses will be globally 
networked by universities and business firms. Vendors having solid gold name 
recognition for quality will probably have a competitive advantage in 
distributing ALN courses.</p> 
<p>Delivery will not be in the form of the dying synchronous distance 
education classes transmitted to remote sites by television. Instead it will be 
in the form of largely asynchronous networked courses on the Internet or 
intranets. Many of those networked courses will have such prestige &quot;brand 
names&quot; of Stanford University, MIT, Harvard University, Princeton 
University, Northwestern University, University of Michigan, University of 
Texas, University of Illinois, etc. Of course, organizations with less brand 
recognition may offer selected ALN courses of outstanding quality. Some 
Internet courses may be given by television networks who face a shrinking 
market as viewers move to the web. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television 
networking of adult education and degree programs is now moving to the web (see
http://www.pbs.org/learn/). Still other courses are available from prominent 
consulting and accounting firms such as EDS, Andersen Consulting, Arthur D. 
Little, Price Waterhouse, Ernst &amp; Young, PriceWaterhouse Coopers, Deloitte 
and Touche, etc. There are now over 1,600 corporate colleges and universities, 
most of which are gearing up for online delivery and full accreditation of 
their courses and degree programs. A rising number of these corporate 
universities already have brand recognition like General Electric, Motorola, 
AT&amp;T, etc.</p> 
<p>Junk bond king Michael Milken is putting together a virtual education 
training empire known as Knowledge Universe.&nbsp; To date, Knowledge Universe 
has invested multimillions of dollars to acquire and build an online 
educational empire that will challenge schools ranging from local elementary 
schools to Ivy League universities.&nbsp; The goal, according to Milken, is to 
use computers and networking technologies to make education and training 
available virtually anywhere in the world. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Corporate universities are not a new idea. However, their explosive growth 
in the networking technology paradigm shift is a new phenomenon that makes it 
possible for traditional universities to bridge curricula gaps. Corporate 
university programs will increasingly compete with traditional universities for 
entire degree programs. The McGraw-Hill giant publishing conglomerate has

<p><b>Explosion of Corporate/University Partnerships</b></p> 
<p>&quot;E-learning Demand to Double in 2005,&quot; <i>SmartPros</i>, January 
7, 2004 ---http://www.smartpros.com/x46477.xml&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Demand for online courses will almost double in 2005, as professionals and 
companies realize e-learning's distinct advantages, according to officials at 
RedVector.com, a Tampa-based company that offers online courses to 
professionals involved in the design and construction industries.</p> 
<p>A recent survey of RedVector.com clients indicates professionals and 
corporate leaders had different reasons for adopting online education. 
Professionals cited the variety and depth of course offerings while corporate 
leaders cited cost savings and relevance of courses to business goals.</p> 
<p>Recent research indicates the entire online professional education industry 
may experience similar growth in 2005:</p> 
<p>Spending on online continuing education passed the $9 billion mark in 2003, 
according to IDC Research, and grew to between $12 and 14 billion in 2004, 
according to Bersin and Associates. IDC predicts a 30 percent increase in 
yearly e-learning spending worldwide through 2008. The number of companies 
using online learning to train employees will grow by 50 percent in 2005, 
according to Bersin and Associates. Economics has been a driving force behind 
growth in online professional education. With online courses, companies no 
longer have to pay travel and hotel costs and employees can be more productive 
since they aren't spending time traveling.</p> 
<p>Growth in online learning is also driven by specialization in course 
offerings. According to the Distance Education and Training Council, more than 
500 companies and organizations now offer online courses focusing on specific 
industries and professions.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
Some universities have programs dedicated to particular firms such as 
the Ernst and Young's employee masters degree programs (University of Virginia 
and Notre Dame) and PwC's employee MBA program at the University of 
Georgia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I made a presentation at the University of Georgia on November 13, 
1998 my afternoon audience was comprised of faculty members in college of 
Business (including former FASB Chairman Denny Beresford) who are teaching in 
the online MBA Program resulting from a partnering of the University of Georgia 
and PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PWC). All students in the program take this 
graduate degree program online while continuing to work for PWC (mainly in the 
consulting division). While I was in Athens on November 12, Denny invited me to 
sit in on a session in which the program faculty discussed such things as heavy 
messaging that often results from delivering courses asynchronously.</p> 
<p>The partnership mentioned above is one of many in a rising trend of 
partnerships between corporations and universities for delivery of online and 
on-campus degree programs. An excellent review of this trend is given by Jeanne 
C. Meister in a book entitled<i>Corporate Universities</i> (McGraw Hill 
Companies, 1998). The book is reviewed in<i>T.H.E. Journal</i>, October 1998, 
pp. 20-26. An online version of the review article temporarily available at
http://www.thejournal.com/magazine/current/news.asp </p> 
<p>I suggest that you download the above file before it disappears from the 
web. Among the interesting passages from Jeanne Meister is the following 
passage (which she elaborates upon in the book):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;It's the way we've always done things&quot; must be changed to 
recognize that the educational process must focus less on the adult lecturer 
and more on the student learner. This shift in mindset will foster increased 
responsibility on the part of learners to take charge of their own learning and 
hence their careers. Based upon our interviews with scores of corporate 
university deans and deans of graduate business schools as well as continuing 
education, we have identified four types of corporate/college partnerships as 
best practice examples. These include: thedevelopment of customized executive 
educational programs, the creation of customized degree programs, the formation 
of a learning partner consortium and finally, in some cases, actual 
accreditation of the corporate university.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>The explosion of corporate universities and corporate partnerships with 
traditional universities offers many new opportunities and challenges. This 
explosion offers all sorts of non-traditional career paths for educators, 
especially educators interested in development of learning materials for online 
courses. There are also some concerns at are mentioned below at

<p><b>The Controversial Ernst&amp;Young and PriceWaterhouse Coopers<br>
 
Funded Masters Degree Programs</b></p> 
<p>Will this become the masters degree in accounting model for all top 
accounting firms and large business firms in the future?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will more 
private firms like&nbsp;Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y)&nbsp; and PriceWaterhouse 
Coopers (PWC) partner with one or more&nbsp; traditional universities and fund 
a customized program in which the firms are a heavy players in calendar, work 
load, and student admission decisions?&nbsp; Students in most cases will be 
existing or incoming employees of the firms.</p> 
<p>PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PWC) has a  custom MBA program leading to an MBA 
degree from the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business with the 
following attributes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1. Students in the program are all full-time employees of PWC.</p> 
<p>2. The program is online in an asynchronous mode.</p> 
<p>3. The University of Georgia designs and delivers the courses with 
full-time faculty.</p> 
<p>4. PWC pays the tuition and other fees.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>The PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PWC) MBA program is not quite as controversial 
as the E&amp;Y Master Plan.&nbsp; PWC's program is aimed mostly at existing 
consulting division employees and is not used as heavily as a recruiting 
enticement for graduating students. It is aimed at employees who probably were 
not even business majors. It leads to an MBA degree and does not compete with 
masters of accounting programs. It does not lead up to taking the CPA 
examination. It also involves many fewer students than the new E&amp;Y program 
at Notre Dame and the University of Virginia.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless it does suffer from some of the controversies such as the role 
it plays in admission of students, its role in setting workloads of employees 
who are working while taking the customized program, and the use of faculty and 
facilities that are heavily subsidized by taxpayers if the participating 
university is state supported.&nbsp; Even in the case of private univeristies, 
private industry is benefitting from the tax exempt status of the university 
delivering the customized program for the firm's employees.</p> 
<p>I cannot even find a web site discussing the PWC MBA program at the PWC web 
site. You can read about it at<br>
http://www.cba.uga.edu/mba/home/deanbio.html 
</p> 
<p>Two universities are participating in the E&amp;Y customized program. The 
program is an employment fringe benefit and even provides income ($1,000 per 
month) in addition to tuition, fees, room, board, and books.&nbsp; In the 
September through April period, students can live at home, take two distance 
education courses while earning a full-time E&amp;Y&nbsp; salary that is not 
limited to $1,000 per month.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y) has a funded customized program leading to an 
Masters of Accounting degree from the the University of Notre Dame or the 
University of Virginia. The web site is at<br>

http://www.ey.com/careers/masters/default.asp </p> 
<p>Notre Dame's web site of interest is at 
http://www.nd.edu/~acctdept/careers.htm#2</p> 
<p>My interests in the Ernst &amp; Young partnerships with Notre Dame and the 
University of Virginia are somewhat different than my interest in the PWC MBA 
partnership. In the first place, an E&amp;Y partnership does not entail 
networked learning in a heavy way. Two of the ten required courses are distance 
education courses delivered in remote E&amp;Y offices while students are 
working full time.&nbsp; Those two courses are synchronous rather than 
asynchronous on the web.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Readiness Program and&nbsp; eight 
graduate courses meet in traditional classroom settings while students are in 
residence on the university campuses.</p> 
<p>My interest in the E&amp;Y masters degree programs is focused mainly upon 
the combination of student recruitment, curriculum design, and the way that 
program at first seemed to me to be doing something that is impossible. What 
seemed impossible to me were the following points that I concluded immediately 
after reading the packet of materials being sent to universities to distribute 
to undergraduate students and the information at the E&amp;Y web site on 
&quot;The Master Plan&quot; athttp://www.ey.com/careers/masters/default.asp </p>
<ol> 
<ol> 
<li>The program mixes former accounting majors having 10 or more courses in 
accounting with other business majors having as few as two courses in basic 
accounting.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>Students who are not former accounting majors must attend a 
five-week&nbsp; Readiness Program that provides 10 credits of undergraduate 
accounting credit.<br>
</li> 
<li>The custom E&amp;Y program is a lock-step program for all students and 
does not have separate tracks for accounting versus non-accounting 
majors.&nbsp; E&amp;Y will not fund taking of additional undergraduate 
accounting courses other than those provided in the five-week Readiness Program.
<br> </li> 
<li>After taking ten courses for 30 credits from Notre Dame or UVA, the 
capstone course is a non-credit CPA Review Course delivered by E&amp;Y 
instructors.<br>
</li> </ol> </ol> 
<p>The fact that the masters degrees are designated as accounting degrees and 
that the capstone course is the CPA Review course, leads students and people 
like me into believing that these degrees enable graduates from the E&amp;Y 
program to sit for the CPA examination. Although many of us that teach in 
universities having some form of masters programs in accounting try to some 
extent to avoid having the CPA examination dictate our curricula, we generally 
do make it possible for our graduates to meet the minimum requirements to sit 
for the CPA examination in our own states and many other states.</p> 
<p>The Masters in Accounting degree is free in the sense that E&amp;Y pays a 
salary plus providing funding for all tuition, fees, room, board, and travel 
costs. In return, the student is indentured for three years and must repay the 
education costs if he or she should voluntarily leave E&amp;Y before the three 
year commitment is satisfied.</p> 
<p>What concerned me more than any other thing in all of this was a claim made 
(in the student application form and at the E&amp;Y web site) that reads as 
follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;We worked with the universities to ensure that the Master's Program 
offers you the best education through a schedule which also allows you to 
develop skills and knowledge to prepare you to excel at Ernst &amp; Young.&quot;
</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>This said to me that this program and its curriculum plan were &quot;the 
best&quot; vis-&agrave;-vis what students can get from other masters programs 
in accounting, including our program at Trinity University.&nbsp; There was no 
detailed curriculum information available on the E&amp;Y program, but it 
appeared to me that given the five things enumerated above, it would be 
impossible to accomplish such our own program for students not having more 
accounting prerequisites.</p> 
<p>Admittedly, I jumped to some erroneous conclusions prior to learning more 
about the E&amp;Y Master Plan curriculum. Belatedly, it now appears to me that 
graduates from the E&amp;Y program will not be allowed to sit for the CPA 
examination in Texas and some other states unless they take nearly an extra 
year of accounting coursework before or after completing the masters in 
accounting degree program funded by E&amp;Y.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I sent my first message about the E&amp;Y Master Plan to the aecm list 
serve and expressed some of my off-the-wall concerns in my web document at
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#ErnstandYoung . Those two things 
resulted in email messages from various educators, including messages from 
Notre Dame faculty members Tom Frecka and Kevin Mislewicz. I reproduced Tom's 
message in the above web document.</p> 
<p>Kevin's message was less detailed, but it did give me my first insight into 
the curriculum. Kevin informed me that the E&amp;Y Master Plan's curriculum 
differs only slightly fromM.S. in Accountancy curriculum that Notre Dame offers 
to students in its regular program.&nbsp; The main difference is the 
lock-step&nbsp; calendar for the E&amp;Y Master Plan and possibly fewer choices 
due to the customized E&amp;Y calendar. That calendar reads as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Mar-April (Preparing): CD-ROM Review Course on Introductory Accounting<br>
 
May-June (Home&amp;EY): Readiness Program for non-accounting majors (10 credits)
<br> June-Aug (University): Core Program on campus (9 credits)<br>
 Sept-Aug 
(Home&amp;EY): Distance Learning (3 credits, one night per week)<br>
 Jan-April 
(Home&amp;EY): Distance Learning (3 credits, one night per week)<br>
 June-Aug 
(University): Core Program on campus (15 credits)<br>
 Aug-Nov (Home&amp;EY): 
CPA Review Program</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>The E&amp;Y Master Plan curriculum plan at Notre Dame is shown below:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> <b></b> 
<p><b></b><strong>Summer, 1999 </strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Negotiations/Communication</p> 
<p>Taxes and Business Strategy </p> 
<p>Financial Statement Analysis (same as MBA elective) </p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Fall, 1999 Distance Learning (Synchronous)</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Finance (Investments, same as MBA elective) </p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Spring, 2000 Distance Learning (Syncrhronous)</strong></p> 
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Summer, 2000 </strong></p> 
<blockquote>

<p>Special Topics in Financial Reporting (securitization, derivatives, 
hedging,...)</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>Advanced Finance Course (still being developed) </p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Advanced Technology Course (to be developed jointly by ND, UVA and E&amp;Y) 
</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>TOTAL GRADUATE CREDIT HOURS = 30</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Non-accounting majors will also receive 10 undergraduate credits 
for the Readiness Program</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Financial accounting (4.5 credits)</p> 
<p>Managerial accounting (2.0 credits)</p> 
<p>Auditing (2.0 credits)</p> 
<p>Taxation (1.5 credits)<b></b></p><b> </b> </blockquote> <b></b> 
<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>The above Financial Reporting &amp; Assurance Services curriculum appears 
to me to be an outstanding curriculum for former accounting majors. It also 
appears to be an outstanding curriculum for non-accounting majors since there 
does not appear to be all that much accounting in the program, at least not to 
the point where prerequisites in intermediate accounting, income taxes, 
auditing, and managerial accounting are necessary. &nbsp; However, for 
non-accounting majors there is a major drawback relative to virtually all 
masters of accounting programs in the U.S.&nbsp; In many states, especially 
Texas, the graduates would not meet the requirements, in my judgment, to apply 
to sit for the CPA examination. &nbsp; If taking the CPA is important to such a 
graduate and passing it is important for career advancement in E&amp;Y, the 
non-accounting graduate from Notre Dame will have to take more accounting 
courses just to sit for the CPA examination unless he or she can sit for the 
examination in some state that has less explicit application requirements than 
Texas.&nbsp; The Texas requirements include30 credits beyond basic accounting 
courses that cover the following::</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Intermediate Accounting</p> 
<p>Advanced Accounting</p> 
<p>Auditing, Internal Accounting Control and Evaluation</p> 
<p>Financial Statement Analysis</p> 
<p>Accounting Theory</p> 
<p>Not-for Profit Accounting</p> 
<p>Six credits of Income Tax</p> 
<p>Accounting Systems</p> 
<p>Accounting Report Writing</p> 
<p>Other recommended courses and areas are suggested in the law</p> 
</blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>At this point in time, I must assume that the UVA curriculum for the 
E&amp;Y Master Plan will be somewhat similar to the Notre Dame 
curriculum.&nbsp; I viewed the curriculum for regular students not part of the 
E&amp;Y program at
http://www.commerce.virginia.edu/ms_accounting/requirements.htm . That 
curriculum is a much more traditional master of accountancy curriculum than the 
above Notre Dame curriculum.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I cannot imagine business 
majors having only one or two basic accounting courses entering that UVA 
curriculum without taking intermediate accounting and some other prerequisite 
accounting modules.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most certainly I cannot imagine such students 
being mixed in with former accounting majors in many of the listed UVA graduate 
accounting courses. At this point, however, my comments are restricted to the 
above Notre Dame curriculum.</p>

<p>Bob, </p> 
<p>Just read the stuff about the program on your web site. Thought I might set 
the record straight on a few points:</p> </blockquote> 
<ol> 
<li>The program is for both undergraduate accounting majors and for 
non-accounting undergraduate business majors. The latter group will start with 
the Readiness Program. I don&#146;t consider this very 
&quot;controversial.&quot;</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Comment from Bob Jensen:<br>
It is controversial to the extent that 
some states require 21 to 24 credits of content that is traditionally covered 
at the undergraduate level. &nbsp; Since you only offer 10 undergraduate credts 
of undergradutate accounting content, I do not see how it will be possible for 
graduates of your program to meet the requirements to take the CPA examination 
in states like Texas.</strong>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>The E&amp;Y program is also controversial in that E&amp;Y does not 
provide funding for this program for any of its employees at any colleges or 
universities other than Notre Dame and the University of Virginia.&nbsp; To my 
knowledge, other universities were not even given a chance to bid on this 
program.&nbsp; It might be noted that unlike the E&amp;Y and PWC programs, all 
universities have a chance of receiving funding for the new KPMG program that 
funds a Masters of Taxation degree for employess in the tax division.</strong>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>(2) Students will continue to consider employment at other firms. In order 
to receive &quot;free&quot; tuition, the E&amp;Y students must remain with the 
firm for three years. If they leave, they will need to reimburse E&amp;Y for 
the pro-rated cost of the program. I presume that many students will not want 
to incur this liability.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
<strong>Comment from Bob Jensen:<br>
 Yes but the E&amp;Y funded 
masters degree is a fringe benefit not being offered by any other firm as part 
of the plan to recruit undergraduate students.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other firms may have 
to join this band wagon just to compete for top students</strong>.<strong>
&nbsp; Since most new hires hope to stay with a large public accounting firm 
for at least three years, the three year indenture is no big deal.&nbsp; I 
assume that if they are terminated by E&amp;Y, their debt for the masters 
degree is waived.&nbsp; In reality, the E&amp;Y Master Plan is one of the 
largest fringe benefits in the history of public accounting firms.&nbsp; For 
all practical purposes it is even more than a &quot;free&quot; masters 
degree.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>One question that comes to mind is how this fringe will be taxed by 
the IRS?&nbsp; That will be a major bite not anticipated my many 
applicants.&nbsp; The tax implications should be mentioned in the E&amp;Y 
application for the program.</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(3) Both Notre Dame and UVA have signed a Letter of Understanding with 
E&amp;Y. The agreement gives both schools complete control over the curriculum. 
In our case, it was important for us to have a curriculum that was exactly 
consistent with the requirements for our existing M.S.in Accountancy Degree 
Program. We also have complete control over admission decisions and students 
are expected to follow all of the Notre Dame rules.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Comment from Bob Jensen:<br>
 When I posted my earlier concerns, I 
thought you were constrained by the requirement in many states that students 
have 30 or more hours of accounting to sit for the CPA examination and 
particular accounting, auditing, tax, and systems courses.&nbsp; Now I realize 
that you are not constrained by this requirement.&nbsp; It appears that 
graduates from your M.S. in Accounting program will not be able to sit for the 
CPA examination unless they take more accounting courses other than accounting 
courses you require in the program and as prerequisites for the program.
</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>(4) Distance learning courses will be taught by faculty at ND and UVA. </p> 
<p>In our case, we have a great deal of experience with distance learning, 
particularly in our Executive Programs. In fact, our program won an award for 
best distance learning in higher education last year.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Comment from Bob Jensen:<br>
 I have never questioned the quality 
or integrity of the University of Notre Dame or UVA</strong>. <strong>These are 
very presitigious programs.&nbsp; I have featured the BAM program at UVA in a 
document athttp://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/265wp.htm .&nbsp; In my technology 
workshops I rate Notre Dame's business school faculty and building among the 
most advanced programs I know of in technology applications.</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>(5) Our program is not comprised of more accounting courses than competing 
programs. The program is designed to meet AACSB accreditation standards and 150 
laws that limit the amount of accounting included in such programs. RE 
communication/speech courses, our program includes a required 
negotiations/communication course and a required consulting course. Re the CPA 
exam, our program should cover the requisite accounting material, but CPA 
review is E&amp;Y/the participants&#146; responsibilities, not ours.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>Thank you for this clarification.&nbsp; In my earlier concerns I 
thought that you were intending to make students eligible to sit for the CPA 
examination and would offer a more traditional masters of accounting program 
that had more accounting prerequisites and/or more accounting courses required 
in the program.&nbsp; Now I realize that your program is not intended to make 
students elgible to sit for the CPA examination in many states.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>(6)&nbsp; There will be no undergraduate accounting material covered in the 
30 credit hour degree program.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Comments from Bob Jensen:<br>
This is both a strength and a 
weakness.&nbsp; It is tough to mix former accounting majors with non-accounting 
majors who have only had a five week Readiness Program.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I would appreciate it if you would correct the erroneous impressions 
conveyed by your article.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Comment from Bob Jensen:<br>
 I have added you message to the web 
document so that your concerns are fully stated in your own words.&nbsp; I 
apologize for jumping to the conclusion that you were trying to offer a 
curriculum that enables students to sit for the CPA examination in virtually 
all states.</strong></p>

<p>Deere Contracts With Indiana University for Online MBA Degrees in Finance
</p> 
<p>&quot;Deere &amp; Company Turns to Indiana University's Kelley School of 
Business For Online MBA Degrees in Finance,&quot; Yahoo Press Release, October 
8, 2001 ---http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/011008/cgm034_1.html&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>MOLINE, Ill., Oct. 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Deere &amp; Company, the world's 
leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment, has entered into a Web-based 
academic partnership with Indiana University's Kelley School of Business to 
provide a Master of Business Administration degree program for Deere's finance 
professionals, beginning in August 2002.</p> 
<p>The customized online program is designed as a three-year course of study 
to be completed in parallel with the participants' full-time job 
responsibilities. Course content is centered around the business knowledge, 
technical skills, and behavioral competencies for Deere's future leaders to use 
in responding to challenges facing the company. Kelley's senior faculty 
designed the program specifically for John Deere, with input from the Deere 
finance division's senior management team.</p> 
<p>``This is a rigorous program drawing from the strengths of both the Kelley 
School and the Deere management team. It is designed to create value for our 
enterprise and allow us to attract and retain high-quality employees,'' said 
Nate Jones, chief financial officer at Deere &amp; Company. ``Graduates of this 
program will learn skills that help them better meet the challenges of 
improving business performance and delivering value to shareholders.''</p> 
<p>``The Kelley School of Business takes pride in its ability to build 
curricula,'' said Dan Dalton, dean of the Kelley School. ``Our faculty's talent 
in educational innovation enables us to create close relationships with the 
corporate community and construct programs according to their specific 
criteria. We are delighted to extend this ability to include a corporation with 
the integrity and strong international reputation of John Deere.''</p> 
<p>The MBA program curriculum will consist of twenty courses structured to 
meld individual student goals with the organizational needs of Deere &amp; 
Company. Each academic year will consist of three twelve-week sessions. The 
program will be launched each year with a one- to two- week residential module 
on Indiana University's Bloomington campus.</p> 
<p>Teaching tools will include discussion and debate forums, on-line testing, 
audio streaming and video streaming, simulations, and time-revealed scenarios 
for case-based learning. Course materials may be accessed directly from the 
Worldwide Web. The program will use only full-time tenure-track faculty 
recognized for their quality of teaching in other Kelley School programs.</p> 
<p>The John Deere MBA program is a customized adaptation of the Kelley Direct 
Online MBA program, which is the first fully online MBA offered among 
nationally ranked top-20 business schools. It has been available since 1999 to 
qualified working professionals who continue their employment while earning 
their degrees. It was created in collaboration with the Kelley School's 
corporate executive education clients, who voiced a need for MBA skills 
throughout their work forces. About 150 students are enrolled in the Kelley 
Direct Online MBA program today.</p> </blockquote>

As online learning spreads throughout higher education, so have calls for 
quality control and assessment. Accrediting groups are scrambling to keep up, 
and Congress and government officials continue to scrutinize the high 
student-loan default rates and aggressive recruiting tactics of some 
for-profit, mostly online colleges. But the push for accountability isn't 
coming just from outside. More colleges are looking inward, conducting their

<p><b>ABSTRACT </b><br>
 The benefits of online collaborative learning, 
sometimes referred to as CSCL (computer-supported collaborative learning) are 
compelling, but many instructors are loath to experiment with non-conventional 
methods of teaching and learning because of the perceived problems. This paper 
reviews the existing literature to present the seven most commonly reported 
such problems of online group learning, as identified by both researchers and 
practitioners, and offers practical solutions to each, in the hope that 
educators may be encouraged to &ldquo;take the risk&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&quot;<b>Better Learning With Sites and Sound</b>,&quot; by Andy Guess, <i>
Inside Higher Ed</i>, December 3, 2008 ---  
http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/12/03/audio </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Students in four graduate courses at West Virginia University worked on and 
submitted group projects in two different ways, alternating for each 
assignment: using Microsoft Word to save, track changes, add comments and send 
files back and forth as e-mail attachments; and sharing files and editing them 
online using Buzzword. According to the study, the students &ldquo;were more 
likely to use graphics, charts, links, etc. in Buzzword because of the ease of 
inclusion&rdquo; than in Word, possibly as a function of the interface&rsquo;s 
comparative ease of use.</p> 
<p>Perhaps more significantly, the study found that they were &ldquo;more 
likely to explain more complex concepts using a combination of text and 
non-text based materials. The majority of participants ... expressed the view 
that it was easier to express themselves at a higher cognitive level when they 
could present material using multiple media sources.&rdquo; They also had 
higher levels of satisfaction.</p> 
<p>Although the study had a small sample size, Ice suggested in an interview 
that the &ldquo;multiple forms of sensory input&rdquo; such as charts, links 
and graphics not only make the information more understandable to the reader 
&ldquo;but apparently ... students are learning more from that process as 
well&quot;; a process that&rsquo;s not too different from the wiki editing 
experience. He is preparing a larger follow-up study with at least six 
different institutions around the world.</p> 
<p>In theory, then, collaborations using Web-based editing tools can 
potentially boost understanding, at least visually. </p> 
<p>But learning doesn&rsquo;t just occur in the visual realm. Ice co-authored 
a study, currently under review, that examines how listening to spoken words 
while also reading at the same time can improve students&rsquo; learning 
experiences. In particular, he and his colleagues attempted a method in which 
professors record comments on students&rsquo; written assignments, which 
students can then listen to as they read along at corresponding points in the 
text. They can also record their own responses and continue back and forth in a 
sort of audio conversation.</p> 
<p>While the Web-based collaboration tools are free, Ice&rsquo;s method makes 
use of embedded audio features in Adobe Acrobat Pro. If institutions own the 
software, however, students can listen to the audio (and record their own 
additions) on the free and commonly used Acrobat Reader. (Adobe provided 60 
copies of Acrobat Pro for the study but no additional funding or support.)</p> 
<p>The forthcoming paper found that students in the audio study were at least 
three times more likely to take professors&rsquo; comments into account in 
their final assignments if they were in audio form as opposed to written. What 
they found, Ice said, was that &ldquo;students are actually listening to the 
instructor and reading what they wrote so they have two sensory modes working 
at the same time,&rdquo; which could actually improve cognition.</p> 
<p>Since the paper was produced, Ice added, additional research has confirmed 
that the findings are generalizable over many different contexts, such as types 
of learners and types of institutions.</p> 
<p>But a central component of the effect is what the authors call the 
&ldquo;asynchronous audio feedback&rdquo; aspect of the comments: that students 
can listen to previously recorded audio while they&rsquo;re reading what it is 
referring to.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried other methods, too, where you send the students a 
document and then also send them a [separate] sound file, and the effect is not 
nearly as strong; as a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s barely significant when you 
do that,&rdquo; Ice said.</p>

<p>The tools mentioned by at the by Andrew Wadsworth at 
http://talon.extramural.uiuc.edu/ws97/intro/tsld033.htm include the following:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p><strong>Print</strong> --- good ALN courses may not be entirely 
paperless.&nbsp; W.&nbsp; Crawford and M. Garnow state (as quoted by Eli Noam in
<em>Educom Review</em>, March/April 1998, p. 18)</p> 
<p>Print is not dead. <br>
 Print is not dying.<br>
 Print is not even vaguely 
ill.</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p><strong>Videotape</strong> --- this is still cheaper than storage and 
transmission of high volumes of digitized video, although random access, 
searching, and freezing on frames are huge limitations.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Audiotape</strong> --- this is still cheaper than storage and 
transmission of high volumes of digitized audio, although random access, 
searching, and freezing on frames are huge limitations.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Email </strong> --- email and the Internet comprise the core 
technologies of ALN communications. Cost, efficiency and ease of use have no 
equals to email and the Internet. The main drawback of email is that responding 
to email communication is labor intensive (humans still answer the messages) 
and there are no volume controls other than refusals to answer all or certain 
types of email messaging. WalMart, for example, naively installed a customer 
email answering service only to discover that the flow of message become a 
roaring stream that was overwhelming. Very few retail corporations openly 
respond to more than a small fraction of email messages. Many conceal email 
addresses of employees.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Voice Mail</strong> --- this can reach users and educators at times 
when they do not have access to computers.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Bulletin Board System (BBS)</strong> - the electronic version of a 
cork board with tacked messages. The electronic version, however, is easier to 
search and index.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Facsimile or FAX</strong> - with advances in email that allow for 
graphics, audio, and other file attachments, FAX technologies are losing out to 
modern email. However, for many organizations (such a Microsoft, Dell, etc.) 
cannot handle email traffic, so that sometimes the only way to transmit 
facsimiles is via FAX, postal services, or other express mail services.</p> 
</li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Internet and the World Wide Web</strong> - email and the Internet 
comprise the core technologies of ALN communications. Cost, efficiency and ease 
of use have no equals to email and the Internet. A drawback of the world wide 
web, however, is flow capacity (bandwidth) that can make transmissions very 
slow. Also there are huge differences between being connected to arteries 
(e.g., T1 lines) versus capillaries (modems). Students on campus have 
tremendous comparative advantages if they can use arteries and avoid the 
capillaries to households outside the campus. Some advocates of ALN having 
great successes with ALN on campus may not have the same success with modem 
users.</p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To Wadsworth's list we might add some extensions of the above technologies.
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p><strong>Chat Lines</strong> --- these are actually technologies for 
supplementing asynchronous messaging (like email and the Internet) with 
synchronous messaging where students and faculty are assembled at the same 
point in time from various parts of the world to have synchronized 
communications. Older technologies include teleconferencing and video 
conferencing. Newer technologies include text, audio, and video conferencing 
via computer networks.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Real and Psuedo Audio/Video</strong> --- these are huge innovations 
for ALN. Downloadings of large audio/video files can be very time consuming and 
require computer capacity to handle the storage. The user is put on hold while 
audio or video files are being downloaded. Real audio/video commences to 
playback immediately without having to wait, and psuedo audio/video commences 
when only a portion (e.g., 10%) of a file has been downloaded. Real audio makes 
it possible to have radio broadcasts around the clock over the Internet, and 
these broadcasts can come from any part of the world. Examples of real audio 
application in courses along with the use of other ALN tools can be found in 
the Power Point slides at
http://www.online.uillinois.edu/oakley/presentations/UIUC_ALS_Links.html </p>

<ul> 
<li>
<p><strong>Wireless Communications</strong> --- portable computers can now be 
turned into cellular telephones such that students can communicate with faculty 
and each other with the flick of an antenna on the side of the computer. Email 
sending and receiving devices are now being (experimentally) installed in wrist 
watches.&nbsp;&nbsp; A good web site for remote control technolgies is at
http://www.networkcomputing.com/909/909r2.html </p> </li> 
<li>
<p><strong>Speech Recognition Software</strong> --- new technologies in this 
area allow for digitization of &quot;normal&quot; speech. Conversion of normal 
conversations greatly facilitates storage, search, and random access retrieval 
of all or portions of such conversations.&nbsp; You can read more about speech 
recognition technologies at http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245glosf.htm#Speech1

want it read back.&nbsp; You can read more about audio conversion at

<li>
<p><strong>Interactive Graphics on the Networks</strong> --- this includes 
VRML allowing for 3-D images to be manipulated (resized, turned, scrolled, 
etc.) over the Internet. One of the best web sites for VRML is at the San Diego 
Super Computing Center athttp://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/ At this site, my favorite 
demonstration service is the mathematica surface modelling utilitiy at

<li><b>Studio Classrooms</b> --- these were pioneered by Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute's Jack Wilson at
http://www.rpi.edu/dept/science/www/Interactive_learning/classrooms.html Large 
lecture halls are replaced by &quot;studios&quot; where pairs or small groups 
of students learn interactively on computers. The emphasis is on asynchronous 
learning rather than synchronized presentations. More recent applications are 
summarized in &quot;Teaching on the Web and the Studio Classroom,&quot; 
Syllabus, April 1998, 37-39. The Syllabus web site is at http://www.

<p>Probably more important than the tools are the clever ways in ALN for using 
these tools and the possibility for abusing the tools. For an analysis of these

<p><b>MUD, MOO, and MUSH Extensions</b></p> 
<p>A somewhat bolder extension of ALN pedagogy entails having students create 
their own avatars and learning worlds. MUDs are Multi-User Dimensions or 
Multiple User Dungeon, or Multiple User Dialogue. These are extensions of 
Dungeons and Dragons that seduced &quot;adolescents&quot; into a network world 
of imaginary places. Now there are serious social and education MUDs. Some of 
the many types of MUDs and MUDding are reviewed
http://www.lysator.liu.se/mud/faq/faq1.html. </p> 
<p>There are extensions such as Object-Oriented MOO applications that, along 
with MUDs, have become serious educational experiments and applications. For 
example, inTechnological Horizons in Education THE<i> </i>(
http://www.thejournal.com), March 1997, pp. 66-68, the Director of Information 
Resources (Michael Conlon) at the University of Florida reports on the MOOville 
writing workshop for over 2,500 students per semester at the University of 
Florida. A summary of the article is provided by Jensen and Sandlin at
http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245ch02.htm#Advantages5. An example of the 
network learning features of MOOville is by Conlon as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>When an instructor assigned a short play for students to read, instead of 
discussing it by talking face to face with each other, each group of students 
would go to its workspace in MOOville and conduct their discussions online. 
Students were not allowed to address each other verbally. At their 
workstations, students had to type in their ideas for other group members to 
read and respond to; they also had to respond in return.</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The MOOville pedagogy has become exceedingly popular with University of 
Florida faculty and students. Dr. Conlon concludes the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>To those who say that a subject as complicated as writing cannot be taught 
with computers, we say that it definitely can, especially when the computer 
becomes the gateway to an environment that draws students in and excites them 
about expressing themselves through writing.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Another less extreme extension is the MUSH which, like a MUD, is an 
electronic space in which multiple persons (players, users, students) 
socialize, create &quot;worlds,&quot; and interact in gaming or serious 
episodes. For a discussion of the history and applications of MUSHes, see 
&quot;The Mush Manual&quot; by Lydia Leong at
http://galaxy.neca.com/~soruk/manual.html. The variations differ more in terms 
of underlying software codes than in purpose and application.</p>

<p><strong><b>Types of ALN Contracting</b></strong></p> 
<p>Costs of development of a virtual university are discussed by Murray 
Turhoff athttp://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/Papers/cbdevu.html The abstract reads as 
follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This paper is an update of one that the author published in 1982. It deals 
with the costs and effort required to set up a first class academic program for 
2000 students that is made up of students and faculty scattered around the 
world. The establishment of such a University would cost less than the addition 
of a single classroom building on a physical college campus (approximately $15 
million US).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There are of course many options as to scale and magnitude of effort.&nbsp; 
In terms of new courses at a university, the most expensive option is probably 
on-campus development of either a traditional or an ALN course internally. The 
alternative option is to contract for selected ALN courses from other 
developers (vendors). In some instances the price of importing a course may not 
be significant (e.g., when the course is developed using state funds with the 
proviso that other institutions in the state are to share in the results). In 
other instances, the price may be very high (e.g., where the vendor both 
develops and administers the ALN course).</p> 
<p>Bill Graves discusses various &quot;micro market&quot; scenarios in 
&quot;Adapting to the Emergence of Educational Micro Markets&quot; in the 
September/October 1997 issue ofEducom Review (pp. 26-31). Many universities 
will probably take on some form of the first scenario on Page 30 that reads as 
follows (emphasis added):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A traditional institution (college or university) can move selectively to 
offer online versions of existing courses and degree programs. This is already 
happening in many institutions in an ad hoc incremental manner that<b>adds 
value to the institution&#146;s core programs</b>.</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>For example, adding an array of ALN business technology courses would add 
value to our existing core programs in Business Administration at Trinity 
University. ALN courses bridge key gaps in the core program. The second 
scenario, according to Dr. Graves, is to become a &quot;meta&quot; university 
like the University of Utah that is retaining its traditional market niche

University. The third scenario is to become a &quot;mega&quot; university

<p><strong><b>The Myth of Lower Faculty Cost: Network Bridges May Be Cheap 
Shots or Very Costly to Deliver</b></strong></p> 
<p>I indicated above that my colleagues are skeptical about contracting for 
any networked ALN courses even though some courses would greatly improve the 
curriculum at Trinity University. Their skepticism, however, may be for the 
wrong reasons. Some early studies of ALN at other universities indicate that 
ALN is more effective than traditional pedagogy. However, skepticism regarding 
labor intensity and need for high faculty dedication to ALN are well grounded.
</p> 
<p>Networked courses are cheaper than traditional courses due to virtual 
elimination of needs for physical classrooms, building maintenance, and 
expensive on-site faculty. They can be virtually paperless and administered 
with little or no contact between faculty and students.<b>However, most 
respected universities are not considering the cheapest form of distributed 
education.</b> Duke University forged ahead with its new and very expensive 
Global Executive MBA (GEMBA) networked, prestigious, and high tuition program 
described athttp://www.fuqua.duke.edu/programs/gemba/index.htm.</p> 
<p>In the October 20, 1997 issue of <em>Business Week</em> article on GEMBA, 
the title of the article is &quot;THE HOTTEST CAMPUS ON THE INTERNET: Duke's 
pricey online B-school program is winning raves from students and rivals.&quot; 
By &quot;pricey&quot; the article means that the tuition alone is $82,500 for 
this online combination of synchronous and ALN modules. Although it may not be 
available for long on the web, at the time of this writing the<em>Business Week
</em> article is available free at</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>http://www.businessweek.com/1997/42/b3549015.htm </p> </blockquote> 
<p>The GEMBA Program at Duke University stresses increased rather than 
decreased communications between faculty and students and between students 
themselves via newer technologies for global online communication. Heavily 
featured in the GEMBA program are networked cases and chat lines between 
students who reside in virtually all parts of the globe. Component technologies 
used by GEMBA at present are as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Voice over network synchronous discussions </p> 
<p>Application-sharing software </p> 
<p>CD-ROM multimedia course ware </p> 
<p>E-mail </p> 
<p>Electronic bulletin boards </p> 
<p>Streaming audio </p> 
<p>Synchronous group discussion software </p> 
<p>World Wide Web browser </p> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<p>Another leading edge program is the Ohio University Online MBA Without 
Boundries program athttp://sirius.cba.ohiou.edu/www/intranet/#mbawb .&nbsp; My 
friend Thomas Calderon writes as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yesterday I visited Ohio University to take a look at their &quot;MBA 
Without Boundaries&quot; program. It was facinating. The program is offered on 
the web using Lotus Notes and Domino. It is a two-year, lock step program that 
is 100% project oriented. Students must complete a number of individual 
projects and about 8 major group projects. No text books are required or 
recommended. Six instructors team teach the program and they collaborate on 
every project. The entire program is a collaborative effort between students 
and faculty that is supported by a powerful web-enabled GDSS tool. The program 
is very selective and students pay a hefty fee.</p> 
<p>By the way, thanks again for your contribution to Ohio AAA.</p>

<p>Some of the top universities experimenting with network delivery of courses 
are finding that networking can be a victim of its own success. This is the 
purported experience of the ALN experiments in the College of Commerce and 
Business Administration at the University of Illinois under a relatively large 
grant from the Sloan Foundation.<b>The unexpected huge cost arises from labor 
intensity of dealing with increased messaging of students in networked courses 
and the varying ALN styles needed for differing types of students.</b>In the 
Sloan Foundation funded ALN courses, it was discovered that students normally 
reluctant to communicate in traditional classrooms and faculty offices suddenly 
want to write vast amounts in writing assignments and other messages in the 
Illinois ALN experimental courses. Teaching assistants had to be hired to 
assist faculty in dealing with the huge and somewhat unexpected volume of 
student messaging. It was also found that different types of students (Eager 
Beavers versus Drones versus Sluggos) need different types of ALN pedagogy.</p> 
<p>The &quot;urge to message&quot; phenomenon among students will come as no 
surprise to major corporations such as Wal-Mart, Microsoft, and most other 
corporations that have very fine web sites but cannot afford the labor expenses 
of personally responding to email messages from customers and the public at 
large. Some companies like Wal-Mart for a short time encouraged their web site 
users to send in messages and, soon thereafter, drowned in a sea of messages. 
To stem the flood, typical options currently available at most corporate web 
sites are only to fill out standardized forms (that computers can process) 
and/or to limit email messaging to webmasters with suggestions for improving 
the web site. Although Dell Corporation has over $2 million in sales per day 
from web site order forms, a message sent to the only email address provided at 
the Dell web site reads as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Please note, the webmaster@dell.com address is for communications regarding 
this website only. While all messages are read, we may not respond to or 
forward your message.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Note that corporations can limit 800-number phone messaging by simply 
setting the capacity for incoming telephone calls such that, when all lines are 
busy, the public must wait for an open phone line. Email messaging cannot be 
controlled with &quot;busy signals.&quot; As a result, corporations either do 
not provide any email addresses at their web sites or they restrict the types 
of messages that will be answered. Some large and small business organizations 
have delayed extending 800-number type services to web services due to the 
anticipation of being swamped with use of the web services and the added 
messaging that will accompany the web services. Email addresses, unlike 
telephone numbers, of departments and divisions of major corporations are 
closely guarded secrets. Customers, students, and network users in general 
appear to &quot;love to message&quot; according to early experiments in web 
site administrators. FedEx is one of the rare exceptions to offer to personally 
respond to public messaging athttp://www.fedex.com/email-form.html. Labor costs 
are enormous for having humans read and respond to email messages.</p> 
<p>There are added costs that are noted in some of the grant reports filed 
with the Sloan Foundation. In particular, the Final Report from Stanford 
University is negative about current technologies for ALN courses and calls 
cost problems &quot;problematic.&quot;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The problem of cost is problematic. As mentioned above, there is an 
expectation that asynchronously delivered courses will be less costly than 
synchronously delivered ones. To some extent this is a simple pricing issue. 
However, if we frame the issue as the need for the production, maintenance, and 
delivery costs of an asynchronous course to be less than that of either a live 
or televised class, we can make some observations. Our experience shows that 
the production and delivery costs of adequate quality multimedia content are 
high. In a situation such as that at Stanford, where classes are taught live 
and are also televised, asynchronous delivery is a direct cost overlay. 
Although live classes will continue into the foreseeable future, on-line 
synchronous delivery could supplant television should the quality of the two 
methods become comparable.</p>

94-12-7, March 4, 1997http://pocari.stanford.edu/history/index.html</p> 
</blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>It should be noted that newer technology is now being installed at Stanford 
University that will improve upon both ALN and traditional courses. At the 
moment, Microsoft Corporation is leading the way in installing technologies at 
Stanford University that will put every Business Administration course on a 
network server. Even though Stanford has not yet announced plans to make these 
courses available to other campuses through its Stanford Online Program, it 
will not take much effort to do so when competition from other prestige 
universities makes it popular to join in the movement toward global networking 
of courses and/or entire degree programs.</p> 
<p>Microsoft Corporation provides a recent online article by Dees Stallings 
entitled &quot;Applying Taylor's Efficiencies in cyberspace.&quot; This article 
describes some ways to improve efficiencies of asynchronous courses. The

<p><strong><b>How to Reduce Messaging Costs in ALN Courses</b></strong></p> 
<p>The &quot;cheap shot&quot; way to reduce messaging costs is to virtually do 
away with messaging to course administrators by limiting messaging to only 
technical support in making the online or CD-ROM course work on a given 
computer. Most respected universities are understandably reluctant to take the 
cheap shot approach. Faculty themselves must be dedicated to a long-term ALN 
pedagogy. Several faculty at Drexel University who participated in a Sloan ALN 
grant warn that:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Institutions as a whole must also be committed to ALN-based education and 
training. If organizations regard the technology as a fad or as something in 
which they must become involved because of perceived competition, then they 
will not sustain ALNs as part of the primary delivery processes. The danger 
today is that asynchronous learning-along with other forms of &quot;distance 
education&quot;-will remain in the labs and in the hands of 
techno-educators-who seldom represent mainstream faculty interests.</p> 
<p>Asynchronous Learning Networks: Drexel's Experience 
http://www.thejournal.com/past/oct/510andriole.html</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>A more respected way to lower messaging costs is to investigate why 
students need to have such frequent messaging with the course instructor or 
teaching assistants. Chances are that many of the messages arise because of 
deficiencies in the provided ALN materials. The deficiencies may be in terms of 
content or in terms of poor aids in navigating that content. In this regard, I 
have provided a checklist of things to consider when designing ALN learning 
materials. This checklist is available at
http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/ideasmm.htm. Good design will not eliminate 
messaging, but great designs might eliminate an enormous proportion of the 
messages. One problem that experimenters with ALN are having is that budgets 
and material preparation time are inadequate for creating great ALN content 
with creative navigation aids.</p> 
<p>Another way to reduce messaging costs is to invest more heavily in 
developing &quot;intelligent&quot; ALN materials versus &quot;one size fits 
all&quot; materials. In U.S. Department of Defense courses, the distinction 
lies in computer based training (CBT) versus intelligent computer based 
training (ICBT). When the military develops ICBT, the material contains 
artificial intelligence utilities that adapt to the background, aptitude, and 
motivation of the learner. It was mentioned above that after experimenting with 
ALN courses at the University of Illinois, Professor Arvan discusses ALN in 
terms of students classified as &quot;Eager Beavers&quot; versus 
&quot;Drones&quot; versus &quot;Sluggos.&quot; Virtually all universities 
contend that the majority of their students are Eager Beavers rather than 
Drones and Sluggos. Professor Arvan concludes that the proportion of actual 
Eager Beavers may be overstated and, in their cases, the need for labor 
intensive discourse is different but nevertheless significant:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I'd be remiss if I didn't say something about ALN and Eager Beavers before 
concluding. Though I believe there can be substantial benefit from utilizing 
ALN in a course primarily composed of Eager Beavers, that use should be 
substantially different from what I have outlined above, because the teaching 
objective is different. The main goal in the case of Eager Beavers is to 
promote high-quality discourse, rather than to offer a channel for getting help 
and to provide an incentive for doing the work.</p> 
<p>From Lanny Arvan in the Department of Economics at <strong>
http://www.cba.uiuc.edu/~larvan/ALNessays/ALN1.html</strong></p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>If the ALN materials contained artificial intelligence that identified the 
type of learner, it might be possible to reduce messaging costs by 
automatically varying the navigation options to learning styles and aptitudes. 
This will not eliminate discourse and other messaging costs, but it may take 
some of the drudgery out of messaging.</p>

<p><strong><b>Components of ALN</b></strong></p> 
<p>Jack Wilson at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has had a great deal of 
experience in an ALN program at Rennsselaer. He states that a &quot;good&quot; 
ALN will have the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Delivery on standards-based multimedia PCs equipped for live video/audio 
interactions and connected to a robust IP multicasting network</li> 
<li>A mix of synchronous and asynchronous activity</li> 
<li>Use of Intranet and/or CD-ROM-based multimedia materials</li> 
<li>Live audio and/or video interactions among the students and with faculty
</li> 
<li>Use of professional quality software tools for CAD, symbolic math, 
spreadsheets, word processing, etc.</li> 
<li>Small group discussions</li> 
<li>Question-and-answer tools to verify content retention</li> 
<li>Collaborative software for application sharing and application synching 
over the network</li> 
<li>Access to rich resources on the network</li> 
<li>Floor control to allow classroom coordination for both instructor-led and 
student-centered learning</li> 
<li>Course administration to track student progress and to identify the 
students during the synchronous interactions</li> </ul>

<p>Small group discussions can be carried on in chat lines or some type of 
email setup such as a listserv. Professor Wilson also argues that good ALN 
courses will still have both instructor-led and student-led learning in 
addition to pre-recorded ALN learning materials.</p>

<p><strong>Components of SLN</strong></p> 
<p>Online courses need not be ALN. &nbsp; Indeed many of them are mainly 
synchronous learning network (SLN) courses with small amounts of asynchronous 
ALN material.&nbsp; Most SLN courses in the past and present are taught with 
interactive television.&nbsp; A few courses are now SLN via the Internet. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p>A highlight for me at the November 6-7, 1998 AICPA Accounting Educators 
Conference was a presentation by Sharon Lightner from San Diego State 
University and Linard Nadig from Switzerland. This presentation followed a 
ceremony presenting Professors Lightner and Nadig with the $1,000 AICPA 
Collaboration Award prize. The Collaboration Award was given for an online 
course that is now offered to a class comprised of five students from each of 
six universities in the United States, Japan, Switzerland, Spain, and Hong 
Kong. I videotaped the presentation by Professor Lightner and Nadig and will 
now share my summary of the highlights of this innovative international 
accounting course. The summary highlights and links can be found at</p> 
<p>http://WWW.Trinity.edu/~rjensen/255light.htm </p> 
<p>The course has some highly innovative features including the online 
participation of accounting standard setting bodies in the various countries 
mentioned above. The course is also innovative in that students in class and in 
team projects see and hear one another over the Internet in a manner much like 
they would see and hear each other if they were all in the same classroom. The 
course has one instructor from each of the campuses.</p> 
<p>The components of a SLN course include servers, cameras attached to each 
client compujter, real audio software, real video software, and software for 
chat lines, file transfers, etc.&nbsp; An example of software components and a 
discussion of possible problems is given at
http://WWW.Trinity.edu/~rjensen/255light.htm#TechnologySoftware </p> 
<p>A good example of an entire online degree program that is heavily a SLN 
program is the Duke University Global Executive MBA (GEMBA) program described at

<p><strong>Will Higher Education Adopt Business Strategies?</strong></p> 
<p>In <em>On the Horizon</em>, July/August 1997, D.P. Snyder lists the 
following business strategies that loom on the horizon for higher education 
following the lead of postindustrial enterprises:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Insourcing and outsourcing</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Collaborative in-house initiatives and teamwork</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Intrapreneurship and extrapreneurship</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Distribution channeling</p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>He suggests that these will be translated to the following education 
strategies:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Modular core curriculum packaging</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Licensing certified franchising</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Distributed teams</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Distance learning</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Virtual classroms</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Collegial colloborations</p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Colleges and universities have been slow to adopt business strategies that 
are fueling the postindustrial revolution. &nbsp; One reason is that 
educational institutions have thrived on regional monopolies and/or the halo of 
hallowed tradition.&nbsp; In the 21st Century, however, networking technologies 
will gnaw away at traditional comparative advantages.&nbsp; As competition for 
students becomes more intense, colleges and universities will experiment more 
and more with business strategies of the late 20th Century.</p>

<p><strong>ALN vs Self-Directed Learning (SDL)</strong></p> 
<p>ALN and self-directed learning (SDL) had different origins. SDL is an older 
term that evolved from continuing (adult) education, correspondence courses, 
and corporate training. SDL existed before computer networking whereas ALN 
implicitly assumes computer networking and/or CD-ROM<strong>hypertext </strong>
and<strong>hypermedia</strong>. However, SDL applications have moved quickly to 
computer networks and CD-ROMs with hypertext and hypermedia. Few, if any, 
differences remain between SDL and ALN.</p> 
<p>One difference of note is that SDL usually depicts a self-paced learner 
struggling alone with the learning materials and occasional messaging with a 
trainer or instructor. ALN typically makes use of more recent collaborative 
technologies of<strong>chat lines</strong>, <strong>listservs</strong>, and 
<strong>webcasting</strong>. In addition, ALN in a college setting is rarely 
totally asynchronous. Usually there are synchronous elements that possibly 
include classroom lectures and case discussions.</p> 
<p>SDL has become a &quot;quiet revolution&quot; in corporate training 
according to Guglielmino and Murdick:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There has been a &quot;quiet revolution&quot; going on in the training 
departments of some of corporate America's most prestigious companies. For 
example, a series of national seminars were conducted by the International 
Quality &amp; Productivity Center on Self-Directed Learning during the past 
three years. Companies such as Motorola, Disney, Aetna, Xerox, U.S. West, Levi 
Strauss, Owens-Corning, and American Airlines have all been implementing SDL in 
their long-term training and development strategies. These companies have 
discovered an educational practice that has its roots in the Socratic method. 
It is called<em>self-directed learning</em>. Organizational and technological 
changes have forced companies to re-examine the way employees learn and what 
they learn.</p> 
<p>The storage time of an individual's knowledge from acquisition to use has 
shrunk because employees must use the latest knowledge available to keep 
companies at the edge of the competition. In essence, we have entered the age 
of &quot;just-in-time learning.&quot; This type of learning has been discovered 
to be self-directed learning. It is the only approach possible for keeping 
learning in sync with the rapidly changing environment. The nature and 
advantages of this method of learning as well as successful applications will 
be presented in the following sections.</p> 
<p>P.J. Guglielmino and R.G. Murdick<br>
 &quot;Sel-Directed Learning: The 
Quiet Revolution<br>
<em>SAM Advanced Management Journal</em><br>
 Summer 1997, 
p. 10</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Comparisons of SDL with traditional training is always risky. <strong>
Hawthorne effects</strong> become major problems in experimental designs. These 
are distortions and possibly non-sustaining effects of a treatment just because 
its newness captures more of an individual's attentiveness. In double blind 
studies of the impact of technologies upon learning, Hawthorne effects are 
particularly troublesome. Students are apt to be more attentive to newer 
technologies simply because they are &quot;new&quot; curiosities. Positive 
results on learning impacts may not be sustaining, however, after the novelty 
and curiosity factors decline with repeated use of the technology over time.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, there are repeated reports of successes of SDL in both 
reduced cost and improved performance in training. An example is provided in a 
Motorola Corporation plant as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In 1994, 633 associates undertook 853 self-study courses. This represented 
over 3,000 hours of SDL training in just four months. In 1995, 1,920 learning 
plans were completed, resulting in 4,080 self-study hours, or 40% of the total 
course offerings. Approximately 50% of the associates selected a self-study 
course to learn what they needed.<em>The average cost per hour for delivering 
the traditional classroom instruction was $13.34, while the average for 
delivering the self-directed material was $7.76.</em>It is interesting to note 
that the results of the learning indicate the self-direct approach proved as 
good as, or better than, the traditional learning method. Recently, Motorola 
Paging Division has made a commitment to extend this SDL approach to all of its 
sites worldwide.</p>

<p>This type of SDL was not undertaken with the instruction labor intensity of 
the ALN experiments on university campuses under Sloan Foundation grants. Cost 
savings may not be as dramatic in ALN. Also, without instructional labor 
intensity, SDL may not be as effective with college students as it is with 
highly motivated adult employees seeking promotions and job performance 
evaluations.</p>

<p><strong><b>A Comment Regarding Intranet versus Internet Courses</b></strong>
</p> 
<p>Before closing this document, I would like to make a comment about Internet 
courses. An &quot;Internet&quot; course is any course that makes use of the 
Internet (usually by means of http protocols on the World Wide Web). The 
transmitted materials may be selected materials or entire courses.</p> 
<p>An &quot;intranet&quot; is any network that has some type of restricted 
access to materials (web pages, images, audio files, video files, animation 
files, databases, etc) on the Internet. The common access restriction is a 
password that in the case of online course materials must be purchased. One 
type of intranet is formed when a textbook publisher restricts access to only 
users who have paid for the right to open an online textbook. For example, see 
textbook listing at Cybertext Publishing (<strong>http://www.cybertext.com/
</strong>). The University of Pheonix uses similar intranets for course 
material access at<strong>http://www.uophx.edu/online/</strong>. An example of 
a student's experience at taking an online course is provided byCyberSchool at 
<strong>http://CyberSchool.4j.lane.edu/About/CSClass/CSClass.html.</strong></p> 
<p>In many instances, course materials used by faculty are shared freely with 
the world without intranet restrictions. Example links to free shareware are 
shown below:</p>

</blockquote> 
<p>Once again it is stressed that ALN courses my have online learning 
materials that make a course heavily asynchronous, but the &quot;complete&quot; 
course will most likely be improved with some synchronous components such as 
traditional classroom meetings, distance learning &quot;classrooms&quot; such 
as with interactive TV connections, audio conferencing, video conferening, chat 
lines, etc.</p> 
<p>Judith Boettcher describes the range of &quot;Web-light&quot; to &quot;Web 
courses&quot; possibilities as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I think it is useful to describe some of the characteristics for courses 
using these new technologies. It is also useful, I think, not to think in terms 
of either-or but to think in terms of online/Web courses/Internet courses as 
points on a continuum. Some of the courses might be described, for example, as 
&quot;Web-light,&quot; while other courses are truly &quot;Web courses&quot; in 
that they are delivered fully on the Web and are accessible anytime and 
anywhere.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About the Explosion of ALN in Education</b></strong></p>
<p><strong><b>Concerns About Residency Living &amp; Learning on Campus</b>
</strong></p> 
<p>I recently listened to an address by Robert S. Sullivan, Directory of the IC
2 Institute, University of Texas at Austin. He was extremely positive about 
opportunities for ALN networking and bridging of curriculum gaps with web 
courses that in many instances will become much higher in quality than a single 
university will normally be able to develop only for its own campus. At the end 
of his address, in response to a question from the audience, he did raise two 
very serious concerns (that I paraphrased below from my videotape of his 
remarks):</p> 
<blockquote>

<p><b><strong>Concerns About Impersonality and Becoming</strong></b> <strong>
IrrevocablyOrwellian </strong></p> 
<p>One of my students, Elizabeth Eudy, coined the phrase &quot;irrevocably 
Orwellian.&quot;&nbsp; Athttp://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/eeudy/aln.htm she 
writes the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Although it is too far fetched to say that we will turn into cold, 
heartless robots as a result of ALN and that our society has become irrevocably 
Orwellian, the lack of face-to-face social interaction could potentially do 
more harm than good in our education. Will graduates of ALN degree programs be 
left wondering how they will cope in an actual job interview? Students need 
social interaction as vital component sof maturation and professional 
development. The most successful use of ALN thus presents itself as a 
combination of online courses and real classroom interaction. The classes do 
not necessarily have to meet twice or three times a weeks as most do now, but 
rather as needed by the demands of students or by the judgement of the 
professor. In any case, as the market for ALN courses expands (as it is doing) 
traditional universities will have to upgrade their curriculum to ALN in order 
to remain competitive.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>At a later point she writes the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>ALN courses can be dehumanized to such an extent that students will no 
longer feel as if they belong to a learning community. Community is a key 
concept for the learning process, and enables students to gain support from 
each other. This concept is taken to the limit in traditional universities 
where students belong to a university community--they live in the dorms, they 
eat together at the cafeteria, they join various student organizatons, and most 
importantly, they learn together. The professors and students ideally belong to 
the same community of learning; although in some universities students feel 
that professors are too inaccessible. Many proponents of ALN still agree that 
the human component of education and university life is necessary. Degerhan 
Usleul, the chief operating officer of Interactive Learning International 
Corporation (ILINC), is quoted as saying:<em> The importance of an instructor's 
physical presence, complete with body language, as well as the rapport one 
builds with classmates, are not easily replaced</em>. Jo Ann Davy continues in 
the article, writing that<em> Usluel</em> recommends holding a physical event 
to help relationships, before connecting online.<br>

<p>Another student named Katie Lawrence lists drawbacks of ALN as follows at 
http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~alawrenc/ALN.html </p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>There are more dropouts than in actual on-campus courses </li> 
<li>Loss of commuinty/campus atmosphere </li> 
<li>There are no current standards for program assessment, so it is difficult 
for students to know which courses will be worth the money they are spending
</li> 
<li>Often, the high fees charged for some ALN courses go to fund actual campus 
courses rather than the virtual courses being offered.</li> 
<li>Due to the large number of students taking ALN courses and their tendency 
to contact professors frequently, more professors or teaching assistants are 
required to adequately teach a cyber course.</li> 
<li>&quot;Learning ceases to be about analysis, discussion, and examination, 
and becomes a product to be bought and sold, to be packaged, advertised, and 
marketed.&quot; (taken from<strong>Dangers of Global Education</strong>) </li> 
<li>Students loose out by not actually reading published books. </li> 
<li>Because the courses are developed in the Western world, Western views are 
spread to all parts of the globe, which may inhibit the cultural growth of 
other societies, thus creating a unified, undiverse world. Computer access and 
availability and modem speed are problems for ALN courses given on college 
campuses - students are often times unable to log on due to slow modems or busy 
network lines.</li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>Barbara Brown discusses the myth of asynchronous learning impersonality:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Another myth one frequently encounters about computer-mediated instruction 
is that of impersonality. People assume that in the absence of face-to-face 
interaction, relations automatically become more distant and impersonal. 
Traditional distance learning formats are said to be plagued with this 
problem.[9] Not so, in my experience with the interactive digital classroom. 
There is a type of intimacy achievable between teachers and students in this 
medium that is quite extraordinary, reminiscent of what Sproull and Keisler 
refer to as &quot;second-level&quot; social effects of the technology. I 
believe this intimacy results from a sense of shared control and esponsibility, 
commitment to collaboration and dialogue, and increased willingness to take 
risks in communications with others nline. The verbal and writing-intensive 
nature of the text-based forum network also forces one to make one&#146;s 
thoughts very explicit whenever possible; there is little room for subtlety. As 
one administrator put it: &quot;In an online environment, words matter.... 
Words are everything.&quot;</p> 
<p>Also, it takes longer for groups to reach consensus in brain-storming and 
problem-solving situations online.[10] People&#146;s feelings can be hurt 
easily, so more time and effort are put into explaining meanings and supplying 
detailed contextual background to enhance mutual understanding. Thus, writers 
get to know one another intimately over time while computer-mediated 
conversations - both formal and informal - unfold. Neither e-mail nor chat, the 
forum classroom environment at Fielding calls for and inspires thoughtful, 
composed (after reading and reflection) asynchronous networked interactions, 
without sacrificing human warmth.</p> 
<p>At this stage in the evolution of Internet educational technology, we are 
all learners. There is also a sense that we are innovators and early adopters 
who &quot;crossed over&quot; early in the technology transfer and diffusion 
process.[11] In the Fielding culture, this pioneer experience has come to be 
known as riding the waves, or embracing the &quot;turbulence&quot; of rough 
seas - a metaphor for global and organizational unrest as well. The attention 
given to group process online and the thoughtful nature of master&#146;s-level 
conversations establish an intimacy within the group, belying the myth of 
impersonality.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns About Making Education and Training Too Easy</strong></p> 
<p>It has been demonstrated in various ways in cognitive and learning science 
that making a training environment easier may be dysfunctional in the sense 
that it improves short term memory at the expense of long-term memory and 
performance. &nbsp; Complex information needs to be multiply encoded in 
semantic and/or situational associations.&nbsp; Computer-aided training may 
either enhance or detract from long-term performance.</p> 
<p>For example, I am inclined to make it easier for students to find answers 
or get leads each course topic.&nbsp; I view it as taking the Mickey Mouse 
drudgeries of finding things that consume time.I hope to provide my students 
with more time to study what they find and less time trying to find what they 
study.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do so I provide as much literature as possible on CD-ROMs 
(many of which I record myself), my LAN hard drive, and the University's web 
server.&nbsp; However, it is possible that the Mickey Mouse activities 
contribute significantly to long-term memory.&nbsp; To the extent that I am 
making discovery less difficult and more predictable, I might in fact be 
improving students' short term performance at the expense of long-term memory 
and cognition.</p> 
<p>Robert Bjork states:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It has now been demonstrated in a variety of ways, and with a variety of 
motor, verbal, and problem-solving tasks, that introducing variation and/or 
unpredictability in the training environment causes difficulty for the learner 
but enhances long-term performance --- particularly the ability to transfer 
training to novel but related task environments.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns About Making Education and Training Too Hard </strong></p> 
</blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>All courses at Trinity University are three-credit courses.&nbsp; Virtually 
all of my students are full-time students who are taking at least five courses 
each semester.&nbsp; On the faculty evaluation forms one of the questions 
reads:&nbsp; &quot;How would you rate the workload of this course?&quot; &nbsp; 
Another question reads:&nbsp; &quot;How difficult did you find this 
course?&quot; &nbsp; As I added more ALN modules in place of lectures, answers 
to these questions virtually all moved to &quot;Very Heavy&quot; and &quot;Very 
Difficult.&quot;&nbsp; The following quotation is representative of class 
concerns:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The work load was very heavy and put a strain on my other classes.&nbsp; I 
liked the material, but weekly quizzes and examinations plus 50-90 pages of 
reading per class along with other classes is too much.</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Actually I usually do not assign pages to read, but in the process of 
studying assigned topics, my graduate students dig out a huge &nbsp; amount of 
material that they themselves feel they must study.&nbsp; In research projects 
constituting over 50% of the course grade, they must seek out, sift, digest, 
and nurture a vast amount of learning material.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often students must 
spend a great deal of time building foundations to even study the 
material.&nbsp; For example, projects entailing both design and implementation 
of relational datatbases entail learning how to make complicated software 
work.&nbsp; Projects entailing how to account for financial instruments 
derivatives entail learning what those financing contracts are and how they are 
used in hedging stragegies.</p> 
<p>The bottom line is that it is would not be reasonable for all five graduate 
courses each semester to take as much time as my courses. &nbsp; Students would 
become frustrated, angered, and seek to somehow short circuit their effort if 
there was not enough time each week to cover five similar ALN courses. &nbsp; 
Their traditional lecture courses are often neat and tidy with problems 
assigned from the back of the textbook and sufficient material in the textbook 
or lectures to master the assigned materials.&nbsp; Students all study the same 
materials and can help each other in many lecture courses.&nbsp; In my 
asynchronous modules, students must do a lot more digging on their own and 
generally come away frustrated by the &quot;loose ends&quot; that they neither 
have the time nor skills to master nor the skills to master. &nbsp; For 
example, in the process of studying risk exposures of derivatives contracts 
they encounter mathematically complexValue at Risk time series 
models.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few of the mathematically inclined students who elect to 
delve into such models learn more about Value at Risk&nbsp; than students who 
go down other avenues on their projects.&nbsp; Hence, students are not all 
studying the same materials, and it becomes more difficult to lean on each 
other for help crossing troubled waters.&nbsp; In many instances their 
instructor, me, is not sufficiently up on the particulars of each topic to bail 
them out.&nbsp; For more on this, skip to the section entitled<strong>Fostering 
Deeper Learning: &nbsp; Risks of Teaching More Than You Know.</strong></p> 
<p>I like to force students to struggle on their own, because I think this 
prepares them for life after graduation.&nbsp; However, there is a fine line in 
ALN between making ALNtoo easy versus making ALN too hard. I have not yet 
achieved the correct balance.&nbsp; One example where asynchronous learning 
appears to achieve a good balance is the Business Activity Model (BAM) in 
Intermediate Accounting at theMcIntire School of Commerce at the University of 
Virginia.&nbsp; A portion of one of my recent email messages is quoted below:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The mere fact that many ALN courses are shown to improve grades and/or the 
rate at which learning takes place does not imply that long-term performance 
has been enhanced. It is not clear whether better performance arises from a 
confounding of added sweat with ALNs. What does intrigue me, however, is how an 
entire year of Intermediate Accounting (typically very tough courses requiring 
memorization of lots of accounting rules and procedures) is now being taught at 
the University of Virginia totally without lectures by the two professors (
<strong>Croll</strong> and <strong>Catanach</strong>) who, up until 1996, 
lectured (quite brilliantly) in virtually every class. Their anecdotal claims 
for the &quot;BAM&quot; non-lecture approach are that students are doing 
markedly better on in course examinations, the CPA examination, and on the job 
(which they can monitor since all students have internships with firms). I now 
feature a multimedia workshop module of the University of Virginia BAM ALN 
program. The average SAT of students in these UVA classes is over 1300. It is 
not clear that BAM will work so well on lesser mortals.</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>One way to judge good ALN workload balance is to keep track of teaching 
evaluations.&nbsp; Students generally voice complaints when workloads are 
unreasonable (they will not always complain when a course is too easy). &nbsp; 
The BAM asynchronous courses at the University of Virginia have heavy 
workloads, but Professors Croll and Catanach manage to pull these courses off 
with some of the highest instructor evaluations in the McIntire School of 
Commerce.</p>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Corporate Influences on Traditional Missions</b>
</strong></p> 
<p>There are two types of partnerings between business firms and 
universities.&nbsp; The first type is where the university's faculty deliver a 
specialized degree program to employess of a business firm.&nbsp; The program 
is often specialized calendar, courses, and mode of delivery.&nbsp; For 
example, the PriceWaterhouse Coopers MBA program at the University of Georgia 
has a customized calendar, customized courses, and all courses are delivered 
asynchronously on the web. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another type of partnering is where the business firms deliver courses for 
the university degree programs.&nbsp; An example of this type of partnering is 
the AT&amp;T partnering withWestern Governors University that was announced in 
two magazines that I track regularly. &nbsp; For example, see</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;AT&amp;T Learning Network Hosts WGU Content,&quot; T.H.E. Journal, 
February 1999, 14-16.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>One of my undergraduate students, Paul Meekey, notes the rise of 
partnerships between universities and corporations where the universities 
participate in educating and training employees of companies.&nbsp; Paul's 
paper can be found athttp://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/pmeekey/frame2.htm 
wherein he states the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Employers are always trying to find ways to cut costs and now with the 
introduction of ALN,<br>
 they should be able to do so. Two companies that have 
enabled this technology are helping to reduce costs in their post graduate 
business training programs.CIGNA Corporation, an <br>
 insurance company 
located in Philadelphia has formed a partnership withDrexell University, also 
in Philadelphia to create a master's program for information systems. They came 
up with a three year program that would train their students online. The only 
time they actually met offline was for a two day orientation at the Drexell 
campus and after that&nbsp; it was totally online. After the success of the 
program,Metlife, another insurancecompany decided to form a similar partnership 
with Drexel University. One advantage to this program that both company enjoyed 
was that both companies didn't have to give up their employees to go back to a 
university campus for the 2 yr. graduate program.<br>
<br>
The employees could 
remain working for the company, continue working on their projects and fulfill 
their educational requirements after work, before work, on their days off, or 
on the weekends. Richard H. Lytle, dean ofDrexel's College of Information and 
Technology, says that the he is really excited that both companies are not only 
using his program but applying it to software application within their own 
applications of everyday work. The program helps the companies to eliminate the 
some costs and uncertainties of trying to hire full-qualified employees from 
major universities and also the time lost when employees have to go to these 
classes during normal working hours. The companies are also using what they 
have learned throughDrexel University to eventually have all training in the 
company done through ALN, in all departments.New York University's School of 
Continuing Education also participates in online learning, and just recently 
formed a partnership with IBM to offer information systems courses for their 
professionals, on a global scale. We are sure to see a huge increase in ALN 
used in the business environment. Companies can keep their employees working 
hard and earning the profits while training them to make them more efficient at 
their job. Although still young, ALN is helping companies such asCiticorp, 
NYNEX Corp., and Sandoz to become more cost efficient in training their 
employees.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The above trends are a mixed blessing. &nbsp; Clearly, expansion into 
corporate education and training expands the market alternatives for colleges 
facing a shrinking and increasingly competitive environment for traditional 
students and traditional continuing education students.&nbsp; The flip side of 
the coin is that the universities may sacrifice some of their independence in 
setting curricula and course contents since corporations paying for the 
education and training will dictate such matters to a large degree.</p>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Library Services</b></strong></p> 
<p>The Internet has become the world's&nbsp; library. &nbsp; However, content 
pales in comparison with scholarly works found in libraries that contain vast 
resources that either are not or cannot be digitized.&nbsp; Making centuries of 
literature available on networks is cost prohibitive to digitize for and 
deliver from web servers.&nbsp; Copyright restrictions deliberately protect 
vast bodies of new and older literature from being digitized.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When asynchrounous courses are delivered off campus, library access becomes 
a major problem that is frequently ignored in the hype of ALN promotion.&nbsp; 
One of my students, Katie Greene, addresses this problem at
http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/kgreene/distanceno.htm</p> 
<p>In the above document, Katie provides links and references to literature on 
looming issues and &quot;new roles for librarians.&quot;&nbsp; She states:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><br>
Librarians must change their role if they want to keep up with the 
changes in education. They will need to change in three different ways. The 
first way would be that &quot;librarians will take on a more proactive role in 
the classroom and will work more collaboratively with the teaching faculty to 
develop assignments that are feasible in the off-campus/ distance 
environment.&quot; (Lebowitz) Secondly, distance education will bring about 
&quot;greater collaboration among institutions&quot;. (Lebowitz) Because their 
are no constraints on location, libraries from all over can work together to 
create collections of works and pool their resources. A good example of this 
cooperation, is Western Governors University, which is a university made by the 
governors of the western states. Along with this cooperation, though, &quot;the 
supplying of library services will become highly competitive, and libraries may 
choose to outsource the provision of services to other institutions&quot; 
(Cavanagh). Thirdly, the librarian's role &quot;will shift to one of 
facilitator/instructor, rather than provider of information.&quot; (Slade) 
Librarians will now be communicating with students in remote locations via 
e-mail, video conferencing, chat lines, or audio conferencing. One example of 
this is at<strong>University of Maryland University College</strong> where 
students can &quot;chat&quot; with librarians online and ask any questions they 
might have. Librarians will have to be proactive and learn about the new 
technologies and make the materials available to students all over the world.
<br> <br>
 Many have already used these devices and made the information 
available. Old ways included loan programs and mailing books and other 
materials. Now librarians use information technology to develop online, virtual 
libraries. One criticism is that distant students do not have access to as much 
information, but librarians are now able to put entire works, full texts of 
books, journals, references, newspapers, as well as web searches and internet 
access on the internet.</p> 
<p>Some Examples include:<br>
<br>
<strong>VIVA the virtual library of Virginia
</strong> - electronic collections of books, journals, newspapers , as well as 
internet searches.<br>
<br>
<strong>Online Literature Library</strong><br>
<br>

<strong>Internet Public Library</strong>- references, magazines, newspapers, 
online texts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Carrie-Full-Text Electronic Library</strong>. 
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Katie Greene raises other concerns and discusses the challenges of giving 
distance learners the same access to libraries as the access available to 
resident students.&nbsp; One wonders how top programs such as the Duke 
University Global Executive MBA program and the Ohio University Online MBA 
Without Boundries program&nbsp; manage to provide library resources to students.

Digital Library:&nbsp; What Happens When the Virtural Student Needs to Use the

the text of all books and journals in a major academic library due to copyright 
and impracticalities of digitizing trillions of pages of text and graphics, 
there are some collaborative efforts being made by various universities to aid 
students taking virutal courses off campus. &nbsp; At the time a am writing

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Academic Standards and Student Ethics</b></strong>
</p> 
<p>One of my students, Sophia Mena, at 
http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/smena/learning.htm wrote the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The first thing that came to mind when I first started researching the 
Virtual Classroom is how professors monitor if students are doing their own 
work. In the Traditional Classroom a professor can easily detect if a person is 
cheating on their test, but how can they monitor that if someone is taking a 
test by way of a computer?&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems very easy for someone to cheat 
in an asynchronous learning environment. To find out more about computer ethics 
you can visit:<br>
<br>
 Computer Ethics - Cyberethics:<br>

http://www.siu.edu/departments/coba/mgmt/iswnet/isethics/index.htm<br>
<br>
 
IEEE Code of Ethics: http://www.ieee.org/committee/ethics<br>
</p> </blockquote>
<p>In the 1900s it was common for students to take tests in the presence of 
the village vicar who then certified that all conditions placed upon taking an 
examination were followed.&nbsp; Some conditions are easily met with existing 
technologies such as timing the examination and webcams and microphones that 
allow the examiners to view and hear the student from most any distance around 
the world. &nbsp; Newer technologies such as retinal scanners are emerging to 
verifiy that the student taking the examination is truly the student who is 
authorized to take the examination.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, there are enormous problems with ethics and academic 
standards in ALN.&nbsp; For example, monitoring students on chat lines becomes 
expensive and intrusive.&nbsp; Most ALN courses assume that the email messages 
and chat line messages from a student are genuine without monitoring those 
messages with the same scrutiny that is given to course examinations.</p> 
<p>In some ways investigating suspected plagiarism is easier on the web. 
&nbsp; Unhappily, I have discovered several instances where my students lifted 
parts of their work (in two cases the entire paper) from sources that were not 
cited.&nbsp; Finding these instances of plagiarism was much easier in their web 
documents due to the ability to search for suspected phrases in web search 
engines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Plagiarism has always been and will always be a problem in education and 
research.&nbsp; The problem is exacerbated by computing technologies due to the 
ease of selecting all or part of a document and clicking on (Edit, Copy) and 
(Edit, Paste).&nbsp; Culprits do not even have to type the text.&nbsp; If they 
cleverly use the technologies, phrases can be easily modified so it becomes 
more difficult to discover that the passage was first lifted and then modified 
so as to escape detection.</p> 
<p>One problem with emerging <strong>speech recognition technologies</strong> 
is that spoken words (e.g., in a lecture or a session at a conference) can be 
recorded and digitized automatically such that text that has never appeared in 
print is created by speech recognition software.&nbsp; How easy it becomes to 
beat the speaker in putting that speaker's presentation into printed text.
<strong>Faculty clinging to traditional lectures and classroom case discussions 
may not even be aware that whatever went on in their classrooms is now 
available at hidden sites on the web at either a public or a private web 
site.&nbsp;</strong>Those infamous &quot;fraternity files&quot; have never been 
so rich as they will become with speech recognition technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns About Faculty Efficiency and Burnout</strong></p> 
<p><b>Online education is now part of &quot;fabric&quot; of public

professors are not happy about lack of support from administrators.</b><br>
 
&quot;Going For Distance,&quot; by Steve Kolowich, I<i>nside Higher Ed</i>
,&nbsp; August 31, 2009 ---<br>
 
http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/08/31/survey </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Online education is no longer a peripheral phenomenon at public 
universities, but many academic administrators are still treating it that way.
</p> 
<p>So says  a comprehensive study released today by the Association of Public 
and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) and the Sloan National Commission on Online 
Learning, which gathered survey responses from more than 10,700 faculty members 
and 231 interviews with administrators, professors, and students at APLU 
institutions.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a call to action,&rdquo; said Jack Wilson, 
president of the University of Massachusetts and chair of the Sloan online 
learning commission. &ldquo;The leadership of universities has been trying to 
understand exactly how [online education] fits into their strategic plans, and 
what this shows is that faculty are ahead of the institutions in these online 
goals.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>According to the study, professors are open to teaching online courses 
(defined in the study as courses where at least 80 percent of the course is 
administered on the Web), but do not believe they are receiving adequate 
support from their bosses. On the whole, respondents to the faculty survey 
rated public universities &ldquo;below average&rdquo; in seven of eight 
categories related to online education, including support for online course 
development and delivery, protection of intellectual property, incentives for 
developing and delivering online courses, and consideration of online teaching 
activity in promotion and tenure decisions.</p> 
<p>Still, more than a third of the faculty respondents had developed and 
taught an online course.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The urban legend out there was that many faculty out there 
don&rsquo;t want to participate&rdquo; in online education, said Wilson. 
&ldquo;Contrary to popular myths, faculty at all ages and levels are 
participating.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Indeed, neither seniority nor tenure status held a significant bearing on 
whether a professor had ever developed or taught an online course. At the time 
the survey was administered, there were more professors with at least 20 
years&rsquo; experience teaching an online course than professors with five 
years&rsquo; experience or less.</p> 
<p>This despite the fact that developing and teaching a course online is more 
taxing than doing the same in a classroom -- according to the survey 
respondents, teaching online isn&rsquo;t easy. &ldquo;Faculty who get involved 
in online teaching have to be more reflective about their teaching,&rdquo; 
Wilson said. Professors need to organize lecture notes and other materials with 
more care. They get more feedback from students. It&rsquo;s more apparent when 
a student is falling behind and needs special attention.</p> 
<p>Almost two-thirds of the faculty said it takes more effort to teach a 
course online than in a classroom, while 85 percent said more effort is 
required to develop one. While younger professors seem to have an easier time 
teaching online than older ones, more than half of respondents from the 
youngest faculty group agreed it was more time-consuming. Nearly 70 percent of 
all professors cited the extra effort necessary to develop Web courses as a 
crucial barrier to teaching online.</p> 
<p>So if teaching an online course is a ton of work and support from 
administrators is lacking, why bother doing it? Most professors said they are 
motivated by their students&rsquo; need for flexible access to course 
materials, and a belief that the Web allows them to reach certain types of 
student more effectively.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As a faculty member, when you&rsquo;re teaching online, suddenly you 
have to be teaching 24/7,&rdquo; said Samuel Smith, president emeritus of 
Washington State University. &ldquo;&hellip;It&rsquo;s more difficult, but the 
students get more contact.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Given the extra work, more than 60 percent of faculty see inadequate 
compensation as a barrier to the further development of online courses. 
&ldquo;If these rates of participation among faculty are going to continue to 
grow, institutions will have do a better job acknowledging the additional time 
and effort on the part of the faculty member,&rdquo; said Jeff Seaman, 
co-director of the Babson Survey Research Group and the study&rsquo;s lead 
researcher. For some, that might mean that their online work should figure into 
tenure and promotion decisions. For others, &ldquo;acknowledgment&rdquo; might 
equate to some extra cash in their paycheck.</p> 
<p>This is not a new request -- nor is the fact that it takes longer to 
develop and administer a college course online a new revelation. The American 
Federation of Teachers report on guidelines for good practice in distance 
education acknowledges that it takes &ldquo;anywhere from 66 to 500 percent 
longer&rdquo; to prepare an online course than a face-to-face one, and 
&ldquo;additional compensation should be provided to faculty to meet the 
extensive time commitments of distance education.&rdquo; The report noted that 
only half of the faculty it surveyed reported receiving extra compensation. 
That was in 2000.</p> 
<p>The authors of today's APLU study conclude by recommending that public 
universities not only institute policies that &ldquo;acknowledge and 
recognize&rdquo; professors&rsquo; online education efforts, but also work 
develop &ldquo;mechanisms that effectively incorporate online learning into the 
fabric and missions of the institutions.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now a factual statement that online learning is woven 
into the fabric of higher education,&rdquo; Wilson said. &ldquo;It has grown 
faster over the last six years than any other sector of higher education 
&hellip; and it will keep growing.&rdquo; </p> </blockquote>

<p>Barbara Brown wrote the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There are many myths and tacit assumptions about computer-mediated learning 
that can be explored in the Fielding context. Much has been written about 
technological efficiency and the potential of the Internet as an educational 
medium to save time and money or increase productivity. The author&#146;s 
experience inspires a healthy skepticism in this regard. Having taught students 
in conventional classrooms for two decades, I experienced the computer-mediated 
mode of instruction as more time-consuming, at least initially, both from the 
standpoint of up-front course design and later, painstaking, labor intensive 
hours online - designing messages for the classroom forum, reading and 
downloading from the screen, posting new material, providing feedback, checking 
community bulletin boards, e-mailing student comments and grade reports, etc. 
In fact, there were many times when I felt torn between my real life and my 
virtual life on-screen, in an identity challenging &quot; Turkle[Turkle, Sherry 
(1995),<em>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</em>, New 
York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.] sort of way, simply because there did not seem 
to exist enough hours in the day to do justice to both. This was the case even 
in an &quot;asynchronous&quot; environment where I had the flexibility to 
conduct electronic office hours in my bathrobe over morning coffee or post 
feedback in the dead of night.</p> 
<p>Moreover, absent face-to-face contact and ordinary non-verbal clues, even 
very mature students on the Internet demand more frequent interaction and 
reassurance in dialogue with their professors, an observation confirmed in 
student course evaluations. Students demand more feedback; and the more 
feedback they receive, the more interaction they want. There are at least two 
possible interpretations of this phenomenon: One is that it reflects the way 
students compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction. Or, it may be 
that this medium disinhibits student communication, thereby stimulating the 
message exchange process. As the intellectual excitement of these conversations 
grows, so does the amount of interactivity in the virtual community.[See 
Rafaeli, Sheizaf and Fay Sudweeks (1998), &quot;Interactivity in the 
Nets,&quot; in<em>Network &amp; Net Play</em>: Virtual Groups on the Internet,
<br> Menlo Park, CA: AAAI Press/The MIT Press]</p> 
<p>I estimate this mode of instruction requires roughly 40% to 50% more work 
on the teacher&#146;s part in comparison with conventional classroom delivery. 
For example, where I might put approximately 36 hours of work per week 
routinely into a regular course load with a total of 120 students in four 
traditional class sections at a large public university, online instruction at 
Fielding required 50 hours or more per week - with only 24 students in just 
three sections of my digital classes. It also takes longer for faculty members 
and administrators to reach consensus in electronic group meetings.</p>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Misleading and Fraudulent Web Sites</b></strong>
</p> 
<p>An emerging area of interest to me is the rate at which marginal and 
fraudulent asynchronous courses and programs are emerging. For example, I 
consider it shame when someone other than a major university uses a domain name 
of that university. One of my students, Elizabeth Eudy, wrote the following at
http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/eeudy/aln.htm</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I may be mistaken in the specific case, but the person in Reykjavik, 
Iceland who owns the domain name CarnegieMellon.com seems well positioned to 
offer services in a way that just might be confused with services offered by a 
well known U.S. university. Hundreds of examples exist of domain names that 
seem purposely designed to be misleading...Two problems stem from this: First, 
there is no way for the typical user to know whether the actual location of an 
Internet site is in, say, Pittsburgh or Reykjavik. Second, these sites are not 
under any single legal jurisdiction. The FBI, for instance, probably has little 
clout in Reykjavik</p> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Computer Services and Network Reliability</b>
</strong></p> 
<p>This morning I went to one of our student labs to check to see if one of my 
new ToolBooks was being transported properly on the Internet.&nbsp; I 
discovered that someone had wiped out both the Internet Explorer and the 
Netscape Communicator web browsers on the first three lab computers that I 
logged into.&nbsp; It is terribly frustrating for faculty and students to 
repeatedly encounter hardware and software failures.&nbsp; Student frustrations 
center around not having enough lab computers, wasting time on lab computers 
that fail, having their own computers crash during the semester, and 
encountering network crashes or delays due to clogged bandwidth.</p> 
<p>An enormous problem for universities who engage more and more in ALN 
courses that rely daily upon networking systems is to keep those systems 
efficient and reliable for students.&nbsp; Faculty members occasionally miss 
class due to illness or scheduling conflicts, but faculty miss class much less 
often than computers crash on most campuses.&nbsp; In addition, there are 
disruptions due to necessary maintenance and updating of computer 
systems.&nbsp; Few, if any, campuses have budgets to provide backup systems for 
disruptions of service.</p> 
<p>There are increasing risks of security failures on campus 
computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Geeks hack or crack their way into systems on every 
college campus.&nbsp; In most instances they do so without intent to cause 
great harm.&nbsp; However, they may also be intent upon bringing down the 
system or parts thereof.&nbsp; Equipping divisions (e.g., a College of Business 
within the university) with their own servers, labs, and computing maintenance 
centers reduces the risks of university-wide computer system failure, but the 
cost becomes enormous in terms of hardware and personnel costs.&nbsp; However, 
this may also spread technician talent so thin across the campus that the risk 
of poor performance in some divisions may be increased.</p> 
<p>There are no easy solutions to the problem that ALN learning is absolutely 
dependent on reliability of computers and networking systems.</p>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Effectiveness of Learning Technologies in Large 
Classes</b></strong></p> 
<p>Email messages from Roger Debreceny and Andrew Priest</p> 
<p>I do not doubt for a minute that small group, f2f teaching <b>can</b> be 
highly effective. I sure hope so, because like many of the people on this list, 
I have devoted many hours of my life to the pursuit of better f2f small group 
teaching! &lt;g&gt;.</p> 
<p>As regards large group f2f teaching, I am much less sanguine. I lecture to 
a group of 750 students (!!) in one large (ok, it&#146;s enormous!) lecture 
theatre. There are clearly<b>some</b> benefits to such large group teaching 
(mostly sociological) but not many. In most cases, large group lectures are 
poorly presented, inadequately planned and almost completely lacking in 
challenges to the students. Large group lectures lead, in my view, to the 
&quot;I attend, therefore I learn&quot; syndrome. We all know that all the 
evidence points to the inability of humans to concentrate in such environments 
for more than a few minutes at a time. Yet we consistently ignore such evidence.
</p> 
<p>There are many problems, however, with both small group and large group f2f 
teaching and learning processes. Key amongst them is the idea that we engender 
in our students, that they can go to a sage and receive knowledge in some 
structured fashion. Contrast that with our research processes. OK, we do have 
research tutorials (e.g. at the AAA Annual Meeting), but they are relatively 
rare. Research is undertaken by search for, and integration of, knowledge. 
Research is much, much more like the real work world that our graduates will 
experience than the f2f classroom.</p> 
<p>Where networked technology can assist us is to change the teaching and 
learning model from sage/pupil towards research leader/co-researcher.</p> 
<p>We should listen more to the ideas of thinkers such as Schank (see, for 
example, a short article by Schank in the July issue of Communications of the 
ACM).</p> 
<p>Now, just as an example of a colleague who has made some interesting 
advances in using networked technologies to move from pedagogy more towards 
androgogy here is a write-up on Mark Freeman at University of Technology, 
Sydney that was recently posted to ATeach-L by Andrew Priest. We can get a 
flavour of a new learning environment.</p> <b> </b> 
<p><b>Roger Debreceny</b></p> 
<p>=============================</p> <b> </b>
<p><b>Hi Folks</b></p> 
<p>Thought this article from the Business Review Weekly http://www.brw.com.au 
may be of interest.</p> <b> </b>
<p><b>Regards Andrew Priest</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Mass lectures, often repeated, are the usual way that university business 
courses cope with cost pressures and student loads. Students are bored to tears 
by them. Mark Freeman, a senior lecturer in finance at the University of 
Technology, Sydney (UTS), and a specialist in teaching methods, thinks he has 
found a better way: using the Internet. &quot;The groundswell of student 
interest in Web-based learning is like no other phenomenon I have seen in 
educational innovation,&quot; he says, after tests involving more than 2000 
students.</p> 
<p>At 4 am students can have lively interchanges on the site.</p> 
<p>Business students make up 30% of the enrolment at UTS but their courses get 
only 15% of total UTS funding. Freeman felt an obligation to make learning 
better for students who are struggling to hold down a job or cope with English, 
pay fees, mind children and resist fatigue at night. They may travel to 
university and find there are 30-40 students in a tutorial. Or part-timers 
might visit reserved sections of the library, only to find that desperate 
students have torn out the pages of a book or stolen it altogether.</p> 
<p>Freeman began Internet-based teaching in 1996 with 800 students on a basic 
Internet system. Last year UTS brought in experimentally a special on-line 
teacher-student pack called TopClass for messages and conferences, involving 
1000 students. This year 10,500 students, nearly half the UTS student 
population of 23,000, are using it. In one class of 100 last month, Freeman 
found that every student had private Internet access.</p> 
<p>Some academics misuse the medium by merely posting their lectures on the 
Web, he says. This is no better than telling students that information is in 
the library and &quot;go get it&quot;.</p> 
<p>One of Freeman&#146;s examples of &quot;new learning&quot; is an on-line 
role-playing exercise this year for post-graduate students of securities 
markets law. They take the identity of people such as John Howard, Allan Fels, 
or securities regulators, with their real identities staying secret until the 
program ends. The program was based on a method used at Macquarie University in 
a simulation of Middle-Eastern politics.</p> 
<p>In the first week the students describe their roles; then crises are 
provided, such as a currency slump, bank failure or misleading prospectus for a 
privatisation. Students must research how their character would react, and type 
responses to the central on-line site. The &quot;prime minister&quot; can even 
negotiate privately with the &quot;stock exchange chairman&quot;, as occurs in 
the real world. Freeman is the only observer able to read the messages. Since 
each student researches a unique situation, cheating is difficult. In normal 
work, cheating is a serious problem, now that vast amounts of material can be 
cut and pasted into assignments or lifted from &quot;cheat sites&quot; on the 
Web.</p> 
<p>In team debates, groups take positions on issues such as corporate law 
reform, and hone their responses in private conferences before posting them on 
the Internet. Many students in their professional lives are already feeling the 
effect of corporate law reform, and have strong opinions. Even at 4am there can 
be lively interchanges among six students using the site.</p> 
<p>Freeman says: &quot;Students get completely immersed in the role playing. 
In addition they do not have the hang-ups often suffered by people in 
face-to-face arguments, such as deferring to those of the opposite sex or those 
perceived to be higher in status. Shy people are not argued down, rhetorical 
flourishes can&#146;t be used, and non-English students cope better with the 
language.&quot;</p> 
<p>Later there is a coming-out session at the university where the students 
show their real identities, often to surprise and applause. The debate is also 
a permanent and expandable record useful for future students. &quot;The best 
part is that the students are not learning just what I tell them, but learning 
to think and make choices based on good information.&quot; An individual 
assignment is to investigate and give an assessment of a domestic and 
international securities regulator&#146;s Web site, and present the results to 
a discussion forum.</p> 
<p>Freeman admits to having the usual failures of a pioneer. &quot;Technology 
in teaching can operate like an unguided missile unless the goals are well 
specified, such as changing student understanding,&quot; he says.</p> 
<p>There is less staff administrative work because the Web is used for 
announcements, such as where to lodge assignments, errors in a text, changes to 
deadlines, and guides to marking. Staff have to discourage students from 
calling by phone and private e-mail, instead of logging on to the site.</p> 
<p>But there is still a huge workload in the Internet-posted queries. Some 
students at other universities became irate when Freeman failed to respond to 
their queries. Students expect staff to respond seven days a week, and mark 
faster. Now, without the Internet, the requests would be totally unmanageable. 
&quot;I used to get 40 calls on my voice-mail before I even started work. This 
morning I had none,&quot; Freeman says. He predicts that in the coming decade, 
some universities will fail, especially those that have chased short-term 
economies at the expense of quality. Students are already exercising their 
consumer rights and demanding &quot;just-in-time&quot; learning, rather than 
conforming to university teaching schedules. University teachers failing to get 
average grades of &quot;highly satisfactory&quot; would be sacked, since 
students would no longer tolerate mediocrity and would take their 
&quot;business&quot; elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Freeman predicted six months ago that many universities would become 
user-pays systems where for $1000, for example, students could use a bare 
minimum of the facilities, and pay $100 each for a menu of add-ons such as 
on-line self-study material, videos and discussion groups. Replies within 24 
hours would be guaranteed seven days a week, with a ceiling of ten sessions per 
subject and $100 per chat thereafter. There could be a $500 premium service 
involving time with experts face-to-face, on-line or in video-conference. 
&quot;In the US, user-pays universities have already arrived,&quot; Freeman 
says. &quot;It&#146;s no longer a prediction.&quot;&#151;</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong><b>Concerns About Faculty Resistance to Change</b></strong></p> 
<p>Probably the major stumbling block to education change is faculty 
unwillingness to venture into technology and new learning experiments.&nbsp; 
Instead of leading the way, faculty in traditional schools and colleges are 
behind corporate and military/goverment trainers in adapting to technologies 
and learning experimentation.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A funny thing happened to a campus event designed to bring our faculty 
together to exchange information and demonstrations of technology in the 
classroom. In the three years since the conference was launched, we have had 
steadily fewer faculty attending.</p> 
<p>We surveyed our faculty to find out why attendance had declined at our 
on-campus technology conference (scheduled during a day when classes were not 
in session). Results indicated that while some faculty and staff did have a 
disinterest in technology, more often the problem was their frustration with 
it. Among reasons for why they were not using technology in their work, they 
cited lack of the following: training, support, space, equipment, and knowledge 
of what was available and how items could be obtained.</p> </blockquote>

<p>======================================================================== 
</p> 
<p>Reply from Bob Jensen</p> 
<p>Hi ______</p> 
<p>One problem with web publishing is that if you submit your stuff to a top 
journal, the editor wants you to hide your research from the world until the 
journal gets around to publishing your work (which in a recent case took five 
years &quot;in press&quot; for an accepted Jensen and Sandlin article to 
finally get published). I recently had another paper accepted for publication. 
Then I had a long &#145;fight&quot; with the editor over whether I can keep a 
&quot;live&quot; and ever-changing version of the essence of that paper at my 
web site.</p> 
<p>I have discussed web publishing with administrators is many universities. 
They have not and cannot take much of an official position without action by 
the faculty. Matters of promotion and tenure are pretty well decided all along 
the way (departmental faculty, Chair, Dean, and P&amp;T faculty) with rare 
administrative reversals of recommendations. Faculty bring individual biases 
into peer evaluation, and at the moment web publishing is a new thing to most 
of them. Until the peer evaluation culture is changed, web publishing will not 
count heavily toward promotion, tenure, or take home pay.</p> 
<p>The main issue is that web publishing is not refereed with the same rigor 
(as refereeing in leading journals) or, in most cases, is not refereed at all. 
This is a concern since it is pretty easy to disguise garbage as treasure at a 
web site. Leading journals will one day offer refereeing services for web 
publishing and may, in fact, do away with their hard copy editions. Until then 
what do we do? Most certainly we do not put up a web counter and brag about the 
number of hits --- Playboy probably gets more hits per day than all professors 
combined.</p> 
<p>Somewhat of a substitute for hard core refereeing is a record of 
correspondence that is received from scholars and students who use your web 
documents. This lacks the anonymity of the refereeing process. Also there are 
opportunities to cheat (I&#146;ll lavishly praise your work if you will adore 
mine in a succession of email messages), but most scholars have more integrity 
than to organize that sort of conspiracy. If you have a file of correspondence 
from people that your peers know and respect, chances are that your peers will 
take notice. Include copies of this correspondence in your performance reports. 
But this process is more anecdotal than the genuine blind refereeing process.
</p> 
<p>Until a rigorous web refereeing process is established, those who must 
evaluate a web publisher must do more work. They must study your web materials 
and make their own judgments regarding quality and relevance. It is much easier 
to simply tick off the refereed hits (For when the binary scorer comes to write 
against your name, he writes only ones or zeros, to him the unread articles are 
all the same). It is easy to become too cynical about the refereeing process. 
We have all had frustrations with bad referees, including acceptances of our 
weaker output and rejections of our best work. At my web site, I have section 
for my &quot;big ones that got away.&quot; See
http://WWW.Trinity.edu/rjensen/#BigOnes Refereeing is a little like democracy 
--- it ain&#146;t perfect, but until a better system comes along it beats the 
alternatives over the long haul.</p> 
<p>My trouble, and I suspect that Mike Kearl has the same problem, is that web 
publishing is addictive. The responses that you get from around the world set 
&quot;your tail wagging.&quot; I have published many papers and several books 
(a sign of my advanced age), but I have never had the &quot;action&quot; 
following hard copy publication that I get from web publication. There are many 
reasons for this, including the fact that more people than you can imagine 
stumble on your web documents while using a search engine on the web. Not all

<p>Messages like the above message &quot;keep my tail wagging.&quot; I even 
like the messages that signal items to be corrected --- at least those users 
found my stuff worth correcting. If you have audio on your computer, you can 
listen to Mike Kearl discuss what makes his &quot;tail wag.&quot; Mike also 
discusses the issue that you raised in your message to me. The web address for 
Mike&#146;s audio on this is athttp://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/ideasmes.htm . 
That particular article is entitled &quot;Daring Professors&quot; and contains 
audio and email messages from other faculty members who were willing to take 
some chances with their careers.</p> 
<p>I can offer you a wagging tail and small pay raises if you rely entirely on 
web publishing as evidence of scholarship. Old hounds like me can opt for more 
tail wagging, but young pups need more nourishment shoved into the other end. 
(Actually I still publish hard copy to maintain respectability, but I 
personally am far more proud of my &quot;living&quot; web research documents 
than my annual refereed &quot;dead&quot; hits over the past few years).</p> 
<p>Until the evaluation culture is changed in peers who hold you on leash, try 
to do web publishing alongside your refereed journal publishing. But don&#146;t 
let the tail wag the dog or you will wind up in the dog house. If your book or 
journal editor objects to having your working documents published at your web 
site, remember who your master is at all times. His title is Editor in Chief!

<p><b>Concerns About Attrition and Drop Out Rates from Online Courses</b></p> 
<p>August 31, 2007 message from Carolyn Kotlas  [kotlas@email.unc.edu] </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>REDUCING ATTRITION IN ONLINE CLASSES </b> </p> 
<p>&quot;Attrition rates for classes taught through distance education are 10- 
20% higher than classes taught in a face-to-face setting. . . . Finding ways to 
decrease attrition in distance education classes and programs is critical both 
from an economical and quality viewpoint. High attrition rates have a negative 
economic impact on universities.&quot;</p> 
<p>In &quot;Strategies to Engage Online Students and Reduce Attrition 
Rates&quot; (THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATORS ONLINE, vol. 4, no. 2, July 2007), the 
authors provide a review of the literature to determine methods for 
&quot;engaging students with the goals of enhancing the learning process and 
reducing attrition rates.&quot; Their research identified four major strategies:
</p> 
<p>-- student integration and engagement </p> 
<p>Includes &quot;faculty-initiated contact via phone calls, pre-course 
orientations, informal online chats, and online student services.&quot;</p> 
<p>-- learner-centered approach </p> 
<p>Faculty &quot;need to get to know their students and assess each student's 
pre-existing knowledge, cultural perspectives, and comfort level with 
technology.&quot;</p> 
<p>-- learning communities </p> 
<p>&quot;[S]trong feelings of community may not only increase persistence in 
courses, but may also increase the flow of information among all learners, 
availability of support, commitment to group goals, cooperation among members 
and satisfaction with group efforts.&quot;</p> 
<p>-- accessibility to online student services. </p> 
<p>Services might include &quot;assessments, educational counseling, 
administrative process such as registration, technical support, study skills 
assistance, career counseling, library services, students' rights and 
responsibilities, and governance.&quot;</p>

Deborah Natvig, is available at  http://www.thejeo.com/Volume4Number2/Angelino

<p>Jensen Comment<br>
 Attrition rates are high because online students are 
often adults with heavy commitments to family and jobs. Initially they think 
they are going to have time for a course, but then the course becomes too 
demanding and/or unexpected things happen in their lives such as computer 
crashes, a change in job demands (such as more travel), family illness, marital 
troubles, etc. Sometimes online students initially believe the myth that online 
courses are easier than onsite courses and, therefore, take less time. About 
the only time saved is the logistical time waster of commuting to and from a 
classroom site.</p>

<h2>A Message from Peter Kenyon on November 18, 1999 </h2> 
<blockquote> 
<p>My own experience is with a three-semester experiment of a non-majors 
&quot;survey&quot; course. We met as a class once at the beginning of the 
semester and once again at the final exam. Without presuming that my experience 
can be generalized to others, I've made the following observations.</p> 
<p>It was MUCH more work to prepare and execute the course than I ever 
expected. I covered a little less material than in the traditional course. 
Assessment was very difficult. Student reaction was strong and about equally 
divided between those who loved it and those who hated it. DL seems better 
suited to mature learners with well-developed learning skills.</p> 
<p>In the end, I concluded their was little for me to like about this mode of 
instruction. It takes away the part of my job I like best (classroom 
interaction) and substituted mass quantities of gizmo tweaking (GT). Improved 
tools will reduce the need for GT, but I don't see how we maintain interesting 
human interaction. I use gizmos to support traditional instruction, but I have 
no desire to give up the classroom.</p> 
<p>As Barry Rice says, the traditional classroom MAY be a dinosaur in need of 
extinction. But when it does, I'll find other work to do because there's little 
joy for me as a cyber-prof.</p> 
<p>Peter Kenyon [pbk1@AXE.HUMBOLDT.EDU ]</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The most frequent refrain that I hear from my wife is: &quot;Did you hear 
what I just said?&quot; I am sorry to say that I often must ask Erika to repeat 
both that question and the her comments preceding the question. In fact, my 
penchant for listening without hearing has become somewhat of a joke between 
us. She has threatened to learn about computers just to communicate with me. 
Her problem is that she is just too busy to learn about computers. When she 
does find the time, however, I'm in for big trouble. Seriously, however, when I 
am in the midst of concentrating on one thing, I have a bit of the same problem 
with student communications on other issues.</p> 
<p>I agree with Peter and Ron&nbsp; to a point. However, the Sloan Foundation 
Experiments suggest that faculty/student and student/student communications 
increase with asynchronous courses. Students who rarely take the trouble to 
visit faculty during office hours will send email and chat room communications. 
Students have a penchant for catching us in our offices at a bad time, and they 
become embarrassed that it is a bad time. The trouble is that, being so busy, 
there is rarely a really good time for us to really communicate face-to-face. 
Sometimes students have to wait outside our offices, and being human, they 
conclude that they have better things to do with their time --- such as seeking 
out a teaching assistant or another student in the class. I sometimes think my 
&quot;former&quot; students know be better, via email, after graduation than 
while they were my students. Perhaps it is because they learn to appreciate my 
work more after they have graduated. But I am certain there is more to it than 
that.</p> 
<p>I taught in five universities over the years and encountered a few, 
surprisingly few, professors who have great face-to-face encounters with 
students outside the classroom. There are many (like me) who seem to do better 
with electronic communications. Years ago, I encountered an assistant professor 
from a prestigious university who reported that the only way for faculty or 
students to really make contact (before email was invented) with one of the 
superstars on the faculty was through written memos even though that superstar 
was located two doors down the hall.</p> 
<p>For more on the relation between communications and pedagogy, see 
http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/slide01.htm. For more on student evaluations, 
see the course evaluations at 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois. What seems to be more of a 
problem with asynchronous courses seems to be faculty burn out that, in large 
measure, is caused by increased communications with students. Asynchronous 
courses are also more demanding on materials development. Much of what we 
expound in lectures comes from long-term memory that is triggered by something 
(patterns of association) in the midst of class. Beforehand, the same thoughts 
may not have surfaced in our offices that surface in the middle of a class. 
This makes it almost impossible to write down down complete lectures for 
asynchronous courses having no lectures.</p> 
<p>Electronic communications, of course, are not as satisfactory in many 
respects as face-to-face encounters. However, I would argue that electronic 
communications are sometimes &quot;closer.&quot; For example, there are times 
when I feel a bit intimidated myself in the presence of some people that I 
communicate freely with by email. There are people that I hate to interrupt 
with a telephone call, but I am rarely embarrassed to send them email messages. 
After a face-to-face or telephone visit, there are almost always things that I 
belatedly think that I should have said or not said. This seems to be less of a 
problem with email, and when it happens I just send out correction/addendum 
messages.</p> 
<p>My point here is to avoid associating &quot;closeness&quot; with 
&quot;face-to-face.&quot; We can be virtual strangers face-to-face and close 
friends over a network. We may repeat daily greetings with colleagues in the 
hallways who we rarely communicate with in depth. I am less close with 
colleagues that I &quot;see&quot; in our hallways than with many of you with 
whom I correspond regularly. There have been some studies (one was reported in 
Playboy) showing that husbands and wives that see each other every day have a 
surprisingly small amount of genuine communication except at certain peak 
moments such as when they are in a car together on a long trip or awaiting a 
meal by candlelight in a slow-service restaurant. Would some us learn more 
about our spouses and kids if we communicated anonymously or openly with them 
via email and chat rooms? Will our kids open up more to anonymous strangers on 
the web than they will face-to-face with us.</p> 
<p>But then maybe I am just &quot;listening&quot; to Peter and Ron without 
&quot;hearing.&quot;</p>

<p>Peter made one comment that I suspect reflects the sentiments of many 20th 
century educators- any technology that detracts from our ability to physically 
connect with our students is going to diminish our career satisfaction. While I 
share this sentiment whole heartedly, I believe that we confront two 
inescapable realities in 21st century education.</p> 
<p>First, distributed education (whether distance or proximity) is going to 
become a more prominent feature of the academic landscape. Second, students are 
going to become increasingly comfortable with online social interaction and 
communities.</p> 
<p>Given those two &quot;assumptions,&quot; most (if not all) educators must 
learn how to develop an appropriate classroom community in cyberspace. To me, 
that means having a community that fulfills all participants' needs to connect, 
while achieving academic objectives. A difficult challenge when the 
participants come from two generations that define connecting and community in 
such different ways.</p> 
<p>I have not had a chance to read it, yet, but some might find &quot;Building 
Learning Communities in Cyberspace,&quot; (Palloff and Pratt) to be informative.

<p><b>Student Evaluations and Learning Styles</b> </p> 
<p>Bob Jensen's threads on assessment are at 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is an enormous problem of assuming that students who wrote high 
evaluations of any course actually learned more than high performing students 
who hated the course.&nbsp; Happiness and learning are two different things.</p>
<p>Reasons why students often prefer online courses may have little or nothing 
to do with actual learning.&nbsp; At the University of North Texas where 
students can sometimes choose between an onsite or an online section of a 
course, some student just preferred to be able to take a course in their 
pajamas ---http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#NorthTexas&nbsp;<br>
 Some 
off-campus students prefer to avoid the hassle and time consumed driving to 
campus and spending a huge amount of time searching for parking.&nbsp; Some 
Mexico City students claim that they can save over five hours a day in 
commuting time, which is time made free for studying (Jim Parnell, Texas 
A&amp;M, in partnership with Monterrey Tech, deliver an ALN Web MBA Program in 
Mexico City) ---http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/0000start.htm&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In general, comparisons of onsite versus online test and grade performance 
will tend to show &quot;no differences&quot; among good students, because good 
students learn the material under varying circumstances.&nbsp; Differences are 
more noteworthy weaker students or students who tend to drop courses, but there 
is a huge instructor effect that is difficult to factor out of such studies.

<p><b>Online Learning Styles</b></p> 
<p>Here are a few links of possible interest with regard to student 
evaluations and online learning styles.&nbsp; In some cases you may have to 
contact to presenters to get copies of their papers. </p> 
<p> <b>Probably the best place to start is with the <i>Journal of Asynchronous 
Learning</i> --- http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/index.asp </b> </p> 
<p>For example, one of the archived articles is entitled 
&ldquo;&quot;Identifying Student Attitudes and Learning Styles in Distance 
Education&quot; in the September 2001 edition ---
http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/jaln/v5n2/v5n2_valenta.asp </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Three opinion types were identified in this study: Students who identified 
with issues of Time and Structure in Learning, Social Interaction in Learning, 
and Convenience in Learning. These opinions can be used to aid educators in 
reaching their students and increasing the effectiveness of their online 
courses. At UIC, this insight had direct application to the evolution of course 
materials. Early application of technology merely supplied a web site on which 
were posted syllabus, readings and assignments. No opportunity existed for 
conferencing; thus, there existed no opportunity for social learning. In a 
subsequent semester, conferencing software was made available to the class, in 
addition to the website. Thus, the opportunity was added for social learning. 
The faculty learned, however, that every time a new technology was added, it 
experienced an increase in the level of effort necessary to support the 
student. Ultimately, the University made available a course management system, 
which significantly streamlined the effort on the part of faculty to make 
course materials available to the student. The system provides through a single 
URL the student's access to course materials, discussion forums, virtual groups 
and chat, testing, grades, and electronic communication.</p> 
<p>This study is qualitative and confined to University of Illinois at Chicago 
graduate and undergraduate students. The three opinion types identified through 
this study, however, correlate closely with results reported in the literature. 
All three groups of students, representing the three opinion types, shared a 
belief in the importance of being able to work at home. The studies of Richards 
and Ridley [9] and Hiltz [10] described flexibility and convenience as both 
reasons students enrolled in online courses and as the perception of students 
once enrolled. On the other hand, all three groups of students thought 
unimportant the need to pay home phone bills incurred in online education, 
whereas Bee [13] found that students felt the university should provide 
financial assistance to offset the associated costs of going online. There is 
evidence in the literature (viz., studies by Guernsey [8] and Larson [18]) that 
support the opinion identified in this study of the need by some students for 
face-to-face interaction. Since none of the students taking the Q-sort had ever 
taken an online course, they were unaware of the opportunities provided by 
technology [8,10] to potentially increase individual attention from instructors 
above that normal in face-to-face course offerings. Since no post-enrollment 
Q-sorts were administered, there was no way to tell whether students continued 
to hold that opinion, or whether that opinion has changed. It is anticipated 
that even if the Q-set were administered to a larger number of students, 
similar viewpoints would still emerge.</p> 
<p>The authors wondered whether there was an association between the opinion 
set held by the student and his or her learning style. Preliminary data using 
the Canfield Learning Styles Inventory [27] show that the factor one 
group--Time and Structure in Learning--exhibited a much higher than expected 
proportion of independent learners. (74% of the students who had high factor 
loadings on factor one were also classified as independent learners. This 
difference was significant Z = 3.00, p &lt; .025.) One might be tempted to 
hypothesize a relationship between being an independent learner and having the 
time and structure opinion of technology and education. Similarly, one might 
also expect that individuals who had high factor loadings for factor two 
(Social Factors in Learning) would be more likely classified as social 
learners. Further research is necessary to understand how learning styles 
contribute to the experience of online education.</p> 
<p>There is a movement in both education and business to harness the power of 
the World Wide Web to disseminate information. Educators and researchers, aware 
of this technological paradigm shift, must become invested in understanding the 
interactions of students and computing. The field of human-computer interface 
design, as applied to interaction of students in online courses, is ripe for 
research in the area of building better virtual learning communities (thus 
addressing the needs of the social learner) without overwhelming the ability of 
the independent learner to excel on his or her own.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>Like some of the other well known cognitive and affective taxonomies, the 
Kolb figure illustrates a range of interrelated learning activities and styles 
beneficial to novices and experts. Designed to emphasize reflection on 
learners&rsquo; experiences, and progressive conceptualization and active 
experimentation, this kind of environment is congruent with the aim of lifelong 
learning. Randy Garrison points out that:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>From a content perspective, the key is not to inundate students with 
information. The first responsibility of the teacher or content expert is to 
identify the central idea and have students reflect upon and share their 
conceptions. Students need to be hooked on a big idea if learners are to be 
motivated to be reflective and self-directed in constructing meaning. 
Inundating learners with information is discouraging and is not consistent with 
higher order learning . . . Inappropriate assessment and excessive information 
will seriously undermine reflection and the effectiveness of asynchronous 
learning.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Reflection on a big question is amplified when it enters collaborative 
inquiry, as multiple styles and approaches interact to respond to the challenge 
and create solutions. In How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, 
John Bransford and colleagues describe a legacy cycle for collaborative 
inquiry, depicted in a figure by Vanderbilt University researchers&nbsp; (see

<p><b>Master Educators Who Deliver Exceptional Courses or Entire Programs <br>

 But Have Little Contact With Individual Students</b></p> 
<p>Before reading this section, you should be familiar with the document at  
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm#Teaching </p> 
<p>Master educators can also be outstanding researchers, although research is 
certainly not a requisite to being a master educator. Many master educators are 
administrators of exceptional accounting education programs. They're 
administrative duties typically leave little time for research, although they 
may write about education and learning. Some master educators are not even 
tenure track faculty.</p> 
<p>What I've noticed in recent years is how technology can make a huge 
difference. Nearly every college these days has some courses in selected 
disciplines because they are utilizing some type exciting technology. Today I 
returned from a trip to Jackson, Mississippi where I conduced a day-longCPE 
session on education technology for accounting educators in Mississippi (what 
great southern hospitality by the way). So the audience would not have to 
listen to me the entire day, I invited Cameron Earl from Brigham Young 
University to make a presentation that ran for about 90 minutes. I learned some 
things about top educators at BYU, which by the way is one of the most 
respected universities in the world. If you factor out a required religion 
course on the Book of Mormon, the most popular courses on the BYU campus are 
the two basic accounting courses. By popular I mean in terms of thousands of 
students who elect to take these courses even if they have no intention of 
majoring in business or economics where these two courses are required. Nearly 
all humanities and science students on campus try to sign up for these two 
accounting courses.</p> 
<p>After students take these two courses, capacity constraints restrict the 
numbers of successful students in these courses who are then allowed to become 
accounting majors at BYU. I mean I'm talking about a very, very small 
percentage who are allowed to become accounting students. Students admitted to 
the accounting program generally have over 3.7 minimum campus-wide grade 
averages.</p> 
<p>This begs the question of what makes the two basic accounting courses so 
exceptionally popular in such a large and prestigious university?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>These two basic accounting courses are not sought out for easy grades. In 
fact they are among the hardest courses for high grades at BYU. I think that 
this is probably true in most business schools in the nation.<br>
 &nbsp; </li> 
<li>These two BYU courses are not sought out for face-to-face contact with the 
instructor. The courses have thousands of students each term such that most 
students do not see the instructor outside of class even though he's available 
over ten hours per week for those who seek him out. Each course only meets in 
live classes eight times per semester. Most of the speakers in those eight 
classes are outstanding visiting speakers who add a great deal to the 
popularity of the course. This is often one difference between a course run by 
a master educator versus a master teacher. A master educator often brings in 
top talent to inspire and educate students.<br>
 &nbsp; </li> 
<li>The courses undoubtedly benefit from the the shortage of accounting 
graduates in colleges nationwide and the exceptional career opportunities for 
students who want careers in accounting, taxation, law, business management, 
government, criminal justice, and other organizations. But these accountancy 
advantages exist for every college that has an accounting education program. 
Most all colleges do not have two basic accounting courses that are sought out 
by every student in the entire university. That makes BYU's two basic 
accounting courses truly exceptional.<br>
 &nbsp; </li> 
<li>Some courses in every college are popular these days because they are 
doing something exceptional with technology. These two BYU courses increased in 
popularity when a self-made young man became a multimillionaire and decided to 
devote his life to being a master educator in these two accountancy courses at 
BYU. His name is Norman Nemrow. He runs these courses full time without salary 
at BYU and is neither a tenure track faculty member or a noted researcher at 
BYU. I think he qualifies, however, as an education researcher even if he does 
not publish his findings in academic journals. The video disks are available to 
anyone in the world for a relatively small fee that goes to BYU, but BYU is not 
doing this for purposes of making great profits. You can read more about how to 
get the course disks at the following links:<br>

<li>The students in these two courses learn the technical aspects of from 
variable-speed video disks that were produced by Norman and a team of video and 
learning experts. Cameron Earl is a recent graduate of BYU who is part of the 
technical team that delivers these two courses on video. Formal studies of 
Nemrow's video courses indicate that students generally prefer to learn from 
the video relative to live lectures. The course has computer labs run by 
teaching assistants who can give live tutorials to individual students, but 
most students who have the video disks for their own computers do not seek out 
the labs.</li> </ul> 
<p>Trivia Question<br>
 At BYU most students on campus elect to take Norman 
Nemrow's two basic accounting courses. In the distant past, what exceptional 
accounting professor managed to get his basic accounting courses required at a 
renowned university while he was teaching these courses?</p> 
<p>Trivia Answer<br>
 Bill Paton is one of the all-time great accounting 
professors in history. His home campus was the University of Michigan, and for 
a period of time virtually all students at his university had to take basic 
accounting (or at least so I was told by several of Paton's former doctoral 
students). Bill Paton was one of the first to be inducted into the Accounting 
Hall of Fame.</p> As an aside, I might mention that I favor requiring two basic 
accounting courses for every student admitted to a college or university, 
including colleges who do not even have business education programs. 
<p>But the &quot;required accounting courses&quot; would not, in my viewpoint, 
be a traditional basic accounting courses. About two thirds or more of these 
courses should be devoted to personal finance, investing, business law, tax 
planning. The remainder of the courses should touch on accounting basics for 
keeping score of business firms and budgeting for every organization in society.
</p> 
<p>At the moment, the majority of college graduates do not have a clue about 
the time value of money and the basics of finance and accounting that they will 
face the rest of their lives.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are other ways of being &quot;mastery educators&quot; without being 
master teachers in a traditional sense. Three professors of accounting at the 
University of Virginia developed and taught a year-long intermediate accounting 
case where students virtually had to teach themselves in a manner that they 
found painful and frustrating. But there are metacognitive reasons where the 
end result made this year-long active learning task one of the most meaningful 
and memorable experiences in their entire education --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/265wp.htm <br>
 They often painfully grumbled 
with such comments as &quot;everything I'm learned in this course I'm having to 
learn by myself.&quot;</p>

<p>One Web site that opened this week, Big Think,&nbsp; hopes to be &quot;a 
YouTube for ideas.&quot; The site offers interviews with academics, authors, 
politicians, and other thinkers. Most of the subjects are filmed in front of a 
plain white background, and the interviews are chopped into bite-sized pieces 
of just a few minutes each. The short clips could have been served up as text 
quotes, but Victoria R. M. Brown, co-founder of Big Think, says video is more 
engaging. &quot;People like to learn and be informed of things by looking and 
watching and learning,&quot; she says.</p> 
<p>YouTube itself wants to be a venue for academe. In the past few months, 
several colleges have signed agreements with the site to set up official 
&quot;channels.&quot; The University of California at Berkeley was the first, 
and the University of Southern California, the University of New South Wales, 
in Australia, and Vanderbilt University soon followed.</p> 
<p>It remains an open question just how large the audience for talking 
eggheads is, though. After all, in the early days of television, many academics 
hoped to use the medium to beam courses to living rooms, with series like CBS's
<i>Sunrise Semester.</i> which began in 1957. Those efforts are now a distant 
memory.</p> 
<p>Things may be different now, though, since the Internet offers a chance to 
connect people with the professors and topics that most interest them.</p> 
<p>Even YouTube was surprised by how popular the colleges' content has been, 
according to Adam Hochman, a product manager at Berkeley's Learning Systems 
Group. Lectures are long, after all, while most popular YouTube videos run just 
a few minutes. (Lonelygirl, the diary of a teenage girl, had episodes that 
finished in well under a minute. Many other popular shorts involve cute animals 
or juvenile stunts). Yet some lectures on Berkeley's channel scored 100,000 
viewers each, and people were sitting through the whole talks. &quot;Professors 
in a sense are rock stars,&quot; Mr. Hochman concludes. &quot;We're getting as 
many hits as you would find with some of the big media players.&quot;</p> 
<p>YouTube officials insist that they weren't surprised by the buzz, and they 
say that more colleges are coming forward. &quot;We expect that education will 
be a vibrant category on YouTube,&quot; said Obadiah Greenberg, strategic 
partner manager at YouTube, in an e-mail interview. &quot;Everybody loves to 
learn.&quot;</p> 
<p>To set up an official channel on YouTube, colleges must sign an agreement 
with the company, though no money changes hands. That allows the colleges to 
brand their section of the site, by including a logo or school colors, and to 
upload longer videos than typical users are allowed.</p> 
<p>The company hasn't exactly made it easy to find the academic offerings, 
though. Clicking on the education category shows a mix of videos, including 
ones with babes posing in lingerie and others on the lectures of Socrates. But 
that could change if the company begins to sign up more colleges and pay more 
attention to whether videos are appearing in the correct subject areas, says 
Dan Colman, director and associate dean of Stanford University's 
continuing-studies program, who runs a blog tracking podcasts and videos made 
by colleges and professors.</p> 
<p>In many cases, the colleges were already offering the videos they are 
putting on YouTube on their own Web sites, or on Apple's iTunes U, an

<blockquote> 
<p>Here's another question: I notice that education academics are poo-poo'ing 
the &quot;lecture&quot; delivery methodology (in favor of &quot;active 
learning&quot;, &quot;participatory education&quot;, &quot;learner physical 
engagement&quot;, etc.), but education *practitioners* are exponentially 
snowballing the production of &quot;sit down and watch me&quot;-type of passive 
&quot;entertainment&quot; delivery mechanisms....</p> 
<p>Could it be that accounting is not the only domain with a disconnect 
between academics and practitioners?</p> 
<p>Just a thought. ;-) </p> 
<p>Having suffered through raising a terribly attention-deficit child (and we 
know with certainty the early-childhood cause of this particular case), I can't 
help but marvel at how the short video clips (sound bites?) are catering to the 
learning styles of the present hyperactive generation of learners. --- This 
begs another question: Since much of human progress has resulted from in-depth 
understanding which requires longer-term periods of study and contemplation for 
full comprehension and synthesis, what long-term impact will the present 
ubiquity of these &quot;attention-deficit-reinforcing&quot; delivery mechanisms 
have on the development of intellect in the upcoming generation?</p> 
<p>Will there be an evolutionary morphosis in the process of human thought, 
some kind of change we haven't thought about or foreseen, where human intellect 
might no longer require lengthy periods of &quot;gearing up mentally&quot; in 
order to understand and comprehend and analyze and synthesize complex ideas and 
thoughts?</p>

<p>David,<br>
<br>
 With respect to your inquiry about short video clips and 
the potential consequences.&nbsp; I have found that when I moved my lectures 
online, I deliberately made them short, to cover just one or two main 
concepts.&nbsp; So that a lecture that covers financial accounting transactions 
that might have taken 1.5 hours or so in a traditional setting, can now be 
broken down into 4-5 shorter lectures.<br>
<br>
 In my experience students have 
a hard time concentrating for 1.5 hours on accounting topics - I'm not the best 
lecturer, but the material isn't all that stimulating at times either.&nbsp; So 
I tell my students when you can find 20 minutes of uninterrupted time, watch 
one of the lectures - give it your undivided attention.&nbsp; Do this once a 
day if you have to and then by the end of the week they will have 
listened/watched the entire lecture.<br>
<br>
 I'm not sure if this is 
reinforcing short attention spans or not, but I think it provides students a 
much better way to concentrate on the material.&nbsp; Then after watching a 
short video, they can spend quality time thinking about the lecture, doing 
problems, etc.&nbsp; It's this time, the working with the concepts, that to me 
seems the most important.<br>
<br>
 Just my 2 cents,<br>

<p>Hi Steve, </p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve just hit on the main comparative advantage of 
asynchronous/hypermedia learning (in which video can play a major part). 
Learners may focus on material when they are prepared to concentrate and replay 
material over and over that they did not master in previous attempts.</p> 
<p>Camtasia has made the video more interesting by making lectures much more 
than video of talking heads.</p> 
<p>It really helps to have variable speed video to increase the efficiency of 
the asynchronous learning process. Probably the greatest experiment of this for 
all time can be found in the year-long basic accounting courses at Brigham 
Young University (BYU) where virtually all technical matters in basic 
accounting are learned asynchronously on video with the possible (but not 
required) supplemental help from a textbook.</p> 
<p>Much of the absolutely tremendous experimental work on asynchronous 
learning (including BYU links on variable speed video) can be found at

<p>&quot;The SCALE Efficiency Projects,&quot; by Lanny Arvan et al --- 
http://www.alnresearch.org/Data_Files/articles/full_text/arvan2.htm&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This paper presents evidence from nine &quot;Efficiency Projects&quot; that 
were SCALE&rsquo;s focus in the 1997-98 academic year. The Efficiency Projects 
were specifically aimed at using ALN to achieve higher student/faculty ratios, 
without sacrificing instructional quality. The study concentrates on data 
amassed for the fall 1997 semester. Evidence was collected on the cost side, 
for ALN development and delivery, and the performance/attitude side, from both 
student and faculty perspectives. The study supports the view that when a 
sensible pedagogic approach is embraced that affords the students with avenues 
to communicate about their learning, ALN can produce real efficiency gains in 
courses without sacrificing the quality of instruction.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Student evaluations for the Fall 1995 semester are summarized at

<p> It appears that over the years, the links to the SCALE experiments are 
broken. Perhaps the study results are no longer freely online. You can of 
course read my summaries and listen to Dan Stone describe the program --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois </p> 
<p> I kept the PowerPoint slides for one course (micro economics) &nbsp;in the 
experiment at http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/slide01.htm <br>
 That course was 
very typical of many of the outcomes on grading.</p> 
<p> The principal investigator in the SCALE project was an economics professor 
named Lanny Arvan. I suspect he will willingly cooperate with researchers who 
really want to investigate his SCALE project --- 
http://www.economics.uiuc.edu/people/larvan/ <br>
 It was indeed a well funded 
research project.</p> 
<p> The Sloan Foundation may also have some SCALE reports that Lanny can point 
you to since much of the SCALE funding was Sloan money.</p> 
<p>The Executive Summary reads as follows: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>ALN Promoted ...</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Increased communications<br>
 &quot;I learned much more than I ever had due 
to the high interaction between student/student and student/teacher.&quot;<br>

<br> Survey results revealed 51% of the students reported an increase in 
communication with the instructor and 43% with other students. Approximately 
40% of the students reportedan increase in the quality of their interaction 
with the instructor. One professor wrote, &quot;I believe the quality of my 
interactions with students was the highest I have ever experienced.&quot; 
Students liked &quot;asking questions that couldn't be asked in class,&quot; 
&quot;better understanding different points of view,&quot; &quot;the ease in 
getting in touch with the professor,&quot; and &quot;talking more to my 
peers.&quot;<br>
</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Improved access to information<br>
<br>
 &quot;Information when you 
want/need it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Students liked having &quot;personal control of 
information&quot; and &quot;quick-response times from peers and students.&quot; 
They found that &quot;on-line testing was easy and convenient,&quot; 
&quot;study material was easy to access,&quot; &quot;material was never 
lost...and always available,&quot; the Web served &quot;as a great supplement 
to lectures,&quot; and they could&quot;pay more attention in class and worry 
less about taking notes.&quot;<br>
</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Added to learning environment<br>
<br>
 &quot;It added flavor to course, 
broadened it beyond just the classroom.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Students commented that 
ALN &quot;was a new and exciting way to learn&quot; that &quot;added 
depth&quot; to the class. It also enabled them &quot;to be more prepared for 
class,&quot; gave them &quot;a lot of time to learn out of class,&quot; and 
allowed them &quot;to work at own pace.&quot; Some students believed the 
&quot;on-line homework was a great experience&quot; and that on-line quizzes 
were &quot;a good way to study for exams.&quot; Survey results indicated 
approximately 70% of the students would like to take another course using 
computer conferencing. About 75% of the responding students rated their overall 
experience with computer conferencing good, very good, or excellent. 
Approximately 60% of the students reported an increase in the amount of their 
learning due to the use of computer conferencing.<br>
</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Facilitated the learning of computers<br>
<br>
 &quot;Increased my 
knowledge and confidence with computers.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Approximately 70% of 
the students indicated on the survey an increase in their familiarity with 
computers. Students reported &quot;feeling less apprehensive about using 
computers&quot; and thought that their ALN course provided &quot;a good 
opportunity to learn more about computers.&quot; <br>
</p> </li> </ul> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><br>
<strong>If/When </strong>...</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Students/Instructors were adequately trained<br>
<br>
 &quot;It might have 
affected the way I learned if I had been able to use it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
&quot;Make a mandatory class on how to use the system.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
Approximately 75% of the students responding to the survey found the use of 
FirstClass [FC] or PacerForum [PF] to be easy or somewhat easy. However, there 
were students in all but a few of the classes interviewed who expressed a 
desire for more or better training. Students requested &quot;more tutorial 
instruction,&quot; &quot;better documentation,&quot; and &quot;written 
instructions on how to get it [FC] from home.&quot; Some students thought their 
instructor should have &quot;introduced it sooner in the semester,&quot; 
provided a &quot;mandatory class on how to use the system&quot; and done a 
better job of &quot;explaining why we are doing it.&quot;</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Students made an effort<br>
<br>
 &quot;If you took the time to read what 
other class members had to say it was of great benefit to me and what I 
learned.&quot;<br>
<br>
 On the survey, approximately 60% of the students 
reported using computer conferencing at least once a week. Forty percent didn't 
use or minimally used conferencing. Females reported using conferencing 
slightly more than did males.<br>
<br>
 About one half of the students used 
campus computer labs when using the computer, while approximately one quarter 
used residence hall labs or accessed a computer in their apartment or residence 
hall room. When asked about computer participation in the ten class interviews 
typically a third to one half of the students indicated reading the postings of 
their classmates.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Instructors made an effort<br>
<br>
 &quot;If you are going to include it, 
give some sort of incentive to use it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Do more than just 
postings.&quot;<br>
<br>
 A consistent theme appears in the ten class 
interviews and survey results; most students will participate in ALN activities 
when (a) they know how to participate, (b) it isn't too difficult to do so, and 
(c) it is worth their time and effort. The first and third conditions can be 
directly addressed by the instructor, whereas the second condition requires 
campus support. Students seem to be less interested in participating when an 
instructor &quot;tacks on ALN to a course.&quot; In responding to various 
open-ended items on the survey the students are asking instructors to &quot;do 
more than just postings,&quot; &quot;to do more than answer questions,&quot; to 
use ALN &quot;more than once a week,&quot; to &quot;increase interactive 
programs,&quot; and to &quot;put useful things/readings on FC.&quot;<br>
</p> 
</li> 
<li>
<p>There was sufficient access to computers<br>
<br>
 &quot;It was more of a 
hassle than it was worth.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;The [modem] lines were always 
busy.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;It was hard to find an available computer.&quot; 
<br> <br>
Getting access to a computer was the most often cited complaint on 
the survey and in all of the class interviews. As one student explained, 
&quot;After standing in line for an hour I don't have time to do anything more 
than post my own work.&quot; &quot;Busy phone lines&quot; prevented some from 
working at home while others on campus were frustrated with &quot;filled 
computer labs.&quot; As one student summed up, &quot;Get more computers or get 
rid of it.&quot;<br>
</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>The computers and computer software were user-friendly<br>
<br>
 &quot;Have 
less technical problems.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Password didn't work.&quot; <br>

<br> &quot;I couldn't login, so I stopped using it.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Overall, 
most students appeared to find the Web, PF or FC software to be somewhat easy 
to use once they knew how to login and locate them at various computer sites. 
However, &quot;getting to the software&quot; was difficult for some. Students 
in all of the class interviews spoke of&quot;system crashes,&quot; 
&quot;inabilities to login due to password problems,&quot; or &quot;problems 
locating the programs at the different sites on campus.&quot; For some students 
these difficulties discouraged further use. Still other students wanted the 
software to do more. Their requests for &quot;an editor on PF,&quot; 
&quot;better graphing capabilities on FC,&quot; &quot;easier ways to transfer 
files,&quot; and &quot;better communication between FC and the Web&quot; 
addressed their needs for a more integrated computer package.<br>

<li>
<p>Beyond computer conferencing<br>
<br>
 Essentially, ALN in the Fall of 1995 
meant computer conferencing and course materials on the Web. Already the SCALE 
faculty are talking to us about building on their fall experience to use new 
technologies or to improve their use of those already tried. Said one 
professor, &quot;We still have room for improvement.&quot; New SCALE proposals 
also reveal expanded definitions of ALN including the implementation of video 
conferencing, interactive Web activities, and inter-institutional collaboration.
<br> </p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Improved access and training<br>
<br>
 Problems of computer access and 
technical difficulties will never go away entirely but they should be reduced 
as computer site monitors gain experience, additional modems are added to the 
campus infrastructure, lab sites are better prepared for student, using ALN 
software, and students/faculty learn from their mistakes.<br>
</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>The economies of SCALE<br>
<br>
 This semester 58% of the faculty 
responding to the survey reported taking more time than normal on their ALN 
courses. However,as faculty continue to refine their use of ALN the campus 
should expect to see some savings in costs and time. For example, two faculty 
members have told us of their plans to reduce the number of class meeting times 
based on their use of computer conferencing in the fall, while another 
professor is planning to co-teach a course with an instructor at another 
university.<br>
</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Enhanced performance<br>
<br>
Does ALN enhance student performance? At 
least three professors believed the students in their ALN courses outperformed 
students in the past. The evaluation team helped collect statistics for one 
professor wherein students who took on-line quizzes outperformed those who 
didn't. For the spring semester we are working with several professors who are 
structuring their courses to compare ALN and non-ALN taught students in terms 
of achievement. We may find some answers to the opening question.</p> </li>

<p>An interesting paper by William H. Geoghegan at IBM Academic Consulting is 
entitled &quot;WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY?&quot; discusses 
some of the issues as to why the faculty are not yet adapting to education 
technologies. Estimates run as high as 95% of higher education faculty are not 
using these technologies. Geoghegan analyses social and diffusion barriers in 
particular. The paper is at

<br>
 
Barriers to adaption appear to lie more with faculty and educational 
instututions than with students.</p> 
<p><b>Update on Lanny Arvan:&nbsp; From SCALE Experiments to Blogs</b></p> 
<p>Years ago economics professor Lanny Arvan directed the famous in a 
controlled SCALE experiments comparing resident full-time students at the 
University of Illinois taking onsite versus online courses from the same 
instructors using common grade assessment procedures. Thirty courses across 
multiple disciplines were examined across five years of experimentation ---<br>

 http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois <br>
 In spite of some 
technology glitches in those olden days, many students tended to prefer taking 
the courses online. Typically, many more students moved from B grades to A 
grades in online courses. However, there tended to not be much difference for D 
and F students, indicating that lack of motivation and aptitude cuts across 
online and onsite pedagogies in mostly the same way.</p> 
<p>In one of my technology workshops Dan Stone (then from the University of 
Illinois) gave us an overview that I still serve up his PowerPoint and audio 
files ---<br>

<p>&quot;<b>Teaching With Blogs</b>, by Lanny Arvan, <i>Inside Higher Ed</i>, 
July 27, 2010 ---<br>
 http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2010/07/27/arvan </p>
<blockquote> 
<p><i>&ldquo;It is my impression that no one really likes the new. We are 
afraid of it. It is not only as Dostoevsky put it that 'taking a new step, 
uttering a new word is what people fear most.' Even in slight things the 
experience of the new is rarely without some stirring of foreboding.&rdquo;</i>
<br> <b>--Eric Hoffer,</b><i><b> Between The Devil And The Dragon</b></i></p> 
<p>I tried the new in fall 2009,  teaching with student blogs, (look in 
sidebar and scroll down) out in the open where anyone who wanted to could see 
what the students were producing. The blogging wasn&rsquo;t new for me. 
I&rsquo;d been  doing that for almost five years. Having students blog was a 
different matter. I had no experience in getting them to overcome their 
anxieties, relaxing in writing online, learning to trust one another that way. 
Normally I believe what&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander. If I 
could blog comfortably and get something from that, so could they. On 
reflection, however, I was very gentle with myself when I started to blog. As 
an experiment to prove to myself whether I could do it, for three full weeks I 
made at least one post a day, 500 to 600 words, a couple of times 1,100 to 
1,200 words. I didn&rsquo;t tell a soul I was doing this. There was no pressure 
on me to keep it up. It was out in the open, yet nobody seemed to be watching. 
After those three weeks I felt ready. In the teaching, however, at best I could 
ask the students to blog once a week. I gave the students weekly prompts on the 
readings or to follow up on class discussion. (See the class calendar for fall 
2009. The prompts are in the Friday afternoon entries.) If I let them blog 
quietly to get comfortable as I had done, the entire semester would expire 
before they were ready to go public. There seemed no alternative but to have 
them plunge in.</p> 
<p>The uncertainty about how best to assist the students once they had taken 
the plunge created an important symmetry between the students and me; we both 
were to learn about how to do this well, often by first doing it less well. 
Though it was an inadvertent consequence, of all my teaching over the past 30 
years I believe this course came closest to emulating the <i>Seven Principles 
for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education</i> by Chickering and Gamson. I 
learned to comment on the student posts, not with some pre-thought-through 
response based on what I anticipated they&rsquo;d write, but rather to react to 
where they appeared to be in their own thinking. (This post provides a typical 
example. The student introduced time management as a theme. My comment aimed to 
make her think more about time management.) As natural as that is to do in 
ordinary conversation, I had never done it before when evaluating student work. 
Indeed, I didn&rsquo;t think of these comments as evaluation at all. I thought 
of them as response. In the normal course of my non-teaching work I respond to 
colleagues all the time and they respond to me. This form of online interaction 
in the class made it more like the rest of my interactions at work.</p> 
<p>Most of the students were quite awkward in their initial blogging. Good 
students all, the class was a seminar on &quot;Designing for Effective 
Change&quot; for the  Honors Program, but lacking experience in this sort of 
approach to instruction, the students wrote to their conception of what I 
wanted to hear from them. I can&rsquo;t imagine a more constipated mindset for 
producing interesting prose. For this class there was a need for them to 
unlearn much of their approach which had been finely tuned and was quite 
successful in their other classes. They needed to take more responsibility for 
their choices. While I gave them a prompt each week on which to write, I also 
gave them the freedom to choose their own topic so long as they could create a 
tie to the course themes. Upon reading much of the early writing, I admonished 
many of them to &quot;please themselves&quot; in the writing. I informed them 
that they could not possibly please other readers if they didn&rsquo;t first 
please themselves. It was a message they were not used to hearing. So it took a 
while for them to believe it was true. In several instances they tried it out 
only after being frustrating with the results from their usual approach. This, 
as Ken Bain teaches us, is how students learn on a fundamental level.</p> 
<p>I'm crustier now than I was as a younger faculty member. Nonetheless, I 
find it difficult to deal with the emotion that underlies giving feedback to 
students when that feedback is less than entirely complimentary to them. Yet 
given their awkward early attempts at writing posts that&rsquo;s exactly what 
honest response demanded. It&rsquo;s here where having the postings and the 
comments out in the open so all can see is so important, before the class has 
become a community, before the students have made up their minds about what 
they think about this blogging stuff. Though both the writing and the response 
are highly subjective, of necessity, it is equally  important for the process 
to be fair. How can a student who receives critical comments judge those 
comments to be fitting and appropriate, rather than an example of the 
insensitive instructor picking on the hapless student? Perhaps a very mature 
student can discern this even-handedly from the comments themselves and a 
self-critique of the original post. I believe most students benefit by reading 
the posts of their classmates, making their own judgments about those writings 
and then seeing the instructor&rsquo;s comments, finally making a subsequent 
determination as to whether those comments seem appropriate and helpful for the 
student in reconsidering the writing.</p> 
<p>A positive feedback loop can be created by this process. The commenting, 
more than any other activity the instructor engages in, demonstrates the 
instructor&rsquo;s commitment to the course and to the students. In turn the 
students, learning to appreciate the value of the comments, start to push 
themselves in the writing. Their learning is encouraged this way. Further, 
since the blogging is not a competition between the students and their 
classmates, those who like getting comments begin to comment on the posts of 
other students. The elements of the community that the class can become are 
found in this activity.</p> 
<p>Since on a daily basis I use blogs and blog readers in my regular work, one 
of the original reasons for me taking this approach rather than use the campus 
learning management system was simply that I thought it would be more 
convenient for me. Also, given my job as a learning technology administrator, I 
went into the course with some thought that I might showcase the work 
afterward. Openness is clearly better for that. However in retrospect neither 
of these is primary. The main reason to be open is to set a good tone for the 
class. We want ideas to emerge and not remain concealed.</p> 
<p>Yet there remains one troubling element: student privacy. Is open blogging 
this way consistent with  FERPA? As best as I&rsquo;ve been able to determine, 
it is as long as students &ldquo;opt in.&rdquo; (I did give students the 
alternatives of writing in the class LMS site or writing in the class wiki 
site. No student opted for those.) My experience suggests, however, that is not 
quite sufficient. If most students opt in, peer pressure may drive others to 
opt in as well. More importantly, however, students choose to opt in when they 
are largely ignorant of the consequences. Might they feel regret after they 
better understand what the blogging is all about?</p>

<p>Evaluation of ALN Programs at the University of North Texas</p> 
<p><b>On January 17, 2003, Ed Scribner forwarded this article from<i> The 
Dallas Morning News</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Students Who Live on Campus Choosing Internet Courses Syndicated From: 
<i>The Dallas Morning News</i></b></p> 
<p>DALLAS - Jennifer Pressly could have walked to a nearby lecture hall for 
her U.S. history class and sat among 125 students a few mornings a week.</p> 
<p>But the 19-year-old freshman at the University of North Texas preferred 
rolling out of bed and attending class in pajamas at her dorm-room desk. 
Sometimes she would wait until Saturday afternoon.</p> 
<p>The teen from Rockwall, Texas, took her first college history class online 
this fall semester. She never met her professor and knew only one of her 125 
classmates: her roommate.</p> 
<p>&quot;I take convenience over lectures,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I 
would be bored to death if I took it in lecture.&quot;</p> 
<p>She's part of a controversial trend that has surprised many university 
officials across the country. Given a choice, many traditional college students 
living on campus pick an online course. Most universities began offering 
courses via the Internet in the late 1990s to reach a different audience - 
older students who commute to campus and are juggling a job and family duties.
</p> 
<p>During the last year, UNT began offering an online option for six of its 
highest-enrollment courses that are typically taught in a lecture hall with 100 
to 500 students. The online classes, partly offered as a way to free up 
classroom space in the growing school, filled up before pre-registration ended, 
UNT officials said. At UNT, 2,877 of the about 23,000 undergraduates are taking 
at least one course online.</p> 
<p>Nationwide, colleges are reporting similar experiences, said Sally 
Johnstone, director of WCET, a Boulder, Colo., cooperative of state higher 
education boards and universities that researches distance education. Kansas 
State University, in a student survey last spring, discovered that 80 percent 
of its online students were full-time and 20 percent were part-time, the 
opposite of the college's expectations, Johnstone said.</p> 
<p>&quot;Why pretend these kids want to be in a class all the time? They 
don't, but kids don't come to campus to sit in their dorm rooms and do things 
online exclusively,&quot; she said. &quot;We're in a transition, and it's a 
complex one.&quot;</p> 
<p>(EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)</p> 
<p>The UT Telecampus, a part of the University of Texas System that serves 15 
universities and research facilities, began offering online undergraduate 
classes in state-required courses two years ago. Its studies show that 80 
percent of the 2,260 online students live on campus, and the rest commute.</p> 
<p>Because they are restricted to 30 students each, the UT System's online 
classes are touted as a more intimate alternative to lecture classes, said 
Darcy Hardy, director of the UT Telecampus.</p> 
<p>&quot;The freshman-sophomore students are extremely Internet-savvy and 
understand more about online options and availability than we could have ever 
imagined,&quot; Hardy said.</p> 
<p>Online education advocates say professors can reach students better online 
than in lecture classes because of the frequent use of e-mail and online 
discussion groups. Those who oppose the idea say they worry that undergraduates 
will miss out on the debate, depth and interaction of traditional classroom 
instruction.</p> 
<p>UNT, like most colleges, is still trying to figure out the effect on its 
budget. The professorial salary costs are the same, but an online course takes 
more money to develop. The online students, however, free up classroom space 
and eliminate the need for so many new buildings in growing universities. The 
price to enroll is typically the same for students, whether they go to a 
classroom or sit at their computer.</p> 
<p>Mike Campbell, a history professor at UNT for 36 years, does not want to 
teach an online class, nor does he approve of offering undergraduate history 
via the Internet.</p> 
<p>&quot;People shouldn't be sitting in the dorms doing this rather than 
walking over here,&quot; he said. &quot;That is based on a misunderstanding of 
what matters in history.&quot;</p> 
<p>In his class of 125, he asks students rhetorical questions they answer en 
masse to be sure they're paying attention, he said. He goes beyond the 
textbook, discussing such topics as the moral and legal issues surrounding 
slavery.</p> 
<p>He said he compares the online classes to the correspondence courses he 
hated but had to teach when he came to UNT in 1966. Both methods are too 
impersonal, he said, recalling how he mailed assignments and tests to 
correspondence students.</p> 
<p>UNT professors who teach online say the courses are interactive, unlike 
correspondence courses.</p> 
<p>Matt Pearcy has lectured 125 students for three hours at a time.</p> 
<p>&quot;You'd try to be entertaining,&quot; he said. &quot;You have students 
who get bored after 45 minutes, no matter what you're doing. They're filling 
out notes, doing their to-do list, reading their newspaper in front of

<p>In his online U.S. history class at UNT, students get two weeks to finish 
each lesson. They read text, complete click-and-drag exercises, like one that 
matches terms with historical figures, and take quizzes. They participate in 
online discussions and group projects, using e-mail to communicate.</p> 
<p>&quot;Hands-down, I believe this is a more effective way to teach,&quot; 
said Pearcy, who is based in St. Paul, Minn. &quot;In this setting, they go to 
the class when they're ready to learn. They're interacting, so they're paying 
attention.&quot;</p> 
<p>Pressly said she liked the hands-on work in the online class. She could do 
crossword puzzles to reinforce her history lessons. Or she could click an icon 
and see what Galileo saw through his telescope in the 17th century.</p> 
<p>&quot;I took more interest in this class than the other ones,&quot; she 
said.</p> 
<p>The class, though, required her to be more disciplined, she said, and that 
added stress. Two weeks in a row, she waited till 11:57 p.m. Sunday - three 
minutes before the deadline - to turn in her assignment.</p> 
<p>Online courses aren't for everybody.</p> 
<p>&quot;The thing about sitting in my dorm, there's so much to distract 
me,&quot; said Trevor Shive, a 20-year-old freshman at UNT. &quot;There's the 
Internet. There's TV. There's radio.&quot;</p> 
<p>He said students on campus should take classes in the real, not virtual, 
world.</p> 
<p>&quot;They've got legs; they can walk to class,&quot; he said.</p>

<p><strong><b>Evaluation of ALN Experiments at the New Jersey Institute of 
Technology</b></strong></p> 
<p>The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) also received a Sloan 
Foundation ALN grant and to date has conducted 26 courses as reported below by 
one of my students named Kattie Lawrence:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In 1998 NJIT was ranked nationally by <em>Money Magazine</em> as the 6th 
top value for science and technology universities. The school has 8,200 
students enrolled with 76 different available degrees. Like UIUC, NJIT&#146;s 
ALN program is being funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The University 
was given a grant to fund cyber classes, and the grant was extended in 1997 for 
an additional three years. NJIT&#146;s first experiments with ALN began in 
1986, and during its subsequent years of research NJIT has developed and 
trademarked its Virtual ClassroomTM program, a specially tailored form of 
educational computer conferencing. This program was used in combination with 
video in the creation of ALN courses. To date, there have been 26 courses 
developed which make use of Virtual ClassroomTM and video (whether that be 
pre-recorded lectures delivered to students on videotape, or via broadcast on a 
cable channel or satellite, or videos using standard television courses.) Both 
on campus students as well as distance students are able to take advantage of 
the Virtual ClassroomTM (VC) system, and enrollment has consisted of a mixture 
of student types. For distance learning, VC + video is used, while for on 
campus student VC is combined with face to face classes. VC is a tool that may 
be used to add an asynchronous element to classes, thus integrating this fairly 
new technological addition into courses.</p> 
<p>Virtual ClassroomTM has proven very successful at NJIT, as most ALN 
programs have across the world. The main focus of the ALN courses at NJIT is 
for the major courses needed for bachelor&#146;s degrees in Information Systems 
and Computer Science. The most recent ALN option available at NJIT is the 
addition of the on-line B.S. in Information Systems.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>NJIT's reviews of distance learning and ALN are given at

<p>New Jersey Institute of Technology has been delivering college courses via 
an Asynchronous<br>
 Learning Network (ALN) system called the Virtual 
Classroom[TM] for a decade, using various<br>
 media mixes. Currently, two 
complete undergraduate degree programs are available via a mix of<br>
 video 
plus Virtual Classroom, the B.A. in Information Systems and the B.S. in 
Computer Science.<br>
<br>
 This paper presents preliminary findings about 
impacts on students, and touches on some issues and potential impacts on 
faculty, individual universities, and the structure of higher education.<strong>
Overall ratings of courses by students who complete ALN based courses are equal 
or superior to those for traditional courses.</strong>&nbsp; Dropout or 
Incomplete outcomes are somewhat more prevalent, while<strong>grade 
distributions for those who complete tend to be similar</strong> to those for 
traditional courses. For both students and faculty, more startup time devoted 
to solving the &quot;logistics&quot; of ALN delivery seems to be required at 
the beginning of courses.<strong>ALN delivery is not just a 
&quot;different&quot; way of doing the same thing, however; it is likely to 
change the nature and structure of higher education.</strong></p> </blockquote> 
<p>NJIT offers complete degree programs via ACCESS/NJIT.&nbsp; These programs, 
however,&nbsp; rely heavily upon &quot;Tele-Lecture&quot; components 
distributed on videotapes that students study at their own time and place and 
replay as often as needed.&nbsp; There is also a The Computerized Conferencing

<p><strong><b>Evaluation of Audit Education in NYU's Virtual College</b>
</strong></p> 
<p>The Institute of Internal Auditors teamed up with New York University's 
Virtual College.&nbsp; One of the key problems of traditional classes that is 
overcome with virtual classes is discussed by the Director of Information 
Technologies (Richard Vigilante) as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Systems Auditing is characterized by two broad categories of knowledge: 
Declarative and procedural. Declarative knowledge represents the<i>concepts</i> 
of the field and is readily learned through traditional classroom lectures and 
discussions. Procedural knowledge represents the<i>process</i> inherent in the 
field and is best acquired through hands-on activities in collaborative teams 
of students simulating real analyses and audits.</p> 
<p>Faculty in our on-campus courses tried to get students to meet after class 
and to team up on group projects&#151;<strong>all to little avail.</strong> 
Faculty consistently recounted the students&#146; frustrating attempts to meet, 
only to have them spend more time agreeing on a meeting time than actually 
meeting. The result was that too often professors are forced to reduce key 
procedural concepts to declarative how-to lists.</p> 
<p>NYU&#146;s Virtual College was designed to address access problems facing 
its part-time auditing students and provide them with the same level of 
dynamic, hands-on instruction that characterizes the best on-campus course, 
laboratory, and faculty access available to full-time students. With 1.3 
million in grant support from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, NYU has developed 
and delivered online multimedia instruction in systems auditing to 
students&#146; PCs.</p> 
<p>In the new multimedia telecourses, digital videos contain faculty 
demonstrations, computer animation, and case study simulations to increase 
student mastery and retention of concepts, methodologies, and tools. The 
teleprogram&#146;s digital ISDN phone lines provide a 128 Kbps connection to 
the Virtual College servers, projecting the on-campus computer laboratory 
&quot;look and feel&quot; of sophisticated software applications directly to 
the students&#146; and faculty&#146;s PCs.</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong><b>Conclusion</b></strong></p> 
<h3>Does technology have no discernable impact on learning?<br>
<i>I've never 
been a disciple of technology. For me cell phones are multifunctional, 
multicolor devices that empower millions of us with little worth saying to 
interrupt other millions of us who ought to have something better to do. I 
don't want my car to talk to me, I don't want General Motors to know my 
latitude and longitude, and I don't need a pocket-size liquid crystal New York 
Times or instant access to thirty-second videos of skateboarding dogs , , , 
Many American students aren't doing all that well academically, and almost as 
many experts are peddling cures. Many prescribe computers as the miracle that 
will rescue our kids from scholastic mediocrity. That's why states like 
Michigan and Pennsylvania distributed laptops to thousands of students. Maine 
led the parade by handing out laptops to every seventh and eighth grader. 
Sponsors of the giveaways promised &quot;higher student performance.&quot; 
Unfortunately, the results have been disappointing. When the test results of 
Maine students showed no improvement, boosters explained that it would 
&quot;take more time for the impact of laptops to show up.&quot; 
Inconveniently, Maine's lackluster outcome only confirmed a rigorous 
international study of student computer use in thirty-one countries, which 
found that students who use computers at school &quot;perform sizably and 
statistically worse&quot; than students who don't. Analysts warned that when 
computer use replaces &quot;traditional learning methods,&quot; it 
&quot;actually harms the student.&quot; A review of California schools 
determined that Internet access had &quot;no measurable impact on student 
achievement.&quot; A 2007 federal study concluded that classroom use of reading 
and math software likewise yielded &quot;no significant differences&quot; in 
student performance.</i><br>

<p>Jensen Comment<br>
 Anecdotally technology can favorably impact learning. 
In my own case, it's had an enormous positive impact on my scholarship, my 
research, and my publishing. Number 1 are the communications and knowledge 
sharing (especially from listservs and blogs) --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/ListServRoles.htm </p> 
<p>Number 2 is the access to enormous databases and knowledge portals ---  
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Searchh.htm </p> 
<p>Number 3 is the tremendous increase in access provided by the campus 
libraries for scholars who take the time and effort to determine what is really 
there.</p> 
<p>Number 4 is open courseware. The open courseware (especially shared lecture 
materials and videos) from some of the best professors in our leading 
universities such as 1,500 courses served up by MIT and 177 science courses 
served up on YouTube by UC Berkeley are truly amazing. Critics of technology 
have probably never utilized these materials --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/updateee.htm#OKI </p> 
<p>I think Peter Berger overlooks some of the positive outcomes of technology 
on learning --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/Assess.htm#WhatWorks <br>
 More 
importantly look at the SCALE experiments at the University of Illinois --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#Illinois </p> 
<p>Although I always like Peter Berger's essays, this time he also overlooks 
much of the dark side of technology are learning --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/theworry.htm </p> 
<p>Technology and learning have much more complicated interactions that are 
superficially glossed over in this particular essay --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/0000start.htm </p> 
<p>Most &quot;vendor&quot; universities feel that networked courses should not 
be ported to curricula of other universities unless it becomes feasible to 
effectively and efficiently deal with the messaging and chat line monitoring 
given student tendencies toward high volumes of messaging in such courses. 
Hence, &quot;customer&quot; universities may discover that cost savings are not 
as great as expected if, and when, their programs seek to fill curricula gaps 
with the gold bridges of prestigious universities and businesses that offer 
networked courses.</p> 
<p>Virtually all analysts recognize the growth prospects of ALN courses 
networked under the categories of &quot;life long learning,&quot; &quot;adult 
education,&quot; &quot;continuing education,&quot; or &quot;continuous 
learning.&quot; Growth opportunities become more and more practical as digital 
television, wireless communication networks, and other technologies become 
common place around the world.<strong>Internet 2 </strong>will link campuses 
with enormous transmission capacities. Whereas on-campus traditional education 
has relatively flat growth prospects, the industry of network learning has 
immense and profitable growth opportunities. Furthermore, the need for 
&quot;customer&quot; universities to fill curricula gaps will fuel the fires of 
distributed education.</p> 
<p>But high quality network (distributed education) courses will be labor 
intensive in terms of dealing with student messaging and evaluation of student 
work. Faculty or equivalent experts must be online to evaluate student written 
and oral communications. Studies have shown that messaging explodes 
exponentially if asynchronous network courses are to maximize learning 
effectiveness. Whether or not the &quot;labor&quot; (faculty, graduate 
students, or hired guns) will be provided by the &quot;vendor&quot; (say MIT) 
or the &quot;customer&quot; (say Trinity University) is a matter of conjecture. 
Most likely, the cost of an imported ALN course will be less than cranking up a 
traditional or ALN course on campus. However, the cost of &quot;faculty&quot; 
will not be significantly reduced if the networked course is intended to 
maximize its potential with greatly increased communications beyond those found 
in a traditional course on campus.</p> 
<p>Hypermedia materials development costs are also very high. Vendors will 
probably seek high prices to help recover such costs. If respected universities 
contract with ALN vendors to bridge curriculum gaps, the online courses must be 
much more than text-based documents. The courses must use the latest networking 
technologies combined with CD databases to overcome bandwidth limitations of 
the Internet. Before long, DVD discs will replace the CDs and contain hours of 
full-screen, full-motion video to accompany server-controlled ALN courses.</p> 
<p>The concluding point is that by Year 2000 there will be a vast array of 
credit and non-credit ALN courses of very high quality. Many of these will be 
available from top universities and corporations around the world. <strong>
Traditional universities that cling to only limited, and possibly outmoded, 
courses will find themselves lost in a trail of Internet star dust.</strong> 
Strategies should be formed to bridge curriculum gaps with ALN contracts. This 
article stresses that ALN is not a cheap alternative in terms of faculty. Early 
experiments show that students will make more demands on faculty time using ALN 
that they did in traditional classroom pedagogy. However, students will learn 
more and communicate better if ALN is used properly with highest quality 
hypermedia materials and online communication links to faculty.</p>

<p><strong>Fostering Deeper Learning:&nbsp; Risks of Teaching More Than You 
Know</strong><br>
 (Copy of Selected Email Messages)</p> 
<p>As students commenced on their projects in <strong>ACCT 5341</strong> in 
Spring of 1998, I received the following email message:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Dr J,</p> 
<p>I am having problems with this project, as I am sure most of the class is, 
because I have done a lot of research (and could write a good research paper) 
but I have NO IDEA how to be creative in the measurement of risk. I keep 
thinking something will come to me, but so far it hasn&#146;t. I wish I could 
email you my topic today like we are supposed to, but I don&#146;t have one. I 
am worried because there is only a little over a month left, and I do not have 
a clue how to attack this paper. I have thought about writing a case involving 
the measurement of foreign currency risk, but right now I don&#146;t think I 
have enough understanding of it to determine if I could write a good case on 
it. Please understand that although this email is not quite what you wanted (ie 
I don&#146;t have a topic) I am trying to understand this project and produce 
something creative</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>After the course ended, I received the following is a comment by one of my 
graduate students on a course evaluation form where the student gave me the 
lowest possible rating:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Dr. Jensen is an effective facilitator but &#133; the topics were quite 
difficult conceptually, and I was taught more by other students and on my own.
</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Another gave me the lowest possible rating with the following comment:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Despite how much I disliked the course, I learned more than I expected. 
Definitely a necessary course!</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>A student (who gave me a high rating) may in subtle way be admitting that 
it is difficult for students to take responsibility for their own learning in 
ambiguous environments:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes, we could have used more explanations at times. First few weeks of 
class we all wondered what we were talking about.</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>This graduate class grumbled all the time about the ambiguities and work 
loads of<strong>ACCT 5342</strong> in the Fall and <strong>ACCT 5341</strong> 
in the Spring. Students had high anxieties about doing research.&nbsp; But the 
projects that constituted over 50% of the grade in both courses are among the 
best projects that I have ever encountered in 33 years of teaching (mostly 
graduate students) in four universities. Students cursed under their breath 
during their many hours of discovery learning, but their work will be an 
inspiration to accounting theory educators and students for years to come. Fall 
Semester projects are relational databases that cannot be made available at 
this point in time. However, financial instruments derivatives projects from 
Spring Semester can be viewed and/or downloaded by<strong>clicking here</strong>
.</p> 
<p>My students proposed innovative solutions to problems that international 
accounting standard setters have not been able to resolve for years. This was a 
great class in terms of ultimate performance of nearly all of the students.</p> 
<p>One problem about making students take responsibility for their own 
learning is that it seems so foreign to them and requires a lot of more 
sweat!&nbsp; But if the ultimate rewards are immense, what is wrong with 
ambiguity and discovery learning? Huge problems center upon risks to the 
instructor. If I wasn't 60 years old and fully tenured, I would probably be 
forced to go back to spoon feeding and wiping up memorized regurgitation of 
answer book solutions to CPA Examination problems. This would certainly be an 
easier out for me and make me better loved by students facing tough CPA 
Examinations after graduation. It would also make it easier to meter their 
grades every week during the semester, which is something they seem to be very 
keen on.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What is good about students taking responsibility for their own learning? 
Probably the best thing that can be said for it is that it prepares students 
for the ambiguities of life after graduation day. One thing that really does 
please me is that one student in particular had troubles with regurgitation 
examinations during her entire five years at Trinity University (including some 
tough examinations that she scored low on in other courses this year). In my 
courses she soared like an eagle, because she loved research (probably to a 
fault from the standpoint of her time) and did outstanding work for me. At the 
other extreme, one of the top g.p.a. regurgitators in the class can memorize 
anything and received the highest average in some of her other courses. She 
submitted the worst project in my course and received the lowest grade that I 
gave all year.</p> 
<p>Which of these two students is best prepared for life? </p> 
<p>As for me ---<b> I taught them more than I know! </b>Makes me the meanest 
sob in the valley.</p>

<p>Blystone's &quot;interesting use of semantics&quot; is one of my pet 
topics. I am liable to go on a major rant when I hear a student complain that 
&quot;he's not a good teacher.&quot; That's not his job. He's a professor, not 
a teacher. His job is to gain as much knowledge as possible in his field and 
profess that knowledge to the students. He is not trained to teach (how many 
hours do education students spend learning teaching techniques compared with 
the in-at-the-deep-end TA experience of most university faculty).</p> 
<p>Any teaching he might do, in the sense of helping the students learn, is 
above and beyond the call of duty (although we all know that if he doesn't 
&quot;teach&quot; there will be reprimands from the administration and no 
promotions or raises to say nothing of the fact that the vast majority really 
want to help their students learn as evidenced by so many of the postings on 
this list).</p> 
<p>A professor is a source of information. It is up to the student to learn as 
much as possible from that source. Based on Blystones's &quot;interesting use 
of semantics&quot; the main difference between</p> 
<p>high school and college is who has the major responsibility for effecting 
the transfer of knowledge: the teacher or the student.</p>

<p>Dr. Hertel&#146;s reply is reproduced below:</p> 
<p>Bob Jensen&#146;s intuitions about transfer of training into the real world 
are supported by findings in cognitive psychology. What he calls 
&quot;discovery learning&quot; (assuming that it is followed up by 
&quot;corrections&quot; or &quot;feedback&quot;) transfers much better than 
does memory-oriented training (Needham and Begg, 1991, in a journal entitled 
Memory &amp; Cognition). We also have evidence that the learner tends to 
perceive the opposite direction of the difference between the two. Anybody 
interested can check out a chapter by<strong>Robert Bjork</strong> in a 1992 
(?) volume by<strong> Metcalf and Shimamura</strong> call Metacognition.</p>

<p>http://www.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/ecowww/fost.html (Fostering Deeper 
Learning)&nbsp; In this document, Carol Johnston in the Economics Department at 
the University of Melbourne states the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>All teachers bring to the classroom or lecture theatre an inbuilt informal 
theory of teaching. This theory, which may be either consciously stated or 
implicit in what the teachers do, has implications for the way in which 
students learn. Fox (1983) asked newly appointed polytechnic teachers what they 
meant by 'teaching'. As a result he identified four basic theories underlying 
the approaches to teaching of polytechnic staff. First, the transfer theory, in 
which the subject matter is viewed as a commodity that can be transferred into 
an empty vessel waiting to receive it, ie. the student's mind. If certain 
students do not learn, despite the fact that the commodity has been 
transferred, it is because the vessel in this case is a leaky one. This amounts 
to the view that it is the student's fault if they do not learn. Where teaching 
materials are well prepared, effectively organised, and imparted, teachers are 
considered to have done all they can.<br>
<br>
 A second theory relates to the 
'shaping' of the students mind into some predetermined form. This view sits 
easily with the notion of teaching as training rather than educating. Teachers, 
with this informal theory, use verbs such as 'develop' and 'produce' to 
describe the student learning outcomes of their teaching. Fox classifies these 
two theories of teaching as 'simple' theories which are more likely to be held 
by the less experienced or non-reflective teacher. Here there is a simple 
relationship between teaching and learning. If a topic has been taught it must 
therefore have been learnt. An essential feature of these two theories is that 
it is the teacher who is in control of the commodity to be transferred and who 
determines the shape of the finished product.<br>
<br>
 The third type of 
theory, a 'developed' theory is one which takes the view that the student and 
teacher are undertaking a journey of discovery together. This is the notion of 
the 'shared adventure' that Baird (1992) develops in his exploration of science 
teaching in Victorian secondary schools. The teacher's role according to this 
'travelling' theory is to act as a knowledgeable and experienced guide and 
fellow explorer in the journey of education. Here a range of perspectives are 
explored, there is no 'right' body of knowledge to be learnt and the 
expectation is that the teacher will learn along with the students. Svensson 
and Hogfors (1988) extended this view in their work with engineering students 
where they concluded that encouraging students to consider a variety of 
alternative conceptions is an important element in bringing about lasting 
conceptual change in the learner.</p> 
<p><strong>The growing theory, the final type identified by Fox, is also a 
developed theory in the sense that students make a significant contribution to 
their own learning in terms of its pace, direction, objectives and process. The 
growing theory takes into account the past experiences, learning and knowledge 
of the student. It is flexible in its outcomes both in terms of the overall 
direction and the extent or level of that outcome. In travelling and growing 
developed theories the teacher's role has changed from being an infallible 
expert responsible for a final product to being a guide who is more responsive 
to the context in which the learning is occurring.</strong></p> </blockquote>

<p><b>2008 SURVEY OF ONLINE EDUCATION IN THE U.S. </b> </p> 
<p>&quot;Staying the Course: Online Education in the United States, 2008&quot; 
by I. Elaine Allen and Jeff Seaman, is the sixth in a series of annual reports 
on a study conducted by the Babson Survey Research Group for the Sloan 
Consortium. Using responses from over 2,500 colleges and universities, the 
study sought answers to several questions on online education:</p> 
<p>-- How many students are learning online? </p> 
<p>-- What is the impact of the economy on online enrollments? </p> 
<p>-- Is online learning strategic? </p> 
<p>-- What disciplines are best represented online? </p>

<p>The Sloan Consortium (Sloan-C) is a consortium of institutions and 
organizations committed &quot;to help learning organizations continually 
improve quality, scale, and breadth of their online programs according to their 
own distinctive missions, so that education will become a part of everyday 
life, accessible and affordable for anyone, anywhere, at any time, in a wide 
variety of disciplines.&quot; Sloan-C is funded by the Alfred P. Sloan 
Foundation. For more information, go to http://www.sloan-c.org/</p>

<p><b>STUDY OF ASYNCHRONOUS AND SYNCHRONOUS E-LEARNING METHODS </b></p> 
<p>&quot;The debate about the benefits and limitations of asynchronous and 
synchronous e-learning seems to have left the initial stage, in which 
researchers tried to determine the medium that works 'better' -- such studies 
generally yielded no significant differences. Consequently, instead of trying 
to determine the best medium, the e-learning community needs an understanding 
of when, why, and how to use different types of e-learning.&quot;</p> 
<p>In &quot;Asynchronous and Synchronous E-Learning&quot; (EDUCAUSE QUARTERLY, 
vol. 31, no. 4, October&ndash;December 2008), Stefan Hrastinski writes on the 
&quot;benefits and limitations of asynchronous and synchronous 
e-learning.&quot; He provides useful tables comparing the two to help 
instructors understand when, why, and how to use these delivery modes.</p>

<p><b>&quot;ACADEMIA.EDU&quot; NETWORKING SITE </b></p> 
<p>Earlier this fall, a team of people from Oxford, Stanford, and Cambridge 
Universities launched the website, Academia.edu, which does two things:</p> 
<p>-- It shows academics around the world structured in a &quot;tree&quot; 
format, displayed according to their departmental and institutional 
affiliations.</p> 
<p>-- It enables academics to see news in their area of research. </p> 
<p>The site's founders are hoping that Academia.edu will eventually list every 
academic in the world, including faculty members, post-docs, graduate students, 
and independent researchers. People can add their departments and themselves to 
the tree. Individual entries can list the academic's research interests, papers 
and books, websites, talks, courses taught, and CVs.</p>

<p><strong>An Online Course From the Harvard Law School</strong></p> 
<p>Some leading universities are commencing to experiment with online courses 
available to the general public. The following email message discusses an 
experimental online course from the Harvard Law School:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School is 
offering a new experimental online course open to the public. Professor William 
W. Fisher will moderate the cybercourse on &quot;Intellectual Property in 
Cyberspace.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fisher, an expert in copyright, patent, and trademark law, says the course 
will &quot;address the controversial and volatile question of who should own 
what on the Internet.&quot; Among the topics the course will consider are: How 
should Internet domain names be assigned? Should creators of material posted on 
the Net be able to object when their creations are mangled or misrepresented? 
How should the law deal with situations in which multiple authors contribute to 
the creation of material on the Net? Should Internet service providers be 
liable for copyright infringement when they unwittingly carry copyrighted 
materials without the permission of their owners?</p> 
<p>Fisher and a team of Harvard Law School Teaching Fellows have developed six 
week-long modules designed to expose students to the latest court decisions, 
legislation and scholarship on intellectual property issues raised by the 
emergence of the Internet. Students will present and refine their own views on 
these issues by participating online in a variety of virtual seminars and 
threaded conferences. The course is the second in a series of online courses to 
be offered by the Berkman Center, and has been made possible by a donation from 
the Boston law firm of Hale and Dorr LLP.</p> 
<p>&quot;The course is part of our ongoing effort to learn more about how the 
Internet can best facilitate distance learning and community-building, and how 
Internet teaching techniques can substantively augment more traditional 
pedagogy,&quot; says Professor Charles Nesson, Director of the Berkman Center. 
Jonathan Zittrain, Executive Director of the Center, adds, &quot;As 
pragmatists, we want to find out which software and hardware tools are likely 
to make teaching easier and more powerful, not more time-consuming and 
frustrating.&quot;</p> 
<p>The course is free and open to the public, but the total number of 
registrants is limited. No credits or certificates will be offered. The course 
is not part of the Harvard Law School academic curriculum, and phone inquiries 
should not be directed to the Law School registrar's office; rather, more 
information can be found on the Berkman Center web site,<b>
http://cyber.harvard.edu</b>, or the course web site at 
http://property.berkmancenter.org. Registration begins on March 25 and the 
course will last until the middle of May.</p> 
<p>The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School charts, 
and in some ways attempts to shape, the explosive development of the globally 
networked environment (a.k.a. cyberspace). The Center's philosophy is that in 
order to understand this new environment one must actually build out into it, a 
form of self-active study.</p>

<p>Online Biology: Email Message From Brad Stith</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>From: Brad Stith &lt;bstith@carbon.cudenver.edu<br>
 Subject: online courses
</p> 
<p>Sender: owner-cur-l@mcs.anl.gov</p> 
<p>Our Biology department held a meeting to discuss our participation in the 
&quot;Online course&quot; program (a program that, over the past few years, has 
grown to involve over 1000 students per semester). I would like to summarize 
the meeting and ask for input from CUR members</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Main points:</p> 
<p>1. three teachers (biology of cancer, cell biology, genetics; see</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>http://www.cuonline.edu) believe that Online teaching was as rigorous as 
their in-classroom lecture course (although one teacher had only 3 min of audio 
per week, the teachers did not feel that they had to use &quot;sound 
bites&quot; or &quot;dumb down&quot; the course to conform to the online method 
of presentation). One teacher had both a lecture class and an online class and 
found that the students in the online class performed as good or better on the 
same exams.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>2. although the initial start up cost is significant, an online course 
offers the potential</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>for large profit for the university. At present, our online course 
instructors are often not tenure-track and are paid very little per course (and 
the university does not have to provide classroom, etc.). This may mean that 
students will not even appear on campus (will they prefer online courses to 
lecture classes?), the role of faculty and the structure of departments will be 
redefined (one of our future instructors is located half-way across the 
country). In the opinion of one teaching advisor (obtained after the meeting), 
the online courses &quot;will not end&quot; lectures as we know them, but is 
merely another tool.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>3. the updating of an online course requires a significant amount of time 
yet there is</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>no money to support this maintenance (there is extra start up money 
available). In a subsequent conversation with experienced online teachers, the 
belief was that there was more &quot;one on one&quot; interaction between 
teacher and student (usually by email) and that larger classes literally 
&quot;max-out&quot; the teacher&#146;s time. Biology is currently limiting 
online enrollment to about 22-24 students.</p> 
<p>The present system requires that the online teacher scan in all images on 
their own and forward these images and text files to the online administrators. 
There were still many technical problems and concerns. Concerns: confusion in 
operating procedures, and that one cannot tell who is still in the class.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>4. The chat room was not successful in the experience of the teachers. If 
more</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>than a few people were involved, the conversation became difficult to 
follow and lead. Large courses of 50 to 300 students may not be able to utilize 
this method of communicating with students. Posting of threaded discussions 
(email) were found to be valuable.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>5. As active learning (students working in lecture halls in groups to answer
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>questions raised during lecture) is currently emphasized yet online 
learning often means that the student is sitting alone going through written 
material. In a subsequent discussion, one online teacher requires that students 
work in teams.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>6. The online method requires the teacher to place what is essentially 
their own</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;textbook&quot; online. One advantage of online teaching would be that 
if a student needed to review basic material for earlier required courses, the 
teacher could put in a &quot;click here for background info...&quot; This would 
require immense effort and the course would (like lecture courses) be developed 
or improved over a period of years.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>The Amazing Way Children Can Organize to Teach Each Other</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Jaw-dropping: a talk about &quot;lightweight learning,&quot; by 
Sugata Mitra at Google's London office, Schmoller, November 2009 ---<br>
 
http://fm.schmoller.net/2009/10/jawdropping-a-talk-by-sugata-mitra-at-googles-london-office.html
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Sugata is  Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle University and 
he will be one of the three keynote speakers at the2010 ALT Conference between 
7 and 9 September 2010.&nbsp; [Disclosure - I work for ALT part time.] Since 
the late 1990s Sugata Mitra he has been running empirical experiments to see 
what happens when children are able to use an Internet connected PC, usually in 
a public space, and always on the basis of several sharing the PC, usually in 
groups involving a wide age range. Most but not all of his experiments have 
been in areas of poverty, with much of the research having taken place in 
impoverished areas of India.</p> 
<p>Here are some of Sugata's findings, some of which are covered in  Remote 
Presence: Technologies for &lsquo;Beaming&rsquo; Teachers Where They Cannot Go, 
from the August 2009 issue of the Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web 
Intelligence [680 kB PDF], as well as in the 2007 TED talk at the foot of this 
piece. What follows is a lightly and probably too quickly cleaned up version of 
the notes I took during Sugata's talk.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Groups of children can learn to use computers and the Internet, without 
the support of adults. </li> 
<li>Over 300 children can become computer literate in 3 months with 1 public 
access computer.</li> 
<li>The computer needs to be in a safe public place that the children 
associate with safety, free time, and play.</li> 
<li>Children will self-organise their learning. Mitra &quot;does not know how 
this happens&quot;.</li> 
<li>Alongside becoming computer literate, the children improve their maths and 
english, improve their social values, get better at collaborating, improve 
their school attendance, reduce their drop out rates.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Depending on how the computer is set up, and the software and content it 
has, Mitra has observed and tested children doing various things including 
teaching themselves functional English, algebra, biotechnology, and improving 
their pronunciation of English.</li> </ol> 
<p>These results are replicable, in many different parts of the world where 
&quot;hole in the wall&quot; experiments have been carried out; and such 
&quot;learning stations&quot; can be provided in countries like India at an all 
in cost of around 0.03USD per child per day.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some readers will be asking themselves <em>&quot;is this relevant to 
education in countries like the UK?&quot;</em>. Yes, according to Sugata, 
describing a February 2008 experiment he conducted in Gateshead, in the North 
East of England, where ten year old children (who each had a laptop, but who 
seemed not to be benefiting) were put in groups of four, with one laptop per 
group, and with ground rules encouraging them to reach consensus and to listen 
out for progress on neighbouring tables, and to claim it as their own. (Sugata 
quipped &quot;that is how scientific research works...&quot;)&nbsp; In 20 
minutes (45 for the slowest) the children had solved several questions from the 
GCSE chemistry examination (normally taken by a minority learners of 16),&nbsp; 
by collaborative learning using Google, Wikipedia, Ask Jeeves, Ask, Answerbag, 
etc.</p> 
<p>Tests of these children several months later showed that their learning 
(but their understanding?) was retained. Why? According to Sugata, having to 
learn collaboratively and to reach consensus is the key to the success of this 
approach.&nbsp; </p> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<h3>Appendix 3</h3> 
<p>Onsite versus Online Universities in the 21st Century</p> 
<p><b>Is the University of Phoenix really better positioned for the 21st 
Century than &quot;many non-elite, especially private, traditional academic 
institutions?&quot;</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Remaking the Academy&quot;, by Jorge Klor de Alva, <i>Educause Review
</i>, March/April 2000, pp. 21-40.<br>
 &nbsp;
http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/erm0023.pdf&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As education moves toward the certification of competence with a focus on 
demonstrated skills and knowledge&mdash; that is, on &ldquo;what you 
know&rdquo; rather than on &ldquo;what you have taken&rdquo; in 
school&mdash;more associations and organizations that can prove themselves 
worthy to the U.S. Education Department will likely be able to gain 
accreditation. This increased competition worldwide&mdash;from, for instance, 
corporate universities, training companies, course content aggregators, and 
publisher media conglomerates&mdash;will put a premium on the ability of 
institutions not only to provide quality education but to do so on a continuous 
and highly distributed basis and with convenient access for those seeking 
information, testing, and certification. In short, as education becomes a 
continuous process of certification&mdash;that is, a lifelong process of 
earning certificates attesting to the accumulation of new skills and 
competencies&mdash;institutional success for any higher education enterprise 
will depend more on successful marketing, solid quality assurance and control 
systems, and effective use of the new media than on production and 
communication of knowledge. T<b>his is a shift that I believe University of 
Phoenix is well positioned to undertake, but I am less confident that many 
non-elite, especially private, traditional academic institutions will manage to 
survive successfully.</b></p> 
<p>That glum conclusion leads me to a final observation: societies everywhere 
expect from higher education institutions the provision of an education that 
can permit them to flourish in the changing global economic landscape. Those 
institutions that can continually change, keeping up with the needs of the 
transforming economy they serve, will survive. Those that cannot or will not 
change will become irrelevant, will condemn misled masses to second class 
economic status or poverty, and will ultimately die, probably at the hands of 
those they chose to delude by serving up an education for a nonexistent world.

<p><b>I don't think Jeoge Klor de Alva and I agree on the roles of what I 
called Type 2 (onsite) versus Type 1 (online) universities in the 21st  Century.
</b>&nbsp; I wrote the following in the April 4, 2000 edition of New Bookmarks 
athttp://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/book00q2.htm#EducationIntangibles</p> 
<p><b>Education Intangibles:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 Will accountants &quot;rule the 
world&quot; of the future of educational institutions?</b></p> 
<p>I was challenged by the recent TigerTalk exchanges on the emerging 
dominance of economics and accounting in higher education.&nbsp; Although I 
still have hundreds of unopened email messages, I did encounter messages from 
Dr. Spinks (English) and Dr. Meyer (Director of Trinity University's Library)
</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, I agree that accountants should never &quot;rule the 
world.&quot;&nbsp; Actually business firms and educational institutions have 
much more in common than non-accountants tend to realize.&nbsp; The race of Ivy 
League institutions to capitalize on their logos by partnering with 
corporations like UNext and Pensare is only the tip of the iceberg in this age 
of technology.&nbsp; But the value of their logos and other assets cannot be 
realistically accounted for due to the many intangibles that defy 
accounting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you aggregate all the prices of all the shares of companies traded in 
the world markets, the tangible assets that accountants account for on balance 
sheets tally up to only 17% of business &quot;value.&quot;&nbsp; The other 83% 
is comprised of intangible assets (largely a business firm's human resources, 
intellectual capital, organizational synergy, name recognition, goodwill, 
leadership, and R&amp;D) that we do a miserable job of accounting for in 
business firms. In not-for-profit organizations, and especially educational 
institutions, accountants perform&nbsp; even worse, because the proportion of 
intangible assets is even higher in those institutions.&nbsp; Anyone interested 
in problems of accounting for intangibles should take a look at
http://www.fastcompany.com/online/31/lev.html&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The problem with curriculum design is that it tries to turn intangibles 
into tangibles.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the term &quot;Western Culture&quot; 
is intangible and ambiguous. Adding specific courses with specific content to 
the &quot;Western Culture Curriculum&quot; is in some sense an attempt to 
&quot;account for&quot; what qualifies as tangible learning of an intangible 
topic.&nbsp; In spite of our efforts to declare these &quot;tangible&quot; 
curriculum requirements, intangibles in the curriculum and other areas of 
living and learning dominate as much or more as intangibles dominate in 
business firm valuation.&nbsp; In this context, curriculum design is a form of 
accounting for intangibles that becomes more and more hopeless as we attempt to 
turn intangibles into tangibles.</p> 
<p>I think we give Trinity University students the full measure of what they 
bargained for even if they don't realize all they bargained for when they first 
appear on campus. The curriculum is only a part, albeit vital part, of living 
and learning while they are here. It is generally the most stressful aspect of 
college life, because satisfying the curriculum is where students discover that 
there is so much to be learned, and so little time in which to learn, from 
faculty with integrity and standards for demonstrating that learning takes 
place at equal or higher levels relative to our own peer competitors.To do 
anything less would be the real &quot;bait and switch,&quot; because if the 
curriculum becomes too easy or irrelevant in changing times, then respect for a 
Trinity degree plunges.</p> 
<p>The point here is that if you base predictions on 17% or less of the 
&quot;total&quot; data, then you hardly stand on sound footing for making 
predictions. One of the main problems accountants have in dealing with 
intangibles is that, relative to tangible assets, intangible assets are very 
fragile. Today you have them, but tomorrow they may disappear without even 
being stolen in a legal sense. For example, I suspect that Bill Gates is far 
less concerned about the anti-trust lawsuit than he is about emerging signs of 
inability of Microsoft's &quot;intangibles&quot; to prosper in a networked 
world of e-Commerce, ubiquitous computing, and wireless technologies.&nbsp; 
Virtually all universities have been shocked by the paradigm shift in distance 
learning and are now worried about whether their &quot;intangibles&quot; can 
prosper in the new &quot;McLearn&quot; paradigm.</p> 
<p>Having said this, I think that there will be two types of higher education 
institutions in the future.&nbsp; Type 1 will be run like a business whether it 
is a corporation or a traditional university with web training and education 
programs.&nbsp; This is what I will call a McLearn online university.&nbsp; 
Type 2 is a traditional onsite university brimming with more intangibles.</p> 
<p>McLearn online universities (or traditional universities operating like 
businesses) will provide certificate and degree programs from anywhere in the 
world. They will be very efficient and reasonably effective for topical 
coverage. The world will flock to them just as the world flocks to fast food 
restaurants for convenience, price, efficiency, and sometimes a craving for the 
food itself (e.g. a taco salad or a milk shake) that just seems right for the 
time. They may also have nutritious items on the menu. See Maitre d'Igital's 
cafe athttp://www.technos.net/.&nbsp; In the same context, McLearn's online 
knowledge bases will proliferate and become spectacular due to the billions of 
dollars that will be available for building such knowledge bases.</p> 
<p>Business is not an evil thing per se.&nbsp; Outstanding research takes 
place in the private sector as well as the public sector. Outstanding 
performances (music, theatre, film, etc.) take place in the private sector as 
well as the public sector. Even though we view Hollywood as blatantly 
commercial, some of our finest works of art have appeared in commercial films. 
The power of films and television to impact upon culture is both magnificent 
and scary.&nbsp; On the magnificent side, do you think there ever has been 
anything more powerful than Hollywood in fighting bigotry in the hearts and 
minds of succeeding generations following the Civil War?&nbsp; The same will be 
said, ultimately, for global and life-long learning in McLearn online 
universities.&nbsp; In fact, for certain types of learning there is little 
doubt that corporations can and are doing a better job than the public sector 
(e.g., the success of Motorola University in delivering technical engineering 
training and education to the Far East.&nbsp; Seehttp://mu.motorola.com/.)</p> 
<p>Be that as it may, McLearn online universities will have a difficult time 
putting together a cost-effective total education menu that competes with Type 
2 onsite universities like Trinity University. This is largely due to 
intangibles that lie outside the grasp of McLearn online curriculum.&nbsp; It 
happens that some of our best Type 2 onsite students are also varsity athletes, 
musicians, actors, etc. Athletic competition and artistic performances are part 
and parcel to living and learning for many students.&nbsp; McLearn universities 
may have online debates and chess competitions, but these will never take the 
place of the roar of the fans, slapping your buddy on the butt with a wet 
towel, getting chewed out by a tempered coach, having your boyfriend or 
girlfriend in the audience even if you only have a bit part in a performance, 
etc.&nbsp; McLearn online university will probably never find a way of making a 
bottom-line profit on building and running a chapel, having faculty that 
students consider friends as well as teachers, and having students learn about 
what real life is all about with loves gained and lost, living in rumor mills, 
enduring insults, helping someone who has lost the way, and learning to deal 
with greater diversities in life styles, and cultures.</p> 
<p>Accountants will not rule the world at large. And curriculum designers will 
not rule the university at large.We are only bit players in immense productions 
in Type 2 onsite universities.&nbsp;And we may need some of those cursed 
marketing metaphors that indicate how living and learning universities differ 
from learning universities.&nbsp; Providing a student with a chapel, a theatre, 
a concert hall, a playing field, a dormitory, and a geology professor named 
Glenn Kroeger can all be described as a &quot;service&quot; in a broad 
sense.&nbsp; Students are our &quot;clients&quot; in a very broad sense.&nbsp; 
But neither our &quot;service&quot; nor our &quot;clients&quot; constitute very 
good business in an accounting sense, because more than 83% of the value of our 
service to clients is intangible and subject to circumstances outside our 
control.&nbsp; Serendipity rules supreme in a Type 2 onsite 
education.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no accounting for serendipity.&nbsp; What we do 
best is to create an environment where serendipity has more opportunity.&nbsp; 
Perhaps this is one of the main distinctions between training and 
education.&nbsp;In this context, curriculum design is necessary to a point but 
should never become too structured or too specific as a &quot;tangible&quot; 
asset in either the online or the onsite universities.</p>

(other than in a physical sense as an energy quotient) is still metaphoric and 
as hard to define as &quot;service&quot; and equally in need of clarification 
of its hidden assumptions.</p> 
<p>If accountants rule the world, I am sure &quot;bottom-line&quot; is a 
primary<b>value</b>, and if these economic theorists (not all are efficiency 
readers), then I am sure efficiency is the primary value, but neither set of 
rules is privileged to the point of disallowing discussion of the consequences 
of the rules.</p> 
<p>I surely will be caught in one of these verbal spins as my own gaminess 
collapses, but I don't think so yet.</p>

<h2>Appendix 5 </h2> 
<h2>PublicPolicy Implications and the Digital Future</h2> 
<p>In November 1997, Educom sponsored a conference that is reported at 
http://www.educom.edu/program/nlii/keydocs/policy.html</p> 
<p>There are many public policy implications of networked learning and other 
emerging technologies.&nbsp; One of these is the &quot;Digital Future&quot; 
quoted below:</p> 
<p><strong>Digital Future</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Society's higher education requirements are undergoing a fundamental 
transformation. A rapidly growing student population is becoming older and 
increasingly diverse. In addition, the new economy requires a workforce capable 
of handling an exploding knowledge base. Industries are looking to higher 
education institutions to provide the necessary education and training. There 
is financial pressure too: colleges and universities must control and even 
reduce costs, as well as manage new competitive dynamics, while responding to 
growing demands. On their own, each of these factors is significant; 
collectively they challenge fundamental higher education strategies and 
practices as we approach the 21st century.<br>
<br>
 Emerging digital 
technology, especially the Internet, is ideally suited to meet the new learning 
needs.&nbsp; What follows is a set of assumptions about the digital future:<br>

<br> <strong>The communications, computing, and information industries are 
converging in the digital environment.</strong>This environment will include a 
convergence of sound, video, and data with synchronous and asynchronous 
communication. Digital technology will continue its rapid ascent as analog 
technologies continue to decline. The Internet is predicted to grow: 
conservative estimates put the number of today's Internet users at around 50 
million; predictions are for over 1 billion users before the end of the decade. 
An expansion in bandwidth, expected to see the most revolutionary change in the 
next decade, will allow such things as the delivery of multimedia directly to 
the home.<br>
<br>
<strong>The rate at which new technologies are penetrating 
business and the home can be expected to increase.</strong>&nbsp; Increasingly, 
we are experiencing the permeation of new technologies and network use 
throughout society. Proficiency in using technology is now for all practical 
purposes a required competency in the workforce; it is becoming another basic 
skill. Currently, 65 percent of all workers use some type of information 
technology in their jobs. This will increase to 95 percent by the year 2000. 
Entering students arrive on campus &quot;network savvy&quot; and graduates move 
into a world increasingly reliant on networked communications.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Networks and networked information will lead to disintermediation, 
disaggregation, diffusion, and differentiation.</strong>&nbsp; Computer 
networks offer the possibility of disintermediation -- that is, when the 
consumer can access services and information directly rather than going through 
an intermediary. All of our modern technologies with rapid diffusion rates -- 
high consumer acceptance -- have been personal and disintermediated. Technology 
drives us toward disaggregation, information products and services being broken 
apart and repackaged to cater to consumer's desires, which in turn enables mass 
customization. It also enables differentiation; products and services can be 
combined and used in different ways for more than one purpose to meet different 
needs.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Impact on Higher Education</strong><br>
<br>
 A 
learning infrastructure based on digital technology offers more than just 
education as usual on the Internet. It offers a set of extraordinary new tools: 
self-paced, multimedia modules that deliver leading pedagogy; in-depth outcome 
assessments; and online interaction with fellow students and teachers that 
facilitates continuous feedback and improvement. The following describes some 
of what the digital future holds in store for higher education:<br>
<br>

<strong>Disaggregation unbundles the instructional process.</strong>&nbsp; 
Technology enables us to disaggregate the place, the content, the delivery, and 
judgments about the quality of education. By separating instruction from 
assessment, teaching from degree granting, content development from content<br>

 delivery, and even service from compliance on the part of the government, 
traditional roles are redefined and new ones emerge.<br>
<br>
<strong>The 
Internet expands learning opportunities.</strong>&nbsp; Distance learning 
technologies, such as the Internet, and to a lesser extent, cable and 
satellite-based systems, enables learners to access education whenever and 
wherever they want. Online experiences offer educational opportunities to 
millions of learners previously constrained by time, location, and other 
factors.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Internet enhances choice and challenges 
regulation.</strong>&nbsp; The Internet lowers the threshold of entry to the 
higher education marketplace for new commercial and nonprofit educational 
providers by eliminating many barriers. The development of ever more effective 
electronic modes of delivering education at a distance and the explosive growth 
of networks will continue to erode the geographic hegemony of higher education 
and continue to challenge current state regulatory mechanisms. Students will be 
more likely to select educational institutions based on offerings, convenience, 
and price than on geography.<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactive multimedia and other 
technologies will change how we think about providers and whom we regard as 
providers.</strong>Learning resources that were once only available through 
education institutions will appear in retail stores in the form of multimedia 
software and other computer-based courseware. Consumers will be able to 
purchase learning products independently and learn at their convenience, 
collectively spending millions of dollars on education each year. This 
purchasing power will have a tremendous impact on who controls learning.<br>

<br> <strong>Education will no longer take place within the silos of individual 
institutions (or even their virtual equivalents).</strong>Instead education 
will occur within a dynamic global marketplace of customers and suppliers. With 
its emphasis on creativity and competition, this marketplace will enable a wide 
range of players -- universities, media, publishers, content specialists, 
technology companies -- to market, sell, and deliver educational services 
online.<br>
<br>
<strong>A New Vision: A Global Learning Infrastructure</strong>
<br> <br>
 We envisage a global learning infrastructure -- a student-centric, 
virtual, global web of educational services -- as the foundation for achieving 
society's learning goals. This contrasts with the bricks-and-mortar, 
campus-centric university of today; it even goes beyond the paradigm of the 
virtual university, which remains modeled on individual institutions. The 
global learning infrastructure will encompass a flourishing marketplace of 
educational services where millions of students interact with a vast array of 
individual and institutional suppliers. It will be delivered through multiple 
technologies including the Internet, broadband cable, and satellite. It is 
being developed in phases, but will ultimately cross all institutional, state, 
and national borders.<br>
<br>
<strong>The global learning infrastructure draws 
its capabilities from digital technology and the Internet.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It could not have existed five years ago -- but it will be pervasive five years 
from now. At the technology core of the global learning infrastructure are 
fully interoperable modules and an enabling infrastructure which will:<br>
<br>

<strong>Extend access to virtually anyone including old and young, part- and 
full-time.</strong>&nbsp; Provide convenient anytime/anywhere/anyhow access to 
support continuous education.&nbsp; Deliver high quality, self-paced, 
customized, world-class content and pedagogy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be cost effective, 
dramatically reducing the two biggest costs of the current system: faculty and 
physical plant.&nbsp; Capitalize on market forces to achieve these goals and 
provide the flexibility to respond to evolving requirements.<br>
<br>
 
Undoubtedly, individual institutions will exploit these technologies to advance 
their programs. But without conscious, concerted effort, the results will be a 
continuation of today's inadequate, piecemeal solutions. The challenge -- and 
extraordinary opportunity -- is to develop an integrated global learning 
infrastructure to meet the educational needs of the 21st century.</p>

 University of Phoenix</p> 
<p>&quot;<b>U. of Phoenix Reports on Its Students' Academic Achievement,</b>
&quot; by Goldie Blumenstyk,<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, June 5, 2008 
--- http://chronicle.com/daily/2008/06/3115n.htm?utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The University of Phoenix is often derided by traditional academics for 
caring more about its bottom line than about academic quality, and every year, 
the annual report issued by its parent company focuses more on profits than 
student performance.</p> 
<p>The institution that has become the largest private university in North 
America is releasing its first &quot;Annual Academic Report<i>,&quot;</i> which 
it will make available on its <b> Web site</b> today.<i> </i>The university's 
leaders say the findings show that its educational model is effective in 
helping students succeed in college, especially those who are underprepared.</p>
<p>Freshmen at the University of Phoenix enter with reading, writing, and 
mathematical skills that are, on average, below those of other college 
students, but according to data from standardized tests, Phoenix students 
appear to improve in those skills at a greater rate than do students at other 
colleges.</p> 
<p>And in a comparison of students who enter college with &quot;risk 
factors&quot; that often contribute to their dropping out, Phoenix's rates of 
completion for a bachelor's degree were substantially higher than for 
institutions over all.</p> 
<p>William J. Pepicello, president of the 330,000-student university, said 
those and other findings shared in advance with<i>The Chronicle</i> show that 
the 32-year-old, open-access institution is fulfilling its goals.</p> 
<p>&quot;This ties into our social mission for our university,&quot; said Mr. 
Pepicello, in an interview at the company's headquarters here. &quot;We take 
these students and we do give them a significant increase in skills.&quot;</p> 
<p>Phoenix for years has been extensively measuring and monitoring student 
progress for internal purposes, using the data to change the content and design 
of its courses or to reshape its approach to remedial education.</p> 
<p>It decided to develop and publish this report&mdash;distinct from the 
financial reports that its parent company, the $2.6-billion Apollo Group Inc., 
regularly provides&mdash;as &quot;a good-faith attempt on our part&quot; to 
show the university's commitment to growing public demand for more 
accountability by institutions of higher education, said Mr. Pepicello.</p> 
<p>He and other university leaders fully expect some challenges to the 
findings, but they say the institution, by publishing the report, is showing 
its willingness to confront scrutiny of its educational record from within 
academe. &quot;It lets us, in a public forum, talk to our colleagues about what 
we do and how well we do it,&quot; said Mr. Pepicello.</p> 
<p>The introduction this academic year of a test that could be administered to 
both campus-based and distance-education students&mdash;the Measure of Academic 
Proficiency and Progress exam by the Educational Testing Service&mdash;also 
made this kind of reporting possible, he said. Nearly two-thirds of Phoenix 
students attend online.</p> 
<p>Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and 
Higher Education, said that although he had not yet seen Phoenix's data, its 
decision to publish such a report was &quot;a very positive development.&quot;
</p> 
<p>He has urged colleges to be open in their reporting on themselves. Even if 
the university has chosen to release data that put it in the best light, as 
others often do, Mr. Callan said the report will be a significant piece of the 
national debate over what value an institution can add to a student.</p> 
<p>&quot;For higher education, it is a positive and useful and constructive 
approach,&quot; Mr. Callan said. Publication of the report, he added, was in 
line with other efforts by the university &quot;to be part of the discussion on 
the outcomes of higher education.&quot; Those efforts include the university's 
recent creation of a research center on adult learners (for which Mr. Callan is 
an unpaid adviser).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>A Mixed Report Card </h4> 
<p>In the report, some of those outcomes look better than others. </p> 
<p>&quot;It certainly is not perfect,&quot; said Mr. Pepicello of some of the 
test scores. &quot;It is where we are.&quot;</p> 
<p>In its report, Phoenix shows the results from its 1,966 students who took 
the MAPP test this year, compared with the national sample of more than 376,000 
students from about 300 institutions. </p> 
<p>The results show that in reading, critical thinking, and writing, its 
freshmen scored below those of the population over all, but the difference 
between those scores and those of its seniors was greater than for the 
population at large. The difference was more marked in mathematics, although 
the university's freshmen and seniors' scores were both notably lower than 
those of the whole test-taking pool.</p> 
<p>Bill Wynne, MAPP test product specialist, said that without knowing more 
about the makeup of the comparative samples and other information, he could not 
characterize the statistical significance of the gains the university was 
reporting, except that they were at least as good as those reported by the 
national cross section. &quot;The magnitude of the change is in the eye of the 
beholder,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Mr. Pepicello said he wished the seniors' scores were higher, particularly 
in math, but he considered all of the findings positive because they indicated 
that students improve when they attend. &quot;This doesn't embarrass me,&quot; 
he said. &quot;This is really good information for us to really improve our 
institution.&quot;</p> 
<p>(Phoenix did not track the progress of individual students, but MAPP 
officials said the university's pool of freshmen and seniors taking the test 
was large enough and random enough to justify its using different groups of 
students for comparisons.)</p> 
<p>In another test, involving a smaller pool of students, the Phoenix 
students' &quot;information literacy&quot; skills for such tasks as evaluating 
sources and understanding economic, legal, and social issues were also 
comparable to or significantly higher than the mean scores in several 
categories. Adam Honea, the provost, said the findings from the Standardized 
Assessment of Information Literacy Skills test, developed at Kent State 
University, were important to the institution since &quot;information literacy 
is a goal of ours.&quot;</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>A few weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that 
looked at 12 years' worth of education studies, and found that online learning 
has clear advantages over face-to-face instruction.<br>
<br>
 The study, 
&quot;An Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A 
Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies,&quot; stated that 
&ldquo;students who took all or part of their class online performed better, on 
average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face 
instruction.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Except for one article, on this Web site, you 
probably didn&rsquo;t hear about it -- and neither did anyone else.<br>
<br>
 
But imagine for a moment that the report came to the opposite conclusion. 
I&rsquo;m sure that if the U.S. Department of Education had published a report 
showing that students in online learning environments performed<i>worse</i>, 
there would have been a major outcry in higher education with calls to shut 
down distance-learning programs and close virtual campuses.<br>
<br>
 I believe 
the reason that the recent study elicited so little commentary is due to the 
fact that it flies in the face of the biases held by some across the higher 
education landscape. Yet this study confirms what those of us working in 
distance education have witnessed for years: Good teaching helps students 
achieve, and good teaching comes in many forms.<br>
<br>
 We know that online 
learning requires devout attention on the part of both the professor and the 
student -- and a collaboration between the two -- in a different way from that 
of a face-to-face classroom. These critical aspects of online education are 
worth particular mention:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Greater student engagement</b>: In an online classroom, there is no 
back row and nowhere for students to hide. Every student participates in class.
</li> 
<li><b>Increased faculty attention</b>: In most online classes, the 
faculty&rsquo;s role is focused on mentoring students and fostering discussion. 
Interestingly, many faculty members choose to teach online because they want<i>
more</i> student interaction. </li> 
<li><b>Constant access</b>: The Internet is open 24/7, so students can share 
ideas and &ldquo;sit in class&rdquo; whenever they have time or when an idea 
strikes -- whether it be the dead of night or during lunch. Online learning 
occurs on the student&rsquo;s time, making it more accessible, convenient, and 
attainable.</li> </ul> 
<p>At Walden University, where I am president, we have been holding ourselves 
accountable for years, as have many other online universities, regarding 
assessment. All universities must ensure that students are meeting program 
outcomes and learning what they need for their jobs. To that end, universities 
should be better able to demonstrate -- quantitatively and qualitatively -- the 
employability and success of their students and graduates.</p> 
<p>Recently, we examined the successes of Walden graduates who are teachers in 
the Tacoma, Wash., public school system, and found that students in Walden 
teachers&rsquo; classes tested with higher literacy rates than did students 
taught by teachers who earned their master&rsquo;s from other universities. 
There could be many reasons for this, but, especially in light of the U.S. 
Department of Education study, it seems that online learning has contributed 
meaningfully to their becoming better teachers.</p> 
<p>In higher education, there is still too much debate about how we are 
delivering content: Is it online education, face-to-face teaching, or hybrid 
instruction? It&rsquo;s time for us to stop categorizing higher education by 
the medium of delivery and start focusing on its impact and outcomes.<br>
<br>
 
Recently, President Obama remarked, &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a possibility 
that online education can provide, especially for people who are already in the 
workforce and want to retrain, the chance to upgrade their skills without 
having to quit their job.&rdquo; As the U.S. Department of Education study 
concluded, online education can do that and much more.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> But Kaplan above ignores some of the dark side aspects of distance 
education and education technology in general --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/theworry.htm <br>
 The biggest hurdle, in 
my opinion, is that if distance education is done correctly with intensive 
online communications, instructors soon become burned out. In an effort to 
avoid burn out, much of the learning effectiveness is lost. Hence the distance 
education paradox.</p>

 &quot;Online 
learning boosts student performance,&quot; by Don Tapscott,<i>&nbsp;Grownup 
Digital</i>, August 20, 2009 ---  
http://www.grownupdigital.com/index.php/2009/08/online-learning-boosts-student-performance/
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The U.S. Department of Education has just released a report comparing 
traditional face-to-face classroom instruction to learning supplemented or 
completely replaced by online learning. The conclusion: &ldquo;Students who 
took all or part of their class online performed better, on average, than those 
taking the same course through traditional face-to-face instruction.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The most effective teaching method blended face-to-face learning with 
online learning. The study notes that this blended learning often includes 
additional learning time because students can proceed at their own pace and 
lets them repeat material they find difficult.</p> 
<p>The 93-page report, entitled an Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in 
Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies, was 
conducted by SRI International. Researchers looked at more than a thousand 
studies conducted between 1996 to 2008. Analysts then screened these studies to 
find those that (a) contrasted an online to a face-to-face condition, (b) 
measured student learning outcomes, (c) used a rigorous research design, and 
(d) provided adequate information to calculate an effect size.</p> 
<p>Most of the comparative studies were done in colleges and adult 
continuing-education programs of various kinds, including medical training, 
higher education and corporate training. The researchers said they were 
surprised to find so few rigorous studies of K-12 students, so the report urges 
caution when applying the results to younger students.</p> 
<p>Barbara Means, the study&rsquo;s lead author and an educational 
psychologist at SRI International, was quoted on the New York Times&rsquo; 
website that &ldquo;The study&rsquo;s major significance lies in demonstrating 
that online learning today is not just better than nothing - it actually tends 
to be better than conventional instruction.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The story notes that until fairly recently, online education amounted to 
little more than electronic versions of the old-line correspondence courses. 
That has really changed with arrival of Web-based video, instant messaging and 
collaboration tools. The study was limited to research of Web-based instruction 
(i.e., eliminating studies of video- and audio-based telecourses or 
stand-alone, computer-based instruction). </p> 
<p>The real promise of online education is providing learning experiences that 
are more tailored to individual students than is possible in classrooms. In 
Grown Up Digital, I describe this as &ldquo;student-focused&rdquo; learning as 
opposed to traditional &ldquo;teacher-focused&rdquo; broadcast techniques with 
the teacher in front of a large class. The story correctly notes that online 
learning enables more &ldquo;learning by doing,&rdquo; which many students find 
more engaging and useful.</p> 
<p>The moral of the story: Students would be better served with much of the 
curriculum being online. And to repeat what I said in the book, this does not 
mean a diminished role for teachers. Their time would be freed up to give 
extremely valuable one-on-one teaching. </p> </blockquote>

competency-based I mean that instructors have inputs in designing examinations 
for all students in the program, but at the same time, have no input in grading 
individual students. There can be no instructor-option subjective factors when 
assigning grades, which means no changes in grade for effort and interpersonal 
relationships.</p> 
<p>The success of the CASB program, however, is a bit biased as is the success 
of the ADEPT Masters of Engineering distance education program in Electrical 
Engineering at Stanford University. Firstly, students admitted to these 
programs were top undergraduate students majoring in very difficult 
concentrations. Secondly, in the case of the CASB, the students are all 
employed full time in Chartered Accountancy firms and are under heavy pressure 
to do well at all stages of the three year program.</p> 
<p>Students do meet face-to-face on some weekends (monthly?) for some live 
classes --- case studies and examinations..</p> 
<p>One other competency-based distance education program that has been booming 
in recent years is Western Governors University in the U.S. ---
http://www.wgu.edu/ </p> 
<p>Most other distance education programs allow instructors more latitude in 
assigning grades.</p> 
<p>Bob Jensen</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The one thing to keep in mind is that there is no one pedagogy that is best 
in all circumstances. And our best students are probably going to get A grades 
under any pedagogy --- 
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm#AssessmentIssues&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The failing of distance education lies more in the instructors than the 
students. If done well, distance education tends to burn out instructors and 
takes an extraordinary amount of time relative to teaching onsite. If done 
poorly, the culprit is most likely the tendency to assign part-time or 
otherwise non-tenured instructors to the distance education courses. At the 
other extreme we have the dregs of the tenured faculty assigned to the distance 
education division.</p> 
<p>The really bright spots in distance education are the times when the 
practicing professionals who are really good at their craft take on a distance 
education course either as a public service or as an experiment to see how they 
like teaching. The University of Phoenix has been good at attracting some top 
professionals.</p>

<p>I've always believed that the role of the teacher is one of

to move from one place to another - from point A to point B.&nbsp; This could 
be from textbook to student, it could be from the outside world to the student, 
from another student to the student, from the student him or herself to that 
same student AND from teacher to student (me to them).&nbsp; In defining the 
word 'teaching', I think many people overemphasize the last transition that I 
mentioned, thinking that the primary movement of information is from them(the 
teacher) to the students.&nbsp; In fact, it constitutes a minority of total 
facilitated information flow in a college classroom.&nbsp; I think this 
misunderstanding leads many to underestimate the value of other sources in the 
education process other than themselves.&nbsp; Online content is just one of 
many alternative sources.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, online formats do allow certain professors to hide behind 
the electronic cloak and politely excuse themselves from the equation, which 
greatly hurts the student.&nbsp; Also, online formats can be fertile ground for 
professors who lack not only the desire to 'teach' but the ability and thus 
become mere administrators versus teachers.</p>

<p>  It is often the case that distance education courses are taught by 
non-tenured instructors, and non-tenured instructors may be easier with respect 
to grading than tenured faculty because they are even more in need of strong 
teaching evaluations --- so as to not lose their jobs. The problem may have 
nothing whatsoever to do with online versus onsite education ---ergo 
misconstrued causality.</p> 
<p>  I think it&rsquo;s very rewarding to look at grading in formal studies 
using the same full-time faculty teaching sections of online versus onsite 
students. By formal study, I mean using the same instructors, the same 
materials, and essentially the same examinations. The major five-year, 
multimillion dollar study that first caught my eye was the SCALE experiments on 
the campus of the University of Illinois where 30 courses from various 
disciplines were examined over a five year experiment.</p> 
<p>  Yes the SCALE experiments showed that some students got higher grades 
online, notably B students who became A students and C students who became A 
students. The online pedagogy tended to have no effect on D and F students ---

<p>  Listen to Dan Stone&rsquo;s audio about the SCALE Experiments ---  
http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/000cpe/00start.htm </p> 
<p>  But keep in mind that in the SCALE experiments, the same instructor of a 
course was grading both the online and onsite sections of the same course. The 
reason was not likely to be that online sections were easier. The SCALE 
experiments collected a lot of data pointing to more intense communications 
with instructors and more efficient use of student&rsquo;s time that is often 
wasted in going to classes.</p> 
<p>  The students in the experiment were full time on campus students, such 
that the confounding problems of having adult part-time students was not a 
factor in the SCALE experiments of online, asynchronous learning.</p>

<p>  A Statement About Why the SCALE Experiments Were Funded<br>
 ALN = 
Asynchronous Learning<br>
<i>We are particularly interested in new outcomes 
that may be possible through ALN. Asynchronous computer networks have the 
potential to</i> <strong> improve contact with faculty</strong><i>, perhaps 
making self-paced learning a realizable goal for some off- and on-campus 
students. For example, a motivated student could progress more rapidly toward a 
degree. Students who are motivated but find they cannot keep up the pace, may 
be able to slow down and take longer to complete a degree, and not just drop 
out in frustration. So we are interested in what impact ALN will have on 
outcomes such as time-to-degree and student retention. There are many 
opportunities where ALN may contribute to another outcome: lowering the cost of 
education, e.g., by naturally introducing new values for old measures such as 
student-faculty ratios. A different kind of outcome for learners who are 
juggling work and family responsibilities, would be to be able to earn a degree 
or certification at home. This latter is a special focus for us.</i></p>

I teach four sections of ACCT 5571, Taxation for Business 
Entities.&nbsp; Three sections are in the summer and have between 85 and 105 
students total.&nbsp; We cap sections at 35 students.&nbsp; I teach one section 
in the fall, and occasionally I have an overload for a FTF PhD seminar. 
&nbsp;Our offload courses are paid at the same rate whether they are online of 
FTF.</p> 
<p> I just finished reading a couple archive articles on online teaching from 
the Chronicle of Higher Education, one write who hated online teaching and 
another who loved it.&nbsp; I am one who loves online teaching, but I miss 
being the &ldquo;sage on the stage&rdquo; on occasion.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s 
because of my wants, not because I think it is a more effective way to 
teach.&nbsp; There are ways to overcome every obstacle the negative article 
described, with perhaps time being the toughest one to handle. I have noticed, 
however, over the years that students use AIM, my chat tool of choice, to 
contact me less often, but instead work with other students online more 
often.&nbsp; Perhaps my materials are becoming better over time, so there is 
less confusion.&nbsp; I created my own online text with links to spreadsheets, 
videos, and self-tests incorporated in the modules. In addition, I create new 
homework sets every semester because I know my old ones are out there in 
cyberspace.&nbsp; I do not charge any textbook fee because my modules are 
personal, incorporating pictures of grandchildren on occasion, and certainly 
humor here and there.&nbsp; I really enjoy playing with technology, so teaching 
online gives me a chance to explore new ways of providing learning tools.</p> 
<p> Perhaps the biggest advantage we have at UConn is that we have TAs for our 
MSA courses.&nbsp; My TA was one of my top students, and he applied to become 
my TA after he earned his MSA.&nbsp; He handles one of the 3 scheduled nights 
of office hours, works on the homework sets (either he writes them and I review 
them or vice versa), and he grades the three Excel projects after I run them 
through a grading macro. I generally go online at various times besides the 
scheduled office hours, which run from 7 to 10 three nights a week, with the 
deal that if anyone is online needing help we stay online to help.&nbsp; 
Thursdays are my toughest days because I am frequently on until 11 or 
11:30.&nbsp; I also log on AIM when students set up a time they want to 
meet.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> My students meet at least once a week in a group chat session, and they 
post the chats on the group boards (or forums as some instructors call 
them)..&nbsp; The most time consuming thing that I do is read the chats which 
sometimes go on for several hours, depending on how lengthy the homework 
quizzes are.&nbsp; I create a summary of the week, using snippets of chat that 
made me laugh, cry, or go omg.&nbsp; I do not use the student names, but as the 
semester goes on they try to figure out what will get captured in the summary 
of the week.&nbsp; I also can figure out where students are having trouble when 
more than one group is struggling with an issue, and I can respond by revising 
the content module.&nbsp; I also have boards that are dedicated to the content 
modules, the homework (quizzes), projects, and exams.&nbsp; I praise students 
who find errors or confusing wording.&nbsp; The course is very 
interactive.&nbsp; At the end of the semester, I feel the same pangs of loss 
that I felt when my FTF classes ended.&nbsp; In many ways, I know my online 
students better and many stay in touch.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> That was way more than you wanted to know, but I get carried away when I 
talk about online teaching.&nbsp; And now I am going back to my vacation.&nbsp;

<p>&quot;<b>The Puzzle of Boys:&nbsp; Scholars and others debate what it means 
to grow up male in America</b>,&quot; by Thomas Bartlett, <i>Chronicle of 
Higher Education's Chronicle Review</i>, November 22, 2009 --- <br>
 &nbsp;
http://chronicle.com/article/The-Puzzle-of-Boys/49193/</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>My son just turned 3. He loves trains, fire trucks, tools of all kinds, 
throwing balls, catching balls, spinning until he falls down, chasing cats, 
tackling dogs, emptying the kitchen drawers of their contents, riding a 
tricycle, riding a carousel, pretending to be a farmer, pretending to be a cow, 
dancing, drumming, digging, hiding, seeking, jumping, shouting, and collapsing 
exhausted into a Thomas the Tank Engine bed wearing Thomas the Tank Engine 
pajamas after reading a Thomas the Tank Engine book.</p> 
<p>That doesn't make him unusual; in fact, in many ways, he couldn't be more 
typical. Which may be why a relative recently said, &quot;Well, he's definitely 
all boy.&quot; It's a statement that sounds reasonable enough until you think 
about it. What does &quot;all boy&quot; mean? Masculine? Straight? Something 
else? Are there partial boys? And is this relative aware of my son's fondness 
for Hello Kitty and tea sets? </p> 
<p>These are the kinds of questions asked by anxious parents and, 
increasingly, academic researchers. Boyhood studies&mdash;virtually unheard of 
a few years ago&mdash;has taken off, with a shelf full of books already 
published, more on the way, and a new journal devoted to the subject. Much of 
the focus so far has been on boys falling behind academically, paired with the 
notion that school is not conducive to the way boys learn. What motivates boys, 
the argument goes, is different from what motivates girls, and society should 
adjust accordingly.</p> 
<p>Not everyone buys the boy talk. Some critics, in particular the American 
Association of University Women, contend that much of what passes for research 
about boyhood only reinforces stereotypes and arrives at simplistic 
conclusions: Boys are competitive! Boys like action! Boys hate books! They 
argue that this line of thinking miscasts boys as victims and ignores the very 
real problems faced by girls.</p> 
<p>But while this debate is far from settled, the field has expanded to 
include how marketers target boys, the nature of boys' friendships, and a host 
of deeper, more philosophical issues, all of which can be boiled down, more or 
less, to a single question: Just what are boys, anyway?</p> 
<p>One of the first so-called boys' books, Michael Gurian's The Wonder of 
Boys, was not immediately embraced by publishers. In fact, it was turned down 
by 25 houses before finally being purchased by Tarcher/Putnam for a modest sum. 
This was in the mid-1990s, and everyone was concerned about girls. Girls were 
drowning in the &quot;sea of Western culture,&quot; according to Carol 
Gilligan. In Reviving Ophelia, Mary Pipher bemoaned a 
&quot;girl-poisoning&quot; culture that emphasized sexiness above all else. </p>
<p>Boys weren't the story. No one wanted to read about them. </p> 
<p>Or so publishers thought. The Wonder of Boys has since sold more than a 
half-million copies, and Gurian, who has a master's degree in writing and has 
worked as a family counselor, has become a prominent speaker and consultant on 
boys' issues. He has written two more books about boys, including The Purpose 
of Boys, published this year, which argues that boys are hard-wired to desire a 
sense of mission, and that parents and teachers need to understand &quot;boy 
biology&quot; if they want to help young men succeed.</p> 
<p>Drawing on neuroscience research done by others, Gurian argues that boy 
brains and girl brains are fundamentally dissimilar. In the nature versus 
nurture debate, Gurian comes down squarely on the side of the former. He 
catches flak for supposedly overinterpreting neuroscience data to comport with 
his theories about boys. In The Trouble With Boys, a former Newsweek reporter, 
Peg Tyre, takes him to task for arguing that female brains are active even when 
they're bored, while male brains tend to &quot;shut down&quot; (a conclusion 
that Ruben Gur, director of the Brain Behavior Laboratory at the University of 
Pennsylvania, tells Tyre isn't supported by the evidence). Gurian counters that 
his work has been misrepresented and that the success of his programs backs up 
his scientific claims.</p> 
<p>Close on Gurian's heels was Real Boys, by William Pollack. Pollack, an 
associate clinical professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and 
director of the Centers for Men and Young Men, writes that behind their facade 
of toughness, boys are vulnerable and desperate for emotional connection. Boys, 
he says, tend to communicate through action. They are more likely to express 
empathy and affection through an activity, like playing basketball together, 
than having a heart-to-heart talk. Pollack's view of what makes boys the way 
they are is less rooted in biology than Gurian's. &quot;What neuroscientists 
will tell you is that nature and nurture are bonded,&quot; says Pollack. 
&quot;How we nurture from the beginning has an effect.&quot; Real Boys earned a 
stamp of approval from Mary Pipher, who writes in the foreword that &quot;our 
culture is doing a bad job raising boys.&quot; </p> 
<p>Pollack's book, like Gurian's, was an enormous success. It sold more than 
750,000 copies and has been published in 13 countries. Even though it came out 
a decade ago, Pollack says he still receives e-mail every week from readers. 
&quot;People were hungry for it,&quot; he says.</p> 
<p>The following year, Raising Cain, by Dan Kindlon, an adjunct lecturer in 
Harvard's School of Public Health, and Michael Thompson, a psychologist in 
private practice, was published and was later made into a two-hour PBS 
documentary. Their book ends with seven recommendations for dealing with boys, 
including &quot;recognize and accept the high activity level of boys and given 
them safe boy places to express it.&quot; The book is partially about 
interacting with boys on their own terms, but it also encourages adults to help 
them develop &quot;emotional literacy&quot; and to counter the &quot;culture of 
cruelty&quot; among older boys. It goes beyond academic performance, dealing 
with issues like suicide, bullying, and romance. </p> 
<p>Perhaps the most provocative book of the bunch is The War Against Boys: How 
Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men, by Christina Hoff Sommers. As the 
subtitle suggests, Sommers believes that she's found the villain in this story, 
making the case that it's boys, not girls, who are being shortchanged and that 
they need significant help if they're going to close the distance academically. 
But that does not mean, according to Sommers, that they &quot;need to be 
rescued from their masculinity.&quot;</p> 
<p>Those books were best sellers and continue to attract readers and spirited 
debate. While the authors disagree on the details, they share at least two 
broad conclusions: 1) Boys are not girls, and 2) Boys are in trouble. Why and 
how they're different from girls, what's behind their trouble, and what if 
anything to do about it&mdash;all that depends on whom you read.</p> 
<p>A backlash was inevitable. In 2008 the American Association of University 
Women issued a report, &quot;Where the Girls Are: the Facts About Gender Equity 
in Education,&quot; arguing not only that the alleged academic disparity 
between boys and girls had been exaggerated, but also that the entire crisis 
was a myth. If anything, the report says, boys are doing better than ever: 
&quot;The past few decades have seen remarkable gains for girls and boys in 
education, and no evidence indicates a crisis for boys in particular.&quot;</p> 
<p>So how could the boys-in-trouble crowd have gotten it so wrong? The report 
has an answer for that: &quot;Many people remain uncomfortable with the 
educational and professional advances of girls and women, especially when they 
threaten to outdistance their peers.&quot; In other words, it's not genuine 
concern for boys that's energizing the movement but rather fear of girls 
surpassing them.</p> 
<p>The dispute is, in part, a dispute over data. And like plenty of such 
squabbles, the outcome hinges on the numbers you decide to use. Boys outperform 
girls by more than 30 points on the mathematics section of the SAT and a scant 
four points on the verbal sections (girls best boys by 13 points on the 
recently added writing section). But many more girls actually take the test. 
And while it's a fact that boys and girls are both more likely to attend 
college than they were a generation ago, girls now make up well over half of 
the student body, and a projection by the Department of Education indicates 
that the gap will widen considerably over the next decade.</p> 
<p>College isn't the only relevant benchmark. Boys are more likely than girls 
to be diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder, but girls are more likely to 
be diagnosed with depression. Girls are more likely to report suicide attempts, 
but boys are more likely to actually kill themselves (according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 83 percent of suicides between the ages of 
10 and 24 are male). Ask a representative of the AAUW about a pitfall that 
appears to disproportionately affect boys, like attention-deficit disorder, and 
the representative will counter that the disparity is overplayed or that girls 
deal with equally troubling issues.</p> 
<p>But it's not statistics that have persuaded parents and educators that boys 
are in desperate straits, according to Sara Mead, a senior research fellow with 
the New America Foundation, a public-policy institute. Mead wrote a paper in 
2006 that argued, much like the later AAUW report, that the boys' crisis was 
bunk. &quot;What seems to most resonate with teachers and parents is not as 
much the empirical evidence but this sense of boys being unmoored or 
purposeless in a vaguely defined way,&quot; Mead says in an interview. 
&quot;That's a really difficult thing to validate more beyond anecdote.&quot; 
She also worries that all this worrying&mdash;much of it, she says, from 
middle-class parents&mdash;could have a negative effect on boys, marking them 
as victims when they're nothing of the sort.</p> 
<p>Pollack concedes, as Mead and others point out, that poor performance in 
school is also tied to factors like race and class, but he insists that boys as 
a group&mdash;including white, middle-class boys&mdash;are sinking, pointing to 
studies that suggest they are less likely to do their homework and more likely 
to drop out of high school. And he has a hunch about why some refuse to 
acknowledge it: &quot;People look at the adult world and say, 'Men are still in 
charge.' So they look down at boys and say, 'They are small men, so they must 
be on the way to success,'&quot; says Pollack. &quot;It's still a man's world. 
People make the mistake of thinking it's a boy's world.&quot;</p> 
<p>If the first round of books was focused on the classroom, the second round 
observes the boy in his natural habitat. The new book Packaging Boyhood: Saving 
Our Sons From Superheroes, Slackers, and Other Media Stereotypes offers an 
analysis of what boys soak in from TV shows, video games, toys, and other 
facets of boy-directed pop culture. The news isn't good here, either. According 
to the book, boys are being taught they have to be tough and cool, athletic and 
stoic. This starts early with toddler T-shirts emblazoned with &quot;Future 
All-Star&quot; or &quot;Little Champion.&quot; Even once-benign toys like Legos 
and Nerf have assumed a more hostile profile with Lego Exo-Force Assault Tigers 
and the Nerf N-Strike Raider Rapid Fire CS-35 Dart Blaster. &quot;That kind of 
surprised us,&quot; says one of the book's three authors, Lyn Mikel Brown, a 
professor of education and human development at Colby College. &quot;What 
happened to Nerf? What happened to Lego?&quot;</p> 
<p>Brown also co-wrote Packaging Girlhood. In that book, the disease was 
easier to diagnose, what with the Disney princess phenomenon and sexy clothes 
being marketed to pre-adolescent girls. Everyone was worried about how girls 
were being portrayed in the mass media and what that was doing to their 
self-esteem. The messages about boys, however, were easier to miss, in part 
because they're so ubiquitous. &quot;We expect a certain amount of teasing, 
bullying, spoofing about being tough enough, even in animated films for the 
littlest boys,&quot; Brown says.</p> 
<p>For Packaging Boyhood, the authors interviewed more than 600 boys and found 
that models of manhood were turning up in some unexpected places, like the 
Discovery Channel's Man vs. Wild, in which the star is dropped into the harsh 
wilderness and forced to forage. They're concerned that such programs, in order 
to compete against all the stimuli vying for boys' attentions, have become more 
aggressively in-your-face, more fearlessly risk-taking, manlier than thou. Says 
Brown: &quot;What really got us was the pumping up of the volume.&quot;</p> 
<p>Brown thinks boys are more complicated, and less single-minded, than adults 
give them credit for. So does Ken Corbett, whose new book, Boyhoods: Rethinking 
Masculinities, steers clear of generalizations and doesn't try to elucidate the 
ideal boyhood (thus the plural &quot;masculinities&quot;). Corbett, an 
assistant professor of psychology at New York University, wants to remind us 
not how boys are different from girls but how they're different from one 
another. His background is in clinical psychoanalysis, feminism, and queer 
studies&mdash;in other words, as he points out in the introduction, &quot;not 
your father's psychoanalysis.&quot; </p> 
<p>In a chapter titled &quot;Feminine Boys,&quot; he writes of counseling the 
parents of a boy who liked to wear bracelets and perform a princess dance. The 
father, especially, wasn't sure how to take this, telling Corbett that he 
wanted a son, not a daughter.</p> 
<p>To show how boys can be difficult to define, Corbett tells the story of 
Hans, a 5-year-old patient of Sigmund Freud, who had a fear of being castrated 
by, of all things, a horse. Young Hans also fantasizes about having a 
&quot;widdler,&quot; as the boy puts it, as large as his father's. Freud 
(typically) reads the kid's issues as primarily sexual, and his desire to be 
more like his father as Oedipal. Corbett, however, doesn't think Hans's 
interest in his penis is about sex, but rather about becoming bigger, in 
developing beyond the half-finished sketch of boyhood. &quot;Wishing to be big 
is wishing to fill in the drawing,&quot; Corbett writes.</p> 
<p>Corbett disputes the idea that boys as a group are in peril. They have 
troubles, sure, but so do other people. Treating boys as problems to be solved, 
rather than subjects to be studied, is a mistake, he says, and much of the 
writing on boys &quot;doesn't illuminate the experience of being a boy, but it 
does illuminate the space between a boy and a parent.&quot;</p> 
<p>The experience of being a boy is exactly what Miles Groth wants to capture. 
Groth, a psychology professor at Wagner College, is editor of Thymos: Journal 
of Boyhood Studies, founded in 2007. An article he wrote in the inaugural issue 
of the journal, &quot;Has Anyone Seen the Boy?: the Fate of the Boy in Becoming 
a Man,&quot; is a sort of call to arms for boyhood-studies scholars. For years, 
Groth says, academics didn't really discuss boys. They might study a certain 
subset of boys, but boys per se were off the table. &quot;I think there was 
some hesitancy for scholars to take up the topic, to show that they're paying 
attention to guys when we should be paying attention to girls,&quot; says 
Groth. &quot;Now I think there's less of that worry. People don't see it as a 
reactionary movement.&quot; </p>

<blockquote> 
<p>  Hi Pat,</p> 
<p>  Becoming a case writer might entail a career shift in your 
&ldquo;case.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>  The number one thing that leads to great cases is access to information 
inside a corporation or not-for-profit organization. It&rsquo;s here where the 
most prestigious universities with powerful alumni (e.g., Harvard, Wharton, 
Stanford, etc. have a valuable edge). The rest of us have to do the best we can.
</p> 
<p>  Of course the prestigious schools also have professional case writing 
experts who work alongside faculty, such that professors who really want to 
write successful cases also have an edge when being on the faculty of 
prestigious universities like Harvard, Wharton, and Stanford.</p> 
<p>  Having said this, there are countless cases that emerge from Cactus Gulch 
Colleges of this world. Much depends upon the dedication to case writing and 
case writing organizations ECCH --- http://www.ecch.com/ </p> 
<p>  My hero in this regard in Marilyn Taylor who got me involved in a number 
of NACRA teaching workshops (my job was only to make presentations on education 
technology). Marilyn is a management professor (University of Missouri in 
Kansas City) who has been very active in the North American Case Research 
Association. Among other things NACRA meets to critique each others&rsquo; 
cases, and critique they do. This can lead to much better case writing if 
you&rsquo;ve got a tough skin for constructive criticism.<br>
 The NACRA home 
page is at http://www.nacra.net/nacra/ </p> 
<p>  Most really active faculty in NACRA have made a career choice to 
concentrate writing efforts on cases. As a result they are great writers who 
seldom appear in TAR, JAR, or JAE. But they do get their case published and 
enjoy each others&rsquo; company.</p> 
<p>  NACRA reminds me of the annual poet critiquing conference that meets for 
a couple of weeks every summer down the road from where I live --- in the 
Robert Frost farmhouse museum. See my photograph and commentary on this way of 
learning to write poetry ---  
http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/tidbits/2007/tidbits070905.htm </p> 
<p>  The top case writers from Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton are not likely 
to be active in NACRA, Active people in NACRA are more apt to come from Babson, 
Bentley, Northeastern, and state universities like South Carolina.</p> 
<p><i>Over the last four years in my capacity as the Associate Editor of the 
Case Research Journal I have reviewed numerous cases. Many of them had 
considerable potential but were poorly developed. This is unfortunate because 
even though there is no standard formula for writing effective cases there are 
certain guidelines which I believe consistently lead to better cases. 
Therefore, at the request of the North American Case Research Association, the 
purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the guidelines I use when reviewing 
cases. I will organize my discussion around the four criteria the Case Research 
Journal uses for evaluating cases: (1) case focus, (2) case data, (3) case 
organization, and (4) writing style.<br>
