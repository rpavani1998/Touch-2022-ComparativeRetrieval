<h2>Horizontal Tabs</h2> Overview 
<p>Learn the essential components of transforming face-to-face courses to an 
effective online format.</p> 
<p>As the demand for high-quality online courses and programs rapidly 
increases, instructional designers and course developers are faced with a new 
set of challenges. Special considerations are required to ensure the 
development of effective courses and a high level of engagement for a variety 
of learners.</p> 
<p>Join us for a unique experience to examine steps to design effective online 
courses. In four sessions, we will cover re-mapping your course, organizing 
content, using Web 2.0 technology, and integrating learning design. We will 
also walk you through a step-by-step process to transform a face-to-face course 
to an online delivery format. Between sessions, you will have the chance to 
practice this process using one of your own courses.</p> 
<h2>WHO SHOULD ATTEND</h2> 
<p>Instructional designers, course developers, instructional technologists, 
and faculty charged with the design of online courses will benefit from this 
course.</p> 
<h2>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h2> 
<p>You will learn how to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use instructional redesign strategies for online courses</li> 
<li>Organize content into instructional modules</li> 
<li>Align course objectives, activities, and assessments</li> 
<li>Intentionally develop instructional activities that are interactive and 
engaging</li> 
<li>Select appropriate technology to support instructional objectives</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>HOW IS THIS ONLINE COURSE DIFFERENT FROM A STANDARD WEBCAST?</h2> 
<p>The Academic Impressions online course format differs from our traditional 
webcasts in that it offers content, networking, and activities for one group of 
learners over a longer period of time. This format is right for you if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You desire the intensity, depth, and interaction of a face-to-face 
conference format but wish to complete many of the components on your own time 
and at your own pace.</li> 
<li>You desire one-on-one interaction with course instructors and other course 
participants.</li> 
<li>You want to create a signature project as part of the course that will 
directly apply to the goals you are working to achieve on your campus.</li> 
<li>You work well in a format where a portion of the work is self-directed.
</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>COURSE FORMAT AND SIGNATURE PROJECT</h2> 
<p>This four-part program uses a blend of synchronous and asynchronous 
components to model an effective online course.<strong>During the synchronous 
sessions,</strong> you will be invited to contribute ideas, make decisions, and 
ask questions about the course (re)design process.</p> 
<p><strong>Between sessions,</strong> you will have the opportunity to 
practice the process through the creation of a signature project that is 
specific to your work and your institutional setting. Your project for this 
course will involve converting components of one of your own face-to-face 
courses to the online format. You will complete this project in phases over the 
duration of the course, and you will receive feedback on the project from 
course instructors and participants.</p> 
<p><strong>To ensure maximum interactivity and personal attention, enrollment 
will be limited. Take advantage of this unique opportunity while space is still 
available!</strong></p> 
<h2>EVENT ACCESS</h2> 
<p></p> <br>

<h5>Communication and Materials for Online Course</h5> 
<p>After registration, each registrant will receive a confirmation of payment 
or an invoice, depending on method of payment. All materials for this course, 
including login instructions for the four live webcasts, will be housed on a 
course site. You will receive a URL, username, and password for this course 
site shortly before the course begins. (To participate in the live webcasts, 
you will need a computer with a high-speed Internet connection. You will have 
the option to receive audio via your computer speakers or telephone.)</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<h5>Optimizing Your Course Experience</h5> 
<p>We have designed this course for a single learner per registration. 
Included in your registration are credentials for the online course site, as 
well as the ability to receive customized feedback from the instructors on the 
assignments throughout the course that culminate in the signature project.</p> 
<p>We recognize that you may still choose to participate in the four live 
webcasts as a team. If you choose this option, please plan accordingly for the 
following:</p> 
<ol> 
<ol> 
<li>Please note that you will only receive one set of credentials for the 
course site, and these will be sent to the registrant. If others need access to 
the course site, please make arrangements to share your credentials once we 
provide them.</li> 
<li>Also, you will only be able to receive feedback on one set of assignments 
/ signature project. If multiple people are participating from your team, you 
will need to coordinate how to complete one set of assignments and submit them.
</li> 
<li>Finally, you should consider designating a lead team member at your site 
who can enter your team&rsquo;s responses to various interactive opportunities 
during the webcast.</li> </ol> </ol> 
<p></p> <br>

<h5>Can't Attend the Live Session(s)?</h5> 
<p>If you can&rsquo;t attend the four live webcasts, you still have options:
</p> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If you need to miss one or more of the live webcasts that accompany the 
course but wish to participate in the asynchronous activities and receive 
feedback on your assignments, you will be able to watch recordings of each 
session via the course site within a few days of each session&rsquo;s broadcast.
</li> 
<li>Order a CD Recording of the event, which will be delivered to you along 
with a bound copy of the presentation materials. The CD will be shipped within 
10 business days of the session date. For customers in the United States and 
Canada, shipping is included. Orders placed outside of the United States and 
Canada will be charged an additional $35. You will also receive access to the 
course site.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If you purchase the recordings of this 
event only as per Option 2 above, you will not have access to instructor 
feedback on your signature project and will not be able to participate in the 
asynchronous activities. You will, however, be able to view other participants' 
completed projects and the online discussion threads via the course site.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning how to teach in an online or hybrid 
environment, you&rsquo;ve come to just the right place.</p> &rdquo; <br>

<h3> Sonja Lanehart </h3> 
<p> Professor and Brackenridge Endowed Chair in Literature and the Humanities, 
University of Texas, San Antonio</p> &ldquo; 
<p>This four-part webinar course was informative, collaborative, and 
structured very well for the time blocks. Our group was challenged and we 
enjoyed the topics each session. The variety of materials, speakers, and 
activities and resources was effective and enjoyable. For a difficult and 
challenging course topic, the presenters encouraged questions and were very 
helpful with their answers.</p> &rdquo; <br>
