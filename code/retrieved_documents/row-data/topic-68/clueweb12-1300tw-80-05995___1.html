<h3>Online Courses</h3> 
<p>Designed to explore topics in depth, our Online Courses provide 
research-rich content to help provide early childhood educators the background 
they need to better understand and facilitate motor skill development in the 
classroom. Each course is self-paced and takes approximately 2 &ndash; 3 hours 
to complete. You will be able to print a certificate of completion for each 
course.</p>
