<p>Well Virginians, Dec. 31st will be here before you know it. Ah, the 
holidays &ndash; the time for gifts, mistletoe and license renewal. Yes, during 
the hustle and bustle your 30 hours of physical therapy continuing education 
will be due.</p> 
<p>Now bear with me, because here is where CEUs start to become confusing. The 
Virginia Board of Physical Therapy has designated several physical therapy 
continuing education courses as Type 1 and others as Type 2. No need to fret 
&ndash; I&rsquo;ll break it down for you: The rules, regulations and 
limitations&hellip; with the snooze-level kept to a minimum.</p>

educational experience that is directly related to the clinical practice of

courses obtained in a group setting or through interactive, real-time 
technology&rdquo;</p>
