<h2>Teaching online forces better pedagogy</h2> Learning, Designing Online 
Courses  &nbsp;2517 views <br>

<p>Michael Feldstein, in responding to a comment on his review of a Sakai book
, made a statement that I wish I could agree with wholeheartedly:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Teaching online is completely different. There is no stage. You have no 
captive audience. You have no ability to lean on your physical presence and 
stagecraft as a teacher. What you do have is the wide world that the student is 
immersed in, and the student&rsquo;s imagination and initiative. So 
that&rsquo;s what you use. One of the reasons that I love working in this field 
is that<em>it forces teachers to try better pedagogical practices that they 
then often bring back to the physical classroom</em>.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>From my experiences both in HE (as a post-graduate student) and in 
corporate learning (as a learning technology specialist), I can say 
categorically that the last phrase (in italics) just isn't true. There's 
nothing that can<em>force</em> a teacher, tutor or materials designer to try 
better pedagogical practices. You'd hope that their professional pride would 
lead them down that route, but the pressures of time and money, as well as a 
lack of understanding of pedagogy often dictate otherwise. So, often, you end 
up with far worse experiences online than happen in a classroom.</p> 
<p>What I do agree with totally is that teaching online is completely 
different. Perhaps we should just accept that and not expect good classroom 
trainers/teachers to be good online trainers/teachers, and vice versa?</p> 
<p> </p>

So true and I 
can't help but wonder why it isn't more of a performance issue. You wouldn't 
cut it in the engineering field if all you used was a drafting table when 
better options are available (3-D modeling, etc.). Why is it OK in our field to 
use the same old, same old? I have to wonder if some just don't see the value 
in online learning and don't see it as better.<br>

@Janet: I agree. Continuing professional development 
just doesn't seem to play much of a part in the life of many teachers or 
trainers.<br>
