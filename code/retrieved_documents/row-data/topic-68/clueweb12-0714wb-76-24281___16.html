<p><strong>What is nursing?</strong><br>
 Nursing is one of the nation&rsquo;s 
fastest growing professions, and is one of the top 10 occupations that are 
expected to show continuous growth throughout the next decade. Over 2 million 
jobs for nurses are expected to be created by the rapidly expanding healthcare 
industry and the largely retiring workforce. Nurses fill up countless roles 
from large hospital complexes to small clinics that ensure provision of the 
best care to patients and the smooth operation of the healthcare industry. In 
addition to looking after patients, nurses are actively involved in assisting 
doctors in different medical procedures, carrying out medical research, 
providing primary healthcare in emergency rooms and record keeping. Nurses are 
also increasingly becoming involved at the managerial level in hospitals around 
the country. To facilitate the way for aspiring nurses, colleges are offering 
online nursing classes and a number of short courses.<br>

<strong>What classes are offered?</strong><br>

paced program, meaning that students can study at a speed and level that they 
are comfortable with. There are no time limits in completing a program, and 
while career oriented students can get a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) 
certificate in as little as 1 year, students who are working may take longer to 
finish the program. Instructors and professors at nursing colleges are

in the hospital environment and are better able to teach students the skills 
required to succeed as a professional nurse.<br>

 Other qualifications for nurses include 
Registered Nurse (RN) certification, which is earned after taking an exam 
conducted by The National Council Licensure Exam for Registered Nurses 
(NCLEX-RN) and follows a 2 year study program. Nursing colleges also offer 
several degree programs, such as the Associate&rsquo;s Degree in Nursing (ADN) 
which lasts 18 months and 4 year Bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in Nursing (BSN or 
BDN), the latter of which produces nurses that specialize in a particular area 
of treatment and patient care, such as surgery or cardiovascular care. 
Master&rsquo;s degree programs and Doctorate in Nursing programs incorporate 
business management subjects such as resource management, employee relations 
and policy formation. Nurses who pursue these higher degrees can easily make a 
pathway into the highly admired hospital administration departments or pursue 
careers as teachers, passing on one of the world&rsquo;s most gratifying 
professions to others.</p>
