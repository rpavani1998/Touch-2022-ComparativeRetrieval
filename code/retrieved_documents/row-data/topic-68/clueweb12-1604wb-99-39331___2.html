<h1>Curriculum: Online Courses: Making Music In Cyberspace FAQ's</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about Farmington Public School&#146;s 
Music in Cyberspace On-Line Course</strong><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>What is an online course?</strong></p> 
<p>Online courses, correspondence courses and distance learning are all terms 
for a similar idea. Students enrolled in any of these are in the process of 
undertaking educational classes or programs remotely from the schools, campuses 
or physical institutions that provide them. Students enrolled in online courses 
should have access to a computer, Internet connection, and an email account. 
Students are expected to complete assignments and lessons they receive through 
communications with an instructor. The delivery of instruction, assignments, 
tests etc. is usually provided through some type of a course management system.
</p> 
<p>Judy Nichols from Oakland Schools described Online learning best, 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mediated communication for the purpose of instruction and 
learning across space and time&rdquo; (personal communication, August 28, 2008).
</p> 
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><strong>How does an online course fit in my daily schedule?</strong></p> 
<p>This online course is taken outside of your daily high school course 
schedule. It is in addition your face to face classes and is a way to earn 
extra credit, possibly raise your grade point average, and experience online 
instruction. Many full and part time college students enroll in online courses. 
Experiencing an online course helps you prepare for higher education. As an 
online course it is an addition to your schedule but credits will be 
accumulated toward possible early graduation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>What are Course Management Systems?</strong></p> 
<p>Course management systems are usually named by the developer. You may have 
heard of Blackboard, Angel, or Moodle. Schools in the Oakland Schools 
Consortium (of which Farmington Public School is a part) use Moodle Course 
Management System. Course management systems, among other things, allow 
students and instructors to share ideas, share lessons, blog, create wikis, 
upload assignments, upload quizzes and tests, and chat in synchronous or 
asynchronous sessions. &nbsp;all in a closed, password protected environments. 
A password is required to enter the Moodle website and all grades are locked 
and available only to course administrator access. </p> 
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><strong>What is Moodle?</strong></p> 
<p>Moodle is a course management system. Students receive a password and 
access to a Moodle site that is open for them to use for the duration of the 
semester that they are enrolled. Moodle has many functions and components. 
Think of Moodle as a physical classroom where students are assigned to meet to 
gather information, discuss, and receive assignments. The only difference is 
that this classroom is in cyberspace. Moodle participants can access the site 
at any time and anywhere as long as they have a computer and internet access.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s so great about online instruction?</strong></p> 
<p>Online instruction provides you with an opportunity to take a course you 
may not have had time in your schedule for. Online courses allow you to earn 
extra credit and possibly raise your grade point average. Experiencing online 
instruction is a terrific way to prepare for higher education. Many full and 
part time college students enroll in online courses. Students who take online 
courses find that they must be self-motivated and take initiative about their 
own learning. These are important traits for successful students, no matter 
what grade.</p> 
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><strong>What is Music in Cyberspace?</strong> </p> 
<p><em>Music in Cyberspace </em>&nbsp;is an on-line music technology course 
offered by the Farmington Public School District. This high school course is 
offered for .5 fine arts credit. This course satisfies Michigan High School 
Michigan Merit Curriculum .5 credit, Performing and Applied Arts requirement as 
well as the Online Learning Graduation Requirements.<strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Is there a fee?</strong></p> 
<p>This course is free to in-district students. A similar course offered 
outside of the district would be several hundred dollars. This is the first 
semester it is offered and we are anticipating that it will be a popular 
course.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>What are the course objectives?</strong></p> 
<p>Students enrolled in the course will utilize music technology in arranging, 
composing, and performing. This course is for anyone interested in becoming a 
better musician using cutting edge technology. Music experience from beginners 
to advanced may enroll.</p>
