<h2>Classroom Learning vs. Online Learning &ndash; Which is Better?</h2> <br>

<br> Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>There is a debate concerning education these days. The development of 
online programs and classes has got people thinking if they should just take 
these online programs or actually enroll in school. However, many still prefer 
real classes because they believe that it&rsquo;s still the best way to learn. 
Both online and real classes have their pros and cons.</p> 
<p><strong>Pros of real classes</strong></p> 
<p>Typically, a class composes of a classroom, books, students and an 
instructor. Real classes are great since students get to have face-to-face 
interactions with their classmates and teachers. If they have questions, the 
teacher could entertain them right away. Students get to develop their social 
network with the people they meet in school. Younger students actually learn 
better in social situations. In the case of colleges or universities, students 
get to have more hands-on applications through on-the-job training programs 
that the school offers. The teacher can talk to students about many valuable 
life lessons that online modules don&rsquo;t have. If you come from a school 
that is well-known, this looks good on your resume. It is a life changing 
experience and gets students ready for the real world.</p> 
<p><strong>Cons of real classes</strong></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s expensive. Besides the school fees, students also need to worry 
about the daily cost of living such as lodging, food, transportation and social 
activities. It&rsquo;s also very time-consuming and will demand a lot of the 
student&rsquo;s time. Self-sustaining students might have a difficult time 
working and studying at the same time. Depending on what program the student is 
in, they could stay in school for a few months to a few years. For older 
students, going back to school might mean that they need to adjust to the new 
environment.</p> 
<p><strong>Pros of online classes</strong></p> 
<p>Everything can be found online. Educational materials, videos, audio books, 
things students need for class are always available for download.Online classes 
are very flexible when it comes to time, but this does not mean that students 
do not have deadlines to meet. It&rsquo;s very self-paced, students have full 
control on whether they want to go to the next stage or not. Students can take 
their classes anytime and anywhere, as long as they have an internet 
connection. There is an online program for almost all subjects being offered in 
most schools. It&rsquo;s less expensive to take compared to real programs and 
they can be finished in a shorter time.</p> 
<p><strong>Cons of online classes</strong></p> 
<p>Students need more disciplined if they take online programs. Since the 
biggest thing that motivates the student is to reach the end of the class, they 
need to be responsible enough to finish their schoolwork on time. Students need 
to have a stable and reliable internet connection for classes. There are many 
fraud online schools on the internet, students need to be careful andchoose a 
school that has passed the standards and is credited. Interaction is very 
limited; students really don&rsquo;t meet their instructors and classmates 
face-to-face so there is no bond between them.</p> 
<p>Whether the student chooses online or real classes, hard work and 
perseverance are the most important elements in finishing them. Education is 
important and is always a good idea to invest in it.</p>
