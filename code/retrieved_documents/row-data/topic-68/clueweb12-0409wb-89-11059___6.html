<h3>How Can Certificate Programs Help You Reach Your Educational Goals?</h3> 
Posted by:admin | Comments (0) <br>

<p><strong>How Can Certificate Programs Help You Reach Your Educational Goals?
</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;Whether you&rsquo;re interested in a new career or want to continue 
your education in a way that&rsquo;s convenient for you, certificate programs 
can help. Professional certificates are available as both graduate certificates 
and post-baccalaureate certificates. These certifications are ideal for busy 
working professionals who can&rsquo;t attend a regular campus class because of 
scheduling conflicts between work and school. Here&rsquo;s how certificate 
programs can help you:</p> 
<p><strong>A Wide Variety of Programs that Match Your Interests</strong></p> 
<p>With dozens of professional certifications in many different 
specializations, you&rsquo;ll find one that matches your interest and career 
path. Whether you&rsquo;re interested in entrepreneurship, security, legal 
studies, teaching, nursing or information technology, you&rsquo;ll find that a 
certification could be just the thing to give you an edge in your job 
interviews and on your resume. Today, both colleges and universities are 
consistently adding new certificate programs from a range of exciting and 
in-demand fields.</p> 
<p><strong>Innovative Courses that Build On Your Existing Skills</strong></p> 
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re currently pursuing your bachelors degree, masters 
degree or you&rsquo;re interested in branching out into an entirely new field, 
certificate programs can help. Many certifications build upon your 
post-baccalaureate or graduate-level work, but others can be obtained without a 
graduate degree. For example, if you have a degree in nursing, you can expand 
on your knowledge by adding certificate programs in family care or adult nurse 
practitioner skills. Certificate programs are available in a wide variety of 
fields, including information technology, criminal justice, healthcare, 
psychology and business administration, to name a few.</p> 
<p><strong>All the Support You Need &ndash; At the Click of a Button</strong>
</p> 
<p>Even though you may be participating in one of several certificate 
programs, you never have to feel like you&rsquo;re learning alone. Many 
universities match every student with a dedicated academic advisor who can help 
answer any questions you have and provide guidance at any point during your 
certificate program. From help filling out the application form, to job 
placement assistance and resume writing help, you&rsquo;ll have the support you 
need always within your reach, no matter where you live.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve always wanted to further your career or increase your 
knowledge and expertise, certificate programs give you the freedom and 
flexibility you need to learn in a way that fits you best. Just because you 
live a busy, mobile lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t put education out of your reach!</p>

<h3>Online Courses</h3> Posted by: admin | Comments (9) <br>

<h4>What every student should know about online learning</h4> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Dee Baxley and Russell Smith would be the first to tell you that taking a 
college course over the Internet was one of the best experiences of their 
academic lives. As students enrolled in Shorter College &lsquo;s Professional 
Program in Marietta , Georgia both agree that having the opportunity to learn 
by navigating the Internet has taught them more about their course of study 
then they could have ever imagined.</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Baxley is an adult student on a mission. With just under three years for 
completion of her General Education degree, the administrative assistant for 
The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta believes that exposure to an online class has 
helped significantly with time management. With limited access to local library 
resources on weekends, Baxley is happy that world-wide choices at anytime 
provide her with some very viable options.</p> 
<p>Smith, at age 26 is also moving ahead with his career as a Financial Sales 
analyst for Pitney Bowles. Working in the Southeastern Region he devotes much 
of his time to trends analysis, reporting findings to executive officers and 
senior management. A General Education major with an eye on someday pursuing a 
Business Degree, Smith feels that the melding of Internet technology with 
educational studies has arrived on the scene just in time for him. &ldquo;For 
adults returning to pursue their education,&rdquo; Smith suggests &ldquo;this 
form of study might be the right approach.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<h4><strong>Virtual Online Education</strong></h4> 
<p><strong>Online distance education courses</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>By definition, &ldquo;virtual education&rdquo; is the study of credit and 
non credit courses from world-wide remote sites that are neither bound by time 
nor physical location. In essence, a student hooks up with other students and 
an instructor in both real and virtual time. Whether in a plane comfortably 
cruising at 33,000 feet, or at home, at any given moment a student can log into 
a virtual classroom. From desktop or laptop, e-mail assignments can be sent and 
received. Study, research, discovery and new knowledge are at a student&rsquo;s 
fingertips. It is here that the student&rsquo;s enthusiasm level is piqued.<br>

 Finding the right program&ndash;Thanks to Internet search engines anyone 
interested in discovering more about online study can do so by simply typing in 
keywords such as &ldquo;Online Courses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Virtual 
Universities,&rdquo; &ldquo;Online Continuing Education,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Online Distance Education&rdquo;.<br>
 Most continuing education 
programs are beginning to do business with outside vendors who provide a 
turnkey approach. Vendors locate, recruit facilitators, handle management 
issues, create courses and offer them to their partners for enrollment though 
database programs.</p> 
<p><strong>Computer-mediated distance education-is it for everyone?</strong>
</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The main objective of Computer-mediated distance education is to give 
everyone an opportunity to enroll in an online class. However, it is important 
to advise prospective students considering credit or non-credit study that this 
form of learning may not be for everyone , at least not initially. Listed below 
are four key considerations:<br>
 1<strong>. Do not enroll in a full course of 
online study immediately:</strong> First introduce yourself to the use of 
technology by enrolling in an elective course offered over the Internet. 
Generally these courses require less commitment to time and study and will give 
a &ldquo;first timer&rdquo; an approximate means of gauging how well they will 
perform in future classes. The advice given should be, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bite 
off more than you can chew.&rdquo;<br>
 2. <strong>Making Choices: </strong>The 
advantage of these classes is that they solve scheduling problems by allowing 
learners to make choices as to where and when they study and participate. 
However, this can turn into an Achilles heel for disorganized students. It 
becomes simply too easy to put off study with all the freedom technology 
provides. Perhaps the biggest problem is going to be letting tasks and time get 
away. A high degree of time management skills are needed for assured success. 
These skills are an absolute necessity and must be stressed over and over.<br>

<strong>3. Be Responsible</strong>: A major part of computer-mediated education 
is taking more responsibility for self-learning. Instructors in the online 
environment facilitate, leaving the student to find their own way. Some 
students like the idea of having an instructor meeting and leading class 
discussions with them at a regular time. In the virtual classroom students 
instructors come and go at all hours. Some learners are sure to discover that 
this form of communication is difficult for them. How well you do at learning 
on your own will have a significant bearing on performance.<br>
 4. <strong>
Navigate Effectively:</strong> Your ability to navigate around the Internet is 
extremely important since using a variety of search engines and database 
managers is a prerequisite for most courses. Knowing how to use the World Wide 
Web, Newsgroups, FTP, chat rooms and e-mail for research and study are all part 
of the necessary tools a student should possess.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Some points to ponder about teaching and learning!</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The shift in the teaching and learning paradigm (the old Carnegie model, 
where you had to sit in a seat) is steadily evolving as technology itself does 
(the Computer-mediated mode, anytime-anywhere distributive learning). Students 
are becoming more responsible for discovery and self-learning while teachers 
take on the role of facilitators. Occupying a seat in a physical classroom for 
a specific period of time is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. 
With online access and a desktop or portable computer, students are never more 
than a phone call away from the classroom.<br>
 For adult learners Dee Baxley 
and Russell Smith, learning over the Internet has meant that critical and 
undefined work schedules don&rsquo;t have to keep them from their educational 
goals. Both agree that computer-mediated distance education is at the cutting 
edge of instructional delivery and the future growth of technology will offer 
them even more opportunities. This according to Baxley is &ldquo;just another 
magnificent demonstration of the Internet&rsquo;s capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
