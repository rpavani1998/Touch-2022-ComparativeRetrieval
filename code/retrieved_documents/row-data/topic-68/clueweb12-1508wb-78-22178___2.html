<h2>Why Online Schools are Booming</h2> <br>

<p>Always felt that it would be a great idea if classes began and ended as and 
when you wanted them to? Ever felt that you didn't want an education that 
worked at you like a cookie cutter? Ever wondered if you could switch off, 
switch on and rewind your instructor?</p> 
<p>Thanks to online schools, your wishes are more likely to be realized than 
you may have ever imagined. One million students from kindergarten to high 
school and as many more college and university students are living this dream 
of gaining a 'customized' education and you can too!</p> 
<p><strong>Life as an Online School Student</strong><br>
 With an internet 
connection, requisite software and the desire to study at your own pace, 
virtual schools are all the rage. And for good reasons. It's not that online 
schools provide 'easy' courses. But they do offer a great amount of flexibility 
that makes it a viable option for those juggling jobs, kids at home, sickness, 
aged parents and so on.</p> 
<p>Though online schools are generally associated with bachelor's, master's, 
diplomas and certificate programs, a large number of K-12 students are also 
opting for cyber classes through emergingonline elementary schools, as well as 
online middle and high schools. The reasons are varied - other interests and 
hobbies like athletics and music can be pursued; inability to attend physical 
classes; or quite simply, the desire to study at one's own pace and style. Also

<p><strong>The Future of Online Schools</strong><br>
 If experts are to be 
believed, online learning will &quot;reinvent&quot; high school in the United 
States. What began as a trend among community colleges in the 1990s now has a 
growing number of takers among high school students.</p> 
<p>Almost 61 percent of students are likely to be from high school according 
to federal data. According to the North American Council for Online Learning, 
enrollment (the total number of available seats and not students) has grown 
twenty fold in the last seven years, and is likely to grow 30 percent annually!
</p> 
<p>What that essentially means is that there has been a growing acceptance 
about this mode of education. To keep pace with this trend, many universities 
are making an all out effort to ensure that online courses are on par with 
traditional classroom instruction.</p> 
<p>California has taken the lead with a senator even introducing a bill to 
ensure that online schools are not deprived of state funding. Today, nearly 
half the states, about 24 in fact, offer public school classes online. The 
following article in the North County Times also outlines the growth in the 
online schooling sector and it's exponential growth in the future.</p> 
<p><strong>What the Statistics Say</strong><br>
 If you need to see the 
numbers to really believe in the potential of online schools, check out these 
stats!</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In Washington State alone, the number of students in elementary, middle 
and high school who are enrolled full-time in public online schools has nearly 
quadrupled in the last three years and in the last four years, it has risen by 
about 75 percent.</li> 
<li>According to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of students 
nationwide who're enrolled in online schools has jumped by 60 percent.</li> 
<li>More than 60 percent of school districts having students enrolled in 
online courses expect their online enrollments to grow exponentially. They 
predict that over the next two years, online enrollments will increase by 19 
percent and blended course enrollment by 23 percent.</li> 
<li>A survey published in 2007 by the Sloan Consortium found that online 
enrollment across the country was growing faster than average student-growth 
rates, with almost 3.5 million students taking at least one online course in 
the fall of 2006.</li> 
<li>Among college students, nearly 20 percent were taking an online course</li>
 .</ul> 
<p><strong>Is it for you?</strong><br>
 If you're thinking of enrolling 
younger students, you may have to think twice. Peer interaction and social 
skills are an important aspect at the formative stages and unless you have 
other circles, perhaps church meetings, hobby clubs etc., where your kids can 
interact with others, it's better to put cyber classes on hold or to opt for a 
blended course.</p> 
<p>Only 2 percent of students in elementary schools opt for virtual schooling 
and these are mostly students with special needs such as child actors, students 
training for ballet or music, athletes, slow learners, advanced learners or 
students from rural districts.</p> 
<p>Also, while online schools are a great way to home school your kids, 
remember that the rules of the game are quite different, there will be a 
standard curriculum and there will be assignments and tests.</p> 
<p>Don't just opt for an online school because you think that it's the cool 
thing to do: evaluate your own reasons. At the same time, don't let questions 
of credibility hold you back: as long as the institution is accredited by a 
reputed agency, you can't go wrong!</p>
