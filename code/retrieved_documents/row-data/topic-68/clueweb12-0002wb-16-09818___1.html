<h3>Collaboration in #physicaltherapy Creates BETTER Physical Therapists</h3> 
<p>Disappointed... very disappointed is how I currently feel.</p> 
<p>You're all familiar with the Staples commercial and the &quot;Easy&quot; 
button, right? I tend to think we all prefer life to be easy. Is there any 
reason we sometimes choose to complicate matters?</p> 
<p>Any successful company always, always researches what is out there in the 
world before even beginning to create a new product or offer a new service. 
Generally speaking, companies are &quot;for profit&quot; and of course, they 
have to calculate their return on investment in any endeavor.</p> 
<p>Individual physical therapists and our associations most certainly are not 
&quot;for profit.&quot; Even though that is the case, individual physical 
therapists and our association are no different. A researcher has an idea... 
the first step is always a literature search to learn what is known in the 
field about the idea. I blog frequently enough... the first step is always 
knowing what's out there before I post so I have a unique perspective to bring 
to all of you. Hopefully, we all continually learn and grow in our areas of 
interest. I assume you each have found informal options where you learn - 
whether it is Twitter or blogs or forums or something even larger like
Physiopedia. As we each become experts and continue to grow, did you happen to 
see something very common in all of those informal options? An expert never 
becomes an expert independently. An expert becomes an expert via engagement, 
discussion and communication. Do you know why that is? Experts are curious 
individuals. No one becomes an expert in a lone environment.</p> 
<p><strong>Last night, I saw a tweet from @MPascoe</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Just saw demo of http://t.co/3o8XQJP - reminds me and @SPascoeDPT 
of @physiopedia - hmmm.... #APTA</strong></p> 
<p>I got curious and had to click... and then, I was more than disappointed. 
Our American Physical Therapy Association didn't do its homework. Sadly, the 
first step was forgotten. Before rolling out some supposed &quot;new&quot; idea 
- the research aspect. Our membership dollars were wasted on trying to reinvent 
the wheel. From what I read on PT Now, the product won't be as good as what is 
already out there. One stop shopping where those contributing have to be
nominated? Come on... that is so... so.. top-downish! </p> 
<p>I vote the APTA take my membership dollars that are going to be spent on PT 
Now and give that money to Rachael Lowe. Lowe has given herself freely to 
Physiopedia. Yes, she chose to do this and yes, it started as &quot;her 
baby.&quot; It's a great free product for anyone with internet access. It is a 
project bigger than herself. It's an international project. It is a single 
stopping point of information which allows contribution from any physical 
therapist. I truly don't understand why the APTA wouldn't want to immediately 
jump on board with Physiopedia. I would like to think the APTA not only wants 
us Americans to be &quot;evidence based,&quot; but would also like to see 
Canadians and Scottish and British and Dutch and Australian and Mexican and 
Italian and African and... ALL have an option to freely contribute and learn.
</p> 
<p>I don't want my membership dollars going toward a selfish project... I 
don't want my membership dollars going toward some spin-off product that won't 
be as good... and I don't want my membership dollars going toward something 
that discludes so many by elevating others to contribute because they were 
nominated and have &quot;experience&quot;... I don't want my membership dollars 
going toward a stagnant, filtered product. I want to say NO to PT Now and Yes 
to Physiopedia. I want to say yes to helping the whole profession - members or 
not members of our association, United States citizens or not... in this 
situation, I want my association to choose to collaborate and help all.</p> 
<p>So... how many of you agree with my perspective?</p> 
<p>~Selena</p> 
<p>Oh... just a little disclaimer... of course, this is just my opinion</p>
