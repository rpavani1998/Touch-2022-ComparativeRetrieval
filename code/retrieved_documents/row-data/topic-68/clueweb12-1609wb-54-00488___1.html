<h2> What Can I Expect in an Online Course? </h2> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Online college courses are set up in a way that replicates the classroom 
experience as best as possible in a virtual setting. Instead of showing up to a 
physical classroom, students go online, enter a username and password to access 
their courses, and then click on the course material. You may recall that in a 
traditional classroom setting, a professor or instructor hands out a syllabus 
to his or her entire class and provides an introductory overview of the course 
on the first day of class. With online classes, students are typically notified 
via e-mail when classes start, and the syllabus and class description are 
available online as part of your course material.</p> 
<p>Students access online instruction differently depending on their 
college&rsquo;s course management software, but most courses are very 
straightforward to navigate. Class lectures are often made available to 
students in the form of audio and video files and reading material. Other 
resources your professor might post include links to helpful information, 
discussion boards to facilitate class participation, and instruction for 
completing homework assignments. Video files might show your professor at the 
head of a classroom, writing important information on a white board or through 
a Power Point presentation, the slides of which are often made available in 
your online course. Students will be responsible for taking down important 
information from these lectures in notes, but the good news is you can usually 
rewind video or audio lecture files if you believe you missed something 
important.</p> 
<p>Online classrooms may require you to use an online textbook, or you may 
need to purchase a physical textbook. You will need to study the assigned 
reading from these textbooks in the same way you would for a traditional class.
</p> 
<p>Many professors wrap up class participation into your overall grade in an 
online course. To gauge your engagement in an online course, your professor 
will take note of how often you contribute to discussion board threads and how 
frequently you log in to your course. The course management software allows 
professors to see which of their students are &quot;showing up&quot; to 
lectures and which are &quot;skipping class.&quot;</p> 
<p>Finally, students can interact with their fellow classmates and their 
professor via student e-mail and chat functions built into the course 
management system. Some online professors even have virtual office hours where 
you can be sure you will catch your professor online to get your questions 
answered quickly.</p>
