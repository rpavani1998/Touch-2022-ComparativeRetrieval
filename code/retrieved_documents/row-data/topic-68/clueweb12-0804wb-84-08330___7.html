<h1>Friday ReFlects #4 - Virtual Classroom Edition</h1> Friday, September 17, 
2010 
<p> Hello there.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> This week I had the pleasure of attending Citrix Systems&rsquo; annual 
analyst event.&nbsp; If the name does not immediately ring a bell for you, I am 
fairly certain you know their products, including<strong>GoToMeeting</strong> 
and<strong>GoToMyPC</strong>.&nbsp; And, as you may also know, earlier this 
year they added a virtual classroom product,GoToTraining. </p> 
<p> In light of this trip and our own virtual classroom study &ndash; set to 
be released a little later this year &ndash; this week&rsquo;s theme is the<em>
<strong>virtual classroom</strong></em>. </p> 
<p> Learning leaders have to be concerned about keeping pace in a 
rapidly-changing business environment, navigating a swirl of challenges brought 
on by rapid innovation in technology, changes in workforce demographics, and a 
challenging economic environment. Their credibility and relevancy is 
increasingly based more on timeliness (their ability to meet time-critical 
needs), rather than simply the instructional craft of their content. </p> 
<p> In light of these challenges, the virtual classroom represents an ideal 
technology solution for modern high-impact learning organizations. These 
platforms can support both rapid delivery AND creation of high quality content, 
are usable by non-specialist end-users, and yet support high-interactivity, 
high-fidelity content if needed.&nbsp; And they provide an ideal, on-demand 
environment for employee collaboration. </p> 
<p> Although computer-mediated distance education has been around since the 
1960s, the first Internet-based virtual classrooms weren&rsquo;t marketed to 
the enterprise until the 1990s.Since then, the virtual classroom has been 
primarily used to approximate face-to-face instruction and often serves as a 
replacement or enhancement for face-to-face, instructor-led training and 
asynchronous learning.&nbsp;For these reasons, it is commonly viewed as a 
special instance of face-to-face classroom training. </p> 
<p> More recently, however, the convergence of rapid content development tools 
and social software has many companies using these systems in very different 
ways.&nbsp; So, here are five reflections for this week &ndash; each using 
today&rsquo;s leading providers as examples of the evolution of these platforms:
</p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>Reflect 1: Citrix GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToTraining: 
Simplicity leads to ubiquitous adoption which leads to_____?</strong> </p> 
<p> You have to give Citrix credit.&nbsp; By several measures, they&rsquo;ve 
likely reached #2 in the web conferencing market with GoToTraining &ndash; in a 
very short amount of time.&nbsp; Their tools are simple, easy to use and easy 
to implement.&nbsp; Combine that simplicity with a low price point, and we are 
starting to hear more and more organizations tell us that there is pressure 
(both bottom up and top down) to put access to these environments in the hands 
of almost everyone in the company (not just a select few).&nbsp; And 
in&nbsp;these companies where this ubiquitous usage is becoming a reality, 
employees now see these environments as an indispensable part of their 
workspace (just as much as the conference room down the hall, if not more 
so).&nbsp; They are&nbsp;a place for everyday collaboration and for continuous 
learning.&nbsp; The fact that recording activity in these spaces and then 
sharing those recordings is now trivial also makes them powerful enablers of 
knowledge sharing, which leads us to&hellip; </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <strong>Reflect 2: Adobe Connect Pro:&nbsp; Is your virtual classroom 
platform actually a better rapid content development tool than the desktop 
options?</strong> </p> 
<p> Adobe is well known to the learning industry for two families of products: 
one virtual classroom (Adobe Connect Pro) and one of the market leaders in 
desktop e-learning development: Adobe Captivate. </p> 
<p> Like most of the other leading platforms today, Connect Pro supports easy 
and efficient creation and delivery of live, synchronous learning events.&nbsp; 
And &ndash; like most &ndash; it also provides for easy recording and 
distribution of content as well.&nbsp; This recording has proven so easy, in 
fact, that Adobe has noticed an intriguing trend with many of its customers:
&nbsp;Adobe Connect Pro used explicitly as a rapid self-paced e-learning 
development platform.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; In many organizations today, 
SME&rsquo;s develop rapid e-learning.&nbsp; Logging into the virtual classroom, 
delivering a presentation (something<em>most</em> SME&rsquo;s can do), and then 
distributing the recording as a turn-key self-paced course is a compelling 
low-cost, low-overhead option for content development.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p> 
<p> Does this option hurt <strong>Captivate</strong> at all?&nbsp; I doubt it.
&nbsp;In fact, Adobe has done an admirable job integrating both of these 
products.&nbsp; Captivate interactions &ndash; for demonstration, practice, and 
assessment &ndash; can be used in the virtual space, adding powerful depth to 
the learning experiences supported there.&nbsp; And these interactions work 
even in the recorded presentations, meaning Connect Pro enabled courses, 
synchronous or asynchronous, do not have to be simply flat presentations.&nbsp; 
Blending live, recorded, and self-directed can happen all within the online 
platform, which leads us to&hellip; </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <strong>Reflect 3: Harvard Leadership Direct: Effective blended learning 
does not necessarily require the classroom anymore&hellip;</strong> </p> 
<p> Last week, I had the chance to visit the folks as Harvard Business 
Publishing.&nbsp; One of the products they introduced to us was Leadership 
Direct, a seamless integration of innovative program content and technology 
platform designed to develop emerging leaders&rsquo; critical leadership 
capabilities and management skills in a real time, collaborative environment.
&nbsp;Participants in the program engage in online discussions, case studies, 
virtual workshops, and action-learning projects; and can access additional 
resources such as e-Learning courses, case studies, research studies, videos, 
articles and other tools &ndash; all within the virtual space.&nbsp; Webinars 
and online virtual classroom events are presented by Harvard Business School 
faculty, well-known authors, leading practitioners, and other experts.&nbsp; 
</p> 
<p> The offering has been highly successful.&nbsp; Feedback from participants 
has been very positive and overall results have been high.&nbsp; In short, the 
physical classroom is no longer a requirement; the best of blended learning 
experiences can happen entirely online &ndash; AND on-the-go, which leads us 
to&hellip; </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <strong>Reflect 4: Blackboard Mobile: The virtual un-classroom&hellip;
</strong> </p> 
<p> As part of our recent research into both mobile learning and virtual 
classroom platforms, we saw many places where these two topics are converging.
&nbsp;One impressive example is Blackboard&rsquo;s Blackboard Mobile offering, 
available on platforms such as the Apple iPad.&nbsp; Not simply an 
&lsquo;app&rsquo; for playing on-demand presentations or accessing performance 
support (like some many other examples of m-learning today), Blackboard Mobile 
provides access to an entire blended learning experience.&nbsp; Learners can 
access learning content, assignments, news, alerts, social and collaborative 
learning activities, and integrated virtual classroom spaces.&nbsp; BTW -
Blackboard recently bought two of the leading virtual classroom providers in 
the education space, Elluminate and Wimba. </p> 
<p> Like most of Blackboard&rsquo;s offerings, the aesthetic for Blackboard 
Mobile is decidedly academic.&nbsp; It feels like taking a college course 
online.&nbsp; But, as we&rsquo;ve noted in past case studies such the amazing 
work being done at Westinghouse Electric, the higher-ed model for distance 
learning is a remarkably effective strategy for blending social learning with 
formal learning in the corporate world.&nbsp; Most corporate employees are 
quite familiar with what it means to take a course over time: to meet in 
regularly recurring sessions, to have one-on-ones with the teacher, to have 
ongoing assignments, and to engage with fellow students in discussions and in 
project work.&nbsp; Blackboard Mobile brings the best of the physical classroom 
experience to the learner wherever they are.&nbsp; Social learning, mlearning, 
and the virtual classroom are colliding.&nbsp; The resulting on-demand access 
to all learning &ndash; content and experts, formal and informal, anywhere and 
everywhere &ndash;is what will make mlearning mainstream; and it brings us 
to&hellip; </p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>Reflect 5: Saba Collaboration Suite: Putting it altogether &ndash; 
is instant live interaction anywhere a better option for social learning than 
social software?</strong> </p> 
<p> A few years ago, leading learning and talent management system provider, 
<strong>Saba</strong>, purchased <strong>Centra</strong>, adding a web 
conferencing and virtual classroom platform to its suite of products.&nbsp; J
ust as the lms and virtual classroom spaces have evolved since then, Saba has 
as well.&nbsp; And Centra&rsquo;s place in their product family has also 
changed.&nbsp; At first, Centra was positioned as simply a place for meetings 
and synchronous training events, completely integrated with the lms.&nbsp; 
Today, the Centra platform has been transformed, merging with<strong>Saba Live
</strong> (Saba&rsquo;s new best-of-breed enterprise social software platform) 
into the Saba Collaboration Suite.&nbsp; The role of this new platform within 
organizations is now far more profound.&nbsp; Feature and function-wise, Saba 
Collaboration Suite is an enterprise business networking solution that includes 
all of the usual web 2.0 social tools integrated with presence, IM, and 
integrated, real-time meetings and virtual classroom experiences.&nbsp; Used in 
conjunction with the rich set of employee profile information and sophisticated 
talent management process support naturally part of an enterprise talent 
management suite such as Saba, and suddenly the result isinstant business 
community, both an ongoing enabler of and a ever growing representation of 
organizational learning agility, collaboration, and &ndash; ultimately &ndash; 
innovation.&nbsp; The Saba Collaboration Suite incorporates all of the trends 
covered in this post so far, and it turns talent management back into people 
management.&nbsp; And, that said, I have a sense that some of its best uses are 
still to be invented by its users.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see. </p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<p> We&rsquo;ve known for some time that both mature and emerging synchronous 
learning tools can provide benefits that foster productivity and reduce the 
cost of training. Virtual classrooms, video conferencing, and telepresence 
technologies can provide benefits not found in the face-to-face classroom with 
a greater return on investment. That&rsquo;s because virtual classroom brings 
the learning experience directly to employees&rsquo; desktops or, in some 
cases, their mobile device. </p> 
<p> Yet, as I&rsquo;ve catalogued here today, many of today&rsquo;s virtual 
classroom systems are now also helping to bridge the gap between self-paced 
e-learning and face-to-face ILT as well as provide powerful support for 
informal learning &ndash; be it social, on-demand, and embedded. </p> 
<p> How do you use your virtual classroom?&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Thoughts and comments welcome. </p> 
<p> Happy Friday. </p>
