 Columbia College bolsters appeal with online 
classes <br>

 Ernie Wren, an adjunct professor at 
Columbia College, prepares class materials at the school&#146;s online campus 
building. Wren owns a property management company and teaches management and 
small business over the Web. The college has 8,000 online students taking 
12,000 courses. <br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>  Columbia College has ridden the Internet wave to establish itself as one 
of the largest and best values in online education, but this year, 
administrators are talking about how to beef up the day and night campuses, too.
</p> 
<p>&#147;Looking into the future, we want to become the model institution of 
our type that combines a number of venues &#151; in classroom or in-seat and 
online &#151; while making ourselves qualitatively better and more 
flexible,&#148; said Gerard Brouder, who is in his 13th year as president of 
the private liberal arts school.</p> 
<p>Columbia College has started a five-year program to increase the day-campus 
enrollment by 20 percent, to 1,250, by 2012.</p> 
<p>&#147;We were looking at some of the liberal arts majors at the college, 
and several of them had some room for growth,&#148; said Terry Smith, executive 
vice president and dean of academic affairs.</p> 
<p>While other local schools have cut back or plan to scale back faculty and 
programs, Smith said Columbia College is gearing up for an increase in faculty 
to maintain a student-to-faculty ratio of 14:1. In fact, Columbia College does 
not have classrooms capable of seating more than 30 students.</p> 
<p>&#147;I think it&#146;s in good part because of the increased reputation of 
the school,&#148; Smith said, referring to enrollment growth of 30 to 50 
students per year for several years. &#147;We have a solid product, and 
we&#146;ve been able to grow and increase quality.&#148;</p> 
<p>Smith said Columbia College has stepped up marketing and international 
recruiting, boasting 100 international students from 25 countries last year.</p>
<p>Brouder and Smith also said creating new programs to meet market needs has 
increased students from outside Missouri.</p> 
<p>&#147;We were the first to establish an undergraduate forensic science 
program in the state,&#148; Smith said. &#147;We have established a very fine 
reputation for that.&#148;</p> 
<p>Smith said the program&#146;s popularity is a result of the television 
series &#147;CSI,&#148; and it prepares students for jobs as criminal lab 
technicians and investigators.</p> 
<p>&#147;It&#146;s very heavily a science degree,&#148; he advised. 
&#147;It&#146;s not just criminal justice plus intro to biology. There is lots 
of biology and chemistry.&#148;</p> 
<p>Greater interest in physical sciences has prompted the school to plan for a 
new $14 million science building to replace its 1960s-era building that 
formerly was an infirmary. The school has already raised $1 million.</p> 
<p>Columbia College plans to continue playing to its strength of being at the 
cutting edge of online education. At any given time, 8,000 students are 
enrolled in 12,000 courses. Seven years ago, there were 180 students taking 10 
classes.</p> 
<p>&#147;We feel the quality of the education for an online course is as good 
&#151; I hate to use the words &#151; if not better &#133; than 
traditional,&#148; said Gary Massey, associate dean of Adult Higher Education 
&amp; Online Campus, who said the online campus is growing by 20 percent a year.
</p> 
<p>Massey and others contend that part of the online success is understanding 
that day, night and online courses have different students and require 
different learning and teaching styles.</p> 
<p>&#147;They&#146;re very different populations. They are taught differently, 
and they learn differently,&#148; Brouder said. That often means tenured, 
full-time professors teaching traditional students while adjunct faculty who 
are working professionals teach online and adult night classes.</p> 
<p>&#147;Our students are working adults. They want to get a degree for that 
next promotion,&#148; Massey said. &#147;Almost all our adjuncts are working, 
practicing professionals.&#148;</p> 
<p>And those professionals are savvy about what they are spending their money 
on.</p> 
<p>&#147;We charge much less than many of our competitors,&#148; Brouder said. 
&#147;We are able to do it because we are a non-profit. &#133; Our bottom line 
is meant for the sole purpose of re-investing it into the infrastructure and 
personnel of the institution.&#148;</p> 
<p>Brouder said Columbia College has another advantage over other local 
schools such as the University of Missouri.</p> 
<p>&#147;We are a private institution. We report to a board. We don&#146;t run 
into politics,&#148; said Brouder, who worked at MU for 18 years before joining 
Columbia College, which he believes is a model hybrid institution.</p> 
<p>&#147;How do you know you become a model?&#148; he asked rhetorically. 
&#147;By how many institutions are coming to us, or ask us to come to them to 
guide them on the path that Columbia College has taken with variable delivery 
modes and various venues and has a singular mission: teaching and 
learning.&#148;</p> <i>Reach Abraham Mahshie at (573) 815-1733 or
