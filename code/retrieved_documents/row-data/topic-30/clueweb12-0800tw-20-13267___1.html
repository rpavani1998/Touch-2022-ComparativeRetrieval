<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Xbox 720 will launch next year without a disc drive.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 That's according to MCV, which says Microsoft has been briefing 
partners under what sources describe as &quot;the strictest NDA&quot; they have 
ever encountered.
<p></p> 
<p>The site claims the console will &quot;offer compatibility with some sort 
of interchangeable solid-state card storage, although it is not known whether 
this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as SD&quot;.</p> 
<p>If true, Microsoft's digital move would usher in a new era for home games 
consoles and represent a major blow to the games retail market.</p> 
<p>Microsoft said in response to the report: &quot;Xbox 360 has found new ways 
to extend its lifecycle like introducing the world to controller-free 
experiences with Kinect and re-inventing the console with a new dashboard and 
new entertainment content partnerships.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are always thinking about what is next for our platform and how to 
continue to defy the lifecycle convention. Beyond that we do not comment on 
rumors or speculation.&quot;</p> computerandvideogames.com <br>

<p>10GB-50GB download is just not practical on most people's broadband.</p>
<p>If it's moving to cart or flash media in addition to download like the Vita 
then perhaps it might be okay, but a 50GB flash drive is going to cost a fair 
bit more than a disk.</p> </li>

<p>How is MS offering a physical and digital version of software different to 
what we currently have with the PS3 and 360, the only real difference if this 
is true is that the physical games will be offered on SD type cards rather than 
optical disc, a bit like the VITA.</p>
<p>What would be a new era for home consoles is if they did away with the 
physical media and sold only digital downloads, but even then the digital only 
era has already been kicked off with the albeit poor systems like On-Live or 
PSP-Go.</p>
<p>I really cant see this been true, MS would lose so many customers if they 
abandon physical media and they surely know that.</p> </li>

<p>I believe the rumour, I accept what you say, the implications are huge.</p>
<p>Faster read/write speeds, no used games, much more expensive games, very 
little piracy.</p>
<p>The storage size of games cards I expect will be variable. Devs could make 
a game on a 2GB card or 32GB card but the price disparity between the two must 
be huge.</p>
<p>Overall I like the idea of it, probably wouldn't buy at launch but I'm one 
AAA game away from being seriously tempted.</p> </li>

<p>I think cartridges or cards would work well next gen. Shorted the load 
times, which for a game like Skyrim would be fantastic, and also remove the 
damage threat disks have. Knock your console over with a disk and its f**ked 
beyond repair, the same cant be said for SD cards etc. Only problem would be 
the increased manufacture cost as has already been said. It wont be download 
only, id bet good money on it.</p>

<p>Any disk can have a read error, theyre caused by marks, scratches etc on 
the bottom of the disk. My blu ray games/films have thrown up the odd error 
when not clean, even in my ps3.</p> </li>

<p>I expect a propriety sd card approach then with an optional external <br>

drive for those who want backwards compatibility...<br>
I would have loved blu 
ray - and hope it will also be an option.<br>
Streaming like onlive would be 
welcome too... Why wait for the future?.... Some people do have decent 
internet, and as long as it is an option - bring it on!</p> </li>

<p>if you can get an 8GB SD card for &pound;4 strap 10 of them together, voila 
80GB storage for the cost of maybe a 32GB card on it's own, In a home console, 
it's not like the &quot;cards&quot; need to be really small, they can just use 
old, cheap tech, I doubt anyone will care if the cards are the size of NES, 
Megadrive or N64 carts, if 8gb cards sell for &pound;4 you can assume they are 
a lot cheaper to produce.</p>
<p>so XBox 720 games will be more expensive than PS4 games? the console itself 
will probably be a lot cheaper to produce, and so will probably draw buyers by 
buying the console, and then they have no choice but to buy the understandably 
expensive games. but as has been said, there will be so little piracy and 
pre-owned games, MS could probably afford lower profits on the games.</p> </li>

<p>Not forgetting too that the &pound;4-&pound;5 pricetag for an 8GB SD Card 
is the price the end consumer pays. If bought in bulk, we are probably talking 
considerably less.</p>
<p>And as technology moves on, then in the not too distant future that 
&pound;4-&pound;8 pricetag will probably apply to the 16gb SD cards, then the 
32GB ones not long after that.</p>
<p>I am sure Skyrim on PC was only a 5GB install? And Red dead redemption's 
install size was what, just under 7GB?</p> </li>

<p>For 5yrs of PS3 gaming I've never had an issue with any blu-ray disc. How 
do you get them dirty? Leave them on the side out of the case? Good thing about 
blu-ray discs is that they are really hard to scratch unless you purposely 
scratch them with a sharp object.</p> </li>

Sounds like I'll have to keep my Xbox 360 then. I'm not one for having consoles 
all over the place. I don't think I could continue gaming if it goes digital, 
as you're just buying fresh air. Nothing beats going back to old games (on disc 
and cart) years after.</p> </li>

<p>Why will there be less piracy and less pre-owned games, surely the cards 
can still be sold on (Unless blocked through software which could easily be 
done with disc). And piracy doesn't matter what the media the content is 
delivered on, its about the protect the hardware / software offers that 
matters, NDS uses cards and was been hacked wide open, PS3 uses discs and has 
very little piracy. Even digital downloads are immune to piracy, iTunes is 
currently the main source for high quality HDTV rips in the piracy scene.</p>
<p>DD would kill the used market though.</p> </li>

<p>Well, <i>*if*</i> this report turns out to be true then it looks like I 
shan't be purchasing the next MS console or any other console that goes the 
digital-only route. To be fair though, the article makes it sound as though MS 
is considering using memory cards which I suppose technically is a feasibility 
although I imagine that SD cards are more expensive to manufacture than discs. 
Did anyone else come away with a similar impression from the article above?</p>

<p>While it hasn't impacted the console gaming world (yet) in quite the way it 
has impacted the PC gaming world, requiring online connectivity to activate and 
play a game (even constant internet connectivity - I'm looking at you Ubisoft) 
isn't unheard of even now. I would not put it past MS at all to sell memory 
card games that require online registration or even requires the downloading of 
a vital bit of code to make the game(s) run. That would allow MS to keep check 
and control of who has first hand games and who doesn't. *sigh* I'm tired of 
the micro-control schemes of the gaming industry and personally I'm just about 
ready to walk away entirely. Heck, as it stands I only buy a fraction of the 
games I used to on an annual basis due to this sort of crap and gaming fatigue 
in general.</p> </li>

<p>I'm not actually against the whole idea. As other people have mentioned 
without a disc drive there's less to go wrong (my brother constantly complains 
that his 360 can't read a number of his games - he had an awful time with a new 
copy of Saint's Row 3 not working properly) and it also would read the data 
considerably faster. Power consumption probably would be lower and they could 
make the unit smaller. Cost of manufacture would be considerably higher than a 
DVD - at least initially, but mass producing millions and millions of these 
cards would reduce that right down.</p>
<p>On the more negative side you lose out on backwards compatibility with disc 
based Xbox 360 and Xbox games - though your PC might be able to play them soon 
if those Windows 8 rumours are true. Maybe they could link your PC and Nextbox 
together on your home network to achieve this. Microsoft are moving towards the 
&quot;Media Hub&quot; style console and you've been able to play music and 
videos from your PC on your 360s for years. PSVita can play PS3 games (soon) 
over the Internet so I don't see how hard it would be for them to do that.</p>
<p>On a more neutral note it would most likely kill off the pre-owned market, 
ending the need for online passes - hopefully. In turn it would kill off the 
rental market as well - not so good.</p>
<p>Either way this is all &quot;rumour and speculation&quot; which Microsoft 
we all know<i>love</i> to comment on. We'll have to wait until E3 at least 
before they show their hand.</p> </li>

<p>A blank 32GB card costs a lot more than a blank blu-ray disc to 
manufacture. Who swallows that extra cost?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>the publisher - in return for each memory card being locked to one machine, 
so zero second hand sales will compensate them.</p> </blockquote>
<p>On the surface that logical argument seems to make sense, but it runs afoul 
of the same issue that the current anti-piracy enthusiasts do time and time 
again: not being able to pirate a game does not automatically mean there will 
be an increase in sales. It<i>might</i> happen but it's not <i>guaranteed</i> 
to happen - much as various publishers, developers, and others might not like 
to think it there are people who will happily pirate a game yet will not 
purchase it even if they can't pirate it. And as with most business models the 
end consumer usually ends up bearing the brunt of increased sales costs - I 
expect the same to be the case here if true, though perhaps a shared burden of 
increased cost between consumer, developer/publisher, and MS might be a hybrid 
possibility.</p> </li>

<p>Couldn't see them using say a standard SD card for this, it will be its own 
type made by microsoft, Bluray is good technology but i've noticed with the PS3 
its just really really slow for some reason, atleast with these mediums of 
cartridge we wouldn't need to worry about install times and transfer speeds 
between data and the console and loading times could be near enough wiped out, 
atleast very quick, the pcs are rapid at loading games when they come from the 
hard drive most of the time, it might be a tad expensive but if were honest 
which brand new console isn't? however i do have my fears for pre-owned and the 
price all these mediums are gonna cost, MS and Sony have a habit of really 
overcharging for space.</p> </li>

<p>Why will there be less piracy and less pre-owned games, surely the cards 
can still be sold on (Unless blocked through software which could easily be 
done with disc). And piracy doesn't matter what the media the content is 
delivered on, its about the protect the hardware / software offers that 
matters, NDS uses cards and was been hacked wide open, PS3 uses discs and has 
very little piracy. Even digital downloads are immune to piracy, iTunes is 
currently the main source for high quality HDTV rips in the piracy scene.</p> 
<p>DD would kill the used market though.</p> </blockquote>
<p>if the hardware was proprietary it would take a long time to hack. and 
pre-owning could be reduced by making it so when a game is played on a console, 
it can only ever be played on that console, unless you pay for some unlock, 
when a disc can not be modified, it's the console itself that remembers if a 
game has been played, the cartridge could easily have modifiable parts.</p>

<p> Out of curiosity, why would you be in favour of having more restrictions

physical discs. Broadband technology needs to improve alot first. I'm with a

<p>People with less than 8mb download far outweigh the ones who have over 8mb 
download in the UK. I have 20mb whereas my friend has 1.5mb download, this 
highlights the gulf in speeds in different parts of the UK oes it not? It is 
hardly appealing to the masses. Our broadband infrastructure is nowhere near 
ready for a digital only console and to think it is would be madness. The 
industry is not ready for this. What games developer is going to want to lose 
money because people do not have the bandwith to download their game thus 
losing out on a sale? At least that person can still buy the game on disc and 
play it regardless of connection speed.</p>
<p>Blu - Ray is more than adequate which is a major plus point of owning the 
PS3. I get to watch films in the best quality without having to purchase yet 
another device for the living room.</p> </li>

<p>I think you're getting confused! Solid state drives will make no 
difference, they could just as easily put the games on a regular HDD and the 
key thing is how you get the actual game onto your console. Ultimately it won't 
matter what type of HDD you have beyond it loading and copying quicker on a 
SSD, as you'll be downloaing it to your drive from the net, or copying it from 
a memeory card, copying it from a optical drive etc.</p>
<p>You're not going to sell games on individual drives, 120GB drives are still 
close to &pound;100. And 512GB drives are still about &pound;400 or 
thereabouts, so it's more likely to push the price up and be a hindrance as 
opposed to a bonus.</p> </li>

<p>Well to be honest mate, all the BRs I've watched have come via Lovefilm. 
They're by no means really dirty, but they're not necessarily pristine! Still 
I've put muckier DVDs and CDs in various players over the years and generally 
they weren't as bad as my experience with BR discs.</p>
<p>I've read a few things about the BR laser dying on PS3s, but still working 
on DVD etc - I did read somewhere about having it vertically causing problems - 
my PS3 was hot when it was vertical!</p>
<p>Good point about the backwards compatibility of the discs though. Not had 
an issue with my 360 in terms of reliability, although it gouged a massive 
circle in Halo 3 when my housemate moved it, and of course it sounds like a 
f**king train!</p>
<p>Voodoo - I don't think MS are that stupid. Unless they brought out the 
hardware for super cheap and made it a subscription type arrangement. MS will 
only f**k the customer over if they think they'll make money out of it, I doubt 
they'll be greedy if they don't see it working out for them overall.</p> </li>

<p>I dunno really far my thinking wis going lol Wasn't putting individual 
games on each drive but more the read/write speed. And getting a lot of data on 
yer drives if it is download only. I couldna really get why you would want to 
put games on SD cards on a home console? Maybe storing saves and your profile 
for playing on a mates machine.<br>
I got an email from Aria I think it wis 
with a 512Gb SSD (Crucial) for the 200 note mark I think so thought hmmm they 
have come down heaps since I built my rig a year ago.</p>
<p><br>
*Oh aye it wis 'cus I was wandering if they got the report right. Wis 
thinking maybe it is Solid State storage but on a bigger scale if they really 
are going Download only.<br>
I really don't wanna be p**sing about wi memory 
cards. Massive hard drive(s) and downlaod only (if prices nae mental) would 
suit me fine if that's fit they are doing. and even fit I wis saying about 
memory cards fo0r saves would annoy me, would it nae all be cloud storage on

<p>You'll need at least 512GB if you're storing all your games on them, the 
benefits of SSD would be wiped out by the relatively massive cost - a regular

only ROM type.(they could only be read,not written to).So they could implement 
a check and update type system on the new carts.Where the cart<b>reads </b> a 
unique encrypted key that's stored on the console(like the system used 
today,(but obviously, a disc can't update itself) ,then the cart<b>writes</b>
this info to the game cart and updates itself to be locked to only this console 
.SIMPLES</p>
<p>The whole second hand market is wiped out with ease !</p> </li>

<p>So:</p>
<p>Against:</p>
<p>No backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>No DVD, BluRay or CD playback.</p>
<p>Having to cope with 50Gb downloads on the UK's 2.5MBPS average, or buy 
games on hugely expensive memory cards.</p>
<p>Having to constantly delete old games and, if you fancy a &quot;quick&quot; 
go of an old game, it'll take around 8-10 hours to load as you redownload it....
</p>
<p>For:</p>
<p>Er....struggling here. Maybe the carts will be SNES shaped. That'd be nice.

<p>Cartridge gaming mark 2 is arriving. Makes sense to be honest as in the 
past solid state forms of memory has been the ceiling on how far cartridge 
consoles could go when they bowed out with the N64. This would also imply no 
moving parts to console ruling out many avenues of failure and allow consoles 
to regain some green credentials as these types of format use much less power 
than conventional hdds or the power used to spin, read and translate discs. 
Hopefully not the end of physical media though, just the end of scratchable 
discs.</p> </li> </ol>
