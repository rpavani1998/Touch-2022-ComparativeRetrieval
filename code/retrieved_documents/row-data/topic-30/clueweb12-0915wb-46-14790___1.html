<p>By Tim Ingham for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>An HD reworking of the original Metal Gear Solid trilogy is on the way to 
PS3, according to 'insider whispers' heard by the ears of the UK's Official 
PlayStation Magazine.</p> 
<p>In the mag's new issue, in stores now, it reports that Snake is &quot;in 
the facelift queue&quot;, and that the &quot;first three&quot; MGS games are 
set to be reborn in High Definition.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 No details of release window, price or whether the trilogy will 
be a boxed or digital product are given.
<p></p> 
<p>However, any reworking of Kojima-san's much-loved original trio will be 
music to the ears of PlayStation nuts, with the games still very much 
considered classics of the genre.</p> 
<p>  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns Of The Patriots is currently the only MGS title 
to be released for PS3. It enjoys a very healthy 94 per cent average review 
score on Metacritic. Could it be joined by its predecessors in full HD later 
this year?</p> 
<p>We've contacted Sony and Konami for comment.</p> <b>Check out a 
sci-fi-themed special Official PlayStation Magazine issue 54, on sale now.Or

<p>Somehow, despite 24 years of gaming, i have only ever played MGS4 which I 
hated lol</p>
<p>I bought MGS 1,2 and 3 from ebay for pennies but cant be arsed to set up 
the PS2 again.</p>
<p>Will this be a simple facelift like Prince of persia or more like the 
gamcube version of MGS I wonder</p> </li>

<p>Thank you for editing your post. I was about to make a comment about how 
Microsoft release some of their old games and also have short games with 
multiplayer tacked on. Ooops I just did.</p>
<p>Wasn't really a fan of the second game, and I'm not sure how the first one 
will benefit from being made HD with PS1 graphics. I just wish a little more 
work would go into some of these HD releases that aren't just making them 
sharper and pointing out old gen textures. But that'd require more work which 
ain't going to happen.</p> </li>

<p>In your view and now we know. Are you going to bang on about it until you 
convince the rest of us?</p>
<p>Not that I am a fan of MGS, but this will sell like all hell, probably 
mostly to people that have gone through them countless times before.</p>
<p>Which I get, seeing as I'll be doing the same with Team ICO's games and 
whatever is rehashed on the 3DS.</p>

<p>I must admit that I would buy it and put it to the bottom of my to play 
list. It would be a great game for the collection!</p>
<p>My son is 6 and I I am currently enjoying replaying classic games with him. 
We have been playing Super Mario 1 and 3 (2 not so much...lol) since he was 4. 
Super mario 64 on my N64 when he was nearly 5. He got a Wii from 'Santa' and 
whilst he has enjoyed playing Pikachu's Adventure he is more interested in VC 
games!!</p>
<p>My point is that it is enjoyable to play these 'old' games and if they look 
prettier with a few layers of make up then Im all for it.</p>
<p>Although with all the HD remakes it does sort hurt that sony took away the 
BC option.</p> </li>

<p> Hi, I've noticed your non biased views on all things Playstation </p>
<p> As for this point, I am going to assume you do not own a PS3 and assume 
you haven't seen GOW collection running either. Well the graphics on the HD 
version of GOW2 rivals a lot of current gen games and it looks fantastic!</p>
<p> I for 1 would love HD updates at such a high level like GOW. Playing PS2 
games look horrible on HD tvs. Roll on MGS HD 
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss </p> </li>

<p> I see you pay attention. the 60GB upscales the PS2 games but it is not HD. 
And further more the HD facelifts are more than just a simple upscale.</p> </li>

<p> Yeah they should bring it back but I doubt they ever will do though seeing 
as the PS3 isn't very good for emulating PS2 games, but then neither is alot of 
PC's.</p> </li>

<p>because backwards compatability adds hardware costs for everyone. making 
improved HD remakes of classics means those fans who want to play ps2 games can 
get an improved version of them at a reasonable price and those who dont want 
to play ps2 games dont need to pay more for a feature their not going to use.
</p>
<p>and in some cases, its actually cheaper buying the HD remakes than the ps2 
copies. ofcourse, if you have the ps2 copies you probably have a ps2 as well so 
just use that.</p> </li>

<p>Speaking of Ironside,we're due a Splinter Cell HD Collection too right? <br>
Would be awesome to play through the first three titles again. ^_^</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid 3 would be the highlight of this collection for me 
though,easily the best in the Solid series. </p> </li>

<p>Exactly but people just enjoy being c**ts. I have MGS1 on disc but it looks 
quite bad now and there are no trophies, so I would love this! I also have a 
PS2 but again MGS2 &amp; 3 don't have trophies and are not HD! Plus any any 
excuse to play them again is great! Here's hoping they do release it AND 
trophies for MGS4...I can but dream </p> </li>

<p>It's worth it for MGS3 alone.</p>
<p>Played that kinda recently and it still stands up as a great game today. 
'Twas the last game I played on my PS2.</p>
<p>There's always a mention of 'cut-scenes' with talk of any MGS game but 
people should absolutely not forget the classic gameplay packed into MGS3, 
which is the most action-packed of the Solid series.</p> </li>

<p>I own the first four Mgs games, but would be very interested in a HD remake 
of the first three, providing it is proper HD and not what they did with God Of 
War 1+2 and simply re-released the old games and allowed the Ps3 to Upscale 
those old textures. I could do that simply by putting the original Ps2 game in 
my Ps3. If they re-did everything, cutscenes, textures, lighting, shaders etc 
and released it in a retail boxed version then I would definitely be inclined 
to pick up a copy.</p> </li>

<p>  Did you even play the Gow collection? If you did then you would know they 
did a fantastic job of remastering them into HD, that much so that the graphics 
were on par with some current gen games. The PS3 did no upscalling whatsoever 
and you go ahead and put your PS2 copy in and look at how s**t it looks with 
the PS3 'trying' to upscale</p> </li>

<p>I own the first four Mgs games, but would be very interested in a HD remake 
of the first three, providing it is proper HD and not what they did with God Of 
War 1+2 and simply re-released the old games and allowed the Ps3 to Upscale 
those old textures. I could do that simply by putting the original Ps2 game in 
my Ps3<br>
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>  Did you even play the Gow collection? If you did then you would know they 
did a fantastic job of remastering them into HD, that much so that the graphics 
were on par with some current gen games. The PS3 did no upscalling whatsoever 
and you go ahead and put your PS2 copy in and look at how s**t it looks with 
the PS3 @trying@ to upscale</p> </blockquote>
<p>This.</p>
<p>The GoW Collection is gorgeous,especially God of War II,It's noticeably 
different in terms of overall polish/sheen and enhanced audio. </p>
<p>This might be controversial,but I'd rather have a HD version of Twin 
Snakes,than the original version. =/<br>
As much as I love it,I'd much rather 
see Twin Snakes,and Metal Gear Solid 2,Metal Gear Solid 3 and possibly Peace 
Walker if Hideo considers porting it. </p> </li>

<p>The GOW collection looked good but no they dont look as good as next gen 
titles.</p>
<p>Twin Snakes is the nuts but you wont get that on the PS3 in the next 5000 
years.</p> </li>

<p>Twin Snakes is the better version. Some people just can't except it and imo 
it had only 2 flaws.</p>
<p>1. They made it more &quot;Hollywood&quot; by having everyone doing back 
flips like they were from the Matrix, not really a flaw though.</p>
<p>2. They changed the accents of the women, they just made them all 
American...which is hardly game breaking.</p>
<p>Everything else is either the same or better.</p> </li>

<p>I'll buy it just for MGS3. My original PS2 burnt out between playing that 
and San Andreas so i never really got the chance to go through it a few times 
as i had to borrow a mates PS2 to finish Snake Eater. Hopefully they can get 
something in place to secure Twin Snakes rather than the original as it was 
more or less the same graphics as 2+3 and i have the original MGS on the PS3 
and it just won't hold up without some sort of overhaul.</p>
<p>Now all we need is a confirmation of the DMC HD collection and i'm a happy 
man.</p> </li> </ol>
