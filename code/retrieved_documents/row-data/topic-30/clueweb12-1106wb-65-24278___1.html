Patrick Mason commented on Sam Pham's blog post 'My 
Intensafiire Isn't Working Right'  &quot;Make sure none of the other pins on 
the sync module are touching with glue, only the center one.&quot;<br>

Patrick Mason replied to Joel Velez's discussion 'Intensafire v1.3 
Stopped working!!'  &quot;I suggest opening up the controller, and seeing if 
anything came loose. If not, you could of just burnt it out, maybe time for the 
newer versions soon?&quot;<br>

Patrick Mason replied to 
pedro's discussion 'Where to buy intensafire from?'  &quot;Ebay would be your 
best bet, I believe that it is currently out of stock here due to a new 
revision coming soon to make sure there is not faulty intensafires put up for 
sale.&quot;<br>

Patrick Mason replied to Anthony Gurrieri's 
discussion 'SLOW AUTO's!?'  &quot;This is normal, it happens in MW2 too, from 
what I've heard, it is best to just turn it off when using autos. The 
alternative is to find a custom firing rate yourself in custom mode.&quot;<br>

Patrick Mason replied to Chris's discussion 'IntensaFIRE v2.0 
Issue'  &quot;Double check to make sure that none of the surrounding pins are 
touching.&quot;<br>

Patrick Mason replied to Rackman's 
discussion 'PS3 controller mod quit working...'  &quot;They are not installed 
in Mexico, on a food table, or done half assed. This is the first we have heard 
of this issue and common sense from installing more than 50, points the finger 
at the adhesive. It most likely is the adhesive, a non-permanent&hellip;&quot;

Patrick Mason replied to Gage biddy's discussion 'Please 
help'  &quot;Please make sure none of your connection points are touching. The 
three on the right side of the intensaFIRE control the right trigger, they are 
all independent and should not be touching each other at all.&quot;<br>

Patrick Mason replied to Hungry Sage's discussion 'IntensaFire 2.0 
Keeps Syncing'  &quot;That could of caused an issue with allowing you to see it 
enabled or not, regardless it should have worked unless installed incorrectly. 
I would double check the sync module and ensure that no other points are making 
contact besides the one that&hellip;&quot;<br>

replied to tweety bird's discussion 'left analog stick'  &quot;Make sure none 
of the connection points are touching, glue or solder.&quot;<br>

<br> Patrick Mason replied to tweety bird's discussion 'left analog stick'  
&quot;Was this installed yourself or bough pre-mod? Please include more 
information as well if you run into any other errors.&quot;<br>

<br> Patrick Mason replied to Gamer4life's discussion 'Will Intensafre work on 
the Razer Onza?'  &quot;It looks as if it could and that Razer Onza is just a 
shell, but you can't be sure unless you open one and check it out. I personally 
don't like the Razer Onza, I don't find anything about it special besides the 
d-pad mod which you&hellip;&quot;<br>

any further problems, feel free to post them and I'll reply as soon as possible 
with hopefully a way to successfully fix it.&quot;<br>

Mason replied to John Edwards's discussion 'Sync Help'  &quot;Make sure with 
the q-tip and nail polish remover that you thoroughly clean the pins on the 
sync module.&quot;<br>

maker of intensaFIRE. Here's the link..

some more research to find out how to do it. Possibly try contacting BGR

Patrick Mason replied to Rob Weissbach's 
discussion 'HELP (Installation problem??)'  &quot;Did you install with glue or 
solder? Also, could you take a picture of your inside controller? I could 
further analysis it and try to spot the problem for you.&quot;<br>
