<p>By CVG Staff for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Xbox is ten years old in Europe today, having launched on March 14, 2002, 
and Microsoft is celebrating the anniversary with the launch of an interactive 
timeline of the platform's history.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 MS says: &quot;The timeline is available on Xbox.com and takes 
you on your own personal journey from your first Xbox experience through the 
hardware, software and entertainment launches over the last 10 years.
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;It commemorates the original console launch through to the 
controller-free revolution with Kinect, and the host of live TV, music, movie 
and social media partners on Xbox Live who are helping us change the way people 
enjoy entertainment in their living rooms.&quot;</p> 
<p>Along with our colleagues at OXM, we recently ran a series of videos 
sharing our memories from ten years of Xbox.Take a trip down memory lane with 
us here.</p> <br>

<p>having owned the original xbox and a very early 20gb 360, I never thought 
MS would be as successful as theyve been. The original xbox was great kit, but 
not very popular outside US and it lacked many killer exclusives unlike ps2, 
but fair play to them for managing it. i still prefer my ps3 and the exclusives 
on that system, but theyve been a great influence on industry in many ways, and 
no doubt brought with them things i not keen on too. I still applaud what 
theyve achieved either way</p> </li>

<p>Project gotham racing, splinter cell, halo, knights of the old republic , 
these immediatly spring to mind as exclusives, not bad me thinks, but there 
were plenty more.</p>
<p>Great machine, the old xbox, led the way in online gaming, and gave us much 
needed competition for the stale playstation brand, which, even now struggles 
to keep up, especially online.</p> </li>

<p>Depends on your taste in games I suppose. Don't like racing games and 
rpg's, and agree halo was awesome, but can't say series kept me interested, 
with 3 and reach being lackluster IMO.</p>
<p>At the time, the biggest exclusives in world were on ps2, with the obvious 
one being gta and even pes at time they went multi plat. It was the variety of 
games<br>
 Too on ps2, with many cult classics that weren't block busters such 
as okami.. I.actually preferred my gamecube to the ps2, but its library was 
phenomenal.and</p> </li>

<p>At the time it was just doing everything right, compared to the ps2 anyway
<br>great online service<br>
great controller<br>
great graphics<br>
great games
<br>unified headsets, that worked with no problems, and always the promise that 
things were going to get bigger and better.<br>
aahhh, those were the days.</p>

Can't see it, but it would be my summary of the last 2 years. I think 
the Kinnect thing took too much focus away from what made the 360 great. Its 
interesting kit, but lacks the games to back up the clever tech.</p>
<p>I think they are looking to the casual and family market more and rely on 
3rd party for the rest.</p> </li>
