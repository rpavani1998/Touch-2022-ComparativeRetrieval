<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Nintendo has issued a statement in response to growing reports that Wii U 
won't be as powerful as PS3 or Xbox 360.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 While few people truly know what Nintendo's upcoming console is 
capable of, development sources have claimed in recent weeks that Wii U's 
graphics&quot;are just not as powerful&quot; as PS3's or Xbox 360's, while we 
were told that it struggles to match current-gen consoles when it comes to 
processor intensive game systems such as complicated physics and AI.
<p></p> 
<p>A Nintendo of America spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied these 
reports in a statement issued toDigital Trends, saying:</p> 
<p>&quot;We do not focus on technology specs. We understand that people like 
to dissect graphics and processing power, but the experience of playing will 
always be more important than raw numbers.&quot;</p> 
<p>Supposedly leaked emails from both Japanese and US retailers suggest 
Nintendo plans to release Wii U in North America on November 18.</p> <br>

<p>Of course they do. What they mean is that they don't focus on the CPU and 
GPU. All that they have shown us for the Wii U so far is the controller and the 
case. All the information that they have given us is about the capabilities of 
the touch screen controller. If they weren't focussed on the tech specs then 
they would be showing us the launch game and how they are better with the new 
system.</p> </li>

<p>Whilst I do agree, its ultimatley how the game plays and the enjoyment you 
get from it that matters, I do think that the Wiis lack of processing power / 
gfx ultimatley led it to be a weaker console. Therefore its a shame that 
Nintendo didn't at least try to better current gen in their next gen console. 
Still, they know the market they are looking for (family).</p>
<p>I guess, like the Wii, it will end up more of a family console that gets 
dusted off at christmas. Shame as I was really hoping for a nintendo console 
that could match the ouput of Sony / Microsoft as well as have all the usual 
Nintendo gimmicks.</p> </li>

<p>I can't help but think Nintendo have dropped a b*****k here. If it was more 
capable than PS3/360 surely they would be telling us. At least in terms of 'If 
you want the best COD/BF3/FIFA...... then you have to get it on WiiU'. But 
they're not which doesn't bode well.</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong.</p> </li>

<p>Other people have already said it but Nintendo can't realistically go for 
the casual market again. The main draw of the Wii was motion control and the 
communal experience. Wii U's tablet is a distinctly single player device and 
the magic of the Wii remote is long faded. The casual market is held now in an 
iron grip by Apple. I'm sure Nintendo realise that.</p> </li>

Indeed, more fool me for stating the way the Wii ended up in my (and 
most of the people I know) household. Still you do raise a good point in that 
what it actually turns out to be like remains to be seen. I do hope my thoughts 
are wrong.</p> </li>

<p>An age old agrument, I've been a gamer for about 32 years. As we all know, 
it's all about the games, not the power of the console. But look at the Wii 
which has p**s poor power, new games dried up, but it still managed to clock up 
sales of about 95 million. Nintendo knows it doesn't have to focus on power 
(with the Wii U), but if it's true about the Wii U specs, I think they've made 
a major mistake, as I can't see the Wii U doing as well as the Wii, as the next 
console war is going to be a different ball game. The PS4 and 720 will be on 
par with each other, the Wii U wil just get left behind. On top of that, 
Nintendo poorly supports its consoles which has been the case since the 
Nintendo 64 and Nintendo have admitted that, more so with the Wii. You take 
away the Mario and Zelda games, they don't release much else, plus some of 
their games are done by other developers, so they can't even be arsed to knock 
out games themselves. And devs are power mad these days, so when next gen 
consoles arrive, it'll be about the power and the games in one.</p> </li>

I used to love Nintendo, but the 
love affair started to waver after the Gamecube. Take Mario and Zelda out the 
equation and you're left with 'family' toss. By the looks of that video they're 
sticking to the same formula <br>
I jumped ship after the Ant and Dec adverts, 
final straw for me!</p> </li>

<p>Not sure you can say Nintendo don't support their consoles, you may not 
like them but they are supported. I think Nintendo's first party offerings are 
in terms of quality, much better than Sony/MS, certainly MS as they've been 
operating lately. And all companies have developers making games for them - 
Sony didn't 'make' Yakuza, Resistance etc, MS didn't make Splinter Cell, L4D, 
Trials etc, Nintendo didn't make Other M, Sin and Punishment 2, Zack and Wiki 
etc.</p>
<p>Decisions they make over hardware puts off the third parties, and that's 
where it lacks for me - it did on the 64 and the Wii anyway, I was fine with 
the GC. Yet my favourite games of the 64 and this gen have been Nintendo's.</p>

Wii U. Nintendo knows it would be a stupid mistake to release an expensive, 
loss making console. That has never been their strategy and you know that, so 
get over it. For them it is about the games and how we play them. If you don't 
like that, then tough s**t. Wait for PS4 and 720 instead, but for the love of

<p>Surely that is why Nintendo have gone for an iPad-type controller. They 
have seen Apple's product grow in popularity and sell worldwide to millions, of 
all ages. My kids are 3 and 4 and they love playing on the iPad, it's easy, 
intuitive and fun. The Wii U can appeal to this market of family gaming, 
education etc. but at a much lower cost than &pound;400+ that apple are asking. 
My iPad rarely leaves my livingroom so portability isn't an issue for most 
people I'm sure. It will also play far superior games on it than even the new 
ipad could hope to achieve and have all of the Nintendo franchises too (maybe 
Nintendo specific apps like Nintendo character chess, mini games etc.) If they 
can market this at around a &pound;200 price point they could be onto a winner 
again. Lets be honest, Sony Move hasn't impacted in any relevant way and Kinect 
has faired better but isn't perfect.</p> </li>

<p>It potentially effects the viability of third party games on it, at least 
after the new PS/xbox consoles, which effects the user if they don't want to 
buy two consoles (I don't). I think they're valid concerns - I'd rather pay an 
extra &pound;100 for a more powerful Nintendo console than pay an extra 
&pound;250 for a new PS/xbox in order to play the latest R* etc games in a 
couple of years. To be honest there's not much excuse for bringing out a 
console that is less powerful (if true) than something that will be seven years 
old by the time it releases.</p>
<p>Instead of putting their money into graphics cards and processors, they've 
seemingly put it into the tablet controller and making it work, questioning 
whether that's the right choice seems ok to me. If you can't see the potential 
flaws of releasing an under powered console then you're not living in the real 
world - it'd be lovely if it was all about the games and not graphics, but 
that's not the case.</p> </li>

<p>I think Nintendo made a mistake of out and out saying &quot;we want to 
appeal to the core audience&quot;.</p>
<p>Nintendo follow their own timeline in terms of tech, I think it's fairy 
obvious what we can expect. A HD Wii with analternative controller (Wiimote 
will still be an option) that has graphics equivalent to the Xbox 360. It won't 
be the console that can play all cross-platform games for the next 6 years.</p>
<p>What it will be though is the console that homes HD Zelda, Mario, MK, 
Pikmin, Pokemon, Kid Icarus, Donkey Kong etc and that is a BIG deal. I also 
think that tablet will be utilized even more than people think, with talk of an 
app store and so on it will be a strong gadget on it's own aside from it's 
function as a Wii U controller (just not outside the home). It will also all 
come at an affordable price presumably..</p>
<p>All in all, the people who should be buying this will be happy. The 
graphics whores just need to move on as you are not Nintendo's audience. Get a 
PC and leave us alone </p> </li>

<p>But why would the Apple crowd give up Apple and move to Nintendo? We 
already know the Wii U tablet is a resistive touchscreen which means from the 
start it's at a disadvantage against Apple's capacitive ones. The magic of 
Nintendo faded a while ago for that market. The 400 pound cost to the casual 
gamer will be offset by the fact that they're paying 40 quid a pop for new 
games, when they've gotten so used to paying 99p for them on the App Store or 
even getting them for free. Sony and MS haven't impacted in any real way, but 
Apple totally stole that market, and Nintendo can't really compete with Apple 
for the iZombie crowd.</p> </li>

<p>The issues I see and I think have generally been mentioned is that 3rd 
party support will no doubt suffer again, the one thing Nintendo have promised 
to work hard on. Time will tell of course. Until the next PS or XBOX come out 
they might find they're in the mix with the big titles, basically having the 
same game but with a few bonuses thrown in because of the controller. The 
downside is that they're starting from a new userbase against 60 million odd 
PS3 and XBOx's alike, so the money for a publisher will still be earned through 
PS3 and XBOX.</p>
<p>Then when the next gen machines arrive 3rd party support will drop off 
particularly on core titles like COD, BF3, Driving games etc because the devs 
will be working on unreal 4 engine or equivalent. Why would a user pay 
&pound;40 for an inferior version of a game (no Skyrim jokes!) ?</p>
<p>Yes Nintendo will produce their usual array of spectacular games but the 
real money is made when you're selling masses of 3rd party games and I just 
can't see that happening. I'm still buying one regardless, alongside the next 
xbox most likely.</p> </li>

<p>I preferred the good-old Nintendo that used to have the most powerful, yet 
reasonably priced consoles on the market (Snes, N64). Nowadays they are just 
rigidly following their &quot;let's disregard specs and focus on the

by the Wii's final years correctly.</p>
<p>Consumers all over the world have by now finally upgraded to HDTVs, so

The proper source came from dual pixels or something. It said they 
were using former bizarre employees and giving their answer to GT and Forza. I 
think its good Nintendo is copying Sony for a change. Sony have copied pretty 
much every game Nintendo made so its about time they paid them back.</p>
<p>I am a fanboy and I don't shout source. I am taking this at face value 
because it sounds like something they would do. People will buy it anyway and 
its the games that will have people play it. Nintendo's games are still great 
and people will buy their systems for them regardless of specs.</p> </li>

<p>I think the pad itself is what you're mainly mean't to use, as apposed to 
the TV. Four pads in the living room playing multiplayer with whoever and 
freeing up the TV for DAD.<br>
Maybe they're releasing a cheap rez'd up WII for 
the kids, then wait to see Sony &amp; MS's cards before releasing a CORE 
product. They must be doing something with all that money they made off the 
WII?!<br>
I for one was a Nintendo fan, gamecube being my last nintendo 
console. I briefly dabbled with the idea of getting a WII but never happened. 
Playstation is where most of the games that appeal to me seem to be at, 
PS4+Move+Vita which is a similar combo in itself, and is what I see myself 
getting. I'm 28, I need some proper boys toys.... though if Nintendo release a 
console that packs some kind of a punch (ONTOP OF GAMEPLAY!) then i'm all for 
it.</p> </li>

<p>I think its a bloody disgrace that you have to wait 6 years for Nintendo to 
finally get it's act together, and when they do - throw out a console that is 6 
years OUT OF DATE???</p>
<p>People say 'the controller' is causing extra expense so cutbacks have to be 
made. I disagree -<i> the whole controller will be a cutback in itself</i>. 
Probably sporting a single touch touch screen, twiddle sticks, 800x480 screen, 
vga cameras, cheap and tacky plastic - it's disgusting.</p>
<p>I'm fed up with Nintendo releasing bare bones home console systems.<br>
<b>
<br>If they can't release complete console - give up and go multiformat.</b> I 
just hope the casual gamers have got their fill of ipads and won't see the need 
to buy that piece of junk.</p>

<p>Personally I have zero interest in the Wii-U but if they do release a 
console at the same power or just ahead of what we currently have then surely 
this could be bad for sales.</p>
<p>As other have said if you already have an iPad,then the controller won't be 
a selling point.If its the same or slightly ahead of what you already own then 
why would you spend &pound;200-&pound;250 on a new console when ms and Sony 
release there's a year later and surely they'll both be upping the ante?</p>
<p>I dont believe any of the rumors myself,il wait until E3 to hear confirmed 
specs and see some ganes running on it.If its more powerful Nintendo will have 
something special to show off then.</p> </li>

<p>Ok, I think it's time for the Nintendo Protection Coalition to pipe down 
and smell the coffee...</p>
<p>This &quot;games are about more than just graphics&quot; argument is 
getting longer in the tooth than the bloody gpu in the Wii itself! It's utterly 
ridiculous!</p>
<p>A burger is about the meat but who wants a burger with no bun or ketchup?
</p>
<p>They need to get off their lazy arses IMO and make something akin to the 
Gamecube. I remember when the GC came out it blew the PS2 out the water 
visually and my jaw dropped when I saw F-Zero and Metroid Prime. That's what 
they need to do again to convince me to part with my money.</p>
<p>It's true that they have their own unique style of games and that these 
require less visual impact to satisfy than a fps for example. However, what 
would be wrong with a beautiful HD rendering of Mario which was almost like 
watching an animated film? What would be wrong with a proper first-person 
Metroid - I think they bottled it on the Wii because they knew it would look 
like bloody Doom!</p>
<p>And a proper slick update to F-Zero...</p>
<p>They need to sort it the feck out IMHO! I don't care how many children and 
grandparents own a Wii, I'm a proper gamer and I want proper games not casual 
bulls**t. When Mario 64 came out it wasn't lagging behind in terms of tech!</p>

QFT! Can't imagine why though. Perhaps they are scared of them 
succeeding and Microsoft and Sony copying them. Maybe they are just afraid of 
change. Whatever it is they flame Nintendo here but Microsoft is becoming 
notable for pushing Kinect and there is no doubt in my mind it will feature 
heavily on their next console. Does that mean you guys will treat the next Xbox 
like you treat Nintendo now? Or because of a graphical increase your willing to 
overlook it?</p> </li>

<p>The fact is, it's the console that is different which suffers. The Wii may 
have outsold the PS3 and 360 individually, but combined they represent a bigger 
market which is more secure. The GameCube had the same problem as the Wii - it 
was hamstrung by the lack of disc space which saw a lot of games on the PS2 and 
Xbox but not on the 'Cube. And then before that, games that were on the Saturn 
and PS1 gave the N64 a miss due to its wildly different power level. Go back 
even further and that's why fringe consoles like the CDi and 3DO were never 
supported very well - they were too different to support when money could be 
made on the NES, SNES, Mega Drive or whatever. The 'odd one out' always suffers 
because it represents the smallest and most unreliable market.</p> </li>

<p>How do you know that's a minority of people? I don't know the figures, so 
I'm not going to say it a majority or a minority. As irongut said, more people 
bought PS3 or 360s (total sales of the two) than bought Wiis - it's still a 
huge, huge market and a market that buys more games and it COULD (hence my 
original post saying it's just a valid concern to be aired, not that this is 
going to happen) cause Nintendo's third party support to be weak.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure what you're getting at to be honest. Third party games 
are still games and are a big part of the line up and appeal of a console. I 
love my Nintendo games, but the lack of third party support means I have to 
compliment it with another console - which I don't want to do. I agree that 
Nintendo do go about things differently, but that's why they took a hiding on 
the 64 and GC and went down the route they did with the Wii - they didn't have 
the level of third party support.</p>
<p>And for every developer going on about the costs of development, there's 
one asking for more power as squeezing all they can from hardware takes a lot 
of resources.</p>
<p>For me this isn't about what's best for Nintendo as a company. As long as 
they survive I don't really care, but for me playing games, a potential lack of 
third party games is a concern. As I said, these are potential concerns and I 
don't think you can really have a go at people for expressing them - of course 
there will always be cocks who just make s**tty comments, but what can you do?

<p>Actually, Irongut and I are both huge Nintendo fans, and are very far away 
from 'clearly not interested in it' (I've owned and loved every Nintendo 
console since the SNES apart from the 3DS), but we're not so blind that we 
can't see<b>potential</b> flaws in the rumours about it being underpowered. The 
lack of third party support was an issue for the Wii, not saying there weren't 
some brilliant games (my favourites this gen in fact), but to attempt to 
dismiss people airing their potential (there's that word again) concerns in a 
mature way and telling them to 'move on' is either arrogant or delusional.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it won't sell, it won't be successful but am concerned it

has always been the least powerful console which sold the most and the reason 
for that was due to the quantity of quality games. It was the games that sold 
the consoles. The minority are those that buy them for being powerful. How do I 
know this? Because I have never, in my 25 years of gaming, heard of people 
buying consoles for that reason. And I have always tried to keep up to date 
with industry news since the 90's.</p>
<p>No, I didn't like that part. I can't say that without conducting a study 
lol. But seriously, people buy consoles in order to play the game/games they 
wanted. I find it very hard to believe that many people are happy to buy a 
console, with no games, purely on the basis that it is more powerful than the 
competition.</p> </li>

<p>@lordirongut and ricflair</p> 
<p>I'm sorry but I don't agree with either of you regarding your most recent 
comments. It is clear that our approach to gaming and our opinions regarding 
the industry are completely different. We'll just have to agree to disagree and 
in the end only time will tell what will happen. So, I refer back to my very 
first post, &quot;if you don't like it, go buy your PS4/720 and stop whining 
about Wii U&quot;. You clearly aren't interested in it so just state so and 
move on.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Actually, Irongut and I are both huge Nintendo fans, and are very far away 
from 'clearly not interested in it' (I've owned and loved every Nintendo 
console since the SNES apart from the 3DS), but we're not so blind that we 
can't see<b>potential</b> flaws in the rumours about it being underpowered. The 
lack of third party support was an issue for the Wii, not saying there weren't 
some brilliant games (my favourites this gen in fact), but to attempt to 
dismiss people airing their potential (there's that word again) concerns in a 
mature way and telling them to 'move on' is either arrogant or delusional.</p> 
<p>I'm not saying it won't sell, it won't be successful but am concerned it 
won't meet all of my needs, which I'd rather it did.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I'm not saying you aren't Nintendo fans, not that that should make a 
difference, although, come to think of it, it could be that that is the reason 
you are annoyed with Nintendo for not steering their business plan down your 
preferred route. Clearly you do care about it, but what I am saying is that you 
shouldn't. If you don't like what they are doing, then move on. Forget them.</p>
<p>And please, don't imply that I am blind to the flaws about it being 
&quot;underpowered&quot;. Or that I am arrogant and delusional, or a cock who 
makes s**tty comments. I don't insult you so please extend me the same 
courtesy. I recognize that Wii U might not be capable in some respects but 
neither do I believe that they could have gone in any other direction. They 
know that making their console powerful, whilst including the tablet, would 
have been costly and they know that many would not be willing to pay a high 
price for their console, especially with the world economy as it is now. They 
also know from experience that games sell consoles (sorry, I'm repeating 
myself), so they see making a powerful console as unnecessary. There are many 
developers that embrace that, there are others that do not. But that just means 
that Wii U has a home for some but not all developers. But from what they have 
said, many of them value a new way to present their games, so they appear to be 
behind it. Plus Nintendo themselves have communicated with developers to ensure 
that the console meets their needs. In a sense, they gave them what they wanted.

<p>The least powerful console certainly hasn't always sold the most. The SNES 
globally outsold the less powerful Megadrive. Disappointing 3D-graphics 
performance was THE main reason why the Saturn was crushed by newcomer Sony's 
Playstation. The Dreamcast had a high-quality software library (arguably better 
than PS2 in the early days), but the console sold dismally, as everybody 
skipped it and waited instead for the PS2, which was known to be more powerful 
and have wider third-party support.</p>
<p>Underpowered tech can really hurt a console's chances on the market, unless 
it's compensated by some other strong unique selling point - like the motion 
controls of the Wii or the additional touch-screen of the DS. I doubt that the 
Wii U's unique hardware features will be as strong and enough to compensate for 
low-spec tech this time around. But I wouldn't mind being proven wrong, as I'm 
still somewhat of a Nintendo fan, despite the Wii.</p> </li>

<p>In that case you should have a look at how your present yourself when

<p>And I haven't insulted you, I never called you a cock - I was talking about

then something's not quite right - either you can't take someone else's points

<p>You keep saying 'games sell consoles', and third party games are still 
games and are very important. Why is the 360 continuing to sell so well when 
it's non kinect exclusives have dried to a trickle? If 360 owners just relied 
on MS's games, they'd have next to f**k all to play! I haven't bought a non 
Nintendo game for my Wii for ages, in the mean time I've bought dozens on my 
PS3/360.</p>
<p>I don't want to not buy a Wii U, but similarly I don't want to spend

<p>I love Nintendo a great deal - four of my top five games ever are on 
Nintendo consoles and few things get me as excited as a new Zelda or Metroid. 
My Wii has been fantastic in the last year with awesomeness like Xenoblade, The 
Last Story and Skyward Sword. What I'm saying is that of course I'm interested 
in the Wii U - in fact I'm certain to buy one. It's inevitable, and while I 
won't be able to buy one at launch I'll buy one as soon as I'm able. But there 
are a few things that I'm skeptical about. I'd rather not have the Wii U seen 
as the odd one out and miss on games due to being less powerful, and I'm still 
doubtful over how good the resistive touchscreen will be. But in all honesty, 
two small words had me sold on Nintendo's next console before it was even 
announced:</p>
<p>Zelda HD.</p> </li>

<p>Watch PlayValue on UStudio regarding your first paragraph. That is was my 
original source of information. Regarding the second one, I agree with you that 
a weaker console requires a unique feature, as well as good games to show it 
off, and Nintendo knows that. They received a lot of criticism last year for 
their Wii U reveal, including my own; my original words were &quot;what a pile 
of crap&quot; I believe. But it is their resolve to try and impress the world 
and do something different that impresses me. Perhaps they will live up to my 
original criticism, perhaps they will be a revolution in gaming, but what 
irritates me is people dismissing them without having even let their horse out 
of the stable.</p> </li>

<p>I'm going to start off with an apology then. I never intended for my

<p>As for the &quot;cocks who post bulls**t&quot; part, I thought you were

others opinions though so please do not think otherwise. I have taken on board 
what you have said and I respect that there are some people that feel that way 
about Wii U, but I believe that most people will be able to overlook or even 
not consider said concerns.</p>
<p>Regarding the 360 comment. People bought them for their solid exclusives 
and even though those exclusives have dried up, there are still a solid 
selection of third party platform games being released to entice new buyers. 
That, and it being considerably cheaper than the PS3 so naturally it will 
continue to sell. However, the PS3 has become more alluring the last couple of 
years thanks to its cheaper price and exclusives. It isn't the power of the PS3 
which is causing it to sell more. It is the two key words &quot;price and 
games&quot;. As for my Wii collection, it is predominantly made up of third 
party titles; I very rarely buy a first party title. I don't know why I 
mentioned that lol.</p>
<p>Look, in the end, you might want a Wii U, you might not, the same applies 
to me. But if you don't like what you see, then don't buy it. If you do like 
it, then buy it. But I believe that we should all keep an open mind until we 
actually know what Nintendo has planned for us. Don't get annoyed with them

<p>I understand your concerns regarding the console, but as you mentioned, you 
will still get one, even if it's just for Zelda HD. If you want more power (I'm 
not saying you do)then buy a PS4/720 too when they are released. You get the 
joy of the Nintendo games you love on a relatively cheap console, and can enjoy 
other games on other consoles. I can see that a lot of people are sceptical of 
Wii U because they clearly have a soft spot for Nintendo, they are fearful of 
the future of the company they care about. But have more faith in them. They 
are a company that has endured. If Wii U fails then so be it, but they will 
always find a way back into people's lives, one way or another. p.s. I am sorry 
if I sounded arrogant at any point in my comment. It seems to be an issue of 
mine.</p> </li>

<p>I got confused. What I remember hearing on PlayValue was that the most 
powerful console always came last in sales, not that the weakest console always 
won. Such a simple mistake changes the whole argument. Things like 3DO, N64, 
Xbox, PS3 and the like. And yes, I agree that the Wii would have sold 
considerably less had it not used motion control. I often wonder what it would 
have been like had they entered the standard controller HD era alongside the 
360 and PS3. I think they knew it wouldn't have worked out well for them.</p>
