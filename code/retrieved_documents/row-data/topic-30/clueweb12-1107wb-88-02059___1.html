colt parker replied to Greg Zebolsky's 
discussion '?????Any Info &amp; Pics On Installing On/Off Button?????'  &quot;i 
would also like to see these made (for the v3.0 board).&nbsp; as far as the 
materials, radioshack should have most of what you need.&nbsp; i found the name 
of the button that some other company uses on their modded controllers, and 
where to order&hellip;&quot;<br>

commented on Sam Pham's blog post 'My Intensafiire Isn't Working Right'  
&quot;sounds like you may have a CG controller which are the hardest to get a 
good connection on just that middle pin of the sync button. Did you use the 
glue?&quot;<br>

that content too and just to give you a heads up it'll cost you $160 just to 
make an XCM, V2 Intensafire, LED Thumbstick Controller. Oh and i have 2 of them 
lol. Not to mention both&hellip;&quot;<br>
