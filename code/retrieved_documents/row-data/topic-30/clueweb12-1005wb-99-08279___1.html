<p>By Mike Jackson for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Microsoft has made Kinect voice and motion control a necessary requirement 
for all new Xbox apps.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 According to Kotaku, Microsoft has confirmed that anyone wishing 
to publish their content on Xbox will need to include controls for that little 
sensor bar before it's given a green light.
<p></p> 
<p>  This is clearly a sign of MS further enforcing the importance of Kinect 
in its operations going forward.</p> 
<p>It's also good for universal intuitiveness. The new Xbox dashboard arrived 
earlier this week, bringing with it revamped apps for all the previously 
available Xbox services such as Netflix. These new apps now adopt menus in line 
with the dashboard itself, bringing an intuitive sense of unity to the whole 
system.</p>

<p>the new dash seems to work pretty well when using Kinect, the only issue 
with it though is that you have to keep your hand in place for to long while 
the circle fills in for it to accept the instruction, it seems to take about 
five seconds but that takes to long when it takes less than a second to click 
when using the normal gamepad, just some edit function would be ok where you 
can adjust the amount of time it takes.</p> </li>

<p>Are small devs - like the people who made Castle Crashers - going to want 
to bother with stuff like this?</p> </li>

<p>This is the No 1 reason why I use my PS3 more now than ever.</p>
<p>Kinect should not be forced upon you, it should be optional, just like move 
on PS3.</p>
<p><br>
I've had a 360 since 2007 and enjoyed it but if this happens I'll be 
leaving Xbox for good.</p> </li>

<p>Sometimes people on this forum are on Daily Mail levels. Apps requiring 
Kinect functionality doesn't mean users need to have Kinect. It means that MS 
have minimum requirements for the user interface that the developer must meet. 
So what they are doing is making sure Kinect users have an experience that is 
consistent and well designed. HOW DARE THRY! Insisting that a group of their 
customers isn't sidelined and that their new product is properly integrated 
into their existing systems? EVIL!!!</p>
<p>If a new console, game or service comes out no one complains about it bein 
&quot;rammed down their throat&quot; bit, apparently MS making a unified Kinect 
ready experience is somehow a bad thing. That attitude is no more informed than 
someone who half reads a report on brain waves and video games and goes into a 
righteous rage. THINK OF THE CHILDREN, WON'T SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE 
CHILDREN.</p>
<p>The number of new services on offer and the quality of the interface are 
astounding. Fine the exclusives are drying up but, that started ages before 
Kinect came along. Just now you can blame it on their Kinect focus...</p> </li>

<p>This! It's been an absolute joy to use the new GUI with Kinect voice 
commands; it is genuinely state of the art which ain't bad on a console that's 
on it's seventh birthday. People on here, and a lot of gamers in general 
actually, act as if any changes to consoles that don't involve beefing up 
hardware specs or frame rates are the work of the devil, pedophiles and Bobby 
Kotick working together in some kind of coven. No, Kinect ain't great as a game 
controller by itself and it is definitely overpriced but it is a great way to 
navigate menus and get more from your console experience.</p>
<p>Microsoft aren't forcing you to buy it or use it, they're just making sure 
developers are including functionality for it for the people who have splashed 
out on one and in such are rewarding their customers by ensuring full 
functionality of the product.</p>
<p>Oh and I bet my 30 hours spent in Dark Souls that everyone who put a 
negative comment on here has not used Kinect with the latest update and are 
therefore officially talking out of their arse.</p> </li> </ol>
