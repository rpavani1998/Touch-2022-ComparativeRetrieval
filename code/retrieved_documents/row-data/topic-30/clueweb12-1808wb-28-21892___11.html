<h1><strong>Xbox Shopping FAQ</strong></h1> <br>
 Considering to buy an Xbox? 
This page answers frequently asked questions (FAQ) and may help you decide 
which items are essential and what to look out for. If a question related to 
buying the Xbox online is not answered in this FAQ, please feel free tosend 
your inquiry to us. <br>
<br>
 Click here for the latest shopping news for the 
Xbox 360. <i>We thank our mascot, The Austrian Snowtiger&trade; who kindly 
agreed to model for our Xbox photo shoot.</i> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4>Can the Xbox play DVD movies?</h4>  Yes it can - however, you need to buy 
theXbox DVD Movie Playback Kit which includes the hardware and the driver, and 
also an infrared DVD remote control. Without it, the Xbox does NOT play DVDs 
but uses its DVD drive only for the games. Some retailers sell Xbox bundles 
with the DVD kit included. If you already have a good DVD player at home, you 
don't really need to spend the extra money for the DVD kit. If you don't have a 
DVD player yet, then the DVD kit is a good investment.<i>For the techies: 
Please note that the Xbox cannot playback DVD movies in progressive scan. 
(Neither can the Playstation 2 nor most stand-alone DVD players).</i> If you 
wish to play DVDs from other countries, refer to ourDVD region codes 
information. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h4>Does the Xbox have good games?</h4>  Yes! Clearly, the value of any video 
game system is determined by the quality of the games for it. The Xbox has been 
released with a long list of excellent games, and this list is growing rapidly. 
One of the launch games, theXbox shooting game &quot;Halo&quot; has certainly 
set new standards for its genre. There are also a large number of excellent
racing games, sports games and many other games available.  Snowtiger&trade; 
recommends Halo, Max Payne and Dead or Alive 3 as his favorite Xbox games.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>

<h4>Do I need to buy a controller?</h4>  No. The Xbox controller is included 
when you buy an Xbox console. However, many games feature multiplayer options, 
and the real fun begins when you play with or against a human opponent, making 
a second controller a good investment.<br>
<br>
 The Xbox controller has 
built-in vibration feedback, most of its buttons are fully analog for precision 
control, and it houses the ports for the Xbox memory cards.<br>
<br>
 The 
Japanese Xbox controller is designed for smaller hands and is compatible with 
US Xbox consoles. It is difficult to obtain a Japanese controller in the U.S.
<br><br>
 The cable that connects the controller to the xbox has a 
safety-release built-in, so you won't pull your Xbox off the table when you 
trip over the controller cable (as I frequently do). <br>
 Snowtiger&trade; 
loves fighting games (especially with girls in cat-suits...) <br>
<br>
<br>

<h4>What about the Xbox Controller S?</h4>  This is an American version of the 
smaller Japanese controller. The newController S is available now and costs the 
same as the regular Xbox controller. Microsoft sources say that it will not be 
included in Xbox bundles. The controller S is different from the Japanese 
controller as it has a longer cable (almost 10 ft) and the springs in the 
triggers are different. Click here toread more about Controller S. <br>

<h4> Can I use my Playstation 2 controller with the Xbox?</h4>  Yes! With the 
Xbox Dreambox Converter you can connect your favourite PlayStation or 
PlayStation 2 controller to your Xbox console. It supports vibration function 
plus features a memory card slot for saving game data. A great accessory for 
owners of both systems. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h4> Are there extension cords available for the Xbox controller?</h4>  Find 
the Xbox controller cord a tad short? So do we! But now there is a solution! The
Xbox Extension Cable extends the length of the Xbox controller cord by 2 meters.
<br> <br>
<br>

<h4>Can I get a steering wheel for the Xbox?</h4>  Yes. If you like driving 
games, then you already know that real bliss can be enjoyed with a dedicated 
steering wheel. The accessory manufacturer MadCatz offers anXbox Steering Wheel 
and other manufacturers have announced their plans to offer steering wheels too.
<br> <br>

<h4>Do I need to buy a memory card?</h4>  Not really. The xbox console has a 
large 8 GB harddisk built-in, which is used to save game information etc. Thus, 
anXbox memory card is really only useful to transport your saved game data to 
another Xbox, eg. when visiting a friend. Unlike the PS2, the Xbox's memory 
card is not an essential item, and in fact you may never need one.<br>
<br>

<h4> What kind of accessories exist for the Xbox?</h4>  The typical range, 
includingXbox cables and adapters (quite popular in this range is the 
controller extension cable!), bags and cases, controllers, steering wheels... 
<br> <br>

<h4>Can I play PC games on the Xbox?</h4>  No. The Xbox is not compatible with 
games developed for the PC and vice versa. You can only play games developed 
specifically for the Xbox.<br>
<br>
 Similarly, you cannot use PC peripherals 
on the Xbox. Although the Xbox has a USB socket, the plug is slightly different 
(and non-standard) and wont fit.  Right: Snowtiger&trade; is unimpressed and 
presents us his backside.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4>Does the Xbox have better graphics than a high-powered PC?</h4>  Yes - 
although the CPU of the Xbox is slower than some high-end PCs, andPC video cards
 are being developed that match the power of the Nvidia graphics in the Xbox, 
the Xbox may still produce better and faster graphics because it is not slowed 
down by the PC operating system environment. Naturally, with time more and more 
powerful graphics cards and faster CPUs are being developed, and thus it is 
only a matter of time until PC hardware and corresponding PC computer games 
exist that can outperform the Xbox hardware.<br>
<br>

<h4> Can I connect my Xbox to a PC monitor?</h4>  Yes - there is a special 
Xbox VGA Adapter available that enables to connect your Xbox console to any VGA 
monitor.<br>
<br>

<h4> Can I get a real RGB signal out of my Xbox?</h4>  Yes. We have dedicated 
a separate article to this issue: OurXbox RGB Scart FAQ deals with component 
video, NTSC/PAL issues and RGB Scart. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h4> Does the Xbox have HDTV support?</h4>  Yes it does. You need to purchase 
theHigh Definition AV Cable. The standard xbox only comes with standard A/V 
(RCA) cables. You need the advanced A/V cable or the HD cable if you want to 
get Dolby Digital Sound, because only these cables have a socket to connect an 
optical digital audio cable.<br>
<br>
 Please note that the Xbox does not have 
separate audio outputs - it has only one combined AV port. You need a special 
Xbox cable either way, ie. the standard RCA one that comes with the Xbox or a 
special one to get higher quality video signals and the digital audio. Read 
more about component video and HDTV for the Xbox in ourXbox RGB Scart article. 
<br> The Austrian Snowtiger (TM) is impressed with the HDTV output of Dead or 
Alive 3. <br>
<br>
 If you're considering to get a HDTV or are interested in 
Home Cinema Systems with Dolby Digital Surround Sound, we recommend to have a 
look atsonystyle.com. <br>
<br>

<h4> What about Sony Playstation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube?</h4>  The PS2 and 
the Gamecube are very powerful video game consoles. In terms of graphics and 
power, they can't match the Xbox, but they have other advantages. The choice 
which system to buy is ultimately a personal one. Read more about the great 
debate here:Xbox vs Gamecube vs PS2. <br>
<br>

<h4> Which retailer to buy from?</h4>  Psreporter.com lists only reputable 
online retailers. Shopping at any of the listed sites is safe. The choice were 
to buy should be decided upon the particular bundle, and perhaps the individual 
retailer's shipping conditions. The prices for the actual Xbox console don't 
differ that much. There was a dramaticXbox price drop in May 2002, and now the 
invidual Xbox console costs only$149.99. Bundle offers that contain console, 
games and accessories usually can save you some money, compared to buying the 
items individually. Since the Xbox (and the box it comes in) is fairly large, 
expect additional costs for shipping.  Right: Snowtiger poses on the rather 
large Xbox box.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4> Are the UK and U.S. Xboxes compatible?</h4>  No. You cannot play US games 
on aUK console and vice versa. Same goes for DVDs because of the DVD region 
encoding. However, an Xbox mod chip is now available that circumvents this 
problem.<br>
