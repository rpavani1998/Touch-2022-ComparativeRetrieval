<p>By Tamoor Hussain for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Networking-savvy gamers have figured out a way to disable the adverts in 
the latest Xbox 360 Dashboard overhaul.</p> 
<p>360 users seem quite fond of the new-look Dashboard, but one major gripe on 
the forums points to the prominence given to adverts, and in particular how 
they take priority over the games and content.</p> 
<p>  Searching for a solution, the proactive users on Reddit have taken 
matters into their own hands and blocked 'rad.msn.com', the server Microsoft 
uses to beam ads to the 360.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 The first method involves blocking the domain through your 
router, which will throw up a 404 if you try and access it from a PC. 
Alternatively you can use OpenDNS, a free service which can block specific 
sites.
<p></p> 
<p>Here's how to do it (using this method will require you to re-download 
title updates):</p> 
<ol> 
<li><em>Sign up for a free OpenDNS account.<br>
<br>
</em></li> 
<li><em>Add a network for your current IP address.<br>
<br>
</em></li> 
<li><em>Go to Advanced Settings and next to 'Domain Typos', check the box 
'Enable typo correction' if it's not already checked and apply.<br>
<br>
</em>
</li> 
<li><em>Go to Web Content Filtering settings and set the filtering level to 
'None', and under 'Manage individual domains', put rad.msn.com and select 
'Always block' and then click 'Add domain'. Screenshot.<br>
<br>
</em></li> 
<li><em>On your Xbox, go to System Settings -&gt; Network Settings -&gt; (your 
connection) -&gt; Configure Network -&gt; DNS settings -&gt; Manual, and enter 
the OpenDNS IP addresses for the primary and secondary DNS servers: 
208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220.<br>
<br>
</em></li> 
<li><em>You may need to clear your hard drive cache before ads disappear 
entirely: System Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Hard Drive -&gt; press Y -&gt; 
Clear System Cache (note that you'll have to re-download any title updates for 
any games you play after doing this).</em></li> </ol> 
<p>We haven't tried any of this, so we can't guarantee that it works or that 
it doesn't mess with your online gaming/other network services. Use at your own 
risk folks.</p> <br>

<p>I had a quick flick through and can't say the ads got in my way - I 
actually don't remember any of them apart from that bird from IGN, and I 
assumed it was those s**tty gameplay videos they do. I pay for plenty of things 
that still have ads, it's just the way of the world now unfortunately - at 
least they're not ads in front of content - i.e watch a 30 second ad in order 
to watch a 30 second trailer, &aacute; la CVG.</p>
<p>I like the way it moves, but the arrangement is a bit all over the place. 
But I spend such a small amount of time navigating the dashboard, I don't 
really care too much.</p>
<p>Having gaming about the 4th option along is a bit odd, but I guess if you 
play a few XBLA titles and you've got the game in your drive, you'll be able to 
get to it from the 'Quick Play' section, or whatever it's called.</p>
<p>Don't think MS can ban anyone for settings on their router, but you never 
know with these companies!</p> </li>

<p>This really needs doing, the new dash is a f**king travesty. I thought I've 
give it a few days of trying to use it before I hated it, and now I really do 
hate it.</p>
<p>I don't have kinect, that doesn't really bother me, but its just a big 
scrolling advert for things that I will never want. I tried looking for the IGN 
strategise about Skyrim last night (now that I've got Skyrim cheap) but the 
video archive has just vanished.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to change my motto to 'Dashboard=Gashboard', but I couldn't 
find how to change it.</p>
<p>So unless I buy kinect and spend all my time drooling thinking 'Ooo fingys 
moving magic ooo!' like some sort of idiotic ape, its just a massive pain in 
the arse.</p>
<p>If anyone knows where the video archive is or how I alter my profile or who 
I can punch in the face about this, please let me know.</p> </li>

Yes, but you don't pay for CVG or to watch any of its movies. </p>
<p>Every other online service I can think of uses the mantra &quot;If its free 
there'll be adverts, if you pay for the service we remove the ads&quot;

<p>Granted, your example above is annoying, especially if the advert is for 
the same game as the one in the trailer - preaching to the choir so to speak.

<p>It was just an example of the vids really. Although I simply won't watch 
short vids on CVG because of it. But that's another story!</p>
<p>I get what you're saying, and if the above happened it would be a step too 
far for a subscription service. As it is I personally don't find them intrusive 
as they take a split second to skip past and it's not like (as far as I'm 
aware) they pop up at other times, or inside your game library etc.</p> </li>

<p>The ads would annoy me more if they hadn't at least sorted out that when 
you boot up, it finally starts you on the &quot;start disc in tray&quot; option 
so you can just press A and get going if you don't want to check the store or 
anything. Personally I don't mind ads that much anyway, as long as they're for 
game content on the 360. It's when they're unrelated I get annoyed.</p>
<p>Currently it's the new friends list and party menus which are more of a 
pain to navigate around.</p> </li>

<p>wait so you'll have a go at MS for selling ad space on live. But still have 
a PS3 a console that has had features removed for the sake of profit, Has had 
games with ads actually in them while it loads. and by a company that'd rather 
sue its own customers and attack the homebrew community rather than allow them 
to have any kind of control over their own hardware. and never admits to 
defects within its hardware and only offers a 3 month warrenty on its consoles.
</p>
<p>As aposed to MS that has added features with each revision, Has extended 
its warrenty pretty much indefinately to faults with the hardware they owned up 
to and has given the homebrew community the tools to be able to create and sell 
games on the 360s marketplace.</p>
<p>If you're going to play the evil coroporation card it pays to think about 
the ones that you're currently backing.</p> </li>

<p>I just flicked through the dashboard, and there are ads for Peugeot in the 
bottom right corner of three of the sections. The rest are ads for content 
within that section, which as far as I can see is fair enough. I get the same 
as the latter on my PS3 in places, and I really don't care about that either.
</p>
<p>Until it actually starts to get in the way of me finding and getting what I 
want, there are far bigger issues in this industry to get p**sed at - DRM, the 
quality of games out of the box, pricing, not enough games using dedicated 
servers, on disc DLC, the value of DLC and GoD, the way one time codes are used 
in games like Arkham or EA's annual releases likes FIFA, NFS etc.</p>
<p>Would I prefer no ads? Of course, but they're less intrusive than ads you 
see in papers, TV etc. I'm guessing doing this workaround will give you a blank 
tile in the bottom corner of some sections, to me that makes absolutely zero 
difference.</p>
<p>They've totally buried Indie games though - you have to go through about 
three button presses just to get to them. That's pretty s**tty, although I 
guess if you have Kinect you can 'Bing' it. Bing.... it's never going to catch 
on MS.</p> </li>

<p>It wasn't exactly an uphill struggle without kinect, was it? Now finding 
anything that has to do with gaming is, though. I could easily ignore the ads 
if it wasn't for the features that seem to have vanished. Try searching for 
'IGN Strategise' on bing. It just vomits up a load of random s**t. Its pathetic.

<p>Really this should have been the announcement of Platinum as a &pound;40 a 
year service that blocks the ads and because they're using adverts knock the 
rrp price of Gold down to &pound;20-30, for that I wouldn't mind adverts. 
That's the one thing about the dash I don't like Microsoft will profit but the 
only thing gamers get is cloud saving which should be in with the subscriptions 
anyway not paid for by adverts.</p> </li>

<p>Don't get me wrong Sony have broken more consumer rights laws than you can

<p>So trust me, as a PS3 Linux user and a member of the PS3 modding scene I 
probably know more than you on the subject.</p>
<p>But the difference is as simple as this: For right or for wrong Sony done 
these things in defence. Now I'm not saying that I agree with their methods 
(you probably can guess my stance from the links), but it's still defence.</p>
<p>MS screw their customers as default and not as the result of being 
attacked. What do you think they would do if they were attacked?<br>
I'm not 
going to go down the road of listing all the faults of MS and their breaches of 
consumer rights with the Xbox platform alone (unless that's really what you 
want).<br>
Most of the scene now use two PS3's. One for PSN access, and one for 
modding. So the whole thing is a moot point, as no one has been sued and Sony 
leave the scene alone now even though it's pretty lively.</p> </li>

<p>I don't think it is against the TOS. The TOS only covers modifications made 
to the console and the live service it's self. It does not cover anything about 
configuring your router to block adverts.</p> </li>

<p>Granted, your example above is annoying, especially if the advert is for 
the same game as the one in the trailer - preaching to the choir so to speak.

<p>Which is precisely what I'm doing (i.e. not paying for a Gold account). 
This is yet another reason not to cave in to MS blatant extortion scheme, and 
since online gaming on my Xbox 360 means nothing to me, I really don't perceive 
myself to be at a loss.</p> </li>

<p>I hate the dashboard in general. Why can't they just have all the 
marketplace items in one place and use a simple menu system like the second 
dashboard update ( the nice blue one) The new one is like a god dam cheap porn 
site spammed with unappealing BUY NOW!!! tacky video adverts everywhere.</p>

<p>wait so you'll have a go at MS for selling ad space on live. But still have 
a PS3 a console that has had features removed for the sake of profit, Has had 
games with ads actually in them while it loads. and by a company that'd rather 
sue its own customers and attack the homebrew community rather than allow them 
to have any kind of control over their own hardware. and never admits to 
defects within its hardware and only offers a 3 month warrenty on its consoles.
</p> 
<p>As aposed to MS that has added features with each revision, Has extended 
its warrenty pretty much indefinately to faults with the hardware they owned up 
to and has given the homebrew community the tools to be able to create and sell 
games on the 360s marketplace.</p> 
<p>If you're going to play the evil coroporation card it pays to think about 
the ones that you're currently backing.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Do you mean the same Microsoft that only acknowledged the &quot;three red 
lights error&quot; (or RROD as MS hate it to be commonly known as) after 
essentially being forced into it by various governments, courts, and consumer 
watchdogs EIGHTEEN MONTHS after reports of it first emerged? The same Microsoft 
that will accuse you of moving the 360 or placing it in a location with 
&quot;microscopic vibrations&quot; and will simply refuse to believe you if 
your 360 is abnormally loud or scratching your discs (with no possibility of 
repair or disc replacement)? The same Microsoft that have, in the majority of 
cases, renamed the E74 error to E82 on the slim and provide only the standard 
warranty nowadays?</p>
<p>If so, you need to be educated. Yes... I'm whoring this out again.<br>

<p>This may be part of the reason why people are viewing the ps3 as an 
&#147;upgrade&#147;.</p>
<p>Tbh, the only time I&#145;ll tolerate ads is on a free android game 
I&#145;ve downloaded. However, if I like the game I&#145;ll normally upgrade to 
the paid ad-free version. </p> </li>

<p>lol wow! so microsoft are already the only ones in the industry charging 
for services everybody else provides for free, but now they're putting adverts 
on said service? no wonder microsoft are losing footing with all their online 
services to the likes of google and facebook when their thinking is so 
backwards.</p>
<p>so we got a choice, a paid for service with ads. or a free service with no 
ads. anybody else see how backwards this is? </p> </li>

<p>I absolutely despise the new dashboard. Apart from the fact since they got 
rid of the blades everything has become ridiculously brighter than white with 
each subsequent Xmb update (which as a daily migraine sufferer this is not 
good), the very first thing you see upon booting up is an advert for possibly 
the worst game of all time...f***ing Fifa. Every single tab is plastered with 
adverts (most of which have nothing to do with gaming), and yet the essential 
things the console uses (like er, I don't know, GAMES tabs) are buried and very 
difficult to see, and are also a quarter of the size of the adverts. The 
&quot;Games&quot; section on the Ui is now in the middle of the scroll bar at 
the top - says it all really. Considering the 360 is a GAMES console I would 
have thought that should be the very first thing you would see and take 
priority over everything else no? As a PAYING GOLD ACCOUNT USER I shouldn't 
have to see any adverts whatsoever, let alone ones that are completely 
irrelevant like deodorant, car ads, etc. This really annoyed me in the last 
couple of xmb's and has been getting steadily worse and is a major reason why I 
took the decision not to renew my gold account when it runs out very soon. As a 
free Silver account user I would expect to see some advertising, but as a Gold 
member (for now) this is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>At least with the Ps3 when you first boot the machine up it starts on the 
&quot;games&quot; tab and the other tabs are all relevant and have no 
advertising, which is the way it should be. Funnily enough, I never thought I'd 
say it but out of all the current consoles I think the Wii has the best Ui 
currently. The very first tile you see is the games tile, which as a games 
console first and foremost I would expect to see. The rest of the tiles are 
useful, such as the BBC I-Player, Web Browser and Online Store and there is no 
advertising whatsoever. Ninty may not have the most powerful console, and true 
there is a rubbish skip load of shovelware for their machine, but they sure 
know how to design a menu system and not p*** off their customers. Its funny 
how both the Wii and Ps3 are free to use online too, yet the only system (360) 
people actually pay a subscription to play online and use some other features 
(like the Sky player) is rammed to the s***load with non related adverts. When 
this generation of consoles started I was all for Ms new console, having owned 
an original Xbox beforehand and loved every minute of it, but its clear their 
priority's have changed, shoving s*** Kinnect down your throat and a million, 
streaming, bandwidth sucking adverts in your face. If this keeps up next gen I 
don't think I'll bother getting the next Ms console unless something rapidly 
changes between now and then.</p>

<p>I must say I'm very surprised at the reaction here, but fair play to those 
who feel taken advantage of. This isn't me 'bending over for the man' or 
anything like that, just a difference in priorities I suppose.</p>
<p>I agree the Wii does have the best interface (I actually can't stand the 
flow of the xmb, and not having a proper 'mini XMB' in game, plus it's not 
viewable against certain themes, and MS are putting more and more focus on non 
gaming content) because, no matter what people think of it, it's the only pure 
games console out there. I'd rather not have any of the other s**t on consoles. 
I do like Lovefilm and iplayer, but I don't actually want to be 'sold' anything 
that's not game related.</p>
<p>If the Wii U doesn't play films etc, I'll be more than happy. I have a PC 
to do multiple things - emulators, play music/video files, operating systems, 
my consoles are ultimately for playing my games on.</p> </li>

<p>The issue is charging a sub and still having ads. It's not a problem for me 
in it's current state, but I can see why people find it annoying to some degree.
