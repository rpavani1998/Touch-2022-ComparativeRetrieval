<p>We reckon there's a little bit of Epic Games that regrets inventing that 
chainsaw gun.</p> 
<p> Since the series' comparatively humble beginnings pandering to the macho 
shooter crowd (even more so than now), the boys and girls behind the carnage 
have grown. They've matured beyond Schwarzenegger-calibre dialogue and mindless 
set-pieces and developed some genuinely interesting characters, wrapped in a 
low key yet personal and compelling plot.</p> 
<p>But still the Heavy Rain snobs will be put off by that big, blood-soaked 
gun on the front of the box. And they're missing out.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Gears of War 3 is the best campaign story Epic Games has ever made. It's 
got everything you'd want; laughs, tragedy - and there's even a bit of Tears 
for Fears hidden in there at the back. It's a stellar compilation of everything 
the developer's learnt from five years of hugely acclaimed instalments, and 
polished to perfection thanks to an extra year in construction.</p> 
<p>Yet after 20 hours nailing our active reloads and effortlessly murdering 
boss characters with three online wingmen, a niggling question remains. Has 
Gears of War 3's 'wow' factor been killed off by its own impressive 
predecessors?</p> 
<h3>FRIENDS TILL THE END</h3> 
<p>Gears 3's campaign is the same, spectacular stuff you've come to expect 
from the studio whose engine has become synonymous with triple-A games 
throughout the generation. The battles are big, the environments gorgeous and 
every now and then somebody says &quot;f***&quot; as a nasty looking baddy 
smashes through the nearside wall.</p> 
<p>The difference is, this time, Epic's had an extra year to ferment its 
engine juices, which means more polish and less filler - even if it does insist 
on (briefly) revisiting the vehicle sections we've begged it to stop making 
since the original.</p> 
<p>Gear's most notable maturity is its disregard for the mindless set-pieces 
that once plagued the series. Gears of War 2, while unquestionably upping the 
ante over Number One with armies of Locust foot soldiers and skyscraper-sized 
critters, loved a good turret section or aforementioned vehicle atrocity. Gears 
of War 3 has grown up and ditched the obsession.</p> 
<p>Instead it maintains the entertainment factor via a constant stream of 
variety; in one mission you might be fighting off Locust goons on a boat, the 
next you're down to base weapons in the jungle and fending off a pack of 
Tickers attempting to run off with ammo and pick-ups between their fangs.</p> 
<p>And you'll do it all in some of the series' most interesting locations to 
date, ranging from sun-kissed beaches to an (American) football stadium and the 
mass grave of a fire-bombed human city.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 Following a refreshingly outlandish introduction sequence (with 
far less testosterone that you'd expect from a Gears opener), the story - 
penned by acclaimed British sci-fi author Karen Traviss - picks up two years 
after the last game's apocalyptic conclusion, with Marcus, Dom and co held up 
on an old warship, sailing the ocean and growing crops in a desperate attempt 
to simply carry on living.
<p></p> 
<p>As you'll remember from the closing scenes of their last adventure however, 
the planet Sera has been far from cleansed of underground nasties. In fact 
there's a new enemy faction in town; the glowing, mutated Lambent that enjoy 
nothing more than appearing out of the ground via gigantic enemy-spewing stalks 
- and they're about to rock the boat (literally in this case).</p>

<p>I know many will say this is pointless but secretly we love comparisons if 
we have a preference console gaming and when Uncharted 3 is released, its 
inevitable that declarations of who really owns the king of third person 
shooters will emerge and I can't wait. Wasn't a big fan of the first Gears game 
but the second won me over with hig set pieces and gorgeous looks. Number 3 
looks like fine tuning and polishing that formula even more plus the locus are 
an ace ememy as it is without the Flood like Lament, it all makes me want an 
Xbox 360 <br>
For those with both consoles, get the bestof both worlds. For PC 
gamers with no consoles, they lose out.</p> </li>

<p>Excellent point, it'd probably be better to say that GoW popularised 
cover-shooter mechanics, as kill.switch certainly outdates it. Hell, the over 
the shoulder perspective so favoured by third-person shooters these days owes 
much to Resi 4 too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I might pick this up eventually, I still haven't got round to 
completing the first one, and I'll be prioritising Skyrim and Arkham City soon 
(not to mention the fact I'm busy going through Inazuma Eleven and the retail 
version of the Monkey Island collection).</p> </li>

<p>I'm sure the reviews are all going to be pretty good, and I'm glad to hear 
about a meaty campaign and I'm very much looking forward to getting it.</p>
<p>I don't think you can expect to get those extra high scores (i.e. 9.5 etc) 
on the third game in four/five years in a series where the game hasn't really 
changed very much and you're just shooting slightly different enemies in 
environments that look slightly different.</p>
<p>I think the same will apply to Uncharted 3.</p> </li>

<p>My mate had about 40 mins on Horde and Beast mode today at the NEC (he's a 
manager at Game) and he says it is f**king epic, which isn't bad considering he 
didn't play the previous 2 much. He also had 30 mins on BF and said, well, I 
won't say as it may be controversial </p> </li>

<p>I don't know. I'm willing to bet that Uncharted 3 will have a higher review 
average on Metacritic than Gears 3.<br>

than Gears.)</p> </li>

<p>Maybe it will, but I don't think we'll see the dizzyingly high scores of 
UC2 - that's what I was getting at.</p>
<p>I may be wrong, they may have brought a lot more to it, but neither of 
these games are particularly exceptional in terms of gameplay - very good, 
solid games but gameplay wise they're not top of the tree for me (although I do 
love my co-op games). It's hard to change these games too much without loosing 
what makes them what they are, but I personally can't realistically rate a game 
that little bit higher that makes it GOTY type stuff when it's the basically 
the third instalment of a very similar game.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we should just rate games on their own efforts and 
forget what came before.</p> </li>

<p>@ricflair</p>
<p>You're probably right to be fair. In most cases, the third time that a game 
repeats the same formula it tends not to be met with quite as much enthusiasm, 
despite how well it might pull off the old tricks, as you say (with some 
notable exceptions: especially MGS3, which ALWAYS felt fresh despite keeping 
the same basic gameplay mechanics). But I just think Uncharted 3 could be an 
exceptional case - it really does look unbelievable, and I have complete faith 
that Naughty Dog will provide the goods. Also just to be clear... if I had an 
xbox I would be picking Gears 3 up, no doubt. I'm not slagging it off, it looks 
great. Very much looking forward to playing co-op on my brother's 360.</p> </li>

<p>This looks like another good Gears title as expected but I'm pretty sure

<p>Looks like great news for fans. Seems a tad harsh to crack down on it 
merely for preserving the simple unbutchered and slightly refined gameplay fans 
demanded. There were practically riots when they added the Retro and Sawn-Off  
Hope you apply the same rules to reviewing the other big titles of this year if 
that's the way you're playing it, it's a fair enough point and deserves to be 
brought up.</p> </li>

<p>Gears of War 3 is the most impressive game graphically I've ever seen on a 
console!</p>
<p>But more importantly, it's the high-quality game play that makes me want to 
play the game as soon as possible!</p>
<p>In particular, 4-player Co-Op in the Online Campaign is what will make the 
game super fun and give it unlimited replay value. Going back and earning all 
those Achievements with 4-players at a time is what gaming is all about -- FUN!
</p>
<p>The way the Horde mode uses so much strategy now provides incredibly deep 
game play. The Beast mode is the same thing; it gives unlimited replay value.
</p>
<p>Gears of War 3 is AWESOME!</p>
<p>I noticed Wal-Mart has it so you can get the game for $60 and you get a $20 
gift card. I think Amazon has that same deal. So you basically are getting 
Gears of War 3 for only $40!!!!!</p>
<p>If you buy the game from Gamestop you get a special version of Dom called 
Commando Dom as a special character if you preorder. So go preorder!</p> </li>

I agree beast mode is too easy although the ability to use corpsers, 
berskerkers and savage boomers is a recent highlight in gaming for me. One 
thing I did notice though is when you finish the mode the achievement says 
'survived thefirst waves of beast mode' which may suggest there may be more on 
the way, perhaps as DLC??? Here's hoping</p>
<p>Also I think it has a difficulty level too, though I am so delighted with 
the whole game I haven't properly started paying attention </p> </li>
