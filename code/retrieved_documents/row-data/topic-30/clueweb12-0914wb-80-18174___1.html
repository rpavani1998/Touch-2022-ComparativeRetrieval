<p>By Gavin Ogden for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>BioWare has formed a new online team to create a Star Wars: Knight of the 
Old Republic massively multiplayer online game, EGM reports.</p> 
<p>No further details were reported in the rumour section of the US magazine 
but we've taped our fingers crossed. KOTOR is one of our favourite Star Wars 
games ever and the thoughts of an online MMO is, frankly, too much to take in.
</p> 
<p>  The magazine also reports on a few other BioWare-related rumours. The 
current PC-exclusive Dragon Age is coming to PS3 and the DS currently in 
development at the mega-studio looks to be from the Baldur's Gate franchise. 
They're all rumours at the moment but we'll keep you updated with any 
announcements.</p> 
<p>If you missed Monday's shock news, CVG exclusively reported that the firm's 
highly anticipated Xbox 360 RPG Mass Effect has been pushed back to September.

<p>anything Bioware touches, will turn to gold.<br>
strong though how theyre 
really pushed for time on Mass Effect, and there talking about a MMO KOTOR 
game? thay will take up a lot of time, plus we might have to pay Phantasy Star 
like money to play it. which I won't do!<br>
however, Bioware totally rocks!<br>
who says the 360 doesn't have RPGs?</p> </li>

<p>NOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>Don't turn it into another pay monthly game.</p>
<p>Just make the next game in the series. The first two were brilliant.</p>
<p>I refuse to pay for a game, pay for live and then pay a monthly fee to play 
it.</p>
<p>This was a game I really wanted to hear about. If this story is true, I've 
just lost all interest.</p>

<p>I don't know why people are saying 'NO' to this??? If this is done right 
this could be the best MMO ever made! I am a huge fan of the KOTOR games and 
would love to see a KOTOR MMO. I am thinking a mix of WOW,Guild Wars and EVE 
online (gotta have space battles in it FFS) also kinda of off topic a little 
but i played number 2 before number one (Mistake i know) and am just about to 
finish number one now but am stuck on the last fight with Malak! any tips of

<p>First of all, I think this news stinks.  I've read that article and it 
didn't convince me that it has<b>any</b> basis.</p>
<p>Secondly, if it would be only MMO then I'd say 'HELL NO! '. If there were a 
singleplayer part, at least as good as the earlier games and an MMO side of the 
game, I'll say ok. But I want a singleplayer KOTOR 3! An MMO could never be as 
good as a SP RPG.</p> </li>

<p>I desperately hope this news isn't true. I loathe MMORPGs with a passion, 
and the thought of one of my favourite developers wasting their skills, time, 
and money on some POS on-line game when they could be making a proper RPG (i.e. 
KotOR 3, *SINGLE PLAYER ONLY*) instead is a highly unpleasant one.</p>
<p>So please Bio, don't be stupid. MMORPGs are the domain of developers who 
are too lazy/talentless to come up with good storyline ideas and write decent 
dialogue. We know you are more than capable of both, so there really is no need 
for this.</p> </li>

<p>The sad thing about most MMORPGs is that they're just glorified co-op SP 
games (like NWN), but with lots of strangers running around. No one can really 
affect the world, however. There's so much untapped potential.</p>
<p>Say NO to MMO!</p> </li>

<p>Love the KOTOR universe and if this was done properly but for PC aswell 
this would rock. Getting a bit bored of WOW. Even if it was a single player 
version as long as it was bioware that done it i would be over the moon!</p>

<p>I loved the KOTOR games but making it into a MMO would ruin it for me. I 
thought that the best part of the past games was interacting with the rest of 
your party. I would spend hours just listening to their stories and 
backgrounds. In a MMO whos in your party? A 10 year old who thinks hes so great 
and knows everything about the game.<br>
Please keep it single player Bioware 
or atleast make it so that online is optional!</p> </li>

<p>NO! I liked the first two as they were... MMO's rarely have a decent story 
or anything like that... and if its pay montly i'll never by a title by bioware 
ever... Payin to play the game and online after buying it? It'll be worse than 
WoW...&pound;9 A MONTH?! I WANT SINGLE PLAYER...ONLY!!!</p> </li>

<p>Its true that most of the current mmorpgs tend to be quite shallow in game 
content, reyling instead on player interaction to satisfy gamers needs. But if 
anyone one can sort out this genre then Obsidian would be one of the two 
possible companys I would like to see do it (THQ the other one). The KOTOR 
games were excellent, and if Obsidian were able to transfer that kind of 
quality onto the online world then it would be a major coup.</p>
<p>And essentially there wouldnt be so much work involved as it would be an 
evolution rather than a game built from scratch, for me the UI, game and 
character mechanics were spot on in KOTOR 2 the skills systems and character 
development etc were and still are better than any other ive come across so 
far, with the possible exception of Fallout 2 which would be an equal.</p> </li>

<p>Something I've noticed is all the people saying no to this are most likely 
thinking this is a substitute for KotOR 3, it's not, this is a completely 
separate game, an online version of KotOR that will have hardly anything to do 
with the characters already in the KotOR games, KotOR 3 will still be made and 
by Obsidian, though it's not official yet it's not that hard to see that 
Obsidian think that SW: KotOR is a goldmine, SW KotOR Online will be different, 
the story is practicaly made by the player and will be just basically a 
revamped SWG, but in the KotOR era, where there are more Sith and more Jedi, so 
i say definitely yes, this is what i have wanted since i first played KotOR 1, 
and also the people who don't want this, quite simply put, &quot;don't play 
it&quot; duh.</p> </li>

<p>Even if this MMORPG isn't &quot;instead of&quot; KotOR 3, it will still use 
up time and resources that could have gone into developing at least one single 
player game instead.</p>
<p>Although I love KotOR, I would much rather have a brand new single player 
RPG that has absolutely nothing to do with Star Wars than a KotOR MMORPG. Jade 
Empire 2, perhaps?</p> </li>

<h6>Crowlis on 26 Apr '07 said:</h6> 
<p>Ok yeah, they could use the time it would take for to make this for 
something else but, there are gonna be the millions of people who play online 
games (like me) that wants to play KotOR online, quite frankly it actually 
takes longer to make a single player RPG than it does to make an MMO, so time 
wise doesn't really matter as much, just think of it this way, its another 
KotOR game that just happens to be online, and if its better than SWG and WoW 
then i imagine it could be the best online game that could ever of been made, 
just because you don't want to pay money to play a game after you've already 
bought it doesn't mean it isn't good, or because you might not have a fast 
enough broadband to play it, it is just after all another game and SWG is 
getting on now and there needs to be another SW MMO thats gonna take over SWG, 
and SW KotOR Online is definitely the way to go.</p> </li>

<p>Lol, thats true, well, they should make it for the PC anyway, most games 
are made for the PC as the PC is almost considered as a next-gen type console

<h6>Crowlis on 27 Apr '07 said:</h6> 
<p>Well, thats what i don't understand, if they are making KotOR Online, it 
won't take over the KotOR SP games, its separate, it won't have anything to do 
with KotOR 1, 2 or 3 (when it gets made), it will be a separate story with 
hardly any relation to the SP games, so it won't matter if they make it 
because, it won't take over the original KotOR games we all know and love, so 
thats why i don't see why people won't give it a chance, the point is if you 
don't want to play it, then don't, it's a as simple as that, it's just Star 
Wars in the old republic, in my opinion, they should make more games in the 
KotOR era and not just leave it to a SP RPG trilogy (I hope for a trilogy), 
anyway thats my daily rant over, lol.</p> </li>

<p>These rumors are nearly complete rubbish. You KOTOR fans have nothing to 
worry about. While Bioware are creating a new MMORPG (they've opened new 
offices specifically for this project) it will not be based on the Star Wars 
universe, it's going to be a brand new IP.</p>
<p>Also Dragon Age (also mentioned in the rumor) is also a brand new IP. </p>
<p>So stop worrying, all of you, this rumor is a load of b*****ks!!!!</p> </li>

<h6>Crowlis on 28 Apr '07 said:</h6> 
<p>I'd like to see your proof that they aren't making it, normally i don't 
listen to rumors either, but when Bioware have heard the rumor and not deny it, 
thats when i decided that they may be making it, so unless you have proof 
stated by Bioware they are not making a SW KOTOR Online, then i think you 
shouldn't post such a bold statement that you have no idea is true.</p> </li>

<p>hopefully this is true kotor is one of the best games on the xbox if not 
the best and this would be a great games on the XBOX360 and hopefully soon to 
follow on the PC the timeframe is perfect they dont hav a specific guidline it 
gives the devs lots of freedom look what they did with the first kotor classic 
this one will definetly b a great game my only worry is storage and space for 
the devs to work with i jus hope they have a base thats full of content then 
post the things they couldnt include on the game for online play on xbox live 
content so we can get a good feel of the game this is great news lets just hope 
that this news will be announced by bioware</p> </li>

<p>I don't understand why six people say no? I mean, come on. It'll be the 
best MMO ever. Maybe even the best MMORPG off of Star Wars! Why say no?</p>
<p>Because you're all seeming like idiots. I mean, come on. Why say no?! Mass 
Effect: SP game..Being made by a seperate district of Bioware; No resources 
('Cept money) being drained.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: (Another seperate district being made by BioWare. Resources 
taken: Money. )</p>
<p>Kotor 3: (Being made by yet another district. Resource: Money.) </p>
<p>Kotor Online (Being made by BioWare; a seperate district. Resources: 
Money.) You see this tree?</p>
<p>They have more than enough talent and money to work on all those. You know 
why? Mass Effect will bring in more money than they could possibly wish for.</p>
<p>Kotor 3 will contribute to that as well. Didn't you know that each district 
will be developing at the same time, those titles? Bet ya didn't. These games 
will all be out when they're done. So if they get finished with Mass Effect, 
they'll move that district onto another project (Or split up the current team, 
and move so-and so to work on one project, and so and so to work on another 
project. ) It doesn't hinder anything! They have enough money from Kotor, and 
Jade Empire, and NwN and NwN2, and Baldur's Gate to pool in ths type of move. 
If done correct, then only 6 people will probably protest it. Hah. I'd love to 
see you 6 in the game, sitting in the corner, holding up 'SayNo to Kotor 
Online' while millions of others walk you by and ignore you. Yeah. That's how 
big MMO's of a great Genre are. Stargate Worlds and KotorOnline will jus tbe 
the topping of the cake. I am actually looking forward to this news, unlike the 
6 people that hate this news. I can't wait for this news to be true. =D</p>

<p>I think that this new is a desire made real if we think in the more number 
of players. Today, despite of some coments here, the solo RPGS are dead.</p>
<p>KOTOR is a dazzling timeline for the SW Universe, and, with an SW Galaxies 
being almos ancient, this is the time for the Bioware Rumor made real, i think.
</p>
<p>The people who says no to the idea of a MMO on KOTOR prefering the 
conventional RPG, is because they have never played online yet. If they 
discover the new game ways, then, they will love the online and they never will 
play conventional games in the future.</p>
<p>This was my way.</p> </li>

<p>I really like the news of KOTOR III a lot. However, I have few things I do 
not like about it.</p>
<p>1. I do not like the idea of it being on-line. Yes, on-line could be great, 
and yeah I have not played an on-line game. But I do not like the idea for the 
same reason why some else said about it. You like a for a game that might take 
you 4 months or .  Not to mention additional fees to it. I rather pay or for a 
band new Xbox game than that. Not that I think on-line game is bad idea. I 
think you should do both. Just do not make the same with KOTOR II.</p>
<p>2. With the Multiplayer mode thing, it's not a bad, but I would rather have 
a single mode to go with it.</p>
<p>3. And with the MMO problem, I personaly do not know anything about MMO. So 
I do not have have anything wrong with it, but I loved the way KOTOR I &amp; 
KOTOR II was made. So I really would just wish that you</p>
<p>Not that I hate this at all, but I real wished that who ever created KOTOR 
II restore it to the way it was met to be played alittle more than KOTOR III.

<p>Completely agree with SoulChimaera.</p>
<p>When I heard this rumour it practically wrecked my day. No doubt we'll be 
charged a ridiculous recurring fee on a monthly basis. I played Star Wars 
Galaxies for some crazy reason and I met probably 5 decent people - everyone 
else was really rude and disrespectful. Actually, KOTORMMOFoWin proves my 
point. &quot;Stop being cheap&quot;, how rude is that? Some people don't have 
people to spoil them mate, I'm skint I can't afford &pound;8.99 a month, would 
you believe it.</p>
<p>Please, if anyone is developing this as an MMO, please just drop the idea 
and make a normal sequel game. It's a much safer option, MMO's always turn out 
to be disasters. This is coming from someone who has played MMOs, the community 
is generally horrible, the gameplay is almost as bad, and they don't have a 
thing on single player RPGs. KOTORIII could be immense, but an MMO would be 
your biggest mistake ever.</p> </li>

<p>This rumor is utter bunk thanks to the extra crap added onto it. Bioware 
have been adamant that Dragon Age is a PC game. Even if EA were to force their 
hand and make them put it on consoles, it wouldn't be PS3-exclusive. That's 
just not how EA roll.</p>
<p>And more importantly, the whole thing about Baldur's Gate pretty much 
consigns the rumor to the rubbish heap. Bioware are totally done with Baldur's 
Gate. They've said it before again and again. More importantly, the license for 
Baldur's Gate as a franchise is still owned by Interplay - the same Interplay 
that<i>still owe Bioware money for unpaid royalties for Baldur's Gate II</i> - 
and the Forgotten Realms license is with Atari. Bioware's owned by EA. Why 
would you outsource a game to your competitor's studios?</p>
<p>The only part that's likely true is a KotOR MMO, but we've been expecting 
that the Bioware MMO is KotOR for years now.</p> </li>

<p>anyone who is posting that they shouldn't make KOTOR an MMO needs to grow 
up. What right do you have to tell them not to make a game that so many people 
want to see made. you sit at your computer and talk about how this would ruin 
the other two games but tell me how would it ruin them its not like when the 
game comes out those two games will change. personally i think that the single 
player KOTOR should stop at 2. only because i don't want to see it turn into 
one of those games that gets to like KOTOR XVI where the game will be the same 
as the last on with just a new face and new names. anyways the point is its 
there company not yours if they want to make a KOTOR MMORPG then they will they 
don't give a s**t about who doesn't want to see it made because they know that 
they will make millions if they make it so sit there and cry because it is 
deffenitly going to be made.</p> </li>
