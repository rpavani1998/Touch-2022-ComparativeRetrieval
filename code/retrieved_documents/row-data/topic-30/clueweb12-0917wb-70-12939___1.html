<p>The next Xbox console is codenamed 'Project Ten' and will release <i>next 
year</i>, the latest rumour report claims.</p> 
<p>Technology reporter Paul Thurrott makes the claim in the Windows Weekly 
video show, in which he claims Microsoft will be &quot;going the Apple 
route&quot; with its next console.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 &quot;What I'm hearing is [the next Xbox is] going to come out 
for holidays next year, meaning that they would almost have to announce this at 
CES, wouldn't they? That's my rumour... that we'll expect to hear something 
about that.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p>He added: &quot;They're going the Apple route where they want this thing to 
integrate very tightly with Windows 8 and Windows Phone, which is a problem 
with the current Xbox.&quot;</p> 
<p>  Thurrott claimed he's been told the next Xbox will feature &quot;embedded 
Microsoft Silverlight&quot;, which is speculated to run the previously announced
Xbox Live TV platform.</p> 
<p>The claims somewhat match with a rumour from earlier this week, which 
claimed the next Xbox will run a version of Windows and feature a Zune HD-like 
hardware platform.</p> 
<p>Microsoft has long spoken of its ten-year plan for Xbox 360, which launched 
in late 2005, but that doesn't rule out a successor launching during the 
period, according to European Xbox boss Chris Lewis,who said in August:</p> 
<p>&quot;We think we're a little over halfway with the life cycle of the 
console, but that's not to say there won't be an overlap. I'm not going to 
announce specifically or talk about timing. But you could imagine there could 
be overlap, it depends. We're not being specific about the next generation at 
this stage.&quot;</p> 
<p>Saber Interactive CEO, Matthew Karch, who's currently heading up the Halo: 
Combat Evolved Anniversary single-player campaign, told CVG last month he'd be 
&quot;shocked&quot; if Microsoft doesn't launch its next-gen console before 
Sony.</p>

<p>If consoles simply do not have that major jump in game quality and quantity 
that I personally want in AI, physics and animation, I won't even give a 
seconds thought in dismissing them. If they end up just being something of a 
social hub for technology and online gaming, they can bugger off. Gaming as a 
whole seems to get distracted and ends up going a different route that I wanted 
with each generation. I remember the days when single player games were amazing 
and fun adventures that you could go back to many times and when multiplayer 
was having a blast with your mates around the tv. Now it's all separated 
content with rare great games that are rarely replayable and now a bunch of 
deathmatch and capture the flag/zone/hill variations all being played on a box 
that can connect to other things.</p> </li>

<p>I hope they do release the 720 next year, waiting until 2013 would only 
give Sony the chance of releasing first, not to mention giving the Wii U a free 
run for a year.</p> </li>

<p>Out next year? I'm sort of smelling a rushed release here. Provided this is 
true at least. I would have thought 2013 but it is time to move on. Its just 
that given the current situation this sounds a bit weird. Also what about Halo 
4? Isn't that releasing on 360? Makes more sense to make it a launch title imo. 
They could pull a Twilight Princess.</p>
<p>Its going to be interesting next E3.</p> </li>

<p>Erm, why? It's not as if most people bother with the current integration. 
Mind you, the streaming options and ability of PS3 to be a media hub have 
obviously not escaped MS's attention. But that would need more open 
architecture, proper adoption of USB and the ability to playback most video and 
audio codecs, which would seem to be something they're very reluctant to do.</p>

<p>The 360 was, however, rushed to beat PS3 out of the door. Hence all the

Ironically, PS3 was delayed because of politics in the BluRay conglomerate so 
they needn't have panicked.</p> </li>

<p>You'd also be a dope for buying the overpriced monstrosity.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to WiiU. But the Xbox 360 has been such a brilliant 
console that I'm looking forward to seeing what the next one is like. I think 
we can take phenomenal graphics and great online features as a given. They can 
stick with the same controller for me as well, although I doubt they will.</p>
<p>Too much focus on Kinect is the only thing that could ruin it.</p> </li>

Sorry. Should have mentioned. I mean rushed to compete with Nintendo. 
Obviously MS have planned/are talking about a 2013 release or that rumour 
wouldn't keep coming up. In which case it is being rushed.</p> </li>

<p>they will want too much control over it to make it a decent 
windows-integrated multimedia hub... i.e. no point. and everything will be 
microsoft brand: no choice, locked down.</p>
<p>they would need to allow a web browser... the feature no-one wants. or the 
feature they fear may take the sheen off the paid-for content.</p> </li>

<p>Id probably say the PS3 was delayed because they knew Nintendo had 
something big up their sleeve i.e. motion control, and they wanted to steal the 
idea, hence the crappy six axis thing. Classic Sony, look back at their 
thieving history in gaming, i don&#146;t think they have actually brought 
anything to the party? Ps1, originally a Nintendo project (read about it, due 
to CD drive), Ps2, a more powerful Ps1 with the same controller, Ps3, a move 
powerful Ps2 with the same controller...</p> </li>

<p>I can't wait to see what Microsoft come up with for the next generation.</p>
<p>The speculation / rumours around using ARM based CPUs seems pretty exciting 
though having a single core for different game functions (e.g. 4 to 8 cores) 
could end up being pretty weak compared to - say - Sony's speculated 32 core 
PS4 CELL processor. Microsoft's SDK will surely make their platform easier than 
Sony's to develop for again though.</p>
<p>I'm actually more interested in whether Microsoft stick with physical media 
of some kind - whether disc or memory card based, plus whether peripherals are 
open / free to use across platforms and whether Microsoft's GPU will remain AMD 
/ ATI or go ImgTec. If Microsoft wants to clamp, stamp and lock devices and 
software exclusively to its platforms they'll have to do a better job than 
Apple - DAY 1 - to get me to consider forking out for a new steering wheel, or 
doing anything along the lines of converting all my iTunes &amp; iPod music / 
movie s**t over. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Like anyone with any common sense, I'll be waiting to see what the hardcore 
- non Kinect - games are like before picking one up.</p> </li>

<p>It better be able to play HD MKV's or it's a dud as a media device, same 
for Wii U and PS4.</p>
<p>Sure the machine is in the post, so to speak, but Halo 4 is in the way.</p>
<p>It's been worked on on 360 for years and to switch out now would put the 
game back at least a year. I think MS have missed a trick with Halo 4 myself; 
it should be a launch title for the new machine and would help them hit the 
ground running.</p>
<p>Rumours are a new Perfect Dark will hit for 10's launch but I'll wait and 
see on that one.</p>
<p>Also, someone mentioned Twilight Princess; You mean port a previous gen 
game with no upgrades whatsoever to the new format when it was ready to ship 2 
years earlier?</p>
<p>Please no, Nintendo weakened TP's impact by being so cynical. Great Cube 
game, poor Wii title.</p> </li>

Disagree. Twilight Princess is my favourite Zelda. I don't know what 
your talking about. Now I shall sulk. Jk. Yeah I mean release on 360 and the 
new Xbox at the same time.</p>
<p>This still doesn't make sense to me. Why release your big game on 360 in 
Autumn and then release your next console mere months later? Halo 4 would be 
the best game for the system. It would also being a great way of starting the 
new trilogy on the new console. There is too much conflicting with this rumour. 
I call BS tbh. I'd like to see what CVG can dig up.</p> </li>

<p>Fair enough on TP, it's decent, a nice solid 8/10 for me. I'll leave my 
true opinions of TP out of this as i tend to p**s a lot of younger Nintendo 
fans off when i go for the hatchet job. </p>
<p>The best was when someone accused me of being a Sony Fanbitch with no clue 
of Nintendo's accomplishments a few years back. </p>
<p>I'm sure the Sony fans here now are wondering how the f*ck that happened, 
same here. </p> </li>

<p>The integration doesn't surprise me in the slightest. And to be honest, 
neither does the release date. A christmas 2013 release date would givethe Wii 
U 12-18 months unchallenged (depending on when they launch) as the most 
powerful console on the market by some margin, which I really can't see 
happening.</p>
<p>An E3 2012 release followed by a launch window of somewhere between 
Christmas 2012 and Summer 2013 would make more sense.</p> </li>

<p>This is one of two reasons why I'm not buying new Xbox 360 paraphernalia or 
a Xbox 360 Slim (the other reason being that I simply don't actually<i>need</i> 
to). I'd rather wait a year and a half - maybe two - and see what a new console 
offers. I would like to continue with MS's console line but if it doesn't have 
backwards compatibility with my Xbox 360 games library, then I may decide not 
to go with MS. Which leaves Sony (Nintendo is too simplistic for my tastes from 
what I've seen so far)...and I avoid buying Sony products at every chance. That 
might mean a return to PC gaming only for me then. Should be interesting either 
way.</p> </li>

<p>I've never really got the Media hub stuff about the PS3 to be honest. I've 
found that my 360 and PS3 play the same stuff, but maybe that's just the files 
I have. Although I do use Media Centre extender, so maybe that's the 
difference. Setting it up and streaming all the stuff off it is a doddle, 
although you don't want to do it with a wireless connection on either device - 
the input lag on the menus in Media Centre is awful.</p>
<p>It's quite funny all the playing of video files though. I imagine a tiny 
percentage of these are legal.</p>
<p>I do like iplayer and BR playback on my PS3, but ultimately I just want a 
top games console. You can forget about 64GB SDXC though - unless the prices 
come down to a couple of quid as opposed to the &pound;70 odd they cost now! 
Blu Ray or equivalent and a fat HDD (that you can change yourself without 
getting your console banned) should be fine.</p> </li>

<p>Windows 8 must surely be coming out early to mid 2012 to boost Microsoft's

<p>Hmmm, if these 'rumours' are true, then it would perhaps explain the 
release of Halo 4, AC 3 or whatever, (and possibly Fable 4 and Alan Wake 2) etc
</p>
<p>That said 2012 seems abit rushed, i was thinking more 2013. <br>
Having 
just upgraded to the slim version and kinect, i don't plan on getting the next 
box straight away. The current 360 is still great and can still manage and wow 
us with games like Batman AC, and other upcoming games like Halo CEA, Rayman 
Origins, Assassins Creed: Revelations, ME3 etc...</p>
<p>Like Cell Fish put it, i'll wait a couple years to see what its like and if 
any good, i'll get the slim version...if there's one.</p>

<p>HALO 4 would certainly make next Xbox's launch a lot easier. I just hope 
they are not going to make next Xbox a disc free console. it would be disaster 
for many gamers who already own piles of 360 games and those who do not have 
fast internet to download something that's taking lots of HDD space. I also 
hate the idea of cloud gaming (some of the rumors are suggesting this) coming 
to next big thing. 2012 holiday season launch is hardly possible, more likely 
2013 summertime. I also hope that MS will not repeat their RROD problem with 
the new console. I'd rather wait longer and be safe than get it early and 
regret it.</p> </li>

Why would you buy that, particularly if you already own a 360. If you 
own a 360 and you bought that anyway, you have no one to blame for that but 
yourself. And if you didn't own a 360, until this point, then why do you care 
when the next one is coming out. You waited five years to get a 360, why rush 
out and get the next system?</p> </li>

<p>Thurrott hasn't got a prediction right in a fair while, so even though much 
of what he says is logical (they'd be crazy not to integrate all their products 
and services, for one), I'll be taking this rumour with a quarry-ful of salt.

<p>It would be nice for the next xbox to :-</p>
<p>1) Still have games on disc <br>
( I truly hope it isn't going the 
&quot;Apple&quot; route with DRM downloaded software/games etc, I want a 
physicality with my games).</p>
<p>2) Have a true quantum leap in graphics, issue there is that the current 
Xbox produces great visuals.( as does PS3)</p>
<p>3) Have a lot more ram and a much larger HD to allow more games to be 
installed, faster data access and assist with graphics.</p>
<p>4) Have Bluray compatibility out of the box, and not some dodgy add on.</p>
<p>5) Allow you to carry your gamer tag and gamerscore over.</p>
<p>6) Be more reliable upon release than the 360.</p>
<p>7) Not come out for another 2 years, there's still lots of life in the 
existing Xbox 360. Take a look at PS2, some of the consoles best titles came 
out near the unnecessary release of PS3. PS2 still had lots of life in it.</p>
<p>Both companies are terrified the other will get one up on them so they will 
both have their next gen consoles prepared. We, the actual consumers, are 
probably quite happy to stay with the current gen, but MS and Sony won't care, 
and they'll release regardless.</p>
<p>Trouble is, we'll all have to put up with the first year of the new 
consoles having mostly rubbish titles on them.</p> </li>

<p>Just a thought....maybe Halo 4 releases for the 360 in 2012 and the new 
system comes out in 2013 a little more polished with the start of a new Gears 
of War as a launch title. Personally think that would be bigger and as Epic 
said &quot;this is the end of delta squads story&quot;. That doesn't mean its 
the end for Gears of War and with all the improvements on gameplay I can't wait 
to see what's next, especially on a new system with aother generation of the 
Unreal Engine.</p> </li>

<p>I would like to see sony &amp; M$ get together and agree on a release 
window for the next consoles. Launching both consoles within the same month 
would be fantastic in my opinion. Would also help the game developers.</p> </li>

<p>Id probably say the PS3 was delayed because they knew Nintendo had 
something big up their sleeve i.e. motion control, and they wanted to steal the 
idea, hence the crappy six axis thing. Classic Sony, look back at their 
thieving history in gaming, i don&#146;t think they have actually brought 
anything to the party? Ps1, originally a Nintendo project (read about it, due 
to CD drive), Ps2, a more powerful Ps1 with the same controller, Ps3, a move 
powerful Ps2 with the same controller...</p> </blockquote>
<p>You do realize that sony was actually developing the move years before 
nintendo did the wii right?</p> </li>

<blockquote> 
<p>there is still plenty of life in the 360 yet.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Would have to strongly disagree with that, especially after seeing the 
console version of BF3 and MW3. The gap between the capabilities of PC and 
consoles at the moment is huge (a point illustrated perfectly by Battlefield 
3), and its going to get bigger yet again in early 2012 when NVidia release 
their Kepler cards and AMD release their 7000 series cards.</p>
<p>My brother also got Modern Warfare 3 on launch day and shouted me in to 
have a look at it. The first thing I thought was 'why the hell is he playing 
MW2 before realising it was MW3. Its basically the same game repolished from 
two years ago.</p>
<p>Not to mention the 360 (and PS3) are dinosaurs as far as the hardware 
inside them goes, not far off a generation old, and are incapable of playing 
games at true 1080p. Its all well and good saying ' I'm happy with this gen, we 
don't need a new console bla bla' but technology moves on at the end of the day.

<p>Regarding the previous rumor (XBox using ARM processor, smaller, cheaper), 
other sites reporting on this also reported that the next XBox was scheduled 
for a 2015 release. Does anyone else think thats a couple of years too late?</p>
<p>2012 - Bit soon perhaps going off what we know but I wouldn't complain, and 
wouldn't rule it out. Would definitetly expect a reveal of some kind.<br>
2013 
- Still the most likely for release in my opinion, and would make the most 
logical sense, let the XBox 360 go out with a bang with Halo 4, then move on.
<br>2014 - Had nintendo not announced the Wii U this would not have surprised 
me, but if Nintendo releases the Wii U in summer 2012, as far as console power 
is concerned, this would leave Microsoft playing second fiddle to Nintendo for 
the best part of 18-30 months??? Just can't see it<br>
2015 - Similar to above. 
Assuming Sony havent released the PS4 by then, giving nintendo potentially a 
full 3 years as having the most powerful console???? Aint going to happen.</p>

<p>Out next year? I'm sort of smelling a rushed release here. Provided this is 
true at least. I would have thought 2013 but it is time to move on. Its just 
that given the current situation this sounds a bit weird. Also what about Halo 
4? Isn't that releasing on 360? Makes more sense to make it a launch title imo. 
They could pull a Twilight Princess.</p> 
<p>Its going to be interesting next E3.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Rushed release? Really? The Xbox 360 is 6 years old, it'll be 7 when this 
comes out (if true).</p> 
<p>I've also said previously that Halo 4 would be a great title to launch a 
new console with.</p> </blockquote>
