<p>By Tamoor Hussain for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Philippe Cardone, CEO of PlayStation France, has said the a PlayStation 
Vita installment of Capcom's wildly popular Monster Hunter franchise is 
expected in the next few months.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 In an interview with Le Point Cardon made a direct reference to 
the lack of a Monster Hunter title and went on to seemingly confirm when it 
will show up on Sony's new handheld.
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;The games available at launch in Japan do not correspond to the 
typology of the Japanese public. It lacks a particular game, Monster Hunter, 
scheduled for the coming months,&quot; said the Sony man.</p> 
<p>This month Vita sales fell 57 percent week-over-week, dropping below 20,000 
units and placing it fourth in the hardware rankings. Since launch, weekly Vita 
sales have come in at 324,859 units, 72,479, 42,648, 42,915 and now 18,361.</p> 
<p>When quizzed on the decline Cardone said &quot;the games available at 
launch in Japan do not correspond to the typology of the Japanese public,&quot; 
specifically calling out the lack of a Monster Hunter title and providing an 
assurance that the European launch would be better suited to tastes.</p> 
<p>&quot;Had it been there right out in Japan, the story would have been 
different. The game console at launch will be the European better than it was 
for Japan.&quot;</p> 
<p>Cardone has also said Sony isn't under pressure to announce the PS4 and 
'will probably be last to announce something'.</p> computerandvideogames.com

<p>And thus the Vita was saved. Much like a Nintendo system without a Mario or 
Zelda game, there is no point in a Sony handheld without Monster Hunter.</p>

<p><br>
Did you never see the PSP sales?</p>
<p>&quot;covering December 1 through December 5, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd 
sold 2,146,467 units. The game also gave a huge boost to PSP hardware sales. 
Over the week, PSP sold 326,639 hardware units, 4.31 times more than previous 
week&quot;<br>
Sales like that when PSP has been out years.<br>
They should 
have had the boxed version of HM on the shelf, sure it's in the store but they 
need it on show in the shops. I've seen the difference between the PSP one and 
Vita, it looks so much better on Vita.</p> </li>

<p>I wouldn't put my trust in Google translate to be accurate, he could have 
meant that they've missed out on not having Monster Hunter in the coming months 
as he doesn't say, &quot;which will be out in the coming months&quot;</p>
<p>I'm sure Monster Hunter will come, unless Nintendo paid Capcom a king's 
ransom.</p> </li>

<p>He's talking about Monster Hunter Portable 3rd the PSP game which also has 
a PS3 and Vita version and has yet to launch in the west hence why he's talking 
about it being present at launch.</p> </li>

<p>No offence to the CEO of Playstation France but I doubt he'd know anything 
of a new MH title. Wait for Capcom to announce something before getting excited.

<p>So it is going to be Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD? The only thing I've 
heard about that was that highly questionable pamphlet. Ah well, if true then 
the Vita's success is basically guaranteed, at least in the Far East. I always 
said that Capcom would like a slice of both pies, and it looks like I've been 
proven right.</p>
<p>Although I do wonder if we'll ever get an English version.</p> </li>

<p>Wasn't that just the PSP version through backwards compatibility, though? I 
never saw anything about getting a dedicated Vita version, and I've followed 
the Vita since it was announced. This is one thing I'd love to be proved wrong 
on, though.</p> </li>

True, a PSP port. They need to HD this and get it on the shelves. 
Saying that, have you seen the Vita version next to the PSP 3000 version? Blows 
it away.<br>
A bit of a re release with some new areas and extra polish will 
have fans in Japan running to the game shops, and Sony know it. They need to 
give Capcom some cash me thinks. </p> </li>

The's a port of it on Vita not just through BC.</p>
<p><br>
@ KrisaimUK</p>
<p>I don't know about that, the problem with games like MH and DQ is that they 
sell to their userbase with in the first few weeks, 3rd has sold 4.7m already 
in Japan so those who want it already own it they'll need to do something like 
release an extended version for Vita, 3rd G, remember that many still have yet 
to buy Vita due to price.</p> </li>

PS3 and PSP. All the gameplay vids are of it running through BC as well.</p>

Pretty sure it's out but as a download game as it's a direct port, the 
game in the BC version is the same game only you get a discount, the rumors in 
Japan is that 3rdG will surface in Japan in the coming months for retail so 
the's no point putting the PSP port on shelves.</p> </li>
