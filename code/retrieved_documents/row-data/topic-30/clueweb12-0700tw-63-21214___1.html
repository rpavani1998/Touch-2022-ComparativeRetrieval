<p>The new issues of Xbox World and PSM3 are on sale now.</p> 
<p>These are the eye-watering visuals Sony and Microsoft's next gen consoles 
will be capable of. At least, that's what PSM3 and Xbox World magazines are 
saying in their latest issues.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 In collaboration with Codemasters' lead artist Mike Smith and 
Dead End Thrills techmaster Duncan Harris, both magazines present a glimpse of 
the future: what PS4 and Xbox 720 will be capable of in terms of visuals - but 
also what they'll be capable of in terms of scale, lighting, landscapes, AI and 
procedural generation.
<p></p> 
<p>With developers harnessing what the magazines claim will be &quot;six times 
the power&quot;, Codemasters' Smith says: &quot;If you look at the amount of 
effort that goes into lighting at companies like Pixar, we're quite some way 
away from being able to leverage that control. (But) once we have a toolset to 
do that, art directors can go crazy.&quot;</p> 
<p>What's interesting, particularly for PlayStation owners, is that the 
screenshots running in PSM3 are from tech that echoes the reported specs of 
PS4, with recent rumours suggesting Sony are ditching PS3's controversial Cell 
chip, and working with AMD to providePS4's graphics chips. (In effect, PS4 will 
be &quot;essentially a PC&quot; according to sources close to tech specialist 
Richard Leadbetter, of Digital Foundry.)</p> 
<p>Could this stunningly rendered ladybird be the norm in a few years time?</p>
<p></p> <br>
 The goodness doesn't stop there in the latest issues either: 
PSM3 has an eight-page Medal of Honor exclusive, Xbox World delivers six pages 
of impressions from The Witcher 2, while both have reviews of Mass Effect 3, an 
exclusive interview with DMC development chief Tameem Antoniades (sample quote: 
&quot;I've nothing against big tits - I'd rather have my head resting on a pair 
right now&quot;) and a feature on the future of retail that's essential reading.
<p></p>

<p>Please for the love of god, can I just have some innovation, better design, 
immersion etc. Keep your sodding ultra uber realistic gfx that then require you 
devs to &quot;highlight&quot; interactive objects as soooooo many noobs can't 
tell the difference (yes I'm talking about the &quot;blue interactive&quot; 
crap you see on Uncharted and even my beloved ninja gaiden 2!</p>
<p>Publishers need to grow some and take a chance on a new IP too!</p>
<p>It's becomming stagnant, though this is due to the mass market flocking 
towards many of the titles (heck im guilty of that).</p>
<p>But, where are my steel battalions of this gen? </p>
<p>And no the kinect one fails as I dont get to pretend to be a mech, making 
guns from my arms in hillarious ways </p> </li>

<p>Isn't the same thing said every generation? PCs are ten times more powerful 
than current consoles and already eclipse this standard. Also, I think it's 
more likely that Valve are making a custom, &quot;valve&quot; badged PC with 
their own interface, rather than a console.</p> </li>

<h6>sample3 on 7 Mar '12 said:</h6> 
<p>What are you all on about? The first screenshot is definetely from Crysis. 
The other one is just some tech demo of a console that doesnt even have any 
official specs. So this is all wild speculation. Dont start with your &quot;My 
10 year old PC can already do this&quot; Hell, Uncharted 3 looks better than 
the first picture.</p>
<p>Edit: The Samaritan demo from Unreal Engine 4 is probably where the next 
gen consoles will be. Oh and stop basing consoles by their specs. A PC with the 
specs of a PS3 would not be able to run Uncharted 3. When developing for PC's 
they have to take into account all different hardware combinations. When 
developing for consoles. All the millions of users has exactly the same spec.
<br> It comes down to optimization.</p> </li>

<h6>Unition on 7 Mar '12 said:</h6> 
<p>Like the majority of other posts, gamers today are not looking for better 
and better graphics. We want games that are more intelligent and more 
interactive. It's that simple. We want to experiment with worlds that use 
complex physics, and by doing so, be able to approach gameplay in any style of 
our choosing. Give up on using XP to unlock in-game features. If we pay 
&pound;40 for a game, I want to be able to use everything immediately. Our 
progress through a game should be driven via a strong narrative, just like 
Halo:CE, and exploration should feel instinctive, inspired by a rich and 
imaginative world. Get rid of NPCs and populate game worlds with 
human-controlled characters. Yes, we want to play as the protagonist, but why 
not the antagonist, and every other in-game character as well? Expand the 
concept of what a game should be and let us customize the way in which we want 
to play.</p> </li>

Oh ya that was my initial point. People are saying they are content 
waiting until there's innovative ideas being cooked up but if that's the 
mentality then they will be waiting forever. Other than indie devs and sims on 
PC I can count the amount fresh ideas this gen on one hand. Some of us may be 
bored of the same things but you just have to look at sales to see that 99% of 
gamers don't give a f**k and publishers are aware of this.</p>
<p>Personally I really do need better visuals as I primarily play on PC and 
coming back is kind of painful most of the time. Of course I'm probably in the 
minority on this one but some technical advancement never hurt anybody.</p>

<p>People say that PC graphics are the best but then they say 
gameplay&gt;graphics.Which is it? Cause you seem to set double standards. You 
want a good looking game but then go graphics&gt;gameplay. Oh and end up 
playing minecraft(which btw is a fugly ass looking game). If people call 
minecraft &quot;PC&quot; gaming than high end PC gaming has no future sorry.</p>

<p>Ugh, same old story. Graphics look amazing in tech demos and stills but 
look nothing like that in actual games. Also, manufacturers have to remember 
that throughout the history of computer games, the most powerful console was 
never the biggest seller, as sales figures will show. So, I hope they don't get 
so caught up in making a mighty console that they forget all about needing to 
sell the thing.</p>
<p>On a personal note, the more realistic the game, the less interested I am 
in playing it. I want to play computer games, not play what looks like a 
simulation. That is just my personal taste of course, but I will always take 
the visuals of, say, Breath of Fire 4 over Mass Effect 3 any day.</p> </li>

actually flourishing and at current projections of growth in the PC market and 
the console markets (this does not take in to account release of a new 
generation of consoles) PC gaming is well on the way to once more dominate the 
gaming scene financially. You're kidding yourself if you think PC gaming is 
dead. If there is any doubt that there is room for both PC and console gaming 
all one needs to do is take a look at the state of the current gaming world.</p>
<p>Personally I would be thrilled to be see greatly improve graphics (ex. AA, 
lighting effects, physics, improved AI too for that matter, and more besides), 
yet I concur with various other posters that graphics alone do not make a 
compelling and engrossing gaming experience. I would like healthy servings of 
both improved graphics and innovation (personally well crafted story telling 
that sees me invested in the characters is one of the single largest factors 
that draw me to, and keep me loyal to, a game series). Oh, and backwards 
compatibility will have a huge influence on whether I get on board with the 
next generation of consoles or not.</p> </li>

<p>If the always superior PC's can't offer any true innovations with all that

innovative either.</p> </blockquote>
<p>lmao , was thinking exactly same thing, im not sure which i detest more the 
snotty nosed pc gimps, or the console boys, who are constantly clamouring for 
new consoles , as if thats suddenly going to give us games that arent simply 
prettier versions of what we have now. expect cod clones galore, more cars 
going around in circles and the usual things we've had for past 15 or more 
years. The last real revolution in gaming was the advent of 3 dimensional 
worlds , beyond that, I cant honestly think of anything that's really different 
to what preceded it.</p>
<p>better graphics, higher frame rates etc, all no doubt need improving 
eventually, I just honestly cant say, that I am particularly in a hurry to 
upgrade to get these things. I have enjoyed this gen plenty, and as I've got 
older, Ive less time to play games, and I just cant see myself tearing out the 
traps to buy the next gen day one, like I have previously. Instead I think i'll 
just pick up the games Ive not played this gen for peanuts and wait for the 
next gen to really get into its stride. No matter how pretty the graphics get, 
Ive always noticed myself finding things that could be better, and that will 
never end, that's just human nature, we're never satisfied by what we've got, 
but this time, I'm not getting dragged into it, as I'll pay through the nose, 
not really have anything I didnt have before, other than more fps, and slicker 
visuals, so I may as well wait until price drops and they really start pushing 
the tech.</p> </li> </ol>
