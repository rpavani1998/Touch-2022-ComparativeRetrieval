powerful graphics and a good selection of games. Today you're going to learn 
the basics ofxbox 360 repair and copy xbox 360 games. XBox is still prone to 
one problem - the red ring of death, This is caused by various hardware errors 
such as a loose graphics processing unit, or the more common issue of 
overheating due to too much heat in too small of an area inside the case.<br>
