<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Sony could strip down its existing free PlayStation Network service to 
offer multiplayer gaming alone at no cost.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 And while analysts don't expect Sony to adopt a 
subscription-only approach to PSN, they do think the firm's planning to boost 
its efforts to attract consumers to a paid version of the online service.
<p></p> 
<p>Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told GamesIndustry.biz: &quot;I 
think it's unlikely that they will require a fee, but think they will strip 
down the free version to multiplayer and not much else in order to encourage 
people to pay the fee.&quot;</p> 
<p>Billy Pidgeon of M2 Research agreed. &quot;Providing networked services for 
online gaming is not inexpensive, and charging for these services would help 
Sony defray those costs. I think Sony would best benefit by continuing to build 
out on the currently employed freemium model, charging for enhanced, tiered and 
incremental items, services and add-ons to add value to the online gaming 
experience.&quot;</p> 
<p>He added: &quot;The PlayStation Plus program provides great incentives for 
subscribers, and Sony can get more revenue from advertising, item transactions 
and specialized services to enhance specific aspects of online gameplay such as 
custom content and rules for use for individuals, guilds and other groups. Sony 
should also move quickly to shift paid content other than gaming to the 
network.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sony has forecast a massive $6.4 billion loss for the financial year just 
ended and, in a bid to reverse its fortunes,it plans to make its digital 
imaging, game and mobile offerings &quot;the three main focus areas of its 
electronics business&quot;. New CEO Kaz Hirai's strategy outline indicates 
&quot;the company also aims to increase sales by enriching its catalogue of 
downloadable game titles and subscription services available through the PSN 
platform.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sony said last month that there are over 90 million PSN accounts worldwide.
</p> 
<p>It also confirmed this morning that PSN will be going offline for 
&quot;scheduled maintenance&quot; today - and that you won't be able to access 
PS3 online play for at least 13 hours.</p> 
<p>Microsoft will also implement a new strategy to 'further monetize' Xbox 
Live subscribers this year,according to the LinkedIn profile of a group product 
planner at the company.</p> <br>

<p>So the differnce would be that people would not have access to demos unless 
they paid? I doubt that would encourage many to pay for a better service.<br>

Im already a ps plus subscriber. They should just enhance psplus, make it 
sexier.</p> </li>

<p>Anyway, they have repeatedly stressed they won't charge for online play,

content.</p>

<p>They could...but they won't and what could they strip down already for free 
online MP? If they want people to join up to the subscription service, then it 
needs to appeal to more people, not to mention needs more exposure as well, not 
to mention maybe also look at direct redeemable vouchers you can buy in store 
like a membership renewal for many other online services.</p> </li>

<p>As long as online play is still free I'm not really bothered, I doubt 
anything will change anyway, if analysts were to be believed we'd all have been 
paying to play online since two minutes after the PSN launched. </p> </li>

<p>Mr Patcher seems to get paid to create sound bites to fuel forum hits which

<p>2 comments really,</p>
<p>First, just because you pay for a service doesn't automatically make it 
better, the price needs to be justified. Not saying Live is s**t but does 
paying for sex make it any better? No because you'll probably catch something.
</p>
<p>Second, in response to the article, Sony should be doing the opposite. 
Rather than take things away from the free service, they should improve/make 
PS+ really worthwhile. Or are they completely out of ideas?</p> </li>

<p>It's true, there's little value in just removing free demos. Sony have 
repeatedly stressed how they see psplus more in terms of adding content that 
will offer value, rather than charging for what they consider to be basic 
content ie demos and mp. Plus japanese public arent really into MP online in 
same way west is, wouldnt really work there to charge for mp content</p>

But that isnt due to psn , is it? The same still applies to live, 
except youre paying for live and an online pass. </p> </li>

</blockquote>
<p>This sound a far better idea for making more money from the PSN service. 
More downloadable games from the Playstation back catalogue along with new 
release and an increase in the number of subscription services on offer seems 
like it would move PSN and the Playstation console forward rather than just 
copying MS and making a system wide online pass like LIVE.</p>
<p>I still think one of the best things LIVE or PSN could offer as part of 
their subscription package is the ability to run your own server with your own 
settings for any game.</p>
<p>What confuses me is around the internet people are always calling for Sony 
to charge for the PSN online play, there are regularly articles about it and 
forum comments along the same lines, but these calls from people wanting to pay 
more money seem to strongly out weight the comments that LIVE online play 
should become free. Why in the gaming world are people always moaning gaming is 
too expensive, games are priced too high, consoles cost too much, but these 
same people are happy to pay for LIVE and even want the same sort of fee 
introduced on PSN as well </p> </li>

<p>Sony made the PSN free this gen as an incentive to buy the machine over the 
Xbox, they gave up on the chance of bringing in millions to try and gain more 
market share. They have tried to recoup some of this through the PS+ scheme. 
There's no way that they will change that this gen as it goes against what they 
have set in place with free online gaming.</p>
<p>Next gen i think will be a different matter and both systems will be 
charging for their online services. Sony will want a slice of that pie this 
time. With ice-cream on the side!</p> </li>

<p>There is a justification in that servers cost money to stay online. However

<p>In general its just a much more robust and stable service. </p>
<p>However in recent years i would say that Sony have definately upped there 
game as far as PSN is concerned. the pricing of retail games on PSN for example 
is much beter than the 360.</p>
<p>Whether you prefer whats on PSN over live and vice versa is generally just 
a matter of taste really. I think both have some really good offerings and like

<p>utter b*****ks, ive had 360 and ps3, and really isnt any better on live 
than psn. Fifa 12 was equally s**t online on ps3 and 360, crysis 2 lagged as 
much on ps3 as much as 360, cod blops was a lag fest on 360 as much as ps3 etc 
etc. demos were downloaded as quick etc etc</p>
<p>the only major improvement of live is x game chat, and that's a restriction 
of ps3's os eating up too much ram. The only other thing i preferred was not to 
do with live at all, but simply way updates on hardware and software are 
installed on 360.</p>
<p>You get the downtime of psn for maintenance as well as down side, but not 
issue if you just log in in morning.</p>
<p>The myth of live being much better and proof of you get what you pay for, 
is just that, a myth. MS's os is more efficient and better designed, and that's 
where any improvements of live over psn are found. The idea of servers being 
somehow better etc is utter BS. I had no regrets not renewing live membership 
and selling 360 recently.</p> </li>

<p>You know, i just read your comment and let out a sigh, no harm to you, but 
im sick to the teeth of all this s**te about Sony loosing customers if they 
start charging for PS network, im sorry, but i believe your totally wrong.</p>
<p>In case it has escaped everyone who plays online games, streams movies and 
other things from PS Network, it costs a LOT of money to keep that running, and 
you can tell the PS network is not a paid for service as it shows in comparison 
to Xbox live, say what you will about MS, but live is leagues ahead of the PS 
network, i should know i have both and wish Sony would give PS network a 
serious face lift. I know people out there wont agree with me, even if they 
know i have a point and thats fine.</p>
<p>Sony are having huge financial problems and need to stop firing money (they 
are not earning from PSN) at the PS network to keep it running. Now if this 
means they start charging a subscription for the services thats fine, as long 
as they improve the service and the content available, no one looses out. Just 
to point out, no one can say MS has suffered from charging for Live, and to be 
honest its such a small fee for a year, how could anyone complain? I spend 
easily twice as much on a single night out.</p> </li>

<p><br>
Every game you talked about there i have for the 360 and i can assure 
it has very very rarely been a lagfest. And i disagree with you about with the 
speed of downloads, i have both the PS3 and 360 and i can assure you, its much 
much quicker to download from live, especially when it comes to a system 
update, Ps3 system updates are a complete joke, take forever. And i know its 
nothing to do with my connection, i have 100mb broadband.</p>
<p>One thing i do agree with is, it is a matter of taste in the end, non of 
the things i mentioned about the Ps3 would be a deal breaker if i had to choose 
between the 2.</p> </li>

<p>i only purchased ps+ for the free games for the kids nowt else </p>
<p>i pay for live for the kids to watch sky as it is cheaper than paying sky 
for the additional box in the house</p>
<p>altho now i pay for ps+ and live for no reason as the kids wanted pc's 
instead </p>
<p>although did get shift 2 for the ps3 today for free as well as shank 2 
(havnt had that sort of thing from ms tho)</p>
<p>i wont be renewing either of them next year tho</p>
<p>the only thing i find with psn over live is the speed i have just upgraded 
to infinity and my pc hits 38mbs the ps3 is wired and only gets 16mbs and the 
xbox seems alot quicker at downloading games than the ps3 so wont make a 
difference when i get uped to 80mps latter this year with only the pc using it

<p>Sony made the PSN free this gen as an incentive to buy the machine over the

There's no way that they will change that this gen as it goes against what they 
have set in place with free online gaming.</p>

<p>I would be willing to bet a testicle that Sony will start charging next gen 
at the very least, Sony already realise they dropped the ball this gen by not

<p>Every game you talked about there i have for the 360 and i can assure it 
has very very rarely been a lagfest. And i disagree with you about with the 
speed of downloads, i have both the PS3 and 360 and i can assure you, its much 
much quicker to download from live, especially when it comes to a system 
update, Ps3 system updates are a complete joke, take forever. And i know its 
nothing to do with my connection, i have 100mb broadband.</p> 
<p>One thing i do agree with is, it is a matter of taste in the end, non of 
the things i mentioned about the Ps3 would be a deal breaker if i had to choose 
between the 2.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I agree ps3 updates are laughable, but that's again not to do with psn or 
live, but to do with OS. Ps3 has to rewrite entire code(relative to certain 
aspects of game or os) for games or OS in updates, whereas 360 updates are 
incremental and simply add new data.</p>
<p>All 3 of those games I mentioned were lag fests and you may have got lucky, 
fifa 12 consistently drops out and has server errors(this is more likely EA 
servers than live, and is equally bad on ps3, because EA has own servers), 
Crysis 2 is notorious as a lag fest and hence game community died within weeks, 
and again is not related to live, as it's ea game, with own servers and it's 
netcode that's issue, whilst COD blops worked fine for me on 360 until an 
update around new years and then lagged like bitch. It was also notorious for 
lag and netcode being rubbish until about 6 months after release. It's host 
balancing code was horrendous, and anyone who was host was penalised horribly. 
You can feel free to look at any of the forums for those games and find 
numerous threads about the issues.</p>
<p>Regardless of your download speed, there's more issues involved in using 
net. I only have 10mb virgin optical service but have low ping speed and my 
connection is always or nearly always good enough to be host in most 
situations. and have never had issues downloading games on psn. 30-40 mins 
average for a 1.8-1.9 gb demo. That's plenty respectable. Streaming videos on 
netflix was instant and no need to buffer etc etc.</p> </li>

well you could always buy a 360 and get free online gaming.........oh 
wait, no you cant.</p>
<p>They havent lost money , they just havent maximised earning from it in same 
way MS have, and like it or not, they have to adapt. what you getting knickers 
in twist about, this hasnt even happened yet, and if they stick to previous 
stance of simply adding content to psplus instead to try entice people, they 
may not strip down psn at all, but if they do, they would simply be getting 
further inline with MS as their competitor, so what would your loss be? Your 
alternatives wouldnt be any better. This article simply speculates that they 
might charge for other features beyond mp online, it doesnt even speculate 
about movie services, which by dint of their nature, it's unlikely they would 
charge to utilise these anyway. PC is only free online gaming system in fullest 
sense in the scenario where they charge for online mo, but again its currently 
being proposed that mp will be charged for, or movie services, let alone 
officially confirmed.</p> </li>

<p>to all in the petty arguement about live being better because you pay for 
it. no it isn't.<br>
I've had MW3 and BF3 on both machines and both run exactly 
same, same lag and same chavvy idiots on CoD on both systems. most my mates 
have both machines and no one notices any difference between the two services. 
In all honesty i just think when folk say they see a better service on 360 
they're just trying to convince themselves that what they paying for isn't 
simply MS ripping them off to line the shareholders pockets, well unfortunatly, 
it is, and you are. convice yourself all you want but lag is simply down to 
your connection speed and time of day you play.</p>
<p>As for what sony are wanting to charge for, they need to be really careful. 
sure online play free would be great but limiting too much what you can do from 
the PSN Store will p*** folk off. PSN+ is pretty poor, i had it for around 
18months and content was average at best. if your feeling flush then its a good 
thing to have just for the free mothly game, its better than nothing and the 
recent shift 2 was a great deal as its a good racing game. I dont usually 
bother with many demos but i fail to see the logic is charging for demos. a 
demo is supposed to be there to encourage you to buy the game so charging for 
it defeats the object. maybe have more of the 1hour game trials that are 
featured on PSN+ but then that requires more online games to purchase, charging 
for demos is just idiotic and i cant see why a games publisher would actually 
support it &pound; for &pound; depending on price it'd be like a car dealer 
charging you &pound;2k to go on a test drive before buying the car that you 
wouldn't get back or have taken off price the car</p> </li>

<p>If you read my comment, or just understood the differences , you would know 
that the update differences are different on both machines, because of the way 
the OS works, on 360 the updates for games and for the OS are tiny as they are 
incremental, whereas they arent on ps3. This is nothing to do with psn or live, 
it's simply a relatively unrefined os in comparison to 360. this is also why 
they have to be installed afterwards. This is also why ps3 cant do x game chat, 
as the operating system is bloated and uses too much ram to leave enough free 
for chat.</p>
<p>MS's business is OS's , and they produced a much more refined one this 
generation for their console. There's no arguing that at all. I also think the 
system design is in larger scale of things better on 360, as it is easy for 
devs to utilise and thus cheap and quick to develop for, but I'm sorry, if you 
are telling me that live is better in anyway, then youre wrong. The content of 
live may be better(this is subjective, I dont like most the 360 exclusives on 
main system, but others may prefer these games to the exclusives on ps3, same 
with live and psn) , but again, that's not the service itself you're paying 
for, that's content. The x game chat and updates are not psn issues, but issues 
with the OS, and cant be resolved by any changes to service.</p>
<p>If you siad, you think 360 and it's online services together are better, 
then i'd say fine, because together as a package it's much more refined, but 
the idea that you think you're paying for chat, updates to be quicker etc is 
just plain wrong. You're paying, because MS wants you to, simple.</p>
<p>I can download demo's that are 2 gb in size on a 10mb connection with low 
ping in under 40 mins. When I had my 360 they took equally as long, so I dont 
buy the live is a better service BS. 360 has more refined operating system 
?Absolutely. 360 offers better content online? Subjective, but if you think 
that, then it's clearly right for you.</p> </li>

<p>If PSN was as good as Live I'd have kept me PS3. Sadly it isn't not only 
for stuff like updates, beacons and chat but also because it's app catalogue is 
not as good, it's laborious to use, Home is a mess and it doesn't have as many 
good arcade exclusives IMO as Live.</p>
<p>Taste comes into this a lot but if people use the negligable price as a

<p>I am of the opinion that forced payment to access online features is 
corporate greed personified. Why should you have to pay MORE on top of the

it appears the online pass is 'supposed' to be doing that. Oh well. LIVE *is* 
better than the PSN...for the price of a game.</p>
<p>But then I subscribe to PSN+ and reckon it is worth every penny. I barely 
play the 'free' games they provide as not all float my boat, but with the 
discounts, early access to Betas and the automated system update

<p>If PSN was as good as Live I'd have kept me PS3. Sadly it isn't not only 
for stuff like updates, beacons and chat but also because it's app catalogue is 
not as good, it's laborious to use, Home is a mess and it doesn't have as many 
good arcade exclusives IMO as Live.</p> 
<p>Taste comes into this a lot but if people use the negligable price as a 
deciding factor then more fool you, it's like opting for a 3 mobile as opposed 
to a Vodafone, I've used both extensively and Live is simply better.</p>

<p>Sony are 10 years behind Xbox Live &amp; MS in terms of infrastructure, 
best thing for them to do in the current climate with all the losses they have 
incurred recently is to get a partner like Valve and run Steam on the next 
system, they have the network expertise to make it a success.</p> </blockquote>
<p> How are they 10years behind?? Are you talking about features? The actual 
PSN used for online gaming is no different than using XBL. Features of the OS 
however are much better on Xbox.</p> </li> </ol>
