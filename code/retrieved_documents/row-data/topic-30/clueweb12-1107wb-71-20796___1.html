BLUNTS replied to Mike Yabz's 
discussion 'Problem with intensafire'  &quot;well, yea um who ever said to use 
nail polish remover before soldering it &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;look at that statement 
its messed up lol, why would you use nail polish remover to clean a circuit 
board in the first place, use&nbsp; 90% alcohol not nail&hellip;&quot;<br>

BLUNTS replied to Mike Yabz's 
discussion 'Problem with intensafire'  &quot;ha is it the same board you glued? 
if so no duh it isnt going to work you already skrewed it up, n unless you want 
to pay for an over expensive controller then intesafire is the best on the 
market, just unintelligent people skrew things up n blame&hellip;&quot;<br>

BLUNTS replied to Richard Shen's discussion 'Xbox 360 intensafire 
sync problem'  &quot;yea use solder, straight up u screw up the glue process 
once n it messes the intensafire up, specially when u turn it on n its 
not&nbsp;completely&nbsp;dry, itll basically short it out.&quot;<br>

full of problems&quot;<br>

BLUNTS replied to Mike Yabz's 
discussion 'Problem with intensafire'  &quot;well theres your problem, when you 
use glue on a cg or matrix controller, it comes with the problem of coming off 
either when you shake your controller when your mad or if you through it (force 
yourself not to) and the glue comes off,&nbsp;so&hellip;&quot;<br>
