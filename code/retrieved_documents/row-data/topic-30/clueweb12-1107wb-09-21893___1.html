<li>View Blog</li> </ul>  I have purchased and installed about 15 of these 
kits in 360 and PS3 controllers, I have soldered them all, no conductive glue 
for me ;) They all work perfectly exactly as described and my customers love 
them. Great product just ignore the noobs who say they don't work, if you know 
how to solder even a little this mod is easy to install and comes with complete 
instructions and the tools required to disassemble the controller. I'd 
recommend this for a 10 year old kid to install its so easy.<br>
<br>
@ the guy 
who bought three kits and all failed: dude seriously you think 3 kits are 
defective? check your work, check to make sure you're following the right 
instructions maybe you think its a CG controller but its actually a Matrix, 
after 3 failed installs maybe you should wonder if its not the product but 
human error? It doesnt get any easier than this, if you can't get it to work 
why not just buy a pre-done controller from ebay or something, youve already 
spent that much...<br>

<dd>  Great to hear! I've probably done over 120 controllers now, all 
soldering, and only ended up with 1 defective intensaFIRE. So to the guy, maybe 
this posters attitude seems a little rude, but I would recommend buying the 
pre-soldered controllers first if you have any doubts about doing this 
modification yourself. </dd> </dl>
