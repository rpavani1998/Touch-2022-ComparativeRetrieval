<br>  ------------------------- XBOX 360 DASHBOARD GUIDE 
------------------------- A quick guide and overview of the Xbox 360 Dashboard. 
The Xbox 360 dashboard is like the operating system on your PC &#150; it allows 
you to modify your console settings and use specific features of the console as 
well as letting you play your favourite 360 and Xbox games. Most 360 owners 
will probably be aware of most if not all of these features but hopefully some 
of you will find parts of it useful. There are four blades which make up the 
360's dashboard &#150; these are Xbox Live, Games, Media and System. I'll take 
each in turn and explain a little about what they contain. ----------------- 
Xbox Live Blade ----------------- The Xbox Live blade contains options relating 
to your Xbox live account. This section contains your Gamercard, Messages, 
Friends list and the Xbox Live Marketplace. GAMERCARD Your gamercard shows your 
reputation and the number of gamerpoints that you have collected from the games 
you have played. Gamerpoints are awarded in most 360 games and Live arcade 
games for obtaining certain achievements during the game. Clicking on any of 
the games you have played here will display the achievements you have been 
awarded and those that you still need to get. Your reputation rating is based 
on what other gamers think of you, the more people enjoyed playing with you 
then the better your reputation. They can also leave negative reputation if you 
abandon a game early or use foul language or unsporting behaviour during games. 
MESSAGES The message area lets you view the messages that have been sent to you 
from your friends. These may be text, voice or picture messages. Messages will 
last for 30 days before the system automatically deletes them. FRIENDS LIST 
Shows a list of all your friends, starting with those that are currently online 
and also shows their gamerscore, gamer picture and their status online (ranging 
from playing a specific game, watching a movie, listening to music or if they 
are away from their console). There are a range of options available to you 
when you select a friend. You can join the game they are in if it is an open 
room, invite them to your game, send them a message, view the games they have 
played XBOX LIVE MARKETPLACE Xbox live marketplace allows you to download 
additional content to your Xbox 360 such as game demos, game and media video 
clips, gamercard pictures and additional themes for the Xbox dashboard. Content 
is added regularly and most demos offer at least one level to be played through 
fully. Much of the content is free but for full Xbox live arcade games, game 
content downloads, most themes and pictures you will need to exchange 
Marketplace points for them. You can also subscribe to the Xbox Live gold 
service in this section using either a pre-paid card or your credit card. The 
Gold service allows you to play multiplayer games against other gamers across 
the globe. You can also redeem your marketplace points here. Subscriptions to 
the gold service are usually sold in 1 month, 3 months or 12 months 
subscriptions. Some games allow the download of additional contents from 
marketplace such as additional weapons, vehicles, maps, characters. Content is 
added to the Marketplace almost on a daily basis so it is worth checking every 
few days for any new demos or content for your favourite games. MARKETPLACE 
POINTS Marketplace points allow you to buy some of the additional content from 
xbox live marketplace. You can order points via Xbox live marketplace using a 
credit card or purchase a pre-paid card from most game retailers and enter the 
code on the card to redeem your points. ------------ Games Blade ------------ 
The games blade contains information relating to the games you have played and 
can play via your Xbox 360. It also includes some of the downloaded content 
that you have obtained from Xbox live marketplace such as Live arcade games, 
demos and trailers. ACHIEVEMENTS This section lists all of the achievements you 
have obtained for all of the games you have played and the total that you could 
have obtained if you managed to get the full amount from each game. PLAYED 
GAMES This just lists all of the games that you have played on your Xbox 360. 
It displays the game, the number of saves, downloads and achievements relating 
to the game and the gamerscore you have obtained from the game. ARCADE This 
section contains any of the Live arcade games you have downloaded via Xbox live 
marketplace &#150; both free demos and full games are included here. There is a 
wide range of retro arcade classics that can be downloaded such as Frogger, 
Pac-man, Paperboy, Gauntlet and defender. There is usually a new arcade title 
release every week. Most games support high definition, contain in game 
achievements and some also contain some form of multiplayer. DEMOS AND MORE The 
demos section contains all of the demos you have downloaded from Xbox live. 
These demos allow you to play at least a single offline mission or some form of 
online play to experience what the final version of the game may be like. You 
can also play XNA games here. ------------ Media Blade ------------ The media 
blade allows you to access your music, photographs and video files either from 
a CD, your home PC or external devices. If you have a PC running windows XP 
Media Edition you can also extend some of these features in this section. MUSIC 
The Xbox 360 will play any of your audio CD's and also mp3's streamed from your 
PC or an external device such as an mp3 player or external hard drive. You can 
also rip music from a CD and store it on your 360's hard drive. Using the music 
player you can also create your own music playlists. You may also listen to 
your own music during a game on the 360, just press the guide button on the 
centre of your control pad and access the music player to select the music you 
wish to play. PICTURES This section allows you to view pictures from your home 
PC or an external device such as a digital camera or external hard drive. This 
allows you to view the pictures in a slide show on your television. VIDEO This 
section allows you to view and movie files you have on your 360 hard drive. You 
can also access .wmv files from your PC using either media connect or playing 
them in windows media player 11. The Xbox 360 will also play DVD movies and 
with the additional HD-DVD add on it will play HD-DVD movies. If you download 
any videos from Xbox marketplace then they will be accessible from here. VIDEO 
MARKETPLACE This links directly to the Video Marketplace, part of the Xbox 
marketplace. Here you can download a whole range of video files and tv shows to 
your Xbox 360. MEDIA CENTRE This allows you to stream content directly from a 
PC running windows media player. Extended abilities are possible if you are 
running windows XP media edition. Features include playing music, additional 
movie files, viewing photographs, pausing live tv and getting movies on demand. 
Additional information on connecting your PC and Xbox 360 can be found at 
http://www.xbox.com/pcsetup ------------- System Blade ------------- The system 
blade is like the control panel of your PC, it allows you to modify much of the 
settings relating to your Xbox 360 such as the Console settings, family 
settings, Memory, network settings, computers, Xbox Live Vision and initial 
Setup CONSOLE SETTINGS Within the console settings there are a number of 
options that you can modify, these are: DISPLAY &#150; Modify HDTV settings and 
screen settings AUDIO &#150; Modify your audio options such as using 5.1 
surround or switching the sound effects on/off THEMES - Allows you to modify 
the dashboard appearance and colour schemes LANGUAGE &#150; Change the language 
used by the Xbox 360 CLOCK &#150; Allows you to modify the time and date and 
the format used. LOCALE &#150; Sets which region the Xbox 360 is being used in 
START UP &#150; Allows you to have your console either play the disk inserted 
on startup or always go to the dashboard first. AUTO 0FF - Turns off console 
after 6 hours of inactivity SCREENSAVER &#150; Enables screensaver to dim 
screen after 10 minutes of inactivity REMOTE CONTROL &#150; Set which remote to 
use on your 360 SYSTEM INFO &#150; Contains the xbox 360's serial number and ID 
FAMILY SETTINGS This section allows you to limit what a child can do on the 
Xbox 360 &#150; this includes limiting Xbox live activity and preventing them 
from playing games and movies that have a particular rating MEMORY This section 
allows you to view the memory devices associated with your 360 and the contents 
of these devices. From here you can copy, delete and move content from the 
memory devices. NETWORK SETTINGS The network settings allows you to set up 
connections with your home network or PC to allow you to connect to Xbox live 
and to share content between your home PC. You can test these connections at 
any time and also edit them or restore them to the default settings. COMPUTERS 
This allows you to manage the connections between your 360 and your home PC. 
XBOX LIVE VISION The Xbox Live Vision option allows you to change the settings 
associated with your Xbox Live Vision camera such as the lighting conditions to 
give you a clearer image when using the camera. INITIAL SETUP This option 
allows you to run the initial setup that happens when you use your 360 for the 
fist time. Running this again may change some of your current settings though 
so be careful. ------------- Little Extras ------------- EXTERNAL DEVICES It is 
possible to connect a few external devices to your 360 via the USB slots. 
Common devices such as Wireless adapters, digital cameras, hard drives and mp3 
players can be connected to your 360. With an mp3 player you can connect it and 
play the music through your 360. I use an external hard drive for all my mp3's 
and photographs so that I can access them and play them through the 360 &#150; 
this makes showing high resolution pictures to friends and family much easier 
than being huddled around a PC monitor. One thing that proves useful is that 
you can view pictures from a digital camera and at the same time play music 
from your ipod. You can also plug in a USB keyboard but this may only be used 
for text input &#150; you are unable to play any games with it. GUIDE BUTTON 
The guide button is the big button on the centre of your control pad with the X 
symbol. This allows for some nice in game features. Using the guide button you 
can switch the console on, play your own music during games, check to see which 
friends are online during games and communicate with them or join their game, 
you can return to the dashboard from the game or shut down the console itself 
using the button. You can also change your online status, voice settings, setup 
a private chat, access the music player and change your theme, vibration 
settings and notifications using the guide buttons menu. XBOX.COM Sign into 
Xbox.com using your xbox live e-mail and password and a range of options become 
available to you. As well as being able to get the latest news and updates on a 
whole range or Xbox 360 related topics you are able to view your friends that 
are online, send and read messages to / from your friends, add new friends and 
manage your profile. XBOX LIVE VISION CAMERA With the Microsoft Xbox Live 
Vision camera it acts very much in the same way as a webcam, newly added 
features allow for video chats with your friends, the ability to take a 
gamerpicture that only your friends can see and some xbox live arcade games 
like Uno allow you to see yourself and opponents in game. CLEARING THE xBOX 
360'S SYSTEM CACHE Some gamers have found problems with some games not 
starting, or stopping during play and locking up on them. If you get the 3 red 
lights on the system then you'd be better off calling Microsoft's xbox helpline 
but one thing worth trying first is to clear the systems cache as this has been 
known to sort some problems gamers have had with certain games. To clear the 
cache go to the System Blade and select Memory. Highlight the Hard Drive symbol 
and press Y on your control pad. Then press X, X, Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X, 
X. You should receive a message saying maintenance will be performed which will 
clear the systems cache. ------- Errors ------- The 360 has been known to throw 
a wobbler from time to time and stop working so here are a list of some 
possible problems and how they could be resolved. 4 RED SEGMENTS On the front 
of your 360 there is a green ring that lights up when you switch it on. If all 
parts of this turn to red and flash then the console cannot detect the AV 
cable. Make sure that you have it connected and if it is connected remove it 
and try again &#150; if it still doesn't work try another cable then as a last 
resort contact Microsoft's Xbox support to see about getting your console 
fixed. 3 RED SEGMENTS The well known hardware error, this means that some part 
of the hardware isn't working. The 3 red lights will flash. The problem usually 
relates to the power supply, overheating or a fault with one of the hardware 
components. Make sure the power supply is connected properly, that your console 
is in a well ventilated area and doesn't feel to hot at the back too touch. If 
you have been playing for a while then unplug and retry when the console has 
had time to cool down. If it still doesn't work then contact Microsoft's Xbox 
support to see about getting your console fixed. 2 RED SEGMENTS This means the 
console is overheating, again ensure it is in a well ventilated area and switch 
it off and unplug the console and give it time to cool before trying again. 1 
RED SEGMENT This error relates to a known hardware error and the console should 
display the error on the screen. They are usually to do with the DVD drive or 
the hard drive. If it is the hard drive try removing it and ensuring it is 
connected properly and there is no dust at the connectors. Again if you are 
unable to resolve the errors then contact Microsoft's customer support for 
additional help or to get your console repaired. GAME FREEZING Another common 
problem with some 360's is that the game will freeze after a certain amount of 
time spent playing or at a certain point in the game. If you experience a game 
freezing on you there are a few things to try. Make sure the disk is clean and 
scratch free. Restart the console and try again to see if it freezes after a 
certain time or at the same point in the game. If possible try the game in 
another console or try another copy of the game in your console to determine if 
the game or your console is faulty. Try other games in your console to see if 
they do a similar thing. Remove and reconnect the hard drive. The next step 
would be to contact Microsoft's customer support to see about getting your 
console repaired. Hopefully this guide has talked you though most of the 
important features of the Xbox 360 dashboard and provided you with some helpful 
information. <br>
