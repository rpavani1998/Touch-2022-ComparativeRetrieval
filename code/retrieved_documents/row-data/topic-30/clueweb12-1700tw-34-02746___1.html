<p>By Ben Griffin for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Trials Evolution is the ultimate Xbox Live Arcade game. It's mastered over 
dozens of hours, but controls with two buttons - the left stick balances your 
rider and the right trigger revs.</p> <br>
<br>
Watch in HD  No comments yet, 
be the first! <br>

<p>Your aim? To shift, bunny hop and throttle through fiendishly fantastic 
gauntlets made infinitely more exciting thanks to utterly inspired design and 
doubly inspired handling. Developers RedLynx hasn't changed the physics a jolt 
since their 2009 two million-seller Trials HD, and thank god for that because 
it's technically perfect. Like real life, there's no jump button; getting 
airborne is a case of rider positioning, momentum and trajectory. Every action 
- rock, bounce or subtle shift of weight - has an equal and opposite reaction. 
It's a game of infinite precision.</p> 
<p>Remember that as you tear through 57 tracks ranging from countryside rides- 
nothing more taxing than a few steep hills - to wooden roller coasters a mile 
up, a constantly rotating vertiginous playground and collapsing scaffolding 
that spirals up an ancient castle. There's a nod to LIMBO, black and white and 
sharp with saw blades (a few of its gravity shifting puzzles prove an 
inspiration), and a baseball field where a massive bat smashes you for a home 
run. Some last 20 seconds, some 20 minutes, day turning to dusk while you play. 
RedLynx have found their creative vein and pumped it full of Red Bull.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p></p> 
<h3>HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE</h3> 
<p>Wily new ways to main you aside, there's good news for players who in the 
last game smacked their heads on a harsh 'pro's only' barrier. Evolution's 
entirely less punishing than before, except for about ten later levels designed 
for veterans (abandon hope - Inferno returns). Players not after cunningly hard 
platinum medals will crash a lot less, making rides only as frustrating as you 
want them to be. It's impossible to survive, however, the climax of every 
course, cartoonish post-track impacts a cathartic surprise after almost 
unbearable tension. One 'bike-tality' sucks you down a pipe and pumps you 
ass-down on a bathroom stall, while another locks on via periscope and fires 
two torpedoes your way. It's nice to know that despite complex design, nothing 
is taken too seriously.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 Routes can run parallel to the screen or veer between foreground 
and back, but they're locked to a 2D plane; you never have to worry about 
turns, cornering or optimum apexes. It can sometimes confuse, one track 
seemingly set on a collision course with a bevy of exploding barrels only to 
pull up inches before, but the change is a natural evolution, entirely more 
unpredictable and liberated than Trials HD but still a setting an ever-present 
goal to the right, just past the flaming tyre pits and electrified fences. 
There is a little niggle, however, in the way your rider doesn't lean when 
turning. Once spotted it's hard to ignore.

soon (I have just had dispatch notification).</p>
<p>Either way I can't wait to download and play this - definitely the BEST

<p>hahaha - I did the same thing yesterday and strangely enough I got a 
dispatch notification soon afterwards (and yes it was the Easter voucher code

got to wait now for 'Trials' to be available to download</p> </li>

<p>Genius game, really like the new camera which sits a bit further out and 
back than the old one and also the camera pans round giving the impression of a 
track with curves. Lot's to do as always although the tracks are generally 
easier I think than in the first. The ~limbo track is genius, as is 
rollercoaster, gigantus and the one in the clouds. Graphically it is better 
with more going on (though I do miss the closed in feel of some of HD's tracks) 
and the online is great fun though clearly puniches you if you ain't got the 
hang of it yet. Deffo an improvmeent on Trials HD but at the same time it's 
more of the same.</p>
<p>Well worth 1200 points.</p> </li>

<p>I'm just caning through the levels, not giving a s**t about my time at this 
stage (in terms of competing against friends). there is no point in playing the 
courses over and over when I don't have the phoenix evo yet (my bike of choice)
</p>
<p>so far the game seems... ok. Wasn't impressed by the opening music, so the 
first thing I did was go to the option and turn the music volume to zero. the 
game was improved by about 78% from that point on.</p>
<p>the courses are well designed, as expected and the replay value is 
certainly there. The graphics are nice and the physics have (thankfully) been 
left as they were.</p>
<p>Does it make me miserable to actually like the dark warehouses more? Trial 
HD, at this stage, IMO, is better.</p>
<p>I'm sure the viewing angle is different to Trials HD, making it more 
difficult see where the jumps are. It's more angled as opposed to more straight 
on. this isn't being very well explained but, well, it's not quite right.</p>
<p>I also don't like the fact it says 'crash' when you crash. I'd love to turn 
that off.</p>
<p>Overall though I'm sure I'll plough hours into it and it is a bargain for 
1200 points</p> </li>

<p>Aye i thought to begin with that i'd broke the track. Some of the 
checkpoints are spaced well apart so i was riding for a while, faulting, going 
quite a bit back and then thinking &quot;is this right?&quot; should i still be 
here?</p> </li>

That would be on the left trigger. Along with accelerator on the right 
stick gives you the 2 buttons.</p> </li>

<p>Nah. The review says &quot;It's mastered over dozens of hours, but <b>
controls with two buttons - the left stick balances your rider and the right 
trigger revs</b>. Which misses out the break, which is pretty useful at points.
</p>
<p>If he's classing the left stick for balance as a button, then it's three in 
total.</p> </li>

Well obviously the left stick isn't a button, so the review is wrong! 
He also says that you can't make your own skill games in the video review, 
which is also wrong, although I think he corrects himself.<br>
Its funny how he 
can't pronounce &quot;homage&quot; properly as well </p>
<p>EDIT: Just noticed I said &quot;right stick&quot; in my original comment. 
Obviously that should be right trigger.</p> </li> </ol>
