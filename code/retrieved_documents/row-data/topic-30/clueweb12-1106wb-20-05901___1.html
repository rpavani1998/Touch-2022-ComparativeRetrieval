drop shot to the standard intensafire 3.0?'  &quot;As far as I know you have to 
buy the HS version pre-installed in a controller by a select group of companies 
that carry the HS mod. If the rules have changed about this I am unaware of 
it.&quot;<br>

wanted to by a MW3 controller anyway. Where can I get the HS version? The only 
place I've seen is on ebay a 1 store.&quot;<br>

only buy the HS version with BGRMods and the board has to be a CG you can see 
what the CG controller's look like here
