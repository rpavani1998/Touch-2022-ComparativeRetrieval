<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Polytron has announced a Friday, April 13 release date for 2D platform 
puzzler Fez.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 Originally due for release in 2009 but delayed on multiple 
occasions, the Xbox Live Arcade game will set you back 800 Microsoft Points 
(&pound;6.85).
<p></p> 
<p>Last year co-creator Phil Fish suggested that the title had been heavily 
influenced by classic Nintendo games. However, when asked if there was any 
chance of it actually appearing on a Nintendo console,he was less than positive.
</p> 
<p>Here's Xbox.com's Fez description:</p> 
<p><i>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the 
existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out 
on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space.</i></p> 
<p><i>Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from four distinct classic 2D 
perspectives. Explore a serene and beautiful open-ended world full of secrets, 
puzzles and hidden treasures. Unearth the mysteries of the past and discover 
the truth about reality and perception. Change your perspective and look at the 
world in a different way.</i></p> <br>

<p>Seems odd Microsoft aren't marketing this like crazy or putting it in one 
of those XBLA promotions.<br>
It is still going to sell bucket loads but still 
I'd like to have seen it get some hefty promotion.</p> </li>

<p>Thanks guys! When I like a Game, I really do go all out guns blazing for it 
(See Alan Wake &amp; Fez to confirm my long, protracted craziness).</p>
<p>Its been a long process and I have actually been following this Game for 
almost 4 years! Its made by just two guys, so its a proper<i>Indie Game</i>, 
and I would implore everyone to at least try the demo, its the least you could 
do  .</p>
<p>&pound;16 for 2100 MS points, download both Fez and Trials, have a few MS 
points left over and you should have the best Gaming investment since The 
Orange Box!</p>
<p>Buy Fez people, look at my Avatar! You see. How can you not buy it  ?</p>

<p>I'm there. I'm not sure why but I'm there. I know next to nothing about the 
game but it looks too intriguing for me to pass up. Reasonably priced too.</p>

<p>I actually enjoyed Alan Wake. I do wish they had kept with their early plan 
of having it open world though. I would have scored it a 7.5 out of 10.</p>

<p><br>
Heresy!!! Very average Ric? That hurt like a bullet to the heart or an 
arrow to the knee  .</p>
<p>Alan Wake was a fantastic experience, as anyone who has played it will 
testify too.</p>
<p>Fez is a different kettle of fish though. This is going to be the Best Game 
released on Live this year, YES, even better than Trials (but just by a wee 
bit).</p> </li>

<p>I would have stayed, but then you said Fez was going to be better than 
Trials...which even though purely subjective, is just plain wrong, and you 
cannot be allowed to perpetuate such vile untruths in the world. There are too 
many innocents who could be unduly influenced by your heinous propoganda. For 
shame.</p>
<p>Can you get wrecked on Microsoft Points these days? I've got a few spare, 
might pop down the offie..</p> </li>

<p>I remember seeing you demand this game aaaaages back, Stonecold- think you 
left a link to some gameplay footage and that was it- I thought it looked 
awesome. I won't be hesitating to get it.</p>
<p>Also: Alan Wake was a great game. God told me so.</p> </li>

<p>I'm gonna get this and trials. The only arcade games I've been interested 
in for ages.</p>
<p>Loving the platforming genre again at the moment, all thanks to the 
incredibly underrated Rayman Returns, which is absolute brilliance... it's like 
playing a cartoon!! You can probably pick it up for &pound;15 now as well. Well 
worth it.</p> </li>

<p>Fair enough then, <b>I stand corrected</b>. Trials Evolution, <b>will</b> 
be the best Game on XBLA this year. You see, you see  ?</p>

<p>Good Stonecold, good. Now I can rest easy knowing Trials is best, I already 
knew that of course, but now you saying it has reassured me. God bless, one and

<p>This Looks interesting... Indie devs seem to be keeon on making platformers 
which I am glad about!! Also I enjoyed alan wake but it did get a bit 
repetitive, but it's chapters were just the right length to not make it become 
overly so. And the music at the end of each chapter was genius.</p> </li> </ol>
