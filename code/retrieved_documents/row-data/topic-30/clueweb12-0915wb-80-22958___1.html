<p>By CVG Staff for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>A secret triple-A title set to be 'reborn' on Xbox 360 has been cheekily 
teased in the latest issue of OXM UK.</p> 
<p>However, there's bad news for 360 owners wishing for the full reveal of the 
blockbuster game any time soon - as it's been pushed back by a month.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 The exclusive has been nodded to on the 'Next Month' page of 
OXM issue 70, which is in stores now.
<p></p> 
<p>It reads: &quot;You WILL buy this magazine... One of the best games ever 
made is reborn on Xbox 360.&quot;</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like readers will have to wait until OXM issue 72, 
which will hit stores in April, to find out what it is - as the game's 
publisher has pushed back its announcement.</p> 
<p>  [Update: OXM editor Jon Hicks has since told us that, due to the game's 
publisher pushing back its announcement, the planned reveal &quot;is very 
unlikely to appear in the magazine for the forseeable future&quot;. Boo.]</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, OXM issue 71 will hit stores on March 10.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's a real nuisance, not least since we've been trying to cover this 
game for months, but these things happen,&quot; OXM editor Jon Hicks told CVG. 
&quot;The publisher was very apologetic but apparently the game just won't be 
ready in time.&quot;</p> 
<p>Take a look at the graphics on the page. It looks futuristic, possibly 
science fiction-esque.</p> 
<p>Which doesn't really narrow it down too much in the world of video games. 
What do you reckon it could be, readers?</p> computerandvideogames.com <br>

<p>Yeah I didn't notice that they were desk and not tables so I agree with it 
being an office and not a hotel as I thought. I reckon it is more likely to be 
S.W.A.T than R6 though seeing that Acti don't have any squad based shooters 
barring the zombie mode in COD.</p> </li>

<p>Look at the graphics on the page... what, you mean that bloody blueprint of 
a building of some sort? That could be anything from the new X -Com to Theme 
bloody Hospital. My money would be on the former rather than the latter 
though.If they'd been trying to cover the game for months, then it's most 
probably a game that was already shown in some form long ago. If all it ends up 
being is a Halo Remake or HD release of Halo then... this will have to be one 
of the most boring reveals ever.</p> </li>

<p>I doubt they'd make such a fuss over the Halo remake as it seems to be 
pretty common knowledge that it is going to happen at some point. Then again, 
magazines hype up these things to more than they deserve.</p>
<p>If it's a Halo remake, then great, but it wouldn't be that exciting.</p>
<p>Elite, on the other hand, would be very exciting indeed!</p>
<p>And I think people need to give up on the Shemnue dream. Sadly...</p> </li>

<p>I highly doubt it will be Halo, since the studio developing the new Halo 
has said it is not a prequel, but a continuation of the Halo franchise.</p>
<p>Anyway, im hoping its Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, we saw a tech demo not too 
long ago about it -- and they're are slight rumours that we're going to see an 
announcement for it this year. Heres hoping ~</p> </li>

Halo 2<br>
KOTOR<br>
Star Wars Battlefront<br>

<p>Should we be analyzing the white dots at all? There are 9. 10 would make 
sense for a Halo 1 remake(10 years). Perhaps I'm looking into it a bit too 
much...</p>
<p>As for the background, I thought it was a circuit board at first, but 
zooming in I guess it could be a large room/office. Blueprints would make more 
sense.</p> </li>

<p>Yeah, I think you're bang on the money with that one. I'm sure there was a 
story a couple of months ago about a trademark or something for syndicate being 
in discussion with the original publishers or such like. Considering the remake 
is being described as being of &quot;one of the greatest games of all 
time&quot; then Syndicate's probably the most obvious candidate from those 
mentioned so far.</p> </li>

<p>AAA Exclusives were something the original Xbox had a lot of.</p>
<p>AAA Exclusives are something Microsoft has access to that we actually 
didn't even see on the original Xbox.</p>
<p>If Microsoft is referring to a &quot;remake&quot; of an original Xbox game, 
I think it could be anything from Mechwarrior, to Star Wars: KOTOR, to Halo: 
Combat Evolved.</p>
<p>But remember, Microsoft could also be talking about something like a game 
that has been rumored for quite some time based on one of the most popular 
arcade games EVER:</p>
<p>Killer Instinct!!!</p> </li>

<p>I remember Rainbow Six on the PS1 used a blueprint for a map and white 
squares were used as the terrorist icon....could that be the magazine cover 
image?  Heres a video with the map in it shown at 2:31

<p>Well my money is on Syndicate. Look at the background. It's a circuit 
board, very similar to the one on the original box art.</p>
<p>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/Syndicate_Coverart.png</p>
<p>Also it has been rumoured to be in development for a while now.</p>
<p>then again i could be right and it is actually How to be a complete bastard.

<p>Yo good call on Syndicate man. It definitely looks like it could be from 
that game. Also I heard EA are working on a remake of it my money would be on 
that. Man I played that game hard on my Amiga 1200 ah memory's..</p> </li>

<p>The background is an architectural plan for a building entrance like a 
corporate headquarters with security swipe card stations to get in - sounds 
like syndicate to me</p> </li>
