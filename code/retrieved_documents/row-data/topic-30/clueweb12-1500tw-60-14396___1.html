<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Sony is teasing a PlayStation reveal scheduled for next Thursday, and we're 
pinning our hopes on a new God of War game.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 The company posted the image to the right on the PlayStation 
Facebookpage. It reads: &quot;Will vengeance bring redemption? 04.19.12.&quot; 
The word &quot;vengeance&quot; smacks of God of War talk to us, and is that 
blood splatter on the image?
<p></p> 
<p>Evidence of an imminent God of War 4 reveal has been piling up for some 
time now. The unannounced game has appeared ona number of CVs and been listed 
by multiple retailers.</p> 
<p>Recently a retailer attending Sony's invite-only Destination PlayStation 
event teased an imminent God of War reveal through Twitter. This same retailer 
also said a kart racing game based on the LittleBigPlanet franchise was on the 
way, and we allknow how that turned out.</p> 
<p>Ready at Dawn, the studio behind the numerous excellent PSP God of War 
titles, recently is currently working on a new project, although it'sbelieved 
to be for next-gen systems a PlayStation Vita entry in the series could be on 
the cards too.</p> <br>

I'm sure you'd be saying that if it was a Nintendo exclusive.</p>
<p>Hopefully it is and hopefully it'll be a different setting maybe?</p> </li>

<p>Bring on God of War IV!!!</p>
<p>God of War is Sony's most beloved franchise, God of War III is probably the 
best game ever made and has set records as the most critically acclaimed and 
best-selling game in the genre of all time, God of War IV will be magnificent.
</p>
<p>Devil May Cry &amp; Ninja Gaiden were never good and are dead now, God of 
War is the pinnacle of the genre as it by miles has the best combat, story, 
graphics, boss fights, difficulty curve, set-pieces, pacing, ost, fun, depth 
etc,... God of War represents perfection in the genre that none of the other 
games can come close too. No other hack n' slash game aside from the awesome 
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is even worth mentioning, so move aside and make 
way for the king of the hack n' slash genres return... GOD OF WAR IV!!!!</p>

<p>Hopefully if it is a GoW, it's starting something new like CVG's idea a 
while ago. Instead of it continuing with Kratos or the Greek Gods, have 
something else in another time, like Norse mythology.</p>
<p>And Bruce, ever heard of personal taste or opinion? In mine, you're a close 
minded clod.</p> </li>

gore please !</p> </li>
