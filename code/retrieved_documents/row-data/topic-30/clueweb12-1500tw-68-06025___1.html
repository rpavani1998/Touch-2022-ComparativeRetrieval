<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>In a footnote to today's announcement of official Kinect support for The 
Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Bethesda made some mention of upcoming DLC for the 
game.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 &quot;Bethesda Game Studios has been hard at work on creating 
the first set of game add-ons that will beexclusive to the Xbox 360 video game 
and entertainment system from Microsoft,&quot; it said.
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;This additional content will add new quests, locations, features, and 
much more to the world of Skyrim. Stay tuned, we hope to officially announce 
what it is soon.&quot;</p> 
<p>In February Skyrim game director Todd Howard hinted at potential Skyrim DLC 
by showing off some of the fruits of the company's week-long 'Game Jam', an 
annual tradition that lets developers at the studio go wild with their 
imaginations on company time.</p> 
<p>In December he also said Skyrim DLC will focus on &quot;ways to make the 
game better, not just have more, because the game is so big&quot;. As with 
Bethesda's previous titles, there'll be multiple DLC packs with &quot;a lot of 
meat on them&quot;.</p> 
<p>Here's what we want to see from Skyrim DLC. What do you want to see?</p>

<p>It would be nice if Bethesda offered this &quot;add-on&quot; at a 
discounted rate or even for free as compensation to PS3 owners for putting up 
with a broken game for six months.</p>

<p>Good stuff, I have barely found half the locations though 2 months later. 
Timed exclusives are bulls**t, but I don't care either way. They have money to 
waste so let them do it.</p> </li>

<p>I, too, would hope for more Shivering Isles than Mothership Zeta. Even 
something like Knights of the Nine would be pretty decent, I just don't want 
them to take the route they did with most of the Fallout 3 DLC again - with one 
or two exceptions most of it was poor.</p> </li>

<p>I see what you did there!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, is 30-day exclusivity that big a deal I wonder? The 
Fallout 3 DLC deal seemed more agonising for my PS3-only brethren, seeing as it 
was much longer.</p> </li>

<p>So I buy the ps3 version and get a near unplayable game and now I have to 
either wait an extended amount of time or maybe not even get this DLC at all? 
Harsh man!</p> </li>

It's helped it heaps, but it's not perfect. Atleast it's possible to 
run through a town now.</p> </li>

<p>I dunno, i think a spaceship crashing into skyrim would be pretty epic. 
Then again the length of mothership zeta was a little lacking. I too would 
prefer a full fledged expansion to the episodes that fallout and new vegas got,

<p>Its perfectly playable since the 1.4 patch, I started play February 26 and 
platinumed the game is about 100hours with only one crash the whole time, some 
frame rate issues but nothing major or game breaking. It certainly ran a lot 
better than both Fallout 3 and New Vegas even after they where patched.</p>
<p>It plays and it works now, stop perpetuating the myth this game is still 
broken when you clear know nothing.</p> </li> </ol>
