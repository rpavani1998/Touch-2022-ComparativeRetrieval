<p>By Tamoor Hussain for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Alan Wake might be the talk of the town but little is known about his 
re-emergence on Xbox Live Arcade. Fortunately,Xbox World magazine has delivered 
a sprawling eight-page feature chalk-full of details on the flannel-clad 
writer's newest nightmare.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 According to the mag, Alan Wake's American Nightmare draws 
thematic and narrative inspiration from pulp action-adventures such as From 
Dusk 'Til Dawn and other Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez material.
<p></p> 
<p>The XBLA follow-up is a return to Alan Wake's open-world roots, featuring a 
hub structure which will see players returning to locations multiple times 
during the story. The game is described as &quot;significantly bigger than any 
episode of the original game.&quot;</p> 
<p>American Nightmare takes place two years after the events of the original 
game. Since saving Alice, his perpetually in danger other half, and confining 
himself to the 'Dark Place' beneath Cauldron Lake Alan has become an 
urban-legend.</p> 
<p>In his absence fans of the writer have re-imagined him as a Candyman of 
sorts, the legend goes that Alan vanished into the woods of Bright Falls and 
returned as Mr Scratch, a maniacal serial killer.</p> 
<p>Like all good urban myths uttering Mr Scratch's name a few too many times 
is rumored to summon him, and since things have a way of mysteriously coming 
true in Alan's world, the evil doppleganger has manifested and is on his way to 
finish Alice off, leaving a trail of bodies and video evidence of his murderous 
activities for Alan to find.</p> <br>
<br>

first! <br>

<p>During the game players will learn what became of Alice, as well as Alan's 
agent Barry, after the events of the first game through new manuscript pages, 
TVs and radios, Xbox World reveals.</p> 
<p>Although it still relies on the same combat mechanics as the original game, 
enemies now respond to Alan's light-based attacks in different ways that force 
him to switch up his tactics. A new crossbow weapon which can pierce through 
the darkness protecting enemies has been introduced, along with and Uzis, 
military-grade rifles and a nailgun, which Alan can use to overwhelm his foes.
</p> 
<p>For the full eight-page feature on Alan Wake's American Nightmare pick up 
Xbox World magazine issue 113, which also includes an exclusive look at Rainbow 
Six Patriots.</p>

<p>Sounds good and i'm chuffed that the manuscripts, radio and TV stations 
return because i loved searching for them in AW. Let's just hope that Alan's 
writing is a bit better this time, eh?</p> </li>

<p>Not had a chance to play Alan Wake yet, but from what I've read/heard, it's 
a mixed bag. But when you look at stuff like Resident Evil, Silent Hill and 
Dead Rising, the amount of stuff that's out there, people are getting a bit 
sick of this genre, more so Resident Evil which I think CAPCOM had ruined. 
American Nightmare has a lot weight on its shoulders, but I can't see how it's 
going change things, but it'll be decent. Gaming hit a brick wall years ago, 
mass lack of imagination.</p> </li>

<p>While I'm not a supporter of developers releasing full games as download 
only titles I'm really looking forward to this. It also reminds me I haven't 
played the DLC for the original yet, I should really Remedy that.</p> </li>

Difference is AW is not about zombies or a horror game. Its a 
story-driven action game in the psychological thriller genre</p> </li>
