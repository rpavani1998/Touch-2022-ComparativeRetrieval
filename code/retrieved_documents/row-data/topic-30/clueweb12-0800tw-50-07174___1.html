<p>By CVG Staff for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>On last week's mailbox Roger Sandbakk asked if we really need yet another 
Mario and Zelda from Nintendo.</p> 
<p>This week David Anderson got in touch to draw an interesting comparison 
between the used video game market and the used car market and ask why 
customers are being charged for features that are part of the original package 
when buying used.</p> 
<p>To have your letter featured on CVG's Mailbox, drop us a line.</p> 
<p><em>I was in my local games shop, when I overheard a young lad asking the 
assistant for a copy of Battlefield 3. He was asked if would he like a new copy 
or a secondhand one, that was ten quid cheaper. Obviously he chose the latter 
and was told that he'd have to buy an online pass to play over Xbox Live. He 
grumbled about this as he made his purchase.</em></p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p><em>I've always thought games developers are well within their rights to 
try and make money from secondhand games, considering how much work goes into 
developing modern games. I think this is especially important in the current 
economic climate. However as I was driving home I passed a number of car sales 
garages.</em></p> 
<p><em>I'm pretty sure second-hand cars have been sold for many years. I don't 
think that purchasers of these used vehicles, myself included, have had to pay 
the original manufacturers any money to have the engine start, the wheels to 
turn or for it to be driven out of the county. You can also buy many other 
secondhand goods with no contribution to whoever made them in the first place.
</em></p> 
<p><em>This led me to the question: should the gaming industry be allowed to 
charge for features in the original</em></p> 
<p><em>product just because you choose to buy used? What makes the gaming 
industry different from others?</em></p> 
<p><b>XBW says:</b> Good point David, but there are a few gaps in your 
argument. First off, developers have to pay for servers to run online games, 
which costs money. Three or four people could potentially play the same copy of 
Battlefield 3 (for example) online, but without the online pass system DICE 
would only get the cash from one of them.</p> 
<p>To bring this back to your car comparison: once you drive away in a 
second-hand car, it doesn't cost the original manufacturer a penny. In fact, 
they'll still make money from you when you buy new parts for your second-hand 
car. We're not totally behind the 'Online Pass' system, but can see the sense 
behind it if the game in question justifies the expense.</p> 
<p>So, Battlefield 3; fair enough, servers are expensive. Dragon Age with 
locked quests for preowned buyers? Not so much.</p> 
<p><b>CVG says:</b> XBW hit the nail on the head, there's a strong argument to 
be made for having to charge so sustain servers for multiplayer games. The 
problem arises when single-player games start using online passes, but so far 
we can't think up any examples of significant content being locked away behind 
online passes, it's all bonus DLC. So we're alright with it for now...</p>

<p>I wouldn't be that bothered about buying an online pass if it was a little 
cheaper 8 quid is a bit much, i used to enjoy browsing pre owned games, now i 
have to search every inch of the box to make sure it dosent have a pass, and if 
it does i then have to look for new, and once i realise the new copy is usually 
bout a tenner more i put the game back go home and find it cheaper than pre 
owned on Amazon or ebay for brand new.</p> </li>

<p>I have no problem in developers making money from the games however they 
already have the full price tag when the first person purchased it.</p>
<p>I have also noticed ever since with the online pass system has been in 
place, some new games (sealed) are cheaper than second hand games.</p> </li>

<p>The analogy isn't appropriate. Manufacturers have the ability to gain a 
little extra money from selling used cars through their own dealerships, not 
just independents. Developers and publishers get no cash whatsoever from the 
resale of their games.</p>
<p>Also, the sale of a car through an independent dealer costs the 
manufacturer nothing at all, so unless you are comparing it to a single-player 
only experience then it doesn't mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Publishers and the developers sell the game at a fixed price knowing that 
most people's use of the online services will diminish over time. That's what 
they plan for and that's why games are not a hell of a lot more expensive than 
they are. If that copy then gets sold on, their server usage doesn't diminish 
as expected without the additional revenue, and they start to lose money. It 
might annoy you as a customer, but you would be far more annoyed if you were in 
their shoes - paying out for people to play games online when they haven't paid 
you anything.</p>
<p>I think the current model of allowing used games to play single-player for 
free and charge for an online pass is fair. Playing a used game single-player 
costs them nothing (well...arguably it does them out of some sales), but to 
continue to use online services without the developer seeing any money is wrong.
</p>
<p>That said, I would argue that it is not necessarily the purchaser of the 
used game that is in the wrong, and it is the retailer middle-man who owes the 
developers a cut of their profits.</p> </li>

<p>I'd say yes.<br>
I'm in favour of pre-owned games, due to the fact that 
buying a video game means we OWN our copy of it and have the right to do what 
we want with it, including selling it. However, it's obviously understandable 
that developers are annoyed by it as they don't earn any money for it, and of 
course in their eyes, if the pre-owned game market didn't exist, everyone would 
have to buy new copies.<br>
Allowing games to be sold and bought again but 
putting charges in for certain features is probably the best solution anyone 
will ever come up with, a compromise that should at least satisfy both sides of 
the argument.</p> </li>

<p>Preowned, what a s**t word.</p>
<p>Second hand is the proper word, once you get past the corporate b*****ks.
</p>
<p>It's perfectly legal, supports the bricks and mortar shops and is at worst 
a transfer of ownership.</p>
<p>These publishers need to get real.</p> </li>

<p> What a load of f**king b*****ks!! Those 3 or 4 people aren't playing at 
the same time!! Not only that these people help keep the online side of the 
game alive.</p> </li>

<p>No, there shouldn't be a charge to unlock features if you bought pre-owned, 
end of story in my book.<br>
The article mentions what ought to be the 
overriding point in this argument:<br>
<b>Most other industries have a second 
hand market. No other industries do this. If you've bought a copy you should be 
able to do what you want with it, including selling all of it on. That's how 
free trade works.</b></p>
<p>If publishers want to be petty about 'online server maintenance costs' then 
I can be petty too. Gamers that get their game pre-owned might still buy DLC, 
they'll be a lot more likely to buy any sequels new and the publishers have 
already been paid once for the online maintenance costs of any copy by the 
original buyer who got it new, i.e. pre-owned doesn't increase the number of 
copies so it can't increase the number of players potentially playing online at 
any one point.<br>
Also when you buy an online pass you aren't even necessarily 
getting dedicated servers, you don't even know if you'll like the multiplayer 
of the game or whether it still has an online community because you don't get a 
chance to try it and if you're a 360 owner you've also got to pay for Xbox Live 
Gold as well (which as far as I understand is also supposed to be covering 
'online server maintenance costs').</p>
<p>Truth is the difference between the games industry and other industries is 
just that the games industry has found a way to try and get money out of second 
hand buyers and some publishers are happy to exploit it.</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The problem arises when single-player games start using online passes, but 
so far we can't think up any examples of significant content being locked away 
behind online passes, it's all bonus DLC.</p> </blockquote>
<p><br>
The Catwoman sections of Arkham City's the obvious example. It was 
developed alongside the main game, they advertised it as part of the main game 
at E3 and then ultimately they left it off the disc to punish pre-owned gamers 
and leave offline gamers with no way of getting it even if they bought new.<br>

Sometimes bonus DLC is something devs have been working on since the game went 
gold and they started burning discs, a lot of the time it isn't and bonus DLC 
is just a nice way of saying 'content we're holding back because we don't give 
a damn about our customers'.</p>
<p><b>Would you like to make a counter-argument to the points me and others 
are making CVG/XBW?</b><br>
I can't shake the feeling you're sitting on the 
fence on this issue a bit rather than criticising publishers and sticking up 
for your readers.</p> </li>

<p>I've stated it many times before and I'll state it here as well: The 
computer/video games &amp; IT software industry-at-large should be treated the 
same way every other industry is. Full stop. It doesn't matter that they can 
fiddle with some code and thus artificially limit customers' access to their 
product - be it first or second hand. Just because you can do something doesn't 
mean you should nor that you have the legal right to do so.</p>
<p>The game companies are acting like petulant, spoiled children that want 
everything their way. Grow up and get real. They do not deserve special 
treatment and they should not receive any either.</p> </li>

<p>Um Catwoman DLC for Arkham City? That was pretty much the same system.</p>
<p>The gaming industry shouldn't get any special treatment when it comes to 
second hand games. If anything, knowing our favourite publishers who just love 
money, they'll just use it for further expolits.</p> </li>

<p>It's all well and good saying that the game preowned market should be 
treated like any otherproduct, but the multiplayer element is not just a 
product but aservice too. As I said before, these companies price their games 
and budget their work and resources (both pre and post release) around the 
model of diminishing online play (overall). They have to, otherwise they would 
either have to continue to provide this service with no revenue stream to pay 
for it, or they would charge per month as per the MMO model. The preowned 
market encourages higher use with no extra cash to pay for the service.</p>
<p>Buying second hand to play a game offline, directly P2P with no server 
assistance, or any other useage that doesn't require the developer to provide a 
service at a cost to them is fine and can all be deemed the 
&quot;product&quot;. But outside of that is a service, with the amount of 
effort that goes into making games these days, it's not fair to the developers 
and is ever more unsustainable. No other service would work that way.</p>
<p>The options are to charge to unlock the multiplayer on a preowned game, or 
for them to start charging per month for all people to play their individual 
game online.</p> </li>
