<p>By Tom Ivan for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>The next Xbox console may also be a digital video recorder, according to a 
recently granted Microsoft patent.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 Spotted by Kotaku, the patent perhaps hints at the next step in 
the platform holder's strategy to create a true media hub fusing TV, films, 
internet and games.
<p></p> 
<p>Originally filed in 2007, and approved by the US Patent &amp; Trademark 
Office on December 27 last year, patent # 8,083,593describes:</p> 
<p><em>A digital video recorder (DVR) application running alongside a 
television client component allows users to record media content on the gaming 
console. The DVR application also integrates itself with the console menu.</em>
</p> 
<p><em><em>Once integrated, users can record media content while playing 
games. Alternatively, users can record content when the gaming console is 
turned off. The recorded content can include television programming, gaming 
experience (whether local or online), music, DVDs, and so on. When in the 
recording state, users can also switch between various other media modes, 
whether gaming, television, and so on.</em></em></p> 
<p>Microsoft promised to usher in &quot;a new era in television&quot; with the 
addition of content on Xbox 360 from almost 40 TV and entertainment suppliers 
following the introduction of the console's new dashboard last month.</p> 
<p>It's also reportedly seeking a television executive to head up the creation 
of original Xbox Live TV content.</p> <br>

<p>Anyone who has been using the new Xbox dashboard can see that this is the 
End Game for MS. They really want to control what you watch and how you watch 
it in your living room.</p>
<p>Being able to record TV would be a positive, but to be able to record Game 
time and such like would be a welcome bonus!</p>
<p>MS is watching you (us!)</p> </li>

<p>Sounds like a great addition if true but they will need to ship the console 
with far more than 320gb storage. Or get rid of the stupid overpriced propriety 
HDD then people can slap in their own HDD with the size (and cost) they desire.

<p>To be expected really, 10 year old technology in the next gen of super

<p>One question, will they allow people to remove the saved data or will it 
have to stay on the console?</p> </li>

<p>For me this is whats really gonna make me choose between this or the next 
ps4.</p>
<p>ps3 had nailed it with the bluray player and the hard drive. (at release)
</p>
<p>I do think the xbox have the presentation on lockdown, which for me is 
leading the race. - If it has bluray support and 3D, then im in.</p>
<p>Otherwise is a sony and nintendo affair.</p> </li>

<p>I'm guessing a 1TB HDD if they want it to be a DVR also. And is that triple 
core or 6 core processor? </p>
<p>As for Blu-Ray I can't see Microsoft wanting to licence tech from a 
consortium which there chief rivals are one of the key players </p>
<p>More like a new format like Wii-U so they don;t have to pay licensing fee's 
or they buy the rights to Toshiba's defunct HD-DVD format.</p> </li>

<p>It's really not a surprise is it? With the way they've been going over the 
last couple of years... as long as none of this takes away from the 'proper' 
games, which unfortunately in terms of exclusives, it has for me on the 360 
lately. MS have copied the Wii's style so blatantly with elements of the NXE 
and avatars, and now they're trying the all in one media solution that Sony 
pushed about five years ago.</p>
<p>I can't see Sony being part of the BR consortium being a problem for MS. 
They were also part of the DVD consortium and MS didn't have a problem with 
using that tech, plus Windows on VAIO laptops etc etc. They'll go with 
whichever they think will enable them to make the most money.</p> </li>

<p>I expect Sonys new machine will also feature pretty much the same sort of 
thing. After all both Sony and MS have been talking up media connected boxes 
(The one box to rule them all) since the announcements of the 360 and PS3.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who is a bit concerned about consoles becoming too heavy 
in the multimedia 'living room' market?</p>
<p>E3 for Microsoft was concerning to watch. It felt like the actual games 
were being treated like an additional feature. You look at E3 in 2007 and it 
was all about the games and now you go on to your Xbox and all the orignal 
dashboard features like my games list and marketplace are so badly placed and 
the navigation is quite annoying. Give me the old simple blue dashboard any day.

<p>DVD was already well established tech by then it would have been really 
stupid to not use it, Blu-ray was and still is pretty brand new not to mention 
MS had their rival with HD-DVD which failed It maybe would be to hard for them 
to swallow their pride and sign up to use blu-ray even if it meant a benefit 
for the Xbox consumer but who knows maybe they will sign up for it but i have 
my doubts.</p> </li>

<p><br>
But they don't clutter up anything! I have a decent glass TV stand 
that is more than big enough for all my boxes!<br>
Also there's the fact that 
putting everything in one unit means that if anything goes wrong with it I'm 
left with no TV, no movies and no games console till it gets fixed.<br>
Plus 
there is always sacrifices made when combining everything into one unit. My 
TiVo box does Youtube, but not as well as my laptop. My laptop does TV, but not 
as well as the TiVo box. My phone does games, but not as well as my Xbox. Soon 
my Xbox will be able to do Facebook and Youtube and Twitter and movies and TV 
and music and MSN and video-chat.... but not as good as the other products I 
own which were designed just for those purposes.<br>
Indeed, &quot;could&quot; 
is the operative word. In the same way that I &quot;could&quot; enter the 
London marathon. Just because I could do it doesn't mean I'd do a very good job 
of it.</p> </li>

Thats not really a very good comparison. When Playstation 2 was 
released, not many people had DVD players in their houses. In fact PS2s were 
many peoples first DVD players and were one of the major factors in the rise of 
popularity for the DVD format. In this case blu-ray is already in a lot more 
homes that DVD was back then. PS3 has already done all the work in making 
blu-ray popular much in the same way PS2 did for DVD. There is no reason for 
Microsoft to avoid using blu-ray in the same way they didn't avoid using DVD 
for the original Xbox.</p> </li>

<p>It's not a million miles away from the PS3 PlayTV, that is a fantastic PVR 
for recording freeview. IF MS do it well and Sony do it again for the PS4, I'll 
have no complaints.</p>
<p>All-in-one boxes are fine with me, I'd much prefer a good home hub for 
games, video and music than have 5 boxes under the TV. And if the price is 
under &pound;400, then that's cool with me.</p> </li>

<p>TBH all i want my console to do is play games, nothing else. If you start 
using it for other stuff, it will wear out fast, and why I play Blu-rays on my 
blu-player, dvds on my dvd player, etc, to share the load and extend the 
lifespan of the item.</p>
<p>Also, if the next gen systems come out in 2013, then I won't be getting it 
until late 2014 and any problems have been ironed out and the price 
considerably less. Plus, there are still so many games to play on the current 
gen systems any will be until the new ones come around.</p> </li>

<p>.... and this is apparently the future of Xbox?? I CAN ALREADY DO ALL THE 
ABOVE ON MY PS3!!</p>
<p>I have a 320Gb SATA hard-drive purchased from Amazon for &pound;45 (can't 
do that for the Xbox 360) and I have a copy of PlayTV which I managed to pick 
up off ebay for &pound;30, I have all the normal freeview channels and digital 
radio.<br>
The best thing being that I am able to record at anytime, I am then 
able to copy the video file to a memory stick and watch it on my friends or 
family&#146;s PC... in fact the only system I am not able to view the video 
file on is the Xbox 360, surprise, surprise!</p>
<p>Sounds like the Xbox 720 is trying to be more like a Playstation 3 if you 
ask me, shame its five years to late. </p> </li>

<p>I mean if DVR was so defunct then why are both Virgin and Sky promoting it

<p> I've Sky+ as well and haven't used it in months. Everything on Sky is 
repeated umpteen times so you'll never miss a thing anyway. It was handy for 
pausing live TV but my TV does that now. This will be handy for recording game 
play but for recording TV... not needed.</p> </li>

<p>Virgin's catch up and on demand service is terrible here in Northern 
Ireland. They still stream their digital content through old cabling that was 
laid by CableTel back in the mid 90's. Mine has a crash at least once a week 
and sometimes you can't even access the services. That's why DVR is so handy 
because the footage is stored on the local drive and not streamed via cabling.

Final starts?</p> </blockquote>
<p> Not going to happen. If I missed a live football match then I'm either 
doing something more important or I'm not interested in the teams playing. If 
it's a film or program then I'll watch it on the catch up service or wait until 
it comes round again on the channel.</p> </li>

<p>For me it sounds very familiar, let me guess, it also plays games?</p>
<p>The PVR sounds good, but my TV does it already. </p>
<p>For me, it will depend on killer new IP's that are not shooters, for me to 
be interested in a new xbox!</p> </li>

<p>I record quite a bit on my Media Centre PC - mainly live footy, Match of 
the Day, films etc. You get some BBC films on iplayer, but not on other 
channels and I don't have Sky/Virgin.</p>
<p>A PVR isn't high on my list of needs on a games console, and to some degree 
iplayer etc has made TV recording less important, but I wouldn't say it's 
pointless just because I wouldn't use it that much. There are lots of features 
on my consoles that I don't use, but it's good they're there for the people 
that do.</p> </li>

<p>Please just make a powerful console, leave all the crap out to reduce 
costs. I haven't watched any tv for the past 6 or 7 years, as many people don't 
watch tv, just a console with blurry player is all I want. Make it with at 
least 2G ram please. Make it under &pound;300 or it is a no buy to me, as 
there's plenty of games for the ps3 and wii to keep me entertained for the next 
few years.</p> </li>

<p>everyone seems to be missing a key thing here allow xbox to record tv then 
you dont need a disk drive also means you will have more bits and bobs in the 
case to cause heat so possible heating issues</p>
<p>the ps3 is poor at being a media hub my sony tv does a better job the psn 
is far too slow to do anything</p>
<p>reguards to ondemand side i have been using sky player from day 1 and have 
never had a problem with it even on the xbox</p>
<p>my windows pc does a better job as a media hub than the tv or the xbox or 
the ps3</p>
<p>i bought the ps3 for lovefilm but now use the xbox or the pc for it </p>
<p>i cant see ms choosing to use the blueray format also it is far too slow to 
warrant it and if the new hd format does come earlier than expected then 
blu-rau may be outed and if the new gen consoles are looking to stay arround 
for a while you may find that neither have blu-ray/dvd built in and would be 
sold as an add on</p> </li>

<p>its just pure greed from microsoft thay want to control everything and 
adding features like a pvr to the next xbox is a mistake in my opinion, by 
adding features like the pvr it will be to the detriment of the gaming side of 
the console, there is only so much processor power to go around leave the xbox 
to what its good at playing games.</p> </li>

<p>Am I the only one who is a bit concerned about consoles becoming too heavy 
in the multimedia 'living room' market?</p> 
<p>E3 for Microsoft was concerning to watch. It felt like the actual games 
were being treated like an additional feature. You look at E3 in 2007 and it 
was all about the games and now you go on to your Xbox and all the orignal 
dashboard features like my games list and marketplace are so badly placed and 
the navigation is quite annoying. Give me the old simple blue dashboard any day.
</p> </blockquote>
<p>Yes, I agree that games functionality should be paramount, although 
multimedia functions are also a pleasant addition. It's also a sad case that 
nowadays one has to worry not only whether it will actually be a proper games 
console but also whether the bloody thing will blow up as pretty much all my 
360's did!</p> </li> </ol>
