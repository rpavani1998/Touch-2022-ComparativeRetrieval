<p>By Andy Robinson for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Gamers are still happy with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and EA would like to 
see the current generation of consoles last &quot;a little longer&quot;.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 That's according to EA Labels boss Frank Gibeau, who in an 
interview with CVG questioned what Sony and Microsoft could be able to do with 
'next-gen' hardware over current consoles.
<p></p> 
<p>Pointing to the publisher's stunning FPS contender Battlefield 3, the exec 
argued there's still horsepower left to squeeze out of PS3 and Xbox 360.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's hard for me to conceive what you would do on a PlayStation 
4,&quot; Gibeau said. &quot;The displays are already 1080p, you're already 
connected to the internet... You could make it faster, you could have more 
polys and you could up the graphics a little bit... but at what cost?</p> 
<p>&quot;It'll be interesting to see how [Sony and Microsoft] think about it 
in terms of the next generation but it seems to me that customers are happy, 
and we're happy to build games on [360 and PS3] right now.&quot;</p> 
<p>He added: &quot;The way the business used to run where you had these big 
console transitions just isn't happening anymore. They're much longer, the 
online capabilities are making the way customers interact within the audience 
very different from when we went from PSOne to PS2.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think that [the age of] big, abrupt change in consoles where we all 
pile in on top of each other and everything changes overnight is just 
gone.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 The exec, who showcased an impressive line-up including Mass 
Effect 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic and Battlefield 3 at Gamescom this month, 
claimed EA's happy with the &quot;consistent&quot; technology of current 
consoles.
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;One of the things that we like is that the technology is consistent, 
and we believe that there are still things that you can do on these systems... 
we haven't quite squeezed the last once of hardware horsepower out of these 
things, as you can see with Battlefield 3.</p> 
<p>&quot;Frostbite 2 technology coming in can do some really interesting 
things that nobody is able to do, and you see some great stuff coming from our 
competitors too.&quot;</p> 
<p>He added: &quot;I'd like to see the cycle last a little longer. I don't see 
consumers right now banging on the walls for a new platform. They seem to be 
very happy with their PS3s and 360s. They love the online connectivity, they 
have great communities and great libraries.</p> 
<p>&quot;I like the fact that Nintendo's coming in with new hardware. That'll 
help really rev up their business for the HD side, which is where we're in a 
really good position.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the same interview, the EA Labels president told CVG the publisher is 
looking to re-imagine and bring back &quot;a couple&quot; of classic franchises.

<p>In a way he's right.... other than the fact that nearly no ps3 games and 
blurays achieve full 1080p, even simple arade games are mostly 720 upscaled.<br>
And the other point that devs spend most of their time, money and brain power 
on squeezing the ps3 rather than putting the expenses into the game content and 
ideas becuase the consoles have terribly small abouts of ram.</p>
<p>I guess one thing this gen has done, it has meant that devs have put 
serious amount of time into making our editors/engines and work pipelines much 
more accessible... if you have the money to go that route.</p>
<p>New consoles please.</p> </li>

<p>That article irritated me beyond belief.<br>
Current gen graphics are 
stale. He uses BF3 as an example of console graphics moving forward but its a 
pale showing compared to the pc version. And where did this guy get the idea 
consoles output 1080p??? On 360, game are UPSCALED to 1080p and most modern 
games are sub 720p native nowadays - on PS3 they don't ever bother to upscale 
to 1080p on 99/100 games.<br>
Another reason to update hardware, if you're 
Sony, is 3d. They're pushing it down our throats but on ps3 the tech just aint 
there to do it any justice.<br>
I think this guy stands alone. Ubi want new 
consoles, so do epic and id and others.<br>
I was thinking about Assassins 
creed the other day, and why we're getting Ezio ACII clones now every year, I 
think its clear there hanging on for next gen b4 we see ACIII.</p> </li>

<p>Surely the next gen must come with like 1TB hard drives or some cloud based 
system where you can download stream games. They would also need to keep 
physical media present. I just hope all the games are not in 3D or motion 
controller based either.</p> </li>

<p>I 100% agree with this, I don't think now's the time for new consoles. I'm 
not willing to spend lots of money on consoles that are really not going to be 
a massive leap in graphics or any different control schemes or anything. I 
think that the next generation will be the last generation really, since I 
think we must soon come to a point when it's not actually possible to make 
better graphics. The only thing that makes the argument at all for me for the 
next gen is to make all games at 60fps at 1080p as some have said.</p> </li>

<p>I think he's saying that new machines would <i>only</i> make games look 
nicer. And that the leap isn't going to be earth shattering as has been the 
case before. All the gimmicks with internet, motion control etc are now in 
place. All that's left to do is beef up the machines. I know for a fact that 
those of you who clamour for bigger, faster machines will be the most 
disappointed when they come because all you're going to see are games that are 
exactly the same just nicer looking. And if all you really wanted were snazzier 
graphics every once in a while you'd have a PC.</p>
<p>Having said that, I suspect that what you really want is a kind of blurring 
between the capabilities of PC and HC. You want the improvement in hardware 
that comes with time (and who wouldn't?) but you don't really want to have to 
pay through the nose for a new machine. Now, I know nothing about PC gaming and 
the need to buy graffx c4rds every other 'timeperiod' but I do know that that 
is also part of the reason we play HCs-we don't want to have to upgrade the 
machine ourselves. But when each 5-7 year time frame generates a smaller and 
smaller improvement the logical steps are either to just get out and find a new 
hobby OR to accept that more and more time must elapse between each generation.
</p>
<p>Cinema goers and people who read a lot of books have been consuming exaclty 
the same type of thing for decades or even centuries for books but videogames 
have evolved blindingly fast in comparison. Cinema evolved from still images to 
moving ones before the addition of sound all within 2-3 decades but many many 
decades later 3D came along. Books have been the same for thousands of years 
with (I suppose) only the Kindle now revolutionising the art of reading-Ia 
hobby once conducted at home or in a library is not limited by anything at all 
now. I suspect that although there are advances to be made that will 
fundamentally change videogames (like mind control and all that jazz) they are 
few and far between and more time will be required to get them off the ground.
</p>
<p>So, to sum up: videogames of the next 5-10 years are going to look, feel 
and play pretty much the same way and with graffx alone being insufficient 
reason to buy a new machine at the 5 year juncture we are going to have to get 
used to 10, 15 or 20 year gaps. Tha is if the HC even survives in its current 
state which is probably unlikely in itself. But that is the subject for another 
lecture.</p> </li>

<p>Nope, we simply do not need new consoles. Said this repeatedly in every 
pointless article about new consoles. Leave it longer until you even consider 
bringing out a PS4. BF3 may look better on PC but it certainly isn't to the 
point everyone is weeping for the console versions looking so poor. It just 
looks sharper in a few areas and a few better textures. Nothing that's going to 
stop a person having a riot on the game. Do you see people who enjoy console 
games bitching about these &quot;bland&quot; graphics, when we're seeing 
graphically beautiful games such as Uncharted? No, you don't. Do you see people 
complaining about Deus Ex's art style even though it's not got the greatest 
textures on any platform? No, you don't. Do you see people demanding new 
hardware and consoles not because of what the possibility of new tech could do 
for storytelling and new and original gameplay mechanics, but all because the 
graphics aren't looking &quot;all that&quot;? Yes, you do. That there is the 
problem.</p>
<p>When a developer is bringing something as beautiful in artstyle, audio, 
story and gameplay like Deus Ex, and something as fun yet simple and gorgeous 
to look at like the Uncharted series or Gears of War, it's safe to say in my 
opinion that any mention of new consoles is simply unneeded. As disappointing 
as this generation has been (with the exception of me being extremely happy 
about DEHR), I've no interest in even considering getting involved with new 
consoles., especially when the only thing they'll bring to the table is 
slightly better looking games that are the same old corridor and online 
shooters. Sorry but the difference in quality between PC and console right 
now.. is simply not big enough to impress me. Nothing some PC developer or 
elitist obsessed with poly counts and pointless tesselation and underwhelming 
directx11 upgrades, will change my mind. I have yet to see anything from any 
unoriginal tech demo for the &quot;future&quot; that impresses me. Same old 
s**t each generation. Promises and hopes, underwhelming results.</p>
<p>I'll stick with my consoles and current PC thank you very much.</p> </li>

<p>I would hope the next generation of machines would have power to spare, so 
instead of having to comb through code making tiny optimisations everywhere, 
game developers could just get on with making games (that runs happily at 1080p 
and 60fps). Things like a PhysX chip to handle physics; a DSP dedicated to AI 
and higher functions; a top of the range GPU; a s**tload of RAM so programmers 
don't have to page stuff or use clever streaming tricks... Talk to the 
developers and find out what they want - give them the power they need (within 
reason) and hopefully that can spend less effort coding bespoke engines and 
more time making games in a shorter time frame.</p>
<p>For me, if you just took most of the AAA games and made them 1080p/60 (with 
enough room that they didn't have to skimp on textures), I'd be pretty happy.
</p>
<p>EDIT: And no I don't want a f**king great expensive PC cluttering up my 
lounge, thanks.</p> </li>

<p>How about a console that doesn't keep crashing when I'm using PlayTV or the 
internet browser?</p>
<p>I had no problems at all with my original 'fat' 60gb PS3 (that is until the 
YLOD). The slim seems a far inferior version of the same product. Have loads of 
little hassles with it (just enough to niggle) but apparently nothing wrong 
with it?</p>

<p>I don't think this guy really knows what he's talking about to be honest...
</p>
<p>Ever heard of Moore's law? Computer power doubles every 2 years which means 
that after 6 years now, we could have consoles<b>at least</b> 8 times (1x2x2x2) 
more powerful than the 360 and ps3!</p>
<p>The graphics and overall power on today's consoles ARE looking very dated 
now and people are noticing more and more. That being both dev's and the 
consumer's.</p>
<p>The day's of huge leaps have gone? I don't think so... The biggest reason 
people get so shocked and amazed by new technology is because they think that 
we're already at the pinnacle of our technical prowess. That's just ridiculous!

<p>You know, the argument I always see from people is about about the eye 
candy and that is the problem. New hardware is needed, but its not for the sake 
of graphics. What is needed is more cpu power and ram, forget the graphics and 
focus on what would make for better games. He talks up BF3 as some showcase of 
what they are able to achieve but doesn't mention the fact that it had to be 
scaled back in order to get it to work on a console. Some of the developers 
have said this about next-gen, some go on about graphics. A game doesn't have 
to have the best graphics in the world to be a great game.</p>
<p>Imagine (insert your favorite game here) would be like with better AI, 
greater interaction with the environment, smoother frame rates, greater physics 
and all the things that could suck you even more into the world the game is 
trying to portray.</p>
<p>PC gamers always say &quot;haha get a PC and you will have those great 
graphics&quot;. The problem being is that PC games may have the better 
graphics, some times, but aren't getting a better game. PC gaming has been held 
back by the console market for a decade. If they make a game that took complete 
advantage of the power that it has, and then tried to release a neutered 
version to the console market, the console players would bitch and moan like 
crazy.</p>
<p>Bring on a new console, load that sucker up with tons of ram and a top end 
cpu. Top it off with a great video card and a sizable hard drive and let the 
developers go to town on it. Then developers can't bitch and moan themselves 
for releasing the same game over and over again without any real advancement in 
gameplay because of the hardware specs. A console like that would last a long 
time and go a long way to holding off the eventual transition to services like 
Onlive for a few more years.</p> </li>

<p>But that's exactly the point. That's all you're going to get. A football 
bouncing a bit more nicely or facial expressions just a little bit less stupid. 
Fair enough much much larger games can be produced with better hardware and 
stuff like improved AI make for better experiences but the problem with that 
argument is that (a) they can still be realised the better skilled a developer 
is and (b) I do NOT want to pay for a new machine so soon if that's all i'm

<p>Your kidding me right, your using a sports game as your example? A genre 
that really wouldn't see any jump in gameplay no matter what the hardware is? 
As to your &quot;a&quot;, no it can't without sacrificing in other areas. 
Developers are saying that they can't get anymore out of it in those areas 
because of the limitations that are there. But according to you, they just 
aren't skilled enough to accomplish it. And your &quot;b&quot; comment, sums up 
your argument, you don't want to pay. Just because you can't see what the 
improvements would be, doesn't mean that there wouldn't be a lot. Better AI 
means the CPU team comes at you in different ways than just scripted reactions.

<p>The improvements are not going to overly effect multiplayer at the start, 
but the single player game could be so more immersive than what is even capable 
today. I enjoy multiplayer just as much as the next gamer, but a really good 
single player game that you can get lost in is where it would be. Today's games 
just don't do that.</p> </li>

Im in the process of building with an phenom 2 x4 980 3.4ghz,4-6 gb 
ram,as for this console gen is dragging and although ps3 is great it didernt 
have a great start and it as lacked in software also with 360 getting old ms is 
always snapping at the heals of ninty and sony and sony cannot afford to lag 
behind next gen.<br>
improvements could be better online connection 100-200GB 
bluray discs,faster cpu,loads of ram and a wooping great big gpu.</p> </li>

<p>I feel the new generation is needed, alot of games are just packed with 
jaggies and lag spikes and below 1080p 99% of the time, the ps4 isn't just 
going to bring more power, its going to bring new features just like the ps3 
did, i mean look what they did with their portable playstation, its got tons of 
features and it looks as good as a ps3 or atleast good enough to look like one 
on a handheld screen, if they can innovate new technology for their handheld 
then imagine what they are doing with the ps4 right now, i also agree with the 
pc comments, hell my one was cheaper to build than what i paid for my ps3 and 
everygame has atleast &pound;10 off on release, along with mod support on alot 
of games and free online gaming and the moment new games start to run bad all i 
need to do is invest &pound;74 on another one of my graphics cards (XFX 1gb 
5770) run it on crossfire and i'll be back to 60fps on everything, my xbox 360 
was more expensive to buy, maintain and build a library of games for it than my 
pc is, you can even catch dlc cheaper on steam along with games and it looks 
way better than the old 360 and ps3 and i've saved about &pound;250 on just 
games alone, nevermind dlc and xbox live etc, more and more of my freinds are 
going to pc gaming for the first time in their life, they all had either 360's 
and ps3's so that must be a sign for change, i was afraid of big pc prices and 
building it, but with a little help online and from a mate who's also into pc 
gaming it was a piece of cake and it was fun building the damn thing, you just 
got to do a little research about it, but i'm sure once the ps4 comes along or 
a new xbox i'll jump right back to the consoles, for now though i'm just 
playing MK9 on ps3 until the pc version comes out!</p> </li>

<p>Erm... he's right! The next gen has been here for years, its called the PC, 
mad cos u ain't got one?</p>
<p>Just to let you know bud, (and im being serious this time) my PC actually 
is as powerful as getting punched in the face by Mike Tyson in his heyday.<br>

Its a i7 quad core matched with a s**t hot chunk of Nvidea goodness, but i 
don't really play games on it , apart from Sanctum (which is excellent and 
you'll find on steam) .<br>
I purchased my PC for Video editing, music writing 
and graphics work, and i think that spending the sort of money on it for that 
purpose warrants it, however i am less convinced that buying a pc for games for 
the same sort of wedge is a sensible move, not that you wouldn't get superior 
graphics in many cases , it just doesn't seem sensible (or mature in a way).<br>
I know exactly what i want in my next console and what i want it to do, and to 
have it at a price point that consumers will buy means it is at least two years 
away at the earliest.<br>
As console (and increasingly mobile platform) 
development actually leads games development now, your not going to see any 
huge advances/steps in the PC world of gaming either in regards to ray-tracing 
etc.<br>
The next bunch of next gen consoles will be fairly exotic inside and 
at that point will probably make gaming Desktop PC fairly redundant, so enjoy 
it while you can as im afraid to say that within 5 years , its dodo time.</p>

sell at a low competitive price, when you can have Onlive and still have the

with software built into the sdk to cheapen dev cycles and allow smaller

<p>Sort of funny how most people know this except the Boss and maybe CVG for

<p>Any way i fully agree that the resolution (GPU + CPU perhaps) + RAM size is 
the only areas it could be improved.<br>
But seriously even from 8bit consoles 
up to now not much has changed really! Sure people are or rather can be 
connected but many people like myself (and friends) just hook up their console 
for some quality gaming time alone or maybe with their kids. I dont need the 
console to grow a tail or horn to just for being different! For me it is enough 
it gets updated with better hardware to keep up with the graphic and offer 
developers more capability to do better games rather then optimizing all the 
time.<br>
People today have to strange expectations i think. I rather have a 
PS4 with kick ass GPU+CPU+RAM then a Wii U with a lousy touchpad as controller 
any day. Just my opinion.</p> </li>

Agree totally (without the dickwad bit, was that becessary eh?). EA 
man wants the resources they have invested in this gen (which is the most 
expensive to develop ever for a number of reasons ) to last a bit longer. 
Carmack has rattled on about how all the assets everyone has will be re-used on 
the next-gen as it has cost too much in time and money to develop games 
recently, so we are really deluding ourselves if we think a quantum leap in 
tech is gonna happen.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no probs this gen lasting two more years. Looking at 
Skyrim, Rage etc (360 owner but really looking forward to some PS3 exclusives 
in the pipe-line) I can happily live with the current gaming fidelity. I do 
think that the PC should be viewed as &quot;space exploraion&quot; and all the 
new grapical techniques should be road-tested there before being shifted to the 
next-gen consoles. PC gamers can afford it. Everyone wins.</p> </li>

<p>^^^^^ This ^^^^^</p>
<p>While I am happy to pay the price of a new console, in real terms cheaper 
than they have been in previous generations, there are some who complain about 
the cost and some who don't mind paying the premium for a PC big rig or an 
Apple i'product'.</p>
<p>While I like my PC, I don't want to sit at a desk and play games, neither 
do I want to clutter up my living room TV unit with a PC, my console looks good 
and fits perfectly into my TV unit and is perfect for just casually picking it 
up to enjoy some great media or gaming titles that even my computer phobic wife 
is happy to pick up and turn on.</p>
<p>Moore's law is not going to exponentially improve facial animations each 
year, infact Nvidia actually stated that &quot;Moore's Law CPU scaling &#147;is 
now dead&#148; claims NVIDIA&quot;, they are now working on heat and cost 
efficiency brought with the advances rather than speed, (we've been at around 
~3GHz for a while now), a lot of the detail in graphics is down to programming, 
budgets and trying to get a profit out of spending time and effort into a title 
in the first place, and taking a look at Uncharted, LA Noire, Deus Ex, Daemon's 
Souls or whatever floats your boat just shows that consoles can output stuff 
that is quite stunning to look at on the largest of TV's.</p>
<p>I would be quite happy to see the new consoles come out tomorrow, but only 
if the consoles and games warranted it and brought something new to the table. 
Consoles can never be future proofed to everyone's liking, sticking a shed load 
of RAM and CPU power into it on release is just going to make it expensive and 
unprofitable, Microsoft and Sony have struggled with that, only recently 
becoming profitable on hardware sales. Nintendo really didn't make a hardware 
advance gamble on the Wii, the hardware was not revolutionary and was therefore 
cheap, looking at the Wii U it doesn't look like a hardware advance either that 
will be at the forefront of graphics for years to come.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued to see the next generation, I would welcome it warmly, I just 
don't want it to be released prematurely with less functionality, less advance 
in visuals et al and higher cost because of it.</p> </li>

<p>I won't be jumping from my ps3 anytime soon - so the next gen can wait.</p>

<p>That article irritated me beyond belief.<br>
Current gen graphics are 
stale. He uses BF3 as an example of console graphics moving forward but its a 
pale showing compared to the pc version. And where did this guy get the idea 
consoles output 1080p??? On 360, game are UPSCALED to 1080p and most modern 
games are sub 720p native nowadays - on PS3 they don't ever bother to upscale 
to 1080p on 99/100 games.<br>
Another reason to update hardware, if you're 
Sony, is 3d. They're pushing it down our throats but on ps3 the tech just aint 
there to do it any justice.<br>
I think this guy stands alone. Ubi want new 
consoles, so do epic and id and others.<br>
I was thinking about Assassins 
creed the other day, and why we're getting Ezio ACII clones now every year, I 
think its clear there hanging on for next gen b4 we see ACIII.</p> </blockquote>
<p>3D is a fad so don't bother and after 30 minutes with a game anyone with an 
IQ higher than 80 is used to the &quot;improved&quot; graphics.</p> </li>

<p>To me this just sounds like EA wants to be lazy. Making games for new 
systems means EA would have to spend some money. They want to stay with current 
consoles because it's a safe bet. They can keep pumping out BF 15 and Madden 89 
without having to spend anything. Don't they see it? People are talking about 
PC again because the consoles are so freaking outdated. PS3 can't even do cross 
game chat and has less than 512mb of RAM. Don't get me started on the 360's 
dirt old DVD. If EA wants to stick with the 360 and PS3... oh well, f**k em. 
I'll just have to make do without EA when the 720 and PS4 come out. That wont 
be too hard </p>

<p>Whatever, everybody's entitled to their opinion, but EA is just saying this 
because it's better for their bottom line. Anyone saying that they are experts 
and they know better is a tool.</p> </li>

<p>What would the PS3 even do?</p>
<p>Well, for starters I&#145;m confident that it&#145;ll achieve something 
which the 360 has repeatedly failed at which is basic functionality... </p>
