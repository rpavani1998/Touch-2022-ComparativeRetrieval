<p>By Andy Robinson for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>The next Xbox's rumoured move to block used games would be &quot;a 
fantastic change for our business,&quot; says Volition designer Jameson Durall.
</p> 
<p>Writing via the AltDevBlog, the Red Faction: Armageddon man claims the 
general public don't appreciate how much pre-owned game sales are hurting 
developers, and welcomesrumours that the Xbox 720 could introduce a 
platform-wide online pass system - throttling the pre-owned market.</p> 
<p>  &quot;There's another big rumor about the next Xbox console that could 
really start to shake things up... it won't play used games at all,&quot; 
Durall writes.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 &quot;Personally I think this would be a fantastic change for 
our business and even though the consumers would be up in arms about it at 
first... they will grow to understand why and that it won't kill them.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p>He adds: &quot;The system is already there for Microsoft, all they'd have 
to do is use the DLC and codes model they have to tie a game to your Xbox live 
account.</p> 
<p>&quot;Each retail disc would likely need that unique key somewhere in the 
code so the account would be able to link it properly. Ideally it would tie a 
full version to the console it is registered on so family members can play even 
if the main account isn't signed in, but this is exactly how their model works 
now anyway.&quot;</p> 
<p>The designer admits the proposed system would have faults, but goes on to 
suggest issues such as game rental and lending games to friends could be ironed 
out by Microsoft.</p> 
<p>&quot;I could see Microsoft implementing their own rental service which 
would maybe give them a code that activates the game for X days and they are 
charged a small amount,&quot; he says.</p> 
<p>&quot;This could work when you borrow the disc from someone or even with 
digital download of the full version. It would also send a percentage of the 
rental to the Developer with each rental... likely improving the overall 
revenue we would receive from it.&quot;</p> <br>

<p>He concludes: &quot;In the end, I fully believe that we have to do 
something about these issues or our industry is going to fall apart.</p> 
<p>&quot;People often don't understand the cost that goes into creating these 
huge experiences that we put on the shelves for only $60. They also don't seem 
to realize how much they are hurting us when they buy a used game and how 
pirating a copy is just plain stealing.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I know that some will say I'm not considering the retail games stores 
and the impact something like this would have on them...but remember they were 
doing fine well before the Used Games market became such a staple of their 
business.</p> 
<p>  The truth is, they aren't concerned with how this business is affecting 
us so why should I care how these changes will affect them?&quot;</p> 
<p>Last week THQ CEO Brian Farrell said the seemingly inevitable wave of new 
consoles represent a &quot;tremendous opportunity&quot; for the publisher.</p>

people that need to buy 2nd hand still get their games.....simple really. </p>

<p>If I can only buy a brand new game without being able to rent or buy used 
then I will just save my money for the best and will wait until all bugs and 
glitches have been identified before even considering buying (yes Skyrim, hang 
your head in laggy shame).</p>
<p> If they expect to continue providing the same poor service - rushed games, 
poor game testing, DLC which should have been included on release saved just to 
make more money etc. then I'm more than happy to wait until the inevitable 
price drops of both the new consoles and the games.</p> </li>

<p>So basically, we pay through the nose for software we can only use on one 
system? No sell-on value at all?</p>
<p>Hopefully this loon will have to eat his words. I know that I will buy a 
system that doesn't enforce this over one that does. I have pretty much 
boycotted EA because of their idiotic EA pass system.</p>
<p>Maybe if developers/publishers lowered the cost of their games, people 
would always buy new - but it's a risky business this gen, what with broken 
games being shipped to meet deadlines and please stockholders, why should we 
take the risk buying new if we aren't sure of the quality?</p> </li>

<p>If anything, this would probably actually lead to LESS sales for them.</p>
<p>People aren't going to want to pay to borrow a game from a friend to try 
it. If Microsoft did a rental service it would most likely be overpriced. If 
people can't trade in old games to fund new ones, people aren't going to be so 
willing to drop forty quid on your games.</p>
<p>Personally, I rarely ever buy used. The majority of my games I bought new, 
but this pre-owned games block would just be ridiculous.</p> </li>

<p>More like Microsoft will be ironed out. If this ever comes to fruition, I 
will not be purchasing it, or any console that follows suit.<br>

<p>It's within THQ's power to put it's money where it's mouth is, isn't it?</p>
<p>Release a game and have it not work at all unless you put in the one use 
code in the box. See what the response is, check out various branches of Game, 
Cex etc and see how many copies are on the shelves.</p>
<p>I rarely buy used, but I do trade some older games, but I boycotted Arkham 
because of the code, and I think the EA pass takes the p**s on the games they 
release annually, like FIFA.</p> </li>

<p>if they want me to purchase games at &pound;50 retail price then I expect 
the game to be of exceptional quality with plenty of replay value. No longer am 
I paying full price for a s**tty poor quality game cause I have been burnt many 
times before and never again.<br>
Consistency is the key. If the game isn't 
quality consistent through-out ie a tiniest slightest annoying section of any 
game then I'm not buying it. It has to be spot on 1000%. I expect nothing less. 
Otherwise they can f**k of and not take my good earned money.</p> </li>

<p>I agree with this guy, especially that last bit aimed at retailers. Whilst 
I'm unlikely to be negatively impacted by such a system (don't buy used/rarely 
borrow), if Microsoft were to go ahead and do it with the features he's 
described, it could work out.</p> </li>

<p>Sony and Ninty must be rubbing their hand together in anticipation of MS 
going through with this.<br>
Normally to take the position of market leader you 
have to do something special to win the cusumer. Rarely doe the current market 
leader simply jump on its own sword like this.</p>
<p>If this makes it to xbox at all - I give it 3-4 months max b4 MS pulls the 
plug and strips it out of the console.</p> </li>

<h6>slick loose on 6 Feb '12 said:</h6> 
<p>I love how they seem to think that everyone who buys second hand will now 
buy brand new games. People buy second hand games because they refuse to spend 
&pound;40 on something they will be done with, within a week.</p>
<p>If retailers are unwilling to drop the prices (which to be fair, they have 
been doing) all that is going to happen is that customers get alienated. For 
instance, if the 720 is Digital Distribution only and the games are still 
&pound;40...people will simply not buy them. It may even encourage people to 
turn to piracy or even worse, off gaming all together.</p>
<p>I'm not saying pre-owned gaming isn't hurting the industry but to just to 
completely obliterate it could be even worse.</p> </li>

<p>I won't be buying the Nextbox then, &pound;40+ quid for a game that lasts

<p>This won't only affect people buying used, what about the people who trade 
them against other purchases, because they don't have the money/space to keep 
all these games.</p>

<p>He makes a compelling argument. No one really seem to be concerned with his 
side of the industry. Which is odd because developers are what's most 
important. I can't say i like the idea of such a convoluted system and cd keys 
annoy me, but i see where he's coming from. I still think more emphasis on 
digital download and some better business models from publishers could do 
wonders for some cases. There has to be other, less cumbersome options but to 
be fair why should a developer be concerned with the convenience of gamers or 
the revenue of retailers?</p>

I doubt it's that easy. If it was as easy as calling gamestop and 
asking them i think it would be done already. The retailers dont really have 
much incentive to cut the publisher/developer in unless the publisher's do 
things to change the status quo.</p> </li>

<p>I really can't see this happening. The answer to pre-owned is cheaper 
digital distribution. Faced with the option of buying a new Xbox with no 
pre-owned or a PS4 with pre-owned MS would lose millions of sales! I'm a 
die-hard Xbox fan - haven't touched Sony since the PS1. But I would seriously 
consider switching if this became a reality.</p> </li>

<p>It's this kind of attitude that has got THQ into so much financial trouble; 
they have a complete inability to see the bigger picture or to think outside of 
the box.</p>
<p>As an example; Johnny Customer has &pound;100 to spend on games. He buys a 
new copy of Call of Duty for &pound;50, then he buys three pre-owned games with 
the remaining &pound;50, one of which is your THQ game.</p>
<p>Johnny Customer has now played your game. If he likes it, he may buy 
another of your games, or pay you &pound;10 for an online pass to play the 
multi-player portion of your game.</p>
<p>He probably won't though, because your games are usually rubbish.</p>

<p>All purchases I make I keep in mind the resale value. And most purchases I 
make I only make because they are cheap as preowned games. It would hurt devs 
to take away preowned as they probably wouldn't get the sale from people 
relying on preowned to get money back, and definately wouldn't get the exposure 
from the preowned browser with only a few quid in their pocket. Maybe I'm a 
cheap bastard or maybe devs think they are the only ones without unlimited 
money.</p> </li>

<p>Im not particularly bothered about pre-owned games as I dont buy them but 
not being able to sell games on or trade them with friends will only damage the 
industry, people will only buy the games they know they will like. What happens 
with refunds too? If its implemented, the backlash would be monumental, smaller 
developers would go under and the number of new IP's would drop off a cliff. 
Companies are scared to back them now, whats gonna happen when people refuse to 
buy games because they cant return/trade/swap them. This fella needs a smack 
round the head for this rubbish.</p> </li>

<p>Maybe the devs at THQ should first worry about making a game actually worth 
paying full price for at launch. I have yet to actually buy a THQ title at 
launch or even new for that matter simply because they typically take little 
time to play (Homefront &amp; Red Faction Armageddon were one-sitting beats).

<h6>WHERESMYMONKEY on 6 Feb '12 said:</h6> 
<p>well its all bacoming clear as to why THQ are losing money now. This would 
be disasterous for the industry. the sooner people come to realise that lending 
things to people and word of mouth are the most powerful marketing tools they 
have the beter.</p>
<p>There's a reason that sequels sell more than the first iterations in 
series. Its because people lend them to others after they've finished them and 
then they go. well that was great nad buy the sequel and so on and so faorth.
</p>
<p>I understand that used sales don't get any money back to the publishers. 
therefore the devs suffer because of poor numbers.</p>
<p>But in order for this system to become even vaguely feasable and for 
consumers and retailers to not simply ignore or actively boycott both the 
hardware and software is to drmatically and i mean cut by at least half the 
price of games for it. Especially from suppliers to retail chains. At present 
new software has a market of literally a couple of quid for retailers so it is 
no surprise that they heavily back trading in and used sales as there is no 
money in selling new games. Make it worth retails while and they'll back it.</p>
<p>So far it seems the console that begins to abandon these draconion and 
needless to say desperate attempts at controlling what we as users can and 
can't do with our own purchases will be the winners of the nest gen.</p> </li>

<h6>MJ-Thriller94 on 6 Feb '12 said:</h6> 
<p>Now, i would agree with this guy completely, if games were &pound;20-25. 
The fact that games are being priced at &pound;40-50, and that they are being 
released full of bugs (Skyrim), parts cut out of them (a-la Deus Ex), or games 
that last a few hours (too many to mention) makes this guys argument 
non-existent. Like many have already said here, people buy games pre-owned 
because they don't wish to pay such high prices. If they want to kill the 
pre-owned market, then the industry must cut the prices of its games.</p>
<p>I myself buy games pre-owned, alot. I only ever buy games brand new if it 
is something that suits my taste or is part if a series that i love (Metal Gear 
Solid to mention one). Only then am i willing to pay said prices for such 
games. The Online Pass system i can understand, and to an extent it works. The 
only reason i think people are so against it is simply because the prices of 
games are too high.</p>
<p>The industry wants to sort out the pre-owned problem. Well if they sort out 
their pricing down to a respectable &pound;20-25, along with online passes, 
then BANG! PROBLEM SOLVED!</p> </li>

<p>I agree that it definitely won't kill them but asking for them to

<p>If this ever happened, two things would happen.</p>
<p>1. Big franchises go unaffected: FIFA/CoD/Halo/Gears/BF/Uncharted would 
still sell at current prices.</p>
<p>2. Everyone else will have no choice but to release games at lower prices
</p>
<p>Majority of people these days stick to their comfort blanket games (see 
above list) as they know what they're getting with them, people deem original 
games (Shadows of the Damned) a risk at 40 quid but would give a try at 15-20 
quid, the second hand market gives us the opportunity to alleviate that risk 
with for ex. Shadows of the Damned by trading games against it, without the 
second hand market to lessen the risk, games like Shadows of the Damned would 
have no choice to be released at a lower price.</p>
<p>That is if the publisher has brains.</p> </li>

<p>Blocking 2nd hand games isnt the way to fixing the second-hand industry, 
partially ruining the games industry.<br>
The way to fix it is to make online 
passes for every single secondhand game that exists, and if that user wants to 
play it online (or even have achievements tracked) then you need to buy an 
online pass for it.</p>
<p>If every publisher and every developer got behind Online Pass systems, 2nd 
hand gaming wouldnt be an issue.</p> </li>

complain about, they would have no option to buy at a higher price, otherwise 
NO profit at all. after all, it is the retailers who are shafting publishers 
supposedly.</p>
<p>big stores like GAME, stores known to profit from second-hand sales could 
have their prices bumped up accordingly.</p> </li>

<p>the sooner this company completes its rapid decent to bankruptcy the better.
</p>
<p>locking out LEGAL preowned games would not only most likely lead to several 
lawsuits but if it succeeded would pretty much guarantee a last place / exit 
from the videogame market for whichever maker allowed this on their system, i 
mean just what kind of moron would by a system that couldnt play borrowed, 
rented or purchased pre owned titles.</p>
<p>the only way i'd buy console that locked out used games was if it was 
hacked to within an inch of its life so i didnt have to buy ANY games for it 
and i wouldnt feel any guilt at all for pirating anything produced for it that 
used the feature.</p>
<p><br>
this is like taking that evil online pass system one stage further and 
is the kind of thing the greedy scum who use them and the braindead morons who 
believe their bulls*it and support it would love, whilst at the same time do 
they really care if it destroys the entire industry they will kill with their 
short term greed?</p> </li>

<p>Blocking second hand games would be a stupid move, let me just say that up 
front.<br>
<i>But</i> I can see their point. The problem isn't people putting 
their games up on ebay or craigslist, the problem is game stores actively 
pushing used over new, converting<i>guaranteed</i> new sales into used sales at 
the counter. I've seen it a million times with my own eyes. There hasn't been a 
single time that I've been to buy a new copy of a title a few weeks or more old 
from Gamestop/EB where I haven't been offered a 'pre-owned' version instead at 
the counter... &quot;You'll save five bucks&quot;. Now I don't buy used unless 
I have no other choice - I'd rather pay five more bucks and have some of my 
money go to the people that actually made the game I want to play than<i>all</i>
 of the money going to people that have done f**k all and who are actively 
trying to bring down the industry they rely on - but I've seen people in front 
of me in the queue take them up on it.<br>
Now they were <i>guaranteed</i> new 
sales, they had the new copy in their hand and took it to the counter to buy 
it, they were 'converted' to the used copy by the staff at the counter, robbing 
the publisher of any return.</p>
<p>That's the sort of stuff that p**ses publishers off and that's the stuff 
that needs to be addressed, not punishing the customer.</p> </li>

<p>I hope Microsoft does it. I really, really do. It's about time gaming went 
back to being &pound;1.99 or &pound;2.99 for a budget game and &pound;7.99 or 
&pound;9.99 for a full priced game. Add these pre-owned / anti-piracy / 
no-rental game protection features and lets see a mammoth price drop for all 
games!</p>
<p>Eh? What do you mean - &quot;NO&quot;?</p>
<p>Oh you still expect punters to pay you &pound;50 every time you release a 
shameless rip-off annual repeat version of the same game? Oh so you say the 
game costs this much because of what it takes to make it and that it's nothing 
to do with losing money to pre-owned / piracy / rentals or general 
profiteering? Oh well in that case I don't believe you at all.</p>
<p>I'm down with the renaissance period, DIY indie coders for the win. There 
was a time when people who wrote games - wrote games and publishers like 
Imagine, Ocean and Gremlin were so slim they were based in cottages.</p>
<p>Corporate publishers are the BLOAT in the video game industry, just as per 
the equivalents in the music industry and er - maybe every industry! The reason 
companies like Tesco do so well is by sourcing directly and cutting out the 
middle man. The sooner coders out there go indie, team up and start releasing 
their own stuff - the better it'll be for those actually responsible for making 
the games and for gamers. The irony is that most people don't see the mess 
they're involved in, feeding the fat cats - they cling to their &quot;safe 
jobs, perks and pension schemes&quot; even when none of it is really 
&quot;safe&quot; at all.</p> </li>

How would small developers die and new ip's drop off a cliff when we

self publish or if they dont publisher's dont have to pay the cost of getting

enough New copies. New ip's are more likely to be bought used, wouldn't a 
publisher support more new ip's if all sales were new sales? That's not a very 
good argument. Your ignoring a problem that exists now for a problem that MIGHT

<p>There's a reason that sequels sell more than the first iterations in

new software has a market of literally a couple of quid for retailers so it is 
no surprise that they heavily back trading in and used sales as there is no 
money in selling new games. Make it worth retails while and they'll back it.</p>

quid, the second hand market gives us the opportunity to alleviate that risk

second hand market to lessen the risk, games like Shadows of the Damned would 
have no choice to be released at a lower price.</p>

No what's more likely in the case of shadows of the damned, is someone

<p><br>
Dlc is supposed to keep a game relevant. A lot of games with big 
marketing budgets are being released and games are easily forgotten so if you 
wait a few months people have already either forgotten about your game or 
traded it in. I dont think there's anything wrong with making content before 
release. I do think they should be priced correctly and developers should be 
wary of what they are leaving out. Not only that but just because something is 
made before launch date doesn't mean it could easily have been on the disc.<br>

As for the argument that SR3 is not worth the money, any idea how much SR2 cost 
to make in comparison to 3? I cant say if SR3 feels like it's lacking because i 
haven't played it and i cant say if that's just the way it is or if the game 
has an entire schedule of dlc already finished that will make it whole because 
i dont work for thq, but i do think the value of games has been distorted a 
little. Think about movies for a minute. For me movies cost $11 for probably 
around 2 hours of entertainment maybe less. I can watch that movie once. That's 
all. Games provide many more hours of entertainment, and you can replay it 
anytime you want. Not to mention it being an interactive experience. Developers 
aren't paid well and dont have great hours so to them gamers complaining about 
$60 for all of their work probably doesn't mean much. That being said i do 
think games should be priced better rather than setting 90% of retail games at 
$60.</p> </li>

<p>The main point that was highlighted to me was when he mentioned the rising 
development costs. People like him in the roles they currently hold have no 
interest in dev tools becoming streamlined and the games being made cheaper - 
it would adversely effect his job and those of his immediate superiors (never 
mind your run of the mill coder who is sleeping under his desk come 
&quot;crunch time&quot; - the burn out rate for those jobs is akin to London 
bus drivers. Soon as the finance sector becomes healthy again, you watch the 
number of programmers jump ship in the coming years). People in his position 
will pay lip service to Carmack who shout on and on about making games quicker 
and cheaper to make, but they really have no interest in changing the status 
quo.</p>
<p>This whole arguement about pre-owned gaming is as tired and predictable as 
that of religon vs atheism. The pro-pre-owned group will shout loudly that 
&quot;I can sell a car without giving Ford/VW etc. any money, so why can't I 
sell on my game? And the anti-preowned will argue that the comparison isn't 
valid as other industries, like cars and films, have had almost 100yrs to 
streamline their manufacturing process. I can see both sides of the arguement, 
although I will say that after 40yrs, the gaming industry is being forced to 
evolve, and the genius' that supply the market what it wants instead of 
enforcing its own vision will eventually win. Its found to its own great cost 
that it isn't as &quot;recession proof&quot; as it boldly claimed back in 2009 
and the pendulum is going to have to swing back at least a little in the 
consumers favour.</p>
<p>This digital lockdown on content is coming whether we like it or not. 
Glancing into my broken crystal ball, its just going to raise the prices of 
supposed &quot;AAA&quot; games as the dev costs are going to get even higher, 
and the consumer is going to be ever reluctant to spend. The downside might be 
a gaming world that is an even more extreme version of what we have now, with 
only Sports franchises and CODXXVIII/Mass Effect 25 being the order of the day. 
Even if we still own a piece of silicone under the TV, I can imagine cloud 
computing being used as a constant revenue stream that can also be used to kill 
piracy once and for all (To play COD 25, sign up for our cloud network for the 
extra processing power you need, just &pound;5.99 per month!).</p>
<p>Probably gonna get laughed off the forum, but future initiatives like Apple 
TV suddenly seem like an interesting alternative. Maybe getting too old to care 
about graphics (31, been here since the C64), but I am amazed at how quickly 
the Smartphone/Tablet market has come on. I'm not interested as yet, but I can 
see its potential. If they mimic the pricing and delivery structure of Apple, a 
small team of talented devs can do some surprising stuff. Yeah, theres alot of 
crap on the iphone/pad market, but also some stunning gems starting to come out 
too. If they are not careful, the classic &quot;AAA&quot; market is going to 
eat itself, just like the music biz.</p> </li>

<p>If pre-owned games were blocked it would certainly spell the end for 
specialist retail stores as they may have been able to get by before the 
establishment of the pre-owned market, but that was before the loss of sales 
through internet sites, as well as downloads, forced them to rely heavily on 
the sale of pre-owned games for profit. A much better solution would be to keep 
the pre-owned market but make retailers give a share of the profits to 
publishers. That might mean a slight rise in pre-owned prices, but it's better 
than abolishing them completely and it still means more money for publishers to 
invest in the production of more games.</p> </li>

<p>The full retail price is only an issue to people who HAVE to have the new 
thing straight away. I rarely pay more than &pound;20 for a game which I get 
from Amazon about 12 months after release.It saves having to keep waiting for 
patches to fix busted games on release too.</p>
<p>I've seen many comments stating how if Microsoft implemented this 
'solution' then everyone would buy the next playstation, but who is going to 
make the games? If the second hand game business is hurting them so much do 
they keep going until they go bankrupt? (Remember Team Bondii) How many studios 
have closed over the last 12 months? How many have lost their jobs?</p>
<p>There is the other solution of course. With games so expensive to make then 
they just jack up the 'new' price. Will you pay &pound;100 for the next Call of 
Duty? &pound;150? If not, how many people will pay that much so you can buy it 
2nd hand?</p>
<p>It's very easy for everyone to sit self righteously and say 'I don't like 
that', but are you going to like it any more when fewer and fewer games are 
released which are then mainly published by EA and Activision as the other 
publishers go out of business and then set their own prices as there will be 
very little competition?</p>
<p>Don't take these comments the wrong way. I personally believe the second 
hand market should remain. I just want to open your minds to a possible future 
instead of just jumping to the whole 'I have a keyboard and going to state my 
disgust' internet thing where people jump up and down without really seeing all 
the consequences.</p> </li>

<p>As someone stated on the comments, if everyone does second hand, many will 
loose their jobs, and to be honest I allways thought there's far too many games 
coming out. If they would concentrate in making good games instead of rushing 
them because of the competition and to make as much money as they can, then 
more people would buy them. If there's 1 good game per month, it would sell 
more than each of the 5-10 games. I would gladly pay 40pounds for a well worked 
game, no, uncharted 3 is far from it. I am saying something really big, 
perfectly crafted and with lots of replayability. The closest thing I've seen 
was Mario Galaxy 2 and Skyrim (but the bugs destroyed it). Games that give your 
moneys worth. I remember Metal Gear 4, with a little push it would have been a 
masterpiece and well worth 40pounds, the game was huge, full of possibilities 
but not as fun or memorable as the first metal gears, too many videos, no one 
buys a game to have to sit trough hours of videos, I'd rather read a good book 
with a really good story. Call of duty is the worst example of videogames, 40 
pounds for a game that you finish in 4 hours and is not really memorable or fun 
at all.</p>
<p>With all this said, I either buy them cheap second hand or pirate them, 
until they really start making good games.</p> </li>

Well i would think they wouldn't be launching at the same price if 
there was a one use code. And a digital version would have to cost even less 
than that. Now it's unlikely that the publishers would cut their prices, they 
want to have their cake and f**k it too, but this is all conjecture anyway. If 
the preowned market did not exist, shadows of the damned wouldn't be worse off, 
but that statement is operating on a lot of assumptions. There's no way of 
knowing how retailers would react or how publishers would behave. We can only 
guess.</p>
<p>If there was no used market retailers might have to drop prices on new 
games faster, so you cant really say shadows would be worse or better off.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>It's this kind of attitude that has got THQ into so much financial trouble; 
they have a complete inability to see the bigger picture or to think outside of 
the box.</p> 
<p>As an example; Johnny Customer has &pound;100 to spend on games. He buys a 
new copy of Call of Duty for &pound;50, then he buys three pre-owned games with 
the remaining &pound;50, one of which is your THQ game.</p> 
<p>Johnny Customer has now played your game. If he likes it, he may buy 
another of your games, or pay you &pound;10 for an online pass to play the 
multi-player portion of your game.</p> 
<p>He probably won't though, because your games are usually rubbish.</p> 
<p>THQ: Make Better Games.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
He's a designer not the publisher. He doesn't make those business 
decisions. And making &quot;better games&quot; is not a good argument. Good 
games sell badly, great games sell badly, sometimes bad games sell well, and 
alright games sell really well.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Making better games is absolutely the arguement here - along with pricing 
them accordingly. I traded in Homefront after finishing it in under five hours. 
I don't usually trade games in, but it was shorter than most XBLA games and I 
had paid &pound;45 for it and that annoyed me. It's this reason I haven't 
bought a THQ game since, as their standards of quality are generally lower than 
that of their competition.</p>
<p>If they take away the option of buying pre-owned without significantly 
adjusting their prices, even less people will be willing to take a chance on 
buying a brand new game from a publisher or a developer with a low-quality 
track-record, and the THQs of this world will just be crushed by the likes of 
EA and Activision.</p>
<p>It makes no difference if it&#146;s a developer saying it or a publisher 
&#150; getting rid of pre-owned will only ever work if they start pricing their 
content accordingly. THQ need to take a look at their business model (which to 
be fair to them, they are doing) before blaming all their woes on the pre-owned 
market.</p> </li>

<p>I only buy secondhand (&quot;preowned&quot; is just a word places like 
Blockbuster and Game made up to make it sound better) games if they are out of 
print and there is no possible other way to get them. However, this is 
completely against every consumer right in the book, not to mention morally 
wrong and for those reasons I will not be buying into this (I highly doubt its 
true anyway, I can't see something like this ever being given approval - its 
corporate suicide and very possibly illegal). Also, as I buy a lot of retro 
games what happens when the next xbox is old and there are some games I want to 
collect on it that I can't get new anymore? Stupid, brainless, nonsensical idea 
dreamed up by greedy over zealous corporations that are out of touch with 
reality.</p> </li>

<p>With out the ability to try a game beofre i buy it i wouldn't have half the 
games own now, all the games i bought i did buy new though after renting and 
trying them. Also what are we to do when the time comes that the games from 
this consel are old and not store avaliable any more? or they jusst stopped 
producing new coppies of the game (say like those of us who play origonal 
Xbox's SWTOR, not produced any more can only buy it used) honestly a majority 
of game circulation would down right stop, and in a state like mine where some 
of us, even the most hard core of gamers learn about an amazing game like Okami 
and want to buy it up years after it has stopped being produced (At least in my 
city a majority of us are trying to get that game and it doesn't exist except 
used any more due to age) So what are we to do? buy 2 or 3 coppies of every 
game and when time for them to become archaic comes sell them as new and 
unopened just so that the Dev can revel in their greed? ill gotten wishes for 
money due to greed annoys me, but killing basically an entire market just for 
one greedy lust of money, now theres one thing that can actually anger me to a 
point of actually boycotting</p> </li>
