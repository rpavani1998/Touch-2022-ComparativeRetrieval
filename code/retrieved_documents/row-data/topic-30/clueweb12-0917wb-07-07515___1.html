<p>The next generation Xbox will launch in 2013, according to a CNET source 
said to be working within Microsoft's Xbox team.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 Multiple sources also informed the tech site that there's a new 
face responsible for Xbox brand and design leadership as Microsoft moves 
towards launching Xbox 360's successor.
<p></p> 
<p>Don Coyner, who had guided that strategy since Xbox's inception over a 
decade ago, and most recently served as general manager of entertainment design 
at Microsoft, has reportedly taken on a different role at the company.</p> 
<p>Emma Williams, who led the launch of the new Xbox 360 dashboard as general 
manager of Xbox Experiences, has apparently assumed Coyner's former position.
</p> 
<p>Microsoft refused to comment on a potential Xbox 360 successor or personnel 
changes.</p> 
<p>The firm has long spoken of its ten-year plan for Xbox 360, which launched 
in late 2005, but that doesn't rule out a successor launching during the 
period, according to European Xbox boss Chris Lewis,who said in August:</p> 
<p>&quot;We think we're a little over halfway with the life cycle of the 
console, but that's not to say there won't be an overlap. I'm not going to 
announce specifically or talk about timing. But you could imagine there could 
be overlap, it depends. We're not being specific about the next generation at 
this stage.&quot;</p> 
<p>Microsoft is rumoured to be planning to make the first official 
announcements aboutXbox 720 at the CES expo in January 2012.</p> <br>

<p>Let's hope that this is true!! And let's hope Sony release PS4 in that year 
as well because even though this gen is amazing and we have amazing games to 
play, it's time to move forwards.</p>
<p> Both the Xbox and PS3 are flawed machines and are looking so ancient now. 
Let's hope ms make a proper machine this time like the awesome S model that 
should have been there from launch rather than the cheap piece of crap that was 
released in 2005 without any important basic features and one that was so cheap 
it had a spectacular failure rate that only the worst hardware companies could 
achieve.</p>
<p> As for Sony, let's get some basics this time like cross game chat and a 
better PSN service, charge for it if you must to make it better. Also make the 
system much easier to program for!! So we don't get s**tty ports again off the 
lazy developers. Let's have less of the bulls**t about how this machine is 
going to make me do 2 jobs to pay for it <br>
Also if you're going to make a 
beast of a machine then don't be retarded and skimp out on ram!!! That is the 
biggest flaw with the PS3 stopping it from being as awesome as it could have 
been.</p> </li>

<p>A 2013 release seems quite likely though I'm not sure we'll see the PS3's 
successor quite so soon. While I'm excited for the next generation I can't help 
but think we haven't experienced all this generation has to offer yet. I think 
it would be better to hold off the new consoles for another couple of years so 
the drastic hike in performance we've seen between the other generations can be 
just as apparent in the coming generation.</p> </li>

<p>So all eyes on MS at E3 2012 then.<br>
I think the 360 is maxed out now, 
although I think the PS3 still has room to grow, but I think 'The last of us' 
will show us what can really be done on the machine.</p> </li>

<p>Whenever the next gen shows up I don't think I'll be switching to it for a 
while. This gen's still going strong and I've got a lot of great games I can 
catch up on, meanwhile the new consoles can build up a library and maybe drop 
in price.<br>
No idea if I'll go with PS4 or 720 when I get round to the next 
gen. Exclusives and backwards compatibility are probably going to decide that 
for me so we'll see.</p> </li>

<p>Not surprised. They aren't ready for next year. Its a bad business decision 
for several reasons. Best let 360 soak up one more year of profits with Halo 4 
before moving on. That way your more prepared both hardware wise and software 
wise. I bet its revealed at next years E3 though. What audience MS is going for 
though is anybody's guess.</p> </li>

<p>I either want devs to dial down the graphics or for Sony/MS to bring out a 
new console soonish (or the Wii U), as both consoles struggle to keep 30fps a 
lot of the time without tearing, on multiplatform games especially.</p> </li>

<p>Well actually I think both consoles will launch at a similar time as not 
sure who at Sony said it but they didn;t want the same thing happening next 
time with there &quot;competitors&quot; getting a large headstart.</p>
<p>But anyway bring em on all I say - I want Full HD 1080p 60fps in all games 
and also maybe the extra ram would make skyrim work on PS3 (4) right </p> </li>

<p>If this was a real source I doubt they will be refering to it as the 720. 
I'd say someone is taking an educated guess. Probably right but still a guess.

<p>No no and no I completely disagree.</p>
<p>We have seen the best this gen can offer and it is the PC version.</p>
<p>Of course the 5+year old console technology can still release gems <br>
but 
you could also spend less time beating an old horse and more time being 
creative with a younger one </p>
<p>I suppose Microsoft is going to unify Windows 8 with the xbox (8box?) which 
will make game developemnt and portability cheaper also. That is going to be 
very important for even more expensive next-gen production values.</p> </li>

<p>If they do launch a new console in 2013 then I seriously very much doubt 
they will launch it at CES in January. It makes better business sense to 
announce it at E3, the worlds biggest games expo. And it would steal thunder 
from Nintendo and Sony then too. Also who is going to buy a 360, which they 
will still be spending money on making, if they know a new machine is out a 
year and a half or so later?</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm still utterly impressed with my 360 slim and the new dashboard 
and apps are ace, I am just really hoping for iPlayer now but doesn't look like 
it will get it </p> </li>

<p>What we need:</p>
<p>1- around 4GB of RAM- that would give the console a much longer life span 
and will allow much more things on screen (more enemies, bigger maps, and 
prettier in general).</p>
<p>2- HD 1080p as the normal setting (most TVs use it these days).</p>
<p>3- Less Massive (around the size of the slim if not smaller).</p>
<p>4- Less expensive (around the cost of a slim these days, so more people 
would buy it).</p>
<p>5- HUGE disc space (around 20-30 GBs) so future games can go wild whilst 
not having to deal with multiple discs.</p>
<p>6- Better XBOX LIVE functionality and much more entertainment like 
streaming TV channels...</p>
<p>7- Awesome games. Halo 5, a Gears sequel/prequel, Forza, a good Fable game 
and most importantly- MANY new exclusives. These days PS has twice or three 
times as much exclusives as the XBOX, and its a shame.</p> </li>

<p>Forgot to say. I hope this gen hasn't put Sony and MS off building a 
machine with all the extras included. Because look at the PS3 slim, such an 
inferior machine compared to the launch models!<br>
 I don't care about costs 
of consoles if I think it's worth the money and has games then I'll buy it. 
Whoever makes the best hardware next gen will be the one I will buy. I don't 
want to see lack of BC, I dont want to see 2 USB ports either!! I've got a 
external USB adapter for my PS3 because the slim only has 2 which is just 
pathetic at this day and age. It's got to be 6 minimum, I'm currently using 7 
USB ports. Yes I can keep p**sing about with swapping wires around all the time 
but there shouldn't be any need to.</p> </li>

<p> All peripheral devices should be totally wireless with a recharge method 
separate from the console. That way I don't have to have my console on when 
recharging and I don't have a pile of silly looking wires hanging from my 
console. Not interested in BC either. Plus with the next generation of games 
probably retailing at &pound;50+ I expect to be able to play the game online 
without having to pay anything extra if I buy the game new. They can charge for 
anything else but I expect to have access to every part of the game I just paid 
for.</p> </li>

<h6>Eclipse Dj on 15 Dec '11 said:</h6> 
<p>If this is true then the Wii U specs will need to be closer to the upcoming 
720/PS4 models instead of being at a lower scale offering a slight improvement 
on current 360/PS3 5+ year old tech. If Wii U isn't at the very least sitting 
somewhere in the middle of these two generations then I fail to see it's appeal 
to current 360/PS3 owners with the new consoles coming within a year of Wii U 
launch. It would also defeat the whole point of 'Wii U' offering traditional 
games and control method for the 'U' part. If it is hugely inferior in 
processing power you will not get the same multi-platform games anyway, thus 
yet again loosing out on a massive part of the gaming market.</p>
<p>Personally endless FPS and Racing games don't appeal much to me but if 
Nintendo are pitching the Wii U as a console that can be a jack of all trades 
then they better hope it doesn't end up being a master of none.</p>
<p>I'm sure Xbox 720 will come with some kind of Kinect camera straight out of 
the box, so Nintendo will really have to get a good footing to compete and have 
the processing power available to continue to compete for the coming 5-6 years.

leads and dongles wearing the ports out, not just that I like to keep all the 
clutter tidy.</p>
<p> Or should I get up every 5 mins to keep swapping them all around just to

 As it happens the cooling stand is a laptop cooling stand and it 
works a treat. It has 3 silent fans on it and it looks nice so I will use it 
seeing as the PS3 is poorly designed in a way that the solder joints melt on 
the CPU and GPU chips. All of my friends have suffered from this s**tty 
hardware failure, I've spent &pound;700 on hardware so I aren't taking my 
chances. Whether or not the stand helps is another discussion for another day 
but it doesn't make it any worse does it.....</p>
<p><br>
 Did I say that I have my DJ Hero dongle plugged in? No did I f**k I 
did use it at some point though taking up another USB port. But let's use DJ 
Hero 2 as an example, I'm getting that soon so if I only had 2 usb ports then 
I'd be stuck with just my DJ hero and headphones plugged in. That means when 
I'm sending messages (which I do all the time) I'd have to keep swapping them 
over.<br>
<br>
 And believe it or not but none of my stuff is out in the open. 
Apart from my headphones and keyboard, because I use both all of the time. Just 
don't be a tit and accept that not everyone uses their PS3 the same as you.</p>
<p>Oh and I forgot to say I also have my printer hooked up for printing photos 
and stuff off as that's where I keep my photos.</p>
<p> Alls I'm saying is that it would be nice to have extra USB ports seeing as 
Sony has made the PS3 compatible with so much stuff. You might not use your PS3 
for anything other than playing games on your own but some of us use it for 
other things.</p>
<p> I could keep going on with things like how the ps3 controller can only be 
charged when the ps3 is on therefore leaving out my keyboard again etc. It's 
just an inconvenience for me and I would like the option for extra ports.<br>

<br>As for the clutter comment. What I meant was, I like to keep my things in 
one place and don't want to keeping putting stuff lying around on the side 
looking a mess. It's just the way I am.</p> </li>

<p>Anyway that's the least of my worries next gen. Hardware reliability is top 
of the list for me. I don't want to see hardware failure on the level of PS3 
again it was abysmal. As for 360 that was just a p**s take.</p> </li>

<p> Just because the 360 is the worst hardware we've ever seen in a console, 
reliability wise, does not mean that the PS3 is ok having poor hardware 
reliability just because it doesn't look to bad compare to 360 </p> </li>

<p> PS3 reliable?  yeah compared to a 360 it is. I don't know anyone that 
isn't on their 2nd PS3 unless they are recent owners. There is no excuse for 
it. My PS3 lasted me 3 years! &pound;425 for 3yrs usage? That for me us s**t,

made s**te loads of extra sales because if it. I'd dare say out of the 50mil

<p>well, don't know a single slim that has failed. it's cool and quiet. well

<p>know a few phats that have went kaput. but that was relatively quickly 
redesigned.</p>
<p>with the big chips they start out on, they will be less reliable be nature, 
but MS's problem just keep perpetuating. a farce is the word for that debacle. 
if sony chose to put the power brick on the outside, they may not have failed

This point has actually been brought up several times. I think the 
difference in power between the machines won't be as big as some people seem to 
think. Microsoft *may* be willing to take a risk with power but will they is 
the question. As for Sony, the mistake of making PS3 a tech heavy as it is 
still haunts their finances today. I said I think the PS4 will be two PS3s duck 
taped together </p> </li>

<p>Hmm, this begets a difficult situation. I had pretty much decided there was 
no point in buying another console this gen. However, if I wait for the PS4 
then it's gonna be a<i>very</i> long wait. </p>
<p>May be the case that I'm tempted into a shamefaced purchase of the 720. 
Either that or I'll just have to make do with a Vita - I'm convinced it's a

<p>My PS3 fatboy, fine<br>
My PS3 slim I traded up to, after 2 years the power 
supply is failing, crap.</p>
<p>My original 360, first one failed after 3 months, replacement second 
machine was dead out of the box with red ring, the third one I then got began 
scratching DVD's after about 8 months. So poor I traded all my 360 gear in for 
the aforementioned PS3 fatboy.</p>
<p>My 360 slim, hasn't skipped a beat in 11 months, it's as reliable as the 
PS3 fatboy and is MUCH quieter then the PS3 slim, it is THE BEST console I have 
owned out the lot.</p>
<p>As for heat source? No, the CPU and GPU produce plenty of heat. </p>

<p>So many rumours re nextbox...i like it. Its fun. I do hope when it is 
released it is very powerful, lots of ram and a strong gpu, AI chip would be 
amazing and a physics chip. I hope it is as well made as the xbox360 S which is 
just a brilliant console, very well made, looks amazing too. Bring on E3 
2012....</p> </li>

<p>Not surprised. They aren't ready for next year. Its a bad business decision 
for several reasons. Best let 360 soak up one more year of profits with Halo 4 
before moving on. That way your more prepared both hardware wise and software 
wise. I bet its revealed at next years E3 though. What audience MS is going for 
though is anybody's guess.</p> </blockquote>
<p>My thoughts exactly, no one will buy Halo 4 if MS announce a new console, 
so I think a reveal at E3 2013 or late 2012 will be more likely.</p>
<p>But as I have had my hands burnt with the 360, 7 consoles so far, I will 
wait this time and see how the new console shapes up in terms of reliability , 
and anyhow there are 1000+ games for the 360 so it will keep you going for a 
few more years yet.</p> </li>

<p>What we need:</p> 
<p>1- around 4GB of RAM- that would give the console a much longer life span 
and will allow much more things on screen (more enemies, bigger maps, and 
prettier in general).</p> 
<p>2- HD 1080p as the normal setting (most TVs use it these days).</p> 
<p>3- Less Massive (around the size of the slim if not smaller).</p> 
<p>4- Less expensive (around the cost of a slim these days, so more people 
would buy it).</p> 
<p>5- HUGE disc space (around 20-30 GBs) so future games can go wild whilst 
not having to deal with multiple discs.</p> 
<p>6- Better XBOX LIVE functionality and much more entertainment like 
streaming TV channels...</p> 
<p>7- Awesome games. Halo 5, a Gears sequel/prequel, Forza, a good Fable game 
and most importantly- MANY new exclusives. These days PS has twice or three 
times as much exclusives as the XBOX, and its a shame.</p> </blockquote>
<p>1) Not going to happen, 2GB DDR 3 @ 1333Mhz to Run the OS &amp; background 
processes, and 1GB GDRR5 for games.</p>
<p>2) That will be a given.</p>
<p>3) NO heat will put a stop to that, unless they go for a VERY weak system.
</p>
<p>4) No still cheap &pound;350ish at the expense of top of the range 
components.<br>
(Don't frett double the CPU cores FX 6100, double the Ram for 
games, Quadruple the Ram for the system and background processes. And a 
&quot;custom&quot; GPU based off a HD6850 card, You can pick up both a FX 6100 
&amp; a HD6850 for &pound;229 and that's not buying in bulk like Microsoft 
will.)</p>
<p>5) No not going to happen gamers will have to be installed to the HDD. 
Possible disk with large slow read files to install to HDD from disk. And a 
possible nand cartridge with all fast files that need the data transfer rate, 
no more texture pop-in. The whole games need huge storage has always been Sony 
PR spin Skyrim is 6GB, it's the system not the disk that allows games to 
&quot;go wild&quot;.</p>
<p>6) Yes it will run a light version of Windows 8, the 2GB sytem Ram will 
allow for all that non-gaming crap, again at the expense of console exclusives.
</p>
<p>7) Right on the sequels, Microsoft will push the LIVE service as they do 
now, and in the process force Siverlight on the mobile sector. In short doing a 
apple.</p> </li>

<p>They can forget a 10 year lifecycle if they don't go for at least 4GB. They 
would be daft not to considering how cheap RAM is these days. Spending a tiny 
little bit more and putting 4-6GB of RAM instead of 2GB could significantly 
lengthen the lifespan of the console.</p>
<p>I would even go as far to suggest that had Sony and MS not cheaped out on 
the RAM in the 360/PS3, that we would probably be looking more along the lines 
of a 2015/2016 release for the next gen.</p>
<p>And given how the split memory pool has apparently hindered the PS3 aka 
Skyrim, would expect a shared memory pool for both the next gen xbox and ps4</p>

<p>The Xbox is a sixth-generation video game console manufactured by 
Microsoft. It was released on November 15, 2001 in North America, February 22, 
2002 in Japan, and March 14, 2002 in Australia and Europe. It was Microsoft's 
first foray into the gaming console market, and competed with Sony's 
PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast, and Nintendo's GameCube. The integrated Xbox 
Live service launched in November 2002 allowed players to play games online.</p>
<p>Xbox's successor, the Xbox 360, was launched in September 2005.</p>
<p>The Xbox was discontinued in late 2005 in Japan, late 2006 in Europe and 
early 2007 in North America. The last Xbox game was Madden NFL 09, released in 
August 2008. Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on 
March 2, 2009; any in-warranty repair now needed will not be undertaken and 
faulty consoles will be replaced with an Xbox 360 instead. Xbox Live support was

<p>How did I guess it was you again, Royston?</p>
<p>I really am perplexed how you can allow NEO_SUPERMAN and julioaragon to 
relentlessly troll every PS3 thread but resolutely ban me every time I poke a 
bit of light-hearted fun at the 360? I mean...read my first post in this 
thread, it's quite clearly a bit of jest and would've remained that way until 
old faithful decided he just had to get involved - GMCB not you.</p>
<p>If you take the time to look at my post history you'll see I've commented 
on many other topics. I would also point out that the tard above gives as good 
as he gets and pretty much gets involved at every opportunity - before me he 
was obsessed with this JBoo it seems. Little gimp called me a &quot;t**t&quot; 
before I had even attempted to address him with my new username. Now if that's 
not trying to call me out I don't know what is...</p>
<p>Admit it, you have an intrinsic grudge against any Sony fan who is a little 
more than outspoken. The manner in which you react to my obviously 
tongue-in-cheek comments more than proves this. Slightest sign of a hook and lo 
and behold there's a bloody great blue whale on the end of the line called

good old days of home computers. The PC would not be like it is today if it was 
not for the home computers like the Amiga and Atari sound and graphics 
capabilities of its time. So Sony/Microsoft a PS4 720 computer, programmable
