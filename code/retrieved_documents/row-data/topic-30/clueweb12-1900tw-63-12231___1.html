<p>By Tamoor Hussain for computerandvideogames.com </p> 
<p>Microsoft is to introduce TV-style 15-30 second ads to a wider range of 
Xbox Live media apps.</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
 The commercials were first introduced as part of the last major 
Xbox Live dashboard update and are currently displayed in apps such UFC, TMZ, 
and Crackle.
<p></p> 
<p>Going forward, the platform holder is planning to integrate these ads into 
content from providers including ESPN, Last.fm, Manga Entertainment, GameSpot 
and MUZU.TV.</p> 
<p>&quot;With the growth of Xbox Live, advertisers no longer have to choose 
between digital and TV advertising - we're offering the impact of TV and the 
interactivity and addressability of digital in one platform,&quot; Microsoft's 
Ross Honey, general manager of Xbox Live Entertainment and Advertising, told
Gamasutra.</p> 
<p>&quot;As more and more industry leaders like ESPN work with us to help 
monetize their content on Xbox Live, TV media buyers win with the ability to 
extend their standard TV spots to this highly engaged consumer audience.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The prominence of adverts on Xbox Live hasn't gone down well with players, 
many of whom pay a fee for access to the Gold tier of the service.</p> 
<p>Earlier this month a LinkedIn profile revealed that Microsoft aims to 
'further monetize' Xbox Live subscribers and has developed a plan to implement 
its new strategy by holiday 2012.</p> computerandvideogames.com <br>

<p>This is great news, now instead of watching game trailers and the like 
hassle free I can sit through 15-30 second ads, plus the ads that already are 
littered all over the dashboard all with the privilege of a paid for service.

<p>They'd better start reducing the cost of LIVE with all these adverts 
currently on the service, with more on the way - it's a joke.</p>
<p>If they start getting less game related (LYNX??!) then I'm going to have to 
consider switching back to my PS3 for online shenanigans.</p> </li>

<p>That is correct but, if they put them in front of game trailers and tghe

<p>Doesn't really suck, Im not going to be spitting my dummy out over a few 
ads. Especially when I pay a TV Licence, and subscription to Virgin Media and 
get ad's anyhow.. Its only the same. And in history videogames have had ad's 
directly inside the game.. that didnt bother me either.. Why? Cause im a little 
bit sensible enough to look beyond the ads &gt;.&lt;</p>

<p>you're right, but surely there's limits. Sky pays lot of money to buy 
rights to various channels and to show films etc. MS isnt paying for those 
things, and just increasing revenue further</p> </li>

<p>Agreed, just because Sky advertises with subscriptions does not mean that 
it's right! Sky doesn't have the greatest reputation, and definitely not the 
kind of company microsoft should be aspiring to.</p> </li>

<p>They are looking at a newe pricing model I believe. I bet you it goes up. 
This is why I play PS3 because it is free, it does not have everything Live has 
but all I want is to play games so why pay for that? It is a kick in the teeth 
paying &pound;50 per year for live, &pound;35 for CoD Elite and the cost of the 
game and the console. PSN will not be free forever though, Sony are losing 
money hand over fist and this is one commodity they can make new revenue 
streams.</p> </li>

<p>As long as their not invasive then its fine. It's when they get to the 
stage where you have 30 second unskippable adverts between operations that will 
make me annoyed. Although it would be nice is M$ passed some of the extra ad 
revenue back to its subscribers by lowering the price of Live subscriptions. I 
really, REALLY resent having to pay to play part of a product for which I have 
already payed over &pound;35.</p> </li>

I couldnt agree more, they are in the business of making money, and i 
dont find the adds intrusive, they dont bother me at all. Some people seem to 
have issue though, which is fair enough, but the point you made about Sky is 
correct.</p>
<p>I pay &pound;96 a month for sky, and i still have adverts, i pay the 
equivalent of &pound;2.50 a month for Live (if i shop smart for the 
subscription) and i kind of expect some sort of advertising.....And people dont 
go all Sony on me, you mark my words, they will be following MS example next 
Gen, i would bet anything they are kicking themselves they didnt do it from the 
start of this gen. Hence the introduction of PS Plus.</p> </li>

<p>Well I moaned about it because of how they present it like an exciting new

You are, as usual, the voice of reason. I hate being subjected to 
advertising myself, but I accept that the presence of advertising is a 
&quot;neccessary evil&quot;, if you see what I mean. Personally, I only use my 
360 for gaming, so I rarely even notice a dashboard ad, but when many 
commenters point out that an increase in advertising should lead to a reduction 
in the cost of XBL Gold, I find it impossible to disagree. </p> </li>

<p>I try Kes, I try, but its really hard on this site  .</p>
<p>I get what your saying, there is nothing worse than intrusive advertising 
(HELLO CVG &amp; TRIALS lol) but I don't think that's what you get on Live, 
sure its visible, but its not taking up the whole screen and you do need to 
clik into it (which means your interested in it) to actually view them.</p>
<p>For the last few years now, ive never paid more than &pound;30 for Live and 
though some people will RAGE at the thought of having to pay this, to me, it 
doesnt really matter. The price of Live hasnt went up since ive been using it 
and they have added tonnes of new content and partnerships compared to what 
there was at the beginning. I get that people dont like it, but for me, there 
are far more concerning issues to worry over about our favourite hobby than 
whether adverts appear on Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents though.</p> </li>

<p>The ads are a bit annoying, but seeing as I don't bother with any of the 
other crap on there like movies, music, social networking etc. and use my 360<i>
only</i> for playing games, they're not too much of a problem for me, 
personally.</p>
<p>Still, it does get on my tits a bit having to scroll through about four 
ad-saturated pages just to get to the games tab. Whose stupid idea was that?</p>

<p>Big difference between sky paying hundreds of millions a year for content, 
and MS having some apps, which in turn generate revenue for them anyway. If 
they paying Netflix money etc then I cant imagine would be lots, as it's in 
interest of them to have apps on live, as they generate income that way.</p>
<p>I agree people moan and whinge far too much in general, and need to pull 
heads out arses, gaming is a business afterall (some dude earlier going on as 
if it's his god given right to play games,and that gaming's too expensive, 
therefore piracy was justified etc etc, was worst example ive ever sen of self 
righteousness), but dont think the Sky/Live analogy works well due to expenses 
involved on behalf of Sky and Ms being vastly different.</p>
<p>I cant for life of me defend MS on this stance, as think it's deplorable, 
but hey they're a business and their prerogative. People either accept or dont 
, cause it's here to stay.</p> </li>

<p>To tell you the truth my main dislike with the 360 is the console booting 
up to an avatar,<br>
I truly despise being forced to have one.<br>
I liked the 
old blades too.<br>
What was once a very simple WYSIWYG is now a padded out and 
convoluted looping sales pitch.<br>
Where is my &pound;30 actually going?<br>
I 
really expect to see adblock as being a feature of xbox platinum or live+ at E3.

<p>Exactly. The problem with that plan Dodo is that they went in full force 
and didn't balance it out. Now, it seems to be a rare sight to hear about 
Microsoft announcing anything new in terms of exclusive games. I won't be 
suprised if their E3 conference this years lacks any bar Halo 4.</p>
<p>Yes, its handy to have all these great features but at the end of the day, 
I bought a games console for gaming first and other features second. Sony have 
done a pretty good job with keeping a balance between the two. I dunno, but 
maybe back in '06 I would try and justify the moves of Microsoft but now 
they're just spinning the drain.</p>
<p>Just another thing as well on topic; surely more revenue from advertisers 
should benefit us in the way of a cheaper Live subscription? I mean usually 
when you pay for membership online it usually removes the advertisements all 
together (TV is completely different since thats up to the actual channels not 
the suppliers) yet we don't seem to get anything bar the use of multiplayer 
gaming and access to apps that require futher spending to use. There seems to
