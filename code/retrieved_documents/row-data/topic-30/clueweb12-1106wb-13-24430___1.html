<p><strong>IntensaFIRE for Xbox 360 Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p> 
<br> <br>

<p><strong>Will this product work with both older and newer Xbox 360 
controllers?</strong></p> 
<p>This product works with all wireless Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers (CG, 
matrix, etc.). It does NOT work with wired controllers, only wireless. ones.</p>
<br> <br>

<p><strong>What tools &amp; materials are required to install the IntensaFire 
mod?</strong></p> 
<p>Everything you need to install the IntensaFIRE mod is included with the 
kit, including the special screwdriver and conductive glue. Ordinary household 
items that you will want to have on hand: Scotch tape, a toothpick, a 
hair-dryer (for a shorter drying time).</p> <br>
<br>
<strong>What does the 
IntensaFIRE mod do?</strong> 
<p>The IntensaFire modifies Xbox 360 controllers, allowing them to control 
5-mode sleeper settings (set up for different games' repetition allowances) 
with a simple D-Pad or Sync button toggle. It also enables &quot;dual 
rapid-fire&quot; - usable in all Xbox 360 games.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>What games are compatible with this mod?</strong></p> 
<p>The IntensaFIRE mod can be used with such gamer favorites as: Left 4 Dead, 
the Call of Duty series, the Halo series, the Gears of War series, and Street 
Fighter, as well as any other Xbox 360 game that utilizes a 'rapid-fire' 
function.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Is there an instruction video available for the installation 
process?</strong></p> 
<p>Yes, please view the <strong>IntensaFIRE Installation Video</strong> for 
step-by-step instructions on installing and programming the IntensaFIRE kit.</p>
<br> <br>

<p><strong>How do I set the programmable mode on my controller?</strong></p> 
<p>The <strong>IntensaFIRE Installation Video</strong> provides step-by-step 
instructions for programming Mode 5 for the IntensaFIRE.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>How can I find out how fast my shooting speed is when programming 
Mode 5 on my controller?<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>A <strong>Programmable Speed Settings chart</strong> is now available.</p> 
<br> <br>

<p><strong>I've installed the IntensaFIRE, but my right trigger isn't working 
correctly. Why?</strong></p> 
<p>The most common installation error is gluing the three right trigger points 
together. Each of the three points must be completely separate from the others, 
if the glue is touching at all, then the mod won't work. Also, be sure that you 
have attached the sync point correctly for the type of controller you are using.
<br> <br>
 If you are still having problems, you can try posting a picture of 
the installed board to the<strong>IntensaFIRE Discussion Forum</strong>. Our 
own installation techs and other knowledgeable gamers will offer suggestions 
there.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>After installing the IntensaFIRE, my controller will sometimes fire 
a random shot, even though I didn't pull the trigger. Does this mean that my 
mod is defective?</strong></p> 
<p>No, it is normal to experience an occasional single random shot from time 
to time. This is a by-product of the mod programming.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>While playing a game with the IntensaFIRE turned on, my controller 
will sometimes lock up for a moment and stop functioning. Does this mean my mod 
is defective?</strong></p> 
<p>No, it probably means that you are using the wrong mode or speed setting 
for the game you are playing. If the firing speed is too high, the game will 
cause your controller to lock up briefly.<br>
<br>
 The mod itself does not 
cause this phenomenon, most games have a script or coding that notices rapid 
fire and reacts by stopping it or locking it up. The way to prevent it is to 
use the correct pre-set mode for the game you are playing, or else to 
experiment until you find the fastest speed that does not trigger the game to 
stop you.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>What is your return policy for UNOPENED IntensaFIRE kits?</strong>

<p>UNOPENED Intensafire kits may be returned within 30 days of the purchase 
date for a refund of the product price. (Shipping fees are non-refundable.)

<p><strong>If I try to install the IntensaFIRE and ruin my controller, are you 
going to replace my controller?</strong></p> 
<p>This product is designed for use in official Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers 
only. During installation of this kit, caution must be taken not to damage the 
chip or any components of the controller. Be sure to follow all instructions 
carefully. We strongly recommend watching the<strong>IntensaFIRE Installation 
Video</strong> as well. <strong><em>BRE Software is not responsible for any 
damage to yourself, your controller, or your Xbox 360 console.</em></strong> 
There is nothing about the IntensaFIRE product itself that would cause any 
damage to your controller, as long as it is properly installed.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>How long will it take to receive my IntensaFIRE kit?</strong></p>

IntensaFIRE in my store. How can I purchase this item wholesale?</strong></p>

<strong>BRE Software Online Store</strong>.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Can I use an IntensaFIRE modded controller on Xbox Live?</strong>
</p> 
<p>While we don't recommend using modded controllers on Xbox LIVE, it's our 
understanding that they do not actively seek out and ban users for doing so. 
However, if you play in such a way that other users file complaints against 
you, then you could end up getting banned just on general principles.</p> <br>
