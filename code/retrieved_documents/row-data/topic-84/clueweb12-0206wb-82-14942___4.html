Questions About Goat Milk Kefir</h1> 
<h3>Q: What are probiotics?</h3> 
<p>A: Probiotics, which literally mean &quot;beneficial to life,&quot; are 
live cultures that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Most 
probiotics include the live active cultures often added to foods like yogurt. 
Researchers have studied bacteria extensively and considerable evidence 
indicates that there are several strains of essential bacteria that are good 
for you and that have the ability to promote healthy gastrointestinal 
functions, increase immunity and help prevent the development of cancer-causing 
toxins throughout the body.</p> 
<p>Redwood Hill Farm's Goat Milk Kefir has 10 live and active cultures that 
help produce a wide array of health benefits. Our custom blend of probiotics 
include: L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis, L. 
diacetylactis, S. thermophilus, L. cremoris, Leuconostoc cremoris and B. 
bifidum.</p> 
<h3>Q: Why should I add probiotics to my diet?</h3> 
<p>A: The bacteria in the digestive system play a very important role in our 
health and can easily be thrown out of balance by our everyday lifestyle. 
Factors that can upset this precious balance include: antibiotics (which 
sometimes kill both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; bacteria), infections 
(bacterial, viral and fungal), alcohol consumption, chronic diarrhea, travel, a 
highly processed low fiber diet and stress. Including probiotics in your diet 
is an easy way to help combat these stressors, keeping harmful bacteria in 
check.</p> 
<h3>Q: What is the difference between kefir and yogurt?</h3> 
<p>A: Although kefir and yogurt are similar in taste and texture, Redwood Hill 
Farm's Kefir has 10 live and active cultures, more than twice the amount of 
yogurt. Most yogurts have 2 or 3 cultures, while Redwood Hill Farm &amp; 
Creamery natural goat milk yogurt has four.</p> 
<h3>Q: What is the difference between cow milk kefir and goat milk kefir?</h3> 
<p>A: It's all in the milk! Goat milk protein, carbohydrates and fats are all 
easily digested. Goat milk is similar to human milk in its protein composition, 
having more short and medium-chain fatty acids, whereas cow milk tends to 
contain long-chain fatty acids. Cow milk contains agglutinin, which also 
hinders digestion. Agglutinin causes the fat particles in milk to group 
together, forming clusters which can be difficult for humans to digest.</p> 
<h3>Q: Can I have too much kefir?</h3> 
<p>A: You can have too much of any food. What is a healthy portion for one 
person can be harmful for another. Negative effects of kefir intake are not 
known, however, people with lactose intolerance should start with very small 
amounts like a teaspoon at a time to see how they do. That being said, most 
people with lactose intolerance can consume kefir because the bacteria and 
beneficial yeast in the kefir feed on the lactose.</p> 
<h3>Q: Does your kefir contain gluten?</h3> 
<p>A: Not a bit! Redwood Hill Farm Goat Milk Kefir, like all of our natural 
dairy products, contains no gluten nor do we produce any products in our 
creamery that contain gluten. In addition kefir is a naturally low glycemic 
food.</p> 
<h3>Q: Why don't you add inulin to your kefir like other brands?</h3> 
<p>A: Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), or inulin, is a soluble fiber often 
referred to as a &quot;prebiotic.&quot; Essentially it serves as fertilizer for 
the bacteria in your colon. Studies show that inulin/FOS seems to favor certain 
lactobacillus species of bacteria, especially the Bifidus species.</p> 
<p>For this reason, it is being promoted as a supplement to feed the 
&quot;good bacteria&quot; in our stomachs. Studies show that inulin can also 
increase the absorption of several minerals, including calcium, which is why it 
is so prevalent in dairy products.</p> 
<p>Although inulin has many beneficial actions, there are disadvantages for 
some people; primarily taking inulin when the colon is filled with 
&quot;bad&quot; bacteria and yeast because inulin may promote their growth as 
well.&nbsp; Recent studies have shown that inulin encourages the growth of 
Klebsiella, a bacteria implicated in Ankylosing Spondylitis and in increased 
intestinal permeability (leaky gut). In addition, there has been one documented 
case of anaphylactic (allergic) reaction to inulin, and foods containing it can 
be rather gassy.</p> 
<p>Inulin is found naturally in many foods and we believe this is the best way 
to utilize its many health benefits. Asparagus, garlic, onions, Jerusalem 
artichokes, chicory root and leeks to name a few. Instead of adding refined, 
super concentrated inulin to your food, we recommend eating the foods that 
naturally contain inulin.</p> 
<h3>Q: Why does my bottle of kefir sometimes puff out and make a little 
&quot;pop&quot; noise when I open it?</h3> 
<p>A: The live bacteria in kefir produce CO2 as a by-product, which will cause 
the bottle to expand. This is a good thing as it is a sign of the live and 
active cultures in your kefir.</p> 
<h3>Q: Why is Kefir tangy and slightly carbonated, or bubbly?</h3> 
<p>A: Since our Kefir contains live and active cultures, there will be a 
small, varying degree of effervescence. This means that the probiotic kefir 
cultures are active and working. This does not mean the product is spoiled in 
any way. Spoiled kefir will resemble spoiled milk and have a very pungent odor.
</p> 
<h3>Q: How can I flavor Redwood Hill Farm Traditional Plain Kefir?</h3> 
<p>A: With your favorite fruit and extracts. One of our favorites is adding 
maple syrup and pomegranate juice!</p> 
<h3>Q: Can I use Kefir in cooking?</h3> 
<p>A: Absolutely! Try Kefir in any recipe where yogurt, sour cream or 
buttermilk is called for.</p> 
<h3>Q: What kind of milk is your kefir made from?</h3> 
<p>A: Redwood Hill's Natural Cultured Kefir is made with 100% fresh grade A 
goat milk from our family of farms.</p> <br>
