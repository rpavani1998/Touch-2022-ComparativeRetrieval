<h2>Producing Quality Goat Milk</h2> 
<p>By<br>
George F. W. Haenlein <br>
Cooperative Extension Dairy Specialist 
<br>University of Delaware </p> 
<p> <b>ABSTRACT</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Mounting evidence indicates several basic differences in goat and cow 
physiology, biochemistry, microbiology and in the composition of their milk. 
Standards based on research with dairy cows are discriminatory to dairy goats 
in many aspects and must be replaced by suitable goat milk standards. Practices 
which assure safe and wholesome quality of goat milk are based on dairy cow 
experiences but must be confirmed for applicability to goat husbandry, not only 
for microbiological safety, but also for acceptability of taste and odor, which 
so far has been a widespread major deterrent to public acceptance of goat milk, 
and therefore impedes its use in human nutrition where medical reasons indicate 
its value.</p> 
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Why goat milk? This is a critical question to be asked and answered by all 
who are trying help establish a dairy goat business and industry. The value of 
goat milk in human nutrition has so far received very little factual and 
academic attention (Haenlein, 1984, 1988, 1992; Park, 1991). However, if we can 
not and do not identify and promote facts of the role, and superiority in 
certain instances, of goat milk in human nutrition, we will have a hard time 
justifying growth of the goat business as an industry next to the dairy cattle 
business. As the milk supply from cows is more plentiful and cheaper, we have 
the challenge to demonstrate why there are good reasons to produce goat milk; 
if not, we are strictly only in the pet business.</p> 
<p>Despite a widespread absence of infrastructural organization for goat milk 
in the USA, more commercial successes with goat milk marketing are becoming 
known in recent years (Loewenstein et al., 1980; Kapture, 1982; Haenlein, 1985; 
Pinkerton, 1991; Hankin, 1992; Jackson, 1992). Also, significant new research 
station efforts in Texas, California, Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and 
Pennsylvania have been advancing new knowledge of goat milk production on the 
farm, and of the physiology, biochemistry and veterinary aspects of the animal 
in recent years. Besides that, a new scientific journal Small Ruminant Research 
has become established by the International Goat Association on a monthly basis 
and with broad international support since 1988. And the volumes of new 
scientific data presented at four major quintannual international goat 
conferences have become widely circulated. Thus it is high time to include in 
these developments the sanitarians for establishing quality standards, and the 
medical profession for evidence on the medical and nutritional benefits of goat 
milk.</p> 
<p><b>MEDICAL RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR GOAT MILK</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Powerful justification for goat milk can come from medical needs, 
especially for infants afflicted with various ailments, including cow milk 
protein sensitivities. Swedish studies have shown that cow milk was a major 
cause of colic, sometimes fatal, in 12 to 30 percent formula-fed, less than 
3-month-old infants (Lothe et al., 1982). In breast-fed infants, colic was 
related to the mother's consumption of cow milk (Baldo, 1984; Cant et al., 
1985; Host et al., 1988). In older infants, the incidence of cow milk protein 
intolerance was approximately 20 percent (Nestle, 1987).</p> 
<p>A popular therapy among pediatricians is the change to vegetable protein 
soy-based formula; however, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of all infants with 
cow milk protein intolerance will also react adversely to soy proteins (Lothe 
et al., 1982). Approximately 40 percent of all patients sensitive to cow milk 
proteins tolerate goat milk proteins (Brenneman, 1978; Zeman, 1982), possibly 
because lactalbumin is immunospecific between species (Hill, 1939).</p> 
<p><b>BIOCHEMICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOAT MILK AND COW MILK</b> <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Goat milk proteins have many significant differences in their amino acid 
compositions from the milk of other mammalian species, especially in relative 
proportions of the various milk proteins and in their genetic polymorphisms 
(Jenness, 1980; Boulanger et al., 1984; Addeo et al., 1988; Ambrosoli et al., 
1988). The major protein in cow milk is alpha-s-1-casein, but goat milk may 
differ genetically by having either none (&quot;Null&quot; type) or much 
(&quot;High&quot; type). Null types have shorter rennet coagulation time, less 
resistance to heat treatment, curd firmness is weaker, pH is higher, protein 
and mineral contents in milk are lower, and cheese yields are less than in high 
types. This in turn indicates and may explain significant differences to cow 
milk in digestion by infants and patients (Mack, 1953), which traditionally 
have been explained by the &quot;homogenized&quot; nature of goat milk fat.</p> 
<p>Actually, the composition of goat milk fat may be much more important than 
the prevalence of large numbers of small fat globules, because it too differs 
significantly from the composition of cow milk fat under average feeding 
conditions (Haenlein, 1992). The various components of milk fat, fatty acids, 
differ in carbon chain length and saturation, which has nutritional and medical 
significance. Goat milk fat normally has 35 percent of medium chain fatty acids 
(C6-C14) compared to cow milk fat 17 percent (Table 1), and three are named 
after goats: Caproic (C6), caprylic (C8), capric (C10), totaling 15 percent in 
goat milk fat versus only 5percent in cow milk fat. Besides their unique 
flavor, which has serious consequences in improper handling of goat milk, these 
medium chain fatty acids (MCT) have become of considerable interest to the 
medical profession, because of their unique benefits in many metabolic diseases 
of humans (Babayan, 1981).</p> 
<p>Capric, caprylic and other MCT have been used for treatment of 
malabsorption syndromes, intestinal disorders, coronary diseases, pre-mature 
infant nutrition, cystic fibrosis, gallstone problems, because of their unique 
metabolic abilities of providing energy and at the same time lowering, 
inhibiting and dissolving cholesterol deposits (Schwabe et al., 1964; 
Greenberger and Skillman, 1969; Kalser, 1971; Tantibhedhyangkul and Hashim, 
1975, 1978). It seems apparent that in this area is great potential for 
identifying a unique importance and role for goat milk, specifically goat milk 
fat and probably goat milk butter, which has not received much attention at 
all. And all this adds even more importance to the establishment of acceptable 
practices and standards for quality goat milk production, which so far has been 
lagging behind those for dairy cows, but which require separate establishment 
because of the many unique physiological and metabolic characteristics of goats 
compared to cows (Haenlein, 1980, 1987a, 1991; Hinckley, 1990; 
Kalogridou-Vassiliadou et al., 1992).</p> 
<p><b>MONITORS OF QUALITY MILK STANDARDS</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>This discussion is limited to the effects the farm producer can and will 
have on the quality of milk, which is a most perishable and most fragile 
product, easily affected negatively by improper feeding of the animals, 
improper handling of them prior and during milking, improper handling of the 
milk during and after milking including improper equipment handling, cooling 
and transportation (Haenlein, 1987b). To safeguard quality milk production, at 
least 5 major parameters are routinely monitored by various agencies which have 
jurisdiction over the production of milk through commercial channels:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Nutritional constituents in milk. </li> 
<li>Somatic cell counts as related to mastitis. </li> 
<li>Bacteria counts as related to sanitary practices. </li> 
<li>Adulteration and pesticide residue contents. </li> 
<li>Flavor, taste, appearance and temperature. </li> </ol> 
<p>These five parameters need to be at optimum or it will cost the farmer 
money, directly or indirectly. If milk composition is below minimum market 
standards, if somatic cell counts and bacteria levels indicate mastitis or 
unclean and improper handling, if milk is off in appearance, flavor, taste and 
temperature, if milk contains water or veterinary or sanitary treatment or 
pesticide residues or traces of toxic molds from feeds, then entire loads of 
milk shipment or tanks can be unsalable, can be condemned and a big financial 
loss to the farmer, jeopardizing even future milk sales.</p> 
<p>Technology has come to the farmers' aid and enabled great progress in 
sanitary milking and milk house facilities in recent years. It is in the 
farmers' direct financial interest to take advantage of this technology, which 
can deliver milk from the mammary gland of goats to the cooling tank and 
processing plant without ever coming in contact with barn air, with other 
animals or the workers. This can eliminate a whole host of environmental odors, 
microbes, contaminations and assure a truly quality milk. However, technology 
requires its own proper care and sanitary management, otherwise it will lead to 
oxidation, contamination, bacteria invasion, and loss of the quality of milk it 
was meant to assure.</p> 
<p>What then can the goat milk producer do to assure the best quality and best 
possible income from the sale of his milk, especially when instead of modern 
technology the traditional hand-milking is still practiced? Information from 
dairy cow production and cow milk research can help in advising goat milk 
producers, while research with goat milk production and handling is just 
starting in the United States, more found in foreign languages or non-existing. 
This has led to the unfortunate application of cow milk standards by regulatory 
sanitary officials to goat milk in commerce, in the absence of established 
separate goat milk standards, and to the detriment of goat milk producers.</p> 
<p><b>GOAT MILK FLAVOR</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Acceptable, attractive milk odor and taste is probably the single most 
important quality standard of goat milk, because of a long history of 
widespread negative popular perception of goat milk being &quot;goaty.&quot; In 
fact, the national U.S. dairy products judging procedures list 
&quot;goaty&quot; as one of the four odor characteristics of bad versus good 
milk, cheese, yoghurt, cream and butter. Goaty odor does not need to happen, 
because well produced and well handled goat milk is indistinguishable in taste 
and odor from quality cow milk. Although goat milk has a higher content of the 
strong smelling caproic, caprylic and capric acids in its milk fat, with good 
milking practices they are enclosed within the fat globule membrane. This 
membrane is, however, more fragile in goat milkfat than in cow milkfat, is 
easily broken during improper handling, insufficient cooling and repeated 
rewarming, and then enzymes are liberated that can produce odors.</p> 
<p>Many sources can be identified for off-flavors in cow milk and the same 
applies to goat milk: feeds (molasses, citrus pulp), forages (rape, rapeseed 
meal), weeds (onions, garlic), environmental odors (oil, gasoline, moldy rags, 
lime, cement, active bucks); normal physiology (early lactation colostrum, late 
lactation high salt contents, estrus, mastitis, sickness); improper handmilking 
procedures; improper equipment and handling (oxidation due to risers in milking 
pipelines, vacuum slips and searches, sun exposure, filthy clogged strainers 
and pipeline connections, unclean milking equipment, wash water not hot); slow 
air cooling instead of water cooling or refrigeration; variable temperature 
during storage, addition of warm milk to cold storage milk, transport in 
unrefrigerated containers, etc.</p> 
<p>Good procedures exist about how to best achieve acceptable milk flavor and 
with it production of quality milk:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Clean milking equipment, cans, strainers, pipeline, tank. </li> 
<li>Healthy and clean animals and udders. </li> 
<li>Proper feeding, ration balance, meeting nutrient and especially mineral 
requirements.</li> 
<li>No feeding of milking animals prior to milking for at least 2 hours, 
especially not of feeds and forages with odors.</li> 
<li>Clean air in separate milking room, and clean hands and cloths when 
hand-milking.</li> 
<li>Dry, clean wiped udders and teats; forestripped teats. </li> 
<li>Proper, sufficient and steady vacuum during machinemilking. </li> 
<li>Low &quot;true&quot; somatic cell counts (neutrophil leukocytes) in milk. 
</li> 
<li>Low socalled preincubation and standard plate counts of bacteria in milk; 
and low cold-resistant bacteria count in milk.</li> 
<li>Rapid water cooling or refrigeration after milking. </li> 
<li>Constant low milk storage temperatures, including during transportation. 
</li> 
<li>Equipment to be washed with very hot water (120 F, or higher, depending on 
length of exposure) after an initial lukewarm rinse after each milking a.m. and 
p.m., and final sanitizing solution before each milking; sanitizing rinses 
between milking of individual animals is of advantage when disease cases occur, 
but this is only effective when fresh solutions are applied for each new rinse, 
or if &quot;backflushing&quot; is part of the equipment procedure.</li> </ol> 
<p><b>QUALITY TESTING</b> </p> 
<p>To monitor the concerns for quality milk production, a number of gauges and 
tests can be routinely used on dairy goat farms. Often it is difficult to 
overcome seasonal breeding and the then common late stage of lactation in all 
goats, which means that at some time of the year most members of a goat herd 
are in late lactation with naturally high levels of salt, solids and somatic 
cell counts in their milk. CMT (California Mastitis Test) checking of udder 
halves should be routine and can make a difference in quality control of goat 
milk.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>The National Mastitis Council has promoted effective mastitis control 
programs, the so called 5-point program for reduction in somatic cell counts 
states:<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>1. Use only functionally adequate milking machines, or hand-milking in the 
correct manner.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>2. Dip teats after each milking with an effective, approved product. <br>

<br></p> 
<p>3. Administer promptly a full series of recommended treatments to all 
clinical cases of mastitis.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>4. Treat udder halves at drying-off of goats with an approved antibiotic 
preparation for drying-off.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>5. Cull animals with chronic infections when they do not respond to 
treatments.</p> 
<p>I add to this list: Don't use milk for sale from udders with very high 
somatic cell counts or high CMT. Feed that milk to chickens, pigs or a calf.<br>
<br></p> 
<p>And I also add: Don't let goats rest on concrete floors during the cold 
season, provide wooden slatted, false floors or warm clean bedding, or natural 
pasture, to keep udders from getting cold chills and infections.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Goat milk must be cooled like it is officially prescribed down to the 
holding temperature range of 36 to 42o F within a short time after milking. 
This is not possible by air cooling, only by water cooling, agitated exposure 
to refrigerated tank walls, and in counter-current heat exchange coolers. Once 
cool, quality goat milk must be held in the 36 to 42o F range without 
interruption nor variation to maintain its quality and long shelf-life.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>A quality bonus payment helps efforts in achieving and maintaining 
high-quality milk. Milk composition and yield changes with mastitis, even 
subclinical mastitis, which has visibly normal milk but high somatic cell 
counts. Some components in milk, such as whey proteins, lactose, lipase, 
sodium, chloride increase with mastitis, while milk fat, solids, casein, 
calcium, phosphorus, potassium and cheese yield decrease. Thus, taste quality 
of goat milk is directly affected by the status of udder health.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>INSPECTION AND LAB REPORTS <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Dairy lab reports provide several milk quality criteria required by local, 
state and federal health inspectors:<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>1. Standard plate counts (SPC) of bacteria should be less than 10,000 per 
milliliter.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>2. Pre-incubation count (PIC) of specific bacteria should be less than 
20,000.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>3. Direct microscopic somatic cell count (DMSCC) should be less than 
300,000.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>4. Direct microscopic count (DMC) should be less than 30,000. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>5. Temperature resistant bacteria count (THC) should be less than 1,000. 
<br><br>
</p> 
<p>6. Freezing point temperature decrease or cryoscopy (CRY) in degrees C 
below zero must be between -0.530 and -0.550, which indicates absence of water 
in milk.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>7. Antibiotics or growth inhibitors (ABI) in milk must be negative. <br>

<br></p> 
<p>8. Holding temperature (TEM) of the milk should be between 34 and 39 
degrees F always.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>These tests monitor trouble due to animals, equipment and people. The 
California Mastitis Test (CMT), obtainable from any feed or supply dealer is an 
excellent farm-side monitor, even for goats, and should be used often and 
regularly on each goat and each udder half. Even better yet is the monthly 
somatic cell count (SCC) testing of each goat in the herd under the DHIA 
program, if the somatic cell counting is not by the Coulter counter.<br>
<br>

</p> 
<p>MILK SECRETION IS DIFFERENT IN GOATS <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>The most obvious difference in anatomy is that there are only two teats on 
the goat udder vs. four on cow udders. Less obvious is the relatively larger 
inside volume of the teat and gland cysterns. That is why good goat udders look 
much more collapsed and empty after milking than cow udders. The smaller, 
tighter diameter of the teat sphincter and meatus of goat udders makes milking 
and milking-out somewhat different. Also, the milk let-down effect in goats 
takes only a few seconds compared to one minute in cows. Goat manure should 
always be pellets and drier than cow manure, which is much higher in water 
content or normally sloppy and easily soiling the flanks and udders of cows, 
while goats stay normally dry and have clean flanks and udders. This difference 
makes milking preparation procedures for goats potentially much easier to be 
sanitary. It is not risky to only dry clean goat teats and udders for the 
milking of low-bacteria-count goat milk. Also, prevalent bacteria and pathogens 
in goat udders are often of different species than in cow udders.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Seasonal reproduction, usual in this country, is another important 
difference in milking goats. Cows are bred in every month of the year, 
therefore their milk is always a composite of early, middle and late stage 
lactation. Goats, unless specially treated, breed only in early fall and are 
fresh only in early spring, normally. Thus, at various times of the year, dairy 
goats are all in early, or middle, or late stage of lactation, accentuating 
normal seasonal milk composition changes, that are related to stages of 
lactation, to estrus and low amounts of milk. For example, fat, protein and 
somatic cells in milk normally are high in early and late lactation in cows and 
in goats, while lactose is usually the opposite.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>All these differences might give already doubts about the validity of using 
the same standards for evaluating milk of the two species. Not surprisingly, 
the compositional differences are also part of physiological differences in the 
secretion process of milk from inside the udder from the alveolar cells. Cow 
milk secretion has been termed &quot;merocrine,&quot; which is defined as 
&quot;the act of secretion leaves the cell intact.&quot; Goat milk secretion, 
on the other hand, has been termed by researchers &quot;apocrine,&quot; which 
is defined as &quot;the secretion-filled free end of a gland cell is pinched 
off, leaving the nucleus and most of the cytoplasm to recover and repeat the 
process.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>SOMATIC CELL COUNTS</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Equipment for monitoring somatic cell count (SCC) levels in cow milk 
includes the CMT applied in the barn, and electronic automated machines in 
labs, the so-called Coulter Counter, or the Fossomatic, which use different 
chemical principals to achieve supposedly the same SCC evaluations.</p> 
<p>The important question of whether these three worldwide adopted methods and 
the legal threshold set by Public Health officials of 1 million SCC/ml milk 
apply to cow and goat milk equally accurately and validly, despite the many 
mentioned differences in the physiology and composition of milk of the two 
species has only recently begun to be studied (Haenlein, 1987a, b; Hinckley, 
1991; Kalogridou-Vassiliadou et al., 1992). Research has established that the 
SCC in cow milk is indicative of, although less than equal, the number of 
leukocytes in milk, which of course indicates subclinical or clinical mastitis. 
In contrast, goat milk contains from the apocrine secretion process many 
non-leucocytic cell particles, that do not have DNA or a nucleus as leukocytes 
do. Thus, only SCC methods which specifically identify DNA, give valid counts 
of leukocytes in goat milk. Socalled &quot;total somatic cell count&quot; is 
not only unreliable, but useless and wrong for inspectors monitoring legal 
thresholds of quality of goat milk.</p> 
<p>It was determined that visibly normal goat milk had less numbers of 
pathogenic bacteria than cow milk under similar conditions. Relationships 
between SCC from CMT and Fossomatic were similar for goat or cow milk. However, 
absolute SCC numbers rose much higher in normal goat milk than expected from 
cow milk, which suggests that the goat udder responds to pathogens much more 
actively than cow udders do.</p> 
<p>It was also concluded that if CMT scores were used for legal thresholds, at 
CMT-1, a misclassification of 52percent of normal goat milk would occur. A 
legal threshold of 1 million SCC/ml would misidentify 25percent and 35percent 
of bacteriologically negative, i.e. normal goat milk by the Coulter Counter and 
Fossomatic methods, respectively.</p> 
<p>Not included in these studies were additional normal SCC increases due to 
advancing lactation, since only the first 6 months of lactation were tested. 
This will then be expected to further increase the absolute levels of SCC in 
normal goat milk above those reported in the studies so far. Finally, these 
tests used only fore-milking samples, while it is known that the last 
strippings are higher in SCC. Thus, absolute levels of SCC in bulk tank goat 
milk containing all milk portions, fore, middle and last, would be expected to 
be higher yet than in the studies, regardless of season of year or stage of 
lactation, influencing the setting of the legal threshold.</p> 
<p>Valuable research information on goat milk mastitis and somatic cell counts 
has been published by Caruolo, Dulin, Hinckley, Lerondelle, Maisi, Nesbakken, 
Park, Poutrel; and Judy Kapture (Portage, WI), ADGA member on the National 
Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments has very actively pursued the problem 
of somatic cell count legal thresholds. Their conclusions are that:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The Coulter Counter is not reliable for goat milk. </li> 
<li>The only officially acceptable method to confirm high cell counts in goat 
milk is the DMSCC (direct microscopic somatic cell count) using the special 
pyronine Y-methyl green stain (Standard Methods/Dairy Products 1985, pp. 
229-230), or another appropriate method determining DNA contents.</li> 
<li>The Fossomatic may be accurate in mid-lactation, but results need to be 
confirmed with the pyronine Y stain.</li> 
<li>The CMT can be used as a screening test but high counts must be confirmed 
with the pyronine Y stain.</li> 
<li>SCC levels of normal goat milk increase from spring to fall well above the 
cow threshold of 1 million/ml, starting about 4 months after kidding, 
coinciding with start of estrus and late stage of lactation.</li> 
<li>Easily achievable SCC levels of 100 to 300,000 SCC/ml in cow milk are 
unusual in even high-quality managed goat herds.</li> </ol> 
<p><b>QUALITY ASSURANCE</b> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Recently, the National Milk Producers Federation joined forces with the 
American Veterinary Medical Association to develop a &quot;quality assurance 
protocol&quot; plan and campaign, that should ensure freedom from drug residues 
in milk such as sulfamethazine, other sulfonamides, antibiotics gentamicin, 
erythromycin, oxytetracycline, other pesticides and even toxic mold residues, 
etc. The public does not want safe, low-level residues in milk, but demands 
zero-tolerance, totally residue-free milk. Thus, quality production and 
handling of milk is a real challenge for the goat farmer as it is for the cow 
farmer. It can be done and is being done more and more.</p>
