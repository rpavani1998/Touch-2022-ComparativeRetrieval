<h3>Skim or Whole?</h3> 
<p> <br>
 It depends on your taste. While you've probably always been told to 
drink reduced-fat milk, the majority of scientific studies show that drinking 
whole milk actually improves cholesterol levels, just not as much as drinking 
skim does.<br>
<br>
 One recent exception: Danish researchers found that men 
who consumed a diet rich in whole milk experienced a slight increase in LDL 
cholesterol (six points). However, it's worth noting that these men drank six 
8-ounce glasses a day, an unusually high amount. Even so, their 
triglycerides--another marker of heart-disease risk&acirc;&#128;&#148;decreased 
by 22 percent.<br>
<br>
 The bottom line: Drinking two to three glasses of milk 
a day, whether it's skim, 2 percent, or whole, lowers the likelihood of both 
heart attack and stroke&acirc;&#128;&#148;a finding confirmed by British 
scientists.<br>
<br>
 If you're dieting, the lower-fat option is an easy way to 
save a few calories. When it comes to building muscle, though, whole milk may 
be your best choice: Scientists at the University of Texas medical branch in 
Galveston found that drinking whole milk after lifting weights boosted muscle 
protein synthesis&acirc;&#128;&#148;an indicator of muscle 
growth&acirc;&#128;&#148;2.8 times more than drinking skim did.</p>

<p>There is so much pseudo science out there masquerading as nutrition it is a 
wonder we eat anything at all anymore. Thanks for the great article.<br>
<br>
 
For those who are really concerned about milk with bovine growth hormones and 
the like you can avoid this by going to Whole Foods and purchasing their 365 
Store Brand milk. It is hormone free and the cost in my area (Raleigh, NC) is 
lower than milk in other grocery chains.<br>
<br>
 Drink up!</p>

<p>What about Lactose-free milk? Are any of the effects/benefits of milk 
altered through consumption of lactose-free as opposed to regular? Also, would 
drinking the hormone free options remove the need to drink lactose-free milk?

<p>Unlike the U.S. our goverment doesn't allow hormones in our milk in Canada. 
(So they say) and from what I've sen and read, guys need dairy as much as 
women, especially to keep their bones stronger when old age sets in.</p>

 I found out I have cancer at the end of June 2009. I received an 
article from either John Hopkins or M D Anderson that says milk, white bread, 
white rice,and sugar are bad for cancer patients. Until I find out how I;m 
doing I will try and refrain from eating any of the above, or at least a 
minimal amount of usage</p> 
<h4>Arthur</h4> 
<h5>October 12, 6:30pm</h5> </li>

<p>We don't need the hormones or antibiotics that milk has and we can't digest 
the lactose and the calcium in it is casinate which 99% of people can't absorb 
any way....so if you need milk for cereal or baking then get fat free lactose 
free milk and lactose free ice cream and there is now lactose free string 
cheese. The only nutrient thats good for you in it is protien. There are some 
good alternitive milks you can buy and they aren't from a cow.</p> 
<h4>Sydney</h4> 
<h5>October 12, 6:30pm</h5> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Seth is right. All that concern about hormones in our foods are coming from 
the uneducated. The (IGF-I) which is what we would be looking at is the same in 
bst treated cows as in regular cows. Another important thing is, hormones are 
proteins which we know proteins are unwound and broken down in our stomach so 
it would not have any effect on the rest of our body because we break it down 
then use it for what we need it for. The only reason antibiotic use is a 
problem is because bacteria in the animal can adapt. So the antibiotics become 
less effective with that bacteria in humans and animals.</p>

<p>All I can say is if milk was in fact as horrible for you as some people 
make it out to be, I think we as a society would know this by now and be able 
to clearly link consuming milk to certain diseases or what have you. I 
personally had a liver transplant and have heart problems and was told in both 
instances to drink about 1 quart of milk a day in order to strenghten my heart 
and boost my immune system as it is weakened due to medication.</p>

<p>What other animals drink Milk after Infancy? You won't see any because 
mothers stop lactating naturally.<br>
<br>
 Now I wouldn't say to stay away 
from milk completely, I have sinus issues and milk makes them worse, but I'll 
have yogurt nearly everyday.<br>
<br>
 Do everything in moderation, and stay 
away from chugging a glass of milk and eating ice cream.</p> 
<h4>Skylar</h4>

<p>Seth and all who agree with him: I am appalled by the statement that 
&quot;there is too much concern about what's in our food.&quot; How stupid can 
you be? How can you NOT be concerned about what you eat? How about this: You 
lot can go ahead and swallow the &quot;information&quot; the food-companies are 
feeding you and eat your genetically modified meat-products and produce. I'll 
eat my food the way nature gave it to us. We'll see who's healthier 30 years 
down the road.</p> 
<h4>Anthony</h4>

<p>I agree with Mark. If milk was so bad, there would serious sickness 
everywhere. Some people have a vested interest in scaring people; some people 
are just paranoid. Of course, that's easy in today's sensationalistic society. 
People have been drinking milk for thousands of years!<br>
<br>
 And the 
argument that &quot;what other animals drink milk after infancy?&quot; I have a 
question for you: how many animals take insulin? Or antibiotics? Or have heart 
surgery?<br>
 My point: men HAVE improved on nature. Being &quot;natural&quot; 
ain't all it's cracked up to be. Ask a diabetic to go without insulin and see 
what they say.</p>

<p>1) This a great article about the TRUTH of milk.<br>
<br>
 2) ALL milk you 
find in grocery stores IS antibiotic free. No milk consumed by humans will ever 
contain antibiotics due to the RIGOROUS testing at every manufacturing facility 
as mandated by the government. A sample is taken at each dairy farm before 
being loaded into the tanker. Then another sample is taken of the tanked as a 
whole before it unloads at the manufacturing plant and must test negative 
before it can be unloaded.<br>
<br>
 3) r-BST is a BOVINE hormone, therefore it 
is indigestible to anything other than bovines...aka cows.<br>
<br>
 4) British 
scientists have proved that chocolate milk is one of the best post workout 
drinks available, due to its protein/fat ratio. Google it.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing my attention to the notmilk site. I had no idea there 
existed such a wealth of reaearch about milk and it's potential negative health 
effects. &quot;Special interest group&quot;? Yeah, I suppose they're especially 
interested in educating the public about milk, milk products and their friends. 
While I haven't thoroughly studied the site what I have seen seems legitimately 
well-researched and appropriately referenced. Included are research and news 
articles from a diverse group of sources including those who would benefit from 
the sale of milk and milk products. Thank you, Men's Health. Thank 
you,notmilk.com<br>

<p>Human beings are the only mammals on the face of the planet that drink the 
milk of another animal, for nutritional value. More so, we continue to drink it 
in to adult stage. Surely if mother nature wanted &quot;us&quot; to drink milk 
as adults, we'd be visiting our mother with much greater frequency.</p>

<p>I have studied the &quot;Milk&quot; issue for the past two years. In 
summary I have come to the conclusion that cow's/goat's milk is totally 
unnecessary for human consumption.<br>
<br>
 To cut a long research story 
short, readers here should check out &quot;Dr. Kradjian Milk Letter&quot; and 
yes it is also listed on notmilk.com web site. It's a long letter but his 
findings also agree with what I have discovered/uncovered all this time. THAT 
LETTER REALLY NAILS IT ALL.<br>
<br>
 Briefly, we drink/drank milk out of habit 
from childhood. Primitive tribes have none of the problems that we have owing 
to our 'western' diet. Milk is acidic to the body...cancer feeds on acid. 
Calcium in milk is the wrong type for humans and is implicated in plaque 
forming inside the arteries...think heart disease. Acne is mostly caused by 
milk despite what Doctors say (try milk free for 4 weeks and see). Pus...yes 
pus, bacteria and hormones are rife in this white cocktail for calves. I could 
go on.<br>
<br>
 Also see &quot;The Milk Myth&quot; on saveourbones web site 
for another point of view. Good health to you all...milk free of course.</p>

<p>The truth is that Diethystilbesterol, a FEMALE HORMONE is injected into 
Beef and Dairy Cattle &quot;extensively,&quot; with some exceptions 
(Horizon's/Stonyfield) The Prostate/Breast Cancer statistics are indicative of 
the beef/milk connection, the path being, (a) women on the PILL, who excrete 
&quot;THEIR&quot; hormones along with (b)&quot;URINE&quot; from the Hormone 
laden Beef/Dairy &quot;CATTLE,&quot; into the &quot;SURFACE WATER&quot; which 
&quot;CANNOT&quot; be eliminated.(Popular Science). MALE FISH have been and ARE 
developing &quot;FEMALE CHARACTERISTICS.&quot; Young girls are also 
over-developed for their age category while keeping in mind that the human 
brain matures at 25. It is not difficult to deduct the problems associated with 
the industries who expose innocent Americans to the poisonous promulgation of a 
product that should be condemned.<br>

<p>Please, please, PLEASE tell me that you did not just publish, &quot;you can 
purchase antibiotic-free (and typically HORMONE-FREE, as well) milk...&quot; 
Regardless of whether or not r-BST is injected in any cow in this country, or 
world for that matter, you will NEVER know because r-BST is a hormone naturally 
created by the cow and it is undetectable. That said, all milk contains 
hormones! Just because it says it's organic doesn't make it hormone-free. Oh 
the hype... it's so sad how far removed the majority of people are from 
agriculture. If you're really so concerned about your intake, do a farm visit! 
Milk Production Services of Indiana hosts the event 'Brunch on the Farm' where 
they welcome the public to come and see for themselves how milk gets from the 
cow to the tank, to the jug/carton.<br>
 Please invest in yourself, educate 
yourself!<br>

<p>The China Study is a great book. Milk is nasty. I laugh at people at the 
grocery store who have it in their carts. The milk company spends 165 million a 
year to ensure your children will be life long consumers of milk. Milk is 
linked to diabetes, obesity, cancer, asthma, allergies, etc, etc. If you care 
about your health you should read &quot;The China Study&quot;</p>

<p>I always get a kick out of people stating what mother nature intended for 
us... Which, no one really knows 100%. See we can do this thing called 
reasoning much better than anything else on the planet. So yes just about 
everything else stops drinking milk, but we don't rely on instinct nearly as 
much. We over the years have adapted to drink milk into adulthood becuase we 
realize the use of milk as a source of nutrition. I'm sure there are things 
everywhere that we add to our environment that aren't good for us. For example, 
how many people even think about drinking out of plastic and what the plastic 
may give off? In the end, one of the best tests is using something for a long, 
long time and monitoring the side effects. As stated before, if there were any 
real seriouse side effects we would have seen them by now... Dean above is a 
prime example. I drink alot of milk, it's from a cow, it was made for baby cows 
whos parents I eat, I highly, HIGHLY, doubt there's anything bad about milk. 
Eating my nephews lucky charms is probobly worse for me... But hey, it's like 
water, you can drink too much of it too even though we are mostly water. Too 
much of a good thing can be bad. But milk, it is good. When I see negative 
effects related to milk, and some real proof behind them I'll change my mind. 
But I don't think that'll ever happen... In fact, I've kinda got an hankerin 
for it now...</p>

<p>The book &quot;The China Study&quot; is loosely based on a study that was 
conducted in the early '80s that came to be known as the China Project. The 
study relied heavily on recall questionnaires and many of the study's 
conclusions were derived from data, that was by the study's own admission, not 
statistically significant. &quot;The China Study's&quot; author, Dr.T. Colin 
Campbell's, passion for a vegetarian diet may not be motivated solely by 
vegetarianism's purported health benefits but also to Dr. Campbell's ties to 
PETA. Also, as I said before that the China project was conduct 30 years ago, 
knowledge and scientific methods in just about every field has evolved 
immensely in that time period. Just something to think about...</p>

<p>It's amazing how supposedly educated people can make comments like &quot;if 
milk was really unhealthy, we would have all types of health 
problems&quot;...well we do. Have you been listening? The Western diet is the 
cause of America leading the world in illnesses like heart disease, colon 
cancer,and various other cancers, diabetes, obesity, stroke...I could go on. We 
lead the world. With milk as a staple of this so called great diet, it does 
contribute to these illnesses. And for the 50 year old...wow it's great that 
you can drink all of that milk and be healthy. Good for you. But with that 
arguement, we could all smoke for most of our lives and live to 100 like George 
Burns. So smoking must not be bad for your health either? Wake up. Recognize 
exception for what it is and look at the big picture. We don't have this big 
health care controversy right in this country now because we are so healthy.</p>

nutritional advice as he clearly does not have his clients best intrest in mind 
when he publishes articles like this. you can either beleive the industry about 
how good milk is for you or go and research the countries where milk is 
consumed in greater quanties and analyse the data for osteoporosis, breast 
cancer, prostate cancer etc. funny how milk is promoted as being good for 
osteoporosis...and to say that there is no hormones in milk LOL not only is 
there hormones, there is also measureable amounts of blood and pus and there is 
a leaglly permitted amount so if there wasnt then they would not stipulate an 
acceptable amount... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell_count<br>
 this 
is not the first time i have seen misinformation in this publication, I begin 
to wonder if Men's Health is not owned by people with interest in meat and 
dairy industries...it should be called &quot;Men's Un-Health&quot;!</p>

<p>Alan Aragon from the BB.com forum? If you are the same guy that is pretty 
awesome. Good to see that there are some smart and successful people from there 
(unlike the Misc section). Great article!<br>
<br>
 I was worried when one of 
my profs at university tried to connect how there seems to be an increase in 
the amount of young boys growing exceptionally quickly today, when compared to 
the past. By the time they reach 11-13 years of age, they are already over 6' 
tall, which they think is &quot;unnatural&quot;. They then went on to suggest 
that it might just be from what we feed/give to our cattle (such as hormones), 
which directly goes into the milk that we drink. Well now I know that was a 
load of horsesh*t and they were just speaking out of their a55. They also 
happen to be an environmentalist, so I am not really surprised. At least they 
didn't preach to stop drinking milk, just to drink organic milk if you can 
afford it. They also mentioned that the 2 cups of milk a day recommendation is 
by milk producers, which is not endorsed by health agencies. Which is true as 
you don't need to drink milk to meet your dairy requirements, but due to the 
benefits of milk it would be good to include in your diet.<br>
<br>
 @Jay &amp; 
SL, GTFO! Alan is a respected and well educated member in the nutritional 
field. Not only that, but he conducts research and has articles published in 
peer reviewed journals. Look him up if you are in doubt of this writeup because 
there are no references.<br>
<br>
 @Zach, mucus drainage is an indicator of bad 
breath. I am more likely to believe that your 'stopped working out' had more to 
do with it disappearing than cutting out the milk. You probably did not consume 
enough water and gym atmospheres tend to have a cool air temperature, perfect 
for sinus drainage when not warmed up.<br>
<br>
 @Carlos Oliveira, LOL. 
Seriously, backing up your claims with wikipedia. GTFO of here you troll.<br>

<br> @Gary, you are right that America is an embarrassment to the world in 
terms of health because of the diet they have, but you can't just say it is 
because of milk. Fast foods, foods high in trans fat, not enough fruits and 
vegetables, processed meat, overuse of pesticides(?), no exercise,...etc. The 
result, a high obese society which causes an unhealthy nation and raises those 
so called illnesses you were talking about.<br>
<br>
 I can't read anymore 
comments, it is just painful to read what some people believe in. Also,<br>
<br>
 LOL at all the broscience and so called experts in this thread. People can be 
so easily manipulated/brainwashed into believing BS and will never believe 
anything else on the topic that isn't what they want to hear.</p>

<p>I am a surprised at the lack of evidence in this article at all. I mean the 
other side can show mountains of evidence that milk is very unhealthy. You will 
notice though that this ad is published in TONS of online journals, and is 
really similar to TV commericals about cows milk.<br>
<br>
 But here is a 
question: Why does the nation that promotes, produces, and consumes the most 
milk on planet Earth, have by far the highest rate of osteoporosis of any other 
nation?<br>
<br>
 Turns out what most people know about milk they got from TV 
commercials and national ad campaigns. The good news? It is not ever hard 
really to find the truth, if you really want to learn the truth and don't 
merely seek for your poor living to be confirmed with bad science and industry 
advertisements.</p>

<p>I went to the NotMilk site and am sick that we continue to buy into this 
&quot;does a body good&quot; marketing campaign. Not only is the Dairy Industry 
the largest in America, I believe that now our government IS the Dairy 
Industry. Fact is, humans are the only mammals who continue to drink milk past 
infancy, and IT'S NOT EVEN MILK FROM OUR OWN SPECIES! Would you drink dog milk, 
cat milk, rat milk? Horse milk, monkey milk, rabbit milk? No to all! And how 
grossed out would you be if you went into the store and they sold Human milk? 
Well this is what &quot;tradition&quot; and &quot;conditioning&quot; since 
childhood have done to all of us! We think it's okay to drink cow's milk, but 
not human milk! That pretty much sums up where we are as a society. A nation of 
sheep. If you think BGH has no effect on you, go look at girls in South America 
who are nowdays developing breasts at age 10. We're being fed a ration of lies 
from our government, the FDA, and the Dairy Industry, all in the name of 
profit. Get off the milk and live healthy, stop consuming everything the FDA 
says is healthy, people! It's the f'ing government! The ones who want to cut 
world population to half what it is currently. They want us to work until we're 
65 and then die at 66. Wake up!</p>

<p>If milk is that bad for your health then I should be dead 20 years ago. 
However I am still here typing this as healthy as a horse never went to 
hospital except when I was 8 to get my tonsils out. I think people should be 
more concerned about the cartel that doctors and pharmacies have going between 
them. They have the majority or people over 50 on tablets every day that they 
don't even need and are bad for their health. Tom this is more of a reason that 
people die in their 60's than drinking milk. If milk is as bad for your health 
as some people want you to believe then anybody that drinks it should be dead 
by 30 and if not they would have serious health problems. That is not the case 
however so it is safe to drink milk and it keeps you bones strong.</p>

<p>I can't be bothered with this debate anymore. I just want to be able to 
drink milk. I read on one article that milk actually makes your bones more 
likely to be fractured. RUBISH. I am still young but i play loads of sports and 
have got hurt many times but have never fractured of broken a bone in my body. 
Thank you for this article I can finally have my milk in peace.</p>

<p>:People are forgetting that milk is for babies who do not have their teeth 
yet. In nature baby stops drinking milk as soon as their tooth grows. Milk has 
very high concentration of nutrients that is necessary for the growth of 
baby.If you cotinue to drink at the same time eating regular amount of solid 
food you end up taking in too much of fat and colesterol That will cause many 
health problems such as heart attack, stroke and cancer...Besides why would you 
drink cow's milk ?....why not drink human milk ?...that is most suitable for us 
!!...If human milk is bottled nicely and available in super markets would you 
buy and drink ?...probably not... then why would you drink milk from other 
animals ???</p>

<p> Well I have been drinking MILK and I have been eating cheese since I was a 
little boy,and I am 51yrs old. I too have sinus problems, BUT! MILK does not 
bother my sinus problems, I have a physical done every year, and blood work 
done periodically and I have not been told that I have cancer, or anything else 
wrong with me. I think if Mens Health is going to tell us that MILK is bad fo 
us, then post where all of this supported documentation can be found at.<br>
 I 
am so tired of hearing that everything that we eat, or drink is bad for us. No 
one seems to be able to make up their minds as to what is good or what is bad 
for us Humans. Supposetly eggs were bad for your cholesterol, but hey I eat 
eggs everyday and my cholestrol is very good.<br>
 So when you people that want 
to say that something is bad for us to consume, PLEASE post all of your proof 
before you go and make these allegations. Next thing we are gonna be told is 
that it is not saf to breath the air, and that we should all carry around an 
oxygen bottle with us.</p>

<p>Ehm, it is this thing ... What would you do if your lady just gave her milk 
to cows? So, I don't think that milk is for us humans.<br>
 Calvs have to go up 
like 45 kg in one summer. When mum told me that It ringed a bell in my head 
that there is a reason that most humans are alergic for milk. Btw, They make 
soya milk which is just as good as cow milk., actually better, it even lasts 
longer so yeh.<br>
 I just belive that whatever cow or goat you want milk from, 
its not good for you. Oh, and there is a reason that cows make milk when the 
calvs are born, the same about humans, am I wrong?<br>
 They all say that milk 
makes the skeleton stronger, but vegetables does that, not milk, thats what Ive 
heard. Do what you all want, but I dont want milk from any animal in my Human 
body. :I</p>

<p>I was never much of a milk drinker growing up (still had some, I was raised 
in the midwest, so it was nearly impossible to avoid), and since I have went to 
college, graduated and moved on (playing multiple sports all the way through, 
mind you), I have never broken a bone. There is a good amount of calcium and 
other important nutrients in veggies like broccoli, kale, spinach, etc.<br>
<br>
 Also, not trying to sound all hippy-like here, bit does anyone ever think 
about the fact that we are stockpiling these cows in extremely unsanitary 
conditions, feeding them crap, with them lying and rolling around in their own 
crap, and then eating them and drinking what comes from there nasty infected 
utters? Think about how bad that is? Not only for us, but for the 
cows...extremely inhumane. Every animal deserves a free, long life...not to be 
stockpiled by us only to be eaten.<br>

 Off my high-horse now. Go eat some 
fruits and veggies folks!</p>

<p>Of course Americans are unhealthy but it's not because of milk. Milk is 
altered too much to be that good but when unaltered, it is one of the more 
nutritious foods. Americans are lazy and fat. Americans eat too much junk food; 
even a little junk food is bad. So don't attribute it to milk. And you nut who 
says genitically modified food is good should go bury your head in the sand 
because you are totally Wrong.<br>
 All -- be in good health.</p>

 I don't know if these are claims you've already 
refuted. You have an interesting set up of the article. Only two of the five 
subsections actually deal with things about milk that are unhealthy. Rather 
than restating aspects of milk that are healthy, you should debunk the ideas 
people publish that are detrimental to milk's image. In a world of innocent 
until proven guilty, maybe you should go through all the purported notions that 
make milk &quot;guilty&quot; and provide evidence against...then those who are 
trying to prove milk &quot;guilty&quot; won't have a leg to stand on....<br>
