<br>
<br> <b>Can you use artificial sweetener or lactose-free milk with kefir?<br>

<br></b>Milk kefir needs real calories to survive, being the lactose sugar 
found naturally in milk. Artificial<br>
sweeteners will not provide kefir with 
the calories or nutrients it needs to live. Lactose-free milk,<br>
such as 
Lactaid, contains the enzyme lactase to break the lactose sugars down into 
glucose and<br>
galactose. These are simpler sugars that are easily digestible. 
Since the milk still contains sugar,<br>
just in a different form, our 
hypothesis &nbsp;(since we haven't tested this ourselves yet) is that the milk
<br>grains may be able to survive off this, though it is not suggested. It's 
not even necessary because<br>
kefir grains act much in the same way as the 
lactase put into Lactaid and other brands of<br>
lactose-free milk (and that is 
why kefir is so well tolerated by lactose intolerant individuals!).<br>
<br>
<b>
Is it easy to switch to another brand or % of milk?<br>
<br>
</b>Grains usually 
have very little to no trouble adjusting to another type of milk of the same 
mammal -<br>
in other words, switching from cow whole milk to cow skim milk or 
simply to another brand is<br>
usually quite easy for the grains to do. There 
may be a small adjustment period, where you may<br>
notice the consistency 
fluctuating, but usually they switch over just fine with no help needed.<br>

Switching mammal to mammal (such as cow to goat) is usually almost just as well 
tolerated. It is<br>
more likely you will see an adjustment period of a couple 
days - week, but in most cases it is able<br>
to still properly ferment it into 
kefir that you can drink. If the grains are really struggling, you can try<br>

giving half of the milk its used to with half of the newer milk. In most cases 
you will see them<br>
happily adapt. As a side note goats milk kefir is known 
to be thinner, due to the structure of the milk<br>
(the smaller fats and 
proteins involved), and not the fault of the grains. Goats yogurt is thinner 
too,<br>
because of this.<br>
<br>
<b>Can you use kefir liquid as a starter 
(instead of the grains)?<br>
<br>
</b>Yes, kefir liquid contains billions of 
microscopic organisms that are effective at making a<br>
yogurt-like 
consistency out of milk when you stir in a tablespoon or two in a cup or two of 
milk and<br>
let sit out or in the fridge for 24 hours. It will dilute and get 
weaker each time, so its best to start with<br>
freshly made kefir (from kefir 
grains) each time for the freshest and safest ferment.<br>
<br>
<b>What about 
raw milk?<br>
<br>
</b>Kefir grains love and thrive on raw milk, be it cow or 
goat. Raw milk is really the optimal way to<br>
consume milk if you can find a 
reliable trusty-worthy local source. You will want to be sure that the<br>
cow 
is healthy and the owner is using sanitary methods to ensure your milk is safe. 
Besides the<br>
fact that it will most likely be coming from a cow that is not 
confined (thus less stress and other<br>
issues like growth hormones), raw milk 
is much healthier and some argue it tastes much better,<br>
too. It contains 
many more enzymes and natural healthy bacteria of its own, the proteins have not
<br>been cooked, and the fat has not been homogenized. These enzymes and 
bacteria are sensitive to<br>
heat and unfortunately destroyed during the 
pasturization process. Raw milk also has the cream<br>
which floats to the top 
and can be used to make butter, whip cream, cream cheese, sour cream,<br>
etc.! 
Homogenization is used in manufacturing to break up the fat globules until they 
are very fine<br>
and unable to separate and rise to the top. This process uses 
a forceful spinning motion to break<br>
the fat globules of milk by propelling 
them at high speeds against the sides of the container,<br>
bursting the 
globules into small pieces (like paint hitting a wall). How far pastuerization 
and<br>
homogenization affect our health is a hot topic of debate and subject 
of much current research. As<br>
far as we're concerned it only makes sense 
that milk in its natural form has more to offer and is<br>
sometimes better 
digested or tolerated. It also supports a more natural, sanitary and less<br>

stressful environment for the cow, the farmer and the world at large while 
promoting local foods<br>
and respect for and connection to the animals and 
their farms we consume from. We encourage<br>
you to read more about raw milk 
safety and FAQ's atRaw Milk Facts.<br>
<br>
<b>What milks or other liquids can 
you ferment with kefir grains?<br>
<br>
</b>Its possible to ferment all forms 
of mammalian milk (mare, goat, sheep, cow, buffalo, camel etc).<br>
Some people 
with cancer have even experimented fermenting human milk as a medicinal therapy.
<br>You can also try to ferment other non-milk mediums such as coconut milk, 
coconut water (also<br>
called juice), soy milk, rice milk, or almond milk. You 
can also convert them to be used in making<br>
water kefir with sugar and water 
or juice and water. In this case you will have to convert the grains<br>

gradually and keep some on back-up in case they fail to thrive. Kefir can also 
in a pinch be made<br>
from re-hydrated dry milk, or UHT (ultra-pastuerized) 
milk, though they are not the best options for<br>
continued grain health.<br>

<br><b>How can you convert milk grains to kefir other liquids such as coconut 
or soy?<br>
<br>
</b>Converting grains is a patient process of trial and error. 
It is best to mix the two mediums for<br>
awhile if possible, letting the 
grains get acquainted with the new liquid, while still having access to<br>

some of its familiar liquid (for example, if you usually ferment with cows milk 
and want to switch to<br>
soy, mix in half cows milk, half soy milk for a week 
or two). You can gradually taper the grains off of<br>
their previous medium 
and see if they continue to ferment and grow in their new one. Some grains<br>

will just refuse to grow, but will still produce a kefired product. This is ok, 
just make sure that you<br>
have some backup grains or even some that you are 
maintaining in a liquid that they do grow in. It<br>
is actually quite common 
for kefir grains to be able to produce a kefir, but are not able to grow and<br>
reproduce in it. It is also a good idea to sometimes 'refresh' your grains by 
giving them some good<br>
whole fat milk every month or so just to increase the 
likelihood that they will maintain their strength<br>
and health in their other 
liquid (though this is not always necessary - some people have had great<br>

success doing just purely soy etc - just watch your grains and adjust to their 
needs). If you need to<br>
have the other liquid (rather than milk) and your 
grains seem to struggle, you will mostly likely have<br>
to keep a 'mother 
source' in the milk, creating new healthy grains that you can continuously use 
in<br>
the new liquid and dispose of. This requires more work, but is an option 
if all else fails. You can<br>
also use kefir (from kefir fermented in milk) 
instead of grains to ferment other liquids. Simply put in<br>
about 10% kefir 
into the soy or other milk-alternative and let sit out for 12-24 hours at room
<br>temperature. There are enough bacteria and yeast within kefir itself to 
properly ferment. We do not<br>
recommend trying this with store-bought kefir, 
since it may not contain enough cultures to safely<br>
ferment at room 
temperature.<br>
<br>
<b>What can you do to encourage growth and proper 
fermenting in milk-alternatives?<br>
<br>
</b>Sometimes milk grains will take 
to another liquid, and sometimes they won't. If it looks like your<br>
grains 
need a little encouragement, there are a few options. You can include a couple 
more<br>
ingredients to help boost its health and growth, such as barley or 
rice malt extract (available from<br>
brewing stores and sites), or a sweetener 
such as raw cane sugar (Rapunzel makes a nice one)<br>
or some fresh fruit 
juice from an acidic fruit (such as grape juice, apple juice, lemon orange or 
lime<br>
juice, tropical juices such as pineapple, kiwi, mango or papaya). You 
can also go with just adding<br>
a little bit of milk (10%-50%) if that is not 
an issue. If the grains refuse to ferment in your<br>
milk-alternative, then it 
may be best to continue to ferment your grains in their native milk, and then
<br>simply take a spoonful or two of the finished kefir and add it to your 
milk-alternative. This finished<br>
kefir, even without the grains, is powerful 
enough to properly ferment. This way your grains<br>
themselves are never in 
contact with your other liquid, and continue to grow and thrive in their milk,
<br>while at the same time producing a starter you can use in the other liquid. 
This means there would<br>
be a minor amount of milk (5%-10%) in your 
milk-alternative kefir, but it is another option if that is<br>
not an issue.
<br><br>
<b>Can you add other things in with kefir while its fermenting?<br>

<br></b>Yes, but experiment carefully as some things may hinder or even harm 
the grains (some foods<br>
contain natural antibacterial properties, such as 
grapefruit). You can just as easily add the desired<br>
ingredients or flavors 
after you have strained the grains out, and then let the kefir sit for 12-48<br>
hours before consuming. Adding mangos, vanilla beans or raspberries are some of 
our favorite<br>
secondary ferment flavors!<br>
