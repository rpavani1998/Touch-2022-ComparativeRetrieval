<h1>Get Your Milk Moo-stache On!</h1> 
<p> by Laurie McPhail on August 25, 2010 in Organic Dairy </p> 
<p>Few foods are linked with so many soothing epithets &hellip; mother&rsquo;s 
milk, milk of human kindness, land of milk &amp; honey! And of course the ever 
famous milk mo0-stache.</p> 
<p>Though many think it a commodity, nothing could be further from the 
truth&hellip;<strong>the fresher and less processed the milk, the better it 
tastes</strong>.<strong> And our milk is fresh!! </strong>To quote Phyllis 
Diller:<strong> &ldquo;I asked the waiter, &lsquo;Is this milk fresh?&rsquo; He 
said, &lsquo;Lady, three hours ago it was grass&rsquo;!&rdquo;</strong> Okay, 
so maybe it isn&rsquo;t quite so fresh as that, but almost. And it brings me to 
my next point&hellip;<strong>happy cows make better milk! At Culinarium, we 
offer milk from Harmony Organic.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Harmony Organic</strong> is a group of local farmers dedicated to 
organic, sustainable agriculture who<strong> treat their cows with love and 
respect</strong>.&nbsp; The cows graze on lush pastures in season and exercise 
outdoors daily in winter.<strong>The taste of Harmony&rsquo;s milk changes 
slightly with the cows&rsquo; menu,</strong> especially when they are first out 
on grass in the spring. The<strong> high clover content</strong> of the natural 
diet enjoyed by organic herds is thought to be why organic milk has<strong>
higher levels of Omega 3</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>But at Culinarium what really excites us is taste</strong> &ndash; 
<strong>and it tastes great!</strong> Harmony uses<strong> minimum temperatures 
during pasteurization to preserve the &ldquo;fresh from the farm&rdquo; flavour
</strong>. And their milk is bottled in charming returnable glass bottles as 
<strong>glass doesn&rsquo;t alter the true taste of the milk</strong>. <strong>
Harmony Organic milk tastes fresher, sweeter and creamier</strong> than 
conventional brands and we invite you to come in and taste the difference 
yourself!<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>But it&rsquo;s not all about cow milk</strong>&hellip;<strong>for 
many folks goat milk is the milk of choice!</strong> It has a different makeup 
of proteins and fats than cow milk, and slightly lower levels of lactose, 
believed to make it more easily digestible and less allergenic.&nbsp; We have a 
limited supply of goat milk on the retail shelf but if you are an avid drinker 
we&rsquo;re happy to order some in for you<strong>,</strong> just give us a 
call to set up your regular order.<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>And what on earth is buttermilk, you ask?</strong> In times past, 
it was the<strong> liquid left over after churning butter from cream</strong>. 
Today, commercial products are made by adding special bacteria to low fat milk 
that gives it a slightly thickened texture and tangy flavour. You can easily
<strong>make your own buttermilk substitution </strong>by adding 1 tbsp of 
lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup milk and letting it stand for 5 
minutes.&nbsp;<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>MO&rsquo; BETTA BUTTAH!</strong></p> 
<p>Speaking of butter&hellip;<strong>we carry several butters for your 
spreadable, breadable pleasure&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Local Dairy</strong> crafts a tangy, cultured butter in small 
batches with cream from local dairies and cheese makers using a family recipe 
more than 3 generations old.&nbsp; Whipped for easy spreading, our customer 
Alisa tells us,<em> &ldquo;This stuff is fantastic&hellip;for breakfast this 
morning I had a bagel and three slices of bread! I&rsquo;m in big trouble 
&hellip;&rdquo;!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Stirling Creamery</strong>&lsquo;s unsalted butter was voted by 
Saveur Magazine as one of the world&rsquo;s top 30 butters but it is their 
Hastings Whey Butter, a dense, rich, salty butter made from the whey from 
cheese, that we find to be &ldquo;way better&rdquo;!</p> 
<p><strong>CULTURED COUSINS: YOGURT &amp; KEFIR</strong></p> 
<p>Both yogurt and kefir are made by fermenting milk with bacteria, but<strong>
 kefir is fermented with more and different bacteria</strong>, in addition to 
yeast, making it a bit fizzy (some call it<strong>the champagne of milk products
</strong>). Both contain beneficial microorganisms, probiotics and nutrients. 
<strong>We are happy to bring in Kefir for you &hellip; just ask!&gt;&gt;&gt; 
And we always have yummy yogurt!</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Pinehedge Farms</strong> <strong>Yogur</strong>t is made with 
active bacterial cultures and pure organic whole milk &ndash; no powdered milk 
solids, artificial flavouring, sweeteners or pectin here! They were<strong> 
Ontario&rsquo;s first certified organic yogurt maker</strong> and <strong>
practice biodynamic farming</strong>&hellip;a self sustaining system which 
emphasizes the integration &amp; well-being of crops and livestock.&nbsp;
<strong>Virtually everything is done on their own farm</strong> &ndash; they 
grow their own feed, milk their own cows, and make and bottle the yogurt.
<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>With so many choice ways to get your calcium, isn&rsquo;t it time 
to get</strong><em><strong> your</strong></em><strong> milk moo-stache on?
