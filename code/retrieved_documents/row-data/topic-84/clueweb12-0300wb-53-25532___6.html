Basic Information <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Goat is the common name for any of eight species of cloven-hoofed, horned 
mammals closely related to the sheep. The two differ in that the goat's tail is 
shorter and the hollow horns are long and directed upward, backward, and 
outward, while those of the sheep are spirally twisted. The male goats have 
beards, unlike sheep. Male goats also have a characteristic strong odour that 
is produced particularly during the rutting season. The female goat, or doe, 
which has smaller horns than the male, is often called a nanny goat. The young 
are called kids. The male goat is called buck, or, colloquially, billy goat.</p>
<p>The goat, along with sheep, were among the earliest domesticated animals. 
Goat remains have been found at early archaeological sites in western Asia 
which suggests that the domestication of goats was originally between 6000 and 
7000 B.C.</p> 
<p>Unlike sheep, their ancestry is fairly clear. The major contributor of 
modern goats is the Bezoar goat (C<em>apra aegagrus</em>) which is distributed 
from the mountains of Asia Minor across the Middle East to Sind. Also unlike 
sheep, goats easily revert to feral or wild condition given a chance, and 
populations of feral goats occur in many parts of the world. In the UK, feral 
goats are now being used as one of a variety of ways to manage vegetation and 
maintain habitats by browsing and grazing.</p> 
<p>The goat is used for meat, as a milk producer, and as a beast of burden. 
Many parts of the animal are economically valuable for a variety of purposes, 
such as the skins for leather and the pelts for rugs and robes. One variety of 
domestic goat, particularly important for its commercial value, is the<em>Angora
</em>. The most valuable <em>Angora</em> are covered, except for the face and 
the legs below the knees, with long, fine, silky hair called mohair. The 
qualities of mohair have made it a valuable product. The<em>Kashmir goat</em>, 
a small animal native to the Jammu and Kashmir region of India and Pakistan, is 
the source of fine wool cashmere.</p> 
<p>Goat's milk compares favourably in nutritive value with cow's milk. It 
contains smaller fat globules and as a consequence it is easier for some people 
to digest and does not require homogenisation. It is used extensively in making 
cheeses. Goat milk is also used to feed many other animals.</p> 
<p>The goat's tail is short, bare underneath and usually carried upright. 
Major scent glands are located around the horn base. They function in 
stimulating oestrus in male and female goats, improving conception. The goat 
odour is, however, a detriment to goat keeping and milk consumption if not 
properly controlled.</p> </blockquote> <br>
<br>
Scientific Classification <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Goats belong to the family Bovidae. Together with the Ibex they make up the 
genus<em>Capra</em>. The domestic goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) evolved from 
the Bezoar goat (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>), except for the Angora, Cashmere and 
Damascus types which evolved from the Markhor (<em>Capra falconeri</em>). </p>

less globally <br>

Goat Breeds <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Breeds are different types of livestock which man has produced, either 
directly by selective breeding for particular characteristics (e.g. for milk, 
meat, working animals or for general purpose) or indirectly by introducing them 
to new environments to which they have subsequently adapted. In the latter case 
it is most likely that there has also been some degree of direct selection, 
even if only for those individuals that appeared to survive better than others, 
were easier to handle, or that best fitted the herders' or socio-cultural 
requirements.</p> 
<p>There are several different ways to categorize sheep breeds. Although there 
may be considerable overlaps between categories, these include:</p> 
</blockquote> Commercial or Productive use: <br>
<br>

<p>There are four categories: meat, wool or hair, dairy and multi-purpose. 
Some goat breeds are dual-purpose (e.g. meat and wool). However, a majority of 
the current commercial breeds have been developed with one primary product in 
mind, e.g. dairy.<br>
<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Meat Breeds 
<p>Goat meat is produced from many goat breeds, including milk goats. Dairy 
goats must kid in order to give milk.&nbsp; Surplus goat kids are slaughtered 
and sold for meat. However, there are some breeds that have been selected 
specifically for meat production characteristics. Spanish and South African 
goats are best known for meat producing ability (e.g.the South African Boer Goat
), whilst Indian and Nubian derived goat breeds are dual-purpose meat and milk 
producers.<br>
<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Dairy breeds 
<p>All does that have produced kids should give milk, but some breeds give 
more than others, and selection processes have resulted in a number of breeds 
that are kept largely for milk produciton. Swiss goat breeds are the world's 
leaders in milk production.</p> 
<p>Goat milk casein and goat milk fat are more easily digested than that from 
cow milk. Goat milk is valued for the elderly, sick, babies, children with cow 
milk allergies, patients with ulcers, and even preferred for raising orphan 
foals or puppies. Fat globules in goat milk are smaller than in cow milk and 
remain dispersed longer. Goat milk is higher in vitamin A, niacin, choline and 
inositol than cow milk, but it is lower in vitamin B6, B12, C and carotenoids.
<br> <br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Fibre breeds The Turkish Angora, Asian Cashmere and 
the Russian Don goats are kept for mohair and cashmere wool production. Goats 
which produce fibre, e.g. Angora, are generally not as suitable for meat 
production. This is because they are small-framed and produce smaller litters 
than other goats. <br>
<br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Goats may also be differentiated on morphological characteristics, such as 
hair or horn type.</p> </blockquote> Horn types Goats may have horns of the 
scimitar or corkscrew types, or be genetically hornless. They may also be 
dehorned as kids.<br>
<br>
Hair types Can be short haired, long haired, have 
curled hair, are silky or coarse wooled. <br>
Ears Swiss and other European 
breeds have erect ears, while pendulous, drooping, large ears characterize 
Indian and Nubian goats. <br>
<br>

<p><br>
<em>Pashmina Goats, India, can produce high quality wool </em></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There are over 640 known breeds of goat, some of these now either extinct, 
or endangered (seeTable 1 in the discussion on Domestic Animal Diversity). The 
web site maintained by theBreeds of Livestock Project at Oklahoma State 
University currently provides descriptions of 102 varieties of goats.</p> 
</blockquote> <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Goat Breeds in use in Kenya </p> </blockquote> <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Meat Goats breeds</p> </blockquote> The main meat goat breeds include: 
Galla; East African; Boer and crosses of these three with local goats. The meat 
goats are mainly reared in the low potential areas. <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>Dairy Goats Breeds</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The dairy goat breeds in the country include: Toggenburg; Alpine; Saanen; 
Anglo-Nubian and crosses and upgrades of these four breeds with local breeds.
</p> 
<p> The number of pure-bred dairy goats in Kenya is very small. The majority 
of the dairy goats are crossbreeds and upgrades.</p> 
<p> The Toggenburg is the most popular dairy breed. It has performed well in 
terms of adaptability and milk yield. The Alpine has recently been introduced 
in some parts of Central Kenya, to help upgrade the local goats to dairy goats. 
The performance of the upgraded goats is being monitored. Although the Saanen 
is potentially a high milk yielder, its adaptability has been a problem. The 
Anglo-Nubian has also shown poor adaptability to local conditions.</p> <br>

Reproduction <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>As with sheep, many breeds of goats are seasonal breeders (see the 
discussion of seasonality and influence of photoperiod on breeding insheep). In 
northern temperate zones, goats breed normally from August to February. Nearer 
to the equator, goats come into oestrus throughout the year.</p> </blockquote>  
For more on the reproduction of goats, see the section on<br>
 
&quot;Reproductive Management of the Meat Goat&quot;,<br>

Produciton and Marketing Handbook. <br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p> <br>
Feeding and Nutrition <br>

<blockquote> Goats are able to survive on browse in situations where other 
livestock, cattle in particular and also sheep, cannot. Because of this ability 
to survive under harsh conditions, goats have been kept by man in numbers that 
are greater than some environments can sustain. &nbsp;  See the section on Tree 
Fodder <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The resulting over-grazing has destroyed many tree and woodland areas which 
was then blamed on the goats rather than man. This perception of goats as 
having a negative impact on the environment has caused widespread ecological 
and political concerns related to erosion and desertification. However, goats 
are also valued for precisely the same reasons - for example, browsing by goats 
can help to reduce bush encroachment in grazing areas dominated by cattle and 
sheep.</p> </blockquote> <br>

<blockquote> 
<p> This farmers booklet on rearing dairy goats was written and prepared by 
FARM Africa to aid farmers keep and maximally benefit from dairy goats. The 
booklet has been prepared using simple language that farmers can understand. 
Hence the efforts to avoid technical language. Writers share their project 
experiences with farmers.</p> 
<p> The growing demand for dairy goats within and outside Kenya has prompted 
us to prepare this booklet for farmers who may acquire goats from the FARM 
Africa project in Meru and need skills for rearing/keeping the goats.</p>
