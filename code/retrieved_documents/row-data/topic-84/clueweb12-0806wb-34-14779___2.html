 Milking 
Dairy Goats <br>
<br>

<p>On a worldwide basis, more people drink the milk of goats than any other 
single animal. A dairy doe should be milked in the same manner as a dairy cow, 
using good dairy hygiene. Does may be milked by hand or machine. The milk 
requires the same careful attention to cleanliness and cooling as any other 
milk.</p> <br>
Goat milk has a more easily digestible fat and protein content 
than cow milk. The increased digestibility of protein is of importance to 
infant diets (both human and animal), as well as to invalid and convalescent 
diets. Furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk 
which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn.<br>
<br>
Goat milk tends to have a better buffering quality, which is good for the 
treatment of ulcers.<br>
<br>
Goat milk can successfully replace cow milk in 
diets of those who are allergic to cow milk.<br>
<br>
The natural 
homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better 
than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product. It appears that when fat 
globules are forcibly broken up by mechanical means, it allows an enzyme 
associated with milk fat, known as xanthine oxidase to become free and 
penetrate the intestinal wall. Once xanthine oxidase gets through the 
intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it is capable of creating scar damage 
to the heart and arteries, which in turn may stimulate the body to release 
cholesterol into the blood in an attempt to lay a protective fatty material on 
the scarred areas. This can lead to arteriosclerosis.<br>
<br>
Many dairy 
goats, in their prime, average 6 to 8 pounds of milk daily (roughly 3 to 4 
quarts) during a ten-month lactation, giving more soon after freshening and 
gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation. The milk 
generally averages 3.5 percent butterfat. A doe may be expected to reach her 
heaviest production during her third or fourth lactation.
<h4>Products </h4>
<p>Goat milk is used for drinking, cooking and baking. It is used to make 
cheese, butter, ice cream, yogurt, candy, soap and other body products. Goat 
milk is whiter than whole cow milk. Butter and cheese made from goat milk are 
white, but may be colored during processing. Due to its small fat globules and 
soft small curd, products made with goat milk are smooth and cream-like. Goat 
milk is also naturally emulsified.<br>
<br>
<em>Chevre</em> is the French word 
for goat. Domestically, it is a generic term that applies to all goat cheeses, 
and more specifically the mild fresh cheeses.<br>
<br>
The three fatty acids 
which give goat products their distinctive flavor are capric, caprylic and 
caproic.</p> <br>
