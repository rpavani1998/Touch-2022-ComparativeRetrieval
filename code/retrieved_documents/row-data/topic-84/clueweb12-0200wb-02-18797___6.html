<h1>Goat Milk Cures</h1> 
<p>Updated: 01/29/2011</p> <br>

<p>&quot;Some goats are bred for milk, which can be drunk raw, although some 
people recommend pasteurization to reduce bacteria such as Staphylococcus 
aureus and Escherichia coli. If the strong-smelling buck is not separated from 
the does, his scent will affect the milk. Goat's milk is commonly processed 
into cheese, goat butter, ice cream, cajeta and other products.</p> 
<p>Goat's milk can replace sheep's milk or cow's milk in diets of those who 
are allergic. However, like cow's milk, goat's milk has lactose (sugar), and 
may cause gastrointestinal problems for individuals with lactose intolerance.
</p> 
<p>Goat's milk naturally has small fat globules, which means the cream remains 
suspended in the milk, instead of rising to the top, as in raw cow's milk; 
therefore, it does not need to be homogenized.&quot;</p>

our nine children were raised on it. I attribute their dentist-verified strong 
straight teeth to the goat milk they drank as children.<br>
<br>
Goat milk has 
small molecules, thus making it more easily digestible than cow milk. It is the 
closest nutritional alternative to mother's milk, if breastfeeding is not 
possible. Goat milk contains naturally occuring acidophilus (the good stuff in 
yogurt), which is greatly beneficial to a healthy digestive environment.<br>

<br>I know children plagued by continual ear infections who are free from those 
afflictions if they consistently consume goat milk. A woman who had received a 
diagnosis of osteoporosis successfully reversed the condition with two years of 
raw goat milk kefir added to her diet.<br>
<br>
rnOften, people who think they 
are lactose intolerant really are cow milk intolerant or can't consume the 
emulsifiers used in cow milk products. My adult brother couldn't tolerate 
pasteurized homogenized cow milk, but raw cow milk was fine. One of our 
children tested intolerant of goat milk. After three chiropractic treatments to 
desensitize her, she could again consume goat milk.<br>
<br>
Raw goat milk 
tastes much like raw cow milk, but with more body. Keeping goat milk cold 
prevents it from developing a strong flavor.&quot;</p>

&quot;Goat`s milk is definitely one of the most nutritional milk around. Goat`s 
milk have been used for centuries. Goat`s milk may help people who suffer from 
ulcers, tuberculosis, arthritis, rickets ,irritable bowels syndrome, 
nervousness, anorexia, hay fever and allergies and weak limbs! lt increases 
longevity and improve our immune system to prevent and fight disease. Goat`s 
milk is also a great treatment for leukemia patients. Goat`s milk is alkaline 
compared to cow`s milk, which is acidic and harmful to health.</p> 
<p>Goat`s milk is also effective for cases of exessive white blood cells where 
the patients suffer from frequently fever. Drink goat`s milk daily and you will 
be cured.This formula is from a monk. Children who are suffering from weak 
limbs and are unable to walk should try goat`s milk. Goat`s milk has 
strengthened one boy`s weak limbs and enable him to walk freely for the first 
time. Goat`s milk is truly an incredible milk. All are welcome to try this 
wonderful milk.&quot;</p>
