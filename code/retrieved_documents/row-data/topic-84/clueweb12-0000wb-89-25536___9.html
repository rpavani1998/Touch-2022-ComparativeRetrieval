<p><b>What is Pasteurization?</b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> Pasteurization is the sterilization of liquids such as milk, orange juice, 
wine, and beer, as well as cheese, to destroy disease-causing and other 
undesirable bacteria/organisms. The process is named for the French scientist 
Louis Pasteur, who discovered in the 1860s that undesired fermentation could be 
prevented in wine and beer by heating it to 135&deg;F (57&deg;C) for a few 
minutes. Milk is pasteurized by heating it to about 145&deg;F (63&deg;C) for 30 
min or by the &quot;flash method&quot; of heating to 160&deg;F (71&deg;C) for 
15 sec, followed by rapid cooling to below 50&deg;F (10&deg;C), at which 
temperature it is stored. In milk, after pasteurization, the harmless lactic 
acid bacteria survives, but if the milk is not kept cold, they multiply rapidly 
and cause it to turn sour.(1)</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Why is Raw milk better?</b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Pasteurization destroys enzymes, diminishes vitamin content, denatures 
fragile milk proteins, alters vitamin B12, and vitamin B6, kills beneficial 
bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth 
decay, colic in infants, growth problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis, 
heart disease and cancer.(2) </p> 
<p>Heat alters milk&#146;s amino acids lysine and tyrosine, making the whole 
complex of proteins less available; it promotes rancidity of unsaturated fatty 
acids and destruction of vitamins. Vitamin C loss in pasteurization usually 
exceeds 50%; loss of other water-soluble vitamins can run as high as 80%; the 
Wulzen or anti-stiffness factor is totally destroyed. Pasteurization alters 
milk&#146;s mineral components such as calcium, chlorine, magnesium, 
phosphorus, potassium, sodium and sulfur as well as many trace minerals, making 
them less available. There is some evidence that pasteurization alters lactose, 
making it more readily absorbable. This, and the fact that pasteurized milk 
puts an unnecessary strain on the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes, may 
explain why milk consumption in societies that drink pasteurized milk has been 
linked with diabetes.(3)</p> 
<p>Pasteurization destroys all the enzymes in milk -- in fact, the test for 
successful pasteurization is absence of enzymes. These enzymes help the body 
assimilate all bodybuilding factors, including calcium. That is why those who 
drink pasteurized milk may suffer, nevertheless, from osteoporosis. Lipase in 
raw milk helps the body digest and utilize butterfat.(3) </p> 
<p>Butterfat has a cortisone-like factor which is heat sensitive (destroyed by 
heat) that prevents stiffness in the joints. Raw Milk contains beneficial 
bacteria as well as lactic acids that allow these beneficial bacteria to 
implant in the intestines. Once heated, milk becomes rotten, with precipitated 
minerals that can&#146;t be absorbed (hence osteoporosis), with sugars that 
can&#146;t be digested (hence allergies), and with fats that are toxic. (4)</p> 
<p>Raw milk has been used as a therapy in folk medicine. It has been used in 
the pre-insulin days to treat diabetes, as well as eczema, intestinal worms, 
allergies, and arthritis, all for reasons which can be understood when we 
realize just what is in milk -- such as the cortisone - like factor for 
allergies and eczema.(4)</p> 
<p>My personal opinion is raw milk produces much better cheese... cheese with 
body and character. Pasteurized milk cheese can be flat.</p> 
<p>I believe the American public these days are way to obsessed with 
&quot;antibacterial&quot;. It's gotten to the point of being dangerous because 
some bacteria is good and necessary. People are turning themselves into 
&quot;bubble boys&quot; never being exposed to anything, hence, when they are 
exposed to a bad bacteria, they get very sick. People who are exposed the good 
and bad all the time in there lives build a resistance, and when exposed to a 
bad bacteria, their bodies have developed the antibodies to fight it off.</p> 
<p>I'm not saying raw milk has bad bacteria, actually it's the opposite. The 
milk has good bacteria which can fight off any dangerous or bad bacteria 
present in the milk or that may fall into the milk. If you pasteurize the milk, 
thus killing the good bacteria, then any bad bacteria that may manage to get 
into the milk will multiply and grow quickly, because pasteurized milk is the 
prefect medium for bacteria to grow and there is no longer any good bacteria 
present to fight the bad bacteria off. This is why milk from the store goes 
bad, turns lumpy and horrible, where raw milk (if it's around long enough) just 
naturally turns pleasantly sours and becomes like buttermilk.</p> 
<p>I use nothing but raw milk. I figure, why bother going to all the trouble 
of raising my own goats for milk and then ruining it by killing off all the 
good live things it contains and destroying the nutrients? If your goats are 
healthy and you follow sanitary procedure, there is nothing better for you than 
raw milk. If using raw milk, it must be handled correctly, everything must be 
sanitary and the animals that the milk comes from should all be healthy and 
happy.<br>

<p><b>What is Homogenization?</b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Homogenization is a mechanical process that breaks down butterfat globules 
so they do not rise to the top. Mechanically homogenized milk has been linked 
to heart disease.(2) </p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Info about goat milk: </b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Normal goat milk fat has a much higher concentration of so called medium 
chain fatty acids (MCT), caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic (33%) 
verses cow milk fat (17%), and lower in stearic and oleic (27%) lower than cow 
milk fat (45%) . Much documentation exists showing the uniquely beneficial 
effects of those MCT, medium chain fatty acids in various medical problems, 
disorders and diseases, such as those suffering from malabsorption syndromes 
chluria, steatorrhe, hyperlipoproteinemia intestinal resection, coronary 
bypass, premature infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, 
gallstones, angcontributeto general thriftiness of children.(5)</p> 
<p>Goat milk provides 13% more calcium, 25% more Vit B-6, 47% more Vit A, 134% 
more potassium and 350% more niacin than cow milk. Goat milk is higher in 
chloride, copper and manganese and none of the controversial bovine growth 
hormone (BGH)(5)</p> </blockquote>

</p>
<p><b>Lactose intolerance, allergies and goat milk:</b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> Goat milk, like cows milk and human milk, contain lactose, but many people 
(but not all) with lactose intolerance and cow milk allergies can drink goats 
milk. Why? It is because of goat milks superior digestibility. Goat milk is 
more completely and easily absorbed than cows milk leaving less residue behind 
in the colon where it can literally ferment and cause problems. The 
digestibility of goat milk can be attributed to it's casin curd, which is both 
softer and smaller, thus easy to digest. Another big difference between cow and 
goat milk is found that the average goat milk fat globule is about 1 1/2 to two 
microns compared to cow at 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 microns another factor in ease of 
digestion. Goat milk contains more essential fatty acids (linoleic &amp; 
archidoic acids) and higher proportion of short chain and medium chainfatty 
acids than cows milk. The fat can be more readily digested and absorbed because 
lipases attack ester linkages of these fatty acids more readily than those of 
longer chains (cow) And unlike cows milk, goat milk does not contain 
agglutinin; as a result the fat globules in goat milk do not cluster, again 
allowing the ease of digestion and absorption.(6) </p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>What about fat content?</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Not all fat is bad; there are &quot;good fats&quot; and &quot;bad 
fats&quot;. You need some fat in your diet, but you need to keep in mind that 
too much of anything (including a good thing) can be bad for you.</p> 
<p>Butterfat contains vitamins A and D needed for the assimilation of calcium 
and protein in the water fraction of the milk. Without them, protein and 
calcium are more difficult to utilize and possibly toxic. Butterfat is rich in 
short and medium chain fatty acids which protect against disease and stimulate 
the immune system. It contains glycospingolipids which prevent intestinal 
distress, and conjugated linoleic acid which has strong anticancer properties.
