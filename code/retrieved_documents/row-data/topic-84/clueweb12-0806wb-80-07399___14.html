 Children with autism improve 
dramatically with the SCD goat yogurt! Improvements are seen in 
digestion,speech and behavior. The yogurt making process changes the structure 
of the casein and renders it harmless. Most children do tolerate the goat 
yogurt if it done the right way by starting out with a tiny amount and 
gradually increasing the amount. There is no risk in trying since the casein 
leaves the body after several days.

<b> Parents' testimonials about the yogurt.</b><br>

<p> </p>  I have had my two boys on SCD for just about two years. My older 
child, 7, had an ASD diagnosis; he is now considered recovered although he 
still has some difficulties with attention and sound sensitivity. But he 
continues to get better, not worse, and I quit worrying about those elusive 
peptides a long time ago. My younger child, 5, is NT with some form of colitis 
that has been difficult to control. I added goat yogurt 21 months ago. Both 
boys have done fine on it, and about 18 months ago I added back cheese too. I 
think my younger son is still sensitive to cow products so I try to give my 
kids only goat-milk and sheep-milk cheese.
<p> What initially convinced me to try the goat-milk yogurt were several 
things:<br>
 1)there were some moms on the list with VERY sensitive kids, MUCH 
more sensitive than mine, and they reported their kids were doing fine with 
goat yogurt. There used to be a list-member named Jen Young, and her son Colin 
was so sensitive that he would bang his head if she used the wrong starter. 
Anyway, he did fine on goat-milk yogurt - in fact she said he could tolerate 
many more foods when he was eating yogurt.</p>
<p> (2)Dr. William Shaw gave a talk at an ACAM conference, and he discussed 
the fact that beta-casomorphine, which is probably the problem peptide, exists 
in some but not all cow milk and not at all in goat milk; and (3) there are a 
number of studies showing that probiotics are delivered much more effectively 
in fermented foods than in capsules.</p>
<p> My kids ate GFCF for 2 years before I put them on SCD, so I too was very 
nervous about giving them yogurt. But I got brave and tried it, and nothing bad 
happened! My yogurt maker runs most days of the week and my kids get a dish 
every day for breakfast. As I said, this has gone on for 21 months now.</p>

 More comments from Catherine Tamaro: 
<p> Here is something interesting about dairy: There is increasing evidence 
that the kids with autism are not methylating properly, and one of the effects 
is that they're not recycling homocysteine back into methionine. That means 
they're short on methionine, which is the building block for, among other 
things, glutathione. Yogurt is a great source of methionine.</p>
<p> Thus the GFCF people do even more harm by forbidding dairy - they leave 
the kids short of a very essential amino acid.</p>

 Comments by Jen Young: 
<p> Welcome. I was you in March of 2001. I had the same concerns and was 
trying to combine the GFCF and SCD for many months.<br>
 Let me tell you my son 
does horrible* on cow's milk of any kind. But I knew he needed the homemade 
yoghurt to heal. This is why I tried goat's milk and goat yogurt starter. And 
my son does WONDERFULLY on it--if it is pure goat yogurt (for starter) with 
nothing added but the three legal bacteria This yoghurt is different than the 
one you buy in the store---we cook or ferment it for 24 hours to get rid of 
most of the lactose.<br>
 I have never taken the peptide test. I am a bit 
suspicious and rebellious in some regards. My theory was that I didn't care 
WHAT was leaking necessarily--but wanted to fix the leak. I refused to do all 
the DAN/gfcf tests and when the holistic/natural healing path instead. The SCD 
is all we've used so far and my son is no longer autistic.<br>
 However, let me 
tell you--he made the best* progress on the diet when he was on the yoghurt. 
During the six months he was off (we lost our goat source) none of the 
probiotics adhered to his intestines and he had some rough times. The yoghurt 
is such a savior.<br>
 Best,<br>

<p> </p> <br>
 We too came to SCD dairy free. And full of casein fears. I 
learned that after 24 hours of fermentation that the casein is denatured.
<p> I am so glad that I put aside my fears of casein and dairy. After that 
first die off....using Elaine approved yogurt. Made with SCD safe starter. This 
is when we began to see the miracle happen with our ASD/celiac daughter...and 
all of us. She has a ways to go, but I will never fear the use of this yogurt 
again. SCD as outlined in the book is truly working to heal all of us.</p>

FAQ for Goat Yogurt.</b><br>
<br>
<br>

<p><b>When am I ready to start the yogurt?</b><br>
<br>
 When the initial die 
off reaction to SCD has subsided and things are stable so that you can gauge 
the reaction to the yogurt. Children with severe sensitivity to dairy might 
need to wait a few months before introducing the yogurt.</p> <br>
<b> What dose 
should I give?<b></b><br>
<br>
 For a child who is very sensitive to dairy,you 
should start out with less than a 1/8 of a teaspoon. There is a huge difference 
between a 1/8 of a teaspoon and a 1/4 of a teaspoon. Some children will not 
tolerate 1/4 of a teaspoon but will do fine with a 1/8 of a teaspoon. Try to 
remember that the yogurt is a powerful medication and should be introduced very 
gradually. Some children will not tolerate any amount. For those children it 
might be better to wait a few more months.</b> <br>

<p><b>Is it risky to try the goat yogurt?</b><br>
<br>
 The good news about 
goat milk yogurt is that it is not risky to try it as long as you start out 
with a small dose. If your child does not tolerate the goat yogurt, the bad 
reactions to the goat yogurt will disappear a week after discontinuing the 
yogurt. This is due to the fact that dairy peptides (from casein) leave the 
body in about 2-4 days.<br>
<br>
 DAN practitioner,Pam Ferro,also observed this 
phenomena with the children in her clinic.</p> <br>
<b>If my child's Gi 
problems do not resolve after a few months,can I try the yogurt?</b><br>
<br>
 
There has been a small number of children who did not improve with dairy free 
SCD and needed the yogurt to get gut/brain healing. <br>
<b>Is there die off 
reaction from the goat yogurt?</b><br>
<br>
 Sometimes,there is an initial bad 
reaction to the goat yogurt. If you get those reactions,proceed very slowly and 
decrease the amount of yogurt. If the initial bad reaction lasts more than a 
month,then discontinue the yogurt and try it at a later time. <br>

<p><b>What are the symptoms of a die off reaction to the yogurt?</b><br>
<br>
 
Runny nose, irritability, anger and worsening GI problems are some of the die 
off symptoms that have been reported after introducing the yogurt.<br>
<br>
 
The decision whether to continue depends on the individual case. a very runny 
nose is OK for a child who is doing a private at home ABA program but not OK 
for a young adult going for job interviews. Make sure that the die off reaction 
does not risk your child's health, monitor the situation vary carefully.</p> 
<br> <b> How long does the bad reaction last?</b><br>
<br>
 It usually stops 
after about a month but on rare occasions it may last for several months. <br>

<p><b>How can I distinguish between a die off reaction and intolerance to the 
yogurt?.</b><br>
<br>
Take some SCD goat yogurt and freeze it. Freezing will 
kill the beneficial probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Give your child a small 
amount of frozen yogurt - a dose equal to the amount of fresh yogurt that you 
are giving him. If your child tolerates it, then it is not the dairy that is 
bothering him but the probiotics inside the yogurt.<br>
<br>
 A die off 
reaction will bring quick improvements in speech and other neurological 
symptoms for a small child,as well as GI symptoms.<br>
<br>
 Observe carefully 
for GI improvements. Video your child,before and after to assess behavioral 
improvements.<br>
<br>
 If you have any problems please seek the help of a SCD 
counselor.</p> <br>

<p><b>Is Cow yogurt OK?</b><br>
<br>
 Cow yogurt is SCD legal for people who 
do not have autism nor cow milk allergy. We have heard that a small amount of 
children with ASD do tolerate it but many others do not. At this point we do 
not have enough information to recommend it. We advise caution.</p>
<p> Organic milk makes a more powerful yogurt.</p>
<p> </p> <br>

<p><b>What other strategies help to tolerate the yogurt?</b><br>
<br>
Some 
parents use the enzyme, Peptizide by Houston. One list member reported that she 
tolerated yogurt made with 2% goat milk better than the yogurt made from 
regular goat milk. Dripping the yogurt can make it more tolerable:</p>

<p><b>Yogurt and Oxalates</b><br>
 There is scientific proof that dairy lowers 
oxalate values and the risk of kidney stones. The SCD yogurt is a wonderful 
source of calcium and most of the children with autism can tolerate it after 
several months of SCD.<br>

<b>Goat vs. 
Cow Yogurt</b><br>
<br>
<b>Goat Milk Composition</b><br>
 (from 
www.dgc.co.nz/about.html)<br>
<br>
 For hundreds of years, goat milk has been 
regarded as the closest milk to human milk. While at the gross compositional 
level the amount of fat and protein is similar to that in cow milk, there are 
significant differences between the types of fat, protein and minor components 
present. When compared with cow milk, goat milk is considered to provide 
advantages due to the following factors:<br>

<ul> 
<li> The fat in goat milk is in smaller globules. Smaller fat globules provide 
a greater surface area for enzymes to break down the particles, enabling easier 
digestion. In addition, goat milk lacks 'agglutinin', a factor present in cow 
milk that makes fat globules in milk clump together.</li> 
<li> Goat milk fat contains a significantly greater proportion of short and 
medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) than cow milk fat, which contributes to more 
rapid digestion. Goat milk is higher in caproic (C6), caprylic (C8), capric 
(C10), which total 16% in goat milk (compared with 7% in cow milk). They have 
been used to treat malabsorption symptoms, intestinal disorders, premature 
infant feeding etc.</li> 
<li> Goat milk forms smaller, softer, more easily digested curds in the infant 
stomach, which eases the digestive process. Goat milk, due to absence or low 
levels of alpha-s1-casein, produces curds that are weaker and less firm than 
cow milk.</li> 
<li> Goat milk has better buffering capacity than cow milk at the 
pH-temperature conditions that exist in the stomach. This can be very useful 
for those with gastric ulcers. Goat milk contains bio-active factors such as 
insulin-like growth factor.</li> </ul> <b>The Process of Making Yogurt Changes 
the Casein</b><br>
 From Elaine Gottschall:<br>
<br>
 When we make yogurt and 
the pH falls to about 4.5 rather than 7.1-2 (as in fluid milk), the proteins 
are denatured which means that because of the acidity, the proteins lose their 
3 dimensional structure (sterochemistry) which would be the reason allergists 
worry about casein. In yogurt and in the natural cheeses, the casein is 
denatured into a two-dimensional structure which would be less likely to cause 
allergic reactions.<br>

<b>Making SCD&#153; Yogurt</b><br>
<br>
<b>Making yogurt in a 
Yogurt Maker</b><br>
<br>
 A dehydrator is the best machine for controlling the 
temperature of the yogurt. Other yogurt makers may overheat but this can be 
corrected with a light dimmer.<br>
Click here for information on how to use the 
light dimmer and for additional information on dehydrators. <br>

<p> 1.) Put one or two liters (quarts) of milk into a clean pot and heat 
slowly on a medium heat until the temperature reaches 180 degrees F.* Stir the 
milk from time to time to keep the bottom from scorching, and again before you 
take a final temp reading to make sure that the entire contents have reached 
180 degrees. The purpose in heating the milk to this temperature is to kill any 
bacteria that might be present and interfere with the yogurt making culture.<br>
<br> *Goat milk is delicate and should not be heated above 185 degrees F.<br>

<br> 2.) Turn the heat off and allow the milk to cool. The heated milk needs to 
be cooled to ROOM TEMPERATURE or below (as per Elaine's yogurt making 
instructions in BTVC). The range for room temperature is 20&#150;25 &deg;C 
(64-77 &deg;F). Stir well before determining the final temperature. You may 
cover the pot with a clean tea towel while it cools.<br>
<br>
 ( Pour the milk 
through a little sieve into the yogurt maker insert, to remove the film that 
forms on the top of the milk as it cools. You do not have to, but it will make 
for smoother yogurt.)<br>
<br>
 3.) Add 1/8 tsp (1 quart) or 1/4 tsp (2 quarts) 
ofProGurt yogurt starter from GI ProHealth to several tablespoons of the milk 
and mix it well until it seems well dissolved. Then add about half a cup more 
of the milk, mix well, and pour all of that back into the milk in the yogurt 
container. Again, mix it well. Put the lid onto the yogurt maker insert, making 
sure it is secure.<br>
<br>
 4.) Fill the outer container of the yogurt machine 
with warm water to the appropriate mark (i.e. for 1 liter or 2 liters or as 
instructed for individual cup yogurt makers.)<br>
<br>
Then, put the yogurt 
maker liner, containing your milk and yogurt culture into the machine - in some 
models, it may feel as if it is floating in the water slightly. This is fine. 
Put the top of the yogurt maker on, plug it in to ferment for at least 24 
hours. Some commercial yogurt makers may overheat, especially after 6-8 hours. 
If this occurs you can try venting the lid, turning off the yogurt maker until 
the temperature lowers and then turning it back on or placing the yogurt maker 
on a rack to prevent overheating.<br>
<br>
 5.) After at least 24 hours, unplug 
the machine and remove the inner container. Carefully, (remember - it's ALIVE), 
put the container into the fridge and let it rest for about 8 hours until it 
has cooled.<br>
<br>
 6.) Gently but thoroughly, stir the yogurt with a spoon 
or metal whisk to make it smooth. If you stir it too much it can separate, so 
remember to treat it gently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Making SCD Yogurt in the Oven</b>
<br> <br>
 Follow steps 1 and 2 for making yogurt in a yogurt maker.<br>
<br>
 
3.) In a separate bowl, place 1/8 tsp (1 quart) or 1/4 tsp (2 quarts) ofProGurt 
yogurt starter and slowly add some of the cooled milk, mixing it well with a 
whisk or electric hand mixer. When this solution is blended well, add it slowly 
back into the pot, again mixing it well.<br>
<br>
 4.) Place the covered pot in 
oven with a 60 watt light bulb on. Keep a thermometer in the oven and maintain 
the temperature at 100 to 110 degrees F. If the oven becomes too warm, use a 
pen to prop open the door just a bit. Once you have done this a few times, you 
will get a feel for how your oven best maintains this temperature. Ferment the 
yogurt this way for 24 hours.<br>
<br>
 5.) After 24 hours, remove the pot from 
the oven and put it in the fridge for about 8 hours. Do not disturb the yogurt 
until it is set up properly, or you will change the consistency.<br>
<br>
 6.) 
Gently but thoroughly, stir the yogurt with a spoon or metal whisk to make it 
smooth.<br>
<br>
 The cultures will remain active for about 2 weeks if properly 
refrigerated.<br>
<br>
 Details about cooling the milk to room temperature 
before adding yogurt starter:<br>
<br>
 1.Yogurt starter should be kept 
refrigerated or in freezer (as per your starter's instructions). If the 
bacteria in the yogurt starter are added at too high a temperature they can go 
into thermal shock and be damaged or die. Since we need to ferment the milk 
fully you want to start with a full batch of healthy, lively bacteria. When the 
milk is cooled to room temperature it allows them to gradually acclimatize to 
the temperature change. (It is similar to when you are adding a new pet fish to 
your fish tank. You place the bag with the fish in the tank to allow the water 
temperatures to even out and when they are the same you let the fish out of the 
bag.).<br>
<br>
 2. Some of the bacteria in the yogurt starters have fairly 
low, optimum growth ranges. Lactobacillus casei, one of the strains in Progurt, 
has a low temperature range. Cooling the milk to room temperature before adding 
this starter will allow the L. casei to do it's part in fermenting the milk 
into yogurt.<br>
<br>
 3. Commercial yogurt making and the usual recipes for 
making yogurt differ from the SCD 24-hour yogurt recipe. We need all of the 
bacteria to survive for the 24-hour period. Commercial and home yogurt recipes 
generally ferment the milk for only 4-8 hours. If they kill off some of the 
bacteria because of higher cool temperatures it won't matter, as they don't 
want a fully fermented yogurt (a fully fermented yogurt is more acidic and 
tart). They ferment the milk long enough for the milk to &quot;set up&quot; and 
if a few bacteria were killed initially they'd still have enough to cause 
coagulation (the gelling of the milk). For commercial makers of yogurt it saves 
them time and money to only cool to ~108&deg;F; it means they can produce many 
more batches of yogurt and make more money. The SCD yogurt takes longer but the 
24-hour fermentation period provides SCD yogurt with extremely high numbers of 
good bacteria.<br>
