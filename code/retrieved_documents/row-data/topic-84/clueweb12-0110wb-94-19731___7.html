<h1><b>How Goat's Milk Is Much Healthier Than Cow's Milk</b></h1> 
<p>Based on current research, listed below are some of the differences between 
goat and cow milk, which make goat milk generally the healthier choice:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>  Composition of Fat globules</b>: One of the more significant 
differences from cow milk is found in the composition and structure of fat in 
goat milk. The fat globules are 1/5th the size of those in cow's milk. These 
smaller sized fat globules provide a better dispersion, and a more homogeneous 
mixture of fat in the milk<br>
 &nbsp;</li> 
<li><b> Higher Amount of shorter-chain fatty acids</b> in the milk fat of 
goats:. Furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk 
which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn.<br>
 
&nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>  Alkalinity vs. Acidity</b>: The reaction of goat milk is alkaline, 
the same as Mother's milk.&nbsp; Cow milk produces an acid reaction. An acid 
environment promotes the growth of bacteria, fungi, and virus.<br>
 &nbsp;</li> 
<li><b> Goat milk protein is more easily digested than cow milk protein</b>: 
<ul> 
<li> The curd in goat milk is small and light, hence easily digested.&nbsp; 
The curd in cow milk is large and dense. Goat milk is 2% curd (which 
precipitates in the stomach) as compared with 10% curd in Cow milk.</li> 
<li> This difference in curd tension is attributed to the low levels of 
alpha-s1-casein in goat milk, compared to cow milk.&nbsp; This is a key reason 
why goat milk is considered more easily digestible than cow milk.A softer 
casein curd with smaller flakes could be expected to result in more rapid 
digestion of milk proteins, and this was confirmed in vitro by Jasinka 
(1995).&nbsp; Human casein was completely hydrolysed, compared with 96% of goat 
casein and 76-90% of cow casein. This was attributed to the greater level of 
beta-casein, and lower level of alpha-s1-casein, in human and goat milk 
casein.These results are not surprising when the impact of alpha-s1-casein is 
considered&nbsp;on cheese manufacture. A firmer curd is required for cheese 
manufacture in order to&nbsp;achieve desired consistency and yields, as with 
cow milk and its high level of alpha-s1-casein.&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;</li> </ul> 
</li> 
<li><b> Goat Milk Protein reduces the chances of contracting diabetes and 
other health problems:&nbsp;</b> Goat milk contains A2 Beta-Casein, not the A1 
Beta-Casein that cow&#146;s milk contains. Recent research published in 
February, 2003 has implicated the protein A1 beta-casein as a trigger for Type 
1 diabetes and other health issues (Elliott et al, 1999).&nbsp; Commercial 
efforts are now being made to select and farm cows which only contain A2 
beta-casein, which is considered the safe variant of beta-casein. Goat milk 
only contains the A2 variant of beta-casein, and is therefore a natural choice 
for those seeking to avoid A1 beta-casein<br>
 &nbsp;</li> 
<li><b> Natural Homogenization</b>: Goat milk is already homogenized: The 
natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much 
better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product. It appears that when 
fat globules are forcibly broken up by mechanical means, it allows an enzyme 
associated with milk fat, known as xanthine oxidase to become free and 
penetrate the intestinal wall. Once xanthine oxidase gets through the 
intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it is capable of creating scar damage 
to the heart and arteries, which in turn may stimulate the body to release 
cholesterol into the blood in an attempt to lay a protective fatty material on 
the scarred areas. This can lead to arteriosclerosis. It should be noted that 
this effect is not a problem with natural (unhomogenized) cow milk<br>
 &nbsp;
</li> 
<li><b> Superior micronutrient absorption</b> compared with cow milk. Aliaga 
et al (in a study in 2000) compared the influence of goat and cow milk on 
digestion and utilisation of calcium in rats. They found that goat milk 
enhanced calcium content of femure, sternum and Longissimus dorsi muscle over 
cow milk. In addition, they found a beneficial effect of goat milk on iron 
uptake. Similarly, Park et al (1986) showed that anemic rats fed goat milk had 
higher liver weights and efficiency of hemaglobin regeneration than those given 
cow milk, consistent with the greater bioavailability of iron in goat 
milk.Barrionuevo et al (2002) showed that goat milk increased the absorption 
and utilisation of both iron and copper. They suggested that the higher levels 
of MCT's (medium chain tricglycerides) in goat milk could account for the 
improved absorption of iron, and that the higher levels of amino acids cysteine 
and lysine could also be a factor<br>
