<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>MILK</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>A More Complete and Perfect Food Than Meat</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b> Milk is considered one of Nature's most perfect foods. It contains 
practically all the elements required by the economy of man to build bone, 
muscle, nerves, and brain; in sugar of milk are found the elements which 
furnish heat and energy sufficient to keep the human machine functioning. It is 
a far more complete food than meat. When meat is used as a basic food, it is 
necessary to combine with it other foods which contain the elements which meat 
does not have, such as the organic mineral elements, vitamins, and 
energy-creating material. It is also essential that fruits and vegetables be 
added to a meat diet in order that these may help eliminate the acids, toxins, 
and urates contained in the meats.</b></p> 
<p><b> Besides being an almost perfect food (lacking only in cellulose), milk 
is a remedial agent whose use alone has been the means of eliminating various 
ailments, particularly those caused by the toxins and acids with which the 
system has become filled by the use of too much meat and denatured foods.</b>
</p> 
<p><b> Milk contains the organic mineral elements and an abundance of the 
vitamins, both of which are essential to the normal health and growth of 
children; it is also the ideal basic diet for those who are suffering from 
&quot;deficiency&quot; or &quot;wasting&quot; diseases, but when prescribed for 
these ailments, the whole milk must be used as most of the vitamins are 
contained in the butterfat.</b></p> 
<p><b> Though a perfectly balanced food, milk alone is too concentrated to 
maintain health in grown people - cellulose is needed and eliminating agents; 
these are secured by the free use of vegetables, and of fruit between meals.</b>
</p> 
<p><b> THE ORGANIC MINERAL ELEMENTS: These elements, termed cell salts, are 
tissue builders, tissue preservers, creators of vital energy, stimulators of 
the ductless glands, and the preventors of disorganization and putrefaction, in 
much the same manner as ordinary table salt - chloride of sodium - preserves 
meats and other foods.</b></p> 
<p><b> These elements are found in abundance in many vegetables, grains, 
legumes, fruits, and nuts, but are contained in their richest state in cow's 
and goat's milk. In countries where milk is unobtainable, fish, natural rice, 
soy beans, millet, barley, cocoanuts, etc., may be substituted. Although these 
substitute foods are rich in organic mineral elements, they cannot take the 
place of milk as a child's food and this is the reason why the death rate is 
usually extremely high among children who are deprived of milk. In a quality of 
milk there is found nearly one per cent of the organic mineral elements per 
hundred weight, in the form of calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, 
etc., cell salts required for the normal functioning of the body. Deformity in 
a young child or animal, except when caused by accident, indicates that during 
the period of gestation the mother subsisted on food deficient in these vital 
elements, this lack preventing the unborn body from developing harmoniously.</b>
</p> 
<p><b> In the animal kingdom, the feeding of the female while with young, has 
almost reached a science, so that deformities seldom occur. There are of course 
exceptions and, setting aside accidents, these exceptions, despite the fact 
that the mother's food was rightly selected and combined, are due to the fact 
that the organic elements were not present in the food. This fault could be 
obviated if all feed were first analyzed.</b></p> 
<p><b> In the human kingdom, man is as yet unenlightened or refuses to believe 
that diet is of supreme importance to human welfare - he is far more concerned 
with the appearance and taste of what he eats than with its relation to health, 
normal development of the body, spirituality, success, and happiness; therefore 
there are being born an increasing number of deficient and deformed children 
whose parents, otherwise enlightened and cultured, are ready to blame any and 
every cause for the tragedy, except the right one: food.</b></p> 
<p><b> The organic mineral elements are rich in milk even when part or all of 
its cream has been removed, and in cases of weak bones, rickets, or 
non-development of the bony structure in children, a need for more than the 
usual amount of milk is indicated, and skim-milk is better than whole milk; 
when whole milk is give in large quantity in addition to other foods rich in 
fat, the system receives too much fat in proportion. Torpidity of the liver 
will result from this error, followed by indigestion, mal-assimilation, 
malnutrition, and other ailments thus offsetting all the benefit the milk can 
render. When milk is used as a basic food with but little else containing fat 
included in the diet (as, for example, a menu composed of milk, baked whole 
potatoes, or whole cereal bread with plenty of vegetables), then whole milk 
should be used. And right here enters a delicate and important dietetic 
question, one which frequently receives little or no attention and the result 
is that the science of diet has ben condemned. Too many who claim to understand 
dietetics, have made the mistake of prescribing whole milk in ample quantity 
and with other foods rich in fats, or of prescribing skim-milk without other 
basic foods rich in fat. In either case, results are disastrous, and the diet 
is condemned rather than the real cause - the food combinations.</b></p> 
<p><b> Very young children up to the age of two or three years, should be 
given entire fresh milk, reducing this whole milk with water to the strength 
desired. After that age, part of the butterfat may be removed and less water 
added - this, however, only in proportion as other foods containing fats are 
added to the skim-milk and vegetables.</b></p> 
<p><b> There is no food substance known which is in any way better for a 
growing child than plenty of fresh milk with vegetables of almost all 
varieties. To this combination there should be gradually added whole-grain 
breads with butter, and whole baked potatoes, though these two starches should 
not be served at one meal. Serve milk, bread and butter, and vegetables at one 
meal; milk, baked potatoes and vegetables at the next. These foods supply all 
the vital mineral elements, material for nerve and brain development; growth 
proceeds normally, and it is practically impossible for mental or physical 
weaknesses to develop.</b></p> 
<p><b> The ideal food for all normal children from the age of three to 
eighteen is in the various combinations of whole-grain bread in limited 
quantities, milk and butter, eggs and cheese, vegetables and fruits - all 
fruits being eaten between, never with, meals. Meat is unnecessary, 
undesirable, and to be included only when a need for stimulating food is 
indicated. Milk contains warmth and energy-creating material, protein and 
casein, which renew or build nerves and tissues, and the large percentage of 
cell salts vital for repair and equalization of the entire organism. Young 
animals fed on milk develop rapidly and normally, show strength and vitality; 
those fed on substitutes for milk, however perfect these substitutes appear to 
be, are usually more or less weak, sickly and in some manner undeveloped. 
However much we may dislike the idea and deny the fact, the human body is 
essentially an animal body and is governed by the one law which governs the 
growth of all the animal bodies.</b></p> 
<p><b> ALBUMEN: This is an important food element contained in milk. It is 
called the muscle-builder, as from it the muscles of men and animals are built 
and kept in repair. It is in milk in the form of protein. Albumen is found also 
in the white of eggs and if the eggs are fertilized, it is even more vital and 
concentrated, provided the eggs are fresh.</b></p> 
<p><b> Albumen, whether given to children, young animals, or grown people, 
should never be boiled. Heat coagulates it and may partly or totally destroy 
its value as a protein or albuminous food. A farmer who boiled or sterilized 
the milk intended for a calf would be adjudged more or less insane or wholly 
ignorant - not fit to be a farmer. An authority on this subject, H.N. Parker, 
has said: &quot;To obtain the required effect of pasteurizing, a temperature of 
142 degrees Fahrenheit is required, and it varies between 135 and 150 degrees. 
If the milk contained tuberculosis germs, I should expect some of them to 
survive the process. The albumen in the milk would probably be partly 
coagulated.&quot; In other words, according to this authority - and his 
statements have been widely accepted - pasteurizing at this degree of heat 
would not kill all the tuberculosis germs and would partly or wholly destroy 
the food value of the milk, and, unquestionably, of the vitamins therein as 
well. The process therefore is proved to be useless and destructive.</b></p> 
<p><b>SUGAR: Mothers who have fed their babies on bottle milk are more or less 
familiar with sugar of milk. This sugar is obtained from the milk of cows and 
goats, and not, as frequently supposed, from vegetables or chemicals through a 
process of refining. Sugar of milk is one of the most desirable of all the 
energy-producing agents, because, like whole milk, it does not long remain in 
the stomach but mixes readily with water and albumen, and the system quickly 
absorbs it. In this respect it is radically different from all manufactured 
sugars which are only partly absorbed and are actually, in most cases, treated 
in the system as foreign substances.</b></p> 
<p><b> Honey, though a sugar, cannot be considered in the same list with the 
various refined sugars but is to be classified with sugar of milk. Among other 
mineral products it contains sulfur which is not a part of sugar of milk to any 
perceptible degree. In the restoration of youth and the change of the 
intestinal flora, sugar of milk and whey are much more valuable than gland 
transplantation, although being common substances and easily obtainable, they 
are ignored and refused the consideration they deserve.</b></p> 
<p></p> <b>CASEIN</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>The Nerve and Brain Builder</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b> Because casein has been classified with albumen found in milk, it has 
been considered mainly as a muscle builder, whereas it is a most important 
nerve and brain-builder. If the American people could be induced to accept this 
one fact and give to common cottage cheese the place on their daily menus which 
it deserves, it would be the direct agency of making them probably fifty per 
cent more efficient, and the stigma of our country being a &quot;nation of 
neurasthenics&quot; would soon be removed.</b></p> 
<p><b> Casein in the form of cottage cheese is easily digested and quickly and 
perfectly assimilated. It repairs and builds tissue, stimulates the cells of 
the body to greater activity and acts as a natural tonic without stimulation; 
to the nerves and brain it is a food beyond compare. In neurasthenia, anemia, 
nervous irritation, the debility present in organic and inorganic diseases, 
malnutrition, nervous disease, tuberculosis, rickets, pellagra, as a basic food 
for most chronic invalids as well as for elderly people, casein is a 
food-medicine. It is found in skim-milk and fresh uncreamed milk. Casein easily 
replaces all other forms of protein and this is the reason for its great value 
as a fundamental constructive agent in the diseases mentioned. It must, of 
course, be well combined with vegetables as it is low in vitamins because of 
the withdrawal of butterfat, the vitamin carrier, and the whey in which is 
found most of the organic mineral elements.</b></p> 
<p><b>BUTTERFAT: The fat of milk is a compound of many substances and forms, 
on an average, four per cent of the milk, if cows have been correctly fed. It 
is rich in carbon and hydrogen. As an energy producer it furnishes more than 
twice as much to the ounce as does sugar of milk. It is a food of great value 
to children and adults not only because of its energy-producing power in 
concentrated and easily digested form, but also because it is the carrier of an 
animal or vitalized vitamin which is found in sufficient abundance in no other 
fat; vegetable and nut fats contain it to a slight degree.</b></p> 
<p><b> Butterfat is of greatest value when taken with milk before the cream 
has had time to separate itself. A chemical change takes place during this 
process, both in the milk and the cream, after which they no longer are the 
same as when they formed the primary natural mass. When milk and cream are 
separated and then remixed and given as a food, digestion is somewhat retarded, 
because the fat is then retained in the stomach with the casein, and the 
digestion is much slower. Due to this fact, it is best that fresh milk be 
served to children and invalids, and if it is still so fresh as to be warm from 
the cow, it is at its best for all cases in which vitality is extremely low. 
Babies and calves suckle warm milk from the mother's breast; Nature knows what 
is best for their normal development.</b></p> 
<p><b>MILK AND OTHER FATS: the difference between milk fat and other fats in 
their relation to the growth of the young and the health-controlling qualities 
in the case of adults, is due to the presence in the mild fat of a larger 
proportion of the elusive but active substances known as vitamins, as well as 
of a more abundant supply of organic mineral elements.</b></p> 
<p><b> Peanut oil, cocoa butter, and cocoanut oil, nut butters made from a 
combination of the fats of cocoanuts and other nuts, are valuable in the 
dietary. They are free from disease-creative constituents but are deficient in 
the important elements contained in milk fats and other fats, and become 
dangerous to health if wholly substituted for dairy butter in the dietary of 
children and invalids. These butter or fat substitutes, find their most 
important place when used in cooking and baking. Real butter should be served 
with breads, muffins, and potatoes. When it is impossible to obtain a 
sufficient amount of butterfat, the consequent shortage in vitamin and the 
organic mineral elements must be offset by the use of a greater amount of milk 
and a larger proportion of fresh vegetables and fruits; children should be 
served more tomato and fruit juices between meals. If milk and butter are 
entirely unobtainable, then animal fats and the richest kind of fish should be 
plentifully supplied as a basic food to old people, invalids, and even 
children; fish, especially, will help to make up the deficiency.</b></p> 
<p><b>MILK FOR THE HEALTHY: Many people have come to the conclusion that milk 
is valuable as a food only for the young, or as a food-medicine for invalids 
and those suffering from tuberculosis, anemia, neuritis, rheumatics, and for 
nervous wrecks and neurasthenics. This is erroneous. Milk is as valuable a 
basic food for the well as it is for the ill and on the family table readily 
takes the place of meat. As an example, let us consider the menu usually served 
for a family lunch: meat in some form, potato, bread and butter, a vegetable. 
The eaters would do well from every point of view if they would take instead: a 
glass or two of milk - instead of the meat, whole-grain bread, and butter, two 
or three vegetables. These combinations are identical with the meal based on 
meat save that the toxins and ureas found in meat are absent, and the meal more 
perfectly balanced. If soup is liked, a vegetable soup may be served first, and 
then the milk, potato or bread (not broth), and vegetables. The mistaken idea 
that milk is not solid or heavy for a basic food and that meat, being more 
substantial is needed, should be discarded. Milk, being coagulated by the 
digestive juices as a first process of digestion, is actually a more 
&quot;solid&quot; food than meat. The idea that milk is a &quot;light&quot; 
food is due to the fact that ignorance has always considered milk to be only a 
drink - a mere fluid - and not &quot;solid&quot; nourishment.</b></p> 
<p><b>MEAT SUBSTITUTES: From all that we have said the conclusion may be 
arrived at that it is always necessary to serve the whole milk if it is to be a 
complete substitute for meat. This is not entirely true. Skim-milk may readily 
and correctly be compared to the lean cuts of meat, while milk with all its 
cream is comparable to the richer cuts. The fat in milk is a more than 
desirable substitute for the fat in meat. On the other hand, skim-milk is a 
more than good substitute for lean meat because in it is found the organic 
mineral element which meat lacks. When skim-milk is used as a basic food, a fat 
must be supplied, but this is equally true when lean meats are served.</b></p> 
<p><b> It is not necessarily true that milk must be taken as a drink in order 
to substitute it for meat. Many soups may be prepared with milk as a base but 
care should be taken that the milk is added just before serving; if it boils, 
the albumen is coagulated and over-heating might also destroy the vitamin 
though it would have little or no effect on the organic mineral elements.</b>
</p> 
<p><b> When skim-milk is used as a food without the addition of butterfat, 
then about a tablespoonful of some substitute - cocoanut butter or cocoanut 
oil, nut butter or other vegetable fat - should be added to a cup of milk to 
make up the deficiency.</b></p> 
<p><b>CHEESE: Cheese is one of the most perfect substitutes for meat and if a 
fairly good grade is selected, it contains between one-sixth and one-fourth of 
its weight in fat, and more than one-third of its weight in vital casein. It is 
well to use frequently a good cheese in place of meat or other meat 
substitutes. And, since cheese contains a fairly large proportion of fat, it is 
not necessary that fat of any nature be added at a meal, with the exception of 
butter for the bread or potatoes that are served also. Bread and butter, cheese 
and several creamed or fresh vegetables, form an ideal meal, a perfect 
combination of foods for the brain or sedentary worker. Those who are engaged 
in more strenuous labor may require the addition of heavier foods.</b></p> 
<p><b>A DESIRABLE HOME PRODUCT: In country districts, the value of cottage 
cheese as a good food is well recognized and the wise housewife is certain to 
use all surplus skim-milk for its production. The skim-milk is allowed to sour 
or clabber and then heated to body temperature until it separates from the 
whey; it is drained, salted to taste, and softened with a little sweet milk or 
cream. It can be spread on bread in place of butter. Some add a good honey. 
This is a delicious combination and a splendid nerve builder. Children 
naturally prefer it to other foods and it should always be served in place of 
cake made from denatured flour, refined sugars, irritating spices. If this 
truth about cottage cheese were more generally known and observed, the United 
States would not be accursed as now with an average of four million defective 
children.</b></p> 
<p><b> Since cottage cheese contains about one-third pure casein, acid fruits 
should not be served with it. Acid, of whatever nature, affects the albumen and 
casein, destroying at least in part the nerve-and-brain-building qualities even 
though already coagulated in cottage cheese. This is true with all milk 
products. Many of the world's greatest physicians and chemists recognize and 
warn against combining acid fruits with preparations mostly composed of 
albumens and casein.</b></p> 
<p><b>BUTTERMILK: Many have the mistaken idea that buttermilk is not a food 
but a more or less refreshing &quot;drink.&quot; buttermilk differs but 
slightly from skim-milk. It has undergone a chemical change in which lactic 
acid is a product, and it contains a somewhat greater proportion of butterfat.
</b></p> 
<p><b> The casein content of the buttermilk does not vary greatly from that 
found in skim-milk; the amount of organic mineral elements is about the same; 
therefore, practically in all respects it is just as valuable as a food, is 
more readily accepted by some stomachs than skim-milk, and, due to the greater 
neutralizing qualities of the lactic acid not present in skim-milk, is more 
desirable in the treatment of some ailments. In malnutrition, tuberculosis, 
intestinal affectons and especially toxo-absorption, if skim-milk is not easily 
accepted by the digestive organism, buttermilk is the ideal food-drink.</b></p> 
<p><b> Buttermilk is frequently of great benefit to invalids, elderly people 
and children above the age of six months. It should be served between meals or 
as a meal in combination with baked potatoes of whole-grain bread and fresh 
vegetables. (When given to children of tender age, the baby's bottle should be 
thoroughly cleansed after its use, so as to avoid all possibility of souring 
the fresh milk at the next feeding.)</b></p> 
<p><b>WHEY: By-product of cottage cheese. When correctly used, it quickly 
changes the intestinal flora, destroys noxious germ life in the intestinal 
canal, and is abundantly supplied with mineral elements.</b></p> 
<p><b>FOOD VALUE: One quart of fresh milk containing all its native butterfat, 
is equal in food value to any one of the following:</b></p> 
<p><b> Three-fourths pound of beef<br>
 One-half to three-fourths pound of fowl
<br> One-half pound of nuts<br>
 One pound of peas, beans , or lentils</b></p> 
<p><b> It is to be noted that the food-value difference in beef and fowl 
cannot be precisely estimated since they lack the organic mineral elements and 
vitamins. Eggs, peas, beans and lentils contain these elements but they are not 
as easily digested not as readily assimilated. The vital value of a quart of 
good milk may be estimated to equal that of one pound of the best beef.</b></p> 
<p></p> <b>COTTAGE CHEESE</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b> As already stated, cottage cheese is almost a pure casein and is rich 
in all the essential elements such as the organic mineral elements and 
vitamins. It contains no toxins or ureas. It is a blood, nerve and 
muscle-builder, and regulator of bodily functions. One pound of cottage cheese 
is equal to one pound of beef, pork, lamb, veal, game, or fowl. Fat is absent 
but this is readily supplied by additional butter or cream, or in soups served 
with it. Cottage cheese costs less than one-half the price charged for meats 
and, considering its food value, would be cheap if three or four times the 
price of meat were charged for it. There is not one objection to it as a food 
for everyone, beginning with the child of ten months or a year to the very aged.
</b></p> 
<p></p> <b>MILK AND THE IDIOSYNCRACIES OF SOME CHILDREN(1)</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b> -----------------------------------------------------<br>
 (1) Many 
so-called milk idiosyncracies are due to the body's lack of lactase to digest 
lactose (the sugar of milk). Lactase can now be obtained from a Natrura 
physician for those with this problem.<br>
 
-----------------------------------------------------</b></p> 
<p><b> FOR EXAMPLE: &quot;I know of a child about one year old who seems to be 
poisoned whenever she takes cow's milk. A rash breaks out on her body, with 
itching, and she has gone into convulsions, even when milk was modified 
according to the prescribed formula.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b> Despite the fact that there are occasional individual idiosyncracies 
like the above, milk is the natural food for babies and children. When mother's 
milk, which of course is best, is unavailable, goat's milk should be 
substituted; failing this, cow's is the next best. Whenever there is an 
indication that such substitution for mother's milk may cause trouble, care 
should be exercised to secure good milk from one goat or cow and use none but 
that.</b></p> 
<p><b> At first glance, the above case may appear to be unusual but it is not 
- usually one or more such instances are met by every physician who treats 
children. The condition is not unknown in adults. Unless one has had experience 
with these cases, the conclusion is apt to be that the milk is a poison - or 
acts as such - and should be discarded. The real cause is seldom found in the 
milk, though occasionally a stomach is found which will not tolerate it and in 
which toleration cannot be established.</b></p> 
<p><b>Milk is a sub-acid food and if the system is in a sub-acid state then it 
is not acceptable and may not even be coagulated in the usual manner by the 
digestive juices, the digestion being so long delayed that it becomes almost 
like a poison. To overcome this, it is only necessary that a drink prepared 
from the juice of grapefruit or tomatoes - not oranges - be taken one-half hour 
before the milk, then the digestive juices will be prepared for it and it will 
be readily coagulated and digested.</b></p> 
<p><b> In the majority of case, the system is super-acid and the degree of 
reaction is in proportion to the acidity. Sometimes the milk at first induces a 
feverish condition followed by a rash, and if its use is continued the symptoms 
are aggravated. At this point, the average person concludes that the milk is 
not a good food and discontinues its use. A physician who has had experience 
will know that instead of being a poison, the milk is actually acting 
beneficially for the patient. The symptoms of poisoning and fever with raising 
of temperature even to 103 degrees, indicate the normal action of the milk in 
neutralizing the bodily acids and toxins, eliminating the poisons which had 
resulted from this neutralization, and equalizing the vital forces. Therefore, 
if the milk is wisely continued for a sufficient length of time, the symptoms 
will gradually subside, rash disappear, temperature go to normal, and it will 
be found that toleration has been established. This is what took place: When 
first imbibed, because of the condition of the system, as stated, the milk was 
an opposing force. The acid present caused too rapid coagulation with 
excessively large lumps of curd; and this condition may be so severe as to 
cause gas and the distension of the stomach, which in turn induces fever and 
convulsions. As the milk is continued, it gradually counteracts the acid, 
establishing balance. However, it is not necessary that milk taken into a 
super-acid system induce this condition. A test may be made and the exact state 
of the system known. When super-acidity is indicated, a sub-acid fruit such as 
orange of pineapple, eaten half an hour previous to the milk, will in part 
counteract the extreme acidity. For children, the usual procedure is to give 
lime water directly or add it to the milk. The theory is the same.</b></p> 
<p><b> The test referred to above is readily made by the use of litmus paper, 
first using the blue for saliva and urine. If the paper turns a decided red, 
acidity is present. In the case of a child, we proceed to reduce whole milk to 
almost the strength indicated by age and general condition, adding one or more 
tablespoons of lime water without the milk and an hour afterwards feed milk and 
lime water. Should the stomach still reject the milk, prepare barley water and 
to this add lime water and feed as usual. Then one-half hour before the next 
feeding give the lime water and when it is time for feeding, give the milk and 
lime water, This method, plus a little patience and common sense, will overcome 
the worst case.</b></p> 
<p><b> When children of one or more years of age cannot take milk, the 
procedure is more simple, fruit juices being used in the same manner as for 
adults.</b></p> 
<p><b> When there is no acid-reaction, the test should be made for 
sub-acidity. If this is indicated, a few drops of grapefruit, lemon or lime 
juice may be given in water half an hour before feeding time, then followed by 
the milk. Baked sour apples, tart berry juice, or the juice of other tart fruit 
may be used.</b></p> 
<p><b> In some cases of milk intoleration the action of the liver may be at 
fault, being either sluggish or over-active. Whatever the cause, it must be 
found, removed or neutralized, and this being done there will be few cases of 
intoleration.<br>
