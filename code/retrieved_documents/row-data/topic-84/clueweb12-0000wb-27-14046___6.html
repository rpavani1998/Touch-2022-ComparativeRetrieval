<p>Cheese Making, Milk, Dairy Home Page</p> 
<p>The information on this site is intended to aid the home cheesemaker in 
learning simple, inexpensive, methods for making quality cheeses and dairy 
products for home use. </p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  The information here covers making cheese and other dairy product with 
goat and/or cow milk. I, personally, use raw goat milk for all my cheeses, but 
most of my techniques and recipes were originally developed using raw Jersey 
cow milk. </p> 
<p><b> </b>We encourage you to break your link from Factory Farmed dairy 
products. You CAN make your own at home with milk from humanely treated 
animals, either raised by you, or a small farm which practices humane treatment.

<p>  Please note: I am a home cheesemaker and produce my own dairy products 
for personal use only. I do not run a professional or licensed dairy and I do 
not sell my cheeses or any other dairy products. If you are looking for info on 
cheese classes, where to buy cheese, setting up a small dairy, etc., please 
visitThe Hometown Creamery Revival web site. <b> </b> </p>
