<p>Sheep Milk: A High Quality Product <br>
<br>
</p> <br>
 Sheep milk is 
highly nutritious, richer in vitamins A, B, and E, calcium, phosphorus, 
potassium, and magnesium than cow milk. It contains a higher portion of short 
and medium chain fatty acids, which have recognized health benefits. For 
example, short-chain fatty acids have little effect on cholesterol in humans 
and make milk easier to digest. Abstract <br>

<p>Reasons for sheep dairying in comparison to cow and goat dairying are 
presented in an extensive literature review. The cost of producing 1 kg sheep 
cheese, the main product in sheep dairying, is about $8.- compared to $5.- for 
goat cheese and $3.- for the same cheese made from cow milk. Net income from 
sheep milk production can be presently at least double per farm than that from 
wool and meat production. However, research emphasis worldwide has been on 
sheep wool and meat production and their characteristics, not on sheep milk. At 
least two dozen different dairy sheep breeds are recognized, mainly in the 
Mediterranean area, with different genetic milk yield merits, but all 
distinguished by higher milk fat and protein levels than in goat and cow milk. 
Some sheep milk protein polymorphisms and their relationships to different 
cheese making parameters have been identified. Sheep milk composition can also 
be influenced by different feeds, grazing systems and by subclinical mastitic 
conditions. The fatty acid composition in sheep milk is easily altered by 
different feed supplements. Average composition of milk from sheep, goats, cows 
and humans is comprehensively documented and compared relatively to the 
nutrient supply from human milk and to the recommended human daily dietary 
allowances. The unique richness in short chain and medium chain fatty acids in 
sheep milk, sheep cheeses, sheep butter (so far very neglected commercially), 
and their special values in human health and as treatment for many disease 
conditions is discussed extensively. This can lead to sheep dairying alongside 
the cow milk industry as a unique and justified niche industry in many 
countries with considerable growth potential, that has been estimated in 
England alone to be worth more than US $100 million.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3> 
<p>Why milk sheep or even goats, when cows give much more milk and require 
less maintenance and labour per animal unit? That is a serious question often 
heard among economists. It is true that a unit of milk is more costly produced 
from sheep, also from goats, than from cows. Therefore, dairy products like 
cheeses, the main form of sale of sheep milk in most countries, are more 
expensive for consumers than cow milk products, e.g. cow milk cheese (
Table&nbsp;1), provided the sheep milk producer wants to not go bankrupt and 
out of business after a few years of hard toil, but actually make a living for 
his family, and some profit. On the other hand, milk is presently a better 
avenue to make a living in many parts of the sheep world (Table&nbsp;2), since 
wool has a poor market return, and sheep meat, mutton and lambs is in a tight 
profit position except for ethnic markets.</p> 
<p>Thus, why milk sheep? Is it because it is a better alternative to wool and 
meat sheep farming, or is it an alternative to cow dairying, which has had 
times of uncontrolled surplus production, quota restrictions, and cow milk 
intolerance problems, which the medical research community has not adequately 
addressed?</p>
<p>But how to justify milk sheep economically? Just because sheep milk has a 
higher solids content than cow and goat milk, and therefore has a much better 
cheese yield? That is not necessarily a good enough reason for the general 
negative economics of scale. Actually, buffalo (16.9%), reindeer (36.7%) and 
yak (17.9%) milk have at least the same high solids contents (Path, 1995; Kon 
and Cowie, 1961) as sheep milk for superior cheese yield compared to cow milk 
(12.6%), and they would have the economics of scale advantage as cows do. 
However, the large population size of sheep breeds, their wide adaptability to 
climates and forages make sheep much more widely accepted and genetically of 
greater potential.</p> 
<h3>2. Research publications</h3> 
<p>What other reasons for milking sheep can be found, than the addiction of 
the sheep farmer to nothing but sheep? Matching sheep milk products to the 
consumer is probably the best reason for milking sheep. The Commonwealth 
Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) considered the British Sheep Dairy News worthy for 
regular inclusion in their world wide computer scientific journal abstract 
service.</p> 
<p>Searching the CAB for the past 10 years, the numbers of publications world 
wide on sheep milk, sheep cheese and allergies related to sheep milk are minor 
compared to those on cow milk (Table&nbsp;3). Certainly there are more 
publications in earlier years, but those would be based on less sophisticated 
analytical methods. Publications on the nutritional value of sheep milk often 
give only gross composition without detailed identification of more specific 
unique components of benefit in human nutrition, although trade magazines 
contain many anecdotal reports, that are waiting for scientific evaluation. 
However, among the about 1,000 research projects on sheep world wide (
Table&nbsp;3), less than 4% deal with topics of sheep milk and sheep dairying.
</p> 
<p>Most textbooks on &quot;Milk&quot; deal only with cow milk, and human milk 
to some extend (Kon and Cowie, 1961; Falconer, 1971; Renner, 1982; Gravert, 
1983). The only major sources of research information on sheep milk appear to 
be the bulletins and proceedings of the International Dairy Federation Seminars 
held in Greece in 1985 and 1995 (IDF, 1983; 1986; 1996). Not even the 1st World 
Congress of Dairy Products in Human Health and Nutrition (Serrano Rios, 1994) 
recognised the existence or contribution of sheep milk products to human 
nutrition, nor does the handbook of the US Sheep Industry Development Program 
(Scott, 1986). In France, the scientific journal Le Lait devoted an entire 
issue to goat milk, including its role as an alternative to cow milk (Le Lait, 
1993). A bibliography on goat milk (Freund, 2000), and the proceedings of a 
national colloquium on the nutritional and dietetic qualities of goat milk 
(Freund, 1996) have been published, but similar efforts on sheep milk are still 
missing. Even a book on buffalo milk is available (Deepak Sahai, 1996).</p> 3. 
Effects of breeds, season, feeds, mastitis 
<p>Among the more than 25 recognised dairy sheep breeds, which are mostly in 
the Mediterranean region, great genetic variation exists in milk composition, 
lactation length, lactation yield and seasonality of milk production. Using 
artificially controlled photoperiods of daylight can change milk production by 
25-38% with concomitant changes in fat and total solids contents (Bocquier et 
al., 1997). Milk yields can differ more than ten times between breeds and 
within breeds, and lactation lengths can vary by 100%, which is a considerable 
potential for genetic selection and improvement. Even normal sheep milk 
composition may differ between 6 and 9% for fat, 4 and 7% for protein, 17 and 
21% for total solids, 4 and 6% for lactose (Table&nbsp;4) (Dario et al., 1995; 
Margetin, 1996; Simos et al., 1996), making sheep milk the composition leader 
next to reindeer among the 8 farm species, that produce milk for man (Path, 
1995; Renner, 1982).</p> 
<p>Genetic differences in milk protein polymorphisms are of great interest to 
the cheese maker, because of correlations to curd firmness, coagulation time, 
casein content and cheese yield. Many studies on cow and goat milk proteins 
have shown that genetic selection for polymorphisms can have advantages for 
cheese processing, but much less is known for sheep milk. New analytical 
techniques during the last 5 years have made identifications of sheep milk 
protein polymorphisms possible (Pirisi et al., 1999b). Sheep milk protein 
comprises caseins, and the whey proteins beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, 
serum albumin, and immunoglobulin mainly. The caseins comprise 4 main 
fractions, alpha s-1, alpha s-2, beta and kappa, and each has a number of 
genetic polymorphs, which are due to different phosphorylation levels, amino 
acid substitutions, glycosylation differences, alterations in electrical 
charge, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity of the proteins. The hetrogeneity 
of alpha s-1 casein polymorphisms in sheep milk consists of either A, B, C, D, 
E, or F genes (Pirisi et al., 1999b), contributed by each parent. The D gene 
has a frequency of &lt;0.01 in Lacaune, but 0.03 in Sarda sheep, and may be 
associated with low levels of fat, total protein, casein and poor curd forming 
characteristics. CC sheep milk had higher casein content by 3.5% than CD, and 
by 8.6% than DD milk (Table&nbsp;5). CC milk also had higher protein : fat 
ratio, smaller casein micelle diameter, and better renneting properties. Three 
genetic polymorphisms of beta-lactoglobulin, A, B, and C, in sheep milk have 
been reported, and homozygous AA had higher cheese yield and fat contents than 
AB or BB (Pirisi et al., 1999a). Kappa casein has A and B variants, alpha s-2 
casein 3 variants A, B, and C, and beta casein has 3 variants, beta-1, 2, and 3 
(Martin and Addeo, 1996).</p> 
<p>Milk composition during the lactation follows typical curves. Therefore 
tables of average milk composition of any species do not tell the whole story, 
since fat, protein and ash contents increase considerably towards the end of 
lactation, while lactose contents decrease (Casoli et al., 1989; Fenyvessy et 
al., 1991; Dario et al., 1995; IDF, 1996; Ploumi et al., 1996). This influences 
the taste of milk, as it may be more salty at the end of lactation, and also 
affects cheese making characteristics (Piredda et al., 1996; Perea et al., 
2000).</p> 
<p>Milk composition of major and minor components is affected by feeding 
regimes, ration components and forage : grain ratios (Perea et al., 2000). 
Supplementation of a mixed ration of rye grass pasture, vetch-oats and alfalfa 
hay with 20% calcium soaps of palm oil fatty acids increased milk fat content 
by 23%, yield by 16%, in milk of Manchega ewes, but decreased milk protein 
content by 9%; while 30 or 45% rumen undegradable protein had little effect on 
milk composition (Table&nbsp;6) (Casals et al., 1999).</p> 
<p>Milk fatty acid composition is of particular interest to consumers with 
concern of health and heart disease. Studies aiming to modify the fatty acid 
profile of milk lipids have shown that type of diet will be effective. Adding 
supplementary rumen protected fat can increase the proportion of unsaturated 
fatty acids in sheep milk. Adding supplementary rumen protected methionine and 
lysine increased the levels of Cl6:0-Cl8:3 by 5%, the unsaturated : saturated 
fatty acid ratio by 4%, but reduced C4:0-C12:0 by 12%, and left C12:0-C16:0 
unchanged in milk of Comisana ewes (Table&nbsp;7) (Sevi et al., 1998). Feeding 
ammonia treated olive tree leaves to Karagouniko ewes also decreased C6:0-C6:1, 
while increasing C18:0-C18:l fatty acids (Fegeros et al., 1995).</p> 
<p>Mastitic conditions affect milk composition in sheep as it does in cow or 
goat milk, except that the monitoring indirect parameter of somatic cell counts 
(SCC) in milk is much less related to pathogenic conditions in sheep as it is 
in goat udders compared to cow udders, and that high SSC (&gt;1 million/ml) do 
occur in normal sheep and goat milk, especially towards the end of lactation 
(Bufano et al., 1996). Nevertheless, with increasing SCC it has been reported 
that milk pH, whey protein, fat contents, rennet clotting time, and rate of 
clot firming time rise, while lactose, casein contents, and clot firmness 
decreased (Table&nbsp;8) (Diaz et al., 1996). It has not been determined, 
however, whether the deterioration of renneting characteristics is due 
primarily to the normal physiological SCC increase at the end of lactation and 
the concurrent change in milk composition, or to subclinical and clinical 
mastitic conditions in the udder, which also produce high SCC and changed milk 
composition.</p> 4. Standard nutritional reference tables 
<p>Average nutritional values of sheep milk in comparison to its 3 main 
competitors, cow, human and goat milk have been published years ago most 
comprehensively, but have not been updated apparently (Tables&nbsp;9,&nbsp;10,
&nbsp;11) adapted from (Kon and Cowie, 1961; Posati and Orr, 1976; Renner, 
1982). They do show, however, the superiority of sheep milk composition, in 
relative terms compared to the composition of human, cow and goat milk (
Tables&nbsp;12,&nbsp;13,&nbsp;14); and in such critical nutrients as protein, 
calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, 
vitamin D, medium chain fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, linolenic 
acid, and all 10 essential amino acids. This is shown also in (Table&nbsp;15) 
in actual values compared to the recommended daily minimum allowances for human 
nutrition, when 2 cups (490 g) of milk of one of the 4 species are consumed. 
Most importantly, daily calcium requirements and those of riboflavin and 5 of 
the essential 10 amino acids are completely covered by just drinking 2 cups of 
sheep milk without eating anything else. As drinking sheep milk is not 
widespread, more likely 2 cups of sheep milk yoghurt will meet those daily 
requirements, or the milk equivalent in 93 g of sheep cheese.</p> 
<p>The nutritional values of sheep cheeses have not been published much nor in 
detail compared to those of cow cheeses. (Table&nbsp;16) attempts to show how 
sheep cheeses compared to cow cheeses can make a valuable contribution for 
consumers. More significantly this is demonstrated in (Table&nbsp;17) for MCT, 
the medium chain fatty acids C6:0-C14:0, especially on a total solids or dry 
matter basis.</p> 5. MCT and other uniqueness 
<p>Medium chain length fatty acids or medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have 
been recognised as unique lipids with unique applications (Babayan, 1981; 
Babayan and Rosenau, 1991; Haenlein, 1992). Their medical and nutritional 
values have been the subject of at least 102 publications during the past 10 
years demonstrating real benefits in malabsorption syndroms, chyluria, 
steatorrhea, hyperlipoproteinemia, and in cases of intestinal resection, 
coronary by-pass, premature-infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis 
and gallstones, because of their unique metabolic ability to provide energy 
instead of contributing to adipose tissues as other lipids do. MCT also inhibit 
or limit cholesterol deposition, dissolve cholesterol gallstones, and 
contribute to normal growth of infants. MCT are unique, because they do not 
follow the general lipid transport pathway through the lymphatic system and 
into the prostaglandin metabolism (Babayan and Rosenau, 1991). Instead they go 
through the portal system directly into the liver, where they are oxidised into 
quickly available energy for body utilisation. Thus, patients have been 
prescribed daily intake of MCT supplements for at least 40 years.</p> 
<p>The unique content of about 25% MCT in total sheep milk fat and its 
possible quantitative modification through feeding has not been exploited 
commercially nor explored in research. Daily recommended patient intakes of 15 
g MCT (Dulloo et al., 1996) could be provided by about 60 g sheep butter, but 
sheep butter making may have to be reinvented. A novel approach has been 
proposed by Babayan and Rosenau (1991) to make cheese, either cheddar or 
fontinella, enriched with MCT oil as a palatable and more attractive option for 
patients who suffer from various malabsorption syndroms and must consume MCT.
</p> 
<p>Another interesting research programme is pursued at the University 
Wisconsin (Wendorff 1998) in utilising the unique properties of sheep milk, 
especially its flavourful fatty acids, to enrich the flavour of low-fat cow 
milk cheeses such as Muenster or Manchego by adding 20% sheep milk. The blended 
9-months aged Manchego-type cheese has become popular at the dairy store of the 
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Odorous substances are actually at a higher 
level in sheep milk than in goat or cow milk, except for buffalo milk (
Table&nbsp;18) (Moio et al., 1993). Another potentially important study by 
Ramet (1996) has demonstrated that the poor cheese making properties of camel 
milk can be significantly improved by adding from 10 to 50% sheep milk.</p> 
<p>Of particular interest to dairy sheep farmers is the possibility of using 
sheep milk as an alternative to cow milk in cases of cow milk allergy. Medical 
research, however, has not adequately pursued the many practical experiences 
and anecdotal reports of benefits to patients suffering from cow milk allergy. (
Table&nbsp;3) shows that there has been a fair number of publications on cow 
milk allergy, but few on sheep milk as an alternative. Actually there are at 
least 3 papers during the last 10 years indicating allergy also to sheep milk, 
because of cross reactivity between the milk proteins of bovine, ovine or 
caprine origin (Wuthrich and Johansson, 1995; Fenyvessy and Csanadi, 1999; 
Umpierrez et al., 1999).</p> 6. Niche marketing 
<p>Various nutritional preparations are on the market for use by people in 
need or interested in boosting their energy. Sheep milk has been proposed as a 
more natural and better tasting alternative with great nutritional and clinical 
potential (Hardy, 2000), because of its many valuable constituents, discussed 
here, and in a market estimated e.g. in the U.K. as worth $100 million. Of 
course, the sheep cheese market is well established and growing, but there is 
much room for innovations as the new dairy sheep industry in USA has 
demonstrated in artisanal and direct marketing of sheep cheeses and yogurt with 
the support of the American Cheese Society during the last 10 years.</p> 
<p>Today's consumer is much more interested in low-fat than whole milk. 
Therefore to market any substantial amounts of whole sheep milk with its very 
much higher fat content than cow milk may not be very successful. Low-fat sheep 
milk apparently has not been tried in marketing, but because of its high 
protein content and full taste, it should have potential. Also the resulting 
cream can be a good market in itself or as sheep butter or for sheep ice cream 
production, always utilising the name &quot;sheep&quot; as a special label for 
sales with possibly a higher price. Promotion of sheep milk and its products 
could be much better organised and a greater market share realised, not just a 
special niche for connoisseurs, but also for medical needs, if producers, at 
least in developed countries, would make a regular percentage check-off money 
of their product sales available for a central agency for advertisements and 
research. In many developing countries it is also of vital economic importance 
to assure a fair price for sheep milk products to maintain the farmer's future 
on the farm, besides providing critical protein, calcium and energy food for 
subsistence and to fight malnutrition. In this effort, much is needed to 
improve the genetic ability of many dairy sheep populations to have longer 
lactations and to focus on much better udder morphology.</p>
