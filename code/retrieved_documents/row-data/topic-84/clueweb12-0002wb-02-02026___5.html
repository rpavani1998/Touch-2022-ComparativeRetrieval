<p><b>Goats vs. Cows</b></p> 
<p><b>Why I prefer goats</b></p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I started with a milk cow. When we moved down here to North Eastern TN from 
Chicago to become back-to-the-land homesteaders there were many things I had 
never done before, like milk a cow, or any animal for that matter. I wanted to 
make my own cheese, so, of course, we got a milk cow... Milk = Cow (or so I 
thought).</p>
<p>&quot;Jersey&quot;, the Jersey cow was beautiful and would come when I 
called her. She gave me a lot of milk. But, she also didn't really care to be 
milked and would swat me in the face with her tail. As the thick cloud of flies 
buzzed around, she would eat as I milked, and without notice, arch her back and 
pee. Sometimes she would poop as I was milking her and I quickly pulled the 
bucket away so it would not get contaminated. Her poops were classic cow pies, 
wet and big... yuck. She was big at 800 pounds (not really that big for a cow), 
and we had no special equipment to hold her if we needed to &quot;work&quot; 
her. We couldn't afford this holding equipment either, so Jersey never got 
shots or her temperature taken. Luckily she never needed any medical treatments 
because I do not know how we would have treated her. I made cheese and butter 
and we drank her milk, which was very good.</p> 
<p>The only goat milk I had ever has was from the store.. yuck. Then one day 
we tasted fresh goat milk for the first time. After only a little taste we 
decided to sell Jersey and look for milk goats. We owned three pet, brush 
clearing goats, at the time and knew that they were much easier to handle then 
a cow... even the mean goat &lt;smile&gt;. WHen Jersey rode away in the back of 
a truck, the cloud of flies went with her, never to return.</p> 
<p>Goats are so much easier for the small homesteader to handle and they 
produce, I believe, more milk then a cow for what you put into them (grain, hay 
&amp; water). Goats are cheaper to keep. You can build an inexpensive milkstand 
from left over wood that will hold the goat for milking and medical care. One 
person can hold a goat without a stand if needed. Goats are much cleaner than 
cows; I have never, in my many year of goat keeping, had a goat poop or pee 
while I was milking her. You can sweep up goat poops with a broom; you can not 
sweep up a cow pie. I can haul 4-5 goats in the back of my covered mid sized 
pickup truck; I wouldn't be able to transport on cow in the same truck.</p> 
<p>While my cow's milk was delicious, I find properly handled goat milk even 
better. Goat milk is just plain ol' better for you than cow milk health wise. I 
have heard many stories of human babies not being able to handle cow milk, 
where I know for a fact, that not only can these babies handle goat milk, but 
they thrive on it. I know that goat milk has saved human infants lives. I have 
never heard this about cow milk.</p> 
<p>As far as being &quot;cost effective&quot;. As I said before, I believe 
goats are cheaper to keep. You say, there is no market for goat's milk. I write 
this referring to how goats are a better choice for a family milker, not as a 
money maker. I personally believe that goats are a better choice for a family 
milker. If you want to make money, don't think goats will make it for you, but 
then, unless you can afford a lot of cows, they aren't going to make you money 
for you either (due to the high initial cost of keeping cows).</p> 
<p><strong>Butter from goat milk:</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>You may think that you can't make butter from a goat's milk because goat 
cream doesn't rise like cow cream does; but this isn't necessarily the case. To 
get goat cream, I recommend doing one of two things. You could either 1) get a 
cream separator or 2) collect the smaller amount of cream that does rise. I do 
not own a cream separator myself because they are rather expensive (but this 
investment would still be cheaper then keeping a cow). Though cream does not 
rise as easily in goat milk, some cream does indeed rise; you just need to be 
patient. I used to make my own goat butter all the time (I don't anymore 
becasue I just don't find it worth the time and effort; I use olive oil instead 
of butter in most cases). I would save the milk I got each day in gallon jars 
and let it sit in the back of the fridge for a couple of days. Some of the 
cream would rise and was easily skimmed off (just like you do with cow milk). I 
put the skimmed off cream in a 2 quart plastic container and placed it in the 
freezer. Every time I had goat milk to skim, I pull out the cream container and 
add to it. When it is full, I removde the frozen cream from the freezer and let 
it thaw on the counter. I then added a little culture to the cream as it is 
thawing to sour it, because I like to make butter from sour cream. Using this 
method I got enough cream to make butter to supply Larry and I with all the 
butter we needed. Also, because not all of the cream rises in goat milk, the 
milk that has been skimmed of it's cream still tastes just as good as whole 
milk and can be used for drinking or to make cheese.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Goats and cows eat different things. Cows are graizers; goats are 
browser/graizers. Goats can be kept on steeper, rougher, land that has trees 
and brush (they will eat the trees and brush). A cow can be kept on steep land, 
but because of their weight and size, they will tear the land up, where a goat 
does not cause much damage to the land itself. However, goats will kill trees, 
where cows won't.</p> 
<p>Goats are safer to be around. A full grown goat weighs about 150 pounds, 
where a full grown cow weighs 800+ pounds. I would never let a small child be 
around a cow, where a small child could safely be around some goats. Also, 
bucks (male goats) are much safer than bulls (male cows). Where a buck can be 
cantankerous, a bull can be downright deadly.</p> 
<p>And finally, on the relationship side, goats are just plain smarter than 
cows and also more loving. You can have a close, loving, pet relationship with 
a goat; you cannot, in my experience, have this kind of relationship with a cow.
