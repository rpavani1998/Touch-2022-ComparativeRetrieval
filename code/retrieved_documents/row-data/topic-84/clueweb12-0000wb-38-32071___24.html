<p>This site provides a multitude of information on the care and keeping of 
dairy goats, with an emphasis on a natural and humane approach.&nbsp; These 
pages contain information on all aspects of goat raising and goat care 
including: health &amp; husbandry, feeding, medications, wormers &amp; worming, 
natural, herbal &amp; holistic health care, breeding, kidding, milking, 
behavior, how-to instructions, free downloads, and much more.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This web site is intended to aid the reader in the care and keeping of 
dairy goats. In my methods, I emphasize natural &amp; holistic health care and 
treat our animals with the love, dignity and the respect they deserve.</p> 
<p>This site is dedicated to all those who want to learn how to raise your 
goats in a loving and humane manner. This is my gift of &quot;metta&quot; 
(loving kindness, compassion and friendship) to you</p> 
<p>The information presented here reflects the way I do things . There are as 
many ways to raise goats as there are people who own goats. It is helpful to 
know how others do things, and with this knowledge you can then develop your 
own way of raising goats that works best for you and your own situation.</p> 
<p><strong>In loving memory of Goldie, matriarch of our herd, wonderful 
friend, and the most extraordinary animal I will ever have the honor to have 
known.</strong><br>

<p>I raise full size Dairy Goats; this what I know and what this site is 
geared to. You may have to adjust the provided information according to the 
type of goat you raise (i.e. Pygmies, Nigerians, etc.). My main goat focus is 
to raise healthy, friendly goats as family milk producers, pets and companions.

<b>Books</b> The very first thing we 
always recommend to goatkeepers (new and old) is...<i>get a book</i>! More than 
one if you can. The more you learn, the better off you<i>and</i> your goats 
will be. I have compiled the followinglist of useful and informative books for 
your convenience. <br>
<b></b><strong>Normal Goat Health Information</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>Temperature = 102.5 - 104 - This varies depending on the temperature of 
the goat's surroundings.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Pulse rate = 70 - 80 beats per minute</li> 
<li>Respiration =15 to 30 per minute</li> 
<li>Rumen (stomach) movements = 1 - 1.5 per minute</li> 
<li>Puberty = 7 weeks - 8 months (separate bucks from does at 2 month)</li> 
<li>Estrus/Heat Cycle = 17 to 23 days</li> 
<li>Gestation = 143 to 155 days</li> 
<li>Life span: 
<ul> 
<li>Does = 11-12 years average age, but... usually the death in does is 
kidding related.&nbsp; Does that are &quot;retired&quot; from breeding around 
age 10 live longer: 16-18 years (and I just recently found a doe who was 24; 
she was retired from kidding at age 10).</li> 
<li>Wethers = 11-16 years average age</li> 
<li>Bucks = 8-10 average age - bucks usually live shorter lives than does and 
wethers due to the stresses of going into rut each year.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Full growth size: Most goats do not reach their full size until they are 
about three years of age. (They keep growing for about three years)</li> </ul>

Questions &amp; Answers
<ul> 
<li>Can I stagger breeding so that I can have milk year 'round?</li> 
<li>How much milk could I expect from just one goat at each milking?</li> 
<li>What can I do to increase milk production?</li> 
<li>If we are milking our doe and she becomes pregnant again, do we need to 
stop milking at anytime during her gestation period?</li> 
<li>Does a goat have to have babies to make milk? </li> 
<li>Once a doe kids, do I have to milk the doe, or will she just dry up once 
the kids are weaned? I don't want to milk if I don't have to.</li> 
<li>There are clumps in my does milk. Does this mean she has mastitis?</li> 
<li>There is blood in my doe's milk or the milk is pink. Does this mean she 
has mastitis?</li> 
<li>Does letting the kids nurse their mother &quot;ruin&quot; or tear up the 
udder?</li> 
<li>My doe has kind of formed her udder, but her teats are still small and not 
starting to elongate. They are still the same size as when she was never 
pregnant. This is her first pregnancy. Is it normal for her teats to still be 
so small, or is there something I should do for her?</li> 
<li>How long does it take to milk a goat? </li> 
<li>There is blood in my doe's milk, should I be concerned?&nbsp; Can I still 
use the milk?</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Milking, Miking Once a Day, and Taking Time Off from Milking 
</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Milking once a day</strong>-I only milk once a day, here's how I 
do it.</li> 
<li><strong>The Milking Cycle- Milk yield information</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Taste</strong>- Properly handled goat milk is sweet, delicious and 
wonderful, tasting just like whole milk from the grocery store (if not better). 
It should not be bitter, bad tasting or &quot;bucky&quot;. If your goat's milk 
is &quot;off&quot; there must be a reason. Here are reasons the goat's milk may 
not be tasting correct.
<ul> 
<li>Will what the goat eats effect the flavor of the milk? </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Teat Dip</strong>- This homemade dip is just as good, if not 
better than &quot;store-bought&quot;.</li> 
<li><strong> Udder Information and Q&amp;A </strong>- Also see Milk &amp; 
Milking Page 
<ul> 
<li>Is it possible for a doe to start filling her udder and making milk 
without ever being pregnant?</li> 
<li>What if the kid (or kids) is/are only nursing from one side of the udder?
</li> 
<li> If you let the kids nurse their mother, will it ruin her udder? </li> 
<li>My doe's teats are still small and not starting to elongate. They are 
still the same size as when she was never pregnant....</li> 
<li>I think my doe might be getting really close to going in to labor.&nbsp; 
I've looked at so many of the photos on your website and others' websites and 
my goat does not have that &quot;big bag&quot; like I see in the photos. Is 
this normal?</li> </ul> </li>
