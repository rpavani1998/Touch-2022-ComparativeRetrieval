<h1>Did Cow&rsquo;s Milk Get Your Goat?</h1>  posted on September 27, 2011 by 
Adventuresgfmom <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>I am very excited to have my dear friend Alisa Fleming guest post here 
today.&nbsp; Alisa is the founder and chief editor of the popular website,
<strong>Go Dairy Free</strong>, she also authors her personal blog, <strong>
Alisa Cooks</strong>.&nbsp; In addition to running two websites (phew, I need a 
nap just thinking about that!), Alisa is also the author of a fantastic book,
<strong>Go Dairy Free: The Guide and Cookbook for Milk Allergies, Lactose 
Intolerance, and Casein-Free Living</strong>, which has been my constant 
companion in the kitchen since both of my children were diagnosed with a casein 
intolerance just over a year ago.</p> 
<p>Like many of my readers, I also pondered if goat&rsquo;s milk would be a 
safe alternative for my kiddos.&nbsp; After doing quite a bit of research on 
casein (which I will share in an upcoming post), I personally decided to avoid 
going that route given our family&rsquo;s history of celiac disease and 
autoimmunity.&nbsp; Everyone is different though, so I asked Alisa if she could 
help explain the differences and similarities of various mammal milks and why 
they may or may not be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for those with dairy 
allergies/intolerances.</p> 
<p>Welcome, Alisa! </p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m honored to be guest posting here today, and 
excited to share a little insight about an often misunderstood food, goat 
milk.&nbsp; Heidi requested that I address goat milk for her readers since it 
seems to be a source of confusion among many who have issues with dairy.&nbsp; 
Seriously, I would be a very wealthy woman if I received a dollar (why stop at 
a dime as long as I&rsquo;m dreaming here) every time I received the question 
&ldquo;Is goat milk considered dairy?&rdquo; from viewers of<strong>Go Dairy 
Free</strong>.</p> 
<p>Right from the get-go let&rsquo;s clear the air&hellip;in general ALL 
mammal milks (sheep, goat, camel, etc.) and their related products (cheese, 
sour cream, etc.) are classified as dairy.&nbsp; In fact, if you look up goat 
milk and sheep milk online, you will probably come across the<strong>American 
Dairy Goat Association</strong> and the <strong>Wisconsin Sheep Dairy 
Cooperative</strong>.</p> 
<p>So why can some people tolerate one type of milk, but not another?&nbsp; I 
go into great detail on this topic in my book,<strong>Go Dairy Free: The Guide 
and Cookbook for Milk Allergies, Lactose Intolerance, and Casein-Free Living
</strong>, covering the benefits of the different milks and why they might work 
for some, but today I&rsquo;ll stick to Heidi&rsquo;s question, touching on 
goat milk.</p> 
<p>The milks from different mammals have slightly different compositions, 
which is why some people may be allergic to cow milk but able to tolerate goat 
milk.&nbsp; Human milk is obviously the least allergenic milk for humans, as it 
is &ldquo;designed&rdquo; specifically for our bodies.&nbsp; The closer a milk 
is in composition to human milk, the lower the probability of being allergic.
</p> 
<p>The predominant milk protein (casein) in goat milk is slightly closer in 
composition to human milk than cow milk is, and thus may be easier to tolerate 
and digest for some individuals.&nbsp; There aren&rsquo;t any firm numbers, but 
it&rsquo;s been estimated that roughly 20 to 40% of milk allergic individuals 
do not react to goat milk products.&nbsp; However, that leaves a whopping 60 to 
80% of us who do, so it is best to get an allergy test before trialing a 
challenge with goat milk, particularly where severe allergies are a 
concern.&nbsp; Also, keep in mind that albeit rare, some people are more 
allergic to goat milk than cow milk! There are no hard and fast rules when it 
comes to our immune systems.</p> 
<p>If you are testing dairy-free living via an elimination diet, you may be 
doing yourself a huge injustice if you consume goat milk during the cow milk 
elimination.&nbsp; Personally, I would remove all dairy, including goat.&nbsp; 
Then, if and when symptoms subside, I might challenge with goat milk to see if 
it is tolerated. I&rsquo;ve personally never consumed goat milk products or 
&ldquo;challenged&rdquo; with them, since I know I am allergic.&nbsp; Also, I 
must disclaim that you shouldn&rsquo;t undergo any change in diet without the 
supervision of a physician.&nbsp; Are we all clear on that?&nbsp; Good.</p> 
<p>Moving on&hellip;there some other factors to keep in mind regarding goat 
milk products&hellip;</p> 
<p>First, unlike casein, which can vary in composition from mammal to mammal, 
lactose is typically lactose.&nbsp; Someone who is lactose intolerant may even 
be intolerant to the lactose in human milk.&nbsp; The amount of lactose from 
milk product to milk product can vary slightly; for example it has been 
calculated at 4.1% in goat milk and 4.7% in cow milk.&nbsp; There are some 
other factors in goat milk that make it easier to digest for some people (see
<strong>Go Dairy Free: The Guide and Cookbook </strong>for details), but if you 
are quite lactose intolerant, chugging back glasses of goat milk probably 
wouldn&rsquo;t be a nice thing to do to your stomach.</p> 
<p>Second, as mentioned, mammal milks do have slightly different make-ups, and 
the differences don&rsquo;t necessarily end with casein.&nbsp; Goat milk is 
significantly lower in folic acid and vitamin B-12 than cow milk, so make sure 
you eating plenty of leafy greens and foods such as meat and chicken, or 
supplement if relying on goat milk for nutrition.</p> 
<p>This is just the tip of the dairy iceberg, but hopefully helps to answer a 
few of your questions and concerns about goat milk.&nbsp; I go into more detail 
on goat milk, sheep milk, raw milk,<strong>A2 milk</strong>, camel milk (yes, I 
said camel milk), the different milk alternatives and more in my book,<strong>
Go Dairy Free</strong>. Oh, and there are over 200 recipes in there too, for 
those of you (like me) who go straight to the food!</p>

<p>Great post, Heidi and Alisa. There are so many variables when it comes to 
what different people can tolerate and you've made it easy to understand, 
Alisa. I refer to your &quot;Go Dairy Free&quot; book quite often, even in my 
business as a nutritionist. It is the most comprehensive resource out there on 
the differences in milk allergies and intolerances and what people can do to 
regain their health. Anyone with concerns about dairy should have a copy in 
their resource library. And, dairy-free or not, the recipes are wonderful!</p>

<p>My little guy can't have any cow dairy~ lactose or casein. When I 
discovered it, I contemplated trying goats milk. However upon my first google 
search I decided that if he had that big of a problem with cow dairy, chances 
are he would with goat so we never tried it. Another reason for not trying 
alternate mammal dairy is that he didn't like dairy to begin with. Now that he 
is dairy free he actually likes the vegan versions of things better than the 
originals~ hmmmm I think his little body knew something better than any test 
out there (by the way he tested negative for allergy). Thanks for the post. I 
will have to check Alisa out on FB </p> </li>

<p>Great post! Alisa, this was straightforward and simple. I love your book 
and your website and refer to it quite a bit for &quot;uncheese&quot; ideas. 
I've recently been testing goat dairy (as in I've had a touch of cultured goat 
butter on veggies &ndash; I guess that's like dipping my big toe in the water 
to see if it's comfortable) and have been okay so far, but it's different for 
everyone. I love that you share great recipes &ndash; no one misses the dairy!

<p>Wonderful guest post from Alisa! Her words about all mammal milk still 
being dairy have stuck in my mind since she spoke to my support group a few 
years ago. A friend and I who try to stay dairy free always commiserate with 
each other after eating another friend's homemade goat cheese. We love her 
homemade chevre and it affects us less than cow dairy, but we both realize that 
it still affects us. We really have to have dairy (and other offenders) out of 
our diet to see its effects though. And really I love dairy-free eating and 
recipes. Alisa's book is an outstanding resource for all. I will pick it up to 
look at a recipe and the next thing you know I'm re-reading it, because it's so 
comprehensive and well researched. Yes, it's that good!</p>

<p>Cheese is my biggest hang up on being dairy-free&hellip;and yes, I've been 
guilty of sneaking some goat cheese every now and then! Like everything else, 
it's a journey especially the older you are when you do it. Of course, it's not 
made any easier when you don't have a &quot;true&quot; dairy allergy 
(especially if you don't notice any overt symptoms like me). Sam and Luke's 
reaction to dairy is blatantly obvious (Luke with eczema and diarrhea and Sam 
with constipation and excessive congestion)&hellip;dairy is a lot like gluten 
for me, it lurks around silently until all heck breaks loose with serious 
problems.</p> 
<p>Alisa's book was so enlightening for me, it launched me into discovering 
how much casein is gluten's notorious sidekick!</p>

<p>I can't handle cow's milk, and for a while tried raw goat's milk thinking 
it was working for me&hellip; but my hayfever and sinus problems never went 
away until I completely went off all dairy. I found it interesting that I 
reacted worse to the dried (powdered) goat's milk, which I tried making 
ice-cream with once. So I keep away from all dairy now. I'd love to read 
Alisa's book &ndash; must get it! Thanks </p> </li>

<p>I can handle goat's yoghurt but goat's cheese makes me extremely ill. 
Haven't tried goat's milk but don't think I'll risk it either. I''m completely 
dairy free as I feel it's safer that way.</p> </li>

<p>I had been told for years, by Dr's mind you, that dairy only refered to 
cow's milk and cow's milk products. Even up to the point where I started my 
blog, I still believed this to be true.</p> 
<p>Heidi, it was a conversation we had on Facebook, just after I had started 
blogging, that pushed me to pursue further.</p> 
<p>Now we are completely casein free, not just cow's milk free&hellip;and 
where I once enjoyed cheese on the side, I have discovered that I am sooooo 
much better off without dairy at all.</p> 
<p>This is a great post, Alisa is a wonderful advocate for all things dairy 
free.</p> 
<p>Thank you ladies! xoxo</p> </li> </ul> <br>
