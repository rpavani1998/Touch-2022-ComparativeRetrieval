<p>While cheese making a fairly simple process, it helps to learn the basics 
before you begin. Starting with a little history.<br>
<br>
Archeologists 
believe goat cheese was &ldquo;invented&rdquo; around 6000 B.C.E. We know it 
was a favorite of the Sumerians by 4000 B.C.E. Ancient Egyptian murals depict 
cheese and buttermaking, and cheese is mentioned in the Old Testament.</p>

<br>
The Greeks adored cheese. In 
the eighth century B.C.E., Homer mentions cheese in his epic poem, &ldquo;The 
Odyssey.&rdquo; Olympic athletes grew fleet and brawny on a mostly-cheese diet.
<br> <br>
The caseale, or cheese kitchen, was a fixture in Roman villas. The 
Romans enjoyed an enormous selection of cheeses, among them curd, soft, hard, 
smoked and salted varieties, frequently peppered with a plethora of herbs and 
spices. Hard cheeses were a Roman export commodity and they comprised, along 
with crusty bread, a goodly portion of a Roman legionnaire&rsquo;s daily 
rations.<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Lemon Cheese</strong><br>
<br>
After working under small-scale 
cheese makers in England, France, Holland and Canada, in 1978 Ricki Carroll 
opened the New England Cheesemaking Supply. Via her website and catalog, Ricki 
markets supplies and resources gathered from around the globe.<br>
<br>
Some 
are her own creations: cheese making kits, starters, a CD-ROM and video, and 
the third printing of Home Cheese Making (considered by many to be the 
&ldquo;bible&rdquo; of home cheese making), first published in 1982 as 
Cheesemaking Made Easy. The user-friendly paperback is packed with recipes for 
more than 75 homemade cheeses, plus troubleshooting guides and an extensive 
resources section.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When I began making cheese, I was part of a 
do-it-yourself culture,&rdquo; says Ricki. &ldquo;We were trying to reclaim the 
self-sufficiency that made our ancestors the independent folks they were. Today 
cheese making is the new wave. Our workshops are filled and we sponsored a tour 
of France last October. I field dozens of phone and e-mail questions every day. 
Anyone, anywhere, can make cheese. We&rsquo;re here to help them do it.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Recipe from <em>Home Cheese Making</em> by Ricki Carroll&nbsp; (Storey 
Publishing, 2002, with permission). This moist cheese has a spreadable 
consistency and a mild, lemony flavor.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&frac12; gallon whole milk</li> 
<li>Juice of 2 to 3 large lemons or approximately &frac14; cup</li> 
<li>Cheese salt (optional)</li> 
<li>Herbs (optional) </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In a large pot, directly heat the milk to 175 degrees F. Add the juice 
from two of the lemons and stir well.<br>
</li> 
<li>Cover and let the milk set for 15 minutes (you are looking for a clear 
separation of the curds and whey, not milky whey). If the milk has not yet set, 
add more of the remaining lemon juice until it does set.<br>
</li> 
<li>Pour the curds into a colander lined with butter muslin. Tie the corners 
of the butter muslin into a knot and hang the bag to drain for one to two 
hours, or until the curds have stopped draining.<br>
</li> 
<li>Remove the cheese from the bag. Add salt and herbs to taste, if desired.
<br></li> 
<li>Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for one to two weeks.<br>

</li> 
<li><strong>Yield: About one pound.</strong>&nbsp; </li> </ul> <br>
<br>
The 
first European cheese, quark, is described in records dating to 3 B.C.E. During 
the Middle Ages monks began perfecting many of the cheeses we know today.<br>

<br>Cheese making is a relatively simple process that involves the curdling of 
milk to separate curds (those milky white clumps in ricotta and cottage 
cheeses) and whey (a clear to yellowish, watery fluid used to make whey cheese).
<br> <br>
Following a specific recipe is the key, but understanding the basics 
before getting started will simplify the process for you.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Cheese 
Classifications&nbsp; <br>
The USDA bulletin &ldquo;Cheese Varieties and 
Descriptions&rdquo; catalogs 400 varieties of cheese, but far more exist. 
Cheeses are classified in a number of ways:<br>
<br>
- <strong>Fresh</strong>: 
<em>Cottage, Ricotta and farmer cheeses</em> <br>
<br>
- <strong>Quick aged
</strong>: <em>Farmhouse Cheddar, Camembert,&nbsp; Haloumi</em> <br>
<br>
- 
<strong>Aged</strong>: <em>Sharp Cheddar, Bleu, Parmesan<br>
</em> <br>
- 
<strong>Cow</strong>: <em>Camembert, Gorgonzola, Asiago<br>
</em> <br>
- 
<strong>Goat</strong>: <em>Chevre, Caprino, Aragon<br>
</em> <br>
- <strong>
Sheep</strong>: <em>Pecorino Romano, Manchango, Roquefort<br>
</em> <br>
- 
<strong>Water Buffalo</strong>: <em>Mozzarella di Bufala, Borelli, Toma</em> 
<br> <br>
- <strong>Very Soft</strong>: <em>Mascarpone, Neufch&acirc;tel, 
Fromage Blanc<br>
</em> <br>
- <strong>Soft</strong>: <em>Brie, Limburger, Feta
<br></em> <br>
- <strong>Semisoft</strong>: <em>Baby Swiss, Butterkase, Mysost
<br></em> <br>
- <strong>Semihard</strong>: <em>Brick, Edam, Gouda<br>
</em> 
<br>- <strong>Hard</strong>: <em>Parmesan, Stilton, Romano<br>
</em> <br>

However, classes aren&rsquo;t carved in stone. Feta can be fashioned of sheep 
or goat&rsquo;s milk, Mysost can be soft to semihard. Aging times vary greatly. 
It depends on who makes the cheese&mdash;and that could be you.<br>
<br>

<strong>Milk to Use in Cheese<br>
</strong>You will need milk for all cheese 
making endeavors. The milk you choose can be homegrown or store-bought, 
pasteurized and homogenized, or not, whole or skimmed, and the product of cows, 
goats or sheep.
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li><em><strong>Cow Milk</strong><br>
</em>Most cheesemaking recipes assume 
you&rsquo;ll use cow milk, but with minor modifications, you can usually 
substitute goat or sheep milk. Cow milk produces a firm, easy-to-work-with 
curd. One gallon of cow milk yields roughly two pounds of soft cheese or one 
pound of hard. And best, it&rsquo;s readily available.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><em><strong>Goat Milk</strong></em><br>
Because goat milk is naturally 
homogenized, goat cheeses are easy to digest. Their tart, tangy flavor is 
appealing and unique. Goat milk lacks carotene, the substance that gives cow 
milk its yellow hue, so unless you add coloring, goat cheeses are invariably 
white. Goat milk curds are delicate, so lower the heat five degrees when using 
recipes tailored for cow milk. And process goat curds with a gentle hand.<br>

<br></li> 
<li><strong><em>Sheep Milk</em><br>
</strong>Although dairy sheep are scarce 
in North America, globally that&rsquo;s not the case. About 100 million sheep 
(one-tenth of the world&rsquo;s population) are milked, and much of that milk 
goes into cheese. The distinctive flavor, texture and aroma of sheep cheese 
tickles many palates and lactose intolerant cheese aficionados can usually 
digest sheep-milk cheeses. Because it contains 10 percent less water than goat 
or cow milk and more than twice the solids, sheep milk yields up to two and 
one-half times more cheese than its competitors. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough 
to have sheep milk to use in cow-milk recipes, add three to five times less 
rennet and only half the recommended salt.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><strong><em>Raw Milk</em><br>
</strong>Raw milk purchased at natural food 
stores has been filtered and cooled, but not pasteurized. It is higher in 
vitamin content and considerably more flavorful than processed milk. The bad 
news: raw milk can harbor tuberculosis, brucellosis and salmonella bacteria. 
Only raw milk from tested animals should be used in cheese making.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li><em><strong>Pasteurized Milk</strong><br>
</em> 
<p><strong>Ricki&rsquo;s 30-Minute Mozzarella<br>
</strong><br>
From <em>Home 
Cheese Making</em> by Ricki Carroll<br>
(Storey Publishing, 2002, with 
permission).</p> 
<p>The following recipe is a quick and easy way to make fresh Mozzarella at 
home in less than 30 minutes. Make sure the milk you use for this cheese is
<strong>NOT</strong> ultrapasteurized, otherwise you will end up with Ricotta 
instead of Mozzarella.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
<br>
2 level teaspoons citric acid<br>
1 
gallon pasteurized whole milk (see Note in Step 1 below)<br>
? - &frac14; 
teaspoon lipase powder (see Note in Step 1 below), dissolved in &frac14; cup 
cool water and allowed to sit for 20 minutes, for a stronger flavor (optional)
<br>&frac14; teaspoon liquid rennet (or &frac14; rennet tablet) diluted 
in&nbsp;&frac14; cup cool, unchlorinated water<br>
1 teaspoon cheese salt 
(optional)</p> 
<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Add the citric acid to the milk and stir thoroughly. (If using lipase, add 
it now) Note: You may use skim milk, but the yield will be lower and the cheese 
will be drier. If you add lipase to this cheese, you may have to use a bit more 
rennet, as lipase makes the cheese softer. Try the recipe without it and 
experiment later.<br>
</li> 
<li>Heat the milk to 88 degrees F. (The milk will start to curdle) <br>
</li> 
<li>Gently stir in the diluted rennet with an up-and-down motion, and continue 
heating until the temperature reaches 105 degrees F. Turn off the heat and let 
the curd set until you get a clean break when you insert the thermometer at a 
45 degree angle. This will take only a few minutes.<br>
</li> 
<li>The curd should look like thick yogurt. If the whey is still milky, wait a 
few more minutes.<br>
</li> 
<li>Scoop out the curds with a slotted spoon and put them into a two-quart 
microwave-safe bowl. Press the curds gently with your hands, pouring off as 
much whey as possible. Reserve the whey.<br>
</li> 
<li>Microwave the curds on high for one minute. More whey will precipitate 
from the curd. Again, drain off all excess whey. Quickly work the cheese with a 
spoon or your hands, forming it into a ball until it is cool enough to touch. 
(Wear rubber gloves; the cheese has to be almost too hot to touch before it 
will stretch.)<br>
</li> 
<li>Microwave two more times for 35 seconds each. After each heating, work the 
cheese into a ball until it is cool enough to touch. Drain all excess whey each 
time.<br>
</li> 
<li>Knead quickly like bread dough until it is smooth. Sprinkle on the salt, 
if desired, while you are kneading and stretching. When the cheese stretches 
like taffy, it is done. If it breaks, the curds will need to be reheated.<br>

</li> 
<li>When the cheese is smooth and shiny, it is ready to eat. Although this 
mozzarella is best eaten right away, if you must wait, cover it and store in 
the refrigerator.<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Yield: &frac34; to one pound</strong><br>
</li> </ul> 
<p><em><strong>Tip</strong>: For a firmer cheese, use more rennet. If your 
cheese is too hard, use less rennet. If the curds turn into the consistency of 
ricotta cheese and will not come together, change the brand of milk; it may 
have been heat-treated at the factory to too high a temperature. Most of all, 
be patient. When you get this to work, you will never stop eating it.</em></p> 
<br> <br>
Pasteurized milk is heat-treated to zap those nasty bacteria. The 
process robs milk of flavor and makes its vitamins, milk sugars and proteins 
harder to digest. Still, pasteurized milk is undoubtedly a safer product. 
Supermarket milk is pasteurized and homogenized. It&rsquo;s heat-treated and 
pressurized to thwart cream separation. Store-bought milk yields a smoother, 
looser curd than home-produced milks, but adding calcium chloride makes it 
handle more like unpasteurized milk. Worth noting: it takes up to twice as much 
rennet to curdle homogenized cow milk, so start with the recommended amount and 
gradually add more solution until those reluctant curds appear.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><strong><em>Whole Milk</em><br>
</strong>Whole milk boasts three and a 
half to four percent butterfat; its cream content is intact. Hard cheeses made 
from high-fat milk are generally softer than skim milk varieties but their 
&ldquo;mouth feel&rdquo; is superbly rich and silky.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><strong><em>Skim Milk</em><br>
</strong>Skimmed milk contains zero to two 
percent butterfat. It&rsquo;s fine for making reduced-fat and soft cheeses. 
Hard grating cheeses like parmesan and romano are always fashioned from 
partially skimmed milk. You can enrich seven pints of homogenized fresh or 
reconstituted skim milk with a pint of heavy cream to recreate raw milk&rsquo;s 
great taste and its easier cheese making properties.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the 
type of milk you choose, make certain it&rsquo;s fresh. Don&rsquo;t crack the 
container until you&rsquo;re ready to begin. Rancid or &ldquo;barn-yardy&rdquo; 
milks never make tasty cheese.</li> </ul> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>Cheese-making Supplies</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Acidifier</strong><br>
Besides the milk, to make cheese 
you&rsquo;ll need an acidifier to convert milk sugar to lactic acid and 
&ldquo;ripen&rdquo; your milk. This can be something as simple as lemon juice 
or as technical as the special bacterial starter cultures purchased from a 
cheese-making supplier. Freeze-dried direct-set cultures are a snap to 
use&mdash;pour them directly from the packet into your milk&mdash;and they stay 
fresh in a freezer as long as two years.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Rennet</strong><br>
Next, you&rsquo;ll need rennet, the enzyme 
that separates milk into curds and whey. Nearly all cheese making recipes call 
for rennet. In olden days, cheese makers soaked a scrap of the fourth stomach 
of a newborn calf or kid in warm brine to create rennet. Although animal 
rennets are still used, vegetable rennets work equally well. Rennet can be 
purchased as liquid, tablets and powder. Liquid rennet must be refrigerated, 
and the others require freezing. Rennet should be measured carefully and 
diluted in 20 to 50 times its measure of cool, unchlorinated water. The 
solution should be allowed to age for 20 minutes before using. You can purchase 
rennet from cheese making suppliers and at natural food stores. 
&ldquo;Junket&rdquo; is a mild rennet sometimes found in grocery stores 
alongside packaged puddings. In a pinch, it can be used in soft cheese recipes, 
substituting four or five Junket tablets for each one of commercial rennet.<br>

<br></li> 
<li><strong>Citric Acid</strong><br>
For fashioning mozzarella you&rsquo;ll 
need citric acid. If you savor tangier cheeses, add lipase powder too. Some 
pharmacies carry citric acid, and because it&rsquo;s also used to acidify 
home-canned tomatoes, you can sometimes find it in grocery or hardware store 
home-canning displays.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Salt</strong><br>
Coarse, non-iodized cheese salt draws moisture 
from curd, hastens aging and imparts considerable flavor. Iodized salts 
won&rsquo;t do; iodine inhibits starter growth and slows the aging process. 
Non-iodized pickling and crystal kosher salts work well if you can find them.
<br><br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Flavorings</strong><br>
Fresh herbs are a traditional flavoring 
for soft cheeses. If you like, fold in garlic, scallions, chives, horseradish, 
oregano, sage, dill, basil, parsley, thyme or caraway (alone or in combination) 
to your recipe. Other possibilities are bacon crumbles and small fruits like 
blueberries and sliced strawberries. For optimal flavor, age seasoned cheeses 
in the fridge for a day or two before sampling.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Other Supplies</strong><br>
You&rsquo;ll also need a stainless 
steel, enamelware or glass pot large enough to hold a gallon of milk; a 
two-quart glass bowl; metal measuring and slotted stirring spoons; a colander; 
butter muslin (if you need to, substitute many layers of grocery store 
cheesecloth or a single layer of linen or nylon tricot fabric); a cheese-making 
thermometer (that registers 60 to 220 degrees F); and possibly heavy rubber 
gloves.</li> </ul> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>Cleanliness: A&nbsp;Must in Cheese Making<br>
</strong>The golden 
rule of cheese making: Clean it and keep it clean. Immerse your bowl and 
utensils in boiling water for at least five minutes before and after every 
cheese-making session. Swab your work area with a clean cloth dipped in a 
solution of two tablespoons household bleach to one gallon of water. Wash your 
hands carefully and often. Don&rsquo;t let stray bacteria spoil your cheese.<br>
<br><strong>Kits are a Good Way to Get Started <br>
</strong>The easiest way to 
get started making cheese is with a kit that simply requires the addition of 
milk. The New England Cheesemaking Supply, Glenngarry Cheesemaking and Dairy 
Supply, and Leener&rsquo;s Brew Works (See &ldquo;Cheese Making Supplies&rdquo; 
at right for contact information) all sell a variety of kits designed with the 
novice in mind.<br>

<p>New England Cheese Supply&rsquo;s Mozzarella kit costs only $19.95 and 
ships with an instruction and recipe booklet, vegetable rennet tablets, citric 
acid, cheese salt, butter muslin and a cheese-making thermometer. It makes 
delicious Mozzarella in three-quarter pound batches, up to 40 pounds per kit. 
At $11.95, Leener&rsquo;s kit omits the thermometer but adds lipase powder and 
calcium chloride, enough of everything to craft nine pounds of cheese. 
Mozzarella and soft cheese kits are fine introductions to the cheese 
crafter&rsquo;s art.<br>
<br>
Follow the cheese recipes exactly and 
you&rsquo;re on your way. When you savor the inexpensive, scrumptious, 
preservative-free fruits of your labor, you&rsquo;ll be hooked. Buy a 
cheese-making book, craft some molds, build a press and graduate to more and 
more complex cheeses.<br>
<br>
<strong>Making Cheese for Fun or Profit<br>

</strong>So you want to market artisan cheese? You&rsquo;re not alone. More 
than 250 specialty cheese makers handcrafted millions of pounds of artisan 
cheeses in 2002, with more entering the field each year. And rightfully so. 
Sales of specialty cheeses topped $2.4 billion in 2000, up four percent from 
1999, and are expected to rise an additional four percent per annum through 
2005.<br>
<br>
One-third of all supermarkets offer full-service cheese 
counters; almost 60 percent claim artisan cheeses comprise at least half of 
their selections. Educational signage and handouts tell where cheeses come 
from, what they taste like, how old they are, how to serve them, with which 
wines they go best. Most cheese retailers offer samples. As a result, more and 
more consumers recognize fine cheese.<br>
<br>
And American artisan cheese is 
getting better and better. A panel of 12 international experts at the 24th 
annual 2002 World Championship Cheese Contest, the largest international cheese 
competition in the world, awarded American artisan cheese makers 49 honors 
including 16 &ldquo;Best of Class,&rdquo; more than any other nation 
represented.<br>
<br>
<strong>Advice on Getting into the Cheese Business<br>

</strong>Veteran home cheese maker Ricki Carroll, of the New England 
Cheesemaking Supply, cautions budding cheese entrepreneurs, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t 
quit your day job. It takes a huge investment in time and money to establish a 
viable cheese-making venture. The legalities can be overwhelming. Before you 
invest, make sure this is for you.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Start small by playing 
around in the kitchen, taking the time to learn your craft,&rdquo; she advises. 
&ldquo;One of our customers began with our easy Mozzarella kit and now 
he&rsquo;s making 45 varieties of cheese in his basement. He&rsquo;s doing this 
very scientifically, he&rsquo;s even built a cave down there to age his 
cheeses.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Above all, Ricki advises to educate yourself. 
&ldquo;Visit some of the many artisan cheese makers around the 
country&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find a listing of them on the American Cheese 
Society website (http://cheesesociety.org). Join the American Cheese Society, 
go to one of their meetings and meet people who have done it. Go to symposiums. 
Take one of our European cheese-making tours. Find out what people in your area 
like. You want to fill a demand with something possiblyunique to your 
area.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Once you&rsquo;re ready, if you meet federal and state 
regulations (and there are a lot of them), start selling at farmers&rsquo; 
markets and festivals. Approach local stores and restaurants about featuring 
your cheeses. You can accomplish this, but it takes time and expertise.<br>

 Reader Comments  This is a very informative and helpful 
website. My daughter and I kefir raw goat milk and make smoothies and eat the 
curds with fresh fruit. It is so good and healthy. Now I want to make some 
cheese. It sounds fairly easy and I am chomping at the bit to get started. 
Thank you. <b>LaVern, Lake Wales, FL<br>
