<h2>New studies on goat milk show it is more beneficial&hellip;</h2> 
<p>New studies on goat milk show it is more beneficial to health than cow milk.
</p> 
<p>Research carried out at the Department of Physiology of the University of 
Granada (Universidad de Granada http://www.ugr.es) has revealed that goat milk 
has more beneficial properties to health than cow milk. Among these properties 
it helps to prevent ferropenic anaemia (iron deficiency) and bone 
demineralisation (softening of the bones).</p> 
<p>This project, conducted by Doctor Javier D&iacute;az Castro and directed by 
professors Margarita S&aacute;nchez Campos, Inmaculada L&oacute;pez Aliaga and 
Jos&eacute; Mu&ntilde;oz Alf&eacute;rez, focuses on the comparison between the 
nutritional properties of goat milk and cow milk, both with normal calcium 
content and calcium enriched, against the bioavailability of iron, calcium, 
phosphorus and magnesium. To carry out this study, the metabolic balance 
technique has been used both in rats with experimentally induced nutritional 
ferropenic anaemia and in a control group of rats.</p> 
<p>In order to know how the nutritive utilisation of these minerals may affect 
their metabolic distribution and destination, the UGR researcher has determined 
the concentration of these minerals in the different organs involved in their 
homeostatic regulation and different haematological parameters in relation to 
the metabolism of the minerals.</p> 
<p>Results obtained in the study reveal that ferropenic anaemia and bone 
demineralisation caused by this pathology have a better recovery with goat 
milk. Due to the higher bioavailability of iron, calcium, phosphorus and 
magnesium, the restoration of altered haematological parameters and the better 
levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that regulates the calcium 
balance in the organism was found in the rats that consumed this food.</p> 
<p>Javier D&iacute;az Castro points out that the inclusion of goat milk with 
normal or double calcium content in the diet &ldquo;favours digestive and 
metabolic utilisation of iron, calcium and phosphorus and their deposit in 
target organs &ndash; parts of the organism to which these minerals are 
preferably sent &ndash; involved in their homeostatic regulation&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>According to this researcher, all these conclusions reveal that regular 
consumption of goats&rsquo; milk &ndash; a natural food with highly beneficial 
nutritional characteristics &ndash; &ldquo;has positive effects on mineral 
metabolism, recovery from ferropenic anaemia and bone mineralisation in rats. 
In addition, and unlike observations in cow milk, its calcium enrichment does 
not interfere in the bioavailability of the minerals studied&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Although there is no doubt that these findings may be a base for further in 
depth study of the multiple health benefits of goat milk, the UGR 
(http://www.ugr.es) researcher warns that &ldquo;studies in humans are still 
required in order to confirm the findings obtained in rats and to promote 
goats&rsquo; milk consumption both in the general population and in the 
population affected by nutritional ferropenic anaemia and pathologies related 
to bone demineralisation&rdquo;. Part of the results of this research has been 
published in the prestigious scientific journals International Dairy Journal 
and Journal Dairy Science.</p>
