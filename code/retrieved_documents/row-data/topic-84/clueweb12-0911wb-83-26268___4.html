<dd> <strong>Mikki</strong> of The Not So Perfect Housewife says &ldquo;I was 
sent two packages of coffee&ndash; which are VERY cool looking. I quickly 
busted open the Organic Mind, Body &amp; Soul pack &ndash; it has &lsquo;notes 
of chocolate&rsquo; in it.. so of COURSE I would open that one first. SMOOTH 
and Yummylicious!&rdquo; Read her complete review.  Read more reviews </dd>

<h4>Why You Should Try Goat Milk Products</h4>

<p>Milk, cheese, yogurt, kefir&hellip; these are all products that come from 
cows, right? Well, while that&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s important to branch out 
and discover new things! Goats provide the same products with their dairy, and 
with a distinct taste and texture. Some may say that goat dairy is an acquired 
taste &ndash; if that&rsquo;s the case, the acquiring doesn&rsquo;t take very 
long! Try sprinkling goat cheese on a fresh, homemade pizza &ndash; delicious! 
Or drizzle goat yogurt over fresh berries with sweet honey and be amazed. We 
really likeLiberte &ndash;&nbsp;their goat yogurt is smooth, silky and full of 
sharp flavor. You may find that the creamy tartness of goat dairy is a better 
choice for many dishes.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And did you know that goats have just one stomach, unlike cows with their 
four? This means that the way goat milk is produced may result in easier 
digestion for us! If the lactose in pasteurized cow&rsquo;s milk gives you an 
upset stomach, try drinking goat&rsquo;s milk. You may like it better than 
lactose-free cow&rsquo;s milk. Goat&rsquo;s milk does contain lactose, like 
cow&rsquo;s milk. But it contains more vitamin A, Calcium, Potassium and 
Magnesium. And it is a great source of minerals and protein and it is low in 
fat.</p> 
<p>You can find goat&rsquo;s milk, cheese, yogurt and kefir in most grocery 
stores, but you might have to look around. For milk, yogurt and kefir, just 
look on the label for the word &ldquo;goat&rdquo;! For cheese, it may be a bit 
more difficult. Look for the words &ldquo;goat&rdquo;, &ldquo;chevre&rdquo; 
(French), or &ldquo;capra&rdquo; (Spanish). You can try it plain, with herbs, 
or in feta form. Just check the label to make sure that it is from a goat, not 
a cow. Some cheeses can have tricky labels. When in doubt, ask a fromager at 
the market when you are shopping. Look for unpasteurized for more complex, rich 
flavor.</p> 
<p>You can also try goat ice cream, goat butter, and goat buttermilk.</p> 
<p>Did you know that goat&rsquo;s milk is also cherished for its 
skin-improving benefits? We love Zum and Canus products.Zum goat-milk-based 
soaps are naturally pH-balanced with your skin, so you won&rsquo;t feel greasy 
or dry. And the healing properties of goat&rsquo;s milk are harnessed in pure 
lotion, soap and bubble bath products fromCanus. Pampering your skin and 
nourishing your body is completely natural with valuable goat&rsquo;s milk.</p>
