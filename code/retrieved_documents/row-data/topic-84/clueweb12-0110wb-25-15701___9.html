<br> 
<p>In general, only breastmilk or formula should be used if your baby is less 
than six months old.</p> 
<p>Between six and twelve months, supplementing with solids (instead of 
formula) or very small amounts of cow, goat, soy or rice milk is less of a 
problem, as long as baby is still nursing for the<i>majority</i> of milk intake 
and baby is not allergic. However, babies under a year are more at risk for 
allergic reactions (see below) so it can be a good idea to wait.</p> 
<p>After a year, other milks may be used, but are not needed (other sources 
provide the same nutrients). It's recommended that you limit the amount of 
cow's milk that your child receives (possibly other milks too,<i>except</i> 
breastmilk) to 2-3 cups (16-24 ounces) per day. Too much cow's milk in a 
child's diet can put him at risk for iron-deficiency anemia (because milk can 
interfere with the absorption of iron) and decrease the child's desire for 
other foods. More here oncow's milk after a year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> Cow's Milk <br>

<p>Use of cow's milk before a year is controversial among experts. You might 
want to get your baby's doctor's opinion on this.</p> 
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends NO cow's milk until after the 
first birthday.</p> 
<p>Cow's milk is more specific to a baby cow than a baby human. Cow's milk 
formula is based on cow's milk but has been engineered to be closer to human 
milk (still a ways off, but closer). Many infants still have problems with 
cow's milk formula (allergies, GI problems, etc.). Babies who are exposed to 
cow's milk before their first birthday are more likely to be anemic, have 
diarrhea or vomiting, and/or experience an allergic reaction (the proteins in 
milk are more numerous than those in other milk products, such as the yogurt). 
The excessive protein load in cow's milk can also overload a baby's kidneys. It 
is deficient in vitamins C, E, and copper. It is harder to digest as well, 
often causing intestinal blood loss. Anumber of studies have also indicated 
that early introduction of cow's milk may contribute to the development of 
Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus.</p> 
<p>Others see no problem with starting cow's milk toward the end of the first 
year unless there is a family history of allergy to it. Dr. Jack Newman, a 
renowned expert in the lactation field, is one of these. See theBreastmilk, 
cow's milk, formula, outside work and bottles section of his article 
&quot;Breastfeeding and Other Foods.&quot; Notice that he qualifies this advice 
with the importance of the baby being well-established on a variety of solids 
and continuing to be breastfed (both of which should help make up for what 
cow's milk can't offer at this age). He also suggests that supplemental milk of 
any kind is not all that necessary if the baby is allowed to nurse frequently 
when with mom. He suggests offering the baby solid foods with some water or 
small amounts of juice instead.</p> 
<p><b>Yogurt and cheese</b></p> 
<p>Some experts consider yogurt and cheese to be okay for most babies after 6 
months. Others prefer waiting until 9-12 months. Of course, if baby has a cow's 
milk allergy or there is a strong history of allergy to cow's milk in the 
family, yogurt, cheese and all other foods made with cow's milk should be 
avoided until 12 months or later. The main difference between yogurt and milk 
is that the lactose in yogurt has been converted into lactic acid. Cheese 
differs from milk in two ways: the whey proteins are drained off in the 
cheese-making process (so only casein proteins remain), and the curdling 
enzymes break down the casein proteins into smaller protein molecules. For 
babies and toddlers, try to find the whole milk yogurt (not low or no fat), and 
avoid the yogurt with artificial sweeteners lots of sugary fruits.</p>

</p> Goat's Milk <br>

<p>Using goat's milk before 6 months or regular use between 6 and 12 months is 
not recommended. Goat's milk is no more appropriate to give baby than cow's 
milk. If you need to supplement and breastmilk is not available, formulas are a 
more nutritionally complete product. There are several comparisons of goat vs. 
cow vs. human milk in the links below. Using this information, goat milk is 
much closer in composition to cow milk than human milk. Goat's milk is high in 
sodium (like cow's milk) and is very high in chloride and potassium, which 
makes the renal solute load too high for babies. This can cause 
gastrointestinal bleeding and can result in anemia and poor growth (these 
problems are usually undetected until months later). Goat milk is also 
deficient in folic acid, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Also, infants 
who are allergic to cow's milk protein are often allergic to goat's milk too.
</p> 
<p>While it's true that whole goats milk (and whole cow's milk) was commonly 
used prior to the advent of infant formulas it is also true that the infant 
mortality and morbidity rate during the times of such substitutions was very 
high.<br>
