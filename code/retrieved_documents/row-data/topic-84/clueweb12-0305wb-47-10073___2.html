 Natural Goat&#146;s Milk Nutrition<br>

<p><b>Premium Goat-Milk Protein</b></p> 
<p><b>What is CaProtein?<br>
</b><br>
 Caprotein is a premium quality 
goat-milk protein powder. It is minimally processed by Mt. Capra from goat milk 
collected from our own farms to preserve it&#146;s original composition. Most 
other milk protein powders are made from cow milk and use several harsh 
processing steps including heating at high temperature. Caprotein contains all 
essential amino acids for optimal health and is tolerated well by most people. 
Caprotein is partially predigested (lacto-fermented). This process assist 
digestion and absorption while providing the body with beneficial probiotics 
and enzymes.<br>
<br>
<b>Why Caprotein?</b> <br>
<br>
 Caprotein is the highest 
quality goat-milk protein powder available. It is made from goats-milk that 
contains no antibiotics or growth hormones. Caprotein is high in amino acids 
and is a complete protein source. These building blocks of protein are crucial 
for optimal health. Caprotein provides a balanced combination of whey protein 
and milk protein. Most animal protein supplements (from cows milk) only provide 
one part of the proteins found in milk. We at Mt. Capra are convinced that a 
combination of milk protein and whey protein is superior. Caprotein also 
provides a favorable ratio of potassium to sodium.<br>
