<h1>Goat Milk?<br>
Discover the Healing Power of Goat Milk<br>
By Daniel 
Madock, DC, American Chiropractic Association Magazine</h1> 
<p><br>
<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Doctors of chiropractic have long been advocates of transforming health 
from the inside out. As we seek to better our patients&#146; health, there is 
one particular healing food that has been revered for centuries: goat milk and 
goat-milk-derived products.</p> 
<p>Goat milk has extensive healing properties. Research shows that goat milk 
has better digestibility, buffering capacity and alkalinity than cow milk.1,12 
Several properties testify to the superiority of goat milk. First, goat milk 
biologically resembles human milk. Second, goat milk contains a low level of 
allergy-producing substances. Third, it digests quickly and absorbs completely. 
Last, goat milk is an alkaline powerhouse.</p> 
<h2>Biological Resemblance to Human Milk:</h2> 
<p><b>Goat milk has a similarity to human milk that is unmatched in bovine 
(cow) milk, which may be at the root of goat milk&#146;s healing properties.</b>
 A study by the International Journal of Food Science Nutrition found that 
&quot;goat milk has a very different profile of the non-protein nitrogen 
fraction to cow milk, with several constituents such as nucleotides (DNA 
structure) having concentrations approaching those in human breast milk&quot;.2 
So at the very base of the DNA structure of goat milk are similarities to the 
DNA structure of human milk. Another study concluded, &quot;The oligosaccharide 
(prebiotic) profile of goat milk is most similar to that of human milk.&quot;3 
The same study went on to state, &quot;Goat milk oligosaccharides could be 
included in infant formulas to improve the nutrition of infants.&quot;3 These 
prebiotics are on the cutting edge of digestive health.</p> 
<p><b>Goat milk also resembles human milk in the protein structure.</b> Beta 
casein, the major casein protein found in both goat and human milk, is 
different from the casein found in cow milk.4&nbsp; Also, the peptide mappings 
of these alpha-lacto albumins and beta-lacto globulins in goat and human milk 
are completely different from those of cow milk.4 Another publication found 
that the micelle structures of the casein between human and goat milk had a 
prevalence of beta casein unmatched in cow milk.13 Furthermore, &quot;...milk 
samples from women and goats were found to contain significantly higher 
concentrations of selenium than samples from cows.&quot;5</p> 
<h2>Low Level of Allergy-Producing Substances:</h2> 
<p><b>Perhaps one of goat milk&#146;s most famous attributes, low 
allergenicity, is vital to keeping each patient in optimum health.</b> Cow milk 
allergy is<i>the</i> No. 1 allergy of children, affecting roughly 500,000 to 
1.5 million children every year.6 Cow milk contains more than 20 allergen 
proteins,4 which are not recognized by the immune system and are targeted in 
ways that cause a variety of symptoms. Hives, wheezing, vomiting, abdominal 
cramping, diarrhea, skin rash (commonly near and around the mouth), runny nose, 
watery eyes, colic in infants and even anaphylactic shock can all be signs and 
symptoms of a cow milk allergy.</p> 
<p><b>Evidence points, however, to the lower allergic potential of goat milk 
when compared with cow milk.</b>4, 6, 9 One study found that nearly 93 percent 
of infants suffering from cow milk allergies were able to tolerate and thrive 
on goat milk.7 Another animal model study concluded that &quot;goat milk, when 
used as the first source of protein after a breastfeeding period, is less 
allergenic than cow milk.&quot;8 Alphas1 casein is one of the main allergens in 
cow milk. Goat milk, like human milk, contains low levels of 
allergy-causingalphas1 casein and high levels of alphas2 casein, which is 
non-allergy-causing.</p> 
<p>Allergies to foods such as cow milk also affect adults. Often these 
allergies do not manifest themselves immediately in adults. It is common for 
adult allergies to cause latent discomfort, pain, damage and overall lack of 
wellness. Cow milk should always be lined up as one of the usual suspects when 
investigating food intolerances in patients. While soy milk has been touted as 
a safe alternative to cow milk, some studies show that those with a cow milk 
allergy have a 47-percent chance of also being allergic to soy milk.10</p> 
<h2>Rapid Digestion and Complete Absorption:</h2> 
<p>Digestion is defined as catabolism (break-down) of food into elemental food 
particles (fats, proteins, carbohydrates) in the stomach, while absorption is 
the uptake of the food particles in the small intestine.<b>Goat milk has better 
digestibility and absorption than cow milk for several reasons.</b>1 When the 
physicochemical make-up of these two milks are compared, a stark difference in 
the amount of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and medium-chain fatty acids 
(MCFA) arises. Goat milk is much higher in SCFA and MCFA than cow milk. This 
means that those SCFA and MCFA have a larger surface-to-volume ratio and are 
better digested and absorbed than the long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) prevalent 
in cow milk.11 In fact, a recent study found that &#147;levels of the 
metabolically valuable short- and medium-chain fatty acids&#151;caproic, 
caprylic, capric and lauric&#151;are significantly higher in...goat (milk) than 
in cow milk.&#148;12 These higher levels of easy-to-digest SCFA and MCFA are 
broken down quicker and more completely than the LCFA abundant in cow milk.</p> 
<p><b>Goat milk also contains proteins that digest in a superior manner.</b> A 
study investigating the effect of pepsin and trypsin (two protein-digesting 
enzymes found in the stomach) revealed that while these enzymes completely 
digested over 96 percent of available goat milk protein, less than 73 percent 
of available cow milk protein was able to be digested completely.13 <b>In 
addition to highly digestible protein, goat milk contains far more 
digestion-friendly oligosaccharides (prebiotics).</b>14 Goat milk also has an 
abundance of the energy substrate adenosine triphosphate(ATP) that far exceeds 
bovine milk.15 ATP is the energy &#147;currency&#148; that our metabolism is 
constantly manufacturing, used for every cellular reaction in the body.</p> 
<h2>Alkaline Powerhouse:</h2> 
<p>Many foods cause the body to become acidic, which can lead to a host of 
health issues.16 An accurate way to indicate if a food is acid-forming, is to 
examine its buffering capacity, or rather its ability to reduce acid load. A 
study from the<i> Journal of Dairy Science</i> examined the buffering capacity 
of goat milk, cow milk, soy milk and antacid drugs. Now, in theory, the antacid 
drugs should have proven to have the best buffering capacity since their 
function is to reduce acid. However,<b>the study found that goat milk 
overwhelmingly exceeded the buffering capabilities of the other three samples 
tested.</b>1 Another study in the <i>Journal of Nutrition</i> found that <b>
oligosaccharides (prebiotics) from goat milk very likely play a major role in 
intestinal protection and repair.</b>17 This is important because acidic diets 
often cause damage to the gastrointestinal lining. Practitioners would be wise 
to use alkalizing goat milk products to help patients with acidic GI tracts.</p>
<p>As chiropractors, we must keep ourselves on the cutting edge of nutritional 
supplementation. Isn&#146;t it time you started healing with goat milk?</p> 
<h2>ACA News Extra... Health Implications: Now What?</h2> 
<p>For the past 30 years, I have been using and recommending a goat-milk-based 
mineral/electrolyte supplement known asCapra Mineral Whey. This supplement is 
produced by Mt. Capra Wholefood Nutritionals, a unique company that has its own 
farm (complete with free-range goats) and a separate FDA-approved processing 
facility).</p> 
<p>Goat milk is a very fragile and time-sensitive product, so Mt. Capra has 
developed a proprietary system for gently drying the goat milk to preserve its 
bioavailability. It has an entire product line devoted to wellness-enhancing 
products sourced from goat milk.</p> 
<p>In addition to the mineral whey, Mt. Capra offers a whole protein 
supplement known as CaProtein, which combines natural ratios of goat milk whey 
and casein protein to stimulate lean body (muscle) growth. Mt. Capra also 
supplies goat milk colostrum (CapraColostrum) and probiotics (CaproBiotics) for 
enhanced immune and digestive support, as well as CapraFlex, which targets bone 
and joint health.</p> <br>
