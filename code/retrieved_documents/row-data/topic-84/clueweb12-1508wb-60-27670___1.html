<h1>Drugged up on milk</h1> <br>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything more tainted than a glass of water, it&rsquo;s 
store-bought milk.</p> 
<p>The pasteurization process that&rsquo;s supposed to make milk 
&ldquo;safe&rdquo; robs it of all nutrition while doing zilch to break down all 
the drugs, hormones and other chemicals secretly (and illegally) given to dairy 
cows.</p> 
<p>And believe me, those things are in your milk &mdash; the only reason 
it&rsquo;s not common knowledge is that we don&rsquo;t actually test for most 
of them.</p> 
<p>Researchers in Europe stepped in where governments have failed and ran 
their own tests on samples of goat, cow and even human breast milk &mdash; and 
of the three, they found that &ldquo;wholesome&rdquo; moo juice was packed with 
the most drugs and hormones.</p> 
<p>They found painkillers, antibiotics, steroids, sex hormones, anti-malaria 
meds and more, and wrote in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry that 
up to 20 different contaminants can be floating around inside a single glass of 
milk.</p> 
<p>Think that can&rsquo;t possibly be true here, in the good old U.S. of 
dAiry? Think again: The FDA tried to pull some very limited milk samples for 
extra tests earlier this year, and the dairy industry practically started a 
riot.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to wonder what they&rsquo;re so afraid of.</p> 
<p>Needless to say, no milk was tested &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t expect that 
to change anytime soon.</p> 
<p>But I don&rsquo;t need a test result to know our milk is filthy. Just look 
at the facts: Dairy cows eventually become hamburger&hellip; and drugs banned 
from milk have been turning up in that dairy hamburger.</p> 
<p>How&rsquo;d they get in there? Give you one guess &mdash; but since farmers 
know that milk isn&rsquo;t actually tested for those banned drugs, 
they&rsquo;re confident they can break a few rules along the way and no one 
will ever know.</p> 
<p>But now you know.</p> 
<p>If you love your milk, you don&rsquo;t have to give it up &mdash; just make 
a permanent switch to farm-fresh organic raw milk. Search online or call a 
local dairy farm to find out how.</p> <br>
