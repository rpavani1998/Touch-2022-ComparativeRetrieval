<h2>The dangers of so-called dairy-free ice cream</h2> September 28, 2011 By 
Michelle 4 Comments <br>

<p>There has long been a disconnect between terminology used by 
&lsquo;experts&rsquo; and common parlance and for the most part this is a 
matter for humour rather than concern. But occasionally the disconnect can lead 
to confusion which can not only be dangerous but life threatening &ndash; and 
such is the case in the allergy world.</p> 
<p>The term &lsquo;allergy&rsquo; itself is interpreted very differently by 
the medical profession and the average man or woman in the street (more of this 
anon&hellip;) but &lsquo;drilling down&rsquo; to specific allergies, the 
situation just become muddier. Take &lsquo;dairy-free&rsquo;, highlighted with 
reference to &lsquo;ice cream&rsquo;, on page 7 of &nbsp;the Food Standards 
Agency&rsquo;s most recentnewsletter.</p> 
<p>To the average punter &ndash; well certainly to me &ndash; 
&lsquo;dairy-free&rsquo; would suggest free of the milk of all animals. No 
particularly good reason, but it just seems logical. But no, &lsquo;dairy 
free&rsquo; only refers to cow&rsquo;s milk &nbsp;&ndash; so goat&rsquo;s milk 
or buffalo milk is, technically &lsquo;dairy-free&rsquo; even though it may 
have been &lsquo;milked&rsquo; in a dairy&hellip; This could have implications 
for someone who was allergic to all animal milks (a not uncommon situation) but 
did not realise that a product marked &lsquo;dairy free&rsquo; might contain 
goat, sheep or buffalo milk to which they could also react.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And then there is &lsquo;milk&rsquo;. To most people, milk is white and 
liquid and goes on cereals and in your tea. Whether it comes from a cow, a 
goat, a soya bean, an oat or a coconut, it looks the same and is, largely, used 
for the same purpose. So, would not the simplest way to differentiate between 
the different &lsquo;milks&rsquo; be to require that they specify their origin 
e.g. cow&rsquo;s milk, goat&rsquo;s milk, soya milk, oat milk etc &ndash; which 
is how they are referred to in common parlance anyhow. But no. The term 
&lsquo;milk&rsquo; can only be used in reference to the milk of mammals &ndash; 
cows, goats, camels, humans etc. &lsquo;Milk&rsquo; made from anything else (a 
bean, a nut, a hemp seed) has to be referred to as a &lsquo;dairy-free 
alternative to milk&rsquo; or as an almond or soya &lsquo;drink&rsquo;. Clumsy 
and inelegant as this may be, it does at least describe what is in the pack. 
But the situation with &lsquo;ice cream&rsquo; is more risky.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As with milk, to the average punter an ice cream is a sweet food that is 
creamy and frozen, whether it is made from cow&rsquo;s milk/cream, goat&rsquo;s 
milk, soya, coconut or, as is the case with many of the cheaper ice creams, 
mainly from vegetable fats. They recognise the concept rather than the 
ingredients. So surely, as with milk, the trick would be to require the 
manufacturer to specify the origin of the product &ndash; cow&rsquo;s milk ice 
cream, goat&rsquo;s milk ice cream, soya ice cream, rice-based ice cream. But 
no &ndash; the term &lsquo;ice cream&rsquo; can only, according to the Food 
Labelling Regulation 1996, be used for a product which contains a minimum of 
2.5% milk protein. So no matter how creamy, decadent and delicious 
&lsquo;alternative ice creams&rsquo; may be, they all have to be called 
&lsquo;frozen desserts&rsquo; or &lsquo;dairy-free frozen desserts&rsquo; (both 
of which could equally well refer to a cheesecake) or opt for some way out and 
totally unhelpful name such as BoojaBooja&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stuff in a Tub&rsquo;.
</p> 
<p>Again, this is clunky and irritating but relatively harmless. Much less so 
is the possibility, highlighted by the FSA, that some manufacturers may make 
frozen ice cream-like products from dairy-free ingredients (such as soya) which 
would be safe for someone who was allergic/intolerant to animal milks, but 
include the minimum required amount of dairy protein (2.5%) to be allowed to 
call them &lsquo;ice creams&rsquo; &ndash; so marketing them as 
&lsquo;Dairy-free ice creams&rsquo;. &nbsp;In the extremely unlikely event that 
you were familiar with the arcane intricacies of labeling law, your antenna 
would prick up when you saw &lsquo;dairy-free&rsquo; and &lsquo;ice 
cream&rsquo; together in the same title, but a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; dairy 
allergic/intolerant person should reasonably expect a product that is labelled 
&lsquo;dairy free&rsquo; to be just that. Yet, 2.5% milk protein in a food 
could cause a dramatic, potentially even fatal, reaction in someone who was 
seriously allergic.</p> 
<p>Of course it is easy to carp and I am well aware that drawing up these 
kinds of regulation is a nightmare job but I cannot help feel that, especially 
in this area, we are making our lives unnecessarily complicated and creating 
even more unwelcome hazards for those who have a problem with animal milks.</p>
