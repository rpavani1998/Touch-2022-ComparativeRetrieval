<h1>Kefir &amp; Milk<br>
Health Benefits of Goat Milk</h1> 
<h2>For Better Health Drink Goat Milk</h2> 
<p>Goat milk is a natural for anyone looking for ease of digestion, maximum 
nutrition and excellent health from their dairy. It is recognized as one of the 
&#147;must have&#148; superfoods of the healthful Mediterranean Diet AND people 
living in &#147;Blue Zones&#148;, regions of the world where people commonly 
live active lives pas the age of 100 years!</p> 
<h3>Doctor Recommended</h3> 
<p>According to Dr. Oz, &#147;America&#146;s Doctor&#148;, host of the Dr. Oz 
Show and Vice-chair and Professor of Surgery at Columbia University: 
&#147;Sardinians&#133; (one Blue Zone population) drink goat milk which is high 
in calcium and good for your heart. Plus, researchers believe it could protect 
against Alzheimer&#146;s and heart disease.&#148;</p> 
<p>It has more easily digestible, short and middle chain fats and protein 
solids than cow milk and may be enjoyed by many people who are lactose 
intolerant. The increased digestibility of protein is important for infants and 
children. In addition, goat milk is higher in calcium and vitamin A than cow 
milk and the natural buffering qualities of goat milk make it beneficial for 
people with ulcers and other stomach problems.</p> 
<h3>Casein in Goat Milk<br>
</h3> 
<p>Casein is a natural protein that is found in all milk.&nbsp; Many people 
have difficulty with Casein especially the Alpha S1 casein found in cow milk 
and so are allergic to cow dairy.&nbsp; Studies have shown that goat milk is 
very low in Alpha S1 casein and primarily contains Alpha S2 casein.&nbsp; That 
is why those allergic to cow dairy can use goat milk products in their diets 
successfully.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Naturally Homogenized</h3> 
<p>Because of the smaller fat particles contained in GOAT MILK, as compared to 
cow milk, it&nbsp; is considered to be &#147;naturally homogenized&#148; and 
from a health standpoint this is deemed much better than mechanically 
homogenized milk. We do not homogenize or standardize our goat milk.</p> 
<h3>No rBST</h3> 
<p>We do not believe in the use of hormones to increase milk production in our 
animals and fortunately, these hormones were never developed for dairy 
goats.&nbsp; When you choose goat milk or any goat milk product for yourself 
and your family, do so with confidence.</p> <br>
