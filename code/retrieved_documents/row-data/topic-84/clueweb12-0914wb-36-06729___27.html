<h2>Nutritional Value Of Dairy Products Of Ewe And Goat Milk</h2> 
<p>By<br>
George F. W. Haenlein Cooperative Extension Dairy Specialist 
University of Delaware</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>SUMMARY </h2> 
<p>The composition of ewe and goat milks varies over a wide range because of 
genetic differences between species, between breeds within species and within 
breeds. These genetic differences have considerable influences on the 
cheese-making process and on human digestion of these milks. Furthermore, the 
stage of lactation, daily variation, season, parity, type of diet, 
physiological status, health of the udder and processing procedures change the 
contents and levels of major and minor constituents in the milks and its 
products. This provides, therefore, considerable potential to tailor-make ewe 
and goat milks according to the needs and preferences of consumers, and to 
provide an alternative to cow's milk, where this is economically or medically 
advantageous. But more research documentation is needed in this area.</p> 
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>The aim of this paper is to focus on properties and attributes of the milk 
and dairy products from ewes and goats as they contribute to human nutrition.
</p> 
<p>The composition of the milk of ewes and goats and factors affecting it has 
been reviewed comprehensively (Parkash &amp; Jenness, 1968; Jenness, 1980; 
Anifantakis, 1986; Juarez &amp; Ramos, 1986). Further important contributions 
have been published by Anifantakis et al. (1980), Merin et al. (1988), Casoli 
et al. (1989), Voutsinas et al. (1990), Espie &amp; Mullan (1990), Simos et. 
al. (1991), Haenlein (1992), Peeters, et al. (1992), Park (1992; 1994), Sakul 
&amp; Boylan (1992), Agnihotri &amp; Prasad (1993), Bindal &amp; Wadhwa (1993), 
Quiles et al. (1994), O'Connor (1994), Kalantzopoulos (1994) among others. 
However, only a few deal with the relation to human nutritional needs, which 
has been pointed out by Charlet (1981) &quot;...the variation of composition of 
milk has not received the attention it deserves, except by a few workers&quot;. 
This is still largely true today and a 1st World Congress of Dairy Products in 
Human Health and Nutrition gave ewe and goat milk no recognition and deserved 
coverage, when it was held in Spain in 1993 (Serrano Rios et al., 1994).</p> 
<p>Interest in the original properties of milk, as it comes from the farm, 
should be high, when it is consumed as fluid whole milk, partly skimmed or as 
yogurt. Dairy products, mainly cheeses (except those made from whey) contain 
only the casein and fat fractions of milk, but no whey proteins, nor lactose 
and soluble minerals, so interest may be limited here to the original 
composition of casein and fat only, and changes during cheese fermentation. Ewe 
milk, depending on region and economic conditions, is mostly processed into 
cheeses and yogurt. Goat milk on the other hand, in some countries, is consumed 
as fluid milk, even on a commercial basis, besides being processed into dairy 
products. Therefore, the characteristics of all components of goat milk are of 
considerable market interest.</p> 
<p>Interest in the nutritive value of ewe milk is concerned mostly with the 
yield and evaluation of its cheeses and yogurt. Interest in the nutritive value 
of goat milk includes all fractions and how they may differ from those in the 
milk of other species. In order to sell goat and ewe milks and their products 
for human consumption, their needs and tastes, it is of considerable market 
advantage to know the factors that cause milk composition to vary and to what 
extend. This will be even more important in the future, when it becomes better 
known how to change original farm milk composition by manipulating e.g. the 
feeding of goats and ewes in order to tailor-make milk to the needs of diet 
conscious and disease afflicted consumers and their children, and to satisfy 
consumers with higher incomes, who have developed a sophisticated connoisseur 
taste for goat and ewe milk products.</p> 
<p>Ewe and goat milk has considerable economic importance in some countries. 
The Mediterranean region produces 66 percent of the world's ewe milk (Table 1) 
and 18 percent of the world's goats milk (Table 2) (FAO, 1994). Of all milk 
produced by cows, buffaloes, ewes and goats combined, ewe milk makes up 1.5 
percent and goat milk 2.0 percent of the world total, but in the Mediterranean 
region it is 11.7 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. In at least 7 
countries, including Greece, ewe milk or goat milk is more than 20 percent of 
all milk produced; and in at least 10 countries the combined production of ewe 
and goat milk is more than 20 percent of all milk in that country (Table 3 and 
4) (FAO, 1994). Some countries, including Greece, have more than 1 ewe and goat 
combined per person (Table 3) and at least half of the countries with leading 
ewe and goat populations have more than 1 ewe and goat combined per hectare 
permanent pasture land, again Greece included.</p> 
<p>The significance of ewe and goat milk for human nutrition in these 
countries varies widely (Table 4) from less than 5 kg all milk per person per 
year to more than 450 kg, assuming that the FAO statistics, which are very 
difficult to obtain in some countries, approximate the real conditions. The 
food supply for protein or calcium from all animal sources, including milk and 
dairy products, also varies greatly between these countries (Table 4), and 
averages in many countries far below the minimum daily requirements of 65 g 
protein and 800 mg calcium (NRC, 1968). This gives much support to the 
contention that improved ewe and goat milk production is one of the best 
strategies to relieve human starvation, undernutrition and malnutrition and 
therefore has great market growth potential, incentive and justification, 
especially in areas where pasture conditions, climate, mountainous terrain and 
economic conditions favor small ruminants.</p> 
<p>The market of ewe and goat milks and their products has essentially three 
aspects:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>home consumption and self-sufficiency, </li> 
<li>gourmet menus and natural foods preference, </li> 
<li>medical needs. </li> </ol> 
<p>Knowledge of the nutritive values of ewe and goat milks, what causes them 
to be different or to change, and comparison with cow's and human milks will 
help each of these markets. Some evidence from recent research with ewes and 
goats comprises this review.</p> 
<h2>FACTORS AFFECTING MILK COMPOSITION</h2> 
<h3>GENETICS</h3> 
<p>Average genetic composition differences between species, ewe versus goat 
versus cow, and compared to human milk are considerable (Posati &amp; Orr, 
1976) in absolute and relative terms (Table 5, 6). Ewe milk is generally much 
higher in solids contents than goat, cow's or human milks, but composition 
categories and contents of individual minerals, fatty acids and amino acids 
vary in different directions between the species, and without relation to 
higher or lower solids contents. The high solids content of ewe milk makes it 
generally superior to goat or cow milk for processing into cheese and yogurt, 
because of higher yield and firmer processing quality without additives. 
However, this must be balanced in economic terms against lactation milk yield 
and lactation length of milking ewes, which is much less and shorter than for 
goats or cows. Nevertheless, published average data of milk of different 
species have to be used with caution, because within each species there are 
great genetic differences due to breeds and selected families, which can be 
used to market advantage.</p> 
<p>Genetic differences in milk composition within species have a wide range 
for ewe milk fat from 4.6 percent to 12.6 percent (Casoli et al., 1989) and an 
average of 7.1 percent (Anifantakis, 1986); for ewe milk protein from 4.8 to 
7.2 percent and an average of 5.7 percent, depending on breed. Other components 
follow these ranges. It must be emphasized that cow's milks, when ewe or goat 
milks are compared with them, also have a wide composition range due to breeds, 
e.g. average Holstein milk fat at 3.4 percent versus average Jersey milk fat at 
5.1 percent, and milk protein from 3.3 percent to 3.9 percent (Anifantakis, 
1986), besides other breeds. Goat milk composition likewise can have great 
differences, depending on breed, e.g. for milk fat from 2.3 percent to 6.9 
percent (Juarez, 1986) and an average of 3.3 percent; for goat milk protein 
from 2.2 percent to 5.1 percent and an average of 3.4 percent. A major portion 
of this variation includes negative correlations between milk yield and 
composition, i.e. low yields have higher contents and vice versa.</p> 
<p>Within species within breed one can identify through selective breeding 
considerable differences in milk composition. This includes genetic 
polymorphisms of milk proteins, which have commercial importance in cheese 
making, because they influence rennetability, cheese yield and flavor (Remeuf 
&amp; Lenoir, 1986; Martin, 1993; Chianese et al., 1993; Heil &amp; Dumont, 
1993; Kalantzopoulos, 1994), and which have potential but yet poorly understood 
values in human nutrition (Haenlein, 1991). Genetic polymorphisms of 
beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-s-1-, beta- and kappa-casein affect firmness and 
viscosity of yogurt, rennet coagulation time, curd syneresis, heat stability, 
contents of casein, total solids, phosphorus and pH. Amino acid substitutions 
have been identified for the DNA sequences of caprine, ovine and bovine milk 
protein genes (Martin, 1993; Folch et al., 1994) and have been related to the 
different behavior of milk proteins in processing.</p> 
<p>Some goat milk has low casein contents and unsatisfactory rennet 
coagulation ability, which affects cheese yield (Remeuf &amp; Lenoir, 1986; 
Ambrosoli et al., 1988). Goat milk casein has the same four proteins, 
alpha-s-1, alpha-s-2, beta and kappa, as cow's milk casein, but genetic 
differences by breeds and individuals in alpha-s-1 casein range quantitatively 
from zero or &quot;null type&quot; ( O ) to &quot;low types&quot; ( F, D ) and 
&quot;very high types&quot; ( A, B, C ), with intermediate classes ( E ). Some 
goat and sheep breeds differ significantly in the frequencies of the 
polymorphic loci of milk protein types (Jordana et al., 1995) (Table 7), with 
considerable processing and nutritional consequences. Low alpha-s-1 casein 
types of goat milk have shorter coagulation time and weaker resistance to heat 
treatment than high types. Curd firmness at 30 minutes of high type milk is 
greater than that of low type milk. Contents of total solids, total proteins, 
casein and phosphorus are higher in high type milk and pH is lower. Longer 
coagulation time of high type goat milk is due to alpha-s-1-casein delaying 
curd formation by trapping calcium ions and withdrawing them from the 
proteolysis of kappa casein. High type has higher cheese yield, better curd 
firmness, which is associated with lower pH. Despite longer coagulation time, 
goat milk of the high alpha-s-1 casein type is more suitable for cheese making 
because of firmer curd, higher casein content, less intense goat flavor and 
smoother cheese texture, yet it may be that low type has the advantage in human 
digestion. Beta-casein types also affect cheese making properties of goat milk 
(Chianese et al., 1993) and alpha-s-1- and beta-casein loci need to be 
considered together in selection. Sheep's milk also has polymorphisms in its 
milk proteins, but this research is just beginning.</p> 
<p>Amino acid substitutions in milk proteins can also be responsible for 
flavor and its intensity (Rystad et al., 1990). The amino acid threonine is 
considered the most important precursor of acetaldehyde, which is the main 
volatile aroma compound in yogurt. The higher level of glycine in goat milk 
compared to other species milks may reduce acetaldehyde production from 
threonine by inhibiting the enzyme threonine aldolase. Ultrafiltration removal 
of glycine increased acetaldehyde production in goat milk. Addition of 
threonine resulted in increased acetaldehyde production in goat or cow's milk, 
but goat milk had less. Goat milk with added threonine had less production of 
lactic, more pyruvic, acetic and less orotic acids; and there are other amino 
acid differences between goat and cow's milk (Rystad et al., 1990).</p> 
<h3>STAGE OF LACTATION</h3> 
<p>Within species within breed it is the stage of lactation, regardless of 
species or breed that has the greatest influence on milk composition. Days in 
milk during lactation regressed on ewe milk component contents had coefficients 
up to 0.71 (Casoli et al., 1989). Many components in ewe or goat milk as in 
cow's milk, especially fat and protein, are high in colostrum in early 
lactation, much lower thereafter until they rise again markedly at the end of 
lactation, when yields are low (Anifantakis &amp; Kandarakis, 1980). Fat 
contents in goat milk changed from 2.7 percent in mid-lactation to 4.6 percent 
during the last week 42 of lactation, protein contents from 3.0 percent to 4.2 
percent (Voutsinas et al., 1990). Mineral contents also increased with stage of 
lactation, Ca from 135 to 150 mg/100 g; P from 99 to 122; Na from 50 to 56; Mg 
13 to 15; except K decreased from 170 to 144; and citrate from 145 to 81 mg/100 
g.</p> 
<h3>DAILY VARIATION</h3> 
<p>Between morning and evening milkings on the same day the gross composition 
of milk may also change (Simos et al., 1991), which again may be confounded 
with milk yield levels, when the milking interval between evening and morning 
milking has more or less hours than between morning and evening milking. Fat 
contents of evening goat milk averaged 5.1 percent after 14 hours of milking 
interval, morning milk 5.3 percent after 10 hours, total protein contents were 
3.54 percent versus 3.58 percent, and total solids were 13.94 percent versus 
14.30 percent, respectively. In studies with milking intervals of 8 and 16 
hours the differences were 0.39 percent fat and 0.05 percent protein, 
respectively (Merin et al., 1988).</p> 
<h3>SEASON</h3> 
<p>There are also clear seasonal differences in milk composition of the major 
and minor components (Renner, 1982), but they are confounded with climate and 
diet effects. Winter climate can affect milk yields and composition, and both 
are negatively correlated. Winter feeding is providing usually different 
proportions and qualities of grazing, hays, silage and supplements, which 
influence milk composition considerably. Milk C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3 fatty 
acids have been found to increase in summer, while C4 to C16 fatty acids were 
reduced significantly. The seasonally limited production of ewe and goat milk 
has stimulated interest in overcoming this handicap by various means, including 
hormonal induction of lactation (Alifakiotis et al., 1980). Normal milk 
contents of fat, lactose, chloride, total solids, acidity and pH have been 
obtained.</p> 
<h3>PARITY</h3> 
<p>Differences due to parity, number of lactation or age of animal can be 
significant in gross milk composition, but this is also confounded with milk 
yield levels (Casoli et al., 1989). Average fat contents of ewe milk changed 
linearly from 1st to 6th parity from 6.8 percent to 7.4 percent and total 
protein contents from 5.8 percent to 6.2 percent for the Massese breed in 
Italy. Parity seems to have little effect on contents of amino acids, fatty 
acids or minerals (Casoli et al., 1989).</p> 
<h3>TYPE OF DIET AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS</h3> 
<p>Regardless of genetics, the composition of the daily diet and its amount in 
relation to production requirements can cause significant changes in milk 
composition (Moran-Fehr, 1981; Haenlein, 1995). In general terms, 3 percent of 
bodyweight is a minimum requirement of daily dry matter intake for most goats, 
but high producers will need at least 5 percent. In order to cover nutrient 
needs of high production, the energy and protein density of the daily feed 
intake must increase, because of the limitation of the rumen in volume 
capacity. Roughages like grass, hay or silages are mostly low in energy and 
protein density because of high fiber and/or water contents. Starchy 
supplements like cereal grains or fats and fatty seeds from sunflowers or 
roasted soybeans increase the energy density of the daily diet, and oil meals 
increase the protein density. Goats and ewe like other ruminants require a 
daily minimum of long fiber in the diet to prevent acidotic rumen conditions, 
which lead to fatal parakeratosis and enterotoxemia, or at least to laminitis, 
significantly depressed milk fat contents, but also possibly increased milk 
protein contents (Merin et al., 1988).</p> 
<p>A more intensive feeding system can be appropriately devised with a 
complete diet of hay, silage and concentrates mixed together loose (TMR, Total 
Mixed Ration) or in a pelleted or cubed form (Cavani et al., 1991). This causes 
usually higher milk yields, changes in milk fat and protein contents and also 
different cheese making properties.</p> 
<p>Energy shortage in the diet can change the fatty acid composition of milk 
fat towards more medium-chain fatty acids, while daily milk yield may decrease 
and fat content increase (Moran-Fehr, 1981). When grain concentrate 
supplementation makes up more than 50 percent of the daily dry matter intake by 
goats, decreased chewing, less rumination and a shortage of salivation of rumen 
contents occurs (Kawas et al., 1991). To prevent a decreased rumen pH, the 
feeding of buffers like sodium bicarbonate and magnesium oxide is beneficial. 
This has been shown in several studies, where yields were even increased while 
restoring milk fat contents to normal levels (Hadjipanayiotou, 1988). 
Increasing energy density by adding fat within narrow limits to the diet, can 
increase yield of milk, fat, total protein and casein contents (Moran-Fehr, 
1981). Also the type of protein in the diet and its rumen degradability can 
affect milk yield, contents of fat, protein, and processing properties 
(Andrighetto &amp; Bailoni, 1994).</p> 
<p>Nutritional physiology and endocrine status of the animal affects milk 
yield and composition over short or longer time periods. This has been 
demonstrated for the effect of estrogens during estrus (Haenlein &amp; Krauss, 
1974). Somatotropin also will increase milk yield, milk fat content, 
short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids significantly, while decreasing milk 
protein percentage, long-chain fatty acids and net energy balance (Disenhaus et 
al., 1995).</p> 
<h3>UDDER HEALTH</h3> 
<p>A widely accepted rapid monitor of udder health is the somatic cell count 
in milk. However, milk secretion in goats is apocrine, while in cows it is 
merocrine, which explains why goat milk may have very high counts of somatic 
cells, especially in late lactation milk or in the last strippings of milk, 
without any relationship to mastitis (Park &amp; Humphrey, 1986; Haenlein, 
1993). In cow's milk it has been demonstrated that the relative and absolute 
casein content is related negatively to somatic cell counts (Haenlein, 1974). 
Generally, subclinical or clinical mastitic infections cause the milk contents 
of casein, lactose and cheese yields to decrease, milk serum albumin, 
immunoglobulins and salt (NaCl) contents to increase.</p> 
<h3>PROCESSING</h3> 
<p>Even before cheese precipitation from milk and the effects of fermenting of 
cheese, the various methods of processing, heating and freezing can have 
profound influences on milk composition. Heating is applied during 
pasteurization, UHT processing, condensing and powder production, which will 
denature milk proteins to varying degrees and affect flavors (O'Connor, 1994). 
Freezing is of economic interest because of the seasonal nature of goat and ewe 
milk production, and because these milks have greater economic importance than 
cow's milk in some countries (Kalantzopoulos, 1994) (Table1, 2, 4). During 
frozen storage, oxidation of ewe milk occurred and free fatty acid contents 
increased because milk lipase was not completely inactivated (Anifantakis et 
al., 1980). Proteins and bacterial counts may remain stable, and taste and 
flavor scores do not change. In freezing of cheeses the pH and proteolysis may 
change (Fontecha et al., 1994). Fermentation during yogurt processing and 
cheese ripening also causes significant changes in the composition of the 
products due to proteolysis, lipolysis, glycolysis, development of flavor 
compounds and liberation of non-protein N-compounds, free amino acids, free 
fatty acids and ammonia as extensively documented by Anifantakis (1991) (Table 8
).</p> 
<h3>COMPARATIVE NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY</h3> 
<p>When milk is consumed as it becomes available from the animal or if its 
composition is changed in production and processing, a principal question in 
the pediatric and popular literature is how adequate is that milk for infant or 
general human needs (Schrander et al., 1993; Andersson &amp; Draussin, 1993; 
O'Connor, 1994). It must be understood that in general:</p> 
<p>(1) milk is the main and hard-to-replace source of dietary Ca in human 
nutrition regardless of whether it is from ewes, goats or cows;</p> 
<p>(2) milk was never meant to be an adequate source of some minerals like Fe 
or vitamins like C, B12, or folate, which are routinely and cheaply 
supplemented to daily infant diets from other sources anyway.</p> 
<p>With that understanding, milk from ewes or goats can meet at least as well 
or better significant portions of the daily nutrient requirements of humans 
(Mack, 1953; Desjeux, 1993) (Table 9). A typical serving size of milk is 1 cup 
with 245 ml content, which is used as a standard in the USA for comparison of 
nutrient intake (Gebhardt &amp; Matthews, 1991; NRC, 1968). The minimum daily 
requirements of 800 mg calcium, not considering the higher needs of pregnant 
and lactating women or adolescents, are barely met by 3 cups of cow's milk, 
while goat milk covers this amply and of ewe milk only 2 cups would be 
required. The same is true for meeting the needs of essential amino acids, 
except for methionine, phenylalanine, magnesium, thiamine and niacin, as far as 
requirements are known. Of course, equivalent amounts of yogurt or cheese can 
be substituted for meeting nutrient needs with milk.</p> 
<h3>UNIQUE NUTRITIONAL VALUES</h3> 
<p>Beyond meeting daily nutrient requirements, it is of special interest that 
goat and ewe milks have unique properties, which distinguish them from cow's 
milk and make them a valuable alternative not just for infants but also for 
adults and especially nursing mothers (Baldo, 1984; Host et al., 1988; 
Razafindrakoto et al., 1993) (Figure 1). Growing interest in goat milk has 
produced some publications, which document unique nutritional values of goat 
milk compared to cow's milk (Mack, 1953; Kosikowski, 1985; Haenlein, 1992). 
Similar research about ewe milk properties is still needed (Steinkamp, 1995). 
The high solids content of ewe milk enables production of superior yogurt 
compared to cow's and most goat milks. In order to produce acceptable yogurt 
viscosity from cow's milk, firming agents or as much as 5 percent skim milk 
powder are usually added, which however can increase greatly the lactose 
content of yogurt to undesirable levels in view of today's' consumers' concern 
with lactose intolerance (Kosikowski, 1985).</p> 
<p>The incidence of cow's milk allergy has been found to be about 8 percent or 
even more in 1-year old infants (Host et al., 1988), but goat milk can be a 
successful treatment in most cases of direct or indirect cow milk allergy 
(Walker, 1964; Brenneman, 1978; Grezesiak, 1989). Goat milk fed to 
undernourished infants or children with digestive malnutrition has been found 
to be at least equal or even a superior substitute to cow's milk (Hachelaf et 
al., 1993; Razafindrakoto et al., 1993) (Figure 1).</p> 
<p>A well-known difference for goat milk is the predominantly smaller size fat 
globule compared to cow's milk, which has been credited with easier digestion 
(Fevrier et al., 1993). Less well appreciated is the qualitative and 
quantitative difference in milk proteins of cow's versus goat milk, especially 
alpha-s-1-casein in goat milk with its softer curd formation compared to cow's 
milk (Ambrosoli et al., 1988). This may be the reason, why the popular 
literature is full of reports of benefits derived from better digestion of goat 
milk compared to cow's milk.</p> 
<p>An especially interesting difference of ewe and goat milks compared to 
cow's milk is in their basic milk fat composition (Posati &amp; Orr, 1976; 
Babayan, 1981) (Table 5). Goat and ewe milk exceed cow's milk significantly in 
most short, medium chain, mono-unsaturated, poly-unsaturated and essential 
fatty acids (Table5 and 6), which are valuable to today's health conscious 
consumer. Medium chain fatty acids (MCT) (C6 to C14), in particular have 
different human metabolic properties than long chain fatty acids. MCT, 
especially caprylic (C8:0) and capric (C10:0) have become accepted treatment 
for patients with malabsorption symptoms, a variety of metabolic disorders, 
cholesterol problems and infant malnutrition, because of their unique roles of 
providing energy to the human metabolism instead of lipids to adipose tissues, 
and because of their ability to limit and dissolve serum cholesterol (Kalser, 
1971; Tantibhedhyangkul &amp; Hashim, 1978). The contents of essential fatty 
acids also differ in ewe and goat milks compared to human milk, which could be 
of significance to nursing infants (Wright &amp; Bolton, 1989; Jackson &amp; 
Gibson, 1989) (Table5, 6, 9). It has been found that mothers of infants with 
atopic eczema had an abnormal composition in their milk fatty acid profiles, 
especially concerning linolenic acid (C18:3). Also it has been found that 
commercial milk formulae do not contain sufficient amounts of long-chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids to cover the requirements of nursing infants. It 
can be predicted that the commercial natural foods and food supplements 
industry is soon focusing its efforts on the role of different fatty acids in 
human nutrition, and the goat and ewe milk industry may be well advised to join 
this market opportunity.</p> 
<h2>CONCLUSION </h2> 
<p>The composition of ewe and goat milk in relation to human needs and in 
comparison to cow's milk needs much more research in order to document their 
unique values, to justify their existence and the higher cost of producing 
these milks compared to cow's milk (Kosikowski, 1985; Steinkamp, 1995). Besides 
the differences in milk proteins, which have commercial importance in cheese 
making and medical significance in digestion and allergies, the considerable 
differences in milk lipid composition have not been studied much in relation to 
human nutrition. Therefore, goat or ewe butter, ghee and related products, with 
their enriched concentration of MCT and other fatty acids, have considerable 
market potential (Hachelaf et al., 1993), and their unique roles in nutrition 
and medicine should be a thankful area for researchers to explore (Haenlein, 
1992). To further establish the uniqueness of ewe and goat milks will go far in 
strengthening the small yet ancient dairy sheep and dairy goat industry not 
only in the Mediterranean countries but around the world.</p>
