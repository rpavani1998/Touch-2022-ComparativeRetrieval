<b>Pasteurizing milk
</b> <br>
<br>
<b>By Patrice Lewis</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>In the last hundred years of urban migration, the home or small farm dairy 
became a lost breed. Who needed to keep a cow when it was so much simpler to 
just buy milk from the grocery store? We became more and more disconnected from 
the source of all our dairy products...as well as more concerned about the 
quality of those products as dairies became enormous, commercialized 
enterprises.</p> 
<p>The current economic climate is changing all that. Many people are deciding 
it's important to return to their agrarian roots, and part of that includes 
milking their own cow (or goat). As a result, one question which arises is 
whether or not it's necessary to pasteurize your home-grown milk.</p> 
<h3>The Age of Agriculture</h3> 
<p>Humans have been drinking milk since the dawn of agriculture. We have 
milked cows, horses, goats, yaks, buffalo, camels, and probably a bunch of 
other mammals (anything in a pinch, right?). Throughout much of the history of 
milk production, people have been subject to whatever contaminants have found 
their way into the milk.</p> 
<p>While milk is unquestionably a superior food product which supplies us with 
calcium, protein, potassium, and calories (a critical consideration in some 
parts of the world), raw milk is often subject to contamination by E. coli, 
salmonella, campylobacteriosis, and listeria. Diseases passed by milk can 
include tuberculosis, diphtheria, strep throat, scarlet fever, and typhoid 
fever. Contamination can occur either from a sick animal or, more often, from 
mishandling of the milk (including handling by sick people). There is even 
evidence that Abraham Lincoln's mother, Nancy, died of &quot;milk 
sickness&quot; after drinking contaminated milk from cows that had eaten the 
poisonous white snakeroot plant.</p> 
<p>Who knew there could be such danger in drinking milk? So what's a home 
dairyist to do?</p> 
<h3>History of pasteurization</h3> 
<p>It was Louis Pasteur who first came up with the brainchild of 
pasteurization. Pasteur was a French chemist and microbiologist who had a 
series of remarkable medical breakthroughs in disease causation and prevention 
in the mid-1800s. His research led to reduced mortality from puerperal 
(childbed) fever and he created the first vaccine for rabies. Pasteur deduced 
that microorganisms were responsible for spoiling milk (and other beverages), 
which in turn led to people becoming sick. He found that the process we now 
call pasteurization would kill the viral pathogens and render the milk safe.</p>
<p>What is pasteurization? Quite simply, it's the rapid heating and subsequent 
cooling of milk to kill off microorganisms that might be residing in milk. Poor 
refrigeration and/or handling of raw milk, as well as poor health of an animal, 
can cause microorganisms to grow and multiply, with the potential to cause 
disease. Pasteurization reduces this risk by an incredible amount.</p> 
<p>By the way, pasteurization should not be confused with homogenization, 
which is simply breaking up the fat globules into smaller sizes so they no 
longer separate in the milk. Raw milk should also be distinguished from organic 
milk, which is defined as milk from cows raised and fed in prescribed ways (no 
growth hormones or antibiotics, access to pasture, etc.). Organic milk is 
sometimes pasteurized, sometimes not (it will say so on the carton).</p> <br>

<h3>The benefits of pasteurization</h3> 
<p>It is impossible to overemphasize the importance pasteurization (and 
refrigeration) has had on public health in developed nations in the last 
hundred years. Even those who personally choose to drink raw milk cannot 
dispute the benefits pasteurization has offered to the public at large.</p> 
<p>Pasteurization has allowed dairy farmers to distribute their milk to wider 
markets. There was once a time when livestock could be kept within city limits, 
and the job of many children was to herd their family cow to the outskirts of 
the city to graze for the day. But as cities grew larger and laws regarding 
urban livestock (and their &quot;by-products&quot;) changed, cows could no 
longer be kept by urban families. This meant milk had to be trekked into the 
city from outlying areas and sold in stores. Refrigeration could keep milk 
fresh for up to a week, but until recently refrigeration as a means of keeping 
products fresh was expensive and unreliable. And even when refrigeration works, 
raw milk simply goes bad faster than its pasteurized counterpart. 
Pasteurization and refrigeration together make milk safe for those without 
access to fresh milk.</p> 
<p>So with all these benefits, why on earth would someone choose not to 
pasteurize their milk?</p> 
<h3>The drawbacks of pasteurization</h3> 
<p>Putting aside the extremist claims that pasteurized milk is the cause of 
everything from cancer to dust bunnies under the bed, there are indeed 
drawbacks to pasteurization.</p> 
<p>Taste, for one. If you've grown up on a diet of pasteurized milk, you'll 
notice a taste difference right away when drinking raw milk (and vice versa). I 
seldom hear people say store-bought milk tastes better after drinking cold 
fresh raw milk. To some extent this is a reflection on the cow's diet. Your 
average family cow is fed much differently than your average commercial cow, 
with a diet much richer in grass and less full of grain. Kids love cookies, but 
they aren't &quot;bred&quot; to live on cookies to the exclusion of healthier 
foods. Similarly, cows love grain but were bred to live on grass.</p> 
<p>The process of heating milk in order to kill pathogens will also naturally 
kill some of the beneficial bacteria, vitamins, and enzymes found in fresh 
milk. Nothing's perfect, after all, and in the quest for &quot;safe&quot; milk, 
many of the benefits of raw milk are sacrificed.</p> 
<p>There is some evidence that lactose intolerance (as well as a host of other 
conditions such as asthma, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, heart disease, etc.) 
is reduced or eliminated through drinking raw milk. However, data on these 
claims vary, and are no doubt affected by the agenda of the researchers. 
Government dairy inspectors will seldom admit that raw milk can be healthy. Nor 
will raw-food advocates admit that pasteurization can be beneficial. People 
will always find data to support their pre-existing opinions.</p> 
<h3>What's the bottom line?</h3> 
<p>In commercial dairies, the benefits of pasteurization (safety) are seen to 
outweigh the drawbacks (taste, possible health benefits). But to those people 
who are concerned about the dairy industry's additives such as antibiotics, 
growth hormones, and even bleach (to whiten the milk), the entire commercial 
dairy industry begins to seem, well, yucky.</p> 
<p>Many people are concerned to the point of paranoia about germs and dirt and 
invisible creepy-crawlies that might kill you if you eat them. It doesn't help 
that we can detect ever-smaller quantities of these microscopic terrors with 
the aid of modern technology. We can always count on the news media to whip 
these concerns into frenzy whenever a true case of E. coli or salmonella come 
to light (forgetting that these cases are news-worthy because of their rarity).
</p> 
<p>But the fact of the matter is, we have some of the safest food in the 
world. Hundreds of millions of Americans eat grocery-store food their entire 
lives without a problem. Let us not forget this in our quest for ultimate 
purity of diet.</p> 
<p>Personally I would not buy unpasteurized milk products from a store. But 
neither will I bother to pasteurize my own milk products (I make yogurt, cream 
cheese, mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, and butter). The reason is because I 
know what my cow eats, how she's treated, and how I handle her milk. I cannot 
say the same for store-bought raw milk products. Call me fussy.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, I have no doubt that most dairies which supply raw milk 
to stores have ultra-clean facilities, uber-healthy cows, and extraordinarily 
sanitary handling procedures. They must, because they are under the eagle eye 
of both government inspectors (many of whom are biased against raw milk 
consumption) as well as customers. One slip and they're history.</p> 
<p>I've also read accusations that pasteurization allows commercial dairies to 
get a bit sloppy in the cleanliness department because pasteurizing renders 
dirty milk safe. While doubtless there have been incidences of this, on the 
whole commercial dairies are vigorously inspected for sanitation standards.</p> 
<p>While some people advocate testing to ensure the safety on raw milk, there 
are problems with that. Milk contamination can occur sporadically and unevenly, 
so testing may miss contaminated milk. Also, while bacterial contamination may 
be below the detectable limit at the time of testing, bacteria are well-known 
for proliferating rapidly. By the time the milk is consumed, it could be rife 
with problems. And the trouble with contaminated milk is it may look, smell, 
and taste just fine. Unless milk smells sour or has turned to sludge, you can't 
detect the presence of E. coli or listeria by taste.</p> 
<p>But I absolutely believe customers should be able to buy raw milk from 
farmers. It ain't the government's business if someone prefers to drink raw 
milk, and it's in a dairyman's best interests to supply raw milk to his 
customers that is clean, fresh, and sanitary. Duh. Give the customer what he 
wants.</p> 
<h3>How to pasteurize</h3> 
<p>You can purchase milk pasteurizers for your home dairy. Prices range from 
$300 to $500. The advantage of a commercially-manufactured pasteurizer is 
obvious (consistent results). So is the disadvantage (price).</p> <br>
<i>You 
don&#146;t need an expensive pasteurizer for home use. A double boiler and 
thermometer will work just fine.</i> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>But it's not hard to pasteurize your own milk. There are two standard 
at-home methods, the fast (flash) or slow system. Both require the use of a 
double boiler (a two-gallon pot nested inside a three-gallon pot works fine) 
with a lid to put over the upper pot.</p> 
<p>In the flash method, heat the milk to 161&deg; F and hold that temperature 
for 15 to 20 seconds, then cool. Don't go above 161&deg; F or the milk will 
taste cooked.</p> 
<p>In the slow method, milk is heated between 140 and 150&deg; F and held for 
30 minutes.</p> 
<p>In both methods, rapid cooling is essential. Set the pot in ice water 
(replacing the ice when necessary) and stir the milk constantly until the 
temperature reaches 60&deg; F, then stir occasionally until the temp reaches 
50&deg; F. A sterile stainless steel spoon is recommended.</p> 
<h3>To pasteurize or not to pasteurize</h3> 
<p>Should you, as a home milker, pasteurize Matilda's or Bossy's daily output? 
Understand I'm talking about home milk production, not milk being sold in 
stores.</p> 
<p>As you may have gathered, there are arguments to both sides. If your 
milk-handling procedures are not the cleanest or you lack suitable 
refrigeration&#151;or you're simply squeamish at the thought of raw 
milk&#151;you may wish to pasteurize. Additionally, if anyone in your family 
has a compromised immune system, pasteurization adds an extra level of safety 
to their diet.</p> 
<p>However I don't pasteurize my milk and I doubt I ever will. That's because 
I'm satisfied with my milk-handling procedures, I have adequate refrigeration, 
and no one in my family has a compromised immune system. (And I'm not 
squeamish.)</p> 
<p>In the end it's up to you. But you knew that, didn't you?</p>
