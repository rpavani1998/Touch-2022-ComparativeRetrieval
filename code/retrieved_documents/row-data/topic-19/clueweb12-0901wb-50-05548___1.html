<h2>It&rsquo;s a powerful computer that&rsquo;s easy to use.</h2> 
<p>Every Mac comes with software that&rsquo;s easy to learn and a pleasure to 
use. And every Mac is built on OS X Lion, an operating system custom-made for 
the advanced technology inside.</p> 
<h3>Hardware and software made for each other.</h3> 
<p>Since the software on every Mac is created by the same company that makes 
the Mac, you get a fully integrated system in which everything works together 
perfectly. OS X works with your processor in your Mac to deliver the best 
possible performance. The Multi-Touch trackpad on every Mac notebook gives you 
more than enough space to pinch, swipe, and tap your way around most of the 
apps on your system. OS X gives you long battery life by dimming the screen in 
low-light conditions and even regulating processor activity between keystrokes.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Built to perform.</h3> 
<p>From the desktop you see when you start up your Mac to the applications you 
use every day, everything is designed to be simple and intuitive. If 
you&rsquo;ve used iTunes, you&rsquo;re already familiar with how simply apps 
work on a Mac. Of course, making amazing things simple requires some seriously 
advanced technologies, and OS&nbsp;X is loaded with them. Not only is it built 
on a rock-solid, time-tested UNIX foundation that provides unparalleled 
stability, it also delivers incredible performance, stunning graphics, and 
industry-leading support for Internet standards.</p> 
<p><strong>The Dock</strong>. In Mac OS X, the Dock provides fast, one-click 
access to frequently used applications, folders, files, and even items 
downloaded from the Internet.</p>

<h2>It doesn&rsquo;t get PC&nbsp;viruses.</h2> 
<p>A Mac isn&rsquo;t susceptible to the thousands of viruses plaguing 
Windows-based computers. That&rsquo;s thanks to built-in defenses in Mac OS X 
that keep you safe, without any work on your&nbsp;part.</p> 
<h3>Safeguard your data. By doing nothing.</h3> 
<p>With virtually no effort on your part, OS X defends against viruses and 
other malicious applications, or malware. For example, it thwarts hackers 
through a technique called &ldquo;sandboxing&rdquo; &mdash; restricting what 
actions programs can perform on your Mac, what files they can access, and what 
other programs they can launch. With FileVault 2, your data is safe and secure 
&mdash; even if it falls into the wrong hands. FileVault 2 encrypts the entire 
drive on your Mac, protecting your data with XTS-AESW 128 encryption. Initial 
encryption is fast and unobtrusive. It can also encrypt any removable drive, 
helping you secure Time Machine backups or other external drives with ease. 
Other automatic security features include Library Randomization, which prevents 
malicious commands from finding their targets, and Execute Disable, which 
protects the memory in your Mac from attacks.</p> 
<h3>Download with peace of mind.</h3> 
<p>Innocent-looking files downloaded over the Internet may contain dangerous 
malware in disguise. That&rsquo;s why files you download using Safari, Mail, 
and iChat are screened to determine if they contain applications. If they do, 
OS X alerts you, then warns you the first time you open one.</p> 
<h3>Stay up to date, automatically.</h3> 
<p>When a potential security threat arises, Apple responds quickly by 
providing software updates and security enhancements you can download 
automatically and install with a click. So you&rsquo;re not tasked with 
tracking down updates yourself and installing all of them one by one.</p> 
<h3>Protect what&rsquo;s important.</h3> 
<p>OS X makes it easy to stay safe online, whether you&rsquo;re checking your 
bank account, sending confidential email, or sharing files with friends and 
coworkers. Features such as Password Assistant help you lock out identity 
thieves who are after personal data, while built-in encryption technologies 
protect your private information and communications. Safari also uses 
antiphishing technology to protect you from fraudulent websites. If you visit a 
suspicious site, Safari disables the page and displays an alert warning you 
about its suspect nature.</p> 
<p>As a parent, you want your kids to have a safe and happy experience on the 
computer. OS X keeps an eye out even when you can&rsquo;t. With a simple setup 
in Parental Controls preferences, you can manage, monitor, and control the time 
your kids spend on the Mac, the sites they visit, and the people they chat with.

<h2>It backs up automatically and networks easily.</h2> 
<p>Backing up is one of those things you know you should do, but never get 
around to. Thankfully, a Mac does it for you automatically. And it connects to 
any network with ease.</p> 
<h3>Imagine never saving ever again.</h3> 
<p>With OS X Lion on your Mac, you can say goodbye to losing documents and 
hours of your time. Auto Save automatically saves your work, while you work, 
during pauses and every five minutes. And with Versions, Lion automatically 
creates a new version of a document every time you open it and every hour while 
you&rsquo;re working on it, so you can review the entire history of a document 
or revert to an earlier version of it at any time. You can even copy and paste 
between versions.</p> 
<h3>Set it, then forget it.</h3> 
<p>Every Mac comes with Time Machine: an application that automatically backs 
up your entire Mac to your external hard drive (sold separately), including 
system files, applications, accounts, preferences, music, photos, movies, and 
documents. But what makes Time Machine different from other backup applications 
is that it not only keeps a spare copy of every file, it also remembers how 
your system looked on a given day so you can revisit your Mac as it appeared in 
the past.</p> 
<h3>Network minus the work.</h3> 
<p>If you already have a wired or wireless network, a Mac can connect to it 
easily. For a wired setup, simply plug an Ethernet cable into your Mac. It 
should automatically receive the information necessary to establish a 
connection. If it doesn&rsquo;t, a helpful setup assistant will guide you 
through the process painlessly. Connecting to wireless networks is even easier. 
One click of the AirPort icon in the menu bar gives you a list of available 
Wi-Fi networks. Just select one, enter a password if required, and you&rsquo;re 
up and running. Share files with any computer on your network, browse the web, 
access work or school servers and files, and get your email. You can also 
access secure networks with the built-in VPN support.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s accessible for&nbsp;everyone.</h2> 
<p>Helpful features designed for individuals with disabilities already come on 
a Mac. To get the same functionality on a PC, you need to purchase third-party 
software.</p> 
<h3>Hear your way around a Mac.</h3> 
<p>For those who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver screen-reading 
technology that&rsquo;s part of OS X Lion enables you to use your computer via 
spoken descriptions and offers plug-and-play support for braille displays. If 
you don&rsquo;t use a screen reader but have trouble reading text on your 
computer screen, you can have your Mac &ldquo;speak&rdquo; the text you select. 
OS X Lion also lets you magnify the content on your screen, including the 
cursor, and adjust the display contrast to white-on-black or black-on-white for 
better visibility.</p> 
<h3>See your way around a Mac.</h3> 
<p>For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, OS X Lion lets you change system 
notifications from an audible alert to a visual alert. So if an application 
needs your attention, instead of playing a tone, Lion flashes the entire 
screen. Lion also supports playback of closed captioning using QuickTime 
Player, Front Row, and DVD Player applications. And if you communicate using 
sign language, iChat and the high-quality video frame rate of the built-in 
camera make for a great way to stay in touch with anyone, anywhere.</p> 
<h3>Talk your way around a Mac.</h3> 
<p>For those who find it difficult to use a mouse, keyboard, or trackpad, OS X 
Lion features Mouse Keys, Slow Keys, Sticky Keys, an onscreen keyboard, 
customizable keyboard shortcuts, trackpad gestures, and more to help you 
navigate your Mac. Speakable Items let you control the computer using your 
voice instead of the keyboard. And your Mac can even help you perform routine 
tasks by recording your actions as you do them and saving them to use later.</p>
