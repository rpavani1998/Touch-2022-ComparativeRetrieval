<h1>Mac or PC</h1> 
<h2>Which Comes Out Tops for Business and Home Use</h2> 
<p> There will never be a clear winner in the age-old debate of whether a Mac 
beats thePC, or the PC trumps the Mac, but it is infinitely clear that each 
enjoys a staunch following of devoted fans.</p> 
<p> The confusion between which is the better of the two, really comes to 
light if you are a unbiased consumer looking for the machine that best suits 
your needs, or a business owner fielding requests from individual employees, 
arguing the necessity for their preferred platform.</p> 
<h3>In this article, we will take a look at the following:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>What's the difference?</li> 
<li>Frequently asked questions about Macs and PCs</li> 
<li>Choosing the right platform for your home/schooling requirements</li> 
<li>Choosing the right platform for your office environment</li> </ul> 
<h3>What's the Difference?</h3> 
<p> Apple creates both the hardware and software applications for its 
products. This means that Apple determines specs, costs, and retailers allowed 
to carry them, and all their software runs seamlessly on their OS X operating 
system.</p> 
<p> Both use new technology like the Intel Core Duo processor, which means 
that all PC apps are now able to run on a Mac.</p> 
<p> Microsoft's Windows is the operating system associated with the majority 
of PCs in the world. This means that PC manufacturers each have their own deal 
with Windows for software, and are able to be ultra-competitive in the features 
and pricing of their hardware.</p> 
<h3>FAQ's</h3> 
<p> Both Mac and PC supporters usually take a hard-lined stance on their 
favoured platform's strengths, and the competitor's perceived weaknesses. From 
a strictly unbiased perspective, these are the need to know facts on Macs and 
PCs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong> Why are Macs more expensive than PCs?</strong> <br>
 This is a 
two-part answer because although the up front cost of a Mac may be higher, the 
long-term cost can be substantially lower than a PC.<br>
<br>
 Apple targets a 
higher market to begin with - above creating their own software and hardware, 
they use more expensive components and parts, which results in a higher up 
front cost. When you buy a Mac however, it is preloaded with the Apple line of 
software and it literally ready to use right out of the box, with no additional 
set up or software uploads required.<br>
<br>
 PCs open the door for users on a 
tight budget because competitive prices are within reach of most consumers. 
Your basic machines at the lowest end of the pricing scale are only capable of 
email, surfing the internet, and creating basic documents. The costs in 
upgrading the operating system, increasing memory, or upgrading the software 
that most PC owners use on a day-to-day basis, is where the long-term costs 
come in. Depending on what you intend to use your PC for, or how you upgrade it 
will significantly affect the total cost of your computer.</li> 
<li><strong> Are Macs best for multimedia, and PCs for business?</strong> <br>

 Macs have traditionally held the market in publishing and design, while PCs 
are the standard in business. It is most likely that Macs will continue to be 
the go-to in the publishing sector and because of their price and readily 
available support, PCs are probably going to dominate the business world for 
some time to come.<br>
<br>
 It should be noted however that both platforms are 
able to perform similar &ndash; if not the same functions, with the help of 
software specific to that use.</li> 
<li><strong> Can Macs run Windows programs?</strong> <br>
 Yes &ndash; you are 
even able to run Windows simultaneously with the Apple OS X platform. Popular 
Windows programs like Microsoft Word and Excel are also available in a Mac 
compatible format, however these obviously come at an additional cost.</li> 
<li><strong> What's with PCs and viruses, and why do they seem so unstable?
</strong> <br>
 Given that PCs make up the majority of all computers in the 
world, it makes sense that hackers are more inclined to create viruses for the 
operating system on which they can cause the most damage. Mac's operating 
system on the whole, is considered to be more stable though and generally 
requires less maintenance than a PC. That being said, PC technical support is 
cheap and easy to come by, while support for a Mac can be a little more 
challenging to find.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Choosing the right platform for your home/schooling requirements</h3> 
<p> With so many home computer options on the market, do you find yourself 
scratching your head as to what is best suited to yours and your family's needs?
<br> Historically, PC has been the go-to choice for the majority of Canadian 
households. The Mac's greatest drawbacks have revolved around compatibility, 
usability, support, and price:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Compatibility &ndash; this really is no longer an issue because Macs are 
able to run the Windows-based programs, which they were once incapable of 
doing. Peripherals like printers and scanners may also have only been PC 
friendly, and although it is best to double-check that your peripherals are 
compatible with whatever your end choice may be, the majority of computer 
accessories will work with both the Mac and PC.</li> 
<li> Usability &ndash; because PCs generally rule the workplace, some may find 
the Mac interface tough to get used to. It shouldn't take long to learn though, 
because the Mac usability is actually one of their key selling points.</li> 
<li> Support &ndash; because PCs enjoy market share majority, support tends to 
be easier to source and could be cheaper too. Apple, however, now offers 
technical support and usability classes through their brick and mortar stores 
for Mac owners.</li> 
<li> Price &ndash; as mentioned above, up front and long term costs differ for 
both platforms. When considering which is best for your household needs, take 
into account what kind of software you will need to satisfy your day-to-day 
activities, the upgrade fees associated with software and hardware for PCs, and 
your over-all budget for the machine itself.</li> 
<h3>Choosing the right platform for your office environment</h3> 
<p> Again, there is no right or wrong here, although in a business environment 
you are likely to keep a close eye on the costs of acquisition and maintenance 
of all business assets, and this alone is a determining factor for so many 
companies.</p> 
<h3>These quick tips will set the tone on how you should choose the platform 
best suited to your business needs:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Keep your bottom line top of mind at all times. If the majority of your 
employees perform day-to-day business tasks, they will have no need for an 
expensive Mac to do their jobs properly.</li> 
<li> Respect the requirement of special machines and software to fit certain 
roles. Graphics people will request &ndash; and need - a Mac for very specific 
reasons.</li> 
<li> Browser-based tools like QuickBooks Online and web-based email, often 
eliminate the Mac vs PC debate all together because they generally only require 
a basic computer to access and operate and a low end PC will do the trick.</li> 
<li> Technical support and upgrades will represent an on going cost to your 
business. Technical support may be harder to come by for a Mac-based shop but 
if you have a full-time technical expert on staff, this should not make much of 
a difference to your bottom line. Software upgrades will however be an 
expensive line item on the books so this may impact your decision to settle on 
a PC.</li> </ul> <br>
