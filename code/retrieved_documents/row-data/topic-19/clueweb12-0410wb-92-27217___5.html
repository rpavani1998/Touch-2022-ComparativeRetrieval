<h1>Windows and Mac: Differences in Everyday Operating System Use (Page 2 of 5)
</h1>  Written&nbsp;by:&nbsp;Nicholas  &bull; Edited by: Michael Dougherty <br>

Operating System <br>

<h2>Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X - Windows 7 Taskbar vs. Mac OS X Dock (Continued...)
</h2> 
<p>The Mac OS X dock can be repositioned to the bottom, left or right of the 
screen but not the top, as Mac OS X utilizes a top taskbar for various other 
functions.</p> 
<p>Now that we have covered the basic functionality differences of Windows 7 
vs. Mac OS X taskbar and dock, please note some of the following Mac 
equivalents:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>With Mac OS, the clock is located in the upper taskbar rather then the 
dock. Thus, the time is at the top of the screen.</li> 
<li>If using a laptop, the battery charge indicator and wireless network 
utility are located on the upper taskbar as well, vs. Windows 7, where the 
battery charge indicator and wireless network utility are located in the 
Windows 7 Taskbar.</li> 
<li>Earlier, we mentioned that the Mac OS dock has a magnification feature. 
The Windows 7 taskbar has a similar feature if you have a Windows 7 Aero theme 
enabled, which is an under illumination for each icon that you scroll over.</li>
</ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X - Windows 7 Start Menu vs. Mac OS X Finder</h2> 
<p>Since we already covered Windows 7 taskbar vs. Mac OS X dock, it should be 
noted that the Windows 7 Start Menu is located in the Windows taskbar, and the 
Mac OS X Finder is located in the Mac dock.</p> <br>

<p><strong></strong></p> <strong>  click to enlarge <br>
</strong> <strong>
Windows 7's</strong> Start Menu is strongly considered to be the main 
navigation point in the Windows UI. Just about anything and everything can be 
found using the Start Menu. Not only that, but you can also run commands. The 
Windows 7 Start Menu is convenient and well designed, as it has many stationary 
buttons such as Documents, Pictures, Music, Games, Computer, Control Panel, 
etc... for easy navigating to certain places. The Windows 7 Start Menu 
navigation is simple enough, and just about everything can be found by clicking 
the All Programs listing. Notably, the Windows 7 Start Menu also has an 
integrated search box, which allows you to search through files on your PC.
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Mac OS's </strong>Finder is strongly considered to be the main 
navigation point in the Mac UI. Like the Start Menu,</p>  click to enlarge <br>

Finder can be used to access just about anything on your computer. The main 
difference between the Start Menu and Finder is: The Start Menu operates using 
a list interface vs. The Finder uses a window interface. Opening up the Mac OS 
Finder basically opens up a master window, where you can quickly access the 
Macintosh Hard Drive, shared devices, and specific user files, applications and 
documents.
<p></p> <br>

<p>We have just reached a mid point in the article, where we can draw a couple 
of conclusions on Mac OS vs. Windows 7. As far as the equivalents between the 
Windows 7 taskbar and Start Menu vs. the Mac OS dock and Finder, both are 
equally capable.</p> 
<p>The biggest difference thus far is that Mac OS X constantly uses two 
elements to control programs, folders and applications, which are the dock and 
upper taskbar. Windows 7 heavily relies on one element to control most things, 
which is the Windows 7 taskbar. You will learn more about why on the next page.
