<h2>News &amp; Opinion</h2> 
<h3>Mac mini 'Too Expensive' by PC Standards</h3> 
<p>PC Authority's Darien Graham-Smith deems the 2010 Mac mini a likable, 
well-engineered machine - &quot;front-room friendly&quot; with its stylish 
aluminum casing, cool running, and near silence - but declares it not worth 
anywhere near the asking price.</p> 
<p>Graham-Smith says Apple's claim to using &quot;the latest Intel Core 2 Duo 
processors&quot; in the mini is misleading, since the Core 2 Duo is 
last-generation Intel chip technology, and says the the processor upgrade 
option to a faster 2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo is &quot;a rip-off&quot; with the 
difference in retail price for the faster silicon being around Aus$100 - but 
with Apple charging Aus$210. Ditto for Apple demanding Aus$140 for a hard drive 
upgrade from 320 GB to 500 GB, when you can buy a brand-new 500 GB drive retail 
for less than Aus$100, noting that &quot;on paper it looks like the Mac mini 
should be half the price.&quot;</p> 
<p>Editor's note: The Australian dollar is currently worth 3% less than the US 
dollar.</p>

<h3>Highlights from the 2010 Accordance Bible Software Users Conference</h3> 
<p>This Lamp's Rick Mansfield reports that the first-ever Accordance Users 
Conference, which met from September 24-25. was designed to be distinct from 
the normal training seminar. While attendees could certainly learn to use 
Accordance better as in a training seminar, the Users Conference was chance to 
see a variety of specialized presentations on numerous topics. The timing of 
the conference also coincided with the release of Accordance version 9, and the 
upcoming iOS version of Accordance which was publicly demonstrated for the 
first time.</p>

<h3>$40 Optically Designed OTC Computer Bifocals Can Prevent Eyestrain and 
Related Aches and Pains</h3> 
<p><b>PR: </b>Computer Eyed introduces high quality, affordable, over the 
counter computer glasses that prevent the irritated eyes and upper back and 
neck pain that is associated with computer or digital device use. The optically 
designed bifocal computer glasses correct for both midrange (computer) and 
close (reading/keyboard) vision. The patent-pending lens has an antiglare 
coating that reduces digital glare and provides increased visual comfort and 
acuity.</p> 
<p>&quot;These over the counter computer glasses will revolutionize the 
eyeglass industry the way the over the counter readers did for reading 
glasses,&quot; says Dave Grossman, COO of Computer Eyed, &quot;computer users 
are looking for a high quality affordable option.&quot;</p> 
<p>The increased use of computers and digital devices are taking a toll on the 
nation's eye health. The Vision Council of America estimates that more than 10 
million Americans suffer from vision problems related to computer usage. A 
study conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry 
found that there is a direct correlation between proper vision correction and 
worker productivity.</p> 
<p>Recognizing that there was a growing need to provide high quality, 
affordable, ready-made eye protection for the millions of computer users, 
Computer Eyed, a division of Vision Concepts International, developed a line of 
innovative optical quality computer glasses that correct for both computer 
vision, (midrange,18&quot; to 30&quot; from object) and reading/keyboard 
vision, (close, 8&quot; to 12&quot; from object). The patent-pending lens also 
has an antiglare coating that reduces the digital glare emitted from the 
average computer screen, thus providing the user increased visual comfort and 
acuity.</p> 
<p>&quot;Most people don't know that they are using their midrange vision when 
viewing a computer,&quot;says Optician Lester Frankel, but by wearing 
eyeglasses designed to correct for midrange vision, visual discomfort will be 
eliminated.&quot;</p> 
<p>Custom made computer glasses can cost consumers hundreds of dollars. 
Computer Eyed's over the counter bifocal computer readers are affordable, 
fashionable, and prevent the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome.</p> 
<p>Computer Eyed's computer glasses come in eight fashionable frame styles. 
The optical quality frames in a variety of styles have spring hinges, stylish 
detailing, and come with coordinating protective eyeglass case. Lens powers 
offered start at +1.50 through +3.00. Suggested retail is $39.99.</p> 
<h4>Features and Benefits of Computer Eyed Computer Glasses</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Prevents the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome</li> 
<li>Optical quality bifocal lens that corrects for both reading (close) and 
computer (midrange) vision</li> 
<li>Convenience, one pair of eyeglasses that corrects two vision problems</li> 
<li>Antiglare coating that reduces digital glare and provides increased visual 
acuity and comfort</li> 
<li>Optical quality frame and lens</li> 
<li>Spring hinges</li> 
<li>Light weight</li> 
<li>Comes with coordinating protective eyeglass case</li> </ul> 
<p>Publisher's note: I discovered years ago (after graduating to bifocals) how 
useful it is to have computer glasses when you spend a lot of time in front of 
the computer. This sounds like the next best thing to prescription computer 
glasses, and at a very reasonable price.</p>

<h3>SteelSeries Shift Interchangeable Keyset Gaming Keyboard</h3> 
<p><b>PR: </b>SteelSeries has announced their new SteelSeries Shift gaming 
keyboard. Named for the ability to alter its appearance and functionality 
through interchangeable keysets, the SteelSeries Shift brings gamers advanced 
customization capabilities that improve the way they approach, experience, and 
master their game.</p> 
<p>&quot;With the introduction of the SteelSeries Shift, we're able to bring 
another unique and powerful gaming tool to consumers, says SteelSeries CEO, 
Bruce Hawver. &quot;The Shift greatly expands the functionality and concept of 
the original Zboard, which joined our product line in 2008 as a result of our 
acquisition of Ideazon, with new SteelSeries features that will provide gamers 
with a keyboard experience that can be customized for all types of games. As we 
bring the SteelSeries Shift to market, we are continuing to work with the best 
developers and publishers in the games industry to offer player's unique 
layouts and functionalities that will enhance their entire gaming 
experience.&quot;</p> 
<h4>Premium Build Quality</h4> 
<p>The interchangeable keyset design is the only common denominator between 
the SteelSeries Shift and Zboard. The new keyboard was constructed from ground 
up with high-quality, strong materials that add durability and functionality. 
The base of the Shift and the new Shift Keysets are all made with premium 
plastic and finishes for a superior look and feel. With three height levels, 
extra wide feet, and a wrist rest that include rubber inserts to prevent 
slipping, users are able to choose what feels most comfortable for their 
preferences.</p> 
<p>Additional hardware features include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Gold plated audio-out and microphone-in 3.5mm ports</li> </ul> 
<p>2 USB 2.0 ports, including 1 powered</p> 
<ul> 
<li>LED indicators to alert when profiles and functions are active</li> 
<li>Onboard memory allows users to easily record up to 3 layers of on-the-fly 
macros at the top of the SteelSeries Shift base and have access to instant 
media controls on the left side of the keyboard. The Bar and Pad Lock keys 
allow additional layers of mapping on the F and NUM Pad keys that can be 
utilized in games or in daily applications.</li> </ul> 
<p>Every key on the SteelSeries Shift can be customized; more than just 
macros, players can record a sequence of actions with delays and then map that 
sequence to a single key. Users can then program advanced capabilities in 
multiple layers per key. Players can take advantage of an endless amount of 
layered movements with the support of its anti-ghosting capability, which 
allows up to simultaneous 7 keystrokes.</p> 
<h4>Customized Gaming Terrain</h4> 
<p>Equipped with an advanced chip reader in the SteelSeries Shift base, users 
can easily interchange SteelSeries Shift Keysets from the Standard QWERTY 
Keyset, which is included, to licensed Keysets of blockbuster game titles that 
are each sold separately. Every keyset is uniquely designed in cooperation with 
game publishers and configured with input from expert players to establish an 
intuitive command setup and predefined game mods for games of all types.</p> 
<p>The SteelSeries Shift and Shift Keysets are forward and backward compatible 
with SteelSeries Zboard and Zboard Keysets. Keysets that support backwards 
compatibility includes Aion&ocirc;, World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, 
and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Check out our product page for further 
details about compatibility.</p> 
<p>The SteelSeries Shift has an MSRP of $89.99/ &curren;89.99 and includes the 
Shift Base, and the Standard QWERTY Keyset. The SteelSeries Shift Keysets will 
be sold separately for $24.99 / &curren;24.99. You can check out the new 
SteelSeries Shift online.</p>

<h3>ClamXav, Best Free Mac Antivirus App, Better than Ever</h3> 
<p>Fairer Platform declares ClamXav 2.0.7 the &quot;best (free) AV software

Objective C, the free ClamXav Mac OS X antivirus application is &quot;pretty 
darned fast and updated with reassuring frequency,&quot; and developer Mark

but also brings updated functionality to the table.</p>

<h3>Public Beta for www.WordOf.GD Bible Linker Web App</h3> 
<p><b>PR: </b>Have you ever tried to look up a specific translation of a Bible 
verse, but it wasn't available on your favorite Bible website? Bible readers 
can now get to the passage and translation they want in an instant with the 
launch of WordOf.GD. Before, users would need to know which Bible study site 
offered any given translation in order to find the correct version of Scripture 
they wanted. But this new URL shortcut service for Bible verses lets users 
create direct links to any Bible passage in any of 30+ translations on the fly.
</p> 
<p>The web app works in a single step using any web browser address bar. Users 
simply have to type in<i>wordof.gd/</i> and the scripture verse or passage they 
are searching for. For example,http://wordof.gd/john3:16 would immediately 
bring up John 3:16 in the NIV (the default translation offered) on a major 
Bible website. If the user wanted a specific translation, they just need to 
append the translation abbreviation to the end of the URL. So
http://wordof.gd/john3:16WEB would bring up the World English Bible translation 
on a website that offers that specific translation without any prerequisite 
knowledge of which website offers which translation.</p> 
<p>The WordOf.GD Bible Linker also supports interlinear display when the URL 
includes either<i>HEBREW</i> or <i>GREEK</i> at the end of the URL. For example,
http://wordof.gd/john3.16GREEK would display the Greek interlinear text for 
John 3:16. [Editor's note: When I used the link, it didn't display anything in 
Greek. Trying an Old Testament passage, it showed Hebrew transliterated into 
Roman text, not Hebrew text. This is because WordOf.GD doesn't use the Mac's 
installed Greek and Hebrew fonts. The solution is to download the zipped 
SLGreek and SLHebrew fonts fromhttp://www.searchgodsword.org/fonts/, unzip them 
(double-clicking did not work; I had to &quot;open with&quot; Stuffit 
Expander), and double-click each font, which launches TypeBook. Click<i>Install,
</i> and you're ready to go. <i>dk</i>]</p> 
<p>To make it as easy as possible for the end-user, the WordOf.GD Web App 
recognizes most common abbreviations for books of the Bible as well. e.g. 
Verses from the Book of Matthew could be indicated with &quot;Matthew,&quot; 
&quot;Matt,&quot; or even &quot;Mt&quot;. Additionally, spaces and colons, 
typically not valid in URLs, are automatically converted to the appropriate 
characters on the fly.</p> 
<p>Users will also appreciate links available in the small header bar above 
the final Bible passage display that allow users to immediately email or tweet 
the Bible passage being viewed using WordOf.GD. And if a user wanted to use a 
link elsewhere to that specific passage being viewed, they can easily 
copy/paste a properly formatted URL shortcut also presented in the header bar.
</p> 
<p>While other Bible URL shortcut services are usually restricted to a single 
Bible website's translation offerings, WordOf.GD offers users more translations 
since it forwards users to more than one Bible website based on the translation 
requested.</p> 
<p>Pastors and ministry leaders can now create links to specific verses or 
passages on the fly in their emails, Facebook posts, or Twitter messages 
confidently without having to go to a Bible website, look up the Scripture, 
copy the URL, and use a URL shortening service liketinyurl.com or bit.ly. The 
advantage is time savings, URLs that won't break across multiple lines in some 
email readers, and easy to recognize URLs.</p> 
<p>More translations are being added quarterly. &quot;Spanish&quot; is the 
latest addition to the various translations available. The current list of all 
translations and abbreviations is available at the WordOf.Gd homepage.</p> 
<p>WordOf.GD is a web project of Godvertiser.com, which is a resource site for 
pastors and ministry leaders who want to learn about effective church marketing 
in today's environment. It is published by Kenny Jahng, founder and CEO of Big 
Click Syndicate LLC - a strategic marketing and social media 
consultancy/coaching company based in New Jersey.</p>
