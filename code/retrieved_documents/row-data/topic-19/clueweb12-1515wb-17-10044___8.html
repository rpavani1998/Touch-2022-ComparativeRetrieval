<b>Security considerations</b> <br>
 PC-Mac SecureJournal was designed 
from the ground up with security in mind. All your information is protected by 
highly secure 896-bit encryption, and the only time this information is in a 
form which can be easily accessed is when you are running&nbsp;PC-Mac 
SecureJournal. Even if a hacker manages to access the data files which store 
your information, they cannot be read without the master password or by using 
'Master Password Recovery'.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Choosing a master password<br>
 Your choice of master password is 
important in ensuring the security of your data. With PC-Mac SecureJournal, the 
master password is the only password you need to remember, so it is a good idea 
to make it reasonably long and include some numbers. For example, 
'yukonmoose597' is a good master password since it combines two unusual words 
and includes numbers as well.<br>
</p> 
<p>Enter you password into the Master Password textbox on the Master Password 
Setup dialog (see Figure 1 below). This dialog will be displayed when you press 
theKey button on the main window.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Figure 1. The Master Password Setup dialog</p> 
<p><br>
Setting up master password recovery<br>
 This powerful and unique 
feature of PC-Mac SecureJournal allows you to recover elegantly if you ever 
forget your master password.<br>
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The master password recovery system works by allowing you to enter a series 
of personal questions (ie. clues), to which only you know the answers. Any 
number of clues can be used, so you can make the recovery system at least as 
secure as the master password itself - the more clues used, the better the 
security. You should use clues which have very exact, explicit answers, which 
will never change. For example, 'What was my puppy's name when I was 6?' is a 
good clue, because it is something you will probably never forget and which 
very few people would know. An example of a poor clue is, 'Who is my best 
friend?'. The answer may change over time, thus affecting successful recovery 
(ie. you may enter what you think is the correct answer, but it may not be what 
you originally entered).<br>
<br>
 Setting up master password recovery is easy 
and is strongly recommended for all users - if you forget your master password 
and do not have master password recovery set up, you have permanently lost the 
data stored inside PC-Mac SecureJournal! On the other hand, if you have set up 
master password recovery, you just need to answer some simple questions to get 
back to the main screen. From there, you can re-familiarize yourself with your 
master password or change it to something else.<br>
</p> 
<p>To display the Master Password Setup dialog (shown above in Figure 1), 
press theKey button on the main window.<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To add a new clue, enter the question in the Question textbox and the 
answer in theAnswer textbox. Then press the Add Clue button to add it to the 
list. After you have added all the clues you want to add, press theSave button 
to save the list of clues.<br>
</p> 
<p>To update a clue, select it in the list and it will be placed in the 
textboxes. Make any changes you wish and then press theUpdate Clue button to 
update the clue in the list. Then press theSave button to save the list of 
clues.<br>
</p> 
<p>To remove a clue, select it in the list and press the Remove Clue button.
<br> <br>
</p> 
<p>Entering your master password<br>
 The great thing about PC-Mac 
SecureJournal is that you only have to enter your master password, and then all 
your important data becomes conveniently accessible. When you 
launch&nbsp;PC-Mac SecureJournal (and have set a master password), you will see 
the dialog inFigure 2 displayed. If master password recovery has been set up, 
theKey button will also be visible. If the Key button is not visible, it means 
that&nbsp;master password recovery has not been set up and is not available.</p>
<p><br>
</p> Figure 2. The Enter Master Password dialog <br>

<p>Enter your master password and press the Enter button to display the main 
PC-Mac SecureJournal window. If you get the master password wrong, you can try 
again. If you have forgotten your master password, press theKey button to begin 
master password recovery. The dialog shown inFigure 3 will then be displayed.
<br> </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Figure 3. The Master Password Recovery dialog<br>
</p> 
<p>Simply enter the answer to each question in the Answer textbox and press the
Next &gt;&gt; button. After you have worked through the series of questions and 
answers, the main window will be displayed. If you can't remember the answer to 
a particular question, think about it for a while before trying again. If you 
cannot remember either the master password or the answers to the questions for 
master password recovery (ie. you can't recover), you cannot access the data 
stored inside PC-Mac SecureJournal.<br>
</p> 
<p>If you can't recover, you should quit PC-Mac SecureJournal and move the 
PC-Mac SecureJournal preferences folder (see theFAQ) to a safe place on your 
hard disk (such as a backup folder) and then run PC-Mac SecureJournal again. 
Your master password will now be cleared and all your previous data will be 
safely stored away in case you remember enough information to recover.<br>
<br>

</p> 
<p>The layout of the main window<br>
 As soon as you launch PC-Mac 
SecureJournal and enter your master password (if you have set one), the main 
window will be displayed (seeFigure 4 below). On the left is the monthly 
calendar used to manage journal entries, and on the right are the controls for 
managing documents. TheKey button under the document controls allows you to set 
the master password and enter the master password recovery questions and 
answers.<br>
</p> 
<p>The main text editing area is located at the bottom of the window, along 
with the usual types of text attribute controls found in any word processor, 
such as font style (theBold, Italic, Underline and Normal buttons), font size 
(theFont Larger and Font Smaller buttons) and font color (the Red, Green, Blue 
andBlack buttons). To select a different font type, use the Font menu on the 
menu bar.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Figure 4. The main window<br>
</p> 
<p>The four buttons on the left, under the status message (from left to right) 
are theMinimize button, the Display Lock-Out button, the Line Separator button 
and theTime/Date stamp button.</p> 
<p>The Minimize button allows you to use the most of your screen space by 
hiding the calender and document controls. Pressing the button once hides the 
controls, pressing it again reveals the controls.</p> 
<p>The Display Lock-Out button (also activated by pressing the Esc key on your 
keyboard) instantly makes the main window invisible and displays the master 
password dialog. This function helps prevent someone from walking by your 
computer and reading your notes whilst you are editing them. You can also 
activate this function to protect your information when you are temporarily 
away from the computer. To display the main window again, enter the master 
password.<br>
</p> 
<p>The Line Separator button inserts a line of dashes into your document, and 
can be used to separate sections of text.<br>
</p> 
<p>The Time/Date stamp button inserts the current time and date into your 
document. This is useful if you want to timestamp your journal entries during 
the day or if you want to place a time/date stamp into your documents.<br>
<br>

</p> 
<p>How to use the daily journal<br>
 The monthly calendar is used to manage 
your journal entries (seeFigure 5 below).&nbsp;To change the month displayed, 
press theNext Month or Previous Month buttons. The month is formatted in such a 
way that it shows the day-of-the-week of each day.&nbsp;The current 
day-of-the-month is also drawn in red (ie. today's date), whilst all other 
dates are drawn in black.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> Figure 5. The monthly calendar<br>
</p> 
<p>When PC-Mac SecureJournal is launched, the current day's journal entry will 
be opened immediately and made ready for you to edit.</p> 
<p>To select a different day, click on it in the calendar. A black rectangle 
will be drawn around it to show it is selected. The main text editing area will 
also become active (if it was inactive), ready for you to input your journal 
entry. If you've selected a day without a journal entry (ie. one which is not 
highlighted in green on the calendar), a journal entry for the day will be 
created automatically when&nbsp;you start typing. Since days which have a 
journal entry are highlighted in green, it's easy to see which days have 
journal entries and which days you have missed in the month.<br>
</p> 
<p>The journal is designed to be sleek, fast and efficient, even with years of 
daily journal entries. Thus, you can rely on PC-Mac SecureJournal to help you 
maintain a secure and thorough diary of your&nbsp;personal experiences, 
thoughts and ideas well into the future. </p> 
<p>You also need never worry about saving your data to disk, as you would with 
a word processor - this is all done automatically by&nbsp;PC-Mac SecureJournal. 
Whenever you select a new date in the calendar, create or open a document, or 
quit PC-Mac SecureJournal, any journal entry you have open will be saved. 
Whilst you are editing a journal entry, your updated text will also be 
auto-saved every five minutes.<br>
<br>
Special note: To remove the journal 
entry for a particular date, click on it in the calendar (to load it from 
disk), delete it's text in the main text editing area and then select a 
different day. You will find the journal entry will be deleted (as indicated by 
the removal of the green highlighting for that date).<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Managing your documents<br>
 The Document popup menu (see Figure 6 below) 
is used to select from the documents you have available for editing. Selecting 
a document in the popup menu will load it from disk and display it in the main 
text area, ready for editing. To create a new document, enter it's name in the 
textbox and press theNew Document button - the new document will be created, 
it's name added it to theDocument popup menu, and the main text area made ready 
for you to edit. To delete a document, select it from the&nbsp;Document popup 
menu and then press theDelete Document button (as a precaution, you will be 
asked to confirm the deletion).</p> 
<p><br>

</p> 
<p>You also need never worry about saving your data to disk, as you would with 
a word processor - this is all done automatically by&nbsp;PC-Mac SecureJournal. 
Whenever you select a date in the calendar, create a new document, select a 
different document, or quit PC-Mac SecureJournal, any document you have open 
will be saved. Whilst you are editing a document, your updated text will also 
be auto-saved every five minutes.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Backup your data!!!<br>
 It would be very sad if you spent considerable 
time and effort writing a diary/journal or editing private notes and then lost 
them due to a hard disk crash or similar catastrophe. It is strongly 
recommended that you backup your data regularly (at least once per week) by 
copying it onto backup media such as a zip disk, a networked hard disk, or 
other storage. Avoid floppy disks, unless you are desperate - they have very 
limited capacity and are unreliable.<br>
</p> 
<p>To do a backup of your PC-Mac SecureJournal data, include the 'PC-Mac 
SecureJournal' preferences folder in your regular backup.&nbsp;This folder is 
in the 'Preferences' folder inside the 'Library' folder in your user folder on 
MacOS X, in the 'Preferences' folder inside the 'System' folder on MacOS 
Classic, in the 'WinNT' folder in Windows 2000, and in the 'Windows' folder in 
Windows 9.x.</p>
