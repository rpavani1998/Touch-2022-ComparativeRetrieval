<blockquote> 
<p>These days, many people try to claim that Windows 95, 98 and/or Windows ME 
are &quot;just as easy&quot; as the Mac, but as soon as you scratch below the 
surface of each operating system, you&#146;ll quickly discover that the Mac OS 
is still the better designed choice.</p> 
<p>Nowhere is this more apparent than when it comes to troubleshooting common 
problems. Windows continues to show its ugly DOS-based history or some other 
arcane architectural flaw as soon as you start trying to fix something that 
goes wrong on your PC (see the articles&quot;PC Software Troubleshooting 
Tips&quot; and &quot;PC Hardware Troubleshooting Tips&quot; for more). The 
Macintosh, on the other hand, is generally much less prone to problems and 
those problems that do arise tend to have more straightforward answers.</p> 
<p>But that doesn&#146;t mean problems don&#146;t happen on the Mac because 
they still do. In fact, for some people, they are maddeningly common. Sometimes 
the issues are hardware-related (see the accompanying&quot;Mac Hardware 
Troubleshooting Tips&quot; for more), but most of the time they have to do with 
software problems.</p> <b></b>
<p><b>Staying Up to Date</b></p> 
<p>One area where the Mac really isn&#146;t that different from PCs is in the 
need to keep your software up-to-date. New application updates, operating 
system patches, and other types of upgrades are often the key to solving 
frustrating problems or just some annoying glitches. So, before you get too far 
into the troubleshooting process, take an inventory of your software and 
hardware and check to see if any updates are available online from the web 
sites of the companies whose products you use.</p> 
<p>One site you&#146;ll certainly want to check is Apple&#146;s Software 
Updates page. In addition, don&#146;t forget to check on any extensions you 
have installed, particularly ones that function as drivers for any hardware 
you&#146;ve added to your Mac.</p> <b></b>
<p><b>Extending the Mac&#146;s Reach</b></p> 
<p>Speaking of extensions, the vast majority of problems that pop up on 
Macintoshes are due to what are called extension conflicts. Before I get into 
what that means, let me tell you a little bit about how the Mac OS works.</p> 
<p>When Apple designed the Mac&#146;s operating system they knew they 
wouldn&#146;t be able to provide all the features that people wanted, so they 
also built in a mechanism that lets Mac users add to or extend the capabilities 
of the OS very easily. This mechanism consisted of files called extensions that 
could, well, extend or alter the features of the operating system. By placing 
these files into a special Extensions folder inside the System Folder, they are 
automatically loaded and run whenever the Mac starts up.</p> 
<p>The only time most Mac users even become aware of extensions is during the 
startup, when the little icons representing different extension files dance 
across the bottom of your Mac&#146;s screen. (Not all extensions have startup 
icons, by the way, so don&#146;t presume that because you counted 8 or 10 
different icons during the startup, or boot, process that&#146;s all you have. 
Most Macs have at least 40 or 50 extensions and many have 100 or more.)</p> 
<p>The way that many&#151;though not all&#151;Mac extensions work is that they 
are loaded into memory along with Mac OS at startup time and stay there until 
you shut down. So, for example, if you have an extension file like Adobe&#146;s 
Type Manager, it adds its type-rendering features to the operating system as 
your Mac starts up, and stays there as an &quot;extension&quot; to the 
operating system for as long as your Mac is on.</p> 
<p>The benefit of this arrangement is that any and all programs that run on 
your Mac and need access to the features offered by the extension can get to 
them by interacting with the operating system, as they normally do. The 
downside, however, is that some programs don&#146;t operate correctly when used 
in conjunction with certain extensions or certain versions of specific 
extensions. In addition, some extensions step on each other&#146;s toes by 
providing some of the same types of changes to the Mac OS. Others simply make 
changes in a way that conflicts with each other.</p> 
<p>Finally, the last drawback of this arrangement is that if you&#146;re using 
applications that can&#146;t or don&#146;t take advantage of the features 
offered by certain extensions, you&#146;re wasting precious Mac memory. The 
reason is, once an extension has been loaded into memory it stays there and 
continues taking up space until you shut down your Mac. As we move towards 
larger and larger amounts of RAM this concern is becoming increasingly less 
important, but it&#146;s still there.</p> 
<p>By the way, if you ever want to see just how much memory your extensions 
use, try this simple procedure. First, do a normal Mac startup and when you 
reach the desktop, go up to the Apple menu and select About This Computer (or 
About This Macintosh or whatever the message on your machine happens to be) to 
see a display of how much memory each application on your Mac is currently 
using. Make note of how much the Mac OS, or System, is using. Now, restart your 
Mac holding down the Shift key until you see a message about No Extensions 
(I&#146;ll explain what this means in a bit) and when you get to the desktop, 
go to the Apple menu again and select the same menu item. You should see a 
dramatically lower amount of memory being used by the Mac OS, or System, in 
this case. The difference between the two is the amount of memory that your 
extensions are using.</p> <b></b>
<p><b>Extensions Manager to the Rescue</b></p> 
<p>So, what&#146;s the trick to solving Mac extension conflicts? Using the 
Extensions Manager that&#146;s been built into the Mac OS since System 7.5, or 
an alternative commercial utility such as Casady &amp; Greene&#146;s popular
Conflict Catcher. Either program lets you selectively turn off individual 
extensions or groups of extensions at startup time so that you can try and 
figure out what&#146;s causing the problem. They also let you change the order 
in which the extensions are loaded, which can also make a difference. Some 
extensions need to be loaded last or near the end in order not to conflict with 
others.</p> 
<p>To get to Extensions Manager (which is actually a Control Panel), you can 
hold down the space bar while you&#146;re starting your Mac, or choose 
Extensions Manager off the Control Panel submenu under the Apple menu while 
your Mac is already running. Conflict Catcher lets you assign a hot key to 
launch it during startup but it also defaults to the space key. Essentially 
what you do with either utility is select a group of extensions that you want 
to keep &quot;on&quot; and a group that you want to turn &quot;off&quot; and 
then after your computer starts with the set of extensions you&#146;ve chosen, 
you try to recreate the problem you were having.</p> 
<p>In some situations, extension conflicts can keep your Mac from booting at 
all. If you only make it part of the way through the startup process and then 
your computer freezes up, then that&#146;s the classic sign of an extension 
conflict. (A partial boot can also be a symptom of a hardware-based SCSI 
problem, though, so check the&quot;Mac Hardware Troubleshooting Tips&quot; 
article for more.) If it does turn out to be an extension-related problem, 
you&#146;ll know you&#146;ve found the problem when the Mac makes it through 
the startup phase and brings you to the desktop.</p> 
<p>Some extension conflicts don&#146;t occur during startup, however. If 
you&#146;re having trouble running certain applications or groups of programs, 
you&#146;ll want to check those after you&#146;ve selected a different set of 
startup extensions. If the same problem occurs (or if your Mac still can&#146;t 
boot), then you haven&#146;t found the culprit and you&#146;ll need to select a 
new set and go through the process all over again.</p> 
<p>As you might expect, finding extension conflicts can be very slow and 
tedious (aren&#146;t computers grand!), but Conflict Catcher makes it a bit 
easier by automating the testing and restarting process to a certain degree.</p>
<p>By the way, in addition to turning off certain extensions to avoid 
conflicts, you can get more memory for your applications by turning off 
extensions that you aren't regularly using. As the above example shows, 
extensions can take up a lot of memory and turning off a bunch of them (or even 
sometimes just a few of them) may give you several megabytes of RAM space back.
</p> 
<p><strong>Giving Yourself Enough Room to Work</strong></p> 
<p>Speaking of RAM, another problem that can occur with Macs is running out of 
memory. Like PCs, Macs take advantage of something known as virtual memory, 
which basically uses some space on your Mac's hard drive to &quot;fake&quot; 
the system into thinking it has more real physical RAM than it actually does. 
So, for example, a system with 32 MB that uses virtual memory might appear to 
the MacOS as having 64 MB of working room. You can turn virtual memory on and 
off via the Memory control panel. In most instances you'll want it on, but 
there are some older applications that won't work properly with it turned on, 
so you should check your Mac's settings and adjust them as necessary.</p> 
<p>A practical benefit of virtual memory is that it gives your Mac enough room 
to open up multiple applications. However, it doesn't necessarily impact how 
much memory each application has to use, nor does it automatically increase the 
amount of memory allocated to each application as needed. Instead, the amount 
of memory allocated to each application is determined by an obscure setting in 
the application program's Get Info box. To find this, click on the application 
you want to check in a Finder window and select Command (the clover key)-I or 
select Get Info from the Edit menu. (You have to do this on the original 
application file, not an alias.)</p> 
<p>Inside the ensuing dialog box you'll see a reference to the minimum amount 
of memory required by the application to run, as well as a preferred amount. If 
you increase both those numbers (they're often in Kilobytes, so divide by 1,024 
to figure out the amount in Megabytes), you'll increase the amount of memory 
the application has to do its own work. This can be very handy if you're 
working with large or complex documents because if the application doesn't have 
enough room to do its work, you may get an error message saying there isn't 
enough memory even if you have lots of RAM installed and it's the only program 
running.</p> 
<p>You don't want to increase the amount too much, however, because these 
numbers affect how much memory the MacOS sets aside for the application. If the 
application has way more than it needs, you'll just be wasting memory. So, the 
trick is to find an amount that lets you work without getting out-of-memory 
messages, but doesn't take more than necessary. By the way, if you have only 
one or two problematic documents, you can always just adjust the application's 
memory allocations--which is what these numbers are called--right before you 
work with them, and then change them as soon as you're done. You can't change 
them while the application is open, but otherwise it can be done at any time.
</p> <b></b>
<p><b>Problems with Preferences</b></p> 
<p>Another fairly common problem on Macintoshes has to do with preference 
files, which are files used by most applications to store certain settings they 
need to operate properly. If you&#146;re having problems with a specific 
application, it may be due to a bad or corrupted preferences file.</p> 
<p>There&#146;s no easy way to tell by simply looking at a preferences file 
whether it has a problem, but there is a simple procedure you can try if you 
suspect a problem. Just open the Preferences folder inside your Mac&#146;s 
System Folder, look for the preferences or &quot;prefs&quot; file for the 
particular application, and drag it into the Trash. Most applications will 
automatically create a new preferences files the next time you start them if 
they can&#146;t find an existing one in the Preferences folder.</p> 
<p>In some cases you may have to reset any adjustments you had previously made 
to the program&#146;s preferences or settings dialog box, but that&#146;s a 
small price to pay to get your application working again.</p> <b></b>
<p><b>Viruses and Other Issues</b></p> 
<p>Mac users were very fortunate for many years because the Mac OS was fairly 
free of computer viruses. Recently, however, that situation has changed and now 
Mac users also need to be on the lookout for viruses (such as AutoStart Worms), 
Trojan Horse programs (which hide bad things in a seemingly innocent 
package&#151;hence their name), and other nasty stuff that can wreak all kinds 
of havoc on your Mac.</p> 
<p>If you&#146;re encountering strange problems, such as a Desktop Print 
Spooler that keeps launching and won&#146;t go away, you may have contracted a 
virus. To fix that problem and/or avoid getting any viruses in the future, make 
sure you purchase and install an anti-virus program such asNorton AntiVirus or 
Virex and, most importantly, keep the virus definitions up to date. New 
computer viruses are being developed and unleashed at an alarming rate and even 
if you have the most recent version of an anti-virus program, you may still be 
at risk if the virus definitions&#151;which is what looks for and erases 
specific viruses&#151;aren&#146;t current.</p> 
<p>If you come across generic Mac error messages that have specific numbers in 
them, you might be able to find more information about them inthis article from 
Apple&#146;s Technical Information Library. The article is a bit out of date, 
but you still may find it helpful if you want to find out about certain types 
of specific error codes. If you&#146;re still coming across Type 11 errors on 
your Power Mac, you might want to readthis article (although updating to a 
current version of the MacOS would probably help as well).</p> 
<p>Finally, if all else fails, there are several excellent Mac-specific 
troubleshooting resources available here on the Web. Apple&#146;sTech Exchange 
and previously mentionedTechnical Information Library, for example, are the 
company&#146;s answer to Microsoft&#146;s extensiveKnowledge Base, and includes 
all kinds of articles describing specific problems and offers solutions to 
those problems. TheBasic Troubleshooting Article from the Tech Exchange, in 
particular, offers some great general troubleshooting advice. You may also want 
to checkMacFixIt, Macintosh Software &amp; Extension Conflict Troubleshooting, 
or other Mac sites you see listed on myTroubleshooting Resources page.</p> <b>
</b>
<p><b>The End</b></p> 
<p>There&#146;s no question that the Macintosh and the Mac OS are great 
products, even if they aren&#146;t quite perfect&#151;yet. If you do run across 
problems, bear in mind some of the previous tips, use some of the available 
resources and you should be able to keep your Mac in top working form.</p>
