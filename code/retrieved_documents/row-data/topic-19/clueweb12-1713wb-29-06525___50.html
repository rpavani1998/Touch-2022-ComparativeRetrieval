<p>I was informed by my special someone the other day, that he&rsquo;d like to 
get me a laptop for Christmas. What a sweety!?</p> 
<p>I bought my desk top that I still currently use in 2005&hellip; and 
honestly it works fine, considering all the crap it&rsquo;s been through, so 
I&rsquo;ll probably keep it along with my laptop. But I&rsquo;m 
wondering&hellip; should I get a PC.. or take the MAC road?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to some friends on Twitter about this, but I thought 
I&rsquo;d ask my blog friends what they thought, and why.</p> 
<p>So, the question of the day is&hellip;. pc or mac? and why? </p>  All

<p>I have both and I have to say that I LOVE my MacBook!! My PC is forever 
getting viruses that result in rebulding the harddrive, but my Mac has never 
had a problem! There are wonderful applications for the Mac too.</p> </li>

<p>Mac &ndash; I switched a year ago and it was the best idea. So much easier 
to use and it has NONE of the issues I had with my PC (viruses, slow, heavy). 
The only issue is that there are programs that don't work on a Mac, but there 
are a LOT of ways to work around that so they work.</p> </li>

<p>I have a PC at work and Mac at home. Definitely go for Mac! As the previous 
posters pointed out: prettier (of course that doesn't really matter), fewer 
viruses, very user-friendly, and Apple constantly comes up with fun techy stuff 
for their Macs</p> </li>

<p>To have a choice on that matter? Amazing! Lucky girl! I'd Mac. While I do 
have a PC, it runs Linux (configured it myself and LOVE it!). I can hardly 
stand working on Windows anymore. At school we have Mac iBooks and they are 
amazing to work with. As said not all programs work on Mac but there's great 
alternatives. There is also a decreased risk of viruses (the same way if you 
use Linux). Apple also has great support from what I've heard. And final 
reason, Macs have a tendency to do better with the entertainment end of things 
(graphics, web-development, video editing, etc.) Good luck!</p> </li>

<p>Looks like I'm the lone PC voice&hellip;I just bought a Lenovo laptop a few 
months ago, and I absolutely LOVE it.</p> 
<p>It's cheap (less than $600&ndash;you won't find a Mac for that!), fast, and 
does everything I need it to do. If you play around with a lot of multimedia 
stuff (video and audio editing, mostly), then sure, get a Mac. Otherwise, you 
can get everything you need from a decent PC for a hell of a lot less cash.</p>

<p>I would say a PC&hellip; Macs are more expensive, and they are so 
proprietary that pretty much have to take it to apple to get it fixed. But if 
you go PC- not a Dell. The laptop before this one was a Dell and I had a 
million problems with it- but if you go Dell, GET A WARRANTY! I had to replace 
the screen once, the motherboard twice, the powercord about 5 times, the heat 
fan twice and the cd drive three times. That was in 4 years, but still. I have 
a Dell again, but only because I got a massive discount through my work (800 
bucks off total&hellip;) but even then, I have still had to call them about 4 
times in 14 months I have had this. So, my suggestion- a PC but not a Dell, or 
a Dell with a long warranty because then it covers basically everything, you 
just have to take the time to get it done.</p> </li>

<p>We got an iMac almost 2 years ago and it is amazing. There are some really 
cool applications and it hasn't gotten a virus.</p> 
<p>But make sure you get the warranty or whatever. That allows you to call in 
apple anytime without being charged. And it's really good to have because if 
you don't know how to do something or whatnot you can call them and they'll fix 
it for you in a couple of minutes.</p> 
<p>If use microsoft a lot, you will have to get Microsoft for Mac. I really 
really need that for school assignments and powerpoints, etc and Mac's Page app 
is not compatible with PC.</p>

<p>If you can get someone to program it, I would suggest getting a PC and them 
programing it to run Mac as well. Like reverse &quot;Parallels.&quot; It's 
super-convenient and works a lot better and faster than parallels.</p> 
<p>Or, if you can't find someone to do that, I'd get a mac and run 
&quot;parallels&quot; even though that's just not as good.</p> 
<p>I'm one of those people who's not a Mac or a PC. I'm a Pac. Or an MC. </p>

<p>While I like PCs, I definitely prefer MACs. I have a MacBook and I 
absolutely love it. Of course, the downside of MACs are the prices (they are 
definitely on the pricier side), but it's worth it. They're wonderful.</p> </li>

<p>I work on macs all day long and have both a macs and a pc at home.</p> 
<p>The points have pretty much already been made but here's my two cents:</p> 
<p>Get a mac IF 1) You go online 2) You have the extra cash</p> 
<p>Get a pc IF 1) You just use it to typeset 2) Your tight on cash</p> 
<p>Macs last a lot longer than pcs, in general.</p> 
<p>Good luck and have fun with your new toy!</p> </li>

<p>So far in the last 10 years&hellip;I've used about 6 different 
laptops&hellip;ranging from Compaq all the way to Acer&hellip;. I now have a 
Macbook and I think it is the best computer hands down that I've ever used. 
It's very user friendly&hellip;handles all updates on its own&hellip;I never 
have to worry about viruses and crashes&hellip;It's so comfortable to type on 
because the keyboard is slightly different from other laptops&hellip;the keys 
are more sunk in so there's less stress on your fingers.<br>
I would highly 
recommend a Macbook.</p>

<p>I have to voice the same opinions already stated. I've had to return my 
Gateway more often than I've had the thing working in the house, but it was 
inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. I bought Acers for 2 of my kids, I've 
had to return them once as well. I got an Asus gaming computer for my oldest, 
and it's great, but it cost as much as a Macbook. We have several iMacs, they 
work great, and the hubs has a Macbook, it's at least six years old, and when 
we had a minor problem, Apple fixed it and returned it right away. (I had to 
wait weeks for the PC's to be returned.) So, I would recommend getting an 
extended warranty on almost any laptop &ndash; much more fragile than a desktop 
&ndash; and if funds are limited, get a PC, and if money is not a concern, 
Macbook. Apple makes a great computer that's super user friendly, but it does 
take time to get used to.</p> 
<p>Have fun with whatever you get!</p>

<p>I've had a PC for years. I finally got my first MAC about 4 months ago. I 
love it! It was worth the price and I'm extremely happy with it. I found it 
much easier to work with and navigate. Over all I'm happy with how my programs 
run (compared to PC). I also got tired with all the virus the PCs were getting 
and I had virusprotection!<br>
I've only had desktops but I know lots of people 
who have the Macbooks and love them. If and when I get a laptop it will 
definitely be a MAC.</p> </li>

<p>In the commercial I like the Mac. As someone that's getting a Windows 
Vistaectomy today unless the guy turns into an icicle since it happens to be -8 
I'd go with Mac since I'm guessing I have a PC. I've had a lot of problems 
although I do like Herbie and hope he ends up getting fixed. This probably 
isn't helpful at all but hey it might amuse or not.</p> </li>

<p>I just bought a MacBook two weeks ago and am very much loving it. There are 
some inconveniences (default programs/applications PC has that you'll have to 
download for Mac), but it's very nice, and once you get used to it, you 
probably won't want to go back. </p> </li>

<p>I was a PC girl until three years ago when I bought a MAC. It was instant 
love. I will never go back to PC. Mac's don't crash, hang, lose stuff, 
generally they are just perfect *sigh* They are also user friendly, gorgeous to 
look at and to use. I can't recommend MAC's enough. If I was you, I wouldn't 
hesitate, buy a MAC!!! </p> </li>

<p>It's a really hard choice &ndash; I LOVE my PC, even though it is 
constantly getting annoying viruses. My bf has a mac, and I hate it. There are 
so many things that seem logical and easy on a pc that are mega complicated on 
the mac. My bf agrees, but he still prefers his mac. And I still prefer my pc. 
There are so many great things about a mac, it's true, but pcs are just simpler.
<br>So go with PC!!!!</p> </li>

<p>I have used a MacBook Pro since 2007 and I love it! The graphics are really 
great and the operating system is soo much easier to use than Windows. However, 
it's not a mac world out there so the compatibility is very trying. If you do 
decide to get a Mac, you might want to consider the dual boot system (Boot 
Camp) so you will be able to switch back and forth between Mac and Windows. 
This way you will be able to see/edit say Word docs people have sent you. BUT 
if you're going to keep your PC and it has all the Window stuff on it, then you 
could get by without having Windows on your Mac. Another &quot;downside' is 
that everything (iLife, iWork, etc) is all separate and unless you have a 
hotmail, yahoo, MSN, etc email, you will have to pay for Mac's email system.<br>
Blogging with a Mac is a bit different as well. Things you do on a Mac will not 
always look the same on a Windows operating system&ndash;but if you have both a 
Mac and a PC, you're probably going be covered!<br>
I don't regret getting a 
Mac no matter how incompatible it is with programs like Microsoft 
Office&ndash;unless you're a student like me or run a 
business&ndash;compatibility might not be a problem for you. I'd do some 
research, find out what programs you need and stuff because like I said, unless 
you buy a package deal, everything is separate. If you do get a Mac you will 
instantly despise Windows!</p> </li>

<p>I've been a Mac for almost three years now and I will never go back to PC. 
It took some getting used to at first, but once I was initiated, that was it. 
The only complaint is that Safari isn't compatible with all online sites, so I 
downloaded firefox, but that tends to freeze up more than I think it should. I 
need to find a better browser.</p> 
<p>Make sure if you go Mac that you know how many Mac-authorized service 
places there are near you. We have only one in this area and it's half and hour 
away. Kind of a pain, but I haven't had to go into the genius bar more than two 
or three times over the years, all under warranty (be sure to get the extended 
warranty!)</p> </li>

<p>I have always been a mac person they are so much better and easier to use.

 are you kidding? after all my offers of talking to my hubby 
who is a manager at apple you still have to ask?<br>
Mac! and not just because 
he works there. they are better. they are easier. they have like a handful of 
viruses where pc's have hundreds of thousands. we've been mac people for about 
9 years and have never had a virus. plus, if you have any questions you can 
always ask me. and if i don't know i'll ask him.<br>

<p>I'm a MAC person and always have been one (except for office jobs). That's 
been over 2 decades . My computers have never had a virus. Macs are so user 
friendly and well designed. Plus they're cool.</p> 
<p>I just upgraded this fall to a MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard, and I love 
it. I chose the non-glare screen because it's easier on the eye while writing 
for long hours. In addition to being a writer, I'm a professional photographer 
and artist so a big part of the appeal was having a dedicated graphic card (mid 
range one) and excellent graphics.</p> 
<p>What a nice holiday gift! Sounds like he's a keeper (as they say in Maine.)

<p>The battery life on a Mac is great, so if you want to do a lot of work 
without being connected to your charger, get a Mac.</p> 
<p>If you're going to be doing something other than writing or going online, 
see if the programs you will be using are available for Macs.</p> 
<p>As others have mentioned, if anything happens to it, you will have to send 
it to apple care, but if you have a back up computer, it shouldn't be too much 
of an inconvenience.</p> 
<p>I'm a PC user, but most all my friends have Macs and they run well.</p>

<p>For me, a PC all the way. Why? Well, I used both a PC (home) and a Mac 
(school) while growing up and always found the PC easier to use. And now Macs 
are just plain confusing to me.</p> 
<p>Plus this: I've crashed three Macs. Which are supposed to be impossible to 
crash. Oh yes, and they were dead, dead too. As in having to be sent back to 
the factory dead. So how's that for a computer that &quot;doesn't crash&quot;? 
And one of the school computers also got a virus on it while I was using it 
(computers hate me), which is also supposed to be impossible for Macs. So now I 
just stay away. Far, far away.</p> </li>

<p>I must vote for a Mac. They are more expensive, but they hold their value. 
I bought my first MacBook this summer, and was totally convinced I was going to 
get a great deal on eBay. It did not take long before I realized that used Macs 
were going for prices very comparable to new ones. So I bought a new one and 
got a free iTouch and $100 printer credit. I'm so, so, so happy. And I know 
that if/when I want to upgrade, my computer will hold its value. I can sell it 
and take that money and apply it to my new purchase. My husband can only use 
his old PCs for parts. </p> 
<p>No matter what you decide, enjoy picking out your new computer. What a 
generous and thoughtful gift!</p> </li>

They are more versatile and you aren't 
constrained by brand. A Mac is a Mac, but a PC can be any brand &ndash; which 
means if you need to upgrade, change something, etc. you won't be forced to 
shop from the Mac store and pay their prices.<br>
And software often comes out

<p>It depends on what you plan to do with it. If you are surfing the internet, 
writing, and playing games&hellip;stay with a PC. It's cheaper and you can 
customize the speed.</p> 
<p>If you are doing video editing, home videos and that kind of stuff, go with 
a Mac. So far, I've been working on a 46 second video for 4 hours and still 
can't get it working. I'm making friends with people in Vista forums. You

<p>To be honest, in reality PCs are more expensive than Macs in the long run, 
seeing as how you basically need to replace the PC every 6 months, and there is 
a greater risk of viruses and crashing. Whereas, yes a mac in the short-run is 
more expensive, but over time, you actually save money with the mac, since you 
aren't constantly fixing or replacing it.</p> </li>

<p>When I had a PC I had a lot more problems with viruses, spyware, etc. I've 
only had my Mac for a few months, but it's true love. If it's a big deal to 
you, Macs are pretty envionrmentally friendly. They have a really long battery 
life so you don't have to keep them plugged in all the time and they are made 
of recycled materials, I believe. Also, my Mac is way more lightweight than my 
old Dell was, so it's a lot easier to travel with. I hope this helps!</p> </li>

<p>Having been there and done that I can tell you that if you have never used 
a Mac and switch is going to be a bit of a, say, culture shock. It wears off, 
sure, but from then on you do have to look out for compatibility issues.</p> 
<p>But, on the plus side, Mac's crash a lot less and no viruses.</p> 
<p>PCs, though, are more user-friendly, I think.</p>

<p>My opinion? PC. </p> 
<p>I have had my laptop for 5 years now. I don't recommend Dell or HP or any 
of those. Partially because the little experience I've had is not good.</p> 
<p>I got my computer from a place called PC Laptops. They aren't a huge chain 
so that might be a problem for you. Maybe there is something similar where you 
are. The advantage to having a local place is you don't have to mail your 
computer somewhere, you take it in &amp; they fix it when you have a problem. I 
was an idiot &amp; had no antivirus or anything else for a long time. It caught 
up with me. I took it in, they cleaned it up, &amp; it runs great again.</p> 
<p>My brother has a mac. I don't like it. (I don't use it much, so I only 
notice the stuff that annoys me compared to my computer.) There are minor 
differences between the two that I'm sure really wouldn't matter, but bugged 
me. Really minor, there is no delete key. Next minor difference: most laptops 
I've used have a mouse that you just tap &amp; it clicks, on a Mac you have to 
push the mouse because its a button. If you like windows office, you have to 
get a different version &amp; (using someone else's words) &quot;If you are 
going to run windows things on your mac, you might as well get a PC.&quot;</p> 
<p>I asked out of curiousity what a new computer similar to mine would cost, 
it was about the same as a new mac.</p> 
<p>Another downside to a mac, if you don't have software to make your existing 
internet connection work on a mac, you will have a hard time getting your mac 
fully operational. I had to download the software for my internet on my 
computer for my brother's mac so he could access the internet so it could get 
the rest of the programming it needed to operate correctly.</p>

<p>I grew up using PCs all my life. Like I was using DOS to open up my floppy 
disc video games when I was 4. I never thought I would be a Mac person because 
we had Macs at school and they were always causing problems. But after my PC 
was constantly getting viruses and finally crashed, I finally got my first Mac 
(an ibook) 7 years ago. Since then I have bought 2 other macs just just because 
I am kind of spoiled and had money burning in my pocket, not because any of 
them had problems. All three of the macs that I own are still running and are 
used by my parents. I LOVE my Macs. My only complaint is that I have trouble 
finding certain software for it because I don't have the money for expensive 
image editing programs. but that's about it.</p> </li>

<p>MACs are just wonderful! Sofware is much better than PCs, and they are also 
so cool!<br>
I'm writing this words from an iBook G4. Do u have a MAC or a PC?

<p>Although I'm challenged technology-wise, and both formats have given me 
their share of grief, I'd stick with the PC. I just find them more easy to use.

<p>Year back July since switched from PC to my IMAC Desktop computer and will 
never go back to the PC for using on the Internet ever ever ever. I have not 
had 1 virus, not had 1 time where the computer has crashed and have tons of fun 
with the software already loaded on the Mac and there is so much more out there 
for different applications that cab be bought or downloaded.<br>
The Mac is 
faster, has better graphics and once you get used to it's system is more user 
friendly by far than a PC, most of it is just common sense stuff&hellip;<br>

The bottom line is that you have to see what you want to use the computer for, 
if Internet use 100% you do not have to buy antivirus software and you would be 
pleased with lesser cost that way. However the Mac's are more expensive to buy 
apps and software for but think in the long run they last longer and can be 
adapted to a wireless mouse and keyboard just like a PC and all the other 
whistles and bells that you want. There is one thing need to mention, NO 
INBOARD MODEM on the MAC, you have to either buy a USB modem If On Dialup or if 
you have HIGH SPEED INTERNET have to use a Router on the Ethernet plug in and 
the built in Wireless AIRPORT for the router connection lets you do away with 
the cord connection just like a PC can and that way you can set it up in any 
room you want..</p> 
<p>I hope this helps and whichever way you go happy new computering&hellip;..

<p>You should get a Mac. They're great, and easy to use. Plus, they hardly get 
viruses or have problems. I love my MacBook!</p> </li>

<p>I'm having the same dilemma at the moment except I unfortunately have to 
buy it for myself- you are so lucky!</p> 
<p>I'm thinking Mac though, the build quality of the laptop is heaps better 
than most I hear and the battery life is great. I want something portable, long 
battery, but still relatively powerful and a mac ticks all those boxes.</p>

wait a long time to start up my pc </p> </li>
