 The Bottom Line <em>Dec 2 2010</em>
 - Apple's single processor version of the Mac Pro has stiff competition from 
Apple's 27-inch iMac. At $2500, the system is just too expensive compared to a 
similarly equipped iMac. Sure, the Mac Pro case is still one of the better on 
the market and has extra internal upgrade space but it just doesn't make up for 
the additional cost. Those wanting a higher performance desktop class Apple 
product really need to consider the dual processor Mac Pro or just stick with 
the 27-inch iMac. <br>

Performance Desktop PC 
<p><em>Dec 2 2010</em> - Apple's desktop lineup is primarily dominated by the 
iMac all-in-one system. Those looking for higher performance have the option of 
going with the Mac Pro systems which have a more traditional desktop look but 
definitely not standard internals. There are two versions, the two processor 
version and the single processor version. This review takes a look at the 
single processor model.</p> 
<p>The single core version of the Apple Mac Pro uses a quad core Intel Xenon 
W3530 processor. This is an older Nehalem version of the workstation processor 
that has performance that would rank it very similar to the Core i7-860 desktop 
class processor which a few differences that give it a slight edge. This is 
matched up with 3GB of DDR3 memory that under Mac OS X runs the system fairly 
well but for a performance machine is fairly limited. Those hoping to expand 
this out will find that it is limited to just 16GB of memory which is somewhat 
disappointing for a workstation classed system.</p> 
<p>Storage features on the base system are typical of a high end desktop. 
There is a terabyte sized hard drive that spins at 7200rpm which provides 
plenty of space for applications and data. Also included is a dual layer DVD 
burner for playback and recording of CDs and DVDs. What sets the Mac Pro apart 
from the iMac is the fact that there are four hard drive bays and two optical 
drive slots meaning that the system has lots of internal expansion space that 
the iMac lacks. Unlike the other Apple products, the Mac Pro does not come with 
an SD card slot.</p> 
<p>Thankfully, Apple has upgraded the graphics from their previous models of 
Mac Pros. Before they used an older version NVIDIA GeForce graphics processor. 
They have upgraded this to the ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics card with 1GB of 
memory. This change was really necessitated by the switch to the mini 
DisplayPort connector for their external monitors which the card has two of. It 
also features a dual-link DVI for older or non-Apple displays. The cards 
performance certainly tops the older GeForce GT 120 but it is far from short 
from the highest levels available from ATI or NVIDIA.</p> 
<p>The big issue with the single processor version of the Mac Pro is the cost. 
With a retail price of $2500, it is possible to get an equally high performance 
27-inch iMac that comes with more base memory and a built-in display for $500 
less. Overall, there is little reason to go with the single processor version 
of the Mac Pro unless you need the additional internal drive slots.</p> <br>
