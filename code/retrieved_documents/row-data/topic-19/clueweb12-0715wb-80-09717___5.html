<h1>The Hunt: Mac or PC</h1> 
<p> Posted by Rey on Dec 21, 2011 in Digital Life | 3 comments </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already noted that you need to figure out your priorities with 
your new Digital Bible. In this penultimate post to the series closer, I want 
to clear up a major question: Mac or PC?</p> 
<p>Both Macs and PC&rsquo;s are ridiculously easy to use and they each come 
with their own learning curve. Don&rsquo;t believe the fan-boy hype. This is 
why you&rsquo;ll have tofocus on your usage list.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to play the most recent video games you&rsquo;re 
going to want to steer clear from a Mac. Lots of them don&rsquo;t come out for 
it and the ones that do don&rsquo;t get a ton of backend support for odd 
crashes. Macs make up a small segment of video game producer&rsquo;s market 
share so if Mac Users are having problems it&rsquo;s not something that can 
turn the name of the company into a pariah. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t 
matter much with mobile platform games (likeAngry Birds).</p> 
<p>Lean towards a Mac if you&rsquo;re planning to do design work. Sure, 
PC&rsquo;s are<em>exactly</em> the same in this respect but as a designer 
you&rsquo;re probably already using a Mac so maximize your business dollars; 
stick with what you know. No one but designers will care for this bit but it 
must be mentioned: font management (like auto activation of fonts) is much 
better on the Mac. So far, anyway. With web fonts on the grow, that can change.
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before: if you&rsquo;re going to just use the thing for 
surfing the web, writing emails and maybe posting on your blog spending a 
boatload of money on anything expensive is a waste. Those very minor tasks 
(sorry they are) don&rsquo;t necessitate all thatcranking power. But then 
again, that mightjust mean a tablet&mdash;although not necessarily an iPad 
(which will still require a computer to set it up).</p> 
<p>Apple&rsquo;s Monitors, though pretty, aren&rsquo;t all that great 
considering their steep price tag. Shop around for a monitor because both Macs 
and PC&rsquo;s can use them (though Mac&rsquo;s usually with an adapter on 
everything but an iMac which has a Monitor built in) and it&rsquo;s the one 
piece of equipment that might probably outlast your system.&nbsp; MyViewSonic 
is great for games, reading, movies and detailed design work and is crisper 
than my Cinema Display. The Cinema Display cost over a thousand; the ViewSonic 
cost three hundred.</p> 
<p>If you want upgradeability go with a PC; Mac&rsquo;s have a time stamp that 
lasts as long as the next conference in June or the Christmas season. Anyone 
(including that guy behind the counter in Best Buy) can swap out any part of 
your PC for the most recent edition. The only time that becomes problematic is 
when a major change comes along (like Intel&rsquo;s dual core chip) which 
changes the face of PC tech.</p> 
<p>So, Mac or PC? It all depends. Plus, there&rsquo;s always Linux.</p>

<p>Good article Rey. Apart from gaming I think a lot of it comes down to 3 
things: money, taste and what you are used to. I do quite a bit of design work 
and I love the Adobe Suite on my PC. I just don&rsquo;t see how spending the 
extra money on a Mac is worth it. I also don&rsquo;t like the hardware control 
that Apple wants.</p> 
<p>I think both systems are good and they both make each other better.</p> <br>

<p>I certainly agree that competition between the Mac &amp; PC platforms is 
healthy.</p> 
<p>For the last 20 years I&rsquo;ve used Windows based PCs, but recently I 
have been tempted to switch over to the Mac. Ease of use, security, and 
stability of the operating system being the main reasons. The only factor that 
has held me back is the price.</p> <br>

<p>Just remember that Apple has some serious security issues. If you do go 
that route, invest in antivirus and a decent firewall like little snitch.</p>
