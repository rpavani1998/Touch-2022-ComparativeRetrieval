<h1> Are you a Mac or a PC? </h1> 
<p> By makenna | 1:33 PM | Posted in Feature | <b></b> </p> 
<p><strong>Mac</strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>Amber Laird:</strong> Staff Writer</em></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not that all Mac users are technologically illiterate, they just 
like Macs exactly as they come. They&rsquo;re the complete package. Coming 
equipped with iLife, Apple computers appeal to creative types. Editing videos 
is a cinch, as is organizing photos. Recording, buying, and listening to music 
are all made easy with Apple programs. Although Apple&rsquo;s word-processing 
program is not ideal, installing Microsoft Office on a Mac is no problem.</p> 
<p>In terms of Internet navigation, many Mac users are satisfied with Safari. 
If not, Firefox and Chrome can easily be downloaded. Macs are user-friendly and 
generally cooperative. They&rsquo;re very straightforward, never providing 
encrypted, confusing messages.</p> 
<p>A Mac computer is an efficient workspace. One can run multiple programs at 
once, switching between them with ease and minimal problems. Users construct 
their own workspace, using sticky notes, expos&eacute;, or simply dragging 
windows across the screen. Mac designers focus on intuitive, highly visual 
designs.</p> 
<p>Apple programs are constantly offering automatic updates to keep software 
improving as time progresses, without the user having to seek it out. The 
hardware is also more compact and easier to carry-Mac laptops are half as 
clunky as PC laptops. Even for desktop computers, all parts of the computer are 
contained in one sleek frame. Designers at Apple, Inc. are constantly finding 
ways to minimize volume while maximizing screen space.</p> 
<p>Viruses on Macs are minimal, a result of the combination of better virus 
protection and the fact that there just aren&rsquo;t as many Mac viruses out 
there as PC viruses.</p> 
<p>Macs are ideal for people who want efficiency, multitasking abilities, and 
class. With user-friendly software and setup and an attractive exterior, Mac 
laptops are perfect for sitting in Starbucks, sipping some coffee and casually 
editing a film or reading a manuscript.</p> 
<p><strong>PC</strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>Sofi Goode:</strong> Staff Writer</em></p> 
<p>PCs, or personal computers, appeal to a tech-savvy audience, allowing the 
user to set up their own computer, run video games and easily access all of 
their files.</p> 
<p> On Microsoft computers, the software is more malleable. Users have the 
option of buying individual parts and putting their computer together 
themselves. If they choose to purchase a whole computer, they can easily set up 
users and firewalls. The software is simple to change and updates can be easily 
found on the Internet.</p> 
<p> To those who understand computers, PCs are easier to use. You can choose 
the software you like and essentially &ndash; or literally if you&rsquo;d like 
&ndash; put your computer together yourself.</p> 
<p> A huge asset to Microsoft is the gaming industry. Microsoft computers have 
ample gigabytes of memory and RAM (random access memory, which allows for 
faster computer use) to download and play large games. Typically, computer 
games come out for PCs months prior to the Mac release &ndash; if there&rsquo;s 
a Mac release at all. Since PCs are designed to hold larger files and run much 
larger and more complicated programs than Macs, there is no doubt that PCs are 
superior when it comes to gaming.</p> 
<p>Malleable software and gaming are great, but they&rsquo;re nothing compared 
to Microsoft&rsquo;s open-source operating system. Mac computers run only Apple 
software, but PCs are much more flexible. Want to create your own program or 
download a game that your friend created? No can do on your Mac, but it&rsquo;s 
a cinch on a PC.</p> 
<p> If you understand technology and like to arrange things your own way, PCs 
are for you. Although it may occasionally give you the Error Message, your PC 
will never hide your files or deny access to the software necessary to update 
your programs or fix a problem. Do these functions appeal to you?&nbsp; Then 
there&rsquo;s no question; you&rsquo;re a PC person!</p>
