<h1>Music on Macs</h1> 10 June, 2011 - 06:36 &mdash; Jesse Ratterree 
<p>I've been a PC user all my life, but I'm coming up to needing a new 
computer, and I'm hearing more and more people say Go mac for music production. 
I'm a little leary, but i'm sick of windows crap and waiting so long for my 
computer to boot when I only have a little time to dabble. I'm probably moving 
to FL studio 10 and want to know how other's experiences have been with music 
done on Macs?</p> &lsaquo; How to build bass traps and acoustic panels 
Subwoofer in the near field? What are you using for bass? &rsaquo; <br>

<p>From what i hear using a macs much more resource friendly when it comes to 
music production.. thats all i know.. I haven't had the chance to produce with 
a mac yet</p> <br>

<p>I have used Macs all my life and I still don't really know the exact 
reason, but I much prefer to use them.</p> 
<p>They seem clearer and less complicated to use to me.</p> 
<p>Producing music was very easy, just plug in and go, whereas I know someone 
who makes music on a PC and it seemed like a massive ordeal to get started, 
with software, compatability, speakers, sound cards, etc. I'm sure it is very 
simple to some PC users though.</p>

<p>the only music program i ever used on a mac is ableton , which was awesome 
, the beats i made were phenomenal , but beyond that i have only used FLdemo on 
a mac which was great too , and macs are just better for video and audio , i 
say you are headed in the right direction with a mac</p> 
<p>here's a couple of tracks i made on ableton , nice and crisp , and this was 
without mastering or mixing down</p>

<p>if you go mac you gotta go logic...fl studio takes a very far back seat</p> 
<br> 11 June, 2011 - 14:34 &mdash; Adam Purski <br>

<p>It's a personal choice. If Mac, go for Mac. If PC, go for PC. It's whatever 
your comfortable with in making music.</p> <br>

<p>LOL, but since your getting problems with Windows, go for Mac then. xD<br>
 
At my school, we have Macs. I hear every Mac comes with a music creating 
program called Garage Band.<br>
 I played around with the loops on it and it 
was fun. The layout of the whole application is decent.<br>
 But, if you don't 
want this existing program that's in the Mac, I would go for Logic or Pro 
Tools. They work very well.</p> <br>
