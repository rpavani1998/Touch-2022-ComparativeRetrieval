<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<p>This proposal falls under the STF category &ldquo;Scientific and 
Fabrication&rdquo;. The proposed equipment is a Fortus 400mc 3D FDM (fused 
deposition modeling) system from Stratasys which would provide a great resource 
for University students across several disciplines. This machine has the 
capability to rapidly print parts from CAD models using standard ABS plastics, 
as well as specialized high strength and high temperature resistant materials, 
a feat which cannot be achieved using other 3D printing technologies. 
Currently, the only rapid 3D modeling machines available for student use on 
campus are powder-based systems which create very brittle and delicate models 
with limited precision due to the particulate nature of the printing medium. 
The Fortus system would provide University students robust rapid prototyping, 
the ability to create high strength end-use parts directly from a CAD model, 
and the ability to quickly make high temperature autoclave molds for 
aerospace-grade composite structures at a significantly reduced cost, which are 
all capabilities that the University currently lacks.</p> 
<h3>Background</h3> 
<p>University students across many disciplines, from engineering to the arts 
and sciences, often require prototype models. While the ME department has 3D 
printing equipment, the powder-based system produces low-strength, brittle, and 
rough parts which are not suitable for thin-gauge models, cannot produce 
finished surfaces, nor create end-use parts. These shortcomings impose great 
limitations on the size, shape, look, and durability of the part students are 
able to make, which falls short of the current capabilities of 3D printing 
technology. The Fortus 400mc FDM machine represents the cutting edge of 3D 
printing technology and resolves these shortcomings, allowing for students to 
expand the type and quality of the models and parts that can be produced. This 
machine also introduces the capability to manufacture directly from CAD to 
final end-use parts thanks to the impressive range of high strength materials 
that can be used. In addition to this, the Fortus 400mc also prints in 
materials specifically engineered to produce high temperature resistant molding 
tools for making aerospace-grade composite parts in an autoclave.<br>
<br>
 The 
addition of this machine would allow University students access with the modern 
technology for rapid prototyping and direct digital manufacturing which is used 
across several industries, but cannot found at other Universities. The exposure 
to such technology would set UW students apart and ahead, applicable in any 
engineering, scientific, or design industry.<br>
</p> 
<h3>Benefits</h3> 
<p>Students in disciplines which frequently have prototyping requirements, 
such as architecture, digital arts, and industrial design, would directly 
benefit from the Fortus 400mc FDM machine. Also, students in design &amp; build 
engineering competitions (such as the Formula SAE in the ME department, or the 
DBF RC airplane competition in the AA department) and the engineering senior 
design projects frequently design unique parts which today need to be 
manufactured using conventional, costly, and time-consuming machining 
processes. Making such unique parts directly using the Fortus 400mc machine 
from the CAD model would cut the cost and time to manufacture these parts, 
allowing for more flexibility, experimentation, and capability in the design 
process for these engineering students.<br>
<br>
 In addition, students in 
these design projects and competitions frequently use one of the AA, ME, or MSE 
autoclaves to manufacture aerospace grade composite parts for their products. 
These projects are currently limited by the expensive and time-consuming 
process of making specialized molds for the autoclave. Mold manufacturing is 
therefore outsourced to expert machinists in order to create the mold on time 
and ensure accuracy, thus limiting these projects to having one chance to get 
the mold design correct. The capability of the Fortus 400mc to make autoclave 
molds would allow for students to cheaply, quickly, and accurately produce 
autoclave molds in house, offering greater flexibility in design changes and 
the opportunity to use more aerospace-grade composites in their design.</p> 
<h3>Student Access</h3> 
<p>General access is permitted to any University of Washington student working 
on a UW sponsored project, with trained graduate student supervision. Training 
for use is not necessary due to the simplicity of operation. The ACSL located 
in Guggenheim Hall (GUG 107) offers the available floor space for the Fortus 
400mc and accompanying cleaning station. The lab employs five full-time 
graduate assistants who oversee the operation and maintenance of several pieces 
of large equipment seven days a week. The existing equipment, such as 
non-destructive inspection tools, an autoclave, and heated press, are available 
for departmental and college use. Within the AA Engineering department, all 
equipment is available for student use for any educational or otherwise 
research activity. In addition, the ACSL has had great success with overseeing 
general student access of a waterjet cutter recently installed for student use 
from the STF. Student use is permitted upon request and scheduling with the 
graduate assistants or laboratory director.<br>
<br>
 The Fortus 400mc machine 
will be marketed to students by the ACSL director and graduate students through 
several means. First, the ACSL and Lamborghini will fund a commercial 
advertising the machine for student use using the College of Engineering 
television production crew to be aired on UWTV. The ACSL has worked with this 
crew on multiple occasions, and funding for such a commercial has already been 
approved pending STF approval. The ACSL will also advertise the STF-funded 
Fortus machine during on-campus events, such as the Engineering open house and 
Mary Gates Research Symposium. Several students involved in design projects in 
the AA and ME engineering departments are already aware of this STF proposal, 
and are looking forward to using the Fortus machine.<br>
</p> 
<h3>Available Resources</h3> 
<p>The ACSL has the staff, utilities, and space to maintain and operate the 
Fortus 400mc machine. The proposed space can be viewed online at: (
https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B_3xl_kqB2n5YjgzMzQ3YzYtOGMzYS00NTkwLTg3YzYtZTk2NmQzNDU3YjM5&amp;hl=en
 ). The Fortus machine would be an excellent addition to this facility and 
would be covered under the maintenance plan that the lab already has in place. 
Under this plan, the laboratory has pledged to cover all of the costs 
associated with the long term use of the machine. With the experience of using 
similar rapid prototyping tools operated by industry research partners, the 
operation and maintenance requirements are already well known.<br>
<br>
 No 
other University or company in the Pacific Northwest has the FDM capabilities 
offered by the Fortus 400mc. In fact, Stratasys is not yet involved with other 
Universities and is excited to introduce UW students to their cutting edge 
technologies. Because of this, they are generously offering a $93,000.00 
discount from the original price specifically for the opportunity to provide 
general student access to their equipment by way of the STF.<br>
</p> 
<h3>Installation Timeline</h3> 
<p>Once the STF budget has been received, the equipment will be ordered within 
a week&rsquo;s time. Stratasys is aware of the STF proposal timeline, and is 
prepared to begin processing the request for a Fortus 400mc once funding is 
secure. The delivery time estimated by Stratasys is six weeks after the order. 
After delivery, the machine will be installed by Stratasys and training of the 
ACSL graduate students will follow. Installation and training time is estimated 
to be 3-4 weeks.</p> 
<h3>Departmental Endorsement</h3> 
<p>To the STF Committee,<br>
<br>
 I lead the capstone airplane design course 
sequence in my department - a sequence in which seniors, who enter the course 
with no knowledge of airplane design, build a solid foundation and proceed to 
design, build, ground-test, and flight-test quite sophisticated research type 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs are built from composite materials, 
reinforced, where necessary, by metal and wood parts. Over the years we have 
always outsourced the machining of our main composite molds to save time and 
ensure accuracy. This greatly limits the size, complexity and number of molds 
which can be made (typically one every 2 years).<br>
<br>
 A 3D printer which 
makes autoclave molds will be a tremendous contribution to the airplane design 
education program at the University of Washington, allowing our students to 
design and build more complex composite parts. In addition, the prospect of 
exchanging metallic reinforcement with light weight ABS plastic parts will 
continue our tradition of always improving and staying on the cutting edge.<br>

<br> I strongly support the application for making such a machine a part of our 
infrastructure in support of an educational program that is really unique.<br>

 A rapid prototyping 3D printing machine would 
update the capabilities of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
department&rsquo;s Composites Laboratory, which is used for educational 
laboratory instruction. This machine would modernize the ways we design, 
prototype, and manufacture components using new materials. This particular 3D 
printer is the leading edge of rapid prototyping today and this capability 
would allow the department to teach students practices that are currently used 
in the top tier of industry and would allow them to enter the workforce armed 
with this knowledge.<br>

<h3>Student Endorsement</h3> 
<p>As a member of the senior aircraft design project this rapid prototyping 
machine could be a very useful capability enabling more parts to be made in 
house, reducing the costs of the project overall. Also as a member of the 
Formula SAE team, the Fortus machinery could be used to replace small metallic 
parts with light-weight printed parts. The option to print molds for our 
increasingly composite racecar to use in the ME autoclave would open up weeks 
of extra time during the design phase of the car. I am excited to endorse the 
Fortus printer, as it is a fantastic resource that can be well utilized by 
students,<br>

 I am a senior AA 
student who is a part of the aircraft design senior project. Over the years, 
the increasing use of composites in aircraft senior design has been encouraged 
since this is the top of the line technology for aircraft structures. Every 
couple of years, we ask a company to design and machine the mold for the main 
body of our aircraft. This body is then reused for 2-3 years until it is deemed 
affordable to make another mold. This is extremely limiting for the type of 
aircraft we are capable of designing. This has been a frustration for many of 
the structures group students in aircraft design. I strongly endorse a 3D 
printer that could be printing these molds for us and the DBF team, which would 
really give us more choices and flexibility when designing our aircraft. Thank 
you,<br>

 I am a recent graduate of the 
Master&rsquo;s program for AA Engineering, and I wish to endorse the funding 
for the Fortus 3D printer. I conducted my time at the University with a 
particular interest in composites. I have spent time learning about composites 
manufacturing, and have had the opportunity to use the autoclave at UW to make 
composite parts. One of the largest obstacles with autoclaves is the need for 
specialized molds for every part. Machining molds is a lengthy process which is 
seldom taken on by students themselves, and I found that any mold more complex 
than a flat plate is almost always outsourced because making them at UW is 
impractical. Because of this, I was not able to make any specialized structures 
on my own, rather only stick to what could already be made. The 3D printer 
which can print in high temperature materials and make autoclave molds is a new 
technology, and an exciting one at that! I can see great benefit for many 
students such as myself who wish to explore the newest composite applications 
but have been limited by unnecessary time and expenses. I enthusiastically 
endorse the 3D printer.<br>
<br>

 The addition of a Fortus 400 3D printer would be a valued asset to the 
students at UW. I have personally had a history of frustration with the 3D 
printing technologies currently offered at UW, and have dedicated my efforts 
towards researching and determining the right tool suitable for a multitude of 
student needs. I am excited to endorse the Fortus machine, as not only will 
more versatile and diverse prototyping be possible, final parts and composite 
autoclave molds will also be easily made in a cost and time effective way. This 
machine can really make a difference for not only engineering students, but the 
student body in general. In addition, students will benefit from the experience 
to use one of the top of the line prototyping machines, offering a competitive 
edge which cannot be claimed by any other University.<br>
<br>
 It is my hope 
that the STF committee recognizes from this proposal the great need for such 
equipment, the prestige it can bring to the University, and that this funding 
would indeed be beneficial for all students who want to turn their CAD drawings 
into a real part. An additional emphasis must be made on the capability of the 
Fortus machine to print molds for composite parts in the autoclave, as the 
current practice is to outsource the making of these molds, as done for the AA 
and ME senior design projects, the formula SAE, and aircraft DBF teams for 
their high-end composite parts.<br>
<br>
 The ASCL laboratory is well 
maintained and already set up with several pieces of equipment with more 
demanding needs and utilities than the Fortus machine. The floor space is 
available, and the full-time staff is already knowledgeable with the printing 
technologies. This is truly a wonderful funding opportunity for the University, 
especially considering the largely discounted price! Thank you,<br>

instant, or on-demand manufacturing, is a manufacturing process which creates 
physical parts directly from 3D CAD files or data using computer-controlled 
additive and subtractive fabrication and machining techniques with minimal 
human intervention. When a small, low-cost device is used, it is also called

<p> Buy Hot Tub &acirc;&#128;&#147; Consider this Important Thing<br>
<br>
 
When shopping for aHot Tub Spa, don't choose quantity over quality. Most Hot 
Tub Spa users prefer to adjust jet pressure for the hydrotherapy they're 
seeking. Your neighbors will appreciate a quiet spa, as well. Most importantly,
Hot Tub Filter<br>
 should be sized for the spa's gallon age. A major problem 
with poorly madeHot Tub Spa is filters too small to adequately filter the 
amount of water in the spa.<br>
<br>
 What Will This Spa Cost to Operate 
Monthly?<br>
<br>
Portable Hot Tubs are much more energy efficient than 
built-in spas, but only if properly insulated. Question each dealer about their
Hot Tub Spa Manufacture. How long have they manufacturer spas? Shopping for a 
spa should be fun and informative. Buy the dealer before youBuy Hot Tub Spa. 
<br> <br>
 What is the Warranty on this Brand of Spa?<br>
<br>
 Read the  Hot 
Tub Spa Warranty. The selling dealer, not a third party, should conduct service 
on your spa at your home. Don't buy a spa at a carnival or fair. Many unwary 
spa buyers lose cash deposits and never receive their spa after succumbing to a 
slick salesperson at a fair. Do Choose aHot Tub Spa Dealer Sells Hot Tubs 
Exclusively.<br>

<p> The morning sun in Paris is like the golden voice of Pavarotti, not only a 
great penetrating power, but rather indirect. This is the first impression of 
Paris, the streets are quiet. I can see many couples who wearcartier inspired 
earrings. But the fact is that I can see a few pairs of lovers. Paris said: 
July and August, Parisians are on holiday and the streets of the NPC are 
tourists.</p>

<p> Chanel Handbags Online are very cost efficient but high quality 
manufacturers take great care to ensure that the replica they create is 
durable. It has a snap closure, made of coated canvas, fabric leather and metal 
for not only good looks but a long life. It is important to remember that when 
a Chanel bag may cost several thousand dollars, a &quot;discount&quot; may 
still be quite an expensive price. To avoid getting drawn in by the prospect of 
a deal, it is best to know the average price of newchanel 2.55 bag and compare 
that to discount offers before a purchase.</p>
