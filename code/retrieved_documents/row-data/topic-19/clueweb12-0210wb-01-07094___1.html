<h1>Is Apple planning to kill off Mac OS X?</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p>As Gerald Ratner will testify, standing on stage and panning your own 
products isn&rsquo;t a particularly effective sales strategy. Yet when Steve 
Jobs announced last night that he was &ldquo;going to demote the PC and the Mac 
to just be a device&rdquo;, it wasn&rsquo;t a million miles away from the 
&ldquo;total crap&rdquo; quip that cost Ratner his job and, very nearly, his 
company.</p> 
<p>Does Apple really want or even need full-fat Mac OS X? The evidence 
increasingly suggests not. In four short years, iOS has acquired a 16.8% share 
of the smartphone market, according to Gartner: almost double the 9.3% market 
share Apple&rsquo;s spent 10 years building with Mac OS X. &nbsp;On tablets, 
iOS and the iPad accounted for 80% of all sales in the first quarter of 2011, 
according to Context. iOS is mainstream: Mac OS X isn&rsquo;t and likely never 
will be.</p> 
<p>Over the past couple of months, there have been continual rumours that 
Apple is testing the iPad&rsquo;s A5 processor in its MacBook range, suggesting 
Apple believes iOS could stretch further than smartphones and tablets.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The only part of Apple&rsquo;s portfolio where iOS doesn&rsquo;t make sense 
is in the high-end</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Indeed, recent developments in Mac OS X itself have borrowed heavily from 
iOS, not least touch gestures and, crucially, the Mac App Store. Even the new 
version of the operating system itself is a download-only &ldquo;app&rdquo;, 
available exclusively from the Mac App Store.</p> 
<p>You can see why a transition to iOS is appealing to Apple. Why would Jobs 
want to keep giving software companies a free ride on Mac OS X, when it could 
migrate MacBooks to iOS, mandate software purchases via the App Store only, and 
take a 30% cut of the revenue?</p> 
<p>The only part of Apple&rsquo;s portfolio where iOS doesn&rsquo;t make sense 
is in the high-end. Yet, Apple&rsquo;s already discontinued its Xserve range of 
servers and the company barely speaks of its corporate customers these days: 
it&rsquo;s almost exclusively fixated on the consumer market.</p> 
<p>Could Apple eventually phase out Mac OS X? I suspect it&rsquo;s already 
doing so.</p> <br>

<p>The power user is the one who will lose out, if this is the strategy.</p> 
<p>For simple &ldquo;non productive&rdquo; tasks, such as web browsing or 
emailing, a tablet OS is fine.</p> 
<p>For photo editing, research and content creation, the iOS interface is too 
restrictive.</p> 
<p>At the moment, I have e-mail, twitter, web browser, Visio and skype open in 
separate windows on one monitor, on the other I have Project, Excel and Word 
open and I am creating new Word documents containing information garnered from 
Visio, Firefox, Excel and Project.</p> 
<p>Being able to flick between the apps &ldquo;alt+tab&rdquo; or iOS style is 
a pain. Being able to see 3 or 4 windows of information at the same time and 
assemble that information into a single new document, without having to 
continually interrupt myself, by flipping another app full screen, then 
flipping back is something I would be unwilling to give up.</p> 
<p>I think elements of iOS will transfer well into OS X, but I don&rsquo;t 
think the &ldquo;content creators&rdquo; will be able / willing to move to such 
a confined workflow.</p> 
<p>I think Adobe&rsquo;s ideas, where they use the iPad as an extension to the 
computer for creating content is good.</p> 
<p>As we move towards more on-line services, I think, for a lot of users, a 
simplified interface will be fine and iOS or a web browser interface will work. 
For power users, it is going to be too restrictive.</p> 
<p>Try taking a 32GB SD card with an afternoons worth of snaps from the 
botanical gardens and try and process them all on an iPad or on ChromeOS, using 
just a web browser. It would take a couple of weeks to load the data into 
Apple&rsquo;s / Google&rsquo;s cloud, if they even let you.</p> 
<p>My 8 core machine takes a couple of seconds to process a new image in 
Lightroom. I hate to think how long an iPad&rsquo;s ARM processor would take to 
process RAW images and manipulate them, I doubt it would be in &ldquo;real 
time&rdquo;.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>A cynic writes&hellip;</p> 
<p>The initial release of iOS with the first ever iPhone was a superb bit of 
engineering. It was so intuitive that you really didn&rsquo;t need a manual. It 
was obvious that it had been developed by a team where everyone from marketing 
through to design and programming had been working closely together.</p> 
<p>But, as I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned in PC Pro&rsquo;s Mobile &amp; 
Wireless column, since that initial release it all seems to have gone a bit 
Pete Tong. Apple&rsquo;s legendary usability seems to have become a casualty as 
new features have been shoehorned into the mobile OS. I don&rsquo;t know anyone 
that worked out how to access multi-tasking or organise their apps into folders 
without asking a friend or looking it up online. And as for dragging a list of 
messages down to find a hidden search box, whose brilliant idea was that?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like a gorgeous stately home that had a ghastly extension 
built in the 1950s, and a tacky conservatory in the 1980s. The initial 
architect would be spinning in his grave. Likewise, that tight-knit team that 
conceived and built the original iOS release must be spitting iFeathers.</p> 
<p>I simply don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for iOS to become a desktop 
OS without *completely* trashing it. The UI framework was designed to be 
&lsquo;just so&rsquo; for a phone. I hope Apple doesn&rsquo;t take their 
elegant stately home and turn it into a tacky theme park.</p>  &nbsp; </li> 
<li> David Artiss  Says: <br>
 June 7th, 2011 at 1:47 pm 
<p>I agree with Barry and Paul on this.</p> 
<p>When I heard the announcement, it occurred to me that they were probably 
lining up iOS to take over on their Mac range.</p> 
<p>I too thought that iOS was supposed to be incredibly intuitive, but when I 
tried my daughters iPhone Touch I ended up having to &ldquo;Google&rdquo; to 
find out how to place apps into folders &ndash; it&rsquo;s not obvious as all.

<p>&ldquo;Why would Jobs want to keep giving software companies a free ride on 
Mac OS X&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Shocking.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t these selfish software companies know that by producing 
software and expecting to receive (gasp!) actual payment for it, that they are 
needlessly diverting precious money that could could more profitably be 
residing in the offshore bank accounts of Steve Jobs (the world&rsquo;s poorest 
billionaire).</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>The answer to your question headline, of course, is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>  
&nbsp; </li> 
<li>  Chris  Says: <br>
 June 7th, 2011 at 2:09 pm 
<p>David Wright makes the argued case for why the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. 
But there is a really compelling reason to keep Mac OS X going, and that is to 
support Apple&rsquo;s developer community. Until there is a realistic way to 
develop iOS apps on iOS devices the answer will remain &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>As a personal note I grew up with a Commodore 64 and it took me a long time 
to work out that developing software for it was a mugs game, as all the 
commercial software had been probably been created on workstations running 
cross-assemblers. In Apple&rsquo;s case, Mac OS X is the perfect platform for 
developing the apps that drive iPhone and iPad sales.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>As Apple has proven time and time again, they are notoriously hard to 
predict. However, from their perspective, I can see sense in offering an IOS 
derived consumer focused experience (possibly on a Macbook Air style device) 
and reserve the OSX experience for the &lsquo;Pro&rsquo; community. The IOS/App 
Store walled garden fits their perception of the consumer need and is a 
flexible way to monitise services to this market.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>The other clue that this could be the end of OS X is the name. Lion is 
arguably the Daddy of the big cats. How will they top Lion? Sabre Tooth perhaps.

<p>Since so many users have pointed out the requirement for a 
&ldquo;Professional&rdquo; version of OSX for programme development alongside 
the iOS or &ldquo;Home Basic&rdquo; version for web browsing perhaps Steve Jobs 
will take the cue and launch Ultimate (for graphic designers), Home Premium 
(for iMacs)and Starter (for PowerPCs Macs?) editions. Just a thought.</p>

<p>Please get rid of OSX so I no longer need to keep Macs around to simply run

not better then FCP, if using a nVidia CUDA card for video acceleration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Apple planning to kill off Mac OS X?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>NO!</p> 
<p>How will iOS apps be developed? What about websites? What about the 
professional designers, DTP&rsquo;s, graphic artists, 3D modellers, game 
developers, movie editors, sound recordists? The people who do these things 
mostly use Macs. If they were to do these things on iOS, it would have to take 
on significant complexity that wouldn&rsquo;t belong on a mobile device or 
post-PC internet appliance.</p> 
<p>As for the ARM thing, OSX is quite capable of running on ARM, they&rsquo;re 
not about to put iOS on a MacBook Air.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>Thanks for the comments. </p> 
<p>The point about Mac OS X being the sole development platform for iOS is an 
excellent one.</p> 
<p>However, it would be perfectly possible for Apple to keep OS X alive as a 
development platform, and eventually migrate its laptops/Mac Mini to iOS.</p> 
<p>The other point I should clarify is that I don&rsquo;t anticipate this 
happening overnight &ndash; I believe it will be a gradual process over a 
number of years.</p>

<p>@RoverDaddy &ldquo;If I could buy the $99 SDK and develop iOS apps without

<p>But then it wouldn&rsquo;t be the perfect platform.  You&rsquo;d have the 
Commodore 64 situation all over again if you tried to use Windows (ref. my post 
above)</p> 
<p>Also @Barry Collins, no self-respecting developer would be seen without a 
Mac Book Pro. Converting the iMac to ARM would make more sense, and that 
doesn&rsquo;t seem likely, does it?</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>One thing that seems to get lost in the wash over and over again is that 
iOS and Mac OSX are technically the same operating system at the core. Both are 
built off a BSD-derivative called Darwin.</p> 
<p>In fact, called iOS an &ldquo;OS&rdquo; is debatable. You could 
convincingly argue that iOS is little more than a particular UI (optimized for 
touch) bolted on top of Darwin. All the functions of an actual &ldquo;Operating 
System&rdquo; (memory management, device interaction, process tables, 
networking, etc) are handled by the same Darwin underpinnings as Mac OSX.</p> 
<p>So, the question of whether iOS will kill off OSX is really meaningless. 
Both iOS and OSX are the same core operating system, but different UI stacks 
(and typically compiled to different processors: ARM for iOS and x86_64 for 
OSX).</p> 
<p>Would iOS (or an iOS-like) UI paradigm replace the current Quartz-based UI 
stack on OSX? That&rsquo;s a more accurate question.</p> 
<p>As long as I can get to a Darwin terminal app I care little for the flashy 
exterior &mdash; be it OSX or iOS (in fact, jailbreak your iOS device, install 
a Terminal app from Cydia, and you&rsquo;ll see the exact same 
&ldquo;belly-of-the-beast&rdquo; in iOS as in OSX).</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>OS X isn&rsquo;t going away, it&rsquo;s just going to fade seriously into 
the background. A file system based OS is a throwback to the days when 
computers filled a room. They couldn&rsquo;t handle the housekeeping so it got 
handed over to the user. Now that they can handle the housekeeping, why not let 
them do it. Apps can be written for the Power User that make use of keyboards 
and mice while still making use of the newest iOS features. Maybe it would take 
the form of a glass keyboard that presents buttons specific to that app. 
Persoanlly I&rsquo;d live to have a customized Final Cut Pro keyboard with a 
&ldquo;Refresh View&rdquo; button instead of having to remember shift F12. 
I&rsquo;d rather concentrate on my work than on what the OS is up to or 
remembering what arcane key combination to use.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>It makes sense for Apple to rid of osx and concentrate on the consumer 
market. I&rsquo;m sure if they stack up the numbers that, compared to their 
macbook pros and mac pros, the iphone/ipad is growing exponentially. Since the 
former are basically windows machines anyway, seems obvious for Apple to do 
what it always does best&hellip; and that is monopoly. It&rsquo;s lost control 
of osx (Hackintoshes and windows on their own machines). With 
ios/itunes/icloud, Apple can control it&rsquo;s consumers once they have 
invested in it&hellip; Unlike with osx.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>I hope that Mac OS X is not going away. Mac OS X has too many things that 
iOS will not replace. iCloud will make file transfer more transparent but will 
not read, manipulate or write the file as you wish and the OS and it the 
applications on it will read, manipulate or write files. iOS great for ad hoc 
read, manipulate or write certain files but these devices doesn&rsquo;t have 
computing power to do the serious computational operation. The laptop or 
desktop will remain the most home user&rsquo;s computing powerhouse and the Mac 
OS X will be running that on Apple.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>Probably the biggest argument against this analysis is the fact that 
Apple&rsquo;s Mac sales have been going up every quarter for the last five 
years, steadily outpacing the growth of all the other brands with limited 
exceptions.</p> 
<p>Personally, what I&rsquo;m expecting to see is a better integration between 
iOS and OS X to the point that the iOS device can completely replace 
conventional portables and serve as an extension of the desktop rather than a 
replacement. I don&rsquo;t expect to see the Mac Pro, iMac or Mac Mini 
disappear or even go all ARM unless Apple&rsquo;s design unit can make it 
exceed the capabilities of current and future x86 chipsets the way the PPC did 
15 years ago. Do that, and suddenly Apple&rsquo;s security woes are resolved 
and platform independence is insured.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>The point about demoting the Mac to &ldquo;just a device&rdquo; was meant 
in relation to the iOS devices. No longer would you need the Mac to load them, 
program them, or sync them all together. That&rsquo;s as it should be. The 
comment never meant that he is phasing out the Mac.</p> 
<p>Beware of false prophets foretelling the end of Apple. They&rsquo;re always 
there, ready to bend every ambiguous statement or dangling factoid to signal 
impending doom of the company they hate. In the 1990&rsquo;s, before Steve Jobs 
returned to Apple, they nearly succeeded in killing it. Employees in computer 
stores daily misinformed countless customers about the Mac and its abilities, 
as if it was some kind of toy. As a pro-user, I literally could not believe my 
ears as they told me the impossibly stupid. I&rsquo;d set them straight, but 
I&rsquo;m sure that didn&rsquo;t stop them.</p> 
<p>The Mac is not going away. It&rsquo;s THE pro platform for musicians, and 
certainly one of the mainstays of artists, designers, writers, videographers, 
and&hellip; iOS programmers.</p> 
<p>Repeat: the Mac is getting better, not going away. Oh&hellip; and if you 
look at the pages about the new Lion OS, you&rsquo;ll find a toolset readily 
available which turns it into: Lion Server. So never mind about there being no 
OSX Server; since it&rsquo;s basically the same OS as the consumer version. 
they just quit pretending it was different and started providing the server 
tools separately.</p> 
<p>Beware of false prophets foretelling the demise of Apple. They serve no 
function but to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt.</p>

<p>So what will serious Apple OS developers use to actually develop the apps 
that Apple will get a 30% cut of? Tools like Xcode and Interface Builder. Oh 
that&rsquo;s right, the author of this article has never once written a line of 
Objective-C nor used Xcode to develop an iOS app.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

 Thank you for saving me some typing. Will Barry now run an 
article saying that Android will replace Linux.<br>
 If we look at the recent 
article on Windows 8 it&rsquo;s obvious that there is a need for two distinct 
UI models. For web based information consumption and participation a simplified 
UI offers great advantages. However there are tasks that still need a 
mouse/menu interface and they are not going away anytime soon.<br>
 However 
there probably are millions of laptop owners who do little content creation so 
an &ldquo;iPad with a keyboard&rdquo; may well be an ideal device for them.</p>

<p>@ios dev re pc plus, it&rsquo;s not time to jump ship to techradar quite 
yet but we&rsquo;re getting there. So sad. I&rsquo;d always been a BBC B / 
Windows 95 fan when younger, into games, bits of programming. But having worked 
in stockbroking for 10 yrs I had lost all my IT awareness because it was all 
locked down and handled by tech support. When I left to set up my own business 
PC Pro was a godsend. It essentially taught me how to operate my own IT. But 
Barry&rsquo;s taking PC Pro in a different direction &ndash; basically tabloid, 
which is his background (this and the ACS Law stuff and the anti-Philip Green 
review stuff are the examples of that) &ndash; and perhaps that will work for 
subscription numbers. But it&rsquo;s not working for me. Where&rsquo;s the 
rejoicing in tech? it&rsquo;s all just big headlines, negativity and guesswork. 
Gutted really.</p> 
<p>Just look down the &ldquo;latest news&rdquo; today. It reads like the Daily 
Mail front page. Cut out the miserabilist, controversialist stories. Bring back 
the geeky joy. I might even start buying the mag again. It&rsquo;s not too late 
guys! time to turn this ship around.</p> 
<p>Sorry to be on your case Barry but I suspect I am articulating what some of 
your colleagues are thinking privately. There&rsquo;s little evidence you have 
a deep understanding of tech &ndash; you are a reporter and you&rsquo;d be a 
roaring success back at the Mail &ndash; are you certain the editor&rsquo;s 
chair at PC Pro is really your cup of tea? I started trolling you above, which 
is unforgivable. I just think you are taking PC Pro in the wrong direction. But 
I promise not to bother you again in comments.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>Gavmeister,</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to turn this thread into a discussion about the 
direction of PC Pro, but I can assure you we&rsquo;re not turning 
&ldquo;tabloid&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m actually proud of the stories we&rsquo;ve published on ACS Law 
and Sir Phillip Green&rsquo;s report &ndash; to my mind, they&rsquo;re examples 
of good investigative journalism, and of holding people in authority to 
account, not the rehashed press releases you&rsquo;ll find on other &ldquo;tech 
news&rdquo; sites. And judging by the comments posted on these stories (see
http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/364501/exposed-file-sharing-lawyers-collect-fines-using-dormant-company
 ), many of our readers appreciate the journalism, too.</p>

<p>@barry thanks for the response (except link doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; 
needs a space before the end bracket).</p> 
<p>@mark is that article link (I read it yesterday) intended to support or 
refute my position? The techradar article is more balanced (&rdquo;It&rsquo;s 
too soon to say that Apple is about to knife Mac OS X&hellip;But it is clear 
that Apple sees its future as being increasingly away from its history in 
traditional personal computing&rdquo;), but what&rsquo;s interesting is the 
comments are much higher quality here at PC PRo, particularly @Rudolph 
Pienaar&rsquo;s jaw-droppingly good one (i now TOTALLY get iOS vs OS X, thanks 
Rudolph!). So the quality readers are still here.</p> 
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s me, just a matter of personal taste. For me, 
Barry&rsquo;s headline and first paragraph are misleading, sensationalist, 
controversialist, factually and conceptually wrong and just wind me right up.

 The &ldquo;demise&rdquo; of OSX started the day that the 
iPhone \ iPod Touch emerged blinking from the shadows. And it reflects the 
change taking place in &ldquo;IT&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>For many years &ldquo;Computers&rdquo; were a hobby in themselves, and for 
many they still are. An analogy with motoring is appropriate. Most people give 
not a hoot about anything other than getting from A-B. However many people are 
seduced by claims that they&rsquo;ll be buying the &ldquo;Ultimate Driving 
Machine&rdquo; or by pretty styling, or perceived &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.<br>
 
Likewise basic computing platforms are now so reliable that most people neither 
know nor care which one they are using at any time. Apple&rsquo;s alleged 
recent success in flogging Macs is down almost entirely to their physical 
qualities. Nobody goes out to buy &ldquo;OSX&rdquo; (or IOS) but the lifestyle 
attractions of all that shiny metal and glass are obvious.</p> 
<p>As far as I can tell Apple have been pushing in this direction for years. 
Rudolph Pienaar points-out that this is down to the use of the same basic UNIX 
core OS in all their current devices. Hence porting iPhone apps to iPad is 
relatively easy despite the disparate hardware platforms involved. If you get 
this right, attention is focused not on low-level machine programming, but on 
exposed hardware functions to higher-level programming.</p> 
<p>This was VERY smart of Apple!</p> 
<p>OSX is dead! Long Live OSX</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>The ideal OS has always been none at all. Just applications that did what 
you want in a way that you expect. This is where Steve Jobs has always been 
heading. The UNIX core is making this possible. Not here yet but, 
someday&hellip;</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>Hmmm and there was me thinking of buying a Mac in the next few months and 
making the switch&hellip; Bad idea maybe? Should I stick with my trusty PC for 
now&hellip;?</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>This article contains some complete crap in itself. True iOS has hugely 
boosted Apple over the last couple of years but that doesnt mean Mac OS X is 
dead. iOS was something the mobile industry seriously needed, a decent mobile 
OS. So for obvious reasons it caught on like wildfire. Mac OS X is for people 
who do a little more with their lives than tweet and watch youtube, Its 
iOS&rsquo;s powerful big brother. True, its a slow grower but it growing none 
the less. As pointed out at this years WWDC Mac popularity grew by 28% and 
Windows dropped by 1%.</p> 
<p>I think mobile technology will partially take over the personal computer 
industry but mac osx will always have its place. As will windows.</p>  &nbsp;

<p>If they did phase out OS.X (which they won&rsquo;t) then it will leave 
developers with nowhere to go to develop Apps for either iOS or OS.X!</p> 
<p>Without developers creating Apps, the iPhone / iPad wouldn&rsquo;t be 
anywhere near where they are today.</p> 
<p>Mac sales are up hugely, that isn&rsquo;t a sign that people don&rsquo;t 
want &lsquo;PC&rsquo; like machines to do more than they can on their iOS 
device.</p> 
<p>Apple know that, they are not stupid &ndash; they have to provide a 
platform for &lsquo;power&rsquo; users (not only for developers, but many other 
users). However, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that an iOS front-end can&rsquo;t be 
bolted-on to OS.X for the average user, which is exactly what they have done in 
Lion!</p> 
<p>What Steve Jobs meant was that the PC/Mac isn&rsquo;t going to be the 
centre of the world where we store all of our files, and connect all our 
devices to before we can do anything, not that the Mac is going to turn into an 
iOS-like device.</p> 
<p>Only takes a little common sense to realise that, instead we get mindless 
doom-mongering prattle.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think he neccessarily meant the end of OSX. But the end of 
OSX as a platform that people buy in to. Even if you had a million developers 
for the 300 million iOS devices(I might have exaggerated that number, not sure) 
then that&rsquo;s only a million devices every couple of years. Yes Macs are up 
but the tablet has only just started its life and as people start realising 
that they don&rsquo;t need a computer to sync to any more sales will start to 
drop. This is the start of the death of OSX, not the end. Over the next couple 
of years I expect to see sales of Macs drop. Might not be this year but it will 
come</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>Where does it say that it is not possible to have a fully fledged 
development suite created for iOS? Can&rsquo;t be arsed trawling through all of 
the hand wringing in this thread to find out, but I don&rsquo;t recall anybody 
saying that iOS could never support development platforms.</p>  &nbsp; </li>

<p>Good riddance I say. OSX is an over-rated and unintuitive OS to use. The UI 
feels like it&rsquo;s kludged together and not really thought through &ndash; 
the Mac OS UI belongs in the 80s. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the shiny hardware 
that it runs on no one would give it a second glance these days.</p> 
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m saying that iOS like interfaces are better &ndash; in 
fact, these are much worse. Merely that Windows and Linux are superior.</p>

<p>Ron &ndash; I&rsquo;m stunned that not a single member of the legions of 
Apple fans has risen to the defense of OSX in response to your final comment 
here back in July.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m one of them. But I&rsquo;m kind of with you. I think you 
overstate your case, but, I think Win 7 is easier to use than OSX for the 
uninitiated user. Would a novice ever work out on in OSX how to get the desktop 
to appear when your screen is filled by windows? Why isn&rsquo;t it feasible to 
rename a folder or move a file in a dialog box, when you spot there&rsquo;s an 
error? Why can&rsquo;t you resize a window by grabbing its sides? MS has 
finally come up with an OS that&rsquo;s easier to use than the Mac &ndash; and 
although it&rsquo;s nothing like as crashproof, it&rsquo;s pretty solid &hellip;

<p>The users will kill off OSX. Google &ldquo;I hate OSX&rdquo; and read the 
comments.</p> 
<p>When OSX arrived, I refused to switch. (I&rsquo;m still using OS 9 and XP.) 
What I found most disturbing, is that you are supposed to program in 
Objective-C, the predecessor of C++. (The C++ standard was set in 1981.) Ron is 
too mild when he says that the Mac OS UI belongs in the 80s. This is technology 
of the seventies. There are not too many people who develop software for Apple. 
If you ask them to go back to Objective-C, then that&rsquo;s a very bad idea.
</p> 
<p>Another problem is that people use their computer to do their work and to 
use the internet. I think that you should have 2 computers: one for your work 
and one for internet. I use OS 9 for my work and XP with Firefox for internet. 
A computer is now evolving towards just a &lsquo;device&rsquo; to browse the 
internet.</p> 
<p>Then I wonder what will happen when OSX is discontinued and all those OSX 
computers arrive on eBay with crashed software and without installation disk. 
Then you will see that OS 9 was better. It was easier to install, use and 
repair.</p>  &nbsp; </li> </ol>
