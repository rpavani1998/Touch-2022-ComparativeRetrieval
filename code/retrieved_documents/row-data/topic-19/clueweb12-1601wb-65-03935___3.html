<h3>Mac VS Windows</h3> 
<p>by <strong>XPutNameHereX</strong> on Sat Mar 17, 2012 6:17 pm </p>  Hey 
there. I put this in social, one, because there are no better places, and two, 
because I think these are really more social barriers between the two sides. 
I'm also going to be referring to Windows as &quot;PC&quot; (I know it actually 
means Personal Computer) I'm also leaving out the OS, as I think it is a matter 
of opinion.<br>
<br>
Here we go. <br>
<br>
Why PCs are better: <br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Faster: Speed is determined mostly by RAM, Hard Drive Space, and 
Processor, all of which you can get for half the price on a PC vs a Mac.<br>

</li> 
<li>More Applications: It's a PC world out there, and many things are going to 
be made only for Windows. Yes, the big things will be made for both (maybe even 
Linux), however, around half of all programs, if I'm not mistaken, are made 
only for PC. A very, very small percentage are made only for Mac.<br>
</li> 
<li>More Connections: When all of your friends have PCs, there's gonna be 
stuff you have to have a PC to do with them, similar to the &quot;More 
Applications&quot; point.<br>
</li> 
<li>Security: Macs get viruses. I don't care what you say, they do. However, 
most Mac users don't have Anti-Virus Software, while almost all PC users do. 
Unless the user ignores all warnings, they are more secure.<br>
</li> 
<li>Graphics: Mac Video Cards range from bad to okay. PC ranges from bad to 
absolutely awesome, including 3D graphics.<br>
</li> 
<li>Features: Hey, ever seen a Mac with a touch screen, or Facial Recognition 
Software, or Fingerprint Software? I sure haven't.<br>
</li> 
<li>Cheaper with Everything else: If you go to the Mac website, and Dell, for 
instance, and you build the same exact computer, same look, same size, same 
hardware, the Macwill come out 2-3 times more expensive.</li> </ul> <br>
Why 
Macs are better:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Customer Service: Remember that this has nothing to do with the computer, 
however, I will still give it to them because it is much better than most PC 
services. Most.<br>
</li> 
<li>Better Software-Hardware Compatibility: As both are made at the same 
company, they generally work slightly nicer together, however, remember this is 
only slightly. There is very, very little difference, I am being honest here.
</li> </ul> <br>
What I will not give to Macs: <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>More Secure: No, Macs get viruses. Of course, when you bring it to an 
Apple store, they will tell you that it's not a virus, and that it is, in fact, 
&quot;something else.&quot; Even so, it is entirely the User's fault if they 
get the virus, not the computer's. As someone else put it, if someone hits 
their thumb with a hammer, it's not the hammer's fault, it is the clumsy 
person's.<br>
</li> 
<li>Better Looking (Casing, that is): Yes, Macs look better than most PCs, I 
don't deny that. However, there are some PCs that look equal to a Mac, or, 
extremely better (Alienware).<br>
</li> 
<li>More out of the Box: I don't care if they come with iPhoto, or Garage Band 
or anything. I would say this is equal, not good, but not bad. Yes, they are 
somewhat helpful, however, they do take up space, if even a small amount. With 
PCs, you can use things on the internet and you don't even have to install 
them, but there are many where you can if you want to. As far as I know, you 
cannot uninstall the Mac Preset ones, correct me if I'm wrong please.</li> </ul>
Anything else?
