<p>Why Macs Are The Best Choice:</p> 
<p>Our local school district&rsquo;s (publicly made) explanations for 
abandoning our $10,000,000&plusmn; Mac investment, center around the following 
contentions:</p> 
<p>Myth #1<br>
<em>&quot;Windows/PCs are cheaper.&quot;</em><br>
<strong>
Response:</strong>Just not so. Despite <em>sometimes</em> having a slightly 
higher initial purchase cost, Macintosh computers have substantially lower
<strong>TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP</strong>. Learn More!</p> 
<p> Myth #2<br>
<em>&quot;There&rsquo;s no real difference between Macs and 
PCs.&quot;</em> <br>
<strong>Response: </strong>There are BIG differences. For 
instance, compared to Windows PCs, the Mac OS is easier to learn, requires 
fewer keystrokes for similar tasks, and results in much higher user 
productivity.Learn More!</p> 
<p><strong>Is this still true for Windows Vista?</strong><br>
 Of course! Mac 
OS X is significantly better than Windows Vista.Learn More!</p> 
<p>Myth #3<br>
<em>&quot;Students need a Windows/PC experience.&quot; <br>
 (
</em>Variation:<em> &quot;Schools should be using Windows/PCs since more 
businesses do.&quot;)</em><br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Agree that Windows 
experience could be worthwhile! But educating students on computers involves 
MUCH more than exposing them to Windows. Macs can also run a Windows or Linux 
operating system<strong>simultaneously</strong>, for FREE, essentially 
providing two+ computers for the price of one. And there are at least TEN GOOD 
REASONS why schools should NOT use computers based on what businesses use.Learn

<p>Myth #4<br>
<em>&quot;There have been problems with our existing Macs.&quot;
</em><br>
<strong>Response: </strong>Macs are VERY reliable. Compared to 
Windows PCs, Macs are MUCH easier to support &mdash; and when<strong>properly 
maintained</strong>, they experience FAR fewer problems. Furthermore, Macs are 
more secure &mdash; e.g. they are MUCH less prone to virus attacks.Learn More!
</p> 
<p>Myth #5<br>
<em>&quot;Mac statistics are outdated, etc.&quot;</em><br>

<strong>Response: </strong>In communications with school MIS personnel, an 
assortment of other Mac criticisms came out. Contentions about our statistics 
being outdated, about the quantity of Mac software available, about Apple 
single-sourceness, etc. are simply NOT LEGITIMATE.Learn More!</p> 
<p>Myth #6<br>
<em>&quot;PCs are faster than Macs&quot;</em><br>
<strong>
Response:</strong>First of all, in a school setting, speed is hardly paramount. 
Secondly, for business and school related application usage, the performance of 
Macs is equal to or<strong>better</strong> than high-end PCs. Learn More!</p>

<br>
<strong><em>Please note:</em></strong> 
<ul> 
<li>In our attempt to keep things brief and to the point, our Position pages 
provide only a representative SAMPLE of the available research.</li> <br>

<li>The sources of the research data presented here are not only schools, but 
also<strong>businesses</strong> (i.e. the places that supposedly only use PCs). 
Furthermore, I have primarily chosen places that have had first hand experience 
with both the Windows and Macintosh computer platforms.</li> <br>

<li>Based on the nature of this site, I will continue to periodically add new 
information as warranted, and when I have the time. (Every section page has a 
date at the bottom so you can see its version.)</li> </ul>
