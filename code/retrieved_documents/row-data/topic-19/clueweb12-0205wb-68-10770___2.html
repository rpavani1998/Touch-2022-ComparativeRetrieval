<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of buzz these days about Macs, and many in ministry are 
asking for them.&nbsp; Historically this decision has been driven by the 
software / applications in use.&nbsp; PC-centric churches usually say, 
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; to Mac requests pretty quickly.&nbsp; But Macs can run PC 
software now, so the question is going to keep coming.&nbsp; We need an updated 
response, and this article may help.</p> 
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the problem?</strong><br>
 Apple recently began 
selling Macs that use the same Intel processors PCs use.&nbsp; Before that 
happened, PC software couldn&rsquo;t run well on a Mac.&nbsp; While there were 
ways to access PC software from a Mac, the experience was usually a bad one, 
and few pursued the option strongly.&nbsp; Since the decision for hardware is 
best made based on the software in use, the PC<em>vs</em> Mac issue had been 
relatively easy.&nbsp; Now, though, we&rsquo;re having to re-examine the PC<em>
vs</em> Mac decision.</p> 
<p>I am re-examining this issue from two perspectives:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>What does it take to run PC software on a Mac?&nbsp; What are the 
limitations?&nbsp; Can one have a total &lsquo;PC running PC software&rsquo; 
experience?</li> 
<li>Macs cost more than PCs.&nbsp; Is there intrinsic value in using a Mac to 
accomplish our tasks that justifies the additional cost?</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>There are many paths, Grasshopper&hellip;</strong><br>
 There are 
at least five ways to run PC software on a Mac:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Remote Desktop via Terminal Services</li> 
<li>Mac OS X&rsquo;s Boot Camp (booting up in whichever operating system you 
want&hellip; switching means restarting the computer)</li> 
<li>SWsoft&rsquo;s Parallels</li> 
<li>Microsoft&rsquo;s Virtual PC for Mac</li> 
<li>VMware&rsquo;s Fusion</li> </ul> 
<p>In my initial research I found many complaining about all of these 
possibilities except for Parallels and Fusion.&nbsp; Many IT professionals are 
working with VMware&rsquo;s virtual server products, and our firm has had great 
success with them.&nbsp; So I decided to do my testing using their Fusion 
product to create a virtual PC on the Mac.&nbsp; The Mac I used for testing was 
a MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.4.11 (Tiger) with a 2.4ghz Intel Core 2 Duo 
processor, 4gb RAM, 160gb hard drive, and 17-inch monitor.</p> 
<p><strong>How&rsquo;d it go?</strong><br>
 The software installation was 
surprisingly easy, and setup was too.&nbsp; VMware&rsquo;s Fusion uses the same 
approach on the Mac as it does in its server software.&nbsp; You create a<em>
virtual PC</em> following easy prompts asking how large the hard drive should 
be, how much RAM it should have, etc.&nbsp; They give you suggestions along 
with minimum and maximum ranges.&nbsp; I set up a virtual PC having one 
processor, 1gb of RAM, and a 60gb hard drive.&nbsp; It then asked me to insert 
my Windows installation disk, and from there on it was like setting up any 
other Windows PC.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>PC-on-a-Mac Fusion Observations</strong><br>
 The first thing I 
noticed was how fast the PC ran!&nbsp; That makes sense, of course, when you 
consider that it&rsquo;s virtual and all running in the Mac&rsquo;s RAM.&nbsp; 
Then I decided to try Fusion&rsquo;s &lsquo;Unity&rsquo; mode.&nbsp; It took my 
PC applications and allowed them to run as normal floating 
&lsquo;windows&rsquo; on the Mac desktop!&nbsp; So my PC applications looked 
very similar to my Mac applications!</p> 
<p>There are some nice features on the Mac.&nbsp; The monitor is much nicer 
than my PC monitors (desktop and notebook).&nbsp; And the speakers are 
terrific!&nbsp; But one thing surprised me:&nbsp; the Mac&rsquo;s keyboard 
illuminates in low light&mdash; VERY nice!&nbsp; This makes using the Mac in 
low light enjoyable and easy&hellip; something I&rsquo;ve always felt was 
missing from my PC notebooks.</p> 
<p>Fusion also gave me the option of setting up the ability to share folders 
between the two desktops!</p> 
<p><strong>A Couple of Frustrations<br>
</strong>The Mac keyboard is missing 
keys!&nbsp; Like the Insert and Print Screen keys!&nbsp; And the Delete key 
acts like a Backspace key!&nbsp; It took some research, but I found the 
following keystrokes for PC users working on a Mac:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Insert = Fn + m</li> 
<li>Delete = Fn + Delete (otherwise it&rsquo;s a backspace key)</li> 
<li>Print Screen = Apple + Shift + 3</li> </ul> 
<p>The Mac uses a one-button mouse.&nbsp; I discovered that right-click 
functionality is available using the Mac&rsquo;s mouse while pressing the Ctrl 
key.&nbsp; I also found that you can plug a two-button mouse into the Mac and 
get all of the functionality available in the PC.&nbsp; And that functionality 
works in Mac programs too!</p> 
<p>And though there&rsquo;s no Command Prompt function, there is a similar Mac 
function called Terminal which opens a window you can run Unix commands in.</p> 
<p>I also found that I couldn&rsquo;t extend any PC programs across multiple 
monitors&hellip; they all must run in a single monitor.&nbsp; VMware assures me 
that functionality is coming in an update.</p> 
<p><strong>Good News!</strong><br>
 I could run all of the PC programs I 
normally run on a PC very nicely using VMware&rsquo;s Fusion! That includes MS 
Office 2007 (including Outlook and Visio), SQL databases, Bible study software 
(Libronix), and utilities I use to setup Microsoft networks.&nbsp; I also setup 
virtual Linux and Windows Vista computers and had success in each.&nbsp; This 
technology works, and is ready to help us as we focus on building The Kingdom.
</p> 
<p>Okay, PC apps run well on a Mac&hellip; but are they worth it?</p> 
<p><strong>The Mac Reputation</strong><br>
 Macs are thought to be systems 
that run creative software better (music, graphics, and video editing) and that 
give users a better &lsquo;personal&rsquo; experience.&nbsp; This might be 
true, depending on the kind of user one is.<strong>Basic </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Mac OS Apps</strong> <br>
 The Mac OS (operating system) comes with 
bundled software, like Windows does, to help users manage creative files.&nbsp; 
These are sometimes referred to as applets because they&rsquo;re simple 
applications when compared to their commercial counterparts.&nbsp; (An example 
would be comparing Microsoft&rsquo;s Paint with Adobe&rsquo;s 
Illustrator.)&nbsp; If one will only be using the bundled applications, 
there&rsquo;s no doubt those provided with the Mac OS are better.</p> 
<p>For a comparison, I took our vacation slides from this summer and made them 
into a DVD.&nbsp; When I did it on the PC using Windows&rsquo; applets, it took 
me 26-28 hours.&nbsp; It turned out very nice.&nbsp; When I did it on the Mac 
using its applets, it took me 4-5 hours, and the end product was much 
better!&nbsp; Honestly, I was surprised.</p> 
<p>Editing pictures, video, and sound are all similarly better in Mac applets.
</p> 
<p><strong>Full Applications</strong><br>
 Full featured applications for 
these tasks can usually be bought to run on either the Mac or PC.&nbsp; In 
those cases, the software is pretty close to the same in capability, with two 
exceptions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The underlying OS requires some things to be laid out and approached 
differently.&nbsp; Once someone gets used to the different approaches on either 
side, they will prefer doing their work in their familiar OS.</li> 
<li>Some programs, like Microsoft Office, release OS-specific versions where 
each is a year or two after the other, so whichever was released last is often 
better.&nbsp; The PC&rsquo;s current version is 2007, and the Mac&rsquo;s is 
2008.&nbsp; Office 2008 fixes some issues I had with 2007.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Mac Cost</strong><br>
 Macs cost more than Windows PCs.&nbsp; Mac 
users may argue that, but there&rsquo;s really no argument.&nbsp; My high-end 
MacBook Pro cost easily double what I would have spent for a similarly equipped 
PC.&nbsp; It was worth it because supporting Macs is part of our business 
model, but I would otherwise have a hard time justifying the cost difference.
</p> 
<p><strong>Mac Support Issues<br>
</strong>I work in both OSs constantly, and 
I have been disappointed with the Mac OS (Leopard).&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had to 
completely rebuild it from the ground up twice in the last month!&nbsp; 
Honestly, that hasn&rsquo;t happened to me in a Windows OS for many 
years.&nbsp; Both were<br>
 caused by weaknesses in the OS that allowed it to 
corrupt itself:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When I first received this new Mac, it said it needed fourteen 
updates.&nbsp; I told it to install them.&nbsp; Little did I know that doing so 
with three needing restarts would corrupt the OS!&nbsp; Escalated support told 
me that whenever there are updates needing a restart, they should be installed 
separately.&nbsp; I believe the OS should know how to manage that.</li> 
<li>A function I wanted to run between my virtual PC and my Mac didn&rsquo;t 
have some file rights it needed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m used to having full rights to 
the entire drive in Windows, so I told the Mac OS to allow me the same on the 
Mac harddrive.&nbsp; That corrupted the OS again.&nbsp; It should know that 
certain files cannot have their rights changed to protect the integrity of the 
system.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>The Mac Mystique</strong><br>
 Macs have an undeniable mystique 
about them, and it&rsquo;s causing many on our teams to request them.&nbsp; We 
can make them work with PCs on the same network, and even run PC applications 
on them very well.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But few on church and ministry IT staffs can support them, relegating their 
support to the Mac user.&nbsp; The problems are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Those who will use them are likely called to minister, not to support 
computers.&nbsp; Giving them support responsibility means they&rsquo;ll be 
doing so at least some of the time we&rsquo;d rather see them fulfilling their 
call to minister.</li> 
<li>When users are responsible for their own support, they rarely backup their 
files.&nbsp; When something happens (like what happened twice to me!), if their 
files aren&rsquo;t backed up, they will have to spend quite a bit of time 
recreating them.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the Bottom Line?</strong><br>
 Requests for Macs will 
keep coming, and they can work in your environment.&nbsp; They definitely cost 
more, but saying, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; just got harder.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the budget, it&rsquo;s okay to say, 
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Make sure you have a team ready to help with the 
initial setup and ongoing support of your Macs, and you&rsquo;ll be okay.&nbsp;
