<h1>Beat Maker Software - Getting Started in Beat Making</h1> 
<p> </p> 
<h4><strong>DJ Pauly</strong><br>
</h4> <em> </em> 
<p>We all love great sounding hip hop beats. Before if you wanted to make your 
own sounds, you had to have some pretty sophisticated equipment and hardware to 
produce your music. But now, with all the technology &amp; software, there are 
loads of beat maker programs to help you get started.</p> 
<p>DubTurbo was created by an up and coming hip hop artist in residing in 
Toronto, Canada. He was one of the pioneers to develop an affordable and 
entry-level beat maker machine so that even the youngest of aspiring artists 
can start producing their own music. Make no mistake becoming famous in the hip 
hop and rap industry is no easy task. Just because you can act, doesn't mean 
you will be starring in the next summer blockbuster on Hollywood. It's the same 
in the beat making scene, lots of good producers and mixers rarely see the 
light of day because lack of exposure and connections.</p> 
<p>However, first you have to have skill if you really want to make it in this 
industry. This takes time, do not expect once you purchase some software and 
that overnight you will become famous and start selling your tunes. Beat making 
is a skill, and with all skills practice makes perfect. The more hours you put 
on the grind, the better your music will sound.</p> 
<p> As your skills develop, every major artist has their own signature style 
of mixing beats, I highly suggest that you do the same. Develop your own style 
or signature in your music. Once you have incorporated that into your music you 
can begin to set yourself apart and become famous.</p> 
<p>There are lots of beat making programs out there. If you are first starting 
out, it is highly suggested you purchase an entry-level software to jumpstart 
your music. Don't go and spend $500 without ever having any experience in the 
field, who knows you may not like the rap industry after all? We highly suggest 
you check out theDubturbo beat maker, at such a low price there is very little 
you can compare with to other machines ...</p>  0 <br>

<h2>Beastie Boys Inducted Into Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame</h2> 
<p> </p>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Beastie Boys Inducted Into Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame</p> If you&rsquo;re 
not familiar with the Beastie Boys, you&rsquo;ve missed out on one ofrap music
&lsquo;s original acts. The Beastie Boys, who first hit the charts in the 
1980&prime;s, introduced rap music to scores of white, middle-class suburban 
kids. Last week, The Beastie Boys, also known as Adam Horowitz, Adam Yauch, 
Michael Schwartz and Michael Diamond, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame.
<p></p> 
<h3>Honor For Just The Third Rap Act</h3> 
<p>The Beastie Boys are just the third rap group to be inducted into the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame, behind Run-DMC and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 
Five. Rap masters LL Cool J and Chuckie D formally inducted the group.</p> 
<p>In its earliest years, the group was associated closely with producing 
legends Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin at Def Jam Records. The group credited 
other acts in the emerging rap music genre for their influences, including Bad 
Brains, The Slits, the Treacherous Three and XRay Spex. Four of the 
group&rsquo;s eight albums reached the top of the Billboard Album chart, 
including Licensed to Ill, Ill Communication, Hello Nasty and To the 5 
Boroughs. The group continues to perform today, and most recently released an 
album entitled Hot Sauce Committee Part Two in 2011.</p> 
<p>Their first release, New York Thrash, was a forerunner of the modern 
mixtape and preceded the release of their first EP, Polly Wog Stew (1982). 
Originally, the band worked in the hardcore metal genre, but successfully made 
the switch to rap early on. Since the group&rsquo;s inception, they&rsquo;ve 
sold more than 40 million albums world wide, about half of which were sold in 
the United States.</p> 
<p>The Beastie Boys made it big with the help of an established music 
producer, but they also helped to open the door for artists who want to produce 
their own music. The Beastie Boys were considered a 
&ldquo;groundbreaking&rdquo; act in the 1980&prime;s and served as many 
fans&rsquo; first introduction to the rap music genre. The group paired 
famously with Run-DMC for its Raising Hell tour in 1985 and first cracked the R 
&amp; B and Dance charts in the same year with &ldquo;Hold It Now, Hit 
It.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The Beastie Boys demonstrate that anyone can break into rap music and 
deliver a successful sound. For aspiring new musicians in the rap music genre, 
one of the best tools to have is DubTurbo, a complete music-production software 
package that lets you create your own musical style!</p>

<h2>Does Rap Music Promote The Gangsta Lifestyle?</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<h4><strong>DJ Pauly</strong><br>
</h4> <em>Friday, April 6th 2012</em> <br>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Does Rap Music Promote The Gangsta Lifestyle?</p> Rap music can be a highly 
influential form of music, but are some music producers taking advantage of 
certain areas&rsquo; crime rankings to promote their music? That&rsquo;s what 
some analysts are suggesting. Is crime an effective way to sell rap beats? No 
one can say for certain, but certain music producers don&rsquo;t mind the 
association.
<p></p> 
<h3>Do Crime And Rap Have A Solid Association?</h3> 
<p>While many rappers write lyrics about their criminal exploits, and more 
than one rapper&rsquo;s career has ended in a hail of gunfire, music producers 
are quick to point out that music, by itself, doesn&rsquo;t promote crime. That 
doesn&rsquo;t stop rappers like Fresco Clean and Black Lung from using 
Rockford&rsquo;s position as #9 on the FBI&rsquo;s list of the Most Dangerous 
Cities in the US as a way to market the group&rsquo;s music and elevate its 
profile among the gangsta crowd.</p> 
<p>The group&rsquo;s first EP, Whiteboy Wasted, has recently been released by 
producer Soleternity, and hopes to appeal to a largely white middle- and lower 
class youth audience. They&rsquo;re also hoping to catch the attention of 
college-aged students who are part of the fraternity/sorority scene and other 
middle class demographics who are looking for a voice. The songs on Whiteboy 
Wasted are largely about partying and having fun, and could be a nice way to 
kick off the summer.</p> 
<p>The EP is Fresco Clean&rsquo;s recording debut, but the 22-year-old is a 
veteran battle rapper and has traveled the world in rap competitions. Black 
Lung has already released a number of indie beats, and has already released an 
LP under his own name.</p> 
<p>The potential rap and hip-hop audiences are large, and there&rsquo;s plenty 
of room in this growing medium for many more talented musicians. Getting 
started has never been easier. All the tools you need to self-produce your rap 
beats are available in a single, awesome package. Dubturbo combines the best 
tools with the easiest-to-use interface in a single software package. DubTurbo 
is available for either the Mac or PC and enables you to mix your own beats. 
Better still, DubTurbo comes with a library of royalty-free beats you can use 
to enhance your own sounds.</p> 
<p>Need more? How about a library of tutorial videos to help you learn how to 
make the most of this outstanding music software package? DubTurbo is a great 
way to get started in the rap music industry and gives you everything you need 
to record and mix a professional sound.<br>

<h2>Group Demonstrates Hip Hop&rsquo;s International Flair</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<h4><strong>DJ Pauly</strong><br>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Group Demonstrates Hip Hop's International Flair</p> If you&rsquo;ve never 
heard of Bliss n Eso, you&rsquo;re probably not alone, but it might surprise 
you to find out that Bliss and Eso are Australia&rsquo;s premierehip hop music 
artists, and have a professional music career that spans more than a decade. 
Bliss n Eso is actually a trio of musicians. MC Bliss, also known as Jonathan 
Notley, is an American. MC Eso, an Australian, is also known as Max MacKinnon, 
and DJ Izm, a Moroccan, known as Tarik Ejjamai, rounds out the group.
<p></p> 
<h3>Trio Takes To North America</h3> 
<p>The group met in high school and has performed together since that time. 
They occupy Australia&rsquo;s top spot in terms of hip-hop artists, in a field 
that&rsquo;s becoming more crowded every day. The group focuses on its lyrics 
and beats but has tried to avoid developing a predictable style.</p> 
<p>They regularly perform live and still include traditional rap techniques 
like scratching and beatboxing to achieve their unique sound. While 
they&rsquo;ve moved around from label to label, the group has also opened for 
some of rap&rsquo;s most recognizable acts, including 50 Cent, G-Unit, and Lil 
Jon. Bliss and Eso have been nominated for ARIA awards, Australia&rsquo;s 
version of the Grammys.</p> 
<p>Bliss n Eso aren&rsquo;t your typical hip-hop musical act, and have been 
very active in a number of charitable causes. The group&rsquo;s work has helped 
fund relief work in South Africa as well as in Victoria, Australia. 
They&rsquo;ve toured the US several times and have released four albums, one of 
which was certified gold and the group&rsquo;s most recent release, Running on 
Air, was certified platinum.</p> 
<p>If any of this surprises you, it shouldn&rsquo;t. Hip-hop, as a musical 
artform, has demonstrated itself to be among the most culturally flexible, and 
has inspired musicians and artists from all over the world. New musicians find 
the genre to be welcoming, and relatively easy to break into, compared to other 
musical genres like rock.</p> 
<p>Hip-hop, when combined with the ability to self-produce, self-publicize and 
self-distribute music, turns out to be highly appealing to listeners all over 
the world. There&rsquo;s no easier way to start in the music business today 
than by producing your own hip-hop and rap beats.</p> 
<p>Unlike other genres, it&rsquo;s both acceptable and expected that artists 
who are just trying to break into the music scene will create and distribute 
free mixtapes of their music. If you&rsquo;re an aspiring artist and are 
considering going this route, check out some of the best tools available on the 
market today, like dubTurbo and Sonic Producer. Download your copy of one or 
both of these applications, and you&rsquo;ll be making your own unique sounds 
in no time!</p>
