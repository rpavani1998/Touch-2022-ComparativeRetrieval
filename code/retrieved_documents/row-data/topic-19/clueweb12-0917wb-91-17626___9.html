<p>Hello Russ Looney,</p> 
<p>I have heard you mention that Civ 5 will not be supporting mods. I am 
interested in learning the reason to this, and was wondering if you had a more 
through explanation as to why this might be? Confused and lost, I decided to 
look into the matter myself. After a brief investigation of the resource files, 
I determined that they were, indeed, the same as the PC equivalents. I was able 
to, with no trouble, access the files and manually apply a number of mods 
towards my single player experience, as with the PC version prior to release of 
the mod tools.</p> 
<p>I have not extensively worked with mods, as I was waiting for both the Mac 
product and multiplayer mods to become available, but, as I understand it, the 
game reads a plethora of data from an SQLite database, and simply modifies this 
database according to the specifications of the XML files included with the mod 
in question. Lua files, similarly, are simply run en lieu of the original files 
present in the asset folders.</p> 
<p>I, quite honestly, do not understand what sort of issues there could be 
with utilizing the existing mod engine, or simply creating another one. To 
create an XML parser that reads pre-structured files and applies them to a 
database is less than a hundred lines of code, and to swap the source lua file 
for an execution of the code should be a mere handful of lines. I have worked 
with XML parsers and modular reloading python programs, and can not see why 
those methods would not be effective here, solely on the Mac OS X platform.</p> 
<p>I feel reasonably confident at this point that I could whip up a quick 
script myself to apply any mod downloaded manually, backup the original assets, 
and replace them with an external app to effectively use mods in single player. 
As for the tools themselves, the tools provided by Firaxis are, quite frankly, 
the pits, and you&rsquo;re pretty much no better off using a text editor en 
lieu of modbuddy (it&rsquo;s only a matter of knowledge and documentation, the 
workflow hardly seems improved). I think most Civ fans agree that ditching the 
mod engine for lack of tools denies the creations created by our Windows using 
counterparts, and the ingenuity of Mac modders to run VirtualBox, parallels, or 
bootcamp. Even worldbuilder, firetuner, and Nexus could be re-implemented, and 
indeed, much improved upon from their .NET counterparts. Some enterprising 
players have already begun doing so, in fact, and at least three tools 
replacing facets of these programs exist, and with significant improvement over 
the original functionality (for the Windows platform, of course).</p> 
<p>Long rant aside, I was wondering what the actual specific reasons were for 
removing the mod interface and functionality from the Mac version, be they 
technical or fiscal. I would of course be interested myself in remedying this 
lack, and would be available to work with core developers by providing 
front-end interfaces for any external tools should they be deemed necessary (I 
am, of course, assuming that all core resources will be kept internal). I 
prefer to use the Qt libraries with the PyQt package, but of course am flexible 
if external demands prevent high level cross-platform solutions.</p> 
<p>You may contact me through the personal e-mail attached to this comment, if 
need be.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your reply,<br>

<p>A brief follow up post from a little while later.</p> 
<p>It seems the Mac Civ V suffers from the exact same performance issues and 
graphical glitches that the PC version running in a cider shell does. It evens 
sports the (DX9) text in the title bar in windowed mode. I don&rsquo;t think I 
need to draw any explicit conclusions from this, right?</p> 
<p>Also, I needn&rsquo;t have gone to all that trouble above. Simply modifying 
the Mainmenu.xml in assets to display the Mods menu as in the PC program was 
enough to restore the menu. The mod browser failed to connect, but PC mods 
dropped into the mods folder in ~/Documents appeared and were fully functional 
(or, at least the three I tested were). I highly suspect the majority will be 
functional.</p> 
<p>To prospective buyers of Civ V, save yourself a download, install Steam in 
a Cider shell and grab the PC version. Or run in bootcamp for better 
performance yet. All features and full game supported.</p> </li>

<p>Mr. Tempus, I think it is safe to say you know your stuff. We&rsquo;ll be 
posting more information on the subject matter of mods soon, but in a nutshell, 
mods are not officially supported at the moment. I know that&rsquo;s a crappy 
answer, but I want to make sure I have all the information necessary before 
posting much more.</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.aspyr.com Michael <br>

<p>@tempus &hellip; Lua mods will work. These are the only mods that are 
available for PC or Mac right now. We&rsquo;ll have more information on this 
soon. And, we&rsquo;ll continue to work on making the game great on the Mac.</p>
<p>The emulator stuff doesn&rsquo;t help anyone on a Mac today. Our game is a 
native port that runs great in the supported systems &ndash; we fully support 
the game, will be posting Mac specific updates, and are of course working the 
latest Mac OS versions as well.</p> 
<p>We are doing our best to support people who want great Mac software.</p> 
<p>Thanks to everyone commenting, and supporting Mac software.</p> </li> </ul>

<p>Hi. I have purchased the game, but can&rsquo;t find the download link at 
all. When I go to order history at gameagent.com, there is nothing there!</p> 
<p>Please help.</p> </li> 
<li> ltcommander.data <br>

<p>Supported Video Cards:<br>
 NVIDIA GeForce&reg; 8600, 8800, 9600M, GT 120, 
320M<br>
 ATI Radeon HD 2600, HD 3870, HD 4670, HD 4850, HD 5670, HD 5750</p> 
<p>I noticed your supported video card list is missing several GPUs that is 
hard to see why they wouldn&rsquo;t be supported. Namely the GT130 which is 
similar to the 8800GS which is supported, the 330M GT, which should be a pretty 
popular GPU, the GTX285, the HD4870, the HD5770, and most notably the HD5870, 
the current fastest Mac GPU. It&rsquo;s probably borderline, but is the popular 
9400M supported? The HD2400XT presumably is a no.</p> </li>

<p>Will Civilization 5 Mac be available soin in Canada??</p> </li> 
<li> Chris <br>

<p>Thanks for the Cyber Monday promotion!  I bought the digital download which 
was a tad under 3GB. Why then when I activate on Steam like the Readme says am 
I downloading the entire thing again? Your installer didn&rsquo;t do anything 
but open Steam, so why package 3GB of data it isn&rsquo;t using?</p> </li> 
<li> ckd <br>

<p>Chris: it could be worse; I have the physical media, and Steam still starts 
downloading several GB of data when I run the installer! What was the point of 
the boxed game again? (Hint: in my case, the point was to not tie up my DSL 
forever downloading it.)</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.aspyr.com Michael <br>

<p>@ckd, Chris, Guess what? It&rsquo;s not supposed to work that way. The 
download from gameagent.com and/or the physical media does negate the need for 
a Steam download. Launching the installer *does* copy the assets to where Steam 
expects them, and that takes some time, but it&rsquo;s not supposed to 
re-download the game assets.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re having problems, PLEASE contact our support team at 
support@aspyr.com. They are here to help!</p> 
<p>Thank you for supporting us!!!</p> </li>

<p>@Tempus: is Civ5 Cider based? I also recognise the use of DX9 in the config 
xml file. I felt very disappointed after purchasing this game, I thought I 
don&rsquo;t have to install Bootcamp to get it run smoothly but now yeah.. I 
guess i have no other choice.</p> 
<p>VERDICT: Please DO NOT buy Mac version from Steam or Retail Version. It IS 
waste of money! Instead buy PC version and run it in Bootcamp.</p> 
<p>To Aspyr, great job, you&rsquo;ve just done another &ldquo;great&rdquo; 
&ldquo;port&rdquo; (did I just say &ldquo;port&rdquo;??)</p> </li> </ul> <br>
