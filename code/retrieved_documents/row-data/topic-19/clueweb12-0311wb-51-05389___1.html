<h1>Is web development better on a Mac or a PC?</h1> 
<p>Two months ago, I bought an imac. The reasons for doing this were 
plentiful, and overall I&rsquo;m happy with my experience so far, but I wanted 
to talk about why I switched, what&rsquo;s better and what I miss about a PC. 
Hopefully this will be useful to anyone thinking about switching in the near 
future.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>My history with apple</h3> 
<p> The first computer we ever had at home (when I was about 10) was an Apple 
mac and I though it was awful. Why? because you couldn&rsquo;t get any games 
for it &ndash; while my friends were able to buy new PC games in the shop 
&ndash; I was stuck playing the default games. Ever since, then I&rsquo;ve 
owned PCs.</p> 
<p>At my first proper job since leaving uni, everyone in the department used a 
mac but I still wasn&rsquo;t 100% sold on them. I kept getting told by all the 
other mac fanatics that I&rsquo;d soon change my mind. They seemed very similar 
to PCs except with a few distinct disadvantages:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Office documents created on a mac often looked funny on a PC</li> 
<li>Virtual PC was pretty awful and it was very difficult to test websites in 
Internet Explorer on Windows</li> 
<li>The # key was missing &ndash; it took me ages to find out it was alt+3 *
</li> </ul> 
<p>* In Virtual PC, the # didn&rsquo;t work at all so I had to copy and paste
</p> 
<p>One exception was, as opposed to Windows Ctrl+Alt+Delete technique which 
allows you to close troublesome programs, Apple&rsquo;s &lsquo;Force 
Quit&rsquo; (Apple+Option+Esc) performed its duty marvelously.</p> 
<h3>The Turnaround</h3> 
<p>So what caused my turnaround in opinion? One word; Vista. I installed Vista 
as soon as it was released (because my PC had a virus, which I had a feeling 
Vista would cure &ndash; and it did). I immediately hated it. It gave my PC a 
low Vista compatibility rating which meant it never ran the sexy Aero 
interface. It also crashed a lot more, gave me grey screens that asked me to 
press OK a lot and often froze for minutes at a time with the screen literally 
frosted over with a light blue tint.</p> 
<p>I started to think about macs &ndash; a lot of the bloggers, that I read 
and respect, seemed to be using them and getting good results. I&rsquo;d also 
heard about Bootcamp/Parallels and knew running Windows on a mac and, 
therefore, testing on Internet Explorer would be easier than the other way 
around, but I was put off by the price.</p> 
<p>After months of deliberation, and waiting for the new OS X to come out I 
finally bought a mac. I felt I could no longer be without one for the browser 
testing factor.</p> 
<h3>2 months later</h3> 
<p>After 2 months I am still happy with my purchase and these things please me:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>how the mac looks: the computer is beautiful and can site in any room and 
actually be a feature</li> 
<li>how few wires are needed. I know have 3 plugs: 1 for the mac, 1 for the 
printer and 1 for the router</li> 
<li>stacks</li> 
<li>it isn&rsquo;t vista</li> </ul> 
<p>and these things don&rsquo;t:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the mice are rubbish (even the mighty mouse) it randomly stops scrolling 
and gets very dirty very quickly</li> 
<li>Parallels is good but its only seems like a (much) more reliable version 
of Virtual PC and not the ground breaking amazing piece of kit promised by the 
blogosphere</li> 
<li>Finder isn&rsquo;t great: I think Windows&rsquo; Explorer edges that one: 
I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;get&rsquo; the usefulness of cover-flow</li> </ul> 
<h3>Summary</h3> 
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve now got a mac, I don&rsquo;t the miss the PC. I 
certainly don&rsquo;t miss Vista, in particular, my computer now freezes less, 
CDs are recognised and iTunes works again meaning I can use a computer properly 
again in my post-Vista world.</p> 
<p>To answer my original question which I just realised I hadn&rsquo;t, so far 
web development isn&rsquo;t any easier on a mac. Maybe Ruby on Rails 
development is but I use PHP. Windows has the excellentxampp so setting up a 
local web server is easy &ndash; it also hasgreat FTP programs like Filezilla, 
awesome CSS writing programs likeTopStyle but you can&rsquo;t use it to test 
CSS in Safari/Camino and thats where a mac edges it for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently switched to using a Mac at home too (after my PC 
died at Christmas), although I&rsquo;ve had a Mac at work for the last couple 
of years.</p> 
<p>Aside from the complete lack of games (don&rsquo;t care any more, 
that&rsquo;s what the Wii is for), I find it much better for just about 
everything. To address your specific complaints:</p> 
<p>- don&rsquo;t bother with Finder, get Quicksilver for super-fast keyboard 
shortcuts to everything you need<br>
 - MAMP (www.mamp.info) is the Mac 
equivalent of XAMPP, and is actually much easier to set up, and has a built in 
port and PHP version switcher in the GUI<br>
 - Aptana has a pretty decent FTP 
manager built-in, plus it has site synchronisation as well<br>
 - If you like 
TopStyle, wait until you try CSSEdit; it is hands-down the best CSS editor 
I&rsquo;ve ever used (and is also included in the MacHeist bundle at the 
moment, which I highly recommend getting)</p> 
<p>As for Parallels &ndash; have you got the most up-to-date version of both 
it and Windows? I&rsquo;m using XP SP2, and it&rsquo;s super zippy, very 
usable, and perfect for browser testing.</p> 
<p>I agree about the mice, although you get used to it after a while. Another 
thing to add is that having a Mac means you can sync your Address Book and iCal 
with your iPhone. :)</p> Reply <br>

<p>Thanks for your comment Matthew:</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using a combo of MAMP Pro, Transmit, DreamWeaver to get 
things done and it&rsquo;s working out very nicely.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded Quicksilver but haven&rsquo;t really worked out what 
the its actually for :(</p> 
<p>I think I have to update Parallels from 3.0 to 3 point whatever. Parallels 
worksmuch nicer with XP than it does with Vista &ndash; I think that&rsquo;s 
Vista problem rather than Parellels.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bother with parallels. Its crap, and worse the suppport is non 
existent. Try VMware fusion.</p> Reply <br>
