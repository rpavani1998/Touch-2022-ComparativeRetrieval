<p>Filed Under: Apple, Featured, Malware, Vulnerability</p> 
<p> Last week, there was a lot focus on the security of Apple Macs after the 
Russian security firm, Dr Web, revealed that they had found a botnet comprising 
overhalf a million infected Mac computers.</p> 
<p>Macs were becoming infected with Flashback malware after users were 
redirected to a rogue website from a compromised site. JavaScript code was used 
to load a Java-applet which exploited a vulnerability (since patched). </p> 
<p>The thing that surprised many of us was the scale of the botnet.</p> 
<p>Mikko Hypponen, Chief Research Officer at F-Secure, put it very well when 
he said that, proportionally, the Flashback Trojan was as widespread amongst 
Macs as the notorious Conficker worm had been amongst Windows-based PCs.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;Flashback would now have infected 1% of Macs, making Flashback 
roughly as common for Mac as Conficker was for Windows&quot; 
macworld.com/article/116625&hellip;</p>&mdash; <br>
Mikko Hypponen (@mikko) 
April 06, 2012 </blockquote> 
<p>The attack has left a lingering question: how secure are Apple Macs? </p> 
<p>Apple has traditionally marketed its systems as being more secure than 
those running Microsoft Windows, but how true is that?</p> 
<p>Mac OS, the Apple Mac operating system, is based upon the Berkley Software 
Distribution (BSD) of Unix, surrounded by a nice graphical user interface.</p> 
<p>If you began your career using Unix, as I did, one of the things you come 
to value is that Unix (and hence Mac OS) has always had a security model built 
into the operating system.</p> 
<p>That was not always the case for Windows as it was originally based upon 
MS-DOS. The concept of Read, Write and Execute for various executables and 
data, as implemented in Unix, is simple to understand and has stood Unix 
systems in good stead for many years.</p> 
<p>Unix has other simple features, such as storing executable code and data in 
separate folders. When you install a program in Unix, you typically predict 
which folders the executables and data will reside. The corollary of this is 
that it is easy to completely remove an installation.</p> 
<p>Anyone who has installed software onto a Windows platform knows that the 
installed components can be placed in a wide variety of folders, the obscurity 
of which mean that if you were ever to attempt to unpick the installation 
manually you&rsquo;d inevitably end up with some unwanted pieces of code on 
your machine.</p> 
<p>For Windows, this has spawned a whole host of tools for the uninstall and 
clean-up process.</p> 
<p> So, Mac OS &ldquo;feels&rdquo; like it should be more secure. But is it in 
fact just tidier?</p> 
<p>Fundamentally, there is no reason why Macs should not be targeted using 
malware in the same way that viruses, Trojans and worms are built to target 
Windows systems.</p> 
<p>You might run, for example, a piece of JavaScript that steals credentials, 
or a keylogger, without necessarily attacking the operating system. Likewise, 
you might exploit a vulnerability in a third party application, as happened 
recently when abackdoor Trojan embedded inside boobytrapped Word documents 
successfully ran on Macs.</p> 
<p>Ten years ago, when Windows gained a bad reputation for security, Microsoft 
responded by introducing itsTrustworthy Computing Initiative. A security model 
had previously existed but it wasn't until XP, where objects were givenSecurity 
IDs and allowed actions were enabled in a way similar to Unix, that a model 
existed that had the same value as that in Unix. However, Microsoft took a long 
look at the threat and made a conscious effort to evolve their operating 
systems to counter it.</p> 
<p>Initially, one of the biggest threats was considered by Microsoft to be 
buffer overflow. This is where regions of computer memory that should not be 
used for executing code are misused by rogue software.</p> 
<p> As well as preventing developers inadvertently building this into their 
applications by adding safeguards to the compilers, Microsoft also introduced 
memory protection mechanisms within their operating systems.</p> 
<p>For example, since Vista was introduced in 2007, Windows has had address 
space layout randomisation (ASLR) which is implemented so as to obscure most of 
what an attacker needs to conduct, for example, shell code injection attacks.
</p> 
<p>Mac OS acquired ASLR in late 2007 (Mac OS X v10.5, aka 
&quot;Leopard&quot;). Unfortunately, Apple&rsquo;s implementation is not as 
advanced as that in Windows, and hence it does not provide the same degree of 
protection.</p> 
<p>Apple said it planned to improve items such as ASLR in its next release of 
Mac OS, but some five years later we are still waiting.</p> 
<p> I think what all of this exemplifies is two populations of users (Mac OS 
and Windows) that have developed very different attitudes to security.</p> 
<p>Those using Windows have been aware for a long time that their systems have 
vulnerabilities, and so they are much more likely to use some form of 
protection such as anti-virus software. Windows users also typically update 
their software when an update is released by Microsoft; they know updates mean 
that vulnerabilities may have been found, and it is safer to update than be 
exposed.</p> 
<p>Those using Mac OS have, perhaps, been lulled into a false sense of 
security. Mac OS users think their systems are somehow inherently 
&ldquo;secure&rdquo; and hence they are less likely to update as frequently as 
Windows users, or to use tools such as anti-virus software.</p> 
<p>A Mac OS user is less likely to be attacked than a Windows user, but that 
is nothing to do with the level of vulnerability in the operating system. It 
has everything to do with the fact that over 80% of the personal computers in 
use run the Microsoft Windows operating system.</p> 
<p>Those building malware would rather attack the vast majority of the users. 
They get a bigger bang for their buck, to borrow a phrase from the military.</p>
<p>What is now catching up with Mac OS users is that their platform of choice 
is now becoming popular enough to be considered worthy of hackers&rsquo; 
efforts. With thelast three years seeing a growth in Mac OS malware in excess 
of 200%, Mac OS users need to start adopting a different mindset or they will 
be caught out.</p> 
<p>Mac OS users may be &quot;safer&quot; than Windows users, simply because 
they have fewer attacks focussed on their systems, but they are not more 
&quot;secure&quot;.</p> 
<p>Apple has its part to play by releasing updates rapidly in response to 
known vulnerabilities, and users need to make sure they implement those updates 
as well asinstalling security software to protect against the coming threat.</p>
<p>Now is the time to prepare, rather than try to react, when the inevitable 
onslaught begins.</p> Follow @ProfWoodward

<p>Macs safer, no. Having said that in the last 20 years of using a Mac I have 
been infected 0 times had 0 malware installed and feel safe. When running a 
competing product, it never found anything on my system. There were numerous 
reasons that it exposed me to potentially more vulnerabilities than it could 
have ever found. By default am antivirus system must download and install 
updates. It will generally do that silently to avoid constantly nagging the 
user. These unknown downloads would also need to be able to scan and change the 
lowest levels of the system or it isn't protecting all areas. At that point you 
are trusting the security measures of the vendor to protect your system from 
infection through their software. Thanks to a competitor not even letting the 
world know their source code was stolen 5 years prior to an announcement, I 
can't trust a security company either by default. Anti virus software is a 
personal choice and not always needed. The performance hit from most as well as 
the way they prevent real work from occurring at times leads me to believe I 
can rebuild my system once every 2 years with less disruption than installing 
AV software.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Never, ever use your own example of being virus-less for X years as a proof 
your system is secure.</p> 
<p>I have run windows 95 without anti virus for more than 10 years without 
virus of any kind. It was evidently only because I was prudent, as when my 
father get the same computer, the system became infected beyond repair in less 
than ten minutes.</p> Reply <br>

<p>So what I am getting out of this is the best combination is your computer 
being a Mac and your user being intelligent and diligent about putting 
antivirus and updates on their machine. That gives you an OS that is targeted 
less frequently and a user that knows they are not invincible and updates their 
machine and AV software regularly.</p> 
<p>I have nothing against Windows PCs as I have to use them every day, it's 
because of that I know how unrelenting the updates and patches are :-).</p>

 A Mac isn&rsquo;t susceptible

<p>Wow, Sophos continues its &quot;scare the mac users into buying unecessary 
security software &quot; campaign. Of course there is no such thing as a 
totally secure system, but the clunky design of windows &amp; the whole 
retarded user experience forced by using windows, means that users are more 
likely to be trapped into downloading and running malware. So far Apple have 
done a good job patching vulnerabilities &amp; it is not necessary for mac 
users to degrade their user experience by running intrusive and performance 
degrading security products. I loved the bit about &quot;backdoor Trojan 
embedded inside boobytrapped Word documents &quot;! ffs most mac users long ago 
learned that the safest thing for their machines was a NO Micros**t policy, it 
removed risk &amp; stopped the performance degradation &amp; instability 
inherant to poorly designed and developed software from Microsoft, who often 
seemed more intent on changing the macOS to suit themselves rather than 
designing software for the mac (anyone remember the number of system extensions 
(&amp; vulnerabilities) that installing word on OS7 needed?). Whatever the new 
security conscious approach from Micros**t entails, the company will always be 
associated with poorly designed, buggy and insecure software, and this 
reputation is well deserved. If you want a smooth secure user experience there 
is one golden rule, do not buy any micros**t products</p> Reply <br>

<p>&quot;So far Apple have done a good job patching vulnerabilities&quot; - 
Apple were, what, 6 weeks later with the current Java patches for OS X than the 
patches for all other operating systems. This most recent Mac Flashplayer virus 
was therefore still technically a zero day attack (no patch available) on Macs, 
42 days after the vulnerability was patched on &quot;buggy and insecure&quot; 
Windows.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Part of the problem is that the Mac OSX version of Java is not supported 
directly by Sun/Oracle. Apple has to wait for Sun/Oracle to release information 
regarding patches and updates to Java before they can fix it in their 
implementation. Thus, Apple's JVM is usually behind any other platform in 
regards to fixes and/or versions. Apple originally did their own JVM when Sun 
basically told them it was not worth their effort to support the platform. 
Perhaps the two parties should get together and remedy this situation.</p> Reply

<p>It is of course peoples perrogative to stick their head in the sand and 
ignore the warnings from Sophos who, you could legitimately argue have a 
potential vested interest in scaring MAC users (although their MAC AV product 
is presently free for home use!). However, there are similar warnings coming 
from many other independent sources and many incidents being reported to 
support the proliferation of MAC attacks. It is my understanding that MACs are 
definitely now becoming a focus of attention for the authors of malware exactly 
because they know that they are surrounded by this invulnerability culture and 
often left unprotected and so they can use them as carriers to inject malware 
into networks and other systems. By being in denial, I feel you potentially put 
others as well as yourself at risk. I will not dispute the merits of MACs over 
PCs especially in the area of security but neither they nor Apple are perfect 
and I strongly recommend all MAC users to start taking this issue seriously.</p>

<p>Have to agree with City-Support - although he omits to say whether the 
infected files had windows viruses in them which would not affect his client's 
Mac!<br>
 Have used Sophos for about 15 years on a mixed Mac and PC network (we 
are a Printer) and have not had an issue.<br>
 Even Mr Cluley's occasional 
barbed stabs at Macs have only been mildly irritating when it is obvious that 
not running a &quot;decent AV system&quot; in a business environment is just 
plain stupid.<br>
 Like G Dean, the &quot;charms&quot; of MicroSoft elude me, 
but as long as the machines are protected and the only worry is the convoluted 
logic behind the operating system - I can live with them - albeit with having 
to pay for &quot;professional&quot; help which is not needed on the Macs.<br>
 
Lets face it - ALL computer users need to stop being complacent and realise 
that AV is essential.</p> Reply <br>

<p>There's no such thing as a 100% secure OS. Mac OSX is just as vulnuerable, 
and this latest Trojan proves that. On my MacBook I have auto log on disabled, 
and I have the firewall enabled and stealth mode on. I also have Sophos 
Anti-Virus installed on my Mac for protection. I've also disabled Java applets 
in Safari, as well as having the latest version of Java. I do checks for 
updates at least once a week, and I keep Sophos Anti-Virus updated. Patching 
any vulnerabilities will ensure that such drive-by attacks will be nullified. 
However, keep in mind that nothing is perfect, so be very careful of which 
websites you go to.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Alan, can you please answer this for me? </p> 
<p>I have a desktop PPC G5 iMac with OS 10.4.11, Tiger. Does Apple's adoption 
of an inferior ASLR with effect from 10.5 Leopard mean I would be safer to 
remain in Tiger rather than to upgrade to Leopard? Or is the ASLR that comes 
with Leopard better than no ASLR at all? (PPC G5s cannot accept any OS later 
than Leopard.)</p>

replace the desktop Mac any time soon.</p>

<p>IMO, mac owners should be very concerned. The 'malware industry' has become 
very organized over the last few years and most malware is built using 
standardized exploit tool kits that are purchased on the black market. The 
large criminal enterprises that create and market these tool kits have now 
added 'mac support' to their standard product offerings.</p> 
<p>As these criminal enterprises have grown, so have their R&amp;D budgets. 
With this increase in scale, it's natural for them to expand their market to 
cover macs in addition to PCs.</p> 
<p>My guess is that we'll see an explosion of mac infections as miscreants 
around the world upgrade their malware to use these latest exploit kits, 
seeking the newest technology and cool new features.</p> Reply <br>

<p>There appear to be some factual errors or at least misleading statements in 
this article.</p> 
<p>&quot;That was not always the case for Windows as it was originally based 
upon MS-DOS.&quot; What you don't say is that there are two Windows families, 
MS-DOS, W95, W98 etc. and the Windows NT family. NT was wriiten from the ground 
up by Dave Cutler who was hired away from Digital. Culter previously developed 
VMS and NT drew heavily on that earlier experience.</p> 
<p>&quot;A security model had previously existed but it wasn't until XP, where 
objects were given Security IDs and allowed actions were enabled in a way 
similar to Unix, that a model existed that had the same value as that in 
Unix.&quot;</p> 
<p>SIDs have existed in the Windws NT family of operating systems from the 
beginning. The first version was releaseed in mid-1993. That's almost 20 years 
ago and more than 8 years before the release of Windows XP.</p> 
<p>The major security issue associated with Windows relates to software 
development and users:</p> 
<p>1. Even though NT implemented a security model similar to VMS and UNIX (NT 
actually had a POSIX subsystem and currently supports an INTERIX subsystem) 
from the start getting third-party developers and end-users to use it was 
difficult. When the large MS-DOS/W95/W98 user-base switched to Windows XP they 
were all used to running with full administrative rights because that was the 
way things worked on the older windows family and most software required such 
rights. So they Windows XP inherited users, software and developers that 
assumed admin rights (i.e. the computing world's equivalent of crack addicts). 
Recent versions of Windows have been attempts to force third-party developers 
to write code that will run in standard user rights and wean windows users of 
their admin rights addiction. However, the LUA rights model has existed in NT 
from the start. Take a look at Cripin Cowan's PDC talk from 2008 &quot;Windows 
7: Best Practices for Developing for Windows Standard User&quot;
http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/bursteg/archiv...<br>
 2. Microsoft also 
implemented the Security Development Lifecycle program to train developers 
(their own and third-party) to bake security into the software development 
process from the very start. Seehttp://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/. This 
was one of the main innovations to come out the trusworthy computing 
initiative. Other companies have since adopted this development model but a lot 
of the software still isn't deevloped with any consideration to security. Think 
most people developing apps for iOS and Android give a second thought about 
security? Think again. Same goes for web developers. If web developers gave a 
damn about security something as simple to prevent as SQL injection wouldn't be 
so common.</p> 
<p>&quot;Apple said it planned to improve items such as ASLR in its next 
release of Mac OS, but some five years later we are still waiting.&quot;</p> 
<p>My understanding is that Apple was slow to implement ASLR but that the 
current version of OS X has caught up. Again there is quite a bit of 
application software that isn't written to utilize ASLR. Microsoft does provide 
a tool to manually force such apps to use it (along with other types of memory 
protection).</p> Reply <br>

I was trying to make sure I didn't compare apples and oranges :). Always tricky 
in 1000 words. As to ASLR I had understood that it was not going to be fully

<p>Yes, I understand the space limitations and that NT wasn't widely used on 
the desktop before XP, although NT3.51, NT4 and W2K were vastly superior to any 
other desktop operating systems available contemporaneously (and Microsoft 
often gave NT away for free).</p>

<p>Windows XP for the desktop came out in 2001. OS X for the desktop came out 
in 2001. Your article compares Windows and OS X. Which Windows do you think we 
thought you meant?</p> 
<p>When you wrote &quot;Mac OS is based on BSD&quot;, you meant &quot;From 
2001, Mac OS has been the OS X flavour, based on BSD.&quot; You should 
therefore have written, &quot;Windows is based on VMS,&quot; meaning, 
&quot;From 2001, desktop Windows has been the Windows NT flavour, based on 
VMS.&quot;</p> 
<p>That wouldn't have added any words to the article - plus you could then 
have left out two whole paragraphs about Windows not having file permissions, 
and UNIX having them built-in.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Guess it's time for me to try Sophos again on my Macs. The first time 
around it reported a lot of irrelevant garbage. Maybe the time has now come?<br>
 I fight Windows malware nearly every day as part of my job so I am way more 
familiar with the stuff than I care to be. One of the reasons why I only have 
Macs running at home - too fatiguing to deal with malware 24/7.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I've run Sophos on my macs since 1999, and it has never reported any 
irrelevant garbage: just a handful of infected emails in all that time.</p>

<p>I think most of the stuff it found came via a work Exchange account I was 
monitoring at home. Up until now, virus/malware concerns in my Mac environment 
have been next to none. Nothing close to the infections found in Windows. The 
worst part in my job is dealing with systems people bring in because they 
&quot;work from home&quot; and it's our job to clean up those messes too.</p>

<p>Before I retired I worked for Meteorological Office Defence Services, who 
realised that people did work at home and either emailed or brought it into the 
office. They realised that this was a potential source of infection, so they 
bought a licence for home use by every single member of staff. That is quite a 
safe way for employers to operate.</p> <br>

<p>For clarification, I should have written that they bought a Sophos 
antivirus licence for every member of staff.</p> <br>

<p>@ G Dean</p> 
<p>If you were spouting more than hot air you'd know that Apple is trying to 
develop a program similar to Microsoft's SDL and that Apple has actually hired 
away security expertise from Microsoft and other companies over the last couple 
of years to help address their on-going security problem.</p> 
<p>Steve Jobs came up with some amazing products but security was never big on 
the feature list. Well, security Kool-Aid maybe but you really shouldn't drink 
it.</p> Reply <br>

<p>As someone forced to use micros**t products at work for 20 years &amp; 
having my productivity diminished by the experience I offer no apologies for 
not enthusing about the micros**t experience. Of course I run anti virus 
software on a regular basis just in case. Along with never downloading things 
from web sites, or emails &amp;not using word, this works for me. I remember 
fondly the seamless &amp; non intrusive nature of Disinfectant on OS7 compared 
with the intrusive nature of Norton &amp; sophos products on the PCs I have to 
use it speaks volumes about the scare tactics &amp; marketing of the security 
companies who have managed to create a major industry out of poorly developed 
software by micros**t</p> Reply <br>

<p>I agree with you on Norton. Never used Sophos antivirus so can't comment.

<p>Good read, but you talk about Windows history starting on top of MS DOS and 
security<br>
 Being introduced in XP. Windows on MS DOS died with Windows 98 SE 
(or Me if you choose to acknowledge its existence). XP is the successor of 
Windows 2000 and Windows NT, which definitely had a security model built into 
the operating system, including file system restrictions in NTFS to secure 
read/write/execute permissions. XP was just the version version of his stream 
made to be consumer friendly for home users.</p> Reply <br>

<p>What I notice is security issues are brought about by other companies when 
you add their programs to your system. Perhaps the issue isn't as clear as 
PC/MAC and has to do with other companies having to take responsibility for 
making operating systems vulnerable. Adobe Flash, Java, and a number of other 
add-in and plug-ins make all computers more vulnerable. I see no reason for 
those companies not to bear part of the burden to keep all computers secure by 
cleaning up their code.</p> 
<p>Nearly every time I hear about a new vulnerability it isn't due to the OS 
being vulnerable, it's due to some sloppy coding in some app that was made for 
a PC/MAC. It's time to start laying blame where it really lies. While I know 
perfectly secure system, sometimes I wonder if the guys coding their programs 
even care or notice if they make a system more vulnerable with their apps. I'd 
guess they don't even notice, and probably don't care since they've made their 
buck, and they can pass the responsibility on to the guys who have to patch the 
operating system to block a new exploit created by sloppy coders.</p> Reply <br>

<p>A change of mindset and some extra security will go a long way for the (in 
the most polite way) ignorant apple product user. You're always less likely to 
get hit by cars if you check the road, just like you're less likely to get hit 
by malware if you check your system, no matter what OS you're using.</p> Reply

<p>I have to applaud Sophos for bringing their av to the mac market. I get 
everyone I know to install it, it's free, no longer slow downs your mac or 
interfere with normal operation and is great at helping me not pass on dodgy 
emails to my windows brethren !<br>
 If I now turn off java in my browsers I 
really do feel quite safe.... Even if it's in a false way!</p> Reply <br>
