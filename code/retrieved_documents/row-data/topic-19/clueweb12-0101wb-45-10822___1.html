<h1>Guide: Mac Poker Online</h1> <br>
<br>

<h1>Mac Poker Online</h1> Having a Mac/Macintosh computer makes you feel a bit 
luckier and more safer than your fellow PC users, right? It doesn't crash, you 
don't get viruses and it might even look alot better than most PC's! But when 
it comes to online poker and gambling, the Mac's are a poor choice. Don't 
worry, BankrollMob will guide you in the right direction and teach you how to 
play your favorite game - online poker - on your Mac!<br>
<br>
 You have two 
options, either install Windows on your Mac or use poker clients that work as a 
webclients or a dedicated Mac poker client. Read more below...<br>
<br>

<h2>Play Poker with Mac compatible poker clients</h2> If you don't want to 
install Windows or you simply don't own a valid license, then you can still 
play online poker.<br>
<br>
 Here's a list of pokersites with either a webbased 
poker client or a dedicated Mac poker client. We suggest you check out our 
reviews which also shows the best no deposit / deposit bonuses currently 
available for that site:<br>

<h2>Installing Windows and run all the poker clients</h2> If you want to be 
able to run pretty much every poker client out there, or if your favourite 
poker client only supports Windows, then you have to pick this option. You 
simply need to get your Mac to run Windows XP, Vista or 7. There's a few 
possibilites, here's some:<br>
<br>
<i>You need a valid Windows XP/Vista/7 
license in order to use the options below!</i> <br>
<br>
<b>Boot Camp by Apple
</b> <br>
 Boot Camp is a program developed by Apple and it comes free with all 
Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). Boot Camp allows you to install Windows on your Mac and 
run Windows natively. Whenever you need to do stuff in Windows, simply reboot 
your Mac, hold down the &quot;ALT&quot; key and you will be asked if you want 
to boot &quot;Mac OS X&quot; or &quot;Windows&quot;. Selecting Windows will of 
course boot into Windows and it will be completely like any other PC running 
Windows.<br>
<br>
 The downside is, you need to restart your computer in order 
to change operatingsystem. But, you get the best performance as both 
operatingsystems will run natively.<br>
<br>
 For more information, please 
refer to this article:Boot Camp: Run Windows on your Mac. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Parallels Desktop for Mac by Parallels</b> <br>
 Parallels Desktop for Mac is 
one of the most used virtualization programs for the Mac to run Windows. This 
enables you to run Windows AND Mac OS X at the same time - side by side. You 
simply launch Parallels like it was any other program and it will boot Windows. 
Parallels will also allow you to boot your Boot Camp Windows installation. If 
you decide to use Boot Camp to run Windows so you can run it natively, then 
Parallels will also run the very same Windows installation - so you can run 
Windows and Leopard side by side at the same time when necessary and restart 
your Mac to boot into Windows if you need better performance.<br>
<br>
 
Parallels Desktop for Mac is not free, butcheck it out at their site. <br>
<br>

<br> <b>VMware Fusion 2.0 by VMware</b> <br>
 VMware has been around for a very 
long time and is well known for their virtulization products. It does pretty 
much the same as Parallels, so we suggest you check out both sites and see what 
you prefer.Learn more about VMware Fusion. <br>
