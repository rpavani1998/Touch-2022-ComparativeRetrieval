 Thinkpads are 
simply<i>the most solid</i> laptops money can buy. Undeniably number-one 
support. Also they're a lot more durable than macs. And the included IBM 
software is really very useful (like Active Protection System for your hard

 When I went to 
college I got a Thinkpad, my brother got an iBook. My Thinkpad barely made it 
through 2 years, my brother still uses his iBook (this is now ~6 years later). 
A year ago I relented and bought myself a MacBook Pro, today's Lenovo Thinkpads 
don't even compare. A couple people at my office have the new Thinkpads, but 
far more now have MacBooks or MacBook Pros. It has nothing to do with PC vs. 
Mac, Apple simply makes excellent machines. For the record, my office is a 
Windows XP only shop, so all those Mac owners are running XP on their macs (at 
least at work). Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

 We have at least a 
thousand running Thinkpads and have had several thousand over the last 3 years. 
T41,43,60,61,62 and X30,31 and maybe a few oddballs in there. For those that 
are familiar with IBM and Lenovo, you will notice some of those laptops were 
pure IBM, some hybrids, and some are pure Lenovo. We have seen no difference in 
the quality of these laptops over the years. People can have their own opinions 
based on a neighbor or a relative but my experience is from a real data with a 
significant quantity that we support on a daily basis. I currently have three 
of them assigned to me that I use daily as well (A T60 at home, a X32 for 
utility work and testing in the server room, and a T43 at my desk which is 
about to go back on lease which I will replace with a T61)<br>
<br>
Overall, 
the quality on these laptops is outstanding and they are very durable and very 
stable. I'm not comparing them to any other current companies offerings because 
I can not (other then the HP/Compaq models we had years ago maybe).<br>
So 
overall, we have not seen any reduction in quality over the past few years, no 
increase in maintenance costs, and they are very reliable units.<br>
YMMV.

<blockquote> <i> Honestly only an idiot would buy a MacBook and run Windows 
instead of OS X.</i> </blockquote> 
<p> Well, not exactly. Sort of. For instance, I run Windows XP sandboxed on my 
dual core MacBook Pro laptop, and that's the only place I run Windows at all. 
Windows isn't allowed to get to the net where it can get hurt, I just use it to 
host a few desktop applications that don't have Mac equivalents. WithParallels 
[parallels.com] &quot;coherence&quot; mode, I'm in the OSX filesystem for the 
images and other files I use under Windows, but I have the Mac right there 
doing the right things for everything else.</p> 
<p> I also run a linux install pretty much the same way (though no coherence, 
unfortunately.) The linux install is allowed on the net because it considerably 
more secure &quot;out there&quot; than Windows is. I can run all three OS's at 
once without any problem and get realistic performance from all of them.</p> 
<p> Hence, no need for a Windows machine, and no need to be an 
&quot;idiot&quot;, either. ;-) </p> 
<p> As for Vista... No need to go there. We won't be writing any applications 
using Vista specific capabilities, either. As far as I'm concerned, Vista was 
dead at the starting line.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

 Most of us 
manage to run Windows on the net confidently. If you prefer OS X or Linux 
that's fine, but don't act like security is the reason you're not on Windows 
and that you have to keep it separate from the net; I've had the same Windows 
XP install running for over a year and it runs as well as when I installed it, 
and there's no spyware.<br>
<br>
 As for writing code for Vista. Well I'd say 
give it time; people didn't write for XP the moment it came out either, it took 
a while for apps to stop supporting Win98, but as people update their computers 
and get Vista by default there'll be a transition, whether it's worthwhile or 
not. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

 Clearly spoken by someone who doesn't use Windows as a 
non-admin. I do, and it's perfectly usable. It has a sudo equivalent (&quot;Run 
as&quot;) for admin tasks, just like UNIX, you can configure it to allow writes 
only to your home folder, just like UNIX, you can install untrusted 
applications within your home folder, just like UNIX.<br>

 I don't 
know about the ipod effect, but something is definitely working, and I think 
some of it is quality and ease of use.<br>
<br>
I looked around in a large 
lecture hall class of 100+ at University of Florida and 4/5 of the laptops were 
macs of some sort, and most of those were the new macbooks. They are at the 
price point parents can afford to get their kids (I mean seriously.... a crap 
dell of for a few hundred more something that won't burn down the dorm room), 
small enough to put in a backpack (there is a lot of wasted screen real-estate 
compared to the powerbook, but alas they still get the job done), and are 
powerful enough to do almost anything a college class could require (except 
maybe some 3d graphics work - FCP works fine).<br>
<br>
When I got my powerbook 
a few years back it was almost a grand more than many other laptops (sony vaios 
and some upper end thinkpads aside), but the difference is I am still using it, 
and despite having it get pulled off a desk by my dog twice and being dropped, 
bumped, and lugged around to 3 jobs, clients houses, and college classes it is 
still working great. The screen was starting to degrade so I replaced it for 
$210, but that was ENTIRELY my fault. If it were most other machines it would 
be in the garbage. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>Three years ago I helped my parents find a great deal on a Dell laptop for 
my sister, who was just heading off to college at NYU. I was rather pleased 
with myself too; we used one of those 50% off coupons I found and got a 
great-spec machine for the price.</p> 
<p>When the family got together for the holidays I asked her how the computer 
was working out; she complained to me that all the cool kids had MacBooks and 
she was &quot;embarrassed to be seen in public with the ugly Dell next to all 
the sleek Macs.&quot;</p> 
<p>So I can honestly say the Apple's success here is unsurprising to me; the 
laptop market is one that is well-suited to Apple's core strengths. Though a 
desktop is largely perceived as an appliance - it's an utilitarian box that you 
use to do stuff with - a laptop has the additional function of being a status 
symbol and expression of personal taste. Your desktop stays at home, but you 
can carry your laptop around with you. An iMac may look great, but its 
usefulness as a signifier of taste is constrained by the simply fact that it 
stays in your room. Now that the laptop market has become so important, Apple 
is in a great position to capitalize on their previously under-exploited brand 
identity.</p> 
<p>And this is before we even consider Apple's incredibly devious &quot;buy a 
Macbook, get an iPod&quot; promotion. If Mom and Dad offer to buy you a 
computer for college, are you going to choose the PC or the Mac that comes with 
a great MP3 player? Unless you're a gamer, you're going to opt for the latter

 I'm (non-teaching) graduate-level support staff in 
astronomy at a state university known for its graduate-level astronomy program, 
and from what I see among the post-docs, professors and staff I work with, both 
at the university and elsewhere through collaborations, I think Apple's market 
share in some of the sciences is significantly better than one-in-six laptops, 
and has been for the last few years. A friend who did database work for an 
observatory told me of going to an ADASS conference a couple years ago, and 
getting looks of pity because he had the only non-Mac laptop in the room.<br>

<br>Why is this the case? It's not about iPods and it's not about Vista. It's 
about UNIX, X, and Boot Camp/Parallels/VMWare. The professor who used to have a 
Sparc, a PC<i>and</i> a PPC Mac in his office now just does his 
number-crunching and scientific visualization on an 8-core Mac Pro with dual

I guess). Earlier this month, I actually worked with three of them one night, 
and they brought 2 laptops with them - both Macs. I never thought I'd ever see
<i>any</i> &quot;American&quot; brand become that popular with the Japanese 
scientists. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

Now, apple 
upgrade pricing is a scam, but you don't have to buy your 2nd stick of ram or 
hard drive upgrade from Apple.<br>
<br>
Most of the price difference between 
Apple and PC is actually represented in the 2ndary specs, and build quality. If 
you were to spec a dell or asus that matches on all the 2ndary features, the 
price premium for apple is a pittance. (Now whether you want or care about 
those features is a separate issue.)<br>
<br>
<i>Instead I bought a ASUS laptop 
with 2GB of RAM, a 7200RPM HD, a Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz and a Nvidia Geforce 8600M 
GPU.</i> <br>
<br>
Good on you, for finding what you need. Is it a better deal 
than an apple? Hard to say.<br>
<br>
You paid 1500 for it, and the 15-inch 
apple MBPro is 1999, or 30% more (hardly the twice you were moaning about). 
That gets you an 8600M GPU, 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo CPU, and 5400 rpm drive. Sounds 
about even for 499 more, right? Slight bump up on the cpu, but a hit on HD 
speed.<br>
<br>
So... does the asus have firewire? (firewire 800 no less?) 
gigabit or just 10/100? a camera? bluetooth? a remote control? microphone? is 
it heavier or lighter? is it thinner or thicker? Does it have a remote? DVI out 
or only VGA? 802.11n or just a/b/g? is the keyboard backlit? Does it have a 
magnetic release on the power-cord? express-card slot?<br>
<br>
Im sure the 
asus has at least some of those. But I doubt it has most of them. And if you 
add it all up, there is a good chunk of value in there, easily enough to 
justify the extra 400-500 for a lot of people.<br>
<br>
And that's before we 
get into the ease of use, virus situation, unix under the hood, and other soft 
advantages of the Mac OS platform.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a mac 
fanboy, and I'm not saying a Mac is right for everyone. My last purchase was a 
4GB RAM 3.1GHz (2.5GHz overclocked) Core2 Quad PC with Vista U x64 / Ubuntu 
Feisty x64 on separate 500GB drives, and an 8600GTS; I have no regrets; the 
iMac was worlds away from what I needed (hello PCI slots for testing medical 
video capture equipment). And a Mac Pro simply wasn't a good value for this 
unit. (That said, my next purchase is likely to be a Mac Book Pro 15&quot;.)<br>
<br>But I am defending Apples product and pricing as good value, because for 
what you get, it is. (upgrade pricing aside!) It might not be what YOU or I 
need, from a given system, but that's a separate issue.<br>

 In addition to 
that, they have hit the sweetest spots on both desktop and laptop markets with 
their high-end intel based hardware. I am no fanboy, used windows (games, dev) 
linux and BSD (most everything else) in the past, now I bought the second 
macbook pro model and I am blown away by the quality of the hardware. My god.. 
a REAL wireless card that actually supports passive monitoring? And a 
mid-to-high range nvidia 8600GT with enough speed and RAM to run anything 
graphical AND support Direct X 10 on Vista, which you can boot up natively like 
a charm with apple software? I tell you, it's a good laptop, and considering it 
has the absolute top of the line intel has to offer in terms of mobile 
processors, plus 2 gigs of main mem, plus all the normal fun stuff, it's worth 
the 2.5 thou. This is many times better than the crappy plastic dell, alienware 
and even Asus (which I hugely respect for quality engineering) will sell you. 
It's not just that the hardware is better, the bootcamp deal gives people al

 It is definitely not my reason for owning a macbook, but I heard 
that several times:<br>
<br>
&quot;.... and it can also run Windows if I really 
need it for something .....&quot; <br>
<br>
I think the Intel switch and the 
option to run Windows is a huge selling point for many.<br>
<br>
For me on the 
other hand is that it is the only laptop that actually runs UNIX out of the box 
with a functional desktop, without constant headaches for drivers and all.<br>

<br>I respect, love and use Linux every day, but when you face all the little 
quirks of a laptop when trying to put Linux on it (especially a new one) you 
know what I am talking about. And when you think you solved it all, you realize 
that your battery dies a lot faster, or your backlight just does not go out 
when the screen saver starts.<br>
<br>
I myself own a Macbook, and while I have 
seen many OSes, touched and owned many hardware devices, I have to say that 
this was my best ever computer/OS selection. I admin servers and develop mostly 
for LAMP web, if you wondered, and yes I also enjoy having a decent DVD player 
program with a remote under UNIX (yes mplayer + lirc + whatever - but i mean 
out of the box, not after 3 days of hacking)<br>

 The 
numbers in the summary do not include direct sales (i.e., nearly all corporate

channels through which laptops are sold. The article, however, does include the 
full numbers:<br>
<br>
<i> <b>Apple's share of U.S. [laptop] sales [is] 5.6%, 
far behind leaders HP (28.4%) and Dell (23.6%) but tied with Gateway.</b> </i> 
<br> <br>
In other words, Apple sells 1 laptop in 20 (in the USA; it's closer 
to 1 in 50 if you look at global numbers), not 1 in 6. Not quite as impressive 
as the summary or title make it appear, eh?<br>

 I live in Boston, Mass. and here it 
seems that most of the computers are Macs (as far as laptops go). Go into any 
coffeeshop, and well, it's all Macs. We hosted a Plone Sprint and training 
session here, and it was about 70% Macbook Pros (we converted one guy halfway 
though, and I bought a new MBP then as well). The office I worked in, which is 
a co-working suite called the Betahouse in Cambridge (it's all web developers) 
is 90% Mac.<br>
<br>
 Maybe it's just the huge number of 'creatives' in the 
city, but it seems that around NYC and Boston, that Apple's pretty well taken 
over. Hell, my office has 70% of the people carrying iPhones (and that was true 
the first week they were out). I have yet to actually see anyone with a Zune. 
Period.<br>
<br>
 What's odd is that I lived in North Carolina for about 8 
months, and most of the computers there were Windows-based PCs. My 4 macs were 
seen as oddities down there. Here it's par for the course. Share twitter

 I am no 
Apple fanboy, been around /. for enough years to be pretty cynical about all 
corporations and technology cheerleaders but I bought a MacBook Pro about two 
months ago and am surprised to have come to the conclusion that it's the best 
piece of hardware I've ever owned.<br>
<br>
 I don't mean that in a fevered, 
evangelical way because, really, I don't care what the rest of the world uses 
but for me, personally, switching has made a big difference to my productivity 
and enjoyment of computers - I'd kind of forgotten the excitement I used to 
feel back in the day.<br>
<br>
 Over the past couple of years, Apple seem to be 
have been slowly but steadily<i>getting it right</i> in a sustained manner that 
I suspect will come more clearly to fruition when Leopard is released in 
October. I was kind of slow to notice this build-up, kind of resistant to the 
idea of buying into the cult of Apple and probably should have made the switch 
sooner, could have used this productivity boost a year ago, but, whatever, I'm 
glad that I eventually cottoned on.<br>
<br>
 Again, I don't much care what the 
rest of the world does as long as my experience and working environment keep 
improving. Some enjoy treating this as a spectator sport, like a never-ending 
baseball match between Apple and Microsoft, enjoying each play that seems to 
bring victory that little bit nearer. Bollox.<br>
<br>
 Sure, Apple probably 
will see quite a jump by the holiday season but Microsoft have simply dominated 
the market for too long to be pushed aside - the vast majority of people don't 
know<i>and don't care to know much about computers</i> and will happily 
&quot;upgrade&quot; to Vista when their existing machines die. What we will 
see, however, is a fairly fast and comprehensive migration towards Mac by 
programmers and other people who need to be creative and productive with 
computers. That probably represents just 15% of the market but it's an 
important 15% and giving those people better tools to do what they do is going 
to be beneficial for everyone.<br>
<br>
 In the meantime, I certainly recommend 
giving the whole Mac proposition a closer look, you might find yourself as 
surprised as I have been. Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>Here's what I don't like. </p> 
<ul> 
<li>The OS/X user interface is crap. 
<ol> 
<li>The application menu constrained to the top of the screen hides 
information present in other applications and forces the user to either learn 
all the shortcut keys or suffer rediculous amounts of additional mouse travel.
</li> 
<li>A single mouse button was NEVER a good idea. It's a terrible idea 
actually. It was terrible when the macintosh was launched and never got better. 
If you're too stupid to figure out the different functions of two to five mouse 
buttons then you shouldn't be allowed to have a computer and you should stick 
with pencil and paper. I've got ten fingers and I can move them independently. 
Why should I have to be limited to operating a computer like I have mittens on 
one hand? At least the mighty mouse fixes a lot of this. But Apple certainly 
could have put two buttons under the mouse bar, one under each end. Just 
program OS/X to do the same thing should either button be pressed to make the 
mac zealots happy and then for other operating system bred people you could 
send the normal left/right/middle events.</li> 
<li>Finder is a joke. Why does Apple hype this &quot;application&quot; up so 
much?? It's a frickin' directory browser people!</li> 
<li>Glitz wise they just aren't keeping up. Compviz/Beryl for instance is way 
better than the eye-candy offered by either OS/X or Vista these days.</li> </ol>
</li> 
<li>Hot!! Oh my god! don't set it on your lap if you have shorts. And this is 
the newer model without the battery problems.</li> </ul> 
<p> Ok, so why do I LIKE it (a lot)? </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Design: The design is sleek and simple. It's the fastest laptop I've ever 
owned and yet it is also the thinnest. It's no thicker than my fujitsu P7010 is 
but it's about five times faster. (Though its footprint is much bigger too.)
</li> 
<li>backlit keyboard keys</li> 
<li>Ambient light sensitive backlight (both lcd and keyboard)</li> 
<li>USB AND Firewire ports!</li> 
<li>Neodynium Magnetic power jack. (Yes, I've tripped over, and destroyed, 
power cables before. This solution is just tits!)</li> 
<li>Great sound, even from the speakers</li> 
<li>Solid feel. Nothing seems to bend where it shouldn't. Hinges operate 
crisply and smoothly.</li> 
<li>Absence of any stickers plastered all over it to provide useless FCC crap.
</li> 
<li>Incredibly bright LED backlit screen.</li> 
<li>Built in 802.11N AND Bluetooth</li> 
<li>2.4 Core 2 duo processors. That's as fast as any of my workstations save 
one. This makes it a workstation replacement by far. A better docking interface 
(such as power on the same side as DVI/USB) would have been a good idea.)</li> 
<li>Intel based. I hate windows but my CAD program is only available for 
Windows. Windows needs an x86 CPU. Yes, you could use fusion or parallels to 
run windows, I know. Have you ever actually tried to work on a multi-dozen part 
3D CAD assembly and compared your productivity of a native OS versus a virtual 
machine? Big difference! So I get to run windows natively and work remotely and 
do it fast..</li> 
<li>Fast Nvidia GPU. I'm not an ATI fan but either way, great graphics</li>

or suffer rediculous amounts of additional mouse travel.</i> <br>
<br>
Said 
applications should be designed to show whatever information might be useful in 
some other location than a menu bar. And the extra mouse travel distance is not 
a problem because it's easier to hit a target always at the top of the screen 
than one that might be mixed around other menus (In Windows I've found myself 
accidentally raising windows I did not mean to when I mistook which menu bar 
was for the active window).<br>
<br>
<i>A single mouse button was NEVER a good 
idea.</i> <br>
<br>
You say that now but when you realize how much more 
manageable a single large button is that you can chord into two, vs. two mouse 
buttons on a laptop where at least one is awkward to hit... on top of that 
applications are designed to work with one mouse button instead of requiring 
two,<br>
<br>
The single button design aspect across all Mac platforms is what 
allows the laptops to be especially usable.<br>
<br>
<i>The iPod. A product 
that outclassed the competition by a mile. This made them profitable and 
restored people's trust in apple producing a reliable, desirable product.</i> 
<br> <br>
Apple was quite profitable, and had a huge cash reserve, well before 
the iPod when they were just selling iMacs and OS X. The iPod did vault them 
into a new straosphere of awareness and is obviously having an effect though.

<p>A question for you: What is it about OS X that makes it good for 
audio/video/graphic work? That's your assertion, so I assume you have at least 
of some reason to believe it.</p> 
<p>If you're confused as to why some choose OS X then I would suggest doing 
some research into the features that madeNEXTSTEP a compelling Unix Desktop and 
workstation in the 90s [google.ca]. For instance: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Why Tim Berners-Lee chose NEXTSTEP as the platform on which to develop 
the world's first Web Browser and Web Server [w3.org].</li> 
<li>Why id Software chose NEXTSTEP to develop their landmark Doom and Quake 
[rome.ro] games for the PC.</li> 
<li>What's compelling about NEXTSTEP/Cocoa APIs, Interface Builder [sun.com], 
and what influence didObjective-C have on Java [google.com]?</li> 
<li>Why were Linux users so enthusiastic about NEXTSTEP-derived window 
managers, such asWindowMaker [akropolix.net] and AfterStep [cmdrtaco.net]? What 
lead to the development ofGNUStep [gnustep.org]?</li> </ul> 
<p>That's NEXTSTEP. </p> 
<p>Now, say you chose NEXTSTEP as the basis for <b> <i>your</i> </b> perfect 
operating system and desktop environment. You get to keep all of the good 
design decisions, throw away or refactor all of the bad design decisions, and 
do it without any backward compatibility restrictions. What you end up with is 
OS X.</p> 
<p>But why an Apple laptop? Here's why: I can open up a bunch of SSH and X11 
sessions to a remote server over wi-fi, close the lid and throw it in my 
back-pack, go eat lunch, come back and open the lid, and all of my remote X11 
apps and sessions are still alive. OS X just works damn well on Apple's laptop 
hardware.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>
