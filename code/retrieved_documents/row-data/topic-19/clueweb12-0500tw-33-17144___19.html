<p>Attention Apple users: if you've long suspected that you are, in fact, 
actually cooler than your PC-adoring counterparts, new data suggests you're 
right.</p> 
<p>A study conducted by the data-driven review site Bundle analyzed data from 
over 700,000 PC and Mac buyers on how and where they spend their money.</p> 
<p>Their conclusion: Mac users really are more fashion-forward and 
style-conscious than PC users.</p> 
<p>Shots fired?</p> 
<p>Bundle's research examined which stores computer users tend to favor. They 
found that while Mac users are more likely to drop tons of cash at luxury 
stores like Jimmy Choo, PC users lean towards more modest price points, like 
Old Navy. Even while outlet shopping, Mac users seek to score bargains at 
stores like Coach and Last Call by Neiman Marcus; PC users tended to be fans of 
the Van Heusen outlet and Columbia Sportswear.</p> 
<p>So, maybe Apple fans are more likely to shell out for a pair of Tory Burch 
flats than their PC counterparts. But can you boil this argument down to the 
fact that Macs are simply more expensive than PCs, and thus its users tend to 
be more affluent? Perhaps: Bundle found that 40 percent of the anonymous Mac 
users they examined earned more than $100,000, compared with 29 percent of PC 
users.</p> 
<p>In addition, demographic data has long shown that Mac users skew younger, 
which could account for Apple fans' proclivity for hipper, trendier stores 
while their parents scour the racks at stodgier mainstream retailers.</p> 
<p>Click over to Bundle to read even more interesting findings from the study, 
and check out their fascinating infographic below to see precisely which stores 
Mac users favor over PC fans.<br>

 10 hours ago ( 1:53 AM)  As both a Windows 
user and Mac User, the Mac world is superior. Mac products are much easier to 
use and own, thus ideal for hipsters. They also have more style. And can be in 
long run cheaper, as they often do not need as many adds on as Windows products.

 17 hours ago ( 7:21 PM)  &quot;Apple users tend to have 
more money than PC users.&quot;<br>
 1) Apple users are PC users. <br>
<br>
 2) 
People often over-spend or spend on things they cannot afford but can still 
purchase. A poor person who spends money on an iPod vs their kids clothes 
cannot afford an iPod even though they have one.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Apple users 
are also more concerned about image than PC users (one can draw one's own 
conclusions about why that is).&quot;<br>
 1) Again, Apple users are PC users. 
<br> 2) Image is not preclusive to own an item, however it is often the 
deciding factor for many people.  PenguinLinux: &quot;Apple users tend to have 
more money than PC users.&quot;<br>

 17 hours ago ( 7:19 PM)  Indeed. <br>
<br>
 Even a mobile 
device is technically a personal computer. I think embedded systems, such as on 
a car may be the exception to being a personal computer since that would really 
be a &quot;Component&quot;... so it boils down to Personal Computer / Component 
/ Main Frame  PenguinLinux: Indeed. Even a mobile device is technically a 
personal computer.<br>

19 hours ago ( 4:48 PM) Really, you are so attached to your brand that you're 
concerned about being lumped in with a group of more fashionable or less 
fashionable people? That's what an insecure sheep you are, Mr or Ms Consumer?

( 4:21 PM) I use a Mac because I'm in the business of computing my work, not 
working my computer.<br>

 There's just way more crap you have to deal with

PenguinLinux. Well said! As a designer it was a natural pick for me. For the 
exact reasons you stated. I do not thought it has to do with better taste or 
so-called style.<br>
 It is based on the individual needs.  Maureen_Stemberg:

(10:03 AM) Sigh. This idea that Macs are better for design, video, audio is 
just false. If you do believe this, it just tells me that you've succumb to 
Apple's marketing (which is pretty good) and don't know much about computers. 
I'm a tech guy and a designer, started with Mac and converted to PC (Windows). 
Everything a Mac can do, a PC (Windows) can do AND some. The two main 
differences: Mac's are prettier and easier to use. PCs give you more options 
and are more power-user friendly. One is not better than the other, it just 
depends on what type of user you are.  cac011: Sigh. This idea that Macs are 
better for design, video,<br>
