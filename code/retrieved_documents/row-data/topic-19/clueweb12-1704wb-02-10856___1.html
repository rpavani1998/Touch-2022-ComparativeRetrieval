<h2>PC or Mac</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p> If I had to choice between a PC or Mac, I would pick a PC because you can 
play more games on pc,and you can fix them fast.<br>
 First of all, Pc is 
better becuase you can play more games on them then Mac computers. Pc's can 
have bigger amount of RAM and a better CPU then Mac. Playing games on a Pc, you 
have have to have a good RAM and CPU. You have to have a fan so your computer 
wont over heat.<br>
 Second of all, Pc's are much easier to fix then Mac's 
because all you have to do is remove the protecter that cover all of the 
thing's inside of the computer and then, replace what wasn't wrond in the 
computer. With mac's, you have to do more work opening the computer.<br>
 So, 
those are the reasons why Pc's and better then Mac's. One because they can play 
more video games on Pc's , and Pc's are easier to fix.</p>
