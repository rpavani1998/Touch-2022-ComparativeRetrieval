<h3>Operating System and Browser Shares for April</h3> 
<p>Windows slipped a bit more in April, but the Mac OS lost share too, and all 
the other significant players gained or held their ground, and iPad already at 
0.03%. In browser space, Internet Explorer is still losing ground, falling 
below 60%, and Firefox is up marginally, edging closer to one-quarter of the 
browser market, with Chrome, again the biggest gainer in April.</p> 
<p>Here's the Operating System Total Market Share rundown of the significant 
players for April 2010 (March '10 figures in parentheses) showing the change 
during the past month, with Windows slipping a bit more, but the Mac OS losing 
share too. Linux and all the other significant players gained or held their 
ground.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Windows 91.40 (91.58%)</li> 
<li>Mac 5.32% (5.33%)</li> 
<li>Linux 1.05% (1.03%)</li> 
<li>JavaME 0.79% (0.78)</li>

<li>SunOS 0.01% (0.01%)</li> </ul> 
<p>In terms of specific versions OS, Windows 7's momentum continues, 
accelerating slightly, while Windows XP and Vista are fading, and Apple's 
OS&nbsp;X 10.6 Snow Leopard is now the most prolific Mac OS version prowling, 
more than tripling OS&nbsp;X 10.4 Tiger's receding user share - a contrast with 
Windows, whose OS&nbsp;X 10.4 contemporary Windows XP is still far and away the 
most prolific version in the Windows space.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Windows:</b> 
<ul>

below 60%, and Firefox is up marginally, edging closer to one-quarter of the 
browser market. Chrome is again the biggest gainer again in April among the 
major browsers, with Safari gaining a hair, Opera losing a bit of ground, and 
Opera Mini remaining the 6th place browser and gaining slightly.</p>

<h3>Is Apple Giving OX a Second Place Behind the iPhone OS?</h3> 
<p>Computerworld blogger Mitch Wagner says:</p> 
<p>&quot;Apple announced the dates of its annual Worldwide Developers 
Conference. We're seeing rumors that the next-generation iPhone will be 
announced and available at the June event. But Apple seems to be giving the 
cold shoulder to its longtime mainstay business: The Mac....</p> 
<p>&quot;The focus is heavily iPhone OS centric. There are some Mac OS X 
developer sessions and labs, but not many. (Translation: Mac OS&nbsp;X 10.7 is 
not going to be announced this year.) The IT track appears to be gone. Looking 
at the session list, one could argue that this year's WWDC is an iPhone OS 
developers conference, not an Apple developers conference. Look no further than 
this year's Apple Design Awards, which will only honor iPhone and iPad apps - 
no category for Mac apps....&quot;</p> 
<p>Link: Is Apple Making the Mac a Second-class Citizen?</p> 
<h3>Has Apple Abandoned the Mac?</h3> 
<p>technobuffalo.com says:</p> 
<p>&quot;Perhaps 'abandoned' is too strong of a word, but it sure does seem 
that Apple's interest in its flagship Mac product line seems to be waning 
somewhat....</p> 
<p>&quot;While I certainly don't feel that Apple is about to kill off the Macs 
anytime soon, it does feel like the company is lessening the importance of the 
product line inside of its corporate structure, and amongst the developers. In 
case you hadn't noticed, when the last update to the MacBook Pros happened, 
there were some major changes made to the product line. Normally this would 
have involved Steve Jobs having one of his keynote talks where he gathers the 
press on short notice, but this last time around it just all happened on the 
Apple Store website without any fanfare.</p> 
<p>&quot;Something is changing over the corporate headquarters at One Infinity 
Loop to be sure, but what the end game is is known only to the company 
executives.&quot;</p> 
<p>Link: Has Apple Abandoned the Mac?</p> 
<h3>Steve Jobs: Apple Is Not De-emphasizing Mac OS X</h3> 
<p>Loop Insight's Jim Dalrymple reports:</p> 
<p>&quot;In announcing the dates for its Worldwide Developers Conference on 
Wednesday, Apple upset some of its Macintosh developers. But Apple is not 
abandoning the Mac platform.&quot;</p> 
<p>Link:  Steve Jobs Says Apple Is Not De-emphasizing Mac OS X</p> 
<h3>A Call to Action on Those Mac-less Apple Design Awards</h3> 
<p>Macsimum News' Dennis Sellers says:</p> 
<p>&quot;Okay, I'm still hacked off that Apple is only allowing iPhone and 
iPad apps in the 2010 Apple Design Awards. Various stories have already been 
written about this (links at the bottom). Now it's time for a call to 
action....&quot;</p> 
<p>Link:  A Call to Action on Those Mac OS-less Apple Design Awards</p> 
<h3>Those Who Know Use Chrome</h3> 
<p>ZDNet blogger Garett Rogers says:</p> 
<p>&quot;Are your parents using Chrome yet? Likely not, but they should be - 
it's secure enough for even for them. That said, Chrome is the browser of 
choice for a good chunk of people - but it's still limited to 'those who know'. 
Know what you ask? Know that Google Chrome is extremely fast, secure, and out 
of your face.</p> 
<p>&quot;Where I work, almost every developer uses Chrome....</p> 
<p>&quot;Do you use Chrome yet? If not, why not?&quot;</p> 
<p>Link: Those Who Know Use Chrome</p> 
<h3>Why Is Google's Chrome Getting So Much Attention?</h3> 
<p>ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes observes that Net Applications' data for 
April is out, showing that Google Chrome is the only browser making any real 
usage gains, with Safari and Firefox only making tiny gains, while Opera lost 
and Internet Explorer lost even more, and asks &quot;Why?&quot;</p> 
<p>Short answer: Because it's a really great browser.</p> 
<p>&quot;What is it about Chrome that people like?&quot; Kingsley-Hughes 
queries. &quot;Is it that's a lightweight browser, or the fact that it's pretty 
secure? Or maybe it's because of its minimalistic look and feel? Or the no-fuss 
way it updates itself? Is is that it's new? Is it because Google is pushing it 
hard through various channels?&quot;</p> 
<p>Editor's note: Your editor would say all of the above, save for the last 
two speculatives, plus the facts that its really fast, has a kick-ass, no-fuss 
Download manager, and generally hauls the mail.<i>cm</i></p>

<h3>Am I No Longer an Apple Fan Boy If I Use Google?</h3> 
<p>The Other Mac Blog's Colum O' Dwyer says:</p> 
<p>&quot;For the past 9 years or so I have been an Apple Fan Boy, running this 
website is the culmination of that fact. For the majority of those 9 years 
Apple was taking on Microsoft and so I swore of the Windows OS and begrudgingly 
used Microsoft Office for Mac until iWork 09 was released.</p> 
<p>&quot;While Apple was taking on Microsoft another tech giant, Google, was 
growing. For Apple Fan Boys like myself Google seemed a natural extension to 
the Apple culture. I embraced Gmail, Gchat, Google search and the other 
products of Google Labs. Hell, Apple had members of Google sitting on Apple's 
Board. However, in the past year Mac, general tech, and mainstream media have 
begun to hype a growing competition between Google and Apple.</p> 
<p>&quot;This means over the past year, as a self proclaimed Apple Fan Boy, I 
have begun to wonder if I will have to choose sides between Apple and 
Google....&quot;</p>

<h3>Ultimate Collection of Google Related Mac Apps</h3> 
<p>AppStorm's Joshua Johnson reports:</p> 
<p>&quot;Google is undisputedly one of the best providers of free 
technological resources and applications on the planet. Though they tend to 
favor PCs with earlier releases of new software, eventually they get around to 
throwing Mac users some great apps as well.</p> 
<p>&quot;Below is a huge list of both official Google and third party Mac 
applications, desktop widgets and plugins. Most are free downloads but there 
are a few that you'll have to purchase. These usually stay within the $10-$20 
range.</p> 
<p>&quot;Just to be thorough, let's start out the list with the official 
Google apps that you're probably already familiar with. All of these 
applications are free, ready to download, and possess the high quality you'd 
expect from Google.&quot;</p>

<h3>27&quot; iMac Fans Running Full Speed after SMC Update</h3> 
<p>MacFixIt's Joe Aimonetti reports:</p> 
<p>&quot;Users have experienced an issue where the fans in their late-2009 
27-inch iMacs run at full speed after installing the SMC firmware update 1.0.
</p> 
<p>&quot;In cases where this happens, it is most likely the result of the SMC 
update not being applied properly....&quot;</p>

<h2>Ubuntu</h2> 
<h3>Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx Released</h3> 
<p><b>PR:</b> Linux distro Canonical has released Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid 
Lynx) in Desktop, Server and Netbook editions. Featuring a new look that some 
rate more attractive and up-to-date than Snow Leopard's, &quot;Lucid 
Lynx's&quot; new graphics card drivers and other consumer-oriented innovations 
front a Linux-based operating system package containing all the essential 
productivity applications you need for free: a web browser, office suite, media 
apps, instant messaging and much more, and is being pitched as an open-source 
alternative to Windows and Office or Mac OS X and the iApps. Ubuntu's core 
applications are all free and open source.</p> 
<p>Last year's Ubuntu 9.04 release included the Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR) 
designed for small screened netbook devices. Also noteworthy was the inclusion 
of Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) which enabled organizations to deploy a 
private computing cloud in their own data center. The Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook 
Edition brings all the advantages of Ubuntu to your mini-netbook - optimised 
for smaller screens,</p> 
<p>Ubuntu 10.04 is distributed on four types of images:</p> 
<h4>Desktop CD</h4> 
<p>The desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at 
all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type of CD is 
what most people will want to use. You will need at least 256 MB of RAM to 
install from this CD.</p> 
<p>There are two images available, each for a different type of computer:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>PC (Intel x86) desktop CD - For almost all PCs. This includes most 
machines with Intel/AMD/etc. type processors and almost all computers that run 
Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel 
processors. Choose this if you are at all unsure.</li> 
<li>64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD - Choose this to take full advantage of 
computers based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, 
EM64T Xeon, Core 2). If you have a non-64-bit processor made by AMD, or if you 
need full support for 32-bit code, use the Intel x86 images instead.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Server install CD</h4> 
<p>The server install CD allows you to install Ubuntu permanently on a 
computer for use as a server. It will not install a graphical user interface.
</p> 
<p>There are two images available, each for a different type of computer:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>PC (Intel x86) server install CD - For almost all PCs. This includes most

Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel 
processors. Choose this if you are at all unsure.</li>

need full support for 32-bit code, use the Intel x86 images instead.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Alternate install CD</h4> 
<p>The alternate install CD allows you to perform certain specialist 
installations of Ubuntu. It provides for the following situations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>setting up automated deployments;</li> 
<li>upgrading from older installations without network access;</li> </ul> 
<p>LVM and/or RAID partitioning;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>installs on systems with less than about 256 MB of RAM (although note that 
low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop environment 
reasonably).</li> </ul> 
<p>There are two images available, each for a different type of computer:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>PC (Intel x86) alternate install CD - For almost all PCs. This includes 
most machines with Intel/AMD/etc. type processors and almost all computers that

by AMD, or if you need full support for 32-bit code, use the Intel x86 images 
instead.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Netbook live CD</h4> 
<p>The live CD allows you to try Ubuntu Netbook Edition without changing your 
computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This live 
CD is optimized for netbooks with screens up to 10&quot;. You will need at 
least 256 MB of RAM to install from this CD.</p> 
<p>There is one image available:</p>

<h3>Ubuntu Lucid Lynx: A Mactastic Experience</h3> 
<p>The Register's Scott Gilbertson has posted a review of Ubuntu 10.04, 
officially available as of Thursday, noting that this is an important update 
for the popular Linux distro, combining new social network with media 
capabilities and a brace of online services with a brand new look.</p> 
<p>Gilbertson reports that Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth wants Ubuntu to 
beat Mac OS&nbsp;X on features and interface polish, and while Lucid Lynx still 
has some rough edges, this release is a huge leap for UI design in Linux and 
puts Ubuntu well on its way to Shuttleworth's goal with an array of new 
applications, features, and services that make Ubuntu seem more like a 
consumer-friendly operating system (like OS&nbsp;X) rather than the Linux of 
the command line loving past.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu 10.04: Never a Better Time to Switch</h3> 
<p>ZDNet Education blogger Christopher Dawson says he's been using the betas 
of Ubuntu 10.04, the final releases of which launched last week, in both 
desktop and server environments for a while, and has been incredibly pleased. 
He suggests that school IT departments should seriously consider Ubuntu instead 
of (or in addition to) Windows 7, Mac OS&nbsp;X, and various server upgrades 
when updating their systems over the summer break, noting that there are 
probably plenty of places where the latest and greatest (and it really is 
great) release from Canonical can save you money and hassle in the long run.</p>

<h3>Scan, Share, and Recycle with the New Visioneer Strobe 400</h3> 
<p><b>PR:</b> Small mobile scanner helps users reduce their paper regeneration 
by digitizing paper documents and sharing them electronically</p> 
<p>Visioneer, a specialist in intelligent document imaging solutions, today 
announced the Strobe 400, a new duplex color scanner designed for busy people 
who need a fast and reliable scanning solution that can be used anywhere. The 
Strobe 400 is slim and lightweight, measuring only 11.6&quot; x 2.5&quot; x 
2&quot; and weighs a mere 22 ounces and when used in duplex mode, the Strobe 
400 scans both sides of the page in only 6 seconds. Priced at $299.99, the 
Strobe 400 is one of the most affordable &quot;green&quot; scanning solutions 
available for PC or Mac.</p> 
<p>&quot;While we may never become truly paperless, we believe you can have a 
'less paper' office,&quot; said John Capurso, vice president of marketing at 
Visioneer. &quot;The Strobe 400 is a great, low cost solution for anyone 
looking to reduce the amount of paper in their life and Visioneer will plant a 
tree on behalf of every customer who registers a new scanner through our 
partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation.&quot;</p> 
<h4>Make a Commitment to Sustainability</h4> 
<p>Scanning is a highly effective green technology. By digitizing documents, 
they can be shared in electronic form rather than sharing via fax, reprinting 
or copying, saving the user time, money and valuable resources. Any business 
that handles paper can benefit from using a scanner. Whether scanning 
contracts, forms, receipts, photos, ID cards, handwritten notes or virtually 
any document of varying size or complexity, the Strobe 400 meets the changing 
needs of users in many paper-intensive markets.</p> 
<p>Healthcare - By scanning patient documents, insurance cards and driver's 
license at patient registration and creating a digital image accessible to the 
patient's authorized care providers, hospitals can reduce registration time, 
solve data inaccuracy problems and improve customer relationships.</p> 
<p>Banking - The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21) allows 
banks to replace original paper checks with &quot;substitute checks&quot; that 
are scanned digital copies of the originals. Check 21 reduces the time, risks 
and costs associated with paper check processing and accelerates cash flow for 
retail merchants, small/medium businesses and civic organizations.</p> 
<p>Insurance/Financial Services - From Sarbanes-Oxley to the PATRIOT act, 
records management has become an important part of doing business. A document 
scanner is therefore essential to first digitize paper records into electronic 
files that can be securely and accurately stored, transmitted and retrieved.</p>
<p>Traveling Professionals - Road warriors looking to maximize productivity 
can quickly capture the day's contracts, business cards, briefing papers, and 
expense receipts.</p> 
<p>The Strobe 400 can be connected to computer quickly via the Hi-Speed USB 
2.0 interface and has a resolution of 600 DPI. It incorporates Visioneer 
OneTouch with Kofax VRS technology to create perfect images from imperfect 
originals by which users can scan, file and store all of their documents, 
plastic ID cards, checks, articles, brochures and business cards. Productive in 
any location, the Strobe 400 may be powered through the computer's USB port, or 
via wall-power. The Strobe 400 includes patented Paper Driven and AutoLaunch 
technologies so scanning begins as soon as a document is inserted into the 
scanner. It will also automatically convert, at the user's option, any scanned 
item into a text-searchable PDF file while maintaining the visual integrity of 
the original document.</p> 
<h4>Intelligent Flexibility</h4> 
<p>Powered by Visioneer OneTouch technology, users may scan to the 
&quot;destination&quot; of their choice by pressing a single button, 
eliminating multiple steps usually required to save scanned documents in 
popular file formats. This enables your documents to be scanned with the 
correct settings for resolution, color, cropping, file format and then 
delivered to virtually any application, folder or device - all at the touch of 
a button. Bundled software includes Nuance&reg; PaperPort, OmniPage Pro, 
NewSoft Presto! BizCard, an enhanced TWAIN and WIA driver and Visioneer 
OneTouch with Kofax VRSTM technology for the PC. The Strobe 400 supports Mac 
users with ExactScanTM, a driver and capture application that integrates with 
the OneTouch scanning buttons, plus NewSoft Presto! PageManager&reg;.</p> 
<p>Priced at $299.99 US List price, the Strobe 400 is available through online 
channel partners and major resellers. Configured as a dual platform product, 
the Strobe 400 bundled software and drivers support Windows 7, Vista, and XP, 
as well as Mac OS X 10.4 and above, including Snow Leopard.</p> 
<h4>Visioneer's Sustainability Program</h4> 
<p>Visioneer is committed to conserving natural resources and minimizing our 
impact on the environment. We actively implement measures to increase 
efficiency, conserve energy and water, improve air quality, and reduce waste 
through our office building operations, waste management, and product 
development programs.</p>

<h3>Razer Abyssus Mirror Special Edition Gaming Mouse</h3> 
<p><b>PR:</b> Razer, specialist high-end precision gaming and lifestyle 
peripherals, announces the Razer Abyssus Mirror Special Edition gaming mouse. 
Combining a sleek and simple design with a high performance 3.5G 3500 dpi

edition black chrome mirror finish while maintaining all of the key features of 
the original Razer Abyssus.</p> 
<p>&quot;The black chrome mirror finish of the Razer Abyssus Mirror Special 
Edition adds a certain stylistic sensibility to the desktop,&quot; said Robert 
&quot;Razerguy&quot; Krakoff, president, Razer USA. &quot;The Razer Abyssus 
Mirror is designed for gamers that prefer a slick glossy aesthetic finish. It 
also serves as the ideal complement to other reflective peripherals, such as 
the Razer Lycosa&trade; Mirror Special Edition keyboard.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Razer Abyssus Mirror Special Edition was created specifically for 
gamers that demand the utmost in form and functionality, as well as reliability 
under the most intense gameplay conditions. The Razer Abyssus Mirror features a 
glossy finish and is equipped with two large buttons tuned for maximum tactile 
feedback, as well as Razer's signature Hyperesponse&trade; technology. 
Underneath, Razer has placed two easily accessible mechanical switches - one 
on-the-fly dpi switch giving the user their choice of 450, 1800, or 3500 dpi 
and one polling rate switch allowing instant adjustment from a standard 125 Hz 
to 1000 Hz Ultrapolling.</p> 
<p>At the Game Developers Conference at San Francisco in March, Razer 
announced an effort to increase support for Mac users by issuing driver support 
for all upcoming Razer products, including the Razer StarCraft II peripheral 
suite.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm very proud to say that at Razer, we are committed to supporting 
both Mac and PC gamers,&quot; said Robert &quot;Razerguy&quot; Krakoff, 
president, Razer USA. &quot;We are constantly working to increase driver 
support for Mac with our existing Razer products and have plans to release all 
of our new products with dedicated Mac and PC drivers. This is a really 
exciting opportunity to expand the gaming industry and make it more inclusive 
for Mac users by providing the same level of support that we give to our PC 
users.&quot;</p> 
<p>Razer offers several options for the Mac gaming community, providing full 
Mac support for the Razer Naga, the world's best selling MMO gaming mouse, as 
well as the Razer DeathAdder, a cult favorite among the right-handed gaming 
community. Razer is completely committed to supporting Mac users and will be 
releasing drivers to equip existing products with Mac compatibility. Basic Mac 
support is already available for the Razer Orochi, Razer Mamba and Razer 
Imperator, with further updates scheduled for later this year.</p>

<h3>Typinator 4 Adds QuickSearch - Like Spotlight for Text Snippets</h3> 
<p><b>PR:</b> Ergonis Software has announced the release and immediate 
availability of Typinator 4.0, a major leap forward in the evolution of text 
expanders. Typinator 4 introduces a new feature called &quot;QuickSearch&quot; 
that takes usage and management of text snippets to the next level. Instead of 
inventing and remembering hundreds of cryptic abbreviations, you just type a 
keyboard shortcut and enter a few characters. Typinator instantly displays a 
list of matching snippets. Pick the one that you want, and it appears in your 
document right away. It's like Spotlight for snippets, only much faster. 
QuickSearch can also be used for quickly opening and editing existing snippets.
</p> 
<p>&quot;When you start using a text expander, you typically set up five or 
ten abbreviations for the most frequently typed text snippets like your name, 
your address, the current date, your email address, and similar things. You 
choose good mnemonics and use them a lot. Over the time, however, you add more 
and more snippets, and you soon end up with forgetting the abbreviations that 
you defined. Thus, the potential productivity boost cannot be fully 
achieved,&quot; said Christoph Reichenberger, CEO of Ergonis Software. 
&quot;With Typinator 4, we found a great way to overcome this phenomenon. The 
new QuickSearch feature lets you define a hot key to bring up a search field. 
You enter a search string, Typinator pops up a list of matches, you select the 
one you want, and - boom - it appears in your document. This allows you to 
actively use a huge number of text snippets without having to remember their 
abbreviations.&quot;</p> 
<p>Besides this new killer feature, the new version delivers a number of other 
improvements like an option to globally enable and disable individual sets, 
further speed enhancements, increased compatibility with Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow 
Leopard) and many applications like Mellel, Nisus Writer Pro as well as 
smoother synchronization via Dropbox or Mobile Me.</p> 
<p>Typinator is a powerful, yet elegantly simple solution that works across 
all applications. It detects specific sequences of typed characters and 
automatically replaces them with text snippets, graphics, URLs, dates and 
special characters.</p> 
<p>For business users, Typinator leads to a layer of operational consistency 
and productivity across heterogeneous applications. A standard customer service 
response, a signature image on an email, a clause in a contract - each of these 
can be inserted in any application with just a couple of keystrokes. For 
technical users, Typinator automates typing of code and the implementation of 
documentation standards.</p> 
<p>Visit Ergonis Software's website to learn more about the changes in this 
release and to download and try the new version.</p> 
<p>System Requirements: Typinator 4 requires Mac OS X 10.4 or newer. Mac OS X 
10.6 or newer is recommended.</p> 
<p>Typinator 4 is a recommended update for everyone running on Mac OS X 10.6 
(Snow Leopard). Typinator can be purchased securely on the Ergonis Software 
website. The upgrade to Typinator 4 is free for all customers who purchased 
Typinator in the last 2 years. For information about purchases, including 
enterprise licenses, volume discounts, and upgrade pricing offers, see the 
company's web site.</p>
