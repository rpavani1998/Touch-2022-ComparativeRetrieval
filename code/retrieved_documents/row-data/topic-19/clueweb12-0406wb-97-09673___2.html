<h2>Why Does Windows Still Suck?</h2> 
<h3>05 Feb 05 by DL Byron </h3> 
<p> Writing a passionate article for the San Francisco Gate, Mark Morford asks
, &quot;Why Does Windows Still Suck? Why do PC users put up with so many 
viruses and worms? Why isn't everyone on a Mac?&quot; Mark asserts that there 
is a better way to compute and is puzzled as to why hordes of consumer aren't 
revolting in the streets, or the Redmond campus, over Windows. Well, consumers 
don't usually picket your store or campus, they just go somewhere else and I 
think there's a quiet revolution going on. I've switched, my developer friends 
have switched,Apple's retail stores are full, the Mac Mini is selling out, and 
Apple's brand isstronger than ever. </p> 
<p>More people are switching because they're just tired of Windows and realize 
there has to be a better way. This isn't about Mac v PC any longer, but a 
product that's broken vs one that works. As my latest friend to switch said, 
&quot;I don't care if it's Windows, Mac, Linux, or Joe Bob's OS, I just want it 
to work, not crash, and not continously need security updates.&quot; Right on. 
I can't disagree with that.</p>
