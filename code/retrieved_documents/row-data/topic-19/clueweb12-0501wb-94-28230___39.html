<pre> Viruses and the Macintosh ========================= by David Harley 
Version 1.6b: 7th January 2000 Significant changes from the previous version 
are flagged with + symbols in the first two columns at the start of the 
relevant line or section. Amendments of minor grammatical or syntactical errors 
are not flagged unless they affect factual accuracy or clarity. Sections tagged 
with [DH] or [SL] are hangovers from the time when maintenance of the FAQ was 
shared between David Harley and Susan Lesch, and usually denote personal 
opinions the originator didn't feel the other maintainer should be held 
responsible for. Untagged sections using the first person are usually 
attributable to David Harley. This version of the FAQ primarily reflects my 
involvement in setting up an information resource at ICSA. This will affect the 
availability of the FAQ. The next version will require extensive URL checking, 
and will probably introduce major formatting changes. David Harley Table of

============ This document is intended to help individuals with computer 
virus-related problems and queries, and clarify the issue of computer viruses 
on Macintosh platforms. It should *not* be regarded as being in any sense 
authoritative, and has no legal standing. The authors accept no responsibility 
for errors or omissions, or for any ill effects resulting from the use of any 
information contained in this document. Corrections and additional material are 
welcome, especially if kept polite.... Contributions will, if incorporated, 
remain the copyright of the contributor, and credited accordingly within the 
FAQ. David Harley &lt;D.Harley@icrf.icnet.uk&gt; 3.0 Availability of this FAQ 
============================= ++The reference site for this FAQ is now 
www.icsa.net. However, my own site at 
&lt;http://www.sherpasoft.org.uk/MacSupporters/&gt; will be the first place new 
versions will be posted. It's also available from Henri Delger's Prodigy 
Anti-Virus Center file library, as is thealt.comp.virus FAQ. It will probably 
be available shortly from &lt;www.eicar.dk&gt; There are HTML versions at: &lt;
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/computer-virus 
/macintosh-faq/faq.html&gt; &lt;

&lt;http://emt.doit.wisc.edu/macvir/macvir.html&gt; I have no control over the 
content of these sites, and can't guarantee that they're up-to-date. 4.0 
Mission Statement ====================== This document is a little different to 
thealt.comp.virus FAQ, which David Harley also co-maintains (at time of 
writing). It is concerned with one platform only, and though it deals with the 
Macintosh platform at more length than thealt.comp.virus FAQ can be expected 
to, it is a great deal shorter. Nor is there the same degree of urgency about 
the Mac virus field, though the risk element may be somewhat underestimated in 
general, at present. This FAQ originated from a concern over the spread of 
macro viruses, a theme that is taken up below. Since questions about Macs and 
viruses tend to appear more often in the Mac groups thanalt.comp.virus or 
Virus-L, distribution of this FAQ is wider. 5.0 Where to get further 
information ===================================== 5.1 Computer Virus FAQs 
------------------------ Computer Virus FAQ for New Users A mainly non-Mac 
virus FAQ posted tonews.newusers.questions, alt.newbie, alt.newbies, alt.answers
, andnews.answers. &lt;http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-virus/new-users/&gt; 
alt.comp.virus FAQ This is posted to alt.comp.virus approximately fortnightly. 
It includes a document that summarizes and gives contact information for a 
number of other virus-related FAQs; (not much Mac-specific material). The 
latest version is available from: &lt;http://www.sherpasoft.org.uk/acvFAQ/&gt; 
but the reference version will eventually be the one at www.eicar.dk (page 
currently under construction). VIRUS-L/comp.virus FAQ The Virus-L/comp.virus 
FAQ (also fairly low on Mac-specific information) is regularly posted to the 
comp.virus newsgroup (version 2.0 at time of writing). This FAQ is very long 
and very thorough. The document is subject to revision, so the file name may 
change. The latest version may be found at: 
&lt;ftp://ftp.infospace.com/pub/virus-l/&gt; &lt;
ftp://ftp.datafellows.com/pub/misc/anti-vir/vlfaq200.zip&gt; 5.2 EICAR 
---------- ++Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit, Virex, and NAV (Norton AntiVirus 
for Macintosh) now support the EICAR test. This article by Paul Ducklin of 
Sophos explains the EICAR test file: &lt;
http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm&gt;. [SL] 5.3 &quot;Robert 
Slade's Guide to Computer Viruses&quot; 
----------------------------------------------- The disk included with the 2nd 
Edition of this excellent general resource includes most of the information 
available at the University of Hamburg (see 5.5). The book also contains a 
reasonable quantity of Mac-friendly information. The disk includes a copy of 
Disinfectant 3.6, which is now out-of-date -- 3.7.1 is the latest and final 
release. For more information about this book: 
&lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0387946632/&gt; [Springer] ++Very 
few books primarily about computer viruses deal at any length with Mac viruses 
(I can't think of one, at present). Some general books on the Mac touch on the 
subject, but none I can think of add anything useful. Some of the &quot;Totally 
Witless User's Guide to.......&quot; books dealing with security in general 
include information on PC -and- Mac viruses. Unfortunately, the quality of 
virus-related information in such publications is generally low, and there are 
few or no books on computer viruses in general which are both recent -and- 
accurate. 5.4 Web sites -------------- Many major vendors have a virus 
information database online on their Web sites. Symantec (www.symantec.com), 
Network Associates (www.nai.com), Sophos (www.sophos.com) and Dr. Solomon's 
(www.drsolomon.com) include Macintosh virus information. Precise URLs tend to 
come and go, but you might like to try the following: Symantec Antivirus 
Research Center Virus Encyclopedia based on Project VGrep: huge, and now has a 
search engine. Probably the most complete [SL]. But not always the most 
accurate [DH]. ;-) &lt;http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/vinfodb.html&gt;

watching &lt;www.icsa.org&gt; 5.5 Virus Bulletin ------------------- The 
expensive (but, for the professional, essential) periodical Virus Bulletin 
includes Mac-specific information from time to time. However, if you have no 
interest in PC issues, you probably won't consider it worth the expense. Virus 
Bulletin Ltd The Pentagon Abingdon OX14 3YP England +44 1235 555139 &lt;
http://www.virusbtn.com/&gt; The proceedings of the 1997 Virus Bulletin 
conference contained a paper by David Harley which significantly expands on 
many of the issues addressed in this FAQ. Contact Virus Bulletin for further 
information on the annual conference and on obtaining the proceedings. The 
paper can also be found (by permission of Virus Bulletin) at the author's 
website &lt;http://www.sherpasoft.org.uk/MacSupporters/&gt; and at &lt;
http://www.icsa.net/&gt; 5.6 Macro virus information resources 
-------------------------------------- ++University of Hamburg Virus Test 
Center Macro Virus List is the definitive listing. All known macro viruses, 
some only found in research labs, some in the wild. Doesn't include information 
on individual viruses apart from name and platform, and somewhat irregularly 
maintained. &lt;ftp://agn-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/pub/texts/macro/&gt;

an FAQ on the subject of Word viruses. It's well out-of-date, though, and was 
always inaccurate in some respects.

Other resources -------------------- There are excellent pages on HyperCard 
viruses at HyperActive Software. There is information on HyperCard infectors, a 
link to Bill Swagerty's free Vaccine utility for detecting and cleaning them, a 
note on false positives reported by commercial software, inoculation, and a 
free HyperCard virus detection service. &lt;
http://www.hyperactivesw.com/Virus1.html&gt; The CIAC virus database includes 
entries for PC, Macintosh, and a number of other platforms. The Macintosh 
section also includes a number of joke programs and one or two apparent hoaxes.

&lt;ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/vir/&gt; 6.0 How many viruses affect the 
Macintosh? =========================================== There are around 40 
Mac-specific viruses and related threats. ++Mac users with Word 6 or versions 
of Word/Excel supporting Visual Basic for Applications, however, are vulnerable 
to infection by macro viruses which are specific to these applications. Indeed, 
these viruses can, potentially, infect other files on any hardware platform 
supporting these versions of these applications. I don't know of a macro virus 
with a Mac-specific payload that actually works at present, but such a payload 
is entirely possible. ++Office 98 applications are in principle vulnerable to 
most of the threats to which Office 97 applications are vulnerable. I'll return 
to this subject when and if time allows. [DH] Word Mac version 5.1 and below do 
not support WordBasic, and are not, therefore, vulnerable to direct infection. 
Not only do these versions not only understand embedded macros, but they can't 
read the Word 6 file format unaided. There is, however, at least one freeware 
utility which allows Word 5.x users to read Word 6 files. This will not support 
execution of Word 6 (or WinWord 2) macros in Word 5.x, so I would not expect 
either an infection routine or a payload routine to be able to execute within 
this application. However, Word 5.x users may contribute indirectly to the 
spread of infected files across platforms and systems, since it is perfectly 
possible for a user whose own system is uninfectable to act as a conduit for 
the transmission of infected documents, whether or not s/he reads it 
personally. Files infected with a PC-specific file virus (this excludes macro 
viruses) can only execute on a Macintosh running DOS or DOS/Windows emulation, 
if then. They can, of course, spread across platforms simply by copying 
infected files from one system to another. DOS diskettes infected with a boot 
sector virus can be read on a Mac with Apple File Exchange, PC Exchange, DOS 
Mounter etc. without (normally) risk to the Mac. However, leaving such an 
infected disk in the drive while booting an emulator such as SoftPC can mean 
that the virus attempts to infect the logical PC drive with unpredictable 
results. I am aware of at least one instance of a Mac diskette which, when read 
on a PC running a utility for reading Mac-formatted disks after being infected 
with a boot-sector infector, became unreadable as a consequence of the boot 
track infection. Some Mac viruses may damage files on Sun systems running MAE 
or AUFS. 7.0 What viruses can affect Mac users? 
======================================= Not all variants are listed here. It 
was originally intended to reference all the major variants at least by name 
eventually, but since the information is of academic interest at best to most 
users (and available elsewhere anyway), it's no longer considered a priority. 
The main problem affecting Mac users nowadays is the spread of macro viruses, 
and I can't possibly find time to catalogue them individually, so they are only 
considered generally. Native Mac viruses are rather rarely seen nowadays, and 
most people don't need to know about them in detail -- in fact, what they need 
most is to know that their favoured antivirus software will deal with them. 
Note that I'm not primarily in the business of hands-on virus analysis, and 
cannot accept responsibility for descriptive errors based on third-party 
information. [DH] The following varieties are listed below: 7.1 Mac-specific 
system and file infectors 7.2 HyperCard Infectors 7.3 Mac Trojans 7.4 Macro 
viruses, trojans, variants 7.5 Other Operating Systems, emulation on a Mac 7.6 
AutoStart 9805 Worms 7.7 Esperanto 4733 7.1 Mac-specific system and file 
infectors ------------------------------------------- AIDS - infects 
application and system files. No intentional damage. (nVIR B strain) Aladin - 
close relative of Frankie Anti (Anti-A/Anti-Ange, Anti-B, Anti Variant) - can't 
spread under system 7.x, or System 6 under MultiFinder. Can damage applications 
so that they can't be 100% repaired. CDEF - infects desktop files. No 
intentional damage, and doesn't spread under system 7.x. CLAP: nVIR variant 
that spoofs Disinfectant to avoid detection (Disinfectant 3.6 recognizes it). 
Code 1: file infector. Renames the hard drive to &quot;Trent Saburo&quot;. 
Accidental system crashes possible. Code 252: infects application and system 
files. Triggers when run between June 6th and December 31st. Runs a gotcha 
message (&quot;You have a virus. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Now erasing all disks... 
[etc.]&quot;), then self-deletes. Despite the message, no intentional damage is 
done, though shutting down the Mac instead of clicking to continue could cause 
damage. Can crash System 7 or damage files, but doesn't spread beyond the 
System file. Doesn't spread under System 6 with MultiFinder beyond System and 
MultiFinder. Can cause various forms of accidental damage. Code 9811: hides 
applications, replacing them with garbage files named &quot;something like 
'FIDVCXWGJKJWLOI'.&quot; According to Ken Dunham who reported this virus in 
November, &quot;The most obvious symptom of the virus is a desktop that looks 
like electronic worms and a message that reads 'You have been hacked by the 
Pretorians.'&quot; Code 32767: once a month tries to delete documents. This 
virus is not known to be in circulation. Flag: unrelated to WDEF A and B, but 
was given the name WDEF-C in some anti-virus software. Not intentionally 
damaging but when spreading it overwrites any existing 'WDEF' resource of ID 
'0', an action which might damage some files. This virus is not known to be in 
circulation. Frankie: only affects the Aladdin emulator on the Atari or Amiga. 
Doesn't infect or trigger on real Macs or the Spectre emulator. Infects 
application files and the Finder. Draws a bomb icon and displays 'Frankie says: 
No more piracy!&quot; Fuck: infects application and System files. No 
intentional damage. (nVIR B strain) Init 17: infects System file and 
applications. Displays message &quot;From the depths of Cyberspace&quot; the 
first time it triggers. Accidental damage, especially on 68K machines. Init 29 
(Init 29 A, B): Spreads rapidly. Infects system files, applications, and 
document files (document files can't infect other files, though). May display a 
message if a locked floppy is accessed on an infected system 'The disk 
&quot;xxxxx&quot; needs minor repairs. Do you want to repair it?'. No 
intentional damage, but can cause several problems - Multiple infections, 
memory errors, system crashes, printing problems, MultiFinder problems, startup 
document incompatibilities. Init 1984: Infects system extensions (INITs). Works 
under Systems 6 and 7. Triggers on Friday 13th. Damages files by renaming them, 
changing file TYPE and file CREATOR, creation and modification dates, and 
sometimes by deleting them. Init-9403 (SysX): Infects applications and Finder 
under systems 6 and 7. Attempts to overwrite whole startup volume and disk 
information on all connected hard drives. Only found on Macs running the 
Italian version of MacOS. Init-M: Replicates under System 7 only. Infects INITs 
and application files. Triggers on Friday 13th. Similar damage mechanisms to 
INIT-1984. May rename a file or folder to &quot;Virus MindCrime&quot;. Rarely, 
may delete files. MacMag (Aldus, Brandow, Drew, Peace): first distributed as a 
HyperCard stack Trojan, but only infected System files. Triggered (displayed a 
peace message and self-deleted on March 2nd 1988, so very rarely found. MBDF 
(A,B): originated from the Tetracycle, Tetricycle or 
&quot;tetris-rotating&quot; Trojan. The A strain was also distributed in 
Obnoxious Tetris and Ten Tile Puzzle. Infect applications and system files 
including System and Finder. Can cause accidental damage to the System file and 
menu problems. A minor variant of MBDF B appeared in summer 1997: Disinfectant 
and Virex have been updated accordingly. MDEF (MDEF A/Garfield, MDEF B/Top Cat, 
C, D): infect System file and application files (D doesn't infect System). No 
intentional damage, but can cause crashes and damaged files. MDEF-E and MDEF-F: 
described as simple and benign. They infect applications and system files with 
an 'MDEF' resource ID '0', not otherwise causing file damage. These viruses are 
not known to be in circulation. nCAM: nVIR variant nVIR (nVIR A, B, C - AIDS, 
Fuck, Hpat, Jude, MEV#, nFlu): infect System and any opened applications. 
Extant versions don't cause intentional damage. Payload is either beeping or 
(nVIR A) saying &quot;Don't panic&quot; if MacInTalk is installed. nVIR-f: nVIR 
variant. prod: nVIR variant Scores (Eric, Vult, NASA, San Jose Flu): aimed to 
attack two applications that were never generally released. Can cause 
accidental damage, though - system crashes, problems printing or with MacDraw 
and Excel. Infects applications, Finder, DA Handler. SevenDust-A through G 
(MDEF 9806-A through D, also known as 666, E was at first called &quot;Graphics 
Accelerator&quot;): a family of five viruses which spread both through 'MDEF' 
resources and a System extension created by that resource. The first four 
variants are not known to be in circulation. Two of these viruses cause no 
other damage. On the sixth day of the month, MDEF 9806-B may erase all 
non-application files on the current volume. The SARC encyclopedia calls MDEF 
9806-C, &quot;polymorphic and encrypted, no payload,&quot; and MDEF 9806-D, 
&quot;encrypting, polymorphic, symbiotic,&quot; and says the symbiotic part, 
&quot;alters a 'WIND' resource from the host application.&quot; SevenDust E, 
not to be confused with the legitimate ATI driver &quot;Graphics 
Accelerator&quot;, began as a trojan horse released to Info-Mac and deleted 
there on or about September 26, 1998. Takes two forms, 'INIT' resource ID '33' 
in an extension named &quot;\001Graphics Accelerator&quot; and an 'MDEF' 
resource ID '1' to '255'. Between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on the sixth and 
twelfth day of any month, the virus will try to delete all non-application 
files on the startup disk. John Dalgliesh describes &quot;Graphics 
Accelerator&quot; on his Web page for AntiGax, a free anti-SevenDust E utility; 
any errors here in translation are not his. SevenDust F uses a trojan 
&quot;ExtensionConflict&quot;, common extensions names, and creator 'ACCE'.[SL] 
T4 (A, B, C, D): infects applications, Finder, and tries to modify System so 
that startup code is altered. Under System 6 and 7.0, INITs and system 
extensions don't load. Under 7.0.1, the Mac may be unbootable. Damage to 
infected files and altered System is not repairable by Disinfectant. The virus 
masquerades as Disinfectant, so as to spoof behaviour blockers such as 
Gatekeeper. Originally included in versions 2.0/2.1 of the public domain game 
GoMoku. T4-D spreads from application to application on launch by appending 
itself to the 'CODE' resource. Deletes files other than the System file from 
the System Folder, and documents, and is termed dangerous. The D strain is not 
known to be in circulation [SL]. WDEF (A,B): infects desktop file only. Doesn't 
spread under System 7. No intentional damage, but causes beeping, crashes, font 
corruption and other problems. zero: nVIR variant. Zuc (A, B, C): infects 
applications. The cursor moves diagonally and uncontrollably across the screen 
when the mouse button is held down when an infected application is run. No 
other intentional damage is done. 7.2 HyperCard infectors 
------------------------ These are a somewhat esoteric breed, but a couple have 
been seen since Disinfectant was last upgraded in 1995, and most of the 
commercial scanners detect them. Dukakis - infects the Home stack, then other 
stacks used subsequently. Displays the message &quot;Dukakis for 
President&quot;, then deletes itself, so not often seen. HC 9507 - infects the 
Home stack, then other running stacks and randomly chosen stacks on the startup 
disk. On triggering, displays visual effects or hangs the system. Overwrites 
stack resources, so a repaired stack may not run properly. HC 9603 - infects 
the Home stack, then other running stacks. No intended effects, but may damage 
the Home stack. HC &quot;Two Tunes&quot; (referred to by some sources as 
&quot;Three Tunes&quot;) - infects stack scripts. Visual/Audio effects: 'Hey, 
what are you doing?' message; plays the tune &quot;Muss I denn&quot;; plays the 
tune &quot;Behind the Blue Mountains&quot;; displays HyperCard toolbox and 
pattern menus; displays 'Don't panic!' fifteen minutes after activation. Even 
sources which describe this virus as &quot;Three Tunes&quot; seem to describe 
the symptoms consistently with the description here, but we will, for 
completeness, attempt to resolve any possible confusion when time allows. This 
virus has no known with the PC file infector sometimes known as Three Tunes. 
MerryXmas - appends to stack script. On execution, attempts to infect the Home 
stack, which then infects other stacks on access. There are several strains, 
most of which cause system crashes and other anomalies. At least one strain 
replaces the Home stack script and deletes stacks run subsequently. Variants 
include Merry2Xmas, Lopez, and the rather destructive Crudshot. [Ken Dunham 
discovered the merryXmas virus. His program merryxmasWatcher 2.0 was very 
popular and still can eradicate the most common two strains, merryXmas and 
merry2Xmas. merryxmasWatcher 2.0 is outdated for the rest this family.] 
Antibody is a recent virus-hunting virus which propagates between stacks 
checking for and removing MerryXmas, and inserting an inoculation script. 
Independance (sic) Day - reported in July, 1997. It attempts to to be 
destructive, but fortunately is not well enough written to be more than a 
nuisance. More information at: &lt;http://www.hyperactivesw.com/Virus1.html#IDay
&gt; Blink - reported in August, 1998. Nondestructive but spreads; infected 
stacks blink once per second starting in January, 1999. 7.3 Mac Trojan Horses 
---------------------- These are often unsubtle and immediate in their effects: 
while these effects may be devastating, Trojans are usually very traceable to 
their point of entry. The few Mac-specific Trojans are rarely seen, but of 
course the commercial scanners generally detect them. ChinaTalk - system 
extension - supposed to be sound driver, but actually deletes folders. CPro - 
supposed to be an update to Compact Pro, but attempts to format currently 
mounted disks. + ExtensionConflict - supposed to identify Extensions conflicts, 
but installs one of the six SevenDust a.k.a. 666 viruses. FontFinder - supposed 
to lists fonts used in a document, but actually deletes folders. MacMag - 
HyperCard stack (New Apple Products) that was the origin of the MacMag virus. 
When run, infected the System file, which then infected System files on 
floppies. Set to trigger and self-destruct on March 2nd, 1988, so rarely found. 
Mosaic - supposed to display graphics, but actually mangles directory 
structures. NVP - modifies the System file so that no vowels can be typed. 
Originally found masquerading as 'New Look', which redesigns the display. 
Steroid - Control Panel - claims to improve QuickDraw speed, but actually 
mangles the directory structure. Tetracycle - implicated in the original spread 
of MBDF Virus Info - purported to contain virus information but actually 
trashed disks. Not to be confused with Virus Reference. Virus Reference 2.1.6 
mentions an 'Unnamed PostScript hack' which disables PostScript printers and 
requires replacement of a chip on the printer logic board to repair. A Mac 
virus guru says: &quot;The PostScript 'Trojan' was basically a PostScript job 
that toggled the printer password to some random string a number of times. Some 
Apple laser printers have a firmware counter that allows the password to only 
be changed a set number of times (because of PRAM behavior or licensing -- I 
don't remember which), so eventually the password would get &quot;stuck&quot; 
at some random string that the user would not know. I have not heard any 
reports of anyone suffering from this in many years.&quot; AppleScript Trojans 
- A demonstration destructive compiled AppleScript was posted to the newsgroups
alt.comp.virus, comp.sys.mac.misc, comp.sys.mac.system, it.comp.macintosh, 
microsoft.public.word.mac, nl.comp.sys.mac, no.mac, and 
symantec.support.mac.sam.general on 16-Aug-97, apparently in response to a call 
for help originally posted toalt.comp.virus on 14-Aug-97 and followup on 
15-Aug-97. On 03-Sep-97, MacInTouch published Xavier Bury's finding of a second 
AppleScript trojan horse, which, like the call for help followup, mentioned 
Hotline servers. It reportedly sends out private information while running in 
the background. A note to users from Hotline Communications CEO Adam Hinkley is 
posted at &lt;http://www.macvirus.com/news/press/970903a.html&gt;. AppleScripts 
should be downloaded only from known trusted sources. It is nigh impossible for 
an average person to know what any given compiled script will do. 7.4 Macro 
viruses, trojans, variants ------------------------------------- At the time of 
the longstanding second-to-last upgrade of Disinfectant (version 3.6 in early 
1995), there were no known macro viruses in the wild, apart from HyperCard 
infectors. In any case, Disinfectant was always intended to deal with system 
viruses, not trojans or macro/script viruses. However, many users are unaware 
of these distinctions and still assume that Disinfectant is a complete 
solution, even after its effective demise (in fact, there were people still 
relying on Gatekeeper long after its author disowned it....). Unfortunately, 
the number of known macro viruses runs into several thousand, though the number 
in the wild is far fewer. Most macro viruses (if they have a warhead at all) 
target Intel platforms and assume FAT-based directory structures, so they 
usually have no discernible effect on Macs when they trigger. Viruses that 
manipulate text strings within a document may work just as well on a Macintosh 
as on a PC. In any case, the main costs of virus control are not recovery from 
virus payloads, but the costs of establishing detection and protection (or of 
not establishing them). The costs of not establishing these measures can be 
considerable, irrespective of damage caused on infected machines, especially in 
corporate environments. Secondary distribution of infected documents may result 
in: * civil action - for instance, inadvertent distribution of an infected 
document to external organisations may be in breach of contractual obligations 
* legal action in terms of breach of data-protection legislation such as the UK 
Data Protection Act or the European Data Protection directive. The eighth 
principle of the Data Protection Act, for instance, requires that security 
measures are taken to protect against unauthorised access to, and alteration, 
disclosure and destruction of personal data, or its accidental loss. * damage 
to reputation - no legitimate organisation wants to be seen as being riddled 
with viruses. Since Word 6.x for Macintosh supports WordBasic macros, it is as 
vulnerable as Word 6.x and 7.x on Intel platforms to being infected by macro 
viruses, and therefore to generating other infected documents (or, strictly 
speaking, templates). Working Excel viruses are now beginning to appear also, 
and any future Macintosh application that supports Visual Basic for 
Applications will also be vulnerable. Note also that the possibility of 
virus-infected files embedded as objects in files associated with other 
applications: this possibility exists on any platform that supports OLE. 
++Office 98 is in general vulnerable to infection by most viruses which affect 
corresponding applications in Office 97. Macro viruses are therefore highly 
transmissible via Macintoshes, even if they don't have a destructive effect on 
Motorola platforms, if there is an equivalent application available on the 
Macintosh. For instance, although Word for Windows versions before vs. 6 
support WordBasic, Word versions for the Mac up to and including version 5.1 do 
not. [Thus Word 5.1 users can not be directly infected, but may, like anyone, 
pass on infected documents to vulnerable systems.]] Network Associates, 
Symantec, and Intego all make known-virus scanners that detect a range of macro 
viruses. Microsoft make available a free 'protection tool' whose effectiveness 
is often overestimated. (See below.) ++[I'm no longer able to find any 
reference on Intego's site to Rival: their efforts seems to be focused on their 
personal firewall for Macintosh.] For further information on specific macro 
viruses, try one of the information resources given earlier. 7.5 Other 
Operating Systems, emulation on a Mac 
------------------------------------------------ Any Mac running any sort of 
DOS or Windows emulation such as Virtual PC, SoftPC, SoftWindows, RealPC, or a 
DOS compatibility card is a potential target for any PC virus, including Boot 
Sector Infectors/Multipartites; (effects will vary). It is highly recommended 
that anyone with such a system should run a reputable, up-to-date PC antivirus 
program under emulation, as well as a good Mac antivirus program. [Dr. 
Solomon's for the Mac detected PC boot sector infectors as well as Mac viruses, 
but didn't detect PC file viruses (apart from macro viruses), and so was not 
sufficient protection for a Mac with DOS emulation.] Recommendations for 
defending PC systems or PC emulation on Macs are slightly out-of-scope for this 
FAQ. In fact, I don't know of any formal testing for PC antivirus software in 
the context of PC emulation on Macs. I've done some informal testing (referred 
to in another paper), but am not prepared to make vendor-specific 
recommendations on the basis of such testing. F-Prot, AVP, and Dr Solomon's are 
particularly well-regarded PC antivirus packages, of which some components on 
some platforms are available as freeware or for evaluation, but their efficacy 
in the context of PC emulation is not well tested or documented. To find a 
commercial or shareware package relevant to PCs, check through the independent 
comparative reviews sites: University of Hamburg Virus Test Center &lt;

reviews links. &lt;http://antivirus.about.com/msub12.htm&gt; Robert Michael

http://www.freenet.victoria.bc.ca/techrev/rms.html&gt; 7.6 AutoStart 9805 Worms 
------------------------- AutoStart 9805 is not a virus, but a worm: that is, 
it replicates by copying itself, but doesn't attach itself parasitically to a 
host program. The original took hold rapidly in Hong Kong and Taiwan in April 
1998, and has been reported on at least four continents. In addition to the 
original worm, there are five variants. Virus Bulletin, July, 1998, includes a 
comprehensive analysis of AutoStart and some of its variants. CIAC Bulletin 
I-067 is based on Eugene Spafford's information release on the original 
AutoStart worm. Unfortunately,this is now a little out-of-date, particularly as 
regards the update status of the antivirus software it mentions. Nor does it 
mention any of the subsequently discovered variants. &lt;http://www.ciac.org/
&gt; Symptoms: Perhaps the most noticeable symptom of the worms is that an 
infected system will _lock up and churn with unexplained disk activity_ every 
6, 10, or 30 minutes.[SL] Affected platforms: any PowerMac. Macintoshes and 
clones driven by Motorola 680x0 series CPUs can't run the replicative code. It 
works under any version of Mac OS, if QuickTime 2.0 or later is installed and 
CD-ROM AutoPlay is enabled in the &quot;QuickTime Settings&quot; Control Panel. 
Transmission media: HFS or HFS+ volumes (hard disks, diskettes, most types of 
removable media, even disk images). Audio CDs can't transmit the virus, and it 
isn't necessary to disable &quot;Audio CD AutoPlay&quot;. Transmission method: 
infected media contain an invisible application file named &quot;DB&quot; or 
&quot;BD&quot; or &quot;DELDB&quot; in the root directory (type APPL, creator 
????). This is an AutoStart file: i.e. it will run automatically if CD-ROM 
autoplay is enabled. If the host Mac isn't already infected, it copies itself 
to the Extensions folder. The new copy is renamed &quot;Desktop Print 
Spooler&quot; or &quot;Desktop Printr Spooler&quot;, or &quot;DELDesktop Print 
Spooler&quot; respectively (type appe, creator ????). Unlike the legitimate 
Desktop Printer Spooler extension, the worm file has the invisible attribute 
set, and isn't listed as a running process by the system software, though it 
can be seen with Process Watcher or Macsbug. After copying itself, it reboots 
the system and is now launched every time the system restarts. At approximately 
6, 10, or 30 minute intervals, it examines mounted volumes to see if they're 
infected: if not, it writes itself to the root directory and sets up AutoStart 
(however, AutoStart won't work on a server volume). Damage: files with names 
ending &quot;data&quot;, &quot;cod&quot; or &quot;csa&quot; are targeted if the 
data fork is larger than 100 bytes. Files with names ending &quot;dat&quot; are 
targeted if the whole file is c. 2Mb or larger. Targeted files are attacked by 
overwriting the data fork (up to the 1st Mb) with garbage. Besides the 
original, there are five variants: AutoStart 9805-B, which is less noticeable 
but can cause irreparable damage to files of type 'JPEG', 'TIFF', and 'EPSF'; 
AutoStart 9805-C and AutoStart 9805-D which do not intentionally damage data; 
AutoStart 9805-E which spreads like B and is most similar to the original; and 
AutoStart 9805-F which is most similar to A and E. Dr Solomon's, Sophos, and 
Symantec had descriptions on the Web: 
&lt;http://www.drsolomon.com/vircen/valerts/mac/&gt; 
&lt;http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/autostart9805.html&gt; &lt;
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/data/autostart.9805.html&gt; ++Dead Mac Virus 
link cleaned. Detection: updates to deal with the worms are available for Virex 
(http://www.drsolomon.com/products/virex/), for NAV and SAM (
http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/download.html), and for Rival 
(http://www.intego.com/). The last versions of VirusScan for Mac and 
Disinfectant did not detect AutoStart. [Reference to Dr Solomon's for Mac 
removed, as the product is no longer supported.] Prevention: uninfected systems 
can be protected by disabling the AutoStart option in QuickTime settings 
(QuickTime 2.5 or later only - earlier versions don't have a disable option). 
This should also prevent infection by future malware exploiting the same 
loophole, but will fail if a setup is booted from a volume with an infected 
Extensions Folder [SL]. Removal: the easiest and safest method for most people 
will be to use the updated version of their favoured anti-virus software, as it 
becomes available. The worms can be also be removed manually. * Reboot with 
extensions disabled (hold down the shift key till an alert box tells you that 
extensions are off). * Use Find File to search all volumes for all instances of 
a file called &quot;DB&quot; or &quot;BD&quot; or &quot;DELDB&quot; with the 
invisibility attribute set (hold down Option key when clicking on 
&quot;Name&quot; pop-up menu to select for visibility). Trash 'em. * Use Find 
File to find and trash an invisible &quot;Desktop Print Spooler&quot;, 
&quot;Desktop Printr Spooler&quot;, or &quot;DELDesktop Print Spooler&quot; 
file (-not- Desktop Printer Spooler, which is a legitimate and usually 
necessary system file). * Empty the trash. * Disable AutoStart in QuickTime 
Settings Control Panel. * Restart. 7.7 Esperanto.4733 ------------------- This 
probably doesn't belong here. It's a PC file infector which works with a number 
of PC executable file formats. When it was first seen, it was reported to be a 
multiplatform virus capable of executing under some circumstances on 
Macintoshes. Subsequent reports indicate that this belief results from 
misinformation on the part of the author. However, at least two reputable PC 
anti-virus vendors still list it as capable of activating on a Macintosh. No 
Mac scanner is known to attempt to detect it. 8.0 What's the best antivirus 
package for the Macintosh? 
========================================================= As ever, we can't 
give a definitive answer to this. The best choice depends on subjective 
criteria and individal needs. Nonetheless, Here are some thoughts on the main 
contenders. 8.1 Microsoft's Protection Tools --------------------------------- 
Microsoft's Macro Virus Protection Tools originally detected Concept (Nuclear 
and DMV were also mentioned in the documentation, but were not identified 
specifically by the tools). Principally, they merely warned users that the 
document they are about to open contained macros and offered the choice of 
opening the file without macros, opening it with macros, or cancelling the File 
Open. Later implementations built into the application are better on 
identifying a few specific viruses and on integration into Word itself, but 
should not be relied on for 100% effective detection, blocking and disinfection 
of macro viruses. More information from Microsoft may be available at the 
addresses below. &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/office/antivirus/&gt; (no longer 
accessible) MSN: GO MACROVIRUSTOOL AOL: the Word forum CompuServe: the Word 
forum Microsoft Product Support Services 206-462-9673 (WinWord) 206-635-7200 
(Word Mac) email:wordinfo@microsoft.com NB The Protection Tool traps some File 
Open operations, but not all. There are a number of ways of opening a document 
which bypass it, some of which are rather commonly used (e.g. double-clicking 
or using the Recent Documents list). The Protection Tool can be used to scan 
for Concept-infected files, but there are a number of possible problems with 
it. * Earlier versions could only handle a limited size of directory tree, and 
ran very slowly if a large number of files required scanning. Speed is 
certainly still a problem: I can't say about the overflow problem. * Files 
created in Word for Windows won't be scanned until they've been opened in Word 
6 for Mac (this is a system issue, not a bug in the code). However, Microsoft 
suggest that you open the file in Word for the Macintosh and save it before 
scanning. This will do the job, but will also infect your system, if the file 
is infected. If it's infected with a virus -other- than Concept, this could 
create problems if the Protection Tool is bypassed on a subsequent file open. * 
Infected files embedded in OLE2 files or e-mail files will not be detected. * 
The Microsoft tools are not useful on non-English Windows systems (which may be 
run under Virtual PC or Real PC). SCANPROT cannot handle non-English documents, 
and will hang during the scanning process if it encounters a document created 
with a non-English version of Word. Microsoft's Excel add-in for the Laroux 
macro virus causes multiple file open buttons to appear in non-English versions 
of Excel, and so it has worse effects than the macro virus itself. Again this 
applies to Windows emulation; however, most virus protection and detection 
products are only tested in an English language environment, and may cause 
problems on non-English systems. [Thanks to Eric Hildum for this information.] 
Windows 95 users should be aware that SCANPROT is not recommended for use with 
MS Word 7.0a for Windows with internal detection enabled, as these two tools 
will cancel each other out. The Excel add-in for Macs removes only Laroux A and 
B. &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/macoffice/laroux.htm&gt; ++Office 98 moves the 
goalposts again. This issue will probably be addressed again here in more 
depth. In brief, Office 98 does a better job of implementing a primarily 
generic approach [i.e. &quot;If it contains macros, it's suspicious: sort it 
out yourself....&quot;], but whether this is enough is a question demanding 
more space and time than I have to spare right now. Office 97/98 include 
limited detection of a handful of known viruses during upconversion of macros. 
This is poorly implemented and in any case is only triggered when macros are 
converted to VBA from WordBasic. Vesselin Bontchev has considered macro 
upconversion at some length in papers for Virus Bulletin and EICAR conferences. 
++Microsoft's home page has recommended using an ICSA-certified antivirus 
utility and sidesteps any hint of responsibility for any macro virus or 
SCANPROT related problems. However, ICSA does not currently certify Mac 
products, though this is being looked at. 8.2 Disinfectant ----------------- 
[On May 6th 1998, John Norstad, author of this widely-used freeware package 
announced that it was to be retired. 3.7.1 is the latest and last version, and 
it won't be updated to detect AutoStart 9805 or any subsequent Macintosh 
malware. The main reason for this is that he doesn't have the resources to 
extend its capabilities to detect macro viruses, which have become by far the 
most significant virus problem for most Macintosh users. This is probably a 
wise decision, given the number of people who still overestimate the 
effectiveness of the package in the face of the macro virus threat. However, 
the entire Macintosh community owes John Norstad a debt of gratitude for making 
it freely available for so long, an act of altruism which has probably 
contributed very significantly to the comparative rarity of native Macintosh 
viruses.] Disinfectant was an excellent anti-virus package with exemplary 
documentation, and didn't cost a penny: however, it didn't detect all the forms 
of malware that a commercial package usually does, including HyperCard 
infectors, most Trojans, jokes or macro viruses. Unlike some commercial 
packages, it didn't scan compressed files, either: compressed files had to be 
expanded before scanning. Self-extracting archives were probably best scanned 
before unpacking, then again when unpacked. Disinfectant has been available up 
to now from the following sources, but this may not continue to be the case.: 
&lt;ftp://ftp.acns.nwu.edu/pub/disinfectant/&gt; CompuServe GEnie America 
Online Calvacom Delphi BIX Info-Mac mirrors in the ../vir/ directory The 
Disinfectant README was updated to README-IMPORTANT on 6 May 1998, with the 
message, &quot;because of the widespread and dangerous Microsoft macro virus 
problem,&quot; &quot;...All Disinfectant users should switch...&quot; to 
another program. README-IMPORTANT was updated again on 11 October 1998, adding, 
&quot;In addition to the Autostart worm and the Microsoft macro viruses, 
several other new Mac viruses have appeared since Disinfectant's retirement in 
May. This makes it even more important that Disinfectant users switch...&quot; 
to one of the commercial products. &lt;ftp://ftp.nwu.edu/pub/disinfectant/&gt; 
There is a copy of the retirement announcement on the Web: 
&lt;http://charlotte.acns.nwu.edu/jln/d-retire.ssi&gt; 8.3 Demo Software 
------------------ Symantec has a 30-day fully-functioning trialware NAV 
(Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh). Update it with current definitions. &lt;
http://www.symantec.com/nav/fs_navmac5.html&gt; Network Associates has a 30-day 
fully-functioning evaluation version of Virex 5.9.1. The Virex trial includes 
the application, not the control panel. 
&lt;ftp://ftp.nai.com/pub/antivirus/mac/virex/&gt; Update the demo with current 
definitions: &lt;ftp://ftp.nai.com/pub/antivirus/datfiles/mac/virex/&gt;. 
Sophos also has a 30-day evaluation, also fully-functioning, which includes the 
SWEEP application. The demo supports both English and Japanese. &lt;
http://www.sophos.com/downloads/eval/savmac.html&gt; ++Intego has a 
limited-function French demo of Rival, &quot;miniRival.&quot; 
&lt;http://www.intego.com/demo.html&gt; [This seems to have disappeared, along 
with Rival itself - 11-12-99] Disinfector 1.0 is described by its author as 
shareware. However, it's strictly speaking a limited-runtime demo -- it stops 
functioning after 20 trial runs on one system. It's described as a beta 
release, but the author expects users to register it at a charge of $30 
[subsequently reduced to $15]: in return, they get a version which can be used 
an unlimited number of times. It only detects a handful of Mac system viruses 
which the author claims that commercial vendors have not detected, and have not 
been reported in the wild. In the early days of virus/antivirus technology, a 
number of utilities were made available which addressed only one or a few 
viruses, and a proliferation of free AutoStart worm detectors continues that 
honourable tradition. However, charging for this particular utility puts it 
into the same arena as the commercial scanners which detect a far wider range 
of threats and for which full support is available, an area in which it cannot 
at present compete. Disinfector was briefly available at Info-Mac, but has 
since been removed. ++[I suspect that this product has been removed from 
circulation, but haven't checked with the author. This section will probably be 
amended or removed in the next version of the FAQ, when I've checked.] There 
have also been a number of proposals since John Norstad announced the 
retirement of Disinfectant, suggesting that if the code was made public, it 
would be possible to maintain and further develop Disinfectant, possibly still 
as a freeware product. This is misguided, for a number of reasons. * It misses 
one of the main points of Norstad's announcement, which is to acknowledge the 
dangers of continuing to develop a scanner which detects only one class of 
virus, when so many people have laboured so long under the misapprehension that 
it was a complete solution. * Disinfectant -has- been developed further. 
VirusScan is based on Disinfectant technology (under licence), and NAI are in a 
much better position to develop it as commercial-grade software than a group of 
well-meaning individuals without the specialised skills and resources of a 
mainstream anti-virus development team. Indeed, it may be that the terms of 
that agreement would prevent Norstad from making the code public even if he 
wanted to (I doubt that he does....). * Making the code public, even to a 
limited circle, would increase the chances of its falling into irresponsible 
hands. In fact, the online documentation has long stated that the code for the 
detection engine is not available, though some of the interface code was. (I'm 
paraphrasing from memory: I may well check out exactly what it says for the 
next update of the FAQ.) * To think that a committee of well-intentioned 
amateurs (or a single ambitious amateur can develop Disinfectant to the same 
high standard that it achieved through its lifetime demonstrates a profound 
underestimation of the difficulties of maintaining (let alone creating) a 
first-class known-virus scanner. [DH] Curiously, the same fallacies have 
recently been been aired on a Unix virus discussion list. 8.4 Other 
freeware/shareware packages -------------------------------------- For other 
freeware\shareware Mac packages, try Info-Mac mirrors like: &lt;
ftp://ftp.ucs.ubc.ca/pub/mac/info-mac/vir/&gt; The University of Texas holds 
some older documentation on Mac viruses. 
&lt;http://wwwhost.ots.utexas.edu/mac/pub-mac-virus.html&gt; Tracker INIT and 
DelProtect INIT, both by Ioannis Galidakis, were first released on 19-Nov-98. 
Tracker is a behavior blocker something like the retired program GateKeeper. 
DelProtect protects against malicious file deletion. Tracker is now at version 
1.1. Scanner 1.1x also by Ioannis Galidakis was released 15-Jan-99, and is a 
free, generic, heuristic 68k virus scanner for advanced Macintosh users. &lt;
http://www.crosswinds.net/athens/~jgal/&gt; John Dalgliesh has created Agax, an 
extensible, free anti-virus program which replaces his program AntiGax, and 
uses plug-ins called &quot;Additives.&quot; At this time, Agax will detect and 
try to clean only SevenDust, CODE 9811, and the AutoStart worms (the worm 
additive was in beta testing at the time of this writing). The author's Web 
page and documentation invite Mac programmers to contribute additives. &lt;
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2191331/agax/agax.html&gt; The Exorcist, free from 
Laffey Computer Imaging, may give some (by one description, about 90%) 
protection from the SevenDust family. &lt;
http://www.laffeycomputer.com/software.html&gt; Gatekeeper was not a scanner, 
but a generic tool. It is no longer supported by its author, but is still 
available on some sites. It is probably not safe to use or rely on on modern 
systems, and I believe the author recommends that people don't attempt to use 
it, though I've been unable to contact him to get confirmation. In January 1997 
Padgett Peterson, author of the PC utility DiskSecure, released the first 
version of his MacroList macro detection tool, which has been tested by the 
author on Macs (System 7.5 on SE/30, IIci and PowerMac) as well as Windows PCs, 
using considerably more macro viruses than Microsoft seem to have heard of..... 
The MacroList template is accessed by a button in the standard toolbar. This is 
not a virus scanner, but allows disabling of automacros, listing of any macros 
found in the current document etc. Version 1.10 was due for release by the time 
of writing (February 1997), and an adaptation for Office97 is in progress. 
Watch the Web page for further details. [v1.1 and the Office 97 &quot;late 
beta&quot; were available as at 18th March 1997.] MacroList is freeware, but

is a free on-access extension that affords AutoStart worm protection: &lt;
http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/NewSearch?key=WormGuard&gt; The 
following free scanners may remove AutoStart 9805 and its B, C, D, E, and F 
variants and may be useful in the absence of a commercial application. There 
are a few reported instances of failures by some of these programs to identify 
or remove the AutoStart worms, and it is likely that D might be mis-identified 
as C, and E may be mis-identified as the original worm. [SL] WormScanner by

with update, by Uptown Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://www.uptown.com/&gt; As stated 
above, one-shot solutions to a very small subset of a particular class of 
threat have a long and honourable history, and are very welcome when a new 
threat catches the antivirus developers on the hop (it can take some time to 
incorporate detection of new threats into the product update cycle). NB The 
maintainer does not currently have the time or resources to do full detection 
testing of these products (or any other). [DH] 8.5 Commercial Packages 
------------------------ Commercial packages include NAV (Norton AntiVirus for 
Macintosh) [NAV supersedes SAM (Symantec Antivirus for Macintosh)], Virex for 
Macintosh, Rival, and Sophos Anti-Virus for Macintosh (SAV). Virex, NAV, and 
SAM [obsolete] all address a full range of threats, including Trojans and macro 
viruses, and can do scheduled scanning as well as on-access (memory-resident) 
scanning. ++Sophos Anti-Virus for Macintosh (SAV) was upgraded in January 1999 
to include the SWEEP on-demand scanner. The shipping version can be downloaded 
for free evaluation. English and Japanese are supported. &lt;
http://www.sophos.com/downloads/eval/&gt; Stand-alone on-access scanning is now 
available in the release version. Server-based on-access scanning has long been 
available for Mac clients on NT or NetWare networks. The program offers 
customizable reporting and notification from an attractive interface. So far, 
compressed archives must be decompressed before scanning; I am assured that 
archive scanning will be in future versions. Complete documentation is in PDF 
format. &lt;http://www.sophos.com/support/docs/&gt; + Sophos combines an 
intercept driver (InterCheck) and a scanner application (SWEEP). Sales are not 
retail, but direct or through the Sophos Distributor network. Free technical 
support is all-year round, any time of day. Virus identity updates are 
available from the Web between monthly CD-ROMs. Major developments in the 
Sophos product are expected, including smooth large-scale deployment and ease 
of updating over networks.[SL] [This section is overdue for serious 
refurbishment. Next FAQ release, maybe. There may be an issue with the Sophos 
control panel and some USB drives - not formally tested to date.] Norton 
AntiVirus for Macintosh (NAV) launched May 18, 1998. New features included 
LiveUpdate virus definition updates over the Internet, enhanced macro virus 
protection, automatic file repair, a bootable CD-ROM for emergencies, faster 
scanning for PPC, and a universal SafeZone. NAV, SAM, and Virex offer 
checksumming/integrity checking (detecting possible infection by unknown 
viruses, by monitoring changes in infectable files) - the correct checksums or 
fingerprints for individual files are kept in a database file. All three 
applications check files compressed with StuffIt. NAV, formerly SAM, is 
particularly oriented towards behaviour blocking: the Intercept tool can be 
configured to raise an alert at the slightest whiff of a 'suspicious' 
operation. Unfortunately, this can be counterproductive in real life, since an 
over-stringent alert policy is apt to result in the facility being turned off 
altogether. However, configuration is very flexible. SAM (Symantec AntiVirus 
for Macintosh) support was discontinued May 1; the last update is for July '99. 
From Symantec's advice: &quot;In order to maintain the safety and security of 
your data from viruses without interruption, we recommend that you upgrade to 
NAVM 5.0.3 before May 1st. For presales and upgrade questions, please contact 
customer service. They can be reached at 800-441-7234 or online at:&quot; &lt;
http://www.symantec.com/custserv/&gt; [SAM 4.5.x needs the 4.5-&gt;4.5.1 
application patch to run current definitions, and the 4.5.3 Intercept patch to 
resolve a compatibility issue with Microsoft Office 98, and Segment Loader 
errors when Intercept loads. &lt;http://service.symantec.com/sam/&gt; 
&lt;http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/num.nsf/docid/19978714255&gt; SAM 
application Minimum and Preferred memory allocations must be increased from 
their shipping defaults to 5000K or greater. The (May 1998) SAM definitions 
files included a Read Me with instructions. More information may be available 
from Symantec SAM support on the Web.] Symantec issued a Norton AntiVirus 
5.x-&gt;5.0.3 patch for Mac OS 8.5, fixing the problem with copying files on 
AppleShare networks. &lt;http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/files/navm/ 
norton_antivirus_for_macintosh.html&gt; Virex offers very fast scanning is easy 
to update, and includes checksumming for the detection of unknown viruses. It's 
also possible to buy an administration package. The basic package includes a 
control panel for scanning on file or diskette access which can be locked 
independently of the administration package. Installation and interface are 
easy and efficient. Virex 5.8 scans ZIP archives, has a contextual menu plug-in 
module, and interface enhancements. Virex 5.9.1 was released on 18-Jan-99, for 
compatibility with Mac OS 8.5 and Virex Administrator 1.4, and can be 
downloaded. &lt;http://www.drsolomon.com/download/home/&gt;. Registered users 
who bought McAfee VirusScan during the past six months or so, and registered 
users of Virex 5.8 and 5.9 could still upgrade: &lt;
http://www.nai.com/products/antivirus/virex_mac.asp&gt;. Virex Administrator 
version 1.4 was released by NAI on 23-Dec-98. Virex and Virex Administrator had 
these home pages: &lt;http://www.drsolomon.com/products/virex/index.cfm&gt; 
&lt;http://www.drsolomon.com/products/vadmin/index.cfm&gt; ++Current Virex 
release is 6.0. Licensed 5.9x users can obtain an upgrade. OS 9 users will need 
the beta control panel available from www.nai.com, to overcome compatibility 
problems. Dr Solomon's Software acquired Virex and netOctopus from Datawatch 
Corp. on 10-Oct-97. Network Associates (NAI) acquired Dr Solomon's on 
13-Aug-98. Netopia, Inc., acquired what is now named Timbuktu netOctopus in 
late '98 or early '99. ++VirusScan 3.0.1 is the final version for Macintosh, 
and may be updated for macro viruses into 1999, but will never have AutoStart 
worm definitions or definitions for the new System viruses like SevenDust E. 
VirusScan customers need to take advantage of a free upgrade to Virex as soon 
as possible. Dr. Solomon's for Macintosh went through various stages of neglect 
through late 1998 and support appears to have vanished altogether in 1999, when 
customers started to receive Virex disks instead of Dr. Solly's updates. 
++Rival 3.0.4 is available from Intego. [Probably obsolete info.] 
&lt;http://www.intego.com/&gt; ++F-Secure for Macintosh is one of the best-kept 
secrets in anti-virus. The last time I saw it, it detected macro viruses only. 
You might be lucky and find some reference to it at: &lt;
http://www.datafellows.com&gt; It features on datafellows evaluation CDs. 8.6

http://www.sophos.com/ ++Details on DataFellows will be included when I've 
determined the current status of F-Secure for Macintosh. [Sorry: next time 
round, guys....] 9.0 Welcome Datacomp ===================== From time to time 
there are reports from Mac users that the message 'Welcome Datacomp' appears in 
their documents without having been typed. This is the result of using a 
Trojanised 3rd-party Mac-compatible keyboard with this 'joke' hard-coded into 
the keyboard ROM. It's not a virus - it cannot infect anything. The only cure 
is to replace the keyboard (be polite but firm with the dealer if you were sold 
this as a new keyboard!). 10.0 Hoaxes and myths ====================== Some of 
these are PC-specific, rather than Mac-specific, while some have no basis in 
reality on any system. [I look forward to hearing about the first Turing 
machine infector....] They are included here (a) because Mac support staff are 
accustomed to being asked about them (b) because anything that -might- work on 
a real PC -might- also work with DOS emulation, in principle. ++This section 
may vanish in the near future, or at least contract. The hoax business has 
changed a lot since this FAQ began. 10.1 Good Times virus 
---------------------- There is *no* Good Times virus that trashes your hard 
disk and launches your CPU into an nth-complexity binary loop when you read 
mail with &quot;Good Times&quot; in the Subject: field. You can get a copy of 
the latest version of Les Jones' FAQ on the Good Times Hoax on the World Wide 
Web: &lt;http://www.public.usit.net/lesjones/goodtimes.html&gt; There's a 
Mini-FAQ available as: &lt;http://www.public.usit.net/lesjones/gtminifaq.html
&gt; 10.2 Modems and Hardware viruses --------------------------------- There 
is no modem virus that spreads via an undocumented subcarrier - whatever that 
means.... There is no virus that causes damage to hardware. 10.3 Email viruses 
------------------- Any file virus can be transmitted as an E-mail attachment. 
However, the virus code has to be executed before it actually infects. Sensibly 
configured mailers and browsers don't allow this: check yours. In particular, 
check that your Web browser doesn't automatically pass Word documents to Word 6 
to open, since this may result in embedded macros being launched. 10.4 JPEG/GIF 
viruses ---------------------- There is no known way in which a virus could 
sensibly be spread by a graphics file such as a JPEG or .GIF file, which does 
not contain executable code. Macro viruses work because the files to which they 
are attached are not 'pure' data files. 10.5 Hoaxes Help ----------------- If 
you should receive a virus warning, look at these sites before forwarding it 
along (in fact, it's probably never justified to pass on a virus alert 
indiscriminately, and reputable antivirus companies don't do this. In fact, the 
information that such and such a virus exists is not, in itself, useful to the 
average computer user, even if it does. A statement like, &quot;Please forward 
to everyone!&quot; is one mark of a hoax. Computer Virus Myths home page &lt;

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/net-abuse-faq/scams/&gt; Corporates who haven't sorted 
out their hoax management strategy might get some mileage out of my mini-paper 
on &quot;Dealing with Internet Hoaxes&quot;, though it's getting a bit long in 
the tooth. It is, however, one of the few papers on the subject which deals 
with it from an adminstrator's/manager's point of view as well as from an 
everyday user/victim's. [DH] 
++&lt;http://www.sherpasoft.org.uk/anti-virus/hoaxes.txt&gt; I'm slightly 
surprised to find that I'm managing an EICAR project in this area: watch this 
space. 11.0 Glossary ============== * Change Detectors/Checksummers/Integrity 
Checkers - programs that keep a database of the characteristics of all 
executable files on a system and check for changes which might signify an 
attack by an unknown virus. * Cryptographic Checksummers use an encryption 
algorithm to lessen the risk of being fooled by a virus that targets that 
particular checksummer. * Dropper - a program that installs a virus or Trojan, 
often covertly. * Generic - catch-all name for antivirus software that doesn't 
know about individual viruses, but attempts to detect viruses by detecting 
virus-like code, behaviour, or changes in files containing executable code. * 
Heuristic scanners - scanners that inspect executable files for code using 
operations that might denote an unknown virus. * Monitor/Behaviour Blocker - a 
TSR that monitors programs while they are running for behaviour which might 
denote a virus. * Scanner (conventional scanner, command-line scanner, 
on-demand scanner) - a program that looks for known viruses by checking for 
recognisable patterns ('scan strings', 'search strings', 'signatures') or using 
a more flexible algorithmic approach for detection of polymorphic viruses, 
which can't be found by a search for a simple scan string. These are not 
usually associated with the Macintosh platform, but there are Word Macro 
viruses which exhibit mutation. * Trojan (Trojan Horse) - a program intended to 
perform some covert and usually malicious act that the victim did not expect or 
want. It differs from a destructive virus in that it doesn't reproduce, (though 
this distinction is by no means universally accepted). * Virus - a program (a 
block of executable code) that attaches itself to, overwrites or otherwise 
replaces another program in order to reproduce itself without the knowledge of 
the computer user. Most viruses are comparatively harmless, and may be present 
for years with no noticeable effect: some, however, may cause random damage to 
data files (sometimes insidiously, over a long period) or attempt to destroy 
files and disks. Others cause unintended damage. Even benign viruses 
(apparently non-destructive viruses) cause significant damage by occupying disk 
space and/or main memory, by using up CPU processing time, by introducing the 
risk of incompatibilities and conflicts, and by the time and expense wasted in 
detecting and removing them. 12.0 General Reference Section 
=============================== 12.1 Mac Newsgroups --------------------
comp.sys.mac.apps comp.sys.mac.comm comp.sys.mac.misc comp.sys.mac.system 
comp.virusalt.comp.virus The focus on these two groups tends to be 
IBM-compatible, but Mac issues are certainly aired. Alt.comp.virus is 
unmoderated, and the quality of the advice and opinions aired there is very 
variable - there are many reputable and expert posters, and many mischievous 
and misleading contributions. Caveat lector.... comp.virus lies dormant for 
years at a time, but is well worth watching when there's anything there. 12.2

Mac troubleshooting ========================= Since the initial release of this 
document, a number of people have E-mailed me asking for help with a possibly 
virus-related problem. While I'll always help if I can, I should point out (1) 
I'm an experienced Mac user and an IT support professional, but I don't claim 
to be a Mac expert (2) pressure of work and other commitments and a huge E-mail 
turnover means that I can't promise a quick or in-depth response [DH]. Whether 
you mail direct or post to a relevant newsgroup, it's helpful if you can supply 
a few details, such as: * Which model of Macintosh you're using. It may be 
useful to know how much RAM it has, the size of the hard disk, and any 
peripherals you're using. * Which version of MacOS you're using. * Which 
applications you're using, and which version. If you're using Word, it may be 
critical to know whether you're using version 6 or later, or an earlier 
version. * Which, if any, antivirus packages you use, and what version number. 
If you're using NAV, for instance, what version? * List any error messages or 
alerts that have appeared. * List any recent changes in configuration, 
additional hardware etc. * List any diagnostic/repair packages you've tried, 
and the results. * List any other steps you've taken towards determining the 
cause of the problem and/or trying to fix it, e.g. rebuilding the desktop, 
booting without extensions, zapping PRAM etc. Here are a few steps that it 
might be appropriate to try if virus scanning with an up-to-date scanner finds 
nothing. This section will be improved when and if I have time. Rebuilding the 
desktop is by no means a cure-all, but rarely does any harm. It may be worth 
disabling extensions when you do this, especially if the operation doesn't seem 
to be completed successfully. To disable extensions, restart the machine with 
the shift key held down until you see an Extensions Off message. If you're 
rebuilding the desktop, release the shift key and hold down Command (the key 
with the Apple outline icon) &amp; Options (alt) until requested to confirm 
that you want to rebuild. Disabling extensions is also a good starting point 
for tracking down an extensions conflict. If booting without extensions appears 
to bypass the problem, try removing extensions with Extensions Manager (System 
7.5) - remove one at a time, and replace it before removing the next one and 
booting with that one removed. Remember that if removing one stops the problem, 
it's still worth putting it back and trying all the others to see if you can 
find one it's conflicting with. Extensions Manager also lets you disable 
control panels. If you don't have Extensions Manager, try Now Utilities or 
Conflict Catcher. Parameter RAM (PRAM) contains system information, notably the 
settings for a number of system control panels. 'Zapping' PRAM returns possibly 
corrupt PRAM data to default values. A likely symptom of corrupted PRAM is a 
problem with date and time (but could be a symptom of a corrupted system file). 
With system 7, hold down Command-Option-P-R at bootup until the Mac beeps and 
restarts. You may have restore changes to some control panels before your 
system works properly. If the reset values aren't retained, the battery may 
need replacing. -- End &quot;Viruses and the Macintosh&quot; version 1.6a by
