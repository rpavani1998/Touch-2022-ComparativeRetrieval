<title>Macs vs PCs - Education, Business, Anyone</title>
<body>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>Background</h1> 
<p>In mid-2000 our local North Carolina K-12 school district decided to 
&quot;standardize on the Windows/PC platform.&quot; At that time 90%+ of their 
computers were Macs. A group of local taxpayers (including teachers) felt that 
this was inappropriate from several perspectives, and started working on 
reviewing the merits of this decision.</p> 
<p>I, John Droz, was asked to be their spokesperson and to create this 
website. Over the last few years this site has taken on a life much bigger (and 
more important) than what happens in one small school district, so our emphasis 
now is on debunking PC myths. [For the curious, gohere for more details about 
our local situation.]</p> 
<p>This 2005 edition has been my second major redesign of the site since its 
inception in mid 2001... In honor of the Macintosh 20th year anniversary 
(2004), you&rsquo;ll note that I have included a few screen shots from the 1984 
Superbowl advertisement (one of the most acclaimed advertisement in history), 
as its message still resonates today. (Gohere to see the whole extraordinary 
thing.) As I&rsquo;ve said all along, even though I am<strong>not</strong> a 
professional web designer, hopefully you will find the site reasonably easy to 
navigate and attractively laid out.</p> 
<p>Also, I look at my role here as more of an editor than an author. My 
challenge has been to find (i.e. research) and read well over<strong>four 
thousand studies, reports, and articles</strong> that have been published on 
the Mac<em>vs</em> PC topic. No small matter. The majority of these were 
discarded for a variety of reasons (too obtuse, outdated, repetitious, etc.).
</p> 
<p>The bulk of my time was then spent with the remaining 1200&plusmn;, trying 
to digest them in more detail, then synopsizing the material, and organizing 
each one into the site. My main objective was to be able to transcribe all this 
technical mumbo-jumbo into an educational, interesting, readable &mdash; and 
occasionally even entertaining &mdash; report. Hope you find it so.</p> <br>

<h1>Before digging deeper...</h1> 
<ul> 
<li>Although the information presented here was originally designed for 
schools,<strong>it is now applicable for any business or individual who is 
making a Mac/PC decision...</strong></li> 
<li> We realize that &quot;PC&quot; stands for &quot;Personal Computer&quot; 
&mdash; which means that Macs<strong>are</strong> PCs. However, since common 
usage implies that PC means an &quot;IBM compatible&quot; computer with 
Microsoft Windows as its sole operating system (<em>aka</em> Wintel), that is 
what we will mean when we say PC here.</li> 
<li> If you are looking for icons doing backflips, etc. you&rsquo;ve come to 
the wrong place. This web site is designed<strong>to help you make a more 
informed computer purchase</strong>, not to showcase web page design &mdash; 
i.e.<i>the emphasis is on the 115&plusmn; pages (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;) of 
ad-free content.</i></li> 
<li>If I knew more code I could probably do a better job of having pages look 
optimum for all browsers on all platforms. In any case, I&rsquo;ve tried to 
choose good fonts and sizes. If you have suggestions for making the text more 
readable, please let me know.</li> 
<li>To make this site more useful, I have set up the HTML so that when you 
click on a link, a<strong>new window</strong> will open with that information 
(while keeping the page you were on, in the background). After you look the new 
page over and then close that window (a simple keyboard shortcut), you will 
immediately be back at the original referencing page. This should make 
navigation simpler for you.</li> 
<li> One of the purposes of these pages is to <strong>benefit the ENTIRE Mac 
community</strong>, so if you need to reference <strong>any</strong> material 
on this site, please feel free to do so. (Please attribute proper credit.) 
Sending us a copy of published references would be appreciated.</li> 
<li> <i>Despite doing my best I now find that I am getting a bit behind in 
keeping the site up-to-date. At this time I have over 150 new reports and 
articles to be incorporated into the website. If you have the time and interest 
to assist with this, please let me know!</i></li> 
<li> Any Windows/PC advocates who have nothing better to do than flame me, 
feel free to do sohere. However, to be accurately informed, I would suggest 
that you first read the<strong>ENTIRE site</strong> (115&plusmn; pages of some 
1200 referenced reports, studies, etc.).</li> 
<p>Download a single printable PDF version of the whole site,<br>
<strong>with 
hyperlinks and bookmarks</strong> (115&plusmn; pages, 1.8 MB; <strong>Revised: 
5/04/05</strong>).<br>
<br>
 [<i>Periodically check the revision date of this 
file:<br>
 significant changes will be result in a modified version and a new 
date.<br>
 We do major updates about once a year.<br>
 In the meantime, check 
the web pages for the latest material.</i>]<br>
<br>
 [<i>This is an 
intermediate update since we are falling behind a bit here.<br>
 Rather than 
have people wait for the final version, this can be printed out now.<br>
 About 
2/3 of the pages have been revised, but not all hyperlinks are set yet.</i>]</p>
<p>Download (for all platforms) Adobe Reader (to read PDF files).</p> 
<p> In my Internet travels, I found a few sites (none gave direct attribution)
<br> that said something similar to the following:<br>
<br>
 In Japan, they 
have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft error messages with Haiku 
poetry messages. This type of poetry has strict construction rules &mdash; each 
poem has only 17 syllables: 5 syllables in the first line,<br>
 7 in the 
second, and 5 in the third.<br>
<br>
 Haikus are used to communicate a timeless 
message, often achieving<br>
 a wistful, yearning and powerful insight through 
extreme brevity.<br>
 On each of our main section pages I will cite an example:
<br><br>
<strong><i>Out of memory.<br>
 We wish to hold the whole sky,<br>
 But 
we never will.</i></strong><br>
<br>
 My idea of a Haiku would be something 
like this (remember I am a Physicist):<br>
<br>
<strong><i>Choose Mac or PC?<br>
 Now everyone wants to know.<br>
 The answer is clear.</i></strong></p> </ul>

<h1><br>
Contribute</h1> 
<p>Since I started this site in March of 2001, I have put well over fifteen 
hundred hours into researching material, putting it all together, editing 
updates, creating PDFs, answering email, etc. I would like to think that the 
resulting pages are a comprehensive, beneficial, and unique resource towards 
helping people get a better understanding of the very important Mac vs PC issue.
</p> 
<p>But this amount of time has had a serious impact on my life: economic and 
otherwise. If you would like to encourage me to continue this effort &mdash; or 
if you find the work already done to be useful to you &mdash; a Paypal 
contribution would be<strong>most</strong> appreciated: just click on the 
Paypal icon below.</p> 
<p><strong>THANKS!</strong></p> <br>
