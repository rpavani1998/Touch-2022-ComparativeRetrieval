 I depends on what 
operating system you prefer to use. If you want to use adobe photoshop then 
using it on a mac or windows pc will make now difference.<br>
If you want to 
decide between a mac or windows pc for general use, then I'll list you some 
pros and cons:<br>
<br>
Mac <br>
Pros: <br>
Does not easily get viruses and 
malware.<br>
Looks pretty. <br>
All the cool kids use them. (Very likely you 
will be pressured to get one if you are in the graphic design field just to fit 
in.)<br>
Good customer service. <br>
Easy to figure out what to buy, as they do 
everything for you.<br>
Cons: <br>
Very expensive (you will be paying 
substantially more for the same exact hardware you would get on a windows 
machine just for the brand name).<br>
You will have to get used to using it if 
you've used windows all your life.<br>
Cannot use software/programs not made 
for Mac (you can use a program that runs Windows on your Mac, however that is 
also very expensive and involves partitioning your hard drive.)<br>
<br>

Windows PC<br>
Pros: <br>
Less expensive than Mac. <br>
Can run the majority of 
software made today, as most of it is made for Windows.<br>
You are probably 
used to using a Windows operating system.<br>
Very good selection when it comes 
to purchasing choice.<br>
More customizable (although this probably doesn't 
concern the average user like you.)<br>
Cons: <br>
Can get viruses and malware 
very easy (you should scan it often with anti-virus programs).<br>
Customer 
service depends your your retailer.<br>
May be a bit confusing if you don't 
know what to buy.<br>
<br>
In my opinion you should get a Windows PC, because I 
like them better, however like I said before it comes down to which one you 
prefer using. A school like Long Beach doesn't seem that pretentious, so I 
wouldn't worry too much about fitting in. If you are really interested in 
trying out a Mac, try to find someone you know who has one and will let you 
screw around on it for a bit. Oh and by the way, if you ever need help finding 
a computer to buy, I'd be more than happy to help. Reply<b></b> <br>

Adobe products work more efficiently on Macs than PCs with the same stat's 
hardware wise. Adobe and Apple made a deal so that the Adobe programming worked 
better with the mac OS. 3d is best on Windows or Unix but only factories use 
Unix(most stable OS Linux is a modded core version)<br>

 3 deviants are out of 
date <br>
<br>
There was a time when Mac's ruled the roost as far as graphic 
design went. Windows was clunky and simply could not handle the processing 
load. You may or may not have noticed but recently Mac's started using Intel 
processors. So essentially, that $2,400 MacBook is exactly the same thing as 
that $800 Windows laptop. It essentially comes down to what you know, and what 
you're familiar with. If you know windows, use a PC. You'll already be learning 
Photoshop, no need to learn a new OS as well.<br>
<br>
Now, here's the IT guy 
in my coming out (that's my day job), if you ever plan on taking your computer 
to work or to school or anything else like that, I'd highly advise getting a 
PC. Macs are cool computers and I totally love 'em for what they are, but they 
DON'T play nice in most business networks. Schools are typically a bit more 
friendly, but even then you can run into issues.<br>
<br>
So there's my 
two-cents. Go with what you know <br>
