<b> &quot;Should Our 
Schools (or Anybody Else) Have Macs or PCs?,&quot;</b> by John Droz.  (&quot;In 
mid-2000 our local K-12 school district decided to 'standardize on the 
Windows/PC platform.' Currently they are 90%+ Mac. A group of local citizens 
felt that this was very unfortunate from several perspectives and started 
working on reviewing the merits of this decision. I, John Droz, was asked to be 
their spokesperson and to create this website.&quot; In a series of pages, Droz 
takes issue with many of the contentions commonly made in support of a move to 
standardize on the Windows OS. Here are the highlights...) <br>

<b>  &quot;I Am Not a Mac Fanatic,&quot;</b> by Jeff Adkins, posted 10/9/03.  
(&quot;I am not a Mac fanatic... I prefer Macs. For many of the tasks I do, 
they suit me just fine. I must use a PC for some tasks, because there is no Mac 
alternative. I have no problem with that. Using the right tool for the job is 
logical and prudent.&quot; An impassioned piece; highly recommended.)<br>

<b>  &quot;The 
secret's out: Mac's cheaper,&quot;</b> by David Frith, on the Australian IT web 
site, June 25, 2002. (&quot;Apple last year hired Gartner to conduct a survey 
at Melbourne University - which operates a mixed network - to see how the costs 
of operating the two computing platforms worked out... Gartner, like most 
market researchers, does a lot of that kind of paid work. Like all of us it 
needs the money... But, naturally enough, it prefers to keep the results 
separate from its own independent surveys of technology trends, which must be 
seen to be strictly impartial...&quot; Bottom line: &quot; The major finding: 
the uni's Macs were easier and cheaper to own and run than its Windows 
machines... Not just a bit cheaper - a whopping 36 per cent less costly.&quot;)

<b>  &quot;APPLTalk Systems 
Shootouts,&quot;</b> by Charles Gaba, last updated on 6/19/03 (&quot;While 
others touch on Apple's traditional strongholds such as ease-of-use, 
trouble-free operation, and organic design, I have chosen to tackle the Wintel 
world in its own traditional territory -- cheap pricing of components,&quot; 
says Gaba. &quot;For 17 years, the Mac has always been considered a superior 
overall experience, while the Windows PC has had the advantage of having a 
lower up-front cost. I decided to see how true the 'Macs are more expensive' 
factor is today.&quot;)<br>

<b>  Stewart Alsop, &quot;My Old Flame: The 
Macintosh. I'm rethinking the Mac as a factor in computing. One simple reason: 
The Macintosh seems to work.&quot;</b> FORTUNE.com, 6/25/01.  Five years ago, 
Stewart Alsop, an influential columnist for FORTUNE.com, made a huge splash by 
publicly repudiating the Macintosh. Guess what? He has changed his mind! He is 
using a Macintosh again and declares: &quot;Unlike Windows, the Macintosh seems 
to work.&quot; Now see Alsop's more recent column, a highly critical review of 
Windows XP:  &quot;XP Means Extra Pain: Microsoft Windows XP promised to usher 
in an era of computing in which users suffer less. Aspirin, anyone?,&quot; 
FORTUNE.com, 4/29/02. If you read to the bottom of his scathing review of 
Windows XP, you'll find a rather more favorable comment about Macintosh OS X.

<b>  &quot;Can a Windows guy learn to love the Mac? You bet!,&quot;

(&quot;'Can a Windows-dependent technology columnist live happily as a Mac 
user? That's the question I am about to spend a month of my life trying to 
answer.' That's how I started my 'month on Mac' series, which now runs toseven 
columns. Yes, it's been three months rather than one, but I had my reasons for 
stretching it out.... I like this little iMac and don't want to give it up. 
It's a whole lot more fun than my Windows machine, and a great creative tool 
for whacking out these daily columns.&quot;)<br>

get along?,&quot; April 23, 2002. (Morgenstern quotes favorably both PC and Mac 
supporters, but his bottom line is this: &quot;...the Mac can be a suitable 
replacement for a Windows desktop and live successfully in a PC environment. 
...some folks work better on the Macintosh. Isn't it about time for the 
enterprise to consider accommodating alternate computing platforms?&quot;)<br>

56 of the original 75 Macintosh Advantages still remain (not counting one 
Advantage awarded two credits); 18 Advantages are either neutralized due to 
improvements in Windows or abandonment from Apple, and one Advantage is still 
being researched. The totals may change again if I am persuaded by my 
well-informed readers that I have some flaw in my reasoning.&quot;) <br>
