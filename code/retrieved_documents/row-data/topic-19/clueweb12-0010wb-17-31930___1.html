<h2>Two good BPM counter/Analyzer for Mac and PC.</h2>  Many DJ's are 
&quot;switching up&quot; to computers as the new way to DJ. They provide 
near-instant access to large song lists and can be integrated to control video 
and DMX lighting.<br>

<h3>Two good BPM counter/Analyzer for Mac and PC.</h3> 
<p>by <strong>Dj Sean</strong> &raquo; Tue Jul 25, 2006 5:43 pm </p>  Well I 
searched around and didn't find a thread about BPM analyzer's.<br>
As more and 
more DJ's are converting to Laptops and digital libraries, the advantage's and 
feature's are improving all the time.<br>
<br>
So I, about a week ago, I found 
Beatuneshttp://www.beatunes.com/  for Mac, and now I can tell you what I think 
about it. <br>
<br>
There is a similar program for PC called Mix Meister<br>

http://www.mixmeister.com/download.html <br>
I have not used this prog but, 
have heard many good things from many other DJ boards. And you can probably 
find many reviews of it as well. <br>
<br>
So how do analyzers work?? They are 
ideal for running at home or left running over night as they will work in the 
background, you can still surf the net, etc, while it anyalyzes your WHOLE 
library, it then automatically enters in the information into itunes for you. 
This is better than manually entering in your BPM's for thousands of songs, as 
this can take for ever!!!<br>
<br>
All in all, beatunes, is stable, if your 
worried about it messing things up just select to analyze a couple albums, and 
see for your self. It has many customizable options, and is very easy to use, 
even for the not so technically inclined.<br>
<br>
One great option is, you can 
tell it to only analyze the songs without the Bpm's, so if you already have 
half your library with bpm's it will only analyze the other half.<br>
<br>
It 
also has a sliding scale option of analyzing, that looks kinda like this.<br>

<br>Analyzing option <br>
<br>
Fastest-----------|------------More accurate. 
<br> <br>
I personally left it at the default which is right in the middle. <br>
For 7,000 songs took 3 days to analyze on a G4 1.67Ghz laptop, and it is very 
accurate, it even has decimels ex: 96.4 bpms<br>
<br>
So I would suggest 
leaving the analyzing option where it is or even sliding it towardFaster. <br>

<br>Out of 7,000+ songs it only had trouble with 4, not bad at all, in my 
opinion. For those 4 I just manually entered in the bpm, and then I was all 
done.<br>
<br>
Also, did I mention, Beatunes si free for 7 days, after that 
trial period, I believe it only costs, $30 bucks.<br>
<br>
Well, I hope my 
little review helps, have a great day, and have a great time with the new 
programs!!! <br>
