<h4>Randsco Site Map</h4> Site Map 
<p>Again, this is something that I've been wanting to do for some time and I 
believe that a site map is necessary to help those people out that have a hard 
time figuring out what is what on our site. I'd like to think that our menu 
system is easy and will work, but some people just require a site map to figure 
it out. So ... here you go ... a site map. (It currently sucks, which is why 
it's shown as display:none!)</p> 
<h4>About the Kimlers</h4> about us 
<p>This is where visitors can find out about Randsco and the Kimler family. 
Who are we? How did we come to be? What motivates us on our adventures. It's 
kinda like the old &quot;meet scott and rachel&quot; section on our PCT 
WebPage, but this &quot;about us&quot; section will be a stand-alone page.</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3> 
<p>FEATURED DONOR: The &quot;Red Dirt Emporium&quot;, located in the historic 
&quot;Bricktown District&quot; of Oklahoma City, made a donation toward - and 
is using - Photo-caption Zoom Version 3. The Red Dirt Emporium was founded in 
2007 and has a goal of introducing visitors and locals to the best that 
Oklahoma has to offer. They specialize in Oklahoma resources, art, music and 
other items that celebrate Oklahoma</p> 
<p>Since they are largely responsible for the &quot;Thank You&quot; section of 
our sidebar and this &quot;Shout Outs&quot; blog, it's fitting that one of the 
first shouts should go to Oklahoma'sRed Dirt Emporium.</p> 
<p>What's the story?</p> 
<p>Simple.</p> 
<p>The Red Dirt Emporium was one of the few companies (or people) that made an 
unsoliciteddonation for their commercial usage of the Photo-caption Zoom v3 
technique.</p> 
<p>Not only was their contribution unsolicited, but they didn't require any 
support to get it deployed.</p> 
<p>One day, a donation email arrived and I thought, &quot;Wow. Cool. I really 
should find a way to say 'Thank You' to them (and others who've helped Randsco) 
... I know I've been meaning to ... I just need to DO IT!&quot;</p> 
<p>So, I made this section and (slowly) have begun populating it with some of 
the many people and companies that have - in some way - supported or helped 
Randsco. It's provides a formal way of saying &quot;Thanks&quot; and helps to 
promote their website (in a Search-Engine-friendly kind of way).</p> 
<p><em>To learn how Oklahoma's Red Dirt Emporium is using Photo-caption Zoom 
and about some of their unique products, carry on ...</em></p>

<h2>Mac -vs- PC</h2> Filed in: <strong>Humor</strong> <br>
The&nbsp;Web <br>

<h3> Mac -vs- PC </h3>  March 20th, 2007&nbsp; &middot; stk <br>

<p><strong>Mac vs. PC</strong> ... You've seen the Mac ads on television, 
where Mr. PC ends up looking like a goof? Well, here's an underground reversal 
that had me giggling. You'll find it funny too!</p> Macromedia Flash Player 
(tm) 7 required <br>

<p>You've seen those Macintosh ads on television, where there's a guy that 
represents a Mac computer and a guy that's supposed to be a PC? Clever, for 
sure! Well, here's a different spin on them and they're a tad in PC's favor! 
(An underground backlash, if you will).</p> 
<p>Interestingly enough, after finding these videos, I did a quick search for 
&quot;Mac vs PC&quot; on google.ca and what did I find as the number one entry? 
APPLE! But the funny part is that they list<strong>TEN</strong> reasons to get 
a Mac. (If you go to the site, they list<strong>SIXTEEN</strong> reasons. Can't 
they count? Not that more isn't better, but why say 10, when you supposedly 
have 16?)</p> 
<p>Honestly, I'm not a die-hard PC fan. I've had my share of problems with Mr. 
PC and I'm not married to a brand. In fact, I nearly considered getting a Mac 
for my last purchase. OSX is cool. The ability to run UNIX and Windows. Sweet. 
But for some reason, Mac seems to hold their technology a tad too close to 
their chest, which is why I find this video so humorous.</p> 
<p>I hope you do too!</p> 
<p><em>More humor on the next page ... </em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> Macromedia Flash Player (tm) 7 required <br>

<p><strong>Which is better?</strong> Isn't that what it's all about?</p> 
<p>I don't know. Is it like choosing a Ford or a Chevrolet? Or is it a 
Cadillac or a Yugo? Honestly.</p> 
<p>If you're looking for opinions, you can find LOTS. One place to try is 
Epinions.</p> 
<p>You can take a more quantitative approach and look at System Shoot-outs. If 
you readMac vs PC, it seems that Mac is the winner hands-down.</p> 
<p>HEY ... I'm all for giving the Mac a try. If anyone wants to pony up a 
donation, I'm all ears. Just make it a BIG Mac, cause I've got an appetite for 
computing!!</p> 
<p>An lastly, not AS IF this is the ultimate comparison, but as of 2003, the 
Forbes 400 (richest people in the U.S.) had Bill Gates at #1 with a net worth 
of $40B and Steve Jobs was #49, with a net worth of $5B. While I'd LOVE to have 
EITHER balance in my bank account, Bill's about 8X better off than Steve. Luck, 
happenstance or maybe a better game plan? Maybe Mr. PC is eight times better 
than the Mac dude?</p> 
<p>Either way ... as Popeye says ... &quot;Eye'am what Eye'yam&quot; (or ... 
it is what it is).</p> 
<p>In any case ... SOMEONE loves PC!! (Otherwise these videos wouldn't exist)!
</p> 
<p><strong>ENJOY</strong></p> <br>

 idiot <br>
 they said TOP TEN reasons for 
switching<br>
 which means two things <br>
 1. there may be a 100000000 reasons 
to switch but they have shown 10<br>
 2. your dim-witted brain is too old to 
interpret this so if you don't understand, shut your hole <br>

 Maclover - Your rude, name-calling, 
puctuation-less and poorly capitalized comment puts Mac users in poor company 
and reflects badly on the entire country of India. <br>
<br>
 1) There <em>may
</em> be aliens living in your backyard, but the fact is that they showed 16 
reasons, then listed them as the top 10.<br>
<br>
 2) No hole is utilized to 
leave a comment - fingers are!<br>
