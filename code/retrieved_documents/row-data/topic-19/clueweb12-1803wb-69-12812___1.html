<h2>Dear Ben &amp; Frank</h2> 
<h1>Which is better, Mac or PC?</h1> 
<h3>Question Submitted by Anonymous</h3> 
<p>Ben SaysI prefer Mac, but a certain computer does not make you a better or 
worse designer. I used a PC when I was in design school.</p>

<p>Frank SaysI use a Mac, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. A lot of my design 
heros would run circles around me with colored paper and a pair of scissors.</p>
