<p> <i>Note: This isn&rsquo;t a guide to evangelize and convert people from 
Windows to Mac OS X. It&rsquo;s a guide to give people options. If you&rsquo;re 
happy with what you&rsquo;ve got, great! But if you&rsquo;re interested in 
alternatives read on.</i></p> 
<p>After my first article on Macs and OS X, there were several readers who 
just down right bashed Macs for pricing and OS X without solid reasoning or 
legitimate hand&rsquo;s on experience of Macs. So this is a follow-up.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s get straight to the point. <i>Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</i> 
isn&rsquo;t about being a &quot;PC fanboy.&quot; It&rsquo;s about finding the 
best hardware, revealing up and coming tech and debunking predetermined 
notions. That begs the question, especially here:<b>what&rsquo;s so special 
about a Mac anyway?</b></p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the short answer: nothing really, just some very elegant 
aluminum chassis designs.<b>The key, is the operating system</b>. Even still, 
let&rsquo;s settle this issue about price.</p> 
<p>In a recent comment, someone came up with an analogy that a Mac isn&rsquo;t 
really a<i>BMW</i>, but rather a <i>Hyundai</i> dressed up in a nice exterior. 
One problem: Hyundai&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have nice European car exteriors. And 
to generalize it this way shows the lack of willing to understand the core of 
the Mac: it&rsquo;s operating system. Because that&rsquo;s really what 
it&rsquo;s about. But for the sake of these first few pages, let&rsquo;s leave 
Mac OS X out of the picture for now. Let&rsquo;s just see where Apple comes in 
on hardware.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In terms of hardware, there&rsquo;s nothing really special about a Mac 
aside from elegant designs, be it a Mac Pro or MacBook Pro, that makes it 
incredibly more worthwhile than the PC equivalent. And there&rsquo;s no doubt 
that you can get an equally equipped PC, or build one yourself, for less money. 
In fact, I mentioned this in my previous article, although some people seemed 
to have completely missed the page where I complained about Apple&rsquo;s 
outrageous prices altogether. However, building a PC to do the same isn&rsquo;t 
the point, because you can always buy a cheaper car to get you from A to B. 
Instead, let&rsquo;s see what you can get for $2000, from Apple and from 
others. For $2000, do you really get much less?</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at some of Apple&rsquo;s competition and 
their pricing structure compared to Apple&rsquo;s:</p> 
<p>We went to Dell&rsquo;s website and picked out what Dell indicated was a 
serious gaming laptop. We also took the XPS model that was priced the same as 
the baseline MacBook Pro. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the results.</p> 
<p></p>  Apple vs. Dell Price Comparison <strong>$1999 MacBook Pro</strong>

<br>

<p></p> 
<p>For the most part, the two systems are comparable, indicating that at least 
for a laptop, Apple&rsquo;s pricing fits in line with comparable hardware. 
Certain things like shared memory for graphics leave some performance desires 
for the XPS, but the XPS has a strong leg up on the MacBook Pro with the larger 
screen size.</p> 
<p>Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro has several small advantages over the XPS, mainly 
with the MagSafe connector and it&rsquo;s nearly take-for-granted use. I have 
seen several incidences where people have tripped over or through someone 
else&rsquo;s MacBook Pro power cord and the MagSafe design literally saved the 
laptops from flying.</p> 
<p>The biggest differences are the screen size, weight, thickness, and shared 
memory. For absolute performance, the screen size won&rsquo;t matter here, but 
the slow shared graphics memory on the XPS will. For a laptop that Dell 
indicates is a gaming machine, shared memory is a disappointment, as graphics 
is an important area for 3D gaming.</p> 
<p>For another comparison, let&rsquo;s look at the MacBook Air to 
VoodooPC&rsquo;s Envy 133:</p>

<br>

<p></p> 
<p>At this point, the Envy is $300 more expensive than the MacBook Air. 
Although the Envy 133 does include an external optical drive, tacking on 
Apple&rsquo;s quite expensive $99 MacBook Air SuperDrive to the purchase of the 
MacBook Air still leaves a $200 gap.</p> 
<p>Bottom line: Macs aren&rsquo;t &quot;way more&quot; expensive than PCs. So 
where do things get really hairy with Apple? Upgrades.Apple really stabs you in 
the face when you&rsquo;re upgrading your Mac. All goes well when you want to 
buy a base system, but as soon as you want to add options, be prepared to be 
murdered. I&rsquo;ll talk about this later.</p>

<p>The OS is proprietary since the EULA states you cannot use it on non-Apple 
hardware. Not because it doesn't have market share. Because it does.<br>
<br>

My gripe with apple's pricing is that there are no real budget oriented 
options. The cheapest macbook is 1000$+. The cheapest laptop I can find with 
Vista is 600 or less at Costco/Sams Club.<br>
<br>
Everyone says that OS X is 
faster and yada yada yada. I know people are going to shoot me for this, but I 
find all of the fancy desktop effects to be VERY laggy except on laptops with a 
dedicated video card. The Laptops especially slow to a crawl unless they have 
&gt;2gb of ram. Like Vista. I work on these every day and if I ever bought one, 
it'd be for the looks- the OS is nothing special IMO. I'd install Vista on it.

<p>Cherry picking over-priced PCs does little to prove your point. I realize 
that when you're going the Apple route you don't have many options, but those 
of us on the PC side have TONS of options... and even the most basic among us 
would be able to purchase higher performing, lower cost PCs than the ones you 
selected to go up against the Apples.<br>
<br>
For $1549 I purchase an HP 
laptop w/ 4 GB of RAM, 20.1 inch screen, Blu-Ray, 5 speakers, and an Nvidia 
8800 GTS. My system absolutely crushes that $2000 MacBook Pro in every 
category... and still cost $450 less.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong... I 
&quot;get&quot; Apple. They look awesome, are well built, have an awesome 
retail presence, and they are right for some people... just not for me.</p>

<p>Funny how you are comparing base model MAC's to bleeding edge PC's. That my 
dear journalist is not comparing apples to apples. It is comparing apples to 
apple pie. Big difference. That just goes to prove for that same cost as a very 
high end PC you can get a base model MAC with a very proprietary OS (i.e. can't 
install it on anything but a mac with invoking the Jobs cops, check the EULA). 
Please if you make the mistake of buy an Airbook have fun changing the battery 
(you can't) or watching a DVD while on the road (again you can't no built in 
DVD drive).</p> hixbot  08/04/2008 5:49 PM <br>

<p>Wow, you took a PC desktop with identical hardware and proved that it would 
cost the same as the baseline Mac Pro.<br>
What's the point? You can build a PC 
with hardware that isn't identical but PERFORMS better for CHEAPER. Picking the 
same overpriced PC components doesnt prove anything.</p> customisbetter

<p>i read the first page and stopped. Apples are designed to look good and be 
reliable. I get that and many other people do as well. They really aren't 
designed to be performers for cheap. The PC will ALWAYS win in the price 
category (and usually performance as well) because you pay for the reliability 
and style of Apple. Please stop comparing the two.<br>
Just to humour you 
though. The ENVY has a Carbon Fiber Chassis. BAM! There's 300 right there.<br>

BTW i am both a PC and Mac Owner.</p> angry_ducky  08/04/2008 5:55 PM <br>

<p>I don't think that comparing the MacBook Pro and the XPS M1730 is a good 
comparison; the XPS is a desktop-replacement gaming machine, and is therefore 
bigger and heavier than the Mac. Also, the 8700M GT will outperform the 8600GT, 
and I am unable to find where it specifies that the 8700 has shared graphics 
memory.<br>
<br>
Dell sells the XPS M1530 which is a 15.4 inch laptop designed 
more for multimedia than for gaming (similar to the Mac). The M1530 starts at 
$1000, and with identical specs to the MacBook Pro (and Vista Ultimate), the 
price is $1650.</p> JWL3  08/04/2008 6:01 PM <br>

<p>The main point is that with PC's you have hundreds of different vendors I 
can buy a computer from. Due to competition the price is always lower. The 
author is being disingenuous by picking for comparison laptops at 
non-discounted prices. Dell ALWAYS has deals with $400-$500 off. Apple NEVER 
discounts their products.<br>
<br>
I bought an Acer laptop from Newegg.com 2 
weeks ago for $399. It came with a Dual core pentium, 120GB HD, and 1GB ram. 
What can you get for $399 at the Apple store - a tricked out ipod?<br>
<br>
Oh 
and another thing - if you play games at all, you can forget the Apple. Games 
just aren't made for it and the ones that are come out 1 year after the PC 
release.</p> JWL3  08/04/2008 6:08 PM <br>

<p>Additional thought:<br>
<br>
The author's main point is that Macs are 
similarly priced to PC's. Then halfway through the article, he states that MAC 
prices are at a premium because it's from a top-shelf manufacturer and it is 
sold to cater to a &quot;lifestyle. &quot;<br>
<br>
Which one is it you 
duplicitous fool? Are you actually acknowledging that Macs are severely 
overpriced vs. PC's?</p> Anonymous  08/04/2008 6:13 PM <br>

<br> 
<p>wow they messed up big time with this article. comparing thickness and 
weight of a 17&quot; laptop vs a 15&quot; macbook pro. sounds fair to me. also 
lets go ahead and say that the 8600m GT is faster than the 8700m GT. who wrote 
this, honestly? anyone who knows even a small amount about graphics cards 
should know that an 8700m GT does not use shared graphics memory. The 200GB 
drive in the dell is also most likely a 7200rpm vs the 5400rpm in the macbook 
pro. 802.11n wifi is a $20 upgrade on the dell, had to not include that to make 
the mac look better. Also that dell is designed for SLI graphics cards upto two 
8800m GTX with 1GB of memory, lets see the 6lb macbook pro do that. Different 
machines designed for different purposes. Pick a better comparison tom, 
seriously!</p> Anonymous  08/04/2008 6:16 PM <br>

<p>Wow Tuan? Why compare prices with a Dell XPS? How about you go down to your 
Local Frys/BestBuy or w/e and look at prices.<br>
<br>
Sony, with the same 
processor, better graphics, double the ram, bigger hard drive, and a Blue Ray 
drive, for $200 less.<br>
http://shop3.frys.com/product/5635 [...] IN_RSLT_PG
<br><br>
How much does it cost to get 4GB of ram on an Apple, oh yes another 
$200, so thats a $400 gap, and you still have a smaller screen, no blue ray 
drive, a smaller harddrive, and half the video memory.<br>
<br>
Your Component 
list, and Laptop comparisons were clearly set up to put the mac at an 
advantage. Because there are so many many PC vendors, it should not be hard to 
find one that is screwing its customers like apple and charging too much; but 
the prices at the store shelf tell the true story.<br>
<br>
Furthermore you 
choose two out of three products that are low volume special use items. The 
number of people that want a super thin and light notebook, or need a Dual Quad 
Core Machine, are very few. What program are you running that you need 8 
processing cores? High End specialty systems are always going to draw a high 
price; that is to be expected; that Apple is competitive in the $3000 range 
does not matter to the vast vast majority of people who spend not even half 
that.<br>
<br>
But when you compare Apple against a Mid range system, which the 
average buyer will be purchasing, the Mac falls short every time.<br>
<br>
How 
about Mac Monitors?<br>
20&quot; $600 really?<br>

<p>Seriously, I have NO IDEA why he compares the MACS to PCs with the EXACT 
SAME OVERPRICED HARDWARE. The point is you can pick a PC with cheaper hardware 
that can perform better. I completely agree that OSX is awesome and so are 
Mac's ergonomics. Those things may justify the extra cost for some, but this 
article attempts to prove that Macs are the same price. That's ridiculous. You 
can get a better performing PC for a fraction of the cost, and its not a 
misconception. The hardware in the PC will be cheaper, faster alternatives... 
obviously if you build a PC with the exact same overpriced hardware, it will be 
exactly the same price. Good grief. Tomshardware used to be my favorite site, 
because it had objective, technical articles. This is garbage.</p> PMR100

<p>MacBooks are way overpriced. Just look at the laptop below. The person who

<p>You may think I just down right bashed your last article.<br>
However I do 
have solid reasoning. I also have legitimate hand&rsquo;s on experience of 
[with] Macs.<br>
<br>
I see no point to your obvious Mac-fanboyism, though I'm 
sure you'd argue there is a point and that you are not a Mac fanboy.<br>
<br>

You attempt to argue Mac's are similarly priced to PC's. You then say Mac 
charges a premium.<br>
<br>
BTW a Mac is a PC! PC = Personal Computer.<br>
Mac 
is a brand name, so is Dell, HP, Alienware, Voodoo... These are all personal 
computers.</p> emp  08/04/2008 6:26 PM <br>

<p>I respect the fact that you 'tried' (Keyword here is tried) to show the 
good qualities of Mac computers, however this is mainly an enthusiast site, so 
you will be VERY hard pressed to fool us into thinking apple offerings are 
anywhere near as good as others (especially on price/performance ratio). We 
KNOW what we're buying, we KNOW what each piece of hardware is capable of 
doing, you can't just throw fancy numbers at us and expect us to fall for it.
<br><br>
The thing is, with the first article I thought you were just sharing 
your personal opinion, however, with this article it's clear you're an apple 
fanboy and will be labeled as such. And yes, I'm being brutally honest here... 
it's for your own good.</p> wh3resmycar  08/04/2008 6:27 PM <br>

<p>Not even close. You should be a little embarrased having published this 
article. I own a small computer retail chain and we actually have 2 back to 
school packages (1 Apple, 1 Windows) for the identical price and have yet to 
sell 1 of the Apple packages. For the same price the Windows Package runs the 
same CPU, 4GB memory, a 320GB HDD, better graphics, 16&quot; screen 16:9

<p>I've never used a MAC (OS X I should say) long enough to know anything 
about it so I'll take your word for it. It's faster. It's more reliable. It has 
many cool utilities. But let's face it, thats not why people have MACs. Mostly, 
scratch that, EVERYONE I know that owns a MAC, has it because, like you said, 
they want to be cool. But you know what, I want to see what all the hype is 
about. I need an OS for my new system so since OS X isn't proprietary, can you 
please point me to where I can pick up a copy to run on my computer. Thanks.</p>

<p>This article has no intellectual honesty whatsoever. I priced a matching 
XPS 1530 (same size screen and resolution), with identical specs to the Mac, 
excepting only the built-in bluetooth, for $1399. So that's a 42% premium for 
the Mac. Not only that, PC's aren't &quot;sole source&quot;, like Macs, leaving 
open the option to shop around for a better deal.</p> russki  08/04/2008 6:37 PM

<p>It would be a shame to regurgitate the above posts, but again, quite 
lackluster, Tuan. The funny part is that most of the utilities you mentioned 
when touting OSX are actually present in Vista (most obviously, the accelerated 
desktop with seamless animations). If you're gonna go comparing, compare latest 
gen vs. latest gen. Although OSX is *nix (I think BSD) based, *nix it is not. 
Heck, even Torvalds has been critical of the file system.<br>
<br>
There is yet 
to be a rational pro-OSX argument aside from the general idea of 
&quot;usability,&quot; which, admittedly, Apple spends a lot of time on and 
usually gets right. I gotta say though, I was forced to use one of these 
atrocities at a BestBuy the other day to access internet, and I was quite 
turned off by several things that appeared to be major annoyances. I am an 
experienced user, though, and like things to be my way; easily accessible; not 
screwed up. And I use all 5+ buttons on my mouse and the scroll wheels. The 
one-button mouse MUST DIE. A painful death.<br>
<br>
Out of the box, for a 
clueless person, Macs are indeed a good (albeit expensive; read the posts 
above) option. But c'mon, let's hear something actually convincing.<br>
<br>

How about this. The next version of Photoshop will only natively support x64 in 
Windows. This does result in better performance with larger files, and the 
media-junkies are Apple's historical bread and butter (by the way, write about 
WYSIWYG, color management, etc. for Apple, which is much better, actually). 
Whoops.<br>
<br>
Anyway. Better luck next time.<br>
