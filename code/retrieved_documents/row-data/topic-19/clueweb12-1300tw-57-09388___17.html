Kidology has been a breath of fresh air to me. We are creative but have become 
stuck in a certain mode of thinking and doing things. The ideas you have 
offered have so broadened our way of thinking and variety of avenues of 
teaching. I see it as God's provision - as we adjust the way we do things to be 
more effective in the lives of our children. Thank you so much.<br>

<p>OK - I'm gonna do it - I am going to open the CAN OF WORMS!&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>Which is better, the MAC or the PC!?</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;<strong>VS.</strong> </p> 
<p>I started out on PC with one of the&nbsp;first laptops, a Toshiba1000 - had 
to load the operating system every time I booted up! (I know, I'm getting old!) 
I went from a&nbsp;Laser 128 (a generic of&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;IIc) and then when 
PowerBook 180 came out, and everyone was jealous because MY laptop had16 shades 
of grey!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; OOOOH, aren't YOU amazed! Of course color came soon 
after.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>I was a loyal Mac user until Bill Gates stole (yes, STOLE) everything good 
about Mac with Windows 95, and I had to agree at that time, that 
Win95&nbsp;brought together the best of both and went back to being a PC Guy, 
though always with an eye on Apple, but I had to go with what most people used 
at work, and&nbsp;with this Kidology ministry I need the software only 
available on PC at the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(though I must admit that 
since 2000 our web designers have created Kidology.org on Macs!)</p> 
<p>Well, it finally happened, someone gave me a Mac G4 with OS X and I am 
trying it out 'on the side' and while I am still much faster with PC (I use 
more keyboard short-cuts than most people have ever heard of, rarely even need 
a mouse or touchpad) I am finding the Mac very fun and easy to use, a few 
quirks aside from being new to it.</p> 
<p>SO I LAY IT OUT THERE:</p> 
<p>1) WHICH DO YOU USE (the poll)</p> 
<p>2) AND WHICH DO THINK IS BETTER&nbsp;(not necessarily the same!) and <em>WHY
</em>?</p> 
<p>3) BIASED OPINIONS WELCOME!</p> 
<p>Be bold - I was just telling someone the other day, there are few people 
who are objective on this question!&nbsp; The word tends to be made up of Bill 
Gates haters and Bill Gates fans.&nbsp; Personally, I'm rather grateful to Bill 
Gates, without his vision, there may be no Kidology.org and the ability to 
network and equip and encourage children's workers through this site!&nbsp; But 
what is YOUR OPINION? I am very open to the making the 'switch' - but would say 
I am still 83% PC and 17% Mac at this point - which is a big move toward Mac!

 I'm going to have 
to claim ignorance on the Mac - very rarely have used one - I've been a PC 
person since the beginning. I am always amazed at what can be done on a mac and 
for the purposes of graphic editing and movie making, I'm VERY interested in a 
Mac. <br>

 Mac is always on the forefront of innovation. It's 
made me disappointed that MS stole so much of this and we give them our hard 
earned dollars despite this! <br>
Apple deserves our patronage for being the 
creative innovator.<br>
People say &quot;Macs are good for 
graphics/publishing&quot; but everything else PeeCee's are fine. Well, Macs are 
good at graphics/publishing because CREATIVITY is needed. That's the Mac, 
CREATIVE/INNOVATIVE. Just like Pastor Karl's Kidology Ministry. I think PK's 
Ministry would be unleashed and would know no bounds, Glory to God! <br>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> is the Apple logo, the bite out of the Apple, a 
symbol of the origin of sin?? Is that a subtle way of saying that to use a Mac 
is sin? Just curious.&nbsp;</p>

 Heh, does ye really have to ask what I use? An Apple, of 
course! I grew up on PCs; yeah, I even could program in BASIC on those pokey 
DOS-based computers back when I was 6-years-old.Then, almost a year ago, I 
bought a PowerMac G4, got Final Cut Pro installed on the sucker, and haven't 
looked back since.I did the Switch. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I now Think Different.  
Call it sinful, but in that case it's the most pleasurable sin of all. <br>
<br>
It's just soooooo nice, though, I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be in 
love with your computer. I'm a Power User, to be sure -- my life is on my 
computer. I have three days of music plugged intoiTunes and wouldn't dream of 
using any other media player. I have my life (and several other's) chronicled 
in pictures iniPhoto -- a couple thousand pictures, and can instantly create 
slideshows or coffee books or generate an online photo album or whatever with 
any of them. I can sooo easily create a quick movie whenever I need withiMovie, 
and then burn it onto DVD withiDVD -- and all in such brilliant style and speed.
<br> <br>
What's more, it all just works. <em>Together.</em> Your life is no 
longer a mess, spread about across multiple harddrives and random folders. You 
wanna add background music to a movie you're working on? Not a problem -- hit a 
single button in iMovie and it shows your whole iTunes library, separated into 
your playlists and everything else.<br>
<br>
My desktop is covered in lovely 
stickie notes andWidgets -- it's the most wonderful thing in the world. And 
they're not square box windows: they're just there, with little regard to the 
boxed confines of Windows. It's like my desktop is alive.<br>
<br>
Add to this 
Mac's recent operating system upgrade, Panther -- it's got so many useful 
productivity tools it's not funny. Hit one single button and every single 
window you have open -- which in my case is typically millions -- is 
automatically shrunken and scaled so that everything appears on the monitor. 
It's a simple matter of moving your mouse over which window you want, then. I 
suppose you gotta try it to get the full joy, but Alt-Tab's got nothin' on 
Apple, let me say.See? And that's not even my typical workload: that's just 
half a dozen Quicktimes, my DVD Player, and iTunes playing at the same time, 
along with a dozen or so pictures that I don't bother to close (why?), MSN 
Messenger, Mail, Safari -- my internet browser, Palm Desktop, iPhoto, half a 
dozen Widgets, and my screenplay. (Just, hehe. Usually I have the intensive 
Final Cut Pro and/or Photoshop -- and a few other programs running as well. And 
my computer handles everything; not a Blue Screen of Death in sight.) <br>
<br>

<br> <br>
And none of this is even to say how <strong>necessary</strong>, how 
<strong>integral</strong> Macs have become for all the graphics, publishing, 
and video work I do. As CTLady said, everycreative professional uses Macs 
simply because Macs<em>are</em> creative and professional -- hehe, and 
innovative. They suit our lifestyle, they're<em>conducive to creativity</em> -- 
which is so much more than I could ever have said about my old PC. Why else 
would anybodyedit award-winning films on Apple, carry the entire human genome 
on his iPod, shape America's visual culture as a designer's designer, compose 
Hollywood's best film scores, or even, for that matter, take tens of thousands 
of picture of African life and culture -- on anything <em><strong>but</strong>
</em> a Mac? <br>
<br>
Yeah, call me a crazy loon for being this fanatic about 
a simple computer -- but at least I'm a crazy loon who experiences absolute joy 
every single day in the form of his computer. <br>

 And while I'm at it, I 
should absolutely plug Apple's superbEducation program. They actually care 
about education, simply put. They know how frustrating technology can be for 
teachers, but realize how today's kids are growing up asdigital kids. <br>
<br>

They're revolutionizingschool administration solutions. They're providing and 
empowering teachers withnew and innovative ways for teaching (using the iLife 
suite, for one). And they're paving the way for1 to 1 Learning -- that is, one 
computer to one kid. They're honoring teachers, not only by providing them with 
technology that they can<em>use</em> during class, but by recognizing and 
respecting successful teaching.<br>
<br>
It's little wonder they keeping 
winning awards for excellence in Technology &amp; Learning. <br>

<p>OK, I've just moved from 83% PC and 17% Mac to 81.6 PC to 18.4% Mac - and 
that's a big move!&nbsp; Earlier today I was at 82.3% PC and 18.7% Mac.&nbsp; 
I'm moving, slowly, but steadily.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I think &quot;Jedi&quot; has talked me into Panther. I was generously 
donated a G4 PowerMac by a friend trying to 'convert' me and I must say I have 
been amazed so far.&nbsp; I had NO software installed on it, and all you can do 
just with a 'plain' 'ol Mac is amazing.&nbsp; Then I installedIlumina Gold, 
(website currently down) and am enjoying that.&nbsp; I just got my AppleWorks 
today and will install as soon as I get home.</p> 
<p>I must say, that I have found the Mac to very easy, natural, and 
integrated, but I have to admit, it does seem a bit slow, and all the pastels 
is kinda annoying, gimmie some REAL colors, like RED, BLUE, YELLOW, not all 
this light pinkie stuff.&nbsp; But I do like the ease of how everything 
works.&nbsp; A lot of stuff you can do on the web is built intot he Mac, and I 
haven't even looked at iPhoto or iMovie, because I don't have any photos or 
movies yet. I still have a hard time imagining leaving PC due to all the 
programs I have that Mac doesn't - but I can always have a PC desktop for that 
stuff - I don't know - hard to change - I am a short-cuts whiz and am really 
fast on a PC, but, ok, I'll move to 79.7% PC and 20.3% Mac.</p> <br>

<p>Yes the mac has nice toys, but you can get the same toys and do the same 
things with a PC.&nbsp; The funny thing is that it is difficult to excange 
files from Mac to PC.&nbsp; Now about 99.9% of the world uses the PC (yes 
sometimes&nbsp;a million flys can be right) so this causes some problems.&nbsp; 
You can convert some files from Mac to PC but not all and sometimes the files 
don't even look the same when you convert them.</p> 
<p>What appears to be happening is you were just bought by the Apple people. 
&nbsp; Pc people know they have a good product, thus don't have to buy our 
users.</p> 
<p>What is fun is attempting to get parts for Mac or if you need a tech type 
person finding one that is willing to work on Mac.&nbsp; I just spent 2 days 
searching for a G3 power supply.&nbsp; Then I had to open the thing and install 
it.&nbsp; I washed my hands several times after playing with the fruit.&nbsp;
&nbsp; I then told my boss that if I must play with fruit I would need more 
time off or more money.</p> 
<p>Have fun with your fruit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>btw, I like the orginal sin thing, think I will use it Monday.</p> <br>

 Uh, oh, now I'm in trouble! <br>
<br>
Though I did just 
dig in and get Panther. <br>
<br>
I agree with Kevin, that you can do anything 
on a PC, even more, and translation is limited between the two, but I must 
admit this, I've no problems with the Mac setting it up (that weren't a part of 
my Mac-ignorance) and it was set up literally in a few minutes, whereas when I 
have to re-do my PC, which is about every 6 months, it takes a 12 hour day to 
get it back to where everything is installed and set up.<br>
<br>
PC get 
cluttered and slow very quickly, and I have a state-of-the-art laptop, and it 
takes three minutes to boot up (so I hibernate 95% of the time, which works 
great in XP now)<br>
<br>
Question for Mac-lovers - HONESTLY - what is the 
maintenanc of a Mac? Do you have to defrag? How often do you have to re-do your 
system? I have to re-do my PC every 3-6 months due to it getting slow and 
cumbersome, and I have tech problems weekly, probably 3-4 hours a week is 
wasted on tech support, and PC tech support is as lame as any - people reading 
manuals to me on the phone, I know more usually than the tech support rep I 
get! I usually end up explaining it to them, and hang up more frustrated than 
before I placed the call. I think the real tech quizes don't work for tech 
support? Not sure, but I've never gotten a tech support rep that knew more than 
me, and its not like I'm a super techie guy, I'm really not. I'm a power-user, 
but not a techno-whiz.<br>
<br>
Macs are expensive, that is another down-side, 
yet when you look at all the included software that comes included that costs 
extra on PC, it really balances it out.<br>
<br>
Keep the argument, er, 
conversation going! I am learning a lot! <br>

 That's funny, Kevin -- 
I've not had a<em>single</em> of your problems. And, mind you, I'm still forced 
to use PCs frequently at school and on a few other occassions. (That's not to 
mention people still ask me to play Tech Support for PCs. ) <br>
<br>
And I 
don't exactly understand what you mean by it being difficult to exchange files. 
The<em>only</em> problem I've had to date with file inter-operability has been 
when a friend tried sending an .AVI of something he ripped off TV; it was 
encoded in some very rare, funky codec. It wouldn't even work on two other PCs. 
But everything else -- you name the file -- I haven't had problems with it. In 
fact, I often keep a lot of my personal documents on my USB memory stick and I 
can easily unplug it from my Mac, plug it into any PC (well, any PC with WinXP, 
since nothing else has the drivers built in -- not so with Macs, they'll just 
go with it), and all of my files are there and I can open them all seamlessly. 
These are my most<em>personal</em>, absolutely necessary documents, mind you -- 
and not a single problem. (Well, I can't say that: WinXP does seem to clutter 
the stick with temporary file folders/images and &quot;.ds_&quot; copies of 
whatever I open -- it's just bizarre, but then it's Windows.) <br>
<br>
<em>
*Shrugs*</em> <br>
<br>
I've also successfully plugged my Mac into many 
networks, without a hitch whatsoever. (Actually, I think all of them were 
Windows-only networks too.) Plug the network cable in, Mac really does take 
care of the rest -- and in a matter of 30 seconds, you're on the network. I 
haven't even had that kind of luck getting PCs running on networks -- and I'd 
like to think I've had lots of experience, as I'm one of the few all-around 
tech support dudes at school.<br>
<br>
You might have me on the parts: I'll 
admit that, for the average consumer, it might be difficult to find parts. They
<em>are</em> available -- there's dozens of very nice online Mac sites that 
have comprehensive inventories of all the parts you could need. It just takes a 
re-orientation of your computing mindset. And, if I just skim the phone book I 
can easily find half a dozen tech support peoples and businesses that work on 
Apples.<br>
<br>
Then there's Apple's <strong>excellent</strong> tech support. 
I've had to make one single call to tech support before; a week or so after I 
got my G4, I decided I was smart enough to play with the system files and 
inadvertently messed something up. (I was messing with them like I need to mess 
with Windows system files, but realized it didn't need messing with.) One call 
to tech support and less than an hour later, the problem was fixed and good as 
new. I was surprised; no annoying background music, not even 30 seconds of 
waiting, and &quot;Bob&quot; knew exactly what the problem was as I described 
it (rather poorly at that) and knew exactly how to fix it. They're #1 in tech 
support, three years running! Wahoo! <br>
<br>
<strong>Edit: A response to 
maintenance question...</strong> <br>
<br>
I was really surprised at how <em>
little</em> maintenance my Mac requires. It IS a computer, so yes -- it DOES 
have computer problems occassionally and requires maintenance, but it's all so 
very simple and easy.<br>
<br>
The thing to understand is OS X is built upon a 
UNIX-core; it's built to naturally take care of itself. The only thing you 
should have to do is every week or so check the permissions on your boot 
harddrive. (You simply open Disk Utility in the Application/Utilities folder, 
select your harddrive, and hit Repair Disk Permissions.) It takes on average 
two minutes to run its course on my computer, and I'm more than welcome to surf 
the net, listen to iTunes, and anything else I might want while it does that.
<br> <br>
There's also one more thing that I do every other week or so, but I 
think the Panther upgrade rendered it superfluous, so technically I don't even 
need to. OS X is based on UNIX, as I said, and UNIX was designed to run 24/7, 
mainly as processing computers. Thus, they programmed the operating system to 
take care of itself, running a program every night in the wee hours of the 
morning. Now, since most of us don't have our computers running in the wee 
hours of the morning, we usually have to tell it to do that maintenance 
ourself. I use a program called MacJanitor, which I just run -- hit a button 
for it to perform its duties, then leave it running in the background. (It also 
takes a fair minute or two.) Since Panther, though, I don't even need to do 
this step anymore; even though I do out of habit.<br>
<br>
And that's that. All 
in all, 4 or 5 minutes of maintenance every week or so and you're set. It runs 
like it did on Day 1, when I took it out of the box; even better, actually.<br>

<br>Oh, and I have yet to &quot;redo&quot; my Mac. I have yet to reformat any 
of my harddrives, or do a system-wide purge just to get it running smoothly 
again, in the 10 months I've had it. My PC friends seem to be reformatting 
every other week, but no problems here. <br>

 I have to agree 
with jedi some here, I just plugged in the mac to my home network and BOOM i 
was online, no settings to do or anything, and it is a secure network too. (?)
<br> <br>
also, I plugged in my external USB backup drive - BOOM an icon for it 
appeared on the desk top. I copied all my files over so i could play with them.
<br> <br>
Word docs open fine. images too. I got deal on AppleWorks 6 and it is 
opening my word docs fine. I should get Word x but don't wanna spend too much 
just yet! Already got iLife and Panther coming!<br>
<br>
The only things I'm 
not liking about Mac is the lack of keyboard shortcuts I am very used to, but 
I'm sure they are there, just have to relearn them. (like hitting a letter and 
having the highlight jump to files/folders starting with that letter, and the 
control-arrows for skipping by word, and home and end being beginning and end 
of line, and control-home/end being beginning end of sentence, and a few other 
little things like that) <br>

I know you were teasing, and your quote was 
followed by a wink, but just for the record, since the donor will most 
certainly read this in time, I wasn't being 'bought' - someone generously 
donated a G4 to Kidology. My personal interest aside, we are happy to have a 
Mac so that we can make sure that our Mac members and friends have a good 
experience on Kidology.org Occasionally, we have had pages that didn't view (or 
view well) on Macs and I'm glad we now can test things on a Mac rather than 
wait for a Mac user to complain. The problem isn't the Macs, it is usually the 
HTML. Similar to testing with Netscape (lets not get THAT argument going!) and 
other browsers. So all teasing aside, its not a bribe, it is a awesome gift we 
are very thankful for regardless of the fun debate I opened with this 'can of 
worms.&quot; :) <br>

<p>Yes I was joking!</p> 
<p>To be fully honest if someone gave me a G4 I would use it for movie and 
graphic type applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes it is a very awesome gift and 
will expand your ministry.&nbsp; Sorry if I caused any difficulties, just 
having fun.</p>

MacFans would still like you. :)</p>

 Hey, he did say biased opinions are welcome, 
and boy -- do we got 'em. <br>
<br>
I do have to admit I'm a little bit 
disappointed that developers simply don't develop for Mac too often. There's a 
few games I miss playing anymore, and I'm always frustrated when I stick in a 
DVD and can't play the DVD-ROM special features. (Arrgh.) Then there's the 
small, ministry-based applications that get developed, but only for PC. <br>

<br>So no, I wouldn't even try to run a ministry without a PC... as much as I'd 
like to say I could live my whole life with just Apple, I'd be extremely 
foolhardy to try. <br>

<p>What I don't get is why someone has not made it so you can easily trade 
files from Mac to Pc and Pc to Mac.&nbsp; We also should be able to set up and 
run either Mac or Pc applications.</p> 
<p>I would think it would be somewhat easy.&nbsp; You should be able to set up 
a dual boot system.&nbsp; One hard drive formated Mac and the other drive 
formated PC.&nbsp; Thus you would have the best of both worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now 
throw in Linux and Unix into the mess like I have at work and now no one wants 
to share or talk to each other.&nbsp; Somewhat like a bad day with 
pre-schoolers.</p> 
<p>I do like the Mac case, they open easy and everything is easy to get 
to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mac Tech support is good and still in the USA so I don't have 
to fight the language issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Until the day when Mac and PC are interchangable we will just have to have 
two computers to do many jobs correctly.</p> <br>

Hehee, but at least 
computers don't shove crayons up their (or worse, your) nose. <br>
<br>
Well, 
there<em>is</em> sort of a way to have a dual boot system. Microsoft has put out
VirtualPC for Mac -- essentially allowing you to emulate a PC/Windows XP on 
your Mac. You can run PC programs, access PC networks, share PC files -- the 
works.<br>
<br>
I can't vouch for it personally, as I find it rather expensive 
and can't spare the dough. But I do know people who swear by it (tsk, shame on 
them!), so I figure it can't hurt owning it. The only thing you <strong>can't
</strong> do with it, I believe, is play certain Windows games through it. <br>

<br>Come to think of it, I should try it out some time; see if it'll run all 
those Windows-only ministry apps that I need to survive. <br>

<p>Dude, I love you!&nbsp; You just made my life 100% easier, thus I can go to 
my office and do nerd things.&nbsp; You know drink coffee and play quake ha-ha.
</p> 
<p>I will have my boss buy it (if she will) and if it works I'll let you know, 
so hold on to your dough for now.</p>

 Hehe, Quake is a pretty 
popular game that's been around a few years; its renowned for providing tech 
support types with plenty of entertainment in desparaging moments of boredom, 
when there's no support-ish stuff to do. <br>
<br>
Pretty fun. Ah, but Karl, I 
do think your ticker should be a little more over to the apple side of things. 
Say, 57.4%/42.6% in Mac's favor? <br>

 OK, anyone ever 
heard of: ThinkFree software?<br>
<br>
http://www.thinkfree.com/ <br>
<br>
I 
downloaded the demo, seems pretty cool, and opens my Word docs better than 
AppleWorks, and is only $49 compaired to $200+ for Word X from Billgatesinc.<br>
<br>Also, it says that it is Word or Mac compatible, and you share files via 
the Internet, much like .Mac it seems, anyway, Jedi or anyone else, ever used 
it? <br>
