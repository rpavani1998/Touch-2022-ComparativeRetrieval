 Is this the latest version of 
AUDIOLINK II USB AUDIO INTERFACE FOR PC, MAC, IPAD? <br>
 Is AUDIOLINK II USB 
AUDIO INTERFACE FOR PC, MAC, IPAD in stock?  Manufacturer: MIDITECH <br>

Platform: Hybrid  Includes both a Mac and Windows version of the program. <br>

<br> <br>

<p>  Need to connect mics, guitars or line level devices such as keyboards, 
mixers or tape decks to your computer? The AudioLink USB is the perfect choice! 
With switchable phantom power, you can connect dynamic or condenser microphones 
to the XLR or 1/4&quot; input. Use the Hi-Z connection for a guitar or bass, 
and connect line level devices through the RCA in/outs on the back. Both the 
mic and guitar inputs have gain level dials, making it easy to control your 
levels without having to use your mouse! The adjustable headphone out is 
perfect for monitoring your mix. The built in hardware reverb makes it easy to 
add effects without taxing your CPU. &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
As a class 
compliant audio interface, you can connect the AudioLink USB to your Mac OS X, 
Windows 7, Windows Vista (32 or 64 bit) or Windows XP machine and start 
recording right away - no need to install drivers. (Unless, of course, you wish 
to use the low latency ASIO drivers, which are included on the CD-ROM.) &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;<br>
Samplitude 11 Silver license (Windows XP, Vista, 7) is included 
so you can start recording right away! (Download required, instructions 
included.) &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
The AudioLink II will also work with an iPad 
when connected through the Apple Camera Connection Kit. You can then connect 
microphones, guitars or line level devices (keyboards, tape decks, CD players, 
etc) and record directly to your iPad! You can also use the AudioLink for 
playback from your iPad (It may require a 5v power supply (not included) as 
some iPads do not provide enough power to the AudioLink.) &nbsp;<br>
