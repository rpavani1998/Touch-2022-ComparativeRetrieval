<p>Most people I know that own a Mac tell me how much better they are than 
PCs, yet plenty of PC owners are hesitant about making the switch, or happily 
maintain that there are benefits to working with a PC.</p> 
<p>There were a number of<strong> ad campaigns</strong>&nbsp;brought out by 
Apple both in America and in the UK, wittily highlighting the advantages of a 
Mac over a PC. Understandably, these reflected a corporate marketing message 
(the fun versus the staid and boring), and PCs hardly came off well.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of defences for choosing a PC over a Mac, and for many 
people, these will be sufficient to deter them from switching over to the Apple 
side of the fence. As always, there are two sides to every argument.</p> 
<h2>Reasons to love a Mac</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;the sleek and simplistic design looks great</p> 
<p>&hellip;it works well with other Apple products</p> 
<p>&hellip;you can run Windows alongside Mac OS X using Boot Camp</p> 
<p>&hellip;there are fewer Mac-targeting viruses (<strong>although they do now 
exist</strong>)</p> 
<p>&hellip;if you have any problems, it&rsquo;s simple to call Applecare</p> 
<p>&hellip;the software is slick and simple to use</p> </blockquote> 
<h2>Reasons to love a PC</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;it&rsquo;s fully customisable</p> 
<p>&hellip;there&rsquo;s a wide support system available</p> 
<p>&hellip;there are stylish <strong>ultrabooks</strong> to choose from these 
days</p> 
<p>&hellip;you can easily upgrade components</p> 
<p>&hellip;there&rsquo;s a wide range of software available</p> 
<p>&hellip;you can easily find cheap laptop PCs</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But how about those who have experienced both technologies, and have 
switched from PC to Mac? Or even &ndash; whisper it &ndash; switched from Mac 
to PC?</p> 
<p>Have <strong>you</strong> switched? And if so, how long did it take to 
adapt, and what was the hardest part of the transition for you?</p> 
<p>Lastly, can you share any advice with people who might be considering 
changing either from a Windows PC to a Mac or from a Mac to a PC?</p>

<p>Having switched from PC to MAC some 10 years ago, I can say that total cost 
of ownership of MAC is less than PC. The quality of support you get from Apple 
is a lot better than from PC suppers. the amount of times i have had things 
done for nothing by Apple (when they didn&rsquo;t need to) is incredible. The 
reliability of applications is better. Cost of applications is generally less 
on MAC, unless you buy from Microsoft apps.<br>
 General usability is better on 
MAC.</p>

<p>Re &ldquo;had things done for nothing by Apple (when they didn&rsquo;t need 
to) is incredible&rdquo;. I know exactly what you mean. It is terrible when a 
company forces you to upgrade, or locks you in to Apple products.</p> 
<p>Perhaps this article would be better phrased considering a switch from Mac+ 
PC -&gt; GNU/Linux distros like Ubuntu?</p>

<p>I swapped from PC to Mac a couple of years ago (with the second generation 
of intel Macs) and I have to admit that I&rsquo;ve never looked back. Since 
then, I&rsquo;ve bought a Macbook (as has my partner). I think the biggest 
selling point for me is using a Mac with OS X, Apple&rsquo;s operating system. 
Since the hardware and software have been designed by the same company and with 
each other in mind, it has produced a system (in my experience) that is 
incredibly robust, doesn&rsquo;t crash and can upgrade itself with little or no 
impact on my daily work.<br>
 I can see why people are concerned about the 
initial cost of a Mac but in my years of buying and owning PCs, I&rsquo;ve 
discovered that you get what you pay for. The Mac tends to be built with decent 
quality components and if you were to buy a similarly spec&rsquo;d PC, the 
difference in price gets much less.<br>
 The other concern that people have is 
a perceived lack of software for the Mac. I have both MS office and 
Apple&rsquo;s equivalent suite of software (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) and can 
happily use either. MS office does have some compatible issues with PC versions 
(so when you work on something at home and take it to work you can lose 
formatting etc.) but I&rsquo;ve found that happens between different versions 
of MS Office running under different versions of windows.<br>
 Admittedly there 
are a lack of games that run on OS X but I have run quite demanding software 
under Windows using Bootcamp (which comes with every Mac) and it seems fine so 
far.</p> 
<p>So all in all, I&rsquo;m fully in the Mac camp and happy to stay there for 
the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>We are a wholly mac household: iMac; Macpro, 2 x MacBooks, mac mini. Our 
teenage rock band sons use them to make music. OK, you can do this on PC, but 
it&rsquo;s better on Mac. Partner and I use MS Office as part of our jobs 
(can&rsquo;t avoid it really). Son and I have iPhones which are synced with 
address book, email, calendar. It all works well. Not cheap though.</p> 
<p>PLUS, (and this is naughty) I have made a Hackintosh which works fine and 
is 60% of the cost of an equivalent mac. It is legal, but you have to be a bit 
of a nerd to follow through on the instructions. Luckily, I am.</p> 
<p>Can&rsquo;t conceive of going back to Windoze. </p>

<p>I started switching from a PC to a Mac in 2001. In my business most 
programs were PC based so I could only switch the web browsing, word-processing 
and spreadsheet work across. I now run the couple of PC only programs in a 
window on the mac using a mac program called parallels so have the best of both 
worlds.<br>
 It took me about 10 days to get used to the mac operating system, 
no time to get used to &lsquo;Word and Excel&rsquo; as they are virtually the 
same. The hardest part of the transition was convincing my wife who had just 
completed an ECDL course on a PC so didn&rsquo;t want to start again.<br>
 
Advice if switching from a PC to a Mac: The time saved not messing about with 
errors will more than make up for the extra cost of the Mac.<br>
 Advice 
switching from Mac to PC (if forced to do due to work circumstances as happened 
to me once): Keep calm, keep it simple with a minimum of &lsquo;add ons&rsquo;, 
make friends with the PC technician and eventually get a new job if you can.</p>

<p>I started with a Dell + Microsoft Windows. I found the help wizard totally 
incomprehensible using computer language which was double dutch. On the advice 
of a friend, I switched to a MAC laptop, and have been able to teach myself to 
Email, download my photos and send them, browse the internet, write letters 
etc. My usage is simple, and I have always found Mac help understandable. I 
might even progress to more sophisticated uses.</p>

<p>DW makes an interesting point: Mac OSX is better for both novices (as 
he/she implies) and advanced users (like me). MS Windows has had 20 years to 
get the techy bits right, like connecting to the internet and those pesky 
wizards. But within ten seconds, it&rsquo;s down to the bits and bites which, 
while OK-ish for me, must bamboozle 90% of users. (I&rsquo;m not being a 
show-off here. I have a degree in computer science, albeit a loooong time ago).

<p>I swapped to Mac at home six years ago. It was a bit strange at first, the 
best way to get people to understand is to describe it as driving a left hand 
drive car. It&rsquo;s the same but different&hellip;. I find the applications 
are easier to use and just, well nicer. Stability is far better. My Mac&rsquo;s 
(I have two now) hardly ever crash and if an application does go wrong and 
closes, only that program shuts down, not the whole system. And finally, the 
clincher, although considerably more expensive to buy, they seem to last 
longer. Mine have been faultless which is why they are still in service. I have 
friends who have much older Macs that they are still using. Two of my previous 
PC&rsquo;s failed dramatically, one at 14 months and one at 37 months. Guess 
how long the warranties were? Just do it! Make the change and you won&rsquo;t 
regret it once you get used to it.</p>

<p>After 25 years working in IT I pretty much knew everything there was to 
know about PC&rsquo;s. Then I bought a mac and I was totally knocked out by it. 
You plug in a new printer &ndash; the mac recognises it instantly; set up a new 
wireless network &ndash; the mac instantly asks if you want to join to it. It 
really could not get any better. Our houselhold is now entirely mac &ndash; 2 
iMacs, 2 Macbooks, iPad, 2 iPhones. And with four different printers, three 
scanners, wifi stereo system everything works seemlessly together. I know PC 
users will be very sceptical but it&rsquo;s true: with Apple, not only does it 
look great but &lsquo;it just works&rsquo; too.</p>

<p>I bought a new Acer PC when the new Vista came out a few years ago as our 
Mac was getting to be incompatible with newer software, The PC has been an 
irritation to use ever since. The various applications don&rsquo;t synchronise 
together properly like those on a Mac and I am frequently interrupted by 
messages and prompts for updates for some application other than the one 
I&rsquo;m trying to use. I regularly find myself swearing at the PC &ndash; 
this didn&rsquo;t happen with the Mac!</p>

<p>I use an iMac at work and need to use Windows and Mac OS-X for development.
<br> The Mac hardware is excellent and screen superb; if you&rsquo;re prepared 
to pay the premium for it. You can pretty much find all the apps you need on 
both platforms. I like both but I prefer Windows 7 to Mac OS-X for the 
following reasons that may seem trivial but affect your everyday usage in 
subtle ways:<br>
 1. The Mac UK keyboard is a US keyboard with the &pound; key 
instead of the $ key &ndash; if you have other PC&rsquo;s to use you spent time 
searching for # and \ all the time.<br>
 2. The mouse doesn&rsquo;t move fast 
enough and decelerates towards window corners in OS-X. You can disable the 
deceleration but I can&rsquo;t get the mouse as fast as Windows without paying 
for additional software.<br>
 3. Home and End operate differently in OS-X and 
Windows, Linux etc..<br>
 4. You can&rsquo;t delete a file by hitting delete 
&ndash; you have to use the mouse.<br>
 All trivial I know but it gave me RSI.

<p>Strange stuff! All my Mac keyboards have &pound; and $ and the \. 
Admittedly, the hash needs to be got from a character palette. My mouses are 
naturally as fast as I set them to be in system preferences, no idea what 
Andrew J is on about. Mine whizzes across the screen with no deceleration.<br>
 
Mac users, admittedly, have to gradually learn some geeky stuff which is a bit 
annoying, because it&rsquo;s not obvious. E.g. to delete a file as Andrew J 
wants, you can&rsquo;t press &ldquo;delete&rdquo;, you have to press command + 
delete. Also, the Mac keyboard has no forward delete button. It took me ages to 
find out that you can do this by pressing function + delete. Also the Mac 
&ndash; bizarrely &ndash; can&rsquo;t just maximise a window like the PC 
(although there is additional software, Cinch, that can fill that gap). But 
despite its little flaws Macs save me all the hassle of antivirus, anti spam, 
anti adware, registry cleaning and all the other time wasting PC users have to 
spend their days with. I&rsquo;ve never yet needed software that didn&rsquo;t 
exist for the Mac. Macs just work. I&rsquo;d never ever ever want to go back to 
PCs. Amen.</p>

<p>I switched to an iMac about year ago and only wished I&rsquo;d done sooner. 
I nearly did it 10 years ago and was persuaded by a well meaning friend that I 
was probably too old to cope with how different it was!<br>
 All I can say is 
that even though I am now officially an OAP I have not found it that difficult. 
Several months in I also discovered Mac 1 to 1 which you can purchase for 
&pound;79.99 which has got to be one of my best buys ever. I go in on an almost 
weekly basis to my local store and have an hour&rsquo;s 1to1 with one of their 
trainers and have learnt how to do all kinds of things I had never dreamed of. 
They also help with personal projects and it also includes small group 
workshops which I have really enjoyed. I now also own an iPad and an iTouch and 
they sync like a dream. I&rsquo;ve given away my windows laptop and there is 
absolutely nothing that would persuade me back to microsoft.</p>

<p>For an OAP, you really write like a US-based marketing exec. What OAP 
writes &ldquo;several months in&rdquo; , &ldquo;local store&rdquo; , &ldquo;you 
can purchase for &pound;79.99&Prime; , &ldquo;the kind of things I had never 
dreamed of&rdquo; and &ldquo;sync like a dream&rdquo;. Come clean, you work for 
Apple, don&rsquo;t you? If I&rsquo;m wrong, I apologise and suggest you get a 
job copywriting.</p>

<p>If you want you can run most Windows apps on a Mac (not MAC pls!) because 
you can run a windows emulator&hellip;. if you only want a few windows apps 
then it&rsquo;s a realistic solution. Crossover Mac also allows many PC apps to 
run on Macs without needing to install Windows itself. Serious/hardcore gamers 
are one of the main groups who&rsquo;d probably be happier with a PC.<br>
 ps 
can you tell us what FSX is and why anyone needs it- cheers? Can you run iMovie

<p>Yes you can run FSX on a Mac, just as you can run Windows on a Mac, though 
having had to use Windows at work, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d want to 
even though it is better than it used to be. But why not use X-Plane 10, a far 
better simulator and available on both platforms?</p>

<p>I always said I didn&rsquo;t need a computer nor did I want one. However I 
had to work towards a teaching qualification and handwriting assignments was a 
huge chore- I didn&rsquo;t want a Desk top so 5 researched Lap tops via Which 
magazine and decided on an Apple. Which I bought from John Lewis who told me 
about the help I could get at the Apple store so I bought an annual 
subscription and in my first year went every week for lessons. This was the 
very best way to get to know the computer and I have kept up the subscription 
and now only get help when I need it. The staff are SO helpful and have 
infinite patience. This has made my computer experience very enjoyable and the 
computer in 5 years has NEVER let me down. Plus the Time Machine is a real 
star!! I&rsquo;m sure I could have got all the help with a Desktop but being 
able to take my computer up to the Apple store for lessons and help is just 
amazing.</p>

<p>The huge advantage is that Apple control everything. Some don&rsquo;t like 
that, but it does produce reliable goods that way. e.g.: Apple make the 
computer, the operating system, the software, and control the interfaces with 
other devices. They know exactly what is going to be used with what and that 
largely is why everything just works with no conflicts. Secondly, the design of 
the operating system doesn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t give viruses permission to 
hurt it. So simple! It&rsquo;s also based on a unix OS rather than a centuries 
old botch pitch of windows DOS.</p>

<p>I think you will find that a lot of Apple devices are made by other 
companies, the same as a PC. They make the Apple badge however.</p> 
<p>Apple have been taking Samsung to court lately for theft of iPAD technology 
etc (and Samsung have sued Apple for other things). This is interesting when 
more than half of the ipad is made by Samsung.</p> 
<p>Many years ago, my nephew and niece wanted an ipod. My niece wanted the 
light pink. They were over a &pound;100 each, and I could not afford them. I 
bought much cheaper (&pound;25) items from Taiwan (via EBay). My niece got a 
HOT Pink version, which could play all the music of the Ipod and also play 
videos, which Apple&rsquo;s product could not. The following year, Apple 
introduced the NEW iPod, which could play video and, you guessed it, came in 
HOT Pink.</p> 
<p>Aple used to be innovators. It is a shame they lost the war to be the 
universal device, as they were better than the intel/Microsoft collaboration. 
Now all they do is copy.</p> 
<p>Look on Amazon reviews for printers and scanners and many other devices. 
Most reviews are positive, except the few who say, &ldquo;It wont work with my 
MAC and the Epson (or whowever) tech support don&rsquo;t understand MACS.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Maybe the world would be a better place if Apple had won the war in the 
Eighties. But here and now, Windows is the ONLY Choice. No, wait, it is not. 
You can have a Dell windows PC, or a Packard Bell PC, or an Acer, or Asus, or 
IBM or SONY, or&hellip;.</p> 
<p>You can buy a MAC and use a windows emulator. Why not just buy a PC? You do 
not hear of PC users wanting a MAC emulator! A MAC running a word processor 
package may be better, faster, more reliable than a PC, but a Mac emulating a 
PC is going to be RUBBISH by comparison.</p> 
<p>I have several programs which only work on PC&rsquo;s. There is a 
possibility in years to come that they may be developed for Android, but fruity 
versions? No.</p>

<p>Apple = Over-priced, Microsoft = Over-bloated. I gave up on the pair of 
them a couple of years ago because of the ever upwards spiralling cost. 
I&rsquo;m a silver surfer who doesn&rsquo;t need an overtly technical computer 
to chat to friends, write emails, use LibreOffice (Open Source) Office Suite, 
play music, watch movies and a host of other things. What do I use? Linux 
Ubuntu! because It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s user friendly, all the programs are 
free, it&rsquo;s secure and I don&rsquo;t get viruses or the dreaded blue 
screens. As a pensioner, I cannot spend any more money than necessary on 
expensive Microsoft or Apple Mac upgrades or antivirus software. Any pensioner 
reading this take note. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on the greedy big two. 98% 
of pensioners do not need to spend a fortune to enjoy the www &hellip; do 
yourself a favour, go Linux Ubuntu or one of the Linux other flavours, you

won&rsquo;t be going back to Windows. I don&rsquo;t know how it compares with 
the Mac, but it certainly impressed me with the clarity and speed of use.</p>

<p>I have switched from PC to Mac a couple of years ago and have just switched 
back from Mac to Windows 7. I would draw a distinction between Windows 7 and 
previous versions, it is much better.<br>
 The Mac is undeniably good quality, 
for the money it should be. The software is not always easy to use, options are 
hidden under system preferences, under right click menus (you do not know it is 
there until you right click) or even worse under right click and hold. I have 
experience incompatibilities between the Mac and different routers (a variety 
of PC versions all worked without trouble). The spreadsheet has performance 
issues for quite small amounts of data. If you are attaching an item to an 
email and double click in the wrong place the system starts preparing an 
attachment around 50GB in size and you can do nothing with the system until it 
decides to give up. The Mac does not work with my digital camera, all PCs in 
the house do. There are issues with content in iphoto shared between different 
users, maybe I have it set up wrong but hang on, this stuff is supposed to be 
easy to use. Being an open rather than closed technology PCs are more likely to 
work with any device you plug in or attachment you try to open. On a Mac you 
have to download stuff like tnefDD just to open attachments sent in certain 
formats from a PC.</p> 
<p>Mac support is well organised but I have had issues they cannot fix. There 
is a PC man who lives a few streets away who has fixed the handful of PC issues 
I could not fix myself, at a very reasonably cost.</p> 
<p>Is the Mac better than PC running Windows 7, not for me. I think there is a 
fundamental cognitive bias at play in reviews &ndash; if people have paid a lot 
for a product they are likely to rate it highly as no one likes to admit they 
bought the wrong thing. I paid a lot of money for a Mac, it wasn&rsquo;t the 
right decision for me so I sold it on. One very good thing about Macs is that 
they maintain a lot of their value when sold secondhand.</p>

<p>I was brought up in a pc environment but have used both pc and mac for the 
last 10 years. I find macs too restrictive in what they allow you to do whereas 
pcs you can play with so much more (as neither a novice or a pro but somewhere 
in between). I feel that I&rsquo;m dictated to by apple whereas I&rsquo;m 
allowed more free rein to break my pc! At home I run a pc for all my 
&lsquo;serious&rsquo; stuff but use iPhones and iPads linked into it because I 
like the design of them. When working in a design house I found that all the 
artists raved about macs (but this seemed to be for design and simplicity 
reasons rather than good for the job) but they&rsquo;d never used a pc. Mac 
owners to me can seem a bit sold into the mac lifestyle rather than having 
logical reasons. However, if you want something that looks cool, is easy to use 
and you&rsquo;re not fussed about being dictated to by apple go for a mac. If 
you want to think you&rsquo;re an individual with the impression of free will 
go for a pc!</p>

<p>Ps my latest pc is, in my opinion, smarter looking than an iMac as its all 
built into the monitor and doesn&rsquo;t scream &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be

<p>We switched to Macs about 8 years ago. Between us my wife and I now own a 
Macbook, a Macbook Pro, an iphone and two ipads. We did buy a small Windows 
machine about 2 years ago, because of the price difference, but it is no longer 
in use! While initially it took us a few months to get used to the Macs, we 
would not now go to Windows based machines again. I have used the Macs for 
professional, domestic and study purposes (at the OU) without any serious 
compatibility problems except when working for a short time with an 
international organization whose systems were entirely Windows based. However, 
I should note that I have had to resort to the Genius Bars (technical support 
units at Apple Stores) on a number of occasions. I would urge all to buy the 
extended guarantee that is on offer for Apple products. We have had to replace 
parts in all three Apple laptops within the three-year warranty period. This 
has not been as big an issue as it may sound since the quality of the service 
offered by the staff in the Genius Bars is excellent, and we live relatively 
close to an Apple store where we can go to seek help at very short notice. The 
easy access to support and repair services is another important reason why we 
will never revert to PCs.</p>

<p>I was persuaded to buy a MAC on the basis that using it was so much more 
instinctive than the PC experience. It came with the Leopard OS already loaded 
by the retailer. I already had a PC and had been using PCs for years. I did not 
take to the MAC&rsquo;s software which did not seem too instinctive to me and 
reverted to the PC. My wife was happy to use the MAC for surfing the net, 
emails and creating documents with a third-party office-like suite. The hard 
disc failed after a year after pretty light use but was replaced free-of-charge 
through the retailer. I subscribed to the Virus Barrier X5 software for two 
years. I believe this anti-virus software is sponsored by MAC. After the expiry 
of the second year I decided not to renew my subscription and downloaded Sophos 
anti virus free version from the internet. Despite not having had any virus 
warnings during the time I subscribed to Virus Barrier I started to get loads 
of virus warnings from it following my non-renewal of subscription. I got so 
bad that it effectively prevented the Sophos anti virus from scanning. I have 
now deleted the Virus Barrier software and Sophos now appears to work properly. 
There has been a lot of publicity lately about the Trojan Horse infecting MACs 
and Apple are issuing patches for the later OS systems but, apparently, not for 
the LEOPARD OS, which I have. To conclude, I can&rsquo;t recommend the MAC 
sponsored Virus Barrier software because I believe it was deliberately messing 
with my MAC after not renewing the subscription and nor am I pleased that Apple 
are not issuing a patch against Trojan Horses for older operating systems. I 
guess I can overlook the failed hard disc even if the replacement sounds a bit 
squeaky. Perhaps it&rsquo;s really a mouse. The screen definition is beautiful.

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am a Mac fan of over 20 years usage with 6 Macs 
and 2 Windows machines in the house. One of my irritations with Mac is their 
poor backwards compatibility. Basically older programs may no longer run due to 
hardware or OS improvements. For example old pre OSX software (which used to 
run in Classic) and PowerPC software (which used to run with Rosetta). Some of 
these have been decisions made by Apple in each new OSX release (probably to 
avoid the bloat that happens to Windows machines). You might have to upgrade or 
ditch your older software when you replace your hardware. This could leave you 
unable to access your old databases etc. Generally with Windows, stuff from 
more than a decade ago still runs on the latest hardware.</p>

<p>I go along with Ian&rsquo;s comment below: &ldquo;I think there is a 
fundamental cognitive bias at play in reviews. if people have paid a lot for a 
product (Apple) they are likely to rate it highly as no one likes to admit they 
bought the wrong thing&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>In my experience, people who buy Macs now are those who like the brand 
image and the look of the machines. The days when they were superior in any 
field (e.g. graphics, video editing, user interface, stability) are long gone. 
As Which? research shows, Macs do not last longer and are no more reliable than 
most machines designed for Windows. True, they are still less liable to malware 
attack, but that&rsquo;s not because OSX is better than Windows, it&rsquo;s 
because Windows users make a far tastier target because there are so many more 
of them.</p> 
<p>Many who think Macs are superior also think Apple make the best mobile. 
Anyone who knows their mobiles will tell you that that isn&rsquo;t true either. 
For example, only the latest iPhone 4S works properly as a phone because it has 
a decent antenna. Previous iPhones didn&rsquo;t, but most of the media and 
Apple sheep were happy to ignore it.</p> 
<p>Finally, if you do buy an Apple product, try not to ignore the ethical side:
<br> &ldquo;Not even the glorious design &hellip;could keep the 
&ldquo;cluster&rdquo; of suicides at the Apple supplier Foxconn&rsquo;s main 
manufacturing plant in Longhua (China) out of the news &hellip; Overtime in 
these factory cities is often forced &hellip; Apple pays just &pound;3.99 for 
the production of your &pound;600 iPhone&rdquo;.<br>

<p>Switched to an iMac about 4 years ago under guidance of eldest son and have 
never regretted it. At the beginning it took a few days and a few phone calls 
to my son to get used to it, but have never regretted changing. Everything is 
integrated and it &ldquo;just works&rdquo;. Have since bought a macbook for my 
wife who was so pleased to change from her Dell with Windows.<br>
 Yes Macs are 
more expensive BUT it is a relief to use a computer where things work and the

<p>Hi All,<br>
 I was for many years an anti apple customer,i would never ever 
look at their products but having going to a apple store every week while my 
wife goes shopping i decided to investigate ,with windows there a great machine 
but after a while they practically come to a halt,i learnt that if you buy an 
apple product for &pound;79 you get personal one to one training as much as you 
like for a year meaning you learn everything you need to know about any apple 
products,when you buy a window pc you take it home and that it,with apple pc 
you get a chance to learn the ins and out having done a course for a year now i 
admit I&rsquo;m familiar with the system i may take a second year course to 
learn more about them,i admit they are expensive but trust me once you move to 
apple there no going back i now have i iPhone i pad i mac and a mac book pro</p>

<p>I think that the one thing that has been missed is that Apple is, despite 
all the goodies it produces today, first and foremost a software company and 
builds computers to run its programmes. They had a disastrous experience, in 
the last decade of the last century, of licencing their Operating System for 
use on other manufacturer&rsquo;s computers and this I think proves a point 
that Microsoft maybe should have taken on board. If you control the 
environment, you can ensure that your software does what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>My first iMac served me well for 10 years and was only superseded because 
applications had grown as new versions were released, they became bloated, 
(Microsoft Word and Excel together with a Music Score writing programme) and so 
were running too slowly. An upgrade to the latest, at the time, iMac solved a 
lll concerns and is approaching its third anniversary, a time when the average 
Generic PC is reaching the end of its life. Hopefully it will last as long as 
the previous one which will represent very inexpensive computing.</p>

<p>I started with PCs in the early 90&prime;s, and struggled with the general 
disaster that was Windows until I eventually became so fed up with Windows that 
I looked at Macs in 2004/5, and I have never looked back. I am presently using 
OSX Snowleopard.</p> 
<p>Now there are some problems: I would agree that OSX is not quite as 
intuitive as Windows &ndash; oddly enough &ndash; and there are occasional 
hardware problems eg disc failures, but the reliability of the hardware is 
good, and OSX is so reliable &ndash; it almost never crashes or hangs up. I 
have a Windows 7 PC at work &ndash; and yes W7 is a sharp improvement on the 
previous versions &ndash; but I still have some crashes, hangs and so on 
&ndash; roughly weekly. MAC Problems almost always occur with microsoft based 
programmes &ndash; eg word. So now I have had two iMacs, and three laptops over 
the years, no viruses, and very few problems. And if you do have a problem 
&ndash; Applecare engineers almost always know what to do to fix a problem.</p> 
<p>Yes there is a premium to pay &ndash; but then I am not constantly 
tinkering with the PC, reinstalling Windows because it has gone wrong again, or 
struggling to set up a network that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p> 
<p>Change to MACs is not difficult, and under most circumstances, files are 
transferrable between the two &ndash; ie a Powerpoint written under OSX will 
display under W7 &ndash; although there may be some small formatting changes.

<p>I switched from PCs to an iMac two years ago because Microsoft was driving 
me bonkers. Like most people I want just a few basic applications but I want 
them to work reliably and straightforwardly. I don&rsquo;t want all the bells 
and whistles and the use of hundreds of programs. Microsoft PCs are clunky and 
erratic, continually give error messages and warnings in geeky, unintelligible 
coded language fit only for IT experts, and seem to crash all the time &mdash; 
Vista Home was dreadful, the old XP was almost OK in comparison. Hardware over 
two years old? Forget it.<br>
 Yes, the iMac does work straight from the box. 
It worked faultlessly with an otherwise redundant ten year old Epson scanner 
straightaway. Plug in any camera and it does everything for you. It&rsquo;s 
initially difficult to get used to but works much better once you master it; 
for instance Pages once learnt is streets ahead of Word. And Mac hardware is 
beautifully designed and built.<br>
 In summary, Microsoft/PCs are a gimmicky 
con; they may be cheaper but if you value your sanity go for a Mac, they 
aren&rsquo;t perfect but they&rsquo;re much more straightforward and nicer to 
use. PCs gave me a computer rage wobbly several times a day, the Macs (I now 
have the brilliant iPad2 which works beautifully with the iMac) upset me mildly 
about every other month, and it&rsquo;s mostly my fault. Enough said!</p>

<p>After several years on PCs of one form or another, many hours of my life 
just trying to actually keep them working, and the good fortune of a little 
spare extra cash I made the move to the first IMac and OSX about 10 years ago. 
Despite the extra initial cost and cost associated with acquiring a new set of 
software I have not once looked back. Mac and osx can be used like any good 
quality tool to do real work without loads of tinkering and generally propping 
up associated with windows and a very mixed bag of hardware that you find with 
pcs<br>
 From a design perspective macs make sense. Everything is designed to 
work together, hardware, software, and iTunes, app store etc &hellip;. And it 
does just that, and very reliably. I have left my Mac switched on for over a 
month with daily use (just putting to sleep when needed) and never in that time 
experienced a lockup or crash. Try doing that on windows!<br>
 I use pcs and 
windows / ms office every day at work and that environment is at long last much 
better than it was, however for reliability, quality and general end user 
experience / ease of use I still always choose Mac out of choice<br>
 Finally, 
where as once I was considered odd to make the Mac move I am now surrounded by 
very many who in the last year or so have made the very same move.</p>

<p>Surely it&rsquo;s horses for courses, and only one &ldquo;type&rdquo; of 
ser seems to have been represented. Now, I&rsquo;m a PC user, always have been. 
However I A) appreciate the asthetics of Macs, B) appreciate the innovation, 
and C) appreciate how robust (both physically and in terms of operation) they 
are. When my pensioner dad asked what computer he should buy, I recommended a 
Mac. It&rsquo;s operating system is easy to use, it &ldquo;just works&rdquo;, 
it looks nice in the house, and, most importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t throw up 
lot&rsquo;s of error messages which, like many old-school parents, he would 
read and try to understand. It&rsquo;s ideal for him.</p> 
<p>But crucially, not for everyone.</p> 
<p>For a start, when he asked for advice he threw in the crucial line 
&ldquo;money&rsquo;s no object&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s not forget I could pay 
&pound;700 for a good Dell or Acer Laptop and the equivalent Macbook Pro would 
be around &pound;1200. That&rsquo;s not &ldquo;a little more&rdquo;. Equally, I 
appreciate the &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make that back&rdquo; arguement, but only if 
you need the services Apple require, and only if you make your Mac last. For 
example, my dad has had his for years and being a Mac it&rsquo;s never broken, 
but equally he&rsquo;s never had to upgrade it as he only uses it for internet, 
email, and Office stuff. You try and Upgrade a Mac and you&rsquo;ll find that 
you ohave little scope to do it and it&rsquo;s again, very expensive.</p> 
<p>Lastly, you&rsquo;re locked in to Apple&rsquo;s way of thinking. Mostly 
this is great, but not always. For example, even my dad suffered at it:- He 
bought my mum an iPod for christmas, they plugged it in, it said it 
wasn&rsquo;t compatible with his version of iTunes, he should Download a newer 
version. he dowloaded it. iTunes said it wasn&rsquo;t compatible with his 
version of OSX. He went to upload a newer version of OSX as they were both OSX 
10 (10.44 to 10.5, I think), he couldn&rsquo;t. He had to buy it for &pound;70. 
Now you may say he should have checked, and yeah, maybe he should have, but it 
flies in the face of &ldquo;Apples just work.&rdquo; In my field of work, many 
of my colleagues use Final Cut Pro. It&rsquo;s not my editor of choice but 
don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s a brilliant programme that was even used 
to edit The Social Network. Well Apple have just &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; it. 
They decided they wanted to aim at the amateur market, making the new programme 
all but useless to the professionals. The old version is still great, but 
within 18months, it&rsquo;ll be dated useless. My colleagues are finding they 
have to spend about &pound;2000 and huge amounts of time utterly re-learning 
how to do their job. Why have Apple done this? Who knows. Like I say, 
that&rsquo;s Apple&rsquo;s philosophy; we make decisions, like it or lump it. 
And because of the lack of competition, you&rsquo;re stuck if you don&rsquo;t 
like it.</p> 
<p>For me, the very things that are advantages to my dad, are disadvantages to 
me. I&rsquo;m on a tighter budget and PCs aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;a bit 
cheaper&rdquo;. In some cases a Mac equivalent is 100% more! The fact that the 
OS is so robust on a Mac actually makes it much more difficult to get into it 
and make it do what I want. I use lots of powerful software (I&rsquo;m an 
editor), my PC is cheaper and easier to upgrade. If my dad&rsquo;s computer 
breaks, apple picks it up for him, fixes it, sends it back free of charge. 
Brilliant! But it&rsquo;s 5-10 working days, too long for me. When my PC breaks 
I can pop down my local computer store, get the parts, do it myself and be back 
up and running in a matter of hours. I need an awful lot of different 
programmes for an awful lot of tasks and PC offers a much wider variety and, 
because of that, better pricing.</p> 
<p>And I&rsquo;ve not even started on using them for games. Many on Which 
won&rsquo;t be interested, but that&rsquo;s not the point really. PCs are so 
much better because they&rsquo;re adaptable.</p> 
<p>Lastly, can I just say, the person that wrote &ldquo;Our teenage rock band 
sons use them to make music. OK, you can do this on PC, but it&rsquo;s better 
on Mac.&rdquo; is talking absolute nonsense. The music professional&rsquo;s 
choice, Pro Tools, is now designed and built on PCs. Up until about 5 years ago 
it was designed only for Macs, but because Apple annoyed the manufacturer 
(again with there &ldquo;our way or the high-way&rdquo; attitude) they moved to 
PC. Still available on Mac, but it&rsquo;s now a conversion. Garage band is a 
great wee fun tool, yes, but simply saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better on 
Mac&rdquo; is nonsense.</p> 
<p>So which is better? Neither! Ask yourself:<br>
 - What&rsquo;s your budget
<br> - What are you going to use it for<br>
 - Will these tasks require your 
computer to be upgraded in the near future<br>
 - Are you computer literate<br>

 - If you are, do you like your computer running &ldquo;just so&rdquo; and 
don&rsquo;t mind spending time doing that, or would you rather relinquish a bit 
control for solidity<br>
 - Do you have any other devices you&rsquo;d like to 
connect with. If so, what are they.</p> 
<p>Then get what you want. As long as you&rsquo;re happy and it does what you 
want, you&rsquo;ve bought the right one.</p>

<p>To be honest there is no huge difference between Macs and PCs when it comes 
to pure functionality, both will do just about anything you ask of them, so 
it&rsquo;s really just a matter of taste. If you think that caring about the 
minute details of how everything works and looks is pretentious and 
&ldquo;trying to be cool&rdquo;, then a PC is for you. If however you get 
pleasure from things that are designed with thought and care, then Macs are for 
you. You cannot buy a cheap Mac, but they are priced competitively with 
equivalent quality PCs, so price is not a big issue. The only other thing to 
consider is the ethics of the two companies. Apple are a big business operating 
in the notoriously unstable shark pool that is high tech, so they are no 
angels, except when you compare them to Microsoft. I don&rsquo;t have many 
moral scruples myself but have always tried to avoid buying anything from two 
companies, Microsoft and News Corp.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother with Linux unless you are knowledgeable and don&rsquo;t 
mind a fair amount of twiddling to get everything working.</p>

<p>I use a PC at work but a Mac at home but really find that a Mac can do more 
generally for design but it is easier to use in certain PC apps. I sometimes 
send work home with me because it will take half the time on my MAC than the 
PC! I agree that the cost is more for a Mac but they last a lot longer than 
other PCs and the service is great! Before I had a laptop which crashed twice 
when I was deployed or deploying and the company could not understand my 
urgency to get it fixed and it had to be sent out of the country! If you are 
learning to use a computer, I think that MACs are easier as they seem to be 
more logically set up. Waiting for everyone else to join me :)</p>

<p>I sit at a desk about 8 hours a day with a PC on the left and a MAC on the 
right. They are both pretty new and both about the same power. They were both 
best buys.<br>
 They do different tasks (run different applications) but the 
load on them is about the same. The IMac screen is better. The iMac 
&ldquo;seems&rdquo; to do a lot of background manipulation quicker. This makes 
the MAC a winner for me, but not a big winner. What gives it a big win is that 
whenever I have to close a machine down (say after a software upgrade or 
purge), The Mac is back up in way less than a minute. The PC takes about 15 
minutes. Yes, I have purged and optimised the PC, but it is still slow to 
reboot. The hard discs are both only about 10% full.<br>
 So, the MAC is the 
winner.<br>
 My chief complaint &ndash; there is no acceptable personal 
accounting software for a MAC (equivalent to MS Money or BankTree). But that 
will change soon, I hope.</p>

<p>I have been migrating my home setup from several Windows PCs/laptops to 
Apple devices for the last year or so. Ease-of-use is the biggest benefit of 
Apple products; h/w and s/w.<br>
 There is an adjustment to overcome in terms 
of usability &ndash; the look &amp; feel are different with switching over from 
10+ years of using Windows operating systems to the Mac OS taking a few days to 
adjust initially and then occasionally having to refer to Help on specific 
points.<br>
 As a family we now have iMac, Macbook, iPad, iphone x 4, AppleTV. 
They all work together seemlessly; particularly with wireless and iCloud 
features in latest versions Apple operating systems. My daughter&rsquo;s Dell 
laptop running Windows Vista is next to be replaced. The last device will be my 
&lsquo;office&rsquo; Dell PC running Windows XP Professional. A few 
Windows-only applications to migrate and then we will be Windows-free.</p> 
<p>I could echo a lot of the other points people have made already. The 
biggest time-saver for me using Mac instead of Windows has been photo and video 
editing. Mac blows Windows out of the water and has saved me literally days of 
time and effort producing high-quality slideshows and movies. The latest 
versions of iPhoto and iMovie are incredible.<br>
 Try it &ndash; you 
won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p>I nearly bought a Dell Laptop, but ended up with a Mac. It was &pound;800 
cheaper to get a Mac than a Dell. Why? Well, I had to upgrade the processor to 
that of the Macs, upgrade the Ram, Upgrade the OS to Ultimate before I got Mac 
functionality/security, Upgrade to get real actual disks, extra for online 
backup, extra for the same resolution screen as the Mac, extra for a comparable 
battery, extra for bluetooth, extra to transfer my applications (Apple do it 
for free in store or via free app) and I still didn&rsquo;t get firewire 800, 
thunderbolt, or great bundled software. Or a PCI card slot, or a multitouch 
trackpad and so it went on. In fact I have just done this again today and Dell 
want nearly &pound;1,900&hellip; don&rsquo;t bother. Ill stick to my are

<p>We switched to Mac last November. By that time we had 2 iPhones, 1 iPad and 
an iPod which we loved. I had bought several PCs previously, and if you go to 
PC World and get their reasonably cheap PCs you&rsquo;ll spend a lot more 
money, but we&rsquo;d done that before and were fed up with the failure of 
relatively new machines and the lack of support from PC World even when it was 
paid for. We had heard Mac was so much better and although more expensive we 
knew we&rsquo;d get more for the money. We had sorted out which software would 
need to be replaced and we kept the old PC to run a couple of programmes that 
we didn&rsquo;t want to place straight away. We discussed with the staff in the 
Apple Store what we needed and that is where you have the first joys!</p> 
<p>The staff answered questions quickly with specifics, they told us how much 
the machine would cost the cost of the extra software the cost of the Applecare 
and offered One to One year contract with no smoke and mirrors. It was a case 
of this is the price, this is what you get&hellip;. It all proved to be 
faultless. The buying experience was brilliant, they answered questions, even 
those not asked, when we wanted small amendments to the standard these were 
changed without extra charge or any trouble, when they offered Applecare and 
One to One there was no hard sell, just would you like that? We took the One to 
One sessions, 1 year &pound;79 as many 1 hour sessions as you like. I have had 
about 5 sessions so far, lovely trainers, will talk you through just about 
anything and I have learned a huge amount. I figured if I was going to spend so 
much money I would be better off knowing some of the ins &amp; outs and that 
has been very useful. Good value. You can do sessions on Aperture their 
advanced photo editing programme. I realised that I would have to buy that. I 
said to the trainer, this Aperture, I suppose that you have to pay to download 
the programme, yes said the trainer, &pound;45 but don&rsquo;t download it 
straight away, do a One to One on it (effectively free) and then if you think 
it is useful buy it if you like. No hard sell, straight forward, no smoke and 
mirrors, brilliant, I love the attitude.</p> 
<p>I love the iMac, my husband and I fight over it and neither wants to wait 
for the PC to boot up. We are now converts totally.</p> 
<p>Just one more comment, just after Christmas, went into the Apple Store to 
buy a cover for my new iPhone, all the shops in the Metrocentre had big sales 
on and lots of people were in the shops, The Apple Store had no sale, prices 
just the same as usual but the shop was full, even more than the other shops, 
no need for a sale! Says it all really!</p>

<p>I am disappointed with these kinds of articles from Which? I have several 
PCs, none of which run Windows. PC stands for &ldquo;Personal Computer&rdquo;. 
On them I run Arch Linux.</p> 
<p>I realise you say &ldquo;PC&rdquo; as so many people think this means 
&ldquo;Windows&rdquo; but promoting ignorance is no excuse. Especially for an 
organisation which is putting itself forward as technologically proficient.</p> 
<p>On the whole I trust your reviews. You let yourself down however with 
things like this and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t rely on anything Which? related 
where computing is concerned &ndash; hardware or software. I will always seek 
advice and reviews elsewhere.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not even advocating you include Linux &ndash; even though for the 
95% or so of people using computers for email, browsing and the odd office 
document etc., it would be ideal (free in cost and virus free)&hellip;. in 
fact, yes, maybe you should review it (maybe Ubuntu, as mentioned by Jon). 
You&rsquo;re certainly not giving a broad and informed view otherwise. You 
might even educate at the same time.</p> 
<p>Oh, and as for loving a (Windows) PC because &ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s 
fully customisable&rdquo; &ndash; I presume you mean hardware wise because the 
OS is certainly not customisable. That actually made me laugh, you get the same 
lock down with Windows and MacOS.</p> 
<p>I tried not to make this sound like a rant, I&rsquo;m certainly not a Linux 
fanatic, I just want to see some accuracy in articles like this. I&rsquo;m all 
for people using whatever suits them best and what they like. Some balance 
would be nice though for the overall picture.</p>

<p>Having moved to apple mac a few years ago I would never return to windows. 
An iPad is a good alternative to ultra books. I have retained a windows laptop 
to run my document scanner plus some software which was not mac compatable.</p> 
<p> I also have a new IPad and iPhone 3GS. Together they complete by E-family!

<p>The main complaint against Macs is the price (apart from the grumpy few who 
complain about them looking too good).</p> 
<p>But you can build your own for 60% of the cost! It does involve a bit of 
know-how and a bit if risk. Google &ldquo;hackintosh&rdquo; and follow your 
nose.</p> 
<p>You will need to buy all the components (from a carefully defined list of 
mac-compatible items) and assemble the machine yourself. Then download a pack 
of software (free, but make a donation). Buy (yes, sadly and correctly &mdash; 
this is not about piracy) a copy of OSX. Add a monitor of your choice. Follow 
the instructions.</p> 
<p>The result? A Mac equivalent. Not as nice-looking, but you will have the 
compensation of knowing that you put it together yourself.</p> 
<p>Mine is the size of a shoe box, has the power of an iMac, and cost about 
&pound;450 to build.</p> 
<p>Downsides? You can&rsquo;t use the automatic updater to upgrade OSX &ndash; 
it scrambles the machine. Of course, you have no warranty beyond those of the 
components.</p> 
<p>Upsides (apart from cost)? You can add memory and disk storage to suit 
yourself. Recommended upgrade is a solid state disk drive which accelerates 
many disk-bound operations, such as loading programs, by 50%. MS Word, for 
instance, loads in about 1.5 seconds. Try that on a Windoze PC!</p>
