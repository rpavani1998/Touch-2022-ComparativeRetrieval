Operating System <br>

<p>As different as the two operating systems also have many similarities as 
well. Learn more about these differences in terms of actual usability. Both 
operating systems are good, but you may prefer the simplicity of OS X over 
Windows.</p> 
<p>Chances are good that you have used Windows or Windows 7 before. However, 
not as many people have actually used aMac computer, which makes deciding 
whether or not to switch to Mac a confusing task. Both operating systems rely 
on basic principles to allow you to do the things you do on your computer. 
Everything from running programs to browsing the internet is in some way 
intertwined with the UI (User Interface) of each operating system. Check out 
some of these Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X basic principles.</p> 
<h2>Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X - Windows 7 Taskbar vs. Mac OS X Dock</h2> 
<p><strong></strong></p> <strong>  click to enlarge <br>
</strong> <strong>
Windows 7</strong>  uses the taskbar as an easy way to launch programs, access 
the Start Menu, monitor programs (in the tray), or even check the time. 
Notably, the Windows 7 taskbar is much improved over previous versions of 
Windows such as XP or Vista. The newest feature integrated with the Windows 7 
taskbar is called Taskbar Previews. Taskbar Previews is basically an easy way 
to monitor open programs and applications without actually opening up the 
program into full window view. To use the Taskbar Preview feature, you must 
have a Windows 7 Aero theme enabled. From there, you can simply hover your 
mouse over an active icon to get a preview.
<p></p> <br>

<p>The Windows 7 taskbar is something that you will use very frequently, 
probably every time you use your computer. Items can be added to the taskbar 
via right-click, and selecting the 'Pin to Taskbar' option from the context 
menu. Alternatively, programs can be rearranged and reordered in the Windows 7 
taskbar by dragging and dropping.</p> 
<p>Another notable feature of the Windows 7 taskbar is the tray icon area, 
which is often used by applications to display alerts and other important 
information. For example, Windows 7 uses a tray icon to alert you whenever 
there are automatic updates available.</p> 
<p>The very right side of the Windows 7 taskbar displays the clock. Just to 
the right of the clock is a thin, rectangular blank spot that can be used to 
clear the desktop.</p> 
<p>The Windows 7 taskbar can be relocated to the left, right, or top of the 
desktop.</p> 
<p>The Windows 7 taskbar is one of the most commonly used everyday operating 
system features within Windows 7.</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> <strong>  click to enlarge <br>
</strong> <strong>The 
Mac OS X</strong> dock is very much the Mac equivalent to the Windows 7 
taskbar. Like the Windows 7 taskbar, the Mac OS X dock is used to launch 
commonly used programs quickly and easily. One of the most current versions of 
Mac OS,Mac OS X Snow Leopard, uses a more featured, visually appealing dock 
than previous Mac OS versions. Notably, the Mac OS X dock has some unique 
features as well.
<p></p> <br>

<p>The Mac OS X dock is one of the most widely used features within Mac OS, 
and it is a rather convenient tool for launching applications, opening folders, 
and more. Mac OS X dock includes a magnificaiton feature that many Mac users 
enjoy. When turned on, dock magnification allows the dock to expand in the area 
that the mouse is placed. For example, if your hover your mouse over a certain 
application in the dock, the dock will 'bubble up' so that you can get a 
clearer view of that particular application. When you hover over a certain 
application in the dock, the name of that application is also displayed.</p> 
<p>Although the Mac OS dock does not have an equivalent to the Windows 7 
taskbar preview, it does have some other cool features of it's own. Notably, 
the Mac OS dock can hold folders. Each folder that you drop into the Mac OS 
dock has the ability to be displayed as a Folder or Stack. Although different 
in appearance, both Folder view and Stack view have the same concept. They 
allow you to open up a quick view of a folder, and jump directly to a document 
or program inside of the folder without opening up a new window. Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard has an applications folder in the dock, allowing you to jump to any 
application on your Mac quickly and easily without having to navigate through 
different locations.</p> 
<p>That's it for part 1. So far, we've only covered the slight differences in 
Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X basic interface. Be sure to continue on to page 2, where 
we will list even more everyday features that differ between the two operating 
systems. If you are trying to decide on whether toget a Mac vs. PC, there are 
several other things to note.</p>  Showing page 1 of 5 12345 next &raquo; <br>
