<p>&nbsp;</p> Perfect PC for CAD...How about Mac? Part 2 
<dl> 
<dt> 26 July 99. </dt> </dl> 
<p>The Architosh article entitled &quot;The Perfect PC for CAD...How about Mac?
&quot; provoked quite a bit reader feedback. In fact, the number of hits we 
received on the piece exceeded our previous best with our article on theAutoCAD 
2000 coming to Mac OS X rumor. The article encapsulates reader feedback and 
criticism and includes new information and responses to reader feedback.</p> 
<p><b>It's the Software Dumbo!</b></p> 
<p>Many readers simply said that sure the Macintosh has great hardware specs 
and is easy to use and maintain but there simply isn't enough software for it 
(in the CAD space that is). As some readers put it:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<blockquote> &quot; hi... sure, the Mac has great specs, but there's so few 
Mac SW packages for CAD! i do electronics design, and the PC choices far 
outclass the two Mac packages that exist (one of which, i use). this is 
obviously a big matter in any choice of machine. i am a big Mac supporter, but 
come on, you have to at least address this in your article.&quot; -reader 
</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;The problem is that many of the really good CAD programs do not run 
on the Mac [anymore which is a real] pity.&quot; -reader</p> 
<p>&quot;Just read your article &quot;What is the Perfect PC for CAD .. How 
about Mac?&quot;You don't have to convince me. I am a ten-year Mac loyalist! 
You need to convince the industry leaders for high-end CAD.</p> 
<p>For example, the authors of Pro-Engineer, SolidWorks, Microstation/J, and 
especially the ParaSolid kernel. Let's consider Pro-Engineer. It is currently 
something of a standard in aerospace. My company uses it, as do our most 
important customers [Lockheed Martin, U.S. Army]. Pro-Engineer runs on SGI 
Irix, Sun Solaris, and Windows NT. But not Macintosh. Ditto for ParaSolid, 
which many believe to be the emerging international standard for 3D CAD. It 
doesn't support Macintosh either&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;For example, my company has tasked me with the objective of placing a 
highly integrated SW system on up to 5,000 desktops within the next 5 years. 
The entire SW system has to be built around a single CAD product or system. 
This excludes Macintosh from the equation, because neither Pro-Engineer, nor 
the Parasolid kernel, nor Microstation/J, nor SolidWorks is compatible.&quot; - 
reader</p> 
<p>&quot; One point you left out in your short discussion: The software. As 
far as I know, AutoCAD, the PC Cad standard, still sells for around 3 grand per 
seat... VectorWorks and DenebaCAD, both of which work better on Macs, start 
around 700 bucks...and the price differential grows as you add more 
seats...&quot; - reader</p> 
<p>&quot;The real-world disadvantage to the Mac is not hardware based, nor is 
it OS based. Clearly the Mac is the best choice for most users on both fronts. 
The Mac OS provides a far superior user experience, and Mac hardware definitely 
kicks butt.</p> 
<p> The unfortunate real-world disadvantage to the Mac platform is that over 
the past several years a number of high end software developers have been 
abandoning their efforts for the Mac, most probably as a result of it being too 
thin a market to make their efforts pay off.</p> 
<p>My business depends on the following applications, all of which have ceased 
being developed for the Mac (for the foreseeable future at any rate). - AutoCAD 
stopped at R-12 (now up to R-2000 for PC) - Microstation stopped at SE (now up 
to MS-J for PC) - Microstation Modeler stopped at 95 (up to MS Modeler PE for 
PC)&quot; -reader</p> </blockquote>

<p>Without sounding too defensive, software was left out of the equation (and 
the price) in theprevious article not because there are so few choices in the 
Macintosh market -- because that isnot true -- but because the article was 
really about the machine itself, the hardware. No doubt, what good is a 
machine, no matter how bitchen fast and cool if the machine can't run those 
awesome CAD and 3D applications you wish to work in? Our feelings exactly!</p> 
<p>Part of the reason for the creation of the Architosh website is to 
evangelize and inform Macintosh users everywhere that the Macintosh is a viable 
platform for CAD professionals, especially architects, engineers and 
construction professionals. That's why we have asoftware list. But yes, it is 
true that there are some serious deficits in the software spectrum for both 
architecture and engineering. Let's try to solve that problem together by 
continuing to believe in the platform by purchasing more Macs and Macintosh 
software. With more and more sales growth, unit growth and software developer 
faith and encouragement in Apple, we can have our cake and eat it too -- 
someday. But it will take some time. The number one thing to do is to NOT write 
Apple about it (cc them, of course toleadership@apple.com) but instead write 
directly to the software company and tell them you want a Macintosh version of 
their software!</p> 
<p><b>The Perfect Mac &quot;Dream Machine&quot; for CAD</b></p> 
<p>The other item which came up in reader's minds was the technical 
description of the &quot;dream machine&quot; for the Mac compared to the PC 
Magazine version.</p> 
<p>To see this description see the previous article. What we did was build a 
system from the choices in the Apple Store and then say, &quot;what can we do 
to make it better?&quot;</p> 
<p>The target price to compare with the PC Magazine system was $9000.00 US. We 
know this is a lot, this is a &quot;dream machine&quot; exercise only and many 
of the descriptions and choices we made could be scaled back to create the 
ultimate machine of your liking.</p> &nbsp;

<p>Some the of the comments we received concerned the graphics systems on both 
the PC and Macintosh system, compared:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<blockquote> &quot;How do two graphics cards help to do anything other than 
run two monitors? Do they somehow piggyback or connect in series to run one 
monitor with the two cards giving you twice the video power for the one 
monitor? I don't get it. Otherwise, that's exactly the system I'm putting 
together for my new CAD system.&quot; -reader </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Our mistake. Adding an additional graphics card and adding more graphic RAM 
do different things. We said adding an additional card, which doesn't really do 
anything for processing power at all, unless the two cards worked in 
conjunction somehow. A Formac engineer told us that this is not likely, though 
it is theoretically possible. In general adding an additional graphics card 
only allows you a second monitor capacity -- though it is possible to get this 
capacity with one graphics card in the PC space.</p> 
<p>Another reader added this to the comments:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;Hello, </p> 
<p>You recently posted an article about PC Magazine's &quot;Dream CAD 
Machine&quot; and attempted to build an equivalent Mac. Unfortunately, your 
response fell short in one simple but incredibly important respect. The 
&quot;equivalent&quot; Mac OpenGL card you listed was a Rage128-based 32mb PCI 
card, which you admitted had less memory than the one on the &quot;Dream 
Machine.&quot; You suggested adding another card to double the RAM. 
Unfortunately, graphics RAM is not cumulative. Two slow graphics cards are 
still slow. The PC card you are comparing the Mac to is most likely one of the 
Oxygen cards from 3DLabs, based on a Glint-family chipset. The high-end Glint 
card has 96MB of RAM and uses it all, rendering complex, high-res 3D images far 
faster than any mainstream CPU can. These cards can easily top $2000. The 
Rage128 isn't even in the same league. Adding a similar card to a Yosemite (if 
there are any available for Macs . . .) could easily take it over the $9,000 
level. The article is an interesting exercise, but I think the conclusions are 
wrong in this case. Add to that the lack of MP systems and weak support from 
the likes of AutoDesk, Maya, and Avid, and Macs look weak indeed. As much as I 
hate NT, Apple cannot compete with it in the high-end without better products 
in hardware (MP G4s w/ slots) and software (OS X Consumer &amp; third-party 
support). We're going in the right direction, but Mac users will discredit the 
platform if we pretend to be what we aren't right now.&quot; -reader</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>This reader is absolutely right. We asked a Formac engineer at Expo if you 
could add additional RAM to a card by adding a card and he said not their 
cards. Such a card would have to be a daughter card on the main graphics card 
to add additional graphics RAM. We are not sure if such card arrangements even 
exist. This reader is also correct about the fact that an ATI RAGE 128 bit 
graphics card is not even in the same league as aOxygen card from 3DLabs (see 
our Expo report on Formac's Permedia 3-based card) But he is assuming that this 
PC Magazine is using such a card. We think this is probably the case too.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, what we learned is that the 32 MB ATI RAGE Nexus card is 
not the fastest card you can add to your Macintosh.Formac, a German company who 
has been a longtime supporter of Apple and the Macintosh has come out with 
their latest128-bit ProFormance 3 graphics card and the claim is that it is up 
to twice as fast as the ATI RAGE cards (to see comparisons click here). The 
card is based on a 3DLabs Permedia 3 graphics chipset (which is not as powerful 
as the Glint chipset used in the 3DLabs' Oxygen cards). However, a Formac 
engineer told us that the Permedia chipset uses a Glint core in its silicon and 
has similar performance functionality at some levels. He didn't say that the 
Formac ProFormance chip is as a fast as a Oxygen card with 96 MB of memory 
because that isn't probably possible.</p> 
<p>After discovering that Formac is basing their Mac graphics cards on 3DLabs' 
technologies one might wonder if they ever plan on bringing a super-fast, 
high-memory graphics card to the Macintosh similar to the industrial strength 
Oxygen cards. They said that the market for such cards is probably too small 
but things could change. Yes. Things can change and if you are interested in 
such cards with up to 96 MB of graphics RAM then write to Formac and ATI and 
ask them about it.</p> 
<p><b>Closing Comments</b></p> 
<p>Much of what we said in the first article still stands, with corrections 
being in order. One other correction is that the DVD video card is a daughter 
card that plugs into the ATI 128 RAGE card, leaving a PCI slot free. Perhaps we 
can have the Gigabit Ethernet after all?</p> 
<p>Where do we stand on the &quot;ultimate CAD dream machine&quot; for Mac 
users? In terms of hardware we need multiprocessing G4's, AltiVec-enabled CAD 
and 3D applications and a company like Formac to create an industrial-strength 
60 MB plus graphics card based on the Glint graphics chipset or something 
better. We also DO need some critical applications that are currently missing 
in the Macintosh space. With Mac OS X being similar to UNIX, some of these 
applications may be easier to port over to Mac OS X. If this is your situation, 
start letting those developers know that you want a Mac OS X version now. Don't 
wait until OS X comes out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more information about the ProFormance 3 card from Formac read our Expo 
Report: Part - 2. This discussion also talks about the usefulness of more 
graphics RAM, as we were told by Formac engineers.</p>
