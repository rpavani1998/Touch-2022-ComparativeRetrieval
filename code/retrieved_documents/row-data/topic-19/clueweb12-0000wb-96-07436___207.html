<h2> Carriers / Operators </h2> 
<h2>February 07, 2012</h2> 
<h3>Mobile operators exist in ambiguity</h3> 
<p>Last night I got off a call which I say was interesting with a major telco 
that is interested in working with me and the principles ofNo Straight Lines.
</p> 
<p>The company like many was once super successful - so successful in fact 
that it seemed nothing could stop it. And It was run as all telco's are - hard.
</p> 
<p>Hard as in &ndash; numbers driven, with a high tempo for delivering the 
quarterly numbers. 100% efficiency required 24 / 7 / 365.25.</p> 
<p>Hard as in people are only recognised as consumers, and the key objective 
is to maximise ARPU, by whatever means possible. And dont get me onto data 
roaming charges &ndash; hard.</p> 
<p>I reflected on a conversation I had 48 hours earlier with another global 
company (different industry sector) - their view was that by looking 40 years 
into the future if they carried on doing what they had been doing they would 
not exist as a company.</p> 
<p>Hence the phone call I was now getting from the telco.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Successful hubris #WTF?</strong></p> 
<p>Going back to the telco's big success over the last 20 years. Ego's get 
really big (I know - &quot;Alan if you are not going to give me a really big 
number we are not having this conversation&quot;) and then the more dangerous 
and subtle form of hubris manifests itself silently, slowly from the top and it 
trickles down into every nook and cranny in the company - but the problem with 
that is this is where mobile operators exist - in hubristic ambiguity.</p> 
<p>Until they get disrupted - brutally, cruelly, their cultural hubris means 
they can't deal with the ambiguity. And that is concussive as an experience.</p>
<p>Giving up power ain't easy, accepting and having the wisdom to see the 
world has changed - tough call.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Existing in a more complex world</strong></p> 
<p>For me its ironic that mobile has contributed so much to this supercharged 
socially networked world. Tomi and I wrote about Generation C (the community 
generation) 10 years ago.</p> 
<p>Yet these companies were formed and built like the steel mills, on Fordist 
principles. They were organisationally designed for a linear, and simple 
universe.</p> 
<p>But we are in transition from a linear world to a non-linear world, the old 
rules no longer apply, we see a world incresingly more complex and this 
presents real challenges.</p> 
<p>Watch every Telco try and make sense of a word built on sharing, 
networking, participatory cultures, &quot;we the media&quot;, and its like 
watching someone dance with two left feet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>How do organisations deal with complexity</strong></p> 
<p>[1] How do organisations of all creeds deal with a more complex and 
increasingly ambiguous world?</p> 
<p>[2] How do those organisations push through from living in an ambiguous 
world to one in which they can begin to design for adaptation?</p> 
<p>[3] How do organisations learn to design for a more open world &ndash; 
which will be necessary for survival?</p> 
<p>[4] How do organisations learn to design for a more participatory world?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Designing for transformation</strong></p> 
<p>In No Straight Lines - it is necessary to explore new organisational 
possibilites that also relate to the relevancy of comercial organisations in 
todays world - their sustainability and their social impact. Mobile companies 
play such an important and extraordinary role in this future<strong>. </strong>
But not as they currently exist.</p> 
<p>And in No Straight Lines - we point to and demonstrate that there are 
excellent models for organisations today which would enable them to [1] 
transition [2] then transform into something that looks more appropriate and 
relevant for the world we live in today. For me the real frustration is 
watching companies career into oblivion, which also reminds me of the opening 
words from No Straight Lines<em><strong>. </strong></em>Taken from<strong>&nbsp;
</strong> a Robert Penn Warren novel:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 'You look up the highway and it is straight for miles. Coming at 
you, with the black line down the centre coming at you, black and slick and 
tarry-shining against the white of the slab, and the heat dazzles up from the 
white slab so that only the black line is clear, coming at you with the whine 
of tires, and if you don't quit staring at that line and don't take a few deep 
breaths and slap yourself hard on the back of the neck you'll hypnotise 
yourself and you'll come to just at the moment when the right wheel hooks over 
the black dirt shoulder off the slab, and you'll come to jerk her back on but 
you can't because the slab is high like a curb, and maybe you'll try to reach 
to turn off the ignition just as she starts to dive. But you won't make it of 
course.&rsquo;

<h3>Mo Mobile mAdness - Ecosystem-Elop Sells Nokia Mobile Ad Unit (??? - True!)
</h3> 
<p>This makes NO sense. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop himself has said that the war 
in mobile today is one of ecosystems, not of mere handsets or their software. 
Elop himself has explicitly mentioned advertising as one of the key components 
of a mobile ecosystem. If Elop practised what he preached, he would not be 
selling his mobile advertising unit, he would be nurturing it, growing it - not 
selling it.<br>
<br>
Google believes so strongly in mobile advertising, they 
bought Admob. Apple's Steve Jobs believed so strongly in mobile advertising, he 
launched iAd. The company that invented the cellular telecoms industry - and 
launched the world's first mobile internet service, NTT DoCoMo of Japan 
believes so strongly in mobile advertising, they created D2C the world's 
biggest pure mobile ad agency. Even Stephen Elop's past employer Microsoft 
believes so strongly in mobile advertising, they bought ScreenTonic, and today 
have mobile advertising a central aspect of the Windows Phone ecosystem. And 
what does Elop do at Nokia? He justsold Nokia's mobile advertising unit on 
Friday to a company previously known as Matchbin and now renamed Radiate Media.
<br> <br>
 CENTRAL TO ECOSYSTEM<br>
<br>
 I don't want to make this blog a 
monologue about Nokia. But if Elop does something this mad, at this time, then 
I do have to observe it. As it is Stephen Elop who has been lecturing the world 
about how the race in mobile phones is no longer one of hardware or software, 
it is about ecosystems. And Elop himself defined ecosystems as they relate to 
mobile handsets in general and Nokia explicitly, as:<em> &quot;Ecosystems 
include not only the hardware and software of the device, but developers, 
applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social applications, 
location-based services, unified communications and many other things.&quot;
</em><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p><em><strong>Advertising! </strong></em>One of the key components of a 
mobile ecosystem. And Elop has tried to rally his Nokia employees to engage in 
a battle of ecosystems. He warned that Nokia's competitors<em> &quot;are taking 
our market share with an entire ecosystem.&quot;</em> He claimed last year in 
his notorious Burning Platforms memo that Nokia had fallen behind on this 
ecosystems war. He said that Nokia had<em>&quot;lacked accountability and 
leadership&quot;</em> and that Nokia <em>&quot;had not delivered innovation 
fast enough&quot;</em>. <br>
<br>
 OBVIOUS MAJOR GLOBAL TREND<br>
<br>
 Apple 
decided to launch iOS in the summer of 2009, at a time when the total global 
shipments of all iOS based devices, iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch'es had not 
passed 50 million cumulatively (including devices no longer in use). Yet Apple 
felt mobile advertising was that important to the Apple iPhone and iOS 
ecosystem. Steve Jobs himself explained why the ecosystem would be stronger 
with an ad platform explaining that<em>&quot;developers have to find a way to 
make some money&quot;</em> and that the iAd platform was a way Apple could help 
its developers in its ecosystem.<br>
<br>
 Google decided to buy Admob in 
December of 2009. At that time, there were far less than 10 million Android 
smartphones in use worldwide. By 2011, Google's Chairman Eric Schmidt was 
saying that mobile advertising was delivering 2.5 Billion dollars of ad 
revenues to the company.<br>
<br>
 I mentioned that NTT DoCoMo created D2C 
together with the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu. Microsoft got into mobile 
advertising years ago with the purchase of ScreenTonic. Major mobile industry 
players from carriers/operators like Vodafone and Telefonica to equipment 
makers like Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent offer solutions in the mobile ad space.
<br><br>
Mobile advertising (roughly) doubled in annual revenues in the year 
2008 when the world economy crashed. Mobile advertising almost doubled again in 
2009 and 2010 yet again. Early numbers say mobile advertising had again roughly 
doubled in 2011. By 2011 the global advertising industry had embraced mobile 
ads from Ford saying that mobile ads will be integral to every ad campaign they 
run on any medium, to US food giant Kraft saying 'no mobile left behind'.<br>

<br> If you believe in growth opportunities coming from those sectors of the 
industry that expanding most strongly, mobile advertising is that right now. 
Certainly Google, Apple, Microsoft, NTT DoCoMo, Vodafone etc see this and 
invest heavily in it. Is there any doubt, that mobile advertising is a key 
component in any ecosystem in mobile? None whatsoever.<br>
<br>
 WHEN DID NOKIA 
GO mAD<br>
<br>
 I happen to know the mobile advertising side of the mobile 
content and media industry quite well, as I was the first person to discuss 
commercially launched mobile ads at any international conference (in Austria) 
literally within weeks after they had launched (in Finland in year 2000). And I 
was honored to chair the world's first mobile advertising conference in London 
the next year. That conference had many pioneers of mobile ad space, 
presenting, as were some big advertising companies who had launched their 
mobile advertising units. But there was only one handset manufacturer 
presenting at the two-day conference on mobile advertising. That handset 
manufacturer was ...Nokia.<br>
<br>
 Nokia was studying the mobile advertising 
opportunity more than a decade ago, so much, that they had an internal unit 
looking at it (modest in size at the time) and Nokia had commissioned a global 
study about mobile advertising in 2001, long before most thought that ads 
served to our pockets were even commercially plausible.<br>
<br>
 Nokia 
monitored the space, and as mobile advertising slowly achieved acceptance 
beyond some of the most advanced markets like Japan and South Korea (and 
Scandinavia) Nokia then got serious about mobile advertising when it bought 
Enpocket. When was that? In 2007 ! Two years before Apple and Google got 
serious about mobile advertising. And since then Nokia had developed the mobile 
advertising arm at its Navteq unit, and bought other mobile advertising 
companies such as Acuity Mobile in 2009.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So is it factually NOT true (once again the Elop delusions) in this 
empirical case about fighting in ecosystems rather than handsets, that Nokia 
supposedly<em> &quot;fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time. At 
that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit 
of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind.&quot;</em> <br>
<br>
In 
reality, as it relates to mobile advertising (just like in mobile payments, 
location and mapping, app stores, videogames, music etc) Nokia<em><strong>caught
</strong><strong> the big trend</strong></em>, were indeed <em><strong>making 
the right decisions</strong></em>, and with the benefit of<em><strong> 
incredibly accurate foresight</strong></em>, once again, <em><strong>found 
itself years ahead</strong></em>. The truth is 100% diametrically opposite of 
what Elop has been saying (once again). Nokia was not years behind, Nokia was 
literally years ahead of all its rivals in this space.</p> 
<p><br>
 BATTLE OF ECOSYSTEMS<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Elop preaches about the battle of ecosystems. The Nokia Symbian platform, 
one of several Nokia technical platforms, and the one most suited for mobile 
advertising today, is not just the world's biggest smartphone operating system 
by installed base - and<em><strong>advertisers will equate installed base with 
'audience'</strong></em> rather than new sales, where last year Elop's 
mis-management of Nokia smarpthones saw Symbian sales fall behind Google's 
Android and Apple's iPhone iOS. But lets just examine that potential 
advertising target audience a bit more. Here are the world's twenty largest 
countries by population, and the biggest smartphone OS as of November as 
measured by statcounter:<br>

<p><br>
 (above adapted from statcounter data from November 29, 2011, as 
reported by browserrank.com)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yes! Nokia's 'obsolete' Symbian is the biggest smartphone operating system 
in 17 out of the 20 largest countries on the planet by population. And its not 
just that Nokia has this incredible reach. Consider the other competing 
advertising mass media.<br>
<br>
 In the USA, the television market is the 
biggest advertising market and the biggest mass medium. In some of the more 
affluent markets on the above list, most households do have TV sets like in 
China and Russia. In all but one of the above countries, more people access 
internet content on mobile phones than on PCs (the exception being the USA 
where the half-point will be passed this year 2012). And in many of the less 
affluent countries on that list, even radio does not reach as widely as mobile 
phones. Like they say in Africa, mobile is not the 7th mass medium, its not the 
first mass medium; it is the only mass medium.</p> 
<p><br>
 Nokia owns the smartphone OS platform that reaches the widest 
audience in 17 out of the 20 biggest countries on the planet. Where iOS and 
Admob and others face strong competition in advertising from legacy mass media 
like TV, newspapers, radio etc; and obviously internet advertising - Nokia's 
Symbian platform is the<em><strong>dominant smartphone platform in all 
countries where legacy media is not established as a true 'mass' medium</strong>
</em> reaching even half of the population and where mobile access to the 
internet exceeds PC based access to the internet.<br>
<br>
 Nonetheless, 
Apple's iPhone has an installed based (not cumulative shipments, but active 
users) of about 150 million smartphone users today. Remember, for any iOS media 
partner - including any advertising, we need to add the other iOS users, iPads 
and iPod Touch'es, so the total reach of the iOS currently is about 240 
million. Google's Android reaches about 250 million active users today. 
Microsoft feels it worthwhile to continue building its mobile advertising unit 
even as its reach across both Windows Mobile and Windows Phone smartphones, 
currently, is less than 30 million. But Nokia's Symbian has currently over 275 
million users worldwide. And the CEO who thinks its a war about ecosystems, and 
believes that advertising is a key part of ecosystems, doesn't want to keep 
Nokia's competitive advantage here, one that Nokia years ahead of its rivals in 
discovering and exploiting?<br>
<br>
 NOKIA TRUE REACH FAR WIDER<br>
<br>
 The 
above picture is not the full picture for a Nokia ecosystem. Nokia sells more 
S40 based featurephones, which use the proprietary S40 operating system (not 
part of Symbian) but which could be described as 'smartphone lite' - just like 
Symbian, S40 does allow full internet use, allows application downloads and the 
use of the Nokia (ex Ovi) store for content, apps and services. Nokia does not 
give us a breakdown of the S40 sales, but Nokia recently celebrated the 1.5 
Billionth S40 cumulative shipment number. In rough terms the installed base of 
S40 currently is more than 700 million, so when added together, Symbian and S40 
give Nokia an addressable market potential of 1 Billion mobile phone users 
worldwide.<br>
<br>
(Note this does not include the ultra-cheap dumbphones that 
use the even simpler Nokia S30 OS, by which Nokia's total reach was last year 
estimated at about 1.7 Billion)<br>
<br>
This ecosystem of Symbian and S40, 
plus Nokia's other current and past OS platforms like MeeGo and Maemo; plus 
Nokia's upcoming low-cost smartphone OS, Meltemi, are all supposed to be 
supported by the Qt developer tools of Nokia. So if we count Nokia branded Qt 
ecosystem potential reach, it is well in excess of 1 Billion pockets. And add 
to that the Android installed base (Qt supports Android) and potentially 
Blackberry (the new Blackberry OS will be compatible with Qt) - the Nokia 
'first ecosystem' if built around Qt has a potential reach of more than 1.35 
Billion mobile phone users (more than 5x bigger than the total iOS ecosystem or 
the Android ecosystem; more than 12 times bigger than the total Blackberry 
ecosystem and more than 100 times bigger than the Windows Phone). Yet Elop is 
doing everything he can to sink that Nokia-controlled first ecosystem and 
replace it with what Microsoft tries to call the 'third ecosystem' ie Windows 
Phone, which only reaches the pockets of less than 12 million people in the 
world, and is legitimately called at best, the 8th ecosystem.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ELOP DEFINITION OF LEADERSHIP<br>
<br>
 We have seen it time and again. We 
saw it with the Ovi store, we saw it with Nokia developer relationships, we saw 
it with mobile commerce and NFC (the Lumia series does not support NFC while 
Nokia's own MeeGo and Symbian both of course do support NFC). And now once 
again we see it with mobile advertising. Elop discovers a significant Nokia 
advantage in its ecosystem. Even as it is an element of genuine leadership, 
that is supported by essentially the whole industry as an obvious trend,<em>
<strong>Elop goes against the trend. He damages the Nokia version</strong></em> 
(or in this case sells it).<strong><em>This destroys a Nokia native advantage 
'in a war of ecosystems'</em></strong> and instead brings Nokia ever more to 
the full control of Microsoft, as its slave.<br>
<br>
 Before this action, 
Nokia could control how advertising might appear on Nokia branded smartphones. 
Nokia could sell advertising to its own smartphones. Now Nokia branded 
smartphones, when using the Microsoft Windows Phone OS, will be subject to 
Microsoft advertising concepts and spyware. Microsoft will also be selling the 
ads irrespective of Nokia's own brand. Its quite feasible for Samsung or HTC to 
spam Nokia branded smartphones via the Windows Phone ad platform. Is this the 
sensible way to go?<br>
<br>
 ONLY BECAUSE OF ELOP<br>
<br>
This desperation 
move is purely due to mismanagement and mistakes by Elop. I am not claiming all 
was hunky dory at Nokia prior to Elop. I have written time and again, that 
Nokia was struggling in 2009 to 2010, and fired its CEO Kallasvuo, replacing 
him with Elop. I am not in any way suggesting that all was perfect at Nokia 
when Elop took over. But the first five months at Nokia, when Elop was in 
charge, saw the Nokia<em><strong>smartphone unit sales grow </strong></em>
strongly,<em><strong>Nokia smartphone sales revenues grow </strong></em>
dramatically, and<em><strong>Nokia profits at the smartphone unit jump</strong>
</em> at a Nokia record level. <em><strong>Nokia overall corporate profits grew
</strong></em>. In the first five months of Elop's stewardship, <em><strong>
Nokia's share price had grown by 11%</strong></em>. I am not saying all was 
well, but Nokia had passed the worst part, and was on the road to better. Nokia 
was 'on the mend'. And Elop was hired - as then Chairman of Nokia Jorma Ollila 
said when introducing Stephen Elop -<em><strong>Elop was hired to fix Nokia 
problems in execution</strong></em>.<br>
<br>
 From February 2011 to today, 
Nokia has set a world record in destroying its market share. In smartphones 
Nokia's market share fell from 29% in Q4 of 2010, to 12% of Q4 of 2011. Nokia 
very literally scared away six out of every ten customers it had a year ago. 
For the full year 2010, Nokia was twice as big as its nearest rival. By Q4 
Nokia had shrunk to nearly half the size of its strongest rival, Apple's iPhone.
<br> <br>
 This carnage has all been a self-induced wound, and it started with 
theElop Effect, but Elop has added to the problems continuously ever since. 
Elop himself admitted the damage to Nokia market share took him by surprise and 
admitted later to more surprise that Nokia plunged from generating profits to 
generating losses. It did not surprise any real experts of the mobile industry, 
many of us said days after Elop announced hismad Microsoft strategy last 
February, that this would be the result, like I did on this blog, correctly 
forecasting that Nokia's market share would crash to 12% by the end of the 
year, and Nokia's strongly growing profits in its smartphone unit would reverse 
into loss-making, and the damage to all of Nokia would be so severe, that all 
of Nokia would generate a loss by the end of the year.<br>
<br>
 Elop had a 
company that had growing sales, growing revenues, growing profits, and a 
growing share price - and turned that to losing sales, losing revenues, 
generating losses and a massively crashing share price (Nokia's share price 
fell to less than half in the next five months). This damage is not only the 
world record crash of market share of any mobile phone handset maker. Its not 
only the biggest fall ever witnessed in any one year by a global brand leader 
in technology such as computers or home electronics etc.It is literally the 
biggest fall of a global customer base, in any one year, of any company, in any 
industry - ever.<br>
<br>
 And Elop did not see it coming, and did not manage 
his company wisely. That is all water under the bridge. Yes it was thebiggest 
management failure in the economic history of humankind, that we witnessed last 
year. Because of it, Nokia now is in deep trouble and has to try to sell assets 
just to remain alive. Elop has been trying to sell the NokiaSiemens Networking 
unit and is currently trying to sell the Vertu luxury phones unit. He has sold 
various Nokia assets from several sets of Nokia's prime patents, to a whole 
handset factory in Romania. Andnow he sold Nokia's advertising arm.<br>
<br>
 I 
can understand that the CEO of a company that is massively generating losses 
(no matter what the cause) is now resorting to desperate moves such as firing 
tens of thousands of employees and selling assets.<br>
<br>
 RATHER THAN SELL 
AD UNIT, WHY NOT ALLOW SALES OF N9<br>
<br>
 What I cannot understand, is if 
Nokia is in the business of selling mobile phones, and its most profitable 
smartphones are currently onthe undersirable Lumia brand (where sales 
representatives at stores find that in 11 cases out of 12, a customer who buys 
a Nokia branded smarthpone refuses to take a Lumia) and thehighly desirable 
MeeGo platform (where sales representatives find that one in four customers who 
buys a Nokia smartphone, will buy an N9 which uses the MeeGo operating system) 
- why is Elop not willing to sell the N9 (and its sister phone the N950) in 
every market!<br>
<br>
 Elop would rather sell Nokia assets, such as Nokia's 
patent portfolio, its factories, its staff, and now, its mobile advertising 
unit - than allow the MeeGo based N9 (and its sister, the N950) to be sold 
worldwide!<br>
<br>
 Elop's priorities are wrong. He looks at global trends 
where the whole industry is in agreement - like now with mobile advertising. 
And he goes against it.<em><strong>He finds a genuine Nokia asset where Nokia 
was years ahead of the rivals - like now with mobile advertising - and rather 
than fix that unit's execution to deliver massive profits for Nokia, he prefers 
to sell it.</strong></em> Google just told us last year that Google makes 2.5 
Billion dollars of advertising revenues out of its mobile advertising arm. Why 
doesn't Elop fix this at Nokia, Nokia has a far wider reach in countries where 
mobile advertising is often the only mass market advertising medium.<br>
<br>
 
The decision to sell the mobile advertising unit at Nokia may have been 
necessary because Nokia is so badly generating a loss.<em><strong>That loss is 
solely due to Elop's mismanagement of Nokia last year</strong></em>. Before 
February, Nokia's profits were growing strongly. And Elop himself admitted he 
miscalculated how badly Nokia smartphone sales would collapse, and he also 
admitted surprise to the sudden massive losses that obviously resulted. The 
reason Nokia is now conducting a fire sale of its best assets is only due to 
incompetent management by its CEO, causing self-induced damage to Nokia, its 
products, its carrier relations, its customers and its brand.<br>
<br>

Nonetheless, to sell a mobile advertising unit for a major handset maker goes 
totally against the grain, where rivals are investing more in advertising, not 
less. And this is how Nokia's CEO actions speak the opposite of his words. This 
selling of a key Nokia ecosystem component is how Nokia's CEO communicates to 
his staff how his new management stops the competition from&nbsp;<strong><em>
&quot;taking our market share with an entire ecosystem.&quot;</em></strong>
&nbsp;This selling of the mobile advertising unit is how Nokia's new CEO 
indicates<em><strong>&quot;accountability and leadership&quot;</strong>.</em>
&nbsp;This sale of Nokia's pioneering mobile ad unit is how the CEO rewards 
those parts of Nokia that did indeed<strong><em>&quot;deliver innovation fast 
enough&quot;</em></strong>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The decision to sell the mobile 
advertising unit at Nokia was<em><strong>certainly not to the best interests of 
Nokia</strong></em> and Nokia's ecosystem. But the decision to sell away 
Nokia's own mobile advertising arm, and turn Nokia hostage to Microsoft's 
advertising, is<em><strong>in the best interests of Microsoft.</strong></em><br>
<br> Nokia CEO Stephen Elop is once again acting in the best interests of 
Microsoft, and against the best interests of Nokia.<em><strong>He is in breach 
of stock market regulations and clearly hasacted with a confict of interest. 
His actionsmust be investigated as a breach of his fiduciary duty to Nokia 
shareholders. He must be fired for cause and any Nokia Board Members who do not 
support an immediate investigation of Elop should be themselves investigated 
for collusion, neglect or incompetence.</strong></em></p>

<h2>January 20, 2012</h2> 
<h3>What does Kodak have to teach us?</h3> 
<p>I am sure we are all a little sad of the passing of Kodak.</p> 
<p>Some of us of a certain age have piles of Kodak slides and snaps, even old 
Kodak cameras around the place. Hearing about Kodaks resignation and demise 
also got me thinking about Nokia, and indeed other organisations and industries 
that struggle and fail as they were unable to adjust to what was them an 
ambiguous world.</p> 
<p><strong>The coming age of an uncertain world<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>When faced with an ambiguous world some move into 
that world, and embrace it to understand it, listen deeply and think very hard 
about transformation - how to transform, how to design for transformation. This 
is a very hard thing to do and few do it well -LEGO being an example of the few
. And why is that? As Carlota Perez argues in her bookTechnological Revolution 
and Financial Capital,</p> 
<p><em>When the economy is shaken by a powerful set of new opportunities with 
the emergence of the next technological revolution, society is still strongly 
wedded to the old paradigm and its institutional framework</em>. <em>Suddenly 
in relation to the new technologies, the old habits and regulations become 
obstacles, the old services and infrastructures are found wanting, the old 
organisations and institutions inadequate. A new context must be created; a new 
&lsquo;common sense&rsquo; must emerge and propogate.</em></p> 
<p>There is indeed deep institutional resistance to real change. This is due 
to the voices of fear, cynicism and prejudice. And, as the forces of disruption 
increases often the resistance of organisations under threat does not abate but 
intensifies, until flailing against this unknown or misunderstood enemy they 
exhaust themselves.</p> 
<p>Its why Ambiguity is the first principle of NSL. You can read briefly about 
the other six here -6 challenges for a non-linear world. With ambiguity there 
are 5 key points,</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Accept the uncertainties of an ambiguous world and become master of them.
</li> 
<li>Stepping back &ndash; seeing the world more holistically &ndash; as a 
system</li> 
<li>It requires deep listening</li> 
<li>To move from being unaware to aware</li> 
<li>To seek new patterns that make sense even if they challenge pre-conceived 
ideas, positions and ways of doing things.</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>To be a little more expansive in NO Straight Lines I write:</strong>
</p> 
<p><em>In many ways ambiguity is the output of our current trilemma, but for 
that very reason it must also be a defining principle. When we individually and 
collectively live in an age of uncertainty, we must all become masters of 
managing uncertainty. As individuals or organisations we need to demonstrate 
the ability to face the future openly; we have to replace fear of the unknown 
with curiosity. We need to become aware of what is around us. To do that 
requires a step change in learning and self-improvement &ndash; this is 
achieved through continuous contemplation and self-reflection which ultimately 
enables the mastery of an aware self/organisation, with the motivation to 
pursue truly motivated goals.</em></p> 
<p><em>There is a need to accept a lack of control, and of uncertainty, not 
only being prepared to accept being taken outside of one&rsquo;s comfort zone 
but deliberately seeking it out &ndash; the consequence of which is a more 
disciplined mind or organisational culture, that is now capable of strong 
creative and conceptual thinking.</em></p> 
<p><strong>So if we look at LEGO</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li>They had the wisdom to recognise the old model of commerce was broken</li> 
<li>They had the courage to explore new and emergent means by which to create 
a new sustainable business</li> 
<li>They listened deeply and evolved an internal ability to critically 
appraise where they needed to get to</li> 
<li>They recognised the important patterns in co-creation and how they could 
have real benefits for R&amp;D, organisational capability, commercial models 
and marketing</li> 
<li>This enabled them to evolve to a new more sustainable economic / social / 
organizational model</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>The dangers of trying to innovate whilst looking in the rear view 
mirror</strong></p> 
<p>Om Malik writes,</p> 
<p>As my friend Pip Coburn says,<strong>&nbsp;turnarounds never turn</strong>. 
Kodak has been in restructuring mode for 15 years &ndash; cutting headcount, 
closing factories, tightening belts and squeezing rocks for blood. In other 
words &mdash; the company isn&rsquo;t fat in a traditional sense.&nbsp; But why 
none of its strategies worked was&nbsp; because the company took too long and 
sat on its duff watching digital photography come and eat it for a mid-day 
snack even though Kodak R&amp;D helped with the digital photo revolution when 
it launched the first digital camera in 1975.</p> 
<p>And yet they failed to do what one of their major competitors &ndash; 
FujiFilm did &mdash; embrace digital with both arms&nbsp;and is now thriving. 
And when Kodak finally did embrace digital in 1993<strong> it did with 
hesitance that comes when companies are afraid to cannibalize their existing 
businesses for the sake of the future.<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Disruption never asks for permission</strong></p> 
<p>Nokia said it would never release a touch screen phone, so someone else did 
- a software company. In my journey in writing NO Straight Lines, I have seen 
this organisational myopia as a constant red thread. So I argue, to survive 
organisations have to disrupt themselves before someone else does it to them. 
Or as Arthur C. Clarke said,</p> 
<p><em>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a 
little way past them into the impossible</em></p> 
<p>Malik writes,</p> 
<p><em>Anyone remember the Nokia 770? That phone could have been Nokia&rsquo;s 
future, instead it is forgotten. &nbsp;Nokia&nbsp;defined itself by a certain 
kind of a product &ndash; the 12-key phone. People at Nokia talked about a 
multimedia mobile computer, but it couldn&rsquo;t look beyond those 12 keys. It 
took Apple and Google to show Nokia how to re-imagine the phone.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Standing at the edge of the adaptive range of our industrial world
</strong></p> 
<p>We have arrived at the edge of the adaptive range of our industrial world. 
At the edge, because that world, our world is being overwhelmed by a trilemma 
of social, organisational and economic complexity. We are in transit from a 
linear world to a non-linear one. Non-linear because it is for all of us 
socially, organisationally and economically ambiguous, confusing and worrying. 
Consequently we are faced with an increasingly pressing and urgent problem, 
WHAT COMES NEXT? And also we are therefore presented with a design challenge: 
HOW do we create better societies, more able organisations and, more vibrant 
and equitable economies relevant to the world we live in today? No Straight 
Lines presents a new logic and inspiring plea for a more human centric world 
that argues we now have the possibility to truly transform our world, to be 
more resilient, to be more relevant to us both personally and collectively, 
socially cohesive, sustainable, economically vibrant and humane, through the 
tools, capabilities, language and processes at our fingertips.</p> 
<p>The key to unlocking this opportunity, so we can design for transformation 
is through understanding the interlocking concepts of the six key principles of 
No Straight Lines, these are:</p> 
<p>[1] Ambiguity [2] Adaptiveness [3] Participatory cultures and tools [4] 
Openness</p> 
<p>[5] Craftsmanship [6] Epic &ndash; designing for transformation</p> 
<p>It means we can then ask this question: <strong>How do we find the best 
possible solution to seemingly intractable problems, and be able to answer them?

<h3>6 challenges for organisations to thrive in a non-linear world</h3> 
<p>There are 6 challenges I believe that organisations have to navigate to 
thrive in a non-linear world.</p> 
<p>These are:</p> 
<p><strong>[1]</strong> How do organisations of all creeds deal with a more 
complex and increasingly ambiguous world?</p> 
<p>[2] How do those organisations push through from living in an ambiguous 
world to one in which they can begin to design for adaptation?</p> 
<p><strong>[3]</strong> How do organisations learn to design for a more open 
world - which will be necessary for survival?</p> 
<p><strong>[4]</strong> How do organisations learn to design for a more 
participatory world?</p> 
<p><strong>[5]</strong> How do organisations develop a methodology for 
craftsmanship at a personal and more organisational level?</p> 
<p><strong>[6]</strong> How do organisations prepare for and design for 
transformation?</p> 
<p>These six challenges are also the six principles of NSL. What our research 
shows us that whether executed digitally or in our analogue world or indeed 
blended together - those organisations that have addressed these issues with 
conviction are the ones that have moved being stuck in a world of concussive 
ambiguity.</p>

<h3>The real Top 13 reasons why Nokia Lumia and Windows Phone will fail, not 
just in USA but across planet</h3> 
<p>Nokia was prominently featured at the CES show in the USA this week, the 
biggest consumer electonics show of North America. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop was 
on stage a couple of times as was Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. The brand new 
Nokia Lumia 900 won best product of the show. And nicely on que, Forbes ran an 
article of theFive Reasons Why Windows Phone Will Make Big Splash in Smartphone 
Market. The article got a lot of attention and on first read, to the random 
reader, it seems to make good arguments (I will deal with those later). The 
first point to make, is that the author, E.D. Kain, had actually written a pair 
of articles about Windows Phone, this one yes in favor butalso another one 
against.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There have been many commentaries of the issue, perhaps 
the best direct response was by Don Reisinger at eWeek. He gave10 reasons why 
Windows Phone will fail. His arguments are very good, but they are somewhat USA 
focused and still do not tackle some of the biggest reasons why Windows Phone - 
and Nokia Lumia - will fail. Lets take this issue logically, reasonably and 
with facts, not just conjecture and opinion and hope and hype. And lets start 
where most sensible marketers start, not from the product but from the 
consumer. What is it that we, smartphone buyers, want. And readers, this is 
again one of those ultra-long Tomi Ahonen essays, about 16,000 words (more than 
a full chapter in a hardcover book) so go get yourself a good cup of coffee 
before you start. It will probably take you half an hour to complete this 
article but I promise you, it is stuffed with facts, stats, insights and 
goodies.<br>
<br>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<br>
<br>
I know this is a painfully long 
article for most to read. So let me give you the quick executive summary 
version here on the top. Please do read the specific part in the full article, 
before commenting. But the short version is this. We know from global consumer 
surveys what people do on their phones, and what consumers look for when buying 
smartphones. That has even been measured across the differences of the wealthy 
countries of the Industrialized World, and the less-affluent smartphone buyers 
in the Emerging World. I have used real consumer data mostly from 2011, to 
examine every major element that is decisive in smartphone purchases today. I 
took the 13 most relevant areas which cover consumer phones and 
business/enterprise phones; across the rich world and the Emerging World. And 
on every one of those 13 areas, I evaluated Lumia compared to where Nokia (and 
Microsoft) was before and where its rivals are now. This is what I found:<br>

<br>Reason 1 - Messaging Madness: Nokia has a natural strength in 
messaging-oriented smartphones (the most used feature of all mobile phone 
owners from Africa to the USA is messaging, including smartphone owners). It is 
abandoned with the first 3 Lumia phones. Nokia voluntarily foregoes a 
competitive advantage that it has always before taken advantage of. Thus Lumia 
will perform worse than Nokia smartphones have done before.<br>
<br>
Reason 2 - 
Camera Catastrophy - Nokia mobile phones have always been known for good 
cameras, its flagship phones tend to have had the best cameras in the world. 
The camera is the second most used feature. The Lumia series is a downgrade of 
Nokia camera capability and will severely disappoint past Nokia owners and not 
stand up to rivals today.<br>
<br>
Reason 3 - Look and Feel is not competitive. 
Nokia Lumia has gotten good reviews for its appearance but nothing beyond that. 
And by its one form factor alone, it will not win many converts, but on the 
abandoned other form factors, and its lack of typical Nokia elements, it is a 
downgrade from what Nokia has been in the past, and yet is not competitive with 
rivals today.<br>
<br>
Reason 4 - Nokia Brand failure. Nokia's brand has been 
damaged very badly in the past year. Whatever Nokia was able to do in 2010, 
today Nokia will do far worse, whether in the USA or rest of the world.<br>
<br>
Reason 5 - Windows Brand failure. The Nokia brand damage is recent and perhaps 
reversable but Microsoft's brand damage with Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 
has been sustained far longer and been far more comprehensive. Microsoft has 
good brands such as Xbox and Office Suite but its Windows Brand is weak and in 
mobile, it is poisonous.<br>
<br>
Reason 6 - Input failure. &nbsp;The Nokia 
strength has been exceptional QWERTY keyboards. On the N9 using MeeGo Nokia was 
able to innovate with touch screen inputs. But Lumia has neither. It is a cheap 
copycat of the iPhone style touch screen input and Lumia abandons natural Nokia 
strengths while showing no competitive advantages.<br>
<br>
Reason 7 - Fails in 
variety of models. Nokia has traditionally been able to hold to the world's 
largest smartphone market share - a year ago Nokia was literally not just 
bigger than the iPhone, it was bigger than the iPhone and all Samsung 
smartphones - combined. Now Samsung is 'doing the Nokia' with its expanding 
Galaxy portfolio while the three Lumia devices are near clones of each other. 
Nokia is again voluntarily abandoning a competitive advantage, which means 
Lumia will perform less well than Nokia was able to do in the past.<br>
<br>

Reason 8 - fails on apps and app store. Nokia's Ovi was the world's second most 
used app store just a year ago. That was replaced with Windows Phone, at best 
the 8th 'best' ecosystem today, which still a year later has less than half the 
number of apps as Nokia currently still has on Ovi and Symbian. Whatever you 
thought of Ovi and Symbian 'failing' in apps, it is far worse on Windows Phone.
<br><br>
Reason 9 - the OS is deficient. The Windows Phone OS can seem exciting 
when first seen with its 'Tiles' but on short usage it reveals how limited and 
unfinished it is. The tech reviews after using Windows Phone (and Lumia) are 
quite consistent that Windows Phone is not yet ready for prime time. It may 
become so in the future, but its not yet nearly competitive with advanced OS 
platforms out there.<br>
<br>
Reason 10 - regressing on features and services. 
Where Nokia smartphones tended not to be the coolest and sexiest in recent 
years, at least Nokia was always known for stuffing every conceivable tech 
feature onto its flagship phones. The joke was, that to see what will be on the 
next iPhone model, just look at a 3 year old Nokia flagship. The Lumia is the 
first time ever, that Nokia has regressed in its features, severely. Not just 
pruning unnecessary tech 'bloat' but literally going back in tech, to specs 
that were normal on Nokia phones a year, two, even three years ago. That 
guarantees that any current owners of Nokia will find the Lumia a severe 
disappointment.<br>
<br>
Reason 11 - rejected by business/enterprise customers. 
I also discuss the enterprise/corporate side of the smartphone business. That 
market seems a great opportunity due to Microsoft Windows OS and Office Suite 
integration with Nokia smartphones. Except that this is nothing new. Nokia and 
Microsoft had done full Office Suite integration years ago and it helped Nokia 
and Microsoft sell... zero more smarpthones into the enterprise space.<br>
<br>

Reason 12 - poisoned carrier relationships with Nokia. The handset industry is 
different from the PC industry or home electronics, in that the 
carriers/operators decide which phone succeeds and which fails (witness the 
short-lived Microsoft Kin). Nokia used to have the platinum-standard carrier 
relationships a year ago. Those were burned by the CEO last year. Today Nokia's 
carrier relationships are the worst they have ever been.<br>
<br>
Reason 13 - 
poisoned carrier relationships with Microsoft. But even worse, is that 
Microsoft never used to have good carrier relationships. And yet, with Windows 
Phone, Microsoft's own departed exec admits Microsoft has been making those 
carrier relationships worse. So Nokia Lumia trades the best carrier 
relationships to bad ones, and then partners with the company with the worst 
relationships - that has been making them only worse last year.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

There is very much more in the article including aspects that are particular to 
the Emerging World (where half of all smartphones are now sold) and issues to 
such matters as build quality - Microsoft and Nokia have already admitted to 
two production quality problems with Lumia. Please read the article for all the 
details. But I said last February that the Microsoft adventure for Nokia was a 
high-risk gamble. Now we have seen what the Lumia is like, when managed by 
Stephen Elop, and it is an utter, comprehensive flop - on every single one of 
the 13 relevant issues that matter in the market success of smartphones. The 
Lumia series is doomed to fail. But please read the full analysis:&nbsp;<br>

<br>LETS START WITH CONSUMERS</p> 
<p><br>
 Smartphones (invented by Nokia four years before the Blackberry) 
first were enterprise/business tools. Then they became consumer gadgets (also 
invented by Nokia four years before before the iPhone). What is their 
proportion? Deutsche Bank counted in 2009 that the total global market for 
enterprise/business smartphones was 96 million handsets. The 
enterprise/business market is very stable over time, it will not be 
significantly over 100 million today, so enterprise smartphones account for 
roughy speaking 1 out of every 5 smartphones sold globally. And Blackberry 
obviously owns a lions's share of that market. So that is why I want to start 
with the consumer market where almost 4 out of 5 smartphones are sold.<br>
<br>

 What do we do with our smartphones. You will fling a couple of birds angrily 
at some pigs and no doubt say 'apps'. Maybe you will say 'surf the web'. Those 
sound very reasonable. So lets see what the facts say. (And lets ignore voice 
calls). So what else do we do? The most used aspect on our phones is not apps 
or web surfing. It is SMS text messaging. The second most used funtion is the 
camera. I don't say so. So says ComScore in 2011 - said 83% of Europeans and 
68% of US phone owners sent SMS text messages. 58% and 53% respectively used 
the camera. Web browser is far lower, at 33% for Europeans and 39% for 
Americans. Apps are even further down the list, 28% for Europeans and 34% for 
US consumers. And if you are curious about email or social networking, they 
come far below.<br>
<br>
 Is that SMS and camera emphasis perhaps an anomaly? 
No. Ofcom's global survey just in November 2011 reported that SMS was by far 
most used service in Europe and the USA, mobile web well below and apps further 
down the list. Consistently with the above. Ofcom did not ask about camera use, 
but did ask about picture sharing and MMS. They were used on par with mobile 
internet and far above apps. So Ofcom is consistent with ComScore that SMS and 
the camera come ahead of web and apps.<br>
<br>
 And lets be really really 
clear about this. If you don't trust them Europeans and want the Pew picture, 
we have that too. A global Pew survey in December 2011. In the USA, SMS used by 
67%, camera used by 57% and internet surfing by 43% (they did not ask about 
apps). In Europe Pew found in every country the same order, SMS most, camera 
second and web third.<br>
<br>
 These were major surveys of all mobile phone 
owners. How about specifically<em><strong>smartphone owners?</strong></em> Well 
we have that data too. Zokem surveyed 10,000 smartphone owners in 2011 in the 
USA and Europe and guess what was used most by smartphone users. SMS of course! 
But yes, apps and the mobile web had switched places (they did not ask about 
the camera).<br>
<br>
 Whatever we think of the smartphone buyer in the world, 
the target customer for potentially 4 out of 5 buyers of smartphones, the 
consumers, their number 1 interest is SMS text messaging. And yes, I am not 
saying that. It too was verified in 2011. Cloudtalk surveyed US smartphone 
owners in July and found 71% used SMS and only 40% used the mobile web (they 
didn't ask about apps). Note again how consistent the finding is with the 
above. But Cloudtalk asked what one thing smartphone owners would most want to 
improve -<em><strong>90% of US smartphone owners said they would want better 
SMS text messaging!</strong></em><br>
<br>
 REASON 1 - MESSAGING MADNESS<br>

<br> Did I make my case? Now is Microsoft the expert on SMS? No. The world's 
first person-to-person SMS text message was sent in Finland in 1993 on the 
Radiolinja GSM network from one Nokia phone to another, by a Nokia employee 
Riku Pihkonen. Nokia wrote the book on SMS. Even the inventor of SMS, Matti 
Makkonen finished his career at Nokia (he was my last mentor). And what has 
been a major feature of Nokia smartphones always - a high proportion of them 
have had physical QWERTY keyboards in several formats such as the folder (ie 
Communciator format) and slider and Blackberry style wide candybar. There even 
have been exotic QWERTY form factors like the butterfly keyboard. If anything, 
Nokia was known as the brand that did SMS texting just about as well as it 
could be done.<br>
<br>
 Did Nokia bother to put a QWERTY keyboard onto its 
first three Lumia phones? No! Note, this is a Nokia competitive advantage. 
Note, 90% of<em><strong>American smartphone owners</strong></em> wish this <em>
<strong>more than anything else</strong></em>, and its something for example 
<em><strong>Apple refuses to do</strong></em> with the iPhone. But no. Lumia 
series is pure touch screen only. Nokia had a massive competitive advantage 
that it simply refused to exploit. And is this relevant? NPD reported in 2010 
that 46% of all mobile phone handsets sold in the USA had a QWERTY keyboard 
either as its sole input or combined with a touch screen input. Nokia 
voluntarily abandons nearly half of the addressable market and instead - forces,
<em><strong>FORCES all Lumias to be compared to iPhones</strong></em> (rather 
than compared to Blackberries).<br>
<br>
 Then we have the SMS design flaw. 
Microsoft has already admitted that it is true, if anyone sends a specific 
string SMS text message (or FB message or Tweet) to a Microsoft Phone based 
smartphone - it will shut down the phone and when the phone is turned back on, 
the messaging function is inoperable and the only fix is to wipe out everything 
stored on the phone - all messages, pictures, phonebook etc. What moron moron 
moron didn't prioritize SMS and allowed this kind of failure at Microsoft? This 
would not have happened if the phone and its software was designed by adults. 
SMS is the most valued and most used service on mobile phones in every market - 
even the USA is now in that state, so said the USA's own CTIA the Cellular 
Telecoms Industry Association in 2009.<br>
<br>
 REASON 2 - CAMERA CATASTROPHY
<br> <br>
 So lets go to Nokia's second huge advantage against all competitors 
outside of Japan and South Korea domestic markets. The camera. Nokia partnered 
with German camera optics specialists Carl Zeiss, and from the early N-Series 
on, Nokia had far and away the best cameraphones in that part of the planet 
where 98% of its population lives (Japan and South Korea have exceptionally 
advanced domestic mobile phone markets). Nokia introduced the world's first 
optical zoom (ie real zoom) camera lens in 2006. The first Xenon ie real flash 
in 2007. Nokia had a 5 megapixel camera when the iPhone was introduced with 
only 2 megapixels. Nokia did the (non Japan/non-S Korea) world's first 8mp 
cameraphone and first 12mp cameraphone. And its not just megapixels. Nokia had 
better glass on its optics, better sensors in the camera and better software 
for the pictures. Plus Nokia had removable storage media ie microSD cards so 
you could shoot many hours of DVD quality video and then just swap your microSD 
card and continue shooting. The whole camera and video experience was always 
superior on Nokia. Nokia introduced TV out in 2006 meaning you could watch your 
pictures, websites, videos etc on your home TV. And today that is of course 
HDMI out.<br>
<br>
 This is the second most used ability of the mobile phone. 
We just heard from Christmas electronics sales in the USA, that digital camera 
sales and videocam sales had fallen catastrophically - because consumers were 
switching their camera and video capture to their smartphones. And this is a 
Nokia superiority. And what does Lumia offer. A<em><strong>massive downgrade
</strong></em> to what Nokia used to have. The 2010 flagship Nokia smartphone, 
the N8, had a 12 mp camera and Xenon flash. It won every contest and comparison 
against every rival everywhere, a superb cameraphone and videocam phone. It was 
selected the phone of the year in Britain. And the N8 was that cameraphone used 
to shoot a full-length motion picture that had a commercial release. Yes. A 
Nokia cameraphone so good a professional movie maker made not an 'experimental 
film' for a film festival, or a short film, or amateur film, but a full 
commercial production movie for cinematic release. That is Nokia excellence in 
cameras.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What does Lumia have? The topmost Lumia900 that was announced at CES has 
its camera downgraded from the N8. It doesn't have 12mp. It has 8mp. The flash 
is not Xenon flash. It is LED flash. There is no TV out. There is no HDMI out. 
There is no microSD. This 'flagship' phone seems like it was designed by total 
amateurs who were somehow utterly ignorant of the vast competence Nokia had 
built over the past decade. And it is. The Lumia series was not designed by 
Nokia top engineers in Finland. Elop in his Microsoft Madness decided not to 
use Nokia's Finland based competence, he went to the USA to design his Lumia 
phones. Yes the USA, known for such fantastic global hit phones as the Palm, 
the Danger, the HP, the Compaq, the Motorola - anyone remember the Rokr - and 
yes, Microsoft's own magnificent Kin, the phone so disasterous, it was 
terminated 6 weeks after launch.<br>
<br>
 Nokia's flagship phones have always, 
always had the best cameraphones (Japan, S Korea blah-blah-blah). The Lumia 
series is the first time ever that Nokia not only was not the best cameraphone, 
but it actually regressed. If you like your cameraphone, you are better off 
buying a 1 year old N8 than any of the brand new Lumia phones. The N8 was so 
good, that the first side-by-side test with HTC's Titan II - with a 16mp 
camera, and the N8 produced better pictures. That is Nokia knowhow! And Lumia? 
Abandons it all.<br>
<br>
 WHAT DO CUSTOMERS WANT IN THEIR NEXT PHONE</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We have seen what consumers do with their smartphones. Now, what about 
specific decision criteria. All those who say 'but the eco-system, Tomi!' That 
the smartphone OS will decide. Or the number of apps in the app store. Sure 
they will be important, sure. But lets go to the facts again.<br>
<br>
 TNS 
surveyed 34,000 mobile phone owners around the world and found that in the 
Industrialized World (North America, Europe, Advanced Asia-Pacific) apps and 
the OS do matter. They came in ranked.. fifth. Tied for fifth. What is ahead of 
the selection of apps and the operating system in selecting smartphones in the 
Industrialized World? The Look and Feel. The Brand of Handset. The Input 
Method. And the Model of Handset. This is not me saying the OS is not top on 
the mind of smarpthone buyers, or the number of apps in the app store. This is 
what smartphone owners in the USA, Britain, Spain, Australia, Germany, France, 
Canada, Singapore etc have said. So before I discuss the OS and the Apps, lets 
do the more important factors starting from the top.<br>
<br>
 REASON 3 - DOES 
NOT WIN ON LOOK AND FEEL<br>
<br>
 Look. The Lumia 900 and Lumia 800 do look 
like flagship phones and have won plenty of praise, copying Nokia's radical 
look of the N9 from last year. So yes, this is a brave attempt. But the Lumia 
710 has a decidedly cheap look to it, very plasticky. But yes, what of the 
flagship(s). If you like QWERTY form factors ie a slider or Blackberry style 
smarpthone, then this look is wrong for you. The sad thing is, that usually 
with new lines, Nokia has done a pair, ie the N8 was the tablet style pure 
touch screen, and its sister model was the E7 with the QWERTY slider. Same with 
the N9 (pure touch screen) and its sister the N950 (with QWERTY slider). So 
while Nokia had every chance to gain an advantage on the look side, it 
voluntarily abandoned about half of the total market potential. By deciding not 
to make what is a competitive advantage at Nokia.<br>
<br>
 But if you do love 
the pure slab tablet style pure touch screen smartphone. Then yes, the Lumia 
900 and Lumia 800 are good-looking smartphones,<em><strong>but not as good as 
the iPhone 4S</strong></em> while being in the same price range. The big screen 
on the Lumia 900 is nice, but far bigger screens are on current Androids 
including the monster screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note. And where Nokia 
previously did have near retina display pixel density on the E90 Communicator, 
Nokia has again regresssed and now both Lumia 900 and Lumia 800 fall far short 
of the Retina Display sharpness of even the year-old iPhone 4. If you really 
love your QWERTY look, you won't even consider these Lumias. If you do love 
this purist touch screen look - then you will buy.. the iPhone or the Galaxy.
<br> <br>
 And while we are on the look, what about those weird neon colors? 
Yes, obviously the Lumia will stand out in the crowd, but it will soon mean 
that Lumia owners will be ashamed to show their phones. No wonder that one of 
the US carriers refused to offer the glaring color options. What happened to 
subtle and stylish? Nokia knows how to do that. But these colors are garish.<br>
<br> Feel. What of the feel? Nokia has a history of truly exceptional feel to 
its top phones. The perfection in the camera shutter on the N93 or the 
precision of the hinges on the E90 Communicator or the sheer delight of 
engineering bliss that is the slider/folder motion in the E7. Nokia could have 
given us great feel on the mechanics - where Nokia excels far above all other 
handset makers. But it did not. The Windows Phone OS forces the standard 
buttons on the touch screen that crowd out part of the screen permanently and 
the other controls are pretty lame. Again, Nokia abandons what is its 
competitive advantage in a futile attemp to match the iPhone. For anyone who 
actually owns an iPhone will not play long with the Lumia in the store, before 
knowing the iPhone is a far better buy (if you already are an iPhone owner).<br>
<br> The Look and Feel will be above average definitely but not on par with the 
top phones by the rivals. And when the price is about the same, on the look and 
feel, the Lumia is the clear loser already in the store.<em><strong>All 
consumer reviews by the tech press say that the Lumia 800 fails head-to-head 
against the iPhone 4S or Samsung Galaxy etc,</strong></em> and the Lumia 900 
doesn't bring anything better on its look and feel.<br>
<br>
 REASON 4 - FAILS 
ON NOKIA BRAND<br>
<br>
So the second highest factor deciding which smartphone 
normal consumers buy, is brand. Nokia had failed in the US market, so the Nokia 
brand cannot help Microsoft in the US market, that would need to be the other 
way around. In the USA Nokia is a bargain-basement cheapo-phone brand and the 
US market hasn't even seen most of Nokia's recent flagship smartphones like the 
N9, the E7, the N900, the E90 Communicator, the N86 etc. So in the USA, on this 
Lumia partnership, the conventional wisdom says that the Microsoft brand will 
help restore Nokia (on the Brand).</p> 
<p><br>
 What usually totally surprises US based readers is how strong Nokia 
is outside of the USA. In the Global Brand survey of 2010 by Interbrand, Nokia 
finished 8th best brand ahead of such icons as Rolls Royce, Rolex, Mercedes 
Benz, Porsche etc. It was no fluke. Nokia had been in the top 10 for the past 
decade, as high as 4th best brand in the world. In practically every country 
outside of North America, Nokia was the top phone brand as recently as 2010. 
Usually with a huge margin.<br>
<br>
 Does it matter? Lets look at specific 
consumer opinion. A survey of nearly 2,000 consumers of the UK mobile phone 
market by Right Mobile Phone found that the mobile phone brand is more 
influential in deciding the next phone, than the carrier/operator brand. And<em>
<strong> in the UK, Nokia was the phone brand with the highest loyalty</strong>
</em> (not the iPhone or Blackberry which were a lot in the news for big market 
gains). How good was Nokia sales in the UK in 2010? Nokia's market share of new 
sales in the summer of 2010 in Britain was 33% according to Kantar. That was 
the best market share of any smartphone maker in Britain. iPhone came second 
and Blackberry third. This bodes very well for Nokia and Lumia as these 
customers are coming in to replace their smartphones now in 2012.<br>
<br>
 
Except that something wild happened between 2010 and today. Nokia did not make 
an utterly failing phone like the N97 or one with a technical error like the 
Antennagate of the iPhone 4. The rivals did not come in 2011 with superphones 
with unbelievable features like say time travel or teleportation. Nokia gave 
ever better phones with better features (E7, X7, N9) and the Symbian OS 
released ever better editions and the Nokia Ovi store became the 
second-bestselling app store and everything was improving at Nokia. I am NOT 
saying Nokia had somehow magically caught up with the iPhone but<em><strong>the 
fact is, Nokia had a record Christmas Quarter in 2010, and then things were 
improving for 2011</strong></em>. Improving! This for the brand that had 
highest loyalty in Britain at the time!<br>
<br>
So what happened to Nokia 
sales in Britain in 12 months. Kantar gives Nokia's market share in the summer 
of 2011 as .. 11%. Nokia had been the market share leader, with the best 
loyalty in the nation, and then produced ever better phones including one of 
Britain's best smartphones of the year - and its rivals did nothing spectacular 
- remembering the iPhone 4 had already been released by summer 2010 and the 4S 
was delayed till Autumn 2011. And Blackberry had its dramatic market failure in 
this period. Yet Nokia lost two thirds of its customers in just one year. What 
happened?<br>
<br>
 The British know what is the Ratner Effect and what is the 
Osborne Effect. Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop decided that one utter communciation 
disaster like Ratner Effect is not enough, he compounded it with an Osborne 
Effect. Both of those communication disasters independently ruined their 
respective companies, Ratners and Osborne. Elop doubled down and made the most 
costly management communciation fiasco in the economic history of mankind and 
devastated Nokia's brand and market demand. He combined the Osborne Effect with 
the Ratner Effect in something I now call theElop Effect. Elop single-handedly 
wiped out Nokia's demand in February 2011. He ruined Nokia's brand.<br>
<br>
 
Its not limited to Britain, obviously. Kantar reported the same crash of Nokia 
smartphone new sales in all European markets. Similar stats come from all 
around the world and obviously Nokia's own reported smartphone unit sales tell 
the same morose tale. In 2010 Nokia grew smartphone sales by 47% from the year 
before. Elop took that growth and torpedoed it, and for 2011 Nokia global 
market share collapsed from 29% in Q4 of 2010 to about 12% in Q4 of 2011 (we 
will know when Nokia releases its Q4 results shortly). This happened while the 
global smartphone industry exploded in 2011 growing by 59% from the year before.
<br> <br>
 Nokia brand is sheer garbage today. So the second most important 
thing customers ask for, which was a strong Nokia asset, has been ruined not by 
manufacturing errors or market forces, by Nokia's CEO with his idiotic 
communications last February. So maybe we can find salvage from the Microsoft 
side of this partnership. Or maybe not.<br>
<br>
 REASON 5 - FAILS ALSO ON 
WINDOWS BRAND<br>
<br>
 Microsoft is a strong brand. The Office Suite and some 
of its components like Word, Excel and Powerpoint are clear market leaders in 
their fields. The Xbox brand is strong. But Windows.<em><strong>Windows is not 
a loved brand</strong></em>. Windows is synonymous with crashes, bugs, delays, 
incompatibilty, viruses, spyware and tedious updates. Windows is why people 
talk of the 'Microsoft Minute' in the delays to boot up a PC. The term Internet 
Exploder came more as mocking Windows crashes than IE the browser crashing.<br>

<br> So Windows is a most unfortunate decision in branding. And the irony is, 
that Microsoft decided to<em><strong>rebrand</strong></em> its smartphone 
operating system when it switched away from Windows Mobile. Microsoft could 
have called the new OS anything. Microsoft Seven. Microsoft Mobile. Microsoft 
Phone. Xbox Phone. Zune Mobile, Internet Smartphoner. XPhone, Ballmerphone, 
Redmondo. Or just about anything other than Windows. But no, they called it 
Windows Phone. So now the new Microsoft smartphone OS has the worst branding 
baggage out of the whole Microsoft empire. What a dumb move.<br>
<br>
 But 
Branding is far more than the name of the brand. Lets see how strong the 
Windows brand is in smartphones. Lets go to the USA, its home market. In Q2 of 
2009 Windows smartphones in the USA had 9.7% market share according to Gartner. 
One year later in Q2 of 2010, that had fallen to 4.6% !!! Note, at this time, 
Microsoft smartphones were made by Samsung, LG and Motorola - the top 3 
bestselling phone brands of the USA - which did NOT experience a significant 
change in their market shares! Same for HTC, the pure smartphone maker. It too 
made Windows Mobile smartphones and it also did not see a fall, on the 
contrary, HTC saw a growth in the USA on its market share.<br>
<br>
 How is 
that possible? These four smartphone makers also make Android smartphones. And 
in Microsoft's best country market - the USA - when supported by each of the 
three bestselling phone brands of the US, and its biggest non-proprietary 
smartphone brand HTC - yet<strong><em>Microsoft's Windows brand was so 
poisonous, that half of its customer base churned away from Microsoft.</em>
</strong> That is not a highly loved brand.<br>
<br>
 So that was the 'old' 
Microsoft Mobile. What of the brand-spanking new Windows Phone brand then? 
Windows Phone launched in 2010 We've now had over a year of its 'success' and 
Kantar reported that the combined sales of Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 
based smartphones in the USA dropped by half again, from 2010 to 2011. Yes, 
even while switching to the newer OS, and giving it more than a year for 'ramp 
up'<strong><em>Microsoft lost again half of what customers remained. This is a 
brand which is not loved.</em></strong><br>
<br>
 The global picture tells the 
same story. Windows Phone had its peak sales a year ago of about 1.5 million 
smartphones in the quarter. Last quarter we have data for, Q3, Windows Phone 
sales had fallen to about 500,000 units worldwide. The Microsoft Windows Phone 
is not a strong brand in smartphones and neither is Nokia. For the second most 
important factor for smartphone buyers, the brand - both brands are so 
poisonous, this is the classic comment, two turkeys do not an eagle make. No 
matter how much lipstick you put on a pig, it is still a pig. Or polishing shit 
is still shit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>REASON 6 - FAILS ON INPUT</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The iPhone revolutionized smartphones. The multitouch interface, on 
capacitive touch screen, and Apple's brilliant, logical and intuitive software 
system, all worked. It was inherently better. That is what you need if you want 
a competitive advantage. Else if you do touch screen, you are just another 
rival. Nokia's N9 and N950 on the MeeGo OS, with its radical swype method of 
input, is a major step. The Windows Phone input is not a radical improvement. 
In fact, it has severe shortcomings with no foldering, so the more you install 
apps, the more cluttered and clumsy it becomes. So the touch screen input is no 
better than any rivals, and is worse than the best. Nobody will buy the Lumia 
because its touch screen is superior.<br>
<br>
 And where are the QWERTY 
inputs. Nokia failed the opportunity to do something Apple doesn't. To be a 
viable option for the nearly half of consumers who do insist on a physical 
QWERTY keyboard on their phones. The sad fact is, that on QWERTY the keyboard 
on the E7 is truly magnificent. So it would have been an easy selling attribute 
for anyone trialling a Lumia in a store. But no. No QWERTY keyboards. Even 
though Nokia designed three very similar spec smartphones (and Nokia has tons 
of QWERTY phones on Symbian, S40 and MeeGo operating systems).<br>
<br>
 REASON 
7 - FAILS<em><strong> VARIETY</strong></em> IN MODEL OF HANDSET<br>
<br>
 The 
fourth most important factor is the<em><strong>model</strong></em> of the 
smartphone handset of any given brand. And here again, Nokia has the biggest 
production capacity. Nokia has the widest range of components and suppliers. 
Nokia can do the broadest product portfolio. Just like in cars, consumer 
preferences in mobile phones are very diverse. Someone prefers a Cadillac 
Escallade, another prefers a Toyota Prius. Someone prefers a Mercedes Benz 
C-Series, another prefers a Porsche 911. Someone else wants a pickup truck, or 
a minivan or a Smart Car. Apple makes its iPhones very similar to each other. 
Nokia is able to stretch its range to suit very divergent needs. If one of its 
three Lumia models is aimed to be an iPhone 'killer' then make the other two as 
different and all three quite distinct from each other. When you look at the 
Lumia 900, it is like the designer of the Lumia 800 fell asleep. Where is the 
difference. Even the Lumia 710 is just a cheaper lame version of the Lumia 800. 
This is the desperation move by the small rival who tries by a few cosmetic 
tricks to expand its product line.<br>
<br>
 Compare to Nokia's biggest rival 
(who is not Apple's iPhone, it is obviously Samsung). Samsung does just on its 
Galaxy series the obvious iPhone clone basic slab touch screen versions of 
almost exactly iPhone physical size; and then offers the Galaxy Indulge with 
the QWERTY slider; the Galaxy Beam with the pico projector; and the Galaxy Note 
with its gigantic screen. Thats how you do differentiation. But no. Nokia which 
could easily do this, rather has made three variations of one boring theme.<br>

<br> But again, its even worse. Why is Nokia Lumia not on every network in 
every country? Nokia has easily the production capacity and the world's largest 
phone sales network and distribution system including the ability to air ship a 
million phones a day, every day, anywhere it needs to. So lets take again just 
the USA. T-Mobile will sell the Lumia 710 but not the 800 or 900. AT&amp;T will 
sell the Lumia 900 as an exclusive. The other big US carriers are not selling 
any Lumia handsets this Spring. So, in a perfect world, Nokia could sell 3 
handsets on four networks ie 12 variations for the consumer. Now Nokia only 
offers 2 of those 12. If you want the Lumia 900, you can only get it on 
AT&amp;T. If you want the Lumia 710, you can only get it on T-Mobile. And the 
Lumia 800? Gotta fly to Europe to get that.<br>
<br>
 It is perfectly possible 
that Nokia and Microsoft marketing have convinced a random customer that they 
do want the Nokia Lumia smartphone. And that customer most likely went online 
somewhere to see what model they want. And then went to their carrier store, to 
buy it.<em><strong>And in 10 times out of 12, the carrier will not offer the 
Lumia which the customer would want</strong></em>. Then - while the customer 
WOULD be willing to prioritize the brand of phone (Nokia) ahead of the exact 
model - in these cases, there is no other Nokia smartphone to sell (because 
idiot Elop decided to pull all Symbian phones from the shelves in the USA, and 
worse - refuses to sell the magnificent N9 and N950 which run on the MeeGo 
operating system). So. If the customer wants a specific model, and that is not 
sold by that carrier,<strong><em>the facts tell us that the smartphone customer 
would be willing to buy another Lumia or even another Nokia smartphone</em>
</strong> - except that because of management madness, there are no others. It 
may be to Microsoft's advantage that the customer doesn't buy a MeeGo or 
Symbian based smartphone - but that customer will then go to another brand - 
and in 9 times out o 10, it will be either an iPhone or an Android. And in any 
case, if a customer wanting a Nokia branded phone, is not walking out of the 
store with a Nokia branded phone, that is a lost customer to Nokia (and gain to 
Apple or Android). Elop's 'strategy' is totally not in Nokia's best interest.
<br> <br>
 REASON 8 - FAILS SMARTPHONE APPS AND APP STORE<br>
<br>
 The 
smartphone apps portfolio is ranked only tied for 5th/6th highest priority for 
buyers of new smartphones. Note that all of the above come ahead of your 
precious app store. But then, come on. Windows Phone app store? It has only 
passed 50,000 apps. Even the 'burning platforms obsolete' Symbian based Nokia 
(Ovi) app store has twice that in apps. Android is 8 times bigger, Apple iPhone 
App Store is literally 10 times bigger. If you walk into the store with the 
apps as your decision criterion, then Windows Phone fails from the start. And 
that is not even before we look at the apps. The reviews of WP7 apps say rather 
consistently that they are poor versions of their iPhone and Android masters, 
and further, that they do not take advantage of WP7's abilities.<br>
<br>
 
These will get better over time. But the application developers' interest in 
making apps is totally dependent on their belief that its worth their while. 
Once they bother to count, to do the basic math, and see that there are about 
190 million Android users worldwide, about 120 million iPhone users (and about 
170 million iOS users when we add iPad and iPod Touch); and over 300 million 
Symbian users; and about 100 million Blackberry users - and only about 5 
million Windows Phone users. Yes. The total installed base of Windows Phone 
today, about a year and a half from launch is... under one percent of the 
smartphones in use worldwide. Under one percent. Less than 1%. This is when the 
futility of bothering to create WP7 versions becomes obvious. Microsoft has 
been able to peddle thesheer impossibility of a 'third ecosystem' - which even 
Microsoft loyalists would not have believed considering how ridiculous are 
Ballmer-oriented claims about Microsoft's future - but they suddenly believed 
it, when the Nokia CEO said the same.<br>
<br>
 Please do the math. We just 
heard from Morgan Stanley that they project Nokia and Microsoft to sell 37 
million Lumia phones this year 2012 and 64 million Lumia smartphones next year 
2013. This forecast by Morgan Stanley is quite optimistic. But lets assume it 
truly happens. Those numbers sound great, don't they. That is awesome, isn't it.
<br> <br>
 So by December 2013, the world will have about 111 million Windows 
Phone smartphones in use. Yes. That might sound good. Except that in December 
2013 the world will have about two BILLION smartphones in use (we will see 
about 700 million sold this year alone). So, even three years from now, the 
Microsoft Windows Phone OS family will have only about 5% market share. That is 
not a third ecosystem in anyone's book. And Android will be over a Billion 
smartphones. Where is the developer attention going to go. Understand that even 
in 2013, Symbian will utterly tower over Windows Phone in installed base. So 
Apps will not win the battle for Lumia.<br>
<br>
 REASON 9 - DEFICIENT 
OPERATING SYSTEM<br>
<br>
 The Windows Phone 7 and 7.5 Operating Systems do 
look cool and sexy when shown on stage or briefly demo'ed. But all experts who 
have reviewed Windows Phone have immediately pointed out that they are not even 
up to modern standards yet, far less being in any way 'leading edge' 
technology. The tiles are a gimmick but mostly are only an update of Widgets 
that have existed on such 'burning platforms obsolete' operating systems as 
Nokia's Symbian. Windows Phone does do multitasking, but only just. For example 
the phone will not wake up from the alarm. So you buy yourself a Lumia and then 
set it up to wake you for the next day to go to work - and will have a severe 
'I hate Nokia' moment when your phone rings silently without waking you up. 
What is with that?<br>
<br>
 The camera utility is limited and restricted. 
Windows Phone 7 doesn't even support dual cameras (that came with 7.5). There 
are many application developer issues that are not supported - like the hottest 
area right now, Augmented Reality. Nokia's past flagship phones have proudly 
done AR, but not these Lumias. And there is no support for NFC. And you cannot 
transfer apps and various content via bluetooth etc. The system is very 
restrictive and limiting.<br>
<br>
 What is worse, the next update to Windows 
Phone is aimed at the cheapest phones, so the flagships cannot even catch up to 
the rivals with the next Windows Phone release. This is the Microsoft way. The 
short term allure of the Tiles does provide some in-store excitement. But when 
smartphone users start to use the Lumia, they soon are frustrated and 
disappointed. Again this is not me saying. I have not used a Lumia or any 
Windows Phone based smartphone. But the Guardian tech writer who bought a Lumia 
800 in the UK before Christmas,was so fed up with it already after Christmas 
when using it, he returned the smartphone - and wrote in one of Britain's 
biggest newspapers that its what he did. This is not proof of an OS that is 
ready for prime time. It may become that one day, but it is not competitive 
yet. This is probably more like Windows 2.0 (remember that, ouch ouch ouch) 
than Windows 3.0 which finally was the first Windows on the PC that was 
(barely) usable.<br>
<br>
 Not everybody will return Lumias. But it will see 
more returns than its peers. That poisons the reputation both for friends 
recommending smartphones and the sales reps at the stores. The sales reps hate 
returns - because the customer has to be sold another model smartphone - but 
the sales rep won't get a new commission. And then the rep has to do the 
returns paperwork and packaging hassles. Three times the effort for zero more 
commission - while the customer bitches and moans and gives the sales rep a bad 
day. So the sales reps learn real fast which phones have high return rates - 
and stop selling them!<br>
<br>
 REASON 10 - REGRESSING IN FEATURES AND SERVICES
<br> <br>
 And the last of the major decision criteria in the Industrialized 
World for selecting smartphones is the features and services offering. And 
Nokia is known for a lot in this area. Nokia smartphones used to come with a 
huge array of pre-loaded apps and the devices were overloaded with 
technological goodies. If the iPhone was sexy and slick, and the Nokia was more 
bulky and unsexy, at least the Nokia had every conceivable tech built in, and 
several more you didn't even know existed.<br>
<br>
 I'll be the first to admit 
most consumers won't use most features and in recent years the smartphones have 
become so complex, even expert users couldn't work all parts of their phones. 
So it was overkill on many levels. But for some consumers - remember this is 
only the 7th most important priority - they have their 'check lists'. Does this 
phone have LTE. What resolution is video recording. Which file standards does 
the media player support. Etc etc etc. And then there is the specialist need. 
Like the customer who has had a previous Nokia and loved that its FM 
transmitter lets you connect to your car without an iPod cable connector. Or 
perhaps the customer has a collection of movies transferred to microSD memory 
cards, or whatever.<br>
<br>
 So lets see how technologically advanced the 
Lumia 800 is, the flagship currently available - the Lumia 900 will release 
only on AT&amp;T late in the spring about the time when we expect the iPhone 5 
to launch.<br>
<br>
 So, Lumia 800? Compared to Nokia's previous flagships and 
current rivals. The Lumia 800 has only 8 mp camera regressed from 12 mp in N8 a 
year before. The market leader now has 16mp (HTC). The screen size is 3.7 
inches, which is regressed from 4 inches on the E90 Communicator four years 
ago. Current market leader Samsung Note has 5.3 inch screen. There is no slot 
for any kind of memory card which is regressing from the microSD slot in the N8 
that supported 32 GB memory cards. Today top phones support at least 64 GB 
microSD (and probably even bigger). The Lumia 800 doesn't support video calling 
(Gosh, how far back can I go, I think it was the 6680 back about 2004 that 
first had videocalling support and every Nokia flagship has had it since.. 
except not now the Lumia. And obviously, after even Apple added videocalling 
support to the iPhone 4, essentially every rival (not using WP7) does 
videocalls.<br>
<br>
 The flash on the Lumia 800 is LED, the first Nokia 
flagships to go better was the N95 and N82 in 2007 with Xenon flash. Several 
better cameraphones have it now. The Lumia doesn't have FM radio, Nokia added 
it gosh, years ago, about 2005. Many rivals have FM Radio today. The Lumia 800 
doesn't support Real Media player files (that will play well with web services 
haha). Real Player was standard on Nokia phones still last year and most rivals 
support the file format. The Bluetooth on the Lumia 800 won't support many 
types of file transfers, it did on past Nokias and does today on rival phones. 
The Lumia 800 doesn't have a QR code reader installed. Nokia put it on its 
flagship first in 2006 on the N93. Most rival smartphones have QR code readers.
<br> <br>
 Lumia 800 doesn't have TV out, that came to Nokia flagships in the 
N93 in 2006 and many rivals have it. The Lumia 800 doesn't support HDMI out 
which came to Nokia on the E7, and now some top rivals do it too. The Lumia 800 
doesn't read USB thumb drives and memory sticks. Nokia introduced this 
fantastic feature on the N900 in 2009 (note, yes, read thumb drives and other 
USB memory devices including portable hard drives making the smartphone behave 
just like a real laptop). I don't know if other smartphones support this 
function yet but obviously Nokia has brought it to newer phones like the E7.<br>
<br> And the Lumia 800 doesn't offer a replacable battery. Nokia has started on 
that dumb path already earlier under Elop with the N8 being the first Nokia 
smartphone that didn't let users replace the battery. Considering how heavily 
smartphones can be used on some days this is a huge disadvantage, especially 
for power users who surf the web, use WiFi, shoot video, play music, watch 
YouTube videos etc etc etc. Luckily Elop has seen the error of his way and now 
starting with the Lumia 710 the practise is ending, but there are still phones 
in the pipeline that don't allow battery changes - like the Lumia 900.<br>
<br>

 This is<em><strong>Nokia's current 'flagship' which fails in side-by-side 
comparisons on many widely used and desired features and specs - with its Nokia 
brothers from years ago!</strong></em> Years ago! How badly is the Lumia 800 
regressing ! It seems like it was deliberately designed to fail in the market.
<br> <br>
 We have looked at how consumers use smartphones, and what are 
currently the top things that decide which smartphone we buy next.<em><strong>
By every SINGLE criterion, Nokia Lumia is underperforming the market</strong>
</em>- and on most it is regressing from where Nokia was before Lumia. If you 
thought the Nokia of the past was 'obsolete' for your market, whether that was 
the USA or Europe or Asia-Pacific or wherever, this Lumia line offers you 
NOTHING that is better but on TEN separate factors, Lumia is now worse than 
what Nokia was last year. WORSE.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>REASON 11 - REJECTED BY BUSINESS / ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS<br>
<br>
 So that 
was consumers. Many will be eager to argue the synergies of Windows and Office 
Suite at the enterprise/corporate customers. And drool at the amazing 
opportunity that Nokia business-oriented E-Series smartphones can have with 
full Microsoft Office integration. The massive global market share dominance 
that Windows and Office have in the workplace. This must be Lumia's big market 
and Tomi is a total fool to not see it. Yes. Total fool.<br>
<br>
 First, 
remember that only 1 in 5 smartphones sold worldwide is a business/enterprise 
smartphone. Secondly, remember that Blackberry owns roughly speaking half of 
that. Before we get into massive argument about Blackberry is dying, hear this: 
&nbsp;A 2011 survey of 20,000 businesses in the USA by TNS, found that 
Blackberry penetration ranged from 61% to 81%. Six out of every ten smartphones 
was a Blackberry in tiny US businesses of less than 4 employees and 8 out of 
ten smartphones was a Blackberry in the biggest corporations of 1,000 employees 
or more. The myth of the iPhone replacing the Blackberry is, alas, quite 
premature. The statistics of smartphone sales reflect that too. Blackberry is 
collapsing in consumer sales in the USA, yes, that is true (but growing 
internationally) but the enterprises are replacing their smartphones rather 
loyally, Berry by Berry.<br>
<br>
 And before you say 'Windows' - the second 
most popular smartphone in US businesses - Microsoft's home country and 
Microsoft's Windows PC and Office Suite penetration's best country by far - is 
not Windows, not Windows Mobile nor Windows Phone. It is yes, the iPhone. If 
Microsoft Windows was such a magical synergy tool, why is the consumer-oriented 
iPhone outselling the Windows smartphones in the US enterprise/corporate space, 
after a DECADE of Windows Mobile / Windows Phone sales by Microsoft and its 
partners. There is no synergy.<br>
<br>
 Which brings us to the Nokia Magic 
with Microsoft Office Suite integration. So what if we really do put the full 
Microsoft compatibility to E-Series? Surely that is the magic potion. Haha. You 
know what? That was already done. Not last year. Not in 2010 when Elop joined 
Nokia as its CEO. No. Microsoft and Nokia did full E-Series and Microsoft 
Office Suite and other Microsoft software business/enterprise integration in... 
2009. And the big corporate/enterprise clients they landed in the next years? 
None. None. And you know who was in charge of that project on Microsoft's side? 
Stephen Elop thats who. Rather than achieve corporate sales successes for their 
'strategic partnership' Elop rather prepared his job transfer from Microsoft to 
become CEO of Nokia the next year.<br>
<br>
 So today ANY Symbian phone can do 
full Microsoft Office fully and all its peripherals and apps. Including Skype 
(Windows Phone does not support Skype). Symbian supports such vital business 
needs as.. folder (Windows Phone does not) and full multitasking and the 
transfers of apps and files via bluetooth. So doing your Microsoft business 
solution is far better on a Symbian E-Series phone than with Windows Phone! 
Remember, the old Windows Mobile was built to be business-oriented (as was 
Symbian originally). But Windows Phone was built to be the iPhone-killer - so 
admit Microsoft execs now - and it was made to be a consumer-oriented 
smartphone OS, not a business-oriented OS.<em><strong> If you seriously believe 
that Microsoft can win enterprise/corporate customers of any meaningful degree 
with Nokia, you are deluding yourself.</strong></em><br>
<br>
And this is all 
without considering the natural need of enterprise/business phones - keyboards! 
Why is every Blackberry and every Nokia E-Series carrying a full QWERTY 
keyboard? That is what enterprise/business customers want. Why is Lumia not 
offering a QWERTY variant!<br>
<br>
No, Lumia will not do better than Nokia did 
before with E-Series on Symbian and E-Series on Symbian is more 
Microsoft-friendly and enterprise/corporate user friendly than Lumia using 
Windows Phone. Whatever success or lack therof, you have seen of Nokia in the 
business/enterprise space, that will do worse on Lumia and Windows Phone, not 
better.<br>
<br>
 And finally on the enterprise/business users. The Microsoft 
loyalty and brand was equally demolished with the catastrophic crash of its 
market from 10% in the US market in 2009 to 5% in 2010 to under about 1% today 
(when adding both Windows Mobile AND Windows Phone). So don't delude yourself 
into thinking that Lumia can somehow grow on the enterprise/corporate client 
side, either in the USA or the rest of the world. If Microsoft was the magic 
potion - surely Nokia should have been able to capitalize on it in 2009 and 
2010 before Elop decided to set his platforms on fire like the psychotic 
arsonist.<br>
<br>
 WHAT OF EMERGING WORLD ?<br>
<br>
 Hey, that was only half 
of the world of smartphone sales. The planet has a population of 7 Billion who 
have 5.9 Billion mobile phone accounts. Only 1.2 Billion people live in the 
Industrialized World and all of the above only related to what is called 'The 
West'. What of the Emerging World where 5.8 Billion people live, where 75% of 
all mobile phones are sold, and now half of all smartphones are sold. China 
overtook the USA as the biggest individual country market for smartphones last 
year. India is rapidly growing into another giant as is Indonesia, Russia, 
Brazil etc.<br>
<br>
 First, most of the points in the above apply to the 
Emerging World but in perhaps different orders of priority. So for example the 
TNS global survey of 34,000 mobile phone owners worldwide on their purchase 
priorities with mobile phones, the rankings are different. The top 7 most 
important decision criteria are in this order: 1) Brand, 2) Model of Handset; 
3) Network Provider; 4) Look and Feel; 5) Features and Services; 6 Operating 
System; and 7) Apps and Content. Lets look how these differ for the less 
affluent part of the planet's population.<br>
<br>
 AMPLIFYING REASON 4 - BRAND 
IS MUDDLED<br>
<br>
 You understand that if Nokia was a rubbish brand in the 
USA, but still ranked 8th most powerful brand globally in 2010. then Nokia had 
to be far better than ranked 8th outside of the USA, after all the USA is by 
far the biggest economy on the planet. And it was. Nokia was not only the best 
phone brand essentially in every country outside of the USA, Canada (and South 
Korea and Japan); but it was literally the most valued brand: period. In many 
countries from India to Nigeria. The most trusted, most desired, most valued 
and loved brand. And that was of course also damaged massively by the Elop 
Effect as in the above. But some evidence. In India for example Nokia was 
toppled in 2011 from being the topmost brand.<br>
<br>
 In the 'West' we have 
PCs at work and home. We know Microsoft well and most of us use Windows based 
PCs. Both Microsoft and Windows are very powerful brands for us. But in the 
Emerging World they do not have PCs in every home or every office. If they do, 
they are often Linux based PCs (or have pirated Microsoft software which may be 
very buggy etc). So while we in the Industrialized World can at least 
theoretically have a good impression about Microsoft and Windows, and it can 
'help' in the branding battles - top priority please remember, then<strong><em>
in the Emerging World countries the Microsoft Brand is no help and easily a 
hindrance.</em></strong><br>
<br>
 But Elop has consistently been making it 
worse. Making Nokia's branding worse. He made a widely criticized decision to 
change Nokia's naming, to go to pure numbering in its names (Not Nokia N9 or E7 
or X7, but just Nokia 500 etc). This was very confusing and he reversed his 
decision two months later and today we have the Lumia series, the Asha series, 
and even individual phone models like the Lumia Ace ie Lumia 900.<br>
<br>
 
Then he decided to kill the Ovi store brand. The Ovi store was nothing, nobody 
and nowhere in the USA and no doubt when Elop flew every week from Finland to 
his other home in Seattle USA, he felt Ovi was a failure. Except that it 
wasn't. The iPhone App Store is the world's bestselling smartphone app store .. 
in those countries where the primary language is English. But all those 
countries combined have a population that covers 7% of the planet's population. 
What about the other 93% of us? The biggest country by population is China. 
Biggest app store in China?<strong>Ovi. </strong>The second biggest country by 
population is India. Biggest app store? Yes,<strong>Ovi</strong>. Third biggest 
population is the USA, but fourth biggest? Indonesia. App Store king?<strong>Ovi
</strong>. Fifth biggest population is Brazil. Store?<strong> Ovi.</strong> 
Then Russia.<strong>Ovi.</strong> Nigeria. Ovi. Pakistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, 
Vietnam, Turkey,<strong>Ovi Ovi Ovi...</strong><br>
<br>
 Nokia's Ovi store 
supports over 50 languages! And obviously, local developers can offer local 
apps in their home languages! And<em><strong>now Elop wants to cause all that 
confusion by discontinuing the Ovi store brand.</strong></em> Why? What 
possible benefit can it deliver, while Nokia's overall apps partnering is in 
turmoil with Symbian and MeeGo and Maemo and Windows Phone and S40 and Meltemi 
and whatnot. And its not just that, very big global partners have been 
cross-promoting the Ovi store. CNN for example was promoting its Symbian 
smartphone app worldwide on countless daily ads on all CNN channels. The value 
of just that advertising runs in the millions except that Nokia got it for 
free. And what did CNN still promote in December of 2011 - half a year after 
the end of the Ovi brand - yes CNN's smartphone app was available on the Ovi 
Store. No wonder Nokia's brand is being flushed down the toilet. The CEO is 
actively assassinating the brand in every way he can.<br>
<br>
 AMPLIFYING 
REASON 7 - FAILING MODEL OF HANDSET<br>
<br>
 In the Emerging World the 
smartphone situation is dramatically different from that of the wealthy 
Industrialized World. For us in the Industrialized World countries, it is no 
hardship to pay 600 dollars for a premium smartphone like the iPhone or Samsung 
Galaxy or Blackberry Bold or Sony Xperia or Nokia Lumia 800. But in the 
Emerging World where it is very common to have a daily wage of 2 dollars (thats 
before taxes) a 600 dollar superphone is totally beyond reach. As implausible 
as thinking of buying a corporate jet or a superyacht. They dream of buying a 
bicycle to improve their lifestyle. They do have mobile phones but ones that 
cost under 50 dollars, often as cheap as 20 dollars new.<br>
<br>
 (For US 
readers, remember, a 'free' iPhone 3GS on 2 year contract is not a free phone. 
I am always talking of real prices, not the bogus prices of bundled contracts 
with handset subsidies. The African farmer who earns 2 dollars per day, can 
neither afford to buy the iPhone at 600 dollars without contract, nor to sign 
up for a 2 year contract of 50 dollars per month to get a 'free' iPhone on 
handset subsidy).<br>
<br>
 Here we have to go to the phone price pyramid. I 
don't have a current one in the public domain but in 2009 Morgan Stanley 
published their price pyramid for mobile phones worldwide. Morgan Stanley found 
2% of the phones sold to be premium smartphones; 11% to be other smartphones 
and the remaining 87% to be 'featurephones' ie non-smartphones or 'dumbphones'. 
These cheap phones in 2009 had an average price of 100 dollars (that has come 
down since then). In 2009 about 13% of new phones sold were indeed smartphones. 
Now about 29% of all mobile phones sold worldwide were smartphones.<br>
<br>
 
The planet did not suddenly have a huge rise in its wealth in the past two 
years (arguably, we've suffered globally with the economic crash). The poorer 
people didn't suddenly all - billions of them - receive massive pay rises. But 
the total smartphone proportion of all phones sold more than doubled in the 
past two years. The only way that is possible, is if smartphones have become 
less expensive at the low end of the price point. The 100 dollar smartphone 
(remember, this is without contract! Without handset subsidies, a 100 dollar 
smartphone).<br>
<br>
 And we have them! Nokia shipped sub-100 dollar 
smartphones from 2009 as did Samsung. We are now fast approaching the 50 dollar 
smartphone led by ultra-low-cost phone makers who specialize in the Emerging 
World markets, from global giants like ZTE and Huawei, to regional players like 
MiFone of Africa and Micromax of India etc.<br>
<br>
 Nokia was perfectly 
poised to fight for this low-cost price segment with Symbian, because Symbian 
was designed to work on very modest technological requirements and often these 
ultra-low cost smartphones are not touch screen devices. Meanwhile Microsoft's 
Windows Phone was designed to work on very high spec components - in fact, 
Windows Phone does not even work on Nokia's standard chip supplier equipment 
like Texas Instruments. And Nokia<em><strong> owned the low-cost smartphone 
space</strong></em>. Canalys statistics tell us that in China in 2010 in Q2 the 
market share for Nokia (obviously running Symbian) was.. get this.. 77% !!! The 
second biggest smartphone maker brand in China was Motorola and Nokia was .. 16 
times bigger than its nearest rival. This, in the country that was about to 
become the world's biggest smartphone market.<br>
<br>
 Similar stats from 
market after market after market. Over 70% of smartphones in India over 80% 
over the whole continent of Africa in new smartphone sales in 2010 were Nokia 
branded. Nokia had very accurately foreseen the future markets as they emerged, 
and provided suitable, low-cost smartphones for those markets and utterly 
dominated the Emerging World. And how? By offering a wide range of smartphone 
models. Now the Lumia 800 and 710 are far too expensive for this market. 
(again, US readers, don't be fooled about T-Mobile contract price of 50 dollars 
for Lumia 710, it costs many times more without the subsidy).<br>
<br>
 Lumia 
800 (And 900) is utterly beyond the market price except for the rich elites, 
who will rather buy iPhones, Blackberries etc. The Lumia 710 is yes, cheaper 
than the 800 but its still far too expensive to become any kind of mass market 
success (its price without subsidy is about 350 - 400 dollars). But in the 
Emerging World countries, the price differential between models is far more 
value-driven. There are almost no subsidies, so you pay exact real retail 
price. One phone model costs 479 dollars, the next 529 dollars, another 499 
dollars etc. The differences are nuances.<br>
<br>
 And the buyer has worked 
far more for that dollar than we have had to for our dollar. The customer is 
far FAR more value-aware. The customer knows FAR more accurately what is true 
value. So the feature list is scrutinized far more thoroughly. All aspects are 
tried and tested before purchase. The advice and guidance of peers and friends 
is seeked even more than we might do. Remember, these customers do not have an 
internet to go do price-shopping. They do not read tech magazines with product 
reviews and contrasts and recommendations.<br>
<br>
 With Symbian at low-cost 
smatphones, Nokia had conquerred the world. If Elop could have left Symbian 
alone, he would be now reaping the benefits of all the hard work Nokia did over 
the years. Except he didn't. The Elop Effect collapsed the Nokia smartphone 
sales globally, not only in the Affluent countries but also in the Emerging 
World countries. So look at China. Analysys gave the Q2 market shares for China 
in 2011 and Nokia had crashed in one year to.. 22% with Samsung and Motorola 
nipping at Nokia's heels. Now in October 2011, Morgan Stanley reported that 
Chinese consumers plan to buy their next smartphone preference for Nokia had 
fallen further to 18%.<br>
<br>
 What Nokia would have desperately needed out 
of early Lumia was low-cost smartphones now, to try to hold onto that market 
share. It is being now burned forever. And the Microsoft Windows Phone cavalry 
will not arrive in time to save Nokia. The current Windows Phone edition does 
not support low-cost smarphones. Because of that, Nokia can't even start to 
ship low-cost smartphones until the second half of this year at the earliest 
(if Microsoft manages to deliver on time). So the handset portfolio problem is 
far bigger here in the low end of the smartphones for the Emerging World 
markets.<br>
<br>
 REASON 12 - HOSTILE CARRIER RELATIONS WITH NOKIA<br>
<br>
 
The third biggest factor for smartphone buyers in the Emerging World, far ahead 
of apps or the OS, is the network provider ie the carrier ie mobile operator. 
The issues range from network coverage to service reliability to network 
technology to service offering and pricing etc.<br>
<br>
 Nokia had THE BEST 
carrier relationships in the world. Nokia phones are sold on more networks than 
any other phone brand and Nokia has special partnership relationships with many 
carriers, ranging from the world's largest carrier/operator China Mobile to the 
world's most advanced and demanding carrier/operator NTT DoCoMo of Japan (the 
carrier who launched the world's first cellular telecoms mobile business ie the 
company that started this industry).<br>
<br>
 I am not suggesting that all 
Nokia carrier relationships were in good condition. The USA relationships were 
particularly damaged. But compared to any other handset maker, Motorola, 
Samsung, LG, Apple, RIM, HTC, whoever, Nokia had the best,<strong>THE BEST 
</strong>carrier relationships worldwide. That is why even when Nokia had 
problems like the failed flagship smartphone N97, Nokia overall global sales 
did not suffer severely. Compare to Motorola which after the Razr launched the 
Rokr and today Motorola is no more, as the bankrupted and split-up handset 
maker it was bought by Google.<br>
<br>
 Nokia cultivated the partnership model 
with its app store, Ovi, and its content and its networked services such as 
maps, advertising, mobile payments etc. Nokia had secured 'carrier billing' 
relationships with over 100 carriers worldwide for Ovi (no other rival app 
store had even one quarter that level - carrier billing means one-click 
payments that get charged directly off your phone bill or prepaid account. No 
credit cards etc needed). With the language support, the ecosystems nationally 
around the carriers and Nokia grew meaningful in many cases. Now last year in 
February that all was suddenly sunk, with the Elop Effect.<br>
<br>
 I am not 
suggesting the carriers/operators loved Nokia - Nokia was too big and powerful 
to be loved. But Nokia was seen as a mostly gentle giant, and one that mostly 
did not do harm to the ecosystem. And over time Nokia management earned a 
reputation that you could count on Nokia's word.That all died with the Elop 
Effect.<br>
<br>
 From February 2011, the global carrier community revolted 
against Nokia and Elop. Nokia was placed on a sales boycott. This has been 
reported only in anecdotal evidence and mostly in countries of the 
Industrialized World, but Nokia itself admitted in the Quarterly results that 
its carriers and distribution channel had reduced inventory suddenly and to an 
unanticipatedly large degree. Evidence? I can't 'prove' prove it to you, but it 
is very widely accepted by experts in the industry, that Nokia's resale channel 
froze in February and Nokia products were removed from displays etc. This 
phenomenon continues and reports trickle in from many countries that Nokia 
smartphones are conspicuous in their absense from store shelves and 
inventories. Obviously the global utter collapse of Nokia smartphone sales is 
partially a symptom of this problem (and other problems).<br>
<br>
 REASON 13 - 
HOSTILE CARRIER RELATIONS WITH MICROSOFT<br>
<br>
 Nokia was known to be 
friendly to carriers if bureaucratic and uncompromising. If that feeling turned 
to hostility, there is good chance it can be reversed. But Microsoft was known 
as the Evil Empire long before they announced the partnership with Nokia. 
Forget about Microsoft's bullying of its developers and partners and rivals, 
and the prolonged feuds with the regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.<em>
<strong>Just in wireless, Microsoft is the mobile death wish</strong></em>. 
Their very first strategic partner and launch customer for Microsoft's first 
smartphones, UK based Sendo was driven to bankruptcy after lengthy court cases 
with the Evil Empire. Motorola went from profitable to loss-making in its 
strategic partnership with Microsoft smartphones. Motorola was so disgusted it 
announced it would discontinue smartphones on Microsoft platforms which gained 
it a lawsuit to boot. LG's strategic partership with Microsoft bled the company 
profits into losses and LG ran to Android. HTC, Microsofts' longest-serving 
smartphone partner was so upset with Microsoft, it refused to support the final 
version of Windows Mobile and now strongly prioritizes Android. If you don't 
know the history of how devastating Microsoft has been to its 'strategic 
partners' in mobile, like the vampire, its bled them dry. ReadHorace Dediu's 
review of In Memoriam: Microsoft's previous strategic partners.<br>
<br>
 
Microsoft is like the cheap prostitute. Not only has Microsoft been sleeping 
with everybody, but Microsoft then awards its 'strategic partners' with a 
sexually transmitted incurable disease as a parting gift.<br>
<br>
 While mass 
market consumers are usually blissfully ignorant of the backstabbing in the 
corporate world of partnerships, the carriers/operators are not. They pay very 
close attention to every player in the market. The carriers/operators know they 
need the handsets, and smarpthones need operating systems to run. They are very 
aware who is who and who plays naughty and who plays nice. No wonder that 'do 
no evil' Google is getting global support everywhere. I do not have to go into 
the specifics of what all Microsoft has been doing in the past to anger the 
carrier community, as it is widely acknowledged that Microsoft's carrier 
relations were 'strained' or 'challenged'. Even Microsoft executives 
acknowledge this as a fact.<br>
<br>
 Then came Skype. I have written another 
long blog explaining why Skype is the ultimate red flag to carriers/operators. 
You can believe me, or not. That doesn't matter, we now have an ex Microsoft 
executive, no: ex Windows Phone General Manager at Microsoft, Charlie Kindel, 
who acknowledges that Microsoft had further angered the carriers in 2011. This 
is how he phrased it &quot;Windows Phone raised its middle finger at the 
carriers&quot; and to make matters worse, even after that, currently 
&quot;Windows Phone requires Microsoft to push hard on the carriers&quot; And 
the carriers do not like this at all. Kindel said carriers are reluctant. He 
said because carriers have explicitly decided to support Android rather than 
Windows Phone - &quot;that is why Windows Phone has not sold as well&quot;.<br>

<br> Whatever you thought of Microsoft success or failure in the past in mobile,
<em><strong>the ex General Manager of Windows Phone tells us that Microsoft had 
indeed had a bad relationship with carriers</strong></em>, Microsoft's attitude 
to carriers had already been one of arrogance and abuse; and that carriers 
hated it;<em><strong>and that since then Microsoft had been making matters worse
</strong></em>- and the resulting <em><strong>penalty from carriers was to push 
sales away form Microsoft to Android</strong></em>. I say boycott, you say 
tomato. Regardless, it is patently obvious that<em><strong>Microsoft 
relationships with carriers were bad before and are getting worse with Windows 
Phone</strong></em>. This now is again worsened as we hear for example from 
Europe that Nokia was bullying carriers about commitments to sell Lumia in Q4 
etc.<br>
<br>
 Whereas in the Emerging World, for smartphone purchases, 
consumers will look at the operator/carrier as the third most important issue - 
where Nokia's reputation has suffered with Elop and Lumia; and its partnering 
with Microsoft has only made matters worse. This means Lumia is worse off than 
Nokia was before the Elop Effect. Worse off. Lumia is in trouble.<br>
<br>
 
AMPLIFYING REASON 3 - LOOK AND FEEL<br>
<br>
 Remember in the Emerging World 
Nokia is the gold standard for consumers of mobile phones. They worship Nokias. 
Even the superphones are featured in the stores even as few customers ever can 
afford them. Proud owners walk with four year old models if they were top 
models way back when and so forth. In countries where the average person has no 
hope of ever owning a car, the mobile phone is the nearest thing to a true 
status symbol. Nokia has far higher assigned esteem than just a phone or gadget.
<br> <br>
 So the customers know Nokia models and their specs. And they truly 
appreciate some minor details. That FM radio that you laughed at in the 
Features section many thousand words ago in this story? In Africa, literally, 
for about half of the population, the first radio they ever personally owned, 
is the one that comes on the Nokia phone. Yes, they don't have TV sets. They 
are so poor they don't even own a radio receiver. Not until the first radio in 
the mobile phone.<br>
<br>
 The hideously stripped nature of the feature set of 
the Lumia line is screaming for rejection. Look at electricity. We take 
electricity for granted. In countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh the 
electrical grid is shut off several times.. per day .. to conserve energy. How 
do you live in that kind of world? The replacable battery is far more 
necessary. And power grid? In India and much of Africa the access to 
electricity is so rare, that people often send the spare batteries to nearby 
towns or villages to be recharged (while using the other spare battery to power 
the phone). Bluetooth file transfers, microSD cards, these are absolute 
must-haves where there will be no practical use or indeed network connectivity 
to use Microsoft's SkyDrive. Nokia knows all this. The sensible smartphone 
designed for emerging world markets as a low-cost smartphone will have dual SIM 
slots, will have family ringing and family phonebooks (allowing the sharing of 
one phone with several family members) and will include the torch/flashlight 
etc where the village has no street lights at night etc.<br>
<br>
 The Lumia 
including Lumia 710 was designed by affluent American college kids. They have 
zero concept of what a farmer in Nigeria needs or a lumberjack in Brazil or a 
fisherman in the Philippines. But Nokia's 'real' designers know. The past Nokia 
phones, dumbphones and smartphones have dominated the Emerging World. But this 
Lumia series including its 'cheap' version Lumia 710 is a slap in the face of 
Emerging World markets. And the series will flop utterly, comprehensively.<br>

<br> I COULD GO ON<br>
<br>
 Yes, I could. There is NOTHING in the Lumia 800 or 
Lumia 710 today, or in the Lumia 900 late in the spring, that is better than 
what Nokia had in the past, or what rivals offer today.<em><strong>Whatever you 
think of Nokia's success in the past, whether you applaud it or are aghast, the 
performance of Lumia will be worse</strong></em>. I have given you only 13 
reasons why Lumia will fail. These 13 reasons are not my opinions of what I 
think should be the cause or effect for smartphone market succes. I have given 
you evidence and facts and stats and end-user surveys, showing what smartphone 
users do, and what smartphone users want, and what other factors influence the 
purchase decision ie the carrier relationshiops the corporate purchase 
departments.<br>
<br>
 If you think another reason somehow 'trumps' these 13 
problems, I suggest you not only decide it is so, because you think that makes 
sense. If it is indeed true, you should be able to find experts saying so. If 
you do find experts claiming some benefits for Lumia, then compare those to 
this list of 13 and see if the evidence suggests one is more relevant than 
another.<br>
<br>
 I SAID NOTHING OF BUILD QUALITY<br>
<br>
 The above is all 
sales related matters. Marketing, branding, design, price, distribution. They 
are utterly dooming Lumia. I didn't talk about the reality of the device as it 
is manufactured, whether design flaws or component problems or build quality 
etc.<br>
<br>
 This is a whole new can of worms. Imagine if if I sold you a 
Ferrari. A brand new Ferrari. And rather than it costing say 200,000 dollars, I 
charge you 150,000 dollars for the brand new Ferrari. Bright Ferrari red, the 
prancing horse logo and all. You get full registration and all details. A 
genuine Ferrari 2 seater sportscar. Luxury. Sportscar. And you are not quite 
familiar with all Ferrari models, so you then talk with your friend and then 
you go to the internet to see the actual details about this particular Ferrari 
model.<br>
<br>
 What if you find out that your 'genuine' Ferrari was not 
actually manufactured in a Ferrari factory in Maranello Italy. It actually came 
from India, from the Tata motors factory (the company that makes the cheapest 
car in the world). Well, that is not really the end of the world, as long as it 
does have real Ferrari components, except that when you look at the engine, you 
find it came not from Ferrari's engine factory. The engine your Tata sportscar 
has, came from Proton the cheap car maker in Malaysia. But you do love the look 
and feel of the Ferrari and its bright red Ferrari color, until you drive next 
to another red Ferrari, and obseve that your red is not the same red. So you 
dig more and you find out, that this car wasn't painted by Ferrari in its 
colors, it was painted by Kia the cheap car maker of South Korea. And you 
think, ok, but it does drive well, and at least it was designed by the iconic 
sportscar superstar designers from Italy. And then you find out, the car was 
designed by the tractor factory designers from Zetor in Russia. The only thing 
genuine Ferrari is the badge, which they bolted onto this fake Ferrari, and 
even that was not put on in Italy. No part of the car has ever seen the country 
of Forza Ferrari! Would you feel betrayed?<br>
<br>
 That is the Lumia. <em>
<strong>No aspect of it is genuine Nokia</strong></em>. It was not designed by 
Nokia's top designers from Finland. It was not manufactured in Nokia's world's 
most efficient and competent handset manufacturing factories. And it isn't even 
powered by Nokia components like the CPU (the engine). And we know the 
decorations are not genuine Nokia - the operating system and apps (the paint 
job). Rather than Nokia's own-designed mobile-optimised and smart OS platforms, 
Symbian and MeeGo, this fraudster uses an OS that was never designed to any 
degree by any Nokia programmers. And the production.. Get this. Nokia factories 
are the world's most modern and efficient, including the world's largest 
handset plant in China. They are now idling because Nokia sales have crashed. 
What does Elop do? He actually hired an outside company, Compal of Taiwan, to 
manufacture the Lumia smartphones! That is not a Nokia. Nothing about it is a 
Nokia, except that the CEO has the nerve to stick a Nokia badge on the phone 
and claim it is a genuine Nokia.<br>
<br>
 Let me make an observation here. 
Stephen Elop is an excellent communicator but he seems to be a systematic liar. 
Just about everything he does, and everything he says, turns out to be untrue, 
often the opposite seems to come true. I am thinking of former Vice President 
Dick Cheney and 'we know where the weapons of mass destruction are'. He looked 
you in the eye and lied, deliberately. That to me, is what Elop seems to be. 
None of his words have any relationship with reality or the truth. So lets 
continue..<br>
<br>
 No matter what any expert may have said about how obsolete 
Symbian was or how horrible Ovi store was or how bad the software was, the one 
thing everybody agrees about Nokia, its build quality has always - always - 
been the best in the world. No Antennagates at Nokia. No exploding batteries at 
Nokia. No cracked screens at Nokia. There was the famous dog who ate the Nokia 
phone. It went through the dog, and the next day, in the dog poo, the Nokia 
phone was there, and it worked. They are bulletproof.<br>
<br>
 Is that the 
same for a contract manufacturer with near slave labor in Taiwan who make 
phones and gadgets for dozens of companies? No. It cannot be. And the first 
evidence is already out. I mentioned the SMS crippling text.<em><strong>There 
is a second technical manufacturing problem already admitted by Nokia</strong>
</em>. The Lumia battery is failing. Some batteries draw down too fast, others 
don't recharge properly and sometimes the problem blocks the whole battery 
operation. This is the build quality you get when you outsource your factory. 
The last vestige of Nokia strongholds - its superb build quality - is now 
jeopardized and indeed, first evidence of problems already not just reported - 
but acknowledged by Microsoft and Nokia! The Lumia is a failure and it will get 
worse.<br>
<br>
 FORBES REASONS ARE QUITE SILLY, ACTUALLY<br>
<br>
 So lets go 
to the Forbes article then. The Forbes article starts off saying Windows Phone 
has a totally unique User Interface. That may be true. But is it truly more 
important, that the UI is 'unique' - something no buyer asked for - or whether 
the operating system itself if useful, or the app store has tons of apps, or 
the camera is easy to use; etc. I am not saying it doesn't matter at all. But I 
don't see someone coming to the store, and buying the lousy phone with the 
unique interface rather than the good phone with the familiar interface.<br>

<br> So let me quickly comment on the other five reasons. Forbes said Windows 
Phone would have less patent wars. That may be good for Microsoft (which seems 
not to care in the least about suing everyone so it might even be seen as a 
drawback at Redmond). But this is utterly irrelevant to Nokia. Nokia has the 
biggest patent portfolio of any handset maker in mobile and has invented the 
second most aspects to mobile behind only NTT DoCoMo. Look at the Apple 
lawsuit. Apple is suing everybody and winning. Apple surrendered to Nokia and 
now pays Nokia not just for every iPhone made, but Apple also paid a lump sum 
to compensate Nokia for the patent infringements of early iPhones. Nokia didn't 
need to pay one penny to Apple. No, Nokia doesn't need patent protection, and 
this wont' matter one iota in Lumia's success or failure.<br>
<br>
 The third 
point raised by Forbes is that with Windows Phone there will be uniformity 
across devices. So they claim no fragmentation. Obviously that is impossible, 
even with the iPhone there is fragmentation (Retina Display for example so the 
screen resolutions are different in the 3 series and 4 series of iPhones). But 
yes, I'll accept this is a fair argument. Symbian is plagued with fragmentation 
(although it was getting less so) and Android is seeing more and more of it.<br>
<br> So? Do you go asking your handset dealer about fragmentation? I think this 
phone has too much fragmentation, I'd like another phone with a bit less 
fragmentation? No. This issue is a total non-issue - for end-user consumers 
when buying the smartphone. Yes, some geek like you and me may know of it, but 
even for us, its very VERY low in the order of what we want. Fragmentation is 
relevant to application developers and other partners, not to end-users. If the 
market is big, and there is money to be made, then application developers will 
cope with the fragmentation. They don't like it, but they will do it, if there 
is money. If the ecosystem is tiny, no matter how uniform it might be, if the 
market size is too small, they won't care. Market size totally trumps 
fragmentation.</p> 
<p><br>
 Then Forbes says that Zune is a reason why Windows Phone will 
succeed. Maybe so. But first, remember that 'services' (like Zune) came in at 
7th most relevant point when deciding, in the Industrialized World and 5th in 
the Emerging World. And Zune is only one in a series of services. Will it 
matter, of course it will. Will it decide some sales, maybe. Will it change the 
world for Lumia, of course not. Because most of all, there is Nokia Music! 
Nokia's OWN music service! Nokia has been selling 'Comes With Music' handsets 
for years. Zune might - might - duplicate the modest success of Nokia Music in 
the best case. More likely, today consumers have so many ways to get music by 
sideloading and on free music services, that it won't matter one iota.<br>
<br>

 Lastly Forbes mentions Xbox Live support. Note, this doesn't exist and no word 
has been given that it will be arriving to Windows Phone and/or Lumia. So this 
is utter speculation of what MIGHT help the smartphone. Sure, like Madonna said 
to Wayne and Garth, And monkeys might fly out of my butt. Microsoft MAY do this 
some day. After that all games need to be repurposed to the Windows Phone 
format - thats no small feat - and the handsets need the gaming accelerators 
etc for the hardware, etc. This is at best a long-term gain. Except that I have 
bad news for you. Nokia HAS a VAST library of videogames already formated for 
the small screen. Nokia has its own gaming engine with graphics accelerators 
and all. Its called N-Gage. The first Nokia flagship smartphone to include the 
N-Gage gaming engine was the N82. And you know what. It did not set the world 
on fire, the gaming side. Yes, we all play Angry Birds but a vast gaming 
catalog of 'pure' platform games, rather than custom 'casual' mobile games? I 
don't see Xbox gaming to be a 'game changer' haha. But yes, even if you like 
this, this idea is pure speculation and cannot be implemented this year. So its 
pretty phoney by Forbes to add this as a reason why Windows Phone will 'make a 
big splash' in the smartphones market this year.<br>
<br>
 SO THE VERDICT</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have given you my 13 reasons why Lumia is currently failing and will 
continue to fail. I based them not on my personal desires and preferences of 
what I like in my phones, I based it on the facts and stats of what real 
consumers do and want. I also refuted each of the 5 reasons Forbes felt that 
Windows Phone would win. What is the truth?<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>We will know in a few days when Nokia reports its Q4 results. Last year at 
this time, for Q4, Nokia introduced a new operating system version, Symbian S^3 
led by the new flagship smartphone N8. This was not a make-or-break critical 
product launch. It was just routine, supported with no particular marketing 
effort. The smartphones were competing with many other Nokia smartphones 
already in the stores, so they faced competition from Nokia's own product line. 
They sold 4 million units. That was a year ago. Since then the global 
smartphone market has grown by 60%. So just to compare apples to apples, the 
new operating system launch led by the new flagship phone, Lumia 800, would 
need to sell 6.4 million copies in the past Q4, only to match what Nokia did a 
year ago.<br>
<br>
 And notice. All factors were totally in the control of 
Elop. He could choose which type of models Nokia would create - as these are 
truly new-from-the-ground-up smartphones, as they do not even use standard 
Nokia components. He could decide their specifications, their intended target 
markets and end-users. He could decide which countries and which carriers would 
be offered the Lumia. He could decide how to price them and support the launch 
with marketing. Elop could decide how and where to introduce the actual models 
to the public, how near or far from the commercial launch date. He could decide 
when to announce the Microsoft partnership. Nothing was forced upon him. This 
is totally Elop's choice. The Nokia share price was not falling in February - 
the stock market liked Elop's first five months of Nokia leadership so much, 
that the share price had climbed 11% - a very strong growth in a five month 
period for the new CEO, when the previous three years had seen a 50% drop in 
Nokia share price.<br>
<br>
 And Elop could plan carefully, organize everything 
and make sure the most important product launch in Nokia's history would be a 
total success. Elop had carte blanche to overspend on the launch marketing 
activities as much as he wanted, and obviously no other CEO in any other 
situation would have approved as extravagant marketing budgets for just any 
year's 'regular' flagship model launch.<br>
<br>
 If thats not enough for you, 
there is the Microsoft marketing machine. Microsoft committed 'billions' of 
marketing support to Nokia Lumia. So this is by every measure the single 
biggest product launch in the history of mobile phones. Nokia could throw all 
at it, and Microsoft would essentially then double that still.<br>
<br>
<em>
<strong>You would have to be a colossal idiot to mess this launch up</strong>
</em>. So, last year with only normal launch, with a tight schedule which could 
not be changed (the N8 and S^3 were delayed to an embarrassing degree), with 
only modest marketing budget (Nokia had just recovered from a quarterly loss) 
the N8 and Symbian S^3 sold 4 million copies. Adjusted for growth, this time 
that would be 6.4 million units. If Elop is only an average manager, he will 
achieve 6.4 million in his sleep. This time there is huge pent-up demand for 
Nokia phones and almost no rival Nokia handsets to steal any Lumia sales.<br>

<br> With these matters utterly in his control the CEO can easily deliver that. 
Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, the disgraced previous CEO could have easily delivered 
6.4 million sales of Nokia's newest flagship and its OS if given those 
parameters. Anssi Vanjoki even if asleep, even if simultaneously having 
nightmares, could still outperform the 6.4 million under those conditions. So 
we will see the mettle of Stephen Elop, is he competent to run Nokia.<br>
<br>
 
And all the evidence says Nokia Lumia sales in Q4 were a total disaster. 
Unmitigated utter colossal catastrophy. In Britain Lumia didnt make it into the 
Top 10 bestselling smarpthones even for the December month. In Germany the same 
story, not even the Top 10, not even for the December month. Customer surveys 
suggested only 2% of customers in the launch countries even considered a Lumia. 
The measured sales are worse than that. Every industry analyst with short term 
quarterly forecasts has either reduced their target or held steady. Not one, 
not a one analyst has increased their forecast. This while the industry reports 
massive jump in Q4 sales by rivals like Samsung and Apple.<br>
<br>
 But the 
spin doctors are at it. Taking a book from Donald Rumsfeld they are trying to 
convince investors that Lumias will be greeted as liberators. They try to erase 
the known unknowns. Look what is happening. Nokia unattributed executive said 
Lumia sales were &quot;getting good traction&quot; and &quot;we are pleased 
with the early results&quot;. But no named source and no numbers! One Nokia 
executive claimed the youth were growing tired of the iPhone. This against the 
reported evidence that the iPhone is breaking all of its sales record and on 
every national chart for which I have seen statistics, the iPhone 4S sits as 
the bestselling phone for Q4.<br>
<br>
 What is even more insidious and will 
damage Nokia's tattered reputation considerably, is the revellation that Nokia 
and Microsoft executives have been going to blogsites to argue with reviews if 
they were negative about Lumia. The employees did this with aliases, but were 
revealed from the website addresses they used. They came from Nokia and 
Microsoft offices. TheGuardian reported on this for example. The Blogosphere is 
very upset with Nokia - perhaps less so with Microsoft as it seems to be par 
for the course. We now apparently have the Evil Empire and its Evil Twin.<br>

<br> FARCE OF THE THIRD ECOSYSTEM<br>
<br>
 It is hard to avoid articles that 
talk about Microsoft and Nokia, that do not mention the promised nirvana of the 
'Third Ecosystem'. Elop and Ballmer talk about it at every opporunity. And they 
are very happy to quote reputable analyst houses who promised Windows Phone 
with Nokia will reach 20% market share or better in smartphones.<br>
<br>
 
There are literally thousands of news stories parroting that 20% number and the 
Third Ecosystem baloney. And when you think about it, if Google's Android has 
about 45% and Apple's iPhone between 15% and 20%, then if Nokia and Microsoft 
can get 20% - game on. This is Xbox vs Playstation vs Wii. Then yes, most 
definitely, Microsoft and Nokia are in the game and can certainly be believed, 
that they can win this game.<br>
<br>
 Now the reality. While Nokia and 
Microsoft have been repeating the 20% numbers from those big analyst houses, as 
recently as October of 2011, the reality is, that those numbers are not news in 
October. They were repeating an old story. Not from September. Not from August 
or July or June. Not from May, but from April and March. And here is the 
relevant point - the two major analyst house projections for Microsoft Windows 
Phone with Nokia partnership, were published before Nokia and Microsoft Q1 
financial performance numbers were released.<br>
<br>
 They are based on data 
form Q4 of 2010. The forecast was based on numbers, prior to the Elop Effect. 
So yes, if you take Nokia in December 2010, when Nokia had 29% market share 
with Symbian; and you add Microsoft Windows Phone and Windows Mobile, who had a 
combined market share of 3%, and add those together, you get 32%. From that it 
is a very 'safe' projection - actually quite negative of this alliance, if 
separately they are worth 32% but combined they only do 20% or 22% or something 
like that.<br>
<br>
 Now we know that Stephen Elop destroyed his company in 
February. We know there emerged a sales boycott. We know the market share 
crashed, sales revenues crashed and Nokia profits vanished. Did those analyst 
houses bother to give an updated forecast? No. They have remained silent (in 
shock). They are hoping and praying that nobody ever ever mentions their absurd 
forecasts again.<br>
<br>
 So, earlier this week, we had the very first major 
industry analyst house issue a fresh, post Elop Effect, forecast for Nokia and 
Microsoft Windows Phone. That was Morgan Stanley. They say that Windows Phone 
would reach about 37 million unit sales this year and 64 million in 2013. These 
number have been reported in hundreds of stories and the vast majority of those 
stories cheerfully reported that this was good news.<br>
<br>
 I could tell you 
that a gambler left Las Vegas with 100,000 dollars in his pocket. Is that good 
news? It depends how much he had in his pocket when he arrived in Vegas. In 
this Nokia case, the gambler arrived with a million dollars and only has 
100,000 to show for it. Utter total failure. That is what the 37 million and 64 
million numbers reflect. Not success by any definition. Why?<br>
<br>
 Lets add 
in the Symbian sales and see. Morgan Stanley forecasts that in 2012 Nokia will 
sell 40 million Symbian based smarphones so the total for 2012 for Nokia is 77 
million. In 2013 the projection has 16 million Symbian sales for a total of 80 
million Nokia smartphones. So far so good. Now the cold shower. In 2010 Nokia's 
annual unit sales was 100 million smartphones which gave Nokia a market share 
in smartphones of: 33%. For 2011 it will be around 18% (maybe less). But after 
Nokia jumps into bed with Microsoft in 2012 the market share is not 20%, it 
will be.. 11%.In 2013 Nokia and Microsoft will not magically recover to 20%. 
Morgan Stanley's projection when converged to markets share is.. 8%.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you believe that <em><strong>abandoning 33% market share</strong></em> - 
when your unit sales grew 47% and your revenues grew and your profits grew so 
explosively, for the last quarter Nokia set a record in profit growth of its 
handset unit -<em><strong>and replacing that with 8% market share only 3 years 
later</strong></em>, with no growth but about flat sales, dramatically fallen 
revenues and at best miniscule profits (probably continued losses). Nokia has 
taken its customer base and walked it in front of a firing squad, and shot it 
dead. Destroying 75% of its customer base in three year! This is corporate 
suicide. This is a hara-kiri by the CEO.<br>
<br>
 Please do not say Tomi hates 
Nokia. Those are not my numbers, they are Morgan Stanley's numbers and they are 
the FIRST analyst house to dare to make a projection on the Nokia-Microsoft 
partnership. For what its worth, my gut says they are way too optimistic, the 
evidence suggests it will be worse that this.<br>
<br>
 If Stephen Elop can 
deliver 6.4 million Lumia sales in the past Q4, I am willing to say in public, 
I was wrong, he is competent to manage Nokia and I will accept he's made some 
mistakes that should be forgiven as learning on the job.<br>
<br>
 If Stephen 
Elop can deliver at least the 4 million Lumia sales that Nokia N8 and Symbian 
S^3 did last year - without adding the industry growth, I would conclude that 
Elop is spectacularly incompetent or irresponsible or foolish or rash, but 
perhaps the Board can be forgiven to allow some more time for Elop to try to 
make his strategy work.<br>
<br>
 If Lumia sales are below 4 million, Lumia has 
failed to an unacceptable degree. Elop will have squandered the only chance 
Nokia had had, to try to shift platforms, and blasted what any opportunity may 
have been left for Lumia. If the Lumia sales in Q4 fall under 4 million, the 
signs are undeniable that Lumia's path is a dead end, a cul-de-sac, and the 
sooner Nokia Board sees this, the sooner they must terminate all activites that 
waste resources pursuing that route. It is the proverbial dead horse. And you 
can't ride the dead horse the only thing you can do, is get off the horse and 
find some other way to proceed. If Lumia fails to sell 4 million copies in Q4, 
it will be so comprehensively rejected that Nokia cannot revive it. Then it is 
time to think what to replace it with? Android? MeeGo? Tizen? bada? Blackberry 
OS? Palm/WebOS? (check out where the leading forecasters now estimate Lumia 
sales for Q4. Can you spell 500,000 units?)<br>
<br>
 And obviously my view 
already now as we await the Nokia Q4 numbers for Lumia is, that based on his 
behavior in the past year, Elop has mismanaged his company so totally, that he 
may not be allowed to continue running Nokia. He must be fired. Now!</p>

<h2>January 09, 2012</h2> 
<h3>Who are the 25 Biggest Companies by Mobile Revenues (Ahonen Index) updated 
for 2011 - China Mobile takes top honors</h3> 
<p>Many of the big companies in mobile are not true 'mobile' companies in that 
their history is from other business and often mobile is only a part of their 
total income, like with Google, Apple, Samsung etc. Even of companies that we 
think of as 'mobile' like Nokia, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefonica - they have 
sizeable fixed landline telecoms business. So in February of 2010 I went 
through the trouble of calculating out the pure mobile revenues of all the 
biggest players in mobile andpublished the world's first global listing of the 
25 largest companies, when ranked only by their mobile revenues. I called it 
the Ahonen Index and as far as I've seen, nobody else has published a similar 
list - quite astonishing considering that mobile is the fastest-growing giant 
industry, ever.<br>
<br>
I have wanted to update that list for 2011 and it got 
delayed and delayed. I ended up moving the calcuation point to the Q2 results 
(previous four quarters) so this is now roughly in harmony with the Fortune 
Global 500 issue which is published annually in the summer. And even then, as 
each company involved a lot of digging through their annual reports, it took me 
forever to get it done. But I have finally finished the analysis and am ready 
to publish the 2011 edition of the Ahonen Index: 25 Largest Companies Ranked by 
their Mobile Revenues. I have included their position also from the previous 
list and revenues last time so you see how the growth or decline has been. I am 
also including a Fortune Global 500 rank equivalent for those which would have 
qualified for the Fortune Global 500 based solely on their mobile business and 
what ranking they would have had.<br>

TomiAhonen Almanac 2012, the above table and data may be freely quoted<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Notes:<br>
* indicates imaginary company, based only on mobile 
revenues, with imaginary name for the company<br>
** indicates actual real 
ranking in Fortune Global 500 listing as it is a real company purely in mobile
<br>Note also that the Google company incorporates Motorola Mobility unit 
revenues, but not other Motorola mobile revenues of its networking etc business.
<br><br>
The top 7 companies in mobile are carriers/operators. The top 3 are 
not just from different countries, but based on different continents. And for 
Apple-watchers, not only has 'Apple iPhone' jumped up massively on the list, 
Apple only making smartphones is almost as big as Nokia with smartphones, 
dumbphones and the mobile side of Nokia's networking business, combined.<br>

<br>The above chart is indicative and approximate, rounded off to the nearest 
one billion dollars. The currency fluctuations will impact quite heavily. But 
if you think about the real power and influence, real revenues, employees, etc, 
the above gives a good listing of who are the 25 biggest companies in mobile. 
And while some companies are often in the news, like say Microsoft, a big giant 
in the IT industry, by its mobile revenues, Microsoft isn't even close to 
entering the chart. Similarly HP, which bought Palm (but has since discontinued 
that business) didn't make it to the top 25. The pure smarpthone maker HTC sits 
just out of the chart and is likely to enter it next year. And the one company 
that was replaced from the 2010 list - Russia's biggest mobile operator by 
revenues, MTS, was replaced by another BRIC company biggest operator - Bharti 
Airtel of India. We can expect in the future more and more of the newcomers on 
the list to come from Emerging World markets.<br>
<br>
Regionally, the biggest 
companies of our industry are now split so that 9 come from Europe, 9 also from 
Asia, 6 from North America and 1 from Latin America (but if you want to count 
Mexico as part of the North American continent as separate from the cultural 
division then 7 are from the North American continent).<br>
<br>
By nations of 
the Top 25, 5 of the biggest companies come from the USA, 3 from China, 3 from 
Japan, 2 from South Korea, and 2 from France. And to see how widely dispersed 
this industry is, those top 25 companies are spread across 15 different 
countries.<br>
<br>
About Apple - remember that this is 'mobile' not 'wireless' 
or 'portable' so the iPhone is mobile, but other iOS devices, while they are 
portable like iPad and iPod Touch, they are not mobile devices, their services 
are not mobile, they do not 'ring in your pocket' haha. Similarly for example 
notebook and netbook PCs are not counted for Lenovo or Samsung etc. This is 
strict definition mobile and for Apple that means iPhone and related revenues 
only (but does include iPhone App Store related revenues too)<br>
<br>
You may 
freely quote and repeat the above chart. And one note on profits. NO ! This 
chart took enough time from me. I am not going to try to calculate the 
proportional profits fairly by the about 50 or so companies that are the 
contenders for this top 25 list, and do that also for the profits. If you want 
to, go ahead. I have more important things to do, this blog is NOT a financial 
analysis blog. But as this blog is a mobile industry blog, it does make sense 
to put the big companies in context, especially across the operators, handset 
makers and infrastructure providers. Enjoy.<br>
<br>
PS a plug. The above chart 
is of course one of the over 90 tables and charts that are among the topics 
covered in the TomiAhonen Almanac 2011. The new Almanac 2012 will be released 
in late January or early February. If you buy the 2011 edition now, you will

<h2>September 17, 2010</h2> 
<h3>Welcome Stephen Elop to Best Job in High Tech: New CEO for Nokia</h3> 
<p>(First, its been a hectic week of travel for me, Asia, North America, 
Europe this week, so apologies for this blog being somewhat 'delayed'. I know 
there are many who are interested in my view about Nokia's new CEO. Secondly, I 
promised a review of major smartphone player strategies after the half-year 
results came in. I had already given my view of Apple's strategy in smartphones 
which I wrote during my summer vacation. This new Nokia CEO blog is also going 
to be, by necessity, a review of Nokia's smartphone strategy. Thirdly, please 
allow me some more clumsiness and brevity and even more meandering in my 
writing style this time in this blog article, as I am back from vacation and 
heavily travelling and super-busy, so I wanted to get my thoughts out sooner, 
rather than try to find the time to refine and edit this blog down some more. 
But yes: Long blog warning! And lets delve into the biggest news in mobile of 
last week..)<br>
<br>
ULTIMATE JOB ON THE PLANET<br>
<br>
Imagine, its just 
about the ultimate job? If you were in the IT industry in the early 1990s, and 
you were given the job of CEO of Dell, the world's biggest PC maker - and with 
it came the job of Toshiba, the world's biggest laptop PC maker - where the 
bulk of the revenues were in desktops (Dell) and the future of PCs and more of 
the profits, was in laptops. And as a bonus the job came with being CEO of 
Microsoft, the biggest operating system that ran on all those PCs? Thats a bit 
what the job of CEO of Nokia is today. Except that the job at Nokia in 2010 is 
actually far better, and far more than those three giants even, two decades 
ago! What is best, is that the strategy and business basics at Nokia are 
supremely sound. The new CEO inherits a powerhouse mobile phone maker giant, 
which is on solid foundations, well positioned to reap benefits of the economic 
upturn, and well poised to capture a disproportionately large share of almost 
any conceivable mobile phone industry opportunities that can currently be seen 
on the horizon, including all flavors of smartphone opportunities from 
superphones to app stores.<br>
<br>
Against its real rivals today, Nokia is a 
powerhouse utterly dominating its industry, the true gorilla of the mobile 
world. Yes, its share price has taken a battering recently, but even then - in 
the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, when all rival giant global handset 
makers stumbled, Nokia came through with flying colors, its handset unit 
profitable every single quarter. And most of Nokia's stock price issues are 
related to either communication problems (not fundamental business and 
strategy) and of sectors of the market where Nokia's global success is not in 
any way dependent - but which have recently received significant shareholder 
attention (US market, iPhone, Android). And best of all, Nokia is poised to 
launch a new phone that the early reviews suggest could be a huge hit - any of 
its success over the next 12 months will befall the new CEO.<br>
<br>
WELCOME 
STEPHEN ELOP<br>
<br>
Its the ultimate job for someone hungry to make a name as 
a miracle-maker in high tech. Enter Stephen Elop, from Microsoft, to take the 
reigns as Nokia's new CEO. Welcome Stephen and we wish you the very best of 
luck from here at the Communities Dominate blog - both Alan Moore and I have 
been regular advisors to Nokia in the past, and we know you will be joining a 
great team of professional senior managers who take things strategically and 
with focus, yet constantly observing this industry - mobile - to ensure Nokia 
understands how the landscape is evolving.<br>
<br>
I do not know anything 
about Stephen Elop except that he's a Canadian, he ran Microsoft's Office unit 
and championed cloud computing at Microsoft. He is not just a Microsoft guy, he 
was previously with several other IT companies based in the USA. I honestly am 
not even Googling his background now - I am sitting at a Starbucks in Toronto, 
waiting for my next meeting appointment, and am drafting this article with a 
nice tall cup of cappuchino. So I cannot tell you really anything 'deep' and 
'insightful' about Mr Elop. I can make some very general assumptions but 
honestly I have never met the man, cannot comment on his management style etc.
<br><br>
I do know Nokia pretty well, as a former Nokia executive and having 
followed it actively through my independent consulting career this past decade, 
and regularly discussing Nokia in my books and on this blog (I was just quoted 
about Nokia in the Financial Times this week for example). So I can talk about 
Nokia's strategy and corporate health, in this age of the 'ultimate contest in 
convergence' for the 5 Trillion dollar prize, as I blogged last week.<br>
<br>

NOKIA IS NOT APPLE<br>
<br>
Apple was a struggling PC maker who was finding it 
difficult to sustain the proprietary Macintosh operating system and its 
expensive ecosystem. Apple saw the trend to tiny pocket computers years ago and 
launched the Newton PDA - a gadget far ahead of its time - which was a 
technical masterpiece and a market failure. Apple revived itself in the pocket 
electronics market, by re-inventing the pocket music player market with the 
iPod and revived the whole company, with iPod mania helping sell more Macintosh 
PCs and boosting Apple's margins. But it was not until Apple entered the mobile 
phone market with the iPhone, that its profitability exploded. This was a PC 
maker company with a tiny global market share of about 3%, that made corporate 
losses in the mid 1990s, that found new profits by selling premium luxury 
smartphones.<br>
<br>
Nokia was nothing like that. Nokia was a juggernaut 
profit factory, selling the world's most widely adopted gadget (the mobile 
phone) utterly dominating that space and doing it profitably. For the whole 
past decade, Nokia was every single quarter as big as two of its next largest 
rivals combined, there were several quarters where Nokia made more mobile 
phones than the next 4 biggest handset makers of the world - put together. This 
at a time when mobile phones went from geeky-nerdy tech toys for business 
execs, to must-have communication tools of the whole planet, from the youth to 
the grandparents. Mobile phones sell 1.3 Billion units annually - in any one 
year they sell more mobile phones than the total installed base of personal 
computers on the planet. And for several years now, Nokia has been selling more 
than a million handsets every single day of the year, including weekends and 
holidays. In that decade, Nokia became not just the world's biggest mobile 
phone maker, and the gadget most used on the planet - Nokia became the world's 
most prevalent 'clock' or 'watch', the most used camera brand - even the Nokia 
default ringing tone, known as the 'Nokia Tune' - became the most recognized 
song on the planet, known more than White Christmas or Happy Birthday or any 
song by the Beatles or Elvis or Frank Sinatra or Michael Jackson or Madonna.<br>
<br>There is a Nokia branded phone in the pockets of 1.6 Billion people! Thats 
almost a quarter of the planet! There has never ever EVER been any brand even 
remotely as dominant globally, as Nokia is today. Ford once sold more than half 
of all cars manufactured on the planet yes, but in no country was there a Ford 
in the garages of 25% of the total population. Even at the height of 'Beetle 
mania' meaning the iconic Volkswagen original Beetle, there was not a VW for 
every fourth person on the planet. Timex is the best-selling watch of all time, 
but never was a Timex on the wrists of one out of every four people. Microsoft 
ended up selling over a billion copies of Windows and for long times they had 
over 80% market share in the PC market, but PCs are not that widely spread 
across the planet, so Microsoft never approacted 25% of the planet's 
population. Levi's jeans, Coca Cola drinks, Sony Walkmans, Bic pens, Hoover 
vacuum cleaners, there is no brand ever, that had one quarter of the planet - 
but Nokia is almost at that incredible point, currently used by 23.5% of the 
planet's population (and climbing)<br>
<br>
There are those who say 'But Tomi, 
the iPhone, the app stores, the software/internet side of phones'. Yes. Sure. I 
hear you. Who invented the smartphone? Not Apple. It was Nokia. Remember Nokia 
was not a PC maker like Apple or HP or Lenovo now urgently trying to capture 
the shift from traditional PCs to smartphones. Nokia invented the smartphone 
more than a decade ago. Nokia was the first company to boldly claim that the 
future of phones was smartphones (a view still found controversial to many 
today) and more brazenly, Nokia was the first company to say a smartphone was a 
computer (something ridiculed by the 'real' PC makers at the time, and only 
very recently the PC makers - all 6 of the 6 biggest PC makers in fact - have 
all found it to be true, that a modern smartphone is indeed a 'real' computer, 
only a tiny and pocket-sized one).<br>
<br>
What happened when giant mobile 
phones makers Motorola, SonyEricsson, Samsung and LG tried to shift their 
'dumbphone' user base to smartphones in the past decade? They lost customers in 
that shift! The market shares of those other 'big 5 handset makers' in 
smartphones was almost every quarter worse, than their share in dumphones. 
Motorola was so bad at it, that for about two years, for every one customer 
they convinced to 'upgrade' to a smartphone, they lost literally nine other 
previous Motorola customers of dumbphones to either other branded dumbphones, 
or the new pure smartphone makers like Apple, RIM and HTC.<br>
<br>
That was 
the norm for dumbphone makers. You lost customers trying to shift them from 
dumbphones to smartphones. The norm. To all except Nokia. Nokia market share in 
smartphones has year after year, quarter after quarter, been better than its 
market share in dumbphones. And this amazing transition they have done - 
consistently - while making the best profits of any big phone maker. That is 
the ultimate perfection in 'executing a smartphone strategy'<br>
<br>
Those who 
marvel at Apple's iPhone or Google Android phones today, seem to forget that 
Nokia in its smartphones is not just bigger than all iPhones and all Android 
phones put together - in smartphones this past quarter, Nokia was almost as big 
as its biggest rivals numbers 2, 3 and 4 put together! Thats dominance. And 
again, doing it profitably.<br>
<br>
Even better than that, Nokia's operating 
system for smartphones, Symbian, is so huge, it powers half of all smartphones 
in use on the planet. Even in the big growth stages of the Android now, Symbian 
has lost only a little, still selling more than 4 out of every 10 new 
smartphones this year - where Microsoft's Windows Mobile and Palm have all but 
disappeared, and Apple's iPhone took big losses the past few quarters. Even 
Blackberry has been seeing declines in market share. Yes, Symbian too has lost 
market share, but very little. Android has been killing Microsoft and Palm, and 
damaging Apple - while Symbian (and Blackberry) has been barely touched.<br>

<br>And yes, Symbian is an open source OS (something Apple and RIM and 
Microsoft are not), it is supported by 4 of the world's 10 largest mobile phone 
handset makers (Apple and RIM are not used by any other makers) and most 
tellingly of all - in the world's most advanced mobile phone market - Japan - 
Symbian powers half of all smartphones sold there (it is the OS used by NTT 
DoCoMo for almost all of its smartphones).<br>
<br>
But Nokia is not Apple. 
Apple can focus exclusively on its super-premium luxury smartphone, the iPhone, 
releasing only one new model per year, putting all its effort to create genuine 
most-desirable masterpieces, much like a Ferrari or Porsche in cars. That means 
Apple is consigned to being a tiny nicheplayer which has a global market share 
of 2% of all phones sold (14% of all smartphones). Apple does it thumbing its 
nose at industry standards and quarrels with major players like its 
long-standing feud with Adobe Flash. That is a way to produce exceptional 
devices and services - for the luxury crowd, ie for a tight niche market - but 
it is not the way to win the world. You cannot win the world that way.<br>
<br>

Nokia is more like Toyota or GM, where Apple is more like Ferrari or Porsche. 
And recently the Nokia shareholders have lost faith in Nokia, comparing Nokia's 
flagship model only, rather unfairly, to the Apple iPhone, and then concluding 
that Nokia has somehow 'lost it'. In reality, the top of the market is not the 
growth opportunity in smarpthones - all major analysts say, time and again, 
that the growth opportunity in smartphones is in the bottom of the price range, 
as smartphones go mainstream to the mass market consumers.<br>
<br>
Who 
invented the cheap consumer smartphone? Not Apple. It was Nokia again. Nokia 
already sells basic non-touch screen smartphones at 100 dollars (price without 
subsidy, ie without contract, where the iPhone without contract costs 600 
dollars) and is pushing the price point of cheapest touch screen smartphones to 
that level too - already offering its cheapest touch screen smartphone at 
nearly 100 Euros. No matter what the Apple loyalists think of the iPhone, it 
will never be a mass market phone. Apple is a classic premium luxury niche 
maker, who can hope to have 3% of the market - like it has with the Macintosh 
PC, after 26 years of fighting those battles with its 'revolutionary' PC.<br>

<br>WHAT IS NOKIA?<br>
<br>
Nokia is the world's most used technology brand 
(And most used brand, period). It is the world's most popular smartphone too. 
But the vast majority of Nokia's business still today, is in 'dumbphones' ie 
the basic phones and the featurephones like say a cameraphone or a musicphone. 
And yes, a fraction of Nokia's total phone output is smartphones, and this year 
the revenues out of smartphones roughly speaking match the total revenues of 
the dumbphones. But Nokia sells more than phone handsts. It also sells apps, 
services, and networking gear.<br>
<br>
So lets look at it in terms of size. 
There are three major business units at Nokia which derive most of the 
revenues. There is the basic phones unit, there is the newer smartphones unit, 
and there is the roots of Nokia's telecoms business (many people do not know 
this, long before Nokia made handsets, it was a telecoms networking equipment 
maker) which is now known as NokiaSiemens Networks. These guys manufacture the 
wireless telecoms infrastructure, ie the thousands of 'base stations' and 
various antenna gear etc that is needed to build a billion-dollar cellular 
network. Nokia is one of the giants of that business too, which is not well 
known, as it is a B2B (Business to Business) type of enterprise.<br>
<br>

Apple's iPhone or indeed none of Apple's products compete directly with 2/3 of 
Nokia's business (the dumbphones and the networks). Neither does any of RIM's 
Blackberry products nor any of Google's Android related initiatives. And 
Nokia's basic handset (dumbphones) unit is also profitable, and while its 
networking unit had struggled for a few years after Nokia bought the 
loss-making networking unit from former giant rival Siemens, Nokia networking 
management very efficiently turned that loss-making business around, and now 
the combined entity is profitable - albeit only marginally so. It should be 
said, that the telecoms networking business has been a huge drain on most major 
telecoms vendors - Motorola's networking unit went bankrupt, Ericsson's was 
loss-making for many years, Nortel of Canada went bankrupt and Lucent from the 
USA, also loss-making, was sold to Alcatel of France. So the NokiaSiemens 
Networking unit has been fighting a brave fight in a loss-making industry and 
turned it around to generate modest profits - that is a very good sign of good 
management.<br>
<br>
Beyond the networks, looking at phones, while RIM and 
Apple are pure smartphone makers (in the telecoms industry), Nokia is not. 
Nokia's true rivals are Samsung, Motorola, LG, SonyEricsson and ZTE - each of 
those five makes both dumbphones and smartphones. It is true that the dumbphone 
market is shifting to smartphones - they expect half of all new smartphones 
sold in the USA next year to be smartphones - that is happening in Western 
Europe now, and has already happened in some of the most advanced markets of 
the world - like my new home country of Hong Kong where half of all phones 
already are smartphones today.<br>
<br>
But Nokia dominates the 'old way' of 
dumbphones - bigger than its nearest rivals (profitably) - and it dominates the 
'future' being far bigger than any rivals in smartphones, whether they are 
classic big phone makers like Samsung or SonyEricsson of Motorola, or pure 
smartphone makers like RIM, Apple or HTC. Nokia utterly dominates the new 
smartphone market too (and does it profitably).<br>
<br>
NOKIA MISSED THE 
TRENDS... NOT !<br>
<br>
There are trends happening in smartphones. The touch 
screen phone was not invented by Apple, Nokia had its first touch screen phone 
out years before the iPhone. But Apple did what it always does, it made 
existing things far better - so we see a new world (in touch screen interfaces) 
after the iPhone - and now also in tablet PCs too (Kindle, iPad etc). This is 
similar to what Apple did to the PC industry in 1984 when it released the 
Macintosh, and all 'IBM compatible' PC makers had to adapt, where the primary 
change was the shift to Windows, Microsoft's version of attempting to copy what 
the Macintosh offered. Apple brought a new era to PCs (but was unable to 
capture a major part of that new world).<br>
<br>
Similarly now, the touch 
screen smartphone Era. I wrote about it before the iPhone was ever sold, 
promising the iPhone would accomplish this to the industry. So its nothing new, 
and it was relatively easy to predict. That kind of revolution is typical 
Apple. But Nokia did not abandon the new world like Sony abandoned the 
musicplayer market to Apple's iPod. Nokia adjusted, and it now has not just one 
touch screen phone like Apple, Nokia has of coursee a series of touch screen 
phones. They are not as good as (when considering the touch screen only) as the 
iPhone is - but who is, honestly, this is comparing a Ferrari to a Toyota for 
goodness sake - but Nokia's touch screen phones are getting better every 
generation.<br>
<br>
But while tech analysts marvel at the iPhone (and Androids 
now), the touch screen is not the only 'preferred' form factor, nor the 
'decisive' purchase criterion. Apple is the master at its user interface, but 
Nokia has for example consistenly made far better cameras on its smartphones 
than Apple. For some buyers a camera is more important. Or others insist on 
such a bizarre concept as a QWERTY keyboard haha. Or having a phone that is 
compatible with industry standards (the original iPhone didn't even support MMS 
and even the current iPhone 4 doesn't support the industry standard 3G video 
calling, etc). For those pundits who obsess about the touch screen UI 
leadership - which Apple clearly holds over any rivals in handsets - there are 
dozens of other issues of phone feature (and price) factors where Nokia has 
mastered most, and is getting ever better at the touch screen too.<br>
<br>
The 
critical point is, that Nokia can sell touch screen smartphones for a quarter 
of the price that Apple can - while still doing it profitably. (Most of the 
smartphone rivals are complaining bitterly of how expensive the smartphone 
market is, and how difficult it is to generate any profits there - note just 
this year Palm died and two very high profile smartphone/superphones were 
terminated totally, the Google Nexus One and Microsoft's short-lived Kin series 
of phones, and Lenovo has been very public in complaining about how much more 
expensive its entry into smartphones was, than what it expected).<br>
<br>
The 
original Symbian OS which powers Nokia's smartphones was not designed for touch 
screen inputs. So it had to be changed - quite a lot actually - and that has 
been a painful and costly journey. It is well along, and the latest iteration 
of the Symbian OS is said to be far better at the touch screen parts. It says a 
lot about Nokia that Symbian survived this transition where Palm died and 
Microsoft found the transition so difficult it killed off the Windows Mobile 
platform to launch a totally new one, called Phone 7 - while its market share 
crashed from near 20% to 2% in just four years. Note that while Apple's iPhone 
is a one-trick pony, and only sells a touch screen super smartphone - Nokia 
keeps selling in similar quantities of touch screen smartphones across all its 
product lines. Its like Toyota making a supercar that matches a Ferrari..<br>

<br>There is a parallel trend from basic phone pad (12 key) ie T9 inputs to 
QWERTY inputs, especially for enterprise/business users (email) and youth (SMS 
and instant messaging). This was not invented by Blackberry. The world's first 
full QWERTY smartphone was also invented by Nokia and it continues to hold a 
similar 'Blackberry-matching' market share in all QWERTY phones with its 
E-Series and other QWERTY phones. This is totally different input paradigm from 
the touch screen, and its amazing for Nokia to have been competitive in both 
(Touch and QWERTY) at the same time. Motorola told us earlier this summer that 
a third of all smartphone buyers will not consider a smartphone that doesn't 
have a QWERTY input. We heard earlier this year that the UK youth's number one 
desired phone is not the iPhone, its the Blackberry. I was just in Toronto at 
the Mobile Think Tank this week and learned from Professor Matrix of Queens 
University, that 70% of Canadian college students use a Blackberry. To me, 
always in mobile, a safe bet about the future has been to study the youth of 
today. That makes you wonder about Apple's silly strategy of not giving us a 
QWERTY variant to the iPhone. RIM offers touch input versions of the 
Blackberry, why can't Apple give us a QWERTY iPhone? Nokia offers both of 
course as makes sense in this market.<br>
<br>
There is a third parallel trend 
in smartphones, from business phones to consumer phones. This trend was 
captured by the iPhone but not invented by Apple. Who invented the 
consumer-only smartphone? Nokia. And it utterly dominates this space worldwide. 
Some classic smartphone vendors and systems (Palm, Microsoft) have suffered in 
trying to cope with this shift. Blackberry's big global rise has been driven by 
this shift (as the youth - ie consumer not enterprise customers - have fallen 
in love with the Blackberry). And Nokia invented the consumer smartphone, 
utterly crushingly devastatingly dominates it, and leads it. And this shift is 
far more price-sensitive than the enterprise/corporate phones market, so 
super-premium prices 'superphones' like the iPhone 4 or Samsung Galaxy or 
Blackberry Torch will be mostly out of reach to the true mass market consumer 
segment. But Nokia's sub 200 dollar 'basic' smartphones play perfectly there. 
If you always wanted a Ferrari but couldn't afford it, perhaps you bought 
yourself a Toyota MR 2 sportscar or a Ford Mustang. That is the Nokia mid-price 
smartphone. Nowhere near as great as the iPhone but nowhere near as expensive, 
and being of Nokia quality and brand and sales channel - it will dominate the 
market.<br>
<br>
The fourth shift in smartphones is the price trend to the 
sub-100 dollar smartphone for the mass market. Again a shift that Nokia 
initiated and is mastering today with few real rivals (Samsung the strongest to 
try this tactic too, with its Bada based smartphones that were only launched 
earlier this year).<br>
<br>
So in sum about Nokia today, it is the biggest, 
most dominant dumbphone maker. Nokia is offering ever cheaper 'Africa phones' 
and keeps providing features and abilites that many rivals ignore, specific to 
the less wealthy customers - replacable batteries, critical in countries of 
poor electricity supply - in-built FM radios - surprisingly for many in the 
poorest countries the first ever FM radio they have owned, is the one that 
comes with the new Nokia phone. Etc. In the emerging world market, where all 
the growth is now in dumbphones - Nokia's market share is above 50%. And they 
manage this profitably. Tell me this is not good execution?<br>
<br>
And Nokia 
is also a network equipment maker. It bought Siemens's giant but loss-making 
networking unit, and turned it around and now NokiaSiemens Networks makes some 
profits, in a sector of the industry where profits are very rare to see. That 
to me speaks excellent management in very difficult conditions.<br>
<br>
And 
Nokia is also a smartphone maker - the biggest in the industry, with the 
best-selling smartphone OS as well. Nokia invented the smartphone and has 
launched or pioneered all of the four major trends in smartphones. And even its 
OS, the most advanced smartphone OS in the world in 2007 when the iPhone 
launched - almost all upgrades to the iPhone were actually 'bug fixes' to try 
to make the iOS as good as Symbian - is now having a migration plan to a 
totally new smartphone OS, based on MeeGo. Both Symbian and MeeGo are open 
source OS's that conform to indsutry standards, and are supported by many 
manufacturers. That is the right strategy for Nokia (while it would not 
necessarily be the optimal strategy for a specialist niche maker like Apple or 
RIM).<br>
<br>
MISSED THE APP STORE<br>
<br>
And I should mention the App 
Stores. While all the silly hype globally in mobile is about apps - I have been 
repeating and repeating and repeating, that it is a trivial - trivial - sized 
non-business (today). It may - it may - become meaningful somewhere years down 
the line. We heard from Apple - the leader in app stores - earlier this year, 
that the total earned by the Apple iPhone App Store last year was under a 
billion dollars. A billion out of what, over 200,000 actual apps that exist in 
the App Store?<br>
<br>
A billion may seem like a &quot;big number&quot; to 
those who don't understand mobile, but hey, Crazy Frog the ringing tone - yes 
just one - one - ringing tone - sold half a billion dollars - in paid downloads 
to mobile phone users - in one year - three years before Apple even opened up 
its app store. Put that into your iPhone app and think again. What is the 
bestselling category on the iPhone&nbsp; - games. What is the bestselling game? 
Angry Birds. Sold what, 4 million copies. This is the best game on the 
'amazing' App Store. But we mentioned on this blog years ago, that Artificial 
Life's side-line product (their main business is TV-mobile interactive services 
like SMS TV games etc) - a mobile Java game called 'V-Girl' the Virtual 
Girlfriend on your phone - sold 4 million copies. Paid downloads and paid 
customers to mobile phones, not smartphones, globally, years before Angry 
Birds. 4 million is nothing amazing to the mobile industry. Its a nice number 
yes, but what is the record-breaking achievement in the tiny sandbox called 
iPhone, is trivial to the big world of mobile. You want paid downloads to 
mobile? Try Tetris. Sold 100 million copies to mobile phones and counting.<br>

<br>The total global mobile phone app market last year was worth 5 billion 
dollars (said Chetan Sharma Consulting). Most of that was not consumer-oriented 
app store applications. No, most of that was enterprise/corporate solutions to 
integrate IT apps like SAP and Oracle to mobile. Then the comparison - SMS text 
messaging alone is worth 100 Billion dollars. Mobile data is worth 250 Billion 
dollars. App Stores are less than meaningful (today). Yes, from small things, 
big things can grow. But the hysteria about app stores is totally ridiculous 
today. I did a meticulous calculation of the futility of investing in apps 
today, and showed with rigorous analysis and facts that half of developers of 
paid apps will not make a profit in less than 11 years, and for the free apps 
(ie used in advertising and marketing) the prospects are far worse than that 
even.<br>
<br>
One should not even bother to mention the word 'apps' not even 
when discussing the business of Apple or Google today. Its that tiny. And for 
Nokia, who cares. Yet... Yet... Yet... years before there was an iPhone App 
Store, there was a Nokia app store. The first generation of iPhones would not 
even let users install apps to it! All Nokia smartphones have allowed users to 
install apps for all of the past decade. If you seriously think that there is a 
trend to apps in the phone business, then yes, Nokia saw it long before the 
current hysteria, and had built its app offering and business systematically. 
We know the latest iteration of Nokia's app store as Ovi - incidentially the 
world's third best-selling app store for those who care about the lives of ants 
in the world of elephants.<br>
<br>
PERCEPTION PROBLEM<br>
<br>
Against this 
light, Nokia is 'accused' of 'failing' because of three major faults. Its 
flagship phone is not seen as good enough to go against the iPhone. Its profits 
have been declining (some might say perilously). And Nokia has lost most of its 
market share in the US market where Blackberry, the iPhone and various Android 
phones now are popular. So by faulty leap of logic, many see that Nokia is 
somehow 'losing to iPhone' (or Android or Blackberry). In reality that is a 
market anomaly that applies to North America only, where only 8% of the 
planet's mobile phones are sold..&nbsp; Nokia utterly dominates the rest of the 
world (with the exception of those countries where strong domestic rivals 
control that country, South Korea, Japan and yes, the USA).<br>
<br>
The 
reality is that recently the iPhone market share has been declining (four 
quarters in a row) where Nokia's market share held steady or actually grew. The 
reality is that in the past 12 months, Nokia smartphones have been winning 
against the iPhone, not losing to it. The numbers are irrefutable, but the myth 
prevails that Nokia is somehow 'losing' and specifically 'losing to the 
iPhone'. This is a perception problem! This is a communication problem. Not a 
strategy problem and not an execution problem. All the new CEO needs to do, is 
to communicate Nokia's true performance more clearly than previous Nokia 
managers have done in the past. The numbers are very clear. How awesome is that 
for Mr Elop, he gets the media attention for being the new guy, and he has a 
wonderful story to tell, where he does not need to 'fix Nokia' but rather just 
elaborate clearly what Nokia is doing. Awesome?<br>
<br>
Nokia profits have 
been declining - as one might expect in a global economic downturn where many 
'gold standard' corporations of impeccable credit ratings went bankrupt. Yes, 
Nokia should be able to do better than it is doing, but every other big 5 
handset maker has seen either quarterly losses, or severely declining profits 
in the past few years, including Nokia's nearest true rival - Samsung. As this 
is a 'partly true' issue, the new CEO needs to tackle it on two sides - address 
the actual profitability rigorously, but also communicate it far more clearly - 
that Nokia as a mass market consumer phone maker - should be compared to 
Samsung, LG, SonyEricsson and Motorola (and ZTE) - and compared to any of 
those, Nokia profits are very good. And then just make sure as CEO, that those 
profits will now turn into growth again, as the economy improves - and probably 
with some strategic decisions about focus areas.<br>
<br>
The North American 
market situation is the trickiest communication problem. If there are 5.1 
Billion mobile phone subscribers on the planet - and the option is to be the 
best-selling phone for that part which is 285 million of those - or the 
remaining part which is 4.815 Billion mobile phone users - Nokia has focused 
correctly. Yes, it should do better in the US market, and Stephen Elop gets a 
fresh chance to turn Nokia around in the USA, but the shareholders need to be 
told much more about how enormous the market is globally, compared to the 
pretty trivial-sized US market in phones. That is not the same in television or 
personal computers or cars or airplanes etc - most other industries the role of 
the US market is very big. In mobile, it is very small (as a percentage of the 
world).<br>
<br>
SANTA CLAUS CAME FOR MR ELOP WITH FREEBIE GIFTS<br>
<br>
There 
are few things that were long in the pipeline, that will now come as gifts to 
the new CEO. Most of all, is the migration of Symbian OS to touch screens. That 
was a time-consuming long journey, it is not over, but it is now far along. 
Soon Symbian will be 'just as good' as most in the multi-touch experiences. 
That will bode very well for Nokia smartphones. Nokia's touch screen interface 
will not need to be 'better' than the iPhone - nor even 'as good as' the 
iPhone, as long as Nokia's touch screen interface is 'good enough'. That was 
the lesson we learned in the PC industry with Windows vs Macintosh. The Mac was 
always better. Always! The early Windows versions were horrible up to Windows 
3.0 in 1990, when finally Microsoft released an 'Macintosh clone' that was good 
enough. Not as good, but good enough. And the rest is history. Microsoft used 
its scale to crush Apple, even where Mac was always better. That is where we 
are with Symbian today. It need not be better or even as good as the iPhone. 
All Symbian needs, is to be good enough. It is very likely that the current new 
about-to-be released version is good enough (that powers the N8) but even if 
its not quite there yet, Nokia will keep evolving and improving the touch 
screen parts of the OS, and will become good enough, soon enough. This is a 
freebie gift to Mr Elop. He will be seen to have saved Symbian and Nokia in the 
process..<br>
<br>
There is the new N8. It seems by early opinions to be a 
long-overdue hit flagship for Nokia. Remember that Nokia's last succesful 
flagship - the N95 - handily outsold the iPhone globally. Nokia has the carrier 
relationships to turn a good phone into a big hit and the N8 seems to be very 
well poised to do well. It comes to a crowded market with the Samsung Galaxy 
now the big dog of the yard, with the iPhone 4 a very strong contender, and 
various other superphone wannabes, from Motorola Droids to Blackberry Torches 
to Lenovo LePhones out there. But Nokia has the world's best carrier partner 
network - if the carriers like the N8, it will become the planet's best-selling 
superphone, almost by default. This is all someting Stephen Elop was not in any 
way involved with, yet he stands to reep the rewards of the work that was done 
before him.<br>
<br>
Apple's sudden decline comes also at optimal timing for 
the new CEO of Nokia. The actual peak of the iPhone market share has already 
happened (the iPhone had 17% of smartphone market share this time last year, 
they are now down to either 14% or 13% depending on which analyst numbers you 
look - every analyst now acknowledges that the iPhone has peaked and is losing 
market share globally). But the timing is close enough, that any 'revival' by 
Nokia can be seen mirroring a decline by Apple - and from now forward, it will 
be credited to the new CEO, even though he actually had nothing to do with 
that. But it will help create some image of Stephen Elop as a miracle maker if 
analysts a few years later start believing a legend that Elop came to save 
Nokia and in doing that, he defeated Apple's unstoppable gains in smartphones. 
(as I have written in my iPhone strategy blog - Apple now needs to diversify 
its iPhone portfolio and until it does that, it will see erosion of its market 
share, most of all to Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy)<br>
<br>
ALL IS 
NOT PEACHY<br>
<br>
So far its been a love-fest here with the Communities 
Dominate blog admiring Nokia.. Well, all is not well. There are indeed real 
problems too. But please lets be very clear, the problem at Nokia is not 
anything to do with its 'smartphones strategy' and mostly not even with its 
smartphones execution, nor with the Symbian OS and the future strategy of the 
smartphone OS into MeeGo. So please understand, Nokia's smartphone strategy is 
the best in the business, and any shift to Android for example would be stupid, 
abandoning a huge market lead and total control of its future, to the whims of 
Google's 'do no evil' strategies..<br>
<br>
Most of all any business is about 
profits. The Nokia of old was a profit factory. Massive profits in this 
fast-moving and dynamic industry. Not so often the actual inventor (Japan's NTT 
DoCoMo has most true inventions in the mobile space), but being the fast 
follower, Nokia was well picking winning concepts (cameraphones, consumer 
smartphones) but made its stumbles too (N-Gage). Nokia was very good also at 
keeping to its vision - not for example taking the populist view from 2006 that 
flip phones would take over the world (anyone remember the Razr). And Nokia 
would often time its mass market launches with particular precision - consider 
its 3G phones for example.<br>
<br>
Now Nokia's profits have shrunk to 
razor-thin. Some of that was due to the global economic downturn (remember, 3 
of its rivals in the big 5 handset makers reported losses in their handset 
business during this economic crisis - Nokia never did. Its only loss of the 
past decade was one quarter during this economic crisis, when the NokiaSiemens 
unit's losses were bigger than the profits made in the handsets unit. One 
quarter, this after Nokia absorbed Siemens's loss-making networking unit and 
was fighting during the economic crisis, to turn it around).<br>
<br>
But some 
of it is no doubt historical cost reasons. Nokia is a complex organization with 
much design and R&amp;D overlap - quite costly. Its R&amp;D processes are slow, 
painfully slow compared to 'internet speed' rivals like say Google. Here a 
successful 'West Coast' manager from Microsoft no doubt can help a lot in 
forcing much-needed changes to streamline Nokia's design and development work.
<br><br>
There is the question about synergies between the Networking unit, 
NokiaSiemens Networks and the rest of Nokia. When I joined Nokia in the 1990s, 
the networking side was the bigger side with most of the staff and most of the 
revenues. Now it has become the little brother in the big picture. Is there a 
synergy? That is hard to find, and most rivals who tried to do the synergy 
route, have abandoned it - Ericsson, Motorola, Siemens (used to be a Top 5 
handset maker, it abandoned its handsets unit first to focus just on networks, 
in the past decade). And the NSN unit is a drain on profitability, even if they 
manage miniscule profits in the unit. By divesting NSN, Nokia could focus more 
on its core business - related to handsets - and instantly get a jump on the 
profitability of the company.<br>
<br>
This would be a painful change, but 
Nokia has done that many many times before - it once made paper. Nokia was once 
for its main business being rubber. Nokia once had the majority of its business 
out of home electronics like TV sets. IT once made personal computers 
(primarily for the domestic Finnish market, Nokia's MicroMikko was an 
IBM-compatible PC running Microsoft operating systems). Nokia once made WiFi 
equipment, Broadband equipment, etc etc. They have not been afraid to abandon 
businesses that did not show promise for the future. It may be time for Nokia 
to get rid of NSN, and if so, a new CEO, in these times of poor profits, 
especially as an outsider and non-Finn, with no internal loyalties to worry 
about - this is something Stephen Elop will no doubt be considering. Coming 
from Microsoft's unit looking at the future of the PC side, cloud computing etc 
- will give particular insights into what kind of synergies may be useful in 
the near future - in evaluating the value of NSN to Nokia as a strategic asset, 
or whether they try to get rid of it now while it is marginally profitable.<br>

<br>There is the issue of becoming a box-mover. The basic phone is becoming a 
commodity product, and if we plot the price of basic phones with Moore's Law, 
by the end of this decade, a cheap cameraphone for Africa will cost 1 dollar. 
How long is it worthwhile to try to fight for that ultra-cheap market and what 
strategic moves if any, Nokia may want to make in that space.<br>
<br>

Simultaneously we see shifts from hardware to software, from phones to apps. Is 
it the services model (cloud computing etc) or the app store. What are the 
profitable opportunities in mobile for a phone maker. What of Navteq, of Nokia 
Money, or mobile avertising, the Ovi store, etc etc etc. There are lots of 
opportunities, but also lots of endless pits of wasted effort in mobile, where 
the profits will never come.<br>
<br>
There is management overhead. The world 
is going ever more lean. I have not seen any recent Nokia organizational 
charts, but probably there is room to cut some areas that drain managment 
resources but deliver little value to the bottom line. And where once Nokia 
Mobile Phones was a young person's job, today those former young graduates are 
middle-aged, and have seen the salaries grow and perhaps the hunger of wanting 
to become the biggest phone maker in the world has dimmed in their eyes. I 
honestly do not know, but I would not be surprised, if there weren't many 
middle to senior managers who really should be moved on. The Finnish employment 
culture - and that at Nokia - rewards loyalty and makes it difficult to lay off 
people. But the opportunity is good when a new CEO comes in; the opportunity is 
greater still, if the company has been seeing a dangerous decline in profits. 
This is a time to consider staff cuts (and not just in management, obviously)
<br><br>
SO WELCOME STEPHEN ELOP<br>
<br>
There is so much to an Fortune Global 
500 sized company CEO job description that I cannot even start to imagine. Most 
of the work Mr Elop will be doing is stuff we'd never even bother to write 
about on this blog. But Nokia is the gorilla in the room, when it comes to the 
mobile industry. So very many of the stories we discuss here, will invariably 
touch upon Nokia, or feature Nokia.<br>
<br>
I do feel that Olli-Pekka 
Kallasvuo got a 'raw deal' in how he was kicked out. But also, that there were 
some good reasons as well, and that I could well see why the shareholders felt 
that was needed. The Chief Executive Officer of Nokia had lost the trust of the 
owners of the company, and therefore, could not really sustain the trust of the 
Board either. It was a hard choice for Chairman Jorma Ollila and his Board, but 
once that decision was made, they did need a new CEO.<br>
<br>
I do think that 
the very superficial view to Stephen Elop's past suggest he could be a great 
CEO for Nokia. He is a North American, he knows the way to talk to North 
American press and analysts and investors - that is where most of Nokia shares 
are held. He comes from the PC and software side of the tech industry, a 
welcome infusion of new thinking to top management at Nokia. He is a Canadian - 
a nationality that seems to gell particularly well with Finns (maybe its all 
that ice hockey - the greatest ever ice hockey player, the one they called 'the 
Greatest' ie Wayne Gretzky, a Canadian, did after all get most of his points 
scored, by setting up passes to a Finn - Jari Kurri his long-time 
scorer-sniper, who in turn is of course the greatest-ever Finn to play ice 
hockey. Both are obviously inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame..).<br>
<br>
I 
made the joke speaking in Toronto this week, that Finland has just appointed 
its first-ever Canadian Vice Prime Minster - arguably the CEO of Nokia is 
perhaps the second most powerful man in the domestic Finnish economy 
haha..&nbsp; Or maybe its the long dark winters, the snow, who knows. A lot of 
Finns have migrated to Canada, so there is a kinship too, probably most 
Canadians know at least someone who has Finnish heritage. And we are both large 
countries geographically, with small populations, in the shadow of superpowers. 
You learn perhaps a certain level of humility and willingness to compromise, if 
you are bordering on the USA or Russia/Soviet Union..<br>
<br>
So, all you you 
out there who are screaming for Nokia to shift now to Android. Get over it. It 
will never happen. Nokia has a robust and good mobile phones-optimized 
smartphone OS called Symbian, a fully open source OS supported by dozens of 
handset manufacturers. It also has a new OS coming up, called MeeGo, also open 
source, also supported by many manufacturers, but is now fresh and new, and 
Linux based. What more could you want? If Nokia abandoned all that leadership, 
and surrendered to the whims of Google, that would be a colossal mistake. And 
Nokia does not do colossal mistakes. It does stumble as any handset maker will 
stumble (iPhone Death Grip, anyone?) The N97 was a rare Nokia stumble, but that 
pain is just about over. I would be very confident in believing that at least 
the N8 will not be seen as a failure in its early reviews the way the N97 was 
received.<br>
<br>
There is a new man now at the helm of Nokia. The 
shareholders have been satisfied, it is not another Finn, and not someone from 
the inside, who might have been 'poisoned' with too much 'Finnishness' or 
'Nokia-think' so the shareholders should now be happy for the short run. But 
the really weird part is, that Nokia is pretty well poised to outperform its 
other big 5 handset maker rivals into the foreseeable future. Nokia will never 
generate as huge profit margins as Apple, but if Nokia's profits turn now from 
decline into growth - then Stephen Elop will be seen as the savior, the 
miracle-maker, the man who defeated the Apple iPhone challenge and saved Nokia. 
While that may not technically be true, it will be a far better story for the 
Nokia PR people to spin, than the past year of explaining why the N8 was again 
delayed...<br>
<br>
Good luck Stephen Elop. You are landing in the coolest job 
on the planet and may your reign be long and prosperous.</p>

<h2>September 08, 2010</h2> 
<h3>Is the 50 Billion mobile subscriber number feasible for this decade?</h3> 
<p>I have recently heard several times the number that the future of 
mobile/cellular connected devices will leap ten-fold from today, when we have 5 
Billion mobile phone subscriptions to 50 Billion, usually expected to happen 
during this decade.<br>
<br>
First, lets be very clear, in the past decade we 
did grow 10-fold in mobile (vs only 3-fold growth in the internet for example). 
And yes, I do believe in dramatic growth to come in mobile, so I am all for the 
expectations to be big. We will easily double from today's 5 Billion during 
this next decade, easily! We may be growing 3-fold or even more than that. But 
10-fold in one decade? That does beg the question: is this feasible.<br>
<br>

The planet has only 6.8 Billion people. So the 50 Billion number has to include 
lots of devices per person, as well as a lot of non-human connections, whether 
devices, household gadgets, cars, etc; as well as other living beings like 
pets, farmyard animals and even connecting other things like plants.<br>
<br>

LETS START WITH HUMANS<br>
<br>
Yes, so the biggest usable number we can start 
with, is the human population. 6.8 Billion people. In a very rough term, we can 
expect that the mobile phone subscription penetration rate globally will pass 
about 120% human population per capita during this decade (at least). That 
means that the world would match roughly what is normal in Europe today.&nbsp; 
But that gets us only 8.2 Billion subscriptions. Nowhere near enough.<br>
<br>

Ok, lets take the UAE example (this is Abu Dhabi, Dubai etc the oil-rich 
Emirates on the Arabian Peninsula). The UAE became the first country to pass 
200% mobile phone subscriptions per capita. If we assume that to happen for the 
whole planet, that would get us to 13.6 Billion.<br>
<br>
This is our biggest 
number and we do need to pump it as much as possible to get us to the 50 
Billion. So 2 phones per person are not enough. Lets add in a laptop per 
person. Whether its a netbook or iPad or Kindle or a notebook, lets say the 
planet gets a laptop for every person - and by the end of the decade that will 
of course have a 3G or faster connection. 3 mobile subscriptions per person 
(not inconceivable, I for example walk around daily with 3 subscriptions, have 
done so since 2003). If we multiply the planet's population with 3 
subscriptions we pass the 20 Billion mark, and arrive at 20.4 Billion. Thats a 
good start. Now lets turn to our car.<br>
<br>
GROWTH RATE<br>
<br>
What of the 
growth rate? The population of the planet keeps growing. Yes, thats true. But 
the population of the planet today is 6.8 Billion people in 2010. By 
definition, all new born humans between 2010 and 2020 will still be pre-teens 
by the end of the decade. All will be less than 10 years old, half will be 5 
years old or younger. This is not the target market for new mobile phone 
subscriptions. A few of the 7-8-9 year olds perhaps, but thats not enough to 
push us far above current 6.8 Billion level, in particular that for those few 
of the eldest in this group, we then have to balance out those elderly people 
who will be dying in this decade. In terms of a viable 'mobile phone age' 
population, what is the total population of 6.8 Billion people today, can be 
seen to be the viable mobile phone aged population a decade from now.<br>
<br>

CARS<br>
<br>
So the car. We've heard the internet people like Google and Yahoo 
say that the next internet is mobile; and in the countries where the internet 
is already fully mobile (South Korea, Japan etc) they say the next internet is 
in the car. That will give us a nice boost to our count. Imagine one day when 
every car is connected. Roughly a quarter of all cars in South Korea are 
already connected to the internet.<br>
<br>
Or will it? The world has under 1 
Billion automobiles! If we assume one car-related subscription that comes with 
the new car when we buy it, to connect to the maps and security systems and 
self-diagnostics and on-board games etc - we only add 1 Billion mobile 
subscriptions to the planet. Thats not much when we consider our ambitious 50 
Billion target. Funny to say that, one billion is not much...&nbsp; But yes, 
adding cars, we're at 21.4 Billion so far.<br>
<br>
Note, the car may have 
multiple subscriptions, as we may for example use our normal phone service, 
take out the SIM card from the phone and insert it into the car's SIM card 
slot. That would give the car 2 subscriptions (for a short duration) but then 
upon our person we'd go down from 3 subscriptions to 2, as one was temporarily 
assigned to the car. It would not add to the total. And for the car makers, it 
makes no sense to split their data traffic to many mobile operators, rather to 
accumulate their total traffic load and negotiate with all carriers/mobile 
operators to get the best bulk deal for the whole fleet of cars, on one 
network. So only one new SIM card per car.<br>
<br>
CAMERA, PSP<br>
<br>
So 
then we have the other stand-alone digital gadgets, like the advanced digital 
cameras by Canon, Nikon etc; or the portable gaming systems like the Nintendos 
and Playstatoin Portables. Lets connect these all to 3G networks. Sounds very 
plausible.<br>
<br>
Except the numbers are trivially small, compared to mobile. 
The mobile industry sells 1.3 Billion new mobile phones every year (with a 
replacement cycle of 17 months). Stand-alone digital cameras sell 103 million 
per year (says Morgan Stanley in 2009). Similarly pocketable stand-alone gaming 
devices sell 48 million units. Portable multimedia players including DVD 
players sell 130 million. Pocket music players including the iPod sell about 
127 million units (same source for all). These numbers are very very small. 
Even if we add them all together, we arrive at 408 million devices per year. 
Even if every one of them was now suddenly made 3G compatible with a mobile 
data subscription, in ten years of sales we'd only hit 4 Billion more connected 
devices. But we should assume growth, so lets double that number and we arrive 
at 8 Billion connected personal stand-alone (non mobile phone based) digital 
gadgets. Now our cumulative number hits 29.4 Billion. We are starting to get 
there..<br>
<br>
WHAT OF THE HOME?<br>
<br>
Ah, then the homes.. We can have 
our washing machine connected to the web (there are some that are sold already 
that offer internet connectivity). And the coffee maker. What else? The 
microwave oven? The fridge definitely. And the (intelligent) vacuum cleaner? 
The problem here is that we only have 1.7 Billion households on the planet. So 
while yes, we can probably imagine 4 or 5 household gadgets today that could 
easily imagine being connected, and another couple likely to come - most 
obviously the home robot (South Korea already has consumer-oriented household 
robot stores in major shopping malls). If we say 6 connected gadgets in the 
home, we'd arrive at 10.2 Billion more to add to our total. This is good, now 
we are at 39.6 Billion.<br>
<br>
HOME METERING<br>
<br>
We actually have 
another issue with the homes too. That is metering of our utilities. Water, 
electricity and gas metering. The modern way to do utilities metering is with a 
digital meter, connected wirelessly to the network. Lets say 2 utilities meters 
per household, and we add another 3.4 Billion connections and arrive at 43.0 
Billion. We're almost there...<br>
<br>
PETS<br>
<br>
So next lets connect our 
pets. We have intelligent dog collars for hunting dogs for example, and the 
dogs-to-humans translator (Bowlingual) which translates dog sounds to SMS 
messages for humans of what the dog is trying to say. I have no idea how many 
household pets there are, but I think its safe to say, the proportion of pets 
is far less than the total number of households, even as some households may 
have more than one pet.<br>
<br>
What number is reasonable, I don't know. Lets 
work on the upside and say, on average there is a pet in one third of all 
households (my guess is that the number is smaller but no doubt someone among 
our readers will know it). That gives us 560 million connected pets. With a bit 
of rounding off, we are now at 43.6 Billion.<br>
<br>
FARMYARD ANIMALS<br>
<br>

Then it starts to get difficult. What of farmyard animals? Yes, there are cows 
that are called to milk via an old mobile phone or beeper hanging on their 
neck, and when the cow hears the arrival of SMS (or the ringing of a phone call 
- no danger, the cow won't answer so there won't be billable calling traffic to 
the farmer) the cow knows to come home to be milked. Except that where cow 
herds can be big, cows are herding animals, so all the farmer needs to do, is 
connect the lead cow, and the others will follow. No, cows won't get us there. 
We may get some millions of connections, but this math won't even start to work 
until we look at billions, or at least major fractions of billions.<br>
<br>
I 
am sure there are plenty of uses for near field connections for all sorts of 
sensors to enable something like digital farming, to identify animals, but 
those don't need cellular network connectivity. So I don't foresee SIM cards in 
chicken or pigs or sheep..<br>
<br>
TREES<br>
<br>
So then lets move from 
animals to plants. I've told the story of modern forestry management, where 
trees are tagged with devices containing GPS-GSM chips, for intelligent digital 
forest management. They can actually tag trees in forests of a million trees. 
But these gadgets are relatively expensive, and there is no point in paying for 
their cellular connectivity for the 20 to 30 year life that the tree spends 
growing to full size before it is felled. Again I am not a lumberjack but to me 
the clever way to use this technology is for some forest 'manager' to go 
tagging trees that need to be felled, with the intelligent GSM-GPS devices. But 
not to tag all trees, only those scheduled for the next round of cuts in the 
forest. And for the tagging devices to be recovered at the saw mill, and 
re-used. So for a forest of a million trees that has been managed well, so it 
has an even balance of trees of all ages, then about 5% of the trees reach 
maturity any one year. Thats only 50,000 trees to fell per year. If we split 
that by weeks, its 1,000 trees cut per week. I don't need 1 million SIM cards, 
I need 1,000. Maybe 2 or 3 thousand just to have some spare capacity, but not a 
million per forest.. Trees won't get us there either.<br>
<br>
What of our 
plants at home? Yes, we have the clever plants-to-humans communications by 
AgriHouse of Japan who offer the humidity sensors to plants that send SMS 
messages to the owner saying when the plants need to be watered. If you have 20 
plants in your home, and really want this level of technology to monitor each 
plant, yes, we could quickly pass 50 Billion subscriptions. But I do not 
foresee most homes having this technology. Yes, some will love it, but most 
not. And even those who will use it, will probably not need it for all plants. 
And the technology need not have a cellular connection, the more logical way of 
doing this is to coordinate with the home connectivity center (a home WiFi 
connection center and/or femtocell for example).<br>
<br>
OK LETS TOSS IN MONEY
<br><br>
We are still about 6 Billion short of the magic 50 Billion number. Ok. 
Then lets go radical and say mobile banking. I am a firm believer in mobile 
banking and mobile money and payments. I am however, very well aware that the 
banking and money industry moves very slowly, is very conservative. It is not 
rushing to mobile. And there are many technical ways to do mobile payments and 
mobile banking and mobile wallets, which do not all require a separate 
subscription and/or additional SIM card.<br>
<br>
But one of the preferred 
solutions is what for example was deployed in South Korea, where on the phone 
you have one SIM card for your telecoms needs, and a banking-specific SIM card 
for all your money needs including banking, payments, credit cards, loyalty 
cards etc. The one SIM cards is compatible with all South Korean banks and 
credit cards etc, so its just a question of a given bank or provider enabling 
their account onto your banking SIM card. And then if you need to move your 
banking services to a newer phone, you can do so simply by inserting the SIM 
card to your new phone.<br>
<br>
So far so good. If we now assume all 6.8 
Billion people on the planet get a mobile wallet/mobile banking service that 
adds yet one more SIM card, we do reach the 50 Billion number. But in all 
honesty, this won't happen to all people on the planet (kids for example) and 
definitely won't happen in one decade.<br>
<br>
NUMBER CAN BE SEEN AS FEASIBLE
<br><br>
But is it plausible? We had some very severe assumptions there in that 
quick analysis. Assumptions that are quite deadly to the target number.<br>
<br>
Lets start with the human 3 SIM card target. That could be seen to be 
reasonable for adult and employed populations. But teenagers and retired 
people? 3 SIM cards? Teenagers, Maybe. But the elderly? One mobile phone 
subscription, certainly. Two, maybe. Three? Unlikely for all of the elderly. In 
many cases a retired couple could get one iPad style device perhaps - to share 
among the pair. I think the 3 mobile subscriptions per person concept is not 
really viable for the whole global population. Not in this decade (yet)<br>
<br>
Next lets go to the households. We thought that each household would have 6 
connected gadgets. Well, actually that number is implausible because of the 
lack of electricity. 1.6 Billion people live without electricity according to 
CNN in 2008, so if we take the average household size of 4 people per household 
globally, thats 400 million households without electricity. No electricity, no 
clever digital household gadgets either. We just lost 2.4 Billion connections 
and a further 800 million metering connections.<br>
<br>
Of the portable 
digital gadgets, with the 8 Billion number. That was a lot of 
smoke-and-mirrors. A cheap MP3 player won't gain from a 3G data connection - it 
would be a very sad rival to a musicphone but would add the monthly connection 
fee, while not offering telecoms connectivity (not being a phone). Not 
plausible. If the consumer wants to buy a stand-alone MP3 player, that will 
then have very particular music needs, and that person will definitely own a 
smartphone also, towards the second half of this decade. No, the MP3 players 
will not be networked on the cellular network (mostly. Some premium iPods 
probably will offer the connectivity but even those, mostly will not connect to 
the cellular, and will rather connect via WiFi).<br>
<br>
The worse assumption 
is that all 8 Billion sold gadgets are still used by the end of 2020. While the 
replacement cycle for non-phone portable gadgets is longer than the replacement 
cycle for phones, certainly a significant fraction of the total cumulative 
sales of that number were replacement units, of better capability, sold to the 
same consumer. So we need to cut the 8 Billion number down by several billion..
<br><br>
Then we have issues with poverty, with illiteracy (800 million people 
of reading age are illiterate worldwide - illiterates will not need a laptop 
surely, and probably won't have much need of more than one phone in most 
cases), with wars, famines, and refugees. The victims of natural and man-made 
disasters will not be accumulating multiple IT devices..<br>
<br>
50 BILLION IS 
NOT PLAUSIBLE<br>
<br>
I do like visions of big growth numbers in mobile. I do 
like the bold predictions to suggest big growth, to counter those who peddle 
the tired myth that we are somehow at saturation or near saturation in mobile. 
I also like the guidance by the mobilists and futurists, who look at the past 
decade, observe that mobile grew 10-fold in that decade, faster than any other 
technology of significant size - and then to argue that the same rate of growth 
would continue this decade, another full decade of growth of 10-fold. And that 
kind of provocative argument does suggest those considering the market 
opportunity to also focus on who and what is to be connected, to understand we 
will run out of humans to connect, very soon, and the growth will need to be 
made from other devices and gadgets and pets and so forth.<br>
<br>
But to me, 
the plausible number of mobile phone subscriptions for the end of this decade 
is somewhere in the 15 Billion to 30 Billion range, not in the 50 Billion 
range. I will be most happy to be proven wrong, but just please do take some 
sanity checks on the assumptions. Some of the fantasies and science fiction 
views are dramatic yes, but the numbers do not add up. Lets try to be realistic 
when giving guidance about the near future.</p>

<h2>August 30, 2010</h2> 
<h3>Convergence Contest? For the 5 Trillion dollar Trophy.</h3> 
<p>Vacations are good for fresh thinking. I started today's morning preparing 
to come back to work and my mind was buzzing with thoughts of the truly big 
picture. Last spring and summer I often got caught up with the minutiae of the 
percentage in market share or the next user number in text messages or the 
latest added consumers to mobile, etc. But there is a big picture to it all. 
The Contest for Convergence for the 5 Trillion Dollar Trophy.<br>
<br>
To 
understand how enormous number we are looking at, its more than ten times 
bigger than the global computer industry including all PC hardware from 
desktops to laptops and netbooks and tablet PCs like the Kindle and iPad... 
plus the applications and software industry enabled by the PC industry. Take 
all that, and multiply that by ten! Or take television and radio, the total 
broadcast industry - and multiply it by 15. Or take the global internet and all 
its revenues out of Google adwords and broadband fees etc, all of the internet 
revenues - and multiply that by 20. We are looking at the biggest economic 
prize of our lifetimes, and it is 'in play' as we speak, with Fortune 500 
giants like Nokia, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Vodafone, Microsoft, Sony, 
Samsung etc all angling to be one of the winners in this ultimate race of the 
decade, perhaps even the race of the century. So a quick review of where we 
stand.<br>
<br>
I have been preaching the convergence story in each of my 9 
books and was personally involved in the early stages of the digital 
convergence, from creating the world's first computer company advertisement to 
the internet (media and internet convergence) to leading the team that created 
the world's first fixed-mobile converged solution (fixed and mobile telecoms 
convergence) to authoring early documents on the future of convergence (at 
Nokia's Telephony Gateways digital convergence unit, I authored the first White 
Paper for the industry to discuss how to do the internet on mobile). That was 
all more than a decade ago when I was actively involved in 'doing it' rather 
than a consultant 'preaching it' haha...&nbsp; But I do know quite a lot about 
the realities of digital convergence not only from studying the matter, but 
from doing it myself.<br>
<br>
So its no surprise to my readers and fans, and 
readers at this blog, that I believe passionately in digital convergence. So 
lets not review my view. Lets see what some others have said about digital 
convergence 'recently' - say past few years.<br>
<br>
COMPUTERS, MEDIA<br>
<br>

The computer industry is headed to mobile. After Apple introduced the iPhone in 
2007, and changed its name from Apple Computer to Apple, and now calls itself a 
mobile company, the bigger computer maker rivals have all joined the chorus. 
Now Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer etc all sing of the same hymn book. The future of 
the computer industry is mobile. Maybe that is not a big surprise, they have 
been predicting the pocket computer for two decades already..<br>
<br>
The 
media industries are more interesting. The (former) Director General of the BBC 
said that all broadcast content will be available on mobile (and BBC's 
successful iPlayer is a perfect example of how a broadcaster can take a big 
slice out of the digital convergence into mobile). The CEOs of the major media 
giants from Publicis to Warner Music to EMI have all started to sing 'future of 
media is mobile' stories. Publicis CEO Maurice Levy said that within a few 
years &quot;most of the music&quot;, &quot;most of the information&quot; and 
&quot;most of the advertising&quot; will &quot;transit through your cell 
phone.&quot;<br>
<br>
WEB AND ADVERTISING<br>
<br>
What of the internet? Good 
question. A few years ago there was a big battle of will the internet win or 
the mobile? Now it seems to be clear, it will be that the internet will 
converge onto the mobile. In fact, the future of the internet is mobile. Google 
CEO Eric Schmidt has been saying that for years already, and the new Google 
strategy,'Mobile First'&nbsp;is a clear indication of how seriously they are 
taking it. And Google are not alone among internet giants believing in a mobile 
future. From 2007, Yahoo has been saying the same. So if you thought that 
perhaps the internet was threatening your business, that may be a short-lived 
threat, say for industries already feeling the full threat like bookstores or 
video rentals or music stores or travel agencies etc. If the internet itself is 
headed to mobile, the salvation for a bookseller or video or music or travel 
company is not to go online, it is to 'leapfrog' the technology gap and go 
directly to mobile. Like the book publishing industry is doing in Japan for 
example where mobile books outsell ebooks already.<br>
<br>
Advertising goes 
where the media audiences go. Advertising has been on mobile phones for a 
decade already but in mostly small numbers and niche campaigns hidden in the 
digital ad budgets. That changed last year when the advertising industry woke 
up seriously to mobile. When the global ad budget declined, and all other forms 
of advertising shrunk in revenues, mobile advertising spending doubled 
worldwide. As I witnessed when I delivered my keynote to the Mobile Marketing 
Association global event in the meccha of advertising, Manhattan of the Mad Men 
of Madison Avenue haha, the big global ad agencies are all ramping up their 
competences in mobile, and I am witnessing it myself with far greater interest 
now in my mobile marketing workshops and seminars, such as delivering a keynote 
to the big MMA event in Sao Paulo this week. The global ad industry top 
management may be late to the mobile party, but they are dead serious about it 
now. As we learned from Universal McCann the advertising giant, one in seven 
media minutes is spent with mobile already today, as mobile is often the 
digital response channel for legacy media like television, radio, print etc. 
Voting for American Idol, that kind of experiences.<br>
<br>
WHAT OF MONEY<br>

<br>So the telecoms industry itself is migrating to mobile, no surprise anymore 
this late in the game. The computer industry is going mobile. The internet is 
going mobile too. And the major media industries and advertising are headed to 
a pocket near you too. But thats not the full picture. I have said for many 
years now, that we have yet another 'dimension' in this race, of a major 
economic sector headed to mobile: Money. In practise, its banking and credit 
cards when considering the classic major financial industries, or digital money 
in a technical sense (insurance is also going to join the mobile revolution a 
bit later). The first two SMS-enabled vending machines were installed in 
Finland twelve years ago, and soon thereafter the first SMS-enabled parking was 
launched in Norway. We've had full mobile payment solutions in the Philippines 
for a decade already. Mobile credit cards are nearly as old. But the migration 
of money is very slow. We hear of some great successes - more than half of 
Helsinki area public transportation single tickes are sold via mobile, and all 
of parking in Estonia is mobile, and now more than half of all banking accounts 
in Kenya are mobile banking accounts. But its still tiny bits in small 
countries. Yes, about half of South Koreans and the Japanese have mobile 
digital money enabled phones and services, but its nowhere near yet where half 
of their economy would transit the phone, and they are the most advanced 
digitally converged nations.<br>
<br>
In m-money it is very early going. 
Gartner told us that in 2009 there were 73 million people who used a mobile 
phone to make a payment. Informa counted that the world had&nbsp; 67 million 
people with a mobile banking account. Contrast that with the 2.1 Billion people 
with a banking account as reported by the BBC last year. If we want to measure 
the 'migration rate' then currently one third of one percent of all banking 
accounts have migrated to mobile. That is a very tiny fraction. But that was 
exactly how it was with smartphones vs personal computers in 2000, or how it 
was with the mobile internet users out of all internet users in 2002, or what 
it was with advetising in 2006. Less than one percent. Its easy for many in 
banking and credit cards to be fooled into thinking this tsunami wave of 
convergence will not hit their shores.<br>
<br>
Yet in South Africa it is 
normal to get your paycheck paid directly to your mobile account. Norway was 
the first country to let you submit your tax return by mobile. South Korea was 
the first country to make 'cards' out of Credit Cards optional - all credit 
card services are automatically enabled onto your mobile phone (instantly when 
the credit is approved), and if you want, a free plastic traditional credit 
card can be mailed in a few days also to your home address - if you so desire. 
There is no need for plastic cards in South Korea, but you may travel to a less 
advanced country like say Germany or USA or Australia or France where they 
'still use plastic credit cards' haha... In Japan the mobile wallet is the most 
advanced where it not just includes your banking and credit and payment and 
loyalty cards. It adds your keys to your home and car, the pass-keys to your 
office, your identity card, and now as the phone collects your payment 
behavior, they have launched the mobile consierge to the phone, to help manage 
your life. The users absolutely love it, suggesting the phone seems to read 
your mind..&nbsp; And taking those lessons, Nokia launched Nokia Money in India 
and is enabling near field to all its new smartphones.<br>
<br>
While the big 
banking execs are mostly blissfully ignorant, thinking that launching an iPhone 
App is tantamount to a mobile strategy, haha, the tsunami wave is well under 
way. So the migration has started. Sweden started this summer the first 
parliamentary discussions about when is the right time to abandon printing 
cash, and moving to a mobile money only digital money economy! They aren't 
about to do it any time soon, but they have started the serious discussion 
about the end of money as we knew it.<br>
<br>
That covers the giant industries 
I want to mention in this blog today. Telecoms, broadcast and print media, 
advertising, computers, the internet, banking, credit cards. These are all 
industries whose size is above 200 Billion dollars annually - ie each is bigger 
than the total global handset business including smartphones and dumbphones and 
all phone based accessories like spare batteries and phone covers and memory 
cards etc (combined, is worth about 160 billion dollars in total - a small 
fraction of the 1.1 Trillion dollar mobile telecoms industry where the majority 
of the revenues come from mobile services like voice, SMS and premium mobile 
data services).<br>
<br>
OTHER INDUSTRIES<br>
<br>
There are many more 
industries, more small ones, that also are impacted by mobile, like cameras, 
music, videogaming, the watches and clocks industry etc, but those are so small 
(all under 100 billion dollars in size) that I won't spend much time on them 
now. They were involved in the first mobile battle of convergence, what I 
called the 'Battle for the Pocket' in my second book M-Profits in 2002.<br>
<br>
There also are many other industries that are seeing impact from mobile, but 
who are unlikely to be totally cannibalized by mobile. So take air travel. 
Finnair launched the world's first mobile check-in in 2001 and today half of 
their passengers use the service. But mobile will not enable our air travel. We 
can't fly on the phone. We can book our seat and pay for the ticket and get a 
boarding pass to the phone, but we still need an airplane to burn jet fuel to 
fly from one airport to another. That isn't changing by mobile. So mobile can 
only influence a small part of the travel experience, whether in airplanes or 
hotels or trains etc. But in music, mobile can cannibalize all digital music. 
Same in the newsmedia or gaming or advertising or indeed money and banking and 
credit cards.<br>
<br>
So yes, the automobile industry is eager to get into 
mobile too, many new cars feature SIM card slots for example and the next 
internet (after the internet has gone mobile) will be in cars. But again, if we 
need a car to get us from point A to point B, until they invent teleportation, 
we will keep needing that car (or some rival like a bicycle or bus etc). Mobile 
cannot cannibalize the whole car market like it can't cannibalize the air 
travel market or the hotel industry etc.<br>
<br>
So this blog is about those 
industries that can expect far more than half of their total value, possibly 
the whole industry, to migrate to mobile in the coming years and decades. And 
that, if we take the dozen industries mentioned in this blog (excluding travel, 
cars, hotels etc) is worth a cool 5 Trillion dollars or about 9% of the total 
global economic spending of all economies on the planet.<br>
<br>
HOW FAR HAVE 
WE COME?<br>
<br>
So lets look a bit at how far we've migrated into mobile.<br>

<br>The telecoms industry is far along the way. 81% of the total telecoms 
industry has migrated from fixed landlines (0% in 1978) to mobile when counting 
total subscribers.<br>
<br>
The internet had 0% mobile users in 1996. At the 
end of last year we reached mid-point, where half of all internet users 
accessed the web at least part of the time using a mobile phone (which includes 
the simple WAP type of mobile internet usage common in many parts of the 
Emerging World markets). So the internet has migrated 50% in 13 years.<br>
<br>

Meanwhile there was no mobile phone that was a computer prior to 1997. There 
were stand-alone PDAs yes, but no advanced 'smartphone' to give computer like 
performance. Today all major PC makers have entered the smartphones battle and 
all say the future of the computer is the smartphone (something I have been 
saying for many years now). I counted on this blog that if we add both the 
traditional PCs including desktops and portable computers, and the smartphones, 
we get atotal market size of 465 million units for 2009. Smartphone accounted 
for 37% of that amount last year. So we can say that in 13 years, mobile has 
already cannibalized over a third of the computer market.<br>
<br>
Music was 
the first mobile content type in 1998 and today about 38% of all consumer music 
spending is mobile (when we include ringing tones). Videogaming followed and 
today a quarter of videogaming service revenues is generated on mobile. It 
would be an interesting market analysis to count all gaming-oriented 
smartphones (like the iPhone, most downloaded apps are games after all, the 
iPhone can be said to be the first globally successful gaming phone platform to 
rival the Nintendo and Playstation Portable..) and their value into the 
videogaming software value, the proportion would be bigger still.<br>
<br>
I 
don't have a good measure for wristwatches and alarm clocks. But sufficient to 
say that clearly more than half of consumer uses of telling time - and of the 
wake-up alarm - is now from the mobile phone.<br>
<br>
Of the big media 
industries like print, broadcast and the related advertising industries, their 
migration into mobile has only started and is in the low single digits in 
percent of total revenues or total content delivered. So these are all very 
early in the game.<br>
<br>
And like I said, Banking and Credit Cards are at 
far under one percent of total users (and far far less than that in total value 
of the transactions going through mobile).<br>
<br>
A LESSON<br>
<br>
But I 
want to end on the 'lesson' for this blog. Cameras. The camera industry boldly 
and bravely (and foolishly) thought mobile phone based cameraphones would never 
catch on, and never rival their industry. That was a short-lived battle that 
was over in only 3 years. Sharp and J-Phone of Japan launched the world's first 
cameraphone in 2000. By 2003, more cameraphones were sold globally than all 
stand-alone digital cameras. By the next year, cameraphones alone outsold all 
types of stand-alone cameras (digital and film-based). Today cameraphones 
outsell stand-alone cameras by 10 to 1.<br>
<br>
The camera industry correctly 
forecasted a dramatic growth in consumer adoption of digital cameras for this 
past decade. The growth was even better than they expected. But the growth was 
shifted from stand-alone digital cameras to cameraphones and the sales of 
stand-alone digital cameras stalled and stagnated. This is a common pattern in 
the 'Battle for the Pocket' as I have chronicled from the PDA vs Smartphone 
battle to the musicphone vs iPod battle, etc. Same pattern always. So what 
happened to the big four camera brands? In 2000 when the cameraphone was 
launched the world's biggest camera brands were&nbsp; Canon, Konica, Minolta 
and Nikon, all out of Japan. Today only two of them continue making cameras, 
Canon and Nikon - which both quickly shifted their focus from consumer snapshot 
cameras to premium professional and semi-pro camera systems. Minolta and Konica 
have quit the camera business altogether. This is the decade of the biggest 
growth of consumer camera use ever, where the annual market for new digital 
camera purchases grew by more than 10 fold. It was the golden age of cameras, 
yet two of the big 4 failed to survive this enormous opportunity.<br>
<br>
Same 
is true of the various other cameras-oriented industries like Kodak and 
Polaroid. The world's most sold camera brand is Nokia. The world's most sold 
branded camera optics are not Nikon or Canon branded lenses, they are Carl 
Zeiss optics, on many premium Nokia cameraphones. Of the total population on 
the planet, out of any person who has ever used any type of camera, for 9 out 
of 10 such users, the only type of camera they have ever used, is on some 
cameraphone. It may be difficult for older readers in the Western 
industrialized countries who see the long lines of cameras and accessories sold 
at the electronics stores, yet the numbers are perfectly clear.<br>
<br>
So 
lessons. The cameraphone did not kill the stand-alone camera. It just took 90% 
of the market. For the mobile industry that was far more than 'enough'. The big 
phone makers like Nokia, Samsung, SonyEricsson and LG are not in the business 
of creating professional cameras. They can happily leave the small 'pro market' 
to the specialists like Nikon and Canon. But as the mass market vanished, the 
mass market business also shifted. Kodak, Minolta, Polaroid, Konica and so many 
other major camera industry players had to abandon the camera related business 
and shift to something else like professional imaging or scientific 
instrumentation or photocopiers or whatever, or else go bankrupt - like 
Polaroid has done, twice already.<br>
<br>
If they had aggressively pursued the 
mobile market, either through a premium cameraphone or a specialist role in the 
ecosystem or in partnership - any of the big giants of cameras could have a 
major role in the mobile industry today. Look at Apple, a computer maker, who 
decided to do its music player (iPod) on a phone as the original featurephone 
iPhone 2G, and then decided to make it a full 'pocket computer' by the second 
release of the iPhone 3G as a real smartphone in 2008. They only sell 2% of the 
world's total mobile phone handset market today, but its such a huge market, 
that it powers the majority of Apple's revenues and the majority of Apple's 
profits.<br>
<br>
That is what Lenovo wants now, as they launched their LePhone 
and sold 100,000 units in the first quarter. Its not as good as Apple did in 
2007 but Lenovo is at least taking a stab at this market, rather than how the 
cameramakers hid their heads in the sand and tried to avoid the truth.<br>
<br>

I counted that in 2006 there were 7 of the Fortune Global 500 biggest companies 
on the plant, who made a smartphone. These were essentially the big phone 
makers like Nokia, Motorola, etc. At the start of 2010, there were 23 companies 
that had either launched or were launching a smartphone, out of the Fortune 
Global 500. That made the smartphone space one of the most competitive of any 
industries on the planet, with probably more global giant rivals than any other 
industry ever in the same space. (At least when it comes to banking, most banks 
tend to operate regionally or nationally, with only a few global banking 
brands).<br>
<br>
Note this growth was not that smaller 'newcomers' making 
smartphones had 'grown' into the Global 500. It meant that previous global 
giants of other industries had decided to enter the mobile space, like computer 
makers such as Apple and Dell, like internet giants like Google and Yahoo, like 
mobile operators/carriers like Vodafone and Hutchison, and softwre maker giant 
Microsoft etc. Obviously the year has not been kind in the over-competitive 
smartphones bloodbath (Google and Microsoft very visibly quit the smartphone 
handset business already, but both are increasing their software and services 
focus on mobile, so they have not abandoned the opportunity in digital 
convergence).<br>
<br>
WHAT DOES CONVERGENCE ENABLE<br>
<br>
Remember that 
converence gives us new opportunities of better experiences and as an industry, 
vast new opportunities. When you take a bookstore and put it online like 
Amazon, yes you can have some 'distribution' and 'warehousing' benefits and you 
can sell a larger catalog of book titles than the bricks-and-mortar bookstore 
down the street. But what of the reviews. What of my shopping history. What of 
others who liked that book. And personalized recommendations. Such abilities 
are impossible in traditional bookstores. In a small 'mom and pop' bookstore, 
if you were a loyal customer, you could perhaps gain the familiarity with the 
bookstore owner, to be able to get some recommendations. But that is rare and 
would take years of competence to develop by the bookstore owners, and still 
would not be nearly as powerful as the Amazon recommendation engine, in 
pinpointing exactly what kind of books I may like.<br>
<br>
Look at Google. 
Before search engines, it was not practical to try to find 'all available 
information' on a given topic, unless you lived next door to a major library 
like the US Library of Congress and were a wiz at using the library's card 
catalog system - and then spend hours digging through book indexes and tables 
of content. It would still not be as thorough as any Google search today, and 
it would take years to learn the skills and days of research in the library. 
Yet a child of 6 can do the same within a fraction of a second on Google today.
<br><br>
The digital convergence enables fantastic new services and abilites we 
never could have imagined. Take airline seats today. What travel agent could 
have specialized in Hong Kong to Sao Paulo travel for me today. What price 
ticket would I have gotten, on what airline combination, and what miserable 
layaways on the travel connections? Yet we can go to Expedia or Travelocity or 
Opodo whatever travel site you want to use, and get to see dozens of flight 
options - and their prices - and their routes - and the actual aircraft used. 
Then we have seat guru, which will tell me what in-flight electricity options 
are on that class of seat on that specific aircraft type on that particular 
airline. A paper based traditional travel agent would never ever have that 
capacity, except perhaps for the few 'domestic' airlines that serve their home 
town. But I see that instantly for all airlines. We get vastly superior 
services for consumers when we seek opportunties out of digital services. And 
this is all before we start to enable my flight itself with mobile check-in, or 
the hotel does a mobile phone enabled locks to my hotel room etc.<br>
<br>
WILL 
DISRUPT MORE THAN ENABLE<br>
<br>
But it also often means cannibalization of 
the legacy services and their eco-systems. So take music. At the end of the 
previous decade, the majority of music sales was through the sale of music CDs. 
Artists would compile 'albums' of about 15 songs, sold at a price far greater 
than the one hit that currently made the artist popular on the charts. A huge 
support system was in the recording industry to produce the sound of the music, 
to produce the CDs, to ship them to music retail stores, and to use the radio 
stations, music video TV stations like MTV, and promotional concert tours to 
help promote the album sales.<br>
<br>
Then came the internet, Napster, social 
networking, MySpace and YouTube. Almost all music became available on the net 
for free. The market changed drastically. The big music store chains started to 
fail and go out of business. The CD market shrunk sales year after year. But 
music didn't end. The market adjusted in two ways. The internet and digital 
enabled new ways for fans to discover their music and artists (MySpace, 
YouTube, social networking). Artists could still sell tickets at concerts, so 
they shifted more of their income from selling albums to concerts. And new 
digital formats emerged like the ringing tone and ringback tones, which now 
deliver a third of the total global consumer spending on music worldwide. The 
music industry was slow to get into this opportunity and there were many 
problems along the way - witness Crazy Frog. But consumers have not abandoned 
music. They still spend about 30 Billion dollars on it annually, only the 
traditional music publishing industry is getting an ever smaller slice of that.
<br><br>
So some skills are changed. The digital convergence brought powerful 
authoring and editing tools to any musician on their PC (and eventually 
increasingly also on their smartphone). That diminished - but did not eliminate 
- the role of the traditional music studio for creating music. Digital 
convergence changed music creation - the sampling of instruments popularized by 
the early 'synthesizer' music of the 1970s and 1980s has made it easier for an 
artist to 'master' multiple instruments. The mechanics of expert handling of a 
guitar or violin or piano is no longer as critical for the creation of music. 
It did not end the need for 'real musicians' ie playing at symphony orchestras 
etc, but it helped popularize music creation, by the masses, for the masses. 
Digital editing of sound has enabled errors in sound quality to be 'fixed' - ie 
some boy bands and girl bands may have members who don't have good singing 
voices (perhaps are better dancers or just pretty on stage ) that can be 
increasingly 'fixed' electronically. Again, that does not end the need for pure 
excellence in real singing - witness UK singing sensation Susan Boyle<br>
<br>

What the digital convergence did, most of all, it dis-intermediated some 
players, and re-intermediated others. The 'talent scout' at recording companies 
(The Big Labels) is a job that is disappearing. That is nothing new, once there 
was a huge need of typing skills at major offices, typing pools, before the 
word processor and email made most of their typing work redundant. There was 
once a need for staffs of receptionists to answer phones, but voice mail took 
most of those jobs. Etc etc etc<br>
<br>
We still have a need for real music 
and real musicians and real creative arists. The digital convergence may be 
making the difference between the average musician and superstar even greater - 
a Madonna or Rolling Stones can command astronomical fees, but the average 
starting rock band probably earns about the same per 'gig' per night, adjusted 
for inflation, as rock bands did in the time of the Beatles and Elvis 50 years 
ago.<br>
<br>
HOW BIG WILL IT BE<br>
<br>
I think we have enough evidence from 
early digital convergence to make some preliminary hypotheses.&nbsp; We can 
assume that the legacy businesses, that do not embrace the digital convergence, 
to survive as a premium professional services industry but eventually fail the 
mass market. Thus they cannot sustain the number of players they have today. 
But that likely digital convergence will not kill most industries. These will 
be tiny niche industries, but can be profitable and sell to very passionate 
specialist customers, and those who specialize within the remaining industry 
but manage to capture the premium end of that market, can make a nice living in 
it. These would by definition become very stagnant mature markets sustaining 
only a few players.<br>
<br>
A new converged economic opportunity emerges 
within the digital convergence which will not be as big, as the separate 
industries would be separately. So the cannibalization will eat into the size 
of the 'total pie' of the industries prior to convergence. But balanced against 
that shrinking of one pie, is the simultaneous growth of the total pie. So far 
up to now, the converged opportunity has always ended up far bigger than the 
initial industries that got into it.<br>
<br>
When the battle for the pocket 
started a decade ago, the total value of all pocketable digital gadgets was 
about 100 Billion dollars in very rough terms. By the time the mobile phone had 
beaten the major rivals, PDAs, stand-alone cameras and musicphones, by 2006, 
the total pocketable gadget market had doubled to more than 200 Billion dollars 
in value, of which mobile had about three quarters. But most of what makes a 
modern mobile phone valuable to consumers is not the PDA or camera or music 
abilities of it. There are far more abilies and functions and services that 
game as additional growth areas, like mobile internet or MMS picture messaging 
or mobile payments and banking, etc. Our phone today is far more than 'just' a 
PDA-camera-music-phone.<br>
<br>
The same happened in fixed-mobile convergence. 
The mobile did cannibalize some of the fixed telecoms revenues (and Skype 
probably took more of the fixed telecoms revenues than mobile) but today, the 
resulting combined telecoms industry is far bigger, about twice in size. Yet 
the opportunities did not come from just fixed telecoms services like local and 
long distance calls and voicemail, or those enabled on mobile. The mobile 
opportunity developed new abilities beyond convergence, starting from SMS and 
ringing tones more than a decade ago to augmented reality today.<br>
<br>
THE 
BIG PRIZE 5 TRILLION DOLLARS<br>
<br>
So that is what we are fighting for. The 
value of the different industries today headed for major cannibalization by 
mobile, where the majority of their business will end in mobile - is worth 5 
Trillion dollars. Mobile alone is worth a bit more than one fifth of that, so 
there is far more from 'outsiders' to 'contribute' to this journey, than for 
the legacy mobile giants to do<br>
<br>
It will be a big battle for this decade 
and for the banking and credit cards, that will last well into the next decade, 
but the convergence is inevitable. And do remember, this is not just about 
smartphone apps, or even about smartphones. Its about 'mobile' as the industry 
which is the ultimate convergence point and end-state for all digital 
convergence. That is what we are monitoring here on the Communities Dominate 
blog..<br>

<h2>July 29, 2010</h2> 
<h3>Another Casualty in Smartphone Bloodbath! Vodafone pulls plug on 360 
smartphones</h3> 
<p>I did suggest this would be a bloody year for smartphones but honestly I 
didn't expect this many casualties. Its only July and we've seen 4 deaths 
already. Palm (but re-birth via HP), Google Nexus One, Microsoft Kin and now 
Vodafone.<br>
<br>
Vodafone had earlier launched some cheap featurephones for 
emerging world markets like India. Then they announced Android based 
smartphones for their Vodafone 360 service environment. Now this week we heard 
that there won't be any Android smartphones on the Vodafone brand. Thats the 
4th major Smartphone player, and the third of Fortune Global 500 rivals to quit 
the smartphones race.<br>
<br>
Also this highlights how incredibly rare that 
success by Apple was with the launch of the iPhone and how exceptional - truly 
excellent - their entry was into the smartphones space. Notice that after 
'learning Apple lessons' giants like Google, Microsoft and Vodafone - have not 
been able to crack their way into this market.<br>
<br>
Its very very bloody in 
the smartphone wars. LG made losses with its phones business. Motorola reported 
a surprise profit in its handset division, but that was a one-time gain out of 
a lawsuit settlement with RIM. Without that money, Moto would have lost money 
again in its phones business. The competition is so tight that competitors are 
dropping like flies. And managements at very big global corporations do make 
investment decisions and product commitment decisions based on some very 
serious calculations. Google, Microsoft and now Vodafone have decided that the 
phones race is too costly to join (or to remain in). I think this suggests the 
times are so bad, that we will still see more casualties this year. Whose next 
to quit? Yahoo?</p>
