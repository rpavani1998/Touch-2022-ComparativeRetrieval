<h1> PC vs. Mac: Which is the Right One for You? </h1>

<p>Which is better, PC or Mac? </p> 
<p>The debate on whether what system is better has been going on for more than 
a decade now. Some have been arguing based on its features and specifications 
while many debates have been obscured by senseless personal attacks.</p> 
<p>Based on the arguments found in most online message boards, the 
long-lasting debate has been reduced to this: advocates of Windows PCs are 
ignorant and clueless about computers and their features, and Mac fans are 
elitists or social climbers.</p> <br>

<p>But looking at it objectively, not everyone who buys computing devices is 
incompetent in choosing or a member of a small group of rich brats. Consumers 
are smart. They know what they need and what is important to them.</p> 
<p>So for those people who want to do their research first before 
deciding&nbsp;what system to buy, read along to see where PCs and Macs stand.
</p> 
<h5>Cost</h5> 
<p>PCs are generally cheaper compared to Mac computers. You can buy a brand 
new fully set up desktop PC for more or less PhP 25,000.00. But iMacs are not 
available in that price range as the most affordable model costs around PhP 
55,000.</p> 
<p>Aside from the expensive Mac unit, its parts and services are also 
expensive. Macs have fewer proprietary parts and their internal drives are not 
user-replaceable. Mac&rsquo;s service and repairs can cost even beyond the 
unit&rsquo;s cost. So far, Apple&rsquo;s extended warranty, AppleCare 
Protection Plan, is the most expensive in the industry.</p> 
<h5>Selection</h5> 
<p>The best thing about Windows PCs is the variety of choices. They come in 
different designs, colors and sizes, and they differ in specifications and 
features. iMacs, however, come in few basic variants.</p> 
<h5>Design</h5> 
<p>Macs look more stylish and sleek than most PCs and thus, it appeals very 
much to the consumers who are looking for computers which are more modern and 
classy in appearance.</p> 
<h5>Operating System</h5> 
<p>A powerful argument in favor of buying Mac is its operating system. Unlike 
Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7, Mac&rsquo;s OS, OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, is 
more consistent, and less sluggish.</p> 
<h5>Security</h5> 
<p>Since majority of computer users use Windows, most of the known viruses, 
Trojans, and other malicious softwares and applications are designed to attack 
only Windows PCs. And even though there are now some virus attacks on Macs, 
they are still more secure [even without antivirus software] compared to a 
Windows PC that runs an antivirus program.</p> 
<p>Whether you are using an iMac or a Windows PC, all the basic features, such 
as the web, camera, software, printer, and other hardware, are fine in both 
systems. The only things that would really matter and greatly affect your 
decision are your needs, preference, and more importantly, your budget.</p> <em>
