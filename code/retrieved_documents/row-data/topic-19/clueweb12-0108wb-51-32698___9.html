<blockquote> Hey Mac users, I have been using PC's for 10 years(5 Pc's) every 
pc I have had I have had stupid problems here and there. I am a simple user, 
only emails, read articles on the web, watch DVD's and thats it. No games, no 
this or that, dont need hardly anything fancy. I have herd that Macs are easer 
to use with less problems. What is your guys take on this? I really think im 
going to give a Mac a try here soon, I just want a computer to work every time. 
Whats the pro's and cons for a simple user like me?<br>
<br>
 Thanks

<blockquote> well. I am a hard core PC fan, so i would tell you everything 
thats wrong with a mac but since your not a gamer, thats a different story.<br>

<br> PC pros&gt; Can run Games, supports a hell of a lot of hardware, can be 
upgrade if needed and software and controls 90% of the market. (if i am wrong, 
please correct me)<br>
 PC cons&gt; Can get a virus, can be hacked, can over 
heat and/or catch fire.<br>
<br>
 Mac Pros&gt; Greet at movie making, very easy 
to use if you only going on the web and checking e-mail and other websites like 
myspace. and theres almost now virus and haclers don't bother mac users<br>
 
Mac Cons&gt; Can crash randomly sometimes, If ya delete a important system 
file, your screwed. Not alot of programs work on it and your can't upgrade most 
macs if the need comes up.<br>
<br>
 this is from past incidents that have 
happen to me or friends of mine. I am still a PC fan and i don't think i will 
be getting a mac soon, even tho i think it be cool to have both a PC and a Mac

<blockquote> I'm totally into PC (10 years now already), I had to use Mac for 
a couple of times - I just cant get used to it, it so...not like PC. The 
biggest problem is the soft of course, what can you say when there is even no 
decent file manager for MAC (i mean like total commander), Finder just beats 
the &pound;%$ out of me Whats good about MAC is that when you buy one, you buy 
a computer that WORKS, you dont have to worry about anything. It's a good 
platform for development and designing as well, yet the PC is no worse i think..

<blockquote>  Whats good about MAC is that when you buy one, you buy a

<br> <br>
 Took perhaps 6 to 8 weeks to get used to my MAC, course I don't know 
it a well as I did Windows, but I don't need to.<br>
<br>
 Software support is 
getting better, its the small Windows apps that I do miss now and then, but 
actually you soon realise you don't really need them.<br>
<br>
 I'm sure both 
platforms will be around forever, and I guess that must be a good thing

 MACs until a few years 
ago were very hard to get help with and software too, but as people have stated 
it is getting better.<br>

 The MAC OS's are extremely reliable and for

<h2>  PC's are much better, esspecially security wise </h2> 
<blockquote> I have used both windows PC's, and mac's in the past and found 
that even a free antivirus installed on a windows PC is better than a mac OS, 
even with their own security systems. Their security systems are still 
identifying viruses by their name, size, icon, etc. Where windows and any 
security systems mainly built for windows uses MD5 signature identification. 
MD5 hashes are like fingerprints for programs, and cannot be hidden, changed, 
or misused in any way or form. This means the identifying, and deleting of the 
viruses is 100% effective and 120% more effective than a mac's security. I have 
tried and vigorously tested both and the PC is better. </blockquote>  Reply

 I reckon that tells it's own story. It might be 
that Mac users would be more likely to go to centres of knowledge that are 
geared to them. Most of us here may not have the large knowledge-base that 
exists on dedicated Mac forums. That could be a reason why Mac users wouldn't 
post here. Another reason for few Mac posts might be because of the percentage 
of MS Windows computers in use compared to Macs. More Windows users would mean 
more Windows-based posts I suppose. A visit to a Mac forum shows that Macs too 
can have their problems.</blockquote>

left alone like Macs probably are, Windows 7 just works. If you don't start 
trying to tweak or change this or that in W.7, it will run your games, word 
processors, spread sheets, art and photo programs or any other kind of software 
you want to install.<br>
<br>
 This has been my experience with various MS 
operating systems and not just Windows 7. I might have learned a few things 
about browsers, the OS and other programs out of interest. Mostly though, I've 
looked after the security and then just got on and run the installed programs. 
How is that different to a Mac? It seems to me that by going to a Mac, you end 
up with a different breed of computer but not necessarily one that will run 
programs any better.</blockquote>

<blockquote> We use PC's in our office, and I have been a PC user for well 
over 2 decades!<br>
<br>
 Recently an iMac was thrust upon us by the boss! I 
have used it a few times, and quite like it.<br>
<br>
 I must admit that as 
soon as I get a bit stuck, I run to my laptop!<br>
<br>
 But a few things can 
help the switch, I find...<br>
<br>
 Enabling the right click for a start! <br>

<br> In terms of pros vs. cons, this is what I find (although it's just my 
opinion!):<br>
<br>
 * Pretty quick boot time <br>
 * Less malware or viruses 
(or should that be Virii?!)<br>
 * Looks neat! hahaha <br>
 * Screens are high 
quality on iMac I feel, similar to iPhones I guess! Kinda solid feeling<br>
 * 
If you use Linux at all, the command line stuff on Mac is very similar, due to 
being Unix based (I believe, although tech guys, correct me if I am wrong!)<br>

 * Once you get used to them, they work really well, less clunky than many PCs
<br> * As (again, I believe, but may be wrong) all the hardware is designed by 
Apple, it all just 'works' together much better, whereas with a PC, the 
mainboard may be from one company, graphics card another... soundcard a 
different one still, etc... Not necessarily all totally compatible).<br>
<br>

<br> Cons... <br>
<br>
 * Some specialist programmes may not be available on 
Macs<br>
 * Repairs may cost more... or at least harder to 'user repair' or 
'user upgrade'<br>
 * The OS is a bit different, and will take some getting 
used to<br>
<b>* Perhaps the worst Con, is you will have to admit to all your 
PC mates that you have joined 'The Other Side' !!!<br>
<br>
</b>&#8203;Hope 
that helps!</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>
