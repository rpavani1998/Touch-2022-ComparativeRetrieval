<h2>  Apple's Unfixable Gadgets...Made to Break? </h2>  Written by Hank Green 
on 19/01/08 <br>

<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For a while now I've been in communication with Brett Mosley, the guy who 
started &quot;BuyMyTronics.com.&quot; Brett's a huge EcoGeek...he basically 
buys broken electronics, fixes them, and then sells them on EBay. It's like 
recycling, but way better, because the gadgets get to keep living. He's 
recently expanded his business to cover iPhones, Zunes, and gaming systems, and 
is about to expand even further into cell phones and laptops.</p> 
<p>But Brett is upset, and that makes me upset. Apparently, the sixth 
generation iPods and the current iPod Nano have been designed to be 100% 
unfixable. According to Brett,</p> 
<blockquote> The new generations of iPods and the iPhone are not designed to 
be opened. Because the Nano, iPhone and generation 6 &quot;Classic&quot; bodies 
are metal to metal the body gets completely trashed upon opening.In the Nanos 
and Shuffles, parts are actually soldered together, eliminating the 
possiblility of simple repair. So, for me, it will be harder to fix these, 
increasing repair costs and diminishing their resale value after they have been 
repaired. </blockquote> 
<p>All of this kinda flies in the face of Apple's new green image. So I 
thought maybe they were just trying to get people to send them back to Apple 
for proprietary repairs. I asked Brett if Apple maybe had special tools that 
allowed the to repair these metal-to-metal devices:</p> 
<blockquote> Besides charging you hundreds to fix it (which makes it more 
economical for most to just get a new one) they probably have to give it a 
whole new body whenever they open one. I don&rsquo;t know how they could make a 
repair without trashing the body.</blockquote> 
<p>Kinda the opposite of green there. We need to hear more from Apple, 
obviously, but it's hard to imagine, in the midst of their &quot;green-up&quot; 
why Apple would switch to bodies that are impossible to open for repairs. 
Brett's answer: &quot;Looks...Pure Looks.&quot; And as Apple has always been 
known, and commended, for its design, this doesn't seem too hard to accept. He 
also surmises that they might be trying to discourage the market in repairs and 
mods that fuel his and many other businesses.</p> 
<p>But it comes down to the fact that, when choosing between extending the 
life of their gadgets and making things look pretty, Apple is landing on the 
side of pretty.</p> 
<blockquote> Making these models more difficult to repair is invariably 
un-green in the long run. By reducing their future re-use, value and lifespan, 
Apple is basically saying, &quot;These gadgets are no use after two years, so 
send them back to us for recycling, and buy a new one.&quot;</blockquote> <br>

It would be good to hear what Apple have <br>

 about their official line is on this. <br>
I 
know a number of people who buy Apple products because the products always 
break within the first 6 months and they're then given a new one.<br>
Is it 
just me that suspects Apple has one of the largest return rates of all the 
manufacturers of notebooks as well as mp3 players.<br>
I'd like to hear what 
Apple are doing with all the returns they get - I hope they're not ending up in 
China...

 It 
sounds to me like there might be potential in after-market/post-repair cases 
for these devices.<br>
They wouldn't be perfect, but they would be usable.

 The 
iPhone and iPod are not soldered together and can be disassembled without 
damaging the devices. Do a Google search for &quot;iPhone disassemble&quot; and 
there are instructions and videos with the details.

 They 
can be taken apart, but it is pretty much impossible to do it without damaging 
the case, this is alluded to in every disassembly discussion I've seen.<br>
<br>
So:<br>
1. Apple is forcing people into using their extremely expensive repair 
services, which often make buying a new device cheaper.<br>
<br>
And <br>
2. 
They are likely replacing the case in every repair job they actually do.

 Bummer! Will these discarded iPhones end up in a smoldering heap in 
Ghana or China or India, like most broken cellphones and tvs and computers? 
National Geographic story on e-waste says even the places that claim they will 
recycle your electronics safely often export them to developing countries which 
use unsafe methods to extract valuable metals from them:<br>

 Any Apple things I or my family owns are pleasantly repairable, more or 
less... though my sister's old iPod mini did sit around dead for ages until she 
traded it up for a new nano--quite unrepairable, I'd imagine. I admire the 
design from afar, but I'm just unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary for 
it--personally and environmentally. I just wish people would consider the long 
term savings of green more! and that other suppliers and designers would follow 
apple some more sometimes : )<br>
<br>
love my xps m1330 though!

 following the hint given by ces, within a few seconds I found a video showing 
how to disassemble an iPhone. Unless this video is an elaborate hoax, it shows 
that the device can indeed be taken apart without damaging any of its 
components. Please do some more research in the future before publishing 
defamatory statements about things that you believe, but do not know for 
certain.

written by angelo, January 22, 2008 <br>

 Everyone I know has a broken ipod. Apple owners are so protective of apple. 
They are secretive about all of the little breakdowns and replaced mice and 
software upgrade incompatibility and expired file permissions. A 1000 dollar 
mac from 2002 is worthless. A 1000 dollar home made pc from 2002 is running 
strong.

iPhone Disassembly <br>
written by Hank, January 22, 2008
<br>  Instructables has a video of a disassembled iPhone, what they don't have 
is the video of the disassembling process...<br>
<br>
That's because, in order 
to take the back cover off the iPhone, you have to spend many minutes 
delicately prying the metal slab up. The result is, generally, a lot of wasted 
time and a slightly dented iPhone panel. The damage is cosmetic, but 
significantly decreases resale value, and be unacceptable to people seeking 
repairs.<br>
<br>
That's the iPhone, the Nano is actually physically impossible 
to take apart without ripping solders.

Re: protective <br>
written by Pete, January 22, 2008 
<br>  This comment is utter tosh. In my family we have 4 iPod which are used a 
lot and have never missed a beat in two years. I have a couple of pre 2000 macs 
that are still running fine and one of them even runs Tiger. A 1000 dollar iMac 
will still run quite happily. OK it may not be worth a lot now but your home 
made PC, although still running, will be equally worthless - unless you are 
talking about the box having a load of upgraded parts in it but then that isn't 
the same machine you started with.<br>
<br>
Why do numbskulls have to 
perpetuate the Mac/Pc war? Angelo, It's long over, you can come out of your 
bunker now. Most people realise that computers are like cars - you buy what you 
like and what works for you. Ridiculous comments doing down the opposition are 
for kids.

There is a good site for those not 
wanting to perpetuate apple's stranglehold on media players. It has some useful 
tools on it that allow you to choose a media player by comparing all of the 
features.<br>
<br>
I am not an apple basher. I actually like the fact that they 
are giving ms a little competition. I just think that some of their equipment 
is less then spectacular. For example:I wouldn't by an mp3 player that you 
couldn't easily replace the battery. That is one of the ways to sort all of the 
equipment on this site.

 Apple 
owners, there is no need to be so protective. You get what you paid for; an 
awesome ad campaign and pretty design. Here is a summary of the Apple products 
I see around me.<br>
<strong>Girlfriends ipod:</strong> 1.5 years old. Battery 
won't charge.<br>
<strong>her sisters ipod:</strong> less than one year old, 
battery lasts 20 minutes.<br>
<strong>her other sister's ipod:</strong> Utterly 
stopped working.<br>
<strong>my friends ipod:</strong> wont let him transfer 
certain music from his computer.<br>
<strong>girlfriend's 2002 imac:</strong> 
cost $1000 dollars and is worthless. No dvd drive means can't install newer OS, 
Old OS is utterly incompatible. Mouse failed after a year. Apple stopped making 
the airport card for it. NO resale value. It is rotting in the garage as we 
speak. This is all to say nothing of the fact that is underperformed similarlly 
priced PCs from day 1. Their service sucked and was expensive. Genius bar was 
always packed (for some strange reason).<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, my home built PC 
(2.4 ghz, 1gbram, 80gb hard drive) ($500) still kicks ass. Took me less than an 
hour to assemble. Absolute cake.<br>
<br>
Pete is right. There is no Mac vs. PC 
war because there is no company called &quot;PC&quot;. Just one greedy, sneaky 
company called Apple. Apple has been ripping people off for years. That is how 
they supplement income from good products. Every company does it. It does not 
mean you are stupid for buying their products, just that Apples ad execs are 
doing their job. Also, I should say that my friend's dual g4 is still an 
awesome computer after 5 years, it is just that it cost 3000 new, and my $500 
PC is still better. But thanks to Apple's greed, I cannot run final cut on my 
computer because they only let their computers run it.<br>

iPod repairs <br>
written by anechoic, January 22, 2008 
<br>  I took my laptop to monkeys at the Apple 'Genius Bar' (I use the term 
genius very loosely in this case)...while waiting I saw 10 people all bringing 
their iPods in for some reason or another. Only one other laptop made it to the 
Genius Bar during my visit.<br>
<br>
I swore from that day forward to only ever 
buy a Linux-based media player.

Warranty <br>
written by brainiac, January 23, 2008 <br>

 All you really have to do is buy the warranty on any apple product. Is it 
really that hard to figure out? And another thing... apple products are not 
meant to be taken apart. If they wanted you to take it apart then there would 
be instructions, and a little button that says open. No fence, but even if they 
did put an open button people wouldn't know what to do with it.<br>
<br>
BTW... 
if you want an appointment at the Apple &quot;Genius Bar&quot; you need to 
actually make one. I agree that the people there are idiots, but most people 
bringing their laptops are idiots!<br>
<br>
And another thing! I have been 
through 5 different types of PC's in the last three years ranging from gateways 
to sonys, and they all result in the same thing... useless computers that need 
to be restarted every time I open up word, or want to print a file online. 
Seriously... all computers suck, and Vista makes my NEW PC run ten times as 
slow. My point is not all problems with macs are just mac problems... angelo! 
Oh and next time angelo... check your facts with others, not just your bubble 
of friends!

Warranty? <br>
written by Ashley, January 23, 2008 <br>
 
Are you serious brainiac? I bought my creative labs Zen Touch over 4 years ago 
and it's still running stronger than any IPod I've come across.<br>
<br>
Plus, 
if you're going to assume the appointment of genius tech wiz... i don't suggest 
mentioning you've been through 5 computers in 3 years and still haven't figured 
out how to modify/speed them up or that you run Vista (as I'd assume most 
computer literate people have been wary about the OS jump OR have moved on to 
more open source options)<br>
<br>
But most importantly, the ultimate point of 
the article was to show that modifications CAN'T be made, and therefore can't 
be recycled, so buying a Warranty with Apple is essentially perpetuating the 
problem... am I wrong?<br>
<br>
I think it's sad, and I've also referred a 
bunch more of my friends to the refurbished gadgets site... GOOD GOING! I wish 
I was smart/knowledgable enough to do it myself : )

 Ever since the good old days of Apple II, they have 
changed their strategy to something that is not for us, to touch. Apple 
products are not designed to be modified and they are doing everything they can 
to prevent the user from doing so.<br>
<br>
that was one of the main reasons I 
stopped buying apple and went and bought a taiwanese made PC instead.<br>
<br>

So goes with the new &quot;generation&quot; of apple products, it is the same 
crap, different marketing.

michael chen, January 23, 2008 <br>
 Uh.. i have a powerbook G4 from 2003. I 
also have a toshiba satellite laptop with from 2006. A sony laptop from 2001. 
In all cases with the windows pc laptops... they all crash within the first 3 
days of use... mind you i bought them brand new. The sony was bought from the 
sony metreon back when i was in SF. The toshiba here in london. I bought the 
mac in taiwan. After all these years, the PB with 1.25ghz is still going strong 
and have never broken down on me. Despite having a need for a pc all the time 
(i use CAD and SolidWORKS)... i always find myself using my old powerbook at 
the end of the day to finalize my work. I also have a Dell desktop bought in 
early 2007. Atleast only crashed 4 or 5 times. I have to be so careful with 
pcs... the toshiba was a waste of money... damn thing takes 15 minutes to 
start. I have reinstalled the windows OS two times since buying it. In my 
experience so far. Being the owner of so many goddamn computers... Apple 
computers as a whole have only failed me on a few memorable occasions.<br>
#1) 
In highschool it completely died on me while i was writing my term paper. Never 
knew the cause.<br>
#2) while operating photoshop, illustrator, ms word, as 
well as firefox- the system froze (rainbow wheel) for a good ten minutes...I 
had to unplug the batt and powercord. (i was also using Azureus to DLing movies)
<br>Thats it... But for PCs... geez... it is like buying a car that needs your 
most undivided attention (all the time). It gets tiring trying to maintain 
them... I dont want to do that. That is their job. That is why i pay money for 
machines to help me do my work... not the other way around.<br>
PC repairs 7 so 
far (fingers crossed). I have yet to take my 5 year old mac to the stupid bar. 
Now how many strictly pc users leave their pcs on for 5-6 weeks straight at a 
time like i do with my mac...not many.<br>
I am not saying that pcs are all 
bad.... but i might just have the worst luck with them.

If you don't own gadgets like 
this you do not have to get them fixed, recycled, maintained. You save money, 
create less pollution, use fewer resources. And best of all you do not 
encourage the production of more crap.<br>

 Girlfriends iMac: no DVD. Start up in target mode, do software 
install from another Mac. Works fine, I do this for a laptop with a broken DVD. 
(Also, the existence of a new OS does not diminish your old one in any way.)<br>
<br>iPod Batteries: All battery technologies used in portable electronics are 
consumable. Every electron you push in and pull back out diminishes the 
capacity a bit. When you wear the battery out to the point it doesn't last long 
enough for your replace the battery. If you aren't comfortable doing it 
yourself then google 'ipod battery replacement', look at the paid spots at the 
top of the page and fix it. The service is cheap. For example, a gen2 nano 
which requires soldering is $5 to have them do the swap plus the $20 for the 
battery.

 Why does every comment forum about anything 
apple-related spiral downward into a stupid pro vs. anti mac war? JUST TALK 
ABOUT THE FACTS!!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I work at an electronics repair shop, and we 
repair lots of gadgets, including iPhones and Nanos... The iPhone is simple to 
open up (I have no idea what this article is talking about) -- the nano is a 
bit more tough. We still do it, however, it just takes more time. I've also 
witnessed the same process at an apple store, so I can assure you they can open 
up both of these products without damaging the back plate.<br>
<br>
I agree 
that the new Zune is much easier to open and repair, but that's largely due to 
its plastic shell, which isn't readily recyclable like the iPod/iPhone's 
aluminum anyway, and can occasionally crack... each has it's ups and downs on 
case manufacturing.<br>
<br>
And to everyone's point: we'll replace your iPhone 
battery for $30. No new case required.<br>
<br>
FYI, iPhone disassembly video 
that describes the process... They don't show how to pop off the black case at 
the bottom, which is the most time consuming process, but it's good:<br>
<br>

Final word: I 
have repaired literally hundreds of music players, and I don't believe I've 
ever damaged a case, iPhone, iPod Nano, or Zune. This story smells fishy.

Apple Product Fixability <br>

 I own 1 Ipod Nano, 1 Ipod Touch , 5 Macs (including some 
old vintage collector laptop models that still work perfectly to this day) and 
an iPhone. I can easily open all of them without damage to upgrade RAM, HDs or 
change batteries--it's easy to find the simple tools needed and 
&quot;how-to&quot; explanations or videos on the opening process. Google, as 
always, is your best friend here. I also own 5 PC laptops which are also 
relatively easy to open and upgrade (though not nearly as easy as the Macs).<br>
<br>I think everyone is missing the real issue though. This is not a Mac vs PC 
issue. The big picture is<br>
<br>
<strong>&quot;how to properly dispose of or 
re-cycle electronic gadgets&quot;</strong>. <br>
<br>
All manufactures should, 
in their own best interests (Read the Great Book &quot;Green to Gold&quot;), 
prominently describe to their customers how to do this easily and effectively. 
Apple's website displays on it's main page, bottom center, how to re-cycle
<strong><em>any </em></strong>MP3, computer or mobile phone <strong>for free
</strong>. <br>
<br>
Universal awareness of gadget re-cycling is more important 
than petty Mac vs PC kaka.<br>

Ipod or Zune ? <br>
written by Leonard, January 26, 2008 
<br>  There have been many pro and con comments on this thread about the Ipod 
and the Zune, Mac vs PC etc.. I am neutral in the these wars. I own many 
products of each type. I appreciate and admire quality wherever I find it. I 
also hate poor workmanship whenever consumers are the victim of such. I think 
Microsoft is a great, great<strong><em>software </em></strong>company that 
continues to excel most of the time (Vista is the notable exception) with its 
software products--see the brilliant Ribbon Interface in Office 2007, one of 
the best new software products of our time or ever. However, as much as I like 
the software company, Microsoft has a long established history of poor quality 
workmanship in its<em><strong>hardware </strong></em>division--just Google the 
many thousands of painful real life reports associated with the XBOX and the 
original Zune. The XBOX, including the 360, is a case history of how<em><strong>
not</strong></em>to make a consumer product. Think of how many non-functioning 
XBOXes populate the land fills in the USA. Ditto for the original Zune. This 
reputation has been deservedly earned over years of producing poorly designed 
low quality units. Apple, on the other hand, along with Sony, Panasonic, 
Pioneer, Toyota, Honda, John Deere and Caterpillar, have all earned well 
established reputations for producing high quality<strong><em>hard good </em>
</strong>products because of well thought out designs and first class quality 
control systems.<br>
<br>
Food for thought for anyone considering a Microsoft 
<em><strong>hardware </strong></em>product.

 I agree with Leonard, as I am also &quot;bi-platform&quot; and I 
think the whole brand loyalty to the point of cultish identification with your 
products is pretty stupid (and kind of creepy, when you think about it!) They 
are just machines, and we love them when they do our bidding, hate them when 
they refuse, or break. I think the problems of durability, usability over the 
long haul, repairability and upgradability have been seen industry-wide. OTOH, 
how many old PCs of the vintage of my still-working old Macs have I seen out 
there? Not many. Of course build-it-yourself geeks out there can upgrade and 
repair and do all sorts of fun stuff like overclocking and the like, but we are 
talking about typical consumer wares here. Even self-built computers have a 
shelf life - hard disks die, fans fail, upgrades are needed. That said, I do 
like Apple products, or business class HP...<br>
<br>
My favorite Apple laptop 
was the Titanium - I LOVED the easily removed keyboard so I could clean out 
stray crumbs and dust, and also access the innards. I loved how easy it was to 
take apart and upgrade or fix - I put a new hard drive in it myself, and of 
course, stuff like memory was easy. It seems they've been making it harder and 
harder for do it yourselfers. I really wish they'd bring back that keyboard - 
way better than compressed air. (and less waste, too.)<br>
<br>
It seems the 
nature of the computer business to make your older models obsolete with newer 
models - different memory configuration so you can never use your extra memory 
in your new machine, different everything. And they keep making new software 
that is better and better in some ways, but if you keep your old machines 
running, after a while, you can't run any of it any more. (I've seen the 
&quot;Story of Stuff&quot; video mentioned previously, and it really fits with 
the computer industry, especially).<br>
<br>
I kept, for the longest time, a 
copy of Wordperfect 1.0 - on a small floppy disk (remember those?) with all my 
files on there, too! Can you imagine? And you know what? It still did most of 
what you &quot;need&quot; a word processing program to do today.<br>
<br>
I've 
been able to pass my old computers, including the ancient little classic Mac I 
started with, on to folks who can use them - Freecycle is great for that! I 
gave Titania (my old TiBook) to a friend who needed it and she LOVES it. Now 
I'm thinking of getting a new MacBook, since mine is a PowerBook... I shouldn't 
give in, but I want the 250GB hard drive! I don't own a desktop computer, so my 
laptop has to substitute for one. Which is why I won't be getting the new 
&quot;Air.&quot;<br>
<br>
Long-lasting, durable, upgradable, and fixable are 
just as, maybe more important than recyclable. All the energy of production and 
transport and packaging contributes to how &quot;green&quot; a product is - a 
less recyclable machine with a longer &quot;shelf life&quot; and more 
accessible repairs and upgrades would, in the end, be much greener than a 
&quot;merely&quot; recyclable machine.<br>
<br>
Maybe someday... :- <br>

now they make it so that if it does die on you, you can't get a simple repair?

 If you believe apple is made up of earth loving 
people who want to save the planet more than they want to make a bunch of money 
you're nuts. If there wasn't this whole &quot;green&quot; buzzword and image 
branding opportunity for them they wouldn't give a hoot about it. It just 
happens to fit with their whole &quot;wow were so unique and hip and cool and 
fresh&quot; image. Obviously they want ipods to be disposable things that go 
bad and need to be replaced, there's no money in something that lasts forever 
and can be repaired by anyone, that doesn't generate any revenue for them.

Apple Truths <br>
written by Jeff, August 21, 2008 <br>
 
I have owned more than 10 PC's (own a small business) and now 2 apples plus 5 
ipods. I can tell you that both apple laptops have totally crashed and needed 
repair...one of them twice. 2 of 5 iPods have broken though more due to 
negligence than anything else. The 10 PC's have really never broken ALTHOUGH 
they all virtually become unusable due to Microsoft and all of it's 
sloppy/junky programming. The dream is PC quality with an apple OS.<br>
<br>
As 
much as I LOVE my MacBook Pro, I'd have to recommend a PC. It slows down and 
breaks over time but in my experience it has never completely broken on me.

 @Jeff: Your PCs may be doing well, but that doesn't 
mean that PCs in general are perfect. My friend's Toshiba Satellite laptop has 
been in the repair shop almost constantly for about a year now. We got it back 
a couple of weeks ago and it kept dying due to a loose power connection (we 
think). It died about every ten minutes. Remember that it has been undergoing 
repairs for quite a while, and some of the best computer experts in the city 
have looked at it.<br>
<br>
@Jack: Remember that Apple &quot;led the 
industry&quot; (their words) in environmental matters. They switched to green 
technologies well before they were regulated. Apple phased out lead in 
plastics, paints, and packaging long before RoHS came into effect. Their 
products are designed with recycling in mind. The aluminium and glass used in 
the iMac, MacBook, and MacBook Pro are highly recyclable.<br>
<br>
@Free iPod 
Touch: Apple offers extended warranties for all of its products.<br>
<br>

@NatureGeek: I agree that locking oneself to a particular manufacturer is 
strange. I use Macs at home, Dell PCs with WinXP at school, and I have some 
extra PCs at home. I got them from the school when they upgraded. I have Ubuntu 
installed on one, but I haven't gotten around to hooking it up to the network 
yet because my other computers serve me just fine. My iPod is a 4th Generation 
Classic, from July 2004. It still works just fine, and the battery lasts long 
enough.<br>
<br>
@Angelo: You do realize that Macs come with software, and for 
PCs it usually costs extra unless it would be free anyway (e.g. Dell shipping 
PCs with Ubuntu). About Final Cut, you should try porting a piece of software 
that complex to another operating system. If you really want to run it on your 
PC, just install Mac OS X. I don't think someone like you would do enough 
research to have heard of this, so yes, it is possible. You can use something 
called a search engine, e.g. Google, to find it. There's probably a little bar 
in the top right of your browser with the word &quot;Google&quot; in it. Type 
what you want to know about in there.<br>
About that iMac, you could probably 
turn it into a wired network server. Install Linux if you want.

 I fix 
iPods for extra money and I have found that the only ones that are difficult to 
fix are the nanos, do to the size and almost everything being soldered to the 
board itself. As far as taking them apart, the first one of a model I take 
apart I will break, after that they are easy.

I'm Laughing my Rear Off! <br>
written by Christopher 
Whaley, November 23, 2008 <br>
 I'm laughing hard, very hard, I think my OJ is 
coming out of my nose. Wow.<br>
<br>
I'm not a fan boy of either camp. I did 
however read ALL the comments.<br>
<br>
To the guy who says his $1000 iMac is 
worthless after a few years, tell that to the G3 iMac running Tiger (yes Tiger, 
grow a brain non believers). It sits on my garage, plays music, and my iPhone 
is its remote. Rain, or snow, it always runs. Its 20F here, and it still runs, 
my car needs work, and thanks to the G3 I will have it done, while listening to 
the latest Tool album.<br>
<br>
To the whomever says the iPhone isn't 
repairable. I have reapired several. Its not my fault or Apples fault that the 
average Jackass can't use a $10 15W iron from radio shack and replace a 
battery. I have replaced displays, digitizers, and batterys in several iPhones. 
Never have I damaged the AU case, maybe the Ant cover, but thats a cheap part.
<br> <br>
Regarding the new MacBook and &quot;Being just as sturdy as the 
plastic MacBook&quot;. You sir, are a retard, a handicapped child. I have had 
my Macbook replaced several times for the cracked plastic case, thats why I now 
have the all Aluminum MacBook, and all it cost me was the gas to get to the 
Apple store. You can argue that a &quot;PC&quot; would not have the done the 
same, and you are probably right. None of my Gatewas/Dell/Compaq/HP/SOny (and I 
have had them all) laptops have cracked. But what if they had? I would have had 
a mail in repair, that lasted WEEKS. Not only that, but they replaced my OUT OF 
WARRANTY MacBook with the new model.<br>
<br>
So my point is, customer service, 
customer service, Apple has it aplenty. Call and Apple store and speak to one 
of the 6-8 managers they have next time you have a problem.<br>
<br>
This being 
said, I'm not a &quot;FanBoy&quot; either way. Just very happy with my Apple 
products. I will always own a MacBook for Travel, and a windows PC for gaming. 
As a matter of fact I am typing this on my &quot;Hackint0sh&quot;. A 
&quot;Black Friday&quot;, $299 Compaq, with upgraded ram and video card, 
running OSX, and yes, I have purchased a copy of leopard for this machine. And 
yes it does run nearly as fast as my MacBook.<br>

<br>  I went to a school where every student received a mac on entering. I 
myself have had several macs over the years as well as a couple of Ipods.<br>

The thing is Apple is a company that both makes it's computers and it's OS. 
PC's are made by many different companies and quality ranges from one to the 
next. In all my experience with apple products, Apple has almost repeatedly 
shown it's self to choose &quot;looks&quot; over quality of material. Mac OS is 
a great operating system, but Apples hardware to match is another story. With 
Apple you usually can't build your own or even can't upgrade your equipment 
then run Mac OS. That's what makes me dislike apple. They are very controlling 
in a lot of ways. Far from the free spirit image they project. If you could 
match up the hardware of the PC with the Mac OS it would be great, but apple 
won't have that.
