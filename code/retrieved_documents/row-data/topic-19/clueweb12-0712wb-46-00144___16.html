jfruhlinger writes <i>&quot;I'm a Mac guy. When our 2004-era Windows XP laptop, 
which was used primarily by my wife, died last summer, I got myself a new 
MacBook Pro and she inherited my still serviceable 2008 MacBook. But after 
about six months, she hasn't gotten used to it, and wants a Windows machine. I 
don't have an ideological problem with this &mdash; it'd be her computer, and 
we've got a bit of money stashed away to pay for it. But trying to pick one out 
is my job, and I find the the whole process bewildering. Apple's product 
differentiation is great at defeatingthe paradox of choice &mdash; you have a 
few base models, the difference between which is quite obvious, and you can 
customize each. The Windows world seems totally different. Even once I've 
settled on a vendor for a Windows laptop (something I haven't done yet), each 
seems to have a bewildering array of product lines with similar specs. Often 
models that you find in electronics or office supply stores that seem promising 
in terms of form factor are exclusive to those stores and can't be found 
online. Obviously people do navigate this process, but I'm just feeling out of 
my depth. How would Slashdotters go about picking a solid, basic laptop for Web 
surfing and document editing that won't be obsolete in two years?&quot;</i>

<p>Is that system builder licenses aren't transferable. It is 100% fine to use 
them on systems you do yourself, that's why Newegg sells them. However they are 
designed like OEM licenses that Dell et al sell which means that they are tied 
to that system, which in this case means a motherboard. So you install it, and 
life is good. However if you get a new computer later and want to transfer it, 
no deal, it is tied to the computer you put it on.</p> 
<p>That's more or less what you are paying for with retail Windows is a 
&quot;transfer tax&quot; if you like, or having the license be like a book. You 
can only have it on one thing, but you are free to change what that thing is.
</p> 
<p>I'm not saying that is a big deal, just that it is something to know and

<p>Unless something has changed recently, that's not entirely true. An OEM 
disc which comes bundled with a computer frequently has 2 keys available, one 
is on the disc and is valid for any number of computers as a part of the OEM 
computers and the one which is stuck to the side for that particular computer.
</p> 
<p>I've used OEM discs on upgraded computers many times and as long as you use 
the computer specific one on only one computer at a time you're fine. From time 
to time if you upgrade too quickly it will refuse to activate, but if you let 
it set for a period of time it'll install just fine. Otherwise you have to call 
MS for them to clear the previous install.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook

disable the touch-to-click on trackpads, because I'll be typing and some part 
of one of my hands will hit the trackpad and the cursor jumps somewhere or

The newer Mac laptops replaced that second Enter with another alt key.<br>
 Fn 
+ up arrow = page up, Fn + down arrow = page down<br>
 The swapping of the meta 
keys makes sense because the primary meta key you use is Command on the Mac.<br>
 Don't really see what's wrong with more meta keys on the opposite side of the 
keyboard. My think pad has more than one Ctrl and Alt. Considering that Command 
is the Mac equivalent of Ctrl it's exactly equivalent. Except my thinkpad has 
that silly menu key.<br>
 And virtually every PC has a hard eject button on the 
drive. So what?<br>
 Yup Delete is Backspace and if you want forward delete 
hold Fn+Delete.<br>

 I think if you actually bothered to learn how to use 
your Mac laptops keyboard you'd like it a lot better. Parent Share twitter

<p>Actually it's about the worst answer.<br>
<br>
 1. the laptop is 2.5 years 
old. The battery will be almost gone and there will likely be other HW issues 
developing.<br>
<br>
 2. the wife does not like it.<br>

 I can tell that 
everyone suggesting you just put Windows on the Mac has never been married, or 
probably had a LT girlfriend but if the wife wants something, a half arsed 
solution like slapping Windows on top of it wont help, in fact it will make 
things a lot worse.<br>
<br>
 My advice for the OP, let the wife choose. Pick 
about 5 different models that you know are good (Dell Latitude, Lenovo 
Thinkpad, Asus and Toshiba, wife will probably like the look of the Asus) put 
some pictures into a document and let her pick which one she wants. That way 
the onus is on her to like it, having her make the decision reduces the 
likelihood that she'll turn around and blame you for any issues (as she is 
currently doing with the Mac).</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

 Almost all 
consumer laptops are terrible. Get a business laptop if you want something that 
is any good. Some examples are HP's EliteBook and ProBook lines, Dell's 
Precision and Latitude lines, and Lenovo's ThinkPad line. Generally speaking, 
if a laptop doesn't have a trackpoint/pointing stick, it isn't worth having. It 
doesn't matter if you want to use it or not, it is a good indication of the 
quality of a laptop. Business laptops generally have: Better Battery life 
Better reliability No crapware More durable designs Higher performance Better 
keyboards and Anti-Glare screens Better conductivity and support for a docking 
station Better and longer warranties Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>I get this all the time from my family/relatives. Here's the rundown:</p> 
<p>Get your preferences in order: Screen size, discrete graphics 
(must/may/must-not), battery life (min) and then just browse Fatwallet's laptop 
section or slickdeals until something that matches comes up. These days, any 
intel i3/i5 processor and 3-4GB of RAM will crush light-office-type tasks. I 
don't worry too much about the brand so long as I've heard of them before. You 
aren't investing enough to make spending tons of hours on research pay off.</p> 
<p>Next up, I want to share a contrary attitude that many of us in the 
non-Apple community feel. I hasten to mention that I'm not saying your attitude 
is wrong, but I want to share a different point of view. You said you don't 
want something that's obsolete in 2 years, but I kind of wonder why? Spending 
$600 every 2 years gets you a lot further than spending $1200 every 4 years. If 
you had bought a $1200 laptop 4 years ago, you'd have a first-gen Core2Duo 
(Merom), 1GB of RAM, 802.11g whereas $600 was a first-gen (Yonah) Centrino, 1GB 
of RAM, 802.11g. Meanwhile, 2 years ago $600 got you a Arrandale i3, 3GB of RAM 
and a far better Intel GMA (one that can accelerate h264@1080p) with 802.11n 
and +50% battery life. So you got 2 years of a slightly faster laptop in 
exchange for 2 years with a much inferior one all at the same price.</p> 
<p>Apple gets you into the habit of spending a whole heck of a lot of money 
for a really nice machine, I'm trying to suggest that in the Windows world, 
buying less laptop more often nets you more bang for your buck over time. 
What's more, the commodification of the laptop means you have so much less at 
stake regarding breakage. I love not caring about cases, biking with laptop in 
a backpack, traveling around with it, not investing in a laptop-lock-cable, not 
caring if my nephew spills apple-juice all over it (the keyboard tray got most 
of it, the laptop lived on). There are people for whom spending more makes 
sense: graphic designers need a color-accurate IPS LCD, road-warriors need 
something super portable, gamers need the latest mobile video cards. For the 
rest of everyone, get a cheapo laptop, beat the crap out of it and then replace 
it.</p> 
<p>Finally, for those that suggest I'm creating a bunch of unnecessary waste 
(leaving aside that I'm getting tangible utility out of shorter cycle here), 
every one of my old laptops has been DBANed and sent over to FreeGeek (where I 
volunteer) to further their service. It's not waste if you can find a use for 
it!</p> Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>In my opinion, keyboard and touchpad characteristics are probably the most 
important factors in PC laptops. Other than that, good internal hardware 
hardware is very cheap and similar among brands (Caveats being Intel chips tend 
to run a bit cooler for the same performance vs. AMD, and if you care about 
discrete video go for one that has that, otherwise ram and hard drives are 
easily accessible/upgradeable, but I'm sure other threads are covering that).
</p> 
<p>Keyboards:<br>
One of the main things about PC keyboards is the Ctrl vs. Fn 
key. You will find yourself using the Ctrl key very often (less so than in a 
mac since right click is built in, but still); it's generally more 
ergonomically comfortable to use the leftmost edge of your left hand to hit the 
ctrl button<i>if that's where it's located</i>. I know for many laptops I've 
purchased the Ctrl and Fn key are swapped, and getting to do anything like 
copy/paste ctrl + C, Ctrl + v, Ctrl + tab, ctrl + click, ctrl + whatever is a 
minor hand-cramp inducing PITA. If you like keyboard hotkeys, best advice is to 
find one with the Ctrl keys taking the spotlight.</p> 
<p>Mice:<br>
Not only do the designs vary by quite a large bit between 
manufacturers as far as hardware implementation--Some that have one smooth 
metallic surface that only does tap response, some that have rough textured 
surfaces for tactile response, to Thinkpads with a nipple and touchpad and 
about six different ways to click and doubleclick--but it's also important to 
keep in mind that the mice action will almost NEVER feel as intuitive or as 
good as a Mac. The hardware is assembled from various OEM distributors, and 
depending on who they sourced their touchpad to and how good their driver 
development is, you will either get basic &quot;scroll bars along edge of 
pad&quot; functionality, or very poorly implemented pinch-zoom. On top of that, 
I have an Ideapad G-560 with a touchpad so insensitive slash oversensitive at 
exactly the wrong times you'd think it was steam driven. One HUGE annoyance is 
the cursor clicking to some random spot when your palm touches it while you're 
typing an essay. Have that happen a couple times and your document gets swiss 
cheesed with sentence fragments.<br>
Unless every review you read for the lappy 
you're about to get has no qualms about keyboard or touchpad, definitely try to 
poke around, maybe play solitaire to test out the tap-click-hold-drag 
functionality, and try typing a couple paragraphs in a word document to make 
sure the cursor doesn't go Ouija board on you.</p> Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>If the goal is to run Windows, with a real two or three-button touch pad or

can get decent customer service, and parts are available well out of warranty.

<p>What are her requirements? If she needs massive storage or wants mirrored 
storage, look for a notebook with internal RAID - like the Dell Precision M6500 
(I have the M6400, which is the M6500's predecessor, and I love it - desktop 
chipset, RGB-LED backlit display, it's built like a tank, and is 
uber-serviceable so easy to upgrade and maintain) or if you don't want to spend 
that much on a notebook, consider the Latitude line, which generally use the 
same chassis as the Precision line (so they are also built like tanks) but with 
mobile chipsets and tend to be slightly lighter. Another option to save money 
is to call the Dell Outlet and see if they have the model you want as an 
&quot;open box&quot; return. It would still be marked with a refurb SKU but 
would be in perfect, as-new condition, and you can save up to $3K on the 
notebook like I did. Availability from the outlet can be spotty though - I had 
to call to get the configuration I wanted. They could have 20 of the exact 
config you want on hand today, and zero tomorrow, and three the next day. 
People often scour the outlet and flip them on feeBay and at computer fairs.</p>
<p>The items you want to check:</p> 
<p> &nbsp; * How solid is the chassis? Will the screen hinges hold up?</p> 
<p>On consumer models if you are not careful opening and closing the screen by 
grasping it at the sides near the hinges you will flex and eventually break the 
frame. On business models, you can just press down at the top of the screen and 
it won't flex, and it will close properly. I actually dropped my M6400 at a 
customer site, and it fell 3' to the tiled-covered concrete floor. It didn't 
damage it at all but for a consumer chassis I would have had to buy a whole new 
screen/lid/hinge assembly</p> 
<p> &nbsp; * How serviceable is it? Download the service manuals of the model 
you are looking at. Are you going to hate the tedium of the four-hour project 
of upgrading the processor and hard drives, or will it be a 15 minute task? How 
accessible are the SO-DIMM slots?<br>
 &nbsp; * Does it offer all the 
connectivity you need?<br>
 &nbsp; * How easily can you get at the heat sinks 
to clean out the inevitable dust and lint?</p>
