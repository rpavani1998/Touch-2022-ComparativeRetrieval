<p>You can build a &quot;pretty good&quot; PC for less than a mac if you only

<p>They were marketing some of their Macs/Powerbooks as if they could run 
MS-DOS programs. This somewhat helped. That was false.</p> 
<p>You are mistaken. In the 90s some Macs came with a x86 coprocessor card, it 
was basically a PC in a slot. So yes, Apple did have Macs that could run MS-DOS 
and Windows just fine back in the 90s.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Fast forward to now, since the x86 macs, they can finally actually run 
MS-DOS programs. (boot disk of course)</p> 
<p>That is also mistaken. You can dual boot or use a virtual machine. As a 
matter of fact the virtual machine software on the Mac can run Windows from 
that dual boot partition or a more typical VM filesystem file(s). So if you 
want to conveniently run some office type app on the Mac desktop you can do so, 
and when you want to run a game and get full performance you can dual boot 
rather than emulate.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>
