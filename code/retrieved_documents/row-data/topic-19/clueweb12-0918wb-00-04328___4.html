<h2>~Which is the better Windows emulator? Well that depends . .&nbsp;.</h2> 
<p>Posted by John Kendrick on January 3, 2008</p> 
<p>A common question &ldquo;switchers&rdquo; have these days is whether to use 
Parallels, VMware Fusion, or Boot Camp on their Mac for Windows emulation? The 
answer seems to depend on what you want to do with Windows, and what version 
you intend to run.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For a comparison, and some insights into the differences, read the 
Parallels vs. VMware Fusion shootout at Apple Insider. While I would encourage 
you to read the entire article and benchmarks, the most important details of 
the study&rsquo;s conclusions are quoted from the underlyingMacTech article 
here.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>If you don&rsquo;t want Mac integration, and just want to run Windows, 
go with Boot Camp. It&rsquo;s faster than a PC anyway.</em></p> <em> 
<p>If you want a virtualization product (that allows you to run Windows 
alongside Mac OS X), and you want the best performance for the types of things 
that we tested, then clearly you need to run XP and not Vista. Furthermore, in 
our tests, both VMware Fusion and Parallels performed well, and were a good 
user experience. That said, Parallels was somewhat faster in general than 
VMware Fusion for XP.</p> </em> 
<p><em>If you want the best virtualization performance for Vista, then VMware 
Fusion is your choice. And, if you want to keep your Mac OS X and Windows 
environments completely separate, VMware Fusion&rsquo;s design may be your 
better choice. (And, although we didn&rsquo;t test it, we would expect VMware 
Fusion to have better multi-processor support if you really have an application 
that is designed to take advantage of it.)<strong>If your goal is tight 
integration between one or more Windows applications and Mac OS X, Parallels is 
the clear winner when running either XP or Vista. And, as we said before, if 
you want the best XP performance with the types of applications tested here, 
Parallels is not only faster than VMware Fusion, but it&rsquo;s faster than 
Boot Camp on average for the applications that we tested.</strong></em> 
(emphasis added)</p> </blockquote> 
<p>You of course need an Intel-based Mac, and a full copy of Windows XP SP2 or 
Windows Vista (Business or Ultimate), in order to run Windows on a Mac using 
any of these solutions. The copy that came with your PC or an upgrade will not 
work. I recommend Windows XP over Vista if you want to use OS X as your main 
operating system and just want to use Windows to run applications that require 
it.Windows XP Home Edition SP2B for System Builders was available on Amazon for 
$89 as of the date of this post. They actually recommend this purchase with 
Parallels, though you don&rsquo;t have to purchase the two together. This is a 
very good price for Windows XP SP2, and is what I used for my latest Windows 
install on my new iMac.</p> 
<p>I have personally used both Boot Camp and Parallels, and currently have 
Parallels v3 running on a 2.33 ghz MacBook Pro with 3gb ram, and a new 2.4ghz 
iMac with 4gb ram. To be honest, I cannot discern any difference in speed 
between my original implementation of Boot Camp and later Parallels install, 
however, not having to reboot into each OS, and the ease with which files can 
be shared between OS&rsquo;s are major advantages that Parallels has over Boot 
Camp. You can read about my experiences with theMBP Leopard Install with 
Parallels 3 in an earlier post by the same name.</p>
