<h1>Is Ubuntu Linux a Sensible Alternative for Mac Users?</h1> 
<h3>A 'Best of Miscellaneous Ramblings' Column</h3> 
<p>Charles Moore - 2006.09.18 - Tip Jar</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>A friend of mine phoned to ask if I thought he should install Ubuntu Linux 
on his Macs - a1.33 GHz G4 iBook currently running OS&nbsp;X 10.4 
&quot;Tiger&quot; and a1.25 GHz Power Mac G4 tower with OS&nbsp;X 10.3 
&quot;Panther&quot; installed.</p> 
<p>My friend had read a feature in the local newspaper extolling the virtues 
of Ubuntu Linux and thought it sounded interesting.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu is a other project dedicated to making Linux user-friendly enough to 
be used as a mainstream desktop OS, and it's arguably the most successful 
iteration toward that objective to date. Ubuntu supports Intel/AMD PC hardware 
as well as Power PC Macs.</p> 
<p>Does Ubuntu Linux make any sense for Macintosh users?</p> 
<p>In my friend's case, I would say no, and I did.</p> 
<p>He's an experienced, but not especially tech-savvy, non-power user, and the 
geek aspect of Linux would be of no interest or service to him. The machines he 
has are powerful and up-to-date enough to run OS&nbsp;X very comfortably. He 
has a suite of Mac software, and I can perceive no advantage and many potential 
pitfalls in his switching to Linux.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, for users of older Mac hardware, particularly machines 
not supported by OS&nbsp;X, Linux is a way to give them a new lease on life 
with a modern, secure, and robust operating system that requires less power and 
processor overhead on their less-than-cutting-edge equipment.</p> 
<p>Older Mac software can be accommodated using the Mac on Linux emulator - a 
sort of &quot;Classic Mode&quot; for Linux on PowerPC Macs.</p> 
<p>Linux also has the advantage of being free.</p> 
<p>The main advantage, as I see it, of using a Macintosh is that it runs the 
Mac OS, which is unmatched and unchallenged in terms of user-friendliness. Like 
Linux, OS&nbsp;X gives you the stability and power of Unix (albeit from 
different branches of the Unix family tree), but combined with the best graphic 
user interface yet devised for personal computers, ease of software 
installation, and, with rare exceptions, true plug and play - &quot;it just 
works&quot; - with peripherals and networking support.</p> 
<h4>...I kept asking myself, &quot;Why would I want to put up with the 
aggravations and hassles of using Linux on a computer that supports the Mac 
OS?&quot;</h4> 
<p>I've installed a couple of Linux distros - SuSE and Yellow Dog - on Macs in 
the past, partly as an exercise in curiosity. It was an interesting trip, but I 
kept asking myself, &quot;Why would I want to put up with the aggravations and 
hassles of using Linux on a computer that supports the Mac OS?&quot;</p> 
<p>I couldn't come up with anything convincing.</p> 
<p>Consequently, if I had a non-Apple PC, Ubuntu Linux would probably be my 
first choice of operating systems, but with a Mac, you already have the best 
operating system in world.</p> 
<p>However, if you're interested in Ubuntu, it's a complete Linux-based 
operating system, freely available with both community and professional support 
being developed by a large community.</p> 
<p>Gnome is the default desktop user interface for Ubuntu. It can also be 
installed with the ubuntu-desktop package, while KDE is the default desktop for 
theKubuntu variant.</p> 
<p>The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu 
Philosophy: Software should be available free of charge, software tools should 
be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and 
people should have the freedom to customize and alter their software in 
whatever way they see fit.</p> 
<p>The current Ubuntu release supports PC (Intel x86), 64-bit PC (AMD64), 
UltraSPARC T1 (Sun Fire T1000 and T2000), and PowerPC (iBook and PowerBook, G4 
and G5) architectures.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu includes more than 16,000 pieces of software, but the core desktop 
installation fits on a single CD. Ubuntu covers every standard desktop 
application from word processing and spreadsheet applications to web server 
software and programming tools.</p> 
<p>A standard Ubuntu install contains a selection of applications, including 
OpenOffice 2.0 for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations, the GIMP 
for image editing and the Firefox web browser more. You can Play, rip and mix 
your CDs with the Rhythmbox Media Player or play your videos in Totem.</p> 
<p>You can download the Ubuntu DesktopCD and test Ubuntu without changing 
anything on your computer. If you want to keep Ubuntu permanently, there is an 
easy installer right on the DesktopCD.</p> 
<p>You may request CDs at https://shipit.ubuntu.com</p> 
<p>Maybe you'll like it; maybe not.</p> 
<h3>Switching from Mac to Linux?</h3> 
<p>Earlier this year, longtime Mac programmers Tim Bray and Mark Pilgrim 
stirred the waters of the Mac community by announcing that they were switching 
from Mac OS&nbsp;X to Ubuntu. However, Bray recently expressed some sober 
second thought in a blog posting, For Now I'm a Macboy Again, in which he 
observes:</p> 
<p>&quot;On balance, the Mac experience is better. But Ubuntu is not that far 
behind, and it's catching up. I'm thinking about the endgame.&quot;</p> 
<p>He goes on to list a variety of areas where the Mac OS is superior. </p>
