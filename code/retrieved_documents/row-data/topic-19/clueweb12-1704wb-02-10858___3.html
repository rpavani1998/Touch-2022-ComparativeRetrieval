<h2>PC vs. Mac</h2> 
<p> by Nathan King <br>
(Ocala, Fl) </p> 
<p> &quot;Good morning Ocala I'm Nathan.&quot; &quot;And I'm Chase, and your 
listening to CAN radio!&quot; &quot; So lately I've been hearing a lot of talk 
about the battle between PC and Mac. I've been wondering which one you think is 
better?&quot;<br>
&quot; Well Nathan their both great computers but I believe 
it's all about personal opinion.&quot; &quot; well I say we go to one of our 
callers and get their thoughts' on these two corporations.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
&quot;Hi caller number one your on CAN radio.&quot;&quot;Hi Chase and Nathan my 
name is Debbie. I love your show!&quot;&quot;Well thanks. So lets get back to 
the topic of the day. Debbie which do you prefer Mac or PC?&quot; 
&quot;Personally I'm more of a Mac type of person&quot; &quot;Why is 
that?&quot; &quot;Well to start off I own a Mac and I feel like Mac is the 
better computer. Don't get me wrong PC is a good computer but Mac just has that 
extra oomph to put it over the top. I'm talking about the devices such as the 
iTouch, the iPad, the computers. All the bundles up into one whole package just 
blows PC out of the water.&quot; &quot;Well thank you Debbie for that wonderful 
insight on your thought on the Mac&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot; Hi your on Can 
radio&quot; &quot;Hey you guys I'm Dan&quot; Hi Dan thanks for calling in. So 
the question is PC or Mac. Which one are you?&quot; &quot; To be honest I like 
PC over Mac.&quot; &quot;And why is that&quot; &quot;Well I am in the computer 
business and I work on a Pc and have a PC for the main computer and to me PC is 
the best computer out there. Granted Mac does have some good gadgets and 
computers but PC I think beats them by a land slide. Not just because I own one 
but over half of Americans do as well. I feel as if it the best computer on the 
market.&quot; &quot;Well thanks for your thought on the PC have a good 
day.&quot; &quot;Thanks you too.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Well there you have it. 
One for PC one for Mac. Guess that feud lives on. Thanks for listening to CAN 
radio that's all the time we have. I'm Nathan.&quot; &quot;And I'm Chase and 
this is CAN radio signing off.&quot;<br>
