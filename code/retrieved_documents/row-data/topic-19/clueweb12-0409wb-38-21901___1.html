<p>user comments</p>  Which is better for filmmaking, PC or Mac? 
<p>Having used both Discreet and Premiere on PCs, and Final Cut Pro on a Mac, 
I would say, software speaking, Final Cut is slightly better than Discreet (and 
both products are light years beyond Premiere in my opinion)<br>
<br>
 However, 
when it comes to hardware, I would have to say that the Mac also has the 
advantage. The Discreet system though powerful, costs quite a bit on the side 
of hardware, and running on Windows NT (can't comment on XP) had a fair number 
of crashes. The FCP system ran fine on a high end eMac, which is a consumer 
model. As well, the powerPC architecture has far more advanced FPU's than x86.
<br> <br>
 In day to dy use, this is not substuantial enough to cause mass 
panic between the two, but having used both, in my opinion, the Mac is slightly 
the superior.</p>
