<h1>&pound;22 Raspberry Pi PC pushes the value of coding skills</h1>  By 
Gerald Lynch on February 29, 2012 Comments (0) <br>

<p><br>
 Today saw the long-awaited launch of the Raspberry Pi PC. Costing 
just under &pound;22, the credit-card sized PC sold out just minutes after 
going on sale earlier today.</p> 
<p>Designed by Robert Mullins and Eben Upton and distributed by the Raspberry 
Pi foundation, it's intended to inspire a new wave of UK coding enthusiasts in 
much the same way the BBC Micro did long ago.</p> 
<p>Most pertinently, it's caught the attention of educators, with MP Michael 
Gove suggesting the device could have significant value for schools at a time 
when the UK education system is being criticised for its lack of computer 
science teaching.</p> 
<p>Without any sort of casing and with its chips and components fully exposed, 
the Raspberry Pi isn't much of a looker. However, it's a fully-working 
ARM-based PC, with a HMDI port, two USB ports, Ethernet, audio output and an SD 
card slot.</p> 
<p>It allows for the playback of HD video, as well as having the ability to 
carry out day-to-day computing tasks such as word processing and spreadsheet 
management, and also play less intensive games.</p> 
<p>Stockists RS Components and Premier Farnell are now taking pre-orders for 
the second batch of Raspberry Pi PCs.</p>

<h1>Samsung Series 9 notebook UK release date set for this month</h1>  By 
Gerald Lynch on February 22, 2012 Comments (0) <br>

<p>Samsung have finally revealed the release date of their Samsung Series 9 
laptop, with the super-slim machine hitting the UK by the end of February.</p> 
<p>Revealed back at CES, the Series 9 is the world's slimmest laptop, 
measuring just 12.9mm, and set to go toe-to-toe with Apple's MacBook Air line.
</p> 
<p>Under the hood it's boasting some pretty nifty specs, with an Intel Core i5 
processor, 4GB of memory and an 128GB SSD. The pairing of the fast processor 
and SSD allow for the inclusion of Samsung's &quot;Fast Start&quot; technology, 
which sees the machine wake up and ready to work in just 1.48 seconds.</p> 
<p>A HD+ SuperBright Plus sees the laptop perform well even in direct 
sunlight, while the battery should stretch to 7 hours with moderate usage.</p> 
<p>John Lewis have a short initial period of exclusivity for the laptop, which 
will hit their stores on 25th February.</p> <br>

<h1>Alienware set PC gaming sights on the living room with mini X51 desktop
</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on January 18, 2012 Comments (0) <br>

<p>Alienware have today announced the launch of the X51 mini gaming desktop. 
&quot;The smallest desktop Alienware has ever created,&quot; according to the 
press release, it sits in an exciting position between the power of a high-spec 
gaming PC and the form factor of a games console.</p> 
<p>Measuring just 12.5&acirc;&#128;&sup3; deep and 13.5&acirc;&#128;&sup3; 
wide, it's little bigger than an Xbox 360 but massively more powerful.</p> 
<p>As comfortable next to a flatscreen TV as a monitor, it'll sit either 
horizontally or stand vertically. It's connectivity options include HDMI 1.4, 
4x USB 2.0 slots, 2x USB 3.0, Ethernet and speaker connectors.</p> 
<p>The differing specification configurations available are as follows:</p> 
<p><em><strong>Processor</strong></em></p> <em> 
<p>Intel&reg; Core&acirc;&#132;&cent; i3-2120 (3.30GHz, 3MB L3 Cache, 2C)<br>
 
Intel&reg; Core&acirc;&#132;&cent; i5-2320 (3.00GHz, 6MB L3 Cache, 4C)<br>
 
Intel&reg; Core&acirc;&#132;&cent; i7-2600 (3.40GHz, 8MB L3 Cache, 8C)</p> 
<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p> 
<p>1GB NVIDIA&reg; GeForce&reg; GT 545<br>
 1GB NVIDIA&reg; GeForce&reg; GTX 
555</p> 
<p><strong>Memory</strong></p> 
<p>4096MB (2x2GB) 1333MHz DDR3 Dual Channel<br>
 6144MB (1x4GB) (1x2GB) 
1333MHz DDR3 Dual Channel<br>
 8192MB (2x4GB) 1333MHz DDR3 Dual Channel</p> 
<p><strong>Hard Drive</strong></p> 
<p>1TB (32MB Cache) 7,200RPM Hard Drive</p> 
<p><strong>Optical</strong></p> 
<p>24X Dual-Layer Burner (DVD&plusmn;RW) (Standard)</p> 
<p><strong>Audio</strong></p> 
<p>Internal High-Definition 7.1 Performance Audio with Waves MAXX Audio 
Software</p> 
<p><strong>Wireless</strong></p> </em> 
<p><em>Integrated 802.11 a/b/g/n Wi-Fi Wireless LAN</em></p> 
<p>When you keep in mind that all components are of standard size, meaning 
they'll be easily upgradeable in the future, the X51 seems like a superb 
addition to the gamer's living room. It's a pity it doesn't come with a Blu-ray 
drive; the one thing stopping the mini-desktop from being a true living room 
media hub.</p> 
<p>It's an exciting time to a be a PC gamer. With recent massive launches like 
<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>, and upcoming launches 
like<em>StarCraft II: Heart of the Storm</em> and <em>Diablo III</em>(as well 
as mad new concept designs likeRazer's Project Fiona tablet), there's plenty of 
fun to be had and innovative hardware to gawk at.</p> 
<p>With prices starting at &pound;699, it's also a very affordable entry into 
pre-built PC gaming. We'll look forward to getting our hands on one of these 
when it launches on February 6th.</p>

<h1>CES 2012 VIDEO: Lenovo IdeaCenter A720 All-In-One hands-on</h1>  By Gerald 
Lynch on January 11, 2012 Comments (1) <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Giant tablet, or touchscreen PC? Ah, the first world problems we face every 
day in consumer technology. Lenovo have at least removed that quandary from 
your trembling brain this week, by introducing the gigantic Lenovo IdeaCenter 
A720 All-In-One PC.</p> 
<p>Measuring 27 inches diagonally, it packs in a Core-i7 Sandy Bridge CPU, 8GB 
of RAM, up to 1.8TB of storage space (with SSD options), a 2GB discrete 
graphics card and a Blu-ray drive. The screen is full HD at 1920 by 1200 
pixels, supporting ten-finger multitouch.</p> 
<p>Where it comes into its own however is its flexibility. Though the A720 can 
stand tall like a regular All-In-One desktop machine, it also folds flat to be 
used as a massive tabletop tablet device.</p> 
<p>Hit the video above to see a Lenovo spokesperson demo the device direct 
from the CES 2012 show floor.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Remember the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga hybrid ultrabook/tablet device we showed 
you yesterday? Well we've now seen it in person, and it's just as impressive as

<p>Running Windows 8, the 13.3 inch screen can be swivelled 360-degrees to 
position it in a laptop format with keyboard, flat slate like shape, a stand 
for watching video and, er, a tent as Lenovo themselves like to describe it.</p>

<h1>CES 2012: Lenovo get flexible with IdeaPad Yoga Windows 8 tablet/ultrabook 
hybrid</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on January 10, 2012 Comments (0) <br>

<p><br>
 Lenovo are brinigng a little added flexibility to their latest batch 
of ultrabooks with the IdeaPad Yoga, a hybrid tablet/ultrabook machine running 
Windows 8.</p> 
<p>Powered by an Intel Core processor backed by up to 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD, 
the IdeaPad Yoga is engineered around a four-point viewing mode principle.</p> 
<p>In other words, the 360-degree twisting 1600x900, 13.3 inch touch screen 
can be positioned to work like a standard laptop with keyboard, folded flat 
like a tablet with the screen facing outwards, stood up like an open book, or 
hinged like a tent in the picture above.</p> 
<p>It's also the thinnest convertible ultrabook yet (of which there are 
admittedly few), measuring just 16.9mm deep and weighing 1.47kg.</p> 
<p>&quot;It is clear to us that consumers want their four screens: mobile 
devices, tablets, notebooks and smart TVs and they want them to work together 
seamlessly, anytime, anywhere,&quot; said Yang Yuanqing, Chairman and CEO for 
Lenovo.</p> 
<p>&quot;The IdeaPad YOGA multi-mode notebook redefines the convergence and 
convertible user experience by bringing together the best of traditional PCs, 
with the best of tablets.&quot;</p> 
<p>Expect to see the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga starting at $1199 (around &pound;775) 
when it lands sometime in the second half of the year. No word yet on a UK 
launch.</p>

<h1>Razer tease Project Fiona: &quot;PC gaming in an all-new form factor&quot;
</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on January 4, 2012 Comments (0) <br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
 Razer are the latest tech manufacturer to tease their CES 2012 hand 
prior to next week's big show in Las Vegas.</p> 
<p>The PC peripheral makers have been making tentative steps into the realm of 
gaming machines for a few years now, capturing the public eye with the boldly 
designedSwitchblade and Razer Blade machines.</p> 
<p>It now looks as if Razer are to make yet another step towards their 
ultimate goal of reviving PC gaming in the wake of console gaming dominance, 
posting a new teaser trailer for &quot;Project Fiona&quot;, which will be fully 
revealed at CES 2012.</p> 
<p>The video gives away very little, other than promising an 
&quot;all-new&quot; form factor for PC gaming, as well as suggesting from the 
clip that high-end games such as<em>Assassin's Creed: Revelations</em> will be 
playable on the device.</p> 
<p>However, with neither the Switchblade nor Razer Blade yet available to buy, 
will Project Fiona prove to be the final realisation of Razer's gaming machine 
vision, or just another prototype to linger in development hell?</p> 
<p>Well, we'll be sure to find out next week, when the Tech Digest/ Shiny Shiny
 teams touch down in Las Vegas for the big CES 2012 show.</p>

<h1>No touching the HP Omnia 27 quad-core All-in-One PC</h1>  By Gerald Lynch 
onJanuary 4, 2012 Comments (0) <br>

<p>HP are looking to wipe tech fans clean of an lingering TouchPad and webOS 
memories with the launch of the promising new HP Omnia 27 All-in-One PC.</p> 
<p>Featuring a lush, edge-to-edge 27 inch 1080p display, it packs all its 
innards, including a 2TB hard drive, HDMI input, Blu-ray drive and quad-core 
Intel processor, into its tabletop chassis.</p> 
<p>However, like a prison scene from Arrested Development, there's no touching 
allowed with the HP Omnia 27, as that whopping display isn't touch-enabled. 
You'll need to pop into the company's TouchSmart line if multi-touch gestures 
and swiping is what you're after.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, the machine also boasts Beats Audio, Windows 7, 6 USB slots and 
a multi-card reader, as well as the ability to tilt the screen 25 degrees.</p> 
<p>Due out in February in the UK, now pricing for our shores has yet been 
revealed. Stateside readers however will be able to get their hands on the 
Omnia 27 from January 8, with prices starting at $1,200 (&pound;767).</p> <br>

<h1>Happy 30th birthday, Commodore 64!</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on January 4, 2012
Comments (1) <br>

<p><strong><em>Happy 30th birthday, Commodore 64! </em></strong></p> 
<p>The bulky brown home computing box of choice of the 1980's hits the three 
decade landmark this month, and is fondly remembered by many a tech fan 
(including this very Tech Digest writer) as their first experience with home 
computing.</p> 
<p>A tame machine by today's standards, its 8-bit charms with a MOS Technology 
6510 processor running at a 1MHz, 64k of memory and 16-colour graphics chip 
were as good as it got upon release in 1982.</p> 
<p>For many, the machine was also their first taste of the delights of gaming 
at home, stuffing cassette tapes into the C64 rather than stuffing their pocket 
money into the local arcade machines. They took an age to load, but offered 
hours upon hours of fun. Anyone who has ever pulled off a split-kick double 
takedown in<em>International Karate +</em>, or ran through the legs of the Stay 
Puft Marshmallow Man in<em>Ghostbusters </em>will sing the machine's praises.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Anyone looking to get into making chiptune music should definitely check 
out the C64 too. The likes of Rob Hubbard, David Whittaker and Martin Galway 
were doing trailblazing stuff with game soundtracks using the machines SID 
chip, the influence of which can be heard in music by the likes of Crystal 
Castles. Justcheck this selection of tracks if you need convincing.</p> 
<p>Though getting off to a slow start after being revealed at the 1981 CES 
show,17 million units Commodore 64 units went on to be sold. Dominating the 
1980s, the machine fell out of vogue by the 1990s as Nintendo, Sega and Amiga 
machines become increasingly popular, and by the middle of the decade Commodore 
had filed for bankruptcy. A Commodore 65 prototype was built, but never hit 
mass production.</p> 
<p>While it's very easy to get your hands on a Commodore 64 emulator (there's 
even one as an app for Apple devices), and just as easy to pick up a retro 
machine from eBay, a new company calledCommodore USA in 2012 began to produce a 
new machine called the Commodore 64x. A great gift for fans of the original 
machine, it completely keeps the bulky build of the computer, but adds modern 
specifications like dual-core, 1.8GHz Intel Atom D525 chip, an Nvidia Ion 2 
GPU, Wi-Fi and a Blu-ray drive.</p> 
<p><em>So, were you the lucky owner of a Commodore 64 back in the 1980s? What 
were your fondest memories of the machine? Share them via the comments section 
below, ourTwitter feed or our Facebook page, and we'll publish some of the best 
in a Tech Digest post!</em></p> <br>

<h1>Dell ring the netbook death knell</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on December 16, 
2011 Comments (1) <br>

<p>The age of the netbook is well and truly over, and nothing rings the death 
knell more loud and clear than when a massive PC manufacturer like Dell 
announces it's stepping out of the market sector.</p> 
<p>After Dell's Inspirion Mini line silently fell off the radar, the company 
have since confirmed that they will no longer be producing the little 
low-powered laptops.</p> 
<p>&quot;Thin and powerful is where it is at for us,&quot; Dell's marketing 
director Alison Gardner toldThe Verge. </p> 
<p>Thin and powerful? Like <strong><em>ultrabook </em></strong>thin and 
powerful?</p> 
<p>It looks that way, though Gardner cleverly avoided using the term and all 
the weight of expectation the new product category brings with it.</p> 
<p>Dell's XPS 14z is the closest thing they've built recently to what could be 
compared to a premium-feeling ultrabook, but would need to slim down even 
further without compromising on power to really get consumers pulses racing and 
offer a genuine challenge to Apple's Air range and the wave of ultrabooks on 
the way from Samsung and Acer.</p> 
<p>We'll be keeping a close eye on Dell in the coming months to see how they 
approach this exciting new sector of the PC market. We'd expect to hear a 
little bit more come CES in Las Vegas this coming January, so check back then 
for all the news from the show floor.<br>

<h1>Samsung to slide out of netbook market next year?</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on 
November 25, 2011 Comments (5) <br>

<p>Samsung may be preparing to quit production of their netbook lines as soon 
as next year, according to a leaked email from the company.</p> 
<p>The message, sent to a trade partner, states that 10.1 inch devices will be 
getting the chop, with Samsung to re-focus their energies on the ultrabook 
sector.</p> 
<p>&quot;Following the introduction of our new strategy in Q1 2012, we stop 
the product range in 10.1&quot; (Netbook) in Q1 2012 for the benefit of 
Ultraportables products (11.6 and 12-inches) and ultrabooks to be launched in 
2012,&quot; reveals the email.</p> 
<p>Samsung's move is unexpected, but not wholly surprising. Netbooks have 
faced a stiff decline in popularity following the rise of the 
ever-more-powerful, ever-more-portable, ever-more-business-friendly tablet.</p> 
<p>Ultrabooks now offer a far more attractive proposition than netbooks. 
Powerful, slick, and often taking design inspiration from Apple's own book of 
tricks, the premium ultrabook sector looks to be where the portable computing 
market is headed.</p>

<h1>REVIEW: Kodak Hero 9.1 all-in-one printer/scanner/copier</h1>  By Gerald 
Lynch on November 21, 2011 Comments (1) <br>

<p>Name: <strong> Kodak Hero 9.1</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>Type: <strong>All-in-One printer/scanner/copier</strong>
</p> 
<p>Specs: Click here for full specs</p> 
<p>Price: <strong>&pound;199.99</strong></p> 
<p><br>
<em>The Kodak Hero 9.1 throws into the mix pretty much every high-end 
feature you can think of for a consumer all-in-one printer. Can its print speed 
and quality live up to the allure of its silky 4.3 inch touchscreen and 
cloud-printing capabilities? Read on to find out.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you're flushed with cash, the &pound;199.99 Kodak Hero 9.1 is the 
premium offering from the company's all-in-one printer range. With a 4.3 inch 
touchscreen, Wi-Fi and internet connectivity, duplex printing and cloud 
printing, it ticks every box when it comes to high-end printer features.</p> 
<p>It looks very stylish too. In keeping with the rest of the Hero range's 
boxy look, the rectangular Hero 9.1 features a mix of gloss and black plastics, 
as well as brushed metal effects either side of the print tray and a red trim 
just under the scanner lid. Two paper trays feature, one each for 100 regular 
A4 sheets and another solely for 40 pieces of photo paper. It's a relief not to 
have to swap paper load outs, and the powered photo tray also conveniently 
removes the need to manually push sheets. We'd like to see dual-trays hit 
consumer printers as standard. A printer is unlikely to win any style awards, 
but Kodak have made a strong effort here to make the Hero 9.1 look tidy and 
sleek.</p> 
<p>Only one physical button (the power one) sits on the Hero 9.1's control 
panel. The rest, including home, back, help and preview keys, are touch 
sensitive, illuminating when they can be used to navigate a corresponding 
function on the gorgeous 4.3 inch touchscreen. A touchscreen this big makes a 
massively good impression; it not only allows a full QWERTY keyboard to be 
displayed, making the Wi-Fi set up really simple, but also gives you a far more 
legible look at any snaps you plan to print off too using the Hero 9.1's 
front-mounted USB and memory card ports.</p> 
<p>Setting up the printer is as simple as it gets. After removing a series of 
protective tags, inserting the print head and clicking in the two ink 
cartridges, it's just a matter of switching it on, installing the relevant 
drivers to your computer, and choosing whether to connect using a standard USB 
cable, or over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p> 
<p>If you choose to go down the web-connected route, you also open up the 
ability to use Kodak's cloud printing service, that lets you send documents to 
be printed to the unit no matter where you are in the world. The Hero 9.1 is 
compatible with Google's Cloud Printing service, further expanding your 
on-the-go print options and effectively doing away with the need to ever have 
it permanently tethered to your desktop machine.</p> 
<p>Though not class leading, the Kodak Hero's 9.1 print speed and quality 
remains solid. A 10-sheet set of single sided black-and-white text documents 
printed in two minutes and one second, while a twenty page set of single sided 
documents sped up noticeably, taking three minutes and 47 seconds. Duplex 
printing, as you'd expect, was noticeably slower, adding a good third onto the 
time to print the same documents on a single side. Duplex printing on the whole 
had some quirks, with the printer automatically reducing the print size by a 
noticeable margin. Be sure to extend your page margins manually before printing 
duplex pages as a result, or you'll end up with considerable space around the 
edges of your prints. In all tests however, text was crisp and sharp.</p> 
<p>Colour prints were considerably slower, but we were surprised at the snappy 
speed of photo prints. In just 45 seconds we had a 4 x 6 inch holiday snap 
sitting in our hands, ready to be tucked inside an album. Colour print quality 
was mostly great, delivering really vibrant, rich colours that shone on photo 
paper. There were a few isolated cases of banding (and dotting for those anally 
examining their photos with a magnifying glass), but overall it was an 
impressive show from the Hero 9.1.</p> 
<p>The Hero 9.1 is fairly cost effective too, working out at roughly 2.25p per 
black and white sheet and 3.8p for colour prints, including paper costs. 
However, when it comes to colour prints you could argue that that figure could 
erratically jump. The Kodak Hero 9.1 uses a single cartridge for all of its 
colour pools. Should one run out quicker than the rest, you're going to have to 
swap out all the colours and abandon any reserves they may have left.</p> 
<p>Lastly, printing and scanning. The scanner lid has an automatic document 
feeder, letting you scan multiple sheets in one go without having to replace 
each one manually. There's also a small hinge on the scanner lid, letting you 
more comfortable accommodate a book or magazine for scanning purposes. The 9.1 
only manages single-side scanning however. Still, the scanner has a solid 
2400dpi optical resolution, delivering accurate colour and detail levels. 
Copying capabilities are just as impressive, delivering a black and white sheet 
with great accuracy in just 17 seconds.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>It's not the cheapest all-in-one on the market, nor the fastest, 
but the Kodak Hero 9.1 does deliver solid print and scanning results, as well 
as offering a premium feature set that you'll be hard pressed to 
comprehensively find elsewhere. The single cartridge for all colours however is 
a disappointment; while it may ease the set-up process, it does mean you wont 
be able to eke the very last drops out of of each colour pool should one run 
dry.</strong></p>

<h1>Parallels Desktop 7 unleashing the power in Apple</h1>  By Greg Collins on 
November 18, 2011 Comments (0) <br>

<p></p> 
<p>We all know that Apple produce some of the most powerful laptops and 
desktops that need no configuration at all. The build quality of the computers 
is second to none, im actually writing this on a four year old macbook which is 
still fully working and in great condition. The Apple software is also some of 
the industry's finest, if you know how to use it that is.</p> 
<p>To many who have only ever had a PC in their life, sometimes working with 
Apple's operating system can be quite a daunting task, everything is new and 
there aren't any of your usual applications for doing your day to day tasks.</p>
<p>To try and provide a bridge between the two operating systems Parallels has 
come out with their software Parallels Desktop 7. It is usually a very big step 
to go from Windows to OSX, i know for me it was a huge step at first and 
sometimes you really want the comfort of your old PC as a safety net. The 
software allows you to run multiple operating systems on your macbook bringing 
together the best hardware and software together.</p> 
<p>The software allows you to run two or more operating systems at the same 
time without the need to use Bootcamp or rebooting your system to switch 
between them, you can literally have them side by side. You can choose from 
Windows 7, Chrome OS, Linux or even get the developers version of Windows 8, 
all running on your macbook.</p> 
<p>The software takes advantage of installing the operating systems as a 
virtual machine, making any additional operating system run faster by not 
putting additional pressure on the RAM and CPU of your computer. The only large 
specification you will need will be hard drive space, you will need around 15GB 
for every operating system.</p> 
<p>If you are not that literate when it comes to computers, parallels has a 
feature called Parallels Wizard that will run through most of the installation 
automatically, choosing the best settings for your computer. The average 
installation time takes between twenty and thirty minutes, which for installing 
an operating system is pretty impressive.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But even though you are working with Windows software it doesn't mean the 
software ignores the Apple features. Trackpad gestures are supported in all 
programs related to Windows, a nice addition, you still feel like your working 
with the quality of a Mac computer. The main advantages of this software is 
using full Windows programs on your Mac, Microsoft Office being one of the main 
pieces that would be popular with users. Because you are working with a full 
version of Office everything works how it should, there is no limitations to 
make it work on a Mac.</p> 
<p>A helpful addition is the full integration of copy and paste, across 
platforms. You can simply drag and drop files across operating systems without 
any file changing or reconfiguring. In the same principle the software also 
allows the user to transfer over their whole PC to their Mac, all their 
personal files, installed software, everything will be transferred saving all 
your investment into older machines.</p> 
<p>The main idea behind this software if ease of use, it is about making the 
bridge between PC users going to Mac a lot safer and secure. It is a big choice 
switching operating systems and the easier and shorter the process the better 
for the consumer at the end of the day. A way that this has been implemented is 
with two hours worth of video tutorials built into the software with everything 
from installation to getting started with parallels.</p> 
<p>The company gets a lot of its new features from its users. Requests can be

<h1>HOW TO: Tweak Skyrim's Ultra PC graphics and install mods</h1>  By Greg 
Collins on November 16, 2011 Comments (0) <br>

<p></p> 
<p><em>So you have got Skyrim on your PC and it looks good. In fact it looks 
pretty impressive. But for those of you out there with some top-end hardware 
sitting on your desk, you may want to make it look even more glorious as you 
watch the sun set over a high off mountain range, watch the shiny blood gush 
from the open wounds of your enemies, or just have a bit of fun with some mods. 
Whatever the motivation, the following guide will help you tweak your PC 
settings to get the very best ultra graphics package.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Patch Large Address Aware Patch</strong></p> 
<p>Like many Bethesda games, Skyrim is capped to use no more that 2GB of RAM; 
even if you have 12GB the game will reserve the rest for other uses on your 
computer. But if you're playing a game you're unlikely to be doing anything 
else all that intensive. Using a Large Address Aware patch will solve this, 
allowing the game to make full use of your RAM. It's a slightly lengthy process 
but it's the best start to getting the most from the game. Here's how to make 
it work:</p> 
<p><em>- Before making any patches always backup your original exe just in 
case something goes wrong.<br>
 - Download and install CFF explorer (which can 
be found athttp://ntcore.com/exsuite.php)<br>
 - Run the CFF Explorer<br>
 - 
Click the folder icon on the left hand side and browse your PC for TESV.exe.<br>
 - Click on File Header on the left, find Characteristics on the right and 
click the &quot;Click here&quot; button highlighted in blue.<br>
 - Tick 
&quot;App can handle &gt;2GB address space&quot; and click OK<br>
 - Save by 
clicking the disc icon and overwrite the file when prompted</em></p> 
<p>You will need to keep the backup copy of your. exe file that was changed 
with CFF explorer because when you update your game, you will need to copy the 
backup .exe back to the main folder and replace the edited .exe file.</p> 
<p>Locate the folder which has the executable file you changed, delete the 
current .exe file, rename the backup executable back to the original name, and 
then you're ready again to update.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Step 2: Turn off Vsync for better frame rates</strong></p> 
<p>Vysnc is a tool to limit your fps to match the refresh rate of your 
monitor, making sure that your monitor can handle the amount of frames it is 
being given by the graphics card. If you have a high-end card you may want to 
turn off Vsync in order to get a better frame rate from your game.</p> 
<p>Here's how to find and change your Vsync configuration:</p> 
<p><em>- Go to My Documents - My Games - Skyrim (Directories may differ 
depending on your personal install preferences, or if you're playing the game 
through Steam)<br>
 - Locate SKyrimPrefs.ini, make a back-up copy of it, and 
open it with Notepad.<br>
 -Under the heading [Display], insert the line 
'iPresentInterval=0&quot; to switch off Vsync and save the .ini file.</em></p> 
<p>Note that this change can potentially lead to excessive screen tearing. If 
that occurs, just remove the line you added and re-save the file.<br>
<strong>
<br> Step 3: Change shadow settings for trees and land objects</strong></p> 
<p></p> <em><strong>Read Tech Digest's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim review by 
clicking here</strong></em> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>For every tree, rock and flower there is always a shadow to go with it in 
Skyrim,That is, o course, unless you are a nocturnal adventurer. But using this 
tweak to change the shadowing effects on trees and other land objects will 
offer a noticeable improvement to the look of some of the large forest areas of 
the world map:</p> 
<p><em>- Open the SKyrimPrefs.ini again, and again back it up.<br>
 - Under 
the [Display] tab there are two commands that you will need to change to the 
value of 1.<br>
 - For trees, change the line bTreesReceiveShadows=0 to 
bTreesReceiveShadows=1<br>
 - For objects out in the world, change the line 
bDrawLandShadows=0 to bDrawLandShadows=1<br>
 -Save the .ini file, close and 
enjoy!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Step 4: Field of View</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Want to take in more of Skyrim's beautiful settings? Increasing the Field 
of View will increase the angle from which you see the world, giving you a 
wider perspective of your surrounding area and also seeing some more of your 
characters hands and weapons.</p> 
<p>To adjust the field of view, while in game press the '~' to bring up the 
console and enter 'FOV XX'. XX denotes the FOV number you wish to enter. 
Experiment, but from a lot of forum opinions 80-85 seem to do the world 
justice. But it is all down to personal taste, or in this case personal view.
</p> 
<p><strong>Step 5: Install high-res blood textures and a &quot;no 
spiders&quot; mod for arachnophobics</strong> </p> 
<p>For some PC gamers they want to make a game their own by installing mods. 
Some are very simple such as changing blood to a green colour but some are a 
bit more interesting and often down-right hilarious.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One for those who like to admire a kill is the enhanced Blood Textures 
which will improve the resolution of the blood textures in the game, and it one 
of the most noticeable of all the mods.</p> 
<p><em>- Download the file from Skyrimnexus and they will be downloaded as a 
rar. File.<br>
 - If you're not using Windows 7 you will need a programme to 
extract the files<br>
 - Inside the rar. file will be both a data file and a 
&quot;Read me&quot;, and all you have to do is drop the data folder into the 
directory where Skyrim is installed and replace folders when prompted.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Skyrim has a great one for anyone with arachnophobia. The game is full of 
rather large spiders wanting to get their fangs into you but how about 
replacing them with something far less creepy and skin crawling, like bears? 
Replacing every spider in the game with cuddly bears will help with any fears; 
they just want a hug. And your blood too...</p> 
<p>Here's how to install it:</p> 
<p><em>- Download the file from Skyrimnexus and they will be downloaded as a 
rar. File.<br>
 - If you're not using Windows 7 you will need a programme to 
extract the files<br>
 - Inside the rar. file will be both a data file and a 
&quot;Read me&quot;, and all you have to do is drop the data folder into the 
directory where Skyrim is installed and replace folders when prompted.</em></p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Optional: Install MSI Afterburner</strong></p> 
<p>MSI's Afterburner easy overclocking application enables all graphics cards 
to boost their performance and is completely free. If you want to be getting 
the most out of your upgraded card then download the program and toggle the 
settings in order to get the maximum potential from the card. You can control 
everything from core voltages to fan speeds, pushing your card to the max. A 
word of warning though: this can actually burn out your graphics card so is 
really not advised unless you know exactly what you're doing.</p> 
<p>Download MSI Afterburner by clicking here.</p> 
<p>Check below for a quick YouTube guide on how to use the program too, which 
also shows a little about GPU Z, a great tool for monitoring the temperature of 
your system:</p>

<h1>Nvidia 3D Vision 2 revealed: More comfort, better brightness</h1>  By 
Gerald Lynch on October 17, 2011 Comments (3) <br>

<p><br>
 Nvidia have announced the release of their Nvidia 3D Vision 2 kit, 
updating their 3D-for-PC hardware to allow for more comfortable glasses and 
boosting brightness levels for a more vibrant gaming experience.</p> 
<p>The active shutter glasses, paired with an IR emitter that works alongside 
compatible Nvidia graphics cards, now feature 20% larger lenses that feature 
the new LightBoost technology. While the size offers a larger viewing area than 
before, LightBoost boasts 2x brighter 3D images than previous 3D solutions, and 
also improves colour reproduction.</p> 
<p>Environmental is also more prominent with the new glasses, meaning you wont 
have to strain to read your keyboard keys.</p> 
<p>&quot;Gorgeous, bright, crystal-clear 3D worlds are created by Nvidia's 3D 
Vision 2 glasses with 3D LightBoost monitors and notebooks,&quot; said Phil 
Eisler, general manager of 3D Vision at Nvidia.</p> 
<p>&quot;Nvidia's engineering team has made incredible enhancements in 3D on 
PCs, creating a breathtaking gaming experience that's better than the best 
Hollywood 3D movie.&quot;</p> 
<p>So far only the Asus VG278H 27-inch (1920x1080) monitor works with 
LightBoost, though Acer and BenQ models are coming soon, promise Nvidia.</p> 
<p>Launching by the end of the month, the Nvidia 3D Vision 2 kit will be 
available from all major PC retailers for $149, as well as Nvidia's online 
store. Spare pairs of Nvidia 3D Vision 2 glasses, without the IR emitter, will 
be priced at $99.</p> <br>

<h1>REVIEW: Acronis True Image Home 2012</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on October 10, 
2011 Comments (3) <br>

<p><br>
 Name: <strong> Acronis True Image Home 2012</strong></p> <strong> 
</strong> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p>Type: <strong>PC data back-up utility</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p>System requirements: <strong>Click here for full details</strong></p> 
<p>Price: <strong> &pound;39.95 (&pound;23.95 if upgrading from previous 
edition)</strong></p> 
<p><br>
<em>Backing-up PC data can be a chore, but it's a necessary pain if 
you hope to protect your sensitive and precious files from the odd ghost in the 
system. The Acronis True Image Home 2012 suite aims to take the hassle out of 
backing up your files, while also having enough flexibility to sate the 
appetite of even the most avid PC tinkerer. Read on for our verdict.</em><br>

</p> 
<p>Rather than focussing on one form of data back-up, the Acronis True Image 
Home 2012 suite offers the complete package. Be it online back-ups, file-based 
or continuous incremental back-ups of whole drives as they update, drive image 
creation or images of partitions, the software pops all methods into a single 
neat product.</p> 
<p>Whether you're using True Image Home 2012's Nonstop Back-up feature to keep 
your My Documents folder safely duplicated as you pop new files inside, or 
using an Acronis True Image Online account to synchronise local folders with a 
network or a laptop (which follows similar concepts to those that use the 
Dropbox service), there's a solution for pretty much every situation.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It's all presented in such a way as to be make it comfortable to use for 
even those who find the thought of back-up processed intimidating. A re-vamped 
interface opens with a &quot;Get Started&quot;, which offers tutorials on 
&quot;How to back up?&quot;, &quot;When to recover?&quot; and &quot;What is 
sync?&quot;. Whatever your skill level, Acronis have done a fairly good job of 
walking you through each step of each back-up process.</p> 
<p>Of course, if you're familiar with the concepts of preserving your files, 
you can dive straight in with the Backup and recovery&quot; tab and picking 
from options like: &quot;Disk and partition&quot;, &quot;Online&quot;, 
&quot;File&quot;, &quot;Email&quot; and &quot;Nonstop backup&quot;. Again the 
interface is clear, letting you easily pick source and destination locations, 
and in the case of Online and File back-up processes, offering check-box style 
controls to select the precise files that need copying.</p> 
<p>It's all highly configurable too, letting you set back-up schedules, 
password protect resulting archives and (in the case of the online back-up 
tools) set network bandwidth limits so that your uploads to the Acronis servers 
don't totally drain your internet speeds. Archives are created in manageable 
sizes, and the True Image Home 2012 processes can run happily in the background 
without hogging too much of your system's resources. The program had a few 
issues recognising a Crucial solid-state drive we were testing with that hadn't 
been assigned a drive letter, but it's a problem that seemed unique to our 
set-up.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Those looking for very specific back-up tools will be pleased to discover 
True Home Image 2012's Email Back-up and Try&amp;Decide tools. Outlook users in 
particular will benefit from Email Back-Up, letting you quickly and effectively 
archive all inbox messages and contacts, saving invaluable stuff in the case of 
a disaster be you a business owner working from home or simply a person who'd 
simply die if they lost their email-archived holiday snaps. Try&amp;Decide was 
our personal favourite tool, letting you road-test risky installations (say a 
work-in-progress driver or a download from an untrusted source) and then revert 
back quickly and simply to a prior state if you encounter any problems.</p> 
<p>These are among a long list of features already present in previous 
versions of True Image Home 2012. Managing all these options could potentially 
become a pain, but again a clear UI means that it's simply a matter of checking 
a list in the Back-up and Recovery tab to keep on top of everything lined up.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>While the computer whiz-kids amongst us will already have 
fool-proof methods for manually creating back-up copies of their valuable 
files, True Image Home 2012 makes the whole process much simpler for newbies. 
There's also enough smart features (like Try and Decide) to make even those 
with their own tried-and-tested back-up methods consider giving this a try. 
It's not without its quirks, and the full suite of online support isn't the 
most competitively priced, but it comes strongly recommended nonetheless..

<h1>Incoming HP CEO will have a $1 salary</h1>  By Gerald Lynch on September 
30, 2011 Comments (6) <br>

<p>In these hard economic times, we're all having to make a few sacrifices. 
I'm now eating Tesco's own-brand caviar, and have managed to cut down to just 
four bottles of champagne a week. HP's new CEO Meg Whitman is feeling the 
monetary burn too; she's taken the post with just a base salary of $1.</p> 
<p>The former eBay CEO, replacing Leo Apotheker, was brought in following 
Apotheker's claims that HP were looking to sell off its hardware arm.</p> 
<p>That low wage isn't to say Whitman wont make a pretty penny from her new 
post. Her &quot;compensation package&quot; will offer plenty of room to earn 
significant bonuses, as well as the opportunity to nab 1.9 million shares in HP 
through the company's 2004 stock incentive plan.</p> 
<p>Regardless, a $1 salary has become a somewhat-lucky figure in tech circles. 
Steve Jobs of Apple also famously took just a dollar for his wage when he was 
9-to-5 at Apple. Things worked out pretty well for them, wouldn't you say?</p>

<h1>Personnel Management: a new way of thinking with HR self-service software
</h1>  By shinychris on September 23, 2011 <br>

<p></p> 
<p><strong>Sponsored post</strong></p> 
<p>It is impossible for companies to continue to remain stuck in their old way 
of doing things, when it comes to Human Resources and personnel management. The 
world is a very fast paced place and with the ever increasing need for all 
things to be done at speed, HR has had to move with the times.</p> 
<p>Some companies are being left behind, some are flying ahead on the wings 
ever-developing technology and others are beginning to understand that a 
diverse modern workforce can do an awful lot for themselves in terms of keeping 
their personal details up to date.</p> 
<p>The term for such <strong>HR software </strong>is self-service HR. 
Employees are provided with access to enable them to update their personal 
details or request leave for instance. This enables HR employees to spend time 
on more on effective HR requirements and gives other employees more control of 
their personal details data.</p> 
<p>The overall benefits of a self-service HR function reduces the number of 
errors that can occur in terms of change of address for example and more 
importantly reduces dramatically the amount of paper work that can at times 
swamp HR departments. Self-service HR software also provides an effective 
method for management to access employee's individual data and to monitor such 
things as holiday leave, sickness absence and can be an effective tool to 
conduct appraisal or performance reviews.</p> 
<p>Self-service HR software does not in any way reduce the amount of control 
management has over the overall HR records - employees will only be provided 
access to relevant data input areas of the HR record, management can securely 
extract report data that may be required and can also input secure data 
themselves, restricting some data entry from employee access.</p> 
<p>The restriction of access operates through a system of access privilege 
levels. For example a member of staff could place a request for holiday leave 
at one level of the system and authorisation for the leave would occur at 
management level, accessed via management privilege. Very efficient, very 
secure and extremely effective in terms of employee time!</p> 
<p>How does a self-service HR system operate when such things as a holiday 
request requires approval - quite simply the system utilises an e-mail alert 
system. The holiday request generates an e-mail alert to line management - once 
authorised the employee receives an e-mail alert to indicate authorisation.</p> 
<p>It is so efficient that the older ways of authorising holiday leave cannot 
be comprehended. The holiday record sheet, filling out the dates, sending the 
paperwork to HR, waiting for the form to be returned on and on and on. Fast and 
efficient self-service HR software is now the way of the world for leading edge 
businesses. For forward looking companies it is a progressive process and for 
organisations with paper based HR functions it has got to be something they 
must consider. HR self-service software is the way forward. It's not just a 
method of company progression, it is a way to empower a diverse workforce.</p>
