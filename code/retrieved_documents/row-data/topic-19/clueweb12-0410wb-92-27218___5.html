If you have not yet read the other pages in the 
series, it is strongly recommended that you do so. Mainly, everything previous 
to this page covers the basic differences in Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X operating 
system use, and also reviews Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X media capabilities. At this 
point, it's quite clear that Windows 7 andMac OS X are quite similar to each 
other. Each respective operating system offers an alterantive to the 
competitor, even for photo editing and video editing.
<p></p> 
<p>Is one operating system better for everyday use? Not necessarily. Picking a 
winner between the two operating systems is quickly becoming a controversial 
topic. To better understand the major differences in the Mac vs. PC battle, be 
sue to check out the other series articles. There will be links for them at the 
bottom of this page.</p> 
<p>Other than what is already covered, there are some more technical aspects 
of each operating system, which we will cover next.</p> <br>

<h2>Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X - Technical Differences</h2> 
<p><strong></strong></p> <strong>  click to enlarge <br>
</strong> <strong>
Windows 7</strong>utilizes a major program format of .EXE. For example, if you 
download and install a new program on your PC, it will almost always be of .EXE 
format. Aside from the name .EXE, there is not much that else to it.
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Mac OS X </strong>utilizes a major program format of .App. So, if 
you download and install a new program on your Mac, it will almost certainly be 
a .App file. Aside from the file extension name .App, there is not much else to 
it. .App is a Mac format.</p> 
<p>.App's typically do not work on Windows PCs, and .EXE's typically do not 
work on Macs, at least not by default.</p> 
<p>Above, it was mentioned that .EXE and .App are the major file formats for 
installing programs and applications on Macs and PCs.</p>  click to enlarge <br>
However, Macs and PCs use some common file formats as well. For example, 
compression formats.
<p></p> 
<p>You may download a Zip file or RAR file on a Windows computer, which will 
need to be extracted to get to the files. Macs are essentially the same, as 
they use the compressed Zip and RAR format as well.</p> <br>

<p>You can run Windows apps on a Mac using VMware Fusion, other virtualization 
software, or BootCamp.</p> 
<h2>Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X - UNIX</h2> 
<p></p>  click to enlarge <br>
Mac OS X is a UNIX based operating system, 
which to say the most, is a bit more technical than most people would care for. 
Basically, UNIX involves the platform on which an operating system is built, 
how it functions, and the coding behind it.
<p></p> 
<p>Windows is not UNIX based, and has it's own unique build. Many people will 
say that UNIX is a more secure platform, but that is much of an opinion. 
Microsoft likes to come out with many of it's own standards. For example, .NET
and Silverlight.</p> 
<p>However, Apple does the same thing.</p> 
<h2>Windows 7 vs. Mac OS X - Conclusion</h2> 
<p></p>  click to enlarge <br>
This article was mainly written to note some 
differences between general Mac vs. PC equivalents. Both Mac OS andWindows 7 
are very different, but very alike as well. For everyday computer use, Mac OS X 
is really not that difficult to get used to, if you are switching from PC. 
Alternatively, Windows 7 is not that difficult to get used to if you are 
switching from Mac. Check out some of the recommended series articles below, as 
they detail more about Windows and Mac OS X. For example, many consider Macs to 
be more simple, but Windows PCs to be more powerful.
