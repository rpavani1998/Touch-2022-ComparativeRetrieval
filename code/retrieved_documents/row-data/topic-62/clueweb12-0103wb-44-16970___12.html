<p>Cardboard and Plastics </p> 
<p>Cardboard&nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions </p> 
<p><strong>1. What types of cardboard can I recycle?<br>
</strong>You can 
recycle all cardboard packaging such as cardboard boxes, cereal boxes, ready 
meal sleeves, egg boxes and toilet roll tubes.&nbsp; Please put greeting cards 
in your green box and brown paper in your blue bag.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Why do cardboard and brown&nbsp;have to be collected separately 
from the rest of the paper?</strong><br>
If cardboard and brown paper get mixed 
with the&nbsp;rest of the paper (newspapers, magazines etc.) it may be rejected 
by the paper mill because it leaves brown spots that spoil the finished product.
</p> 
<p><strong>3. Can I put food and drinks cartons (Tetra Paks) in with my 
recycling?</strong><br>
Yes,&nbsp;you can now put them in your blue bag. Please 
wash and squash and remove plastic&nbsp;lids if possible. You can also take 
them&nbsp;to one of the five recycling banks in Bath and North East 
Somerset.&nbsp; To find out more, please go toRecycling Banks.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Do I have to remove the tape and plastics that comes with my 
cardboard?</strong><br>
Yes please.&nbsp; Make sure that you remove ALL 
plastic, tape and polystyrene as these can't be recycled and will contaminate 
the cardboard.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Can I still put cardboard out for my composting collection?<br>

</strong>No.&nbsp; We no longer take cardboard for composting so please use 
your weekly recycling collection instead.</p> 
<p><strong>6. What size are the blue bags?</strong><br>
The bags are 45cm 
cubed with a capacity of 91 litres.</p> 
<p><strong>7. How do I get a bag?</strong><br>
To order a bag please contact 
Council Connectcouncilconnect@bathnes.gov.uk 01225 39 40 41.&nbsp; Please note, 
we will only&nbsp;issue one bag per household.</p> 
<p><strong>8. What if I have too much cardboard for the blue bag?</strong><br>

You need to pack your cardboard flat so that it fits into the blue bag - it can 
easily hold a large amount of cardboard.&nbsp; Extra cardboard can be placed 
out for collection in untied carrier bags or tied with string.&nbsp; It cannot 
be put loose in the green box.&nbsp; All card must be folded or cut so that it 
is no bigger than 45 cm so that it can fit on the vehicle.</p> 
<p><strong>9. Can I put cardboard out if I don't have a blue bag?</strong><br>

Yes.&nbsp; You can still put cardboard out provided that you pack it flat and 
keep it separate from the paper - see question 8.</p> 
<p><strong>10. I have lots of cardboard because I run a business from home - 
why won't you take it all?</strong><br>
Cardboard that is generated as a result 
of a business activity can be collected for a charge.&nbsp; Council tax payers 
do not subsidise the recycling or disposal of business waste.&nbsp; Please 
contact Council Connect for details of our business waste recycling service or 
see&nbsp;Commercial Waste.</p> 
<p><strong>11. Can I put cardboard and brown paper in my green box?</strong>
<br>No.&nbsp; We only collect cardboard and brown paper that is in the blue box 
or presented separately to avoid the risk of it becoming mixed with the rest of 
the paper.&nbsp; Cardboard and brown paper contaminate the paper because they 
leave brown spots in the finished product.</p> 
<p><strong>12. Can I use my blue bag for putting other recyclable items in?
</strong><br>
No.&nbsp; You must only use your blue bag for cardboard and brown 
paper.&nbsp; If you need more space you can put your recycling out in carrier 
bags or request an extra container from Council Connect
councilconnect@bathnes.gov.uk 01225 39 40 41.</p> 
<p><strong>13. Is there a smaller sized blue bag available?</strong><br>

No.&nbsp; For the introduction of this new service we are only offering one 
size of blue bag.&nbsp; We will monitor how it all works, how much is going in 
the blue bags and whether a different size is also needed for people who only 
have small quantities of cardboard.&nbsp; Remember you only need to put out the 
blue bag with cardboard when there's enough in it - not every week.</p> 
<p><strong>14. Won't the bag blow away?</strong><br>
The bag has a weighted 
base to reduce the chance of it blowing away and the recycling collectors will 
make sure that they leave it inside your green box after collection.</p> 
<p><strong>15. How is the cardboard recycled?<br>
</strong>The cardboard is 
made back into cardboard packaging.</p> 
<p><strong>16. Why can the cardboard no longer be composted?</strong><br>
The 
composting sites were finding increasingly that cardboard was not being 
composted successfully and quality of the compost was not as good as it could 
be.&nbsp; The composting facilities were increasingly having to sort the 
cardboard out of the green waste to get rid of any contaminants.&nbsp; This was 
becoming a costly way of processing the cardboard waste and the end results 
were not as good as expected.</p> 
<p><strong>17. I live in flats and have a </strong><strong>Mini Recycling 
Centre</strong><strong> (MRC).&nbsp; Can I recycle cardboard here?</strong><br>

Unfortunately the blue bag collection is not suitable for flats where you have 
your own MRCs but we are currently installing wheelie bins for cardboard 
recycling at most mini recycling centres.&nbsp; Cardboard can also be taken to 
one of our threeRecycling Centres for recycling.</p> 
<p>Plastic&nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions </p> 
<p><strong>1. What types of plastic can I recycle?</strong><br>
You can 
recycle all types of solid household plastic food and drink packaging such as:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>tubs (eg ice-cream and margarine tubs) </li> 
<li>pots (eg yoghurt pots) </li> 
<li>trays (eg meat and fruit trays) </li> 
<li>bottles (eg. milk bottles, washing up bottles)</li> </ul> 
<p>Please go to Additional Plastic Frequently Asked Questions to find out 
about the types of plastic that we cannot recycle.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Why does the plastic need to be clean?</strong><br>
Dirty 
plastic can be unhygienic, unpleasant and unsafe to handle. It can also 
contaminate the other materials, which means we might not be able to recycle 
them.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Can I recycle the plastic lids from bottles?<br>
</strong>Yes. 
Please wash and squash plastic bottles to save space on our vehicles.You can 
put the lids back on bottles if they are squashed flat.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Can I mix plastic bottles and plastic food packaging together?
<br></strong>Yes.&nbsp; Please make sure they are clean.&nbsp; You can also mix 
them with the cans but please keep them separate from the rest of your 
recycling.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Why can I mix cans and plastic together when&nbsp;I have to 
separate everything else?</strong><br>
Cans and plastic can be mixed together 
because the cans are then separated from the plastic using magnets.&nbsp; All 
the other materials need to be separated beforehand so they can be put into 
separate containers on our vehicles.</p> 
<p><strong>6. What if I don't have any more space in my green box?</strong><br>
If you need an additional container please contact Council Connect
councilconnect@bathnes.gov.uk 01225 39 40 41.&nbsp; You can also put your 
recycling out in any suitable container such as plastic carrier bags or a 
plastic box.</p> 
<p><strong>7. Should I squash my plastic before I put it out?</strong><br>
Yes 
please.&nbsp; If you can squash your plastic it helps to saves room and means 
we can fit more on the vehicle.&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is to stamp on 
it.</p> 
<p><strong>8. How is the plastic recycled?</strong><br>
The plastic is 
recycled into a variety of products from drainage pipes, park benches and waste 
bins to fleece jackets and food grade packaging.</p> 
<p><strong>9. Why can't you take plastic film?<br>
</strong>These are 
difficult for the sorting machines to separate and we do not have an 
established market that makes it cost effective to collect this material.</p> 
<p><strong>10. Why can't you take black plastic?</strong><br>
There is no 
established market for black plastic.&nbsp; This cannot be recycled currently.
</p> 
<p><strong>11. Why can't you take other plastic items such as toys?</strong>
<br>Other types of plastic are difficult to collect and to sort and they also 
may contain non-plastic items.</p> 
<p><strong>12. Can I recycle plant pots?</strong><br>
No.&nbsp; We cannot 
collect plant pots but some local garden centres will collect these for reuse 
or recycling.Here are details of a few, but we would advise you to ring and 
check first&nbsp;to ensure that this information is still current.&nbsp;</p>
