<p><strong>House Plant Care - Getting Back to Basics:</strong><br>
</p> 
<p>Indoor plants are fabulous! They add color, greenery, life &amp; a bit of 
the tropics to any home. Yet, questions abound about the failure of indoor 
plants. Although we at Botanicus only take care of Commercial accounts now, we 
started in 1971as the Plant Parlour WNY's first plants-only retail store! We 
were well known for providing great plant care tips &amp; advice! Here is a 
portion of our expert advice from over 30 years of taking care of plants:</p> 
<p><strong>To better understand how to grow indoor plants, you must understand 
how plants grow!</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Plants produce sugar for 
growing in a process called photosynthesis. To photosynthesize plantsneed water 
as well as light on their leaves (where a molecule called chlorophyll caries 
out the process). All plants require different amounts of light to actually 
photosynthesize -- survive and grow, some plants will thrive in a certain area 
where other types of plants will die. Just like you,plants can be sunburned by 
direct sun outdoors when they are not use to it.</p> 
<p>The stems are the vascular system for the plant, and can be compared to the 
veins and arteries of the human body.Within the stem are two different vascular 
bundles.The xylem carries water and<strong></strong>nutrients up from the roots 
(arteries) to the leaves, the phloem carries sugars, starches, and hormones 
produced in the leaves back to the roots (veins). The pulse up and down the 
stem is critical to healthy plant growth. The pulse working properly is 
dependent upon strong healthy roots, proper lighting levels and good air 
movement. The &ldquo;pulse rate&rdquo; of a plant is regulated by the water 
used by the leaves (transpiration). This rate is increased by more sunlight, 
more air movement, warmer temperatures, and low humidity and is slowed by lower 
lighting, stale air, cooler temperatures and high humidity (terrariums). Just 
as with the human body &ldquo;the pulse rate&rdquo; should be regulated 
properly by environmental conditions to ensure health.<br>
</p> 
<p>The roots are the lifeline for the plant.&nbsp; They supply needed moisture 
and nutrients for the leaves to produce food during photosynthesis.&nbsp; They 
also store energy and food for the plant.&nbsp;They provide stability. Plants 
grow in a balanced way, as they make new roots, new leaves form. If roots are 
not encouraged to grow, no new foliage will occur. In 90 percent of cases, 
plant failure can be attributed to lack of healthy roots or to root 
damage.&nbsp; Roots can be damaged in many ways: roots suffocate in soggy 
compacted soil, roots die if the soil is too dry for too long, disease, etc. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The secret to healthy plants is a light, soilless potting mix toencourage 
actively growingroots! &nbsp;Indoor plants are tropical plants and require a 
different soil than in the ground here in WNY. Commercial &quot;potting 
soil&quot; is<strong></strong>ordinarily unsuitable for indoor plants. It is 
not reliably sterile (causing diseases and even sometimes weeds) and is too 
dense.&nbsp; The dense nature of most commercial potting soils keep roots too 
wet for long periods and do not encourage good root growth.&nbsp; Studies have 
shown much more rigorous root growth in a light, soilless medium.&nbsp; This 
extra-porous formula has excellent moisture-holding capacity to provide the 
perfect environment for vigorous rooting.&nbsp;It is ideal for all kinds of 
potted plants &ndash; perfect for spouting seeds and for rooting 
cuttings.&nbsp; In it plants grow sturdy and strong.&nbsp; You can even grow 
containers of annual flowers outdoors in this soil (although with this light 
mix you may need to add gravel or rocks in the pot to prevent the wind from 
blowing the pot over!)&nbsp; You can make &ldquo;Cornell Mix&rdquo; at home 
with easily available materials: 2/3 peat moss and 1/3 perlite.&nbsp; If the 
potting medium is difficult to wet at first, fill a plastic grocery bag and add 
one cup of hot water and seal for 24 hours.</p> 
<p><strong>Light Requirements</strong><strong></strong><br>
 All plants 
require different amounts of light to photosynthesize&nbsp; (manufacture food) 
and grow. Quantity and quality of light available indoors is significantly less 
than light in nature. Window size, distance from the window (to the side or 
under), the presence of curtains or shades, partial obstructions (awnings, 
overhangs, trees, etc.) influence the amount of light your plant receives. Our 
light code is a guide for your plants, and should be adjusted to seasonal 
variations and individual locations. In Buffalo, it&rsquo;s virtually 
impossible to give any plant indoors too much light, so plants in the lower 
light categories will grow in the higher light areas (although they may need 
more watering and fertilizer).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>FULL SUN - Unobstructed south, southeast, or southwest window that receives 
direct sunlight for at least half&nbsp; the day. No curtains or shades. Plant 
should be directly in window (if plant is greater than 2 feet back, this is not 
Full Sun even if sunbeams are striking the plant) (1200-5000 footcandles). 
Plants that like this:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Floor plants:&nbsp; Most Palms, Orange Trees </li>

<p>****Below 75 footcandles, even low-light plants have trouble thriving.</p> 
<p><strong>Proper Watering</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Incorrect watering 
is a common factor in plant failure. Roots suffocate in soggy compacted soil. 
Plants die if they do not get enough water. When a plant needs water, water it 
thoroughly until water comes out the bottom of the pot (if in a drained 
container). Make sure the soil is saturated and the excess is drained away. Do 
not allow a plant to sit in water for a long period of time. Check your plants 
often. Water only those that show the need for water with room temperature 
water. Do not use water that has been chemically softened, as it is toxic to 
plants.</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plants that need to stay moist should be 
watered as soon as the surface of the soil<br>
 is dry to the touch.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Plants in small pots (&lt;4&rdquo; diameter) especially in sunny windows 
</li> 
<li>Hanging Plants: Boston Fern, Piggybacks, Gesneriads, asparagus fern, 
variegated english ivy, English Ivy, swedish ivy, Ferns</li> 
<li>Table plants: Babies Tears, Ferns, Orchids </li> </ul> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plants that need to dry moderately should 
be watered when the soil is dry about<br>
 1/4 of the way through the pot.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Floor plants:&nbsp; Aglaonema (Chinese Evergreen),&nbsp; Aspidistra (cast 
iron Plant),<br>

Violets, Babies Tears, Bromeliads, Ferns, Orchids, all cacti, jerusalem cherry, 
Succulents</li> </ul> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plants that need to dry completely should 
be watered when the soil is dry 3/4<br>
 of the way through the pot.</p> 
<p><strong>Fertilizing</strong><br>
 Plant growth is dependant upon a steady 
supply of nutrients! The nutrients in any soil are soon depleted.<br>
<strong>
</strong><br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
 Plants need soluble fertilizers at one-half the recommended dose, 
fertilize every 3rd to 4th watering during the summer months. During Fall and 
Winter, fertilize every 2-3 months. Time-release fertilizer may be mixed into 
the potting medium when repotting. Never water a very dry plant with fertilizer!
</p> 
<p><strong>Repotting</strong><br>
 A common mistake of most beginners is to 
repot plants long before it is necessary.&nbsp; Roots growing out of the bottom 
of the pot do not necessarily mean that the plant needs repotting. If the plant 
is lifting out of the pot, or if inspection of the root system show that there 
is no room for root growth, then the plant should be repotted. Spring is the 
best time to repot indoor plants. Repotting then will ensure more new growth 
and less frequent watering during the hot, sunny summer.</p> 
<p>To see if a plant needs repotting: Carefully knock them out of them out of 
their containers.&nbsp; If they retain a pot shape and no soil falls away, pot 
in a container 1-3 inches bigger (diameter).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Be sure to use a light, soilless mix for repotting.&nbsp; Commercial 
&quot;potting soil&quot; is ordinarily unsuitable for indoor plants. It is not 
reliably sterile and is too dense. A potting medium for indoor plants should be 
moisture retentive, well drained, and sterile. A mixture of two-thirds sphagnum 
peat moss and one-third perlite is an ideal medium for growing indoor plants.
</p> 
<p>Carefully knock the plant out of its old pot (do not pull on the 
plant).&nbsp; Remove any loose soil especially if it is a heavy mix. If you are 
repotting into a undrained container, put a layer of perlite (1-2 inches in 
small containers and more in larger) at the bottom as a drainage layer (to 
prevent roots from sitting in water).&nbsp; Place enough soil in the bottom of 
the pot to have the top of the root ball near the top of the container (~1 inch 
below in small containers ~3&rdquo; below in large). Set the plant in the pot 
and gently pack soil arrond the root ball with your fingers.&nbsp; Thoroughly 
water the plant until all of the soil is moist and water drains out the 
bottom.&nbsp;(In an undrained container fill with water, wait a few minutes and 
them carefully tip on its side to completely drain the excess water out.)</p> 
<p><strong>Insects</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Insects can come from 
outdoors or other plants. Flying stages, airborne eggs or brushing an infected 
plant exposes other plants. The best defense against insects is to keep your 
plants healthy.&nbsp; Check your plants often to find insects early; pay 
particular attention to the backs of leaves, and internodes. If an insect 
population is found, wash&nbsp;thoroughly with warm water and a mild 
dishwashing liquid and rinse foliage thoroughly, twice a week for 2-3 weeks. If 
insecticide is necessary, call your local garden center for recommendations. 
Make sure that plants are moist before application. Always read the 
instructions before applying any chemical.&nbsp; You may wish to take a 
pro-active approach and thoroughly wash your plants regularly as well as 
washing any new plants.</p> 
<p><strong>Cleaning</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Remove the dust from plant 
leaves periodically; otherwise plants can&rsquo;t breath or grow 
properly.&nbsp;You can clean many plants quickly by putting them under your 
bathroom shower.&nbsp; Use only lukewarm unsoftened water. To avoid washing the 
soil out of the pot, wrap a plastic sheet around the base of the plant and over 
the pot.&nbsp;After their shower, let plants drip-dry before taking them back 
to their accustomed locations.&nbsp; If chemical residue in the water leaves 
white spots, remove them with a clean soft cloth.<br>
 Large-leaved plants can 
be easily cleaned by wiping the leaves with a damp cloth.&nbsp; Support the 
underside of the leaf with one hand while gently wiping the upper side with the 
cloth.&nbsp; To remove dust from hairy-leaved plants such as African violets 
and gloxinia, rub gently with a dry cotton swab or a pipe cleaner. A watercolor 
brush works well for this job, too.</p> 
<p><strong>Shaping plants - Pinching &amp; Pruning</strong><strong></strong>
<br> A little judicious trimming will keep your plants the size you want.&nbsp; 
Without pruning and pinching, a plant can become a tall and leggy 
eyesore.&nbsp;For slow growing plants the best time to shape in spring (May or 
June when it just starts to grow) or just after flowering.<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Pinching</strong>.&nbsp;Pinching off the tip growth of a branch 
encourages side branches to develop, which results in a thicker, bushier 
plant.&nbsp; No tools are necessary for this simple operation; just use your 
thumb and index finger.&nbsp; New branches generally arise from buds at the 
bases of the remaining leaves.&nbsp; Pinching improves the shapes of many 
plants, such as wax begonias, gardenias, and aucuba, which branch out normally. 
Single-leader plants(plant has one stem - does not branch) such as 
dieffenbachia, rubber tree, and dracena, shouldn&rsquo;t be pinched (but can be 
air-layored).</p> 
<p><strong>Pruning</strong>. Often a major branch must be removed, either to 
keep the plant the size you want or to improve its shape. Study the plant 
carefully before cutting off all or part of a major branch.&nbsp; Use clippers 
to get a smooth cut, and make the cut just above a growth bud.&nbsp; The best 
times to prune a plant are when it is in active growth (usually in the spring) 
or soon after it has bloomed. Some plants such as true Palms have only one 
growth point and trimming the top will kill the plant.</p> 
<p><strong>Containers</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Which is better a clay 
pot, a plastic pot, a ceramic pot, an undrained container, or a pot with 
drainage holes and a saucer?&nbsp; Many indoor gardens attribute the success of 
failure of their plants to the type of container used for growing!&nbsp; 
Instead, look to the type of potting mixture being used and your watering 
habits.&nbsp;90% of plants having problems are due to the nature of the growing 
medium.&nbsp; Most commercial potting soils are too dense, tend to compact and 
inhibit new root growth.&nbsp; Instead of being concerned that a pot 
&ldquo;breathes&rdquo; look for a loose porous potting mix that allows roots 
oxygen.&nbsp; (See above for more info)<br>
<br>
 Plants grown in clay will 
need watering much more frequently.&nbsp; In winter you must be careful for 
clay pots conduct the cold and can chill the roots.&nbsp; Clay pots will also 
need regular cleaning to keep free of algae and salt residue.&nbsp;Much more 
maintenance will be necessary in clay pots.<br>
<br>
 Plastic pots and ceramic 
pots will hold more moisture freeing you from watering.&nbsp; They are 
especially good for plants that like to stay moist &ndash; eg ferns, ivies, and 
babies tears.&nbsp; They also do not need such frequent cleaning as clay.&nbsp; 
Ceramic pots often are not glazed on the bottom and can leave moisture-marks on 
furniture and carpets.<br>
<br>
 The only problem with an undrained pot is that 
excess water is not removed automatically.&nbsp; Even with good drainage 
material like perlite at the bottom, excess water should be removed after 
watering by holding the plant at an angle with a hand over the soil so none 
falls out.<br>
<br>
 Remember, any pot can grow a gorgeous plant, the secret is 
the soil &ndash; and your care holds the key to success!</p> 
<p><strong>Moving Plants Cold weather (&lt;50&deg;F)</strong><br>
 Tropical 
plants brighten the indoors and add to our homes.&nbsp; However, one should be 
aware that these plants do not like the cold and will suffer damage from even 
brief exposure to air near freezing.&nbsp; When transporting them in winter (or 
any day when the temperature is below 50&deg;!), it is important that plants be 
carefully wrapped.&nbsp; Wrap small plants in newspaper (roll pot to make a 
tube and fold over the excess paper at the top).&nbsp;Place larger plants (or 
several newspapered small plants) in a large plastic garbage bag.&nbsp; Blow 
into the bag to create a bubble of warm air and seal the bag tightly.&nbsp; 
Warm your car up and move your plants directly from the heated house to the 
heated car.&nbsp; Drive straight to your plant&rsquo;s new home.&nbsp; Plants 
cannot be left in an unheated vehicle. Remember that plants left in plastic 
bags in the sun may overheat!<br>
<br>
 At your new location, make sure to 
place plants in enough light and adjust your watering as needed.</p> 
<p><strong>Warm weather </strong><br>
 The key when moving plants in warm 
weather is to protect them from direct sun or excess heat.&nbsp;Plants left in 
the sun (even for a few minutes) will sunburn from the sun&rsquo;s ultra-violet 
rays that window glass screens out.&nbsp; If necessary, plants can be left 
outside for a while in deep shade under a large tree.<br>
<br>
 Just as your 
car heats up on sunny summer days, enclosed trucks can also get very hot 
inside.&nbsp;Plants will be damaged in heat above 100&deg; (easily reached in 
closed vehicles in the sun<strong>even in spring</strong> ) and any part of the 
plant that is touching glass or metal will be burned at much lower 
temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that plants left in plastic bags in the sun 
may overheat!<br>
<br>
 To prevent soil messes: wrap small plants in newspaper 
(roll pot to make a tube and fold over the excess paper at the top).<br>
<br>
 
Your best bet is to load your plants last into an enclosed vehicle (indoor 
plants will not survive highway speeds in an open truck!), drive directly to 
your destination, and unload the plants first and take directly inside.&nbsp; 
At your new location, make sure to place plants in enough light and adjust your 
watering as needed.</p> 
<p><strong>Vacation Tips</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Suggestions for 
maintaining your plants while you&rsquo;re gone&hellip;&nbsp; The first four 
methods are recommended for plants being left alone for not more than ten days, 
for longer trips consider 5&amp;6.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Larger Plants that would not dry out more than once during your absence 
should be watered thoroughly just before you leave.</li> 
<li>Plants which normally require watering every few days can be moved away 
from sunny windows and into bright but indirect light.&nbsp; This will slow 
down the plant&rsquo;s use of water.&nbsp; Try this method before you leave to 
get an indication of just how far it will stretch the plant&rsquo;s drying-out 
time.</li> 
<li>Those plants which need to be watered frequently can be enclosed (pot and 
all) in clear plastic bags.&nbsp; Punch a few holes in the bag to provide a 
small amount of circulation.&nbsp; It is essential to move these plants away 
from sunny locations and into bright INDIRECT light.&nbsp; This will avoid 
heating up the inside of the plastic bags and &ldquo;frying&rdquo; the plants.
</li> 
<li>If your bathroom is fairly bright, you can use the &ldquo;bathtub 
method.&rdquo; Place your plants on bricks in the tub, fill the tub with an 
inch or two of water (not enough to reach the top of the bricks), set your 
plants on the bricks, and cover the bathtub with clear plastic.</li> 
<li>Consider asking a friend to plant-sit.&nbsp; But: Do not ask a friend who 
doesn&rsquo;t have plants of his/her own; the lack of experience could prove 
fatal to your plants.&nbsp; Choose only one person to look after your plants, 
and leave complete instructions with that person.&nbsp; If possible, move 
inaccessible plants into easy to reach locations, and if you have plants 
scattered throughout the house, make carefully complied list of every plant and 
its location.&nbsp;Special collections (bonsai, orchids&hellip;) should be 
given to the care of a fellow collector, if at all possible.</li> 
<li>As a last resort (in summer only!), larger house plants can be placed 
outside (pot and all) in the ground on the north side of your house, and left 
in the care of Mother Nature.</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Seasonal Tips <br>
 May</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Longer, 
sunny days bring accelerated growth and an increasing need for moisture to 
indoor plants. By May, all of your plants should be actively growing.&nbsp; Any 
that are not should be knocked out of their pots for a thorough inspection of 
the roots.&nbsp; A tangled mass of white or light brown roots signals the need 
for a slightly larger pot.&nbsp; We strongly recommend the use of 
&ldquo;Cornell Mix&rdquo; soilless potting medium for all indoor plants.&nbsp; 
Begin fertilizing a week or so after the plant is repotted or use timed-release 
fertilizer (according to the directions) in the potting mix. Regular 
application of plant food results in stronger, healthier, and fuller 
plants.&nbsp; This is the best time of year to trim plants that have grown out 
of shape.&nbsp;Trim of pinch tips of branches liberally to encourage dense, 
compact growth.&nbsp; Usually this repotting, trimming, and fertilizing will 
totally revitalize a fading specimen.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Summer</strong><br>
 June is an important month for all your indoor 
plants.&nbsp; Before you get busy with outdoor work, try to be sure to do the 
following so your indoor plants can have the benefits of highly active summer 
growth.<br>
<br>
 Fertilizing &ndash; Plants really need a steady supply of 
nutrients through the active growing season.&nbsp;Your plants depend on you for 
these nutrients.&nbsp; Use any good fertilizer one/half the recommended 
strength every two weeks.&nbsp; Be careful to never fertilize plants that are 
dry &ndash; better to water thoroughly, wait 24-48 hours, then apply 
fertilizer.&nbsp; With regular feeding your plants will grow 100% better!<br>

<br> Watering &ndash; With summer&rsquo;s warm temperatures, good air movement 
(open windows and doors) and increased sunlight, plants will use water at a 
much faster rate.&nbsp; Plants outdoors or in open windows should be checked 
very often (even daily) for watering.&nbsp; Be sure to really soak your plants 
thoroughly, be sure to repot is necessary and use plastic pots (instead of clay 
pots) for plants that like to stay moist.<br>
<br>
 Repotting &ndash; 
now&rsquo;s the time to check all your plants for repotting.&nbsp; Carefully 
knock them out of them out of their containers.&nbsp; If they retain a pot 
shape and no soil falls away, pot in a container 1-3 inches bigger 
(diameter).&nbsp; Be sure to use a light, soilless mix for repotting, changing 
soil if it is not.&nbsp; Repotting now will ensure more new growth and less 
frequent watering.<br>
<br>
 Consider summering your houseplants outside!&nbsp; 
This is a nice addition to porches and other garden areas and can help some 
plants increase in size.&nbsp; A few words of warning:&nbsp; Some houseplants 
are more cold-sensitive that others (as often noticed by Buffaloians in cold 
winters).&nbsp; These plants may die or exhibit leaf damage should the 
nighttime temperatures drop below 50&deg;F.&nbsp; Until temperatures are 
reliably above 50&deg;F (after June 1 in Buffalo) the following should not be 
left outdoors overnight: Dracena, Schefflera, many types of Aralia, and 
Gesneriads.<br>
<br>
 Plants outdoors are exposed to the sun&rsquo;s 
ultra-violet rays.&nbsp; Window glass screens out these rays.&nbsp; Since our 
indoor plants are not accustomed to UV rays, they will sunburn if put directly 
out into the sun.&nbsp; Acclimate your plants to UV rays by placing them in 
heavy shade for one to two weeks before moving into the direct sunlight.&nbsp; 
Some particular types of plants prefer to be left in the shade outdoors: they 
tend to shed sun-grown leaves when brought back inside in the fall. Included in 
this category are Ficus species (eg Weeping Fig, Rubber Tree) and Schefflera.
<br> <br>
 Increased sunlight and air movement results in faster rates of water 
use.&nbsp; Check plants outside at least once every day.&nbsp; Plants which 
have very thin leaves, such as ferns, will usually do better if left indoors or 
in shade outdoors.</p> 
<p><strong>September</strong><br>
 It&rsquo;s time to think about bringing in 
the plants you have summered outdoors.&nbsp; The more temperature-sensitive 
plants should be brought in to stay.&nbsp; This would include Gesneriads, 
Dracaena, Schefflera, Ficus, and Aralia species.&nbsp;Others can be kept 
outdoors during the day and brought in when temperatures are expected to drop 
below 45-50 degrees.<br>
<br>
 There is an appreciable difference between the 
quantity and quality of light your plants have been receiving all summer 
outdoors, and that which they will receive indoors in the fall and winter. Just 
as we recommended acclimating your plants to outdoor direct sun over a two-week 
period in the spring, it is important to re-acclimate them to indoor conditions 
in the fall. Gradually toning down the amount of light a plant is exposed to 
will result in minimal loss of foliage during adjustment.&nbsp;Put plants in 
heavy shade outdoors for one week, then in your sunniest window indoors for at 
least two weeks, and gradually move them into their permanent locations.<br>

<br> Just before they are ready to make the move from outdoors to indoors, give 
each plant a thorough inspection and a clean bill of health. Check the foliage 
carefully for pests. Pay special attention to the undersides of the leaves, new 
growth, and junctions of leaf and stem (these areas can harbor mites, aphids, 
and mealy bugs, respectively).<br>
<br>
 Even is you seen no sign of insects, 
the next step should be a thorough washing with soapy water (mild dishwashing 
liquid is fine), followed by a rinsing with clear water from the garden 
hose.&nbsp; If there is a definite insect problem and insecticide may be used 
after washing.<br>
<br>
 This is also a good time to rid the soil of excess 
mineral salts which have accumulated from fertilizing. To do this, run clear 
water through the pot, using approximately ten times as much water as it 
normally requires to wet the soil ball.&nbsp; This will dissolve any mineral 
salts in the soil and flush them away.<br>
<br>
 After you have brought your 
plants indoors do not expect them to carry on as it nothing has 
happened.&nbsp;You should be prepared for some loss of foliage has 
happened.&nbsp; You should be prepared for some loss of foliage during the 
first few weeks.&nbsp;Your plants&rsquo; metabolism will probably slow down or 
even come to a complete stand-still(!); they may use up water slowly or not at 
all.&nbsp; Let each plant take its time to adjust, and do not water it unless 
sufficient dryness of the soil indicates that it is necessary.<br>
<br>
 After 
the plant adjusts, the lower light intensity, reduced air movement, and cooler 
temperatures will continue to influence its metabolism, and in general you 
should not expect it to require watering as often as before.<br>
<br>
 Just 
remember to give your plants sufficient light, individual attention with regard 
to watering (no once-per-week watering schedule, please!), and occasional 
washing to discourage insects and dust, and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with 
healthy greenery to enjoy the year-round!</p> 
<p><strong>Fall</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Autumn, a season of 
changes.&nbsp; The days are becoming shorter.&nbsp;There is a &ldquo;nip&rdquo; 
in the air, telling us of colder weather in the offing.&nbsp; The oaks, maples, 
and other deciduous trees provide a show of fall colors as they prepare for 
winter dormancy.<br>
<br>
 How do our indoor plants react to these 
changes?&nbsp; The metabolism, or growth processes of plants is regulated by 
the environment.&nbsp;In the summer the warmth, long daylight hours, high light 
intensity, and plenty of air circulation influence the metabolism in a positive 
way.&nbsp; The faster metabolism is evident to us in an abundance of rapid 
growth and corresponding frequent demand for watering and fertilizing.<br>
<br>

 Autumn brings cooler temperatures, shorter days, lower light intensity, and 
limited circulation of air, resulting in a slower plant metabolism.&nbsp; Since 
house plants are not growing a rapidly as before, they will use their water at 
a markedly slower rate.&nbsp; Many plants will stay wet for weeks.&nbsp; (The 
drying effect of forced-air heat in some homes may cause the soil to dry 
quickly, however.)<br>
<br>
 This is the time when careless watering habits 
should be corrected; overwatering can not be tolerated.&nbsp;There are a number 
of pre-cautionary steps we can take to keep our houseplants healthy.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Many plants will probably suggest this fall and winter at the hands of the 
once-a-week waterer.&nbsp; When you keep your plants wet too long, you have 
filled in all of the air spaces with water and drown the roots.&nbsp;Eventually 
the plant fails.&nbsp;The best way to prevent this from happening to your 
plants is to check each plant individually for watering; let the feel or 
appearance of the soil tell you that it is the time to water the plant.</li> 
<li>Most plants (excluding water-lovers like ferns and plants in very small 
pots) would like to become drier that usual between waterings.&nbsp; As a 
general rule, the following genera of houseplants should dry halfway to 
three-quarters of the way through their pots during the fall and winter: 
Dracaenas, Aglaonemas (Chinese Evergreen), Cissus (especially grape ivy), and 
Philodrendron species, and Cacti and other Succulents.&nbsp; This rule should 
be modified according to how much light the plants is in, size of container, 
and other variables.&nbsp;Although many plants need to dry out between 
waterings in the fall and winter, no plant should become bone dry through the 
entire pot and then stay done dry (not even Cacti!).</li> 
<li>At this time of year in particular, a moisture meter can be a very wise 
investment for the health and longevity of your plants.&nbsp; A reliable 
moisture meter is calibrated to show the percentage of moisture in the 
soil.&nbsp; This enables you to determine accurately whether a plant is dry 
enough to require watering, or whether you should wait and check again in a few 
days.&nbsp; It is especially handy for use on large plants and plants which 
need to dry out between waterings.</li> 
<li>An ounce of prevention &hellip; Fungus attacks plants which have been made 
susceptible by overwatering, insufficient light, or because of poor air 
circulation, as is the case in most homes during the colder portions of the 
year.&nbsp; A good preventive is the use of a systemic fungicide (check the 
label), some can be mixed with the plants&rsquo; water and used with each 
watering.</li> 
<li>Fertilizing once every three or four weeks will be sufficient for most 
house plants at this time of year.</li> 
<li>Even is you are careful in your watering, a fuzzy mold may appear on top 
of the soil on some plants.&nbsp; This is due in part to limited air 
circulation. It is a normal occurrence and the mold can just be scraped off.
</li> 
<li>Oftentimes in the fall and winter the amount of light that some of your 
plants receive will be insufficient for survival, even though lighting was 
adequate in the summer months.&nbsp; This may prove to be the case with plants 
that are in decorative locations away from windows.&nbsp; That split-leaf 
Philodendron may have done quite well in your not-so-well-lit corner this 
summer, but it could develop problems as the amount of light, intensity of 
light, and number of sunny days decrease in fall.&nbsp; The answer is to 
problems of limited natural light is artificial lighting.&nbsp;Artificial 
lighting provides a consistent, dependable source of quality light.&nbsp; 
Flowering plants such as African Violets and other Gesneriads will bloom 
happily throughout the year with artificial lighting, and you have the 
advantage of being able to select a spot for your plants without worrying about 
the availability of natural light from windows.&nbsp;There are florescent 
fixtures and incandescent grow-light spot fixtures available (normal house 
lamps will not work!).&nbsp; Additionally, the plant must be directly under the 
light fixture (not even a foot or two to the side) and the light must be on for 
8-12 hours every day.&nbsp; With artificial lighting and a little bit of 
imagination, that basement or dark living room corner can become an 
interesting, attractive, and very much a &ldquo;live&rdquo; part of the house.
</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Winter</strong><strong></strong><br>
 Plants need special care in 
the winter months!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s some helpful Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts!
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do try to move plants to the windows so they get more light </li> 
<li>Do use artificial lights (specially designed for plants) to help them 
through dark dreary days.</li> 
<li>Do still fertilize your plants, but only every 4-6 weeks. </li> 
<li>Do wash your plants to keep free of dust. (Any mild dish soap with a warm 
water rinse.)</li> 
<li>Do use a plant fungicide in your water to ward off disease. </li> 
<li>Do water your plants only when they need it. </li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t have your plants near doors where cold drafts can damage 
tender leaves. Don&rsquo;t let any leaves of your plants touch the window panes 
during the cold months.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use cold water on plants, the roots like at least room 
temperature water.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t have plants in clay pots right next to windows, the pot will 
conduct cold to the soil, chilling the plant roots.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Botanical Biographies Hedera Helix - English Ivies</strong><strong>
</strong><br>
 Many of our customers have stated that they &ldquo;have no 
luck&rdquo; with ivies. There can be many reasons for a plant failure &ndash; 
incorrect lighting, incorrect watering, poor soil or uncontrolled insects. 
Unfortunately, the &ldquo;luck of the Irish&rdquo; won&rsquo;t make a 
difference if a plant&rsquo;s environment isn&rsquo;t right.<br>
<br>
 The 
English ivies can offer us &ldquo;energy efficient&rdquo; plants for any home. 
They are evergreen woody vines of the Aralia family that grow as ground cover 
throughout the temperate and subtropical zones. The temperate range of 
winter-hardy varieties is 45-75&deg; and the subtropical 60-80&deg;. Most will 
do well in any window exposure, with glacier or Chicago (white and green 
variegated leaves) preferring at least some partial sun.</p> 
<p>Because of their fine root system and dense thin leaves they cannot store 
much water and will not tolerate being allowed to dry out. With a porous 
potting mix, allowing just the surface to dry is sufficient.</p> 
<p>All ivies respond to &ldquo;haircuts&rdquo; and easily root from cuttings. 
Any insect attack can be easily controlled by washing the plant regularly 
&ndash; (once to twice a month) and careful inspection of the plant.</p> 
<p><strong>The Indispensable Aroid Family</strong><br>
 This family has given 
us more good &ldquo;long life and low light&rdquo; plants than any other plant 
family.<br>
<br>
 One of the most interesting features of this group are the 
flowers. They are unusual in appearance having a center the spadix surrounded 
by a leaf-like bract or funnel shaped spathe.&nbsp; Many varieties will produce 
a berry or pods which will turn bright red (ex: Chinese Evergreen).<br>
<br>
 
Family members include: Aglaonema &ldquo;Chinese Evergreen&rdquo;, 
Philodendron, Pothos &ldquo;Devils Ivy&rdquo;, Nephthytis &ldquo;arrowhead 
vine&rdquo;, Spathiphyllum &ldquo;Peace Lily&rdquo;, and Dieffenbachia 
&ldquo;Dumbcane&rdquo;.&nbsp; For a plant requiring little care, most times 
little light, and offering beauty and variety one would be wise to choose an 
Ariod Family member.</p> 
<p><strong>Spathiphyllum - The Peace Lily</strong><strong></strong><br>
 The 
&ldquo;peace lilies&rdquo; are easy growing tropical American herbs, with lush 
green foliage, and a succession of &ldquo;Flowers&rdquo; (resembling 
Anthuriums) that have showy with spaths.&nbsp; They will grow nicely in almost 
any lighting level and make a perfect addition to anyone&rsquo;s plant 
collection.</p> 
<p><strong>Areca Palms (Chrysalidocarpus Lutescens)</strong><br>
 A member of 
the Palm family, the Areca is a durable indoor plant, originally from 
Madagascar. It enjoys warmth but will live in temperatures down to 50&deg; F. 
The Areca Palm has creamy stems with dark brown flecking and very graceful 
fronds. It enjoys sunlight but will also grow in a north window which has 
bright light thoughout the day.&nbsp; With proper care and maintenance the 
Areca Palm will add elegance to your home year-round.</p> 
<p><strong>Cacti Misunderstood Beauties</strong><br>
 With over 2000 recorded 
species, the cactus family is native to the Americas from Canada to 
Chili.&nbsp;They have adapted themselves to semi-arid or near-desert regios and 
provide us with excellent plants for our dry homes.&nbsp; One characteristic 
distinct to all cacti and no other plant is the spine cushion or areole.&nbsp; 
Most species have spines from areoles although some varieties are 
spineless.&nbsp; The areoles are like internodes (where a leaf joins the stem 
on other plants) and are growing points for branches, flowers or spines.&nbsp; 
The spines, always thought to be an armor against predators, now are known to 
be a shading and water-collecting device for the plant.<br>
<br>
 Cactus can 
offer some of the most beautiful flowers found in nature.&nbsp; Flowers appear 
late spring or summer only after a cool (45-65&deg;) dry (water when dry 3/4 of 
the way down the pot) winter peiod.<br>
<br>
 Cacti will be best in a soilless 
mix and prefer full or partial sun windows.&nbsp; They will offer great variety 
in shape, size, flowers and are one of the easiest plants to grow!</p> 
<p><strong>Ficus - the Fig Tree for Indoors</strong><strong></strong><br>
 For 
ornamental use, Ficus offers is an array of lush foliage plants, many frowing 
to nice sized indoor trees.&nbsp; They are not temperamental and provide needed 
greenery for home.&nbsp; Ficus varieties will enjoy any window exposure, 
preferring a sunny location, and care nothing about humidity.&nbsp; They 
provide almost indestructible if provided ample lighting and enjoy a light, 
soilless mix.<br>
<br>
 Ficus come in all shapes and sizes, best known probably 
the Rubber Plant (Ficus Decora) and the weeping Fig (Ficus Benjamina).&nbsp; 
Some oddities among the Ficus are Fiddleleaf Fig (Ficus Lyrata), the Varigated 
Rubber Tree (Ficus Doescheri) and Creeping fig (Ficus Pumila), a small leaf 
vine not resembling any other Ficus variety.<br>
<br>
 Try one or try them all, 
the many Ficus varieties will truly give you a taste of the tropics for your 
home.</p> <br>
