<h1>Creative Containers</h1> <b>Create excitement for clients and customers 
with brilliant, easy-to-assemble and easy-to-sell container gardens.</b><br>

<em>By Patti Nagai, Ph.D.</em><br>
<br>
 Multiple hanging baskets combine with 
standing containers to provide shade, privacy and brilliant color at an outdoor 
caf&eacute;. 
<p>Containers are a fabulous way to add color, texture, fragrance and even 
tasty goodness to your client's home, whether they're intended for a balcony, 
patio or in a traditional suburban yard. A handy formula for creating container 
gardens has made the circuit for years now - the 
&quot;Thriller-Filler-Spiller&quot; design with a tall plant in the center, 
something full and colorful in between and a vine hanging over the edge. But 
don't worry about following the rules. Anything goes with containers these 
days, so try something new this year. Keep in mind, though, the basics for a 
healthy container garden: Good soil, good drainage, good site selection - and 
the right plants - will make and keep container plantings beautiful and healthy 
throughout the season.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Begin with good design</h3> 
<p>Garden design is important because a container is a garden, albeit a small 
one, and it needs to blend and integrate into the surrounding area. Placement 
of containers could be on a porch, in a woodland area, in a vegetable garden or 
in a flowerbed. The container itself could be a focal point, or multiple 
containers could be used as a flowing connection between two garden areas, 
living spaces or as a guide to a business entrance.</p> 
<p>Color themes are always popular, whether it is the tried and true red, 
white and blue or the cool, peaceful colors of silver, white and purple. Color 
combinations can set the mood for a garden container and invite people in to a 
peaceful, relaxing setting or grab their attention with eye-popping bold 
colors. Hot colors such as orange and red warm people up and stimulate their 
appetite. Cool colors such as blue, gray and green will keep them calm and 
relaxed. Container gardens are an easy way to introduce these colors into a 
living, working or even therapeutic area.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
Large, dramatic containers planted with cool colors provide an 
elegant transition from concrete surface to the garden beyond.<br>

<h3>Container basics</h3> 
<p>Choose the container based on where it will be situated. Consider the space 
available, how tall the plants will be (will a trellis or other support be 
needed?), whether a single container or multiple containers will be used, and 
most importantly: How much light will the container receive during the day? 
Full sun is needed for growing herbs, vegetables and many of the flowering 
plants. Full sun is defined as greater than six hours of direct sunlight a day, 
which is sometimes difficult to obtain with planters under overhangs and near 
buildings.</p> <br>
A cluster of similar containers creates a small, 
easy-to-maintain garden tableau. 
<p>Consider the planter as a piece of art, or simply as a functional holder 
for the plants, which will then become the work of art. Use whimsical planters 
for children's areas. Match styles and colors to the d&eacute;cor of the home 
or building. Recycled containers are wonderful to use, but should be food-safe 
if you are growing herbs and vegetables. Metal containers are sometimes an 
issue due to potential lead, copper or zinc contamination. Lead is a problem 
for humans, but copper and zinc can create toxicity issues for the plants. 
Consider using a liner for metal containers.</p> 
<p>Large containers that will be left outdoors all year round should be freeze 
resistant if your winters come with ice and snow. Many ceramic and concrete 
containers must be protected over the winter to keep from cracking.</p> <br>

<p>Plants will grow in most anything as long as there is enough soil or 
soilless mix, and there is a drainage hole. Good drainage is the key to 
successful container gardening. Resist the temptation to use a container 
without drainage holes. Use &quot;feet&quot; or a plant tray turned upside down 
to keep the container up off the surface whether it's soil, concrete, brick or 
decking material. Feet can be functional and fun, and should be promoted for 
use with container gardens. Pots can literally look like they have feet or 
claws, or the feet can simply be plastic pads or plastic triangular supports. 
With slight elevation, the pot will drain better, and there will be fewer 
problems with deck and patio staining.</p>

Above, combining ornamentals with edibles saves space in a 
small residential setting. Below, use &quot;feet&quot; to keep the container up 
off the surface, whether it's soil, concrete, brick or decking material.<br>

<br> <br>

<h3>What type of container? </h3> 
<p>The variety of container styles can be overwhelming, but what's also 
important is the container's composition.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Clay pots require a high frequency of watering, so they're great for 
plants that like dry conditions. Clay is very porous, and salts - and sometimes 
algae - may build up on the exterior and rim of the pot. These containers also 
are heavy and breakable.</li> 
<li>Plastic containers are easy to use and easy to keep clean, and they retain 
moisture better than clay pots. New styles look like terra cotta or glazed 
ceramic; and although an advantage is that they're lightweight, this means they 
can turn over easily. Plastic is generally not breakable, however.</li> 
<li>Ceramic, glazed pottery retains moisture longer than unglazed pots, so 
make sure there is a drainage hole. Some foreign imports may be contaminated 
with lead, either in the clay or in the glaze.</li> 
<li>Metal is not recommended as a primary container for growing plants, as the 
metals can leach into the soil and cause toxicity problems. It's advisable to 
use a liner or secondary pot within the metal container. Depending on the 
metal, rust may develop from frequent watering. For a &quot;rustic&quot; look, 
however, this can be a bonus.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Proper soil is critical</h3> 
<p> Container gardens grow fast and furiously when provided with the right 
soil environment. Go organic! Use a lot of organic matter in your soil or 
soilless mix to increase growth and help retain moisture in the pot. Happy 
roots produce happy plants, beautiful blooms and more fruit! Remember the 
container is a limited growth environment for plants; the soil mix will make 
the difference in their health.</p> 
<p>Soilless potting mixes are generally organic, usually containing peat moss, 
compost and sometimes pine bark. In addition, they may have perlite or 
vermiculite added for drainage. Soil - real soil - adds a lot of weight to the 
mix, but it can certainly be included for outdoor container gardening. Adding 
soil to a soilless mix is great for large containers; just make sure it is 
clean, sterilized soil to reduce the risk of disease or insects. That 
additional weight in the pot may be very helpful as the summer progresses and 
your plants get taller and more top heavy. Extra weight also keeps containers 
from taking a walk late at night.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Consider choosing edibles</h3> 
<p>For a different twist on container gardening, surprise your customers with 
colorful, edible plants. Food production in pots can be as simple as a single 
tomato plant in a five-gallon bucket, but adding a touch of creativity to a 
single tomato plant could turn it into a &quot;salsa garden of delight.&quot; 
Try combining 'Margherita' tomato, 'Chichimeca' jalapeno pepper and a few 
plants of cilantro - perhaps the All-America Selection 'Delfino' - to spice up 
the container's look as well as the taste.</p> 
<p>Maybe a colorful salad container would be appreciated. Try 'Garden Babies' 
butterhead lettuce, 'Sweetie Baby Romaine', 'Sea of Red' lettuce, 'Thumbelina' 
carrot, and 'Salad Bush' cucumber for a one-pot salad that's ready to harvest. 
Some vegetables are beautiful and healthy: An all-eggplant container that would 
also be a conversation starter could contain the All-America Selection winners 
'Hansel', 'Gretel' and 'Fairy Tale'.</p> 
<p>Mix flowers in with vegetables, mix herbs with flowers, mix tropicals with 
foliage plants. The potential for container combinations is endless, as long as 
you mix and match plants based on size and location of your container, and the 
light and water needs of the plants.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Care of the container garden</h3> 
<p>Water is absolutely essential, and outdoor containers will require frequent 
watering as the summer progresses and the plants get bigger. Advise your 
clients to check containers daily to see if they are dry, and be sure to water 
thoroughly till water drains through the bottom of the pot. Do not let plants 
sit in water; water is needed, but good drainage is also essential!</p> 
<p>For best results over the summer, incorporate into the soil mix a 
timed-release fertilizer for flowering plants - do this before planting. In 
addition, fertilize every two weeks with a balanced nutrient mix (for example, 
10-10-10 or 20-20-20) or a fertilizer for flowering plants (such as 9-18-9 or 
5-10-10). This may seem like a lot of work, and you may need to remind your 
customers that these plants are in a confined, limited resource pot and will 
grow quickly. In addition, with the regular and frequent watering that outdoor 
container gardens require, many nutrients will be leached out of the soil.</p> 
<p>Gardening can be tricky for those new to this most popular hobby, but 
gardening in containers is an easy way to get them started. Once successful, 
they'll keep coming back for more - more containers, more plants, more 
fertilizer and more education.</p> 
<h3>Thinking outside the pot</h3> <br>
A simple but effective combination of 
cool blooms and bold foliage makes a welcoming statement. 
<p>  Creativity comes out in individual container designs and groupings of 
containers when the limits are pushed. Overflowing containers can be dramatic, 
but may require a bit more care, a little more fertilizer and extra water. </p> 
<ul> 
<li>  Too many plants? Simply remove one or more as the season progresses. 
</li> 
<li>  Too few plants? Fill in with a bolder color or dramatic foliage. Be sure 
the plants that are added require the same care. </li> 
<li>  Just right? That's the container that fills in, grows up and flows over 
using every square inch of space available. </li> </ul> 
<p>  Creativity also arises when containers are used as a true garden space. 
The basics of garden planning and design still apply: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>  Site selection and view </li> 
<li>  Available light </li> 
<li>  Soil type and drainage </li> 
<li>  Focal point </li> 
<li>  Color - cool, warm or hot </li> 
<li>  Texture </li> 
<li>  Fragrance </li> 
<li>  Size of the plants - height and spread </li> </ul> 
<p>Containers are the perfect way to try new plants, new techniques and even 
new foods, without as much investment as that spent on a large flower or 
vegetable garden. Encourage the trend. Encourage clients to grow more, and 
encourage them to chronicle their adventures in container gardening through 
photographs and container &quot;recipes.&quot; Sharing these successes can 
boost their confidence - and your bottom line.</p>
