<strong> Waste Calendars 2010-11&nbsp;</strong> <br>
<br>
 Council produces a 
financial yearly waste calendar so you know what bin to place out for 
collection week to week <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1>Waste Calendar 2010 -11</h1> 
<p>Council provides the yearly bin calendar for North and South suburbs across 
the Local Government Area (LGA).</p> 
<p>Waste Calendar North 2010-11</p> 
<p>Waste Calendar South 2010-11</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>Your Garbage Service</h1> 
<p><strong>Items That Belong in Your Red Lid Garbage Bin</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>waste material that cannot be recycled or composted </li> 
<li>plastic bags </li> 
<li>crockery </li> 
<li>pizza boxes, serviettes, paper plates </li> 
<li>light globes and window glass </li> 
<li>non-recyclable plastics and styrofoam containers.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Items That Do Not Belong in Your Red Lid Barbage Bin</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>building or demolition materials including bricks, floor or roof tiles, 
carpet or concrete</li> 
<li>hazardous waste including pool cleaners, chlorine, chemicals or pesticides 
</li> 
<li>solvents, brake fluid, oils and other liquid wastes </li> 
<li>automotive parts and other scrap metal </li> 
<li>soil and rocks </li> 
<li>hot ash </li> 
<li>syringes.</li> </ul> 
<h1>Change Your Bin Size </h1> 
<p>Did you know you can save money and help the environment by scaling down 
the size of your household waste bin?</p> 
<p>Choose between three sizes</p> 
<ul> 
<li>80 litre </li> 
<li>120 litre </li> 
<li>240 litre.</li> </ul> 
<p>By choosing the smallest (80 litre) bin size, you can save money on your 
waste levy each year and make a difference to our precious environment. Opting 
for an 80 litre bin instead of the largest size (240 litres) will mean a waste 
levy saving of $300 per year.</p> 
<p>Using&nbsp;your green waste and recycling bins correctly also frees up 
space in&nbsp;your red lid garbage bin. Figures show food and other compostable 
material makes up around 50% of waste collected. Taking some simple steps, like 
setting up a compost or worm farm, can put this material to good use and keep 
it out of the waste system.</p> 
<p>If you want to change the size of your garbage bin, complete a Application 
for Change of Garbage Bin Size notification form and return the form with 
payment of $60. Please contact Council's Customer Service Centre on (02) 4227 
7111&nbsp; and complete the&nbsp;form found below.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>Your&nbsp;Green Waste Service</h1> 
<p><strong>The Following Items Belong in Your Green Lid Waste Bin</strong></p> 
<ul>

<li>flowers </li> 
<li>garden prunings </li>

<li>timber off cuts (must be untreated, unpainted with no nails) less than 
50cm in length and 7.5cm in diameter.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Do not</strong> tie, jam or place items in plastic bags. Please 
ensure your green waste bin is not too heavy for collection vehicles to lift. 
If bins are too heavy they will not be emptied. It's best to ensure the 
contents are dry before placing them loosely into the bin.<br>
