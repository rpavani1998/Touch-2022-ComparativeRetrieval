<p><strong>Setting Up Your Container Garden: Tips for Apartment Dwellers and 
Small Spaces</strong></p> 
<p>&ndash; Amy</p> 
<p>Many moons ago, I tried to convince a boyfriend to let me grow food in his 
yard, tearing out existing landscape. (He declined and now has a vegetable bed 
in the worst place, which I secretly love.) I have a habit of sizing up random 
yards searching for the perfect place to grow food because sadly, I don&rsquo;t 
have a yard or garden of my own. I&rsquo;m relegated to planting any food I 
want in pots. It's honestly not my preference, but still, I like to think that 
I&rsquo;ve perfected the art of growing in my microclimate. I know I share 
circumstances with many of you: without some pots on a patio, balcony, or 
windowsill, we would be plant-less. No fun. So, for this installment of City 
Dirt, we&rsquo;re covering container basics for the urbanite looking to supply 
their kitchen with some garden goodness.</p> 
<p>You should know from the onset that not all vegetables grow well in 
containers. By planting in a contained environment, you are inhibiting the 
plant&rsquo;s growth to some extent. Think about it &mdash; plants can send out 
roots and root hairs only as far as the walls of the pot allow. Restricted by 
the pot, not all plants will come to full maturity and produce food. This 
presents the biggest challenge of growing food in small spaces.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Deciding What to Grow</strong><br>
 The ultimate goal is for your 
garden to be productive. I aim for a constant supply of ingredients for the 
kitchen, so I nurture plants that can be continually harvested. I suggest 
growing plants that will be used frequently, but in small amounts. This gives 
plants time to regrow between cuttings &mdash; no sense in planting a crop that 
you&rsquo;ll wipe out in one go. (I figure it&rsquo;s better to have something 
available over a long course of time.)</p> 
<p>&bull; <strong>I rely heavily on herbs in my garden.</strong> Herbs will 
single-handedly change the flavor of most recipes and are often pricey at the 
grocery; many are not commercially available.</p> 
<p>&bull; <strong>Plants that produce abundant quantities of ingredients
</strong> that I know I&rsquo;ll use often are also a favorite. Lettuces, for 
example: these are wonderful to grow at home. They take up little space, 
produce (and reproduce!) quickly, and offer fresh greens for salads, or for a 
nice leafy garnish. I use lettuce in large amounts, and their fast growing 
cycle makes them highly productive, economical, and worthwhile.</p> 
<p>&bull; <strong>Plan on mixing it up</strong> to make sure there is always 
something new and different to harvest. Choose plants that will run through 
their life cycle in one season (annuals) as well as plants that continue to 
come back year after year in the same pot (perennials).</p> 
<p>&bull; <strong>Make the most of what you grow</strong> by considering its 
uses beyond the kitchen. Lavender makes a subtle herb rub for seared duck 
breast and can also be used as a herbal stuffing for an eye pillow. Scented 
geranium leaves can be chopped and used in sweet recipes, infused into water 
for a facial toner, or steeped to make teas.</p> 
<p>&bull; <strong>A container garden should ebb and flow, just like a large 
garden.</strong> Some plants are grown for their leaves, some for their seeds, 
and some for their fruits. I try to round out my garden plan so there is always 
something ready to harvest. Today, as I write this, I have marjoram, thyme, and 
scented geraniums that survived the winter. Arugula and mache are just popping 
up, too, having reseeded themselves from last year (at the end of the season I 
stopped harvesting their leaves and let them &quot;go to seed&quot; &mdash; the 
matured plant grows seed pods that fall into the soil and regrow). Within three 
weeks, the lovage should be starting to show (the same plants I&rsquo;ve had 
for four years) and I&rsquo;ll be planting a second crop of arugula.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
 To start a garden in containers, at a 
bare minimum you&rsquo;ll need pots, soil, and a low-level organic fertilizer. 
A bag of compost is also a great addition. Access to water is an important 
consideration. In my own garden, I fill eight old water bottles and carry them 
back and forth from my kitchen sink. Just make sure you have some way to water 
your plants, as containers require a diligent watering schedule.</p> 
<p>Most plants need a little legroom to stretch their roots. Try to plant in a 
pot that&rsquo;s a bit bigger than the plant will actually need. It is better 
to leave a little wiggle room than to have plant roots mashing up against the 
container walls. If you allow for some growth, you increase the odds of your 
plant growing to full maturity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Materials</strong><br>
 Plastic pots are the least expensive 
container option, so they&rsquo;re great for anyone on a budget. It&rsquo;s 
true that they are usually the least attractive option, but they hold their 
moisture longer than clay or ceramic pots and are lighter and easier to move 
around.</p> 
<p>Clay pots are porous, so air moves easily through their walls. This is 
helpful in that it allows roots to breathe and keeps them out of direct water, 
but it&rsquo;s not helpful in that the soil tends to dry out quickly. In hot 
weather you&rsquo;ll need to closely monitor the moisture in your clay pots. 
They are a fairly inexpensive option for the home gardener after plastic, and 
they come in myriad shapes and sizes. If you choose clay pots, be sure to 
purchase a saucer or plate to sit under the pot. This works in two ways &mdash; 
to keep moisture off the surface of your deck or patio and to hold in moisture 
for the plant.</p> 
<p>I won't be discussing it here, but making your own pots is super rewarding, 
too!</p> 
<p><strong>Soil</strong><br>
 You must use potting soil in your containers 
&mdash; soil mixes are formulated to maintain a certain level of lightness so 
that plants are able to breathe, drain well, and still hold in some moisture. 
(Air is right up there with sun and water in importance to healthy, thriving 
plants!) Look for organic potting soil mixes from smaller regional companies 
rather than the national brands you&rsquo;ll find in big-box stores. Choose a 
potting soil that has no added fertilizer or nutrients. It is best to add those 
on your own as needed for the particular plants you will grow.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you are adding new plants to previously used containers, do not rely on 
simply digging a small hole in the soil and stuffing in a plant start. Old 
soils often contain dead roots from previous plants (see above). These roots 
will impede the new plant&rsquo;s roots and constrict air as the new plant 
tries to grow into the same small space. For that reason, just as you would in 
a garden bed, it&rsquo;s best to rework your soil before planting. As on the 
farm, till your soil using a fork or your hands. Loosen it up, remove the root 
hairs, then gently work in some compost and a spoonful of a low-level organic 
fertilizer before adding a new plant start.</p> 
<p>We will cover more container plant topics like feeding your plant, tending 
for plants, and more in upcoming articles, but for now these are the basics you 
need to get growing. As ever, I&rsquo;m looking forward to all of your 
questions in the comments!</p>

<p>I am a cook and food writer, author &amp; gardener who is passionate about 
the environment, using sustainable resources, reducing my impact on the earth 
and making conscious food choices that are both smart for the planet and taste 
fantastic. When I'm not knee deep in dirt growing food, you can find me in the 
kitchen where I'm likely standing over a canning pot or staring up in to my 
pantry deciding what to make. In the gardens, I have a business gogo green 
garden, wherein I build, plant &amp; tend edible gardens for folks in their 
urban backyards. I also launched a garden-sharing website in 2009 that connects 
urban gardeners to unused garden space across the country -

<p>Thanks for the great post! I've just started getting into gardening myself. 
My mom always had a small herb and vegetable garden, and now for the first time 
I have my own little garden, on my windowsill inside my kitchen. My rosemary, 
thyme, and sage that just survived their first winter and are having a little 
growth spurt thanks to the sun that decided to show its face a little more. (My 
basil only made it to November, but I'm excited to get it going again). Anyway, 
your post was great and has definitely inspired me to explore more options when 
I move this summer to as place that *hopefully* has a teeeny bit more space to 
expand to more pots and more than just herbs [I'd definitely like to try 
lettuce!). I was hoping maybe you could point us in the direction for good 
resources that will specifically describe which plants will or will not do well 
and plants and what kind of sunlight and season different plants need. Also, I 
think it'd be really cool if you knew of DIY ways to fortify your plants. For 
example, I think my grandfather used to use egg shells in his garden (but I 
don't know why), or anything like that. [I don't currently have the capacity 
for true composting]. Thanks so much and I'm excited for it to get warmer to 
start planting!</p>

<p>I've got some beets started in my basement right now under grow lights. <br>
Once they've produced their first true leaves, can I put them in pots on my 
porch?<br>
Or should beets only be grown in a garden bed? <br>

<p>And for those of us who have no balcony, nor are able to set plants outside 
on windowsills, but must make do with strictly indoor container gardening, what 
do you recommend? Aside from moving?</p>

<p>Can you say a little more about which plants do and do not do well in 
containers? Last summer, I tried my hand at container gardening for the first 
time and grew herbs, hot peppers, bell peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes. The 
herbs, hot peppers, and eggplant did great. The bell peppers did ok (although 
the fruit stayed fairly small) and the tomatoes did rather poorly. (Of course, 
all of the failures may be due as much to my poor gardening technique as 
anything else). Which fruiting plants do you recommend for containers, and 
which are destined for failure?</p>

<p>Great post! I had a balcony garden last year with promise, but I 
unfortunately neglected it over time (plus partial sun wasn't treating some of 
the plants well). The one question I always have is, how large should my pots 
be? I imagine it varies depending on the type of plant. Can you recommend a 
minimum size, or even sizes according to type of plant? Thanks!</p>
