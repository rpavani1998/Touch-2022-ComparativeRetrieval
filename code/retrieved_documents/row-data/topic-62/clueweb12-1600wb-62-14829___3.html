 The Inside Scoop on Houseplants
<br>  &nbsp;  The key to houseplant success is putting the right plant in the 
right place. When we bring plants home, it's important to remember that we 
bring their preferences with them. We need to know what conditions they needed 
in their natural habitat such as light, water, temperature and humidity and try 
to meet those requirements.
<p>Light Requirements<br>
 Light is the most critical factor in growing 
interior plants successfully. What light intensity do you have?</p> 
<p>Light can be described as follows: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Full sun &#150; 5 hours of sun, southern window</li> 
<li>Some sun &#150; less that 5 hours of sun, within 2 ft of a southern 
window, in an east/west window</li> 
<li>Bright light &#150; within 5 ft of any window that gets some sun.</li> 
<li>Medium light - 5-8 ft from a sunny window or directly in a northern window
</li> 
<li>Low light &#150; receiving indirect light only such as a corner or hall
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>A few tips about light<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Light duration is the total amount of light a plant gets in a 24-hour 
period. Sometimes a plant can grow in less intense light than recommended if it 
receives lower light for a longer time.</li> 
<li>Light quality is the source of light energy, whether sun or artificial. If 
there isn't enough natural light you can supplement with artificial light.</li> 
<li>Flowering plants generally require more light that non-flowering. Foliage 
plants with variegated leaves need more light than plants with solid green 
leaves.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Water Requirements<br>
 When do you water and how much? This is extremely 
important. Over-watering is the number one cause of interior plant death.</p> 
<p>Water Frequency<br>
 Do not water on a schedule. Water only as needed. 
There are many factors that determine when to water.<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Plant Variety &#150; know your plant and its requirements. A cactus 
needs much less frequent watering than a primrose.</li> 
<li>The Container &#150; the soil in clay pots dries out much more quickly 
that that in plastic or glazed ceramic.</li> 
<li>The Potting Soil &#150; Every soil holds water differently. Soils with 
organic material hold water better than those with more drainage material.</li> 
<li>The Light &#150; a plant in bright light will need more frequent watering 
than the same plant in lower light.</li> 
<li>The Stage of Growth &#150; actively growing plants need more frequent 
watering than dormant plants.</li> 
<li>The Size of the Plant &#150; a 4-inch plant requires more frequent 
watering than the same 10-inch plant, which holds moisture longer.</li> 
<li>Hanging Plants &#150; as a rule they need more frequent watering because 
it is warmer closer to the ceiling.</li> 
<li>Temperature &#150; when the temperature is warmer, plants need more 
frequent watering.</li> 
<li>Humidity &#150; the less humid the home, the more frequent you need to 
water.</li> 
<li>Thick Leaved Plants &#150; as a rule they require less frequent watering 
because of their ability to store water.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Water Amount<br>
 Basically when watering, water thoroughly allowing water 
to go completely through the plant so that the complete root system is watered, 
and also so that salts that collect in the soils are washed out.<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not allow plants to sit in water. Empty excess from saucer.</li> 
<li>Moist-not-wet, as a general rule.</li> 
<li>Do not allow soil to become &quot;bone&quot; dry.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>In reading about your particular plant requirements you will run into 
several terms. Here are their definitions.<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep evenly moist: soil should be wet throughout but not soggy. Water when 
the surface feels dry.</li> 
<li>Water when dry: when you put our finger 1 inch down in the soil and it's 
dry, it's time to water.</li> 
<li>Allow to dry: water when the soil is dry between 1-2 inches deep. Allow to 
dry completely; as in cacti and succulents.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Temperature Requirements<br>
 Most plant prefer 65-75&deg; F. during the 
day and 10&deg; less at night. Extended time below 50&deg; F. can damage 
foliage plants and cause leaf drop or discoloration. All plants have a 
temperature range where they grow best. It would be good to know what your 
plant prefers.</p> 
<p>Humidity Requirements<br>
 Most plants prefer humidity over 30%. Homes and 
offices in the winter usually have less than that. You can do several things to 
meet those humidity requirements.<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a humidifier.</li> 
<li>Place plants on pebbles in a tray of water (the plant pot bottom should 
not sit in the water).</li> 
<li>Group plants together.</li> 
<li>Mist with a mister bottle (especially ferns).</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>We have covered the four major requirements (light, water, temperature, 
humidity) for plants but also key to interior plant success are fertilizing, 
soil, repotting and grooming.</p> 
<p>Fertilizer<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>As a general rule: when in doubt, don't fertilize.</li> 
<li>It is not a medicine for sick plants. Fertilizer does not magically 
correct a water or light problem. (Darn!)</li> 
<li>Wait 6 months before fertilizing a newly purchased plant. Most growers use 
slow release fertilizers. If you fertilize on top of that, you could burn roots.
</li> 
<li>Follow directions on the package and do not make the mixture stronger than 
manufacturers recommendations. Too frequent or too strong can damage or kill 
your plant.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Soil<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>There are a wide variety of soils available. Your goal is to get a 
well-balanced soil that holds water but allows for good drainage.</li> 
<li>Do not use native soil &#150; because of possible pathogens and/or weeds.
</li> 
<li>Do not use topsoil &#150; often very heavy.</li> 
<li>The plant determines the type of soil you should use. A cactus needs very 
well drained, sandy soil.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Re-potting<br>
 Plants need re-potting when they start to need water more 
frequently than normal, and when their roots encompass the soil in the pot, 
forming a heavy circle at the base of the plant. Take the plant out of the pot 
and see if you have evidence of root-crowding.<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a good basic potting soil and put rocks in the bottom of the pot and 
then a layer of soil.</li> 
<li>If roots encompass the soil mass, cut them from top to bottom in 3 or 4 
spots.</li> 
<li>Pot up into the next size pot (example: a 6 inch pot re-pots into an 8 
inch pot).</li> 
<li>Don't plant deeper than it was in the previous pot.</li> 
<li>Be sure sides are filled with soil, press gently, then rap bottom of pot 
on hard surface several times to get out air pockets.</li> 
<li>Water thoroughly until it runs through the drainage hole.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Plant Grooming<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Shape the plant by pruning, or pinching back the growing tips.</li> 
<li>Prune out damaged or sick areas. The plant will then put energy into new 
growth.</li> 
<li>Remove faded blooms so energy goes back into flower production.</li> 
<li>Occasionally wash leaves with water and a soft sponge so the plant's 
stomata are clear.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>By knowing your home or office light intensity you can pick a plant for any 
corner of your home or office. Then meet the other requirements such as 
temperature, humidity, and proper watering and you'll have your own interior 
plant success story!</p> 
<p>Our goal is to help you be successful by helping you choose the right plant 
for your home or office and to answer questions you might have about keeping 
them looking good long term.</p> 
<p>We offer many long lasting interior landscape floor plants, hanging plants 
and a good variety of 3 and 4-inch plants for dish gardens and windowsills. In 
addition, we have a constantly changing selection of flowering plants, cactus, 
succulents and citrus plants, depending on the season. Later in the spring we 
have the larger tropical orange trees, lemon, tangerine, and hibiscus trees so 
you can really create a tropical paradise in your home.</p> 
<p>If you don't see the plant you are searching for, please ask: we will try 
to find it for you.</p> <br>
