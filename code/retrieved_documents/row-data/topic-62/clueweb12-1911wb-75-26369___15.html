<h2>How to avoid getting planted by fashionable gardening</h2> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p>Starting with the basic premise that what people grow in their own gardens 
is their own business, it has to be said that both style and technology intrude 
if they get the chance. Given the vast advances in biological science, the 
desire to play God can&rsquo;t be far away. There&rsquo;s an insidious tendency 
on the part of the industry to intrude with novelties, gadgets, and the sort of 
hack advertising that makes people think they can&rsquo;t live without them. As 
discussed above, the normal version of this is tiresome d&eacute;cor, soggy 
management-seminar level orientation to design concepts, and a supply of third 
rate materials.</p> 
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t warning enough, consider:</p> 
<p>1. Everything ever designed as a consumer item usually turns out to be 
substandard.</p> 
<p>2. Virtually everything in a normal household can be lethal with a little 
effort.</p> 
<p>3. All of the above is expensive to maintain, repair, and operate.</p> 
<p>4. Anything not covered by case law or statutes can drag on for years. </p> 
<p>None of which has prevented the daily flood of consumer goods being rammed 
delicately into everyone&rsquo;s lives. On of the big selling points of 
anything is that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo;. The need to have the latest of 
everything is probably the best possible example of a social inferiority 
complex applied in practice. In gardening, this syndrome has branched out 
recklessly into Chic Gardening, the pursuit of novelty at any price. Primulas 
able to sing<em>The Hallelujah Chorus</em> are only a punnet away. Privet 
hedges able to park the car and lawns able to mow themselves while conducting 
ballet classes may be safely assumed to be on their way.</p> 
<p>Actually putting a bit more absurdity into modern life does have a few 
things to recommend it.</p> 
<p>Consider the possibilities of one of your more bovine acquaintances trying 
to tame a jazz-playing lavender. A car salesman earnestly explaining the 
benefits of All Wheel Drive to a petunia. Your sedge getting arrested for 
shoplifting. You could make a fortune in chat show appearances discussing 
what&rsquo;s likely to happen to the plumber when the Agapanthus realized he 
was disconnecting the outlet from the bathroom.</p> 
<p>But&hellip;</p> 
<p>Does one want to live among the idiocies of consumerism? Entertaining as 
the sight of a tree devouring a suburb is, surely we could do more to enhance 
the life of the tree than just allowing it to play with any old rubbish. The 
lavender might well be the next Mingus, and the petunia a better motorist than 
most. The sedge could become a sort of clumpy Robin Hood, and the Agapanthus 
could make the most wanted list look a bit nicer, but is that all we expect 
from designer plants, to merely make do with suburbia as a venue?</p> 
<p>One of the problems with Chic Anything is that it&rsquo;s usually Chic 
devoid of practicalities. In terms of the garden, it&rsquo;s also usually Chic 
lacking anything useful or tolerable. In the arts, Chic is normally a synonym 
for insufferable. While forgivable in anyone with any talent under about 25, 
the conceit is a bit much for the art lover.</p> 
<p>Ergo the garden lover is usually a bit less than impressed with the normal 
run of Chic Everythings, even in the normal forms. The &ldquo;new&rdquo; rose 
is a transparent mix of older cultivars, and the name, &ldquo;Smarmy Goo 
Goo&rdquo; lacks a certain poise. The Black Spot factory seems to be much the 
same, and the thing may or may not flower properly. This wonderful product is 
inevitably the latest thing in rose design. It has been praised more than the 
latest hit movie, and credited with saving lives and starting a few cults, and 
it&rsquo;s still rubbish. The main selling point remains that it&rsquo;s new, 
not that it&rsquo;s any sort of actual improvement.</p> 
<p>In all honesty, anything really Chic usually starts as a sort of accident. 
Cookery is a case in point. A bit of incinerated mammoth translated into a 
major industry and the cause of more sincere cursing than any commercial ever 
run. Fake Chic is usually the result of some sleazy desire to flog merchandise, 
and it shows. Like Pop Art, it has no depth and no basis. Care to guess what 
90% of Chic is, at any given moment in history?</p> 
<p>So it follows that Chic Gardening is going to be a horror of epic vistas. A 
plant that looks like a hamburger or a can of soup isn&rsquo;t impossible, 
it&rsquo;s just that nobody with sufficient lack of taste and class has yet 
evolved to produce them.Nor is it impossible that something with leaves like 
Van Gogh&rsquo;s<em>Wheatfield With Crows</em> will be grown for its rustic 
charm, and dear tiny little flowers that look like price tags.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that modern design tends to come in outcrops. There 
will be an architectural Renaissance, followed by a d&eacute;cor revolution, 
followed by cheesy packaging innovations. You can start in a life of soap 
operatic innocence in your Gothic apartment eating gruel and wearing things 
that look anonymous in crowds. You then progress to living in something very 
like a Necro Diner eating slop amid that original lifeless modern supermarket 
look most of the Baby Boom generation grew up in, and wearing the results of 
advanced alcoholism. In middle age you advance to the wholesome cheapness that 
only real architectural mediocrity can hope to achieve, eating something 
requiring a degree in food technology to understand and wearing the aberrations 
of fashion designers whose shoes are smarter than they are. In old age you 
progress still further into the depths of lifestyle among the restful shades of 
places designed specifically for those who need to be containerized. You eat a 
balanced diet of medications and occasionally something which might 
theoretically be digestible. You wear by now only what&rsquo;s comfortable.</p> 
<p>In gardening, the equivalent is a sort of Grow Your Own Cliche, and that's 
where Chic Gardening really hits top gear. The fun is programmed, the plants 
are usually neurotic things that believe their own publicity, even if nobody 
else does, and the result is Chic Atrocity.<br>
</p> 
<p>Seems to me that you might as well start by making yourself comfortable, 
and simply ignore the rest of the process. As land sizes relative to buildings 
shrink, and the laughable mentalities of those who design living space becomes 
more infected with the belief that everyone lives in a sitcom with compulsory 
squalor, the garden has become something which is seen more as art deco than a 
design feature. Chic Gardening tends to reflect this inferior thinking.</p> 
<p>So you see the beginnings of Neo Garden Art. Sometimes unkindly and 
inaccurately referred to as Train Set Planning, the hideous procedure of 
Neatness settles in. Add to this the invention of increasingly garish and 
unnatural garden features, and you can assume that senility of the species is 
well advanced. A &ldquo;piece&rdquo; will appear, a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; like 
a table setting, will slither into the postage stamp sized garden area. Usually 
it will be known by some restrained market description like Cosmic Phallus, or 
Credit Card Symbiote, and look like the remains of a car accident. It will be 
made by some hitherto unknown genius called Gushette Maximus, and be duly 
revered as a breakthrough in domestic life, the entrance of Culture onto the 
previously barren stage of human existence. If this unavoidable eyesore is a 
plant, it will inevitably be the most daring thing in gardening since plastic 
daisies. It will be written up for centuries afterward as a symbol of the great 
artistic masters of the day.</p> 
<p>Jerome K Jerome, author of <em>Three Men In A Boat</em>, (If you 
haven&rsquo;t read it, rush out immediately and get a copy. If nothing else it 
will explain England to you. Nothing else will...) wrote about the domestic 
horrors of his day, including the revered Willow Pattern in much the same way. 
He wondered if the commonplaces of his day would become hallowed a hundred 
years from then. I was reading him almost exactly a hundred years later, and I 
can see what he meant. It is a process of acceptance, the valuing of things as 
what they represent, not what they actually are. He wondered if Willow Pattern 
would be revered 100 years from 1888.</p> 
<p>(I&rsquo;m actually eating ANZAC biscuits out of a Willow Pattern saucer as 
I write&hellip; fate, eh? The Willow Pattern has since degenerated into a 
rather tacky imitation of its original self, a mere series of smears under the 
glaze, no life or personality in them. I got lucky and found an old piece that 
actually looks like real Willow Pattern.)</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a fairly good analysis of the design process. Chic Gardening 
takes advantage of both the marketing and the fact that anything old enough is 
usually considered &ldquo;art&rdquo;, however bloody awful it is. Arguably no 
form of artistic pretension could survive without it. It&rsquo;s just that the 
human race brings this unspeakable irritant with itself wherever it goes. Hence 
the remains of some gruesome excess will sit in the garden for centuries, in 
some cases, protected by archaeologists and other masochists.</p> 
<p>My father was an industrial designer, among other things, so I&rsquo;m not 
quite so impressed with this mongrelization of ideas. I know they&rsquo;re not 
new.<em>Venus Rising From The Styrofoam</em> doesn&rsquo;t strike me as 
particularly inspiring, or inspired. Nor does a garden shed looking like the 
Sistine Chapel and costing as much necessarily transport me to Valhalla. 
Nevertheless, even a professional cynic who practices regularly will look at 
something &ldquo;new&rdquo; because it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;, at least in theory.
</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the trap. Where the wallet goes, the mind will 
follow&hellip;&hellip;eventually. Chic Gardening generally dumps large amounts 
of new looks, new shapes, new products, and new books about itself onto the 
gardener. That they lack substance is obvious, but look at what&rsquo;s 
happened. Centuries&rsquo; worth of perfectly good, reliable ceramic pots have 
been replaced by seconds&rsquo; worth of bland little plastic things. The 
slightly prudish garden statuary has been supplanted by<em>Obj</em>&eacute;<em>
ts De Anonymous</em>, personality-less things with no known purpose or aesthetic
</p> 
<p>The culture creates the art, which is rather a pity. Whole generations are 
raised in the squalid piles of concrete we are told are normal human 
habitations called cities.&Acirc;&nbsp; The mental restrictions are arguably 
much worse, and they're the basis of Garden Art as it is now called, blending 
with an unspeakable environment.<br>
</p> 
<p>We appreciate&hellip;.sometimes, if we can.It's just that I'm pretty sure 
the basic idea of gardening isn't to provide a wreath for the funeral of human 
aesthetics.<br>
</p> 
<p>The art analogy isn&rsquo;t entirely misplaced. Art suffers from the 
artist, as well as the aficionado. Art is often misrepresented as something it 
simply isn&rsquo;t. Cultural events, art exhibits or gardens, are occasionally 
touted as tours de force when they&rsquo;re really tours de farce. The 
thunderous rote praise is usually an omen of the mediocrity to come.</p> 
<p>People have every right to their own aesthetic values, and I&rsquo;ll never 
say otherwise. However, there are some chic gardening motifs that deserve to be 
questioned:</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>The Modern Desert With Flowerpots.</strong></p> 
<p>The pot garden can be a lot of fun, and can be done truly brilliantly. It 
is also unique for its ability to completely defeat its own purpose.Chic 
gardening invariably includes a range of pots which are probably better for 
attracting fungi and diseases than growing anything but excuses.<br>
</p> 
<p>Unless a major breakthrough in the construction of really intelligent 
flowerpots happens soon, pots have their limits. The pitiful spectacle of a pot 
bound plant is so familiar and so obvious that I&rsquo;m wary of mentioning it, 
but pots will kill plants as efficiently as neglect.</p> 
<p>Plants naturally don&rsquo;t grow in pots. They don&rsquo;t have credit 
cards so they can go to the nursery and buy their own, so they&rsquo;ve learned 
to make do without. The pot is a potential prison. A life sentence, or a death 
sentence, in fact, if the gardener isn&rsquo;t careful.</p> 
<p>Some pots are truly useless; the cheapo variety, thin black plastic, are 
genuinely dangerous for the plant. The roots will cook with a bit of help from 
the black plastic, if left in the sun. (Metal planters are equally deadly, and 
dangerous to you, too, if heated up enough.)</p> 
<p>Thin plastic <em>anything </em>is well worth avoiding in pots, however 
chic. Better quality pots are thicker, with a feel of real durability.</p> 
<p>Terra cotta is generally reliable, and breathes better, allowing some 
movement of air and water when the potting mix isn&rsquo;t impacted, but they 
are very heavy and very breakable, and should only be handled by those that 
know how.The &quot;Spanish look&quot; can give you a hernia. It may be chic, 
but it's growing more chiropractors than plants. Use a hand truck.<br>
</p> 
<p>Big pots should be handled by those who are insured. Weight is a real 
issue, particularly after watering.Some plants must have large pots, and you'll 
be astonished to hear that most of the more fashionable big pots are useless as 
anything but shop displays.</p> 
<p><strong>Indoor chic </strong><br>
</p> 
<p>Size does matter. Small pots are for small plants. They can also make small 
plants out of big plants, and do enough damage to make repotting a real 
problem. Anyone who&rsquo;s ever tried to unravel a pot bound plant knows the 
story.The equation is &quot;plant first, decorative values of pot last&quot;.
<br></p> 
<p>Pot plants in unsuitable containers can get sick pretty easily. You can 
slaughter all your plants by weakening a pot plant to the extent it gets a 
disease and passes it on to the others.</p> 
<p>Even the fertilizer trade has its uncharacteristic chic moments, 
particularly with indoor pot plants. Using a lot of whizzbang nutrients is a 
great way of growing molds and fungi, and with a little effort a healthy crop 
of mysterious afflictions will keep you very busy and help keep your asthma and 
hay fever feeling appreciated.</p> 
<p><strong>The Deco Garden</strong></p> 
<p>The idea of garden d&eacute;cor has been a great boon to those that sell 
garden d&eacute;cor, and almost nobody else. Between modern sculptures, 
charming bric-a-brac and entirely forgettable odds and sods, the only thing 
that can be safely said is that it prevents cluttering up the garden with 
plants.</p> 
<p>There is an interminable supply of Little Things To Hang About The Garden, 
and Designer Planters for that primary school look.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s <em>your</em> garden. If nothing makes you happier than to have 
a plaster something-or-other sitting in the ivy, please have one. Have many. 
Otherwise most of this stuff is about as useful as a whale in a bathtub, and 
far less interesting. Have what you<em>like</em>, not what is thrust upon you. 
Therein the essence of motifs.</p> 
<p><strong>The Machine Garden. </strong></p> 
<p>No, not a supply of cars being fixed in the back yard, but a programmed 
garden, growing according to a plan. As mentioned above, there are plenty of 
arguments in favor of at least looking at design ideas through a computer.</p> 
<p><em>But</em>- there&rsquo;s something irritating about the predictable. 
From predictable to dull as a fence post is a very small step. It also achieves 
the straitjacket effect of preventing much else being done. If you live in a 
place where you have scope to design, remember that you might want to design 
something else sometime, too. Ideas have to grow, too.</p> 
<p><strong>Formality uber alles. </strong></p> 
<p>There is a theory which I&rsquo;ve been spreading that formal gardens are a 
sort of efficient masochism. Like wearing a tuxedo to breakfast, there is a 
degree of &ldquo;demanding self image&rdquo; placed on the gardener. The formal 
styles are out of fashion these days, and one of the reasons for that is that 
they are unbelievably expensive, and require a technical expertise that few 
people either have or can afford. They are<em>the</em> incarnate form of garden 
perfectionism. They can also be rather an atavism, something out of its time.
</p> 
<p>They were designed to cater for large areas, like the Palace Of Versailles, 
and the smaller chic versions tend to look window-box-like. An array of plants 
in formal rows looks great en masse, in a large setting, but it&rsquo;s not the 
same, jammed against the garage, sandwiched between the car and the hose. If 
you don't happen to have a Palace of Versailles, consider other options.<br>

</p> 
<p>Uniformity is a rarity in gardens these days, and with good reason. People 
don&rsquo;t have the space to play with, and they want to look at more than one 
plant. The serried ranks of daffodils were an icon once, but even then they 
were set amid other features. Chic gardening now produces images which are 
related to formal gardening, and require an army to grow and maintain. Avoid.
<br></p> 
<p>Formal gardens emphasize their own failures, too. A few plants missing is a 
conceptual disaster. Even the shapes are arcane. The garden palette is made not 
only formal but symmetrical, and the mind is as likely to just see the symmetry 
and ignore it,<em>because</em> it&rsquo;s too deliberately symmetrical, as it 
is to look further. Repetition makes the mind less interested. Chic gardening, 
like commercials, works on the predictability as the garden's raison d'etre, 
believe it or not. Anyone can be persuaded they know what they're doing if it's 
banal enough.<br>
</p> 
<p>If you want to be an chic gardener, make sure it&rsquo;s <em>your</em> idea 
of chic, not the marketing industry&rsquo;s latest attempt to prove it&rsquo;s 
ever seen a plastic daisy.</p>
