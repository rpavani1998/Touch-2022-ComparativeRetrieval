<h2>THU HA COFFEE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE</h2>Click on Company Name above for more 
detailed information!<br>
<br>
Thu Ha Coffee is one of the leading coffee 
brands in Vietnam. The key to the development and success of Thu Ha Coffee has 
been the incredible quality, wonderful taste, and reasonable prices of our 
products, and Thu Ha Coffee brand has been accepted in EU, USA, Japan, Korea, 
Taiwan. Yet, because we are a local brand, many are unaware of our long 
history, and far too few have had the unique experience of enjoying a freshly 
brewed cup of Thu Ha Coffee amongst the beauty of the Central Highlands of Viet 
Nam.<br>
<br>
Producing that memorable cup of coffee is a complex process, with 
no two tastes being the same. Thus, a thorough knowledge of regional tastes is 
essential to please people's varied preferences. Vietnamese, for instance, 
favor a bitter sweet taste which is not sour. While, Western preferences run to 
a more plain tasting coffee that is pure and mild.<br>
<br>
At Thu Ha Coffee we 
strive to produce coffee that will give you that perfect cup of java. It is a 
labor of love, something of which we are extremely proud; for honesty, purity, 
and producing great tasting coffee remain at the center of our core company 
values. Thu Ha Coffee is, and will always be, a 100% pure, natural product. 
When you buy Thu Ha brand coffee you can be confident that it will contain only 
our pure coffee, with its signature bitter sweet taste. A delight to the senses 
and never a disappointment!<br>
<br>
At Thu Ha Coffee we are with decades of 
experience in the coffee trade, we understand that there are different tastes 
and budgets when it comes to coffee. To meet those needs we have developed 12 
different coffees; ten for Vietnamese preferences and five for our foreign 
customers. Prices range from low to high, but the quality is always excellent, 
and we know that you will find a type that suits you. <br>
