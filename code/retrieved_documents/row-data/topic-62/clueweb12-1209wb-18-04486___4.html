<p><b>&quot;Pots&quot;</b> is a simple word to embrace the myriad shapes and 
sizes of containers in which plants may be grown, from a miniature bonsai pot 
to a large urn or barrel, from hollow logs to drain pipes ! A pot may be an 
artistic statement or merely a utensil to house a plant until it is ready to be 
placed in the ground. The pot is one of the oldest known utensils when pottery 
and metals were first part of human industry. The flower pot is one of the most 
ancient forms of gardening, having been found in the ruins of ancient 
Mediterranean cities, and in ancient Biblical references. The variety of plants 
is as great as the range of containers. Many native plants are suited to 
container growing.</p> 
<p><b>What are the advantages?</b></p> 
<p>People who live in confined inner city areas of in apartment blocks, with 
little or no garden area, can enjoy a wide range of native plants. balconies 
and courtyards can be enlivened by a potted garden. Window boxes, a very old 
form of gardening, have regained popularity. It is possible to design a total 
landscape in a small space. Containers can provide a portable garden, ideal for 
those who are renting a home. When they move they can take their favourite 
plants with them. The elderly and those with limited mobility can enjoy the 
beauty and fragrance of a garden and the exercise that comes with caring for 
it. Containers are also used in larger gardens for their versatility. They can 
be moved around to take advantage of sun or shade, given a prominent position 
when flowering, and taken indoors when at their best. They add interest to 
leisure areas<b>&quot;Difficult&quot;</b> or fussy plants can be kept in pots 
to provide the most suitable soil and growing conditions.</p> 
<p><b>Special Uses</b></p> 
<p>Special uses of containers include indoor or house plants and the art of <b>
BONSAI</b>. Selecting a Container: The container can be any receptacle that 
holds soil, as long as it has good drainage. The right selection is important 
from the aesthetic and the practical point of view. Its style and size must be 
suited to the plant and to its site, blending with the ambience of its 
surroundings. It should not detract from the plant. There needs to be space for 
the roots to grow, but the plant must be in proportion. Pots can be terracotta, 
ceramic, plastic, or wood. Terracotta's earthy colour suits native plants but 
it is porous. For this reason, mixes such as<b>DEBCO TERRACOTTA AND TUB MIX</b>
, or<b>AMGROW SHRUB AND TUB</b>, should be used. Cement pots should be used 
carefully because of their lime content. Plastic pots can be sued as liners for 
both cement, and terracotta pots.</p> 
<p><b>Growing Requirements</b></p> 
<p>Containers impose obvious restrictions on the root systems of plants. In 
the garden, roots are able to exploit a large volume of soil to obtain moisture 
and nutrients. In containers, there is a limited volume of soil providing 
nutrients and moisture, and drainage and aeration are reduced compared with the 
same soil in the garden. Prepared potting mixes available from your<b>Greengold 
Garden Centre</b>, are the easiest and cheapest source of potting soil. Beware 
of cheap potting mixes - it is a false economy to buy a good plant, and expect 
it to grow happily in cheap potting mix. Buy a mix with Australian Standards 
accreditation, and for porous containers, choose a specialised mix, with high 
moisture retaining properties.<b>Never Use Earth From the Garden in Pots.</b> 
</p> 
<p><b>Watering</b></p> 
<p>Incorrect watering causes many losses with container grown plants. Wait 
until the surface 1 to 2 cm of soil is dry before re-watering. Apply water 
gently- thoroughly soaking the soil.<b>Do Not Leave Pots Standing In Water</b>. 
Plants on patios, or in courtyards should be raised to allow water to drain 
freely and to hinder snails and other pests.</p> 
<p><b>Never Let a Pot Sit in a Saucer of Water ...</b></p> 
<p>This causes the mix in the bottom of the container to turn sour, and 
ultimately the loss of the plant.<b>Feeding:</b> Plants in containers need more 
frequent fertilising for moderate but healthy growth. The best time is just 
after flowering.<b>DO NOT</b> feed if the plant is growing well. There is a 
wide variety of fertilisers available -<b>Osmocote</b> for natives is a useful 
slow release fertiliser, and Nitrosol used as directed for natives, is 
recommended as a liquid fertiliser. Avoid fertilisers high in phosphorous as 
many natives are sensitive to this.<b>Repotting:</b> If plants lack vigour and 
do not respond to watering and feeding, repotting is desirable, using fresh 
potting mix. Carefully trim the roots, and prune the branchlets to compensate 
for root loss, and to neaten or reshape. Wash the pot thoroughly before 
re-using. Some general pruning is necessary for container plants. Regular pinch 
pruning of terminal growth is the easiest and best method.<b>Pruning:</b> Some

<p><b>Choice of Plants</b></p> 
<p>Consider first the location, whether it is in sun or shade and the effect 
you wish to create. Choose plants which are long-flowering or group together, 
either in large containers, or in coordinated smaller ones, varieties which are 
complementary and will bloom successively over a long period.</p> 
<p>One of the most popular genus in their choices is Boronia. Many people say 
that there is probably nothing more appealing than the display provided by well 
grown plants in hanging baskets: They add beauty to many situation, both 
indoors and out, and the flowers and foliage are often better appreciated since 
they occur at eye level. They can add life to blank walls and fences, pergolas 
and verandahs, and are ideal for people with little space available for 
gardening or for pots.</p> 
<p><b>Types of Baskets</b></p> 
<p>The most basic and the commonest is the wireframe lined with paperbark or 
wool. Yates have introduced the Woolrich liner made from new Australian wool 
which they claim aids water retention and insulates the roots. Liners have a 
limited life but by the time they have broken down repotting is usually 
necessary anyway. Plastic containers with their own saucers can be purchased in 
a wide range of styles and colours. Some have self-watering systems, A variety 
of ceramic pots are available but these can prove very heavy and care must be 
taken in securing them to upright supports. Hooks and pulleys can be used to 
make baskets more accessible.</p> 
<p><b>Potting Mixes</b></p> 
<p> Some special mixes are available for baskets. These generally include 
water-retention crystals and some mixes contain a lot of plastic foam to reduce 
the weight. Vermiculite or perlite also decrease the weight and are better soil 
conditioners. Give the container a good soaking after planting and allow it to 
drain before hanging.</p> 
<p><b>Plant Care</b></p> 
<p> Baskets require frequent water checks so that they don't dry out. 
Nutrients in the soil are leached out by watering more quickly in a hanging 
container so regular feeding is beneficial. Once or twice a year when plants 
are in active growth give a light application of a slow-release fertiliser 
suitable for natives. Periodic repotting is necessary for healthy nutrient 
levels.</p>
