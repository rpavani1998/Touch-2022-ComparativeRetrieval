<h1>A Cure for Cancer?</h1> 
<p><b>&quot;Give me three weeks and your oncologist will cancel your surgery! 
Learn how to identify and remove what causes your cancer -- your body will do 
the rest. No conflict with any clinical treatment.&quot;<br>

<p><b>The Cure for all Cancers</b><br>
<b>Hulda Regehr Clark, Ph.D.,N.D.</b>
<br> <br>
 Dr. Clark claims that all cancers are caused by a single common 
parasite. This parasite becomes established in the liver when it reacts with 
accumulations of a common solvent (which is in many processed foods and 
personal products).<br>

<h1> Abstract </h1> 
<p> Electricity can now be used to kill bacteria, viruses and parasites in 
minutes, not days or weeks as antibiotics require.</p> 
<p> If you have been suffering from a chronic infection or have cancer, or 
AIDS, learn to build the electronic device that will stop it immediately. It is 
safe and without side effects and does not interfere with any treatment you are 
now on.</p>

<h1> Acknowledgments </h1> 
<p> I would like to express my gratitude to my son, Geoffrey, who always 
listened to my &quot;crazy ideas&quot; on Sundays, right at supper time. He was 
patient, kind, helpful and willing to share his expertise in electronics and 
computers. Without him, this book could not have been written.</p> 
<p> A big thank you goes to Frank Jerome, DDS. Without the loan of his 
parasite slide collection many of my discoveries could not have been make, and 
without his development of metal-free dentistry, many of these patient 
histories could not have ended happily. Thank you to Linda Jerome for nurturing 
us both with personal interest and patience. And thank you to Edna Bernstein 
for her resourceful assistance.</p> 
<h1> Dedication </h1> 
<p> I would like to dedicate this book to all the persons who visited me 
professionally, from the very first person in 1963, Mrs. R. Biehl, to the 
present. I learned so much from each of you and I appreciate your confidence, 
your intelligence and your reluctance to be defeated.</p> 
<h1> Notice to the Reader </h1> 
<p> The opinions and conclusions expressed in this book are mine, and unless 
expressed otherwise, mine alone. The opinions expressed herein are based on my 
scientific research and on specific case studies involving my patients. Be 
advised that every person is unique and may respond differently to the 
treatments described in this book. On occasion we have provided dosage 
recommendations where appropriate. Again, remember that we are all different 
and any new treatment should be applied in a cautious, common sense fashion.</p>
<p> The treatments outlined herein are not intended to be a replacement or 
substitute for other forms of conventional medical treatment. Please feel free 
to consult with your physician or other health care provider.</p> 
<p> I have indicated throughout this book the existence of pollutants in food 
and other products. These pollutants were identified using a testing device of 
my invention known as the Syncrometer. Complete instructions for building and 
using this device are contained in this book. Therefore anyone can repeat the 
tests described and verify the data.</p> 
<p> The Syncrometer is more accurate and versatile than the best existing 
testing methods. A method for determining the degree of precision is also 
presented. However at this point it only yields positive or negative results, 
it does not quantify. The chance of a false positive or a false negative is 
about 5%, which can be lessened by test repetition.</p> 
<p> It is in the public interest to know when a single bottle of a single 
product tests positive to a serious pollutant. If one does, the safest course 
is to avoid all bottles of that product entirely, which is what I repeatedly 
advise. These recommendations should be interpreted as an intent to warn and 
protect the public, not to provide a statistically significant analysis. It is 
my fervent hope that manufacturers use the new electronic techniques in this 
book to make surer products than they ever have before.</p>

<h1> Preface </h1> 
<p> The sick have been held hostage for their money or intangible assets since 
time immemorial. Doctors, even primitive and natural healers, surround 
themselves with mystery as they use herbs or chemicals and incantations or 
&quot;prognoses&quot; to help the sick recover. Today, the medical industry 
(doctors and their suppliers and insurers) take a significant amount of the 
worker's earnings. Wouldn't it be nice if they could all go back to gardening 
or some other primitive and useful endeavor? Wouldn't it be wonderful if the 
sick could join them?</p> 
<p> The most promising discovery in this book is the effectiveness of 
electricity to kill viruses, bacteria and parasites. Does this mean you can 
cancel your appointment with your clinical doctor? No it does not. Killing your 
invaders does not make you well instantly. But happily, at your next doctor 
visits she or he will be removing drugs, not adding them.</p> 
<p> You might think that such an invention should be quickly patented. That 
was my universal advice. But I chose not to. It helps me, my children, and my 
grandchildren, if you are well. The whole world needs to come out of the dark 
ages of medicine and illness. And to learn the true causes of infection and 
disease. We must and can usher in the new age of disease-free living.</p> 
<p> No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no cancer, no HIV/AIDS, no migraines, 
no lupus and so on!</p> 
<p> Not a single disease is left unconquerable with this new understanding! 
</p> 
<h1> The Promise </h1> 
<pre> Step into a new world. A world without chronic diseases. Step out of 
your old world. It has kept you a prisoner. Try something new. The prison has 
no walls. It has only lines. Lines that mark the ground around you. Inside the 
lines are your old ideas. Outside are new ideas that invite you to step over 
and escape your prison. Dare to try these new ideas and your illness promises 
to recede. In a few weeks it can be gone.</pre> 
<p> If you are very ill or chronically ill you must have asked yourself many 
times: why have these problems chosen me? Will there never be a way to conquer 
them?</p> 
<p> You may be quite familiar with your doctor's explanation of your illness 
or your child's illness. A Coxsackie virus has entered your child's brain 
causing inflammation (encephalitis) there. You pray that your child's immunity 
will overcome it. You may be familiar, but so very helpless against this 
microscopic invader.</p> 
<p> If you had the proverbial 3 wishes they would be: 1) please spare my 
child's life; 2) please make it so my child doesn't have permanent damage; 3) 
please bless and guide the wonderful doctors and nurses who are keeping the 
oxygen tent going, and are watching my child's temperature and vital signs.</p> 
<p> What if you could turn a dial and in 3 minutes kill every Coxsackie virus 
in your child's body?</p> 
<p> What if this had no side effects? </p> 
<p> What if the virus never came back? </p> 
<p> In this book you will learn how to do that. You will also learn why your 
child got encephalitis or other disease and how to prevent it forever.</p> 
<p> If this is too mind boggling, just take it a step at a time: </p> 
<p> First, learn about the radio-type broadcasting that all living animals do. 
Second, find the &quot;station frequencies&quot; that your particular 
invader(s) broadcast at. Third, learn how to &quot;jam&quot; their frequency 
until they expire: it takes only minutes!</p> 
<p> Finally, learn how to make your own diagnostic and treatment devices. The 
instructions are simple enough for anyone. Only by putting this power in your 
hands will it be safe from government regulation, however well intended.</p> 
<h2> Only Two Health Problems </h2> 
<p> No matter how long and confusing is the list of symptoms a person has, 
from chronic fatigue to infertility to mental problems, I am sure to find only 
two things wrong: they have in them pollutants and/or parasites. I never find 
lack of exercise, vitamin deficiencies, hormone levels or anything else to be a 
primary causative factor. So the solution to good health is obvious:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> Problem | Simplest Cure ----------+--------------------------------- 
Parasites | Electronic and herbal treatment Pollution | Avoidance</pre> 
<p> It's a valiant quest: The quest for health. With optimism in one hand and 
determination in the other, you too can work the miracles for yourself that my 
clients accomplished in the case histories.</p> 
<p> More good news is that it is not expensive. The cost will range from a few 
hundred dollars to only a few thousand in order to eliminate both problems and 
cure your chronic diseases.</p> 
<h2> Be A Health Detective </h2> 
<p> After curing your own diseases, teach your friends and family how it's 
done. Families are related and their problems are related. This should make the 
task easier. Keep a small notebook to become part of the treasured family 
legacy as much as photographs do. If your aunt, father and brother had diabetes 
as well as yourself and all were cured after introducing them to this concept 
and technology, isn't this worthy of notes in your family's history?</p> 
<p> Notice what a strong line of inheritance there can be, not due to sharing 
genes but due to sharing a roof, a table, a supermarket, and a dentist!</p> 
<p> Many problems can be disinherited. Cure yourself of retinitis pigmentosa, 
Muscular dystrophy (the &quot;inherited&quot; kind), and break down your 
family's faith in the gene-concept for these diseases. Bring hope to your 
family by proving diseases' true etiology. Bring respect back for your loyal 
genes that bring you hair color, and texture, not hair loss. That bring you eye 
color, not eye disease. Your genes brought you the good things about your 
ancestors, not the bad things. Parasites and pollution brought you the bad 
things.</p> 
<p> Killing all your invaders is just the first step, though. It is indeed the 
life-saving step. But getting well is more than saving your life. Next comes 
the more tedious task of finding their sources. Where did they come from? Why 
did they invade you so massively. Why you?</p> 
<p> The story of your personal pollution unfolds as in a book. Look closely 
and you see the whole panorama of your numerous tiny invaders being held at bay 
by your valiant immune system, your white blood cells. You can see what they 
are fighting besides the invaders. Your ill-chosen diet and lifestyle products!
</p> 
<p> Your heart may go out to those tiny white blood cells. Never again, you 
may say, will you give them arsenic and mercury and lead. Never again, cobalt 
and asbestos and freon.</p> 
<p> That great body of wisdom, your body, the same as listened to your three 
wishes, will reward you over and over as you cooperate with it, until you have 
had not 3 but 30 wishes granted, each one seemingly as impossible as climbing 
Mt. Everest.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Your chronic yeast infection can go away.</li> 
<li>Your hair can stop falling out-might even grow back.</li> 
<li>Your body can become pregnant - when you had already given up.</li> 
<li>Your fatigue can vanish.</li> 
<li>Your insomnia can be gone.</li> 
<li>Your warts can fall off.</li> 
<li>Your sight and hearing can sharpen.</li> 
<li>Your constant hunger can disappear.</li> </ul> 
<p> Health isn't just being free of sickness. Health is feeling great, feeling 
like laughing at funny things. Health is feeling grateful to be alive. It is 
feeling happy to see the sky and to see growing things and to feel confident in 
human society's progress. Health is remembering the good parts of childhood and 
believing you still have a lot of them.</p> 
<h1> Pushing Back Age </h1> 
<p> This chapter is a tribute to Jimmy, Nazy, Michele, Suzanne, Marlena and 
all the others who achieved excellence with daily care-taking of Mary Austin, 
deceased at 97.</p> 
<p> It's true that we have to die sometime. But why die before our life span 
is up? If many people can live to 100 years, then surely this is the human life 
span, not three score and ten. Some scientists think the true human life span 
is closer to 140 years! And that we all lead shortened lives. The shortening is 
due to failure of some organ in us. Other organs are dependent on the failing 
organ and begin to fail also. When the brain fails, death occurs, sometimes in 
five minutes.</p> 
<p> If we knew which organ is failing, we could come to its assistance and 
prevent the collapse of the whole body. Often it is easy to see which organ is 
failing. But whether this is the true beginning of the body's problems we 
cannot know. Before death there may have been appetite loss. Before the 
appetite loss there may have been a broken hip. Before the broken hip, 
diziness. Before the dizziness a blood pressure or blood sugar problem. Before 
these, an episode of &quot;flu&quot; or a dental &quot;repair&quot;. Sometimes 
we know what started it all. But often we don't. Just make a guess and begin 
somewhere.</p> 
<h2> Diet </h2> 
<p> If your aging friend or relative is in a home for the elderly, you may be 
able to persuade him or her to choose a diet that is wiser than the average 
diet people eat there. This can help a lot. Just stopping drinking the coffee, 
decaf, iced tea and carbonated beverages that are served, and switching to the 
recipes in this book could get them off some of their medicines.</p> 
<p> The beverages to encourage are sterilized milk and hot water - delicious 
with whipping cream, honey and cinnamon. This gets them away from solvents, 
oxalic acid and caffeine.</p> 
<p> Old age is not a time when you &quot;no longer need milk&quot;. Calcium 
losses increase in old age. Milk has the organic form of calcium, chelated with 
lactic acid, and it has the cream to promote absorption. For this reason, milk 
should never be reduced in fat content (not less than 2%). The cream is 
necessary to improve calcium absorption.</p> 
<p> In old age it is downright dangerous to be taking many calcium tablets. 
The stomach does not have the acid necessary to dissolve them. They pass into 
the intestine, disturbing its function and acid levels. With tablets, too, one 
must be careful with dosages, while food is self limiting. No elderly person 
would be able to drink more than one cup of milk at a time. This contains 250 
mg. of calcium.</p> 
<p> Milk, however, requires stomach acid to curdle it as the first step in 
digestion. If there is not sufficient acid, it will pass undigested into the 
intestine, causing new problems. We must listen to the elderly when they say 
milk gives them gas or other troubles.</p> 
<p> Having the milk warm to hot helps in getting digestion started in the 
stomach. Milk served hot with cinnamon accomplishes two purposes: it will 
stimulate acid secretion and the cinnamon is an insulin aid. Milk served hot 
with honey adds the nutritive value of honey, displacing the need for other 
unnatural sweets. The meal should always include something sour to curdle the 
milk. It does not have to be added to the milk; it can simply be included with 
the meal somewhere.</p> 
<p> Lemon juice or vinegar can be put in certain foods but the most reliable 
way to get it into the diet is to put 1 tablespoon into the water glass along 
with a teaspoon of honey. This gives the water a &quot;sweet and sour&quot; 
flavor, enough to make it interesting throughout the meal. The fresh lemon 
juice or white distilled vinegar and a honey dispenser that is easy to use 
should always be on the table. Bring these two items to your loved one at the 
&quot;home&quot; if it cannot be provided regularly and reliably. Pop in at 
mealtime to check up on it. Powdered vitamin C (l/4 tsp.) is another useful 
acid if the first two are not effective enough.</p> 
<p> The lemon and honey habit, alone, can add years (healthier years) to an 
elderly person. The extra acid taken with lunch and supper (the stomach has its 
own best supply of acid in the morning, for breakfast) improves overall 
digestion and helps dissolve the calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, and 
other minerals in the food so they can be absorbed.</p> 
<p> The habit of using vinegar and honey in water as a beverage was made 
famous by Dr. Jarvis in his book Folk Medicine, circa 1960. He recommended 
apple cider vinegar for its extra potassium. In those days, vinegar was made of 
good apples. Now, all the regular vinegars have mold in them. The toxin, 
patulin, in moldy apples has been carefully studied by scientists. It taints 
the vinegar as well as apple juice and concentrate made from them. I have not 
tested patulin to see if it can be detoxified by vitamin C. We must use only 
white distilled vinegar, even though it lacks potassium, aroma and popularity. 
Using a variety of honeys can make up for the need to vary the flavor. Get 
orange blossom, linden blossom, buckwheat, wildflower, and sage honey, besides 
clover blossom.</p> 
<p> But honey is not perfect food. It usually has ergot mold, a very serious 
toxin. To detoxify the ergot, you simply add vitamin C to the honey as soon as 
it arrives from the supermarket. This gives it plenty of time to react with the 
ergot before you eat it. Bring your &quot;fixed&quot; honeys to the home.</p> 
<p> If your elderly loved one has not tolerated milk in years, start with the 
vinegar and honey beverage, or lemon and honey, and be patient until that is 
accepted. Then add only 1/4 cup milk to the day's diet, (in the morning, on 
homemade cereal). Go up very gradually and only when digestion allows it. Of 
course, the milk must be sterile.</p> 
<p> If it is not sterile the final warming will only increase the bacterial 
count. You must be sure of its sterility. Boil the milk yourself. Near-boiling 
is not hot enough. It must be heated until it bubbles up and almost goes over 
the container for ten seconds. Use a non-metal pot that holds one to two 
quarts. You may throw away the skin. Then cool and refrigerate. Supply it to 
the home, too.</p> 
<p> Milk that is marketed in paper containers that need no refrigeration has 
been sterilized; it is safe.</p> 
<p> Once the body, even an aged body, finds a nutritious food that does not 
cause troubles of its own, it asks for more. Your loved one will accept it and 
drink it without forceful coaxing, if there is no problem with it. As long as 
your loved one tries to avoid drinking it, your challenge is to find the 
problem and solve it. It is not a matter of taste or habit. It is a matter of 
digestibility and lack of toxicity. When your loved one is drinking three cups 
of milk (or buttermilk or whey) a day and three cups of water, there will be no 
room (nor request) for the usual coffee and tea and other bad beverages.</p> 
<p> We all must die of something. But it needn't be a stroke, or heart 
failure, or cancer. Choose what seems to be the most pressing problem to work 
on. Common problems that plague the aged are brain problems, incontinence, bad 
digestion, diabetes, tremor, weakness, feeling cold, sensitivity to noise, 
losing the sense of taste and smell, hearing loss, insomnia, kidney and heart 
failure.</p> 
<h3> Increase Oxygen </h3> 
<p> Brain problems include memory loss, communication deficit, dementia 
(calling things by inappropriate names and saying inappropriate things). The 
brain is simply not getting enough oxygen and food to work right. It is like 
having a pocket calculator with rundown batteries: it will give you wrong 
answers (without telling you they are wrong). Not enough oxygen to the brain is 
the main cause of memory loss, inability to find the right words, getting words 
mixed up and not being able to speak in sentences. You can prove this by 
providing oxygen from a tank; modern equipment is very easy to use and 
inexpensive. If your loved one responds well to a few hours of oxygen, you have 
proof of the problem.</p> 
<p> How can you increase oxygen in the brain? </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the blood vessels wider. </li> 
<li>Increase pressure of blood running through the blood vessels. </li> 
<li>Raise the oxygen level in the air that is breathed. Less carbon dioxide, 
tobacco smoke and auto exhaust. Al1 these, including a gas leak from the pipes 
in the house, compete with oxygen.</li> 
<li>Increase the oxygen delivery system to the brain by raising hemoglobin 
levels. Cure anemia and low iron levels.</li> 
<li>Raise oxygen saturation of blood by keeping body acidity down. </li> 
<li>Correct a slow and irregular heart beat </li> </ol> 
<h3> Niacin </h3> 
<p> Open blood vessels wider by giving niacin. Give it early in the morning, 
upon rising, as soon as the feet are set on the floor. Keep it at the bedside, 
use small capsules or tablets and combine this chore with water drinking. The 
water should not be cold and should have nothing added to make it a beverage. 
(Drinking water within minutes of sitting upright may also move the bowels 
soon.) A 250 mg. time-release niacin tablet (see the Sources chapter) is a good 
choice. The elderly have little side effects. Even the niacin-flush, which 
reddens the face and neck is welcomed since it gives a sensation of warmth.</p> 
<p> The flush is intensified by giving hot liquids or acids (even vitamin C) 
to drink. The flush is reduced by giving cold liquids. The opening of blood 
vessels by niacin only lasts a few hours. If you see it has a good effect on 
your loved one, give several a day. Do not use a prescription variety, since 
they are polluted with heavy metals; use only the brand in the Sources chapter, 
or a brand that you have tested pure. You can freely experiment with niacin to 
find the best dosage and variety; it is not toxic in this amount; but the size 
of the tablet should not turn it into an unpleasant chore. Reduce it if it 
seems too large to swallow. Don't cut tablets in half, the rough edges can 
scratch the throat.</p> 
<p> Hawthorn berry is an herb that opens blood vessels, particularly to the 
heart. Carefully watch the effect on blood pressure when using it.</p> 
<p> Food mold, particularly ergot, has the opposite effect of niacin. Brain 
blood vessels are made narrower, cutting down the oxygen supply. Ergot is a 
common contaminant of grains: don't provide rye or pumpernickel breads or 
crackers. Don't provide wine or other alcoholic beverages; they are too 
contaminated with ergot and aflatoxin. Narrowing the blood vessels in the brain 
can lead to stroke. If you notice an attack of dementia coming, try a niacin 
tablet (100 mg, not timed release) immediately.</p> 
<pre> Figure 34: Alcoholic beverages contain ergot and aflatoxin. Add vitamin 
C (1/8 tsp.) upon opening and wait 10 minutes for it to act.</pre> 
<h3> TIA's, Strokes and Purpura </h3> 
<p> Sometimes, the elderly person is aware of the onset of a brain attack; 
they may see stars or peculiar shapes or lose vision temporarily. These are 
called temporary ischemic attacks (TIA's). Immediately give a 100 mg tablet of 
niacin, 1 gram vitamin C, and a B-complex in this order of importance.</p> 
<p> TIA's are caused by spasming in the brain blood vessels. If this causes 
them to spring a tiny leak somewhere, a part of the brain will not get its 
usual oxygen and nourishment. A stroke results.</p> 
<p> The spasming was probably caused by sorghum molds. Cooking during the 
manufacturing of sorghum syrup kills the mold but its toxic byproducts 
(mycotoxins) are still present. Other syrups may have sorghum added, polluting 
them. Brown sugar is also polluted with sorghum molds, but fortunately you can 
detoxify this mold with vitamin C as usual. Mix well 1/4 tsp powdered vitamin C 
with each new (1 lb.) box of brown sugar.</p> 
<p> Purple patches, like bruises, on the hands or arms of an elderly person 
are called purpura, and is also caused by sorghum molds. It weakens blood 
vessels so they break easily.</p> 
<p> When an elderly person has purpura or TIA'S and the mold source isn't 
obvious, you must track it down. Test in a saliva sample for all the 
sweetenings used recently (at least an hour ago). At the very least, keep notes 
on all the sweeteners being used. Look for a common one at the next attack. 
Never let the trigger food be eaten again.</p> 
<h3> Blood Pressure </h3> 
<p> Increase blood pressure if it is habitually too low. Blood pressures below 
110 may prevent strokes but ruin the quality of life. Low blood pressures are 
often due to toxins from foods. But severe salt deprivation in the diet can 
also cause this. If the adrenal glands are not conserving salt properly, too 
much sodium is allowed to leave the body with the urine, resulting in low 
sodium levels in the blood and a blood pressure drop. Adrenal performance is 
improved by taking the kidney herb recipe.</p> 
<p> The kidney herbs (page 549), at half dose level (1/2 cup a day instead of 
a whole cup) can be given daily for three weeks and then on alternate days 
indefinitely. Be very careful to keep the herbal tea sterile by reheating. 
Elderly people seem to sense the improvement given by kidney herbs. Try other 
kidney herbs from time to time: shave grass, cedar berries, juniper berries, 
butcher's broom, cornsilk. None interfere with drugs. Remember, they also have 
a diuretic effect. Be prepared to use extra paper padding in underwear to help 
catch the extra urine output. The first few nights may be disturbed by extra 
urination. Interpret this positively.</p> 
<p> After the blood pressure comes up to 115 (systolic) mental performance 
will be greatly improved. Don't try to bring it up to 120 since this raises the 
stroke potential without giving you much improvement in performance. Use an 
electronic device to measure blood pressure, one with a finger cuff, not an arm 
cuff which can itself induce broken blood vessels. Purchase a device that needs 
no adjustments of any kind and has automatic cuff tension control (see mail 
order catalogs if your pharmacy does not have one).</p> 
<h3> Air Pollution </h3> 
<p> Improve the quality of the air by lowering the pollution level. Check into 
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, fumes from a gas stove pilot light, auto 
exhaust from an attached garage or nearby highway, arsenic from household 
pesticide, PVC from new plastic curtains or carpeting, formaldehyde from 
wearing new clothing before washing it, asbestos from hair dryers, freon from a 
refrigerator, fiberglass, and chlorine from running tap water. Some of these 
displace oxygen, some are simply toxic to the body and lungs. Clean up the air 
according to the general principles of environmental cleanup (see the Four 
Clean-ups chapter, page 409).</p> 
<p> For the elderly pay special attention to chlorine in the air. Shower water 
puts a lot of chlorine into the bathroom air which then distributes itself 
through the rest of the house. Notice whether your elderly person goes into the 
bathroom in fair shape mentally but comes out confused, unreasonable. Not every 
day's chlorine exposure will have the same effect. Trust your judgment. Attach 
a carbon filter to the shower head (see the Sources chapter). Purchase a 
variety that has very simple-to-replace cartridges. Figure out how long it 
should last and write the date for replacement on the outside of it for your 
own convenience.</p> 
<pre> When into and out of the bathroom is a different performance suspect 
chlorine. Put a filter on your faucets. Figure 35. Chlorinated water can cause 
mental symptoms.</pre> 
<p> Washing hands and face in chlorinated water can give off enough chlorine 
to trigger a manic episode in a manic-depressive person. Certainly, it is 
enough to cause mental effects in an elderly person. Of course, the chlorine 
bleach bottle should not be kept under the sink. It should be kept in a closed 
plastic bag in the garage. It should not be used while the elderly person is in 
the house and never for his or her laundry. Use chlorine-free bleach.</p> 
<p> Don't pollute the air with fresh flowers, potpourris, or room fresheners. 
These can induce a dizzy spell.</p> 
<p> Room air conditioners may have a fiberglass filter! This fills the house 
with tiny particles of glass to be breathed by everybody. The body makes tumors 
out of them in order to stop them from cutting through your tissue. Replace the 
filter with a foam sheet. This sheet is 1/8 inch thick and washable. I have not 
found these types of foam filters to emit formaldehyde.</p> 
<p> Room air filters are not the answer to polluted air. Removing the 
pollution source is. Air filters may remove some of the toxic elements but by 
blowing the air (and dust) around vigorously the remaining toxins are made much 
more vicious in their effect. The noise of a filter motor and fumes it may put 
out itself adds misery to the simple job of breathing. Using a nonfiberglass 
filter at the furnace is a better idea.</p> 
<p> Make sure all fragrances are removed from the air, even though family 
members &quot;like&quot; them. They don't belong in air. The lungs treat them 
like toxins to be coughed up or removed by the kidneys and immune system. This 
includes colognes, scented tissues, soap and shampoo and shaving supplies. If 
you can walk into the bathroom blindfolded and know you're in the bathroom, 
it's not clean enough. Everything in the bathroom pollutes the air of the whole 
house. People who must use fragrance should apply it outdoors to keep the 
indoor air less poluted.</p> 
<h3> Anemia </h3> 
<p> Oxygen gets to the brain on a carrier system of tiny rafts called red 
blood cells. They were meant to be an exact shape and size to fit the most 
oxygen molecules onto them.</p> 
<pre> Figure 36. Red blood cells, top and side view. </pre> 
<p> Each red blood cell is shaped like a doughnut without the hole. This fits 
a lot more oxygen, O2, than round balls would. Yet, if there isn't enough 
vitamin B12, the dimple isn't put into them to make them doughnut shaped. This 
reduces the body's oxygen supply and the disorder is called 'pernicious&quot; 
anemia. The changed shape of the red blood cells is reflected in a bigger 
volume called mean cell volume (MCV). The correct volume for red blood cells is 
about 90 cubic microns. Many elderly persons have a MCV over 100!</p> 
<p> I have seen pernicious anemia to be associated with Ascaris infestation. 
Kill Ascaris on a frequency generator (408 KHz) or zap. The source of Ascaris 
is usually a pet, owned in the past. Once infected, the tiny worms do not leave 
your body on their own. The infestation may date back to childhood. What a 
relief for the bone marrow whose job it is to make red blood cells to have 
enough vitamin B12 again! What does Ascaris do with your B12? B12 is a 
beautiful rose colored vitamin. Some worms are actually pink from absorbing 
your B12! Giving B12 shots is the current clinical treatment for B12 
deficiency. Killing Ascaris twice a week by zapping and taking B12 lozenges 
(see the Sources chapter) is a better solution. (If your loved one is getting 
shots, make sure that no isopropyl alcohol is used on the skin beforehand. 
Provide vodka yourself in a small pocket flask or 70% grain alcohol for this 
purpose. Unfortunately, the shot itself may contain traces of this harmful 
solvent-take a sample home for testing.)</p> 
<p> Other kinds of&quot;anemia&quot; can deprive your elderly person of 
oxygen. A low red blood cell count (under 4.4 million/mm3) is the 
&quot;garden&quot; variety. Sometimes iron levels are low and can explain the 
low red blood cell count. Sometimes they are not.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Most regular anemias, 
including low iron levels, +++are associated with hookworm infestations. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Kill all Ancylostomas along with Ascaris twice a week. It is not wise to 
take iron pills, even if they do raise hemoglobin levels, except in 
life-threatening situations. Remove the tiny creatures that cause microscopic 
bleeding instead. Iron in the form of pills is too easily snatched up by 
bacteria who also need it, making them more virulent to the body. Use grain 
alcohol rinse in the bathroom to kill Ascaris and hookworm eggs under 
fingernails. Don't have pets in the house or keep them on daily parasite 
killing herbs.</p> 
<p> It takes nutritious food to build the blood back up to its normal 
hemoglobin level. Eggs and meats (all very well cooked) are the richest sources 
of iron and other minerals used in blood building. B6 and other vitamins are 
also involved and can be given as a B-complex (see the Sources chapter). Do not 
use black strap molasses as an iron source, or any molasses, since it contains 
toxic molds. (The molds could be detoxified with vitamin C the same way as 
honey. However, I have not tested enough molasses for solvents and you cannot 
risk these.) In the past, when the nutrient properties of molasses were 
discovered, the molasses manufacturing was a small, carefully conducted 
business. Now it has molds which cause platelet destruction, (purpuric spots) 
internal bleeding, and immune failure.</p> 
<h3> Acid Levels </h3> 
<p> Oxygen must first jump onto its raft, the hemoglobin, in the lungs. Later, 
in the brain, oxygen must jump off again to enter the brain cells. A difference 
in acid levels makes this possible. Acid levels operate the latching system 
that decides whether oxygen will be attached to hemoglobin or let go! Acidity 
unlatches oxygen. There should be no acidity in the lungs so oxygen can attach 
here. Sometimes, the entire body is too acid! Diabetics, asthmatics, 
arthritics, especially, suffer from total body acidity.</p> 
<p> Acid was meant to be removed from the blood and loaded into the stomach at 
mealtime for digestion. When this isn't happening, it was meant to be shipped 
out of the body with the urine. But the kidneys may be doing a poor job because 
they are clogged with tiny crystals and because not enough water is drunk, so 
the body's acid levels rise. You can test total body acidity by measuring the 
pH of the morning urine. It should not be under (more acid than) 5.5. If the 
body acid level is too high, help the kidneys excrete it by adding more water 
to the diet and more minerals to neutralize the acid. The main minerals for 
this purpose are calcium and magnesium.</p> 
<h3> Increase Minerals </h3> 
<p> Adding water to the diet could be the most difficult of tasks if your 
elderly loved one &quot;doesn't like it&quot;. Calcium should be in the form of 
milk, magnesium as a tablet. When tablets cannot be swallowed; use magnesium 
oxide powder (see the Sources chapter). Use 1/8 tsp. added to cooked cereal, 
soup, stew, pudding. Magnesium, being a mineral, does not get destroyed as 
vitamins may. You can add it anywhere in the diet where it won't be tasted. 
Notice how calming it is to have extra magnesium in this gradual way. And how 
much better the sleep is at night.</p> 
<p> When water &quot;doesn't taste good,&quot; there is probably a valid 
reason. The body may be trying to reject chlorine or other toxins in it. In 
this case, filter it with a small all-carbon unit that is changed right on 
schedule. A plastic pitcher (not clear plastic or flexible plastic) with a 
carbon pack fitted into the top is best. Sterilize it once a week by putting a 
cup of water and one tbs. of grain alcohol in it and turning it up side down so 
the filter can soak for 15 minutes. Flush out the alcohol with two pitchers of 
water. Make sure the temperature suits the person. Temperature can mean 
everything to the never-thirsty person. Don't allow ice cubes, however, nor 
beverage making, with the essential water. Adding lemon or vinegar (white 
distilled) and 1 tsp. honey is probably the best way to stimulate both thirst 
and appetite.</p> 
<pre> Figure 37. Water pitcher with filter. </pre> 
<p> When blood is properly oxygenated it takes on a bright red color, 
unoxygenated blood is more purple. A chelation doctor can easily see the state 
of oxygenation.</p> 
<h3> Chelation </h3> 
<p> Chelation is a powerful way to quickly improve oxygenation of blood. The 
most important rule to observe, though, is to take the treatment slowly. 
Especially if ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA) is being used to remove 
heavy metals, it is important to take the treatment over a two hour time 
period. Mini doses may be given in a shorter time. Generally, you are in charge 
of the flow rate. Discuss it with the nurse. Weekly chelations can correct many 
problems of the elderly that no other treatment could.</p> 
<p> Because of hostility from insurance companies who do not wish to add 
another cost to their ledger and doctors indoctrinated with misinformation, bad 
publicity is given to this wonderful, life-prolonging mode of treatment. 
Clinical doctors who have no time to really investigate the statistics of 
chelation treatments and for whom this is purely competition may feel 
antagonistic to these treatments. Your loved one should not be the one who must 
suffer from medical politics. Go to see for yourself what chelation is all 
about. The receptionist should be glad to show you around. The secret is to 
talk to the patients themselves. They are usually sitting around a room, eating 
their lunch and reading as their IV's drip. The pulse, blood pressure and blood 
chemistry is also carefully monitored. Sit down with them to find out their 
stories. Get a realistic picture of benefits and costs.</p> 
<h3> Pulse </h3> 
<p> The pulse reflects the heartbeat. A slow pulse can give weird brain 
symptoms besides great fatigue. The cause is usually a drug that is being taken 
to correct a fast pulse! Check with the nurse. Read the insert included with 
packaging for all drugs used. The drugs responsible are usually &quot;beta 
blockers&quot;, used for the purpose of smoothing out the heart beat, that is, 
making it regular. Often the drug can be changed.</p> 
<p> Less than 60 beats per minute will lead to trouble. For a young person it 
is a good sign to be as low as 60, provided no drug is involved. But for the 
elderly it does not reflect a strong athletic heart beat.</p> 
<p> The heart is made of four separate &quot;chambers&quot; or compartments 
each pulsing in turn. They are like four horses pulling a wagon. Unless they 
pull evenly, the wagon feels jerky, and irregular. The wagon will wear out 
sooner with jerky pulling. To smooth them out you simply slow them down. 
Apparently they sense each other better and can pull evenly now.</p> 
<p> A heart that is beating 100 times per minute, not unusual for a weak old 
heart, can be so irregular that it misses every fourth beat. That creates a 
terrible deficiency of oxygen. Imagine your four cylinder car or lawnmower 
missing one out of four engine strokes! Beta-blockers have some quite 
undesirable side effects but heart regularity has a higher priority. So drugs 
are the immediate choice. Later, when heart health is improved, the heart will 
beat regularly without drug use. In the meantime, watch over the pulse. When 
the pulse drops below 60 the new danger is slowness. Take the pulse daily when 
a new drug has been added, or when you are working on heart health, without 
getting your loved one anxious about it.</p> 
<h3> Heart Health </h3> 
<p> To improve heart health, the first steps of course would be to go off 
caffeine and to kill parasites and bacteria. This alone could drop the pulse 
from 120 to 80 in a few days. Obviously, the need for a drug is gone. Cut the 
drug dosage in half immediately. Don't wait for a doctor's appointment to O.K. 
it. If you waited another day the pulse could be below 60.</p> 
<p> Many common bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus, choose the heart 
as their favorite location. Their nesting place, though, will be under a 
missing tooth in the jaw (cavitation). Heartworm and Loa loa are two very 
common heart parasites. You can have all these killed in a day, without side 
effects and your heart is once more free to beat regularly. Don't take a chance 
on over-medicating. As soon as the beat is regular and under 100 per minute, 
reduce your heart drugs. Stop them when you are regular and under 80. Fatigue 
will leave and the brain will work better.</p> 
<p> Raising potassium levels slows the pulse. Try to do this with diet by 
eating more potassium rich food and by conserving on potassium losses. The 
adrenals are in control of losses. Give them a thorough cleaning. The adrenals 
are situated right on top of the kidneys where all toxic things are being 
excreted. Being this near to the urinary tract will result in shared toxins. 
Urinary tract bacteria, small kidney stones, moldy foods and metal from 
dentalware are the chief offenders. Switch to composite tooth fillings. Use 
non-metal jewelry. Cook and eat with non-metal ware. Don't handle metal 
unconsciously throughout the day. Aluminum objects that must be touched should 
be wrapped in masking tape: this includes walker, shower door, bathroom 
supports.</p> 
<p> Door knobs, taped walker handles, and cane handles should be wiped daily 
with a grain alcohol solution.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Treat the adrenal glands to 5 
supplements. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Vitamin C: shake some into all foods that can absorb a bit of the sour 
taste, even cooked cereal and vinegar water.</li> 
<li>Pantothenic acid: 500 mg., one daily. </li> 
<li>B6: 250-500 mg. daily. </li> 
<li>Folic acid: 800 mcg. daily. </li> 
<li>B2: 150 mg. daily. </li> </ol> 
<p> These are minimum dosages. </p> 
<p> If no capsules or tablets can be swallowed put a three day supply in a 
heavy plastic bag. Pound with a hammer; then roll finer with a big glass jar. 
Use about 1/3 of the mix each day. If you are trying to do all this in a 
nursing home, feed it to your loved one while visiting. Put the powder mix in a 
plastic (not styrofoam) cup, add honey and stir until you get a paste. Feed the 
paste directly by spoon. Often the elderly prefer it this way in order not to 
bother with pill taking at meal time. Remind them it will turn the urine yellow.
</p> 
<p> When the brain problems are corrected for an elderly person, be sure to 
relate the improvement to him or her. Improvements should not be dismissed 
lightly. Keep notes. This encourages the elderly, letting them know their 
existence and quality of life is important to you. Improvements are not merely 
steps to yet further improvements. Enjoy each bit of progress; it is often too 
subtle for your loved one to notice even when it is glaringly obvious to you. 
Before and after a chelation treatment can show a dramatic change in mood, 
energy, appetite and communication ability, yet get no comment from your loved 
one. Point it out explicitly so your loved one can look forward to it, too.</p> 
<p> Aging is no fun. The elderly long for a brisk gait, laughter, and a picnic 
at a park again. They dwell on dying, though, because they know it isn't far 
away and wonder what to do about it. They dare not talk about it because it is 
too painful a subject for the loved ones. And the immediate problems are too 
pressing to allow much contemplation of future problems. Talk about aging in 
its positive aspects. Let your loved one express feelings about it.</p> 
<h2> Incontinence </h2> 
<p> Incontinence plagues most elderly persons. It begins to plague women much 
earlier-after childbirth, for instance. Surgically shortening the bands that 
hold the bladder in position (called bladder &quot;lifting&quot;) can give 
temporary relief, but the surgeon may be the first to tell you that it is a 
temporary fix. Still, it is so shocking not to be able to run a few steps or 
sneeze or cough without wetting the underwear, that anything seems better than 
doing nothing. Surgeons will tell you that the bands have been 
&quot;overstretched&quot;.</p> 
<p> The real reason why nothing, not even surgery, is permanent is that the 
support bands are weak. Bacterial invasion causes most of this weakness. Low 
potassium levels (due to excess potassium losses by the adrenals) causes more 
weakness. When you kill bacteria (and Schistosomes and Ascaris and other 
parasites that bring in bacteria) and blood potassium levels go up, the problem 
is solved. Overnight you may throw those pads away. Even though you needed 
three pads to be &quot;safe&quot; you will not need any. Whether you have 
killed bacteria permanently determines whether you have permanently cured the 
condition. Make sure all dairy foods are absolutely sterile. Ask that the milk 
be boiled for ten seconds and other foods that can't be sterilized are not on 
the menu, like sour cream. Sour cream has too much tyramine to be safe. 
Tyramine is a bacterial by product that is quite toxic; it is rather high in 
aged cheese, also. With the food bacteria, Salmonellas and Shigella, out of the 
way and parasites being killed regularly, you can focus attention on the 
adrenals which control potassium levels.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Be careful not to rave about 
the foods that your loved one cannot eat. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b>
</pre> 
<p> Eating more potassium in food is a good nutrition project. Bananas are the 
top choice. Fresh fruit salad and baked potatoes and soup also provides a lot. 
Mixing potassium salt with regular salt, half and half, for the shaker is 
another easy trick, even if you only use it in cooking where the taste cannot 
be detected. Potassium by prescription is often used by clinicians to conserve 
body potassium during diuretic use. This need not be stopped (if the pills are 
not polluted) although taking potassium pills is less useful than salting it in 
because the adrenals will let any big dose escape anyway. A sign of too much 
potassium is a slow pulse.</p> 
<p> It may be necessary to wear some kind of incontinence underwear. Try to 
avoid them at night, though, so the skin can breathe freely. Bring a commode 
near the bed for the night, rather than diapering your loved one (but don't 
call them diapers; say &quot;underwear&quot;). Absorbent pants of all kinds are 
heavily chemicalized. This is absorbed by the skin and adds to the toxin level. 
Less will be absorbed if you powder the skin with cornstarch first. Use them 
minimally and line them with tissue or paper towel. Chair and bed pads, too, 
are chemicalized. Don't sit on them with bare skin. To facilitate getting to 
the commode quickly in the night, dress the elderly in a short night shirt, no 
pajamas or long gown. Bed socks on the feet help with warmth.</p> 
<p> Wash the body parts daily, around the urinary and rectal outlet, using 
borax water. Follow with 5% grain alcohol. Put washcloth in laundry after a 
single use. Nothing, not even brain improvement, impresses and encourages an 
elderly person as much as seeing the incontinence lessen. This bit of progress 
will put him or her solidly on your side. When they believe in you, it makes 
your task more rewarding. Remember to enjoy and celebrate your achievements 
together; don't make a grim business out of it.</p> 
<h2> Bad Digestion </h2> 
<p> Bad Digestion with its excessive gas and burping is another plague of the 
elderly. They would rather not go to church nor visit a friend than embarrass 
themselves in that way.</p> 
<h3> Chewing </h3> 
<p> It all begins with the stomach although chewing food well is essential for 
really good digestion. Dentures should fit perfectly so the mouth does not 
develop sores. Using denture cream is not a good substitute for correct fit and 
is toxic. Denture plastic is often toxic, even containing mercury in its 
composition! Toxins in plastic can seep! Such toxins lower the immunity of the 
mouth and throat and stomach since it all flows down into the stomach. Low 
immunity in the mouth permits throat infections to be chronic. If your elderly 
loved one has a red-looking mouth or throat, instead of pink, an infection is 
going on in spite of no coughs and no complaints.</p> 
<p> It will do no good to keep zapping bacteria when reinfection is so easy. 
First kill the bacteria in the dentures by soaking in 70% grain alcohol. Then 
test the dentures for toxins. Soak the dentures in water for several hours. 
Rinse and soak again in fresh water. Repeat a third time to insure that any 
toxin found came from the dentures, not the saliva. Save this water for 
testing. Search for heavy metals in the denture water. If you find any, you 
know the dentures are toxic! Get new ones, made of uncolored methacrylate (see 
Dental Cleanup, page 409).</p> 
<p> The denture-soak should kill bacteria each night. Plastic has tiny pores 
where bacteria can hide. Use 70% grain alcohol which you make yourself or plain 
vodka which is about 50% alcohol. Since alcohol evaporates and is expensive, 
use a wide mouth jar with close fitting non-metal lid for all this. Fish them 
out with your toothbrush so it gets sterilized too. It only takes minutes to 
kill everything. Commercial denture cleaners are much more toxic than grain 
alcohol; don't use them.</p> 
<p> Use food grade hydrogen peroxide or salt water to brush teeth in your 
mouth, never toothpaste. Toothpaste has toxic metals (tin, fluoride, strontium) 
besides benzene pollution. See the section on brushing teeth (page 532) for 
details and sources. If you are responsible for this daily chore, use homemade 
floss (2 pound to 4 pound nylon fish line) first; then brush. If your loved one 
is seated they may be able to handle the brush by themselves, giving them pride 
in the achievement.</p> 
<p> If an elderly person refuses or can't wear dentures, provide food that is 
soft and without chunks since this decides whether the stomach can digest it. 
The stomach is the weak point of the digestive process for the elderly because 
nearly all don't produce enough acid to get the job done.</p> 
<h3> Stomach Acid </h3> 
<p> The body produces hydrochloric acid (HCL) which gets pushed into the 
stomach from the blood! The enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, a zinc enzyme, is 
involved. Not many ways are known to stimulate this whole process. Drinking 
water before meals stimulates it in unknown ways but is hard to do for the 
elderly. Next best is to provide acid.</p> 
<p> Because strong HCL would dissolve teeth it is not available as a solution 
to aid digestion. Ask a pharmacist to make a 1% HCL solution and use 10 drops 
of it in a beverage at mealtime once a day. HCL as a tablet (&quot;Betaine 
HCL&quot;) is available but doesn't have enough HCL in it.</p> 
<p> Using a lemon or vinegar and honey beverage helps with digestion although 
this provides citric or acetic acid, not hydrochloric. These acids are 
completely metabolized so they don't add to the body acid level. But the fact 
that it is not hydrochloric means that it can't kill bacteria and parasites in 
the stomach like regular hydrochloric acid could. The stomach becomes a haven 
for Salmonellas and other bacteria and this is the biggest digestive plague of 
the elderly. Salmonellas dig deep into the stomach wall, safe from antibiotics 
and stomach acid and aren't washed away with the food. When they take over the 
region near the top of the stomach, it weakens the esophageal sphincter and 
food keeps coming back up a bit - a most uncomfortable development, especially 
after supper or when lying down.</p> 
<p> When the Salmonellas spread out further to invade the diaphragm around the 
sphincter, the diaphragm weakens, and lets a bit of the stomach up through the 
hole.</p> 
<p> This causes hiatal hernia distress. Don't settle your loved one in an easy 
chair after supper. This presses the stomach upward and the food up, too. Leave 
them sitting at the table a while, then walk a bit, to get the food down lower. 
The food will sink lower if some of it can leave the stomach at the lower 
pyloric end. But if Salmonellas are entrenched here, too, the lower end does 
not have enough action to push the food through the valve. Drugs like 
Reglan(TM) are given to speed this up.</p> 
<p> What helps most is getting digestion completed. This sets up the natural 
cues for emptying. Digestive enzyme tablets have been in popular use to help 
digestion. But they may not be safe since they have not been sterilized. Always 
try the vinegar and honey method first. Coughing during eating is a sign that 
the diaphragm is irritated (by a hiatal hernia). If drinking water starts the 
coughing, omit it at the beginning of meals. Work in sips during the meal.</p> 
<h3> Salmonella and Shigella </h3> 
<p> Some Salmonella infections can bring diziness to your elderly person. 
Dizziness is another plague of the elderly, keeping them from going shopping, 
getting to church and even from getting around their own homes. Drugs such as 
Antivert(TM) are given but only take the edge off the problem. Feeling dizzy 
can make your loved one home bound and stuck to a walker for every move.</p> 
<p> Salmonellas, along with Shigellas, produce very toxic substances that 
cause dizziness. There are three common Salmonella varieties: Salmonella 
enteriditis, Salmonella paratyphi, and Salmonella typhimurium (386, 380, 354 
KHz). Kill Salmonellas daily for a month by taking Lugol's iodine (6 drops in a 
half cup water, after meals and bedtime, see Recipes). Unfortunately, this will 
not kill Shigellas; follow the Bowel Program (page 546) to get them.</p> 
<p> During this time set up a system of sterilizing all dairy products (see 
Milk, page 425) since this is the source of reinfection. Set up a system of 
rinsing fingers (and fingernails) in 10% grain alcohol in the bathroom. Deli 
food and restaurant salads carry Salmonellas and Shigellas, too. Kill them, 
routinely, after eating such food due to necessity. A warm stomach full of food 
at a neutral pH is just the right culture condition for these bacteria. It's 
like putting yeast into a bowl of warm water, flour and sugar. In half an hour 
it is overflowing with growth.</p> 
<p> Once Salmonella is entrenched in an organ it is difficult to eliminate. 
Only an electric zapper can kill them all (in an organ, not the bowel). If your 
body has the right conditions (like a low acid stomach) to let them grow you 
dare not swallow another one! Shigellas arrive with dairy foods, too, but 
prefer the lower intestine as their headquarters. Indigestion that starts right 
after eating is probably due to Salmonellas. If your indigestion comes in the 
night, this suggests Shigellas, since they've had time to reach their favorite 
place further down.</p> 
<p> Campylobacter and E. coli, other digestive bacteria, are sometimes the 
culprits. The Bowel Program is effective against these also. Besides getting 
digestive improvement you get mental improvement, less depression, less 
dizziness, less irritability after clearing these up. Remember that eating 
bacteria and killing them later will not solve the problem. Stopping eating 
them will.</p> 
<h3> Other Clues </h3> 
<p> Digestion problems that remain after eliminating bacteria can be diagnosed 
in a rational way. Ask these questions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Is the stool orangish-yellow, or very pale, instead of greenish brown? If 
so, bile isn't getting delivered to the small intestine from the liver.</li> 
<li>Is there abdominal pain? (More about this on page 97). It may be due to 
Ascaris, flukes, or other parasites.</li> 
<li>Is there constipation? This will let wastes accumulate, all the longer for 
bacteria to thrive on them.</li> 
<li>Is there bloating? This is due to gas made by bacteria. </li> 
<li>Does the stool float? If so, it must be lighter than water and contain fat 
or a great deal of undigested material.</li> </ul> 
<h3> Liver Bile </h3> 
<p> Bile is necessary for digestion. Absorption of fat and calcium depends on 
bile mixing with the food. When fat isn't absorbed, it stays in the intestine. 
Fat is lighter than water; it makes the stool float. Feces should not float. 
When the stool floats you can assume that calcium isn't being absorbed either, 
leaving the blood in a deficit which will be taken from the bones.</p> 
<p> If the stool floats or is orangish in color prepare your elderly person 
for a liver cleanse (page 552) to clear a bile duct of obstruction. They get 
quite fond of these cleanses and will ask to have one. Liver cleanses are 
completely safe, even for persons in their 80's. One of the stones pictured on 
page 554 came from a woman age 97. The general rules apply to the extremely 
elderly: kill all parasites first by zapper if possible, otherwise by herbal 
parasite killing. Do a kidney cleanse (page 549) first, using half a dose 
instead of the regular dose, for three to six weeks. Attend your loved one in 
person for the liver cleanse, have a commode at bedside, protect bedding from 
accident: use paper underwear if necessary. Share the joy of getting gallstones 
out painlessly with your loved one; let them see and count them if they wish 
before you flush them (use a flashlight).</p> 
<p> Be extra careful with the skin cleansing. Hot water soothes and heals. Use 
starch skin soother to dispense onto the wet paper towel, besides borax 
solution and alcohol. Don't use ordinary soap. The starch skin softener gives 
the smoothness of soap, and prevents the pain of friction. An elderly person 
may have no diarrhea at all with the Epsom salts! Evidently the body absorbs 
all the magnesium so eagerly, none is left in the intestine to absorb water and 
create diarrhea. It is especially important though to rehydrate your elderly 
person after a diarrhea. This time they do not balk at water consumption. The 
liver cleanse, it seems, gives them new thirst as well as new appetite. But it 
doesn't last long. As the stones from the far corners of the liver move 
forward, they compact into larger stones and plug the ducts again. Their 
previous symptoms return. Try to give a cleanse once a month until the dark 
color of the stool returns and it no longer floats.</p> 
<p> The benefits of a liver cleanse will last longer if valerian herb is taken 
the day after the cleanse and from then forward. It may be preventing spasm of 
the bile ducts. Use 2 oz. of the herb (cut) in 3 cups water. Simmer for 5-10 
minutes, let settle or strain. Add honey to sweeten. Give a few tbs. every 4 
hours (or 6 capsules) for several days followed by a daily dose at bedtime.</p> 
<h3> Constipation </h3> 
<p> If constipation is a problem, use an herbal product rather than a drug 
until you have removed the cause. Cascara sagrada (half dosage) or prunes work 
for many people. Adding roughage to the diet is a good solution but often 
doesn't work. If you try bran, you should add vitamin C and boil it, first, 
because it is very moldy. But even eating tree branches for supper won't move a 
bowel that has the wrong bacteria in it.</p> 
<p> Bacteria are part of the cause, and part of the result! Constipation 
increases the bacteria level which causes further constipation! You may solve 
the constipation problem immediately by zapping. Even though this kills some 
&quot;good&quot; with some &quot;bad&quot; bacteria, no harm is done. The stool 
is recolonized in one to two days.</p> 
<h3> Poop Your Troubles Away </h3> 
<p> Two bowel movements a day are the minimum necessary for good health. The 
first one should be in the morning. The morning cup of water, drunk at the 
bedside has the magical ability to move the bowels. Cold water may fail. But 
the water effect only works in the early morning. Waiting until after breakfast 
may not work. Notice the energy lift your loved one gets from this most 
primitive body cleanse. Take advantage of this to exercise them. Go immediately 
for the morning walk. This might be the only time of day they can enjoy their 
walk.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Walking and liver cleansing 
are the most health-promoting +++activities you can do for your loved one. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Make walking as essential as eating. Walking is not merely walking about 
the house or shopping. Walking should be done outdoors. Walking is a brisk 
exercise, done as speedily as possible and lasting at least 1/2 hour. Only if 
the weather doesn't allow outdoor walking can an indoor walk be substituted. 
Don't let your elderly person choose whether they will walk that day. To 
overcome resistance, find a cheerful neighborhood person willing to do this 
task for pay. The need to respond to a new stranger energizes the elderly more 
than your persuasion can.</p> 
<h3> Sugar Regulation </h3> 
<p> Diabetes is a common development in the elderly. If your loved one is 
already on a pill for beginning diabetes, take this as your challenge never to 
let it get worse. It is not a chronic metabolic deterioration. It is a 
destruction of the pancreas (specifically the islets) by the pancreatic fluke 
which is attracted to the pancreas by wood alcohol. Zap flukes and eliminate 
wood alcohol as described in the section on diabetes (page 173).</p> 
<p> Use no artificial sweetener and no beverages besides milk, water and the 
recipes given in this book. This is one regimen your loved one will not resent. 
They are well motivated to prevent the need for giving themselves daily shots 
of insulin. Use this motivation to acquire the taste for new foods and 
beverages.</p> 
<h2> Elderly Person's 7 Day Diabetic Diet </h2> 
<p> Daily supplements: 4 chromium (200 mcg. each), 1 or 2 B50 complex, vitamin 
C (1,000 mg. or 1/4 tsp.). Take with food.</p> 
<h3> Breakfast </h3> 
<p> Choose any one; they need not be in order. </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Two eggs, (replace carton and wash hands and eggs before cracking), 
wheat-free, corn-free bread, not toasted (special breads can be found in the 
freezer section of natural food stores), with butter and 1 tbs. orange blossom 
honey. 1 peeled pear, raw, with whipping cream. One cup hot milk with cinnamon.
</li> 
<li>Old fashioned oats, with 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. vitamin C, stirred 
in just before serving. Mix whipping cream with sterilized milk to make a 
&quot;half n half&quot; for the cereal. 1 tbs. honey. 1 banana. One half cup 
milk, one half glass water with honey and vinegar.</li> 
<li>Fried potatoes with 2 eggs (use only butter, olive oil or lard), 1 cup hot 
or cold milk. A quartered orange (wash the orange before quartering).</li> 
<li>Cream of rice, with homemade &quot;half n half&quot; or whipping cream, 
cinnamon and vitamin C stirred in. 1 cup milk, 1 banana.</li> 
<li>Cottage cheese, cooked in covered skillet to sterilize. Add chives or 
peeled fruit (not canned). Wheat-free, corn-free bread, or rice bread with 1 
tbs. honey. 1 nectarine or piece of melon. 1 cup hot milk. Water with vinegar 
and honey.</li> 
<li>Pancakes or waffles with butter and eggs (no sweetening). Fruit (peeled), 
hot milk, water.</li> 
<li>Fruit cup, large bowl of peeled, chopped mixed fruit with whipping cream 
and 1 tbs. honey and rice bread or other wheat-free, corn-free bread with 
unsalted butter. 1 cup hot milk with cinnamon.</li> </ol> 
<p> Remember, all honey must be pretreated with vitamin C. All fruit is peeled 
and free of blemishes and soft spots. All milk, cream, butter must be 
sterilized for 10 seconds at full boiling point. Butter must not be 
&quot;raw&quot;. Get wheat-free, corn-free bread at a natural foods store.</p> 
<h3> Lunch </h3> 
<p> It is better to have most of the day's calories in the middle of the day 
than at the end. Arrange for dinner at noon if possible.</p> 
<h3> Dinner </h3> 
<p> Choose any one. </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Green beans with potatoes, meat dish, cabbage apple salad, water with 
lemon juice and honey, 1 cup hot milk. Water.
<p> Fresh green beans, especially fava beans contain a substance that is 
described in old herbal literature to be especially beneficial to diabetics. 
Don't overcook them - it might harm this substance.</p> 
<p> For the same reason, don't use canned green beans. If &quot;fresh&quot; 
isn't possible, choose &quot;frozen&quot; but rinse the chemicals off before 
cooking. Potatoes (not overcooked), peeled to make sure there are no blemishes 
(contain mold and pesticide) can be cooked with the beans. Cook with onions and 
oregano for flavoring. Add fresh chopped parsley to the sauce or butter for 
both green beans and potatoes. Fresh parsley has special herbal goodness (high 
magnesium, high potassium, diuretic.)</p> 
<p> The meat dish should be overdone. &quot;Fast food&quot; is plopped from 
the freezer into the boiling grease which browns the outside nicely but can 
easily leave the inside undercooked. Meat must never be &quot;rare&quot;. There 
should be no redness near bones! Canned meat is safe from parasites but may 
have smoke flavoring added (contains benzopy rene) or nitrates. Avoid these 
chemicals. Avoid MSG too. Whenever a meat dish is not accepted, substitute 
sardines. Let them choose from a display of six kinds. Purchase the flip-top 
cans to avoid eating metal grindings from the can opening process.</p> 
<p> Cabbage for salad should be chopped fine enough to be digestible. Add 
finely chopped apples (peeled) and a few apple seeds and whipping cream for the 
dressing.</p> 
<p> Sweet things are reserved for dessert. Since a diabetic's tissues are not 
absorbing sugar, they crave it more and more. As the diabetes improves they 
crave it less. For dessert, serve 1 tbs. of honey to satisfy this craving 
without endangering their blood sugar regulation. It can be used in the hot 
milk or in other ways. Undercooking the vegetables also helps slow down the 
sugar release. Never serve mashed potatoes for this reason.</p> 
<p> The drinking water should always have a little vitamin C, lemon juice or 
vinegar added, and 1 tsp. honey if desired.</p> </li> 
<li>Asparagus, potato, raw salad, fowl dish, fruit, water with vinegar and 
honey, 1 cup hot milk.
<p> The asparagus can be fresh or canned. Bake the potato: not in aluminum 
foil, not baked until fluffy. Don't let the skin be eaten. Use genuine butter, 
only, or a homemade sour cream dressing (see Recipes). Fresh chopped chives may 
be added but no regular sour cream since this is very high in tyramine, a brain 
toxin.</p> 
<p> The raw salad should be chopped small enough to be edible by dentures. Use 
homemade salad dressing with a preference for oil and vinegar styles.</p> 
<p> The fowl dish should be very well done, never &quot;fast food&quot;. </p> 
<p> For dessert, fresh fruit chunks dipped in a homemade honey sauce (honey, 
water and cinnamon). Less sweets are consumed if you dip the fruit rather than 
pour the sauce over. Limit the total to 1 tbs. honey. Don't serve grapes or 
strawberries due to the intense mold problem.</p> </li> 
<li>Soup, sandwich, fruit, hot milk, water. 
<p> Soup should be homemade from scratch. Add bones and 1 tbs. vinegar (white 
distilled) or a tomato to the kettle to ensure some calcium leaches out of the 
bones. A fish chowder serves this purpose very well, too.</p> 
<p> The sandwich has lettuce, real butter, and whatever else tastes good (no 
cheese, bacon bits or condiments). The bread is wheat-free, corn-free, stored 
in freezer. Home-made salad dressing can be added.</p> 
<p> The fruit may be chopped with whipping cream, cinnamon and honey sauce 
(not more than 1 tbs. honey).</p> 
<p> The water may be plain if there was vinegar in the soup. </p> </li> 
<li>Fish, green beans, potatoes, other greens, fruit, hot milk, water. 
<p> Fried or baked fish is served with lemon or lime. Green beans are served 
with a cheese sauce so a lot will be eaten. (Cheese sauce: add milk, olive oil 
to a block of cheese. Melt and cook at least 10 seconds.) Serve au gratin 
potatoes or scalloped potatoes or any kind of potatoes that will be enjoyed. 
The extra greens can be beet greens, collards, mustard greens or spinach served 
with a favorite dressing to make sure it's eaten. (No croutons or bacon bits, 
though.)</p> 
<p> Never serve dessert if the plate has not been cleared. Your loved one 
isn't hungry enough. If appetite is very poor, sweets will only worsen the 
problem. Try to change the menu to stimulate the appetite. Acid foods 
stimulate; spices and B-vitamins (especially B1) stimulate; hot foods 
stimulate. Much appetite is controlled by the liver and brain. Toxins at either 
location (especially food-derived toxins) tell the body to stop eating. Suspect 
food molds first, bacteria and chemical additives next.</p> </li> 
<li>Asparagus, meat dish, white rice (brown rice contains mold), coleslaw, 
milk, water, ice cream.
<p> A hot meat dish (no pasta, no wheat flour, no regular gravy) can be fried, 
cooked or baked, but not grilled. Asparagus is fresh, frozen or canned. Rinse 
if frozen. Fix it differently than last time. Season rice with parsley and 
minimal salt and pure herbs like thyme; no MSG or mixed seasoning, make butter 
sauce. Dessert is homemade ice cream (see the Recipes chapter).</p> </li> 
<li>Fish or seafood hot dish. Green peas or peas and onions. Peeled sweet 
potato with butter (not canned). May switch sweet potato with rice on asparagus 
day. Sliced tomatoes or cucumber or other raw vegetables with or without 
dressing. Milk, 1 tbs. honey (can be used on sweet potato).</li> 
<li>Chili or stew with unlimited rice-bread and butter. If chili produces gas, 
stay away from it. Serve no canned varieties. Grated carrot salad with stewed 
raisins added and heavy cream. Milk, water as usual. Blueberry pie, sweet 
potato pie, custard pie.</li> </ol> 
<p> If more bread is requested, provide a wheat-free, corn-free variety; but 
limit bread eating to &quot;after main dish&quot; eating. If not enough milk is 
drunk: make custard pudding or rice pudding so the daily amount (3 cups) is 
consumed.</p> 
<h3> Supper </h3> 
<p> </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Tuna with salad dressing or tuna salad (no pasta). Nonwheat raisin bread 
(from natural foods store) and butter. Milk, water.</li> 
<li>Custard, cooked greens, baked potato. Rice-bread and butter. Herb tea with 
milk added (single herb only, not mixed herbs).</li> 
<li>Vegetable soup, homemade, from scratch. Leftover meat sandwich with 
rice-bread (no deli or cold cuts or luncheon meat). Milk, water.</li> 
<li>Baked squash with butter, rice pudding with cinnamon, raisins, and honey. 
Canned salmon or sardines with wheat free, corn free bread. Milk, water.</li> 
<li>Chili or stew leftovers with wheat free, corn free bread. Custard pudding 
sweetened with honey, and nutmeg/cinnamon mix. Mild, water.</li> 
<li>Sardines and rice bread or other wheat free, corn free bread. Homemade 
tomato juice with celery, strained. Milk, plain water. Pie a la mode (homemade 
pumpkin or squash pie and homemade ice cream).</li> 
<li>Potato salad. Leftover meat dish and beans, stewed tomatoes, squash. Baked 
apple with cinnamon, cream and honey. Milk, water.</li> </ol> 
<p> Many diabetics lose 50 points (mg/DL) of blood sugar in a few days on this 
diet. This is why: there is less bread than a diabetic would prefer. There is 
very little cheese (it must always be boiled in a sauce to sterilize). There is 
no fruit or vegetable juice except homemade, and not much of that because it 
crowds out milk and water. If your elderly loved one can't eat all this, make 
sure there are no snacks consumed between meals that are forbidden.</p> 
<p> There is no pasta anywhere. Pasta is mold-ridden. Even after cooking, it 
may be toxic. There is no wheat or corn bread. The menu is heavy on green beans 
and asparagus and cinnamon. If by chance, your elderly person hates these and 
starves themselves to get your sympathy, add a lot more potatoes and rice 
(never brown) to raise calories.</p> 
<p> There is no sweetening other than honey (5 kinds). There are no syrups or 
sugars. Honey is self limiting-the taste for it is all gone after 1 tbs. Not so 
for other sugars. The heavy use of cream and butter is offset by no deep fat 
fried food and little cheese.</p> 
<p> Keep in mind that this diet may reduce the need for insulin almost 
immediately. You may have to cut it in half! But how would you know this? The 
morning blood sugar test is essential to keep track of changing circumstances. 
Don't neglect it. Be careful not to use rubbing alcohol when making the finger 
stick (use vodka or grain alcohol). Your elderly person will feel it is all 
worthwhile (doing without coffee or pie) if one less insulin shot is needed or 
if they can go back on tablets instead of insulin. Or even just the knowledge 
they are staying well controlled and will never have to take insulin shots. 
Remember to give yourself the credit for a fine accomplishment when your loved 
one's diabetes improves.</p> 
<h3> Diabetic Supplements </h3> 
<p> Several supplements are especially good for diabetics: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fenugreek seeds, 3 capsules with each meal. </li> 
<li>Fresh vegetable juice made of raw green beans and carrots (1/2 cup total). 
</li> 
<li>Bilberry leaves. Maybe they have something in them that helps detoxify 
wood alcohol, since bilberry leaves are good for eyes, too. Get in capsules or 
make a tea.</li> </ul> 
<h3> Diabetic Eating Out </h3> 
<p> Since the rules are always somewhat relaxed when &quot;eating out&quot; a 
diabetic loved one will badger you to go out with them. If rules are sure to be 
broken, calculate it into the rest of the day so you can compensate for it.</p> 
<h3> Extra Diet Tips For The Elderly </h3> 
<p> Food should taste good. </p> 
<p> Eating is a fundamental pleasure of living. In old age there is no other 
pleasure that can equal enjoyment of food. It is a time when we long for the 
foods of our own childhood, too. Ethnic foods often had to be given up when 
children were raised (switched to hot dogs and pizza) but with this diversion 
gone, a return to family food would be most welcome and most healthful. Ethnic 
foods were made from scratch. And they certainly were made at home where 
cleanliness and &quot;persnickitiness&quot; are at their finest! A speck in the 
batter gets noticed. Not so in a commercial mixing vat. Pots and pans are 
sanitized with hot water, not chemicals.</p> 
<p> Good advice is to return to old fashioned home cooking: with its flour and 
butter, lard and cream, homemade pasta, olive oil and soup, coarse cereal 
grains and plain fruit. Gone are the fruit juices, flour mixes, crackers and 
sweets that fill grocery shelves. What about convenience? Old fashioned cooking 
took most of the day. It does take 3 or 4 hours to make a soup from scratch. 
But you then get 3 days off! Each day you reboil it, it is sterile again. Or 
freeze half of it (take the potatoes out first). It does take a whole morning 
to make pasta or some ethnic dish. Freeze it in plastic sealed containers so 
the delicate flavor isn't spoiled. Baking homemade bread is automated now. Do 
at least this much to get away from the mold-ridden grocery store loaves. Make 
your own ice cream and nut butters. They last many days and free your schedule.
</p> 
<p> Time is the great inhibitor but if you have the means or the help, the 
best advice, nutritionally, is a return to old-fashioned cooking and recipes. 
Use your new insights to improve them where you can. Don't use your mother's 
aluminum ware; use her enamel ware or the new glass and ceramic ware. Don't use 
her copper-bottomed tea kettle or gold-rimmed cups or &quot;silver&quot;. Use 
her wooden spoons, glass glasses, and plain dishes, her wooden and straw bowls 
and enamel pots and pans.</p> 
<h3> Salt </h3> 
<p> Should you avoid salt? No. But a good salt rule is to either cook with it 
or have it on the table, but not both. Use aluminum-free sea salt, and make 
sure the salt is sterilized by heating five minutes at 400 degrees F in a glass 
pie plate to kill mold. (Sea gulls fly over the salt flats where sea salt is 
gathered. Their droppings provide a medium for mold.)</p> 
<pre> Figure 38. Sea salt flats are often roosting places for sea gulls. </pre>
<p> The best salt is a mixture of 1 part of your aluminum-free, sterilized sea 
salt and 1 part potassium chloride (another kind of salt, see Sources). 
Potassium ousts sodium (salt) from your body, so you can use twice as much of 
this kind of salt! Also, the extra potassium helps lift fatigue and has other 
benefits.</p> 
<p> Always use a non-metal salt shaker with a closable lid to keep out 
moisture. Don't put rice in your salt because it invites mold.</p> 
<p> Since you, the cook, know where the salt is, (mostly in soups and stews), 
don't serve as much of these when there is heart and kidney illness or high 
blood pressure. Don't put salt in cereal, cooking vegetables, or other dishes. 
Just leave it out! Use herbs instead. Tip: encapsulated herbs stay fresher and 
are more potent. Fenugreek and thyme are the most beneficial of the common 
cooking herbs. Just open a capsule and season.</p> 
<h2> Tremor </h2> 
<p> Tremor is a symptom, not a natural part of aging. The nerves controlling 
the hands and arms are poisoned. The nerves originate in the brain where the 
poison has accumulated. What is the poison? Did it happen long ago? No! It 
could have happened as long as two weeks ago but not longer!</p> 
<p> Tremor is the result of ongoing poisoning! It is important to find the 
poison as soon as you can since the rest of the body will soon be affected, 
too. Search your memory for the new things that happened in the last two weeks. 
It is a herculean task but only gets harder each day, so keep notes as you ask: 
Is there new carpeting? Is there a new furnace? Is there a different water 
supply? Is there a new hair dresser? Did somebody bring a vase of fresh 
flowers? Is there a new laundry person? Was the place sprayed for insects? Is 
there a new medicine (drug) or supplement? Was remodeling done? Is there a new 
food?</p> 
<p> The list is endless and the situation looks hopeless because so many new 
things can happen in two weeks.</p> 
<p> Rather than asking individual questions like these, let's ask only five 
general questions and have the assurance that one of them will catch the 
culprit.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Is it in the air? This will catch insecticide, flowers, carpets all 
together.</li> 
<li>Is it in the water? </li> 
<li>Is it in the medicines or supplements? </li> 
<li>Is it in the clothing? </li> 
<li>Is it in the food or on the dishes? </li> </ol> 
<p> To answer each question, test the item using your Syncrometer searching 
technique. Make a test substance. Then search a saliva sample for it.</p> 
<p> To test the air, take a dust sample off the kitchen counter or table (this 
gives you fresh dust). Pick up the dust with a few wipes by a small, two inch 
square of damp paper towel. Place in a resealable baggy.</p> 
<p> To test the water, make samples by putting about a tsp. of hot, cold, or 
filtered water into a resealable baggy with a bit of paper towel in it. Try to 
get the first morning water before it has run.</p> 
<p> To test the medicines and supplements put one of each in resealable 
baggies.</p> 
<p> To test clothing (laundry) use a bit of it, (such as a sock) rolled up 
tightly.</p> 
<p> Testing food is the biggest job. If there are leftovers in the 
refrigerator or freezer, this helps. You can combine all the leftovers in a 
single baggy. Frozen things don't need to be thawed for testing. Still, the 
chance of missing a food culprit is quite high. Be sure to test everything 
eaten in a two week time period: unusual things like popcorn, candy, crackers, 
cookies, health foods and special powders. A consolation is that you will find 
a number of bad foods that are not necessarily the tremor causes but which 
cause other health problems.</p> 
<h3> Tremor Remedies </h3> 
<p> </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Let us imagine that the air (dust) sample proves toxic (resonates with the 
saliva sample). What is it in the air that is toxic? These are the biggest 
suspects:
<ul> 
<li>CFCs (from leaking refrigerant, check refrigerator and air conditioner by 
removing them from the house and retesting the dust after three days, or simply 
buy a non-CFC variety)</li> 
<li>vanadium (from leaking house gas from a fuel-line repair) </li> 
<li>arsenic from pesticide (switch to boric acid) </li> 
<li>solvent from a lamp or can of lighter fuel (take them out of the house) 
</li> 
<li>chlorine from water (use carbon filters, remove bleach bottles) </li> 
<li>asbestos (clothes dryer belt) </li> 
<li>paint thinner, carpet cleaner (remove from house) </li> 
<li>fiberglass from bare insulation somewhere (fix holes in ceiling or wall) 
</li> 
<li>formaldehyde (new foam bedding, new fabric or clothing) </li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Suppose the water proves toxic (appears in your white blood cells); search 
for lead, copper, and cadmium. Although municipal water tests occasionally 
detect small amounts of propyl alcohol, benzene, or wood alcohol, I have never 
detected them-you need not search for them.</li> 
<li>If the medicines are toxic just change brands. Your pharmacist can help 
you find a replacement brand. Find which ones are toxic and stop using them. 
(Don't use up any of the polluted pills or supplements.) They do more harm than 
good.</li> 
<li>If the clothing or dishes are toxic (appear in the saliva), suspect: 
<ul> 
<li>cobalt </li> 
<li>PCB </li> 
<li>aluminum </li> </ul> Stop all detergent use. Use borax, or washing soda, 
or use paper plates and plastic cups (not styrofoam).</li> 
<li>If the food is toxic, suspect: 
<ul> 
<li>food molds </li> 
<li>aluminum </li> 
<li>bacteria </li> </ul> Don't eat that food any more. </li> 
<li>Any bacterium or toxin that invades certain brain centers can cause 
tremor. The most common culprits are Shigella, mercury, thallium and arsenic. 
Try to identify these for your sake as well as your loved one.</li> </ol> 
<p> The Salmonellas and Shigellas will have come from some food. Be sure all 
dairy foods, including butter and whipping cream, are sterilized. Parasites 
come from meats. Be sure no undercooked or fast food meats are eaten. Kill all 
bacteria, viruses and parasites with a zapper. Sterilize fingernails with grain 
alcohol to prevent reinfection. Use Lugol's (see Recipes) and the Bowel Program 
(page 546) to clear them up.</p> 
<p> Bacteria, coming from teeth and jaw (bone infections, called cavitations) 
may not seem as recent as two weeks. Indeed, they may have been there for ten 
years. But something recent may have aggravated them, so they now can enter 
more easily into the blood and brain. You may never find out what caused this. 
It is wisest to check this possibility with a dentist before doing weeks of 
other testing. See a dentist who can find and clean cavitations. Do dental 
repair according to the principles described in the dental section.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Going after a tremor problem 
in this logical way +++always finds the cause of tremor, whether its a simple 
+++short attack or a situation of long standing tremor +++with head shaking and 
drooling. If your situation is +++extra difficult, you will at least improve it 
and stop +++its progression. This includes Parkinson's cases. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> In cases of Parkinson's disease I often find the bacterium Clostridium 
tetani, well known for causing stiffness. It hides under tooth fillings, too.
</p> 
<p> Remember, there is a consolation for doing all this work. When you find 
the culprit, you not only will be stopping the tremor, you will be improving a 
lot of other conditions along the way. Conditions like hesitant speech, 
shuffling walk, getting up stiffly and slowly from a chair. These are extra 
dividends for your loved one. And you have learned which things to avoid for 
yourself too.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++One more thing, don't take no 
for an answer ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> If the problem is a drug, don't accept &quot;No, it can't be 
changed&quot;. Everything can be changed. Go to higher levels of authority. 
Doctors are very understanding and sympathetic with your intent. If the problem 
is leaking house gas, don't accept &quot;We can't find a leak,&quot; implying 
there is none. Go to a building contractor or the Health Department. Their 
equipment is better. If you get nowhere, change to electric utilities. If the 
problem is auto exhaust, don't accept &quot;But we have to use the kitchen door 
to the garage, because it's cold outside&quot;. Conveniences vs. tremor is no 
contest. Everyone benefits by excluding auto fumes from the house. Lock the 
door and cover it with plastic. By the time you have identified the culprits 
(probably 20 hours of work) surely you have won the right to make changes.</p> 
<p> Often others are not impressed. Even when the tremor lessens and the 
elderly person plainly states they feel better, family members may disregard 
your recommendations. Get tough! It's your loved one. You have something at 
stake too. Be sympathetic with negative responses. But very firm. Make their 
choices clear:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Either the inside door to the garage gets sealed off or the cars and lawn 
mower get parked outside and anything containing gasoline or solvents gets put 
in a detached shed.</li> 
<li>Either the girls use their hair dryers in their bedrooms with the door 
closed or you'll get them all new ones that don't contain asbestos.</li> 
<li>Either the clothes dryer gets a new belt or it is taped securely shut and 
the laundry is dried on the line or taken to a Laundromat.</li> 
<li>Either the plumbing gets changed (to plastic) or each faucet in the house 
gets a filter. (If your plumbing is corroding, not even filters are a good 
idea-you would have to change them every week!)</li> </ul> 
<h2> Weakness </h2> 
<p> Weakness should not be taken for granted in the elderly. Especially if 
they themselves complain about it. It isn't normal for them. Sometimes they 
will describe &quot;spells&quot; of weakness. This is an important clue. Check 
the pulse immediately. Count for 30 beats at least. Are there missing beats? 
There should not be! Missing two beats in a row certainly can produce a weak or 
&quot;sinking&quot; spell. The brain and body need every pulse of blood sent 
out right on time.</p> 
<p> Check into caffeine use first. Take it all away. Caffeine speeds up the 
heart, then the overworked heart has to &quot;take time out&quot; for itself by 
missing a beat. Don't switch to decafs because this introduces solvents and new 
problems. If no other natural beverages appeal, serve hot water with cream and 
cinnamon. After stopping caffeine use ask: Is the pulse too slow or too fast? 
The pulse should be between 60 and 80 beats per minute.</p> 
<p> If it is lower than 60, a medicine may be at fault. Ask the clinical 
doctor about it immediately. A slow pulse could certainly bring about weakness. 
A young athlete may have a slow pulse legitimately, due to having a very strong 
efficient heart, but your elderly person does not fit this category. The cause 
must be found.</p> 
<p> If the pulse is quite high, over 100 perhaps, this will wear the heart out 
much sooner than necessary. Ask why it is beating so fast? A probable answer is 
that it is so weak that it has to beat faster to keep up with its job of 
circulating the blood. What is making the heart so weak?</p> 
<h2> Heart Disease </h2> 
<p> When the heart is enlarged, the valves don't quite close where they 
should, making the work harder for it and weakening it. It may be called 
&quot;congestive heart failure&quot;. Why is it enlarged? Possibly because it 
is so weak! Yes, it becomes a vicious cycle, getting worse and worse. But you 
can break into this cycle and get it all reversed again. The real culprit is 
parasite invaders and toxic pollutants.</p> 
<p> The most common parasite heart invaders are Dirofilaria, heartworm 
&quot;of dogs&quot; and Loa loa, another small filaria worm. At one stage these 
worms are so tiny that they can slide through the smallest blood vessels. They 
are very contagious. Even persons who don't live with a house dog can pick up 
heartworm. Loa loa is thought to be a tropical parasite but it is alive and 
thriving in the USA! The source of Loa loa seems to be tapeworm stages; this is 
not a certainty.</p> 
<p> Both heartworm and Loa loa are very easy to kill with a zapper and both 
are very easy to pick up again. Treat your elderly person twice a week if there 
is anY heart problem. It makes no difference that the house dog is getting 
monthly preventive treatments for heartworm. They pick it up daily and have 
thirty days to develop it and give it to others between treatments. Killing the 
dog's parasites twice a week with a zapper would be very helpful to you. These 
heart parasites may not cause any pains, yet disturb the rhythm or the pulse of 
the heart and cause it to enlarge.</p> 
<p> Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium hiding out in far away places like 
pockets left under teeth when they were extracted or along root canals. Make 
sure extractions heal and don't leave permanent cavitations where bacteria can 
live. Ask a dentist familiar with cavitations to do a mouth search. Once the 
mouth source is cleaned up, the bacteria do not come back to the heart (after 
one last zapping). If they do, go back to the dentist!</p> 
<p> Killing these three invaders (heartworm, Loa loa, Staphylococcus aureus) 
should cure an irregular heart beat immediately (within a day).</p> 
<p> If the elderly person is on a heart-slowing drug, check the pulse twice a 
day after zapping to make sure it doesn't drop too low. They may need to be off 
their heart medicine. Nobody will notice the relief of going off this medicine 
as much as you. The sunshine breaks out! Your loved one can smile again at 
little things! Even interest in sex returns so watch out! Life is normalized 
when drugs, especially beta blockers are gone. (Other heart medicines, such as 
Digitoxin, don't have this depressive effect. They are used to make the heart 
beat stronger, not to affect the rate of beating.)</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++The pulse should be around 70 
beats per minute and perfectly regular. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> 
</pre> 
<p> If it isn't, there is still something wrong. Get rid of toxic body 
products and house pollutants. Test your air for gas leaks frequently. Gas 
heat, gas stoves and gas water heaters are notoriously leaky. Weather changes, 
namely temperature changes make pipes expand or shrink-leaving cracks! The gas 
is toxic and a small amount can't be smelled. What a predicament! Delivering 
poisonous house gas to our homes in pipes that are not fail-safe is an archaic 
practice. Especially when the blood test shows a high &quot;total CO2&quot; 
level, near the upper limit, search for an air pollutant like house gas or auto 
fumes. And read the sections in this book on pulse (page 289) and brain 
problems (page 278) very closely for more things to check.</p> 
<p> With the heart regular again, it will be much stronger, too, since it 
doesn't have to work against itself. This strength is necessary to push the 
blood into the farthest &quot;corners&quot; of the body, especially the hands 
and feet, and warm them up! If your loved constantly has cold hands or feed, 
try to improve circulation. Dissolve phosphate crystals with the kidney herb 
recipe. Give niacin (page 279). Give cayenne capsules (one with each meal). 
Blood thinning drugs to improve circulation are dangerous - use only if the 
doctor insists. Monitor blood clotting time if your loved one is on a thinner.
</p> 
<h3> Heart/Kidney Relationship </h3> 
<p> A strong heart is necessary, too, to push the blood through the kidneys. 
Often a kidney problem is linked to the heart disorder. Kidneys are made of 
tubes that get finer and finer. It takes pressure, namely strength, to push the 
blood through them so wastes and extra water can be let down the kidney tube. 
Think of the kidneys as a colander full of tiny holes of various sizes that let 
certain things through them but not bigger things. These holes are constantly 
being adjusted by the adrenals which sit right on top of the kidneys and 
&quot;supervise&quot;.</p> 
<p> If the elderly person is not producing four cups of urine in a day (24 
hours), it is not enough. The body cannot get enough cleansing action from less 
than four cups. More liquid must be consumed. If most of the urine is passed in 
the night this reflects on unhealthy kidneys. Use the kidney herb recipe-but 
only half a dose (so it will take six weeks instead of three to see good 
effects). As the tiny &quot;colander&quot; holes open up there is freer flow 
and many more trips to the bathroom result. The urine loses its awful odor (no 
ammonia, acetone and bacteria!) and gets a clear look that shows no sediment. 
Now that water and wastes (urea and uric acid and other acids) can leave the 
body quickly through more holes, it takes less pressure from the heart to get 
blood pushed through the kidneys. This brings relief to the heart because its 
work is easier. The heart and kidneys work together. Like horse and wagon the 
heart provides the power and the kidneys follow.</p> 
<p> This is why heart medicine and diuretics are commonly given together. 
Diuresis (urine flow) helps the heart and a stronger heart helps the kidneys. 
Similarly, they fail together. In the old days this was called dropsy. Urine 
that should have left the body is backed up in the tissues. Sometimes it shows 
up in pockets that hang like giant oranges from the skin.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Even (especially) when the 
strongest diuretics (Maxzide(TM), Lasix(TM)) +++fail to work, even when coupled 
with strong heart medicine +++(Digitoxin(TM)), the kidney herb recipe can bail 
you out of the +++emergency. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> The secret is in the varied actions of different herbs. This makes them 
work together. Be very careful to keep the herb tea sterile by reheating every 
fourth day. Freeze unused larger amounts. If too much is drunk at once, 
especially on the first day, a stomach ache can develop and a pressure felt in 
the bladder that is most uncomfortable. Go extra slow on the first few days, 
even though you find it quite tasty, so there is no discomfort (only lots of 
bathroom visits).</p> 
<h3> Diuretics </h3> 
<p> As soon as urine is flowing better, blood pressure may drop. Keep track of 
this twice a day with a modern electronic finger device (not an arm cuff that 
itself can break blood vessels). Cut down on drug diuretics gradually, using 
only 3/4 dose the first day, then 1/2 dose, then 1/4 dose. The amount of urine 
produced or the weight of the person can be used to assess how effective your 
method is. Your goal is to not need any drug diuretics. Again, mood will 
improve dramatically when diuretic drugs are removed for your loved one. The 
sense of humor comes back: be prepared for some new jokes and new laughter. 
Give yourself good grades for this accomplishment.</p> 
<p> Don't throw out the drug diuretics. After being off them for a while, they 
become more potent again. So if an emergency (sudden edema) should arise they 
could again be useful.</p> 
<p> With a parasite and pollution-free heart and a low-resistance, freely 
flowing kidney, some reserve strength will soon be built up. Weak spells are 
gone and forgotten. Your loved one is walking better, needing less sleep, and a 
&quot;golden age&quot; finally arrives. It is free of pain, free of medicine, 
free of shots and doctor visits, free of dementia, free of the dreadful 
weakness that demands so much help. They are free to enjoy family and friends 
again. Seeing themselves gain strength and be able to do more for themselves 
gives the elderly a sense of pride.</p> 
<p> Give them the credit for improving their health. When they balk at having 
to take herbs or vegetable juice, remind them of the days they were on a 
handful of pills and still had heart failure, pain and kidney disease.</p> 
<h2> Feeling Comfortable </h2> 
<p> If all this improvement doesn't warm up their feet or hands (feel them 
yourself) put extra socks on. Warming up their feet might have the effect of 
warming up hands, too. But if it doesn't, raise the room temperature.</p> 
<p> Being forced to feel cold is an undeserved misery of the aged. </p> 
<p> Others must accommodate to the elderly's need for body warmth. The 
thermometer does not tell all. Comfort is paramount for each of us. Younger 
persons can undress for comfort. The elderly can't make changes for themselves. 
Usually, by the time they are complaining of cold, they have suffered a long 
time, feeling too guilty to request a temperature hike. Ask your loved one. 
They will appreciate it. A shawl, a lap-blanket, woolen sweater, long underwear 
and fleecy thermal outerwear help a lot. But if your hand still senses cold 
feet, the thermostat must still go higher. Cold body temperature is an 
invitation for fungus and viruses to multiply. Viruses escape into the body 
daily. Don't give them the advantage.</p> 
<pre> Figure 39. Too hot and too cold. </pre> 
<p> But unless all these things are tried, don't raise the temperature. It is 
much healthier to be warmly dressed and breathe cool air than to be lightly 
dressed in an 80 degrees F room. The heart, especially, benefits by the cooler 
air temperature.</p> 
<p> For this reason, it is important to have air conditioning during the hot 
season. Keep your elderly person warmly dressed, away from air conditioner or 
fan drafts, but keep it cool. As cool as their body temperature and comfort 
will allow. Don't seat an elderly person under a fan in restaurants. The 
blowing air not only chills them, but brings filth in dust that blows in the 
air currents. Bacteria and viruses are soon to follow.</p> 
<p> Being comfortable, knowing you are there to care for them, brings out the 
best in your elderly person. They might get well enough to long for a genuine 
relationship again. And put you to the test. The test of listening. This can be 
very rewarding if they are still able to communicate and distill their life 
experience into wisdom for you. If you can listen and be interested in their 
distillations or their ramblings their longing for relationship will be 
fulfilled. There's just one catch, if the new found interest in communication 
can't be expressed. If they haven't communicated much for a long time, it would 
be easy for you to miss a simple fact. They can't hear!</p> 
<h2> Hearing Loss </h2> 
<p> The hearing deficit in an elderly person is always much greater than they 
or you realize. Try to understand these communications:</p> 
<pre> What you | What the elderly | What they think | What they respond 
(caregiver) say | person hears | | 
------------------+-------------------+------------------+------------------- 
Look at the sun- | Look at something | What a stupid | MmmHmmmm. shine, isn't 
it a | isn't it a | sentence. But | (Meaning &quot;yes&quot;.) nice day? | nice 
bay?&quot; | wants an answer. | | | So here goes. | 
------------------+-------------------+------------------+------------------- 
We'll have such a | Have a ... rock. | Rock what? I'm | nice walk. | | not in a 
rocking | | | chair. I better | | | not say anything.| 
------------------+-------------------+------------------+------------------- 
What kind of soup | What kind of hoop | I haven't used a | I don't know. should 
I make? | should I make? | hoop for | | | embroidery for a | | | long time. Why 
is| | | she digging that | | | up. I better say | | | I don't know. |</pre> 
<p> Don't let this ruin your relationship. It takes the fun out of their life 
as much as yours. Get hearing aids.</p> 
<p> Don't ask your loved one if they need a hearing aid. The answer may be 
&quot;I'm not deaf&quot;. You can go about it more persuasively. Every time you 
talk, come quite near to the person's ear and speak loudly. They can see that 
you must come near. If they are fighting against the whole business, they will 
say things like, &quot;You don't have to shout. I can hear you&quot;. (It's 
what you're saying that's wrong!)</p> 
<p> Arrange for a hearing test. It is free. That will appeal. The results of a 
hearing test, as it is told by a salesperson, is much more persuasive than you 
can be. Let the salesperson use his or her special talents to sell your loved 
one on hearing aids. But you make the choice on quality. Both you and your 
elderly person deserve the best tone quality that is made. Plus a regular 
cleaning service. Most companies do offer this but don't tell the customer 
because of the dreadful amount of time it would take if everybody took 
advantage of it. You take advantage of it. Clogged hearing aids are the most 
troublesome feature of any of them-and never mentioned! Make it a rule to buy 
your batteries at the same hearing aid office where they are cleaned free of 
charge. This repays them and serves the elderly best. Hearing loss is too 
subtle to leave to chance; have the hearing aids cleaned each time you buy 
fresh batteries (about three months). Take your loved one to a nurse for ear 
cleaning every six months after hearing aids are begun. Wax and debris 
accumulate behind the aid because the channel is stopped up.</p> 
<p> With hearing aids that hear, and kidneys that flush and a heart that beats 
strongly, your elderly person may choose to attend concerts again, go to church 
or gatherings-and leave you out of the picture. Give yourself good grades for 
this achievement. Get them incontinence pants, get regular taxi service. Do 
whatever it takes to get your loved one out into the world again!</p> 
<p> If the excitement of a night out keeps him or her from sleeping use 
ornithine and valerian capsules. They are good for the health anyway. Hot milk 
and a piece of cake (homemade, never chocolate) may do as much.</p> 
<p> But if insomnia is the rule, not the exception, you need to go after it as 
a special problem.</p> 
<h2> Insomnia </h2> 
<p> Insomnia is always associated with high levels of parasites and bacteria. 
This leads me to believe it is their waste products, namely ammonia, that 
really causes insomnia. Read the section on Insomnia under Sleep Problems for 
more on this (page 243).</p> 
<p> A sound sleep refreshes as nothing else can. Your elderly person will have 
more energy throughout the day and a better mood if sleep was good.</p> 
<p> Of course you must guard against daytime napping if nights are sleepless. 
Sleep at night is more important than sleep by day. They are not equal. Try to 
turn your loved one's cycle back to night-time sleeping if it has become turned 
around by bad kidney function (frequent urination at night) or too much daytime 
napping. Sleep can be disturbed by taking vitamins at bedtime too. Sleep is 
enhanced by taking magnesium. Limit bedtime supplements to magnesium, 
ornithine, valerian (6 capsules) taken with hot milk.</p> 
<h2> Healthful Habits </h2> 
<p> If your loved one had his or her way, they would drive the car forever, 
wear the same cosmetics forever, smoke or chew tobacco forever and eat their 
favorite dessert forever.</p> 
<p> But if you are the caretaker, you know that some things must stop. You 
also know that gentle persuasion is useless; it merely erodes your 
relationship. Here are a few tips.</p> 
<pre> 1. Ask your loved one to ask their doctor (clinical doctor or trusted 
medical advisor) the following question: &quot;Would it be better for my lungs 
to stop smoking?&quot; Be present so the question does not turn into &quot;Will 
smoking a few cigarets once in a while kill me?&quot; Hearing it from the 
doctor is what's needed. 2. Don't ever purchase something you believe is 
detrimental to your elderly person. Whether it's coffee, cigarets, beer or 
lipstick, say &quot;That is something I can't buy for you; it's against my 
principles&quot;. Don't be surprised if you cave in a few times to some super 
ruse they use on you. But the next time, have your answer ready. 3. Let your 
family and other caretakers know you are no longer supplying these items (the 
car keys, the wine bottle, the codeine-containing pain pills). Try to get 
cooperation. Discussing it with your loved one may do more harm than good. If 
they start the discussion, you end it. This is not a task for the timid! After 
it's done, you'll wonder what was so difficult. 4. Don't buy a wheelchair if 
your loved one can still walk with your help. Stay with a cane as long as 
possible. Then the walker. Stay with a walker as long as possible. Then your 
personal help. Once a wheelchair has been accepted, the last bit of exercise, 
walking, is lost. Fight against it. Hide it in a far away closet.</pre> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Aging is necessary but chronic 
illness and pain are not. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> If you have managed to free your loved one from having to take pills or 
from certain disabilities that would soon require pills, you can give yourself 
great credit. Perhaps you, too, will find the needed natural help when you are 
aged and have lost your authority and your way mentally. Our lives are all 
foreshortened, much like the life of a domestic steer's. Does a captive animal 
learn from seeing its companion disappear? It does nothing to escape its fate. 
Should we accept our fate with the same docility? None of us can remember how 
things were in precivilized times. We are eager to believe the present is the 
best time that has ever been. The steer, too, has its feed provided, its water 
provided, its shelter for the night provided, seemingly the best time it ever 
had. Perhaps the price we pay for civilization, like the steer's price, is 
simply too high. There must be other ways. As a society, we should search for 
our lost longevity.</p> 
<h2> Not Old Yet </h2> 
<p> For persons merely over 40 and not ill a most important rule is: don't 
overdo.</p> 
<p> It's easy to injure tendons and muscles by pulling or stretching them too 
far. Don't try, with almighty determination to open a jar. Leave it for 
stronger hands. Don't try to stretch a gigantic stretch to reach something on a 
high shelf. Wait for someone taller to come along and reach it down for you. 
Don't do exercises, that have left you with strains in the. past. Do different 
exercises. Don't do new exercises, with a determined approach; start 
moderately; stay moderate. If you start a new job that uses a foot, leg, hand 
or wrist a lot, more than it was used before, even though it's in ordinary use, 
it can feel injured. These stresses and strains invite bacteria toward 
themselves. Bacteria from the liver or your own intestines find these strained 
tissues immediately and intensify the pain. Kill the bacteria with a zapper, 
cleanse the liver, and start the Bowel Program if this has already happened to 
you.</p> 
<p> Don't kneel on the floor to do some cleaning job. Don't sit on the floor 
at a gathering. Don't let your grandchildren take &quot;rides&quot; on you. 
Don't bend over as far as you can to pick something up. Let your family know 
you are aiming to reach 100 years in healthy condition.</p> 
<h2> Super Longevity </h2> 
<p> We should be able to live to 140 years of age. Middle age might begin at 
65, old age at 90. What is the clue to long life? Surely it is keeping all your 
cells healthy so they can coordinate the constant tasks of nourishing 
themselves, removing their wastes, plus whatever job that cell was meant to do.
</p> 
<p> Since your cells divide and therefore start again at age zero, even though 
you are 90, why do you age at all? Only the nervous system does not divide. Is 
it the nerve that ages then, and decides death for each of us?</p> 
<p> It would never do to live forever. It would clutter the planet. Are 
evolutionary forces at work preventing this? But we have never cluttered the 
planet yet. So how could evolutionary forces have &quot;learned&quot; to 
establish death to prevent overpopulation? Living to age 140 is not living 
forever. Wisdom comes with age. Wisdom would serve our society well. Perhaps 
wisdom is needed more than ever for humans to survive. Part of the human 
tragedy is war. Wisdom gathered from a knowledge of history, might help end 
wars! But history can't be gathered and understood in less than 100 years. If 
centenarians can't think well or express themselves, their perspectives are 
lost. Longevity seems a very useful trait if only it were accompanied by health!
</p> 
<h2> Dying </h2> 
<p> Although it can't be avoided it can be helped. Dying alone is the most 
barbaric of all society's practices.</p> 
<p> It is still like death in the forest amongst chimpanzees. Unable to feed, 
to run, to call for help brings pain, fear, loneliness and finally, death. When 
your loved one is in the mood to talk about dying, listen. Especially if it is 
about their own imminent death. This doesn't obligate you to carry out any of 
their wishes. When death approaches the important thing is simply to be there. 
They may not have requested this, out of a sense of guilt or masochism, or 
plain dementia. But it is the most primitive of needs, the same as having a 
loved one nearby during childbirth. It is just a Presence that counts. How can 
you be there if you have a job or are attending a family's needs? It is a time 
of great frustration for you. All your hard work and successes are culminating 
in one grand failure!</p> 
<p> The good news is that it need not be you who attends your loved one every 
minute of the last week. Pay for someone to sit-someone who is recognized. But 
arrange for immediate privacy when you return. No matter how much your loved 
one admonishes you to go about your business, you will know when you share the 
final minute that your presence helped. The loneliness of the last coma, the 
last silence is unspeakable. Give yourself the reward of knowing you shared the 
pain, fear and silent cry for help.</p> 
<h1> Curing Cancer </h1> 
<p> Cancer is no longer the deadly disease it once was. In fact, you can clear 
it up in less time than it takes to get a doctor's appointment for a check up. 
If you notice a lump or think you might have cancer, don't rush to see a doctor 
first. Rush to clear it up, yourself, first. By the time your doctor's 
appointment arrives, you can be sure of a negative test.</p> 
<h2> Another Fluke Disease </h2> 
<p> Cancer is so easily cured because it is a parasite-caused disease. Kill 
the parasite and you have stopped the cancer. This does not mean you have also 
stopped being ill. If the cancer damaged your ovaries or prostate, you still 
must heal these organs. The Ca-125 or PSA test will not drop to normal unless 
you begin to heal them. These markers reflect the condition of the organ, not 
its malignant nature. Remember that killing a mosquito does not remove the lump 
it caused. That will take its course. It will heal beautifully if you let it. 
But if you scratch it mercilessly, it will take longer. Removing toxins from 
the affected organs lets them heal.</p> 
<p> Fortunately for us, cancer is not like a fire, unstoppable once it has 
started. It takes only 7 minutes to zap all the parasite adults and their 
stages which cause your cells to multiply.</p> 
<p> The responsible parasite is Fasciolopsis Buskii, the human intestinal 
fluke, a flatworm. It is a human parasite although it can also parasitize other 
species. It normally lives quietly in the intestine. (The goal for all larger 
parasites is to live quietly. After all, your demise is their demise.) They 
were meant to pass their thousands of eggs with your bowel movement, outside, 
to some pond where snails live. But when the eggs hatch before they leave your 
body and are allowed to continue their development inside you, the setting is 
right for cancer to develop.</p> 
<p> If the fluke eggs and other stages go through their development in your 
breast it can become breast cancer. If it is in the prostate it can become 
prostate cancer. And so on. Each different kind of cancer means the 
developmental stages of the intestinal fluke are present there. Only one more 
thing is needed to bring about an avalanche of reproduction, so that hundreds 
of little larvae turn into hundreds more in a short time: a growth factor. It 
makes them multiply and your cells are similarly affected. This growth factor, 
ortho-phospho-tyrosine (and possibly, also, epidermal growth factor and 
insulin-dependent growth factor) really begins your cancer.</p> 
<h2> Teamed With A Solvent </h2> The good news is that this growth factor, 
which is essential for cancer to develop, cannot be made, without the presence 
of an abnormal solvent, propyl alcohol (or more exactly, isopropyl alcohol).
<p> Without taking in propyl alcohol you could never get cancer. It takes two 
things, together, to give you cancer: propyl alcohol and the human intestinal 
fluke parasite.</p> 
<p> Since it takes a frequency generator (3 minutes at each of 434, 432, 427, 
425, 423, 421 KHz) or zapper mere minutes to kill the fluke and its stages you 
will be stopping the production of growth factors immediately.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Zap yourself every day for 
three seven minute periods, +++until after you are completely well. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> After killing the flukes, those 
growth factors already formed will disappear in one hour. Your malignancy is 
stopped. It cannot return unless you infect yourself with the parasite again!
<p> Getting rid of propyl alcohol is also a simple task. Once you have stopped 
using it, the last remnants leave your body within three days.</p> 
<p> We must marvel at the body's wisdom and capabilities for restoring health. 
You are not permanently damaged by this large and hungry parasite. Given half a 
chance your body will throw the rascals out and restore order in you tissues.
</p> 
<p> Read the list of foods and products that are polluted with propyl alcohol. 
It is not, of course, usually on the label. If it is used as an ingredient, it 
is on the label, easy for you to avoid. It is the pollutants not appearing on 
the label that pose sinister hazards.</p> 
<pre> Figure 40: Products with propyl alcohol. All the store bought shampoo I 
tested had propyl alcohol. Health brands were no exception. All bottled water 
is polluted with antiseptics from the bottling proceedure. This is a main 
source of propyl alcohol. Cosmetics are laced with propyl alcohol. Use the 
recipes in this book to make your own.</pre> 
<h2> Propyl Alcohol Polluted Products </h2> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++THROW THESE OUT even if propyl 
alcohol is not listed on the label! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> - 
shampoo, even health brands - hair spray and mousse - cold cereals, even 
&quot;natural&quot; granolas - cosmetics (make your own) - mouthwash - 
decaffeinated coffee, Postum(TM), herb tea blends (single herb teas are OK) - 
vitamins, minerals and supplements (unless you test them) - bottled water, 
distilled water, or spring water - rubbing alcohol - white sugar (brown is OK 
if detoxified) - all shaving supplies including aftershave - carbonated 
beverages - store-bought fruit juice, including health food brands</pre> 
<p> Tear out this page, put it on your refrigerator, and make a copy to stick 
on your medicine cabinet. Remember propyl alcohol is also called propanol, 
isopropanol, isopropyl alcohol and rubbing alcohol. You won't drop dead from 
getting propyl alcohol, but your cancer will flare up with each small addition.
</p> 
<p> Avoid the entire list, meticulously. Even using one of these, like your 
favorite shampoo or bottled water, will result in failure. Your body will 
continue to make human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the pathology will 
remain &quot;indeterminate&quot; - not cancerous but not well, either. If you 
have learned the new bioelectronic technology described in this book, you can 
test all your foods and products for isopropyl alcohol.</p> 
<p> When you find a beverage that is free of propyl alcohol, it may have other 
pollutants. Xylene and toluene invite parasites to the brain. Wood alcohol 
invites them to eyes and pancreas. The diseases caused by these are not as 
frightening, perhaps, as cancer, but entirely avoidable. For this reason, I 
suggest in this book that you go back (actually &quot;forward&quot;) to self 
made products, unprocessed food and a limited number of tested supplements.</p> 
<h2> Getting Well After Cancer </h2> 
<p> The ravages of cancer must be healed once the malignancy has been stopped. 
This is where carcinogens play a role. The lung lesions will not heal unless 
cigarette smoking, freon, asbestos, and fiberglass exposure is stopped. 
Carcinogens were thought to be the cause of cancer. Actually, they drew the 
cancer to the organ. Nickel draws cancer to the prostate. Barium found in 
lipstick draws cancer to the breast. And so on.</p> 
<p> The following toxins can be present in any organ! I consider these to be 
our most serious threat. Starting with the worst, they are:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Freon (same as CFCs or refrigerant). I have not found a single person to 
be entirely free of it, including persons without cancer or disease. But in 
cancer sufferers it is always concentrated in the cancerous organ, and 
facilitates the accumulation of other toxins. This makes your refrigerator, if 
it leaks even microscopically, the top cancer hazard in the country!</li> 
<li>Copper from water pipes. All cancer sufferers have an accumulation in the 
cancerous tissue. This makes plumbing the second greatest hazard.</li> 
<li>Fiberglass or asbestos is present in about 25% of the cancer victims that 
I see.</li> 
<li>Mercury as in tooth fillings. </li> 
<li>Lead from solder joints in copper plumbing. All colon cancer sufferers 
test positive.</li> 
<li>Formaldehyde as in foam bedding and new clothing. </li> 
<li>Nickel usually from dental metal. Most prostate cancer sufferers test 
positive.</li> </ol> 
<p> At first, tumors are benign - what a relief to find your tumor was benign. 
Its true nature is still unknown, but it contains freon, other toxins, and 
later propyl alcohol! Since tumors are often large, many centimeters in 
diameter, and toxins do not occupy much space, there is much unidentified 
substance. These tumors can multiply and enlarge, as in fibrocystic breast 
disease, all without being malignant. But what a convenient place for baby 
stages of the fluke to hide out and multiply, safe from your immune system. 
After being colonized by fluke stages, the tumors become malignant. Eventually 
they also become infected when metastasis sets in.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++All malignancies have the same 
two fundamental causes: +++intestinal flukes and propyl alcohol. Whether you 
have +++a rhabdomyosarcoma or a mesothelioma or melanoma, +++you can cure it 
quickly, never to return. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h2> Herbal Parasite Killing Program </h2> 
<p> Flatworms, roundworms, protozoa, even bacteria and viruses are remarkably 
easy to kill using a combination of zapping and this herbal program. Thus it is 
not just for cancer, but a general treatment that can benefit almost every 
illness.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength (see the Recipes chapter, page 
543):
<pre> Day 1: (this is the day you begin; start the same day you receive it) 
Take one drop. Put it in 1/2 cup of water. Sip it on an empty stomach such as 
before a meal. Day 2: Take 2 drops in l/2 cup water same as above. Day 3: Take 
3 drops in l/2 cup water same as above. Day 4: Take 4 drops in l/2 cup water 
same as above. Day 5: Take S drops in l/2 cup water same as above. Day 6: Take 
2 tsp., all together in 1/4 cup water. Sip it, don't gulp it. Get it down 
within 15 minutes. (If you are over 150 pounds, take 2 1/2 tsp. Do not take 
more than 3 tsp. because no additional value has been observed.)</pre> This 
dose kills any remaining stages throughout the body, including the bowel 
contents, a location unreachable by electric current. The alcohol in the 
tincture can make you slightly woozy for several minutes. Simply stay seated 
until you are comfortable again. You may put the tincture in lukewarm water to 
help evaporate some of the alcohol, but do not use hot water because that may 
damage its parasiticide power. Then take niacinamide 500 mg to counteract the 
toxicity of the alcohol. You could also feel a slight nausea for a few minutes. 
Walk in the fresh air or simply rest until it passes. You may add more water or 
honey or a spice to make it more palatable.
<p> For a year: take 2 tsp. Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength every 
week or until your illness is but a hazy memory. This is to kill any parasite 
stages you pick up from your family, friends, or pets.</p>
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Family members and friends 
should take 2 tsp. every other week to +++avoid reinfecting you. They may be 
harboring a few parasite stages in +++their intestinal tract without having 
symptoms. But when these stages +++are transmitted to a cancer patient, they 
immediately seek out the +++cancerous organ again. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> You may be wondering why you 
should wait for five days before taking the 2 tsp. dose. It is for your 
convenience only. You may have a sensitive stomach or be worried about toxicity 
or side effects. By the sixth day you will have convinced yourself there is no 
toxicity or side effects.
<p> Going faster: <br>
 In fact, if you are convinced after the first drop of 
the restorative powers of Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength, take the 2 
tsp. dose on the very first day.</p>
<p> Going slower: <br>
 On the other hand, if you cringe at the thought of 
taking an herb or you are anxious about it's safety, continue the drops, 
increasing at your own pace, until you are ready to brave the decisive 2 tsp. 
dose.</p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Wormwood capsules (should contain 200-300 mg of wormwood, see the Sources 
chapter):
<pre> Day 1: Take 1 capsule before supper (with water). Day 2: Take 1 capsule 
before supper Day 3: Take 2 capsules before supper. Day 4: Take 2 capsules 
before supper.</pre> Continue increasing in this way to day 14, whereupon you 
are up to seven capsules. You take the capsules all in a single dose (you may 
take a few at a time until they are all gone). Then you do 2 more days of 7 
capsules each. After this, you take 7 capsules once a week forever, as it 
states in the Maintenance Parasite Program. Try not to get interrupted before 
the 6th day, so you know the adult intestinal flukes are dead. After this, you 
may proceed more slowly if you wish. Many persons with sensitive stomachs 
prefer to stay longer on each dose instead of increasing according to this 
schedule. You may choose the pace after the sixth day.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Cloves: 
<p> Fill size 00 capsules with fresh ground cloves; if this size is not 
available, use size O or 000. In a pinch, buy gelatin capsules and empty them 
or empty other vitamin capsules. You may be able to purchase fresh ground 
cloves that are already encapsulated; they should be about 500 mg. Grocery 
store ground cloves do not work! Either grind them yourself or see the Sources 
chapter.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre> Day 1: Take one capsule 3 times a day before meals. Day 2: Take two 
capsules 3 times a day. Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10: Take three capsules 3 
times a day.</pre> After day 10: Take 3 capsules all together once a week 
forever as in the Maintenance Parasite Program.
<p> Take ornithine at bedtime for insomnia. Even if you do not suffer from 
insomnia now, you may when you kill parasites.</p></li> </ol>

<p> Continue on the Maintenance Parasite Program, indefinitely, to prevent 
future reinfection.</p> 
<h2> Maintenance Parasite Program </h2> 
<p> YOU ARE ALWAYS PICKING UP PARASITES! PARASITES ARE EVERYWHERE AROUND YOU! 
YOU GET THEM FROM OTHER PEOPLE, YOUR FAMILY, YOURSELF, YOUR HOME, YOUR PETS, 
UNDERCOOKED MEAT, AND UNDERCOOKED DAIRY PRODUCTS.</p> 
<p> I believe the main source of the intestinal fluke is undercooked meat. 
After we are infected with it this way, we can give it to each other through 
blood, saliva, semen, and breast milk, which means kissing on the mouth, sex, 
nursing, and child-bearing.</p> 
<p> Family members nearly always have the same parasites. If one person 
develops cancer or HIV, the others probably have the intestinal fluke also. 
These diseases are caused by the same parasite. They should give themselves the 
same de-parasitizing program.</p> 
<p> Do this once a week. You may take these at different times in the day or 
together:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength: 2 tsp. on an empty stomach, 
like before a meal.</li> 
<li>Wormwood capsules: 7 capsules (with 200-300 mg wormwood each) at once on 
an empty stomach.</li> 
<li>Cloves: 3 capsules (about 500 mg. each, or fill size 00 capsules yourself) 
at once on an empty stomach.</li> 
<li> Take ornithine as needed. </li> </ol>

<p> The only after-effects you may feel are due to bacteria and viruses 
escaping from dead parasites! Be sure to zap after taking your maintenance 
parasite treatment. After-effects also let you know that you did indeed kill 
something. Try to discover how you might have picked up parasites and avoid 
them next time.</p> 
<h2> Pet Parasite Program </h2> 
<p> Pets have many of the same parasites that we get, including Ascaris 
(common roundworm), hookworm, Trichinella, Strongyloides, heartworm and a 
variety of tapeworms. Every pet living in your home should be deparasitized 
(cleared of parasites) and maintained on a parasite program. Monthly trips to 
your vet are not sufficient.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++You may not need to get rid of 
your pet to keep yourself free of +++parasites. But if you are quite ill it is 
best to board it with a +++friend until you are better. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Your pet is part of your family and should be kept as sweet and clean and 
healthy as yourself. This is not difficult to achieve. Here is the recipe:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Parsley water: cook a big bunch of fresh parsley in a quart of water for 
3 minutes. Throw away the parsley. After cooling, you may freeze most of it in 
several 1 cup containers. This is a month's supply. Put 1 tsp. parsley water on 
the pet's food. You don't have to watch it go down. Whatever amount is eaten is 
satisfactory.
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++All dosages are based on a 10 
pound (5 kilo) cat or dog. +++Double them for a 20 pound pet, and so forth. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> Pets are so full of parasites, 
you must be quite careful not to deparasitize too quickly. The purpose of the 
parsley water is to keep the kidneys flowing well so dead parasite refuse is 
eliminated promptly. They get quite fond of their parsley water. Perhaps they 
can sense the benefit it brings them. Do this for a week before starting the 
Black Walnut Hull Tincture.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Black Walnut Hull Tincture (regular strength): 1 drop on the food. Don't 
force them to eat it. Count carefully. Treat cats only twice a week. Treat dogs 
daily, for instance a 30 pound dog would get 3 drops per dav (but work up to 
it, increasing one drop per day). Do not use Extra Strength.
<p> If your pet vomits or has diarrhea, you may expect to see worms. This is 
extremely infectious and hazardous. Never let a child clean up a pet mess. 
Begin by pouring salt and iodine (&quot;Povidone&quot; iodine, topical 
antiseptic, is available in most drug stores) on the mess and letting it stand 
for 5 minutes before cleaning it up. Clean up outdoor messes the same way. 
Finally, clean your hands with diluted grain alcohol (dilute 1 part alcohol 
with 4 parts water) or vodka. Be careful to keep all alcohol out of sight of 
children; don't rely on discipline for this. Be careful not to buy isopropyl 
rubbing alcohol for this purpose.</p>
<p> Start the wormwood a week later. </p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Wormwood capsules: (200-300 mg wormwood per capsule) open a capsule and 
put the smallest pinch possible on their dry food. Do this for a week before 
starting the cloves.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Cloves: put the smallest pinch possible on their dry food. </li> </ol> 
<p> Keep all of this up as a routine so that you need not fear your pets. 
Also, notice how peppy and happy they become.</p> 
<p> Go slowly so the pet can learn to eat all of it. </p> 
<pre> To repeat: Week 1: parsley water. Week 2: parsley water and black 
walnut. Week 3: parsley water, black walnut, and wormwood. Week 4: parsley 
water, black walnut, wormwood, and cloves. | Parsley | Black Walnut | Wormwood

<h2> Parasites Gone, Toxins Next </h2> 
<p> Healing is automatic when you clean up your body tissues. Killing 
parasites and bacterial and viral invaders is fundamental. Removing toxins 
which invite them into your organs is even more fundamental.</p> 
<p> How do you know which toxins are responsible for your cancer? Unless you 
use a Syncrometer to test, you can not know. So learn to use a Syncrometer, it 
will save your life.</p> 
<p> The only other alternative is to move to a safer environment. Go on 
vacation. Stay in hotels less than ten years old (so the plumbing hasn't 
started to corrode) but not in new construction (give the carpets time to 
outgas). Do not have a freon containing refrigerator in your room. Do not use 
the hair drier they supply. Do not let them spray your room with anything. 
Launder the sheets and towels yourself at a Laundromat with borax and/or 
washing soda. Don't hesitate to drink the municipal water. Get busy with your 
dental cleanup.</p> 
<p> When you get better on vacation, let that be your inspiration to move from 
your home. All of the toxins come from a civilized lifestyle. Resolve to leave 
it behind. Select a warm climate where you can spend your time outdoors in the 
shade most of the day. Have no refrigerator, air conditioner, clothes dryer, 
hair dryer, new clothing, detergent. Check that the plumbing is relatively new 
and that no pesticide is being used. Make the Easy Lifestyle Improvements (page 
397). Throw away non-essential health supplements (unless tested) and drugs. 
The risk is greater than the benefit.</p> 
<h2> Watch For Bacteria </h2> 
<p> In the later stages of cancer the tumors are more and more infected with 
the common bacteria Salmonella, Shigella, and Staphylococcus aureus. Killing 
parasites prepares a feast for these ubiquitous bacteria. Now, more than ever, 
must you stay off dairy products (except for boiled milk), do the Bowel 
Program, take Lugol's. Remove Staphs by doing the dental cleanup (page 409). 
Don't delay.</p> 
<h2> Help Your Family, Too </h2> 
<p> If you had cancer, your whole family should be freed of intestinal fluke 
parasites to protect you! They may not be getting cancer (yet!) but your 
closeness puts you at risk. Kissing on the mouth could reinfect you. Request 
that family members zap themselves and take at least one 2 tsp. dose of Black 
Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength while living with you.</p> 
<p> Pets, too, can be a source of cancer fluke stages (in their drool). They 
get propyl alcohol from their feed. Use unflavored, uncolored feed for them to 
minimize pollution from processing. Add 1 tbs. vitamin C powder to the top of a 
5 lb. bag; it will stick to the pellets as they pour out. Zap your pet along 
with yourself by holding them and touching a bare spot such as nose or paw.</p> 
<p> Never eat rare meats or fast food chicken. Parasite stages survive heat up 
to the boiling point. If you have taken a risk, zap yourself as soon as you get 
home to minimize the damage.</p> 
<p> Cancer could be completely eliminated in the entire country if laws 
required testing for solvents in animal feeds and human food and products. 
Presently it is allowed in the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
(see page 428)!</p> 
<p> Another reason for propyl alcohol pollution (and other pollutants) in our 
food are the chemicals used by manufacturers to sterilize their food handling 
equipment.</p> 
<pre> 21 CFR 178.1010 (4-1-94 Edition) Sanitizing solutions. Sanitizing 
solutions may be safely used on food-processing equipment and utensils, and on 
other food-contact articles as specified in this section, within the following 
prescribed conditions: (a) Such sanitizing solutions are used, followed by 
adequate draining, before contact with food. [Note rinsing or drying is not 
required!] (b) The solutions consist of one of the following, to which may be 
added components generally recognized as safe and components which are 
permitted by prior sanction or approval. [Now comes (I) through (43) 
permissible sterilizing solutions, including several with isopropyl alcohol, 
like:] (25) An aqueous solution containing elemental iodine (CAS Reg. No. 
7553-56-2), potassium iodide (CAS Reg. No. 7681-11-O), and isopropanol (CAS 
Reg. No. 67-63-0). In addition to use on food processing equipment and 
utensils, this solution may be used on beverage containers, including milk 
containers and equipment and on food-contact surfaces in public eating places. 
[Then in paragraph (c)(19) the exact concentration of the iodine is specified. 
Nowhere is the concentration of the isopropanol specified. It can be as strong 
as desired.]</pre> 
<pre> Figure 41: U.S. regulations on sterilizing solutions. </pre> 
<p> Even if there were regulations governing removal of sanitizing solutions, 
the overwhelming truth is missed: that nothing can ever be completely removed 
after it has been added. Or perhaps the lawmakers didn't miss this fact. 
Perhaps they believed that small amounts - too small to measure with an 
ultraviolet spectrophotometer - could surely do no harm.</p> 
<p> Meanwhile, protect yourself by avoiding propyl alcohol. And by observing 2 
extra rules:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Never eat moldy foods.</li> 
<li>Always take vitamin C.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Aflatoxin </h2> 
<p> A common mold found on bread, nuts and fruit and in beer, apple cider 
vinegar and syrups, produces aflatoxin. This is what prevents you from 
detoxifying tiny bits of propyl alcohol that get into your body!</p> 
<p> Buy bakery bread or bake your own. Roast nuts after washing in vitamin C 
water to destroy aflatoxin and then store in refrigerator. Keep moldy fruit out 
of the refrigerator where the spores can spread. Use only white distilled 
vinegar. Use honeys instead of syrups and even add vitamin C to them.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Vitamin C helps your body 
detoxify all the mold toxins +++I have tested, including aflatoxin. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Keep powdered vitamin C in a salt shaker. It belongs on the table with 
salt and pepper, and at the stove. Put it in everything possible, from cereal 
to soup to rice (1/8 tsp. is enough). Besides this take 1/8 tsp. powdered 
vitamin C with each meal (500 mg).</p> 
<p> Developing cancer is a chain of events. This explains why it is a disease 
of aging. For ten years or more you poisoned your body with freon, fiberglass, 
asbestos, mercury, lead, copper, etc. You continually ate moldy food (chips, 
nuts, etc.) which was toxic to the liver. But the liver regenerated the pieces 
that died. Eventually a mold toxin prevents the liver from regenerating. Your 
aflatoxin-ed liver then lets propyl alcohol build up after using it. You use 
more and more propyl alcohol.</p> 
<pre> Figure 42: Keep both salt and vitamin C powders in closable plastic 
shakers.</pre> 
<p> Somewhere, over the years, you pick up the intestinal fluke in a hamburger 
or from a pet or person. The stage is set and cancer is inevitable.</p> 
<p> But pull out any one of the links in this chain and cancer is impossible. 
Pull them all out for a return to good health.</p> 
<p> So cure yourself, prevent reinfection, heal the damage and go through life 
without this sword hanging over you.</p> 
<p> Over 100 consecutive case histories of cured cancer victims are the 
subject of another book (The Cure For All Cancers, by the same author, 
ProMotion Publishing, 1993) along with more detailed instructions and 
suggestions.</p> 
<h1> Curing HIV/AIDS </h1> 
<p> HIV and AIDS disease are very similar to cancer. That is why cancer is so 
often seen with HIV/AIDS. It is caused by the same parasite but the solvent is 
benzene instead of propyl alcohol.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++HIV stands for Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus. +++ +++AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome. +++ +++Many researchers believe HIV causes AIDS. +++I observe them 
both caused by parasites and solvents! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> 
</pre> 
<p> When the body can no longer detoxify benzene it soon may not be able to 
detoxify propyl alcohol. Food mold, at the base of the propyl alcohol problem, 
is also at the base of the benzene problem. Zearalenone, a mycotoxin I find in 
popcorn, corn chips, and brown rice specifically inhibits detoxification of 
benzene. None of us should be eating these foods untested.</p> 
<p> Several common mold toxins inhibit the immune system, too, specifically 
those white blood cells that are supposed to eat and destroy viruses. 
Consequently, the HIV virus cannot be checked once it is introduced in the body.
</p> 
<p> Benzene goes to the bone marrow where T-cells are made, and to the thymus 
where T-cells are programmed, two big blows to the immune system.</p> 
<p> Benzene, a most unthinkable pollutant, is widespread in extremely small 
amounts. But when benzopyrenes are added, the total is entirely too much for 
the liver and it begins to accumulate in your thymus.</p> 
<pre> Figure 43: Grilled food has benzopyrenes as do hot dogs and &quot;smoke 
flavored&quot; foods.</pre> 
<p> Benzopyrenes are made right in your food by direct flame-heat. Grilled 
food, smoked food, hot dogs and lunch meats with &quot;smoke flavor&quot; all 
have benzopyrenes - even toast has it. Food fried in a skillet does not (even 
if you burn it black!). As the thymus deteriorates from its benzene burden so 
does your immunity.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Without benzene in your body 
you can't get AIDS. +++Without the intestinal fluke in your body you can't get 
HIV. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> After killing the parasite and its stages the HIV virus will be gone in 2 
hours, almost as quickly as the cancer marker, orthophospho-tyrosine. It is not 
necessary to zap the virus itself at 365 KHz.</p> 
<p> But the AIDS is not gone. This depends on removing benzene from your body 
and keeping it out of your body. Keeping it out on alternate days or 5 days of 
the week will not suffice. It must be out consistently. Only then can your 
thymus and bone marrow recover.</p> 
<p> As your thymus recovers your immunity returns. Immunity to all the 
diseases that lurk at very low level in our bodies. They are already in us. We 
have accumulated them in a lifetime. Mumps, measles, chicken pox, CMV, 
Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, are all there. Until now they have been 
controlled - kept down - by an ever vigilant immune system. If this system 
fails you are an easy target for any and all of these invaders.</p> 
<h2> Method Of Treatment </h2> 
<p> As soon as you find you are HIV positive, don't panic. It was inevitable. 
It is also inevitable for many others with unexplainable risk factors. If you 
have a source of infection with the intestinal fluke and at the same time a 
source of benzene, HIV and AIDS are a logical result. You must stop the source 
of both.</p> 
<p> Purchase or make a zapper or use somebody's frequency generator (434 KHz 
to 421 KHz giving 3 minutes to each KHz). Kill your flukes immediately. Take 
vitamin B2 immediately to help detoxify benzene (three 100 mg. tablets 3 times 
a day, 9 altogether). Zap daily until you feel completely well: no night 
sweats, no coughing, no symptoms of any kind.</p> 
<p> Remember parasites are all around us. We pick them up daily. And your 
weakened immune system lets everything gain a foothold in your body. Avoiding 
benzene will restore your immunity. Use the benzene pollution list to guide you.
</p> 
<h2> Benzene Polluted Products </h2> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++THROW THESE OUT +++ +++Your 
health is worth more than the fortune you spent on them! 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> - Flavored food, yogurt, Jell-O(TM), 
candies, throat lozenges, store-bought cookies, cakes - Cooking oil and 
shortening (use only olive oil, butter and lard) - Bottled water, whether 
distilled, spring, mineral, or name brand. Bottled fruit juice. - Cold cereal, 
including granola and health brands - Toothpaste, including health brands - Ice 
cream and frozen yogurt - Rice cakes, even the plain ones - Chewing gum - Pills

extracts and prescription drugs. Test yours and switch brands until you find a 
safe one. - Vaseline products (Noxzema(TM), Vick'S(TM), Lip Therapy(TM)), chap 
stick, hand cleaners - Vitamins and other health supplements, unless tested. - 
Personal lubricant, including lubricated condoms - Baking soda and cornstarch 
(see the Sources chapter) - Tea Tree oil products (except the one shown in 
Figure 45) - Soaps, hand creams, skin creams, moisturizers - Flavored pet food, 
both for cats and dogs - Bird food made into cakes</pre> 
<pre> Figure 44: Mexican made candy with no benzene. </pre>

100% Pure Tea Tree Oil Antiseptic)</pre> 
<p> Tear out that page, put it on your refrigerator, and make a copy to stick 
on your medicine cabinet. There is not a single item on this list that you can 
take a chance on.</p> 
<p> Learn to use the Syncrometer to do your own testing. While you are 
learning, observe the rules perfectly. There is no half way measure with 
benzene. Take an attitude of over compliance, not &quot;getting away&quot; with 
as much as possible. Over compliance can bring back radiant health, strength 
you never knew you had, a beautiful normal body again! You will be able to 
resume your plans for education, professional life, personal relationships, 
free of the sword hanging over you. You will not be infectious to anybody. Let 
over-compliance enthuse you.</p> 
<pre> Figure 46: Every brand of popcorn and corn chips I tested had 
zearalenone contamination.</pre> 
<p> There are 2 extra rules that help eliminate benzene buildup: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Never eat moldy or grilled foods including popcorn, corn chips, grocery 
store breads, pasta, nuts, alcoholic beverages, toast, brown rice (white is OK).
</li> 
<li> Always take Vitamin B2 (three 100 mg tablets three times a day) and 
vitamin C (1/8 tsp. with each meal).</li> </ol> 
<h2> Plan For The Future </h2> 
<p> After you are well again, you may wish to indulge in some philosophy. How 
did an obscure virus - a snail virus! - become a human virus? This is not so 
bizarre. After all, rabies virus comes to us from animals, and many 
encephalitis viruses come from mosquitoes. How did HIV spread so rapidly? How 
did a pollutant as dangerous as benzene get to be in our very food? Are other 
parasites getting set to spring on us? What must be done to protect ourselves 
and loved ones from future disasters? Would getting away from fossil fuel be a 
big answer? Would getting away from preoccupation with chemistry be a big 
answer? Would more disclosure of industrial practices be an answer? Should the 
government agencies responsible for food and product safety be depoliticized? 
Should public inspection of food manufacturing be a right? Should disclosure of 
foreign origins of food ingredients be mandatory? Would communicating with 
other cancer and AIDS survivors be useful? The computer age would make 
communication possible. Communication leads to answers. Answers might lead to 
new policies. Policies supported at the grass roots level can bring about 
change.</p> 
<p> Over 50 case histories of cured HIV victims are the subject of another 
book (The Cure for HIV and AIDS by the same author, ProMotion Publishing, 1993) 
along with more detailed instructions and suggestions.</p> 
<h1> Curing The Common Cold </h1> 
<p> Sometimes you can zap Adenovirus, the common cold virus, at 393 KHz for 
three minutes with a frequency generator and be rid of your cold, magically, in 
five minutes. But magic and luck are not really responsible for this. And most 
of the time the cold will reappear a few hours later.</p> 
<p> Homeopathy, too, can immediately banish your cold symptoms. The reason is 
not mysterious either. But, this time, the cold reappears later in a different 
location. Choose the right homeopathic remedy for that, and you can chase it 
away again.</p> 
<h2> Tapeworm Stage or Mites </h2> 
<p> The fascinating story of how we really &quot;catch&quot; a cold kept me 
spellbound for a year. I was hot on the heels of Adenovirus wherever it might 
be in my body. Sometimes I saw it; sometimes I didn't. Sometimes I had cold 
symptoms; sometimes I didn't. Sometimes I could zap it; sometimes it did no 
good.</p> 
<p> It is now apparent to me that Adenovirus isn't our (a human) virus at all! 
It belongs to other parasites. Parasites as varied as tapeworm stages and 
mites. Perhaps it belongs to many other parasites, as well. My evidence comes 
from a tapeworm stage, cysticercus of Diphyllobothrium Erinacea, the mites 
Sarcoptes and Dermatophagoides, and our own colon bacteria, E. coli.</p> 
<p> The tapeworm stage flies in the dust as eggs, you can trap these by 
setting out a pint jar with a little water in it. In three days' time you are 
likely to find its frequency near 487 KHz in your jar. You are also likely to 
find it on your kitchen sponge, since you wipe up dust each day. To test it, 
place it in a plastic bag, wet it thoroughly and search from 510 KHz downward, 
one KHz at a time. The various tapeworm stages emit between 510 and 440 KHz.</p>
<p> If you have a household pet, you will always be able to find a tapeworm 
stage in your sponge or in a dust sample you collect from the table or kitchen 
counter in the morning. Gather dust with a damp bit of paper towel, put it in a 
plastic bag. Then wash your hands or you may accidentally eat some.</p> 
<p> This, of course, happens to every household member. Eating the dust off 
the tables, inhaling the dust, and eating off surfaces wiped by the kitchen 
sponge happens to everyone. And everyone &quot;catches&quot; colds. If you 
search for Adenovirus, though, in your dust sample, it isn't there!</p> 
<p> Similarly, you can search for the mites in your house dust. Search near 
the frequencies given for them. There is a good chance you will have one that 
is not given, because the list is so incomplete. Name it after yourself. 
Compare notes with others; maybe it is common, maybe it's a rare one. Again, 
you will not find Adenovirus beeping its characteristic frequency out of your 
mite specimen. Why not? Possibly, it is too faint; it must multiply and create 
a loud chorus before you can hear it. But multiply it will, if given a chance, 
in you. You must, of course, first eat or inhale the dust.</p> 
<p> Then the tape eggs hatch into the cysticercus stage, which promptly gets 
to the liver. Sometimes it gets to other organs, like the muscles, the spleen, 
the pancreas. Presumably the liver screened it out of the blood originally.</p> 
<p> Soon you will zap them, wherever they are. If you are using a slide 
specimen of cysticercus you can locate it in your body. If you are only 
listening to its beeps, you can't. If you can do both, you may be able to see 
which organ allows the virus to replicate after it emerges. Maybe only the 
respiratory organs do; maybe they start to replicate in the organ where they 
emerge, such as the liver and then get to the respiratory tract. This is a 
fascinating avenue that I have not yet explored.</p> 
<p> Mites are inhaled or swallowed or both, just as tapeworm eggs are. They 
are on your kitchen sponge, and in any food or dishes that stand uncovered 
anywhere in the home. Never drink water from a glass that has &quot;stood 
out&quot; all day. After finding one, you will notice it beeping in you for 
several days. Then the beep disappears; presumably the mite is dead.</p> 
<p> The tapeworm stage beeps may disappear in a few days, too, presumably 
dead. Except in cases of disease. Muscles that are diseased will take in the 
newcomer and allow it to survive adding to the parasites and pollutants already 
there! Evidently the immune power of such diseased locations is way down.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++On the day that the mite stops 
beeping, +++the day it dies, Adenovirus appears! 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Not many Adenovirus at first. You will need to search several times during 
the day to find it in your white blood cells. (And you have no symptoms, yet, 
either!) Is it a coincidence that Adenovirus appeared directly after a tapeworm 
stage or mite died?</p> 
<p> You can find out by waiting until a time when you have a tapeworm stage or 
mite and no Adenovirus. Then kill your tapeworm stage or mite by zapping for 
seven minutes. Within minutes after that, the beeping of the tapeworm stage or 
mite is gone and Adenovirus can be heard, loud and clear at 393 KHz! And 
minutes later you may feel a stuffy nose, a slight congestion developing, a 
certain head feeling that is different. You are &quot;catching&quot; a cold!</p>
<p> Will you really get this cold? Will it become a full blown cold of the 
usual kind? After seeing this happen dozens of times after killing a mite or 
tapeworm stage I concluded that Adenovirus really belongs to them; the virus is 
scuttling its dying host like people jumping off a sinking ship into the ocean. 
Our bodies are the ocean for them. They too, immediately swim and search for a 
hospitable island. Our respiratory tract is such an island; perhaps other 
organs, too.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Yes, this &quot;baby 
cold&quot; will develop into a full blown cold if, +++but only if, you have a 
mold in you! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h2> Molds and Colds </h2> 
<p> This is part two of the cold story. You may have Adenoviruses quietly 
slipping into your blood stream and tissues from a tapeworm stage or mite you 
inhaled, or E. coli bacteria that strayed into your tissues, and which is being 
slowly killed by your immune system. Your immune system can keep up with them 
quite easily provided you don't have a mold in you at the same time. The 
significance of the mold is that it lowers your immunity, specifically and 
generally.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Mold eluded, is health 
improved. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> This has already been studied extensively for a number of food molds. 
There are a variety of ways that mold toxins lower immunity. Some simply kill 
white blood cells. Others seem to &quot;bind and gag&quot; them so they just 
can't go about eating viruses.</p> 
<p> So with mold toxins present, Adenovirus, fleeing the dead tapeworm stage, 
mite, or E. coli is not gobbled up. It has time to get to its favorite organ 
and enter the cells there. It may get in your lungs if they're full of arsenic 
or formaldehyde, in your throat if it's full of mercury from your fillings, in 
your spinal cord if it's full of thallium. Sometimes you feel the viral attack, 
sometimes you don't.</p> 
<p> When E. coli is the source of your Adenovirus, a question pops up. Why 
don't you have a perpetual cold, since these bacteria are always in your 
colon... and should be! As long as E. coli stays dutifully in your colon, no 
Adenovirus is seen. But as soon as any cross the colon wall to invade your 
body, your white blood cells pounce on them. After this, Adenovirus appears and 
again you are catching a cold. They may go to your internal organs where you 
don't feel them.</p> 
<p> One place you do feel an attack is in your respiratory tract: lungs, 
bronchi, sinuses, nose, Eustachian tubes, inner ear, eyes or head. And the size 
of the attack depends on whether you recently ate moldy food.</p> 
<p> Human food (in general, in the U.S.) is very, very moldy. We do not taste 
it because manufacturers have been using more and more flavorings in food. This 
covers up small amounts of mold or &quot;off&quot; flavor. Measures to reduce 
mold are not effective enough.</p> 
<p> Bread is a good example. Calcium propionate is added to bread-stuff to 
inhibit molding. That's fine. But then the bread is encased in plastic to hold 
in moisture and keep it &quot;fresh&quot;. The moisture acts to incubate mold 
spores and overwhelms the inhibitor. Vinegar is used instead of calcium 
propionate in some breads but, again, the plastic ruins its effectiveness.</p> 
<p> Another good mold inhibitor is lime water. This is used in making 
tortillas. None of the old fashioned tortillas (made with just corn, water, 
lime) that I tested had any mold, even without propionate added! Other 
tortillas made of flour and calcium propionate frequently had molds.</p> 
<pre> Figure 47: This Mexican bread had no molds. It is made from white 
unbleached flour and is not wrapped in plastic.</pre> 
<p> Bread is such a staple we must correct its mold problem immediately. The 
two likely sources for the mold spores are: in the flour to begin with, or just 
flying about the bakery and landing on the newly baked loaves. Bread flour in 
the grocery store is quite free of mold spores, so maybe it is the bakery that 
needs to change. Perhaps it is not possible to bake 24 hours a day in the same 
building, year after year, without bits of flour and moisture accumulating in 
the millions of tiny cracks and crevices that all buildings have and 
germinating mold. Yet bread from small neighborhood bakeries does not have mold!
</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Only buy fresh bread not 
wrapped in plastic. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> As soon as you feel a cold coming, ask yourself: what did you eat recently 
that might have been moldy? Cold cereal, hot cereal, bread, crackers, cookies, 
rice, other grains, fresh fruit, store bought fruit juice, nuts, syrups, pasta, 
honey? This takes up a large part of any person's diet, even in a single meal. 
The answer is yes, no doubt you ate moldy food recently.</p> 
<p> So you can't catch a cold directly from some sneezy companion, or E. coli, 
or tapeworm stages, or mites. You have to eat moldy food first. This lowers 
your immunity, allowing any Adenovirus to invade your weakest tissues. If that 
happens to be your respiratory system, you get classic symptoms. (Those same 
&quot;cold&quot; symptoms can be caused by bacteria, for which I have 
preliminary evidence of arriving in a similar fashion.)</p> 
<p> As fascinating as this whole story is, the bottom line is: how can you 
stop a cold, in record time?</p> 
<h2> The Cure </h2> 
<p> Remember, zapping does not kill your cells. So anything hiding in them 
will not be harmed by the electric current either. Viruses live inside your 
cells while they reproduce. You can only kill the outsiders: those stuck in 
your cell gateways. The rest will be killed by your own cells in time. Not much 
time. Five or six hours at most. Your cells do it with mucous secretion, 
inflammation and other unknown ways. So zapping is an imperfect solution.</p> 
<p> Using a frequency generator to electrocute Adenovirus (393 KHz for three 
minutes) is not effective either because you are not killing the mites and 
tapeworm stages at the same time, and the Adenoviruses are coming from them.</p>
<p> The best advice to stop a cold is to: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Eat sterile food for 24 hours. Follow the Mold Free Diet on page 365. Do 
not eat one questionable item.</li> 
<li> Take vitamin C (10 grams or 2 tsp.), a B50 complex (2 tablets), and 
niacinamide (3 500 mg tablets) to help detoxify the mycotoxins already in you. 
See the Sources chapter. It will still take five or six hours for your white 
blood cells to recover their ability to capture viruses, for the 
&quot;gag&quot; to wear off.</li> 
<li> Zap for seven minutes, killing all viruses, tapeworm stages and mites 
together. Wait twenty minutes to let viruses and bacteria in the dead larger 
parasites emerge. Zap a second time for seven minutes to kill those viruses and 
bacteria. Wait twenty minutes to let any viruses infecting the killed bacteria 
emerge. Zap a third time for seven minutes to kill the last viruses.</li> 
<li> Now you need only wait for your tissues to decongest and stop making 
mucous, etc.</li> 
<li> Immediately start the Bowel Program (page 546) in case yours is an E. 
coli cold. You can't, and wouldn't want to, kill all the bacteria in your 
bowel. Zapping kills the escapees, though, to give a bit of relief, and the 
Bowel Program stops the invasive E. coli.</li> 
<li> Do additional zapping as time permits until the Bowel Program has stemmed 
the invasion.</li> </ol> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++In five or six hours your cold 
could be gone. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Of all these measures, stopping mold consumption is the most important. If 
you eat peanut butter now, your cold will return with a vengeance. If you eat 
cheese it will add Salmonella to your illness and you may develop a fever. Your 
own immune system is the most powerful cold killer, so stop handicapping it.</p>
<p> Test yourself for the presence of molds to see if you are accomplishing 
your goal. The various molds I have tested had these emitting frequencies: 77, 
88, 100, 126, 133, 177, 181, 188, 232, 242, 277, 288, 295 KHz.</p> 
<p> In about five hours, some relief will be felt. The time it takes depends 
on how much mold you ate. But if you stop immediately and eat only perfectly 
safe food, your illness will be over in the shortest time. Shorter than merely 
zapping.</p> 
<h2> Mold Free Diet </h2> 
<p> Stick to this for 24 hours, even if you feel better much sooner. </p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Before starting to cook 
sterilize your kitchen sponge +++(microwave it for three minutes), and wash 
hands. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<pre> Breakfast - 1 or 2 eggs any style. The egg carton and egg exterior have 
Salmonella on them, so remove the eggs, replace the carton, wash the exterior 
of the eggs and then your hands again before cracking them. You don't want a 
Salmonella infection added to your cold. - Hash brown potatoes. - Pancakes or 
waffles with artificial maple syrup made with brown sugar and vitamin C. - 1 
cup herb tea with vitamin C, cinnamon, or other spice. - Water with a tsp. of 
vinegar and honey. Lunch - Soup without noodles, without rice or any grain 
product. - Homemade biscuits or bakery bread with butter. - Homemade pudding or 
custard, all ingredients well cooked. Supper - Well cooked fish or seafood 
(canned O.K., like sardines, salmon and tuna). - Fresh green vegetables, in 
perfect condition. - Cooked vegetables with olive oil and salt (pure, see the 
Sources chapter). - Canned beans, any variety. - Baked or boiled potato (don't 
eat skin) with olive oil and salt as described on page 310. - Hot water with 
whipping cream and cinnamon. - A perfectly unblemished banana. - Water with 
lemon.</pre> 
<p> You can &quot;mix and match&quot; these safe foods. If you get a hefty 
dose of mold at the outset of your cold, the toxicity lasts quite a long time. 
Repeat the diet the next day and the next until you are well. In animal 
experiments reported by scientists, toxicity from mold usually lasted three 
weeks. Sometimes the real damage was only seen after three weeks! Keep up your 
vigilance. When you decide to take some risks, make sure vitamin C has been 
added to the new food and mixed with it thoroughly.</p> 
<pre> Figure 48: Goods baked in a panaderia (Mexican style bakery) never 
tested positive to molds.</pre> 
<h2> Prevention </h2> 
<p> What is the best way to prevent a cold? Stop eating moldy food. We were 
never meant to eat rotting, spoiling food. We were meant to be repelled by the 
bad odor, the bad appearance, the bad taste. Our parents were supposed to teach 
us in childhood to distinguish between good and bad food. This system no longer 
works. By mixing spoiled food with good food, by adding flavors and changing 
the food consistency, parents can't distinguish substandard foods, nor teach 
their children to.</p> 
<p> We rely on government agency assurances, like beef grades, expiration 
dates, approved food colors and additives. And when they fail? We land in a 
debacle such as the present one, where large segments of society are ill with 
uncontrollable behavior (called crime), suffer from hormone imbalances and 
sexual disturbances, are sidelined by chronic fatigue and new illness. But the 
greatest social disaster is lowered immunity - AIDS.</p> 
<p> We cannot individually control the destiny of our species. But we can get 
ourselves out of the path of the falling human tide. We can dissent. We can say 
NO to rotten moldy food.</p> 
<p> What about exposure to a cold? Won't you catch one if you're in a roomful 
of coughing, sneezing people? Or you shake hands with a coughing, sneezing 
person? Or you drink from the same glass as a person with a cold? Or your child 
plays with the same toys as sick children?</p> 
<p> Yes, you will catch the virus, but you won't get sick. If you are tracking 
Adenovirus using the electronic techniques in this book, you will see that it 
infects you immediately after eating coughed-on food. It stays in you about 
twenty minutes. Then it disappears, evidently eaten up by your white blood 
cells, provided there is no mold toxin in you. But if you do have a mold toxin 
in you, the virus spreads, multiplies and gives you a cold! I have only 
followed Adenovirus behavior. There are numerous other &quot;cold bugs&quot; 
left for you to track. Each illness in your family could provide you with a 
specimen to research.</p> 
<p> This throws light on self infection, too. When we cough into our hands and 
then eat with them, we self-infect. But it only makes us sicker if we harbor 
molds.</p> 
<h2> Curing Symptoms </h2> 
<p> Cold symptoms alone can be cured much faster than the cold. Taking drugs 
proves that. Most of the drugs on the market can cure some symptoms in less 
than one hour. But not without a price, such as a harmful side effect.</p> 
<p> Homeopathy can cure cold symptoms too, without side effects. There are 
three or four favorite homeopathic remedies for colds and eight or nine less 
common ones. To use them you read the symptoms listed and take the remedy with 
the closest match.</p> 
<pre> Homeopathic Remedy | For These Symptoms 
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------- 
Aconitum | early cold with fever, headache, hoarse cough Allium | clear runny 
nose with burning of lips or eyes Arsenicum | sneezing cold, frontal headache, 
tickling cough Belladonna | high fever cold with flushed face, throbbing head 
Kali bi | thick post nasal drip, colored discharge, sinus headache Spongia | 
croupy cough</pre> 
<pre> Figure 49: Starter set of homeopathic remedies. </pre> 
<p> There are lots more remedies with fascinating symptoms to try to match 
with your own. Books suggest that you start with a 6X or a 12X remedy, but 
success is more certain with 30X. Use three remedies simultaneously. If you get 
total relief at some point, stop. If the cold has moved or won't budge, try 
another set of three after an hour. Don't take them within 15 minutes of food 
or anything else. Homeopathy makes very interesting reading.</p> 
<p> Homeopaths say they stimulate the immune system specifically. My results 
show they do much more. They go right to the gateways of your cells and evict 
the tiny parasite, bacteria or virus stuck to the latch and trying to get in. 
Your immune system would be able to gobble them all up if they weren't gagged 
by the food mold you ate.</p> 
<p> Different homeopathic remedies go to different tissues, so you can only 
clear one tissue at a time. If you plan on trying this for yourself, order the 
set of cold remedies listed above (see Sources). The homeopathic method would 
be a beautiful cold cure if it weren't for the mold intrusion.</p> 
<p> Herbs, too, can cure symptoms rather quickly. Elderberry tea mixed with 
peppermint is cited in herbal textbooks and it could probably do a lot if it 
weren't for the mold immunosuppression. If you plan on trying these start with 
a set of thyme, fenugreek, sage (for throat). Since both herbs and homeopathic 
remedies work on the principle of ejection, they could eject each other. Maybe 
the last one to arrive takes over. This is an exciting field for you to explore.
</p> 
<p> Ultimately, the length of time your own white blood cells are bound and 
gagged decides how soon you are really cured of your cold. Remember taking 
vitamin C (10 grams or more) helps detoxify the molds. If you find a recipe 
that works for everybody in less than five hours, be sure to let everybody know.
</p> 
<h2> True Origins Of Viruses </h2> 
<p> Your body can eliminate any virus in a short time, such as hours or days. 
It can even keep up with a steady stream that is coming from tapeworm stages!
</p> 
<p> Let us apply these new insights to several diseases we are familiar with. 
Let us speculate what could really be happening.</p> 
<p> Epstein Barre Virus (EBV) is a mysterious disease because in spite of 
building up antibodies, it attacks repeatedly. I only see EBV if the person 
also has Eurytrema (pancreatic fluke) in the pancreas. When the fluke is gone, 
I no longer find EBV in the white blood cells. This suggests that the virus 
comes from the fluke. As each fluke dies and is finally removed, the body's 
white blood cells can catch up with the viruses and you begin to feel better 
again, which can be as quick as one day. But reinfection with an EBV-carrying 
Eurytrema (plus a wood alcohol containing beverage to allow the fluke to go to 
the pancreas) can spark the next recurrence.</p> 
<p> Shingles is a recurrence of chicken pox. I always find Ascaris in persons 
with shingles! Unfortunately, killing the Ascaris does not cure shingles. 
Herpes Zoster (the shingles/chicken pox virus) is known to hide in nerve cells. 
Perhaps Ascaris facilitates it's release, or simply suppresses the immune 
system in a way that allows it to suddenly multiply.</p> 
<p> Polio was once a scourge. At that time, we can theorize that a new large 
parasite was making its appearance. Was a new animal association taking place 
in the early 1900's? Life was indeed becoming more urban with horse manure on 
all streets. Owning a dog for a house pet was becoming an acceptable lifestyle. 
Could the tapeworms of these animals give us a tapeworm stage that hosts polio 
virus? Many polio sufferers also had migraines. These are caused by 
Strongyloides, a horse threadworm. Does Strongyloides host polio virus?</p> 
<p> The HIV virus infects us during the time the intestinal fluke, 
Fasciolopsis Buskii, is being hosted. Persons test negative to HIV shortly 
after the fluke and its stages are eliminated.</p> 
<p> Coxsackie viruses give us some of our encephalitises. I never see 
Coxsackie viruses without the bacteria, Bacteroides Fragilis, and I never see 
Bacteroides Fragilis without Ascaris (a roundworm.) I conclude that one lives 
inside the other!</p> 
<p> We may be deriving viruses from all the roundworms, flukes, tapeworms and 
bacteria that infect us! It would be a fascinating study, simply to examine 
each of these parasites singly, searching for their viruses with an electron 
microscope. They could also be searched for using immunological methods.</p> 
<p> Fortunately, your health improvement does not need to wait on such 
studies. Your electronic technique can detect them in your body long before you 
are made ill by them. You don't need to know their hosts in order to stop 
hosting them yourself.</p> 
<p> It is a time of great change for this planet as pollution spreads from 
pole to pole. The growth of industrial activity, mining, chemical 
manufacturing, the food &quot;industry&quot;, and personal habits like smoking 
have spread new chemicals to every corner of the globe. The element polonium, 
which is radioactive and in tobacco smoke, is harmful to human lungs, but may 
not be harmful to a small lung parasite, like Pneumocystis Carnii.</p> 
<p> Benzene, which is a solvent and extremely harmful to humans, may not be 
harmful to fluke parasites living within us. Propyl alcohol facilitates the 
intestinal fluke but is toxic to us.</p> 
<p> Parasites are doing abnormal things. Is this because of pollution? </p> 
<p> The tables are gradually being turned against us in favor of our parasites 
and pathogens. Such large changes are called evolutionary. Is the human species 
doomed, or will some of us &quot;adapt&quot;. Will some of us survive to pass 
on our &quot;better&quot; genes to a new population of cancer-resistant, 
AIDS-resistant, Alzheimer's-resistant, etc.-resistant humans? How many of us 
will die trying?</p>

so common! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h1> Body Wisdom and Why Bad Food Tastes Good </h1> 
<p> Don't let yourself eat junk food just because your body craves something 
in it. Try to figure out what it is your body craves. Could it be fat? Could it 
be salt? Could it be starch?</p> 
<h2> Salt </h2> 
<p> If it's salt, you might also love popcorn and other salty food. This 
implicates the adrenal glands. Maybe they're letting too much salt (sodium 
chloride) leave the body through the kidneys. Maybe they're letting too much 
potassium chloride through, too. A diuretic pill could certainly have a similar 
effect.</p> 
<p> Help the adrenal glands do their job of regulating sodium and potassium 
chloride by cleaning them up. Let salt-hunger be your signal to do a kidney 
cleanse (page 549). This will clean adrenals too. Even a slight drop in sodium 
and potassium chloride in the blood (body fluids) can make you too fatigued to 
tie your own shoelaces.</p> 
<p> Remember, when your body craves potato chips, it craves something in the 
potato chips. If you let yourself eat highly salted food while you're giving 
the adrenals a clean up, at least add potassium chloride to your diet. Make 
yourself a mixture of equal parts of sodium chloride and potassium chloride. 
Part of salt hunger is actually potassium hunger. Let your body (your taste) 
decide on the amount of potassium chloride to add. Maybe one part potassium 
chloride to two or three parts sodium chloride is a better mixture for you. 
After mixing, store it in the original containers (re-label them) to prevent 
caking. If you put it in an ordinary salt shaker, it will cake soon. Use a 
shaker with a lid that closes. Fats Maybe you like French fries because of the 
fat. If you deprive yourself of the &quot;good&quot; normal greases that come 
from plant or animal sources which would ordinarily make up 25% of your 
calories, of course you'll crave grease. But what a bad trade it is. Now you 
are getting lab-made (hydrogenated) grease with a non-biological structure, and 
loaded with the carcinogen nickel.</p> 
<p> So if you're body tells you that you need grease, go back to olive oil, 
butter, cheese (baked only), lard, avocados, nuts and nut butters (homemade 
only) and seeds. Humankind has been eating these natural fats long before 
cholesterol was vilified. The key to cholesterol control is not fat avoidance, 
but a liver cleanse! Starch If switching to natural greases doesn't satisfy 
your &quot;fat-tooth&quot;, maybe its the potato in the French fries that your 
body craves. Plain, pure starch. Do you also love bread and pasta (more pure 
starch though very inferior to potatoes)? Pure starch is very easy to digest 
and has a large adsorptive capability for toxins. In fact, if any family member 
should accidentally eat something poisonous, drinking cornstarch will quickly 
mop it up and keep it stuck so it can't enter your tissues. (This doesn't work 
for all poisons.) By craving pure starches, your body could be telling you 
about a need to improve your digestion (liver disorders) or to eat and breathe 
less toxic things.</p> 
<p> Maybe a stomach-full of baby Ascaris is telling you to eat only food that 
doesn't need a lot of acid: &quot;just potatoes, bread and pasta, please, and 
skip the sauce.&quot; Ascaris inhibits acid production by the stomach. This can 
result in an aversion to meat.</p> 
<p> It doesn't take much acid to digest pure starch and get it on its way out 
of the stomach. And out of the stomach means relief: relief of the pressure on 
the diaphragm and liver, heartburn, that too-full feeling, and other digestive 
disturbances Sugar Your body runs on sugar. If you are short on sugar it will 
turn fat into sugar. If you are short on both, it will turn your muscles into 
sugar. However eating more sugar doesn't cure the craving. You have to find out 
why you are so short, in spite of eating it.</p> 
<p> The first thing to try is 1 mg chromium (five 200 mcg tablets, see the 
Sources chapter) per day. If you still crave sugar after a week the problem is 
something else. Perhaps you have pancreatic flukes upsetting your sugar 
regulation. Kill them and go off commercial beverages that may contain wood 
alcohol. Sugar regulation is very complex, but these two approaches help most 
of the time. Dislikes Respect your body's opinion when it says, &quot;No, I 
don't want to eat that.&quot; Our education about nutritive value of food may 
be sound but there are other facts to consider. We should take a lesson from 
nursing babies: when they refuse to nurse, there is something unpalatable in 
the mother's milk. Usually the mother has eaten onions or members of the 
cabbage family. The baby tries it once, and learns to reject it immediately. 
The baby's liver, in its wisdom, does not want the baby to eat what it can't 
properly digest. The mother may feel: &quot;Now, this breast milk is good for 
you and drink it you must, or you shall go hungry.&quot; Unfortunately, this 
works for 2-year-olds and up. They are forced to eat carrots, peas, and other 
vegetables; vegetables that taste terrible, (modern agriculture has ruined the 
flavor). They alone taste the bitterness of PIT, a cyanide-related chemical, 
and very difficult for the liver to metabolize. Broccoli and onions may burn 
the tongue with its sulfur-containing acids. Green beans, onions, garlic, 
eggplant, all have unique chemicals in them. If you or your child are not ready 
to eat them, avoid them carefully, so you don't get a surprise dose of the 
toxic chemical.</p> 
<p> The more mold a child eats, inadvertently, in peanut butter, bread, potato 
chips, syrups, the less capable the liver is of detoxifying foods. This will 
certainly increase the &quot;pickiness&quot; of a child's appetite. If your 
child has too many foods on her or his personal &quot;off list&quot;, let this 
signal you to improve liver function. Stop the barrage of chemicals that comes 
with cold cereals, canned soup, grocery bread, instant cheese dishes, 
artificially flavored gelatin, canned whipped cream, fancy yogurts and cookies 
or chips. Move to a simpler diet, cooked cereal with honey, cinnamon and 
whipping cream (only 4 ingredients), milk (boiled), bakery bread, canned tuna 
or salmon, plain cooked or fried potatoes with butter, and slices of raw 
vegetables and fruit without any sauces, except honey or homemade tomato sauce, 
to dip into.</p> 
<p> It is frustrating to cook &quot;a fine meal&quot; for the family and find 
everybody likes it except Ms. Picky. The good news is that she can usually 
think of something she would rather eat. If it's nutritious, be thankful. If 
it's not say No.</p> 
<p> Adults should hide their junk food, including everything off limits to 
children. Don't &quot;hide&quot; your junk food in the refrigerator and lower 
level cupboards! Treat yourself as well as your child. If a food tastes bad, 
don't eat it. If you crave it, try to understand the message. Outwit The 
Cravings Here are some examples. Suppose you crave these items: - Pickles. They 
supply vinegar and are often loved by persons with little acid in their 
stomachs or a lot of yeast (vinegar is a yeast inhibitor). Start drinking water 
with lemon juice or vinegar and honey. - Bacon. The fat soothes the stomach and 
slows down digestion. Switch to butter and cream, with meals. - Sugar coated 
cereals. Loved by persons with disturbed sugar regulation. Kill parasites, 
avoid wood alcohol, use chromium tablets and a lot of cinnamon. - Crunchy 
munchies. Your jaw and teeth want some work to do. Try salads, an apple, raw 
sunflower seeds (beware of moldy seeds, nuts and dried fruit). - Ice cream. Ice 
cold food stimulates the thyroid; loved by low thyroid persons. Clean up the 
thyroid by doing dental work and liver cleanses. - Caffeine-laced beverages. 
Stimulate many body tissues, raise blood pressure. Loved by low energy people. 
Do a general body and environment cleanup. (There are people who say coffee 
puts them to sleep. Insomnia has better solutions than caffeine, though.) - 
Candy. The more you eat the more you crave because chromium is being used up as 
you eat it and yet it is necessary to utilize more sugar. Give yourself 
chromium (GTF) tablets totalling 1 mg. (1,000 mcg.) a day and watch your sugar 
craving shrink. - Pretzels. You want salt plus crunch. - Potato chips. You want 
salt, grease, starch and crunch. No wonder they are so popular! If your body 
still has its wisdom, or most of it, why can't it detect the mold in peanuts, 
crackers and bread for us? There is a very sound reason. Our food manufacturers 
have gone to great lengths to fool our native senses. Salt and sugar, roasting 
and flavoring, do most of it.</p> 
<p> Your body is accustomed, natively, to interpret sugar, salt, and flavors 
as &quot;good, good, good.&quot; Of course, the mold is &quot;bad, bad, 
bad.&quot; But when you mix them, what is your body to read? The 
&quot;goods&quot; always win; manufacturers don't stop until they do. More 
flavorings are added. The result is that you can be eating rotten moldy food 
without knowing it.</p> 
<p> Food that is predominantly concocted can't be interpreted by your body 
wisdom. You must use your second-best ally, your intelligence.</p> 
<p> How would you interpret these situations, taken from real life: - An 
elderly person can't stand butter, wants and enjoys margarine. - A child 
prefers canned spaghetti for the real thing. - A child wants to eat only 
sweets, everything else must be coaxed down. - A young man needs 
&quot;his&quot; beer to enjoy a cook-out. - A young man with serious mental 
illness drinks half a gallon of &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;(TM) a day. - A child 
wants ketchup on everything. - A pregnant woman puts herself on a pickled pigs 
feet and white bread diet. Back To Normal Body wisdom was not meant to 
substitute for parental teaching. They must both be there. But when there is 
conflict, trust your wisdom. Will you ever get your primitive body wisdom back 
and enjoy vegetables, fruit, simple styles of cooking and baking them? Yes, to 
a considerable extent. You'll hold your nose at all seeds and nuts and most 
flour (they smell so rancid). You'll back away from cookies and cakes, 
especially icing (they taste like you imagine shortening tastes). You'll 
retreat from deep fat fried foods: the dripping grease will just undo the 
appetite. You'll say &quot;No thanks&quot; to canned food and metal cutlery 
(you can taste the metal now). You'd have to force yourself to eat grocery 
bread (it's so doughy and sour smelling). Wheat germ smells terrible 
(rancidity). Even vitamin tablets may smell awful.</p> 
<p> Has life been ruined, now that plain potatoes and butter taste good? Your 
body wisdom has returned. You are the true gourmet. It is as different as corn 
on the cob is from the canned variety. Perhaps you are &quot;spoiled&quot; now 
by eating un-rotten food. Accept the charge with humor and dignity - as long as 
you're not expected to eat any more spoiled, moldy food. Toxic Food Grilled 
food develops benzopyrenes in it that are very toxic.</p> 
<p> In an age of lowered immunity, it makes little sense to deliberately 
poison the food with benzopyrenes. Especially for children, who will be faced 
with new viruses and parasites in their lifetimes. Will they be able to 
overcome them or succumb at middle age? Only the strength of their immune 
system decides this.</p> 
<p> Benzopyrenes must be detoxified using the liver's valuable 
benzene-detoxification system. With so many benzene-polluted items, there is 
hardly enough detoxification capability to get it all taken care of. NAD 
enzymes (the N stands for niacin) come into play too. These are essential for 
alcohol detoxification. If you have consumed alcohol, like a can of beer, NAD 
enzymes must be shared between the alcohol in the beer and the benzene in the 
beer. It takes longer to detoxify both the benzene and alcohol. The time delay 
is a time of lowered immunity and facilitates a growth spurt for parasites and 
pathogens.</p> 
<p> Foods that are raised to very high temperatures, made possible with a 
microwave oven, produce benzopyrenes. Ordinary bread-toasters can do this too! 
Old fashioned toasters had a layer of metal separating the bread from the 
wires. Toasting bread in a frying pan or a stove top surface protects it too. 
But your stove grill, whether electric or flame, will produce benzopyrenes in 
your food unless there is a separating wall between them.</p> 
<p> It does not matter what kind of fuel is used, the benzopyrenes develop due 
to lack of shielding between the food and heat source. A metal wall between 
them absorbs some of the heat.</p> 
<p> Do not burn your food in a microwave oven. Since the temperature may go 
higher than your regular oven, you can produce benzopyrenes. Your regular oven 
is thermostated so that it cannot go higher than it states. Baking and browning 
is never done above 425 degrees F. This is your safety feature. If anything in 
your microwave has turned dark brown or black or has melted plastic, throw it 
out!</p> 
<p> Supplements that help your body to detoxify the benzopyrenes are: 1. 
Niacin or niacinamide. These are NAD-builders. Take 50 mg with each meal. 2. 
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin). Take 50 mg with each meal. For unpolluted vitamins see 
the Sources chapter.</p> 
<p> It would be wise to teach children the habits that maximize their immune 
strength. Avoiding food toxins that are specifically immune-lowering is most 
important. Besides the benzopyrenes, certain mold toxins and solvents do this 
and are found in foods. Moldy Food Everything that's animal or vegetable can 
get moldy. While living things are alive, the mold attackers can be held at 
bay. As soon as they are dead, molding begins. First it molds; then bacterial 
action sets in. This is what makes things biodegradable. It is a precious 
phenomenon. It does away with filth - in an exquisite manner. Without mold and 
decay the streets of New York would still be full of horse manure from the days 
of the horse and buggy and our lakes too full of dead fish to swim in.</p> 
<p> Every grain has its molds; every fruit has its molds; tea and coffee 
plants have their molds; as do all herbs, and vegetables. Nuts have their 
molds; nuts grown in the ground (peanuts) are especially moldy because the 
earth is so full of mold spores. But the wind carries these spores high up into 
trees, and even up to the stratosphere. Molds are not very choosy. They have 
their preference for certain plants and conditions. But the same molds can grow 
on many plants. This is why aflatoxin, for instance, is found not just in your 
cereal, bread and pasta but in nuts, maple syrup, orange juice, vinegar, wine, 
etc. Where is it not? It is not in dairy products or fresh fruit and 
vegetables, provided you wash the outside. It is not in meat, eggs, and fish. 
It is not in water.</p> 
<p> Although I find aflatoxin in commercial bread, I do not find it in 
carefully screened wheat that has had its discolored, shriveled seeds removed 
before using it for making bread, cereals and noodles. It is not in baked goods 
bought at bakeries, left open to air. Evidently the system of wrapping baked 
goods in plastic keeps moisture trapped and starts the molding process. In 
spite of adding mold inhibitors, American bread-stuff is far inferior to 
Mexican baked goods in which I do not find aflatoxin!</p> 
<p> Here is some good news for cooks: if you bake it yourself, adding a bit of 
vitamin C to the dough, your breads will be mold free for an extended period 
(and rise higher). Aflatoxin What is so important about molds? Some of them 
produce very, very toxic chemicals wherever they grow. They produce some of the 
most toxic chemicals known to exist. Aflatoxin is one of these. My tests show 
it is always present in cancer patients; in other words it has built up due to 
the body's inability to detoxify it in a reasonable time. A great deal of 
research has been done on aflatoxin. Any library would have more information.
</p> 
<p> Aflatoxin reaches the liver and simply kills portions of it. After a hefty 
dose the liver is weakened for a long time - possibly years. Hepatitis and 
cirrhosis cases always reveal aflatoxin. The liver fights hard to detoxify 
aflatoxin and manage its own survival. It manages for 2 to 3 weeks; then a 
portion of it succumbs. So the toxic effects of a dose of aflatoxin aren't even 
noticeable for several weeks! And without a taste or smell to guide you, how 
would you know to stop eating the moldy peanut butter or spaghetti? The answer 
is: 1. make and bake things for yourself 2. test the things you dearly love but 
can't make 3. treat things that are treatable for molds 4. throw the rest out 
of your diet Treatments mentioned in the industrial research journals are 
hydrogen peroxide, strong alkali such as lime-water, metabisulfite (a common 
reducing agent) and high heat. I have tried heat and vitamin C, which is also a 
reducing agent.</p> 
<p> Just heating a food to the boiling point does not kill the molds. Boiling 
for many minutes at a higher temperature or baking does kill them (but not 
ergot, another mold) and also destroys aflatoxin they produced and left in the 
food. For foods you can't heat that high, for example nuts that are already 
roasted, or vinegar, vitamin C comes to the rescue. I suppose it acts a lot 
like the bisulfite, chemically destroying the mold toxin molecules. Eradicating 
Aflatoxin Simply sprinkling vitamin C over roasted nuts is not effective 
because the molds have penetrated the surface. Rinse the nuts in water first (a 
lot of mold is removed in this simple way). Cover the nuts with water, add 
about 1/4 tsp. vitamin C powder (for a pint of nuts) and mix. Let stand for 5 
minutes. The water penetrates the nuts, taking the vitamin C with it and 
detoxifies them. Pour off the water and dry the nuts in the oven at low heat. 
(Don't burn them or you will make benzopyrenes.)</p> 
<p> Rice and pastas can be demolded partly by cooking and partly by adding 
vitamin C before or after cooking. There is no need to add so much it affects 
the flavor. Brown rice is especially moldy.</p> 
<p> Vinegars can simply have vitamin C added and placed in the refrigerator. 
</p> 
<p> Honey can be warmed and treated the same way (1/4 tsp. per pint). </p> 
<p> Bread cannot be salvaged. Switch to bakery breads or homemade. Use it up 
in a few days, left in its paper bag. Or slice and place in a plastic bag in 
the freezer.</p> 
<p> Since all foods have both their own and others' molds, there must be 
thousands of molds. Very many have been studied besides aflatoxin producers. 
Zearalenone Zearalenone, an anabolic and uterotrophic metabolite, is frequently 
found in commercial cereal grains and in processed foods and feeds, and is 
often reported as causative agent of naturally occurring hyperestrogenism and 
infertility in swine, poultry and cattle. (Bottalico, A., Lerario, P., and 
Visconti, A., &quot;Production of Zearalenone, Trichothecenes and Moniliformin 
By Fusarium Species From Cereals, In Italy&quot;. From &quot;Toxigenic 
Fungi&quot;, Vol 7, edited by H. Kurata and Y. Ueno, co-published by Kodansha 
Ltd, Tokyo and Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam, 1984, page 199.) 
What this means is, in animals, &quot;zear&quot; looks likes extra estrogen to 
the body. Does it affect humans the same way? Are high estrogen levels a 
problem for us? I find nearly every breast cancer case shows a too-high 
estrogen level for years before the cancer is found! It starts females maturing 
too early, too. It could cause PMS, ovarian cysts and infertility. Not 
everybody gets all of these effects. And what is the effect on men and boys of 
eating an estrogen-like mycotoxin in their daily diet? This female hormone 
could have a drastic effect on the maturing process even in small amounts.</p> 
<p> Zearalenone (&quot;zear&quot;) and aflatoxin both have immune lowering 
effects. Zearalenone can induce thymic atrophy and macrophage activation. 
(Luster, M.l., Boorman, G.A., Korach, K.S., Dieter, M.P., and Hong, L. 1984. 
&quot;Myelotoxicity toxicity resulting from exogenous estrogens evidence for 
bimodal mechanism of action&quot;. From &quot;Int. J. Immunopharmacol&quot;. 
6:287-297.) If you have low immunity (low T-cells, low white blood cell count, 
and so forth), immediately go off moldy food suspects.</p> 
<p> &quot;Zear&quot; is the mycotoxin that prevents you from detoxifying 
benzene. Every AIDS sufferer I see has a crippled ability to detoxify benzene; 
they also have zear!</p> 
<p> The main zear sources I have found so far are popcorn, corn chips, and 
brown rice. But it was absent in fresh corn, canned corn, corn tortillas, and 
white rice, making me wonder how it gets in our processed corn products. 
Sterigmatocystin Sterigmatocystin (&quot;sterig&quot;) is plentiful in pasta. 
Emphasize baked pasta dishes, not boiled. This raises the temperature much 
higher than boiling. Better yet, make your own pasta with a pasta maker. U.S. 
bread flour is quite free of mold; the mold in our pastas must come from using 
inferior quality flour. Always add vitamin C to pasta before or after cooking. 
Figure 50. All U.S. brands of pasta I tested had mold, including health food 
brands like the one shown here (left). No Mexican brands of pasta, like the one 
pictured (right), had any molds. Ergot A food mold that causes strange feelings 
and behavior is ergot. Although laws regulate the amount of ergot allowed in 
foods (Canada allows one ergot grain per 300 grains of #3 or #4 wheat), this is 
not enough protection. Ergotoxins, for example LSD, are active in extremely 
minute (less than a microgram, about one thousandth of a fly speck) quantities. 
They are not destroyed by heat and are especially toxic to children. I found 
traces in cereals, whole grain breads, wines, and honey. It can be detoxified 
by adding vitamin C but takes longer, about 10 minutes. Detoxify all your honey 
as soon as it arrives in your house. Warm it slightly and add vitamin C (1/8 
tsp. per cup). Stir with wood or plastic.</p> 
<p> Ergot toxicity could explain &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; behavior in 
children, commonly attributed to &quot;allergies&quot;. In fact, the mechanism, 
inability by the liver to keep up with detoxification, fits well into the 
&quot;allergic&quot; concept. If your child has undesirable behavior, try going 
off the moldy food suspects for three weeks (cold cereals, nuts and nut 
butters, store bought breads and baked goods, syrups). Substitute cooked 
cereals, bakery breads, potatoes, and honeys. Add vitamin C to honey, pasta and 
cooked cereals. Pancakes and waffles made from scratch would be O.K.</p> 
<p> Combining alcohol with ergot is more toxic than either is alone. Alcohol 
seems to drive the toxin deeper into your tissues. I have found ergot and 
aflatoxin in beer and wine! Perhaps some of the bizarre behavior and speech of 
intoxication is really due to the mold-alcohol combination. By delaying alcohol 
detoxification, the mold could even be responsible for deaths &quot;due 
to&quot; alcoholism. It would be safer to brew your own alcoholic beverages. 
Start with pristine fruit. Or at least add vitamin C (1/8 tsp. per cup) to the 
store bought container you are consuming.</p> 
<p> Older children and adults are quite susceptible to ergot too. If bizarre 
behavior shows up, such as saying mean and cruel things, expressing unusual, 
irrational thoughts, feeling emotionless or unreal, try the same diet changes, 
but put alcoholic beverages, soy sauces and other sauces, and other grain 
derived foods on the &quot;off&quot; list. Try this diet on yourself if you 
have a temper or crying spells or frequent colds! Ergot can make you super 
religious, hearing voices of command or threat. Ergot also causes seizures! 
Figure 51. All cold cereals I tested were full of mold toxins (besides 
solvents), health food varieties were worst. Cytochalasin B Cytochalasin B 
(&quot;cyto B&quot;) is another immune lowering fungus. I find it mostly in 
pasta. It stops cells from dividing. Dead portions of the liver cannot 
regenerate as they otherwise would after a toxic encounter! Kojic Acid Kojic 
acid is a mycotoxin that appears to be responsible for wood alcohol build up. 
In other words, the toxic effect prevents you from detoxifying wood alcohol. 
This leads to pancreas damage, invites pancreatic fluke infestation, and 
typically results in diabetes. I find it in potatoes; don't eat potato skins. 
If you are a potato lover fix your own so you can peel them and remove any gray 
parts. I have also found it in regular coffee. T-2 Toxin T-2 toxin is a mold I 
have found in all cases of high blood pressure and kidney disease. It is 
present on dried peas and beans but it can be detoxified in 5 minutes by adding 
vitamin C to the water they are soaked in. Remember to throw away imperfect 
ones, first. Sorghum Molds Sorghum and millet carry these. Don't buy sorghum 
syrup. Rinse millet in vitamin C water before cooking, or add vitamin C to the 
cooking water.</p> 
<p> These mold toxins cause hemorrhaging, appetite loss, and inability to 
swallow. Elderly people are more easily poisoned than others; their hemorrhages 
show up as strokes and purple blotches on the skin. Patulin Patulin is the 
major fruit mold toxin. It is present in most common fruits if they are 
bruised. It is particularly hazardous since the mold that produces it can 
actually grow in your intestine in patches. At these locations, bowel bacteria, 
E. coli and Shigella, can climb through the colon wall to invade you. These 
bacteria are then free to spread to regions of injury and tumors.</p> 
<p> If you have cancer or bowel disease go off fresh fruit (bananas and lemons 
are OK) for a few weeks. Then choose your fruit meticulously. Peel everything 
so you can see and avoid every bruise. Also take a 2 tsp. dose of Black Walnut 
Hull Tincture Extra Strength. This kills these bowel fungi. But you can 
reinfect with a single soft grape. Mold Avoidance We should be much more 
critical of our food.</p> 
<p> Crackers are notoriously moldy. Never let your child eat crackers. Make 
crisp things in the oven from left over bakery goods. Just sprinkle with 
cinnamon.</p> 
<p> Dried fruits are very moldy. Soak them in vitamin C water. Rinse and bake 
to dry again. Then store in the refrigerator or freezer. When fresh fruit gets 
overripe, don't quickly bake it or preserve it. It's too late.</p> 
<p> Peanut butter (store bought) and other nut butters can't be detoxified by 
adding vitamin C due to the mixing problem, even if you stir it in thoroughly. 
Make your own. Making your own peanut butter is a great adventure (see the 
Recipes chapter). Mix it with home made preserves, honey, marmalade, not very 
homogeneously so the bright colors and individual flavors stand out in 
contrast. Having three or four such spreads in the refrigerator will give your 
children the right perspective on food - homemade is better. Store bought jams 
are sweeter and brighter in color but strangely low in flavor and often 
indistinguishable from each other. Let your children eat the polluted foods 
that friends and restaurants serve (but not rare-cooked meats) so they can 
experience the difference. Their livers are strong enough to detoxify 
occasional small amounts.</p> 
<p> Tea is quite moldy if purchased in bags. Although I used to recommend 
single herb teas (tea mixtures have solvents), I can now only recommend single 
herb teas from fresh sources in bulk (see the Sources chapter). This also gets 
you away from the benzalkonium chloride and possibly other antiseptics in the 
bag itself. When you get them, store them in their original double plastic bag. 
These herbs are so fresh, you'll only need half as much to make a cup of tea. 
Use a bamboo strainer (non metal). Bake the strainer occasionally or put 
through the dishwasher to keep it sterile. Figure 52. Packaged herb tea is 
moldy and polluted with solvents. Get yours in bulk from an herb company. It 
comes as a surprise that pure, genuine maple syrup has the deadly aflatoxin and 
other molds. You can often see mold yourself, as a thin scum on the surface or 
an opaque spot on the inside of the glass after the syrup has stood some time, 
even in the refrigerator. Some mold spores were in it to begin with. Others 
flew in. After some time they grew enough to be visible. In my testing, 
aflatoxin can be cleared with vitamin C but sterig and others need to be 
treated with a high temperature as well. Fortunately, this is easy to do with a 
syrup. Heat to near boiling while in the original jar with the lid removed. 
Keep refrigerated afterwards.</p> 
<p> Artificial maple flavor did not have benzene, propyl alcohol or wood 
alcohol, nor molds. Turbinado sugar had none of these contaminants either. 
Brown sugar had sorghum mold. White sugar had propyl alcohol pollution. You can 
make your own syrup, safely, with artificial flavor and turbinado sugar. Of 
course, you'll be missing the taste and nutritional minerals provided by the 
natural maple product but in a contest between nutritional value and toxicity, 
always choose the safe product.</p> 
<p> The mold in our hot cereals can be spotted. Pick out all dark colored, 
shriveled bits. This represents most of it. Add honey, and salt while it's 
cooking-this raises the boiling temperature and detoxifies more. At the end, 
turn off heat and add a sprinkle of vitamin C powder. Rolled oats never showed 
molds in my testing, although they have their characteristic fungi, too. Don't 
let grains mold on your shelves simply from aging. Nothing should be more than 
six months old. Remember you can't see or smell molds when they begin. Molds 
must have a degree of moisture. As soon as you open a cereal grain, put the 
whole box in a plastic bag to keep moisture out. This keeps out weevils too, so 
you won't have to put the box in the freezer later to kill them.</p> 
<p> Anything that is put in the refrigerator or freezer and then taken out 
develops moisture inside. Store cereals in kitchen cupboards or the freezer. 
Figure 53. Three safe flavorings. No government agency can test for all of 
these mycotoxins in all of our foods. Production and storage methods must be 
better regulated so as to be fail-safe. Simply sending inspectors out to look 
into the bins at grain elevators is not sufficient. Crusts of mold, sometimes 
several feet thick, that form on top of grain bins can be simply shoveled away 
before the inspector arrives. The humidity and temperature of stored grain 
should be regulated, requiring automated controls. This would soon be cost 
effective, too, in terms of reduced spoilage losses and higher quality prices 
earned. I believe that zear, aflatoxin and ergot require special regulations. 
Products that are imported should be subjected to the same tests as ours. Test 
results should be on the label. Getting Away From Grains In view of the many 
molds that are grain-related, and because these cannot be seen or smelled in 
pastas, breads, cold cereals, it would be wise to steer away from grain 
consumption. Always choose potatoes, because it is a vegetable instead of a 
grain, if you have a choice. The potato appears on your plate the way it was 
harvested. Whereas grain was hulled, stored for quite a long time, perhaps 
degerminated (the bran and germ picks up mold the fastest). Then it was mixed 
with assorted chemicals (fumigation, anti-oxidants), each polluted in its own 
way, packaged again and stored again. Grains have a more tortuous history than 
potatoes that simply get sprayed. Figure 54. Don't eat the green on the potato. 
The spray isn't simple, of course. Scrub it off under the tap. If potatoes 
weren't heavily sprayed they'd be sprouting in the stores. The spray 
accumulates in the eyes. Cut away all the eyes. By the time you have done this 
you may as well have peeled them. But no blemish, no cut, no dark spot inside 
may be left for you to eat. Don't buy potatoes that show a tint of green on 
them (the green color is due to scopolamine; it is toxic). Red potatoes have 
different chemistry that doesn't produce the green toxin, buy these often. 
Store potatoes out of the light, to slow down the greening process. They are 
still a nutritious, vitamin C-rich food-provided you don't fry them in 
benzene-polluted, hydrogenated grease!</p> 
<p> Potatoes have their molds but they are nicely visible. And washing and 
peeling does away with them. Old literature advises that potatoes should be 
harvested by moonlight so the green drug isn't produced in the white varieties. 
With modern mechanized harvesting this should pose no problem. But perhaps this 
must await the age of robots. Figure 55. Potato harvest of the future. Pets 
Teach Health Lessons Dogs don't eat hay and cats don't eat fruit. This is not 
simply due to their inability to digest them. Nor to training. Their body 
wisdom guides them. But we can trick them into eating corn and soybeans by 
adding the flavors they like and thereby defeat their wisdom the same way we 
defeat ours. A concoction is made for them that is called &quot;complete 
nutrition&quot; and we feed this meal after meal, day after day, a most 
unnatural situation. The liver is deluged with the same set of pollutants time 
after time and never gets a rest. Humans still obey their body wisdom about 
varying their meals. This gives the liver a chance to catch up with detoxifying 
one pollutant while the new one builds up. If the liver is absolutely unable to 
handle something, you are informed quite quickly with an allergic reaction to 
the food.</p> 
<p> Cats and dogs with their monolithic diet get no opportunity to reject food 
(except by vomiting or starvation). It is not surprising they are getting 
cancer with increasing frequency, a situation where the liver can no longer 
detoxify isopropyl alcohol, a common pollutant in their food.</p> 
<p> Should we go back to the old days and make their food for them? Yes, they 
deserve pure food, they deserve variety. Table scraps would be much less toxic 
for them than their commercial feed. But what if they like and prefer their 
monolithic &quot;scientific&quot;, &quot;complete&quot;, polluted diet? If our 
food was doused with sugar for breakfast, lunch and supper, we wouldn't care 
much about what was under the sugar either. And we'd continue wanting sugar, 
sugar, sugar the way a pet might want its favorite food and nothing else. Such 
is the deception of flavorings.</p> 
<p> All change should be brought about slowly and with kindness for animals 
and humans alike. Learn what makes a good pet diet. Cats and dogs are both meat 
eaters. Cook chicken in a pressure cooker to kill all parasites. Put portions 
in the freezer. Add table scraps, dressed with a little butter, cheese or lard. 
Don't wash the pet dishes with your own - dishwashers don't reach the boiling 
point. Serve fresh water daily. Standing water picks up bacteria. Don't let 
food get more than a day old in the dishes. It picks up molds. Don't feed pets 
at the table, keep them outdoors during mealtime.</p> 
<p> After your pets have stopped eating propyl alcohol polluted food and are 
not getting propyl alcohol in their shampoos, there is no way they can get 
cancer. Whatever cancer they have will clear up by this change in diet and by 
giving them the pet parasite program.</p> 
<p> Now they are back to a natural state and do not host human flukes. What a 
relief it is not to worry about reinfection from your pets.</p> 
<h1> Easy Lifestyle Improvements </h1> 
<p> None of us likes to change a habit. But once it is changed you are back to 
an automatic way of doing something. By selecting wise habits your improved 
lifestyle pays you back for the rest of your life.</p> 
<h2> Living Hand To Mouth </h2> 
<p> Hands do everything. They pick up things from the floor. They handle 
money. They touch other peoples' hands. They clean up bottoms. They touch all 
kinds of door knobs. And then they pick up food to eat. Some people even lick 
their fingers when they're sticky or just to turn a page!</p> 
<p> What is on the hands that you don't want to eat but can't see? Bacteria 
and viruses from coughing and sneezing into your hands! And cysts! Cysts are 
the &quot;eggs&quot; made by parasites. Cysts are so tough not even bleach 
kills them. They hide under our fingernails when we wash our hands. Then we eat 
them along with our food. This is called oral-fecal route. They hatch in the 
stomach and go to the intestine to live.</p> 
<p> To stop reinfecting yourself the little cysts under the nails need to be 
killed. Food grade alcohol solution kills them. Buy Everclear(TM) or Protec 
(potable) alcohol and make a 5% solution (add 1/4 cup of 95% alcohol to a quart 
of water). Keep it in a small pump bottle at the sink. After using the bathroom 
and washing your hands, treat your fingernails with alcohol. Pump alcohol into 
one palm. Put the fingernails of the other hand into it. Scratch a bit. Pour it 
into the other palm and do the remaining fingernails. Rinse. - Don't eat with 
your hands! Use a fork. - Never eat food off the floor! - Always wash hands 
after petting an animal! - Never touch the bottoms of shoes! Keep shoes off 
couch or bed or chair. - Always cough or sneeze into your clothing or a tissue, 
not your hands. - Keep your fingers out of your mouth. Don't lick your fingers 
to turn pages or open plastic bags. Sick persons need a 50% alcohol solution. 
Add l/2 cup 95% alcohol to 1/2 cup cold tap water or buy plain vodka, 80 to 100 
proof. Pour the vodka into the pump bottle. Be careful that nobody tries 
drinking it. If there are teenagers in the house, add a hefty dose of cayenne 
to it.</p> 
<p> Lugol's iodine will also sterilize your hands. However most commercial 
Lugol's is polluted with isopropyl alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to make it from 
scratch for you (there are only two ingredients and water, see the Recipes 
chapter). Then make a solution to wash in (1 tsp. to a quart of water). This 
can stain some things. Do not use &quot;tincture of iodine.&quot; Better 
Laundry Habits Boil your underwear. In long-ago days, all sheets, towels, table 
cloths, and underwear were separated and boiled.</p> 
<p> With the convenience of our electric washing machine, we tend to overlook 
the fact that underwear is always contaminated by fecal matter and urogenital 
secretions and excretions. Mixing these with socks and towels and dishcloths is 
all right if you are going to kill everything anyway. But if you don't kill 
them, as in cold water washes, you are mixing the yeast, parasite eggs, 
bacterial spores, and fungus from underwear with all the other clothing you and 
your family wear. An enlightened system would be to add an antiseptic to the 
wash or rinse cycle. Lime water (calcium hydroxide) or iodine based antiseptics 
seem obviously simple methods to accomplish this. In the absence of this 
protection, use dryer heat to do your sterilizing. Underwear should be dried 
until too hot to handle.</p> 
<p> Bleach can kill a lot, but it doesn't kill Giardia spores and a lot of 
types of fungus. Don't rely on bleaching. Besides, your skin absorbs it from 
clothing, it is quite toxic to you, and can cause mental effects.</p> 
<p> Commercial detergents are polluted with PCBs and have cobalt added. Both 
of these are easily picked up through your skin. Use washing soda and borax in 
the wash cycle. They do not clean quite as well as modern detergents, but there 
is less static cling, eliminating the need to put more chemicals in your dryer. 
For spot removal use homemade bar soap. Better Kitchen Habits Once a day, 
sterilize the sponge or cloth you use to wipe up the table, counter tops and 
sink. This little piece of contaminated cloth is the most infectious thing in 
the house, besides the toilet. It's more dangerous than the toilet because you 
do not suspect it. Sometimes it has a slight odor at first, which may warn you, 
but most pathogens do not have an odor! As we wipe up droplets of milk, we give 
the milk bacteria, Salmonellas and Shigellas, a new home to multiply and thrive 
in. We add crumbs, picking up molds this way. We add dust, picking up parasite 
eggs and stages. They all feed on the milk and food residue.</p> 
<p> As the counter and table and stove get wiped &quot;clean&quot; a film of 
contamination is left everywhere. A few varieties may die but most of them 
don't. The general moisture in the kitchen is enough for them to survive. The 
cloth or sponge recolonizes the kitchen and dining room table several times a 
day.</p> 
<p> No doubt, the last thing you do before leaving the kitchen is squeeze it 
dry with your hands. Now all the pathogens are on your hands!</p> 
<p> Where do your fingers go? To your mouth to remove a hull or bit of 
something from your teeth. Or to eat a last bite of something. Or to turn a 
page of the telephone directory. You have just eaten a culture sampling from 
your own kitchen sponge. In two hours they are already multiplying in the 
greatest culture system of all: your body! You have given yourself your next 
sore throat, or cold or headache. The worst possible habit is to wipe a child's 
face and hands with the kitchen cloth. Or to have a handy towel hanging from 
the refrigerator handle.</p> 
<p> To sterilize the sponge: drop it into a 50% solution of grain alcohol at 
the end of each day. Keep a wide mouth glass quart jar handy just for this. 
Keep the jar tightly closed and out of the reach of children. Dunk your sponge 
and plop it onto the sink. If you stand it on end in the sink it will partly 
dry overnight.</p> 
<p> Another way to sterilize the sponge or cloth is to microwave it, after 
wetting it, for 3 minutes. Any shorter time simply warms and cultures the 
pathogens and multiplies them. Or boil the cloth like our grandparents did. 
Drying out the dish cloth helps kill many-but not all-pathogens. It takes three 
days of drying to kill all! Another strategy is to use a fresh cloth or sponge 
each day, putting the used one to dry until laundry day.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++During the day, set the sponge 
on end to start drying and +++slow down culturing. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> Don't eat food directly off the 
counter top or table top. You wouldn't slice a tomato or egg directly on the 
counter top. It would pick up something: some little particle of dust or dirt. 
Treat bread the same way. Always on a new clean surface, such as a plate. The 
counter and table top have on them whatever is in the kitchen dust and on the 
wipe cloth. Dust is always falling! And the sponge is always culturing. Don't 
eat the dust!
<p> Keep the cutting board sterile like dishes. Wash it the same way and keep 
it in the cupboard.</p> 
<p> Keep food containers closed. Milk or water glasses are picking up dust as 
soon as you set them out. Dust is everywhere. Every step on the carpet sends up 
a puff of dust. Vacuuming sends up a hurricane of dust and distributes bathroom 
dust to the kitchen and kitchen dust to the bedrooms. So if one person has 
brought in a new infection, the whole family is exposed to it in hours via the 
dust.</p> 
<p> It is very helpful not to eat the new infectious pathogen. Breathing it is 
not so damaging. Our noses collect such pathogens and we blow them out again. 
Touching the infected person is not very damaging either; the pathogens can't 
get through our skins and since we wash hands before eating we are not at great 
risk of infection this way. But eating the pathogen is 100% effective in 
infecting us. The new pathogen is in the dust. The newly contaminated dust 
drops into your ready and waiting glasses on the table and the open foods. Of 
course, there is no defense if somebody should cough or sneeze at the table.</p>
<p> Teach children to cough and sneeze into a suitable collecting place like a 
tissue, not their hands. Pathogens live bountifully on hands. Hands not only 
provide moisture but often food from the last meal. Hands are second only to 
the dish cloth in contamination level. If you must cough or sneeze and a tissue 
is not within reach fast enough, use your clothing! That's what clothing is 
for-to protect you. Cough and sneeze into your own clothing; this protects the 
cougher and sneezer, as well as everybody else. A sleeve is handy for children. 
The inside of your T-shirt for T-shirt wearers. The inside of coat for suited 
persons. The inside of the neck line for dresses. Of course, paper is best, but 
in emergency use cloth. Never, never your hands unless you are free to 
immediately dash into the washroom and clean the contamination off your hands.

<p> Teach children this old rearranged verse: If you cough or sneeze or sniff 
Grab a tissue, quick-quick-quick! And if you're sitting at the table Do it in 
your sleeve if able. Better Housekeeping Throw out as much of the wall to wall 
carpeting as you can bear to part with. It is injurious to everyone's health, 
even though it's comforting to bare feet and looks pretty.</p> 
<p> Carpets clean our shoes. Modern shoes, with their deep treads, bring in 
huge amounts of outdoor filth which settles deep down into the carpets. In 
spite of vacuuming every week, the filth accumulates.</p> 
<p> Vacuum the carpets when the children, the sick and elderly are out of the 
house. The dust raised and distributed throughout the house isn't just dirt, 
it's infectious dirt. It lands on tables and counters. These get wiped with a 
cloth or sponge and then applied to dishes. The dust in the kitchen falls on 
open food and into open containers.</p> 
<p> Clean carpets with a &quot;steam cleaner&quot;. When you see how much 
filth is in the water and realize how much dirt you were living with, you might 
be willing to trade in the &quot;beauty&quot; of carpets for the cleaner living 
of smooth floors. Don't add chemicals (commercial cleaning solutions) to the 
steam cleaning machine; these chemicals leave a residue in the carpet which 
dries and flies up into the air to add to the dust. Popular stain resistance 
treatments contain arsenic. Cobalt, which adds &quot;lustre&quot; to carpets, 
causes skin and heart disease after it has built up in your organs. Use borax 
instead of detergent. Use boric acid to leave a residue that kills roaches and 
fleas (but not ants). Add vinegar that leaves a residue to repel ants. Nothing 
controls fleas reliably, except getting rid of the carpets and cloth furniture 
(keep pets out of bedrooms). Removing all the borax is what brings luster to 
the carpet. Use citric acid in the rinse water for this purpose. Adding lemon 
peel to the rinse also adds luster and ant deterrence. Just drop the whole 
lemon in the tank so it can't block the hoses.</p> 
<p> Fleas and other vermin in the carpet simply crawl below the wetness level 
when you wash the carpet. Spraying a grain alcohol solution with lemon peel in 
it (it needs to extract for a half hour) on the damp carpet will reach and kill 
a lot of these, together with the residual bacteria. The damp carpet lets it 
spread evenly and reach all the crevices.</p> 
<p> We are trapped in our dwellings. Primitive peoples were mobile. This got 
them away from accumulations of filth and rubbish in their living space. Much 
living was done outdoors, the cleanest space of all.</p> 
<p> Now, air conditioning has made indoor living more comfortable. But also 
has added new hazards. The strong currents of air blow the dust about 
continuously. Molds and bacteria that grow right on the air conditioning unit 
get blown about for all to inhale. Never, never use fiberglass as a filter or 
to insulate your air conditioner around the sides. It is a carcinogen. And the 
danger of freon escaping from a tiny leak is another major health hazard.</p> 
<p> Forced air heating systems are undesirable, too. All dirt brought into the 
house by shoes gets circulated throughout the house by forced air systems of 
heating or cooling. Old fashioned radiant heat from radiators or a stove did 
not distribute the dust so effectively. A return to linoleum floor covering for 
kitchen and bathroom and hardwood for other rooms would be a good step of 
progress for a health conscious society. Mopping, instead of the vacuum 
cleaner, keeps dirt to a minimum. Throw rugs at doors and bedside, easy to 
clean, would &quot;catch the dirt&quot; as was the original intention. Carpets 
were intended to help keep filth out of the air. These smaller rugs should be 
laundered weekly.</p> 
<p> Furniture should be wood, cane, or plastic, with cushions to soften the 
impact. These can be washed weekly if the covers are removable. Modern cloth 
furniture with its foam interior is a repository of filth and fumes and a 
constant source of infectious dust. Figure 56 Smooth floors allow every bit of 
dust to be removed. Dust your furniture with a damp paper towel. You are 
picking up and removing highly infectious filth (Ascaris and pinworm eggs, pet 
parasites, &quot;dander&quot; and house mites). Instead of distributing these 
from room to room, throw the paper towel away after each room is done. Use 
plain water or vinegar water (50%), not a chemical combination which further 
pollutes the air.</p> 
<p> Clean windows with vinegar water, too. Use a spray bottle. </p> 
<p> Keep your dishes in cupboards. This keeps them free of dust. This 
principle is ancient. It is tempting to leave some of them out. If you must 
keep the juicer or dishes outside of cupboards, keep them covered or placed 
upside down so they don't catch dust. Even inside cupboards, store them upside 
down. When using the &quot;good&quot; dishes or glasses, that haven't been used 
in a while, wash them first. Windows Open Or Closed? In places like Chicago 
where you can smell the air as you approach the city, it is wiser to keep your 
windows shut. You can't breath the industrial &quot;soup&quot; all day and 
night and expect to stay healthy. Of course, it all enters the houses anyway. 
Central air conditioning and a plain carbon filter at the furnace location (see 
the Sources chapter) may be the best solution in spite of blowing dust around 
the house. Keep the vents to the bedrooms closed to reduce the air turbulence 
there but leave the cold air return open. Clean the vents in other rooms each 
week along with floors and carpets by pulling up the grating and reaching down 
the passage as far as possible.</p> 
<p> If you believe the air is free of highway exhaust and industrial smoke 
open the windows every day. This will let some of the indoor toxins blow away. 
Asbestos, fiberglass, freon, radon and plain dust can be reduced to a minimum 
by keeping windows open. If you are ill, sit outdoors (on the porch) as much as 
you can. Escape to a suitable climate that makes this possible.</p> 
<p> Just a few decades ago, many people had summer living quarters that were 
different from winter living quarters. Gone was all the accumulated infectious 
dust of half a year of habitation. Figure 57 Moving into the summer kitchen got 
you away from the accumulation of filth from winter! Don't have a basement 
where you stockpile toxic items. Basements invite mold, mice and radon besides 
toxic things. Fumes travel upward where you live! Keep your toxic things in the 
attic. If there is no attic, store them in the utility room. Close off the 
ventilation between utility room and the rest of your house. If you have none 
of these, perhaps because you live in a senior citizen community or 
condominium, don't keep any toxic things stored anywhere. Don't save any 
leftover paints, solvents or cleaners. Buy such small quantities that you can 
afford to throw it all away when you are done with them.</p> 
<p> Live on op of the earth as was intended by nature. </p> 
<p> Never have a basement room &quot;finished&quot; for actual living space. 
Don't buy a house that has a &quot;lower level&quot; built into the earth. This 
will be the most polluted and dangerous room in your house. If you are ill, 
move out of such a room. There is no way that it can be &quot;cleaned up&quot;. 
Move to the other end of the house and furthest away from an attached garage 
door. What Kind Of Heat The worst is coal. The best is none. Breathing coal 
fumes during the beginning of the industrial age may have brought the new lung 
diseases: tuberculosis (TB), and pneumonia. It may also have worsened alcohol 
addiction (beryllium toxicity). Choose electric heat if possible. Even though 
electricity is based on other fuel consumption, you don't have to breathe those 
fumes directly.</p> 
<p> Wood stoves can be made safe by making sure the chimney works properly. 
Never use a lighter fluid. Don't fill the house with smoke when stoking.</p> 
<p> Minimize your use of fossil fuels in every way you can. Getting Rid of 
Mites We do not tolerate external parasites like bedbugs, lice, ticks, leeches. 
Bedbugs were once a scourge amongst northern Europeans. I remember our parents 
spraying for them (kerosene) in the bedroom. This only &quot;controlled&quot; 
them. What eliminated them was a law against sale of used mattresses. Lice were 
originally &quot;controlled&quot; by frequent washing, louse combs, and ironing 
the seams of clothing. What eliminated them was the cutting of long hair as a 
societal practice. But what about mites? They live with us and other animals.
</p> 
<p> Mites are too tiny to see, tiny enough to ride on a dust particle as if it 
were a magic carpet. They resemble insects. Chiggers are really mites. Mange in 
animals is a mite infestation. Dust mites live on our dander (scales of dead 
skin).</p> 
<p> Get rid of their breeding places: beds, cloth covered chairs and soft 
sofas. Humans leave enough dander behind in these places to support these ultra 
small insects. Cover mattresses with plastic covers. Use throws on easy chairs 
and sofas and wash them often. Never allow a pet into the bedroom or the dust 
will have tapeworm eggs as well as mites. Throw out rugs that have been 
pet-beds. Spray the air with a mist of 50% grain alcohol before vacuuming. If 
you have an illness wear a mask to vacuum. Deep, soft, wall to wall carpets 
compromise an ancient concept: everything should be washable and cleanable, 
without throwing the dirt into the air for humans to inhale. Vacuuming a carpet 
blasts mites and tape eggs into the air. Never shake bedding or rugs where the 
dust will blow back into the house behind you.</p> 
<p> Mites don't bite us but we inhale them as they float in the ever present 
dust in our homes. The mucus in our lungs traps them and in a few days they 
die, only to release a drove of Adenoviruses (common cold virus) in us.</p> 
<h1> Four Cleanups </h1> 
<p> Chronic health problems are not due to exposures of the past. They are 
ongoing. Your body is constantly fighting to remove pollutants. In order to 
stay sick, you must be constantly resupplied! These four cleanups - dental, 
diet, body, home - are aimed at removing parasites and pollutants at their 
source. Only then can your body heal.</p> 
<h2> Dental Cleanup </h2> 
<p> (This section on dentistry was contributed by Frank Jerome, DDS.) </p> 
<p> Dr. Jerome: The philosophy of dental treatment taught in America is that 
teeth are to be saved by whatever means available, using the strongest, most 
long lasting materials. Long-term toxic effects are of little concern. The 
attitude of the majority of dentists is: whatever the American Dental 
Association (ADA) says is OK, they will do.</p> 
<p> A more reasonable philosophy is that there is no tooth worth saving if it 
damages your immune system. Use this as your guideline.</p> 
<p> The reason dentists do not see toxic results is that they do not look or 
ask. If a patient has three mercury amalgam fillings placed in the mouth and a 
week later has a kidney problem, will she call the dentist - or the doctor? 
Will they ever tell the dentist about the kidney problem or tell the doctor 
about the three fillings? A connection will never be made.</p> 
<p> It is common for patients who have had their metal fillings removed to 
have various symptoms go away but, again, they do not tell the dentist. The 
patient has to be asked! Once the patient begins to feel well they take it for 
granted, and don't make the connection, either. If everybody's results were 
instantaneous, there would be no controversy.</p> 
<p> Find an alternative dentist. They have been leading the movement to ban 
mercury from dental supplies. Not only mercury, but all metal needs to be 
banned. If your dentist will not follow the necessary procedures, then you must 
find one that will. The questions to ask when you phone a new dental office are:
</p> 
<pre> 1. Do you place mercury fillings? (The correct answer is NO. If they do, 
they probably don't have enough experience in the use of non-metal composites.) 
2. Do you do root canals? (The correct answer is NO. If they do, they do not 
understand good alternative dentistry.) 3. Do you remove amalgam tattoos? (The 
correct answer is YES. Tattoos are pieces of mercury left in the gum tissue.) 
4. Do you treat cavitations? (The correct answer is YES. By cleaning them.) The 
complete name of cavitations is alveolar cavitational osteopathosis. They are 
holes (cavities) left in the jawbone by an incompletely extracted tooth. A 
properly cleaned socket which is left after an extraction will heal and fill 
with bone. Dentists routinely do NOT clean the socket of tissue remnants or 
infected bone. A dry socket (really an infected socket) is a common result. 
These sockets never fully heal. Thirty years after an extraction, a cavitation 
will still be there. It is a form of osteomyelitis, which means bone infection.
</pre> 
<p> Ninety percent or more of dental offices will not be able to answer ANY of 
the above questions correctly. If you allow the work to be done by a dentist 
who does not understand the importance of the above list, you could end up with 
new problems. Find the right dentist first even if you must travel hundreds of 
miles. There are 6,000 to 10,000 dentists who should be able to help. Some can 
do part of the work and refer you to a specialist for the rest. Five hundred to 
one thousand of these dentists can do it all.</p> 
<p> Normal treatment cost is about $1,000 for replacement of 6 to 8 metal 
fillings including the examination and X-rays. For people with a metal filling 
in every tooth, or for the extraction of all teeth (plus dentures), it may be 
up to $3,000 (or more in some places).</p> 
<p> Remember, the simpler the treatment, the better. If the dentist says that 
he or she can change your metal fillings to plastic but it would be better to 
crown them, say &quot;NO!&quot;</p> 
<h3> Guidelines For A Healthy Mouth </h3> 
<pre> If you have What to do --------------- -------------- Metal fillings 
change to plastic fillings Inlays and onlays change to plastic fillings Crowns 
(all types) change to plastic crowns Bridges change to plastic crowns, partials 
Metal partials change to plastic partials (Flexite(TM)) Pink dentures change to 
clear plastic Porcelain denture teeth change to plastic denture teeth Badly 
damaged teeth become extractions Root canals become extractions Braces and 
implants avoid Cavitations need to be surgically cleaned Temporary crowns use 
plastic Temporary fillings use Duralon(TM) Figure 59. Dental replacements.</pre>
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++The guidelines can be 
summarized as: +++ 1. Remove all metal from the mouth. +++ 2. Remove all 
infected teeth and clean cavitations. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> 
</pre> Dr. Clark: Removing all metal means removing all root canals, metal 
fillings and crowns. Take out all bridge work or partials made of metal and 
never put them back in. But you may feel quite attached to the gold, so ask the 
dentist to give you everything she or he removes. Look at the underside. You 
will be glad you switched.
<p> The top surfaces of tooth fillings are kept glossy by brushing (you 
swallow some of what is removed). Underneath is tarnish and foulness. Ask to 
see your crowns when they are removed.</p> 
<pre> Figure 60. Tops and bottoms of some metal crowns. </pre> 
<p> The stench of the infection under some teeth may be overwhelming as they 
are pulled. Bad breath in the morning is due to such hidden tooth infections, 
not a deficiency of mouthwash!</p> 
<p> All metal must come out, no matter how glossy it looks on the surface. 
Metal does not belong in your body. It is an unnatural chemical. Do this as 
soon as you have found a dentist able to do it. Find a dentist with experience 
and knowledge about this subject. It is more than replacing acknowledged 
culprits like mercury-amalgam fillings. This is metal-free dentistry. Only 
metal-free plastic should be put back in your mouth.</p> 
<p> Dr. Jerome: If your dentist tells you that mercury and other metals will 
not cause any problems, you will not be able to change his or her mind. Seek 
treatment elsewhere!</p> 
<p> Your dentist should do a complete X-ray examination of your mouth. Ask for 
the panoramic X-ray rather than the usual series of 14 to 16 small X-rays 
(called full mouth series). The panoramic X-ray shows the whole mouth including 
the jaws and the sinuses. This lets the dentist see impacted teeth, root 
fragments, bits of mercury buried in the bone and deep infections. Cavitations 
are visible in a panoramic X-ray that may not be seen in a full mouth series.
</p> 
<p> The cost of removing metals should be viewed in the proper light. It took 
years or decades to get into your present condition. When you do a lot of 
dental repair in a short time, it can seem to be costly. Unfortunately, many 
people are in a tight financial position because of the cost of years of 
ineffective treatment, trying to get well.</p> 
<p> Your dentist may recommend crowning teeth to &quot;protect&quot; or 
strengthen them. Unfortunately, the very concept of crowning teeth is flawed. 
First, the enamel is removed from a tooth to prepare for the crown. This is 
permanent and serious damage! Many teeth, up to 20%, may die after being 
crowned and will need to be extracted. For this reason, you should only get 
REPLACEMENT crowns and NO NEW crowns. Your metal crowns can be changed to 
plastic. (Remember, no metal must be left under the crown.)</p> 
<p> If you have many crowns, you should have them all removed as quickly as 
possible. But you should not spend more than two hours in the dentist's chair 
at any one time. That is too much stress for your body.</p> 
<p> Dr. Clark: Don't accept intravenous (IV) treatments during amalgam 
removal. Both IV bags and the supplements used in them are polluted with propyl 
alcohol, benzene, and wood alcohol.</p> 
<p> Dr. Jerome: It is quite all right to have temporary crowns placed on all 
teeth that need them in the first visit. You may then go back and complete 
treatment over the next 6 to 12 months. It is common to find a crowned tooth to 
be very weak and not worth replacing the crown, particularly if you are already 
having a partial made and could include this tooth in it.</p> 
<p> Dr. Clark: We are accustomed to thinking that plastic is metal-free. This 
is wrong. The original dental plastic, methyl methacrylate was metal-free. But 
modern plastic contains metal. The metal is ground up very finely and added to 
the plastic in order to make it harder, give it sheen, color, etc.</p> 
<p> Dr. Jerome: Dentists are not commonly given information on these metals 
used in plastics. The information that comes with dental supplies does not list 
them either. Most dentists never look at a dental materials book after they 
graduate. The ADA, however, has a library full of such information.</p> 
<pre> (Call the American Dental Association at (800) 621-8099 (Illinois (800) 
572-8309, Alaska or Hawaii (800) 621-3291). Members can ask for the Bureau of 
Library Services, non-members ask for Public Information.)</pre> 
<p> Dr. Clark: There are many lanthanide (Rare Earth) metals used in dental 
plastic. Their effects on the body from dentalware have NOT been studied. Yet 
their cancer-promoting ability is known in many cases.</p> 
<pre> (Thulium and ytterbium have been studied for their tumor-seeking 
ability. See page 321 in the book METAL IONS In BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, Vol. 10, 
Carcinogenicity and Metal Ions. Editor Helmut Sigel 1980.)</pre> 
<p> Only metal-free plastic is safe. </p> 
<p> Dr. Jerome: These are the acceptable plastics; they can be procured at any 
dental lab.</p> 
<pre> - Plastic for dentures: Methyl Methacrylate. Available in clear and 
pink. Do not use pink. (The pink color is from mercury or cadmium which is 
added to the plastic.) - Plastic for partial dentures: Flexite(TM). Available 
in clear and pink. Do not use pink. - Plastic for fillings: Composite 
Materials. This is the material that has been used in front teeth for 30 years. 
It has been used in back teeth for 10 years. There are many brands and there 
are new ones being marketed constantly. The new ones are very much superior to 
those used 10 years ago and they will continue to improve. They do, however, 
contain enough barium or zirconium to make them visible on X-rays. There are no 
alternatives available without these metals.</pre> 
<p> Dr. Clark: Composites with barium are not good, but I haven't seen enough 
barium toxicity from fillings at this time to merit advising extraction 
instead. Hopefully, a barium-free variety will become available soon to remove 
this health risk.</p> 
<p> Dr. Jerome: Many people (and dentists too) believe that porcelain is a 
good substitute for plastic. Porcelain is aluminum oxide with other metals 
added to get different colors (shades). The metal DOES come out of the 
porcelain! It has many technical drawbacks as well. Porcelain is not 
recommended. Sometimes the white composite fillings are called porcelain 
fillings but they are not. They also require more tooth structure to be removed.
</p> 
<p> If you have a large bridge, it cannot be replaced with a plastic bridge 
because it isn't strong enough. A large bridge must be replaced with a 
removable partial (Flexite(TM)).</p> 
<p> The methods used to remove metals and infections are technical and 
complicated. See dental information in Sources.</p> 
<p> Dr. Clark: I'd like to thank Dr. Jerome for his contributions to this 
section, and his pioneering work in metal-free dentistry. I hope more dentists 
acquire his techniques.</p> 
<h3> Horrors Of Metal Dentistry </h3> 
<p> Why are highly toxic metals put in materials for our mouths? Because not 
everyone agrees on what is toxic at what level. Just decades ago lead was 
commonly found in paint, and until recently in gasoline. Lead was not less 
toxic then, we were just less informed! The government sets standards of 
toxicity, but those &quot;standards&quot; change as more research is done (and 
more people speak out). You can do better than the government by dropping your 
standard for toxic metals to zero! Simply remove them.</p> 
<p> The debate still rages over mercury amalgam fillings. No one disputes the 
extreme toxicity of mercury compounds and mercury vapor. The ADA feels that 
mercury amalgam fillings are safe because they do not vaporize or form toxic 
compounds to a significant degree. Opponents cite scientific studies that 
implicate mercury amalgams as disease causing. Many dentists advocate mercury 
amalgam fillings simply because they are accepted by the ADA, which they 
believe protects them from malpractice litigation. Why risk your health and 
life on their opinions? Remember everything corrodes and everything seeps, so 
amalgams must too.</p> 
<p> Cadmium is used to make the pink color in dentures! Cadmium is five times 
as toxic as lead, and is strongly linked to high blood pressure.</p> 
<p> Occasionally, thallium and germanium are found together in mercury amalgam 
tooth fillings. Thallium causes leg pain, leg weakness, and paraplegia. If you 
are in a wheelchair without a very reliable diagnosis, have all the metal 
removed from your mouth. Ask the dentist to give you the grindings. Try to have 
them analyzed for thallium using the most sensitive methods available, possibly 
at a research institute or university.</p> 
<p> I was astonished to find thallium in mercury amalgams! It couldn't be put 
there intentionally, look how toxic it is:</p> 
<pre> TEJ500 HR: 3 THALLIUM COMPOUNDS Thallium and its compounds are on the 
Community Right To Know List. THR: Extremely toxic. The lethal dose for a man 
by ingestion is 0.5-1.0 gram. Effects are cumulative and with continuous 
exposure toxicity occurs at much lower levels. Major effects are on the nervous 
system, skin and cardiovascular tract. The peripheral nervous system can be 
severely affected with dying-back of the longest sensory and motor fibers. 
Reproductive organs and the fetus are highly susceptible. Acute poisoning has 
followed the ingestion of toxic quantities of a thallium-bearing depilatory and 
accidental or suicidal ingestion of rat poison. Acute poisoning results in 
swelling of the feet and legs, arthralgia, vomiting, insomnia, hyperesthesia 
and paresthesia [numbness] of the hands and feet, mental confusion, 
polyneuritis with severe pains in the legs and loins, partial paralysis of the 
legs with reaction of degeneration, angina-like pains, nephritis, wasting and 
weakness, and lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. About the 18th day, complete loss 
of the hair on the body and head may occur. Fatal poisoning has been known to 
occur. Recovery requires months and may be incomplete. Industrial poisoning is 
reported to have caused discoloration of the hair (which later falls out), 
joint pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, severe pain in the calves of the legs, 
albuminuria, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis and optic neuritis followed by 
atrophy. Cases of industrial poisoning are rare, however. Thallium is an 
experimental teratogen [used to induce birth defects for study]. When heated to 
decomposition they [sic] emit highly toxic fumes of Tl [thallium]. See also 
THALLIUM and specific compounds. (Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 
7th ed. by N. Irving Sax and Richard J. Lewis Sr., Van NOSTRAND, Reinhold N.Y. 
1989.) Figure 61. Thallium excerpt.</pre> 
<p> Thallium pollution frightens me more than lead, cadmium and mercury 
combined, because it is completely unsuspected. Its last major use, rat poison, 
was banned in the 1970s. Every wheelchair patient I tested was positive for 
thallium! One current use for thallium is in Arctic/Antarctic thermostats. When 
added to mercury the mercury will stay liquid at lower temperatures. Are 
mercury suppliers then providing the dental industry with tainted amalgam?</p> 
<p> The cancer causing or carcinogenic action of metals has been studied for a 
long time, although it doesn't get attention by our regulatory agencies. A 
scientific book on this subject was published in 1980.</p> 
<pre> (The title is Carcinogenicity and Metal Ions. It is volume 10 of a 
series called Metal Ions in Biological Systems, edited by Helmut Sigel. A 
university chemistry library should have this book. It has a fascinating 
chapter on the leukemias by two scientists from the Academy of Sciences of the 
USSR, E. L. Andronikashvili and L. Mosulishvili. Their brilliant work and 
discussion was largely responsible for my pursuit of the whole subject of 
cancer.)</pre> 
<p></p> One table from this book is shown on page 431. We can see that 
chromium and nickel compounds are the most carcinogenic metals. Nickel is used 
in gold crowns, braces, and children's crowns!
<p> Note that the form of the metal is very important. For instance chromium 
is an essential element of glucose tolerance factor, but most of its other 
compounds are extremely toxic. In general, xenobiotic compounds (foreign) are 
to be avoided! Metal doesn't belong in our foods or in our bodies.</p> 
<h3> Dental Rewards </h3> 
<p> After your mouth is metal and infection-free, notice whether your sinus 
condition, ear-ringing, enlarged neck glands, headache, enlarged spleen, 
bloated condition, knee pain, foot pain, hip pain, dizziness, aching bones and 
joints improve. Keep a small notebook to write down these improvements. It will 
show you which symptoms came originally from your teeth. Symptoms often come 
back! So go back to your dentist, to search for a hidden infection under one or 
more of your teeth, or where your teeth once were! That infection can be the 
cause of tinnitus, TMJ, arthritis, neck pain, loss of balance, and heart 
attacks!</p> 
<pre> Figure 62. More dental metal. </pre> 
<p> Dentures can be beautiful. Of course, plastic isn't natural, but it is the 
best compromise that can be made to restore your mouth. At least it isn't 
positively charged like metals; it can't set up an electric current nor a 
magnetic field in your mouth, all of which may be harmful.</p> 
<pre> Figure 63. Beautiful plastic mouth. </pre> 
<p> Do not be swayed by arguments that plastic is not as strong as metal. You 
see dentures everywhere and they seem strong enough to eat with. You will be 
told that &quot;noble&quot; metals like gold and platinum and silver are OK, 
that they are &quot;inert&quot; and do not corrode or seep. Nothing could be 
more untrue. You may be keeping them glossy by the constant polishing action of 
your toothpaste. But if you look at the underside, the view is frightful. 
Everything tarnishes and everything seeps. You wouldn't expect even a gold or 
silver coin that was dropped in a fountain 50 years ago to be intact. As metal 
corrodes your body absorbs it!</p> 
<p> In breast cancer, especially, you find that metals from dentalware have 
dissolved and accumulated in the breast. They will leave the breast if you 
clear them out of your mouth (and diet, body, home). The cysts shrink and are 
simply gone. No need to do surgery!</p> 
<pre> Figure 64. Ugly metal in mouth. </pre> 
<h2> Diet Cleanup </h2> 
<h3> Breakfast </h3> 
<p> Cook your cereal from scratch. Don't eat cold cereal; it has numerous 
solvents and molds. Buy hot cereals that say &quot;no salt added,&quot; like 
cream of wheat, steel cut oats or old fashioned oats, millet, corn meal, cream 
of rice, or Wheatena.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre> (Rolled oats have 235 mcg nickel per serving of 4 ounces, picked up from 
the rollers, according to Food Values 14th ed. by Pennington and Church, 1985. 
I have only found nickel in the &quot;one-minute&quot; or &quot;instant&quot; 
variety of oats, however.)</pre> 
<p> Cook it with milk to add nutritive value. Add your own (non-aluminum) salt 
and a pinch of vitamin C before cooking. Make granola from a recipe (see 
Recipes). Use honey, or brown sugar. Add raisins that were soaked for 5 minutes 
in vitamin C water. Use whipping cream or butter (both boiled) if you need to 
gain weight. Isn't this a delicious way to start your day! Add cinnamon to 
flavor, or frozen fruit and honey.</p> 
<pre> Figure 65. Unpolluted breakfast cereals. </pre> 
<p> Or start your day with fried potatoes, an egg, and glass of milk. Don't 
worry about cholesterol since you will be doing liver cleanses anyway. (We have 
been told that eggs carry Salmonella bacteria. I found Salmonellas only on the 
outside shell and the egg carton-never inside! Could the researchers have 
accidentally transferred the bacteria from the shell to the inside while they 
were testing?)</p> 
<p> The milk should be 2% or more butterfat because the calcium in milk cannot 
be absorbed without at least this much fat. Eat homemade yogurt and add honey 
or homemade preserves yourself. You need 3 cups of a milk product each day. 
Home-made buttermilk is fine. If you don't tolerate milk, and get diarrhea from 
it, try a milk digestant tablet to go with it. Start with only 1/4 CUp at a 
time. Do not choose chocolate milk. There is no substitute for milk; calcium 
tablets are not satisfactory. Vegetable matter, although high in calcium, does 
not give you available calcium either, unless you buy a juicer and make 
vegetable juice out of it. Eating fish can give you a lot of calcium, but it is 
in the tiny bones hidden in the fish. Don't try to remove them. Canned salmon 
has a lot of calcium; tuna does not. On a day that you eat fish, you would not 
need milk. Goat milk is probably better than cows' milk, but more difficult tc 
get used to.</p> 
<h3> Lunch </h3> 
<p> Cook your food from scratch. Don't start with cans or packages or frozen 
items to make some recipe. In fact, don't bother with any fancy recipes. Just 
cook two or three vegetables for lunch and eat them with butter and salt or 
homemade sauces. Bread and milk rounds it out, plus fruit (not canned or 
frozen). Soup is a nice change. Cook it with all the vegetables you can find. 
Don't start with a can or packet or cube. Use a bit of onion and genuine herbs 
to give it zest. Thyme and fenugreek, together, make a flavorful combination 
you can purchase in capsules. Just pull apart and season.</p> 
<p> If all this is too much work, make fresh vegetable juice once a week and 
freeze enough so that you can have a daily nutritious meal just by pouring a 
glass of it, together with bread and yogurt or milk.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Never diet during illness +++ 
+++This is a rule based on common sense. +++A weight-loss diet must wait at 
least two years. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Bake your own bread! I found aflatoxin in commercial bread after just four 
days in my bread box, but none in home-made bread even after two weeks! 
Aflatoxin is a most potent carcinogen and immunosuppressant. Aflatoxin is the 
toxin in your diet that keeps you from clearing propyl alcohol from your body 
(see the &quot;Aflatoxin&quot; section that begins on page 382)! Aflatoxin is a 
substance made by mold; bread starts to mold on the grocery store shelf. Don't 
buy plastic-wrapped bread. Don't ever salvage moldy food, whether it is fruit, 
breads or leftovers in the refrigerator. Throw them out. Buy a bread maker. It 
can do everything, including baking the bread. Use unbleached (unbrominated) 
flour and add 1/2 tsp. vitamin C powder per loaf to help retard mold further 
(it also makes the bread rise higher).</p> 
<h3> Supper </h3> 
<p> Cook your supper from scratch. Emphasize fish for animal food, not beef, 
pork, turkey or chicken. Don't buy bread crumbs, use your own. Don't buy 
batter, make your own. Use genuine eggs, not substitutes. Wash your hands after 
handling raw meat or eggs.</p> 
<p> Make your own salad and salad dressing out of olive oil, fresh lemon juice 
or white distilled vinegar (apple cider vinegar has aflatoxins), honey, salt 
and herbs to flavor. If your digestion isn't strong enough for raw vegetables 
or fruit, make juice. Get a sturdy juicer and make your juice about half carrot 
juice and half from vegetables like celery, squash, lettuce, and broccoli. Make 
your own tomato sauce with pure herb seasoning, not from a jar or can (home 
canned foods are fine, of course, as long as they are not made in a big 
aluminum pot with aluminum-containing salt).</p> 
<p> Cook real potatoes, not instant varieties. Peel them to get rid of Kojic 
acid (mycotoxin) and scopolamine (the green part). Make mashed potatoes from 
scratch, with milk, not box potatoes, nor chips nor French fries. Chips and 
fries were made in chemical grease called &quot;hydrogenated.&quot; There is a 
large amount of nickel in hydrogenated fats.</p> 
<pre> (114 mcg/100 g. Taken from Food Values 14th ed. by Pennington and 
Church, 1985.)</pre> 
<p> Fry your potatoes in butter, lard or olive oil. Find butter that is not 
wrapped in foil and is not salted. Salt your own butter, using aluminum-free 
salt.</p> 
<pre> (Salt has aluminum in it to keep it from caking. Buy salt that has 
magnesium carbonate as its anti-caking agent. Sea salt must be baked for 5 
minutes at 400&oslash;F to destroy molds. Or buy chemically pure salt (see the 
Sources chapter).)</pre> 
<p> Don't wrap potatoes in foil to bake, coat with butter or olive oil. Don't 
eat the peels.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Eat no meat that hasn't been 
cooked as thoroughly as if it were pork. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> 
</pre> 
<p> Other animals are as parasitized as we, full of flukes and worms and 
Schistosomes in every imaginable stage, and if the blood carries these, would 
we not be eating live parasites if we eat animals in the raw state? We have 
been taught to cook thoroughly any pork, fish or seafood. Now we must cook 
thoroughly any beef, chicken or turkey. It must be at cooking temperature (212 
degrees F or 100 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Freezing is not adequate. Canned 
meats are safe from living parasites, but are not recommended due to added 
chemicals.</p> 
<h3> Beverages </h3> 
<p> Drink 6 kinds of beverages: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>milk</li> 
<li>water</li> 
<li>fruit juices</li> 
<li>vegetable juices</li> 
<li>herb teas</li> 
<li>homemade (see the Recipes chapter)</li> </ul> 
<p> This means getting off caffeine. And if you are already fatigued, this 
means you might be even more fatigued for a short time. You might have 
headaches from withdrawal, too. But they will only last 10 days. Mark your 
calendar and count off the days. Take headache medicine, if necessary, but make 
sure it does not contain caffeine. For energy, to replace caffeine, take one 
arginine (500 mg, see the Sources chapter) upon rising in the morning and 
before lunch. Soon you won't need it.</p> 
<p> Cutting down on coffee, decaf, soda pop and powdered drinks won't do. You 
must be completely off. They contain very toxic solvents due to careless, 
unregulated production methods. Much is imported and can't be sufficiently 
regulated.</p> 
<p> Even though grain (drinking) alcohol is the recommended substitute for 
propyl alcohol, that doesn't mean you may safely drink it. It is inadvisable to 
drink any form of alcohol at least until you are fully recovered.</p> 
<pre> 1. Milk: 2% or higher, drink three 8 oz. glasses a day. Alternate 
brands. Buttermilk will do. Homemade yogurt is fine. Goat milk is also fine. 
Start with 1/4 cup and increase gradually, if you are not used to it. If you do 
not drink milk because it gives you more mucous, try to drink milk anyway. If 
you have other reactions, like diarrhea, try milk digestant tablets (available 
at health food stores). Milk is too valuable to avoid: there are many unwanted 
chemicals in most brands of milk, but it is solvent-free, mold-free and very 
nutritious. The only exception should be for serious symptoms, like swelling, 
colitis, flu, or chronic diarrhea. But all milk, whether goat or cow, is 
contaminated with Salmonella and Shigella bacteria as well as fluke parasite 
stages. Cattle are immunized against Salmonella but it does not prevent its 
persistence in the bowel. All these are very harmful. Pasteurization does not 
kill all of them. Only heating to a rolling boil makes milk safe. To do this in 
the easiest way, pour 1 or 2 quarts milk into an enamel double boiler or 
microwavable glass jar. Stay in the kitchen while the heat is on. When the 
bubbles have risen to indicate boiling, turn off the heat. You may throw away 
the &quot;skin&quot;. Pour into glass jar and refrigerate. Another easy way is 
to use a pressure cooker that holds several pint jars of milk. All dairy 
products that have only been pasteurized are still contaminated. 
Ultrapasteurization does not improve matters. Dairy products that cannot be 
sterilized should not be consumed. It may be possible to find sterilized milk 
in paper containers on the store shelf - not in the refrigerator; if it wasn't 
sterile it would go foul in a day! Canned milk has solvent pollution. Powdered 
milk has both solvent and bacterial pollution. 2. Water: 2 pints. Drink one 
pint upon rising in the morning, the other pint in the afternoon sometime. The 
cold water faucet may be bringing you cadmium, copper or lead, but it is safer 
than purchased water, which inevitably has solvents in it. Let it run before 
using it. Filters are rather useless because water pollution comes in surges. A 
single surge of PCB contaminates your filter. All the water you use after this 
surge is now polluted, so you will be getting it chronically, whereas the 
unfiltered water cleans up again after the surge passes. Until you can test 
your own water for solvents, PCBs and metals, no expensive filter is worth the 
investment. An inexpensive pure carbon filter that is replaced every month may 
improve your tap water. Inflexible plastic pitchers fitted with a carbon filter 
pack are available (see the Sources chapter). Never buy filters with silver or 
other chemicals, even if they are just added to the carbon. Keep the filter 
sterile by soaking in diluted grain alcohol weekly. 3. Fruit juice: fresh 
squeezed only. Some stores make it while you wait. If they freeze some of it, 
you could purchase the frozen containers. Bottled fruit juices have traces of 
numerous solvents, as do the frozen concentrates, as do the refrigerated ones, 
don't buy them. You have to see it being made, but watch carefully: I recently 
went to a juice bar where they made everything fresh, before your very eyes. 
And I saw them take the fruit right from the refrigerator and spray it with a 
special wash &quot;to get rid of any pesticides&quot;, then put a special 
detergent on it to clean off the wash! So instead of getting traces of 
pesticide, I got traces of propyl alcohol! (Yes, I took a sample of the wash to 
test.) Another grocery store had a machine that squeezed the oranges while you 
watched. But if you did not watch them filling the jugs, you missed seeing them 
add a tablespoon of concentrate, from a bottle out of sight, to give it better 
flavor. It still qualifies as &quot;Fresh squeezed 100% orange juice,&quot; but 
thanks to that concentrate it now has toluene and xylene in it! Best of all, 
buy a juicer, select completely unbruised fruit, wash with plain water, and 
make your own juice (enough for a week-freeze it in half pint plastic bottles). 
For stronger flavor, leave some of the peel in the juice. 4. Vegetable juice: 
fresh or frozen only. If you or a friend would be willing to make fresh juice, 
this would be much better than purchased juice. Start with carrot juice. Peel 
carrots (don't scrape them, it's too easy to miss small dirt spots) and remove 
all blemishes carefully, then rinse. Drink l/2 glass a day. After you are 
accustomed to this, add other vegetables and greens to the juice to make up 
half of it. Use celery, lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, beet, squash, tomato, 
everything raw that you normally have in your refrigerator. Then drink one 
glass a day. 5. Herb tea: fresh or bulk packaged. Tea bag varieties are moldy. 
Buy a non-metal (bamboo is common) tea strainer. Sweeten with honey or brown 
sugar with vitamin C added. 6. Homemade beverage. If you will miss your coffee 
or decaf, try just plain hot water with boiled whipping cream. Sweeten with 
honey. Please see the Recipes chapter for many more suggestions.</pre> 
<h3> Horrors In Commercial Beverages </h3> 
<p> Commercial beverages are especially toxic due to traces of solvents left 
over from the manufacturing process. There are solvents in decaffeinated 
beverages, herb tea blends (not single herb teas), carbonated drinks, beverages 
with Nutrasweet(TM), flavored coffee, diet and health mixes, and fruit juices, 
even when the label states &quot;not from concentrate&quot; or &quot;fresh from 
the orchard,&quot; or &quot;100% pure.&quot;</p> 
<p> It is allowable to use solvents to clean machinery used in bottling 
(please look again at the &quot;Help Your Family, Too&quot; section that begins 
on page 347)! It is also allowable to use solvents to make spice oleoresins, 
which are used as flavoring.</p> 
<pre> 21 CFR 173.240 (4-1-94 Edition) Isopropyl Alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol may 
be present in the following foods under the conditions specified: (a) In spice 
oleoresins as a residue from the extraction of spice, at a level not to exceed 
50 parts per million. (b) In lemon oil as a residue in production of the oil, 
at a level not to exceed 6 parts per million. (c) [Discusses its use in hops 
extract.]</pre> 
<p> Here is a summary of other solvents mentioned: </p> 
<pre> Solvent Allowable residue Paragraph in spice oleoresins in 21 CFR 
Acetone 30 PPM 173.210 Ethyiene dichloride 30 PPM 173.230 Methyl alcohol 50 PPM 
173.250 Methylene chloride 30 PPM 173.255 Hexane 25 PPM 173.270 
Trichloroethylene 30 PPM 173.290</pre> 
<pre> Figure 66. Lawful uses of solvents in food. </pre> 
<p> I have found all these solvents and others in commercial beverages! Some 
of the solvents I have found are just too toxic to be believed! Yet you can 
build the test apparatus yourself (see the &quot;Making A Syncrometer&quot; 
section that begins on page 457), buy foods at your grocery store, and tabulate 
your own results. I hope you do, and I hope you find that the food in your area 
is cleaner than mine! Remember that the Syncrometer can only determine the 
presence or absence of something, not the concentration. There may only be a 
few parts per billion, but a sick person trying to get well cannot afford any 
solvent intake. For that matter, none of us should tolerate any of these:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acetone in carbonated drinks</li> 
<li>Benzene in store-bought drinking water (including distilled), store-bought 
fruit juice (including health varieties)</li> 
<li>Carbon tetrachloride in store-bought drinking water</li> 
<li>Decane in health foods and beverages</li> 
<li>Hexanes in decafs</li> 
<li>Hexanedione in flavored foods</li> 
<li>Isophorone in flavored foods</li> 
<li>Methyl butyl ketone and Methyl ethyl ketone in flavored foods</li> 
<li>Methylene chloride in fruit juice</li> 
<li>Pentane in decafs</li> 
<li>Propyl alcohol in bottled water, commercial fruit juices, commercial 
beverages.</li> 
<li>Toluene and xylene in carbonated drinks</li> 
<li>Trichloroethane(TCE), TC Ethylene in flavored foods</li> 
<li>Wood alcohol (methanol) in carbonated drinks, diet drinks, herb tea 
blends, store-bought water, infant formula</li> </ul> 
<p> If you allowed a tiny drop of kerosene or carpet cleaning fluid to get 
into your pet's food every day, wouldn't you expect your pet to get sick? Why 
would you not expect to be sick with these solvents in your daily food? I 
imagine these solvents are just tiny amounts, introduced by sterilizing 
equipment, the manufacturing process, and adding flavor or color. Flavors and 
colors for food must be extracted somehow from the leaves or bark or beans from 
which they come. But until safe methods are invented, such food should be 
considered unsafe for human consumption (or pets or livestock!).</p> 
<pre> Figure 67. Some unsafe beverages. </pre> 
<h3> Food Preparation </h3> 
<p> Cook your food in glass, enamel, ceramic or microwavable pots and pans. 
Throw away all metal ware, foil wrap, and metal-capped salt shakers since you 
will never use them again. If you don't plan to fry much (only once a week), 
you might keep the Teflon(TM) or Silverstone(TM) coated fry-pan, otherwise get 
an enamel coated metal pan. Stir and serve food with wood or plastic, not metal 
utensils. If you have recurring urinary tract infections, you should reduce 
your metal contact even further; eat with plastic cutlery. Sturdy decorative 
plastic ware can be found in hardware and camping stores. Don't drink out of 
styrofoam cups (styrene is toxic). Don't eat toast (many toasters spit tungsten 
all over your bread and make benzopyrenes besides). Don't buy things made with 
baking powder (it has aluminum) or baked in aluminum pans. Choose goods made 
with baking soda and sold in paper or microwavable pans. Don't run your 
drinking water through the freezer or fountain or refrigerator. Don't heat your 
water in a coffee maker or tea kettle. Don't use a plastic thermos jug (the 
plastic liner has lanthanides) the inside must be glass. Don't drink from a 
personal water bottle (it begins to breed bacteria) unless you sterilize it 
daily.</p> 
<p> Why are we still using stainless steel cookware when it contains 18% 
chromium and 8% nickel? Because it is rustproof and shiny and we can't see any 
deterioration. But all metal seeps! Throw those metal pots away. Get your 
essential minerals from foods, not cookware.</p> 
<p> Never, never drink or cook with the water from your hot water faucet. If 
you have an electric hot water heater the heating element releases metal. Even 
if you have a gas hot water heater, the heated water leaches metals or glues 
from your pipes. If your kitchen tap is the single lever type, make sure it is 
fully on cold for cooking. Teach children this rule.</p> 
<h3> Food Guidelines </h3> 
<p> It is impossible to remember everything about every food, but in general 
do not buy foods that are highly processed. Here are a few foods; see if you 
can guess whether they should be in your diet or not.</p> 
<pre> breads Yes, but only from a bakery, and never wrapped in plastic. toast 
No. It has benzopyrene and tungsten. Yes, if made on a cookie sheet or in a 
frying pan. cheese Yes, if used in baked dishes. chicken Only if cooked for 20 
minutes at boiling point, as in soup, or canned (never pre pare raw chicken 
yourself). wine with dinner No. peanut butter Yes if you grind it yourself and 
add 1/4 tsp. vitamin C powder as you grind. cottage cheese No, it can't be 
sterilized easily. desserts Yes, but again, only if flavored with safe 
extracts. rice Yes, if vitamin C is added before cooking. Use white only, brown 
is too moldy. pasta Yes, with homemade sauce and vitamin C. Jell-O(TM) No, it 
has artificial flavor and color. egg dishes Yes, but not&quot;imitation&quot;, 
cholesterol-free or cholesteroi-reduced varieties. fish, seafood Yes! soy foods 
(tofu) No. It's the extensive processing that taints it. soup Yes, if seasoned 
only with herbs (no bouillon cube). sugar Yes, turbinado or brown if treated 
with vitamin C. herb tea Yes, if not in a bag and not in a mixture of herbs. 
cheesecake Yes. Figure 68. Some good foods.</pre> 
<p> Choose brands with the shortest list of ingredients. Alternate brands 
every time you shop.</p> 
<pre> Figure 69. All breads I tested had mold if they were in plastic. </pre> 
<h3> Dining Out </h3> 
<p> Restaurants (excluding fast food) are generally quite safe to eat at. Here 
are some do's and don'ts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do carry your own aluminum-free salt and vitamin C powder with you.</li> 
<li>Do ask for plastic cutlery.</li> 
<li>Do drink the water if from the tap.</li> 
<li>Do ask for boiled, not just steamed, milk.</li> 
<li>Don't eat or drink from styrofoam. If getting food &quot;to go,&quot; get 
it in clear plastic containers, or ask them to line the styrofoam container 
with paper or plastic wrap, and line the styrofoam cup with a plastic baggy.
</li> 
<li>Don't use their ketchup and condiments (they have been standing out too 
long).</li> </ul> 
<p> Here is a list of things that are generally safe to order: </p> 
<pre> pancakes, French Don't use their imitation syrup (has toast, waffles 
benzoate), use honey instead. eggs Any style except soft boiled and scrambled. 
The white should be solid. hash browns If lightly fried, not deep fried. soup 
Only if nothing else is available. (It probably came in a can and was cooked in 
an aluminum pot and is full of aluminized salt.) vegetarian sandwiches But no 
soy products (too processed). baked or boiled Use only cheese sauce, bring your 
own salt, potatoes don't eat the skin. cooked vegetables Broccoli, Brussels 
sprouts, beets, corn, squash, and so forth. vegetable salads Don't eat the 
croutons, bacon bits, and anything that doesn't look fresh. vegetarian dishes 
But no soy ingredients and or sauces. Fresh ketchup OK. bread and biscuits 
White only, not toasted, not &quot;cholesterol-free&quot; varieties. fish and 
seafood Anything but deep fried (the oil may have benzene) is fine: baked, 
steamed, fish cakes, seafood cocktails, etc. Mexican food Any of the numerous 
baked dishes. Chinese food Except dishes with tofu or MSG. fruit cup With honey 
and cinnamon. fruit pies, cobblers But not with icecream (every flavor has 
benzene). lemon or lime Indulge yourself. meringue pie</pre> 
<pre> Figure 70. Good restaurant foods. </pre> 
<p> As you see your symptoms disappear, one after another, you will feel the 
magic of healing. Many sick persons have 50 or more symptoms to start out! They 
could fill two sheets of paper, one symptom to each line. It can be quite 
shocking to see a list of all your symptoms.</p> 
<p> Sometimes a new symptom appears as fast as an old one disappears. The 
coincidence makes it tempting to believe that one symptom turns into a 
different one. But it is not so. If a new symptom appears, it is because 
another pathogen has become activated due to a new toxin. Try to identify the 
new item. Stop using any new food, supplement, or body product, even if it is a 
health variety, and see if it goes away.</p> 
<h2> Body Cleanup </h2> 
<p> We are living in a very fortunate time. We are not expected to all look 
alike! The 60's brought us this wonderful freedom. Freedom to dress in a 
variety of styles, use makeup or no makeup, jewelry or no jewelry, any kind of 
hair style, any kind of shoes.</p> 
<p> You will need to go off every cosmetic and body product that you are now 
using. Not a single one can be continued. They are full of titanium, zirconium, 
benzalkonium, bismuth, antimony, barium, strontium, aluminum, tin, chromium, 
not to mention pollution solvents such as benzene and PCBs.</p> 
<pre> (Breast cancer cases show titanium, zirconium, benzalkonium, bismuth and 
antimony accumulation in the breast.) (Barium is described in the Merck Index 
as &quot;Caution: All water or acid soluble barium compounds are 
POISONOUS.&quot; 10th ed. p. 139 1983.) ([Strontium] goes to bones.)</pre> 
<p> Do not use any commercial salves, ointments, lotions, colognes, perfumes, 
massage oils, deodorant, mouthwash, toothpaste, even when touted as 
&quot;herbal&quot; and health-food-type. See the Recipes chapter for homemade 
substitutes.</p> 
<p> People are trying desperately to use less toxic products. They seek health 
for themselves. So they reach for products that just list herbs and other 
natural ingredients. Unfortunately, the buyers are being duped. The Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) requires all body products to have sufficient 
antiseptic in them. Some of these antiseptics are substances you must avoid! 
But you won't see them on the label because manufacturers prefer to use 
quantities below the levels they must disclose. And by using a variety of 
antiseptics in these small amounts they can still meet sterility requirements. 
The only ingredient you might see is &quot;grapefruit seed&quot; or similar 
healthy-sounding natural antiseptic. This is sad for the consumer of health 
food varieties.</p> 
<pre> - I have seen rocks sold as &quot;Aluminum-Free Natural Deodorant&quot;. 
You rub the rock under your arms. It works because the rock is made of 
magnesium-aluminum-silicate. - Men's hair color has lead in it. - Lipstick has 
barium, aluminum, titanium. Eye pencil and shadow have chromium. - Toothpaste 
has benzene, tin, and strontium. - Hair spray has propyl alcohol and PCBs. 
BEWARE! Stop using it today. - Shampoo, even health varieties, has propyl 
alcohol! BEWARE! Stop using it today. - Cigarets have lead, mercury, nickel and 
Tobacco Mosaic virus. - Chewing tobacco has ytterbium.</pre> 
<p> Some of the unnatural chemicals listed are present because of residues in 
the manufacturing process, but others you will actually see listed on the label!
</p> 
<p> Propyl alcohol and wood alcohol are present because the tubing used to 
fill the bottles is sterilized and cleaned with them. Ice cream machines are 
&quot;oiled&quot; with a gel containing petroleum products. This could explain 
why I always find benzene in ice cream.</p> 
<pre> Figure 71. Examples of commercial &quot;food lube&quot;. </pre> 
<p> How can propyl alcohol in shampoo get into your body in significant 
amounts? The skin is more absorbent than we realize, and time and time again I 
see cancer victims who have gone off every body product except their favorite 
shampoo. They harbor propyl alcohol until they make that final sacrifice. It is 
better to switch shampoos than to not need any due to radiation and 
chemotherapy!</p> 
<p> See the Recipes chapter for easy-to-make, natural cosmetics. But you might 
consider just stopping them all. Especially if you're going on vacation.</p> 
<p> Use nothing that you wouldn't use on a new-born baby. This is a permissive 
age. You will be the only one feeling &quot;naked&quot;. Others won't even 
notice. Don't forget advertising is aimed at you, even if other people's eyes 
are not!</p> 
<p> Don't even use soap unless it is homemade soap (see the Recipes chapter) 
or borax straight from the box. Borax was the traditional pioneer soap. It is 
antibacterial and can be made into a solution. It is also a water softener and 
is the main ingredient in nonchlorine bleach. Borax can remove grease, too, and 
some stains.</p> 
<p> But even borax is not natural to your body and it is therefore wise to use 
as little as necessary. See the Recipes chapter for antibacterial borax soap.
</p> 
<pre> Dishes and clothing are primary source of PCBs. Figure 72. Detergents 
with PCBs.</pre> 
<pre> homemade soap, washing soda, pure borax Figure 73. Three safe soaps. 
</pre> 
<pre> - Don't use toothpaste, not even health-food varieties. To clean teeth, 
use plain water or chemically pure baking soda (see the Sources chapter) but 
dissolve it in water first, otherwise it is too abrasive. Or brush with food 
grade hydrogen peroxide, not the regular variety (see the Sources chapter). 
Don't use floss; use 2 or 4-pound monofilament fish line. Floss has mercury 
antiseptics (with thallium pollution!). Throw away your old toothbrush - 
solvents don't wash away. - Don't use mouthwash. Use saltwater (aluminum-free 
salt) or food grade hydrogen peroxide (just a few drops in water). - Don't use 
hair spray. - Don't use massage oils of any kind. Use olive oil. - Don't use 
bath oil. Take showers, not baths, if you are strong enough to stand. Showers 
are cleaner. - Don't use perfumes or colognes. - Don't use commercial lotions 
or personal lubricants.</pre> 
<h3> Stop Using Supplements </h3> 
<p> Stop using your vitamin supplements. They, too, are heavily polluted. This 
is the saddest, most tragic part of your instructions. I have found solvents, 
heavy metals and lanthanides in 90% or more of the popular vitamin and mineral 
capsules and tablets I test. These substances will do more harm in the long run 
than the supplement can make up for in benefits.</p> 
<pre> The capsule in the foreground is a notorious tryptophane capsule. It had 
the following pollutants: PCBs, mercury, ruthenium, thulium, strontium, 
praseodymium, aluminum, benzalkonium. Figure 74. Some polluted supplements.
</pre> 
<p> All the Ester-C(TM) varieties of vitamin C that I have tested are polluted 
with thulium! Until all vitamins and minerals and other food supplements have 
been analyzed for pollutants, after they are encapsulated or tableted, they are 
not safe. We need more disclosure on our products. No manufactured product is 
pure. We can't expect that. But at least we should be able to tell what 
impurities we are getting, and how much.</p> 
<p> It is possible to do detailed analysis of foods or products at a 
reasonable price. Look at the bottle of common table salt, sodium chloride, 
that is used by beginning chemistry students to do experiments. It must be 
thoroughly analyzed for them because minute impurities affect their results. 
(Those minute impurities, like lead, affect you, too.) Look at the label on the 
bottle in the picture. Even after all these tests, the cost of laboratory salt 
is only $2.80 per pound.</p> 
<pre> (You will pay about $8.00 per pound (Spectrum Chemical Co.) for USP 
(United States Pharmaceutical) grade. But the same analysis is done on the 
cheaper grades, and my point is that the analysis is cost effective enough that 
it should be done on our daily foods.)</pre> 
<p> It is most important not to be fooled by ingredient claims, like 
&quot;made from organically grown vegetables&quot;. Sure that's great, but the 
analysis I trust would be done on the final, cleaned, cooked and packaged 
product on the shelf. The package is a major unlisted ingredient.</p> 
<p> Toxic solvents like decane, hexane, carbon tetrachloride and benzene will 
get more flavor or fat or cholesterol out of things than metabolizable grain 
alcohol. Of course, the extraction process calls for washing out the solvent 
later. But it can't all be washed out, and a detailed analysis on the final 
product would give the public the information they need to make informed 
choices.</p>

<h3> Safe Supplements </h3> 
<p> There are, no doubt, lots of safe supplements to be had. The problem is 
knowing which they are. The nature of pollution is such that one bottle might 
be safe, while another of the same brand is not. In view of this, as I found a 
polluted bottle, I stopped using any more of that brand. That is why I am 
reduced to recommending only the ones in the Sources at this time.</p> 
<pre> Common salt for student use is thoroughly analyzed for pollution. The 
label gives you the final &quot;Actual Lot Analysis&quot; of the product. It is 
not expensive. Figure 76. Laboratory salt label.</pre> 
<p> Vitamin C, in crystal form, is a must in your lifestyle. It helps the 
liver, and possibly other organs, detoxify things. It also helps retard mold, 
and perhaps even destroys aflatoxins! Keep some next to your refrigerator so it 
is handy when you put away groceries. Add 1/8 tsp. to maple syrup, vinegar, 
cooked cereal, fruit juice, leftovers. Have 1/4 tsp. (1 gram) with each meal.
</p> 
<p> Vitamin B2, 100 mg. This is the vitamin that helps detoxify benzene! Take 
one to three a day. While recovering from AIDS you need 3 tablets three times a 
day.</p> 
<p> Vitamin B6, 250 mg, and B-complex, 50 mg. Undoubtedly these help the liver 
and kidneys in many ways. One a day.</p> 
<p> Magnesium oxide, 300 mg., is another must. Take one or two a day. It is a 
major mineral; all of our cells need lots of it. Only leafy vegetables provide 
it.</p> 
<p> Hydrogen peroxide, food grade. It is advantageous to kill bacteria and 
viruses to some extent every day. Hydrogen peroxide lets you do this. It should 
never come in contact with metal, including its container or metal tooth 
fillings. If you get a few drops on your skin it may turn white and sting, but 
does no harm, so simply wash it off. Instructions for its use come with the 
product.</p> 
<p> Herbs. These are excellent supplements, both in bulk and capsules, but not 
extracts, concentrates, or concoctions. There are many books that describe 
their uses.</p> 
<p> Thioctic acid or lipoic acid. Presumably this chelates (traps and prepares 
for elimination) heavy metals, and helps the liver in detoxifying obscure and 
deadly poisons. Everyone would benefit from 100 mg. per day. I find it 
outstanding, and give it to many ill persons, even when not mentioned in the 
case histories. It comes as a 100 mg. capsule (see the Sources chapter). I use 
it at doses from one capsule, 3 times a day, to 2 capsules, 5 times a day. I 
have seen no side effects at these dosages, even in very sick persons.</p> 
<p> Lugol's Iodine Solution (see the Recipes chapter) is old-fashioned 
&quot;iodine&quot;. Iodine has a distinctive trait: it hangs up on anything and 
everything. In fact, it attaches itself so quickly we consider everything it 
touches as &quot;stained.&quot; This is just the property we want to make it 
safe for use. The amount you use is immediately hung up, or attached, to your 
mucous and can not be quickly absorbed into the blood or other organs. It stays 
in the stomach. And for this reason it is so useful for killing vicious 
bacteria like Salmonella.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Do not take Lugol's iodine if 
you know you are allergic to iodine. +++It could be fatal. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Six drops of Lugol's solution can end it all for Salmonella. If you have 
gas and bloating, pour yourself l/2 glass of water. Add 6 drops of Lugol's (not 
more, not less), stir with wood or plastic, and drink all at once. The action 
is noticeable in an hour. Take this dose 4 times a day, after meals and at 
bedtime, for 3 days in a row, then as needed. This eradicates even a stubborn 
case of Salmonella.</p> 
<p> Notice how calming 6 drops of Lugol's can be, soothing a manic stage and 
bringing a peaceful state where anxiety ruled before.</p> 
<p> Lugol's is perfectly safe (if not allergic) to take day after day, when 
needed, because of its peculiar attaching property. It arrives in the stomach, 
reattaches to everything in proximity. Doomed are all Salmonellas; doomed also 
are eggs of parasites that might be in the stomach (cysts).</p> 
<p> Naturally, one would not leave such medicine within the reach of children. 
Also, one would not use anything medicinal, including Lugol's unless there were 
a need, like cancer, AIDS, or bowel disease. When the gas and bloating problem 
has stopped, stop using Lugol's. If one or two doses of Lugol's cures the 
problem, stop. Store it in a perfectly secure place. In the past, 2/3 of a 
teaspoon (60 drops) of Lugol's was the standard dose of iodine given to persons 
with thyroid disease. Six drops is small by comparison.</p> 
<p> Turmeric and fennel are herbs also used as cooking spices. They can 
eradicate invasive E. coli and Shigella bacteria! They are completely harmless, 
and are part of the Bowel Program.</p> 
<p> Other supplements. The concept of supplementing the diet is excellent, but 
the pollution problem makes it prohibitive. Use only supplements and brands 
recommended in the Sources chapter, although the best approach is to test them 
yourself with your Syncrometer. I can't guarantee the brands in Sources will 
stay pure. If in doubt, leave it out.</p> 
<h2> Home Cleanup </h2> 
<p> This is the easiest task because it mostly involves throwing things out. 
Hopefully your family and friends will jump to your assistance.</p> 
<pre> - The basement gets cleaned. - The garage gets cleaned. - Every room in 
the house gets cleaned.</pre> 
<h3> Your Basement </h3> 
<p> To clean your basement, remove all paint, varnish, thinners, brush 
cleaners, and related supplies. Remove all cleaners such as carpet cleaner, 
leather cleaner, rust remover. Remove all chemicals that are in cans, bottles 
or buckets.</p> 
<p> You may keep your laundry supplies: borax, washing soda, white distilled 
vinegar, bleach and homemade soap. You may keep canned goods, tools, items that 
are not chemicals. You may move your chemicals into your garage. Also move any 
car tires and automotive supplies like waxes, oil, transmission fluid, and the 
spare gas can (even if it is empty) into your garage or discard them.</p> 
<p> Seal cracks in the basement and around pipes where they come through the 
wall with black plastic roofing cement. In a few days it will be hard enough to 
caulk with a prettier color. Spread a sheet of plastic over the sewer or sump 
pump.</p> 
<h3> Your Garage </h3> 
<p> Do you have a garage that is a separate building from your home? This is 
the best arrangement. You can move all the basement chemicals into this garage. 
Things that will freeze, such as latex paint, you may as well discard. But if 
your garage is attached, you have a problem. Never, never use your door between 
the garage and house. Walk around the outside. Don't allow this door to be 
used. Tack a sheet of plastic over it to slow down the rate of fume entrance 
into the house. Your house acts like a chimney for the garage. Your house is 
taller and warmer than the garage so garage-air is pulled in and up as the warm 
air in the house rises. See the drawing.</p> 
<pre> Figure 77. Garage fumes. </pre> 
<p> In medieval days, the barn for the animals was attached to the house. We 
think such an arrangement with its penetrating odors is unsavory. But what of 
the gasoline and motor fumes we are getting now due to parked vehicles? These 
are toxic besides! This is even more medieval.</p> 
<p> If your garage is under your house, you cannot keep the pollution from 
entering your home. In this case, leave the cars and lawnmower outside. Remove 
cans of gasoline, solvents, etc. Put up a separate shed for these items.</p> 
<h3> Special Cleanup for Freon (CFCs) </h3> 
<p> Because I consider Freon to be the top health hazard in our home, I 
recommend turning in your refrigerator for a non-CFC variety. Dispose of all 
spare units. Remove window air conditioners or test the dust in your home (see 
the &quot;Testing The Air&quot; section that begins on page 485) for Freon. 
Have your car's air conditioning system checked. Dispose of old pressurized 
cans. Even one whiff is too much. It never leaves the body because the body has 
no detoxification methods for it!</p> 
<p> Only one useful reaction with Freon comes to mind. Freon is thought to be 
responsible for the ozone &quot;hole&quot; at the South Pole. Would Freon react 
with ozone supplied to your body and thereby become biodegradable? Indeed, it 
does! But only if you drink it as ozonated water. Other ozone routes, as 
intravenous or rectal, have not been observed to be as effective.</p> 
<p> If you are following your progress with the Syncrometer, you will see that 
Freon now appears in the liver for the first time. (Before this, it was 
marooned in the parathyroids, thymus, and other organs.) You may also detect a 
feeling like indigestion. You must come to the assistance of your liver. Even 
ozonated Freon is extremely burdensome to the liver.</p> 
<p> A combination of herbs (Liver Herb Drink in the Recipes chapter, page 552) 
rescues the liver from its plight, and prevents the indigestion. After drinking 
liver herbs you will see that the Freon now appears in the kidneys. Yet it is 
marooned there unless you assist them. Take the kidney cleanse to assist the 
kidneys so they can finally excrete the Freon into the urine.</p> 
<p> It's an elaborate detoxifying program and usually takes six to eight weeks 
to get most of the Freon out. Afterward, continue the programs at one fourth 
dosage for half a year.</p> 
<p> Forane is one of the new refrigerants. Although toxic, at least I observe 
it in the liver directly, suggesting that your body is capable of handling it. 
Remember your new refrigerator will still be using a toxic coolant, and it 
would be best to keep it outside or at least vented to the outside.</p> 
<h3> Special Cleanup for Fiberglass </h3> 
<p> Fiberglass insulation has microscopically small bits of glass that are 
free to blow into the air. When house drafts pull it into the air you will 
inhale them. They cut their way through your lungs and organs like millions of 
tiny knives, spreading through your body, since there is no way out for them. 
You smell nothing and feel nothing. This makes it a very sinister poison. Your 
body, though, recognizes these sharp, pointed bits and tries to stop their 
spread by sequestering them in cysts.</p> 
<p> Most solid malignant tumors contain fiberglass or asbestos, another 
glass-like particle. In nearly all cases a hole can be found in the ceiling or 
walls, leading to fiberglass insulated parts of the house. When these holes are 
sealed in an air-tight manner the house air no longer is positive for 
fiberglass. Covering with paneling is not sufficient. Check your dwelling for 
uncovered fiberglass. Repair immediately. Search for small screw holes intended 
for pictures, or electric outlet plates that are missing.</p> 
<p> Also remove fiberglass jackets from water heater and fiberglass filter 
from furnace. Replace with foam or carbon. Best of all, hire a crew to remove 
it all from your home, and replace insulation with blown-in shredded paper or 
other innocuous substance.</p> 
<p> Never build a new house using fiberglass for any purpose. </p> 
<h3> Special Cleanup for Asbestos </h3> 
<p> The biggest source of asbestos is not building materials! It is the 
clothes dryer belt and hair dryer! To be safe, remove the belt from your dryer 
and check to see if it says &quot;Made in USA&quot; on the belt itself. If so, 
it is OK. If not, it is imported, and probably contains asbestos. Exchange it 
for a USA belt (see the Sources chapter).</p> 
<p> Hair dryers, too, may be imported and shed asbestos. It is especially 
hazardous to be aiming a stream of hot asbestos right at your face! If you 
can't find a safe model (see the Sources chapter), or are unsure, don't use 
any. If you have cancer or are ill, no one in the house should use an unsafe 
hair dryer.</p> 
<p> Turn off radiators and electric heaters and cover them with big plastic 
garbage bags, or paint them, or remove them. They give off asbestos if their 
paint is old.</p> 
<h3> Your House </h3> 
<p> To clean the house, start with the bedroom. Remove everything that has any 
smell to it whatever: candles, potpourri, soaps, mending glue, cleaners, repair 
chemicals, felt markers, colognes, perfumes, and especially plug-in air 
&quot;fresheners&quot;. Store them in the garage, not the basement. Since all 
vapor rises, they would come back up if you put them in a downstairs garage or 
basement.</p> 
<p> Do not sleep in a bedroom that is paneled or has wallpaper. They give off 
arsenic and formaldehyde. Either remove them or move your bed to a different 
room. Leave the house while this is being done. If other rooms have paneling or 
wallpaper, close their doors and spend no time in them.</p> 
<p> Next clean the kitchen. Take all cans and bottles of chemicals out from 
under the sink or in a closet. Remove them to the garage. Keep only the borax, 
washing soda, white distilled vinegar and homemade soap. Use these for all 
purposes. For exact amounts to use for dishwasher, dishes, windows, dusting, 
see the Recipes chapter. Remove all cans, bottles, roach and ant killer, moth 
balls, and chemicals that kill insects or mice. These should not be stored 
anywhere. They should be thrown out. Remember to check the crawl space, attic 
and closets for hidden poisons also.</p> 
<p> To keep out mice, walk all around your house, stuffing holes and cracks 
with steel wool. Use old-fashioned mouse traps. For cockroaches and other 
insects (except ants) sprinkle handfuls of boric acid (not borax) under your 
shelf paper, behind sink, stove, refrigerator, under carpets, etc. Use vinegar 
on your kitchen wipe-up cloth to leave a residue that keeps out ants. Do this 
regularly. To wax the floor, get the wax from the garage and put it back there. 
A sick person should not be in the house while house cleaning or floor waxing 
is being done.</p> 
<pre> (Boric acid is available by the pound from farm supply stores and from 
Now Foods. Because it looks like sugar keep it in the garage to prevent 
accidental poisoning.)</pre> 
<p> Remove all cans and bottles of &quot;stuff&quot; from the bathroom. The 
chlorine bleach is stored in the garage. Someone else can bring it in to clean 
the toilet (only). Leave only the borax soap, homemade soap, and grain alcohol 
antiseptic. Toilet paper and tissues should be unfragranced, uncolored. All 
colognes, after shave, anything you can smell must be removed. Family members 
should buy unfragranced products. They should smoke outdoors, blow-dry their 
hair outdoors or in the garage, use nail polish and polish remover outdoors or 
in the garage.</p> 
<p> Do not keep new foam furniture in the house. If it is less than one year 
old, move it into the garage until you are well. It gives off formaldehyde. So 
does new clothing; it is in the sizing. Wash all new clothes before wearing. If 
you have a respiratory illness, move all the clothes in the clothes closet out 
of your bedroom to a different closet.</p> 
<p> Do not use the hot water from an electric hot water heater for cooking or 
drinking. It has tungsten. Do not drink water that sits in glazed crock ware 
(the glaze seeps toxic elements like cadmium) like some water dispensers have. 
Do not buy water from your health food store that runs through a long plastic 
hose from their bulk tank (I always see cesium picked up from flexible clear 
plastic). Also ask them how and when they clean their tank. Best is to observe 
that it is done with non-toxic methods.</p> 
<p> If your house is more than 10 years old, change all the galvanized pipe to 
PVC plastic. Although PVC is a toxic substance, amazingly, the water is free of 
PVC in three weeks! If your house has copper pipes don't wait for cancer or 
schizophrenia to claim a family member. Change all the copper pipe to PVC 
plastic immediately. If the pipes are not accessible, ask a plumber to lay an 
extra line, outside the walls. This is less expensive, too.</p> 
<p> If you have a water softener, bypass it immediately and replace the metal 
pipe on the user side of the softener tank. Softener salts are polluted with 
strontium and chromate; they are also full of aluminum. The salts corrode the 
pipes so the pipes begin to seep cadmium into the water. After changing your 
pipes to plastic, there will be so little iron and hardness left, you may not 
need a softener. If the water comes from a well, consider changing the 
well-pipe to PVC to get rid of iron. While the well is open, have the pump 
checked for PCBs. Call the Health Department to arrange the testing. If you 
must have softening after all this, check into the new magnetic varieties of 
water softener (although they only work well when used with plastic plumbing).
</p> 
<p> The cleanest heat is electric. Go total electric if possible. If you must 
stay with gas, have a furnace repair person check your furnace and look for gas 
leaks before the heating season starts. Don't call the gas company even though 
it is free. The gas company misses 4 out of 5 leaks! The Health Department does 
not miss any; call them! House builders and contractors are also reliable in 
their gas leak detection.</p> 
<h2> Unnatural Chemicals </h2> 
<p> And where I found them... </p> 
<pre> [section omitted because of all the figures] </pre> 
<pre> Figure 78. Our future, unless we act. </pre> 
<h1> Recipes </h1> 
<p> Read old recipe books for the fun and savings of making your own 
nutritious food. Change the recipes to avoid processed ingredients. Here are 
some I found:</p> 
<h2> Beverage Recipes </h2> 
<p> Anything made in your own juicer is fine. Experiment with new combinations 
to create different flavorful fruit and vegetable juices. Consider the luxury 
of preparing gourmet juices which satisfy your own individual palate instead of 
the mass-produced, polluted varieties sold at grocery stores. Remember to wash 
all fruit, including citrus before juicing. This removes the ever-present 
pesticides and common fruit mold.</p> 
<h3> Lemonade </h3> 
<p> 1 cup fresh lemon juice, 1 cup honey, 11/2 quarts water. Bring honey and 
water to a boil if you plan to keep it several days. Then add lemon juice and 
store in the refrigerator.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++All honey and maple syrup 
should have vitamin C added to it as +++soon as it arrives from the 
supermarket. Warm it first; then stir in +++1/4 tsp. per pint. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h3> Fresh Tomato Juice </h3> 
<p> Simmer for 1/2 hour: 12 medium-sized raw, ripe tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, 1 
slice onion, 2 ribs celery with leaves, 1/2 bay leaf, 3 sprigs parsley. Strain 
these ingredients. Season with: 1 tsp. salt (aluminum-free), 1/4 tsp. paprika, 
1/2 tsp. honey. Serve thoroughly chilled. Makes about 4 servings.</p> 
<h3> Fresh Pineapple Juice </h3> 
<p> Peel a pineapple. Remove all soft spots. Cut it into cubes. Extract the 
juice by putting the pineapple through a food grinder or a blender. There will 
be very little pulp. Strain the juice and serve it on ice with sprigs of mint. 
Makes about 1 1/2 cups of juice. Mix the pulp with an equal amount of clover 
honey and use as topping (kept in freezer) for homemade ice cream (below), 
pancakes, or yogurt.</p> 
<h3> Maple Milk Shake </h3> 
<p> For each milk shake, blend or shake together: 1 glass of milk and 2 
tablespoons maple syrup.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Remember, all milk gets 
boiled. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h3> Yankee Drink </h3> 
<p> Mix together 1 gal. water, 3 cups honey, 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice or 
distilled white vinegar, and 1 tsp. ginger.</p> 
<h3> Hot Vanilla Milk </h3> 
<p> Add one inch of vanilla bean and one tsp. honey to a glass of milk and 
bring to a near boil. You may add a pinch of cinnamon or other pure spice. You 
may even use vanilla extract (see Sources).</p> 
<h3> Red Milk </h3> 
<p> Equal parts fresh carrot juice (use a juicer) and sterilized milk. Save 
the carrot pulp for salads and soups.</p> 
<h3> C-Milk </h3> 
<p> Milk can absorb a surprising amount of vitamin C powder without curdling 
or changing its flavor. Try 1/2 tsp. in a glass of cold milk.</p> 
<h3> My Own Soda Pop </h3> 
<p> Excellent for stomach distress. Put 1 tsp. citric acid, 2 tbs. vegetable 
glycerin (see Sources), 2 tbs. honey, and 1 lemon, juiced by hand, into a quart 
jar and fill with cold water. Refrigerate until ready to use. Then add 1 tsp. 
baking soda (chemically pure only, see Sources) and shake a few times, keeping 
the lid tight. Pour over a few ice cubes. Many variations are possible: other 
fruit concentrates, made in the blender, can be used along with some lemon 
juice; for example, 2 blended whole apples (peeled), blended pineapple, orange 
or grapefruit. Always add a bit of lemon to give it zip. You may add a pinch of 
ginger or other pure spice.</p> 
<p> Note: The amount of sodium in 1/2 tsp. baking soda is .476 grams. If you 
have heart disease, high blood pressure, or edema, use potassium bicarbonate 
instead. Ask your doctor what an acceptable amount of sodium or potassium 
bicarbonate is. I would suggest limiting yourself to one glass of soda pop a 
day, even if you do not have heart disease.</p> 
<p> Another Note: the citric acid kills bacteria, while the carbonation brings 
relief.</p> 
<h3> My Own Super C-Pop </h3> 
<p> An excellent way to get lots of vitamin C into a child and relieve stomach 
distress at the same time. Squeeze 1 slice of lemon and 1 whole orange into an 
8 ounce bottle that has a tight lid. Add 1 tsp. vitamin C powder (ascorbic 
acid), 1/4 tsp. citric acid, and 2 tbs. vegetable glycerin (you may also 
experiment with honey for sweetness). Fill the bottle to the top with cold 
water. Then add 1/2 tsp. chemically pure baking soda and close tightly. Shake 
briefly and serve immediately.</p> 
<h3> Half And Half </h3> 
<p> Mix equal parts whipping cream and milk or water. Boil and chill. </p> 
<h3> Buttermilk-C </h3> 
<p> Stir 1 tsp. vitamin C powder into a glass of milk. Add a pinch of 
potassium chloride. Additional seasoning may be pepper and herbs. Stir and 
enjoy.</p> 
<h2> Food Recipes </h2> 
<p> Despite the presence of aflatoxins, benzopyrenes, and solvents in many 
foods, it is possible to have a delicious and safe diet. Many persons need to 
gain weight, and with the emphasis in today's society on losing weight, 
consider yourself lucky in this respect. Help yourself to lots of butter, 
whipping cream, whole milk, avocados, and olive oil. Make your own preserves 
and baked goods, including breads. Remember, when you are recovering from a 
major illness it is essential not to diet to lose weight. You must wait two 
years after you are recovered to try to lose weight.</p> 
<h3> Daily Foods </h3> 
<p> Dairy products should contain at least 2% fat to enable you to absorb the 
calcium in them.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++All milk should be sterilized 
by boiling it for 10 seconds. +++If it makes mucous, you already have a chronic 
respiratory infection. +++Try to clear this up. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Change brands every time you shop to prevent the same pollutants from 
building up in your body.</p> 
<p> If frying or cooking with fat, use only olive oil, butter or lard (the BHT 
and BHA preservatives in lard are OK except for seizure sufferers). Mix them 
for added flavor in your dishes. Never use margarine, Crisco(TM) or other 
hydrogenated fats. Do not cook over flames or grill, even when electric.</p> 
<p> Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Wash them off only with cold tap 
water, not commercial food &quot;wash&quot;. Scrub hard with a stiff bristled 
brush. Then cut away blemishes. Always peel potatoes, apples, and carrots. 
Modern dirt is full of chemicals and is toxic to you.</p> 
<p> Be sure to drink plenty of plain water from your cold faucet throughout 
the day, especially if it is difficult for you to drink it with your meals. If 
you don't like the taste of your own tap water, try to get it from a friend 
with newer plumbing. Use a polyethylene (opaque) water jug from a grocery store 
to transport it. Never drink water that has been run through a water softener 
or copper plumbing or has traveled through a long plastic hose. Don't drink 
water that has stood in a container for a day. Dump it and sterilize the 
container. To further improve flavor and to dechlorinate attach a small faucet 
filter made of carbon only. Or buy a filter pitcher (see Sources). Don't drink 
water that has stood in the filter pitcher very long, either.</p> 
<p> Because commercial cold cereals are very convenient, but have solvents, 
here are two replacements.</p> 
<h3> Two Granolas </h3> 
<pre> 7 cups rolled oats (old fashioned, not quick) 1 tsp. salt 1 cup wheat 
germ (fresh, not defatted) 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, immaculate 
quality 1/2 cup milk (no need to sterilize, it is being baked) 1/2 cup melted 
butter 1 cup raisins, rinsed in vitamin C water</pre> 
<p> Mix dry ingredients together. Mix liquid ingredients and add gradually, 
while tossing until thoroughly mixed. Place in large ungreased pans and bake in 
slow (250 degree) oven. Stir occasionally, baking until brown and dry, usually 
1-2 hours. Store in airtight container in freezer.</p> 
<pre> 6 cups rolled oats 1/2 cup raw wheat germ 1 cup sesame seeds 1 cup 
sunflower seeds (raw, unsalted) 1 tsp. cinnamon 1/2 cup melted butter 1/2 cup 
honey</pre> 
<p> Pre-heat oven to 250 degrees. Toss all ingredients in mixing bowl. Spread 
thinly on a baking sheet and bake 20-25 minutes. Stir often in order to brown 
evenly. When golden, remove and let cool. Makes 12 cups.</p> 
<p> If you would like to add nuts to your granola recipes, rinse them in cold 
tap water first, to which vitamin C powder has been added (1/4 tsp. per pint). 
This removes aflatoxins.</p> 
<h3> Peanut Butter </h3> 
<p> Use fresh unsalted roasted peanuts-they will be white on the first day 
they arrive at the health food store from the distributor. (Ask when they will 
arrive.) Or shell fresh roasted peanuts yourself, throwing away all shriveled 
or darkened nuts. Grind, adding salt and vitamin C (1/4 tsp. per pint) as you 
go. For spreadability, especially for children, grind an equal volume of cold 
butter along with the peanuts. This improves spreadability and digestibility of 
the hard nut particles. This will probably be the most heavenly peanut butter 
your mouth has ever experienced.</p> 
<pre> Figure 87: Light colored, roasted peanuts in the shell had no aflatoxin. 
</pre> 
<h3> Sweetening and Flavoring </h3> 
<p> Brown Sugar. Although I am prejudiced against all sugar from a health 
standpoint, my testing revealed no benzene, propyl alcohol, wood alcohol. 
However it does contain sorghum mold and must be treated with vitamin C to 
detoxify it. Add 1/4 tsp. to a 1 pound package; knead until well mixed.</p> 
<p> Maple syrup. Add vitamin C to newly opened bottle, 1/4 tsp. to retard 
mold. Keep refrigerated and use promptly.</p> 
<p> Flavoring. Use maple, vanilla (both natural and artificial), and any pure 
spice. They are free of molds and solvents.</p> 
<p> Honeys. Get at least 4 flavors for variety: linden blossom, orange 
blossom, plain clover and local or wild flower honey. Add vitamin C to newly 
opened jar to detoxify ergot mold (1/4 tsp. per pint).</p> 
<p> Jams and jellies. They are not safe unless homemade. </p> 
<p> Fruit syrup. Use one package frozen fruit, such as cherries, blueberries 
or raspberries. Let thaw and measure the amount in cups (it might say on the 
package). Add an equal amount of clover honey to the fruit. Also add 1/4 tsp. 
vitamin C powder. Mix it all in a quart canning jar and store in the 
refrigerator. Use this on pancakes, cereal, plain yogurt and homemade ice cream 
too. Use to make your own flavored beverages in a seltzer maker or to make soda 
pop. If you wish to use fresh fruit, bring it to a boil to sterilize. Use it up 
in a few days or boil to sterilize it again.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Note for diabetics: 
+++Diabetics must not use artificial sweeteners. Nor can they +++use all the 
sweeteners listed. Try stevia powder instead. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
</b> </pre> 
<h3> Preserves </h3> 
<p> Keep 3 or 4 kinds on hand, such as peach, pineapple, and pear. Peel and 
chop the fruit. It should not have any bruises. If you use a metal knife, rinse 
the fruit lightly afterwards. Add just enough water to keep the fruit from 
sticking as it is cooked (usually a few tablespoons). Then add an equal amount 
of honey, or to taste and heat again to boiling. Put in sterile jars in 
refrigerator. Make marmalade the same way, slicing the fruit and peel thinly. 
Always add vitamin C powder to a partly used jar to inhibit mold. Never use up 
partly molded fruit by making preserves out of it. Throw it out.</p> 
<h3> C Dressing </h3> 
<pre> 1/2 cup olive oil 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice or white distilled vinegar 1 
tsp. thyme, fenugreek or both (capsules are freshest) 1 tsp. vitamin C powder 
1/2 tsp. brown sugar</pre> 
<p> Combine the ingredients in a clean salad dressing bottle. Shake. 
Refrigerate. The basic recipe is the oil and vinegar in a 2:1 ratio. After 
mixing these, add any pure spice desired. Or add fresh tomato chunks for 
creaminess.</p> 
<h3> Cheese Sauce </h3> 
<p> Add milk to cheese in equal amounts. Gradually heat to boiling while 
stirring. Add more of either to obtain the desired consistency. Boil 10 
seconds. Use immediately.</p> 
<h3> Sour Cream-C </h3> 
<pre> 2 cups heavy whipping cream, previously boiled 1/4 tsp. citric acid 1/4 
tsp. vitamin C powder 1 tsp. fresh onion juice or other seasoning (optional)
</pre> 
<p> Stir until smooth, refrigerate 2 hours. </p> 
<h3> Yogurt </h3> 
<p> Buy a yogurt maker. Be sure and use boiled milk. </p> 
<h3> Soups </h3> 
<p> All home made soups are nutritious and safe, provided you use no processed 
ingredients (like bouillon), or make them in metal pots. Use herbs and 
aluminum-free salt to season. Always add a dash of vitamin C or tomato juice or 
vinegar to draw out calcium from soup bones for you to absorb.</p> 
<h3> Fish and Seafood recipe </h3> 
<p> Any kind of fish or seafood is acceptable, provided it is well-cooked. 
Don't buy food that is already in batter. The simplest way to cook fish is to 
poach it in milk. It can be taken straight from the freezer, rinsed, and placed 
in 1/4 inch of milk (unboiled is fine) in the frying pan. Heat until it is 
cooked. Turn over and repeat. Throw away the milk. Serve with fresh lemon and 
herbs.</p> 
<h3> Baked Apples </h3> 
<p> Peel and core carefully. Remove all bruises (this is where the patulin 
is). Cut in bite-sized pieces, add a minimum of water and cook or bake 
minimally. Add a squirt of lemon juice when done. Serve with cinnamon, whipping 
cream and honey.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Ice creams from the grocery 
store are loaded with benzene and other +++solvents. Fortunately there are ice 
cream makers that do everything +++(no cranking)! Or try our recipe which uses 
a blender. Be +++sure not to add store bought flavors, except vanilla or maple. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h3> 5 Minute Ice Cream </h3> 
<p> (Strawberry) Use 2 half pints of whipping cream, previously boiled, 1 
package of frozen strawberries (about 10 oz.), and l/2 cup clover honey. Pour 
frozen strawberries into blender. Pour whipping cream and honey over them. 
Blend briefly (about 10 seconds), not long enough to make butter! Pour it all 
into a large plastic bowl. Cover with a close fitting plastic bag and place in 
freezer. Prepare it a day ahead. Try using other frozen fruits, such as 
blueberries and cherries. Keep a few berries out of the blender and stir them 
in quickly with a non-metal spoon before setting the bowl in the freezer. There 
are many ice cream recipes to be found in old cook books. Avoid those with raw 
eggs or processed foods as ingredients. You may add nuts if you rinse them in 
vitamin C water.</p>

<h2> Seven Day Sample Menu </h2> 
<p> Because processed foods have many toxins, you must cook as much from 
scratch as possible. So for convenience sake, keep your meals simple in 
preparation. You may want to prepare ahead and refrigerate your dressings and 
toppings. Or you could make a hot soup for dinner, refrigerate, and eat the 
leftovers for lunch. Don't save leftovers more than two days. Make sure they 
are covered. Try baking several potatoes at one time, refrigerate and put them 
in a salad the next night. Variety is the spice of life, so combine the allowed 
foods in the most creative ways you can imagine. And don't forget herbs and 
spices; learn to use them from old cook books.</p>

<h2> Recipes for Natural Body Products </h2> 
<p> You can use just borax (like 20 Mule Team Borax(TM)) and washing soda 
(like Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda(TM)) for all types of cleaning 
including your body, laundry, dishes and your house! You don't need all of 
those products you see in commercials for each special task!</p> 
<p> Even if you have dry skin, difficult hair or some other unique 
requirement, just pure borax will satisfy these needs. A part of every skin 
problem is due to the toxic elements found in the soaps themselves. For 
instance aluminum is commonly added as a &quot;skin moisturizer&quot;. It does 
this by impregnating the skin and attracting water, giving the illusion of 
moist skin. In fact you simply have moist aluminum stuck in your skin which 
your immune system must remove. While borax won't directly heal your skin or 
complexion, it does replace the agents that are causing damage, so that healing 
can occur.</p> 
<h3> Borax Liquid Soap </h3> 
<pre> Empty 1 gallon jug 1/8 cup borax powder Plastic funnel </pre> 
<p> Funnel the borax into the jug, fill with cold tap water. Shake a few 
times. Let settle. In a few minutes you can pour off the clear part into 
dispenser bottles. This is the soap!</p> 
<p> Easier way: use any bottle, pour borax powder to a depth of a 1/2 inch or 
so. Add water. Shake. When you have used it down to the undissolved granules, 
add more water and shake again. Add more borax when the undissolved granules 
get low.</p> 
<p> Keep a dispenser by the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, and shower. It does 
not contain aluminum as regular detergents and soaps do, and which probably 
contribute to Alzheimer's disease. It does not contain PCBs as many commercial 
and health food varieties do. It does not contain cobalt (the blue or green 
granules) which causes heart disease and draws cancer parasites to the skin. 
Commercial detergents and non-soaps are simply not safe. Switch to homemade bar 
soap, washing soda and borax for all your tasks! Borax inhibits the bacterial 
enzyme urease and is therefore antibacterial. It may even clear your skin of 
blemishes and stop your scalp from itching.</p> 
<h3> For Laundry </h3> 
<p> Borax (1/2 cup per load). It is the main ingredient of non-chlorine bleach 
and has excellent cleaning power without fading colors. It can be combined with 
washing soda for extra cleaning power. Your regular laundry soap may contain 
PCBs, aluminum, cobalt and other chemicals. These get rubbed into your skin 
constantly as you wear your clothing. For bleaching (only do this occasionally) 
use original chlorine bleach (not &quot;new improved&quot; or &quot;with 
special brighteners&quot;, and so forth). Don't use chlorine if there is an ill 
person in the house. For getting out stubborn dirt at collars, scrub with 
homemade bar soap first; for stains, try grain alcohol, vinegar, baking soda.
</p> 
<h3> For Dishes </h3> 
<p> Don't believe your eyes when you see the commercials where the smiling 
person pulls a shining dish out of greasy suds. Any dish soap that you use 
should be safe enough to eat because nothing rinses off clean. Regular dish 
detergents, including health brands, are now polluted with PCBs. They also 
contain harmful chemicals. Use borax and washing soda (equal amounts) for your 
dishes. Or use paper plates and plastic (not styrofoam) cups.</p> 
<h3> In The Dishwasher </h3> 
<p> Use 2 tsp. borax powder pre-dissolved in water. If you use too much it 
will leave a film on your dishes. Use vinegar in the rinse cycle.</p> 
<h3> In The Sink </h3> 
<p> Use a dishpan in the sink. Use l/4 cup borax plus l/4 cup washing soda and 
add a minimum of water. Also keep a bit of dry washing soda in a saucer by the 
sink for scouring. Don't use any soap at all for dishes that aren't greasy and 
can be washed under the faucet with nothing but running water. Throw away your 
old sponge or brush or cloth because it may be PCB contaminated. Start each day 
by sterilizing your sponge (it harbors Salmonella) or with a new one while the 
used one dries for three full days. Clean greasy pots and pans with a paper 
towel first. Then use homemade bar soap.</p> 
<pre> Figure 88: Make a bottle of borax liquid to fill your soap dispensers 
and shampoo bottle. Use citric acid to rinse and condition.</pre> 
<h3> Shampoo </h3> 
<p> Borax liquid is ready to use as shampoo, too. It does not lather but goes 
right to work removing sweat and soil without stripping your color or natural 
oils. It inhibits scalp bacteria and stops flaking and itching. Hair gets 
squeaky clean so quickly (just a few squirts does it) that you might think 
nothing has happened! You will soon be accustomed to non-lathery soap. Rinse 
very thoroughly because you should leave your scalp slightly acidic. Take a 
pint container to the shower with you. Put 1/4 tsp. citric (not ascorbic) acid 
crystals (see Sources) in it. For long hair use a quart of rinse. Only citric 
acid is strong enough to get the borax out, lemon juice and vinegar are not. 
After shampooing, fill the container with water and rinse. Rinse your whole 
body, too, since citric acid is also anti-bacterial. All hair shampoo 
penetrates the eye lids and gets into the eyes although you do not feel it. It 
is important to use this natural rinse to neutralize the shampoo in your eyes. 
(Some people have stated that citric acid makes their hair curlier or reddens 
it. If this is undesirable, use only half as much citric acid.) Citric acid 
also conditions and gives body and sheen to hair.</p> 
<h3> Hair Spray </h3> 
<p> I don't have a recipe that holds your hair as well as the bottle of 
chemicals you can buy at the store. Remarkably a little lemon juice (not from a 
bottle) has some holding power and no odor! Buy a 1 cup spray bottle. Squeeze 
part of a lemon, letting only the clear juice run into the bottle. Fill with 
water. Keep it in the refrigerator. Make it fresh every week. Spraying with 
just plain water is nearly as good! For shinier hair, drop a bit of lemon peel 
into the bottle.</p> 
<h3> Homemade Soap </h3> 
<pre> A small plastic dishpan, about 10&quot; x 12&quot; A glass or enamel 
2-quart sauce pan 1 can of lye (sodium hydroxide), 12 ounces 3 pounds of lard 
(BHT and BHA are OK here) Plastic gloves Water 1. Pour 3 cups of very cold 
water (refrigerate water overnight first) into the 2-quart saucepan. 2. Slowly 
and carefully add the lye, a little bit at a time, stirring it with a wooden or 
plastic utensil. (Use plastic gloves for this; test them for holes first.) Do 
not breathe the vapor or lean over the container or have children nearby. Above 
all use no metal. The mixture will get very hot. In olden days, a sassafras 
branch was used to stir, imparting a fragrance and insect deterrent for 
mosquitoes, lice, fleas, ticks. 3. Let cool at least one hour in a safe place. 
Meanwhile, the unwrapped lard should be warming up to room temperature in the 
plastic dishpan. 4. Slowly and carefully, pour the lye solution into the 
dishpan with the lard. The lard will melt. Mix thoroughly, at least 15 minutes, 
until it looks like thick pudding. 5. Let it set until the next morning; then 
cut it into bars. It will get harder after a few days. Then package.</pre> 
<p> If you wish to make soap based on olive oil, use about 48 ounces. It may 
need to harden for a week.</p> 
<h3> Liquid Soap </h3> 
<p> Make chips from your homemade soap cake. Add enough hot water to dissolve. 
Add citric acid to balance the pH (7 to 8). If you do not, this soap may be too 
harsh for your skin.</p> 
<h3> Skin Sanitizer </h3> 
<p> Make up a 5 to 10% solution of food grade alcohol. Food grade alcohols are 
grain (ethyl) alcohol or vodka. Find a suitable dispenser bottle. Mark it with 
a pen at about one tenth of the way up from the bottom. Pour 95% grain alcohol 
(190 proof) to this mark (for 50% grain alcohol or vodka make your mark one 
fifth of the way up). Add water to the top. Keep shut. You may add a chip of 
lemon peel for fragrance.</p> 
<p> Use this for general sanitizing purposes: bathroom fixtures, knobs, 
handles, canes, walkers, and for personal cleanliness (but use chlorine bleach 
for the toilet bowl once a week). Always clean up after a bowel movement with 
wet toilet paper. This is not clean enough, though. Follow with a stronger damp 
paper towel. This is still not clean enough; use a final damp paper towel with 
skin sanitizer added. After washing hands, sanitize them too, pouring a bit on 
one palm and put finger tips of the other hand in it, scratch to get under 
nails, repeat on other hand. Rinse with water.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Do not use this recipe, nor 
keep any bottles of alcohol in the +++house of a recovering alcoholic. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h3> Deodorant </h3> 
<p> Your sweat is odorless. It is the entrenched bacteria feeding on it that 
make smells. You can never completely rid yourself of these bacteria, although 
they may temporarily be gone after zapping. The strategy is to control their 
numbers. Here are several deodorants to try. Find one that works best for you:
</p> 
<p> Vitamin C water. Mix 1/4 tsp. to a pint of water and dab it on. Then dab 
on cornstarch.</p> 
<p> Citric Acid water. Mix 1/4 tsp. to a pint of water and dab it on. Then dab 
on cornstarch.</p> 
<p> Only a few drops of these acids under each armpit are necessary. If these 
acids burn the skin, dilute them more. Never apply anything to skin that has 
just been shaved!</p> 
<p> Corn starch. Many people need only this. Dab it on. </p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Use only unpolluted cornstarch 
(see Sources). ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> Baking soda has been deleted as a deodorant because benzene was found in 
some boxes.</p> 
<p> Lemon juice. This acid is not as strong, use what you need. </p> 
<p> Pure alcohol (never rubbing alcohol). The food grade alcohols are grain 
alcohol and vodka. Dab a bit under each arm and/or on your shirt or blouse, 
then dab on cornstarch. If the alcohol burns, dilute it with water. Be very 
careful not to leave the bottle where a child or alcoholic person could find 
it. Pour it into a different bottle!</p> 
<p> Pure zinc oxide. You may ask your pharmacist to order this for you. She or 
he may wish to make it up for you too, but do not let them add anything else to 
it. It should be about 1 part zinc oxide powder to 3 parts water. It does not 
dissolve. Just shake it up to use it. After you get it home, you can add 
cornstarch to it to give it a creamy texture. Heat 3 tsp. cornstarch in 1 cup 
of water, to boiling, until dissolved and clear. Cool and add some to the zinc 
oxide mixture (about equal parts). Store unused starch mixture in the 
refrigerator. Only make up enough for a month.</p> 
<p> Alcohol and zinc oxide. This is the most powerful deodorant. Apply alcohol 
first, then the zinc oxide, then dab on cornstarch.</p> 
<p> Remember that you need to sweat! Sweating excretes toxic substances, 
especially from the upper body. Don't use deodorant on weekends. Go to the sink 
and wipe clean the armpits like our grandparents did. Often, just plain 
cornstarch is enough! These homemade deodorants are not as powerful as the 
commercial varieties-this is to your advantage.</p> 
<h3> Brushing Teeth </h3> 
<p> Buy a new toothbrush. Your old one is soaked with toxins from your old 
toothpaste. Use only water or chemically pure baking soda if you have any metal 
fillings. Put a pinch in a glass, add water to dissolve it. Use food-grade 
hydrogen peroxide (see Sources) if you have only plastic fillings. Dilute it 
from 35% to 17l/2% by adding water (equal parts). Store hydrogen peroxide only 
in polyethylene or the original plastic bottle. Use 4 or 5 drops on your 
toothbrush. It should fizz nicely as oxygen is produced in your mouth. Your 
teeth will whiten noticeably in 6 months. Before brushing teeth, floss with 4 
or 2 pound monofilament fish line. Double it and twist for extra strength. 
Rinse before use. Floss and brush only once a day. If this leaves you 
uncomfortable, brush the extra times with plain water and a second 
&quot;water-only&quot; toothbrush. Make sure that nothing solid, like powder, 
is on your toothbrush; it will scour the enamel and give you sensitive teeth, 
especially as you get older and the enamel softens. Salt is corrosive-don't use 
it for brushing metal teeth. Plain water is just as good.</p> 
<h3> For Dentures </h3> 
<p> Use salt water. It kills all germs and is inexpensive. Salt water plus 
grain alcohol or food-grade hydrogen peroxide makes a good denture-soak.</p> 
<h3> Mouthwash </h3> 
<p> A few drops of food grade hydrogen peroxide added to a little water in a 
glass should be enough to make your mouth foam and cleanse. Don't use hydrogen 
peroxide, though, if you have metal fillings, because they react. Don't use 
regular drug store variety hydrogen peroxide because it contains toxic 
additives. Health food store varieties contain solvents from the bottling 
process. See Sources. Never purchase hydrogen peroxide in a bottle with a metal 
cap.</p> 
<p> For persons with metal tooth fillings, use chemically pure baking soda or 
just plain hot water. A healthy mouth has no odor! You shouldn't need a 
mouthwash! If you have breath odor, search for a hidden tooth infection or 
cavitation.</p> 
<h3> Contact Lens Solution </h3> 
<p> A scant cup of cold tap water brought to a boil in glass saucepan. After 
adding l/4 tsp. aluminum free salt and boiling again, pour into a sterile 
canning jar. Refrigerate. Freeze some of it.</p> 
<h3> Lip Soother </h3> 
<p> For dry, burning lips. Heat 1 level tsp. sodium alginate plus 1 cup water 
until dissolved. After cooling, pour it into a small bottle to carry in your 
purse or pocket (refrigerate the remainder). Dab it on whenever needed. If the 
consistency isn't right for you, add water or boil it down further. You can 
make a better lip soother by adding some lysine from a crushed tablet, vitamin 
C powder, and a vitamin E capsule to the alginate mix. If you have a persistent 
problem with chapped lips, try going off citrus juice.</p> 
<h3> Foot Powder </h3> 
<p> Use a mixture of cornstarch and zinc oxide poured into a salt shaker with 
a lid. Add long rice grains to fight humidity. You may also try arrow root or 
potato starch. If you don't have zinc oxide use plain cornstarch.</p> 
<h3> Skin Healer Moisturizer Lotion </h3> 
<pre> 1 tsp. sodium alginate 1 cup water </pre> 
<p> Make the base first by heating these together in a covered, non-metal pan 
until completely dissolved. Use low heat-it will take over an hour. Use a 
wooden spoon handle to stir. Set aside.</p> 
<p> Then make the following mixture: </p> 
<pre> 1/4 tsp. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (You may crush tablets) 1/4 tsp. 
lysine (crush tablets) 2 tbs. pure vegetable glycerin 2 vitamin E capsules (400 
units or more, each) 1 tsp. apricot kernel oil (olive oil will do) 1 tbs. lemon 
juice from a lemon or 1/4 tsp citric acid (this is optional) 1 cup water</pre> 
<p> Heat the water to steaming in a non-metal pan. Add vitamin C and lysine 
first and then everything else. Pour into a pint jar and shake to mix. Then add 
the sodium alginate base to the desired thickness (about equal amounts) and 
shake. Pour some into a small bottle to use as lip soother. Pour some into a 
larger bottle to dispense on skin. Store remainder in refrigerator. (See 
Sources for sodium alginate, vegetable glycerin and apricot kernel oil. Sodium 
alginate is also available in capsule form at some health food stores.)</p> 
<h3> Other Skin Healers </h3> 
<p> Vitamin C powder (ascorbic acid, not the same as citric acid). Put a large 
pinch into the palm of your hand. With your other hand pick up a few drops of 
water from the faucet. Rub hands together until all the powder is dissolved and 
dispensed. It may sting briefly. Do this at bedtime, especially for cracked, 
chapped hands. Include lips if they need it.</p> 
<p> Vitamin E oil. Vitamin E oil from Now Foods was not polluted at the time 
of this writing, but for the future it would be safer to rely on capsules. Snip 
open a capsule and rub into skin.</p> 
<p> 50% Glycerin. Dilute 100% vegetable glycerin with an equal amount of 
water. This is useful as an after shave lotion.</p> 
<p> Vitamin C liquid. Mix l/4 tsp. vitamin C powder in one pint water (crushed 
tablets will do). This is useful as an after shave lotion and general skin 
treatment.</p> 
<p> Apricot Kernel Oil. This is a very light oil, useful as an after shave 
lotion and general skin treatment.</p> 
<p> Cornstarch (see Sources). Use on rashes, fungus, moist or irritated areas 
and to prevent chafe.</p> 
<p> Combining several of these makes them more effective. </p> 
<p> Dry skin has several causes: too much water contact, too much soap contact 
(switch to borax), low body temperature, not enough fat in the diet, or 
parasites.</p> 
<h3> Massage Oil </h3> 
<p> Use olive oil. It comes in very light to heavy textures. Pick the right 
one for your purpose. Alginate mixtures can be used instead of, or added to, 
oil. Starch solutions are good, too.</p> 
<h3> Sun-screen Lotion </h3> 
<p> Purchase PABA (see Sources) in 500 mg tablet form. Dissolve 1 tablet in 
grain alcohol or vodka. Grind the tablet first by putting it in a plastic bag 
and rolling over it with a glass jar. It will not completely dissolve even if 
you use a tablespoon of the alcohol. Pour the whole mixture into a 4 ounce 
bottle of homemade skin softener. Be careful not to get the lotion into your 
eyes when applying it. A better solution is to wear a hat or stay out of the 
sun. Remember to take PABA as a supplement, too (500 mg, one a day).</p> 
<h3> Nose Salve </h3> 
<p> (When the inside of the nose is dry, cracked and bleeding.) </p> 
<p> Pour 1/2 tsp. pure vegetable glycerin into a bottle cap. Add 1/2 tsp. of 
water.</p> 
<p> Applicator: use a plastic coffee stirrer or straw; cut a slit in the end 
to catch some cotton wool salvaged from a vitamin bottle and twist (cotton 
swabs, cotton balls and wooden toothpicks are sterilized with mercury which in 
turn is polluted with thallium). Dip it into the glycerin mixture and apply 
inside the nose with a rotating motion. Do each nostril with a new applicator.
</p> 
<h3> Quick Corn Starch Skin Softener </h3> 
<pre> 4 tsp. corn starch (see Sources) 1 cup water </pre> 
<p> Boil starch and water until clear, about one minute. </p> 
<h3> Cornstarch Skin Softener </h3> 
<pre> 1 tsp. lysine powder or 8 tablets, 500 mg each 1 tsp. Vitamin C powder 
(ascorbic acid); or 8 tablets, 500 mg each 3 tsp. cornstarch (see Sources) 
Vitamin E, 1 capsule 400 mg 1/4 tsp. apricot kernel oil (optional) 1 cup water
</pre> 
<p> Boil starch and water until clear, about one minute. Add other ingredients 
and stir until dissolved. Cool. Pour into dispenser bottle. Keep refrigerated 
when not in use. Apply after washing dishes and after showering.</p> 
<h3> After Shaves </h3> 
<p> Vitamin C. 1/4 tsp. vitamin C powder, dissolved in 1 pint water. </p> 
<p> Apricot kernel oil. </p> 
<p> Vegetable glycerin. Equal parts glycerin and water or to suit your need. 
</p> 
<h3> Personal Lubricants </h3> 
<p> Heat these together: 1 level tsp. sodium alginate and 1 cup water in a 
covered non-metal pan until completely dissolved. Use very low heat and stir 
with a wooden spoon handle. It takes a fairly long time to get it perfectly 
smooth. After cooling, pour into a small dispenser bottle. Keep the remainder 
refrigerated.</p> 
<p> Or, mix and heat 4 tsp. cornstarch and 1 cup water until completely 
dissolved in a covered saucepan. Use non-metal dishes and a non-metal stirring 
spoon. Cool. Pour some into dispenser bottle. Refrigerate remainder. This is 
many person's favorite recipe.</p> 
<h3> Baby Wipes </h3> 
<p> Cut paper towels in quarters and stack in a closable plastic box. Run tap 
water over them, drain the excess. Add 1 tsp. grain alcohol and/or borax liquid 
on top. Close. Put a dab of the Quick Cornstarch Softener recipe on top of each 
wipe as you use it.</p> 
<h3> People Wipes </h3> 
<pre> 1/4 tsp. powdered lysine (you may crush tablets) 1/4 tsp. Vitamin C 
powder (you may crush tablets) 1/4 cup vegetable glycerin 1 cup water</pre> 
<p> Prepare wipes by cutting paper towels in quarters. Use white, unfragranced 
towels that are strong enough to hold up for this use. Fold each piece in 
quarters again and stack in a plastic zippered baggy. Pour the fluid mixture 
over the stack and zip. Store a bag full in the freezer to take on car trips. 
If you want to keep them a month or more, add 1 tbs. grain alcohol or vodka to 
the recipe.</p> 
<p> For bathroom use, dampen a roll of paper towels under the cold tap first. 
Then pour about 1/4 cup of the mixture over the towel roll around the middle. 
Store in plastic shopping bag or stand in plastic waste basket.</p> 
<h3> Recipes For Natural Cosmetics </h3> 
<h2> Eye liner and Eyebrow Pencil </h2> 
<p> Get a pure charcoal pencil (black only) at an art supply store. Try 
several on yourself (bring a small mirror) in the store to see what hardness 
suits you. You may need to wet it with water or a vitamin E perle first. Don't 
put any chemicals on your eyelids, since this penetrates into your eye. To 
check this out for yourself, close your eye tightly and then dab lemon juice on 
your eyelid. It will soon burn! Everything that is put on skin penetrates. 
Otherwise the nicotine patch and estrogen patch wouldn't work. Not even soap 
belongs on your eyelids! Charcoal pencils are cheap. Get yourself half a dozen 
different kinds so you can do different things.</p> 
<p> You could also use a capsule of activated charcoal. Empty it into a 
saucer. Mix glycerin and water, half and half, and add it to the charcoal 
powder until you get the consistency you like. Use a brush for eyelashes; use a 
finger for eyebrows.</p> 
<h2> Lipstick </h2> 
<pre> Beet root powder (see Sources) 100% vegetable glycerin </pre> 
<p> Combine 1 tsp. vegetable glycerin and 1 tsp. beet root powder in a saucer. 
Stir until perfectly smooth. Then add l/2 tsp. of vitamin E oil. Snip open 
vitamin E capsules or buy vitamin E oil (see Sources). Very thick olive oil can 
be substituted. Apply liberally with your finger or a lipstick brush. Do not 
purse or rub your lips together after application. To make the lipstick stay on 
longer, apply 1 layer of lipstick, then dab some corn starch over the lips, 
then apply another layer of lipstick. Store in a small glass or plastic 
container in the refrigerator, tightly covered in a plastic bag.</p> 
<h3> Face Powder </h3> 
<p> Use cornstarch from the original box. You may also try arrow root starch 
or potato starch. Use your fingers or a tissue to apply because applicators can 
carry bacteria.</p> 
<h3> Blush (face powder in a cake form) </h3> 
<p> Add 50% glycerin to cornstarch in a saucer to make a paste. Slowly add 
beet root powder to the desired color. Use part of a charcoal capsule to darken 
it, if desired. A drop of food grade alcohol will also darken it. To make 50% 
glycerin, add equal parts of glycerin and water. Try to make the consistency 
the same as your brand name product, and you can even put it back in your brand 
name container.</p> 
<h2> Recipes For Household Products </h2> 
<h3> Floor Cleaner </h3> 
<p> Use washing soda from the grocery store. You may add borax and boric acid 
(to deter insects except ants). Use white distilled vinegar in your rinse water 
for a natural shine and ant repellent. Do not add bleach to this. For the 
bathroom floor use plain bleach water-follow the label. Never use chlorine 
bleach if anybody in the home is ill or suffers from depression. Use grain 
alcohol (1 pint to 3 quarts water) for germ killing action instead of chlorine.
</p> 
<h3> Furniture Duster and Window Cleaner </h3> 
<p> Mix equal parts white distilled vinegar and water. Put it in a spray 
bottle.</p> 
<h3> Furniture Polish </h3> 
<p> A few drops of olive oil on a dampened cloth. Use filtered water to dampen.
</p> 
<h3> Insect Killer </h3> 
<p> Boric acid powder (not borax). Throw liberal amounts behind stove, 
refrigerator, under carpets and in carpets. Since boric acid is white, you must 
be careful not to mistake it for sugar accidentally. Keep it far away from food 
and out of children's reach. Buy it at a farm supply or garden store (or see 
Sources). It will not kill ants.</p> 
<h3> Ant Repellent </h3> 
<p> Spray 50% white distilled vinegar on counter tops, window sills and 
shelves and wipe, leaving residue. Start early in spring before they arrive, 
because it takes a few weeks to rid yourself of them once they are established. 
If you want immediate action, get some lemons, cut the yellow outer peel off 
and cover with grain alcohol in a tightly closed jar. Let stand at least one 
hour. Use 1 part of this concentrate with 9 parts water in a spray bottle. Mix 
only as much as you will use because the diluted form loses potency. Spray 
walls, floors, carpets wherever you see them. The lemon solution even leaves a 
shine on your counters. Use both vinegar and lemon approaches to rid yourself 
of ants.</p> 
<p> To treat the whole house, pour vinegar all around your foundation, close 
to the wall, using one gallon for every five feet. Expect to damage any foliage 
it touches. Reapply every six months.</p> 
<h3> Flower and Foliage Spray </h3> 
<p> Food-grade hydrogen peroxide. See instructions on bottle. </p> 
<h3> Moth Balls </h3> 
<p> I found this recipe in an old recipe book. Mix the following and scatter 
in trunks and bags containing furs and woolens: 1/2 lb. each rosemary and mint, 
1/4 lb. each tansy and thyme, 2 tbs. powdered cloves.</p> 
<h3> Carpet Cleaner </h3> 
<p> Whether you rent a machine or have a cleaning service, don't use the 
carpet shampoo they want to sell, even if they &quot;guarantee&quot; that it is 
all natural and safe. Instead add these to a bucket (about four gallons) of 
water and use it as the cleaning solution:</p> 
<pre> Wash water Rinse water 1/3 cup borax 1/4 cup grain alcohol 2 tsp. boric 
acid 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar or 4 tsp. citric acid</pre> 
<p> Borax does the cleaning; alcohol disinfects, boric acid leaves a pesticide 
residue, and the vinegar or citric acid give luster. If you are just making one 
pass on your carpet, use the borax, alcohol, and boric acid. Remember to test 
everything you use on an unnoticed piece of carpet first.</p> 
<h2> Health Improvement Recipes </h2> 
<h3> Black Walnut Hull Tincture </h3> 
<p> This new recipe is four times as strong as the previous one, so it is 
called Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength.</p> 
<pre> - Your largest enamel or ceramic (not stainless steel, not aluminum) 
cooking pot, preferably at least 10 quarts - Black walnuts, in the hull, each 
one still at least 50% green, enough to fill the pot to the top - Grain 
alcohol, about 50% strength, enough to cover the walnuts - 1/2 tsp. vitamin C - 
Plastic wrap or cellophane - Glass jars or bottles</pre> 
<p> The black walnut tree produces large green balls in fall. The walnut is 
inside, but we will use the whole ball, uncracked, since the active ingredient 
is in the green outer hull. Rinse the walnuts carefully, put them in the pot, 
and cover with the alcohol. Sprinkle on half the vitamin C. Seal with plas tic 
wrap and cover. Let sit for three days. Pour into glass jars or bottles, 
discarding walnuts, and divide the remaining vitamin C amongst the jars. If the 
glass jar has a metal lid, first put plastic wrap over the top before screwing 
on the lid. Potency is strong for several years if unopened, even if it darkens.
</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++You have just made Extra 
Strength Black Walnut Hull +++Tincture. It is stronger than the concentrate 
made with just a few +++black walnuts in a quart jar (my earlier recipe), 
because there +++are more walnuts per unit liquid. In addition, you will not 
dilute +++it before use (although when you take it, it will usually be in 
+++water). ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> When preparing the walnuts, rinse only with cold tap water. You may need 
to use a brush on areas with dirt. If you are not going to use all of them in 
this batch, you may freeze them in a resealable plastic bag. Simply 
refrigerating them does not keep them from turning black and useless. The pot 
of soaking walnuts should not be refrigerated. Nor does the final tincture need 
any refrigeration.</p> 
<p> Exposure to air does cause the tincture to darken and lose potency. To 
reduce air exposure, fill the pot as much as possible, without touching the 
plastic wrap, while still keeping a snug fitting lid. Even more importantly, 
the glass jars or bottles you use to store your tincture should have as little 
air space as possible, without touching the plastic wrap on top. A large jar 
should be divided into smaller ones when you are ready to use it. The idea is 
not to have partial jars, with a lot of air space, sitting for longer than a 
month or so.</p> 
<p> There are several ways to make a 50% grain alcohol solution. Some states 
have Everclear(TM) 95% alcohol. Mix this half and half with water. Other states 
have Everclear that is 76.5% alcohol. Mix this three parts Everclear to one 
part water. Yet another method is to buy vodka that is 100 proof. This is 
already 50% alcohol.</p> 
<p> Remember, never use any kind of purchased water to make tincture. </p> 
<h4> Black Walnut Hull Tincture (Regular Strength) </h4> 
<p> This is the potency I used originally. It is included here in case you 
prefer it or wish to treat a pet. The Extra Strength recipe is four times as 
potent as the original recipe, so it must be diluted in quarters. (Similarly, 
if you have a lot of the Regular Strength left and want to use it in place of 
Extra Strength, simply take four times as much.)</p> 
<pre> - Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength - Grain Alcohol about 10% 
</pre> 
<p> Mix one part extra strength tincture with three parts of the 10% alcohol. 
Store in glass containers same as described above.</p> 
<p> There are several ways to make a 10% grain alcohol solution. Some states 
have Everclear(TM) 95% alcohol. Mix this one part Everclear to nine parts 
water. Other states have Everclear that is 76.5% alcohol. Mix this one part 
Everclear to seven parts water. Yet another method is to buy vodka that is 100 
proof (50% alcohol) and mix one part vodka with four parts water.</p> 
<h4> Black Walnut Hull Extract (Water Based) </h4> 
<p> Because you do not know how commercially available extracts were made, and 
may not be able to test for solvent pollution, it is wisest to make it yourself!
</p> 
<p> This recipe is intended for alcoholic persons: cover the green balls in 
the 10 quart (non-metal) pot with cold tap water. Heat to boiling, covered. 
Turn off heat. When cool, add vitamin C, cover with plastic wrap, and the lid. 
Let stand for 1 day. It will be darker than the tincture. Do not dilute. Pour 
into freezable containers. Refrigerate what you will use in two days and freeze 
the rest. Add vitamin C after thawing or during refrigeration (1/4 tsp. per 
quart).</p> 
<p> For use: in programs calling for Extra Strength Black Walnut Hull Tincture 
use four times as much of this water based recipe (8 tsp. instead of 2 tsp. 
Extra Strength).</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Important Note: do not use 
bottled or purchased water to +++make this tincture or you could pollute it 
with benzene ! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> Quassia recipe 
<p> Add 1/8 cup quassia chips to 3 cups water. Simmer 20-30 minutes. Pour off 
1/8 cup now and drink it fresh. Refrigerate remainder. Drink 1/8 cup 4 
times/day, until a total of l/2 cup of chips is consumed. Flavor with spices.
</p> 
<h3> Emmenagogue (Menstrual Period Inducer) </h3> 
<p> Here are four herbs that can each bring on your period. They can be 
started anytime but the most effective time is before your next calculated 
period time (count days as if you never missed a period).</p> 
<pre> - 1 oz sassafras bark - 1 oz rue (cut) - 1 oz marjoram herb - 1 oz blue 
cohosh root - 4 1/2 cups boiling water</pre> 
<p> Add the herbs to the boiling water and turn down to simmer, covered, for 
20 minutes. Do not boil. Strain and refrigerate in sterile glass jar. Pour one 
cup for yourself in the morning. Let warm to room temperature, and sip between 
meals, making it last until supper.</p> 
<h3> Bowel Program </h3> 
<p> Bacteria are always at the root of bowel problems, such as pain, bloating 
and gassiness. They can not be killed by zapping, because the high frequency 
current does not penetrate the bowel contents.</p> 
<p> Although most bowel bacteria are beneficial, the ones that are not, like 
Salmonellas and Shigellas, are extremely detrimental because they have the 
ability to invade the rest of your body and colonize a trauma site or weakened 
organ. These same bacteria colonize a cancer tumor and delay healing after the 
malignancy is stopped.</p> 
<p> Another reason bowel bacteria are so hard to eradicate is that we are 
constantly reinfecting ourselves by keeping a reservoir on our hands and under 
our fingernails.</p> 
<pre> -&gt; So the first thing to do is improve sanitation. For a serious 
problem, use 50% grain alcohol (100 proof vodka) in a spray bottle at the 
bathroom sink. Sterilize your hands after bathroom use and before meals. -&gt; 
Secondly use turmeric (2 capsules 3 times a day, this is the common spice) 
which I find helps against Shigella, as well as E. coli. Expect orange colored 
stool. -&gt; Third use fennel (1 capsule 3 times a day). -&gt; Fourth use 
digestive enzyme tablets with meals as directed on the bottle. (But only as 
long as necessary, because these frequently harbor molds.) -&gt; Fifth use a 
single 2 tsp. dose of Black Walnut Hull Tincture Extra Strength. Add it to a 
1/2 glass of water and sip over a 15 minute period. Stay seated until any side 
effect from the alcohol wears off. -&gt; Sixth take Cascara sagrada capsules if 
constipated (start with one capsule a day, use up to maximum on label). 
Remember to drink a cup of hot water upon rising in the morning. This will 
begin to regulate your elimination.</pre> 
<p> It can take all six to get rid of a bad Shigella problem in a week. 
Afterward, you must continue to eat only sterile dairy products. Note that the 
Kidney Cleanse is often effective with bowel problems. Try it also.</p> 
<p> You will know you succeeded when your tummy is flat, there is not a single 
gurgle, and your mood improves!</p> 
<h3> Constipation Tea </h3> 
<p> Constipation is often caused by E. coli and Salmonella from dairy foods, 
or from killing &quot;good&quot; bowel bacteria with antibiotics (killing a few 
by zapping actually restores good flora). Eat foods that restore the body's 
good bowel flora: vegetables, sterilized milk (the milk sugar is essential), 
lots of water.</p> 
<p> There are a lot of remedies for constipation, but many people enjoy this 
tea:</p> 
<pre> - 1 tbs senna tea leaves - 1/2 tsp. mint leaves </pre> 
<p> Boil for one minute in a quart of water, add a dash of vitamin C and brown 
sugar to taste. Sip through the day to avoid &quot;belly-ache&quot;. It can 
take years for the body's flora to &quot;right themselves&quot; after an 
antibiotic session, be patient.</p> 
<h3> Weight Reduction </h3> 
<p> Here are two ancient herbal recipes for obesity. I have not personally 
determined their effectiveness.</p> 
<h4> Fucus </h4> 
<pre> - 2 oz Fucus vesiculosus, cut (see Sources) - 3 cups cold tap water 
</pre> 
<p> Boil for 15 minutes, covered. Cool. Dose: 1/4 cup four times a day on an 
empty stomach. After one week increase dose to 1/2 cup. You may add any 
flavoring desired.</p> 
<p> Watch the pot carefully as it comes to a boil. If it boils over, you will 
have a month of stove-cleaning to do. The odor of Fucus boiling is wretched. So 
is the taste. Maybe garlic (fresh) would improve it.</p> 
<h4> Fennel </h4> 
<pre> - 1 oz fennel seed (crushed or powdered is fine) - 3 cups cold tap water 
</pre> 
<p> Boil water, pour over herb. Steep 30 minutes. Strain. Add 4 oz honey 
(optional). Drink one cup each day.</p> 
<p> You could take them both together, along with the Bowel Program, to be 
more successful, but the best single weight reducer is the liver cleanse.</p> 
<h3> Kidney Cleanse </h3> 
<pre> - 1/2 cup dried Hydrangea root - 1/2 cup Gravel root - 1/2 cup 
Marshmallow root - 4 bunches of fresh parsley - Goldenrod tincture (leave this 
out of the recipe if you are allergic to it) - Ginger capsules - Uva Ursi 
capsules - Vegetable glycerin - Black Cherry Concentrate, 8 oz - Vitamin B6, 
250 mg - Magnesium oxide tablets. 300 mg</pre> 
<p> Measure 1/4 cup of each root and set them to soak, together in 10 cups of 
cold tap water, using a non-metal container and a non-metal lid (a dinner plate 
will do). After four hours (or overnight) add 8 oz. black cherry concentrate, 
heat to boiling and simmer for 20 minutes. Drink 1/4 cup as soon as it is cool 
enough. Pour the rest through a bamboo strainer into a sterile pint jar (glass) 
and several freezable containers. Refrigerate the glass jar.</p> 
<p> Boil the fresh parsley, after rinsing, in 1 quart of water for 3 minutes. 
Drink 1/4 cup when cool enough. Refrigerate a pint and freeze 1 pint. Throw 
away the parsley.</p> 
<p> Dose: each morning, pour together 3/4 cup of the root mixture and 1/2 cup 
parsley water, filling a large mug. Add 20 drops of goldenrod tincture and 1 
tbs. of glycerin. Drink this mixture in divided doses throughout the day. Keep 
cold. Do not drink it all at once or you will get a stomach ache and feel 
pressure in your bladder. If your stomach is very sensitive, start on half this 
dose.</p> 
<p> Save the roots after the first boiling, storing them in the freezer. After 
13 days when your supply runs low, boil the same roots a second time, but add 
only 6 cups water and simmer only 10 minutes. This will last another 8 days, 
for a total of three weeks. You may cook the roots a third time if you wish, 
but the recipe gets less potent. If your problem is severe, only cook them 
twice.</p> 
<p> After three weeks, repeat with fresh herbs. You need to do the Kidney 
Cleanse for six weeks to get good results, longer for severe problems.</p> 
<p> Also take: </p> 
<pre> Ginger capsules: one with each meal (3/day). Uva Ursi capsules: one with 
breakfast and two with supper. Vitamin B6 (250 mg): one a day. Magnesium oxide 
(300 mg): one a day.</pre> 
<p> Take these supplements just before your meal to avoid burping. </p> 
<p> Some notes on this recipe: this herbal tea, as well as the parsley, can 
easily spoil. Heat it to boiling every fourth day if it is being stored in the 
refrigerator; this resterilizes it. If you sterilize it in the morning you may 
take it to work without refrigerating it (use a glass container).</p> 
<p> When you order your herbs, be careful! Herb companies are not the same! 
These roots should have a strong fragrance. If the ones you buy are barely 
fragrant, they have lost their active ingredients; switch to a different 
supplier. Fresh roots can be used. Do not use powder.</p> 
<p> Hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens) is a common flowering bush. </p> 
<p> Gravel root (Eupatorium purpureum) is a wild flower. </p> 
<p> Marshmallow root (Althea officinallis) is mucilaginous and kills pain. </p>
<p> Fresh parsley can be bought at a grocery store. Parsley flakes and dried 
parsley herb do not work.</p> 
<p> Goldenrod herb works as well as the tincture but you may get an allergic 
reaction from smelling the herb. If you know you are allergic to this, leave 
this one out of your recipe.</p> 
<p> Ginger from the grocery store works fine; you may put it into capsules for 
yourself (size 0, 1 or 00).</p> 
<p> There are probably dozens of herbs that can dissolve kidney crystals and 
stones. If you can only find several of those in the recipe, make the recipe 
anyway; it will just take longer to get results. Remember that vitamin B6 and 
magnesium, taken daily, can prevent oxalate stones from forming. But only if 
you stop drinking tea. Tea has 15.6 mg oxalic acid per cup (taken from 
&quot;Food Values&quot; 14ed by Pennington and Church 1985). A tall glass of 
iced tea could give you over 20 mg oxalic acid. Switch to herb teas. Cocoa and 
chocolate, also, have too much oxalic acid to be used as beverages.</p> 
<p> Remember, too, that phosphate crystals are made when you eat too much 
phosphate. Phosphate levels are high in meats, breads, cereals, pastas, and 
carbonated drinks. Eat less of these, and increase your milk (2%), fruits and 
vegetables. Drink at least 2 pints of water a day.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Cleanse your kidneys at least 
twice a year. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> You can dissolve all your kidney stones in 3 weeks, but make new ones in 3 
days if you are drinking tea and cocoa and phosphated beverages. None of the 
beverage recipes in this chapter are conducive to stone formation.</p> 
<h3> Liver Herbs </h3> 
<p> Don't confuse these liver herbs with the next recipe for the Liver 
Cleanse. This recipe contains herbs traditionally used to help the liver 
function, while the Liver Cleanse gets gallstones out.</p> 
<pre> - 6 parts comfrey root, Symphytum officinale (also called nipbone root) 
- 6 parts tanner's oak bark, Quercus alba (white oak bark) - 3 parts gravel 
root, Eupatorium purpureum (queen of the meadow) - 3 parts Jacob's staff, 
Verbascum thapsus (mullein herb) - 2 parts licorice root, Glycyrrhiza glabra - 
2 parts wild yam root, Dioscorea villosa - 2 parts milk thistle herb, Silybum 
marianum - 3 parts walnut bark, Juglans nigra, (black walnut bark) - 3 parts 
marshmallow root, Althea offcinalis (white mallow) - 1 part lobelia plant, 
Lobelia inflata (bladder pod) - 1 part skullcap, Scutellaria lateriflora 
(helmet flower)</pre> 
<p> Mix all the herbs. Add 1/2 cup of the mixture to 2 quarts of water. Bring 
to a boil. Put lid on. Let sit for six hours. Strain and drink as directed. Put 
the strained herbs in the freezer and use them one more time.</p> 
<h3> Liver Cleanse </h3> 
<p> Cleansing the liver of gallstones dramatically improves digestion, which 
is the basis of your whole health. You can expect your allergies to disappear, 
too, more with each cleanse you do! Incredibly, it also eliminates shoulder, 
upper arm, and upper back pain. You have more energy and increased sense of 
well being.</p> 
<p> Cleaning the liver bile ducts is the most powerful procedure that you can 
do to improve your body's health.</p> 
<p> But it should not be done before the parasite program, and for best 
results should follow the kidney cleanse and any dental work you need.</p> 
<p> It is the job of the liver to make bile, 1 to 1 1/2 quarts in a day! The 
liver is full of tubes (biliary tubing) that deliver the bile to one large tube 
(the common bile duct). The gallbladder is attached to the common bile duct and 
acts as a storage reservoir. Eating fat or protein triggers the gallbladder to 
squeeze itself empty after about twenty minutes, and the stored bile finishes 
its trip down the common bile duct to the intestine.</p> 
<p> For many persons. including children. the biliary tubing is choked with 
gallstones. Some develop allergies or hives but some have no symptoms. When the 
gallbladder is scanned or X-rayed nothing is seen. Typically, they are not in 
the gallbladder. Not only that, most are too small and not calcified, a 
prerequisite for visibility on X-ray. There are over half a dozen varieties of 
gallstones, most of which have cholesterol crystals in them. They can be black, 
red, white, green or tan colored. The green ones get their color from being 
coated with bile. Notice in the picture how many have embedded unidentified 
objects. Are they fluke remains? Notice how many are shaped like corks with 
longitudinal grooves below the tops. We can visualize the blocked bile ducts 
from such shapes. Other stones are composites-made of many smaller ones-showing 
that they regrouped in the bile ducts some time after the last cleanse.</p> 
<p> At the very center of each stone is found a clump of bacteria, according 
to scientists, suggesting a dead bit of parasite might have started the stone 
forming.</p> 
<p> As the stones grow and become more numerous the back pressure on the liver 
causes it to make less bile. Imagine the situation if your garden hose had 
marbles in it. Much less water would flow, which in turn would decrease the 
ability of the hose to squirt out the marbles. With gallstones, much less 
cholesterol leaves the body. and cholesterol levels may rise.</p> 
<pre> Figure 89: These are gallstones. </pre> 
<p> Gallstones, being porous, can pick up all the bacteria, cysts, viruses and 
parasites that are passing through the liver. In this way &quot;nests&quot; of 
infection are formed, forever supplying the body with fresh bacteria. No 
stomach infection such as ulcers or intestinal bloating can be cured 
permanently without removing these gallstones from the liver.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++Cleanse your liver twice a 
year. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<h3> Preparation. </h3> 
<pre> -&gt; You can't clean a liver with living parasites in it. You won't get 
many stones, and you will feel quite sick. Zap daily the week before. or get 
through the first three weeks of the parasite killing program before attempting 
a liver cleanse. If you are on the maintenance parasite program, you are always 
ready to do the cleanse. -&gt; Completing the kidney cleanse before cleansing 
the liver is also highly recommended. You want your kidneys, bladder and 
urinary tract in top working condition so they can efficiently remove any 
undesirable substances incidentally absorbed from the intestine as the bile is 
being excreted. -&gt; Do any dental work first, if possible. Your mouth should 
be metal free and bacteria free (cavitations are cleaned). A toxic mouth can 
put a heavy load on the liver, burdening it immediately after cleansing. 
Eliminate that problem first for best results.</pre> 
<h4> Ingredients </h4> 
<pre> Epsom salts 4 tablespoons Olive oil half cup (light olive oil is easier 
to get down) Fresh pink grapefruit 1 large or 2 small, enough to squeeze 2/3 to 
3/4 cup juice Ornithine 4 to 8, to be sure you can sleep. Don't skip this or 
you may have the worst night of your life! Large plastic straw To help drink 
potion. Pint jar with lid</pre> 
<p> Choose a day like Saturday for the cleanse, since you will be able to rest 
the next day.</p> 
<p> Take no medicines, vitamins or pills that you can do without; they could 
prevent success. Stop the parasite program and kidney herbs, too, the day 
before.</p> 
<p> Eat a no-fat breakfast and lunch such as cooked cereal with fruit, fruit 
juice, bread and preserves or honey (no butter or milk), baked potato or other 
vegetables with salt only. This allows the bile to build up and develop 
pressure in the liver. Higher pressure pushes out more stones.</p> 
<p> 2:00 PM. Do not eat or drink after 2 o'clock. If you break this rule you 
could feel quite ill later.</p> 
<p> Get your Epsom salts ready. Mix 4 tbs. in 3 cups water and pour this into 
a jar. This makes four servings, 3/4 cup each. Set the jar in the refrigerator 
to get ice cold (this is for convenience and taste only).</p> 
<p> 6:00 PM. Drink one serving (3/4 cup) of the ice cold Epsom salts. If you 
did not prepare this ahead of time, mix 1 tbs. in 3/4 cup water now. You may 
add 1/8 tsp. vitamin C powder to improve the taste. You may also drink a few 
mouthfuls of water afterwards or rinse your mouth.</p> 
<p> Get the olive oil and grapefruit out to warm up. </p> 
<p> 8:00 PM. Repeat by drinking another 3/4 cup of Epsom salts. </p> 
<p> You haven't eaten since two o'clock, but you won't feel hungry. Get your 
bedtime chores done. The timing is critical for success; don't be more than 10 
minutes early or late.</p> 
<p> 9:45 PM. Pour 1/2 cup (measured) olive oil into the pint jar. Squeeze the 
grapefruit by hand into the measuring cup. Remove pulp with fork. You should 
have at least 1/2 cup, more (up to 3/4 cup) is best. You may top it up with 
lemonade. Add this to the olive oil. Close the jar tightly with the lid and 
shake hard until watery (only fresh grapefruit juice does this).</p> 
<p> Now visit the bathroom one or more times, even if it makes you late for 
your ten o'clock drink. Don't be more than 15 minutes late.</p> 
<p> 10:00 PM. Drink the potion you have mixed. Take 4 ornithine capsules with 
the first sips to make sure you will sleep through the night. Take 8 if you 
already suffer from insomnia. Drinking through a large plastic straw helps it 
go down easier. You may use ketchup, cinnamon, or brown sugar to chase it down 
between sips. Take it to your bedside if you want, but drink it standing up. 
Get it down within 5 minutes (fifteen minutes for very elderly or weak persons).
</p> 
<p> Lie down immediately. You might fail to get stones out if you don't. The 
sooner you lie down the more stones you will get out. Be ready for bed ahead of 
time. Don't clean up the kitchen. As soon as the drink is down walk to your bed 
and lie down flat on your back with your head up high on the pillow. Try to 
think about what is happening in the liver. Try to keep perfectly still for at 
least 20 minutes. You may feel a train of stones traveling along the bile ducts 
like marbles. There is no pain because the bile duct valves are open (thank you 
Epsom salts!). Go to sleep, you may fail to get stones out if you don't.</p> 
<p> Next morning. Upon awakening take your third dose of Epsom salts. If you 
have indigestion or nausea wait until it is gone before drinking the Epsom 
salts. You may go back to bed. Don't take this potion before 6:00 am.</p> 
<p> 2 Hours Later. Take your fourth (the last) dose of Epsom salts. Drink 3/4 
cup of the mixture. You may go back to bed.</p> 
<p> After 2 More Hours you may eat. Start with fruit juice. Half an hour later 
eat fruit. One hour later you may eat regular food but keep it light. By supper 
you should feel recovered.</p> 
<p> How well did you do? Expect diarrhea in the morning. Use a flashlight to 
look for gallstones in the toilet with the bowel movement. Look for the green 
kind since this is proof that they are genuine gallstones, not food residue. 
Only bile from the liver is pea green. The bowel movement sinks but gallstones 
float because of the cholesterol inside. Count them all roughly, whether tan or 
green. You will need to total 2000 stones before the liver is clean enough to 
rid you of allergies or bursitis or upper back pains permanently. The first 
cleanse may rid you of them for a few days, but as the stones from the rear 
travel forward, they give you the same symptoms again. You may repeat cleanses 
at two week intervals. Never cleanse when you are ill.</p> 
<p> Sometimes the bile ducts are full of cholesterol crystals that did not 
form into round stones. They appear as a &quot;chaff&quot; floating on top of 
the toilet bowl water. It may be tan colored, harboring millions of tiny white 
crystals. Cleansing this chaff is just as important as purging stones.</p> 
<p> How safe is the liver cleanse? It is very safe. My opinion is based on 
over 500 cases, including many persons in their seventies and eighties. None 
went to the hospital; none even reported pain. However it can make you feel 
quite ill for one or two days afterwards, although in every one of these cases 
the maintenance parasite program had been neglected. This is why the 
instructions direct you to complete the parasite and kidney rinse programs 
first.</p> 
<pre> <b> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++CONGRATULATIONS: +++ +++You 
have taken out your gallstones without surgery! I like +++to think I have 
perfected this recipe, but I certainly can not take +++credit for its origin. 
It was invented hundreds, if not thousands, +++of years ago, THANK YOU, 
HERBALISTS ! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</b> </pre> 
<p> This procedure contradicts many modern medical viewpoints. Gallstones are 
thought to be formed in the gallbladder, not the liver. They are thought to be 
few, not thousands. They are not linked to pains other than gallbladder 
attacks. It is easy to understand why this is thought: by the time you have 
acute pain attacks, some stones are in the gallbladder, are big enough and 
sufficiently calcified to see on X-ray, and have caused inflammation there. 
When the gallbladder is removed the acute attacks are gone, but the bursitis 
and other pains and digestive problems remain.</p> 
<p> The truth is self-evident. People who have had their gallbladder 
surgically removed still get plenty of green, bile-coated stones, and anyone 
who cares to dissect their stones can see that the concentric circles and 
crystals of cholesterol match textbook pictures of &quot;gallstones&quot; 
exactly.</p> 
<h3> Lugol's Iodine Solution </h3> 
<p> It is too dangerous to buy a commercially prepared solution. It is certain 
to be polluted with propyl alcohol or wood alcohol. Make it yourself or ask 
your pharmacist to make it up for you. The recipe to make 1 liter (quart) is:
</p> 
<pre> - 44 gm (1 s/2 ounces) iodine, granular - 88 gm (3 ounces) potassium 
iodide, granular</pre> 
<p> Dissolve the potassium iodide in about a pint of the water. Then add the 
iodine crystals and fill to the liter mark with water. It takes about 1 day to 
dissolve completely. Shake it from time to time. Keep out of sight and reach of 
children. Do not use if allergic to iodine. Be careful to avoid bottled water 
for preparation.</p> 
<h3> Vitamin D Drops </h3> 
<pre> - 1 gram cholecalciferol (see Sources) - 10 cups olive oil </pre> 
<p> Mix in a non-metal container. It may take a day of standing to dissolve 
fully. Refrigerate. Ten drops contain 40,000 iu. Use within a year.</p> 
<h1> Finale </h1> 
<p> I hope you have come to the same happy conclusion that I did a few years 
ago! That we humans don't have hundreds of different maladies and disturbances. 
We only have two! Things that crawl or climb into us. And toxins: unnatural 
chemicals that we unknowingly inhale or consume.</p> 
<p> The living things are both large and small: from worms we can see, to 
microscopic bacteria, viruses and fungi. The non living things are pollutants 
in our air, food, dental metal and body products. Taking in a lot of pollutants 
hampers the body's ability to kill and get rid of the invaders. And so, 
gradually, as we get older or sicker, the body's invaders get the upper hand 
and take over. Don't be discouraged if you have lupus, cerebral palsy, 
cirrhosis, or any complex-sounding disease. Every disease is an example of the 
same process.</p> 
<p> The good news is that our body can reclaim its sovereignty by throwing the 
rascals out. We must assist by throwing the pollutants out. Fortunately, we 
don't have to do the whole job ourselves, we only need to assist. Our body has 
miraculous powers to clean itself up.</p> 
<p> By reducing chronic disease to two problems, it becomes manageable. Ill 
health, even aging, can be reversed. Health comes back and rewards you.</p> 
<p> With the new electronic insights and technology, our parasitic invaders 
can be vanquished with the closing of a switch. Preventing reinfection is the 
bigger challenge. Similarly, pollutants can be uncovered in as short a time as 
days, short enough to turn any sick, even terminal, sufferer's verdict around 
before tragedy occurs.</p> 
<p> The tragedies of surgery, organ replacements, radiation, chemotherapies, 
doses of drugs, even death can be avoided. Reversing illness and turning into a 
shining example of your former healthy self could be the most exciting 
adventure of your life.</p> 
<p> Killing your invaders is an easy matter: you simply purchase or build the 
device that can do that and take the proper herbs. Cleaning up dentalware is 
under your control, too - a financial expense not beyond your reach, hopefully. 
Trading your body products for unpolluted varieties is a job but not 
insurmountable. Cleaning your environment may be the stumbling block. If you 
can't unpollute your air, water, carpets, furniture, move. Move to a healthier 
dwelling! Get rid of it all. Like a cat that moves her kittens to a safer 
place, just move.</p> 
<p> The healthiest house is no house. If you have been quite ill, move far 
enough south to avoid heating and cooling. Sit outside in the shade all day. 
Use your new wisdom and sharp eye to choose a new dwelling as free of 
pollutants as you can. No refrigerator indoors. No window air conditioner. No 
fiberglass insulation. No fossil fuels. No attached garage. No carpets or 
stuffed furniture, no foam bedding, no fresh paint, no pesticide. Go primitive. 
Health is primitive. You were born primitive - with health. Even if you 
weren't, you can undo much of the &quot;inherited&quot; damage.</p> 
<p> Don't listen to the new doomsayers, who persuade you nothing can be done 
unless a gene is replaced. Your genes have been reliable for millions of years. 
Genes are the most reliable of all biological chemicals in your body. They are 
not faulty. They are hampered in their tasks. They are commandeered by metals 
and other species' genes. Those of parasites, bacteria, and viruses. They 
wouldn't be there if pollutants weren't there. They allow invaders into the 
most jealously guarded recess of your being: your genes. But now you can throw 
the rascals out and reclaim your territory. It is not new genes that you need. 
You simply need your own genes back on the job, directed by your own body, 
working for you.</p>
