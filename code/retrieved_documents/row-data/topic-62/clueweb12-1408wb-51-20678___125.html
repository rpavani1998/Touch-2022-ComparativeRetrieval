<h2>Kitchen and Bath Best Design Practices</h2> 
<p>As noted in Chapter 6 of Best Practices Guide to Residential Construction:
</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Design Basics</h3> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Kitchen Design Principles <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong>Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p>Whether designing a small galley kitchen or an expansive space for multiple 
cooks and entertaining, the same rules apply regarding clearances and 
relationships between key work centers so that work in the kitchen flows 
smoothly and efficiently.</p> 
<p>While the traditional American kitchen developed around three main 
appliances&acirc;&#128;&#148;the sink, range, and 
refrigerator&acirc;&#128;&#148;today&rsquo;s kitchen may have many more centers 
of activity, including the following list adapted from the National Kitchen and 
Bath Association (NKBA):</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Primary clean-up center</strong>: Includes the main sink, 
dishwasher, recycling center, and waste disposer.</li> 
<li><strong>Secondary sink center</strong>: May also serve cleanup functions. 
Often associated with the food preparation center.</li> 
<li><strong>Food preparation center</strong>: A clear space at least 16x36 
inches typically located between the sink and cooktop or sink and refrigerator. 
A two-cook kitchen requires two such spaces.</li> 
<li><strong>Cooking center</strong>: Revolves around the cooktop and may also 
include a separate built-in oven or microwave.</li> 
<li><strong>Microwave center</strong>: Because of its frequent use, this 
should be near the main activity areas.</li> 
<li><strong>Pantry center</strong>: Tall storage cabinets work well to store 
food and cooking supplies near the preparation area. Tall cabinets may also 
store dishes in the serving or dining area.</li> 
<li><strong>Serving center</strong>: This area stores dishes and other serving 
items and may be in the kitchen or closer to the dining area.</li> 
<li><strong>Dining center</strong>: Many kitchens include either an eating 
counter or a separate dining area.</li> 
<li><strong>Socializing center</strong>: A casual seating area adjacent to the 
kitchen work space allows other family members or friends to visit and 
socialize with the cook.</li> 
<li><strong>Home office center</strong>: A space for the telephone, mail, 
household records, and cookbooks is often incorporated into the kitchen. 
Concealing the desktop visually from the kitchen is appreciated by many 
clients. (List adapted with permission from John Wiley &amp; Sons from 
Essential Kitchen Design Guide, &copy; NKBA, 1996.)</li> </ul> 
<h2>Kitchen Design Guidelines</h2> 
<p> In 1992, the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) introduced new 
design guidelines based on research conducted at the University of Minnesota. 
These have been expanded and revised over time to reflect the continuing 
evolution of kitchen design and usage.</p> 
<p>The key kitchen design rules are shown below. Accessibility recommendations 
are listed separately here, but they are now incorporated into all NKBA 
guidelines.</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Walkways and Kitchen Work Aisles</h3> 
<p>Work aisles with counters or appliances on both sides should be at least 42 
inches wide for a one-cook kitchen and 48 inches wide for a two-cook kitchen. 
Walkways, which may have a work counter on one side, should be at least 36 
inches wide and should not cross the work triangle (seeFigure 6-1). </p> 
<h3>Kitchen Work Triangle Specifications</h3> 
<p>The shortest walking distance between the refrigerator, primary sink, and 
primary cooktop should be 26 feet or less, as shown inFigure 6-1 above. Each 
leg of the triangle should range from 4 to 9 feet long. No major walkway should 
pass though the triangle, and no corner of an island or peninsula should 
intersect the triangle by more than 12 inches.</p> 
<h3>Two-Cook Kitchen Work Triangles</h3> 
<p>In a two-cook kitchen, each person should have his or her own work triangle 
of less than 26 feet. The two triangles may share a leg, but they should not 
cross one another (Figure 6-2).</p> 
<h3>Conflicting Kitchen Entry, Appliance, Cabinet Doors</h3> 
<p>All entry doors, appliance doors, and cabinet doors should swing freely 
without interfering with another door.</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Cabinet Frontage Recommendations</h3> 
<p>Provide the minimum cabinet frontage shown in Table 6-1 below. Do not count 
difficult-to-reach wall cabinets over hoods or refrigerators unless special 
access is provided.</p> 
<p>A pie-cut lazy Susan base counts as 30 inches. Tall cabinets 72 inches or 
higher can count as either base or wall cabinets as follows: for 12-inch-deep 
cabinets, multiply frontage by one to count as base cabinets and by 2 to count 
as wall cabinets. Double these amounts for 21- to 24-inch-deep tall cabinets.
</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Counter Heights and Edge Specifications</h3> 
<p>Provide at least two counter heights in the kitchen with one 28 to 36 
inches high and the other 36 to 45 inches high. Varied heights create work 
spaces for various tasks and for cooks of different heights, including seated 
cooks. Also, clip or round over countertop corners and edges to eliminate sharp 
edges.</p> 
<h3>Dishwasher Work Center Location</h3> 
<p>Locate the dishwasher within 36 inches of the sink and allow at least 21 
inches of clearance between the dishwasher and any counters, cabinets, or 
appliances placed at a right angle to the dishwasher. If possible, allow 30 
inches of clear floor space on each side of the dishwasher so two people can 
work at the same time (Figure 6-3).</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Sink Work Center Location</h3> 
<p>Locate the primary sink between or across from the cooking surface, food 
preparation area, or refrigerator (Figure 6-4). </p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Counter space</strong>: Allow 24 inches on one side of the sink 
and 18 inches on the other. If the sink is within 3 to 18 inches of a corner, 
provide at least 21 inches of additional space on the return counter.</li> 
<li><strong>Cabinet space</strong>: Provide at least 60 inches of wall cabinet 
frontage within 72 inches of the primary sink centerline. Alternate: Use one 
tall cabinet within 72 inches of the sink.</li> 
<li><strong>Floor space</strong>: A 30x48&acirc;&#128;&#147;inch floor space 
centered in front of the sink will make it wheelchair accessible. Secondary 
Sinks. Provide a minimum of 3 inches of countertop frontage on one side of a 
secondary sink and at least 18 inches on the other side.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Food Preparation Area Specifications</h3> 
<p>Provide 36 inches of continuous countertop, at least 16 inches deep, 
immediately adjacent to a sink. For a two-cook kitchen, provide either two 
separate 36-inch spaces or one 72-inch space adjacent to a sink (seeFigure 6-5).
</p> 
<h3>Recycling Center Area Specifications for Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Unless provided elsewhere in the plan, provide at least two waste 
receptacles in the kitchen, one for garbage and one for recyclables.</p> 
<h3>Cooktop Work Center Design Specifications</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Counter space:</strong> Provide 15 inches on one side of the 
cooktop and 9 inches on the other. Or if placed against an end wall, leave at 
least 3 inches of clearance to the wall and cover it with a flame-retardant 
material. Where there is no backsplash, as in an island or peninsula, provide a 
minimum of 9 inches behind the cooktop for safety reasons (Figure 6-6).</li> 
<li><strong>Clearances</strong>: Allow at least 24 inches of clearance between 
a cooking surface and a protected surface above, such as a range hood, or 30 
inches to an unprotected surface.</li> 
<li><strong>Ventilation</strong>: Ventilate all major appliance cooking 
surfaces with a minimum 150 cfm exhaust fan. Gas appliances must vent to the 
exterior.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Oven Landing Space Needed in Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Provide at least 15 inches of landing space, a minimum of 16 inches deep, 
next to or above the oven. If the oven does not open into a traffic area, the 
landing space can be directly across from the oven by no more than 48 inches.
</p> 
<h3>Microwave Work Center Measurements</h3> 
<p>Locate stand-alone microwave ovens so that the bottom of the appliance is 
24 to 48 inches above the floor. Provide at least 15 inches of landing space, a 
minimum of 16 inches deep above, below, or to the side of the microwave oven.
</p> 
<h3>Refrigerator Work Center Specifications</h3> 
<p>Provide at least 15 inches of counter space as a &ldquo;landing area&rdquo; 
adjacent to the handle side of the refrigerator or on both sides of a 
side-by-side refrigerator. Alternately, provide 15 inches of countertop 
directly across from the refrigerator and no more than 48 inches away. With a 
side-by-side unit, provide easy access to a counter from the fresh food side (
Figure 6-7).</p> 
<h3>Overlapping Work Centers</h3> 
<p>Where countertop areas of two work centers (e.g., sink, refrigerator, food 
preparation) overlap, the minimum counter frontage between the centers should 
equal the longest of the required two lengths plus 12 inches.</p> 
<h3>Tall Cabinets Between Work Centers</h3> 
<p>Do not separate two primary work centers (primary sink, refrigerator, 
preparation area, or cooking center) by a full-height, full depth tower such as 
an oven cabinet, pantry cabinet, or refrigerator. One exception is a 
corner-recessed tall tower if knee space is planned to one side.</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Eating Area Design Specifications</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Eating counter heights</strong>. Heights and capacities for 
tables, eating counters, and bars are shown inFigure 6-8. Seating widths have 
been increased to 30 inches in the 30-inch-high seating area to accommodate 
wheelchairs.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Clearances to walls</strong>. Allow a minimum clearance of 36 
inches from the edge of a counter or table to a wall or obstruction. Increase 
this to 65 inches if the space also serves as a walkway (Figure 6-9).</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li><strong>Table sizes</strong>. Many kitchens feature small or full-size 
dining tables (Table 6-1). When selecting a table, pay close attention to 
whether leg placement will interfere with the number of chairs planned.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Kitchen Wiring for Use of Electrical Devices</h3> 
<p>Install ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) on all receptacles within 
the kitchen. Locate wall-mounted room controls, including electrical 
receptacles, switches, thermostats, telephones, and intercoms, between 15 to 48 
inches above the finished floor.</p> 
<h3>Home Kitchen Fire Protection Advice</h3> 
<p>A fire extinguisher should be visibly located in the kitchen away from 
cooking equipment and 15 to 48 inches above the floor. Smoke alarms should be 
installed near the kitchen.</p> 
<h3>Natural Lighting for Kitchens</h3> 
<p>The combined area of windows and skylights should equal at least 10% of the 
square footage of the kitchen. Also, every work surface should be well 
illuminated by appropriate task or general lighting. (seeKitchen Lighting 
Requirements).</p> 
<h2>Typical Kitchen Layouts</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Kitchen Layouts, Typical <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p> Kitchen plans should follow the work flow from the garage or side entrance 
where food enters the home to the storage area or refrigerator. From there, 
work typically flows to the sink and food prep area, then on to the cooktop or 
oven, and eating area.</p> 
<p>Finally, dishes move back to the sink and dishwasher for clean up. All 
kitchens from the simplest to most complex should be designed to smoothly 
accommodate this basic workflow (seeFigure 6-10).</p> 
<h3>Single-Wall Kitchen Layout</h3> 
<p>The simplest kitchen plan is designed for one cook and primarily used in 
small apartments. If the kitchen has a second wall, use it for storage with 
pegboards or shelving narrow enough to leave adequate clearance.</p> 
<h3>Galley Kitchen Layout</h3> 
<p>A corridor or galley-style kitchen can provide an efficient layout for a 
single cook. If household traffic must regularly pass through, provide at least 
48 inches of clearance between counters.</p> 
<h3>L-Shaped Kitchen Design Layout</h3> 
<p>This layout provides adequate counter space and creates an efficient work 
triangle away from the household traffic flow. The large open space can often 
accommodate a dining area.</p> 
<h3>U-Shaped Kitchen Plan</h3> 
<p>Many designers consider this the most efficient plan, since the cook is 
surrounded on three sides by countertop, work centers, and storage areas. Also, 
household traffic is naturally directed around the work area, keeping it clear 
for kitchen tasks.</p> 
<h3>L-Shaped Kitchen Layout with Island</h3> 
<p>This combines the compact efficiency of a U-shaped plan with the benefits 
of a more open plan. The island invites interaction between the cook and 
visitors or helpers because more than one person can work at the open counter.
</p> 
<h2>Accessible Kitchen Design Recommendations</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Kitchen Design, Accessible <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong>Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p> To make a kitchen fully functional for wheelchair users and other seated 
occupants requires simple commonsense changes, like placing knobs within reach, 
as well as more significant changes, such as lowering counters and providing 
knee space below. The guidelines below, based on ANSI (American National 
Standards Institute) A117.1 standards, are a good starting point in design, but 
they should be tailored to the size, reach, and specific capabilities of the 
occupants.</p> 
<h3>Work Aisles and Passageways in Accessible Kitchen Design</h3> 
<p>Clear space at doorways and passageways must be at least 32 inches wide and 
no more than 24 inches long in the direction of travel. Eliminate any 
thresholds at doorways.</p> 
<p>The minimum work aisle with counters or appliances on both sides should be 
40 inches. Walkways with counters or appliances on only one side can be 36 
inches wide, but if a walkway turns a corner, as inFigure 6-1 , one leg should 
be widened to 42 inches for a wheelchair to make the turn.</p> 
<p> From a table or eating counter to a wall, leave 54 inches for wheelchair 
access. In a U-shaped kitchen the minimum clearance between counters is 60 
inches (Figure 6-11).</p> 
<h3>Knee Space Requirements for Accessible Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Wherever possible, provide knee space for a seated user below or adjacent 
to sinks, cooktops, ranges, dishwashers, refrigerators, and ovens. To 
accommodate a seated user, below-counter knee space should be a minimum of 30 
inches wide, 27 inches high in front, and 19 inches deep, with a minimum 
9-inch-high toe space, which will accommodate most wheelchair footrests. 
Protect users from exposed pipes and mechanicals with a protective panel and 
insulation (Figure 6-12).</p> 
<h3>Clear Floor Space Needs for Accessible Kitchens</h3> 
<p> To make work centers universally accessible, provide a clear floor space 
of 30x48 inches or 48x30 inches, centered in front of the sink, dishwasher, 
cooktop, oven, and refrigerator. These floor spaces may overlap, and the long 
dimension can include up to 19 inches deep of knee space below counters (Figure 
6-13).</p> 
<h3>Counter and Appliance Height for Accessible Kitchen Designs</h3> 
<p>he optimal height for most seated occupants at counters, sinks, and 
cooktops is about 32 inches and should be no higher than 34 inches.</p> 
<h3>Storage Height Specifications for Accessible Kitchen Designs</h3> 
<p>Most seated users can fully reach shelving located from 15 to 48 inches 
high. Storage located from about 20 to 44 inches is considered optimal. Use 
open shelving, shelf racks on pantry doors, and drawers or roll-out shelving 
for easy access (Figure 6-14).</p> 
<h3>Handles and Control Recommendations for Accessible Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Controls, handles, and door and drawer pulls should be operable with one 
hand, require minimal strength, and not require tight grasping, pinching, or 
twisting of the wrists. Lever-action handles work well for doors and faucets. A 
simple test is to try to operate the controls with a closed fist.</p> 
<p>Mount wall cabinet doors at the bottom of the cabinets and base cabinet 
pulls at the top of the cabinets.</p> 
<h3>Sink and Dishwasher Work Center for Accessible Kitchen Designs</h3> 
<p>Use a shallow sink mounted at 32 to 34 inches (32 preferred) with the drain 
in the rear so it does not interfere with knee space (Figure 6-15). The garbage 
disposal must also be offset so it does not interfere with knee space. A tall 
faucet and pullout spray attachment are recommended to simplify work at the 
sink. Locate the dishwasher adjacent to the sink or no more than 12 inches away.
</p> 
<h3>Lighting Suggestions for Accessible Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Lighting levels should be up to twice normal levels. Using light-colored 
floors, walls, ceilings, and counters will help keep all areas well 
illuminated. Light colors on the insides of cabinets and drawers will help make 
items more visible.</p> 
<h3>Cooking Work Center Suggestions for Accessible Kitchens</h3> 
<p>If possible, place the cooktop and sink on the same wall so users do not 
have to carry heavy pots across the room. Electric cooktops with a smooth 
surface and controls on the front work best so the user does not have to reach 
over the top. Look for units with staggered burners for easier access to back 
burners.</p> 
<p>Use a separate wall-mounted oven, not an under-counter design. An oven with 
a side-hinged door rather than the usual pull-down style works well.</p> 
<h3>Refrigerator Work Center Design for Accessible Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Side-by-side units with doors that swing back a full 180 degrees are 
preferable to up-and-down models. Provide at least 18 inches of counter space 
adjacent to the refrigerator.</p> 
<h2>Bathroom Design Basics</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Bathroom Design Principles <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p> A well-designed bathroom is comfortable to use, safe, durable, and easy to 
clean. Space planning revolves around the main fixtures and their required 
clearances. Proper clearances are critical to avoid problems such as banged 
elbows at a sink placed too close to a wall or difficult access to the tub 
faucet.</p> 
<p>Bathroom safety concerns should be paramount in design decisions and 
material choices. For example, choose only nonskid flooring types and select 
tub and shower controls with foolproof antiscald protection. Avoid designs with 
sunken tubs or tub surrounds with steps, both of which are hazards.</p> 
<p>Details about anti-scald protection and devices are found at MIXING / 
ANTI-SCALD VALVES.</p> 
<p>Also remember that following code is not a guarantee of safety. For 
example, while it is legal to place bathroom lighting circuits downstream from 
the GFCI outlet, it is unwise since anything that trips the GFCI will also 
plunge the bathroom into darkness.</p> 
<h2>Bathroom Design Guidelines</h2> 
<p> The following recommendations are based on guidelines first published by 
the National Kitchen and Bath Association in 1992. While accessible design 
principles are provided separately below, NKBA now incorporates these 
principles into their recommendations for all projects.</p> 
<h3>Lavatories: Sink Clearances, Heights, Measurements</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Clearances</strong>. Locate each sink so its centerline is at 
least 15 inches from a wall and 30 inches from the centerline of a second sink. 
The minimum walkway shown in front of the sink may not allow full accessibility 
(seeFigure 6-16).</li> 
<li><strong>Height</strong>. While the standard vanity or sink height is 30 to 
32 inches, 34 inches is a better compromise between shorter and taller users. 
If a bath has more than one vanity, set one at 30 to 34 inches and the other at 
34 to 42 inches high.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Mirror Height Specifications for Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>The bottom edge of a mirror over a vanity should be no more than 40 inches 
above the floor, or 48 inches if the mirror is tilted forward.</p> 
<h3>Shower Clearances &amp; Measurements for Bathrooms</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Clearances</strong>: Allow a minimum 21-inch walkway (30 inches 
preferred) from the front of the shower stall to a wall or fixture. These 
clearances may not allow full accessibility.</li> 
<li><strong>Size</strong>: Provide a minimum clear floor space inside the 
shower stall of 34x34 inches, preferably 36x36 inches or larger. For optimal 
comfort and safety, increase the size to 36x42 inches to 48 inches, which 
allows space for the user to step out of the stream of water to adjust the 
temperature (Figure 6-17).</li> 
<li><strong>Neoangle Showers</strong>: Neoangle showers are popular space 
savers, but the showering area is reduced in size due to the cut-off corner. 
The size of the corner cut varies from one model to another, with some cutting 
significantly into the shower space. For comfort, neoangles should be at least 
42x42 inches.</li> 
<li><strong>Showerhead Location</strong>: Locate the showerhead supply pipe 72 
to 78 inches above the finished shower floor. The installed showerhead will be 
4 to 6 inches lower. If a handheld showerhead is used, it should be no higher 
than 48 inches at its lowest position.</li> 
<li><strong>Seating in Shower Stalls</strong>: Shower stalls should include a 
bench or seat that is 17 to 19 inches high and a minimum of 15 inches deep. The 
seat should not encroach on the minimum 34x34-inch floor space.</li> 
<li><strong>Doors for Showers</strong>: Shower doors must open into the 
bathroom, not into the shower stall.</li> 
<li>Controls for Showers<strong>: Locate controls 38 to 48 inches off the 
floor and offset toward the room so they are accessible</strong>from both 
inside and outside the fixture.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Bathtub Clearances &amp; Measurements</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Clearances</strong>. Allow a minimum 21-inch walkway (30 inches 
preferred) from the open side of the tub to a wall or fixture. These clearances 
may not allow full accessibility.</li> 
<li><strong>Steps to a tub</strong>. Do not build steps leading to a bathtub 
or raised tub platform. These create a serious hazard. It is much safer for 
users to sit on the lip of the tub or platform and swing their legs in. Sunken 
tubs are also a hazard. Safety rails should be installed to help users get in 
and out of any tub configuration.</li> 
<li><strong>Controls</strong>. Offset controls toward the outside of the tub 
so they are accessible from both inside and outside the fixture. Bathtub 
controls should be no more than 33 inches high. If a handheld showerhead is 
used, it should be no higher than 48 inches at its lowest position (Figure 6-18
).</li> </ul> 
<h3>Antiscald Protection Advice for Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Protect all tubs and showers with a pressure-balancing valve or 
thermostatically controlled valve to limit water temperatures at a faucet or 
showerhead to 120&deg;F or less. Recommend that homeowners set water heaters to 
no more than 120&deg;F as an added precaution. Details about anti-scald 
protection and devices are found atMIXING / ANTI-SCALD VALVES.</p> 
<h3>Toilets and Bidet Layout &amp; Clearances for Bathrooms</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Clearances</strong>. Fifteen inches is the allowable minimum from 
the centerline of toilets and bidets to a fixture or wall, while 17 to 18 
inches will create a more comfortable space (Figure 6-19). Sixteen inches is 
the minimum for full accessibility as long as there is sufficient transfer 
space in front or on the side (see &ldquo;Accessible Bathroom Design,&rdquo; 
below).</li> 
<li><strong>Separate compartment</strong>. Compartmental toilet areas should 
be a minimum of 36x66 inches with a swing-out or pocket door.</li> 
<li><strong>Toilet paper holde</strong>r. Locate with the center 26 inches 
above the floor, about 8 inches forward from the front of the toilet.</li> </ul>
<h3>Flooring Choices &amp; Suggestions for Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Make all bathroom flooring slip-resistant. Ventilation. Provide mechanical 
ventilation to the exterior (see &ldquo;<strong>Bathroom Ventilation</strong>
,&rdquo; for sizing information).</p> 
<h3>Electrical Receptacles for Bathrooms - GFCI Needed</h3> 
<p>All bathroom receptacles must be GFCI protected. All light fixtures above a 
tub or shower must be rated for damp locations (tub) or wet locations (shower). 
Switches must not be reachable from within a tub or shower. Many bathrooms are 
wired so that all the lights go out if a GFCI is tripped. Although this is 
allowed by code, it is neither safe nor convenient for the homeowners.</p> 
<h3>Lighting Suggestions for Baths</h3> 
<p>The vanity area should include both overhead and side lighting. Place side 
lighting centered at eye level (seeBathroom Lighting Guidelines). Where 
possible, provide natural lighting as well from a window or skylight area equal 
to at least 10% of the floor area.</p> 
<h3>Glass Safety Requirements in Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>All glass used in a tub or shower enclosure or other glass applications 
within 18 inches of the floor should be safety glazing, such as laminated 
glass, tempered glass, or an approved plastic.</p> 
<h3>Typical Bathroom Layouts</h3> 
<p> Bathrooms are divided into three main centers of activity: 
lavatory/grooming, toilet/bidet, and bathing/showering. In smaller bathrooms, 
these all share one common space, while in more spacious rooms, the grooming 
area or toilet area may be separated to allow greater flexibility and privacy 
for multiple users.</p> 
<p>Larger spaces also allow for greater storage, such as a linen closet, 
within the bathroom space. Typical bathroom layouts with minimum dimensions for 
comfortable use are shown inFigure 6-20.</p> 
<h2>Accessible Bathroom Design Specifications</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Bathroom Design, Accessible <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p>To make a bathroom fully functional for wheelchair users and other seated 
occupants requires commonsense changes, such as using universal controls and 
placing them within reach, as well as some significant changes, such as 
lowering sinks and providing knee space below.</p> 
<p>In some cases, the room will need to be enlarged to accommodate a roll-in 
shower or to allow room for wheelchair users to reverse direction. The minimum 
guidelines below, based on ANSI Standard A117.1, are a good starting point in 
design, but they should be tailored to the size, reach, and specific 
capabilities of the occupants.</p> 
<h3>Doors and Passageways for Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Clear space at doorways and passageways should be at least 32 inches wide 
and no more than 24 inches long in the direction of travel. Walkways between 
vertical objects (walls, cabinets, fixtures) greater than 24 inches long in the 
direction of travel should be at least 36 inches wide.</p> 
<p>Pocket doors or doors that swing outward are preferred, since they do not 
encroach on bathroom space and will not get blocked in an emergency. Eliminate 
any thresholds at doorways.</p> 
<h3>Lavatory Height and Knee Space for Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>For most seated users, the recommended sink height is 32 inches (Figure 6-21
). Provide knee space at the sink at least 27 inches high at the opening and 19 
inches deep, with adequate toe space. Protect users from exposed pipes and 
mechanicals with insulation and a protective panel.</p> 
<h3>Floor Space at Lavatory in Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Provide a minimum clear floor space of 30x48 inches centered in front of 
the sink either parallel or perpendicular to the sink. Up to 19 inches of the 
48-inch dimension can extend under the sink if knee space is provided (Figure 
6-22).</p> 
<h3>Floor Space at Toilet or Bidet in Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Provide a minimum clearance of 18 inches on either side of the toilet or 
bidet centerline to a wall or fixture. Also provide a minimum 30x48-inch clear 
floor space (preferably 48x48 inches) in front of the toilet or bidet. If 
necessary, the clear floor space may include up to 12 inches of knee space 
under an adjacent sink. Remember that these are minimum clearances. To simplify 
transfers, leave as much free space on one side of the toilet as possible (
Figure 6-23).</p> 
<h3>Floor Space Requirements at Bathtub in Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Provide a minimum clear floor space of 60 inches along the length of the 
tub by 30 inches deep for a parallel approach or by 48 inches deep for a 
perpendicular approach. An additional 12 to 18 inches of clear space beyond 
each end of the tub is also desirable for access to controls and to ease 
transfers (seeFigure 6-24).</p> 
<h3>Floor Space at Shower in Accessible Baths</h3> 
<p>For people who shower standing, provide a minimum 
36x36&acirc;&#128;&#147;inch shower with appropriate grab bars, and provide a 
minimum clear floor space in front, 36 inches deep by the width of the shower 
plus 12 inches. People who cannot leave their wheelchair require wider roll-in 
showers of at least 30x60 inches.</p> 
<p>The minimum access space should be the full length of the shower by 36 
inches. For either type of shower, an additional 12 to 18 inches beyond each 
end is desirable for better access to controls and to ease transfers (Figure 
6-25).</p> 
<h3>Overlapping Floor Spaces in Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Clear floor spaces in front of fixtures may overlap and may include up to 
12 inches deep of knee space below the sink.</p> 
<h3>Turning Space Needed in Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>A bathroom clear space for reversing direction in a wheelchair should be 
either a circle, 60 inches in diameter, or a T-shaped space of 36x36x60 inches 
(seeFigure 6-26).</p> 
<h3>Grab Bar Locations &amp; Installation Requirements for Accessible Bathrooms
</h3> 
<p> These should be installed in the bathtub or shower and toilet areas for 
full accessibility.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Grab Bar Reinforcing</strong>. Reinforce attachment points at the 
time of construction with 3/4-inch plywood or solid 2x6 blocking designed to 
bear a static load of 300 pounds.</li> 
<li><strong>Grab Bar Size</strong>. Grab bars should be from 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 
inches in diameter with a slip-resistant surface and sit 1 1/2 inches away from 
the wall.</li> 
<li><strong>Grab Bar Location</strong>. The optimal location of grab bars will 
depend on the users&rsquo; specific needs, such as whether they will be sitting 
or standing and which types of movements they can and cannot perform. One 
vertical bar placed at the entry point to a shower or bath enclosure is 
generally useful to anyone getting in or out. A horizontal bar on the control 
side is useful for people who stand in the shower.</li> </ul> 
<p>ANSI guidelines for accessible bathrooms specify grab bars at 33 to 36 
inches above the floor. However, accessibility experts often place them higher 
or lower based on an individual&rsquo;s specific needs. In toilet areas, 
install one grab bar behind the toilet and one on the side wall closest to the 
toilet. Some people require grab bars on both sides. ANSI guidelines for toilet 
and tub areas are shown inFigure 6-27.</p> 
<h3>Storage Locations in Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Locate storage for toiletries, linens, and bathroom supplies within 15 to 
48 inches from the floor. Locate towel racks, soap dishes, and other personal 
hygiene items within the same height range.</p> 
<h3>Controls Specifications for Accessible Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>Controls, dispensers, and outlets should be located from 15 to 48 inches 
high, and all devices should be operable with a closed fist. Offset controls in 
showers and tubs toward the room side, as shown inFigure 6-27. This makes them 
easier to reach for all users.</p> 
<h2>Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Flooring Choices &amp; Recommendations</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see Floor Designs: Kitchen &amp; Bathroom f</strong><strong>
or the detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are 
below.</p> 
<p> The leading choices for kitchen and bath flooring installed in new homes 
are sheet vinyl and ceramic tile, chosen for their durability, ease of 
maintenance, and tolerance of water (Figure 6-28 and Figure 6-29). Vinyl offers 
a resilient surface underfoot and is generally less expensive than tile, 
although the high-end vinyl products can cost nearly as much as lower-end tiles.
</p> 
<p>Tile is often chosen for its durability in both wet and dry environments. 
Although a ceramic tile installation is not completely waterproof without the 
addition of a waterproofing membrane, the tile itself, along with the cement 
backerboards and thinset mortars used in quality installations, are unaffected 
by water.</p> 
<p>Hardwood, too, has become popular in kitchens as kitchens have evolved into 
primary centers for recreation and socializing. Although not the most practical 
choice for wet areas or high-traffic zones, new harder finishes make it more 
resistant to scratching and better able to tolerate the occasional wetting.</p> 
<p>The toughest finishes are available only on prefinished flooring, but seams 
between the boards could allow water to penetrate if exposed to standing water 
(seeFLOOR, WOOD FINISHES).</p> 
<p>A satin finish is preferable in a high-traffic area like a kitchen, since 
it shows scratches less than a glossy finish. With any wood floor, the 
homeowners should wipe up spills quickly and use water sparingly when cleaning.
</p> 
<p>For consumers seeking a resilient walking surface but reluctant to use 
vinyl for environmental or health reasons, newer options include a variety of 
cork products, newly introduced lines of traditional linoleum, and a variety of 
laminated bamboo products that perform essentially the same as solid hardwood 
flooring. With proper installation and care, any of these materials can provide 
a durable, attractive floor in a kitchen.</p> 
<p> In a bath, the best option is a waterproof surface with few joints or 
seams to allow water penetration (Table 6-3).</p>

<p> A quality ceramic tile job starts with proper framing to support the tile 
and the selection of tile materials that are right for the application and 
compatible with each other.</p> 
<p>The substructure must be stiff enough to support the tile without excess 
movement or deflection, and the tile, backerboard, adhesive, grout, and any 
waterproofing membrane must be compatible with one another. If all these 
products are installed following the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions as well 
as the specifications of the Tile Council of America (TCA), the result should 
be an attractive and durable job.</p> 
<p>Finally, it is critical that the installer leave the required expansion 
joints at the room perimeter, tub lips, and other places the tile is 
restrained&acirc;&#128;&#148;the source of many tile callbacks.</p> 
<h3>Selecting Tile for Kitchens &amp; Baths</h3> 
<p> A wide array of tiles are readily available. In addition to aesthetic 
concerns, tiles vary in strength, water absorption, scratch resistance, ease of 
cleaning, and slip resistance.</p> 
<p>In general, look for harder tiles for floor and counter applications, and 
tiles low in water absorption for wet applications. Beyond looking at the 
specifications, it is a good idea to test a sample of tile for scratch 
resistance, scuffing, and ease of cleaning, using real pots and pans, shoes, 
and household cleansers.</p> 
<h3>Strength and Water Absorption of Ceramic Tiles</h3> 
<p>The body of a ceramic tile, also called the bisque, is made by heating a 
mixture of clay and other additives in a kiln. In general, the longer the clay 
is fired and the higher the temperature, the denser and stronger the tile will 
be and the more impervious to water absorption.</p> 
<p>Nonporous tiles that absorb little water will perform better in wet 
applications than porous tiles. The tile bisques manufactured according to ANSI 
standards are rated from nonvitreous to impervious (seeTable 6-4).</p> 
<h3>Comparison of the Properties of Glazed vs. Unglazed Ceramic Tile</h3> 
<p>With the exception of quarry tile, terra-cotta, and some porcelains and 
mosaics, most tiles come glazed. The glaze consists of a mix of silica and 
pigments that is fused to the surface of the tile at high temperatures, 
creating a glasslike coating.</p> 
<p>Glazes provide decorative color and protect the surface of porous tiles 
from absorbing water and stains. How well a glaze resists abrasion and shows 
scratches depends on several factors:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Glazes fired hotter and longer tend to be 
harder and more scratch-resistant.</li> 
<li><strong>Color</strong>: Light-colored glazes tend to be harder than dark 
colors and conceal scratches better.</li> 
<li><strong>Gloss level</strong>: Matte-finished glazes tend to be harder than 
high gloss and also conceal scratches better.</li> </ul> 
<p>Unglazed tiles show the natural color of the clay, although some unglazed 
mosaics have pigment added to the clay. Unglazed tiles may need to be sealed to 
prevent staining during grouting or in use on floors, counters, and other 
applications prone to staining. Sealing is generally done before grouting. If 
used on a counter, make sure the sealer is suitable for use around food.</p> 
<p>Many manufacturers now rate the abrasion resistance of their tile using the 
guidelines of the Porcelain Enamel Institute (PEI). The PEI system rates tiles 
from 1 to 5 as shown inTable 6-5. Select Grade 3 or higher where scratching of 
the tile surface is a concern.</p> 
<h3>Slip Protection vs. Use of Glazed Tiles in Baths or Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Many glazed floor tiles become dangerously slippery when wet. This is a 
concern wherever floors are subject to wetting, but particularly on shower 
floors and bathroom floors near tubs and showers. In general, unglazed tiles or 
textured patterns will be less slippery. Some tile has a special nonskid 
surface made by adding an abrasive grit to the tile face or glaze. The downside 
is that nonglossy surfaces are somewhat harder to keep clean.</p> 
<p>Many tile manufacturers use a coefficient of friction (COF) to rate the 
traction a tile provides. While there are no national standards that specify a 
required COF, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) recommends a minimum 
COF of .60 on accessible walking routes.</p> 
<p>Experts also recommend a minimum COF of .60 for shower stalls, wet bathroom 
floors, and other wet areas.</p> 
<h2>Guide to Ceramic, Stone, &amp; Other Tile Types</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Floor, Stone, Granite, Marble, Agglomer 
<strong>for the detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> 
Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p> A wide variety of man-made synthetic and natural tiles are available (
Table 6-6). Most fall into one of the categories described below:</p> 
<h3>Glazed Ceramic Tile Properties</h3> 
<p>The most common type of tile, glazed ceramic tile, is usually marketed as 
either a wall or floor tile, depending on the hardness and water-absorption of 
the underlying clay body of the tile or bisque. Wall tiles are typically 1/4 
inch thick and range in size from 4x4 to 12x12 inches.</p> 
<p>Floor tiles are generally thicker and are available in sizes up to 13x13 
inches and larger. Some floor tiles may also have a slip-resistant surface, 
which is advisable in a bathroom. A tile sold for use on floors will not 
necessarily have a hard scratch-resistant glaze, however.</p> 
<p>Where tile scratching is a concern, such as in kitchens and entryways, look 
for a PEI rating of 3 or higher, or test the scratch resistance of the tile 
yourself with a cooking utensil or other abrasives the tile might face in 
service.</p> 
<h3>Porcelain Tile Characteristics</h3> 
<p>Porcelain tile is fired at high temperatures, creating a dense and strong 
material that is impervious to water absorption. The tile has a smooth texture 
and sharply formed face. Small imperfections in size due to the high firing 
temperatures give it a less formal look than standard tiles.</p> 
<p>Porcelain tile is available unglazed or glazed with a matte or high-gloss 
finish, and comes in a wide variety of sizes, colors, and shapes. Small 
1x1&acirc;&#128;&#147;inch porcelain tiles are commonly used on shower and 
bathroom floors. These are usually mounted in sheets to simplify installation. 
Because porcelain is impervious to water absorption and because the mounting 
sheet can interfere with the bond, it should be installed with a 
polymer-modified thinset mortar made for use with porcelain.</p> 
<h3>Mosaic Tile Properties</h3> 
<p>Mosaic refers to any hard, dense tile, such as porcelain, vitreous clay, or 
glass, that is typically one inch square. Porcelain mosaics are usually 
unglazed and are colored by adding pigment directly to the clay. Because it is 
tough and durable, mosaic tile can work well on just about any application, 
including floors, shower stalls, and counters. Generally mosaics are mounted in 
sheets and should be installed with latex-modified thinset mortar (Figure 6-30).
</p> 
<h3>Paver Tiles Properties</h3> 
<p>Machine-made pavers are 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and are available glazed or 
unglazed. They are usually made from semivitreous or vitreous clay or 
impervious porcelain, making them suitable for outdoor use. The glazes used on 
machine-made paver tiles tend to be very hard and well suited to floors and 
countertops.</p> 
<p>Handmade pavers, on the other hand, tend to be relatively soft, unglazed, 
nonvitreous tiles, so they are not suitable for wet interior applications or 
outdoors in areas subject to freeze/thaw cycles. Handmade pavers are generally 
made in Mexico from yellow or brown terra cotta and come in various shapes and 
sizes.</p> 
<p> Because they are handmade, they have uneven faces and vary in color and 
texture from tile to tile, giving a floor a rustic appearance (Figure 6-31).</p>
<p>Handmade paver tiles may come prefinished or require sealing by the 
installer with either a surface coating or penetrating sealer to provide a wear 
surface. Penetrating sealers have the advantage of easy refinishing of worn 
spots, whereas surface coatings need to be stripped before being reapplied.</p> 
<p>Apply any sealers before grouting. All pavers should be set with a thinset 
adhesive. Because of their irregular shapes, the individual tiles may need to 
be &ldquo;back-buttered&rdquo; to provide full support and contact with the 
substrate material.</p> 
<h3>Quarry Tile Characteristics</h3> 
<p>Originally made from quarried stone, quarry tiles are typically unglazed, 
semivitreous or vitreous tiles made from extruded slabs of clay or shale. They 
are 3/8 to 3/4 inch thick and come in a variety of square and rectangular 
shapes. They range in color from gray to browns and reds, depending on the type 
of clay and firing temperature.</p> 
<p>These dense, thick tiles have through-color, making them very durable and 
suitable for heavy traffic as well as wet or exterior applications. The tiles 
will stain, however, so they should be sealed with surface sealers where that 
is a concern (the material is too dense for penetrating oil sealers). Since 
most surface sealers are not suitable for food contact, quarry tile is not a 
good choice for counters where staining is a concern. Installation should be 
with thinset adhesive.</p> 
<h3>Natural Stone Tiles Characteristics</h3> 
<p> Stone and agglomerate stone tiles are popular choices in kitchens and 
baths due to their durability and natural beauty. Stone tiles typically measure 
from 3/8 to over 1 inch thick, making some 12-inch square tiles weigh over 10 
pounds. The most common stones are marble and granite, since they both can take 
a high polish.</p> 
<p>Of the two, granite is much more durable and stain-resistant, and is 
unharmed by mild acids that will etch marble and limestone. Granite is stained 
by oil and grease, however. All natural stones are subject to staining if they 
are not sealed when installed and resealed whenever water does not bead up on 
the surface.</p> 
<p>Most customers prefer a highly polished finish on natural stone in the 
kitchen or bath. A polished finish offers some protection against stains but 
can also make floors slippery and requires maintenance to preserve the sheen.
</p> 
<p>On kitchen floors, polished stone will eventually lose its sheen in 
high-traffic areas, unless protective coatings and sealers are applied 
regularly. Softer and more porous stones, such as limestone and sandstones, are 
prone to excess wear and staining and are rarely used in kitchens and baths.</p>
<p>On any stone floor, sand, dirt, and grit do the most damage due to their 
abrasiveness. Commonsense approaches, such as entry mats to clean shoes and 
frequent dusting with a dry mop, will go a long way toward preserving the stone 
surface.</p> 
<h3>Installation Procedures for Stone Tiles</h3> 
<p>Installation of stone tile is essentially the same as with ceramic tile 
except for the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Deflection of substrate</strong>. Some of the softer stones, such 
as marble and limestone, require a stiffer floor than the L/360 required for 
ceramic tile. To meet the stiffer load requirements of L/720 or L/1020, floor 
joists must be upsized or located closer together. A thicker or double-layer 
subfloor may also be required.</li> 
<li><strong>Compatibility with setting materials</strong>. Porous and 
light-colored stone tiles may be stained or discolored by certain grouts, 
adhesives, or sealants. With light colored or translucent stone tiles, it is 
best to use a white thinset rather than the more common gray type. Also, 
colored grouts, plumber&rsquo;s putty, and some caulks will stain 
lighter-colored stones and porous stones. It is best to test a sample for 
compatibility before installation.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Marble and Limestone Tile Use &amp; Installation Advice for Kitchens &amp; 
Baths</h3> 
<p>Both marble and limestone are carbonates, made from ancient shells, sand, 
and mud, although marbles have been additionally heated and squeezed until 
crystallized.</p> 
<p>Marbles tend to be denser and less porous than limestones and can take a 
high polish, but both materials are relatively soft and will etch with mild 
acids (lemon juice, vinegar), making them unsuitable for kitchen counters 
unless a rustic appearance is acceptable. Darker stones will etch more 
noticeably. Limestones and softer marbles are not suitable for floors either.
</p> 
<p>Marble comes in a wide variety of colors and levels of quality, ranging 
from Grade A with few to no flaws or voids to Grade D, which has a large 
proportion of flaws, voids, veins, and lines of separation that need to be 
repaired with fillers and adhesives during fabrication of the tiles. A 
fiberglass mesh may also be laminated to the back to provide stability. Some of 
the most highly prized colored marbles are the least stable.</p> 
<p>Tiles are available either polished or honed. Polished marble is suitable 
for walls or bathroom floors, but the polish will generally not hold up well on 
kitchen floors or countertops due to wear and tear and mild acid spills.</p> 
<p>Although worn marble can be cleaned and re polished, a nonglossy honed 
finish is a better choice for kitchen floors and counters. The honed finish 
must be sealed to prevent permanent staining of the porous marble.</p> 
<p>Dark green marble, called serpentine, is actually a much harder silicate. 
It will not etch but has a tendency to warp when wet, so it should not be 
installed in wet areas or exposed to standing water when cleaned. When 
installing serpentine, epoxy-based mortars and adhesives are preferable to 
water- or latex-based products. Pre sealers, applied before grouting, help 
prevent stains and simplify cleanup, particularly with non polished finishes.
</p> 
<h3>Granite Tile Choices &amp; Installation Advice for Kitchens or Baths</h3> 
<p>Granite is a hard, granular igneous rock that contains mostly quartz and 
feldspars and ranges in color from pink and red to light or dark gray or a mix 
of these. It is generally uniform in color and has high compressive strength 
and abrasion resistance. It has very low absorption, but some types, especially 
the popular swirl types (technically called gneiss), are subject to staining if 
not sealed. Common finishes include polished, honed, or thermal.</p> 
<p>Polished granite tiles are suitable for kitchen and bath walls, floors, or 
countertops. While granite holds its polish longer than marble and is not 
bothered by mild acids, such as orange juice or vinegar, over time the traffic 
on a kitchen floor will dull the finish. Use of doormats and frequent sweeping 
to remove abrasives from the floor will help prolong the finish. Re polishing 
the granite tends to be expensive due to the hardness of the material.</p> 
<p>Waxing and special coatings may help protect the polished finish, but 
frequent stripping and reapplication can, by itself, cause excessive wear.</p> 
<p>Another option for floors are honed or thermal finished granite tiles, 
which are more commonly used outdoors. These are less slippery when wet than 
polished granite. However, a sealer is required with this type of finish to 
prevent staining during grouting and to protect from oil or grease stains. 
These finishes are easy to apply and do not need stripping for touch-up 
reapplication.</p> 
<h3>Agglomerate Tiles for Kitchens or Baths: Recommendations, Installation</h3>
<p>Agglomerate tiles consist of graded chips of marble or granite mixed with a 
resin binder and stone dust. Typical thicknesses vary from about 1/4 inch to 
7/8 inch. Agglomerates usually cost less than natural stone, but have many of 
the same virtues and limitations as their natural counterparts.</p> 
<p>For example, granite agglomerates are harder than marble agglomerates, and 
the polish on granite can withstand greater abrasion and last longer. Also, 
granite agglomerates will resist mild household acids, such as citrus juice and 
vinegar, while these will tend to etch marble agglomerates.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Using Kitchen or Bath Tile Sealers</h3> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Floor Tile Sealers, Ceramic/Stone <strong>for 
the detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.
</p> 
<p>A wide variety of proprietary sealers are available to protect natural 
stone against staining from grout, dirt, foods, and household products. In 
addition, some sealers help conceal minor scratches and increase slip 
resistance.</p> 
<p>Some products require regular reapplication and may cause a surface buildup 
unless stripped. Penetrating oil-type sealers may change the color of some 
types of stone and can even trap dirt in the finish. For best results, follow 
recommendations of the stone supplier and use products with an established 
track record.</p> 
<h2>Recommended Floor Framing under Tile to Avoid Cracks </h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Floor Framing &amp; Subfloor for Tile <strong>
for the detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are 
below.</p> 
<p> Tiles, stones, and grout joints crack easily from stresses imposed by 
movement. For a successful installation, the structure underneath must be very 
stiff. On walls, 16-inch on-center framing with 2x4s or steel studs is usually 
adequate. Floors must be level and subject to minimal deflection under uniform 
or point loads.</p> 
<h3>Floor Deflection Problems in Tile Floors Lacking Stiffness</h3> 
<p> An insufficiently stiff floor will crack ceramic or stone tiles. The Tile 
Council of America (TCA) specifies a maximum deflection for floors of L/360 
under a 300-pound concentrated load. While building codes limit deflection in 
living spaces to L/360 under uniform loads, code-compliant floors may still 
have too much flexing between joists under point loads. Many natural stone 
tiles require stiffer conditions, ranging from L/480 to as stiff as L/720.</p> 
<h3>Subflooring Requirements for Tile Floors</h3> 
<p>To meet TCA stiffness requirements, floor framing should be no more than 16 
inches on-center with minimum 19/32 -inch plywood subflooring. Upgrading to 
23/32- inch plywood will stiffen the subfloor by almost 80% and provide a more 
solid feeling floor. The subflooring should be level to 1/8 inch in 10 feet. 
(TCA specs now permit 1/4 inch in 10 feet, but this can be problematic for the 
large tiles popular today.)</p> 
<p>To avoid tile cracks caused by tight-fitting plywood joints, it is best to 
use square-edged subflooring under tile and leave an 1/8-inch gap between 
sheets (unless the setting material specifications require tight joints). Lay 
the plywood with its long dimension across the joists and use solid blocking at 
all open joints.</p> 
<h3>Two-Layer Subflooring System for Ceramic Tile Floors</h3> 
<p>To meet the stiffness requirements for natural stone floors may require two 
layers of subflooring screwed and glued together, with the upper layer serving 
as the underlayment.</p> 
<p>Two layers of 19/32 inch plywood glued and screwed together on 6-inch 
centers is several times stiffer than a single layer (and over four times as 
stiff as a single layer of 23/32-inch plywood). Offset the upper layer so the 
joints do not line up with the joints in the lower layer or the joists.</p> 
<p>Also, screws in the upper layer, which serves as underlayment for the tile, 
should penetrate the subfloor only and not the joists. Use underlayment- grade 
plywood or plywood rated C-C Plugged or Plugged Crossbands, with a smooth face 
and no voids.</p> 
<h3>Floor Substrates for Ceramic Tile: Concrete, Cement Backerboard, Plywood, 
Drywall, Plaster</h3> 
<p> Ceramic tile can be installed over clean and sound concrete, plywood, 
cement backerboard, drywall, or plaster. Most substrates can be used with 
either organic mastic or thinset mortar, but the installer should always check 
the adhesive label for compatibility with the substrate.</p> 
<h2>Plywood Underlayment Specifications for Tile for Floors or Countertops</h2>
<p>Because of its stiffness and durability, exterior plywood makes an 
excellent substrate for tile in relatively dry applications.</p> 
<li><strong>Plywood type</strong>. The plywood should be free of internal 
voids such as underlayment grade, CC-Plugged, or Plugged Crossbands , and if 
tiling directly to plywood, it should have a sanded face free of voids, surface 
resin, or other surface defects. While TCA specs allow 15/32-inch plywood 
underlayment over a 19/32 inch subfloor in residential work, upgrading to 19/32 
inch underlayment is recommended for a trouble-free floor (Figure 6-32).</li> 
<li><strong>Plywood installation</strong>. Leave a 1/8 -inch gap between 
sheets and make sure the edges of adjacent plywood sheets are no more than 1/32 
inch out of plane. Overall, the surface should be level to 1/8 inch over 10 
feet (1/4 inch is allowed by the tile industry but is not suitable for large 
tiles). Fasten with ring-shank nails or screws at 6 inches on-center.</li> 
<li><strong>Glue and screw</strong>. Where greater stiffness is required in a 
floor, it is worth the effort to also glue the underlayment to the subfloor and 
upgrade from nails to screws.</li> 
<li><strong>Isolation membrane</strong>. On large spans or where significant 
movement is expected in the floor due to wide moisture or temperature swings, a 
crack-isolation membrane is recommended as a precaution against cracking. 
Membranes, if sealed at seams, can also protect the plywood from moisture that 
seeps through the tile system. This is required in wet applications and 
recommended in applications subject to occasional wetting, such as bathroom 
floors.</li> 
<li><strong>Countertops</strong>. Plywood also works well as a tile substrate 
on walls and countertops not subject to regular wetting (Figure 6-33). In 
applications subject to high humidity or regular wetting, cement backerboard or 
glass-mat gypsum are better choices.</li> 
<h2>Cement Backerboard for Use Under Ceramic Tile: Installation Specifications
</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Cement Backerboard Installation <strong>for 
the detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.
</p> 
<p>Developed specifically for use under ceramic tile, cementitious backer 
units (CBUs) are made of sand and cement and are reinforced by fiberglass 
facings or chopped fibers within the material itself. Cement backerboard is 
impervious to moisture, but may let moisture pass through, so it should always 
be backed by a waterproof barrier, such as polyethylene sheeting or 
asphalt-impregnated felt.</p> 
<p>Because the material has little inherent strength, it relies on the 
structure beneath for stiffness when used on floors and other applications 
subject to significant loads. A variation on cement backerboard, Hardibacker 
(James Hardie Building Products), is made of fiber-cement. Because it is only 
1/4 inch thick, it is usually installed over 1/4 -inch plywood, both for 
stiffness and to bring it flush with the surrounding drywall.</p> 
<p>Cement backerboard should be installed with special backerboard screws (not 
drywall nails) that have an anti corrosive coating and oversized heads with 
ridges underneath designed to self-countersink and pull tight. Roofing nails 
are also acceptable with most backerboards.</p> 
<p>Closely follow manufacturers instructions, which vary a little from product 
to product. Typical installations include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Backerboard on walls</strong>: CBUs can go directly over studs at 
16 inches on-center or over drywall, and it is fastened with 1 1/2 -inch 
galvanized roofing nails or special self-countersinking galvanized screws at 6 
to 8 inches on-center.</li> 
<li><strong>Backerboard on floors and countertops</strong>: CBUs are bonded to 
the plywood with a layer of latex- or acrylic-modified thinset (Figure 6-34 and 
Figure 6-35). Apply the thinset with the flat side of a 1/4 -inch notched 
trowel, then rake with the notched side to provide a continuous level setting 
bed. Seat the backerboard evenly with a beating block, then secure with roofing 
nails or special backerboard screws. Because CBUs provide little added 
stiffness, it is best to upgrade to a 23/32-inch subfloor.</li> 
<li><strong>Joint details for Cement Backerboard Under Tile</strong>: Leave a 
1/8 - to 3/16-inch gap between adjoining sheets of backerboard and at edges. 
Just before tiling, fill the joints with thinset and cover with 2-inch-wide 
fiber mesh tape (unless the adhesive manufacturer recommends otherwise). Then 
embed the tape in a thin skim coat of thinset. Reinforce inside and outside 
corners with three pieces of 2-inch tape or one piece of 4-inch tape.</li> 
<li><strong>Obstruction Clearances at Concrete Backerboards</strong>: Leave a 
minimum 1/4 -inch gap where the CBU meets a tub lip, plumbing fixture, pipe, or 
any restraining surface and fill the joint with a flexible, waterproof sealant.
</li> </ul> 
<h2>Installation Guide for Drywall Substrate Below Tile</h2> 
<p>Regular 1/2-inch drywall over 2x4 framing or steel studs 16 inches 
on-center is a suitable substrate for dry installations. Using 5/8-inch drywall 
or a second layer of 1/2-inch will provide a stiffer wall. Joints should be 
taped and one coat of joint compound applied to joints and nails. If tiles will 
be set in thinset mortar, use thinset with mesh tape at the drywall joints.</p> 
<h3>Using &quot;Greenboard&quot; Moisture-Resistant Drywall Under Tile</h3> 
<p>Commonly called &ldquo;greenboard,&rdquo; this offers moderate protection 
in moist conditions, but it is not recommended in wet areas, such as tub 
surrounds, unless protected by a waterproof membrane.</p> 
<h3>Coated Glass-Mat Gypsum Backerboard Use Under Tile</h3> 
<p>Competing with cement backerboard, gypsum products such as Georgia 
Pacific&rsquo;s Dens-Shield&reg; are designed as tile substrates for damp 
areas. The gypsum core is treated with silicone to make it water-resistant, and 
the fiberglass and acrylic facing acts as a surface vapor barrier.</p> 
<p>While not as strong as cement backerboard, gypsum-based backerboard 
installs faster since it cuts and installs like drywall. Installation is with 
roofing nails or galvanized bugle-head drywall screws, which should be driven 
flush with the surface but should not break the waterproof skin.</p> 
<p>Panels are butted tightly and the joints are taped and embedded with latex 
Portland cement mortar, also used to set the tile.</p> 
<p>In use since 1987, Dens-Shield&reg; is well-suited to tub surrounds and 
other light-duty wall applications, but it is not suitable for saunas, steam 
rooms, or other applications facing extreme heat and humidity. As with other 
tile substrates, follow manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions closely regarding 
framing, installation, and tile application.</p> 
<h2>Guide to Installing Tile Over Concrete Slabs</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Tile Over Concrete Slab <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p>Tiles can be applied directly to a clean, smooth concrete slab with a latex 
Portland cement mortar. The concrete should be properly cured, be level to 1/4 
inch in 10 feet, and have a steel trowel or fine broom finish. Curing compounds 
or old adhesives used for carpeting or resilient flooring will act as bond 
breakers, so they need to be removed before installing the tile.</p> 
<p>Either a power-blast cleaning machine or a rotary sander with a coarse 
carborundum sanding sheet can be used. If the slab has cracks or control 
joints, a crack isolation membrane should be used (seeIsolation Membranes).</p> 
<h3>Other Tile Substrates Used in Remodeling</h3> 
<p>In remodeling, tiles can be successfully installed over existing ceramic 
tile, plastic laminate, or resilient flooring (except the cushioned type) that 
is well bonded. These must be stripped of any sealers or waxes and scarified 
with a coarse sander before applying the new adhesive. Wood floors must first 
be covered with plywood or a cementitious backerboard.</p> 
<p>Unsuitable substrates that should not be used under tile include 
oriented-strand board (OSB), lower grades of plywood with voids, and interior 
grade plywoods such as lauan.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Using Floor Leveling Compounds For Setting Tile</h3> 
<p>If a wood floor or slab needs leveling, you can use special cement leveling 
compounds formulated for use as a substrate for ceramic tile or stone tile. 
These are either site-mixed from a bag or installed by a specialty 
subcontractor. Some are self-leveling and others require screeding.</p> 
<p>Gypsum-based underlayments are generally not suitable for tile. Most 
self-leveling compounds can be installed up to about an inch thick. For thicker 
applications, let the first layer dry before adding more, or fill lower areas 
with plywood shims before adding the compound. Use exterior-grade plywood with 
no voids.</p> 
<h2>Guide to Moisture and Water Barriers for Kitchen or Bath Tile</h2> 
<p> Although glazed ceramic tile is waterproof, neither the grout joints nor 
the cement backerboard behind the tile are water barriers. To prevent moisture 
from passing through the tile and substrate to the plywood or wood framing, a 
moisture barrier is required in areas subject to high moisture levels or 
occasional wetting, such as tub surrounds and kitchen counters.</p> 
<p>In areas subject to heavy wetting, such as shower pans and some bathroom 
floors and counters, a sheet membrane or trowel-on membrane should be used to 
provide full waterproofing.</p> 
<h3>Moisture Barriers for Kitchen or Bath Tile</h3> 
<p>On tiled walls, protect the wood framing from water intrusion, using either 
6-mil poly or 15-pound asphalt-impregnated felt lapped to shed water. The 
barrier should go between the tile substrate and the framing. On outside walls, 
this material can also served as the air and vapor barrier if the joints are 
sealed with tape or a compatible sealant.</p> 
<h3>Tile Membranes for Wet Areas, Bathrooms, Showers</h3> 
<p>Full waterproofing is required in construction that must retain water, such 
as shower pans and tiled tubs. It is also recommended in areas subject to 
frequent wetting, such as raised tub surrounds, bathroom floors, and counters 
with sinks. There are two types of membranes: thermoplastic sheet materials and 
trowel-on membranes.</p> 
<p>Sheet membranes can be applied to most tile substrates with either thinset 
mortar or a proprietary adhesive, and tiles are bonded directly to the 
membrane. With any membrane, check the label for compatibility with the 
substrate and adhesives. Most waterproofing membranes also serve as isolation 
membranes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Sheet membranes</strong>: These single-layer elastomerics, such as 
chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), are bonded to the 
substrate&acirc;&#128;&#148;typically cement backerboard, plywood, or a mortar 
bed&acirc;&#128;&#148;with a compatible thinset mortar or proprietary adhesive (
Figure 6-36). <br>
<br>
 After the adhesive cures, tiles are set onto the 
membrane with a second layer of thinset. For watertight performance, joints in 
the membrane are caulked with a proprietary sealant or are solvent-welded. In 
addition to stopping water, CPE membranes act as an isolation membrane, 
protecting the tile and grout from movement in the substrate (see 
&ldquo;Isolation Membranes,&rdquo; p. 237).<br>
<br>
 Examples are Noble-Seal 
TS (Noble Company) and Dal-Seal TS (Dal-Tile Corp.), both 30-mil thick CPE. 
Special heavier membranes are designed for shower pans, tubs, and other details 
that must contain standing water.</li> 
<li><strong>Trowel-on membranes</strong>: These one-part or two-part liquids 
are troweled or brushed on, some with a reinforcing fiberglass fabric. These 
are good for less critical areas that are only occasionally wetted, such as 
countertops, tub surrounds, and some floors.<br>
<br>
 They also provide 
limited protection against cracking due to movement in the substrate when used 
in conjunction with a reinforcing fabric. Examples of one-part membranes 
include Laticrete 9235 (Laticrete International, Inc.) and Mapelastic HPG 
(Mapei Corp.).</li> </ul> 
<h2>Expansion Joint Requirements in Tile Surfaces</h2> 
<p> Tile and grout are fairly unforgiving of movement in the substrate. To 
protect against cracking of the tile or grout joints, expansion joints are 
recommended by the Tile Council of America in the following places:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Every 24 to 36 feet </strong>each direction; or every 8 to 12 feet 
in each direction if the tiled surface is exposed to moisture or direct 
sunlight.</li> 
<li><strong>Around the perimeter</strong> of a room or wherever tile meets a 
different material or abuts restraining surfaces, such as curbs, columns, or 
pipes.</li> 
<li><strong>At inside corners</strong>, such as where a countertop meets the 
backsplash.</li> 
<li><strong>Wherever changes occur in the backing </strong>material, for 
example, from wood to masonry.</li> 
<li><strong>Directly over any expansion,</strong> control, construction, or 
cold joint</li> </ul> 
<p>Expansion joints should be at least 1/4 inch wide and free of grout, 
backerboard, or tile adhesive. Use an elastomeric caulk with a backer rod or 
bond-breaker tape to prevent three-sided bonding of the caulk (Figure 6-37). 
Most tile suppliers now carry colored caulks designed to match standard grout 
colors, or colored caulks can be ordered from Color Caulk (seeKitchen and Bath 
Product Sources Associations).</p> 
<h2>Guide to Using Isolation Membranes to Avoid Cracks in Tile Surfaces</h2> 
<p>Polymer-modified thinset can absorb small amounts of movement, but where 
more significant movement is expected, a crack isolation membrane is the safest 
approach. Examples include tiling over concrete with control joints or 
shrinkage cracks, over radiant slabs, or over existing tile or other 
problematic remodeling surfaces. Wood-framed floors with long joist spans of 16 
feet or more are also good candidates for isolation membranes.</p> 
<p>Tile contractors typically use the same type of elastomeric membrane used 
for waterproofing, such as Noble- Seal TS (Noble Company) or Dal-Seal TS (Dal 
Tile). It is applied as described above under &ldquo;Membranes&rdquo; (previous 
page), although joints between sheets do not need to be solvent welded unless 
waterproofing is also required.</p> 
<h3>Crack Isolation for Tile Surfaces</h3> 
<p>In repair work or other jobs where covering an entire floor with isolation 
membrane is not feasible, a strip of membrane can be installed over just a 
crack, change of materials, or control joint where minor movement is expected. 
In general, this will work where cracks are less than 1/8 inch wide, and there 
is no vertical movement.</p> 
<p>Also, with some types of membrane, the contractor can offset the 
sealant-filled &ldquo;soft joints&rdquo; in the tile, so they do not have to 
fall directly over the crack or control joint in a concrete slab. In this case, 
create soft joints on both sides of the crack or joint (Figure 6-38), using a 
flexible sealant instead of grout. If a crack in the concrete substrate runs 
diagonal to the grout joints, the soft joint must run in a zigzag pattern on 
each side of the crack.</p> 
<p>According to tile expert Michael Byrne, crack-isolation membranes used this 
way should be three times the width of the tile, but he cautions that the 
preferred approach is to cover the entire floor with membrane. This provides 
better protection against cracking and eliminates the soft joints and the 
slight bump in the tile surface, which may be unacceptable visually.</p> 
<h2>Floor Tile Setting Compounds Guide</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Tile Over Concrete Slab <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p> Manufacturers offer a wide range of setting compounds formulated for 
different setting beds and conditions. Choosing the wrong one can result in a 
failed tile job. For example, applications subject to moisture, temperature 
extremes, and heavy loading will need a higher quality setting compound than a 
kitchen backsplash, where organic mastic may serve perfectly well.</p> 
<p>If applying mortar to a thickness of over 1/4 inch to even out low spots in 
the floor or irregularities in the tile, use a medium-set mortar or 
multipurpose thinset suited to the task. With any product, it is important to 
follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions regarding application and 
compatibility with the particular substrate (seeTable 6-7).</p> 
<h3>Organic Mastics Used for Floor Tiles</h3> 
<p>These are ready-to-use adhesives primarily used with drywall and plywood 
substrates, although some are also approved for concrete and cement 
backerboards. Most now use a water-soluble formula, although some still use 
petroleum-based solvents.</p> 
<p>In general, mastics are the least expensive setting material and provide 
the least strength and flexibility. The substrate must be very flat, since 
mastic is troweled on thin and cannot bridge low spots or uneven joints. Mastic 
should be avoided in applications subject to high temperatures.</p> 
<p>Type II mastic is rated for use on walls not subject to wetting. Type I is 
approved for use on floors and wet areas. However, thinset mortars are better 
suited for floors and wet applications, for a modest increase in cost.</p> 
<h3>Dry-Set Mortar Use for Floor Tiles</h3> 
<p>Dry set mortar for floor tile installation is a factory blend of sand, 
cement, retarders, and other additives that is mixed with water on the job 
site. It provides a strong bond and high compressive strength, making it more 
suitable on floors than organic mastic. It is commonly used over concrete 
slabs, mortar beds, or cement backerboards. It cleans easily with water; but 
once dried, it is unaffected by water.</p> 
<h3>Polymer-Modified Mortar Uses for Floor Tile Installation</h3> 
<p>Polymer modified mortar for floor tiles is essentially dry-set mortar with 
latex or acrylic polymers added to increase the bond strength, compressive 
strength, and flexibility of the compound. One formulation uses a latex or 
acrylic liquid added to the dry mix at the job site.</p> 
<p>The other has dry polymers blended into the dry mix at the factory so only 
water is added on site. Polymer-modified mortar bonds well to most substrates, 
including waterproofing membranes, to provide a premium waterproof system. Some 
kinds are not recommended for use with plywood, however (always check the label 
for compatibility with a substrate).</p> 
<p>Cleanup should be done quickly with a damp sponge while the material is 
wet, or it is difficult to remove from skin and materials.</p> 
<h3>Modified-Epoxy Mortar and Grout System for Floor Tile Installation</h3> 
<p>Epoxy mortar for flooring is generally used for floors and countertops that 
require moderate chemical resistance, or where higher bond strength is needed 
to withstand greater loading, impacts, and flexing. It is also useful with 
questionable substrates such as existing tile, sheet vinyl, or plastic 
laminate, all of which are suitable for epoxy as long as they are sound and the 
surfaces are roughed up.</p> 
<p>In addition to their higher cost, these products have precise mixing 
requirements, a short pot life, and more difficult cleanup than standard 
thinsets. High-chemical-resistance formulations are also available. Cleanup of 
dried material requires special solvents, and the silica sand presents a 
respiratory hazard. Because of the mixing requirements and faster setup, 
skilled applicators are required.</p> 
<h3>Epoxy Adhesive &amp; Grout Floor Tile Details</h3> 
<p>Epoxy adhesive is often used to install green (serpentine), white, and 
other moisture sensitive marbles and marble agglomerates that may stain or warp 
with water-based products. It provides high-bond strength and impact-resistance 
over most sound substrates, including plywood.</p> 
<p> It also provides water-resistance and moderate chemical-resistance. It 
requires precise mixing and skilled application, and special solvents are 
required to remove any material that dries on the surface of the tile (or the 
installer&rsquo;s hands). Also, the silica sand presents a respiratory hazard.
</p> 
<h3>Guide to Tile Installation with Thinset Mortars</h3> 
<p>Thinset Application. All mastics and thinset mortars are applied in the 
same way. First apply a thin layer of the adhesive using the flat edge of the 
trowel for continuous coverage, then comb with the notched edge of the trowel 
to create a uniform, flat setting bed. Hold the trowel at about 30 degrees from 
the surface for the continuous layer and at about 45 degrees when combing with 
the notched edge (Figure 6-36).</p> 
<p>Notches range from about 3/16 inch for thin tile to 3/8 inch for tiles 
12x12 inches and larger or irregular tiles such as handmade pavers.</p> 
<p>A 1/4 -inch notch works for most other tiles. Always follow the directions 
on the can. Coverage varies depending on the type of substrate and tile, as 
well as the heat and humidity in the environment. this is particularly 
important with tile 12x12 inches or larger.</p> 
<p>Also apply thinset mortar to only one small section at a 
time&acirc;&#128;&#148;no larger than the area that can be tiled before the 
thinset skins over. Any thinset that skins over will have to be discarded.</p> 
<h3>Medium-Set Application for Tiles</h3> 
<p>Where irregularities in the substrate or tile shape, such as handmade 
pavers, require a setting bead thicker than 1/4 inch, choose a medium-set 
mortar or an all-purpose thinset approved for medium-set usage. Other thinset 
mortars are not strong enough when built up to that depth. Irregular-shaped 
tiles will need some adhesive &ldquo;back buttered&rdquo; directly to the tile 
to obtain proper coverage.</p> 
<h3>Tile Installation Using Thinset and Medium Set Mortars</h3> 
<p>Next press and twist in a sample tile to check the adhesive coverage. ANSI 
standards require that dry interior tiles be evenly covered over at least 80% 
of their surface area (Figure 6-39).</p> 
<p>Wet or exterior applications require 95% coverage. When set back in place 
and beat in with a rubber mallet (larger tiles) or beating block (smaller tiles 
such as mosaics), the setting bed should be about 3/32 inch but not larger than 
1/4 inch, unless medium-set mortar is used. Irregular-shaped handmade tiles 
need some adhesive &ldquo;back buttered&rdquo; directly to the tile to obtain 
proper coverage.</p> 
<h2>Grout Installation Guide for Tile Jobs</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see </strong> Grout Installation, Tile <strong>for the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section.</strong> Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p>A high-quality grout job makes a tile installation stronger, more 
attractive, and easier to clean. Properly formed joints are generally flat for 
square-edge tiles and slightly concave for rounded-edge tiles.</p> 
<p>Standard grout is a mixture of Portland cement and additives to control its 
texture and cure time, along with pigments if the grout is colored. In general, 
floors do best with a basic gray or other dark grout. White and light colors 
show stains the most. Most grouts also contain latex or acrylic additives to 
improve their performance.</p> 
<h3>Properties of Sanded vs. Un sanded Tile Grout</h3> 
<p>Sand is added to grout to strengthen the grout where joints are wider than 
1/8 inch. For joints wider than 1/2 inch, special grout with coarser sand is 
recommended.</p> 
<h3>Polymer Additives for Tile Grout</h3> 
<p> Most grouts now have latex or acrylic compounds added either to the dry 
mix at the factory or as liquid on the job site. These polymer additives make 
the grout more water-resistant, flexible, and stain resistant, and, with 
colored grouts, better able to maintain a consistent color. Although cured 
grout, like other masonry products, is unaffected by water, it cannot be relied 
on as a waterproof material.</p> 
<h2>Epoxy Tile Grouts Resist Stains</h2> 
<p>For a higher degree of stain-resistance as well as moderate resistance to 
some chemicals, epoxy grout is a good option for applications such as showers, 
bathroom floors, or heavily used kitchen counters. One type, called 
epoxy-emulsion grout, mixes a two-part epoxy with Portland cement and sand.</p> 
<p>Another, called 100%- solids epoxy, mixes two-part epoxy with silica sand 
filler. Both types require precise mixing and installation. If joint cleaning 
is rushed, the grout pulls out and smears the tile; too much delay causes it to 
harden before you can shape the joints. If installed correctly, however, epoxy 
grout offers excellent protection against staining and does not require 
sealing. Epoxy grout will yellow slightly over time, however, particularly if 
exposed to direct sunlight.</p> 
<h2>Instructions for Tile Preparation &amp; Tile Grouting</h2> 
<p>Allow the adhesive to dry at least overnight, or longer if recommended by 
the manufacturer, before grouting. Clean any adhesive or foreign matter from 
the grout joints. If the tiles are nonvitreous and unglazed, as with handmade 
pavers, they may need to be sealed prior to grouting to prevent staining. Also, 
light-colored glazed tiles may need to be sealed to prevent stains from dark 
colored grouts.</p> 
<p>With nonvitreous tiles, which soak up moisture, it is best to mist or 
sponge the tiles just before grouting so the grout will cure properly. For best 
results, maintain the room temperature between 50&deg;F and 80&deg;F during 
grouting and curing.</p> 
<h3>Grout Installation Details: Mixing &amp; Application</h3> 
<p>Mix the tile grout by hand or with a paddle bit run at slow speed (air 
bubbles from fast mixing will weaker the mix). After letting the grout 
&ldquo;slake&rdquo; for 10 minutes, which allows the ingredients to fully 
react, the material is remixed and ready to apply as follows, working one small 
area of several square feet at time (seeFigure 6-40):</p> 
<p>1. Using a rubber grout float held at about 45 degrees to the tiles, force 
the grout into the joints from several directions.</p> 
<p>2. Scrape away the excess grout with the float held at about 90 degrees to 
the surface.</p> 
<p>3. Once the grout is firm, typically in 15 to 30 minutes, clean the surface 
of the tiles with a sweeping motion, using a large clean round-edged sponge 
squeezed as dry as possible (water splashed on the joint lines can weaken the 
grout or cause splotchy coloring).</p> 
<p>4. First remove the excess grout from the face of the tiles, then 
concentrate on shaping the grout joints. Rinse the sponge frequently, always 
keeping it as dry as possible.</p> 
<p>5. Clean until just a light haze remains, which can be wiped off with a 
damp rag when the grout is dry.</p> 
<p>Now is also the time to pack fresh grout into any voids you discover and 
clean the grout out of any &ldquo;soft joints&rdquo; that are to be filled with 
sealant. Use the tip of a margin trowel to clean up any corners or problem 
joints. With sanded grout, it is also a good idea to strike the joints with a 
curved metal implement, such as the back of a spoon, a steel chisel handle, or 
the side of a nail set to help force any exposed sand below the surface. This 
make the joint smoother and easier to clean.</p> 
<h3>Damp Curing Recommended for Portland cement grout</h3> 
<p>Traditional Portland cement grout requires several days of damp curing to 
reach its full strength. This was typically done by covering the freshly 
grouted tile with Kraft paper and periodically misting or sponging the tile. 
Most modern grouts with latex or acrylic additives, however, do not require wet 
curing except in very hot, dry weather. As with all tile products, check the 
label for instructions.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Using Tile Grout Sealers</h3> 
<p>While latex or acrylic additives help protect the grout from staining, 
sealing the grout after it cures provides the best protection. There are a wide 
variety of products on the market. Consult the directions regarding when and 
how often to apply. Many require reapplication annually or more often, 
depending on the specific use. Regardless, to keep grout from darkening and 
staining, it will need regular cleaning with a grout cleaner or mild detergent. 
Avoid oil-based soaps as they tend to darken grout.</p> 
<h2>Recommendations for Constructing or Installing Bath Shower Pans</h2> 
<p><strong>Please see</strong> Bathroom Shower Pans, Build, Install the 
detailed, illustrated version of this section. Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p>A shower pan must be completely watertight and able to hold pooled water 
should the drain get clogged. Most are built in place over a mortar bed with a 
waterproof membrane liner. However prefabricated setting beds have also become 
available recently.</p> 
<h3>Using Prefab Cement Shower Pans</h3> 
<p>For standard shapes and sizes, one option is to install a prefabricated pan 
made from 40-lb polystyrene foam coated with a reinforced cementitious coating 
that is ready to receive tile. These range in size from 36x36 inches to 36x60 
inches and come pre sloped with a built-in drain.</p> 
<p>One unit, called Pro-Form (Bonsal American) is bonded to the subfloor with 
latex modified thinset, coated with a liquid waterproofing membrane, and is 
then ready to tile. As long as the subfloor is sufficiently stiff to prevent 
flexing, these units should perform well with 4x4&acirc;&#128;&#147;inch tiles. 
Smaller tiles may exert too much of a point load for the underlying foam, while 
larger tiles can cause problems with the slope angle.</p> 
<h3>How to Install Prefab Plastic Shower Pans</h3> 
<p>A less expensive option is to combine tiled walls with a one-piece 
fiberglass or acrylic shower pan (not to be tiled). These are the same 
materials used in one-piece shower or shower-tub units. A few companies also 
sell stand-alone solid-surface shower pans.</p> 
<p>Like other plastic units, these must be properly supported underneath to 
prevent flexing and cracking. Some require setting in sand, wet mortar, or 
plaster. In general, acrylic units cost more than fiberglass but are stronger 
and less prone to flexing and cracking.</p> 
<h3>How to Build Mortar-Bed Shower Pans</h3> 
<p>Built-in-place shower floors using a mortar bed and modern waterproofing 
membranes can provide many years of trouble-free service. For best performance 
use a heavy-duty sheet membrane, such as 40-mil Chloraloy (Noble Company), 
which is designed for use in shower pans and similar applications.</p> 
<p>To guarantee that any trapped water will drain properly, the membrane is 
placed on a layer of latex-modified mortar sloped 1/4 inch per foot toward the 
drain. Two-piece clamping-type drains are designed to seal to the membrane by 
compression between the upper and lower flanges (seeFigure 6-41).</p> 
<p>A layer of sealant applied between the membrane and lower flange serves as 
backup waterproofing. Weep holes around the bottom of the drain, surrounded by 
pea gravel or pieces of broken tile, allow any water that accumulates to drain 
away (seeFigure 6-42).</p> 
<p>The membrane should run up all sides of the shower, at least 3 inches above 
the height of the finished curb. Secure the membrane to the framing with 
galvanized staples or roofing nails along the top edge, being careful to make 
no holes in the membrane any lower than 2 inches above the finished curb.</p> 
<p>At the inside wall corners, the extra membrane material is not cut, but 
pleated and folded over to lay flat against the framing. Avoid making wrinkles 
here or along the bottom of the pan. At the curb, the membrane must be cut so 
it can fold over the top of the curb. Seal these corner cuts with either 
prefabricated &ldquo;dam corners&rdquo; or patches of membrane caulked in place 
with Nobleseal 150, a high-performance Kraton-based sealant.</p> 
<h2>Kitchen Cabinet Choices &amp; Design Guide</h2> 
<p> Kitchen cabinets range widely in styles, materials, and levels of quality. 
Well-made cabinets feature sturdy cabinet boxes and drawers, stiff shelves that 
resist sagging, and solid hardware that operates smoothly. Higher-end cabinets 
make greater use of veneer-core plywood rather than medium-density fiberboard 
(MDF), particleboard, or other composites.</p> 
<p>Doors, drawer fronts, and visible end panels in premium cabinets make use 
of solid wood, real wood veneer, or high-pressure plastic laminate. At a 
glance, it is not always easy to discern quality levels since the best 
wood-grain vinyl facings do a surprisingly good imitation of real wood, at 
least until someone dents or scratches a corner.</p> 
<p>With so many variables, it is not surprising to find that a set of cabinets 
for a midsize kitchen could range in price from as little as $3,000 for 
builder-grade cabinets picked up at a home center to as much as $20,000 for a 
custom high-end job.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Wall Cabinet Grades</h3> 
<p> The cabinet industry generally divides cabinets into three main grades: 
stock, semicustom, and custom.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Stock cabinets</strong> are mass-produced in factories in standard 
sizes, typically in increments of 3 inches, although all sizes may not be 
available for certain items. Each line comes in a limited number of materials, 
styles, and options. These are the least expensive option with the quickest 
delivery time, but usually not the best quality. Fillers are used to fit the 
cabinets into place.</li> 
<li><strong>Semicustom cabinets</strong> may be similar to stock cabinets in 
quality level or may be significantly better. Since these are made to order, 
however, the buyer has many more choices for wood species and finishes, 
laminates, door styles, and storage options and accessories. More sizes, 
including special heights and depths, are often available. Like stock cabinets, 
these are built in 3-inch increments, requiring filler strips for installation.
</li> 
<li><strong>Custom cabinets</strong> are made to order by smaller shops for an 
individual job. Each shop has its own preferred materials, styles, options, and 
details; but for enough money, most shops will create whatever is requested. 
With a custom fit, filler blocks are not needed.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cabinet Materials</h3> 
<h3>Cabinet Panel Products</h3> 
<p>Cabinets use a wide variety of substrate materials for panels. The main 
panel products, typically covered with a wood, melamine, or vinyl veneer, are 
listed below:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Hardboard</strong>, sometimes referred to by the brand 
Masonite&reg;, is made from compressed wood fibers and lignin or phenolic 
resin. It swells and degrades when wet and is used for drawer bottoms, backs, 
and bottoms of lower-end cabinets.</li> 
<li><strong>Particleboard</strong> is made from small wood particles that are 
resin-bonded under pressure and heat. Type I uses urea-formaldehyde resin and 
Type II uses water resistant phenol-formaldehyde resin. Density classes are L 
(low), M (medium), and H (high). Better cabinets use medium-density stock (40 
to 50 pounds/cu ft). Some also use Type II, which is water-resistant and has 
little off-gassing of formaldehyde. Particleboard tends to swell when wet, and 
it is used widely for cabinet panels, shelves, and doors. Formaldehyde 
off-gassing may be a concern.</li> 
<li><strong>Medium-density fiberboard</strong>, or MDF, is a high-quality 
substrate made from fine fibers and urea-formaldehyde resin. It is more stable 
than plywood, stiffer than particleboard, and less affected by water. Its 
surface is smoother than particleboard and can be routed, shaped, and painted.
<br> <br>
 MDF is widely used for all cabinet panels and shelves. A 36- to 
38-lb/cu ft density is adequate for most applications, although some use 42- to 
48-pound material. The high formaldehyde content is a concern to individuals 
concerned about off-gassing.</li> 
<li><strong>Plywood</strong> is made from thin wood sheets laminated to each 
other with the grain running at right angles in alternate plies for strength. 
Interior grades, typically used in cabinets, use urea-formaldehyde resin. 
Better quality cabinets use plywood for cabinet panels, shelves, and drawer 
bottoms. Plywood resists water damage.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Guide to Cabinet Finishes</h3> 
<p>These are the most common finish materials used for cabinet sides, 
interiors, and door and drawer fronts.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Wood veneer cabinets</strong>. Wood veneer is a thin layer of wood 
bonded to particleboard, MDF, or plywood to give the appearance of solid wood. 
Used in both flat and raised panels, veneer provides good grain matching. 
Veneered panels rarely have problems, although scratches or dents are easier to 
repair on solid wood. Very high heat or humidity can cause cracking or 
delamination. The finish may be a simple solvent-based varnish or a more 
advanced and expensive multi coat system.</li> 
<li><strong>High-pressure laminate cabinets</strong>. Often called 
&ldquo;plastic laminate,&rdquo; high-pressure laminate is composed of layers of 
resin-saturated kraft paper with a clear melamine finish. High-pressure 
laminate is widely used on countertops because it is inexpensive, durable, and 
easy to clean.<br>
<br>
 Scratches and damage are difficult to repair, however. 
It is used on door and drawer fronts and occasionally on side panels. 
Color-through laminates are also available at a higher cost. These hide chips 
and scratches better and do not leave a telltale dark edge at corner seams.</li>
<li><strong>Melamine cabinets</strong>. Also known as low-pressure laminate, 
melamine is thinner and less durable than high-pressure laminate. It comes 
applied to particleboard or MDF with a paper layer under the melamine that 
provides the color or wood grain. Low-pressure laminate can chip or crack and 
may discolor over time. It is used widely on cabinet boxes and door backs, and 
on door and drawer fronts on low-end cabinets.</li> 
<li><strong>Vinyl cabinets</strong>. Vinyl is a plastic sheet material that 
comes applied to a particleboard or MDF substrate, and is printed with a 
wood-grain or other pattern. It is typically 2 to 4 mils thick and is not as 
durable as melamine, although the heavier 4-mil material resists scratches 
fairly well. Exposed, unfinished edges are prone to damage, and scratches or 
dents are difficult to repair.</li> 
<li><strong>Rigid thermofoil (RTF) cabinets</strong>. RTF is a rigid PVC sheet 
that is heated, vacuum-formed, and glued onto MDF doors and moldings, creating 
a seamless face. Most RTF doors are shaped to simulate a raised panel door. 
Thermofoil is available in many colors and woodgrain patterns, although white 
is the most common.<br>
<br>
 High-quality RTF is durable, scratch-resistant, 
and resists yellowing&acirc;&#128;&#148;a problem with some of the early 
formulations. Better products carry warranties of five or more years. When 
using wood-grain thermofoil, it is best to use full-overlay doors and matching 
thermofoil moldings, since real wood finishes will age differently than the 
thermofoil. Many thermofoil doors have matching melamine backs.</li> 
<li><strong>Painted cabinets</strong>. There are a number of high-quality 
painted finishes that are durable, lustrous, and resistant to crazing, 
chipping, or yellowing. Polyester paint, also used on cars and appliances, is a 
very expensive option that requires many coats that are oven-cured and 
wet-sanded by hand. The finish can be gloss or matte and fills the pores of the 
wood, giving it a solid appearance.<br>
<br>
 Catalyzed enamel paint is a less 
expensive option that uses a two-part formula to achieve a similar lacquer like 
finish. Although these paints resist chipping, nicks are difficult to touch up 
and blend in. Also hairline cracks will typically appear at the joints in solid 
wood doors due to expansion and contraction&acirc;&#128;&#148;not a problem 
with a dimensionally stable substrate such as MDF.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Guide to Assessing the Quality of Kitchen or Bathroom Cabinets</h2> 
<p> Assessing a cabinet&rsquo;s quality is not always easy due to the large 
number of components involved and the fact that much of the material and 
joinery is concealed. One good indication of overall durability is 
certification by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association, which has a 
rigorous testing and certification program that measures such things as 
structural integrity, shelf strength, hardware durability, and quality of 
finishes.</p> 
<p>Also, many manufacturers offer two or three grades of quality. Comparing 
the specifications of each line can provide a good idea of what the upgrades 
are and whether the added expense is worthwhile. The main components to 
evaluate are covered below.</p> 
<h3>Types of Kitchen or Bathroom Cabinet Boxes</h3> 
<p>The cabinet box, or carcase, makes up the body of the cabinet and gives it 
structural integrity. Typically, the only visible parts are end panels, 
portions of the interior, and the front edges in frameless cabinets or 
faceframes in framed cabinets (Figure 6-43).</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Framed cabinets</strong>. These are the traditional style of 
construction with a frame of 3/4-inch-thick solid wood rails and stiles 
fastened to the front of the box. Hinges attach to these face-frames, which are 
usually partly or fully visible with the doors closed.</li> 
<li><strong>Frameless cabinets</strong>. Also called 32-mm cabinets or Euro 
cabinets, these have no face-frames in front. The doors attach directly to the 
inside face of the cabinet sides with cup hinges. Doors and drawers are usually 
full overlay, concealing the front edges of the boxes.<br>
<br>
 However, some 
frameless cabinets now offer more traditional wooden doors that leave a narrow 
band of the cabinet fronts exposed. The front edge is typically finished in 
vinyl, melamine, or wood veneer. High-end cabinets may have solid wood banding.
</li> </ul> 
<p>With either type of cabinet, the price is driven by the materials, 
hardware, and assembly techniques. The cheapest cabinets typically use 1/2 - to 
5/8-inch particleboard with a vinyl or melamine face. Better quality cabinets 
use medium-density fiberboard (MDF), and the best generally use 1/2- to 
5/8-inch plywood. The facings on better cabinets are usually high-pressure 
laminate or real wood veneer.</p> 
<p>With some cabinet lines, it is possible to order plywood sides only where 
needed, for example, on the sink base and wherever there is an exposed end 
panel, which might be subject to wetting or the occasional dent or nick.</p> 
<p>Backs and floors if cabinets range from flimsy 1/8- or 1/4 -inch hardboard 
to thicker particleboard, MDF, or plywood (in order of stiffness). The finish 
inside the cabinet is typically vinyl or melamine. Cabinet bottoms should be 
rigid enough not to flex under the weight of pots and pans.</p> 
<p>Finally, look for securely installed corner blocks or stretchers across the 
top of the cabinet to hold it square during shipping and installation Some 
high-end cabinets have a full-size top panel to reinforce the top of the box.
</p> 
<h3>Guide to Types of Kitchen or Bathroom Cabinet Shelves</h3> 
<p>Shelves in cabinets range from 1/2 -inch particleboard, which will bow 
under the weight of dishes, to 3/4 -inch plywood. Plywood is the strongest 
shelving material, followed by MDF, then particleboard.</p> 
<p>In base cabinets, look for full depth shelves or roll-out shelving. Wall 
cabinet shelves should be adjustable and have solid clips, preferably metal. In 
general, shelves are designed to support a uniform load of 15 pounds per square 
foot (psf) for kitchens, 25 psf for closets, and 40 psf for bookshelves. If 
loads are likely to exceed these, upgrade to a stronger shelf (see Table 5-11, 
page 186).</p> 
<h3>Types of Kitchen or Bathroom Cabinet or Counter Drawers</h3> 
<p>It is important to have solidly built drawers, since they get a lot of use 
and abuse. High-quality drawers typically have solid hardwood or poplar sides 
and backs, with minimum 1/4 -inch plywood bottoms glued into dados. In the best 
cabinets, drawer sides are dovetailed or dowelled to the front and back and the 
drawer front is a separate piece screwed to the box.</p> 
<p>Respectable drawers are also built with sides of 1/2 -inch or thicker 
plywood or melamine stock dowelled together. In lower-end cabinets, drawer 
sides are often particleboard or MDF wrapped in vinyl and nailed or stapled and 
glued together, with a particleboard or hardboard bottom. Also many 
lower-quality cabinets use the drawer front as the front of the drawer box, a 
weaker detail.</p> 
<h3>Types &amp; Choices of Drawer Slides</h3> 
<p>All drawer slides, even with the same rating, are not alike. Look for 
heavy-duty epoxy-coated components with ball-bearing rollers that operate 
smoothly and quietly. At a minimum, use three-quarter extension drawer slides 
rated to carry 75 pounds.</p> 
<p>Consider upgrading to full-extension slides rated for 100 pounds, 
particularly for any large, deep drawers. Under mount slides have the advantage 
of helping to support the drawer while remaining out of sight. Side-mounted 
slides that wrap around the drawer bottom also provide good support.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Types of Cabinet Doors and Drawer Fronts</h3> 
<p>Doors and drawer fronts are the most visible part of a kitchen and take a 
lot of abuse. Many cabinet manufacturers buy doors and drawer fronts from large 
specialty door manufacturers, so they may not reflect the overall quality of 
the cabinets. When selecting a material and finish, consider durability and 
ease-of-cleaning as well as appearance. Frame-and-panel wood doors are 
typically more expensive than laminate or thermofoil doors.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Frame and panel cabinet doors</strong> or drawers have either a 
raised or flat panel of solid wood or veneer. Veneered panels are more stable 
but more difficult to repair if nicked or scratched. Avoid frames with mitered 
corners, as they may open with seasonal changes in humidity.</li> 
<li><strong>High-pressure plastic laminate cabinet doors and drawer fronts
</strong> are more durable than melamine (low-pressure laminate). Melamine is 
fine, however, for the backs of doors.</li> 
<li><strong>Painted wood cabinet doors or drawer fronts </strong>may show 
small gaps (over time) at joints due to seasonal movement of the wood. Also the 
center panel in a frame-and-panel door may show a paint line if the panel 
shrinks during the heating season.</li> 
<li><strong>Thermofoil (RTF) doors</strong> can provide a frame-and panel look 
with the convenience of a durable PVC plastic facing. It is best to use 
matching RTF moldings as well, since colors may change over time.</li> </ul> 
<p>Frameless cabinets typically have full overlay doors, while framed cabinets 
may have doors that are inset, rabbeted, or overlaid partially or fully (Figure 
6-44). Rabbeted or partial-overlay doors are the easiest to fit and adjust 
since they have considerable play.</p> 
<p>Inset doors provide an attractive furniture like appearance, but they are 
also a common cause of callbacks, since the slightest movement in cabinets or 
hinges can cause the doors or drawers to rub. Full-overlay doors also need 
careful adjustment, since they have only about an 1/8-inch gap to the next 
door. Fortunately, most are hung with easy-to-adjust cup hinges.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Types of Cabinet Hinges</h3> 
<p>Good quality hinges are sturdy, smooth to operate, and easy to adjust. 
Undersized or poor quality hinges, on the other hand, can lead to sagging or 
rubbing doors and are a common problem with low-end cabinets.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Cup hinges</strong>. Originally designed for full-overlay doors on 
frameless cabinets, concealed cup hinges are now available for most types of 
doors and cabinets (Figure 6-45). Most can be adjusted in three directions, 
which makes it easy to align the doors and compensate for minor irregularities 
in the cabinets.<br>
<br>
 Plus, many cup hinges have a convenient 
&ldquo;snap-on&rdquo; feature that allows removal of the door without tools. 
Swing angles range from 95 to 175 degrees, with typical doors opening from 105 
to 110 degrees. Special hinges are available for nearly every door 
configuration and self-closing types eliminate the need for magnetic or 
mechanical catches.</li> 
<li><strong>Barrel and knife hinges.</strong> These are partially concealed 
when closed and are usually adjustable in two directions by loosening the 
hinge-mounting screws. They are common on lower-end cabinets.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Design Guide &amp; Choices for Countertops for Kitchens and Baths</h2> 
<p> After the cabinets, the countertop is the most visible element in most 
kitchen and bath designs. In addition to providing a visual focal point, 
durable and easy-to-clean counters are critical for both hygiene and efficiency.
</p> 
<p>These workhorse surfaces should resist scratching, knife cuts, and burns, 
be impervious to water and stains, and wipe clean with a sweep of the sponge.
</p> 
<p>Nonporous surfaces like plastic laminate, solid surface, and engineered 
stone fit the bill well. While plastic laminate still dominates the market 
based on its combination of good performance and low cost, both natural and 
manmade stone products now account for a substantial and growing share of the 
market (Figure 6-46 and Figure 6-47).</p> 
<p>Since no one product can meet every need in a home, it often makes sense to 
mix and match materials, particularly in the kitchen. The main counter areas 
might be plastic laminate or solid surfacing with special sections using, for 
example, stone for baking, wood for a cutting board, and tile for a place to 
set hot pots. The most common countertop materials and their characteristics 
are shown inTable 6-8.</p> 
<h3>Countertop Design Issues</h3> 
<p>For ease of use and maintenance, a countertop will function best if it has 
the following characteristics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>A smooth surface</strong> that is nonporous, stain-resistant, and 
has minimal joints and seams.</li> 
<li><strong>A flush or under mount sink</strong> that lets the homeowner 
easily sweep water and dirt into the sink.</li> 
<li>A waterproof joint<strong> where the counter meets the backsplash and side 
splashes. Side splashes. should go wherever a</strong>counter end meets a wall 
or tall cabinet.</li> 
<li><strong>A coved corner</strong> at the backsplash makes this joint easier 
to keep clean.</li> 
<li><strong>In the kitchen: a no-burn area </strong>to set down hot pots.</li> 
<li><strong>In the bathroom: a raised dripless counter edge</strong> helps 
keep water contained near the sink.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cleanup Advice for Countertops</h3> 
<p>For most customers, easy cleanup of countertops is a top priority. While 
most of the materials discussed below are at least moderately stain-resistant, 
the actual performance will vary, depending on the specific color, pattern, 
finish texture (gloss vs. matte), and porosity of the material. If possible, 
obtain samples of the materials being considered, with sealers applied if 
planned.</p> 
<p>Mark each sample with a few stubborn stains: indelible marker, grape juice, 
salad oil. Let them dry for an hour and then see how easily they clean up with 
normal household cleansers and nonabrasive cleaning pads.</p> 
<h3>Advice About High-Pressure (Plastic) Laminate Countertops</h3> 
<p>Plastic laminate still dominates the market for kitchen counters, because 
it provides an attractive, durable surface at a cost of $5 to $10 per square 
foot versus $50 to $100 per square foot for solid surfacing or stone. The range 
of colors and textures continues to expand with new printing technologies that 
have produced realistic looking wood and stone surfaces.</p> 
<p>Made from a sandwich of resin-impregnated kraft paper, a decorative paper 
layer, and a top layer of clear melamine fused under heat and pressure, plastic 
laminate is impervious to moisture and resists scratches, dents, and chips. It 
can be scratched with a knife, however, or scorched with a hot pot. Small chips 
can be repaired with special sealers, but scratches and burns are permanent.</p>
<p>Before selecting a countertop color, it is a good idea to test a few sample 
squares with an indelible marker to see how easily the marks clean off. Matte 
finishes stain much more readily than gloss, and there may be considerable 
variation from one pattern and finish to another. More expensive color through 
plastic laminates show wear less than the standard type, and they eliminate the 
dark band at exposed edges.</p> 
<p>If using a postformed counter with a miter joint, it is essential to 
mechanically draw the joint tight and to seal that joint to prevent water 
intrusion, which will degrade the particleboard and open the joint. Silicone or 
special laminate seam sealer can be used.</p> 
<h3>Edge Treatment Choices for Countertops</h3> 
<p>There are now many alternatives to the traditional square edge that exposes 
the dark edge of the horizontal sheet of laminate. The least expensive is a 
postformed counter with either a seamless square edge or raised dripless edge. 
A wide variety of upgrades are available to dress up the counter. Beveled 
laminate, solid surfacing, and hardwood edging are common details. Site applied 
wood edging, however, can lead to problems over time if the joint is not 
watertight.</p> 
<h3>Cast Polymer (Cultured Marble, Engineered Stone) Countertop Guide</h3> 
<p>Cultured marble, solid surfacing, engineered stone, and most other 
composites used in kitchen and bath counters, sinks, and wall panels are 
different types of cast polymer. Cast polymer products consist of a plastic 
resin, either acrylic or polyester, and a mineral filler.</p> 
<p>The type and amount of filler largely determines the hardness, stain 
resistance, and overall durability of the product. Cultured marble, for 
example, which uses crushed limestone as a filler, is relatively soft and 
porous and needs to be protected by a gel coat.</p> 
<p>The new granite and quartz &ldquo;engineered stone&rdquo; composites, on 
the other hand, are nearly indestructible. These materials are described in 
greater detail below.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Cultured Marble Countertop Properties &amp; Quality</h3> 
<p>Cultured marble has been produced since the 1960s. It combines ground-up 
marble dust with polyester resins and pigments to make a sheet material for use 
in kitchens and bathrooms, as well as fireplace surrounds and other ornamental 
applications.</p> 
<p>Nearly all cultured marble products are finished with a thin clear or 
colored gel coat, which provides the color and pattern and creates a relatively 
hard and stain-resistant skin.</p> 
<p>Quality varies widely, as there are hundreds of small-volume manufacturers 
around the country producing the material. Some of the lower-quality products 
have had problems with crazing (small cracks) in the gel coat around drains and 
other areas subjected to thermal shocks. High-quality products should carry a 
label certifying compliance with ANSI standard Z-124.</p> 
<p>While cultured marble is stronger and less brittle than natural marble, it 
is less impact-resistant and scratch resistant than other cast polymers such as 
solid surfacing. The nonporous surface resists mildew and most stains and is 
easily cleaned with nonabrasive cleaning agents.</p> 
<p>Cultured marble is commonly used for vanity tops with integral sinks, as 
well as shower and tub enclosures, but it is rarely used for kitchen counters. 
Scratches and small chips can be repaired using a special gel-coat compound 
available from the supplier, but cracks or breaks cannot be repaired. Since the 
gel coat provides the color and pattern, significant damage to the gel-coat 
cannot be repaired.</p> 
<p>The sheen, however, can be restored with a thin coat of auto wax or Gel 
Gloss (TR Industries).</p> 
<p>Because many of the light-colored products are translucent, they should 
always be installed on a light-colored background material with clear silicone 
adhesive.</p> 
<h3>Solid Surfacing Corian-type Countertop Guide</h3> 
<p>Initially introduced as Corrigan&reg; by Dupont almost 40 years ago, solid 
surfacing products consist of mineral fillers, usually alumina trihydrate (a 
product of bauxite), and acrylic or polyester resins. Solid surfacing is a hard 
and durable homogenous material with color throughout and is easily machinable 
with woodworking tools.</p> 
<p>It can be seamlessly welded to itself at joints and to under mount sinks 
made of the same material. This creates an attractive, continuous work surface 
that is easy to wipe clean. An economical veneer version, laminated over a 
particleboard substrate, is available from some manufacturers.</p> 
<p>Because solid surfacing is nonporous, stains do not penetrate and it will 
not support mold or bacterial growth. Most stains can be wiped away with a 
nonabrasive pad and mild cleanser, although bleach is OK if needed. It also 
resists mild chemicals, but it should not be exposed for long to harsh 
chemicals, such as acetone or paint thinner. The alumina trihydrate filler also 
makes solid surfacing fire resistant, although it is possible to scorch the 
surface.</p> 
<p>While relatively easy to scratch or stain, solid surfacing is easily 
repaired. Tough stains as well as minor scratches or burns can be buffed out of 
a matte finish with an abrasive cleanser and Scotch-Brite pad, or wet sanded 
with very fine sandpaper (start with 1000-grit and use coarser grits as 
needed). Most solid surfacing used on countertops has a matte-satin finish, 
which is the easiest to maintain. For a gloss finish, follow the 
recommendations of the manufacturer.</p> 
<h3>Recommendations for Using Engineered Stone Countertops</h3> 
<p>The newest class of cast polymer, sometimes called composite or engineered 
stone, uses a high percentage of quartz, quartz silica, and granite to produce 
a material with the hardness of natural stone and the easy maintenance of solid 
surfacing. Engineered stone typically has over 90% stone aggregate with just 
enough acrylic resin and binders to hold it together. Combined under heat and 
pressure, the resulting material is uniform throughout and has greater flexural 
strength than stone.</p> 
<p>The nonporous surface is virtually stain-proof and very scratch-resistant, 
although it should not be used as a cutting board. Unlike natural stone, it 
does not require any sealing or waxing. Although it will not burn or scorch, 
placing hot pots directly on the surface can cause surface damage from the 
thermal shock.</p> 
<p>Some manufacturers are able to add a seamless under mount solid-surface 
sink to the engineered stone slab, adding to the appeal of the material. 
Products include Silestone&reg; (Cosentino USA), Zodiaq&reg;, (Dupont), 
Cambria&reg;, (Cambria), Technistone&reg; (Technistone USA), Ceasarstone&reg; 
(U.S. Quartz Products), and Granyte&reg; (Halstead International).</p> 
<h3>Guide to Choosing Ceramic Tile Countertops</h3> 
<p> Ceramic tile is a popular countertop material in the West and Southwest. 
Its main advantages are high durability and imperviousness to heat and water. 
Glazed tiles will not stain, and tiles rated for use on floors and counters are 
very scratch resistant. Softer tiles are prone to chipping, but damaged tiles 
can be removed and replaced if necessary. Installing ceramic tile on one 
section of counter near the range can provide a handy place to set down hot 
pots and pans.</p> 
<p>The main problem with tile counters are the grout joints, which tend to 
discolor over time. Using a latex modified grout and sealing the grout will 
help but will not prevent stains altogether. The best solution is to use an 
epoxy grout and to choose a dark or neutral grout color such as gray. Lighter 
colors are generally OK on backsplashes and walls. Tile is also very hard and 
prone to breaking fragile glasses or dishes that strike it.</p> 
<p>Two details that will enhance a tile counter are a V-cap nosing tile, which 
will create a clean-looking dripless edge, and a coved corner at the 
backsplash, which will make it easier to keep the corner clean. Tile counter 
details are shown inFigure 6-33 and Figure 6-35.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Choosing Natural Stone Countertops</h3> 
<p> Natural stone has become as popular as solid surfacing in the past few 
years as stone prices have dropped and finished stone slabs have become more 
widely available.</p> 
<p>In general, natural stone is hard, heavy, and cold, and is unaffected by 
heat and water. Bakers like the cool, smooth surface for handling dough. Stain 
and scratch resistance varies with stone type, but all stones need some type of 
sealer to prevent staining. The most common choices are discussed below:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Granite countertop properties</strong>: Very hard and resistant to 
scratching or chipping. Takes high polish. Oil and grease may stain granite if 
not sealed.</li> 
<li><strong>Marble countertop properties</strong>: Acidic foods etch or dull 
surface. Porous surface absorbs oils, stains, and some odors if not sealed. 
Avoid abrasive pads or cleansers.</li> 
<li><strong>Soapstone countertop properties</strong>: Very dense and 
stain-resistant but relatively soft. Usually treated with mineral oil. 
Scratches can be sanded out.</li> 
<li><strong>Slate countertop properties</strong>: Very stain-resistant. May 
need sealers depending on quality of stone. Minor scratches can be buffed out 
with steel wool.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Design Guide to Plumbing Fixtures for Kitchens &amp; Bathrooms</h2> 
<h3>Plumbing Fixture Recommendations for Sinks</h3> 
<p> Because of its durability and economy, stainless steel accounts for over 
60% of kitchen sinks in both new homes and remodels. In new construction 
bathrooms, cultured marble is the leading material for lavatory sinks, while 
the more expensive vitreous china leads in remodels.</p> 
<p>Both stainless steel and vitreous china are extremely durable, easy to 
clean, and impervious to rust, stains, and heat. Cultured marble quality 
varies, based largely on the thickness and quality of the thin gel coat that 
provides the color and wear surface.Well-made cultured marble, however, treated 
with reasonable care, can provide years of satisfactory service.</p> 
<p>With any sink, choose a bowl that is large enough for the intended use. A 
kitchen sink should be deep enough to handle large pots and have vertical sides 
and tight-radius corners to increase the usable space.</p> 
<p>A relatively flat bottom allows dishes to sit without sliding toward the 
drain, and an offset drain also increases the usable space. Models with 
multiple bowls and built-in cutting boards, draining racks, and other 
accessories can simplify both food prep at the sink and cleanup. A raised or 
gooseneck-type faucet allows large pots to be easily rinsed or filled (Figure 
6-48).</p> 
<p>Many &ldquo;builders&rsquo; grade&rdquo; lavatory sinks are undersized for 
basic grooming tasks, such as tooth brushing and face washing without splashing 
water across the vanity top.</p> 
<p>If the client plans to wash hair, water plants, or perform other household 
chores at the lavatory, an oversized bowl is recommended. A sink with the 
faucet offset to one side, with a pivoting spout, provides still more usable 
space.</p> 
<h3>Mounting Procedures for Sink Fixtures (Faucets)</h3> 
<p>Most kitchen and bath sinks are self-rimming and sit on top of the counter 
surface. However, demand has been growing for flush-set and under mount sinks, 
which cost more to buy and install, but have the benefits of a more streamlined 
appearance and easy cleaning (Figure 6-49).</p> 
<p>With the sink set level with or beneath the counter, food debris can be 
easily swept into the sink and grime does not collect at the joint of the sink 
rim and counter.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Self-rimming Sinks</strong>. Standard cast-iron and 
stainless-steel sinks have a metal flange that hides any rough cuts in the 
countertop but tends to collect grime where it joins the counter. The rim 
should be sealed to the counter with silicone sealant.</li> 
<li><strong>Flush-set Sinks</strong>. This type of sink, sometimes called a 
&ldquo;tile edge&rdquo; sink, is designed to sit level with the countertop and 
is often used with tile counters.With tile counters, a flexible sealant such as 
Color Caulk (Color Caulk, Colton, CA) should be used to seal between the sink 
and tile. Flush-set stainless-steel or cast-iron sinks can also be set into 
laminate counters by carefully routing a hole for the sink and using special 
trim that is virtually flush with the counter. European-based sink manufacturer 
Karran USA makes a reinforced solid surface sink specially designed to flush 
set in laminate tops.</li> 
<li><strong>Under mount Sinks and Basins</strong>. This type of sink provides 
the most streamlined appearance and easiest cleanup, but it is also the most 
costly to buy and install. Used with solid surfacing, stone, or composite tops, 
the cutout must be perfect, and most sinks must be independently supported from 
underneath the counter. Solid-surfacing sinks are typically glued to the 
countertop from underneath, creating a seamless transition.</li> </ul> 
<p>The main material choices for kitchen and bathroom sinks are outlined below 
(Table 6-9).</p> 
<h3>Enameled Steel Sink Choices</h3> 
<p>This uses the same process as enameled cast iron, but with a substrate of 
stamped 14-gauge steel. These sinks weigh half or less than a comparable 
cast-iron model, making them easier on the installer.</p> 
<p>But the lighter, less rigid substrate does not dampen noise as well and is 
more likely to chip if a heavy object is dropped. One alternative is a hybrid 
from American Standard called Americast, introduced in the late 1980s, which 
uses enameled steel on the inside and a cast-polymer composite on the outside 
to create a sturdy tub with half the weight of cast iron.</p> 
<h3>Solid Surfacing Sink Choices</h3> 
<p>The main advantage of solid-surface sinks is that they can be installed 
seamlessly to the underside of a solid-surface counters. This provides a very 
streamlined appearance, easy cleanup, and no joints to collect dirt.</p> 
<p>Solid surfacing also offers great design flexibility, as most fabricators 
can build nearly any configuration desired. Most solid surface sinks have a 
matte finish, which is easier to maintain than a semi gloss or high-gloss. 
While relatively easy to scratch or scorch, this type of damage is superficial 
and is easy to sand away with fine sandpaper or a 
ScotchBrite&acirc;&#132;&cent; pad.</p> 
<h3>Composite Sink Guide</h3> 
<p>Similar to solid surfacing, composite sinks are a cast polymer using 
crushed quartz or granite as the filler. High-quality composites have similar 
characteristics to engineered stone counters, and in some cases are seamlessly 
cast from the same material (Figure 6-50).</p> 
<p>In general, they provide excellent resistance against stains, scratches, 
chips, and fading. They also tolerate heat well. For example, the sinks made 
from Moenstone (Moen) and Kindred Granite (FHP Kindred) can tolerate 
temperatures up to 530&deg;F for short periods.</p> 
<p>Finishes range from matte to a satin semigloss. Cleaning instructions vary 
from manufacturer to manufacturer, but most recommend mild nonabrasive 
cleansers and nylon scrub pads for everyday cleaning and 
ScotchBrite&acirc;&#132;&cent; pads and abrasive cleansers as needed. Scratches 
or stubborn stains can be sanded out as with solid surfacing, although matching 
a glossy finish may be difficult (one solution is to sand the whole sink).</p> 
<p>Metal scouring pads or cast-iron cookware can leave rust stains on 
composite sinks. Concentrated bleaches, paint strippers, or products containing 
formic acid (drain cleaner) can discolor the surface. An application of 
Gel-Glos&acirc;&#132;&cent; (T.R. Industries) or Invisible Shield&reg; (Unelko 
Corp.) is recommended by some manufacturers to maintain the sheen and ease of 
cleaning.</p> 
<h3>Cultured Marble Sink Properties</h3> 
<p>See Table 6-9 for a discussion of the performance and care of cultured 
marble.</p> 
<h3>Vitreous China Sink Choices - Porcelain Sinks</h3> 
<p>Also called porcelain, vitreous china is a heavy ceramic product also used 
to make toilets. It is highly scratch-resistant and less affected by abrasive 
cleansers than enameled cast iron or cast-polymer materials (solid surfacing, 
stone composites). It is widely used in vanity sinks, but because the china 
substrate will chip more easily than other materials, it is not commonly used 
in kitchens. Some high end ornamental china sinks are available for kitchens, 
but may be too fragile for a kitchen work center.</p> 
<h3>Properties of Acrylic Sinks</h3> 
<p>A relative newcomer, acrylic sinks are made of the same materials as 
acrylic tubs or showers. Made from heat-molded 1/8 -inch thick acrylic plastic 
sheets, the fixtures are molded into a wide variety of shapes, then reinforced 
on the back side with fiberglass and resin. The surface is nonporous and very 
stain-resistant, but it is relatively soft and easy to scratch. It is also 
vulnerable to petroleum based chemicals and heat, for example from a hot 
skillet. Burns are not repairable.</p> 
<p>On the plus side, acrylic has good noise dampening characteristics and can 
tolerate bleach when needed for a difficult stain. The color goes all the way 
through the material, so it is possible to sand or buff out small scratches 
with auto polishing compound or special acrylic polish. For larger scratches, 
use 400- to 600-grit sandpaper and buff with baking soda.</p> 
<h3>Stainless Steel Sink Characteristics &amp; Recommendations</h3> 
<p>A basic stainless-steel sink is one of least expensive options, and one of 
the most durable. It is unaffected by heat and most chemicals and the surface 
will not absorb stains, odors, or oils. It is relatively easy to clean and can 
be scrubbed with abrasive cleansers and pads when needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid the cheapest sinks, which use lightweight steel (20 to 23 gauge), as 
they can flex or dent; also avoid low-nickel alloys, such as 18-8, which can 
tarnish. Lightweight steel sinks also tend to be noisy with a waste disposer. 
Good quality sinks are typically 18-gauge or thicker and use high-quality 
alloys, such as 18-10.</p> 
<p>Also avoid steel sinks with a polished finish, which is difficult to 
maintain. A brushed (matte) finish hides scratches from normal use and 
cleaning. And although good quality stainless is tough to damage, it is not 
indestructible. It can develop rust stains from steel wool residue or prolonged 
contact with cast iron cookware. Also, prolonged contact with concentrated 
bleach solutions, strong acids, or salty materials can cause pitting. Still, 
for function and economy, steel is hard to beat.</p> 
<h3>Enameled Cast Iron Sink Properties</h3> 
<p>The hard, glossy finish on a cast iron sink is made by fusing a porcelain 
enamel glaze to a heavy cast-iron substrate under high heat. This creates a 
solid fixture with a tough, lustrous finish that is impervious to stains, 
chemicals, odors, and heat, and cleans easily with a sponge.</p> 
<p>The heavy mass of the cast-iron base dampens any disposal sounds, but the 
same rigid mass will readily crack a dropped dish. The porcelain finish is 
durable but not indestructible. Harsh, abrasive cleansers and abrasive pads 
will dull the surface and a hard enough blow with a sharp object can chip the 
coating exposing the iron beneath to rust.</p> 
<h2>Guide to Choices of Tubs and Tub/Shower Units</h2> 
<p> The classic tub for many homeowners is still the rock solid, cast-iron 
model with a porcelain enamel finish. Driven by cost savings on both materials 
and installation, manufactures have introduced lighter-weight alternatives 
using molded plastics (Table 6-10).</p> 
<p>While not as hard as the original iron tubs, the plastic alternatives have 
improved over the years and provide great flexibility for designers.</p> 
<p>Most units include integral soap dishes, ledges, grab bars, and other 
molded features that help bathers and also provide rigidity to the unit. For 
new construction, most units are one-piece, creating a seamless, leak-free 
bathing enclosure (seeFigure 6-51).</p> 
<p> Retrofit tub/shower units typically have four or five pieces that fit 
together with sealant. The fewer pieces, the better.</p> 
<h3>Porcelain-Enameled Cast Iron Tub Properties</h3> 
<p>The classic tub material is very solid, very quiet, and resists scratches, 
chips, and stains. On the other hand it is very heavy, cold to the touch, and 
available only in pretty basic shapes. It does not easily mold into the 
body-hugging contours found on many of the plastic units.</p> 
<p>Although the surface is the most durable for molded tubs, it is not 
indestructible. If homeowners use abrasive cleansers and pads, over time the 
finish will dull.</p> 
<h3>Porcelain-Enameled Steel Bathtub Properties</h3> 
<p>This weighs less than cast-iron and feels less substantial, as the material 
has some give under the weight of water and bathers. It is also more prone to 
chip than cast iron.</p> 
<p>A hybrid alternative is American Standard&rsquo;s Americast, which is a 
porcelain enameled steel reinforced on the back with a cast polymer.</p> 
<p>The material is stiffer and quieter than regular enameled steel, but it is 
half the weight of cast iron. The company literature claims that the surface is 
more durable and slip resistant than standard porcelain enamel and that the 
composite layer helps retain heat.</p> 
<h3>Fiberglass Bath &amp; Shower Enclosure Properties &amp; Recommendations
</h3> 
<p>Also called FRP (fiberglass-reinforced plastic), or gel coat, this material 
is manufactured by spraying a thin coat of gel coat into a mold followed by 
several layers of polyester resin mixed with chopped fiberglass. Between coats, 
fabricators typically reinforce tub and shower walls and floors with blocks of 
wood or corrugated cardboard.</p> 
<p>One of the premium manufacturers of fiberglass tubs, Aqua Glass, uses a 
layer of rigid polyurethane foam between fiberglass coats, creating a stiffer 
assembly that helps the tub retain heat and deadens sound. The company also 
adds an antimicrobial compound to the gel coat to inhibit the growth of 
bacteria and mold. With any FRP tub, the thickness of the gel coat and 
thickness of the overall lay-up affect its strength and durability.</p> 
<p>One way to assess quality is to look for tubs that conform to the voluntary 
standard ANSI Z-124, which requires that a random sampling of acrylic and 
gel-coat tubs undergo a variety of durability tests.</p> 
<p>The thin gel coat can be damaged, but it is relatively easy to repair with 
gel-coat repair kits sold in marine and automotive stores. Color matching, 
however, can be difficult. Also if a chip is not repaired quickly, water can 
penetrate to the backing and cause the damage to spread.</p> 
<p>Overall, a gel-coat surface is less scratch- and stain-resistant than 
acrylic. Abrasive cleansers must not be used. Many manufacturers recommend an 
auto wax or special fiberglass bath wax available from tub suppliers.</p> 
<p>A proprietary FRP composite called Vikrell&acirc;&#132;&cent; (Sterling/ 
Kohler), makes tubs from a mix of resin, color, and chopped fiberglass molded 
under compression.</p> 
<p>The material has no gel coat or layers to chip or crack and has color all 
the way through. The manufacturer claims that the high gloss finish has the 
durability of acrylic and the ease of repair of fiberglass at roughly 40% less 
than the cost of acrylic.</p> 
<h3>Acrylic Bathtub &amp; Shower Properties</h3> 
<p>See description (above), under sink materials. One interesting high-end 
product called Armacryl (Kallista/Kohler) uses a thick clear layer of acrylic 
over a second color layer. Like other acrylic fixtures, it is reinforced with a 
fiberglass backing. The result is a lustrous and thick acrylic finish with 
excellent durability.</p> 
<h2>Guide to Choosing Soaking Tubs and Jetted Tubs</h2> 
<p> Material choices for jetted tubs and other oversized &ldquo;soaking&rdquo; 
tubs are the same as described above. However, with the added stress of higher 
water levels, multiple bathers, and the vibration of jets, the choice of 
material is more critical.</p> 
<p>The most durable type of tub, enameled cast iron, has limited offerings and 
are very heavy so they are not often used. Acrylic is an excellent choice, as 
are some of the proprietary materials, such as Americast (American Standard), 
Vikrell (Sterling/Kohler), and Armacryl (Kallista/ Kohler). A tub with a 
nonslip surface is recommended for safety.</p> 
<h3>Soaking or Jetted Tub Designs &amp; Shapes</h3> 
<p>Jetted tubs come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and depths and are 
designed for either a drop-in or niche installation with a tile flange. Typical 
rectangular or oval units range from 5 to 6 feet long, 32 to 45 inches wide, 
and 18 to 24 inches high, and many offer an optional skirt to finish the front 
and conceal the motor and plumbing. A drop-in requires a custom-built surround 
and requires more floor space (seeFigure 6-52).</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Tub-showers</strong>. Some models are available as tub shower 
combos and others can be adapted for use as a tub/shower. However, most designs 
do not lend themselves to showering due to placement of controls, impractical 
shapes for doors or curtains, high walls, and rounded interiors. A hand-held 
shower is always an option.</li> 
<li><strong>Primary bath</strong>. If this is the home&rsquo;s only tub, be 
aware that deep tubs with a wide top edge or tile ledge can be awkward for 
bathing small children. Also pay attention to the number of gallons required to 
take a bath, often double the volume of a standard tub.</li> 
<li><strong>Two-person</strong>. For two people, look for a tub with a center 
drain, or a triangular corner model. Taller people will generally need larger 
tubs to stretch out.</li> 
<li><strong>Tight spaces or retrofits</strong>. Many manufacturers make a 
tapered model designed to replace a standard 30x60&acirc;&#128;&#147;inch tub. 
Corner models can also save space in a tight layout.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Noise Issues with Jetted Tubs &amp; Spas</h3> 
<p>Jetted tubs can be rather noisy. If this is a concern, look for a unit with 
flexible hoses connected to the pump, which helps reduce the vibration and 
noise transmitted to the tub. Some manufacturers also offer quieter jet 
mechanisms as an upgrade.</p> 
<h3>Types of Jets Used in Whirlpools &amp; Spas or Tubs</h3> 
<p>Some manufacturers offer different types of jets with different flow 
characteristics. Some circulate air, some water, and some both, producing the 
most vigorous massage.</p> 
<p> It is best to try out a system at a showroom if possible. Also pay 
attention to jet locations. Jets high and on the sides will provide swirling 
water, while jets placed where bathers will sit and directed toward the back 
and other stress points will provide a more effective massage. Some 
manufacturers will customize jet locations. Other options to consider are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Recessed jets</strong> that do not protrude </li> 
<li><strong>Individually adjustable jets</strong>, including on-off controls 
</li> 
<li><strong>An in-line heater</strong> if long soaks are desired </li> 
<li><strong>A built-in cleaning system</strong> to keep the internal plumbing 
free from mold and other residues.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Mechanicals: Pumps &amp; Heaters for Whirlpools, Jetted Tubs, Spas</h3> 
<p>Pumps are usually located at the opposite end from the drain and fill area. 
Some manufacturers allow the buyer to specify the pump location for better 
access. Look for a pump with automatic protection against burn-out if 
accidentally run dry. Pumps range from 1/2 to 3 horsepower, and many 
manufacturers offer a horsepower upgrade for a modest price increase, often a 
worthwhile expense.</p> 
<p>The pump comes with a cord and plug that requires a GFCI-protected 
receptacle. Since the receptacle is inaccessible, it should be either 
downstream of an accessible GFCI-receptacle or on a circuit with a GFCI 
breaker. Locate the receptacle where it does not block access to the pump. To 
ensure safety, make sure that the unit purchased is UL-listed for the entire 
system, not just the individual components.</p> 
<h3>Heaters for Whirlpools &amp; Spas or Tubs</h3> 
<p>If the occupants expect to take long soaks in the tub, an accessory heater 
is advisable. Energy-efficient models capture waste heat from the motor and 
pump to provide a modest degree of supplemental heat, while others use a 
conventional electrical heating element that can maintain the water temperature 
indefinitely. For installations where the volume of the tub exceeds the 
capacity of the home&rsquo;s water heater, some manufacturers offer an 
instantaneous water heater that will heat the water as it enters the tub.</p> 
<h2>Installation Recommendations for Whirlpools &amp; Spas or Tubs</h2> 
<p>The simplest and least expensive installation is into a two-wall or 
three-wall cove with factory-supplied skirts to conceal the mechanicals. 
However, many customers prefer the look of a drop-in model with a custom tile 
surround (seeFigure 6-53).</p> 
<p>With either type of installation, it is critical that the weight of the tub 
be supported by the base, not the lip.With larger tubs, often holding 50 to 80 
gallons of water (at 8 pounds per gallon), the framing and subfloor may need to 
be reinforced to support the total weight of the tub, water, and bathers. A 
larger water heater may also be needed.</p> 
<p>The most common method to support the tub bottom and dampen vibration is to 
set the tub onto several small mounds of wet plaster or mortar mix that 
compress and conform to the shape of the tub bottom as it is installed. A non 
shrinking grout such as Sonogrout 10K (Sonneborn) is best since it will not 
leave gaps as it dries.</p> 
<p>Partially filling the tub with water until the mortar sets will ensure a 
good fit. Many contractors recommend using mortar even with units including 
&ldquo;self-leveling&rdquo; bases, which are designed to sit on a level 
subfloor with no additional support.</p> 
<p>A few tubs are designed with individual bearing points molded into the 
bottom of the tub. With this type, it is important to make sure that the 
bearing points fall on joists or solid blocking. Solid bridging should also be 
added to help distribute the load to the surrounding joists.</p> 
<h3>Access Panel Designs for Whirlpool Baths, Jetted Tubs, Spas</h3> 
<p>With a custom-built surround, it is necessary to leave an access panel. 
Although access to the mechanicals is rarely needed, it should not require 
tearing apart the tile surround.</p> 
<p>A simple approach is to tile the access panel, hang it with magnets, and 
caulk the joint between the access panel and surrounding tiles. If access is 
necessary, the caulk can be slit with a knife and the panel removed. Where the 
tub rim meets tile at a wall or the top of the surround, use a flexible caulk 
rather than grout, which will crack as the tub flexes, and expands and 
contracts with temperature changes.</p> 
<h2>Design Guide to Choosing Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Faucets</h2> 
<p> Manufacturers offer a vast array of faucet styles and finishes. Most 
homeowners choose single-level models for the convenience of one-handed 
control, and chrome remains the most popular finish because of its durability 
and easy cleaning. New finishing technologies permit nearly any color or 
metallic finish with similar durability. Most faucets also have improved valve 
systems that make leaky faucets a thing of the past.</p> 
<h3>Finish Choices for Faucets</h3> 
<p>Most faucet finishes are guaranteed for life. Chrome, the most popular 
choice, is easy to clean and very resistant to scratching. For a colored 
finish, the best choice is an epoxy coating. These come in a wide range of 
colors and are also very durable and easy to maintain, but they can be 
scratched with an abrasive scouring pad. Also solvents, such as nail polish 
remover (acetone), can soften the epoxy coating.</p> 
<p>Many higher-end faucets now use a new high-tech plating technology called 
physical-vapor deposition or PVD, which can imitate almost any metallic finish 
from brass to pewter to gold. PVD finishes are as hard as chrome and easy to 
maintain, although they can be stained by drain cleansers containing lye. Also, 
abrasive pads, such as steel wool or ScotchBrite&reg;, can scratch these or any 
finish with enough effort. Where scratching is a concern, a brushed or satin 
finish is preferable, since it will help conceal scratches.</p> 
<p>Solid brass faucets usually come with a lacquer or similar coating to 
protect against tarnishing. The metal will tarnish, however, when the coating 
eventually wears off or where it gets scratched. As an alternative, many 
manufacturers now offer &ldquo;tarnish-free brass&rdquo; finishes using PVD 
technology. Marketed under a variety of names, these finishes are actually 
applied over a chrome-plated faucet and have the durability of chrome.</p> 
<h3>A Guide to Kitchen &amp; Bath Faucet Styles</h3> 
<p>Most homeowners find single-handle faucets more convenient, and experts 
consider them safer for kids than separate hot and cold levers, which are more 
likely to cause a scalding injury. Whatever style is chosen, levers are easier 
to manipulate than knobs, particularly for anyone with restricted mobility. 
Lavatory faucets should be low enough that they do not hit people in the head 
if they lean down to wash their face. An offset faucet or one that swings out 
of the way can provide greater useful space.</p> 
<p>The faucet spout in a kitchen should be high enough to accommodate large 
pots and long enough to reach all the basins in a multi basin model. One that 
swings out of the way can increase the useful space. High-arch or gooseneck 
designs are often a good solution (seeFigure 6-48).</p> 
<p>Pullout spray spouts are also very convenient, but avoid those with flimsy 
plastic hoses. Look for a durable double interlock hose that will not kink.</p> 
<p>Details about anti-scald protection and devices are found at MIXING / 
ANTI-SCALD VALVES.</p> 
<h3>Guide to Bathroom or Kitchen Faucet Materials</h3> 
<p>Underneath the finish, the base material for most faucet bodies is brass, 
zinc, steel, or cheap alloys called &ldquo;pot metal.&rdquo; Some economy 
models use plastic.</p> 
<p>The highest-quality faucets use solid forged or machined brass, which will 
last the longest and require the least care, particularly in areas with hard 
water. Cast brass is also used, but it is not quite as durable. Midrange 
faucets use brass or chrome plating on zinc alloys, which provides good 
durability, but must be replaced when the plating wears through. Plastic, 
steel, and pot-metal bodies are usually the least durable.</p> 
<h3>Valve Types Used in Bathroom or Kitchen Faucets</h3> 
<p>The faucet valve is the mechanism that regulates the flow of water when you 
turn the lever or knob. There are four basic types, each with pros and cons.</p>
<ul> 
<li><strong>Compression valves</strong> are the old standby used in 
traditional two-handle faucets. These have a rubber washer on the bottom of a 
threaded stem, which opens and closes as the knob is twisted. The washers wear 
out over time, more quickly with hard water or over tightening. New washers 
cost less than a dollar and are generally easy to replace. The metal valve 
seats also get worn over time and need to be ground with fine sandpaper to 
prevent leaks.</li> 
<li><strong>Sleeve-cartridges</strong> have a hollow stem that rotates inside 
a metal or plastic sleeve to control the water flow in both one- and two-handle 
faucets. Usually the whole cartridge is replaced when it leaks, although 
replacing the O-ring at the top or bottom of the cartridge may work. Most 
cartridges are easy to replace, but some faucets require a special tool to pry 
out the cartridge. Choose brass cartridges, rather than plastic, if available. 
Replacements cost $15 to $20.</li> 
<li><strong>Ball valves</strong>. Developed originally by Delta, these are 
still widely used in single-lever faucets. They use a hollow brass or plastic 
ball with spring-loaded seals to control water flow. Ball valves last a long 
time, and replacement parts are inexpensive (under $10), but the small parts 
can be tricky to assemble. Brass replacement parts will outlast plastic.</li> 
<li><strong>Ceramic-disk cartridges</strong>. Considered the most reliable 
approach, this new type of valve uses hard ceramic disks that rotate in a 
cartridge until the holes line up to release water. The polished disks are 
nearly indestructible, but eventually the grease between the disks washes out 
or the washers or O-rings wear out. Typically, the whole cartridge is replaced. 
This is a simple operation, which costs about $10 to $20 for parts.<br>
<br>

<strong>Watch out</strong>: while most faucet manufacturers do a great job of 
stocking replacement and repair parts for faucets, once the faucet is 
installed, the cost of repair parts may approach the cost of installing an 
entirely new faucet assembly. We found that some brands (including 
Kohler&trade;) can list stunning prices for small replacement parts for 
faucets, cartridges, and handles - DF.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Guide to Scald Protection for Bathrooms, Tubs, Showers</h2> 
<p><strong>Details about anti-scald protection and devices are found at
</strong> MIXING / ANTI-SCALD VALVES. Excerpts are below.</p> 
<p>There are many styles of mixer valves in tubs and showers, but all should 
have some sort of protection against scalding. The young and elderly are at 
greatest risk due to thinner skin and slower reaction times. More than 35,000 
children, most under age six, are treated each year in emergency rooms for 
tap-water scald burns, according to the National Safe Kids Campaign.</p> 
<p>A child exposed to 140&deg;F water for as little as three seconds can 
sustain a third-degree burn requiring hospitalization and skin grafts. Although 
most scald burns occur in the kitchen, according to the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, the most severe scald burns are caused by water flowing into the 
tub or shower. In response, many state and local codes now require antiscald 
protection in residential tubs and showers.</p> 
<p>Many organizations advocate setting water heaters to no more than 
120&deg;F, which gives bathers significantly more time to move away or adjust 
the temperature before a burn occurs. While this strategy is helpful, it is not 
always reliable and can cause other problems:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Noncompliance</strong>: many homeowners turn the thermostats up to 
increase supply.</li> 
<li><strong>Water heater thermostats are often inaccurate</strong>. The ANSI 
standard for gas water heaters allows the temperature to vary by plus-or-minus 
10&deg;F.</li> 
<li><strong>Stacking effect</strong>: water at the top of a gas water heater 
can exceed the set point by as much as 30&deg;F.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Use of Water Pressure-Balancing Valves to Control Temperature &amp; Avoid 
Scalding</h3> 
<p>This is the most commonly used point-of-supply approach. These 
automatically adjust the water pressure to maintain the mix of hot and cold 
water to within 2&deg;F to 3&deg;F of where the user set the shower control. If 
cold water is diverted to a flushing toilet or other appliance and the pressure 
drops, the valve automatically reduces the hot water flow proportionately to 
maintain the temperature.</p> 
<p> If the cold water pressure plummets or stops altogether, the flow is 
reduced to a trickle. To guard against someone accidentally turning the shower 
valve to scalding temperatures, these valves typically use a temperature limit 
stop that prevents the user from turning the shower control past a set 
point&acirc;&#128;&#148;typically set at or below 120&deg;F.</p> 
<h3>Use of Thermostatic Mixing Valves to Avoid Scalding Burns</h3> 
<p>These are more expensive than pressure-balancing valves and not widely used 
in the United States. They can be installed either inline near the water heater 
or as part of the shower control. The inline type of valve, also called a 
tempering valve, adds cold water to the hot water as it leaves the water heater 
to maintain a constant temperature, set by the installer. These are commonly 
used with solar water heaters but can also be tied to a conventional water 
heater.</p> 
<p>A check valve is required on the cold water side to prevent backflow, and a 
hot-water expansion tank is recommended to prevent excessive pressure on the 
hot water side.</p> 
<p>The other type of thermostatic valve is built into some high-end showers (
Figure 6-54). These allow the user to set the temperature on a dial when 
showering. The unit will compensate for changes in either pressure or 
temperature to maintain a constant delivery temperature and flow rate. If the 
cold water fails or the tempered water is still too hot for any reason, the 
unit will shut off the flow.</p> 
<p>As with the pressure-balancing valve, the installer sets a temperature 
limit stop to prevent the user from turning the shower control to scalding 
temperatures.</p> 
<h3>Retrofits to Avoid Scalding Burns at Plumbing Fixtures</h3> 
<p>In retrofits, point-of-use devices can be installed by a plumber or 
homeowner to limit water temperatures to 120&deg;F. These include antiscald 
showerheads, as well as point-of-use devices that fit into individual plumbing 
fixtures, such as showerheads and bath and sink faucets.</p> 
<p>For example, MemrySafe and ScaldShield (Antiscald Inc.) are inexpensive 
retrofit devices that reduce the water flow to less than 1/4 gallon per minute 
when the water temperature at the faucet or showerhead exceeds 120&deg;F. These 
devices do not regulate temperature or pressure, but do offer protection 
against serious burns.</p> 
<h2>Design Choices &amp; Alternatives for Toilets</h2> 
<p> When water-saving toilets were first introduced in the 1980s, they reduced 
water usage from 5 to 6 gallons per flush (gpf) to 3.5 with little effect on 
performance.</p> 
<p>However, when Congress mandated in 1992 that manufacturers had two years to 
reduce water usage to 1.6 gpf, the engineering challenges were much greater. 
Most early models were essentially 3.5 gallon designs hastily modified with 
smaller tanks and narrower trapways intended to increase the flow rate. Most 
did not work well and required two and sometimes three flushes, negating much 
of the benefit to water conservation.</p> 
<p>Better design and new technologies have led to greatly improved performance 
in some models. In addition to traditional gravity designs, two types of 
pressurized designs have been introduced: pressure-assisted and 
vacuum-assisted. Both types benefit from the additional flushing power. 
However, with the pressure-assisted, the increased flush comes with increased 
noise and complexity (Table 6-11).</p> 
<p>Because there is no standardized testing, figuring out which models perform 
well is difficult. Test results on individual models performed by the National 
Association of Home Builders, Consumer Reports, and other groups are a useful 
guide, but results are not consistent due to differing test methods. While all 
toilets sold in the United States must meet the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers (ASME) performance standard A112.119.2M, this only guarantees basic 
functionality.</p> 
<h3>Operating Properties Gravity-Flush Toilets</h3> 
<p>This is the traditional method, which relies on water dropping from the 
tank to cleanse the bowl and start a siphon action in the trapway. Although the 
first low-flow gravity toilets had trouble, many of the newer models have been 
re engineered with higher tanks and larger trapways to improve the flush.</p> 
<p>Some store three or more gallons in the tank to create greater pressure, 
but only let 1.6 gallons drain in each flush. One side benefit to this approach 
is less sweating in hot weather, since only a portion of the water in the tank 
is replaced with new cold water.</p> 
<p>Gravity-flush models are generally easy to maintain, although they are a 
little more finicky than older 3.5 gallon models. For example, the water level 
must be accurately set for them to work as designed and worn out flapper valves 
must be replaced with the proper model rather than a generic one.</p> 
<p>Among the gravity flush models that consistently rated well in independent 
tests are any of the Toto models that use its G-Max flushing system and the 
Kohler Wellworth and Santa Rosa.</p> 
<h3>Operating Characteristics of Power-Assisted Toilets</h3> 
<p>Widely used in commercial settings, these toilets have a sealed chamber in 
the tank that fills after each flush, using the home&rsquo;s water pressure to 
compress the air trapped inside.With each flush, the compressed air forces the 
water down into the bowl with a loud whoosh, which is the primary complaint 
about these models. As long as household water pressure is at least 25 psi, 
these are very effective at clearing the bowl.</p> 
<p>Because of the tank within a tank, there is no sweating on the outside of 
the porcelain, but condensation and mildew can form on the surface of the 
power-assist unit. While these toilets are not for everyone, they are 
particularly useful in retrofits where drainage is a problem, for example, 
where venting is inadequate or where the toilet sits at the end of a long 
drainage run with no fixtures upstream to wash the line.</p> 
<p>When these toilets malfunction, the complete pressure-assisted unit is 
replaced. Power-assisted toilets cost about $100 to $150 more than comparable 
gravity models.</p> 
<p>Examples of top-rate power-assisted toilet models include the Crane 
Economiser, American Standard Cadet PA, and Gerber Ultra Flush.</p> 
<h3>Operating Characteristics of Vacuum-Assisted Toilets</h3> 
<p>A relatively new design, these also have a sealed chamber. With each flush, 
a partial vacuum is created in the chamber, which connects to the trapway with 
tubing. The vacuum boosts the suction during the next flush, achieving a 
powerful flush but without the noise of a power-assisted unit.</p> 
<p>Vacuum-assisted toilets use the same flush and fill valves as gravity flush 
toilets, making them easy to maintain. Only a few models are currently on the 
market, but they have performed very well in tests and are moderately priced at 
$50 to $100 more than comparable gravity models.</p> 
<p>Among the top-rated models are the Briggs Vacuity 4200 and the Crane VIP 
Flush 3999.</p> 
<h3>One-Piece vs. Two-Piece Toilets</h3> 
<p>One-piece units tend to have low sleek lines and cost substantially more 
than standard two-piece models where the tank is bolted to the bowl during 
installation (Figure 6-55).</p> 
<p> One-piece models are generally easier to clean, since there are fewer 
crevices between the bowl and tank to collect dirt. With gravity flush toilets, 
it is harder for designers to achieve a sufficient head of water without the 
height of a standard tank, although redesigning other components has overcome 
this in at least some models.</p> 
<h3>Sweating (Condensation) Problems on Toilets</h3> 
<p>In humid areas with cold incoming water, sweating on the outside of the 
porcelain tank can be a significant problem, in some cases rotting the flooring 
around the toilets. Some of the new flushing strategies alleviate the problem 
somewhat:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>In gravity toilets</strong> that store 3 or more gallons of water 
in the tank, the incoming 1.6 gallons of cold water is tempered by the retained 
water in the tank.</li> 
<li><strong>In pressure-assisted toilets</strong>, the incoming water resides 
in a small tank within the larger porcelain tank, so the porcelain tank is not 
chilled. However, condensation can form around the inner tank, leading to mold 
growth.</li> </ul> 
<p>One approach to avoiding &quot;sweating&quot; or condensation problems with 
older toilets is to add special foam insulation inserts inside the tank. These 
may not work with low-flow designs, however. Also this does not prevent 
dripping from the bowl or water supply line. Where the problem persists, 
consider added an anti sweat valve (Beacon Valves) that tempers the incoming 
cold water with a little bit of hot water to bring it up to room temperature.
</p> 
<h2>Installation Procedures &amp; Details for Toilets</h2> 
<p>Before installing a toilet, examine it for manufacturing defects that can 
cause leaks or prevent it from sealing fully to the closet flange. Occasionally 
the inlet where the tank connects to the bowl, or the outlet (horn) at the 
bottom of the bowl that seals to the closet flange, is deformed enough to cause 
problems.</p> 
<p>Also make sure the base (foot) of the toilet is flat or it will have a 
tendency to rock and break the seal, leading to odors and leakage.</p> 
<p>Next, make sure the framing is adequate. Ideally the toilet should sit 
between two joists set no more than 12 inches on-center, with blocking nailed 
on either side of the drain to reinforce the area around the closet flange (
Figure 6-56). This will limit any movement in the fixture that could break the 
seal at the wax ring.</p> 
<p>The hole in the subfloor should be just a bit larger than the drain. Also, 
it is best if the toilet sits on top of the finished flooring rather than 
having a dirt-trapping joint where the finished floor abuts the fixture.</p> 
<p>Next, install the closet flange and secure it to the subfloor with brass or 
stainless-steel screws. With vinyl flooring, the flange can sit directly on the 
subfloor. With tile, use a plywood spacer to raise the flange to the height of 
the tile. To insure longevity, use brass closet bolts, nuts, and washers rather 
than the plated steel that is often packaged with the toilet. Then place the 
wax ring in the closet flange and set the bowl in place.</p> 
<p>Gradually tighten the nuts on the closet bolts, alternating from one side 
to the other until it is snug without over tightening. Finally, apply a bead of 
silicone caulk around the sides and front of the toilet foot, leaving the back 
unsealed. This will allow leaks to be spotted before serious damage develops.

<h2>Design Recommendations for Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Ventilation</h2> 
<p> Kitchens and bathrooms are key sources of indoor moisture and other 
pollutants. Kitchens produce particulates and atomized grease from cooking, and 
with a gas range, they also produce combustion by-products including nitrogen 
dioxide and carbon monoxide. Bathrooms produce moisture, odors, and VOCs from 
aerosols and various personal hygiene products. Effective spot ventilation in 
these areas is critical for maintaining healthy levels of indoor humidity 
levels and an overall healthy indoor environment (seeINDOOR AIR QUALITY 
IMPROVEMENT GUIDE.</p> 
<h2>Bathroom Ventilation Design Recommendations</h2> 
<p> Bathroom ventilation should be powerful enough to remove excess moisture 
before it has time to condense on cold walls and windows, potentially damaging 
finishes, or escape into wall or ceiling cavities, where it may lead to decay 
or peeling paint.</p> 
<h3>Ventilation Rate Required for Bathrooms</h3> 
<p>The minimum ventilation rate for bathrooms required by the 2003 
International Residential Code (IRC) is 50 cfm intermittent or 20 cfm 
continuous (if part of a whole-house ventilation system). While this may be 
adequate for a small bath, the guidelines of the Home Ventilating Institute 
(HVI) are more suitable for larger rooms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Small baths</strong>: For bathrooms up to 100 sq ft, HVI 
recommends using an exhaust fan that provides 1 cfm per square foot of floor 
space. This will provide approximately 8 air changes per hour. So, for example, 
an 8x10-foot bathroom would require 80 cfm of ventilation.</li> 
<li><strong>Large baths</strong>: For bathrooms over 100 sq ft, the HVI 
recommends a ventilation rate based on the number and type of fixtures as shown 
inTable 6-12. For example, a bathroom with a toilet, shower, and jetted tub 
would require 200 cfm (50 + 50 + 100) of ventilation either in a single fan or 
multiple fans placed over the fixtures being vented.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Bath Fan Noise Issues</h3> 
<p>The biggest homeowner objection to bath fans, their noise, has been 
addressed with the introduction of whisper-quiet bath fans from a number of 
manufacturers. Choose the quietest fan for the job, preferably one rated 1.5 
sones or less (one sone roughly equals the sound of a quiet refrigerator motor).
</p> 
<h3>Recommendations for Bathroom Fan Location</h3> 
<p>For optimal ventilation, locate the exhaust grilles near the source to be 
ventilated, typically over the tub or shower. In smaller baths, a single, 
central exhaust point is usually adequate, while in larger baths, multiple 
smaller fans (or a remote fan with separate pickups) will be more effective.</p>
<p>Bathrooms with enclosed toilet areas or steam showers should have separate 
exhaust grilles in those areas. Since all exhaust fans require makeup air, the 
bathroom door needs to be undercut to provide makeup air when bathroom windows 
are closed.</p> 
<h3>Advice for Bath Fan Controls</h3> 
<p> The Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) recommends that a fan be left on for 
20 minutes after use of a bath or shower to remove all excess moisture from the 
room and ductwork. A timer switch is the simplest way to accomplish this. 
Another option is a de humidistat switch, which will automatically operate the 
fan whenever the humidity level rises above a preset level. A manual override 
allows normal operation of the fan for other bathroom uses.</p> 
<h3>Bath Fan Ductwork Specifications</h3> 
<p>A ventilating fan must overcome the resistance, called &ldquo;static 
pressure,&rdquo; created by the ductwork, including transitions, elbows, and 
the wall or roof cap. The advertised airflow of bath fans is typically based on 
a static pressure of 0.1 (inches of water gauge) although some also publish the 
airflow rating at 0.25 inches, which gives a better estimate of actual airflow 
in most installations.</p> 
<p>A static pressure of 0.1 is roughly equivalent to 15 feet of straight, 
smooth 4-inch duct with a 100 cfm fan. A typical installation with about 20 
feet of duct, two elbows, and a wall cap has an equivalent duct length closer 
to 80 feet (seeTable 6-13).</p> 
<p>How well a particular fan can overcome the ductwork&rsquo;s resistance to 
airflow is highly variable and is indicated by its fan curve, available from 
the manufacturer. Inline fans mounted remotely and exterior fans are generally 
the most powerful.</p> 
<p>A typical installation with two elbows and 20 to 30 feet of duct reduces 
the rated airflow of a standard fan by anywhere from 10 to 30%. With long runs, 
multiple elbows, or corrugated flex duct, airflow may be reduced by 50% or 
more. To ensure good airflow, follow these guidelines:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Use smooth ductwork</strong> of the same size or slightly larger 
than the fan outlet. Thin-walled PVC pipe works well and is easy to seal.</li> 
<li><strong>Keep duct runs as short and straight</strong> as possible.</li> 
<li><strong>Where possible, use broad sweeps</strong> rather than 90-degree 
angles to change direction.</li> 
<li><strong>Seal all joints</strong> in metal duct with foil-backed tape or 
duct mastic, not cloth duct tape.</li> 
<li><strong>For a standard installation</strong>, choose a slightly larger fan 
size than required. Where duct runs exceed about 25 feet plus two elbows, 
choose a larger fan size and check the fan curve to determine actual airflow.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Condensation in ductwork</strong> is also a concern in cold 
climates. To avoid problems, insulate the ductwork to at least R-5 or run it 
below the ceiling insulation. Also keep any metal duct seams facing upward and 
slope the duct slightly toward the exterior outlet so that any condensation 
drains to the outside. Avoid any sags in the ductwork, which are potential 
pooling areas for condensation.</p> 
<h2>Kitchen Ventilation Design Guide</h2> 
<p>Kitchen cooktops produce large amounts of water vapor, atomized grease, 
particulates, and cooking odors. In addition, gas cooktops produce combustion 
by-products, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide, and 
carbon monoxide (see &ldquo;Combustion Appliances,&rdquo; ). The most effective 
way to remove the moisture and contaminants from a cooktop is with an overhead 
range hood vented to the outdoors. Unvented range hoods offer no protection 
against moisture and combustion gases and provide only minimal protection 
against grease, smoke, and odors trapped by the filter.</p> 
<h3>Kitchen Range Hood Location Advice</h3> 
<p>Research at the University of Minnesota has shown that many range hoods are 
too small, too high, or not oriented properly to do their job well. According 
to the study, the most effective range hoods are at least as wide as the 
cooktop and rectangular rather than angled in front.</p> 
<p>For best performance, standard hoods should be mounted no more than 24 
inches above the cooking surface and project out at least 20 inches from the 
wall (seeFigure 6-57).</p> 
<p>Some high-capacity ventilators are designed to work from 24 to 30 inches 
above the cooking surface, but the stronger fans increase the risk of 
backdrafting other combustion appliances. Hoods integrated with microwaves 
typically project out only 13 to 15 inches and miss most of the contaminants 
generated by the front burners.</p> 
<h3>Required Kitchen Fan Ventilation Rate</h3> 
<p>The minimum ventilation rate for kitchens required by the 2003 
International Residential Code is 100 cfm intermittent or 25 cfm continuous (if 
part of a whole-house ventilation system).</p> 
<p>Most industry experts recommend that overhead range hoods have a minimum 
capacity of 150 cfm and recommend higher capacity fans for open grilling, 
high-BTU commercial-style ranges, and other cooking styles that generate 
greater than average steam or smoke (seeTable 6-14).</p> 
<p>A rule of thumb for high-output ranges is 1 cfm of ventilation per 100 
BTU&rsquo;s of output. With high-powered fans, multi speed controls are best so 
the fan speed (and noise) can be lowered when full power is not required.</p> 
<h3>Installation Specifications for Kitchen Island Hoods</h3> 
<p>Island hoods are typically installed at least 27 inches above the cook 
surface so they do not interfere with sight lines. Because they are farther 
from the cooktop and subject to passing air currents, they require more 
powerful fans than standard wall-mounted hoods. HVI recommendations for 
wall-mounted and island hoods are shown inTable 6-14.</p> 
<h3>Downdraft Fans for Kitchens</h3> 
<p>Because they lack a canopy to catch contaminants and must overcome natural 
convection, downdraft fans are less effective than overhead range hoods. 
Typically sized at 400 to 600 cfm or more, they do a reasonable job of venting 
barbecues and grills, but are less effective with pots and pans taller than 
about 3 inches. Downdraft fans are either flush-mounted at counter level or pop 
up about 8 inches at the back of the range.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Flush-mounted fans</strong> are typically located in the center of 
the cooktop or to one side. They generally do an adequate job of capturing 
combustion gases, as well as water vapor and cooking odors from pans 3 inches 
or shorter. Vapors from taller pots tend to escape.</li> 
<li><strong>Pop-up fans </strong>in the rear do an adequate job of capturing 
combustion gases and moisture, except for tall pots on the front burners.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Kitchen Vent Fan Noise Ratings &amp; Advice</h3> 
<p>Look for the unit with the lowest noise rating that meets the ventilation 
requirements. Some hoods are rated as low as 2.5 sones, although most range 
from 4 to 7 sones at full power (one sone roughly equals the sound of one quiet 
refrigerator).</p> 
<h3>Ductwork Suggestions for Kitchen Fans</h3> 
<p>Like bathroom fans, the airflow from kitchen exhaust fans is generally 
rated at a static pressure of 0.1 in. (see &ldquo;Ductwork,&rdquo; page 262). 
This is roughly equivalent to 30 feet of smooth 7-inch round or 3 1/4x10 in. 
metal duct venting a 200 cfm fan. For good performance, the total equivalent 
duct length, not counting the wall or roof cap, should not exceed about 30 
feet. Equivalent duct lengths for common fittings are shown inTable 6-15.</p> 
<h3>Backdrafting &amp; Safety Issues with Exhaust Fans</h3> 
<p>With large-capacity exhaust fans of 200 cfm or greater, there is a risk of 
causing backdrafting of a fireplace or atmospherically vented boiler, furnace, 
or water heater. The potential for backdrafting can be tested by a heating 
system technician and should be conducted with all household exhaust fans 
running to simulate the worst-case scenario. A simple preliminary test can be 
done by holding a stick of incense next to the draft diverter or dilution port 
of each combustion appliance with the furnace fan on and off.</p> 
<p>If the smoke spills into the room for more than 30 seconds, then dedicated 
makeup air is most likely required. Modest amounts of makeup air can be 
delivered through a passive duct with an automatic damper, but significant 
depressurization may require an active supply fan. The makeup air supply should 
be delivered into the kitchen or a nearby room not blocked by a door. (For more 
information,<strong>see &ldquo;Backdrafting,&rdquo; page 295</strong>).</p> <br>
