<p>When they fill in, this will be a bubbling cauldron of succulents (Nicole

<p>As spring marches onwards, now is when gardeners look at empty pots and 
planters and think about what to put inside them. Container plantings are 
perfect for gardeners with limited outdoor space, and they're great for making 
entrances, decks, and patios feel more welcoming.</p> 
<p>Traditionally, containers gardens are designed with annuals, using 
something tall in the back, a trailing plant in the front, and a medium height 
plant with colorful flowers in the center. These mixed containers look 
fantastic, but lately I've been looking for a new formula.</p> 
<p>This is because except for driving a Hummer, to me nothing says 
pre-recession like a big container of expensive annuals that have to be 
replaced several times a year. These displays aren't seen that often anymore, 
and when I come across them I have a flashback to 2007 and the pre-Lehmann 
Brothers, pre-Bernie Madoff days.</p> 
<p>The past few years I've been experimenting with containers filled mostly 
with plants I've divided from my garden, and while the effect may be subtle, it 
can be very effective. A big benefit here is that perennials and even shrubs in 
containers will overwinter and come back bigger and better in subsequent years.
</p> 
<p>The key is to choose plants for their foliage, not their flowers. Most 
perennials have a short bloom season, so the leaves need to hold the interest 
for the rest of the year. Interesting hostas are great in containers, as are 
heucheras. I plunked one of each into two containers on my neighbor's shady 
landing a few years ago and they're still going strong and look great. I'm not 
sure she's ever watered them.</p> 
<p>You can also try evergreens as an anchor in your containers, and fill in 
with some small plants seasonally. I have a dwarf Japanese pine tree in a big 
pot that looks good all year, especially in winter, and another pot planted 
with a 'Sky Pencil' Japanese holly with space around it for annuals (I do still 
like annuals, even if I don't use them that much.)</p> 
<p>Houseplants like fancy-leaved geraniums and different succulents can also 
work in outside containers. Stems of both these can be snapped off the parent 
plant and stuck directly in the dirt, where they will form roots quickly. A few 
weeks ago I filled a big copper kettle from a flea market with soil and planted 
the top with jade plants, aloe, sedums, and echeverias that had been in 
different pots in the house during the winter. They should fill in soon, and 
next fall I'll pull them out and bring them back inside again.</p> 
<p>Having almost exhausted the topic and the reader here, I'll just add that 
lastly, it's worth considering that the container makes as much of an impact as 
what's inside it. Using a cheap plastic planter is fine, but you may want 
something more attractive and more permanent like terra cotta, ceramic, or 
metal, all of which should last for many years. If you browse yard sales, flea 
markets and thrift shops you might find some good deals and unique containers 
to use as planters.</p> 
<p>Oddly, it's actually been more fun to design containers using what I 
already have in the ground and in the house than what I find in the store. 
Maybe we should start a movement, and call it recession gardening.</p> <br>

 ABOUT NICOLE JUDAY <br>
Nicole Juday started 
gardening when she became the owner of an overgrown yard and realized she 
didn&rsquo;t know the names of anything growing in it. A desire to learn the 
basics of gardening eventually led to a career change, and the has worked in 
the horticultural field for more than a decade. Today she keeps chickens and 
bees, grows a lot of flowers, and writes and speaks about gardening and natural 
history. See what else she&rsquo;s up to at&nbsp;www.nicolejuday.com.<br>
