 I have recently been gifted 
with an orchid and a peace lily. I've never owned either of these plants so I'm 
needing to learn about their care. From a Google search for peace lily, I 
gather that they pretty much thrive on neglect? As in low light, and watering 
only when wilty?<br>
I have no idea what sort of orchid this one is. <br>
<br>

Any advice is welcome! <br>

 they like a moist environment (NOT wet 
feet-)bright INDIRECT sunlight..Imagine them growing, hanging from trees in a 
dence forest..moist, bright filtered light.<br>
If that pot it is in has a 
plastic pot inside I would take off the outer pot. Orchid plants roots need to 
breathe. Special orchid clay pots have holes and slits all around the pot. The 
pretty outside pot looks good but does nothing to improve the health of your 
flower. I just love orchids! <br>

 I had a Peace Lily for years and neglect pretty 
well describes what it got. I'd find it wilted and draped over the pot, down to 
the floor. A good watering and it was perky within a couple of hours. I finally 
pushed it too far. It is no more. <br>

 Claude, I'll look for one of those 
orchid pots. This one is in a plastic pot inside the ceramic one. Moist is not 
a problem in our area this time of year! <br>
binnylou, That's a relief to 
hear. I've never been good with fussy houseplants but I'm excellent at neglect.
<br>These plants were given as memorials to my sister so I'm hoping to be able 
to keep them around.<br>
Thanks! <br>

 Your orchid is a 
Phaelanopsis(sp?) - aka &quot;Moth Orchid&quot;. They're lovely easy plants - a 
perfect beginner's orchid. I have had several for many years now, &amp; even 
when I've been neglectful they still continue to perform for me. Bright 
indirect light is best - mine are on an east-facing windowsill above the 
kitchen sink. As stated on other posts - well-draining orchid medium is best, 
which usually consists mostly of shredded bark. And as also stated, terracotta 
orchid pots with the little slits in the sides are best for good drainage &amp; 
aeration. Although I don't know how &quot;organic&quot; it is, I also use a 
fertilizer specifically meant for orchids. Most garden centers &amp;/or box 
stores carry it. Used as directed, &amp; clipping off the bloom stems once they 
wither, can have your orchid blooming almost continuously.<br>
<br>
The only 
pest I've ever had a problem with is Mealybug, which seems to arrive on every 
orchid I've purchased or received. A few applications of Safer insecticidal 
soap keeps things under control.<br>
<br>
As for the Peace Lily - bright 
indirect light works best. They burn easily in hot bright situations. Soil kept 
just moist works best; overwatering will yellow &amp; rot them. <br>

 I despise those pots that orchids are sold in! 
The best thing I've found so far for the pitiful ones rescued off the sales 
rack are decorative pots with lots of holes. Those made for potpouri or votive 
candles work great for small orchids (I managed to find several dirt cheap at a 
thrift shop).<br>
<br>
Like BG, a north window and moderately moist soil works 
for peace lilies and orchids--I have one large and 2 small phals that are 
plump-leaved and producing new roots and leaves, plus a variegated peace lily 
putting out new leaves. <br>

 North-facing exposures do NOT work for me, nor did I say they did. 
All of my orchids (Phals, mini-Cymbidiums, &amp; Occs) are in an EAST-facing 
window over my kitchen sink. I get good foliage growth &amp; extremely frequent 
blooms at this exposure. <br>

 Ooops, you're right---I 
meant window that got MORNING light. (I should not try to knit, watch TV, 
kibbitz with Da Hubby, and answer online posts at the same time! ) <br>

 Granny - I just noticed the pot your orchid is 
in &amp; realized that I have the exact same setup (plastic pot inside tall 
ceramic pot) in an orchid I received for Mother's Day. They're put out by a FL 
company called Kerry's. Here's a link to their website where they have lots of 
pics &amp; care tips:<br>

 Oops....don't have an east-facing window on the 
first floor and I know that if I put it upstairs it will die of neglect since I 
only go up there when we're expecting guests. However, my screened porch is 
east-facing and shaded so maybe I'll put them out there for the summer and 
figure out what to do with them in the fall.<br>
A friend stopped by today and 
told me she has orchids like mine and waters them by putting three ice cubes on 
the soil once a week. Sounds easy enough.<br>
Thanks all. <br>

If ice cubes once a week have been working for your friend over a long period 
of time, all the more power to her. But if I were you, I'd consider that these 
orchids are true tropicals, &amp; ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum. 
Plain old luke-warm water is still the best. <br>

 A 
window facing a partial sun might do.<br>
<br>
Do not over-fertilize this 
orchid.<br>
1/4 strength will do OK, <br>
in the growing season <br>
<br>
Use 
porous orchid mix;<br>
then you can water/fertilize <br>
with about 80 degree 
warm water,<br>
any time of the day, <br>
during the growing season. <br>
<br>

Wipe excess water, with a paper folded<br>
paper towel. <br>
<br>
This way you 
can water your plant,<br>
anytime of the day/night. <br>
<br>
Keep a pot of 
&quot;catnip&quot; nearby<br>
to deter your cats. <br>
<br>
Good growing, <br>

 Good tip about the catnip. My cat just loves to rub up 
against my orchid! <br>

 Orchids like humidity 
so if it's indoors, water and/or mist it frequently. I lost all my big orchid 
plants recently and am down to one phaelenopsis which has yet to bloom, but 
looks nice and healthy. I bring it in the shower with me at least once a week 
so it can get fully doused and enjoy the steam and humidity. <br>

<br>  Matt - that's far too much of a blanket generalization. Depending on the 
orchid type, high humidity isn't always necessary, &amp; more orchids die from 
overwatering than underwatering - particularly those with aerial root systems 
grown in a bark medium. <br>
