<p> <b>Code of the Road</b><br>
<br>
 On the road, live by the Golden Rule, and
<br> leave a place of stay a little better than found. </p> <i> Positive Karma, 
Chi, Joss, Spirit, Good-Will ... all have a habit of coming around again.</i> 
<h2><i>Keep On Cycling</i> - AKA Road Survival&nbsp; &nbsp; (Things to Know to 
Keep Moving): </h2> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Tire Shops are a biker's best friend</b> (<i>after Bicycle Shops</i>). 
They have tools, air, oil, grease, and water. Tire shops can be difficult to 
find outside of the US. In Europe they are not allowed to advertise or have a 
large entrance sign. See more details at the following link,Tires, Tools, 
Lubes, and other help ....</li> 
<li>In the field, any lubricant is better than no lubricant (Engine Oil, 
Transmission Fluid, Grease, and as a last resort: Food-Vegetable-Olive Oil). 
Ivan Viehoff (world expedition bike traveler - seeExtended Touring) states that 
he uses Hipoid [Hypoid] Gear Oil (that's 80-90 weight Rear Differential Oil). 
He states that it lasts longer and is cheaper than bike oils and any Auto 
Shop/Garage/Shade Tree location in the world will have a little to spare (even 
a little in a discarded can/bottle on the side of the road, will get a person a 
day or three of travel).</li> 
<li>Sun Screen works as an oil substitute in an emergency.</li> 
<li>We prefer oil (to include Teflon and/or Synthetic blends) over wax or 
grease types of lubrication, for long range touring, because oil is the least 
messy lubrication and presents the least management problems.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Oil is, just as effective as wax or grease and is a time saver, 
wipes/removes grime easiest with a clean rag, and is easiest to apply in 
temperatures below 60&deg;F (~15&deg;C).</li> 
<li>Wax and oils with wax coagulate around 60&deg;F and will not pour or 
penetrate where needed.</li> 
<li>80-90 Weight Oil works well in heat (90&deg;F/32&deg;C or greater) but 
remember that even in deserts, the summer nights and mornings are often in the 
40s-50s &deg;F (4-10&deg;C).</li> 
<li> The most convenient time for chain and drive-train maintenance is in the 
morning (before biking) or in the evening (after biking), however, Wax, Grease, 
and Heavy Oil usage often requires application when it is warmer outside 
(typically in mid-day).</li> </ul> 
<li>WD-40, Sewing Machine Oil, and 3n1 Oil all work in a pinch and we have 
used them all at some point, they just won't last very long as a lubricant (3-6 
hours of steady tour load riding) and if the excess oil is not wiped clean, 
these particular oils are noted for holding dirt on chains (slightly to a lot 
more so than 'bicycle chain oils').</li> 
<ul> 
<li>WD-40 [Water Displacement - Formula 40 (composed of mineral oil, mineral 
spirits, and gasoline according to their website) - invented to prevent rust 
and corrosion on Atlas Rockets] is aPenatrant, water displacer, and a light 
duty lubricant. The problem with Penatrants is that they dry out in a very 
short period of time and this is good. Penatrants are used to break the bond of 
dry, rusted, corroded, galvanized, and/or oxidized bolts and/or nuts. Avoid 
using WD-40 to lubricate chains except when there is no alternative or one is 
trying to work out some rust. If used, wait an hour or two, the penatrant will 
evaporate and then use appropriate oil or grease (lubricant).</li> 
<li>Mineral Oil is also a Penatrant. Sewing machine Oil and light weight oils 
will not last very long on a bicycle (2-6 hours).</li> 
<li>3-in-One Oil was invented as a Bicycle lubricant, rust preventative, and 
cleaner in 1894. It still works but one may not want or need the cleaning 
component (which is probably aPenatrant or Penatrant like compound).</li> 
<li> Do use 3-in-One Oil or WD-40 on a chain to clean rust or wipe off rust 
residue, especially on a bike that had to be put away wet, or on a bike that 
got wet, or on a bike that was left outdoors for some period of time (like most 
kid's bikes), or the bike is displaying rust on the chain. Work the chain in 
two or three cleaning application/wiping sessions or remove the chain and use a 
bottle with chain cleaner or a professional cleaning system (wheel brush and 
cage or basin).</li> 
<li>Penatrants take about 24 hours to evaporate (without external 
acceleration) and the presence of a penatrant can keep higher viscosity oil(s) 
from adhering to tight friction components (where lubrication is most needed).
</li> </ul> 
<li> For plastic Oil Bottles with plastic straw tube(s): Cut the plastic tube 
into 1.5 Inch segments (about 5 cm's) and tape the extra tube(s) to the bottle 
using duct tape [from Michael @ Criterium Bike Shop, Colorado Springs]. These 
plastic straws seem to be easily lost on tours.</li> 
<li>For long range touring, drop some solder into the cable about the area of 
the pinch bolt contact; Have a mechanic perform this task or do it yourself. It 
helps to prevent strand breaks and insures that the cable will last longer.</li>
<li>If one pulls a derailer cable wire by the 'end cap' (aka Crimp), one will 
likely pull off the end cap and the cyclist will not be able to remount the end 
cap and therefore will have loose strands at the cable's end, THUS making it 
more difficult to grasp the cable end for any derailer maintenance. One 
solution is to melt some solder into the cable wire's end. Another solution is 
to grasp the wire just before the end cap in order to perform any cable pulling 
for a derailer adjustment.</li> 
<li>If possible, as soon as one picks up a tuned bike from a shop (or you just 
tuned it perfectly OR as soon as it is opportune), mark the juncture of the 
derailer and frame (sometimes at two different places, using permanent marker 
[black or silver]) such that the stroke of the mark touches both the derailer 
and frame at the same time. Such an indicator is invaluable for re-aligning a 
derailer in case of damage, repair, removal, or replacement on the trail or at 
a foreign bike shop. See next Marking Bullet.</li> 
<li>One should mark the juncture of the seat post stem and the seat post tube 
such that the stroke of the mark touches both the stem and tube at the same 
time. Such an indicator is invaluable for re-posting or re-assembly of the 
bike's seat/saddle.</li> 
<li><b>Use a Black or Silver/Gray Marker to mark any component/object on a 
bicycle</b> (especially for marking seat posts and handlebar positions).<br>
<b>
Do NOT use a Scribe to mark anything</b> on a bike unless it is a mark for 
cutting or trimming a component. Scribes are metal pointed markers used for to 
mark material for cutting. The very scratch of a Scribe mark weakens the 
material/metal at that scratch mark; it is especially a 'No No' for seat posts!
</li> 
<li>If one is shipping and reassembling bikes (also see Bike Shipping for more 
shipping details), be sure to mark other key component meeting points (like the 
handlebar and stem). Marking determination depends on what components need to 
be removed for shipping and reassembly.</li> 
<li>There is nothing like having a bipod stand on a bike for a long tour to 
help one conduct shift tuning/adjustments in the field, a travel mate will 
appreciate it too.</li> 
<li>Tuck shoe string ends under the shoe string, especially on the crank rings 
side (or the shoe string may get caught between the chain and drive sprocket).
</li> 
<li>Heatshrink tubing works great as a shoe lace tip (Aglet) replacement 
(narrow tube heatshrink tubing is found in most electrical, auto parts, or 
hardware stores). Also, sometimes glue (super glue), a small strip of duct 
tape, resin/sap from a tree, or candle wax can be used. Sometimes nylon lace 
type tips can be melted and molded (CAUTION: Burning and/or dripping liquid 
nylon burns intense like miniature napalm and must NOT be handled by hand (use 
piece of wet paper/cardboard ); some repair suggestions from &quot;Ian's 
Shoelace Site&quot;).</li> 
<li>Extra large heatshrink tubing works as a rack hook cover for metal pannier 
hooks/bracket mounts(found in larger electrical outlet stores or in mega 
hardware stores) - Hint from Todd Shusterman (da Vinci Designs).</li> 
<li>Always know how to make a telephone call, by actual practice, back to the 
home country from another country and how to make a call in that country (or 
countries). If this requires a card code, code numbers, and/or correct coins 
then be suitably prepared. Practice in a place such that if something goes 
wrong or does not work correctly a person can remedy the situation. The act is 
a wise investment and the call will usually make someone's day.</li> 
<li>A traveler should always have small bills and coinage of the country (or 
countries) being visited. Most money changers will not issue small bills and 
rarely will they issue coins. Sometimes we buy a package of gum or some candy 
at the arrival port just to get small bills and pocket change. The small bills 
are for taxis, buses, tips and incidentals and the change is for toilet use or 
emergency phone calls.</li> 
<li>A pocket sized spiral notebook and pencil are priceless in countries where 
a traveler does not know the language. It works for drawing pertinent concepts 
or objects, maps, names and addresses, and for making travel notes or ideas. 
Water proof varieties can be found in better camping stores or online.</li> 
<li>In non USA towns, at hostels, pensions, residencias, hotels, and places of 
business, people who own tools, a rarity in itself, either lock them up or take 
their valuable possessions home with them at night, weekends, and holidays. 
When traveling, don't count on help during these time periods (siesta's too). 
Note that most travelers arrive and depart on weekends. Further note that other 
countries have different sets of holidays: SeeHolidays by Country.</li> 
<li>Before any trip, insure that the bicycles(s) are road ready the day before 
(or earlier). Many a time, we have found bikes with flat tires or missing/broke 
components. Its easy to fix or replace components before a trip but it robs 
everyone of precious time on the day of a trip.</li> 
<li>Bar-Ends help prevent damage to the shifters and the brakes. This applies 
to Integrated Brake-Shifter Systems too.Travel Scenario: A cyclist may be 
fifteen miles from a village, a hundred miles from a bike shop, the cell phone 
cannot connect to a working cell, and a brake won't work and/or the traveler 
can't shift (the bike is stuck in one sprocket ring, usually Low-Low for 
Mountain Bikes and/or High for Road Bikes) all because the bike unexpectedly 
fell over or blew over onto some rocks (and among other things, a simple bar 
end would have prevented any brake/shifter damage, perhaps even from a road 
crash).</li> 
<li>A strip of tire inner tube with self stick Velcro can be used to wrap 
around an Integrated Brake-Shifter System (to keep debris out).</li> 
<li>The large version of stretch plastic food bowl covers will work well as a 
rain cover for a bicycle seat - It seems to not matter how wet a bike is during 
a ride as long as the seat is dry. Sometimes, motel/hotel shower caps work well 
as a bicycle seat's impromptu rain cover. Little plastic trash bags work too.
</li> 
<li>A moisture wicking headband does a good job of keeping sweat out of the 
eyes. Sunscreen on the forehead will almost always end up in the eyes. If a 
helmet and sweatband are worn, then the sunlight is likely to be blocked from 
the forehead (thus eliminating the need for sunscreen on the forehead).</li> 
<li>A helmet mounted shade bill can block out the sun or sun glare - very nice 
for long rides or tours.</li> 
<li> A helmet rain cover can keep the head dry and warm - there are cold 
weather and warm weather rain covers. Some helmet covers are waterproof, some 
water repellent, some are for shading the sun, some are very bright and are 
safety oriented, and some are just for decoration.</li> 
<li>Sometimes the daily weather cycle is such that it rains every evening or 
every night. Learn to dry wet gear, clothing, and/or equipment with the mid day 
or mid morning sun (whenever it appears for the warmest longest time). 
Sometimes this drying time can be shared with lunch or a well timed break for 
another purpose. This dry or less humid time period may be the right 
opportunity to patch an inner tube (removed during a super wet rain storm) and 
it may be the right time to perform any maintenance.</li> 
<li>Channel Lock Pliers are far more utilizable than regular pliers. A good 
pair of Channel Locks can perform most wrench functions and they have wider 
fitting capability than a six inch adjustable wrench or a regular six inch 
pliers. [suggestion from John Schubert's book,<i>The Tandem Scoop</i>, Burley 
Design Cooperative, 1993.])</li> 
<li>Use Thread Lock for Tours. Don't confuse permanent with temporary Thread 
Lock.Learn More [Hint from Adventure Cycling and John Burnett's Manual (of 
Bicycle Repair)].</li> 
<li>Reflective Cloth Strips can be purchased at better Cloth Stores or the 
Internet. While some Reflective strips can be glued, by hot ironing, the more 
lasting reflective strips are sewn. [Also known as &quot;Do the job right the 
first time&quot;.]</li> 
<li>Note that security is always an issue. Pretty things attract people 
(especially kids) and ugly things repel people. There are decals for sell on 
the Internet that make bikes look old, dented, dirty, scratched, and 
un-desirable. Some people put on address labels and then strip them off, 
leaving that ugly white gummy look of an old sticker (rub some dirt on it to 
make it non-sticky and more ugly). See next bullet.</li> 
<li> Some cyclists put short wraps of duct tape around tubes (like the stays 
or seat mast) to have available for emergency use, but it also can serve to 
ugly up a bike. See next and previous bullet.</li> 
<li>Story: We read an article about the Perimeter Lady (she rides around 
things like parks, lakes, cities, countries). She reported that, in a foreign 
country, she was surrounded by many kids that expressed an interest in her 
bike. Clearly she did not know their intention. She happened to have some duct 
tape wrapped on her bike. She indicated to the kids that it was a good bike but 
that it needed some repairs. Their interest visibly waned and nothing happened. 
See previous bullet.</li> 
<li>Handlebar bags that detach and have a shoulder strap are great for 
carrying valuables that a cyclist always wants on person (passport, 
wallet/ID/credit cards/Drivers License, checkbook, itinerary, cell phone and 
important numbers list). In lieu of a handlebar bag, then having these items in 
one location like a dry sack is often convenient for situations where a 
traveler may have to be separated from the bike for a while (museums, historic 
places, theaters, restaurants, caf&eacute;s, hotels, toilets/water closets, 
ferries/boats, and trains). In a crunch, sleeping-bag covers or similar such 
sacks work as a carry-bag substitute.</li> 
<li>For foreign travel, based on attending a conference (or other business-tax 
deductible purpose), we are starting to bike before the conference rather than 
after. The reasoning is based on &quot;Jet Lag.&quot; While we can more easily 
overcome Jet Lag with bicycling work, we cannot overcome Jet Lag while sitting 
in an air conditioned room while sitting in a comfortable chair, where the 
lights are turned down for a projector presentation. We have evolved to taking 
the bike tour first, then attend the conference and we attend serious heavy 
weight conferences.</li> 
<li>When riding on dirt road trails, especially double track jeep trails, 
because soft dirt and sand tends to drift to the lower of the two tracks, 
switching lanes to the upper track (track of the higher elevation) will usually 
result in a more efficient ride (less pedal effort to maintain speed).</li> 
<li>When riding on dirt road trails, especially solid dirt road curves, 
usually the inside of the curve is soft dirt and/or washboard, neither of which 
is pleasant to ride upon and usually the outside of the curve is hard and 
smooth. Beware of oncoming traffic.</li> </ul><br>
<br>

the noblest invention of mankind.&quot;<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Tire Shops are a biker's best friend!</b> They have tools, air, oil, 
grease, and water. In remote towns and villages Tire Shops are often garages 
located at the back of a home and they are often not allowed to advertise. 
Learn to look for these places as one travels. There may only be a tiny one 
square foot sign of a tire in the front yard. We have yet to be charged for 
help while touring on bikes (a Code of the Road thing). We are seriously 
gracious, thankful, and we take pictures with the owner(s) and helper(s).</li>

<h3>Overview</h3>  This is a multi-part section that addresses Bicycle 
Maintenance fromthree perspectives. 
<ul> <b>One</b>, the more that one knows about bicycle maintenance, systems, 
processes and mechanics, the easier it is to identify and resolve bicycle 
touring mechanical issues while cycling on the road or trail. Therefore, in 
some cases, one is directed to online tutorials (as well as schools for the 
hardcore).<br>
<br>
<b>Two</b>, Preventive Maintenance, now, heads off problems 
down the road. Active ongoing maintenance is always better than more time spent 
on reactive maintenance.<br>
<br>
<b>Three</b>, sometimes one just has to deal 
with surprises. Some known and common problems are discussed herein and 
solutions are addressed.</ul>

 Assembly/Disassembly: Overview, 
Issues, and More Details, Tools <br>
<br>

<h4>Assembly Work Area (for a packed or shipped touring bicycle):</h4> 
<ol>  1) <b>The best option</b> for assembling factory shipped or personal 
transported bicycle is to<b>use a mechanic's work stand</b>. <br>
 2) The <b>
second best method</b> is to use a <b>simple build or assembly jig</b> that 
holds a frame off of the ground while allowing access to both sides of the bike 
(or built in such a manner that one end of the frame can be easily switched to 
the other end, for further access work).<br>
 3) The <b>third best build method
</b> is to work on top of a plastic sheet, space blanket, ground cloth, or 
empty cardboard box (like a bike manufacturer's shipping box), thus keeping the 
bike on its side until the wheels are mounted (or in process of being mounted).
<br> 3.5) If the cyclist has a <b>Bipod Kick Stand</b>, as soon as the frame 
can be set up without damaging the cable retainers/holders at the bottom of the 
frame, set the bike upright. This is often done as soon as the front wheel can 
be mounted with a rear mounted bipod kick stand (on rare occasion it is the 
opposite, a front bipod and rear wheel mounted).Another huge advantage of 
having a bipod kickstand is being able to park the bike wherever the cyclist 
wants; it frees the cyclist from having to park with other bikes without 
kickstands that are either leaning against a structure or building and it frees 
the cyclist from having to lay the bike on its side (which takes up a lot of 
space, especially if there are 20+ bikes in the same area). <br>
<br>
<b>
Caution: AVOID putting the bottom of the frame on the ground</b> (floor, deck, 
...). The way to get into such a bad situation is to place frame upright 
against a wall, bench, or furniture in order to work on the bike (assembly or 
repair) while the bottom of the frame is on the ground (floor, deck, ...).<b>
The issue is that the cable retainers/channels will likely be damaged 
(squished, collapsed, or miss-shaped).</b> How to Fix Damaged Cable Retainers. 
<br> <br>
<b>Hint: A bicycle bipod facilitates a better assembly work area</b> 
and for long term remote bicycle tours, no other single thing makes trail side 
maintenance easier than having a bipod; a bipod kick stand helps tremendously 
with derailer adjustments or repairs as well as helping with rear tire repairs 
(80-90% of all flats are on the rear tire).</ol>

<h4>Bicycle Shipping/Assembly Chain Issues </h4> 
<ol> 
<li>One issue is the chain itself. <b>Experience: It is usually better to ship 
the bike with the chain removed than mounted and taped to the frame in a bag.
</b> Some really small bikes allow the chain to remain on the bike - there is 
nothing wrong with that unless the chain scratches the frame or comes loose 
from the tape job. If one removes the chain from the bike for shipping 
purposes, then<b>the SRAM and SRAM Quick Link System is better/safer than the 
Shimano Pin Pop System</b>. SRAM states that the Quick Link, for liability 
purposes, is a onetime use component. But most people get about five safe 
linkups. The other side of that issue is that a worn Quick Link will come apart 
during use - almost always while climbing a hill with a load. SRAM says that it 
is worn after one use. The Quick Link also facilitates easier chain cleaning 
while touring (long tours).<b>Always have spare Quick Links and spare Chain 
Links.<i>In fact, on tours, it is best to also have a spare chain</i></b>.</li> 
<br> <br>

<li><b>Helpful Hint</b>: When connecting a chain, it is far easier to run it 
through the cage on the smallest rings (front and rear). This is a classic 
cross-chain situation to avoid when riding, but it makes mechanical assembly 
work easier for the bike builder.(Note that a 'good touring bike' will allow 
cross chaining, it is a performance efficiency issue). Remember to Test Spin 
the Pedals while Shifting; Look for smooth shifting and no chain 
grinding/noises.</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>It is easy to miss-thread a chain through most Rear Derailers</b>: 
<ol> <b>Hardware Note: The best derailer swing arm (basket) design for quick 
touring assembly is the 'Open Cage' design type</b>  that allows the cyclist to 
place the chain in between the Jockey Wheels (aka Derailer Pulleys) without 
having to thread the chain through a cage opening/end nor have to weave the 
chain around the Jockey Wheels (Pulleys) - A cyclist mounts the chain by 
rotating the derailer's cage 90&deg;, laying the chain across the opening, and 
then releases the basket; the swing arm then snaps the tension out of the chain 
and it is ready to go [one should conduct a pedal spin to synchronize the cage 
position with the derailer's hand setting]. Shimano makes such a cage and some 
Bike Friday tour bikes have (or used to have) this feature. </ol>  In lieu of 
an open faced derailer swing/tension arm/cage, then the cyclist must thread the 
chain through the openings for the Jockey Wheels. It is easy to thread a chain 
in the wrong direction around jockey wheels. It is easy to thread a chain on 
the wrong side of a Tension Arm brace in the middle of a Tension Arm (thus 
grinding the chain on the cross bar, brace, or guard). One way to avoid 
miss-threading a Tension Arm is to<b>pre-mark the exact chain-run on the 
Tension Arm (See the Picture).</b> About Jockey Wheels / Derailer Pullies. </li>
<br> <br>

<li><br>
4.&nbsp; Most Rear Derailers use a <b>Body Adjustment Screw (usually 
called a 'B Screw'</b> [with no explanation]). <b>Its PURPOSE</b> is to 'set' 
the distance between 'Guide Pulley' and the closest Rear Sprocket/Cog - 
typically, it should be 2-3 mm apart at its closest gear setting (test on each 
rear-sprocket/chain combination) and it hardly ever needs adjusting once it is 
set. There are a few gap distance exceptions and if the pulley is ever 
grinding/rubbing on any sprocket/cog/cassette/gear, then widen the distance.<b>
<br>A PROBLEM</b> is that if the derailer is removed and remounted (like for 
shipping), depending on the type of derailer, it is possible to mistakenly 
re-mount the rear derailer in such a way as to move the derailer's B-Screw's 
Stop Plate (which may be on the Derailer and Not on the Frame [the real problem 
- an inherent design issue]).<b>BEWARE:</b> By NOT mounting the Stop Plate for 
the B-Screw correctly, the bicycle assembly person may accidently cause the 
Rear Sprocket/Cassette to rub against the 'Guide Pulley' (aka Pilot Jockey Wheel
). More aboutJockey Wheels / Derailer Pullies.<br>
<br>
<b>PERFORMANCE:</b> 
With all other things being equal, the closer the Pilot Jockey is to the rear 
sprockets/cogs, the snappier the shifting performance - Yes, it can be set too 
close (a person can tell by the grinding noise in at least one of the gear 
settings, but usually in can be heard in all of them).<br>
<br>
 This is a 
non-issue if the Bike's Frame has the Stop Plate (versus the Stop Plate being 
on the Rear Derailer).<br>
<br>
<b>IF</b> the rear derailer has the B-Screw 
Stop Plate mounted to the rear derailer (versus the bike frame having the Stop 
Plate)<b>THEN</b> the bicycle assembly person has to re-set the Stop Plate in 
the correct position,<b>UNFORTUNEATELY</b> there are usually a couple different 
Stop Plate mounting position choices (it is often NOT 'Idiot proof' [from 
experience]).
<ul> 
<li><b>Long Term SOLUTION:</b> It really helps to have the matching mounting 
point pre-marked with a marking pen to line up the rear derailer's B-Screw Stop 
Plate appropriately on the Bike's Frame. Otherwise, the cyclist needs to figure 
it out.</li> 
<li><b>Short Term SOLUTION (and Helpful Hint):</b> When a person mounts the 
rear derailer, the B-Stop Screw needs to be against the Derailer's Stop (<i>
rotate the Derailer before applying the final torque such that the Derailer's 
Stop is butted against the end/tip of the B-Screw (take out the slack or 
shifting will be problematic</i>).</li> </ul> </li> </ol><br>

<h4>Brake and Shifter Cable Runs(s): </h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Perform a quick visual check of the chain run, especially if one has just 
transported the bike, performed shipping disassembly/reassembly work, added a 
new bike component, or the bike has crashed or fallen recently.</li> 
<li>DaVinci (the tandem bike company) sells, to the public, a brake and/or 
shifter cable connector (they are different sizes) that can be conveniently 
positioned at any interim position. The purpose of a connector it to eliminate 
having to reconnect a cable at a brake head or a derailer head (pinch bolt) 
thus eliminating a need to readjust a derailer or brake.</li> 
<li>If a derailer or brake cable seems loose or tight, recheck the cable run, 
usually a ferrule either did not seat all the way into its position or the 
ferrule is completely out of the cable retainer.</li> 
<li>We have seen a new and/or re-mounted bottle cage get in the way of the 
chain run, the bottles themselves, pannier mount and rack pieces, and a tire 
pump get in the way of a clean chain run or block derailer movement.</li> 
<li>On bikes with multiple bottle cages, sometimes it is wise to mark a mount 
position on the cages (as some may be purposefully bent left or right to avoid 
a crank or chain and re-mounting them in the wrong position after a shipping 
re-assembly can mal effect the drive train system).</li> 
<li>In the field, If their is no kickstand, ALWAYS lay the bike on its 
non-derailer side (left side usually); it is a good habit, even if the bike has 
pannier protection. BTW, leaning a bike in a public access way or area or 
against a window or door is considered rude behavior in most of the world (
Always set a good example).</li> </ul> 
<h4>About Damaged Cable Retainer(s)  and How to Fix Damaged Cable Retainer(s):
</h4> Top Mechanical Issues Directory Feedback 
<ol> <b>Field Repair:</b> If the retainer flange (wing, furl) is still there, 
use any combination of a<b>small flat tipped screwdriver</b>, <b>small pliers
</b> (narrow or needle nose are better), and/or a <b>small hex key</b> or nail. 
The plan is to use these tools to reshape the flange(s) so that it (they) can 
be used to hold the cable again. The work does not have to be pretty, but it 
needs to restore the retainer's function. Wrap or re-shape the flange around 
the hex key.<br>
<br>
<b>Field Emergency Replacement:</b> If a walk out is not 
practical and the Cable Retainer has been broke to the point that it is missing 
or is unusable then the rider needs to get real creative for a functional 
solution.<b>Note</b> that sometimes, two cables can be shared in one remaining 
cable retainer (the cable's length will have to be adjusted at the pinch bolt 
and sometimes all of the slack needs to be removed at a barrel adjustor).<b>Note
</b> that sometimes the cable may be temporarily laid between two cable 
retainers - It will rub the paint and will eventually wear into the frame but 
it will allow the cyclist to get out of a remotes area. Otherwise, the two best 
tools for emergency construction are<b>Super Glue</b> (permanent glue) and/or 
<b>Duct Tape</b>. Some ideas follow: if a plastic protection tube is on the 
cable, slide the tube to the corner/bend and tape it down; bend a penny, dime, 
washer or other coin (with pliers) and put that into place (tape and/or glue). 
Or consider using a small block of wood (just about matchbook size) with a 
grove. Or, glue two nuts to the frame and let the cable run in between. Or, 
split any kind of hollow tube (like a pen or small metal pipe for an emergency 
tent pole, or pipe like thing) just big enough to put the cable inside and 
fasten that down. Take a round metal cylinder and flatten it and then fold the 
sides like a taco. Take a very small flat metal bar and fold it into a spiral 
or twist around the cable's space (treading or twisting the cable into the 
inside space). A coat hanger, shape twisted tightly around a nail will work (by 
tight, we mean many wraps close together like a spiral back notebook). Metal 
will last longer but anything that works to get a rider out of a remote jam is 
better than nothing to include folded paper wrapped around the cable and taped 
down.<br>
<b>Hint 1:</b> Fit the cable into the new retainer before fastening 
the retainer (as the process of attaching the makeshift retainer may block the 
ability to easily re-thread the cable through or into the replacement retainer).
<br> <b>Hint 2:</b> Very often, the brake or shifter cable will need to be 
re-adjusted for the length of the new run and if it is a shifter cable then a 
derailer adjustment will likely be in order. SeeFront Derailer Adjustment or 
Rear Derailer Adjustment. <br>
<br>
<b>Bike Shop or Home Shop Repair:</b> Mount 
the bike on a stand such that it will be easy to work on the cable retainer - 
usually the best working height is between the waist and chest heights. A 
center punch (from a set of different sized punches) will facilitate a nearly 
perfect cylindrical shape. A small flat tip screw driver may be needed to open 
the flange or at least open the flange enough to guide in the center punch. If 
the flange is too open use a small plastic hammer to guide the flange into 
place. Leave just enough space to allow the cable to fit between the flange 
edges. If the end opening is just a little bigger than the center slot's gap 
that is usually OK.<br>
<br>
<b>Bike Shop Cable Retainer Replacement:</b> 
Usually the bike shop can either re-braze a braze on cable mount but that 
action will destroy the paint finish (it will burn from torch use). In some 
cases it may be spot welded (low probability). In some cases a cheaper stick-on 
(glue-on) plastic mount can be applied but this too requires a smooth clean 
surface and the bike will probably need to be power sanded or maybe even power 
grinded. Any of these actions will require paint touch-up or finishing (which 
is the most costly aspect of all the repair work and it is purely cosmetic).<br>
</ol> 
<h4>Shipping Issues: </h4> 
<ol> The following is a very light discussion about Shipping Issues - There is 
a very heavy and detailed discussion of most known issues and experiences at the
Bicycle Tranport and Shipping Webpage (within this web site). <br>
<br>
<b>
Generally it costs less to carry a packed bike on an airplane</b> (even with 
the newer bag costs and weight limits and charges) than it costs to ship the 
bike. But, for some people in some situations where time is more of a factor 
than money, then it is<b>not unusual to air/ground freight a bike to a 
destination bike shop</b> and have the bike shop assemble and test ride the 
bike. Usually, in 2012 USD's, this assembly service ranges in the 20-25 USD 
cost range. A cyclist can ship directly to a Hotel or B&amp;B but they usually 
do NOT like the added liability nor do they like the storage responsibilities 
(they too have valuable space problems) - Always get approval beforehand.<br>

<br> Always make a point, at first contact with a manager of a Destination Bike 
Shop, to<b>let the Manager/Owner/Supervisor know that you wish to re-use the 
shipping box</b> at the bike tour's conclusion. There are many stories of 
workers in a bike shop disposing one's shipping containers (because that is 
what they do with their factory shipments and shop storage space is valuable).

<h2>Derailer, Shifting, and Shifter - Touring Issues:</h2> Top Mechanical 
Issues Directory<br>
<br>
<b>No bike performance issue is more frustrating</b> 
than not being able to get a fully loaded bicycle into low gear for a big hill 
climb where the hill is right there in front of the cyclist and the cyclist 
knows to get into low gear and the<i>sticking</i> derailer will NOT force the 
chain onto the correct/desired crank ring. It is even more frustrating when the 
hand shifter's index is indicating that a shift took place when the derailer, 
in fact, did not make the ring change.By-the-Way, if this actually happens, and 
the problem is the front derailer not railing onto the low gear ring then try 
down shifting the rear derailer; very often the movement will help nudge 
(re-align the chain-line) the chain onto the little front/granny ring.<br>
<br>

<b><i>Arrg, </i>Maintenance Time on the trail side!</b><br>

<ul> 
<li>REMINDER HINT: Plan your gear selection before it is needed, especially 
for down shifting. It is naturally difficult for any quality drive system to 
down shift into the lowest gear settings when one is already pedaling up a 
slope. It is difficult to give the shift action a little pause in order to take 
the pressure off of the derailer and chain, in fact the very act of providing a 
shifting pause will probably bring the bike to a halt.</li> 
<li>FACTS:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>The term Gear and Low Gear comes from cars and driving vehicles.</li> 
<li>Most bicycles use sprocket rings and chains.</li> 
<li>Some bicycles use a drive shaft; some use a drive belt with teeth.</li> 
<li>Sprockets are driven by a Chain (from a Power Crank), Gears are driven by 
Gears (from a Power Crank).Remember: Car engine pistons are connected to a 
Crank Shaft.</li> 
<li>Like cars, the low gear is the setting that offers the most torque and the 
least speed (compared to other settings).</li> 
<li>The low gear on the front crank is the smallest crank ring/sprocket.</li> 
<li>The low gear on the rear end is the largest ring/sprocket.</li> 
<li>If a bike has more than two rings on the front crank, the smallest ring is 
called a Granny Gear, usually this is a third ring but there can be more rings 
on the front (like on some Tandem Bikes).</li> 
<li>Many mechanics tend to clarify these points so as to avoid term usage 
differences or misunderstandings.</li> 
<li>The <b>'H'</b> stamp on a Derailer means <b>'High Gear Adjustment Screw'
</b> (Which is the Big Ring on the Front Crank or the Smallest Cog on the Rear 
Drive).<br>
 The <b>'L'</b> stamp on a Derailer means <b>'Low Gear Adjustment 
Screw'</b> (Which is the Smallest Ring on the Front Crank or the Biggest Cog on 
the Rear Drive).<br>
 Sometimes the Derailers are not labeled and one just has 
to figure it out. On my own bikes, I will scratch/scribe in a Letter.</li> </ul>
 CONCEPT: Be sure to review theDerailer Concept Picture (worth a thousand 
words) about how the adjustment Stop Screws function, their purpose is 
explained conceptually in this text image. The image also lists the part names 
for the derailer.</ul> 
<h3>Derailer Adjustment Order (Shop or Field, Front before Rear):</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>If Both Derailers need adjusting, Then ALWAYS Perform the Front 
Derailer Adjustment FIRST.</b> Of the two adjustment choices, High or Low, 
always adjust the default/start/at-rest position FIRST. 99% of all front 
derailers default to the Low (L) Position when disconnected from the cable.</li>
<li><b>If the front derailer does not need adjusting, then only adjust the 
rear derailer.</b> On occasion, an adjustment to the rear derailer may require 
a fine re-adjustment on the front derailer to insure proper line-up of H/H or 
L/L combinations.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Front Derailer Adjustment, First Check: </h3> Top &nbsp; Mechanical Issues 
Directory &nbsp; Rear Derailer Adjustment<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>In the Field, Check First:</b> If the bicycle has been shifting nicely 
for a couple days of travel and it is just beginning to have difficulty 
shifting into the smallest ring, then turn the shift adjuster barrel on the 
handlebar shifter,outward from the brake lever housing, 1/8 of a turn at a time 
(this can be done while riding for experienced rides, one may need to unlock 
the flat-ribbed lock-nut first. Typically, there is no rear barrel adjustor on 
a front derailer on and at the Front Derailer but there is often a barrel 
adjustor on the handlebar end.<br>
<br>
 There are a few issues to regard at 
the same time:
<ol> 
<li><b>Warning,</b> don't confuse the brake barrel adjuster with the shifter 
adjustor.<br>
[It seems that everyone moves the wrong barrel adjuster at least 
once in their life.]</li> 
<li>Moving the barrel outward, away from the brake lever, takes slack out of 
the cable.<br>
[Moving the barrel inward puts slack into the shifter cable and 
generally moving the barrel inward will make the shifting situation more 
difficult.<br>
 Moving the barrel too far outward may make a shift skip a ring 
or set the chain to rub or grind on the cage.]</li> 
<li>Count and memorize how many rotation turns were performed, then if things 
get worse, one can restore the configuration back to the start point.<br>
Also, 
consider that maybe something else is out-of-place, like a bent ferrule house 
along the cable run or that a ferrule is partially out of its house, check the 
entire cable run (particularly when trail riding or if a bike fall has 
occurred).</li> 
<li>Ride for a while, if the situation has improved, maybe no more adjusting 
is needed, but if the situation is improving, then maybe another outward 1/8 
turn adjustment is needed.<br>
Continue turn out trials in steps until optimum 
result.</li> 
<li>Rarely is more than a full turn needed. In fact, It seems that 2 or 3 (1/8 
or 1 click) turns usually does the trick.</li> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Remember</b>, 
after adjusting and testing the gear limits,<b>re-set the gear settings to an 
easy start position.</b></i> </ol></li> </ul> <b>Derailer adjustment steps 
follow</b>,  below this Derailer Concepts Graphic.<br>
<br>

<h3>Front Derailer Adjustment, Next Do:</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Understand the Derailer Adjustment Concept from the previous picture (just 
above).</li> 
<li>Perform a quick visual check of the chain run, especially if one has just 
transported the bike, performed shipping disassembly/reassembly work, added a 
new bike component, or the bike has crashed or fallen recently.We have seen a 
new and/or re-mounted bottle cage get in the way of the chain run, the bottles 
themselves, pannier mount and rack pieces, and a tire pump get in the way of a 
clean chain run or block derailer movement. On bikes with multiple bottle 
cages, sometimes it is wise to mark a mount position on the cages (as some may 
be purposefully bent left or right to avoid a crank or chain and re-mounting 
them in the wrong position after a shipping re-assembly can mal effect the 
drive train system). See adjacent picture.</li> 
<li>Put the bike on a work stand, kick stand (bipod, triangle), find a way to 
get the rear wheel off the ground, and/or get a buddy to help hold up the rear 
end of the bike or in a worst case scenario lay the bike on its non-derailer 
side (left side usually).</li> 
<li>The chain must run through the cage and be on the Low Gear (smallest front 
ring) for the L Screw adjustments and the chain must be on the High Gear 
(biggest front ring) for H screw adjustments.</li> 
<li>Set or Re-Set the Derailer Hand Controls.</li> 
<li><b>Start at the L or H screw that represents the At-Rest-Position:</b> The 
At-Rest-Position is where the derailer cage goes when it is un-connected to the 
shifter cable. Typically, the At-Rest-Position is the LOW (L) gear (chain and 
cage over the smallest ring) position or else apply the following logic to the 
High (H) Position (chain and cage over the biggest ring). Almost all Front 
Derailers default to the Low position when not connected to the shift cable 
(but there are exceptions and it has to do with the design of the four-bar 
parallelogram that holds the chain rail cage).A way to validate the 
at-rest-position (without undoing the cable) is to place the shifter in either 
extreme gear setting (chain and derailer cage on largest or smallest ring) and 
physically pull in the middle of the cable (at the down tube or bottom tube for 
tandems +), if the cable pull moves the cage over another gear, then it started 
at the at-rest-position.</li> 
<li><b>Sometimes the L and H screws are not labeled</b>. One must figure out 
which screw is which, in a majority of instances the L screw is to the outside 
on a front derailer and the inside on a rear derailer but this is NOT written 
in stone (it can be the other way around and it can be mixed - the safest 
analysis method is to actually look for the Stops and reverse think the 
mechanical functionality). Also, if you have the cage in the proper position 
(most inward or outward ring) and the chain is resting on said ring, if one 
makes a screw setting adjustment and the cage does not move (sometimes it takes 
a little effort to screw inward, but screwing outward 1/8 of a turn should have 
an immediate visual micro movement of the cage), then one is on the incorrect 
Stop Screw. If one was rotating the incorrect derailer adjustment screw, be 
sure to place it in its original position and then move to the other Screw (and 
insure that the cage and chain are positioned correctly).</li> 
<li><b>Sometimes the derailer cage can be the source of a shifting or noise 
problem</b> and not necessarily the shifter or its four-bar parallelogram 
component. Insure that the cage is Square and Not Damaged, Bent, or Mangled. If 
the cage is damaged or misshaped and one can get the bike to a bike shop, then 
do so. However, if one is on tour (in the field), then the cyclist will need to 
reshape the cage as best one can - this step can entail more art than science. 
Also check to see if the cage is hitting a sprocket/gear (there should be 1-2 
mm clearance from the closest cage-sprocket shifter setting). Cage design is<i>
ubber</i> complex and sophisticated; the cage nose, middle, and tail may each 
have different chain railing/derailing concave/flat/curved shapes for chain 
shift management as well as high and low cage shape functions and every now and 
then a cage tail may be designed to curve away from the nose. It's not secret 
science but manufacturers don't reveal much in this topic area - Mechanics 
learn it or figure it over time. Inspect the cage and fix if needed. Sometimes, 
one must ride out with a limited gear selection. SeeReshaping the Cage.</li> 
</ol> 
<ul> 
<h3>Actual Front Derailer Adjustments:</h3> <b>Some Quick Explanations:</b> 
<ol> 
<li>On the Front Derailer, 'L' Screw means Low [Gear] (and 'H' Screw means 
High [Gear]).</li> 
<li>On the Front Rings, Low pertains to the Smallest Front Ring and High 
pertains to the Biggest Front Ring.</li> 
<li>On the Rear Derailer, for the Rear Sprockets (Cassette or Cogs), it is 
just the opposite, 'L' means Low but Low pertains to the Biggest Rear Sprocket 
and High (H) pertains to the Smallest Rear Sprocket.</li> 
<li>'B' Screw means Body Adjustment Screw (it is used to adjust the Rear 
Derailer's Swing Arm 'At Rest' position - rarely needed).Read More Detail</li>. 
</ol> <br>

<li><b>Most often,</b> the 'L' Screw needs to be adjusted Inboard using the 
ideas presented in theDerailer Operation Concept's Graphic/Image, such that the 
cage moves in a direction to positively place the chain onto the Low Gear 
(smallest front ring) without pushing the chain over/off the ring and without 
chain rub noise.
<ol> <b>Note: </b>Shifter cables take much more linear force than brake cables 
(to me, this is counter intuitive but it is the reason why shifter and brake 
cables are designed different from one another and they are generally NOT 
interchangeable). Riders often slam a shifter into a gear setting, especially 
the highest and lowest gear positions and may apply much more force than tested 
on a mechanic's stand. One such indicator is when a rider frequently shifts a 
chain over the smallest or largest rings (it is time to adjust the appropriate 
H or L Stop screw a little [1/8 turn at a time] to reduce the cage's reach). 
</ol> </li> 
<ul> 
<li>Then check the adjustment for the 'H' Screw - test by placing the chain 
into high gear (largest front ring). If necessary, make adjustments and insure 
that the chain goes onto the ring without overshooting the ring, nor 
undershooting the ring (chain noise).</li> 
<li>Always adjust the default at-rest-position's screw first; usually this is 
the L Screw before an H Screw.</li> 
<li>Enter an iteration cycle of adjusting and micro adjusting and spin the 
pedals while test shifting as needed (screw in or out in 1/8 turn increments). 
Set/Re-set the H Limit and set the L Limit, looking for the chain to rail onto 
the ring, not go over, and not rub an adjacent ring and not rub the cage. Be 
sure to check the rear derailers function also, test every sprocket combination 
- it doesn't take long. If the cage were damaged, one may need to slightly 
bend/re-shape the cage (SeeReshaping a Damaged Cage).</li> 
<li>Always test spin the pedals after an adjustment and run the shifter(s) 
through all gears (sprockets/cogs, rings) and always take a test ride before 
putting the tools away.An Aside: Because most bikes don't have stands, this can 
be interesting in the field, especially when your helper weighs 110 pounds and 
is lifting the rear end of the bike and the tour load is at about 50 pounds 
(just over the rear wheel) - Always be nice to your travel partner - The bipod 
styled kick stand can help a lot in this situation.</li> 
<li><b>Note</b>, in case you did everything perfectly and there is still chain 
noise, there are other things that can causeChain Noise worth knowing and 
resolving (like putting a new chain on a worn sprocket)</li> </ul> 
<h3>Problems and Solutions for Adjusting the Front Derailer:</h3> 
<li><b>Less often,</b> the 'L' Screw or Cage is at the physical limit and will 
Not move the cage and/or chain sufficiently (or at all) to place the chain on 
the Low chain ring, OR the derailer cage will not place the chain on the High 
('H') chain ring. If such is true, then one or more of the following solutions 
need to be implemented.</li> 
<ol> 
<li><b>The Shifter Cable may need to be Reset</b> (typically, the slack or 
space comes out of the cable run, as tension over time, whereas actual cable 
stretch is uncommon).</li> 
<li><b>The Front Derailer Mount Position may need Adjustment</b> (usually only 
a little). This in turn may affect the Cable/Derailer Attachment (a little too 
loose, a little too tight, back to item #1).</li> 
<li><b>The Cage may need to be Reshaped.</b> Any cage reshaping will always 
effect derailer performance and will usually result in a derailer chain/ring 
alignment re-adjustment.</li> </ol> <br>
<b>1) Addressing the Cable to the 
Front Derailer Adjustment Issue: </b> <br>
<b>First (before loosening the pinch 
bolt):</b> Quickly check for any of these other conditions. 
<ol> 
<li>Inspect the course of the chain and insure that nothing is impeding the 
chain or derailer (we had a water bottle in a cage, at one time, that was 
preventing the chain from railing onto the granny ring!).</li> 
<li>Insure that the derailer is mounted properly and securely (sometimes 
sticks get turned up and rotate the entire assembly).</li> 
<li>Insure that the cage is Square and Not Damaged, Bent, or Mangled (
especially after a crash).</li> 
<li>Validate that the front derailer system operates in-line with the rear 
derailer and cassette (check chain line and cages not bent or mangled).</li> 
<li>Insure that there is no shifter cable slack and IF the pinch bolt is going 
to be reset, THEN reset the barrel adjustor out two turns from full in (IF a 
barrel adjustor exists AND they can be on each end of the cable).</li> 
<li>Double check the shift-cable's run for condition and any obstructions<br>
 
(I have found cables that slipped out of their ferrules and cables that slipped 
out of their braze-on holders).</li> 
<li>Make sure that the shifter is, in fact, set to the At-Rest gear position 
(usually L [or 1], sometimes H [at max of 2 or 3 or 4 front rings]).<br>
 
[Caution: This Step often forgotten.]</li> 
<li>Reset, as is appropriate, the 'L' Screw and/or H screw so that a cyclist 
will have a full adjustment run for the next adjustment session.<br>
 [Caution: 
This Step often forgotten.]</li> <br>
</ol> <b>THEN, ONLY IF STILL NEEDED</b> ( 
i.e. the derailer is out of range of the sprockets) <br>
<i>&nbsp; First, have 
checked all items listed just previous.</i> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Reset the cable's attachment to the derailer's pinch bolt</b> on the 
cable attachment arm. Disconnect the cable (loosen the nut the minimum amount 
to free the cable tension) and as soon as the cable is free/disconnected, reset 
the hand shifter's adjustment barrel and locknut to 1 or 2 turns out from the 
inside stop.If there is a barrel adjustor on the front derailer (extremely 
rare) adjust it to one full turn out from the inside stop. <br>
<b>IN THE SHOP
</b>, mechanics have a tool called a Third Hand, which simultaneously pulls out 
the cable slack (while not pulling on the Pinch Arm) and allows the mechanic to 
reset the pinch bolt. The cable likes to jump out of the way during this 
process. If there is a grove for the cable on the pinch arm, insure that the 
cable is placed there.<br>
<b>IN THE FIELD</b>, Gently pull out (using pliers) 
the slack while you reset the pinch bolt. The perfect tension of pull is that 
all slack is out but no more effort than that. A new person may need to do this 
a couple two or three times until the work is as desired with a proper result 
(functional low gear shifting). Note that in the field, it is easy to break 
cable strands during the Pinch Bolt reset process. Handle the cable with 
minimum of force or effort.</li> 
<ol> <b>Two (2) Little Field Hints/Tricks for Long Tour Survival:</b> 
<li>Some long range bike 'tourers' melt some solder into the front derailer 
cable wire, in the area of where the derailer's pinch bolt meets the cable and 
at the cable's end/tip. One can have this done at a shop by a mechanic. This 
action helps to keep individual wire strands from breaking (and they do break 
over time/use from the clamp action).</li> 
<li>If one pulls a derailer cable wire by the 'end cap' (aka Crimp), one will 
likely pull off the end cap and the cyclist will not be able to remount the end 
cap and therefore will have loose strands at the cable's end, THUS making it 
more difficult to grasp the cable end for any derailer maintenance. One 
solution is to melt some solder into the cable wire's end. Another solution is 
to grasp the wire just before the end cap in order to perform any cable pulling 
for a derailer adjustment.</li> </ol> <br>
</ul> <i><b>Remember</b>, after 
adjusting and testing the gear limits,<b>re-set the gear settings to an easy 
start position</b> - nothing like mounting up and attempting to start a bicycle 
in High Gear (we've all done it ;-).</i> <br>
<br>
<b>2) Adjusting the Front 
Derailer's Mount Position: </b> 
<ol> Field Solution: 
<li>Undo the cable only at the derailer.</li> <br>
 RE-MOUNT INTRUCTIONS 
<li>Go to the shifter lever/grip/device (for the front derailer, usually on 
the handlebar, usually on the left side) and (if this exists) set the shifter's 
ferule out 1-2 full turns from all the way in (one may have to loosen and 
re-snug the shifter's adjustment barrel's lock ring).</li> 
<li>Loosely mount/adjust/place the derailer where it looks like it has been 
placed before. Place the shifter in the same position as the Derailer At-Rest's 
crank ring position (usually over Low Gear for the 'L' adjustment, i.e. over 
the smallest front ring or to be micro adjusted over the smallest ring).</li> 
<li>Run the chain through the cage, usually in a L-L front-rear combo (little 
front ring - big rear sprocket) or else set the chain for an H-H combination 
(big front ring - little rear sprocket).</li> 
<li>Square the derailer cage to the chain line (an imaginary line from the 
center of front rings to the center of the rear sprockets). This should look 
parallel to the centerline between the two straight tires (or center of a Trike 
or Quad), if not, this is an additional shop issue to address (later).</li> 
<li>Tighten the derailer mount, insuring that it does not move during the 
tightening process. Sometimes this takes a few redo's or adjustments.</li> 
<li>Connect the Cable to the pinch bolt with the derailer in the at rest 
position (insure that the cable is lying correctly in the placement grove, if 
it exists); proper cable lies are almost always straight with no significant 
bends. The cage should be over or close to being centered over a ring (usually 
the smallest ring). See Bullet #1, Previous.</li> 
<li>Pull the shifter cable at the middle of the nearest run (on the down tube 
or bottom tube) while simultaneously spinning the pedals; you are manually 
shifting (bypassing the shifter); look at the clearance of the cage over all 
the front rings. The cage should clear the closest gap of any of the crank 
rings by 1-2 mm - Closest Crank Ring means the closest ring to the cage for 
each and every ring whose proximity tolerance must be checked.</li> 
<li>Adjust the vertical as required - This may be best done by using a piece 
of wood and tapping the wood lightly with the equivalent of a soft head hammer; 
in the field one must get creative (I've used or seen used: a rock and a stick, 
a tent mallet and a tire tool, the hammer part of a hatchet and a plastic 
digging tool, plastic mini cutting board, plastic writing pen, and wood pencil 
[cut square ended]).</li> 
<li>Some derailers need to be fit perfectly and that is the only way they will 
work (to anyone's satisfaction) - In the field, accept Good Enough.</li> 
<li>Enter an iteration cycle of adjusting and micro adjusting the derailer 
longitudinally and angularly and spin the pedals while shifting as needed. 
Set/Re-set the H Limit and set the L Limit, looking for the chain to rail onto 
the ring, not go over, and not rub an adjacent ring and not rub the cage. Be 
sure to check the rear derailers function also, test every sprocket combination 
- it doesn't take long. If the cage were damaged, one may need to slightly 
bend/re-shape the cage (SeeReshaping a Damaged Cage).</li> 
<li>One may have to accept a limited set of gearing combinations. In the 
field, it's about survival. 'Good Enough' can get one out of the field and back 
to civilization. However, if the problem lies in the shape of the derailer 
cage, then consider reshaping the cage (see SeeReshaping a Damaged Cage, the 
following #3 Bullet).</li> 
<li>Be sure to properly torque the mounting and pinch bolts for the final 
settings. Don't put the tools away. Go for a good test ride. Make any final 
adjustments. Remember that in the field, a perfect adjustment may not happen; 
the repairs are being made to get the rider and the bike to a 'down the road' 
bike shop.</li> </ol> <br>
<b>3) Reshaping a Damaged Cage: </b> 
<ol> Field Solution: 
<li>If the cage is damaged or misshaped and one can get the bike to a bike 
shop, then do so. However, if one is on tour (in the field), then the cyclist 
will need to reshape the cage as best one can - this step can entail more art 
than science.</li> 
<li>If one knows the original cage shape, then that is the reshaping goal. If 
one does not know the cage's shape then try to square it more or less from a 
top-down view and make it parallel to the chain line (center line of the front 
rings to the center line of the rear sprockets).</li> 
<li>The two likely causes of a damaged derailer cage are an impact (crash or 
external caused, like a protruding branch or rock) or a jammed chain in the 
derailer cage (which usually bends the cage upward with a side twist). The 
'jammed chain' type of impact can be the most destructive. If one knows the 
cause of the impact, then one can work better to reverse the effect of the 
malevolent vector forces.</li> 
<li>There are repair bending motions such that some are better done with the 
derailer mounted on the bike and there are some bending motions better served 
with the derailer off the frame. Be mentally prepared to work both ways. 
Prevent any damage to the derailer's 4-Bar (main unit). See bullet #2 above, for
Front Derailer Re-Mount Instructions.</li> 
<li>Needle-nose Pliers are the best field tool, then regular Pliers, and then 
it's a tossup between a small crescent wrench or a set of grooved pliers (like 
Channel-Locks). Cage steel is tough to bend and brittle - it can break. It is 
difficult to work on the cage and not damage the four-bar support parallelogram 
- be smart and forceful with control.</li> 
<li>When making adjustments, be keenly aware of the vertical spacing between 
the cage and crank rings for each ring's position - Ultimately, one wants 1-2 
mm clearance from the closest cage-sprocket shifter setting of the set of all 
front rings.</li> 
<li>Start testing /shifting the derailer (cage) - make shape adjustments if 
needed.</li> 
<li>Cage design is <i>ubber</i> complex and sophisticated; the cage nose, 
middle, and tail may each have different chain railing/derailing 
concave/flat/curved shapes for chain shift management as well as high and low 
cage shape functions and every now and then a cage tail may be designed to 
curve away from the nose or that may the field solution when such did not exist 
before.</li> 
<li>The field solution may be to remove the front derailer and operate the 
front as a fixed gear and only use the rear derailer to shift as needed.</li> 
<li>Sometimes, one must ride out with a limited gear selection.</li> </ol> 
</ul> 
<h3>Tour Survival Hints: Front Derailer, Plus</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Drop some solder into the cable about the area of the pinch bolt contact
</b>; Have a mechanic perform this task or do it yourself. It helps to prevent 
strand breaks and insures that the cable will last longer.</li> 
<li>If one pulls a derailer cable wire by the 'end cap' (aka Crimp), one will 
likely pull off the end cap and the cyclist will not be able to remount the end 
cap and therefore will have loose strands at the cable's end, THUS making it 
more difficult to grasp the cable end for any derailer maintenance. One 
solution is to<b>melt some solder into the cable wire's end</b>. Another 
solution is to<b>grasp the wire just before the end cap</b> in order to perform 
any cable pulling for a derailer adjustment.</li> 
<li>If possible, as soon as one picks up a tuned bike from a shop (or you just 
tuned it perfectly OR as soon as it is opportune),<b>mark the juncture of the 
derailer and frame</b> (sometimes at two different places, using permanent 
marker [black or silver]) such that the stroke of the mark touches both the 
derailer and frame at the same time. Such an indicator is invaluable for 
re-aligning a derailer in case of damage, repair, removal, or replacement on 
the trail or at a foreign bike shop. See next Marking Bullet.</li> 
<li>One should <b>mark the juncture of the seat post stem and the seat post 
tube</b> such that the stroke of the mark touches both the stem and tube at the 
same time. Such an indicator is invaluable for re-posting or re-assembly of the 
bike's seat/saddle.</li> 
<li><b>Do NOT use a Scribe to mark anything</b> on a bike unless it is a mark 
for cutting or trimming a component. Scribes are metal pointed markers used for 
to mark material for cutting. The very scratch of a Scribe mark weakens the 
material/metal at that scratch mark; it is especially a 'No No' for seat posts!
</li> 
<li>If one is shipping and reassembling bikes (also see Bike Shipping for more 
shipping details), be sure to<b>mark other key component meeting points</b> 
(like the handlebar and stem). Marking determination depends on what components 
need to be removed for shipping and reassembly.</li> 
<li>There is nothing like having a <b>bipod stand</b> on a bike for a long 
tour to help one conduct shift tuning/adjustments in the field, a travel mate 
will appreciate it too.</li> </ul><br>

<h3>Rear Derailer Adjustment: </h3> Top &nbsp; Mechanical Issues Directory 
&nbsp;Front Derailer Adjustment<br>
<br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li><b>First</b>, If needed, conduct all Front Derailer adjustments First, 
Always.</li> 
<li>Understand the Derailer Adjustment Concept Picture/Diagram (the adjusting 
concept, adjusting screws and the screw stop concepts apply to the rear 
derailer too).</li> 
<li><b>Perform a quick visual check of the chain run</b>, especially if one 
has just transported the bike, performed shipping disassembly/reassembly work, 
added a new bike component, or the bike has crashed or fallen recently.We have 
seen new and remounted bottle cages get in the way of the chain run, the 
bottles themselves, pannier mount and rack pieces,<b>pannier bottom</b>, and a 
tire pump get in the way of a clean chain run or block derailer movement.</li> 
<li>This gets tricky! Many rear derailer cables have slack adjustment tension 
nuts on both ends. Make sure that the rear<b>barrel adjustor</b> cable housing 
is 'in' the ferrule. If one is in the field and one can see or feel that there 
is slack in the cable wire then make sure the barrel adjustor is NOT loose, 
check each end (if loose, fix) or else take the slack out - usually this only 
involves one or two 1/8 outward turns of the barrel adjustor (on rare occasions 
up to a couple full turns). After making an adjustment, test ride for 15 
minutes or so to see if this is all the adjustment that is needed. Otherwise, 
an adjustment in the field while on tour, probably should not involve making 
any cable tension adjustments.If the rider knows that the cable housing and 
wire were messed up and the rider knows that the cable wire needs to be 
reset/readjusted to the derailers pinch bolt, then while the cable is 
disconnected, reset the derailer's barrel adjuster to 2 full turns out from the 
inside stop and do the same thing on the shift lever (reset the barrel and 
locknut to 1 or 2 turns out from the inside stop).</li> 
<li>If rear panniers are mounted, <b>one may need to remove one or both 
panniers</b>. However, make a quick check to see if a pannier has interfered 
with any derailer/shifting/tranmission effectivness. Then, removing one pannier 
may be considered, just to obtain access to the rear derailer. Note that 
removing the other pannier may make it easier for someone to lift the rear end 
and test spin the drive train system adjustment.Sometimes we additionally turn 
the event into a snack/rest break - It helps to be of good cheer.</li> 
<li><b>Start at the L or H screw that represents the At-Rest-Position:</b> The 
At-Rest-Position is where the cage goes when it is un-connected to the shifter 
cable. Typically, the At-Rest-Position is the LOW (L) gear (chain and cage over 
the largest cog) position or else apply the following logic to the High (H) 
Position (chain and cage over the smallest cog).A way to validate the 
at-rest-position (without undoing the cable) is to place the shifter in either 
extreme gear setting (chain and derailer cage on largest or smallest ring) and 
physically pull in the middle of the cable (at the down tube or bottom tube for 
tandems +), if the cable pull moves the cage over another gear, then it started 
at the at-rest-position.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Usually Road Bike Rear Derailers usual default position is High Gear (H), 
little rear cog.*</li> 
<li>Usually Mountain Bike Rear Derailers usual default position is Low Gear 
(L), big rear cog.*</li> <br>
</ul>* There are exceptions and it has to do with 
the design of the four-bar parallelogram that holds the chain rail/derail cage.
<li>The chain must run through the cage and be on the Low Gear (largest rear 
cog) for the L Screw adjustments and the chain must be on the High Gear 
(smallest rear cog) for H screw adjustments.</li> 
<li><b>Sometimes the L and H screws are not labeled</b>. One must figure out 
which screw is which, in a majority of instances the L screw is to the outside 
on a front derailer and the inside on a rear derailer but this is NOT written 
in stone (it can be the other way around and it can be mixed - the safest 
analysis method is to actually look for the Stops and reverse think the 
mechanical functionality). Also, if one has the cage in the proper position 
(most inward or outward ring) and the chain is resting on said ring,<b>if one 
makes a screw setting adjustment and the cage does not move one knows that one 
is operating on the incorrect Derailer Adjusment Screw</b> (sometimes it takes 
a little effort to screw inward, but screwing outward 1/8 of a turn should 
result in an immediate visual micro movement of the cage). If one was rotating 
the incorrect derailer adjustment screw, be sure to place it in its original 
position and then move to the other Screw (and insure that the cage and chain 
are positioned correctly).<b>Seeing the cage move is proof that one is on the 
correct adjustment screw</b>(there are people who can feel and/or hear a 
perfect adjustment).</li> 
<li>Always test spin the pedals after an adjustment and run the shifter(s) 
through all gears (sprockets/cogs, rings) and always take a test ride before 
putting the tools away.Note: In the field, if one is travelling with panniers 
(vs just a trailer) one usually one has to remove one pannier (the right rear) 
just to get to the rear derailer. Sometimes it is easier to remove both 
panniers so that lifting the rear end is easier facilitated for test spinning - 
keep your sense of humor!</li> 
<li><b>Note</b>, in case you did everything perfectly and there is still chain 
noise, there are other things can causeChain Noise worth knowing and resolving.
</li> 
<li> <b>Note, this can be an issue for people who ship bikes and reassemble 
the bikes at their destination.</b> There is another screw on the Rear Derailer 
called the B Screw, it is usually on the mount of the derailer body where it 
contacts the bike's derailer frame/mount (it can be on back side of the 
derailer's mount). It is the 'Body Angle' (sometimes [Rear Derailer] Body 
Adjustment) Screw and it usually only needs to be set once in its lifetime. The 
B Screw adjusts the distance between the Guide Pulley and the Largest Rear 
Sprocket/Cog. The Guide Pulley should NOT touch the Cog at all, the Guide 
Pulley should be about 1 to 2 mm from the Largest Rear Sprocket (in the Lowest 
Gear setting for the rear derailer).</li> <br>
<br>
<i><b>Remember</b>, after 
adjusting and testing the gear limits,<b>re-set the gear settings to an easy 
start position.</b></i> </ol> 
<h3>Chain Line and Cross Chain Issues: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory
<br><br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Problem 1:</b> Some gear combinations force the chain to rub/grind 
sideways against the sprockets. Grinding metal against metal is never good. It 
can be heard most of the time but not always. It shortens the life of the drive 
train system and in a worst case scenario it may leave a cyclist stranded 
somewhere.</li> 
<li><b>Problem 2:</b> When the chain is in a line that is perfectly parallel 
to the bike frame, then the most energy from the cyclist's pedaling is 
delivered to the rear end - Cross chaining robs a cyclist of power.</li> 
<li><b>Solution:</b> Pedal in the Gear Combinations that offer the most energy 
return (which also happen to NOT have chain-sprocket side rub/wear).</li> 
<li><b>Technology:</b> The drive train 'Chain Line' is set up to use the Low 
(L) front crank ring (smallest and left/port most) with the Low/Lower rear 
cassette rings (which are the biggest and left/port most). So, in general, for 
low gearing, the chain lines up on the front and back sprockets on their 
respective left sides. This is good as is minimizes chain wear and maximizes 
rider power. Likewise the drive train is set up to use the High (H) front ring 
(biggest and right/starboard most) with the High/Higher rear rings (smallest 
and right/starboard most). The chain actually lines up squarely on the 
sprockets in varying H/H and L/L combinations - this is good. Middle (M) 
ring/gear combinations, front and back, achieve the same efficiency 
combinations - this is good too.</li> 
<li><b>Issue: Avoid H/L and L/H [cross-chain] combinations.</b> These poor 
combinations make the chain work at an angle across the sprockets and causes 
increased wear and tear on the system and it sometimes makes a notable ugly 
noise that sounds like metal meshing. For most touring bikers with full loads, 
the most likely temptation to cross chain occurs one has already made a steep 
hill climb and there is a little shallow [easier climbing] slope followed by 
steeper slope, again - why change the front ring when the cyclist is coming 
right back to granny in, 20 feet, for the remainder of the climb. Not saying 
this is right, just saying that this is the scenario that cross-chains a 
touring bike the most.</li> 
<li><b>10 Speed and 11 Speed Bicycles are much more sensitive to Cross Chaining
</b> because the chain is less wide and the rings and cogs are much closer 
together, to the point that a cyclist must consciously up-shift and down-shift 
from end to end maintaining sets of chain line combinations.</li> 
<h3>Some Good Tour Bike Characteristics:</h3> 
<li><b>Tour Bike (Longer Chain) versus Speed Bike (Shorter Chain):</b> The 
longer the drive train, the lesser the Cross Chain issue/sensitivity. Bikes 
with short drive chain runs are very sensitive to cross chaining than bikes 
with long drive chain runs. Bicycles with longer chain runs are much more 
tolerant of cross chaining situations (some with no sprocket-chain rub noise at 
all). A hidden issue is that bikes under tour loads are much more difficult to 
shift under pedal pressure, especially for the front rings especially for long 
hill climbs and/or for climbs involving multiple angle climb changes (ergo 
requiring more shifting at the top end of the rear sprockets versus shifting 
back and forth on the front ring which is much more likely to hang-up). A 
touring cyclist is much more likely to cross chain a bike to maintain power for 
a few seconds than a lightly loaded (relatively speaking) speed bike cyclist.
</li> 
<li><b>Tour Bike (Less Rear Sprockets) versus Speed Bike (More Rear Sprockets):
</b> If all conditions are the same, the more space that there is between rear 
sprockets the less likely the effect of cross chaining (causing side rub wear 
and causing chain noise) - Thus improving long distance endurance and 
dependability. This Inference is derived from a condition where more rear 
sprockets means a necessity for thinner walled chains and thinner walls do not 
endure as well as a thicker wall, thus a chain break is more likely given 
everything else being equal.</li> </ul><br>

<h3>Emergency Rear Derailer Setup for a Fixed Gear: </h3> Top Mechanical 
Issues Directory<br>
<br>
<b>Why? &nbsp; Because</b> someone crashed and the 
rear derailer no longer operates. The derailer may default to Low, sometimes 
beyond Low. A person can reset the rear derailer to contiuously run on just one 
sprocket. Which will it be? The following text reveals two different methods 
for setting the rear derailer to a desired sprocket.<br>
<br>
<b>Which Sprocket 
Setting? - Considerations:</b> A rider can coast downhill at a fast speed, 
regardless of a sprocket-chain setting. A rider can push uphill, sometimes 
nearly as quickly as one can ride. A rider cannot walk on the flats as fast as 
one can ride. Typically, one selects an interim speed sprocket setting, but 
there are exceptions (like getting to the Leadville, Colorado, Bike Shop and it 
is pretty much uphill all the way).
<h3>Choice, Use the existing derailer or remove the derailer!</h3> 
<h4>OPTION 1 - Use the Rear Derailer</h4> 
<ul> 
<li><b>The Big Picture:</b> A Rear Derailer needs to be set to one and only 
one selected gear position.<br>
This solution can be applied to the front 
derailer also.</li> 
<li><b>Situation:</b> The most common need for failed shifting capabilities 
results from crashes. There are a few other odd reasons. Crashes of this nature 
usually have a bent handlebar, destroyed shift system, and at least one good 
remaining brake.</li> 
<li><b>Default Indexed Derailer Position:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Mountain Bike Rear Derailers usually default to the lowest gear (biggest 
rear sprocket).</li> 
<li>Road Bikes Rear Derailers usually default to the highest gear (smallest 
rear sprocket).</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Steps:</b> 
<ol> 
<li>Detach derailer shift cable's inner-wire from housing.</li> 
<li>Remove the rear derailer's cable housing and stow away.</li> 
<li>If there is a cable housing ferrule at the barrel adjuster, then remove 
and stow away (with cable housing).</li> 
<li>If there is a barrel adjuster on the rear derailer, turn it out two turns 
from the all-the-way-in position.</li> 
<li>If the previously removed inner-wire has a good head and it has at least 5 
inches of good wire (not damaged or frayed from the crash) Use the wire, as is, 
for now. Else, tie an overhand knot in the wire close to a good end. Pull as 
much slack out of the wire as possible without breaking or fraying the wire. 
Try to get the knot small enough to fit inside the barrel adjuster (if 
possible). Do NOT trim yet.</li> 
<li>Run the good inner-wire end through the barrel adjuster (or rear entry 
hole if no barrel adjuster) toward and through the pinch bolt mechanism.</li> 
<li>Make an effort to remove any pending slack in the wire but do NOT pinch 
down yet.</li> 
<li>Using a friend (or a lever as last resort by yourself) and align the 
derailer parallelogram to the desired sprocket (usually the middle sprocket or 
next smallest) and fasten/lock-down/tighten the pinch bolt/mechanism. This may 
take a few iterations and be careful with the parallelogram.</li> 
<li>Use the barrel adjuster for fine adjustments (if it exists).</li> 
<li>Caveats:</li> 
<ol> 
<li>Sometimes one may have to get creative and tie cable at bottom of seat 
post for the rear derailer and run the inner-wire through the remaining cable 
housing.</li> 
<li>Cut off excess cable, but leave enough to allow the cyclist to reset the 
derailer parallelogram and/or selected sprocket.</li> 
<li>If available, finish the cable with an end cap, both to stop fraying and 
for safety.</li> </ol> 
<li>Ride out of harms way.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> 
<h4>OPTION 2 - Remove the Rear Derailer</h4> 
<ol> 
<li>Remove the Rear Derailer and Chain (use chain tool to undo chain or 
Master/Power-Link)</li> 
<li>Lie out and set up the chain on the middle sprocket, front and rear (or 
choose desired positions).The middle rear sprocket always leaves the most 
flexibility for setup and selection change due to chain length. The middle 
sprocket is usually the statistical best one gear only riding gear.</li> 
<li>Because of chain length fit, one may need to select an adjacent rear 
sprocket or change front ring selection.</li> 
<li>Use chain tool to remove enough links to reconnect chain with very little 
chain slack.</li> 
<li>According to rumor, all indirect reports, if the chain is loose enough, it 
may jump to the next biggest sprocket (lower gear) on its own. This is OK; 
consider it in your chain length plan.</li> 
<li>Caveats:</li> 
<ol> 
<li>This is a reason to think about carrying a half-link (find online).</li> 
<li>This is Dangerous and requires some bike mechanical knowledge, but some 
bikes will allow some chain slack to be removed by adjusting the rear wheel fit 
in the rear drop outs. Wheels do not have to be all the way up in a drop out, 
but a cyclist needs enough surface area that the skewers will hold and the 
wheel still needs to be center aligned for its track and for brakes (disk or 
pad).</li> 
<li>Stow away and keep the rear derailer, cable (housing and wire), remaining 
links, and anything else that came off the bike (doughnuts, ferules, ...).</li> 
<li><b>Warning</b> this can be dangerous but <i>sometimes</i> one can 
reposition the wheel rearward in the dropouts to adjust minute chain slack 
amounts.</li> </ol> </ol> 
<h3>Emergency Rear Derailer Hanger: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory<br>

<br> 
<ul> 
<li>First of all, some bike manufacturers make and sell replacement derailer 
hangers for their own bike frames, check with your shop.</li> 
<li>Second of all, many bike derailer hangers can be bent back into alignment 
with a special bike tool (in a shop - best option), a large adjustable wrench 
(preferred field option), or large tongue and groove pliers (second field 
option).</li> 
<li>Third, there is a commercial Emergency Rear Derailer Hanger product sold 
online and in shops. For online searches, one may need to use the word 
'derailleur' but the actual French word is<i>d&eacute;railleur</i>. 
Tomato-Tomoto.</li> 
<li>The emergency rear derailer hanger fits on the rear skewer and there is a 
lot of fore and aft adjustment/set-up lee way. Set the hanger in the same axial 
plain as the hole was for the original hanger.</li> 
<li>Some derailer to mount bolt threading can be funky. Be gentle and patient.
</li> 
<li>BTW, there is one multi-tool that has an emergency derailer hanger built 
into the tool frame (from Wheels Manufacturing, this is the same manufacturer 
of the Emergency Rear Derailer Hanger product).</li> 
<li>Most touring cyclists, that carry an Emergency Rear Derailer Hanger, keep 
it in their tool sack/bag but many mountain bikers zip tie one under their seat.
</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Because of a possible chain line offset with the emergency 
derailer hanger there may be a sprocket or two that may not be usable or 
attainable.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Before riding out, check the range of the derailer stops 
and Re-Tune as necessary (if possible). Start with the default derailer 
position first, it is possible that low gear on the derailer may now be sitting 
on the second or third sprocket also it is possible that a cyclist may have to 
mentally alert one's self to stop from using one or more of the high gears 
(smallest sprockets) due to possible derailer out of range limits. Know before 
you go.</li> 
<li><b>Thought:</b> This is an untried thought, but it seems that the 
emergency hanger could be hung Inside the frame's dropout as well as Outside 
the frame's dropout. It is not the dropout shape that holds a wheel to the 
axel; it is the skewer and the cam lock force. The result, possibly, provides 
another choice of gear ranges (high or low).</li> 
<li><b>Good News:</b> If a derailer frame hole is stripped, it is a very 
simple matter for most bike shops to tap a larger hole and drop in a Helix wire 
that is the exact same threading dimension as the original standard.</li> </ul>
<br> <br>
 &quot;Shifting is done as much with the eyes as with the hands. Most 
people don't anticipate.&quot;<br>

<br> 
<h3>Shift (When, How, How Much): </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>
<ul> 
<li><b>A slight easing of the pedal pressure while the bike moves from its own 
inertia allows for a smoother shift. The cyclist has to act in the function of 
a 'mechanical clutch',</b> disengaging pedal pressure as one leaves one 
front-rear sprocket-ring setting and withholding the pedal pressure until the 
chain is firmly engaged into the rider's next selection - this is all performed 
in less than a second (Michael Smart). [Otherwise, one is going to hear and 
feel the chain grind as it moves from the brute force of relocating the chain 
from one ring/sprocket to another ring/sprocket and there is a chance that the 
chain can hang-up in the basket and jam, thus stopping the bike as a minimum, 
or breaking the chain, but at worst the derailer may be destroyed.]</li> 
<li>The derailer is physically moving the chain by brute force sideways such 
that the chain may re-engage the next sprocket's teeth with less effort than if 
there is no fore-aft pressure. Fore-Aft pressure is usually only caused by 
pedal pressure from the rider.</li> 
<li><b>Downshift before a hill</b>, not on a hill (or else everything may come 
to a frustrating stop).</li> 
<li>It is wise to shift no more than two rear sprockets at a time, or else the 
chain may never catch up to the derailer and therefore seize/freeze (the chain 
wedges between the derailer cage and sprockets - can happen in the front 
derailer too), thus forcing the cyclist to stop and manually adjust the chain, 
derailer, and shifter.</li> 
<li>Sometimes the de-railed chain is moving so fast sideways, that it comes 
completely off the sprockets (when it would not happen under normal shift 
behavior). While this can be indicative of a mechanical problem, it is often a 
cyclist caused issue.This author experiences this issue of a fast shifting 
requirement when touring on mountain bikes on mountain trails or forest roads 
where there can be frenzied bursts of up and down shifting in a short period of 
time. Also, hard pedal pressure meant to bike out of a cage trapped chain often 
breaks the chain.</li> </ul><br>

<h3>Squeaking Derailer Pulleys (aka Jockey Wheels):</h3> Top Mechanical Issues 
Directory<br>
<br>
In real life, 99% of Derailer Pulleys come properly lubed 
from the factory and will never be a problem except that the teeth will wear 
out over time and the wheels will need to be replaced. But for whatever reason, 
1 in a hundred become noisy (a squeaky, every now and then, dry wheel-bearing 
kind of noise). Pulley's can be difficult to positively identify as a noise 
source; their grease can dry out and it is possible that they came from the 
factory with little or no grease.<br>
<br>
 Be very careful with Jockey Wheels, 
they can be different from one another. There are just Guide Pulleys and just 
Tension Pulleys or they can be interchangeable, depending on the system; they 
can be multiple colors; made of plastic, aluminum, titanium, or ceramic 
materials; they can have different counts of teeth; and they may contain ring 
bearings, cartridge bearings, or have tiny little internal [free] bearings that 
are just begging to be spilled onto the ground at a road side picnic table.<br>

<br> <b>The heart of the matter:</b> The Guide Pulley is closest to the rear 
cassette of sprocket disks and it guides the chain from one disk to another. 
The Tension Pulley keeps the slack out of the chain. Chain slack happens 
because the sprocket disks and crank rings are different sizes. Good chain 
performance comes from chains with no slack; 'chain tension' is more important 
than oil, and oil in important.
<ul> 
<li>Working with these little things can be tricky and time consuming, 
especially in the field. If possible, park the bike over a clean cement pad or 
lay a piece of plastic sheet (space blanket, ground cloth, ...) under the bike.
</li> 
<li>Next, one should break out a marking pen and a notebook pad, because a lot 
of parts look similar but are not and some pieces can go on backwards (and 
should not!).</li> 
<li>Getting the cage open is usually a straight forward process and it may 
require the derailer to be removed from the bike frame. Make cage alignment 
marks on the two cage pieces (like matching plus signs on each side of one end) 
- a lot of cages can be re-mounted upside down.</li> 
<li>The pulley axel bolts can be different from one another and should be 
marked (use a plus sign for the bolt that is closest to the cage's plus sign). 
There may be tiny washers.</li> 
<li>Remove the pulleys one at a time (do not pop the covers yet), and write 
down the markings on each pulley and on which side as they can be directional 
and it is best to remount everything just as it was. Sometimes, just one pulley 
may say what it is, thus the other pulley is for the other position.</li> 
<li>At a table or bench, protect an area for loose bearings, use a plastic 
sheet or news paper or plate or such. Be very careful at this time, because 
some of these jockey wheels can fall apart and they can have lots of little 
pieces. Pay attention here.</li> 
<li>Use a dental pick (or needle from sewing kit, Swiss Army knife's toothpick 
and/or tweezers) to pull off the covers.</li> 
<li>There may be tiny (plastic or vinyl) seals;<br>
<b>In the Field:</b> One 
should not disassemble any further, just clean out the old dirty grease as best 
one can. There may not have been any grease. If needed, consider using 
denatured alcohol, Coleman fuel, or just a clean rag for cleaning. In some 
cases, one will just be greasing the components, knowing that at the next good 
bike shop one will be replacing the jockey wheels.<br>
<b>In the Shop:</b> Take 
all the pieces out, line them up or take notes. There usually are no commercial 
replacement parts or seals, so what you take out must go back in. Clean out the 
old dirty grease. Use seal friendly solvent. Let it dry, or dry rub what one 
may. If a seal or component is bad, on will likely be purchasing new jockey 
wheels.<br>
<b>In Either Case:</b> Some of these wheels have tiny bearing 
cartridges, some have tiny loose bearings, and some are just plastic with a 
cover. If the jockey wheels are just plastic (no bearings), be sure to clean 
and grease the area that was under the covers. For any Jockey Wheel, if nothing 
else, heavily grease the bearings if they exist and add a little grease on each 
side (under the cover area) and put it back together.</li> 
<li>Just so that the reader knows, NO ONE that we know of, sells just jockey 
wheel seals or parts. One must buy new wheels; they range from 5 USD to 95 USD, 
each.</li> 
<li>Re-assemble everything.</li> 
<li>When putting the jockey wheel bolts into the cage, if one can, add a 
little LocTite to the pulley bolt threads, remember to re-thread the chain, and 
add a little LocTite to the cage bolts (or add your preferred thread-lock of 
choice, use purple before blue, but blue is OK). Read aboutThread Lock.</li> 
<li><b>Note:</b> Any time that the derailer is off the bike is a good time to 
wipe it clean, place a drop of oil on each of the 8 parallelogram pivots, work 
the parallelogram, oil the swing arm pivots (no oil on or near the cable or its 
attachment point), work it a few times and then wipe the excess/visible oil off 
the parts/components.</li> </ul> <br>

<h3>Mystery Shifting (aka Ghost Shifting or How to cause a Crotch Shot):</h3> 
Top Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>
 The Derailer discussion (previous) 
addressed the topic of a bicycle not shifting on command and this following 
topic addresses bicycle un-commanded shifting, that is,<b>the bike shifts 
unexpectedly on its own.</b> The following percentage estimates are just based 
on personal experience.<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>70-80% of the time, Mystery Shifting is caused by drive train 
miss-alignment</b>. Most commonly this is caused by a bent derailer hanger, 
wheel/axel dropout (thus effecting rear sprocket alignment), chain stay (bent, 
ditto), or seat stay (ditto, pretty much in that order, 80% being a bent 
hanger, easy to have fixed, recognition of problem is the key). An aside: this 
is the<b>reason why most cyclists lay or transport (or rest) their bike to the 
left side (versus right side), to keep the derailer off any objects</b>. A bent 
frame component causes the rear wheel cassette to NOT line up with the front 
crank ring(s), which results in the chain alternately aligning with the front 
crank or rear cassette, thus causing un-commanded gear shifting. The solution 
requires some professional mechanic frame bending with special tools (usually, 
but sometimes a frame break and weld is in order).</li> 
<li><b>5% of the time, Mystery Shifting is caused by slightly too loose (or 
too tight) a shift cable.</b> Many bikes have a barrel adjustor on the rear 
derailer for the shift cable, some don't, but most bikes have a front cable 
adjustor at the shifter. Shift cable adjustments are not needed very often but 
one way to tell is that the chain should sit centered on the chain ring. This 
is an adjustment better made with the bike upright or in a rack (as opposed to 
upside down). If the chain is rubbing against the next sprocket/ring (inward or 
outward of the present sprocket/ring) then a fine adjustment to the barrel 
adjustor (usually 1/8th of a rotation to lengthen the cable run within the 
housing) will re-center the chain on the sprocket. If your adjustment just made 
more noise or made shifting occur two sprockets at a time, then back off the 
adjustment and try the other direction.</li> 
<li><b>IF a bike has frame couplers</b> for shipping (most don't), THEN <b>
Mystery shifting is often a symptom of coupler(s) working loose</b>, usually at 
the bottom coupler position(s).</li> 
<li>1% of the time, Mystery Shifting can be caused by a <b>bent sprocket 
tooth/point</b>. This situation also <b>produces the sound like Chain Trim Noise
</b>, a sound indicating that the chin cannot decide on which ring to be (a 
sound like a derailer that needs tuning). What happens is that an adjacent ring 
will be bent just enough, sideways, that during rotation the bent sprocket 
tooth/point can push the chain off the current ring and onto the next ring. 
This brute force push of the chain can be in either direction (up or down the 
cassette). Also this can happen in the rear cassette for just one front chain 
ring and not the other(s), having to do with the angle/alignment of the chain 
going to the rear cassette.<b>In the field</b>, Sprocket Points can be gently 
bent with an adjustable wrench - Bend only the tip, not the ring.<b>In a Bike 
Shop</b>, there are special tools for this procedure and the Mech/Tech may have 
to disassemble the chain cassette in order to get at the correct ring without 
damaging other rings.</li> 
<li>1% of the time, Mystery Shifting can be caused by a worn out or defective 
derailer or shifter at the handlebar.</li> 
<li>1% of the time, Mystery Shifting is accidently caused by the cyclist's 
hand, resting on the handlebar shifter.</li> 
<li>The worst time for a mystery shift is when standing on the pedals for a 
hill climb, invariably a cyclist gets the saddle driven up the crotch - Ouch!

<br><br>

<h3>Chain Facts and Background: </h3> 
<ul> Almost all new chain pin/rivet centers are exactly one half (1/2) an inch 
apart from center to center (called pitch) or it can be measured from the front 
of the roller to the front of the next roller. The bicycle chain's 1/2 inch 
pitch measure (and international chain pitch standard) traces back to the first 
days of chain-driven velocipedes (old high-wheel style bikes; this was before 
anyone realized that by using a chain, one could have smaller wheels). Most new 
chains, for almost every chain based bike created today, have a 1/2 inch pitch 
(99.99%).<br>
<br>
<i>More Facts:</i> One link is 1 inch and is composed of 2 
linear link plates (an outer plate and an inner plate connected about a 
pin/rivet). The outer plates and the rivet/pin are fixed (usually stamped, 
peened, and/or riveted - not supposed to move on one another); the inner plate 
is supposed to rotate about the pin/rivet.<br>
<br>
<b>What No One Tells You:
</b> The Outer Plates are attached to the Pin (or Rivet) - The Outer Plates and 
Pin/Rivet<i>do not rotate</i> because the Outer Plates and Pin/Rivet are one 
fixed component. It is the Inner Plates and Roller that must freely rotate 
around the Pin (or Rivet). The Inner Plates give the chain its linked 
flexibility and rotation ability. It is the Rollers that wear out (inner 
diameter and outer diameter) and give cause to replace the chain.<br>
How to 
Re-Attach a Broken Chain. How to Loosen a Kinked Chain. <br>
<br>
<b>Terms 1:
</b> A <i>9 Speed Chain</i> means that the chain is made for a bicycle that has 
9 cogs on the rear wheel/hub; therefore a 10 Speed Chain is for a bicycle that 
has 10 cogs on the rear wheel/hub.<b>A 9 Pin replacement Pin is just for a 9 
speed chain pin</b>, ditto 10 Pin for 10 speed chain. [No 10 pin bowling jokes 
today.] One may see a pin designation like<b>7/8 Pin</b> or 7/8 Link, which 
means a link or<b>pin that works for 7 or 8 speed chain pin replacement</b>. 
Usually, especially for warranty and safety purposes, a cyclist will want to 
use pins and links made by the same manufacturer as the chain, but there are 
3rd party vendors that sell replacement pins and links that warrant their 
products as suitable for use with certain chains. 3rd Party Vendor means 'Not 
the Manufacturer' and 'Not the Bike Shop'. It just happens that many 7 and 8 
speed chain parts are sometimes compatible with one another (explained in the 
next paragraph)<br>
<br>
 Most multi speed chains (aka derailer chains, which 
means chains used for shifting Versus chains for fixed gear bikes [sometimes 
called 'Fixies']) run on 3/32&quot; (2.38mm) wide rollers. So,
<ol> 
<li>No matter how many sprocket rings a derailer bike has, the sprockets 
themselves must operate a chain using 3/32&quot; (2.38mm) wide rollers, and</li>
<li>While chains get more and more narrower overall for cassettes with more 
and more sprockets (10 speed and 11 speed rear cassettes) the inside diameter 
for the chain has remained at 3/32&quot; (2.38mm).</li> </ol> So far, only the 
chain width is getting narrower, but not the roller nor the sprocket for 10 and 
11 speed systems.<br>
<br>
<b>Bicycle Chain Quick Summary</b>: All Bicycle 
Chain Pitch's are 1/2&quot; (inch) from roller center to center (or front to 
front) with an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) set of common 
design and measure characteristics. A Link is formed by two half links and is 
1&quot; in total pitch and consists of two inner and two outer plates (and 
their components: pins, rollers, and formerly bushings). The main chain unit is 
fixed and does not flex; it is the inner links that rotate about the main chain 
unit (around a pin or rivet).<br>

 - I.D. = 
Inside Diameter, O.D. = Outside Diameter.<br>
 - The Inside Diameter is the 
distance between two inner plates, not to be confused with the diameter of the 
roller but it can be the nominal roller width.<br>
 - The Outside Diameter is 
the greatest distance between, either, the outside of the outer plates or the 
outside of the widest pin/rivet [John Barnett]. Admittedly, some stated O.D. 
Chain Dimensions may have measured only the greatest outer plate distance (when 
rivets may be slightly wider). It is often the pin or rivet that wears on a 
neighboring sprocket and that is why the greatest diameter distance is the most 
important measurment - Also that is a reason why one looks for protruding pins 
or rivets in a chain inspection.<br>
 - HINT: If old cogs are wider than 2.6mm 
then the chain must be 1/8&quot; (and not 3/32&quot;).<br>
 - Almost all chain 
measurements presented here are sourced to Barnett's Manual DX v7.09 or 
Mechanic Classroom Education Handouts at BBI (2010.02) or John Barnett himself 
(4/7/2010, 6/28/11). </ul> 
<h3>Terms 2, Extended/Related Chain Issues: </h3> 
<ul> The rear group of sprockets can also be called a cassette or a cluster 
and may have none, one, more, or all sprockets be replaceable as individual 
sprockets (often directly proportional to cost). Older bikes had sprockets 
called cogs on a<b>Freewheel (part of the hub)</b> versus, now mostly on a <b>
Free-Hub (independent of the hub or free of the hub)</b>. Technically, cog and 
gear are inappropriate words because gears are driven by a drive gear and NOT 
driven by a Chain; Cogs, supposedly, are for On-Hub Mounts (verses an 
Off-the-Hub mount) - However, the front sprocket/ring sizes and rear 
sprocket/cog/cassette sizes (identified by Tooth count where the teeth have a 
1/2 pitch) combine to yield different [gearing] ratios (that yield different 
linear inch measurements per wheel revolution). BMX means Bicycle Mountain 
Cross-country. A bike with a 5 speed rear freewheel and 2 front crank rings was 
called a 10 speed bike (5 x 2). So a 10 speed bike has a 5 speed chain and a 5 
speed rear cluster but don't confuse the term '10 speed bike' with '10 speed 
chain', two different ideas.<br>
<br>
 Two leading bicycle chain manufacturers 
are Shimano and SRAM (initials of owners, pronounced Schram); many other good 
manufacturers exist in the market place. At present, all Shimano bicycle chains 
use pins and only pins for connecting or reconnecting chains. SRAM uses master 
links to connect or reconnect chains. As one may imagine, different chain 
speeds use different link sizes. As far as I can determine, SRAM links are 
called PowerLinks for size 7, 8, and 9 speed chains; 7 and 8 speed PowerLinks 
are interchangeable (because the chain dimensions are the same). SRAM 
PowerLinks are reusable in size 7, 8, and 9 - However, size 10, called a 
PowerLock is not reusable. It is highly advised (for safety and warranty) that 
when one installs a 'new' SRAM 7, 8, or 9 speed chain, one should use a new 
PowerLink(s). SRAM PowerLock 10 is a one-time use only kind of connecting link. 
Meanwhile, as one may now intuit, Shimano has different replacement pins for 
each chain speed and one should never reuse a pin (for Warranty, liability, and 
safety purposes). Whew.<br>

<h3>Chain Length: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain Sub-Directory
<br><br>

<h4>For Derailer Shift Systems:</h4> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Chain TOO SHORT Rule:</b> The Chain Length is too short when the chain 
fits around the bicycle's Two Largest Cogs/Rings and the chain only contacts 
two or less teeth of the pulleys (aka jockey wheels) at any time.The chain is 
long enough if it touches three pulley teeth of either pulley.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Chain TOO LONG Rule:</b> The Chain Length is too long when the chain 
fits around the bicycle's Two Smallest Cogs/Rings and the chain touches itself 
after running around the tension pulley.No slack in the top chain run.</li> <br>
<br> 
<li><b>Chain BEST LENGTH:</b> <b>There is NO Perfect Chain Length Formula</b> 
that always works for every cassette, crank, derailer, or chain combination.
</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>If the Old System's Chain Length was OK and NO Componets were changed:
</b> If just replacing the chain, then make the new chain the same length as 
the old chain.</li> 
<li><b>Different Components or Bicycle? Size the Chain:</b> Set the shifters 
for the smallest cogs, front and rear. Thread the chain through the cages and 
hold the chain with aChain Holder such that chain link(s) may be added or 
subtracted to the on bike chain length. Add full links (two link plates in a 
row) one full link at a time to the Chain Holder until the chain is too long 
(per the above Chain TOO LONG Rule). Then shorten the chain by 1 to 3 plates, 
depending on using pins or a master link. Before actually connecting the chain 
ends, validate that there will not be a violation of the Chain TOO LONG Rule or 
the Chain TOO SHORT Rule.</li> 
<li><b>A GOOD Bicycle Chain LENGTH General-Rule:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Before:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Some bikes with rear suspension shock systems flex in a manner that pulls 
on the chain and therefore the chain needs to be measured for the fully 
stretched state.</li> 
<li>Some bikes have adjustable fore-aft rear axle mounts, reset to shortest 
adjustment setting (realizing that one can lengthen but not shorten the run).
</li> 
<li>Some bikes have eccentric (adjustable) crank housings, reset to shortest 
adjustment setting (or neutral housing setting and be sure to NOT move the 
eccentric's chain line left or right).</li> 
<li>Some multi-gear hubs, internal hubs, and/or automatic gear systems may 
have a chain adjustment setting, reset to shortest adjustment setting or re-set 
as directed/required by the system manual (also, a cable adjustment may be in 
order).</li> 
<li>Note that when unusual components or new components are present, one 
should check its affect on chain length and chain line.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li>Run the chain around the largest rings (cage threading is not usually 
needed but with two ring front derailers one may need to thread through or else 
the cage may be in the way).</li> 
<li>Pull the chain tight (the chain usually wants to fall off, use a friend or 
device to prevent the chain from falling off).</li> 
<li>Note: How the chain meets for connection can be different, depending on 
whether a master link is used (inner plate to inner plate) or if a pin is used 
(inner plate to outer plate) - properly account for correct chain meet-up.</li> 
<li>Determine where the links will meet AND account for whether it is a pin or 
masterlink connection. If the links don't quite come together then add another 
link or half link (depending on whether a pin or masterlink is to be used). 
Don't mark or cut the chain yet, there is another step.</li> 
<li>Note the count/measure point AND Add One more Full Link (1 inch) to that 
measure. Mark or tape the chain for a break point (pin removal location) BUT 
don't un-pin the chain yet.</li> 
<li>Set the derailers (for Big to Big sprockets), thread the chain through the 
cages and around the pulleys, tie the chain where it needs to meet (adjust for 
the absence of a master link if that is the connection method), then Double 
check for any reason that the chain should be longer AND validate that the 
chain does not exceed theChain-too-Short Rule (previous section). Adjust the 
break/un-pin point if needed.</li> 
<li>Re-Set the derailers and chain (Small to Small sprockets) AND validate 
that the chain does not fail theChain-too-Long Rule (previous section). Adjust 
the break/un-pin point if needed.</li> 
<li>Break/Un-Pin the chain (as required), ensure that the chain is setup 
through the Derailer Cages and Pulleys AND then connect the chain (See How to
Pin or Masterlink a Chain).</li> </ol> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>About New Chains: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain 
Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
 Some new chains come <b>Pre-Lubed</b> with good 
lubrication oil and some chains arrive with a<b>Preservative</b> that is 
suspected of being Cosmoline (or like Cosmoline).
<ol> 
<li>If a cyclist gets a <b>factory oil lubed chain</b> or the factory installs 
pre-lubed chains, then there is no need for further action, HOWEVER there is 
nothing wrong with a re-lube for peace of mind.</li> 
<li>Cosmoline was originally a military rust and corrosion preservative that 
feels like an ultra thin coating of tar. Cosmoline is now used all over the 
world as a metal preservative. While Cosmoline or similar preservatives prevent 
rust or corrosion, it attracts and holds dirty particles like dust, dirt, or 
earth debris. Dirty Cosmoline will not hurt idle parts but dirty parts will 
wear faster when put into motion (like on a Cosmoline treated bike chain).</li> 
<li>If a cyclist gets a <b>chain with Cosmoline</b>, then clean it off (it 
gunks up the system and collects/holds dirt and dust). Several/many wipes with 
a clean rag will remove most of the Cosmoline, and wiping hard a few times with 
some regular bicycle oil will do a sufficient enough cleaning job. Keep 
cleaning until one can drag the chain through a rag in a tight fist without any 
fibers being pulled out of the rag.<b>WARNING:</b> Do NOT use gasoline! 
Cleaning with Gasoline is a safety issue and NOT a cleaning issue.</li> </ol> 
<h3>Chain Wear: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br> 
<ul> It is the roller system that wears out (what wears is the roller [inside 
and outside], bushing [if it exists], and to a lesser extent the chain 
rivet/pin). So, as a chain wears over time, the pitch changes (increases in 
length) and the changing pitch effects increased wear on the connecting 
sprockets. Chain pitch wear is often, incorrectly, called 'Chain Stretch' (the 
length of the chain never changes). Thus, a worn chain mal affects sprocket 
wear. John Barnett states that whether a chain has bushings or not does not 
affect the chain oiling method [Barnett Manual DX, Ver 7, Ch 26, 2010].<br>

<h3>Chain Life Expectancy: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain 
Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
 How many miles should a bicycle chain last? The 
question is a bit like asking 'How long should an automobile last'. The answer 
depends on many, to be presented, variables.
<ul> 
<li>Road bikers (but not necessarily on a road bike) who are light weight, 
ride in flats or who take hills casually, avoid rain and dirt areas, and clean 
their chains regularly (like weekly) often report getting 2,000 miles (or more) 
out of their chains (with a few reports of 4 to 6 thousand miles).</li> 
<li>Cyclists who ride at gusto, always, tend to get around 1000 miles 
(800-1200 miles). This is a riding style, there is always pedal pressure and 
they are often out of their seat. Bike type does not matter but this is still 
mostly from fair weather, hard riding, and hard road miles.</li> 
<li>Hills (taken strongly) and/or all day mountain rides (time spent mostly 
climbing) can shorten the life of a chain by as high as 25% but 10-15% is 
typical.</li> 
<li>By far, people who ride on hard roads, versus dirt roads, get more miles 
from their chain. There can be a 15-25% chain wear difference just for riding 
on dirt roads.</li> 
<li>The Rider's weight matters; more weight in identical conditions will 
always result in more chain wear (it shortens chain life expectancy). A 170 
pound rider will have about 5-15% more chain wear than a 115 pound rider. A 220 
pound rider will have 10-25% more wear than a 115 pound rider.</li> 
<li>Gross bike weight matters, the more the load on a bike, the more that the 
bike chain wears. A loaded touring bike with panniers will cut chain life by 
15-25%.</li> 
<li>Dirt or dirty conditions shorten chain life. By the very environment that 
people ride mountain bikes (MBs) there is more wear on the bike chain because 
of dirt wear in the chain that results from dirt in the environment. MBs get 
about a 15-25% reduction in expected chain life.</li> 
<li>Bicycle trailers offer automatic chain wear. Just adding one wheel 
increases road rolling resistance by 33% (pedal effort). Put a load in a 
trailer and typical chain wear increases 15-25% but this wear can be 
accumulative with dirty chain wear and added weight chain wear which can 
increase wear by 25-50%.</li> 
<li>Here's the typical <i>Coup de Gr&acirc;ce</i>: A bike setup with panniers 
(front and back) with a trailer, performing something like the Great Divide MB 
Route (no matter the type of bike) will be lucky to get as little as 50% chain 
wear - it can be worse.</li> 
<li>The rear drive chain of a Tandem gets about twice (2x) as much wear as 
solo bike chains per unit of time.</li> 
<li>A tandem with panniers and a trailer on a mountain road can see 
accumulative chain wear in the 60% shorter chain life expectancy range.</li> 
<li>Typical real tour loads range from 40 to 80 pounds.</li> 
<li>Ultralight Riders strive to get their load between 20 and 25 pounds 
(lighter is better).</li> 
<li>Chains that are cleaned often (typically using a penatrant) and are 
thoroughly dried (compresses air, stove/oven bake dry) done weekly and followed 
by a proper lubrication will last twice as long (sometimes a little longer) 
than a chain that is maybe cleaned once month, all other conditions being the 
same.</li> 
<li><b>Measuring Chain Wear:</b> There are bike-shop tools that can indicate 
the states of chain wear but there is a simple do it yourself test. Take the 
chain off the bike, lay it out on a clean surface (ideal if there is a small 
nail brad to gently pull the chain slack away) and then measure the distance to 
the 12th link on the far away side of the roller while pulling on the 
12.5&quot; link (12 links or 24 pins is 12 inches, a link is one outer plate 
pair and one inner plate pair, new roller pitch is exactly 1/2 inch when new) 
so the accumulated distance at 12 links should be exactly 12 inches. If the 
total test measured distance is between 12 + 1/16 inch and 12 + 1/8 [=2/16] of 
an inch, then the chain is to be replaced with a new chain (the chain is worn 
enough to start mal-affecting the rings and sprockets - replace it! - See next 
related Bullet).<br>
<b>Consideration</b>: If a cyclist is on tour and at a 
bike shop and the chain is close to 12 + 1/16 inches (at 12 links or 24 pins, 
strecthed), then consider installing a new chain if you are not likely to see a 
bike shop within 14 cycling days (2 cycling weeks).</li> 
<li>Sometimes, at super close chain inspection, one may find one roller that 
is extra worn or damaged. If the rest of the chain is OK, then it is OK to 
consider replacing just that link section, especially if one happens to have a 
few spare similarly worn links.<br>
<b>Experience</b>: Carry a few spare links 
for emergency link replacement and remember to try to be sure that the spare 
link types match the current chain type (9 speed vs 10 speed, pins for 
chain-pin match). The other important reason to carry spare links is to replace 
busted/bent links on a broken chain; this should be part of the tool/repair kit.
</li> 
<li>It's cheaper to replace a chain than worn rings and sprockets.</li> 
<li>As a rule of thumb, light casual bike riding in ideal conditions and never 
in dirt or mud will facilitate an environment where<b>rings and sprockets</b> 
may last for five or six chain replacements (i.e., in ideal conditions rings 
and sprockets may last 5,000-6,000 miles). There are many bikes out there on 
their original rings and sprockets (those bikes are not used for touring). 
Typical Touring Bikes have rings and sprockets that may last for 4,000 miles 
(about four chain replacements) and the heavy duty tour bikes (panniers and 
trailer on mountain environments with camp equipment) may last for 3,000 miles 
(about three chain replacements). This is based on all of the previously listed 
assertions. Light loads and light riders will have little better results.</li> 
<li>In general, thicker chains seem to last longer than thinner chains. Said 
another way, 8 Speed chains generally outlast 9 speed chains in identical usage 
environments, 8 is generally better than 9, ... . See the general chain
width/size chart.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Chain Tools Usage Notes: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain 
Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
 Most chain tools have two chain holding Cradles/Mounts.
<br><br>
 Concepts:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>The Front Cradle (or Near Cradle) is designed to work on just one 
(outer) chain plate, the front most chain plate.</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>A bicycle chain Pin may only be pushed (not pulled).</li> 
<li>Only the front chain plate is affected.</li> 
<li>The back chain plate just moves along with the pin movement.</li> 
<li>There is no pin movement on the back plate.</li> 
<li>In order to affect the back plate, the chain unit must be FLIPPED over, 
thus the back plate becomes the front plate.</li> 
<li>If the inner plates are too tight on the outer plates (or vice versa) then 
the pin (on at least one chain side, maybe on two sides) needs to be pushed a 
little more, in order to release the friction/binding between the inner 
plate(s) and the outer plate(s).</li> 
<li>ALL pin and plate Logical Solutions can only involve pin pushing.</li> 
</ul> 
<li><b>The Back Cradle (or Far Cradle) is designed to work on both (outer) 
chain plates, the front and back chain plates.</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>A bicycle chain Pin may only be pushed (not pulled).</li> 
<li>The back cradle holds, both, the front chain plate and the rear chain 
plate steady</li> 
<li>A pin can be and will be pushed through both chain plates.</li> 
<li>In order to connect a chain, a pin must be pushed through a pair of Outer 
Plates, Inner Plates, and a Roller.</li> 
<li>The distance between the chain tool's back cradle and back wall is fixed 
and favors a particular (usually specified) chain speed or type (for example 
7/8 speed chain versus 9 speed chain; generally a 7/8 speed chain is slightly 
wider than a 9 speed chain). See Chain Widths</li> 
<li>ALL pin and plate Logical Solutions can only involve pin pushing.</li> 
</ul> <br>

<li><b>Issue:</b> Different chains have different widths, so a chain tool 
cannot be universally perfect for every chain. Some chain fixes will 
necessitate a little plate position adjusting in order to have even link 
flexibility and pin/rivet evenness (so a slightly protruding pin/rivet does not 
hang up in a derailer cage to mal effect smooth shifting)</li> 
<li><b>Wisdom:</b> When connecting additional link segment(s) be sure to align 
the link plates such that the direction is the same, some indicators are 
numbers or characters on the side plate that should read the same for existing 
and replacement links (not upside down, not reversed). Some chains have special 
groves and notches that are designed to benefit shifting, in fact, because of 
this, it is suspected that some Campagnolo broken Chains have to replace six 
links at a time (for something like the chain groove and notch issue) - the 
point is that replacement links should be arranged like the original chain's 
links.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> A tight link (link bind) can cause shifting problems. A 
Link Bind is a connection that is so tight that the chain does not flex of bend 
as it rolls across the sprockets or it can sometimes be viewed as kinked in 
clear air - a person can see a kink in the chain line as it moves through its 
path. A chain kink (link bind) must be loosened (mechanically by tool and/or 
physically by hand).<i>Read Next Bullet ...</i></li> 
<li><b>Wisdom:</b> The Loosening mount (or front cradle) of a chain tool 
allows one to apply direct force, reverse force (flip chain over), or just the 
hold chain while the person flexes the chain back and forth such that the new 
pin/link connection is no tighter than the rest of the chain links. Sometimes 
the repair person just has to get a little tough on the manual bending and 
lateral flexing motions.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Chain Holder: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain Sub-Directory
<br><br>

<h4>How to make a simple Flat 'C' shaped 'Chain Holder', Mod 3</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Get hold of a thin old spoke or a light to medium duty coat hanger. Shape 
it such that the Flat C's wide points are 1.9 to 2.0 inches apart.<br>
<b>Note:
</b> Wider spokes and heavy duty coat hangers may be too thick for insertion 
between chain inner plates (to be just less than 3/32 inch or 2.38 mm).<br>
<b>
Note:</b> If a the resulting Chain Holder is a hair too thick, then a little 
side/lateral hammer pounding on the leg ends at the vise anvil is justified 
(and works).<br>
<b>Note:</b> Chain Holders do not have to be too strong - they 
are just a convenient 3rd hand 'chain hold together and hold off the ground' 
tool.</li> 
<li>One can make a jig by hammering two nails, 1.9 to 2.0 inches apart, into a 
piece of wood. One wants a little slack in the chain ends as it helps the 
pieces fit together easyer</li> 
<li>It does not have to be fancy looking.</li> 
<li>Bend and shape by hand and/or with pliers.</li> 
<li>Trim the legs after the shape is formed.</li> 
<li><b>Important:</b> File the end cuts free of any burs (or it can scratch a 
roller).</li> 
<li>Keep one in each tool kit.</li> 
<li>Give as gifts.</li> </ul> 
<h4>How to Use the 'Chain Holder' for Broken Chain Repair</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>It is used to hold two chain ends near each other and to keep the chain 
off the ground. Chains are attracted to the ground like the peanut-butter side 
of bread.</li> 
<li>The best placement of a Chain Holder is to hook the pins on each side of 
the chain end about 1 inch back from each end, thus the end links are ready to 
be pinned (or master linked). In some cases, the Chain Holder will not fit in 
between the inner plates, so in that situation the chain holder will have to be 
fitted between only the outer plates.</li> 
<li><i>In lieu of having a 'C' hanger,</i> one may <i>use a re-usable zip tie, 
string, wire tie, or a volunteer</i> to hold the chain ends together (to keep 
the chain off of the ground and from a free run).</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<h3>How to Lube a Chain: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain 
Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
 Most chains made from the mid 1990's onward are <b>
Bushingless Bearings</b>. There are a few different methods for oiling chains 
in the cycling industry: most methods are OK, one method is perfect but 
expensive, and yet another method has effective results and is still economical 
in its application. NOTE that ALL Chain Lubrication Methods need the chain 
cycled/pedaled through each and every ring/sprocket (for their lubrication).
<ol> 
<li><b>Method A - The Best Lubrication Method</b> is to submerse the chain in 
clean oil. Waiting/ Soaking/Penetration Time is proportionately longer for 
heavier viscosity oils. If possible, flex all of the chain components. Pull the 
chain out after a sufficient plate gap and roller penetration, let drip dry 
momentarily. It is better to wipe excess oil off the chain before it is mounted 
to the bicycle (or re-cleaned), but the excess oil and chain can be wiped away 
while on the bike. This method is very time consuming and expensive.</li> 
<li><b>Method B</b> (as in BBI - hmmm) - <b>BBI</b> has studied chain oiling 
methods and the best on-bike application method is very logical.<b>FIRST</b>, 
the places on a chain that need lubrication are therollers (which ride 
rivets/pins or drive sprockets and are driven by cranks) and thelink plate 
surface areas (which rub adjacent link plates, rub against rollers, and ride on 
the link pin/rivet[or rarely a roller may ride on a bushing, which in turn 
rides on a pin/rivet]). <b>SECOND</b>, if one quickly streams oil, using a 
narrow straw tube from/on an oil bottle, across a line where the link plates 
and roller cross the chain rivet/pin, then one can lubricate the roller and 
chain plate gaps of one pin and each chain pin must be treated in the same 
manner. See the Following Picture. Experienced cyclists use a Z or N shaped 
oiling pattern/motion and the<b>Z/N Oil Method</b> (my made-up name) takes 
about 30 seconds longer than the former/traditional chain roll drip method 
(Cat/BBI). This method works effectively, efficiently, and economically, once 
one gets a little application practice.</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>Method C</b> - Oiling the gap on each plate side (in two 
stages/chain-runs, once for each side). This method is OK but may miss 
some/many center rollers.</li> 
<li><b>Method D</b> - Moving the drip bottle over the center of a stationary 
chain, the chain is rotated in increments between the crank ring and the 
cassette/cogs; the chain can be lubed on the top run and the bottom run within 
the same cycle/setting/rotation; somewhere between 2 and 3 crank rotations will 
usually achieve full chain exposure. This method is OK but may miss some/much 
side plate gap lubrication (between the inner and outer chain plates).</li> 
<li><b>Method E</b> - Dripping the oil bottle in one spot while manually 
rotating the chain (backwards). This method is OK but misses some rollers and 
may miss many side plate gaps.</li> </ol> <b>Note:</b> ALL of the methods of 
chain<b>oil application</b> need the chain to be <b>forward or reverse 
cycled/pedaled</b> through each and every ring/cassette (for their 
lubrication). Also,<b>in every case, wipe the excess oil off the chain.</b><br>

<br><br>

<h3>About Penatrant Cleaners/Lubricants: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory
,Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
 A <b>Penatrant</b> is a low viscosity fluid 
(about the consistency of water) primarily used as a<b>corrosion or rust 
destroyer, corrosion stopper, corrosion cleaner, dirt remover, wax remover, 
grime disolver, old oil remover, and general metal cleaner</b>. Penatrants can 
sometimes be used as a<b>short lasting lubricant</b> depending on its viscosity 
and the penatrant may be mixed with one or more added lubricants (usually in 
forms of light oil).<br>
<br>
<b>Warning;</b> Not a single penatrant can be 
used in a closed space nor around an open flame. Penatrants can be extremely 
volatile and/or explosive (like gasoline) or they can be less volatile (like 
kerosene) but still flammable and dangerous to use.<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Why is the Subject of Penatrant Lubrication Important:</b> Penatrant 
Lubricants are liquids (like gasoline) that have chemical properties that 
facilitate getting into very small nooks and crannies; penatrants can 
temporarily break-up or stop a corrosive or galvanic process and penatrants can 
temporarily act as a lubricant, but like water, penatrants are short lived. 
When penatrants are mixed with light weight oil, the penatrant can act as a 
clearing agent to introduce oil to a small nooks or cranny area (like the space 
between a chain roller and pin or between chain plates and rollers), but 
penatrants can keep oil from adhering to a chain roller, side plate, or pin.
</li> 
<li><b>Some Products with Penatrant Properties Are:</b> 
<ul> 
<li>Gasoline (very dangerous to use)</li> 
<li>White Gasoline (very dangerous to use)</li> 
<li>Naptha (very dangerous to use)</li> 
<li>Coleman Fuel (very dangerous to use)</li> 
<li>Carburetor Spray Cleaner</li> 
<li>Diesel</li> 
<li>Kerosene</li> 
<li>JP4 (Aviation Turbine Fuel - high grade diesel/kerosene; JP5 = JP4 + 
Antifreeze additive [also OK to use])</li> 
<li>Mineral Spirits (mineral only means that it came from the ground) aka 
White Spirit</li> 
<li>Mineral Oil</li> 
<li>Alcohol (very dangerous to use)</li> 
<li>Paint Thinner (Most Paint Thinners have Additives; Don't use a Paint 
Thinner with Additives).</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Some Mixed Penatrant and Oil Lubricant Products Are (light weight 
oil(s) and/or penatrant mixes): </b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>WD-40 (and its clones)</li> 
<li>Probably 3-In-1 Oil (cleans and lubricates bicycle chains - key word is 
'Clean')</li> 
<li>Some light Machine Oils (key word on the label is 'Clean')</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Does a Penatrant clear the way for further heavier Oil/Lubrication, or,
<br> Does a Penatrant repel heavier Oil/Lubrication?<br>
<br>
 The answer is 
YES!</b> The result is very conditional: 
<blockquote> The answer has to do with whether penatrants and multiple oil 
fluids keep their individual identities/properties or if the mixes of liquids 
meld their properties. The penatrant part of the mix will be the first compound 
to evaporate or disappear; penatrant evaporation is just a matter of time 
(usually 24 hours). Unfortunately, the typical touring cyclist usually does not 
have the time to wait around for a day or two. So the safest biker behavior for 
using a penatrant is to make sure that the penatrant is Evaporated/Removed 
before adding any further Lubrication. In a bike shop, the Techs/Mechs will 
typically use a high pressure air hose/nozzle to blow out or dry out a bike 
chain. At home some cyclists put their chain in an oven/stove (bake setting) 
and evaporate (by heat) remnant penatrant; some home cyclists have heat blowers 
(like a hand held hair dryer).1,3 In the field a cyclist will need to use 
evaporation and/or heat (sun hitting a chain in an open sandwich bag). In the 
field,<b>a smart touring cyclist will alternate between two chains</b>, thus 
allowing for penatrant evaporation (usually 24 hours), the use of two chains 
will slow down initial sprocket wear (front and back), it allows a cyclist to 
keep moving (versus waiting for a chain to dry), it removes the stress around 
chain care and management (did I wait long enough, will the oil/lube take 
hold), and, it is nice to have a backup chain for touring. Remember to oil the 
just cleaned chain on the following day.</blockquote></li> 
<li>Bike Shops usually use Compressed Air1,2 to expedite the drying process 
(no matter the type chain cleaning agent).</li> 
<li>Some bikers use heat guns1,3 (like what electricians use for shrink wrap, 
like a hand held hair dryer) to expedite the drying process. Some cyclists use 
their home oven/stove to Bake/evaporate the penatrant.</li> <br>
<br>
<b>
Caution:</b>Use protective gloves (heat proof, silicon, welder, or thick) for 
heat. In the field it is difficult to make the penatrant remnant evaporate in a 
timely manner; usually a chain needs to be exposed to a warm sun on a warm day 
to help evaporate penatrant remnant (place the chain in a clear plastic bag to 
enhance an oven effect).<br>
<b>Caution:</b> Lingering Penatrant on a chain may 
prevent oil from reaching necessary inner friction areas.<br>
<b>Warning 1:</b> 
Wipe all chains as well as one can before blowing, baking, drying, or 
lubricating (as well as for cleaning, the process reduces flammability, 
especially for any form of heat drying).<br>
<b>Warning 2:</b> Beware of what 
may be in a compressed air nozzle and beware of the background blow area. A 
lightly held object can be blown out of the hand or holder. Over spray can 
cause undesired effects or safety issues.<br>
<b>Warning 3:</b> Some hand held 
heat blowers can ignite flammable chain cleaning solvents/penatrants, be very 
careful, pre-wipe the chain of any free liquid with a clean rag, work in an 
open ventilated area free of any flammable materials and properly store all 
used rags and solvents. Some bike shops will not allow heat blowers inside 
their facility (an enclosure/ventilation issue).<br>
<b>Warning 4:</b> Always 
plan an escape route in case of flame (think drop and roll, where to go and 
where to not go). Always work where a fire will not burn anything else of value 
nor spread.<br>

<li>Polymers are added to oil lubricants to enhance lubrication capabilities.
</li> 
<li>Teflon does not attract dirt or grit and extends the life or usefulness of 
metal on metal friction.</li> 
<li>There do not seem to be any buildup or cleanup issues regarding Teflon use 
(certainly, not like wax).</li> </ol> THUS Teflon can extend the life of metal 
friction rubbing heating parts.</li> 
<li><b>Penatrants are NOT a Lubricant, But.</b> 
<ol> 
<li>List of Penatrant Types.</li> 
<li>Examples of Mixed/Combined Penatrant/Oil-Lubricants Products.</li> 
<li>Penatrants can be used for cleaning a chain.</li> 
<li>Penatrants dissipate or evaporate after a period of time (typically about 
24 hours unless heated and aired).</li> 
<li>Penatrants can help clear the way for proper (more viscous) oil 
lubrication to a chain.</li> 
<li>Penatrants can briefly serve as an emergency lubricant for a short period 
of time (typically about 2 to 4 hours).</li> 
<li>In most situations, just after a penatrant application to a chain, 
penatrants can prevent oil penetration AND repel an immediate oil application 
to the chain. Freshly applied penatrants can cause oil to fling off a moving 
bike chain.</li> 
<li>Use Nitrile or Latex like gloves for cleaning.</li> </ol> THUS Penatrants 
are problematic, certainly some penatrants are more dangerous too use AND 
penatrants may prevent more viscous oil lubricants from properly coating or 
adhering to metal parts. IF a penatrant is used for cleaning, then one may need 
to wait 24 hours before applying oil lubrication (dependable for a thorough 
metal part lube coating) OR one will need special penatrant 
dissipation/evaporation tools (like compressed air and/or a heated air nozzle).
</li> 
<li><b>The BEST Chain Lubrication process is complete emersion soaking in oil 
for a time that allows for full penetration to all chain part surface areas.</b>
 Sometimes chain flexing (or 'Exercise' expedites complete oil penetration). 
Heat and vibration shaking seem to expedite full surface area oil contact. Hot 
oil has safety issues. SeeBest Oil Lubrication Method (the previous section), 
as well as other oil lubrication methods.</li> </ol> 
<h3>Chain Related Touring Wisdom: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, 
Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
A touring cyclist should have and carry the 
appropriate replacement chain pins or master links for their bikes. Mountain 
Touring seems to have a higher percentage or likelihood of broken chains than 
road touring. A touring cyclist should have and carry spare chain link sections 
because when a chain breaks there is usually a damaged link plate or two. 
Therefore a half link or two may need to be removed and replaced as well as 
replacing the original broken link.<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> One needs a clean rag and oil because when a chain 
breaks, the chain is either on the ground or dragging on the ground.</li> 
<li><b>Experience/Caution:</b> Over time, many cyclists may have changed 
chains and chain manufacturers many times but may not have kept up with correct 
and matching chain segments, pins, or links (stored in the tool bag - 'out of 
sight, out of mind')</li> 
<li><b>Experience/Caution:</b> Over time many cyclists come to possess more 
than one bicycle and when they carry the same tools and/or tool kit on the 
various bikes, it becomes possible that one may be carrying the wrong links 
and/or pins (as well as wrong tubes) for the current ridden bike. Experienced 
riders need to be aware of this kind of situation.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> Make an effort to have spare/replacement links and/or 
pins, and chain segments for the chain that is actually on the bike.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> In emergency type situations, we have reused pins with 
success (just to get back to civilization and then address the chain issue).
</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> We have mixed chain links, we have used master links on 
other brand chains (even with a chain size difference), and we have mixed chain 
segments from different manufacturers, all with no issues for us and all chain 
issues were later addressed and corrected later at a bike shop.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> Some hand held heat blowers can ignite flammable chain 
cleaning solvents/penatrants, be very careful, pre-wipe the chain of any free 
liquid with a clean rag, work in an open ventilated area free of any flammable 
materials and properly store all used rags and solvents. Many bike shops will 
not allow heat blowers in their facility.</li> 
<li><b>BLOG Chain Feedback/Comments:</b> There is a sort of generalized 
movement among tour bike cyclists (mountain or road) and road bike cyclists 
(thus excluding BMX, track, fixies, and cruiser bikes) for changing chains to 
SRAM chains for the convenience of PowerLinks over Shimano Pin driven systems. 
Many Bloggers speak of ease of chain removal for cleaning, especially mountain 
bikers/tourers, on the other hand, there is a small contingency of riders 
(stump jumpers, trick riders, and city curb jumpers) that complain of 
PowerLinks breaking.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Chain Cleaning Methods and Issues (Between the Extremes) </h3> Top, 
Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Tour Survival - Chain Lubrication (Experience):</b> 
<ol> 
<li>First Choice, use any known bicycle oil (those sold in bike shops - Wax is 
OK in some cases and Teflon is always OK).</li> 
<li>Second use a product advertised as bicycle oil (but not a product that 
lists many uses and bicycle chain lubrication is one of the items on the list - 
those products probably belong in Item 5).</li> 
<li>Third, Chainsaw Bar and Chain Oil (in the USA it is always 30 Weight 
unless otherwise indicated; it has No Additives Nor Detergents; available in 
quart or gallon jug, must transfer into dependable delivery device, the 
transfer and delivery device are always problematic).</li> 
<li>Fourth, Automobile Engine Oil and synthetic automobile engine oil work 
just fine on bicycles. See - AboutAutomobile Oil Viscosity. Multi Weight is OK 
but will likely operate only at first Weight listing (left side).</li> 
<li>Transaxle/hipoid/hypoid/rear-differential 80/90 Wt oil (summer dessert), 
wheel bearing grease, two ounce tube of general purpose bicycle grease.</li> 
<li>Borderline Penatrants: Lubes like WD-40, 3-In-1 Oil, and light machine oil 
are usually good for 2-4 tour load hours (just re-apply when needed, at or just 
before the first sound of chain squeak).</li> 
<li>Finally, in the field, any lubrication is better than nothing. Cyclists 
have gotten by on vegetable oil, olive-oil, sun-screen, hand cream, Vaseline, 
mineral oil, and mineral spirits.</li> </ol> I have tens of thousands of 
touring miles away from home and I, myself, have been placed into situations 
where I have had to use sun-screen, motor oil, wheel bearing grease, and 
general purpose grease for chain lubrication and ended up having a good tour, a 
good time, and no regrets while pedaling out of an otherwise undesirable 
situation (with no known damage to the chain, but tour loaded chains only last 
half as long as regular road bike chains).</li> 
<li><b>Tour Survival - Chain Cleaning Methods:</b> Virtually any effort to 
clean and lube a chain (to include periodic wiping, if nothing else) will 
result in a longer lasting bicycle chain.
<ul> 
<li>A little <b>Coleman fuel</b> in a re-claimed jar with lid will clean a 
chain - Shake it! Repeat, till clean. Yes,<b>using White Gas or Naptha can be 
Dangerous</b> but is is a cleaning fluid that is on hand or sold in a camp 
store in a camp ground.</li> 
<li>Hand pedaling the chain through a <b>Diesel Fuel</b> soaked rag will work 
wonders toward cleaning a chain (works with<b>Mineral Oil and Kerosene</b> too).
</li> 
<li>Taking the chain off the bike and rag <b>scrubbing the chain</b> in a 
pie-tin or disposable plastic sandwich box or any open container will get a 
chain fairly clean. One may be amazed at what can be found on the roadside if 
one knows to look for clean rags and clean large mouth bottles (even big clean 
plastic coke bottles work just fine for shake clean methods - one may need to 
use a wire to retrieve a chain end).</li> 
<li>Water based cleaners like <b>Bio or Eco labeled Chain Cleaners solutions, 
Simple-Green, Orange Oil, or some Liquid Soaps will clean a chain in a jar or 
on the bike. Chain Degreaser Spray will also work</b> on the bike (repeat use, 
just like for bottle shake).<b>An advantage is that splatter on the bike can be 
washed off with a water bottle and rag. Also, this method has the least worries 
and least additional effort for properly disposing of dirty fluids, just wash 
the ground and put the rags into a trash container while enroute somewhere.</b>
</li> 
<li><b>Campgrounds and motels often offer rags upon request</b> (so people 
won't use hotel towels - very<i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i>) - this is 
particularly true to lodging facilities that support motorcycle clubs and/or 
snow mobile owners (common in the Northern and Western USA).</li> 
<li>Even spraying and rubbing a chain down with <b>WD-40</b> will get the 
chain pretty clean. It really helps to dry the chain when done (swing the chain 
clean in an open area and/or hand dry wipe it and/or it helps more if the 
mid-day hot sun can use direct sun light to heat and evaporate the<b>light 
weight cleaners, fuels, orpenatrants</b> consider setting the chain in a clean 
jar or plastic bag (a solar heater concept).</li> 
<li>Another old time remedy is to scrub a chain with a <b>toothbrush</b> or 
similar parts brush using any solution cleaner or penatrant or even oil (to 
include auto oil) - replenish dirty solution with clean solution as you go. Use 
discarded bottles on the road side to hold discarded waste and dispose of as 
properly as one can - We've carried trash (and dirty rags and used dirty fluid 
for a day or two) for proper disposal.</li> 
<li><b>Clean oil can be used to clean a chain</b> and the biggest benefit from 
that process is that one does not have to re-lube the chain once the chain is 
sufficiently clean, it's already lubed! Recycling dirty oil is the easiest 
liquid to recycle (not counting water).</li> 
<li>Some people have used <b>Exterior Engine Oil Degreaser</b> (both with 
water or by rag wipe), in both cases it is a case of something is better than 
nothing but it is not the best long run cleaning method over time.</li> 
<li>If one is on tour and runs the bike through a hand held <b>car wash</b> 
system, using degreaser and then wet rinse clean, followed by hands on rag 
drying followed by a proper chain oil/lube job, then one can use a car wash; 
one needs to know what one is doing. Motor cycle chain degreaser and foam 
degreaser work with the same knowledge caveat. One of the caveats about using 
car washes is that accidently spraying the crank and hub bearing areas can 
create another problem (water in the bearings), a much more expensive issue to 
address whether it's the cost of your time and/or your money.</li> 
<li>One Chain Cleaning method is to use a flat low profile pan/lid like a <b>
cookie tin lid or the tin itself</b> (or a Frisbee or a solid pie tin - The 
original Frisbee Company made commercial pie tins).</li> 
<li>A commercial product that is a combined <b>Chain and Tooth Brush</b> (as 
in sprocket teeth, not human teeth) remains the best cleaning tool - Yes it is 
worth carrying on a tour!</li> 
<li><b>Towels and rags</b> are necessary for several chain wiping iterations.
</li> 
<li>Use a <b>jar or empty oil can to capture dirty oil or cleaner</b>. It is 
dirty work, no way around it, wear gloves.</li> 
<li><b>Properly dispose of all used cleaning components.</b></li> 
<li>Before re-mounting the chain, <b>insure that the sprockets have been 
cleaned</b> - the Sprocket Tooth Brush works best. This process is always 
messier. The rear<b>cassette is best cleaned with the wheel off the bike</b>. 
The front crank rings are best cleaned with the crank arm and rings removed 
from the bike (most upper line bikes allow this, but not all). Very often the 
only way to reach deep is with a plastic knife (eating wear knife or a<b>deep 
reach bicycle serrated blade</b> of about 1/4 inch or 1 cm gapped and spaced 
triangle shaped teeth).</li> 
<li>Don't forget to <b>clean the pulleys</b> but try not to get cleaning fluid 
in the pulley bearing area, seeDerailer Pulleys (aka Jockey Wheels) for 
cleaning and lubing issues.</li> 
<li>When reconnecting a chain (if removed from the bike for cleaning): Place 
the bike gear derailer settings to the smallest rings, get achain holder (I use 
a<b>thin coat hanger in a C shape</b> - it can be used to hook the chain to a 
frame component or to hook the chain end to end). Initially wrap the chain 
around the smallest rear sprocket and around the front crank housing (bottom 
bracket). Use the chain holder and then thread the chain through the derailer 
cages (be careful on the rear derailer pulleys, as it is easy to thread in an 
improper direction) and then pin or link the chain together. Be careful not to 
drop or drag the chain on the ground.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Regarding Automobile Oil Use and Oil Viscosity</b>: First of all, there 
is nothing wrong with using auto oil on bicycle chains, however automotive oil 
was engineered for a closed system (bike chains are open systems) and 
automotive oil was engineered for a much hotter operating environment (chains 
operate at the environmental temperature). Cyclists seem to understand 
Viscosity being presented as a SAE 'Weight', 50 Weight is thicker than 30 
Weight, 30 Weight is thicker than 10 Weight; one will not see the word Weight 
on SAE lubricants, they will see SAE 30 (other fuel/lubricant standards 
organizations exist, they are generally just as consistent in their 
presentation), However the 'W' in the term 20W-30 has a different meaning, 'W' 
means Winter and this means that the cold viscosity measure is 20 Weight but as 
the motorized engine warms up, the oil will thicken and take on the behavior of 
a 30 Weight oil (in this example) - this increase of oil viscosity is achieved 
through the use of added Polymers (polymers are like chemical springs that 
expand as they get warmer, thus causing the fluid properties to chemically 
thicken or become more viscous). Cyclists will not likely operate in an 
environment where 20 Weight oil of a 20W-30 oil application will convert to 30 
Weight oil properties.</li> 
<li><b>Subjective Opinion About Using Automobile Oil (from Cyclist Information 
Sharing):</b> Why consider auto oil to lubricate a bicycle chain? Because auto 
oil is cheaper and just as effective (bike oil at the price per gallon is 
reaching $30-40/gallon when one adds up all those 4 ounce bottles at $3-4 per 
each) and bicycle chains still need to be cleaned at about the same usage 
cycle. What about Polymers? Cyclists don't get much benefit from using 
Polymers. Auto oil with polymers was designed to operate in a closed 
environment, the jury is still open on polymer effectiveness in an open bicycle 
chain system - I've heard nothing negative (by people who actually use 
automobile oil). In fact the only issue that one hears about is the subject of 
Oil Detergents, that is, chemicals added to oil designed to clean carbon from 
cylinder walls and prevent grime or scorching buildup in the bearing/friction 
contact areas. I have to ask, what is wrong with that? Absolutely nothing. Does 
it cause more wear on the bike chain rollers? Yes, but the bicycle chain roller 
bearing wear probably is not more than what is caused by cleaning with a tooth 
brush. See the next bullet.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A problem with 
using auto oil is placing a usable quantity of oil into some kind of delivery 
container. It's difficult finding something that does not leak. I've re-used 
oil drip bottles and I've used oil soaked rags with OK success (spinning pedals 
through the gears to evenly distribute the oil). Even quart sized bottles leak 
once they are opened; gallon sized plastic zipper bags can handle many oil 
bottle sizes (but not all). Store low, just like with water purifier 
Chlorine/Clorox.</li> 
<li><b>Bicycle Chain Characteristics</b>: In general, bicycle chains do not 
heat up from cycling use (not like an automobile engine) but bicycle chains DO 
reflect the temperature of the environment. In USA Temperate Climates, the best 
spring, summer, and fall seasonal oils seem to be 30 Weight (SAE viscosity 
measure) - same as recommended by Sheldon Brown. During the winter, 30 Weight 
oil may become so viscous (thick) that it can't be easily applied or removed 
unless taken into a warm environment - Plenty of cyclists ride their bikes in 
the winter. During the winter season (or in cold climates), wax in an oil 
solution can solidify so hard that it will not come out an oil bottle spout - 
See Picture). The 20, 10, and 5 Weight Oils are proportionately more suitable 
to progressively colder climates. During the summer in dessert/very-hot 
climates, some long range cyclists use transaxle oil (hypoid gear oil - 80/90 
Weight). There is always a balancing act between using oil that sticks to the 
chain and being sticky enough to retain dirt (why wax was introduced to summer 
oil applications). The last caveat is that if one is going to tour for 3 to 6 
months (for example, conducting a cross continent tour and carrying a tour 
load), that cycling activity will wear out one chain and probably wear out two 
chains - it is wisest to alternate chains in this case and definitely wise to 
carry a backup chain.It seems strange to worry about detergent effects or even 
the corrosive effects of a bio-friendly chain cleaner rinsed by water for a 
chain whose life is 3-6 months.</li> </ul> <b>Bicycle Chain Cleaning Methods 
(Extreme Most Efficient and Extreme Most Effective)</b><b>: </b><br>
(Other 
more practical Chain Cleaning Methods are listed underTouring Methods)<br>

<ol> 
<li><b>The MOST EFFICIENT Bicycle Chain Cleaning system uses a liquid 
penatrant mixed along with vigorous physical brushing and ultrasonic chain 
vibration/shaking</b> (chain off the bike).</li> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> All Penatrants are flammable and dangerous; some are more 
explosive than others</li> 
<li><b>Diesel and Kerosene are the safer to use products of the listed 
Penatrant Products.</b></li> 
<li>This is not an approval for using explosive fuels, but the products in the 
Class of Penatrants are currently the most efficient cleaning liquids 
(efficient: shortest amount of time to get the job done well).</li> 
<li>The chain cleaning process requires time to remove the penatrant 
physically or to allow proper evaporation. The penatrant evaporation process 
can be expedited by an air hose blowing but in order to be thorough; otherwise 
it takes time for the penatrant to evaporate. In the field, one can swing the 
chain (remove loose pieces first, wink) and one can lay out the chain in direct 
midday hot sunlight. In the field, one can hand dry with a rag/towel as much as 
possible.</li> 
<li>The best field practice is to alternate between two chains, thus the new 
spare chain can have time to let the penatrant evaporate (24 hrs).</li> 
<li>The best cleaning system uses a clean solution (for each cleaning 
cycle/iteration). It is not unusual to need four cleaning cycles. This process 
is expensive and time consuming but it is the most efficient bicycle chain 
cleaning method. Be sure to properly dispose of remnant cleaner.</li> 
<li>An ultrasonic vibrator is best BUT hand shaking, especially in a bottle 
like container is very effective and clean empty bottles with a little liquid 
penatrant like diesel or mineral spirits can be very efficient and effective on 
the trail side.</li> 
<li>A dedicated cleaning tooth brush is a perfect tool for hand cleaning grit. 
Wear gloves (Latex, Nitrile, ...), otherwise the stain will last two-three days 
on the hand.</li> 
<li>Be sure to wipe a clean chain with a rag as well as possible to rid it of 
any loose or lingering penatrant fluid.</li> 
<li>Heat can be used for the evaporation process (like direct heat of the day 
sunlight exposure, which can be time consuming) or a heater/blower device may 
be used in a shop (again safety is a huge issue); some home cyclists use blow 
dryers (with heat resistant gloves) or some cyclists bake their chain in an 
oven (to heat evaporate the remnant penatrant).</li> </ol> THUS, the MOST 
EFFICIENT Bicycle Chain Cleaning solution may not be the safest, it is the most 
impractical field solution (air hose and heat drying), and it is difficult to 
properly dispose of dirty and flammable penatrant liquid (versus recycling oil 
- much easier to do, see next).
<li><b>The MOST EFFECTIVE Bicycle Chain Cleaning System is to use Oil as a 
Cleaner:</b><br>
<i>Sheldon Brown uses this same argument with less elaboration.
</i></li> 
<ol> 
<li>Gasoline (a penatrant) can be dangerous to use, Water and Water Soluble 
Products leave water remnants (rust) or cleaning product (corrosion) hidden in 
the bicycle chain's friction areas (nooks and crannies), and Wax is not a 
Lubricant and can cause problems in the long run (dry metal to metal rub and 
dam further oil penetration).Note that other liquid penatrants exist, like 
diesel fuel, mineral oil, mineral spirits and others; other penatrants may not 
be as explosive as gasoline but are still more flammable than oil. SeePenatrants
. </li> 
<li>One issue with using oil for cleaning is removing dirty oil, proper/safe 
disposal of the oil, and how to clean oneself or keep oneself from getting 
dirty. Soap and water works great for cleaning one's self but dirty grimy 
greasy stains on the hands, arms, or face may last for days and stains on 
clothing may be permanent in the field but take much effort to remove at home. 
Clean rags work great for removing excess clean oil and for removing dirty grit 
on the chain. The use of disposable gloves (Latex, Nitrile, ...) helps greatly 
to keep one's self clean.</li> 
<li>So far, the monetary costs of using oil to clean oil are the same or less 
expensive than using other bicycle chain cleaning products and/or using bicycle 
chain oil to clean a bike chain.</li> 
<li>Another issue for using any bicycle chain cleaning product is safety of 
use. Does the cleaner have any carcinogen properties or any negative 
environmental properties? While unprocessed oil comes from the ground/earth, 
returning processed oil to the earth is bad for drinking water and water 
tables. However, more so than for any other cleaning agent, there are more oil 
recycling centers than for any other cleaning liquid (not counting sewage and 
water treatment plants).</li> 
<li><b>Many auto parts stores and many specialty lube shops conduct oil 
recycling.</b> Arrange to visit one of these locations while pedaling through a 
town or while in a campground at a town's edge.</li> 
<li>Sheldon Brown recommends using Chainsaw and Bar Oil, a good 
recommendation, but it is important to understand the reasoning. Chainsaw and 
Bar Oil is usually 30 Weight oil with No Additives and NO Detergents, it's just 
pure oil. It's the lack of additives and detergents that is important to 
Sheldon; however it is not a problem to use automobile oil (SAE 30 Wt or even 
other Oil Viscosities/Weights), read on. In lieu of pure 30 Weight oil, then 
auto oil is a perfectly fine substitute, both for cleaning as well as for 
bicycle chain lubrication. In addition, I would add this caveat: I would 
consider heavier weight lubrication for really hot climates (just like for 
automobiles) and I would consider lighter weight lubrication for cold climate 
riding (I ride in the winter in Colorado and this is a real issue and 
solution). Meanwhile, back to the cleaning subject, I find that lighter weight 
oils are effective for cleaning.</li> 
<li>Handling dirty oil can be messy and may take a few cleaning iterations. 
Use oil sparingly and recycle dirty oil. Use a Combination Tooth-Brush Tool for 
the actual scrubbing of a chain (use the Chain Brush for scrubbing exterior 
plates and rollers, and use the Sprocket Tooth Brush for the interior plates 
and rollers). Oil can be filtered at home but there are few applications for 
home filtered oil - If you have an application, by all means use it (and let me 
know about it). In the field, one should take dirty oil to an oil recycling 
location - it can't be burned off like dirty Coleman Fuel or dirty Diesel Fuel).
</li> </ol> THUS pure 30 Wight oil is generally the best cleaning oil as well 
as generally the best final lubrication oil, although it is perfectly logical 
to initially use lighter weight oil (like 5 Wt or 5-20 Wt) for cleaning. Also, 
it is perfectly OK to use bicycle oil for cleaning, but that process is very 
expensive. Used dirty oil is easier to recycle than any other kind of cleaning 
agent - much of the used oil will be in a towel/rag. On the road, a cookie tin 
lid (shape, open plastic sandwich box, or Frisbee) is the best cleaning 
container and a combination Tooth and Sprocket Brush remains the best tool 
(human tooth brush and cotton swabs are second best). Properly dispose of all 
used cleaning supplies (wipe brush tool and use it again).</ol> 
<h3>How to Re-Attach a Broken Chain (for a derailer Bicycle): </h3> Top, 
Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
<b>Caution:</b> One 
must carefully use any chain tool as ALL LINK SEGMENTS SIT LOOSE and DO NOT 
PROPERLY SIT or ALIGN with the chain tool's Link-Pin Driver. The cyclist must 
make mental and physical effort to hold the pin and link plates centered on the 
outer tool cradle (the far cradle) with one set of fingers while carefully 
operating the twist-in Pin-Screw with the other set of fingers, all while 
keeping all object parts perfectly centered.<br>
<br>
<b>Caution:</b> There are 
a few specialized drive train systems that require the use of specialized 
tools. The same systems usually require steps beyond what is presented herein. 
One such system is the Campagnolo 11 speed chain drive system which requires 
their $200 11 speed chain tool and chain pin finishing (like trimming and 
peening a rivet) - Campy's warranty is voided without the use of their tool.<br>
<br> <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Make sure that all the parts are wiped clean. No visible oil on the plates 
to be worked upon and No dirt (one may re-lube the chain after it is connected, 
if necessary).</li> 
<li>If adding a chain segment (to replace the broken or removed chain 
segment), add to one end of the chain, now. Try to keep/maintain character 
alignment.</li> 
<li>Get/Have/Obtain a 'Chain Holder'. Have it handy. In lieu of having a Chain 
Holder, one may use a re-usable zip tie, string, wire tie, or a volunteer to 
hold the chain ends together (to keep the chain off of the ground and from a 
free run).</li> 
<li>If the chain side plates have numerals or characters, many technicians try 
to lay out the chain so the characters can be read while the chain is on the 
top of the run between the sprockets. There are a few top-of-the-line drive 
train systems (cranks, cassettes, derailers, and chains) that are directional 
and have special instructions for chain mounting, link placement and link 
segment placement - owners of those bike systems will probably know about their 
bike's special requirements.</li> 
<li><b>In the field:</b> Before threading the chain, set the shifters for the 
large sprockets (so as to use the most chain length, thus helping to keep the 
chain off the ground).</li> 
<li>Make sure that the loose chain is properly weaved through the jockey 
wheels (aka pulleys) and derailer cages.</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>In a stand:</b> Wrap the chain around any rear sprocket in line with 
the derailer, run the chain through the front cage but drape it over the front 
bottom bracket (from Cat). This leaves lots of slack. Use aChain Holder (or 
similar device) to hold the chains together, 1 to 2 inches in from each chain 
end (thus allowing easier access to the open end pieces)</li> 
<li><b>In the field:</b> Slack is the enemy and dangling chains get dirty, 
quickly. Before re-chaining, insure that the shifters are set for the large 
sprockets. If available, get a hand from another person, to hold a pedal or 
chain in place (to keep the chain from free running to the ground). Use a Chain 
Holder to hold together chain pins 1 to 2 inches in from each chain end (thus 
keeping loose ends out of the dirt and allowing easier access to the open end 
pieces).</li> </ul> 
<li>Make the Connection: Either, use the chain tool to drive in the connecting 
pin, or use a master link (PowerLink sample follows).</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> Pin insertion is performed as a dry press (Do NOT lube the 
pin).</li> 
<li>If using the chain tool, use the farthest cradle and only drive in the 
center press when all elements are centered and aligned properly. Twist the 
lever clockwise, take your time, and 'Mind the Relatives'.</li> 
<li><b>How far do I push the Pin?</b> - Make the far protrusion of the pin 
look that same as the other factory set pins. Sometimes people can feel the 
outer plates settle in between the pin ridges.</li> 
<li>Break off the Pin's Pilot piece. Some Chain Tools have little holes in the 
tool to insert the pilot to hold it and then the tool can be rotated against a 
firmly held chain and pin and the pilot will snap apart cleanly (the pin is 
pre-grooved for a stress snap) or one can use a pair of pliers.</li> 
<li>If faced with a choice of having the pin be positioned properly in the 
near chain plate or the far chain plate, position the pin for the far chain 
plate and then move the chain to the front cradle and push in (re-position) the 
pin on just the front plate. This is a similar method as used for un-bindingA 
Kinked Chain (which is addressed in a following section).</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> If the far side pin position is set correctly in the outer 
plate and the near side of the pin is inside the main chain unit, then the pin 
is too short, IT CANNOT BE USED. Get a correct sized pin.<br>
<b>In the Field:
</b> If the replacement pin is too short, and no other correct replacement pin 
is available, consider using a master link or reusing a removed pin/rivet (to 
get out of a desperate situation). Correct this situation as soon as one can

<h3>In the Field: Ways to Clean and Lube Bicycle Chains </h3> Top, Mechanical 
Issues Directory, Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br>
 ANY reasonable effort to 
periodically clean and lubricate a bicycle chain will go a long ways toward 
getting the most tour life out of a chain. Touring is hard on chains; bike 
loads usually cut a chains life in half, especially if pulling a trailer or 
running on a tandem.
<ul> 
<li><b>Field - Periodic Wipes</b>: 
<ul> 
<li><i>For touring</i>, the Periodic Wipe Issue is that it is usually the 
accumulated dirt that needs to be removed and it is the dirt that causes chain, 
sprocket, and crank ring wear.</li> 
<li><b>Best Practice:</b> Wipe the chain once a day. Chain wipes go a long way 
towards chain longevity.</li> 
<li>Always wipe a chain after running through mud, water, snow, ice, or rain. 
Also wipe clean just before oiling the chain.</li> 
<li>The chain does not need to be lubed every time that it is wiped clean.</li>
<li>In terms of chain lube or longevity, a chain can last a few days without 
needing to be re-lubricated. Chains with tour loads can usually go 100 miles 
(150 kilometers) between re-oiling (with good weather and roads).</li> 
<li>If one has a tandem or recumbent, then one needs more disposable rags.</li>
<li><b>Hint:</b> The good news / bad news story is that most cyclists will 
bike by a clean piece of cloth (lost, serviceable, trash) on the ground or 
road-side, almost daily. Learn to recognize these as free rags for your use; 
usually one good shake will get the dust off, save for chain maintenance. Don't 
pick up dirty, grimy, rotten cloth (except to throw it away).</li> 
<li>Most Motels and Campgrounds will give anyone, upon polite request, rags 
that can be used for maintenance.</li> 
<li>Dispose of dirty rags properly (we usually get about five days use out of 
a rag and we store the interim rag in a sealable plastic bag).</li> 
<li>Wipe the sprockets and cranks too - they don't need to be lubed if a fresh 
lubed chain is run through the different gear ring combinations.</li> </ul><br>

</li> 
<li><b>Field - Chain Cleaning - Clean Coke Bottle Method</b>: 
<ul> 
<li><i>For touring</i>, obtain a clean and dry plastic or glass bottle with a 
lid/cap (often found on the road-side and sometimes in rubbish bins), get two 
bottles if possible (one for clean fluid, one for dirty fluid) - 12 ounces to 2 
liter clear containers will work nicely, bigger is better; typical found on 
road side bottles are juice or soda bottle, clean as needed; wide mouth lids 
are better; fill with biodegradable cleaner (like orange oil) or in a pinch 
(kerosene or diesel fuel, which have low flash points compared to gasoline).
</li> 
<li>We have seen people use Coleman Fuel from/for their camp stoves - this can 
be Dangerous. Coleman Fuel is a commonly carried camp stove fuel for bike 
touring and it is readily available at camp grounds, either to buy, borrow, or 
leave extra fuel with another camper.</li> 
<li>Fill only about an inch deep; drop in the chain; cap it (or cup it); shake 
it (Shake, Don't Stir.<i>~ Ian Fleming.</i>), pour dirty fluid into second 
container, repeat as needed; pull out the chain; if orange oil or liquid soap 
used, wash it; wipe it as dry as is reasonable then let it dry (sun it, swing 
it, - be careful, any combination); when dry, oil it (per the next segment).
</li> 
<li>The nice thing about water soluble cleaning agents is that it is a Green 
practice that makes field work easier (don't have to worry about dirty fluid 
disposal) and one can use water bottles and if there is splatter on the bike, 
the degreaser/cleaner can often be used on the bike frame or gear components.
</li> 
<li>If the container has a small cap, then a wire or coat hanger may be needed 
for fetching the chain.</li> 
<li>Dispose of used fluids and rags properly. Sometimes, especially in a 
group, two or three cyclist chains may be cleaned in combination or in back to 
back processes.</li> 
<li>It is extremely convenient to have a brush handy, be it a human tooth 
brush or a sprocket tooth brush.</li> 
<li>It takes about 24 hours for a Penatrant to evaporate on its own. Hand 
wiping a chain dry helps a lot. Drying a chain in the sun in a plastic bag can 
accelerate drying time to 2-4 hours. That can be a lot of down time for a 
touring bike, but is OK if the riders are in a museum or such.</li> 
<li><b>Best Practice:</b> Carry a second chain and alternate chains, about 
weekly or as a result of poor riding conditions like rain or mud. Thus, one has 
a backup chain and one avoids the issues associated with penatrant drying and 
the (as much as) 24 hour waiting time. Remember toZ Pattern lube the chain on 
the following day (discussed in the next section).</li> 
<li>There is some wisdom in alternating chains, the action can even out chain 
and sprocket wear, extend the life of sprockets (front and rear), and address 
the clean chain penatrant evaporation wait issue.</li> 
<li>Check for chain kinks. It is easier to find kinks by performing a slow 
roll of the chain while on the bike. The best place to catch kinks is right at 
the point of rolling off of theTension Pulley. Loosen any Chain Kinks as soon 
as they are discovered.</li> 
<li>Check for protruding chain pins or rivets. This inspection is best 
performed with the chain off the bike. Sometimes a pin or rivet sticks out a 
little more than the other pins or rivets. Sometimes one side of the pin/rivet 
is out too far and the other side is in too far.Re-set any pins or rivets that 
stick out too far (pins or rivets rub on sprockets and sometimes the derailer 
cage). In extreme cases, a pin/rivet rub will wear out the outer pin grip on 
the outer chain plate wall and the chain will come apart (usually on a big 
climb).</li> 
<li>Many other bicycle Chain Cleaning methods exist.</li> </ul><br>
</li> 
<li><b>Field - Chain Lubrication and Application Method</b>: 
<ul> 
<li><i>For touring</i>, Bicycle Oil (small bottle) is the most common 
lubricant. It is the cyclist's preference for No-Additives, Wax, Teflon, Other 
Additives, or Engine Oil. SeeChain Lubrication Issues for benefits.</li> 
<li>Oil Viscosity is situational (Season, Location, Moisture Exposure, and 
Particulate Exposure).</li> 
<li>Any lube is better than no lube.</li> 
<li>It is important to have a good lubrication delivery container, preferably 
with a straw (cut down to 1.5 inches or 5 cm's, tape extra to the container).
</li> 
<li><b>Best Practice:</b> The Z Pattern lube application method is 
particularly effective and smart to do after a really good chain cleaning - 
this is the time to be sure to spin/run the lubed chain over every sprocket 
(front and back).</li> 
<li>Other Lubrication Methods exist.</li> 
<li>For routine lubrication (not after super cleaning the chain, but after a 
wipe down), use the 'Hold the Bottle Stem/Tube Still Method' over the rollers 
as one spins the chain, Or one can 'Move the Bottle Over a Still Chain' (this 
is done in segments as one rotates the chain the length of one oil run, repeat 
till done).</li> 
<li><b>Hint:</b> We use a Power Link for a Lube start and end point on the 
chain; sometimes we mark a link with a permanent and oil proof marker (which 
seems to last about a month); some people paint a link.</li> 
<li>Be sure to wipe the excess lubricant from the chain and sprockets, as 
needed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<h3>Bicycle Touring Chain Survival/Usage Issues: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues 
Directory, Chain Sub-Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Most chain breaks are caused by the bike being in the wrong rings for the 
current requirements. For<b>experienced bikers</b>, this usually results from 
unscheduled/unplanned stops, typically to take a picture, look at a view, or 
join a friend who stopped (for any reason). Then, when a biker starts pedaling 
s/he starts shifting (often many sprocket/cassette rings) and applies too much 
torque pressure at the same time; thus breaking a chain. In order to not break 
a chain, it is often best to push-walk the bike and manually shift (usually 
down) to a manageable drive sprocket position. [By the Way, the obvious<b>Rookie
</b> place to break a chain is downshifting a lot while climbing a hill - Hint, 
down shift a lot before the hill.]</li> 
<li>We seem to break one chain, once, every other year. In every case of chain 
break, we were on mountain or steep hill trails where we were performing a 
burst of shifting in brief periods of time (carrying touring loads).</li> 
<li>Chains on bikes with trailers wear out twice as fast. Incorporate chain 
maintenance/replacement into long tour planning and/or a complete spare chain; 
in fact, there is some wisdom in alternating chains (even out chain and 
sprocket wear; allow penatrant evaporation).</li> 
<li>There is an interim period where, if a chain is replaced for wear then no 
major drive train damage will occur, or else the sprockets wear considerably 
more than normal and new sprockets will be required (front and back) at a 
increased time and money cost. Stay up to date on chain maintenance and 
replacement.</li> 
<li>Chain links, link pins, and master or connector links are not universal. 
What bikers forget is that when they replace a chain, if the chain is a 
different type or from a different manufacturer, then the old emergency links 
or master link or chain pin may not be appropriate for the new chain (also, new 
bike warranty can be at stake).</li> 
<li>Generally, <b>Shimano Chains use replacement Chain-Pins</b> to connect 
replacement chain segments or a broken chain and<b>SRAM Chains use (modern) 
Master-Links</b> (called Power-Links) to connect replacement chain segments or 
a broken chain. Both Shimano and SRAM have different links or pins for 
differing chain types (7/8-9-10 cassette sprockets) and/or chain grades. X/Y 
chain terminology, like 7/8, means that one chain exists, now, to serve the 
needs of a 7 sprocket rear cassette or an 8 sprocket rear cassette. Save the 
Instructions, See next note.</li> 
<li>Chain Part/Tool/Support needs are very chain specific for 10 or 11 speed 
chains. However, in a pinch<b>in-the-field, it seems that 7, 8, and 9 
cassette-ring chain link pins and master link chain links are interchangeable
</b> (not so for 10 or 11 cassette-ring chains).</li> 
<li>We have marked the master link (or a randomly selected link on a pin 
system) with red or white waterproof and oil proof paint/marker so as to aid in 
chain lubrication so that we have a known start and end point. Also, marking a 
master link helps to find it faster for maintenance or repairs. Some master 
links are a different color from the chain and do not need marking.</li> 
<li>Carry Spare/Replacement Links and/or Master Links</li> 
<li><b>Caution/Lesson/Experience:</b> SRAM Quick Links and Power Links are 
only supposed to be used once (by their own documentation). Can the links be 
used more than once? Usually the answer is Yes. What is the actual issue? The 
links are not designed to be opened and closed at will and the links may 
eventually fail to hold a chain AND when a chain link fails, it is almost 
always on a hill at the farthest point from any help.<br>
<b>Lesson:</b> We had 
a main drive chain on a tandem break open on a major hill climb. Dennis had 
re-used a Quick Link maybe 6-8 times (guessing). The link's ability to hold 
together under pressure just wore out. Dennis had a warning while performing a 
shifting adjustment on the same bike on a bike stand just a day prior - The 
Quick Link just opened up and dropped the main chain while performing a pedal 
spin to test a cage/shift adjustment.<b>SO, if a quick link ever comes apart, 
no matter the condition, replace it with a new link. AND, while one may 
consider re-using a Quick Link, One should replace it no matter what after four 
uses AND one should always carry a brand-new spare Quick Link</b> along with 
the usual spare links and chain tool.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> There has been many a time when we were very remote and 
have removed one full link from a broken chain, re-used the same pin, and 
finished the tour. Remember that a link includes one outer plate and one inner 
plate.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> We also carry a Chain Holder in order to hold the chain 
together while performing a chain repair.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> From Cat (of BBI), when reconnecting a busted chain (or 
new chain of proper length), lay the chain across the crank housing (not the 
crank sprocket), thus giving more slack to better manage and control the chain. 
Note that there are times in the field where this may give too much slack and 
allow the chain end to swing into the dirt/ground.</li> 
<li><b>When Travel Survival Matters</b>, it is better to push a bike for 10 
feet now, to coax the shifter &amp; chain into the correct sprocket ring, 
rather than to push the bike for 10 miles, a minute from now, with a broken 
chain.</li> 
<li><b>The Id and the Odyssey</b> - Sometimes the ego gets in the way. 
Learn/Teach to down shift while standing beside the bike for stops made without 
downshifting beforehand - #1 cause of broken chains for experienced riders and 
#1 cause of thrown chains</li> 
<li>The Rear/Drive Chain of Tandem Bicycles wears at almost double the rate of 
the remaining chains.</li> 
<li><b>All Bicycle Touring Riders</b> should know how to repair an inner tube 
flat and know how to repair a broken chain (with a pin and/or a master link). 
In lieu of knowing how, at least ride in a group with someone who does know how.
</li> </ul> 
<h4>Major Field Repair Issues:</h4> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Chain 
Sub-Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> In the field, a cyclist may be forced to reuse a rivet/pin 
that was not designed to be reused. Remember that field repairs, in this case, 
are just to get a cyclist out of a remote area and into a bicycle shop for a 
proper repair or replacement.<i>Ergo,</i> it is wise to have spare links, pins 
or master links (as is appropriate) and know how to install them.<i>BUT, see 
next bullet ...</i><br>
<b>Experience:</b> We have reused link pins and 
experienced no travel problems. In every case we were a few miles to hundreds 
of miles from any known help or solution. We had no choice and the fix worked 
for us (and some others).</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> While undesired, it is common that a cyclist may not have 
spare links and will be forced to ride with one or two missing links from the 
chain's original length.<i>See next bullet ...</i></li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> When operating with missing chain links (and we have), a 
cyclist must avoid cross chaining on the largest cogs/rings as it can stretch, 
bend, damage, or destroy the rear derailer (especially the pulley cage) because 
the chain is shorter than the system was designed to manage. When a derailer is 
damaged, the result is that the cyclist may have to push their bike and/or ride 
their bike as a fixed single speed bike.Emergency Single Speed Derailer Set Up
</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> It is common that before re-connecting a broken chain, a 
half link (one set of plates) with one or two bent/twisted/damaged chain 
plate(s) will have to be removed. Damaged plate removal prevents other 
components from further degradation (like pulleys, sprocket/ring teeth, or the 
derailer itself).</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Replacement Chain Pins can only connect inner and outer 
plates (NOT two inner plates and NOT two outer plates) which is why a perfectly 
good half link may have to be removed (in order to reconnect a chain). Master 
Links always go between a pair of inner plate sets and a perfectly good outer 
plate link on the end of a chain may need to be removed (in order to reconnect 
a chain by its inner plates on the chain's end).</li> </ul><br>

 Chain Noise and/or Cage Rub 
Sounding Noise Issues:</h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Noise 
Symptom/Solution Sub-Directory<br>
Derailer Cable Tension Adjustment Noise <br>

<br> 
<ul> <b><i>Issue:</i></b> Just as the chain wears over time so does the front 
crank rings and the rear cassette/sprockets. There is nothing more symptomatic 
than a brand new chain on a worn sprocket to bring out the noise effect of a 
worn sprocket but it can just happen over time.<b>The noise can be a result of 
one or more of two physical conditions</b>: 
<ol> 
<li>The <b>chain teeth get worn</b>, thus allowing for a chain slip sound that 
can sound like a cage rub.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> This is a safety issue with the smaller sprockets (less 
than 21 teeth) as chain slip may occur and performance may be lost at a key 
moment of pedal pressure.</li> 
<li>The sprocket <b>tooth pitch changes</b>, over time, as a chain wears the 
teeth climb and descent curve angles asymmetrically. This occurs to all 
sprockets but some get worn out sooner than others (the ones with the most 
rotation/use action).</li> 
<li>A worn sprocket may create a sort of <b>repelling action</b> to a chain 
with a different pitch (usually a new chain on an old sprocket ring but it can 
be an old chain on a new sprocket).</li> </ol> When the chain rotates around 
the sprocket, because of the<b>mismatch between chain pitch and tooth pitch</b> 
(the standard is 1/2 inch precisely and a worn chain's pitch is greater by 
fractions of an inch) eventually the pitch mating differences causes a 
grinding/wearing type of noise that sounds like a chain-basket rub (metal on 
metal), much like the noise caused by an out of trim/index derailer.<br>
<br>

<b><i>Noise/Sound:</i></b> <b>It is extremely tough to discriminate the 
different kinds and sources of noise that more or less come from the same area
</b> (shift trim rub, basket-chain rub, chain/next-cassette rub, sprocket wear 
or sprocket-chain pitch mismatch wear - See the bottom links/references) 
because the noise that these all of these activity areas create comes from the 
same general area and sprocket wear noise is far less common than trim or cage 
rub noises. Most people cannot tell the difference by sound (including<i>moi</i>
).
<ul> 
<li>In a shop, a sprocket can be tested with a <b>Sprocket Wear Indicator Tool
</b> (Rholoff has one for about $50 USD [in 2010] - other manufacturers exist, 
most others are less costly).</li> 
<li>In the field, <b>a clue</b> that it is a sprocket and not a basket rub is 
that the shifting seems to operate perfectly at rest on a 
stand/bipod-kickstand/while-lifted, during inspection, but one will still 
mysteriously experience noise while riding that yet sounds like a cage-chain 
rub (especially riding uphill!).<i>One generally suspects a bad derailer before 
suspecting sprocket wear.</i></li> 
<li>In the field, <b>a clue</b> is noise with a brand new chain on old 
sprockets when everything was more or less operating quietly before the new 
chain.</li> </ul> <br>
<b><i>Test:</i></b> There is a test with a simple <b>
Sprocket Wear Measure Device/Tool</b> that looks similar to a Chain Whip, where 
one places the device's base between two sprocket teeth and lays the chain 
across the remaining sprocket teeth and if the third link (6th half link) will 
not hold onto the sprocket, then the pitch distance is too much (or the teeth 
are to worn). Roloff's point is that the 11 to 21 tooth sprockets need to be 
replaced immediately (because the chain can start slipping or rounding over the 
teeth - a safety hazard for the rider and damaging to the bike) and sprockets 
with more teeth can wait to be replaced (less urgent of a problem/situation). 
Other Manufacturers exist and tools costs and methods vary.<br>
<br>
<b><i>
Solution:</i> The solution for worn sprocket(s)/ring(s)/cog(s) is to replace 
the worn out sprocket(s)</b>. If the system does not have a new chain, then 
replace the chain too. Sprocket/ring/cassette replacement is strictly for a 
shop to perform (or one needs the experience, tools, and parts to perform the 
repair in the field). Normally when this happens, even though the noise is very 
bothersome, it is not critical and the cyclist that is on-a-tour can wait till 
they can ride the bike to the nearest bike shop.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Notes:</i></b> 
<ol> 
<li>The particular <b>sprockets that typically need to be replaced are the 
ones that the cyclist spends the most time</b>; typically this is the small 
front ring and/or the large back sprocket (aka the granny or climbing gears) 
and maybe an adjacent sprocket or two. Note that some rings and cassette 
sprockets are one piece and that the entire unit may need to be replaced.</li> 
<li>Bicycle shops generally Do Not perform Sprocket Wear Inspections often 
enough with a measurement tool; bicycle shops tends to make visual inspections 
and visual inspection tends to find overly worn sprockets way beyond their 
replacement time. Chain sprocket wear can be very subtle, visually.</li> </ol>

Chain Slack:</h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Noise Symptom/Solution 
Sub-Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> <b>Chain Suck is the term for a rotating chain that does not immediately 
roll-off or separate from the drive ring.</b> It causes extra wear, poor 
drive/power transfer to the rear wheel, and may make noise. The solution for 
Chain Suck is to take the slack out of the chain.<i><b>No single event robs a 
bicycle of wheel turning power than chain slack.</b></i> This power transfer 
process weakness is<b>exasperated by a dirty chain and sprockets</b>; be sure 
to operate with a clean chain and sprockets. Taking the slack out of the chain 
may be accomplished by:
<ol> 
<li>Working with a clean chain (degrease/degrime and clean lube the chain).
</li> 
<li>Adjusting the rear axle mount (only on some types of bike).</li> 
<li>Adjusting the eccentric (on tandems).</li> 
<li>Replacing the chain if it is worn out such that the pitch has changed 
significantly. Use a Chain Wear/Pitch Measure Indicator Tool - All bike shops 
have such a tool.</li> 
<li>Always Validate Proper Chain Length.</li> 
<li>Always Validate Sprocket Wear (previous section).</li> 
<li>Some bikes have an Anti-Chain Suck Device (that separates the chain and 
ring) in the space between the chain and ring at the point where the chain is 
supposed to go directly to the rear derailer. The device is pretty much like a 
metal finger that fits next to the chain egress to insure prompt chain-sprocket 
separation. The Anti-Chain Suck Device needs to be checked for wear and maybe 
adjusted. Note that when an Anti Chain device is functioning (that is, if/when 
the chain is hitting the Anti-Chain Suck Device) then that is a symptom of a 
drive train problem issue that needs to be resolved.</li> 
<li>Validate that the rear derailer is functioning to remove slack from the 
chain as one shifts up and down the rear cassette (strong tension arm springs, 
all 8 parallelogram points cleaned and lubed,Derailer Pulleys (Jockey Wheels)

<li>Simply <b>adjust the cable tension adjuster/barrel until the chain rides

the opposite. Always be prepared to undo what was done and to move the barrel

<ul>  Miss-threading the Chain through the Tension Arm's Jockey Pulleys will 
cause metal-on-metal chain rubbing/grinding noises.<br>
<br>
 The solution is 
to re-thread the chain properly:
<ul> 
<li>Sometimes the issue is chain placement/threading at the correct input or 
output point on the tension arm itself. [I do this myself about once a year and 
this is one of the reasons that I recommend marking the tension arm with little 
dots or dashes for the chain run.]</li> 
<li>Sometimes there is a little cross-support-bar in the center of the tension 
arm (the space in between the two jockey wheels) that the chain rubs upon. In 
the case of tension arm cross-support-bar rub, re-thread the chain on the other 
side of the cross-support-bar. [Cross-support-bars, when present, tend to be 
offset a little for this very reason - it is sometimes a case of intelligent 
engineering getting in the way of intelligent application].</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h4> C: Chain Rubs/Grinds on Something In the Rear Derailer Area<br>
 &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Chain Rubs on Itself in Rear Derailer Area</h4> 
<ul> 
<li> Most Rear Derailers use a <b>Body Adjustment Screw (usually called a B 
Screw</b> [with no explanation]).<br>
<b>Its PURPOSE</b> is to 'set' the 
distance between the 'Guide Pulley' [or Pilot Pulley or Jockey Wheel] and the 
closest Rear Sprocket/Cog - It should be 2-3 mm apart at its closest gear 
setting (test on each rear-sprocket/chain combination) and it hardly ever needs 
adjusting once it is set.<br>
<br>
<b>PERFORMANCE:</b> With all other things 
being equal, the closer the Pilot Jockey is to the rear sprockets/cogs, the 
snappier the shifting performance - Yes, it can be set too close (a person can 
tell by the grinding noise in at least one of the gear settings, but usually 
noise can be heard in all of the gear settings if the B-Screw is out of 
adjustment).<br>
<br>
<b>GRINDING NOISE</b> can have a couple different Source 
ISSUE/SOLUTIONS:
<ol> 
<li>B-Screw's, once set, rarely come out of adjustment on their own. But maybe 
it just needs to be re-set (making the chain proximity 2-3 mm at its closest 
point between the 'Guide Pulley' and the closest Rear Sprocket/Cog).</li> 
<li>If the derailer is removed and remounted (like for shipping), depending on 
the type of derailer, it is possible to mistakenly re-mount the rear derailer 
in such a way as to move the derailer's Stop Plate position for the B-Screw or 
to just miss-mount the derailer such that the B-Screw's setting is no longer 
correct. Unfortunately there are usually a couple different Stop Plate mounting 
position choices/options (it is often not 'Idiot Proof' [I can say from 
experience]). When a person re-mounts the rear derailer, the Stop Screw needs 
to be against the Stop (rotate the Derailer or Stop Plate so that the Stop 
Plate meets the end/tip of the B-Screw [some Stop Plates are free, some Stop 
Plates are fixed]).</li> 
<li>On occasion, a bike accident, crash or fall will have caused the rear 
derailer mounting point on the frame to bend. This may also be caused by 
something locking the wheel or chain but the cyclist's pedal pressure<b>&sup1; 
&sup2; &sup3;</b> may have caused the chain to tighten up on the derailer and 
physically cause the derailer's frame mount to bend or cause the derailer to 
bend internally (to include a combination of both objects to bend). If that 
happens, take the bike to a shop, but if the rider is miles away from a shop 
because they are on tour, then the rider will need to make their own 
adjustments, sometimes this means re-bending the bike frame, derailer frame 
mount, or derailer back into position.<br>
<b>Caution:</b> Be careful, metal 
does not like to be re-bent more than a couple times before it cracks from 
bending pressure.<br>
<b>Survival Note:</b> Steel is the most forgiving 
material and therefore the most survivable bike tour frame material and 
material of choice of global trekkers.<br>
 &sup1; <b>Survival Note:</b> This 
is a slightly bigger problem for tandems and triples &#133; because there is 
significantly more combined leg-pressure.<br>
 &sup2; <b>Survival Note:</b> 
When a chain won't go into a gear properly, stop the pedal pressure, stop the 
bike, and physically look at the situation/problem. This is darn good behavior 
when you are hundreds of miles from help.<br>
 &sup3; <b>Survival Note:</b> If 
a cyclist is in a high-gear setting and needs to be in a low-gear setting, 
physically stop and manually place the bike into the correct gear - A rider 
will live longer with this adapted behavior.</li> 
<li><b>Long Term SOLUTION:</b> It really helps to indicate the matching mount 
points between the frame, stop plate, and/or derailer pre-marked with a marking 
pen to line up the derailer, frame, and B-Screw Stop appropriately on the 
Bike's Frame.</li> </ol> </li> </ul><br>

<h3>Clink Noise in Rotating Chain (One Click per Chain Revolution):</h3> Top 
Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Can be a chain link that is too tight. Flex back and forth sideways, also 
the near side cradle of a chain break tool is exactly for this purpose. See
Loosen a Kinked or Tight Chain Link for details.</li> 
<li>The noise can also come from a pin or rivet that in not filly inserted or 
it is over inserted (or for other reasons). Sometimes the pin or rivet can be 
seen, but often it requires feeling the length of the chain on both sides for a 
pin or rivet that is sticking out just a little more than the others. The 
extruding pin/rivet may be on the inside/fame-side of the chain's run. See
Pushing in a Pin/Rivet for details.</li> 
<li>A Derailer cable that is too loose (typically) or tight (rarely) can also 
cause a sound that sounds like a misaligned chain or a broken sprocket tooth. 
Check to see that the chain is riding centered on the sprocket ring, if it is 
offset or rubbing another sprocket ring (and the derailer is otherwise 
operating in the biggest and smallest sprocket rings OK), then consider a 
derailer cable tension adjustment - SeePrevious Section.</li> 
<li>Bent tooth on a sprocket or cassette. Bend the point to a straight 
position. Let a shop Mechanic do this, but in the field, this sometimes may be 
performed with an adjustable wrench - bend the entire tooth but not the ring. 
In the field, if the rear cassette is a single piece, then one may need to get 
creative with some big tools like the end of a pair of pliers, a large screw 
driver, the handle end of a cone wrench (with cover removed), and/or maybe a 
hammer stone. Check rear derailercable tension also.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Click Noise in Front Crank (One Click per Pedal Revolution):</h3> Top 
Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>It can be a bottle or cage that needs to be bent back into proper position.
<b>Experience:</b> We have multiple water bottle cages on most of our bikes, we 
learned over time that we needed to label them for their positions - The cages 
near the cranks had to be bent away from the crank side. Some tandems have left 
and right side cranks.</li> 
<li>It can be the Tire Pump on a side or cage mounted pump.</li> 
<li>It can be a slightly loose saddle and/or seat mount (often the creak noise 
results from very slight body shift for the down stroke of a particular leg).
</li> 
<li>Many road cycling bloggers report that they need to remove the seat post 
once a year, wipe off all old grease, thinly reapply a very thin new layer so 
thin that one can barely see it (spread with fingers), wipe any excess, 
re-mount the seat post and the creak or click noise goes away for another year.
</li> 
<li>It can be a loose crank fitting/retainer or a worn bearing set or race or 
both. A bike shop can determine this issue and resolve it - There is a range of 
things that can have changed from a loose lock nut to having to replace the 
bearings or bearing cartridge set.</li> 
<li>It can be the crank's pedal arm hitting the bike frame (usually the chain 
stay). The cause may have come from a few different events:</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>A bent crank arm</b>, which may have resulted from a bicycle crash, 
drop, smash, or shipment. Replace with a new crank arm and don't be surprised 
if a rider must buy/purchase said crank arm as a pair of arms (left side, right 
side) as the bike shop supplier may have no choice. In the field, for emergency 
purposes, one may be able to bend a metal crank arm enough to stop the crank 
arm from hitting the frame - the crank arm must be replaced as soon as possible 
as the original stress and the secondary bend back stress ruin the integrity.
<br> <b>Caution:</b> Re-Bending a crank arm takes lots of leverage. If it is 
done on the bike, the crank stem, bearing casing or cartridge may be damaged 
from the bending process. If it is done off the bike it is difficult to 
position the crank in a manner that allows just the correct amount of bending 
without damaging the stem or pedal fittings. In either case it is difficult to 
obtain the correct leverage with anything other than a big crescent wrench.<b>
Emergency:</b> Some people have successfully placed the pedal end of a crank, 
still mounted to the bike, onto a boulder and jumped onto the arm near the 
bottom bracket to perform an impact bend with a friend holding the bike in 
place. Do not put any stress on the frame or wheels.</li> 
<li><b>An out of position crank, laterally or sideways,</b> as a crank related 
adjustment, overhaul, install may not have centered the crank stem, bearings, 
cartridge bearings, or locking nut(s) properly within the bottom bracket.</li> 
<li><b>An out of position eccentric</b> (tandem or greater passenger size 
bicycle). Eccentrics are housings for cranks and they are adjustable 'fore and 
aft' (as well as laterally) within the bottom brackets. Most tandems have two 
bottom brackets (which may go by different component names) but a few tandems 
have three bottom brackets (for independent shifting).</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>Bicycle Wobble: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, Also See Wheel 
Vibration While Braking<br>
<br>
<b>WARNING:</b> Any time that one can feel a 
bicycle/ride wobble, SLOW DOWN immediately,<b>Your LIFE IS IN DANGER!</b> - 
Slow down using a Lazy S Pattern (NOT a straight line).Dennis' Suspicion: A 
straight line does not allow high or low frequency resonate waves so dissipate 
within the bike frame but for some reason, based on survival experience, lazy S 
turns allow successful recovery. Of course some wobbles have nothing to do with 
resonating frames, it could be a loose fitting somewhere, but be alert to 
resonance.What is Resonance? It is a secondary vibration that results from the 
first vibration which can generate multiple following vibrations. Resonance can 
be felt or seen in the handle bar as the handlebar ends start to shake in 
repeating left and right turns and holding the handlebar tighter transfers the 
resonance from the handlebar to the wheel. The bicycle can literally trip over 
itself or the rider can loose total directional control,either event may lead 
to a crash.<br>
<b>WARNING</b> (Experience): Use the rear brake, as using the 
front brake seems to exasperate any resonance.<b>WARNING:</b> Any time that one 
can feel a wobble, one's life is in danger.<br>
<br>
 Check the following 
(Symptom - Solution):
<ul> 
<li>Poor tire to rim mount - redo, equal bead line</li> 
<li>Poor wheel mount to drop out - refit skewer to one side, eyeball balance, 
sometimes takes 3 or 4 attempts.</li> 
<li>Loose spokes - tighten, tune</li> 
<li>S&amp;S coupler(s) - check tight (Lynn Hamilton, AC Expedition Guide).<br>

 Experience: S&amp;S coupler(s) seem to need tightening once every seven rider 
days.</li> 
<li>Loose headset - tighten/fix (sometimes these need to be pretty snug)</li> 
<li>Balance of load in panniers - Left-Right sides should be within 1-2 pounds 
of one another.</li>

<h2>About Wheels </h2> 
<p>The Bicycle 'Wheel' consists of the Tire, Inner Tube (if not tubeless), 
Spokes, Rim, and Hub. Each one of the wheel components is important. Generally, 
the discussions herein are centered on Touring Survival rather than the merits 
of a wheel component brand.</p> 
<h3>General: Inner Tubes, Flats and Hints: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues 
Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Schrader air tire valves (the type cars use) can be filled at almost every 
gas/petrol station in the world and Presta valves are just the opposite.</li> 
<li>In freezing temperatures and freezing overnight temperatures, we've had 
Presta Valves slip completely out of their valve sleeve (they aren't supposed 
to do that, but it happens).</li> 
<li>Normal operating bike tires loose about 3-5 PSI per day. Beyond that, be 
looking for a cause (inner tube, valve, or tire). We have found that persistent 
problems over time often result from uncovered or unnoticeably sharp spoke end 
on the rim's inner base, or the tire has a single thin radial tire wire that 
only punctures (or can be felt) when there is air pressure inside the tire 
which expands the tire just enough to let the little pin do its slow leak thing.
</li> 
<li>Twelve Inch trailer tires are very difficult to remove or fix. Plastic 
tire tools can actually break - thus a reason for having metal tire tools.</li> 
<li>Self sticking tire patches are usually way better and faster than using a 
patch and glue. HOWEVER:<br>
<b>Experience</b>, we had a cold temperature patch 
repair problem such that a self sticking patch would not stick, period. At a 
temperature of 38-40&deg;F (2-3&deg;C), two different self sticking patches 
would not stick at all, so we broke out the Rubber Cement and put on a small 
dab of cement such that the patch area was tacky in one minute, we then applied 
the patch (which, in the mean time, was being warmed up in a shirt pocket). The 
repair held up.<br>
<b>Lesson:</b> Keep that little sealed tube of Rubber 
Cement that comes with tire repair kits as there are occasions when using 
Rubber Cement is the only patch repair solution.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> When buying spare tubes, beware that there are long valve 
stems and short valve stems. Unless the wheel rim requires a long stem (because 
of a double rim wall) then a short stem will be easier to place into the rim. 
Some long stems require that a tire be completely removed in order to re 
install the tube and tire at the same time. Generally, a cyclist only needs to 
remove the tire bead from one side of the rim. When placing a tube in the tire, 
remember to pre-fill the tube with enough air so as to prevent tube folds and 
to help evenly center the tire on the rim.</li> 
<li>Most tire repairs made in the rain or tropical like super humid conditions 
do not hold up very long. Determine and address the cause of the leak, usually 
a nail or wire, and just replace the inner tube. Keep and fix the damaged inner 
tube later, e.g., in the evening under dryer conditions.</li> 
<li>Mark the tire rim with desired (maximum) psi/pressure/atmosphere with 
grease pencil. Place the pressure marking on the rim center next to the air 
stem (and do NOT mark the rim side where the brakes rub). We also mark the 
trailer wheel or trailer for trailer tire pressure.</li> 
<li>Place a grease pencil dot on the tire and on the rim so that the cyclist 
will know both:
<ol> 
<li>Exactly where the tire lines up with the rim (to help keep the tire/wheel 
balanced), and</li> 
<li>Which side of the tire and rim match (left side to left side or right side 
to right side which in turn keeps positions tread pattern in the most 
beneficial manner).</li> </ol> Knowing these things greatly assists in tire 
un-mounting and re-mounting time and safety, and it helps with inner tube 
repair and placement time.</li> 
<li>Grease pencils are sold at hardware stores, sometimes they are only sold 
in packaged combinations. We like Yellow best. Also, we break long pencils into 
three inch lengths, as that is a handy size and packs well with a tire repair 
kit.</li> 
<li>If all of the flat tires are in the rear tire, then if possible, the 
traveler probably needs to be distributing more weight to the front wheel. 
Also, one may need heavier duty tires (or maybe just new tires).</li> 
<li><b>Flat Tire Repair Lessons Learned:</b> Experienced Riders do and maintain
<b>Four (4) Mental/Physical Tricks</b> when proceeding to fix a flat tire: 
<ol> 
<li>Lay the tire to the side without the rear-derailer, usually this is the 
left side. This action keeps dirt and debris out of the drive train. Some 
people set the bike upside down on the handlebar and seat/saddle, do so by NOT 
putting the side with the derailer to the ground.</li> 
<li>Keep the Inner Tube's relative side the same as the bike Tire and Rim 
(physically and often by a mark (like a grease pencil mark on one side of the 
tube's stem - the same side as the tire and rim dot marks). A cyclist can also 
use a pen, or a spit &amp; dirt smear). This trick is done so that one may back 
track from the hole in the tube to find the hole causing object in the tire (if 
it is still there).</li> 
<li>Make a conscious effort to keep the tire lined up on the rim just as it 
was before the tire went flat (so that one can come back and trace back to the 
offending causal object and be able to remount the tire and not worry about 
correct/desired tread pattern direction). A very good reason to have adjacent 
tire and rim grease pencil dots.</li> 
<li>When the rider finds the inner tube leak point, the rider will note the 
distance from the air stem point and trace the same distance on the tire, in 
the same direction and then find and remove the offending object from the Tire.
</li> </ol> </li> 
<li><b>Flat Tire Air Filling Lessons Learned:</b> Sometimes when a tube 
appears to be installed and filled correctly, it will have twisted or folded 
onto itself and either anomaly creates a weak point in the tube.<i>A pinched or 
twisted tube</i> will wear unevenly and break or leak in a rather short period 
of time, measured in a few minutes or hours.<b>There are three mutually 
supporting solutions,</b> in fact, perform as many solutions as is possible:
</li> 
<ol> 
<li>Very lightly sprinkle Tire/Inner-Tube Lubricant (like Talcum Powder) on 
the inside of the tire, the focal area is the tire interior surface that is 
opposite where the ground contacts the tire (or treat or have already treated 
the replacement tube).</li> <br>
<b>NOTE:</b> When I was kid, I seem to 
remember that inner tubes came with a powdery substance on the exterior.
<li>Pre-Fill the tube with just enough air to give the tube a round full form 
without any folds or twists. It should be soft enough to easily push into the 
tire while one tire rim is between the wheel rims.</li> 
<li>After the tire and tube are mounted, fill the repaired tire's tube and 
then deflate the tube, maybe make any required mount symmetry adjustments *, 
and then refill the tube again. The deflation and inflation process seems to 
help spread the tube more evenly inside the tire. * Make sure that the tire 
sidewall fitting lines (or other symmetry indicators) are equally spaced from 
the wheel rim on each side.</li> </ol> 
<li><b>If a person patches or replaces the Inner Tube but doesn't find and 
remove the offending object in the Tire, the rider will have another flat to 
fix in about five minutes flat</b> (pun intended).</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tire/Tyre Selection: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory (Under 
Contruction)<br>
<br>

<ul> Tire Selection is a bit like aircraft design in that every choice made is 
at the exclusion of another capability. In aircraft design, if one wants to 
carry a heavy load then the wings have to be big (larger surface area) but if 
one wants to go fast then the wings need to be small (smaller surface area). In 
cycling if one wants the fastest tires then the tread must be almost 
non-existent (for asphalt/paved roads), carcass/walls thin, and the track 
narrow, all of which is at the expense of thickness for safety and flat 
avoidance, wide track for comfort and duration, and virtually no capability to 
ride on wet dirt slopes.<br>
<br>
<b>Fact:</b> Bicycles cannot hydroplane on 
paved roads as bicycles have more weight per square inch (or more weight per 
square centimeter) than automobiles [Source: John Barnett of the Barnett 
Bicycle Institute and author of the Barnett Manual]. Because tires don't 
hydroplane on wet surfaces of paved roads, tires don't actually need tread per 
se, tires need just enough cover material to protect the carcus integrity.<br>

<b>Warning:</b> Bicycles can slip out from under a rider when rounding curves 
on oil slick road surfaces or on newly re-oiled roads or on sandy corners - 
Personal Experience (Dennis Struck).<br>
<b>Warning:</b> Avoid cycling in the 
center of any paved road because that is statistically where automobiles and 
trucks drip/leak the most oil.<br>
<b>Note:</b> On a paved vehicle lane, the 
two tire track lines for automobiles and trucks is statistically the cleanest 
part of the road.<br>
<b>Warning:</b> The beginning of a rain shower/storm is 
statistically the worst time for any vehicle because water on the roadway 
causes oil spills/drips/seeps to surface - oil floats on water. If the rain 
shower is sustained then the oil float is washed off the road. It takes a 
little experience to identify road slickness and rider vulnerability. A quick 
shower sprinkle or the first 15 minutes of a rain shower present the most 
surface oil hazard on a paved road.<br>
<b>Warning:</b> Leaves on a paved road 
or on a dirt trail can act as a road lubricant every bit as good as oil; slow 
down a lot before having to stop or maneuver in leaves, especially at 
intersections. This is true for dry or wet leaves and the worse situation is 
dry leaves on top of old soggy/boggy leaves at an intersection.<br>
<b>Warning:
</b> Gravel can be every bit as treacherous as oil, especially when going 
downhill and/or when deep on the trail, or at paved or dirt intersections - 
Reminder from Ray F.BTW Gravel is <i>Grave</i> in French - Grave Wines come 
from vines grown in gravel - good stuff. <br>
<b>Warning:</b> Riding a bike 
downhill, fast, over 'Wash Board' ridges can cause a rider to lose directional 
control and loose upright stability. Smaller framed bikes and short wheelbase 
bikes seem to react more adversely to this condition (Terry).<br>

<h3>Bicycle Touring Rim Issues: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

 On long bicycle tours or after multiple bicycle tours, the wheel rims may 
crack from braking activity or load stress. Sometimes, this stress, including 
mountain trail riding, may result in broken spokes, spoke stretch, spoke nipple 
(nut) loosening, and wheel wobble issues.<i>There isn't a whole lot a person 
can do to prevent this kind of wear except to: brake less, carry only light 
loads, and stay away from bumps, rocks, and holes -<b>That's a joke</b></i>. 
<ul> 
<li>One thing that usually needs to be done is to buy beefier wheel rims.</li> 
<li><b>Heavy Duty / Touring Rims typically have a stronger material, thicker 
material, more spokes, stronger spoke fittings, and/or better quality spokes.
</b></li> 
<li>The majority of New Bicycles are not sold with Heavy Duty touring wheels.
</li> 
<li>Heavy Duty wheels (often an aftermarket purchase) endure better than most 
stock bicycle wheels.</li> 
<li>Most bicycle shop techs can be very helpful in helping a cyclist to secure 
a suitable touring wheel/rim setup.</li> 
<li>Often, only the rear wheel is at issue. Many touring cyclists only beef up 
the rear wheel. Again, a bicycle shop technician can help address this 
topic/issue.</li> <br>
<br>
<b>Heavy Duty Wheel/Rim Caveats:</b> <br>
<br>

<li>Some Trailer Wheel/Rims need to address the heavy duty stress issue.</li> 
<li>Cyclists over 200 pounds need to address the heavy duty wheel/rim stress 
issue up-front.</li> </ul><br>

<h3>Rim Integrity and Wheel Vibration While Braking: </h3> Top, Mechanical 
Issues Directory, Also See Wheel/Bicycle Wobble<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Check the Axle fit in the Dropout:</b> A poor fit of the axle in the 
dropouts is the #1 most Common Bicycle Touring Problem and a poor fitting 
causes other mechanical problems.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Spin the wheel</li> 
<li>Look for evenness between the rim and the brake pads or rotor to the brake 
pads. This action can indicate a good or bad axle mounting to the dropouts. 
This process assumes that the systems were OK before the wheel mount or 
re-mount.</li> 
<li>Usually if there is a problem it is from a poor mount of the axle but note 
that the dropouts can wear unevenly, bend, or otherwise not be perfectly 
symmetrical.</li> 
<li>On the road, some riders learn to square the mount to one fork dropout or 
the other and have no subsequent problems. It is not unusual to see an 
experienced rider fit and re-fit a mount up to three times to get the overall 
fit perfect. One symptom of a bad fit is a wheel vibration that (did not exist 
before) occurs when the brake is applied.</li> 
<li>On occasion, one can sense a steering alignment issue in that the frame 
and wheels seem to be not lined up. Bad steering alignment causes uneven tire 
wear and peculiar wheel and riding vibrations.</li> 
<li>In any case, if there are dropout-axle fitting issues, get the bike to a 
shop ASAP, as shops have special tools to fix or address these issues.</li> 
<li>Sometimes, what seems at first to be brake rub on a spinning wheel, is in 
fact a Fender, Fender Brace, or Rack Brace rub; adjust/repair as needed.</li> 
<li>In the field, for emergency repairs only, a large adjustable wrench (1st 
choice) or a tongue and groove pliers (2nd choice) may be used for re-shaping a 
drop out and on rare occasions, a round file may be used to re-shape a dropout.
</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Check for Tire Mount Evenness:</b> An uneven tire mount to the rim 
causes all kinds of annoying little vibration and wear issues.</li> 
<li><b>Check for Brake Rub:</b> Usually brake rub is caused by a poor wheel 
mounting to the dropouts, but it can be an indication of a brake system problem.
</li> 
<li><b>Check for Wheel Rim Rotation Roundness</b> (lateral and radial): 
Anything greater than 3/16 inch or 3 mm should have a tech or shop 
inspection/adjustment. This presumes that the tire is mounted evenly around and 
this presumes that the axle is mounted correctly in the dropouts.</li> 
<li><b>Check Outer Wall Thickness:</b> Thin Outer Walls are caused by rim 
brake wear over time - eventually the rim must be replaced, which is often the 
time to beef up the rim quality.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Outer Wall integrity can only be known by removing the tire and</li> 
<ol> 
<li>&quot;Mike-ing&quot; (micrometer measuring) the wall thickness, and/or</li>
<li>Visual inspection, and/or</li> 
<li>Feel</li> </ol> 
<li><b>WARNING:</b> If one can tell by visual inspection or by feel, then it 
is already beyond time to get a New Rim.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Check the Rim for Microscopic Cracks:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Look for longitudinal cracks, both, along the sides (Outer Wall) and the 
top (Spoke Wall - what faces the axle).</li> 
<li>The cracks are usually very fine and are usually microscopic (they 
typically seem to be hairline, mini-lightning bolt looking, and slightly 
purplish on steel/alloy Rims).</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>Tire Air Pressure Measures and Equivalence/Equivalents Table: </h3> Top 
Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> This crossover table has evolved because <b>different countries have 
different standards for measuring air pressure</b>. A cyclist may discover that 
the air pressure system at a petro station has psi (USA), atm (France), bar 
(British, Europe), or ksc (Asia and Metric) for units of measure. If the 
cyclist is lucky, the pressure nozzle may be labeled, most are not. By our own 
experience and observation, Atmosphere, Bar, and KSC are all so very close in 
unit value that the measurement difference is negligible; usually close is good 
enough. However, PSI is so different, that it is obvious; check some of the 
scale values.<br>

<blockquote> <b>Experience</b>: We have learned, over time, to memorize the 
word(s) for air pressure (for international travels). It doesn't just jump out 
in the 'Language for Dummies' books. It is noteworthy that the word 
'Atmosphere' (Greek origin) seems to be well understood internationally and 
also that if one simulates the up-down pumping motion on a stand up bike pump, 
one will have communicated completely; we have had 100% success in 
communicating our need (and receiving a positive helpful response). As an 
aside, people like to help 'fully loaded' bicycle tourists; the experiences 
will make a cyclist feel good about one's self, life, and humanity.<br>

<h3>Spoke Issues and Field Fix/Solutions: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory
<br><br>

<ul> 
<li>Generally, if the wheel rotates OK roundly, the spokes are OK. Conversely, 
if the wheel rotates out of round, there is usually a spoke issue.</li> 
<li>Spoke problems usually are that one or more spokes are either too loose 
(mostly) or too tight (rarely) but they can be broke and possibly partly 
missing.</li> 
<li>There are emergency broken spoke repair kits. It is worth having one for a 
tour. Read the instructions. Their big payoff is for rear wheel, cassette side, 
hub flange mounting.</li> 
<li>Some people carry spare spokes. The spokes must match the existing spoke 
system. On occasion, left side rear wheel spokes can be different from the 
right side. Rear wheels require a tool or two to remove the cassette so as to 
access the cassette side, hub flange's spoke mount.</li> 
<li>If anything is wrong, don't ride but get a tech.</li> 
<li>If one plucks each of a series of spokes, like a guitar, and the sound is 
like ping, ping, thud, ping; the thud is a loose spoke. Remember the fix is not 
to tune the spokes by ear, but to incrementally tighten and test in order to 
remove the wheel wobble.</li> 
<li><b>In the Field:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Spokes can be tightened or loosened with a spoke wrench, multi-tool 
wrench, or an adjustable wrench. Be careful to insure that the nipple is 
solidly in the wrench.</li> 
<li>It is very easy to accidently round a nipple with an adjustable wrench 
because it is not tight enough on the nipple.</li> 
<li>The best nipple adjustment tool is a horse-shoe shaped spoke wrench tool.
</li> 
<li>Note that there are three common nipple/nut sizes (3.23, 3.30, and 3.45 mm 
- others exist, and 3.23 is the most common - AKA Park Black). It is very easy 
to mis-select the incorrect nipple wrench size. Also note that many different 
sized and shaped spokes exist.<br>
<b>Many touring bicyclists carry a few extra 
spokes and nipples.</b></li> 
<li>A Spoke is a Bolt and a Nipple is a Nut (Note that the Nut's contact with 
the Rim is typically a flange on the other side of the Rim [there is a rare 
racing exception where the spoke nut is on the inside of the rim]).</li> 
<li>Spokes have Right-Hand threading (&quot;Righty Tighty, Lefty Loosey&quot; 
rules apply).</li> 
<li>Rotating the nipple/nut towards the axle, tightens.</li> 
<li>Normally tightening is what is needed somewhere.</li> 
<li>Some oil dripped into the nipple and spoke hole at the rim followed with 
some wheel spinning will make the nipple adjustment operation easier. Sometimes 
on must wait a few hours or in really bad cases, a few day for deep penetration 
with WD-40 or Liquid Wrench type products.</li> 
<li>Turning the bike upside-down facilitates the best work area (in the field).
</li> 
<li>Most mechanics deliberately perform nipple tightening and loosening below 
the axle as opposed to above the axle because the hand twist rotation direction 
is reversed on the top versus on the bottom.</li> 
<li>Work in increments that are either 1/4 or 1/8 nut turns followed by a 
wheel spin check. Some mechanics work in 1/6 turns because the nipple has six 
sides.</li> 
<li><b>There are Two commonly addressed Wheel Adjustment Dimensions</b> to 
conduct herein, Lateral [side-ways] and Radial [inward-outward]). It is best to 
work the lateral spoke issues first and then the radial issues, however, one 
spoke dimension adjustment will always effects the other spoke dimension.There 
is a third spoke adjustment direction (fore/aft-torsion) but only advanced and 
very unusual spoke lacing patterns need to address this issue and it's better 
left to Wheel Persons.</li> 
<li>Lateral Adjustments are usually balanced. Left spoke in 1/4 turn, Right 
spoke out 1/4 turn. Or, Left Spoke in 1/4 turn and two Right Spokes out 1/8 
turn. Every adjustment must result in less wobble or the adjustment must be 
undone.</li> 
<li>Consider using an extra large binder clip and a stick or wire on a chain 
stay or a seat stay, or use duct tape and a stick or wire for emergency truing 
work. Note that in many cases, the field work is just to get the wheel in good 
enough shape to get out of the field and into a bike shop.</li> 
<li>Wheel Spin checks are looking for less wheel wobble (left/right, up/down) 
per tool adjustment action. 1 MM or less wobble is the acceptable tolerance 
standard for most shops for most Wheel Rim types. 1-2 MM is OK for a field 
repair to get to a shop. 3 MM or more of wobble<b>may be dangerous to one's 
health.</b></li> 
<li>Don't adjust more spokes than two adjacent on one side or three in a row 
(two on one side and one from the other side) at any time.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>Advanced Rim/Spoke Issues: </h3> Top, Mechanical Issues Directory, 
<ul> 
<h4>Spoke Lacing: 3 Cross and 4 Cross Patterns are Quite Satisfactory</h4> &lt;
<i>This is for a bike mechanic to perform BUT<br>
 A cyclist may be asked about 
this issue when a wheel is ordered or repaired.</i>&gt; <br>
<br>
 Spoke Lacing 
addresses engineering problems and solutions that were actually resolved by the 
beginning of the 20th Century. It was discovered that certain spoke lacing 
patterns gave wheels a better/improved strength, flexibility, and durability 
over other patterns. Theories come and go and people who have been around for a 
while see a cycle of about 20 years where new ideas are offered, again, but it 
turns out that the new ideas are old ideas and they have already been tested 
and resolved, amended, or debunked. Which is one of the reasons why it is wise 
to have institutions of learning to record ideas, test concepts, and advance 
proven arguments.<br>
<br>
 BBI has tested different spoke lacing patterns for 
different sized wheels and found that for the 26&quot; and 700mm wheels (for 
this range of wheel/rim/tire sizes), that 3 Cross and 4 Cross spoke lacing 
patterns offer the most efficient and effective wheel support for Push and Pull 
Torsion, Lateral Flexibility, Load and Strength, and Durability.<br>
<br>

<h4><b>Pre-Setting the Spoke Bend</b><br>
 (All from BBI)</h4> &lt; <i>This is 
for a bike mechanic to perform.<br>
 Sometimes this step is incorrectly called 
'Stressing the Wheel'.</i>&gt; <br>
<br>

<li>SITUATION: If spokes aren't bent into shape for their crossing pattern 
from the factory, the spokes will eventually become bent for their shape on 
their own just by regular bike use over time.<br>
 Unfortunately two things 
happen if spokes areNOT pre bent: 
<ol> 
<li>Spokes wear out faster</li> 
<li>The Wheel Rim comes out of True.</li> </ol> </li> 
<li>SOLUTIONS: Pre Bend the Spokes. Spokes can be bent in a couple of 
different methods but the BBI Method is Best!</li> 
<ul> 
<li>BBI METHOD: Use a lever, about the size of narrow paint mixing stick (or a 
vinyl covered handle from a cone wrench) and lever open the spoke intersections 
to pre-bend the spoke. This must be done for each side (be careful, it is easy 
to mix-up spoke side sets). What is desired is for each crossing pair of spokes 
that come from different sides of the same hub flange to be pre bent.</li> 
<li>Another METHOD: The same spoke sets, just discussed, can be bent by 
squeezing the spokes together, by hand, at a point between the nipples and the 
intersection of the spoke crossing. This works but is not as efficient and as 
effective as the BBI Method because the bend is not at the natural spoke 
intersection.</li> </ul> 
<li>Always RE-CHECK for TRUE (for any method): Once the spokes are pre-bent, 
the wheel must be rechecked for true and adjusted if necessary.</li> 
<h4><b>Stressing the Wheel - 'Debunked'</b><br>
 (All from BBI)</h4> 
<li>Theory A: Over stressing the spoke (by over tightening the nipple and then 
backing it off). In theory, this is like tuning/stressing a guitar string, over 
tighten a little and then reset it as desired, in theory the stress takes out 
any stretch that may occur over time. In actuality, Nipples and Spokes can be 
over torqued and there is no standard way to make this method work every time - 
it does work sometimes, it does NOT work all the time.</li> 
<li>Theory B: Squeezing spoke pairs together will strengthen the wheel. This 
method may take a wheel out of true, it may not, but it may put an unnecessary 
bend in the spoke (discussed previously, a bend where it is not needed, a bend 
in the wrong place). This is a poor emulation of spoke bending at stress points 
(where spokes cross and bend naturally or by encouragement).</li> 
<li>Always RE-CHECK for TRUE (for any method): Once the spokes are 
manipulated, the wheel must be rechecked for true and adjusted if necessary.
</li> 
<h4><b>STABILIZING the TRUE:</b><br>
 (All from BBI)</h4> &lt; <i>This is for 
a bike mechanic to perform.<br>
 Sometimes this step is incorrectly called 
'De-Stressing or Un-Stressing the Wheel'.</i>&gt; <br>
<br>

<li>Once a wheel it trued, before being used on a bike, the torsional wind-up 
of tightened spokes must be released.</li> 
<li>The best way to stabilize a wheel (while it is still off the bike) and 
undo any 'wound up spokes' (spokes twist when tightened) is to side load the 
wheel by pushing the center hub down (on a block) while applying palm pressure 
at spoke pairs 180 degrees apart. One can physically feel the release with 
finger tips and often hear a pop or unwind whir. Flip the wheel for each flange 
set of spokes. THEN Re-check the true.</li> </ul><br>

<h3>Tire/Inner-Tube Lubricant (Myth or Necessity?): </h3> Top Mechanical 
Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>ABOUT TALCUM</b> (Persian <i>talq</i>) is a mineral from the ground 
(composed of hydrated magnesium silicate; which looks like dirty quarts but is 
vey soft, like Soapstone). According toWikipedia, Talcum is used for Electrical 
and Heat Insulation,<b>Baby Powder</b>, Cosmetics (talcum powder), Lubricant, 
and as Filler in paper manufacture. Its<b>Benefits to Bicyclists is that it has 
a distinct greasy feel and it is not soluble in water (it works in wet 
conditions without turning to mush) and talc can serve as an effective 
lubricant between the Tire and the Inner-Tube to keep them from sticking. Talc 
is particularly effective during the tube inflation process.</b> Talc color 
ranges from white to grey or green and can be used by bicycle mechanics in its 
powder form (most common, using a powder brush) or (sometimes) as a wide chalk 
like stick. Talcum is clean and wipes off easily from brushing one's hand 
together, brushing from clothes, or washing hands or clothing. Its use 
originally came from the auto tire industry, as certain early tubes and tires 
would stick together (incorrectly called Vulcanization); this rubber compound 
sticking or melding is no longer a problem in the bicycle or automobile tire 
industry.</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>TALCUM WILL WORK IF </b>one was to inflate a bicycle tube straight out 
of the box, inside a rim and tire, with no pre-filling the tube with air, and 
then Talc could help reduce tube folds or twists which would eventually wear 
the tube and cause an air leak (thus causing a flat tire).</li> 
<li><b>TALCUM IS NOT NEEDED IF </b>one was to pre-inflate a bicycle tube with 
just enough air pressure as to give the tube its round form and install the 
tube into the tire; then that action would usually prevent tube folds or twists 
(which would otherwise have eventually lead to a flat tire).<br>
<br>
<b>
Caution and Caveat</b> from John Salzbach of Rema Tip Top, a popular American 
Talc Manufacturer/Distributor (who corroborates the previous statements) hints 
that if a tire and tube have been dressed with talc, then one must clean the 
area to be patched very well or patch security may become 
&quot;problematic&quot;. Also, he states that Talc is still widely used in the 
Agriculture Industry.</li> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li><b>The purpose of adding a tube/tire lubricant was to:</b></li> 
<ol> 
<li>Keep the tube from sticking to the tire, particularly for the inflation 
process,</li> 
<li>Help easily remove a non-sticking tube,</li> 
<li>Keep drying patch cement on a repaired tube from sticking to the tire, and
</li> 
<li>And ALL of the other stuff is <b>MYTH:</b><br>
 Talcum has nothing to do 
with tube or tire/tyre longevity, leak prevention, or leak speed reduction. 
Bicycle Tires can and do get hot, but nothing like an automobile tire. Tires 
get hot on hot days from the sun and from heavy loads (like from touring), but 
tires don't get hot from just riding around (like for autos and trucks). Tubes 
do stick to tires on occasion, just from being pressed together over a time 
frame, but it doesn't appear to be cause for Tire Lube alarm.</li> </ol> 
<li><b>Some bicycle race teams/racers seem to use talc</b> (to pre lube tires 
before hand) for quick tube changes for races or by racers - So the concept is 
not dead.</li> 
<li><b>Auto Shops and Bicycle Shops use a much diluted soap-water solution</b> 
to coat tires with a slightly slippery liquid substance to aid in mounting 
tires and for removing tires from rims. Furthermore, soap-water solutions give 
tires a slightly tacky bead for installing and sealing bicycle and automobile 
tubeless tires to the rim.</li> </ol><br>

<h3>Tire Air Pump: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Pumps can often be Bike Mounted but a slight amount of weight can be saved 
by carrying the pump in a bag (along with other wheel care equipment).</li> 
<li>If the pump is to be stored away, always make it easily available.</li> 
<li>Insure that the Air Pump is actually capable of attaining the tire's 
maximum desired tire air pressure. Many pumps do not achieve this requirement.
</li> 
<li><b>Story:</b> The ToPeak Mountain Morph with Gauge is the very first 
bicycle air pump that we have ever used that would actually achieve 
full/desired/advertized tire pressure (100+ PSI).<b>Addendum:</b> ToPeak only 
makes the Road Morph now; it is more slender and 1 or 2 inches longer and it 
performs just as well as the Mountain Morph.</li> 
<li>Be very careful about valve types and mixes. This issue can be more of a 
problem renting bikes in foreign locations (both a pump issue and a tire valve 
issue).</li> 
<li>Some tire valves require a separate adapter or a special adapter if one 
does not have an appropriate tire pump. Not a good thing to learn 2 days from a 
bike shop or tire store.</li> 
<li>Some (read as most) multi valve type pumps don't do a good air fill job on 
any type of valve.</li> 
<li>Since about 2003, most bike mounted tire pumps, are convertible between 
Schrader and Presta tire valve types.</li> 
<li>Don't confuse a pump that has two different air valve ends (Dual Valve, 
Presta and Schrader) with a pump that has one end and is convertible between 
Presta or Schrader. They are two different things and, in our experience, the 
convertible is better and the dual is NOT worth owning.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> A biker can fill a Schrader tire valve at almost any 
petro station in the world (including fuel, gas, or tire shops). A Schrader 
tire valve is the same valve that car tires have. On the other hand, virtually 
No fuel/petro/gas station can handle putting air through a Presta bike tire 
valve. Approximately Only Five Percent of car tire shops can handle a Presta 
tire Valve.</li> 
<li> There are Presta to Schrader adapters and every biker should carry an 
adapter regardless of their tire valve type.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> If the amount of air pressure loss is greater than 5 PSI a 
day, then start looking for another pressure loss cause.</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> It generally seems that bike tires lose about 3-5 PSI 
per day, such that bike tires need to be filled/topped off every other day.</li>
<li>Optional: Spare Tire and Tire [Repair] Boot</li> 
<li>Optional: Heavy Duty Manual Pump (Usually stays with transport vehicle or 
in the trailer of one biker in a group).</li> </ul> 
<h3>Slime for Touring: </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> <b>We have had no luck using &quot;Slime&quot;</b> in our tires and we 
recommend that it not be used for touring. Slime is liquid goo that turns into 
a fibrous solid material when it is exposed to air. Ideally, on a leaking tire, 
a punctured tire will self seal as soon as the Slime material comes in contact 
with the outside atmosphere, thus preventing a tire from going flat. But<b>what 
happens over time, nearly as we can tell, is that eventually the Slime around 
the air stem/valve begins to harden up from air being put into the tire.</b> 
Eventually the hardening Slime will cause an Air Pressure gauge to have a 
faulty reading such that more pressure is in the tire/inner tube than indicated 
by the gauge, thus a high pressure blowout occurs (under touring conditions). 
We had this happen to three of four bike tires, over time - we eventually 
figured it out and swapped out all Slime filled tires and our abnormal high 
rate of flat tires problem went away.<br>
<br>
 ** Feedback: From Harry, of 
Ted's Bicycles in Colorado Springs, has added two important pieces of 
information for those that do/must use Slime:
<ol> 
<li>Remove the air valve component from the tire stem before adding slime. 
Fill with Slime. Then, install air valve (as quickly as practical).</li> 
<li>Be sure to store, carry, or park the bike with the air stems in any 
position other than straight down (as the slime tends to settle with gravity 
over time and work its way up the stem if the stem is at the lowest gravity 
position). Perhaps the 4 or 8 O'clock is the best storage positions for the 
stem (in order to facilitate Slime drainage from the stem). At 6 O'clock, slime 
can run up and into the stem by sheer volume and at 11-12-1 O'clock, slime can 
settle into the stem.</li> </ol> <br>
<b>Addendum (2010):</b> There is, now, a 
new kind of double lined tube that has slime in just the lining and the lining 
is just on the tread side of the tube. The lining protects the slime from the 
air valve and normal tube air pressure. So far we have not used/tested this 
product nor found it with an extended presta valve.<br>
<br>
</ul> 
<h3>Tire Liners for Touring (Avoid Them): </h3> Top Mechanical Issues Directory
<br><br>

<ul> <b>We have tried to use &quot;Tire Liners&quot; to no avail</b> (at a 
different time than the Slime problem). In theory, Tire Liners lay between the 
inner tube and the tire itself, thus presenting a puncture barrier to thorns, 
nails, and other objects that cause puncture flats. What happened over time, in 
every case for us, is that when we had a flat tire, an inspection of the inner 
tube showed a wear pattern on the tube caused by the Liner. In fact anyone 
could see an exact outline of the edge of the liner on the inner tube. The 
inner tube's leak point would always be where the inner tube was most worn from 
the Liner. We quit using liners and replaced all the inner tubes and the 
unusual high rate of flat tires problem went away.</ul><br>

<h3>Tools (Touring Issues and What to Carry): </h3> Top Mechanical Issues 
Directory<br>
<br>

<h4>FIRST: Some Important Tool Touring Issues</h4> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Duplicate Tools</b> (a double edged) <b>Issue:</b> In traveling groups, 
there is usually no need to carry duplicate specialty tools. However ...<br>
<b>
Caution:</b> Sometimes, bikers part ways or loose bikes or equipment (for a 
variety of reasons). The concern is about the parting biker having or having 
had a special tool or something else that the group needs or will need (like 
tickets, keys, codes, telephone numbers, ...). Make a mental note to protect 
the remaining group's travel and safety integrity when member 
equipment/knowledge separation occurs. This usually means that someone in the 
group needs to remember to get the needed object/information from the departing 
biker or that the object needs to be purchased (or ordered or a particular 
issue needs to be addressed) at the next opportunity.</li> 
<li><b>About Tongue and Groove Pliers</b> (narrow mouth): In many cases a good 
Channel Lock type of pliers can perform many bike wrench 
requirements/functions. AKA Channel Lock, water pump, or grip lock pliers. 
Ideally, the tool mouth/head should be narrow enough to fit in tight/narrow 
places, but not so narrow as to break under pressure. This is one of those rare 
cases where a cheap looking, inexpensive light duty (versus heavy duty) Tongue 
and Groove Pliers is quite functional and half the weight of heavy duty Tongue 
and Groove Pliers.</li> 
<li><b>About Knives:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>If a person is going to have a knife for touring, they may as well have a 
Swiss Army type knife that at least has a big and small blade, awl, scissors, 
bottle &amp; can opener, Phillips tip screw driver, flat tip screw driver, and 
tweezers. For some people (like us), the knife must also have a cork screw!</li>
<li>Most bikers don't want anything in their pockets while biking, but as soon 
one stops for any duration in a remote area, people should have a knife on 
their person.</li> 
<li>Always know where the knife is located and if there is one knife between a 
couple of cyclists/campers, it is a nice courtesy to let the other 
cyclist/camper know where the knife is located.</li> 
<li>Post Script: We carry a second knife in/with the kitchen ware - it is only 
to be used for cooking and the chief cook will get very &lt;insert word 
here&gt; if the knife is used for anything other than kitchen work - ALL 
lasting friendships and relationships have boundaries, learn them.</li> </ul> 
</ul> 
<h4>While Touring, What Tools Should A Cyclist Carry?</h4> 
<p>This information was getting spread out over this website. This tool 
information is now consolidated under two functions. The answer is a fuction of 
two variables: How many cyclists? How many days? Note that the amount of Days 
is directly related to Travel or Tour Distance.</p>

<h3>Bar-End as Handlebar Guard and Brake/Shifter Cover Guard: </h3> Top 
Mechanical Issues Directory<br>
<br>

<ul> <b>CAUTION: One should consider using mountain bike bar ends as guards 
for handlebar brakes and shifters.</b> One bike fall (from falling over the 
kick stand or slipping down from a structure or from crash impact) can cause 
debris to enter the system and gum up the inner workings or even break a 
shifter or a brake component.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Experience:</b> We have learned 
from our mountain bikes that the bar ends can protect and guard the brake 
and/or shifter system from damage. Integrated Brake/Shifter systems are even 
more susceptible because they are more complicated (&amp; expensive) and 
actually more open to getting debris inside their inner workings. See above 
image.<br>
<br>
<b>Brake/Shifter Cover/Guard Instructions</b>: See image at 
left. Cut an old tire inner tube to the shape demonstrated in the picture. It 
may take two attempts. Additionally, use self stick Velcro circles, about 3/8 
inch or about 1 centimeter round diameter. The ambient air temperature must be 
warm to hot! First, Use a clean dry towel or paper towel to wipe the powder 
residue from the inner tube. Second, use Acetone (NOT Paint Thinner, NOT 
Mineral Spirits - they add oils) and a clean cloth to finish cleaning the inner 
tube residue, especially paying attention to the areas for placing/sticking the 
Velcro pads. While the inner tube may be just a little tacky from the acetone 
wipe and while the ambient temperature is warm, apply the Velcro sticky pads. 
Leave the cover/guard component alone for 24 hours and then mount the 
cover/guard to the brake/shifter system (see the next picture).<br>
<br>
<b>
Experience: We cover our Integrated Brake/Shifter assembly with a home made 
inner tube wrap</b> that keeps dirt and debris out of Brake/Shifter moving 
components (because when a bike falls, often the first thing to impact is the 
brake/shifter lever if there is no guard thus causing the assembly to open and 
expose the moving components to foreign objects and damage). All the 
sophisticated system needs, to be damaged, is one tiny one millimeter stone 
chip, a piece of bark, or a stucco chip to reduce functionality or even ruin a 
touring trip.<br>

<p><b>Brake Lever Strap (I.e., Parking Brake):</b> The way that the original 
concept was learned here, was via Matt or Bren at bikehacks.com (
http://bikehacks.com/ecovelo-parking-brake-for-your-bike/). They, in turn, got 
these ideas from Kevin Kelly at kk.org (
http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001289.php who uses a cork to hold open a 
STI brake assembly and more recently from Alan at ecovelo.info (
http://www.ecovelo.info/2008/07/21/parking-brake/) who has used an Elastic Hair 
Band to lock down a brake lever. All of these ideas are good. Following are 
some helpful visual images:</p> <br>

<h3>All About Thread Lock Compounds (aka: Threadlock):</h3> Top Mechanical 
Issues Directory<br>
<br>
<b>Why this is important?</b> Bolts and Nuts may (and 
often do) unfasten in the middle of a tour, possibly leaving a cyclist stranded 
but more likely adding a couple of unexpected days to a tour in an undesirable 
location while the cyclist(s) figure a way to manage the effects of a broken or 
missing bike part. One mitigation scheme is to carry spare nuts and bolts but 
another mitigation scheme is to carry a Tread Lock compound and fasten the 
Bolts and Nuts preventively (discussed herein). Said rather simply, <i>Thread 
Lock causes nuts and bolts to temporarily adhere to one another and the setting 
will last until a lot of wrench torque is applied to the fasteners.</i><br>
<br>

Maintenance] 6th Ed - Electronic, by John Barnett, Barnet Group Inc, 2008;

<br>
<b>Thread Lock Chemical 
Compounds, In General:</b><br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Thread Lock is an anaerobic (sets without air) expansion compound that 
takes on the property of glue.</li> 
<li>Thread Lock compounds are TOXIC - Don't Touch, clean hands immediately - 
read instructions.</li> 
<li>There are two main differentiating Thread Lock product type 
characteristics -<br>
 They are either <i>Temporary</i> or <i>Permanent</i>. <b>
Only Use Temporary</b>.</li> 
<li>Thread Lock <b>does NOT work on plastic NOR on nylon</b> (core/liner 
threads on some nuts).</li> 
<li>The temporary compound cracks and crumbles under release pressure but the 
permanent compound will not budge without damaging or breaking the assembly, 
however heat can be applied to some permanent compounds to make them release. 
It's best to Avoid Permanent Thread lock for Bicycles.</li> 
<li>Thread Lock compound also inhibits oxidation and/or galvanic [metal to 
metal bonding] corrosion.</li> 
<li>There are many Thread Lock compounds brands/products which may work 
equally well - Read/study the properties on the label (found in Bike Shops, 
Auto Parts Stores, and Hardware Stores.)</li> 
<li>Until about 2010, Thread Lock compounds were not available in bike shops 
nor hardware stores, one had to go to or special order to a big city fastener 
specialty store or tool supply store. At or after 2010, Thread Lock compounds 
could be found in some major hardware stores (big box stores). If one has a 
choice, the small Tube is more functional for bike touring than the little 
bottles but a little bottle is better than nothing. Loctite's Medium Strength 
(called Blue) or the equivalent brand's medium strength is the single best 
strength choice to carry and use for bicycle touring.</li> </ul> <b>Usage:</b> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Generally</b>, the bolts closest to the wheel axle seem to take the 
brunt of the travel vibrations and those nuts and bolts seem to be the first to 
loosen.</li> 
<li>The first nuts or bolts to loosen are most typically the pannier rack 
support fasteners and the fender fasteners. If traveling for more than two or 
three days, those bolts will need Threadlock.</li> 
<li>Keep a clean/dry rag or tissue handy, when applying Threadlock.</li> 
<li>It seems that most people (including <i>moi</i>) apply too much the first 
time and a much of the control problem derives from the delivery system (bottle 
design). No problem, just wipe off excess or wipe off all of it and try 
application again.</li> 
<li>Threadlock is usually applied as one drop spread around the threads of a 
Bolt at the insertion end. Some larger Bolts may use two drops. The measured 
length of the Threadlock fluid/drop is typically .15 inch (1/8) or 2 mm (no 
more than .25 inch or 4 mm) on the threads at the end of the Bolt. If applied 
to a Nut apply 1/2 a drop (takes luck, skill, or practice) or one drop (max) - 
there is usually no choice as to where to place the drop because the Nut 
opening is often smaller than the Threadlock brush or nozzle.<br>
<b>Caution:
</b> New bottles and tubes of Threadlock often deliver more fluid than intended.
<br> <b>Caution:</b> Be careful opening Threadlock, as the contents may be 
under a little pressure and<br>
<b>Be Extra Cautious</b> at altitude when 
opening a new container.<br>
 If too much Threadlock fluid/gel is applied to 
the object, then immediately wipe away the excess or just wipe it clean and 
start over. This excess application issue happens to everyone sooner or later.
</li> 
<li>Known problem nuts or bolts should get some Threadlock applied.</li> 
<li>While on Tour, apply Threadlock to nuts and bolts as they are discovered 
loose (or for replacement of missing fasteners). It does not take long to 
develop a feel for this type of maintenance.</li> 
<li><b>Caveat:</b> Threadlock is for active bicycle touring and not for 
shipping. Do not just apply Threadlock everywhere. Don't use Permanent 
Threadlock or Superglue (except for dire circumstances). Oil and Threadlock are 
not used in conjunction (as the compounds offset each other's properties). 
Threadlock, so far, is Not effective on plastic/nylon lined nut fasteners 
(nylon linings serve the same purpose as Threadlock compounds).</li> 
<li><b>Caveat:</b> Threadlock will not work on plastic lined nuts and may 
actually weaken the plastic's tight friction property.</li> 
<h3>BRANDS (Three Examples of Thread Lock Compound)</h3> 
<h4>LocTite (usually found in Tool Stores or Hardware Stores):</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Use Loctite 222 (Temporary) &quot;Purple&quot; (colored fluid - not bottle 
color) on small bolts of less than 7mm diameter.</li> 
<li>Use Loctite 242 (Temporary) &quot;Blue&quot; (colored fluid) on bolts of 
7mm or larger diameter.</li> 
<li>Loctite 272 and 277 are Permanent compounds and are colored 
&quot;Red.&quot;</li> 
<li>Presently, all Loctite bottle colors are Red (or a shade of Red) and all 
bottle caps are White.</li> 
<li>Many long range bike travelers use temporary Loctite for pannier bolts 
(and other fasteners that come loose) on bike tours - Be careful that one is 
using temporary Loctite and NOT permanent Loctite.</li> 
<li>The previous Loctite types are known by their color and are often referred 
to by their color name.</li> 
<li>John Barnett, of BBI, recommends that if a bicyclist only wants to carry 
one Loctite bottle/type, then they should carry Loctite 242 and use it for all 
fasteners.</li> 
<li>Only one small bottle needed per tour group. Bottles are 10 ml and 50 ml 
($20-$45 USD respectively in year 2008) - NOT Cheap.</li> 
<li>If a bolt is already installed, and a person wants to apply a penetrating 
temporary locking chemical compound use Loctite 292 (which is Green in color).
</li> 
<li>For reasons unknown, one cannot find Loctite Numbered Compounds in Bicycle 
Shops, Hardware Stores, nor Auto Shops (although the stores may carry other 
Loctite products) - Apparently, this is some sort of Distribution Legal Issue. 
These Loctite products can be found Online and in commercial 
&quot;Fastener&quot; type stores.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Permatex (usually costs the least and can be found in Auto and Hardware 
Stores):</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Permatex Low Strength Threadlocker Purple is a temporary thread lock 
compound for bolts less than 7mm, Purple is their low strength thread lock 
color. The product ID is 24024 and only comes in a 6ml tube.</li> 
<li>Permatex bottles and Tubes are Blue colored with White caps.</li> 
<li>Threadlocker LS Purple is directly equivalent to Loctite 222.</li> 
<li>Permatex Medium Strength Threadlocker Blue is a temporary thread lock 
compound for bolts less of 7mm and larger, Blue is their medium strength thread 
lock color. It can be found in a small tube, small bottle, or larger bottle</li>
<li>Threadlocker MS Blue is directly equivalent to Loctite 242.</li> 
<li>Permatex makes a Threadlocker Red, which is more or less permanent (can be 
removed with heat) which equates to the Loctite 272 and 277 products.</li> 
<li>Permatex makes a Threadlocker Green, a temporary compound added after a 
bolt is fastened, which is equivalent to Loctite 292.</li> 
<li>Permatex Threadlockers seem to be more easily found in Hardware and Auto 
type supply stores.</li> <br>
</ul> 
<h4>Vibra-Tite (ND Industries; Nylok-Detroit Corporation) - usually found in 
Tools Stores:</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>ND Part# 111 (equivalent to Loctite 222)</li> 
<li>ND Part# 121 (equivalent to Loctite 242)</li> 
<li>ND Part# 146 (equivalent to Loctite 277)</li> 
<li>ND Part# 137 (equivalent to Loctite 272)</li> 
<li>Their coloring scheme seems to match Loctite's color scheme</li> 
<li>Their Product Numbers are different from the part numbers. Product numbers 
seem to be in the sequence of [Part#]+[VolumeCode] such that a 10 ml bottle of 
111 would have a product number of 11110, or a 50 ml bottle of 121 would have a 
part number of 12150.</li> 
<li>ND thread Lock compounds are less expensive than Loctite's.</li> </ul> <br>

<h3>About Panniers and Panniers Checklist:</h3> Top Trailers 
<p><b><i>Pannier</i></b> or <b><i>Panier</i></b> derives from Middle French 
and Latin meaning Bread Basket<br>
 (literally: pertaining to bread). Now, 
Pannier equates to Saddle Bag.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Panniers, clean and with all parts in working condition (tight bolts, 
nuts, screws; straps and buckles; reflectors plastic-devices, cloth-strips; 
hooks, clamps; rubber mounts, pads)</li> 
<li>Additional weight, anywhere, changes the handling characteristics, to 
include steering. Practice with loads (real or simulated). Don't take on single 
track until ready and capable. Start with paved roads and then dirt roads.</li> 
<li>Ideally, for the long haul (survival), one wants each of the two wheels to 
support 50% of the total weight. At issue, for single rider bicycles, is that 
most cycles are designed to carry a greater portion of the riders weight to the 
rear tire, therefore, when packing panniers (front and back), a rider would 
need more of the packed weight in the front of the bike.</li> 
<li><b>Note:</b> Heavier front loads require more arm strength, therefore some 
riders place more weight in the rear and some riders prefer to pull a loaded 
trailer (thus freeing up front weight for control and changing the percentage 
of weight on the bike's tires). Mountain trail touring tends to have better 
handling with more of a 40% front / 60% rear distribution (and no trailer), or 
an almost empty bike pulling a fully loaded trailer. Each of these scenarios 
has different riding, handling, and steering characteristics.</li> 
<li><b><i>Cool Story!</i></b> (&lt;&lt;actual picture on right side&gt;&gt;)
</li> 
<li><b>Note:</b> Tire wear, between the front and back tire, is proportional 
to weight distribution. So many people try to rotate their tires near the 
estimated halfway to replacement point in order to get the most out of their 
tires (maximum distance). Keep in mind that tread is needed for traction, 
control, and safety, so the tire's replacement point will still have a safe 
amount of tread. [And when a new tire can be purchased is a factor as well: 
Bikers tend to take advantage of bike shops when they can be found because 
touring tends to mostly be away from bike shops. That is, change tires early 
versus later.]</li> 
<li>Generally, carry the smaller but heavier objects in the front: tools, 
parts, lube, stove, fuel, and cook ware. In addition, the (front) handlebar bag 
tends to also contain small but dense objects.</li> 
<li>Larger, bulky, and less dense objects tend to be placed in the rear: 
sleeping bags and pads, tent, ground cloth, dehydrated food, clothing.</li> 
<li>Wally Werner, Adventure Cycling Guide (many expeditions), carries his 
group first aid kit on the right side of his bike, because in an emergency he 
knows to lay his bike on the left side (to protect the derailers from the 
ground) and quickly access his first aid kit which is always just under his 
pannier flap. In his case, he's had plenty of practice.</li> 
<li>Generally, pack heavy stuff low, light stuff high (thus lowering the 
center of gravity or keeping it as low as practical). Pack for rapid access to 
rain gear, first aid kit, map, phone, flash light, matches, camera, and wallet 
- no matter where the item is stored. Also, see previous list item.</li> 
<li><b>Note:</b> If there is a Handlebar Bag, some of these items should be 
carried there. Handlebar bags are frequently detached and carried by the biker 
into Museums and other places of interest (where bikes are not allowed). </li> 
<li>Sleeping Bag and sleeping pad on top (because they are light weight).</li> 
<li>All panniers have individual fitting and mounting characteristics, learn 
them. Some panniers clamp with lever, some use a bent metal hook and need 
periodic stretch or shrink adjustments to nylon straps, some attach to and 
detach from special quick connect mounts, some can be secured with a mini 
locking cable.<b>Experience:</b> Remove panniers when transporting bikes on the 
exterior of a vehicle. We had one come off the bike's rack while traveling on a 
rough road and it got run over by a truck</li> 
<li>Pannier racks and bags can have compatibility-fitting issues between the 
bike, bag, rack, and mount - Resolve before purchase or travel. Additionally, 
some pannier racks allow or facilitate a top of rack bag in addition to the 
side mounted bags (which can help balance the load by distributing more weight 
to the front).</li> 
<li>Some Panniers are noisier than others when in motion. Rivets make noise, 
Velcro does not, and plastic buckles tend to be very quiet (assuming one is not 
dragging a loose strap). Metal hooks make noise but can be noise dampened with 
rubber/plastic tube wraps/covers. Also electrical tape or 'duct tape' wraps can 
dampen sound.</li> 
<li>Pannier bag types range from small to large to expedition sized. Most bike 
stores do not carry large expedition bags in stock. Some bags have many pockets 
and access points and some have none. Some are water proof, most are water 
repellent. We have never found this to be an important tour issue but we store 
our items inside a waterproof storage sack first and set the storage sack in 
the pannier. Very often, while camping and remote we leave the panniers mounted 
on the bikes and only bring in the content sacks.</li> 
<li>Some bags are more durable than others. Choose for tour needs and resolve 
all compatibility, fitting, and security issues. Some attach and detach easier 
than others (whose properties can be as problematic as convenient, as some 
easily detachable bags may come off easier as a result of a good pot hole or 
rogue tree branch). Some facilitate external strapping of extra loads, most 
don't.</li> 
<li>Keep DEET and Water Purifier Bleach/Clorox in lowest area in waterproof 
containers (like plastic zip lock type bag) as it can/will leak and destroy 
plastic, nylon, and leather. If one doesn't have a waterproof pannier, its 
better to use waterproof rubber/synthetic storage bags for clothing and for 
anything that needs to be dry. The best sack is the clear plastic storage 
sacks/bags which allow one to see items inside the bag. If, unavailable, then 
Hydroseal type waterproof bags work well (treated nylon with special coated 
material). Waterproof bags are commonly found in kayaking/canoe type boating 
supply stores or online or in larger camping supper stores.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> Things can still get wet in waterproof panniers!</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> Panniers can be stolen and even if the pannier is locked 
or secured, items can be stolen, and if the buckles are secured, a knife can 
open a pannier. We've never had a problem but in populated areas we always have 
an eye on the bikes or the bikes are parked inside an otherwise secure 
building/barn/garage/facility. Luckily, we are usually passing through cities, 
or have a place to stay where the bikes and equipment may be stored, or we park 
next to the ticket booth where an agent agrees to literally watch the bikes 
(and we still chain and lock the bikes and take the handlebar bag(s) containing 
important items and documents with us).</li> 
<li><b>Comment:</b> We are NOT going to suggest where to place the touring 
accruements, but we have evolved a system where we physically place our gear 
pretty much in the same spot for each different trip.</li> <br>

<h3>About Handlebar Bags:</h3> Top 
<p>A Handlebar Bag is a storage device that fits onto the handlebar. It can be 
used to store things that are important to the rider, typical things as large 
as a wallet to things as small as coins or chapstick. The handlebar bag can be 
big or small in size. Probably one of the biggest potential travel benefits of 
a handlebar bag is its ability to hold and display a map, like a miniature 
dashboard. Some touring cyclists do not travel with a handlebar bag; typical 
reasons for not using a handlebar bag are its added travel weight and weight 
added to the front-end steering thus effecting speed, response quickness, and 
maneuverability.</p><br>
 The following are issues to consider for a handlebar 
bag(from our experiences): 
<ul> 
<li>It is important that the handlebar bag mounting hardware be able to attach 
at different angles. Cyclists seem to mount handle bar bags anywhere from Top 
parallel to the ground up to Top at almost 45&deg; (so as to facilitate easier 
or quicker map reading from the saddle).</li> 
<li>It is better to have insertible partitions inside the bag, in order to: 
separate items, hold items upright (so they are easily accessible), and to keep 
small item from sinking underneath all of the bigger items. Better bag systems 
have partitions with Velcro flanges/edges that allow a cyclist to position 
partitions as desired. Beware that some bag system partitions don't attach to 
anything and they are fairly useless.</li> 
<li>Front Pocket</li> 
<li>Side Pockets</li> 
<li>Key holder loops</li> 
<li>Reflective exterior markings</li> 
<li>Generally, the more options that the handlebar bag has, the happier the 
cyclist will be in the long run.</li> 
<li><b>Water Proof</b>: Some handlebar bags are 100% water proof, some are 
water resistant, some have water proof covers. We don't have waterproof 
handlebar bags and it has never been an issue, but we do keep some things in 
their own zip lock type plastic bags on occasion (wallet, passport, and phone). 
Also, sometimes, we keep DEET in a leak proof container (as we had a leaky DEET 
bottle once).</li> 
<li>A <b>bag carry strap</b> is very important and useful for toting the bag 
off the bike. This is a big deal!</li> 
<li><b>CAUTION:</b> Loaded Handlebar Bags make the bicycle top heavy and 
Handlebar Bags are the leading contributor to 'Parked Bike' fall over; be sure 
to read about theBrake Lever Strap. </li> 
<li>Some handlebar bag map cases are mounted by snap-on rivets. These rivets 
may make vibration noises while riding and may be very irritating after a while.
</li> 
<li>Some handlebar bag map systems use Velcro mounting. Velcro mounts are 
quieter for riding and are easier to mount and un-mount.</li> 
<li>On the road, one conducts a lot of map reading with the map in its case, 
mounted or not. The easier it is to remove a map case from a handlebar, the 
better for the cyclist</li> 
<li>A cyclist folds and re-folds the map(s) frequently, as one's track moves 
across the map(s) route over time. Easy map holder access in very important.
</li> 
<li><b>Major handle bar mounting Questions/Issue:</b> How does the bag's mount 
attach to the handlebar?</li> 
<ol> 
<li>Some 'handlebar bag mounts' attach by a wire (like a strap). The wire 
connecting strap system is very secure and does not undo easily (it is a good 
news bad news story). Often the wire strap must be cut in order to remove a 
handlebar bag mount but users of this system never need to remove the mount, 
they just remove the bag). Keep replacement wires handy (not cheap).</li> 
<li>Some 'handlebar bag mounts' attach with clamp systems (using nuts and 
bolts) for fastening. The nut and bolt Clamp method of attachment is more 
serviceable for bike shipping, when the mount must be removed in order to pack 
the handlebar. Thus, the clamp method favors bicycle break-down and re-assembly 
for bike shipping. Keep spare nuts, bolts, and washers handy.</li> </ol> 
<li><b>How does the bag attach to the mount?:</b></li> 
<ol> 
<li>Most bag mounts (bag to bar) allow for quick connect and disconnect and 
this is desirable, so as to remove the bag and carry it into a room, facility, 
tent, museum, ... . On the other hand, the bag should not pop off on its own 
due to riding in rough terrain (which happened to us once).</li> 
<li>Some bag mounts have locks. The handlebar bag is the one item that we 
always detach from the bike to carry into stores, bathrooms, lodging, museums, 
caf&eacute;s, ... . So, note that the lock system has not benefitted us.</li>

<h3>About Bike Trailers (All Trailer Types)<br>
 and Bike Trailer Checklist:
</h3> Top Panniers 
<ul> 
<li>Trailer, clean and all parts functioning appropriately.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> It is difficult to have an unbalanced load on a bike 
trailer, BUT insure that it is balanced AND NEVER have a load that allows the 
tongue to go upward when it is not connected. Each left/right half should weigh 
about the same. Ideally, a super heavy item should be placed centered over the 
axle or as near to the axle as possible.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> A partial trailer load needs to be stored such that it is 
balanced and won't be able to shift - Loads that shift can be dangerous and 
cause a cyclist to lose balance, control, or a vibration resonance.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> Downhill runs and downhill running speeds may facilitate 
or induce some kind of vibration resonance that starts with a trailer wag (like 
a dog's tail wag). If the wag is not brought under control by gently but 
rapidly slowing down, the wag shake force and wag frequency may increase to the 
point of loss of control. First of all, avoid this kind of mechanical behavior; 
slow the bicycle down (under 10 MPH/16 KPH) and stay in control as soon at the 
first hint of tail wag.We learned this the hard way.<br>
 See <b>Successful 
Recovery</b> Following the Note.</li> 
<li><b>Note:</b> The vibration resonance trailer wag issue (just presented 
previously) seems to be more prevalent or more associated with single wheel, 
in-line, trailers that mount to the rear bicycle wheel axle/skewer.</li> 
<li><b>Successful Recovery:</b> This may not work for every situation but this 
has worked for me (learned from motorcycles). If the handlebar starts to wobble 
(a wobble is when the handlebar ends shakes fore and aft while the front wheel 
shakes left and right [effecting steering] where the shakes may occur two or 
more times per second - These shakes seem to be the physics, physical, and 
mechanical result of a tail wag) then physically steering the bicycle in 
slight, little, 'S' patterns while/and gentle braking may help obtain/regain 
control of the bike. Braking only, in a straight line, may/can exacerbate the 
wobble frequency and/or force. My memory seems to recall that front wheel 
braking alone can exacerbate the resonance and that gentle rear wheel braking 
while gentle 'S' turning was more effective. The 'S' driving pattern that 
worked for me is about 2 or 3 feet, left and right of an imaginary straight 
line track (track being the normal course where one proceeds as desired).</li> 
<li> <b>Warning - Bicycle Handling Skill:</b> If a person locks their arm 
muscles, while holding the handlebars while moving/riding/cycling, to the point 
that there is no absorption of road/bicycle vibration, then a person can cause 
a front wheel steering wobble. This steering wobble, if allowed to continue, 
can result in a loss of steering control. It happens that this same mechanical 
issue can happen in aircraft. This same issue is taught to some pilots in 
flight school, especially to helicopter pilots. There are two important points 
to learn from this physics anomaly. One, riding tense with tight grips can 
cause problems, and two, if a person is in one of those tail wag situations, 
then recovery requires a more gentle grip on the handle bar (as opposed to a 
locked 'Death Grip').</li> 
<li>Check each end of the Trailer Mount (Bicycle and Trailer). Assure that a 
snug dirt free clean fit exists. Lubricate as may be appropriate but wipe off 
any excess. Consider the appropriateness of having a spare coupling, skewer, 
pins, or mount device.</li> 
<li>A spare bicycle chain may be in order, depending on tour distance, 
duration, and type<b>Caution:</b> Bicycle Chains wear out twice as fast when 
towing trailers!</li> 
<li><b>Waterproof Trailer Bag.</b> If a cyclist doesn't have a waterproof 
Trailer bag then use waterproof DrySeal or plastic/rubber bags for clothing and 
anything that needs to be dry. Clear plastic bags allow a traveler to see items 
inside the bag - available at Canoeing and Kayaking stores (online too).</li> 
<li><b>Foam Pad (or Thin Plywood or Thin Counter Top Laminate)</b> to protect 
the Trailer Bag or other Gear from wear. Some trailers have a metal screens 
that after a while cause wear on gear or bag covers. It is a weight reduction 
measure (by the mfgr) that puts a burden on the cyclist to guard for gear wear. 
Wood and Laminate will last longer and foam has to be inspected every now and 
then for wear patterns.</li> 
<li>Bicycle Kick-Stand or something similar. Issue, Trailer/Bike Support Notes
</li> 
<li>Trailer Tire Spare Inner Tube(s)</li> 
<li>Three Metal Tire Tool/Lever Bars (as a minimum: one metal tool and two 
plastic)<b>Assumption:</b> Tire Changing Tools and Kit are available (listed 
under previous Bike checklist segment)</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Tire removal is very difficult on trailers because the 
tire is smaller and fits much tighter on the tire rim. Therefore metal tire 
tools may be needed (so they don't break).</li> 
<li><b>Experience:</b> We broke a plastic tire tool/lever, and most are 
plastic, while removing a trailer tire to fix an inner tube flat. It was a 
little cool morning (about 45&deg;F) but in any case the tire removal activity 
was extremely difficult. We now have metal tire changing tools used just for 
trailer tire removal.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Metal tire tools are much more likely to puncture or 
damage an inner tube than plastic tools.</li>

<h3>Trailer Tongue Collar:</h3> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> <b>Directions for making Styrofoam Trailer Tongue Collar(s):</b> When the 
styrofoam wrap is attached to the trailer tongue, it keeps the trailer hitch 
connector off the ground and therefore out of the dirt.<br>
<br>
 We took a 
child's styrofoam swimming noodle, in our case colored lime green, and cut two 
segments (for each bike) into four inch lengths, using a regular saw. Yes, it's 
messy, read on. Then we cut a diagonal cut on one side all the way into the 
hollow. In this manner, the styrofoam collar may be attached and removed from 
the suitcase trailer tongue. A butane lighter was used to melt the rough cut 
edges - Be careful, its easy to light the styrofoam on fire and the flame is 
nearly invisible (a person can hear it burning but may not see it burning). We 
additionally learned to wrap a thick rubber band (or two) around the styrofoam 
tube to help keep the styrofoam collar on the trailer tongue. The rubber band 
is a requirement. The only travel issue that we have had is that the styrofoam 
collar may slide down the tongue toward the suitcase - it sort of does not 
matter while towing the trailer on the bike, but just before disconnecting the 
trailer from the bike, insure that the styrofoam collar is near the coupler - 
the best place is right over the rubber coupler bolt.<b>HIDDEN BENEFIT:</b> 
These same Collars can be used on the Handlebar when packing the bike or for 
carrying in a travel bag - It helps prevent handlebar rubbing/scratching.<b>
CAUTION:</b> When a trailer is carried in the back of a vehicle these Styrofoam 
wraps can break free and fly away.<b>NOTE:</b> Over time, the styrofoam 
compresses and the rubber band(s) become more important.</ul><br>

<ul> <b>Home made Trailer Yoke Splash Shield</b> made for the mounting yoke of 
a BOB Yak. The shield is part of a segment of metal chimney stove pipe (already 
pre-curved). Tools used were a hammer, pliers, and aluminum (grayish) looking 
spray paint (for finished product). It is mounted with electrical conduit 
brackets, that are shaped like the letter &quot;P&quot;, using very short 
carriage bolts, small washers, lock washers, and plastic locknuts.</ul><br>

<br>
<b>Please Note</b> that there are many times <i>when, if 
one asks if one can carry a bike on public transportation, the answer will be 
&quot;NO.&quot;</i> So that a cyclist won't be stranded somewhere, it is often 
best to not ask. If the driver asks about what's in the bag, then the answer 
should be &quot;it is equipment&quot; or &quot;sporting equipment&quot; (bikes 
are sport equipment, a person just don't say or show what kind of equipment it 
is and the cyclist keeps the bike enclosed and sealed).

<h3>Night Lighting (Bike or Helmet; Head, Tail, or Other; Blinking or Steady, 
Battery or Generator):</h3> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>We generally do NOT leave our bike light on the bike during daylight hours 
for mountain trails or rough dirt roads but we often leave lights mounted for 
road tours. In cities, it is a security issue (bike accessories like lights and 
pumps seem to dissapear in cities). On trails it is a wear issue (mounted 
lights have more frequent breakdowns). Therefore, we may store the lights.</li> 
<li>Make an effort to know where the bike light(s) is(are) located (when not 
mounted).</li> 
<li>If the lighting device is constantly falling out/off of the bike, then be 
looking for a better/newer system. Bicycle lighting is worthy of a quality 
investment.</li> 
<li>When camping we carry a separate two AA battery camp/tent light that hangs 
or stands easily (for tent/camping) - this same light expands into lantern mode 
(from beam mode).</li> 
<li>Some people only use their bike light and accept the tent lighting 
inconveniences. Having camped like that, we once discovered that a light shined 
into a styrofoam cup will radiate light like a lantern - it is the only 
positive thing about styrofoam that we know (for the record, we found the cup).
</li> 
<li>Always have night lighting for a bike on a tour. One never knows what 
events will conspire to have a person or persons driving into the dark evening.
</li> 
<li>Generally, no one likes driving at night, because that usually means 
something untoward happened during the day. Almost everyone who has a few tours 
under their belt, even short duration tours, has a hard luck story that caused 
them to have to arrive somewhere by bicycling at night.</li> 
<li>There are times when some people want to drive at night (other than just 
for fun or for some night time bike event). Those times are usually weather or 
climate related (i.e.:, crossing a desert or hot arid plane, cooler 
temperatures, head wind days, calmer weather, ...).</li> 
<li>Some people need more light than others. We have found the simple battery 
inside the LED light device (vs separate battery) mounted on the 
handlebar/steer tube/fender to be quite sufficient for touring, both for seeing 
and for being seen.</li> 
<li>Some bikes and/or people prefer generator systems. In the negative, there 
may be generator/tire wear issues, alternating dimness/brightness issues, and 
wiring integrity issues. In the positive, there are no battery charge issues.
</li> 
<li>Tail light(s) are a wise investment and may be legally required. We once 
had lost a mounted headlight and could not find our stored flashlight, so we 
removed the red lens cover of the tail light to use it for a camp/tent light - 
now, most tail lights have red LCD bulbs.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> For some unknown reason, it seems that red tail light lens 
covers are easily lost while biking and especially while transporting bikes. We 
have learned, over time, to pack our front and rear lights away and break them 
out only for road use. It may be wise to duct tape the lens caps (small strips 
along the seam).</li> 
<li>Reflectors and Safety: Many bikers remove the factory reflectors, we 
don't. In addition, all of the reflective material on the saddle bags and 
clothing help with making a biker much more visible at night. Consider carrying 
a reflective triangle (on person or equipment). Making one's self visible 
during the day or night will probably save one's life, more than once.</li> 
<li>There are places where having a blinking head light, blinking tail light, 
or strobe light on a bike at night is Against the Law - Please know that there 
is a difference between having a blinking light on a bike, versus having a 
blinking light on a person.</li> 
<li>Head/helmet mounted lights are becoming more popular. The advantage is 
that everywhere a person looks is lit up. The disadvantage is when a person 
looks at other people it diminishes or ruins the other person's night vision 
capability.</li> 
<li>When riding with other bikers, blinking tail lights are quite an annoyance 
and distraction - run on steady. Head\/helmet mounted lights are quite an 
annoyance and distraction, especially when looking at a person or riding 
directly behind another bike as the constant light bobbing and mirror 
reflections are particularly fatiguing and stressful to fellow riders - get 
some distance and avoid directing light beams into other people's faces.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Bungee/Cargo Net:</h3> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>The Bungee Cargo Net is handy for keeping a raincoat handy or temporarily 
storing anything.</li> 
<li>The Bungee Net is worth taking on a bike tour where the tour company 
supplies the bikes.</li> 
<li>Be aware that there are (at least) two kinds of Bungee Nets:</li> 
<ol> 
<li>One kind of Bungee Net has two mounting/connecting hooks and is meant to 
drape over a front or<b>Rear Rack</b> and/or <b>Pannier</b> from one side to 
the other (typically hooking at the bottom of the rack's frame).</li> 
<li>The other common kind of Bungee Net has four mounting hooks and it is 
typically used on top of a<b>Trailer</b> and typically is mounted as a square 
or a diamond cover pattern.</li> </ol> </ul><br>

<h2>Navigation, Destination, Places of Stay:</h2> Top 
<ul> 
<li>Never count on getting a map at the destination. <i>It is rumored that 
Columbus likely sailed with existing maps of portions of the New World!</i></li>
<li>One can use Yellow Highlighter on colorfast printed maps (printed by 
professional printers; for a few dolars more, some computer printer inks are 
colorfast). In some cases one may want to use a different colored highlighter 
as sometimes the color hides information written in the highlighter's color. 
Highlighter can be removed with Clorox Bleach and a cotton swab (allow time for 
drying, usually about four hours, on tours perform the bleach-swabbing before 
night and the map will be dry by morning).</li> 
<li>When planning or scoping a route on a map, consider writing/indicating key 
change/mileage/distance points on the map itself, especially when Map Keys or 
Information Boxes are hidden away by map folding. When one is in the moment on 
a bicycle tour, one is not likely to stop and fully open a map and read Keys or 
Information Boxes that are beyond the fold (but sometimes one must - poor map 
design).On Adventure Cycling's bicycle route maps, we indicate route mileage 
points next to the stars (course changes) so that we can more quickly match the 
map's key information to a particular map point - this is very handy when 
actually touring on a bike.</li> 
<li><b>Navigation Lessons:</b> In Old World cities and some older New World 
European founded cities, street names may not be continuous, many streets or 
highways are not marked, or destination signage may not exist. Thus, the 
following navigation scenarios exist:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Old town street names are often, only, for three or four block segments.
</li> 
<li>Streets can bend or dog leg.</li> 
<li>Intercepting a street by taking a short cut can lead to: 
<ol> 
<li>Miss-direction due to unexpected or uncharted street direction changes.
</li> 
<li>Missing the street because it does not extend beyond a few blocks.</li> 
</ol> </li> 
<li>In a one kilometer distance on a more or less straight street, an old city 
street may have six or more different street names. Also:
<ul> 
<li>Street naming has usually resulted from town growth over a period of time 
(measured in centuries).</li> 
<li>Very often the buildings with the same street name are from the same 
century or growth era.</li> 
<li>The dwelling's architectural age is noticeably older as one approaches the 
oldest part of the town.</li> 
<li>To make matters even more interesting, the oldest centers of old towns 
have often burned down a couple of times in the most recent one thousand years 
(and may have the newest looking buildings).</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Street Names may only be posted at one spot (where a biker may not know or 
ever find) or the street names may not be posted at all.</li> 
<li>Some streets in older neighborhoods may be one way streets (created from 
necessity because of their narrowness as well as the congestion caused by city 
growth.</li> 
<li>Advertising and destination signage are often not allowed. As a navigator 
a traveler must be familiar with map reading and relative positioning.</li> 
<li><b>Road Signs:</b> 
<ul> 
<li>Outside of North America a road sign, with a turn arrow or a road turnoff 
for an approaching Street or City, does not necessarily mean that the turn is 
the very next road turnoff. This is especially true for a sign in a city placed 
in front of a minor street. The sign just means that the street turnoff is 
coming soon, it may be the next street or a following street, or the turn may 
be within a couple hundred meters.</li> 
<li>As a navigator, one must be flexible and able to cross reference a turn 
with other relative aids (like street names, destination town names, road 
position, map validation, ...).</li> 
<li>Road navigation is especially an issue for the back roads of Europe and 
for inner Village street navigation.</li> 
<li>In some of these old towns that are centuries old, we've learned to look 
at the wear patterns of the street to determine the main throughway.</li> 
<li>Signage for turnoffs is problematic in old towns.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Travelers may not get road crossing warnings for road or highway turn 
offs. The road intersection may just appear and may not be marked.</li> </ul> 
<li>When one is cycling and there are one or more road side tables and/or rest 
areas, learn to take advantage of these facilities for rest/snack breaks. Just 
as important, by observation, the existence of these facilities usually implies 
that no commercial establishments are in proximity. Conversely, where there are 
no road side tables or rest areas, that generally implies that a commercial 
establishment is nearby nor coming soon. Of course road side rest areas are 
designed and spaced for automobile traffic and traffic speeds, like 50 miles 
apart or one hour apart at automobile speed, and on bicycles an entire touring 
day can happen in 50 miles.</li> 
<li>Being lost (or suffering through a lack of map and landmark match-up) is 
an opportunity to ask for help and meet interesting people. We have never been 
mistreated or mislead and local peoples love to help outsiders on bikes. We've 
met some really interesting people in this manner and we've had some excellent 
off the beaten path sightseeing and restaurant recommendations.</li> 
<li>Some buildings, structures, and dwellings are so old or well known that 
they don't have a formal postal address, its just X House, X Farm, X Mill, X 
Monument, or X Castle. The locals have known where the place was located for 
centuries and there may not be any local signage. A map may not have the 
location marked accurately either (an X just north of town when its actually 
located south or west of town). Be Flexible and enjoy the little curves that 
touring throws, it's all character developing!</li> 
<li>Thanks to the cell phone, it is not unusual to call the destination 
location shortly before the expected arrival time to get specialized final 
directions.This is especially helpful to bicyclists who are often at the end of 
a long day and may not want to expend or even have the energy for being lost or 
for back tracking. We've had caring hosts, for unexpected late night arrivals, 
voluntarily stand in the road so that we would not miss their location. We have 
also missed destination places because we expected signage or lights to be 
turned on at night.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Some caring proprietors will (insistently) offer to 
lock/secure the bicycle(s) in a storage room, for your safe keeping. This is 
good, well meaning, and for your security and the proprietor's protection. 
However, the managers are often the only person with a key. The<i>potential 
problem</i>, based on experience, is that managers often show up just at 
breakfast time or check out, which is often at 8 or 9 AM. So, cyclists in these 
situations need to make any early departure desires known to the manager - 
managers will always accommodate the cyclist's needs, often we have been given 
the manager's key. This is particularly an issue in hot climates or hot days 
where the cyclist(s) must have an early morning start. PS, don't be surprised 
to find that one is parking their bike next to the owner's Mercedes or BMW.</li>
<li>If a traveler is going to be late and there are reservations, call the 
destination facility and let them know the travel status. This act is greatly 
appreciated at the other end and it keeps them from worrying about the traveler 
or their fare and it may allow them to get an early dinner or perform last 
minute tasks.</li> <br>

<li><b>About Using the Sun for Navigation:</b><br>
 If the sun is out, one can 
learn to tell direction with a little sun position and sun travel knowledge. 
One's knowledge is greatly enhanced if they have a watch (timepiece). For 
simplicity's sake, we're only addressing navigation in the Northern Hemisphere, 
north of the Tropic of Cancer. The same logic works for the Southern 
Hemisphere, south of the Tropic of Capricorn.<i>The voice in Italics is our 
Tenderfeet Boy Scouts, average age 12.</i> Play along.</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Sun Position and Navigation Facts 101:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>The earth rotates 360&deg; per day (24 hours) - <i>Borrring</i></li> 
<li>The earth rotates 15&deg; per hour - <i>OK, this is interesting</i></li> 
<li>The Sun always rises in the East and sets in the West (no matter which 
hemisphere).<i>Duh</i></li> 
<li>When the Sun is at its highest point in the sky, it is both, noon for that 
particular spot, and an imaginary line between the Sun and the closest point on 
the horizon forms a perfect North-South line.<i>Interesting</i></li> 
<li>The sun crosses the sky in an elongated arc across the sky, from East to 
West<i>OK</i></li> <br>

<li>It takes just about the same amount of time and arc distance for the sun 
to rise to its highest point as it takes to go from the highest point to set.<i>
This has possibilities.</i> Keep in mind that there is a difference between 
high noon at a particular spot and 12:00 O'clock noon on a watch.<i>Oh?</i> A 
Watch's Time is set to a time zone so that many nearby locations may operate 
from common and shared clock time.BTW, the difference between the local time 
zone and an exact spot on earth is, and must be, addressed by astronomers in 
Local Sidereal-Time and Solar-Time. <i>Cool</i></li> 
<li>On any particular day, when sun shadows are at their shortest, that shadow 
is pointing north (because the sun crosses the sky in an arc across the 
southern sky). Also, it is noon for that spot.<i>Again, with the time stuff.</i>
</li> </ul> <br>

<li><b>Navigation Reasoning Factors</b> (AKA Deductive Reckoning or DED 
Reckoning):</li> 
<ul> 
<li>It really helps to understand a Compass:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>A compass has 360&deg; (for that matter, any Circle).</li> 
<li>North is at 0&deg; which is the same as 360&deg;, East is at 90&deg;, 
South is 180&deg;, West is 270&deg;.</li> 
<li>Here's a mental exercise (we actually play this game with Scouts; it helps 
build a mental global positioning image).<br>
- You are facing East. Which way 
is North? &lt;one should be pointing to left side&gt;.<br>
- You are facing 
Southwest. Which way is Northwest? &lt;should be pointing to right side&gt;.<br>
In the game with Scouts, everyone gets a turn in the middle using different 
directions.<br>
Next challenge level.<br>
- You are facing 270&deg;. Which way 
is South and how many degrees is it?<br>
&lt;South is to the left and it is 
180&deg;&gt;. This is a little tough on 12 year olds because it is Trigonometry 
and most of them are just starting basic Algebra. Heck, it's tough on grown-ups 
too.<br>
- The sun is at 180&deg;. You are not facing the Sun, we need to be 
travelling Northeast. Which way is it and how many degrees is that on a 
compass? Mental math occurs here. &lt;It's over the left shoulder when one is 
facing South and the heading is 45&deg;&gt;. Pat yourself on the back and 
welcome to basic navigation.</li> </ul> 
<li>Understanding where the sun rises and sets helps us to Navigate in the 
mornings and evenings.<i>Oh yeah, we get it, but what about midday.</i></li> 
<li>If one were to face the sun at noon, one would be facing South. <i>OK, OK, 
but what about the other times of the day?</i></li> 
<li><b>The typical human closed fist (balled fist, no outward thumb) held 
upright at full arm extension, covers about a 7 to 8&deg;Arc,</b> so two fists 
equals about 15&deg;Arc (see where this is going). 15&deg;Arc equals about 1 
hour of earth rotation time (even in the winter, there's just less sun light in 
the day). *Remember; don't use the thumb at all in making your fist. This 
method gets a little funky when measuring from the horizon to directly overhead 
without the use of some object like a tree or building (to help mark the Fist 
counts) but guess what, there's another method for noon stuff.<i>OK. Now what?
</i></li> <br>
<b>Here's a useful Fist Measure* reference table:</b> 
<ul> 
<li>1 Fist ~ 7~8&deg; or 30 minutes of relative Sun Travel (actually the earth 
rotates)</li> 
<li>2 Fists ~ 15&deg; or 1 hour</li> 
<li>3 Fists ~ 24&deg; or 1.5 hours</li> 
<li>4 Fists ~ 30&deg; or 2 hours</li> 
<li>5 Fists ~ 37&deg; or 2.5 hours</li> 
<li>6 Fists ~ 45&deg; or 3 hours</li> </ul> 
<li>We can use our Fist Knowledge to tell Time and to Navigate. <i>This is 
Cool, but what's with all the time stuff.</i> We can use our fist to project 
ahead or behind the Sun's relative direction to estimate time or direction. for 
example, say that it's about 2:00 PM (1400 Hours), we can count 4 fists 
backwards from the Sun to find the 180&deg; due south line and then make easy 
heading direction plans from there.<i>Awesome!</i></li> <br>

<li><b>Here's an example of <i>Interpolation</i></b>. Let's say that sunrise 
comes up at 6 AM. We have a map, a route to travel that requires a Northwest 
heading, but we don't have a compass. It is now 9 AM (about half way between 
sunrise and high noon - Remember that the highest point of the sun in the sky 
is, both, Noon and Due South or 180&deg;). Where would we expect the sun to be.
<i>Ewwww Cooool, it would be in the Southeast!</i> Our heading? <i>Directly 
opposite!</i> I am so proud of you.</li> <br>

<li><b>Sun Position and Navigation Facts 201</b> (What the Celts and Mayans 
Knew):<br>
 We're still discussing navigation skills for the northern 
hemisphere.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>The Sun only rises and sets at true East and West twice a year, on the 
Equinox. The Equinox days are generally March 20 and September 22 (actual dates 
and times vary up to one earth day). The amount of daylight and night are equal 
only on these event dates.</li> 
<li>The Sun reaches its most Northern and most Southern arcs on the Solstice. 
The Northern Solstice is generally on June 21 and the most Southern Solstice is 
generally on December 21.</li> 
<li>The Summer Solstice is the longest day in the Northern Hemisphere and The 
Winter Solstice is the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere</li> 
<li>The earth's tilt angle to the sun is 23.44&deg; (which roughly translates 
to three Fist Measures - hold that thought;The result of the earth's tilt angle 
is indicated in Henges and Sun Temples but it is not likely that the ancients 
made the link to the earth's orbit tilt or even realized that the sun was at 
the center of earth's orbit).</li> <br>

<li>Each day, after the Spring Equinox, the Sun rises and sets a little more 
to the North until it reaches its most northern arc on the day of the Summer 
Solstice. After the Summer Solstice the sun starts to rise and set a little 
more to the south each day, passing through the Equinox and reaching its most 
southern arc on the Winter Solstice.</li> 
<li>The amount of daily Sun rise and set location change is slightly greater 
during the Equinox times and slightly slower for the Solstice times (an effect 
of Spatial Geometry).</li> 
<li>The overall angle between sunrise and sunset locations on the horizon form 
winter solstice to summer solstice is 46.9&deg; (23.4&deg; north of an 
east-west line to 23.4&deg; south of an east-west line - also a total of six 
fists); This is significant and worthy of attention when conducting DED 
Reckoning.</li> 
<li>During Navigation calculations for the morning and evening, perform your 
own interpolation considering the following (Generally):</li> 
<ul> 
<li>March and September: add -5&deg; to 5&deg; north (depending on which side 
of the Equinox date)</li> 
<li>April and August: add 5&deg; to 15&deg; north</li> 
<li>May and July: add 15&deg; to 20&deg;</li> 
<li>June: add 20&deg; to 23&deg; north</li> <br>
</ul> A similar chart could 
be made for the winter months (or for Summer in th the Southern hemisphere), 
with the sun rising and setting south of the East-West line.</ul> 
<li><b>Sun Position and Tropical Land Navigation 301</b>:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>There are nearly always 12 hours of sunlight in the Tropics (between the 
Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). On the equator itself, actual 
sunrise and sunset time differences are measured in minutes and near the Tropic 
lines, the sunrise and sunset time differences can approach an hour and a few 
minutes.BTW, Tidal activity is very minuscule between the Tropic Arcs - Tidal 
effects increase as one heads toward the poles.</li> 
<li>The time of sunrise and sunset may shift, based on location North or South 
within the tropics.</li> 
<li>The Sun still rises in the East and sets in the West.</li> 
<li>Fist counts work very well for time calculations. Mornings and evenings 
are easier to calculate than in the mid day. Measurements at mid day can be 
taxing and difficult.</li> 
<li>One must know the Date (which implies the time of the year, for which one 
should generally know that Sun is heading further north or further south for 
the daily sunrise and sunset).</li> 
<li>Depending on where one is located, the midday stick shadow may point south 
or north or not exist at all. On the June Solstice the stick shadow will either 
not exist or it will point south. It is just the opposite for the December 
Solstice, the stick shadow will either not exist or it will point north.</li> 
<li>Noontime still occurs at the shortest shadow of a straight stick, only now 
there may be no shadow at all at noon time.</li> 
<li>It takes about 15 minutes of time to determine a good East-West line (in 
lieu of other signs of nature, not discussed here); field expedient E-W lines 
can be made in 2 or 3 minutes.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Place a stick in the ground at a deliberate angle (usually 45-60&deg; to 
the earth).</li> 
<li>We're watching the tip of the stick's shadow, the sharper the better. Mark 
it with something small and identifiable that won't blow away.</li> 
<li>The tip of the shadow will move East as the sun travels West.</li> 
<li>In about 15 minutes, Mark the shadow point, again, with a different small 
object.</li> 
<li>The line formed is an East-West line.</li> 
<li>The last mark is due East. Ergo, facing East, North is on the left and 
South is on the right, and West is behind.</li> </ul> Remember, <b>the advantage
</b> of determining an East-West Line is to tell direction by inference. Take 
advantage of the directional knowledge by facilitating landmarks to help one 
maintain a more or less straight/directed line of travel (or else, one will end 
up traveling 300 yards/meters in dense foliage and be forced to take 
measurements again - line up trees, rocks, or hill tops to assist in 
maintaining a visual straight line of travel). Remember, when facing East, 
North is to the Left and South is to the Right.</ul> 
<li><b>Compass Information 501</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>The North and South Magnetic Poles are not at the same place as the 
Earth's rotational axis poles. Therefore one has to address deviational 
differences between compass readings and directions and true North-South earth 
grid (longitude and latitude) readings and directions.</li> 
<li>Every ten-thousand years or so, due to a flux of molten iron inside the 
earth's core, the magnetic fields do a flip-flop (South to North and North to 
South). The Sun performs a magnetic pole flip-flop every eleven years and it is 
associated with strong sun spot activity and solar flares. We don't really know 
the effect that such a change will have on Earth.</li> 
<li>Chinese compasses orient southward, while most of the rest of the world 
orients northward. This may not have any meaning but some people suspect that 
the Chinese, whose civilization had and studied the compass before any other 
known civilization, may have had a compass before the last magnetic pole change 
on earth.</li> 
<li>Many magnetic field specialists think that the earth is due for a magnetic 
pole change now or they feel that such a change is imminent. No one knows how 
it will affect earth and navigation on earth. Many feel that there will be a 
period (a month?) of mixed up regional variations and weak compass readings, 
maybe like a hundred regional north and south pole readings. Luckily, major 
airlines and ships use GPS navigational systems so the impact of a magnetic 
change is probably greatly reduced.</li> </ul> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>About Round-Abouts (aka Circle Navigation and Survival):</h3> Top 
<ul> 
<li>So far, for us, the major round-about's have had signs that show which 
road radial is the desired exit. Learn to look for and quickly study the sign 
to learn the desired exit/turn by count, by name, and by road number because 
there are often five or six spokes and the foreign language can make it 
difficult to understand all factors, plus the exit itself may only have one of 
the exit clues (highway number or next town name). The place to stop and get 
one's mind and group together is at or before the sign (not inside the circle). 
Quick studies only work if the cyclist knows where one is located (road 
name/number wise) and where one is going (by road name and by city). Knowing 
where one is usually comes from a prior map consultation. The next city listed 
on a sign for a circle may not be the destination city/town/village name - 
again, it helps to know one's map position/location.</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>In multi lane traffic,</b> no matter left or right side driving traffic 
rules, the next exit is always the outside lane and through traffic is the 
inside lane.</li> 
<li><b>Circles with more than four arteries or more than two lanes</b> are 
problematic. Those circles usually have signage. The main issues are:</li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Other Drivers Want to Know Where a Cyclist is Heading:</b> Point in the 
direction that one needs to go, but don't point in a manner that makes it look 
like a turn signal. We usually<i>point a little skyward (like up at a 25&deg; 
to 30&deg; angle) and move the hand and arm inward and outward in line with the 
direction (such that the elbow is moving in and out of 180&deg; to 90&deg; 
angles).</i> Usually 2 or 3 repetitions communicates the need (and its hard to 
drive and signal at the same time).</li> 
<li><b>The Cyclist is in the Incorrect Lane and Needs to Change:</b> <i>Start 
pointing 45&deg; downward</i> toward where the cyclist needs to be - other 
drivers will let the biker in. The cyclist actually points to the spot that one 
need to be. Always express appreciation - We either give a head nod of thanks 
and/or mouth or say the word for &quot;Thank You&quot; and/or we give a hand 
wave.</li> 
<li><b>The Cyclist is in the Correct Lane and Needs to Change:</b> If one is 
in the correct lane but needs to change, then<i>use a combination signal and 
hand-finger pointing method.</i> No one cares which arm is used for signaling. 
Most people know that its harder to signal and pedal at the same time, just 
don't be too brief in the signal, other people are busy too.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>In light traffic in small towns</b> we follow the normal rules of 
etiquette, to include proper lane selection, but nine times out of ten, 
everyone one else usually yields to a biker in the circle. We try not to pause, 
or it messes up the smooth flow of the other traffic. If a car stops for us, 
even though it had the right away, we go. One must pay attention, but we find 
auto driver behavior to be consistent.</li> </ul> Outside of the USA, there is 
a deep respect for touring bicyclists.</ul> <br>

 Among 
bikers they are called 'Computers' or 'Travel Computers'.<br>
<br>

<dd> <b>LEARNING LESSON:</b> We went on a self guided tour in Sicily. <b>We 
were given travel instructions in 100% written text and symbols.</b> The entire 
seven day tour was in written instructions in a written table (tabular format) 
that had 'Leg Distance', 'Total Distance', 'Travel Instruction', and sometimes 
a 'Tour Note'. Distances were in the decimal tenths or hundredths, like 5.64 K 
(Kilometer) or 264.4 M (Meters). The only map distributed was an Automobile Map 
of the entire island (which only had major towns and major roads listed, not 
all of the incremental villages nor back roads).</dd> <br>

<dd> <b>Issues with Only Text/Written Directions:</b> 
<ol> 
<li>Each subsequent direction can be based on getting the predecessor 
direction correct.</li> 
<li>A few people, especially those with a touch of lesdyxia, are prone to 
reading errors.</li> 
<li>Most people will have reading-meaning interpretation problems at some 
point.</li> 
<li>This is why the expression, 'a picture is worth a thousand words'.</li> 
</ol> </dd> 
<dd> <b>We were caught off guard and the reader will probably appreciate 
knowing about this incident:</b> <br>
 Our Italian Setup Guide acted shocked 
that we did not have a bike computer. We were shocked that no one had told us 
that is was a requirement [we brought our own bikes and packed from their 
checklist]. A bike computer was not even a site recommendation for items to 
bring. We were shocked that the instructions were only in text. There was 
absolutely NO indication that the touring instructions would be in text, 
otherwise we would have bought a bicycle computer. At the time of this writing 
(2007), good computers run $25-50 (USD) and simple computers are available for 
$15. We would have been quite happy to have a simple computer. We were not even 
offered a bicycle computer to buy, borrow, or rent. Furthermore, we just left a 
very big city where we could have purchased such an item. We've been touring 
for decades and have never used anything but a map or a series of maps.</dd> 
<dd> To our credit and the instructions credit, we never got lost and we maybe 
missed two turns. We did read and re-read the instructions often and we had to 
make a few communal decisions about the word/travel meanings sometimes (but 
these things are healthy and build character). The Tour, itself, was still a 
good tour and we thoroughly enjoyed the Sicilian people and experience.</dd> 
<dd> <b>Addendum (2009):</b> More and more Bicycle Touring Companies are 
offering GPS tools for navigation assistance. Another advantage of a Tour 
Company issuing a GPS is that the cycling company can hide some of the routing 
details and secrets from competing vendors - We have signed non-disclosure 
agreements for some operators.</dd> </ul><br>

<h2>Camping and Outdoor Travel Issues</h2> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>At all times, on the road or in camp, a cyclist should be able to quickly 
find the following items:
<ul> 
<li>Knife,</li> 
<li>First Aid Kit,</li> 
<li>Lighter or Water Proof Matches,</li> 
<li>Flash Light (Torch),</li> 
<li>Spare Batteries, and</li> 
<li>Rain Protection Gear.</li> </ul>These items and their location should be 
known while they are on the bike as well as in the tent or in the detached 
handlebar bag (carried into museums and such).</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>Choosing a Campsite:</b><br>
In a perfect campsite selection world, one 
wants to be up hill on a gentle slope, on smooth water adsorbent ground, out of 
the wind or blowing rain, not near a lightning rod, and located where the sun 
will shine first thing in the morning.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid high ridge lines as these areas attract lightning.</li> 
<li>Avoid areas with lightning scarred trees.</li> 
<li>Avoid dense brush/growth areas as there is no way to stop a fast moving 
fire (started nearby).</li> 
<li>If there are many trees avoid the tall ones. If there are a few trees 
avoid them but consider using the shade. Avoid bird hangouts (for poop and 
noise). Avoid sap dripping trees, and avoid lightning attractors.</li> 
<li>Where is the rain going to go? Don't pitch a tent at any low point, river 
bed, gully, depression, drain channel, or flash flood area/plain.</li> 
<li>In camp grounds find out where the sprinkler heads are located, don't set 
up on top of or next to a sprinkler head.</li> 
<li>Where one has a choice, avoid windy areas, use natural wind blocks 
(bushes, trees, boulders, buildings).</li> 
<li>Learn or figure where the food will be stored: 1) NOT in the Tent, 2) Bear 
Vault, 3) Bear Bag. Don't put the tent under the Bear Bag location.</li> 
<li>On gentle slopes arrange the tent length inline with the downhill run (not 
sideways to the slope). Most experienced campers will align the entrance at the 
bottom of the slope (versus the top of the slope or sideways to the slope).</li>
<li>No matter where the tent entrance is, the sleeping bags must be inline 
with the downhill run (sometimes called fall-line) and the heads at the uphill 
end (or else bodies will slide into each other over the course of the night or 
blood will rush/pool at head).</li> 
<li>Usually the first thing one does when pitching a tent is place stakes into 
the ground, 1, to hold it in place, and 2, rationalize the layout. Never setup 
a tent without staking at least one corner (usually four) or one may discover 
what is meant by the term<b>Maytag</b> (the tent blows away and tumbles 
everything inside -<b>Murphy's Law:</b> tumbling tents are attracted to water 
or cliffs).</li> 
<li>If one is in a remote area next to a water source (pond, creek, ...), 
don't pitch a next to the water: it scares wild game that need access to the 
water and it is generally ugly (spiritually and literally).</li> 
<li>In campgrounds, try to not be next door to the latrine, store, shower, or 
next to major walk ways; avoid groups that drink alcohol, play/sing music, or 
are loud.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>About Stealth Camping:</b> </li> 
<ul> 
<li>Stealth Camping is described as 'Camping in a location where the legal 
status of camping is unknown.'</li> 
<li>Only Experienced Cyclists, Campers and Travelers should attempt stealth 
camping.</li> 
<li>The practice is most common among Solo Bikers and on occasion by 
Couple/Pair Bikers.</li> 
<li>The situation is that the cyclists, for whatever reason, are caught at 
sundown (or near sundown) in an area that has no known hotel, place of lodging, 
or campground.</li> 
<li>There are no signs specifying public or private property.</li> 
<li>There are no signs prohibiting camping or resting.</li> 
<li>There is no way for a cyclist to tell if one is on BLM land, 
open/undesignated county property, state property, Federal property (of another 
type/jurisdiction), or property of any kind (which permits overnight camping).
</li> 
<li>The look of the place may be that perhaps others have camped there before; 
it may be something like an unofficial automobile/truck rest area or a road 
side pull-off/break area - The area may or may not have trash cans.</li> 
<li>There may be a scenic view or pastoral view/feel.</li> 
<li>There may be a car, truck, or camper at the site when a cyclist arrives.
</li> 
<li>On the other hand, the selected area may be 100 yards away from a road, 
fence, visible traffic, or structures.</li> 
<li><b>Stealth Camping Precautions/Warnings:</b> </li> 
<ul> 
<li>The cyclist usually scouts out the place during the remaining daylight, 
but for whatever reason<b>it may be a drop dead-tired emergency rest area 
selected in the middle of darkness.</b></li> 
<li><b>The rider must stop for health reasons to let the body rest and 
recharge itself, hopefully with water and nutrition.</b></li> 
<li><b>Typical or common emergency camp reasons are delays caused by: bike 
repair, bonk, hypothermia/physical/heat exhaustion (inability to think 
clearly), illness, dizziness, injury, injured partner (muscle strain), threats 
and/or road rage from a vehicle driver.</b></li> 
<li>The cyclist usually finds a spot that will be out of the way of any 
motorized traffic pulling off the road and from the view of motorized roadway 
traffic.</li> 
<li>The cyclist may or may not pitch (set up) a tent.</li> 
<li>The cyclist probably will not have visible light nor a visible camp stove 
fire (and definitely NO Campfire).</li> 
<li>Sleeping in the open is common (sleeping bag on top of a space blanket (or 
ground cloth), flashlight and weapon of protection handy). Some Cyclists use 
the waterproof tent cover as a top cover.</li> 
<li>Usually an area is selected that will not likely have auto traffic trough 
it but if that is a concern, place the bikes and anything that reflects light 
between you and the likeliest automobile approach direction. If some other 
vehicle is there, if the situation is right, perhaps ask them to position their 
vehicle to protect you and/or get their approval to use their vehicle as a 
protection barrier.</li> 
<li>A cyclist usually makes arrangements to have a tent strike (take down) 
before first light and maybe have packed the tent in a pannier/trailer by 
sunrise and the cyclist may be cooking or eating breakfast just after sunrise.
</li> 
<li>Before departure: leave no trace, cover/fill any peg holes, and make the 
area look like a 'stealth camper' was never there (and maybe leave the place a 
little better than found).</li> </ul> </ul> 
<li><b>Tent:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Know how to set up beforehand - attach any cords or lines that should 
normally stay with the tent.</li> 
<li>Tents without bottoms are lighter weight.</li> 
<li>Tents that are fully enclosed keep creepy crawlers out.</li> 
<li>The very lightest shelter is a plastic tube. Second lightest is a Bivy 
Sack.</li> 
<li>If away from the area, keep the tent doors and windows closed. This action 
keeps surprise rain, hail, and critters out. If Hot, OK to open windows with 
screens as long the windows are protected from rain or rain is improbable.</li> 
<li>Hydration is extra important to bike riders and backpackers, so one must 
learn to be careful with water bottles in a tent.</li> 
<li>We keep our bottles at the entrance, either just inside the tent or 
outside in the vestibule.</li> 
<li>We always bring in water bottles in the mountains or even if the 
temperatures will reach the 40's F/10's C.</li> 
<li>We keep a &quot;P&quot; Bottle on the other side of the entrance.</li> 
</ul> 
<li><b>Hand Axe, Saw, Hammer/Mallet Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>A device is needed to pound in tent stakes in many places with hard ground 
and no rocks, yet who wants to carry a heavy weight on the trail? A light 
weight plastic tent/stake mallet will suffice in hard terrain.</li> 
<li>Where found in some areas, a four inch hammer stone will work just fine - 
Good campers leave a good stone for the next site user.</li> 
<li>Hand Axes are too heavy to carry (even a weapon argument yields to a light 
weight knife). A foldup or collapsible type camping saw is far more productive 
tool than a hand axe.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Plastic Sheet or Ground Cloth (aka Foot Print)</b>:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Place under the tent bottom, protects tent bottom from wear, keeps 
dirt/mud off tent, allows clean tent folding/packing, for packing - shake and 
the fold ground cloth dirt side to inside.</li> 
<li>In some cases a tent can be rolled up in the ground cloth (clean side to 
the tent). We\'ve done it either way, but very often the sack that the tent 
comes with will not expand wide enough to allow the ground cloth to be rolled 
with the tent - Use experience and judgment here.</li> 
<li>If packing a wet tent (it happens): Fold wet tent inside the ground cloth 
and stop to sun dry the tent at the first opportunity (which is often in the 
mid day sun and it beats waiting for four or five hours for the sun to come 
up). Thus, allowing the cyclists to get moving (if or when desired).</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Sleeping Bag(s):</b> </li> 
<ul> 
<li>At home, always store hung or loose, never store packed or compressed.</li>
<li>All bags need to be unrolled and fluffed at the campsite to be effective 
insulators of warmth.</li> 
<li>Its Not a good idea to stuff tomorrow's clothing in a bag to warn them, 
because body moisture will ruin any insulation benefits.</li> 
<li>When sleeping in a bag, it is unwise to burrow into the bag and breathe 
inside the bag. The moisture from the breath will rob the bag of its insulating 
capabilities.</li> 
<li>In cold air situations, it is very wise to sleep with the head outside of 
the bag and to wear a cap on the head (stocking cap is best). The head hood on 
a mummy bag was invented to serve the purpose of a stocking cap, but many 
people cannot tolerate the total confinement of a mummy bag and prefer open 
square end bags.</li> 
<li>Goose down bags are lighter and compress better than micro fiber bags, 
useless if wet, use river float proof cover, we store in kayak bag). Wet bags 
need immediate attention and can drastically change the joy of a journey.</li> 
<li>Micro fiber bags dry faster than goose down bags (hours vs days, better 
expedition durability &amp; survivability, functional if wet, store in 
waterproof cover/container/bag)</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Sleeping Bag Liner (Optional):</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>There are commercial liners but many people use a folded cotton sheet.</li>
<li>A few sleeping bags have interior tie strings for liners but most don't.
</li> 
<li>Most people use &quot;blanket&quot; size safety pins to connect bag and 
sheet (attach at the seams to prevent cloth tears).</li> 
<li>In the US South or tropical areas, people may use a sheet on top of a 
light weight (summer) sleeping bag or blanket, and maybe crawl into the bag if 
it cools down (and may not want to attach the sheet to anything).</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Sleeping Bag Cover, aka Bivy Sack (Optional):</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>There are GoreTex type covers that facilitate two capabilities. This 
supports an alternate camping style.</li> 
<li>One capability is that a person can sleep in the open, without carrying a 
tent.</li> 
<li>Some covers have little rain flies to protect the head (on flexible hoops 
[best] or by pole and stake).</li> 
<li>Another capability is that sleeping bag covers provide additional 
insulation and warmth and can give some summer type bags usefulness into cooler 
Spring and Fall temperatures.</li> 
<li>The vast majority of sleeping bag covers are for single sleepers, however, 
there are a few designed for two sleepers but the advantages are almost lost 
when compared to a two person tent.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Sleeping Pad:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>The lightest insulator is a cardboard windshield sun screen. Second 
lightest is a plastic-bubble/Mylar (like) automobile windshield sun screen.</li>
<li>The best insulator is a closed cell foam pad. The more foam, the more 
insulation. Foam is heavy, therefore weight/depth trade off compromises exist.
</li> 
<li>The better, interim, ground insulators are thin covered foam pads and self 
inflating foam pads.</li> 
<li>Plastic Air Mattresses absolutely are the worst sleeping pad. If they work 
on the first use, they will spring air leaks within a day or two.</li> 
<li>At home, store foam sleeping pads unrolled and re-plug only after 
obtaining atmosphere equilibrium.</li> 
<li>In the field, to pack, completely roll tightly compressing with the knees, 
and open the valve to let out any air (then replug). Perform the same rolling 
and air squeezing task a second time for tight rolls (for better bag fit).</li> 
<li>In the field, when setting up for the night, allow the pad to self fill. 
After about fifteen minutes of inactivity on the pad, close the valve. One may 
top the mattress off with a couple of breaths and then close the valve but 
avoid wet/moisture breaths, as this may facilitate bacterial growth inside the 
bag over time).</li> 
<li>Couples who are tired of mismatched, always slipping apart pads, may enjoy 
the benefits of a double pad. A double pad is the same weight as two pads, 
bulkier to carry for one person, but the benefit is that the pad never 
separates and most double pads still allow different fill/pressure levels for 
each side.</li> 
<li>Double pads are great for facilitating zip together sleeping bags.</li> 
</ul> 
<li><b>Space Blanket (AKA Emergency Blanket):</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>They Work - Read Instructions.</li> 
<li>It may be used as the ground cloth.</li> 
<li>It may be used as an additional insulating layer between the bags and the 
tent bottom, a common usage in the winter as well as in mountain climates.</li> 
<li>It can be used as a dining fly, but don't use the cooking fly in the tent 
as the food smells may attract unwanted visitors.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Food/Cooking in Tent Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Warning: There is a strong need to NOT cook in, or have food in, the 
tent.</b></li> 
<li>Food smells attract bears, other carnivores, and opportunistic omnivores 
(not only like skunks and raccoons but chip monks and field rats/mice).</li> 
<li>Little omnivores, while people are sleeping or away, can bite or tear 
there way into a tent in order to get to the food. At best, the food supply can 
be contaminated and the food can be replaced, or at worst these food 
destruction activities cause and end to an otherwise nice bicycle tour.<br>
- 
Avoid storing or preparing food in the tent.</li> 
<li>It is wise to set up a cooking area away from the tent. Fifty feet away 
(or more) is recommended but sometimes in some environments twenty-five feet is 
the best available.</li> 
<li>If the weather is bad, cook under the fly, if the weather is good, sit on 
the fly.</li> 
<li>Store food in a Bear Bag or Bear Safe. Bear bags work in remote areas but 
not in areas where bears have a lot of human exposure (like in or near car 
camping areas). So far, Bear Safes have proven to be indestructible. Don't 
forget that toiletries (like mouth wash and toothpaste) and medicines also have 
scents that often attract wildlife - store with the food!</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Miscellaneous:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>The waxy powder of an Aspen tree will provide about a SPF-10 sunblock 
equivalent.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h2>Stoves and Fuel Issues: </h2> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Global Issues</b> (Generalizations with a Few Exceptions):</li> 
<ul> 
<li>In North America, Europe and some Far East areas, <b>Propane/Butane stove 
systems</b> are the standard and typically wood fires are more limited (Not 
Allowed).</li> 
<li>In most of the rest of the world, <b>the most available fuel type is 
Unleaded Gasoline</b> however, in remote Africa, the Middle East (oil poor 
areas), and remote China the indigenous populations typically cook on Alcohol 
Stoves, thus<b>Alcohol can be the primary fuel in some geographic areas</b>.
</li> 
<li>Propane (or other Butane blend) and Unleaded/White-Gas still remain the 
most popular, in that order.</li> 
<li>Most new white gas stoves will burn unleaded petrol (since about 2003), 
but validate.</li> 
<li>As a minimum, if using liquid petroleum stoves, make sure that they burn 
<b>White Gasoline (sometimes called White Gas)</b> as well as <b>Unleaded 
Gasoline (for automobiles</b>, use the Lowest Octane for vehicles) but know 
that some stoves, for a greater purchase cost, can additionally burn<b>Diesel
</b> and <b>Kerosene Fuels</b>. Note that it is <b>the additives, in any liquid 
fuel, that clog up the stove jets</b>.</li> 
<li><b>Coleman Fuel</b> and similarly competing fuels are made from <b>Naphtha
</b>, a grade of oil distillation between gasoline and kerosene (for its 
boiling point) but it<b>is a type of White Gasoline.</b> It happens that <b>
'Coleman'</b> is fairly well known international brand name associated with 
White Gas or Coleman Fuel and the term may be used in remote countries to mean 
White Gas (and not the brand of White Gas/Naptha that Coleman sells). Learn a 
whole lot more aboutWhite Gas, Naphtha and <b>Foreign Terms</b>.</li> 
<li><b>Alcohol</b>, a most underrated cooking fuel. 'Denatured Alcohol' and 
variants like Alcohol 95 or its lower grade/quality alternate Rubbing Alcohol 
or Medicinal Alcohol (NOT the same) are commonly found at Pharmacies (including 
Muslim countries) and/or Hardware, Marine, or Paint Stores (all less common in 
remote areas). Alcohol Stoves can be found online and in larger outdoor stores 
(like REI). While fairly useful Alcohol stoves may be made from aTuna Can (or 
Military MRE Cookie Tin), we suggest sticking with something more industrial 
for global travel. More aboutAlcohol Stoves or Alcohol Fuel - <b>Also see next 
bullet.<br>
Note:</b> This same tin can stove works with Diesel, Kerosene, and 
JP4.</li> 
<li> One pleasant Green thing about Alcohol is that an Organic Sourced Alcohol 
(ethanol, ethyl, pure grain alcohol, medical grade ethanol, medicinal alcohol, 
moonshine [versus fossil fuel]) may come from an organic, renewable, source 
(Distilled Grapes, Fruit, Corn, Wheat, Rice, Millet, Potatoes ...) and usually 
burning organic alcohol does not leave pollutants as severe as some petroleum 
products. Any type of Alcohol does not burn as hot or heat water/food as fast 
as petroleum variants but Alcohol gets the job done.</li> 
<li>A Sterno type stove or 'Sterno Can' may also make a nice backup stove, as 
does a tin-can and some diesel fuel (use only outdoors). Sterno is an alcohol 
variant.</li> 
<li><b>Touring Issue:</b> On camping type tours that are longer than three 
days, it is wise to have two stoves, period. Sometimes we carry a quality main 
and a simple (clamp on the fuel bottle) backup, or we deliberately carry an 
alternate fuel backup system (white gas/unleaded, propane, or alcohol.). Read 
onward for decision indicators.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Issues/Questions to Consider:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Will the traveling take place in one area that consistently has the same 
fuel sources available?</li> 
<li>Will the traveling take place across areas that have different fuel supply 
types (unleaded, white gas, kerosene, diesel; or propane, butane; or alcohol, 
...)?</li> 
<li>Will the traveling take place across areas that have unknown fuel sources?
</li> 
<li>Does one need two stoves that burn the same fuel OR burn different fuels?
</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Solutions/Answers for Stove Selection:</b></li> 
<ol> 
<li>Two identical type stoves, using the same fuel and storage 
bottles/canisters - A most typical solution. There is a lot of merit to having 
two identical stoves (only need one repair kit; no part, piece, or component 
matching issues; they generally handle identically).</li> 
<li>One heavy duty [main stove] and one light duty [backup] that burns the 
same fuel and has the same storage containers - Common for soloists.</li> 
<li>Two stoves of differing fuel types (typically white gas and propane, but 
sometimes white gas and alcohol) - This offers the<b>best risk coverage for 
International Travel</b> but forces one to carry more fuel/weight.</li> 
<li><b>Our Travels:</b> We tend to <b>always carry two stoves</b> that use the 
same fuel and<b>we often use both stoves at cooking time</b> - We own several 
different types of stoves, so our systems familiarity is up to speed. Typically,
<b>in the USA, we use propane stoves,</b> starting a trip with two stoves and 
no less than three fuel canisters (sometimes more, sometimes with partially 
used canisters from previous travels). There is nothing like, plug it in, and 
turn it on for simplicity, especially at the end of a long, wet, uphill climb 
to end a day. We mark canisters (and fuel bottles) with desired usage order 
numbers.<b>Outside of the USA</b> we have rations drop shipped to our 
destination start address (thus avoiding any agricultural import issues for 
fruits, meats, or farm products), we have bought and used self heating rations, 
and<b>we have used Propane Fuel systems</b> (as well as having lived off the 
local economies). We have had fuel delivered at quite a cost, but it was still, 
overall, cheaper than spending a day shopping with many unknown travel 
variables. For us, time is always fixed and limited; we can't change the fixed 
schedule nor change the return day or prepaid flight. We do call and/or email 
logistics arrangements beforehand. We long for the day where we can travel 
somewhere on a flexible and open time schedule.<br>

<li><b>Specific Stove Selection Facts/Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Self supported, experienced, touring cyclists like,<br>
Either:</b></li>
<ul> 
<li><b>Propane stove systems</b> (like Optimus or Primus systems) with a 
detached fuel canister.<br>
- OR -</li> 
<li><b>White/Unleaded-Gasoline pump systems</b> (like Coleman or MSR) with a 
detached pumped fuel bottle.</li> </ul> 
<li>Most <b>self supported bicycle 'Tour Groups'</b> with a paid/hired leader 
in the USA,<b>use two stoves;</b> typically <b>both stoves are combination 
White-Gasoline/Unleaded-Gasoline fuel systems</b> that sit on small attached 
fuel tanks (like the Coleman Exponent).</li> 
<li><b>Expedition Tour Group Leaders</b> prefer heavy duty, durable, and 
relative simplicity over light duty - stoves get beat up by cycling tour groups.
</li> 
<li><b>Liquid Fuel (White or Unleaded Gas) Stove Advantages and Disadvantages :
</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>At about 12,000 Feet (3650 M) or higher, Liquid Gasoline Fuel systems burn 
more efficiently and controllable than Propane/Butane Fuel systems.</li> 
<li>At about 15&deg; F (-10&deg; C) or lower, Liquid Gasoline Fuel systems 
burn more efficiently and controllable than Propane/Butane Fuel systems. How 
many cyclists cook meals above 12,000 Feet (3650 M) or below 15&deg; F 
(-10&deg; C)?</li> 
<li>The <b>advantages of an attached/combined burner and liquid fuel tank</b> 
are that separate pieces don't get separated among different packers, there is 
always fuel (assuming the tank is full) and the system is ready to use as soon 
as it is unpacked,<b>the system tends to be 'beefier' (heavy duty)</b>, and 
there may be directions printed on the tank (making life easier for new cyclist 
campers).</li> 
<li><b>WARNINGS: The disadvantages of an attached burner and liquid fuel tank
</b> are that one cannot have a camping type Oven set on the top of the burner 
and then tightly wrap a wind screen/reflector around the base - It is possible 
to overheat the fuel tank and burn up the entire system. If one is to use a 
camp oven system then use a burner that is separate or detached from the fuel 
source by means of a connecting cable. The connecting fuel cable must be heavy 
duty (like braded metal wiring over neoprene and NOT just a piece of plastic 
tubing that will easily melt). Plastic On/Off Fuel Control Knobs on some stoves 
have been known to melt from intense oven heat (metal knobs or controls are 
better). Sometimes these systems leak while transported, especially if the fuel 
is under pump pressure.<b>Experience:</b> When liquid gasoline stoves go bad, 
they start leaking fuel, usually while the stove is burning. Dennis had to grab 
one, once, and run it out of an extra large tent of a Wilderness Base Camp. We 
threw sand and dirt on it to put the flame out. The situation had the potential 
for becoming much worse. The same thing happened in a Scout Camp, in the 
outdoors, but the fault may not have been the stove's mechanics.</li> 
<li>The <b>advantages of separate burner and liquid fuel pump bottle</b> are 
that they are lighter and take up less space; components can be readily 
interchanged (or replaced). The insulated braded wire connecting fuel hose (or 
something ruggedly similar) allows one to use a oven system that uses a 
reflector around the burner such that the entire system can get quite hot (for 
baking) and not get so hot as to superheat a mounted fuel tank.</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Liquefied Gas (Propane/Butane) Stove Advantages and Disadvantages:</b>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li>It is not unusual for temperatures in the desserts or mountains to reach 
freezing but for us, our propane stove has never been mal affected. We have 
never had altitude problems with a propane stove but we haven't had to cook 
above 11,000 (3350 M). If we ever face either of these challenges, we'll have 
at least one white-gas stove system.<br>
<b>Experience:</b> We always bring 
all, or some, of the water and fuel into the tent at night, thus avoiding many 
cold temperature issues. We do NOT bring any food into the tent.</li> <br>
<b>
Experience:</b> During the summer, in Colorado Mountains, we have had water 
bottles left on bicycle cages freeze or partially freeze overnight.
<li>Canister Stoves, are very reliable and don't need servicing like White-Gas 
Stoves. We've never had a canister stove failure, but we have had two White-Gas 
stoves leak hot burning fuel (but not for over 15 years). All White-Gas stoves 
need servicing at some point (which is why they have repair kits).</li> 
<li>To the best of our knowledge, there is no such thing as a one piece 
propane/butane canister and stove. HOWEVER:<br>
 - A burner may be attached 
directly to the fuel bottle's outlet, OR<br>
 - A burner may be connected 
remotely via a fuel transfer hose to a fuel bottle.</li> 
<li>Burners on top of tall propane/butane canisters are prone to having large 
pots of food tip over, even from a good gust of wind (because of their narrow 
canister base). Ergo, it is better to place small clamp on burners only to the 
shorter 4 oz propane/butane canisters.<br>
<b>WISDOM: A person should NOT 
tightly wrap a wind-screen around a cooking pot/pan/oven, flame burner, and 
fuel canister for a high heat output or a long duration burn - Be sure that the 
Fuel Storage container is separated from the flame/heat wrap area.</b><br>
 
Cooking Requirements for high heat output or a long duration burn, like to 
perform oven type baking, should be performed on a burner that is detached from 
the fuel canister via a connecting hose. Field baking is often performed with a 
clever combination of pots and/or frying pans (or woks) mated together, or 
sometimes someone has brought a miniature camp oven. In any case, 
remote/detached burners are safer for this kind of cooking that requires high 
heat output or a long duration burn with a wind screen.</li> 
<li>Burners for propane/butane stoves seem to have a much better low heat 
control for lower temperature settings (like simmer, warm, or luke warm).</li> 
</ul> 
<li>Some 'stove systems' are designed to quickly heat 'their' pot using 
'their' heat shield. This is OK for cooking for 1 to 3 people, but not OK for 
larger groups (too time consuming, too ineffienct). Replacing a damaged 
proprietary component on the trail is nearly impossible; these systems are 
usually built to close fitting tolerances.</li> 
<li>Some stoves are designed for high heat output to more or less boil water 
quickly; these same stoves cannot be used or used very well to perform low heat 
functions, like to keep a cooked meal warm over a period of time, to simmer. On 
longer tours, good cooks like to start experimenting. If you have a cook that 
experiments in the kitchen (first of all, be thankful), get a stove with good 
control at low flame settings; usually propane systems are better at low heat 
settings.<br>
<br>
<b>The Importance of a Good Cook:</b> 
<blockquote> Charles Goodnight, famed Cattle Trail Boss of the American West, 
invented the Chuck Wagon for Quality Food Logistics Support [get the cowboy 
humor, Charles-Chuck Wagon] and he hired the very best cooks, knowing that Good 
Food was always at the heart of any sustained and successful trail drive.<br>

<br> Cowboys were known to ride a Hundred miles just to eat a pastry or 
doughnut with a cup of good coffee.<br>
<br>
 Hmm, Just like the modern cyclist!

<h2>International Travel Issues with Stoves and Fuel: </h2> 
<ul> 
<li><b>One cannot fly with fuel!</b> Fuel (propane or liquid fuel) must be 
purchased at the destination; purchasing fuel can be a royal pain and easily 
take up the majority of a day if one is not suitably prepared. Consider 
learning where or how to secure fuel before arrival. Consider having it shipped 
within the destination/country; this applies to food/rations also.</li> 
<li><b>One cannot fly with a stove that smells like fuel!</b> Per a blog 
article byDarren Alff, a one piece <b>liquid fuel stove may not be clean or dry 
enough</b>, even if empty enough (and it should be totally empty) <b>to pass 
airport security</b> or even leaking fluid standards. <b>Don't even try to 
bring a stove as carry-on luggage.</b> Darren states that <b>one should use a 
detachable fuel system for international travel</b> (for destination cycling). 
This suggests that one should to<b>leave the canisters behind when departing</b>
 and/or totally empty and dry out liquid fuel bottles.</li> 
<li>Stoves that burn liquefied gas (mainly butane or butane-propane mixtures), 
sometimes called Canister Stoves, offer instant lighting (for a price - it is 
worth it!). liquefied gas stoves are especially practical for travel in the 
USA, Europe, Japan, and populated areas of Asia and North America (versus 
Mongolia, Afghanistan, Alaska, and the Yukon)</li> 
<li><b>The most accessible and most available fuel on the planet is Unleaded 
Gasoline</b> (not wood, not propane). <b>By-the-way,</b> cooking with wood is 
becoming a lost skill; it is probably a skill worth knowing, as at some point 
the knowledge may be useful in some trek through a remote region. SeePot Soaping
.</li> 
<li><b>White Gas stoves to be used for International Travel should also burn 
Kerosene &amp; Diesel fuels as well as Unleaded Gasoline</b> (use the lowest 
octane automobile fuel). For the Record, in 2010, a good White-Gas/Unleaded-Gas 
stove costs 40-60 USD. A Stove that uses White-Gas/Unleaded-Gas, Kerosene, and 
Diesel fuels costs about 160-200 USD.</li> 
<li>Anything that burns kerosene and diesel should also handle <b>JP4 or JP5
</b> (aviation/<b>j</b>et engine/<b>p</b>ropulsion fuel - high grade, lower 
flash, kerosene) [NOT JP6 NOR JP7] - this advice from a former military pilot 
(Dennis).</li> 
<li><b>White Gasoline</b> is Gasoline with nothing in it, no additives, just 
ultra clean. It is possible that in some countries White Gasoline may be a mix 
of two or more distilled gasoline types with slightly different boiling points 
(and flash points) but for all practical purposes White-Gas is just gasoline. 
White Gasoline can be used in any automobile gasoline engine in an emergency 
situation.</li> 
<li><b>Coleman Fuel</b> and similarly competing fuels (that show an image of a 
Coleman pump stove and/or Coleman pump lantern on the container) are made from
<b>Naphtha</b>. Look for the word 'Naphtha.' <b>Naphtha is White Gasoline</b> 
(this knowledge from a Coleman representative). If one looks at the ingredients 
on the backside label, one will/should find 'Naphtha' listed somewhere. The 
corollary is that if one has found Naphtha listed on the back label of 
something that looks like it is pump lantern or pump stove fuel, it probably is 
pump lantern or pump stove fuel.<b>Experience:</b> We have never had an 
experience in foreign travel where anyone has lied to us about such things. If 
one can't speak the local language (or even if one can), break out the actual 
stove and ask (gesture by pantomiming the pouring of liquid into the stove). 
One will get gestures of agreement or violent non-agreement; it's not hard to 
figure out if it is OK.</li> 
<li>Interestingly, internationally, <b>the word 'Coleman Fuel' seems to be as 
well known, as 'White Gasoline'</b>. Some other words for White Gasoline are: 
shellite, gasoline, petro, naphtha, hexane, heptane, benzene, benzine, or 
benzin, as well as words that contain blanc, blanco, or bronco (latinized words 
meaning White). Some countries use different words and in some cases the same 
words may have different meanings; learn the words for white gasoline and 
unleaded gasoline for any country that you may visit. Learn a whole lot more 
aboutWhite Gas, Naphtha and Foreign Terms.</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>Hardware Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Be sure that any white gas stove, minimally, also burns unleaded gasoline.
</li> 
<li>White gas stoves require some form of fuel pressurization (by manually 
pumping). Know how to and have tested/operated all/any new stoves before 
touring.</li> 
<li>One must have appropriate and serviceable fuel containers/canisters that 
work with the particular stove/s.</li> 
<li>Always buy and use systems that are universal in their fittings and fuel 
types, or else one might be stuck with a system that only has supplies in one 
geographic region.</li> 
<li>Canister Stoves are very simple, convenient, and most carry instant 
lighters built into the burner (always buy built in lighters/igniters).</li> 
<li>Always have repair kits and instructions for white gas stoves (a good 
reason to have two identical stoves and carry only one repair kit). Get 
familiar with repair kit functions, usually the sales person or a fellow 
traveler has experience - Keep the instructions, Read the instructions.</li> 
<li>Always have a spare canister or bottle.</li> 
<li>Fuel Bottles, usually (to be purchased) should be in about 25-30 ounce 
sizes. Mark all Bottles and/or Canisters in the desired usage order (using 
judgment for different sizes, partial vs full, and when/where for the next 
supply opportunity). In addition, remember that white-gas stoves that sit on 
top of the fuel tank also hold 15-25 ounces of fuel.</li> 
<li>It is our experience that bottles of 10 to 20 ounce size are not practical 
for touring by bicycle; buy the larger storage containers.</li> 
<li>We have seen melted plastic knobs on gasoline and propane stove systems, 
avoid Plastic Knobs buy systems with all Metal Components (or as little plastic 
as is possible).</li> </ul> 
<li><b>Re-supply Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>- Until recently, the smallest quantity of Coleman fuel was<br>
<b>1 
gallon (3.78 Liters)</b>. Often, Backpackers and Cyclists would make a one 
gallon purchase at a store and be forced to leave some fuel in the Container, 
as they could not safely carry all of the fuel (too heavy, too bulky, or not 
enough safe storage containers/bottles). This problem does go away with bigger 
groups (like five or more campers to help spread the load).<br>
 - Coleman, 
now, has a<b>32 ounce (0.94 L) plastic bottle</b> for sale (assume disposable). 
One may not have to buy extra metal fuel storage bottles (we have yet to find 
or try). Not all retail stores have this size, call around, typically they are 
found in camping/outdoor type stores and they are available online (but 
shipping can be expensive).<br>
 - Coleman and some other competing vendors, 
now, have a<b>1 quart (~.97 L)</b> of mostly Naphtha (Coleman Fuel basis) in a 
metal container, which is available in some camping type stores. This may help 
small groups not have to leave partial cans of fuel.</li> 
<li>Usually, in a group, white gasoline (liquid stove fuel) is carried across 
2 to 6 lined metal safety storage bottles; these bottles are typically 
distributed evenly among the touring group. Unfortunately, in some cases, only 
one gallon fuel containers are available for purchase and sometimes not all of 
the fuel can be used. Very often, cyclists are forced to leave some fuel with 
the sales establishment. On occasion, while this has not happened to us, one 
may ask if anyone left any partially used fuel containers. On occasion, some 
people get lucky.</li> 
<li>We have not seen a need for more than 6 bottles for any trip to include 
those heard about from other expedition thru tours.</li> 
<li>Propane/Butane Canisters typically are 4 oz or 8 oz in size. Most 
canisters, when nearing empty, have low pressure delivery issues; we just swap 
out canisters at this point. There is a newer 16 oz Canister available now. We 
number our canisters so as not have more than two partial full canisters with a 
two stove/burner setup. Always have a permanent marker or grease pencil on tour.
</li> </ul> 
<li><b>In the Field Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Fuel transfer is always and only conducted on cold stoves usually before 
or just before using the stove for cooking (NEVER on a lit stove, a hot stove, 
or a stove that was just used!).</li> 
<li>Fuel bottles and canisters should be marked for usage order (grease 
pencil, permanent marker).</li> 
<li>White Gas stoves can sometimes be fussy but they work in a wider range of 
cold temperatures and are reported (by mountain climbers) to work better in 
higher altitudes (but we have not witnessed any altitude or temperature issues 
with propane). Of course we are not cycling in freezing temperatures. We live 
in Colorado at 7,500 FT (2200 M) and everything has been tested up to 11,000 
(3,300 M). Note that we try to camp at or below 10,000 FT (3000 M) or below 
tree-line, just for healthy breathing at night. Note that butane lighters quit 
working around 7-8,000 FT (22-2400 M). Use matches up to about 11,500 (3500 M), 
then magnesium strikers.</li> 
<li>Burners that sit on top of Propane/Butane Canisters are better served on 
the low profile, low center of gravity, smaller 4 oz canister than on a 8 oz 
canister (totally avoid 16 oz canister for direct mount burners - one good 
breeze may dump a complete meal onto the ground). Detached Burners (connected 
by a hose) work well with any canister size. We mix our canister size purchases 
so that 4 oz canisters exist primarily as a backup/spare and we try to use 
larger canisters as the primary fuel source. Once one uses a 4 oz spare, then a 
numbering system is needed to indicate a practical and functional usage order 
(or one goes through all of the mental gymnastics each time one heats something 
or one gets stuck with one stove and no backup - not a fun scenario).</li> </ul>
<li><b>Group Travel Issues:</b></li> 
<ul> 
<li>Stoves and Bottles should be distributed among cyclist but cyclist types 
loosely fall into one of two categories. Those that typically arrive to camp 
early and those that typically arrive later. It does not take long to learn 
typical cyclist patterns and most people know their classification before 
starting a group tour. Wally Werner of Adventure Cycling calls these groups 
Rabbits and Turtles. I'm a Turtle [there is an old bar room joke there]. <i>
Soooo the point is</i> that for good group tour organization purposes, one 
wants Rabbits to carry the Stoves, as they are usually the first to arrive at 
camp, so that they may initiate boiling/warming water for the cook(s).</li> 
<li>It is noteworthy that whoever is on duty for cooking needs to make 
extraordinary effort to arrive at camp relatively early on his or her cooking 
day so as be able to serve supper to the group in a timely manner.</li> </ul> 
</ul> </ul> 
<h2>Fire and Cooking Issues </h2> 
<ul> 
<li><b>The first rule of fire making is that the fire maker must be prepared 
to put it out.</b> Have water handy, a cover, and/or something like a large 
thick flannel shirt.</li> 
<li>More and more places, especially in the USA and Europe, do not allow wood 
fires or open fires.</li> 
<li><b>Pot Soaping:</b> If one has to cook with wood (or sticks, straw, grass 
...) for fire, then pre-soap the outside of the cooking pot so that suet will 
wash/clean off easier/better; for washing in these conditions, besides using a 
Brillo pad, clean sand may be used to scrub a pot's outside. When soaping a 
pot, the thinnest of water and soap mixed will serve (don't worry about thick 
areas - cleans easily). The best application is liquid dish soap but as young 
Scouts we directly rubbed the pot's side with a bar of soap that was dipped in 
water (don't worry about clumps).</li> 
<li>We always carry one new Brillo Pad (in a plastic sealed bag) although we 
have not used one for years - It's a just in case thing. There is nothing wrong 
with blackened pot sides, in fact dark exteriors on pots/pans makes them heat 
faster, one just doesn't want suet on packed cooked ware as it dirties other 
gear or containers.</li> 
<li>A Sterno type stove or 'Sterno Can' may also make a nice backup stove, as 
does a tin-can and some diesel fuel (use only outdoors) - See Emergency Stove, 
Next Bullet.</li> 
<li><b>Emergency Stove (or Hobo Stove):</b><br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Diesel, Kerosene, White-Gas:</b> A metal can about the size of a small 
tuna fish can is an ideal size (but not a requirement) will serve as a fire 
container. Remove the lid, leave the bottom intact. Cut holes cut just below 
the upper/open edge (from little finger nail size to thumb nail size), mix and 
alternate the holes with spacing such that the container will still support a 
loaded pot or pan. Pour in about .25-.50 inch of fuel. Exercise all safety 
precautions (see Emergency Fuel below).</li> 
<li><b>Alcohol:</b> One needs a taller flame to obtain the highest heat 
output. Use an empty Coca-Cola sized can or something the size of a Campbell's 
Soup can. Remove the lid, keep the bottom. Punch 4-5 holes about 1.5-2 inches 
up from the bottom, evenly spaced, about .25-.35 inches round. Also punch about 
5 holes, about .25-.35 inches round, .5 inches from the top, evenly spaced; 5 
holes, about .25-.35 inches round, about 1.0 inches from the top, evenly 
spaced; and 5 holes, about .25-.35 inches round, 2.0 inches from the top, 
evenly spaced. Avoid punching holes in such a manner as to weaken the can's 
support of a pot or pan. Pour in about 1.0 inch of fuel. Exercise all safety 
precautions (see Emergency Fuel below).</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Emergency Fuel:</b> First of all, consider Wood if it is an option. 
Also consider other liquid fuels of the area/region (alcohol, diesel, kerosene, 
lamp oil, JP4, or cooking oil; use white gasoline or unleaded gasoline as a 
last resort [its more volatile but manageable]). Make a hobo stove per the 
previous instruction. Use all safety practices, to include: open area, over 
dirt, cleared space, not indoors, not in a tent nor under a tarp, never pour 
fuel into the stove while it has a flame and note that the flame is often 
invisible. Don't pour out any remaining liquid until it's absolutely cool and 
safe (sometimes flames are invisible). Don't try to recover unused fuel, way 
too dangerous. Sometimes a person may find two cans such that one fits inside 
the other - use the bigger can for storage and for extinguishing the fire. The 
fire can/stove will get very smutty. It may be wise to have old news paper or 
disposable rag for handling.</li> 
<li><b>In ultra remote areas</b>, wood fires are not unusual but be smart 
about the situational issues. It is wise to:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Have cooking and cleanup done by night fall.</li> 
<li>NOT have night fires as fires can attract unwanted human visitors.</li> 
<li>Not have smoky day time fires that can be seen for miles</li> 
<li>Shield fires from the wind and long range view.</li> 
<li>Sometimes eat cold food and not have a fire at all.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<h3>Fire Starter, Wind Proof Lighter, Matches, and Magnesium Striker Issues:
</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Some people carry emergency fire starter material; usually this is a 
little cube of something bought commercially or it may be homemade (like wax or 
paraffin drizzled onto Lint from a clothes dryer). Clothes dryer lint makes a 
great fire starter. Carry the fire starting material in a sealed plastic lunch 
bag.<br>
<b>Note:</b> In some countries, the word 'Paraffin' means Kerosene, 
here Paraffin means a white waxy flammable substance.</li> 
<li>It is wise to have at least two fire starting igniter sources {book of 
matches, sealed waterproof matches, cheap butane lighter, magnesium striker; 
battery and two wires; 9v battery and steel wool}.</li> 
<li><b>CAUTION:</b> We have yet to see a propane/butane lighter, especially a 
&quot;Wind Proof&quot; lighter, be dependable above 7,000+ Feet Altitude 
(&tilde;2,000 Meters).</li> 
<li> Magnesium Strikers always work (assuming magnesium exists!) no matter the 
weather conditions or altitude. Magnesium Strikers make a spark, NOT a flame.
</li> 
<li>Generally, we camp with books of matches and a cheap 7/11 disposable 
butane lighter for short trips and we will also have a magnesium striker for 
longer trips.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Bicycle Tour Clothing Issues </h2> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>See How Much Do I Carry/Pack?</li> 
<li>The Food and Clothing Supplies Risk/Planning Parameters are as follows: 
<ul> 
<li>When resupply points are closer together (and known), then cyclists can 
travel lighter on food and lighter on clothing.</li> 
<li>When resupply points are further apart (or unknown), cyclists must carry 
more food and more clothing.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>See On-Bike Clothing Checklist for Bicycle Clothing</li> 
<li>See Off-Bike Clothing Checklist for Camp/Tour Clothing</li> 
<li>See Common Travel Modes (Touches on Clothing Requirements for various 
Travel Modes).</li> 
<li><b>Synthetic versus Organic Clothing:</b> 
<ul> 
<li>Generally synthetic clothing is lighter in weight, holds/retains less 
water, dries much quicker and tends to reduce the amount of bacteria or yeast 
naturally held in the material.</li> 
<li>Synthetic clothing, when designed for such, can wick moisture away from 
the body far better than for organic clothing.</li> 
<li>Organic clothing, particularly cotton, can be more comfortable on a hot 
day because of the sweat retention and evaporation.</li> 
<li>Synthetic clothing tends to be much more prone to fire spark damage and 
burns faster than organic clothing if flash exposed to open fire.</li> 
<li>Synthetic clothing, when worn in a fire/hot atmosphere will damage the 
human body more than its organic clothing counterpart, in fact cotton and wool 
offer a little protection or burn delay when compared to synthetic clothing. 
Military Pilots are only allowed to wear cotton undies under their Nomex (flame 
retardant) flight suits for this reason.</li> 
<li>Many synthetic clothing items will virtually dry by spinning it overhead 
but organic clothing may need an hour or two to dry out in a best case 
scenario. When compared side-by-side in identical conditions, synthetic 
clothing will ALWAYS dry faster.</li> 
<li>Synthetic clothing tends to not hold as many germs over the long haul.</li>
<li>Synthetic sleeping bag materials dry faster than goose down and can 
provide insulation when partially wet, goose down cannot. Synthetic sleeping 
bag materials tend to be heavier than goose down for the same amount of 
insulation R Value. More aboutSleeping Bags.</li> 
<li>Synthetic clothing generally lasts/wears longer than organic clothing.</li>
<li>Synthetic socks designed for hiking tend be far superior to organic 
materials for wear and for causing less blistering.</li> 
<li>Organic clothing can hold up to direct applications of DEET but synthetic 
clothing may melt. DEET will destroy or ruin the effectiveness of synthetic 
clothing.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>See Insect Repellent discussions (DEET and Permethrin, read the hyper 
notes).</li> 
<li>See Laundry (How to Clean your Clothes on an ongoing Bicycle Tour).</li> 
<li><b>Storms and Clothing:</b> One big variable addresses whether one is in a 
passing thunderstorm (where the sun will likely be out later in the day) or a 
monsoon (where one may be socked in for days of rain).<br>

<ul> 
<li>'Weather out the Storm' - The expression means to stay put for the 
duration of the storm and it is a valid consideration; some related variables 
are safety for the particular location, weather protection, food supplies, 
sanitation, and one's general ability and capability to stay in place for a 
while. Sometimes one must bike for a while in wet miserable conditions just to 
get to dry lodging where one can hole-up for a few days.</li> 
<li>'Dry Out Now or Dry Out Later' - The expression addresses the issue of 
whether to pack and leave an area with wet gear or stay in an area and dry the 
gear in sunlight? A big mitigating issue is whether it will be sunny along the 
planned travel route? AND, when will the sun be rise high enough to effectively 
dry wet gear? AND, how low will the drying process take?<br>
 - Generally, we 
have learned to pack up wet, and take time to dry the gear and clothing at mid 
day in what is often the sunniest/warmest part of the day (when the Sun is as 
its most efficient and effective heating angles). If one waits to let the 
morning sun dry the gear it takes longer (which is lost travel time in what is 
often the desirable and cooler day light cycling hours). On the other hand, wet 
gear is heavier and unless it is packed correctly it can get other dry things 
wet - It takes a little deliberate packing finesse to pack wet gear and not get 
other gear wet. Generally, from experience, we pack wet and move out (in these 
conditions).</li> 
<li>During the noon-lunch rest-stop, if it is bright and sunny, hang items out 
to dry while lunching.</li> 
<li>Usually the mid day sun dries items faster than the morning or evening sun.
</li> 
<li>Except in arid areas, washed gear will not dry out at night. So, the 
best/most-efficient time to dry clothing is in the midday sun. That means that 
one often stops for an extended lunch and hangs laundry on a bike, fence, or 
picnic table in order to dry items of use.</li> 
<li>While cycling, it is common to leave wet gear under a strap or net, 
exposed to the wind and/or sun, in order to dry objects.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Always use a waterproof bag for clothing storage</b>, clear bags seem 
to be the most serviceable but any waterproof bag is better than nothing. Also 
use waterproof bags for the sleeping bag(s) and the sleeping pad(s). However, 
note that if a sleeping pad gets wet, one can cover it with a space blanket 
(recommended to carry). A wet bag or wet clothing usually ends touring for a 
while (or in total) and the effort to dry said gear becomes the focus of most 
of one's effort, like finding a town or place with a Clothes Dryer.</li> 
<li>Most of the time the cyclist will be carrying their own clothing so total 
weight matters. One can carry as much as they want but most people want to 
carry as little as is needed.</li> 
<li>Most of the time, the cyclist's own bike clothing is serviceable for off 
the bike activities, but not always. Make choices, the trade off is extra/more 
weight to carry.</li> 
<li>Reflective strips can be bought in most good fabric stores or ordered 
online and added onto clothing and/or gear. Sewing, while time consuming, will 
outlast iron-on strips.</li> 
<li>Cargo Pants/Shorts (many pockets) are becoming increasingly popular for 
touring cyclists, especially those pants designed with Zip On/Off Leggings.</li>
<ul> 
<li><b>Note:</b> There are at least two different ways to mount Cargo Pant 
Pockets:<br>
 1 - Flat edge sewn.<br>
 2 - Baffle edge sewn.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> In the worst case scenario, <b>Baffle Sewn Cargo Pant 
Pockets can get you Killed.</b> In the field, baffle pockets can hang up on or 
snatch anything that you walk by or bike by, this is especially problematic in 
brush country, almost any narrow access path or bike path, in and around many 
vehicles, walkways, and places of lodging; the pockets can hang-up on just 
about everything that sticks out at thigh level (drawer knobs, plants, sticks, 
protruding rocks, brush, fence posts, fence wire ends, almost any barbed wire, 
door handles [especially those for physically challenged people], vehicle arm 
rests, door jambs, hand rail ends, gate posts). Most of these examples have 
come from actual personal experience.</li> 
<li><b>Solutions:</b><br>
 - <b>Do NOT Buy or obtain pants with any kind with 
baffle pockets</b>.<br>
 - Technical Issue: Be aware that some pockets have 
flat sewn edges but darted baffles in the middle or pocket center, avoid these 
too.<br>
 - If you have pants like this, either get rid of them or sew down the 
edging in a manner that the pockets won't hook on or snag on any objects when 
you walk by or bike by said objects.</li> </ul> 
<li>Generally, select and pack clothing for a Layers Capability.</li> 
<li><b>Warning:</b> Packing at warm-lower locations-elevations when the 
destination is cool, cold, or freezing, leaves many distressed at altitude.</li>
<li>The work of bicycling in cool weather keeps one warm, but as soon as one 
stops biking, a physical cool down occurs. Keep a jacket and a hat handy to 
stay warm and sometimes gloves are useful.</li> 
<li>GoreTex or similar Jackets are handy for rain, warmth, and wind.</li> 
<li><b>Lady Modesty:</b> Just a reminder that in 3/4 of the world, the showing 
of bare shoulders and/or bare legs isculturally sensitive (to include southern 
or eastern Europe) and sometimes that style of dress can bar one from entering 
some establishments, especially government buildings, shrines, churches, and 
religious centers.<b>It is wise to consider the dressing customs of destination 
countries.</b></li> 
<li>It is common to see long distance cyclists in regular out-of-doors 
clothing that is fit for the climate(s) and region(s) - It often has to do with 
snow covered mountain passes, rocky mountain roads, floods, marshes, rain, mud, 
hot sand, and walk-pushing a damaged bike.</li> </ul><br>

<br>

<h2>Water, Sanitation, and Cleanup:</h2> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Water purification &amp; filtration systems work.</b> The old fashioned 
way, BOILING, is performed in three stages.</li> 
<ol> 
<li>Let the water settle in a big container, if possible, then scoop off the 
clearer water to boil in another container. Usually it takes about fifteen 
minutes for a sufficient settling process. [This big container settling process 
will usually double the life of portable water filter systems too.]</li> 
<li>Boil water for about five minutes and then let it cool.</li> 
<li>As the water cools, no bubbles, add chlorine in the form of two drops per 
liter/quart or five drops per gallon (best ratio), mix and let set for at least 
five minutes - Unscented Clorox works very well.</li> </ol> 
<ul> 
<li>Boiling water or cooking over a fire: If the pot is already black and 
crusty, on the outside, from the smoke of many wood fires, then use that pot as 
is. If one has a shiny new pot and one wants it to stay shiny, then coat the 
outside of the pot with a thin layer of soap, cook and/or boil water, and then 
wash the pot clean. The soap coating can be from liquid soap spread very thin 
or from water and a bar of soap - both work well. The pot will become very 
black but the places that were soaped will come out shiny clean after a wash. 
It really saves time to have soapy steel wool (like Brillo) for the cleaning.<i>
Make note of the following ...</i></li> 
<li>Cookware that is black or blackened on the outside (the fire side) 
actually heats up faster (than cookware that is bright and shiny).</li> 
<li>Covered food pots heat up much faster than uncovered food pots.</li> 
<li>Start the cleanup water boiling while eating the meal. Knowing this 
behavior is the difference between a First Class Scout and a Tenderfoot - 
Tenderfeet need guidance.</li> </ul> 
<li>Handy Wipes, in foil packets like those dispensed at some restaurants, or 
Baby Wipes are quite handy for cleaning sunscreen off the fingers and for 
cleaning up after a tire flat, chain break, chain sprocket slip off, bike 
assembly, or even cleaning up for a trail lunch.</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Baby wipes serve another good purpose on road weary bottoms.</li> 
<li>We usually have both cleaning wipe types and they can be purchased in bulk 
at X-Mart.</li> 
<li>We carry about six to ten foils per ride, three or four with the tire 
changing tools, the remainders in the handlebar-bag.</li> 
<li>We also put about a One Inch depth of baby wipes into a quart sized 
plastic zip bag and keep it handily available along with the toilet paper 
(which is also stored in a waterproof plastic sandwich bag).</li> </ul> See 
next item.
<li>We pack out everything but human waste - We never leave trash anywhere.
</li> </ul> 
<h3>Water Facts and Management:</h3> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>In Freezing environments or on very cool mornings, when one can, fill 
water containers with Hot Water. Sometimes the container needs to be warmed up 
before filling with Hot Water.</li> 
<li>When overnighting in freezing temperatures (this can be any mountain in 
the middle of summer), pay careful attention to NOT let water freeze. It takes 
too much time and energy to thaw frozen water and it takes too many human 
calories to warm water in the body. Bring water in bottles into the tent and 
position them away from cold areas. In some environmental conditions, some 
people sleep with a bottle or two.</li> 
<li>Water Always Freezes at 32&deg; F / 0&deg; C, but at higher altitudes with 
dry humidity (mountains), it feels warmer! Water Boils at lower temperatures at 
higher altitudes, which is potentially both a sanitation and cooking issue (air 
pressure).</li> 
<li>At sea level water boils at 212&deg; F or 100&deg; C - As a rule of thumb, 
for every 500 Feet elevation (or 150 Meters), water boiling temperature drops 
1&deg; F (or .5&deg; C).</li> </ul> 
<h1>HOW TO POOP IN THE WILD! </h1> No one ever writes about this topic and <b>
travel sanitation</b> is important: 
<ol> 
<li>Find a private place (or as private as possible) with soft dirt, gravel, 
or sand.<br>
<b>Note:</b> One does not make business near camp, food, or water 
systems.<br>
<b>Note:</b> 100 feet is usually a practical safe distance and 100 
yards is a group sanitary safe distance, but sometimes either distance can be 
impractical.<br>
<b>Note:</b> Place all removed belongings in one spot.<br>
<b>
Note:</b> Do the best for the situation at hand and think about others that may 
follow.</li> <br>

<li> Dig, with a metal foldup garden trowel (or real garden trowel or plastic 
camping trowel), a &quot;cat hole&quot; about a foot deep and four to six 
inches wide. Pile the dirt to the side because it is coming right back to the 
hole. In rock strewn sites, a space between rocks may be necessitated and then 
be covered with a three rock cover.<br>
<b>Note</b> that we are using an orange 
colored plasic trowel from a Camping Store.<br>
<b>Note</b> that experienced 
people place the toilet paper roll on the trowel handle.</li> <br>

<li>Do business.<br>
<b>Note</b> that plastic bag is used to carry the toilet 
paper and protect the paper from dirt or water while also protecting gear from 
paper flaking.</li> <br>

<li>Cover the business and paper work (arh arh) with the previously removed 
clean dirt - The shovel never touches the waste.</li> <br>

<li>Cover the filled hole with two crossed sticks (best), or crossed grass 
bunches, or three rocks (stacked smaller &amp; centered upward). All markings 
are the international sign for don't step, dig, or go here.<br>
<br>
<b>Note:
</b> Some people carry handiwipes to wash/clean/sanitize their hands at the 
poop spot, some leave said materials at the bike.It is impossible to carry 
enough saniwipe or handiwipe tissue for hand sanitation on a long tour. On 3 or 
4 day tours, we do carry enough saniwipe and/or handiwipe tissue, but on long 
tours we rely on a good ol soap bar (more utilitous than liquid soap and its 
associated bottle management). We usually use bicycle squirt bottles to wash 
the hands with bar soap (small, carried in its own plastic bag), sometimes at 
the poop site or sometimes back at the bicycle.<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Remember 
to pick up your belongings (gloves ...)!<br>

<h2>Sanitation Issues:</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Long-Term Survival</b> is based on not getting sick or injured. Most 
people can be sloppy for about three days (and get away with poor sanitation 
habits), but then Mother Nature rears her head and smites thee.</li> 
<li><b>Wash your hands</b> with soap or germicide after bladder or bowel 
relief; wash your hands before preparing or eating a meal. Soap remains the 
best long term agent/survival-tool for killing germs (while other sanitation 
substances do exist); soap is available for sale at most commercial areas 
enroute for travelers (store, shop or roadside stand). There are other native 
sanitation products that seem to be effective in the same native/indigenous 
areas.</li> 
<li><b>Carry a Bar of Soap</b>; keep it handy in a plastic zipper type bag. We 
usually keep Soap, Toilet Paper, Sani-Wipes, and Trash in separate plastic bags 
but located in the same pocket/pannier area (usually in front).</li> 
<li><b>Keep a large mouth plastic container</b> and lid (an old empty salsa 
bottle, for example) about 25-30 ounce in size, and use it for night time 
liquid relief. No more late night scrambles in a dark country side from a tent 
(or cabin or hostel with no toilet) looking for a toilet or a place to go. 
Empty the container in the morning and rinse it appropriately for pannier 
storage. We call this container a &quot;P&quot; bottle. [See Picture Right-Side 
and Up.]</li> 
<li>Take partial used role(s) of toilet paper from home, flatten &amp; 
compress the roll to take up less space. All experienced travelers of remote 
areas, regardless of weath, position, or power, have a stash of toilet paper 
somewhere.</li> 
<li>Keep the fresh toilet paper in a zip lock bag to protect it form moisture 
or paper flaking. We pack out used paper (other than what is buried) in another 
gallon sized plastic bag - we also place other accumulated trash in the same 
bag and we have been known to leave an area a little cleaner than we found it, 
a common practice among travelers (as well as to collect and leave more 
firewood, if appropriate). Whenever we pass through a town or village we dump 
the trash in a receptacle but sometimes it can be three of four days between 
towns or trash can availability. We may or may not keep the plastic container 
bag, depending on bag wear or bag contents.</li> 
<li>Outside of the USA and away from big cities anywhere, most toilet 
facilities will not have toilet paper or if they do have paper, a person may 
have to pay to use a Toilet/WC. Always have local small coinage. We used to be 
bothered by paying for toilet use, but now we appreciate that a facility exists 
at all and that it is clean and has paper.</li> 
<li>Bike it In, Bike it Out. Leave NO Trace!<br>
 Also, Banana peels on the 
ground are very<i>d&eacute;class&eacute;.</i></li> 
<li>Flip top water bottles offer better protection from road elements. This 
was particularly noteworthy after a cattle truck splashed by us, but note that 
cattle and sheep trucks travel on all roads and all off road biking is done in 
animal country.</li> 
<li><b>Caution:</b> Avoid being on the outside of a road curve with (or down 
hill from) a cattle or stock truck - stuff slides!<br>
<b>Caution:</b> If a 
biker is waiting at a stop (light or sign) they are naturally positioned on the 
edge of the outside lane, such that if a stock truck pulls up beside the 
cyclist, because of the designed curvature of the roadway, that person is down 
hill from the truck.</li> </ul><br>

<h2>Laundry and/or Cleaning Your Clothes on a Bicycle Tour:</h2> Top, Bicycle 
Touring Checklist, Personal Bathing <br>
<br>
 Ahh, the necessary drudgery of 
getting clothes washed. After a few days on the road, the importance of 
personal sanitation grows. Cyclists must pay more attention to all sanitation 
issues (bathroom, cooking, cleaning, personal ... ), of which bacteria free 
clothing must become a focused priority. There are dirt, splatter, and grease 
concerns (which tend to be cosmetic) and<b>there are bacteria, yeast, mold ... 
concerns (which may mal affects one's health)</b>. We are addressing both 
cleaning issues here.<br>
<br>
 If one is on a self guided free schedule tour 
then washing clothes or having clothes washed isn't much of an issue other than 
performing the deed and getting the clothes dried because one has the time and 
one can time the washing with a sunny day for drying. It's those guided or time 
delimitated tours where washing clothes or having clothes washed is problematic 
because the task needs to be fit into an otherwise nearly completely booked 
schedule, i.e., finding time is a problem.<b>Doing laundry is especially 
problematic if one is staying at hotels where there is no laundry service</b> 
(which is more common than people realize, especially for foreign travel in 
rural areas [where most bike travelers expect/want to tour]). Laundry issues 
seem easier to address if one is camping, unless one has to move whether or not 
the clothes are dry.<br>
<br>

<h3>Philosophical Clothes Packing Interrelated Questions:</h3> 
<ol> 
<ol> 
<li>How much does one carry of what garment type (shirts, pants, undies)?</li> 
<li>How often should one wash clothes?</li> 
<li>When should one wash clothes?</li> 
<li>What opportunities exist to do laundry in mass (self or service)?</li> 
</ol> </ol> 
<h3>Issues and Answers (<i>Assuming No Laundry Service Available</i>):</h3> 
<ol> The following relates to the How Much to Carry Section on the Tour 
Planning Web Page. First of all almost no one carries more than 7 days of 
clothing. Usually right around 3 to 4 days is the most that one carries (except 
maybe more underpants), knowing that laundry will be performed by the cyclists 
while enroute (almost daily).<b>Most cyclists perform their laundry when they 
can</b>, thus it is performed almost daily or nightly ( <b>once per 24 hour 
cycle</b>). This Road Philosophy (of washing daily) allows a cyclist to skip 
wash on rainy days, on very humid days (which may last a few days), or on 
hurried and stressful days and still have something dry and clean to wear.<b>On 
Hotel based tours</b>, one usually does the laundry daily if possible, washing 
just before or after the evening meal depending on available time.<b>On Camp 
based tours</b>, depending on whether one is expecting to cycle out of camp the 
next day, either, one does laundry washing just before or after the evening 
meal and lets the clothing dry over night, or one does laundry washing in the 
morning and sun dries it during the day (maybe while making a side trip).<br>

<br> One way to reduce the laundry choir(s) is to: 
<ul> 
<li><b>Carry/pack more underwear than shirts and pants</b>; underwear items 
tend to be lighter and the benefit of more undies usually outweighs the added 
weight issue.</li> 
<li>Another way to reduce the laundry work load upon one's self is to <b>
carry/pack only clothing made of easy wash and fast dry (synthetic) material(s)
</b> like nylon, rayon, or polyester.</li> 
<li>Cotton, Wool, and natural fiber materials take much much longer to dry 
thoroughly - It is a comparison of<b>hours versus days of drying time</b> 
compared to synthetic materials.</li> 
<li>Another trick that experienced travelers use is to pay attention to the 
weather.<b>Perform Laundry tasks on warm/hot sunny days</b>; avoid the 
necessity of performing laundry tasks on cloud covered, cool, wet humid or 
rainy days.</li> 
<li>When possible, take advantage of passing through a <b>town, city, or 
village that has laundry services or a do-it-yourself laundry facility</b>. 
BTW, this issue is one of the few times that we<b>consider staying at a KOA 
type campground</b> for an overnight - One can usually use their washing 
machines and clothes dryers (and warm showers are nice too).</li> 
<li>It is always <b>optimal if laundry can dry over night</b> (when camp-ing 
or hotel-ing and not inhibit travel). Sometimes, it is wise to know when to 
'hole up' for a day or two or three for passing monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes, 
tropical depressions, and/or storm fronts.</li> 
<li>Some work effort can be saved by soaking clothing before washing and in 
certain cases, apply some soap directly to a soiled or stained area for soaking.
</li> 
<li>Liquid soaps rule (versus powder).</li> 
<li><b>Hotel shampoos work well for washing clothes</b>.</li> 
<li>We use the same liquid (Green) soap for dishes, laundry, and personal 
washing.</li> 
<li>We don't carry a hair dryer (some folks do), but <b>if it is too humid to 
allow clothing to dry naturally, we will consider using a hair dryer to dry a 
day's wash</b> (assuming that we can't get clothes done by or at a laundry 
service by the next morning for a reasonable cost).</li> 
<li><b>Some hotels have public washers and dryers</b>, ask. In the negative, 
ask hotel workers if there is a way to get an out-of-hotel 
service/business/entrepreneur to do laundry or if there is a laundry facility 
nearby. Maybe slip a worker a few coins for useful information.</li> </ul> <br>

About<b>Hair Dryers</b> (assuming that the Hotel does not have a fast 
inexpensive laundry washing service): Sometimes a Hair Dryer can be used to dry 
clothing if the air is super humid and clothes won't dry unassisted, over night.
<i>Otherwise</i>, ask for extra towels (we do this all the time); <b>we ring 
the wet, just washed, clothing in a sink and then wring the clothing inside a 
towel</b> (usually about 1 shirt and 1 pants per towel ring and/or 2 undies and 
4 socks per towel ring and a towel seems to handle only 2 or 3 wring sessions - 
roughly). Then we hang the items to dry (often in this order) on:
<ul> 
<li>Towel Rack(s)</li> 
<li>Curtain Rods</li> 
<li>Seat/Chair Backs</li> 
<li>In the sun</li> 
<li>In an air flow</li> 
<li>Window</li> 
<li>Porch Rail or Porch Furnishings</li> 
<li>Air Vent</li> 
<li>Other room feature</li> </ul> Yes our room may temporarily look like a 
13th century hovel. Binder Clips can be used as Clothes Pins and some people 
carry little half sized plastic camp clips/clothes-pins (not us). By the Way, 
so far we have been able to use hotel shampoos for the soap component of the 
clothes washing - One has to experiment for how much to use and when a spot 
needs extra soap or rubbing attention.<br>
<br>
If a cyclist knows that Laundry 
can be serviced every 2 days then one only needs 3 days of clothing in total. 
If a cyclist does NOT know how often laundry can be serviced, then one needs to 
plan to carry more spare clothing and be prepared to perform their own clothes 
washing. After a few weeks, even self washed laundry is ready for a washer and 
dryer or a professional laundry service. Again, it is the guided or time 
delimitated tours that adds stress to the cyclist to address the laundry 
service issue on a time line. People on their own schedule can make a day for 
performing laundry and other choirs or duties.<br>
<br>
While camping, we have 
had to pack-up wet tents and wet clothing and travel (for a variety of reasons, 
one of which is knowing that the destination was sunnier or warmer). In such a 
case, sometimes some items can be hung over a pannier or trailer to dry while 
the bikes were moving, and sometimes we have just waited until the 11 am to 2 
pm time window to take advantage of the sun being out in order to dry clothes 
(often tied to a lunch break or a travel break - See side image).</ol><br>
<br>

<h2>About Insect Repellents, DEET and Permethrin:</h2> Top<br>
<br>

<ul> <b>ABOUT DEET:</b> 100% DEET works best and has tested best as an insect 
repellent, especially for mosquitoes, but DEET may pose a health hazard. In 
over 2,000,000,000 applications of DEET, there have been just over 30 reported 
skin irritant reactions (rash like). DEET can and will destroy GoreTex and 
Plastic, melts it. In Alaska, the leading killer of Grizzlies are Mosquitoes, 
literally sucking the life out! In the mainland US, the West Nile Disease is 
spreading by Mosquito. Malaria and other known diseases (like sleeping 
sickness) can be spread by Mosquitoes. There is a likelihood that the mosquito 
can carry the bird-flue virus as well as other pathogens. One can purchase 
other types of bug repellent but none are scientifically proven to be better 
than 100% DEET. Choose. Spray cans with DEET easily ruins synthetic material. 
BEST APPLICATION: Hand apply liquid from bottle to skin or cotton clothing. 
Don't apply to eyes or other body orifices, don't apply to synthetic clothing, 
rubber (synthetic or real), don't apply with glove.<br>
<br>
<b>DEET USE 
WARNING: More plastic coated equipment</b> (knife and tool handles), <b>
synthetics</b> (GoreTex, polar fleece, nylon with waterproof coating), <b>
painted/lacquered finishes</b> (bikes, lighters), <b>leather</b> 
(driving/shooting gloves, handlebar wraps),<b>rubber</b> (gloves, grips, wraps) 
<b>and plastic ware</b> (like compasses, GPS cases, iPod/music devices, and 
eating ware)<b>has been ruined by DEET than by animals or rough handling.</b> 
The contents of DEET or its dispensing agent dissolves synthetic materials. 
Even when the DEET container is double bagged in plastic zipper locked bags, 
after traveling for a while, the DEET container/bottle seems to leak and the 
storage bags seem to acquire at least one tiny hole which allows the liquid to 
get out.<b>It is wise to try to carry DEET at the lowest point</b> in a bag / 
pannier / box / container. This is particularly<b>more of a problem on Bicycles 
and ATVs</b> as they tend to have many more bounces per minute than other forms 
of transportation (thus a higher risk factor for causing both a DEET container 
leak and a puncture in the outer container/bag).</ul> 
<h3>DEET Cautions:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Never apply DEET with gloves on - it will ruin the gloves.</li> 
<li>If there is DEET on the fingers and one touches anything, the DEET will 
remove writing or graphical images from the things that are touched, like Bike 
Cassette/Sprocket Ring Indicator Numbers, camera lettering and icons (on/off, 
movie, shutter speeds, flash, ...), compass ticks and markings, and any enamel 
on anything (e.g., GPS, iPod, Cell, ...).</li> 
<li>If one uses a spray bottle with DEET, learn to spray it on the bare palm 
and then hand apply it to skin areas.</li> 
<li>If one sprays DEET on Plastic, Nylon, or GoreTex, the DEET will destroy it.
</li> 
<li>Don't get repellent anywhere near anyone's eyes, lips, or arm pits.</li> 
<li>Complements Permethrin which CAN BE washed/sprayed onto/into clothing, 
especially any synthetic ware.</li> </ul> <br>

<h3>Permethrin Cautions (Proper usage requires prior clothing wash or spray 
application): </h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Cats DIE every year from flea and tick baths (containing Permethrin) 
meant only for dogs</b></li> 
<li>Kills ticks on contact, kills lice and some mites associated with mice 
carriers,<br>
 prevents mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and 
malaria and probably West Nile disease</li> 
<li>Travelers keep reporting that they are not bothered by insects while on 
tropical outings<br>
(when other people were bothered mercilessly) </li> 
<li><b>Is meant for clothing only (do NOT use on a living body)</b></li> 
<li>Is used by spraying clothing or dip washing clothing</li> 
<li>Seems to be effective up to six clothing washes</li> 
<li>Complements DEET which usually cannot be placed on clothing, especially 
anything synthetic</li> 
<li>Has seen prior Military and European exposure</li> 
<li>Is a relatively new insect repellent to the USA Public</li> 
<li>Is NOT for direct skin contact</li> 
<li>READ the instructions!</li> 
<li>Is TOXIC to Cats</li> 
<li>Do NOT leave treated clothing laying around where pets are a concern</li> 
<li>Has Low human absorption but has traced its way into breast milk </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Batteries and Battery Management:</h3> Top <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>The AA battery is the most common battery in the world. This knowledge 
should be applied to head lights, flash lights (torches), position lights, tail 
lights, cameras, and phones.</li> 
<li>Some people keep flashlight/headlight batteries opposed when not in use 
(plus to plus or minus to minus) which prevents accidental discharging and it 
slows down normal energy leakage.</li> 
<li> When spare batteries are placed in storage, tape or place them such that 
all positive ends are on the same side - This prevents slow energy leakage that 
occurs when positive ends are near negative ends, as those pesky electrons will 
jump across space and discharge the battery.</li> 
<li> </li> For the same reason, don't store batteries loose and don't store 
them near metal or other conductive materials (like carbon fiber).
<li>Always take advantage of an opportunity to charge rechargeable batteries, 
especially cell phones, cameras, and computers. Be aware that many lodging 
facilities have switches on the wall as well as the outlet and that they both 
have to be turned on in order to facilitate a successful electrical charge. 
Also, be aware that some hotels (with rooms having an electronic card key) turn 
off all electrical power to the room when the electronic key card is not 
inserted into the &quot;I'm-Home&quot; slot. Thus, when a person leaves the 
room and takes the key, the computer that was thought to be charging may be NOT 
charging at all, and, in fact, if it is powered up it will be discharging.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Carry Reserve Food:</h3> Top <br>
<br>
<b>Start a trip carrying some 
reserve food.</b> This action may allow cyclists to get moving or <i>keep 
moving at key times</i> and therefore not leave a person extra hurried or 
worried in case of a breakdown or other untoward situation.
<ul> 
<li>Because of International bans on shipping or importing food, particularly 
meat, cheese, and fruit we sometimes order pre-packaged meals from the country 
that we are visiting and have the packages shipped to the starting point 
(usually a B&amp;B or a Hotel). The typical military or civilian MRE (Meal, 
Ready to Eat) is often technically NOT legal to &quot;import&quot; into most 
countries (because they often contain meat). So the food pre purchase offers an 
immediate source of food or an emergency food reserve.</li> 
<li>We have made pre-arrangements with a B&amp;B or Hotel to hold our food 
delivery until we arrive in country and we pre-arrange to have the same 
facility hold our excess luggage for us while we bike tour. If they won't hold 
our food or gear for us, we will look for another place to stay. So far, with 
one exception, the B&amp;B's were quite willing and no Hotel has ever denied

<h2>Bicycle Crash Avoidance (See Crash Situations Ahead of Time):</h2> Top <br>
<br> 
<ol> BicycleSafe.com has about <b>30 specific suggestions for avoiding the 10 
most common Bicycle-Automobile types of accidents</b>. <i>Every cyclist should 
know these bicycling accident situations and avoidance solutions</i>. 
BicycleSafe.com is a<b>Defensive Cycling Education</b> and a <b>Bicycle Road 
Touring Survival Education</b> rolled into one education package. <i>Accident 
scenarios are reversed engineered</i> to the point of explaining when and where 
a cyclist could and should recognize an evolving accident situation (the road 
survival part) and explaining what course(s) of action that a cyclist could and 
should perform in order to avoid a collision (the defensive action part). Would 
the reader notice a car coming up from behind with its right-turn signal on and 
correlate that event with a side road to the right, about forty feet in front, 
and know what to do? The multi-part solution is described, in detail, at
BicycleSafe.com will prevent an accident and maybe save a life - <i>Suggestion

<h1>How to Survive a Bicycle Fall or Crash;<br>
Bicycle Fall/Crash Survival 
Lessons Learned (Minimize Injury):</h1> By <i>Dennis and Terry Struck</i> <br>

Top, <br>
<br>
 Lessons Learned the hard way from Bicycle and Motorcycle Crashes
<br> (Real Experience Shared by the Authors). 
<ol> 
<li>Always wear a helmet and gloves, period.</li> 
<li><b>Pay Attention!</b> Once a person is in a crash, stop denial and start 
looking for ways to minimize body damage.</li> 
<li><b>Keep the Eyes Open for as much of the event as is possible.</b><br>
 
Your eyes let you read the situation as it unfolds. Closing one's eyes is 
usually the action<br>
 that results in the most body damage and the longest 
recovery time.</li> 
<li><b>Be fluid</b>, if an object is going to punch the body, don't stiffen up 
for an impact, be loose and force the body to roll the body part along with or 
away from the punching object -<br>
<b>Move a body part along with a punch.</b>
<br> RESTATED: If someone were about to hit you in the face and the impact were 
imminent (it's going to happen - stop denial), does one stiffen up and take the 
impact (NO), one deliberately moves their head backward, thus minimizing force 
of the impact - One is going to be hit no matter what (SO actively minimize the 
damage!).<br>
<b>The more fluid a person is during a crash, the less the trauma 
of impact and the less the total injuries.</b><br>
 SEE: Mental Philosophy 
(below).</li> 
<li>If one is thrown off their bike, then rolling is usually the best course 
of action (assuming that a person is not about to go over a cliff or such - one 
still has to actively think).</li> 
<li>If something is moving toward the eyes or the face, then move the head<br>

 (rotate, twist, and/or bend).</li> 
<li>Be Active (as in Pro-Active). Be Alert.</li> 
<li>Frequently, there are things that a person can do, before coming to a 
rest, that may save one's life<br>
 OR minimize any injury.</li> 
<li>If necessary, use arm(s) or leg(s) to keep a person's falling/moving body 
from hitting dangerous objects.<br>
 Dodge Stuff, roll or twist if needed.</li> 
<li>Protecting the head is usually the most important thing to do, BUT<br>
 on 
occasion a person may need to focus on dodging a spearing/jabbing object.</li> 
<li>Keep the head off the ground. Interestingly, if a person is looking at 
what is<br>
 happening around their self, then a person will likely be forcing 
their head off the ground.</li> 
<li>Always be analyzing.</li> 
<li>The side (of the human body) can take the most Shock/G-Force (versus the 
front, back, top or head).</li> 
<li>If a person cannot land on their feet, running, then the next best crash 
position is to land on their side with the butt side of the hip (butt-hip 
corner), thigh side, slightly bent leg side, forearm and hand slap (together), 
all at the same time!<br>
 - Keep the chest, ribs, and head all off the ground.
<br> - Rotate, twist, and/or bend to make this happen.<br>
 - Be in a flowing 
fluid motion, not a statue.<br>
 - This is a Judo 101 Fall Position. It is 
worth taking one class, just to learn this maneuver.<br>
 - If a person yells 
&quot;Heiyee&quot; during this episode, they will double their energy, gain 
focus, and be in control - it works!<br>
<i>Domo Arigato Gozimus Dojo.</i> 
[Dennis was raised in Japan.]</li> 
<li>Do NOT allow yourself to be thrown on your chest and chin, use the arms to 
change the fall into a side impact.</li> 
<li>Avoid a stiff-arm side impact, or a stiff-leg landing.<br>
 Bend the 
appendages a little so the body parts won't break or be torn -<br>
 Airborne 101
(sneaky pun, intended).</li> 
<li>Avoid an impact force to the shoulder that is inline with the shoulder and 
neck.<br>
 Twist or roll to the back of the shoulder (or bones may break and/or 
components may be torn).</li> 
<li>If landing square on the butt, roll to one cheek or the other, Before 
hitting the ground. Force one's landing to one butt cheek or the other by 
rolling or twisting or using the legs and/or arms. Never hit the ground with 
both cheeks at the same time.</li> 
<li>We don't always get to pick how we are dismounted, but a summersault type 
body roll<br>
 (feet over head) is better than a chin slide or back slide -<br>

 Judo 201 Roll.</li> </ol> <b>Mental Philosophy</b> (Zen): During crashes, for 
helpful reasons that cannot be explained, Dennis tends to mentally view himself 
from a stationary position and the world is coming at him (almost like a video 
game); he then dodges obstacles and prepares for various impacts using the 
above listed reaction set/algorithms. <br>

<h2>Lightning Facts / Lightning Survival:</h2> 
<p> Top<br>
<br>
 We frequently find ourselves overnighting in high altitude 
places in the mountains or crossing mountain passes mid to late day when the 
thunder storms form up. We have learned to watch the weather for various signs 
(clouds, cloud types, temperature, and wind) and to pay attention to our 
surroundings (lightning struck trees and fire signs). Radio reports are never 
specific enough to help, except for reporting weather fronts.<b>We specifically 
look for lightning strike signs1 (scars on trees, twisted trunks, fire sign)</b>
 so that we know specific places to NOT be located during a storm. We have been 
in some very intense lightning storms and we have sat out many heavy duty 
thunder showers.</p> 
<p>Contrary to the popular expression, <b>Lightning not only hits twice, 
lightning hits some geographical prominent areas repeatedly</b>. So the reason 
that a cyclist/camper looks for lightening strike tree signs and burn areas IS 
TO AVOID THEM! Don't take shelter there, don't camp there!<br>
 LEARN TO READ 
THE SIGNS. &nbsp;1</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If a person is within thirty seconds of the sound of thunder of a 
lightning flash, then a person can be hit by lightning. Storm direction does 
not matter.</li> 
<li>There are two types of cloud to ground lightning strikes:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Cloud Bottom to Ground - The bottom of cloud is negatively charged and the 
lightning discharge seeks positively charged ground.</li> 
<li>Cloud Top to Ground - The top of the cloud is positive charged and the 
lightning discharge seeks negatively charged ground.</li> </ul> 
<li>The <i>Cloud Top to Ground lightning discharge is the Deadliest</i> and is 
often called a clear air lightning strike because the strike can easily be 5 
miles from a cloud (the distance record is 25 miles). This is the reason that 
swimming pools close at the first sound of thunder.</li> <br>

<li>Lightning is typically about 1 to 1.5 inches thick. It appears larger 
because the electricity has super heated the air and the moisture in the super 
heated air reflects the bright light and gives the appearance that the 
electrical bolt is 12 to 18 inches wide.</li> 
<li>Sometimes people can see the glowing effect of charged particles on the 
ground or a grounded object, like a tree, climb up towards the sky just before 
a strike. This activity is called &quot;Discharge Laddering&quot; or just 
Laddering for short.</li> 
<li>Sometimes a person can feel the Laddering effect on the body as a tingling 
sensation or as hairs standing on end. Sometimes the laddering effect can be 
seen or heard as little metal objects may vibrate (in your pocket or on a table 
top).</li> 
<li>There is <b>NO Safe Place Outdoors</b>. Closed vehicles offer some 
protection, Not because they are on rubber tires but because they have a steel 
cage and thick windows to block or deflect a lightning bolt. Hikers and Bikers 
Do NOT have any protection and must use their wits.</li> 
<li> NOAA (Melbourne, FL), near the Lightning center of the United States, on 
their NOAA Website, near the bottom of their online web page, states:
<ul> &quot;If a person is caught in the open and lightning is nearby, the 
safest position to assume is the Lightning Crouch. Crouch down on the balls of 
the feet, keeping them as close together as possible. Cover the ears, and do 
not allow other body parts to touch the ground. Keep in mind that this position 
should be used only as a<br>
LAST RESORT! <i>It WILL NOT guarantee safety!</i>
&quot;</ul></li> 
<li>Lightning does not always seek the tallest tree, it can hit any tree (or 
any other object for that matter) and lightning can strike the same object more 
than once. If there are trees around, while lightning often does discharge 
through a tree top it does not have to, it can go directly the ground, to a 
short tree, between trees, or go to or through any other object.</li> 
<li>Lightning can bounce off an object and discharge at a peculiar angle or 
distance. Lightning can also travel laterally along the ground, especially if 
the ground surface is wet.</li> 
<li>Ranchers have reported cows killed along a barbed wire fence, where 
lightning struck the wire elsewhere.</li> 
<li>Lightning can splinter into different sizes.</li> 
<li>True Stories: Terry got hit by a lightning splinter, the noise of the main 
bolt about six feet in front of her made her instinctively jump off the ground, 
which probably saved her life. Terry, as a child, also had a pet Lamb get hit 
by lightning, six feet in front of her. Dennis had a stack of fire wood blow-up 
about twelve feet in front of him, he had to duck spinning pieces of wood which 
hit a tin roof above him.</li> </ul> 
<h3>(1) When lighting hits a tree, one of four things happen (NOT Mutually 
Exclusive):</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Maybe Nothing (it happens).</li> 
<li>The lighting runs down one side of the tree and destroys the bark, leaving 
a streak scar of exposed tree interior. These trees usually live but the trees 
are stressed and will not hold up well to subsequent micro-biological plant or 
animal attacks.</li> 
<li>The tree can super-heat and twist on its hollowed cell fibers. The tree is 
dead. Details:</li> 
<ul> The lightning can super-heat the tree at the cellular level. As the 
heated cellular steamed liquid leaves the cell membranes, only the plant fiber 
structure remains. In less than a second, the steamed tree (life) liquid 
evaporates (or at least departs the cell) and lets the tree collapse onto its 
own hollowed cellular skeleton for support - The process of the tree collapsing 
onto its empty cell membranes results in the tree becoming shortened and 
twisted (about one turn for every 8 to 12 feet of height).<br>
<b>Foot Note:</b>
 Heat from a High-Intensity Fire, as in a large forest fire, can also cause 
this same<b>Death Twist</b> (see second pictures above). </ul> 
<li>Lightning can cause a fire in the tree or on the ground.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Bicycle Packing for Shipping or Transport:</h2> Top <br>
<br>
 The 
following presents a brief introduction of some bicycle packing, shipping, or 
transport issues.<br>
 For extensive detail, see Bicycle Packing, Transporting, 
and Shipping. 
<ul> 
<li>Traveling to Tour Destination, for two people, by flight, with bikes (one 
each): Two options, one for business, the other not:</li> <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>As a Business Expense:</b> Our personal limitation is four pieces of 
luggage (for two people) and two carry-on briefcases (one each). The first two 
pieces of luggage are the bike suitcases. The third piece of luggage contains 
the biking paraphernalia (helmets, all travel clothing, handlebar bags, 
cameras, extra bottles, toiletry kits, medicines, ...) - This is usually bulky 
space robbing gear but not heavy<i>per se</i>. The fourth piece of luggage is 
for the conference, the good clothes to be left behind with the briefcases (and 
the legal reason for the trip that makes the flight trip portion become a 
business expense). So since four pieces of luggage is all that we can handle 
(plus a strap on briefcase each) then the only variable is the weight - if a 
bag is over weight, we pay for it, we can't redistribute into a fifth bag as it 
usually is not allowed or we could not manage it if we were allowed, but we 
have redistributed between two bags (one over weight and one under weight). 
This is why we often leave travel books behind and why a good five page home 
made itinerary pays for itself. We are usually right at the weight limit for 
the grand total. (Some air lines are nicer about this than others, oddly the 
more enjoyable airlines seem to be more strict.) See next item.</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>As a Non-Business Expense:</b> If a flight trip for a bike tour is not 
for a conference or business purpose, then two bikes can be carried in two 
cases. The cases will become bike trailers. The bike accruements and travel 
clothing can then be carried in one or two duffle bags. Panniers can be stowed 
in duffle bags too. Thus, at the destination, the bikes come out of the 
suitcases and are assembled as touring vehicles, and the contents of the duffle 
bags (to include the panniers) either gets worn on person, mounted or carried 
on the bike, or the contents get stowed in the suitcase trailer. That means 
that the duffle bag(s) must be foldable and storable in order to be stowed in a 
trailer or pannier, that is, the duffle bag must be flexible and foldable with 
or without wheels.</li> </ul> <br>

<li>Remove panniers when transporting bikes on the exterior of a vehicle. We 
had one come off the bike's rack while traveling on a rough road and it got run 
over by the only other truck on the road.</li> 
<li>Almost every damaged bike, from shipping, was poorly packed or loose parts 
were not well bagged or not bagged at all so the result was lost parts or 
damaged goods.</li> 
<li>While we have yet to assemble a bike at an airport, we do make a quick 
inspection of the suitcase. If the bike is not assembled and validated for bike 
damaged at the air port baggage/shipping/cargo area, then a cyclist may not 
have any legal claim for damage.</li> 
<li>Commercial Airlines will not knowingly allow hydraulic fluids to be 
carried in bikes with hydraulic brakes. The fluid is supposed to be drained 
before shipping.</li> 
<li>Commercial Airlines recommend that flyers keep tires at least 15 PSI below 
the tire's recommended maximum pressure.</li> 
<li>Commercial Airlines will not allow a passenger to carry pressured air or CO
2 cartridge(s) on their person or in a carry-on bag. So far, it is still 
permissible to carry CO2 cartridges in the luggage.</li> 
<li>Some Commercial Airlines, like British Airways, allow 75 pounds per bag 
for International Flights while other Commercial Airlines only allow 50 pounds 
per bag.</li> 
<li>Some airlines will average or work from a total weight perspective and 
some airlines won't. Our Bike Fridays, with gear (almost with as much bike 
touring accruements as we can stuff in) seem to weigh-in naturally at about 50 
pounds (plus or minus 3 pounds) per suitcase. When weighing in at airports, we 
often need to move a few pounds from on case to another.</li> 
<li> <b>Story</b>: My wife and I watched a foreign baggage inspector pick up a 
packed BikeFriday in its suitcase and drop it on a counter top from about six 
inches, not being mean but being in a hurry. He opened the suitcase and saw the 
strange contents. He then focused on the Document that we set on top (the 
Suitcase Bicycle Picture Document - See Image) and he picked it up to look at 
the picture of the assembled bicycle. He immediately realized that the contents 
were the same thing as pictured (a fully assembled road ready bike). He then 
did some courtesy probing but from a point of respect. When he was done, he 
closed the suitcase and gently set it down for a baggage handler to pickup.</li>
<li>A big muddy cleanup may be needed at the tour's end. If needed, consider 
borrowing a water hose or visiting a car wash or a creek. If nothing else 
consider using the remaining water, water bottles, and a rag. Perform the 
cleanup as soon as possible so as to leave packing time and not have to address 
dirt or wetness issues.</li> 
<li>Always dry the bike as much as one possible can before packing or 
shipping. Given enough time spent traveling, everyone is eventually faced with 
a situation where they have to pack a wet bike. One usually has about 24 hours 
before rust sets. So make cleaning, drying, and oiling a priority.</li> 
<li>Mark storage bags, as applicable, with marker pen for contents. For 
Example: Front Rack, Steering Tube, Fork, Seat, Seat Mast, Seat Post, ...</li> 
<li>Mark the water bottle cages as front and rear if they are different. Bike 
Friday Z Key cages are different from non-key cages.</li> 
<li>At the tour's end, it is useful to have disposable rags, both for bike 
cleanup (dirt/mud removal) and for cleaning grease/oil/grime off of the drive 
train. We usually carry about five or six rags in a quart sized plastic bag. We 
discovered that we could buy washcloth sized cleanup rags for garage use by the 
case at X-Mart.</li> 
<li>We carry a small scrap plywood rectangle, about 3 x 7 inches, for the 
wheel off fork moments. The plywood mini block is particularly useful for 
supporting the fork while mounting the shock tube/unit to the bottom headset.
</li> 
<li>Plastic Sheet (scrap, tent ground cloth, or space blanket) for Bike 
assembly or disassembly (8 x 8 Feet ideal, 3 x 4 Feet minimum size). Usually 
the plastic tarp is for the assembler person(s) to sit on and keep loose items 
off of the ground/dirt and it seems to help keep passer-bye's from walking on 
or through the equipment on the ground.</li> 
<li>Spare plastic zipper lock parts bags, about 3 x 5 Inches (keep original 
shipping parts bags - we bought 100 count 3 x 5 Inch zip bags from Xpedex, $2).
</li> 
<li>Handi-Wipes (or equivalent): Set aside something to clean the hand(s) 
afterwards (their will be dirt and grease on fingers, we use 2 by 3 inch sized 
in foil type wipes, bought by the box from X-Mart).</li> 
<li>Bicycle tool bag/kit and Z key: Smart to open the tool kit and lay it and 
the Z key (Bike Friday's double ended 5 &amp; 6 mm S Wrench) directly under the 
frame. Usually tools should be one of the last things packed and one of the 
first things made available for reassembly.</li> 
<li>Don't pack tools or other hard or heavy objects on top of spokes or frame 
(as they may dent or scratch).</li> 
<li>The more remote a place and associated mass transportation system, the 
more friendly they are toward allowing bicycles on transportation vehicle. 
Please Note that there are many times when a person asks if they can carry a 
bike on public transportation, the answer will be &quot;NO.&quot; So that a 
cyclist won't be stranded somewhere, it is often best to not ask. It is better 
to bag and carry the bike(s). If the driver/conductor asks about what's in the 
bag, then the answer should be &quot;it is equipment&quot; or &quot;sporting 
equipment&quot; (bikes are sport equipment, one just don't say or show what 
kind of equipment it is and one keeps the bike sealed and covered).</li> </ul>
