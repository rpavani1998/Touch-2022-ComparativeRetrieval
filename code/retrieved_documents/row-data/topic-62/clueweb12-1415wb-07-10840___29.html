<h2>Visionary Nutrition</h2> 
<p><strong>Greetings Friends!</strong> I wanted to share an article by my good 
friend<em>Morgan Maher</em>, the host of the my upcoming online workshop on 
&ldquo;Visionary Nutrition&rdquo;. &nbsp;I think it is an inspired and poignant 
summation of the plant medicine path, and especially the<em>synthesis</em> of 
<strong>food</strong>, <strong>medicine</strong>, and the realm of <strong>
entheogenic plants</strong> in the human ecological niche. <em> If you are 
interested in joining us for this online workshop just click the banner below.

<p><em>Enjoy the article and let us know what you think!</em></p>

<h2>Food Medicine Life</h2> 
<p>by Morgan Maher</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;As we begin (once again) to naturalize ourselves &ndash; both 
nutritionally and medicinally &ndash; we may begin to discover that there is 
far more to a plant than just its chemical composition, more than just its list 
of constituent phyto-nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Rather, and more vital 
to our personal healing &ndash; as well as to the continuation of life as we 
know it &ndash; is our becoming acquainted with the organism producing the food 
or medicine itself. With the life-form, the being.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>-Daniel Vitalis</em></p> 
<p><em>~</em></p> 
<p>Visionary Nutrition. This is a path of uniting stories. An open source 
invitation into deeper relation with the many things that fuel, heal, and 
energize us; that which is alive all around us, co-creates<em>with </em>us. 
This a path of dissolving separation. A path of connectivity.</p> 
<p>It is the strengthened engagement with the harmony of humanity &ndash; the 
beautiful songs we&rsquo;ve sung and are singing, our peak performance, the 
best of the best &ndash; that boils down to our collective necessities &ndash; 
food, medicine, life &ndash; from which can be drawn ever-expanding analogies, 
inter-elated metaphor, and metamorphosis.</p> 
<p>It is here all around us; Eden, Heaven &ndash; find it in an apple. Got 
Demons? Join forces with a vine. Eat garbage conjured and sold by the darkest 
magicians &ndash; become &ldquo;Stay Puft Marshmallow Man&rdquo;; your 
ill-conceived nightmares. Invite the forces of nature, say an orange or a 
mushroom, and with the right kind of eyes &ndash; grow further infused with 
infinite ecologies of everlasting spirits.</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;What ayahuasca teaches is that right now, at every moment, we 
already live in the magic forest.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>-Steve Beyer</em></p> 
<p>Dig around a bit, and you might observe the root of our crisis as being 
humankind&rsquo;s long, drunken lust for separation &ndash; mind/body, 
human/nature, food/medicine, physical/spiritual. Simultaneously, it is these 
elements which<em>unite </em>our species, and always have. We all participate, 
we all dance with these elements &ndash; and it is these elements that, by and 
large, make up our world. We create worlds, as worlds creates us.</p> 
<p>But we <em>are </em>new here &ndash; sometimes awesome, but ultimately 
amateur, and we&rsquo;ve been grasping. We simply cannot believe it. Timelapse 
the situation and it&rsquo;s like we appeared only yesterday &ndash; 
instantaneously &ndash; in ever-changing form, on a particular planet.</p> 
<p>Growing in size, staring at our hands, finding our feet, rubbing our 
eyeballs, mind boggled &ndash; immersed, surrounded, and face to face with an 
overwhelming presence perceived, at times, as threatening.</p> 
<p>We dash for the door, or some way out. We invoke separation, like children 
covering their ears &ndash; convinced it&rsquo;s not happening. Running in 
circles, making mirages, chasing dragons, ouroborically awestruck, deaf, blind 
and dumbfounded by this life, the afterlife, reality and its alternatives, 
ghosts, dreams, philosophy, the powers that be, the secret life of plants 
&ndash; all this raging intricacy.</p> 
<p>Yet we appear now to see eye to eye with the storm. This quiet, ripping 
whorl, where time is in question, and of its essence. Where the consensus 
amongst the conscious is that we are indeed all one, we<em>are </em>nature, 
there is no separation, and it&rsquo;s all changing dramatically. Be ithomo 
nexus, homo luminous, neo aboriginalis, or Sylvapolitans &ndash; it&rsquo;s on, 
and it&rsquo;s your choice. Merge with the Maelstrom, let Gaia absorb you. 
Produce solutions &ndash; dissolve.</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;The fiction that supports the culture-nature separation is 
rapidly failing under the weight of its own inconsistencies. It is becoming 
obvious that what we do to nature we do to ourselves, what we do to ourselves 
we do to nature.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>-Morgan Brent</em></p> 
<p>All plants are psychoactive. Everything has a spirit. You can learn a lot 
from Arugula &ndash; even more from Cacao, or from an elder like Maize. What we 
place inside ourselves, transforms us. Eating and drinking is intimate 
communication. Daily comm-union, even telepathy, most often one-way, where a 
plant invited into the human body as food or medicine can &ldquo;see what you 
mean&rdquo;. From it nothing is hidden and it knows what&rsquo;s what &ndash; 
so it provides certain answers in the form of nourishment &ndash; literally; 
&ldquo;bringing (you) up, raising, fostering, supporting, preserving&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Be it food or information &ndash; we become what we consume, and we produce 
from the inside out. When we eat and drink &ndash; we practice relationship 
with different forces, with spirits and sentience. We are what we eat, and what 
we eat runs the show.</p> 
<p>Plants, fungi and bacteria are significantly adept at piloting humans. 
Michael Pollan, for example, explores this extensively and convincingly in his 
work, posing the question: &ldquo;What if we are all just pawns in corn&rsquo;s 
clever strategy game to rule the Earth?&rdquo;. Further, Pollan suggests, in 
his &ldquo;Plants-eye view&rdquo; Ted Talk, that &ldquo;Looking at the world 
from other species&rsquo; points of view is a cure for the disease of human 
self-importance.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If plants &ndash; specifically Teacher Plants &ndash; convey anything, it 
is that they have the upper hand, the higher branch. They can throw you down, 
clean you up, send you out to space, thrust you on a new paths, make you change 
your ways, whisper advice, keep you warm, dry, sheltered, alive, and in some 
cases, even kill you.</p> 
<p>Essentially, plants can do whatever they want with humans, and with 
near-absolute impunity. Our species&rsquo; &ldquo;ultimate verdict&rdquo; is 
the concept of death. But to a plant, death is laughable. A sentiment 
reinforced in a recent New York Times Magazine article describing the plant 
take-over of New Orleans&rsquo; Lower Ninth Ward, where &ldquo;For six and a 
half years, the neighborhood has undergone a reverse colonization &mdash; 
nature reclaiming civilization.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Have you ever seen plants <em>happen? </em>Plants, and plant-time, are like 
crop circles (which of course are made of plants in most cases) &ndash; like 
magic, they appear, leave traces, clues, fruit, messages. In the New Orleans 
&ldquo;Jungleland&rdquo; &ndash; behind climates of chaos and the media 
newsfeed, burnt cars and dead bodies are consumed by tall grass.</p> 
<p>Side with the plants, learn plants, eat plants, <em>become </em>plants 
&ndash; let food be your medicine, let medicine be your food &ndash; and begin 
to synthesize entirely different dimensions of time, technology, communication, 
and potential.</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;In order to live a magical life, you have to eat magical 
food&rdquo;<br>
 -David Wolfe</em></p> 
<p>Several years ago, during <em>dieta </em>with Ayahuasca, the plants 
suggested to me that &ldquo;ayahuasca would go best with raw food&rdquo;. 
Plants, I&rsquo;ve found, often speak in terms of one&rsquo;s present 
perception &ndash; in shapeshifting symbols that change as you follow them, 
conversations to discern and decipher. With this in mind, I set forth exploring 
a raw food diet &ndash; with sharp eyes and a healthy aversion to dogma and 
definitions. However, the heart of this guidance was clear: Ayahuasca, once 
drank, prefers to live in, and works better with; clean bodies.</p> 
<p>I eventually engaged and evolved my raw food/living diet path as a kind of 
inverted version of a<em>Plant Dieta. </em>Something I could practice daily as 
a way to learn from, and build relations with numerous &ldquo;common&rdquo; 
plants like Kale, Chard, Chia, Blueberries, Tomatoes, Pears, for example. As 
though I was, or have been, turning myself into some kind of garden. Into 
which, ayahuasca digs deep, purging junk, transforming thoughts, composting 
things, creating soil from soul, turning the stomach into a womb, encouraging 
conditions right, good, and fertile &ndash; so it can root, grow, and flower.
</p> 
<p>Raw, living diets take many forms. From my perspective it&rsquo;s a kind of 
plant artistry. Plant-based edible living sculpture with vibrant living beings 
who in return sculpt you. Essentially though, it is process of healing and 
strengthening. Significantly, it&rsquo;s a<em>cleanse </em>&ndash; of body, of 
mind &ndash; and by extension, environment.</p> 
<p>From yet another direction, the &ldquo;higher reflection&rdquo; in a sense 
the<em>Mother </em>of raw, living diets, can be seen in the traditions and 
disciplines of<em>Plant Dietas. </em>Commonly referred to and often mistaken as 
&ldquo;the ayahuasca diet&rdquo;<em>- Plant Dietas </em>are, in <em>very </em>
general terms; a discipline and process of cleansing, purging, healing, 
learning, and building right-relationship. During<em>Plant Dietas, </em>one is 
isolated, eats very little, and/or very simply, in order to remove 
distractions, sensitize one&rsquo;s body/mind/spirit to the subtleties of the 
spirit world, to become transparent, lucid and focused in it. A student-teacher 
relationship emerges as one sits with a plant, drinking it exclusively over a 
period of time.</p> 
<p>Working safely and respectfully with Ayahuasca and other Teacher Plants, 
alongside raw food/garden-variety plants, the Teacher&rsquo;s Assistants so to 
speak, leads, of course, to many physical and spiritual benefits. The plants 
led me out of concrete jungles, cured any concrete ideologies and crumbling 
health I might carry &ndash; hold my gaze and engage my commitment to unfolding 
endeavors of evolutionary advantage &ndash; wild foods, living water, 
permaculture, forest gardening, medicinal mushrooms, herbalism, 
synaesthesia&hellip;</p> 
<p>Yet perhaps most importantly, the process has opened, and continues to 
expand, a certain grand<em>permeability &ndash; </em>pathways and bridges 
between common ground and the sky &ndash; between day-to-day and ceremonial 
nights.</p> 
<p><em>~</em></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;I think that once a person is aware of the life in everything, 
they can begin to access the spirit of everything. And once they can do that 
they can interact with those spirits. I&rsquo;m talking about the spirit of the 
creek, the bricks in your house, the hundreds of spirits roaming your kitchen.
</em></p> 
<p><em>This universe is full full full of life and life force. The roll of 
shamanic knowledge for us westerners introduced to those spirits is to spread 
that knowledge, make communication easier. And if we can do that&ndash;a big 
task, no doubt&ndash;then the way people interact with the world and the 
spirits of the world and universe will change, automatically, from one of 
dominance to one of cooperation. And when we, mankind, begin interacting with 
the world, rather than trying to dominate it, well, I think mankind will be 
better off. The world and its spirits don&rsquo;t really care if we do, for the 
most part. Trees will be here long after we&rsquo;re gone, and so will stones 
and bricks and clouds and the moon. So it&rsquo;s really up to us to take an 
interest if we are to make the friendship of those spirits.</em></p> 
<p><em>And thus far, for most of us throughout mankind&rsquo;s short history 
on this planet, that effort has not been made. Which has left us losing out on 
so much we might have learned. Who knows what we have missed simply by not 
asking a plant what benefit it might have for mankind, rather than saying 
&ldquo;tree, chop it and burn it for fire.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>I think the universe has all the secrets of the universe. And our 
arrogance in trying to continually conquer the universe rather than communicate 
with it, has kept us from being taught those secrets. And how delicious they 
might be!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>It was a tremendous honor to be a part of the new documentary film <strong>
&ldquo;Hungry For Change&rdquo;</strong>. &nbsp; <strong>Click here to see the 
full length film for FREE between now and March 31st!</strong> The film exposes 
the myths and mistruths that the diet-fad and processed food industries have 
perpetrated on a mis-educated populace for so many years. &nbsp;We are now 
awakening from the last few decades of over-fed / under-nourished slumber and 
collectively reclaiming our Sovereign Health! This film is a beautiful 
depiction of how that is happening. &nbsp;I really feel that this movie has the 
potential to make some real change in the lives of people you know, so please 
turn your friends and loved ones onto it as well!</p> 
<p>Join me on my upcoming radio show with Patrick Timpone on <strong>March 
29th at 10 am EST</strong>. &nbsp;I will be talking about everything from the 
&ldquo;<em>best foods available in the super-market</em>&rdquo; to the &ldquo;
<em>worst food that people are eating today</em>&ldquo;. &nbsp;We will also be 
talking about footwear, and why I am such a fan of five-toed shoes! &nbsp;This 
will be a fun call, and Patrick is never shy about taking me into edgy and 
interesting territory! &nbsp;You can check out lots of my past interviews with

<p>Also, special thanks to my friends at Evolver for inviting me to be a part 
of the<em>Visionary Nutrition</em> project, <strong>beginning on April 8th
</strong> with my interview, where I will be teaching about <strong>the role of 
psychoactive plants in the human ecological and dietary niche</strong>.  Homo 
sapiens have a long and rich history with psychoactive plant medicines, and 
they have always been a part of our traditional diets. &nbsp;What role do 
psychoactive&rsquo;s play today, and if they are no longer represented in our 
food supply, is it possible that we can become &ldquo;alkaloid 
deficient&rdquo;? &nbsp;This online workshop will delve deeply into human 
domestication and the affects of an alkaloid-poor diet. &nbsp;Click here to 
learn more about this upcoming online event.</p> 
<p><strong>I will be speaking in Washington, DC at the Take Back Your Health 
Conference on April 14th and 15th!</strong> Please come visit me and the

<h2>Pine Pollen Book now available!</h2> 
<p>Greetings ReWilder&rsquo;s!</p> 
<p>I am really excited to announce the release of the new book &nbsp;
&ldquo;Pine Pollen, Ancient Medicine for A New Millennium&rdquo;, &nbsp;by 
Stephen Harrod Buhner. &nbsp;I had the privilege of both publishing this book 
as well as writing the foreword, and am very excited to see it added &nbsp;to 
the existing herbal literature.</p> 
<p>This project began a few years back when I read Stephen&rsquo;s outstanding 
book &ldquo;The Natural Testosterone Plan&rdquo;. &nbsp;Actually, I was reading 
a few of his books and found myself particularly spellbound by the section on 
Pine Pollen and its incredible androgenic effects. &nbsp;My company,SurThrival, 
became the first to bring a fully developed Pine Pollen product line to the 
natural foods market place in North America. &nbsp;I had met Stephen at a 
workshop he gave in British Columbia (here is an interview I did with him) and 
having become friends, asked if he would be willing to collaborate with myself 
and the SurThrival team on a Pine Pollen herbal-monograph. Stephen, having 
studied Pine Pollen extensively, had much to share on the subject. &nbsp;The 
results are his latest book which you can find here.</p> 
<p>Stephen was sure to include extensive sections on the historical use of 
Pine Pollen in various traditional medicine systems, its chemistry, as well as 
its androgen profile, dosages for use, and yes&hellip; &nbsp;Even how you can 
harvest your own! &nbsp;The entire book is extensively footnoted so that you 
can access the scientific literature from which so much of this information has 
been compiled.</p> 
<p>The following is a short excerpt from the opening pages of the book:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Although the Western world has been undergoing its greatest herbal 
renaissance in over a century the medicinal actions of trees are often 
overlooked, perhaps none more so than pine. Given the drive for new plant 
medicines and the continual search for a new herb-of-the-day that will simulate 
excitement in the general populace (e.g. rhodiola, maca), it is astonishing 
that pine has been unrecognized for so long. This is particularly perplexing 
since the pollen of pine trees has been used for millennia in China and Korea 
as both food and a particularly powerful tonic and adaptogen, especially for 
the elderly.</p> 
<p>Thousands of Chinese herbs have entered the Western pharmacopoeia; the 
earliest and best known is perhaps ginseng. Pine pollen, given its potency, its 
similarity to ginseng in some of its actions, and its status as, perhaps,<em>the
</em> premier phytoandrogen on the planet, should have been recognized long 
before now as the powerful medicinal it is. This monograph is intended to 
remedy that oversight and help establish it as one of the most important 
medicinals in the herbalist&rsquo;s repertory.&rdquo; &nbsp;- Stephen Harrod 
Buhner</p> 
<p>I suspect you will all enjoy this book as much as I have enjoyed being a 
part of it. &nbsp;Stephen, in addition to being a prolific writer on herbal 
craft and lore, is a poet and word-smith par excellence.</p> 
<p>To your health and prosperity,</p>

<h2>Is Hollywood ReWilding?</h2> 
<p>Greetings Friends &amp; Welcome to 2012!</p> 
<p>This past autumn was a really exciting time for my team and I, with so many 
of our projects coming to fruition and our message of<em>ReWilding</em>, <em>
Spring Water</em>, and <em>Indigenous Nutrition</em> spreading around our 
community and beyond, faster than we ever imagined.</p> 
<p>I want to extend a big thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Longevity Now Conference</em> 
for all they have done to make this happen. Check out this 12 minute video clip 
(click on the image below) of the talk I delivered in Costa Mesa last October 
titled,&nbsp;<strong><em>&ldquo;Developing Sovereign Health: The Path of 
&nbsp;Rewilding Ourselves&rdquo;</em></strong>.<strong> </strong>If you would 
like to see the rest of thetalk, as well as those presented by the rest of the 
Longevity Now speakers,&nbsp;<strong>it is available here.</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Rewild Yourself: Tips &amp; Tricks for Strengthening Your Epigenetic 
Health&quot;</p> 
<p>I also want to share this <strong>quick video clip</strong> of my good 
friend Shailene Woodley&rsquo;s appearance on the<strong><em>Late Night With 
Jimmy Fallon Show</em></strong> (check out that clip right here)! &nbsp;She was 
so kind as to mention my name and the work I have been doing the last several 
years! &nbsp;Shailene has become a tremendous ally, helping to share the 
message of<em>ReWilding</em>, <em>Spring Water</em>, and <em>Indigenous 
Nutrition</em> with the world. &nbsp;Recently, she also appeared on the Ellen 
Degeneres Show carrying a mason jar of spring water which she promptly shared 
with Ellen!</p> 
<p>Here is a recent interview with her in Black Book Magazine titled 
&ldquo;Eating Clay and Super Humans&rdquo;! She talks about <em>foraging</em>, 
<em>spring water</em> and her daily <em>clay consumption!</em></p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know Shailene&rsquo;s work, check out her latest film,
<em> <strong>The Descendants</strong></em>, where she co-stars alongside <em>
George Clooney</em>. &nbsp;<strong>Shailene, from all of us, Thank You for all 
that you are doing!</strong></p> 
<p>Lastly I want to share the link to the newly rebuilt SurThrival website! 
&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great place to stock up on great winter immune system 
supplements, such as Medicinal Mushroom Extracts and Colostrum. &nbsp;I am so 
proud ofSurThrival as a project, as a company, and as a team! &nbsp;<em>Thanks 
to all of you who have supported us!</em> We are constantly working to serve 
you better!</p> 
<p>Thats all for now!</p> 
<p>Keep on ReWilding Yourself!</p>

<h2>Neti Pots: Nasal Irrigation to Smog-Proof Your Sinuses</h2> 
<p><em>How is your sinus hygiene?</em></p> 
<p>After 14 years of using a neti pot on a regular, almost daily basis &ndash; 
I must admit, I am amazed how overlooked this basic bit of personal hygiene is.
</p> 
<p>Most of us brush our teeth and we usually expect the same of others. 
&nbsp;In fact, when someone neglects this important bit of personal 
cleanliness, the rest of us can be easily turned off.</p> 
<p>How about bathing? &nbsp;What if you knew someone hadn&rsquo;t showered or 
bathed in months, years, or worse still, never at all&hellip; &nbsp;How would 
you feel about getting&hellip; um, close to them?</p> 
<p><strong>Well, how about our sinuses?</strong> Each day we are all breathing 
the many stow-away particles (read: pollutants) that free float amongst what 
was once, some pretty fresh air here on planet earth. Today our air is loaded 
with everything from dust (which is mostly dead skin cells) to heavy metals, 
from car exhaust to radioactive isoptopes. &nbsp;These particles are constantly 
lodging in and congesting our upper respiratory tract, creating an environment 
for infection and/or being drawn still deeper into our lower respiratory tract 
(our lungs). &nbsp;The neti pot gives us the ability to clean our upper 
respiratory tract, in much the same way that a toothbrush cleans our mouth or a 
shower washes our skin, before these particles can accumulate or be drawn 
deeper.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, we simply carry this debris around, haphazardly sneezing or 
blowing it out, or letting it drain back into our throats&hellip; &nbsp;Blah!
</p> 
<p><em>Want to see what a truly clean upper respiratory tract feels like? 
&nbsp;Try using a neti pot!</em></p> 
<p>After a few days, to a few weeks, of implementing this practice it will 
become immediately clear why I am recommending it. &nbsp;My experience has been 
that you can only truly feel the chronic congestion after you have cleared it. 
&nbsp;It is the open, clear, and relaxed sense of breathing; the ability to 
fully utilize your respiration that makes you conscious of its importance. 
&nbsp;In other words, once you have tried it and felt what clean and clear 
sinus cavities feel like, you won&rsquo;t want to go back.</p> 
<p><strong>As for the technique and specifics, I will let this video explain 
the rest.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My company <strong>SurThrival</strong> recently started carrying what we 
feel are the most beautiful and durable ceramic neti pots available anywhere, 
and<strong>you can get one for yourself right here</strong> on our newly 
designed website (we are pretty excited about this)! &nbsp;We were sure to get 
them in several different colors so that you can choose one thats right for 
you. &nbsp;These are made right here in the State of Maine (where we are based 
out of) and I have personally tested them now for almost a decade and a half, 
so I can honestly tell you they are the best around. &nbsp;Watch the video 
above where I compare some of the features against other design-styles.</p> 
<p>If your looking to smog proof your sinuses, help to prevent sinus issues in 
general, and improve your respiratory health, give the neti pot a try. &nbsp;
<em>Better yet, take some time to develop mastery of this skill by making it a 
regular practice!</em></p> 
<p>My hope is that our community will immediately see the value of this handy 
little device and add it to the tool-belt of practices and skills that are 
helping us&nbsp;to thrive in, and adapt to our modern environment. &nbsp;I 
promise if you give it just one week of consistent practice, not only will you 
easily master this skill, but you will have a life long practice that will 
contribute to your health and personal detoxification strategy.</p> 
<p>I have used this strategy, along side others, such as regular sauna use 
(check out&nbsp;<strong>Clearlight Saunas</strong>, it is the brand of infrared 
sauna that I have in my home), a clean whole food diet containing lots of wild 
foods and herbs,drinking natural spring water, implimenting regular functional 
exercise, all combined with and tied together with time spent in nature.

<p>On this interview, Daniel will be speaking about&nbsp;his latest research 
into the<em>reclassification</em> of modern humans as a new subspecies. 
&nbsp;It is a wild new idea that comes from the effects our modern lifestyle 
has had on our epi-genome and our health. &nbsp;Because our epi-genetics are 
influenced by everything in our environment, the lifestyle we have lived has 
shaped us into some new and all together different creature. &nbsp;The concept 
of &ldquo;<em>rewilding</em>&rdquo; is about <em>recreating</em> or replicating 
some of our natural conditions to make us<em>healthier</em> and more <em>robust
</em>. &nbsp;Daniel will be&nbsp;sharing tips on the kinds of things a person 
can do to rewild themselves and what it could mean to our health.</p>

<h2>Sovereign Dental Health, a 6 Part Strategy</h2> 
<p>Hello Friends,</p> 
<p>Welcome (or welcome back) and thanks again for stopping by. &nbsp;My last 
few videos have been focused on sharing some&nbsp;Sovereign Self-Healthcare 
strategies that I have been developing and employing for some time now. 
&nbsp;It has been really exciting to share these with you all, and for me it 
feels like a timely message, given the considerable distrust and 
dissatisfaction so many of us have been feeling for mainstream 
&ldquo;medicine&rdquo; in recent years.</p> 
<p>Many of us have taken our diets and nutrition into our own hands, though 
when it comes to personal health care, few of us have really stepped out and 
away from the entrenched medical system&rsquo;s doctor/dentist treatment, and 
the role we play in it as &ldquo;patient&rdquo; (from the Latin meaning 
&ldquo;suffering&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>This current video is a 6 part dental health and maintenance strategy that 
has replaced the role of dentistry in my life. &nbsp;It has been many years 
since I have seen a dentist (I was 12 the last time I can remember having an 
appointment with one), and as it is with so many aspects of living, I have 
found it far more rewarding to take care of myself, rather than turning my 
health over to others. Especially those &ldquo;quacks&rdquo; &ndash; originally 
a term reserved for dentists who employed mercury amalgam fillings &ndash; with 
less than shiny-white histories (e.g. fluoride, mercury, etc).</p> 
<p>The world of &ldquo;modern medicine&rdquo;, to include modern dentistry, 
seems far less interested in our health than it does in furthering its 
quasi-scientific agendas, human experiemention, and profit driven procedures. 
&nbsp;For this reason I will continue to promote Sovereign Self-health Care 
Strategies here at DanielVitalis.com.</p> 
<p>ReWild Yourself! This doesn&rsquo;t refer to behaving wildly, or 
&nbsp;giving up your standards of personal conduct, rather it means &ldquo;Shed 
your Domesticator&ldquo;!</p> 
<p>This video is for all of you who celebrate being grown-ups, and are 
unafraid to raise yourselves up and out of the near ubiquitousneoteny that is 
now standard in the epi-genome in our &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; population.</p> 
<p>This video comes on the heels of&nbsp;the last video we released, which 
details how to make the toothpaste that is used in this dental care strategy. 
&nbsp;Please keep in mind that this toothpaste, in addition to providing the 
mild abrasive qualities we have become accustomed to in our commercially 
available toothpaste preparations, is designed to pull toxic cations out of the 
body, and to be an aid in our overall radio-protection strategy (protection 
from radioactive isotopes).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For those of you who are interested in going deeper, I would highly 
recommend an e-book by my good friend Nadine Artemis called<strong>
&ldquo;Successful Self-Dentistry, how to avoid the dentist without ignoring 
your teeth&rdquo;</strong>.  This e-book is very comprehensive, and empowers us 
to take our dental health into our own hands for a lifetime.</p> 
<p>We are now getting ready for Ancestral Ignition, a workshop that myself and 
some good friends are hosting here at my home in Maine,<strong>September 16th 
&ndash; 18th, 2011</strong>. &nbsp;The main focus of this retreat is to share 
the<em>ancient</em> and <em>ancestral</em> skill of aboriginal friction fire 
with all of those who attend. &nbsp;We really believe that stewardship of this 
ancient fire-craft is valuable for many reasons, not the least of which is the 
carrying on of what is one of our most ancient and fundamental human 
technologies.</p> 
<p>Our ability to generate and maintain fire is a <strong>powerful</strong> 
thing indeed, so it is our intention to pass on not just the skill, but the 
ethics of stewardship as well.</p> 
<p>We also feel privileged to share the basics of fire-craft with our friends 
and clients because so many of us were never taught how to properly or 
efficiently build or maintain a fire. &nbsp;I certainly wasn&rsquo;t, growing 
up in the 1980&rsquo;s American Dream. &nbsp;In fact, learning to properly 
construct and burn a fire has meant far more to me than just having another 
survival skill. &nbsp;It has connected me with one of the essential practices 
that makes us human.</p> 
<p>This workshop will be fully catered with <strong>organic</strong>, <strong>
local</strong> food, prepared by Chef Frank Giglio, who is one of my best 
friends and a truly culinary mentor of mine.</p> 
<p>Check out the video below to hear more about <strong><em>Ancestral Ignition
</em></strong>, and to see acclaimed botanist, author, and my foraging and 
aboriginal skills guide and&nbsp;all around friend,&nbsp;Arthur Haines, make a 
fire with a primitive tool known as the bow drill.</p> 
<p></p>

Ignition please contact us atinfo@danielvitalis.com.</h4>

<h2>How to make your own Detoxifying Toothpaste, and details on my annual trip 
to Peru</h2> 
<p>Greetings Friends, thanks for stopping by.</p> 
<h3>Would you like to make your own toothpaste for self-dentistry and 
detoxification?</h3> 
<p>The video below is an installment in dental health sovereignty. &nbsp;It 
has been working very well for me, and it just might work for you too.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For years I have been looking for the right toothpaste for my home 
self-dentistry, and have experimented with a great many things. &nbsp;From 
&ldquo;organic&rdquo; store-bought toothpaste brands, to tooth soaps and 
powders, and even aboriginal &ldquo;chew sticks&rdquo; &ndash; Nothing has been 
the right fit for my self-dentistry needs.</p> 
<p>I have now arrived at a strategy that is really working wonders for me, and 
I feel could really work for you too. &nbsp;This video is the first part of 
that strategy, the rest of which I am eager to share with you in full over the 
next few weeks.</p> 
<h3>How I arrived at this&hellip;</h3> 
<p>As I began experimenting with tissue detoxification using Zeolites and 
Clay, it dawned on me that these, when rendered into a fine flour-like powder, 
have just the right amount of abrasiveness to take the place of the toothpaste 
I had grown up with.</p> 
<h4><em>This video details how you can make your own, and at a very low price 
at that. &nbsp;In fact, if you know where to look, you could get everything you 
would need for making all the toothpaste you would use for the rest of your 
life for probably under $100!</em></h4> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Best of all, you can swallow this toothpaste, which yields all of the 
amazing health benefits of these detoxifying earth compounds. &nbsp;In 
particular I am referring to zeolites ability to perform cation exchange -&nbsp;
CEC or Cation Exchange Capacity is the term used in physics- which is its 
ability to electrically bind positively charged ions (heavy metals, 
radio-isotopes, etc) whilst trading out (in exchange) beneficial cations like 
potassium or calcium. &nbsp;The toxic cations are then transported out of our 
bodies, along with the zeolite powder in our bowel movement. &nbsp;The case 
with clay is very similar, though the phenomena in this case is referred to as
adsorption, which is also an electrical binding, but in this case to the 
surface of the clay particle and without the accompanying exchange of a cation.
</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that this practice, consuming clay and other earth compounds, 
is perhaps one of the oldest of all human behaviors. &nbsp;It has been 
practiced around the world and is present in virtually all pre-industrial 
populations. &nbsp;Evidence for this has been found in archeological sites that 
predated our current human form, and anthropological surveys have found that it 
lives on in societies around the world today. &nbsp;Actually, it is common to 
nearly all mammals, and in particular to broad ranging herbivores. &nbsp;The 
behavior is termed&ldquo;geophagy&rdquo;, and is unquestionably part of the 
species-specific diet of human beings. &nbsp;From my perspective, it appears 
that a diet that lacks the geophagy pattern could not be called a 
&ldquo;natural diet&rdquo; at all, as it would essentially be deficient in 
these all-important compounds. &nbsp;Below is a link to one of the best books I 
have read on the subject.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>  null <br>
 null </p> 
<p>Most of us were taught to spit our toothpaste out, which, given the host of 
less-than-beneficial ingredients (particularly fluoride) is pretty sound 
advice. &nbsp;With this home-made clay or zeolite toothpaste, the goal is 
indeed to swallow it, moving it into the intestine where it can go to work 
mopping up industrial and nuclear debris that has bioaccumulated in our tissues.
</p> 
<p>When this clay or zeolite consumption&nbsp;is combined with sauna therapy 
(this dual approach is the subject ofmy last video), we arrive at a very 
effective life-long detoxification strategy that really works, and is easy to 
implement.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>This second video is about my August 4th, 11 day tour of Peru, for which I 
have just a few openings left.</h3> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you are looking for a riveting adventure, are interested in Peruvian 
shamanism, amazonian biology, visiting Machu Pichu, or just wanting to soak in 
a rain forest hotspring, this trip might be for you. &nbsp;We are less than a 
month away, so if you would like to join us &ndash; by us I mean the very 
amazing and interesting group of people who have assembled for this trip 
&ndash; contactJeannette at info@rawflora.com, and check out the 11 day 10 
night itinerary here. &nbsp;It is exciting to see who takes the plunge and 
comes along!</p> 
<p>Please let us know what you thought about the video above, and if there are 
any subjects you would like to see covered in the future.</p> 
<p>Until then, please know that your readership is appreciated.</p> 
<p>Enjoy the summer sunshine!</p>

<h2>Looking for Some Inexpensive Radiation Detoxification?</h2> 
<p>Greetings and thanks for visiting!</p> 
<p>Your time here is very appreciated. &nbsp;The video that accompanies this 
blog post is a two part strategy breaking down how you can inexpensively and 
easily begin protecting yourself from the long-lived radio isotopes, which have 
now become a regular part of our habitat. &nbsp;This began 65 years ago, and 
has become particularly disconcerting in the last few months since the damage 
to the Japanese facility at Fukushima.</p> 
<p>I am also including here the two links that I mention in the video. &nbsp;
The first is an amazing visualization that shows all of the nuclear detonations 
that have happened on Earth since 1946. &nbsp;Hint&hellip; &nbsp;its over 2000!
</p> 
<p>The second is a documentary called Trinity, and it shows with nothing less 
than truly epic footage, the history of these tests. This, if you have time, is 
a must see! &nbsp;Very disturbing, but strangely entrancing&hellip; &nbsp;I 
guess that is the nature of this technology.</p> 
<p>The reason I share these videos and information is to demonstrate that the 
issues with radiation did not begin Fukushima, or even with Chernobyl, but with 
the &ldquo;silent&rdquo; nuclear war that has already happened on Earth.</p> 
<p>So what do we do? &nbsp;This video is about the strategies that I have been 
employing since the Japan disaster earlier this year. &nbsp;Knowing what I know 
now, I wish I had started the day I came into this world. &nbsp;Regardless, 
taking actions like these has put me at considerable ease about the 
radio-isotopes in our environment. &nbsp;This allows me to operate without 
fear, but remain in a dominant emotion of confidence.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Also, on another note, my opening evening talk at the Longevity Now 
Conference last April is now available for purchase in DVD format, in an 18-DVD 
set which includes the lectures from each of the other health educators who 
spoke at the Conference! &nbsp;The DVD set is a compilation of hours, upon 
hours, of live footage from the weekend long event and includes tons of the 
latest health information and inspiration. &nbsp;Click here to see a 15 minute 
clip of the my main lecture from the event, titled &ldquo;Habitat, Living the 
Life of Our Biological Design&rdquo; which I feel came out wonderfully! 
&nbsp;To learn more about this excellent DVD offer or to purchase your copy 
today,follow this link.</p> 
<p>Thats all for now, though I eagerly await your comments, so please let me 
know what you would like to see future videos on!</p> 
<p>Thank You for taking the time. &nbsp;Keep SurThriving!</p>

<h2>Invincible Health at the Kripalu Center</h2> 
<p>Hello Friends,</p> 
<p>Join me in Western Massachusetts&rsquo;s celebrated Kripalu Center May 20th 
&ndash; 22nd for our Invincible Health workshop, a weekend of inspiration, 
invigoration, and community building with other&rsquo;s who share your 
passions, your insights, and your lifestyle.</p> 
<p>What an opportunity it is for me to spend three days with you amidst 
Kripalu&rsquo;s gorgeous spring settings, with its wonderful food and renowned 
staff. &nbsp;Three days gives us time to deeply explore the lifestyle that is 
the theme of this workshop.</p> 
<p>There is so much I am excited to share, from creating and implementing a 
healthy and well developed natural diet, to finding the cleanest and purest 
water available to keep your body hydrated. From creating healthy habitat 
within your own home, to protecting yourself from the radioactive fallout that 
is, even now, blanketing the northern hemisphere. &nbsp;This will be a robust 
and fully developed workshop covering hundreds of aspects of personal health 
sovereignty, loaded with tips, techniques, and strategies for those of us who 
are ushering in the new paradigm on earth.</p> 
<p>I am expecting this to be a very intimate event, with lots of time for 
personal exchanges, questions and answers, and exploration of territory that 
isn&rsquo;t always easy to cover in a one night talk.</p> 
<p>Today I have been considering what an honor it is to be a part of this 
great change that is taking place here on our planet, and in ourselves. &nbsp;I 
truly believe that the generations alive today are uniquely positioned as the 
gate keepers of an emerging world.</p> 
<p>That said, each of us faces innumerable challenges to our health everyday, 
from the simple habituated patterns that have been passed on to us from the 
generations past, to more complex issues like genetically modified foods and 
radioactive fallout that have emerged more recently as a result of our rapidly 
developing technologies. &nbsp;We all require training and education in order 
to successfully navigate a transitioning world that sometimes seems -strangely- 
designed to corrupt our health, our values, and even our will.</p> 
<p>But&hellip;.</p> 
<p>What if there was a lifestyle that protected your health, increased your 
ability to express your personal potential, kept your body clear of industrial, 
agricultural, radioactive and genetic pollution, protected your fertility, your 
stamina, your libido, and increased your will and desire to care for all of 
life? &nbsp;I really believe there is such a lifestyle, and living it is so 
much more exciting and rewarding than the life that most of us were born to.</p>
<p>In fact, not only does this lifestyle exist, I feel that many apects of 
&nbsp;it will be as common to people in the coming decades as taking a shower 
or brushing your teeth is today. &nbsp;In fact, aspects of it will have to be 
implemented if we are to continue to inhabit this world. For instance, methods 
for removing radioactive isotopes from our body fat, muscles and bones, 
pcb&rsquo;s and other industrial chemicals from our lipid stores, and keeping 
genetically modified bio-pollutants out of our bodies will become as common 
place as removing plaque from your teeth or dirt from beneath your fingernails. 
&nbsp;They will have to, as these things are rapidly destroying the integrity 
of our immune systems, our ability to reproduce, and even riddling our bodies 
with cancers. &nbsp;For us to continue, for us to clean up the mess we have 
collectively made, we will have to, as a species, choose to walk down a new 
path. &nbsp;Many of us already have, and are.</p> 
<p>Eating well grown local food, drinking clean, fresh water, breathing clean 
and uncontaminated air, and receiving brilliant sunlight on our skin will once 
again become the norm, and again, this just might come about -for many at 
least- out of necessity before want. &nbsp;We do not and will not have any 
other options left. &nbsp;The lifestyle that dominates the &ldquo;developed 
world&rdquo; today is wreaking havoc on our immunity, our endocrine systems, 
our neurology, our physiology and even our psychology.</p> 
<p>If you are reading this, I assume you are part of the change that is 
coming, and I commend you. &nbsp;If you would like to deepen your training, 
move further down this path, develop skills that can protect and nourish you 
and the generations to come, please consider joining usMay 20th-22nd in the 
Berkshire Mountains.</p> 
<p>Lets explore the awakening, forge a path into the new paradigm 
together,&nbsp;and let&rsquo;s do it in a place as beautiful as this.</p> 
<p>Here is a little bit more information on the event, as well as the Kripalu 
Center itself.</p> 
<p>Thanks for visiting and I hope to see you there,</p>

<h2>SurThrival into the 21st Century</h2> 
<h3>Adaptation: the process by which an organism becomes better suited to its 
environment. &nbsp;</h3> 
<h3>And now its more important than ever!</h3> 
<p>I believe we are standing on the edge of a truly profound event horizon, 
one that holds within its grasp the seed of the greatest human evolutionary 
renaissance since our species first emerged into the world some 200,000 years 
ago.</p> 
<p>More than ever before, every choice we make, each and every action we take 
is leading us onward to thrive or downward to our own demise.</p> 
<p>Our environment is changing faster than our minds can keep pace with, and 
this change is pressuring our biology to adapt at what are now nearly break 
neck speeds.</p> 
<p>Oil in the seas, nuclear fallout spreading across the globe, shortages of 
food, genetic and degenerative disease, antibiotic resistant infectious agents, 
mass extinctions, epidemic infertility, genetic modification, electro-smog, 
etc, ad infinitum.</p> 
<p>Can any of us adapt fast enough? &nbsp;I believe some can, and whats more, 
that some will.</p> 
<p>The question remains, what will separate those who go on to inherit the 
Earth from those who&rsquo;s genes will fade into the recess of geologic 
history.</p> 
<p>Those who remain will have to be more than survivors, they will be&nbsp;
SurThrivalists.</p> 
<p>The SurThriver understands the health challenges inherent in our modern 
world, and yet chooses to Thrive despite them. He or She has the ability to 
witness events like those that recently struck Japan, and while maintaining a 
sense of empathy and compassion, takes the necessary steps to protect 
themselves, their health, and that of those they love.</p> 
<p>The SurThrivalist differs from the Survivalist in that they operate from a 
place of love and recognition of the inherent bounty of the natural world. 
&nbsp;The SurThriver believes in and aligns themselves with Life. &nbsp;The 
survivalist too often operates from a place of fear and uncertainty. 
&nbsp;Survival is bare minimum, SurThrival is abundant, and even opulent.</p> 
<p>Make no mistake, we stand before the greatest evolutionary event our 
species has ever known. &nbsp;Now is the time &ndash; our time &ndash; to seize 
this opportunity and sail it into the future!</p> 
<p>In full honesty, I don&rsquo;t believe that most of &ndash; or even many of 
&ndash; the human beings alive today will carry forth their genetic material 
into the future. &nbsp;In fact, it seems to me that the only humans who will be 
able to inhabit this planet soon will be those who have developed and 
implemented strategies to thrive in this brave new polluted planetary ecology. 
&nbsp;In other words, those who can keep their bodies clean and detoxified, 
nourished and healthy, no matter what the level of contamination.</p> 
<p>What does all this mean? &nbsp;It seems to be some kind of natural (or 
perhaps unnatural) selection.</p> 
<p>Natural Selection is a simple enough concept. &nbsp;Those individuals who 
are more adapted to a particular environment will be healthier and will produce 
more offspring than those less suited to an environment. &nbsp;In the 
environment we now live in, with its extremes of climate, toxic foods, 
petro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals, polluted air and water, etc, only those who 
have developed strong, wise, and strategic methods for thriving will be able to 
carry forth their genetic material and live through this phase of history to 
populate the new and coming world.</p> 
<p>I believe in us, I believe in our ability as a species to make it through 
even the most challenging times. &nbsp;We are up against something so much more 
powerful than any natural disaster, we are up against our selves. &nbsp;We have 
created a world so very far outside of the balances of natural law and it is 
now time that each one of us reestablishes a new equilibrium within ourselves. 
&nbsp;It might not be easy, though that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be 
exciting &ndash; and yes&hellip; maybe even fun.</p> 
<p>I will be teaching a three day workshop at the Kripalu institute in western 
Massachusetts May 20-22nd of 2011, called Invincible Health, the intention of 
which is to develop in each participant a strong desire to Thrive combined with 
the knowledge necessary to take their health into their own hands with poise 
and grace. &nbsp;You can find the details of that event here.</p> 
<p>We will be covering a very comprehensive lifestyle approach that can 
&ndash; and I believe will &ndash; give one the confidence to step into the 
world each day with a sense of abundant growth, rather and fear and uncertainty.
</p> 
<p>Food, Water, Air, and Sunlight, are the critical elements for nourishing 
our bodies, and we will be covering these topics in depth. &nbsp;Chemical and 
Radiation exposure, EMF&rsquo;s, xeno-estrogens, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, and 
a host of other health pitfalls will also be addressed to ensure that each 
participant can protect and detoxify themselves from these safely and 
adequately. &nbsp;We will literally cover healthful living from conception to 
the grave and beyond. &nbsp;I promise a profound and moving experience in this 
workshop.</p> 
<p>This workshop is the three days long, just enough time to share an entire, 
coherent, and well organized method for insuring your SurThrival into the 21st 
century, and I am feeling very honored for the opportunity to do so. 
&nbsp;Please consider joining me there next month. &nbsp;We have priced this 
event very resonably, and I look forward to sharing a message of empowerment, 
resolve, wisdom, and health with all who attend.</p> 
<p>Keep SurThriving, the world is your inheritance.</p>

<h2>Coconut Water in Maine??? The First Wild Food of the Season!</h2> 
<p>Ok, so of course Maine hasn&rsquo;t got any coconuts, but we do have 
something that tastes just as good &ndash; maybe better &ndash; and is just as 
nutritious.<br>
</p> 
<p>Its the sap of the Maple tree. </p> 
<p>There are not many wild foods that taste particularly sweet here in New 
England, but Maple Syrup is certainly the exception. &nbsp;Whats more, the 
flowing sap of the maple tree is the first wild food to emerge after a long and 
cold snow covered New England winter.</p> 
<p>This video is a quick peek into my spring cleansing strategy which is most 
welcomed after a lengthy season of living indoors. &nbsp;The fresh Maple sap is 
so refreshing, so hydrating, and tastes so good that it is almost shocking that 
more people aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of this delicious, abundant, and free 
late winter/early spring drink! &nbsp;In the second half of the video 
I&rsquo;ve included a recipe that I have been making with fresh maple water, 
chaga, and a bit of cream. &nbsp;I wish there was some way to convey flavor 
through the internet! Is there an app for that yet?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To compliment and expand on my video, I have also included a video with 
botanist Arthur Haines detailing how he taps his maples, and prepares his maple 
syrup. &nbsp;With childlike enthusiasm, we have been texting back and forth 
each day to see how much sap the others trees have produced!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The experience of procuring food directly from wild nature is truly, for me 
at least, one of the great joys of living! As each season goes by and my skills 
in this area increase, not only have I developed a strong sense of food 
security, my direct relationship to the Earth as an abundant and loving 
provider continues to increases. &nbsp;To say that I am grateful would hardly 
do justice to this exuberant emotion.</p> 
<p>For those of you who are interested in developing more wild food 
identification, harvesting, and processing skills, please consider joining 
Arthur and I for ourAncestral Plants workshop here in Maine, May 6th &ndash; 
8th, 2011. &nbsp;Be sure to contact us soon, as the class size is very limited. 
We have chosen the intimate class size to ensure that each of you gets the 
close personal attention you need, and to ensure that we don&rsquo;t trample 
our wild foraging grounds. &nbsp;The class has been filling up rather quickly 
these last few weeks, and we are getting very excited for the spring foraging 
to begin!</p> 
<p>I have a few more days of maple sap harvesting before heading of to Los 
Angeles for the Longevity Now Conference, April 1st -3rd. &nbsp;I have just 
finished preparing my presentation, called &ldquo;Habitat, Your Guide to 
Intentional Lifestyle Design&rdquo; which will focus on specific strategies for 
more than just vigorous health, but epi-genetic wealth. &nbsp;In other words, 
we can use our environment and lifestyle to activate our genetic potential for 
a more robust experience of life on Earth! &nbsp;The newly emerging scientific 
field of &ldquo;epigenetics&rdquo; is rapidly confirming the obvious fact, our 
habitat and lifestyle choices, from what we eat and breath to what we wear and 
think not only impacts our health but actually influences our gene expression! 
&nbsp;Many of you are already planning on being there, and those who would like 
to join canget your tickets here. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t make it to the

<h2>Urban Foraging Florida!</h2> 
<h1>The Brazilian Pink Peppercorn</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p>Tampa Bay was the site of another example of an urban forage, and this time 
with an exotic invasive that produces more food than I could ever hope to 
harvest.</p> 
<p>Branches bowed under the weight of pinkish-red berries as I sped across the 
highway on a recent trip to Southern Florida last December. &nbsp;Hour after 
hour I burned to know and meet the species who&rsquo;s berry drupes splatter 
painted pink the otherwise indistinguishable wall of sub-tropic greenery that 
lined the &nbsp;highway 75. &nbsp;Was it edible, and if so could I make the 
time to harvest some of it before my flight home? &nbsp;Finally curiosity got 
the better of me, and I decided to do what any avid forager would &ndash; 
&nbsp;I &nbsp;pulled over to have a taste. &nbsp;I know what your thinking, 
shouldn&rsquo;t I identify the plant<em>before </em>I taste it? &nbsp;Probably, 
but I didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;I have a good sense of the tastes of poisons, and 
this strategy has rarely failed me ( I will spare you the tale of the time I 
tried a taste of &ldquo;Jack-in-the-pulpit&rdquo;. &nbsp;Ooops!) &nbsp;The 
exotic sweet and spicy aromatic flavor of these brittle pink berries was well 
worth the risk, and I was certain I was on the trail of a new wild food ally.
</p> 
<p>It only took a few moments of internet research to discover the identity of 
this wildly successful invasive.&nbsp;It was Schinus terebinthifolius, the 
Brazilian Pink Peppercorn, and while not a true peppercorn, it is the pink 
berry we all have seen in the high end peppercorn blends and fancy see-through 
peppermills.</p> 
<p>This plant, once planted ornamentally is&nbsp;now Southern Florida&rsquo;s 
most noxious invasive, and today is illegal to plant, sell, or transport within 
the state! &nbsp;It is quickly claiming more and more habitat for itself, 
displacing native species from their long held habitat.</p> 
<p>And while this presents ecological issues in Southern Florida, it produces 
a tremendous surplus of wild food for the keenly aware forager. &nbsp;One of 
the great things about a plant like this, is there there is no concern of over 
harvest. &nbsp;Due to its status as Florida&rsquo;s floral-enemy-number-one, we 
can harvest its berries with a kind of impunity that is rarely experienced by 
the modern forager.</p> 
<p>Having harvested several pounds of these beautiful pink peppercorns, they 
are now dried and jarred, and have become a staple of my ever increasingly wild 
food rich diet. &nbsp;They provide an exotic spiciness to any dish, from sweet 
to savory, and they come with the added percieved benefit of being from my own 
personal harvest.</p> 
<p>While I hadn&rsquo;t had personal experience with this plant before, I do 
have plenty of experience with the principles of wild food identification, 
harvest, and processing, and each of these skills translate well from biome to 
biome, from one eco-system to the next.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in developing this skill set as well, or if you have 
experience but are ready to go deeper please check out myAncestral Plants 
workshop this May in Southern Maine! It is 3 days long, catered by Chef Frank 
Giglio with all local organic and wild food, and taught by myself and wild food 
expertArthur Haines. &nbsp;It is the wild food apprenticeship you have been 
waiting for! &nbsp;I hope to see you there!</p> 
<p>In the meantime, check out the video below to see the harvest and 
processing of these beautifully blush bunches of berries!</p>

<h2>David Wolfe, Matt Monarch, and Daniel Vitalis Make a Smoothie Spoof!</h2> 
<h1>Whats the World&rsquo;s Best Kept Health Secret???</h1> 
<h2>Being able to laugh at yourself! &nbsp;Let me explain&hellip;</h2> 
<p>This week has been full of just that kind of laughter! &nbsp;For the last 
couple of weeks myself and several good friends and great acquaintances have 
been working together diligently to get the word out about the 16 DVD set that 
was filmed last September at the Longevity Now Conference in Costa Mesa, CA. 
&nbsp;There has been a friendly rivalry going on, and a few of us decided to 
take it as far as we had to in order to bring the most attention to these 
DVD&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It sort of turned into an informal contest, and I was 
determined to win&hellip;</p> 
<p>It all started last week with my team and I brainstorming about how we 
could get peoples attention. &nbsp;I needed to do something out of the 
ordinary, something bold and hilarious. &nbsp;This is what I came up with, and 
if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, I would love to hear your opinion.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My girlfriend Ali, my operations manager and brother Kaleb, and my Best 
Friend and Business Partner LeighLon and I then spent several hours posting 
this video to everyone we could think of in our social networks. &nbsp;It was a 
huge hit, and got a few thousand views in its first 24 hours! &nbsp;People were 
loving it, but the competition was swarming and before we knew what to do, 
several other videos popped up. It was our friends and colleagues trying to 
out-do us (special thanks toJason Wrobel and Ron Obadia) with videos of their 
own!</p> 
<p>We went back to the drawing board.</p> 
<p>I needed something fresh, something bold, something that would send ripples 
coursing throughout the health-minded community&hellip; &nbsp;I had an idea, 
but would this be going to far? &nbsp;Was what I was about to do; was I 
crossing the boundary? &nbsp;Did I even dare?</p> 
<p>No&hellip; &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;I was going to 
back down. &nbsp;I was defeated.</p> 
<p>Then, suddenly I was flooded by a deluge of emails. &nbsp;It was my friends 
from the Longevity Now Conference. &nbsp;They wanted to know if I, Daniel 
Vitalis, was the kind of person to retreat into shadow, to fall sullenly into 
obscurity, or would I rise like the proverbial Phoenix from the ashes of video 
doldrums to deliver the masterpiece that the world had been waiting for?</p> 
<p>Text messages from my close friends David Wolfe and Chef Frank Giglio 
started rolling in. &nbsp;They told me that I had until midnight to get 
something onto youtube, if I was to regain my honor. &nbsp;It was 9 p.m., and 
time was running out. &nbsp;I had just a mere three hours to make some magic.
</p> 
<p>The few hours that followed are little more than a blur, and if it 
wasn&rsquo;t for the record kept in the footage I am about to share with you, I 
would&rsquo;t have believed that it even happened. &nbsp;None the less, it will 
now be immortalized forever.</p> 
<p>What follows is a spoof of myself, David Wolfe, and Matt Monarch all 
hanging out in my kitchen making the &ldquo;Longevity Now Conference 16 DVD Set 
Superfood Tonic Elixir Smoothie&rdquo;&hellip;</p> 
<p>I play all of the parts, and keep in mind that this was made on an extreme 
time budget. &nbsp;Each character had to be filmed separately and I had to 
shave between each filming session. &nbsp;I can hardly believe this is 
real&hellip;.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the message here? &nbsp;Is there a message?</p> 
<p>Please allow me to summerize. &nbsp;For years now the three of have worked 
seperately and together in the same general arena and field. &nbsp;Each of the 
three of us represent extrememly driven and productive individuals. Each of us 
has spent countless hours employing personal development strategies to fulfill 
the blueprints for who we truly are and what we want to share with the world. 
&nbsp;Though each of us is very different, there is a common theme that we all 
agree on, and that is wanting to see a healthier, more peaceful, and more 
beautiful world for everyone.</p> 
<p>As public speakers and figures, there is a tremendous amount of pressure 
placed on us from all directions, as this is the nature of the work that we do. 
&nbsp;It can be so easy to find and focus on the differences in what each of us 
is teaching and if we are not careful, to allow ourselves to be divided by it. 
&nbsp;It is easy to lose sight of the obvious; that we are all friends and 
working<em>together</em> toward a common goal. &nbsp;The differences between us 
are beautiful and healthy, and ultimately what make this whole ride so much fun.
</p> 
<p>I think of it like this, imagine that David Wolfe, Matt Monarch, and I all 
walked into a restraunt together (ok, what restraunt would that be? &nbsp;I 
guess this is hypothetical). &nbsp;Each of us orders something different from 
the menu, something that is suited our own unique taste, preference, whim, and 
health goals. &nbsp;The fact that we ordered different dishes does not mean we 
are in nutritional opposition to one another. &nbsp;It does not mean we are 
contending with one another, and certainly doesn&rsquo;t affect our friendship 
or support of eachother. &nbsp;None of us would be wrong for what we ordered, 
it is just a menu after all. &nbsp;We can each enjoy our meal together over 
laughter and appreciation for each others company.</p> 
<p>A second message I have embedded into this video is the following: 
&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t take life or yourself too seriously. &nbsp;Ever.</p> 
<p>All three of us are so focused on creating the life that we desire, each of 
us so good at what we do, that we have all become characters as archetypical as 
those found in the pages of a comic book. &nbsp;This deserves to be laughed at 
sometimes&hellip; &nbsp;Its funny.</p> 
<p>David the globetrotting shamanic mad scientist, Matt the California beach 
boy turned South American land owner, Me the elven borreal forest primitive 
locavore. &nbsp;This is the stuff comedy is born of! &nbsp;Each of us is simply 
bringing forward the health strategy that has fueled our unique missions and 
passions, and each of us does this in our own unique style. &nbsp;Our work is 
the distillation of years of study and practice, and we could be celebrating 
the diversity that this has created.</p> 
<p>There are times when we all come together for work and play, and when we 
do, all of these apparent differences are set aside. &nbsp;We are friends first 
and foremost, and we know the value of love and laughter.</p> 
<p>You the reader may have encountered some of the harassing internet trolling 
that each of us has had to endure. &nbsp;There are those online who<em>do</em> 
take this far too seriously and are constantly leveling accusations, and cruel 
and harsh words against us. &nbsp;They take our work and contort it in an 
attempt to make a mockery of us. &nbsp;What is funny to me, is the way that 
these people seem to do this as a near full time job! &nbsp;They are so 
obsessed, and take it all<em>so seriously</em> that they have committed their 
lives to displaying hatred and spewing vitriol, claiming that their way, their 
method, their diet, is the only viable truth. &nbsp;This video is a message to 
those people. &nbsp;It says &ldquo;You can never make fun of us better than we 
can of ourselves!&rdquo;, and that living without humor in your life is more 
than ugly, it is unhealthy and violates one of realities prime directives. 
&nbsp;Honestly, I feel sorry for people like that, people who are too closed 
down in their hearts to display the lightness of being that initiates human 
bonding. &nbsp;It seems like a cold way to live, and very, very lonely.</p> 
<p>Though people may at time level criticisms against us, I ask that you 
imagine this. &nbsp;Imagine the fearlessness it takes to put yourself out there 
to the world. &nbsp;Imagine what it takes to make videos, write books, travel 
the world getting in front of hundreds and thousands of people to share a 
message of hope and healing in a world so full of suffering and destruction. 
&nbsp;It takes a lot, and it is not always easy.</p> 
<p>To those who have supported us all these years, THANK YOU.</p> 
<p>Oh, and one other thing, a message to the haters&hellip; &nbsp;I am making 
a joke about the sales of this DVD for this reason alone. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t 
understand why there are people who are critical of me or anyone in my field 
for being a business person. &nbsp;How would I be able to do what I do if I 
otherwise had a full time career doing something else? &nbsp;Also, I feel the 
need to point out the obvious here: People buy products from myself or my 
colleagues because we carry extremely good products, products that help people. 
&nbsp;People choose to purchase these products because they add value to their 
lives and health, and because they feel good about putting their money back 
into the economic networks that support what they believe in.</p> 
<p>We exist as businesses because we carry things that people want. &nbsp;That 
should be obvious, though there are those that detract from this. &nbsp;Perhaps 
it is because they make their money in ways they are not so proud of.</p> 
<p>The businesses that each of us run are beautiful, thriving, life promoting 
operations and each of them is working to support the vision that each of us 
share for the world. &nbsp;My company,SurThrival, is my contribution to peoples 
health and healing and is my way of operating economically in a world that 
demands this of me. &nbsp;I am proud of the work that I do there, and of the 
people that this business supports. &nbsp;David Wolfe and hisLongevity Warehouse
 exists to support peoples health and developement, and is critical to keeping 
the message alive and available. &nbsp;I am proud to work with him. &nbsp;Matt 
Monarch has ceaslessly brought more and more products to us at hisRaw Food World
, and runs one of the tightest ships I have ever seen. &nbsp;I am proud to work 
with him.</p> 
<p>In closing, I want to say this. &nbsp;The Longevity Now Conference 
DVD&rsquo;s are amazing. &nbsp;I feel very good about sharing these with you 
because I know how much quality information they contain, and how diverse that 
information is. &nbsp;Each speaker is very different from the others, and holds 
a piece of information that could be the piece that you are looking for. 
&nbsp;These DVD&rsquo;s are not for the dogmatic; they are for the open minded 
and adaptable! &nbsp;One of those DVD&rsquo;s is dedicated to the talks that I 
gave at the conference, and is the information that is most on my heart and 
mind now. &nbsp;I truly hope that you get the chance to watch these, as this is 
why I do what I do. &nbsp;I believe in their value.</p> 
<p>If you would like to get yourself a set, click here now!</p> 
<p>Also, I will be at the Longevity Now Conference in April (1st-3rd), and 
will be making tickets for the upcoming conference available soon&hellip; 
&nbsp;So&hellip; &nbsp;Stay tuned, I might just be forced to top this last 
video!</p>

<h2>New Book Now Available! Ancestral Plants</h2> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Finally, a Wild Food and Medicine book that really delivers!</h2> 
<p>My good friend Arthur Haines has just released his new book Ancestral 
Plants, and I must say, it is amongst the best wild food and plant-use book I 
have yet to come across. &nbsp;People are constantly asking me to recommend a 
book on the subject, and there just haven&rsquo;t been many that I have found 
particularly helpful. &nbsp;Either the pictures weren&rsquo;t clear, the text 
wasn&rsquo;t informative enough, the author was lacking real experience, or the 
book just wasn&rsquo;t laid out in a user friendly way (ok, Samuel 
Thayer&rsquo;s books are an exception to these criticisms, and are excellent 
wild food references).</p> 
<p>Ancestral Plants is different, this book just seems to have it all. 
&nbsp;Arthur writes from a place of profound understanding of the nutritional 
and medicinal actions of wild foods, as well as the important uses that these 
95 plants held for the native people of this continent (and still do for the 
&ldquo;neo-aboriginal&rdquo; today).</p> 
<p>Since I received my first copy (just a couple of weeks ago on the Winter 
Solstice) I haven&rsquo;t been able to put it down. &nbsp;Thats not hype, I 
have literally been taking it everywhere. &nbsp;This book has become part of my 
everyday kit. &nbsp;And even though it is winter here, I have been studying up 
on the plants I want to learn in the next growing season, as well as using the 
calendar in the back to determine when I will be harvesting the key plants I 
intend to use throughout the year of 2011!</p> 
<p>One of the things I really appreciate about it is that it is written as 
more than just a wild food guide, it is a plant medicine guide as well, 
detailing herbal uses of these plants in addition to their uses as foods. More 
than that, it also lays out which plants may be useful as a fire resource (for 
friction fire, tinder etc), for cordage (plants that contain fibers that can be 
removed and braided in to cord), archery uses (woods that are optimal for 
making bows or arrows), and even uses like dyes, glues, and basketry.</p> 
<p>Ancestral Plants uses a series of icons to denote the possible uses of a 
plant &nbsp;(a little fire icon for plants with fire uses, an arrow for plants 
with uses in archery, etc), and then the text details how, when, and which 
parts of a plant can be used in this way. &nbsp;The photos are very clear and 
the descriptions have been written by someone who has actually used the plants 
to the ends described therein (believe me, this is not the norm).</p> 
<p>This is <em>the</em> go-to book for understanding wild plants of the North 
East, and the one that will accompany me into the field this year and for years 
to come (mine is getting dog-eared already).</p> 
<p>Also, I want to let you know that though this book was written for plants 
of the North East, dozens of the plants here will &nbsp;be found throughout 
North America, and even beyond. &nbsp;I think that foragers of all skill level 
and in a variety of eco-ranges will benefit from this work. &nbsp;Also, this is 
an excellent resource for herbalists or those interested in herbal medicine, as 
each plants pharmacology and mode of action are broken down in a very explicit 
and comprehensible way. &nbsp;It has already become one of my most valued 
herbal references.</p> 
<p>This book was published by Anaskimin, (the Penobscot native word for 
&ldquo;acorn&rdquo;) a nonprofit organization here in Maine, who&rsquo;s 
purpose is the protection of open and wild spaces through public and private 
education. &nbsp;Not only is this book the most useful and user friendly I have 
seen on the subject, but by purchasing it you are directly supporting the 
preservation of remaining wild places in a radical new way, by educating people 
how to care for and interface with wild nature.</p> 
<p>Also, as a heads up, Arthur and I will be leading two weekend workshops 
together this year in the North East, one in May called &ldquo;Ancestral 
Plants&rdquo; and another in September called &ldquo;Ancestral Ignition&rdquo;. 
&nbsp;The first will be a three day wild food education, identifaction, 
gathering, processing, and preparation workshop! &nbsp;The second will focus on 
the creation of fire from friction, using natural materials from the landscape, 
the way it was done for the last 400,000 years. &nbsp;I am very excited about 
both of these classes, and will be posting the details shortly. &nbsp;Stay 
Tuned!</p> 
<p>Check out the video interview below to learn more about the book, and click 
here to get your copy now! You will gain tremendous knowledge and be supporting 
a wonderful and important cause.</p> 
<p>Today is the first blizzard of 2011 here in Maine, and I am off to enjoy 
the snow! &nbsp;Thanks for visiting and please let me know what you think of 
the book!</p>

<h2>Join Me In Costa Rica March 13th &ndash; 20th!</h2> 
<h2></h2> 
<h2>What are you doing this March?</h2> 
<p>Happy New Year, both Solar (winter solstice) and Gregorian (Jan 1st)!</p> 
<p>I am home in Maine, and gearing up for the headlong plunge into the frigid 
depths of another New England winter! &nbsp;I get so excited every time it 
snows here, and though some people find it challenging to live through this 
kind of cold and dark, I must say that even more than loving it, &nbsp;I am 
fascinated by it. &nbsp;Watching the season change, feeling the solar low just 
before we emerge into the spring, seeing the tracks of the animals who move 
like ghosts through this icy, crystalline landscape, all of this brings out the 
wonder of a child in me!</p> 
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t appreciated a reprieve, and a chance 
to charge up my blood with Vitamin D from the Equatorial Sun just before spring 
begins (ok, the trip actually concludes<em>on </em>the Spring Equinox)!</p> 
<p>I will be teaming up again with RawFlora this year for a one time only 
Costa Rican adventure, and have a limited amount of space available for those 
who want to have a special experience at the tail end of this year&rsquo;s 
winter!</p> 
<p>As you can probably tell, I am an avid &ldquo;foodie&rdquo; so I have made 
sure there will be an abundance of fresh local fruits and vegetables, wild fish 
and seafood, as well as local goat milk and cheese! &nbsp;And one of my 
favorites, fresh water coconuts to drink all day long! &nbsp;We will have an 
experienced chef on hand to prepare our meals, and keep us fueled up for our 
exciting and dramatic daily excursions!</p> 
<p>Our lodge sits directly on a private tropical beach, where the Noni trees 
grow abundantly to meet the gentle lick of the Caribbean Sea. &nbsp;Each day is 
packed with truly exciting adventures, from visits to cacao plantations to 
white water rafting down a deep jungle river, from a forest canopy eco 
adventure to visits with the local shaman for healing jungle herbs. &nbsp;All 
this will be supported by our outdoor training withTai Chi Master Dr. Bob Bacher
 (He trained extensively in China, and has taught Tai Chi for over 40 years)!
</p> 
<p>This is the Life Affirming New Year Resolution trip you have been quietly 
desiring, and this is your chance to make it a reality! &nbsp;Come play with us 
in paradise as we explore the bounty of the PachaMama (Mother Earth)!</p> 
<p>All of the trip details are available here! &nbsp;There will be just one 
tour, and space is extremely limited, so please contact us immediately at 
info@rawflora.com to reserve your space!</p> 
<p>While I get to meet so many of you out on the road when I am teaching 
around the world, this is our chance to spend a full week together, exploring 
the wonders of this beautiful planet! &nbsp;I look forward to meeting you, and 
the special few who attend!</p> 
<p>See you there!</p>

<h2>Sauerkraut Fermentation At Home</h2> 
<p>For those of us who are developing or returning to our ancestral health 
through traditional and indigenous nutritional practices, few food preparation 
skills are as valuable to possess as lacto-fermentation.</p> 
<p>Imagine for a moment living without a fossil fuel driven infrastructure to 
deliver us our &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; veggies in January and an electrically 
powered refrigerator to store them in, and its importance and relevance becomes 
clear. &nbsp;Storing vegetables for the winter is a critical skill, and 
lacto-fermentation has some advantages that are hard to beat.</p> 
<p>For instance, Lacto-Fermentaion actually <em>increases</em> the amount of 
nutrition that was present in the vegetable alone (by converting sugars into 
protein rich bacterial bodies, B vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids), increase 
the bio-availability of the existing nutrition (by breaking down cell walls by 
predigesting the vegetables cellulose, and removing anti-nutrients) and all the 
while preserving the inherent nutrition better than freezing, canning, or 
drying!</p> 
<p>Lacto-fermentation, the kind of vegetable fermentation that produces foods 
like sauerkraut (as well as kimchee and brined pickles), preserves our food in 
lactic acid, and was one of the dominant preservation techniques used by our 
ancestors before sugar&nbsp;and preservatives became the norm. &nbsp;The 
primary fermentative organism present in these kinds of preserves is&nbsp;
lactobacillus acidophilus (who&rsquo;s name means &ldquo;acid loving milk 
bacteria&rdquo;) one of our bodies primary microbial&nbsp;symbionts.</p> 
<p>Not only does lactobacillus acidophilus allow us to preserve and even 
increase the amount of nutrition in our vegetables, but it also aids in 
digestion and increases our immunity too! &nbsp;Lactobacillus takes up 
residence in our small intestine, creating a kind of probiotic bio-shield in 
the gut, where it aggressively out-competes other dys-biotic organisms that can 
cause us to fall ill.</p> 
<p>Ok, so forgive me here, but I am going to interject a few definitions and a 
quick mathmatical formula. Trust me, it will help.</p> 
<p>Prebiotic + Probiotic = Synbiotic. &nbsp;Easy right? &nbsp;Here is what it 
means.</p> 
<p>The thing we intend to ferment is known as a &ldquo;prebiotic&rdquo; (I am 
using this term loosely, don&rsquo;t tell the scientists), this is the food 
source (sugars) for the organisms that will be converting the food into a 
fermented-food (in our case cabbage). &nbsp;We add to that the 
&ldquo;probiotic&rdquo; organism (these are healthy, symbiotic micro-organisms) 
that will be performing the fermentation (here it will be lactobacillus). 
&nbsp;Ok, a little caveat, we might not actually add the probiotic, but rather 
let it colonize itself, in what is called a &ldquo;wild fermentation&rdquo;, as 
is the case here with sauerkraut. &nbsp;Organisms native to the area where you 
are fermenting, or &ndash; as is the case with cabbage &ndash; are indigenous 
to the food itself. &nbsp;Through the alchemy of the fermentative process 
something new will be created, and that new thing is known as the 
&ldquo;synbiotic&rdquo;. &nbsp;I want to emphasize, the synbiotic is a new 
food, not the sum of the original parts, this is why sauerkraut is not 
&ldquo;cabbage&rdquo;, and wine is not &ldquo;grape juice&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Synbiotics like sauerkraut have long been used by those before us to 
fortify their immune systems, assist in digestion (their acidity helps to lower 
the pH of the stomach increasing the effectiveness of our hydrochloric acid), 
and to maintain healthy levels of the probiotic organisms that colonize our 
digestive lumen. &nbsp;While many people use probiotic supplements in an 
attempt to achieve these ends, most often lacto-fermented foods perform these 
tasks better, can be made at home from whole, fresh, local foods, are 
inexpensive, and add a considerable amount of quality nutrition in the form of 
highly absorbable predigested, living food. &nbsp;Oh, and they taste great too!
</p> 
<p>For me, lacto-ferments like sauerkraut are one of my primary ways of 
preserving and consuming local vegetables through out the long Maine winters. 
&nbsp;Aside from the occasional Whole Foods splurge, I don&rsquo;t suspect I 
will be eating very many fresh green vegetables until the wild spring shoots 
emerge after the thaw. &nbsp;Aside from the vegetables that keep in my cellar 
(onions, squashes, garlic) and the vegetables I have frozen (wild fiddle heads, 
japanese knotweed) lacto-ferments are my main source of &ldquo;living&rdquo; 
vegetation.</p> 
<p>If you have never made a fermentation like this at home, take heart! 
&nbsp;It is easy to do, and requires very little work or know how. &nbsp;Simply 
follow the steps in the video below, and in a couple of weeks you will have 
your first batch ready to eat!</p> 
<p>For those who would like a deeper look into the biological processes that 
take place in the fermentation of cabbage into sauerkraut, check out 
this&nbsp;link!</p> 
<p>I love to hear from you, so please leave me comment below to let me know 
what you think of this post, the website, and what you would like to see next!

<h2>Wild Fermented Hard Cider</h2> 
<p>Did you know that fermented beverages, specifically ethanol containing 
beverages were a crucial componant of most indigenous and traditional health 
strategies? &nbsp;Or that those who drink a moderate amount of ethanol live 
longer than those who drink heavily or don&rsquo;t drink at all?</p> 
<p>Of course the beverages fermented by native peoples and by our traditional 
cultural forebearers were much healthier and nutritionally viable than those of 
today, created with local ingredients and wild yeasts, and were not filtered 
and pasturized like the ones that most of us were raised around. &nbsp;Turning 
simple sugars into ethanol, amino acids, and B complex vitamins, not to mention 
a culturally and ritually significant inebriant is a nearly ubiquitous human 
behavior, and part of what holds the fabric of traditional societies together.
</p> 
<p>Earlier in the year I had the culturally enriching experience of imbibing 
some of the traditional fermented beverages of South America, specificallyChicha
 (from Maize)&nbsp;and Masatao (fromCassava), both traditional ferments of the 
people of Peru. &nbsp;These wonderful drinks were both relatively low in 
alcohol, with probably just a bit less than a modern beer, and loaded with 
nutrition and calories, making them as much a food as a drink. &nbsp;I was 
immediately impressed with the way that these were built into the nutritional 
and spiritual systems of the area. &nbsp;They were not viewed as guilt laden 
pleasures or sources of immoral behavior and debauchery,&nbsp;but rather as 
sacred and vitally health supportive. &nbsp;And while we use the term 
&ldquo;intoxicant&rdquo; to refer to drinks that contain alcohol, these people 
didn&rsquo;t associate their sacred beverages with &ldquo;toxicity&rdquo; at 
all.</p> 
<p>It was my desire to begin wild fermenting a local sugar of low to moderate 
alcohol content that could be drank unfiltered and unpasteruized. &nbsp;I 
wanted to recreate this often undiscussed and overlooked aspect of traditional 
human diets and bring it into my home and my life. While I have also been 
fermenting honey with some success (a beverage called Mead), I wanted to brew 
something with a milder effect (mead has the alcohol content of wine, upwards 
of 16 % or more) that could be done with very little labor or input, just the 
way our ancestors had done it.</p> 
<p>Through this quest I have become enamoured by Cider, which is the proper 
name for the fermented alcoholic draught made from the fresh pressed juice from 
apples. &nbsp;Today we often refer to &ldquo;Hard Cider&rdquo; as the fully 
fermented version, and &ldquo;Cider&rdquo; as the unfermented, unfiltered juice 
of apples, which is a departure from the traditional meaning. &nbsp;Cider is 
usually defined as having an alcohol content of 2 &ndash; 8.5 % or higher, 
though my experience is that it tastes great and is incredibly refreshing even 
during initial fermentation when the alcohol content is negligible like that of
Kombucha.</p> 
<p>You can imagine that prior to the widespread use of refrigeration, areas of 
the world with large apple yields would have had quite a bit of Cider on hand, 
as the juice of fresh apples ferments quite readily. Perhaps you have bought 
fresh apple juice from a local orchard before and had it begin to ferment on 
you!</p> 
<p>The apple juice I have worked with begins to ferment almost immediately 
after it reaches room temperature, and in truth gets better each and every day 
that it sits. &nbsp;The initial fermentation stage is wonderful, as the Cider 
develops its sparkling effervescence. &nbsp;I love drinking it this way 
throughout the day, and like saving the older, dryer, and &ldquo;harder&rdquo; 
Cider for the evenings with dinner and after.</p> 
<p>Fermentation can seem a bit intimidating when you haven&rsquo;t tried it 
before, and that is why I am posting this video. &nbsp;Cider is so easy to 
produce at homea cave man could do it!</p> 
<p>I hope you enjoy this two part &ldquo;Wild Fermented Hard Cider&rdquo; 
video. &nbsp;Please give us your feedback by leaving a comment below!</p> 
<p>~Daniel</p> 
<p>P.S. Your probably wondering what &ldquo;a moderate amount of 
alcohol&rdquo; is. &nbsp;Studies indicate that 1 &ndash; 3 drinks ethanol 
drinks per day seems to extend lifespans! Here is a review from the Journal of 
Clinical Epidemiology showing the effects of alcohol on life span!</p> 
<p>P.P.S. &nbsp;I understand the many detrimental effects that alcoholism and 
alcohol related accidents have had on us as individuals and as a civilization. 
&nbsp;I have personally been witness to it in my own life amongst people that I 
love dearly. &nbsp;This blog is in no way supporting reckless or irreverent use 
of ethanol. &nbsp;Alcohol consumption goes further into antiquity than can be 
accounted for, in other words it is part of the human story. &nbsp;Each one of 
us must determine how we will responsibly relate to it as a substance, and how 
we will steward it with health and safety in mind.<br>

<h2>Wild Ricing in Maine!</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>(The actual video of harvesting wild rice is at the bottom of this blog 
post!)</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I have had the opportuntiy to forage wild foods for a few years now, with 
each season yielding greater and greater amounts of food. &nbsp;No harvest yet 
has supplied me with the amount of food energy that I was able to gather this 
September when I learned the ancient art of &ldquo;Ricing&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Most of the wild plants that I have been learning to use are incredibly 
nutritious (as well as delicious) but a bit low in calories. &nbsp;Many wild 
foraged plants are eaten like vegetables (stinging nettle come to 
mind)&nbsp;but lack the energy density that we get from meats, grains, oils, 
concentrated sugars. &nbsp;This means that as a forager I am still largely 
dependent on my local agricultural system to provide me with calories that I 
need to live out my daily life.</p> 
<p>Wild rice however, is a complex carbohydrate (macro-nutrient), and unlike 
the mono-cropped and refined carbohydrates of the average American diet, is a 
rich whole food grain loaded with vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) as 
well.</p> 
<p>Today, most of the worlds citizens are living with an inverse relationship 
between micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc) and macronutrients (calories). 
&nbsp;We have become overfed and under nourished. Our ancestors ate extremely 
micronutrient dense diets when compared against our own. &nbsp;Their constant 
quest instead was securing the macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein 
calories) that they required for their huge daily energy expenditures.</p> 
<p>Of course today it is nearly the opposite, where most of the (over) 
developed world has calorie rich diet composed of overly processed and refined 
food &ndash; think white sugar, white flour, high fructose corn syrup, etc 
&ndash; that is deeply lacking in micro-nutrition. &nbsp;Most Americans are 
deficient in micronutrients even to the RDA standard (recommended daily 
allowances of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences) which is surprisingly low 
when compared against the nutrient intakes of so called &ldquo;primitive 
peoples&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Now that I am moving away from &ldquo;novelty foraging&rdquo; toward a 
subsistence that includes Wild Foods, I am acutely aware of this nutritional 
crux. &nbsp;There are plenty of micronutrients in the foods that I forage from 
my ecosystem, but most of my actual caloric needs still come from my local farm.
</p> 
<p>That is all changing for me now that I have learned to forage a few key 
items, perhaps the greatest and most important, of which is Wild Rice.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Zizania palustris</em></strong> is an aquatic grain occurring 
widely throughout the Eastern United States (like Maine where I live) and 
Canada. &nbsp;It inhabits the shallow waters of lakes, ponds, and slow moving 
rivers. &nbsp;There is a long and rich historical record of its harvest by 
native peoples of this continent and is to this day still harvested by existing 
native populations of North America, and in particular the Great Lakes region.
</p> 
<p>Though today much of the Wild Rice sold in the market place is cultivated 
in rice paddies, this highly nutritious grain is still available to the forager 
for the price of his or her labor.</p> 
<p>Before trying truly wild rice, I was familiar only with the store bought, 
paddy cultivated wild rice which, though wonderful in flavor and rich in 
nutrition, just simply pales in comparison. &nbsp;Hand harvested, sundried, 
fire parched, foot treaded, and wind winnowed wild rice is so soft and delicate 
in flavor that it simply has to be tasted to be understood. &nbsp;The softness 
is like that of the most perfectly cooked white rice but with all the 
nutritious nutty flavors of a wild intact grain. &nbsp;This is because of a 
curing process used with commercially prepared &ldquo;wild rice&rdquo; that 
causes the grains to become very hard and locks in some of the unpleasantly 
strong flavors.</p> 
<p>In contrast to many wild foraged plants, wild rice requires a more 
considerable amount of know how and equipment to locate, access, harvest, and 
process, so to show this in its entirety is simply outside the scope of a blog 
post. &nbsp;Instead I have prepared this short video to highlight the 
experiences I had ricing this season.</p> 
<p>I am hoping that in the future some of you will have the opportunity to 
come to Maine to learn the art in person.</p> 
<p>What a wonderful feeling to know that this winter I will be eating more of 
my calories from foods that were sustainably harvested from my local landscape.
</p> 
<p>I am grateful to the abundant Earth.</p> 
<p>~Daniel</p> 
<p>PS, check out this podcast I recently did where we discuss the history of 
grains and agriculture, as well as some must have information on making the 
grains you use a safe and healthy food!</p>

<h2>Nettle Root Tincturing and Male Health</h2> 
<p>This video below is part 2 of the&nbsp;Stinging Nettle Root harvesting 
video that I put up a couple of weeks back.</p> 
<p>You can see that video here.</p> 
<p>I put this up to demonstrate how simple it is to produce your own wild 
nettle root tincture for use as an herbal medicine.</p> 
<p>Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica) is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant 
known by many of us for the painful stinging hairs (they are actually called 
&ldquo;trichomes&rdquo;) that inject histamine into our skin like micro 
hypodermic needles.</p> 
<p>Despite this, and even because of it, Nettle has been used as food and 
medicine by many cultures and is an important species for those of us who 
practice foraging, herbalism, or primitive outdoor skills.</p> 
<p>While the aerial parts of the plant (the parts that grow above the ground) 
are most commonly eaten as a pot herb (cooked) or made into infusions (teas), 
it is the roots from which we can extract its potent androgenic substances. 
&nbsp;If you are woman reading this pay close attention. &nbsp;While you may 
not need Nettle root as a medicine for yourself, its highly likely you know a 
man who does. &nbsp;Be sure to read &nbsp;on.</p> 
<p>Nettle root supports male health in a few different ways. &nbsp;There is a 
globulin in human blood calledSex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) which binds 
to testosterone, rendering it unavailable to the our cells. &nbsp;Nettle root 
contains compunds that bind to SHBG taking the place of testosterone and 
thereby keeping free testosterone in the blood.</p> 
<p>More than this, it also prevents the conversion of testosterone into a 
metabolite known as dihydrotestosterone, which has been implicated in benign 
prostate hyperplasia and even male pattern baldness.</p> 
<p>If this wasn&rsquo;t enough, phyto-chemicals in Nettle root further work to 
prevent Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) by stopping the binding of DHT to the 
prostate membrane.</p> 
<p>Since the prostrate is the endocrine gland thats responsible for male 
orgasm, taking care of it for a lifetime is probably a good idea!</p> 
<p>Nettle Root is an herbal ally that seems almost designed to ensure the good 
health of a mans reproductive system into longevity (wives and girlfriends may 
want to take note).</p> 
<p>Making your own Nettle Root tinctures at home can be easy, and only takes 
few minutes.</p> 
<p>I encourage you to give it a try, and to get out into your local ecosystem 
to commune with your landscape. &nbsp;This is truest expression of 
environmentalism I can think of!</p>

<h2>Important New Chaga Foraging Update!!!</h2> 
<p>Welcome Friends, Foodies, and Foragers!</p> 
<p>For the last several years I have talked more about Chaga (Inonotus 
obliquus) than any other wild foraged food or medicine.</p> 
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, Chaga is a fungal&nbsp;sclerotium with 
notable anti-cancer &nbsp;terpines (such as betulinic acid) and immune system 
modulating sugars (called beta glucans). &nbsp;More than any other medicinal 
mushroom, this has been my number one herbal/fungal ally. &nbsp;In fact, for 
much of the year I use it almost daily and have for several years now&hellip;
</p> 
<p>Chaga is normally decocted (boiled in water to produce a broth or tea) for 
about two hours, yielding a very mild vanilla like flavor (it containsvanillin 
as one of its components) which is great to drink on its own, with added cream 
and a sweetener (I like maple syrup) to create a drink much like coffee. 
&nbsp;It is also an excellentblended drink or soup base.</p> 
<p>This video post is about peeling Chaga, which is its traditional 
preparation method in Siberia (it is from their folk medicine that we have 
learned of Chaga). &nbsp;For years I used this fungus without peeling it, which 
yeilded wonderful results, but now that I have included the traditional 
preperation method, it would be difficult to depart from. &nbsp;De-barking 
Chaga yields a far more mild, pleasant tasting, less medicinal and more tonic 
tea.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There are of course wonderful uses for Chaga with its bark on as well, 
particularly as an anti-neoplastic medicine. &nbsp;Still for my daily use this 
is now my preferred method.</p> 
<p>Here is another video from my archive showing how to identify and harvest 
Chaga if you are interested in trying this yourself. &nbsp;If you are looking 
for a premier Chaga extract you can find it at my company,SurThrival.</p> 
<p>Thanks for watching and I can&rsquo;t wait to hear your results!</p>

<h2>Wild Foods and Medicines! Harvesting Nettle Rhizomes</h2> 
<p>Greetings Everyone!</p> 
<p>What an amazing Autumn it has been!</p> 
<p>This has been, by far, my most prolific year of harvesting wild food and 
medicine. &nbsp;While I know it is an ambitious goal, it is my personal desire 
to hunt and gather. &nbsp;Spending time withArthur Haines has propelled my wild 
nutrition path forward in ways I am so grateful for. &nbsp;In this video Arthur 
and I go into the wilds in search of wild stinging nettle roots for our 
personal homemade medicine stashes!</p> 
<p>Now that I am just weeks away from SurThrival&rsquo;s launch of its new 
Pine Pollen extracts, I wanted to share a video that is yet one more piece of 
my natural hormone maintnance strategy.</p> 
<p>I hope this motivates you to get out and harvest some food or medicine for 
yourself. &nbsp;Stay tuned for events that Arthur and I will be putting on 
where you can learn to harvest your own foods and medicines!</p> 
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to check out the mead making workshop that I have 
coming up next week. &nbsp;You can see the detailshere.</p> 
<p>Thanks for watching, and please let me know what you think.</p>

<h2>The Longevity Now Conference!</h2> 
<h2></h2> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2><strong>September 24th-26th, 2010</strong></h2> 
<p>I am honored and excited to share that I will be speaking at the upcoming 
<em>Longevity Now Conference</em>! This health seminar unlike any other. That 
is because this seminar has the worlds leading health authorities, all gathered 
in one place for a whole weekend, to share their unique knowledge around health 
and longevity.<em>The</em> <em>Longevity Now Conference</em> is held at 
the&nbsp;Orange County Hilton in Costa Mesa, CA.<em>The Longevity Now Conference
</em> is by far, the most original, comprehensive,&nbsp;and exhilarating 
healing and longevity seminar&nbsp;I have ever seen.</p> 
<p>Aside from myself speaking, we will be graced with the presence of many 
other amazing health experts such as<em>David Wolfe, Dr. Joseph Mercola, Frank 
Giglio, Donna Gates, Truth Caulkins, Nadine Artemis</em>, and several others! 
Each presenter brings to us their unique skillset and education around optimal 
health and longevity. We are blessed to receive such a wide range of knowledge 
and experience to learn from! I can&rsquo;t wait to see what everyone brings to 
the stage!</p> 
<p>My lecture will revolve around Eugenics and what &ldquo;natural 
foods&rdquo; really are, in this day and age. I recently did an interview with 
Len Foley of the Longevity Now team, in preparation for the event which you can 
listen to<strong><em> here</em></strong>, and get a taste of what I will be 
speaking about at the conference!</p> 
<p>Another aspect that makes this seminar unlike any other, is that each 
individual participant will be &ldquo;grounded&rdquo; (using the latest 
cutting-edge technology provided to us byEarthing) throughout the event in its 
entirety! This is exciting to me, because I am a huge advocate for maximizing 
the amount of time we spend outdoors, with our barefeet connected to the 
ground. However, in this day and age, most of us are unable to spend all of our 
time outdoors ~ That is where the grounding technology comes in. We can use 
these advances to ground us while we are spending time indoors, working away by 
keeping our feet on a ground pad, or wearing one of their grounding bands. In 
addition, each participant will receive a&nbsp;complimentary $40 Earthing Kit 
so that they will experience the healing effects of being&nbsp;grounded even 
while in their hotel room.</p> 
<p>There will be over $10,000 in prizes given&nbsp;out throughout the event as 
well! Truth Caulkins, one of the speakers, brings us a world-class Longevity 
Tonic Bar which will be open all weekend long! The tonic bar team will be 
providing us with the most&nbsp;powerful, delicious healing drinks only 
available through this wonderful crew. The drinks served are scrumptious 
healing blends of herbs and superfoods, to help heal and optimize any 
individuals condition. They are a group of &ldquo;<em>ElixirCraft Masters</em>
&ldquo;, for sure!</p> 
<p>We are also excited to have a booth in the exhibition area for my company, 
<strong><em>SurThrival</em></strong>, all weekend long at the event! The whole 
SurThrival team with be present for the weekend, posted up at the booth, ready 
to share and connect with all of the participants! We will have our full 
product line up for sale at our booth, along with some surprises we are waiting 
to reveal for the first time at the conference! We are can&rsquo;t wait to 
share our latest excitement with all of you there!</p> 
<p>One last piece I would like announce, is that I will be one of the featured 
speakers in the extended workshop taking place the Monday after the conference 
concludes! This workshop is being called &ldquo;The Masters Workshop&rdquo;, 
and it will be a comprehensive lecture between myself, David Wolfe, and Truth 
Caulkins where we will go in depth about ElixirCrafting,&nbsp;the art of &nbsp;
tonic alchemy, the secrets to&nbsp;abundant health, complete cell rejuvenation, 
and longevity. There will also be a 90-minute panel, where the audience members 
can ask us all of their burning question!</p> 
<p>I highly encourage you&nbsp;to join us in September at this event.&nbsp;Not 
only will you discover the latest advances in&nbsp;longevity technology that 
aren&rsquo;t available anywhere&nbsp;else, but this event will be nothing short 
of one of the most&nbsp;uplifting, educational, and inspirational 
weekends&nbsp;of your life.</p> 
<p>Three full days of major downloads of advanced information is priced at a 
mere$297!&nbsp;This is a huge deal considering the amount of knowledge, 
connections, goodies, and community you will leave with after the weekend!</p> 
Click Here to Reserve Your Seat Today! <br>
 Look forward to seeing YOU there 
and making a connection!  Bless,  ~ D
