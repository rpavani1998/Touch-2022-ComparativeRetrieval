<h1>Grow Your Own Food in Small Spaces</h1> 
<p><em>by</em> Sherie Blumenthal | Monday, May 30th, 2011 | From: Home and 
Garden</p> <br>

<p>Spring is in the air &ndash; even if it is very, wet rainy air &ndash; and 
that means its time to get your hands in the dirt and get your vegetable garden 
started. What&rsquo;s that you say? You have no backyard or green space to grow 
your own food? No worries! You can still raise fresh, nutritious, homegrown 
vegetables just about anywhere, as long as you can find yourself some sturdy, 
simple containers. Container gardening is an easy, enjoyable way to grow your 
own vegetables, and can be done on a windowsill, patio, balcony, doorstep, or 
any space that will provide sufficient sunlight and ease of care.</p> 
<p>The best part is, almost any vegetable that will grow in a typical backyard 
garden can also do well in a container. Some vegetables that are well-suited 
for container gardening are tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, bush beans, 
lettuce, spinach, summer squash, radishes, and herbs. Other vegetables that can 
do well in containers if the conditions are right are cabbage, kale, broccoli 
and cauliflower.</p> 
<p>When making the decision to container garden, you will want to think about 
many of the same things you&rsquo;d be thinking about if you were gardening on 
a piece of land, such as healthy soil, adequate sunlight, enough water, good 
fertilizer, and thoughtful pest management. Of course, when container 
gardening, you will also have to think about what types of containers you will 
grow your vegetables in.</p> 
<p>Almost any type of container can be used for growing vegetables. You can 
choose simple containers like buckets, baskets, tubs, or wooden boxes, or you 
can get creative and plant in shoes, recycled sinks and bathtubs, or even a 
kiddie pool. Whatever container you choose, you will want to make sure you 
match the type of plant you grow to the size of the container. (Big plant? 
Think big pot!)</p> 
<p>For vegetables such as summer squash, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant, you 
will find that five-gallon buckets, or something similar in size, are the best 
fit. For vegetables like Swiss chard, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, one 
to two gallon containers work better. Smaller containers &ndash; about 4-6 
inches deep &ndash; can be used to grow vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and 
herbs.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to be careful about the material your container is 
made of. Containers are either porous or nonporous. Plastic, glazed ceramic, 
and dark glass containers are nonporous and hold water better. Wood, unglazed 
ceramic (like terracotta), or papier mache pots are all porous and lose 
moisture more quickly. You can plant in either porous or nonporous containers, 
but you will need to adjust how much, and how frequently, you water your 
plants, and pay special attention to drainage. To aid in good drainage flow, 
make sure any container you use has several drain holes along the bottom edge.
</p> 
<p>After you&rsquo;ve chosen containers appropriate to the vegetables you plan 
to grow, and placed your containers in the warmest sunniest spot you can find, 
you will need to choose a suitable growing medium. A good growing medium will 
hold water and provide adequate nutrients and physical support to grow healthy 
plants. A good growing medium must also drain well, otherwise your plants could 
end up in a puddle and drown! A standard potting soil that you find in your 
garden store should work just fine. You can add some organic compost to your 
soil mix for heavy feeders like tomatoes and peppers. A good estimate is to 
fill your container with 2/3 potting soil to 1/3 organic compost.</p> 
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your containers filled with healthy soil, you can 
either direct seed or transplant healthy, strong, seedlings into your 
containers. What comes next is the usual care and attention you would pay to 
any of your plants &ndash; regular watering, feeding and some good old 
fashioned TLC.</p> 
<p><strong>Troubleshooting for Container Gardening</strong><br>
 Be mindful of 
over watering. Make sure your soil is like a damp sponge. Once your plant is 
fully grown, it is OK to let it go a few days without watering. Be careful that 
plants in porous containers, like ceramic pots, don&rsquo;t dry out too much, 
though. Wrapping a moist towel around the pot sometimes helps. Watch for poor 
drainage due to inadequate drain holes or compacted soil. It&rsquo;s never too 
late to drill more holes. Finally, keep an eye out to make sure your plants 
aren&rsquo;t outgrowing their pots. This is a sure sign that the pot may have 
been too small to begin with, which is why choosing the right container is so 
important.</p> 
<p>Just like any other kind of gardening, container gardening is an adventure, 
with lots of unexpected twists and turns not always predicted on your road map. 
However, you can be successful at container gardening if you are attentive and 
observant. Most of all, don&rsquo;t forget to take time to enjoy the fruits of 
your labor!</p> 
<p>Until next time, keep growin&rsquo;!</p>  Sherie Blumenthall is a Food

<p>Hello all. Thanks for the post on container gardening. Our soil here is not 
suitable for gardens so this is something to consider. I would like to put out 
a few things so we can have something of a garden this year. I will give this a 
try.</p> </dd>

<p>I was hoping for some advice. I planted radishes in a container garden, 
spaced properly and kept moist but I&rsquo;m getting just leaves About 10 
inches tall but no bulbs. Can anyone tell me what I&rsquo;m doing wrong? Thanks.

<p>Container gardening is the only way to go for me. My home soil is 
unworkable. </p> 
<p>I caution all &ldquo;newbies&rdquo; to container gardening to know the 
history of their containers. Never use containers that have housed chemicals, 
or that are painted with lead-based paint (as these leach into the container, 
and can leach into your veggies). If you don&rsquo;t know what kind of paint 
it&rsquo;s painted with, or what it was used to contain before, don&rsquo;t use 
it for growing your food.</p> </dd>

<p>Hi, I love to use old styrafoam ice chests ( just the cheap ones) to plant 
in. Just punch a few holes in the bottom, fill with potting soil and plant. The 
beauty is , they are light, hold water, and keep the plants&rsquo; roots cool. 
Although they are not pretty to look at, you could spray paint them, or set 
them in another more decorative container.</p> </dd>

<p>I have two in-ground garden beds, but can&rsquo;t resist having my 
container garden every year. I can and do grow about anything in containers on 
my front deck, where they get plenty of sun. Sometimes I include flowers, but 
mostly I focus on veggies. I grow all my herbs in containers, and this year, I 
grew rutabagas and kohlrabi in containers. I have to say, I hadn&rsquo;t tried 
collards in containers yet, but I will this fall! Great idea! Sherrye, it 
definitely is a learning experience, and a great challenge at times to grow a 
container garden. Have you tried a bowl of French Breakfast radishes? It 
won&rsquo;t be long before I can&rsquo;t do in-ground gardening any more, but I 
won&rsquo;t give up container gardening until they pry the trowel from my cold 
dead hand! LoL!</p> </dd>

<p>Styrofoam peanuts added to the bottom of the container make good drainage 
material. You can try growing collards, one to a pot, for cut- and- come- again 
greens taken from the bottom of the rosette. The plant will live two or three 
years and develop a long stalk, and at least until it develops the telltale 
yellow flowers, will, when taken inside for winter, be mistaken for a Dracaena.

<p>We are container gardening for the first time this year. I have always been 
good at growing things in the earth, but never in containers, so I&rsquo;ve 
shied away from that. Age and health issues dictated simplifying our gardening, 
and it has been an &ldquo;adventure&rdquo;. Because of cost, we opted for 
plastic containers (and homemade wooden ones). I almost drowned several plants 
before we realized that they were &ldquo;floating&rdquo;. Back to the drawing 
board!! We drilled more holes and added rock on the bottom. I had put pine bark 
mulch on top, so it wasn&rsquo;t evident. We did manage to save them in time, 
and so far I&rsquo;ve had peas (too hot now). The beans, tomatoes, cukes, 
peppers and onions are coming along. I also added a lot of perennials and 
annuals for color&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;everything is on the deck. It had been 
a challenge and we&rsquo;ve learned several things that will help us do a 
better job next year.</p> </dd> </dl>

<p>If you notice a hole in the upper left-hand corner of your Farmers' 
Almanac, don't return it to the store! That hole isn't a defect; it's a part of 
history. Starting with the first edition of the Farmers' Almanac in 1818, 
readers used to nail holes into the corners to hang it up in their homes, 
barns, and outhouses (to provide both reading material and toilet paper). In 
1910, the Almanac's publishers began pre-drilling holes in the corners to make 
it even easier for readers to keep all of that invaluable information (and 
paper) handy.</p> <br>
