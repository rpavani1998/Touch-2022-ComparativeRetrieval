<h2> Think You Can Live Without Plastic? </h2> 
<p>One writer chronicles the ubiquity of plastic products in daily life. </p>

<p>How do I love thee, plastic? Let me count the ways. I wake up and glance at 
my plastic digital cable box to check the time. I go to the bathroom to use my 
plastic toothbrush, shaking a bit of my &ldquo;nontoxic&rdquo; tooth powder 
from a plastic bottle. I fill the plastic container of my Waterpik with 
mouthwash from another plastic bottle. I step into the shower&mdash;my lacy 
white curtain is protected by a plastic liner, and my chlorine-free shower 
water comes to me through a plastic-encased filter.<br>

<p>Ah, but in the kitchen I am a bit freer of you, plastic. When I learned 
that my plastic bowls, dishes, and containers could leach harmful 
chemicals&mdash;especially the ones with that sneaky, practically invisible 
little recycling triangleembossed with the number 7&mdash;I bought Pyrex. My 
soft-boiled eggs are served up in a Pyrex glass dish. A moment of rebellion 
against thee, plastic! But the microwave in which I heat water for tea is made 
of plastic as well as metal. And the refrigerator shelf on which I store my 
eggs is plastic.<br>
</p> 
<p>The coaster on my desk, on which I place my steaming, oh-so-healthy green 
tea, is plastic. The 22-inch liquid-crystal computer monitor that seems to be 
the fulcrum of my entire existence is made of plastic. My keyboard, my mouse, 
my computer speakers, the CD cases for my music collection, my polycarbonate 
reading glasses, the remote control for my stereo, my telephone&mdash;all 
plastic. The sun shines through my window onto a riot of green plants in 
&hellip; plastic pots. (I could switch to ceramic, but it&rsquo;s so heavy and 
hard to heft when I want to water them.) And I&rsquo;ve been up for only an 
hour.<br>

<br>  Humans have a perplexing &#8232;tendency to fear rare threats such as 
shark attacks while blithely &#8232;ignoring far greater risks like 
&#8232;unsafe sex and an unhealthy diet. Those illusions are not just 
&#8232;silly&mdash;they make the world a more dangerous place.&#8233; October
