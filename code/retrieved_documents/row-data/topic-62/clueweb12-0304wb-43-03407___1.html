<p>Where do you start when training the perfect Barista? Possibly the first 
step is to acknowledge that there is no such thing as 'perfect', but a high 
level of skill and ability can be achieved through practise, knowledge and 
commitment. Before training can be considered it is neccesary to choose the 
staff who will operate your equipment carefully, they must be self motivated, 
friendly and commited to making great drinks all of the time. The biggest 
failure in the UK speciality coffee market at present is not due to the 
equipment used, not even the coffee in the grinder (although good coffee does 
help a great deal). Instead the fault lies with disintrested staff who have had 
little or no real training, making them even more disintrested. To make a great 
Cappuccino you need to want it to be great, if you are not bothered then the 
drinks produced will be inconsistent and lack the quality your customers 
demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can't choose your staff for you, but we can help motivate them to make 
fantastic drinks for you. This is why Pennine training staff not only have 
certificates from Lavazza UK's training centre to show they have undergone 
comprehensive training in the fine art of making espresso and cappuccino, but 
they have years of experience from supplying and installing espresso machines 
which has fine tuned these skills. Now our customers receive comprehensive 
guidance on setting up their equipment, maintaining it to keep drinks 
consistent and staff training for espresso, cappuccino's, artistic lattes, 
decadent mochas and fantastic flavoured drinks (ie cinnamon roll latte!)</p>

<p>Equipment </p> 
<p>The most important part of your speciality coffee setup, but worth very 
little if it is not set up correctly. It is a common misconception that to make 
the best drinks the most expensive or best known brand of espresso machine 
needs to be purchased, this is false because even the best equipment money can 
buy will not produce a quality espresso if it has not been set up correctly - 
before staff training is even considered. So how should you set up your 
espresso equipment?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>The grinder </b>- Grind setting is fundamentaly important, too coarse 
and your espresso will underextract rushing into the cup in a great deal less 
then the correct time of between 20 and 25 seconds per 1 floz. Your exact 
extraction time will depend on the coffee bean blend used, it's proportion of 
Arabica to Robusta and the component bean origins. Too fine a grind and 
overextraction will occur, the tightly packed fine coffee grains make it hard 
for the water to pass through the coffee, your espresso will drip into the cup 
and take over a minute! Even if you don't time the extraction it is easy to 
spot a bad espresso - by looking at the'crema' (creamy golden brown head that 
should be on every espresso). A thin or non-existant crema indicates a too 
coarse grind and far too quick extraction, a very dark crema indicates too fine 
a grind causing a slow extraction. Ideally you should have a creamy brown crema 
which clings to the side of the &nbsp;cup lazily during drinking. It should 
hold a teaspoon of sugar on top for a short while as well.</p>
<p>However the quality of crema is influenced by the quality of espresso 
coffee bean - so don't expect miracles if you use cheap beans! Indeed the 
extraction time given above varies so much - from 20 to 25 seconds per 1 floz, 
because your optimum extraction depends on the espresso blend you use and it's 
Arabica to Robusta component ratio. You must find the optimum extraction using 
your own taste skills, the &quot;crema&quot; quality (it should be light to 
medium brown, dark brown and speckled indicates an overextraction) and what 
your own experience says is right. Remember as you try to find your optimum, 
one notch adjustment to finer or coarser on your grinder will change your 
extraction by 5 seconds slower or faster respectively.</p>
<p>The doser of your grinder should be set up to dispense between 7 and 7.5 
grams of ground coffee per lever pull. The other very important part of your 
grinder is your grinding disks, which may need&nbsp;replacing if you start 
to&nbsp;find even your fine grind seems coarse or&nbsp;unevenly ground.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Routine care of grinders involves cleaning the bean hopper regularly with a 
soft cloft, and using a soft bristled brush to clean the inside of the ground 
coffee chamber. After opening your kilo of coffee beans, only put enough in 
your hopper to last you a few hours (if you don't get really busy!), then fold 
the bag down concertina fashion and keep sealed down with tape or an elastic 
band.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p><b>The espresso machine</b> - Essential to your operation, a big investment 
for any business, yet still so often abused when just a little care would make 
all the difference. Just try and remember how many times you have seen an 
espresso machine with steam arms caked in caramelised milk and stained filter 
holders which leak coffee from around the group as well as the spout. Did it 
put you in the mood for a cappuccino?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Filter pans (left) stain quickly, seperate nightly from the filter holder 
and soak in water. Once a week seperate from the filter holders and soak in an 
espresso cleaner. Oil build up (near left) will taint the flavour of your drink.
</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Filter holders are far too commonly found in the far right state, and if 
you never bother to seperate the pans from the holder you may never notice how 
bad they look. Compare the regularly cleaned holder near right, the dark build 
up visible is caused by oils and tannins extracted from the coffee. A build up 
like this will taint the taste and quality of the espresso produced. Maybe that 
few minutes each night is worth it!</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Soaking holders like this is all it takes to keep them clean and your 
drinks as their best. Note that when you use cleaning solution the plastic 
handles should be kept above the waterline to stop damage to the plastic.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>You will never see the diffusers pictured right because they reside in the 
group of your espresso machine. However, backflush with the blank filter plate 
every night and the build up seen near right will be reduced consderabley. To 
backflush you need to remove a filter pan from any filter handle, insert the 
blank plate (no holes!) and then replace the filter holder into the group. Run 
the group for around 14 seconds then switch off. Remove the holder and you will 
see ground coffee in the blank plate, this has been flushed off the diffusers. 
Repeat this process three times, or until no more grinds appear in the blank 
plate.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Gaskets hide in the group head as well, and although you may not see them 
they are prone to wear. To reduce this we reccomend you wipe the top of your 
filter holder after tamping the coffee in it to remove stray grinds. Near left 
is a new diffuser, compare with the heat shrunken holders on the far left. You 
can just make out the burnt in line as well, stray grinds on the filter holder 
burn into the gasket reducing it's sealing properties. A worn gasket will let 
coffee leak from the top of the filter holder when espresso is being extracted.

<p><b>Steam Arms</b> - Cleaning steam arms is essential to make good 
cappuccino, a build up of caramalised milk on your espresso machine steam arms 
looks very bad to your customers and it will impair the steaming and foaming 
ability of your machine. Wipe the steam arm with a damp cloth after foaming 
milk, and each night soak it in a cup of water to help remove any stubborn 
build up. Cleaning with an abrasive pad will damage the steam arm leaving it 
discoloured.</p>
<p>So now you have your machine clean and well maintained, what are the 
factors that will make your perfect espresso?</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>7 grams of good espresso ground coffee.</b> </p></li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Tamped at around 50 psi (ideally but not essential)</b> </p></li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Brewed with water at between 190 to 192 degrees fareinheit (90 degrees 
celcius)</b> </p></li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Pressure developed in the group by the pump to 9 bar (130 psi)</b> </p>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Extracted at 20 to 25&nbsp;seconds per 1 floz.</b> </p></li> </ul> 
<p> </p>
<p>For cappuccino your milk should be steamed in a stainless steel frothing 
jug, with the milk held at a slight angle and the steam wand jets held just 
under the milks surface. As the foam develops, lower the foaming jug so the 
steam jets remain just below the surface of the foam. If you are measuring 
temperature by hand stop steaming when you can no longer hold the side of your 
foaming container. If you use a thermometer stop steaming at 150 degrees 
fareinheit for cappuccino, or 160 degrees fareinheit for latte. Over 180 
degrees fareinheit will burn the milk making it useless. If you obtain 
sufficient foam prior to these temperatures, lower the steam wand to the base 
of the milk container to complete steaming.</p>
<p>Wipe your steam arm after steaming to stop a caramalised build up. This 
will not only look a lot better for your customers, but will also help prevent 
health issues (bacteria will also build up with the old milk, and could result 
in Diahorrea for your customers).</p> <br>
