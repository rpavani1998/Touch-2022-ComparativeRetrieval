<li> Resolutions Aren't Just for January &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 1 
of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>Resolutions Aren't Just for January</h2> 
<p>In fact, some -- like resolving to be a truly eco-conscious eater -- are 
best undertaken during the summer, when fresh food is everywhere. There are a 
ton of little things you can do that have a huge impact: turning on the oven 
less often, making delicious use of every last part of a pasture-raised 
chicken, stocking up on seasonal berries for winter. And, of course, there's 
the power you wield with your grocery cart.<br>
<br>
 &quot;If 40 percent of 
American households bought only organic milk, it would change dairy 
production,&quot; says Michel Nischan, co-owner of the Dressing Room restaurant 
in Westport, Connecticut, and author of&quot;Sustainably Delicious.&quot; 
&quot;You really can be a hero one product at a time.&quot;<br>
<br>
 What 
follows are fresh ways to shop, cook, and eat heroically, now and all year 
round.</p> </li> 
<li> 1. Use the Whole Vegetable &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 2 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>1. Use the Whole Vegetable</h2>  The stems of cauliflower or broccoli, the 
inner leaves of celery, the fronds of fennel, the greens of beets, even the 
stems of herbs: all edible, all tasty. </li> 
<li> 2. Get to the Root &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 3 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>2. Get to the Root</h2>  Forgo bagged and boxed salad greens for loose 
bunches, and look for anything with the roots attached. You'll use zero 
packaging, and you can compost -- or maybe even eat -- the stems. </li> 
<li> 3-7. Be a Farmers' Market Regular &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 4 
of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>3-7. Be a Farmers' Market Regular</h2>  Your purchases will directly 
support local agriculture. There are now more than 5,200 farmers' markets in 
the country (find one near you atlocalharvest.org), and the numbers will 
continue to grow if we make them our personal Stop &amp; Shops.<br>
<br>
<b>Get 
staples.</b> Instead of only a handful of tomatoes, pick up onions, potatoes, 
and herbs.<br>
<br>
<b>Buy heirloom.</b> It's not just a boutique marketing 
term. It describes vegetables, fruits, grains, and beans from seeds that have 
been passed down for generations, grown in small crops that may restore the 
health of the soil.<br>
<br>
<b>Stock up.</b> Buy in bulk when produce is in 
season. Freeze it, pickle it , or preserve it, so you can still eat local when 
you have off-season cravings.<br>
<br>
<b>Get advice.</b> Ask the farmers for 
recipe suggestions.<br>
<br>
<b>Challenge yourself.</b> Try to use only what's 
at the market for a week's worth of meals. </li> 
<li> 8. Buy Organic &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 5 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>8. Buy Organic</h2>  &quot;Local is always the priority, but the organic 
label really does mean something,&quot; says chef and author Alice Waters. 
&quot;If you can't buy local, buy organic -- coffees, teas, jams, olive oils, 
honey, nuts, raisins, oatmeal, beans, grains. There's so much available across 
the country now.&quot; 
<p>Learn More About Organics</p> </li> 
<li> 9. Buy Local Eggs &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 6 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>9. Buy Local Eggs</h2>  Purchase them at a farmers' market, directly from 
the person who collected them. Keep in mind a cage-free label in the grocery 
store doesn't necessarily mean the eggs came from chickens that were running 
around a yard -- they still could have been raised indoors.

<li> 10. Use Your Basement the Old-Fashioned Way &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 7 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>10. Use Your Basement the Old-Fashioned Way</h2>  Hardy root vegetables 
like squash, sweet potatoes, beets, turnips, and rutabagas will keep four to 
six months in a chilly cellar where the temperature stays 40 degrees or below. 
Store them as close to the time they were harvested as possible -- preferably 
unwashed, green tops still attached, and packed in sawdust or moist peat moss. 
</li> 
<li> 11. Get Farm-Fresh Food Delivered &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 8 
of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>11. Get Farm-Fresh Food Delivered</h2> 
<p>Find a community-supported agriculture (CSA) farm near you at 
eatwellguide.org or localharvest.org and pay a subscription fee for regular 
batches of local produce (and, in some places, grass-fed meat). If you're 
worried about being able to use it all up, go in on it with a friend or two.</p>
<p>Read More About the CSA Movement</p> </li> 
<li> 12. Be Package Conscious &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 9 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>12. Be Package Conscious</h2>  &quot;If you're buying food at the store, 
try to choose products that come in the least amount of packaging possible, or 
in containers that are easily recyclable in your area,&quot; suggests Alexandra 
Zissu, author of&quot;The Conscious Kitchen.&quot; <br>
</li> 
<li> 13. Google Your Milk &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 10 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>13. Google Your Milk</h2> 
<p>Until the USDA revised the standards last year, 30 to 40 percent of the 
milk sold in the U.S. that was labeled organic was actually from factory 
farm-raised cows. Regulations are tighter now, but not all organic milks are 
created equal. Check your brand atsustainabletable.org -- and opt for 
antibiotic- and rBGH-free (no artificial bovine growth hormones).</p> </li> 
<li> 14. Use Unprocessed Grains &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 11 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>14. Use Unprocessed Grains</h2> 
<p>Anything that qualifies as a whole (i.e., unrefined) grain -- brown rice, 
barley, farro, quinoa -- is automatically healthier for you and the environment 
than a processed grain like white rice. Even better is buckwheat, which can 
improve soil quality.</p> 
<p>Get Healthy Grain Recipes</p> </li> 
<li> 15. Soak Beans and Grains Overnight &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 12
 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>15. Soak Beans and Grains Overnight</h2>  You'll cut the cooking time -- 
and energy usage -- in half. </li> 
<li> 16. Read Those Labels Photo: JOHNNY MILLER &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>

&lt; 13 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>16. Read Those Labels</h2> 
<p>&quot;My criteria for choosing packaged foods are: nothing with more than 
five ingredients, no ingredients I can't pronounce, nothing artificial, and no 
cartoons on the package,&quot; says Marion Nestle, nutritionist, author of
&quot;What to Eat&quot; and creator of Foodpolitics.com.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Why no cartoons? Because those companies are deliberately marketing 
to children, and I want to discourage that.&quot;</p> </li> 
<li> 17. Freeze Berries &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 14 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>17. Freeze Berries</h2>  They top the list of foods to buy organic because 
of typically high pesticide levels. Stock up when they're available locally, 
spread them on a cookie sheet, and freeze them for six to eight hours. Then 
transfer to storage bags or containers. They're great for making smoothies, 
desserts, or just for snacking, even when summer's only a distant memory. </li> 
<li> 18. Make Your Own Seltzer &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 15 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>18. Make Your Own Seltzer</h2>  Carbonation machines keep bottles out of 
the landfill. Mix seltzer with a fresh fruit syrup to make fizzy drinks. (Heat 
1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup water until sugar dissolves. Add 1/2 cup raspberries, 
remove from heat, let steep for 30 minutes, then strain. Add to seltzer.) </li> 
<li> 19. Buy Local Bread &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 16 of 40 &gt; <br>
<h2>19. Buy Local Bread</h2>  Shop at your neighborhood bakery or farmers' 
market. You'll eliminate a plastic package and a fuel-burning journey, and the 
bread's likelier to be made with fewer ingredients. </li> 
<li> 20. Make Breadcrumbs &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 17 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>20. Make Breadcrumbs</h2>  Whiz stale bread into crumbs and freeze. Or 
dice and toss with olive oil, season, and toast to make croutons. </li> 
<li> 21. Read Plu Codes &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 18 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>21. Read Plu Codes</h2>  If the number on the produce sticker at the 
supermarket starts with 9, then the item is organic. </li> 
<li> 22. Make Connections &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 19 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>22. Make Connections</h2>  &quot;Become friends with your local growers 
and fishermen, so you can keep in touch about what's just been picked or 
caught,&quot; suggests Martha Stewart, founder of Whole Living's parent company.
</li> 
<li> 23. Cut Out Processed Corn &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 20 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>23. Cut Out Processed Corn</h2> 
<p>Avoid buying items with corn or corn-based substances (corn oil, 
cornstarch, or corn syrup) as ingredients. According to the USDA, at least 85 
percent of the corn grown in this country has been genetically modified, 
meaning the plants were altered to make them more pest resistant. The Food 
Alliance Certified seal, at left, means that a product has not been genetically 
modified.&nbsp;</p>

<li> 24. ... And Eat More Real Corn &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 21 of 
40 &gt; <br>

<h2>24. ... And Eat More Real Corn</h2> 
<p>Fresh corn is easy to stockpile. Blanch the cobs, strip the kernels -- 
OXO's Corn Peeler works as effortlessly as a potato peeler -- and freeze.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 25. Wash Less Wastefully &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 22 of 40 &gt;
<br> 
<h2>25. Wash Less Wastefully</h2>  Instead of running greens under the faucet 
for minutes at a time, submerge them in water, drain, and roll in a cloth 
towel. Rinse only if they're still gritty. </li> 
<li> 26. Save That Cooking Water &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 23 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>26. Save That Cooking Water</h2>  Repurpose the nutrient-rich water you 
used to blanch a batch of vegetables for soups or for boiling pasta. (Or water 
plants with it if unsalted and oil-free.) </li> 
<li> 27-30. Eat Safer Seafood &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 24 of 40 &gt;
<br> 
<h2>27-30. Eat Safer Seafood</h2>  You can enjoy the varieties below with a 
clean conscience, says Barry Estabrook, writer and founder of
Politicsoftheplate.com. For on-the-spot ratings, text the Blue Ocean 
Institute's FishPhone -- 30644 -- with the message &quot;fish&quot; and the 
kind you're planning to buy.<br>
<br>
<b>Wild Alaskan salmon, Alaskan halibut, 
or just about any fish from Alaska:</b> &quot;The state has some of the most 
environmentally sound fishing practices in the country.&quot;<br>
<br>
<b>
Anything in a shell:</b> &quot;Mussels, clams, and oysters are almost always 
sustainably raised.&quot;<br>
<br>
<b>Wild American shrimp:</b> &quot;The tiny 
ones from Maine, pink shrimp from the northwest, and wild-caught from the 
Atlantic.&quot;<br>
<br>
<b>Local varieties:</b> &quot;Dungeness crabs from the 
Northwest, line-caught striped bass and haddock from the Northeast, and so 
on.&quot; </li> 
<li> 31. Buy Better Canned Tuna &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 25 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>31. Buy Better Canned Tuna</h2>  American albacore is the only canned 
variety out there that's certified to be sustainably fished. Wild Planet's 
albacore is hand-packed in BPA-free cans without added oil, water, or fillers. 
From $4 a can;wildplanetfoods.com <br>
</li> 
<li> 32. Make Stock &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 26 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>32. Make Stock</h2> 
<p>Once you've used up the last of a chicken or a turkey, throw the carcass in 
a stockpot with enough water to cover, a whole or half onion, a carrot, a 
celery stalk, a few garlic cloves, and a couple of sprigs of herbs like parsley 
and thyme. Simmer (uncovered) for at least two hours, occasionally skimming the 
foam that forms at the top. Strain it, pour into glass jars (leaving room for 
the liquid to expand), let cool, and then freeze.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You'll have four or five quarts of ready-made stock on hand for soup, 
braised meat and vegetables, pan sauces, pasta, and risotto. You can use this 
method for vegetable stock too. Start a collection of unused vegetables -- an 
onion quarter, carrot greens, a turnip, wilted herbs -- and simmer them in 
water for at least an hour.</p> </li> 
<li> 33. Buy Whole Chickens &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 27 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>33. Buy Whole Chickens</h2>  You'll get more meat -- and rich stock -- for 
your money and far less waste. Look for chickens without hormones that were 
pasture raised. And they couldn't be easier to roast: Brush with butter and 
season with salt and pepper; bind legs with twine. Roast at 450 degrees, 
basting occasionally, for about an hour. </li> 
<li> 34. Fill Up the Oven &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 28 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>34. Fill Up the Oven</h2>  As you're roasting a chicken or baking a 
lasagna, throw in some vegetables or tomatoes for roasting, and maybe a loaf or 
two of zucchini bread. The goal is to turn the oven on just once or twice a 
week. </li> 
<li> 35. Pick Healthier Pots and Pans &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 29 
of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>35. Pick Healthier Pots and Pans</h2>  It really is best to skip 
traditional nonstick pans with carcinogenic chemicals (PTFE and PFOA) in the 
coating altogether. There are alternatives -- like Cuisinart'sGreenGourmet 
line, which has a nonstick interior that's ceramic rather than petroleum-based. 
Or keep it simple and cook with pots and pans made from stainless steel, pure 
cast iron, or enamel-coated cast iron.<br>
</li> 
<li> 36. Have a Green BBQ &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 30 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>36. Have a Green BBQ</h2>  Use carbon-neutral  Green Hearts Natural 
Charcoal Briquettes made of wood. <br>
</li> 
<li> 37-39. Be a Smarter Carnivore &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 31 of 40
&gt; <br>

<h2>37-39. Be a Smarter Carnivore</h2>  Though rancher Bill Niman says the 
first step toward a sustainable food system is to eat less meat overall, there 
are easy ways to be a better meat eater:<br>
<br>
<b>Skip the additives.</b> 
Buy only absolutely antibiotic- and hormone-free meat.<br>
<br>
<b>Choose 
domestic meat.</b> You can imagine how eating lamb from New Zealand might 
affect your carbon footprint.<br>
<br>
<b>Eat it seasonally.</b> There's a 
reason we have turkey at Thanksgiving -- the birds mature in the fall. Look for 
lamb in spring and goose around Christmas. </li> 
<li> 40. Plant More Than Flowers &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 32 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>40. Plant More Than Flowers</h2>  &quot;Almost anybody can grow just a 
little bit of food,&quot; says chef, farmer, and activist Michel Nischan. 
&quot;You don't have to be an expert gardener.&quot; </li> 
<li> 41. Pour on the Honey &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 33 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>41. Pour on the Honey</h2>  &quot;A huge amount of water is required to 
produce regular table sugar,&quot; says Louisa Shafia, author of&quot;Lucid 
Food.&quot; &quot;Honey, on the other hand, is a perfectly renewable resource 
that requires little more than healthy bees and healthy plants and flowers from 
which to pollinate. Try adapting your favorite recipe to use honey instead of 
dry sugar.&quot;<br>
</li> 
<li> 42. Compost Your Kitchen Waste &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 34 of 
40 &gt; <br>

<h2>42. Compost Your Kitchen Waste</h2>  Not just vegetable scraps and 
eggshells, but leftovers, coffee grounds, stale bread, tea bags, and pretty 
much anything else (though animal fats, scraps, and bones don't break down 
easily and can attract pests). If you can't use it all, give excess back to 
local farmers or to a community garden. 
<p>Get Composting Tips from MarthaStewart.com</p> </li> 
<li> 43. Limit Yourself to Two Appliances. Then Use Them. &lt;&lt;&lt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 35 of 40 &gt; <br>

<h2>43. Limit Yourself to Two Appliances. Then Use Them.</h2>  Plugging in a 
high-speed blender or a food processor is worthwhile if it motivates you to 
cook more often and eat more fruits and vegetables. You can get a couple of 
meals out of a seasonal soup and several out of a homemade pesto. </li> 
<li> 44. Drink Better Coffee &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 36 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>44. Drink Better Coffee</h2>  Your watchwords are &quot;fair-trade 
certified&quot; and &quot;sustainable.&quot; Also look for 
&quot;bird-friendly&quot; or the Rainforest Alliance label, which means the 
beans were grown responsibly. Brew it at home with a French press (2 
tablespoons coarsely ground coffee per 6 ounces water) and you've started the 
day on a very green foot. </li> 
<li> 45. Switch to Organic Olive Oil &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 37 of 
40 &gt; <br>

<h2>45. Switch to Organic Olive Oil</h2>  Most mass-produced olive oil is 
grown with pesticides, which can be even more concentrated in the oil than on 
the olives. Budget for domestic (likely California), small-producer olive oil 
labeled organic. </li> 
<li> 46. Make Your Own Vinaigrette &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 38 of 40
&gt; <br>

<h2>46. Make Your Own Vinaigrette</h2>  Salad dressing is a packaged condiment 
that's so much better homemade -- and it's incredibly easy to whip up. Mix 1 
minced shallot, 3 tablespoons any good vinegar, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, 1/2 
cup olive oil, and salt and pepper. It'll keep for a week in a corked glass 
bottle in the fridge. </li> 
<li> 47. Use Natural Waxed Paper &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 39 of 40 
&gt; <br>

<h2>47. Use Natural Waxed Paper</h2>  Brands like If You Care produce 
unbleached paper lined with vegetable wax. Use it instead of aluminum foil or 
plastic wrap. It's compostable, reusable when wiped down, and can be fastened 
with masking tape.<br>
</li> 
<li> 48-50. Go Plastic-Free &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&lt; 40 of 40 &gt; 
<br> 
<h2>48-50. Go Plastic-Free</h2> 
<p>Keeping track of which plastics are safer (Nos. 2, 4, 5) and which are more 
likely to release toxic phthalates, styrene, or BPA when heated or warm (Nos. 
3, 6, 7) can be confusing. (We have yet to come up with an easy-to-remember 
shorthand.) So make it a policy to use as little as possible in the kitchen. A 
few ideas:<br>
<br>
<b>Get Glass Containers...</b> Airtight plastic bags are 
okay, but theGlasslock containers shown at left are freezable and microwavable.
<br> <br>
<b>...And glass bottles and jars.</b> Store liquids like juice, oil, 
and vinegar, or bulk-bought grains, beans, and nuts.<br>
<br>
<b>Wrap with dish 
towels.</b> Surround baked goods with cloth instead of plastic wrap. You can 
also use a towel and rubber band to cover bowls of food to chill in the fridge 
before serving.</p> </li> 
<li> Start Over &lt;  &mdash; &gt; <br>
