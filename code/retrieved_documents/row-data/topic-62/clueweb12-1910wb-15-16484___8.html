July 28, 2011 - 12:05am  Cooking with gas: It's a blast! <br>

<p>&quot;Now you're cooking with gas.&quot; That was a popular phrase used by 
the cool cats back in the day. For the past several years, I've been cooking 
with gas at home and I love it.</p> 
<p>In 2007, we remodeled our kitchen. The project started when we investigated 
installing a better exhaust fan, and as most things go in my house, before I 
knew it Judy had an entire kitchen remodel under way. I laugh about it now, but 
I can hardly remember cooking without my gas oven top.</p> 
<p>While I love gas, it scares me to death.</p> 
<p>I'll be comfy in bed, as cozy as I will be all night and I'll have to get 
out from under the covers to check one more time that I turned off the gas 
burners. I'll return to bed with a relieved mind, but my back never returns to 
that perfect position.</p> 
<p>Part of this comes from my Western New York/Pennsylvania upbringing. During 
college, I lived with my grandmother in an aged house that lacked proper 
insulation. Besides the old furnace in the basement, we had smaller gas stoves 
in the other rooms, especially in the upstairs apartment where I lived. When 
the winter winds blew hard and in the right direction, it would blow out the 
flames from some of jets, leaving them exposed to ooze unignited natural gas 
into the apartment's entryway. And people wonder why I am a light sleeper.</p> 
<p>While I'm not crazy about heating with gas, I've actually cooked on it many 
times in my life. I learned to make my Uncle Don's wonderful scrambled eggs on 
his gas stove. My first bit of adolescent responsibility was when he showed me 
at a young age how to light the burners with a match. His old gas stove top 
didn't have a pilot light.</p> 
<p>Later, I had two apartments in Jacksonville with gas stoves. They came with 
pilot lights but I told the supers at both places not to ignite them. &quot;I 
don't cook much. I won't need the oven. I'll just light the cook top with a 
match when I need it.&quot;</p> 
<p>I didn't trust that trickling flame to stay alive in the middle of a cold 
windy night.</p> 
<p>Today, my gas stove top ignites with an electric spark. No pilot light 
needed. I bake and roast in the electric convection oven. It's the best of both 
worlds.</p> 
<p>So, why is gas better than electric? I'll let a pro tell you:</p> 
<p>&quot;Let me put it to you in one word: control,&quot; said Joe Harrold, 
professor of Culinary Arts at Florida State College at Jacksonville's North 
Campus. &quot;With gas, you can control the heat. When you shut it down, it is 
shut down. With electric, the burner is still hot for another 20 minutes.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Harrold said many of his students have never cooked with gas prior to 
enrolling but soon love its predictability. As for my fear of pilot lights, he 
said my respect for them is justified, and it is part of the curriculum.</p> 
<p>&quot;We teach them how to light it when it goes out. You can't just light 
a match and walk away. That's dangerous,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>It's dangerous for the obvious reason that you don't want gas filling a 
kitchen. But it's also a threat to job security to the rookie line cook who 
thinks he has heated the stoves in preparation for a day of cooking and upon 
his return finds them cold when he needs to use them.</p> 
<p>Cooking on a gas stove top is like playing a musical instrument. I can 
adjust the flame to the proper height. I can move the pot off the flame so just 
a portion of it is being kissed by the flame if I want to simmer something. It 
makes timing a meal so much easier.</p> 
<p>Now, there are drawbacks to gas. My old electric stove was a dragon. 
Boiling water on those hot coils took no time. I was afraid my gas stove was 
broken the first time boiled water on it. It seemed to take twice as long to 
come to a boil. Now when I get home, I fill a pot with water and let it boil 
while I change clothes and check the mail. By the time I'm ready to cook, so is 
the water.</p> 
<p>The next time I buy a gas stove (which I hope isn't for a while, but I 
covet stoves like some men do cars), I would want one with more high Btu 
burners. I have one larger burner and a medium one and two smaller ones. By 
moving pots around and positioning them not directly over the flame, I can 
still do slow cooking over the high Btu flame when necessary.</p> 
<p>Even with these drawbacks, I still prefer gas.</p> 
<p>There are new ceramic cook tops, but I am afraid of scratching them, as I 
can get a little rough and clumsy when I have four pots going at once. The new 
magnetic surfaces are space age, but I don't want to have to buy special pots.
</p> 
<p>Just give me fire on metal - cast iron preferably - and I am a happy guy.
</p> 
<p>We decided to install gas because it didn't add a lot of extra expense to 
the remodeling job. Our stove backs against an exterior wall. The gas company 
simply drilled a hole in the side of the house and ran the gas line straight to 
the stove.</p> 
<p>Because our kitchen is near the patio, I also had them run a line to the 
backyard so I could hook my gas grill to the same huge tank. Another fantastic 
advantage - I've never run out of gas while grilling.</p> 
<p>I used to have two small propane tanks when I grilled. The spare was always 
filled. Well, almost always; there was the time on my sister-in-law's birthday 
when I ran out in the middle of cooking and found myself with two empty tanks. 
Good thing the kid at the hardware store didn't have a date that night, because 
he was filling my tank after closing time. I still try to do business at that 
store because of that service.</p> 
<p>Changing gas bottles on a hot grill is also dangerous. Once, while my 
father was grilling steak, the bottle ran dry. Being a good son, I volunteered 
to change it for him. Of course, the empty bottle didn't come loose easily, and 
when I gave it a jerk to get it off the grill, the back of my hand slapped the 
hot grill bottom. The burn wasn't bad, but to this day Dad feels bad about that 
household accident. Don't worry about it, Pa, as I remember you generously 
treated it with some Scotch - you poured it in me, not on the burn.</p>

<p>Dan - Great column. There is NOTHING like cooking on a gas range. I also 
have the electric convection oven. Have to love those &quot;dual fuel 
stoves&quot;.</p> 
<p>I miss the local hardware store with the REAL customer service, they are 
few and far between.</p> 
<p>Glad to see dad took care of that burn the way a father and son should - :)

<p>I totally agree!!! I have cooked on gas my entire life except for a brief 
time when I had an apartment. During that time I did learn how to cook on an 
electric stove but there is NO comparison!<br>
 Gas burner and cast iron 
skillet! The only way to cook!</p>
