<h2>Be part of the action in 2012</h2> 
<h2>Enfield Volunteers &ndash; we need you</h2> 
<p>As the borough gears up for the London 2012 Games and the Queen&rsquo;s 
Diamond Jubilee, Enfield Council with the Volunteer Centre Enfield are 
appealing to residents and businesses to volunteer and become part of the 
action.</p> 
<p>Cllr Bambos Charalambous, cabinet member for Leisure &amp; Olympics, said, 
&ldquo;For most people, the Olympic and Paralympics Games happen in their own 
country once in a lifetime. So for those of us in London this year&rsquo;s 
Games and other events are a great opportunity to take part in some way with a 
local event or volunteer.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We have already established a cultural festival and the Edmonton 
Carnival, but I know that many people will want to welcome the Olympic torch 
into the borough on 25th July, encourage their children to take part in school 
sports and above all enjoy the Games. I do want people in all parts of the 
borough to have a chance to take part.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The best way to do this is to register an interest with the Enfield 
&lsquo;Family&nbsp;of 2012 volunteers&rsquo; which is a database of people who 
want to get involved with anything going on in Enfield during 2012 that is 
linked to the Olympics and Olympic values.</p> 
<p>And there are many ways that residents can make a contribution to 
Enfield&rsquo;s activities and to the Games.</p> 
<p>This includes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Stewarding events in the build up to the Games and helping with 
administration;</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Working on Enfield&rsquo;s Tourist Information desk at the Dugdale Centre;
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Helping with Enfield&rsquo;s own school torch relay event in May 2012;</li>
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Volunteering at the re - opening celebrations for Forty Hall, chosen as 
the borough&rsquo;s iconic 2012 Games building.<b> </b></li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Supporting the Enfield Festival and contributing to it. It starts in May 
2012 to the end of September 2012. Anyone with a special skill, sports talent, 
singers and dancers could be taking part.</li> </ul> 
<p>Cllr Charalambous added, &ldquo;This is a busy year with over 100 events 
throughout the borough involving voluntary groups. We also have a small fund 
for the Big Jubilee Lunch street parties on 2nd and 3rd June for the 
Queen&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee. So let&rsquo;s look forward to a summer of fun 
and pleasure.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The social action network www.i-volunteer.org.uk is being used to recruit 
volunteers to the &lsquo;Enfield 2012 Family&rsquo;<b>.</b></p>

<h2>Chickenshed to Perform At Dickens Celebrations</h2> 
<p>Chickenshed Theatre is delighted to be invited to join a celebrity cast in 
The Royal Theatrical Fund celebration of Charles Dickens&rsquo; bicentenary 
year in the presence of Her Majesty The Queen on Tuesday 14 February.</p> 
<p>Charles Dickens was instrumental in founding The Royal Theatrical Fund 
(formerly The General Theatrical Fund Association), the profession&rsquo;s 
oldest charity, and was the first chairman in 1839. The Queen, as patron of The 
Royal Theatrical Fund, will mark Dickens&rsquo; Bicentenary by attending a 
theatrical performance entitled<i>Mr Dickens and the Actors</i> by Philip 
Franks at the City of London&rsquo;s Guildhall.</p> 
<p>The stellar cast will include Derek Jacobi in the title role of Charles 
Dickens and Samantha Spiro as Queen Victoria.&nbsp; Other cast members include 
Samantha Bond, Stephanie Cole, Matthew Kelly and Eddie Redmayne.</p> 
<p>Charles Dickens, considered one of the greatest writers of the 19th 
century, is as famous on-screen and on-stage as on the page.&nbsp; He wrote his 
first of many plays when only ten (in 1822), was a keen amateur actor and had 
warm relationships with many leading actors, such as Macready.</p> 
<p>Following the performance, members of Chickenshed Theatre will join other 
Organisations for a private reception at Buckingham Palace where memorabilia 
from the Royal Collection of Dickens will be on display.&nbsp; The reception, 
hosted by Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness, The Duke of Edinburgh, 
celebrates the bicentenary of Dickens birth.</p>

<h2><b>Stephen James donate Teddies to the Kingfisher Ward, Chase Farm 
Hospital.</b></h2> 
<p>In the season of Giving, Stephen James gives back to the community.</p> 
<p>This December Stephen James MINI held a competition to guess how many 
teddies can you fit in the MINI!</p> 
<p>They placed a car outside the entrance of the David Lloyds Leisure centre 
in Enfield and lots of people took part guessing everything from 50 to 380. The 
winner received a family hamper from Marks and Spencer.</p> 
<p>One of Stephen James core values is to &lsquo;Make a difference&rsquo; so 
what better way to spread some Christmas cheer to donate the teddies to the 
children at the King Fisher Ward at Chase Farm Hospital. The Kingfisher ward 
sees children from new born up to the age of 16 years and receives no funding.
</p> 
<p>Each child on the ward was given a teddy, reindeer, snowman or penguin 
cuddly toy and the staff have held on to the remaining toys to give out over 
the Christmas period.</p>

<h1>&quot;CONalition&quot;?</h1> 
<p>EN Magazine responds to the decision to close Chase Farm A&amp;E and 
Maternity Units</p> 
<p>Enfield residents are waking up this morning to the news that The Secretary 
of State has decided to ignore them and close the A&amp;E and Maternity units 
at Chase Farm Hospital.</p> 
<p>The Prime Minister, when in opposition pledged to reverse the plans to 
close Chase Farm hospital when he visited the hospital in 2007 &ndash; was this 
an outright con to win local votes?.</p> 
<p>I have followed the fight to keep Chase Farm Hospital fully open over the 
last few years and have seen nothing that has made me believe this is the right 
decision.</p> 
<p>I am off the opinion, although the government denies this, that this 
decision is about money. I believe the local Health Trust has over spent on 
developments of Barnet Hospital and North Mid Hospital and the only asset it 
has to offset this is the land at Chase Farm Hospital, which it has already 
tried to partly sell off!</p> 
<p>The population of Enfield is predicted to increase by 40,800 over the next 
20 years (14%) with the biggest increases being in the 0-14 and 50+ age groups. 
This will create extra demand on health services locally.</p> 
<p>However the one place where there is space to build and expand hospital 
services is to be downgraded. How long before the builders move in?</p> 
<p>I was very pleased to see Enfield Council and Local MP Nick de Bois openly 
saying that this is the wrong decision and hope that they will join forces and 
do what ever they can to try and overturn this decision.</p>

<h2><b>New BMW 1 Series</b></h2> 
<p>Saturday the 17th September, Stephen James will launch the new BMW 1 Series 
with revised engines, more striking design, roomier cabin and improved 
technology.</p> 
<p>While this model may mark the entry point to BMW ownership, the German firm 
hasn&rsquo;t cut any corners. Not only is it roomier than before, it&rsquo;s 
cheaper to run, too, thanks to a new range of engines &ndash; including a 116d 
that will arrive next year, with 74mpg and 99g/km of CO2. This will be the 
first BMW to drop below the 100g/km barrier, and give exemption from road tax. 
It will be a hit with company car drivers and private buyers who are keen to 
cut their tax bills.</p> 
<p>The first difference you will notice is the front with the large 
&lsquo;kidney shaped&rsquo; front grille and with bigger lights on the front 
and back. This latest edition has grown in most dimensions over the first 
1-series:&nbsp;it is&nbsp;85mm longer overall, and sits 30mm longer. Front and 
rear tracks grow by 51mm and&nbsp;72mm respectively. BMW has kept the height 
identical but found 17mm extra width and delivers&nbsp;21mm morerear legroom. 
Luggage grows 30 litres to 360 litres with the seats up, and 1200 litres with 
the seats down.</p> 
<p>The New 1 Series is more eco-friendly, with reduced CO2 emissions and 
improved economy across the range. This is helped with Auto Start Stop 
technology, which is now standard in both manual and automatic versions. There 
are five variants available at launch: two petrol engined-models, and three 
diesels.</p> 
<p>The 118d and 120d use the same 2.0-litre diesel engine, but produce 143bhp 
and 184bhp respectively. Even though the more powerful version promises 0-62mph 
in 7.2 seconds, its CO2 output is as low as 119g/km, while fuel economy is 
65mpg.<br>
<br>
 Completing the range is a new generation of twin-turbocharged 
direct-injection 1.6-litre petrol engines &ndash; available as the 118i with 
170bhp and the 116i with 136bhp. For the first time in this class, the 1-Series 
is available with an optional eight-speed auto. As well as offering smooth, 
quick shifts, the new gearbox promises stronger efficiency than the manual 
models.</p> 
<p>Three normal and five metallic exterior paint colours are available. Other 
additions to the standard specification include a leather-covered steering 
wheel, chrome exhaust and keyless start.</p> 
<p>There are two range-topping versions the&nbsp;Urban and Sport. The Urban is 
more luxury focused, getting a wide choice of exterior styling options 
including white wheels, wing mirrors and trim, and a slatted grille. The Sport 
models have different alloys, revised bumpers and M-Sport suspension.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, the line-up comprises of revised versions of existing 
engines which are now quicker and more eco-friendly.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Enfield Council Statement on Government's decision to close Chase 
Farm Hospital A&amp;E and maternity services.<br>
<br>
 Doug Taylor, Leader of 
Enfield Council, said: &ldquo;</strong>The Secretary of State said he would 
listen to Enfield&rsquo;s residents and he has not. &nbsp;Closing the A&amp;E 
and maternity departments at Chase Farm Hospital is a slap in the face for 
local people who overwhelmingly support retaining these services.<br>
<br>
 
&ldquo;Enfield Council believes these services meet a genuine need in Enfield 
and their closure would have devastating effect on healthcare in our borough.
<br> .<br>
 &ldquo;Enfield Council will continue to fight for residents best 
interests and lobby tirelessly for these services to be retained.<br>
<br>
 
&ldquo;Enfield&rsquo;s population is predicted to increase by 40,000 over the 
next 20 years and birth rates are predicted to increase by 8.3 per cent in 
coming years, so there is a desperate need for the Chase Farm Maternity and 
A&amp;E units to be retained to meet future need.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;I would urge 
the government to reconsider this decision and listen to what the people of 
Enfield have said, namely that they value their local hospital and believe it 
provides vitally important healthcare to those most in need.&rdquo;<br>
<br>

<strong>Council recommendations to the Independent Reconfiguration panel.<br>

</strong><br>
 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary of state should require further DoH 
analysis of the strategic options produced by Barnet and Chase Farm Hospital 
Acute Trust which indicate costs and viability of alternative options to the 
Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Clinical Strategy. Local residents favour 
strategic option 1.<br>
<br>
 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Secretary of 
State should use the data produced by Barnet and Chase Farm Trust on the 
viability of full maternity and paediatric consultant led services on both 
Chase Farm and North Middlesex sites.<br>
<br>
 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of 
State should ensure that 24/7 Consultant led Accident and Emergency services 
are retained on the Chase Farm and North Middlesex Sites. In doing so 
additional primary care and community services, could assist with demand 
management and should be explored as part of this option.<br>
<br>
 4. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State should consult with the Hospital Trusts 
about joint arrangements across the hospitals to address workforce concerns, 
clinical issues and maximise patient services and patient choice.<br>
<br>
 5. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State should ensure the future financial 
sustainability of NHS services in Enfield by undertaking an urgent and 
transparent review of the funding formula for local PCTs<br>
<br>
 6. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Foundation Trust status the Secretary of State 
should take action to safeguard receipts (revenue and capital) from the Chase 
Farm site for reinvestment in front line NHS services in Enfield and at Chase 
Farm<br>
<br>
 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State should also ensure the 
future financial sustainability of NHS service in Enfield by providing funding 
to mitigate the impact of the Private Finance Initiative debts on local 
hospitals<br>
<br>
 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State should recommend to 
the emerging Enfield GP Consortium, that as it becomes established, it has as a 
leading priority the engagement with local stakeholders about how to build a 
future long-term consensus for service delivery and genuine innovation.<br>
<br>
 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State should ensure that priority must be 
given to improving the quality and availability of primary and community based 
services at the Chase Farm site.<br>
<br>
 10. The Secretary of State should 
recognise the benefit of local management of hospital services.<br>
<br>

<strong> </strong> <strong>Council motion<br>
</strong><br>
 Enfield Council 
has been a consistent commentator on the Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Clinical 
Strategy. In November 2010, the Full Council, with cross party support, agreed 
the following motion in response to the Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Clinical 
Strategy Review:<br>
<br>
 1) Patients and residents should be key in planning 
future facilities and their voice should be heard as the primary stakeholder in 
healthcare.<br>
<br>
 2) No decisions should undermine the quality and<br>
 
viability of North Middlesex Hospital.<br>
<br>
 3) The future of Chase Farm as 
a viable hospital must be guaranteed, providing the services that local people 
need, want and ask for.<br>
<br>
 4) Proper investment in our hospitals must be 
guaranteed.<br>
<br>
 5) Adequate funding must be made available by Central 
Government.<br>
<br>
 6) There can be no compromise of patient safety<br>
 in 
planning facilities.<br>
<br>
 7) In the longer term, Enfield residents want 
good value services at both the Enfield hospitals and there should be joined up 
thinking and working that ensures this occurs, which might result in a closer 
relationship than the current one.</p>

<h2>Home Secretary backs <em>&quot;I Love Enfield&quot;</em> campaign</h2> 
<p>A poster campaign started by a local printers after the riots in Enfield 
Town has been backed by Home Secretary, Theresa May.</p> 
<p>Fast Signs, of Colman Parade, Southbury Road, started giving away free the 
&quot;I Love Enfield - Keep Smiling&quot; posters in an effort to boost morale 
among shops and businesses in Enfield Town after the violence and looting of 
last Monday. Dozens of the posters are now on display in shop windows, helping 
to show that Enfield is getting back to normal and is 'open for business' once 
again.</p> 
<p>Enfield North MP Nick de Bois said, &quot;These posters from Fast Signs are 
a great example of the way people in Enfield have responded in such a positive 
manner to the dreadful events of last week. I think people want to focus on the 
good things to come out of this, and see the posters as a symbol of something 
optimisitc&quot;.</p> 
<p>Fast Signs, whose own shop window was shattered during the riots, are 
considering continuing the posters after an initial 100 print run in order to 
raise money for a local charity.</p> 
<p>Home Secretary Theresa May gave her backing for the campaign after visiting 
Enfield last Friday.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Local MP&rsquo;s fighting to STOP knife crime</h2> 
<p>Enfield North MP, Nick de Bois has written a <strong>joint letter</strong> 
with Southgate MP David Burrowes to Prime Minister David Cameron, calling for 
the government's tough new crime policies to also apply to under 18s.</p> 
<p>The government has outlined plans to create a new offence of using a knife 
to threaten or endanger a life, which will&nbsp;carry a mandatory six month 
prison sentence for those found guilty. However, Nick has raised in Parliament 
the fact that the new policy will not apply to those under 18 years of age.</p> 
<p>EN Magazine is backing this campaign. &ldquo;More and more young people are 
carrying and using knifes in our local community and we feel that members of 
the public should not have to face the treat of knife crime from anyone what 
ever their age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tourist Information Centre Launch &ndash;</p> 
<p>Enfield&rsquo;s first Tourist Information Centre makes its debut at the 
Dugdale Centre on Tuesday 6th July.</p> 
<p>And welcoming all visitors to the centre are two bright graduates, Lucia 
Okenve and Naveenia Virasami, who have been trained to a high standard in 
customer care and have learned all about Enfield&rsquo;s unique cultural 
attractions and hidden treasures.</p> 
<p>They also have a sound knowledge of central London and Hertfordshire and 
will be able to help all visitors with information about specific places of 
interest, transport details, shopping areas and hotel accommodation.</p> 
<p>Cllr Bambos Charalambous, cabinet member for youth, leisure, culture and 
Olympics, said, &ldquo;This is a much needed service in the heart of Enfield 
Town. It is easy to find near to Enfield Town station and major bus routes, and 
provides information about all the main attractions to entertain, as well as 
our home grown businesses and services throughout the borough.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It will be a hub for all kinds of information and will be a great 
help to anyone who wants to enjoy the borough but does not know how to get 
around or what to see.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Visitors include Enfield residents, their friends and families, 
other Londoners, UK domestic visitors and international visitors mainly from 
North America, Europe and China. Our information officers will make them all 
very welcome.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>An added interest at the centre is the shop which is showcasing the 
creative talent in Enfield with tasteful handmade products for sale by Enfield 
crafts people and artists.</p> 
<p>This includes: ceramics by Steve Harrison, jewellery and accessories by 
Monica Grande, jewellery and candles by Cher Morresey, aromatherapy products by 
Zuleikha Assenjee, heritage and walk guides from The Enfield Society, and 
paintings and prints by Geoffrey Wright.</p> 
<p>Centre manager, Eleanor Hunter, says, &ldquo;This is a rare opportunity for 
visitors to buy original handmade products and for artists and crafts people to 
sell and advertise their skills in the heart of Enfield Town. If local artists 
want to sell their work through this shop they should contact me on 020 8379 
3755.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&lsquo;Visit London&rsquo; project manager, Lael Scheckter, said, 
&rdquo;Enfield is establishing a firm base to introduce new people to North 
London and we welcome the great efforts being made to promote its arts and 
museums and the work it is doing with local arts and crafts people. The Tourist 
Information Centre will provide a high profile for the borough and add greatly 
to the London image.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3><br>
A Day Out In London</h3> 
<h3>April 2009</h3> 
<p>London is very difficult to leave. You could spend a lifetime there, let 
alone a holiday, without getting bored. But London isn&rsquo;t England: 
there&rsquo;s so much to see and do beyond the extremities of the Underground 
that some longer day trips are de rigueur. The same routes that bring millions 
of commuters into the capital daily can be used to advantage as highways to 
adventure. We&rsquo;ve selected ten of the best and, within minutes of 
breakfasting in the capital, visitors can be on their way to a stately home, 
seaside resort or historic city, confident they will be back in time for the 
nightlife.</p> 
<p>Seaside delights: Brighton. It was the fun-loving Prince Regent, later King 
George IV, who made this resort fashionable, building the exotic, 
oriental-style Royal Pavilion as his pleasure dome in 1822. Brighton 
hasn&rsquo;t been out of fashion since. City</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>and seaside combine in a heady mixture. Go out to sea without getting your 
feet wet by strolling along the pier. Renowned for its shopping and nightlife, 
Brighton&rsquo;s population is predominantly young, its pace frenetic.</p> 
<p>Centres of learning: Oxford, 60 and Cambridge. Two of the world&rsquo;s 
oldest universities are north-west and north of the capital respectively. 
Oxford was founded in the 12th century, beating its rival by a few decades. At 
both, you can go punting along the river, though the bicycle is the preferred 
means of transport. Neither has a central campus: Oxford &ndash; the 
&lsquo;city of dreaming spires&rsquo; - has 39 separate colleges; 31 make up 
the University of Cambridge. Stroll around the quadrangles or 
&lsquo;courts&rsquo; at selected times &ndash; usually in the afternoons (times 
vary). The cities have remarkable museums: Oxford&rsquo;s Ashmolean is the 
grand-daddy of museums, dating from 1683; Cambridge has the Fitzwilliam. Walk 
streets trod by innumerable famous folk: from J.R.R. Tolkien and Lewis Carroll 
(Oxford) to Charles Darwin and Maynard Keynes (Cambridge).</p> 
<p>Spa city: Bath. The Romans were quick to make use of the hot thermal waters 
gushing out of the rock that Bath stands upon. Tour their bath, then bathe in 
modern thermal pools (complemented by wide ranging spa treatments) at the 
Thermae Spa. Long fashionable, the city is full of elegant 18th century 
neoclassical architecture which has earned it World Heritage City status from 
UNESCO. Just 20 km west is a bigger neighbour: Bristol, with its landmark 
suspension bridge across the Avon Gorge; a lively arts scene; a new shopping 
hub, Cabot Circus; and the world&rsquo;s first iron-hulled ocean liner, SS 
Great Britain.<br>
Midsummer night&rsquo;s dream: Stratford-upon-Avon. This 
Heart of England market town put itself on the map in 1564 when poet and 
playwright, William Shakespeare was born. Tour his birthplace and other 
properties linked to the Bard. A new Royal Shakespeare Theatre is set to open 
in 2010; in the meantime, it&rsquo;s possible to take in a performance at the 
Courtyard Theatre. Nearby is Warwick, location of an iconic castle that brings 
medieval England to life, with all its chivalry, romance - and gore.</p> 
<p>Viking stronghold: York. Thanks to a fast train service, this historic 
walled city 337 km north of London is within the realms of day-trip territory. 
Attractions include a Minster church filled with rainbow-coloured stained 
glass; shopping along medieval cobbled streets, a chance to step back a 
thousand years to the city&rsquo;s Viking past at the Jorvik Centre; museums; 
regular festivals and daily ghost walks. A caf&eacute; culture is epitomised by 
Betty&rsquo;s, where tea and cakes is a gastronomic experience.</p> 
<p>Royal castle: Windsor. While York is many leagues beyond the capital, 
Windsor is almost next-door. Its focal point is world&rsquo;s largest and 
oldest inhabited royal castle, towering above the Thames. The preferred home of 
the monarch, you will know when Queen Elizabeth II is in residence as the Royal 
Standard flies from the ramparts. Don&rsquo;t miss Queen Mary&rsquo;s intricate 
doll&rsquo;s house with its working lifts and water system. An exhibition of 
treasures, marking 500 years since King Henry VIII&rsquo;s accession, runs 
until April 2010. Cross the bridge into Eton, famed for its boys&rsquo; school 
which has tutored 18 British prime ministers: see the exclusive graffiti on the 
desks!</p> 
<p>Home most stately: Woburn Abbey. Home to the Dukes of Bedford for 400 
years, Woburn is a feast of art and extravagance, embellished with fine 
furniture, old masters, gold, silver and porcelain. The tradition of afternoon 
tea reputedly originated here, circa 1840, and you can partake too, in the 
Duchess&rsquo; Tea Room. Outside, deer roam a spacious park, and there&rsquo;s 
a new exhibition of monumental sculpture.</p> 
<p>Green and pleasant land: the Cotswold Hills. Think picture-perfect towns 
and villages of golden stone, tea shops, and countryside of rolling hills and 
meadows, dotted with gardens and historic houses. One, Snowshill Manor, 
contains a collection of artefacts so large its eccentric owner was forced to 
live in an adjacent cottage. The region sweeps in a wide arc north-eastwards 
from Bath and is best seen by car or on a bus tour. Towns such as Chipping 
Campden, Broadway and Bourton-on-the-Water are deservedly popular. So 
delightful that many celebrities, from Kate Winslet to Liz Hurley, choose to 
live hereabouts.</p> 
<p>Luxury training: Orient-Express British Pullman. A train of opulent 
carriages with starched tablecloths, polished mahogany decor, and white-suited 
attendants, pulls out of London&rsquo;s Victoria station every few days. It 
heads for day-trip destinations including gardens of Kent and Sussex, Hever or 
Leeds Castle, with everything arranged, including fine dining as the 
countryside flashes by. Decadent perhaps, but a great way to celebrate a 
special occasion. Journey times are by train unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>What to do in your garden in mid-summer</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this at the end of June, after a hot, dry week in the 
gardens at Capel Manor and on my allotment. I&rsquo;ve been asked to pass on 
some watering advice as a lot of plants are beginning to flag in the heat: the 
strong breeze has made things dry out even more quickly. We typically only get 
20 to 22 inches (50 &ndash; 55 cm) of rain per year in the Enfield region which 
is the same as Beirut, which we tend to think of as a desert region! Other 
parts of Britain get two or three times this amount, so we need to water our 
plants more than other areas. It has certainly felt like this in the past 
couple of weeks as newly planted areas need a lot more water than just the 
small amount of rain we&rsquo;ve had to keep them alive.<br>
If you mulched 
your plants as advised in this column in early spring your established plants 
should be holding up well in the recent dry spell. Newer plantings of either 
bare-root or pot-grown plants are more likely to be suffering as their roots 
may not have spread out enough to reach the available water. The other problem 
areas are plants in containers, pots and hanging baskets, where there is little 
compost in relation to the amount of plant material they contain. The root run 
is obviously restricted to the container and the plants&rsquo; leaves tend to 
prevent any rain we do get reaching the compost&rsquo;s surface, compounding 
the problem. Compost tends to shrink in containers making re-wetting tricky and 
potentially wasteful of both time and water. I&rsquo;m now going to suggest 
some ways of making the watering process more efficient and easier.<br>
This 
time of year is when we are often away on holiday for a week or more so unless 
you have a gardener or a kind neighbour to water for you some of your plants 
will suffer whilst you are away. The most vulnerable are hanging baskets as 
they typically contain a large number of bedding plants which grow quickly and 
need lots of water. I&rsquo;d recommend setting up an automatic irrigation 
system running off a battery-powered timer: this is available from most garden 
centres as a starter kit for a reasonable price. The timer fits onto a mains 
tap and a pipe of typically 12mm diameter is conected to reach near to the 
hanging baskets that need watering. Smaller diameter pipes (4mm) are then 
conected to the feeder pipe and lead to micro jets or misters placed in the 
hanging basket, more than one may be needed if the basket is a large one. 
Depending on whterh you used water-retaining gel in the compost mix or not, you 
will need to water every other day or daily in the hottest weather. The best 
time to water is in the early morning before the sun becomes too strong: set 
the timer for 5 or 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning for 5 minutes to start with 
and keep an eye on things for a few days to check that enough water is reaching 
the plants. Watering in the morning means that evaporation losses are much 
lower and unlike evening watering the foliage doesn&rsquo;t stay wet for too 
long so reduces fungal problems.<br>
Containers and pots can also be watered 
using this system and I&rsquo;ve had up to 20 pots and containers watered at 
home using just one timer and feed pipe with lots of misters connected to it 
with no problems.<br>
Other ways of making pots and containers easier to water 
are to stand them in saucers which act as a reservoir of water, or group them 
together in gravel trays which you can fill up before going on holiday. Move 
your pots to a shady are if possible and cover them with horticultural fleece 
to reduce evaporation. Pots should have a watering gap between the top of the 
rim and the compost&rsquo;s surface of 1.5 to 3cm depending on the pot size 
(plastic pots usually have a moulded rim: if you fill with compost to the 
bottom of the rim this leaves the correct watering gap) and the best method is 
to fill the pot with water to the brim, leave 5 minutes and repeat, to ensure 
thorough wetting. If a small pot is completely dried out then try dunking it in 
a bucket of water for quick results.<br>
Recently planted bedding plants will 
only have shallow roots and will need extra water until they settle down. If 
you have a sprinkler licence then a sprinkler is a good way of watering a large 
area evenly and thoroughly, otherwise spot water with a hose or watering can. 
Spot watering is best for larger plants as just the soil around the plant needs 
to be watered and the bare soil will stay dry and this will help prevent weed 
seed germination. Water the soil rather than the leaves to prevent leaf scorch 
and make the watering more efficient. It is better to water thoroughly once a 
week than give plants a light water daily as light waterings can evaporate 
before the water reaches the plants&rsquo; roots. A quick scrape back of the 
soil will tell you how moist the soil is under the surface and how far the 
water has travelled into the soil. You will probably be surprised at how dry th 
soil is despite the watering you have just done. Ideally water in the early 
morning but lots of us don&rsquo;t have time to do that so the evening will be 
fine: do watch out for slug and snail problems as they will be attracted by the 
damp soil and head towards your plants, so control them suing your favourite 
method.<br>
Other watering equipment you might see at the garden centres 
include pop-up sprinklers for lawns (I don&rsquo;t water my home lawns and they 
always recover in the autumn when the rain increases) and porous soaker hoses 
made from recycled tyres, which I have found tend not to work in hard water 
areas such as ours as they block up with limescale too easily. Small pumps are 
available which can be used to run a hosepipe from your water-butt (this is 
legal even during a hosepipe ban) which is quicker than using a watering can.
<br>On to other things in the garden!<br>
Well we did warn you that we might 
see some frosts in May, and the middle of the month saw an overnight low of -5C 
in Capel Manor&rsquo;s Walled Garden. The same day a year ago had 7C as the 
minimum so that&rsquo;s a 12C drop &ndash; no wonder it felt cold! Fortunately 
things have warmed up now and the new plantings for the Queen&rsquo;s visit 
have settled in well. We&rsquo;re especially pleased with the new roses which 
are flowering well and putting on lots of new growth. Our routine maintenance 
includes removing the dead flowers (dead-heading) to encourage new flowers to 
develop, and checking for pests and diseases. The worst problems we&rsquo;re 
seeing at the moment are black spot, powdery mildew and aphid build up. If the 
damage looks as it&rsquo;s going to get too great then pesticide sprays are 
available: try to find one that won&rsquo;t harm the bees as they have suffered 
a sharp decline in numbers in recent years. Dead-heading will encourage 
repeat-flowering on a lot of garden plants eg dahlias so is worth doing unless 
you want to save the seed heads on the plant for winter interest, and many of 
them do look good with the frost on them in the winter sun.<br>
On to some jobs 
to do in your garden over the next couple of months.<br>
We&rsquo;re cutting 
the lawns at Capel weekly now, but if the dry weather continues we will raise 
the height of cut another notch to help prevent the grass from being stressed 
so much. Cutting the grass and edging the lawns is one of the quickest ways of 
making a garden look tidier. Some of the tall or floppy plants in the 
herbaceous borders need staking to keep them looking tidy, and if you do it now 
they will soon grow enough to hide their supports. Many spring-flowering shrubs 
can be pruned now: do check in a good gardening book though to make sure that 
you won&rsquo;t be removing next year&rsquo;s flower buds if you prune 
incorrectly. It is worth doing this though to keep the shrub in shape and 
healthy.<br>
Onto the kitchen garden! <br>
A lot of soft fruit will be ready to 
harvest soon and needs protecting with netting to prevent birds taking your 
crop. This applies especially to cherries and redcurrants, but once they have 
eaten them they will move on to the other fruit! Apples and pears need thinning 
out to give better sized and healthier fruit. Aim for clusters of no more than 
4 fruit, removing the short-stalked &ldquo;King Fruit&rdquo; and removing 
misshapen or damaged fruitlets, and a spacing of 10 &ndash; 15cm between 
clusters. Stone fruit such as plums and peaches also need thinning: plums in a 
similar way to apples and peaches to 10 &ndash; 15cm between fruits. 
Gooseberries need to be thinned: typically remove half of the fruit to allow 
the remaining crop to reach a larger size. The thinnings can be used for 
crumbles and pies!<br>
If you planted potatoes you might be lucky enough to be 
able to take a crop from your first earlies: mine have been delayed by a couple 
of weeks due to the heavy May frost cutting the foliage right back despite 
earthing them up. Pinch out side-shoots on tomatoes if they are a cordon 
variety but not a bush type. There is still time to sow quickly maturing crops 
such a stump-rooted carrots, lettuce, raddish etc.<br>
A final tip: a few 
minutes a week with a hoe in this dry weather quickly kills off weed seedlings 
and keeps beds and borders weed-free.<br>
Happy Gardening!<br>

What was the date of the official opening of Tower Bridge?*</p> 
<h3>Healthy eating in the school summer holidays</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p><br>
All parents want the best for their children but in the long summer 
holidays how can you ensure that their diet stays healthy and nutritious 
providing them with everything they need for now and their future.</p> 
<p>There is always so much in the news about healthy eating nowadays including 
most worryingly childhood obesity, but having a healthy child doesn&rsquo;t 
just mean maintaining a healthy weight. There are so many other aspects of 
human development that are influenced by the type of foods your child consumes. 
Babies and teenagers in particular are growing and developing at a phenomenal 
rate. This needs to be supported by a whole variety of vitamins and minerals 
alongside a specific balance of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, fibre and water.
</p> 
<p>Strong healthy bones <br>
Asking a youngster to start thinking about 
osteoporosis is like asking them to invest their pocket money in a pension! 
However in both instances it is best to start young and investing in bone 
strength is more likely to give better returns than investing in the stock 
market! Our bones are built up in our youth and once we hit our thirties their 
strength starts to decline. In order to avoid problems later on, one of the 
best things we can do is eat a diet full of calcium plus other minerals which 
help calcium to do its job. Calcium is found in dairy foods but also in green 
leafy vegetables, broccoli or seeds such as sesame or sunflower. Adding seeds 
to mueslis or using them as snacks is a good way to include these important 
foods in our diets. Tahini is made from sesame seeds and can be eaten with 
pitta bread or vegetables for dipping and may be something your child enjoys 
particularly if they already like the more well-known hummus.</p> 
<p>If foods are unfamiliar, introduce them one at a time not altogether so 
there are lots on the plate that the child does not recognise. Also remember 
that foods can sometimes be easily disguised and added to pasta sauces, mashed 
potatoes and other things with which they are already familiar.</p> 
<p>Vitamin D is vital for the functioning of calcium. Getting your children 
out in the fresh air can help to naturally increase vitamin D levels and 
improve bone strength. Vitamin D will be very limited during the winter months 
but can be stored in the body so it is particularly important to build up 
stores during the summer months.</p> 
<p>Exercise is also good for building strong bones &ndash; just the normal 
childhood games involving running and jumping as well as the more structured 
kinds such as football or dancing</p> 
<p>Fizzy drinks on the other hand are bad news because they can cause calcium 
to be lost from bones decreasing their strength. Intake of fizzy drinks should 
be limited. In preference use fruit juices diluted with water, or just 
encourage the drinking of plain water.</p> 
<p>Brain food<br>
Before the age of three the brain is developing particularly 
fast. Over half of the human brain is made from fat but a diet high in 
saturated fats (ice cream, biscuits, cakes and fried foods) is not the right 
kind. The best source comes from oily fish such as salmon, sardines or 
mackerel. These are all good on wholemeal toast for quick meals at home both in 
summer and winter. Once again the oils need other nutrients to help them 
convert to those &ldquo;little grey cells&rdquo;. Good choices would be pumpkin 
seeds, avocadoes, wholegrains (brown rice, pasta or bread). These could all 
form part of packed lunches on family days out over the summer.</p> 
<p>Boosting immunity<br>
Many parents find that that once their children are 
at school or nursery, they start to pick up one bug after another with a 
constant round of coughs, colds and sore throats. The immune system of a young 
child has not yet developed and this one of the reasons why infections can 
occur so often.</p> 
<p>Many of the foods mentioned above can also help to boost immunity. In 
addition berries, oranges and grapefruits are full of vitamin C which is vital 
for the immune system. Kids can help making smoothies which include these 
fruits. Try mixing them with plain probiotic yoghurts which are also good for 
helping the digestive system to keep healthy because of the friendly bacteria 
they contain.</p> 
<p>Establishing a good relationship with food <br>
Establishing a relaxed 
relationship with food is very important and for this reasons I suggest making 
sure that your child is following a good balanced diet for, let&rsquo;s say, 
80% of the time. Don&rsquo;t worry too much about the other 20%. I believe that 
if you are too strict about foods you can create a worse situation later on 
with them rebelling and binging once they are out of your clutches. You 
can&rsquo;t control what they eat all of the time, particularly once they are 
out and about with their friends over the summer months.</p> 
<p>It may also be best not to call foods &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or use terms such 
as &ldquo;being good&rdquo; in relation to food intake. Foods should also not 
be used as &ldquo;treats&rdquo; or as bribes or rewards. I advise this because 
it seems to help avoid setting up a pattern of comfort eating later in life 
which can lead to gaining weight and other health problems. There are plenty of 
other things that can be used for rewards &ndash; magazines or comics for 
example or trips to the park or swimming pool &ndash; even better!</p> 
<p>Try to replace sugary snacks with healthy alternatives &ndash; hummus and 
carrots or cucumber for example. Apples are excellent choices and great for 
energy levels. Including these in packed lunches is just as easy as biscuits or 
sweets.</p>
