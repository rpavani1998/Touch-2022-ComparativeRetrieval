<h1>Growing Tropical Plants in Non-Tropical Reqions</h1> <br>
<br>

<p>Tropical Paradise. We often see commercials of Tropical Vacations and dream 
of better days sitting under the sun with a drink in our hands. What is it 
about the tropics we so enduring? What lures us to these places? In colder 
climates during the winter months plants have acclimated to the climate. They 
can take freezing temperatures and months of snow and ice. However tropical 
plants are not capable of surviving these climates. But we still long for that 
Tropical fruit we buy in the store for outrageous prices. What if we could go 
over to a tropical tree, select a ripe fruit and eat it right then and there, 
while outside a blizzard is taking place? Our own tropical paradise, right 
inside out own home. Many tropical plants will grow with the right care and 
conditions in areas that normally would not permit them. These same plants that 
grow in abundance in Asia, South America, Africa, can grow right in your own 
living room, ready to pluck the ripe, sweet fruit grown specifically by you.<br>
<br> Potting<br>
<br>
 There are many different types of pots available and 
each has its benefits and drawbacks. There is plastic with can heat up or 
freeze quickly, Metal, same as plastic. Clay and wood dry quicker, ceramic that 
can be heavy and many others that you can buy at local garden centers. For the 
most part all can be used quite successfully with tropical plants. Choose one 
based on your own preferences.<br>
<br>
 These pots should have holes in the 
bottom for adequate drainage. When you buy your pot, and before you put in 
soil, cover these holes with a mesh of some sort to help retain the soil, it is 
also good to put down an inch or two of gravel to insure good drainage. With 
tropical plants drainage is essential to healthy plants.<br>
<br>
 Potting soil 
from the local garden center will suffice; however a much better solution would 
be 1 part Perlite or Vermiculite, 1 part course sand, and 1 part Peat. This 
gives good drainage as well as sufficient nutrients. Make sure your soil is not 
packed down heavy to allow good drainage but not excessive drainage.<br>
<br>
 
Remove your plant from its original container; look carefully at the root 
system. It they are heavily packed in and there is more root then dirt, we want 
to prune these roots before we plant. Take some of these roots and loosen them 
up and then carefully clip the ends to stimulate the plant to root more in its 
new container. If pruning is not needed, then just loosen the root ball before 
planting.<br>
<br>
 Place the plant in the new container making sure you have 
filled it halve way with the new planting material. You want to make sure that 
when you fill the rest of the container with soil, the soil line is the same as 
the original plant when you pulled it out. The soil like should be about 1-4 
inches below the rim of the pot when you are all finished.<br>
<br>
 Important 
key: Make sure your fully grown plant will be proportional to your pot. 
Don&#146;t put an 8 foot tall tree in a 10 inch pot. Allow the roots to be able 
to grow, the larger the pot the more fruit it will bear.<br>
<br>
 Light<br>

<br> Tropical plants usually require lots of sunlight, anywhere you can place 
them to receive full sunlight is beneficial to them. Search on the internet for 
your species to find out their light requirements. Some tropicals do well in 
partial shade however most need to receive the maximum sunlight available.<br>

<br> Tropical plants, when you receive them are most likely used to full 
sunlight, when you are going to bring them indoors, or for winter times, when 
bringing them indoors, you must acclimate them to your indoor area. Make sure 
to put them near a good light source and if possible add additional light<br>

<br> Water<br>
<br>
 Tropical plants are used to lots of water, however they 
are also used to well drained soil, so their water requirements are different 
for potted plants. These dependencies are based on size of the pot, size of the 
plant, type of plant, temperature where you keep the plant, the humidity and 
the type of soil you have. You are usually safe to water, when the upper 
surface of the soil is dry before you water your plant. Slowly fill the 
container watching for runoff at the bottom holes. Remember that wood or clay 
pots dry faster, making watering more frequent, and cooler weather slows down 
the growth of the plant, thus reducing the need to water as much.<br>
<br>
 
Temperature<br>
<br>
 This is probably the key ingredient to successful 
tropical plant keeping. NO FREEZING WEATHER. Tropical plants cannot take cold 
temperatures, so you will need to find a way to bring these indoors. Cold 
temperatures will lead to root damage, and leave damage. Again it depends on 
the species of tropical plant you have to the extent it can take cold weather. 
Some plants you can just cover overnight and then remove each morning, others 
will need to be brought indoors. If you bring them indoors make sure you keep 
them away from drafts from doors or windows to freeze, and out of the heating 
vent areas so not to dry out too fast.<br>
<br>
 Pruning<br>
<br>
 With most 
container tropical plants little or no pruning is needed. However if the plant 
becomes &#147;leggy&#148; due to poor light conditions then cut it back greatly 
to force it to bush out. If the top becomes too large for the root structure, 
again a large pruning spree is needed. Also when you start to get leaf shed and 
twig die back this is an indication that the root structure is not large enough 
for the top foliage and pruning is needed.<br>
<br>
 Fruitfulness<br>
<br>
 
Will I get fruit? This is the question we all ask. Is it worth the time and 
effort? Ask anyone that has a fruit tree planted in a pot, as they pick 
tropical fruit on a blizzard day of 10 below zero, and they will always tell 
you &#147;Yes!&#148; For the most part container tropic plants are dependant on 
the light source and size of the pot to how much fruit they will have. Most 
fruit trees will fruit in pots as long as we keep all of the requirements alive 
in our head. The larger the tree the larger the pot that is needed. Fruit will 
bear proportional to the size of the pot and plant. Please keep in mind that 
some fruit will need a presence of another cultivator to be able to fruit. 
Again check the specifics of your plant before you decide to buy it.</p>
