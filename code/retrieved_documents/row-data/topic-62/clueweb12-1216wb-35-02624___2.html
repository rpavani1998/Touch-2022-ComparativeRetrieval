<p> During winter I always seem to have a collection of tired, mossy, grubby 
containers lying around the house sporting disinterested plants that look as 
though they'd rather be dead.<br>
<br>
 My most recent tally included two big, 
round terracotta tubs that used to be white but are now white, green (moss), 
terracotta (the original material) and mud.<br>
<br>
 They contain two tired 
Mexican orange blossoms that have told me that although they do like dappled 
shade, they don't like endless rain and gloom. They've grown thin and leggy and 
don't look like flowering any time soon.<br>
<br>
 In the carport were two 
square concrete pots hosting a couple of straggly pink daisies, on the terrace 
a lovely aqua Morris and James ceramic olive pot with a bedraggled red banana 
palm in it, and alongside the carport three tall concrete pots with yuccas in 
them.<br>
<br>
 The yuccas look extraordinarily happy but the pots do not.<br>

<br> It was a rare day in the Far North - the first in a good three weeks it 
didn't rain at least once, sunny for the best part, and warm enough to make you 
think a glass of cool sauvignon might be a treat after the toil of the day.<br>

<br> Dealing with the containers seemed like the perfect job, since the soil 
was far too wet to put your hands in.<br>
<br>
 Because I have a very short 
attention span, and instant gratification is essential, within an eight-hour 
timespan I have to empty the containers, clean or paint them, replant them and 
reposition them.<br>
<br>
 And because I'm a change bunny, they can't simply be 
reconstituted as they were - the pots need a new identity, there must be fresh, 
vibrant, healthy plants, and they need to be placed somewhere completely 
different to give a new aspect to the garden.<br>
<br>
 It's quite a lot of 
work, but the upside is that freshly cleaned, painted or new containers give 
the garden a great lift in the middle of winter, and make it all look as if 
somebody terribly stylish really cares about it.<br>
<br>
 I'd counsel against 
painting terracotta containers a solid colour because they tend to come out 
looking a bit cheap and plastic-like, but you can paint them flat white, or 
another flat colour which can then be sanded back to reveal touches of the 
original material.<br>
<br>
 New terracotta is fine - it will soon look as old 
as the hills - and glossy ceramic planters are gorgeous for modern courtyards 
and terraces.<br>
<br>
 Getting your containers sorted is the easy part - 
figuring out what to plant in them is more of a challenge. Since it's winter, 
something that will look either lush or colourful, or both, is ideal.<br>
<br>
 
You may be tempted by those &quot;potted colour&quot; stands in the garden 
centre, but you could also consider something a bit more permanent and which 
could be transplanted into the garden at a later date.<br>
<br>
 The Asplenium 
bulbiferum fern is beautiful as well as very useful and makes a striking cover 
plant for shady situations.<br>
<br>
 Its lush, lacy foliage looks quite 
tropical and it loves the shade. It's a gorgeous container plant with fronds 
weeping gracefully over the edge of a pot. Just don't let it dry out.<br>
<br>
 
I'm having a love affair with camellias at the moment and have discovered that 
hybrids based on the small-leaf species, which have masses of little flowers, 
can be used as container plants.<br>
<br>
 I'm trying the utterly gorgeous 
Nicky Crisp in a container in a half-shaded corner of the courtyard.<br>
<br>
 
To keep these winter flowering container plants healthy, feed them regularly 
with a foliar or liquid fertiliser.<br>
<br>
 I have to admit that the most 
colourful plants in my garden right now are tangelos, mandarins and limes, 
reminding me that citrus looks brilliant in containers.<br>
<br>
 Lots of 
varieties are now available as dwarfs, so you can fill an outdoor living space 
with their colour and scent.<br>
<br>
 They need quite large containers and 
look especially good in half wine barrels if you can lay your hands on some.<br>
<br> <strong>Tips</strong><br>
<br>
 &nbsp;If you're going to be looking down 
into your freshly planted container, chances are you'll see a lot of soil. Not 
such a good look. To give new plants a bedded-in look, cover the soil with 
mulch. If you don't want to use bark, there are many other choices available, 
from crushed shell to coloured pebbles to flat stones to tumbled glass. If your 
container is wide-mouthed, there may be room to plant smaller plants beneath 
the main event, or add decorative rocks, pieces of driftwood or ornaments.<br>
