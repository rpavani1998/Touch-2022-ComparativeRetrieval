<h3>Planting the Seeds of Change</h3> <br>

<h4></h4> 
<p>Plant the seeds of change in your community! Students will create symbolic 
planting pots and complete an activity to demonstrate how their actions can 
benefit those less fortunate in their town.</p> <br>

<h4></h4> 
<p>1. Who in your community inspires you? Firemen? Teachers? Maybe your 
parents or someone you know volunteers at a soup kitchen or a nursing home. How 
do the acts of these individuals benefit your community and the people that 
live there?</p> <br>

<p>2. Think about your role in your community. What can you do to help out 
those in need or make your community a better place? Commit to making a 
positive change in your community. Write down your commitment on a piece of 
paper, and describe how it will benefit the people in your community. The most 
important part of making a commitment is following through on your promise. The 
following activity will illustrate the positive impact your actions can have!
</p> <br>

<p>3. Using Crayola Air-Dry Clay make a small flowerpot. Lay down newspaper or 
waxed paper over your work area for easy clean-up later. Start by gently 
kneading the clay to make it soft and pliable. Cover the outside of a small 
plastic cup with the clay by molding smoothing it with your fingers. Do not add 
clay to the inside of the cup as moisture will soften Air-Dry Clay. Let dry for 
at least 3-days. Firing or baking in a kiln is not necessary.</p> <br>

<p>4. When dry, draw your promise to the community on the flowerpot using 
Crayola Slick Stix&trade;. Stain Advisement: Slick Stix contain pigments that 
may stain clothing, fabrics and other household surfaces. Wear a smock to 
protect clothing and cover your work surface with newspaper. You can create 
symbols to represent your commitment or draw an entire scene around your pot. 
Look at artwork by Romare Bearden for inspiration! He used collage art to 
depict colorful scenes of his community. Try techniques like rubbing or 
smearing the Slick Stix with your fingers for interesting effects!</p> <br>

<p>5. Add potting soil and seeds to your pot. Follow the directions on the 
seed package to care for your plant, and watch as your seed grows into a 
strong, beautiful plant. Think about how following through on your commitment 
to your community will help it grow stronger as well!</p> <br>

<p><b>Adult supervision</b> is required for any arts &amp; crafts project. 
Observe children closely and intervene as necessary to prevent potential safety 
problems and ensure appropriate use of arts and crafts materials. Some craft 
items, particularly beads and buttons, are potential choking hazards for young 
children. Avoid use of such small parts with children younger than 3 years. 
Craft items such as scissors, push pins and chenille sticks may have sharp 
points or edges. Avoid use of materials with sharp points by children younger 
than 4 years. Read all manufacturers' safety warnings before using arts and 
craft supplies.</p> 
<p><b>Adult Assistance</b> is required for this arts &amp; crafts project.</p> 
<p><b>Crayola Modeling Materials including Crayola Model Magic&reg;, and Model 
Magic Fusion&trade;, Crayola Air-Dry Clay, and Crayola Dough&mdash;</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep away from open flames. Do not use to make candleholders, hot plates, 
trivets, or other similar objects that will be used or placed near fire and 
other heat sources.</li> 
<li>Do not put in an oven, microwave, or kiln. </li> 
<li>Do not make into vessels/containers that will hold unpackaged food. </li> 
<li>The use of modeling material to make items that look like food is 
discouraged for children younger than age 5 to avoid their confusion with real 
food.</li> 
<li>Unless sealed with a water-resistant glaze, do not make projects exposed 
to or immersed in water, such as boats or outdoor bird feeders. They would 
disintegrate when exposed to moisture.</li> 
<li>Crayola Dough&mdash;contains gluten (wheat flour) as an ingredient. </li> 
<li>Crayola Air-Dry Clay, Crayola Model Magic and Model Magic Fusion are 
gluten-free. However, they are produced on the same machinery as Crayola Dough 
which does contain gluten. Although the machines are cleaned prior to the start 
of each production run, there is a slight possibility that trace amounts of 
gluten from Crayola Dough may be present in the other modeling compound 
products. For information regarding specific ingredients or allergic concerns, 
please call our Consumer Affairs department at 1-800-272-9652 weekdays between 
9 AM and 4 PM Eastern Standard Time.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Mirrors, Picture Frames, and Plant Pots&mdash;</b>Close adult 
supervision is required when children use craft materials that could shatter or 
break. Handheld mirrors, picture frames with glass, ceramic pots, and similar 
breakable items may be used only by children 8 years and older. For children 7 
years and younger, use unbreakable materials such as wood or sturdy plastic 
picture frames, unbreakable mirrors, and plant pots that will not shatter into 
sharp edges.</p> 
<h4></h4> 
<ul> 
<li>For a public display, the class can plant a garden on school grounds! Have 
students make a label for their plants that symbolizes their commitment to the 
community. Place labels in the soil near each student&rsquo;s seed.</li> 
<li>Invite a guest from a local food bank, homeless shelter or nursing home to 
speak to the class. Students can ask questions and hear stories to help them 
recognize some community issues and find out how they can help.</li> 
<li>Monitor students&rsquo; success by watching the growth of the plants. 
Which plants flourished the most? What caused these plants to grow healthy and 
strong? Did any plants wilt? What could have been done to improve the 
plant&rsquo;s growth?</li> </ul>
