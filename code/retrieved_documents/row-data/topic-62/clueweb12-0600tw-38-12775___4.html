<h3>VIDEOS FROM THE YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC</h3> </li> </ul> 
<p>Can you really grow dwarf citrus indoors that will actually produce 
luscious fruit? You have probably seen these cute little trees pictured in ads 
in magazines and newspapers that are laden with fruit promising that you can. 
And it's true -- if you can meet the conditions that they need.</p> 
<p>In as little as three or four years after starting your dwarf citrus tree, 
you can be picking ripe lemons, oranges, limes or other kinds of citrus fruits. 
(While you can be successful in growing small citrus trees indoors from seeds, 
don't expect them to ever bloom and produce fruit.)</p> 
<p>If you would like to give growing a citrus tree a try, first inquire if 
local nurseries will sell potted dwarf citrus trees this spring. If not, you 
can look through that stack of seed catalogs that has been piling up on your 
coffee table. You will find dwarf citrus trees listed in the Gurney, Stark 
Bros. and Raintree Nursery catalogs, and probably others. You will find potted 
trees in some of the larger nurseries in the Seattle area. Or you can go 
online, where you will find scads of nurseries selling bare-rooted or potted 
dwarf citrus trees.</p> 
<p>Always check to see if the citrus trees being advertised are potted or 
bare-rooted. Potted trees will cost you anywhere from $15 to over $100 each, 
depending on the variety, size and age. Bare-rooted trees may be one year to 
three year plants; the cost will depend on the age of the starts, and they cost 
as little as $5.</p> 
<p>If you buy bare-rooted stock, your first task will be choosing the right 
sized pot. The root size will determine the size of the pot you need -- roots 
need room to grow for at least two years without becoming root bound. The first 
pot should be at least 9 inches in diameter. Terra cotta, plastic or ceramic 
pots will work. Every two or three years, depending on how fast your tree 
grows, you will need to transplant it into the next sized pot. Starting out 
with a very large pot will not work as well as graduating your plant to 
increasing larger pots as they grow.</p> 
<p>Unless you buy a tree already potted, you will need to buy a top-grade 
commercial potting soil that has very good drainage. Excellent drainage is 
essential for successfully getting your tree to bear fruit.</p> 
<p>Like many of your other house plants, dwarf citrus benefit from being moved 
outdoors in summer. When outdoor night temperatures are consistently in the 
mid-50s or higher, it's time to move them outdoors. Accustom your tree to the 
outdoors gradually. Start by placing it where it will be shaded all day. Then 
gradually move your tree where it will receive more and more direct sunlight. 
Reverse the process in late summer or early fall to prepare your tree to be 
brought back indoors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Planting, caring and harvesting </strong></p> 
<p>Indoor sunlight is another crucial factor. Dwarf citrus trees need at least 
six hours of sunlight, and eight to 10 hours is ever better. A room with a 
southern or southwestern exposure is ideal. If you haven't a room with that 
much direct sunlight, you can still grow citrus successfully under grow lights 
that are kept on for up to 12 hours a day.</p> 
<p>Citrus trees grow best indoors with 65-degree days and with night 
temperatures that don't drop below 55 degrees. Daytime temperatures in the low 
70s should not pose a big problem. But they won't grow with temperatures below 
50 degrees, and less than 40 degrees can cause their demise.</p> 
<p>Humidity in our homes usually isn't over 20 percent, but citrus trees need 
humidity that is at least 30 percent or somewhat higher. As with most of house 
plants, you will need to raise the humidity. The best option is to set up a 
humidifier near your house plants. A less expensive way is to set all of your 
house plants, including your citrus tree, on saucers partly filled with pebbles 
and water. Grouped fairly close together, all of them should thrive.</p> 
<p>Fertilize your citrus tree once a month with a balanced 20-10-10 
fertilizer, but only when it is actively growing from May through August. 
Whether you use a chemical or organic fertilizer, use one that is higher in 
nitrogen than phosphorous and potassium.</p> 
<p>There are a few pests that can be troublesome, including aphids, scale and 
spider mites. Monitor both the tops and undersides of the leaves frequently and 
eradicate pests before they become well established. You can usually remove a 
small scale colony by scrapping them off with your thumbnail. Smothering scale 
with summer horticultural oil will also do the trick.</p> 
<p>Small numbers of aphids can be squished between your fingers, killed by 
using a Q-tip dipped in alcohol or sprayed with insecticidal soap. Miticides 
are not a good idea for use indoors. Because mites are so small, you may need 
to use a magnifying glass to detect them. They can often be removed by washing 
them off with tepid water, but you will need to repeat the process every few 
days to finally get rid of them. Generally, insects are not a big problem 
indoors. Be sure to monitor your citrus tree carefully when you bring it back 
indoors in early fall.</p> 
<p>Pollination can be a problem indoors because of the lack of pollinating 
insects. You will need to be the pollinator. Some growers have luck by gently 
shaking the tree when it is blooming. Others hand pollinate by using a Q-Tip or 
artist paintbrush to transfer pollen from one blossom to another. You will need 
to play the part of a bee whenever your tree is indoors.</p> 
<p>When to begin harvest is best determined by trial-and-error, at least when 
you first begin growing citrus fruit. Pick a fruit that appears to be ripe and 
then taste it. You need not pick all the ripe fruit at once; your tree will 
hold fruit for some time. Instead, harvest whenever you have a yearning for a 
juicy treat.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Which kind of citrus should you grow? </strong></p> 
<p>The consensus seems to be that lemons are the easiest dwarf citrus fruit to 
grow for beginners.</p> 
<p>Improved Meyers is probably the best choice, but Eureka lemons are also a 
good choice. Mandarins are a popular choice, such as Clementine and Satsuma 
mandarins.</p> 
<p>Washington Navel is one of the hardiest oranges, but Trovita orange is 
another popular one.</p> 
<p>Key Lime and Bearss Lime are both excellent choices, although limes may not 
be the best citrus fruits to start with since they aren't used for eating out 
of hand.</p> 
<p>Even if you should never be able to get your dwarf citrus tree to bear 
fruit, you will still have a beautiful plant with foliage that shimmers and 
will stand out from all your other plants.</p>
