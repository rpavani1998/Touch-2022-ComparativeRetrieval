<li><b>Adrian College</b> - Art &amp; Design&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>[Website]</i> <br>

<i><b>Adrian, Michigan, USA</b></i>
<p>The Department of Art and Design teaches the &quot;how&quot; of art; how to 
draw what you see, how to make a photograph, how to use Auto-Cad, or how to 
throw a pot. The important question in art-making is the &quot;what&quot; of 
art; what is your art about? How does your art relate to the world around you? 
Those are questions best answered in classes about History, Psychology, 
Sociology, or other subjects. At Adrian College, you not only get to explore 
the art studio, but you get to explore the world as well.</p></li>

<i><b>Bergen, Norway</b></i>
<p>The main focus is on clay as a raw material, ceramic techniques and 
processes. Courses focus on themes such as function (ceramics for use, applied 
ceramics), architecture and space, sculpture and installation. Prominent modes 
of artistic expression use ceramic materials and techniques as a source of 
structure and content.<br>
 When ceramic traditions converge with tendencies in 
contemporary art, innovation often results. We draw on the rich history of 
ceramics as a resource in contemporary practice. Courses cover ceramic 
production techniques, surface treatment and firing methods. Today's art scene 
is complex, and in this programme we want to encourage appreciation of art as 
well as artistic diversity. Ceramics is connected to past and present in both 
applied art and visual art - and takes place between the two.</p></li>

<p>The ceramics program offers the serious student an opportunity for an 
intensive studio experience that begins with an introduction to a variety of 
contemporary approaches to clay and ends with a focused, highly personal final 
project. Students are encouraged to incorporate other materials into their work 
and, as a result, often mount shows that reveal a surprising level of skill and 
variety. this interplay of materials results in a healthy interaction among the 
sculpture and ceramics students in Building B-66. MFA and BFA candidates in 
ceramics have individualized work space and play a strong role in the 
day-to-day workings of the studio. Ideas, materials, techinical information, 
and equipment are shared in a way that brings students and faculty--and often 
guest artists--shoulder to shoulder to solve problems, provide supports, and 
share creative victories. Ceramics students have particpated in NCECA student 
exhibitions and regularly attent the national conference. Advanced ceramics 
students have their own gallery exhibition at BYU every November. Former

<p>To step into this traditional field, students previously had to enter an

developed at Kyoto Seika University is more appropriate to this university`s 
atmosphere, emphasizing a view of ceramics as a modern and creative art form, 
using clay as a medium of self-expression. We encourage students to be 
imaginative and diverse in their thinking. We do not believe in teaching 
ceramics: instead, we believe that our job is to stimulate the creativity of 
each individual. Students must themselves overcome the initial obstacles that 
occur when working in this field. During our four-year program, students absorb 
the technical side as well as the human side of this art form. These two 
aspects cannot be separated, as techniques are always selected according to 
human considerations.</p></li>

<p>The historical place of Ceramics in the history of humanity is a 
significant part of study in this program. Students are instructed in the role 
of ceramics products in our society from ancient burial urns to the tiles of 
the space shuttles to the fabrication of ceramic engines. Aesthetics and design 
are an essential part of the instruction. Problems presented in the courses 
require focused attention to resolve through design. Advanced students develop 
their own glazes, help design and build kilns. Various firing processes 
available in the Ceramics lab include: reduction stoneware, raku, soda vapor, 
saggar, and oxidation. Experiential Learning has assisted students in deciding 
their career choices. Several students have apprenticed with local potters. 
This has given them insight into what is required to become a professional 
studio potter as a career.<br>
 There are fourteen potters' wheels including 
one for wheelchair access. Fabrication tools include a 36&quot; Brent Slab 
Roller, a 4&quot; extruder, and a small extruder. and large work tables. A wide 
variety of glaze chemicals allow students to experiment for the desired results 
on the surface of their work. A ball mill assists students in experimental 
glaze preparation and in preparing terra sigilatta. The firing power is 
provided by a 27 cu.ft gas kiln, 60 cu.ft. car kiln, 21 cu.ft. soda vapor kiln,

<p>Ceramics at MSU provides a rigorous curriculum of study that encourages 
students to explore the medium of clay as a means of developing personal 
sensibilities and giving expression to a wide range of experiences. 
Experimental in nature, the program allows students to work with clay in its 
pure form, or to combine it with mixed media to develop unusual and unique 
pieces. Students may elect to explore vessel or sculptural forms during their 
course of study and often choose to do both. Advanced students experiment with 
porcelain, stoneware, terracotta, earthenware, paper clay, raku, and adobe, and 
also learn to fire their own kilns. Strong technical development and 
understanding of the science of ceramics is emphasized alongside expressive 
growth.<br>
 The Ceramics Studio contains three large Alpine kilns, several 
raku kilns, four large and three smaller electric kilns, eighteen pottery 
wheels, a clay mixer, slab rollers and an extruder. This equipment supports the 
exploration of sculptural and vessel forms in porcelain, stoneware, terra

 Program philosophy: UF Ceramics Program is one of the 
major programs in the southeast, designed to promote growth in 
aesthetics,technical knowledge and conceptual approaches. In the graduate 
program individual tutorials, group seminars, and critiques provide a variety 
of settings for development and exchange of ideas relevant to artist in 
general, and ceramics in particular. The strength of the program lies in its 
diversity; no one style, aesthetic, or technical focus is stressed over others. 
Experimentation is encouraged. The curriculum addresses the broad range of 
perspectives found in contemporary Ceramic art, from sculpture to 
vessel-reference works, to pottery and includes historical and contemporary 
references. The faculty believes that the ability to evaluate and discuss work 
should extend beyond one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s personal studio involvements. The 
faculty regularly engages all students regardless of sculpture, vessel or 
pottery orientation.<br>

<p>The ceramics program introduces students to the unique synthesis of form 
and surface that constitutes work in clay. Its goals are to provide basic 
knowledge of ceramic techniques and materials, to foster the development of a 
personal idiom, to promote the development of critical thinking skills, to 
encourage discussion of ceramics related ideas and issues, and to give students 
experience in working with studio equipment and materials in a safe and 
productive manner. Students are exposed to the techniques, forms and 
expressions of the major traditions of ceramics, those of vessel, sculpture, 
and architecture.<br>
 In the undergraduate curriculum, materials-related 
skills and knowledge are taught at the introductory level. Advanced courses 
concentrate on problem solving, idea development, and critical thinking, 
leading students to a personal approach to expression grounded in an 
understanding of ceramics history and tradition. .<br>
 The program has also 
developed summer international programs, sponsoring visiting artists from

<br> In the Studio Arts, majors can choose their emphasis from a variety of 
disciplines including digital art, painting, drawing, ceramics, and sculpture. 
The built-in flexibility of the studio curriculum encourages students to 
explore and develop their talents and interests. While specialization in the 
traditional sense is open to all majors, the department also encourages 
innovative approaches by exploring areas in which different media and 
disciplines fruitfully overlap or intersect. The B.F.A. in Studio Arts is 
specially addressed to students who aim to continue their education as artists 
at the graduate level.</p></li>

<i><b>Cullowhee, NC, USA</b></i>
<p>The Introductory Ceramics course provides a foundation in hand building, 
wheel throwing and glaze mixing. Upper division courses, taught in a separate 
studio which offers dedicated wheels and work spaces for each student, center 
on the exploration of a wide range of clay forming techniques, both functional 
and sculptural, as well as clay and glaze mixing and a variety of firing 
methods. An optional Tilemaking course introduces the production of multiples 
and offers a broad investigation of surface decoration. Visiting artists are 
drawn from the region as well as nationwide, and the annual Godfrey Seminar in 
the Business of Crafts addresses the business aspects of operating a studio. 
Student ceramics sales each semester help to fund student attendance at 
statewide and national clay conferences, and field trips to nearby studios and 
galleries draw on the rich resources of Western North Carolina in both 
traditional and contemporary ceramics.</p></li>

<h2>More Information</h2> This is the temporary home of our ceramic schools 
list. We anticipate the list will grow to a thousand schools or more. In future 
we will convert it from a list format to a search engine format. It will 
provide students a first-level information resource and give them new 
opportunities to investigate attendance in other countries.
<h2>Register Your School</h2>Visit the Digitalfire website and click the 
Register link near the top of the page.
<h2>Who will administer the list?</h2> You will. The site is self 
administering, every school will have the ability to edit the information on 
the site.
<h2>Will this site last?</h2> We are confident that this will be the best site 
of its type on the internet. We are long-time providers of ceramic resources on 
the internet and intend to make this site succeed. Instead of setting the 
unreachable goals that other sites have set for general documenting of 
gradschools, we have set a narrow focus on institutions with ceramic arts or 
technology programs. Some of our current reference sites have been up since 
1995/96. Our list of ceramic consultantshere has been active since 1998. 
<h2>Why is Digitalfire Corporation the one to do this?</h2> We make ceramic 
chemistry software that is used to understand and control glazes in ceramic 
industries such as whiteware, sanitaryware, tile, porcelain, stoneware. Our 
software and books are used around the world in education and by material 
suppliers and potters and we have been in business since 1980. We have built a 
very large list of influential contacts in ceramic industry and education, we 
understand the ceramic processes and the mineralogy, chemistry and physics of 
ceramic materials. Our mission is to help industry and individuals see the 
power of ceramic technology and to bring this knowledge within the reach of 
everyone. We have state-of-the-art experience and knowledge of internet 
programming and site building as well as powerful web servers to host new sites.
<h2>It this a commercial endeavor?</h2> No, no one will be charged for a 
listing, no preferred search listings will be sold. It is possible that we 
might sell some banner ads at some point to help finance the site. This part of 
our site is part of our effort to make it easier for people to educate 
themselves in ceramic technology. The main spin-off benefit that we will 
receive is increased software sales to students who adopt a desire to 
understand glaze and material chemistry as a result of finding a school that 
teaches this type of technical knowledge. <br>
