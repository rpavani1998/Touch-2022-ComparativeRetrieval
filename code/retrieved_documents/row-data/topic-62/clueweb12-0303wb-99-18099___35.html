<h4>Ahrenkiel, Dorte<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>All my pots are thrown on a potter&rsquo;s wheel in the first place. Some 
of these pots I cut and alter to put them together in different shapes. Using 
this old technique I create square, rectangular or triangular forms. I work 
with clays from Germany and French Gr&egrave;s. I often mix these clays adding 
porcelain grog. Apart from stoneware I also work with porcelain...</p> <br>

<h4>Akroyd , Stuart<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&ldquo;Since the first moment I worked with hot glass I knew I had found 
the medium I would use for the rest of my career. I love using glass, where the

<p>LESLEY ALLEN DRING<br>
 Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College<br>
 
BA (Hons) Ceramics and Glass<br>
 &quot;Sand cast glass is a beautiful means to 
create a three dimensional picture with texture and light. In some pieces I use 
wire, metals or minerals to create the picture. In others, I simply polish away 
the high areas to expose unexpected patterns and textures.</p> <br>

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Ceramics has been a family tradition spanning four generations at least.

<br> 
<h4>Bayless, Hayne<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Hayne says &quot;<br>
 &quot;The unintended result, often misread as a 
mistake and so dismissed, is one of the most fertile sources of new ideas. The 
trick is not to fool with clay's inherent desire to be expressive.<br>
 Pay 
attention to the clay, not only for the sake of each piece, but because the 
clay will offer - or impose - its own suggestions of new forms and ways to 
work...</p> <br>

<h4>Bayley, Nicola<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>I produce sculptural forms comprising of multiple elements that address the 
relationship between the formal qualities of line, scale, shape, material, 
colour and texture. This body of work is influenced by architecture and the 
minimalist approach to form. I am particularly inspired by Modernist 
structures, with their clean sharp lines, simplicity of form and innovative use 
of materials...</p> <br>

<h4>Beavan, Jenny<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Jenny says<br>

<h4>Brierley, Ben<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Ben says - <br>
 &quot;My ceramic work is wheel thrown and altered using 
stoneware and porcelain clays. Forms seek to utilise and respond to the 
malleability of the material and work is altered and assembled while still wet.

pieces are glazed and fired again in a raku kiln, a process which Liz finds 
exciting and stimulating. The...</p> <br>

capture characteristics of an environment in an object...</p> <br>

<h4>Cochrane, Rosemary<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Salt glaze firings continue to fascinate me, with the search to find a 
balance between the predictable and the unexpected. The effects of a rich

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>My inspiration is drawn from the intricate shapes and textures I observe in

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>I use a variety of coloured and textured clays to create distinctive coiled

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&quot;Through my work I want to highlight the preciousness of life and the

<h4>Debus, Monika<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Monika makes two-tone slab-built stoneware vessels which are low salt-fired 
in a *reduction atmosphere.<br>
 &quot;My particular kind of stoneware differs 
from that of my peers as it concentrates firstly on painting, and secondly on 
the vessel and its form, and therefore I complement the simplicity of my 
painting with a basic slab building technique...</p> <br>

<h4>Denson, Sue<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Landscape and the human form were the initial stimulus for my current work. 
This has transmuted into pieces that have a life of their own depicting the 
place that women have in the natural world.<br>
 The use of brick clay, has 
added to the natural texture of the work which is influenced by the interaction 
between myself and this primeval, unrefined material...</p> <br>

<h4>Ducker, Rachel<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Rachel sculpts wire into human forms to create intriguing and stunning 
pieces. Well practiced in life drawing combined with being trained as a 
jeweller led Rachel to experiment with this medium and the results are truly 
captivating. Each sculpture is featureless and so it is the posture which says 
everything about the pieces, the hands being the main tools of expression.</p>

<h4>Dyer, Sue<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&quot;I have been influenced by Ikebana, the Arts of Japanese Flower 
Arranging, which I have studied for several years. Together with this and the 
influence of other Japanese Art, I have explored the use of asymmetrical forms 
using the natural colour of stoneware and porcelain clay, enhanced by stained 
inlay decoration...</p> <br>

and also in London, Cheltenham and Bath...</p> <br>

<h4>Flint, Andrew<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>All of these works are hand built in stoneware clay using the coiling 
method and fired individually. Each piece may take 3 - 4 months to complete 
While much of Andrews past work could be described as sculptural, it is only in 
the last few years that he has started designing and making pieces that sell 
through sculpture parks and gardens...</p> <br>

<h4>Flo, --<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Natural looking stones with interesting shapes and colours are the main 
inspiration behind my work.<br>
 Whether it be a combination of complimenting 
stones or the simplicity of just one stone by itself, every piece is unique and 
attention grabbing.<br>
 Current designs involve the use of semi precious 
stones such as labradorite, kyanite, aquamarine and African brass.</p> <br>

<h4>Ford, Kim<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Kim is a designer maker based in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. Working 
mainly with Raku and smoke firing processes, he aims to produce pieces that are 
contemporary in design but which retain the integrity of a longstanding 
practice. Kim utilises many traditional methods, but does not ignore 
developments and improvements that can result from inspired experimentation.</p>
<br> 
<h4>Forster, Matt<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Initially, Matt's work has a sense of perceived simplicity. The heightened 
colour values are realised by a series of controlled watercolour washes 
empathetic to the screen-printing process.<br>
 The methodical layering of the 
separate washes, applied dry on dry, allows the surface to open up a much 
broader palette...</p> <br>

<h4>Fowler, Georgina<br>

<p>Georgina says<br>
 &quot;I&rsquo;m a recent graduate of Hereford College of 
Arts.<br>
 I make handmade slip cast earthenware vessels and plates.<br>
 Each 
vessel and plate is decorated with ceramic transfers which I have designed 
myself. These designs are inspired by fairy tales, imagination and the surreal.
<br> Each piece is unique in how I <br>
 place the transfers.&quot;</p> <br>

<h4>Fowler, Penny<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Penny uses porcelain and bone china clays. She makes moulds in which she 
casts her forms which enables her to make very thin fine forms, often using 
layers or inlays of different coloured slips. The forms are then hand carved 
and then finely sanded to achieve a natural smooth &quot;pebble&quot; like 
quality. She often make forms that link together as pairs...</p> <br>

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Michelle's ceramics are functional yet stimulating and inspirational. </p>
<p>Michelle says-<br>
 &quot;My pieces to date are a mix of hand built, press 
mould, and thrown techniques. I use stoneware clay, incorporating slips and 
oxides into a scratched surface. Most include snippets of thoughts or poetry 
written during my travels or when the subtleties of an environment evoked me...

<h4>G&oslash;tzsche , Ninna<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Ninna says of her work, &ldquo;I like my pots to be harmonious and 
simplistic - because I then have the freedom to play with them. Make one lean 
one way, have an unusual detail one another. I try to work with simplicity in 
order to give those details more room. My work is white porcelain with inlaid 
lines of colored clay. The lines play with the simple, yet often surprising 
forms.&rdquo;</p> <br>

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&quot;My work is wheel thrown and turned with high precision. I love the 
symmetry of the wheel and the ability it gives me to control shape and form. I 
use a very fine clay with no added grog. After turning I burnish the clay 
surface until the surface is completely smooth.<br>
 The shapes I love to make 
most are round, like the traditional clay containers made in the rural parts of 
Africa...</p> <br>

<h4>Godfrey, Richard<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>The inspiration for my work comes mostly from the coastline and countryside 
around my studio. Ideas for forms are often derived from things that I pick up 
on the beach. Shells, bits of wood, plastic bottles, in fact just about 
anything. I walk a great deal and usually find things in the hedgerows to 
inspire me. I love natural forms like insects, seeds and berries...</p> <br>

<p>Inspired by the mountaineous landscape of her home country Austria and 
constructed from soft slabs of clay, Regina Heinz&rsquo;s pieces display an

<h4>Hoadley, Thomas<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>My current ceramic work reflects an investigation into several areas of 
interest and an attempt to unify solutions to various visual problems. One 
interest is in the vessel as an abstract sculptural form and its many 
associations, both literal and metaphoric. Another is pattern and color and how 
a collection of abstract elements can create various feelings or impressions...

<h4>Hoffman, Beatrice<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Artist&rsquo;s Statement by Beatrice Hoffman<br>
 Creating my sculptures, I 
experience the ebb and tide of external sensations, and internal moods and 
feelings more intensely; the seclusion of the studio, and the seemingly 
repetative working process of refining surfaces enables a mixture of compulsion 
and reflection, that leads to a depth and essence in my experience and the 
ensuing vision.<br>

<h4>Hopkins - Gibson, Thomas<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Thomas&rsquo;s fascination with the form and texture of wood is evident in 
his work; replicating wood is not his goal, it is the starting point that takes 
him from the wood turning lathe to the plaster cast, to hand building and back 
to the lathe in an association of ideas that informs and educates as it 
evolves...</p> <br>

<h4>Howells, Joanna<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&quot;My work concentrates on form and texture. I make pieces which are 
simple yet have a softness, a freedom and a sculptural quality.<br>
 I work in 
porcelain, for its innate beauty and because its smoothness allows the use of 
subtle textures. The pieces are altered to both exploit and escape the soft 
cylinders and circles imposed by the wheel.<br>
 I'm often asked about sources 
of inspiration....</p> <br>

<h4>Ivanov, Orli<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Orli&rsquo;s approach to sculpture centres around mortality, it captures 
the conflict between material disintegration and intellectual fortitude. The 
mind, subjected to the needs of the primordial body, drowns in desperation. The 
inability to exist beyond it&rsquo;s primitive self impedes the unremitting 
pursuit towards enlightenment...</p> <br>

<h4>Nakajima, Hiromi<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Working with animals makes me very happy, and one way I can share this is 
through the ceramics I make.<br>
<br>
 Animal behaviour is so expressive and 
entertaining that I feel as if they can almost talk.<br>
 I believe that 
smiling is very important in life, and it is my hope that the animals I create 
will, in turn, bring a smile to your face.</p> <br>

<h4>Partington, Janine<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>I am a designer-maker based in Bristol combining the traditional craft of 
enamelling with fresh, clean, contemporary design.<br>
 Enamelling is the art 
of fusing glass onto metal. Watching an enamelled copper panel emerging from a 
kiln glowing red hot after being fired at a temperature of 800&deg;C is always 
an exciting experience. As the metal cools the true colours of the panel 
emerge...</p> <br>

<h4>Percival, Anja<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>I am a printmaker, and the majority of my work combines collagraph and 
etching techniques to build up multilayered imagery with rich, textural 
surfaces. My prints utilise both representational and abstract elements, to 
produce images that portray my experience of the landscape.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by the different atmospheres that light creates in both our 
rural and urban environments...</p> <br>

<h4>Perring, Susie<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Nowadays I work almost entirely in aquatint (images made up entirely of 
tones, with no drawn lines) or make monoprints painted directly on the printing 
plate.<br>
 I love aquatints for the range of contrast possible, and for the 
velvety effect it gives, especially with darker colours...</p> <br>

<h4>Phelps, Barbara<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>After a career teaching, Barbara graduated recently as a mature student in 
Visual Arts.<br>
 Her work both in ceramics and painting refers to the 
influence of man on the environment. Changes in colour and shape of the earth 
are remnants of industry which can be represented by oxides and volcanic glazes 
or by textural surfaces.</p> <br>

honey and clear glazed finishes...</p> <br>

<h4>Phillips, Jonathan<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&quot;My work is made to be used and enjoyed. It is all thrown using a 
stoneware clay. I keep the forms as simple as possible, working on the subtle 
variations and contrasts that highlight one form from another.<br>
 For the 
surfaces I layer slips and glazes, to create a rich and varied effect, and use 
a combination of dipping, pouring and hakeme to make spontaneous marks which 
compliment the form.<br>

<h4>Puga, Maria<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>My work explores ways ceramics can fuse the boundaries between craft and 
society, by closing the gap between art and communities. I explore and apply 
ideas of cultural identity and social change by using interaction as part of a 
performance, bringing attention to objects roles in certain social contexts...

<p>Landscape Series<br>
 &quot;The energy of landscape informs my ceramic, its 
influence and rhythm echoed in the marks drawn, painted and scribed directly

 I hand build using coils of stoneware clays; the physical 
process energised, reactive and intuitive. The surfaces of the large forms are 
created when the clay is still raw, vulnerable and at its most responsive...</p>

<p>For many years I had been getting increasingly tired of the constraints of 
slip casting and glazing and had been searching for a freer way of working. 
Since 2000 two events have been central to my new way of working. A Jane 
Perryman five-day course and a trip to Malawi, working with Malawian potters, 
changed my whole outlook and presented me with a wealth of new possibilities...

Salt Glazed in a 60 cu.ft. kiln that is fired with propane gas and the other 
half in my old and trusted oil fired kiln of 75 cu.ft.<br>
 Salt Glazing is an 
exciting, but often less than predictable, method of firing pottery. As the

<p>Sarah Ross-Thompson is a Fine Art Printmaker specialising in hand-inked, 
original collagraph prints inspired by the Dorset landscape.<br>
 Using 
carefully built collage blocks, her work combines the vibrant colours of 
oil-based printing inks with the textural qualities of the materials she uses. 
This combination produces a distinctive look that makes her work instantly 
recognisable...</p> <br>

<h4>Ross, Vivienne<br>

<p>There are only a few potters who use figurative decoration and 
Vivienne&rsquo;s work displays a number of qualities not least being a sense of

smiling. Figures are draped around her vessels in characteristic style with a 
good eye for balance and elegant draughtsmanship...</p> <br>

<h4>Rossman, Fritz<br>

<p>It was traditional slipware as well as 18th and 19th century porcelain I

35 years old when I finally left my career as a research technician to follow a 
long cherished idea...</p> <br>

<h4>Saddington, Patricia<br>

<p>&quot;Although my ideas and inspiration come from the Cornish landscape, 
especially West Cornwall, people often say my paintings remind them of other 
landscapes, usually a place or a time that has a special meaning for them. This 
is not unexpected as when we look at an abstracted image we bring to it our 
visual memories. So for each of us it has its own meaning&quot;.</p> <br>

<h4>Trotman , Andrew<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Combining a background in structural engineering and a passion for working 
with wood, Andrew's designs explore structured and goemetric forms which 
interpret the landscape; and express characteristics of balance, stress, light 
and texture...</p> <br>

<h4>Tudball, Ruthanne<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Manipulating soft clay on a revolving wheel and feeling the material 
respond to the merest touch is like setting out on an exciting journey for me. 
The dialogue that goes on between the maker and the clay is carried out through 
the use of the pots. You pour, you eat, you store, you serve and you drink from 
them, and sometimes you just contemplate them...</p> <br>

<h4>Turnbull, Nancy<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>&quot;I am inspired to paint by the natural world - by changing seasons, 
odd reflections on a wet beach, wild flowers growing in unusual places, soft 
shades of green, lilac clouds, lichen on shore rocks.<br>
 There is always a 
reason for choosing a particular subject; something that stirs the imagination, 
something that not everyone would observe...</p> <br>

<h4>Underhill, Craig<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>A predominant influence in this work is the landscape, but not a static 
landscape, instead a landscape in time; where things grow, the land moves, 
geological deposits are built up and most importantly where humankind has 
intervened and our repetitive, methodic actions have left lasting visual 
effects on the environment...</p> <br>

<h4>Van Der Walt, Clementina<br>

<h4>Varney, Keith<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>I create ceramic vessels and small scale sculptural pieces that explore 
form, line, texture and the interaction of light, shade and colour. Inspiration 
is drawn from the natural world, the material qualities of clay and the 
physicality of the making process itself. Working in porcelain for its purity, 
translucency, and its clear bright colours when glazed...</p> <br>

<h4>Vlassopulos, Tina<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Artist Statement:-<br>
 Tina is a studio potter based in London producing 
one off hand built ceramics.<br>
 ----<br>
 &quot;The pots are all made with an 
eye to the possibility of function, although this is always balanced by the 
sculptural strengths of the forms. They are pots made contemplatively, for 
contemplation...</p> <br>

<h4>Volk, Patricia<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>For the last fifteen years I have been more or less immersed in creating 
heads; flawed heroes, empowered virgins, or pensive deities, icon like but with 
iconoclastic human frailties. I felt they were the ideal vessels for conveying 
humanity through the material, but they were also my comfort zone. Now I've 
made a complete departure...</p> <br>

<h4>Wake , Cat<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Cat creates decorative and functional vessels from pewter, which are 
hand-raised using traditional silversmithing techniques to create the organic 
qualities inherent throughout my work.<br>
<br>
 Her work is influenced by 
natural forms, including acorn cups and seedpods, which are reflected 
throughout her vessels...</p> <br>

<h4>Wale, Peter J<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Peter, born in Worcester is a versatile multi-media painter matching medium 
to subjects - the figure, portraits, boats, harbours, seascapes, caricatures

abstract painting. His connection with the ballet stems from his time as a pit 
musician playing for the shows...</p> <br>

<h4>Walton, Sarah<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>I have worked in saltglaze for more than 25 years. Landscape is a theme in 
my work. I have walked, drawn and painted it since childhood and this lies 
behind the evolution of my Birdbaths, made since 1984.<br>
 Bird Baths, 
Sculptural pieces, Tiles, mugs, beakers, plates and bowls, all in saltglaze, 
comprise my current range of work...</p> <br>

<h4>Ward, Camilla<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>My work is linked to painting. <br>
 I use the ceramic surface as a canvas 
for my response to a literal and abstract, personal landscape. I love the 
spontaneity and mark making quality of clay. I hope to make the work 
approachable and tactile, in opposition to the &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; and 
precious association of fine ceramics. Hence, the tension of a matt exterior 
against the glazed interior. ...</p> <br>

<p>Robin Welch has been a singular figure in British studio ceramics for at 
least forty years. His freely constructed vessels - hand-built and thrown - are

panels...</p> <br>

<h4>Wheeldon, John<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>The last few years have seen him return to using lustre, this time applied 
to a terra sigillata surface, raku fired and smoked. The combination of gold 
and smoked polished terra sigillata is irresistible - a rich sensuous surface.
<br> He feels that above all he is a potter who responds primarily to materials 
and processes...</p> <br>

of working that I strongly identified with, and I felt that I had found my 
creative direction...</p> <br>

<h4>White, Steve<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>A Kandinsky exhibition in London provoked Steve into art. He reacted, as 
many people do when they see abstract art - 'I could do that'. He became a big 
fan of the semi abstract style of artists such as David Hockney, Roy 
Lichtenstein, Fernand Leger, Tom Wesselmann and Bob Kessel.<br>
 After ten 
years perfecting his art Steve stumbled across Reflexionism on a sailing 
holiday in Croatia....</p> <br>

<p>Inspired by the ordinary, my interest is in taking a snapshot of everyday 
urban<br>
 life and preserving the beauty of something that is often 
overlooked, using canvas and paint.<br>

impressionistic to photo-realistic, the latter being the style selected for the 
show in Worcester, in order to most effectively translate that freeze-frame 
moment onto canvas...</p> <br>

<h4>Whitwell, Matthew<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>The images I create are composed from informal and staged photography. The 
limitations of photography in terms of narrative capacity are at the forefront 
of my practice. My work is intent on capturing an unresolved narrative, one 
which permits the viewer to transfer a personal narrative and reflect on the 
still image...</p> <br>

(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>The figures have been developed by also looking back in time to classical

<h4>Wood, Rachel<br>
(view Gallery).</h4> 
<p>Rachel says<br>
 &quot;I love to explore the rhythm and movement of 
throwing clay on a wheel, excited by the freshness and spontaneity of the 
results. My personal intuitive touch is an integral part of my pots. This is 
evident by a wet hand on a soft form fresh off the wheel, through to an 
individual hand or fingerprint emphasised by the glaze...</p> <br>
