(ARA) - The 
holidays are a time for celebrating, reflecting on the past year and exchanging 
gifts with friends and family. However, unique and meaningful ideas can be a 
daunting task. Gifts that keep giving and growing are a perfect solution. 
Plants are not just beautiful, but also cheer up any space and even improve air 
quality in a home or office space.<br>
<br>
When gifting plants:<br>
<br>
Give 
care:<br>
<br>
Always include care instructions for the plant gift. Even the 
most experienced indoor plant grower appreciates a little help. Most live goods 
come with suggested light feeding and watering recommendations. If the plant 
selected does not have these care instructions, ask before leaving the nursery 
so the recipient can keep this lovely gift green. <br>
<br>
Customize the plant 
to the person:<br>
<br>
Flowers, succulents, cacti, tropicals and even bulbs 
can make great presents. The varieties and combinations are as endless as the 
personalities on your gift list. It is important to match the plant to the 
recipient. For instance, a plant needing daily watering would not make a good 
gift for a constant traveler. Instead, give them an interesting cactus or 
succulent, which needs less frequent care. For an artistic friend, try a 
terrarium that can be customized to their tastes. The more sophisticated giftee 
may appreciate a colorful and delicate orchid. For those with asthma or 
allergies, plants like palms, peace lilies and ferns do an excellent job of 
improving air quality and filtering out toxins.<br>
<br>
Containers make a 
difference:<br>
<br>
Those boring, plastic pots that house most plants are not 
very attractive or personal. Pop your plants into colorful ceramic, glass, wood 
or even metal containers for a more interesting and personal touch. Inexpensive 
terra cotta pots can be painted in bright or metallic-colored paint, large 
coffee cups as containers can add a quirky element or baskets can be lined with 
plastic and used to hold small pots. When repotting plants yourself, make sure 
to use a high-quality potting mix such as Miracle-Gro Potting Mix or 
Miracle-Gro Organic Choice Potting Mix. Also, keep in mind that specialty 
plants like cacti, African violets and orchids may perform better in special 
potting mixes. When in doubt, ask the nursery for recommendations. For 
presentation, wrap foil, paper or cellophane around the outside of the 
container and use fabric bows or raffia to add a finishing touch.<br>
<br>

Plants at the party:<br>
<br>
Little gifts from nature go a long way in 
spreading the holiday cheer to friends, family and neighbors. When hosting a 
party, offer little mementos for your guests to take home. Try a small terra 
cotta pot painted gold and planted with rosemary or thyme and tied with a 
lovely ribbon Or, maybe small, colorful pots filled with soil and a bulb to add 
a pop of spring to the winter months. Add a photo of the flower your guest can 
expect and directions onforcing the bulb to the gift tag. Whether paying a call 
on friends or attending a party, host or hostess gifts are another fun way to 
spread holiday cheer. Poinsettia, amaryllis and Christmas cactus are seasonal 
favorites.<br>
<br>
Plants make excellent gifts and will be a reminder of the 
good times you shared. <br>
