<h3>Buying and Cooking With A Slow Cooker</h3> 
<p> Slow cookers are very city kitchen friendly.&nbsp; They're perfect for 
winter meals and useful year-round.&nbsp; If you've never used one, what 
follows is a primer on buying a slow cooker, how to use it, and some of the 
best cookbooks on the subject.</p> 
<p> <br>
Buying A Slow Cooker<br>
<br>
<strong>Rival</strong> is the king of 
slow cookers. While pottery cooking has been around for centuries, Rival seems 
to have set the standard for the electric version -- plus they've successfully 
turned their brand name into mainstream language with the Rival &quot;Crock 
Pot.&quot;<br>
<br>
 While there are about a dozen slow cooker manufacturers, 
Rival is in the business in a serious way and they're the dominant brand. Slow 
cookers can cost as little as about $12 and rise to more than $200 (All-Clad's 
Deluxe Slow Cooker sells at Williams-Sonoma for $249.95).<br>
<br>
 In terms of 
<strong>functionality,</strong> all slow cookers are essentially the same and 
employ the same technology. The difference in price is primarily due to size or 
electric features. For example, the least expensive models are completely 
manual with a knob that simply chooses low, high, or off. Others have an option 
for &quot;warm&quot; after the cooking is done. Many of the newer models, 
including the one I bought, let you set the heat level (low or high) as well as 
a multi-hour timer calibrated at 30-minute intervals. After the time has 
passed, the cooker will automatically shift to &quot;warm&quot; and keep it 
there for up to four hours. And the most costly cookers have extras; All-Clad's 
Deluxe model has an insert made of cast aluminum that can be used on a stove 
top.<br>
<br>
 None of them let you pre-set the start because this would create 
a food hazard with raw food, notably meat, poultry or fish, sitting at room 
temperature and developing bacteria. Slow cookers always require a manual 
start, even if the stop is electronically controlled hours later.<br>
<br>

<strong>Sizes</strong> range from very small, 16-ounce pots that are used as 
warmers, such as for serving a warm dip, to very large 8-quart appliances. 
Two-to-three-quart models are available for smaller households but the most 
popular sizes are five to six quarts. I bought a 5 1/2-quart not because I have 
a big household; I don't. But buying one a quart or so larger didn't seem to 
change the price and I wanted its versatility. Five quarts is big enough to 
hold a rack of ribs, a four-pound pot roast, or a whole chicken. Plus if I'm 
going to use 6 or so hours of electricity to cook something and go through all 
the effort to prep the ingredients, I want to get my money and effort's worth, 
meaning leftovers.<br>
<br>
 The pots come in two <strong>shapes</strong>: 
round or oval. In an oval cooker you can more easily fit a whole chicken or 
odd-shaped pieces of meat like lamb shanks than in a round pot. The cookers 
have two parts -- the removable (and dishwasher proof) interior ceramic pot and 
the outside metal appliance. Once you turn it on, the metal outside gets very 
hot, enough to burn your hand so the pot needs to be placed where children (or 
adults) won't brush against it during these day-long simmerings. Most slow 
cookers also have short electric cords as a safety feature, keeping the pots 
close to the wall.<br>
<br>
 A reader wrote to me how she's used her rice 
cooker as a slow cooker, but my research suggests this will be a frustrating 
substitute because they don't get hot enough; the ideal temperature for cooking 
rice will not get you good results with ingredients like chicken or beef.<br>

<br> The cookers themselves are refreshingly uncomplicated. Plug it in, set at 
high or low, and time the clock.<br>
<br>
A Rival Adventure<br>
<br>
 I chose a 
Rival Crockpot for two reasons: one, they're easy to find and very affordable 
(if I hated cooking with it I didn't want to lose too much of an investment). 
And two, I wanted to work with a brand that had been almost singlehandedly 
responsible for keeping this cooking method in American kitchens. I figured 
they knew what they were doing.<br>
<br>
 Before buying I did lots of market 
research, read tips that were included with the cookbooks I had begun to 
gather, and did the usual asking friends (only one had a slow cooker) and 
scanning Google. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond's web site had a 5 1/2 quart Rival 
Crockpot with a timer and automatic thermostat that would turn to warm when the 
cooking was done. It was very attractive with a stainless steel exterior and 
black ceramic pot. And it was $29. Since I live within walking distance of one 
of their stores I called to see if it was also available there but learned this 
was a web-only deal on a discontinued model. A few mouse clicks and two days 
later I was making my first slow cooked pot roast. Back to that in a moment.<br>
<br> After making three dishes in my very pretty crock pot, I began to notice 
how recipes that were supposed to take six to eight hours on &quot;low&quot; 
were in fact cooking in three and I called Rival for advice. Without much of a 
detour I quickly reached a human being, a lovely woman named &quot;Tanya&quot; 
who patiently listened to my virgin crock pot experiences. After asking me to 
read her a code that was stamped onto the prongs of the pot's electric plug, 
she responded with, &quot;Dear, it sounds like something is wrong. Why don't 
you just let us send you a new one.&quot; It was that simple. No shipping the 
malfunctioning one back. No fussing. No arguments. No paperwork. Tanya guided 
me to a web site that had about 30 Crock Pot models with the instruction to 
choose anything I liked. Five days later UPS delivered me a brand new Crockpot, 
plus it was a newer model!<br>
<br>
 When was the last time you had a customer 
service experience like that?<br>
<br>
The Technique of Slow Cooking<br>
<br>
 
I always considered slow cookers as good for only a few dishes. Chili, soup, 
and maybe pot roast, recipes in which ingredients would just be thrown together 
and essentially abandoned for eight hours.<br>
<br>
 But in fact this is not 
the case. While slow cooking is the direct opposite of 30-minute meals, they 
still require some preparation and some &quot;technique&quot; to get the 
maximum flavor from the slow, moist cooking.<br>
<br>
 So what does the slow 
cooker do that your oven cannot? Well, nothing really. So if we can cook the 
same way with our stoves, why use a slow cooker -- especially in our small city 
kitchens that don't have room for non-essential appliances?<br>
<br>
 Here's 
what I've already come to appreciate about having a slow cooker:<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>While we can use our stovetops and ovens for braising, or a long, slow 
roast at a low temperature, only the slow cooker gives us such gentle heat, 
delivered through convection. The metal casing surrounds the ceramic container 
-- the &quot;crock&quot; -- and the cover keeps the moisture inside the cooker. 
Temperatures are lower than what we usually use in our ovens; about 185&deg; F 
to 200&deg; F when low, and 250&deg; F to 300&deg; F at high.</li> 
<li>I can cook a slow braise without heating up my entire apartment from 
having the oven on for three hours. Yes, the cooker will be on for six or seven 
hours (three or four if I set it to high) but it's not blasting heat as my oven 
does.</li> 
<li>Because the heat is so gentle, you can cook for hours without overcooking.
</li> 
<li>It gives me a kind of second oven. I can be cooking a stew in the slow 
cooker while using my oven to bake a dessert or roast vegetables.</li> 
<li>If I'm entertaining and making a multi-course meal, the slow cooker lets 
me keep food warm when I've made it in advance -- at a perfect temperature that 
doesn't continue to cook it. For example, if I'm going to serve a soup or 
little meatballs in sauce, I can plug the slow cooker in anywhere and keep 
things warm while freeing up my stovetop to finish cooking the meal.</li> 
<li>It's best for inexpensive cuts of meat, such as chicken thighs, chuck 
roasts, pork shoulder, lamb shanks, and sturdier vegetables like beets and 
potatoes that benefit from long, slow cooking. If you're more carefully 
managing your food budget, buying cheaper cuts of meat and poultry and cooking 
them in a slow cooker can mean interesting flavors and satisfying meals at a 
lower cost.</li> 
<li>It's unexpectedly well suited for cooking dishes that have far more 
complexity than chili. For example, it's perfect for rice pudding, cassoulet, 
pulled pork, or tagines (the tagine's distinctive hat-shaped pot is intended to 
create and return moisture to what's being cooked, exactly what a slow cooker 
does). And this coming summer, when the Greenmarkets are full of local, 
in-season, big flavor-low cost fruits, I'm going to use it to make jams and 
preserves.</li> </ul> 
<p> <br>
 What can't a slow cooker do? You can't brown in one. As Andrew 
Schloss, author of the wonderful<em>Art of the Slow Cooker,</em> wrote, 
&quot;In cooking, brown is not just a color. It is a flavor&hellip;.&quot; That 
is why most slow cooker recipes begin with browning in a skillet plus 
pre-cooking some of the ingredients that will develop better flavor if you get 
them a head start with more heat. Like onions and garlic, or blooming spices on 
the stove top first. This pre-cooking also helps kill any bacteria that may be 
on the surface of the food.<br>
<br>
 If you want to start a recipe in the 
morning and leave it cooking while you head off to work for 8 or so hours, you 
still have to do some cooking and prepping to get it going. This takes a bit of 
time. And only you can decide if browning meat and slicing onions is something 
you can face at 7:00 a.m.<br>
<br>
Slow Cooker Tips<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>This may be self-evident but put the bigger ingredients or the items that 
you think will take longer to cook (that big piece of chuck versus the sliced 
carrots) on the bottom and the quicker cooking foods on top.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t preheat the pot. Add the ingredients to the cold pot, some of 
which will be partially cooked or browned, and then turn it on, cover it, and 
set the timer.</li> 
<li>Soon after you turn on the cooker you'll see the glass cover will steam 
up. This condensation is a sign that it's working right.</li> 
<li>Some say you should resist lifting the lid because this causes an 
immediate drop off in temperature, defeating the machine's slow, steady, low 
heat cooking. But I was learning and couldn't resist peeking and saw that the 
cooker got quickly back to its pre-lifted-lid state. Besides, lifting the lid 
is how I figured out my machine was cooking too fast. Giving the contents a bit 
of a stir or using tongs to move the larger ingredients around is also a good 
idea since electric devices sometimes have hot spots and one side of your pot 
may cook a bit hotter than the other.</li> 
<li>If you want to use a slow cooker in its most iconic way -- meaning setting 
it before you leave for work so that you can come home to a pot of white bean 
and lamb stew -- practice a few times first by making recipes and watching the 
progress closely while you're still at home. That way you can confirm your slow 
cooker is functioning correctly.</li> 
<li>Don't fill a slow cooker to the top. Every cookbook I read said that 
you'll get the best results when it's filled one-third to three-quarters. Fill 
it less and things may burn; overfill it and everything may not completely cook.
</li> </ul> 
<p> <br>
Slow Cooking Cookbooks<br>
<br>
 Being a complete slow cooker novice, 
I needed help. I began at the major recipe web sites and found that AllRecipes 
was particularly useful, probably because this database is filled with recipes 
submitted by home cooks, especially ones from across the heartland where slow 
cookers aren't as exotic as they are in city kitchens. It has an entire special 
slow cooker section, complete with tips.<br>
<br>
 But I wanted to learn from 
chefs and food writers who had developed some practice and expertise in 
adapting complex recipes to be made in slow cookers. I worked with six slow 
cooker cookbooks. They're all different but each is outstanding:<br>
<br>

<strong><em>Art of the Slow Cooker</em></strong> (Chronicle Books, paperback, 
color photos, $24.95) by Andrew Schloss may have been my favorite because it 
inspired me and as a beginner, it coached me with a very supportive voice. With 
very appealing photography by Yvonne Duivenvoorden, it has an excellent range 
of recipes and is full of helpful advice, tips and an extremely useful 
introduction with basic information about buying a slow cooker. A favorite 
feature is a chart that details the basic preparation, precooking and slow cook 
time (both at low and high) for about 50 mainstream ingredients.<br>
<br>
 Its 
80 recipes are very appealing. For example, &quot;Corn Chowder with 
Jalape&ntilde;o,&quot; &quot;Barbecued Pork Ribs,&quot; &quot;Vegetable 
Tagine,&quot; &quot;Slow-Roasted Beets with Walnut Gremolata,&quot; and 
&quot;Chocolate Pudding Cake.&quot;&nbsp; We've been given the generous 
permission to reprint both the chowder and tagine recipes.</p> 
<p> <em><strong>Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook</strong></em> (Harvard 
Common Press, paperback, no photographs, $18.95) by Beth Hensperger and Julie 
Kaufmann and<em><strong>Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Recipes for Two</strong>
</em> (Harvard Common Press, paperback, no photographs, $12.95) by Beth 
Hensperger are both excellent choices for their recipe diversity and also the 
tips and instructions throughout the books. I particularly like how Beth 
Hensperger's recipes are healthy and in these two volumes, many have 
international flavor and inspiration.<br>
<br>
 The first book has 350 recipes, 
including &quot;Our Best Pot Roast with Roots,&quot; the very first recipe I 
made in my new Crock Pot. It was motivating to have my premiere dish be such a 
success. It was as good a pot roast as I've ever made. I also liked their 
&quot;Italian White Beans with Pancetta,&quot; a recipe that confirmed how 
dried beans are a perfect match for slow cookers. The publisher has been 
generous in giving us permission to reprint both recipes.&nbsp; The second 
volume was written specifically for home cooks with smaller households using 
smaller cookers. It has some very appealing recipes, like &quot;Chipotle Black 
Bean Vegetable Soup,&quot; 10 different chilies, and &quot;Pork Tenderloin with 
Rhubarb,&quot; all made in a smaller cooker, usually one that has a 
one-and-a-half to three-quart capacity.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>The $7 A Meal Slow 
Cooker Cookbook</strong></em>by Linda Larsen (Adams Media, paperback, no 
photographs, $9.95) has 301 recipes and was written by a &quot;Pillsbury 
Bake-Off recipe tester.&quot; These recipes sometimes use processed ingredients 
like canned soups, jarred salsa and frozen French fry potatoes. But 
nonetheless, the recipes are mostly easy, many are appealing, and once you get 
the hang of your cooker, you can easily make fresh substitutions for the canned 
or frozen stuff. Recipes include &quot;Beef With Broccoli,&quot; &quot;Chicken 
Wheatberry Casserole,&quot; and &quot;Vegetable Barley Stew.&quot; I like how 
each recipe is noted with the approximate price to make the dish, plus 
nutritional details on calories, fat, sodium, carbohydrates and protein.<br>

<br> <strong><em>The Gourmet Slow Cooker </em></strong>and <em><strong>The 
Gourmet Slow Cooker Volume II (</strong></em>Ten Speed Press, paperback, color 
photographs, $18.95 each) are by Lynn Alley and these are the most elegant of 
the cookbooks I worked with. The first is subtitled, &quot;Simple and 
Sophisticated Meals from Around the World&quot; and Volume II is &quot;Regional 
Comfort Food Classics.&quot;<br>
<br>
 These volumes inspired me to cook the 
more complex and sophisticated recipes and not fall back to easy stews or 
soups. My one squabble with both of Ms. Alley's books is her practice of 
including whole spices in their un-ground form. For example, recipes will call 
for a stick of cinnamon that you're then instructed to grind to a powder. It's 
not clear if it's a big stick or a little stick and if you don't have a spice 
grinder, you're left to your own calculation as to how to substitute powdered 
cinnamon. Same for every other spice -- cumin seed, fennel seed, whole cloves, 
etc. To be fair to Ms. Alley, this kind of commitment to best ingredients is 
emblematic of her refined and creative use of the slow cooker. Just anticipate 
that you'll either need to get a spice grinder to be prepared to use your best 
judgment on how to make substitutions. Her recipes include &quot;Chicken and 
Dumplings,&quot; &quot;Artichoke Risotto,&quot; &quot;San Francisco 
Cioppino,&quot; and &quot;New England Baked Beans.&quot;<br>
<br>
Adding French 
Technique to A Slow Cooker<br>
<br>
 So much of the appeal of slow cooking is 
its simplicity. But you may still be disappointed with the result if too many 
corners are cut. My primary complaint during this maiden voyage was how every 
cookbook used the addition of flour as a way to create sauces and gravies. In 
each of these six cookbooks, nearly every recipe for a stew or braise says to 
toss the meat or poultry in flour before browning, sometimes adding even more 
flour to the mixture before the slow cooking begins. One veal stew recipe I 
tried called for a half-cup of flour for about 3 pounds of veal. That's a lot 
of flour. Regardless of the meat or poultry and no matter how much flour was 
used, every time I tried this method the result was unpleasantly gummy.<br>
<br>
 I experimented and instead of using the authors' coat-with-flour-at-the-start 
method, I used a technique I learned in culinary school that will let you get 
that gravy you want, but without the gumminess or lumps. It may sound fancy but 
in fact is very easy -- plus it lets you control the result.<br>
<br>
 The 
technique is called<em>beurre mani&eacute;</em> and here's how it works: </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Follow your recipe to make your stew or pot roast or tagine in your slow 
cooker but completely omit any flour.</li> 
<li>The cooking liquid, whether it's added stock, wine, water or just the 
juices from the meat, will be clearer and broth-like throughout the cooking 
because you'll have eliminated the flour.</li> 
<li>When the dish is finished cooking, take the meat and any big ingredients 
out of the pot, and leaving the cover off, turn the heat up high to make the 
liquid come to a gentle boil.</li> 
<li>In a separate little bowl combine equal amounts of flour and unsalted 
butter; two tablespoons of each is a good amount. Use your fingers to rub the 
flour and butter together to make a crumbly paste-like mixture (you can do this 
ahead of time and keep it chilled).</li> 
<li>When the liquid in the slow cooker is bubbling, start adding bits of the 
paste, about a teaspoon at a time, and using a whisk or wooden spoon, stir 
rigorously so that the flour/butter paste dissolves into the liquid. The butter 
melts and the flour gets added to the liquid without any lumps. [Remember this 
method when you want to make Thanksgiving gravy with turkey stock.]</li> 
<li>Keep adding the <em>beurre mani&eacute;</em> paste into the hot liquid 
until it develops the gravy-like appearance that you want. Want it thicker? Add 
more. It won't turn into a custard or get overly thick but it will develop that 
gravy-like viscosity. Add the other ingredients back into the pot to stay warm 
until serving.</li> </ol> 
<p> <br>
 With this method the foods that have cooked in the slow cooker will 
not have become coated in a pasty surface and yet you will transform a broth 
into a sauce, making it more appealing but retaining a clearer yet still rich 
taste.<br>
<br>
 So add a little French technique to the all American slow 
cooker. It's another way to explore how to fit cooking into your every day life 
while still enjoying special and satisfying meals.</p> &nbsp; <br>
