<h2>Soil Mix and Containers<br>
 for Growing Healthy Plumeria</h2> <br>

<p>Plumeria have become quite popular as container plants, especially for 
those of us living in climates where it is necessary to move plants to protect 
from freezing winter weather. To be successful at maintaining plant health and 
vigor, we must choose the correct type and size container and fill with an 
equally well selected soil mix.</p> 
<p><strong>Container Type</strong><br>
 There are many types of pots or 
containers available today ranging from ceramic to plastic. While the ceramic 
and clay pots are generally more decorative than black plastic nursery cans, 
they may not be the most ideal. I use the rigid variety of black plastic 
nursery containers for all of my plumeria. These containers have at least 4 
good drainage holes towards the bottom to allow for great drainage. They come 
in many sizes; 1 gallon, 2 gal., 3 gal., 5 gal. etc... Also, they are cheap!! 
Salt buildup is not a problem as with standard clay pots. The black plastic 
nursery containers are much less likely to develop a drainage problem than pots 
with only one drainage hole in the bottom center. Roots can grow freely through 
the many drainage holes without much risk of stopping drainage. In clay pots 
with only one drain, a tap root can fill the hole and stop drainage. If this 
problem were to go undetected during a wet season or after heavy watering, the 
Plumeria roots could be severely damaged or killed. It is therefore necessary 
to choose your containers carefully for the plant it will contain.</p> 
<p><strong>Container Size</strong><br>
 Choosing the correct container for 
your Plumeria may be one of the most important factors in determining how well 
it will perform for you. Experience has shown that Plumeria need ample root 
room while actively growing. Those grown in open ground always perform and 
bloom better than those held captive in small pots. A general rule of thumb is 
to allow 1 gallon pot size for each foot of plumeria branch / trunk length. By 
choosing a large enough pot, you allow more room for root growth which in turn 
leads to better moisture and nutrient uptake by the plant.</p> 
<p><strong>Plumeria Potting Soil Mix</strong><br>
 Plumeria are heavy feeders 
and appear to do well in fertile well draining soil. A good soil mix is one 
that allows water to soak the rootball quickly. While retaining plenty of 
moisture, it must allow excess water to drain within a few minutes. The good 
soil mix should contain plenty of nutrients to encourage growth and blossoms on 
plumeria also. One soil mix that works well is as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 part 1/4 inch bark mulch (Professional planting mix) </li> 
<li>1 part good potting soil </li> 
<li>1 part calcined clay, or pumice (or Soil Pro&reg; 400, or perlite) </li> 
<li>1 part sheep manure (or cow manure) </li> 
<li>1 part sharp sand </li> 
<li>1/6 part bone meal or superphosphate (or slow release high P plant food) 
</li> </ul> 
<p>The calcined clay I referred to looks more like Kitty Litter and may be the 
same stuff. It is essentially a granular product derived from sintering clay at 
a temperature high enough to melt the individual particles together. The 
product is then ground and screened into various size ranges. This material can 
be found as a product called Soil Pro&reg; 400 at nurseries in Houston. I have 
found it (slightly less fused) as oil dry at our local Hi-Lo Auto Parts Store. 
If this is not available, then either pumice (1/8 to 1/4 inch particles) or 
coarse perlite can be used. I think pumice is readily available in garden 
centers in the California area. Actually, Pumice might be my first choice if it 
were available in Houston. The purpose of this additive is to keep the soil 
more porous so that water drains good. Also, the porous nature of the particles 
will help retain water and nutrients for the plant roots to absorb and allow 
oxygen to percolate through the root zone. If sheep manure is not available, I 
suggest composted cow (or steer) manure as the second choice. I do not have 
experience with chicken manure, but if it is well composted, it should work as 
well. The idea is to get a slow release natural organic fertilizer into the 
soil mix.</p> 
<p>Other additives can be used to round out this mix such as 1 part perlite 
and 1 part peat moss. A handful or two of Osmocote&reg; with equal N-P-K 
numbers (or any another slow-release fertilizer) can be added to ensure slow 
feeding over an extended period of time. This soil mixture should also be heavy 
enough to help keep potted plants upright in a moderate breeze.</p> <br>
