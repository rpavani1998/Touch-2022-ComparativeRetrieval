<pre> NOTE: CERTAIN MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED FROM THIS AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO 
A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT UNDER RULE 24B-2. THE LOCATIONS OF THESE 
OMISSIONS ARE INDICATED THROUGHOUT THE AGREEMENT BY THE FOLLOWING MARKINGS: [ *

by and between MSO IP HOLDINGS, INC., a California corporation, with its 
principal place of business at 11100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 600, Los

corporation, with its principal place of business at 3100 West Big Beaver Road, 
Troy, Michigan 48084 (&quot;Kmart&quot;). WHEREAS, MSO and Kmart have 
previously entered into an agreement, dated January 28, 1997 (the &quot;Bed and 
Bath Agreement&quot;), pursuant to which Kmart and MSO, among other things, 
merchandise and develop certain home products; WHEREAS, MSO and Kmart have 
previously entered into an agreement, dated June 1, 1998 (the &quot;Garden 
Agreement&quot;), pursuant to which Kmart and MSO, among other things, 
merchandise and develop certain garden products; WHEREAS, MSO and Kmart have 
previously entered into an agreement, dated April 21, 1999 (the 
&quot;Housewares Agreement,&quot; and together with the Bed and Bath Agreement 
and the Garden Agreement, the &quot;Prior Agreements&quot;), pursuant to which 
Kmart and MSO, among other things, merchandise and develop certain housewares 
products; WHEREAS, Kmart and MSO have determined to terminate the Prior 
Agreements and enter into this Agreement, which shall set forth revised terms 
and conditions governing the relationship between the parties and shall, as of 
August 1, 2001, supersede the Prior Agreements in every way (except for 
obligations relating to payment of royalties for periods prior to August 1, 
2001); NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration the sufficiency of 
which is hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto, the parties hereto hereby 
agree as follows: I. Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, MSO licenses to Kmart the limited right in the Territory (as defined 
below) to utilize the trademark MARTHA STEWART EVERYDAY(TM) and variations and 
stylized forms thereof designated by MSO (the &quot;Trademark&quot;), together 
with the name, likeness, voice and signature of Martha Stewart (in each case 
solely in connection with the Trademark) (the &quot;Stewart Property&quot;), 
and the designs and other intellectual property incorporated in the Licensed 
Products (as defined below) (the &quot;Product Designs,&quot; and together with 
the Stewart Property and the Trademark, the &quot;Licensed Property&quot;), all 
of which shall be approved by MSO in the manner set forth herein, solely in 
connection with (i) the manufacture of Licensed Products, (ii) the distribution 
of Licensed Products to, and retail sale of Licensed Products by, Kmart's Kmart 
stores in the Territory, and (iii) the manufacture and exploitation of the 
Materials (as defined in Section VI(1)) in connection with Kmart's sales of 
Licensed Products through its Kmart stores. Any sale or other exploitation 
&lt;PAGE&gt; 2 of the Licensed Products or use of the Licensed Property in a 
manner not explicitly permitted hereunder shall be deemed a material breach of 
this Agreement. &quot;Licensed Products&quot; shall mean the Home Products (as 
defined below), the Garden Products (as defined below), the Housewares Products 
(as defined below), the Seasonal Products (as defined below) and the Additional 
Products (as defined in Section XVII). The &quot;Home Products&quot; shall mean 
those products developed and merchandised by Kmart and MSO pursuant to the 
terms of this Agreement and/or the Bed and Bath Agreement in the product 
categories set forth on Schedule I(a) hereto. The &quot;Garden Products&quot; 
shall mean those products developed and merchandised by Kmart and MSO pursuant 
to the terms of this Agreement and/or the Garden Agreement in the product 
categories set forth on Schedule I(b) hereto. The &quot;Housewares 
Products&quot; shall mean those products developed and merchandised by Kmart 
and MSO pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and/or the Housewares Agreement 
in the product categories set forth on Schedule I(c) hereto. The &quot;Seasonal 
Products&quot; shall mean those products developed and merchandised by Kmart 
and MSO pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in the product categories set 
forth on Schedule I(d) hereto. &quot;Product Category&quot; shall mean a broad 
category of Licensed Product (1) comprising narrower categories of product 
associated by a common theme, and (2) which Kmart and MSO consider a cohesive 
program (e.g. Home Products, Garden Products, etc.). &quot;Initial 
Products&quot; shall mean the Home Products, the Garden Products, the 
Housewares Products and the Seasonal Products. &quot;Territory&quot; shall mean 
the United States of America and its territories, including, Puerto Rico, Guam, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean. Additionally, if Kmart opens 
Kmart stores in additional small countries it may request of MSO for such 
country to be added to the definition of the Territory, which request MSO shall 
generally approve so long as (x) MSO (or its affiliate) is not already actively 
marketing (either directly or through third parties) products and/or services 
in such country, (y) MSO (or its affiliate) does not have plans to begin to 
market (either directly or through third parties) products and/or services in 
such country in the foreseeable future, and (z) MSO has no other compelling 
reason why adding such country to the Territory would be detrimental to MSO's 
(or its affiliate's) business. II. Exclusivity. (1) MSO warrants and agrees 
that the license of the Licensed Property contained herein is exclusive to 
Kmart in Exclusive Stores (as hereafter defined) in the Territory during the 
Term in connection with the promotion, advertising, manufacture, distribution 
and sale of any products which are Licensed Products. &quot;Exclusive 
Stores&quot; shall mean (i) the retail store outlets in the discount store 
channel of distribution which includes only Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Target, J.C. 
Penney, Montgomery Ward, Venture, Bradlees, Kohl's, Mervyn's, Meijer, Fred 
Meyer, Shopko, Costco and Hill's and similar national or regional discount 
stores which are not in business as of the date hereof but which may come into 
existence in the future during the Term, provided that Kmart provides MSO with 
written notice of its desire to include such newly-existing stores within the 
definition of Exclusive Stores within 60 days of the initial opening of any 
such store and MSO reasonably agrees that such store should be so included, and 
(ii) the retail store outlets of Sears, Lowe's, Home Depot, HQ, Builder's 
Square and Hechinger's. (2) MSO may use or permit others to use the Licensed 
Property on products which are of the same product type as Licensed Products 
and which are of a higher quality and intended by MSO to be sold at a higher 
price point than the Licensed Products sold by Kmart provided, however, that 
such products are sold by such licensee other than through Exclusive Stores. 2 
&lt;PAGE&gt; 3 (3) In the event MSO wishes to develop, merchandise, and sell 
products in cooperation with Kmart in Product Categories other than those of 
the Initial Products, MSO shall provide Kmart written notice describing such 
category and MSO's desire to work with Kmart in connection therewith. Promptly 
thereafter, representatives of Kmart and MSO shall cooperate in good faith to 
agree upon appropriate Sales projections for such Product Category, a schedule 
for development and launch of the Licensed Products relating thereto, and other 
pertinent factors relating to the Program. Upon reaching agreement on these 
elements, MSO and Kmart shall enter into an addendum to this Agreement relating 
to such Product Category and setting forth all relevant information necessary 
to incorporate such Product Category into this Agreement. Royalty rates for 
such Product Categories shall be the same as royalty rates otherwise applicable 
hereunder and Minimum Royalty Amounts shall be [ * * * ] of agreed upon 
projections for Sales of such Licensed Products. MSO may not enter into any 
agreement with any Exclusive Store for the sale of Martha Stewart branded 
products in any of the Product Categories set forth on Schedule II(3) hereto 
unless agreement has not been reached with respect to projections, development 
and launch schedule for the Licensed Products in such Product Category within 
90 days of the giving of notice by MSO hereunder, provided that if Kmart is 
still cooperating with MSO in good faith to come to such agreement this period 
will be extended for an additional 30 days. Any Licensed Products developed 
pursuant to this Section II(3) shall be &quot;Additional Products.&quot; 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall MSO enter into any agreements 
with Target, Wal-mart, Kohl's, J.C. Penny's, and Sears in connection with the 
manufacture, distribution or sale at such stores of products in the categories 
of apparel, electronics, sporting goods, automotive care, cameras or jewelry. 
III. Restrictions on Use. Kmart agrees that all use of the Licensed Property by 
Kmart shall be in the form and manner as is approved by MSO, which approval 
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and there will appear on all 
Licensed Products and their tags, labels, containers, packaging and the like, 
such legends, markings and notices as may be reasonably deemed necessary by MSO 
for protection under trademark, copyright or other applicable laws. IV. 
Royalties. Kmart shall pay to MSO in the manner described in Section V below 
royalties based on Sales (as defined below) at the royalty rates set forth on 
Schedule IV hereto. &quot;Sales&quot; for a particular period shall mean the 
aggregate retail sale prices charged by Kmart for Licensed Products sold during 
such period, net any amounts actually refunded by Kmart to customers on account 
of returns of Licensed Products during such period. V. Payments. (1) Kmart 
shall deliver royalty reports to MSO within thirty (30) days following the end 
of each Kmart fiscal quarter (the &quot;Quarterly Reports&quot;). Each 
Quarterly Report shall be certified as accurate by an authorized Kmart officer 
and shall set forth the Sales during such quarter by Product Category and SKU, 
as well as the amount of royalties payable with respect thereto. In addition to 
the Quarterly Reports, Kmart shall deliver non-binding (but based on Kmart's 
then current knowledge), interim reports containing the same sales information 
on a monthly basis, consistent with Kmart's practice under the Prior Agreements 
since 1998. Additionally, Kmart shall continue to work to provide MSO with 
electronic access to current financial information relating to Sales via the 
workbench system, any successor system and any supplemental systems necessary 
to provide MSO such access. 3 &lt;PAGE&gt; 4 (2) When Kmart delivers the 
Quarterly Reports to MSO, Kmart shall also pay to MSO the royalties due and 
owing for the corresponding quarter. These payments shall be made by wire 
transfer to a bank account designated by MSO unless it is not practicable for 
Kmart to utilize such method, in which event payment shall be made by check to 
MSO. Additionally, Schedule V(2) hereto sets forth certain guaranteed royalty 
amounts as of each January 31 of the Term commencing on January 31, 2002 
(&quot;Minimum Royalty Amounts&quot;) by Product Category and in the aggregate 
which may give rise to increases in royalty payments otherwise payable. 
Specifically, the royalty payable in connection with each quarter ending 
January 31 shall be increased by the aggregate Category Shortfalls, if any, and 
by the Aggregate Shortfall, if any, for such January 31. A &quot;Category 
Shortfall&quot; shall mean, for any Product Category and any January 31, the 
excess, if any, of the Minimum Royalty Amount for such Product Category and 
such January 31 over the amount of royalties paid and/or payable to MSO on 
account of Sales relating to such Product Category that occurred during the 
twelve-month period ending on such January 31. An &quot;Aggregate 
Shortfall&quot; for any January 31 shall mean the excess, if any, of the 
aggregate Minimum Royalty Amount relating to such January 31, over the amount 
of royalties paid and/or payable to MSO on account of Sales of the Initial 
Products that occurred during the twelve-month period ending on such January 
31. (3) Kmart shall maintain complete and accurate records of the Sales, 
royalty computations, royalty reports and amounts spent on advertising and 
shall, upon reasonable request, make such records and all other documents and 
materials in the possession or control of Kmart and reasonably required to 
confirm Kmart's satisfaction of its obligations under this Agreement and the 
Prior Agreements available to MSO or its duly authorized representatives, 
during usual business hours at Kmart International Headquarters in Troy, 
Michigan, for the duration of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, and 
to make extracts therefrom at its sole expense. All such records and documents 
shall be deemed Information under Section XXV hereof. In the event any audit 
reveals that Kmart has underpaid MSO pursuant to this Agreement and/or any of 
the Prior Agreements, Kmart shall promptly pay MSO the aggregate difference 
between what MSO should have been paid, and what MSO was paid, plus interest on 
such amount at an annual rate of 8%, compounded semi-annually. Moreover, in the 
event the amount of any such underpayment equals or exceeds two and one-half 
percent (2.5%) of the amounts actually paid to MSO during the period with 
respect to which the audit was conducted, Kmart shall bear MSO's reasonable 
costs of the audit, including, without limitation, any amounts payable to MSO's 
outside auditors in connection therewith. VI. Licensed Product Design, 
Consultation, Quality, Schedules, Approvals, and Expenses. (1) The parties 
recognize that the name Martha Stewart has valuable goodwill with the consuming 
public, and that Martha Stewart (&quot;Stewart&quot;) is recognized as an 
authority on quality and style in the area of domestic products and related 
activities. It is an objective of this Agreement that MSO, Kmart, and Kmart's 
vendors of Licensed Products establish a broad spectrum of Licensed Products 
with respect to quality and design consistent with Stewart's image and Kmart's 
pricing philosophy. The parties agree that as an integral part of this 
Agreement, MSO shall direct Kmart and Kmart's vendors of Licensed Products in 
the establishment of the Strategic Direction (as defined below) of the initial 
line and subsequent evolutionary lines (and all changes therein) of merchandise 
comprising each Product Category. As used herein the &quot;Strategic 
Direction&quot; shall include development of all aspects of the Licensed 
Products and the promotion thereof including, without limitation, (A) concepts, 
designs, and product selection, (B) marketing support, and (C) packages, 
labels, hang tags, signage, other 4 &lt;PAGE&gt; 5 consumer facings and 
advertising and promotional materials to be used in connection with the 
Licensed Products (materials in this sub-clause (C), whether developed under 
this Agreement or a Prior Agreement, the &quot;Materials&quot;) . The Strategic 
Direction with respect to each Product Category shall be developed and modified 
as follows: (i) Approximately eighteen months prior to the scheduled store 
implementation of each transition of Licensed Products or at such time as may 
be mutually agreed upon, MSO and Kmart shall meet with respect to such 
products. At such meetings, Kmart shall be responsible, in consultation with 
MSO, for proposing a merchandise plan (including selected vendors and planned 
linear footage) and time and action calendars for the relevant Licensed 
Products as well as related packaging/display requirements. MSO shall review 
the foregoing and shall work with Kmart to finalize the same. (ii) MSO shall 
then present Kmart with product and packaging design concepts. Kmart shall 
review such concepts and shall work with MSO to finalize the same. After the 
concepts have been finalized, MSO shall deliver to Kmart and the relevant 
vendors Licensed Product designs, each with a specific Martha Stewart Everyday 
design number, according to the approved time and action calendars. Kmart and 
the relevant vendors shall then review the product designs for price point, 
delivery and other pertinent merchandise needs and Kmart quality control shall 
review all designs to ensure that they meet or exceed industry standards. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any vendor receiving any designs or 
other proprietary or confidential information, such vendor must enter into an 
agreement (the &quot;Vendor Agreement&quot;) in substantially the form set 
forth on Schedule VI(1)(ii) hereof regarding the confidentiality and 
proprietary nature of certain information, designs and materials to which the 
vendors shall have access. MSO and Kmart shall cooperate to cause all vendors 
to enter into the Vendor Agreement. (iii) Kmart and the relevant vendors shall 
determine all package, display and label requirements, both legal and 
otherwise, and forward the related specifications and schedules to MSO. MSO 
shall then direct the creative look of all packaging, display and labels for 
the Licensed Products. (iv) As Licensed Products are developed by vendors based 
on MSO's approved design concepts, MSO shall review such development and submit 
comments and direction to Kmart and the vendors. When samples of each Licensed 
Product are completed, such samples shall be reviewed by Kmart and MSO. All 
samples shall be reviewed by Kmart and MSO prior to comments being given to the 
vendors and shall be tested for quality by Kmart. Both Kmart and MSO must 
approve a sample before it can be manufactured for sale. Kmart shall give such 
approvals based upon its merchandise needs and on the results of its quality 
testing and MSO shall give its approvals based upon the design concepts it 
submitted to Kmart and MSO's brand objectives (including quality). (v) Kmart 
shall monitor the packaging and display development to insure schedules for all 
vendors are being met. MSO shall monitor the packaging and display development 
to coordinate the design and art direction needs of all Licensed Products being 
packaged and displayed. Both Kmart and MSO must approve all packaging and 
displays before they can be used in connection with the Licensed Products. 
Kmart shall 5 &lt;PAGE&gt; 6 give such approvals based upon its merchandise 
needs and MSO shall give such approvals based upon the design concepts it 
submitted to Kmart and MSO's brand objectives (including quality). (vi) The 
activities set forth in this Section VI(1) shall be conducted in a manner 
generally consistent with past practice under the Prior Agreements as of the 
date hereof. (2) Kmart agrees that each Licensed Product sold by it pursuant to 
this Agreement, and the Materials utilized in connection therewith, shall 
conform to the specifications developed by MSO pursuant to Section VI(1) hereof 
(or under a Prior Agreement) and shall be of a quality equal to or exceeding 
the samples of such Licensed Product approved by MSO pursuant to Section VI(1) 
hereof (or a Prior Agreement). Promptly following execution of this Agreement, 
MSO and Kmart shall develop and implement a mutually agreeable program for (i) 
reviewing and testing the quality, safety and propriety for intended use of 
samples of Licensed Products prior to the time at which they are approved for 
mass manufacture and sale, and (ii) for monitoring quality and safety on a 
continuing basis to make sure that the factory runs of each Licensed Product 
are consistent with the initially approved samples. The costs of this program 
shall be the responsibility of Kmart. This program shall include vigorous 
testing of Licensed Products for wear and tear, maintenance, use and other 
appropriate elements to be determined by the parties. The program shall be 
primarily implemented by Kmart but shall involve MSO personnel as the parties 
deem appropriate. (3) Upon receipt of a notice from MSO pursuant to this 
Agreement setting forth any quality deficiencies prohibited by this Agreement, 
or upon Kmart's discovery of any such deficiencies, Kmart and/or Kmart's 
vendors of the Licensed Products containing such deficiencies shall remedy such 
deficiencies prior to the sale of the deficient Licensed Products or, at their 
option, dispose of such off-quality merchandise through other outlets. Whenever 
such merchandise is sold as aforesaid, no use of or reference to the name 
Martha Stewart or any Licensed Property shall be used in connection with any 
advertising, publicity, labeling, wrapping or packaging with respect to any 
such sales. In accordance with the practice in the trade, Kmart's vendors of 
Licensed Products shall notify their customers to assure compliance by them 
with the requirements of the preceding sentence. Kmart and its vendors of 
Licensed Products shall be deemed to have met this obligation by the removal of 
all labels, tags and marks which would identify the goods as Martha Stewart 
merchandise and by placing the following legend on all purchaser's invoices for 
such goods and by enforcing the terms of such legend if, in the event of 
non-compliance and following consultation with MSO, MSO and Kmart deem it 
appropriate for brand protection: &quot;Purchaser agrees that it will not use 
the name `Martha Stewart' or the legend `designed by Martha Stewart' or any 
other phrase or statement using the name `Martha Stewart' on any advertising, 
publicity, labeling, wrapping or packaging with respect to the merchandise 
listed hereon.&quot; In the event certain Licensed Products must be disposed of 
pursuant to this Section VI(3) and such products have the Trademark or some 
derivation thereof embedded in the product (e.g. a stamp or mold), Kmart and 
MSO agree to cooperate in good faith to determine a manner in which such 
Licensed Products can be disposed of that is mutually beneficial and minimizes 
any potential impact to the Sales and brand image of the Licensed Products. 6 
&lt;PAGE&gt; 7 (4) Kmart shall select its vendors of Licensed Products pursuant 
to the Kmart Quality Standards, Policies and Procedures set forth on Schedule 
VI(4) hereto. (5) MSO and Kmart each agree to exercise their respective rights 
of approval hereunder in a reasonable and timely manner, consistent with any 
agreed upon time schedules and the established Strategic Direction. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no decision by Kmart to refuse to offer for sale 
a particular product that MSO desires to have manufactured for sale shall be 
considered unreasonable, unless such refusal is made for purposes of 
frustrating the purposes of this Agreement. Kmart shall designate one 
individual authorized to exercise its approval rights hereunder and to be the 
liaison between Kmart and MSO. (6) Except as set forth in Section VIII(2) or as 
otherwise explicitly stated herein or agreed upon by Kmart, MSO shall be 
responsible for the costs of its personnel in connection with its services and 
activities hereunder (including, without limitation, its services and 
activities under Section VI (1)) (the &quot;MSO Costs&quot;). Kmart shall bear 
all its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, as well as all 
other costs incurred in connection with the sourcing, design, manufacturing, 
distribution, marketing, advertising and sale of the Licensed Products and the 
Materials, including, without limitation, all photography and production costs 
relating to the Materials. In connection with all still photography shoots, MSO 
shall continue to conduct such shoots, to invoice Kmart therefor and to pay all 
relevant third party costs (including photography costs) from such invoiced 
amounts, provided that budgets for such shoots will be determined in advance by 
MSO and Kmart. (7) In furtherance of the valuable goodwill that Martha Stewart 
products carry with the consuming public, Kmart agrees that it shall cause 
Kmart store employees in every Kmart store to dedicate adequate and substantial 
time to (i) replenishing the shelves that display Licensed Products, (ii) 
monitoring store inventory levels of Licensed Products (including, without 
limitation, using reasonable efforts to increase inventory levels in 
anticipation of sale events, and generally maintaining inventory levels 
sufficient to meet demand), (iii) ensuring that the areas in which the Licensed 
Products are sold are clean, and (v) forwarding any Licensed Products which are 
returned to the relevant Kmart store for reasons of defect to a Kmart quality 
assurance representative. (8) Kmart and MSO agree that the Seasonal Products 
shall be introduced at all Kmart stores in time for the Christmas season in 
2002, provided that each party acknowledges certain products requiring 
substantial developmental lead-times will not be available until 2003. The 
portion of the Martha Stewart Everyday program comprising Garden Products shall 
be conducted according to the terms set forth on Schedule VI(8) hereto as well 
as the rest of the terms of this Agreement. VII. Term. This Agreement shall 
commence on August 1, 2001 and continue in full force and effect until January 
31, 2008 (the &quot;Term&quot;). Provided that (i) the aggregate royalties 
earned by, and paid to, MSO hereunder with respect to Sales of the Initial 
Products occurring from August 1, 2001 through January 31, 2007 equals or 
exceeds [ * * * ], and (ii) the royalties earned by, and paid to, MSO with 
respect to Sales of the Initial Products during the four quarters ending 
January 31, 2007 equals or exceeds [ * * * ], this Agreement shall 
automatically be 7 &lt;PAGE&gt; 8 renewed for an additional five years (the 
&quot;Renewal Term&quot;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term commences as 
of the date hereof solely with respect to the terms of Section XXIX hereof. 
VIII. Promotional and Marketing Services. (1) MSO shall cause Stewart to render 
her services in a professional manner consistent with the intent of this 
Agreement and to use her reasonable good faith efforts to participate in the 
promotion and imaging of the Licensed Products including, without limitation, 
through television, radio and print advertising, in-store videos, appearances 
and other media presentations or programs and shall use reasonable and 
appropriate opportunities, in her reasonable discretion, to promote the 
Licensed Products and Kmart's sale thereof including, without limitation, 
interviews, editorials, press conferences, press releases and television 
appearances. In light of the considerable demands on Stewart's schedule, Kmart 
and MSO shall cooperate in good faith to schedule the dates, times, places and 
manner in which Stewart shall fulfill her obligations under this Section as far 
in advance, and in the most convenient manner, possible. Subject to the final 
sentence of this Section VIII(1), MSO shall cause Martha Stewart to be 
available to render services under this Section VIII(1) consistent with past 
practices under the Prior Agreements, but in no event for more than 25 days 
annually, inclusive of travel time. Kmart shall pay all costs and expenses in 
connection with such services including, without limitation, costs of first 
class air travel (or private plane) and lodging consistent with Kmart's past 
practices with Stewart under the Prior Agreements as of the date hereof. Any 
significant expenses anticipated by MSO in excess of those generally borne by 
Kmart pursuant to past practice under the Prior Agreements shall be first 
submitted to Kmart for approval. No failure by MSO to comply with the terms of 
this provision by reason of the death, disability or incapacity of Martha 
Stewart shall be considered a breach of this Agreement. (2) Each year, Kmart 
and MSO shall consult regarding the advertising needs for the Licensed Products 
for the following year, taking into account the existence of any Additional 
Products and extensions of existing product lines, following which Kmart shall 
determine the aggregate amount to be spent on advertising for the Licensed 
Products (&quot;MSE Advertising&quot;) during such year. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the aggregate amount to be spent on MSE Advertising during any 
twelve-month period ending on any January 31 throughout the Term (the 
&quot;Annual MSE Ad Spend&quot;), commencing with the twelve-month period 
ending January 31, 2002, shall represent a percentage of projected Sales for 
such period that is no less than the percentage that estimated MSE Advertising 
expenditures for 2001 as of the date hereof (such estimate, the &quot;2001 MSE 
Ad Spend&quot;) represents of Sales for 2001, provided, however, that the 
Annual MSE Ad Spend for any year shall not represent a larger percentage of the 
aggregate advertising expenditures by Kmart during such year than the 
percentage that the 2001 MSE Ad Spend represents of Kmart's aggregate 
advertising expenditures during 2001. Marketing expenses relating to 
significant product launches shall be outside of this budget. Kmart and MSO 
agree that in the event of a Renewal Term the parties shall review whether the 
foregoing method of determining levels of MSE Ad Spend is in the mutual best 
interest of MSO and Kmart and shall make any changes thereto that are mutually 
agreed upon at the time of such renewal. Kmart and MSO shall discuss the best 
allocation of the year's advertising budget between production, media 
selection, and timing of advertising campaigns. Although MSO shall be given the 
opportunity to meaningfully consult with Kmart regarding such allocation, Kmart 
shall make the final determination as to how such money should be allocated, 
provided that amounts dedicated to creative development and production of 
advertisements on a per advertisement basis shall be mutually agreed upon each 
year and shall be at least consistent with past practice under the Prior 
Agreements. Once the allocations have been made and the advertising needs 
determined, MSO 8 &lt;PAGE&gt; 9 shall be responsible for developing all 
creative elements of, and, with respect to television advertisements, 
producing, all advertising for the Licensed Products. In doing so, MSO may, 
subject to the approved budgets, retain independent advertising agencies, 
production companies and photographers to assist in developing, creating and 
producing the advertisements. All such advertisements remain subject to Kmart's 
approval. Kmart shall pay MSO the budgeted amounts for all creative development 
and production, out of which MSO shall pay any third party fees including, 
where appropriate and approved, any creative service fees to MSO. All media 
buying for advertising of the Licensed Products will continue to be done by 
Kmart's advertising agency of record. Kmart further agrees to continue 
purchasing advertising, whether or not for Licensed Products, in Martha Stewart 
Living media properties at 2001 expenditure levels. (3) With respect to each 
television commercial relating in whole or part to the Licensed Products and 
featuring Stewart, Kmart shall pay to MSO [ * * * ] for Stewart's appearance in 
each such commercial. The foregoing payment shall be an advance against all 
residuals owed to Stewart pursuant to any applicable union, guild, or 
collective bargaining agreement on account of the use and reuse of such 
commercials, provided that such residuals shall be credited and payable at 
twice scale. Kmart shall pay or cause to be paid any and all pension, health 
and/or welfare fund payments required by reason of Stewart's services hereunder 
pursuant to any applicable union, guild or collective bargaining agreement and 
covenants that Kmart, or any other entity for whom Stewart is rendering her 
services in connection with each such commercial, shall be a signatory to any 
applicable union, guild and collective bargaining agreement. The per commercial 
fee payable hereunder shall increase by 4% each calendar year. (4) Kmart shall 
sell Licensed Products only through the Martha Stewart Everyday 
&quot;store-in-store&quot; format, including, but not limited to, the 
fixturing, signage, and layouts of such &quot;store-in-stores.&quot; Unless 
there are compelling business reasons dictating otherwise, Licensed Products 
shall be sold in dedicated, full-run shelf-space. In no event will products 
that compete with Licensed Products be commingled with Licensed Products in 
Kmart stores. The &quot;store-in-store&quot; format employed by Kmart shall be 
developed with the assistance of MSO and shall be subject to MSO's reasonable 
approval. IX. Property Retention. (1) All right, title and interest in the 
Licensed Property including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks and 
other rights therein (and all renewals and extensions thereof) shall be owned 
exclusively by MSO. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, MSO shall have the 
sole unrestricted right to exploit the Licensed Property in its sole discretion 
in any manner in perpetuity in any and all media throughout the world whether 
now known or hereafter devised with no further obligation whatsoever to Kmart 
or any third party. Any use which Kmart may be permitted to make of the 
Licensed Property pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to MSO's prior 
approval as specified herein. (2) Kmart confirms the sole ownership by MSO of 
the Licensed Property and agrees that all use by Kmart of the Licensed Property 
shall inure solely to the benefit of MSO and, as such, Kmart shall not at any 
time acquire any rights in the Licensed Property or otherwise by virtue of any 
use or exploitation Kmart may make thereof. (3) All rights in the Licensed 
Property other than those specifically granted herein are reserved by MSO for 
its sole use and benefit and exploitation in its sole discretion. Upon the 
expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, all 
rights in the Licensed 9 &lt;PAGE&gt; 10 Property shall automatically revert to 
MSO for its sole use and disposition with no further obligation whatsoever to 
Kmart or any third party, provided, however, Kmart shall have six months from 
the date of termination, or three months from expiration, whichever the case 
may be, to sell all units of Licensed Products purchased or ordered before 
expiration or termination of this Agreement and to use the associated Materials 
approved pursuant to this Agreement prior to such expiration or termination to 
accomplish such sell-off. MSO shall be paid royalties on all such sales at the 
applicable rates under this Agreement. (4) Kmart agrees to promptly inform MSO 
of any use by any person or entity of a trademark, servicemark or design 
similar to the Licensed Property which comes to the attention of Kmart and 
which Kmart has reason to believe could be a use unauthorized by MSO. MSO shall 
have the sole right to determine whether or not any action shall be taken on 
account of any infringement and Kmart shall join in such action at Kmart's 
expense if MSO so requests. Kmart shall have no right to take any action with 
respect to the Licensed Property without prior written approval from MSO which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. MSO and Kmart shall share any 
award of damages net of costs including, without limitation, attorneys' fees 
and disbursements, as a result of such actions, in proportion to their 
respective damages suffered by such infringement. (5) All designs, concepts, 
patterns, names and other intellectual property (including copyright rights) in 
materials relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any Prior 
Agreement that are developed and/or created by MSO shall be owned solely by 
MSO. All designs, concepts, patterns, names and other intellectual property 
(including copyright rights) in materials relating to the subject matter of 
this Agreement or any Prior Agreement that are developed and/or created by 
third parties under MSO's direction, or which are incorporated into the 
Licensed Products and/or the Materials at MSO's request, shall, as between MSO 
and Kmart, be owned solely by MSO. All designs, concepts, patterns, names and 
other intellectual property (including copyright rights) in materials relating 
to the subject matter of this Agreement or any Prior Agreement that are 
developed and/or created by Kmart shall be owned solely by Kmart. Subject to 
all other provisions of this Agreement, the physical elements of all Materials 
will be and remain the property of Kmart, provided that, in the event MSO owns 
the intellectual property therein, Kmart will provide the necessary access to 
enable MSO to duplicate any such Materials. (6) Nothing contained herein shall 
be construed as an assignment or grant to Kmart of any right, title or interest 
in or to the Licensed Property, it being understood that all rights thereto are 
reserved exclusively by MSO, except for the license granted hereunder as 
specifically described herein. X. Representations and Warranties. (1) By MSO. 
MSO represents and warrants to Kmart that (i) it has the full right and 
authority to enter into this Agreement and to grant the licenses herein, and 
(ii) Kmart's authorized use of the Licensed Property shall not infringe or 
violate the rights of any third parties. (2) By Kmart. Kmart hereby represents 
and warrants to MSO that (i) it has the full right and authority to enter into 
this Agreement and the relationship contemplated herein, (ii) the manufacture, 
distribution, marketing, sale and use of the Licensed Products shall not 
violate or infringe upon any rights whatsoever of any third party (except as a 
result of a breach of MSO's 10 &lt;PAGE&gt; 11 representations and warranties), 
(iii) the Licensed Products (including any labeling thereon) will conform in 
all respects to, and satisfy applicable requirements of, applicable federal, 
state and local laws, orders and regulations, and (iv) Kmart has sufficient 
systems to accurately track, and that it will accurately track, all Sales. XI. 
Indemnification. (1) Kmart agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MSO 
and its officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees and 
representatives from, in respect of and against any and all claims, losses, 
liabilities, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' 
fees and disbursements), judgments, damages, demands, lawsuits or similar 
actions or proceedings (&quot;Claims&quot;) arising out of the breach of any of 
Kmart's representations, warranties or covenants hereunder (or under any Prior 
Agreement) or out of the manufacture, design, purchase, promotion, advertising, 
distribution, use or sale of Licensed Products, including, without limitation, 
any claims for product liability (a &quot;Kmart Claim&quot;). MSO agrees to 
notify Kmart within a reasonable time after it receives notice of any Kmart 
Claim and Kmart shall promptly assume MSO's defense thereof either directly or 
through counsel to any relevant vendor. MSO shall have the right to participate 
in the defense of any Kmart Claim with counsel of its choosing and at MSO's 
expense. Any settlement which affects the Licensed Property or otherwise 
contains a remedy other than the payment of money damages by Kmart (which in 
any way impacts upon MSO) must be approved in writing in advance by MSO. (2) 
MSO agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Kmart and its officers, 
directors, shareholders, employees and representatives from, in respect of and 
against any and all Claims arising out of the breach of any of MSO's 
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder (or under any Prior 
Agreement) or for copyright, trade dress, or trademark infringement or unfair 
trade practice arising directly out of Kmart's authorized use of the Licensed 
Property (an &quot;MSO Claim&quot;). Kmart agrees to notify MSO within a 
reasonable time after it receives notice of any MSO Claim and MSO shall 
promptly assume Kmart's defense thereof. Kmart shall have the right to 
participate in the defense of any MSO Claim with counsel of its choosing and at 
Kmart's expense. Any settlement which contains a remedy other than the payment 
of money damages by MSO (which in any way impacts upon Kmart) must be approved 
in writing in advance by Kmart. XII. Insurance. Kmart shall maintain in full 
force and effect comprehensive general liability insurance (the 
&quot;Insurance&quot;), including, without limitation, product liability 
insurance, covering all Licensed Products sold by it as well as any liability 
on its part or the part of MSO in the amount of at least $25,000,000 per 
occurrence and $100,000,000 in the aggregate. The Insurance shall be placed 
with an insurer or insurers of recognized worth and reputation, duly licensed 
to carry on the business of insurance in all parts of the Territory and shall 
name Martha Stewart, MSO, its officers, directors, employees, representatives 
or agents as additional insureds, for coverage against all forms of liability 
for death or injury to any individual, and for loss or damage to property. The 
Insurance shall provide for primary coverage and not contributory coverage, 
notwithstanding any other insurance which MSO may obtain or maintain. The 
Insurance shall provide for prior written notice to MSO of cancellation, lapse 
or material change in the Insurance and Kmart shall provide MSO with a 
certificate of insurance as evidence of the Insurance prior to, or as soon as 
practicable after, the execution hereof. MSO hereby acknowledges that Kmart 
self-insures a per claim deductible in the amount of $2,000,000. 11 
&lt;PAGE&gt; 12 XIII. Guaranteed Products. Kmart agrees to manufacture and 
market Licensed Products in the categories of merchandise set forth on Schedule 
XIII hereto upon request from MSO and to use reasonable commercial efforts to 
cause Licensed Products in each such product category to be available at each 
Kmart store. XIV. Projections. Schedule XIV sets forth the projections for 
annual Sales relating to the Initial Products through the Term and the 
Extension, if any, as of the date hereof (the &quot;Initial Projections&quot;). 
Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, MSO and Kmart agree to 
develop a strategy for materially increasing Sales in each Product Category to 
the maximum extent practicable. The projections set forth on Schedule XIV shall 
be increased as a result of the outcome of such efforts (the projections as 
they may be increased from time to time, the &quot;Projections&quot;), and MSO 
and Kmart agree to meet at least annually to strategize and otherwise develop 
programs and plans to maximize Sales and increase Projections. Kmart agrees to 
use its best efforts to cause Sales to equal or exceed the Projections. XV. [ * 
* * ]. XVI. Kmart Bridal and Gift Registry. MSO hereby grants Kmart the right 
to offer the Licensed Products as part of a Kmart bridal and/or gift registry 
program, provided that the registry is not branded with the name &quot;Martha 
Stewart&quot; or any related trademark and all aspects of the sale, marketing, 
presentation, promotion and advertisement of the Licensed Products in 
connection therewith shall be subject to the same approvals, rights, and 
processes as the sale, marketing, presentation, promotion, and advertisement of 
the Licensed Products under this Agreement generally. XVII. Termination. (1) 
Subject to subparagraph (2) below, this Agreement may be immediately terminated 
by either party in the event a material breach hereof by the other party 
continues uncured for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof, 
provided, however, such cure period shall be 15 days with respect to payments 
due hereunder. (2) In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, 
all rights granted hereunder shall terminate and revert to MSO for its sole use 
and disposition without any further obligation to Kmart. XVIII. Uniqueness of 
Services. The services to be performed by MSO and the rights and privileges 
granted to Kmart hereunder are special, unique and incapable of replacement and 
the loss thereof may not be reasonably or adequately compensated in an action 
at law. Additionally, MSO's failure or refusal to perform the obligations 
hereunder may cause irreparable harm or damage. In the event of a material 
breach by MSO, Kmart shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies 
available to it, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against it to 
prevent the continuance of such failure or refusal or to prevent it from 
performing services or granting rights to others in violation of this 
Agreement. XIX. Services. MSO assumes no liability whatsoever for service, 
defects or breach of warranty or any type of product liability claim whatsoever 
regarding Licensed Products. In the event that an ultimate purchaser of such a 
Licensed Product or any other third party claims it to be defective, in breach 
of warranty or in need of service, Kmart or its vendor shall assume all 
obligations, liability, cost and expense relating in any manner to such 
Licensed Product 12 &lt;PAGE&gt; 13 including, without limitation, any claimed 
defect, breach of warranty or service need. In the event any such Licensed 
Product is returned to MSO on account of any claimed defect, breach of warranty 
or service need, MSO shall promptly notify Kmart regarding such Licensed 
Product and claim and shall forward the same within a reasonable time to a 
reasonable destination designated by Kmart for handling of the returned 
Licensed Product by Kmart or its vendor. Kmart agrees to reimburse MSO for all 
reasonable costs incurred in connection with such returns. Kmart agrees to keep 
MSO timely informed of any material problems with any Licensed Product and 
shall meaningfully consult with MSO in a timely fashion in the event Kmart 
and/or any vendors of Licensed Products interact with the United States 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (&quot;CPSC&quot;) and before any Section 15 
Report relating to any Licensed Product is filed with CPSC. XX. Creative 
Services. As reasonably requested by Kmart, MSO shall periodically provide 
creative personnel to consult with Kmart regarding issues relating to overall 
Kmart advertising, store layout and other brand issues. XXI. Assignment. No 
party may assign any right or obligation under this Agreement, other than the 
right to receive money, to any person or entity other than its parent or 
subsidiary companies or a purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets 
of a party, without the express written consent of the other party, provided 
that MSO shall have the right to assign its interests under this Agreement to 
any entity in which Martha Stewart owns a majority of the equity, and which at 
or about the time of such assignment acquires the rights to the Licensed 
Property licensed to Kmart hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the 
event either party enters into a transaction in which it sells or otherwise 
conveys substantially all of the assets relevant to such party's performance of 
its obligations hereunder, the other party shall have the right to compel 
assignment of this Agreement as part of such transaction. MSO shall have the 
right to cause any of its contractual obligations hereunder to be fulfilled by 
an affiliate of MSO, and any such fulfillment shall be deemed a fulfillment of 
such obligation by MSO. For purposes of clarity, it is acknowledged that Martha 
Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. 
(collectively, &quot;MSLO&quot;) were each predecessors-in-interest to MSO 
under the Prior Agreements, and references herein to MSO in connection with the 
Prior Agreements or actions taken thereunder shall include references to MSLO 
as the context requires. XXII. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be construed 
and enforced in accordance with laws of the State of Michigan. XXIII. No Joint 
Venture. Neither party shall be or be deemed to be an agent, employee, partner 
or joint venturer of or for the other party. XXIV. Confidentiality. After the 
date hereof, each of Kmart and MSO (i) shall hold and shall cause its officers, 
directors, employees, agents, accountants, representatives and advisors 
(&quot;Representatives&quot;) to hold in strict confidence all the terms of 
this Agreement and the Prior Agreements and all information furnished to such 
party or its Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement as well as information concerning the other party contained 
in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or on behalf 
of such party (collectively, the &quot;Information&quot;); provided that the 
Information shall not include any information which has become (A) generally 
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such party or 
such party's Representatives, (B) available to such party on a non- 13 
&lt;PAGE&gt; 14 confidential basis from a source other than the other party or 
the agents of one of them if such source is to such party's knowledge entitled 
to disclose such information, or (C) independently acquired or developed by 
such party; and (ii) shall not, without the prior written consent of the other 
party, release or disclose any Information to any other person, except (A) to 
such person's Representatives who need to know the Information in connection 
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, who 
are informed by such person of the confidential nature of the Information and 
who are caused by the relevant party to comply with the terms and conditions of 
this Section XXV, and (B) as may be required by applicable law, regulations or 
legal processes (including, without limitation, any disclosures of Information 
which are required to be made by applicable securities laws in connection with 
any financing activities of either party or standard disclosure requirements 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The parties hereto 
agree to cooperate with respect to a joint press release announcing the 
execution of this Agreement. XXV. Notice. All notices under this Agreement 
shall be in writing and shall be given by either party by certified mail, 
guaranteed express mail or facsimile (confirmation of delivery received) as

&lt;PAGE&gt; 15 Facsimile No. (248) 637-3057 XXVI. Compliance with Human Rights 
and Labor Standards. Kmart warrants and represents that purchase order terms 
and conditions for the purchase of all Licensed Products require that such 
merchandise conforms in all respects with all applicable federal, state and 
local laws, orders and regulations. Kmart will require all manufacturers of 
Licensed Products hereunder to sign a Certification of Compliance substantially 
similar to the form attached hereto as Schedule XXVII. Upon written request 
from MSO, Kmart shall supply MSO with the identification of all manufacturers 
of Licensed Products. Upon reasonable prior written notice of MSO and at MSO's 
sole expense, MSO shall have the right to inspect the physical facilities of 
any manufacturer of Licensed Products for the purpose of assuring that such 
manufacturer is in satisfactory compliance with legal and ethical human rights 
and labor standards and shall have the right to refuse approval of any Licensed 
Product manufactured by any such manufacturer which after such inspection may 
be reasonably found not to be in substantial compliance with such standards. 
XXVII. Bankruptcy. Kmart and MSO shall each, in addition to its other rights, 
have the right, on written notice to the other, to terminate this Agreement if 
the other party files a petition in bankruptcy, or is adjudicated a bankrupt, 
or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against it and is not dismissed within 
(60) days thereafter, or if it becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for 
the benefit of creditors, or files a petition or otherwise seeks relief under 
or pursuant to any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization 
statute or procedure, or if a custodian, receiver or trustee is appointed for 
it or a substantial portion of its business or assets (and such receivership is 
not discharged within sixty (60) days thereafter). XXVIII. Integration. This 
Agreement shall be the final and complete agreement between Kmart and MSO with 
respect to the subject matter hereof. No representations, inducements, premises 
or understandings exist in relation to the subject matter hereof, whether oral 
or written, except as expressly set forth herein, and this Agreement shall 
supercede all prior understandings, agreements, contracts or arrangements 
between the parties, whether oral or written, unless otherwise expressly 
incorporated herein. No agreement or other understanding purporting to add to 
or to modify the terms and conditions hereof shall be binding unless agreed to 
by the parties in writing. Any terms or conditions in any forms of the parties 
used in the performance of this Agreement which are in conflict with the terms 
and conditions hereof shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Prior 
Agreements shall continue in full force and effect through July 31, 2001, and 
shall continue to govern matters arising under such agreements prior to August 
1, 2001 (including, without limitation, payment obligations relating to periods 
prior to August 1, 2001), unless otherwise indicated herein. XXIX. Interim 
Period. From the date hereof through July 31, 2001, Kmart agrees that it shall 
continue to conduct its purchasing practices with vendors and inventory 
replenishment practices and all other matters relating to the calculation of 
the royalties payable under the Prior Agreements in a manner consistent with 
past practice and without any regard for the switch in the basis for 
calculating royalties to MSO from wholesale purchases to retail sales that will 
occur on August 1, 2001. 15 &lt;PAGE&gt; 16 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties 
have executed this Agreement on the date first above written. KMART CORPORATION

AGREEMENT MARTHA STEWART LIVING OMNIMEDIA, INC. 11 WEST 42ND STREET NEW YORK, 
NEW YORK 10036 As of ____________________ [Vendor Name and Address] Re: 
&quot;Martha Stewart Everyday&quot; Dear ______________________: As you know, 
you may soon be, or have been, manufacturing products to be sold under the 
&quot;Martha Stewart Everyday&quot; brand. Although these products will be 
and/or have been manufactured by you pursuant to agreements between you and 
certain retailers, you recognize that such retailers have made this agreement a 
condition to your manufacturing &quot;Martha Stewart Everyday&quot; products 
(the &quot;Products&quot;) for them. Accordingly, in consideration of your 
selection, or potential selection, to manufacture certain Products, you hereby 
agree with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. (&quot;MSLO&quot;) as follows: 
1. For the purposes of this Agreement, &quot;Proprietary Materials&quot; shall 
mean all (i) information or material, whether or not in tangible form, relating 
to MSLO or Martha Stewart or which is supplied to you by MSLO, or which is 
supplied to you by an Approved Retailer (as hereafter defined) in connection 
with the Products, other than (A) any such information known to you, or 
material in your possession, prior to the commencement of your discussions 
regarding the manufacture of Products with any Approved Retailer or MSLO, as 
the case may be, (B) any such information generally known to, or such materials 
generally possessed by, the public at large (other than as a result of (X) a 
breach of this agreement by you, (Y) distribution of the Products, or (Z) the 
acts of any other party which you know, or have reason to know, is under an 
obligation of confidentiality to MSLO), and (C) any such information or 
material acquired by you from a third party (other than a third party which you 
know, or have reason to know, is under an obligation of confidentiality to MSLO 
or who acquired such information or material as a result of the distribution of 
the Products), (ii) materials, whether or not in tangible form, which you 
develop with MSLO or with any contribution, input, advice or direction 
whatsoever from MSLO (the &quot;Vendor Materials&quot;) (for the sake of 
clarity, Vendor Materials shall include the entire applicable material, not 
just the portion developed with MSLO's contribution, input, advice or 
direction), and (iii) information or materials, whether or not in tangible 
form, with respect to which you gain access or knowledge as a direct result of 
(A) your relationship relating to the Products with an Approved Retailer 24 
&lt;PAGE&gt; 25 or MSLO, as the case may be, or (B) carrying out any of your 
obligations to MSLO or an Approved Retailer relating to the Products. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Proprietary Materials shall include any 
Materials (as defined below) in which MSLO owns any proprietary rights 
(including, without limitation, any copyright rights, trademark rights, or 
other intellectual property rights). The Proprietary Materials may include, but 
are not necessarily limited to, the following: concepts; techniques; data; 
documentation; research and development; customer lists; advertising plans; 
distribution networks; new product concepts; intellectual property of all 
types, including, without limitation, designs, patterns, ideas, and any 
physical manifestations thereof; prints; sketches; planned introduction dates; 
processes; marketing procedures; &quot;know-how&quot;; marketing techniques and 
materials; development plans; names and other information related to strategic 
partners, suppliers, or vendors; pricing policies and strategic, business or 
financial information, including business plans and financial pro formas (all 
of the foregoing, &quot;Materials&quot;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
Proprietary Materials shall not include materials you develop at your sole cost 
and expense with no contribution, input, advice or direction whatsoever from 
MSLO (the &quot;_____ Materials&quot;); provided, however, that no ______ 
Materials may in any way contain, embody or reference any Proprietary 
Materials, including, without limitation, any MSLO trademark, servicemark, 
mark, name or other designation. For purposes of this Agreement, &quot;Approved 
Retailers&quot; shall mean those entities set forth on Exhibit A hereto, which 
exhibit may be amended from time to time by MSLO. 2. You acknowledge that MSLO 
exclusively owns, in perpetuity and throughout the world, all right, title and 
interest, including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks and other 
proprietary rights (and all renewals and extensions thereof) embodied in, or 
related to, the Proprietary Materials, and any and all good will therein. You 
recognize the great value of the publicity and good will associated with the 
Proprietary Materials and acknowledge that such value and good will belongs 
exclusively to MSLO. You agree that you shall not acquire any rights in or to 
the Proprietary Materials by virtue of your performance of any obligations to 
MSLO or any Approved Retailer or otherwise. Any use which you may make of the 
Proprietary Materials shall solely be pursuant to your agreements with MSLO or 
the Approved Retailers in connection with the Products and shall not restrict, 
limit or otherwise diminish MSLO's rights therein with respect to any other 
products or use. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Vendor Materials 
shall be and/or have been solely created by you as a 
&quot;work-made-for-hire&quot; specially commissioned by MSLO for use in 
connection with the Products pursuant to the United States Copyright Act, and 
any and all extensions and/or renewals thereof, it being understood that in the 
event any of the Vendor Materials are determined not to be a 
&quot;work-made-for-hire&quot;, then you hereby irrevocably assign to MSLO all 
rights therein. You represent and warrant that (i) 25 &lt;PAGE&gt; 26 you shall 
not undertake or cause any third party to undertake any act that violates, 
infringes, diminishes, challenges or otherwise conflicts with MSLO's exclusive 
ownership of all rights, title and interest in and to the Proprietary 
Materials, and (ii) that MSLO's exploitation of the Vendor Materials shall not 
infringe the rights of any third party. 1. All notes, data, reference 
materials, sketches, drawings, memoranda, documentation and records in any way 
incorporating or reflecting any of the Proprietary Materials shall belong 
exclusively to MSLO and you agree to turn over all copies of such materials in 
your possession or control to MSLO upon the earlier of MSLO's request or 
termination of the final agreement pursuant to which you manufacture any 
Products. 2. You shall hold in confidence and not directly or indirectly 
reveal, report, publish, disclose or transfer any of the Proprietary Materials 
in any form to any person or entity, nor shall you utilize any of the 
Proprietary Materials for any purpose, except in each case as may be necessary 
in the course of your manufacture of Products, provided that no Proprietary 
Materials which are designated as being &quot;confidential&quot; by MSLO may be 
revealed, reported, published, disclosed or transferred without the express 
written consent of MSLO. You shall cause each of your employees, agents or 
representatives that is provided access to any Proprietary Materials to abide 
by the same obligations and restrictions to which you are subject hereunder. 3. 
You agree that you shall not sell any products incorporating any of the 
Proprietary Materials to any entity other than MSLO or an Approved Retailer, 
except as expressly permitted herein. 4. Upon receipt of a notice from MSLO or 
an Approved Retailer that any Products manufactured by you are deficient in 
quality or are not consistent with the relevant specifications, or in the event 
of an Overrun (as hereafter defined), you may sell such deficient Products or 
Products with respect to which there has been an Overrun (collectively, 
&quot;Excess Products&quot;) to parties other than Approved Retailers, provided 
that (i) no use of or reference to the name Martha Stewart, MSLO or any 
variation thereof is used in connection with any advertising, publicity, 
labeling, wrapping or packaging with respect to any such sales, (ii) that prior 
to making any such sale you receive assurances from the party to whom you sell 
such Excess Products that they will comply, and will cause any subsequent 
purchasers to comply, with the terms of sub-clause (i) above, and (iii) that 
such sales are made to purchasers who have warranted to you in writing that 
they shall only re-sell the Excess Products outside of North America (unless 
prior approval for North American sales is received from MSLO or the Approved 
Retailer for whom the Excess Products were originally manufactured). For 
purposes of this Agreement, there shall be an &quot;Overrun&quot; on a Product 
only in the event that (1) you have received notice from all Approved Retailers 
for whom you manufacture such Product that such Approved Retailers do not 
intend to purchase any more of such Product from you in the future, (2) you 
have delivered to the relevant Approved Retailers and to MSLO the amount of 
Product in your possession with 26 &lt;PAGE&gt; 27 respect to which there is an 
Overrun, and (3) MSLO and the relevant Approved Retailers have approved the 
quantity of such Overrun. MSLO and the Approved Retailers may, in their sole 
discretion, limit the amount of Excess Product you may dispose of pursuant to 
the terms of this paragraph if they determine that the amount of such Products 
that you have on hand for such disposal is excessive and beyond the quantity 
you would have possessed had you followed a normal and prudent manufacturing 
schedule. 5. In the event that you receive a request to disclose any 
Proprietary Materials under a subpoena or court order, you will (a) promptly 
notify MSLO thereof, (b) consult with MSLO on the advisability of taking steps 
to resist or narrow such request, and (c) if disclosure is required or deemed 
advisable, cooperate with MSLO in any attempt that it may make to obtain an 
order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded 
to designated portions of the Proprietary Materials. 6. Because of the unique 
nature of the Proprietary Materials, you understand and agree that MSLO will 
suffer irreparable harm in the event that you fail to comply with any of your 
obligations hereunder and that monetary damages may be inadequate to fully 
compensate MSLO for such breach. Accordingly, you agree that MSLO will, in 
addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, be entitled 
to injunctive relief, including, without limitation, temporary restraining 
orders and/or preliminary injunctions, to enforce the terms of this Agreement. 
In the event of any breach or purported breach by MSLO hereunder, your rights 
shall be limited to an action at law for money damages actually suffered. In no 
event shall you be entitled to rescission, injunction or other equitable relief 
of any kind. 7. In case any one or more of the provisions (or portions of the 
provisions) of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, 
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or 
unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions (or portions of the 
provisions) of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed as if the 
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions (or portions of the provisions) 
had never been contained therein. 8. In the interest of being guided by a 
well-developed body of law in the event of a dispute, the parties agree that 
this Agreement, including the validity and enforceability hereof, shall be 
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York pertaining to 
agreements made and performed therein, and the courts located in the State of 
New York, County of New York (federal, if jurisdiction is present, state, if 
federal jurisdiction is lacking), shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue 
over all disputes hereunder. Upon execution hereof by your authorized 
signatory, this letter shall constitute a binding agreement between you and 
MSLO, enforceable according to its terms. Sincerely yours, 27 &lt;PAGE&gt; 28

the ability to determine the Martha Picks and will endeavor, along with Kmart, 
to maintain the secrecy of such picks, and that MSO will be permitted to

obligation applies not only to your own company, but to any subcontractors you 
may use in producing goods for Kmart. If Kmart learns that a factory used by 
any of our vendors for the production of merchandise has committed legal 
violations, or failed to comply with our standard Kmart order terms, we will: - 
Cancel the affected order(s) - Terminate our relationship with the vendor - 
Take legal action or pursue other equitable remedies to recoup any financial 
losses incurred by Kmart - Assess a payment to the vendor, equivalent to 50 
percent of the order(s), that Kmart will donate to a human rights or children's 
organization With our current and planned growth in global sourcing, Kmart is 
increasing our quality control staff to ensure compliance with all applicable 
human rights and labor standards as well as other critical elements of quality 
assurance. Consistent with these actions, we expect all of our vendors to 
increase their factory inspections and take vigilant and immediate action to 
eliminate any problems that are found to exist. Please sign and return the
