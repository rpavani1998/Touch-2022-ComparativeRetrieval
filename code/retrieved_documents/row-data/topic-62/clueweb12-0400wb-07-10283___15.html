<h2> 
<p>What are the Different Types of Bonsai</p></h2> 
<p>There are different ways of classifying bonsai. One way (used in Japan) is 
as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chokkan (straight trunk) - one straight trunk, with an even taper from the 
base to the top. Once established the lowest branches commence at about one 
quarter of the way up the trunk from the base. Branches alternate from side to 
side as you progress up the trunk.</li> 
<li>Shakan (bending trunk) - a single main trunk leaning slightly to the left 
or right.</li> 
<li>Bankan (curved trunk) - a single twisted trunk (e.g. bending in 4 
directions).</li> 
<li>Sokan (twin trunked) - a single tree with two separate trunks, one longer 
and thinner than the other.</li> 
<li>Saikei - a living landscape: often combining plants, rocks and water.</li> 
<li>Kabudachi (group of trees) - several trees growing together (up to 9).The 
bases are all together so they might almost appear to be the same tree. Trunks 
are branched on each tree to form odd numbers (1, 3, 5 etc. trunks) per tree.
</li> 
<li>Netsuranari (several trunks from the one root) - one plant that is split 
into several trunks at the base. There are usually between 3 and 5 trunks, but 
never more than 10.</li> 
<li>Yoseue (collective plantings) - several plants in one container to give 
the appearance of a forest.</li> 
<li>Kengai (drooping trunk) - a tree leaning to one side, and contorted. This 
is copying the appearance of trees growing in exposed conditions such as a 
rocky outcrop on a mountainside. These plants can be unstable, which is a 
disadvantage when displaying them.</li> 
<li>Ishizuki (tree with a stone) - the roots of the tree grow over the top of 
a rock and into the soil below.</li> 
<li>Suiseki (stone without plant) - here a stone, or several stones, is 
arranged in the bonsai pot without any plants at all.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<h2> 
<p>Tips for Choosing a Bonsai Pot</p></h2> 
<p>An integral part of bonsai is the container which is used to present the 
art form. The bonsai may remain in the same pot for several years or, in the 
case of older tress, for many years. It is important therefore that thepot 
suits the tree or composition within. You might like to think of it as being 
somewhat similar to a picture frame. It must complement and not take away from 
the picture by being too brightly coloured, too fancy, or too large. Likewise, 
a bonsai container must enhance the contents within. Although bonsai containers 
are usually quite shallow, it also needs to able to hold sufficient growing 
media for the plant. For instance, a fruit tree will need a deeper container in 
order that there is sufficient water for fruit development. They should also be 
frost proof so that they do not crack and break outdoors, and they must have 
adequate drainage holes.</p> 
<p>What's In A Pot?<br>
&bull; Deeper pots have fewer air spaces between the 
soil particles. The weight of the soil on top squashes the soil underneath. 
Deeper pots therefore need a more open soil mix.<br>
&bull; Wider containers 
are more stable (less likely to tip over).<br>
&bull; A pot needs to have a 
sufficient number of large drainage holes to allow water to drain quickly away 
from the bottom of the pot.<br>
&bull; Roots tend to coil more in a round pot 
than a square pot.<br>
&bull; Root coiling at the bottom of a pot is reduced if 
the base is more tapered.<br>
&bull; Roots tend to grow through the bottom of 
pots when there is moist soil, compost or mulch under the pot. Pots are 
therefore best stood on top of a dry, paved or flat stone surface.<br>
&bull; 
Sprinkling a layer of coarse sand over the pot surface will reduce weed 
problems, and control the growth of moss.</p> 
<p>Choosing a Bonsai Container<br>
All bonsai containers will have drainage 
holes, and occasionally containers will have sealed compartments to hold water 
(to form a lake), or holes to poke wire through when re-potting the bonsai. 
Drainage holes are of paramount importance to enable sufficient root aeration. 
Waterlogged plants will not thrive, and may even die. If you like the look of a 
container without drainage holes, then drill some into the base.</p> 
<p>Traditionally, bonsai pots are made of clay based substances such as 
porcelain, stoneware, and terracotta. The inside of a bonsai pot should never 
be glazed, although the outside can be. Unglazed pots in earthy tones usually 
look more pleasing than bright colours, although bright colours can work 
provided that there is some unity with the contents. Subtle glazes can work 
well, or crackled and speckled glazes - but not with all specimens. In some 
countries, it is possible to obtain marble, soapstone and other stone type 
containers. There is also a range of other pot materials (even including 
plastic) that can be perfectly acceptable provided they meet the needs of the 
bonsai. Remember that the pot is an integral part of the bonsai.</p> 
<p>Bonsai pots come in a wide range of sizes from as small as thimble sized 
mame pots to containers of eighteen inches in depth. Wide, shallow containers 
are well suited to group plantings and landscapes. Tall containers, which may 
be round, square, hexagonal, and so forth are best suited to cascade style 
plantings or semi-cascade bonsai. Plainer shapes such as these are better than 
more elaborate types, regardless of the bonsai style. A rectangular or square 
container would suit a more formal style than a round or oval container. Most 
bonsai specialist retail outlets offer a range of containers originating from 
the Tokaname area of Japan.</p> 
<p>A bonsai container should have a width which is approximately the same as 
the spread of the branches. The tree should never look lost by placing it in a 
container which is too large for it, nor should it look too big for the 
container. As a very general rule of thumb, the depth of the pot should be 
approximately the same as the width of the base of the trunk, the obvious 
exception being the cascade shaped bonsai which require deeper pots to balance 
their cascading form. Another approximation is that a vertical tree needs a 
container that is two thirds to three quarters the height of the tree in width, 
or a horizontal tree needs a container that is two thirds to three quarters the 
width of the tree. Smaller containers need to be deeper in proportion to width 
than do wider containers in order to provide sufficient soil and water for the 
bonsai plants. One should also bear in mind when potting up bonsai that a 
dormant deciduous tree will look more expansive once it comes into leaf.</p> 
<p>Some pots will be more effective with legs or a base stand. Such legs can 
assist with the drainage of a pot, as it raises the pot up above the level of 
the shelf. It is important that the pot is level to allow for optimum drainage. 
Uneven pot base stands can be corrected by filing or adding filler as needed. 
The bonsai display can be finished off by the addition of a bamboo mat or by 
placing it on a simple stone slab or plank of wood.</p>  &nbsp; <br>
