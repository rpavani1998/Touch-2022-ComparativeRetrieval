<p><strong>Growing Roses in Containers</strong></p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong><em>By Stan Barrett, <b><i>Colorado Master GardenerSM, Colorado

<p>The practice of growing roses in containers and the reasons for doing so 
have expanded in recent years. Not long ago roses were grown in containers 
almost as a last resort, because the gardener had run out of space or was 
limited to a patio or balcony. Roses that were regarded as suitable were 
generally limited to standard (&quot;tree&quot;) roses, miniatures and small 
floribundas. Nurseries have sold containerized roses for many years but they 
were usually removed from the pot and planted in the ground as soon as possible.
<b></b></p><b> 
<p>Why Use Containers?</p> </b>
<p><b></b>Lack of space is still a strong motivation, of course, but now the 
types of roses that are grown in pots for the long term include larger 
floribundas, hybrid teas and grandifloras, and even some of the modern shrub 
roses. This trend has been helped along by the introduction of affordable, 
large, lightweight pots and improvements in planting mixes.<b></b></p><b> </b>
<p><b></b>Recent developments in the Horticultural Therapy field have shown 
how gardeners who find it physically difficult to work at ground level can 
continue to pursue their hobby with containerized plants, since they can be 
located at a tabletop height.<b></b></p><b>

<p><b></b>Another important reason for growing roses in pots, which is 
becoming more popular each year, is to make it easier for the gardener/designer 
to assess the suitability of a new rose in the landscape. The compatibility of 
its color, size, form and all-round quality with the existing plantings can be 
tried out by placing the containerized rose in its proposed location for a year 
or longer before installing it in the ground.<b></b></p><b> </b>
<p><b></b>Rather than buying containerized roses, many gardeners now prefer to 
buy bare-root roses and pot them up themselves, using their favorite brand of 
high quality growing medium. Then they carefully nurse the new roses along, 
providing the proper amounts of water and nutrients, until planting time 
arrives. This approach involves more work but offers the best chance of 
developing healthy roots and top growth.<b></b></p><b> 
<p>What Type of Container is Best?</p> </b> 
<p>Most kinds of containers (which can include pots, tubs, troughs, hanging 
baskets, etc.) work well for roses, though most experienced gardeners have 
their favorites. The important requirements are that the container must be big 
enough to allow for proper root development and it must provide good drainage. 
It should also have a wide enough base to resist being blown over in a strong 
wind!</p> 
<p>Pots made of terra cotta, glazed ceramic, plastic, wood or even (for 
short-term use) biodegradable fiber are the containers most often used, with 
the ubiquitous black plastic nursery pots leading the way. Take care not to use 
a saucer underneath the pot, which would be an invitation to root rot!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Biodegradable pot</strong></p> 
<p>The size requirement is dictated by the anticipated mature size of the 
plant, of course, and it is better to err on the generous side. This also 
ensures that the pot will hold enough soil to avoid drying out too fast. To 
accommodate a hybrid tea, large floribunda, grandiflora or shrub rose a 
15-gallon pot is recommended. One of the smaller floribundas would be quite 
happy in a 10-gallon pot, while most miniatures fit well in the 4- or 5-gallon 
size. For temporary use, such as trying a new rose in the landscape, even the 
first group can be grown for a year or two in a 10-gallon pot.</p> <b>

<p><strong>What Planting Medium Should be Used?</strong></p> 
<p>This is another area in which personal preference reigns. Some rose growers 
insist on using a sterile soilless potting medium, with up to 50% Perlite added 
to lighten the mix and provide faster drainage. Others report success using a 
made-up mixture of, for example, 30% screened compost plus 30% Perlite plus 40% 
topsoil. To help root development superphosphate should be added to the mix 
(about &frac14; cup for large pots, 1 tablespoon for smaller pots) and many 
rosarians also add a slow-release fertilizer.</p> 
<p>For more detailed information on types of growing media, reflecting local 
availability, it is advisable to seek advice from your County Extension Office 
or a Consulting Rosarian living in your area.</p> 
<p><b>Do Containerized Roses Need Special Treatment?</b></p> 
<p>Cultural practice for roses grown in pots is different in some ways. One 
obvious difference is frequency of watering. Because it is essential to provide 
fast drainage the soil can dry out very quickly, so that daily watering is 
necessary in hot weather; in fact smaller pots may need to be watered twice 
daily during very hot spells. This in turn means that fertilizer applied to the 
soil will leach out rapidly, so more frequent fertilizing is necessary for best 
performance.</p> 
<p>It is advisable to change the soil every three years or so, by which time 
it is likely to show a buildup of soluble salts left by the fertilizer.. At the 
same time the roots should be inspected and trimmed back if the rose is 
becoming root-bound.</p> 
<p>There are a number of advantages enjoyed by the gardener who uses 
containers. For instance, the pots can be moved around to find out which 
exposure, in terms of sun and shade, best suits the rose. Concerns about 
freezing weather (or the dreaded hailstorms) can be addressed by moving the pot 
into a sheltered area. Treatment for pests or diseases is generally easier, 
since the rose can be isolated from the rest of the landscape for the required 
TLC.</p> 
<p>Growing roses in containers offers some real advantages if you are running 
short of garden space, or if you find that working at ground level has become 
too challenging, or if you simply want to experiment with an easily changed 
garden design featuring new roses.</p> 
<p>Large lightweight containers are now available which makes the potted rose 
easier to move around. Many types of roses have been found to respond well when 
planted in a pot. Cultural changes, compared with conventional &quot;in 
ground&quot; gardening, are minor and easily accomplished. In short, this 
method of growing roses can become a highly satisfying extension to the 
rosarian&#146;s hobby.</p>
