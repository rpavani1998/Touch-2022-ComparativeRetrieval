<h1>449 Indoor Pots And Planters</h1> <b>Popular Today.</b> Select style to 
narrow the results. 
<h2> Picking an indoor planter isn&rsquo;t that different from picking an 
outdoor planter. You want something that works with your home&rsquo;s decor, 
and you want something that just looks great &acirc;&#128;&#148; since a plant 
inherently stands out against most home&rsquo;s plush interiors. The main 
difference between indoor planters and outdoor planters lies in the focus of 
functionality. While an indoor planter doesn&rsquo;t need to wear as well as an 
outdoor planter does, good drainage is absolutely vital. A pot that drips, 
seeps out water, or doesn&rsquo;t have an adequate water tray can quickly ruin 
a hardwood floor or end table. Even worse is a hanging planter that 
doesn&rsquo;t hold water quite right &acirc;&#128;&#148; a little over-watering 
can quickly turn into a huge mess. Make sure the planters you purchase will 
actually drain (otherwise your plants may suffocate. Also check that they have 
a catch tray or some other way to prevent the extra water from spilling out.<br>
<br> The amazing creativity that exists in modern indoor planter design can 
allow for extremely low maintenance plant life in your home. Before buying an 
indoor planter, choose one that not only fits with your decor, but holds plants 
with a maintenance level that fits your lifestyle, and has the ability to keep 
those plants alive.<br>
<br>
<b>Terrariums</b> have become a hugely popular 
alternative to the standard indoor planter. Not only are these plant holders 
sleek and modern in style, but they also practically take care of themselves. 
There are terrariums in virtually every size, with some that are meant to sit 
on tables and windowsills, while others hang from hooks in the ceiling. Pay 
attention to what type of plants will be in the terrarium before deciding where 
you want it to go, since some will need more sunlight than others.<br>
<br>
<b>
Wall Mounted or Ceiling Planters</b> are both great ways to incorporate plant 
life into your home without having to take up any space. Again, check for 
drainage with these. Many versions will have a catch tray or other mechanism 
built in to capture the overflow of water. If there are holes without a tray, 
or no drainage holes at all, just be aware of the potential mess.<br>
<br>
 The 
variety of indoor planters today is remarkable. They come in all types of 
materials: ceramic, metal, plastic, clay; and in all types of styles. With a 
little research, it&rsquo;s easy to pick a style that&rsquo;s right for any 
room in your home. Find indoor pots and planters design ideas here. </h2>
