<p>May 28, 2009 in Mr Green Archive | 1 comment </p> 
<p>In 1980, NASA proposed a complete solution to the problems of pollution and 
population growth. Their study cost 12 million dollars and was published in the 
form of a large book titled &ldquo;Advanced Automation for Space 
Missions.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s available as a free PDF file, a printed book, and 
as web pages.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>NASA&rsquo;s solution was simple: They&rsquo;d build a fully automated, 
solar-powered factory and land it on the Moon in the year 2000. Without any 
help from human workers, the 100 ton factory would mine the soil around it, 
would manufacture spare parts to maintain and repair itself, and would 
manufacture enough extra parts to assemble a copy of itself in one year. Each 
factory would build a copy of itself the following year, and so on. The factory 
population would increase exponentially according to the simple formula below:
</p> 
<p>factories = 2years</p> 
<p>In 10 years there would be a thousand factories, and in 30 years there 
would be a billion. The billion 100-ton factories that NASA proposed would be 
less than one millionth of 1% of the Moon.</p> 
<p><br>
 fig 5.12 Self-Replicating Factory</p> 
<p><br>
 fig 5.19 Self-Growing Factory</p> 
<p>At any time, new software could be loaded into the factories to produce 
consumer goods like solar power cells, electric cars, and automated greenhouses 
for delivery to Earth in great numbers. The flexibility to change production is 
a key aspect of the factories. By definition, each factory would have the 
capacity to produce its own weight of hi-tech machinery annually: their 
combined industrial output would be 100 billion tons. That&rsquo;s 10 tons 
(about 6 mid-size cars worth) a year for each of 10 billion people. At that 
rate it would take more than 100 years to use-up only 0.0001% of our moon. Long 
before Earth&rsquo;s moon was harmed or depleted, industry would be moved to a 
large asteroid or moon in the outer solar system.</p> 
<p>In this future scenario there would be no industrial pollution on Earth, 
limitless solar energy would be available, public wealth would be maximized, 
and the Moon would be barely touched by it. That&rsquo;s the recipe for utopia.
</p> 
<p>As documented in NASA&rsquo;s study, all the required resources are in 
plentiful supply on the moon. Since we already know how to make industry work, 
all that&rsquo;s really required is to replace human muscle with machine 
muscle. So if the payoff was thought to be only 50 years away with 1980 
technology, how long starting with 2009 technology? For example, modern 
engineering software will cut years from the design process, and a modern 
design might reproduce in six months instead of a year. The payoff could be 
only 25 years away.</p> 
<p>A decade or two after the first self-replicating factory became operational 
we would be able to mass-produce any machines we want for the small cost of 
designing them. The potentials are endless, but two possibilities stand out.</p>
<p>(1) We could design automated, family-sized greenhouses and have them 
delivered to everyone. They&rsquo;d be self-repairing, electrically lighted, 
and designed as sub-basements to our homes. Fruits, vegetables, grains, poultry 
and fish would be delivered automatically on demand, and toilet sewage would be 
processed as fertilizer to close the cycle. In addition to having the freshest 
possible food, there&rsquo;s an even better reason why we would want to do 
this. With food production moved underground, vast tracts of land currently 
used for agriculture would become available for other uses. Most could be 
landscaped and allowed to go wild, and the rest could be made available for 
spacious suburbs. Without agriculture using-up the best land, Earth would no 
longer seem crowded.</p> 
<p>(2) No matter how comfortable Earth becomes, many people will want the 
special luxuries found in space colonies. Imagine a tin can 50 miles long and 
20 miles in diameter, spinning on its axis to create pseudo-gravity. Its 3,000 
square miles of inner surface would be sculpted into cities, parks, lakes and 
wilderness areas. With a population density of only 1,000 per square mile it 
would comfortably house three million people. Standing on the inside and 
looking up, the entire living surface would be spread across the sky (20 miles 
away), and at night the porch lights of a million homes would shine in the sky 
like stars. With panoramic skies, mild weather, zero-gravity play areas, and 
low-gravity housing for the elderly, space colonies would be popular among all 
age groups.</p> 
<p>Imagine a giant frame in space where thousands of colonies can be joined 
together with a mass transit system. Take the bus from colony to colony. With 
endless variations of climate, vegetation, and design, travel could become the 
main activity of the future population.</p> 
<p>With ample resources available, engineers would make space colonies safe 
from collisions and radiation, and without earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, 
tornadoes, or hurricanes they&rsquo;d be safer than Earth. Space colonies would 
roll off the assembly line faster than we could fill them.</p> 
<p>Ganymede, one of the moons of Jupiter, is much more massive than our moon 
and is covered by more than one hundred miles of frozen water. In one scenario, 
mining Ganymede alone would provide enough space colonies for a human 
population of a thousand trillion wealthy people. That would delay the 
population crisis for another 1000 years.</p>

<h2>The World&rsquo;s Energy Future [Still] Belongs in Space by Dr. Gerard 
K.&nbsp;O&rsquo;Neill</h2>

<p>Solar Power Satellites are a solution to both global energy needs and to 
the greenhouse gas problem. The primary obstacle is the enormous lift costs. A 
cheaper source of construction materials than Earth must be found.</p> 
<p>Editor&rsquo;s note: Published more than 15 years ago, this essay is even 
more true and urgent today, and guides the philosophy and actions of Space 
Studies Institute. This very slightly UPdated version now includes selected 
illustrations from SSI&rsquo;s free-to-copy sample slides, the Solar Power 
Satellite art set.</p> 
<p>Trilogy January/February 1992</p> 
<p>One of the great phenomena of our times is the environmental movement. Like 
any popular, large-scale movement, it has its irresponsible fringes, but it is 
impressive not only for its power, but for the number of its thoughtful, 
reasoning supporters. And none too soon, because within the past half-century 
the growing world population&rsquo;s drive to industrialize has reached the 
point where human activity is clearly damaging the environment, in some cases 
irreversibly. Such damage is not unique to our own times; the deforestation of 
ancient Greece and much of Europe and Britain in the past few hundred years are 
examples. Now the damage has become general and worldwide.</p> 
<p>The first, and intellectually the simplest response to that damage was to 
cry &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The earliest, and still a popular theme was, &ldquo;If 
it&rsquo;s new technology or an expansion of old, stop it.&rdquo; We have, at 
least for now, effectively stopped the development of nuclear power in the 
United States. That happened because environmentalists feared reactor accidents 
and the certainty of nuclear wastes, and because of the mental association of 
&ldquo;nuclear&rdquo; with weapons. Though educated as a nuclear physicist, I 
happen to agree with that rejection, for specific reasons which seem rational 
to me.</p> 
<p>Successes like that, if such we call them, are isolated. France, a nation 
as advanced as our own and with its own strong environmental movement continues 
to rely overwhelmingly on nuclear power. In the past 70 years, the drive to 
industrialize was so strong in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union that 
environmental concerns were totally buried.</p> 
<p>Those examples point to worldwide forces that are, and probably always will 
remain, stronger by far than the forces allied for preservation of the Earth. 
Those forces are individuals aspirations for a better standard of living. In 
developing nations the paramount drive is feeding one&rsquo;s own family and 
improving, even a little, the conditions of life. The destruction of the 
Brazilian rain forest, over-grazing in Africa, and pollution in the majority of 
Third World cities all attest to what forces win out in places where the 
standard of living is still far below that achieved in Europe, Japan, and the 
United States.</p> 
<p>How can we solve the problem? Even to suggest there may be solutions is a 
&ldquo;Western&rdquo; viewpoint, very different from the fatalism much of 
humankind still lives by. But it is the material results of that Western 
viewpoint which most of humankind is striving to achieve.</p> 
<p>I find myself trying hard, as a human being first and a scientist second, 
to find solutions. For years I have been exploring practical ways to preserve 
or even improve the environment while at the same time making available to the 
people of the developing nations the material resources they so desperately 
want.</p> 
<p>The Link Between Energy and Industrialization</p> 
<p>The central problem of industrial growth is energy. Building more energy 
efficient systems, especially transportation systems, is a way we can reduce 
energy needs. Much of my current efforts focus on the design of a practical 
transport system which can be faster than the Concorde, is virtually free of 
noise and environmental impact, and uses less than five times the energy as an 
efficient car, train, or airplane: vehicles traveling at or near surface level 
in a vacuum, supported and driven by magnetic forces, and guided by computers.
</p> 
<p>Despite such examples, reducing energy use overall is not an option, 
because producing most foods, goods, and services depends on energy. The 
least-developed industrial nations use only a hundredth as much energy as the 
most developed &ndash; but they suffer a living standard a hundred times lower 
in consequence. We could not reduce energy use without condemning the majority 
of the world&rsquo;s population to unending poverty.</p> 
<p>Maintaining the present rate of energy growth in developing nations will 
require generating more than five times today&rsquo;s energy production 50 
years from now [UPdate: 35 and counting]. It is so difficult and challenging to 
do that in an environmentally benign way that we must begin by throwing out 
most of the ideas we have heard so far.</p> 
<p>We are concerned enough with the rise of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse 
effect that our desire, as environmentalists, is to phase out the use of fossil 
fuels. That can be done, even for road transportation, if electricity can be 
made cheaply enough. Fuels like methane, propane, and butane can be synthesized 
using recycled carbon dioxide to put energy into portable form.</p> 
<p>But how do we generate energy cheaply, reliably, without significant 
environmental impact, and without danger? Nuclear power is not very cheap, and 
would require operating 63,000 nuclear reactors worldwide by the middle of the 
next century. Reactors concentrate energy to an extreme degree, which is why 
there have been fatal reactor accidents in the real world of fallible, 
error-prone people.</p> 
<p>Solar power received at ground level cannot be converted to energy in the 
amounts needed without paving much of the world with solar cells. That would 
further raise the Earth&rsquo;s temperature by increasing the heat the ground 
absorbs. Obtaining power from the temperature difference between surface and 
deep ocean waters in the tropical oceans would change the global climate 
profoundly by altering the heat balance at the ocean&rsquo;s surface. Fusion 
power appears still far from realization, and would not be free of 
radioactivity.</p> 
<p>When conventional ideas are exhausted and no solution has been found, it is 
often wise to examine whether we have, unknowingly, bound our own thinking by 
convention. In this case we have, because all of the usual answers concerning 
generating energy are bound by our unspoken limitation to the surface of the 
Earth. I like to illustrate that tradition-bound thinking by posing the 
six-match puzzle. Put six matches on a table, do not break any, and use them to 
make four equal triangles. People who attempt the puzzle usually push the 
matches about the table for awhile and then give up. The solution is simple: 
make an equal-sided triangle of three matches, and hold a new match at each 
point of the triangle with the other ends of those last three matches meeting 
above the table. You have made a perfect tetrahedron &ndash; and you have 
escaped two-dimensional thinking to find a solution in three.</p> 
<p>Letting The Sun Shine In</p> 
<p>By close analogy, the probable best solution to our energy problem is to 
use the third dimension. There is, already, an utterly reliable, 
maintenance-free, nuclear reactor that consumes its own wastes &ndash; the sun. 
Everywhere except where the Earth&rsquo;s shadow interrupts it, sunlight is 
intense and reliable 24 hours a day; everywhere, except where we have tried to 
use it so far.</p> 
<p>There is a way to use the clean solar energy that now streams by the Earth 
to lose itself in the depths of space. It does not require new science, nor 
high temperatures, nor high energy density. It is simply to locate, in high 
orbit, large arrays of solar panels. Those panels convert solar energy to 
electricity, and then to low-density radio waves. The waves are sent to 
fenced-off areas on Earth where they are converted back to electricity at an 
efficiency rate of more than 90 percent.</p> 
<p>To make solar power satellites (SPS) practical and economical, we do not 
need any new science; we only need to apply what we are already doing in the 
more advanced industries: robotic production, computer control, and the 
replication by robotic machines of some of their heavier, simpler components. 
We do need one more thing: materials. It is neither practical. nor economical, 
nor environmentally acceptable to lift from the Earth by rockets the thousands 
of tons of materials needed to build an SPS that would supply Earth electricity 
equal to the output of ten nuclear power plants.</p> 
<p>Let the Moon Pitch In</p> 
<p>Fortunately, we do not have to. We were given something unique in our solar 
system: an enormous moon, orbiting tantalizingly nearby, and containing on its 
surface just the materials we need. Lunar soils contain 20 percent silicon for 
solar cells, and about 20 percent metals. Much of the rest, surprisingly 
enough, is oxygen. The moon has two other great advantages as a source of 
materials: its gravitational pull is only one-sixth of the Earth&rsquo;s, and 
because of its small diameter, the moon&rsquo;s gravitational grip is less than 
a twentieth of the Earth&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>The moon&rsquo;s second advantage is it has no atmosphere. The combination 
of the moon&rsquo;s weak gravitational grip and its vacuum environment makes it 
practical to locate electric mass accelerators on its surface which would be 
capable of lofting a steady stream of small payloads to a precise collection 
point high in space.</p> 
<p>Such machines, called &ldquo;mass-drivers,&rdquo; were tested nearly a 
decade ago under the sponsorship of our small, quiet, nonprofit foundation, the 
Space Studies Institute (SSI). Mass-drivers were shown to obey their computer 
design programs within one percent &ndash; no new science there &ndash; just 
straightforward engineering. Since then SSI has sponsored laboratory research 
on making useful products from ores similar to lunar soils.</p> 
<p>Can SPS Technology Deliver?</p> 
<p>As people concerned about our environment and about the world we leave to 
our children we should question proposed solutions to major physical problems. 
As fossil fuels, nuclear energy, ground-based solar, and other conventional 
sources of energy all fail to make sense in the world.</p> 
<p>First of all, there is plenty of energy in space. Even in a narrow band 
25,000 miles above the equator, where a satellite can maintain a fixed orbit, 
plenty of solar energy streams by constantly to supply far more than enough 
energy for the Earth of 2050.</p> 
<p>What of the conversion on Earth? It was demonstrated years ago. The 
antennas convert the radio waves with an efficiency so high that less than 100 
watts of waste heat goes into the environment for every 1,000 watts that goes 
into power lines. For coal or nuclear the numbers are: 1,500 watts waste, 2,500 
watts total; for ground-based solar they are several thousand watts waste plus 
another thousand to make up the total &ndash; different from an Earth without 
solar cells &ndash; because solar cells absorb more heat than the ground they 
cover.</p> 
<p>Transmission is the question that deserves continuing research: How to send 
the low-density radio waves from an SPS to antennas on the Earth. I have 
satisfied myself that transmission does not involve significant risks. But I 
invite you to do your own research. One of the best sources on the subject is 
The Microwave Debate by N.H. Steneck (MIT Press).</p> 
<p>The points that seem to me most important about radio transmission of 
energy are that people would not be in the beams; that for fundamental physical 
reasons the beams could not be intentionally or accidentally redirected; that 
their intensity would be comparable to sunlight; that unlike the massive 
shielding around a nuclear reactor, the only shielding necessary would be a 
layer of household aluminum foil; and that, unlike the present irreversible 
dumping of 5,000 megatons per year of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere, or the generation of long-lived nuclear wastes, the SPS system 
would leave no chemicals or radioactives behind if our descendants decided to 
turn it off.</p> 
<p>SPS Stuck in Bureaucratic Morass</p> 
<p>You and I know that satellite power aided by the use of construction 
materials from the lunar surface is an idea that is still almost unheard of, 
much less the subject of national debate, as it should be. Indeed, those most 
seriously studying SPS are Japan and Europe. Why does this conspiracy of 
silence exist? The reasons are partly unfamiliarity: three-dimensional thinking 
is often unwelcome in a two-dimensional world. Oddly enough, it is often more 
unwelcome to people who think of themselves as experts than to people who have 
a general, rather than a specialized education.</p> 
<p>Institutional barriers and the normal behavior patterns of bureaucracies 
explain the rest of the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Since shortly after World War II the 
generation of scientists who contributed so greatly to winning that war have 
championed nuclear power. Though that generation is well into retirement now, 
it remains a powerful force in advising the government. It is joined by the 
heavy industries which see (or used to see) nuclear power as a market 
opportunity.</p> 
<p>Fusion power research has gone on in large part because governmental 
science agencies like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the 
Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation are extremely 
responsive to the scientific establishment. That establishment is led by such 
organizations as the National Academy of Sciences. The academy is made up of 
intelligent and highly qualified scientists, but as a body it is very 
conservative. Indeed, one of my colleagues high in its councils once described 
it as an &ldquo;Old Men&rsquo;s Club.&rdquo; Fusion power research has been 
supported for some 40 years because, literally, generations of scientists have 
worked on it as graduate students, then gone on to positions of authority, and 
finally risen to positions where their recommendations arc heard with respect 
by government agencies.</p> 
<p>In the bureaucratic format, satellite power has no natural home and no 
built-in constituency. NASA, now a timid, fearful NASA made up of aging 
pre-retirees rather than the young tigers who made Apollo work in just eight 
years, would be frightened out of its skin by a tough, make-it-work assignment 
with a tight budget and a tighter time scale. And NASA&rsquo;s charter 
doesn&rsquo;t cover energy. The DOE? Its charter doesn&rsquo;t include space. 
The NSF? Satellite power isn&rsquo;t science, it&rsquo;s engineering.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why research support toward satellite power has been left 
largely to the Space Studies Institute, a small foundation supported by 
thousands of private citizens -much as the organizations of the environmental 
movement are supported. Environmentally concerned citizens and groups, and SSI, 
should be talking. Their concerns are the same and their goals are the same. 
Since the governmental-scientific establishment in the United States is making 
no useful move toward a serious review of satellite power as a practical 
alternative, it may well be that concerned citizens are the only force that can 
bring about the necessary action. We as citizens have often succeeded in 
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; actions. Let us review, carefully and with open minds, 
whether SPS is something that we may want to &ldquo;Start!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A NaturalNews Special Report by Mike Adams<br>
</p> 
<p>Physicians rarely promote the curative properties of H2O, but Dr. 
Batmanghelidj, M.D. has studied water&rsquo;s effect on the human body and has 
found it to be one of the best pain relievers and preventative therapies in 
existence. I was one of the last people to interview the late Dr. 
Batmanghelidj, and I listened in awe as he shared his research and stories 
about &ldquo;The Healing Power of Water.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In a fascinating one-hour phone conversation, Dr. B. shares:</p> 
<p>&bull; Which common ailments and &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; are actually caused 
by dehydration</p> 
<p>&bull; Why many doctors use water-regulating antihistamines to alleviate 
pain</p> 
<p>&bull; How Dr. Batmanghelidj unintentionally discovered water&rsquo;s 
healing properties</p> 
<p>&bull; Why most people are chronically dehydrated and suffer from symptoms 
of dehydration that are labeled &ldquo;diseases&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&bull; Which ingredients in soft drinks deplete the body&rsquo;s water 
reserves</p> 
<p>&bull; Why thirst is not a reliable indicator of dehydration</p> 
<p>&bull; Why the body produces cholesterol and how water keeps it in balance
</p> 
<p>&bull; Why Dr. Batmanghelidj believes the public is being mislead about AIDS
</p> 
<p>&bull; How dehydration impairs mental functioning</p> 
<p>&bull; Why some organizations want to withhold alternative health 
information from the public</p> 
<p>&bull; How lack of water causes depression</p> 
<p>&bull; Why popular beverages are no substitute for water</p> 
<p>&bull; How dehydration causes the vascular system to constrict, leading to 
hypertension</p> 
<p>&bull; How to recognize signs that your body is starting to dehydrate</p> 
<p>&bull; Why restaurants push you to drink disease-promoting soft drinks</p> 
<p>&bull; Why and how water effectively treats pain and inflammation</p> 
<h1>Discovery of the water cure</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Welcome everyone, this is Mike Adams with Truth 
Publishing, and today I&rsquo;m very excited to be welcoming Dr. Batmanghelidj, 
author of Water For Health, For Healing, For Life. Welcome, Dr. Batmanghelidj.
</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Thank you very much for inviting me to be on the 
air with you and giving me the opportunity of sharing my thoughts on the future 
of medicine in this country.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I think there are many, many people who have read 
your books. People are intrigued by the idea that water can be a therapy, a 
healing substance for the human body. What is it about water? How did you first 
become aware of these healing properties of water?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s very bizarre. As you know, 
I&rsquo;m a regular doctor, an M.D. I had the honor and the privilege of being 
selected as one of the house doctors, and I had the extreme honor of being one 
of the last students of Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. I 
mention his name so that you know I was immersed in medical school and 
research. And some years later, I had to give two glasses of water to a person 
who was doubled up in abdominal pain from his disease, because I had no other 
medication to give him at that moment. And he was in excruciating pain, and 
water performed miraculous relief for him. It gave him relief &mdash; within 
three minutes his pain diminished, and within eight minutes it disappeared 
completely, whereas he was doubled up eight minutes before and he 
couldn&rsquo;t even walk, he completely recovered from that situation. And he 
started beaming from ear to ear, very happy, asked me what happens if the pain 
comes back? I said, &ldquo;Well, drink more water.&rdquo; Then I decided to 
instruct him to drink two glasses of water every three hours. Which he did, and 
that was the end of his ulcer pains for the rest of the duration that he was 
with me.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> And from that episode then, what happened next?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> That woke me up, because in medical school 
I&rsquo;d never heard that water could cure pain, that kind of pain, in fact. 
And so I had the occasion to test water as a medication in subsequently over 
3,000 similar cases. And water proved every time to be an effective medication. 
I came away from that experience with the understanding that these people were 
all thirsty, and that thirst in the body can manifest itself in the form of 
abdominal pain to the level that the person can even become semi-conscious, 
because that&rsquo;s the experience I had. And water picks them up every time.
</p> 
<p>So when I came to America in 1982, I went to the University of 
Pennsylvania, where I was invited to continue my research, and did research in 
the pain-relieving properties of water. I asked myself, why does the 
pharmaceutical industry insist on using antihistamines for this kind of pain 
medication? So I started researching the role of histamine in the body, and the 
answer was there &mdash; histamine is a neurotransmitter in charge of water 
regulation and the drought management programs of the body. When it manifests 
pain, in fact, it is indicating dehydration.</p> 
<p>So, the body does manifest dehydration in the form of pain. Now, depending 
on where dehydration is settled, you feel pain there. Very simple, and I 
presented this concept at the international conference as the guest lecturer of 
a conference on cancer, explaining that the human body manifests dehydration by 
producing pain, and pain is a sign of water shortage in the body, and water 
shortage is actually the background to most of the health problems in our 
society.</p> 
<p>Because if you look at what the pharmaceutical industry is doing, 
they&rsquo;re producing so many different antihistamines as medication. 
Antidepressant drugs are antihistamines, pain medication are antihistamines, 
other medications are directly and indirectly antihistamines. So, that is when 
my work was published, the scientific secretariat of the 3rd Interscience Board 
Conference of Inflammation invited me to make this presentation on histamine at 
their conference in 1989, in Monte Carlo. And I did that, and so it became a 
regular understanding that histamine is a water regulator in the body. But 
unfortunately, this information is not reaching the public through the medical 
community because it&rsquo;s not a money-maker.</p> 
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I began to consider writing for the public, so that 
the public could become aware of the problem directly without the interference 
of a doctor, and that&rsquo;s how I have generated all my medical information 
for the public. Of course, I have published extensively for the scientific 
community, but no one is picking up. In fact, the NIH, the Office of 
Alternative Medicine, had its first conference when the office was created, and 
I was asked to make my presentation, but when the proceedings of the conference 
came out, my presentation was censored after the proceedings. So there is a 
movement afoot within the NIH group of people to keep a closed lid on my 
information so that it doesn&rsquo;t get out, because obviously they are more 
in favor of the drug industry, because it is now obvious that they are getting 
paid by them.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I think it is, first of all, that is an amazing 
account of what has been happening, and I think it is fair to say, too, that 
the pharmaceutical industry and organized medicine in general, really 
doesn&rsquo;t want to promote anything that is free or near-free to the average 
patient. Sunlight is available at no charge, water is available at nearly no 
charge &mdash; would you agree that their thinking is if people can cure their 
diseases, and achieve a high state of health on their own with these free 
substances, then that diminishes their profits and their importance?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Absolutely. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve created an 
organization now called National Association for Honesty in Medicine. Because I 
think it&rsquo;s totally dishonest, in fact, criminal, to treat a person who is 
just thirsty, and give them toxic medication so that he gets sick and dies 
earlier than normal.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Can you give out the web address to that 
organization, by the way?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> My website is http://www.watercure.com &mdash; it 
gives you the option of going to one site or the other &mdash; either Water 
Cure.com, or you can go the National Association for Honesty in Medicine. Or 
you can go to the information side of my website,http://www.watercure.com, 
because I have posted all of my scientific articles on dehydration on the 
website, and lots of other free information that people can have.</p> 
<h1>AIDS and the Pharmaceutical Industry</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I want to applaud what I call your scientific 
curiosity. I think this is the kind of curiosity that has been lost in so much 
of western medicine, where a true scientist observes nature and observes the 
interaction between humans and nature, and remains curious and open and to all 
possibilities, and then forms conclusions after rigorous testing, and I think 
so much of modern science has drawn erroneous conclusions without really 
remaining open-minded&hellip;</p> 
<p>Dr B: Yes, one of the worst ones is AIDS. Because everyone assumes that 
AIDS is actually a viral disease, which is a fraudulent statement by those 
people who presented it, because the human body is the product of many, many 
years of having fought various viral diseases, and has survived. Smallpox, 
polio, measles, and all the other viruses that can kill very easily, and the 
body has an ability to mount a defense system against these hot viruses, 
viruses that actually very quickly can kill. But having survived those, how is 
it possible that the slow virus would kill us in the name of AIDS? I 
can&rsquo;t understand it.</p> 
<p>I have researched this topic extensively, and I have shown in fact that 
AIDS is a metabolic problem, when the body begins to cannibalize its own tissue 
because of certain missing elements in the raw materials that it receives 
through food or beverages, and the body of a person who gets AIDS, actually, is 
short of quite a number of building block amino acids. They&rsquo;re short of 
tyrosine, they&rsquo;re short of methionine, cysteine, they&rsquo;re short of 
histidine, and they&rsquo;ve got a whole lot of others in excess. So how can we 
expect a body that depends on the other amino acids to survive?</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Once again we see AIDS is a huge industry for the 
pharmaceutical industry.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Well, of course it is, and the whole entire 
existence of the pharmaceutical industry is based on presentation of false 
science, and advertising this false science and drumming it into the minds of 
gullible people who have no curiosity to find out why that is so.</p> 
<h1>Cholesterol</h1> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Another false science is the question of 
cholesterol. Cholesterol is one of the most essential elements in the survival 
of the human body. When the body begins to make more cholesterol, it has a 
reason to do that. It is certainly not to block the arteries of the heart, 
because we measure the level of cholesterol in the body in the blood we take 
out of the veins of the body, and nowhere in the history of medicine is there 
recorded one single case of cholesterol ever having blocked the veins of the 
body.</p> 
<p>So, it is not the stickiness of the cholesterol that is the problem, which 
the drug industry is drumming it into the minds of people &mdash; cholesterol 
is sticky, reduce it otherwise you will have blockage of your arteries, which 
is all nonsense. Cholesterol is actually saving the lives of people, because 
cholesterol is a bandage, a waterproof bandage that the body has designed. When 
the blood becomes concentrated and acidic, and is being rushed through 
constricted arteries or capillaries, in dehydration, then abrasions and tears 
are produced in the arterial system, naturally, in the capillaries of the heart 
first.</p> 
<p>Now if cholesterol wasn&rsquo;t there to cover up the tear and abrasions, 
blood would get under the membrane and peel it off and that person would be 
dead instantly. Cholesterol is actually an interim lifesaver, giving the body 
time to recover from its problems. We never understood this. We are knee-jerk 
doctors. We think that something&rsquo;s up, bring it down, if 
something&rsquo;s down, bring it up. We don&rsquo;t ask questions why is it 
down or why is it up?</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> And the pharmaceutical companies know that treating 
cholesterol is a huge industry&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> It&rsquo;s a ten-billion dollar industry. Now there 
is a report that actually these statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs produce 
amnesia. In other words, the brain totally loses track of what it&rsquo;s 
doing, and it is published by a doctor who is an eminent doctor. He was a 
flight surgeon, he is a researcher at NASA. And he knows what he&rsquo;s 
talking about. He had the problem himself.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I just wanted to comment on the number of side 
effects that have been recorded as side effects from using statin drugs. Some 
people have extreme muscular pain, that amnesia you mentioned seems to be very 
common, and yet a study just came out, I saw it this morning, talking about how 
blueberries have phytonutrients that are shown to lower so-called fatty 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, more powerfully than statin drugs.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> It&rsquo;s interesting, because you see, the body 
manufactures cholesterol as an emergency situation, when it raises the level of 
its production. Its normal rate of production is of course is to create 
membranes for the cell membranes and brain cells and nerve insulation and of 
course the hormones of the body, vitamin D for the body. So these are the 
essential components that cholesterol makes in the body. We should never 
interfere with cholesterol without knowing why the body has starting raising 
its level.</p> 
<h1>No substitute for water</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I have a question for you on water &mdash; a lot of 
people think that they are hydrating themselves when they consume soft drinks 
or milk or Gatorade or all these other liquid beverages&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Gatorade is possibly okay, but Gatorade has sugar 
in it, and it&rsquo;s not particularly good for people who might even get 
hypoglycemic, or might induce insulin secretion, and that insulin secretion 
will produce more hunger and they overeat. But as a temporary sport drink, 
it&rsquo;s okay when you&rsquo;re in the middle of a golf game to drink a 
Gatorade. It immediately gives you a bit of the minerals that you probably will 
have lost sweating.</p> 
<p>But nothing substitutes for water &mdash; not a thing. No drink &mdash; no 
coffee, no tea, no alcoholic beverages. Not even fruit juices. Each one of them 
has its own agenda. Your body is used to a fluid that has no agenda, because 
the body depends on the freedom of that fluid, water, because there are two 
kinds of water in the body. There is already occupied and engaged water, which 
is no good for new function. The body needs new water, or free water, to 
perform new functions. Now, when you give them sugar containing beverages, or 
caffeine containing beverages, both sugar and caffeine have their own chemical 
agenda in the body. They defeat the purpose of the need for water.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> You&rsquo;re also talking about soft drinks 
here&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> I&rsquo;m talking about soft drinks, I&rsquo;m 
talking about sodas, I&rsquo;m talking about caffeine containing coffee or tea. 
I&rsquo;m also talking about alcohol, because alcohol actually stops the 
emergency water supply systems to the important cells, such as the brain cells. 
In the reverse osmosis process your body filters and injects water into the 
cells, and this is what I call reverse osmosis. And it has to raise the blood 
pressure for that in order to overcome the osmotic pull of water out of the 
cells, and reinject water into the cells. That&rsquo;s why we develop 
high-blood pressure in dehydration. And this process of reverse osmosis is 
stopped by alcohol. It stops the filter system.</p> 
<h1>Chronic Disease Caused by Lack of Water</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Let me start this next section by asking you about 
the correlation between water consumption and chronic disease. There are many 
diseases you mention in your books that are related to dehydration. I wonder if 
you can give our readers a brief of what the major diseases are and why they 
are aggravated or promoted by chronic dehydration.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Certainly, Mike. I have written a book called Water 
Cures and Drugs Kill. It&rsquo;s a book that explains why dehydration is the 
cause of pain and disease, and how the pharmaceutical industry has camouflaged 
this information or covered it up and instead of letting people drink water, it 
advertises the use of their products, which actually do kill. Because recent 
figures have shown that prescription medications, when used according to the 
instruction of doctors, nonetheless kill over 106,000 people, and make 2 
million people sicker than before taking the medication. And then there is 
another group who die from faulty prescriptions, incorrect prescriptions.</p> 
<p>So between them, about 250,000 people die from drug-related problems, 
medication-related problems. This makes the drugs the use of drugs the number 
three killer processes in the country &mdash; protected and licensed killer 
process. After heart disease, which kills about seven or eight hundred 
thousand, cancer which kills about 500,000, drugs kill 250,000 people.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> So it&rsquo;s fair to say that pharmaceuticals, as 
packaged by modern medicine, are the third leading cause of death in this 
country.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Absolutely, and they are useless, because most of 
the medication they are using is to cover up symptoms and signs and 
complications of dehydration in the human body. The human body manifests 
dehydration by a series of symptoms and signs, perceptive symptoms of 
dehydration &mdash; in other words, brain senses dehydration, or tiredness when 
you haven&rsquo;t done a good day&rsquo;s work, or first thing in the morning 
when you want to get up out of bed and you&rsquo;re tired, you can&rsquo;t get 
up &mdash; that is a sign of dehydration. Then anger, quick reaction, 
depression, these are all signs of dehydration, when the brain has very little 
energy from hydroelectricity to cope with the information or take action. These 
are some of the perceptive signs of dehydration. Then the body has its drought 
management program, which are allergies, hypertension, diabetes, and also 
immune diseases.</p> 
<h1>The link between dehydration and asthma</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I&rsquo;d like you to elaborate a little more on 
asthma, and the idea that the body is managing its water supply deliberately in 
a way that produces symptoms that are called asthma.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Yes, well you see, drought management means that 
you have to clog the holes where water is lost from the body. Water is the most 
precious commodity in the interior of your body, and when not enough is coming 
in and more is being lost, this is a no-no situation for your body. The 
intelligence behind the design of the body has it such that a drought 
management program will kick in, and then allergies are a sign of dehydration 
because the system that regulates water balance of the body suppresses the 
immune system, because it&rsquo;s an energy-consuming situation. Then you get 
asthma.</p> 
<p>You see, we lose about a quart of water through breathing every day. It is 
actually the surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs that produces 
contraction of these tiny membranes, and air is pushed out. And in the process, 
that water will leave with the air that is leaving. So you lose about a quart 
of water in breathing. We need to replenish that. When we don&rsquo;t replenish 
it, the body tightens up the bronchials and plugs up the holes and we call this 
reduced air flow in the lungs because of dehydration, we&rsquo;ve labeled it as 
asthma.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right. I&rsquo;ve always been amazed that the 
willingness of modern medicine or western medicine to come up with these 
complicated sounding labels or names for diseases that should really have 
simpler names.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Jargon peddling is the way of commercial medicine. 
Sick-care system survives and thrives on pushing these jargons into the minds 
of the people, because people don&rsquo;t understand what these jargons, they 
hear them and they don&rsquo;t associate with anything in the body, but 
associate them with those jargons of fear that are drummed in the minds of 
people.</p> 
<p>Now, children, there are 17 million children in America, probably more 
because the numbers rise every year, who have asthma, and the reason is, at the 
same time, children have been consuming more and more sodas. Three year olds to 
five year olds have been consuming three times as much soda in the last ten 
years than in the ten years before that. So these people are getting 
dehydrated, they are consuming more sodas, which doesn&rsquo;t function in the 
same way as water, and that is why they get asthma. Now, give these children 
water, and their asthma will disappear very quickly, in a matter of a few 
hours, completely the breathing becomes normal. The need for these inhalers 
will disappear.</p> 
<p>And when I contacted the NIH and explained all of this, the gentleman who 
was in charge of this said I was so ignorant on what was going on, and yet he 
wanted to protect his freedom, and so he ignored the information even though I 
had gone to Clinton, President Clinton to ask him to intervene, and give breath 
back to these children. But the NIH was adamant to use medication. He wrote me, 
actually, and said we are satisfied with the way asthma is being treated. So, 
this is the situation. Now 17 million children is America can recover in a 
matter of a few days if everyone in the country started talking to asthmatic 
people and saying water is what you should take. Can you imagine a solution so 
simple?</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes. Yes I can, and there are many such solutions 
available to treat a great number of chronic diseases, just like you&rsquo;ve 
been describing here. Of course, the pharmaceutical industry I think would be 
horrified to have that information become widespread.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Yeah, well, because what I&rsquo;m saying is 
totally anti-business, and we are not talking about a few hundred thousand 
dollars, we are talking about a few billion dollars a year.</p> 
<h1>Treating hypertension with water</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> For the pharmaceutical industry, the existence of 
disease is a business question, because let&rsquo;s face it, the pharmaceutical 
industry is a for-profit industry. Profits are always first, and at least 
it&rsquo;s my belief, and it seems that you share it, that any therapy that 
competes with those profits is minimized, marginalized or outright attacked.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Yes, recently there was an ad on the television. It 
was very interesting &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the beginning, but I 
now realize that the ad was speaking to me. In other words, it was an ad 
against my statements. Because I&rsquo;ve said that the heartburn is a sign of 
dehydration in the human body and you should drink water. And this guy comes 
and sits at the counter and asks, &ldquo;Give me a glass of water, my heartburn 
is killing me.&rdquo; Or something like that. And the lady behind the counter 
says, &ldquo;Water doesn&rsquo;t cure heartburn &mdash; this medication 
does.&rdquo; So see, this is how the pharmaceutical industry fights the 
information that I put out. But nonetheless, people who did discover that water 
could cure their heartburn are wiser than those who buy into that advertising 
stunt.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> It seems like there are almost two different groups 
of people in the United States. There are those who are now dependent on 
multiple pharmaceuticals to treat everything, every symptom that they have, and 
who alter their body chemistry and their brain chemistry through drugs, and 
then there are those who are educating themselves about the true causes of 
health. They&rsquo;re drinking water, they&rsquo;re avoiding food additives, 
they&rsquo;re engaging in exercise &mdash; it seems like there&rsquo;s a chasm 
that&rsquo;s widening between these two groups.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Absolutely. That&rsquo;s why alternative medicine 
has picked up and you&rsquo;re getting more people going to alternative 
medicine than conventional medicine. You see, I&rsquo;ve sold at least over 
600,000 copies of my book Your Body&rsquo;s Many Cries for Water over the past 
10 years. And so I&rsquo;ve had over several thousand radio interviews in the 
past 10 years. Information is getting out into the hands of the public, so the 
pharmaceutical industry has to naturally increase its advertising to nullify 
this information that I have put out. That is why they have produced this ad 
&mdash; one of many, actually.</p> 
<p>Anyway, we were talking about drought management programs in the body. 
Hypertension is another one of these problems. When there isn&rsquo;t enough 
water in the body, or the body becomes dehydrated, 66% of the water loss is 
from the interior of the cells. 26% is from the environment around the cells, 
and only 8% is lost from the vascular system. But the vascular system is an 
elastic system &mdash; it tightens up and takes up the slack so you don&rsquo;t 
see the problem that is going on inside the cells of your body by testing your 
blood that is being tested in so many conditions. If people drank water on a 
regular basis and took enough salt and minerals to expand the capillary beds, 
hypertension would disappear completely.</p> 
<p>And there are 60 million Americans who don&rsquo;t realize that actually 
hypertension is one of the manifestations of drought management programs of the 
body when the body begins to operate a reverse osmosis process, to deliver 
water into the interior of those cells which are 66% water deficient. Now the 
pharmaceutical industry and the medical doctors arrogantly and ignorantly are 
treating hypertension with diuretics.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Let&rsquo;s get rid of the water!</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> They are getting rid of the water in the body, at a 
lot of, how shall I say, effort.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Isn&rsquo;t this an example of the arrogance of 
modern medicine in believing that it knows more than nature, it knows more than 
the body?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> We, as doctors, are really 007 agents of the 
pharmaceutical industry. We are totally blind and ignorant and the 
pharmaceutical industry has hijacked medicine. We learn a couple of years of 
physiology, and soon as we go on the clinical side we are asked to forget those 
and begin to learn pharmacology in order to treat symptoms rather than 
understand the primary cause of the health problem.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> But you were trained in classic, conventional 
way&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> I had to educate myself.</p> 
<h1>Thinking outside the box</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> What it is that drove you to explore beyond the 
limited thinking of conventional medicine?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> I&rsquo;m always a curious person. I&rsquo;ve been 
a curious person ever since I was born as far as I know. One day we had a thief 
come into the house and was on the wall, and I was only a two and a half year 
old boy. I went to him and said, &ldquo;What are you doing here? Can&rsquo;t 
you see you&rsquo;re scaring everyone? Why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo; I 
wasn&rsquo;t scared, I was curious.</p> 
<p>That is what I am, right throughout my life, and that is why when I 
discovered that water cures pain, then this was an entrance for me to get into 
it and find out what was the reason. And that was when I discovered that my 
education was no good. I didn&rsquo;t learn medicine, I learned a little bit of 
anatomy and a little bit of histology, which stood me in good stead in order to 
understand the rest of the stuff.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> You are, I&rsquo;m sure the listeners would agree 
here, you are to be applauded for being able to venture outside of conventional 
medicine.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> I&rsquo;m only a healer because that&rsquo;s my way 
of thinking. I don&rsquo;t think about money, because money is, if you do a 
good deed, money will come as a by product of that good deed.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I agree with you wholeheartedly there.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> You don&rsquo;t have to try and take the last drop 
of blood out of a person who comes to you in order to get help from you. That 
is against my nature. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve put out my information for 
everyone to use on the internet, and it is only for further use or further 
education that I have produced my books and so on, and those books 
unfortunately, the cost of printing, distribution, forces the price on the 
information. If the pharmaceutical industry had the information that they were 
going to sell, for example the information in my book Your Body&rsquo;s Many 
Cries For Water, they would ask for $10,000 a book, not $14.95.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> And, if they could, they would patent water&hellip;
</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> They would patent it.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> And try to sell it to you at $100 a dose, right?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> That&rsquo;s right. So, basically, this is 
what&rsquo;s going on in medicine in America. Joint pain, back pain, arthritis 
cause by chronic dehydration Dr. B.: The human body also has its emergency 
calls for water. These are localized emergency calls. We call these heartburn, 
rheumatoid joint pain, back pain, migraine headaches, colitis pain, 
fibromyalgiac pain, even angina pain &mdash; signs of dehydration in the body.
</p> 
<p>And the mechanism is very simple &mdash; when there isn&rsquo;t enough 
water to be evenly distributed and certain parts of the body are working but 
not receiving enough water to deal with its toxic waste and metabolism, and the 
toxic waste builds up that area, the nerve endings in that area register the 
chemical environmental change with the brain. And the brain translates this 
information for the conscious mind in the form of pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> So it&rsquo;s just the interpretation?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> It&rsquo;s an interpretation, yes. So the conscious 
mind gets the information that, hey, this area we can&rsquo;t use anymore, it 
has a shortage of water. Of course, the conscious mind should have known that, 
but bad education has robbed us of that information. We think this pain is a 
disease.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> The predominant diagnosis of this, of course, I 
think in the minds of most people, and especially in most M.D.s would be that 
there is something physically or structurally compromised in that area.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Well, of course, the compromise is when the tissue 
is dehydrated, it&rsquo;s changing structure. The plum-like cells become 
prune-like. Prune-like cells do not function in the same manners as a plum-like 
cell. So, that is how symptoms are produced. These symptoms mean, okay, let us 
get the ingredients that the body needs into the system. Now, when we say 
dehydration, water also brings a lot of other goodies to the cells. When we are 
dehydrated, these goodies are not delivered either. So, we need not only 
correct dehydration, but also to supply the minerals and vitamins and so on so 
that the body can repair itself.</p> 
<h1>Thirst perception not reliable</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I&rsquo;d like to you talk about how people can know 
when they need to drink water, because you talk about in the book how some of 
the signs of dehydration, the classic signs are not necessarily the only signs, 
and also how much should an average person be drinking?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> First and foremost, don&rsquo;t wait until you get 
thirsty, because that&rsquo;s an error. Unfortunately, the National Academy of 
Sciences and some other people recently have been telling people to wait until 
they get thirsty before they drink, which is the main error that we inherited 
100 years ago from a man called Walter Bradford Cannon. And that&rsquo;s why, 
at the time, there was a Frenchman saying that dehydration or thirst is a 
general sensation and we should study it, and Walter Bradford Cannon said, no, 
thirst is only a matter of dry mouth.</p> 
<p>When the mouth is dry we are thirsty, which is an arrogant statement, and 
unfortunately western medicine bought into that understanding, and that&rsquo;s 
why we have a sick-care system, because from the age of 20 onwards, we 
gradually, imperceptibly become dehydrated without knowing it. We lose our 
perception of thirst. By the age of 70 we may be totally thirsty and obviously 
thirsty and yet not recognize the need to drink water, even when water is put 
next to us.</p> 
<p>This was done as an experiment. A scientist asked a group of elderly people 
to withhold from drinking water for 24 hours, and similarly with young people. 
After 24 hours when water was made available, the elderly did not recognize 
that they were thirsty.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Even after 24 hours with no water?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Correct. Even when water was left next to them, 
some of them wouldn&rsquo;t reach for it. But the young people drank water, and 
corrected this dehydration. Now, this is a major problem, and that&rsquo;s why 
we have so many people in the elderly sector of our society who are sick, 
because they are totally dehydrated and they do not recognize it.</p> 
<p>So, waiting to get thirsty is to die prematurely and very painfully. In 
fact, this is the title of an article that is posted on my website,
www.WaterCure.com, and also on NAFHIM, National Association For Honesty In 
Medicine (http://www.nafhim.org).</p> 
<p>We should not wait to get thirsty, because water is the main source of 
energy. By the time you get thirsty, you will have lost energy from the water 
that you should have drunk and made available before you get thirsty. So, if 
you don&rsquo;t allow the gas tank of your car to come dry before you stop and 
take some gas, then why should you let your body become thirsty so that it 
stalls on the roadside before you drink water?</p> 
<p>So, first thing, people should never allow themselves to get thirsty 
&mdash; they should drink throughout the day. An average person needs two 
quarts of water a day. Average person really needs four quarts of water a day. 
But two quarts we have to supply. Two quarts we get from food metabolism and 
water content in foods. We need this amount of water to manufacture at least 
two quarts of urine. You know, not to put pressure on the kidneys. When we 
drink enough water so that the urine is colorless, that is a good sign. When 
the urine becomes yellow, it means that the body is beginning to become 
dehydrated and when it becomes orange, then the body is truly dehydrated and 
some part of the body is suffering from that dehydration.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> So this is a very easy sign that people can pay 
attention to.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Absolutely.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> They don&rsquo;t need a medical degree to see the 
color of their urine.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Well, that&rsquo;s why we should become observant 
to our urine production. And breathing &mdash; when we are short of breath, it 
means we are dehydrated.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Are there other similar, simple symptoms that people 
can pay attention to?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> The skin &mdash; if the skin is nice and loose and 
smooth, then we are hydrated. If it becomes creasy and shriveled, it means 
dehydration. The crow&rsquo;s feet on the face of elderly people, that&rsquo;s 
a sign of dehydration. The turkey neck under the chin is a sign of dehydration. 
These are mentioned in my books, Your Body&rsquo;s Many Cries for Water, and 
also in my Water For Health, For Healing, For Life. I recommend everyone to 
read Water Cures, Drugs Kill, because in this book I&rsquo;ve identified over 
90 health problems that we in medicine have called disease, and yet water cures 
them.</p> 
<p>So, when the body is short of water and they give it medication, naturally 
the person will die, because the medication is silencing the many cries of the 
body for water. But it&rsquo;s not correcting the dehydration. So we need to 
understand these symptoms of dehydration, and the book Water Cures, Drugs Kill 
will do that. People can order through the internet athttp://www.watercure.com 
or Amazon.com or<br>
 Barnesandnoble.com or go to the bookstore and get it.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> You have an upcoming book on obesity, cancer, and 
depression, right?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Yes, I&rsquo;ve got a book called Obesity, Cancer 
and Depression: The Common Cause and Actual Cure. I&rsquo;ve identified why 
these three diseases are actually the branches of the same tree, and each one 
naturally produces a different problem at different age brackets, but they are 
all related conditions that occur as a result of dehydration over time. Time is 
of essence &mdash; when incrementally we become dehydrated, the prune-like 
cells begin to transform. Some of them become cancerous, and I&rsquo;ve 
explained all of this in the book. I explain how dehydration suppresses the 
immune system, directly or indirectly, and that&rsquo;s how most diseases 
occur, including cancer.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> When is this book going to be published?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> It will be available by the end of the year. People 
can keep an eye on the website<br>
http://www.watercure.com, and it will be 
posted there when the book is available.</p> 
<h1>Sodas cause dehydration</h1> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Now here&rsquo;s another interesting question people 
have &mdash; when they go out to eat at a restaurant, there&rsquo;s a 
tremendous amount of economic pressure from the point of view of the restaurant 
chain or restaurant owner to serve them something other than water. I remember 
there was a campaign at one time through Olive Garden restaurants. The campaign 
was called Just Say No to H2O, and they were rewarding waiters for making sure 
people bought some soft drinks rather than drinking water.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> That&rsquo;s because everyone is after a fast buck, 
even at the expense of someone else&rsquo;s health. These restaurants are no 
different from the pharmaceutical industry when they push something that the 
body doesn&rsquo;t need. Of course, they don&rsquo;t know, they don&rsquo;t do 
it knowingly. One can&rsquo;t fault them. It&rsquo;s bad education, and we 
think that these soft drinks are synonymous with water.</p> 
<p>Actually, a lot of children who drink soft drinks actually become 
&ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, but once you take the soft drink away from them, their 
grades improve tremendously &mdash; C&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s become A&rsquo;s 
and B&rsquo;s. So, there is something in caffeine that suppresses the enzymes 
from memory-making. And this is exactly how the plant survives, because 
caffeine is a toxic chemical &ndash; it&rsquo;s a warfare chemical for the 
plant. Anything that would eat it will lose its art of camouflage, its 
alertness, good reaction, good response, and becomes easy prey to its own food 
chain predator.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes, caffeine is technically an insecticide.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Caffeine is technically an insecticide. So is 
morphine and so is cocaine. They are the same family of drugs &mdash; 
neurotoxic substances.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Is there anything else in particular that our 
listeners should be aware of or should do to enhance their health through the 
information that you make available?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Yes, they can keep in touch. They can go to my 
website on a regular basis, and we post information there and letters that we 
exchange and so on. They can become part of the movement to bring honesty back 
into medicine. Because if they&rsquo;re young people, they&rsquo;ve got many 
years to go, and unfortunately in a dishonest form of medical practice, they 
can become vulnerable.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> That website is&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> http://www.watercure.com.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> And the other one is http://www.nafhim.org?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Yes, but they will get the option at 
http://www.watercure.com to go to either site. This information is free, 
it&rsquo;s the latest information in medical science, it&rsquo;s the future 
science of medicine, it&rsquo;s the foundation of the future science of 
medicine, and they have it at their use, free of charge. All they have to do is 
become curious as to learn. And the information is in such simple language that 
anyone can understand it. I don&rsquo;t use jargon. I use very simple English 
to explain complicated problems.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I thank you so much for your generosity, being 
willing to take this time and share your wisdom with the world.</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. B:</strong> Mike, it is my pleasure, and I thank you. I&rsquo;m 
here to be heard and you make it possible for me to be heard, and I&rsquo;m 
grateful to you.</p> 
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Indeed, and likewise from this side. It&rsquo;s 
people like you that will revolutionize medicine, and that&rsquo;s what we need 
today.</p>

<h2>Tasmanian devils listed as endangered in&nbsp;Australia</h2> 
<p>May 23, 2009 in Mr Green Archive | Leave a comment </p>

<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>The Tasmanian devil, a snarling fox-sized marsupial made notorious by its 
Looney Tunes cartoon namesake Taz, was listed inAustralia as an endangered 
species Friday because of a contagious cancer that has wiped out most of the 
wild population.</p> 
<p>The upgrade from &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; under Australian environmental 
law entitles the world&rsquo;s largest marsupial carnivore to greater 
protection in the island state of Tasmania, Environment Minister Peter Garrett 
said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Devils do not exist in the wild outside Tasmania, although mainland zoos 
are breeding captive populations as a strategy against total extinction.</p> 
<p>Their numbers have declined by 70 percent since the facial cancer was first 
reported in 1996. The disease is caused by bites inflicted on each 
other&rsquo;s faces as part of a bizarre mating ritual or while squabbling over 
food. It causes grotesque facial tumors that eventually prevent them from 
feeding, leading to starvation within months.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Strong action is being taken to find out more about this disease and 
to stop its spread,&rdquo; Garrett said.</p> 
<p>The government has already committed 10 million Australian dollars ($7.8 
million) over five years to research the disease and support captive breeding 
programs.</p> 
<p>Scientists have been working since the disease first emerged to save the 
animals, known for their powerful jaws and bloodcurdling growl. Programs to try 
to save them include plans to relocate breeding pairs to island sanctuaries.</p>
<p>University of Sydney researchers seeking to understand how a facial cancer 
could be contagious found that the tumors had originated from a single cell 
line that spreads by biting. Because Tasmanian devils are genetically similar, 
their bodies do not recognize the tumors as foreign cells and do not produce an 
effective immune response.</p> 
<p>Warner Bros., which owns Taz, and CNN founder Ted Turner, who started the 
Cartoon Network, have helped fund the fight against the disease.</p>

<h2>Acupuncture Relieves Lower Back Pain Better Than 
Traditional&nbsp;Treatments</h2> 
<p>May 23, 2009 in Mr Green Archive | 3 comments </p> 
<p>Friday, May 22, 2009 by: Henri Junttila, citizen journalist<br>
 
(NaturalNews) Acupuncture is an old eastern form of medicine. It deals with 
putting needles into specific points in the body to relieve pain or to help 
with other therapeutic purposes. According to Chinese medical theory, 
acupuncture points are located on energy meridians alongside which qi flows. 
This study set out to find out if acupuncture was more effective than 
traditional treatments in treating and relieving chronic low back pain.</p> 
<p>A group of researchers with Group Health conducted the largest study on 
back pain andacupuncture in the United States. The study was called Stimulating 
Points to Investigate Needling Efficacy (SPINE), and it can be found in the May 
11, 2009 issue of the<em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em>. The study was led 
by Dr. Daniel Cherkin, who works with the Group Health Center for Health 
Studies inSeattle. 638 randomly selected adult patients were included at two 
nonprofithealth plans: Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and Northern 
California Kaiser Permanente in Oakland. All of the patients were asked to rate 
their chronic lowback pain on a scale of 0-to-10. They all rated their back 
pain as at least a 3. None of the study participants had tried acupuncture 
before. They were randomly divided into four groups:</p> 
<p>1.Individualized acupuncture with a needle, a diagnostician did a 
customized prescription for acupuncture points.<br>
 2.Standard needle 
acupuncture using a single prescription for acupuncture points on the back and 
the backside of the legs. Experts consider this treatment to be effective in 
relieving chronic low back pain in the majority of cases.<br>
 3.Simulated 
acupuncture using a toothpick in a needle guide tube instead of a needle, 
without penetrating the skin.<br>
 4.Standard medical care which the patients 
would have gotten anyway, and that all patients received.</p> 
<p>All of the patients were treated two times per week for three weeks, and 
then once per week for four weeks. Researchers measured any improvements and 
changes in symptoms after eight weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. After eight 
weeks, all three acupuncture groups were doing substantially better, compared 
to the standard care group, which was functioning only slightly better. The 
benefits of the acupuncture group lasted for a year, but started to wane over 
time.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why people got back pain relief from the 
simulated acupuncture&rdquo; said Karen J. Sherman, Cherkin&rsquo;s co-author. 
&ldquo;Historically, some types of acupuncture have used non-penetrating 
needles. Such treatments may involve physiological effects that make a clinical 
difference.&rdquo; Or it might be all about the mind-body connection, she said. 
&ldquo;Maybe the context in which people get treatment has effects that are 
more important than the mechanically induced effects.&rdquo; Westernmedicine 
does not have highly effective medical treatments for chronic back pain, 
Cherkin said. Back pain is the biggest reason why Americans use alternative 
therapies like acupuncture. &ldquo;The findings of this research show that 
acupuncture-like treatments, including simulated acupuncture, can elicit 
positive responses,&rdquo; said Josephine P. Briggs, M.D., director of National 
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. &ldquo;This adds to the 
growing body of evidence that something meaningful is taking place during 
acupuncture treatments outside of actual needling. Future research is needed to 
delve deeper into what is evoking these responses.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Astaxanthin is Age and Disease Defying Miracle Nutrient 
from&nbsp;Microalgae</h2> 
<p>May 23, 2009 in Mr Green Archive | 1 comment </p> 
<p>Friday, May 22, 2009 by: Barbara Minton, Natural Health Editor<br>
 
(NaturalNews) Summer is the season for astaxanthin, the carotenoid that blocks 
ultra violet damage to the skin. Astaxanthin has been referred to as 
nature&rsquo;s sunscreen, but it does a whole lot more to keep people looking 
good by promoting beauty and radiant health from the inside out. It improves 
fine lines and wrinkles, skin elasticity and moisture content while reducing 
inflammation and cell damage that leads to premature aging. Astaxanthin keeps 
people feeling good too. Recent research has documented its ability to increase
cellular energy, protect against and treat cancer, protect against damage to 
the brain andnervous system, and halt the progression of complications from 
diabetes. In fact,astaxanthin may truly be considered a miracle nutrient.</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin is a wonder compound from microalgae</strong></p> 
<p>People who pay attention to nutrition have long been impressed by the 
properties of the blue green pigment in marine microalgae, and have elevated 
spirulina and chlorella to superfood status. Another microalgae, Haematococcus 
pluvialis, contains primarily dark red pigment. This pigment is the richest 
known source of the carotenoid astaxanthin.</p> 
<p>Only phytoplankton, algae, plants, and certain bacteria and fungi are able 
to synthesizecarotenoids such as astaxanthin. Animals, including humans, must 
consume carotenoids as part of their diet. Astaxanthin is found in many types 
of seafood and is what gives the reddish-orange color to salmon, shrimp, red 
fish, and lobster. It provides the coloration for birds such as flamingoes and 
quail. But don&rsquo;t worry, taking supplemental astaxanthin or eating foods 
that have consumed it will not cause a person to turn orange or red.</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin exhibits a strong photoprotective effect</strong></p> 
<p>Scientists in Rome, Italy compared the abilities of various carotenoids to 
modulate UVA related injury. Fibroblasts from skin were exposed to moderate 
doses of UVA, which stimulated cell death, increased levels offree radicals and 
other reactive substances, decreasedantioxidant enzymes activities, and 
promoted membrane disturbance and enzyme denaturing of hemoglobin. The 
fibroblasts were treated with carotenoids including astaxanthin 24 hours before 
exposure to UVA. Of the carotenoids tested, only astaxanthin exhibited a 
pronounced photoprotective effect and countered all of the UVA induced 
alterations to a significant extent. (<em>Experimental Dermatology</em>, March)
</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin increases cellular energy by protecting mitochondria
</strong></p> 
<p>Mitochondria are the cellular furnaces in which food is turned into energy 
in the form of ATP. During this process,oxygen is released, producing several 
oxygen-derived free radicals that play an important role in various diseases. 
Oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical factor for 
many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative and lifestyle-related 
diseases. Scientists inJapan recently found that astaxanthin decreased induced 
oxidative stress and protected cultured cells from free radicals. Moreover, 
astaxanthin helped maintain a higher mitochondria membrane potential and 
stimulated respiration, allowing for the production of increased levels of 
cellular energy. The researchers then investigated how astaxanthin stimulated 
and interacted with mitochondria when it is stressed. They found that 
astaxanthin improved the ability of the mitochondria to remain in a reduced 
state and maintain its functional integrity under oxidative challenge. (<em>
Journal of Nutrition and Biochemistry</em>, May)</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier to protect 
neurons</strong></p> 
<p>Astaxanthin&rsquo;s powerful antioxidant activity has been demonstrated in 
studies dating back to the mid 1990&prime;s. Many of these studies have shown 
the potential of astaxanthin to target importanthealth conditions and 
acceleratedaging of internal organs and tissues. Other studies have shown 
enhancedimmune response and decreased DNA damage in humans following 
astaxanthin administration. Astaxanthin is capable of crossing the blood-brain 
barrier in mammals, a unique and important property for an antioxidant. This 
characteristic allows astaxanthin to extend its superior antioxidant activity 
to the central nervous system, which is highly susceptible to damage by free 
radicals.</p> 
<p>Based on the data that showed astaxanthin crosses the blood-brain barrier, 
scientists in Japan investigated the neuroprotective effect of astaxanthin by 
using an oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell damage system. Treatment with 
various neurotoxins led to significant decreases in dopamine cells, whereas a 
significant protection was shown when the cells were pretreated with 
astaxanthin. Furthermore, astaxanthin treatment significantly inhibited 
intracellular free radical generation. Based on these results, the scientists 
strongly suggested that treatment with astaxanthin may be effective for 
oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration. They cited it as a potential 
candidate for a natural brain food. (<em>Forum Nutrition</em>, 2009)</p> 
<p>In a recent study researchers decided that carotenoids such as astaxanthin 
should be referred to as &ldquo;antiradicals&rdquo; rather than as free radical 
scavengers because they perform a double action against free radicals, either 
donating or accepting electrons. These researchers determined the antiradical 
capacity of various carotenoids and found thatvitamin E is the most effective 
antiradical in terms of its electron donor capacity, while the most effective 
antiradical in terms of its electron acceptor capacity is astaxanthin. (<em>
Journal of Physical Chemistry</em>, September 25, 2008)</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin keeps cataracts away</strong></p> 
<p>Recent research from Taipei Medical University in Taiwan found that 
astaxanthan protected against induced cataracts in rats treated with selenite, 
a commonly encountered highly toxic form of selenium. The scientists backed up 
their finding by in vitro assay which supported their conclusion that 
astaxanthan was protective against cataracts which are usually caused by 
environmental insult. (<em>Chemical Research in Toxicology</em>, February)</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin protects against and treats ulcers</strong></p> 
<p>Scientists in India sought to investigate astaxanthan&rsquo;s ability to 
prevent ulcers. Astaxanthin fractions were orally administered to rats at 100, 
250 and 500 microg/kg prior to ulcer induction. They found that astaxanthin at 
500 microg/kg could protect gastric mucin at rates up to 67%. Pre-treatment 
with astaxanthin esters resulted in significant increase in the body&rsquo;s 
own antioxidants (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase). 
Histopathological examination substantiated the protective effect of 
astaxanthin in the pre-treated rats. The researchers concluded that astaxanthin 
offers gastro-protective effects by regulating gastric mucosal injury and the 
secretion of acid by gastric cells during ulcerdisease. (<em>European Journal 
of Pharmacology</em>, August, 2008)</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin combined with Flavangenol is powerful against diabetes 
complications</strong></p> 
<p>Flavangenol is an extract from French maritime pine bark that has become 
popular in Japan for its antioxidant potential and its ability to increaseblood 
circulation. Scientists at Japan Women&rsquo;s University studied the effect of 
astaxanthin and Flavangenol, as well as a combination of both, in countering 
oxidative stress in rats with induced diabetes. There were four groups studied: 
control, astaxanthin, Flavangenol, and combined astaxanthin and Flavangenol 
(mix). After 12 weeks of feeding, the results showed that the lipid peroxide 
levels of plasma, lens, and plasma triglyceride levels in the mix group were 
reduced by 44%, 20%, and 20% respectively when compared with the control. In 
the mix group, lipid peroxidation was reduced by 70% in the liver, and 20% in 
the kidney compared with the control. Urinary damage in the mix group was 36% 
lower than in the control. The level of vitamin E concentrations in the plasma, 
liver, and kidney in the astaxanthin and mix groups were higher by 3 to 9 times 
than in the control. The degree of cataract formation was lower than in the 
control group. These findings indicate the astaxanthin/Flavangenol combination 
was highly effective at preventing the progression of diabetic complications. (
<em>International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research</em>, 
July-September, 2008)</p> 
<p><strong>New research highlights astaxanthin&rsquo;s incredible cancer 
fighting properties</strong></p> 
<p>The ability of astaxanthin to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells was 
studied at Catholic University School of Medicine in Rome, Italy. Astaxanthin 
inhibited cell growth in a dose and time dependent manner by arresting cell 
cycle progression and by promoting the death of cancerous cells. Astaxanthin 
resulted in a 220% increase in the expression of the well known anti-cancer 
gene p 53, and a 160% and 250% increase respectively in the anti-cancergenes 
p21 and p27. Astaxanthin strongly upregulated apoptosis through gene 
modification, and increased phosphoylation of the p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 genes by 
160%, 242%, and 280% respectively. Growth inhibitory effects of astaxanthin 
were also observed in HT-29, LS-174, WiDr, and Sw-480 cells. These results 
document axtaxanthin as highly effective against colon cancer. (<em>Cancer 
Letter</em>, May 5)</p> 
<p>Researchers in Japan examined the protective effects of axtaxanthin on 
neuroblastoma cells. Pretreatment of the cells with astaxanthin preserved 
cellular integrity in a dose dependent manner, and inhibited mitochondrial 
dysfunctions, including lowered membrane potential, and gene repair. There was 
a marked abolishment of free radical generation resulting in the blocking of 
activation of pro-cancer gene p38. They concluded that the mechanism through 
which astaxanthan protects neuroblastoma cells is its potent antioxidant 
activity. (<em>Journal of Neurochemistry</em>, December, 2008)</p> 
<p>Several other studies have shown the effectiveness of astaxanthin as a 
preventative and treatment against cancer. In 1994, astaxanthin protected mice 
from urinary bladder cancer. In 1995, the same research group showed that 
astaxanthin prevents oral cancer in rats, and inhibits cancer in a manner more 
pronounced than that of beta carotene. A further study by this group explored 
the effect of astaxanthin on colon cancer in male rats. They found a 
significant decrease in the incidence of colon cancer in the animals that were 
given astaxanthan.</p> 
<p>More research has documented the anti-tumor activity of astaxanthin and its 
mode of action, as well as the contribution of its antioxidant properties to 
protect against cancer metastasis. Astaxanthin was also shown to inhibit 
aflatoxin B1 inducedDNA damage. Aflatoxins are deadly products of mold that can 
cause liver damage and cancer. They are widespread innature and found on 
peanuts, wheat, corn, beans and rice. (<em>Cancer Letter</em>, March, 1997)</p> 
<p>Breast cancer was the subject of researchers in China looking into the 
effects carotenoids have on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and the 
expression of the cancer promoting bcl-2 gene. They found that beta-carotene, 
lycopene, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin all inhibited cell proliferation. The 
carotenoids also down regulated bcl-2 gene expression. (<em>Zhonghua Yu FangYi 
Xue Za Zhi</em>, July, 2002)</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin keeps inflammation away</strong></p> 
<p>Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in several different 
aspects of cardiovascular disease. Free radicals activate transcriptional 
messengers that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, initiation and 
progression of atherosclerosis, irreversible damage following stoke, and heart 
arrhythmia. Because of their ability to extinguish free radicals, researchers 
at the University of Hawaii, characterized the mechanism by which the 
carotenoid group works and reviewed preclinical data. They found that data from 
multiple species support the antioxidant/anti-inflammation properties of 
axtaxanthin, establishing it as an appropriate candidate for development as a 
therapeutic agent for cardiovascular oxidative stress and inflammation. (<em>
American Journal of Cardiology</em>, May 22, 2008)</p> 
<p><strong>Astaxanthin boosts immune function</strong></p> 
<p>Earlier research has documented that astaxanthin significantly influences 
immune function. Several tests carried out at the University of Minnesota found 
it enhances antibody production in mouse spleen cells by exerting actions on 
T-cells, especially T-helper cells. It was able to restore decreased humoral 
immune responses in old mice, through immuno-modulating properties not related 
to provitamin A activity. Studies on human blood cells have demonstrated that 
astaxanthan enhances immunoglobulin production in response to T-cell dependent 
stimuli. The Minnesota group has also conducted studies on the mechanisms by 
which astaxanthan performs its actions. Astaxanthin has also shown in research 
to be effective against chronic viral and autoimmune diseases.</p> 
<p><strong>Patents are pending for the miracles of astaxanthin</strong></p> 
<p>One of the primary producers of astaxanthin from microalgae lists patents 
applied for and pending on its website. Probably the most interest of these at 
the moment is use of astaxanthin for treatment of chronic viral and 
intracellular bacterial infection. Adding astaxanthin to milk, thereby creating 
an immunoglobulin-rich mixture that would rival colostrum, is also a timely 
development. Both these pending patents imply that astaxanthin would make an 
effective supplement to have on hand during the coming fall and winter flu 
season.</p> 
<p>Treatment of the central nervous system, eye damage, poor digestion, and 
circadian rhythm dysfunction are also areas of interest. Astaxanthin is cited 
in patents pending for helicobacter infection, improvement of muscle function 
and disorders, hypertension, stress, and carpal tunnel syndrome.</p> 
<p>Several pending patents involve its use with animals, including treatment 
for mastitis, increased production and breeding of mammals and poultry, and for 
enhancement of growth in farmed fish.</p> 
<p>Patents geared toward the health food industry include 
astaxanthin-containing food or drink, supplements containing chitosan 
oligosaccharide and asthaxanthin, and medicinal preparations for relieving eye 
controlling function error and other eye diseases.</p> 
<p><strong>Beauty products featuring astaxanthin are popping up</strong></p> 
<p>Many topical products featuring astaxanthin are also in the works. The 
driving engine for these is the desire of consumers to slow or stop the aging 
process, and their fondness for natural products and belief that traditional 
lotions and creams provide very limited benefits.</p> 
<p>Products are appearing that feature astaxanthin for its benefits to skin 
through topical application. However, studies have shown that oral 
supplementation works best.</p>

<h2>Allergy Sufferers: Clean Your&nbsp;Nose</h2>

<p>Friday, May 22, 2009 by: Tiffany Boutwell, citizen journalist<br>
 
(NaturalNews) For children suffering from seasonal allergies, summertime can be 
bittersweet. On the one hand, they get to go play outside and burn off all that 
pent-up energy from sitting in a school desk for the last nine months. But on 
the other hand, it can be quite miserable running around with itchy eyes and a 
box of tissues all day. In mild cases of allergies in children, doctors are all 
too quick to prescribe antihistamines, steroids, or other pharmaceuticals to 
treat the symptoms, not the cause. However, there is a safe, all-natural way to 
alleviate the annoyance of seasonalallergies that can be fun at the same time.
</p> 
<p>Nasal irrigation through the use of a neti pot is a practice that 
originated in India and has been used for centuries. It is used to flush the 
nasal cavities of excess mucus and debris and has no side effects. A neti pot 
looks like a miniature tea pot which is filled with warmwater and sea salt. The 
mixture is poured into one nostril with the head tilted, running through both 
nasal cavities and exiting out the opposite nostril. When mixed correctly, 
there is no discomfort in the process and the warm water can actually feel 
quite soothing. For children, it can be fun watching all the snot and gunk come 
out of their noses.</p> 
<p>Neti pots work by thinning mucus which aids in flushing it out easier. This 
allows bacteria and allergens to exit the body instead of spreading and causing 
infections in other areas. The neti pot can also help prevent allergic 
reactions from turning into sinus infections. By eliminating the excess mucus 
from nasal passages, the rinse prevents crusting from mucus that would have 
otherwise stayed in the nose. This allows sinuses to drain properly, thus 
avoiding an infection. They also help reduce swelling in the nasal passages.</p>
<p>Neti pots can be found in most drug stores and are relatively inexpensive. 
They can be stainless steel, plastic, or ceramic, though most in the pharmacies 
are made of plastic. It is really a matter of personal choice as to which one 
is best. For children, they may prefer a decorative ceramic pot best to peak 
their interest.</p> 
<p>The down side to neti pots is that you have to commit to putting in the 
time and effort. It should be done at least once a day but can be done more 
often depending on how severe the allergies are. With the convenience of modern 
medicine, it is much easier to just pop a pill and forget about it. But when 
you factor in the toll that the chemicals take on your system, it`s really a 
lot more convenient to practice prevention.</p> 
<p>Luckily, there are also other natural ways to relieve symptoms if a neti 
pot doesn`t seem right for your children. Eliminating dairy products from your 
child`s diet can be helpful as they are believed to cause excess mucus. Also, 
adding allergy barriers to their sheets and pillows can go a long way in 
preventing symptoms, though they can contain chemicals, so try to find one that 
does not. Mostdoctors, however, will not tell you about the natural and safe 
ways to eliminate or reduce your child`s suffering, but rather yank out their 
prescription pad and send you on your way.</p> 
<p>Your mom always told you to wash behind your ears, but don`t forget to wash 
behind your nose, too!</p>

<h2>Arsenic in Contaminated Water Increases Susceptibility to 
H1N1&nbsp;Influenza</h2> 
<p>May 23, 2009 in Mr Green Archive | Leave a comment </p> 
<p>Thursday, May 21, 2009 by: S. L. Baker, features writer</p> 
<p>(NaturalNews) Not everyone who is exposed to an infectious disease, even 
the widely-feared new &ldquo;swine&rdquo; flu (H1N1), gets sick. And many 
people who do come down with the flu or another illness get over it without 
much trouble. While a lot of factors can be at work, from good nutrition to 
physical fitness, a new study suggests an all-too-common toxin in the water you 
drink could play a role in whether an H1N1 infection makes you seriously ill.
</p> 
<p>According to scientists at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods 
Hole, Massachusetts, and Dartmouth Medical School, the ability to mount an
immune response to H1NI infection, a form of influenza A, <strong>can be 
significantly compromised by even low levels ofarsenic exposure</strong> that 
commonly occur through drinking contaminated wellwater.</p> 
<p>Respiratory infections with influenza A virus are a worldwide health 
problem and kill about 36,000 people each year according to the CDC. The recent 
outbreak of a type of influenza A known asH1N1, or &ldquo;swine flu&rdquo;, has 
killed over 70 Mexicans so far and at least six Americans. The fact that Mexico 
has large areas of very high arsenic in well water &mdash; and these include 
the locations where H1N1 first appeared &mdash; intrigued the MBL and Dartmouth 
research team.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;One thing that did strike us, when we heard about the recent H1N1 
outbreak, is [that] Mexico has large areas of very high arsenic in their well 
water, including the areas wherethe flu first cropped up. We don&rsquo;t know 
that the Mexicans who got the flu were drinking high levels of arsenic, but 
it&rsquo;s an intriguing notion that this may have contributed,&rdquo; Joshua 
Hamilton, the MBL&rsquo;s Chief Academic and Scientific Officer and a senior 
scientist in the MBL&rsquo;s Bay Paul Center, said in a statement to the media.
</p> 
<h1>Immune response seriously hampered by arsenic exposure</h1> 
<p>In a study just published in the journal <em>Environmental Health 
Perspectives</em>, Hamilton and his colleagues reported on their study of mice 
that ingested 100 ppb (parts per billion) of arsenic in theirdrinking water for 
five weeks and then were exposed to H1N1.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When a normal person or mouse is infected with the flu, they 
immediately develop an immune response in which immune cells rush to the lungs 
and produce chemicals that help fight the infection,&rdquo; Hamilton stated in 
a press release. But in the lab animals exposed to arsenic in their water, 
something was clearly amiss. The researchers found that the animals&rsquo; 
immune response to H1N1 infection was initially very weak. But, several days 
later, the rodents&rsquo; immune systems produced a reaction that was too 
strong and too late.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There was a massive infiltration of immune cells to the lungs and a 
massive inflammatory response, which led to bleeding and damage in the 
lung,&rdquo; Hamilton said in the media statement. He also noted that morbidity 
from the influenza infection was found to be significantly higher for the 
arsenic-exposed mice than the control animals who had not consumed 
arsenic-tainted water.</p> 
<p>Hamilton and his research staff have been studying the effects of arsenic 
for years. They&rsquo;ve found that arsenic exposure not only disrupts the 
immune system but also disrupts the endocrine system, causing unusually broad 
hormonal upheavals.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Most chemicals that disrupt hormone pathways target just one, such 
as the estrogen pathway,&rdquo; Hamilton explained in the media statement. 
&ldquo;But arsenic disrupts the pathways of all five steroid hormone receptors 
(estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and 
mineralocorticoids), as well as several other hormone pathways. You can imagine 
that just this one effect could play a role in cancer, diabetes, heartdisease, 
reproductive and developmental disorders &mdash; all the diseases that have a 
strong hormonal component.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t yet know how arsenic disrupts either system at the 
molecular level. But once we know how it affects one system, we will have a 
pretty good idea of how it affects the other systems as well,&rdquo; he added. 
Currently, Hamilton&rsquo;s lab is working on understanding the unusual dual 
effect arsenic has on the endocrine system. Very low amounts of arsenic 
stimulate or enhance hormone responses but at doses just slightly higher, like 
those found in drinking water, it appears to suppress those hormone responses. 
&ldquo;Our principal focus is to figure out this switch. We think that will 
help us understand why arsenic does what it does in the body,&rdquo; Hamilton 
stated.</p> 
<p>He explained that for arsenic to have health consequences, it requires 
exposure day after day, year after year, such as through drinking water &mdash; 
and that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of exposure far too many Americans have to 
the toxin. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims 10 parts per 
billion (ppb) of arsenic in drinking water is &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. However, 
according to Hamilton, concentrations of 100 ppb and higher are commonly found 
in well water in many regions of the country including Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, Maine, Florida, and large parts of the upper Midwest, the Southwest, 
and the Rocky Mountains.</p> 
<p>As reported in <em>Natural News</em> last fall (
http://www.naturalnews.com/024909.html), research suggests the EPA&rsquo;s 
supposedly &ldquo;safe&rdquo; level of arsenic allowed in water supplies for 
public consumption isn&rsquo;t safe at all and could be causing a host of 
health problems, including high blood pressure and artery-clogging 
atherosclerosis. What&rsquo;s more, when the non-profit<em>Natural Resources 
Defense Council</em> (NRDC) analyzed data compiled by the EPA, the 
group&rsquo;s most conservative estimates based on the data indicated that
<strong>more than 34 million Americans were drinking tap water supplied by 
systems containing average levels of arsenic that posed unacceptable cancer 
risks</strong>. Now it appears another serious health problem &mdash; a higher 
susceptibility to a serious case of &ldquo;swine flu&rdquo; &mdash; can be 
added to that list of arsenic-in-drinking-water linked worries.</p>

<h2>Even When Planning for Pregnancy, Women Fail to Follow 
Health&nbsp;Guidelines</h2> 
<p>May 23, 2009 in Mr Green Archive | Leave a comment </p> 
<p>Friday, May 22, 2009 by: David Gutierrez, staff writer</p> 
<p>(NaturalNews) Even women who are planning to become pregnant routinely 
ignore nutritional and other health advice, according to a new study conducted 
by researchers from the University of Southampton, England, and published in the
<em>British Medical Journal</em>.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Having a healthy lifestyle is important for everyone, but is 
particularly so for women who may become pregnant because this can affect the 
health of their baby, not only at birth but throughout life,&rdquo; said 
Bridget Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation. &ldquo;It is worrying that 
so few women in this study appeared to follow nutritional and lifestyle 
recommendations beforepregnancy and it is very important that we communicate 
these messages to women who might become pregnant to improve both theirhealth 
and the health of future generations.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The researchers interviewed 12,500 British women between the ages of 20 and 
34 about their diet, physical activity, alcohol andtobacco consumption and use 
of nutritional supplements. They found that women who became pregnant within 
the next three months were only marginally more likely to follow pre-pregnancy 
health advice than women who did not become pregnant.</p> 
<p>Compliance with recommendations significantly increased after confirmation 
of pregnancy.</p> 
<p>The British government currently recommends that women who are seeking to 
become pregnant take a 400 microgram supplement offolic acid daily, avoid all 
use of tobacco oralcohol, exercise regularly and eat a minimum of five servings 
of fruits and vegetables daily.</p> 
<p>The alcohol requirement has become stricter since the study was conducted; 
at the time, the government recommended a maximum of four drinks per week.</p> 
<p>Among women who eventually became pregnant, only 74 percent were 
non-smokers &mdash; compared with a roughly similar 69 percent of women who did 
not become pregnant. Likewise, only 51 percent of women who became pregnant 
limited their alcohol intake to four drinks per week, compared with 46 percent 
in the other group.</p> 
<p>Perhaps most alarming, according to researchers, was the fact that only 44 
percent of women in the study took any folic acid supplements at all, and only 
5.5 percent took 400 micrograms or more.</p> 
<p>Insufficient folic acid levels can cause neurological defects in an infant 
before most women even know they are pregnant.</p>
