<p>ABOUT THIS ISSUE</p> &nbsp; <br>
Around Earth Day the commercial world, 
including the media, goes crazy with green issues, green products, and green 
reports. Once Earth Day is out of the way for another year the green stuff is 
often put away for another year, providing at least some support for those who 
have been less than enthusiastic about the Earth Day concept, claiming instead 
that &#147;every day should be Earth Day&#148;. <br>
<br>
The 2008 Earth Day 
brought something of an advance with the popular media spending less time and 
space on pop ideas like washing windows with vinegar. In place of the 
simplistic, GL found more in depth reporting of important issues and 
challenging, though necessary, solutions. Maybe the 38th Earth Day will turn 
out to have been the one that changed from simple suggestions to concepts for 
real societal change. In this issue we review some of the 2008 Earth Day 
messages from North American magazines. Our range of topics goes from plastic 
in the kitchen to car insurance as an environmental tool and some sensible 
ideas about spruce budworm from the Canadian Forest Service. <br>
<br>
We merge 
from magazine content to a discussion of the lifecycle of paper books or 
e-books. Guest columnist Prof. Dan Golomb presents his views on Emission Quotas 
or Mandated Control Technologies for greenhouse gas emissions. In the US 
disputes between the federal and state governments over jurisdiction are known 
as preemption. Preemption can be an important issue for environmental 
jurisdiction - an upcoming court case over CAF&Eacute; standards may set new 
rules. There are indications that preemption could become an issue in Canada as 
the federal government attempts to restrict the role of provinces in 
environmental regulation of industry and as provinces such as Ontario attempt 
to restrict the environmental regulatory role of municipalities - see our 
article in this issue on Ontario&#146;s proposed cosmetic pesticide law. While 
the US jurisdictional framework is quite different we know that Canadian 
regulators will be watching the US litigation very closely. <br>
<br>
This 
issue of GL also focusses attention on birds. A new Ontario atlas of breeding 
birds should be in the library of every gardener and landowner. Migratory birds 
are facing increasing threats, not only from Alberta&#146;s tar ponds, but 
federal officials who have responsibility for tracking, monitoring and 
protecting migratory birds are no longer allowed to go to a conference to 
discuss the status of migratory birds. It seems ironic on two fronts: first, 
the birds can travel but the officials cannot, and second, just as we finally 
get around to cleaning up the Sydney Tar Ponds we allow the oil industry to 
start up a new set of tar ponds in Northern Alberta. Ironic, or just plain 
stupid? <br>
<br>
Other articles in this issue include a book review, a review 
of the new Statistics Canada Human Activity and the Environment tome, the 
UNEP/ILO Green Jobs Initiative, a couple of upcoming events, and our Thirty 
Second Summary of lesser noticed but still important environmental news. All in 
all a jam-packed issue. Next issue we will conclude our two part overview on 
asbestos and continue to bring you all the environmental commentary that is fit 
to print! <br>

<br>

HE TAUGHT ME FAR MORE THAN MOST CABINET MEMBERS <br>
<br>
That was one of the 
many compliments extended by the Rt. Hon. Jean Chretien at last week&#146;s 
celebration of the life of Charles Caccia. Mr. Caccia, a forestry economist who 
became MP for the Toronto riding of Davenport, died on May 4th. <br>
<br>

Charles Caccia was one of Canada&#146;s most stalwart proponents of Sustainable 
Development. Though environment minister for only a year and a month at the end 
of the Trudeau government and through the John Turner government in 1983 and 
1984, Charles used his 36 years of service as an MP to hammer away at everyone 
who would listen, and at many of those who wouldn&#146;t, on the need for a 
more environmentally and socially responsible society. He was for more than 10 
years (1994 - 2004) the Chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development and he set up and ran from his office 
the Parliamentary Centre for Environmentally Sustainable Development. <br>
<br>

The celebration of his life attracted the former Prime Minister, the current 
Leader of the Liberal Party, and more past and present Liberal MPs and Senators 
that have gathered together at anything other than a Liberal caucus meeting in 
a long time. Reflecting his outreach and effective consensus building style the 
event was attended by representatives of many of Canada&#146;s environmental 
ngos, as well as by his friends and colleagues from the Institute of the 
Environment at the University of Ottawa which had become his home following his 
somewhat forced retirement, by Prime Minister Paul Martin, from the House of 
Commons in 2004. <br>
<br>
Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party of Canada., 
delivered one of the many tributes to this outstanding man. Among the 
approximately 300 people who crammed into the small chapel of an Ottawa funeral 
home for the entirely secular celebration the only apparent absence was from 
the government side of the House of Commons, but then perhaps Charles, a 
dedicated Liberal, would not have wanted participation from a government for 
which he had little time. <br>

<br>
ELIMINATING 
WASTE AS PART OF A LOW CARBON ECONOMY <br>
<br>
A recent trip to Ottawa served 
as a reminder of the carbon-emitting waste that is inherent in our current 
competitive system. The two airlines that offer scheduled service between 
Toronto and Ottawa each had a flight leaving Toronto at around 8.00 am. The 
flight I was on was substantially less than half full. Observing the arrival of 
the other flight made it obvious that it too was much less than half full. If 
the two flights could have been combined into one, the emissions of one whole 
plane flying this route would have been eliminated. <br>
<br>
Every day courier 
vans from Fedex, Purolator, DHL, UPS and more ply our roads carrying parcels 
and business mail. In GL's part of the world both newspapers and mail are 
delivered with vehicles. If one van delivered the mail, the newspapers, and all 
the courier packages the savings in greenhouse gas emissions would be quite 
significant. <br>
<br>
Our competitive system has no effective mechanisms for 
reduction of waste caused by over-provision of goods and services. When we go 
to the store we expect that store to have the shirt we want in our size. To 
meet that expectation, manufacturers produce far more of most sized goods than 
are actually required and many will go to waste when sale of that particular 
range is discontinued. <br>
<br>
The ideas stimulated by these observations are 
not just the idle musings of a potentially slightly eccentric editor. A recent 
conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics looked at Economic 
De-growth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity. The conference 
received more than 90 abstracts and 140 participants from almost 30 countries 
addressing the questions of: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Is &quot;de-growth&quot; of industrialised countries possible in the 
present context? </li> 
<li>What are the social and institutional conditions required for a fair and 
sustainable economic de-growth process? </li> 
<li>What would be the de-growth scenarios...?</li> </ul> GL will be reporting 
on some of the issues raised and solutions provided in a future issue. <br>
<br>
One of the themes that arises in a discussion of de-growth, and GL would 
caution on use of that term and suggest instead less hard hitting terms such as 
alternative growth (cf. alternative energy) or sustainable growth, is the role 
of government. Many of those considering alternative economic models seem to 
consider that they are going to be brought to us by government. GL would 
suggest that the transitions needed to get us to a low carbon economy are more 
likely to come from the private sector rather than from government. The role of 
government might well be to remove obstacles, such as those in Canada's 
Competition Act that actually prohibit competing companies from discussing 
cooperation to reduce waste, but the actual strategies to reduce unnecessary 
carbon emitting activities are most likely to be designed and implemented by 
the private sector than by government. After all, it is the private sector that 
is causing a large part of our carbon emissions and therefore the private 
sector that is going to have to deal with reducing them. <br>
<br>
Some years 
ago Levi Strauss tried a system of custom manufacturing in which the customer's 
measurements were sent to a North American factory at which the pants were 
assembled by machine to fit the customer. Delivery was promised within three 
weeks. Today at least one movie rental company burns the DVDs as they are 
requested, eliminating the waste of millions of disks that are burned and never 
rented. Book publishers are seriously considering instore on-demand printing of 
books, eliminating the huge numbers of unsold books that end up going to 
landfill or recycling because in a competitive system, it is otherwise 
virtually impossible to properly match supply and demand. <br>
<br>
When flying 
within North America does it really matter to you whether you fly on a WestJet 
plane or an Air Canada plane? Would it really matter if, when you arrived at 
the airport, the agent advised you that there is a less than 50% load on this 
flight today and therefore the WJ and the AC flights are being combined into 
one? The private sector will move to alternative growth, or de-growth, 
strategies, and government will facilitate them, when society demands them. 
Think about de-growth next time you buy something. There's got to be a better 
way and, if we are to stop potentially catastrophic climate change, now is when 
we need to start implementing it. <br>

<br>
THE PHOENIX NEW 
TIMES IS SICK AND TIRED OF ECO-CHIC <br>
<br>
A wonderful Earth Week cover on 
The Phoenix New Times, an alternative conservative leaning news weekly from 
Arizona, featured a green hand giving a green finger. The caption reads Green 
Fatigue: Is anyone else sick and tired of eco-chic? and inside the article 
leads with &quot;Welcome to Phoenix New Times first Green Issue! Not. <br>
<br>

The issue actually includes a number of green articles and a whole list of 
&quot;ecofacts&quot;. Among the observations are: <br>

<ul> 
<li>&quot;Don't drive across town to that eco-fashion show. In fact, don't buy 
those new hemp tennis shoes, or hybrid car. Wear your old clothes, drive your 
old car and save up for solar panels.&quot; Even riding a bike isn't good from 
an environmental point of view because you'll live longer and be a greater 
burden on the planet because of a long life. </li> 
<li>The small stuff doesn't matter; only the coal-fired power plants and 
flying does. </li> 
<li>People are not acting on their expressed concerns about the environment. 
If you watch the lines at Whole Foods, not even one in six people are using 
those nice organic reusable shopping bags. Despite being the sunniest state in 
the Union, only 1,642 people in the state have put up solar panels. </li> 
<li>Polling shows people want companies to do more for the environment than 
they are willing to do as individuals. </li> 
<li>Among the hard choices will be more expensive energy. Arizona is mandating 
15% renewable energy from power utilities by 2025 compared to 1% currently. And 
even having to give up some subscriptions, &quot;I'm thinking Vanity Fair. 
After all, if the name of the game is sacrifice, putting the Material Girl 
(Madonna) on the cover of your green issue is just plain stupid.&quot; </li> 
<li>Unlike Tucson and Denver, which are struggling with declining water 
resources, Phoenix is flush with water due to the historic allocations under 
the Western Water law which assigns water rights and conditions ( use it or 
lose it).</li> </ul> GL doesn&#146;t agree with all the points of view but 
pointing a finger at inconsistencies and hypocrisy can be a very useful even 
though the inconsistencies do not negate the benefits of the overall direction. 
Once GL&#146;s editor asked a professor of philosophy who was very attentive to 
eating vegetarian, even avoiding cheeses made with a small amount of 
animal-based rennet, why he wore leather shoes. He responded that inconsistency 
was part of the human condition. He grinned and refused to say more. <br>

OEKOTEST: GREEN 
JEANS <br>
<br>
The April edition of the German magazine OekoTest featured 
jeans on its cover. The green consumer magazine tests for key environmental 
impacts as well as good looks and performance. The text involved washing 18 
pairs of jeans such as Levi's and Lee, even one which cost 199 Euros. Four of 
the jeans were judged to be very good, eleven good and three satisfactory. Two 
of the just satisfactory were organic cotton jeans downgraded not because of 
the organic cotton but because of the thread and other components. <br>
<br>

The test found that none of the jeans contained detectable heavy metals, three 
contained haloorganics, optical brighteners and so on. Sometimes it was just 
the thread that had the contaminant. Various other features of the jeans such 
as fit, whether the dye bled on washing, shrinkage, style such as low-rise or 
straight leg are discussed. <br>
<br>
Product of Where? <br>
<br>
The article 
illustrates the issue of country of origin, a topic of interest here in Canada 
where the label Product of Canada is seen by some to mislead consumers. It is 
allowed as long as over 50% of the total value of processing and content is 
Canadian, leading to a situation where all of the ingredients or goods could be 
produced elsewhere. There is also the controversy of the clothing for the 
Canadian Olympic team to be produced for the Hudson&#146;s Bay Company, 
clothing designed in Canada but made in China. A consortium of Canadian 
clothing manufacturers say HBC&#146;s claim that Canada hasn&#146;t the 
capacity to make the clothes is full of holes. <br>
<br>
Many of the jeans in 
the ecotest are labelled as &quot;Made in Turkey&quot; while some are said to 
be from Italy and China. OekoTest says that tells the consumer nothing about 
where the jeans are sewn, where the material was woven, where the threads were 
dyed, or where the cotton was grown. For example, the cotton may be grown in 
India and sent to China where the spinning is done with Swiss machines. The 
Philippines may dye the material with chemical indigo from Germany and so on. 
The miles for clothing can be very long indeed with one estimate being 19,000 
km travelled from raw material to finished jeans. And then after its use, the 
old jeans often take another world trip. <br>

CANADIAN 
FACILITY MANAGEMENT: SEEING THE LIGHT <br>
<br>
Canadian Facility Management 
&amp; Design magazine usually contains green topics as green building is among 
the fastest growing of environmental sectors. The April edition has a number 
such articles including the following. <br>
<br>
Fluorescent Light Bulbs 
Recycling <br>
<br>
While self-promotional, the article shows that something 
can be done with fluorescent lightbulbs. The Las Vegas Convention &amp; 
Visitors Authority operates a complex of facilities with an annual budget of 
$284 million. Recycling the thousands of fluorescent light bulbs had serious 
downsides: the cardboard boxes full of them used space for storage and 
occasionally would fall and break bulbs releasing mercury and presenting 
additional hazard with broken glass. The hauler refused to take broken bulbs. 
The trucking service was expensive. LVCVA now uses Air Cycle's Bulb Eater &reg; 
machines which are said to be compliant with the US Environmental Protection 
Agency regulation on disposal of fluorescent light bulbs. The system, fully 
enclosed and filtered so very little vapour is released, crushes the lamps and 
packs them into 55-gallon drums, which are sent by Air Cycle for recycling. The 
cost is about .30 cents per bulb. <br>
<br>
GL spoke to Wally Kiczma of Hotz 
Environmental (Hamilton, Ontario) about CFLs in the fall of 2007. Hotz provides 
industrial and household hazardous waste services in Ontario, transporting to 
their permitted transfer facility. He was optimistic that the province would 
pass HHW regulations which would require hazardous waste handling of compact 
fluorescent bulbs. At the time Hotz was ready to set up a mobile unit to 
collect CFLs, pending permit approval. Ontario&#146;s Environment Minister 
approved the Waste Diversion Ontario plan February 19, 2008 but fluorescent 
light bulbs and tubes are in Phase 2 for which no specific time frame is set. 
<br> <br>
In a FLAP <br>
<br>
Deana Ford has the Last Word in an article about 
a video she made as her major project in the Faculty of Environmental Studies 
at York University in Toronto. Called What's all the &quot;FLAP&quot; about, 
the sale of the video supports Fatal Light Awareness Program FLAP. The video 
explores options for preventing the death of millions of migrating birds which 
often fly into the lighted windows of high rise buildings. As well as turning 
off the lights at night and moving plants away from windows during migrating 
seasons, other options include designing new buildings with less risk to birds.

THE 
ADVOCATE: WHEN GAY MEETS GREEN <br>
<br>
Editor-in-Chief Anne Stockwell of 
US-based The Advocate wrote in the May issue, the first green issue, that 
finding green heros who are also gay wasn't as easy as she expected but those 
she found were finding solutions to the earth's problems in style. <br>
<br>

Musician Rufus Wainwright wants to expand, at least in New York on the June 21st
 summer solstice, the idea of Earth Hour to twelve hours, noon to midnight, 
with the theme of doing nothing for a good cause. Danny Seo started his green 
advocacy group Earth 2000 when he was 12. Now he gives eco-advice to Hollywood 
celebrities, has written several guides, one on green parties, one on green 
giving, and is currently taping a new version of Red, Hot and Green, an 
environmental design show for HGTV. Like Martha Stewart, he is branding himself 
but as an eco-version household guru. Simmons mattresses are branded as Natural 
Care by Danny Seo and J C Penney which sells his Simply Green brand of organic 
cotton and bamboo blankets. He says he hasn't sold out, &quot;I've always felt 
strongly about sustainability but, unlike a lot of activists, I also want to 
eat great food, wear cool clothes and be surrounded by beautiful things.&quot; 
When asked if green is the new pink, Seo replied, &quot;I honestly don't think 
it is a gay-straight thing. What we're seeing is a total cultural shift. If you 
don't like it, you're still going to have to adapt to it. Eventually it becomes 
second nature to everybody.&#148; <br>

U.S. NEWS: WASTE 
LESS ENERGY <br>
<br>
The cover story of U.S. News April 25 edition suggested 
ways to cut power bills. A chart shows that in the US each person uses 340.5 
million BTUs a year (Canadians use 436.2 and people in China use 51.4). 
Although any one electronic gadget may not use much energy, when multiplied by 
the number in each household, the energy use adds up. For example, the digital 
photo frame costs only $9 per year but according to the Electric Power Research 
Institute, if every household in the US had just one, it would require five 
medium-sized power plants to run them. The always-on converter for receiving 
satellite or cable uses about half the electricity of a new Energy Star 
refrigerator. <br>
<br>
For business, the first goal should be to stop energy 
wastage. In the US, about 400 coal plants or 20% of the US electricity capacity 
could be supplied by electricity from the heat currently wasted in industrial 
and other processes. Recycled Energy Development (Westmont, Illinois) is 
working with West Virginia Alloys which produces silicon for solar photovoltaic 
systems to convert heat from the furnaces. Motors consume 65% of energy used by 
companies but are often inefficient running at top speed even when the job 
doesn't require it. ABB is manufacturing variable drive motors. <br>
<br>

Although commercial buildings used one third of the US electricity, landlords 
often focus on front-view design such as aesthetics and lobbies rather than the 
energy efficiencies of the heating and air conditioning and ventilation systems 
which they charge back to the tenants who have no control over the 
infrastructure of the building. Some companies are entering into agreements 
with landlords to improve energy efficiency of buildings getting paid from the 
savings. <br>

<br> CORPORATE KNIGHTS: CO2 POLLUTERS <br>
<br>
In its 2008 Investment Issue, 
Corporate Knights, the well-known Canadian magazine featuring corporate social 
responsibility and sustainability, includes a list of the Carbon 50, the top 50 
of the 315 large industrial facilities reporting greenhouse gas emissions. The 
top five 2006 GHG emitters by company (with number of facilities and totals 
rounded to nearest million tonnes ) is reported as: <br>
1. Transalta 
Corporation (10) 27 million tonnes <br>
2. Ontario Power Generation Inc. (6) 25 
<br> 3. Imperial Oil Limited (11) 14 <br>
4. Saskatchewan Power Corporation (4) 
13 <br>
5. CU Inc (4) 12 <br>
<br>
In previous issues, CK has also ranked on 
more positive features such as annual The best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada. 
<br> <br>
Under the intriguing title of How to replace coal, CK surveyed the 
leaders of eight large energy companies with three questions, including What 
green energy has the best prospect to displace dirty coal by supplying a 
significant portion of baseload power? The answers are fascinating, with one 
saying gasification of coal, two saying wind, three saying nuclear, three 
saying hydro, one saying deep geothermal, and one saying &#147;we don&#146;t 
know&#148;. (Multiple answers were allowed.) CK does not draw any conclusions 
from this but GL wonders whether this very wide competition of ideas is a good 
thing or a bad thing for the Canadian economy and environment (see our 
Eliminating Waste in a Low Carbon Economy editorial in this issue!). <br>

NATIONAL 
GEOGRAPHIC GREEN GUIDE: PLASTICS <br>
<br>
National Geographic launched a new 
quarterly called the Green Guide in March 2008. The magazine reaches well 
beyond NG&#146;s normal nature and travel world and seems to be headed towards 
the genre of green consumer magazines, a genre that has been relatively poorly 
represented on North American store shelves since GREEN magazine died in the 
early 1990's. (GREEN magazine is not to be confused with The Green Magazine, 
which is a golfing magazine, or Green Magazine, which is for John Deere tractor 
enthusiasts, so named because John Deere tractors come in any colour the farmer 
might want as long as it is green.) <br>
<br>
One of the articles in the NG 
Green Guide is about picking the best plastic for storing your food and drink. 
The Guide suggests two plastics to avoid, PVC and polystyrene, and lists 
polycarbonate as questionable due to potentially hormone-disrupting bisphenol A.
<br> <br>
NG Green Guide urges consumers to avoid PVC, sometimes known as 
vinyl, SPI code 3, because some products leach hormone-disrupting chemicals 
into food and because it is not generally recyclable in post-consumer programs. 
Polystyrene, SPI code 6, is said to possibly leach styrene. PET, SPI code 1, is 
listed as safe but single use bottles should not be reused. Brand name items 
considered safe including baby bottles are listed but the buying guide warns, 
&quot;Watch out for micro-safe containers: this only means that the plastic 
shouldn't melt in the microwave. They may emit contaminants while cooking.&quot;
<br> <br>
While some other advisors have told consumers to avoid SPI Code 7, 
the Green Guide correctly reports that SPI code 7 is for &#147;other and 
miscellaneous resins&#148; and in addition to polycarbonate and other resins it 
is also used to identify PLA, a bioplastic generally considered safe but not 
recyclable as it must be composted. <br>

COTTAGE 
MAGAZINE: OH, BUOY!SPEAK UP FOR THE ENVIRONMENT <br>
<br>
In an article titled 
&quot;Oh, Buoy! Speak up for the Environment, Cottage Magazine invites the tens 
of thousands of recreational boaters who access British Columbia's 27,000 
kilometre coastline to collect data on their observations of changes and 
condition of the marine ecosystem. Report forms have been posted for the 
Recreational Boater's Environmental Report Card. <br>
<br>
To a certain extent, 
the project is a reaction against environmental complaints about coastal 
development and recreational boating. As the editors say, &quot; Although 
numerous organizations already exist and are doing excellent work to help 
protect the environment, many are agenda-driven and, as such, are mandated to 
focus their efforts on specific areas of interest. With our efforts, on the 
other hand, the only goal is to provide real, verifiable and unbiased data from 
boaters who have a genuine interest in ensuring our relatively pristine marine 
waters remains that way for ourselves, our children and for future 
generations.&quot; <br>
<br>
There are two forms. One is the general Comment 
which asks questions such as: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Have there been areas of waters which you can no longer use due to 
industry, industrial debris, human settlement or foreshore construction? Where? 
</li> 
<li>Changes about the state of the coast over time. </li> 
<li>Which areas do you consider pristine. </li> 
<li>Overall condition of coastal waters on a scale of 1 to 10.</li> </ul> The 
Boater's report card includes questions on <br>

<ul> 
<li>whether the anchorage is pristine </li> 
<li>water quality </li> 
<li>reason for pollution e.g. floating debris, sewage </li> 
<li>whether boaters eat shellfish, and comments on the abundance of shellfish 
</li> 
<li>above tide e.g. clean, minimal human debris </li> 
<li>noise </li> 
<li>whether boater has any photos of the pollution or source </li> 
<li>changes since the last visit.</li> </ul> Paid subscribers see links to

NEW YORK TIMES 
MAGAZINE: PAY AS YOU DRIVE INSURANCE <br>
<br>
New York Times magazine produced 
a green issue for the first time this year. One of the articles highlighted how 
car insurance can be a mechanism to provide incentives for car owners to drive 
less. Under Pay As You Drive insurance, drivers would pay for insurance based 
on every mile driven. Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt are authors of 
Freakonomics and provide more detail in their online blog. One insurance 
company Progressive is experimenting with MyRate which includes a device 
installed in the car which measures not only how many miles driven but braking 
and acceleration to assess risk. It could mean low mileage drivers could 
receive lower cost insurance (although some in the insurance industry say that 
risks aren't directly related to higher number of miles driven). The risks for 
the insurance company are that the high mileage drivers will switch insurance 
companies. From an environmental point of view the idea is that if drivers 
understand that extra miles cost money, they will drive less reducing the 
environmental impact. <br>
<br>
Whether or not that particular concept would 
succeed or have the desired effect is an interesting discussion but the idea 
links to how often seemingly non-environmental policy can affect the 
environment in either a positive or a negative way. <br>

MACLEAN'S: IDEAS

Maclean's April 28 issue includes an article on ten ideas

RENEW CANADA: FOR WHOM THE ROAD TOLLS <br>
<br>
Publisher of ReNew Canada, Todd 
Latham writes in the Closing Shot of the March-April issue, &quot;Toll and 
concession roads are the future.&quot; He predicts that municipalities face 
many pressures to move to private-public partnerships, both fiscal and 
environmental. &quot;Sooner or later, something will have to be done to pay for 
new roads, alleviate congestion and incentivize people to move in less 
carbon-intensive ways. Building more and better transit systems is the way to 
start, but charging drivers for the use of roads (or at least major highways) 
should be part of the plan.&quot; He mentions a poll of the Canadian Automobile 
Association in which 2/3 of people oppose toll roads so politicians are 
reluctant but Latham says bring on true cost accounting and fee for service. He 
also thinks gas should be $2.00 a litre, a wish that may be filled sooner than 
expected. <br>
<br>
Todd Latham has a more in-depth view of environment and 
sustainability than a regular journalist. Prior to founding ReNew Canada 
&quot;The Infrastructure Renewal Magazine&quot; in 2005 he was co-founder and 
editor of HazMat Management magazine and co-founder of Solid Waste &amp; 
Recycling magazine. He is very active in the environment industry having, for 
example, served for many years on the Board of the Ontario Environment Industry 
Association and the Canadian Environmental Auditing Association. <br>

always finds it somewhat amusing whenever this magazine arrives because its 
large format (9 &frac12;&quot; x13&quot;) doesn&#146;t fit our

sequence to store flat on top after the box is filled but it&#146;s well worth 
storing. The March-April issue had the theme Sustainability and the

<br> FOREST HEALTH: MORE INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM APPROACH <br>
<br>
The Spring 
2008 issue of Forest Health &amp; Diversity from the Canadian Forest Service 
discusses various studies on biodiversity of forests. When insect outbreaks 
such as spruce budworm (SBW) occur, researchers have tended to study the insect 
in isolation from its community, the ecosystem. SBW is indigenous to North 
America so adaptation has taken place. There is a whole living dynamic system 
that changes over time and geography in response to many factors including high 
and low abundance of SBW. Much as stocking a bird feeder attracts more birds, 
natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and flies, and predators as well as 
other plant-eating insects respond to the contribution that SBW makes to the 
food web. Some won't be present at all if it isn't worth their while, ie there 
aren't enough SBW while other species with more omnivorous tastes will stick 
around to feed lower down on the food chain until the number of SBW increases 
again. <br>
<br>
Researchers at the Atlantic Forestry Centre have concluded 
that: <br>

<ul> 
<li>More diversity of plants in the forest plots researched increases the 
number of generalists parasitoids. The plant diversity also provides additional 
host species for the parasitoids to attack in addition to the SBW. Providing 
more food opportunities for the enemies of SBW led to lower peak SBW density 
(and less leaf loss). The greater the biodiversity of the forest the lower the 
level of damage by the SBW. </li> 
<li>SBW may have a negative economic impact on the forest but is integral and 
vital to the forest ecosystem. </li> 
<li>It is important to understand not just the diversity of the species but 
their interactions, or biostructure of the ecosystem, as insect outbreaks are a 
natural part of the cycles within the forest ecosystem. To predict the impact 
of SBW requires not only population information about them but other members of 
the food-web and the dynamics between them. </li> 
<li>Forest plantations and other homogenization of plants reduce the ability 
of general parasitoids to buffer insect outbreaks leading to more severe and 
more costly outbreaks of insect pests such as SBW.</li> </ul> Paid subscribers

GREEN READING: 
WILL THAT BE PLASTIC OR PAPER? <br>
<br>
Environmental Science and Technology 
writer Erika Engelhaupt bought an electronic book (e-book) reader for reading 
books, magazines and newspapers, said she felt &quot;very eco-hip&quot; but 
then was told that her reader would end up as a piece of toxic plastic junk in 
a developing country someday soon. Her article considers the different impact 
of choices of paper or e-book including landfill space, tree saving, and 
pollution from manufacturing/transport. She referenced a number of studies 
including a life cycle assessment done by Greg Kozak, now based in Chicago, 
four years ago for his master's thesis. Kozak concluded e-books won for 
environmentally friendliness despite their electricity use. A paper textbook 
created 4 times the greenhouse gas emissions, more ozone-depleting substances 
and chemicals causing acid rain, 3 times more raw materials and 78 times more 
water. The Amazon Kindler uses electronic ink display rather than LCD and is 
even lower in electricity use. <br>
<br>
A Swedish study concluded that for 
toxicity, a web-based newspaper read for 30 minutes or more had the highest 
toxicity for humans and marine life, followed by a print newspaper and the 
least toxic was an e-book. For freshwater and land-based ecosystems, print 
newspapers were the most toxic. <br>
<br>
In the end, Engelhaupt mused that she 
found it difficult to make a decision which trades off toxics vs trees; one 
needs a Ph.D to deal with complications and in the end, it may be a matter of 
ethics, &quot;We decide whether inhaling the smell of a book is worth losing a 
tree and whether having a smaller carbon footprint is worth the risk of adding 
toxic waste to a far-flung land. No purchase is without consequence, although 
I'm feeling pretty good about having done my homework on this purchase, even if 
it was after the fact.&quot; <br>

DAN GOLOMB <br>

<br> Our guest columnist is Dan Golomb, Professor at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology Laboratory for Energy and the Environment. For a number 
of years now, he and fellow researchers have proposed a method for mixing 
liquefied CO2 with pulverized limestone in water creating an emulsion which 
would be released into the ocean in order to sequester carbon. Environment 
groups such as Greenpeace oppose the idea because they feel that the only way 
to tackle climate change is to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions at 
source. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change referenced Golomb's 
research in its IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. 
Golomb&#146;s method is one of a number of alternate methods of sequestering in 
the marine environment, some of which are even more controversial (see GL V12 
N9, September 17, 2007 Effectiveness and Environmental Side Effects of Offsets: 
Iron Dump). <br>
<br>
Golomb&#146;s suggestion to apply performance standards 
for technology is not entirely new in the area of international agreements, 
e.g. specifications for double-hulled ships in maritime agreements or phase-out 
of CFCs in refrigerators once alternatives become available. <br>
<br>
However, 
some in the developing world see proposals to apply industry standards as a way 
to get around the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change commitment to have 
&#147;the polluter pay&#148; as the excess greenhouse gases were emitted 
primarily by the industrial world from 1850-2000. When Shri Shyam Saran, 
Special Envoy of the Indian Prime Minister addressed the Confederation of India 
Industry CII on climate in April, he spoke of the proposals for a sectoral 
approach suggested by Japan, which along with the US and Australia is a member 
of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This 
&#147;Partnership&#148; is commonly seen by Kyoto supporter as a cover for US 
President Bush to claim he is supportive of action on climate change despite 
his climate scepticism and withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. The sectoral 
approach identifies high energy industrial sectors such as cement, construction 
and transport. Worldwide standards would be set to achieve lower carbon 
emissions for each sector. Saran said he didn't have any problems with the 
industrial countries setting such standards nor with these countries helping 
India with improving efficiency standards and exchanging best practices for 
technological upgrades to India's industries. <br>
<br>
Saran dismisses the 
argument that companies will just move to India from the industrial world as 
irrelevant to the international agreement because he said the UN climate 
convention sets no such extraneous competitiveness conditions, &quot;The UNFCCC 
was itself designed to address a grossly unlevel playing field, already stacked 
heavily against the developing countries. Now there is a barely disguised 
attempt to overturn this very basic equity principle through so-called sectoral 
approaches. ... There is a very real danger that in adopting sectoral standards 
among themselves, the developed countries would use the competitiveness 
argument to put up protectionist tariffs against products from developing 
countries. This must be resisted at all costs.&quot; <br>

GUEST COLUMN: 
EMISSION REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES: EMISSION QUOTAS OR MANDATED CONTROL 
TECHNOLOGIES <br>
by Dan Golomb <br>
<br>
This essay is an expansion of a 
letter that was published in Environmental Science and Technology (Golomb, 
2007). In the ES&amp;T letter I proposed that instead of meeting some 
internationally agreed quotas on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions, 
al&aacute; Kyoto, there should be an international agreement stipulating that 
each country's government impose performance standards on GHG emitting source 
categories. In other words, major emitting source categories must implement 
internationally prescribed control technologies that each source category has 
to employ in order to minimize GHG emissions. By implementing these performance 
standards, each country will achieve GHG emission reductions to the maximum 
achievable level by the currently best available control technology, called 
BACT. There is a precedent in the USA for implementing BACT. New coal fired 
power plants were mandated in 1977 to implement BACT in order to prevent 
significant air quality deterioration in Federal national parks (USA Clean Air 
Act and its Amendments, Section 111). In practice, what this meant is that new 
power plants that are likely to impact the air quality in national parks had to 
install the best available control technology for reducing emissions of sulfur 
oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The selection of a particular 
BACT had to consider emission reduction efficacy as well as the cost of the 
technology. BACT can change from time to time as new technologies become 
available that are superior to the prevailing BACT. When enacted, BACT for SOx 
emission reduction was flue gas desulfurization (the &quot;scrubber&quot;); for 
NOx, the low-NOx-burner; for particulate matter, the electrostatic precipitator.
<br> <br>
Unfortunately, for emission reduction of CO2, the principal 
anthropogenic GHG that causes global warming, there is no relatively simple 
add-on technology to new sources, let alone retrofit technology for existing 
sources, which can reduce the emissions of CO2. Take the example of coal fired 
power plants. At present, there are only three technologies that are thought to 
reduce CO2 emissions efficiently, but at a significant cost and energy penalty. 
They are as follows: (a) Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle cum Carbon 
Capture and Sequestration, called IGCC-CCS. In such a power plant coal is 
gasified into CO and H2; the CO is further processed in a water gas shift 
reaction to yield CO2 and H2. The CO2 is separated, usually by physical 
absorption, and the H2 is used for power generation either in a gas turbine or 
in a fuel cell. The separated CO2 is liquefied under high pressure, and piped 
to a sequestration site such as a semi-depleted oil or gas reservoir, or a deep 
underground sedimentary saline formation. (b) Oxyfuel combustion. Here coal is 
combusted in almost pure oxygen (95+%) in a boiler. The flue gas consists 
almost entirely of CO2 and H2O; the water vapor is condensed, and the CO2 is 
liquefied and disposed as in (a). This method requires an air separation unit 
that separates oxygen from nitrogen. Because of the enormous quantities of 
oxygen required (a 1000 MW power plant would need approximately 20 000 tons per 
day of oxygen), this method is deemed to be even more expensive and energy 
intensive than IGCC-CCS. c) Chemical absorption. The flue gas of a conventional 
boiler passes through an absorption tower where a chemical absorbent, usually 
monoethanolamine (MEA) absorbs CO2 but not the rest of the flue gas. The 
absorbed CO2 is boiled off in a separate tower, liquefied and disposed as in 
(a). <br>
<br>
The second largest source category for CO2 emissions is 
transportation: automobiles, trucks, locomotives, ships and airplanes. For 
transportation vehicles, no technology exists that can capture CO2 from the 
exhaust gases in any efficient and economic way. The only solution is to 
increase the fuel economy, that is, liters of fuel consumed per kilometer 
travel. There are several ways to achieve increased fuel mileage. For example, 
the internal combustion engine/electric motor hybrid, plug-in electric car, and 
foremostly, reduction in vehicle mass. Fuel consumption is directly 
proportional to vehicle mass. Propelling a vehicle from rest to cruising speed, 
and maintaining cruising speed is, primarily, dependent on the weight of the 
vehicle (Fay and Golomb, 2002). There are perfectly acceptable passenger 
vehicles that do not exceed 1000 kg in weight. They can achieve a fuel economy 
of 10-12 km/litre (62-74 mi/ga) with conventional engines, and even better with 
hybrid propulsion. Governments must simply mandate that no passenger vehicle be 
produced that weighs more than 1000 kg. Period. No fleet averaged gas mileage, 
so that some people can buy gas guzzlers, as long as there are others who buy 
gas sippers. No large SUVs, vans, pickup trucks, unless certified that they are 
for commercial use, not personal transportation. <br>
<br>
The disadvantage of 
BACT is that it pertains only to new sources. Grandfathering of existing 
emitting sources must be strictly limited. Again, a government diktat is 
necessary. Existing sources must be phased out on an internationally agreed 
time scale. For example, if it is agreed that a reasonable life time of an 
existing coal fired power plant is 35 years, it must be scrapped on its 35th 
birthday, and a new power plant built with carbon capture and sequestration. 
Or, a utility can decide it is cheaper to replace the retired coal-fired plant 
with a nuclear-fueled power plant, wind farm, solar thermal, solar 
photoelectric, tidal, geothermal, wave, or any other plant that does not emit 
CO2. Old gas guzzling vehicles must be phased out over an agreed period (10 
years?). Also, here a government intervention is necessary. Owners of the old 
vehicles receive a government financed voucher toward the purchase of a new gas 
saving vehicle. <br>
Massive emission reduction of CO2 (and other GHGs) 
presents a paradigm shift in our urban-industrial civilization. It will require 
enormous expenses, technology development, economic and social dislocations, 
lifestyle and habit changes. Some economists believe that economic incentives, 
such as cap-and-trade, fee-to-pollute, carbon tax, gasoline tax, etc, will 
minimize the monetary and social costs of GHG emission reduction. Since we are 
paying for emission reduction anyway as tax payers, rate payers, or commodity 
buyers, I doubt that as individuals we shall save if emission reduction is 
accomplished through government fiat or through economic incentives. However, 
it appears to me that internationally agreed upon technology standards 
promulgated by each country's government are easier to implement, and are more 
efficient and equitable than, for example, putting an arbitrary tax on a ton of 
carbon emitted. With implementation of technology standards, including 
automobile fuel standards, it is easier to achieve a certain leveling-off of 
GHG concentrations in the atmosphere than by imposing arbitrary emission 
reduction quotas on individual countries that evidently not every country wants 
to accept. Uniform, world-wide technology standards are less likely to pit one 
country against the other, e.g. developed vs. under-developed. A new coal-fired 
power plant has to have carbon capture cum sequestration, no matter in what 
country it is built. A new personal automobile can weigh no more than 1000 kg, 
no matter where it is manufactured. <br>

ENVIRONMENTAL 
PREEMPTION ON TRIAL <br>
<br>
On April 24, California Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger along with 11 other governors sent a letter to President Bush 
expressing disappointment that the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration was proposing rules on Corporate Average Fuel Economy that would 
preempt states that are working on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. <br>

<br> Among other definitions, preemption is the authority of a higher level of 
government to enact (or to refuse to enact) legislation thereby restricting the 
ability of lower governments to legislate. Under the US Constitution, Congress 
has the power to enact statutes which replace those of local or state 
governments or prohibit those governments from making different statutes on the 
same issue. The power of Congress to preempt is limited and is sometimes but 
not always expressed directly in a federal statute. Some state authorities such 
as interstate agreements and taxes are not usually subject to preemption. The 
federal law may be a partial preemption in that the state law may be valid if 
it does not conflict with the federal one or if the state law applies to 
special conditions or need. The federal law may set a minimum standard only and 
the state may be free to set higher standards or the federal level may transfer 
responsibility to the state to enforce a law consistent with the federal one. 
Preemption has been in the US Courts a lot as states try to keep their power in 
areas traditionally regulated at the state level. It is a toss-up from 
corporate point of view whether federal preemption is good or bad but often it 
is seen to be weaker than some states such as California would enact and has 
the advantage that the same law applies across the country. It is also a 
toss-up whether preemption is good for the environment as sometimes the higher 
government sets a higher standard, sometimes a lower. <br>
<br>
A US Senate 
Committee on the Judiciary heard testimony last fall on the preemption issue. 
Donna Stone, state representative from the state of Delaware and current 
President of the National Conference of State Legislatures spoke on what she 
called, &quot;preemption crisis facing states.&quot; NCSL maintains a 
Preemption Monitor which concludes that &quot;a large part of the policy 
jurisdiction of state legislatures and of city and county officials has been 
lost. States and localities cannot legislate in response to their citizens' 
needs when the federal government has preempted the policy field.&quot; Stone 
suggested that states can &quot;try novel social and economic experiments 
without risk to the rest of the country.&quot; States are seen to be more 
sensitive to the needs of their citizens and more able to address problems 
identified by constituents. The chief objection to federal preemption is that 
often the rules are formulated by bureaucrats. <br>
<br>
US Chamber of Commerce 
Favours Preemption <br>
<br>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce identified the 
benefits of federal preemption for the business community at the US Senate 
Committee. For example, recent preemptions have invalided laws which have 
previously allowed consumers to sue under state tort and product liability 
laws. Fewer lawsuits are good for business. <br>
<br>
For business, the 
proliferation of jurisdictions (50 state governments, 87,500 local government 
units including 3,000 counties, 19,000 municipalities and 16,000 towns and 
townships means &quot;complicated, overlapping and sometimes even conflicting 
legal regimes...with the potential to impose undue burdens on interstate 
commerce&quot;. A single set of uniform rules streamlines legal issues, reduces 
regulatory burden and creates a national marketplace with the potential to 
reduce costs for consumers. Federal level laws are made with better access to 
experts including scientific and technical advisors. Between 1789 and 1992, 
Congress enacted 439 significant preemption statutes with 53% of theses between 
1969 and 1992. Preemption is especially important for products crossing 
jurisdictional boundaries where additional product labelling and design at the 
state level adds burdens. Examples of federal preemption statutes are on 
&quot;recreational boats, automobiles, pesticides, cigarettes, medical devices, 
flammable fabrics, hazardous substances, and many other consumer 
products.&quot; GL notes that the presentation didn't say that the current US 
Administration tends to favour business at the expense of the environment so 
preemption trends that way too. <br>
<br>
California Greenhouse-Gas Waiver 
Request <br>
<br>
In 2005, the California Air Resources Board requested a 
waiver of federal preemption under the Clean Air Act&nbsp;for enforcement of 
motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards in the state. Eleven other 
states have adopted the same rules. <br>
<br>
The US EPA gave notice that it 
would deny the waiver in December 2007. California had been granted previous 
waivers but the EPA commented that these were for air pollutants affecting 
local and regional air quality. Greenhouse gases are a national and global 
issue. The President signed into law a standard of 35 miles per gallon for all 
50 states rather than the 33.8 miles per gallon set as a standard in California 
and &quot;a patchwork of other states.&quot; This federal law is seen as 
delivering energy security benefits and a national approach to global climate 
change. A waiver would require California to &quot;have a need to meet 
compelling and extraordinary conditions.&quot; While denying the waiver, EPA 
chief Stephen L. Johnson concludes by giving California credit, &quot;I agree 
that increased vehicle standards can be a win-win for the environment and the 
economy. I have no doubt that the national standards Congress adopted and the 
President signed into law this week were enacted, in part, because of your 
efforts.&quot; The official notice of the denial of the waiver was published in 
the Federal Register March 6 with petitions for review filing deadline of May 5.

PROVINCE 
PREEMPTS MUNICIPALITY PESTICIDE BY-LAWS <br>
<br>
On Earth Day, April 22, the 
Ontario Minister of Environment John Gerretsen proposed legislation that would 
, &quot;if passed, ban the sale and use of pesticides for cosmetic purposes 
across Ontario. This is the first step in Ontario's new toxics reduction 
strategy which we announced last November.&quot; The draft act which is only 
three pages long exempts agriculture and forests. Golf courses are exempted 
provided they apply integrated pest management programs. Pesticides used for 
health protection purposes such as to reduce the risk of West Nile are 
exempted. In addition, the Minister may add other exemptions. The bill contains 
very little detail but while some people think pesticides apply to bugs not 
weeds, this proposed amendment to the Pesticide Act aims to control active 
ingredients which act as herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, 
miticides,&nbsp;snail and slug bait and others. Products covered will also 
include fertilizer-pesticide combos. The Environmental Bill of Rights posting 
includes two lists: one of potential active ingredients which MAY be 
prohibited, including 2,4-D, captan, copper, rotenone, pyrethrins and diazonon. 
The potential list of brand products now sold for cosmetic uses also includes 
products not only for lawns but also for roses, fruit trees, potatoes, and 
other vegetables and such products as bug foggers. Some contain ingredients 
which are sometimes used as alternatives to more toxic ingredients. These lists 
are very useful but may confuse as they are not the lists that will be banned 
but rather serve as a basis of discussion. <br>
<br>
In Ontario, all federally 
registered pesticides must be reclassified before they are legal for sale and 
use. The power to ban the sale rather than just the use of these pesticides 
makes the proposed legislation different from the bylaws of municipalities in 
Ontario which deal only with the use. <br>
<br>
The government is obviously 
anxious to demonstrate that it is keeping a promise made during the fall 
election, leading to release of some contradictory information. For example, 
announcements indicate that the regulations which flesh out the legislation 
should be ready &quot;by next spring&quot; but the Ministry of Environment E.R. 
posting is more cautious saying the timing is unknown and depends when the act 
is passed in the Legislature. <br>
<br>
To Preempt or Not to Preempt <br>
<br>

According to a Toronto Star article, Premier Dalton McGinty said that 
municipalities could go further than the provincial standard, &quot;If you're 
asking if municipalities can exceed the provincial standard we put in place, 
yes they can when it comes to use.&quot; However, Bill 64 removes the right of 
municipalities to enact their own bylaws: <br>
&quot;By-laws inoperative <br>

(5) A municipal by-law is inoperative if it addresses the use, sale, offer for 
sale or transfer of a pesticide that may be used for a cosmetic purpose.&quot; 
<br> <br>
Environmental activists such as the Canadian Environmental Law 
Association have lauded the legislation partially because of the announcement 
that municipalities could continue to pass bylaws with stricter provisions but 
when eventually the legislation is passed, the support may change. It will also 
depend on the enforcement as Ontario already has environmental laws on the 
books which have no positive benefit because they are never or seldom enforced.

UNEP/ILO/ITUC 
GREEN JOBS INITIATIVE <br>
<br>
The Green Jobs Initiative is a program of the 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) which 
seeks &quot;to assess, analyze and promote the creation of decent jobs as a 
consequence of the needed environmental policies. It supports a concerted 
effort by governments, employers and trade unions to promote environmentally 
sustainable jobs and development in a climate-challenged world.&quot; Among the 
goals are to provide both employment and poverty reduction under climate 
adaptation and mitigation programs. <br>
<br>
UNEP commissioned a report from 
Worldwatch Institute with assistance from the Cornell University Global Labour 
Institute. The Green Jobs Report is being presented at events and conferences 
to promote ideas which address fairness for workers and communities affected 
negatively by changing climate, production/consumption patterns, and trade 
policies. One of these events was a UNEP/ILO research conference held in 
Niigata, Japan in April. <br>
<br>
One of the speakers was one of the lead 
authors of the Green Jobs report, Michael Renner, Worldwatch Institute There 
are various ways of enhancing green jobs including: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Green job creation in renewable energy, energy performance services, 
mobility services. On average, renewable energy produces 2 jobs to every 1 job 
in the fossil fuel industry. </li> 
<li>Eliminating traditional polluting jobs: mining, packaging. This will 
decrease jobs in some sectors but the net employment effects are unknown. </li> 
<li>Substitution: shift from fossil fuels to renewables, waste disposal to 
recycling, primary metals production to secondary production. </li> 
<li>Transformation: Green existing jobs through greener workplace practices. 
</li> 
<li>Radiating out: once core areas such as energy and transport are greener, 
the effect may expand into other areas.</li> </ul> Renner presented a matrix 
which has Environment (green) on one axis and Decent Work (decent) on the 
other. Examples of jobs which are neither green nor decent include coal mining 
with inadequate safety. Decent but not green include airline pilots. Green but 
not decent are low-wage installers of solar panels and green and decent are 
well-paid public transit workers. He also discusses some of the drivers and 
obstacles to creating decent green jobs such as rising oil prices as a driver 
and insufficient green investment as an obstacle. <br>

BISPHENOL A: TO 
BE DECLARED CEPA TOXIC <br>
<br>
The Ministers of Environment and of Health 
gave notice in the Canada Gazette April 19 of intent to put bisphenol A on 
Schedule 1 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. There is a 60 day 
public comment period ending June 18. All comments must cite the Canada 
Gazette, Part I, and the date of publication of the notice and be sent to the 
Executive Director, Existing Substances Division, Environment Canada, Gatineau, 
Quebec K1A 0H3, 1-800-410-4314 or 819-953-4936 (fax), 
Existing.Substances.Existantes@ec.gc.ca (email). <br>
<br>
The risk management 
recommends the government make stringent targets for migration of bisphenol A 
in both new and existing food packaging for infants and children such as in 
infant formula and canned foods as well as polycarbonate plastic baby bottles. 
The children most vulnerable are defined as those 18 months and under. 
Regulations should address industrial processes which release bisphenol A into 
wastewater and sludge&nbsp;as well as management of products and materials 
containing bisphenol A headed for disposal or recycling. <br>
<br>
The 
government intends only to prohibit the import, sale and advertising of 
polycarbonate baby bottles but proposes no other regulations. Government 
agencies such as Health Canada are going to be working with industry to reduce 
bisphenol A in canned food. <br>
<br>
GL thinks that if these are the only 
actions the government is going to take when they are designating Bisphenol A 
as a dangerous chemical, Canadian ought to be very worried about the chemical 
regulatory agenda, not only the other uses of BPA but also all the other 
potentially endocrine disrupting substances. <br>

BIRD ATLAS: BEST 
BET FOR GARDEN DESIGN <br>
<br>
The second Atlas of the Breeding Birds of 
Ontario (2001-2005) assesses how bird distribution in Ontario has changed since 
the first atlas (1981-1985). Detailed maps document the distribution of 
breeding species based on 1.2 million individual breeding bird records. Each 
species is introduced with a photo and sometimes with a photo of its habitat, 
eggs, or young. Detailed maps show the confirmed, possible or probable breeding 
evidence and differences between the first and second atlas. Participants from 
all over the province are listed including those from the three banding 
stations in Haldimand where GL is located. <br>
<br>
The map for the red-winged 
blackbird covers a large part of the province in maroon for 
&quot;confirmed.&quot; The species account shows how human influences affect 
birds. Use of avicides in the US to control &quot;pest&quot; birds have led to 
a decline from a population peak in 1976. On the positive side, some of the 
densities of this species are found around sewage lagoons which supply the 
man-made equivalent of wetlands with high insect availability. Some data may 
underestimate the density of birds such as the white-crowned sparrow which 
nests in remote inaccessible northern areas. <br>
<br>
Kathy Renwald, Master 
gardener, author, and head of creative development for the Royal Botanical 
Gardens in Burlington, Ontario, recommends the bird atlas for gardeners. 
Besides the ornamental value of trees in hiding a view or creating privacy, 
providing flower, fruit, colour and so on, trees and shrubs also attract birds. 
Manitoba maple is less than appreciated by gardeners but provides habitat for 
black-crowned night herons. While the larger birds such as geese, eagles and 
wild turkeys are increasing, some of the smaller birds are struggling. She 
suggests that the Atlas, &quot;joins the best garden design books in providing 
solid information on plants we can use for beauty and for the benefit of 
birds.&quot; <br>
<br>
GL thinks that this is one of those books that could not 
be produced for less than $100 without thousands of hours of volunteer time, a 
community-based science research project resulting in a book&nbsp;which should 
be owned and consulted by every business in Ontario to help&nbsp;protect our 
wildlife by knowing where birds are located, how threatened they are and what 
the threats are. <br>

MIGRATING BIRDS: 
NO TRAVEL BUDGET FOR CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERVICE <br>
<br>
The Haldimand Bird 
Observatory Board of Directors approved $400 for a director to attend the 
Canadian Migration Monitoring Conference, an event of the Canadian Migration 
Monitoring Network which meets every two years, the latest meeting held October 
2007 in Alberta. Director Jim Smith who oversees banding at Rock Point wrote in 
The Harrier, the local charitable group's newsletter, &quot;I had mixed 
feeling, thinking that Haldimand should have a presence at this conference but 
not wanting to close down my station in order to go.&quot; The Conference was 
held at the Boreal Centre, a modern and eco-friendly building in Slave Lake 
Provincial Park, Alberta. There were 20 people from 13 of the 25 stations in 
the network. Also attending were three representatives from Bird Studies Canada 
including Audrey Heagy, who is BSC's Bird Conservation Planning Biologist and 
wearing a new hat as CMMN Development Coordinator. She moderated most of the 
four day conference. BSC is a non-government organization dedicated to wild 
bird conservation and research There were no representatives from Canadian 
Wildlife Service because of an imposed travel freeze on their employees. Smith 
notes that &quot;Outside of the information I learned that it was evident we 
were more than just a few stations located in Haldimand County. We are an 
integral part of something which encompasses all of Canada. A network where the 
work we are doing contributes to a total whole.&quot; <br>
<br>
GL can only 
wonder at the difficulties of a travel freeze on a department with 
responsibility for species on the move. <br>

STATS CAN: 
HUMAN ACTIVITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT <br>
<br>
The Statistics Canada report Human 
Activity and the Environment 2007 2008 was released on Earth Day April 22. A 
number of media outlets wrote about the greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 as if 
this were new information. The emissions were 747 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent 
25.3% above 1990 and 32.7 above the target agreed to by Canada for meeting its 
commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and were reported almost a year ago. 
Environment Canada's press release was on May 25, 2007. GL notes that as of May 
11 this year Canada had not filed its annual report to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change of which the Kyoto Protocol is one part. 
Parties in Annex I (or the industrial countries) are required by April 15 of 
each year to provide annual national GHG inventories covering emissions and 
removals of direct greenhouse gases from six sectors (Energy, industrial 
processes, solvents, agriculture, lulucf (land use, land use change and 
forestry), waste) and from all years from the base year and period to the most 
recent year.&nbsp;Judging from the other reports such as the US, the most 
recent data seems to be 2006. <br>
<br>
The annual report is in two parts: 1. 
Common reporting format CRF or standardized data tables and 2. National 
Inventory Report, a comprehensive description of the methodology for the data 
sources, control and quality assurance. The US and the European Union as well 
as many of the European countries have submitted their reports by the deadline. 
Australia, Canada, Japan and Russia as well as some former Eastern European 
countries such as Croatia and smaller European countries such as Luxembourg 
have not had their reports posted yet. Canada's 2006 inventory is particularly 
significant because the Minister of the Environment John Baird readjusted 
greenhouse gas emission targets based on 2006 with different timelines rather 
than the 1990 baseline and the timelines Canada agreed to internationally under 
the Kyoto Protocol. <br>
<br>
Imports and Exports: Allocating Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions <br>
<br>
The issue of how to allocate greenhouse gas emissions due 
to exports may raised as an issue post-Kyoto. Statistics Canada provides data 
on energy exports. In 2005, 7,764 petajoules of energy in the form of oil, gas 
and electricity were exported by Canada. Production of this energy resulted in 
72.8 Mt of GHGs, almost 10% of all GHG emissions. <br>
<br>
The Statistics 
Canada report states if looked at from the demand side that 76% of the increase 
in domestic industrial emissions from 1990 to 2003 was due to production of 
goods and services for export mostly fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil and 
natural gas for export. If we are going to allocate greenhouse gas emissions to 
the end-user, than Canada will have to add to its inventory all the CO2 
generated to produce the goods and services we import. <br>
<br>
It becomes 
difficult, however, to make policy decisions today when statistics are based on 
5 year old data. Various statistics are provided to 2007 including gross 
domestic product and employment by industry and exports or fuel-efficient cars 
produced by the automotive sector, etc. Water and truck transport is to 2004, 
rail and air to 2006, motor vehicle registration to 2007, usual mode of 
transportation to work 2001 and so on. Research investment and some 2004 data 
on the environmental industry such as expenditures is provided although 2004 
data was previously published by Statistics Canada for this sector. As always, 
GL observes that since Canada gave up State of the Environment reporting, the 
data collected is not specific enough nor consistently up-to-date enough to 
serve to support good environmental policy decision-making. <br>

GREEN LIVING FOR 
DUMMIES <br>
<br>
Now that the global phenomenon that is the Dummies series of 
books has included in its list of titles one on green living, one has got to 
think that the concept of green living has reached the mainstream. The even 
better news is that this is one of the better books in a genre of what you can 
do to help the environment books that GL usually finds to be less than 
environmentally effective or scientifically accurate. Perhaps that is because 
the three authors have experience in a number of developed countries and at 
least one of them focusses his professional career on sustainable lifestyles. 
<br> <br>
This book is good value for money and potential readers who already 
know something about green living should not be put off by the title which to 
make matters worse, includes the subtitle &#147;The fun and easy way to go 
green&#148;. In more than 350 pages of fairly small but well laid out print the 
Dummies guide covers most of the key elements of greener living: understanding 
the impact of greener choices, renewable energy, greener building and 
remodelling, making your home healthy and efficient, minimizing trash and 
decluttering your life, a greener yard, growing your own food and greening your 
diet, raising green kids, dressing green, travelling green, greening your 
community, and doing more. <br>
<br>
Unlike many green living books, this one 
is realistic and thought-provoking. For example, in the chapter on greening 
your diet it does not say that to be green you must be a vegetarian. Instead it 
explains the issues, quotes sources, and concludes that it is helpful to a 
green lifestyle to reduce the amount of meat you eat and choosing green meat 
(local and organic or sustainably produced) whenever possible. <br>
<br>
The 
section on green cleaners does not condemn all commercial cleaning products, as 
many green guides do, but instead gives tips on how to reduce the environmental 
impact of keeping a clean home. Unlike books from more environmentally zealous 
authors, this one explains that there is a lack of scientific evidence about 
the linkages between some ingredients of household cleaning products and human 
health problems, that governments are unlikely to act until there is such 
evidence, but that people who wish to play it safe, and green, can get 
information from various sources, including governments, to help them make 
their own decisions. The book suggests greener approaches to cleaning and other 
household activities while appropriately, in GL&#146;s view, staying away from 
recommending the home chemistry and household mixing of vinegars, baking 
powder, bleaches and soaps that sometimes could get a person into making their 
own toxic concoctions. <br>
<br>
Although we recommend this book as one of the 
best in its category, we still recommend that readers approach some of the 
suggestions with a sense of scepticism. For example, Green Living for Dummies 
presents conversion of your diesel car to used cooking oil in an uncritical 
way, despite some evidence that use of used cooking oil in a converted diesel 
engine may increase emissions and may not be great for engine systems. Clay or 
terra cotta pots are recommended as being greener for container gardening than 
other types of pots, presumably plastic, even though it is likely that more 
energy is used to make the terra cotta pot than the plastic pot, especially if 
the plastic pot is made of recycled material. Readers who apply the recommended 
approach to thinking about the environment will most likely spot these 
inconsistencies themselves. <br>

GET YOUR BPA FIX 
FROM WORLD WILDLIFE FUND USA <br>
<br>
On the day that Canada&#146;s Health 
Minister Tony Clement made his announcement that he would be putting bisphenol 
A on the CEPA toxics list, Gallon Letter was relieved to find that our friends 
at World Wildlife Fund Canada had indeed ceased their marketing of WWF 
logo-encrusted polycarbonate water bottles. But not so their friends to the 
south. The panda people in the US are still flogging polycarbonate water 
bottles at the bargoon price of $11.25 with 80% of proceeds going to bisphenol 
A and 20% to the panda people. <br>
<br>
GL finds it very strange that WWF in 
Europe has been campaigning against endocrine disruptors since the beginning of 
the century, that WWF Canada withdrew its BPA bottles after we drew the irony 
of selling something that you are campaigning against to their attention, but 
WWF USA still thinks the stuff is perfectly safe to use. Whatever can it mean?
