<h1>Me and my spoon</h1> 
<p>If you thought spoons were only vehicles for food and parody, think again. 
What should cutlery be made of?</p>

<p>Has anything amusing ever happened to you in connection with a spoon? When 
Private Eye asks the question, the answer is usually no: the Me and My Spoon 
column features spoons because spoons aren't especially interesting. Or weren't 
until now. The other day I went to a dinner about spoons. Or, more 
specifically, on what spoons are made of, which would be a good name for an 
inspirational movie about spoons. It was at the Indian restaurantQuilon, and 
the idea was to see whether using different metals in cutlery affected the 
taste of food.<br>
<br>
They sat us down in front of seven shiny spoons: 
copper, gold, silver, tin, zinc, chrome and stainless steel. We were about 12:
Harold McGee looking owlish, Heston Blumenthal with his arm in a sling, some 
academics, journalists and PRs. The dinner was organised by something calledThe 
Institute of Making, which sounds like a university for toddlers but is in fact 
&quot;a multidisciplinary research club for those interested in the made 
world&quot;. &quot;Artist and maker&quot; Zoe Laughlin, one of its founders, 
was there. Her website,asifitwerereal.org, includes &quot;a selection of 
biographies&quot; variously written by &quot;a friend&quot;, &quot;a 
parent&quot;, &quot;a sibling&quot;, &quot;a stranger&quot; (someone she met on 
the Tube) and &quot;a pet&quot; (&quot;Zoe has no pets,&quot; we're told).</p> 
<p>In front of me was a booklet with background research. &quot;In this 
project,&quot; it informed, &quot;we asked ourselves how do these materials 
taste, do they affect the taste of food, and is it possible to understand, and 
thus design, the affect (sic) they have?&quot; Overleaf was a series of tasting 
notes on spoons. Copper, I read with a creeping sense of terror, is &quot;found 
to slightly inhibit saltiness&quot;, silver has &quot;a slight 
bitterness&quot;, zinc carries an &quot;earthly, dry, rasping tendency&quot; 
while poor old stainless steel was prosaically glossed as &quot;familiar&quot;.
</p> 
<p>The food at Quilon is deliciously spiced and complex: it was impossible to 
focus on the spoons. To me, these varied only in their metal-ness &ndash; 
copper tasted more metallic than stainless steel, which tasted more metallic 
than gold. As far as I could tell, this was more or less it. But around me 
cooed a table in raptures at different &quot;flavours&quot; in the metals. 
&quot;I dare you to try the copper spoon with the grapefruit!&quot; challenged 
a dauntless soul. &quot;Check out the taste profile of silver with beer 
foam!&quot; raved another. Even Blumenthal, who looked thoroughly baffled by 
proceedings, gamely chipped in by observing &quot;there's a bitterness to the 
zinc&quot;.</p> 
<p>To me this dinner, with its tasting notes and the rest, seemed like the 
dernier cri in shark-jumping foodie bullshit. Yet there could be the germ of a 
good idea here. The gold spoon<em>was</em> nicer than most of the others: it 
was neutral and clean and barely tasted metallic. And the taste of an eating 
implement does affect the taste of the food. A friend of mine loves the wooden 
stick at the end of a lolly, while I hate its splinters and the way it dries 
your tongue. Plastic spoons always taste greasy, and are only good for babies. 
They say caviar should be eaten from bone. Perhaps stainless steel isn't the 
best metal for cutlery, perhaps metal isn't the best material for cutlery at 
all &ndash; though on current evidence I reckon it is. What do you think?</p>

<p>School dinners when I was unfortunate enough to have to eat them were 
served on these awful tin (? some kind of cheap metal, anyway) plates. Although 
I can't entirely blame the plates for the dreadful food, the water, served in 
cups made of the same metal, was truly disgusting.</p> 
<p>So yeah, the metal affects taste. How could it not?</p> </li>

<p>We had those metal beakers at my primary school too. I'm pretty sure that 
when the new fangled palstic ones were introduced, we'd all go for them first, 
presumably because they didn't affect the taste of the cheap orange squash we 
were drinking.</p> 
<p>Bit dissapointed to not have a column about actual food today, Oliver. 
Consider yourself reprimanded. There's an idea! What about a series of columns 
entitled &quot;Consider........&quot; That might be really interesting on a 
Friday afternoon!</p> </li>

<p>I remember the awful plates, cups and the cutlery . . . it used to make 
your mouth tingle and not in a good way!</p> 
<p>As for me, plebian that I am, I am quite happy with stainless steel. </p> 
<p>Having said that, I am a little confused. As a child, I was taught that 
chowing down on your cutlery was rather rude and that in polite company you 
weren't supposed to chew on your spoons . . . so in theory it shouldn't really 
matter . . .</p> </li>

<p>I too remember the awful institutional crockery, cups and cutlery at school 
- they used to make your mouth and teeth tingle and not in a good way! Now I 
have a complete aversion to anything that looks remotely like those old plates 
and forks. Beling somewhat plebian, I am happy to use stainless steel.</p> 
<p>Having said all that. When I was a kid, we were taught that it is the 
height of bad manners to chow down on your cutlery. That you should try to eat 
delicately, rather than shovelling the food in and that you shouldn't be 
tasting your spoon. So if it is polite not to slurp on your spoon, just how 
much can you taste of the metal? Just a thought!</p> </li>

<p>Isn't it just the fine layer of rust/oxidisation you are tasting?</p>

<p>I have to admit that I often use my titanium 'camping' spoon (due to being 
lightweight and attachable to things because it has a hole in the handle) when 
tasting stuff during cooking. It's not so much that I think it tastes different 
to a stainless steel spoon or a wooden one, more that the low density/heat 
capacity means that you don't burn your lips/tongue so often</p> </li>

<p>I do hope they did a few blind tests - having people try the foods without 
knowing what the spoons they were using were made of - otherwise it would just 
have been a load of people eating some free food and restaurant scoring a bit 
of free publicity, and we can't have that, can we?</p> </li>

<p>The article was perhaps a touch pseud but the issue is a real one.</p> 
<p>I can feel my teeth going on edge remembering the weird plastic taste of a 
Kia Ora orange in the cinema circa 1969 - the square clear plastic carton and 
the strangely hard straw. Euuughghgh.</p> 
<p> My parents have nasty nickel plated cutlery which tastes horrid and 
finally you can't eat a boiled egg with a metal spoon - must be horn or bone.

<p>What I don&rsquo;t quite understand is why the fascination with the 
material used in the spoon effecting flavour when the material used in the 
cooking pot is going to have a much larger effect since it is in contact with 
the food for much longer. For example most kitchens will be using black steel 
pans (they aren&rsquo;t black when new but become black with use). Also if you 
cook with cast iron (not enamelled) pans like a Dutch Oven then the food will, 
variables aside, supply enough trace iron to supply your daily requirements.</p>
<p>Other restaurants will use untreated aluminium, it has superior heat 
qualities (although cast iron has better heat retention properties), but 
isn&rsquo;t advised by the FSA as it can react with foods and cause a build-up 
of aluminium in the body (a bad thing). Copper, when used in cooking pots is 
invariably tinned for the same reasons- copper pots are rare these days as 
there are better alternatives.</p> 
<p>Almost all food preparation will involve a knife, there are two main 
materials, carbon steel and stainless steel. Stainless steel is non-reactive 
(but harder to sharpen) while carbon steel is reactive, even slicing a tomato 
can cause a reaction (it&rsquo;s easier to keep sharp but holds a blade for a 
shorter time, hence a straightening steel).</p> 
<p>Finally there are your fillings, if you have the traditional Amalgam 
fillings in your mouth then they contain 50% Mercury and descending amounts of 
silver, tin and copper, plus other trace metals.</p> 
<p>Given all this I fail to see how the spoon can compete.</p> </li>

<p>the entire premise was a complete joke. It would have to be organized as a 
blind taste test to determine if the material the cutlery is made of has 
anything effect on taste.<br>
&quot;To me this dinner, with its tasting notes 
and the rest, seemed like the dernier cri in shark-jumping foodie bullshit.

<p>Totally agree, I probably didn&rsquo;t forcibly state that I favour 
Stainless Steel, especially when it has a copper &lsquo;sandwich&rsquo; base- 
Stainless is what the Environmental Health will recommend and is what I use in 
the main, I also use anodised aluminium.</p> 
<p>The problem with all the other alternatives (and anodised to an extent) is 
they can&rsquo;t be given a good scrubbing, with stainless you can take a metal 
scourer (SP?) to it with impunity.</p> 
<p>But you have to accept black steel is cheaper and you can season that (as 
you can cast iron but it is heavy and can break if dropped). But I agree with 
you, they are good pans, I have 2.</p> </li>

<p>It competes - theoretically at least - in the way that adding salt just 
before serving has a different effect to adding it at the beginning of cooking. 
It's the raw immediacy of the metal, the touch of it on your palate, its cold 
bite on your teeth. Theoretically.</p> </li>

<p>The most important thing about spoons is the depth. A shallow bowl should 
render the food easier to slide off with the lips. An overly concave spoon 
seems to leave a residue in the bottom so requiring the eater to turn the spoon 
over in the mouth. I've noticed my elderly mother find deep dessert spoons to 
much for her now.<br>
Plastic medicine spoons also are guilty of being too 
curvaceous. Stamp it out of them , I say.</p> </li>

<p>If your teeth are in reasonable condition (and not magic) then they 
don&rsquo;t feel anything, except pain. Your tongue and nose do the tasting, if 
I smell a silver (plated) spoon I am highly unlikely to notice a difference 
between that and a stainless steel spoon and as I have explained, eating curry 
isn&rsquo;t going to have any effect regardless of what metal you use, 
somebody&rsquo;s aftershave would have more effect.</p> </li>

<p><i>stainless steel isn't the best metal for cutlery, perhaps metal isn't 
the best material for cutlery at all &ndash; though on current evidence I 
reckon it is. What do you think?</i></p> 
<p>In Thailand you can get beautiful teaspoons carved from mango wood. They 
are so tactile and a gorgeous colour. I love them. No discernable taste 
profiles I have to add.</p> 
<p>Once in our local cafe we came across a table of four South Africans (not 
that nationality has anything to do with it) with teaspoons hanging off the 
ends of their noses -- if you lick a teaspoon of the right bowl dimension it 
will stick to your nose -- it was hilarious. Admittedly they'd had the best 
part of a litre of Sangria but it was all great fun and they had everyone 
trying to do it. Much more fun than trying to analyse the taste profile of 
silver with beer foam.</p>

<p>interesting article oliver. looking back, in my grandfather's house in 
south india, water was ALWAYS served in little copper pots, we ate and drank 
from pure, solid silver plates and glasses and a very strange thing my 
grandfather did at every mealtime....he would transfer his big gold wedding 
ring from his left hand to his right hand while eating. then he would wash his 
hands and transfer his ring back. i asked him why and he said this was so that 
tiny particles of gold would mix into the food over time and enter his system. 
infact, some ayurvedic medicines are made with fine gold dust and herbs....as 
for the taste of food....my grandmom was such a fantastic cook, i never noticed 
anything else!!!!</p> </li>

<p>Copper, in small amounts, has an anti-bacterial action, it also has 
excellent heat transfer qualities, so it would be great for holding water (as 
we know, as we use copper water pipes). Silver also has similar properties, I 
have a pair of hiking socks (well I have two pairs) and they are woven with 
small amounts of silver. Apart from being the best made, most expensive socks I 
own, they also do work- in that they stop foot rot and stinky feet, you can 
wear them for days, which is important if you are going on a hike for a few 
days or more.</p>
