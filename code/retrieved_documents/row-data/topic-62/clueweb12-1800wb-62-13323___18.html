<h3> So I Killed My Veggies </h3> 
<p>Two Thursdays ago I posted on how well me veggie seedlings were doing. The 
cucumber and zucchini plants were thriving and taking over my table. That same 
day, I brought the seedlings out onto the deck for some fresh air and sunlight. 
It was a beautiful day. Fast forward to Friday morning. I come downstairs in 
the morning and realize my kitchen table is missing something. My veggie 
plants!!! Sure enough, I look out onto the deck and there they are. I forgot to 
bring them in. They initially didn't look too good, but I kept watering them 
and caring for them in hopes that by some miracle I could revive them. But now 
I think it is safe to say that they are pretty much all dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
The 
only seedlings that survived are the peppers (the right 4 columns). Hopefully I 
can keep those going and plant them outside soon. I'm so bummed. My first 
attempt at a veggie garden has already gone down in flames. I think I am going 
to pick up some more cucumber and zucchini seeds and just plant them directly 
outside once there is no more overnight frost. Maybe that will go better.<br>

<h3> Grab My Button! - Fixed Again! </h3> 
<p>So I have a huge favor to ask of everyone! The server where my button was 
previously located had issues so now the location of it has changed. If you 
have grabbed my button in the past, it is probably no longer displaying on your 
site. So I would be so grateful if you could update it with the new HTML that 
is posted over in the sidebar. And if you don't already have my button...well, 
why not??? Seriously, get it! :)<br>
<br>
Thank you all in advance, I 
appreciate it!<br>
<br>
UPDATE: OK, I fixed it yet again. We should be good to 
go now. So please copy the code one last time.<br>
So sorry for the mix up and 
thanks!!<br>

<h3> EarthLust Review and Giveaway </h3> 
<p>Since we are talking about waste-free lunches this week, I thought it would 
also be a good time to take a look at reusable water bottles. We all spend way 
too much money for bottled water when we can get water at home for free and 
with no waste!EarthLust recently sent me one of their 20 oz stainless steel 
bottles to test. What you will first notice about their bottles is that they 
come in so many cool designs. You don't have to settle for just a plain 
stainless finish anymore, unless you want to of course. I picked the Poppy 
design (pictured far left) because I liked the blues and greens. But there are 
lots of other great ones. I also like the Butterfly design.<br>
<br>
The 
EarthLust bottles also come in 3 sizes: 13 oz, 20 oz and 1 Liter. Theyare made 
from high quality #304 food grade stainless steel, which is naturally safe 
unlinedand all paints used are non-toxic. I love that these bottles come with a 
carabineer clip which is really handy, especially when pushing a packed 
stroller. Two weekends ago we took the boys to the zoo (what a rough day). The 
twins are in a side by side double stroller which I love, but it is short on 
cup holders. There are only 2, which I was using for their cups, so I used the 
clip to hang myEarthLust bottle from the back of the stroller.<br>
<br>
<br>

There it is hanging out and looking cute! That was a long and hot day and I was 
so glad I had that water with me. One last thing i want to mention is the 
bottle opening. I have other bottles with extra wide openings that make it 
easier to get ice in. The problem I have with those is that the opening is 
wider than my mouth and I often spill some water. (Or maybe I'm just clumsy?) 
The opening on theEarthLust was better fit for my mouth and so I didn't have 
any spillage issues.<br>
<br>
Remember that when we talk about waste-free 
lunches, we are not just talking about our kids. Many of us also pack our own 
lunches for work or outings. Skip the bottled water and get yourself a nice 
stainless steel bottle like EarthLust. It will more than pay for itself as far 
as saving you money since you wont have to buy water and by helping save the 
planet from plastic waste.<br>

<h3> Going Green: Waste-Free Lunches </h3> 
<p>One of my Green Goals for 2009 was to pack waste free lunches for my son. I 
actually had not realized what a lousy job I was doing of this until I took 
this photo of his lunchbox for myFabkins review a few months back. Here I 
thought I was doing great with the napkin, spoon and reusable sandwich 
container. But as you can see I also have single-serve yogurt, apple sauce, 
cheese and juice in there. That's a whole lot of waste going on, especially 
since our preschool does not recycle (don't get me going...).<br>
<br>
It is so 
easy to get into the habit of using single-serve foods. They are so darn 
convenient - just toss them in and go. We need to take a step back for a moment 
and think about what happens to these containers when we're done. If the school 
or place they are being used has recycling, well then it isn't quite as bad. 
But it is stillunnecessary waste. The key is to reduce our waste, even 
recycling waste.<br>
<br>
So how do we get away from the single-serve addiction
? I started with the applesauce.I finished up the few I had left and then when 
the grocery store was having a sale on organic applesauce in big jars, I 
stocked up. Buying a large jar is cheaper then buying single-serve normally, so 
on sale its even better. I fill aTake &amp; Toss snack cup with applesauce, 
snap the lid on and voila! No ideally it would be better to get away from 
plastic and use stainless steel storage, but baby steps. Over time I would 
definitely like to do that, I'm just not there yet.<br>
<br>
Now I just have to 
work on the cheese sticks, yogurt and juice. We still have some juice boxes we 
are working on, but when those are gone I should start sending in a strawsippy 
cup with water/juice in it. I actually used to this in the beginning of the 
school year, not sure why I stopped. I'm not really sure what to do for the 
yogurt and cheese sticks. I've read some suggestions on buying the bigger 
blocks of mozzarella cheese and then slicing them into sticks yourself. I have 
to research that and see how it works out economically and give it a try. As 
for the yogurt, I might be stuck with it for a while. I would love it if
Stonyfield made a large container of YoBaby and YoKids yogurt. That would save 
a ton of plastic and a ton of money. Maybe I'll write to them! :)<br>
<br>
Do 
you have any tips for packing a waste-free lunch? Please share them!<br>

<h3> Surf Sweets Review and Giveaway </h3> 
<p>I may have mentioned in the past that I have quite a sweet tooth. I love 
candy! However it is very difficult to find candies that are not made with high 
fructose corn syrup and lots of artificial ingredients. While our grocery store 
has a decent natural/organic foods section, there really isn't any candy in it. 
So I was very excited whenSurf Sweets sent me their candy to try out!<br>
<br>

Surf Sweets makesorganic and natural gummy candies and jelly beans. I love 
their line:If it doesn&rsquo;t exist in nature, you won&rsquo;t find it in Surf 
Sweets.What makes Surfs Sweets so great?<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Made with organic fruit juice and sweeteners.</li> 
<li>Natural colors and flavors.</li> 
<li>100% of your daily Vitamin C.</li> 
<li>Free of corn syrup and GMOs.</li> 
<li>Made in a nut free facility.</li> 
<li>Gluten free.</li> </ul>When I received my package of goodies, the first 
thing I tore open, literally, was the bag ofSuper Sour Worms. Oh my god they 
were so good. Unfortunately, they only lasted a few minutes, I devoured them! I 
love sour gummy candies and I can honestly say these may be the best I have 
ever had. When I was pregnant with my twins, I kept a huge bagof Sour Patch 
Kids at my desk at work and would munch on them throughout the day. For 
whatever reason, they helped with my nausea. So now I really wish I hadn't 
eaten all of my sour worms so quickly because maybe they would help with the 
morning sickness I am currently suffering from.<br>
<br>
I also really enjoyed 
theFruity Bears. They were very tasty. The rest of the candies I let my kids 
try. (That's right, the first two bags were for ME!) Of course they enjoyed 
them all very much and left nothing behind. Josh loves his gummy bear vitamins 
so I knew he would like theGummy Bears by Surf Sweets. Those didn't last very 
long either. I should have snapped a picture of him inhaling them. What is 
wonderful about Surf Sweets candy is I didn't feel guilty about giving my kids 
candy because there is no junk in these!<br>
<br>
Win <br>
One winner will 
receive someSurf Sweets candy plus a $20.00 gift certificate to Natural Candy 
Store. <br>

<h3> Green Toys Gardening Kit Review &amp; Giveaway </h3> 
<p>I really think it is great when companies take the initiative to make 
things out recycled materials. Especially when they are using it to make
eco-friendly toys!<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;Gr een Toys Inc. makes an awesome line of classic 
children&rsquo;s toys constructed from recycled plastic and other 
environmentally friendly materials. This helps reduce fossil fuel use and 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improving the overall health and happiness of 
the planet.&quot; </blockquote> <br>
Green Toys makes all of their toys from 
recycled plastic milk jugs and they are all made in the USA. In addition to the 
fact that they use recycled plastic, their packaging is made from recycled 
cardboard and is 100% recyclable itself. No cellophane or annoying little 
twist-ties. Just the bare minimum so there is less waste and the toys are easy 
to remove. All of their toys are also free of BPA and phthalates.<br>
<br>
In 
honor of Earth Day, Green Toys sent me theirIndoor Gardening Kit to try out. 
William was very excited! He's been intently looking at my veggie seedlings for 
a few weeks now so he was very happy to get his own seeds to plant.<br>
<br>

This kit comes with everything you need to plant your seeds: 3 pots, tray, 
shovel, soil and organic seeds. The seeds are Basil, Sunflower and Zinia and 
they give you more than enough in the packets. The soild come sin dehyrdated 
&quot;bricks&quot; that you simply add water to and then atch them exand. We 
planted our seeds on April 17 and today, 6 days later, we alrady have some 
sprouts poking through the soil.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to the gardening 
kit, they also have trucks, a tool set, a tea set and more. I particuarly like 
the Recycling Truck and the Cooware &amp; Dining Set.<br>

One

<h3> The Safe Sippy Review and Giveaway </h3> 
<p>In the last few years there has been a lot of talk about the dangers of 
chemicals found in plastic baby bottles and sippy cups. The most talked about 
is Bisphenol-A (BPA) but there are others to avoid as well like DEHA and 
Phthalates. BPA is a synthetic estrogen used to harden polycarbonate plastics. 
Some of the risks associated with BPA include prostate and breast cancer, 
testicular abnormalities in boys and puberty in girls younger than eight years 
old. DEHA is linked to negative effects on the liver, kidney, spleen, bone 
formation and weight. Phthalates have been linked to liver cancer and kidney 
damage in some animals. They also damage rodent reproductive systems and there 
is concern that they do the same to human infant boys.<br>
<br>
I decided that 
the best thing to do for my boys was to switch tostainless steel sippy cups. We 
do still have some BPA-free plastic cups, but I&rsquo;m trying to gradually 
phase those out as who knows what bad chemical will be found in them tomorrow. 
So I was very excited when Kid Basix sent meThe Safe Sippy to try out.<br>
<br>

<br><br>
The body of The Safe Sippy is made from stainless steel and holds 11 
oz of liquid. Why stainless steel? Because it does not interact with the foods 
and fluids it comes into contact with like plastic does. There are no chemicals 
in the stainless steel so no chemical can leach into the beverages. You will 
find some plastic in this cup on the cap, spout, handle and sleeve. However all 
of the plastics are certified BPA, DEHA and phthalates free. The handle makes 
it easy for little hands to hold and comes off when no longer needed. There is 
a sleeve to keep drinks cold and protect the cup.<br>
<br>
Here is something I 
had no idea about. The spout onThe Safe Sippy is shaped like a straw because 
traditional wide spouts that are on many sippy cups have been found by experts 
to cause speech development problems. With my 2 year old twins both in speech 
therapy, I&rsquo;m taking that point very seriously. I just wish I had found 
that out sooner.<br>
<br>
So how did it test out? I decided to let Josh try 
this cup. No particular reason, just a random choice. But I knew I had to 
choose just one because attempting to let them both try it would lead to 
fighting over who it belongs to. The first thing I noticed about this cup is 
the weight. I have another stainless steel sippy cup that I think is really 
heavy. The Safe Sippy feels so much lighter than that and yet it holds about 2 
more ounces. It also seemed like the liquid flowed much easier through the 
spout. When they use other cups it sounds like they have to suck really hard to 
get the drink out. That was definitely not the case here.<br>
<br>
How does it 
do with leaking? Well as the company states,The Safe Sippy is spill proof but 
cannot be 100% drip proof otherwise it would be hard for children to drink from 
it. Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean this cup is always leaking. The only time it 
leaked for me is when Josh was holding it upside down and shaking it. He does 
this with all his cups and they all leak. The Safe Sippy is also easy to clean. 
While most parts can be washed in the dishwasher (except for the valve), I 
prefer to wash my cups by hand. What&rsquo;s nice is there aren&rsquo;t a bunch 
of pieces to take apart and clean, which is another complaint I have for the 
other stainless steel cup we have.<br>
<br>
Overall, I am extremely pleased 
with The Safe Sippy. Josh loved having a new cup and I loved all the nifty 
features. Most importantly I love that it is free from harmful chemicals. I 
plan on purchasing another one for Luke so they each have one and I can finally 
toss the few plastic cups that we have left.<br>
<br>
Win<br>
One lucky reader 
will win not one, not two, but THREE of The Safe Sippy!! One of each color: 
pink, green and blue.<br>

<h3> Happy Earth Day! </h3> 
<p>So I know I am a tad late on this post, but hey, the day isn't over yet! I 
so badly wanted to do something special for Earth Day this year, but it just 
didn't happen. It has been a rainy week here so far and today was no exception. 
Plus I am suffering from some really awfulmorning all-day sickness that is 
rendering me pretty much useless. We did make it to the zoo on the 18th for 
their &quot;Party for the Planet&quot; event, but it didn't go as well as we 
had hoped. Just think of twin 2 year olds screaming the entire time. Yeah, not 
fun.<br>
<br>
William actually had a school field trip to the police station 
this morning, so I dropped him off for that. And I made sure he was wearing his 
organic Earth Day tee. I love his school but I am disappointed that they did 
absolutely nothing for Earth Day this week. This week's theme is about police 
safety, 911 and strangers. While believe me that stuff is so very important, I 
would have liked them to throw something about the Earth in their somewhere. I 
may have to try and push them for something next year.<br>
<br>
Anyway (lol) I 
would love to hear what everyone else did for Earth Day today! Please share!<br>

<h3> Honeybee Gardens Review &amp; Giveaway </h3> 
<p>It seems to me that the trend with natural cosmetics is that most can be 
pretty expensive. its discouraging to me because the average person like me 
can't afford super expensive makeup and it deters people from making the 
switch. the about a year ago I discoveredHoneybee Gardens. They have natural 
cosmetics, hair care, body care and lip care and all at reasonable prices. I 
love this statement from them:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;At Honeybee Gardens, we believe natural, healthy body care 
and cosmetics should be affordable. We're not rich and we want good products. 
Solution: make them ourselves and share the love with the world!&quot;
</blockquote>I've built up a decent amount of their makeup during that time. I 
started off with theirwater-based nail polish. Their is a good selection of 
colors, I have a few, and they wear well. I do recommend you get their nail 
polish remover to go with it as regular remover doesn't work very well. In 
addition to the nail polish, I also have aJobaColors Eyeliner and a 
PowderColors Mineral Color that I use for eyeshadow. I am more than happy with 
all of them. For comparison sakes, I just went to CVS.com to see what the 
prices of some mineral eye shadows are and the ones they carry range from $6.99 
to $9.99. And those aren't even natural. The Honeybee Gardens mineral color is 
only $4.99.<br>
<br>
Honeybee Gardens was nice enough to send me JobaColors Lip 
Liners to try out. I have't worn lipliner in a very long time so I was happy to 
get some to use. I thought it was funny that the two colors they sent me 
matched the typicl lipstick colors that I wear: brownish-berryish colors. The 
Lip Liner went on very smoothly and looked great. It also lasted a pretty long 
time. Unfortunately, I didn't have a natural lipstick to try with it so I used 
my regular ones. But now that I have this lip liner, I was inspired to order 
some Lipstick from Honeybee Gardens which should be arriving any day now. So 
excited!<br>
<br>
Win <br>
One lucky winner will receive THREE JobaColors Lip 
Liners from Honeybee Gardens. The winner will receive one of each of the 
following colors: Island Spice, Perfection and Zen.<br>

<h3> ENDED Earth's Sweet Pleasures Fudge Review and Giveaway </h3> 
<p>One thing I really wanted to bring you all this week was a tasty organic 
treat. I am a chocoholic, I could eat it all day every day. But I've found it 
difficult to find organic chocolates locally. So I turned to the Internet and 
foundEarth's Sweet Pleasures.<br>
<br>
</p> <br>

<blockquote> Earth's Sweet Pleasures endeavors to make the highest quality 
<strong>organic gourmet fudge</strong> in the world while supporting 
sustainability of the planet and it's inhabitants. Our fudge is<strong>made the 
old-fashioned way</strong>, using an original family recipe that is 25% less 
sweet than conventional fudge, enhancing the intense flavor of the award 
winning rich,<strong>dark chocolate</strong>. Every ingredient in our fudge is 
all natural certified organic and the delicious dark chocolate is grown by
<strong>fair trade</strong> farmers in Central and South America. By purchasing 
our fudge you help<strong>sustain the rainforest</strong> where cacao trees are 
grown in the shade of the canopy. A portion of our proceeds go to environmental 
and humanitarian organizations that promote<strong>economic fairness</strong> 
for cacao farmers and their families.</blockquote>At Earth's Sweet Pleasures 
you will findRich Rainforest Dark Fudge, both plain and with walnuts. The fudge 
with walnuts is their bestseller. All of their fudge is made with organic, fair 
trade chocolate. They were kind enough to send me asample of the Rich 
Rainforest Dark Fudge with Walnuts to taste. I actually received it just the 
other day and let me tell you, it took a great amount of willpower to not eat 
the entire piece all at once because it is so delicious. Very rich and creamy 
and literally melts in your mouth. Not only does it taste great, but its 
comforting to know that there are no artificial yucky ingredients. The 
ingredient list on my sample fudge bar reads as follows:<br>

<blockquote> Ingredients (All Organic): Evaporated Cane Juice, Fair-Trade 
Chocloate - 65% Bittersweet, Marshmallow Creme, Walnuts, contains Dairy (Half 
&amp; Half), Natural Oil Blend, Vanilla Extract, Love &amp; Gratitude. 
</blockquote>Of course the best ingredients are the love and gratitude. There 
are no substitutes for that!<br>

<h3> Going Green: Reusable Feminine Products </h3> 
<p>Since I have a Lunapads giveaway going on, I thought now would be a good 
time to elaborate more on reusable feminine products. That's right boys, 
another post about periods. Now is your chance to quickly click on a different 
post of mine before we get into it.<br>
<br>
I've already discussed the 
benefits of giving cloth pads a try. Just think about all those disposable ones 
that end up in landfills ever year, the petroleum that goes into making the 
plastic in them, or the chlorine used to bleach them. And I really can't stress 
enough how comfortable cloth pads are. Well, at least the ones I have tried. I 
barely even notice them.<br>
<br>
When I first joined the &quot;green 
movement&quot;, the thought of cloth pads truly grossed me out and I said to 
myself that I would never go that far. Ha. Now I love them. I've only tried 2 
brands:Glad Rags and Lunapads, and I have been extremely pleased with both. 
I've had my Glad Rags for a while and they are still going strong. Plus their 
overnight ones are awesome - no leaks! I love that theLunapads let you just 
change the liner as needed instead of changing the entire bad. They also make
overnighters which I want to try too. There are lots of others out there you 
can try aswell. I know a lot of people have said good things about Ama'z Padz 
as well. Do you have any other you can share with us?<br>
<br>
One type of 
product I have not talked about yet are menstrual cups. Yes, these used to 
gross me out too. I would read about other mamas trying them and I just thought 
there was no way they would be comfortable and it would be such a mess. Boy was 
I wrong. The same time I bought my first cloth pads, I bought a cup as well. I 
opted for theMoon Cup over the Diva Cup because at the time it was on sale and 
considerably less money.<br>
<br>
I was never a big fan of tampons. They were 
always pretty uncomfortable for me, especially after child birth (which is kind 
of ironic). So I was nervous that theMoon Cup would be the same way. I was 
pleasantly surprised that it was so much better. The first cycle was a learning 
one, but by the second cycle I had figured out how to insert it properly and 
now I don't even notice it is there.<br>
<br>
If you think you want to give a 
menstrual cup a try, Irecommend visiting this informative review. This woman 
tried out a bunch of different ones and then lists all of her findings here. I 
read this entire thing before making my purchase and ithelped me decided on the 
Moon Cup. She also has tips ondifferent folds for inserting that you can try.
<br><br>
So I hope you can maybe consider trying out some reusable menstrual 
products. Believe me, I know it can sound gross and be intimidating. But once 
you try it you will realize how much better it is. Have you already made the 
switch? Which brands/products areyour favorite?<br>

<h3> Ecostore USA Review and Giveaway </h3> 
<p>All 3 of my boys suffer from dry skin and eczema, especially Luke. His 
eczema is quite bad and my pediatrician said what he has is hereditary and 
there actually isn't anything I can use to cure it. So it is important for me 
to use washes and lotions that are easy on the chemicals and therefor easy 
their skin. So I was really excited when I foundEcostore USA and their natural 
baby care products.<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;Our mission is to focus on individual health issues. Our 
ingredients are the principle factor in helpingEcostore achieve this goal. By 
eliminating hazardous toxins that are the basis of so many conventional 
cleaning products we not only help you but keep our planet in the best shape 
possible. Doing Good by Nature means taking the wonderful gifts that nature 
offers and developing plant based products that are safe, authentic and really 
work.&quot; </blockquote>I was so thankful to receive some samples of Ecostore's
 baby products. I received theb ody wash, shampoo and lotion and immediately 
started using them on the boys. The first thing I noticed was the scent - I 
love it! That's saying a lotfor me because I am sensitive to scents. So many 
can trigger headaches for me. But theEcostore baby care line has a nice, clean, 
fresh scent. When the boys are out of the bath I love cuddling up with them and 
smelling their hair. I've also noticed improvement in Josh's skin. He 
definitely had the most mildeczema of the three. He would occasionally get 
really rough patches around his elbows. However in the several weeks I've been 
using these, that has happened much less. I also want to mention that a little 
goes a long way with the shampoo and body wash. It lathers really nicely with 
only a small amount; I'd say I use about dime sized portion. Just be careful 
when pouring because it can come out fast!<br>
<br>
Of course let's not forget 
the best part: &quot;No Nasty Chemicals&quot;. All of the Ecostore USA products 
are free fromparabens, SLS, phosphates, chlorine, propylene glycol and other 
chemicals that pose dangers to our bodies and our environment. I'm so jealous 
of you all that live near aMeijer store, where the Ecostore USA line is 
exclusively sold in the United States.<br>
<br>
Ecostore USA has much more than 
baby care products. They have laundry care, pet care dish cleaners, household 
cleaners and so much more. I'm anxious to try out the Cream Cleanser on my 
cooktop!<br>
<br>
Shop <br>
In honor of Earth month, receive free shipping on 
all orders of $25.00 more. Good for the entire month of April 2009.<br>

<h3> CLOSED GreenSmart Bottles To Bags Giveaway! </h3> 
<p>Do you ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles that you 
recycle? What are they being recycled into?GreenSmart is one company that is 
taking those recycled bottles and turning them into cool bags! The process of 
turning a used water bottle into a bag is quite interesting and you can read 
all about ithere. (This might be used for an extra entry!)<br>
<br>
In 1995, 
Tom and Debbie Larsen founded bag company Shoreline. At that time, there were 
no options for eco-friendly materials or fabrics. However in 2007, with 
recycled materials now readily available, they committed to converting all 
items they make to green material composition. Now they have a great selection 
ofeco-friendly bags: laptop jackets, sleeves and messenger style laptop bags 
and also totes and shoulder bags.<br>
</p> All fabrics used for the GreenSmart 
Bottles 2 Bags are derived from certified 100% post-consumer recycled PET water 
and soda bottles. If you are wondering, PET is plastic #1. The inside of each 
bag has a bright green lining imprinted with their recycle logo, to remind you 
of your green purchase. And a cool feature in their store is they will tell you 
how many bottles were used to make the bag. For example, theHorizontal 
Messenger Bag uses 30 bottles which saved energy equal to 236 laptop hours. As 
of October 2008 GreenSmart Bottles 2 bags had used 555,169 16oz PET bottles 
which saved 369 million Btus. That's equal to 4.3 million laptop hours!<br>
<br>
Shop <br>
In honor of the 39th annual Earth Day, GreenSmart is running an Earth 
Month promotion and offering a discount promo for 39% off any order. That is a 
HUGE savings!! The promo code isKZ39MX and it is good through May 1, 2009. <br>

GreenSmart is generously awarding one winner a laptop jacket or 
sleeve of their choice. (I am so jealous by the way, I want one!)<br>

<h3> Kaboogie Repurposed Leather Moccasins Review </h3> 
<p>There are truly so many great shops over on Etsy, especially eco-friendly 
ones. So I was very excited when I was contacted by the mom behindKaboogie! 
Kaboogie makes baby shoes, moccasins, wristlets and more all from repurposed 
leather (the shoe soles are made from new suede). I think it is great when 
someone can find a cool way to reuse things! Why does she do this?&quot;The 
pieces I recycle are headed for the landfill, or in bulk rag shipments to third 
world countries. I'd much rather see them have new life as baby shoes to hand 
down and pass along!&quot;<br>
<br>
I was sent a pair of baby moccasins to 
borrow so that I could get an up close and personal look at them. The pair I 
looked at was the same style as these, only a darker brown. (the photos I took 
were fuzzy).<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
Firstly, they are adorable, just look at 
them! I really love the fringe. These moccasins are incredibly soft too. The 
uppers are made from repurposed suede and the soles are made from new non-skid 
suede. I wish my twins were younger because these would be so cute on them. 
(They've entered that terrible twos, everything is a tantrum phase). You can 
also find other baby shoes there, like thesepretty pink Maryjanes. Wouldn't 
these look great on your little princess?<br>
<br>
Now Kaboogie is more than 
just shoes. You will also find leather pillow covers as well as purses and 
wristlets here. I love the look of thisCherry Blossoms Wristlet. <br>
<br>

Everything about his bag is recycled! The flowers are made of pink recycled 
suede, the branches of cream recycled leather and the bag of brown recycled 
leather. Even the brass zipper is reclaimed!<br>
<br>
Shop <br>
Kaboogie is 
offering free shipping to all Green Mama's Pad readers. Just leave a comment 
here and then when you place your order put &quot;greenmamaspad&quot; in 
&quot;message to seller&quot; and Kaboogie will refund your shipping.<br>
<br>

So hop on over toKaboogie to see what she has. If you comment here telling me 
what you like, you may just earn extra entries into some of my Earth Day Blog 
Party giveaways!<br>
