<p>In&nbsp;January 2004 <b>Vincent Nnanna</b>, an experienced solar cooking 
advocate, held a two-day workshop with members of<b>Canadian World Youth</b> 
who are volunteering in the south-central part of Benin near Bohicon. The 25 
participants learned how to build and use solar box cookers and panel cookers (
<b>Solar Cookers International</b>&#146;s CooKits).&nbsp;Project Coordinator <b>
Ed Carswell&nbsp;</b>took the opportunity to demonstrate how heated water and a 
Water Pasteurization Indicator (WAPI) work in conjunction to pasteurize 
drinking water.&nbsp;Since the workshop the youth have been traveling around 
the rural outskirts of Bohicon teaching households how to make and use solar 
cookers. Subsequent workshops are being planned for schools in Cotonou.</p>

<p><b>Burkina</b> <b>Faso</b> </p> 
<p>The La Trame documentary film studio has released Bon app&eacute;tit, 
Monsieur Soleil, a film about solar cooking in Burkina Faso. (It has French 
subtitles.) The film covers the essential points of solar cooking, the 
acceptance of these devices by the population, the advantages achieved by using 
them (savings in money and/or time), and their contribution to fighting 
deforestation. The film is a tool to inform people living in countries with 
energy problems about other ways to cook. It also serves to introduce this 
cooking method to decision makers in government agencies and NGOs. La Trame 
plans to release versions of the film subtitled in English, Spanish and German, 
and dubbed in Bambara, Dioula and Moor&eacute;.</p>

<p>Here&#146;s a tip from the <b>Solare-Bruecke</b> Web site (
http://solare-bruecke.org): you can bake with a parabolic cooker by placing 
your baking pan inside a larger, covered pot with space all around the baking 
pan.&nbsp;In this way, you don't get a &#147;hot spot&#148; on the baking pan. 
Instead, inside the outer pot it is more like an oven and the heat is more 
evenly distributed.</p> 
<p><b>Malawi</b> </p> 
<p><b>Lilongwe Rotary Club</b> has embarked on a solar cooker project in the 
central region of Malawi. The project is organized by a team of researchers led 
by<b>Mr. Hosana Nyirenda</b>, a solar cooking advocate who first contacted <b>
Solar Cookers International</b> in 1998. The pilot phase is expected to last 
one year, with a budget of US $27,000. Additional funds are needed.</p>

<p><b>South Africa</b> </p> 
<p>Many foods &#8213; such as beans, grains, stews and soups &#8213; require 
long, fuel intensive simmering periods to cook properly. A retained-heat cooker 
can finish off these dishes without fuel (or sunlight if solar cooking) and can 
keep cooked foods warm for long periods of time. A retained-heat cooker, also 
known as a&nbsp;fireless cooker or &#147;hay box&#148;, is an insulated 
enclosure in which is set a pot of food that has been brought to a 
boil,&nbsp;allowing it to continue to cook after being removed from its heat 
source. Solar product designer<b>Richard Pocock</b> calls his version the 
Wonder Cushion. It is a great companion to a solar cooker, allowing for food to 
cook or stay warm as the sun sets. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Wonder Cushion is made from two large disks of material sewn together 
in such a way as to create a base circle, on which the pot rests, and a series 
of pockets like the petals on a daisy. These pockets, and the base circle, are 
filled with an insulating material such as vermiculite, sawdust, feathers, 
shredded paper or wool. When sewing up the pockets make a fold over tube for a 
drawstring. A carrying handle can also be added. An insulated, circular pillow 
must also be sewn. This pillow is placed on the pot&#146;s lid before cinching 
the unit with a drawstring, preventing heat loss through the top of the pot. 
Mr. Pocock suggests placing the pot in a heat-resistant bag before it goes in 
the Wonder Cushion in case of food spillage, but it isn&#146;t necessary.</p>

<p>An inexpensive solar collector, developed in Brazil, has been used by 
growers and nurseries for the past decade to disinfest soil. Solar methods 
reduce or eliminate the need for methyl bromide, a toxic, ozone-depleting 
pesticide. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The solar collector is comprised of six dark-colored metal tubes, each 15 
centimeters in diameter, placed in a wooden box 1.5 meters long, 1.0 meter wide 
and 0.3 meter deep. Transparent plastic film allows sunlight in through the top 
of the box, while aluminum foil lines the bottom of the box to increase 
heating. Soil or other substrates are placed in the tubes through an upper 
hatch during the early morning and recovered through the lower hatch 24 hours 
later. Midday soil temperatures in the tubes reach 70-80&ordm;C. According to<b>
Dr. Raquel Ghini</b>, a plant pathologist, one sunny day is enough to control 
several plant pathogens, including Fusarium, Pythium, Sclerotium, Sclerotinia 
and Meloidogyne.</p>

<p> <b>Dr. Paul Funk</b>, a solar cooking expert and previous <b>Solar Cookers 
International</b> (SCI) board member, sends news that after many years of 
effort an official standard for testing and reporting solar cooker performance 
has been adopted by the<b>American Society of Agricultural Engineers</b>. (Food 
and process engineering fall under the realm of this organization.) These 
efforts were initiated by the Test Standard Committee at 1997&#146;s Third 
World Conference on Solar Cooking sponsored by Avinashilingam University and 
SCI. The standards are available on SCI&#146;s Solar Cooking Archive:
www.solarcooking.org/asae_test_std.pdf. </p> 
<p><b>Abe McBride</b>, a student in Greenville, Tennessee (USA), researched 
solar cookers for a science fair project. He found them to be fairly expensive 
so he decided to make some for himself using salvage materials. The amazing 
part of this story? Abe did all the work by himself, and he is five years old! 
He built three types of solar cookers &#8213; a solar box cooker, a panel-type 
cooker, and a concentrating cooker &#8213; using tools his grandfather gave 
him. When the cookers were finished, Abe tested several recipes and pasteurized 
water in them.</p> 
<p><b>ASIA</b> <b>AND</b> <b> PACIFIC</b> </p> 
<p><b>Afghanistan</b> </p> 
<p>Pre-formed parts and cutting jigs for 400 &#147;SOS Sport&#148; solar box 
cookers from the<b>Solar Oven Society</b> were shipped to Afghanistan last 
year. These cookers were assembled locally, providing needed work opportunities.
<b>Gordon Magney</b> &#8213; formerly of <b>SERVE</b>, a relief organization 
that spread solar cookers in Pakistan and Afghanistan &#8213; is leading a 
pilot partnership project implemented by<b>International Foundation of Hope</b> 
and<b>Global Hope Network</b> in Istalif village, a suburb of Kabul. Nearly all 
of the SOS Sport cookers have since been purchased. Tests are now being 
conducted as to the usefulness of parabolic solar cookers in that area.</p> 
<p>Thanks to <b>Virginie Mitchem</b>, Task Force Coordinator of <b>Solar 
Cookers International</b>&#146;s Ad Hoc Committee on Afghanistan, for keeping 
us posted on these and other events.</p> 
<p><b>China</b> </p> 
<p> <b>Horn Relief</b>, a local Somali NGO, recently imported several solar 
cookers from China with the assistance of a small grant from<b>Mrs. Li Hsiao-li
</b> of Beijing. The cookers are being used in the Bosaso region of northeast 
Somalia. It is an arid region with a lot of sunshine and limited fuel wood 
resources so solar cooking has obvious attractions. (The head of Horn Relief 
won the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2001 for her work in environmental 
conservation, in particular her efforts to control the charcoal trade in 
northeastern Somalia that is decimating the little remaining tree cover in the 
country to supply an export market to the Middle East.)</p> 
<p>The cooker&#146;s parabolic mirrors are made of cast iron with a highly 
reflective aluminum tape comprising the reflective surface. This tape has 
proved to be durable, yet repairable if necessary. Weighing 80 kilograms, the 
cookers are sturdy and stable in high winds. Tracking of the sun is simple due 
to rotational capabilities around its vertical axis. Tilt of the reflective 
panels is also adjustable. The cookers come with reflective areas ranging from 
1.5 to 2.5 square meters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&#147;The solar cookers are great,&#148; says a new Bosaso solar cook. 
&#147;One of them is working at our office. There is always something on it. 
Food, tea, water. Some months ago the solar cooker cooked for 28 persons.&#148; 
The Chinese cookers cost approximately US $100 each including sea transport 
charges from China.</p>

<p> <b>Amir Mahdi Komarizadeh</b>, a graduate student at Azad University in 
Iran, has designed, built and tested a concentrating-type solar cooker called 
Vafa. It consists of a segmented frame and four mirrored fiberglass panels with 
an aperture area of 1.5 square meters. Each panel is adjustable. For safety 
reasons the panels are designed to provide a focal area of 225 square 
centimeters instead of a focal point. This design allows for maximum 
temperatures of about 250&ordm;C. The advantages of his semi-parabolic design 
include lower material cost compared to full parabolic design, easy access to 
the cooking pot, and protection of mirrored surfaces from possible food 
spillage. Additional stability is gained by allowing wind to pass between the 
four panels. On clear days in Tehran most dishes will cook in 30-90 minutes in 
a pressure cooker.</p>

<p><b>Japan</b> </p> 
<p>Saveur magazine recently published a 1955 photo showing <b>Mr. Seizo Goto
</b> of Tokyo demonstrating his parabolic solar cooker on top of the 72-story 
RCA building in New York City, where he successfully cooked rice despite cool 
air temperatures of -6&ordm;C. The photo originally ran on the front page of 
the New York Herald Tribune, and the event was reported on television and radio.
<b>Ms. Yasuko Torii</b>, an avid solar cook and promoter, was inspired by this 
discovery of early solar cooking research in Japan and reports her findings on 
Mr. Goto&#146;s pioneering work.</p>

<p>Seizo Goto (1891-1982), founder of telescope and planetarium company <b>
Goto Optical Manufacturing</b>, built two parabolic solar cookers in 1947 with 
a subsidy from Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Over the years he built several 
other solar cookers &#8213; some quite sophisticated &#8213; and displayed them 
throughout Japan and China in the 1950s. Mr. Goto was invited by Stanford 
University&#146;s Dr. Marjil to display a solar cooker at an international 
solar energy symposium in Arizona (USA) in November 1955. After this event he 
was invited by the Rockefeller Foundation to cook atop the RCA building.</p>

<p><b>Nepal</b> </p> 
<p> Since 1996 Rotary has funded small solar cooker projects in the village of 
Bhandar, Nepal. Since our report on these efforts last year an additional 56 
SK-14 parabolic solar cookers have been disseminated, bringing the total to 122 
cookers in this village of roughly 400 families. Leading these efforts has been
<b>Klaus Schulte</b>, a Rotarian from Sweden. The cookers were produced by 
silversmiths in Kathmandu, transported by bus and carried over the Himalayas in 
big baskets. The Project Manager is<b>Temba Lama</b>. </p> 
<p>Excerpts from a report by <b>Devendra Ghimire</b>, a beneficiary of the 
solar cooking projects in Bhandar, follow: &#147;I received a solar cooker in 
November 2000. &#133; It can boil up to 40 liters of water during solar day. 
The water is used for taking baths, cleaning dishes, making tea and for cooking 
food. &#133; It is very easy and useful to boil beans, potatoes and other 
beans, which usually consumes more kerosene. It is found that it saves from Rs. 
1350 to Rs. 1500 in Kerosene in a month. &#133; It protects environment from 
pollution and protects diseases caused by smoke. It helps to preserve natural 
environment. It reduces from eye diseases, like eyes hurt, eyes being black and 
eyes being swelled. &#133; It is very easy for us to make tea and cook food in 
the solar heater together even when I am studying books in a day. It also makes 
easy to farmers they can consume more of their time for farming by cooking 
their food in the solar cooker easily. &#133; I have to tolerate a lot of 
smokes coming inside my house when someone cooks food for us and make animal 
seeds. Now we don't have such problems. It is like a reviving medicine to my 
family and to the entire [village].&#148;</p> 
<p> Solar cookers benefit the Bhandar economy: here, a solar cooker is used to 
melt honey for saleable skin ointment</p>

<p><b>Sri</b> <b>Lanka</b> </p> 
<p><b>The EMACE Foundation</b> continues its efforts to spread solar cooking 
in Sri Lanka, particularly war-torn northern and eastern regions.</p> 
<p>Workshops were recently held in the Vavuniya district and orders for 50 
solar box cookers were filled. Twenty parabolic solar cookers &#8213; designed 
and provided by<b>Dominic Michaelis</b> of <b>Solar Energy Ltd.</b> &#8213; 
were also distributed. According to EMACE, &#147;Women in particular are 
benefiting from the cookers as they enable them &#133; to spend more time away 
from cooking and to save money otherwise spent on firewood. Many have used the 
extra time and money to start their own micro-businesses &#8213; some have even 
used the cookers themselves to gain extra income by selling cakes and sweets 
prepared in them.&#148;</p> 
<p>Demand for cookers among these communities is currently outstripping 
supply. EMACE is looking for additional support to assist with production and 
transport costs. EMACE recently began to produce its own solar box cookers, 
helping to keep costs down and ensure the project&#146;s viability.</p>

<p> SCI board looks toward 2010 </p> 
<p>By <b>Bev Blum</b>, SCI Executive Director </p> 
<p>At its exciting spring meeting, <b>Solar Cookers International</b>&#146;s 
dynamic, diverse board of directors set six program goals for the year 2010, 
each embracing major new initiatives. You&#146;ll be hearing more as we map out 
the details and seek support for major undertakings. The discussions were 
enriched by three professional facilitators who generously donated their 
services:<b>Heidi Kolbe</b>, <b>Shahrzad Saderi</b> and <b>Leslie Parks</b>. To 
them we are most grateful.</p> 
<p>SCI&#146;s top priority for 2010 is independent spread of solar cooking 
beyond Nyakach&#8213; its &#147;Sunny Solutions&#148; project community in 
western Kenya &#8213; to all suitable parts of Kenya. We also continue to 
support a refugee-run solar cooking cooperative in Kakuma refugee camp.</p> 
<p>  Refugee <b>Shadrack Alumai</b> finishes painting the new <b>Solar Cooking 
Cooperative</b> (SOCOCO) building</p> 
<p>A close second priority is the mobilization of solar cooking leaders 
worldwide for joint advocacy toward public and private support to spread solar 
cooking for health, economic and environmental benefits in the twenty most 
needy countries. This will include two international meetings.</p> 
<p>Two other priorities are 1) to provide technical assistance in several 
selected countries to governments or other major institutions wanting to 
promote solar cooking, and 2) to select one or more additional countries for 
multi-year projects over the next decade.</p> 
<p>Our often-copied and translated educational resources support all of the 
above initiatives and need expanding in scope and accessibility. Our respected 
worldwide query-response service continues to assist thousands of solar cooking 
advocates worldwide.</p> 
<p>The board elected a new board member, <b>Bruce Stahlberg</b>, an energy 
efficiency expert and businessman who has promoted household energy efficiency 
in Latin America. The board also created two adjunct groups &#8213; SCI 
Advocates and International Advisors &#8213; to honor SCI volunteers and key 
solar cooker promoters respectively.</p> 
<p>You, our supporters and advocates, help shift the paradigm toward 
sustainable solutions for future generations. If you haven&#146;t yet joined or 
renewed for this year, please do so. We&#146;ll put your gift to work 
immediately. Thanks for your visionary support.</p> 
<p> Preview of coming attractions: a worldwide solar cooking movement </p> 
<p>By <b>Ram&oacute;n Coyle</b>, SCI Database Coordinator </p> 
<p> Responses to a recent <b>Solar Cookers International</b> (SCI) survey 
indicate that a few hundred individuals, nonprofit organizations, research 
centers and alternative energy businesses have produced well over 100,000 solar 
cookers.</p> 
<p>By January 2004, 234 individuals and organizations had responded to 
SCI&#146;s 2003 survey of solar cooking promoters.</p> 
<p>Responses came from solar cooking promoters in 67 different countries, 
including 18 in India, 12 in Nigeria, 11 in Kenya, 11 in Uganda, 10 in 
Tanzania, nine in South Africa, six in Nepal, six in Haiti, and five each in 
Argentina, Nepal, Mali and The Gambia.</p> 
<p>No single type of solar cooker stands out as the &#147;cooker of 
choice&#148; for promoters. Respondents are involved with promoting the very 
large and powerful Scheffler community kitchens, SCI&#146;s humble, low-cost 
&#147;CooKit&#148; panel-type cooker, and many cookers in between. Other 
cookers include parabolic-type cookers, concentrator trough cookers and a 
variety of box cookers.</p> 
<p>Of the 234 respondents, 130 teach others to solar cook, 120 build solar 
cookers and 107 demonstrate solar cooking in various public forums. For example,
<b>Dr. Michael G&ouml;tz</b> of Switzerland demonstrates solar cooking at 
various fairs and festivals, serving delicious solar pancakes to stimulate 
people&#146;s appetites for more solar cooking knowledge.</p> 
<p>Fifty-four of the respondents report that they sell solar cookers, in many 
cases at subsidized prices. Seventy respondents report that they teach people 
to be solar cooking instructors. Collectively they have trained over 1,700 
instructors.</p> 
<p><b>Some leading promoters</b> </p> 
<p><b>Gordon Magney</b>, now based in Kabul, Afghanistan, reports 21,000 solar 
box cookers produced in a long career involving service to Afghani communities 
both in refugee camps in Pakistan and in Afghanistan itself. He has also 
promoted solar cooking in Tajikistan.</p> 
<p>Rotarian <b>Wilfred Pimentel</b> reports that 20,000 solar cookers have 
been produced as a result of his efforts to teach solar cooking through 
partnerships among Rotary organizations, frequently supported by Girl Guide 
solar cooking instructors.</p> 
<p>Supporting Mr. Pimentel&#146;s estimate are the responses from an alliance 
known as &#147;<b>Four Rotary Clubs of Bulawayo</b>&#148; and the <b>Girl 
Guides of Zimbabwe</b>. These groups jointly have produced and distributed 
6,500 cookers in southern Zimbabwe in a little over six years. Meanwhile, in 
Zambia, the Girl Guide Association, with aid from a local Rotary group, has 
taught 500 people to make and use their own solar cookers.</p> 
<p>The <b>Seyhan Rotary Club</b> in southeastern Turkey reports nearly 2,000 
solar panel cookers produced and distributed &#151; over 800 through training 
workshops and 1,000 supplied in an earthquake disaster relief effort in Turkey.
</p> 
<p><b>Dieter Seifert</b> &#8213; inventor of the SK-14 and similar parabolic 
cookers &#8213; estimates that about 16,000 of his cookers have been produced 
worldwide.</p> 
<p><b>The Sunstove Organization</b>, based in South Africa, says it has sold 
12,000 of its Sunstove&reg; box cookers.<b>Mission Mazahua</b>, in Mexico, is 
one of the producers of the Sunstove&reg;, and it reports 600 cookers made at 
its center in Mexico.</p> 
<p><b>Group ULOG</b> of Switzerland reports 10,000 cookers distributed. ULOG 
is best known for its sturdy box cookers that are used in many countries, but 
ULOG also promotes parabolic cookers and the Scheffler solar kitchens.</p> 
<p>A grassroots organization in Uganda &#151; <b>Solar Connect Association </b>
&#151; also reports 10,000 solar cookers produced. These are mostly cardboard 
solar panel cookers made by and for the new solar cooks themselves.</p> 
<p><b>Javahar Maniar</b>, a retired solar box cooker business owner in Baroda, 
India, reports that in his career he produced and sold 10,000 solar cookers.</p>
<p>Other survey respondents who reported producing/distributing 250 or more 
cookers included these:</p>

<p>In a show of inspiring persistence, <b>Noel Bourke</b> of <b>Sola Kookas</b>
 in Perth, Australia, reports hand-building 45 solar box cookers per year for 
the past 10 years.</p> 
<p><b>Ideas for spreading solar cooking </b> </p> 
<p>Many solar cooking promoters try to make use of existing institutions whose 
mission is compatible with teaching solar cooking. For example, even though our 
survey did not ask a specific question about schools, nearly 10 percent of the 
respondents volunteered the information that their strategy involves spreading 
solar cooking through universities, colleges, secondary schools, primary 
schools or training centers.</p> 
<p><b>Salifu Mahama</b> in Ghana, for example, reports teaching 1,000 students 
how to make solar box cookers using packing cases and cardboard.<b>Hans Bekaert
</b> of Belgium reports that his organization developed an educational program 
for the Belgian government to promote renewable energy in schools. In Sagara, 
Karnataka, India,<b>K. Venkatesha</b> reports that a solar cooking awareness 
program exists in 20 schools.<b>Rayner Sturton</b> in Australia notes that by 
teaching solar cooking to his primary school students, he is able to get the 
parents interested and involved in solar cooking.</p> 
<p><b>The Girl Guides Association of Zambia</b> looks at the question from a 
fresh angle. When they invite adults to a workshop on solar cooking, they 
provide a day school environment for the children, so that the parents are free 
for the workshop and the children are also stimulated.</p> 
<p>Besides schools, a number of promoters make use of existing health networks 
to promote solar cooking. &#147;Rural primary health clinics are centers for 
spreading solar cooking,&#148; reports<b>Alice Hoenecke</b> of the program she 
initiated in Madagascar, where 1,400 families have built solar panel cookers 
for themselves.<b>The Solar Health/Samburu Health Project</b> in Kenya trains 
community health workers and traditional birth attendants to promote solar 
cooking along with their other community work.</p> 
<p><b>Women for Peace</b> in South Africa teach people to make their own 
cardboard solar cookers. After people have mastered solar cooking, they can 
then apply for help in making permanent, metal cookers.</p> 
<p><b>Help SCI identify solar cooking leaders in your country</b></p> 
<p>In mid-2003, SCI again began taking the pulse of the solar cooking movement 
by surveying 4,000 international readers of the Solar Cooker Review and some 
selected promoters based in the United States. A story on this page discusses 
preliminary results of that survey.</p>

<p> Solar cookers: a tool for reaching UN Millennium Development Goals </p> 
<p>By <b>Pascale Dennery</b>, SCI Program Manager </p> 
<p>The United Nations Millennium Development Goals, adopted by all 191 United 
Nations Member States, are a roadmap towards the next decade of human 
development on a global scale. Solar cookers are a boon: they address all eight 
goals with their multiple social, health and environmental benefits for 
sun-rich communities, as illustrated below:</p> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Solar cookers free up scarce money as a result of savings on purchases of 
traditional cooking fuels &#8213; a significant expense for those with incomes 
less than one dollar a day. These savings can be used on additional food.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Achieve universal primary education</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Children, particularly girls, start helping at a young age with the 
collection of small branches and agricultural residues for use as cooking fuel. 
In areas of acute shortages, this task interferes with school attendance and 
eats up study time. Solar cookers allow children to spend more time in class.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Promote gender equality and empower women</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The harsh realities of fuel wood scarcity have a disproportionate impact on 
women and undermine their ability to generate income through agriculture or 
small businesses. Solar cooker use at home or work allows women to fulfill 
their responsibility as the main provider of food and fuel for daily meals.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Reduce child mortality</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Waterborne diseases are a primary cause of death among children under the 
age of five. When fuel is scarce and expensive, it becomes even harder to heed 
public health messages about boiling water. Solar cookers can heat water to 
pasteurization temperatures using free solar energy.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Improve maternal health</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Smoke from cooking fires is increasingly recognized as a major health 
threat, particularly for women and young girls in developing countries. The 
health effects include acute respiratory infections, eye infections, asthma and 
increased risk of tuberculosis and cataracts. Smoke is also linked to low-birth 
weight and infant mortality. Solar cooking is clean and smoke-free, and can 
benefit the health of all family members.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Acute and chronic illnesses are related to many aspect of family 
social-economic status. Caring for a sick family member takes time away from 
various livelihood activities and death of an adult family member can lead to 
loss of income. Solar cookers can be left unattended, so that they are 
user-friendly for the sick as well as those caring for them.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Ensure environmental sustainability</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Over half the world&#146;s population relies on wood and charcoal for 
cooking daily meals. The environmental impact of this dependence is far 
reaching &#8213; loss of tree cover, soil depletion, carbon dioxide emissions, 
etc. Solar cookers transform clean solar energy into valuable heat for cooking 
and water pasteurization.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Goal: <i>Develop a global partnership for development</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Widespread access to solar cookers by those who will benefit most will 
require partnerships between the public and private sectors, on a local, 
national and international scale.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Many tool and strategies will be needed to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals by 2015. Solar cookers deserve recognition as one of these 
tools.</p> 
<p> Portrait of a new solar cook </p> 
<p><b>Susana Mazzolli</b>, an active solar cooking promoter in Argentina, 
provided this portrait of<b>Josefina Araujo</b>, a new solar cook living on the 
outskirts of Buenos Aires.</p> 
<p>Ms. Araujo is married, with one adult child, but she is also raising her 
three teenage nephews. In 2002 she took a solar cooking course offered by the 
government of the city of Buenos Aires as part of poverty alleviation program. 
Ms. Araujo works three hours per day in a local school in exchange for the 
city&#146;s aid.</p> 
<p>In July 2003 she was supplied with one of the cookers built in her course 
and has become a regular user. She keeps it on the small patio behind her 
kitchen. Although her neighborhood is dense with houses, Ms. Araujo&#146;s 
patio has a good northern exposure. Since Buenos Aires is nearly 35 degrees 
south of the equator, a northern exposure is essential for solar cooking. The 
cooker is on a small stand and can be easily covered with a plastic sheet and 
moved under a small roof on rainy days to keep it perfectly dry.</p> 
<p>Because the adults eat lunch at work and the children eat lunch at school, 
the main meal of the day is the evening meal. Ms. Araujo&#146;s approach to 
solar cooking is to start the food in her solar cooker before she goes to work. 
After her three-hour shift, she returns in the early afternoon to find 
everything cooked. She then keeps it in the cooler until dinnertime and quickly 
reheats it on a gas stove before serving it to her family.</p> 
<p>By using solar energy, each canister of cooking gas lasts an extra 15 days 
or longer, saving the family substantial funds.</p> 
<p>&#147;It is a great help,&#148; Ms. Araujo says of the solar cooker. 
&#147;The meals don&#146;t burn. I can happily leave the pots with the food 
until whenever I return home, and the food will be cooked without being burnt 
or sticking to the pot.&#148;</p> 
<p>Ms. Araujo says that, except for fried foods, everything can be cooked in a 
solar cooker. Her favorites dishes include rice, polenta, vegetables, potatoes, 
soups, seeds, sauces, biscuits, rolls, cakes, eggs and lentils.</p>

<p> &#147;Cooking in a piece of cardboard &#133; you have to see it to believe 
it&#148; </p> 
<p>By <b>Wietske Jongbloed </b> </p> 
<p>For the past three years a group of professional women &#8213; <b>The 
Association of Women Engineers</b>(AFIMA) &#8213; have worked to spread solar 
cooker use throughout Mali. Their promotional slogan is &#147;Cooking in a 
piece of cardboard &#133; you have to see it to believe it&#148;.</p> 
<p>AFIMA invited me in May 2001 to introduce the CooKit (<b>Solar Cookers 
International</b>&#146;s panel-style solar cooker) and its fabrication to their 
members. About 30 participants took the week-long course. At the end of the 
week they organized a big reception to mark the launch of their CooKit 
activities.</p> 
<p>After the course I went with two AFIMA members to two villages south of 
Bamako (the capital) and two villages far to the northwest of the country to 
introduce the CooKit. People were astonished about the cooking heat generated 
by the sun. Some women could not believe that there was no fire under the 
cardboard. On the covers of some of the pots I placed an oven thermometer and 
some people thought that we were cheating, that the thermometers were producing 
some sort of cooking gas. (We no longer use thermometers when demonstrating!) 
Not only women but also men took interest. Men said that they could take the 
CooKit and ingredients to the field and in that way their wives would not be 
obligated to follow them &#8213; often more than six miles &#8213; to bring 
them their midday meal.</p> 
<p>Larger CooKits are often requested so that meals, particularly millet 
porridge, can be cooked in greater quantities. Research on larger CooKits is 
being conducted. We find that poor rural women dare to spend their precious 
money on the CooKit only if it is highly subsidized, and packaged with the 
requisite black cooking pot, heat-resistant cooking bags, and a cotton carrying 
bag. They have very little money, if any, to spend on apparatus they have to 
try out.</p> 
<p>Two hundred CooKits for these early courses and demonstrations were 
graciously provided by the<b>KoZon Foundation</b>. AFIMA now organizes hand 
production of CooKits. Since the CooKits will be sold they must look as much as 
possible like CooKits produced in a factory. This can be challenging with hand 
production. In May 2003 I worked with five AFIMA members to develop a method to 
accomplish this. These instructions are posted (in French) on the KoZon Web 
site:www.kozon.org. Quality cardboard is not readily available in Mali and must 
be ordered from Senegal, adding to the price of the final product. Though KoZon 
provides AFIMA with aluminum foil and cooking bags, the pricier cardboard (and 
black cooking pot) drive the price up to nearly US $18, which urban people with 
jobs may be able to pay. In rural areas, however, the most people seem able and 
willing to pay is around US $4.75.</p> 
<p>Since 2001 AFIMA has continued to promote solar cooking throughout Mali. It 
developed a program to demonstrate the CooKit in the nine administrative 
regions of Mali. AFIMA received funding from the<b>Islamic Education and 
Science Organization</b> to demonstrate the CooKit in the Koulikoro region and 
the district of Bamako. The KoZon Foundation found two organizations in the 
Netherlands willing to finance demonstrations in the S&eacute;gou, Mopti and 
Kayes regions. Funds are still being sought for the Sikasso, Gao and Timbuktu 
regions.</p> 
<p>Last May I accompanied seven AFIMA members to two villages &#8213; Niamana 
and N'Tororo &#8213; in the Segou region. The 250-mile journey was taken by 
rented school bus, in which we endured temperatures over 40&ordm;C without air 
conditioning. Nobody complained. To pass the time we sang and clapped, or 
dozed. For both demonstrations women from 10 to 12 neighboring villages were 
also present. On arrival in the early morning our group first went to the 
village elders to be introduced and then moved to the place where the 
participants were waiting. In both villages about a 100 women attended, 
accompanied by many men and hundreds of children.</p> 
<p> Tororo workshop participants insert a food-filled pot into a CooKit </p> 
<p>AFIMA follows a fixed program during these demonstrations in which they 
include as many of the spectators as possible. First, ingredients are prepared 
and put in the pots. A group then takes about 30 CooKits to a sunny place 
nearby, unfolds them and learns to set them up, and finds stones to stabilize 
them in the wind. On and off women arrive with the filled pots, which are put 
in the transparent, heat resistant plastic bags and tied closed. Pots contain, 
rice, meat and chicken combined with vegetables; eggs to hard bake; and syrup 
preparations. While the sun is doing its work there is dancing and singing. 
After that, every body gathers around a microphone, some welcoming speeches are 
made, and a folded CooKit is put on a table and set up. We proceed to explain 
how the CooKit works and why the black pot is heated up by the energy of the 
sun. Two women out of the audience are then asked to repeat the explanations to 
show that they are well understood, which sometimes ends up in hilarious 
situations with lots of laughter. Then many questions are asked: Why do you 
blacken the pot? Can we find plastic cooking bags in our village? Why is 
aluminum foil used? How long will a CooKit last? Why don't you add water when 
cooking meat, vegetables and eggs?</p> 
<p>Next, practical tips on CooKit storage and maintenance are shared, followed 
by more singing and dancing until the food is cooked and ready to be shown and 
tasted. At the end, two CooKits are given to representatives from each village 
so the women can test them and further explore solar cooking.</p> 
<p>The women in these villages all cook over wood fires. We had a list of 
simple questions and, during the demonstrations, collected answers from 60 
women. Sixty-five percent said that they belong to large families and cook for 
10 to 30 persons. They prepare food three times daily starting at 5 am, 10 am 
and 4 pm. They collect their own wood, which takes three to four hours to find. 
Seventy-five percent of the women heat water to wash babies. As stated before 
the CooKit is not large enough to accept big cooking pots used to prepare 
millet broth and rice for large families. One CooKit is adequate for families 
of up to five persons, but two is better.</p> 
<p>In this area the best way to popularize the CooKit is to use it to produce 
warm water. (Heated-water can be kept warm in a heat-retention cooker.) As they 
become more comfortable with the CooKit&#146;s ability to heat water they will 
likely begin to utilize it more for cooking. Eggs and groundnuts are good 
starter foods.</p>

<p> Incentives offered to motivated Haitian solar cooks </p> 
<p>On December 18, 2003, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives <b>
Dennis Hastert</b> presented <b>Paul Munsen</b>, president of <b>Sun Ovens 
International</b>, with the US Commerce Department&#146;s Export Achievement 
Certificate. The award recognizes Sun Ovens International (SOI) for exports to 
Haiti that were made with the assistance of the Department of Commerce&#146;s 
Foreign Commercial Service. SOI has been involved in Haiti since 1997. It has 
partnered with a number of Rotary clubs and faith-based organizations, notably 
the<b>Free Methodist Inland Mission</b> in Port-au-Prince. Sun Ovens 
International recently launched a new solar cooking program in Haiti that will 
reward motivated solar cooks with subsidized Global Sun Ovens&reg; (GSOs) 
&#8213; a popular, high-quality solar cooker that has stood the test of time.
</p> 
<p>Through the Programme Energie Solaire (PES) &#8213; a project of the Free 
Methodists &#8213; over 5,000 Haitians have learned to solar cook. This 
three-day training program includes sessions on solar cooking principles and 
concepts as well as local environmental education. Participants build their own 
panel-type solar cooker (modeled after<b>Solar Cookers International</b>&#146;s 
CooKit) and solar cook lunch each day. These efforts culminate with a solar 
potluck on the final day. Most participants pay a fee to cover the costs of the 
workshop and materials.</p> 
<p>Sun Ovens International will employ the PES training model in its new 
project, in which 500 women will build their own solar panel cooker. Each woman 
will receive a log in which to document her solar cooker use and the amount of 
money saved by not buying cooking fuel (charcoal). Participants who use their 
solar panel cooker at least 70 percent of sunny days during a 90-day period 
will be eligible to buy a GSO at a subsidized rate.</p> 
<p> Creole chicken cooked to perfection in a GSO </p> 
<p>A similar, smaller project in 2000 provided GSOs at a subsidized cost of US 
$50 each. (GSOs retail in the US for $229.) Of the initial people trained, 65 
percent continued to use their solar panel cooker one year later on a regular 
basis. 92 percent of the people who obtained the GSOs continued using them 
regularly after the first 12 months.</p> 
<p>The GSOs will be assembled at a vocational school located at the <b>
Evangelical Baptist Church</b> in Lambert, Haiti. This process will provide 
students with vocational training and a source of income. The tooling and 
training required to assemble the ovens in Haiti is being provided. This will 
reduce the final cost by more than 50 percent. Leaders anticipate the project 
will expand with revenue from user fees, sales of GSOs to Haitian Americans for 
delivery to family members in Haiti, sales to other NGOs and solicitation of 
additional donors.</p>

<p> Peace Corps duo enthusiastic about Lesotho project </p> 
<p>U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers <b>Nancy Bailey</b> and <b>Mary Simonson</b> 
spent two years (2001-2003) in the Butha-Buthe district of northern Lesotho. A 
favorite project of theirs was solar cooking. &#147;The amazing thing about the 
solar oven project is the unprecedented level of community interest and 
investment,&#148; says Ms. Simonson. &#147;Previous workshops &#133; were 
historically poorly attended if there wasn&#146;t food offered or if 
participants were required to contribute money. The fact that people paid to 
attend these workshops where they built their own oven and only tea was served 
is a testament to their level of interest in this project.&#148; A summary of 
their reports follows.</p> 
<p>Lesotho is a high-altitude country with environmental degradation and 
cooking fuel shortages. Cow dung patties are the primary cooking fuel, 
supplemented with shrubs, dried aloe plants, and rootstalks of corn and other 
crops.</p> 
<p>Ms. Bailey and Ms. Simonson learned about solar cooking during their Peace 
Corps service. They received a CooKit (<b>Solar Cookers International</b>
&#146;s panel-style solar cooker) from a friend, as well as plans for various 
types of solar cookers from SCI&#146;s informational website the Solar Cooking 
Archive (http://solarcooking.org. They experimented with the CooKit and a 
homemade solar box cooker, testing many local foods and making modifications to 
optimize efficiency. Since Ms. Bailey lived at the popular<b>Liphofung Cultural 
Heritage Site,</b> many passers-by witnessed her cookers in action. Word spread 
and local residents began asking how they, too, could become solar cooks.</p> 
<p>Ms. Bailey taught her colleague, <b>Ntate Mohau</b>, general principles of 
solar cooker construction and use. She then translated construction guidelines 
and cooking tips into the local language, Sesotho. After locating needed 
materials, some of which came from neighboring South Africa, Ms. Bailey offered 
a &#147;build your own solar oven&#148; workshop to friends and neighbors. 
Participants paid half of the materials cost (roughly US $1.40) and brought 
their own aluminum pots to paint black. With Mr. Mohau&#146;s assistance, Ms. 
Bailey taught an initial 20 people how to build their own solar box cooker. Ms. 
Simonson began to lead workshops as well, concentrating on a panel-style solar 
cooker based on the CooKit because it was simpler to construct. Workshops 
generally had 10-12 participants lead by a teacher and two assistants. 
Workshops began with an explanation of basic solar cooking principles and 
cooking tips. Then participants would build their own solar cooker and paint 
their pots black.</p> 
<p> Recent solar cooking &#147;graduates&#148; and their hand-made solar box 
cookers at Liphofung</p> 
<p>During their last six months as Peace Corps Volunteers, Ms. Bailey and Ms. 
Simonson taught over 100 people how to make and use solar cookers. The project 
continues through the commitment of several Basotho solar enthusiasts and 
current Peace Corps Volunteers. Mr. Mohau continues to lead workshops in 
surrounding communities, and display and demonstrate several types of solar 
cookers at Liphofung. He recently led a workshop at a school for 
developmentally disabled children in Butha-Buthe. Now, the school has three 
solar cookers with which to cook the children&#146;s lunches and each of the 
teachers have a solar cooker that they use at home. Another workshop 
participant, Mr. Mpiti, was intrigued by the design possibilities and 
constructed several different solar cooker prototypes including an efficient 
concentrator-type solar cooker made from cardboard and foil. He has shown his 
designs at trade shows in Butha-Buthe and hopes to begin selling the cookers. 
Local shops in the area now carry large oven roasting bags (a necessary 
component of panel-style cookers and an inexpensive glazing option for solar 
box cookers) and have agreed to sell the bags individually to make them more 
affordable. A current Peace Corps Volunteer has taught her women&#146;s 
handicraft group how to solar cook and now the women use the ovens to cook 
their meals at work and at home. Now the women have more time to devote to 
their weaving, resulting in higher incomes for their families.</p>

<p> Sunstove founder passes away </p> 
<p><b>Richard &#147;Dick&#148; Wareham</b> passed away this past January at 
his home in Brookfield, Wisconsin (USA). He founded the<b>Sunstove Organization
</b> and spent much of his retirement years promoting solar cooking, 
particularly in South Africa.</p> 
<p>In an obituary, his colleague <b>Margaret Bennett</b> wrote: &#147;As a 
businessman with investments in [South Africa], Dick became aware of our 
environmental and social problems, especially those worsened by energy and

<p> Solar cookers and the HIV/AIDS pandemic </p> 
<p>By: <b>Pascale Dennery</b>, SCI Program Manager </p> 
<p>In addition to saving food, money and time, solar cookers offer significant 
health benefits via 1) reduced exposure to indoor air pollution from smoky 
cooking fires, 2) improved nutrition by eating slow-cooked foods, 3) fewer 
injuries associated with fuel wood collection and working around open fires, 
and 4) solar water pasteurization. These benefits are all the more life 
enhancing for families affected by HIV/AIDS.</p> 
<p>HIV/AIDS places an enormous economic and social burden on affected 
families. They have to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Obtain at least 25% more food for the ill family member whose nutritional 
requirements increase with time</li> 
<li>Constantly keep the patient clean to prevent infection of skin sores</li> 
<li>Have money for medicine to control diarrhea, pain, respiratory infections 
and other ailments</li> </ul> 
<p>Once an adult dies from the disease, the remaining adults and children 
struggle to survive day to day. The burden on elderly relatives and orphans 
increases as they need to get food and the fuel wood to cook it with, and raise 
money for many needs &#8213; such as soap, clothing, school fees, and 
maintenance of their own health. Solar cookers have the potential to benefit 
those that are ill and those who care for them. Solar cooks that are ill may 
experience some or all of the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fewer respiratory and water-related infections </li> 
<li>Relief from the physical burdens of gathering fuel wood </li> 
<li>Reduced transmission of HIV from mother to child through the use of solar 
pasteurization.</li> </ul> 
<p>Mothers who are HIV positive can solar pasteurize water for infant formula 
with freely available solar energy. Further, according to Bob Huff, formerly 
with the American Foundation for AIDS Research, some exciting research is being 
conducted on the possibility of pasteurized, expressed breast milk reducing (or 
eliminating) transmission of HIV from mother to child. Initial results are 
favorable.</p> 
<p>Adult caregivers who solar cook can devote more time for income generating 
activities and care of their ill family member(s), plus save the money they 
would have otherwise spent on cooking fuel to purchase additional food and 
other essentials. Children can attend school more regularly or take the time to 
study as they spend less time helping with collecting fuel wood or tending a 
cooking fire. In sunny communities where severe shortages of traditional fuels 
exist and where there is a prevalence of HIV/AIDS, solar cookers address many 
of the challenges faced by families in the midst of the AIDS pandemic.</p> 
<p> Architects, builders offered built-in solar cooker option </p> 
<p>The Solar Wall Oven (SWO) has been solar cooker pioneer <b>Barbara Kerr</b>
&#146;s pet project for nearly two decades. Since 1985, when she first built 
one into her house, she has tried to make this cooker available to the world. 
Now it is.</p> 
<p> Ms. Kerr&#146;s SWO as seen from inside her kitchen &#133; and outside her 
home</p> 
<p><b>The Kerr-Cole Sustainable Living Center</b> has developed do-it-yourself 
guidelines for architects, builders and remodelers to incorporate SWOs into 
their own designs. These guidelines allow for adaptability to a variety of 
circumstances and materials. They contain instructions on how to position and 
mount the oven to receive sufficient sunlight. The guidelines are freely

<p>First- and second-graders from <b>Edgerton School</b> in Kalispell, Montana 
(USA), earned a dime for each fact they learned during a unit about African 
cultures. They collected all the dimes in a bucket and donated them to<b>Solar 
Cookers International</b>. Their scholarly efforts brought in nearly $50. Way 
to go!</p>

<p>In the November 2003 Solar Cooker Review we erroneously stated that Manuel 
Collares Pereira lives in Spain. He actually lives Portugal. We regret the 
error.</p>
