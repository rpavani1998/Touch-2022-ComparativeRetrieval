<blockquote> 
<p>This big study costing millions of dollars was a slam against the low-fat 
diet, but read the above report with caution. Some of the statements made about 
Dr. Robert C. Atkins are blatant lies. The article states, &quot;Robert Atkins, 
keeled over weighing 258 lbs.&quot; These statements are lies. Dr. Robert C. 
Atkins was still caring for patients in his medical practice when he suffered a 
fatal head injury in an accidental fall on an icy sidewalk as he walked to work 
at age 72. He was healthy and trim at about 195 lbs. at the time of the 
accident. He never regained consciousness and suffered kidney failure before 
his death resulting in an excessive accumulation of body fluids. These lies are 
typical of those propagated by supporters of the low-fat diet dogma.</p>

<p><b>Study Shows the Low-Carb Diet Produces Better Cardiovascular Risk 
Factors Than the Low-Fat Diet<br>
</b>Annals of Internal Medicine, August 3, 
2010</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>&quot;Background:</strong> Previous studies comparing 
low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets have not included a comprehensive behavioral 
treatment, resulting in suboptimal weight loss.</p> 
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the effects of 2-year treatment 
with a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, each of which was combined with a 
comprehensive lifestyle modification program.</p> 
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Randomized parallel-group trial. 
(ClinicalTrials.gov registration number:NCT00143936)</p> 
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 3 academic medical centers.</p> 
<p><strong>Patients:</strong> 307 participants with a mean age of 45.5 years 
(SD, 9.7 years) and mean body mass index of 36.1 kg/m2 (SD, 3.5 kg/m2).</p> 
<p><strong>Intervention:</strong> A low-carbohydrate diet, which consisted of 
limited carbohydrate intake (20 g/d for 3 months) in the form of 
low&#150;glycemic index vegetables with unrestricted consumption of fat and 
protein. After 3 months, participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group 
increased their carbohydrate intake (5 g/d per wk) until a stable and desired 
weight was achieved. A low-fat diet consisted of limited energy intake (1200 to 
1800 kcal/d;&nbsp;&le;30% calories from fat). Both diets were combined with 
comprehensive behavioral treatment.</p> 
<p><strong>Measurements:</strong> Weight at 2 years was the primary outcome. 
Secondary measures included weight at 3, 6, and 12 months and serum lipid 
concentrations, blood pressure, urinary ketones, symptoms, bone mineral 
density, and body composition throughout the study.</p> 
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Weight loss was approximately 11 kg (11%) at 1 
year and 7 kg (7%) at 2 years. There were no differences in weight, body 
composition, or bone mineral density between the groups at any time point. 
During the first 6 months, the low-carbohydrate diet group had greater 
reductions in diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and 
very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lesser reductions in 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and more adverse symptoms than did 
the low-fat diet group. The low-carbohydrate diet group had greater increases 
in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at all time points, 
approximating a 23% increase at 2 years.</p> 
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Intensive behavioral treatment was provided, 
patients with dyslipidemia and diabetes were excluded, and attrition at 2 years 
was high.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Successful weight loss can be achieved with 
either a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet when coupled with behavioral 
treatment. A low-carbohydrate diet is associated with favorable changes in 
cardiovascular disease risk factors at 2 years.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>Food can be identified as having three major macronutrients -- proteins, 
fats and carbohydrates. Protein in the diet is broken down into the basic twenty
amino acids in the digestive tract and taken into the body. The amino acids are 
then recombined into thousands of different protein structures to make up our 
bodies. These structures are everything from the hair on our heads to thin 
clear membranes of the eye, muscles and lattice structure in bones. Vitamins 
and minerals are needed by the body as co-factors in the chemical process of 
combining the amino acids into proteins and for other functions. A deficiency 
of any vitamin, mineral, fatty acid, or amino acid will prevent the body from 
making the required protein or cell and will display the condition as a disease.

<p>Protein and cholesterol in the diet are needed by the body to create 
prostaglandins (hormonelike substances produced in mammalian tissues that are 
derived from amino acids), hormones (derived from cholesterol), and to provide 
many other functions. Amino acids from protein are the building blocks of life. 
Fats are essential for life. Fats are used by the body to form the outer shell 
of cells. Studies have shown high-fat diets will improve health without weight 
gain when carbohydrates are kept low. Vitamins and minerals are also used as 
co-factors in fat metabolism.</p>

<p>Fruit seems so natural and wholesome. How could it be anything but 
perfectly healthy? The problem arises in our ability to have fruit every day of 
the year, which is totally unnatural. Most fruit is all carbohydrate in the 
form of fructose or fruit sugar with no protein and no fat.<b>Fruit is little 
more than nature's candy.</b>Fructose causes insulin resistance. Some people 
think the body needs carbohydrates, but that is not the case. The body is made, 
healed, and maintained entirely by the protein and fat in the diet.<b>The daily 
requirement for carbohydrate is ZERO.</b> You will not die without 
carbohydrate. In fact, you will achieve optimum health without it. 
Scientifically, carbohydrates should not be classified as macronutrients 
because they are not essential for life or good health. You will die without 
protein and fats which are essential to build and maintain the body.<br>

<p>The body can maintain a perfectly normal level of blood glucose (a process 
called<i>gluconeogenesis</i>) by making it from either dietary protein or fats. 
The process is reversible and can go either way, allowing the body to maintain 
the proper blood glucose level without eating any carbohydrates.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;Both triglyceride molecules and protein molecules may be broken down 
and converted to glucose in the liver. The process by which new glucose is 
formed from noncarbohydrate sources is called gluconeogenesis. In the process 
of gluconeogenesis, glucose is formed from lactic acid, certain amino acids, 
and glycerol portion of triglyceride molecules (Fig. 25.10).&quot; Principles

<p><b>Carbohydrate-laden food is very unhealthy.</b> The body converts all 
carbohydrates to glucose or blood sugar. Table sugar is converted at a fast 
rate and grains at a slower rate. The level of blood glucose is very critical 
to the brain. Tests show the low-carbohydrate diet actually produces abetter 
glucose balance in the brain than a high-carbohydrate diet. The body can make 
any needed glucose from either protein or fat.</p> 
<p>Insulin (a body hormone) pushes excessive glucose into the cells to be used 
as fuel. The body does not need glucose for fuel because it can also use 
protein and fatty acids. After a few years the cells become resistant to this 
excess glucose and we become &quot;insulin resistant.&quot; The body must get 
rid of excess glucose by turning it into body fat. Actually, orange juice 
becomes fat in our arteries and turns into saturated fat on our tummy. The 
result is high levels of undesirable triglycerides, bad LDL cholesterol, and 
heart disease. After a period of accumulating fat, the body becomes resistant 
to depositing more fat. It then refuses to turn the glucose into fat and BOOM 
--- we become diabetic.<br>

Carbohydrates Suppress the Immune System by Barry Groves, Ph. D.<br>

Carbohydrates and Bread Are Linked to Teenage Acne.</p> 
<p>It is a scientific fact that fructose sugar in fruit causes insulin 
resistance that increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, high 
blood pressure, cancer, and diabetes. See the following truthful study that 
proves fructose as found in abundance in fruit and fruit juice is one of the 
root causes for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and Alzheimer's disease.</p> 
<p><b>Hypothesis: fructose-induced hyperuricemia as a causal mechanism for the 
epidemic of the metabolic syndrome.</b></p> 
<p>The liver produces cholesterol which is necessary in the transport and 
storage of body fat. Eating a low-cholesterol diet does not reduce blood 
cholesterol, since the liver just produces more. Eating carbohydrates produces 
bad LDL cholesterol that causes heart disease. Protein and fats reduce bad LDL 
and increase the good HDL cholesterol. Saturated fats are very healthy, and the 
omega-3 and some omega-6 fats are essential to good health. The best source for
omega-3 fat is from fish oils which have been proven to prevent heart disease. 
Yes, fats prevent heart disease. Omega-6 fats from vegetable oils should be 
avoided to keep the omega-6/omega-3 ratio in balance.<br>
Fish 'lowers dementia 
risk'.</p> 
<p>The three most nutritionally-important omega-3 fatty acids are 
alpha-linolenic fatty acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 
docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA). Alpha-linolenic fatty acid is one of two 
fatty acids traditionally classified as &quot;essential.&quot; The other fatty 
acid traditionally viewed as essential is an omega-6 fat called<i> linoleic acid
</i>. These fatty acids have traditionally been classified as 
&#147;essential&#148; because the body is unable to manufacture them on its own 
and because they play a fundamental role in several physiological functions. As 
a result, we must be sure our diet contains sufficient amounts of both 
alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. </p> 
<p>Partially-hydrogenated vegetable oils can contain 60% trans fats. These 
vegetable oils are chemically modified in the food factories under high 
temperature and pressure to force hydrogen atoms to attach to the oil 
molecules. Unnatural trans fats are created when one of the two hydrogen atoms 
at the double carbon bond (cis) moves to the opposite (trans) side. The result 
is a more solid fatty acid used in many foods as a substitute for the more 
expensive natural fats. Hydrogenated oils are not natural foods. They are 
factory-produced fatty acid chemicals. The resultant trans fatty acids enter 
the body and attach to cells where healthy fats are intended to be. Many 
doctors and researchers believe trans fats are one of the major factors causing 
adverse effects in immunity, reproduction, and lactation, as well as heart 
disease,diabetes, cancer, and obesity. The following page has a table listing 
dozens of common grocery store foods that contain the unhealthy trans fats.The 
Diet Cure.</p> 
<p>The bottom line in the prevention of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer is 
a diet low in carbohydrates and low in hydrogenated vegetable oils. The 
research carried out at Stockholm University in cooperation with experts at 
Sweden's National Food Administration, a government food safety agency, showed 
that heating carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes, rice, or cereals formed 
acrylamide, a much-studied substance classified as a probable human carcinogen.
Carbohydrates cause cancer. The healthy diet is high in protein and high in 
fats. Natural meat from any source is best, including beef, lamb, pork, wild 
game, poultry, fish, seafood, etc. Other good sources for protein and fats are 
eggs, cheeses, and real butter. Peanuts are a legume which contain a toxic oil 
and should be avoided. The diet must include essential omega-3 and arachidonic 
omega-6 fatty acids as found in animal products, but all other omega-6 fatty 
acids from vegetable sources such as vegetable oils, grains, nuts, and seeds, 
should be avoided.</p> 
<p><b>Myths, Distortions and Lies About BEEF<br>
Studies Prove Beef Is A Safe 
And Healthy Food</b></p> 
<p>Vegetables are an important part of this diet because they contain vitamin 
C, antioxidants, and many vita-nutrients. All vegetables are acceptable except 
the starchy ones such as potatoes, turnips, beets, and yams. About the only 
acceptable fruit are the berries such as strawberries, blueberries, 
boysenberries, etc. Soy products such as beans, oil, and protein are not to be 
included in this diet. Soy is not a healthy food.</p> 
<p>Soybean plants are the most genetically-modified organism (GMO) in the 
United States food supply. As of January, 2006, the percentage of soybeans that 
have been genetically modified is estimated to be 75% and spreading fast. 
Virtually all products on supermarket shelves that contain any soy or soy 
protein have all been contaminated. Just because a soy product is labeled 
&quot;organic&quot; does not mean it is GMO free. Vegetarians gorge themselves 
on soy products such as soy milk and soy burgers. Vegetarian foods such as 
breads, bagels, cereals, crackers, pastas, and energy drinks have all been 
fortified with soy protein made from GMO-contaminated soybeans.</p> 
<p>Vegetarians spread lies about beef. An example is the common claim that 
protein causes gout. Many people are brainwashed into believing these lies.

<p><b>Low-Fat, Low-Protein, and Low-Calorie Diets Cause Cancer</b></p> 
<p>Nathan Pritikin developed a low-fat, low-protein, and high-complex 
carbohydrate vegetarian diet in the 1970s due to his obesity and clogged 
arteries. His program required a very low-calorie diet and was strictly against 
the use of any vitamins, minerals, or other supplements. He claimed he reversed 
both of these conditions but died of suicide at the age of 60 years after 
battling leukemia (cancer of the bone marrow). Studies have now shown that his 
low-fat, low-protein diet causes cancer. He was warned by others that his diet 
had less vitamin E than minimum standards. It was also deficient in essential 
amino acids and essential fatty acids. His book was titled,<i>Permanent 
Weight-Loss Manual</i>, and indeed he had a permanent weight loss, 100%. 
Patients at his Centre for Longevity who followed the diet and didn't cheat 
also suffered a multitude of other medical problems.</p> 
<p>Nathan Pritikin's diet program did result in low cholesterol, but new 
studies have shown that a person with low cholesterol has an increased risk of 
committing suicide. Perhaps his low cholesterol as well as his leukemia 
contributed to his death by suicide.<br>

<p><b>Low-Fat, Low-Protein, and Low-Calorie Diets Cause Heart Disease</b></p> 
<p>James F. Fixx wrote two books on the health benefits of exercise and 
running, but he died in 1984 from a heart attack at the young age of 52 in his 
running shoes, while on a daily run. Many try to cover the facts by blaming it 
on his heredity or smoking which he quit nine years earlier, but Fixx developed 
severe coronary artery disease during his running years. He had developed 
atherosclerosis. One coronary artery wasalmost totally restricted, and another 
was 80% restricted. There was also evidence of a recent heart attack. In 
addition, his heart was somewhat enlarged, a condition doctors call<i> 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</i>. This condition occurs when the heart muscle 
become thick, making it more difficult for the heart to work. Exercise and low 
weight certainly helped him, but that could not overcome the disastrous effects 
of his diet. Fixx bought into the myth that fat in the diet is unhealthy, when 
in fact it is essential to life. He also became a vegetarian and refrained from 
eating meat. Fixx bought into the new philosophy that runners needed high 
levels of carbohydrates in their diets. He ate a very low-calorie diet to keep 
from gaining weight due to his excessive carbohydrate intake. He failed to take 
any vitamins, minerals or other supplements on the false premise that his 
vegetarian diet could provide them. He undoubtedly suffered from an amino acid 
deficiency compounded by an essential fatty acid deficiency and further 
compounded by a refusal to supplement with vitamins and minerals. Amino acids 
from protein are the building blocks of life, and it is difficult to obtain all 
of the amino acids required by one's diet without eating meat, fish, and fowl. 
The effects of these deficiencies take many years to manifest themselves, and 
the resultant disease can be just about anything in the book. This makes it 
extremely difficult to pinpoint the cause and effect of a low-fat, low-protein 
diet on one's health. People fail to understand that the minimum requirement 
for carbohydrates in the diet is zero - none.</p>

<p><b>Another Marathon Runner Proves Carbohydrates Kill</b> </p> 
<p> PowerBar founder  Brian Maxwell collapsed and died at 51 years of age on 
March 20, 2004, in San Anselmo, California.Brian Maxwell was a marathon runner, 
but he died of a heart attack at a very young age. His exercise, diet and 
energy bar did not provide the awesome health as commonly expected, but more 
than likely caused his early death. A former world-class marathon runner, 
Maxwell reportedly collapsed in a post office, and emergency personnel were 
unable to resuscitate him. The PowerBar company has become a 
multimillion-dollar empire since Maxwell and his wife, a nutritionist, founded 
it in 1986. They began selling the popular energy bars out of their kitchen and 
over the next 10 years the company grew to $150 million in sales. In March, 
2000, the couple sold the company to Nestle SA for a reported $375 million. 
Maxwell thought of the idea to make PowerBars while running a 26.2-mile 
marathon. He had to stop the race after 21 miles, the point at which experts 
say the body stops burning carbohydrates and starts to burn muscle tissue. In 
1977,<i> Track and Field News</i> ranked Maxwell the No. 3 runner in the world, 
and in 1980, he was part of the Olympic team that boycotted the games in 
Moscow. He represented Canada in many international competitions as a 
long-distance runner. </p> 
<p>Maxwell has proven once again that exercise does not prevent heart disease. 
He has also confirmed that the high-carbohydrate diet causes heart disease. His 
wife was a professional nutritionist and co-developer of the PowerBar, yet they 
created a &quot;health product&quot; that is pure garbage nutritionally. They 
both were strong promoters of conventional high-carbohydrate nutrition. She is 
rich, but he is dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a society, we are clearly in a state of nutritional crisis and in need 
of radical remedies. The statistics are sobering. After 30 years of seemingly 
solid advice aimed at lowering dietary fat, Americans have grown collectively 
fatter than ever. Today more than 60% of adults in the U.S. are classified as 
overweight or obese. Many children have become so heavy that pediatricians are 
now facing an epidemic of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension&#151;diseases that 
are closely associated with overweight and that were unheard of among 
youngsters just a generation ago.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>Low-Carb Initial Symptoms</b></p> 
<p>Going from a standard high-carb diet to the low-carb diet can initially 
cause several negative symptoms depending on other health problems. Typical 
temporary symptoms are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Slight headache. Simply ignore it.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Ketosis is not harmful at all, but it does cause a funny taste in the 
mouth. This will only last for a few weeks at most.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Slight constipation or sluggish bowel. This improves to normal in a few 
weeks. Digestion on low-carb is perfect with very little gas. Skipping days 
with no bowel movement is normal and expected.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Leg muscle weakness at the beginning of a hike. Simply keep going. The 
strength will return in a few minutes, and the legs will be stronger than ever 
as you continue on the hike.</p></li> </ul> 
<p>Carbohydrates are HIGHLY addictive. People don't believe this until they 
try not eating them. This is the main reason people give up low carb eating, 
especially those prone to addictive behaviors and weak self control. They make 
up all kinds of excuses for quitting low carb, but the truth is they couldn't 
overcome their addiction to carbohydrates. Addiction to high-sugar fruit is a 
serious problem among adults and children. A study of the shopping carts of 
adults and the eating habits of children easily proves this unhealthy addiction 
in all age groups is real. They would rather be sick and obese than give up the 
addiction.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>Meat, Fish &amp; Fowl. </b>Eat beef, lamb, pork, fish, seafood, fowl, 
and wild game of any kind. Do not cut off any of the fat --- eat it all. Do not 
skin chicken, duck, or other fowl and eat all of the skin. Eat cold water fish 
such as salmon which are high in omega-3 essential fatty acids. Eat some 
protein and fat at every meal.<br>

<li> 
<p><b>Fried Pork Rinds.</b> Fried pork skins are deep fried in their own fat 
and sold as fried pork rinds. They would be considered an awesome snack food 
except for the fact that the raw skins are heavily salted to prevent the growth 
of bacteria during shipping, handling, and storage prior to cooking. The 
unhealthy salt is heavily concentrated in the cooked rinds. Some of the salt 
can be removed by dunking or rinsing in hot water and eaten quickly before they 
get soggy, but a lot of unhealthy salt remains. Eat them in moderation and 
completely avoid them if you have high blood pressure.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Saturated Fat. </b>Eat fat including saturated fat. The North American 
Indians ate pemmican, a mixture of dried, crushed, and shredded meat mixed 
50/50 with the animal fat, yielding a food product that provided 70% of its 
calories from fat. Dried berries were sometimes added. This mixture would keep 
for many years.Eskimos lived all winter on nothing but caribou meat. They 
prepared a mixture using 80% fat and 20% caribou meat. Explorers Vilhjalmur 
Stefansson and Karsten Anderson found their health to be excellent.<i>Strong 
Medicine</i> by Dr. Blake F. Donaldson, MD., is a book about the Inuit-style 
meat-only Eskimo diet.</p> </li>

<p><b>Eggs. </b>Eggs are highly recommended as the perfect food.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Coconut Oil. </b>Fry in coconut oil or butter and use both generously in 
recipes.<br>

<li> 
<p><b>Vegetables. </b>Click on the name to see a picture. Eat well-done, 
boiled, or steamedasparagus, eggplant, green or yellow string beans, red 
tomatoes, spinach, celery, peppers, or green or yellow zucchini squash only. 
Red, gold, and yellow peppers may be better than the standard green peppers. 
These must be well cooked. They are good in a stir fry using refined coconut 
oil. Make a nice lunch or dinner by adding cubed precooked meat or leftover 
meat to stir-fried vegetables. Some cabbage is OK if well cooked. Try pressure 
cooking cabbage with green beans. Avoid the cabbage if it produces gas. Ripe 
avocados are acceptable with caution. Raw vegetables are not tolerated by the 
digestive system because of the fiber. Cooking reduces the fiber content. Do 
not drink raw vegetable juices. Canned 100% tomato juice is acceptable in 
moderation. Vegetables are of a minor importance, and those listed here should 
also be viewed with suspicion. Avoid any vegetable that gives an adverse 
reaction such as cramps, pains, or intestinal gas.<b>Avoid all seasonings. 
Avoid large servings of vegetables. This diet is primarily meat, fish, and fowl 
with the natural fats.</b></p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Avocados. </b>Eat avocados fresh or as a dip for vegetables. Avoid 
prepared dip with additives.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Cheese. </b>Hard cheeses are acceptable for those without a candida 
yeast infection. Eat only hard cheeses which list no more than 1g of 
carbohydrates on the nutritional label. Low-salt Swiss cheese is a very good 
choice that can be eaten without limit. Avoid eating high-sodium cheese with 
sodium content above 200mg per serving, especially for those with hypertension 
(high blood pressure).<i>Cheese Primer</i> by Steven Jenkins, is the best 
reference book for a good education about cheeses. Avoid low-fat, 
low-cholesterol cheese, but part-skim milk cheese is acceptable. Do not eat 
cream cheese, cottage cheese, soft cheese spreads,dry curd cottage cheese 
(DCCC), or Farmer's cheese. Some good cheeses are made from sheep's milk and 
goats' milk, but goats' milk cheese offers nothing special or better than cows' 
milk cheese.&nbsp; Blue-veined mold cheeses may promote candida more than other 
types and should be limited. Do not drink or cook with kefir milk, a fermented 
liquid product made with active yeasts and bacteria from grains and goat or 
sheep milk. Do not eat kefir yogurt.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Omega-3 Fatty Acids. </b>Supplement with omega-3 essential fatty acids 
by taking Carlson's Lemon Flavored Cod Liver Oil. Start with one tablespoon 
twice a day. Avoid flaxseed oil because it contains more inflammatory omega-6 
fatty acids than essential omega-3 fatty acids. Flax is a poor source of 
omega-3 fatty acids. The body must convert the shorter ALA fatty acid found in 
flaxseed oil into EPA and DHA fatty acids before you will receive major 
benefits, something most of us don't do well. The following links are to 
studies which should be read.<br>

<li> 
<p><b>Borage Oil. </b>Supplement with omega-6 gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) by 
taking one borage oil capsule per day. The body cannot produce essential fatty 
acids - you must get them from the food you eat. Your body uses GLA and omega-3 
fatty acids to make E1 series prostaglandins that help reduce inflammation, aid 
digestion, and help regulate your metabolism. Avoid all other omega-6 vegetable 
oils as found in nuts, seeds, and grains.<br>
Benefits of Borage Oil.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Vitamins and Minerals. </b>Supplement with a complete vitamin, mineral, 
enzyme, probiotic, and amino acid program shown in the link below. Avoid extra 
vitamin D supplementation. The cod liver oil has about 500 IU of vitamin D per 
teaspoon. Don't be concerned about vitamin D toxicity as incorrectly 
claimed&nbsp; &quot;Even without careful attention to the type of vitamin D 
being used, a recent expert review on vitamin D was unable to find any 
published evidence of vitamin D toxicity in adults from an intake of 10,000 IU 
per day that was verified by the blood 25(OH)D concentration.&quot;<br>
My 
personal vitamin, mineral, and supplement program by Kent R. Rieske.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Reverse Osmosis Water. </b>Install a reverse osmosis with UV lamp water 
system with ultraviolet (UV) lamp for all drinking and cooking. The UV lamp 
kills all viruses and bacteria. Avoid domestic water, which contains chlorine 
and fluorine. Avoid mineral, natural, or spring water sold in stores, as many 
contain undesirable minerals and contaminants. Some have been pulled from the 
shelves because of these contaminants.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Coffee, Tea &amp; Soft Drinks. </b>Weak regular coffee and black tea are 
acceptable. Several cups of regular black coffee a day are perfectly acceptable 
to most people. Don't drink decaf coffee or decaf black tea due to the toxic 
chemicals used to remove the caffeine. Peppermint tea is preferred. A small 
amount of lemon or lime juice squeezed from a small wedge of fresh lemon or 
lime can be added to water or tea. Ginger root tea is great. Cut a piece about 
the size of the small fingertip from fresh ginger root. Remove the skin. Chop 
and squeeze with a garlic press. Put the juice and pulp in a cup, French press, 
or tea ball and add boiling water for two minutes. Strain out the pulp. Ginger 
has a spicy flavor and is very soothing to the tummy and digestive tract. Diet 
sodas containing aspartame and/or Splenda and regular sodas are absolutely 
forbidden. Do not drink apple cider vinegar, because the health claims are 
unfounded. The malic and acetic acids in apple cider vinegar can burn the 
throat and promote bacterial vaginosis.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Beware of Bacteria Contaminated Coffee.</b> Many coffee shops and 
restaurants use a fresh-brewed coffee dispenser that contaminates the coffee 
with pathogenic bacteria. These bad bacteria upset healthy digestion without 
the consumer discovering the source of their food poisoning. The worst type of 
dispenser can be recognized as an insulated tank with a pump on the top. The 
internal parts of the pump are rubber or plastic diaphragms and tubes that 
cannot be cleaned. Most coffee shops and restaurants make no attempt to clean 
the pump mechanism. Rubber and plastic parts easily harbor bad bacteria that 
continue to multiply. The coffee in the pump also cools easily. The temperature 
of the hot coffee is not high enough to sterilize the parts. The best coffee 
dispenser is the type with a spherical clear glass pot that is very easy to 
clean and inspect. The coffee filter mechanism should be a stainless steel cone 
that is also easy to clean. Ask your coffee shop or restaurant about their 
coffee brewing and dispensing system. Inspect the clear glass serving pots for 
cleanliness. Don't drink coffee that is brewed and dispensed from a poorly 
designed system.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Coconut. </b>Eat and cook with refined or virgin coconut oil, and eat 
unsweetened, shredded coconut. Try both together at the same time for a taste 
treat. Do not eat processed coconut flour because it is the concentrated bad 
portion of coconut consisting of fiber and carbohydrates.<br>

<li> 
<p><b>Nuts and Seeds.</b> Avoid most nuts and seeds because they contain high 
levels of omega-6 fatty acids described below. Hazelnuts (filberts), macadamia 
nuts, and pine nuts (pinion, pinon, pinyon or pignolia) are great snacks with 
the lowest amount of omega-6 fats. Limit quantities to test for a reaction. All 
other nuts and seeds are forbidden. All species of nuts are not healthy as many 
claim.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Probiotics.</b> A healthy balance of beneficial bacteria (called <b>
probiotics</b>) must be restored in the intestines during the low-carbohydrate, 
anti-yeast diet. The most common approach is to supplement the diet with a 
probiotic containing live lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, 
and bifidobacterium bifidum as the better choices. Lactobacillus bulgaricus is 
intended to help the GI tract be more suitable for the survival and growth of 
lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. Acidophilus is the 
primary bacteria of the small intestine while bifidum is the major bacteria of 
the large intestine. Other beneficial bacteria include bifidobacterium lactis, 
bifidobacterium longum, and many more. New evidence points to lactobacillus 
sporogenes as being particularly effective against intestinal and vaginal 
infections and should also be taken. Most should be refrigerated. Capsules and 
liquids are available, but care should be taken in the selection because many 
brands contain dead spores. Quality products are usually kept in a cooler at 
the health food or vitamin store. Expect some or all products to contain rice 
flour, potato starch, maltodextrin, and other fillers which are needed to keep 
the bacteria alive. Take only one tablet or one teaspoon with each meal or with 
water. Do not take high quantities as may be recommended on some bottles.<b>
Sporogenes is highly recommended for everyone, even healthy individuals. It 
does not require refrigeration. Multidophilus by Solaray should also be taken. 
Multidophilus must be refrigerated and purchased only from a refrigerated 
display at a local vitamin store.</b><br>

<p><b>Carbohydrate Addiction.</b> Carbohydrates are highly addictive, and many 
people have lived their entire life with an insulin rush from excessive glucose 
intake. Insulin is the body's most powerful hormone and makes resisting 
carbohydrates extremely difficult. Many would rather be sick than give up their 
fruit with the high levels of fructose, the second most addictive carbohydrate. 
To be healthy one must break these addictions.</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Protein and L-Glutamine Drink.</b><b> </b>Prepare a drink made with whey 
amino acid protein powder which is enriched with extra glutamine amino acid. 
The protein powder consists of a full compliment of amino acid isolates that 
heal the body and require no digestion. Prepare the drink by blending 8 to 16 
oz ofreverse osmosis with UV lamp water or unsweetened, low-sodium tomato juice 
with 1 heaping teaspoon (12 gm) of whey protein powder plus 1 rounded teaspoon 
(8 gm) of glutamine amino acid powder. Stirring vigorously with the teaspoon is 
sufficient. The whey protein must be specified on the carton as isolates from 
cross flow microfiltration and ion-exchange, ultrafiltered concentrate, low 
molecular weight, and partially hydrolyzed whey protein peptides rich in 
branched chain amino acids and glutamine peptides. The low-carbohydrate type at 
1 gm per scoop or less is best, but it should not be more than 4-5 gm of 
carbohydrates per scoop. Do not substitute protein from soy, egg, casein, or 
any other source. Sugar or any other sweetener is unacceptable. Use the 
&quot;natural flavor&quot; without additives. This amino acid drink can be 
enjoyed anytime with or without a meal. Amino acids are foods that build and 
maintain the body.<b>Refrigerate whey protein powder and discard if it is old. 
Whey protein powder can cause some gas and an unusually &quot;full&quot; 
feeling. Discontinue the whey protein powder if the reactions are unpleasant. 
Continue to take the glutamine powder.</b><br>

<p>The three most nutritionally-important omega-3 fatty acids are 
alpha-linolenic fatty acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 
docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA). Alpha-linolenic fatty acid is one of two 
fatty acids traditionally classified as &quot;essential.&quot; The other fatty 
acid traditionally viewed as essential is an omega-6 fat called linoleic acid. 
These fatty acids have traditionally been classified as &#147;essential&#148; 
because the body is unable to manufacture them on its own and because they play 
a fundamental role in several physiological functions. As a result, we must be 
sure our diet contains sufficient amounts of both alpha-linolenic acid and 
linoleic acid.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote>

<p><b>Foods That Are Absolutely Forbidden</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Detox Diet Plans.</b> Never participate in any of the popular detox diet 
programs. All of these programs recommend many foods that are very harmful to 
people with food-caused autoimmune diseases. These plans typically forbid 
eating the healthy foods listed here. Detox diet plans are always low-fat which 
means they are high in harmful carbohydrates. The &quot;detox&quot; concept is 
a fraud and a scam. The body does not build up toxin except in cases of rare 
trace metals such as mercury or lead. The detox diet programs will not remove 
poisonous metals from the body. A standard scientific laboratory should be used 
to test for mercury or lead poisoning. Most alternative medicine tests for 
toxins and food allergies are a scam as well. Detox diet plans also run the 
risk of causing leaky gut syndrome, the major cause of autoimmune diseases.
Leaky Gut Syndrome.</p> </li>

<p><b>Sugar and Sweets.</b> Do not eat sugar in any form. Sugar raises the 
level of free-radicals and blood insulin which causes heart disease anddiabetes
. Do not eat corn syrup, fructose, honey, sucrose, maltodextrin, dextrose, 
molasses, rice milk, soy milk, grape juice, fruit juice, brown rice syrup, 
maple syrup, date sugar, cane sugar, corn sugar, beet sugar, succanat or 
lactose. Do not eat candy, cookies, ice cream, cakes, dates, crackers, soft 
drinks or yogurt which are all high in carbohydrates. Diabetes, heart disease 
and cancer could best be described as CARBOHYDRATE ADDICTS SYNDROME.<br>

Ways Sugar Can Ruin Your Health.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Honey.</b> Do not eat honey. Honey is pure carbohydrate sugar consisting 
of fructose and glucose, sucrose, maltose, isomaltose, maltulose, turanose, 
kojibiose, erlose, theanderose and panose. It is very confusing why people 
worship honey. Many people are wrong on this point. They claim it is acceptable 
because ancient cavemen may have eaten it and somehow became adapted to honey 
as a healthy food. That is an incorrect conclusion. Ancient Paleo man may have 
eaten it once in a lifetime, but probably not. They didn't want to be stung by 
bees any more than we do, and they didn't have any protective netting.<br>

Chemistry of Bees.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Sugar Alcohols.</b> Many of the &quot;sugar free&quot; sweeteners are 
classified as a sugar alcohol. Sugar alcohols affect the blood glucose levels 
less dramatically than regular table sugar, but they quickly add up to too many 
carbohydrates. They contain a little more than one half the amount of 
carbohydrates as an equal amount of table sugar. Common sugar alcohols are 
mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, maltitol syrup, galactitol, erythritol, 
inositol, ribitol, dithioerythritol, dithiothreitol, and glycerol, as well as 
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates that are found naturally in fruit. These sugar 
alcohols generally have unpleasant side effects such as abdominal discomfort 
and bloating. They also have a laxative effect.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Processed Meats.</b> Do not eat processed meats such as sausage, hot 
dogs, ham, deli meats, injected turkey and injected chicken due to the added 
chemicals and sugar and salt content.<br>

not Red Meat.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Starchy Vegetables, Lettuce and Spinach.</b> Limit carbohydrates in all 
forms except low-starch vegetables. Avoid those starchy vegetables that grow 
below the ground such as potatoes, yams, turnips, beets, radishes and carrots. 
Avoid pumpkin and winter squash. Never eat lettuce and raw spinach because of 
the risk of pathogenic bacteria contamination. Cooked spinach is OK. Salad bars 
are a high risk for food poisoning.<br>

<li> 
<p><b>Fiber.</b> Do not take fiber supplements. Do not take psyllium seed husk 
which is very abrasive to the digestive system. Do not take 
fructooligosaccharides (FOS) fiber supplement because it consists of long 
chains of fructose units. Do not eat wheat bran or rice bran. Fiber is a bad 
dude. Dietary fiber may not be digestible by the healthy individual, but it 
certainly is digestible by pathogenic gut bacteria and yeasts.<b>Fiber is the 
perfect time-release food for bad gut bugs and one of the worst things a person 
can eat for good health, contrary to professional medical advice.</b> These 
bacteria and yeasts ferment the fiber to produce alcohol, acetaldehyde, lactic 
acid, acetic acid, and a host of other toxic chemicals when they break down the 
fiber. Intestinal gas (flatulence) is a sure sign that fiber and/or sugars are 
being fermented. The vegetarian concept of turning the gut into a fermentation 
tube is ridiculous. Avoid all whole grains, brown rice, fruit, and dried beans, 
as they are high in both fiber and complex carbohydrates, a double blow to the 
digestive system. The reason many gastroenterologists recommend a high-fiber 
diet is based on the faulty logic of Dr. Dennis Burkitt, a British surgeon 
working in Africa more than half a century ago. Dr. Burkitt's theory that 
barley bread prevented irritable bowel disorders has failed. The Africans were 
simply showing the benefits of not eating fruit and refined carbohydrates like 
sugar and flour. Fiber not only does not prevent or cure irritable bowel 
diseases but actually makes them worse. Studies of many other primitive 
societies have proven very low-fiber diets prevent intestinal diseases and 
cancer as proven by Weston A. Price, DDS in his book<i>Nutrition and Physical 
Degeneration</i> and arctic explorers Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Karsten 
Anderson during many years of living with the Eskimos.<br>

<li> 
<p><b>Fruit and Fruit Juices.</b> Do not eat any fruit of any kind because of 
the sugar, and do not drink fruit juices. Fructose ( fruit sugar) has been 
linked to insulin resistance, the primary cause of diabetes. Fruit promotes the 
growth of pathogenic intestinal bacteria, candida yeast and fungi. Do not drink 
apple cider vinegar, because the health claims are unfounded. The malic and 
acetic acids in apple cider vinegar can burn the throat and promotes bacterial 
vaginosis (bacteria overgrowth a woman's vagina).</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Margarine and Trans Fats.</b> Do not eat margarine, commercial 
mayonnaise or any product that contains hydrogenated oils (trans fats).<br>
US 
Panel Says No Amount of Trans Fat Is Safe.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Omega-6 Fatty Acids.</b> Strictly avoid omega-6 polyunsaturated 
vegetable, seed or grain oils made from corn, soybean, canola, safflower, 
sunflower, cottonseed, almond, apricot, grapeseed, peanut, poppyseed, rice 
bran, sesame, teaseed, tomato seed, walnut, and wheat germ. Do not take any 
omega-6 oils such as flaxseed or primrose oil. The omega-6 oils cancel the 
benefits of the good omega-3 fat. One beneficial omega-6 fatty acid is 
gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) that can be obtained by supplementation with borage 
oil. Solid scientific research shows omega-6 fatty acids are highly 
inflammatory and should never be eaten by anyone with bowel disease, heart 
disease, arthritis or any other autoimmune disease. Healthy people should 
seriously limit these omega-6 fatty acids. Dr. Robert C. Atkins' in his book, 
&quot;Age-Defying Diet Revolution&quot; and Dr. Michael Eades in his book, 
&quot;Protein Power Lifeplan&quot; both have long sections describing the 
unhealthy effect of these oils.<br>

</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Milk.</b> Do not drink cow's milk. Lactose in cow's milk is one of the 
most allergenic foods, and the symptoms are commonly described as lactose 
intolerance. Milk does not prevent osteoporosis. Do not drink goat's milk, rice 
milk, soy milk, lactaid milk, acidophilus milk, almond milk or nut milks of any 
kind.Do not drink or cook with kefir milk, a fermented liquid product made with 
active yeasts and bacteria from grains and goat or sheep milk. Do not eat kefir

<p><b>Heavy Whipping Cream.</b> Do not use cream or heavy whipping cream, 
because it has an unacceptable level of lactose called buttermilk after 
separation from the fats. Commercial heavy whipping cream also has thickening 
additives such as carrageenan, which may be associated with the promotion of 
malignancy and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and may cause cancer.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Pre-Whipped Cream and Toppings.</b> Do not eat pre-whipped cream or 
low-fat, non-dairy whipped cream because they contain sugar and/or trans fats. 
See the list of typicalstore foods containing heart-clogging trans fats.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Yogurt.</b> The acidophilus in yogurt is simply killed by stomach acid 
and does not provide the desirable probiotics for the intestinal tract. The 
lactose in yogurt feeds candida yeast and pathogenic bacteria. All yogurt is 
BAD food. Goat's milk yogurt is also BAD food.</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>Soy Products.</b> Do not eat any soy products. Fermented foods are not 
acceptable for those with yeast overgrowth infections. Do not use soy protein 
powders, but whey protein powders are acceptable. Soy protein is missing 
several of the amino acids, one of which is classified as an essential. Do not 
eat soy protein chips or cereals. Tofu made from soybeans has been shown to 
shrink the brain and cause cognitive impairment (brain fog).<br>

<p><b>Wheat, Corn and Other Grains.</b> Do not eat any wheat products or other 
grains such as corn, oats, rye, rice, barley, millet, kamut, or spelt. Corn is 
missing three of the essential amino acids necessary for good health. Grains 
are a poor source of protein. Do not eat any breads or other flour products. 
Grains are the most allergenic of all foods. Multiple sclerosis, lupus, and 
rheumatoid arthritis are rare in populations where no grain products are 
consumed. The Paleolithic (hunter-gatherer) diet is an example.<br>

waffles, bread, biscuits, tortillas, taco shells, bagels, pasta, noodles, corn 
chips, pop corn, croutons, spreads, dressings, desserts, soups, soy snacks, 
rice snacks, candy, cakes, or pastries, because they usually contain partially

colorings, and preservatives, and they are all very high in carbohydrates.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Potatoes and Yams.</b> Do not eat any potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, 
French fries or potato chips. French fries are not only very high in unhealthy 
carbohydrates, but they're generally cooked in hydrogenated soybean oil or 
other rancid vegetable oils that are known to generate cancer-causing chemicals 
at high temperatures and are high in inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids. Always 
fry in coconut oil or butter.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Bananas and Citrus.</b> Do not eat bananas, oranges, or grapefruits as 
they are very high in carbohydrates.</p> </li>

<p><b>Legumes.</b> Do not eat beans and legumes because of their high 
carbohydrate levels. Limit peanuts as they are a legume and contain a very 
unhealthy fat.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Bad Cheeses.</b> Do not eat soft, dark orange cheeses such as Cheez Whiz 
that are made from partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats). Avoid processed 
cheese food such as Velveeta and American cheese that contain corn oil instead 
of butterfat. Do not eat cream cheese or cottage cheese since they contain 
lactose and other sugars. Contrary to popular belief, cottage cheese has been 
proven to be a cause of bone loss and osteoporosis.<br>

processed meats and heavy whipping cream. Carrageenan may be associated with 
the promotion of malignancy and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and 
may cause cancer.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Fast Food Restaurants.</b> Avoid fast food hamburgers, because many are 
&quot;bulked-up&quot; with 25% soy protein and/or cooked in trans fats or 
polyunsaturated fats. Burgers that are labeled as 100% beef and cooked by 
grilling are the best. Avoid French fries as well, because the frying oils are 
either trans fats, polyunsaturated fats or fat which has become rancid from 
overuse. Grilled chicken breast is an acceptable choice. Don't eat the bun. 
Don't eat anything coated or any deep fried foods.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Restaurant Buffalo Chicken Wings.</b> Restaurants ruin most of the good 
foods they touch. Chicken wings are a good example of an awesome food that is 
destroyed by the unhealthy cooking methods of deep frying in trans fats or 
unhealthy omega-6 polyunsaturated fats such as soybean, corn, safflower or 
peanut oil. These fats easily become rancid, which makes them even more 
unhealthy. Baked chicken, fish and red meat are OK if they are not heavily 
salted or treated with tenderizers such as MSG. You can ask the restaurant, but 
they may lie.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Safety of Plastics.</b> Avoid those plastics for use as food containers 
that have been shown to release harmful chemicals into the food or water that 
is stored in the containers. The containers should have a triangle mark on the 
bottom with a number. Numbers 1,2, 4 and 5 are least harmful. Avoid all others. 
Glass, ceramic, stainless steel and cast iron are more acceptable containers 
for food.<br>

</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Microwave Ovens.</b> Avoid the use of microwave ovens except for heating 
plain water. Microwave energy destroys enzymes and vitamins. It also breaks 
weak molecules into undesirable elements. The energy can cause the unhealthy 
cross linking between molecules. Microwaving starches such as potatoes and 
other carbohydrates such as bread creates high levels of acrylamide, a chemical 
proven to cause cancer in laboratory animal tests.<br>

<p><b>Soap, Shampoo, Body Cream, Powder and Oils.</b> Use facial make-up, body 
creams, lotions, oils and body powder sparingly. Do not use those containing 
wheat protein, sugars, fruit juices or omega-6 fatty acids as found in 
vegetable, nut and seed oils. Coconut oil, cocoa butter, palm oil, olive oil, 
fish oils and natural animal fats are acceptable but are still prone to being 
rancid. The term &quot;natural&quot; does not necessarily indicate that the 
product is acceptable. Products with natural soybean oil, safflower oil and 
other seed oils are absolutely dreadful oils because they are highly 
inflammatory. Use make-up sparingly. The following are some acceptable products.

<p><b>Improving Good Cholesterol on the Low-Carbohydrate Diet</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Many question the cancer risk from eating lots of red meat and saturated 
fats, and we are constantly being warned to avoid the &quot;artery- clogging 
saturated fat.&quot; These scare tactics are not confirmed in the study of 
ancient cultures and more recent studies. It just isn't so. The body grows, 
heals, and functions by utilizing the proteins (amino acids) and fats (fatty 
acids) in the diet. Both are essential for life, and deficiencies lead to a 
myriad of diseases which appear to have no cause. The trend away from the 
consumption of protein and fat is making all who listen statistics in 
record-setting illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The current 
medical community has begun to blame everything on genetics and wring their 
hands because &quot;the message just isn't getting through.&quot; 
Unfortunately, the low-fat, no-red meat message is getting through. People are 
eating the USDA Food Guide Pyramid diet, and their bodies are struggling to rid 
themselves of the excess glucose from carbohydrates, while fighting desperately 
with shortages of essential amino acids and fatty acids.Vegetarians develop 
high cholesterol and can't correct it. They blame it on heredity because they 
don't understand body chemistry. Don't believe the advice given on Dr. Andrew 
Weil's web site above because bad cholesterol readings are caused by 
high-carbohydrate diets and not by animal products. Dr. Weil's diet 
recommendations should never be followed because they closely parallel the 
unhealthy USDA Food Guide Pyramid and also discourage eating healthy meat and 
natural animal fats. Get the truth at the website below from ex-vegetarians who 
returned to eating meat and animal fat in order to recover from their health 
problems caused by their failed vegetarian diet.</p> 
<p> <b>Beyond Vegetarianism - Raw Food, Vegan, Fruitarian, and Paleo Diets.</b>
</p> 
<p>The major responsibility for our diet recommendation rests on the shoulders 
of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States 
Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). The USDA has published the official diet 
in the form of an icon called theUSDA Food Guide Pyramid. The USFDA has 
published the officialUSFDA Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat. However, therein lies a big flaw. Neither the Food Guide 
Pyramid nor the RDA is based on scientific facts. If you follow the Food Guide 
Pyramid as your daily nutritional guide, you will encounter many related 
degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, bowel disease, 
autoimmune diseases, and many more. The USDA Food Guide Pyramid and FDA 
Recommended Daily Allowances are solely responsible for the current high 
incidence of adult onset Type II diabetes, which has tripled in the last 30 
years. Type II diabetes is becoming common among teenagers, who were once 
thought to be excluded from this &quot;age-related&quot; disease.</p> 
<p> <b>USDA - Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2000.</b></p> 
<p>The bad press about ketones in the blood on a low-carbohydrate diet are <b>
lies</b> and <b>distortions</b>. According to Dr. Atkins, &quot;Ketosis is 
really a shortening of the term lipolysis/ketosis. Lipolysis simply means that 
you're burning your fat stores and using them as the source of fuel they were 
meant to be. The by-products of burning fat are ketones, so ketosis is a 
secondary process of lipolysis. When your body releases ketones in your urine, 
it is chemical proof that you&#146;re consuming your own stored fat. And the 
more ketones you release, the more fat you have dissolved.&quot; Tests have 
proven that normal ketosis is healthy and is not ketoacidosis as experienced by 
diabetics.</p> 
<p><b>Ketosis Myths and Facts on the Low-Carbohydrate Diet.</b></p> 
<p>The graph below shows my reversal of high-cholesterol measurements as a 
result of the low-carbohydrate diet described above. The total cholesterol 
remained steady at about 206, which is considered good in a desirable range of 
180 to 200. The best result was the huge drop in the bad Triglycerides (TG) 
from 214 to 120 to 92 and the very good rise in the good HDL cholesterol from 
35 to 51 to 55. HDL is very difficult to raise on any other diet.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The heart disease risk is measured by the ratio TG/HDL. My ratio was bad at 
6.1 for ten years preceding the start of the Atkins' diet in June, 1999. The 
ratio dropped to a respectable 2.4 during the first four months and is 
presently at a very good ratio of 1.7. The most desirable ratio is 1.0 or less, 
but are cholesterol readings really all that important? Some facts suggest 
otherwise</p>

<p><b>Cholesterol Risk Factors Commonly Used</b></p> 
<p>Total Cholesterol, CT = HDL + LDL + VLDL<br>
 VLDL = Triglycerides (TG) / 5
<br>  LDL = CT - HDL - VLDL<br>
Total cholesterol, CT, is best between 180 and 
200.<br>
 Increase the 200 number limit when HDL is above 50.<br>
 Example: 
When HDL = 60 the best cholesterol range is 180 to 210.<br>
 CT / HDL &gt; 3.0 
and &lt; 5.0 Above 5.0 increase coronary risk factor.<br>
 HDL &gt; 40 for men. 
Less than 40 increases coronary risk and above 60 gives protection.<br>
 HDL 
&gt; 50 for women. Less then 50 increases coronary risk and above 60 gives 
protection.<br>
 LDL &lt; 160 Above increases risk.<br>
 TG &lt; 150 Above 
increases risk.<br>
 LDL / HDL &lt; 3.0 Above 3.0 increases coronary risk 
factor. Readings near 1.0 or less is best.<br>
TG / HDL &lt; 3.0 Above 3.0 
increases coronary risk factor. Readings near 1.0 or less is best.</p>

<p>The daily nutrition program which eliminates or reduces health problems has 
been proven to be a high-fat, high-protein and low-carbohydrate diet. Blood 
pressure on the diet will drop so significantly that those on blood pressure 
medication should monitor their pressure carefully and be prepared to reduce 
the dosage. Naturally, those with special health problems should find a doctor 
who understands this diet and adjusts medication accordingly.</p> 
<p>Many claims and criticisms are being fired from every direction among the 
opponents in the current &quot;diet wars.&quot; You can resolve the issue by 
testing the low-carbohydrate diet yourself. I have been on the Atkins' 
low-carbohydrate diet since June, 1999, and lost 35 pounds in the first four 
months. I am currently down 50 pounds to the &quot;ideal&quot; weight range. 
The Atkins' diet is better described as a high-protein, high-fat diet because 
Dr. Atkins encourages the consumption of fats, even saturated fats. I have 
eaten lots of red meat with high fat content during the past three years. Cuts 
were specifically selected which had the most fat, such as 27% fat ground beef, 
ribs, rib-eye steaks, lamb, pork roasts, and chicken with the skin. Salmon is 
especially good because it contains a high level of essential omega-3 fatty 
acid. My favorite cooking method is on the gas grill with low heat. The low 
heat does not melt all the fat, and prevents damage to the fat caused by high 
heat and oxidation. Vegetables are not essential in the diet because most 
vegetables do not contain fats or protein, but they do make one feel 
psychologically normal when eaten in a group setting. Avoid high-carbohydrate, 
starchy vegetables like potatoes, yams, winter squash, and turnips. Coconut oil 
is the most preferred for frying and stir-fry. Real butter is the second best 
choice. Eat and cook with refined or virgin coconut oil, and eat unsweetened, 
shredded coconut. Try both together at the same time for a taste treat.<br>

<p>Most people do not believe diet can cure their illnesses, and they resort 
to prescription drugs. They do this because they &quot;already eat a balanced 
diet,&quot; yet remain sick. In truth, their diet is what made them sick and 
continues to prevent their healing. The acceptable foods above in combination 
with vitamins and minerals can heal the body, where as prescription drugs only 
cover and mask the undesirable symptoms.</p> 
<p>Those who have been on the above diet for several months are overjoyed at 
their sudden health improvements. They are also shocked at the harsh negative 
reactions in their body to eating sugar and carbohydrate, which can cause the 
heart pulse rate to jump and blood pressure to rise suddenly. However, once you 
feel the awesome health benefits from eating low carbohydrate, you will never 
go back.<br>

<p>The following quote and table are from Adipos 101. &quot;We need large 
scale randomized studies comparing low fat and low carbohydrate diets. Until 
such studies is published, we must compare results reported by Ornish and 
Atkins themselves. The Ornish figures are the average of the Ornish 
Experimental group (n=22) carefully selected from hundreds of applicants. The 
Atkins' data (n=1) is from page 150 of his 1992 book. Neither of these samples 
is necessarily representative of the overweight population. However, the 
starting age, weight, and body mass index of Atkins' sample resembles those of 
Ornish's experimental group much more closely than Ornish's own control group, 
lending credence to the comparison.&quot;<b></b></p> </blockquote> <b>Ornish

<p>&quot;Further confirmation of Atkins' data comes from Dr. Ronald Krauss, 
chairman of the American Heart Association's Nutrition Committee. In some men 
with normal-sized LDL cholesterol particles, a very low-fat diet can cause 
changes in the cholesterol profile that indicate an increased heart disease 
risk. In one study, 36 out of 87 men with normal-sized LDL particles switched 
to the small-particle abnormalities when their dietary fat was lowered from 46 
percent of calories from fat to 24 percent. One sign of the switch was a rise 
in their ratio of total cholesterol to &quot;good&quot; HDL cholesterol, which 
implies a higher heart disease risk. (API 7/16/96)&quot;</p> 
<p> 100 News Reports - Atkins' Diet Proven Better Than American Heart 
Associations' Low-Fat Diet.</p> 
<p>Scientific studies as reported in the European Heart Journal (1997) 18, 
18-22 show the low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is ineffective in reducing 
coronary heart disease, and one study showed an increase in deaths. The diet 
also results in an increase in deaths from other causes as in the case of Mr. 
Pritikin above.</p> 
<p>Increasing triglycerides and decreasing HDL creates a higher heart disease 
risk. Therefore, the low-fat, low-cholesterol diet proposed by Dr. Dean Ornish 
causes the cholesterol risk ratios to move in the wrong direction toward 
increasing heart disease risk. The Dr. Robert C. Atkins' low-carbohydrate diet 
greatly improves cholesterol risk ratios as shown in the table above and my own 
results sited above.</p>

Mons. Bernard. The diet was known and applied to athletes to achieve better 
performance but was not generally given to unhealthy or obese people to cure 
their ailments. Mr. Banting showed that it did. His book was highly criticized 
by the established medical community just as the low-carbohydrate diet is 
today. Mr. Banting proved all of the criticisms to be false. You can also read 
a brief summary ofThe Harvey-Banting Diet, Letter on Corpulence.</p> 
<p><b>Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes</b></p> 
<p>This is a must-read book. Gary Taubes is an award- winning scientist who 
has specialized in exposing misleading, incorrect, or fraudulent science. His 
seven- year research in every science connected with the impact of nutrition on 
health shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy 
diet is wrong. For decades we have been taught that fat is bad for us, 
carbohydrates are better, and that the key to a healthy weight is eating less 
and exercising more. Yet with more and more people acting on the advice, we 
have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes.</p> 
<p>Taubes argues persuasively that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates 
(white flour, sugar, easily digested starches) via their dramatic effect on 
insulin -- the hormone that regulates fat accumulation -- and that the key to 
good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number. There are good 
and bad calories. Taubes traces how the common assumption that carbohydrates 
are fattening was abandoned in the 1960s when fat and cholesterol were blamed 
for heart disease and then -- wrongly -- were seen as the causes of a host of 
other maladies, including cancer. He shows us how these unproven hypotheses 
were emphatically embraced by authorities in nutrition, public health, and 
clinical medicine in spite of how well-conceived clinical trials have 
consistently refuted them. He also documents the dietary trials of 
carbohydrate-restriction, which consistently show that the fewer carbohydrates 
we consume the leaner we will be.</p> 
<p>With precise references to the most significant existing clinical studies, 
he convinces us that there is no compelling scientific evidence demonstrating 
that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease; that salt causes high 
blood pressure; and that fiber is a necessary part of a healthy diet. Based on 
the evidence that does exist, he leads us to conclude that the only healthy way 
to lose weight and remain lean is to eat fewer carbohydrates or to change the 
type of carbohydrates we do eat and, for some of us, perhaps to eat virtually 
none at all.</p> </blockquote>

<p><i>Life Without Bread</i> is an important addition to the growing body of 
literature on the benefits and importance of the low-carb diet. Written by 
Christian Allan, Ph.D., and Wolfgang Lutz, M.D., the book is based on Dr. 
Lutz's experience using carbohydrate-restricted diets with thousands of 
patients for more than 40 years. It is also based on extensive research in the 
medical and scientific literature and provides ample references. The book 
presents a unified theory of how high (and even &quot;moderate&quot;) levels of 
dietary carbohydrate cause or exacerbate various health problems and how 
carbohydrate restriction can help people to recover from those problems.</p>

families of drugs, and later by FDA regulations, kickbacks to doctors from 
pharmaceutical companies, ghostwritten articles commissioned by pharmaceutical 
companies and attributed to independent doctors in trusted medical journals. 
Most importantly, Cohen discusses at length deadly and other irreversible side 
effects of new drugs, suggesting that warnings on drug packages are incomplete.

<p><b></b><b>P</b><b>rostate, Breast Cancer and Bone Loss Prevention</b></p> 
<p>The use of natural progesterone cream by men has been shown to prevent 
prostate cancer, strengthen bones and prevent male hair loss. Cancer and bone 
loss prevention has also been shown in women by using natural progesterone 
cream. Osteoporosis (bone loss) is a crippling disease that is preventable and 
reversible. Natural progesterone cream has been proven byDr. John R. Lee to 
restore and build bone in both men and women. The newer studies show that 
estrogen, specifically estradiol, does not increase the risk for breast cancer 
but it actually CAUSES breast cancer AND prostate cancer. There is not any 
debate left about this issue. All major researchers have found this to be true. 
The information on the prostate is new. This is MAJOR news and will provide a 
radical shift in my recommendations for hormonal replacement. I know believe 
that nearly all men should seriously consider natural progesterone replacement 
sometime in their 40s, or even earlier if they have a family history of 
prostate cancer. There is also a reasonable likelihood that this will decrease 
male balding. So, all the men who wish to retain what is left of their hair, I 
would start this immediately.&quot; Prostate health is a very complicated topic 
and there is much disagreement by physicians in the field about PSA testing, 
cancer detection and treatment.<br>
