<h2>Visionary Nutrition</h2> 
<p><strong>Greetings Friends!</strong> I wanted to share an article by my good 
friend<em>Morgan Maher</em>, the host of the my upcoming online workshop on 
&ldquo;Visionary Nutrition&rdquo;. &nbsp;I think it is an inspired and poignant 
summation of the plant medicine path, and especially the<em>synthesis</em> of 
<strong>food</strong>, <strong>medicine</strong>, and the realm of <strong>
entheogenic plants</strong> in the human ecological niche. <em> If you are 
interested in joining us for this online workshop just click the banner below.

<p><em>Enjoy the article and let us know what you think!</em></p>

<h2>Food Medicine Life</h2> 
<p>by Morgan Maher</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;As we begin (once again) to naturalize ourselves &ndash; both 
nutritionally and medicinally &ndash; we may begin to discover that there is 
far more to a plant than just its chemical composition, more than just its list 
of constituent phyto-nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Rather, and more vital 
to our personal healing &ndash; as well as to the continuation of life as we 
know it &ndash; is our becoming acquainted with the organism producing the food 
or medicine itself. With the life-form, the being.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>-Daniel Vitalis</em></p> 
<p><em>~</em></p> 
<p>Visionary Nutrition. This is a path of uniting stories. An open source 
invitation into deeper relation with the many things that fuel, heal, and 
energize us; that which is alive all around us, co-creates<em>with </em>us. 
This a path of dissolving separation. A path of connectivity.</p> 
<p>It is the strengthened engagement with the harmony of humanity &ndash; the 
beautiful songs we&rsquo;ve sung and are singing, our peak performance, the 
best of the best &ndash; that boils down to our collective necessities &ndash; 
food, medicine, life &ndash; from which can be drawn ever-expanding analogies, 
inter-elated metaphor, and metamorphosis.</p> 
<p>It is here all around us; Eden, Heaven &ndash; find it in an apple. Got 
Demons? Join forces with a vine. Eat garbage conjured and sold by the darkest 
magicians &ndash; become &ldquo;Stay Puft Marshmallow Man&rdquo;; your 
ill-conceived nightmares. Invite the forces of nature, say an orange or a 
mushroom, and with the right kind of eyes &ndash; grow further infused with 
infinite ecologies of everlasting spirits.</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;What ayahuasca teaches is that right now, at every moment, we 
already live in the magic forest.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>-Steve Beyer</em></p> 
<p>Dig around a bit, and you might observe the root of our crisis as being 
humankind&rsquo;s long, drunken lust for separation &ndash; mind/body, 
human/nature, food/medicine, physical/spiritual. Simultaneously, it is these 
elements which<em>unite </em>our species, and always have. We all participate, 
we all dance with these elements &ndash; and it is these elements that, by and 
large, make up our world. We create worlds, as worlds creates us.</p> 
<p>But we <em>are </em>new here &ndash; sometimes awesome, but ultimately 
amateur, and we&rsquo;ve been grasping. We simply cannot believe it. Timelapse 
the situation and it&rsquo;s like we appeared only yesterday &ndash; 
instantaneously &ndash; in ever-changing form, on a particular planet.</p> 
<p>Growing in size, staring at our hands, finding our feet, rubbing our 
eyeballs, mind boggled &ndash; immersed, surrounded, and face to face with an 
overwhelming presence perceived, at times, as threatening.</p> 
<p>We dash for the door, or some way out. We invoke separation, like children 
covering their ears &ndash; convinced it&rsquo;s not happening. Running in 
circles, making mirages, chasing dragons, ouroborically awestruck, deaf, blind 
and dumbfounded by this life, the afterlife, reality and its alternatives, 
ghosts, dreams, philosophy, the powers that be, the secret life of plants 
&ndash; all this raging intricacy.</p> 
<p>Yet we appear now to see eye to eye with the storm. This quiet, ripping 
whorl, where time is in question, and of its essence. Where the consensus 
amongst the conscious is that we are indeed all one, we<em>are </em>nature, 
there is no separation, and it&rsquo;s all changing dramatically. Be ithomo 
nexus, homo luminous, neo aboriginalis, or Sylvapolitans &ndash; it&rsquo;s on, 
and it&rsquo;s your choice. Merge with the Maelstrom, let Gaia absorb you. 
Produce solutions &ndash; dissolve.</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;The fiction that supports the culture-nature separation is 
rapidly failing under the weight of its own inconsistencies. It is becoming 
obvious that what we do to nature we do to ourselves, what we do to ourselves 
we do to nature.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>-Morgan Brent</em></p> 
<p>All plants are psychoactive. Everything has a spirit. You can learn a lot 
from Arugula &ndash; even more from Cacao, or from an elder like Maize. What we 
place inside ourselves, transforms us. Eating and drinking is intimate 
communication. Daily comm-union, even telepathy, most often one-way, where a 
plant invited into the human body as food or medicine can &ldquo;see what you 
mean&rdquo;. From it nothing is hidden and it knows what&rsquo;s what &ndash; 
so it provides certain answers in the form of nourishment &ndash; literally; 
&ldquo;bringing (you) up, raising, fostering, supporting, preserving&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Be it food or information &ndash; we become what we consume, and we produce 
from the inside out. When we eat and drink &ndash; we practice relationship 
with different forces, with spirits and sentience. We are what we eat, and what 
we eat runs the show.</p> 
<p>Plants, fungi and bacteria are significantly adept at piloting humans. 
Michael Pollan, for example, explores this extensively and convincingly in his 
work, posing the question: &ldquo;What if we are all just pawns in corn&rsquo;s 
clever strategy game to rule the Earth?&rdquo;. Further, Pollan suggests, in 
his &ldquo;Plants-eye view&rdquo; Ted Talk, that &ldquo;Looking at the world 
from other species&rsquo; points of view is a cure for the disease of human 
self-importance.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If plants &ndash; specifically Teacher Plants &ndash; convey anything, it 
is that they have the upper hand, the higher branch. They can throw you down, 
clean you up, send you out to space, thrust you on a new paths, make you change 
your ways, whisper advice, keep you warm, dry, sheltered, alive, and in some 
cases, even kill you.</p> 
<p>Essentially, plants can do whatever they want with humans, and with 
near-absolute impunity. Our species&rsquo; &ldquo;ultimate verdict&rdquo; is 
the concept of death. But to a plant, death is laughable. A sentiment 
reinforced in a recent New York Times Magazine article describing the plant 
take-over of New Orleans&rsquo; Lower Ninth Ward, where &ldquo;For six and a 
half years, the neighborhood has undergone a reverse colonization &mdash; 
nature reclaiming civilization.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Have you ever seen plants <em>happen? </em>Plants, and plant-time, are like 
crop circles (which of course are made of plants in most cases) &ndash; like 
magic, they appear, leave traces, clues, fruit, messages. In the New Orleans 
&ldquo;Jungleland&rdquo; &ndash; behind climates of chaos and the media 
newsfeed, burnt cars and dead bodies are consumed by tall grass.</p> 
<p>Side with the plants, learn plants, eat plants, <em>become </em>plants 
&ndash; let food be your medicine, let medicine be your food &ndash; and begin 
to synthesize entirely different dimensions of time, technology, communication, 
and potential.</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;In order to live a magical life, you have to eat magical 
food&rdquo;<br>
 -David Wolfe</em></p> 
<p>Several years ago, during <em>dieta </em>with Ayahuasca, the plants 
suggested to me that &ldquo;ayahuasca would go best with raw food&rdquo;. 
Plants, I&rsquo;ve found, often speak in terms of one&rsquo;s present 
perception &ndash; in shapeshifting symbols that change as you follow them, 
conversations to discern and decipher. With this in mind, I set forth exploring 
a raw food diet &ndash; with sharp eyes and a healthy aversion to dogma and 
definitions. However, the heart of this guidance was clear: Ayahuasca, once 
drank, prefers to live in, and works better with; clean bodies.</p> 
<p>I eventually engaged and evolved my raw food/living diet path as a kind of 
inverted version of a<em>Plant Dieta. </em>Something I could practice daily as 
a way to learn from, and build relations with numerous &ldquo;common&rdquo; 
plants like Kale, Chard, Chia, Blueberries, Tomatoes, Pears, for example. As 
though I was, or have been, turning myself into some kind of garden. Into 
which, ayahuasca digs deep, purging junk, transforming thoughts, composting 
things, creating soil from soul, turning the stomach into a womb, encouraging 
conditions right, good, and fertile &ndash; so it can root, grow, and flower.
</p> 
<p>Raw, living diets take many forms. From my perspective it&rsquo;s a kind of 
plant artistry. Plant-based edible living sculpture with vibrant living beings 
who in return sculpt you. Essentially though, it is process of healing and 
strengthening. Significantly, it&rsquo;s a<em>cleanse </em>&ndash; of body, of 
mind &ndash; and by extension, environment.</p> 
<p>From yet another direction, the &ldquo;higher reflection&rdquo; in a sense 
the<em>Mother </em>of raw, living diets, can be seen in the traditions and 
disciplines of<em>Plant Dietas. </em>Commonly referred to and often mistaken as 
&ldquo;the ayahuasca diet&rdquo;<em>- Plant Dietas </em>are, in <em>very </em>
general terms; a discipline and process of cleansing, purging, healing, 
learning, and building right-relationship. During<em>Plant Dietas, </em>one is 
isolated, eats very little, and/or very simply, in order to remove 
distractions, sensitize one&rsquo;s body/mind/spirit to the subtleties of the 
spirit world, to become transparent, lucid and focused in it. A student-teacher 
relationship emerges as one sits with a plant, drinking it exclusively over a 
period of time.</p> 
<p>Working safely and respectfully with Ayahuasca and other Teacher Plants, 
alongside raw food/garden-variety plants, the Teacher&rsquo;s Assistants so to 
speak, leads, of course, to many physical and spiritual benefits. The plants 
led me out of concrete jungles, cured any concrete ideologies and crumbling 
health I might carry &ndash; hold my gaze and engage my commitment to unfolding 
endeavors of evolutionary advantage &ndash; wild foods, living water, 
permaculture, forest gardening, medicinal mushrooms, herbalism, 
synaesthesia&hellip;</p> 
<p>Yet perhaps most importantly, the process has opened, and continues to 
expand, a certain grand<em>permeability &ndash; </em>pathways and bridges 
between common ground and the sky &ndash; between day-to-day and ceremonial 
nights.</p> 
<p><em>~</em></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;I think that once a person is aware of the life in everything, 
they can begin to access the spirit of everything. And once they can do that 
they can interact with those spirits. I&rsquo;m talking about the spirit of the 
creek, the bricks in your house, the hundreds of spirits roaming your kitchen.
</em></p> 
<p><em>This universe is full full full of life and life force. The roll of 
shamanic knowledge for us westerners introduced to those spirits is to spread 
that knowledge, make communication easier. And if we can do that&ndash;a big 
task, no doubt&ndash;then the way people interact with the world and the 
spirits of the world and universe will change, automatically, from one of 
dominance to one of cooperation. And when we, mankind, begin interacting with 
the world, rather than trying to dominate it, well, I think mankind will be 
better off. The world and its spirits don&rsquo;t really care if we do, for the 
most part. Trees will be here long after we&rsquo;re gone, and so will stones 
and bricks and clouds and the moon. So it&rsquo;s really up to us to take an 
interest if we are to make the friendship of those spirits.</em></p> 
<p><em>And thus far, for most of us throughout mankind&rsquo;s short history 
on this planet, that effort has not been made. Which has left us losing out on 
so much we might have learned. Who knows what we have missed simply by not 
asking a plant what benefit it might have for mankind, rather than saying 
&ldquo;tree, chop it and burn it for fire.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>I think the universe has all the secrets of the universe. And our 
arrogance in trying to continually conquer the universe rather than communicate 
with it, has kept us from being taught those secrets. And how delicious they 
might be!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>It was a tremendous honor to be a part of the new documentary film <strong>
&ldquo;Hungry For Change&rdquo;</strong>. &nbsp; <strong>Click here to see the 
full length film for FREE between now and March 31st!</strong> The film exposes 
the myths and mistruths that the diet-fad and processed food industries have 
perpetrated on a mis-educated populace for so many years. &nbsp;We are now 
awakening from the last few decades of over-fed / under-nourished slumber and 
collectively reclaiming our Sovereign Health! This film is a beautiful 
depiction of how that is happening. &nbsp;I really feel that this movie has the 
potential to make some real change in the lives of people you know, so please 
turn your friends and loved ones onto it as well!</p> 
<p>Join me on my upcoming radio show with Patrick Timpone on <strong>March

psychoactive plants in the human ecological and dietary niche</strong>.  Homo 
sapiens have a long and rich history with psychoactive plant medicines, and 
they have always been a part of our traditional diets. &nbsp;What role do 
psychoactive&rsquo;s play today, and if they are no longer represented in our 
food supply, is it possible that we can become &ldquo;alkaloid 
deficient&rdquo;? &nbsp;This online workshop will delve deeply into human 
domestication and the affects of an alkaloid-poor diet. &nbsp;Click here to

<h2>Pine Pollen Book now available!</h2> 
<p>Greetings ReWilder&rsquo;s!</p> 
<p>I am really excited to announce the release of the new book &nbsp;
&ldquo;Pine Pollen, Ancient Medicine for A New Millennium&rdquo;, &nbsp;by 
Stephen Harrod Buhner. &nbsp;I had the privilege of both publishing this book 
as well as writing the foreword, and am very excited to see it added &nbsp;to 
the existing herbal literature.</p> 
<p>This project began a few years back when I read Stephen&rsquo;s outstanding 
book &ldquo;The Natural Testosterone Plan&rdquo;. &nbsp;Actually, I was reading 
a few of his books and found myself particularly spellbound by the section on 
Pine Pollen and its incredible androgenic effects. &nbsp;My company,SurThrival, 
became the first to bring a fully developed Pine Pollen product line to the 
natural foods market place in North America. &nbsp;I had met Stephen at a 
workshop he gave in British Columbia (here is an interview I did with him) and 
having become friends, asked if he would be willing to collaborate with myself 
and the SurThrival team on a Pine Pollen herbal-monograph. Stephen, having 
studied Pine Pollen extensively, had much to share on the subject. &nbsp;The 
results are his latest book which you can find here.</p> 
<p>Stephen was sure to include extensive sections on the historical use of 
Pine Pollen in various traditional medicine systems, its chemistry, as well as 
its androgen profile, dosages for use, and yes&hellip; &nbsp;Even how you can 
harvest your own! &nbsp;The entire book is extensively footnoted so that you 
can access the scientific literature from which so much of this information has 
been compiled.</p> 
<p>The following is a short excerpt from the opening pages of the book:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Although the Western world has been undergoing its greatest herbal 
renaissance in over a century the medicinal actions of trees are often 
overlooked, perhaps none more so than pine. Given the drive for new plant 
medicines and the continual search for a new herb-of-the-day that will simulate 
excitement in the general populace (e.g. rhodiola, maca), it is astonishing 
that pine has been unrecognized for so long. This is particularly perplexing 
since the pollen of pine trees has been used for millennia in China and Korea 
as both food and a particularly powerful tonic and adaptogen, especially for 
the elderly.</p> 
<p>Thousands of Chinese herbs have entered the Western pharmacopoeia; the 
earliest and best known is perhaps ginseng. Pine pollen, given its potency, its 
similarity to ginseng in some of its actions, and its status as, perhaps,<em>the
</em> premier phytoandrogen on the planet, should have been recognized long 
before now as the powerful medicinal it is. This monograph is intended to 
remedy that oversight and help establish it as one of the most important 
medicinals in the herbalist&rsquo;s repertory.&rdquo; &nbsp;- Stephen Harrod 
Buhner</p> 
<p>I suspect you will all enjoy this book as much as I have enjoyed being a 
part of it. &nbsp;Stephen, in addition to being a prolific writer on herbal 
craft and lore, is a poet and word-smith par excellence.</p> 
<p>To your health and prosperity,</p>

<h2>Is Hollywood ReWilding?</h2> 
<p>Greetings Friends &amp; Welcome to 2012!</p> 
<p>This past autumn was a really exciting time for my team and I, with so many 
of our projects coming to fruition and our message of<em>ReWilding</em>, <em>
Spring Water</em>, and <em>Indigenous Nutrition</em> spreading around our 
community and beyond, faster than we ever imagined.</p> 
<p>I want to extend a big thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Longevity Now Conference</em> 
for all they have done to make this happen. Check out this 12 minute video clip 
(click on the image below) of the talk I delivered in Costa Mesa last October 
titled,&nbsp;<strong><em>&ldquo;Developing Sovereign Health: The Path of 
&nbsp;Rewilding Ourselves&rdquo;</em></strong>.<strong> </strong>If you would 
like to see the rest of thetalk, as well as those presented by the rest of the 
Longevity Now speakers,&nbsp;<strong>it is available here.</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Rewild Yourself: Tips &amp; Tricks for Strengthening Your Epigenetic 
Health&quot;</p> 
<p>I also want to share this <strong>quick video clip</strong> of my good 
friend Shailene Woodley&rsquo;s appearance on the<strong><em>Late Night With 
Jimmy Fallon Show</em></strong> (check out that clip right here)! &nbsp;She was 
so kind as to mention my name and the work I have been doing the last several 
years! &nbsp;Shailene has become a tremendous ally, helping to share the 
message of<em>ReWilding</em>, <em>Spring Water</em>, and <em>Indigenous 
Nutrition</em> with the world. &nbsp;Recently, she also appeared on the Ellen 
Degeneres Show carrying a mason jar of spring water which she promptly shared 
with Ellen!</p> 
<p>Here is a recent interview with her in Black Book Magazine titled 
&ldquo;Eating Clay and Super Humans&rdquo;! She talks about <em>foraging</em>, 
<em>spring water</em> and her daily <em>clay consumption!</em></p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know Shailene&rsquo;s work, check out her latest film,
<em> <strong>The Descendants</strong></em>, where she co-stars alongside <em>
George Clooney</em>. &nbsp;<strong>Shailene, from all of us, Thank You for all 
that you are doing!</strong></p> 
<p>Lastly I want to share the link to the newly rebuilt SurThrival website! 
&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great place to stock up on great winter immune system 
supplements, such as Medicinal Mushroom Extracts and Colostrum. &nbsp;I am so 
proud ofSurThrival as a project, as a company, and as a team! &nbsp;<em>Thanks 
to all of you who have supported us!</em> We are constantly working to serve 
you better!</p> 
<p>Thats all for now!</p> 
<p>Keep on ReWilding Yourself!</p>

<h2>Neti Pots: Nasal Irrigation to Smog-Proof Your Sinuses</h2> 
<p><em>How is your sinus hygiene?</em></p> 
<p>After 14 years of using a neti pot on a regular, almost daily basis &ndash; 
I must admit, I am amazed how overlooked this basic bit of personal hygiene is.
</p> 
<p>Most of us brush our teeth and we usually expect the same of others. 
&nbsp;In fact, when someone neglects this important bit of personal 
cleanliness, the rest of us can be easily turned off.</p> 
<p>How about bathing? &nbsp;What if you knew someone hadn&rsquo;t showered or 
bathed in months, years, or worse still, never at all&hellip; &nbsp;How would 
you feel about getting&hellip; um, close to them?</p> 
<p><strong>Well, how about our sinuses?</strong> Each day we are all breathing 
the many stow-away particles (read: pollutants) that free float amongst what 
was once, some pretty fresh air here on planet earth. Today our air is loaded 
with everything from dust (which is mostly dead skin cells) to heavy metals, 
from car exhaust to radioactive isoptopes. &nbsp;These particles are constantly 
lodging in and congesting our upper respiratory tract, creating an environment 
for infection and/or being drawn still deeper into our lower respiratory tract 
(our lungs). &nbsp;The neti pot gives us the ability to clean our upper 
respiratory tract, in much the same way that a toothbrush cleans our mouth or a 
shower washes our skin, before these particles can accumulate or be drawn 
deeper.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, we simply carry this debris around, haphazardly sneezing or 
blowing it out, or letting it drain back into our throats&hellip; &nbsp;Blah!
</p> 
<p><em>Want to see what a truly clean upper respiratory tract feels like? 
&nbsp;Try using a neti pot!</em></p> 
<p>After a few days, to a few weeks, of implementing this practice it will 
become immediately clear why I am recommending it. &nbsp;My experience has been 
that you can only truly feel the chronic congestion after you have cleared it. 
&nbsp;It is the open, clear, and relaxed sense of breathing; the ability to 
fully utilize your respiration that makes you conscious of its importance. 
&nbsp;In other words, once you have tried it and felt what clean and clear 
sinus cavities feel like, you won&rsquo;t want to go back.</p> 
<p><strong>As for the technique and specifics, I will let this video explain 
the rest.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My company <strong>SurThrival</strong> recently started carrying what we 
feel are the most beautiful and durable ceramic neti pots available anywhere, 
and<strong>you can get one for yourself right here</strong> on our newly 
designed website (we are pretty excited about this)! &nbsp;We were sure to get 
them in several different colors so that you can choose one thats right for 
you. &nbsp;These are made right here in the State of Maine (where we are based 
out of) and I have personally tested them now for almost a decade and a half, 
so I can honestly tell you they are the best around. &nbsp;Watch the video 
above where I compare some of the features against other design-styles.</p> 
<p>If your looking to smog proof your sinuses, help to prevent sinus issues in 
general, and improve your respiratory health, give the neti pot a try. &nbsp;
<em>Better yet, take some time to develop mastery of this skill by making it a 
regular practice!</em></p> 
<p>My hope is that our community will immediately see the value of this handy 
little device and add it to the tool-belt of practices and skills that are 
helping us&nbsp;to thrive in, and adapt to our modern environment. &nbsp;I 
promise if you give it just one week of consistent practice, not only will you 
easily master this skill, but you will have a life long practice that will 
contribute to your health and personal detoxification strategy.</p> 
<p>I have used this strategy, along side others, such as regular sauna use 
(check out&nbsp;<strong>Clearlight Saunas</strong>, it is the brand of infrared 
sauna that I have in my home), a clean whole food diet containing lots of wild 
foods and herbs,drinking natural spring water, implimenting regular functional

<p>On this interview, Daniel will be speaking about&nbsp;his latest research 
into the<em>reclassification</em> of modern humans as a new subspecies. 
&nbsp;It is a wild new idea that comes from the effects our modern lifestyle 
has had on our epi-genome and our health. &nbsp;Because our epi-genetics are 
influenced by everything in our environment, the lifestyle we have lived has 
shaped us into some new and all together different creature. &nbsp;The concept 
of &ldquo;<em>rewilding</em>&rdquo; is about <em>recreating</em> or replicating 
some of our natural conditions to make us<em>healthier</em> and more <em>robust
</em>. &nbsp;Daniel will be&nbsp;sharing tips on the kinds of things a person

<h2>Sovereign Dental Health, a 6 Part Strategy</h2> 
<p>Hello Friends,</p> 
<p>Welcome (or welcome back) and thanks again for stopping by. &nbsp;My last 
few videos have been focused on sharing some&nbsp;Sovereign Self-Healthcare 
strategies that I have been developing and employing for some time now. 
&nbsp;It has been really exciting to share these with you all, and for me it 
feels like a timely message, given the considerable distrust and 
dissatisfaction so many of us have been feeling for mainstream 
&ldquo;medicine&rdquo; in recent years.</p> 
<p>Many of us have taken our diets and nutrition into our own hands, though 
when it comes to personal health care, few of us have really stepped out and 
away from the entrenched medical system&rsquo;s doctor/dentist treatment, and 
the role we play in it as &ldquo;patient&rdquo; (from the Latin meaning 
&ldquo;suffering&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>This current video is a 6 part dental health and maintenance strategy that 
has replaced the role of dentistry in my life. &nbsp;It has been many years 
since I have seen a dentist (I was 12 the last time I can remember having an 
appointment with one), and as it is with so many aspects of living, I have 
found it far more rewarding to take care of myself, rather than turning my 
health over to others. Especially those &ldquo;quacks&rdquo; &ndash; originally 
a term reserved for dentists who employed mercury amalgam fillings &ndash; with 
less than shiny-white histories (e.g. fluoride, mercury, etc).</p> 
<p>The world of &ldquo;modern medicine&rdquo;, to include modern dentistry, 
seems far less interested in our health than it does in furthering its 
quasi-scientific agendas, human experiemention, and profit driven procedures. 
&nbsp;For this reason I will continue to promote Sovereign Self-health Care 
Strategies here at DanielVitalis.com.</p> 
<p>ReWild Yourself! This doesn&rsquo;t refer to behaving wildly, or 
&nbsp;giving up your standards of personal conduct, rather it means &ldquo;Shed 
your Domesticator&ldquo;!</p> 
<p>This video is for all of you who celebrate being grown-ups, and are 
unafraid to raise yourselves up and out of the near ubiquitousneoteny that is 
now standard in the epi-genome in our &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; population.</p> 
<p>This video comes on the heels of&nbsp;the last video we released, which 
details how to make the toothpaste that is used in this dental care strategy. 
&nbsp;Please keep in mind that this toothpaste, in addition to providing the 
mild abrasive qualities we have become accustomed to in our commercially 
available toothpaste preparations, is designed to pull toxic cations out of the 
body, and to be an aid in our overall radio-protection strategy (protection 
from radioactive isotopes).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For those of you who are interested in going deeper, I would highly 
recommend an e-book by my good friend Nadine Artemis called<strong>
&ldquo;Successful Self-Dentistry, how to avoid the dentist without ignoring 
your teeth&rdquo;</strong>.  This e-book is very comprehensive, and empowers us 
to take our dental health into our own hands for a lifetime.</p> 
<p>We are now getting ready for Ancestral Ignition, a workshop that myself and 
some good friends are hosting here at my home in Maine,<strong>September 16th 
&ndash; 18th, 2011</strong>. &nbsp;The main focus of this retreat is to share 
the<em>ancient</em> and <em>ancestral</em> skill of aboriginal friction fire 
with all of those who attend. &nbsp;We really believe that stewardship of this 
ancient fire-craft is valuable for many reasons, not the least of which is the 
carrying on of what is one of our most ancient and fundamental human 
technologies.</p> 
<p>Our ability to generate and maintain fire is a <strong>powerful</strong> 
thing indeed, so it is our intention to pass on not just the skill, but the 
ethics of stewardship as well.</p> 
<p>We also feel privileged to share the basics of fire-craft with our friends 
and clients because so many of us were never taught how to properly or 
efficiently build or maintain a fire. &nbsp;I certainly wasn&rsquo;t, growing 
up in the 1980&rsquo;s American Dream. &nbsp;In fact, learning to properly 
construct and burn a fire has meant far more to me than just having another 
survival skill. &nbsp;It has connected me with one of the essential practices 
that makes us human.</p> 
<p>This workshop will be fully catered with <strong>organic</strong>, <strong>
local</strong> food, prepared by Chef Frank Giglio, who is one of my best 
friends and a truly culinary mentor of mine.</p> 
<p>Check out the video below to hear more about <strong><em>Ancestral Ignition
</em></strong>, and to see acclaimed botanist, author, and my foraging and 
aboriginal skills guide and&nbsp;all around friend,&nbsp;Arthur Haines, make a 
fire with a primitive tool known as the bow drill.</p> 
<p></p>

Ignition please contact us atinfo@danielvitalis.com.</h4>

<h2>How to make your own Detoxifying Toothpaste, and details on my annual trip 
to Peru</h2> 
<p>Greetings Friends, thanks for stopping by.</p> 
<h3>Would you like to make your own toothpaste for self-dentistry and 
detoxification?</h3> 
<p>The video below is an installment in dental health sovereignty. &nbsp;It 
has been working very well for me, and it just might work for you too.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For years I have been looking for the right toothpaste for my home 
self-dentistry, and have experimented with a great many things. &nbsp;From 
&ldquo;organic&rdquo; store-bought toothpaste brands, to tooth soaps and 
powders, and even aboriginal &ldquo;chew sticks&rdquo; &ndash; Nothing has been 
the right fit for my self-dentistry needs.</p> 
<p>I have now arrived at a strategy that is really working wonders for me, and 
I feel could really work for you too. &nbsp;This video is the first part of 
that strategy, the rest of which I am eager to share with you in full over the 
next few weeks.</p> 
<h3>How I arrived at this&hellip;</h3> 
<p>As I began experimenting with tissue detoxification using Zeolites and 
Clay, it dawned on me that these, when rendered into a fine flour-like powder, 
have just the right amount of abrasiveness to take the place of the toothpaste 
I had grown up with.</p> 
<h4><em>This video details how you can make your own, and at a very low price 
at that. &nbsp;In fact, if you know where to look, you could get everything you 
would need for making all the toothpaste you would use for the rest of your 
life for probably under $100!</em></h4> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Best of all, you can swallow this toothpaste, which yields all of the 
amazing health benefits of these detoxifying earth compounds. &nbsp;In 
particular I am referring to zeolites ability to perform cation exchange -&nbsp;
CEC or Cation Exchange Capacity is the term used in physics- which is its 
ability to electrically bind positively charged ions (heavy metals, 
radio-isotopes, etc) whilst trading out (in exchange) beneficial cations like 
potassium or calcium. &nbsp;The toxic cations are then transported out of our 
bodies, along with the zeolite powder in our bowel movement. &nbsp;The case 
with clay is very similar, though the phenomena in this case is referred to as
adsorption, which is also an electrical binding, but in this case to the 
surface of the clay particle and without the accompanying exchange of a cation.
</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that this practice, consuming clay and other earth compounds, 
is perhaps one of the oldest of all human behaviors. &nbsp;It has been 
practiced around the world and is present in virtually all pre-industrial 
populations. &nbsp;Evidence for this has been found in archeological sites that 
predated our current human form, and anthropological surveys have found that it 
lives on in societies around the world today. &nbsp;Actually, it is common to 
nearly all mammals, and in particular to broad ranging herbivores. &nbsp;The 
behavior is termed&ldquo;geophagy&rdquo;, and is unquestionably part of the 
species-specific diet of human beings. &nbsp;From my perspective, it appears 
that a diet that lacks the geophagy pattern could not be called a 
&ldquo;natural diet&rdquo; at all, as it would essentially be deficient in 
these all-important compounds. &nbsp;Below is a link to one of the best books I 
have read on the subject.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>  null <br>
 null </p> 
<p>Most of us were taught to spit our toothpaste out, which, given the host of 
less-than-beneficial ingredients (particularly fluoride) is pretty sound 
advice. &nbsp;With this home-made clay or zeolite toothpaste, the goal is 
indeed to swallow it, moving it into the intestine where it can go to work 
mopping up industrial and nuclear debris that has bioaccumulated in our tissues.
</p> 
<p>When this clay or zeolite consumption&nbsp;is combined with sauna therapy 
(this dual approach is the subject ofmy last video), we arrive at a very 
effective life-long detoxification strategy that really works, and is easy to 
implement.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>This second video is about my August 4th, 11 day tour of Peru, for which I 
have just a few openings left.</h3> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you are looking for a riveting adventure, are interested in Peruvian 
shamanism, amazonian biology, visiting Machu Pichu, or just wanting to soak in 
a rain forest hotspring, this trip might be for you. &nbsp;We are less than a 
month away, so if you would like to join us &ndash; by us I mean the very 
amazing and interesting group of people who have assembled for this trip 
&ndash; contactJeannette at info@rawflora.com, and check out the 11 day 10 
night itinerary here. &nbsp;It is exciting to see who takes the plunge and 
comes along!</p> 
<p>Please let us know what you thought about the video above, and if there are 
any subjects you would like to see covered in the future.</p> 
<p>Until then, please know that your readership is appreciated.</p> 
<p>Enjoy the summer sunshine!</p>

<h2>Coconut Water in Maine??? The First Wild Food of the Season!</h2> 
<p>Ok, so of course Maine hasn&rsquo;t got any coconuts, but we do have 
something that tastes just as good &ndash; maybe better &ndash; and is just as 
nutritious.<br>
</p> 
<p>Its the sap of the Maple tree. </p> 
<p>There are not many wild foods that taste particularly sweet here in New 
England, but Maple Syrup is certainly the exception. &nbsp;Whats more, the 
flowing sap of the maple tree is the first wild food to emerge after a long and 
cold snow covered New England winter.</p> 
<p>This video is a quick peek into my spring cleansing strategy which is most 
welcomed after a lengthy season of living indoors. &nbsp;The fresh Maple sap is 
so refreshing, so hydrating, and tastes so good that it is almost shocking that 
more people aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of this delicious, abundant, and free 
late winter/early spring drink! &nbsp;In the second half of the video 
I&rsquo;ve included a recipe that I have been making with fresh maple water, 
chaga, and a bit of cream. &nbsp;I wish there was some way to convey flavor 
through the internet! Is there an app for that yet?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To compliment and expand on my video, I have also included a video with 
botanist Arthur Haines detailing how he taps his maples, and prepares his maple 
syrup. &nbsp;With childlike enthusiasm, we have been texting back and forth 
each day to see how much sap the others trees have produced!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The experience of procuring food directly from wild nature is truly, for me 
at least, one of the great joys of living! As each season goes by and my skills 
in this area increase, not only have I developed a strong sense of food 
security, my direct relationship to the Earth as an abundant and loving 
provider continues to increases. &nbsp;To say that I am grateful would hardly 
do justice to this exuberant emotion.</p> 
<p>For those of you who are interested in developing more wild food 
identification, harvesting, and processing skills, please consider joining 
Arthur and I for ourAncestral Plants workshop here in Maine, May 6th &ndash; 
8th, 2011. &nbsp;Be sure to contact us soon, as the class size is very limited. 
We have chosen the intimate class size to ensure that each of you gets the 
close personal attention you need, and to ensure that we don&rsquo;t trample 
our wild foraging grounds. &nbsp;The class has been filling up rather quickly 
these last few weeks, and we are getting very excited for the spring foraging 
to begin!</p> 
<p>I have a few more days of maple sap harvesting before heading of to Los 
Angeles for the Longevity Now Conference, April 1st -3rd. &nbsp;I have just 
finished preparing my presentation, called &ldquo;Habitat, Your Guide to 
Intentional Lifestyle Design&rdquo; which will focus on specific strategies for 
more than just vigorous health, but epi-genetic wealth. &nbsp;In other words, 
we can use our environment and lifestyle to activate our genetic potential for 
a more robust experience of life on Earth! &nbsp;The newly emerging scientific 
field of &ldquo;epigenetics&rdquo; is rapidly confirming the obvious fact, our 
habitat and lifestyle choices, from what we eat and breath to what we wear and 
think not only impacts our health but actually influences our gene expression! 
&nbsp;Many of you are already planning on being there, and those who would like 
to join canget your tickets here. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t make it to the 
event, but would like to watch the video stream, here isthe link where you can 
sign up to watch at home.</p> 
<p>I am so enthusiastic about this upcoming foraging and touring season. 
&nbsp;I have events planned around the US, Canada, and even in Peru. Keep 
checking mycurrent events for more details, and I hope to meet you somewhere 
out there soon!</p> 
<p>Keep ReWilding,</p>

<h2>Urban Foraging Florida!</h2> 
<h1>The Brazilian Pink Peppercorn</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p>Tampa Bay was the site of another example of an urban forage, and this time 
with an exotic invasive that produces more food than I could ever hope to 
harvest.</p> 
<p>Branches bowed under the weight of pinkish-red berries as I sped across the 
highway on a recent trip to Southern Florida last December. &nbsp;Hour after 
hour I burned to know and meet the species who&rsquo;s berry drupes splatter 
painted pink the otherwise indistinguishable wall of sub-tropic greenery that 
lined the &nbsp;highway 75. &nbsp;Was it edible, and if so could I make the 
time to harvest some of it before my flight home? &nbsp;Finally curiosity got 
the better of me, and I decided to do what any avid forager would &ndash; 
&nbsp;I &nbsp;pulled over to have a taste. &nbsp;I know what your thinking, 
shouldn&rsquo;t I identify the plant<em>before </em>I taste it? &nbsp;Probably, 
but I didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;I have a good sense of the tastes of poisons, and 
this strategy has rarely failed me ( I will spare you the tale of the time I 
tried a taste of &ldquo;Jack-in-the-pulpit&rdquo;. &nbsp;Ooops!) &nbsp;The 
exotic sweet and spicy aromatic flavor of these brittle pink berries was well 
worth the risk, and I was certain I was on the trail of a new wild food ally.
</p> 
<p>It only took a few moments of internet research to discover the identity of 
this wildly successful invasive.&nbsp;It was Schinus terebinthifolius, the 
Brazilian Pink Peppercorn, and while not a true peppercorn, it is the pink 
berry we all have seen in the high end peppercorn blends and fancy see-through 
peppermills.</p> 
<p>This plant, once planted ornamentally is&nbsp;now Southern Florida&rsquo;s 
most noxious invasive, and today is illegal to plant, sell, or transport within 
the state! &nbsp;It is quickly claiming more and more habitat for itself, 
displacing native species from their long held habitat.</p> 
<p>And while this presents ecological issues in Southern Florida, it produces 
a tremendous surplus of wild food for the keenly aware forager. &nbsp;One of 
the great things about a plant like this, is there there is no concern of over 
harvest. &nbsp;Due to its status as Florida&rsquo;s floral-enemy-number-one, we 
can harvest its berries with a kind of impunity that is rarely experienced by 
the modern forager.</p> 
<p>Having harvested several pounds of these beautiful pink peppercorns, they 
are now dried and jarred, and have become a staple of my ever increasingly wild 
food rich diet. &nbsp;They provide an exotic spiciness to any dish, from sweet 
to savory, and they come with the added percieved benefit of being from my own 
personal harvest.</p> 
<p>While I hadn&rsquo;t had personal experience with this plant before, I do 
have plenty of experience with the principles of wild food identification, 
harvest, and processing, and each of these skills translate well from biome to 
biome, from one eco-system to the next.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in developing this skill set as well, or if you have 
experience but are ready to go deeper please check out myAncestral Plants 
workshop this May in Southern Maine! It is 3 days long, catered by Chef Frank 
Giglio with all local organic and wild food, and taught by myself and wild food 
expertArthur Haines. &nbsp;It is the wild food apprenticeship you have been 
waiting for! &nbsp;I hope to see you there!</p> 
<p>In the meantime, check out the video below to see the harvest and 
processing of these beautifully blush bunches of berries!</p>

<h2>New Book Now Available! Ancestral Plants</h2> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Finally, a Wild Food and Medicine book that really delivers!</h2> 
<p>My good friend Arthur Haines has just released his new book Ancestral 
Plants, and I must say, it is amongst the best wild food and plant-use book I 
have yet to come across. &nbsp;People are constantly asking me to recommend a 
book on the subject, and there just haven&rsquo;t been many that I have found 
particularly helpful. &nbsp;Either the pictures weren&rsquo;t clear, the text 
wasn&rsquo;t informative enough, the author was lacking real experience, or the 
book just wasn&rsquo;t laid out in a user friendly way (ok, Samuel 
Thayer&rsquo;s books are an exception to these criticisms, and are excellent 
wild food references).</p> 
<p>Ancestral Plants is different, this book just seems to have it all. 
&nbsp;Arthur writes from a place of profound understanding of the nutritional 
and medicinal actions of wild foods, as well as the important uses that these 
95 plants held for the native people of this continent (and still do for the 
&ldquo;neo-aboriginal&rdquo; today).</p> 
<p>Since I received my first copy (just a couple of weeks ago on the Winter 
Solstice) I haven&rsquo;t been able to put it down. &nbsp;Thats not hype, I 
have literally been taking it everywhere. &nbsp;This book has become part of my 
everyday kit. &nbsp;And even though it is winter here, I have been studying up 
on the plants I want to learn in the next growing season, as well as using the 
calendar in the back to determine when I will be harvesting the key plants I 
intend to use throughout the year of 2011!</p> 
<p>One of the things I really appreciate about it is that it is written as 
more than just a wild food guide, it is a plant medicine guide as well, 
detailing herbal uses of these plants in addition to their uses as foods. More 
than that, it also lays out which plants may be useful as a fire resource (for 
friction fire, tinder etc), for cordage (plants that contain fibers that can be 
removed and braided in to cord), archery uses (woods that are optimal for 
making bows or arrows), and even uses like dyes, glues, and basketry.</p> 
<p>Ancestral Plants uses a series of icons to denote the possible uses of a 
plant &nbsp;(a little fire icon for plants with fire uses, an arrow for plants 
with uses in archery, etc), and then the text details how, when, and which 
parts of a plant can be used in this way. &nbsp;The photos are very clear and 
the descriptions have been written by someone who has actually used the plants 
to the ends described therein (believe me, this is not the norm).</p> 
<p>This is <em>the</em> go-to book for understanding wild plants of the North 
East, and the one that will accompany me into the field this year and for years 
to come (mine is getting dog-eared already).</p> 
<p>Also, I want to let you know that though this book was written for plants 
of the North East, dozens of the plants here will &nbsp;be found throughout 
North America, and even beyond. &nbsp;I think that foragers of all skill level 
and in a variety of eco-ranges will benefit from this work. &nbsp;Also, this is 
an excellent resource for herbalists or those interested in herbal medicine, as 
each plants pharmacology and mode of action are broken down in a very explicit 
and comprehensible way. &nbsp;It has already become one of my most valued 
herbal references.</p> 
<p>This book was published by Anaskimin, (the Penobscot native word for 
&ldquo;acorn&rdquo;) a nonprofit organization here in Maine, who&rsquo;s 
purpose is the protection of open and wild spaces through public and private 
education. &nbsp;Not only is this book the most useful and user friendly I have 
seen on the subject, but by purchasing it you are directly supporting the 
preservation of remaining wild places in a radical new way, by educating people 
how to care for and interface with wild nature.</p> 
<p>Also, as a heads up, Arthur and I will be leading two weekend workshops 
together this year in the North East, one in May called &ldquo;Ancestral 
Plants&rdquo; and another in September called &ldquo;Ancestral Ignition&rdquo;. 
&nbsp;The first will be a three day wild food education, identifaction, 
gathering, processing, and preparation workshop! &nbsp;The second will focus on 
the creation of fire from friction, using natural materials from the landscape, 
the way it was done for the last 400,000 years. &nbsp;I am very excited about 
both of these classes, and will be posting the details shortly. &nbsp;Stay 
Tuned!</p> 
<p>Check out the video interview below to learn more about the book, and click 
here to get your copy now! You will gain tremendous knowledge and be supporting 
a wonderful and important cause.</p> 
<p>Today is the first blizzard of 2011 here in Maine, and I am off to enjoy 
the snow! &nbsp;Thanks for visiting and please let me know what you think of 
the book!</p>

<h2>Sauerkraut Fermentation At Home</h2> 
<p>For those of us who are developing or returning to our ancestral health 
through traditional and indigenous nutritional practices, few food preparation 
skills are as valuable to possess as lacto-fermentation.</p> 
<p>Imagine for a moment living without a fossil fuel driven infrastructure to 
deliver us our &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; veggies in January and an electrically 
powered refrigerator to store them in, and its importance and relevance becomes 
clear. &nbsp;Storing vegetables for the winter is a critical skill, and 
lacto-fermentation has some advantages that are hard to beat.</p> 
<p>For instance, Lacto-Fermentaion actually <em>increases</em> the amount of 
nutrition that was present in the vegetable alone (by converting sugars into 
protein rich bacterial bodies, B vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids), increase 
the bio-availability of the existing nutrition (by breaking down cell walls by 
predigesting the vegetables cellulose, and removing anti-nutrients) and all the 
while preserving the inherent nutrition better than freezing, canning, or 
drying!</p> 
<p>Lacto-fermentation, the kind of vegetable fermentation that produces foods 
like sauerkraut (as well as kimchee and brined pickles), preserves our food in 
lactic acid, and was one of the dominant preservation techniques used by our 
ancestors before sugar&nbsp;and preservatives became the norm. &nbsp;The 
primary fermentative organism present in these kinds of preserves is&nbsp;
lactobacillus acidophilus (who&rsquo;s name means &ldquo;acid loving milk 
bacteria&rdquo;) one of our bodies primary microbial&nbsp;symbionts.</p> 
<p>Not only does lactobacillus acidophilus allow us to preserve and even 
increase the amount of nutrition in our vegetables, but it also aids in 
digestion and increases our immunity too! &nbsp;Lactobacillus takes up 
residence in our small intestine, creating a kind of probiotic bio-shield in 
the gut, where it aggressively out-competes other dys-biotic organisms that can 
cause us to fall ill.</p> 
<p>Ok, so forgive me here, but I am going to interject a few definitions and a 
quick mathmatical formula. Trust me, it will help.</p> 
<p>Prebiotic + Probiotic = Synbiotic. &nbsp;Easy right? &nbsp;Here is what it 
means.</p> 
<p>The thing we intend to ferment is known as a &ldquo;prebiotic&rdquo; (I am 
using this term loosely, don&rsquo;t tell the scientists), this is the food 
source (sugars) for the organisms that will be converting the food into a 
fermented-food (in our case cabbage). &nbsp;We add to that the 
&ldquo;probiotic&rdquo; organism (these are healthy, symbiotic micro-organisms) 
that will be performing the fermentation (here it will be lactobacillus). 
&nbsp;Ok, a little caveat, we might not actually add the probiotic, but rather 
let it colonize itself, in what is called a &ldquo;wild fermentation&rdquo;, as 
is the case here with sauerkraut. &nbsp;Organisms native to the area where you 
are fermenting, or &ndash; as is the case with cabbage &ndash; are indigenous 
to the food itself. &nbsp;Through the alchemy of the fermentative process 
something new will be created, and that new thing is known as the 
&ldquo;synbiotic&rdquo;. &nbsp;I want to emphasize, the synbiotic is a new 
food, not the sum of the original parts, this is why sauerkraut is not 
&ldquo;cabbage&rdquo;, and wine is not &ldquo;grape juice&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Synbiotics like sauerkraut have long been used by those before us to 
fortify their immune systems, assist in digestion (their acidity helps to lower 
the pH of the stomach increasing the effectiveness of our hydrochloric acid), 
and to maintain healthy levels of the probiotic organisms that colonize our 
digestive lumen. &nbsp;While many people use probiotic supplements in an 
attempt to achieve these ends, most often lacto-fermented foods perform these 
tasks better, can be made at home from whole, fresh, local foods, are 
inexpensive, and add a considerable amount of quality nutrition in the form of 
highly absorbable predigested, living food. &nbsp;Oh, and they taste great too!
</p> 
<p>For me, lacto-ferments like sauerkraut are one of my primary ways of 
preserving and consuming local vegetables through out the long Maine winters. 
&nbsp;Aside from the occasional Whole Foods splurge, I don&rsquo;t suspect I 
will be eating very many fresh green vegetables until the wild spring shoots 
emerge after the thaw. &nbsp;Aside from the vegetables that keep in my cellar 
(onions, squashes, garlic) and the vegetables I have frozen (wild fiddle heads, 
japanese knotweed) lacto-ferments are my main source of &ldquo;living&rdquo; 
vegetation.</p> 
<p>If you have never made a fermentation like this at home, take heart! 
&nbsp;It is easy to do, and requires very little work or know how. &nbsp;Simply 
follow the steps in the video below, and in a couple of weeks you will have 
your first batch ready to eat!</p> 
<p>For those who would like a deeper look into the biological processes that 
take place in the fermentation of cabbage into sauerkraut, check out

<h2>Wild Fermented Hard Cider</h2> 
<p>Did you know that fermented beverages, specifically ethanol containing 
beverages were a crucial componant of most indigenous and traditional health 
strategies? &nbsp;Or that those who drink a moderate amount of ethanol live 
longer than those who drink heavily or don&rsquo;t drink at all?</p> 
<p>Of course the beverages fermented by native peoples and by our traditional 
cultural forebearers were much healthier and nutritionally viable than those of 
today, created with local ingredients and wild yeasts, and were not filtered 
and pasturized like the ones that most of us were raised around. &nbsp;Turning 
simple sugars into ethanol, amino acids, and B complex vitamins, not to mention 
a culturally and ritually significant inebriant is a nearly ubiquitous human 
behavior, and part of what holds the fabric of traditional societies together.
</p> 
<p>Earlier in the year I had the culturally enriching experience of imbibing 
some of the traditional fermented beverages of South America, specificallyChicha
 (from Maize)&nbsp;and Masatao (fromCassava), both traditional ferments of the 
people of Peru. &nbsp;These wonderful drinks were both relatively low in 
alcohol, with probably just a bit less than a modern beer, and loaded with 
nutrition and calories, making them as much a food as a drink. &nbsp;I was 
immediately impressed with the way that these were built into the nutritional 
and spiritual systems of the area. &nbsp;They were not viewed as guilt laden 
pleasures or sources of immoral behavior and debauchery,&nbsp;but rather as 
sacred and vitally health supportive. &nbsp;And while we use the term 
&ldquo;intoxicant&rdquo; to refer to drinks that contain alcohol, these people 
didn&rsquo;t associate their sacred beverages with &ldquo;toxicity&rdquo; at 
all.</p> 
<p>It was my desire to begin wild fermenting a local sugar of low to moderate 
alcohol content that could be drank unfiltered and unpasteruized. &nbsp;I 
wanted to recreate this often undiscussed and overlooked aspect of traditional 
human diets and bring it into my home and my life. While I have also been 
fermenting honey with some success (a beverage called Mead), I wanted to brew 
something with a milder effect (mead has the alcohol content of wine, upwards 
of 16 % or more) that could be done with very little labor or input, just the 
way our ancestors had done it.</p> 
<p>Through this quest I have become enamoured by Cider, which is the proper 
name for the fermented alcoholic draught made from the fresh pressed juice from 
apples. &nbsp;Today we often refer to &ldquo;Hard Cider&rdquo; as the fully 
fermented version, and &ldquo;Cider&rdquo; as the unfermented, unfiltered juice 
of apples, which is a departure from the traditional meaning. &nbsp;Cider is 
usually defined as having an alcohol content of 2 &ndash; 8.5 % or higher, 
though my experience is that it tastes great and is incredibly refreshing even 
during initial fermentation when the alcohol content is negligible like that of
Kombucha.</p> 
<p>You can imagine that prior to the widespread use of refrigeration, areas of 
the world with large apple yields would have had quite a bit of Cider on hand, 
as the juice of fresh apples ferments quite readily. Perhaps you have bought 
fresh apple juice from a local orchard before and had it begin to ferment on 
you!</p> 
<p>The apple juice I have worked with begins to ferment almost immediately 
after it reaches room temperature, and in truth gets better each and every day 
that it sits. &nbsp;The initial fermentation stage is wonderful, as the Cider 
develops its sparkling effervescence. &nbsp;I love drinking it this way 
throughout the day, and like saving the older, dryer, and &ldquo;harder&rdquo; 
Cider for the evenings with dinner and after.</p> 
<p>Fermentation can seem a bit intimidating when you haven&rsquo;t tried it 
before, and that is why I am posting this video. &nbsp;Cider is so easy to 
produce at homea cave man could do it!</p> 
<p>I hope you enjoy this two part &ldquo;Wild Fermented Hard Cider&rdquo; 
video. &nbsp;Please give us your feedback by leaving a comment below!</p> 
<p>~Daniel</p> 
<p>P.S. Your probably wondering what &ldquo;a moderate amount of 
alcohol&rdquo; is. &nbsp;Studies indicate that 1 &ndash; 3 drinks ethanol 
drinks per day seems to extend lifespans! Here is a review from the Journal of 
Clinical Epidemiology showing the effects of alcohol on life span!</p> 
<p>P.P.S. &nbsp;I understand the many detrimental effects that alcoholism and 
alcohol related accidents have had on us as individuals and as a civilization. 
&nbsp;I have personally been witness to it in my own life amongst people that I 
love dearly. &nbsp;This blog is in no way supporting reckless or irreverent use 
of ethanol. &nbsp;Alcohol consumption goes further into antiquity than can be 
accounted for, in other words it is part of the human story. &nbsp;Each one of 
us must determine how we will responsibly relate to it as a substance, and how 
we will steward it with health and safety in mind.<br>

<h2>Wild Ricing in Maine!</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>(The actual video of harvesting wild rice is at the bottom of this blog 
post!)</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I have had the opportuntiy to forage wild foods for a few years now, with 
each season yielding greater and greater amounts of food. &nbsp;No harvest yet 
has supplied me with the amount of food energy that I was able to gather this 
September when I learned the ancient art of &ldquo;Ricing&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Most of the wild plants that I have been learning to use are incredibly 
nutritious (as well as delicious) but a bit low in calories. &nbsp;Many wild 
foraged plants are eaten like vegetables (stinging nettle come to 
mind)&nbsp;but lack the energy density that we get from meats, grains, oils, 
concentrated sugars. &nbsp;This means that as a forager I am still largely 
dependent on my local agricultural system to provide me with calories that I 
need to live out my daily life.</p> 
<p>Wild rice however, is a complex carbohydrate (macro-nutrient), and unlike 
the mono-cropped and refined carbohydrates of the average American diet, is a 
rich whole food grain loaded with vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) as 
well.</p> 
<p>Today, most of the worlds citizens are living with an inverse relationship 
between micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc) and macronutrients (calories). 
&nbsp;We have become overfed and under nourished. Our ancestors ate extremely 
micronutrient dense diets when compared against our own. &nbsp;Their constant 
quest instead was securing the macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein 
calories) that they required for their huge daily energy expenditures.</p> 
<p>Of course today it is nearly the opposite, where most of the (over) 
developed world has calorie rich diet composed of overly processed and refined 
food &ndash; think white sugar, white flour, high fructose corn syrup, etc 
&ndash; that is deeply lacking in micro-nutrition. &nbsp;Most Americans are 
deficient in micronutrients even to the RDA standard (recommended daily 
allowances of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences) which is surprisingly low 
when compared against the nutrient intakes of so called &ldquo;primitive 
peoples&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Now that I am moving away from &ldquo;novelty foraging&rdquo; toward a 
subsistence that includes Wild Foods, I am acutely aware of this nutritional 
crux. &nbsp;There are plenty of micronutrients in the foods that I forage from 
my ecosystem, but most of my actual caloric needs still come from my local farm.
</p> 
<p>That is all changing for me now that I have learned to forage a few key 
items, perhaps the greatest and most important, of which is Wild Rice.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Zizania palustris</em></strong> is an aquatic grain occurring 
widely throughout the Eastern United States (like Maine where I live) and 
Canada. &nbsp;It inhabits the shallow waters of lakes, ponds, and slow moving 
rivers. &nbsp;There is a long and rich historical record of its harvest by 
native peoples of this continent and is to this day still harvested by existing 
native populations of North America, and in particular the Great Lakes region.
</p> 
<p>Though today much of the Wild Rice sold in the market place is cultivated 
in rice paddies, this highly nutritious grain is still available to the forager 
for the price of his or her labor.</p> 
<p>Before trying truly wild rice, I was familiar only with the store bought, 
paddy cultivated wild rice which, though wonderful in flavor and rich in 
nutrition, just simply pales in comparison. &nbsp;Hand harvested, sundried, 
fire parched, foot treaded, and wind winnowed wild rice is so soft and delicate 
in flavor that it simply has to be tasted to be understood. &nbsp;The softness 
is like that of the most perfectly cooked white rice but with all the 
nutritious nutty flavors of a wild intact grain. &nbsp;This is because of a 
curing process used with commercially prepared &ldquo;wild rice&rdquo; that 
causes the grains to become very hard and locks in some of the unpleasantly 
strong flavors.</p> 
<p>In contrast to many wild foraged plants, wild rice requires a more 
considerable amount of know how and equipment to locate, access, harvest, and 
process, so to show this in its entirety is simply outside the scope of a blog 
post. &nbsp;Instead I have prepared this short video to highlight the 
experiences I had ricing this season.</p> 
<p>I am hoping that in the future some of you will have the opportunity to 
come to Maine to learn the art in person.</p> 
<p>What a wonderful feeling to know that this winter I will be eating more of 
my calories from foods that were sustainably harvested from my local landscape.
</p> 
<p>I am grateful to the abundant Earth.</p> 
<p>~Daniel</p> 
<p>PS, check out this podcast I recently did where we discuss the history of 
grains and agriculture, as well as some must have information on making the 
grains you use a safe and healthy food!</p>

<h2>Nettle Root Tincturing and Male Health</h2> 
<p>This video below is part 2 of the&nbsp;Stinging Nettle Root harvesting 
video that I put up a couple of weeks back.</p> 
<p>You can see that video here.</p> 
<p>I put this up to demonstrate how simple it is to produce your own wild 
nettle root tincture for use as an herbal medicine.</p> 
<p>Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica) is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant 
known by many of us for the painful stinging hairs (they are actually called 
&ldquo;trichomes&rdquo;) that inject histamine into our skin like micro 
hypodermic needles.</p> 
<p>Despite this, and even because of it, Nettle has been used as food and 
medicine by many cultures and is an important species for those of us who 
practice foraging, herbalism, or primitive outdoor skills.</p> 
<p>While the aerial parts of the plant (the parts that grow above the ground) 
are most commonly eaten as a pot herb (cooked) or made into infusions (teas), 
it is the roots from which we can extract its potent androgenic substances. 
&nbsp;If you are woman reading this pay close attention. &nbsp;While you may 
not need Nettle root as a medicine for yourself, its highly likely you know a 
man who does. &nbsp;Be sure to read &nbsp;on.</p> 
<p>Nettle root supports male health in a few different ways. &nbsp;There is a 
globulin in human blood calledSex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) which binds 
to testosterone, rendering it unavailable to the our cells. &nbsp;Nettle root 
contains compunds that bind to SHBG taking the place of testosterone and 
thereby keeping free testosterone in the blood.</p> 
<p>More than this, it also prevents the conversion of testosterone into a 
metabolite known as dihydrotestosterone, which has been implicated in benign 
prostate hyperplasia and even male pattern baldness.</p> 
<p>If this wasn&rsquo;t enough, phyto-chemicals in Nettle root further work to 
prevent Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) by stopping the binding of DHT to the 
prostate membrane.</p> 
<p>Since the prostrate is the endocrine gland thats responsible for male 
orgasm, taking care of it for a lifetime is probably a good idea!</p> 
<p>Nettle Root is an herbal ally that seems almost designed to ensure the good 
health of a mans reproductive system into longevity (wives and girlfriends may 
want to take note).</p> 
<p>Making your own Nettle Root tinctures at home can be easy, and only takes 
few minutes.</p> 
<p>I encourage you to give it a try, and to get out into your local ecosystem 
to commune with your landscape. &nbsp;This is truest expression of 
environmentalism I can think of!</p>

<h2>Important New Chaga Foraging Update!!!</h2> 
<p>Welcome Friends, Foodies, and Foragers!</p> 
<p>For the last several years I have talked more about Chaga (Inonotus 
obliquus) than any other wild foraged food or medicine.</p> 
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, Chaga is a fungal&nbsp;sclerotium with 
notable anti-cancer &nbsp;terpines (such as betulinic acid) and immune system 
modulating sugars (called beta glucans). &nbsp;More than any other medicinal 
mushroom, this has been my number one herbal/fungal ally. &nbsp;In fact, for 
much of the year I use it almost daily and have for several years now&hellip;
</p> 
<p>Chaga is normally decocted (boiled in water to produce a broth or tea) for 
about two hours, yielding a very mild vanilla like flavor (it containsvanillin 
as one of its components) which is great to drink on its own, with added cream 
and a sweetener (I like maple syrup) to create a drink much like coffee. 
&nbsp;It is also an excellentblended drink or soup base.</p> 
<p>This video post is about peeling Chaga, which is its traditional 
preparation method in Siberia (it is from their folk medicine that we have 
learned of Chaga). &nbsp;For years I used this fungus without peeling it, which 
yeilded wonderful results, but now that I have included the traditional 
preperation method, it would be difficult to depart from. &nbsp;De-barking 
Chaga yields a far more mild, pleasant tasting, less medicinal and more tonic 
tea.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There are of course wonderful uses for Chaga with its bark on as well, 
particularly as an anti-neoplastic medicine. &nbsp;Still for my daily use this 
is now my preferred method.</p> 
<p>Here is another video from my archive showing how to identify and harvest 
Chaga if you are interested in trying this yourself. &nbsp;If you are looking 
for a premier Chaga extract you can find it at my company,SurThrival.</p> 
<p>Thanks for watching and I can&rsquo;t wait to hear your results!</p>

<h2>Wild Foods and Medicines! Harvesting Nettle Rhizomes</h2> 
<p>Greetings Everyone!</p> 
<p>What an amazing Autumn it has been!</p> 
<p>This has been, by far, my most prolific year of harvesting wild food and 
medicine. &nbsp;While I know it is an ambitious goal, it is my personal desire 
to hunt and gather. &nbsp;Spending time withArthur Haines has propelled my wild 
nutrition path forward in ways I am so grateful for. &nbsp;In this video Arthur 
and I go into the wilds in search of wild stinging nettle roots for our 
personal homemade medicine stashes!</p> 
<p>Now that I am just weeks away from SurThrival&rsquo;s launch of its new 
Pine Pollen extracts, I wanted to share a video that is yet one more piece of 
my natural hormone maintnance strategy.</p> 
<p>I hope this motivates you to get out and harvest some food or medicine for 
yourself. &nbsp;Stay tuned for events that Arthur and I will be putting on 
where you can learn to harvest your own foods and medicines!</p> 
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to check out the mead making workshop that I have 
coming up next week. &nbsp;You can see the detailshere.</p>

<h2>Eden Hot Springs! October 6th-10th, 2010</h2> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Epic Eden Hot Springs Retreat!  October 6th through the 10th, 2010
</strong></p> 
<p>This is by far the most exciting event of the year for me! There is no 
other place on Earth that leaves me feeling so connected to the Land and to the 
Elements!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>For many years now I have visited this oasis of the Sonoran desert, and it 
has been(by far) the most trans-formative location of my life.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Up until now these retreats have been a collaborative effort of my teachers 
and mentorsDavid Wolfe and Kerri &ldquo;Dancing Butterfly&rdquo; .&nbsp; They 
have facilitated the transformation ofthe countless people who have attended 
(myself included!). </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This is in fact where my very first YouTube video was recorded, and the 
place where I began my career.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Now a new generation is taking up the call of stewarding this unique piece 
of Earth. Joy Light and RebeccaAstara are putting on this year&rsquo;s event, 
Epic Eden HotSprings! I will be leading a tour of the Sacred grounds of Eden, 
visiting along the tour the six geo-thermal hot springs that spot the land. I 
am honored to share my knowledge and experience of my many years of visiting 
this land, with all of the retreaters!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This Oasis is beyond description, but let me attempt!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When standing on the hill, the high point of the property, surrounded by 
the 360 degrees of Arizona Mountains, looking down at the valley, the magick of 
this place becomes clear. TheSonoran desert is one of the harshest, driest 
environments on the planet. Yet, this oasis isgreen and lush, surrounded by 
inhospitablegravel-strewn desert.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It all begins with a small pool known as &ldquo;The Source&rdquo;. This 
sacred spring spills over and runs into the &ldquo;Guitar Pool&rdquo;, which 
is, as you may have guessed, shaped like a guitar! It is also known as the 
&ldquo;Goddess Pool&rdquo;, because the pool imitates the curvy shape of a 
Woman&rsquo;s body. This is my favorite pool for soaking, as it is the quietest 
and most&hellip;sanctified.&nbsp; All around it salt crystals grow right up out 
of the ground, dusting the area like a fresh snow!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This water runs down past a pool known as the &ldquo;Emerald Pool&rdquo; 
which is much hotter than the guitar pool. This pool is brilliantly green with 
exotic flora, and feeds down into the most popular pool, 
&ldquo;Geronimo&rdquo;!&nbsp; This pool is named after the Apache Warrior who 
led the final free indigenous natives in the war against the early US! </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>And yes, he and his warriors really used this spring for healing and 
rejuvenation!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It is his, and the Apache spirit that is felt so strongly here!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This pool feeds down into the &ldquo;Goddess Pool&rdquo;, a hot spring pool 
the size of an Olympic swimming pool!&nbsp; Swimming, bathing, or even just 
floating here is a truly unique and indescribable experience! It is less hot 
and more like tepid bathwater&hellip; I enjoy this pool for exercise and play!
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This will be a time of powerful healing and lifelong transformation for all 
who attend.There will be many amazing work/play shop facilitators, body 
workers, and many newand old friends&hellip; Morning Yoga, Sun Gazing, Spring 
Water&hellip;. It is a chance to immerse yourself in the Temple of the 
Elemental!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Oh, and did I mention the food? The wonderful Chocolatree Cafe, based out 
of Sedona,will be preparing the food and overseeing the kitchen! Business 
partners Jen Warr of Chocolatree Cafe and Kelly Johnson of Sedona Superfoods, 
in combination come together to provide for us at the retreat this fall. They 
are a business of high integrity, bringing us the most top notch organic 
vegetarian cuisine! Each meal they serve up is delicious, nutritious, and 
uniquely prepared. Their cafe in Sedona is definitely the hot spot of the area 
and is a must visit while going through that town!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The experience of Eden is always hot, sunny, fiery energy&hellip; Burning 
off the old to make room for the new. The springs are so deeply nourishing, and 
there is always a view of the stars like few have ever seen. Soaking in these 
waters in the cold desert night looking deep into space is a gift that few ever 
give themselves!</p> 
<p>Visit <strong><em>here</em></strong> to find out more about the retreat, and
<strong><em>here</em></strong> to learn about all of the amazing facilitators 
for this epic retreat!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>For me it is a place where I shed yet another layer of domestication and 
re-member what it means to behuman.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>And so my Road takes me West&hellip;.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>You coming?</p>

<h2>The Botany of Desire!</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you are anything like me, you consume enough books that they could be 
considered part of your diet! Each book is like a tile, great or small, in the 
mosaic of world-view that we are each assembling.</p> 
<p>There is such a joy and satisfaction for me when I discover a critical 
piece of information that answers questions that I have long held.</p> 
<p>And while I love reading, sometimes I get even more (I must admit) out of 
watching a well crafted video.</p> 
<p>One example is the PBS documentary &ldquo;The Botany of Desire &rdquo; with 
Michael Pollan.</p> 
<p>I first came across the work of Michael Pollan when I read (ok, it was an 
audio book) &ldquo;In Defense of Food&rdquo;. His grounded and well researched 
teachings on nutrition and the environmental and psychological impacts of our 
diets have earned him tremendous respect as and author and authority on the 
subject (he&rsquo;s a professor of journalism at the University of California, 
Berkeley).</p> 
<p>My personal approach to nutrition has indeed been influenced by his 
writings, and most influential of all was the documentary &ldquo;The Botany of 
Desire&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some video extras from the documentary, and 
the rest is available for purchase or download online.</p> 
<p>The theme of lectures I have been giving around the continent this year has 
been &ldquo;Indigenous Nutrition and Human Evolution&rdquo;, and much of the 
focus has been on the breeding of our modern food supply.</p> 
<p>In my own life I have been pursuing a diet made up of (as much as I can) 
local, heirloom, and wild species. This has proven an interesting and valuable 
endeavor, and I am constantly amazed to discover the source of the foods that I 
grew up on. &nbsp;More on this in later blogs.</p> 
<p>So much of the The Botany of Desire: A Plant&rsquo;s-Eye View of the World 
is focused on breeding, and more specifically the breeding of four plants; 
apples, potatoes, tulips, and cannabis! &nbsp;While each section is amazing, I 
was most taken by the segment on the apple.</p> 
<p>For instance, did you know that all of the apples in our modern diet are 
genetic clones? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s true, the apple tree as we think of it is a 
grafted plant, and its fruit is exceptionally hybridized. This is so strange 
because we tend to, as a culture, consider the apple the very symbol of 
&ldquo;natural food&rdquo;. Not so! In fact the modern apple scarcely resembles 
the true wild apple in taste, size, or nutritional profile.</p> 
<p>As an example, most of us find the idea of cloning sheep or humans strange. 
Many of us, in fact, might even have a moral&nbsp;repulsion to the idea. And 
yet so much of the fruits we eat are cloned, and few of us are even aware. 
&nbsp;This is why my teachings have been focusing in on foods that are bred 
wisely, or when possible, are wild!</p> 
<p>PS;&nbsp;more interesting still is the history of the real life character 
Johnny Apple Seed. This strangely clad and barefoot historical figure was 
committed to much more than just growing apples. &nbsp;He was committed to 
planting apples from seed. &nbsp;As strange as it may seem this was and still 
is a revolutionary concept! &nbsp;Did you know that every seed in an apple 
(there are 5) will bring forth a different type of apple tree? &nbsp;It is this 
unpredictability that has led to its cloning!</p>

<h2>Wilbur Spring Update!</h2> 
<h3>In the recent video post we made about Wilbur Hot Spring, I showed a 
spring that appears to be bringing up petroleum oil!</h3> 
<p>No one there was able to explain this to me, and I was looking for some 
confirmation&hellip;.</p> 
<p>Special thanks to Lin for getting me this information!  It is an old 
document describing the Wilbur Spring and surrounding area. &nbsp;The bottom of 
the first paragraph makes reference to &ldquo;Oil Spring&rdquo; which tastes of 
petroleum! &nbsp;That gives a bit of confirmation.</p> 
<p>Then there was also this document which mentions springs of petroleum 
coming up in the area&hellip;</p> 
<p>Now to see if the Balneologists know of any theraputic benefit to this 
naturally occuring compound! &nbsp;Compounds like Radon and Arsenic, which are 
known to be poisonous are considered to have beneficial medicinal action in the 
art and science of balneotherapy. &nbsp;Dose is everything!</p> 
<p>My first reaction to seeing petroleum in the spring was notable concern. 
&nbsp;As I began to contemplate this, I realized i didn&rsquo;t have a 
reference point for naturally occurring &ldquo;rock oil&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>If anyone finds a reference or more information on this, please leave it as 
a comment below!!</p> 
<p>Deep Gratitude!</p>

<p>Post Script! &nbsp;It is now April 5th, 2010, and this was just received 
from Wilbur HotSprings!</p> 
<pre>Dear Friends: Some of you have expressed interest in the black tar like 
substance that Daniel Vitalis showed in his excellent, and, for me, emotionally 
moving, 2 movie UTube series on Wilbur Hot Springs. Here is some information on 
that healing smelly substance. A black, tar like, material can be seen in the 
mud around the Wilbur Hot Springs source springs. You cannot see this black 
material in the hot water since it is dissolved; however, you can smell a very 
mild petroleum like odor in Wilbur's medicinal mineral water along with the 
smell of sulfur, a well known, and established, anti bacterial agent. I have 
witnessed dramatic reductions in the symptoms of Psoriasis at Wilbur Hot 
Springs. My research led me to the following article from the renowned Mayo 
Clinic. Treatments and drugs By Mayo Clinic staff &lt;
http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/AboutThisSite/AM00057&gt; Psoriasis treatments 
aim to: - Interrupt the cycle that causes an increased production of skin 
cells, thereby reducing inflammation and plaque formation. - Remove scale and 
smooth the skin, which is particularly true of topical treatments that you 
apply to your skin. *Topical treatments* Used alone, creams and ointments that 
you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis. - 
*Coal tar. A thick, black byproduct of the manufacture of petroleum products 
and coal, coal tar is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. It reduces 
scaling, itching and inflammation. Exactly how it works isn't known. Coal tar 
has few known side effects, but it's messy, stains clothing and bedding, and 
has a strong odor. Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams 
and oils.* In addition, Daniel Vitalis personally assimilated the depth of the 
respectful and non cult atmosphere that we have created at Wilbur. He is to be 
commended, and thanked, for his making Wilbur a subject of his professional, 
guerrilla, video journalism. Richard Richard Louis Miller, M.A., Ph.D. Wilbur 
Caretaker in Chief since 1972</pre>

<h2>Bodybuilding Wild Chaga Protein Elixir</h2> 
<h3><em>Hey Everyone! This is Sarah Maria and I&rsquo;m really excited to have 
the opportunity to create this blog post today!</em></h3> 
<p>Daniel and I didn&rsquo;t want to leave you hanging for long without new 
information posted on the site but Daniel is unable to devote any time to his 
blog for a little while yet as he is on the road and busy spreading the word of
Shamanic Nutrition in California! The tour is going great and there are several 
events left if your thinking you&rsquo;d like to see Daniel do his thing live 
and in person!</p> 
<h4>These next 3 videos are the follow up from the last post entitled 
&ldquo;Stalking the Wild Chaga&rdquo;.</h4> 
<p>The first video covers proper drying and storage of the Chaga mushroom and 
preparing a decoction, with the 2nd &amp; 3rd videos being a detailed, step by 
step instruction on creating an Elixir, using the wild-harvested Chaga tea as a 
base.</p> 
<h4><em>As per usual, Daniel&rsquo;s delivery in these next 3 videos is 
flawless&hellip; Enjoy!</em></h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>Daniel has a bit of an aversion to recipes&hellip;.. preferring to teach 
the principles and process of ElixirCrafting and encouraging people to use 
their intuition and to create from their own unique palate, so it&rsquo;s a 
special treat that he measured everything this time and I was able to put 
together the recipe for you!</p> 
<p><em><strong>I&rsquo;ll let you watch the videos first though&hellip; the 
recipe is included at the bottom of the post.</strong></em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The ElixirCraft Mastery Program is an excellent resource for understanding 
the concept and components of making liquid medicinal preparations and I 
recommend it to anyone who is embarking on the journey to Invincible Health!</p>
<p>Also, check out our friends at rawnatureboy.com to get an exclusive package 
deal on Sun Warrior Protein Powder, SurThrival Colostrum &amp; Immortal Velvet 
Deer Antler!!!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For those of us living in areas where Chaga is not readily available we can 
substitute the Chaga tea base with any medicinal teas we are currently working 
with, keeping in mind that the flavor may vary slightly&hellip; but not enough 
to make that big of a difference.</p> 
<h3>Bodybuilding Wild Chaga Protein Elixir</h3> 
<p>6 cups wild chaga decoction (tea)<br>
 1/2 cup soaked chia seeds<br>
 1/4 
cup mesquite powder<br>
 1 cup wild blueberries<br>
 3 raw eggs<br>
 1/2 cup 
Sun Warrior protein powder<br>
 1/2 cup SurThrival colostrum<br>
 1tblsp raw 
butter (or other fat source)<br>
 3 guarana seeds<br>

<h2>You Can Harvest Wild Rice!</h2> 
<h3><em>Ever wonder where Wild Rice comes from?</em></h3> 
<p><em><br>
</em></p> 
<p>These are the final two videos from the series I shot with Arthur Haines, 
Botonist and Wild Foods Expert and Primitive Skills Master! When he wants to 
eat Wild Rice he doesn&rsquo;t go to the market or health food store, he goes 
to into the Wilds!</p> 
<p>For much of the year Wild Rice has formed a significant part of my diet and 
I recommend it to my friends and clients often as a commercially available 
source of Wild Food! &nbsp;For countless generations it served as a staple food 
crop to many indigenous peoples of North America.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Arthur and his crew harvest enough each season to last them through the 
year, and they process all of it by hand! &nbsp;This is more than interesting, 
it is an education in how you can get started too!</p> 
<p>Special thanks to both Arthur and the Maine Primitive Skills School for 
introducing me to him! &nbsp;I will be taking part in a 3 day course this 
weekend with them on Winter Survival Skills, and I will be sure to get lots of 
great footage!</p> 
<h3><em>Also, there are just a few days left to grab your discounted tickets to
Eden Hot Springs (seriously)! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t miss this chance to soak in 
these Wild Waters!</em></h3> 
<h3><em></em>And, if you love Arthur let him know by leaving your comments! 
&nbsp;If all goes well we will offer a foraging class sometime this summer!</h3>
<p><em><strong>Thank You for reading this and for all your support! This is 
for you! ~Daniel</strong></em></p>

<h2>An official challenge to those who love Kombucha!</h2> 
<h3><em>Thanks for checking back!</em></h3> 
<p>We are excited to bring yet another video with Wild Foods expert Arthur 
Haines!</p> 
<p>This information, for me, was particularly fascinating, and I think the 
same is true for Arthur as well!</p> 
<p>For centuries people have been enjoying the health benefits of the 
fermented beverage Kombucha, which is often mistakenly referred to a Chinese 
Mushroom Tea. &nbsp;In truth, Kombucha, which most likely hails not from China, 
but from Russia, is tea that has been fermented by a &ldquo;SCOBY&rdquo;. 
&nbsp;This is an acronym for a Symbiotic Colony Of Yeast and Bacteria, the
strange pancake like colony of organisms that float on top of the ferment.</p> 
<p>Typically the Kombucha begins with a steeped tea (literally the Tea plant 
&ldquo;Camellia sinensis&rdquo;) and white or &ldquo;unrefined&rdquo; 
&nbsp;cane sugar. &nbsp;The SCOBY, often called the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; is 
placed into the tea where it (the yeast and bacteria) ferment the feed on the 
sugars and phytonutrients of the tea, fermenting it into the drink we call 
Kombucha.</p> 
<p>For years I have been told that the Mother required the caffeine from the 
tea plant, as well as the Sucrose from the sugar. &nbsp;I have seen small 
Kombucha projects where honey, agave, and other alternative sugar sources have 
been used, but they ultimately are less functional than sucrose. &nbsp;The 
flavored and herbed Kombucha we see on the market is made first with tea, and 
then is infused with other plants after it is fermented.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Arthur has discovered a method that bypasses both the Tea plant 
as well as the Refined Sugar!</em><em> </em><em>What he shares here is a truly 
Wild food, fully medicinal, and even better tasting than what I was used to!
</em></strong></p> 
<p>So, this is an official challenge to the Kombucha producers and communities 
to up their game!</p> 
<p>Have a look and let us know what you think!!! ~Daniel</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Oh, almost forgot! &nbsp;Special thanks to Lauren Kinsey, who posted a 
really valuable comment after seeing the last set of videos with Arthur. 
&nbsp;I had mentioned that wild plant harvesting by humans can actually benefit 
the ecosystem. &nbsp;In a portion of her response Lauren&rsquo;s says &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t understand how harvesting wild food can &ldquo;benefit the 
ecosystem&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>I really appreciated her stepping up to ask because I know that I (and much 
of my generation) was raised to believe that we are inherently, by our very 
nature, damaging to ecosystems. &nbsp;This way of seeing the world is very much 
in vogue today. &nbsp;Arthur shares a very eloquent response;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It does at first seem like an odd statement that collecting wild 
plants can actually benefit the ecosystem. But Daniel&rsquo;s statement is 
factual. It may be hard to perceive because we simply don&rsquo;t interact with 
wild plants as traditional cultures did, which means we lack the knowledge base 
to understand our role in the ecology of these organisms. Further, we have been 
taught to &ldquo;take only pictures, leave only footprints.&rdquo; This 
well-intentioned phrase has created a populace that no longer uses and 
cherishes wild species. Consequently, many do not understand their true value.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>There are so many examples of beneficial human interaction it is hard to 
know where to begin. Consider species such as evening-primrose, a colonizer of 
open, disturbed places that has an edible taproot. When we gather this root, we 
kill the plant. However, we also till the ground when we excavate the roots, 
disturbing the soil and maintaining an open area&ndash;which is absolutely 
necessary for this species. Without repeated disturbance, the area will 
eventually grow in with taller plants that will shade out the evening-primrose, 
leading to a loss of that species at that site. When we gather edible seeds and 
seed-like fruits, we unintentionally scatter or drop some of them, helping the 
plant to disperse further than it would have otherwise. Native American 
practices have been shown to increase the abundance of certain species even 
though lethal collection was being performed. They utilized many traditional 
practices to ensure plants were not eradicated. Simply gathering bulbs after 
the seeds had formed would allow the plant to germinate in freshly tilled earth.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>We really do need a shift away from the current paradigm of a hands-off 
approach to nature. This &ldquo;look but don&rsquo;t touch&rdquo; attitude 
toward nature has been applied too extensively, and many mistakenly believe 
that all wild beings are better off without any human interaction. However, 
there exist many examples showing that conscientious use of plants by people is 
beneficial for those species. Further, experientially learning the uses of wild 
plants teaches people to value those species while also helping them to become 
more self-sufficient.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The simultaneous use and conservation of nature requires far more knowledge 
and skill than simply leaving nature alone. What might appear on the surface to 
be a wanton act of collection actually represents a gathering system that 
includes numerous safeguards to protect plants from overharvest. Abstract 
learning about nature (i.e., learning that doesn&rsquo;t involve interaction 
and use) doesn&rsquo;t accurately portray the value of different species. 
Without this knowledge, the need to preserve species can&rsquo;t be fully 
appreciated.</p> 
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Arthur Haines</p>
