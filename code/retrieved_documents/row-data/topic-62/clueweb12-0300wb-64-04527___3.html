<p>Contain It: Ten Things to Think about when Growing Container Roses<br>
<br>

 If your space is at a premium, but you love roses, you may want to think about 
growing container roses.<br>
<br>
 1. Convenience of Location<br>
<br>
 Growing 
roses in containers had a lot of advantages. If you don't have a yard to garden 
in, or are limited to a balcony on your apartment, container gardening is 
perfect. Containers can be set on a patio or moved about as needed to give you 
the most decorative effect you can get. As long as you are gentle, it is fairly 
easy to move container roses. Larger containers can get quite heavy after they 
are filled up with plants and soil. If you are planting a large container, put 
it where you want it to sit before you begin to fill it. If you put it on a 
rolling stand, it is easier to move the container later or rotate it to get 
even sun exposure.<br>
<br>
 When choosing a spot for your container rose, 
remember your rose needs six hours of direct sun every day. You'll also want to 
keep in mind how easy it is to water your rose in your chosen location, and 
what kind of temperatures will your rose be exposed to in its container.<br>

<br> 2. What Roses to Plant<br>
<br>
 Be aware that not every rose is going to 
adapt to growing in a container. Do some research on what varieties will grow 
well in a small space. Ask at your local garden center. They should be able to 
recommend many varieties that will be suitable.<br>
<br>
 3. Size of Your 
Container<br>
<br>
 Plants are usually planted closer together in containers 
than they are in the ground. Be sure to leave enough room in the container for 
your rose to grow. It needs room for root growth and space for good air 
circulation. Many beginners to container planting make the mistake of planting 
their roses in containers that are really too small. They end up repotting 
quickly as the roses outgrow the original pot.<br>
<br>
 4. Type of Containers
<br> <br>
 There are a lot of different containers to choose from for your 
roses. While most roses come in perfectly usable plastic pots, remember that 
black and other dark colored plastic containers will absorb heat and dry out 
the soil much more quickly than lighter colored pots. Ceramic and wooden pots 
are also good choices. You can find decorative terra cotta pots at many garden 
centers, but they lose water more quickly than some other types of pots. Be 
sure you choose one that is practical as well as decorative. Consider the size 
of your rose, the color and the surroundings in which it will sit when choosing 
your pot.<br>
<br>
 5. Drainage<br>
<br>
 Be sure the container you select has 
good drainage. No matter how pretty a pot is, if it doesn't have enough holes 
for the excess water to flow through, your rose will not thrive.<br>
<br>
 6. 
Soil Mixture<br>
<br>
 It is essential to provide a high quality soil mix. You 
can find a perfect pre-mixed soil at your garden center, or you can mix your 
own with compost and top soil.<br>
<br>
 7. Watering<br>
<br>
 Be sure you 
don't overwater your rose. Underwatering it can be just as disastrous. Remember 
that water will drain out much faster from a pot than it does in the ground. If 
you have roses in hanging baskets, they will need to be watered much more 
frequently than other kinds of containers. Hanging baskets lose a lot more 
water than other containers. Try not to get a lot of extra water on the leaves 
of your rose.<br>
<br>
 8. Feeding<br>
<br>
 Dilute the food you feed your 
container roses. You may need to feed more often since the water draining from 
the bottom of the pot will carry fertilizer with it.<br>
<br>
 9. Grooming and 
Pruning Your Roses<br>
<br>
 Always inspect your roses for signs of pests and 
disease. This is extremely important if your roses are located inside. Remove 
all old blossoms and prune out the old canes.<br>
<br>
 10. Watch the 
Temperature<br>
<br>
 It makes sense that a rose in a container is going to be 
more sensitive to heat and cold than if it were planted in the ground. Give 
them a little extra care and they will continue to thrive. Protect them from 
freezing by bringing them into a protected area or bring them indoors for the 
winter.</p>
