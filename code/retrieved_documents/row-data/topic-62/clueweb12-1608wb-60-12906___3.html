<br> 
<p>To be honest, container gardens are more work than in-ground gardens, the 
exception being potted succulents, like my sedum collection that happily bakes 
in the sun with no supplemental watering.&nbsp; But sometimes we grow plants<i>
despite</i> the trouble they cause us because we love them, or maybe because 
balcony or rooftop gardening is our only option.</p> 
<p>Containers are also great when our soil is horrible for planting. And 
containers are portable, so we can move plants around the garden or even 
indoors for the winter, especially with the help of plant dollies.</p> 
<h2>The Container</h2> 
<p>Types are detailed below but there&rsquo;s one thing they all have in 
common: the bigger, the better for the health of the plants. Sources recommend 
containers that are as wide as they are tall for stability and for good 
insulation of roots.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Plastic pots are inexpensive and are slow to dry out, which is an 
advantage with most plants, but a disadvantage for plants that need &ldquo;good 
drainage&rdquo; &mdash; like lavender or these sedums. And definitely on the 
negative side, the<i>y look cheap.</i></li> 
<li>Terra cotta pots look better, but are a lot heavier, and most won&rsquo;t 
withstand the freeze-and-thaw cycles of winter. They clearly provide better 
drainage than plastic, though.</li> 
<li>Glazed ceramic pots look great but need more drainage holes, and again if 
you live where winters include freezing temps, make sure they&rsquo;re hardy 
before you buy it, unless you&rsquo;ll be bringing them indoors.</li> 
<li>Cheap wood can and will rot; redwood and cedar will last longer. There are 
concerns about wooden containers that have been treated &mdash; fear that the 
vapors can damage plants, andhere&rsquo;s some information about treated wood 
and plants.</li> 
<li>These days a very popular alternative are the lightweight fiberglass and 
resin planters that mimic real stone, terra cotta, or concrete. In the photo 
above, most of the planters are fiberglass and they cost about $60 each.</li> 
<li>Hanging baskets are often lined with sphagnum moss to better hold water. 
Still, it&rsquo;s hard to water often enough if the basket is hung in the hot 
afternoon sun. Hanging plants require a<i>special</i> commitment on the part of 
their caretaker.</li> </ul> 
<p>Landscape Designer Michelle Derviss suggests choosing containers that match 
the color or style of the house.</p> 
<h2>Design</h2> 
<p>On GardenRant Elizabeth asked the design question: To mix plants within one 
pot or not? and got some great responses. The debate is between plantings of 
mixed plants or filling each pot with lots of only one particular plant.</p> 
<p>Ginny Stibolt suggests choosing plants for three levels: &ldquo;the tall or 
spiky plant, the bushy medium height plant, and the vining or trailing plant 
that will hang gracefully from the sides. Work with odd numbers of plants, and 
maybe add a nice rock or art object to enhance the arrangement. You can 
accomplish these arrangements in one large, stand-alone container or by using 
several containers of different sorts with a variety of plants. Mostly 
I&rsquo;ve had better luck with single species pots.&rdquo; This three-layer 
idea is practically universal (certainly in Japanese flower arranging) and Fine 
Gardening Magazine coined the terms &ldquo;Thrillers, Spillers and 
Fillers&rdquo; for them.</p> 
<p>Don Engebretson, the Renegade Gardener, writes: &ldquo;Plants grown in pots 
and other containers open up a whole new dimension of design possibilities. One 
of the best gardeners I know plants coleus in12&Prime;-tall pots in the spring, 
then places the pots strategically throughout one of her numerous flower beds. 
By July the perennials and annuals rising from the earth completely hide the 
pots; all one sees are these great plumes of coleus bursting up 18&Prime; to 
20&Prime; above the ground and one thinks, wow, can she ever grow coleus!&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Don recommends just one pot of flowers or cluster of pots to one side of 
the front door rather than pots evenly matched on both sides. And he likes 
oddness: &ldquo;The odd-numbered arrangement will always look better than two 
or four or six pots together. No one knows why.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>The Potting Medium</h2> 
<p>These days, soil-less potting &ldquo;media&rdquo; are popular &mdash; all 
bagged up at the hardware store or garden center. ButGinny thinks they&rsquo;re 
fine for annuals but for potted-up plants that will be staying in place longer 
than a year she recommends &ldquo;adding some compost in the soil mix and as an 
occasional topdressing because all those good microbes create a better 
environment for the roots.&rdquo; She uses half compost and half sandy soil for 
her pots, with a sterile potting medium only for the top two inches and mulch 
on top of that to prevent weeds. Sounds good to me.</p> 
<p>Those soil-less mixtures have the advantage of being lightweight, 
well-draining and disease-free, but DO need all their nutrients provided by 
you, don&rsquo;t forget. In any event, don&rsquo;t use regular garden soil 
&mdash; it&rsquo;s heavy, not as freely draining (which is of supreme 
importance in containers) and it may come with pests.</p> 
<p>Now what about using those <b>&ldquo;water-saving crystals&rdquo; or 
hydrogels</b> we see in the stores? Well, garden writers discussed this at 
length via email and one of them summed it up nicelyhere on her blog. The 
bottom line? &ldquo;Just say no&rdquo; to them.</p> 
<h2>What about covering the drainage hole?</h2> 
<p>It&rsquo;s practically gardening tradition to cover drainage holes with 
broken terra cotta chards or an inch of gravel, but respected horticultural 
authorityLinda Chalker-Scott says studies have shown that the practice actually 
<i>impedes</i> drainage - because water does not travel well from the potting 
mix to the coarse gravel mixture. Plus, plant roots need all the soil they can 
get.</p> 
<p>To prevent soil from washing out of the drainage holes, place a piece of 
weed barrier cloth, or even a few dried leaves or several layers of newspaper 
over the holes before adding the soil.Ginny again suggests using &ldquo;a large 
piece of the non-woven weed barrier cloth so it extends up the sides of the 
pot, it can also discourage ants from using your outdoor pots for nests.&rdquo;
</p> 
<h2>Planting</h2> 
<p>Fill the container with the growing medium to within one inch from the rim 
&mdash; to leave room for watering without water spilling over the side. Then 
give it a good soaking before planting. Insert plants so they meet the soil 
again about an inch from the pot&rsquo;s rim and add or remove soil so that the 
soil surface is smooth and also an inch below the rim. Then add a half-inch of 
mulch to preserve moisture, prevent weeds and most obviously, to keep soil from 
splashing up onto your plants &mdash; ugh. What to use? Pebbles can bake the 
plants, which is fine for succulents. Otherwise use a mulch that cools, like 
bark chips or my favorite, shredded pine bark.</p> 
<h2>Watering</h2> 
<p>If they&rsquo;re sitting in the midday or afternoon sun, most pots need <b>
watering daily,</b> if not more often. Automatic watering systems can work like 
a dream, I&rsquo;m told. I recently saw one that snaked up the posts of a deck 
to automatically water all the pots on the deck. I could use one of those 
myself.</p> 
<h2>Feeding</h2> 
<p>Some experts recommend including fertilizer with every other watering, 
which seems like a lot. I agree with the other experts who suggest<b>every two 
or three weeks.</b> It&rsquo;s best to use an organic fertilizer that&rsquo;s 
diluted in water, like fish emulsion and liquid seaweed.</p> 
<h2>Choosing plants</h2> 
<p>As a general rule always pick plants that are hardier to colder winters 
than where you live because soil that&rsquo;s aboveground gets colder. So, for 
example, in my Zone 7a garden I choose plants hardy to Zone 5 or colder for 
pot. (Most of my in-ground plants are a zone or two hardier than technically 
required, too, but when plants are in pots it&rsquo;s<i>mandatory.</i>) Then 
take note of a plant&rsquo;s watering requirements and ask yourself if 
you&rsquo;ll really be watchful about watering daily, for instance. Next, how 
much sun ya got?<br>
</p> 
<h2>Plants for Containers in the Sun</h2> 
<p>My favorite <b>perennial</b> for pots in the sun you already know &mdash; 
sedums of all types. I also love grasses with trailing plants, the photo right 
being a stunning example of combination.</p> 
<p>The best-looking <b>shrub-</b>in-a-pot I&rsquo;ve grown is that most 
malleable of shrubs, theacuba. More recommendations coming here soon.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried some <b>trees</b> in pots, Korean and Bosnian pines, and a 
couple of short junipers, but one of the pines quickly outgrew its pot and the 
other one I feared wouldn&rsquo;t last long, so I&rsquo;ve moved them both to 
the garden. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they last long, you ask? When their roots expand 
outward enough to contact the pot itself, those freeze-and-thaw cycles are 
murder on them. Paul James confirmed the short-lived nature of most trees in 
pots recently, as did a nurseryman specializing in conifers, when questioned by 
me at a trade show. One possible solution I&rsquo;ve seen suggested is to line 
the inside of the pot with a thin layer of packing wrap, which will expand and 
contract against the side of the pot &mdash; or at least that&rsquo;s the idea. 
(See more about wintering over below.)</p> 
<p>Got a deck you&rsquo;d like to enliven with <b>flowering vines</b>? 
Containers are the way to go, there being no open ground on your deck, and 
here&rsquo;s what the National Arboretum&rsquo;s Scott Aker suggests:</p> 
<p>Trumpet vine (Campus radicans), because it attracts hummingbirds and is 
native to this region, though he considers the Chinese version, Campsis 
grandiflora, even nicer. C. grandiflora &lsquo;Morning Calm&rsquo; is commonly 
available and is compact, with larger flowers than most trumpet vines. Its 
flowers are a mix of peach, pastel orange and light yellow.</p> 
<p>He also recommends large containers &mdash; a cubic yard of potting soil to 
support enough vine to at least partially cover a pergola, for example. If a 
container that size looks bad on the deck, maybe it can be put on the ground 
(as in this photo) and the vines trained up and over the structure you&rsquo;re 
trying to cover.</p> 
<p>And asked about clematis, Aker warns that they really &ldquo;resent&rdquo; 
hot weather and he&rsquo;s seen them grown successfully rarely, and only when 
given some protection from the sun.</p> 
<h2>Plants for Shade or Partial Sun</h2> 
<p>I have lots of plant suggestions here, thanks to Joel Lerner in the <i>
Washington Post.</i> For something you can leave outdoors all year he suggests 
trees, either deciduous or evergreen, plus some perennials or annuals for color 
&mdash; and all but the annuals will winter over.</p> 
<p>For <b>woody plants,</b> he suggests: Japanese maple, Kousa dogwood, 
&lsquo;Little Henry&rsquo;Virginia sweetspire, &lsquo;Emerald&rsquo; 
arborvitae, &lsquo;Hetz Midget&rsquo; arborvitae, dwarf falsecypress 
&lsquo;Nana Gracilis,&rsquo; golden variegated euonymus (E. japonicus 
&lsquo;Aureomarginatus&rsquo;) and wintergreen boxwood.</p> 
<p>Lerner suggests these <b>perennials</b> for pots in the shade : Rhodea, 
hellebore, astilbe, Japanese painted fern, evergreen wood fern, bleeding heart 
&lsquo;Luxuriant&rsquo;, hosta, columbine, cardinal flower, hardy begonia, and 
woodland phlox.</p> 
<p>And his favorite <b>annuals</b> for pots are: coleus, impatiens, 
Joseph&rsquo;s coat, caladium, peacock ginger, elephant ear, rex and tuberous 
begonias, and bacopa.</p> 
<h2>What about Winter?</h2> 
<p>First, will your plants survive winter? (I&rsquo;ll repeat here: 
they&rsquo;d better be hardy to at least one zone colder than where you live.) 
Many gardeners bring their pots indoors for the winter, preferably to a 
basement or garage that stays between 40 and 60 degrees F. (But who has that? 
My garage gets too cold and my basement stays too warm.) Root cellars may be 
best but again, who has that?) If potted plants are tropical they can usually 
be brought indoors to winter over as houseplants, assuming you cut way back on 
the watering and give them the right type and amount of sun.</p> 
<p>Or you can do what&rsquo;s frequently suggested &mdash; leave your 
not-hardy-enough plants outdoors but wrap them up in burlap or bubble wrap or 
something equally unattractive. I find it easy to say no thanks to that idea.
