<h1> Full Text </h1>  Erik Olson: Critics say that the numerous vacant 
storefronts on University Avenue signify a major planning failure.<br>
 &nbsp; 
<h1>News</h1> 
<h2> Vacancies Testify to Stalled Plan </h2> <i>By ANDREW BECKER Special to 
the Planet</i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> For Planning Commissioner Gene Poschman, University Avenue represents more 
than an unfulfilled vision. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I think that this becomes a symbol&mdash;things are not getting 
done right in Berkeley,&rdquo; Poschman said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s brought up 
now because things have gone wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Aside from some completed landscaping projects, the University Avenue 
Strategic Plan has languished since the Berkeley City Council adopted it in 
1996.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Instead of offering pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and businesses that 
merge harmoniously into the surrounding neighborhoods, University Avenue 
continues to be dominated by cars and dotted with empty storefronts. Instead of 
building developments that complement the community, the city has had to accept 
intrusive structures like Acton Court, Poschman said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Acton Court &ldquo;is the poster child for what the avenue can become 
under current zoning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The University Avenue Strategic 
plan was supposed to prevent that kind of gargantuan mess.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> City staffers blame a slumping economy and in-house turnover, while many 
residents blame the city&rsquo;s interpretation of a state affordable housing 
law that allows developers to avoid height limits, parking mandates and other 
design features.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But residents and many city officials&mdash;including Councilmember Linda 
Maio and Mayor Tom Bates&mdash;agree that rezoning the two-mile stretch is 
imperative.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Now, with proposals on the table for at least two five-story building 
developments in the University Avenue Corridor, the strategic plan is starting 
to get attention again.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Poschman acknowledged that there&rsquo;s often a time lag on city projects 
like the University Avenue Strategic Plan. He said he believes the Planning 
Department has its own agenda for the corridor&mdash;which runs west from 
Oxford Street to Interstate 80 and is bounded by Delaware Street to the north 
and Allston Way to the south&mdash;and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a philosophical and ideological debate behind this. 
There&rsquo;s a battle going on,&rdquo; Poschman said. &ldquo;In terms of the 
basic bottom line, the most powerful force in Berkeley is the staff. There are 
about 1,600 of them, and some of them are great. But under the city manager 
system and a council which is sometimes quite divided, there is a lot of 
autonomy [for the staff].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The central conflict is between the Planning Department&rsquo;s belief in 
Smart Growth and neighbors&rsquo; opposition to denser housing, Poschman said. 
He says intentional inactivity is a corollary of the lack of coordination. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I found in the past, when the University Avenue plan goes counter 
to growth orientation, there&rsquo;s no incentive on the part of staff to cause 
things for less growth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a committed agenda. I 
think it&rsquo;s an autonomous agenda.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> He referred to a Smart Growth award the city won for Acton Court, the kind 
of project some on the City Council say they don&rsquo;t ever want to happen 
again. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Interim Berkeley Planning Director Dan Marks, who has held his position 
for five months, said that perceptions notwithstanding, the department 
doesn&rsquo;t chart its own course.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We are servants of the community,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our job is 
to provide Council with information and choices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> He pointed out projects like Acton Court were ultimately decided by City 
Council, and he said the state housing density bonus mandate&mdash;a 
one-size-fits-all law&mdash;makes his department&rsquo;s job more 
difficult.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We feel very constrained by the law,&rdquo; he said. However, 
&ldquo;we need to implement the strategic plan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> One proposed site is Tune-Up Masters, an auto maintenance and repair shop 
at 1698 University Ave. Developers are working on two designs&mdash;one four 
stories, the other five&mdash;after being asked to come up with new plans by 
the Design Review Committee in August, said project planner Aaron Sage. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &ldquo;This project is significant because it&rsquo;s one in a 
series,&rdquo; said Robin Kibby, a University Avenue corridor resident. 
&ldquo;It is more dense than Acton Court, and the next project will be more 
dense than this one. The rules that are being broken in our area can be broken 
in the rest of Berkeley, despite more stringent zoning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> To examine this and other issues, City Council requested a plan update 
report this past summer. Various departments are now preparing and submitting 
their portions of the report to Tom Myers, the city&rsquo;s acting manager of 
the Office of Economic Development, who will compile the final report.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The mayor&rsquo;s Task Force on Permitting and Development is supposed to 
release its findings shortly, and Poschman expects to see the matter on the 
Planning Commission agenda in December.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We need it codified and we need it now,&rdquo; Maio said. 
&ldquo;The managers understand it&mdash;this time we&rsquo;re not taking 
&lsquo;Wait&rsquo; for an answer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Louise Francis, 46, lives on Berkeley Way, two lots from Tune-Up Masters. 
Francis agrees with Maio and Bates that one immediate concern is enforcing 
building standards that haven&rsquo;t been applied since the plan was adopted. 
But she wants more than enforced standards.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;My main desire, what I believe the city needs to do, is to have a 
vision broader than just housing, so we will not have groups divided on the 
Avenue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Planning Department contends there&rsquo;s 
a disconnect between the strategic plan and reality.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In Francis&rsquo; opinion, the quest for denser housing drives the 
planning department&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s best for the 
neighborhood, she said. Part of the problem is interpretation of state law that 
requires cities to have enough affordable housing, she said. To do this, the 
state requires the city to make exceptions to zoning 
regulations&mdash;including height restrictions&mdash;Francis said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Planning Commissioner Rob Wrenn said there&rsquo;s a potential conflict 
between the state requirements and the original plan were it to be 
implemented&mdash;specifically with the decreasing density between the high 
concentration &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; which the plan mandates. But Maio says 
it&rsquo;s now time for the city to finally move forward on the plan.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;It takes a champion and a persistent champion, and certain amounts 
of energy from merchants, and we have that now,&rdquo; Maio said.</p> <br>

<h2> Letters to the Editor </h2> <i></i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> PLAYING PERCENTAGES&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> That demented little coterie who have nothing better to do on Tuesday 
nights than to follow City Council meetings got a rare dose of comic relief at 
a recent public hearing when one councilmember tried to snooker his colleagues 
with some statistical legerdemain. The subject was the narrow difference in 
effective radio transmission between the controversial Public Safety Building 
communications tower and a proposed alternative. Tests had revealed the two 
differed by three percent (one misfired six percent of the time, the other nine 
percent). With a straight face, this councilmember told his colleagues the 
three percent difference was actually a 50 percent gap (three being 50 percent 
of six, right?). A local poet calls his bluff with the following:&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Wozzlebrain Deceives Himself With Statistics,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the Berkeley City Council, &nbsp;</p> 
<p>with condolences.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Behold ex-scientist Wozzlebrain on Monday. With a weekend&rsquo;s rest 
behind him he&rsquo;s using all but six percent of his brain cells. Behold 
ex-scientist Wozzlebrain on Tuesday. After a Berkeley City Council meeting 
he&rsquo;s slipped by three percent. Now nine percent of his brain cells go 
languishing unused. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; growls Wozzlebrain, &ldquo;in just one day I&rsquo;m 
down a full 50 percent!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Buck up!&rdquo; says the poet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re down just three 
percent. The gap between six and nine is just three percent out of your total 
hundred. And three percent, all poets know, is statistically insignificant. 
Relax. You&rsquo;re not actually down at all! If you stay away from City 
Council meetings there may be hope you&rsquo;ll learn to think again!&rdquo; 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> To date the advice has not been accepted. On the contrary: Last Tuesday 
this same facetious fellow read a parody of a sophomore research paper 
purporting to offer a hilariously protracted tangle of statistics as an 
argument against instant run-off voting. Again with a straight face. You 
don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;s serious about these things?&nbsp;</p>

<p>ANIMAL SHELTER&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We support Jill&rsquo;s Posener view of the Berkeley Animal Shelter. It 
can&rsquo;t be in an out-of-the-way place. It has to be where the human 
community is, so people will have a daily dose of dog or cat, because it is so 
soothing. It must be where volunteers want to walk dogs without fear. It should 
be a place where potential adopters can easily get to the Berkeley Shelter to 
adopt dogs and/or cats. The Berkeley Animal Cares Services will be in the 
building for maybe 50 years, so you have to design it well and place it 
excellently. We support the Sixth and Gilman site!&nbsp;</p>

<p>NEIGHBORHOOD EYESORE&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As we look out the front window of our home there are piles of trash and 
debris and an ancient, dilapidated mobile home with squatters living in it. 
There are no electricity, running water, or sewage hook-ups to the mobile home. 
The squatters have been living in this mobile home and in a second vehicle, an 
equally tattered RV, since May.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The property, located in the 2800 block of San Pablo Avenue, has been our 
neighborhood&rsquo;s eyesore for four years. It has been the site of an arson 
fire, a haven for prostitution, and the location of numerous altercations over 
bad business dealings. The lot historically has been classified as a used car 
lot; however the use permits have expired long ago, there are no other existing 
permits, and property taxes are in arrears. The owner of the property lives out 
of town. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Long before the squatters moved in, we had been trying to gain the City of 
Berkeley&rsquo;s interest in the property&rsquo;s numerous and ongoing 
problems. In June of 2003 the new City agency &ldquo;Code Enforcement&rdquo; 
finally took an interest. A hearing was later scheduled Oct. 5 before the 
Zoning Adjustments Board. During that meeting the board unanimously designated 
the property a &ldquo;nuisance,&rdquo; and clearly stated that abatement should 
be the course of action. The board expressed their admiration for our 
neighborhoods&rsquo; willingness to tackle this difficult problem. It has now 
been over eight weeks since that meeting, and still, there has been no action 
taken by the city. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The San Pablo Park Neighborhood has been working for over two years with 
the city agencies to remedy this intolerable situation. It has required two 
appearances before the Zoning Adjustments Board, hours of neighborhood 
organizing, countless phone calls and letters, and coordination of the 
city&rsquo;s agencies for the entire time. While it has been our experience 
that all the agencies&mdash;Department of Health, Code Enforcement, 
Neighborhood Services and the ZAB&mdash; have been sympathetic and kind, our 
problem is still across the street and out patience has worn thin.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> No citizen should be required to work so hard to fix a problem that should 
be addressed by the agencies who exist to protect the health, safety and the 
well being of all neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DOWNTOWN&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Mr. Geller&rsquo;s development vision of downtown Berkeley is mostly 
appropriate and quite achievable (Letters, Daily Planet, Nov. 25-27). We can 
cut downtown traffic significantly. Very dense cities in Europe do it and these 
city governments also manage to efficiently implement planned 
pedestrian/public-transportation-only urban centers in cramped and much more 
heavily regulated circumstances. We need not reinvent the wheel. The public 
will need to be continuously educated and involved in every step of the 
process, online and in person, through opinionated open-door planning sessions. 
In Ithaca, NY&mdash; a much smaller city with absolutely greater downtown 
appeal than Berkeley&mdash; there is a wonderful pedestrian mall that functions 
as it was designed to and has blossomed over the years since its creation into 
a diverse and profitable business open space and has year-round heavily 
attended community functions. We very much need to provide a large number of 
urban periphery municipal parking spaces under a cohesive, practical and 
well-funded transportation plan with free shuttles to both BART and local 
busing options. If the $60,000 a year incredibly necessary YEAH! Youth Homeless 
Shelter can coordinate shuttle services, certainly funds for comfortable free 
shuttles to and from periphery parking can happen for commuters and visitors 
arriving via auto from out of town.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On the related Berkeley building heights issue, I believe we need 
less-than-10-story structures with periphery and local above-ground parking. I 
have to agree with Tom Brown (Letters, Daily Planet, Nov. 28-Dec. 1) that 
underground parking is not environment friendly or cost effective. I think the 
sunlight issue is easily addressed by use of Japanese Sunflower fiber-optic or 
similar technology that pipes sunlight san UV&rsquo;s wherever it is needed. 
Plants love this UV-less light. By all means daylight the full length of 
Strawberry Creek. What the heck is it doing underground anyway? It&rsquo;s not 
like we&rsquo;re changing the course of the Yangtze here! I don&rsquo;t think 
that Berkeley currently has much of a downtown. It&rsquo;s not now charming, 
pastoral or particularly interesting. Berkeley downtown is loud and dirty. We 
can bellweather a progressive planning trend in mid-sized US metros. The 
resources are there. I agree with Tom Bates that even the local progressive 
media often emphasize the wrong issues. We really need to have more taxation 
for necessary services since the fed and state are going republocrat nuts with 
selfish, heartless and unrealistic slash and burn economic tactics. I 
don&rsquo;t believe in raising property taxes on the ever struggling US middle 
and lower classes or poorer small business. However, taxation must increase on 
the individual and corporate rich. One way to achieve proportionate and 
appropriate taxation on the wealthy is to provide a non-negotiable higher 
taxation gradient for more valuable personal and corporate property transfers. 
A similar tactic to that which Matt Gonzalez correctly proposes for SFO. The 
wealthy&rsquo;s unequal wealth is usually due to under-compensation of the 
poor. The rich are obligated as community members to balance the scales 
wherever they live or do business officially. Raising revenues need be neither 
painful nor unjust. For every problem, it has been my experience, there is a 
multiplicity of satisfying and exemplary solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2> Winter Brings Array of Eclectic Musical Theater </h2> <i>By C. 
Suprynowicz Special to the Planet</i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> Mortgaging the Earth is the name of John Halle&rsquo;s new work for two 
sopranos and chamber ensemble, being presented tonight [Tuesday Dec. 2] in a 
program by Composers Inc. The text is a doozy, an internal memo from Lawrence 
Summers (then chief economic advisor to the World Bank, now president of 
Harvard). &ldquo;Just between you and me,&rdquo; Summers wrote,&rdquo; 
shouldn&rsquo;t the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty 
industries to the Less Developed Countries? I can think of three 
reasons.&rdquo; Those reasons, and the music they inspired, comprise the piece. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Halle is a homeboy who&rsquo;s done good. Once a UC Berkeley undergrad in 
composition, he&rsquo;s now teaching at Yale. Composers on the rest of this 
program are Alejandro Escuer, Arthur Krieger, Kevin Beavers, Paul Barsom, with 
Berkeley Opera&rsquo;s own Jonathan Khuner conducting. The performance is 
tonight at 8 p.m. in the Green Room of the Veterans Building, 401 Van Ness 
Ave., San Francisco. Real darn soon, in other words, so stick this paper in 
your pocket and get on the train. Composers, Inc. is an illustrious Bay Area 
enterprise, teaming up first-rate composers with equally stellar 
performers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If you subscribe to the theory that scrappy arts venues are a precursor to 
big-time gentrification, downtown Oakland may be ready for its oft-rumored, 
oft-postponed real estate boom. The logic is that when deserted storefronts 
give way to theaters and rehearsal space, optimistic developers cannot be far 
behind. What then happens to the artists we will cover at another time.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Out in front of the speculative curve, not only do we have the Oakland Box 
Theater at 20th and Telegraph (previously cited in this column), and the 
Oakland Metro at the base of Broadway. Now there&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; Van Kleef 
at 1621 Telegraph, a classy bistro with live music, art on the walls, and 
espresso at the bar. Mayor Jerry Brown may be seen from time to time, wafting 
in from his new digs up the street where Sears once was. Meanwhile, any 
direction you go, developers are throwing money at buildings that have been 
vacant for years.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> At the South end of the strip, courtesy of the Oakland Metro (201 
Broadway; tel: 763-1146), you have a chance to see Gertrude Stein&rsquo;s Four 
Saints in Three Acts, running Dec. 5-14. Stein left Oakland for Paris while 
still in her teen years, and in 1926 teamed up with another American expat, 
composer Virgil Thomson. Eight years later, their opera Four Saints became a 
sensation, an infamous cultural event in its time, and the longest-running 
opera in Broadway history to date. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> There seems to be some sort of low-level Stein revival underway. The San 
Francisco Opera put up Mother Of Us All earlier in the season, and the Metro 
(also known as Oakland Opera Theater) did Three Sisters Who Are Not Sisters 
last year. Lori Zook, executive director of O.O.T., has been struck by the 
strange, canny craftsmanship of Stein&rsquo;s text and lyrics. She recalled to 
me her disorientation at early rehearsals, then the pleasure of hearing 
correspondences emerge between lines, phrases, themes. Stein can be seen 
(though credit is rarely given her) as a forerunner of John Ashbery, James 
Tate, James Merrill&mdash;those contemporary poets who &ldquo;Tell it 
slant,&rdquo; as Virginia Woolf used to say. As for the folks at the Oakland 
Metro, god bless &lsquo;em for conjuring this peculiar and wonderful show, in 
this case with a live 11-piece orchestra and digitally projected scenery. Give 
them your money.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Still in Oakland (we&rsquo;ll get to Berkeley in a minute), Arthur Blythe 
is at Yoshi&rsquo;s with his quartet on Monday, Dec. 15. It&rsquo;s nice that 
Yoshi&rsquo;s is continuing to work with Jazz In Flight on their Monday night 
series; this writer hopes they will reconsider their jitters when it comes to 
booking local artists at the venue. There are some powerfully good jazz 
musicians around here without many places to play.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> While we&rsquo;re talking jazz, can we get straight, if possible, what is 
going on with these Berkeley High kids? Is it something they&rsquo;re putting 
in the water? The players are so good they&rsquo;re scary, and they keep coming 
up with the goods year after year. Charles Hamilton, head of the program, 
certainly deserves credit, but let&rsquo;s give the kids their due. A list of 
shining stars from recent years would include Peter Apfelbaum, Will Bernard, 
Dave Ellis, Rodney Franklin, Kito Gamble, Benny Green, David Murray, Lenny 
Pickett, Josh Redman, Michael Wolff, and Hitomi Oba. The next scheduled concert 
for the Berkeley High Jazz Band and Combos is not here in Berkeley, but will be 
the CSUS Winter Jazz Festival in Sacramento on Saturday, Dec. 13. For 
information, cal (916)691-7170. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Lastly but not leastly, Larry Ochs, Fred Frith, and Miya Masaoka will be 
at the Free Gallery, 2575 Bancroft Way between College and Telegraph in 
Berkeley at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday Dec. 4. As we&rsquo;re all soon to be awash 
in Messiahs and Requiems, this is as musically provocative a combination as 
you&rsquo;re likely to find for the duration of the holidays. And I believe in 
supporting any venue I&rsquo;ve never heard of just on principle. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Remember, go in peace. And if you can&rsquo;t go in peace, just go. </p>

<h2> Healthcare Sales Tax Heads for Ballot Box </h2> <i>By MATTHEW ARTZ</i> <i>
Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> Berkeley voters will get to weigh in on a proposed tax hike this March 
after all. On the same evening Council withdrew a proposed parcel tax hike, the 
Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to place a half-penny tax 
increase on the March ballot to bail out cash-strapped public medical 
facilities.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The tax&mdash;which needs two-thirds approval from county 
voters&mdash;would raise the sales tax to 8.75 percent, catapulting Alameda 
County past San Francisco for the highest sales tax rates in state.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> County officials estimate the tax would generate $90 million annually, 
with 75 percent earmarked for the Alameda County Medical Center&mdash;whose 
budget deficit has exploded to $86 million from $45.7 million in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The medical center provides care to the county&rsquo;s indigent and 
uninsured and includes Oakland&rsquo;s Highland Hospital&mdash;which serves the 
majority of Berkeley trauma and emergency patients and is the lone specialized 
medical care option for Berkeley&rsquo;s estimated 9,000-11,000 uninsured 
residents.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;This is a life-saving measure,&rdquo; said Alameda County Director 
of Health Care Services Dave Kears. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t sustain the system 
for long without some sort of government subsidy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The medical center&mdash;which also includes Fairmont Hospital in San 
Leandro, John George Psychiatric Pavilion in San Leandro and three outpatient 
clinics&mdash;has seen its $353 million budget busted by funding cuts, expense 
increases and swelling ranks of the uninsured they are mandated to serve.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to understand these problems aren&rsquo;t a 
case of bad management,&rdquo; Kears said. &ldquo;Most of this has been beyond 
anyone&rsquo;s control.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Last year, 63,500 of the center&rsquo;s 125,000 patients were uninsured. 
Coupled with increased expenses for employee benefits and drugs and reductions 
in government aid&mdash;including a $7 million cut from a federal program 
aiding public hospitals&mdash;the center has struggled to balance its books, 
said spokesperson Rachel Kagen.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Two rounds of cutbacks earlier this year totaling $23.5 million resulted 
in 150 layoffs, closure of two outpatient clinics, increased patient 
co-payments as well as a call to deny non-emergency care to indigents.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Kagen said implementing the policy denying non-emergency care has proven 
difficult because many doctors and staffers refuse to turn away patients.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Next week the center will present county supervisors plans for $53 million 
in further cuts, including elimination of another 176 positions, ending all 
specialty care at outpatient clinics, and closing a cardiac ward and 
obstetrician services at Highland, a psychiatric ward at John George, and a 
nursing home at Fairmont.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If the supervisors accept the plan, the center must still cut another $33 
million to eliminate its deficit. Even with the sales tax revenues, Kagen said, 
he probably couldn&rsquo;t salvage services already on the chopping block, 
though the funds could help sustain Highland&rsquo;s emergency room and trauma 
center.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The proposed tax hike&mdash;called the Essential Health Care Services 
Tax&mdash;would give center facilities autonomy in distributing the money and 
would not replace money the county already provides for indigent care.&nbsp;</p>
<p> County supervisors have feuded with the center&rsquo;s county-appointed 
board of trustees this year over the budget deficit.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In July, after the supervisors reduced the authority of former CEO Kenneth 
Cohen&mdash;who they blamed for failing to implement cuts when revenues first 
started evaporating and then proposing cuts far too drastic&mdash;five center 
trustees voted to fire Cohen and then quit in protest, citing frustration with 
the supervisors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Supervisor Keith Carson said he hoped an independent financial audit due 
out next week will uncover possible savings to preserve services slated for the 
chopping block.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had a line-by-line review of expenditures and 
revenues,&rdquo; Carson said, adding that the estimated $86 million deficit 
could be lower if state reimbursements have not been received.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> To boost revenue, the center is seeking to improve services to attract 
insured patients, but two of the more profitable departments, cardiac and 
obstetrics, are slated for cuts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In light of the firestorm in Berkeley over a proposed parcel tax, Carson 
said the board would campaign hard for the tax measure and start a mobilization 
drive to get supporters to the polls.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Voters have given mixed signals in recent years on their willingness to 
shoulder high sales taxes, passing a half-cent increase two years ago to pay 
for transportation improvements after rejecting it the year before.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If the measure is passed, county supervisors promise to seek public input 
on which health programs to fund with the remaining 25 percent of the 
funds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Kears said a county Detox center&mdash;long sought by Berkeley homeless 
advocates&mdash; would likely be a top priority.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Lifelong Medical, Berkeley&rsquo;s care provider for uninsured residents, 
could also receive increased funds from the tax measure. Executive Director 
Marty Lynch said with fewer insured residents and less public money to pay for 
them, Lifelong has had to turn back 20-30 patients per week at its four 
clinics.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Berkeley Director of Public Health Poki Namkung said city-run health 
centers across the state face similar problems, noting that if Gov. 
Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s proposed 10 percent reduction in Medi-Cal reimbursements 
passes, the city&rsquo;s three clinics stand to lose about $75,000&mdash;30 
percent of its budget. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Alameda County Taxpayers Association endorsed the tax hike after 
learning it will sunset in 2019.</p> <br>

<h2> CIA Training of Islamists Haunts GIs in Iraq </h2> <i>By PETER DALE SCOTT 
Pacific News Service</i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> The recent downing of U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Iraq is yet another 
example of how the aid supplied by the CIA to Islamist terrorists in the 1980s 
has contributed to the escalation and spread of terrorism everywhere in the 
world. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> At least two of the U.S. Black Hawk helicopters that crashed in Iraq 
recently were brought down by the same sophisticated technique&mdash;by taking 
out the ship's vulnerable tail rotor with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). As 
right-wing columnists and web sites have been quick to point out, this is 
exactly the technique that brought down three Black Hawks in Mogadishu, 
Somalia, in October 1993. Three weeks after this devastating attack, the United 
States pulled out of Somalia, an event Osama bin Laden has cited as proof that 
America can be defeated. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> But no one to date has pointed out what Mark Bowden, author of the best 
account of that battle, Black Hawk Down, reported: that the Somalis on the 
ground had been trained by Arabs who had fought against the Soviets in 
Afghanistan. As Bowden wrote, it was these Arabs who taught that the best way 
to bring down a helicopter with an RPG was to shoot for the tail rotor (which 
keeps the helicopter from spinning by countering torque from its main rotor). 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We now know that the Arab trainers of the Somalis were members of al 
Qaeda. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In his book on al Qaeda, Holy War, Peter Bergen said of the Mogadishu 
battle: &ldquo;A U.S. official told me that the skills involved in shooting 
down those helicopters were not skills that the Somalis could have learned on 
their own.&rdquo; In other words, the training that the United States supplied 
to Islamists in the Afghan War in the 1980s, when the emphasis was on bringing 
down Soviet helicopters, is still coming back to haunt the United States today. 
That training, according to author George Crile, author of Charlie Wilson's 
War, about the CIA's arming of Islamists during the Afghan War, even included 
&ldquo;urban terror, with instruction in car bombings, bicycle bombings, camel 
bombings, and assassination.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> One trainer of the Somalis, Egyptian-born Ali Mohamed, was also a veteran 
of U.S. Special Forces and the CIA. While allegedly still on the U.S. payroll, 
Mohamed had been recruiting and training Arabs for the U.S.-supported Afghan 
War, at the al-Kifah Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. This served as the main American 
recruiting center for the network that after the war became known as al Qaeda. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In 1993, the year of Mogadishu, Mohamed was picked up by the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police in Canada in the company of an al Qaeda terrorist. 
Almost certainly he would have been arrested; but Mohamed insisted that the 
RCMP put in a phone call to his FBI handler. The call quickly secured his 
release. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Toronto daily Globe and Mail later concluded that Mohamed &quot;was 
working with U.S. counter-terrorist agents, playing a double or triple game, 
when he was questioned in 1993.&quot; Mohamed, who was implicated along with 
al-Kifah veterans in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, was arrested 
again after the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Escaping trial 
by a negotiated plea, he was in a U.S. prison as late as 2001. His service to 
al Qaeda is clear and admitted; it is not clear that he has done anything to 
benefit the United States. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> It is now over 10 years since the first U.S. Black Hawks were downed by 
hits on the tail rotor with RPGs. U.S. pilots have developed countermeasures, 
by quickly cutting off their engines to avoid a fatal spin. But in March 2002 
the same technique was used again effectively by al Qaeda and Taliban remnants 
in Afghanistan. In Operation Anaconda of that month, RPGs, by hitting the tail 
rotors, incapacitated several U.S. Air Force Apache helicopters. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> It is of course easy in retrospect to challenge the wisdom of having 
imparted such skills to jihad-waging Islamists. These were extremists who, even 
at the time, made it clear they despised the West almost as much as they did 
the Soviet Union. But what remains is the dangerous system whereby small 
numbers of policy-makers, acting at the very highest levels of secrecy, are 
able to make ill-considered decisions that will have long-term, tragic effects 
worldwide. &nbsp;</p>

<h2> Council Gives Okay To Wheelchair Cabs </h2> <i>By J. DOUGLAS ALLEN-TAYLOR
</i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> The Chairperson of Berkeley&rsquo;s Commission On Disabilities joyfully 
hailed Berkeley City Council&rsquo;s recent decision to authorize five 
wheelchair-accessible taxis in the city, even though the number was halved from 
the originally requested 10.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working on this a long time,&rdquo; said a smiling 
and excited Emily Wilcox shortly after Council voted on first reading last week 
to amend the city&rsquo;s taxi ordinance to include the new disability-friendly 
vehicles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We would have liked the whole 120 cabs in Berkeley to be 
wheelchair-accessible, of course, but this is a start. We&rsquo;ll use this 
program to iron out the problems in the system. I&rsquo;m just glad it&rsquo;s 
done.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Commission on Disability first requested permits for 
wheelchair-accessible taxis in Berkeley in 1999 and was later joined in the 
effort by the Commission on Aging. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Mayor Tom Bates called the pilot project &ldquo;just a toe in the water. 
If it&rsquo;s successful, then we can expand it to provide a lot more services 
for our people.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Permitted taxis will be vans equipped with retractable ramps&mdash;which 
will also be available for taxi riders in the city who don&rsquo;t use 
wheelchairs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> People using wheelchairs that can&rsquo;t be folded can&rsquo;t use taxis 
currently operating out of Berkeley and must either use AC Transit buses 
equipped with motorized lifts or schedule transportation with East Bay 
Paratransit services, a joint consortium of AC Transit and the Bay Area Rapid 
Transit District.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> However, several Berkeley citizens using the service, including 
Councilmember Dona Spring, said East Bay Paratransit rides must be scheduled at 
least 24 hours in advance. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not reliable even with a 
reservation,&rdquo; Spring told Council, stating that her experience has been 
that &ldquo;one out of five times, the East Bay Paratransit van doesn&rsquo;t 
show up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Council&rsquo;s decided for the wheelchair taxis after emotional testimony 
from Disability Commissioner Marissa Shaw, who cited the recent automobile 
accident death of Berkeley activist Fred Lupke as a reason to approve the 
project.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Lupke was struck by a car while riding his motorized wheelchair in the 
street along Ashby Avenue, trying to maneuver around an uneven stretch of 
sidewalk. Shaw, who also uses a wheelchair, said that &ldquo;there have been 
many other members of [the disabled] community who have been killed or injured 
in accidents. If the taxi option had been available, their lives could have

well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h2> In Defense of Same Sex Marriage </h2> <i>Mary Ager</i> <i>Tuesday 
December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The road leading to full inclusion of gay civil marriage in California 
state law has been marked with detours to the land of &ldquo;domestic 
partnership.&rdquo; Like the recent Massachusetts groundbreaking decision, it 
is now time for Californians to travel a more direct route to this destination 
by directly challenging the constitutionality of restrictive state marriage 
laws. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In April 2001, 11 gay and lesbian couples in Massachusetts applied for a 
marriage license. All were denied, and thus began their adventure working to 
legalize gay marriage. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> On Nov. 19, 2003, they and thousands of their gay and lesbian neighbors 
arrived at their destination: The state Supreme Court ruled that it is 
unconstitutional to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying because, in the 
words of the chief justice, to exclude gays from marriage &ldquo;is 
incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual 
autonomy and equality under law.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Similar to Massachusetts, the California State Constitution opens with the 
following statement: &ldquo;All people are by nature free and independent and 
have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and 
liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and 
obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Gay marriage is legally consistent with this basic civil tenet, because it 
recognizes that adult citizens have the autonomy to be able to enter into legal 
relationships of their choice without state interference or moral 
obstruction.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In California, the legal relationship between committed gays and lesbians 
has been relinquished to the creation of a dazzlingly unequal system that in 
very few ways parallels marriage: domestic partnership. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In 1999, California created a state Domestic Partner Registry, required 
hospitals to extend visitation to domestic partners, and allowed state workers 
to receive health benefits for their partners. Two years later, in the 
aftermath of the Knight initiative that passed defining marriage as being 
between a man and a woman, another law was enacted that allowed twelve new 
domestic partner rights. Most recently, in what the media erroneously called 
the &ldquo;Virtual Gay Marriage Act,&rdquo; approximately a dozen new rights 
were bestowed by the Legislature, such as community property ownership 
protections and bereavement leave for state employees. California cities have 
embraced this legal definition of domestic partnership by creating similar 
municipal laws.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> These 27 state domestic partnership rights pale in comparison to the more 
than 1,000 state and federal rights granted legally married couples. Even the 
nomenclature &ldquo;domestic partnership&rdquo; clearly shows separate legal 
status from marriage, and highlights the second-class position of committed gay 
relationships in the eyes of the law.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Until 1948, it was illegal in the United States for a white person to 
marry a person of color. The landmark case that originated in Los Angeles when 
Andrea Perez, who was white, filed a marriage certificate with Sylvester Davis, 
who was black, changed racist and exclusionary marriage laws, finding them 
unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court. In this ruling, justices 
concurred that marriage is a fundamental right of all citizens, and moreover 
that &ldquo;Legislation infringing such rights must be based upon more than 
prejudice and must be free from oppressive discrimination to comply with the 
constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of the 
laws.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The road has been paved, both in Massachusetts and California, for gay 
marriage to be legally recognized.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Now, it takes brave souls to travel this difficult but rewarding path, 
like the 11 in Massachusetts or the two back in 1948, to judicially challenge 
restrictive marriage laws in California.&nbsp;</p>

<h2> Tower Compromise Near? </h2> <i>By J. DOUGLAS ALLEN-TAYLOR</i> <i>Tuesday 
December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> Berkeley City Council crafted a possible solution to the lingering Public 
Safety Building antennae tower controversy Tuesday night, holding off 
threatened legal action by downtown area residents.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On a motion from Councilmember Dona Spring, Council voted 6-2-1 
(Worthington and Wozniak voting no, Shirek abstaining) to investigate putting 
up a single 160-foot pole to replace the current 160-foot multi-antennae tower. 
The compromise was passed after councilmembers were assured that the 
replacement pole would only be studied, with no commitment from Council to do 
anything more until the city&rsquo;s present budget crisis is over. Council 
also required that nothing would be spent for outside consultants on the 
upcoming study without Council&rsquo;s specific say-so.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The study will be undertaken jointly by the city&rsquo;s Zoning 
Adjustments Board, Design Review Committee, and Landmarks Preservation 
Commission.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I think that the commissions can evaluate what would have been 
appropriate for that site like they would have done in the beginning had it 
gone through the correct process,&rdquo; said Councilmember Linda Maio. 
&ldquo;[Our current fiscal crisis] shouldn&rsquo;t stop us from doing the right 
thing when we&rsquo;re able to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The tower was built atop the Public Safety Building on Martin Luther King 
Jr. Drive in 1999 to replace two existing 130-foot antennae. Neighbors 
immediately dubbed the tower a &ldquo;monstrosity,&rdquo; saying it was out of 
character with the historic downtown neighborhood, never properly noticed to 
the public in the project&rsquo;s Environmental Impact Review, and never 
subjected to the city&rsquo;s commission evaluation process. They had earlier 
asked that the tower be torn down and replaced with the original 130-foot 
pair.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> City public safety officials countered that the larger tower eliminates 
some of the city&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;communications dead spots&rdquo; 
along the edge of the hills and in some West Berkeley neighborhoods where 
police with hand-held communications devices could not exchange messages with 
police headquarters under the two-antennae system.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Some councilmembers had argued that even if the larger tower was 
improperly erected, the present lean economic times made it impossible for the 
city to correct the problem by tearing down a &ldquo;perfectly good 
communications tower.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A report on the ongoing controversy, which has gone through several 
studies and hearings, filled nearly 400 pages in last Tuesday&rsquo;s Council 
packet.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If the 160-foot monopole antennae proves to have the same communications 
coverage as the existing 160-foot antennae tower, it would allay the concerns 
of city public safety officials about cutting back on communications 
efficiency. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Speaking for downtown residents, many of whom signed petitions and filed 
appeals against the tower during the past four years, Berkeley schoolteacher 
Zoe Kalkanis earlier told City Council that neighbors of the Public Service 
Building didn&rsquo;t want to cause the city any financial problems. &ldquo;We 
simply want to work with the city in developing the most effective public 
safety system possible while respecting the character of our residential 
neighborhood and without defacing our historic civic center,&rdquo; she 
said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Calling the present tower an &ldquo;oil derrick,&rdquo; Kalkanis urged 
Councilmembers to &ldquo;submit alternatives to the present tower to the 
standard review process.&rdquo; If not, she added, &ldquo;our attorney informs 
us we have clear grounds for legal action. It&rsquo;s not the route we want to 
pursue. But if the city forecloses other relief, it is the course we&rsquo;ll 
be forced to take.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<h2> Academic Culture Shock </h2> <i>From Susan Parker</i> <i>Tuesday December 
02, 2003</i> 
<p> Now that my first semester of graduate school at San Francisco State is 
winding down, it&rsquo;s time to reflect on what I&rsquo;ve accomplished and 
learned. Until Sept. 1, I hadn&rsquo;t been back on a college campus in 32 
years. It turns out that I had a lot of catching up to do.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The first shock was registration. Instead of standing in line in a big 
gymnasium, I stood in line in cyberspace and got none of my first or second 
choices in classes. Finally, after weeks of visiting the Graduate Creative 
Writing office and asking permission from professors half my age if I could get 
into one of their workshops, I settled into three courses: Beginning Novel, 
Advanced Short Stories, and the Business of Writing. I had already started a 
novel so I wasn&rsquo;t too worried about fulfilling the requirements of that 
class.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But the trauma of having it ripped apart by my fellow students was 
something I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for. Over and over my classmates told me that 
my protagonist was a witch, a bitch and worse. They disliked her so much they 
didn&rsquo;t want to read further. Their criticism stung on a very personal 
level. I needed to learn how to write fiction.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In short story class I learned to compose in the third person. I felt that 
I had made a giant step forward in my efforts to craft a fictional tale. But 
when I started reading my classmates&rsquo; short stories I realized that there 
was more to this class than just changing &ldquo;I&rdquo; to 
&ldquo;Priscilla.&rdquo; I had to study up on pop culture. I hadn&rsquo;t a 
clue what song lyrics or bands my classmates were referring to, what movie 
scenes they were emulating, what authors they were copying, what drugs their 
characters were taking. I needed to know about Goth clubs, massage parlors, 
obscure British rock bands, new slang terms. I needed to read Less Than Zero or 
I was never going to make it in the class.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When one of the students handed in a story about a young woman going to 
college in the 70s I breathed a sigh of relief. Now here was a narrative 
I&rsquo;d be able to critique with knowledge and fairness. But he got so many 
facts wrong about clothes, hair styles, cars, drinking habits and music, I 
spent my entire critique correcting his historical errors, not his actual 
writing. It was disconcerting and sobering to learn that he considered me, the 
perky co-ed sitting beside him, a representative of an ancient and extinct 
culture.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When I told a friend I was getting an MFA in creative writing at San 
Francisco State, she looked at me quizzically. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 
wrong?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Her reply was measured. &ldquo;Oh nothing,&rdquo; she said. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I was under the impression that questioning 
one&rsquo;s gender and sexuality were a prerequisite to the curriculum. Is 
there anything you want to tell me?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not questioning my sexuality, 
but I am wondering about my sanity. I need new jeans and underwear. I&rsquo;m 
supposed to wear low cut Levis that expose the top of my thong when I bend 
forward a fraction of an inch. I need platform shoes and multiple tattoos. It 
might help if I were to get my nose pierced and dyed my hair blue. Instead of a 
book bag, I need a large backpack or a suitcase with wheels.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Suzy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need any of those 
things, but your sanity? Well, that&rsquo;s something you should have 
questioned a long time ago.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Now I&rsquo;m busy trying to figure out what classes I&rsquo;ll take next 
semester. I&rsquo;ve studied the MFA curriculum as well as the undergraduate 
creative writing offerings and the nursing school&rsquo;s courses in geriatric 
studies. Just for kicks I did a search to see what the history department was 
offering. What I found surprised me. There are no courses dedicated to the 
history of the 60s and 70s. I&rsquo;m making an appointment with the chairman 
of the history department today and offering my expertise. These are classes I 
don&rsquo;t need to take&mdash;these are courses I can teach.</p> <br>

<h2> Police Blotter </h2> <i>By MATTHEW ARTZ</i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003

<p> Cyclist Foils Would-be Bandits&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Police arrested two juveniles Saturday after the failed robbery of a bike 
rider. The victim was riding her bike along the 1800 block of Channing Way at 
10:08 p.m. when a youth on a bike chased her down and yanked on her purse, 
police said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The woman clung to her purse, causing her to fall to the pavement where a 
second youth tried to pull it away. The cyclist held tight, and when she 
started yelling the two youths and a companion fled the scene.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Minutes later, police stopped four youths at the intersection of Dwight 
Way and California Street, and the cyclist made positive identifications of 
two, who were charged with attempted robbery and released to their 
parents.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Restaurant Robbed&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Two men robbed the Popeye&rsquo;s Restaurant on the 1700 block of San 
Pablo Avenue Saturday night. Police said one robber wielded a gun, jumped the 
counter and demanded money from an employee, who handed over the cash from a 
safe before the bandits fled out the back door.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dominos Delivers, Even When Robbed&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A Dominos Pizza delivery man was robbed at gunpoint while walking back to 
his car after fulfilling an order Saturday evening on the 1500 block of Prince 
Street. When the thief brandished a pistol and demanded money, the victim 
complied&mdash;then completed his other deliveries before calling police.</p>

<h2> Reds, Greens Wage the Berkeley Foliage Battle </h2> <i>By Steven Finacom 
Special to the Planet</i> <i>Tuesday December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> It&rsquo;s that time of year again&mdash;Fall, when there&rsquo;s visible 
evidence on the streets of a major divide in viewpoints between Berkeley 
residents. I&rsquo;m talking about the possibly irreconcilable differences 
between Berkeley&rsquo;s Greens and Reds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> These aren&rsquo;t political differences, however. In this context, Green 
and Red are not political ideologies but, rather, the colors of street trees at 
this time of year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> You see, Berkeley has a vocal contingent of residents who believe that 
&ldquo;Fall color&rdquo; is a necessary element of the autumn season and should 
be constantly increased. They&rsquo;re the Reds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On the other hand, there are those who believe that Berkeley&rsquo;s 
natural color this time of year is, and should primarily remain, green.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Let me declare my allegiance right off. In terms of the Fall color 
question I&rsquo;m generally a Green, with a tinge of Red.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I came to this viewpoint gradually after multiple conversations along 
these lines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Me: &ldquo;Berkeley should have more street trees.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Red: &ldquo;Yes, I agree. But they must be trees that provide Fall 
color.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Me: &ldquo;And why is that, exactly?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Red: &ldquo;Because in the Fall you need Fall color.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Me: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Red: &ldquo;Because.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In these exchanges that often come to resemble kindergarten conversations, 
I&rsquo;ve come to this conclusion about the motivation of Berkeley&rsquo;s 
Reds: They have an idealized view of Fall as it&rsquo;s experienced in the 
American Northeast and they want it here, too.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It&rsquo;s no surprise. Berkeley has lots of expatriate New Yorkers and 
New Englanders, and while some of them have adjusted to the more salubrious Bay 
Area climate, others pine (or should I say, maple?) for visible reminders of 
home.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It&rsquo;s funny, though, but I don&rsquo;t hear similar arguments being 
offered for the importation of other memorable reminders of Northeastern 
weather&mdash;slush and snow, ice storms, humid summers, or swarms of biting 
flies and midges, for instance. No, it&rsquo;s just Fall color some people 
want.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I don&rsquo;t mind some Fall color, but too much of it is wrong for 
Berkeley.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Real Fall color often requires sharply dropping temperatures and frosts. 
Berkeley just doesn&rsquo;t have those on a reliably regular basis. And the 
trees often show it. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Take the gloriously named Scarlet Oak, for instance. It sounds red, 
doesn&rsquo;t it? Really red. Wouldn&rsquo;t you be tempted to buy one just 
because of the name? In reality, in most places I&rsquo;ve seen it planted in 
Berkeley, it&rsquo;s not at all red in the Fall. It&rsquo;s more like dead. As 
December approaches the leaves turn a lovely fawn brown and mournfully hang on 
the tree until some mid-winter storm finally shakes them off.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I have no doubt that Scarlet Oaks blaze vivid red or purple in sharper 
climates, but here they can be a profound disappointment as far as Fall color 
is concerned. As are elms, sycamores, and other trees of their ilk, with leaves 
that turn, at best, a feeble blotchy yellow or tan as Fall approaches. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Another reason why too much Fall color is undesirable in Berkeley has to 
do with the essential fact that Fall color means leaves are dropped. Beyond the 
clogged gutters and endless raking that result, the trees are barren during the 
winter. And that&rsquo;s a disappointment hereabouts in late January or 
February when we&rsquo;ve had a few months of chilly, wet, weather and 
it&rsquo;s important to see some green, instead of just gray branches 
mournfully dripping rain. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> You may have already noticed that on some of Berkeley&rsquo;s major 
commercial streets, including Shattuck Avenue, replacing evergreen street trees 
with deciduous species has been the trend in recent years. Take a look later 
this winter, and consider whether trees that are green all year might not have 
made more sense.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> That&rsquo;s the way nature made Berkeley. Two of Berkeley&rsquo;s 
keystone native tree species&mdash;live oaks and bay laurels&mdash;are green 
year round. Of the larger trees that once flourished in Berkeley&rsquo;s 
natural landscape only buckeyes entirely drop their leaves, and that usually 
happens in the dry late summer, well before conventional autumn weather 
arrives. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> And remember that the Berkeley Hills themselves, come Fall, turn green. 
Autumn in the Bay Area is when the rains return bringing the quickening and 
reinvigoration of much of the landscape, not the beginning of annual 
dormancy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Another problem with too much emphasis on Fall color is that it reduces 
the opportunity for one of the benefits Berkeley&rsquo;s climate offers that 
the Northeast can&rsquo;t&mdash;winter flowering trees. A fair number of 
evergreen trees thrive in Berkeley and bloom in the late winter or early 
spring, which can come as early as February in some years. Eucalyptus, acacia 
and melalucas are all good examples. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In contrast, there&rsquo;s no major &ldquo;Fall color&rdquo; tree commonly 
planted in Berkeley that also bursts forth with blossoms right when we most 
need them, in the first three or four months of the year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This is not to say I&rsquo;m against some Fall color on Berkeley&rsquo;s 
streets and in her front yards. Liquid ambers and gingkos are, from my 
perspective, welcome stalwarts of Berkeley&rsquo;s color scene, reliably 
providing brilliant reds, oranges, and yellows at this time of year. Some 
smaller trees such as Japanese maples also provide beautiful color.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> These are great on some streets and as accents, but they and their gaudy 
cousins shouldn&rsquo;t be everywhere. Berkeley&rsquo;s not Boston. Color me 
winter green. Most of the time, at least. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2> St. Paul&rsquo;s Celebrates 70th Anniversary </h2> <i>By JAVACIA N. 
HARRIS Special to the Planet</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> &ldquo;Let your hair down, roll your sleeves up and let&rsquo;s praise the 
Lord,&rdquo; Rev. Allen L. Williams told his congregation at St. Paul African 
Methodist Episcopal Church. Williams had a special reason to rejoice. Last 
Sunday, he and churchgoers celebrated St. Paul&rsquo;s 70th anniversary in 
Berkeley. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to have history when you can look back and see 
what God has done,&rdquo; Williams said to the Sunday morning worshipers.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> The African American Episcopal Church has 7,000 congregations in more than 
30 nations, according to the AME Church website, but only one site in 
Berkeley&mdash;St. Paul. It&rsquo;s a distinction that is a source of pride to 
many of its members. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Today St. Paul has almost 1,000 members who gather to worship in its $1.5 
million sanctuary. But 70 years ago St. Paul was a very different place. Called 
the Berkeley Mission, the church began with just five members in a modest 
building at the corner of Grove and Russell streets. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> By 1935 the church boasted more than 70 members and the following year 
moved into a larger building at 1630 Fairview St. In 1937, the church received 
official incorporation from the African Methodist Episcopal church and became 
St. Paul. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In 1953, St. Paul moved to its current location at 2024 Ashby Ave. and in 
1995 a wing was added to the church to accommodate a growing congregation and 
multiple community outreach programs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Many of St. Paul&rsquo;s members, like Sarah Robinson, have been a part of 
the church for decades. Robinson has been a member for 29 years. She said that 
while St. Paul has seen different pastors and different members, different 
locations and different music over the years, no matter how St. Paul changes, 
she&rsquo;s not going anywhere. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I am dedicated to this church,&rdquo; Robinson said. &ldquo;This is 
my church.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Doris Tabor, 85, echoed Robinson&rsquo;s sentiment. Tabor has been a 
member of St. Paul since 1943, and is known around the church as &ldquo;Granma 
Tabor.&rdquo; In her Ward Street home in Berkeley, Tabor has boxes of old 
pictures and yellowed programs from services that date back as far as the 
1960s. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Tabor said she has never once thought about leaving St. Paul. &ldquo;It 
has been a haven,&rdquo; she said, adding that St. Paul gives people a chance 
to worship God through self-expression.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> At St. Paul, self-expression often means singing and dancing. On the 
church&rsquo;s 70th anniversary, St. Paul members worshiped God throughout the 
Sunday service with music and movement.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad 
in it,&rdquo; the choir sang as churchgoers stood to their feet and clapped 
their hands. Dancers moved through the aisles dressed in black leotards and 
long skirts with their waists wrapped in Afro-centric fabric.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But St. Paul members are quick to make it known that their church is not 
just about singing, dancing and preaching on Sunday mornings. Doris Floyd, 
Tabor&rsquo;s daughter and a lifelong member of St. Paul, said they are proud 
of their church mostly because of what it has meant to the Berkeley 
community.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just do our work within our walls,&rdquo; said 
Floyd, who works as the church&rsquo;s public-relations officer. &ldquo;Patting 
ourselves on the back about what we did in the church just won&rsquo;t do 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In a proclamation of recognition that Berkeley gave to the church on 
Sunday, city officials praised St. Paul for feeding 5,000 people each year 
through its Tuesday Community Feeding Program, a service that gives free meals 
to the hungry and homeless in Berkeley. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Part of the AME creed is to feed the hungry,&rdquo; Floyd 
said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> According to the official website for the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, the AME church was started in the late 1700s. The first congregation, 
Bethel, was started in Philadelphia and led by a former slave, pastor Richard 
Allen, from Delaware. Allen and others began organizing the church after 
officials at St. George&rsquo;s Methodist Episcopal Church didn&rsquo;t allow 
blacks to participate in services. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The AME Church has about two million members today. Some of the AME 
Church&rsquo;s missions include &ldquo;feeding the hungry,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;clothing the naked&rdquo; and &ldquo;housing the homeless.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Floyd said St. Paul is also committed to helping youth in the community. 
For example, in the late 1980s, after some members noticed that some black 
students in Berkeley city schools were not performing well on standardized 
tests, St. Paul developed a Saturday school program that offered free tutoring 
to students in various subjects, including mathematics and language. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Our kids were slipping through the cracks,&rdquo; Floyd said. The 
program continued through the 1990s until the church began to develop other 
education programs like the Academic Center for Excellence. This program, which 
St. Paul runs through a partnership with the University of California Office of 
the President, aims to prepare high school students for college, Floyd 
said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Our youth are our most precious commodity,&rdquo; Floyd said.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Floyd said St. Paul is even taking on issues that have traditionally been 
considered taboo in the church. St. Paul has a Teen Pregnancy Prevention/Teen 
Parenting program that works on preventing teen pregnancy by teaching 
abstinence through health education and programs that seek to build 
self-esteem. The program also offers help for teen parents. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;The church is not there to condemn people for whatever choices they 
make,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;But we are here to be an education 
center.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> St. Paul also has an HIV/AIDS Awareness program and hosts a Narcotics 
Anonymous group that meets every Saturday, Floyd said. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;In St. Paul there has always been a willing spirit to help,&rdquo; 
Floyd said. She added, however, that St. Paul&rsquo;s commitment to outreach is 
one that has evolved over time. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve moved more toward meeting the needs of the 
community,&rdquo; she said. And to meet those needs, Floyd said, St. Paul has 
had to become more contemporary in various areas&mdash;even down to the type of 
music played during Sunday morning services. Floyd said services at St. Paul 
have traditionally been more quiet and subdued. But now, St. Paul has a music 
ministry that has musicians who play everything from the flute and saxophone to 
drums and bass.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Granma Tabor said sometimes she wishes the choir would sing more 
traditional hymns like the ones she grew up singing. &ldquo;But everybody wants 
to move,&rdquo; she said of the church&rsquo;s younger generation of members, 
who want more upbeat music. &ldquo;I have to remind myself not to be jealous 
just because I can&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; she said laughing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Tabor said she doesn&rsquo;t really mind the changes, because she knows 
they&rsquo;re necessary to keep the church alive. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> One change that Tabor is excited about is St. Paul&rsquo;s newly appointed 
pastor. Tabor got up extra early on the morning of Nov. 16, the day Williams 
gave his first sermon as St. Paul&rsquo;s pastor.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;My body felt like it was a cushion and my aches felt they was 
pins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I just wanted to be there when Reverend 
Williams came back for his first service.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Becoming pastor of St. Paul was a sort of homecoming for Williams, who 
attended the church when he was a young boy while his father, E.P. Williams, 
served as pastor in the early 1960s.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Tabor said she&rsquo;s delighted to see Williams follow in his 
father&rsquo;s footsteps and feels that with his return, great and new things 
are going to happen in the church. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Last week Williams was busy visiting the sick, preparing for the 
church&rsquo;s annual revival and anniversary celebration and planning a trip 
back to Kansas City to complete his move from that city to Berkeley. Yet he 
still managed to kick off St. Paul&rsquo;s new radio ministry. The Abundant 
Light Radio Ministry will broadcast on KYDA 1190 AM on Saturdays from 10:30 to 
11 a.m. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Williams said he hopes listeners will be inspired by the Saturday 
broadcast and motivated to visit St. Paul the following morning. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Floyd said this is just one example of how Williams plans to increase St. 
Paul&rsquo;s community outreach. She said he also plans to develop a program to 
help find permanent housing for the homeless individuals that the church 
serves. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> On Sunday, Williams asked his congregation to pray for him and his family 
and be patient as he gets settled in his new role. He said he might do some 
things differently from former pastors such as the order of service. Williams 
and his congregation seemed to stumble through parts of the service, unsure if 
the collection of tithes and offering was to come before church announcements 
or not. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Will you bear with me?&rdquo; Williams asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; 
the congregations answered in unison. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I promise it won&rsquo;t be uncomfortable for long,&rdquo; Williams 
said and then urged the crowd to be excited about what the future holds. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; Williams said to Sunday&rsquo;s crowd &ldquo;that 
the best is yet to come.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<h2> Jutta&rsquo;s Makes an Art of Floral Tributes </h2> <i>By Becky 
O&rsquo;Malley</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> Berkeley is home to many unique small businesses started by people from 
all over the world who came to California, liked what they found, and stayed. 
We&rsquo;re an international city, and many of our retail stores mirror the 
countries their owners came from.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Jutta&rsquo;s Flowers, on Claremont Avenue next to the Star Grocery, is a 
perfect example of how the process works. Jutta Singh first came to Delano, 
California, as a high school exchange student from Berlin. She was thrilled by 
the wide open spaces there, quite different from Europe, and resolved to come 
back sometime and make her home here.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Back in Berlin, she got the dream job of showing international visitors 
her city&rsquo;s many cultural attractions, but she never forgot California. 
When she returned for a high school reunion, she met the man who became her 
husband and eventually became a Californian herself. The flower shop she 
started will celebrate its twentieth anniversary on Dec. 9.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Especially in the pre-Christmas season, the store reminds people 
who&rsquo;ve been to Germany of that country&rsquo;s elegant florists, which 
carry not only cut flowers but plants, pots, and many small entertaining 
decorative objects. Jutta dedicates a whole room to her extensive holiday 
offerings, including the wonderful blown glass animals on her Christmas tree, 
from which part of the proceeds go to the National Wildlife Federation.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> From Germany, there&rsquo;s a full orchestra of tiny angels playing 
musical instruments of all kinds, reflecting Jutta&rsquo;s passion for 
classical music. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> She and her associate Todd Itokazu construct extraordinary bouquets for 
presentation to soloists who appear with the Berkeley Symphony. Maestro Kent 
Nagano frequently programs unusual compositions by modern composers, often 
world premieres. If Jutta&rsquo;s not familiar with the composer&rsquo;s work, 
she reads up on it and listens to it, so that the bouquet can symbolize what 
the piece expresses. For example, a bouquet for a piece about Bluebeard 
featured twisting branches and flowers representing dangling locks and chains. 
For an organ soloist, she built an organ out of plant &ldquo;horse tails&rdquo; 
with a flower called Buddha&rsquo;s fingers reaching inside. Jutta emphasizes 
that her artistic floral tributes are based on deep emotional appreciation of 
the music. &ldquo;Unless I feel it, I can&rsquo;t connect with it,&rdquo; she 
says. &nbsp;</p>

<h2> Cooper&rsquo;s Hawks Bring City a Touch of Wildness </h2> <i>By JOE EATON 
Special to the Planet</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> It&rsquo;s happened more than once, but I&rsquo;m still not used to it: 
looking down from my dining room window as a Cooper&rsquo;s hawk flies up the 
driveway. The driveway seems to be a transit corridor, part of the bird&rsquo;s 
(or birds&rsquo;) hunting territory. The effect&mdash;a feathered projectile 
hurtling past the kitchen window&mdash;would be even more startling from ground 
level.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We think of hawks as creatures of the wild, but some have adapted handily 
to city life. Urban areas can serve as breeding or wintering grounds for 
them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I first discovered the local pair of Coopers nesting in a venerable elm a 
few blocks away. I was concerned for them when the elm succumbed to disease and 
was taken down, but the hawks relocated to a sweetgum around the corner. 
I&rsquo;ve also had a plausible report of a pair nesting south of the UC 
campus, and others may be around. Their nests are easy to spot in winter, until 
the trees leaf out and give the hawks some privacy while they incubate their 
eggs and rear their young. But you can still watch the traffic in and out of 
the nest tree, and listen to the adults&rsquo; nasal &ldquo;Kek kek kek&rdquo; 
calls.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Cooper&rsquo;s hawks are the midsize model of the trio of North American 
accipiters, about crow-sized; smaller than the northern goshawk, larger than 
the oddly-named sharp-shinned hawk. The Cooper in question was a 19th century 
naturalist, co-founder of the New York Lyceum of Natural History. To 
traditionalist falconers, these three species would be true hawks (as opposed 
to falcons, buzzards, harriers). They&rsquo;re specialist bird hunters, built 
for close pursuit of mobile targets in woods and thickets: long-tailed, 
short-winged avian fighter planes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Splendid birds that they are, I&rsquo;ll admit to some ambivalence about 
having Cooper&rsquo;s hawks in the neighborhood. Since they prey on other 
birds, I&rsquo;d wondered if I was in fact provisioning a hawk-feeder when I 
put out seed for the songbirds in my yard. Coopers can handle sizable prey like 
pheasants, crows, teal, even smaller raptors. But wouldn&rsquo;t they also take 
advantage of the smorgasbord of finches and sparrows attracted to bird 
feeders?&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A recent study by biologists Timothy Roth III and Steven Lima, published 
in The Condor (the journal of the Cooper Ornithological Society, a group named 
for the son of the hawk&rsquo;s namesake) suggests the story is more 
complicated than that. Roth and Lima set out to document what kind of prey 
Cooper&rsquo;s hawks hunted in an urban setting, and how they went about it. 
Their study area was Terre Haute, Indiana, which, dissimilar as it may be to 
Berkeley in most respects, does sustain its own population of wintering 
hawks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Roth and Lima live-trapped 13 Cooper&rsquo;s hawks during two successive 
seasons and rigged them with radio transmitters. The devices had 
position-sensitive mercury switches that signaled whether a hawk was perched in 
its normal upright posture, waiting for something to happen, or in a horizontal 
pose as it plucked and ate whatever it had killed. The researchers shadowed the 
hawks daily until early spring and reported that the birds &ldquo;were 
unperturbed by the presence of humans in vehicles or other urban 
disturbances.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The hawks turned out to have two main hunting modes. Sometimes they waited 
in ambush until a smaller bird got within close striking range. But they also 
used what Roth and Lima called &ldquo;contour-hugging attacks,&rdquo; flying a 
few feet above the ground and using buildings, fences, and vegetation to cover 
their approach to stationary prey, with a final burst of speed as they came in 
for the kill. It sounds like this is what&rsquo;s going on with the hawks that 
use my driveway.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The birds in the study often lost visual contact with their targets during 
these broken-field runs, but seemed to know where they were headed. And the 
chase was not always triggered by sight of the quarry: Four hawks staged 
surprise attacks on empty feeders, which must have been productive in the past. 
It appears the hawks were using fairly sophisticated mental maps to maneuver 
through their territories.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As for what they were after, the Terre Haute Cooper&rsquo;s hawks 
concentrated on starlings, mourning doves, and feral pigeons. These three 
species constituted 95 percent of the hawks&rsquo; targets. Although 
ubiquitous, house sparrows tended to be ignored. Sex has some effect on prey 
size, though. As in many raptors, female Coopers are larger than males. The one 
male in the study did go after the occasional sparrow, but seemed to prefer 
bigger game. Roth and Lima suggest that the small fry were just not worth the 
effort it would have taken to catch them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> That&rsquo;s the Cooper&rsquo;s, though. Its smaller cousin, the 
sharpshin, takes proportionally smaller prey, and is a definite threat to 
sparrow-sized birds. But Coopers seem to exclude sharpshins from their hunting 
territories; only a few sharpies were observed in the Terre Haute study, most 
at the periphery of the Coopers&rsquo; turf. This seems prudent on the smaller 
hawks&rsquo; part. Coopers, remember, will prey on other raptors. To a big 
female Cooper&rsquo;s, a small male sharpshin would look a lot like lunch.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> So if you&rsquo;re within the cruising range of one of Berkeley&rsquo;s 
resident Cooper&rsquo;s hawks, you should be able to keep stocking your feeders 
without too much guilt about turning your backyard finches into hawk bait. In 
an indirect way, the small birds may actually benefit from the predators&rsquo; 
presence.</p> <br>

<h2> UC-owned Hotel Raises Tax Issues </h2> <i>By MATTHEW ARTZ</i> <i>Friday 
November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> UC Berkeley&rsquo;s planned downtown hotel and convention center is part 
of a growing trend for UC campuses that lure cities with the promise of big tax 
revenues. But in at least one case, university ownership delivered exactly the 
opposite.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The trend itself is clear. In Davis, a similar development is in the 
planning stages, while in San Diego a new hotel and convention center will open 
next year and in Santa Cruz the university assumed control of a Holiday Inn two 
years ago.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The projects arise from the desire of the universities to profit from 
their steady streams of visitors and the demand for conference space and the 
hunger for cities to snare room tax money from university land usually exempt 
from local tax rolls.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A downtown Berkeley hotel offers the city&rsquo;s cash-starved government 
the chance for lucrative 12 percent transient occupancy tax revenues, which 
Mayor Tom Bates estimates could run as high as $1 million annually. The city 
also stands to collect possessory interest taxes&mdash;a poorer sister to the 
property taxes that the university, as a state entity, doesn&rsquo;t have to 
pay. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> According to the university&rsquo;s own projections of an average room 
price of $130 and a 65 percent occupancy rate in 2006, the hotel would generate 
roughly $730,080 in hotel taxes its first year of operation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Other UC developments offer cities the same revenue streams, but the money 
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily materialize.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Santa Cruz offers the worst case scenario, where UCSC signed a long-term 
lease on a Holiday Inn Hotel. But instead of renting rooms to visiting parents 
or alums, the university turned most of it into student housing. Since the 
students live there for more than 30 consecutive days, they aren&rsquo;t 
considered transients and the city doesn&rsquo;t collect the taxes they 
received from guests during the building&rsquo;s Holiday Inn-carnation.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve certainly lost about $200,000 in revenue,&rdquo; said 
Santa Cruz Finance Director David Culver, adding that the hotel brought in as 
much as $500,000 in taxes for the city in 2000 at the tail end of the economic 
boom.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> After prolonged negotiations, UCSC eventually paid the city $75,000 to 
mitigate the lost revenues, he added.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But Davis City Manager Jim Antonen complimented UC for addressing his 
city&rsquo;s concerns. Since the planned hotel will be just outside city limits 
on county land, the university agreed to downsize the project to lessen the 
potential loss to Davis&rsquo; hotel tax revenues. Davis and Yolo County 
officials are currently negotiating a split of hotel tax revenue from the 
project.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> UC Berkeley Senior Planner and Project Manager Kevin Hufferd said the 
Santa Cruz scenario wouldn&rsquo;t happen in Berkeley. &ldquo;We want this to 
serve the short-term visiting needs of scholars and family members,&rdquo; he 
said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Berkeley development would replace the Bank of America branch at the 
corner of Shattuck Avenue and Center Street with a 200-room hotel/convention 
center, including 15,000 square feet of conference space, a 5,000-square-foot 
bank and underground parking. The estimated $200 million project would be 
financed in conjunction with a private developer and could be completed as soon 
as 2007.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Additionally, in the second phase of the project, UC would pay to move the 
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley Art Museum and Phoebe Hearst Anthropology Museum 
to UC-owned buildings just east of the hotel development. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> While a precedent has been set for cities to collect occupancy tax revenue 
from university-owned hotels, property taxes usually remain out of reach.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Weldon Smith, a supervisor in the Alameda County Assessors Office, said 
the downtown hotel would be exempt from property taxes, but as a moneymaking 
venture, the complex would have to pay a less cumbersome possesory interest tax 
that taxes the owner on investment income, and not a fixed rate based on the 
value of the property.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The longer the lease and the more valuable the property improvements, the 
closer the possesory tax would approach the standard property tax, Smith 
said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Some state universities have opted to voluntarily place their hotels on 
the tax rolls. Jim Purdum, general manager of Pennsylvania State 
University-owned Penn Stater, a hotel and conference center in State College, 
Penn., said the university had agreed to pay full taxes to &ldquo;mitigate the 
burden for the city.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Culver said Santa Cruz won a ruling from the Santa Cruz County Assessor to 
keep the former Holiday Inn hotel on the tax rolls despite the UCSC 
takeover.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Berkeley City Attorney Manuela Albuquerque said through a spokesperson 
that her office was reviewing both hotel tax and property tax law to determine 
the city&rsquo;s legal rights.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Meanwhile Hufferd insisted that the hotel would not offer special deals to 
university groups that could diminish the city&rsquo;s hotel tax revenue. 
&ldquo;This will be a hopefully affordable market rate hotel,&rdquo; he said.

<h2> Newest Shelter Helps The Young Homeless </h2> <i>By JAKOB SCHILLER</i> <i>
Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> &ldquo;The first time you sleep on the streets you become obnoxiously ill 
within two weeks. It happens to everyone,&rdquo; said Marz, one of the many 
young transients who consistently line Telegraph Avenue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Marz, who has been on the Berkeley streets for six months, had his sick 
spell and says he&rsquo;s now developed immunities. Nonetheless, he says, 
it&rsquo;s become increasingly difficult to survive as the temperature drops 
and the rain starts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It might not sound like much, but this year Marz has an escape&mdash;at 
least for part of the year&mdash;at a new shelter called YEAH!, which stands 
for Youth Emergency Assistance Hostel. Now in it&rsquo;s second year, YEAH! is 
a new shelter established specifically to house people ages 18-25 who need 
overnight shelter during the winter months.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Funded in part by the City of Berkeley and staffed by a crew of over 75 
volunteers, the shelter opens Dec. 1 at the Lutheran Church of the Cross, 1744 
University Ave. Services include overnight shelter from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., along 
with snacks, breakfast, and physical and mental health programs. There are two 
separate facilities, one for single women and children, the other co-ed.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> YEAH! Executive Director Sharon Hawkins Leyden, a Licensed Clinical Social 
Worker, says the shelter fills a need for many of Berkeley&rsquo;s homeless 
youth who have refused to stay at other shelters around the area, which they 
say are overrun by other groups.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;[The other shelters] are usually a little too rowdy and smelly and 
insane,&rdquo; said Marz. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just a little nuts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Youths complain that the other shelters are often filled with the mentally 
disabled and the drugged-out.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Around here, a lot of times the older homeless people, not to 
stereotype them, are on some very hard-core drugs,&rdquo; said Sean, who has 
been on the streets of Berkeley for seven months. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to 
deal with them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> YEAH! also provides another perk certain to attract younger people in 
need. The shelter will allow animals, usually forbidden at the other 
shelters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We know that the youth are really attached to their animals,&rdquo; 
said Leyden. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want them to be a barrier.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Leyden said last year&rsquo;s shelter was so successful that they were 
able to re-open this year with even more support, though with an estimated 
budget of $60,000 they&rsquo;re still short $25,000. If they get all their 
funding, she said, they&rsquo;ll be open seven days a week through March.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> In the meantime, thanks to a number of large grants, including a $15,000 
contribution from the City of Berkeley, they&rsquo;ll operate at full scale 
until more money comes in&mdash;at least through most of the coldest months. 
Operating at full capacity, each bed costs $13 a night, much less than other 
emergency programs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Last year&rsquo;s program prompted the Berkeley chief of police to write a 
letter thanking the shelter for their help in eliminating one of the 
city&rsquo;s largest and most residual problems. And several Telegraph Avenue 
vendors told Leyden they&rsquo;d noticed a decline in the numbers of transients 
on the street.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Leyden says the center also functions as an intermediary to help their 
clients get back on their feet during one of the hardest parts of the year. 
Because they don&rsquo;t have to worry about finding shelter each night, they 
can spend their days looking for jobs and other programs to help them find more 
permanent housing&mdash;and for young homeless parents to send their children 
to school.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Marz says he&rsquo;ll head to the shelter once it opens. In the meantime, 
he says, he&rsquo;s been sleeping behind buildings and doing his best to stay 
healthy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Joining him at YEAH! may be Jen and Jose, who have been sleeping in their 
car. Both say they&rsquo;ve caught pneumonia sleeping on the streets and 
welcomed a chance to stay at the shelter, especially because they can bring 
their pooch.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Jane Micallef, a Community Services Specialist with the City of Berkeley, 
said there will be other emergency options for those who can&rsquo;t stay at 
YEAH! &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Options include the shelter at the old Army Base in West Oakland, which 
has 50 beds reserved for people from Berkeley. Micallef said the city pays for 
BART tickets to the West Oakland station and provides a shuttle from there to 
the shelter. Open since Nov. 10, the facility provides both a general occupancy 
area and a reserved area for families or people with disabilities. The facility 
is co-sponsored by the City of Berkeley, City of Oakland and Alameda 
County.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The city also provides a motel voucher program for families in need. 
Budgeted at $45,000, the program provides between five and six families with a 
room every night at a cost of about $60 per room.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Micallef says the additional programs are useful for emergency use, but 
are only a partial fix for the city&rsquo;s long-running homelessness 
problem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Other programs, including the Berkeley Food and Housing Project, continue 
to run year-round food and housing projects and conduct emergency services, 
such as coat and blanket drives.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> People interested in volunteering or making tax deductible donations to 
YEAH! Can contact Sharon Hawkins Leyden at 848-1424. For more information on 
other emergency and existing shelters services, contact Jane Micallef with the 
City of Berkeley.</p> <br>

<h2> University Avenue Plan Stalled for Eight Years </h2> <i>By ANDREW BECKER 
Special to the Planet</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: This is the first of a two-part series on the 
University Avenue strategic plan. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When Berkeley merchants and residents sat down with city officials to hash 
out a vision for University Avenue eight years ago, it was supposed to be a 
break with history.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Known for being strong on planning but weak on action, the City of 
Berkeley wanted to create a strategic plan it could actually implement. The 
city was willing to pay the price&mdash;the hundreds of thousands of dollars 
spent as consultants, residents, merchants and property owners met with city 
staff over the next two years.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> What they envisioned was a place where people could safely stroll 
sidewalks and shop in attractive, prosperous stores. Buildings weren&rsquo;t 
more than two or three stories tall except in highly concentrated 
&ldquo;nodes&rdquo; where a four-story maximum of retail and affordable housing 
existed. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Though many thought the final product was a good thing, since City Council 
adopted the University Avenue Strategic Plan in November 1996, implementation 
has dragged, residents and city officials agree. And what has been 
built&mdash;Acton Court, for example&mdash;is not what the city had in mind, 
said Councilmember Linda Maio.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> All it takes is a trip down the avenue to see that many buildings still 
need a makeover. Traffic whizzes by empty storefronts on a thoroughfare 
that&rsquo;s still heavily car-oriented, still relatively anonymous.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As Maio and others point out, state housing law allowing greater density 
to bolster financially viable affordable housing development has hamstrung the 
city&rsquo;s plans. But the central failure, others say, is Berkeley&rsquo;s 
inability to rezone. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> And running beneath all of it, say some residents and Planning 
Commissioner Gene Poschman, is an ongoing debate about housing in Berkeley. On 
one side is the city&rsquo;s Planning Department, supporting dense &ldquo;Smart 
Growth&rdquo; intended to preserve open space on the urban fringe. On the other 
side are residents who want housing that maintains neighborhood character.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Despite a recent request by the City Council for a progress report due in 
January and a commentary in the Berkeley Daily Planet in which Maio and Mayor 
Tom Bates called for zoning regulation changes to implement the University 
Avenue Plan, residents are frustrated by what they call a lack of leadership. 
They&rsquo;re also concerned about what they consider oversized buildings 
dominating the corridor, which runs west from Oxford Street to Interstate 80 
and is bounded by Delaware Street to the north and Allston Way to the south. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;All the lip service is there, but there isn&rsquo;t a lot of 
follow-through right now,&rdquo; said Robin Kibby, 30, who has lived in the 
University Avenue corridor for seven years. &ldquo;One picture is being 
painted, but the buildings we&rsquo;re getting are completely 
different.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The reason, said Dave Fogarty, who oversees the University Avenue corridor 
for the city&rsquo;s Office of Economic Development, is simple: &ldquo;The city 
did not implement the plan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;There are two sides to this. One side is the failure to do what 
could have been done. The other side is approving a plan that had so many 
complicated, expensive implementation measures that it was never possible to 
implement it anyway,&rdquo; Fogarty said. &ldquo;But because it sounded good on 
paper, the city went ahead with it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> For merchant Jay Ifshin, whose Ifshin Violins music store has been a 
University Avenue fixture for over two decades, the city&rsquo;s failure to 
implement the plan is more than a source of frustration. He said he is tired of 
the city treating the corridor as a dumping ground for what more vocal 
neighborhoods don&rsquo;t want. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;No one wants low-income housing in their neighborhood, so it gets 
dumped on University Avenue,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> What&rsquo;s left for the corridor, he said, are buildings that are 
&ldquo;junky and funky&rdquo; or far beyond the scope and size of the 
neighborhood&mdash;and lack of parking keeps strong, anchor away. &ldquo;If the 
mayor and councilmembers have to write to the newspaper [about getting the plan 
implemented,] what are we supposed to do?&rdquo; asked Ifshin. 
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Oh, yeah, we should implement this 
thing.&rsquo; Well, do it already. They&rsquo;ve spent eight years dinking 
around with the thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Thomas Myers, acting manager of Berkeley&rsquo;s Office of Economic 
Development, said much has already been done on University Avenue. The city has 
rebuilt the median strips along the avenue and is now completing the 
landscaping. Crime reduction was a major focus of the strategic plan, and 
conditions improved starting in the late 1990s&mdash;though that have resulted 
more from the overall state of the economy than any city efforts, he said.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> One of the plan&rsquo;s six goals is to implement crime tracking along the 
University Avenue corridor. But the police department still hasn&rsquo;t 
answered the question planners asked of it: What does crime along the corridor 
look like and how does it compare to previous years?&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The police are starting to work on their share of the report to City 
Council, said Berkeley Police Sgt. Steve Odom. The department has already 
completed some crime analysis along the corridor, but the report now in the 
works will scrutinize the corridor as a whole.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Although residents want more small community-oriented business, Myers 
said, it&rsquo;s difficult to attract them because of inflated lease rates and 
property values. Moreover, matching grants for capital improvements have dried 
up the past couple of years, following the recession. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;There have been dramatic changes in the community and the economy 
since [the plan was adopted,]&rdquo; Myers said. &ldquo;Funding amounts have 
changed since then. I think what the city can afford to put in they have been 
able to put in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When the plan was adopted in 1996, the Planning Commission created a 
subcommittee to supervise implementation&mdash;but when the commission 
membership changed, the plan fell by the wayside, Fogarty said. Planning for 
South Berkeley, West Berkeley and the city&rsquo;s General Plan emerged as more 
pressing concerns, said Planning Commissioner Rob Wrenn, the former chair of 
the commission.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Maio and other city officials said that the plan has taken so long to 
implement because of staff turnover and the plan&rsquo;s magnitude. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;What happened [with the strategic plan] happens often in 
Berkeley,&rdquo; said Deputy Planning Director Wendy Cosin. 
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much enthusiasm on working on new plans, [but] we 
don&rsquo;t have enough staff to work on new plans and do implementation of new 
plans. It&rsquo;s a matter of determining priorities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Part Two, Friday: Housing density &mdash; who says what&rsquo;s best for 
Berkeley&nbsp;</p>

<h2> Famed Berkeley Home Hosts Kucinich E-campaign </h2> <i>By RICHARD 
BRENNEMAN</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> When Henry Poole met Dennis Kucinich last May, politics fused with passion 
and technological savvy. What emerged from the meeting was an electronic 
presidential campaign, run in part from a room in a house that was once 
Berkeley&rsquo;s best-known radical commune.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve created the basic technological infrastructure for a 
national campaign, an online fund-raising system, e-mail, and the software for 
e-mail campaigns,&rdquo; Poole says.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Among his creations are Kucinich&rsquo;s campaign website, 
www.denniskucinich.us, his electronic bulletin board, us.denniskucinich.us, and 
a WIKI&mdash;a site each user can edit, alter, or otherwise contribute 
to&mdash;www.civicactions.org.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> While the city on the Bay is a long way in time and space from the 
Oklahoma plains where Poole was born 40 years ago, politics was in his blood 
from the start.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;My mother teaches philosophy and religion at University of Science 
and Arts of Oklahoma,&rdquo; he explains, a liberal arts college 40 miles south 
of Oklahoma City.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Back in the 60s, Oklahoma was going through some of the same 
political upheaval that was happening everywhere else in the country, so the 
conservatives decided to get rid of the hippies by sending them to the liberal 
arts college there,&rdquo; he explains with a warm smile.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;The political environment changed and they fired all the 
professors, so a bunch of them&mdash;including my mother&mdash;organized a 
legal battle and fought to get their jobs back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> While political activism came from his mother, an understanding of the 
intrusive nature of the system came from his father, a private investigator. 
&ldquo;That woke me up about the lack of privacy we all have,&rdquo; he 
says.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In Oklahoma&mdash;a state never known as a vibrant hub of 
culture&mdash;the bright youth with the unconventional parents sought solace in 
technology.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I was interested in software and abstractions, so I got into 
programming at 14 as an escape form small town thinking. I got very comfortable 
with the machine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It wasn&rsquo;t long before he blended his outsider&rsquo;s passion for 
connection with his technological gifts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really working on trying to open up communications and 
create an infrastructure for building up decentralized communities,&rdquo; he 
explains. &ldquo;That takes various forms. With technology you can bring light 
and connections to people who think they&rsquo;re alone, so that once 
they&rsquo;re together they realize they can have power.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Arriving in Berkeley five years ago, he found a grand old house on Ashby 
Avenue that only later he discovered had once been home to the city&rsquo;s 
notorious Red Family commune&mdash;the hotbed of revolution presided over by 
Chicago 7 radical and later Democratic state legislator Tom Hayden.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Poole&rsquo;s revolutionary impulses follow a gentler course. Now 40, 
he&rsquo;s a longtime member and current boardmember of the Free Software 
Foundation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge group of people working around the country 
on free software, which is a very important issue,&rdquo; he says, quiet 
enthusiasm evident in his voice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Technology controls so much of our lives, and it&rsquo;s not 
healthy to have it all controlled by a few powerful corporations.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> It was Catherine Fitts, a professional collaborator and fellow activist, 
who introduced Poole to Herman Gear, Kucinich&rsquo;s campaign architect.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Through our e-mail discussion, I learned that Kucinich was going to 
be in San Francisco in May, so we went to his town hall meeting on the 24th and 
I heard him speak. I liked what I heard, but I had a question, so I went up 
afterwards and asked him. We started talking and we got along really well. Then 
he asked if I could help him with his web campaign. I started working with 
Steve Cobble, his campaign strategist who&rsquo;d had the same role for 
Nader.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The weblog was up and running within two weeks, and the Wiki followed soon 
afterwards.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really been an amazing thing to see the 
response.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Poole cites the supporter who, after he used the web to announce a 
cross-country walk in support of the candidate, was soon joined by four others, 
who are now going door-to-door in New York recruiting votes for their 
candidate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The electronic campaigner isn&rsquo;t discouraged by media portrayals of 
Cleveland congressman as an outsider with little chance of winning the 
Democratic nomination.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;The media&rsquo;s corrupt. From my personal experiences, when 
people see this man, they experience a sense of hope that wasn&rsquo;t there 
before. They become very supportive, unshakable.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Besides, we don&rsquo;t need that much time. Look at the 
Governator. Arnold Schwarzenegger took over sixth largest economy in the world 
in a campaign that lasted just six weeks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Yeah, Dennis is a long shot, but I&rsquo;m willing to take a long 
shot. I don&rsquo;t think the planet will sustain itself if we don&rsquo;t make 
a radical change. We need someone we can trust, who doesn&rsquo;t put corporate 
interests above human rights. I have two young kids, and I&rsquo;d hate to see 
us lose half our planet before they&rsquo;re in their twenties. As it is, both 
parties put corporate interests above human rights.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;All my friends who are progressive voters tell me they are more 
aligned with Dennis than Howard Dean, but they say they&rsquo;re putting their 
energy into Dean because they think he&rsquo;s electable. In this country, so 
many people are voting against someone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Poole says the Democrats won&rsquo;t be able to pick a candidate until the 
convention, and &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot going to happen between now and 
then. He&rsquo;s the only candidate with an exit strategy for the war, the only 
one with a real grasp of what&rsquo;s happening to the environment. Those 
things might begin to resonate in the next few months, and people could decide 
they want their civil rights back, that they&rsquo;re not willing to give them 
up to become the aggressors of the planet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Whatever happens in the election, Poole&rsquo;s not about to give up. 
Another project he&rsquo;s working on with Catherine Fitts&mdash;a former 
Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton 
Administration&mdash;is whereisthemoney.org.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Based on a 2000 audit of the Defense Department that revealed the Pentagon 
has a billion dollars a year in unaccounted transaction, the site shows how 
that money could be used to fund education, children&rsquo;s healthcare and 
other programs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Poole&rsquo;s particularly fascinated with Wikis (the word&rsquo;s an 
Hawaiian term meaning &ldquo;quickie&rdquo;), the increasingly popular 
user-built website, of which the best known is Wikipedia.com, an encyclopedia 
written entirely by website visitors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think people would go online and trash the sites, but 
they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s really amazing. And hopeful.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So the house once famous for psychedelics and revolutionary politics is 
hosting another revolution, more sober and less inflammatory perhaps, but no 
less challenging for all that.</p> <br>

<h2> Grad Instructors Plan Strike Right Before Finals </h2> <i>By Matthew Artz
</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> UC Berkeley student instructors plan to strike the week of Dec. 1, just 
before final exams&mdash;potentially leaving students without last-minute 
instruction or final grades.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> United Auto Workers Local 2865, which represents approximately 13,000 
University of California student teachers, graders and tutors (ASEs), most of 
them graduate students, called for the system-wide strike Monday, claiming the 
administration has bargained in bad faith.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Three university unions&mdash;the Coalition of University Employees (CUE), 
the California Nurses Association (CNA) and the University Professional and 
Technical Employees, (UPTE-CWA)&mdash;have called for sympathy strikes, 
creating still more logistical problems for the university.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> UC Berkeley spokeswoman Carol Hyman said administrators were working on 
contingency plans, but refused to speculate on potential impacts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In October, student instructors staged a hastily planned walkout, catching 
other university unions and many of its own members off guard and away from 
picket lines. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be better organized for sure,&rdquo; said UAW Local 
spokesperson Rajan Mehta, adding that strikers planned to place a picket line 
outside the Tang Health Center so &ldquo;nurses will have something not to 
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> ASEs have been without a contract since Oct. 1 and negotiations conducted 
by a state mediator broke down two weeks ago over university demands that the 
union pledge not to engage in future sympathy strikes. No talks are scheduled 
before the end of the semester.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Mehta said the strike would last through finals, though ASEs would return 
to work for the spring semester in January even without a new deal.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Striking at the end of the semester poses extra pains for students. Mehta 
said striking instructors would refrain from offering review sessions and 
proctoring and wouldn&rsquo;t grade final exams.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Asked about the timing of the strike, Mehta blamed the university and said 
the interests of the union&rsquo;s members had to come first. &ldquo;We realize 
students will be hurt by this, but the university has continued to break the 
law and put this on themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Just how many ASEs plan to honor picket lines remains unclear. Typically, 
humanities students who receive less independent funding than science students 
are more likely to strike. Mehta insisted that more than half of UC 
Berkeley&rsquo;s 2,200 ASEs honored picket lines in October&mdash;though the 
university estimated that number at fewer than 50 percent.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> To prepare for the planned strike, UC Berkeley Provost Paul Gray asked 
professors to hold review sessions that striking GSIs would have conducted and 
to collect course grade information before the work stoppage begins.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Professors were also informed that in the case of a strike they would have 
greater latitude to alter the format of a test. If they are unable to assign 
grades by the semester&rsquo;s end, professors may give students either a mark 
of &lsquo;In Progress (IP) or an option to accept a pass/fail grade, according 
to an e-mail from Chair of the Committee on Courses of Instruction John Bishop 
posted on the UC Berkeley website.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> For classes taught by a striking graduate student instructor, the 
department chair will determine the type of grade given. Grades must be 
submitted by three days after the test, or Jan. 5 for professors with more than 
50 students in a class.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Of the three unions pledging sympathy strikes, CUE, the university&rsquo;s 
largest union representing approximately 2,800 UC Berkeley clerical workers, 
appears most likely to exacerbate logistical difficulties stemming from the 
planned student instructor strike.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;A lot of our folks have roles scheduling finals and finding rooms 
for finals, so there could be a lot problems for the university,&rdquo; said 
CUE President Claudia Horning.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> UAW Local 2865, like other UC unions, has accused the university of 
negotiating in bad faith, maintaining that UC sends negotiators to the 
bargaining table who don&rsquo;t have authority to reach a deal, a claim the 
university rejects.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The UAW has filed numerous unfair labor practice charges against the 
university, which they insist gives them the right to strike despite neither 
side declaring an impasse. The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) will 
ultimately settle the charges. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> ASE&rsquo;s receive a minimum of $14,200 for a nine-month work year as 
well as health benefits and student fee waivers for those listed as working 25 
percent of their time on instruction&mdash;among the better packages in public 
education according to UC Spokesperson Paul Schwartz.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Neither side would discuss contract details, but Mehta said that the 
sticking point remained a university demand that that the UAW agrees to a 
stipulation barring them from participating in sympathy strikes. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The university holds that current labor contract language prohibits such 
actions, but the issue remains a legal gray area, so the school has demanded 
that other unions follow the example of university lecturers who earlier this 
year agreed to contract language baring sympathy strikes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Student instructors also walked out before finals in 1992. Published 
accounts of the ensuing six-week strike reported that strikers divided over 
whether or not to give students grades, with many acquiescing to the 
university&rsquo;s urgings and others giving out marks of &ldquo;In 
Progress&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> UC Berkeley undergraduate students seemed miffed at the timing of the 
strike.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We rely a lot on graduate students to learn the material,&rdquo; 
said UC Berkeley Senior Megan Thornton. &ldquo;That could actually affect how 
some students perform on their final.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<h2> Council Sounds Death Knell for Parcel Tax Vote </h2> <i>By J. DOUGLAS 
ALLEN-TAYLOR</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> Berkeley City Council quietly put the lid on the coffin of the parcel tax 
Tuesday night, voting 5-2 to keep it off the March 2004 ballot.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But while that decision was no surprise&mdash;coming, as it did, a day 
after Mayor Tom Bates announced plans to withdraw support for his own 
proposal&mdash;Bates unexpectedly took the opportunity to accuse the Berkeley 
Firefighters Local of reneging on an earlier indication that they were 
supporting the parcel tax.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In the meantime, City Manager Phil Kamlarz announced that he would present 
preliminary plans to close Berkeley&rsquo;s budget deficit at Council&rsquo;s 
Dec. 16 meeting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Council passed a broad budget crisis recovery strategy proposal 
co-sponsored by Bates and councilmembers Gordon Wozniak, Linda Maio, and Miriam 
Hawley that calls for such belt-tightening measures as a &ldquo;hard hiring 
freeze&rdquo; for city employees and a moratorium on all new city 
expenditures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Council also directed City Attorney Manuela Albuquerque to investigate 
whether Berkeley should join in a lawsuit against Gov. Schwarzenegger for 
lowering the state Vehicle License Fee (VLF). Money collected by the Department 
of Motor Vehicles from the VLF has been distributed to California cities and 
counties, all of which expect to take a huge financial hit from the 
governor&rsquo;s action.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Bates said that both San Diego and Santa Clara counties have announced 
lawsuits against the State of California for the governor&rsquo;s actions, 
while the California League of Cities is also considering similar action.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> At the same meeting, Council voted to place all of the electoral change 
measures on the March 2004 ballot, including adding filing fees and/or 
signature requirements to run for office in Berkeley, lowering the percentage 
needed for a candidate to win, lengthening the time between elections and 
runoffs, and authorizing Council to adopt Instant Runoff Voting in the city 
once it becomes legally and economically feasible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Councilmember Hawley made a last-minute&mdash;and somewhat 
half-hearted&mdash;effort to save the March parcel tax measure, arguing that 
City Council &ldquo;has an obligation to the people of this community to let 
them vote on their options. If we don&rsquo;t put it on the ballot, we are 
going to have to cut a lot of services, and there will be no community voice in 
that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The proposed parcel tax would have made up for something less than half of 
what has been estimated to be a $15 million to $20 million city budget deficit 
within five years. Budget cuts will now have to take care of the entire 
deficit.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Taking aim at community statements against the proposed tax, many of which 
were expressed at City Council&rsquo;s one and only public hearing on the 
measure last week, Hawley said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t really gauge the support 
or lack of support for a measure by the people who come to a single public 
hearing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Only Councilmember Maude Shirek supported Hawley&rsquo;s efforts to keep 
the parcel tax on the March ballot, while Dona Spring and Kriss Worthington, 
abstained. Councilmembers Wozniak and Maio expressed concern that the tax 
measure couldn&rsquo;t pass without a major campaign effort, and neither one 
said they could imagine how such a campaign could now be generated, given the 
depth of community opposition.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;A good campaign needs volunteers who are pretty passionate about 
the topic,&rdquo; Maio said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them lining 
up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Councilmember Betty Olds agreed, calling it &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; to put 
the parcel tax measure on the ballot. &ldquo;Mim [Hawley] is an 
optimist,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish I could share her enthusiasm. But if a 
mule is kicked in the head enough, he suddenly wises up. Frankly, all those 
folks that Mim says are for it, I haven&rsquo;t encountered them. To put it on 
the voters and to spend all that money...If anybody read the Daily Planet 
today, that&rsquo;s the kind of publicity we&rsquo;re going to have all through 
the campaign. And it&rsquo;s quite effective, frankly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But it was the mayor who was most disinclined to keep the parcel tax 
alive.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;When our firefighters turned around and said &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t 
support it,&rsquo; I mean, come on,&rdquo; Bates said, exasperated. &ldquo;All 
the people in the opposition have to do is say, &lsquo;Look, even the people 
you&rsquo;re going to fund are not for it.&rsquo; The logic says we we&rsquo;re 
blown out of the water.&rdquo; The parcel tax would have been earmarked 
entirely for fire services in Berkeley.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Bates also questioned both the timing of the firefighters&rsquo; decision 
to oppose the tax, as well as the union local&rsquo;s contention that they had 
not been formally informed by city officials that the tax would be set aside 
for the fire department.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Staff met with the firefighters a month ago,&rdquo; the mayor said, 
&ldquo;described what was going on, explained to them what was going on. 
They&rsquo;re in favor of it. And suddenly, at the last minute, they pull the 
rug out from under us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Bates also said that the firefighters opposed the tax &ldquo;for reasons 
that are not totally clear to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A day after the mayor said he was unwilling to consider renewing the 
parcel tax sometime down the road after March of next year, he left the door 
open again. &ldquo;Elections are like trains,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be another one before we know it. He could not do so, 
however, without using the opportunity to take a swipe at critics of the tax 
measure.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to prove to those people who stood up 
here before the Council and said &lsquo;You tighten your belts. You do the job 
and we&rsquo;ll support you in any kind of a tax measure,&rsquo;&rdquo; he 
said. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re going to do that, and we&rsquo;ll call them on it. 
If they&rsquo;re really for real and not just demagogues, and are really 
interested in seeing the benefit of the city, they&rsquo;ll see that 
we&rsquo;ve really tightened the belt and they&rsquo;ll help us with this 
problem.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<h2> Agenda Panel Move a Teapot Tempest? </h2> <i>By J. DOUGLAS ALLEN-TAYLOR
</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> An aide to Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates says that a proposal to funnel all 
city commission reports through the City Council Agenda Committee is not as 
far-reaching as rumor appears to have it, and probably won&rsquo;t be put into 
place &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s going to be controversial.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Last week, the Daily Planet received queries about possible plans by the 
Agenda Committee to review all commission reports before they land on City 
Council&rsquo;s agenda. Currently, commission reports are automatically placed 
directly on the Council agenda after being examined by the city manager&rsquo;s 
office for fiscal impact and the manager&rsquo;s recommendation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Agenda Committee, originally known as the Rules Committee, manages the 
agenda for Berkeley City Council. Created by Mayor Bates as part of his program 
to modify Council rules and policies after his election last November, the 
committee triggered some initial controversy on City Council.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Membership consists of the mayor and two councilmembers he appointed, 
Linda Maio and Miriam Hawley.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Reports from Berkeley&rsquo;s 23 citizen commissions can be controversial 
themselves. Earlier this year, after Council deeply split over a resolution 
from the Peace and Justice Commission to investigate the Middle East death of 
American peace worker Rachel Corrie, both Bates and Hawley expressed concern 
about such &ldquo;non-Berkeley&rdquo; issues coming before the Council.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> But Bates aide Cisco De Vries says that while a commission report proposal 
was discussed during the Nov. 10 Agenda Committee meeting, they didn&rsquo;t 
intend to censor the commissions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;There has been some discussion about having commission stuff come 
through the Agenda Committee,&rdquo; De Vries said, &ldquo;but in a pretty 
limited way.&rdquo; Noting that the discussions occurred during a six-month 
review of the Agenda Committee, De Vries said one proposal would give the 
Agenda Committee the ability to move an individual commission report from the 
Consent Calendar&mdash;which is passed with no individual discussion&mdash;to 
the Action Calendar, where questions or debate occur.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> De Vries added that the Agenda Committee may want to look at either 
speeding up placement of commission reports on the Council agenda, or delaying 
it &ldquo;by no more than one week&rdquo; for the purpose of coordination with 
other action being taken by Council.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Council and Agenda Committee member Linda Maio agreed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;What was discussed last week was the possibility of the Agenda 
Committee being able to hold a report over for a week if it looks as if 
there&rsquo;s a commission report that was incomplete and questions needed to 
be answered,&rdquo; Maio said. She called that &ldquo;really, a rare 
occurrence. I don&rsquo;t think anyone [on the Agenda Committee] has any 
plans&mdash;I certainly don&rsquo;t&mdash;to hold any reports back from the 
Council. The Agenda Committee hasn&rsquo;t held anything back. What it&rsquo;s 
done is given us a little bit of time to get questions answered about agenda 
items beforehand, so we don&rsquo;t have to ask them during the night of the 
Council meeting. I don&rsquo;t see [the Agenda Committee]&mdash;and I 
don&rsquo;t know of anyone else who sees it&mdash;as being 
obstructionist.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Maio said she didn&rsquo;t see any reason why the Agenda Committee would 
hold over a commission report for more than a week.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just one out of three people [on the 
committee],&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is going to be 
discussed [at the next committee meeting].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> At least one commission member was not mollified. Told about the Agenda 
Committee proposal regarding commission reports, Planning Commission 
Chairperson Zelda Bronstein said that &ldquo;before any such proposal is taken 
to City Council for discussion, any changes in procedures in how commission 
reports come before Council ought to be first presented to the commissions 
themselves. To my knowledge, the commissions have not yet been given the 
opportunity to discuss this proposal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Bronstein declined further comment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The commission report proposal and other suggested changes to Agenda 
Committee procedures are scheduled to be discussed by the Agenda Committee 
again Dec. 1.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Agenda Committee meets at 2:30 p.m. on the sixth floor of City Hall. 
An information report for the Agenda Committee proposed changes is scheduled to 
be presented to City Council at Council&rsquo;s Dec. 9 meeting. Council itself 
must make the final decision on any proposed changes.</p> <br>

<h2> Oakland Police Chase Once Again Ends in Mayhem </h2> <i>J. DOUGLAS 
ALLEN-TAYLOR</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> So we&rsquo;ve had another 
drunk-driving-police-chase-&ldquo;sideshow&rdquo; automobile injury accident 
out in East Oakland. How many, now? One loses count.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The bare facts, as far as they can be pieced together from newspaper 
accounts, is that 52-year-old Oakland janitor Juan Martinez was critically 
injured last Saturday night when the car in which he was driving on 98th Avenue 
in Brookfield Village was struck by a car driven by 27-year-old Randolph Brown. 
Injury accidents happen all the time in cities, with little notice. This one 
rated an article in both the San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland 
Tribune&mdash;as well as a column in the Berkeley Daily Planet&mdash;because of 
the incidents preceding.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In both the Chronicle and the Tribune stories, the California Highway 
Patrol have been cruising the Oakland streets of late to help Oakland police 
crackdown on &ldquo;sideshow&rdquo; activities. East 
Oakland&mdash;International Boulevard, especially&mdash;has been something of a 
police state of late, with CHP cars cruising up and down the nighttime streets. 
Come out here on the weekend, and you can see them pulling drivers from the 
Fruitvale District to the San Leandro border.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We&rsquo;d been told that the CHP had been called in by Oakland officials 
to help out with Oakland&rsquo;s soaring murder rate, but maybe that&rsquo;s 
what they&rsquo;re doing, on the sly. Stop a thousand cars in East Oakland, 
after all, and the odds are you&rsquo;ve got to come up with at least one that 
contains a driver (or a passenger) who might consider shooting somebody, 
somewhere, sometime in their life.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Anyway, the Chronicle and the Tribune agree that CHP officers spotted 
Brown spinning donuts in his Mustang at 73rd and Bancroft. Both papers implied 
that there was a &ldquo;sideshow&rdquo; going on, though never saying so 
explicitly, and the Chronicle article also included a helpful explanation of 
&ldquo;sideshow&rdquo; activity for readers west of the Bay not familiar with 
the practice: They occur (according to the Chronicle) &ldquo;when drivers rev 
their engines and wage spinning contests to the delight of crowds that can 
number in the hundreds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Was there a &ldquo;spinning contest&rdquo; going on at 73rd and Bancroft 
on Saturday night? Were there hundreds of people out in a crowd, there, 
watching? Or was Mr. Brown simply out there spinning a donut on his own (which 
East Oaklanders have been doing for a couple of decades, by the way, most often 
unrelated to what people define as sideshows)? On this point, both newspapers 
are silent.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In any event, both newspapers agree that when he saw the Highway Patrol 
officers, Mr. Brown sped away. The CHP &ldquo;briefly gave chase (according to 
the Chronicle) but CHP supervisors quickly called off the pursuit because it 
was too dangerous on city streets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Officers saw Mr. Brown&rsquo;s Mustang again at 87th and International 
&ldquo;but again Brown took off at speeds exceeding 70 mph (according to the 
Chronicle, again) and the pursuit was dropped (again according to CHP 
officials). Just two minutes later, officers (Which officers? The same ones who 
originally saw Mr. Brown at 73rd and Bancroft? One is left to 
speculate&hellip;) encountered the accident scene on 98th Avenue near 
Interstate 880, authorities said.&rdquo; The Tribune gives the last moments 
before the crash a slightly different take, saying that the CHP officers 
&ldquo;canceled the pursuit at 98th Avenue and San Leandro Street.&rdquo; For 
those of you unfamiliar with Brookfield Village, that is within easy walking 
distance&mdash;almost within sight, in fact, though it&rsquo;s around a bit of 
a curve&mdash;of the accident scene at Denslowe and 98th.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In any event, Mr. Brown was arrested by officers at the accident, and 
charged with felony drunk driving.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This has become a ghastly familiar story out here in this end of Oakland. 
We have three distinct problems that often get interrelated&mdash;by the 
police, the public, and the press. One is drinking and driving. One is 
high-speed police auto chases. One is the spinning of donuts in an automobile 
in the middle of an intersection.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The dangers of drinking and driving need not be explained to the average 
American adult. Despite our best efforts, we have not gotten it in to the heads 
of many of our friends and neighbors that the two are a deadly mixture. How 
many die from drunk driving accidents in a year? Look it up yourself. 
It&rsquo;s an enormous problem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> High-speed, injury-accident police auto chases are a growing concern in 
this country. Several police chases resulting in horrific traffic deaths 
recently shocked the City of Los Angeles, which is not easily shocked. In 
response, the L.A. City Council instituted a temporary ban on police chases for 
minor traffic violations. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> And then we have the Oakland practice of spinning donuts in a car in the 
middle of an intersection. Noisy and annoying, yes. Maybe a little dangerous, 
too. But according to Oakland Police Chief Richard Word&mdash;a man not given 
to public falsehoods&mdash;the spinning of donuts has not directly caused a 
single death in this city. The only deaths have occurred after drivers have 
raced away from police rolling up on the events. And which one of these three 
problems, do you think, does the City of Oakland consider so dangerous that 
upon it must be instituted a continuing crackdown? Donuts, of course.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Priorities. Priorities. </p> <br>

<h2> Police Raise Funds To Donate Holiday Meals </h2> <i>By MATTHEW ARTZ</i> 
<i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> The officer slipped out of his black-and-white police cruiser and strode 
up to a South Berkeley home. In his mouth, a caramel, sour apple lollipop, in 
his hands a 10-pound oven-stuffer turkey.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Needless to say, the woman of the house was happy to see him. &ldquo;This 
is a blessing for me,&rdquo; Ruby Evans said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to have a 
nice holiday when you can&rsquo;t afford a turkey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On Tuesday, Berkeley Police, for the nineteenth consecutive year, put the 
service back into &ldquo;To Protect and Serve,&rdquo; handing out 250 
Thanksgiving dinners to families in need throughout Berkeley&mdash;all earned 
by the blood, sweat and quadriceps of 11 officers on bikes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;This is the best day of the year,&rdquo; said Lt. Bruce Agnew, who, 
along with Sgt. Alec Boga, founded the annual BPD Turkey Ride in 1994&mdash;a 
three-day, 216-mile September journey to South Lake Tahoe that raises money to 
feed Berkeley families on Thanksgiving and Christmas.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It&rsquo;s a long way from the winding mountain roads of the Sierras to 
the Public Safety building, where by 7 a.m. Tuesday about 60 volunteers 
including city workers, Berkeley Boosters, and high school students formed a 
half-block long assembly line, stuffing boxes with yams, onions, bread, canned 
food, stuffing and marshmallows to compliment the main course.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The meals were enough to feed eight, with the fixings paid for by the 
$8,000 raised by the 11 bike riders from the Berkeley and UC Berkeley police 
departments and the turkeys donated by Safeway. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Berkeley beat officers nominate the recipients, who are reviewed by the 
department&rsquo;s Special Enforcement Unit to ensure that everyone is 
deserving.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Going door-to-door can sometimes give police more than just a sense of 
satisfaction.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Capt. Bobby Miller who has ridden on 16 of the 19 rides recalled one house 
several years ago where he found three young children &ldquo;totally 
neglected,&rdquo; while their mother &ldquo;partied with her new 
boyfriend.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> He sent Child Protective Services to remove the children for a few weeks, 
and came back around to check up after they returned. &ldquo;I felt fortunate 
to know that the Turkey Ride had made life better for three small 
children,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Tuesday&rsquo;s scene was especially gratifying for the cyclists who got 
off to a tough start on this year&rsquo;s ride. Before they made it to 
Martinez, retired Lt. Tom Grant tumbled from his bike, opening a gash on his 
leg that needed stitches. Later that day, a Ford Probe sideswiped Lt. Agnew, 
knocking off the car&rsquo;s sideview mirror and bruising his hip. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Officers must use vacation time to cover the ride, and they pay the $125 
expenses out of their own pockets, but it&rsquo;s all worth it when they get to 
hand out the meals.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to drive up in a police car and give something to 
somebody,&rdquo; Agnew said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not something we get to usually 
do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> And it&rsquo;s much appreciated. &ldquo;That they go through the trouble 
to do all that work and drive the turkey here, that&rsquo;s a beautiful 
thing,&rdquo; Evans said.</p> <br>

<h2> Letters to the Editor </h2> <i></i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> EXCITING POTENTIAL&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The hotel and convention center proposed by UC and the mayor of Berkeley 
holds exciting potential for downtown Berkeley. I read both the article 
(&ldquo;Mayor, University Set Downtown Hotel Plan,&rdquo; Daily Planet, Nov. 
21-24&rdquo;) and the letter by Steve Geller with interest. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Kriss Worthington was quoted as saying it could be a wonderful 
contribution or a horrendous nightmare. If, as suggested in the article, the 
transformation includes museums, and, as mentioned by Dona Spring, daylighting 
of Strawberry Creek, it could be phenomenal. If parking is foregone, in favor 
of demonstrating how well public transit can serve such a center, it could be a 
bold, world-class vision and model. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The site&rsquo;s yard-stick proximity to the downtown BART station, and 
frequent service by AC Transit make it is easy to see how a relationship 
between local transit, the hotel and it&rsquo;s visitors would be readily 
established. Bus passes and BART tickets could be dispensed right at the 
center, along with a kiosk of clear transit information, resources and popular 
Bay Area destinations. Visitors could be educated and inspired by their 
Berkeley experience when they return home.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The image of a &ldquo;babbling brook,&rdquo; mentioned by Steve Geller in 
his letter, on the hotel grounds, and Center Street restaurants being creek 
side is an oasis-like mirage in this metropolitan area. And it wouldn&rsquo;t 
be a phony Las Vegas-like water &ldquo;feature.&rdquo; It would be a natural 
feature long covered by a busy street. This would truly be a retreat. The 
opportunity is too good to pass up. The university and the future developer 
could be recognized as visionaries world-wide, if it was designed with green 
principles built in; not just in the building materials, but how the hotel and 
convention center is operated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Now, when I juxtapose that image with a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;conventional&rdquo; hotel and convention center with underground 
parking, I lose hope, get discouraged and want to stay away. Far away. If a 
parking lot is built with no thought or encouragement given toward transit, it 
will be another car-culture frenzy. The thought of the increase in car volume 
resulting from this potential underground parking lot is unbearable. As it is, 
I bicycle, BART or walk downtown. How anyone could plan to build such a huge 
structure downtown Berkeley in the image of the car-dominant paradigm is beyond 
me. Thinking must be done outside the box for this one, or the downtown 
environment will be destroyed by car culture.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Here&rsquo;s another perspective: One underground parking space costs 
$40,000! How many parking spaces will be needed? Besides the $40k per space, 
what cost would there be to the environment from pollutants? To the health of 
pedestrians? To the dining pleasure of the cafe patrons across the street? What 
would underground parking do to the creek? What would the creek do to 
underground parking? &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Imagine if that money were spent to educate and promote available transit 
to travelers. Imagine if that money were invested to improve transit and to 
daylight the creek! What if the money were invested in a local shuttle? What if 
all downtown travelers benefited from this diversion of parking money, so that 
transit improved for everyone, and downtown automobile congestion decreased 
overall as a result of this project? &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I know details are yet to be worked out, but I hope that in Berkeley, we 
can work together to create a vision to be emulated elsewhere; a cutting-edge 
environment for hotel and convention-goers. Building parking spaces is the 
no-brainer, default position. This new project can help solve the traffic 
congestion problems downtown, not add to them. The challenge would be to create 
a model vision, a pedestrian oasis and retreat for business travelers, tourists 
and the rest of us. &nbsp;</p>

letters to the editor for the flame-out of the deceptive parcel tax

<p>ROLLING BACK THE CLOCK&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I was stunned at Tuesday night&rsquo;s Berkeley City Council meeting when 
Councilman Gordon Wosniak, in a 12-minute attack against IRV, suggested that 
had IRV been in effect when Abraham Lincoln ran against Stephen Douglas, 
Douglas would have won.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> What he failed to mention was that women and blacks were not allowed to 
vote. Is this councilman suggesting we roll back to the days when only white 
male landowners have the right to vote?&nbsp;</p>

<p>GIVING IT AWAY&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In a Nov. 25 letter, Steve Geller praises UC&rsquo;s proposed 
hotel/convention/museum megaplex on Center Street. But he wants to omit its 
underground garage, bring Strawberry Creek to the surface, and close off Center 
Street as a &ldquo;pedestrian mall.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I think most Berkeley residents would agree that these preferences are 
precisely upside-down. In particular:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> First, UC absolutely must conserve its printing press building at Center 
and Oxford, even if it&rsquo;s reused to house the museums. This is a 
significant Art Deco structure&mdash;and the U.N. Charter was printed there. 
Its destruction would represent an irreplaceable loss of history.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Second, the underground garage is essential: UC must replace the parking 
it would remove by destroying its Addison/Oxford parking structure. And it must 
provide parking for the new traffic that its megaplex would generate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Third, it&rsquo;s time for city leaders to finally drive a silver stake 
through the unworkable notion of &ldquo;daylighting&rdquo; Strawberry Creek. 
This would be an unimaginably costly, disruptive, and uncertain undertaking for 
a city government that is (a) broke and (b) incapable of keeping even small 
public works projects within schedules or budgets.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> At best, it would open the creek to fast food waste and toxic runoff. 
Creek fans should go see Strawberry Creek upstream on the UC campus (where it 
runs above ground for everyone&rsquo;s enjoyment).&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Note how much trash the creek suffers even in this sheltered environment. 
Let&rsquo;s hear a plan to better clean up and protect the creek&rsquo;s 
exposed portion&mdash;not to endanger its safe underground stretch.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Fourth, closing off Center Street should also be forever forgotten. Center 
Street is a transit corridor, a gateway to the UC campus, and an essential 
pressure-relief valve for a downtown that&rsquo;s already too congested.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Finally, UC should not own the hotel property&mdash;Mr. Geller seems to 
agree with me here&mdash;and the hotel should rise no higher than the Downtown 
Plan&rsquo;s allowed five to seven stories. UC ownership would deny the city 
important property tax revenue. And UC&rsquo;s exemption from local zoning 
would deny the public any control over the parcel&rsquo;s future 
development.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Let&rsquo;s hope city officials have finally learned their lesson from 
UC&rsquo;s past encroachments elsewhere. It&rsquo;s time to take our city 
back&mdash;not give more of it away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>WISHFUL THINKING&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Steve Geller&rsquo;s letter (&ldquo;Planning Ahead,&rdquo; Daily Planet, 
Nov. 25-27) makes some good points about the exciting new possibilities for a 
hotel, conference center, art museums, etc. in downtown Berkeley. But on one 
point he reveals some wishful thinking, shared, I&rsquo;m afraid, by too many 
of our fellow citizens.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Mr. Geller suggests that &ldquo;The conference center shouldn&rsquo;t need 
much parking...... visitors arriving by air can ride BART directly from either 
OAK or SFO.&rdquo; He thinks &ldquo;Maybe the hotel can get by with minimal 
parking.&rdquo; And he believes that in due course Berkeley residents will free 
up spaces &ldquo;by using transit instead of monthly passes. Evening restaurant 
and theater -goers will come by bus.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> If we follow through on this line of thought, I suggest we&rsquo;re in for 
a disaster. First, no one coming to a conference from Fresno, Modesto, San 
Jose, Santa Cruz, or Santa Rosa is going to fly. They&rsquo;ll drive. So will 
many from Sacramento and even Los Angeles, especially if family members are 
with them. Second, Berkeley theaters and restaurants can say goodbye to their 
patrons from Walnut Creek, Alameda, the Oakland hills, Marin County and 
countless other places if they&rsquo;re expected (especially at night) to wait 
for a dwindling, sometimes unreliable or even non-existent bus service. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p> For the past three decades I&rsquo;ve heard well-meaning people suggest 
less reliance on cars and more on public transit. During all that time, things 
have gone in the wrong direction. Transit has faced increasing challenges, 
required more and more subsidies, and been compelled to reduce service. 
Goodness knows it&rsquo;s a necessary part of our lives, but except in a few 
limited instances, public transit is never going to be a serious rival to the 
private car (least of all at night), and the sooner we realize that, the 
better. Mr. Geller lives in an urban part of town, on a major bus route. So do 
most people who prescribe the bus for others. I can only suggest they come to 
terms with the fact that cars have been around for well over a century, that 
good reasons exist for their popularity, and that regrettably, the way to a 
achieve an exciting downtown is not by wishful thinking. &nbsp;</p>

<p>ANIMAL SHELTER&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I was delighted to read that Mayor Tom Bates agrees with animal shelter 
supporters, shelter staff and members of the community that an animal shelter 
&ldquo;would be great&rdquo; on the southern portion of the two-acre site at 
Sixth and Gilman streets&mdash;the old Urban Ore site. (&ldquo;Red Tape Snares 
Animal Shelter,&rdquo; Daily Planet, Nov. 25-27).&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Those of us who always envisaged the new animal shelter there did so 
because of the high visibility without encroaching on a residential area. On 
the Council Sub Committee and at the Humane Commission, we are very aware of 
the traditional image of animal shelters as nothing more than warehouses to 
store and kill unwanted animals. Our alternate view&mdash;of an exceptionally 
well designed, landscaped, family friendly, living, community resource&mdash;is 
gaining momentum as more municipalities are taking pride in their animal 
shelters and putting in place reform policies to end the tragedy of pet 
overpopulation and high euthanasia.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I wish to correct the suggestion in the article that animal shelter 
supporters have rejected other sites for scant reason. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> One of the sites, 15 feet from the railroad tracks, was so noisy that the 
realtor suggested we put in triple glazing and keep the windows permanently 
closed. Another site is earmarked to be part of a new bike trail linking 
Emeryville and Berkeley and requires a substantial swath of the land, and the 
site on Carlton Street, west of Seventh Street near the railroad tracks, is so 
close to the Bayer plant that many people felt the proximity to a company 
engaged in live animal testing would present an image problem for the Berkeley 
animal shelter.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As to the comment attributed to me, that the land swap could have been 
accomplished with more political support, reporter Matt Artz misunderstood me. 
I told him I agreed with Mr. Cowan&rsquo;s assessment that the deal was too 
complex. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I do stand by my remark that it takes guts to put the animal shelter with 
it&rsquo;s affordable &lsquo;well-pet&rsquo; clinic where it should go&mdash;at 
Sixth and Gilman, and hope that the city will be able to craft a deal with BUSD 
to facilitate the bus yard moving elsewhere and for the animal shelter to be 
built there. It can become the centerpiece of an energized neighborhood, to the 
benefit of the local communities and every Berkeleyan. Animal shelters are part 
of our community, they enhance an area, they encourage children to learn about 
animals. In short: An animal shelter is a good neighbor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NOT OUT OF SIGHT&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I am puzzled by the claim that an animal shelter on University and Third 
Street would be &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind,&rdquo; and that this 
&ldquo;hidden location&rdquo; would mean fewer volunteers and less connection 
to the community. (&ldquo;Red Tape Snares Animal Shelter,&rdquo; Daily Planet, 
Nov. 25-27).&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Just build it with a sign on the roof that says it is the animal shelter 
and calls for volunteers. The sign would be visible to everyone using the 
University Avenue freeway entrance&mdash;and this would be one of the most 
visible buildings in Berkeley.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This is not brilliant urban design, but it is an obvious way to end the 
current impasse and get the shelter built.&nbsp;</p>

<p>VOTERS NOT STINGY&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I deeply resent Mr. Artz&rsquo;s uncalled-for editorial comment about 
&ldquo;Berkeley&rsquo;s increasingly stingy voters&rdquo; in a purported news 
story about the woes of the animal shelter. Berkeley&rsquo;s homeowners pay 
some of the highest property taxes in the state. Perhaps Mr. Artz should try 
paying property taxes on a limited income before he makes any more snide 
remarks about Berkeley voters. Maybe he should also give up trying to report 
news and confine his opinions to the editorial page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXX&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editors, Daily Planet:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In his op-ed commentary (&ldquo;Public Demands Tax Accountability For Tax 
Payments,&rdquo; Daily Planet, Nov. 21-24), John Koenigshofer again perpetuates 
the myth of thousands of &ldquo;untaxed&rdquo; Berkeley renters who don&rsquo;t 
contribute to owner property tax obligations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Also, in an earlier letter (Daily Planet, Nov. 17-20), Mr. Koenigshofer 
assails the Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board&rsquo;s annual citywide rent 
increase/adjustment process, or Annual General Adjustment (AGA), as 
&ldquo;unfair.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As a real estate industry professional associated with a Berkeley-based 
firm, I can appreciate what apparently motivates Mr. Koenigshofer&rsquo;s ad 
hominin polemical attacks against both the elected rent board&rsquo;s policies, 
and the city&rsquo;s 1980 voter-approved Rent Stabilization Ordinance, which 
regulates nearly 20,000 rent controlled units citywide.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The rent board&rsquo;s AGA calculation includes 27 separate rental 
property owner expenses, taxes, fees, utility costs, etc. To cite several 
components: During 2002-03, the Peralta Community College and East Bay Regional 
Park tax assessments both declined by&mdash;12.30 percent respectively.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> During the same period, for example, the following AGA components remained 
flat or increased: city business license (0 percent), street lighting (0 
percent), lead abatement (0 percent), insurance (1.6 percent), school bonds 
(1.6 percent) and property taxes (2 percent), to list a few items.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As required by the California Supreme Court and the city&rsquo;s rent 
ordinance, rental property owners in Berkeley are entitled to a 
constitutionally mandated &ldquo;fair return&rdquo; from their property 
investment. Accordingly, a one percent AGA rent increase (plus an additional $3 
per unit per month) was provided for all units that already receive the state 
Costa-Hawkins vacancy decontrol&mdash;or full market rent&mdash;increase (the 
average rent for these units is now $1,220 per month). &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Since 1980, AGA adjustments have kept pace with Bay Area inflation, and 
maintained the constitutionally mandated &rdquo;net operating income&rdquo; (or 
profit) level for all rent controlled units in Berkeley. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Omitted from Mr. Koenigshofer&rsquo;s letter is any mention of the years 
1990 to 1994: During that time, a real estate industry-backed rent board 
majority increased Berkeley&rsquo;s rent levels by an unprecedented 50 percent 
across the board leading to extreme hardship for many renters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If Mr. Koenigshofer feels passionately that the current rent board or the 
rent ordinance is &rdquo;unfair,&rdquo; I urge him again to devote his time and 
energy to campaigning on behalf of&mdash;and democratically 
electing&mdash;candidates who better reflect his views rather than 
complaining.&nbsp;</p>

horticulturalists. Some of the choice offerings: &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Outdoor plants:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Coreopsis giganta, Channel Island Tree Coreopsis. With its 
substantial trunk and mophead of yellow daisies, this California 
native&mdash;three feet high at maturity&mdash;would be right at home in a Dr. 
Seuss illustration. Planted right after the holidays, it will get established 
over the winter so that it&rsquo;s ready to go and grow in the spring. Drought 
tolerant. 4-inch pot, $7.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Lapageria rosea, Chilean bellflower, is the national flower of 
Chile and would make a very special gift for a true plant connoisseur. Because 
it&rsquo;s hard to propagate, it&rsquo;s hard to find in nurseries. Its flowers 
are shaped like elongated, rosy red bells about three inches long. Stunning. 
$50.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Indoor plants &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Lovely Begonia fuchsiodes sports beautiful, deep red, fuchscia-like 
flowers. $7.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Bemuse a good vegetarian friend with a gift of the carniverous, 
vaguely sinister-looking Sarracenia alata consists of a green stem, about a 
foot and a half long, that ends in a cobra shaped head. Set in water water, it 
will attract the gnats it likes to eat. Indoor/outdoor. $15-$20. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Mounted bromeliads would make lovely and unusual gifts for lovers 
of houseplants. The Botanical Garden has Tillandsias, small bromeliads that 
grow on the trunks of trees in the jungle, placed on special clay mountings 
that can be hung on the wall. $12-$20. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Rosarians (the fancy name for rose gardeners) will really 
appreciate &ldquo;The American Beauty,&rdquo; Tahoe Gloves&rsquo; long leather 
and nylon gauntlets. Unlike many other rose pruning gloves, this pair, in green 
and cream, really protects arms from the nastiest thorns and longest canes. 
$37. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Westbrae Nursery and Gift, 1271 Gilman St. 526-7606. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Metallica gazing balls reflect a garden (and its onlooker), 
inviting contemplation and providing an intriguing accent to flora and foliage 
of all sorts. Westbrae has gazing balls in silver (the most popular color 
because it provides the best reflection), gold, green, red, teal and puprle. 
12-16&rdquo; in diameter. $54-$69. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Garden gnomes got popular at Westbrae after one appeared in the 
movie Amelie. The ones at the nursery this year are imported ceramic 
reproductions of European gnomes that were originally produced in France, 
Germany or England in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 
10-12&rdquo; high. $30-$60. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Ceramic toadstools from England and from the United States add a 
beautiful touch of whimsy to a garden. Many colors and sizes. $5-$20. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &bull; Choose from a wide assortment of Buddhas and Kwan Yis (the female 
form of the Buddha of compassion), available in architectural resin, cement or 
laval rock, in varied colors. $18-$150. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &bull; Colormark&rsquo;s metal watering wands come in rainbow hues that 
recall the aluminum tumblers of the 1950s. Designed to be screwed onto a hose, 
they are made in Wisconsin and have brass fittings, an on-off shut-off valve, 
and a heavy-to-light spray feature. Parts are replaceable. 8-10&rdquo; long, 
$13; 30&rdquo; long, $25.</p> <br>

<h2> Decadent Delights Await the Chocoholic&rsquo;s Palate </h2> <i>By MARTY 
SCHIFFENBAUER Special to the Planet</i> <i>Friday November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> Getting gifts makes me miserable.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I&rsquo;ve convinced myself my aversion to the present has its roots in 
the past. Specifically, following my Bar Mitzvah, at which I received a 
half-dozen wristwatches, I had far too much time on my hands. Bar Mitzvah 
lessons no longer needed, I wound up spending my newly-freed Friday afternoons 
at the Brooklyn Public Library. And, if memory serves, it was one windy, fall 
day that I literally stumbled over Proust and my life changed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Marcel Proust was notorious for manipulating his friends through 
gift-giving. And I&rsquo;m sure it was during the hours I filled turning the 
pages of &Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu that I became acutely aware of 
the malevolent intentions of gift-givers. Undeniably, their sole purpose is to 
control the lives of the recipients of their largesse. Thus, if somebody gives 
me a sweater or a book as a gift, it&rsquo;s my gut reaction they&rsquo;re 
telling me what to wear and what to read. A pair of slippers clearly means they 
want me to walk in their shoes. A necktie with an Edward Munch 
print&mdash;could it be more obvious? They want me screaming for their love. 
Yes, evil gift-givers are conspiring to transform me from who I am to who they 
want me to be.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When I was a Berkeley tenant activist in the 1970s and 1980s, I was 
regularly the target of landlord curses and frequently found death threats left 
on my answering machine. If, instead, the landlords had showered me with gifts 
they would have quickly driven me out of town.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> These days my gift-receiving phobia isn&rsquo;t much of a problem. Mainly, 
because I hardly ever get any. Actually, there&rsquo;s only a single individual 
who persists in plying me with presumed tokens of her affection, mon 
significant amour, La C. Over the years, she&rsquo;s learned edible gifts are 
least likely to drive me up the wall. Perhaps, it&rsquo;s that my gift paranoia 
is outweighed by my free food mania. And when it comes to edible gifts, nothing 
beats chocolate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If there&rsquo;s a member of your crowd tormented by an affliction similar 
to mine, let me suggest a few chocolate delicacies to consider for holiday 
gift-giving.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chocolate Bars&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I&rsquo;ve always envied people with short last names. And, on occasion, 
have contemplated bidding hasta la vista to the latter part of my own 
polysyllabic patronym. Lately, however, Big Namen have acquired a distinct 
cachet and I&rsquo;m less discontented with my lengthy appellation. By cachet, 
I&rsquo;m thinking not so much of our Governator but of Berkeley&rsquo;s very 
own world class chocolatier, John Scharffenberger.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Scharffenberger and partner Robert Steinberg moved their doubly eponymous 
Scharffen Berger Chocolate business to Berkeley a couple of years ago and their 
pure dark chocolate rivals that fabricated by the creme de la creme of 
continental chocolatiers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Scharffen Berger chocolate bars come in various sizes and blends and are 
widely available locally, from the Elmwood Pharmacy (at Russell &amp; College, 
where I get my fix) to the company&rsquo;s factory store (914 Heinz Ave.).&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Here&rsquo;s an idea. Buy an assortment of premium European chocolate bars 
and include them in a gift basket along with Scharffen Berger selections. This 
thought in mind, I consulted my Personal Chocolate Trainer (PCT) to put 
together a list of such imports: Bernard Castelain, Valrhona and Michel Cluizel 
(France), Slitti and Venchi (Italy), Lindt, Rapunzel and Toblerone 
(Switzerland), Callebaut and Cote d&rsquo;Or (Belgium), Droste (Holland), Valor 
(Spain), Hachez (Germany), Green &amp; Black (U.K., but chocolate made in 
Italy). Of this illustrious lot, my PCT reserves her highest accolades for Cote 
d&rsquo;Or, which she claims is not just palate-pleasing but a powerful 
antidepressant (she should know, as in her spare time she&rsquo;s a 
shrink).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hot Chocolate&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Guess which is healthier for you: red wine, green tea or hot 
chocolate?&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Yup, it&rsquo;s hot chocolate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Researchers at Cornell University recently compared the three beverages 
and determined hot chocolate had almost twice the antioxidant concentration of 
red wine and two to three times the concentration of green tea. Antioxidants, 
as every Berkeley citizen has undoubtedly heard, help fight heart disease and 
cancer as well as slow aging by exterminating pesky free radicals.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Three organic, hot chocolate brands that caught my eye while browsing shop 
shelves are Dagoba, Lake Champlain and Ah!Laska. All use Fair Trade cocoa and 
Ah!Laska donates a percentage of the company&rsquo;s profits to Alaska wildlife 
organizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Another excellent choice is Ibarra&rsquo;s traditional Mexican hot 
chocolate product. Ibarra&rsquo;s cinnamon-laden chocolate discs are packaged 
in a pretty, hexagonal, red and yellow box, so you can save on gift-wrap.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> I&rsquo;d be disloyal if I didn&rsquo;t pay homage to the pride of 
Brooklyn, Fox&rsquo;s U-bet chocolate syrup. Famous as the indispensable 
chocolate egg cream ingredient, the legendary syrup is also terrific for 
concocting yummy hot chocolate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In addition, a number of chocolate bar manufacturers sell hot chocolate 
mixes. These include Scharffen Berger, Droste, Valrhona, Green &amp; Black and 
San Francisco&rsquo;s popular Ghiardelli. However, according to my PCT, the 
planet&rsquo;s preeminent hot chocolate is served at Chez Angelina Rumpelmayer 
in Paris&mdash;where Proust himself plotted his conquests. (The nearest 
supplier of authentic Angelina&rsquo;s hot chocolate mix I could find was the 
Caf&eacute; Society in Napa; 1000 Main St., (707)256-3232.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chocolate-Covered Stuff&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Decades ago I had a girlfriend who had a passion for chocolate-covered 
halvah bars&mdash;or, more precisely, she had a passion for the chocolate on 
chocolate-covered halvah bars. She&rsquo;d methodically pick the chocolate off 
the bar, joyfully ingest it, then dump the halvah into the trash. I never 
understood why consuming chocolate in this unique fashion gave my former 
girlfriend such satisfaction. But, I suppose, there are lots of things about my 
girlfriends I&rsquo;ve never understood.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Anyway, it seems the yen for stuff covered with chocolate is universal, 
from chocolate-covered matzohs to chocolate-covered crickets. And cruising 
local markets, I spotted an embarrassment of chocolate-covered riches, 
including: raisins, cranberries, cherries, strawberries, almonds, peanuts, 
pistachios, pecans, ginger, espresso beans, pretzels, malt balls and 
licorice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> And let&rsquo;s not forget the vast cookie, cracker, biscuit and biscotti 
categories, with even madeleines available chocolate-dipped. But I&rsquo;ll 
limit myself to noting a single personal addiction here: McVitie&rsquo;s 
Chocolate-covered Digestive Crackers. Imported from England, the crumbly karma 
of these British Browncoats never fails to flash me back to the American 
Revolution. No, not the one in 1770s, the one in the 1960s when I discovered 
McVitie&rsquo;s while in a transcendent state. (I rediscovered them when they 
were La C.&rsquo;s holiday gift last year.) But, beware, only McVitie&rsquo;s 
Plain Chocolate (not milk) Digestives are worth the pounds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> There are, of course, multitudes of other chocolate wonders for sale. 
You&rsquo;ve got truffles, puddings (Kozy Shack deserves kudos), brownies, ice 
cream and gelato, fudge, confections, spreads (e.g., Nutella), sauces, 
liqueurs, cigars and kisses, to list a few. Plus, there&rsquo;s your basic cut 
pieces of bulk chocolate (I&rsquo;m told the Coffee Market on Gilman Street is 
a neighborhood shop with decent bulk prices) and, not to mention, edible 
chocolate products intended to enhance creative erotic practices (e.g., check 
Good Vibrations on San Pablo Avenue.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So, use a little imagination and it should be easy to find a chocolate 
treat that won&rsquo;t trigger a tantrum in your gift-phobic recipient. And, 
with luck, you might elicit a glimmer of gratitude.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Final tips: To a chocolate snob, which I&rsquo;m rapidly becoming, milk 
chocolate is tres uncool. As for white chocolate, my PCT says it&rsquo;s fine 
if you enjoy the taste of suntan lotion. In case you don&rsquo;t catch my 
drift, dark chocolate is de rigueur!</p> <br>

<h2> Editorial: Resisting Insularity </h2> <i>Becky O'Malley</i> <i>Tuesday 
December 02, 2003</i> 
<p> Last week I had a chance to take a look at a little exhibit in the 
basement of International House, the residence hall near the UC campus where 
students from all countries live together in order to, as their web page says, 
&ldquo;foster intercultural respect and understanding, lifelong friendships and 
leadership skills for the promotion of a more tolerant and peaceful 
world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The display cases are filled with memorabilia going back almost 75 years 
since the house opened: a letter of recommendation for Canadian John Kenneth 
Galbraith, pictures of formal dances in the 40s and 50s with daringly mixed 
racial and ethnic groupings, the saga of how I-House arranged for a Japanese 
student to live a Midwestern home instead of an internment camp when she was 
marooned during World War II. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The exhibit brought back the most vivid memory I have of my first day in 
Berkeley: walking through Sather Gate and seeing an Indian woman in a sari 
coming toward me. At that moment, 18 years old, I felt that I was indeed a 
citizen of the world, even though I&rsquo;d never been farther from the U.S. 
than Tijuana. One of the continuing joys of living in Berkeley is that the 
world has always come to us. But now it seems that this could change.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Thanksgiving at our house has often included guests from other countries, 
as it did this year. But this year I was sadly conscious of the guests who 
weren&rsquo;t there: the Cambodian student who left for a short visit to his 
family and was inexplicably denied a return visa after 9/11; the Canadian opera 
singers who had to leave because they never could get working papers; the 
Israeli girl who went home to months in prison because she is a conscientious 
objector. A Parisienne at the table has been here for five years, thanks to her 
husband&rsquo;s high-tech job, but her family hasn&rsquo;t visited her. Her 
father is old, she said, and was originally from Algeria. He&rsquo;s not 
willing to risk going through U.S. visa procedures because of the stories 
he&rsquo;s heard about how foreigners, especially foreigners from 
Arabic-speaking countries, are treated in the U.S. these days. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Enrollment of international students at Cal is down since 9/11, enough to 
affect the vacancy rate for Berkeley rentals. Students report endless hassles 
from U.S. consular employees when they apply for visas, even in countries like 
China with very little logical connection to fears of terrorism. The American 
president is a man who had never left the country until he was elected, and who 
now travels isolated in military jets wearing soldier suits he hasn&rsquo;t 
even earned. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The prospect of a &ldquo;more tolerant and peaceful world&rdquo; seems 
more remote than ever. But if Japanese-American friendships survived the Second 
World War, perhaps friendships being made by students in Berkeley today will 
survive the current unpleasantness. The I-House exhibit is a touching reminder 
of what has been accomplished in 75 years, against all odds, by dedicated 
internationalists determined to rise above the periodic eruptions of national 
strife. We Berkeleyans who enjoy the rewards of living in an international 
community should continue to do as much as we can to prevent our government 
from working against these goals.&nbsp;</p>

<h2> Editorial: Berkeley Blame Game </h2> <i>Becky O'Malley</i> <i>Friday 
November 28, 2003</i> 
<p> There&rsquo;s a best-selling book with a title something like Everything I 
Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I 
learned most of what I need to know in my ninth grade English class. One 
semester of ninth grade English in my school was devoted to what we called 
&ldquo;Mythology,&rdquo; that is, the stories that the ancient Greeks and 
Romans used to explain the universe. It never fails to amaze me how often 
contemporary human behavior can be described in terms of what I can remember 
from the old stories I learned fifty years ago. People haven&rsquo;t changed 
much since ancient times.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A quick Google search reveals that publications all around the world have 
had experience with newsmakers blaming the press for reporting bad news. The 
articles on this phenomenon inevitably refer to the Greek custom of killing the 
messenger who brought the news. Berkeley&rsquo;s mayor seems not to be immune 
from this historic human tendency.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> He told the Daily Planet&rsquo;s reporter that articles about opposition 
to the proposed parcel tax were responsible for the decision not to put it on 
the March ballot. When pressed, he amended his statement to include just 
&ldquo;editorials&rdquo; and &ldquo;letters,&rdquo; not news articles per se. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> First, we here at the Planet would like to make it clear that we have 
never come out in opposition to the parcel tax, either for the March ballot or 
for the November ballot. We have, Cassandra-like, suggested in editorials that 
things were not going well for tax supporters. Our correspondents have been 
much more forthright with their opinions. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> We print almost every letter and commentary piece we get that&rsquo;s not 
completely illiterate or overwhelmingly obscene, and during the whole 
discussion of the tax proposal we received no more that two or three letters 
favoring the tax, plus a commentary from Revenue Task Force Chair Dion Aroner. 
We printed all of them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We also received and printed a lot of letters opposing the tax. Like many 
others in Berkeley who are on e-mail trees, we got even more letters from 
opponents reluctant to have their names appear in print because they feared 
(rightly or wrongly) retaliation from city officials. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The citizens of Berkeley need to pull together to solve our fiscal 
problems. Here are a few suggestions for where we should go from here:&nbsp;</p>
<p> First, having the main discussion of the revenue shortfall in the 
unpublicized venue of the Mayor&rsquo;s Revenue Task Force was a lousy idea. 
Public hearings should have been at the beginning, not at the end of the 
process. We can start, now, with more and better open public conversations 
about what&rsquo;s gone wrong. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> And this whole discussion started much too late anyway. The Santa Cruz 
city council was warned in late 2001, maybe earlier, that declining state 
revenues would require substantial cuts, so they went right to work on trying 
to figure out what to do.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Berkeley, on the other hand, went on believing that the future was rosy 
for much too long. A UC pundit, with cooperation from official sources, 
authored a glowing description of Berkeley&rsquo;s purported budget surplus 
which was widely and approvingly reprinted in the progressive press. Behind the 
scenes, among Berkeley progressives who understood what was really going on, 
that piece was greeting with much gnashing of teeth. The Daily Planet received 
first drafts of two different commentaries which attempted to set the record 
straight, from local activist writers who later withdrew the pieces, again 
because they feared political retaliation. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> City unions are getting a major share of the blame from tax opponents. 
Whether that&rsquo;s justified or not should be openly evaluated in the public 
arena. There was a very modest discussion of whether or not contracts should be 
re-negotiated, but it took place in the Council&rsquo;s afternoon rump session, 
mostly behind closed doors, with a very short public session held only after 
Councilmember Worthington insisted. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> So here we are, late in the game, with no game plan. Killing the messenger 
isn&rsquo;t going to make the crisis go away. (Don&rsquo;t even think about 
stealing this paper!) There&rsquo;s no way that the city won&rsquo;t have to go 
to local taxpayers for more money, probably in November 2004, in competition 
with the schools, who are also suffering. But between now and next November, 
let&rsquo;s talk. The pages of this paper are open to all points of view.&nbsp;
