<h2>Colorful Annuals: The Flower Garden Workhorse</h2> 
<p>I love to talk about annuals. They&rsquo;re colorful and long lasting. I 
like to call them the &ldquo;workhorses&rdquo; of the flower garden. Planted 
after the last frost in your geographical area, they will give you joy all 
season while providing shades of every color of the rainbow.</p> 
<p><strong></strong>The great thing about annual bedding plants is this year, 
you love hot orange, but last year you planted all yellow and pink, and next 
year purple might be your top choice. Annuals are an inexpensive way to change 
the curb appeal of your home and stay updated with fashion and color trends. 
It&rsquo;s a fun way to spend time with the family as you pick colors, plant 
for the season, and then watch them produce color until fall. With water, soil 
prep and a little fertilizer, it&rsquo;s very rewarding.</p> 
<p>From the dwarf zinnias to hedge-type marigolds, size and shape is up to 
you. Some plants will tolerate hot, dry sunny locations and others prefer moist 
shade. Almost every yard has a place where annuals can be planted. Your local 
florist or garden center can help with information and education on what plants 
will do best for your yard. Here are a few ideas to inspire you in choosing 
annuals:<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>Borders:</strong> lobelia, ageratum, sweet 
alyssum, dwarf marigolds, dianthus, moss rose portulaca, dusty miller</p> 
<p><strong>Mass Plantings:</strong> geraniums, petunias, marigolds, celosia, 
cosmos, phlox, vinca and gazanias</p> 
<p><strong>Tall Flowering Plants: </strong>snapdragons, cleome, nicotiana, 
salvia, gomphrena and zinnias</p> 
<p><strong>Trailing Plants: </strong>verbena, lobelia, vinca vine, sweet 
potato vine, calibrachoa, lantana, scaevola and bacopa</p> 
<p><strong>Climbing Plants:</strong> morning glory, nasturtium, black-eyed 
Susan vine and scarlet runner bean</p> 
<p><strong>Shade Lovers:</strong> impatiens, begonias, fuchsia, coleus, 
mimulus, torenia, browallia and balsa</p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>Fragrant Flowers:</strong> nicotiana, sweet 
alyssum, scented geraniums, stock, heliotrope and four o&rsquo;clocks</p> 
<p><strong>Patio Pots:</strong> spike, dahlias, calibrachoa, gerbera, 
osteospermum, bidens, geraniums, petunias, marigolds, pansy, viola, 
helichrysum, chrysanthemum daisy, New Guinea impatiens, asparagus fern, 
statice, ivy, herbs and veggies of all kinds.</p> 
<p>A few of my favorites: salpiglossis, schizanthus, nemesia and diascia.</p> 
<p>Be adventurous. There are new varieties introduced every year, along with 
new colors and textures. You are limited only by your imagination. Enjoy a 
great summer of color in the flower garden.</p> <br>

<h2>Planting Perennials and Ground Covers</h2> 
<p>During my 30 years in the garden center business, there is one question 
that is asked more than all others: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between 
an annual and a perennial?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s one of those questions that many 
are embarrassed about, because they re-ask it every year. Here is the response 
I give to help my customers remember: &ldquo;An annual is like annual taxes, 
you have to do them every year. A perennial is like a perennial problem, it 
keeps coming back, time after time.&rdquo; With that said, here are some 
powerful perennials every landscape should consider, and some great ground 
covers that are hardy, will return every year and spread, and help reduce weeds 
and soil erosion.<br>
<br>
The benefits of a well-designed perennial garden can 
provide many years of beauty and enjoyment. Early blooms of Basket of Gold 
Alyssum, to mid summer&rsquo;s Stella de Oro Daylily and Shasta Daisies, then 
finishing with fall&rsquo;s Autumn Joy Sedums, offers homeowners constant color 
throughout the season with less maintenance, less water, and often with fewer 
pest problems.</p> 
<p>Perennials may serve as natural borders along fences or property lines and 
require less irrigation and maintenance than turf grass. Visually, perennials 
give depth to property, and are a great background to soften fences and walls. 
They also are great companions to trees and shrubs and help in the resale of a 
home.&nbsp; Sunny, dry sites to moist shady spots have numerous perennials and 
ground covers that will foot the bill and thrive when properly selected for 
their location. Not to mention the main goal &mdash; curb appeal to impress 
your family, friends and neighbors. But most of all impress the folks driving 
by that say, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s a beautiful flower garden and it seems to 
stay in bloom all season!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<strong>Tips for planting perennials:
</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Choose location and blooming times</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Check plant hardiness for your neck of the woods Consider factors of sun, 
shade, wind, soil type and water source</li> 
<li>Plan it on paper, which is much easier to correct than digging plants back 
up to relocate</li> 
<li>Prepare a list of desired plants with heights and spread, blooming time 
and color</li> 
<li>Add organic matter to improve soil quality if needed to help with drainage 
and aeration</li> 
<li>Early Spring: Rock Cress, Creeping Phlox, Basket of Gold, English Daisy, 
Lily-of-the-Valley, Candytuft, Pasque Flower, Mossy Saxifrage, Hellebores, 
Violas and Sandwort</li> 
<li>Early Summer: Ajuga, Columbine, Sea Thrift, Forget-Me-Not, Sweet Woodruff, 
Iris, Dianthus, Bleeding Heart, Penstemon, Periwinkle, Flax, Snow-in-Summer and 
Peony.</li> 
<li>Summer: Snow on the Mountain, Yarrow, Holly Hock, Agastache, Astilbe, 
Carnation, Coreopsis, Ice Plant, Delphinium, Foxglove, Baby&rsquo;s Breath, 
Coral Bells, Red Hot Poker, Lavender, Shasta Daisy, Bee Balm, Poppy, Rudbeckia, 
Salvia, Daylily, Hosta and Veronica</li> 
<li>Late Summer/Fall: Coneflower, Sedums, Fall Aster, Chrysanthemum, German 
Statice, Gayfeather, Tall Garden Phlox, Russian Sage and Ornamental Grasses.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Facts for ground covers:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Helps control weeds and soil erosion</li> 
<li>Dense foliage, but some can become invasive</li> 
<li>Generally, less than 12&rdquo; tall and spread easily</li> 
<li>Plant where grass is not practical and some tolerate light foot traffic
</li> 
<li>Vines, herbaceous plants and shrubs, low growing juniper and 
ornamental&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Grasses and moss, are considered excellent groundcovers.</li> </ul> 
<p>When planting ground covers, follow the same tips as perennials.<br>
<br>

<strong>Here are a few ground cover favorites to consider:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Small areas (under 50 square feet): Woolly Yarrow, Pussytoes, Mt Atlas 
Daisy, Silver Mound Sage, Sedum, Hens and Chicks, Lamb&rsquo;s Ear, Creeping 
Thyme, Cranesbill, Creeping Speedwell and Verbena</li> 
<li>Large areas (greater 50 square feet): Poppy Mallow, Snow-In-Summer, Ice 
Plant, Strawberry, Creeping Potentilla, Rock Cotoneaster, Catmint, Moneywort, 
Ground Ivy, Japanese Spurge and Periwinkle.</li> </ul> 
<p>Enjoy your perennial wonders of nature and they&rsquo;ll reward you with 
years of colorful blooms.<br>
<br>
What&rsquo;s your favorite perennial, and 
where does it live and thrive in your garden?</p> <br>

<h2>Nature&rsquo;s Promise of Spring</h2> 
<h1><em><strong>Lady Bird Johnson said, &ldquo;Where flowers bloom, so does 
hope.&rdquo;</strong></em></h1> 
<p>&ldquo;Every year of our lives, one thing is certain, the seasons will 
change, the sun will rise and set, and the flowers will bloom.&rdquo; 
That&rsquo;s my personal quote. (Maybe someday, some young writer will quote 
me. That would be cool &hellip; sorry, I digress.)</p> 
<p>Gardeners and even non-gardeners notice the changes of our seasons, when 
the green patches of lawn peek out from a snow covered yard and the faces of 
pansies tilt upwards toward the sun on a cold late winter day. Fall planted, 
spring blooming bulbs, such as tulips, crocus and daffodils, start to emerge, 
their noses pushing through the soil. They&rsquo;ll notice the buds on tree 
branches start to swell, the buzzing of bees, and a Red Breasted Robin with a 
worm in its beak preparing for a new family. They might notice the life giving 
moisture soaking into the ground, rejuvenating shrubs and rose bushes, slowly 
warming them out of their long winters nap. The spring rain cleanses the 
winter&rsquo;s deposits from the fronds of juniper.<br>
<br>
No doubt, Spring 
is my favorite time of year. Spring is when we celebrate regrowth and new 
beginnings.</p> 
<p>Across the nation, there are times when you anticipate the next big show by 
Mother Nature. The rhododendrons in the southeast, cherry blossoms around the 
Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., the fragrant peonies on the plains of Central 
Illinois, to the golden aspens of fall in our mountains of Colorado and the 
tulips of Skagit Valley in Washington.<br>
<br>
I could make a list of all 
these extraordinary displays, and every person reading this would add a few 
more from where they grew up or live. These natural events bless us and touch 
all of our senses, from the smell of lilacs and plumeria, to the soft touch of 
pussy willows, the sight of pampas grass on a hillside waving in the wind, to 
the taste of fresh rhubarb and the sound of rustling corn stalks in a late 
summer breeze, all bring up images of nature&rsquo;s colorful bounty.</p> 
<p>It sometimes touches our very fiber of who we are and stirs up memories of 
times past and future promises.&nbsp; Nature and plants can affect our moods 
and well being. The overcast gray skies and gloomy frozen landscape of the 
Midwest can be depressing, and for some, the only cure is spring. The busy and 
sometimes hectic lives we live can be made more tolerable by just stopping and 
smelling the roses.<br>
<br>
So my wish for you this&nbsp; spring is to take a 
moment to look around at what nature has to offer. Bring branches of apple 
blossoms and forsythia indoors and let them bloom.&nbsp; Visit a tulip 
festival.&nbsp; Plant pansies and violas in a colorful pot.</p> 
<p>Take a walk with the family around your neighborhood and spy on newly 
emerging flowers. Enjoy the promise of growth and admire creation. This cycle 
started long before we showed up and will continue long after we are gone. 
Embrace and thank nature for the gift of reengergizing us each and every spring.
<br><br>
<em><strong>Which flowers and plants do you look forward to watching 
bloom every spring?</strong></em></p> <br>

<h2>Get in touch with your inner farmer...Starting Seeds Indoors</h2>  
Confucius said, &quot;if you think in terms of a year, plant a seed ; if in 
terms of ten years, plant a tree ; if in terms of a hundred years, TEACH THE 
PEOPLE. &quot;<br>
<br>
It is quite rewarding to start your seeds indoors and a 
great feeling of accomplishment. Visiting your favorite garden center and 
selecting the flowers, vegetables and herbs you'll grow for the upcoming season 
really tends to bring out your indoor farmer gene. We all had forefathers that 
were working the Earth to grow crops to feed and cloth their families. What a 
great &quot;field-trip&quot; to the greenhouse with the kids to explore what 
generation after generation did to grow their own crops and beautify their 
lives with flowers.With thousands of choices of seed packets to choose from, 
it's best to have a plan. Ask yourself a few important question. What can I 
start indoors and plant outside when weather allows? How much space do I have ? 
What does the family want to harvest in the fall ? Seed packets themselves are 
like little works of art. Great pictures of the mature plant, detailed growing 
information, facts and what to expect. This year there is a trend toward 
heirloom varieties and USDA Certified Organic seed. The bonus of picking and 
growing your own seed packets is, it's exactly what you want to grow, knowing 
no chemicals or pesticides were used in the process. You are in control of your 
own food and herb source.<br>
 Tips on how to get started and grow your seeds 
indoors:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Seeds are made up of three basic parts, (1) an embryo.(2) a supply of 
nutrients, and (3) a seed coat.</li> 
<li>Need a sunny window</li> 
<li>Important to start seeds four to eight weeks before the plant-out date in 
your area.(average date of last killing frost)</li> 
<li>Almost any container with drainage holes in the bottom (great selection at 
most mom and pop garden shops)</li> 
<li>Use a rich, well drained weed-free soil mix, many excellent pre-packaged 
are available</li> 
<li>Fill container, but do not pack soil tight</li> 
<li>Read seed pack for proper depth or any special instruction</li> 
<li>Water in with fine spray, cover with clear plastic or dome and place in a 
cool room (60-65 degrees), keep away from direct sunlight until germination.
</li> 
<li>When seeds sprout, move them gradually into sunlight. Thin plants, to 
ensure light and health.</li> 
<li>Water seedlings carefully, not too wet or too dry, this is where most 
mistakes are made</li> 
<li>About a week prior to planting outdoors, gradually expose seedlings to 
longer periods of direct sun and temps, reduce watering to harden off plants.
</li> 
<li>Prepare outdoor garden and plant when temperatures allow. </li> </ul>  For 
more info and insight check-out, Growing Plants From Seed, at 
www.ext.colostate.edu , fact sheet # 7.409, by Dr. S.E. Newman. Also, a great 
web site on seeds atwww.botanicalinterests.com , Enjoy getting in touch with

<h2>The Poinsettia...the most beautiful, misunderstood holiday plant.</h2>  
Year after year, I am told by my customers they would love to get a poinsettia, 
but they are poisonous, &quot;and I have kids and pets.&quot; THIS IS A MYTH. 
The wonderful Christmas plant (Euphorbia pulcherrima) is the most widely tested 
consumer plant on the market today, and shows NOT to be toxic to either humans 
or animals. Now, I know your Mom said, &quot; she heard &quot; they are 
poisonous. Sorry, Mom, a 1971 study at Ohio State University debunked the rumor 
that started way back in 1919 in Hawaii. The misdiagnosed death of an Army 
officers two year old child started the tale. Since, then, the Flower of the 
Holy Night has been always under the magnifying glass and has proven itself to 
be SAFE. Now, that we got that settled, let me share with you, some history, 
fun facts, care and handling. The Aztecs cultivated the poinsettia in Mexico. 
They used the bracts (modified leaves around the flower) for dyes and the latex 
to counteract fever. The plant also played a part in midwinter celebrations. 
During the 17th century, Franciscan priests near Taxco observed the plant 
blooming during the Christmas season. They incorporated the plant into Nativity 
processions. A botanist and first U.S. minister to Mexico, Joel R. Poinsett, 
sent some plants home in 1825, to South Carolina as gifts for his friends at 
the holiday season. As a result, December 12th is National Poinsettia Day and 
recognizes Poinsett's contribution to history. A national known horticultural 
family, The Ecke's of Encinitas, California were the true pioneers developing 
potted and cut-flower cultivars of this modern day plant. Their breeding 
programs focused on stronger stems, leaf and bract retention, multiple 
branching, earlier blooming and color variations - better quality plants for 
you, the consumer. Red is the most common, but many colors are now available.
<br> Select the perfect plant for you. Poinsettias do well in our homes and new 
colors and new forms are developed every year. From the mini to the topiary 
tree types, hanging baskets, centerpiece styles and standard sizes of 4&quot;, 
6&quot;, 8&quot;,10&quot; and 12&quot; pots, you'll be able to find what suits 
your needs. Choose plants with dark green, healthy looking leaves and bright 
(unfaded) bracts. The little yellow flower (cyathia) in the middle of bract 
should be tight and show a little color. And most important, if the outside 
temperature is below 40 degrees, the plant should be wrapped or sleeved before 
transporting. Poinsettias thrive on indirect, natural daylight, at least six 
hours a day. Protect plants from cold drafts or excessive heat. Keep moderately 
moist, but never allow to sit in water. No need to fertilizer while in bloom, 
but later in March a balanced all-purpose plant food should be used monthly. 
Re-flowering is a little challenging, but a fun project to try. Check out this 
&quot;Service in Action&quot; sheet written by my friend, Dr. Steven E. Newman 
and B.E. Edmunds at Colorado State University, simply called ,&quot; 
Poinsettias&quot; Number 7.412 at www.ext.colostate.edu for re-flowering 
details and further info. Now that we all are educated and excited about the 
most misunderstood plant for the Holidays, enjoy them in your home, at the 
office, and in flower arrangements. The perfect plant as a gift to family and 
friends that convey the Christmas spirit. There are a few other holiday season 
plants that are truly noteworthy, the amazing Christmas Cactus, the bulbs of 
Amaryllis and fragrant paper white narcissus. From bright red and white 
cyclamen to the little pine/spruce trees adorned with bows and ornaments, 
plants make a the perfect holiday gift that last well into the New Year. 
Enjoy...The Flower Guy !!! <br>

<h2>It's Time to plant Fall Bulbs for Spring Color!</h2> 
<p>Remember those beautiful tulips, daffodils, hyacinths and crocus that were 
blooming in the spring? Believe it or not, now is the time to plant the bulbs 
for next spring&rsquo;s bloom. You&rsquo;ll be glad you planted them. When 
those flowers emerge in the spring from their winter slumber, it is truly 
magical.&nbsp;Let me share with you a short history on tulip bulbs,&nbsp;and 
tell you about site, soil prep, selection (the fun part), planting and growing.
</p> 
<p><strong>Tulip History</strong> --- The original tulip was a wild flower 
growing in Central Asia. The Turks cultivated it or tamed it around 1000 AD. It 
was introduced to Western Europe and the Netherlands in the 17th century. Its 
name comes from the Turkish word&nbsp;for turban. A true status symbol planted 
in palace gardens.</p> 
<p>It soon gained popularity as a trading product, especially in Holland. The 
interest in the flower was huge, and bulbs sold for unbelievably high prices. 
Some hybrids and mutations of the flower were seen as rare and a sign of upper 
status. In early 1637, there was a complete &lsquo;Tulipmania&rdquo; in the 
Netherlands, where many rare&nbsp;bulbs would cost more than the average cost 
of a house at the time. The early growers and traders made huge amounts of 
money. Everyone wanted in on the action, but then, oversupply and lower demand 
caused major bankruptcies.&nbsp;This &ldquo;Tulip Crash&rdquo; caused their 
government to introduce special trading restrictions on the flower.</p> 
<p>Today, that&rsquo;s all in the past,&nbsp;the popularity of the 
tulip&nbsp;is ever present. Bold colors, shapes and sizes,&nbsp;dramatic 
flares, parrot-types, bunching varieties make this wonderful treasure both 
affordable and hugely desirable.</p> 
<p><strong>Choosing Where to Plant Bulbs&nbsp; </strong>---- Plant them in a 
highly visible bed where you, family and friends&nbsp;can see and enjoy 
them.&nbsp;Choose a spot with good sunlight and&nbsp;drainage so bulbs will not 
become waterlogged. Amend your soil with a well-decomposed compost 
or&nbsp;sphagnum peat moss, this will improve your soil texture, plus, help 
with aeration and drainage.&nbsp;Apply phosphorus fertilizer or bone meal at 
the time of planting so it is available to the roots.&nbsp;Tip: Plant a solid 
block of color because in bloom, it is truly impressive.</p> 
<p><strong>Selecting Bulbs and Planting Bulbs -</strong>--- Pick the largest 
ones because there is a direct correlation between the size of the bulb and 
size of the flower.&nbsp;Avoid those that show evidence of mold or mechanical 
damage.</p> 
<p>Check the blooming times on the bulb package; some will say, very early, 
early, mid or late. These will allow you to have a full spring and early summer 
of&nbsp;color.</p> 
<p>In my area of Colorado, the best time to plant is September-October. Be 
sure to ask your local garden center about when the best time to plant is in 
your area.</p> 
<p>Bulbs should be planted to a depth of three to four&nbsp;times the height 
of the bulbs.&nbsp;If your bulb is 2&Prime;, plant it around 6&Prime; to 
8&Prime;&nbsp;deep.&nbsp;Plant with the growing tip up. Water well after 
planting and during&nbsp;dry times when there is&nbsp;no moisture during the 
winter months.</p> 
<p><strong>Caring for Bulbs in Winter and in Spring</strong><br>
 After the 
ground freezes, add a few inches of mulch&nbsp;to prevent alternate freezing 
and thawing. During spring, remove flowers as they wither, but don&rsquo;t be 
afraid to cut some and enjoy them in vases in the home.</p> 
<p><strong>Plant Pansies, too</strong><br>
 A great addition to your bulb beds 
are pansies. Planted on the&nbsp;top of the bulb garden, it will remind you to 
give needed water in dry times and reward you with blossoms through the snow 
and winter.&nbsp;Many colors, shapes and sizes are&nbsp;available in 
fall.&nbsp;It seems the blues/purples and yellows are most hardy and prolific.
</p> 
<p>So,&nbsp;early this fall, plant these gems around your &ldquo;palace&rdquo; 
and smile to yourself&nbsp;for being so smart,&nbsp;knowing they&rsquo;ll 
reward you next&nbsp;spring.</p> 
<p><strong>Happy Gardening!</strong></p> <br>

<h2>Thinking outside the box... the window box that is! Having fun with 
colorful patio pots !</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;  In this day and age, there are so many of us that have downsized. 
Our &quot;gardening area&quot; has diminished to&nbsp;a deck, porch or small 
patio. The days of you coming home from work to a huge chore of back breaking 
weeding, dead heading, dragging the hose around and harvesting the fruits of 
our labor have been reduced to some nice planters on the deck. I personally am 
guilty and love it. I've had many homes with huge gardens, show gardens on 
tours&nbsp;and plantings of unusual and exotic flowers and plants that don't 
necessarily grow in our environment. I've learned of micro climates and 
techniques to help these plant survive. Now over 50, I've decided to scale it 
down.&nbsp;But, that certainly doesn't mean you can't have a blast gardening 
and have some very cool plants and flowers to work with, brag on&nbsp;and enjoy 
!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It all starts with looking at your location. Is it full sun, 
shade, part sun, windy, and ease of watering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking the right 
flowers for the right location is vital. &nbsp;Make sure you are paying 
attention to this. Putting shade-loving double impatiens in full sun will just 
frustrate you and defeat your goal. Planting zinnias in shade will not work. 
Now that you know your conditions, I would go to the garden center and pick out 
some cool, colorful, maybe even funky pots. Today's selection of pottery is so 
much better than years ago. Sure , we all still stock clay pots and plastic 
containers, but what a great opportunity to jazz it up with some 
neat&nbsp;brightly colored pots of different shapes and sizes. Maybe, a lime 
colored strawberry pot with dark blue lobelias trailing out, with&nbsp; purple 
gomphrenas as the focal point on top. The selections are only limited to your 
imagination.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;So now you have some cool pots, time to consider the soil. A nice 
mixture of Canadian sphagnum&nbsp;peat moss, compost,&nbsp;vermiculite, 
perilite, charcoal and a wetting agent is recommended. Good drainage is a must. 
&nbsp;Don't get nervous,&nbsp;you don't have to mix this,&nbsp;it's already in 
bags at the greenhouse ready to go, some with a&nbsp; fertilizer already mixed 
in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding some polymers in the soil, those little crystals 
that&nbsp;reduce watering and labor, will be beneficial to your plants. Ask 
your local garden center Guru for their recommendations and advise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now comes the fun part, picking out your plants. Bright 
colors, texture of foliage,&nbsp;bloom and growth&nbsp;sizes,&nbsp;trailing or 
upright, variegated, are just a few considerations. Mixed pots are as unique as 
the gardeners who plant them. You can match them or&nbsp;make them opposites, 
monochromatic or&nbsp;psychedelic. The choice is YOURS ! It's your deck, your 
the one that will be sitting back and relaxing with your margarita gazing on 
them and saying, &quot;very nice, cool flowers and oh, by the way, I designed 
and planted&nbsp;them !&quot; Have fun, experiment with new varieties and 
plants you've never used. Nice red geraniums,&nbsp;a spike in the middle, a few 
yellow marigolds and petunias&nbsp;and some trailing vinca vine in a brown 
pot&nbsp;is nice. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, safe and traditional. But, 
maybe, next time try a red banana in the middle, surrounded by hot lips salvia 
with some blue ageratum with&nbsp;fiery orange celosia and sun loving coleus of 
lime around the edge mixed with double purple calibrachoa. Did I mention, it's 
in a ceramic bright orange window box ??? Gardening shouldn't be rocket science 
and it shouldn't be hard or&nbsp;difficult, what I'd like it to be, for 
everyone is a kick, fun and funky with alot of individual style.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live on a golf course now in a patio home,&nbsp;so 
small scale gardening is a hot topic for me. My two umbrella planters on the 
tables are&nbsp;small scale golf greens, planted with Irish and Scotch moss 
surrounded with smooth pebbles, a teed up Callaway finish the look.&nbsp;Like 
I've said, &quot;you are only limited by your own imagination !&quot; Enjoy, 
The Flower Guy !&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The amazing hummingbird and the plants they love !!!</h2>  In our world of 
flowers and plants, we sometimes forget just how much Mother Nature is the boss 
in all aspects of flora and fauna. How flowers and plants and their 
relationships with us and animals affect the world around us. From fruit and 
vegetable production to erosion control, plants and animals are the essential 
part of the building blocks of life on this planet.<br>

<p>WOW, that sounds really quite heavy, but oh, so true. We need to understand 
the relationship between us and the important role that flowers, plants, bees, 
birds, bats, insects and animals play in our well being and the health of our 
world. One such character is the amazing hummingbird and relationship with the 
plants they love.</p> 
<p>Our friend, the hummingbird, can fly forward, hover and then fly backwards 
and is the only bird that can. They weigh less than a penny, fly 500 miles 
non-stop flights from Mexico and Central American and thousand more miles to 
reach their destinations. Their tiny hearts can reach 1,200 beats a minute. 
They have the highest metabolism of all animals and are always on the brink of 
starvation. Their daily search of nectar is vital and need to find and visit 
hundreds of flowers to feed. Placing out feeders certainly helps, but planting 
flowers is the best solution to helping our little friend. Hummingbirds revisit 
a route they follow year in and year out, this practice is called 
&quot;traplining.&quot; If you can help establish a garden of beautiful plants 
they will be lured to you and return. Red is their favorite color. Orange and 
purple seem a close second and third. They will hang around all summer, raise a 
few eggs and leave in the late summer or early fall. So, plan your &quot;hummer 
garden&quot; carefully with some plants I'll suggest. The huge bonus is, 
butterflies are attracted to the same plants, who could ask for more? A side 
note, the use of pesticides around our tiny friends is not cool, be safe and 
natural.</p> 
<p>Trees and shrubs they love...Azalea, butterfly bush, flowering quince, 
lantana, weigela and red buckeye. A nice group of vines, such as, honeysuckle, 
morning glory, trumpet creeper, scarlet runner bean are on the menu. Perennials 
they'll dig...bee balm, cannas, cardinal flower,coneflower, columbine (my State 
Flower), coral bells, four o'clocks, foxglove, agastache,lupine, penstemon and 
the yucca. They will be your new best friends if you supply the annuals of 
fuchsia, impatiens, petunias, salvias and shrimp plant.</p> 
<p>Attracting hummingbirds to your garden can make for a very pleasant summer, 
share their story, relationships, and flight plans with your friends and 
family. What a great opportunity to educated and enjoy the rewards. Remember, 
we all share this big blue marble with some amazing flowers... and the animals 
who love them !!! Get more information atwww.hummingbirds.net or with my 
friends at the Colorado State University atwww.ext.coloradostate.edu  fact 
sheet #5.504.</p>

<h2>Blooming Plants...</h2>  Blooming plants...when you think about them, we 
normally visualize a nice yellow mum in a hat basket with a cheerful bow and a 
card that says a sentiment appropriate for the occasion. Sweet, but lacks 
pizzazz. There are now a huge variety of &quot;bloomers&quot; that can really 
make that gift have a &quot;wow&quot; impact. Traditional flower arrangements, 
are an excellent gift, we ALL feel the positive impacted of flowers, the sense 
of happiness, how they make us smile and just feel better about everything. The 
warm fuzzy that someone was or is thinking about us, wishing us well or we are 
in their thoughts and have their support at a difficult time in our lives. Fun 
blooming plants will give the same reaction and promote having flowers and 
plants around as a way of life.<br>
<br>
 Bloomers have an exciting life of 
their own, longevity, every imaginable color, sizes and textures, easy care, 
fragrances and some can even be planted outside after enjoying their company 
inside in the home. There are traditional bloomers like poinsettias, mums, 
shamrocks, azaleas and Easter lilies. A perfect gift...given for the specific 
holidays. What I'm going to tell you about is other plants that are fun to 
present to your host, friends or family anytime for any reason, or no reason at 
all, except to say, &quot;I saw this and thought you'd enjoy it !&quot; What a 
nice thing for someone to do, I know it would make me feel special. So, here 
are a few plant to have fun with.<br>
<br>
 The garden centers and florists 
will be able to steer you towards some more interesting choices. Hydrangeas... 
their huge heads blue, purples, whites and pinks. They love the H2O, so keep'em 
moist. Kalanchoes with their bright colors of reds, oranges, yellows and pinks. 
Cyclamens sporting upright spiral flowers of purples, reds, white and 
bi-colors. They come in standard and mini types. Don't forget the African 
Violet with it's dainty, but long lived durability. This group is wonderful, 
some work horses of the blooming plant family. <br>
 My next group is a little 
more out of the box. Orchids are amazing with their tropical look and easier to 
grow than you think. Other tropical's, like hibiscus, fuchsias, anthriums on a 
lava rock, jasmines with their amazing fragrance will be a hit. During certain 
times of the year, you'll find bougainvilleas and mandevillias available as 
bloomers. If you're in a tropical climate, they then can be planted outside. 
Think about a nice big red, pink or purple geranium, a low cost alternative, 
that will last all summer. Have that professional florist wrap it up nice...the 
recipient will enjoy it in a sunny window and after fear of last frost...on the 
deck or patio !!! Most garden centers have perennials potted up in fun 
containers, ready to slap a bow on them, blooms of columbine, pansies, primrose 
with the leafiness of ornamental kale to round it out. These can be enjoyed on 
a patio now and then replanted in your flower gardens and enjoyed year after 
year...what a nice memory and value. <br>
 Almost any plant can be given as a 
great gift, from patio pots filled with annual flowers to hanging baskets of 
petunias, lobelia and potato vines. Imagine a beautiful lilac shrub, foil 
wrapped with a periwinkle bow with planting instructions to plant, in honor of 
a friends pet that has passed.... what a nice tribute.<br>
 In the future, when 
you are thinking about what to arrive with, at any function...have some fun 
with it, ask your favorite florist what they have or can get for you, give it 
some thought and make them wonder...this is cool, where the heck did they find 
this ???!!! <strong><br>
