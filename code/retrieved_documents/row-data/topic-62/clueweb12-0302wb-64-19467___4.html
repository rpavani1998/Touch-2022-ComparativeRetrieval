<h1>Basic Guide to Indoor Container Gardening</h1> <br>
<br>

<p>A real estate salesman will tell you that in buying and selling property 
&quot;location, location, location&quot;&#157; is everything. The same thing is 
true for indoor container gardening. Your success or failure will depend 
entirely on how well your containers are built, where they are placed, and how 
much light they receive -- especially if you plan to attempt herbs or 
vegetables. (Remember, the deeper rooted the vegetable the deeper pot it will 
need. If you're unsure, ask at your local nursery.) Of course the good thing is 
that because you are gardening in containers, you can move them. Be prepared 
for that if things start wilting.<br>
<br>
 Although your indoor garden plants 
may require more of you in terms of planning and care, the reward of welcoming 
living plants into your home will far outweigh the challenges. A special word 
of caution, however. Many plants are toxic to household pets, cats in 
particular. If you have animals, you may want to place your containers in an 
area where the pets are not allowed or plan to carefully select only those 
plants that will not harm your furry friends.<br>
<br>
<b>Selecting the Right 
Containers</b><br>
<br>
 We're all comfortable with the concept of having a 
fern in the house, the stray begonia, or maybe a cactus in the window sill. 
Ditch that idea if you really want to have an indoor garden.&#157; Start 
thinking in terms of attractive containers (remember, they're going to be part 
of your home) that are large enough (15 to 120 quarts) to play host to a 
community of complimentary plants. By selecting the right plants, you can even 
achieve natural pest control. Some plants have chemicals in their leaves or 
roots, which drive bugs away. For instance, planting basil near fennel will 
keep hover flies off the fennel. (Like the caution about your pets, this kind 
of planned planting requires careful research. Again, make a friend at your 
local plant nursery.)<br>
<br>
 You can use just about anything that will hold 
soil and provide adequate drainage as a container. (Drain holes should be about 
1/2 inch across and don't forget to line the pot with a thin mesh at the bottom 
to prevent soil loss through the holes. Also, plan to set the pots up on 
something like bricks or decorative stands to further enhance drainage.) If 
necessary, you can always put holes in the bottom of whatever you've selected 
yourself. If you pick something like an interesting old washtub that will rust, 
get something of the approximate size and shape to serve as a liner and limit 
or eliminate the container's contact with moisture. Some other things to 
remember:<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Containers with narrow openings limit what you can plant.</li> <br>

<li>Plastic pots deteriorate when exposed to sunlight.</li> <br>

<li>Wooden containers that are not lined rot. (Redwood and cedar do better 
than other woods.)</li> <br>

<li>Terracotta pots dray out rapidly, so the plants require watering more 
often.</li> <br>

<li>In hot climates, pick light-colored pots to decrease the absorption of 
heat.</li> <br>

<li>Glazed ceramic pots work well from a watering standpoint and are 
attractive.</li> <br>
<br>
<b>Selecting Your Soil</b> <br>
<br>
 You want a 
planting medium that holds enough moisture to keep the roots of your plants 
from drying out, but one that also drains fairly rapidly. (Standing water in a 
container makes the plants themselves rot.) Every plant has individual soil 
requirements, although most will do well in a high-grade potting mixture. (Just 
as a word of caution, most commercial mixes run a little on the acidic side and 
may require the addition of lime.) Most container gardeners choose a 
lightweight, 'soil-less'&#157; potting mixture to lessen the chances of plant 
disease and to discourage weed growth. When you fill the pots, you'll want to 
leave about two inches at the top so you'll have room to add mulch or something 
like sphagnum moss later on that assists with water retention.<br>
<br>
<b>
Location, Location, Location</b> <br>
<br>
 As a general rule, your plants will 
need a minimum of five hours of direct sun daily. If you're going to be 
planting something like tomatoes, you'll need more; cabbage or lettuce can do 
with less. You'll want to check the individual requirements for flowers as they 
vary widely. Do not put plants with widely divergent light requirements in the 
same pot. It's a recipe for disaster! Ditto with watering requirements. 
Container gardening is very much the science of pairing like plants with like 
plants to get the best results.<br>
<br>
 When you work out the variables of 
container, potting soil, light, and moisture, you are well on the road to 
establishing a workable container garden. Start simple and work up toward more 
complex combinations. In the beginning you may find that some of the following 
annuals are your best choices: alyssum, begonia, coleus, geranium, impatiens, 
marigolds, periwinkle, nasturtiums, pansies, salvia, snapdragons, and zinnias. 
Over time, as you become more experienced with your containers, you can branch 
out and successfully grow an even wider variety of plants, adding natural life 
and color to your home environment.
