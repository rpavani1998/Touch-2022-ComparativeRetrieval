<h1>Buried Clay Pot Irrigation For The Garden {&amp; More}</h1> &nbsp; Print 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email <br>

<p>If you are looking for ways to reduce your garden&rsquo;s water usage this 
summer (and low maintenance watering), buried clay pot irrigation might just be 
the trick you&rsquo;re after. It&rsquo;s a new concept to me but this method 
has apparently been around for centuries yet still offers value to 
today&rsquo;s gardener. Here&rsquo;s a bunch of info to get you started and 
then I added several different DIY irrigation methods at the bottom (some 
simple and small enough for house plants while others are more suited for 
gardens and shrubbery). Enjoy!</p> 
<p>Use Pots That Are Unglazed For This Project</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the scoop: The idea is to bury clay pots (Ollas) in the ground 
making sure to keep the mouth level with (or just above) the soil surface and 
then fill them with water.</p> 
<p>As the soil dries, suction develops and the water slowly seeps out from 
inside the pot and into the soil around it (the suction force is created by 
soil moisture tension and/or plant roots themselves,source). This is a 
naturally automatic system, if it&rsquo;s been raining, the soil is wet so 
there is no moisture tension and the pots don&rsquo;t release any water. The 
soil gets just what it needs, right when it needs it with no gadgets or sensors 
required!</p> 
<p>Arrange the pots in clusters and plant your garden around them. How many do 
you need? Each pot will water the plants within its immediate area (responding 
to the soil moisture tension around it). The larger the pot you use, the larger 
the area it covers (and the less often you have to top it up with water).</p> 
<p>Since the pots are buried, water is delivered more efficiently at root 
level rather than above the soil surface (with water needing to travel a few 
inches down to reach the roots). To keep the system working optimally, add more 
water to the pots as needed and avoid letting them dry out completely. Dig the 
pots up at the end of the growing season to prevent breakage over cold winter 
months. This method can be used in container gardening as well, you&rsquo;ll 
just need to use smaller clay pots that will fit inside the containers or 
planter boxes leaving enough room for the plants to thrive.</p> 
<p><em>What kind of pots to use</em>: They need to be unglazed clay pots 
(otherwise the water will be sealed inside and won&rsquo;t seep out) and can 
have a wide or narrow mouth. Select pots that don&rsquo;t have a long or 
fragile neck so they&rsquo;ll withstand being buried without breaking. You can 
use regular flower pots but make sure to seal closed the drainage hole. Keep 
the mouth of the jar covered to prevent insects and debris from getting inside 
and to help reduce water loss through evaporation. If there are no fitted lids 
for the jars, you can use flat rocks, shells or ceramic tiles depending on the 
size of the hole.</p>

with water. Source: upetd.up.ac.za (pdf download)</p> 
<p><em>Tip</em>: To test whether a pot will work or not, fill it with water 
and watch if the surface becomes damp. If it does, it&rsquo;s porous enough.</p>
<p><em>Bonus</em>: Because the soil is kept moist inches below the soil 
surface, this helps reduce the growth of weeds (also means less water 
consumption and less maintenance).</p> 
<h2>Resources</h2> 
<p>Buried Pot Surrounded By Plants From ecocomposite.org</p> 
<p>Here are some reference pages with more details (also make sure to grab the 
25 page pdf linked to in the diagram image above)&hellip;</p> 
<p>ecocomposite.org: Provides a bit of history to this technique and traces it 
back to over 2,000 years ago (from China). Also gives brief details of how it 
works and compares its results to other irrigation systems.</p> 
<p>Olla Irrigation: (Clay Pot System) Lots of information on this page 
including a tip to add liquid fertilizer to the water (you&rsquo;ll need just a 
quarter to half the amount you would normally use). They also show a DIY using 
regular clay flowerpots attached to each other using waterproof Gorilla Glue 
and silicon caulking. They advise painting the top of the Olla with white paint 
to reduce evaporation (top part of the jar will be exposed to the sun).</p> 
<h2>More Ideas</h2> 
<p>Is this clay pot method too much for what you need? Check out these 
ideas&hellip;</p> 
<p>lifehacker.com</p> Automated Drip System: You don&rsquo;t need to know much 
about hardware or plumbing, nor do you have to dig any trenches.
<p></p>
<p>After setting up the head, you simply lay 1/2 tubing down and stake it 
where you&rsquo;ll want to irrigate. Any place where you&rsquo;d like to add 
some water output, you simply puncture the tubing with a specially designed 
tool, leaving a clean hole.</p>
<p>System is flexible, pretty much leak-proof, and go together like a box of 
legos.</p> <br>

<p>radmegan.blogspot.com</p> Coke Bottle Watering Globes: The idea is to fill 
glass bottles with water and stick them neck down into moist soil. The soil 
seals around the bottle opening and water releases only as the soil dries. You 
can use larger bottles (for example wine bottles) if you need more time between 
refilling.
<p></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a similar idea using 2 liter plastic soda bottles from 
yougrowgirl.com. This places the bottle neck down as well but has the bottom 
cut off so you have a large funnel to work with (and collects the rain water 
too).</p> <br>

<p>shelterrific.com</p> Iowa Watering Hole Trick: Keep trees and shrubs 
watered by drilling a hole in the bottom of a 5 gallon bucket, place it near 
the trunk and fill with water. This will slowly release the water into the 
soil, reducing the need for soaker hoses.
<p></p>
<p>Supplies needed: A drill with 1/4&Prime; bit, 5-gallon plastic bucket and a 
hose to fill pail with water.</p>
<p>To keep debris out (and potentially clogging the hole), cover with a piece 
of board.</p> <br>

<p>csupomona.edu</p> DIY Bucket Drip: This is a gravity system to feed your 
drip irrigation system. A heavy pail and a few parts are required, but 
it&rsquo;s fairly simple to setup.
<p></p>
<p>Advises that if your bucket is too transparent, the light will encourage 
the growth of algae so choose a pail that&rsquo;s dark and won&rsquo;t let much 
light in.</p>
<p>Also gives the tip to choose a sturdy object to elevate the bucket since 
once filled, it&rsquo;s darn heavy (5 gallons is about 33 lbs.).</p> <br>

<p>craftzine.com</p> Houseplant Wicking System: The idea is simple yet 
brilliant: feed water from a bowl underneath (or beside) the plant into your 
plant&rsquo;s soil using strips of cotton fabric.
<p></p>
<p>There are two different arrangement examples provided. Very simple way to 
keep your plants happy and avoid drying out.</p>
<p>This project was previously featured on Tipnut and moved here for better 
organization.</p> <br>

<p>lettuceshare.com</p> Wine Bottle Waterer: A simple setup using a wine 
bottle, wire from a hanging candle holder (or other hanger) and glass 
flat-backed marbles (to help get the drip right). <br>

<p>howstuffworks.com</p> Plastic Milk Jug Ollas: Instead of using clay jugs, 
try this cheap version using plastic jugs instead. Several holes are drilled 
into the plastic (advises filling containers with water, freezing and then 
drilling) then the jugs are buried into the soil (same idea as discussed in the 
article above). Fill with water, twist on the cap and then refill as needed. 
<br> 
<p>veggiegardener.com</p> Simple Watering Wells: These are made by recycling 
plastic plant pots (one gallon or half-gallon sizes), bury them in the ground 
(keeping the rim just above ground level) and then filling with rocks. The 
water will slowly drip out through the holes at the bottom. Neat idea 
that&rsquo;s a lot less expensive to put together than the clay pot method 
mentioned at top. <br>

<p>suburbanfarmonline.com</p> Make Your Own Ollas: Here&rsquo;s another clever 
&amp; cheap DIY, two terra cotta pots are attached to each other with Gorilla 
Glue then sealed on one end. Bury in the ground, leaving a couple inches above 
ground. Water is poured into the top hole (that wasn&rsquo;t plugged). <br>

<p>This looks like a good solution to the hot, dry spells but, I&rsquo;m 
wondering about mosquitoes breeding on the water if it doesn&rsquo;t go down 
fast enough.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Sharon, that&rsquo;s a valid concern but it&rsquo;s prevented by keeping 
the mouth of the pot covered.</p> Reply <br>

<p>What a brilliant idea! A bit of cheesecloth and then a rock on the opening 
would really keep junk and bugs out.</p> 
<p>I have some broken clay pots that will fill the holes in the 
&ldquo;regular&rdquo; flower pots nicely.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I live in the northeast and would love to use this method. If I were to use 
this method, I&rsquo;d use a fairly large pot, but don&rsquo;t want random 
holes in the yard during the winter, can the pots stay buried year round?<br>

<p>Hi PH, I wouldn&rsquo;t but then my winters are freezing cold here and the 
pots would crack for sure. You could refill the holes with dirt as you take 
them out. It takes just one crack in the pot for this to no longer work, water 
would seep out steadily. If you think your winters might be warm enough, try 
leaving one pot in the ground over the winter and see what happens.</p> Reply

<p>The link to the 25 page pdf did not work for me.<br>
 Otherwise, this looks 
like a good idea! My soil is quite sandy and watering and irrigation never 
seemed to help. I would combine underground watering with composting on top. I 
think I will implement this come spring!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I did this method last year but will definitely change to the milk jug WITH 
COVER idea. Last year a mouse fell into my clay pot, couldn&rsquo;t apparently 
get out, drowned and began rotting in my pot. =/ Since the pot was a narrow top 
opening I didn&rsquo;t see it and when I did see something there I thought it 
was a leaf and didn&rsquo;t investigate. It was reallllllllly nasty! So I 
totally suggest some sort of lid. It did a nice job of keeping my tomato plants 
moist but not soaked or bone dry which was awesome.</p> Reply <br>
