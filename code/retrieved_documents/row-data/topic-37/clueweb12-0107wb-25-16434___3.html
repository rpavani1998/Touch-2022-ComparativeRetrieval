<p>Small Updates [Saturday 24 July 1999 - 14:48 CET - cosmo] <br>
 I have 
tweaked all the pages with better font sizes, updated links and text - so 
everything should be a bit better now. Also take a look at theQuake2 
Screenshots page, with 6 screenshots taken with a ATI Rage Fury 128 in 1024x768 
by Jarle Kaste. When my TNT2 Ultra arrives in a week or so, I will update the 
screenshots section with more shots from various 3D Games. I'm going to a 
birthday party this eve, so there will not be any updates tonight. Thedrivers 
section is also updated with the latest driver database from DriverZone.</p> 
<p>UT Level of The Week [Saturday 24 July 1999 - 13:05 CET - cosmo] <br>
 
Peter told me that GT Interactive has updated theirUnreal Tournament level of 
the week page. The current chief is entitled DM-Tempest. Check it out for more 
information and screenshots.</p> 
<p>Tim Sweeney on Platforms [Saturday 24 July 1999 - 13:05 CET - cosmo] <br>
 
My buddy Martin onUnreal Nation fired off a mail to Tim Sweeney wondering what 
platforms Epics next project would support, both when it comes to graphical 
API's and OS's. Here's what Tim had to say:</p> 
<p>Our next engine will support standard, multi-hardware API's only, no 
proprietary API's. Most likely, we will support both Direct3D and OpenGL. D3D 
clearly has better quality drivers on the PC, and OpenGL is the API of choice 
for portability to non-PC platforms. So the only bold statement I'll make is 
that we won't be supporting Glide and other proprietary API's in the long-term 
future.</p> 
<p>We will develop the next engine on at least two platforms simultaneously. 
At least PC and Playstation2 (pending arrival of a development system). I can't 
promise Linux, but it would be pretty easy I think. The big complication we've 
faced porting Unreal Tournament is that our C++ code needed lots of 
modifications for Gnu C++, but since that's the Playstation's compiler too, our 
code should be Linux-friendly all along.</p> 
<p>European AvP 1.1 Patch [Saturday 24 July 1999 - 13:05 CET - cosmo] <br>
 
Yesterday,AVault posted the European version of the Aliens vs. Predator version 
1.1 patch, that, along with other tweaks and improvements, adds the long 
awaited in-game save function.</p> 
<p>New GL Ports [Saturday 24 July 1999 - 13:05 CET - cosmo] <br>
 Saw on Blue's
 that there's a new version ofGLHexen, Kodak's OpenGL-powered version of Hexen, 
as well as a new version of hisDoomGL port of the Doom source code.</p> 
<p>New Voodoo3 Drivers for NT [Saturday 24 July 1999 - 13:05 CET - cosmo] <br>

Blue mentions that 3dfx has the Windows NT version of the recently released new 
Win9x drivers for the Voodoo3.</p> 
<p>TRIBES 1.6 3dfx Bug [Friday 23 July 1999 - 23:44 CET - cosmo] <br>
 I don't 
know if NoName mentioned the release of the TRIBES 1.6 Patch last week - anyway 
- here's a link toThe Downloads Page on Tribesplayers.com. Nels Bruckner, the 
TRIBES Project Manager, sent in this explanation of a bug discovered in the 
latest release - which swoops on cards based on a chip powered by 3dfx toBlue:
</p> 
<p>Arg! We let an obvious one slip through in the 1.6 patch of Tribes. The 
specific problem is with user created art (reticles, skins, etc.) and Voodoo 
configurations with more than one TMU. User created art will show up as either 
all black or black and white or as other funky looking combos... basically 
totally wrong. We have the problem fixed, we will get the patch up ASAP. My 
apologies for this obvious error.<br>
<br>
 People seem to be liking the OpenGL 
support though! :)</p> 
<p>Quake3 Test 1.07 Released [Thursday 22 July 1999 - 21:54 CET - cosmo] <br>
 
Yet another update to the Quake3Arena Test is up on the net. The test version 
of this multiplayer-only game is available as an update to the 1.06 version 
NoName mentionedlast week, or as a full 30MB installer from scratch. The new 
version fixes some cheating bugs, hopefully fixes some server problems, and 
should generally play much better than the previous releases. Note that this 
version is available as a Win32 client and server, in addition to a Linux 
client. Check the news archive and Quake3 Test Section onBlue's News if you 
want more tips and tweaks for improving your performance, and grab the files 
fromThe Official Q3Test Site.</p> 
<p>When on the subject, I can tell you that id Software's Graeme 
&quot;Zaphod&quot; Devine has made a.plan update:</p> 
<p>1.07 is out there. Please try and find cheat exploits and report them to us!
</p> 
<p>Also, keep in mind that this is a test, and not the final product. There's 
a lot in the test which is very temporary, so while we've taken great pride in 
putting out very solid test releases, we're still working hard on the final 
product and very much appreciate your feedback (q3feedback@idsoftware.com) in 
getting this product right for you - the players -</p> 
<p>I get a bunch of feedback from people wanting this product to be more like 
Quake 1 or Quake 2, while others look for us to innovate and make something 
brand new. Quake 3 is arcade deathmatch, nothing more and nothing less. It's 
not Quake 1 nor Quake 2, but does nod it's head in the direction of the online 
DM version of both those products (and apparently pissing off both parties at 
the same time).</p> 
<p>Look to the next id product to give you the &quot;brand new&quot; gameplay 
and world. Quake 3 Arena will keep basically with what you've seen and read 
about up until now and it's now time to put this one to bed.</p> 
<p>Misc Sputter [Thursday 22 July 1999 - 21:36 CET - cosmo] <br>
 Much of my 
mail just went to nowhere the last weeks due the server problems, but here's a 
short round up of the most important things I _got_ mail about. NoName may have 
mentioned some of the items before, but this is a nice abridge of news anyway:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Update: </b>Anyway, I'll not accomplish this post today, simply because 
I do not have the time, and most of the news are outdated anyway...</li> 
<li>AGN has posted a review of Trophy Bass 3D. They are also giving away the 
new version of the Intensor chair, details ontheir contests page. If you have 
any contests you would like us to list, pleasee-mail Joshua the contest details.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Back from the ehh... past [Thursday 22 July 1999 - 20:43 CET - cosmo] <br>
 
The king is back! I have had two wonderful weeks in France and a bunch of other 
cool countries in Europe. I will upload some pictures when I get the time, 
promise ;) Well, I have one person to thank spesifically: NoName. He kept the 
site alive while I was away, although he messed up the news-archiveing stuff 
and was on a little vacation himself. I guess you used tons of time (even if it 
went wrong) with the news-archiveing - but I'm only using a few minutes, you 
little Untitled guy. Routine, my friend, routine... Anyway, I will send you 
some stuff (software, maby hardware) for the work, and I hope you will continue 
to help me out with the news! And just kick my balls for the archiveing-thing, 
it is I that should make a news-updating script soon. It will come. And a 
faster server too (a new server is here, but not set up first). News archive 
fixed.</p> 
<p>I had a IBM Thinkpad with a 9600 Modem, but being on the net with a 
cellular phone, calling from France to Norway - is _very_ expensive. It was in 
my mind to write the stuff offline and then uploading it, but there wasn't any 
very important news - and the weather was fine. So I just downloaded Winamp and 
played some music... When I was going to update some days later, the Thinkpad 
went boom-bang for the first time since April - I think it is some RAM-related 
problems. My sweet Compaq PalmTop didn't want to surf at all, I will try to fix 
it in the next days. Also note that I will be on a small vacation five-seven 
days the next week on my cabin - but summer is summer, ya know...</p> 
<p>Also note that my mailserver was down from Monday to yesterday. Important 
mails should be resent. I will not bother you with very outdated news - only 
the fresh new stuff - plus the noteworthly things NoName didn't broadcast. Bye 
for now - it's time for washing clothes (my mom, not me, you stoopid), looking 
at my new DVD's on my little cinema, testing my new parfume-set, mowing the 
grass, and - you know.</p> 
<p>For those who feel like taking a part in my life, almost like The Truman 
Show (ehh), read the story below (I know it becaume awfully big - but that's 
life):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to myself of course, my nearest family (my 
dad, mom and little brother), and some close frieds (Ragnar B&oslash; - the
Mandatum chief monkey, his wife and two daughters) fired up our Audis and took 
the ferry from Oslo to Kiel. The sister boat - that travelled from Kiel to Oslo 
the same time - had a dramatic fire and all the passengers was evacuated, and 
the ferry we travelled by grounded two days after our trip.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But mr. Lucky and his crew did (almost) just fine and was in 
Hamburg after a short hour on die Deutsche Autobahn. And now, here's the 
&quot;almost&quot;: A big Semitrailer did a rather Spanish turn and sqashed our 
backlight... There was a bit trouble with some insurance-stuff, but the light 
was fine after &frac12;-hour with a funny cheap price. Oh. Germany... We did a 
little shopping and went to the zoo before we (and the cars) took the 
night-train to Basel, and drove stright through Switzerland.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent the night in a nice hotel in a weird town with very 
simular houses. That wasn't that weird anymore when we found out that the whole 
port was moved higher up in the mountains because the biggest, fake lake was 
made in the bottom! Funny, huh?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove, drove and 
drove - finally we reached our main goal: a nice (and expensive) villa outside 
Grimaud, which isn't far away from St. Tropez. The week was filled up with sun, 
sun and sun. And the pool was used diligently. We bathed, ate, watched some 
DVD's, went on bowling, mini-golf, a BIG theme park and tons of more. And the 
weather was constantly around 40&curren;C.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a 
wonderful week, we went into Italy, with some pretty impressive bridges and 
tunnels. But Norwegians still knows the art of tunnel and bridge-making! We 
spent the night in a _warm_ hotel in Lugano. Next to a big lake.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we drove to alsace, spending some nights at a 
really nice guy named Behrnard in a small town called Geubersville. His father 
and himself made wines (what else to do?), and of course we tasted and buyed 
the great-tasting wine (Henri Gross).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, we said 
goodbye to our dear friends and travelling-buddies, heading forward to 
L&uuml;hneburg in Germany. We spent the night on a old and cosy hotel, before 
we used the car some hours, arriving in a town near the port-town Hirtshals.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some abortive tries, we found a strange and big 
hotel. We spent the night there and was on the Color FESTIVAL ferry at 10 AM. 
We had a nice trip back to Oslo.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here I am.</p>
