<h3>Clutter's opt gets asynchronous</h3> 
<p>I'm trying to get asynchronous slide loading in opt to don't waste so much 
memory while loading pdf presentations. (Seeo-hand's #410 to get the latest 
patch).</p> 
<p>This is the first time that I do any kind of computer animation, and given 
the fact that my C skills are not any extraordinary, and that I did this hack 
in 1 hour (most of the time looking at others .h and .c to get used to the 
api). I think that we can say, from a empirical and scientific point of view 
that theClutter API is extremely easy to use, in a nutshell, it rocks! (It also 
means, that our friends from openedhand rocks too).</p> 
<p>The result is not any impressive, but I'm proud of it despite that, and 
that's what matters the most:</p> <br>
<br>

<p><em>YouTube / OGG</em></p> 
<p> So far, what the patch does is create one slide per pdf page on the 
document and animate each actor on the slide. Next step is disallow the slide 
change until the pdf page is loaded.</p>

<h3>No words</h3> 
<p>I have no words on what's happening at home. A forest guard set up the Gran 
Canaria south western forest on fire to protest against his job situation, 
smart move huh?. One of the most beautiful landscapes of my Island, lost. There 
is also another forest fire on Tenerife, the authorities suspect that it's also 
intentional. This is the scary landscape:</p> 
<p><em>Sadly, those are not clouds.</em></p>  I cannot describe what I feel. 
Being away from home is making it even more strange. The saddest thing is that 
it was intentional, someone did it, someone wanted this to happen. Most times 
I'm faithful about the human kind, today is not one of those days.

<h3>Jilorio: Gnome backgrounds and themes two-dot-zero</h3> 
<p>One of the first things that I missed when I realized that my laptop was 
lost was (beside tons of photos and college documentation) a couple of old 
hacks, most of them on pygtk, more than a year ago I started lurking on the 
#art-gnome channel trying to add atom feeds toart.gnome.org, benzea did a great 
job adding support to art.gnome.org back then. Once the support was added, I 
hacked a small pygtk app to use the feed to select backgrounds from the site 
and apply them without browser interaction.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, there was a copy of the hack on my gmail history, and Jilorio 
backgrounds has come alive again. Check out thegit repository or the 0.1 tarball
.<br>
</p> 
<p><em>YouTube / OGG<br>
</em></p> 
<p>If you are looking for an easy hack, metacity and gtk themes variants of 
the app would be really cool. Any patch or comments are welcome.</p>

<h3>Post Guadec post</h3> 
<h2>Guadec</h2> 
<p>At last, my post Guadec post. What a crazy week, the first day I lose my 
backpack with my laptop and my home's keys, so it wasn't a good start. However, 
I had a great fun, and it was great to stay there again.</p> 
<p>I would like to congratulate Paul and Thomas and the rest of the 
organization for such a great job, and I'm looking forward to go to Istambul 
next year.</p> 
<h2>Clutter rock my ass</h2> 
<p>One of the things that I most enjoyed was the clutter+opt+poppler+gtollina 
mushup that fer and me hacked at Guadec. I decided to go a step further and I 
have hacked a formal patch to add pdf support for clutter's opt. Check it out 
at openedhand'sbugzilla.</p> 
<p>I would like to add PDF transition support and maybe slide caching at some 
point. By the way, the Clutter api is just beautiful, kudos to the o-hand 
hackers.</p>

<h3>Indiana logo, second try</h3> 
<p>Due to the lack of success of the Transformer's version of my first Indiana 
logo proposal. I've came up with a another idea for it:</p> 
<p><em>This one looks like a husky for sure (is a vectorized photo of a husky 
actually), brought to you byInkscape.</em></p> <br>

<h3>Thoughts on the Virtualization area.</h3> 
<p>Yesterday a coworker passed me a link about an OpenGL virtualization 
project fromGSoC '06, VMGL. Basically it allows you to show OpenGL accelerated 
graphics of applications running in a virtualized guest OS like Linux.</p> 
<p>The results of the benchmarks are just impressive. Almost native 
performance and concurrent execution of various games like Quake3 or Unreal. 
It's been tested with Xen and VMware as far as I have read. Further work to 
achieve the same features with Direct3D is planned. Meanwhile, guys on VMWare, 
are making amazing things likethis.</p> 
<p>I'm starting to seriously believe that this kind of progress on the 
virtualization space is going to change we think about applications, operating 
systems and even debugging. The boundaries of the platform where you run your 
applications are just going to be blurred, and users, developers and customers, 
are going to be able to have real choice.</p>

<h3>Spec Files Extras Developer.</h3> 
<p>Spec Files Extras, is a project maintained by some guys at Sun to provide 
an easy way to create Solaris/OpenSolaris packages from rpm-like spec files. 
You can check the software available on the repositoryhere.</p> 
<p>Laszlo Peters (laca), from the JDS Common Build Environment fame, has 
granted me today commit access to the SFE repository:</p> 
<blockquote>

<p>Thanks laca!</p> 
<p><strong>PS</strong>: Wondering why am I fixing the git package? I cannot 
tell you yet ;-)</p>

<h3>Developing GNOME is going to rock even more very soon!</h3> 
<p>When I started to getting involved with GNOME, I missed some features and 
got frustrated on how many details I needed to know to solve simple problems. 
However, the magic of opensource makes every problem a matter of time.</p> 
<p>It seems that Gtk 2.12 is going to include the GtkBuilder API that Johan 
has been developing for a while, this is going to allow to abtract a lot of 
details, it not only replace libglade and UIManager, but also, it will be 
possible to define treeview columns and even populate data on it from a ui 
designer, such designer doesn't exist yet, this ui is yet to be created, but 
again, time will fix this.</p> 
<p>Alexander Larsson is working on GVFS, a new API for accessing files and 
perform IO operations, that whips gnome-vfs' ass in terms of simplicity and 
portability. Kudos to Alex for this work.</p> 
<p>On the other hand I realized today via FootNotes, that Anjuta 2.2, the 
first stable release of the 2.x series has been released, congratulations to 
the developers. I hope they can include it for the development suite for 2.22, 
this is a must have.</p> 
<p>We have the wider and best maintained set of bindings for a graphical 
toolkit, just take a look at the development activity inPyGTK, ruby-gnome, 
java-gnome, gtkmm.. (the list goes on). This is a core asset of the GNOME 
platform since it encourage our so beloved freedom of choice. C haters, you 
have no excuse to become a GNOME developer :-)</p> 
<p>GNOME is getting simpler, easier to develop and more usable every day, and 
we are not even braking backwards compatibility! Kudos to all the GNOME 
community.</p> 
<h2>The personal side</h2> 
<p>Work keeps me busy enough to being unable to accomplish the promise I made 
myself to release a Gtk+ msi installer before GUADEC. Hope is not lost yet, but 
I still need to focus on other things yet.</p> 
<p>Working on Sun is being great so far, at last I have the opportunity to 
learnsome things that I've been delaying for too long. Some of them funny, 
others&nbsp; just mandatory, but I'm enjoying my time here as I've never did in 
the past, I couldn't have thought in any better first full-time job in my life.

<h3>OpenSolaris and Linux, closer?</h3> 
<p>As I said on my previous post, I would like to see the lines that divides 
OpenSolaris and Linux, as blurred as possible (or deleted). Latest commentsfrom 
Linus about the GPLv3 sounds promising, but even more promising is the response 
fromJonathan. So here we are, I now can see the day where Linux and Solaris can 
reach a common point.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, it seems that we can do better with our patch policy. Darren has 
alreadyanswered to the avahi issue, sometimes, is not as easy as Sun does not 
get it, but, some projects just don't get it that API stability decisions does 
matters to avoid crappiness, bugginess and bronkeness in the long term.</p> 
<p>I would also like to point out that, Inidiana is a binary distribution 
project inside the OpenSolaris.org community, and right now is anything but a 
discussion mailing list and a bunch of good ideas and intentions, so nothing to 
do with Gnome patches for Solaris and Solaris Express.</p> 
<p>I'm leaving now to attend the monthly Irish Python User Group meeting.<br>

<h3>Indiana thoughts and ideas</h3> 
<p>I do think that Indiana is a good idea. The reason because I think this is 
because I'm a strongly community guy, and I do think that a good healthy and 
friendly community is the most important assent to any free software project. 
And I do think that Indiana is probably the best effort to achieve that inside 
the OpenSolaris community. It tries to adress some issues and it has a name, an 
identity and a direction.</p> 
<p>This excites me because I would like to see the days when hostility between 
OpenSolaris and the Linux community is over (at the same time I also think that 
the GPLv3 would be a huge step), but at the same time, making people from the 
most adopted UNIX-like operating system out there comfortable on OpenSolaris 
would be a huge step (for both projects and the whole free software community). 
Lots of old-school Solaris users are afraid of a GNU/OpenSolaris thing, and 
neither Indiana is a GNU/OpenSolaris effort nor all GNU tools are bad as evil. 
But a nice text help when you use &quot;top&quot; trying to help users to 
gather the same information they expect (something like what Ubuntu does now 
when you type a missing command) would help a lot of people.</p> 
<p>And the same time, it tries to let others people to make their own flavors 
of OpenSolaris with a low entry barrier. This is another huge point in my 
opinion. The easier people is able to adapt OpenSolaris for their needs, the 
most problems it solves, and the most adoption it gets. There are also people 
complaining about having too many distributions would be harmful for 
OpenSolaris because people wouldn't know which one to choose.</p> 
<p>OpenSource is all about free of choice. And sure, choice have a pay, but 
from the mid 90's we all know what the lack of choice have done to this 
industry. Poeple out there have really different ways of thinking, and really 
different problems, let them choose. And the most important thing, make easy fo 
r them to work on building their own tools from yours one.</p> 
<p>All this thing of a more affordable OpenSolaris excites me, and what do I 
do when I excited about something? I just draw about it. Since this is a 
community effort, I won't wait to anyone in Sun marketing to make a logo (sorry 
guys :P), so I've done my own:</p> 
<p>Indiana was the name's of Indiana Jones' dog, and if I remember correctly, 
it was a Husky. The stripes is about american indian make up stripes. And the 
green letters, are a quite obvious easter egg. I think it needs more work, but 
depending on the feedback and the acceptance, I would work more on it and I 
will propose it as an official logo. By the way, Inkscape Powered!</p> 
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Ian, you should be proud, this is the second official 
project with your name in it, let's hope this one is at least as successful as 
the first one ;)</p>
