<p><strong>B2 Gold, New Demo Soon, Shogo PR-Nine Days</strong>&nbsp; [5:02 PM 
EST]<strong><br>
</strong>Monolith CEO Jason Hall updated his .plan with the 
latest word from them, leading off with the news that Blood2 is officially gold 
(off to manufacture, and therefore, due in stores soon), and they plan on 
releasing a newer, better optimized Blood2 demo. There's also word on the Shogo 
Point Release (multiplayer patch), which he says will be released in nine days. 
Here's an excerpt from the lengthy post (the full post also discusses user 
Shogo art, and asks &quot;what in your opinion can Monolith do to help Shogo 
continue to sell well and gain more and more strong product interest that is 
capable of going well outside of the core-gaming market?&quot;):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Blood 2 is now much better optimized n' stuff and is now GOLD. GT has it 
and they are now &quot;doing what they do&quot; with it! Expect it in the 
stores very soon.</p> 
<p>Now that Blood 2 is gold, we are planning on re-releasing the more 
optimized demo. All that is really left for the new demo is for it to be tested 
(I'm installing it now - whoo hoo!). As soon as it passes all testing, we will 
make it available for the people who are interested! People who played the 
original Blood 2 demo and had speed/mouse/bug issues should be much happier 
with the new one.Once again, thank you all for your helpful input! This newer 
demo will also be a better gauge to determine how fast the final version of B2 
will run on your system!</p> 
<p>On to Shogo stuff: </p> 
<p>The Shogo Multiplayer Point Release (SMPR) is right on track for the Nov. 
15th deadline! It is looking fantastic and we are really excited about it. The 
final 1.1 patch will bring you some &quot;client-side-goodness&quot; for sure. 
Interestly enough, I've noticed a couple of things that are really cool with 
the upcoming patch...</p> 
<p>1.) There is current &quot;uncomfirmed and secret&quot; plan to release 
some awesome custom made deathmatch only levels with the patch! Kick Ass! I 
hope that those levels make it in!</p> 
<p>2.) There seems to have been quite a few options added to the ShogoServer 
stuff. One option in particular comes to mind... ramming damage ...No ROACHES 
in the HOUSE, for those that can't stand &quot;roaching&quot;...heh</p> 
<p>The shogo tools are being worked on / documented as we speak. We could just 
release them *as is* but we want to make them as useful as possible before we 
let them out. Yes, we are still going to give the world the game tools and 
source so not to worry. With the release of this stuff you are going to be able 
to MOD the hell out of Shogo. Also, GT has green lighted the release of Blood 
2's source and tools as well, so when both games have all their stuff out there 
you are seriously going to be in &quot;CONTENT CITY&quot;. It is hard for me to 
actually communicate how much MOD/TC power you are going to have in your hands. 
I can't wait to see what the community does with this stuff!</p> 
<p>Anyway, right after we release the SMPR, we will be finalizing the STSR 
(Shogo Tools and Source Release), and should be able to get it to you VERY SOON 
thereafter. And when Monolith says VERY SOON, it is a real VERY SOON! :)</p>

<p><strong>New Requiem Powers</strong>&nbsp; [5:02 PM EST]<strong><br>

</strong>Hell on Earth has posted some news on some new Angelic powers that are 
being added to Cyclone Studios' upcoming<em>Requiem: Avenging Angel</em>, 
including Apocalypse, and Exorcist (which from the sound of it, has nothing to 
do with Linda Blair/pea soup-type exorcisms at all).</p> 
<p><strong>Doom2 Tourney Results</strong>&nbsp; [5:02 PM EST]<strong><br>

<p><strong>Sin Load Times</strong>&nbsp; [2:57 PM EST]<strong><br>
</strong>
Ritual's Scott Alden updatedhis .plan with a tip that can help shorten those 
interminable map load times after the first time a map is loaded with a couple 
of console commands. It definitely made a big difference when I tried it, just 
don't let the lack of a status screen throw you off (for a second I thought my 
machine crashed). Here's the lowdown:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>***SIN LOADING TIMES*** </p> 
<p>If you want to increase your times for loading quick saves type these 
commands at the console before you start a game:</p> 
<p>developer 1<br>
 set flushmap 0 </p> 
<p>This speeds up &quot;quick&quot; loads i.e. when you already have the map 
loaded. Dying in the game isn't as painful now :-)</p> 
<p>By setting developer to 1, it will not draw the status bar, so you won't 
get to see in between level information. This will save you about 20 or so 
seconds of loading time on just about any map. You will probably also see some 
warnings printed out since developer provides verbose information about what's 
going on in the game.</p> 
<p>&quot;flushmap&quot; was used to explicitly free maps after they are 
already loaded for development purposes.</p> 
<p>These fixes will be incorporated into the first patch and these commands 
should help in the meantime. The status bar has been optimized as to not take 
up as much time, and flushmap will explicitly be set to 0.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There's also word in onethumb's .plan about a Sin tourney where the winner 
can walk away with $500.</p> 
<p><strong>Play KHG Maps in Unreal</strong>&nbsp; [1:18 PM EST]<strong><br>

</strong>A way to play maps from MicroProse's Unreal-engine Klingon honor Guard 
in Unreal with the KHG weapons comes in this tip sent along by moonglum:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I figured out a way to play Klingon Honor Guard maps in unreal, complete 
with Unreal blaster &amp; KHG weaponry/tiles... Here goes:<br>
 1. Copy the sfx 
files from KHG's sound folder to Unreal's.<br>
 2. Copy all the texture files 
from KHG's texture folder to Unreal's.<br>
 3. Copy the 4 files named Klingon.* 
from the system directory of KHG to Unreal's system folder.<br>
 4. Run the map.
<br> You may want to make backups of your Unreal texture files, as I believe 
some of them are overwritten. This is a nifty little trick, and actually goes 
to show how cool some of the future Unreal things will be. Perhaps someone 
could write a program where you wouldn't have to copy these file (i.e.: it 
would pull them from the correct folder when you run the map, sort of like a 
front end for the unreal engine...)</p> </blockquote>

same way on my system), I found I could get 1024X768 by picking the next 
highest setting, 1152x864.</p>

along the way:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>On a side note, this was our first chance to try out the Direct3D version 
of Half-Life, and we're happy to report that it looked almost identical to the 
OpenGL version. No wonder the game took so long to finish, the Direct3D port 
over is flawless, and fast as well. Half-Life will absolutely be the number one 
selling title this holiday season, I'd bet MY&#133;er&#133;.I mean SHARKY'S 
LIFE on it.</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>Heavy Gear II Demo Delayed Again</strong>&nbsp; [5:32 PM EST]
<strong><br>
</strong>The Heavy Gear II demo originally slated for release 
earlier in the week, and then rescheduled for today has been delayed again. 
Here's the announcement fromActivision's Heavy Gear II page:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The multiplayer bug that has been delaying release has been a pesky one, 
which has taken longer than expected to fix. The update from Production is that 
it has now been fixed, and our QA Department is currently performing a final 
compatibility sweep of the demo. Despite our best forecasts earlier in the 
week, the demo will not be out today. Whether release occurs tomorrow or later 
depends on what QA finds in its sweep. We are very close!</p> 
<p>We remain committed to bringing the demo out as soon as possible, but not 
before. As Dave Georgeson (Producer of HGII) has said, the production team is 
not willing to let any demo go out until the playability, connectability, and 
reliability of the game are solid enough that it's fun to play.</p> 
<p>Please bear with us a little longer. We are all VERY excited about this 
demo, and we sincerely believe the end result will be worth the wait!</p> 
<p>Sincerely, The Heavy Gear II Team </p> 
<p>P.S. The dates of the contest drawings (see link) will be moved according 
to the demo's actual release, so that the contest lasts a full week from the 
release. Please refer to the contest page for the final, updated dates once the 
demo is posted.</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>On Unreal Tournament</strong>&nbsp; [4:39 AM EST]<strong><br>

</strong>There's a statement up on PlanetUnreal from Epic's Mark Rein to try 
and shed some light, or actually cast some doubt, on the speculation about the 
nature of their upcoming project based on the title,<em>Unreal Tournament</em>, 
that slipped out in a recent GT Interactive Press Release:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Unfortunately I can't engage the gossip caused by the GT financial press 
release. They obviously made a big mistake in using the name of an unannounced 
product in their press release but I can't reverse that now.<br>
 When we're 
ready to announce what Unreal Tournament is then we'll announce it. That will 
probably be in 4-6 weeks. Until then I'm sure we'll have to endure a lot of 
inaccurate speculation as to what the product is based solely on what people 
think they can figure out from two simple words in a press release. Oh well, 
these things happen.</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>Sin SBLive! Fix</strong>&nbsp; [4:39 AM EST]<strong><br>
</strong>
TheRitual Entertainment page offers a solution for sound problems with 
Sin&nbsp;using a SoundBlaster Live!. Thanks Tripps. I had the SBLive! problem, 
and this fixed it for me. Here's the scoop:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>THIS JUST IN: </strong>Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live! Issues can 
be fixed with the following:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Download the new SBLive! drivers from Creative's Site. They are about 2 
weeks old. Make sure Environmental Sound is set to OFF in the Live! control 
panel. Turn the sound in Sin to Low Quality, Max Compatibility, and 3D Off.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>This is apparently the fix that Activision Customer Support is giving 
people who call in, so it should work great.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There is another fix on Voodoo Extreme from Billy who says the above fix 
doesn't work for him, but the one he posted (a bit of a kludge, unfortunately), 
does. Here goes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>On the Live you want to turn off Environmental Sound or turn the Direct 
Sound acceleration down -- to turn the acceleration down go to your multimedia 
properties, under playback - advanced properties, kick that acceleration mofo 
down one notch and try it, if it doesn't work, one more notch until you hit 
Basic. This probably isn't the fix that you're looking for, but it does work 
and at least lets you hear stuff (which is a huge plus after not having sound). 
Also turn off 3D sound in the Sin control panel.</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>Unreal Arena?</strong>&nbsp; [12:30 PM EST]<strong><br>
</strong>An 
announcement on Next-Generation Online offers details on Epic's upcoming 
project, a game called Unreal Tournament, which sounds like it's focused on 
multiplayer. Thanks loony. Here are the sketchy details from NGO:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In a statement regarding earnings GT revealed two choice news tidbits that 
had not yet been announced.</p> 
<p>The first, and certainly biggest, is Unreal Tournament, a title that, 
according to the release, is scheduled for an early 1999 release. While there 
were no details on this heretofore unannounced product, we're fairly certain 
from the name that it's going to be a multiplayer only title like Quake III.</p>
<p>Last week we reported that Epic would be making an announcement in 4-6 
weeks of a project it had been developing since Unreal's release in May. While 
it seems likely that this project is Unreal Tournament, Epic VP Mark Rein 
refused to comment for the story.</p> 
<p>According to GT, a release will come out shortly (within the next couple of 
weeks) for the project. A GT spokerperson told us that the title is in 
development at Epic and that &quot;people will be pretty excited about it.&quot;

<p><strong>Carmack at PGL</strong>&nbsp; [12:30 PM EST]<strong><br>
</strong>
John Carmack will be answering questions about Quake III Arena at the AMD PGL 
Championships in San Francisco on November 14 at 2:45 Pacific time. They are 
now accepting suggestions for questions to pose. Here's the lowdown from TEN's 
Garth Chouteau:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>John Carmack, co-founder, owner, and lead programmer of id Software, will 
appear in person on Nov. 14th, for the third and final day of the AMD PGL 
Championships being held at Club-i in San Francisco. He's not just there to 
witness the deciding matches in both the 1-on-1 (Quake II) and Teamplay (4-on-4 
Quake clans) categories featuring id games.</p> 
<p>From 2:45 to 3:30 (Pacific Time), he'll also be fielding questions and 
suggestions regarding the development of the much-anticipated Quake III Arena. 
*But here's the best part: you don't have to attend the PGL Season 3 
Championships to ask Carmack a question! Simply send your question(s) or 
suggestion(s) to : &quot;CarmackQA@pgl.net&quot; by Monday, Nov. 9th -- the 
best ones will be answered by JC at the PGL event. Since the event will be 
covered via live Webcast, you can see Carmack respond to your email even if 
you're sitting at your PC 3,000 miles away!</p> 
<p>Be sure the Subject of your email reads &quot;Carmack 
Question/Suggestion&quot; and include your full real name and preferred screen 
name, so we can credit you 'on the air' !</p> </blockquote>

<p><strong>John Carmack on Q3A Architecture</strong>&nbsp; [6:38 AM EST]
<strong><br>
</strong>John Carmack's .plan has an update on what he describes 
as the most significant portion of his talk at the FRAG2. The update is huge, 
here's an excerpt on how the issues he's discussing impact code portability and 
potential for cheating:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Related both issues is client side cheating. Certain cheats are easy to do 
if you can hack the code, so the server will need to verify which code the 
client is running. With multiple ported versions, it wouldn't be possible to do 
any binary verification.</p> 
<p>If we were willing to wed ourselves completely to the windows platform, we 
might have pushed ahead with some attempt at binary verification of dlls, but I 
ruled that option out. I want QuakeArena running on every platform that has 
hardware accelerated OpenGL and an internet connection.</p> 
<p>The only real solution to these problems is to use an interpreted language 
like Quake 1 did. I have reached the conclusion that the benefits of a standard 
language outweigh the benefits of a custom language for our purposes. I would 
not go back and extend QC, because tThat stretches the effort from simply 
system and interpreter design to include language design, and there is already 
plenty to do.</p> 
<p>I had been working under the assumption that Java was the right way to go, 
but recently I reached a better conclusion.</p> 
<p>The programming language for QuakeArena mods is interpreted ANSI C. (well, 
I am dropping the double data type, but otherwise it should be pretty 
conformant)</p> 
<p>...</p> 
<p>The tools necessary for building mods will all be freely available: a 
modified version of LCC and a new program called q3asm. LCC is a wonderful 
project -- a cross platform, cross compiling ANSI C compiler done in under 20K 
lines of code. Anyone interested in compilers should pick up a copy of &quot;A 
retargetable C compiler: design and implementation&quot; by Fraser and Hanson.
</p> 
<p>...</p> 
<p>The drawback is performance. It will probably perform somewhat like QC. 
Most of the heavy lifting is still done in the builtin functions for path 
tracing and world sampling, but you could still hurt yourself by looping over 
tons of objects every frame. Yes, this does mean more load on servers, but I am 
making some improvements in other parts that I hope will balance things to 
about the way Q2 was on previous generation hardware.</p> 
<p>There is also the amusing avenue of writing hand tuned virtual assembly 
assembly language for critical functions...</p> 
<p>I think this is The Right Thing.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>John Carmack's Talk on Shooters</strong>&nbsp; [6:38 AM EST]<strong>
<br> </strong>On this week's Shooters we will air a video presentation of the 
talk John Carmack gave at the FRAG2 about Quake III Arena and related topics. 
The presentation will be uncut, with part two of the talk to air the following 
week. The show will air this Thursday at 7:00 PM Eastern time, and in the 
archive thereafter. After the two part Carmack talk, on November 19 our guest 
will be id Software's Paul Steed, and we will also post the RealPlayer video of 
the talk he gave at the FRAG2 on the models in Quake III Arena (see next story 
for more on that).</p> 
<p><strong>More on Carmack &amp; Steed's FRAG2 Talks</strong>&nbsp; [6:38 AM

<p><strong>Newer Blood2 Demo &amp; Shogo Patch Soon</strong>&nbsp; [6:38 AM

</strong>A multiplayer Blood2 demo, a newer version of the 
single player Blood2 demo to offer some speed and feel improvements over the 
original, as well as a newer Alpha Shogo patch are all in the works over at 
Monolith high command (thanks Apache atBlood2.com). Monolith's Brian Goble's 
.plan has an update on these subjects, mentioning the Blood2 update <em>may</em>
 be available as a patch, rather than a full download, and will be out &quot;a 
few days after the full version officially goes gold. :),&quot; which he says 
could be &quot;any hour now!&quot; Monolith CEOJason Hall's .plan also has word 
on the optimizations recently added to Blood2, and the updated demo, and also 
addresses the potential for anger at a second large download. Finally, Blood2 
project leader Jay &quot;Shade&quot; Wilson updatedhis .plan with more on all 
of this. Shade's update is huge, giving word on where to send bug reports (
b2demobugs@lith.com), and addressing some of the concerns he's received, 
touching on Speed, Mouselook, Mouse Sensitivity, Crash bugs, Limb Loss (lack 
thereof), Blood (not enough), and The levels are &quot;too techie.&quot; Here's 
the conclusion where he talks about what's in the works:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>***New, Improved, Blood 2 Demo*** </p> 
<p>Yes, we will be releasing a new and improved Blood 2 demo, mainly so people 
can see the speed improvements. The details are undecided at this point, but we 
will probably release it shortly after the game goes gold.</p> 
<p>***Multiplayer Demo*** </p> 
<p>For those who only play multiplayer, yes, we will be releasing a 
multiplayer demo. We won't release it until we get the updated net code that 
Shogo is testing out and integrate it into B2's code, which will be the Blood 2 
point release, which should arrive in late November, early December at the 
latest.</p> 
<p>***Blood 2 Final*** </p> 
<p>No, we haven't gone gold yet, but we are very close. We've frozen all 
content and are trying to work out the last of the bugs. That's all I'll say 
for now. :)</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>NT PS/2 Mouse Rate Revisited</strong>&nbsp; [6:38 AM EST]<strong>
<br> </strong>A follow-up on the post from yesterday about a fix that allows 
you to set a PS/2 mouse under Windows NT to a higher sampling rate, I've 
received a couple of letters confirming that this does work, though g1zm0 sends 
a warning to have NT4 SP4 installed, or you risk a B.S.O.D. (Blue Screen O' 
Death) at startup. To recap, thisreplacement system file for NT (31 KB) by 
Espen Blikstad should allow the changes made with the WinNT PS/2 Mouse Rate 
adjuster to take effect, which can be verified using the Mouse Rate Checker 
utility. Squeak!</p>

</strong>Tim

Thanks Randy Perry. Here'sa local copy (2.1 MB) on GamesNET FTP. Here's the 
scoop:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It's now available for download HERE. The Epic Deathmatch servers will be 
shut down for the night, to provide more bandwidth for downloads.</p> 
<p><strong>The testing is going well </strong></p> 
<p>Ok, ok, you can stop now, that's enough testers. :) Server performance has 
definitely improved since I last benchmarked it. My dual-processor Pentium 
II-300 is serving a 20-player game, copying 600 megs across the network, and 
running a 3dfx Unreal client at 800x600. The server is keeping up a steady 15 
fps. I have more optimizations planned, though.</p> 
<p>On my 28.8K connection, gameplay has remained pretty smooth until I get 
into a firefight with 5-6 people, at which point the movement of other players 
starts to become unsmooth. We should be able to improve this significantly 
further in 200, with two protocol improvements. First, I'll be improving the 
scheme for managing temporary objects like projectiles, which should reduce 
their bandwidth usage by aroune 30%. Second, Steve Polge and I working out a 
new variable priority predictor/corrector scheme for transmitting the movement 
of other players.</p> 
<p><strong>Testing 219 </strong></p> 
<p>I have an Unreal 219 server up and running at unreal://208.212.53.3/ in 
case a few people want to help test. You can join in and play with 218; it's 
fully compatible. 219 should be available soon, unless new bugs are discovered.

<p><strong>Roger Wilco</strong>&nbsp; [4:01 PM EST]<strong><br>
</strong>Roger 
Wilco is a new program to allow four-way real-time voice communication in 
computer games if you have a supported full-duplex sound card. The sound 
quality described as the equivalent of a CB radio, and the program takes up so 
little bandwidth they say you can even use it with a 28.8 modem. I haven't 
tried it myself, but have a report from my bro RedAnt that it worked on his 56K 
modem connection just fine. Thanks RedAnt and Andrew Smith for word on this. 
The program is in beta, so you must supply your email to register, and they say 
a version that supports ten players at once is in the works. Here's the poop 
from their page:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Roger Wilco is a stand-alone application that allows you and your friends 
to talk to each other while playing multiplayer online games. It works with 
most existing games such as Quake II, DIABLO, and StarCraft, and does not 
require subscriptions or dedicated servers. Indeed, it works with 28.8K modems, 
because thats what a lot of people have! It seems to be part of the game, and 
lets you talk to friends and enemies instead of typing messages.</p>

<p><strong>PS/2 Mouse Sampling on NT Fix?</strong>&nbsp; [1:16 PM EST]<strong>
<br> </strong>Although there's a registry setting in Windows NT for mouse 
sampling rate, experimentation with theMouse Rate Checker seems to indicate 
that adjusting it manually, or with thePS2 Mouse Rate NT utility, does not 
actually change the rate at which your PS/2 mouse samples (theWin95/98 version 
works fine). NowEspen Blikstad sends along a replacement system file for NT (31 
KB) that he says will allow rate changing on PS/2 mice under NT (caution - this 
is untested by me). Here's the explanation:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I have built a new version of i8042prt.sys for Windows NT which uses the 
SampleRate value in the registry. With this update it is possible to use the 
PS2RATE utility to adjust the samplerate.</p> </blockquote>

great, but what about fragging scientists?!</p> 
<p>In this game, players are divided into two teams: Soldiers and Scientists.
</p> 
<p>The soldiers goal is to waste the scientists in the level, while the 
scientists goal is to make a break for the exits, and get out of the area.</p> 
<p>Sounds easy, right? The scientists are fodder, and the Soldiers will eat 
them alive...unless the scientists get the HEV suits on. Then it's assbeating 
time.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>This program is a QuakeWorld Master Browser for intranet use only. I guess 
there is not really much to explain, just configure your QW server to register 
and send a heartbeat to the master browser. (e.g. &quot;setmaster 
192.168.1.1:27000&quot;) You can use GameSpy to get a list of all registered 
servers. Please read the GameSpy documentation how you should add a new master 
browser.</p> 
<p>Currently, this version is restricted to 192.168.0.0/16, so you can only 
use this program on your intranet. If you want to use other intranet numbers, 
just let me know, and I will add them.</p> </blockquote>

Image of the day is me getting my just deserts from Hiro Polishmoto (<em>
&quot;I see your schwartz is as big as mine.&quot;</em>). I actually made it 
past the first round in that All-Star Doom tourney, but managed to take my two 
losses in the double-elim dealie in a royal manbeating from DuvalMagic from RBR 
and John Romero, ironic since I threatened to practice to regain lost skill and 
crush him this year (as I said before, my mouth wrote a check that my mouse 
couldn't cash). That certainly wasn't for lack of support: I actually broke 
down laughing in the middle of the match a couple of times as the small crowd 
started chanting BLUE! BLUE! BLUE! (try and maintain your composure while 
that's going on). Even a rooting section didn't help. Last year: 50-22 on 
Map07, this year 50-24 on Map01. No promises about practicing for next year, 
John (but don't rule it out either). John seems a bit dubious about my return 
challenge to him in Rocket Arena 2. I forgot to mention the oddball Max Smart 
reference someone actually caught the other day (wow!). I'll be heading back to 
the BlueTower sometime this evening, it's possible that the next update will be 
after midnight. Oh, yeah (to finish an amazingly self-indulgent OotB), Happy 
Birthday Mama Blue.</p> <strong>Saturday, October 31, 1998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

updatedhis .plan prior to the release with a Blood2/Shogo update:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The demo is another hefty one...weighing in at a gory 36 Meg. It's got 2 
levels, 6 weapons, some good baddies, and even a few cheat codes--but I'm not 
telling what they are... :)</p> 
<p>The full version of Blood2 is oh-so-close to being done and it is looking 
really good...the in-game cinematics are awesome! Being able to play any one of 
The Chosen characters is really cool too.</p> 
<p>After Blood2 ships, I'll take a quick break and then add all of the new 
Shogo multiplayer options into the wizards. Mike and I are hoping to add some 
cool new connection features too.</p> </blockquote>

<p>ftp://ftp.maison-otaku.net/pub/shogo/patch/SoftSnd.dll</p> 
<p>Be warned; that's my personal machine and a) I've put limits on the FTP 
load, and b) if it gets pounded into the ground under downloads, I'll be highly 
annoyed. :)</p> 
<p>Hopefully it'll be mirrored to Blues and Planetshogo and whatnot soon. :)

day). It's hard to believe this is the same Dallas I visited a couple of months 
ago, it's less than 100 degrees, and you can actually walk without stepping on 
crickets. The layout here at the FRAG2 is amazing, I'm eager to hear some 
estimates on the number of attendees and computers... I would have to say it's 
easily ass much as a boatload... easily the largest such event I've ever seen.
