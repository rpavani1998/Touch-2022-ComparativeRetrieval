<p> </p> 
<p>Given the prevalence of DirectX nowadays, we tend to forget that 10 years 
ago an all-out war was being waged between Microsoft and Silicon Graphics in 
the field of 3D APIs. The two companies were both trying to win over 
developers, with Microsoft using its financial muscle and SGI relying on its 
experience and its reputation in the field of real-time 3D. In this modern 
David-versus-Goliath battle, the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo; won a precious ally 
in one of the most famous game developers&ndash;-Mr. John Carmack. In part due 
to the success of the Quake engine, solid support for OpenGL became important 
enough to motivate makers of 3D cards to provide complete drivers. In fact, it 
gave 3dfx one of its early advantages and knocked ATI to the back of the pack 
as it struggled with its OpenGL support.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft was starting from scratch, and the learning curve was 
steep. So, for several years, Direct3D&rsquo;s capabilities were beyond the 
curve, with an interface that many programmers found a lot more confusing than 
OpenGL&rsquo;s. But nobody can accuse Microsoft of being easily discouraged. 
With each new version of Direct3D, it gradually began to catch up with OpenGL. 
The engineers in Redmond worked very hard to bring performance up to its rival 
API&rsquo;s level.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A turning point was reached with DirectX 8, released in 2001. For the first 
time, Microsoft&rsquo;s API did more than just copy from SGI. It actually 
introduced innovations of its own like support for vertex and pixel shaders. 
SGI, whose main source of revenue was the sale of expensive 3D workstations, 
was in a bad position, having failed to foresee that the explosion of 3D cards 
for gamers would prompt ATI and Nvidia to move into the professional market 
with prices so low (due to economies of scale) that SGI couldn&rsquo;t keep up. 
OpenGL&rsquo;s development was also handicapped by bitter disputes among its 
proponents. Since the ARB&mdash;the group in charge of ratifying the 
API&rsquo;s development&mdash;included many different, competing companies, it 
was hard to reach agreement on the features to be added to the API. Instead, 
each company promoted its own agenda. Conversely, Microsoft was working solely 
with ATI and Nvidia, using its weight to cast a deciding vote if there was 
disagreement.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With DirectX 9, Microsoft managed to strike a decisive victory, imposing 
its API on developers. Only John Carmack and those who insisted on portability 
remained faithful to OpenGL. But their ranks dwindled. And yet a reversal of 
fortunes was still possible. It had happened with Web browsers, after all. Even 
when a company has maneuvered itself into a near monopoly, if it rests on its 
laurels, it&rsquo;s not all that rare for a competitor to rise from his ashes. 
So when the Khronos group took over OpenGL two years ago, many hopes were 
rekindled with all eyes on the upcoming SIGGRAPH conference that year.</p> 
<p>Last month, Khronos was to have announced OpenGL 3, a major revision of the 
API that&rsquo;s supposed to catch up with Microsoft, which was also scheduled 
to launch its next-gen DirectX 11 API. But things didn&rsquo;t really go as 
planned.<br>

<p>Sadly, I agree by the author's opinions. Not simply for, but because it 
still give away the idea that PC gaming cannot be considered serious..... 
Unless you're using Windows, which is proprietary, the only viable alternative 
cannot be used because of the fear of losing compability. I just hope this can 
be remedied before Microsoft becomes.... Unreasonable and becomes power 
hungry..... If it isn't already. Look at how Windows systems cost now compared 
to the the alternative.</p> johnbilicki  09/16/2008 10:39 AM <br>

<p>DirectX 11 will be available on Windows 7 and Vista? Great news indeed! 
Normal noobs will be able to own super noobs who are standing around looking at 
over-detailed shrubs.<br>
<br>
As for real gamers, we'll stick with XP until 
either Microsoft gets smart and clones XP and only adds on Aero or OpenGL gets 
it's act together and Linux becomes a viable gaming platform. It would be nice 
if it became a viable anything-other-then-a-web-server viable platform though. 
Linux gurus, feel free to let us know in sixty years that I won't have to 
explain to my grandmother how to type console commands to install a copy of 
Opera.<br>
<br>
OpenGL can go screw backwards compatibility, look what it's 
done to (competent) web designers who are stuck dealing with Internet Explorer.
<br><br>
All the bad news about DirectX, OpenGL, and DRM makes me wonder if 
these companies want us to pirate the hell out of everything. At this rate 
&quot;next generation&quot; consoles might actually become the next generation 
consoles!</p> jimmysmitty  09/16/2008 11:03 AM <br>

see at DX11 graphic cardhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card on the market.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought the article said that DX11 is supposed 
to be compatable with previous gen hardware.<br>
<br>
I know the Gemoetry 
Shader with Tesselation is already in all of the ATI Radeon HD GPUs so thats 
one thing it will support.<br>
<br>
But no SP 5.0 support. I have heard that 
Intels GPU, Larrabee will support DX11. So that would mean late 2009/2010 will 
have at least one and that should mean that ATIs HD5K series and nVidias next 
step should includ support if they were smart and jumped on the wagon early.

<p>OpenGL may not have gotten the changes it needed to compete with DirectX as 
a gaming graphics API. But then you have people like Tim Sweeney telling us 
that graphics APIs are not going to be relevant that much longer 
(http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/gpu-sweeney-interview.ars).<br>
<br>

Direct3D 10 has changed very little in the industry so far, predictably only a 
very small number of games us it. And those who do can do most of it on 
Direct3D 9 as well. Maybe MS learned by now that releasing a new API on only 
the latest platform is a huge mistake, but it will still be a while before 
people will adapt their new API. And if Tim Sweeney's predictions come true, it 
will likely not happen at all.</p> martel80  09/16/2008 12:04 PM <br>

<br>
I have been able to 
&quot;accidentally&quot; (because I'm no Linux guru, you know) install Opera 
through the Synaptic Package Manager on Ubuntu. So please, stop talking 
nonsense. <br>
The process was a bit different but overall faster than under 
Windows.

<p>dx 10 may not appear major but for devs its actually is.. no more checking 
cap bits.. that is a big improvment. dx10 is alot more strict in terms of what 
the drivers should do and thats good. doing away with fixed functions is also 
great<br>
<br>
however hardware tesselation if huge.. dx 11 also allows for 
hardware voxel rendering /raymarching thru compute shaders and alot of other 
stuff.. as apis become more general [as dx 10/11 are] im sure the pace of new 
apis: will slow down, but that's not a indicator that pc gaming is dying (un 
informed people have claimed that the pc is dead since the ps1)<br>
<br>
as for 
the windows/other platforms discussion, it is not the fault of microsoft that 
there is no viable alternative on other platforms. if someone chose to compete 
with microsoft, they could. but no one seems willing. what really should be 
done is a port/implementation of dx11 in open source..<br>
<br>
however, in the 
cut throat buisness of game engines[epic vs whats-their-name anyone?] and gpu 
drivers, i seriously doubt that open source systems will ever be at the 
forefront of gaming</p> phantom93  09/16/2008 1:38 PM <br>

<p>DX11 is compatiable with DX10 hardware. It should work when it is released 
unless they have bugs.</p> spaztic7  09/16/2008 3:08 PM <br>

<p>From my understanding, all HD4800 serious are DX11 compatible... and the 
HD4800 line is ray tracing compatible at ray tracings frame cap. I do not know 
about the 4600 line, but I don&rsquo;t see why they wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>

<p>ow PC gameing is dieing allright the major game componies are starting to 
squeese out the PC games from there production list useing the excuse that they 
are loosing money through pirecy but what they are realy doing is cutting out 
one version forcing PC gamers to evolve into console players<br>
And from this 
article I get the impresion that microsoft has a hand in it aswell by making 
sure that the console games end up running better or as good as PC games<br>
I 
think if the origenal Opengl was alowed to proceed years ago and if the follow 
up was taken and there wasnt any sabotage happening then the PC and its 
performance with mutly CPU GPU and the tecnolegy evolving with the progamers 
and propper apis in this area would have left the console market in the shade 
but this way Microsoft is eliminating other similar competion Apple<br>
To cut 
to the chace Apple and OpenGl is getting the Microsft squeese and who has an 
interest in a console product :-)<br>
I guess I might be one of the old 
dinosorse but I still am a PC gamer through and through even though I am 
grampar foda I love buiding PC units and playing well I havent been to a net 
game in a couple of years Pizza and beer he he heee But Il be buggered If I 
will lie down and die because of big buisness<br>

If your

is still around) for her.

Have fun making a viable open alternative to a closed source 
api that runs really close to the closed source kernel of the closed source OS. 
To even get access to the necessary functions you'd have to cripple your 
efforts with M$ bs.</p> cjl  09/16/2008 5:07 PM <br>

OK. A decent windows gaming 
machine can be had for around $800, the same one in Linux is $700, and you 
can't buy a mac for that price other than the pitiful (for anything like games) 
mac mini.

<p>If MS was smart they should release the xbox3 that is fully dx11 compliant 
several years before Windows 7 is released. That will ultimately increase the 
library of dx11 games, real FULL dx11 games incompatible with dx9. For dx11 to 
move forward and windows 7 to take hold, dx9 must die COMPLETELY. The dx11 
games will then force people to upgrade to windows 7. As far as I know, dx11 
features is not possible on the open platforms like the PS3 or 4 so 
multiplatform games will always look and run better (provided that dx11 does 
what it says it will do) on the xbox3 thus annihilating the console market.</p>

<p>Great article- very interesting reading. I'm glad I didn't stop coming to 
THG.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
It would be interesting (if possible at all) to make 
an unbiased API performance shootout. I know that professional 3d programs like 
max and maya run much smoother on d3d even when run on the non-crippled version 
of OpenGL (on workstation cards). Is this due to particular software 
optimizations or just speed deficiency of OGL?<br>
<br>
Also, you said that 
opengl 3.0 is more like 2.2, but you also said that it barely caches up with 
dx10. I find these to statements contradictory. I'm under impression that OGL 
3.0 is in ~2003 while dx10 is ~2007. opengl 2.1 is in ~1999. How can .1 
increase bring ~2007 things while staying 5 years behind. Or is my logic simply 
flawed here?<br>
<br>
Also, for 3ds Max specific, you are able to have real 
time shadows and lightning conditions in viewports, but only under d3d. Am I to 
understand that openGL can do the same, but the AutoDesk programmers chose not 
to implement them? I always assumed that ogl simply couldn&rsquo;t due to 
obsoleteness.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, THG needs more of these articles. Latest 
GPU roundup was another massive success.</p> Anonymous  09/16/2008 6:47 PM <br>

<p>I use several AutoDesk products for engineering and AutoDesk made it clear 
about 1.5 years ago that their 3D products would only support DirectX in the 
future. This has already occurred for Inventor running on Vista, so I do not 
know how far the other products are. Their timeline may also be affected since 
those products have not been under the direct control of AutoDesk for quite as 
long (3ds Max and Maya).</p> <br>
