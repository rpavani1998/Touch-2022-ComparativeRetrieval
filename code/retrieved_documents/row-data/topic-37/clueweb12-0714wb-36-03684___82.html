<h2> DirectX 10 Hardware Is Now Obsolete 373 </h2>  Posted by Zonk on Saturday

from the shouldn't-have-blinked dept.  
ela_gervaise writes<i>&quot;SIGGRAPH 2007 was the stage where Microsoft dropped 
the bomb, informing gamers that the currently available DirectX 10 hardwarewill 
not support the upcoming DirectX 10.1 in Vista SP1. In essence, all current 
DX10 hardware is now obsolete. But don't get too upset just yet: 'Gamers 
shouldn't fret too much - 10.1 adds virtually nothing that they will care about 
and, more to the point, adds almost nothing that developers are likely to care 
about. The spec revision basically makes a number of things that are optional 
in DX10 compulsory under the new standard - such as 32-bit floating point 
filtering, as opposed to the 16-bit current. 4xAA is a compulsory standard to 
support in 10.1, whereas graphics vendors can pick and choose their 
anti-aliasing support currently. We suspect that the spec is likely to be 
ill-received. Not only does it require brand new hardware, immediately creating 
a minuscule sub-set of DX10 owners, but it also requires Vista SP1, and also 
requires developer implementation.'&quot;</i>

<p></p>  On many games, I can run at a much higher resolution without AA than 
with. In my opinion, high resolution &gt; antialiasing. This is especially true 
on displays like LCDs, which have a fixed pixel size. Running at a lower 
resolution than native will add scaling artefacts, and AA can make these even 
worse. Of course, the spec only make support for AA mandatory; it doesn't force 
you to use it. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

<p></p>  i take it you're not a game developer and/but a linux user yes?  All 
serious gamers are happily running Windows XP with latest service pack. I have 
not yet seen a single gamer liking Vista unless he/she got a true monster 
machine which you can't tell difference whatever you do. Some game companies 
have guts to say &quot;We do NOT support Vista at least until SP1 ships&quot;.
<br> <br>
I am running OS X here and all my games are OS X native but you don't 
need DX 10 enabled Vista to browse game forums :) <br>
<br>
The absolute need 
for Vista to run DX 10 killed it from the beginning. The DX 10 and Vista 
respectively. I am sure lots of game developers who coded direct3d only stuff 
questioned their choice and started to look to recent OpenGL advancements.<br>

<br>I am hoping they finally started to figure risks of using a MS only 
technology rather than platform independent, documented frameworks such as 
OpenGL, OpenAL.<br>
<br>
Did MS care to explain what kind of 
undocumented,hidden quantum computing (!) routines in Vista needed for DX 10 
running? :) Or did they simply state &quot;We can't sell Vista otherwise, those 
FPS racing teens will buy it for DX10&quot;. I think they overlooked to gaming 
community, they weren't that stupid.<br>

<blockquote>  I am hoping they finally started to figure risks of using a MS

the single biggest problem with porting Windows games to Mac or Linux is lack 
of DirectX support, so why do developers even use this broken technology to 
begin with instead of OpenGL? Is it easier to program for? Presumably Windows 
also supports OpenGL so why not make games that are easily ported like id does?
<p></p> 
<blockquote>  Or did they simply state &quot;We can't sell Vista otherwise,

obviously that is the reason. There's no reason Windows 2000 Pro wasn't 
sufficient to run today's modern games if they had just released the latest 
DirectX libraries for it, but then they wouldn't have sold Windows XP and 
dragged gamers into the wonderful world of DRM and activation. I was more than 
happy to keep using Windows 2000 Pro on my gaming machine and didn't need any 
of the features of Windows XP. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

 I've posted it before, but 
never really got a response. So here goes. My take is we have to look back at 
history. Some will argue that the reason they choose directx today is, 
supposedly, some things are easier vs opengl.<br>
<br>
But way back when, I 
always wondered why a company like valve took an opengl engine and ported it to 
directx (for hl1) when no one would argue that directx was better then. Hell, 
carmack had his famous open letter to microsoft to ensure support for opengl. 
Microsoft saw how big gaming was becoming, and the best way to tie your users 
to one platform was to tie the developers to one platform. If hl1 was opengl 
only when it exploded, maybe companies like ati would have got in gear and 
developed better (i.e. not shit) opengl drivers. Either that or miss on out the 
huge hit that was/is counterstrike. I'm not saying valve was the lynchpin in 
how things ended up. But if big players like them stuck to opengl, more 
companies might be willing to port as their games would be opengl based anyway.
<br> <br>
So why valve did that at that time I'll never understand, but 
microsoft understood the market in this case, all too well.<br>
<br>
Why aren't 
there more game developers like id software who actually care? Carmack has said 
in the past he tries to keep everything crossplatform not because it's 
necessarily the profitable move, but because 'it's a good thing'. Parent Share

 Mind you, it's been almost a decade since last I had anything to 
do with game development, so take this with a grain of salt. Or to put it 
otherwise, major talking out the arse follows.<br>
<br>
That said, AFAIK 
DirectX offers more features than just rendering. If you'll run 
&quot;dxdiag&quot;, you'll see that it has more tabs and more DLLs listed than 
just Direct3D and DirectDraw. There's also stuff like DirectSound, DirectInput, 
DirectPlay, and a bunch of other stuff.<br>
<br>
So if you want to make your 
game portable by not using any DirectX stuff, well, you'll have to write your 
own equivalent for that other stuff. That translates directly into higher 
development costs, plus God knows if your own stuff will work as well, and what 
bugs will it have.<br>
<br>
(We all like to pretend that we can write better 
code in one afternoon than MS in 10 years, but that's actually hardly ever the 
case. That's more usually just a mixture of hubris and an excuse to write one's 
own code instead of learning how to use a library. The former is simply more 
fun than the latter. Don't get me wrong, there _is_ stuff out there that does 
work better than MS's stuff, but that one too wasn't written in a day or two.)
<br> <br>
You also face the issue that, traditionally, most graphics cards have 
been optimized for DirectX, since that's what the lion's share of the market 
uses. Traditionally, Nvidia tends to do well in OpenGL too, ATI less so. (Plus, 
if you actually plan to port it to Linux, there ATI's drivers traditionally are 
an inside joke. Not a funny one, either.) So the choice to go OpenGL instead of 
Direct3D also means that a bunch of gamers will post &quot;OMG, your game has 
crap frame rates&quot; or &quot;OMG, your game doesn't work on my 
computer.&quot; And be quite justified in doing so, btw.<br>
<br>
So, there you 
go. As long as 99% of the PC gamers are running Windows, it makes no sense to 
annoy those to appease the fragmented rest of the market.<br>
<br>
Being able 
to emulate or dual-boot Windows... well, takes even more out of the motivation 
there. Windows compatibility is how OS/2 committed seppuku, after all. If OS/2 
people can just emulate your program, well, there's no reason for you to put 
any effort and money into porting it. The same applies to the Mac and Linux 
market currently, to some extent. Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

<br>  You missed the root cause of DirectX's success, which is that Microsoft 
has been a lot more quickly responsive and to the concerns of developers and 
hardware designers. They listen to the API fixes and new features that game 
developers ask them for, and they work with graphics card manufacturers to 
expose new capabilities as soon as they are available, and release new DirectX 
SDKs every few months. Meanwhile OpenGL's committee decisions are always a step 
behind.

<p></p>  Did MS care to explain what kind of undocumented,hidden quantum

<p>I can explain that one. I read a post a while back where someone who was in 
the know explained it (it was on one of the Microsoft blogs, I think). DX 10 
contained virtualized graphics memory (that may not be the right term). Like 
system memory, each program would get it's own addresses and you could page in 
and out graphics data. This is a big feature. It also required kernel and GDI 
changes. This is why DX 10 could only run on Vista.</p> 
<p>Someone (I think it was NVidia), couldn't get it done in time. </p> 
<p>So it ended up optional in the spec (or moved out completely, I don't 
remember). The people who did do it (ATI, I think) got an unfair shake. Now 
without that feature, there is no technical reason DX 10 can't be run on XP 
without a few small innocuous changes. But they don't have time at this point 
(or a business reason).</p> 
<p>DX 10 being only on Vista was based on a very valid techical reason... that 
they gave up on and removed.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

<br>  I hate to gripe, but there are a few glaring misconceptions that need to 
be addressed in your post. Mainly this claim that DirectX/Direct3D is 
&quot;pointing and clicking in Visual Studio.&quot; You're probably thinking 
more along the lines of XNA, but core Direct3D is a pretty basic interface to 
the graphics hardware (you're dealing with vertex buffers, texture objects, 
vertex/pixel shaders and their associated inputs, and a number of state 
parameters). Functionality wise it offers essentially what OpenGL does, except 
wrapped up in a platform-specific COM interface. There is a higher level 
library called D3DX that adds some helper functions for loading textures and 
meshes and doing vector and matrix math, but even that's quite a ways from the 
&quot;pointing and clicking in Visual Studio&quot; you mentioned.<br>
<br>

DirectX isn't &quot;easier&quot; than OpenGL/OpenAL (in fact, OpenAL is higher 
level than DirectSound or XAudio, if you've ever used any of those APIs). The 
extra price of OpenGL comes not from &quot;the fact they are intended for real 
developers&quot; (whatever that means), but rather from the fact that it's not 
exactly the cleanest API at the moment (but that will change in a few months 
when OpenGL 3.0 finally hits). In combing through this thread I'm surprised I 
haven't seen mentioned that one big reason Direct3D took off over OpenGL on 
Windows is because OpenGL is notoriously difficult to write stable, performant 
drivers for. An article in issue #2 of the OpenGL newsletter mentioned how the 
old object model caused unnecessary driver overhead, for instance:
http://www.opengl.org/pipeline/article/vol002_3/ [opengl.org] <br>
<br>
Back in 
the late 90's when all this stuff was taking off, major games like Half-Life, 
Quake 2, and Unreal had several graphics renderers encapsulated in DLLs. 
Half-Life had software, OpenGL, and Direct3D. Quake 2 had software, OpenGL, and 
I think PowerVR or something. Unreal had a heck of a lot of different 
renderers, I know software, D3D, Glide, and OpenGL were among them. They did 
this because driver performance and compatibility was such a big issue back 
then, by writing to more than one API they could cover all the bases (card X 
doesn't run GL well but does run D3D well? Then we support that scenario. Card 
Y runs D3D poorly but does GL well? We support that, too). At the end of the 
day, the major graphics vendors ended up putting out really excellent D3D 
drivers and that helped the API out significantly. D3D was the only 
hardware-agnostic solution back then aside from OpenGL (ATI wasn't implementing 
Glide), and the API mapped to the general hardware case well enough that it was 
relatively easy for most vendors to write good drivers for.<br>
<br>
Like 
pretty much everyone else who isn't a Microsoft employee, I do wish Microsoft 
would have adopted OpenGL as the sole hardware graphics standard instead of 
running off and creating their own thing and creating yet another obstacle to 
porting games over to different platforms (and to be clear, there are MANY more 
issues to porting games to different platforms than I/O APIs, for some reason 
I'll never understand that point is lost on a lot of people), but painting game 
developers who use DirectX as corporate Microsoft shills isn't the most honest 
or productive characterization of why things are the way they are. What is 
productive is looking at the technical flaws present in OpenGL and rectifying 
them, which is something the Khronos ARB Working Group has done an excellent 
job of.<br>
<br>
As far as id is concerned, Carmack is using the Direct3D-only 
Xbox 360 as his benchmark development platform at the moment (you can go back 
to his Quakecon 2005 speech for a reference on that). That doesn't mean he's 
turned into a D3D fanboy, the Windows version of Rage is still going to be 
OpenGL. What it does mean is, these days he's probably more concerned with 
things like efficient multicore utilization, robust and productive content 
developer toolsets, and having a nice stable platform with excellent developer 
support as a testbed (something Mic Read the rest of this comment... <br>

 You hear about 
it for a few reasons:<br>
<br>
1) Some people (like many on Slashdot) hate MS 
and want them to fail, thus look for anything that makes them look bad and make 
sure it gets page time.<br>
<br>
2) For some reason, some people had the 
perception that because DX10 was launched with Vista, that made it special and 
thus it wouldn't be changed for a long time. Never mind that MS has released a 
version of DirectX that has added a significant feature (as in something that 
needs more hardware) every 1-2 years in the past.<br>
<br>
3) Perhaps because 
of this many people bought in to the DX10 cards expecting them to be 
&quot;futureproof&quot;. Again no idea why anyone would think that given 
graphics cards are the things that evolve the fastest and thus obsolete the 
fastest.<br>
<br>
Also I'm not so sure they said it wouldn't support it. Maybe 
I misread their slides, but all I saw was they said that &quot;upcoming 
hardware&quot; will support it. That statement doesn't mean that current 
hardware won't.<br>
<br>
Either way, much ado about nothing. Games will 
continue to be made to support whatever hardware is common on the market. Game 
companies love all the flashy new toys, but they are in bussiness to make money 
and you do that by selling games that run on the actual systems that are out 
there. That means so long as most peopel don't have cards capable of using a 
new standard, they won't require it (though they may support it to give mroe 
eye candy to the eairly adopters).<br>
<br>
Heck, right now you'll discover 
that a great number of games require nothing more than a DirectX 8 accelerator. 
That's a card like a GeForce 4 Ti fore example. Basically that means shader 
model 1.1 hardware. While many games support 2.0 and 3.0 (DX 9.0 and 9.0c 
respectively) you'll find that a good number don't require 2.0, and very few 
require 3.0. The reason is that there are still a lot of people using older 
cards. Not every one upgrades every year. Thus game makers have to take that in 
to account.<br>
<br>
It's not like the second 10.1 comes out developers are 
going to say &quot;Ok, everyone better upgrade because this is all we 
support!&quot; They could try, and they'd just go out of business and other, 
smarter, developers would support the hardware that more people have.<br>
<br>

Heck it is a pretty recent phenomena that developers have stopped supporting 
Windows ME for games, and some still do. Why? Enough people still used it.

&quot;non-gaming&quot; PC. All this new hardware also required a bigger power 
supply, which wound up adding to my expenses. I wound up replacing my entire PC 
in order to save money. And since I was only upgrading for one game only it was 
difficult to upgrade for that alone, but I did so knowing my investment would 
last a year or two. Now Microsoft has announced DirectX 10.1 which makes all 
hardware for DirectX 10 obsolete. This made my previous investment from a month 
ago already worthless. To add salt to my wounds most of the features of 10.1 
were optional and did nothing to improve the product. PC Gaming is an enjoyable 
experience, although an expensive one. Hardware should last a minimum of 6 
months cutting edge, and about a year for not-the-best but playable.<br>
<br>

Bottom line America? Microsoft needs to realize that features need to be 
worthwhile and should always be optional. If they are truly worth it, they will 
be adopted as standard by the general public very quickly.<br>

 That 
DirectX 10.1 is incompatible with 10.0 (along with new WDDM interface) has been 
known for at least a year now. It's a bitlate [elitebastards.com] for people to 
be in shock about it.<br>
<br>
 Slashdot even covered it before [slashdot.org]. 
<br> <br>
 Just because Microsoft officially announced it at a conference 
doesn't *exactly* make it new news, since they made it very clear on roadmaps 
and everything else exactly what was going to happen, and why it wasn't the 
best idea ever to adopt DirectX 10.0 hardware, rather than hardware capable of 
10.1 (or 10.2) and whatever the new superset of OpenGL happened to be (3.0 as 
it turns out).<br>
<br>
 Also, the reason to bother [elitebastards.com] with 
DirectX 10.1 isn't so much that it offers &quot;brand new super features&quot; 
to games, but the WDDM 2.1 bits, which would allow for far finer-grained 
context switching and task management. Being able to immediately switch from 
rendering one small bit, to starting to render something else, which would 
theorhetically make all of the compiz/Aero type stuff be able to run much more 
smoothly in conjunction with real 3D rendering (ie, games, CAD).<br>
<br>
 It 
all seems an exercise in futility to me, as far as the &quot;DirectX 10&quot; 
hardware goes. I like faster, I like more features, but there just seems no 
real reason to upgrade beyond my Geforce 6800 for the price point (which I got 
18 months ago). Not to a 7800-series or comparable, and certainly not to an 
8x00 or upcoming 9x00 Geforce, unless driver stability improves dramatically, 
and they can add more real-world-useful features, particularly without the need 
for Windows Vista. I'm back using WinXP &quot;for a while&quot; again, but I 
generally won't buy hardware anymore unless it's a notable and drastic 
improvement in Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD.<br>
<br>
 I digress, but the point 
is, the news has already been covered before. If it apparently wasn't that 
attention-worthy a year ago, is it now? New DirectX versions *always* require 
brand new hardware, whereas most minor OpenGL revisions have almost always 
included new features that also work on old hardware (OpenGL 1.5's Vertex 
Buffer Objects humming along happily on a Geforce 256, for instance), and while 
full compliance is the best, all you really need to care about is if something 
implements certain clearly defined extensions, rather than wondering if Nvidia 
or ATI have 'misinterpreted' specifications over DirectX. Both have been panned 
in the past for 'creative' adoption of pixel shader standards and bizarre 
interpretations of DirectX 9.<br>
<br>
 I'd just hope that eventually, there's 
more actual competition again, and both companies (and new companies) actually 
respect and care about standards compliance and that both they and the 
standards bodies start to care about what customers actually doing with their 
hardware. Share twitter facebook <br>

DirectX.<br>

DirectX 10 and up is not just an accelerated video API but it 
is also a standard. Microsoft has completely eliminated the capability bits, or 
&quot;capbits&quot;, concept in order to ensure to developers that if they 
program a specific version of the standard that all of the functionality 
mandatory by that standard will be supported by the graphics hardware. No 
longer will a developer target DirectX9 or OpenGL2 and have to ask the hardware 
whether or not it supports a plethora of options and then have to completely 
branch their development umpteen ways to support different varieties. If a game 
targets DirectX10.1 then 4xAA is guaranteed to be there, period. If a game does 
not require 4xAA then it doesn't have to target DirectX10.1.<br>

First off.. technology is made obsolete??? no shit! Its hard to imagine the 
slashdot crowd finding this to be news. This doesn't mean your dx10 card 
doesn't work anymore, you don't install SP1 and your PC wont boot with DX10 
hardware. If you get upset every time people make revisions and improvements to 
software and hardware, I suggest you packup your computer and return it to 
avoid further heart ache. If you are an early adopter of the latest hardware 
and don't read any reviews (which all from memory said it will be some time 
before dx10 is going to matter) then thats your fault. Microsoft have explained 
in numerous interveiws (and documentation of course) how DX 10 will work, they 
even suggested 10.1 would be out BEFORE vista shipped. Graphics card features 
change ALL THE TIME, you have to write miles of CAPS checking code and render 
paths to support the zoo of cards and features. Now with DX10 they roll all the 
features up and any DX 10.x card will support the featuers, even if you write a 
DX 10.0 and DX 10.1 path, its only two options you have to support. You didn't 
see &quot;ATI MAKES LAST CARD OBSOLETE BY INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCT&quot;, even 
though those changes could be far, far more difficult to develop for by having 
a bunch of changed caps and maybe even a few new proprietary ones. A fixed 
feature set is what allows developers to squeze out every drop of performance 
from PS2 hardware to make amazing looking graphics, even though your mobile 
phone might have more processing power available to it. And lastly.. people who 
mock the, apparent, modest real world improvments dx10 is offering.. what is 
your point? Intel brings out a new processor every x months with ~1-3% 
improvements, by your logic they should just stop bothering making new

 One thing that 10.1 DX addresses is the Sound APIs that

360 is being added into 10.1 DX, and this is more of what DX 10.1 is about than 
anything else.<br>

Sadly though, sound is one area Vista gets no credit, 
yet is one of the best selling points of Vista.<br>

With the new Audio 
subsystem in Vista, if you are running 5.1 or higher you can turn on your Mic 
and it will auto tune the speakers and environment sounds for an outstanding 
experience.<br>
<br>
Another great thing about Sound in Vista is that even with 
an old AC'97 sound card and just stereo speakers on a desktop or laptop, the 
sound fidelity is significantly better than XP or OS X by several factors. For 
example a Wav,mp3,wma played on the same hardware and same speakers will sound 
incredibly more rich and defined on Vista than when you are playing it in XP. 
Even putting the same speakers on a Mac and 'trying' get the fidelity up, the 
sound quality was NOT even close to what Vista was doing with an old sound card.
<br> <br>
And DX10.1 adds back in DirectX level APIs for game developers. <br>

<br>If anyone really wants to understand the Audio in Vista, do a search on 
Vista Audio Subsystem, or Sonar Vista. There are great technical pieces on why 
Vista redid the Audio system and also some good examples of why developers of 
audio products like Sonar continue to choose MS and Vista as their platform of 
choice for high quality production. Share twitter facebook <br>

 The summary and the Inquirer article are, well, wrong. 
<br> <br>
Microsoft announced 10.1 as a side-by-side update - DirectX 10 is <b>
not</b> obsolete, they are both fully supported. Developers and manufacturers 
have the option of coding for 10.1 or sticking with 10. The real quote:
<p></p>  Direct3D 10.1 is an incremental, side-by-side update to Direct3D 10.0 
that provides a series of new rendering features that will be available in an

OpenGL, Direct3D 9, Direct3D 10 or Direct3D 10.1. Which one do you choose? 
Which one has the largest market? Do you choose Direct3D 9 and not be able to 
take full advantage of the hardware? Do you choose Direct3D 10.1 and hope 
everyone upgrades to new video cards? Do you choose Direct3D 10 and hope people

 What it means now 
is Lost Planet should support 9, 10 AND 10.1. It's not any of being

support all 3 types then good for them, but if not, they have to choose. There 
is alot of money needed to develop for all three API's, if your company can

<p>OpenGL is the only choice that makes sense for completely new games. Why? 
Because mobile phones are starting to support OpenGL ES, and it's a lot easier 
to port a game from OpenGL to OpenGL ES than from DirectX. This means that, in 
a decade, once you've stopped raking in the money from the initial release, the 
expansion packs, and the budget release, you can start all over again selling 
it for mobile phones which are now more powerful than the desktop computers at 
the time of the original release. Unles </p>

You're reading it wrong. The -games- aren't required to support 4xAA, the 
-hardware- is. It's great that you hate AA and all, but there are plenty of 
others that insist on it. By requiring the hardware to support to be '10.1 
compatible' they are merely pandering to the majority of gamers out there.<br>

<h4>Raytracing is overrated  (Score:2)</h4> by ardor (673957)  writes: <br>
 
Raytracing is really cool for global stuff like refractions, shadows, 
reflections, caustics. But in most cases, a rasterizer is better. Yes, 
raytracing is elegant, but a rasterizer will outperform it when rendering 
opaque surfaces. You should ask yourself why many CGI studios don't use (pure) 
raytracers anymore. A hybrid seems the way to go: rasterizing by default, but 
the ability to shoot rays in the pixel shader, which would be extremely cool 
for reflections and refractions.
