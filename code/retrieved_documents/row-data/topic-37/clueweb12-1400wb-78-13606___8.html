1. General Information 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
1.01: The OpenGL Game Development Mailing List &quot;This list is being 
provided as a service to the 3D game development community to help promote 
OpenGL as a viable and exciting way to program 3D entertainment titles. 
Discussion of game programming techniques and issues using OpenGL is the 
primary goal of this list! Since so much of the installed base consists of 
Intel PCs running Win32 platforms, the emphasis will probably be on that 
environment and C/C++. However, there are many other interesting platforms out 
there, and any discussion relating to OpenGL programming on those platforms is 
welcome! For instance, OpenGL programming in Java may well become a hot topic 
soon. Another thing to keep an eye on is OpenGL support in Apple's forthcoming 
Rhapsody OS. While the emphasis of this list is on game programming, general 
OpenGL programming information and examples are welcome as well. This is 
intended as a resource for all levels of OpenGL programmers, from beginner to 
expert. Other topics that are appropriate to the list include OpenGL device and 
driver quality, OpenGL benchmarking, and other real-world issues involved in 
doing OpenGL development. General topics relating to programming 3D games are 
also welcome. There are a few things that aren't desired on the list. The 
ongoing religious war between OpenGL and Direct3D is best left somewhere else 
(rec.games.programmer is a likely candidate ;-). Actively promoting other APIs 
besides OpenGL on this list is discouraged. General programming questions (i.e. 
&quot;which is better a pointer or an array?&quot;) are also best taken 
elsewhere. Some of these topics will inevitably creep onto the list, but let's 
try to keep the discussion civil and technical.&quot; - OpenGL Game Development

---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
1.02: Are the postings to the mailing list archived? An archive of this mailing 
list can be found at: http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/opengl-gamedev-l/ But 
it appears to have gone out of date. There are also archives available through 
the mail server itself (check the help for the mail server for details). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
1.03: The purpose of this FAQ? The main purpose of this FAQ is to either answer 
the most common questions posted to the mailing list or to point readers in the 
right direction. Questions on topics such as collision detection are too large 
to answer here. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
1.04: How can I get this FAQ? The home for this FAQ is located at: 
http://www.3dgamedev.com/resources/openglfaq.txt 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
1.05: Where can I find useful info on graphics algorithms? The best source for 
general graphics algorithm information is the comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ, 
posted bimonthly on the newsgroup of that name. This FAQ introduces many useful 
techniques as well as listing the most important books and links that no one 
should be without. This FAQ is also available from: 
http://www.exaflop.org/docs/cgafaq 
ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/faqs/graphics/algorithms-faq There is also a mailing 
list for algorithms. Info can be found at: 
http://www.3dgamedev.com/lists/algo_list.htm 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
1.06: Where can I get examples for OpenGL? The vast majority of example code 
for OpenGL on the net can be found through the Developers and Coding Examples 
sections on: http://www.opengl.org 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 
2. OpenGL Implementations 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.01: Microsoft OpenGL Microsoft provide OpenGL drivers as standard with 
Windows NT4.0 and Windows 95 Release 2, and will continue to do so with Windows 
98 and future Windows releases. An upgrade can be found on the Microsoft 
website for owners of Windows 95 Release 1. I am not aware of the distribution 
rules for their OpenGL libraries. Unlike the SGI libraries, the Microsoft ones 
will directly make use of any available hardware. Software rendering with the 
MS libraries is very slow compared to custom software rendering engines. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.02: SGI OpenGL for Windows Quoting from the SGI OpenGL for Windows SDK: 
&quot;Silicon Graphics' OpenGL library for Windows is a high-performance, fully 
compliant implementation that runs on Intel PCs. It allows a PC with no 
dedicated 3D graphics hardware to execute OpenGL applications at exceptional 
levels of performance and complements accelerated OpenGL products available 
from numerous 3D graphics hardware vendors. This version of Silicon Graphics' 
OpenGL library for Windows relies on Microsoft's OpenGL library for hardware 
acceleration. If an OpenGL driver is available on the system then the library 
will automatically call Microsoft's library so that the driver will be invoked 
during rendering. The next version of Silicon Graphics' library will be able to 
load OpenGL drivers directly.&quot; SGI libraries are called opengl.dll and 
glu.dll while the Microsoft libraries are called opengl32.dll and glu32.dll. 
Due to the agreement made between Microsoft and Silicon Graphics in Early 1998, 
this product is no longer being developed as such and is no longer officially 
available. However, the software rendering is far in advance of the Microsoft 
implementation (for political reasons) and some IHVs are basing their OpenGL 
libraries around this version, 3dfx for example. There are a few unsupported 
functions, but overall this is the choice for OpenGL development on 
unaccelerated machines. In the future, a joint venture between Microsoft and 
SGI will probably provide a successor to both Direct3D and OpenGL, called 
Fahrenheit. For further information please see the SDK. You can find a copy at: 
http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/ IMPORTANT NOTE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ First time users 
often have the same problem with the SGI implementation, please read the 
following if you cannot get your version to link correctly: Quoting from the 
SGI OpenGL for Windows SDK FAQ Section 4: &quot;To use SGI's OpenGL for Windows 
you must link with OPENGL.LIB and GLU.LIB instead of OPENGL32.LIB and GLU32.LIB 
respectively. Also make sure that OPENGL.LIB and GLU.LIB precede GDI32.lib in 
the library list. Since SGI's OpenGL for Windows library overloads the 
ChoosePixelFormat() function in GDI you need to make sure that you link the 
libraries in the right order so you don't pick up the wrong version of 
ChoosePixelFormat(). You should also set your include path so that SGI's header 
files have precedence over Microsoft's. This is required if you wish to use any 
of the extensions provided in SGI's OpenGL library for Windows.&quot; 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.03: Vendor Specific OpenGL Ports and Miniports As well as the main Microsoft 
and SGI implementations hardware vendors may ship their own OpenGL ports based 
on either of the aforementioned drivers. Whilst a full port is meant to 
strictly adhere to the standards laid down by the OpenGL 1.1 specification it 
is often the case that bugs and minor incompatibilities remain. Vendors also 
often provide their own extensions; check their documentation for more 
information, use glGetString to verify their existence, and use the appropriate 
function to call the extension (via wglGetProcAddress under Windows). NB: You 
must have an existing GL context or your call to glGetString will not be valid, 
though your target window may to some extent be defined by the hardware 
available to the user. One way around this is to temporarily open a dummy 
window when your application starts up, then open a further window set up 
according to the hardware available. OpenGL Miniports are there to support 
games such as Quake, and they will usually only support a small subset of 
OpenGL commands. There are some notes on miniports made available by 
independent users on the internet, but generally hardware manufacturers seem to 
be reluctant to release many details. Since most IHVs expect to provide full 
OpenGL 1.1 compliance miniports are not expected to be so useful in the future. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.04: 3DFXGL Like most vendors, 3DFX is working on a full implementation of 
OpenGL 1.1. For more information see http://www.3dfx.com For release notes see 
the 3dfx website and newsgroups, the beta version still has a few features 
missing. 2nd Monitor Debugging ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ One nice thing about 3dfx 
cards is that you can plug a 2nd VGA monitor into the output of the 3dfx card 
while keeping your main monitor attached to your primary video card. This 
allows you near full use of Windows functions for debugging, though there can 
be problems with the 3dfx not knowing it's screen/window is visible (another 
dreaded black screen problem). Usually bringing your 3dfx window into the 
foreground will solve the problem, but if anyone has good solutions for many of 
SGI's example programs perhaps they could send them in. Rendering into a window 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Voodoo series from 3Dfx cannot render into a GDI 
window by itself, however you can use WinGlide 
(http://www.nullsoft.com/winglide.html) to automatically copy the 3Dfx 
framebuffer to your 2D framebuffer so it will render to a window. This is 
slower than full-screen rendering, but essential when trying to debug on a 
single monitor setup. Removing the 3DFX Logo ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If you 
don't wish the 3dfx logo to be shown on user's machines, then according to Sam 
McGrath the following method is best: In runapp.bat: set T = 
%FX_GLIDE_NO_SPLASH% set FX_GLIDE_NO_SPLASH=1 runapp.exe set FX_GLIDE_NO_SPLASH 
= %T% The user's previous settings are therefore kept in place. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.05: What is MESA? Quoting the Author of Mesa (Brian Paul) from his Mesa 
homepage (http://www.mesa3d.org): &quot;Mesa is a 3-D graphics library which 
uses the OpenGL API (Application Programming Interface). Mesa cannot be called 
an implementation of OpenGL since I did not obtain an OpenGL license from SGI. 
Furthermore, Mesa cannot claim OpenGL conformance since the conformance tests 
are only available to OpenGL licensees. Despite these technical/legal terms, 
you may find Mesa to be a valid alternative to OpenGL.&quot; &quot;Most 
applications written for OpenGL can be recompiled for Mesa without making any 
source code changes.&quot; Mesa is issued with full source code under GPL and 
runs on a huge range of operating systems: UNIX/X11, Linux, Amiga, Apple 
Macintosh, BeOS, NeXT, OS/2, MS-DOS, VMS, and Windows 95/NT Mesa is also 
hardware accelerated on 3Dfx Voodoo and Voodoo RUSH (at time of writing) - 
further hardware support is expected. Other Mesa questions are answered in the 
Mesa FAQ at: http://www.mesa3d.org/Mesa/MesaFAQ.html Mesa can be obtained from: 
http://www.mesa3d.org There is a Mesa Mailing List, to subscribe, send email to 
majordomo@iqm.unicamp.br with this as the body of the message: subscribe mesa 
your-email-address 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.06: What is GLUT? Quoting the Author of GLUT (Mark Kilgard) from his GLUT 
homepage (http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/spec3/spec3.html): &quot;The OpenGL 
Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a programming interface with ANSI C and FORTRAN 
bindings for writing window system independent OpenGL programs. The toolkit 
supports the following functionality: Multiple windows for OpenGL rendering. 
Callback driven event processing. Sophisticated input devices. An 'idle' 
routine and timers. A simple, cascading pop-up menu facility. Utility routines 
to generate various solid and wire frame objects. Support for bitmap and stroke 
fonts. Miscellaneous window management functions, including managing 
overlays.&quot; GLUT is Copyright material and not in the public domain, but it 
is freely distributable without licensing fees and comes with complete source 
code. It is available for Windows 95, Windows NT, UNIX/X, Linux, OS/2 and 
Macintosh. Other GLUT questions are answered in the GLUT FAQ which is 
distributed with the GLUT library. GLUT can be obtained from: 
http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/glut3.html There is a GLUT Mailing List, 
to subscribe, send email to Majordomo@perp.com with a body saying 
&quot;subscribe glut&quot;. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.07: What is GameGLUT? GameGLUT is a utility toolkit being written with games 
in mind. Mark Kilgard introduced the possibility in late 1997/early 1998. 
GameGLUT is considered part of GLUT 3.7 and GLUT 3.7 is still in Beta. Since 
Mark started working at NVIDIA development of GLUT has been greatly reduced. 
Hopefully it will be finished soon. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
2.08: What is Fahrenheit? Fahrenheit is being designed by Microsoft and SGI to 
replace OpenGL and Direct3D on the Windows platform. It has not been released 
yet, and no technical information is available at this time. Ron Fosner seems 
to know quite a bit about it and might be able to answer any specific questions 
you may have. His web page is www.directx.com. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 
3. Programming Environments and OpenGL 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
3.01: Visual C++ Linking any of the libraries with Microsoft Visual C++ is as 
easy as changing the linked libraries. Before linking with the SGI OpenGL for 
Windows libraries please see the IMPORTANT NOTE in the SGI OpenGL for Windows 
section. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Subject 3.02: Borland C++ A comp.graphics.api.opengl posting by John 
Biddiscombe, j.biddiscombe@rl.ac.uk, includes the following tips: TIP : 
C++Builder uses a whole load of lib's in the CBuilder/lib directory, these 
libs, in particular import32.lib already contain the opengl32.lib and glu32.lib 
inside them. This means that you don't actually need to link to the libs using 
C++ Builder. If you want to (say) switch from Microsoft OpenGL to SGI OpenGL, 
then you need to use TLIB.exe to remove the DLL's from import32.lib, some notes 
are included in the files in the above directory. TIP2 : Use implib.exe to 
generate a lib from a DLL, frequently people distribute code with lib's in MSVC 
format so Borland users get stuck. Borland C++ links ok to OpenGL, but there 
are a couple of problems users should be aware of. * The Microsoft 
implementation can cause undefined exceptions when run under the BCB Pro 
debugger. * You need to mask floating point exceptions by including the 
following line in your initialization routines: _control87(MCW_EM, MCW_EM); 
MCD_EM should be defined in float.h Failing to do this results in spurious 
floating point exceptions, when using lighting or normalization in particular. 
A couple of examples are on: http://rcru1.te.rl.ac.uk/~jab/opengl/ Before 
linking with the SGI OpenGL for Windows libraries please see the IMPORTANT NOTE 
in the SGI OpenGL for Windows section. Alan Garny has some BCB OpenGL 
components available: http://pc-heartbreak.physiol.ox.ac.uk/ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
3.03: Delphi TBD 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
3.04: Visual Basic Patrice Scribes DirectX/OpenGL for VB site should be able to 
answer most questions: http://www.chez.com/scribe/ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
3.05: Java Quoting from the press release from Arcane Technologies Ltd: 
&quot;Magician allows developers to write portable, high-performance OpenGL 
applications using the Java programming language. To effect the 
high-performance rendering, Magician interfaces directly with existing OpenGL 
installations in the form of native code. In-core support for thread-safeness 
has also been implemented enabling developers to take full advantage of Java's 
powerful multi-threading. Additional developer features include in-built 
interactive tracing and profiling of OpenGL calls. Magician is currently 
shipping for Windows 95/NT, Linux and Irix operating systems with ports to 
Solaris, MacOS and OS/2 in the pipeline. Netscape Communicator, Internet 
Explorer, Symantec Cafe and the Sun JRE/JDK are currently supported for both 
application and applet usage on suitable platforms.&quot; See 
http://www.arcana.co.uk/products/magician There is also an OpenGL-Java FAQ at: 
http://www.arcana.co.uk/products/magician/docs/java-opengl-faq.html 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 
4. OpenGL as a rasterization only API 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.01: Why use OpenGL as a rasterization-only API? Because your app does its own 
transform, and supplies screen-space coordinates to the OpenGL. There are lots 
of reasons why an app might do this. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.02: Is there a performance hit for doing this? It depends on where the best 
place for doing the transform is. If (for example) there is fast transform 
hardware, then it would probably be a good idea to use it. If the OpenGL 
transform code is more efficient than the code in your app, then a similar 
argument applies. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.03: How do I set up OpenGL matrix stack for rasterization-only? Something 
like: glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); glLoadIdentity(); 
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glLoadIdentity(); glViewport(0, 0, width, height); 
/* viewport size in pixels */ will mean that the 3D point (0,0,0) is in the 
center of the viewport, and that (1,1,0) is the top-right corner of the 
viewport. To get a 1:1 pixel mapping, with (0,0,0) in the top-left of the 
viewport and (width,height,0) in the bottom-right, do this: 
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); glLoadIdentity(); glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); 
glLoadIdentity(); glScalef(2.0f / (float)width, -2.0f / (float)height, 1.0f); 
glTranslatef(-((float)width / 2.0f), -((float)height / 2.0f), 0.0f); 
glViewport(0, 0, width, height); /* viewport size in pixels */ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.04: What about clipping? Most OpenGL implementations, including SGI's for 
Windows, have extremely efficient clip-check code. The cost varies between 
negligible and zero. Some hardware can rasterize primitives that go outside the 
viewport for free, so it's not worthwhile to do clipping on the host. For this 
reason, you might as well leave clipping to OpenGL. In pseudocode, you change 
this: if (primitive isn't rejected) if (primitive is trivially accepted) draw 
it else clip it to this: if (primitive isn't rejected) draw it. OpenGL will 
clip it, or not, as the hardware requires. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.05: What about the perspective divide? You _can_ supply coordinates with (w 
== 1.0f), if you're prepared to do the perspective divide yourself. However, 
you might miss out on acceleration (for a similar reason to part 4 above), plus 
this approach makes supplying perspective-correct texture coordinates a 
headache. For these reasons it's probably best to use glVertex4f() and supply 
the transformed (i.e. non unity) w. If you do this, you can supply texture 
coordinates with glTexCoord2fv(). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.06: Fog The degree of fogging is calculated according to the eye-coordinate's 
z component. With a modelview matrix that passes Z straight through (such as 
the two above), you can set the near and far fog values according to the range 
of Z values that come out of your transform. You must use GL_LINEAR for this to 
work. For example, to make the &quot;rasonly&quot; example fogged, do the 
following: { GLfloat fog_color[4] = { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f }; /* white */ 
glEnable(GL_FOG); glHint(GL_FOG_HINT, GL_FASTEST); glFogi(GL_FOG_MODE, 
GL_LINEAR); glFogf(GL_FOG_START, 1.0f); glFogf(GL_FOG_END, 4.0f); 
glFogfv(GL_FOG_COLOR, fog_color); } 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
4.07: Is there some sample code to do this? The best sample is Michael Gold's 
&quot;rasonly.c&quot; - available at: 
http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/examples/index.html 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 
5. Rendering Problems 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
5.01: Why is my fog/lighting/texture not drawing correctly? This is most 
commonly caused by trying to place the camera position and orientation into the 
Projection Matrix. While at first glance this may seem like the right way to do 
things, it is not. The camera transformation should be combined with the model 
transformation in the ModelView matrix (hence the name ModelView). Lighting and 
fog (and to some extent textures and z-buffer information) are based on 
calculations that require information about the camera and the model rotations, 
but need to ignore any projection information (typically perspective). As such, 
these calculations are based solely on the ModelView matrix and ignore the 
Projection matrix. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
5.02: My objects appear to be &quot;fighting&quot; in the z-buffer. Most 
consumer cards have a relatively low precision z-buffer (16 bit) so you need to 
be careful when setting up your projection so you don't make the Z range too 
large. In general it is best to push the near Z as far out as possible, and 
bring in the far Z as close as possible. Changes in the near Z will have much 
larger effects than changes in the far Z. This will fix most problems. If you 
have a large Z range to deal with you may be able to use a trick to get around 
the fighting. If you can break up the scene into at least two different groups 
of objects where one group is &quot;close&quot; and the other group is 
&quot;distant&quot; and if those two groups do not intersect each other, you 
can do the following: 1. Clear the frame/depth buffers. 2. Render the distant 
objects. 3. Clear the depth buffer. 4. Render the close objects. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
5.03: Why doesn't my texture appear? Provided you can see the geometry with 
textures disabled: 1) GL_TEXTURE_2D isn't enabled 2) Texture Coordinates are 
incorrect 3) glBindTexture is failing 4) Alpha is incorrect 5) You are using an 
unsupported blend mode. For #5, there are a few cards out there with limited 
blending capability. The two most noteworthy are the Permedia2 and the Riva128. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
5.04: After calling glRotate() a few times I end up rotating around the wrong 
axis. Why? This problem is commonly referred to as Gimble Lock. It is a problem 
inherent in using 3 angles to describe an orientation and is mentioned in just 
about every 3D graphics book in existence. Typical solutions are to use a 
different representation for orientation. The common ones are; Matrix, 
Axis/Angle, and Quaternions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
5.05: Why doesn't rendering to multiple windows under Win32 (or MFC) work. You 
need to make sure CS_OWNDC is part of the window class. For MFC it is often 
temping to add CS_OWNDC to the cs.style parameter, but that is _not_ the 
correct way to do it. The following link shows an example of doing it 
correctly: http://www.codeguru.com/doc_view/custom_window_class.shtml 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 
6. Hardware Acceleration

6.01: How do I determine if I'm getting hardware acceleration under Windows 
NT/95/98? After you fill out the PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR, do the following: int 
pixelFormat = ChoosePixelFormat (hDC, &amp;pfd); PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR pfd_new; 
DescribePixelFormat (hDC, pixelFormat, sizeof(PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR), 
&amp;pfd_new); int generic_format = pfd_new.dwFlags &amp; PFD_GENERIC_FORMAT; 
int generic_accelerated = pfd_new.dwFlags &amp; PFD_GENERIC_ACCELERATED; if 
(generic_format &amp;&amp; ! generic_accelerated) { // software } else if 
(generic_format &amp;&amp; generic_accelerated) { // hardware - MCD } else if 
(! generic_format &amp;&amp; ! generic_accelerated) { // hardware - ICD } 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
6.02: Why am I not getting hardware acceleration? Most likely you have 
requested a pixel format that is unsupported by your current driver or the 
requested format cannot fit in the video memory of your card. For instance, 
requesting a 1024x768 16 bit double-buffered rendering context with a 16 bit 
z-buffer will put you into software emulation mode on a 4 Meg Riva 128 (it 
would require about 4.7 Megs of video memory). You would also be put into 
software, or the creation of the context may fail if you request a 24 bit frame 
buffer on the same card.

7. Picking/Selection 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
7.01: How do I use OpenGL's Selection Buffer? The Red Book (see Section A.02) 
has good example of this. The source code to everything in the Red Book is 
available at: http://trant.sgi.com/opengl/examples/redbook/redbook.html 
Specifically the pickdepth.c example. This is the prefered method of picking, 
but may not be practical for all applications. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
7.02: What are some other methods for picking/selection? Other methods include: 
1. Casting a ray for the mouse point into the scene and checking colisions 
between the ray and the geometry in the scene. 2. Reading back the z-buffer 
under the cursor. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. Full 
Screen Rendering 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
8.01: How do I open a full screen window? In a Windows application where you 
already know the screen resolution you can simply use the following code 
snippet: hWnd = CreateWindow(szAppName, &quot;Some Name&quot;, WS_POPUP | 
WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT, NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL); If you 
don't know the screen resolution you can use the following code to get it from 
the OS and then call the above code to create a full screen window: HEIGHT = 
GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN); WIDTH = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN); 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
8.02: How do I change resolution under Windows NT/95/98? Many people are 
tempted to use DirectDraw to switch resolutions under Windows, but this can 
cause problems with a few of the OpenGL drivers. The best way to change 
resolution under Windows is to use ChangeDisplaySettings(). Old drivers under 
95 may require a restart if you try to change the bit depth so it is best to 
have the bit depth set to the desired level before running the application.

Miscellaneous 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.01: What is the best way to draw text? There are many different ways to draw 
text under OpenGL but to get the best results you should place the font in a 
256x256 texture and use texture mapped quads with an orthographic projection to 
render the text. Sample Code: 
http://home.bc.rogers.wave.ca/borealis/opengl.html 
http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/tips/TexFont/TexFont.html 
http://home.worldnet.fr/~rehel/gltt/gltt.html 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.02: What is the best way to draw 2D overlays? The best way is to use an 
orthographic projection and render the overlays as texture mapped quads. If you 
want areas of the quads to be transparent the textures should be RGBA with the 
alpha used to create areas of transparency. This is very similar to the methods 
used in Subject 9.01. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.03: Should I use OpenGL's matrix routines for all my matrix math? In general 
the answer is &quot;no&quot;. If you use OpenGL to do the transforms for your 
collision detection or other things you will need to use the Feedback mechanism 
to get the transformed values back into your code. If you don't have hardware 
accelerated geometry then all you are doing is adding a layer of overhead to 
get the computed values. If you do have hardware accelerated transforms then 
your data needs to be sent over the bus to the card, transformed, then sent 
back. Reading data back from the card is typically very slow. As a result, even 
with hardware geometry it will probably be faster to do the transforms 
yourself.

9.06: What are BSP Trees? Check out the BSP FAQ at: 
http://reality.sgi.com/bspfaq/ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.07: What are light maps and how do I use them in OpenGL? Light maps are a set 
of textures that are blended with the normal textures in the scene to produce 
lighting effects. This technique is more generally known as multi-pass 
rendering, or multi-texture rendering. Multi-pass effects take two or more 
passes over pixels in the frame buffer. This typically means the geometry needs 
to be transformed multiple times and sent to the hardware card for each pass. 
Multi-pass can be done with standard blending and rendering techniques. 
Multi-texture produces the same or similar effects as multi-pass, but in a 
single pass. Usually this means that two textures are combined with some form 
of blending to produce a single output pixel. With multi-texturing the geometry 
only needs to be sent to the hardware once. Multi-texturing requires an 
extension to OpenGL. At one point two extensions were available and different 
drivers used different extensions (SGIS_multitexture and EXT_multitexture). Now 
all drivers either support, or will soon support the standardized extension 
(ARB_multitexture). An example using ARB_multitexture can be found at: 
http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/examples/index.html 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.08: How do I load a .BMP file into a texture map? Microsoft has some pretty 
detailed instructions on how to load a DIB (a BMP file in memory) into an 
OpenGL texture in their MSDN distribution. Do a search for &quot;OpenGL 
BMP&quot; and you'll turn up some good info. You can also get some example 
source here: http://home.bc.rogers.wave.ca/borealis/opengl.html 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.09: Can I mix OpenGL and DirectX? DirectX describes a suite of API's by 
Microsoft that includes DirectDraw, Direct3D, DirectInput, DirectPlay, 
DirectSound, etc. You cannot mix DirectDraw or Direct3D with OpenGL, but all of 
the others can be used without a problem. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.10: How do I access the frame/depth/texture memory directly? You don't. 
OpenGL does not provide any interface for accessing this memory directly. You 
can get access to the contents of those buffers by using glReadPixels() but it 
is slow. There has been much debate over whether this is a good thing or a bad 
thing, but the reasons are basically irrelevant. You can't get direct access 
through OpenGL. Access to these buffers belongs in the windowing system 
(through DirectDraw or something similar) and not in OpenGL. Currently Windows 
does not provide any means to access this information. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.11: How do I use OpenGL for Collision Detection? You don't. OpenGL is a used 
to draw images on the screen, not to do general geometry manipulation. For 
information on collision detection see Section A.03. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.12: What is the best card for running OpenGL under Windows NT/95/98? This 
question comes up fairly often and the only answer is, &quot;It depends on what 
you're doing&quot;. Every few months a new card comes along that looks real 
cool. Every few months new drivers are released that could potentially turn a 
performance pig into a greyhound. This question is best answered by a little 
research on the your part and a few trips around the web to some sites that 
specialize in benchmarking cards. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.13: How do you use extensions? Extensions can take the form of new API 
functions, or as enumerants to existing functions. The following URL has a 
header file with many common function prototypes and enumerants. Be sure to 
check the glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS) for the extension before using it. See the 
other examples at this URL for more details. 
http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/examples/index.html Extensions not found in 
this header file are detailed on: http://www.opengl.org 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.14: How do I draw a mouse cursor on a 3dfx Voodoo1/Voodoo2 card? How do I 
draw a custom mouse pointer using OpenGL? Since the Voodoo1/Voodoo2 is 3D only, 
you do not have access to the 2D GDI functions to allow Windows to draw your 
pointer. Or, you may want to use OpenGL for portability to other platforms. A 
mouse pointer is simply a 2D overlay, and can be drawn with a texture mapped 
quad (see Subject 9.01 and 9.02), or as flat shaded triangles as in the sample 
below. Sample code: 
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/7220/pointer.html 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject 
9.15: How did those guys at ID software make it so you could pick your OpenGL 
driver? They do not dynamically link to the opengl32.dll, they use the Windows 
functions LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress to manually load the appropriate DLL 
and get the address of each function. Sample Code:
