 With the fast increasing complexity of 
integrated circuits, logic simulation based design verification has become the 
bottleneck of today&#146;s design flows of integrated circuits (ICs). This 
session reviews our recent work on using GPU to accelerate logic simulation at 
both register-transfer level (RTL) and gate level. Our simulation framework is 
based on a distributed data structure to manage simulation events. A dynamic 
GPU memory allocator is also introduced to efficiently manage GPU memory 
resources. The operation of GPU during simulation is orchestrated by an 
asynchronous parallel simulation protocol for sufficient parallelism. In 
addition, RTL simulation is performed in a compiled-code scheme by translating 
the input hardware description language (e.g., Verilog) into equivalent CUDA 
code. Experimental results show that the GPU simulators significantly 
outperform their CPU counterparts. This work proves the potential of modern 
GPUs to revolutionize the landscape of IC verification.&nbsp; Back <br>

 To understand the 
nature of the strong interaction in the subatomic regime is a grand challenge 
in science. Now we know that the fundamental theory for the strong interaction 
is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). However, starting from the action of QCD, it 
is very computationally demanding to extract physical observables in QCD, which 
always requires the state-of-the-art supercomputers. In this talk, I outline 
the salient features of QCD which are relevant to HPC, and explain how GPU can 
serve as a vital device for large-scale QCD simulations. Moreover, I present a 
new strategy to compute QCD nonperturbatively from the first principles, which 
can be improved systematically, and will eventaully lead to high precision 
predictions from the first principles of QCD.&nbsp; Back <br>

 Many 
applications of GPGPU marshal hundreds of GPUs in large computer clusters, 
enabling large simulations where the ratio of calculation to actual data is 
large. In the laboratory, however, many experimental applications have large 
quantities of data; so large, in fact, that moving the data to a remote cluster 
may take longer than analyzing it once it arrives. The ability to bring 
supercomputing to the data, in form of NVIDIA GPUs, however, allows 
high-throughput analysis where results can be obtained fast enough to guide 
subsequent experiments. This interactive feedback loop can improve the quality 
of the science itself. I discuss a number of applications where we have applied 
GPGPU techiques with CUDA to analyzing images and data in the laboratory, 
including swimming bacteria, diffusing colloids, and optical tomography, and 
phase-separating liquid-gas colloidal mixtures onboard the International Space 
Station. &nbsp; Back <br>

 Pushed by the pace of 
innovation in the GPU architecture and more generally the manycore technology, 
the processor landscape is moving fast. This fast evolution makes software 
development more complex. Furthermore, the impact of the programming style on 
future performance and portability of the application is difficult to forecast. 
The use of directives to annotate serial languages (e.g. C/C++/Fortran) looks 
very promising. They abstract the programming of low-level parallelism details 
while preserving code assets against the evolution of processor architectures. 
In this presentation, we describe how to use the HMPP (Heterogeneous Manycore 
Parallel Programming) API, one of the directive-based approaches, to program 
heterogeneous compute nodes. In particular, we provide insights on how GPU / 
CPU can be exploited in a unified manner and how code tuning issues can be 
minimized. We extend the discussion to the use of libraries that is currently 
one of the key elements when addressing GPU and manycores. &nbsp; Back <br>

 Modern 
Internet routers must meet two conflicting objectives, high performance and 
good programmability, to satisfy the ever-increasing bandwidth requirements 
under fast changing network protocols. A few recent works prove that GPUs have 
great potential to serve as the packet processing engine for software routers. 
However, current GPU's batched execution model cannot guarantee 
quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. In this work, we show how to convert a 
GPU into an effective packet processor through minimal changes in both hardware 
architecture and scheduling mechanism. Experimental results proved that the new 
GPU architecture could meet stringent QoS requirements, but maintain a high 
processing throughput.&nbsp; Back <br>

 Discover and leverage parallelism inherent in 
pre-existing codes. Often times, parallelism is hidden in seemingly serial 
programs. This is due obfuscation via indexing or looping wherein the 
parallelism is seemingly non-existent. Several real-world examples of seemingly 
serial code demonstrate simple, yet surprisingly effective rules for detecting 
potential parallelism. For each example, learn how to express the code at a 
higher, more concise level in M by vectorizing computations. We give several 
canned techniques of vectorization for many common, and sometimes very 
difficult, use cases. Learn how such vectorization concisely brings the 
parallelism of code to the forefront and transforms programs that might have 
been originally difficult to run on a SIMT device very suitable for execution 
on the GPU. GPU speedups will be shown utilizing Jacket. &nbsp; Back <br>

Logic simulation is a critical component of the digital design tool flow. It is 
used from high-level descriptions down to gate-level to validate several 
aspects of the design, particularly functional correctness. Despite development 
houses investing vast resources in the simulation task it is still far from 
achieving the performance demands of validating complex modern designs at 
gate-level. We developed a GP-GPU accelerated gate-level simulator using NVIDIA 
CUDA. We leverage novel algorithms for circuit netlist partitioning and found 
that our experimental prototype could handle large, industrial scale designs 
comprised of millions of gates while delivering 13x speedup on average over a 
typical commercial simulator. &nbsp; Back <br>

 High-end graphics memory has been an essential ingredient in designing PC 
cards for many years, just as mobile DRAM has been a part of virtually all 
mobile devices since they were first developed. In the face of increasing 
upward pressures on power consumption, Green GDDR5 and Low Power mobile DDR2 
(or LPDDR2) provide outstanding performance at exceptionally low power levels, 
for a greater return on investment in designing desktop and mobile devices, 
respectively. This Samsung presentation will provide an overview of Green 
GDDR5's and Green LPDDR2's power savings compared to other much less energy 
efficient alternatives. The presenter also will take a close look at how GDDR5 
and LPDDR2 work to improve performance and extend battery life, while helping

 While computing with the GPU may seem like a 
new technology, the foundations upon what is available today have a legacy 
which date back to the original parallel supercomputers. The research community 
first identified the GPU as a computing platform and shown the promise to solve 
many of the world's compute intensive problems, many orders of magnitude faster 
the conventional CPUs. Once the opportunity became obvious, the challenge was 
how to best evolve a general purpose programming model to preserve the GPU's 
architectural advantage. In this talk, I will provide both a perspective on how 
GPU computing evolved from early published results of using GPU as a computing 
platform, to the early programming models and tools, what the state of the art 
is today, and extrapolate where GPU computing is going. &nbsp; Back <br>

 OptiX is the latest 
and most flexible API for interactive ray tracing, taking full advantage of the 
power and generality of the CUDA architecture. This new technology is valuable 
for anyone wanting to build a high-performance, ray tracing renderer 
(interactive or off-line), accelerate an existing ray tracing renderer, add 
raytrace capabilities to raster renderers, or even perform generic ray tracing 
functions for computation. By replacing fixed components of a traditional ray 
tracer with user-specified programs, OptiX is able to implement a rich array of 
rendering and non-rendering algorithms while still maintaining high 
performance. Examine these programmable components, and the flexibility they 
provide, through a guided tour of this exciting new engine.&nbsp; Back <br>

 State-of-the-art graphics processing 
units (GPUs) contain hundreds of processing units and are able to perform 
trillions of floating point arithmetic operations per second. The newly 
available computational power brought by GPUs is enabling a new generation of 
scientific and engineering applications to perform calculations on 
&quot;personal supercomputers&quot; that previously required HPC clusters or 
that were otherwise impractical in everyday use. This talk will present recent 
successes in multi-GPU acceleration in VMD, a molecular dynamics visualization 
and analysis application in which GPU computing techniques have provided 
speedups ranging from 10 to over 100 times faster than commodity CPU cores. The 
talk will describe key challenges and algorithmic strategies involved in 
achieving high computational performance on GPUs, discuss methods for 
effectively using multiple GPUs in low-latency calculations that drive 
interactive visualizations, and will also include some examples of how these 
performance increases ultimately enable better science. &nbsp; Back <br>

 Processors and computing systems are becoming very 
heterogenous. Imagine writing a program that runs on a cluster, a shared-memory 
multi-core processor, and a many-core GPU. In each case the application needs 
to be completely rewritten. The cluster will use MPI, the shared-memory system 
threads and locks, and GPU a data-parallel programming model like CUDA. The 
cost of maintaining three different versions of a program is often prohibitive, 
and limits the adoption of GPUs in many applications. My thesis is that the 
only way to program such diverse set of systems is to raise the level of 
abstraction and build domain-specific programming models that are able to 
automatically map applications to different types of platforms. Our goal is to 
make it much easier to adopt innovative new platforms. In this talk, I will 
present the case for domain-specific programming models, and outline several 
projects that we are doing at Stanford as part of the Pervasive Parallelism 
Laboratory. &nbsp; Back <br>

 GDDR5 is the most 
up-to-date graphics memory technology today, offering an impressive bandwidth 
of between 4 and 7Gbps. However, demand continues for the development of finer 
and finer graphics to be used in games as well as professional design 
applications. So, the memory Industry is considering how it is going to move 
beyond GDDR5 levels in a couple of years to reach bandwidths of more than 
10Gbps. Considerable obstacles await. Samsung research indicates that it will 
be difficult to overcome a few major barriers to attaining and exceeding data 
transfer speeds in excess of 10Gbps with the single-ended technology that is 
used today. The industry will need to uncover a cost-efficient way to move 
beyond single-ended memory chip designs. Memory vendors will have to closely 
examine a variety of factors including differential technology, and wide I/O 
schemes. This presentation will review GDDR5 technology and present various 
ideas on how best to exceed the bellwether threshold of 10Gbps. &nbsp; Back <br>

 Writing reliable GPU 
codes that achieve peak performance in the face of changing requirements and 
hardware platforms can be a challenging task. In this talk, I will introduce 
the open-source PyCUDA toolkit, which assists in this task in a number of ways: 
Convenient, high-level interface PyCUDA binds all functionality in Nvidia CUDA 
to a convenient interface in the high-level scripting language Python. Resource 
management and error checking are automatic. Code Templates PyCUDA comes with 
tuned and debugged code for many common operations, such as vector math and 
reductions, which saves debugging and coding time. Metaprogramming PyCUDA 
allows GPU code to be generated at run-time code, which makes many advanced 
programming techniques easy-such as empirical optimization, constant folding, 
and run-time specialization. Scalability PyCUDA covers &quot;small-scale&quot; 
and &quot;large-scale&quot; uses alike: It allows quick prototyping and 
experimentation, but it also integrates easily into large-scale computational 
software. Having introduced the toolkit, I will show how PyCUDA has supported a 
number of applications in computational science: First, we have successfully 
used PyCUDA in a high-performance discontinuous Galerkin finite element 
(DG-FEM) solver. The term DG-FEM describes a family of high-order accurate 
numerical methods for systems of partial differential equations that model 
real-world processes such as electromagnetic scattering or fluid flow. We found 
that these methods' algorithmic structure makes them very suitable for 
execution on a GPU, often achieving speedup factors on the order of 50 when 
compared to a single CPU core. PyCUDA and GPU metaprogramming were crucial in 
achieving this level of performance. As an added benefit, the resulting solver 
turned out to be very versatile with respect to equation types, domain 
dimensionality, and discretization parameters. Second, I will discuss a recent 
effort seeking to automate the writing of high-performance GPU code for a large 
class of computational kernels that includes many of those needed for the 
numerical discretization of PDEs. Again, code generation and empirical 
optimization as provided by PyCUDA provide the basis for the approach that may 
make GPU performance possible even in situations where manual development is 
not economical.&nbsp; Back <br>

 Rendering has been the classic challenge of 3D 
graphics. But today, with complex scenes having millions of polygons and 
wanting to add physical effects --just moving and deforming those polygons 
presents a growing challenge especially when trying to achieve real time 
performance. In some dynamic scenes, tens of thousands of vertexes need to have 
their new position recalculated for each frame and in some cases (like physical 
simulation) every sub frame. For this reason, using the GPU to perform these 
calculations is very tempting. But one of the problems that arise from moving 
these calculations to the GPU is, triangular mesh topologies don''t have a 
predefined vertex locality, it depends on the arbitrary indexing mechanism used 
when the topology was created. And even in optimal circumstances, there are 
always vertexes which destroy the locality. At OptiTex, we have been using CUDA 
since the initial 0.8 Beta. OptiTex specialty is cloth. Using CUDA we are on 
the way to deliver an implicit cloth engine, which will work in real time for 
cloth meshes up to 10,000 polygons. In our process we have ported (and are 
still working) all of our geometry calculations to the GPU. These include 
normals, smooth skin, collision detection, finite elements and more. During the 
development of these parts, different problems occurred relating to vertex 
index locality. These were solved using a variety of methods and approaches.

 Advances in a variety of fields ranging from cellular phone design to MRI coil 
design necessitate the use of high accuracy electromagnetic computational 
methods such as Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) to analyze complex new 
products. High fidelity techniques such as FDTD generally yield highly accurate 
results at the cost of increased computation time. Using the processing power 
of NVIDIA's CUDA architecture allows this time to be reduced by over two orders 
of magnitude. This session presents an implementation of the FDTD method using 
NVIDIA's CUDA technology. The core algorithm is presented in C code and 
translated to a CUDA kernel. Branching statements are eliminated in order to 
improve parallelism. Shared memory and an optimized looping method are employed 
to avoid memory communication bottlenecks. Timing comparisons against an 
optimized commercial FDTD code are given. &nbsp; Back <br>

 Quantum 
Chromodynamics (QCD) is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction, 
describing the interactions of the quarks and gluons making up hadrons (e.g., 
proton, neutron, and pion). Most importantly, it accounts for the nuclear 
energy inside an atom, as well as plays an important role in the evolution of 
the early universe. To solve QCD is a grand challenge among all sciences. Now 
the most promising approach to solve QCD nonperturbatively is to discretize the 
continuum space-time into a 4 dimensional lattice (i.e., lattice QCD), and to 
compute physical observables with Monte Carlo simulation. For lattice QCD with 
exact chiral symmetry, it often requires supercomputers (e.g., 10 racks of IBM 
BlueGene) to perform the simulations. The TWQCD Collaboration in Taiwan is the 
first lattice QCD group around the world to use a GPU cluster (with 120 GPUs) 
to perform large-scale unquenched simulations of lattice QCD with the optimal 
domain-wall fermions, attaining 14 Teraflops (sustained) at a price of 
$200,000. This has significant impacts to the lattice QCD, as well as the 
physics of the strong interaction. &nbsp; Back <br>

advertising dollars unless the contents, impact and meaning of that content is 
known. Milabra decodes that meaning and turns these visual liabilities into 
visible revenue. Milabra''s Image Intelligence platform and commercial 
decisioning framework is fast, accurate and easy to use. Our sophisticated 
neural network technology has the ability to add value to every image and 
visual element we see. Founded in 2008, the company was formed by a team of 
experienced entrepreneurs, industry veterans and scientists from the best 
visual recognition programs in the country. The company fuses neuroscience with 
proven advertising, psychology and grapic theory. &nbsp; Back <br>

 HPC Project, under the Wild Systems brand, provides application-in-a-box 
solutions for demanding users who require intensive computational power. The 
company brings to the market the cumulative experience of experts in 
simulation, parallel computing and computer architecture. The company is 
dedicated to package turnkey products, providing outstanding computing 
performance in a desktop form factor for interactive use of complex dataset. 
Wild Systems Solutions are supported by best-of-breed technologies representing 
more than 25 years of R&amp;D in the supercomputing field. This technology is 
based upon a formal analysis of source codes enabling correct automated 
transformations. These techniques are used to detect inherent parallelism in 
applications that could then be optimized to take advantage of the latest 
chipset architecture. Such a technology happens to be particularly handy when 
dealing with specialized architectures such as GPU. These circuits require a 
particular attention in the organization of data in memory and of communication 
between on-board memory and main memory. Hand-coding this type of structures 
could be very tedious and error-prone. Our compiler framework provides in this 
context the necessary alignment of data and the pipelining of their 
communication for a high-performance execution.&nbsp; Back <br>

 Based in Orange County, CA, Kerosene and a Match (KaaM) is a 
software developer building tools that leverage the massively parallel, low 
cost computing power of commodity graphics processors to build ultra-high 
performance cloud computing platforms. The company''s first product is a new 
multimedia discovery and indexing platform that combines GPU and cloud 
computing to give standard commercial search systems the ability to 
&quot;discover&quot; the content of &quot;unsearchable&quot; (aka, un-indexed 
and/or untagged by people) images, audio and video, and return the results just 
as it would text. Because upwards of 80% of all non-text content on the 
Internet is unsearchable, the KaaM technology offers organizations the ability 
to generate income from huge volumes of formerly unmonetized media. KaaM 
licenses its technology to enterprises, government agencies and other 
organizations with large scale networks housing enormous amounts of rich media. 
The company also plans to deliver a software as a service (SaaS) offering for 
smaller entities late in 2010. &nbsp; Back <br>
