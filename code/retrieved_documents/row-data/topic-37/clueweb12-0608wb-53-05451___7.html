<h2> Egoboo: The Cute Way to Dungeon Role Play</h2> by Howard Wen <br>
 
03/13/2003
<p>In the land of Bishopia, King Bishop has been kidnapped by evil forces. To 
rescue him, you must traverse dungeons in search of the &quot;Sporks of 
Power&quot;. (Yes, these objects do look like the spoon/fork hybrid utensil.) 
This game premise might sound, well, silly, but it's silly by design. The 
creators ofEgoboo--brothers Aaron and Ben Bishop--have aimed to make their game 
the most accessible and cutest open source dungeon RPG.</p> <br>

<p>Egoboo features real-time action and 3D graphics. As is standard in dungeon 
adventures, game play consists of combat against monsters, spell-casting, and 
exploring a variety of map levels. The world of Bishopia consists of seven 
environments. You choose to play as one of eight hero characters, including an 
elf, rogue, soldier, or wizard. While the game is nowhere near complete, 
Egoboo's current form still has plenty of dungeon romping and monster-bashing. 
The game runs under Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.</p> 
<p>Egoboo was originally developed by Aaron Bishop. Ben Bishop, his brother, a 
former computer science professor at the University of Georgia, currently 
maintains the game. Both brothers currently reside in Danville, Pennsylvania.
</p> 
<p>The motivation for the ongoing work of Egoboo has been the brothers' desire 
to make a modernRoguelike game. In terms of its design, the inspiration for its 
game play draws uponNetHack. The graphics exhibit a Japanime style; 
specifically, the artistic look of Nintendo's<em>Legend of Zelda</em> series is 
obvious.</p>

<h3>From the Classroom to Open Source</h3> 
<p>Egoboo development began in 1999. In its simpler form, it started as a 
Direct3D Windows game Aaron did as an assignment for one of his college 
classes. Ben eventually convinced his brother to release it as open source. 
They then rewrote Egoboo for cross-platform portability by usingSDL and OpenGL. 
They also credit other open source programmers specializing in graphics for 
contributing the help they needed to accomplish this specific task. (When Aaron 
started Egoboo, his graphics card only supported Direct3D.)</p>

<p>&quot;Converting Direct3D to OpenGL was like getting teeth pulled,&quot; 
describes Ben. He recalls this as the biggest challenge in Egoboo's 
development. &quot;If anyone reading this ever writes a graphic program, wrap 
the graphics API calls in macros!&quot;</p> 
<p>Ben points out that OpenGL itself was not the problem in this process: 
&quot;OpenGL has been a pleasure to work with. The original code from Direct3D 
was a complete mess. There are still some lingering problems from the 
conversion, though, such as our flaky support for particles. They don't rotate 
properly.&quot;</p> 
<p>Aside from the OpenGL and SDL APIs, the rest of the codebase is original 
and was written in C by the Bishop brothers. They did borrow the Quake II model 
format for game characters, however, to avoid the work of writing their own 
modeling program from scratch. An extra, obvious benefit is that this decision 
makes customizing Egoboo much easier: the mod community is full of people who 
are familiar with creating Quake II models.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are working with the Quake II model format to simplify the lives 
of character developers,&quot; says Ben. &quot;Users have been able to 
contribute new models, and I hope some of these start making it into the game 
soon.&quot;</p> 
<p>While the character models are done in Quake II format, Egoboo uses a 
separate tool, developed for Egoboo, calledCartman, for map generation. Other 
map-making tools for Egoboo are also available and in development, including
EgoMap, which adds random level generation to the game.</p> 
<p>As far as the game's AI, its scripting is specific to Egoboo. Ben, who 
wrote some of the AI, feels this is unfortunate because it has probably 
hindered further development by others who might want to help to improve it. It 
is possible for others to study the existing AI scripts and documentation, but 
he admits it is not easy to figure out. Some have suggested to the Egoboo 
developers that they useLua for scripting the AI functions, but there has been 
no significant progress on this idea. Ben says this may partly be because 
support for the Lua language in egoboo &quot;is not 'fully baked' as of now, 
from what I know.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Egoboo graphics engine itself is not limited to dungeon crawlers. Other 
kinds of games can be built upon it. In fact, Ben says his brother has already 
developed some of his own: &quot;Aaron always seemed to get distracted and 
[would] code up new games using the Egoboo engine. He had a simple real-time 
strategy test, as well as a bumper car game.&quot;</p> 
<p> <em>Figure 2 -- a peaceful outdoor scene, unless you're a sheep</em><br>

</p> 
<p>To those interested in modifying the Egoboo code to create an entirely 
different type of game, Bishop warns that the learning curve for the engine is 
pretty steep. He suggests that it might be best to start by contributing to the 
development of the original dungeon crawl, a more likely way to gain better 
technical insight into the engine's code.</p> 
<p> <em>Figure 3 -- a little lightning</em><br>
</p> 
<h3>A Much-Needed Fixing and Polishing</h3> 
<p>Before any new features can be added to Egoboo's game play, Ben says a 
couple of existing technical issues need to be addressed, particularly with its 
graphics. As mentioned above, particle graphics do not rotate in the OpenGL 
version of the game like they do in the Direct3D original. Another partial 
feature is transparency. Egoboo is also supposed to have a network play 
feature, but it's broken in its present state. Fixing the particle graphics is 
easy, says Ben, but the network issue will be tougher to resolve.</p> 
<p>The networking challenge is typical for this type of game. &quot;Being an 
action game, network code timing is a big concern. In something like a 
real-time strategy, you might not notice if your units take a half-second to 
start moving. On Egoboo, this is not the case,&quot; says Ben. &quot;Our main 
problem is that we haven't gotten around to porting the network code from the 
original DirectX. I think it would be a pretty straightforward job for a 
competent programmer with some spare time.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Egoboo project could also use contributions of character and object 
models for the game and definitely needs more level maps. While the game looks 
very good in its current form, it does not have a polished feel of a commercial 
game, which Ben admits and wants to see improved. He invites others to 
contribute to Egoboo's development; outside submissions of any sort will 
encourage the release of more official updates to the game:</p> 
<p>&quot;It takes some effort to put a new release out. So I'd like say what 
would get me to do a new release: A new level, significant bug fixes 
(networking, particles, etc.), and a good new [development] tool. If you want 
to get to work on the code, consider setting up your own CVS. The code in 
Version 2.22 is current.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the end, Ben is proudest not of the technical achievements that he, his 
brother, and various volunteers have made to Egoboo, but, rather, the game's 
very place within the overall open source gaming scene. &quot;Good open source 
games are few and far between,&quot; he says. &quot;So I think Egoboo is 
contributing by enlarging the pool of games.&quot;</p>

 I found out about egoboo the other day and dld it to try it 
out, it's awesome! Obviously it's still being developed(as a good opensource 
projects always should be!) I can't wait to see network gameplay! the website 
is lacking though, imho.<br>
 it needs a better forum, but it will get one once 
it develops a larger community </li> </ul>

 I 
haven't played it, as to be honest I never heard of it, but looking at the 
graphics, it looks pretty cool, think the first thing I'll do tonight is 
download it and give it a whirl...<br>
 There are a lot of opensource rpg out 
there, no matter how good them seem, they all generally feel clumky in terms of 
graphics quality, but this look pretty nice..<br>
<br>
 btw the images on the 
main page fails to display and yo get a forbidden when viewing them (Or it 
could be me!) </li>

 I've 
had it for a while, there's a Debian package for it, so it's easy to install. I 
had to play it for an hour or two before I finally got a hang of the controls. 
On my machine, the controls are a little jerky, though.<br>
<br>
 Egoboo is a 
really fun game and the graphics are awesome. I'm not a very good gamer, so for 
me, the game is REALLY HARD. It seems like I am seriously outnumbered. It would 
probably be easier if we could have a network game and make teams to fight 
against the bad guys.<br>
<br>
 Good work, Egoboo crew! Thanks for the awesome 
game. </li> </ul> </ul> <br>
