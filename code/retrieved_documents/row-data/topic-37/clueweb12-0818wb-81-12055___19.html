<h3>Android Hacking (Part 1 of probably many)</h3> 4&nbsp;Comments Published by
vladimir November 19th, 2009 in Firefox, Mozilla <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking to understand the Android OS better, so that I can 
answer some questions and create plans for getting Gecko/Firefox running on 
Android-based devices.&nbsp; One of the first questions I asked was, &ldquo;How 
do Android apps start?&rdquo;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re clearly separate processes 
while they&rsquo;re running, but it wasn&rsquo;t clear how they were 
launched.&nbsp; It turns out, there are a couple of pieces here.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m going to describe what I&rsquo;ve discovered here, in case it&rsquo;s 
useful for someone else; I haven&rsquo;t been able to find much of this 
information, largely because I don&rsquo;t think many people need to know any 
of this.</p> 
<p>At boot time, a special instance of the Java VM is launched, called the 
Zygote.&nbsp; This process loads a bunch of the core Java classes and performs 
initial processing of them, making it possible to avoid this step for each app 
launch.&nbsp; Once the initial work is done, the process listens to a socket 
and waits for requests.</p> 
<p>To launch an app using the Zygote process, a command-line tool called 
&ldquo;dvz&rdquo; can be used.&nbsp; It sends its arguments to the Zygote, 
which will fork and then start executing the main method in a given class.</p> 
<p>So, we have these steps, dealing with the Zygote process:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the zygote process is executed at system boot; it does initialization, and 
then runs a select() loop listening to requests</li> 
<li>the zygote process is sent a message, which includes the start args, which 
will include the class name for main launch</li> 
<li>the zygote process reads connection args in ZygoteConnection.runOnce</li> 
<li>the zygote process forks in ZygoteConnection.runOnce (
Zygote.forkAndSpecialize, native)</li> 
<li>ZygoteConnection.handleChildProc is called, which does some cleanup and 
eventually throws a MethodAndArgsCaller (viaZygoteInit.invokeStaticMain)</li> 
<li>&hellip; which takes us all the way back to ZygoteInit.main, which catches 
that trampoline exception, and calls run()</li> </ul> 
<p>But, that&rsquo;s not fully how a new Android Activity is started.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s a bit of a roundabout process.&nbsp; To launch a new Activity, the 
ActivityManagerService is notified with an activity start request, including 
things like the name/class/etc. of the activity.&nbsp; It puts that information 
in a list of activities to run.&nbsp; Then, a new process is started with the 
main from ActivityThread.&nbsp; This new process then contacts the 
ActivityManagerService and asks, essentially, &ldquo;what app am 
I?&rdquo;.&nbsp; The service then gives it the name of its activity class and 
other info, which is then loaded, and a message is enqeued on the main thread 
to instantiate the new activity and send it an onCreate() message.</p> 
<p>This is interesting because it means that apps are not launched directly, 
but instead somewhat indirectly through specializing a generic 
&ldquo;Activity&rdquo; process for a specific activity.&nbsp; A side effect of 
this is that I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to actually register an app with the 
ActivityManagerService if it wasn&rsquo;t launched by it.&nbsp; So, to be a 
full Android app, you have to go through this normal startup process.</p> 
<h2>JNI Bridging</h2> 
<p>One of the difficulties in porting Gecko to Android is that the Android 
platform is built around Java, whereas Gecko is very much all native 
C/C++.&nbsp; However, there is a fairly good native bridge layer, JNI, which is 
fairly heavily optimized by Dalvik.&nbsp; So, the simplest way to connect these 
two is to write a shell app in Java, which bridges events, messages, paint 
requests, etc. to the native code for handling.</p> 
<p>As a proof of concept of this, I wrote a simple test app.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
fairly straightforward, with a few wrinkles.&nbsp; Most of this stuff can be 
done with the stock Android SDK and NDK &mdash; except painting.&nbsp; The only 
API that the NDK exposes for graphics is OpenGL ES.&nbsp; This is fine, but in 
some cases you may want to access Skia directly from native code.&nbsp; This is 
possible, but requires version-specific code to accomplish.&nbsp; You can ship 
multiple versions of your JNI glue layer, optimized for each Android version 
(or even platform), and load the right one during your app startup on the Java 
side.</p> 
<p>This is, of course, not very portable, robust, or guaranteed to continue to 
work by Google, but it&rsquo;s possible.&nbsp; There are some very rough hacks 
in the test app, but for the most part it demonstrates that this approach can 
work fine.</p> 
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll probably blog about porting issues for large native 
apps, including library compatibility, Bionic, and integrating into a 
non-ant-based build system.</p> <br>

<h3>CanvasArrayBuffer and Canvas*Array</h3> 6&nbsp;Comments Published by 
vladimir November 6th, 2009 in Canvas 3D, Firefox, Mozilla <br>

<p>WebGL introduces two interesting concepts that I think have application 
outside of WebGL, theCanvasArrayBuffer and CanvasArray WebGLArrayBuffer and 
WebGLArray. This is all subject to change, of course, though this is what the 
current Gecko (and others&rsquo;) implementation looks like. In particular, the 
Canvas prefix in the names might change soon.</p> 
<p><strong>Edit 12/2: these types have changed names; they now have a WebGL 
prefix instead of a Canvas prefix.</strong></p> 
<p>It became clear that pure JS arrays are not a useful way of shoveling 
around lots of 3D data; their very flexibility makes them impractical for 
performance-critical uses. In particular, WebGL often wants to deal with arrays 
of a specific type &mdash; an array of integers, an array of floats, etc. Even 
more complicated is the need to manage multiple types within a single memory 
region; for performance, it&rsquo;s often preferable to allocate one chunk of 
video memory, and place coordinates, colors, and other types in there, 
replacing them as necessary.</p> 
<p>There are two portions to the solution: the WebGLArrayBuffer and a set of 
typed WebGLArray views. A WebGLArrayBuffer represents chunk of data. It can be 
allocated with a size in bytes, but it can&rsquo;t be accessed in any way. To 
actually manipulate the data inside a WebGLArrayBuffer, a WebGLArray has to be 
created that references it. An example:</p> 
<pre>var buf = new WebGLArrayBuffer(3*4); var floats = new 
WebGLFloatArray(buf); floats[0] = 12.3; floats[1] = 23.4; floats[2] = 34.5;
</pre> 
<p>The above chunk of code allocates a 12-byte WebGLArrayBuffer, and then 
creates a float-typed view onto the buffer which can then be manipulated 
(almost) like a normal array. Of course, the above is cumbersome to write, so 
there are shorthands that will allocate a WebGLArrayBuffer, and optionally fill 
it with data from a JS array:</p> 
<pre>var f1 = new WebGLFloatArray(3); var f2 = new WebGLFloatArray([12.3, 
23.4, 34.5]);</pre> 
<p>The size of each WebGLArrayBuffer is fixed; there is currently no way to 
change its size once allocated.</p> 
<p>Multiple WebGLArrays can reference the same WebGLArrayBuffer. For example:
</p> 
<pre>var buf = new WebGLArrayBuffer(12*3*4+12*4); var points = new 
WebGLFloatArray(buf, 0, 12*3); var colors = new WebGLUnsignedByteArray(buf, 
12*3*4, 12*4);</pre> 
<p>This creates a buffer of 192 bytes, which is enough room for 12 
3-coordinate float points followed by 12 RGBA colors, with each component 
represented as an unsigned byte. The arguments to the WebGLArray constructors 
are the offset from the start of the buffer (in bytes), and the length (in 
elements). The offset must always be a multiple of the element size (to 
preserve alignment), and the buffer must obviously be large enough for the 
given offset and length. If length is not given, the length is assumed to be 
&ldquo;from offset until the end of the array buffer&rdquo;; that value must be 
a multiple of the element size. If offset is not given, it&rsquo;s assumed to 
be zero.</p> 
<p>For extra complex use cases, WebGLArrays can reference overlapping regions 
of a WebGLArrayBuffer:</p> 
<pre>var buf = new WebGLArrayBuffer(192); // same value from above var points 
= new WebGLFloatArray(buf); var colors = new WebGLUnsignedByteArray(buf); 
points[0] = 12.3; points[1] = 23.4; points[2] = 34.5; colors[12] = 0xff; 
colors[13] = 0xaa; colors[14] = 0x00; colors[15] = 0x00;</pre> 
<p>In the buffer, this writes 3 float values followed by 4 byte values. 
You&rsquo;ll note that this use is significantly more complex, and requires the 
user to keep track of the current position in terms of whatever element 
they&rsquo;re modifying (thus setting array elements 12, 13, 14, and 15 for the 
color).</p> 
<p>If an attempt is made to store data in a WebGLArray that doesn&rsquo;t fit 
within the right type, a C-style cast is performed. If the data is an entirely 
wrong type (e.g. trying to store a string or an object), Gecko currently throws 
an exception, but this might become a silent 0 or similar in the future.</p> 
<p>Where does this fit in WebGL? Any API function that needs an array of data 
takes a WebGLArrayBuffer. This avoids placing costly JS array type conversion 
in a potential critical performance path, and simplifies a number of aspects of 
the API. So, VBOs, texture data (if not loaded from a DOM image element or from 
a CanvasImageData object), index array, etc. all use 
WebGLArrayBuffers/WebGLArrays for pulling data in and out. WebGLArrays also 
help manage memory usage &mdash; an array of byte color data now takes up 
exactly as much memory as needed, instead of getting expanded out to 4 bytes. 
Also, critically, floating point data can be stored as 32-bit single-precision 
floats instead of 64-bit doubles, taking up half as much space when the 
underlying graphics system can&rsquo;t support 64-bit values.</p> 
<p>This API is overall lacking in developer niceties, since the focus was on 
providing the necessary functionality. Higher level wrappers can be written in 
JS to simplify usage. In addition, by keeping it as bare-bones as it is, it 
allows for fast implementation on native hardware via the JITs in all the 
current-generation JS engines. The web currently fudges around the problem of 
binary data by passing it around either in strings (because JS strings are 
UCS2, therefore all 8-bit elements are valid, but with a performance and 
memeory cost), or often encoding as base64 (again going back to strings). I can 
see this type of dense/native type access being useful for both the File and 
WebSockets APIs as a way to exchange and deal with binary data.</p> <br>

<h3>Firefox Application Directory Lockdown</h3> 2&nbsp;Comments Published by 
vladimir October 23rd, 2009 in Firefox, Mozilla <br>

<p>Starting with Firefox 3.6, only well-known components shipped with Firefox 
will be loaded from the application components directory.&nbsp; Any other 
components (both binary and script) will be ignored.&nbsp; This work might also 
be backported to the 3.5 branch, but that decision has not been made yet.&nbsp; 
There are a number of reasons why this decision was made.</p> 
<p>Firefox, through Gecko, has always had a flexible component-based 
architecture.&nbsp; In particular, creating binary components to interface with 
the OS or with other applications is fairly straightforward, though ultimately 
dangerous.&nbsp; Binary components have full access to the application and OS, 
and so can impact stability, security, and performance.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s 
worse, in a binary component, the line between supported/frozen and completely 
unfrozen internal Gecko interfaces is blurred, making it easy to create a 
binary component that works well against one very specific version of Firefox 
(potentially as specific as a minor security release), but causes serious 
problems with any other version.</p> 
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen the popularity of Firefox increase, more and more 
binary components have been written to interface between Firefox and other 
applications.&nbsp; However, we haven&rsquo;t provided great guidance about the 
appropriate way to do so.</p> 
<p><em>The only supported way of adding functionality to Firefox (whether a 
binary component is required or not) isthrough an add-on. </em>This has many 
advantages for users: they can see that additional functionality is installed 
in the Add-ons Manager, and from there they can easily enable or disable it, as 
well as check for and receive updates.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re working on improving 
theuser experience when third-party addons are installed in system-wide 
locations.&nbsp; Also, critically, add-ons include information indicating their 
compatibility with specific versions of Firefox.&nbsp; Having this version 
information allows for safe upgrades, especially when binary components are 
present.</p> 
<p>Currently, third-party applications can drop binary components into the 
Firefox application&rsquo;s components directory and expect them to be loaded 
as part of our normal startup.&nbsp; This causes a number of problems, not the 
least of which is the removal of the user control that add-ons provide.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, a number of third-party applications are using this approach to 
integration, and are currently causing Firefox 3.5 users stability 
problems.&nbsp; Many of these components were written for Firefox 3.0, and have 
not been updated for Firefox 3.5; a situation that we have no way of detecting 
because of the lack of versioning information on these &ldquo;bare&rdquo; 
components.&nbsp; Because a number of internal interfaces changed between the 
two versions, this leads to crashes or other problems when these components are 
used.</p> 
<p>In order to simplify future integration with native code, Firefox 3.6 will 
include support forJSCtypes for add-on developers.&nbsp; This approach is 
greatly preferred over writing binary components.&nbsp; For example, a 
third-party component that would like to perform some action implemented in 
native code when an event is received can write the integration pieces in 
Javascript (capturing the event and so on), and use JSCtypes to make function 
calls to regular non-XPCOM component native code.&nbsp; Keeping as much of 
add-on code in Javascript reduces the impact of internal changes to Firefox, 
and allows for much easier maintainability.</p> 
<p>(If you are a third-party application developer and have questions about 
integration in Firefox, please contact me &mdash; I&rsquo;d be happy to put you 
in touch with the right people who can answer questions and provide guidance.)

<h3>WebGL Samples/Demos and other bits</h3> 5&nbsp;Comments Published by 
vladimir September 21st, 2009 in Canvas 3D, Firefox, Mozilla <br>

<p>Since my post on Friday, we landed a few fixes to improve our WebGL 
implementation and to fix a couple of bugs we discovered on Friday.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what people do with WebGL, and how it can 
be useful on the web right now.&nbsp; For example, EA/Maxis recently added 
COLLADA export of Creature designs to their popular gameSpore, and they have a 
Sporepedia where players can see others&rsquo; creations.&nbsp; Right now, 
those previews are just as images.&nbsp; With WebGL, they could be fully 3D, 
even animated.</p> 
<p>Over the weekend I&rsquo;ve put together this example, which uses WebGL to 
render an exported Spore creature, and let the user rotate the 3D model to view 
it from different angles.&nbsp; For those who want to try it out, you&rsquo;ll 
need a recent Firefox nightly (one from today, September 21, or newer), and 
with one preference flipped as described inthis post.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll be working to update the very basic &ldquo;getting started
&rdquo; demos from the GL ES 2 book that I ported to Canvas 3D as well, so that 
those who are interested in experimenting can have some good basic code to look 
at.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not updated yet, but they should be in the next day or 
two.</p> 
<p>For those of you on Windows who don&rsquo;t have an up to date OpenGL 
driver, or don&rsquo;t have the possibility of getting one (e.g. many common 
Intel graphics cards doesn&rsquo;t have OpenGL drivers), you can enable 
software rendering by downloading a Windows build of the Mesa software OpenGL 
implementation.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t be fast, but it should be enough for you 
to get an idea of what&rsquo;s going on, and to play with some of the 
demos.&nbsp; To use it, downloadwebgl-mesa-751.zip and extract it somewhere on 
your computer.&nbsp; It has a single file, OSMESA32.DLL, that you need to tell 
Firefox where to find:&nbsp; open up about:config, and set the preference<em>
webgl.osmesalib</em> to the path of OSMESA32.DLL.&nbsp; If you extracted it to 
&ldquo;C:\temp&rdquo;, you would put in &ldquo;C:\temp\osmesa32.dll&rdquo; in 
the pref.&nbsp; Then, flip<em>webgl.software_rendering</em> to true, and you 
should be good to go.</p> 
<p>(Mac OS X users shouldn&rsquo;t need to bother with software rendering, 
since Apple already provides a high quality OpenGL implementation, and Linux 
users should be ok as long as they have recent OpenGL drivers installed.)</p>

<h3>WebGL in Firefox Nightly Builds</h3> 23&nbsp;Comments Published by vladimir
 September 18th, 2009 inCanvas 3D, Firefox, Mozilla <br>

<p>Last night, I checked in some more work from Mark Steele (who&rsquo;s 
focusing on the Firefox WebGL implementation), and along with that, enabled 
WebGL in trunk nightlies.&nbsp; (<em>Finally!</em>)</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with WebGL, it&rsquo;s the evolution of work 
that Mozilla starteda few years ago with experiments called Canvas 3D &mdash; 
essentially a way of accessing OpenGL from within the browser, through the 
HTML5 canvas tag.&nbsp; Earlier this year, westarted a standardization effort 
within theKhronos Group which oversees OpenGL, and have made very rapid 
progress.</p> 
<p>Along with the Firefox implementation, a WebGL implementation landed in 
WebKit fairly recently.&nbsp; All of these implementations are going to have 
some interoperability issues for the next little while, as the spec is still in 
flux and we&rsquo;re tracking it at different rates, but will hopefully start 
to stabilize over the next few months.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to experiment with WebGL with a trunk nightly build 
(starting from Friday, September 18th), all you have to do is flip a pref: load 
about:config, search for &ldquo;<strong>webgl</strong>&ldquo;, and double-click 
&ldquo;<strong>webgl.enabled_for_all_sites</strong>&rdquo; to change the value 
from<strong><em>false </em></strong>to <strong><em>true</em></strong>.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;ll currently have the most luck on MacOS X machines or Windows 
machines with up-to-date OpenGL drivers.</p> 
<p>We still have some ways to go, as there are issues in shader security and 
portability, not to mention figuring out what to do on platforms where OpenGL 
is not available.&nbsp; (The latter is an interesting problem; we&rsquo;re 
trying to ensure that the API can be implementable on top of a non-GL native 3D 
API, such as Direct3D, so that might be one option.)&nbsp; But progress is 
being quickly made.</p> 
<p>When paired with high-performance JavaScript, such as what we&rsquo;ve seen 
come from both Firefox and other browsers, should allow for some exciting fully 
3D-enabled web applications.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have some simple demos linked 
for you soon, both here and on Mark&rsquo;s blog.</p> 
<p>Edit: new post up, with some samples!</p> <br>
