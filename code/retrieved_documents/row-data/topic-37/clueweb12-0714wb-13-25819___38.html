<h3>Serious game engine.</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 24, 2012 at 14:59 by MadJack <br>

<p>There isn't much technical information that hasn't been said in the 
previous reviews that I could add so I'll simply add my experience using the 
engine.</p> 
<p>I've been using jME for over a year now and although some learning curves 
are pretty steep on any given platform as far as 3D engines is concerned (think 
quaternions), the vast majority is so transparent that you only need to know 
the basics to properly do things in jME.</p> 
<p>It is easy to use, it has a great community, it is stable and is pretty 
darn fast. Tutorials abound and soon a book will be published explaining many 
technical aspects for the not-so-technical-inclined or the newcomers to the 
engine.</p> 
<p>jME has all the ingredients you will ever need to make your own game. All 
you need is an idea, free time and an eagerness to learn.</p> 
<p>In no time you'll be writing code to make that great idea of yours a 
reality.</p>  2 of 2 people found this review helpful. Did you? Yes No <br>

<h3>Awesome Engine!!!!</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 24, 2012 at 10:37 by wezrule <br>

<p>I have been a user of the jMonkeyEngine (jME) for 9 months. I had never 
created a game, nor did i know any game development lingo, and only had brief 
java experience prior to this. jME taught me everything i know, with the best 
and most explained tutorials i have seen. A great community backing on the 
forums, have made this experience an enjoyable one. I have come to appreciate 
how easy it is to program games using the jMonkeyEngine!</p> 
<p>I cannot claim to be good, as there is so much extensibility that it 
appeals to all levels. I myself have still not delved into the world of 
creating my own shaders, but i cant wait!!!! im sure it will be just as 
enjoyable as the rest.</p> 
<p>jMonkeyEngine brings rapid game development to a new level. It is 
cross-platform, and is constantly improved with up to date features, along with 
a big and growing community base on the forums, make it easy for anyone to 
start programming in it.</p> 
<p>If your wanting to create the game of your dreams, that has been a idea in 
the back of your head for a while, then look no further. If you have no 
experience with creating games, then jME is definitely for you, it will hold 
you hand at the initial stages to get you to grips with everything; then the 
rest will be up to you. It will be a lot of hard work, but the finished result 
will be worth it, trust me!</p> 
<p>Advantages <br>
- FREE <br>
- Rapid cross-platform development (including 
Android)<br>
- Has it's own IDE (based on Netbeans) <br>
- Best and most 
explained tutorials i've ever seen<br>
- Great community <br>
- Only limit is 
your imagination!</p> 
<p>Disadvantages <br>
- Biggest problem I have had is importing models <br>
- 
Game templates of varying popular genres would be beneficial</p>  2 of 2 people

<h3>Great Engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 24, 2012 at 13:56 by oxplay <br>

<p>i have tried many engines before, but JME is my final choise.</p> 
<p>Advantages: <br>
- it is openSource, based on New BSD license. <br>
- 
Engine is fully shader based(every material is based on material definition, 
which is based on shaders)<br>
- with wrapper for openGL(based on LWJGL) and 
perfect code give a good efficiency<br>
- Very good community(everyone can help 
on the forum)<br>
- Good SDK(give us editors for everything, like code, models, 
materials, scenes, animations and many more)<br>
- Its good for small and big 
projects. Code is very scalable. We can use ready to use classes or just make 
our own<br>
- Actually it have everything i need(skeletal/etc animations, 
efects(bloom, dof and many more), shaders, network, gui.... just everything)<br>
- Every multithread actions can be easily synchronized<br>
- It is continuously 
developed and improved(noone want abandoned projects). Its very active all the 
time :)</p> 
<p>Disadvantages: <br>
- I started learning it 8 months ago and i remember 
that was sometimes similar problems(able to resolve) with exporting models from 
blender<br>
- For a browser games: there is possibility of applet, but it would 
be better to have webGL or webplayer based solution</p>  1 of 1 people found

<h3>The Engine for Your Games!</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 24, 2012 at 12:52 by Nicholas 
Mamo <br>

<p>With just a little Java knowledge and some experience with amateur game 
making software Game Maker, I tried to look for something more substantial - 
and that was what I stumbled upon. jME is truly a hidden gem. Anyone with at 
least basic Java knowledge could easily use this - and after following the 
first few tutorials, make a small game.</p> 
<p>Combined with the helpful tutorials, the forum community makes this game 
development software one of the best in its category, even if this engine 
doesn't get the attention it deserves.</p> 
<p>Advantages: <br>
Great tutorials <br>
Helpful and active community <br>

Getting better each day</p> 
<p>Disadvantages: <br>
The only disadvantage is that it might take a little 
bit of time to piece the tutorials together to form your first game - but the 
community is always there!</p> 
<p>So grab this engine and start creating games. Your imagination is the only 
limit!</p>  1 of 1 people found this review helpful. Did you? Yes No <br>

<h3>Best 3D Java Engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 24, 2012 at 22:11 by InShadow <br>

<p>I have been using this engine for hobby projects for more than 3 years, 
since jME2. I can say that its definitely the best engine for 3D graphics 
programming in Java. It matured over years a lot and is now a really modern 
engine, almost capable of standing aside the big ones. :) Ok maybe it doesn't 
have all the tools and features, but community is awesome, development of your 
own game is fast and easy and anyone has the opportunity to improve the engine 
and introduce its own ideas.<br>
Well, check the showcase. ;)</p>  0 of 0

<h3>Decent engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Jun 16, 2009 at 13:23 by Guest <br>

<p>I've been using this engine for about 8 months - very intense. <br>
What I 
found out is, that this engine has many features, is fast and very stable.<br>

This engine is very good to start with if you have zero 3D programming 
experience, because there are many tutorials of code samples which show you how 
to get started with basic examples.<br>
Furthermore there are tons of sample 
codes which show you the engine's features and graphics capabilites. You can 
easily learn by watching through the (mostly small samplecodes) and adapt them 
to your own projects!</p> 
<p>There are also some negative aspects as well which are: <br>
The community 
was left alone by the last active developers in autumn 2008. Since then I 
didn't see much innovations going on anymore. To be realistic: I call it dead.
<br>If you are asking for new features there is no one who will implement that. 
The community which is left alone suggests you to implement missing features 
yourself. But to be honest: many people (including me) are not that good in 3D 
programming to implement effects like real time shadows, per-pixel-lighting, 
HDR etc. It is easier to use an engine, than to implement new graphical 
features or special effects. And since there is no developer anymore, nobody 
will care about it in decent time, maybe never ever.</p> 
<p>This is the worst thing that can happen to an OpenSource Engine and it did 
happen to jME.</p> 
<p>Besides the support is good when it comes to easy problems, but again: if 
the difficulty gets higher, nobody can help you anymore.</p> 
<p>If you are planning to create a commercial game, I would say that jME is 
definitely able to take the plunge, because it is fast, stable, offers a lot of 
features and also platform independent.<br>
But if you really want to create a 
serious game project you need to create everything by yourself. And by 
everything I mean EVERYTHING.<br>
There is not even a useful World Editor 
around for the engine and if you ever tried to program a world editor, you will 
experience that it eats up a lot of time.<br>
In fact there is a World Editor 
which is called MonkeyWorld3D. I appreciate the effort of the team who created 
it, but the Editor is slow, buggy and inconvenient to use. Also many features 
are missing. I really cannot recommend it. Also most people of the community 
seem to feel the same, since no one touches this editor and instead tries to 
create his own version of an editor.</p> 
<p>I did not only use the engine itself, but also the 3D GUI ilibrary like 
FengGUI and the jME Physics library. Both are NOT included in jME. They are 3rd 
party libraries, however they are very compatible.<br>
FengGUI is very good and 
should get most game graphical user interfaces working.<br>
The physics library 
is also very good with a downside however. If you do some playing with boxes 
and balls the fun is on your side, but if you try to create a physics-based 
charactermodel you will most likely NOT succeed or you will bite your teeth out 
to achieve that.</p> 
<p>jME is like a sandbox. You can create the Eiffel-Tower out of it, but you 
must do everything yourself. It is very good when you are starting from zero, 
because you have the feeling everything is under control. But if you are 
looking for something that will ease up your work in progress this engine does 
not offer the features.</p> 
<p>All in all I can recommend the engine for beginners, but for serious 
projects you might turn to another game engine. Btw. the last developer created 
a new engine called &quot;ardor3d&quot; which shall be cleaner and better (and 
of course it sounds much better than &quot;MonkeyEngine&quot; ;-) ) than jME. I 
tried it out some time ago and in fact many things are made easier e.g. 
mousepicking. Also it includes every feature from jME and is developed actively.
<br>Sadly, there are much less sample codes for learning purpose than in jME 
which will make it harder for beginners. But maybe this will change in future.
</p> 
<p>I am not sure but I think the physics &amp; fenggui are not be compatible 
to that anymore. Hopefully this will change too.</p>  0 of 0 people found this

<h3>Seems to follow the same'ol J3d pattern</h3>  &nbsp;  May 27, 2009 at 
22:24 bytemporaryuser <br>

<p>I am not so much reviewing this engine as pointing out the obvious. Hockey 
challenge (active a few years ago?), no sign of it today. Tech showcases of it 
seem amateur, and unambitious (also a Java pattern), and not to mention it's 
based on Java. Sun microsystems have mis-managed Java from the beginning. I 
believe Java should deliver clean, fast code to power feature rich engines and 
games but just doesn't, even now, years after all the jME flurry and a decade 
after the release of Java itself - clearly not a good sign. I have to bow down 
and confess that I may have been wrong about Java - it's just not likely to be 
used for anything of consequence in gaming. (hope I'm wrong, really do)<br>
And 
with Sun's mis-management, I wouldn't be surprised if they get a good thing 
going with the engine, and then a year later..game no longer works due to 
deprecated API or some other Java screw up. A real shame. But, the guys behind 
jME are I'm sure really competent. At least they should find new jobs in Java 
programming, and/or engine design/coding etc. A straight average.</p>  0 of 0

<h3>Great Engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Oct 01, 2008 at 17:41 by Jedimace1 <br>

<p>Proves that the &quot;Java is slow&quot; idea is completely wrong! This is 
a very stable engine in development with the best, supportive community I have 
ever come across. This is a much better engine then many I have seen, beating a 
lot of them in performance(even faster then Torque, I have run both on the same 
computer), support, ease of use, and features. It has some of the best water 
effects I have seen, and it is all very easy to use and completely functional.

<h3>Damn good and getting better</h3>  &nbsp;  Apr 10, 2008 at 01:54 by 
Cyberqat <br>

<p>JME is a very solid scene graph engine built ontop of Cas's LWJGL. The 
result is light weight, fast and modern with all the productivity advantages of 
java. It is currently being used by a number of commercial projects, both 
inside and outside of the game industry, that contribute valuable resources 
back to the project.</p> 
<p>Another poster suggested wrapping other C engines calls with JNI java 
wrappers. This is a very bad idea, as anyone who has done high performance Java 
coding can tell you. JNI is no automatic panacea Crossing the JNI boundaries 
has costs. You want to as little of that as possible. LWJGL makes use of Java 
native direct byte buffers to allow it to do all its work in C space rather 
then Java heap and make the least number of calls across the boundaries. JME 
builds ontop of that solid, high speed implementation adding a very well 
designed and functional scene graph.</p> 
<p>It is important to understand what JME *isn't*. The poster also mentioned 
Torque. Torque is a complete game engine, not a scene graph engine. If what you 
are looking for is high level tools then you want to look higher then JME.</p> 
<p>If your looking for professional support, you also may want to look at 
professional (costly) engines. The JME community is very active and Josh and 
Mark are very helpful, but it is very much an open source community that 
operates on a traditional open source model. If you need to fix something, they 
may give you some pointers to where to look, but if its important to you that 
it be fixed now be ready to do it yourself. The flip side is that the code 
quality is excellent to work with and there a great deal of satisfaction in 
being able to contribute fixes or extensions back to the group.</p> 
<p>The only two things I can say negatively about are: <br>
(1) The engine is 
currently mono-threaded.<br>
(2) The Java docs are not always complete.</p> 
<p>Number one I know is being worked on right now. Number two I'm not sure 
about.</p> 
<p>In short, if you want to build your own game engine then JME is a great 
labor saving place to start. The community is very active and the code first 
rate.</p>  0 of 0 people found this review helpful. Did you? Yes No <br>

<h3>jME isn't all that</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 29, 2008 at 06:37 by mr_guy <br>

<p>I would assume that the glowing reviews come from people who have either 
not used another game engine, or who are so desperate for anything Java, that 
they're willing to put up with any crap, as long as they can (slowly) render a 
model to the screen.</p> 
<p>I've used it, and it does not hold up to engines like Ogre3D, or 
OpenSceneGraph, or even Torque Game Engine. Some problems:</p> 
<p>1) There is no way to get skinned animation into the engine. The developers 
apparently have a COLLADA exporter script that they use internally, but have 
not released. Regular COLLDA animations are not recognized by the importer.</p> 
<p>2) The other importers are all crappy. It seems par for the course that 
they only support a single mesh, or a single texture, or no animation, or all 
three.</p> 
<p>3) The internal data structures in jME show no understanding of rendering 
hardware. Colors are expanded to 16 bytes. Vertices are stored with one vertex 
buffer per channel, not as interleaved data. Each separate subset of a mesh is 
stored as a totally separate mesh, with separate buffers. The list goes on.</p> 
<p>4) Originally, jME didn't even support instancing of meshes. Each tree in a 
forest would have its own multiple vertex buffers. To support instancing, they 
added a special &quot;instancing node&quot; which gets passed the regular mesh 
scene graph node. This example shows that the implementation is made by people 
who haven't done scene graphs before, and there are lots more.</p> 
<p>5) The community likes patting itself on the back, but more importantly, it 
doesn't make any distinction between &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; Even 
if code is totally broken and doesn't do anything near what it's supposed to 
do, you'll be hard pressed to get a &quot;oh, that's bad&quot; out of them. And 
even some basic things, like matrices and quaternions, have bugs in them.</p> 
<p>6) The design of the scene graph is taken from Dave Eberly's &quot;Wild 
Magic&quot; books -- version 2. Dave himself is up to version 4. However, where 
Dave has good implementation (even if I don't like his design), jME hasn't, and 
it hasn't kept up to date with the many improvements that have happend in 
versions 3 and 4.</p> 
<p>So, it may be true that jME is the best open engine that is out there for 
Java. That means that 3D games using an open Java engine are in a pretty poor 
state. You'll be better off wrapping something real, even if you have to write 
your own JNI bindings. (The Multiverse people wrapping Ogre3D come to mind as 
an alternative)</p> 
<p>If your goal is just a good game engine, and you don't require Java, run as 
far away as you can -- it's not worth the time spent trying to understand how 
limited this engine is. Or prepare to spend significant effort to bring it up 
to snuff -- which probably is easier than starting your own from scratch, if 
that's the alternative.</p>  0 of 0 people found this review helpful. Did you?

<h3>Why I love jME and how I came to it</h3>  &nbsp;  Jun 12, 2007 at 00:56 by 
paranoid <br>

<p>Hi fellow coders,</p> 
<p>I have a long background in testing 3d Frameworks... ( who here hasn't :-) )
</p> 
<p>Obviously I started my own with 2D calls, then I wrote some Quake3 mods, 
then opengl, then<br>
I took a major leap and bought the torque engine from 
garagegames.</p> 
<p>Man that was a fun time, that &ldquo;framework&rdquo; is really complete as 
the code comes from a real game ( StarSiege Tribes ), complete with ingame 
level editor, gui, 3d sound and prize winning network support ( now free ). But 
I soon had to find out, that you could only go so far with its scripting 
language and its c++ code, although probably very clean and good, just scared 
the hell out of me...<br>
( Free tip to garagegames to reign the world, 
reimplement the scripting language in java ! )</p> 
<p>Then I tried irrlicht ( with its NET plugin and Delpi.NET which was even 
kind of cool... just very basic and not a complete gaming framework ), then 
ogre3d, then openscenegraph and then even some more things google spits out...
</p> 
<p>Meanwhile I always played with Java and its 2D calls, as I love Java. <br>

So I decided to give Java3D a try, but boy was that painful and I gave up for a 
while.</p> 
<p>Years later I stumbled across Jake2 ( awesome Java port of Quake2 ) <br>

which started my fire again.<br>
So Java is capable of high performance 3D 
after all. :-)</p> 
<p>I again looked for news around Java3D and found the very impressive 
FlyingGuns...<br>
Looking for books about java and gaming I found a great book 
from Andrew Davison<br>
 ( Killer Game Programming in Java - 
http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/ )</p> 
<p>But after reading most of it I realized, he does a good job of overcoming 
the limitations of Java3D but not good enough for me...<br>
As Java3D is really 
&quot;only&quot; a scene graph framework written in Java... and not a very fast 
one... ( although pretty ok, if you look at Flying Guns )</p> 
<p>Most of all, the slow &quot;collision detection&quot; turned me off... <br>

( Andrew Davison had tried to overcome the limitations with a 1 second taking 
background thread, man was that ugly... )</p> 
<p>Then I looked at xith3d, but that is mostly the same framework, just 
faster...<br>
And still missing good collision detection ( AFAIK )</p> 
<p>I realized what I really was looking for, was a modding framework, 
something like quake3 just not so fps/bsp-level orientated and with much less c 
code</p> 
<p>In the java gaming and xith forums I had always seen references to jME, but 
I never looked at the examples before...</p> 
<p>3 Month ago I did, and boy was I impressed !!! <br>
( just give 
jmetest.effects.water.TestProjectedWater a try !!! )</p> 
<p>The framework is not only powerful and feature rich but truly easy to use !
</p> 
<p>The learning curve is as good as it gets, due to the easy transition from 
SimpleGame to StandardGame ( if you understand not to overwrite initSystem and 
forget to call the super implementation as I did at first... )</p> 
<p>The tutorials are very good to understand, because they can be very short, 
due to the fact that jME is so powerful with so few lines...<br>
The flag rush 
tutorial especially stands out ( hehe, no wonder, as it comes very close to my 
BattleZone clone project ).<br>
Thanks mojomonkey !!!</p> 
<p>The test package covers many real world game application needs: <br>
-game 
state changes ( swing, menus, loader, ... )<br>
-Swing GUI menu support ( This 
one is one of my favorites )<br>
-hw/sw mouse <br>
-all the different 
InputHandler (they rock and one can learn alot about camera translation and 
rotation )<br>
-3d audio <br>
-headless mode for servers <br>
-water and cloth 
effects<br>
-bump mapping <br>
-particles support and examples <br>
-terrain 
support with many very very good examples !!!<br>
-all the 3D object importers 
and exporters...<br>
-last but not least: my kids love the LisaSimpson modell, 
so my wife lets me code ! :-)</p> 
<p>Little things just work as expected ( anyone who tried to get alt-tab to 
work with a fullscreen Java 3D app knows what im talking about - oh and to get 
it fullscreen was painful to start with I recall... )</p> 
<p>So after searching and trying out for so long ( I am speaking about 14 
years here ) I think I can finally settle.<br>
Thanks to all the monkeys !!!</p>

<h3>jME never say die</h3>  &nbsp;  Mar 17, 2007 at 16:10 by hytparadisee <br>

<p>After years of evolving jME said itself only up to 0.11, can't imagine how 
far will it go once it becomes 1.0. Keep up the good work banana followers!! 
And also, the community is so consolidated that at first glance, the project 
was inactive, but once you know it, wow so many genius monkeys are hidden 
inside the CVS, weaving their dreams for the next generation virtual realism, 
in a programming language that has unparalled competitiveness.</p>  0 of 0

<h3>The right choice for Java 3d game development</h3>  &nbsp;  Feb 04, 2007 
at 02:21 byHandyman <br>

<p>I started evaluating Java engines about 6 months ago and you quickly 
realize that if you want anything close to complete out-of-the-box then there 
are two choices: Xith and jMonkey. The choice between the two is going to be 
needs-dependent but some of my criterion, which I suspect are pretty common, 
are:<br>
1) Both are BSD Licensed (AFAIK). This is great news if you plan to do 
anything that you may only want to release pieces (or none) of.<br>
2) Both 
support COLLADA assets. Anyone working with artists should know, but probably 
doesn't yet, just how important this is to making an easy tool chain. Its not 
in very wide use yet but it will be.<br>
3) A JOGL implementation (instead of 
just LWJGL, which is also great) takes a lot of the sting out of distributing 
the final product; especially if its an applet or something. This is due to Sun 
distribution and support of JOGL and the issues with WebStart warnings or 
applet-sandbox restrictions. Only Xith has that right now but one is said to be 
on the way for jMonkey (not holding my breath tho).<br>
4) Animation. 3D Games 
without animation are a tough sell. Xith supports vertex animation but jMonkey 
supports that and skeletal animation.<br>
5) Download size. This is mostly a 
red-herring issue since assets dominate the download in any real game but 
jMonkey seems easier to strip of the stuff you don't need.<br>
6) jMonkey is 
based on Dave Eberly's (old) scene-graph. This is the best-architected 
scene-graph in the business, bar none, and a lot of commercial engines come 
from it (it is the mother of Gamebryo, after all). Some of the things that were 
annoying about it (from before his last Game Engine Design edition came out) 
are in jMonkey but they aren't huge deals and its still much more intuitive 
than the Xith structure, which looks like it might get confusing with a very 
complex scene.<br>
7) The dev-community. Both are very strong with great people 
who are willing to help. No difference here.</p> 
<p>For my purposes, it came down to #3 vs #4. Knowing that animation was going 
to be my performance bottleneck, I can't use vertex animation. Skeletal is also 
often a lot less painful for artists, a lot easier to update, and produces MUCH 
smaller animation assets (which can be a huge part of a download if not done 
wisely). But I also can't go without JOGL for the previously mentioned reasons. 
Writing a skeletal animation package sounds much harder than converting LWJGL 
code to JOGL (they are somewhat similar). Decision made. You can't go 
completely wrong with either but you might want to keep these things in mind.

<h3>Great !!</h3>  &nbsp;  Oct 08, 2006 at 02:31 by Baune <br>

<p>This is by far the most active Java based engine I've seen so far. <br>

What really strikes me is the activity surrounding this engine..only other 
engine with an active community like this I can think of is Ogre and maybe 
Torque. Once a week I press &quot;update&quot; in my CVS client and voila..new 
updates and bug fixes downloaded..the creators are very dedicated for sure.</p> 
<p>Features are OK by most standards..I would put this engine at about equal 
to ogre featurevise.<br>
Of course this is not a Game engine..you would have to 
code alot yourself..but by alot I mean 2-3 lines of code to get shadows, 2-3 
lines of code to setup ligth etc.<br>
I tried Ogre before and JME is much like 
Ogre, in many ways you can consider it Ogre in Java version, just easier.<br>

Everything is very easy to code with tons of sample code to guide you. 
Everything is very intuitive and once you get the basic idea you rarely need 
too look up the tutorials again (tutorails are community driven and fairly 
good).</p> 
<p>If you think Java is slow..think again ! Since everything of course is 
coded in opengl behind the scenes, you dont see any slowness nowhere..and Java 
being slow is a myth.<br>
Another good thing about Java..you don't have to wait 
for ages for typical c++ style compiling and linking. Java compiles FAST !! 
Example, the engine , complete with about 200 classes or so, builds in about a 
minute !</p> 
<p>Again you might argue that it's not cutting edge, but if you want cutting 
edge prepare to pay ! Again, as active as this team is, they will put cutting 
edge features in there just for the hell of it. I would argue that JME have 
most needs covered AND you have the advantage of having free state of the art 
IDE's like Netbeans and Eclipse at your disposal PLUS the enourmous code 
repository of the Java world itself. In the very competetive world of 
gameengines/rendering libraries JME has made its mark and cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>jME is a fantastic Java based scene graph engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Jul 20, 
2006 at 12:40 bydougnukem <br>

<p>I've been learning OpenGL and game programming for awhile, and jME has got 
to be the easiest to get started with engine I've ever used. Not only is it 
easy but with all the features they provide, terrain generation, configurable 
renderers to produce fantastic effects, you can do almost anything with it.</p> 
<p>The community surrounding jME is also fantastic, they're always willing to 
help and the response is almost immediate to any question you have. Very active 
community, I definetly think this engine is going to be playing a major role in 
Java game development in the near future, seeing as major game companies have 
picked it up for their own use including ThreeRings, and NCSoft.</p>  0 of 0

<h3>Good engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Apr 10, 2006 at 03:05 by Darklord <br>

<p>This engine is the only engine that's written in Java, has alot of 
documentation and is worthy of your attention in my oppinion. There are others 
but as I will try to explain, this one is the best at the moment.</p> 
<p>The community is always happy to help. JmonkeyEngine is a fitting answer if 
you want to make a game in Java. This is the best you'll get if you want to 
develop with Java. Naturally you are free to build your own engine but this 
gameengine is well documented, the biggest drawbacks of others</p> 
<p>The reason for me to work with Java is mainly due to the decreased overhead 
a project brings.. skipping the &quot;chores&quot; you get from C++ (pointer 
assigning, garbage collection and not in the last place the crossplatform 
support) and focussing on what matters most, getting your game content done.</p>
<p>It uses OpenGL which at the moment is equal to Direct3D (DirectX). </p> 
<p>This engine is good for: <br>
People who want to develop games with Java 
<br>People who are new to the game development scene</p> 
<p>This engine is not good for: <br>
People who want a bleeding-edge game 
engine (This engine is free after all.. if you need it then you will have to 
pay)<br>
People who are proficient with C++ and have no knowledge of Java.</p>

<h3>Nice, neat, easy to use engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Mar 21, 2006 at 22:49 by 
shingoki <br>

<p>I've been looking for a Java engine for some time, but I've always been put 
off by poor demos, lack of documentation, and bad performance. I haven't been 
using jME for too long, but already I've got a lot more done than I expected, 
with models imported, terrain set up with custom shaders for water effects, and 
I'm almost ready to actually start putting the game itself together. Whenever 
I've wanted to do something, I've found there is a Test class for it, which can 
be launched from a nice chooser, with decent source comments to let you know 
what is going on. The way everything is put together makes a lot of sense, and 
it seems like the engine is in active development.</p> 
<p>Some areas are lacking at the moment, but there is a plan for future 
versions, which is great to see. The best thing is that because the 
architecture makes sense, it doesn't seem to be much of a problem to just add 
features yourself. None of the missing areas are showstoppers for me, but I 
think at the moment the engine might be better suited for people working on new 
ideas, rather than those who want a plug and play FPS engine for example. Not 
that I'm aware of a free Java implementation of one of those existing...</p> 
<p>There seems to be a pretty active forum, with people working at adding 
interesting stuff - a good example is the blender exporter which does a good 
job of getting meshes from blender to jME. It's not quite complete, but in very 
active development.</p> 
<p>I'd really recommend having a look at the webstart demos, but bear in mind 
there are a LOT more demos if you download the source from CVS (which is again 
pretty well organised, with a good tutorial on getting it set up).</p>  0 of 0

<h3>Bringing The Game Arena To Java</h3>  &nbsp;  Jan 18, 2006 at 21:15 by 
darkfrog <br>

<p>The jME engine is by far the best scenegraph engine available in Java. 
Offering a plethora of great features matched with unparalleled support it is 
making Java a real power in game development. I look forward to see where this 
engine ends up, it's stable and capable now, but there is so much more on the 
horizon.</p>  0 of 0 people found this review helpful. Did you? Yes No <br>

<h3>jME - From a new user's perspective.</h3>  &nbsp;  Jun 17, 2005 at 18:46 by
Einheri <br>

<p>First of all, understand that my star-ratings are mainly in comparison with 
other Java game engines/APIs; not to say that jME couldn't stand its ground 
against those for other languages, mind you!</p> 
<p>I came to jME not very long ago at all as a relatively new Java programmer 
(although I've been programming other languages for a fair while) and even 
though I've only been using it for less than a week I've already managed to get 
a simple game up and running based on the excellent tutorials available on the 
website. Having used other engines in the past, I must say that this learning 
curve is remarkable and that I have never encountered a more conistantly well 
designed engine; although the tutorials are complete in their explanations, the 
commented code they provide is usually more than enough to get an understanding 
of what's going on, and how many engines can claim that?</p> 
<p>As for performance, I was honestly shocked by how well the engine holds up. 
I had chosen Java for my next game project for portability and deployment 
reasons, but the performance of both the languange and the jME engine coupled 
with the speed at which they allow you to get your project off the ground 
should make the combination a prime choice for amatuer game developers 
everywhere, regardless of whether they need their games to be portable or not. 
Do not for a minute believe the &quot;Java is too slow for games&quot; myths!
</p> 
<p>And most important of all, the documentation is head and shoulders above 
that of any other open source Java engine and the community has been amazingly 
helpful regarding the few problems I've had so far, with a browsing of the 
forums revealing this to be the rule rather than the exception.</p> 
<p>All in all, jME is a relatively easy to use engine made even simpler by the 
fantastic tutorials and user community; I would not hesitate recommend it, and 
the Java language, to anyone looking to begin 3D game development.</p>  0 of 0

<h3>jME - Great Engine</h3>  &nbsp;  Jun 15, 2005 at 01:01 by errcw <br>

<p>jME is a fantastic engine. It has an active and extremely supportive 
developer community, excellent getting started material, and a very 
straightforward API. The feature set continues to grow at a frantic pace, and 
enhancements are committed to CVS daily.</p> 
<p>jME has matured significantly since its previous releases. The 
documentation is far more comprehensive, the API has been partitioned into 
sensible functional sets to allow for smaller distributions, numerous stability 
and performance issues have been resolved.</p> 
<p>I will not claim that jME is perfect. However, despite its occasional 
glitches, it is a fantastic engine!</p>  0 of 0 people found this review

<h3>Destined for greatness</h3>  &nbsp;  Jun 11, 2005 at 10:23 by 
chaosdeathfish <br>

<p>jME is the first engine I've really got interested in using, mainly because 
of the simple tutorials and the amazing support from the users! The forum users 
go out of their way to help newbies (you can find the answer to almost any 
question about jME you could ask on the forums).</p> 
<p>Although it hasn't got the best feature set (yet!), the engine is in very 
active development, and user code is always happily accepted, in the true 
spirit of open source!</p> 
<p>This engine is destined for great things.</p>  0 of 0 people found this
