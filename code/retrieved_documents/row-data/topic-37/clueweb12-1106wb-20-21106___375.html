Description: Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases The Analysis Console for 
Intrusion Databases (ACID) is a PHP-based analysis engine to search and process 
a database of security events generated by various IDSes, firewalls, and 
network monitoring tools. The features currently include: . o Query-builder and 
search interface for finding alerts matching on alert meta information (e.g. 
signature, detection time) as well as the underlying network evidence (e.g. 
source/destination address, ports, payload, or flags). . o Packet viewer 
(decoder) will graphically display the layer-3 and layer-4 packet information 
of logged alerts . o Alert management by providing constructs to logically 
group alerts to create incidents (alert groups), deleting the handled alerts or 
false positives, exporting to email for collaboration, or archiving of alerts 
to transfer them between alert databases. . o Chart and statistic generation 
based on time, sensor, signature, protocol, IP address, TCP/UDP ports, or 
classification . ACID has the ability to analyze a wide variety of events which 
are post-processed into its database. Tools exist for the following formats: . 
o using Snort (www.snort.org) - Snort alerts - tcpdump binary logs . o using 
logsnorter (www.snort.org/downloads/logsnorter-0.2.tar.gz) - Cisco PIX - 
ipchains - iptables - ipfw . Homepage: http://acidlab.sourceforge.net/ </li>

Description: ALSA driver configuration files This package contains various 
configuration files for the ALSA drivers. . For ALSA to work on a system with a 
given sound card, there must be an ALSA driver for that card in the kernel. 
Linux 2.6 as shipped in linux-image packages contains ALSA drivers for all 
supported sound cards in the form of loadable modules. For either Linux 2.6 or 
Linux 2.4 a custom alsa-modules package can be built from the sources in the 
alsa-source package using the make-kpkg utility (included in the kernel-package 
package). Some pre-built alsa-modules packages are available in the Debian 
archive. Please read the README.Debian file for information about loading 
modules. . ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

Description: ALSA wrapper for OSS applications This package contains a program 
loader, aoss, which wraps applications written for OSS in a compatibility 
library, thus allowing them to work with ALSA. . There are two ways of getting 
an application to work with ALSA if the application was written for OSS. The 
first way is to load the special ALSA drivers that emulate the OSS kernel 
interface; these allow the application to open /dev/dsp0 and other OSS device 
files. The second way is to wrap the application in the libaoss library 
provided in this package; the wrapper causes the application to access native 
ALSA device files such as /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c instead of OSS device files. . Use 
of the alsa-oss library is recommended over the use of OSS-emulation drivers if 
you want to use ALSA's PCM plugin layer. . ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound

be used either as a standalone application or embedded in other programs. Its 
main feature is that it does a much better job of suggesting possible spellings 
than just about any other spell-checker available for the English language, 
including Ispell and Microsoft Word. It also has many other technical 
enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries and 
intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell process 
is open at once. . Aspell is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Ispell. .

Description: Open Source Private Branch Exchange (PBX) Asterisk is an Open 
Source telephony switching and private branch exchange daemon. It is built with 
a modular architecture for hardware interfaces and telephony applications. A 
large number of switching and packet voice protocols and a variety of hardware 
interfaces are supported, and more are in development. . It supports a wide 
range of TDM protocols for the handling and transmission of voice over 
traditional telephony interfaces. Asterisk supports US and European standard 
signalling types used in standard business phone systems, allowing it to bridge 
between next generation voice-data integrated networks and existing 
infrastucture. Asterisk not only supports traditional phone equipment, it 
enhances them with additional capabilities. . Using the IAX Voice over IP 
protocol, Asterisk merges voice and data traffic seemlessly across disparate 
networks. While using Packet Voice, it is possible to send data such as URL 
information and images in-line with voice traffic, allowing advanced 
integration of information. . Asterisk provides a central switching core, with 
four APIs for modular loading of telephony applications, hardware interfaces, 
file format handling, and codecs. It allows for transparent switching between 
between all supported interfaces, allowing it to tie together a diverse mixture 
of telephony systems into a single switching network. . Currently, most PRI and 
Robbed Bit signalling is supported, as well as BRI(ISDN4Linux). Packet Voice is 
available through the IAX protocol, with H.323 and SIP in development. . To use 
Asterisk right now, you will need at least one of the following: . * OSS 
compatible full-duplex sound card (http://www.opensound.com) * ALSA compatible 
full-duplex sound card (http://www.alsa-project.org) * All Wildcard (tm) 
products from LSS (http://www.linux-support.net) * QuickNet Internet PhoneJack 
and LineJack (http://www.quicknet.net) * Adtran Atlas 800 Plus 
(http://www.adtran.com) * ISDN4Linux compatible ISDN card

 Architecture: i386<br>
 Version: 1.2.53-1.1<br>
 
Description: tar(1) from FreeBSD, using libarchive The bsdtar program has a 
number of advantages over previous tar implementations: . * Library. Since the 
core functionality is in a library, it can be used by other tools, such as 
pkg_add. . * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the 
compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar, pax, cpio, 
iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for any data source. . * Pax 
Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to the old 
&quot;ustar&quot; tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes to each 
entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only better. . * Handles file 
flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange format supports 
key/value attributes using an easily-extensible technique. Arbitrary pathnames, 
group names, user names, file sizes are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive 
extends this with support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers. . 
* GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there is demand, 
this can be improved further. </li>

Description: File Alteration Monitor FAM monitors files and directories, 
notifying interested applications of changes. . This package provides a server 
that can monitor a given list of files and notify applications through a 
socket. If the kernel supports dnotify (kernels &gt;= 2.4.x) FAM is notified 
directly by the kernel. Otherwise it has to poll the files' status. FAM can 
also provide an RPC service for monitoring remote files (such as on a mounted 
NFS filesystem). </li>

<li>Package: fileschanged<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 0.6.5-1~2<br>

 Description: command-line utility that reports when files have been altered 
This software is a client to FAM (File Alteration Monitor). You can use 
fileschanged in shell scripts to take action when monitored files become 
altered. In it's simplest form, you can give filenames to monitor from 
standard-input, and it will report when those files have changed via 
standard-output. In a more complex usage, fileschanged can monitor command-line 
specified files recursively, while following symbolic links, while staying on 
the current filesystem, and reporting deleted files as well as created and 
changed files that haven't been written to for 2 seconds. . Homepage:

<li>Package: greylistd<br>
 Architecture: all<br>
 Version: 0.8.3.0.1<br>
 
Description: Greylisting daemon for use with Exim 4 This daemon provides a 
simple greylisting implementation for use with the Exim Mail Transport Agent 
(MTA), version 4. . Greylisting is a simple but highly effective means to weed 
out messages that are being delivered via spamware/ratware tools. The idea is 
to establish whether a prior relationship exists between the sender and the 
receiver of a message. Most of the time it does, and the delivery proceeds 
normally. . On the other hand, if no prior relationship exists, the delivery is 
temporarily rejected. Legitimate MTAs will treat this response accordingly, and 
retry the delivery in a while. In contrast, ratware will usually fail to retry 
the delivery in a normal fashion. As a result, greylisting is currently more 
than 90% effective in blocking incoming junk mail, while nearly all legitimate 
mail goes through. For more information, see Evan Harris' whitepaper at: 
http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/ . This daemon listens for sender and 
recipient data on a UNIX domain socket. Your MTA would query the daemon during 
the incoming SMTP transaction, and accept or defer the incoming message 
depending on its response. . This package contains a script to configure 
support for greylisting in Exim 4. It may be possible to use greylistd with 
other MTAs as well, though some work will probably be involved. Postfix users 
may want to check out the &quot;postgrey&quot; package instead of this one.

 Version: 11.001~1<br>
 
Description: A utility for building Linux kernel related Debian packages. This 
package provides the capability to create a debian kernel-image package by just 
running make-kpkg kernel_image in a kernel source directory tree. It can also 
package the relevant kernel headers into a kernel-headers package. In general, 
this package is very useful if you need to create a custom kernel, if, for 
example, the default kernel does not support some of your hardware, or you wish 
a leaner, meaner kernel. It also scripts the steps that need be taken to 
compile the kernel, which is quite convenient (forgetting a crucial step once 
was the initial motivation for this package). Please look at

this package. </li>

<br>  Description: Linux kernel source for version 2.6.10 with Debian patches 
This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.6.10. . 
You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing &quot;make config&quot; 
and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and try &quot;make 
menuconfig&quot; for a jazzier, and easier to use interface. There are options 
to use QT or GNOME based configuration interfaces, but they need additional 
packages to be installed. Also, please read the detailed documentation in the 
file /usr/share/doc/kernel-source-2.6.10/README.headers.gz. . If you wish to 
use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it is suggested that you 
investigate the package kernel-package, which has been designed to ease the 
task of creating kernel image packages. </li>

<br>  Description: Linux kernel source tree for building Debian kernel images 
This meta package is used as a build dependency of Debian kernel-image packages 
to prevent a version discrepancy between the kernel-image and corresponding 
kernel-sources packages in the fast-moving unstable archive. The package's 
dependency relations are structured so that a kernel-image package's build 
dependencies can always be satisfied, even if the kernel-source package that 
had been used to compile the image has been superseeded by a newer Debian 
revision since the last build. . The package provides a list of virtual 
packages, corresponding to Debian revisions of a kernel-source package. The 
Debian kernel-patch contains the information needed to roll back the current 
kernel-source to any of the revisions identified by the provided virtual 
packages. Therefore, the kernel-tree package ensures the availability of the 
kernel source tree corresponding to each of the virtual packages listed. . The 
package serves no purpose outside of the Debian build and archive 
infrastructure. </li>

authentication, and more. It is designed to be low-overhead; messages are sent 
using a binary protocol, not using XML. D-BUS also supports a method call 
mapping for its messages, but it is not required; this makes using the system 
quite simple. . D-BUS is still under heavy development, but is expected to be 
widely used. It comes with several interfaces, including GLib. See the

 Description: Mesa OpenGL utility library [X.Org] The 
OpenGL utility library (GLU) offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; 
checking for the presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which 
follow the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing piecewise 
linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives (including, but not limited 
to, teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting up projection matrices and 
unprojecting screen coordinates to world coordinates. . X.Org maintains its own 
version of the Mesa libraries; see the xlibmesa-gl package for further 
information. . This package was built using version 2 of the C++ ABI. </li>

 Description: Mesa OpenGL utility library (unstripped) 
[X.Org] This package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a 
debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding 
logic errors in programs using this library (or the library itself). The 
library is installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that 
directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be 
debugged is executed. . Non-programmers will likely have little use for this 
package. See the libglu1-xorg package for further information. </li>

 Description: User binaries for a GSM speech compressor Contains user binaries 
for libgsm, an implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard 
for full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual 
pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s. . GSM 06.10 
compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling rate, i.e. a frame rate 
of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility with typical UNIX applications, our 
implementation turns frames of 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames 
(1650 Bytes/s). The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable 
speaker recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable form 
(given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate). . The interfaces 
offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and a library API. 
Compression and decompression run faster than realtime on most SPARCstations. 
The implementation has been verified against the ETSI standard test patterns.

<li>Package: libmagick++9<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 
7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.10<br>
 Description: The object-oriented C++ API to the 
ImageMagick library Magick++ supports an object model which is inspired by 
PerlMagick. Magick++ executes faster than PerlMagick since it is accessed from 
a compiled language rather than from a scripting language. This makes it more 
suitable for Web CGI programs which must start-up and execute quickly. Images 
support implicit reference counting so that copy constructors and assignment 
incur almost no cost. The cost of actually copying an image (if necessary) is 
done just before modification and this copy is managed automatically by 
Magick++. De-referenced copies are automatically deleted. The image objects 
support value (rather than pointer) semantics so it is trivial to support 
multiple generations of an image in memory at one time. . Magick++ provides 
integrated support for STL. This support allows Magick++ to be used with the 
Standard Template Library (STL) so that the powerful containers available (e.g. 
deque, vector, list, and map) can be used to write programs similar to those 
possible with PERL &amp; PerlMagick. STL-compatible template versions of 
ImageMagick's list-style operations are provided so that operations may be 
performed on multiple images stored in STL containers. </li>

Description: Authentication abstraction library SASL is the Simple 
Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding authentication support 
to connection-based protocols. To use SASL, a protocol includes a command for 
identifying and authenticating a user to a server and for optionally 
negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is 
negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the 
connection. See RFC 2222 for more information. . This is the Cyrus SASL API 
implementation, version 2. . Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI 
(MIT Kerberos 5 or Heimdal Kerberos 5), KERBEROS_V4, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can 
be used. This package is unusable without the SASL plugins. Most likely you

<li>Package: libx11-6<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: X Window System protocol client library 
The libX11 library, also known as &quot;Xlib&quot;, provides a means of 
communicating with an X server via the X protocol. . Xlib provides low-level 
functionality, dealing mostly with the wire protocol and in terms of basic 
operations such as opening and closing the connection to the X server, creating 
graphics contexts, drawing graphics primitives such as lines, arcs, and glyphs, 
handling events, and so forth. A set of dynamically-loadable 
internationalization modules is also part of this package, though not in the 
libX11 shared object itself. . Application programmers who are new to the X 
Window System will likely find one of the many &quot;Toolkit&quot; libraries 
far more convenient to program against than Xlib directly. Examples of popular 
toolkit libraries are GTK+, Qt, XForms, LessTif, and Athena. . libx11-6 depends 
on xlibs-data for locale data and the X error and keysym databases. </li>

 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: X Window System protocol client library 
(unstripped) This package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in 
a debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding 
logic errors in programs using this library (or the library itself). The 
library is installed in /usr/X11R6/lib/debug and can be used by placing that 
directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be 
debugged is executed. . Unstripped versions of Xlib's loadable modules for 
internationalization support are provided in 
/usr/X11R6/lib/debug/X11/locale/lib/common. Note that if you wish to debug 
these modules, you will need to set XLOCALEDIR to 
/usr/X11R6/lib/debug/X11/locale. Also note that for security reasons, 
unprivileged users are unable to override XLOCALEDIR in this way, so you may 
have to perform your debugging of the Xlib modules as root. . Non-programmers 
will likely have little use for this package. See the libx11-6 package for 
further information. </li>

(&quot;Xlib&quot;) are provided by this package. . See the libx11-6 package for 
further information. . Ideally, this package would not depend on any extension 
headers, as Xlib is designed to implement only the core X protocol. 
Nevertheless, some parts of Xlib have acquired references to extension headers 
over the years. Specifically, header files for the BIG-REQUESTS, XKEYBOARD, 
XInputExtension, and XC-MISC extensions are used internally. These dependencies 
are not exposed via Xlib's own external interfaces. </li>

miscellaneous utility library libXmuu is a very small set of miscellaneous 
utility functions extracted from Xmu, Xt, and Xaw. This library is intended for 
X clients that need the occasional useful function from these libraries but do 
not require the toolkit overhead. To use libXmuu, simply include the headers 
for the other libraries in the client and link against Xmuu instead of Xmu, Xt, 
and Xaw. Needless to say, if the client uses functions from Xmu, Xt, or Xaw 
that are not present in Xmuu, it will fail to link. </li>

This meta package is used as a build dependency of Debian linux-image packages 
to prevent a version discrepancy between the linux-image and corresponding 
linux-sources packages in the fast-moving unstable archive. The package's 
dependency relations are structured so that a linux-image package's build 
dependencies can always be satisfied, even if the linux-source package that had 
been used to compile the image has been superseeded by a newer Debian revision 
since the last build. . The package provides a list of virtual packages, 
corresponding to Debian revisions of a linux-source package. The Debian 
linux-patch contains the information needed to roll back the current 
linux-source to any of the revisions identified by the provided virtual 
packages. Therefore, the linux-tree package ensures the availability of the 
Linux kernel source tree corresponding to each of the virtual packages listed.

implementation of all modules of version 3.1 of the Linux Standard Base for 
Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64 (Itanium), IBM S390, and PowerPC 32-bit 
architectures with the Linux kernel. Future revisions of the specification and 
this package may support the LSB on additional architectures and kernels. . The 
intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way of installing 
and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux. Its presence does not imply that 
we believe that Debian fully complies with the Linux Standard Base, and should 
not be construed as a statement that Debian is LSB-compliant. </li>

Description: network-wide graphing framework (grapher/gatherer) Munin is a 
highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of virtually 
everything imaginable throughout your network, while still maintaining a 
rattling ease of installation and configuration. . This package contains the 
grapher/gatherer. You will only need one instance of it in your network. It 
will periodically poll all the nodes in your network it's aware of for data, 
which it in turn will use to create graphs and HTML pages, suitable for viewing 
with your graphical web browser of choice. . It is also able to alert you if 
any value is outside of a preset boundary, useful if you want to be alerted if 
a filesystem is about to grow full, for instance. You can do this by making 
Munin run an arbitrary command when you need to be alert it, or make use of the 
intrinsic Nagios support. . Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on 
Tobi Oetiker's excellent RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, 
take a peek at &lt;http://www.linpro.no/projects/munin/example/&gt;. </li>

throughout your network, while still maintaining a rattling ease of 
installation and configuration. . This package contains the daemon for the 
nodes being monitored. You should install it on all the nodes in your network. 
It will know how to extract all sorts of data from the node it runs on, and 
will wait for the gatherer to request this data for further processing. . It 
includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such as cpu 
usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your own plugins which 
are capable of extracting other system-specific values is very easy, and is 
often done in a matter of minutes. You can also create plugins which relay 
information from other devices in your network that can't run Munin, such as a 
switch or a server running another operating system, by using SNMP or similar 
technology. . Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's

 Version: 3.09.2-7~1<br>
 
Description: ML language implementation with a class-based object system 
Objective Caml is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light 
dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful 
module system in the style of Standard ML. . Objective Caml comprises two 
compilers. One generates bytecode which is then interpreted by a C program. 
This compiler runs quickly, generates compact code with moderate memory 
requirements, and is portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. 
Performance of generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation: 
almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used either as a 
standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone programs, or as an 
interactive, toplevel-based system. . The other compiler generates 
high-performance native code for a number of processors. Compilation takes 
longer and generates bigger code, but the generated programs deliver excellent 
performance, while retaining the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode 
compiler. It is not available on all arches though. . This package contains 
everything needed to develop ocaml applications, including the graphics 
libraries. </li>

<li>Package: powertop<br>
 Architecture: i386<br>
 Version: 1.7~svn-r227-2~1
<br>  Description: linux tool to find out what is using power on a laptop 
PowerTOP is a Linux tool that finds the software component(s) that make your 
laptop use more power than necessary while it is idle. As of Linux kernel 
version 2.6.21, the kernel no longer has a fixed 1000Hz timer tick. This will 
(in theory) give a huge power savings because the CPU stays in low power mode 
for longer periods of time during system idle. . However... there are many 
things that can ruin the party, both inside the kernel and in userspace. 
PowerTOP combines various sources of information from the kernel into one 
convenient screen so that you can see how well your system is doing, and which 
components are the biggest problem. . Homepage: http://www.linuxpowertop.org/

<li>Package: python-pysqlite2<br>
 Architecture: all<br>
 Version: 2.3.2-0bpo1

2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite. . This package is built against 
SQLite 3. For an interface to SQLite 2, see the package python-sqlite. An 
alternative Python SQLite 3 module is packaged as python-apsw. . SQLite is a 
relational database management system contained in a relatively small C 
library. It is a public domain project created by D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the 
usual client-server paradigm, the SQLite engine is not a standalone process 
with which the program communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an 
integral part of the program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard, 
including transactions, triggers and most of complex queries. . pysqlite makes 
this powerful embedded SQL engine available to Python programmers. It stays 
compatible with the Python database API specification 2.0 as much as possible, 
but also exposes most of SQLite's native API, so that it is for example 
possible to create user-defined SQL functions and aggregates in Python. . If 
you need a relational database for your applications, or even small tools or 
helper scripts, pysqlite is often a good fit. It's easy to use, easy to deploy, 
and does not depend on any other Python libraries or platform libraries, except 
SQLite. SQLite itself is ported to most platforms you'd ever care about. . It's 
often a good alternative to MySQL, the Microsoft JET engine or the MSDE, 
without having any of their license and deployment issues. . This package is an 
empty dummy package that always depends on a package built for Debian's default 
Python version. </li>

 Description: python interface to SQLite 3 pysqlite is a DB-API 
2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite. . This package is built against 
SQLite 3. For an interface to SQLite 2, see the package python-sqlite. An 
alternative Python SQLite 3 module is packaged as python-apsw. . SQLite is a 
relational database management system contained in a relatively small C 
library. It is a public domain project created by D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the 
usual client-server paradigm, the SQLite engine is not a standalone process 
with which the program communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an 
integral part of the program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard, 
including transactions, triggers and most of complex queries. . pysqlite makes 
this powerful embedded SQL engine available to Python programmers. It stays 
compatible with the Python database API specification 2.0 as much as possible, 
but also exposes most of SQLite's native API, so that it is for example 
possible to create user-defined SQL functions and aggregates in Python. . If 
you need a relational database for your applications, or even small tools or 
helper scripts, pysqlite is often a good fit. It's easy to use, easy to deploy, 
and does not depend on any other Python libraries or platform libraries, except 
SQLite. SQLite itself is ported to most platforms you'd ever care about. . It's 
often a good alternative to MySQL, the Microsoft JET engine or the MSDE, 
without having any of their license and deployment issues. . This package is 
built for Python 2.3. </li>

Subversion (aka. svn) Subversion is a version control system much like the 
Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Version control systems allow many 
individuals (who may be distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of 
files (typically source code). Subversion has all the major features of CVS, 
plus certain new features that CVS users often wish they had. . These modules 
are required to interface with Subversion from Python. This would be useful if 
you wanted to, for example, write a Python script that manipulates a subversion 
repository or working copy. . Homepage: http://subversion.tigris.org </li>

<li>Package: quilt<br>
 Architecture: all<br>
 Version: 0.45-3~bpo.1<br>
 
Description: Tool to work with series of patches Quilt manages a series of 
patches by keeping track of the changes each of them makes. They are logically 
organized as a stack, and you can apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by 
traveling into the stack (push/pop). . Quilt is good for managing additional 
patches applied to a package received as a tarball or maintained in another 
version control system. The stacked organization is proven to be efficient for 
the management of very large patch sets (more than hundred patches). As matter 
of fact, it was designed by and for linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from 
the -mm branch, is the original author), and its main use by the current 
upstream maintainer is to manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel 
made for the SUSE distribution. . This package completely integrates into the 
CDBS, allowing maintainers using this new paradigm for their packaging scripts 
to benefit from the comfort of quilt when editing their diff against upstream. 
The package also provides some basic support those not using CDBS. . 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt is the current best approximation of 
an upstream homepage. </li>

 Version: 1.2.9-15<br>
 Description: virtual network computing server software VNC stands for Virtual 
Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote display system which allows you 
to view a computing `desktop' environment not only on the machine where it is 
running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine 
architectures. . This package provides a server to which X clients can connect 
and the server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer. . The 
difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the data 
encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not support 
jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of vncserver 
(&gt; 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally good as 
the tightvnc encoding. . Note: This server does not support or need a display. 
You need a vncviewer to see something. However, this viewer may also be on a 
computer running other operating systems in the local net. </li>

Vservers can be used to securely partition resources such as processes, memory, 
network; logically separate services or run entirely different distributions 
all on a single system. Virtual private servers are separated from each other 
through security contexts, and as a result are completely unaware of each 
other, or of the host itself. . http://linux-vserver.org/

are converted to plain text.) . This package provides the following programs: . 
* wvWare: Converts to HTML and LaTeX. It's used by a small army of helper 
scripts able to preview Word documents and convert them to various other 
formats, like PostScript, PDF, DVI, etc. . * wvRTF: Converts to Microsoft's 
Rich Text Format. . * wvSummary: Displays the summary information stream of all 
OLE2 files, i.e. Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, Access, etc. . * wvVersion: Outputs 
the version of the Word format a document is stored in. . Note that conversion 
to DVI, PostScript, or PDF requires the tetex-extra package; PDF conversion 
also requires Ghostscript. Having ELinks, Links, or Lynx will greatly improve 
the plain text output. ImageMagick may help with the quality of images. If you 
wish to preview Word documents from the comfort of your mail reader, install a

metapackage provides the essential components for a standalone workstation 
running the X Window System. It provides the X libraries, an X server (except 
on the S/390 architecture), a set of fonts, and a group of basic X clients and 
utilities. . Higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, 
can depend on this package and simplify their dependencies. . It should be 
noted that a package providing x-window-manager and a package providing 
x-terminal-emulator should also be installed to ensure a comfortable X 
experience. </li> 
<li>Package: x-window-system-dev<br>
 Architecture: i386<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-1bpo1<br>

the X.Org Project which are most interesting to programmers. . X Window System 
design documentation, manual pages, library reference works, unstripped and 
static versions of the shared libraries, C header files, and special versions

<li>Package: x11-common<br>
 Architecture: all<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure 
x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further 
installation of the X Window System in any configuration. . Those wishing an X 
server only (with remote font services and clients) will also require the 
xserver-common package and an X server package (most likely xserver-xorg). . 
The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries, 
xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages, and likely many more 
client packages. . Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are 
fuzzy on the concepts of X servers and X clients) will require both of the 
above sets of packages. For convenience, the &quot;x-window-system&quot; 
metapackage will include everything that is required for a standalone X 
workstation. . A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, 
including &quot;X&quot;, &quot;X Version 11&quot;, &quot;X11&quot;, 
&quot;X11R6&quot;, and &quot;X11R6.8&quot;. The version of X used in Debian is 
derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and is thus often 
also referred to as &quot;X.Org&quot;. All of the preceding quoted terms are 
functionally interchangeable in an Debian system. . Until recently, Debian 
shipped an X implementation released by The XFree86 Project, Inc. (aka 
&quot;XFree86&quot;). The X.Org implementation is derived from the XFree86 
implementation previously shipped, and is generally considered to be the 
standard implementation by vendors and distributors. . Still confused? Install 
this package and then read the files in /usr/share/doc/x11-common/ for 
assistance. </li> 
<li>Package: xbase-clients<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: miscellaneous X clients An X client is a 
program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via the X libraries), 
and thus with some input and output hardware like a graphics card, monitor, 
keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse). . This package provides a 
miscellaneous assortment of several dozen X clients that ship with the X Window 
System, including: - startx and xinit, which initialize X sessions from the

of eyes track the pointer; - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a 
given X font; - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts; - xhost, a 
very dangerous program that you should never use; - xkill, a tool for 
terminating misbehaving X clients; - xload, a monitor for the system load 
average; - xlogo, a demo program that displays the X logo; - xmag, which 
magnifies parts of the X screen; - xman, a manual page browser; - xmessage, a 
tool to display message or dialog boxes; - xrandr, a command-line interface to 
the RandR extension; - xrefresh, a tool that forces a redraw of the X screen; - 
xsetroot, a tool for tailoring the appearance of the root window; - xtrapchar, 
xtrapin, xtrapinfo, xtrapout, xtrapproto, xtrapreset, and xtrapstats, a group 
of sample clients that use the XTrap extension; - xvidtune, a tool for 
customizing X server modelines for your monitor; - xwd, a utility for taking 
window dumps (&quot;screenshots&quot;) of the X session; - xwud, a viewer for 
window dumps created by xwd; - oclock and xclock, graphical clocks; -

manipulating ICE protocol authorization records; - xset, a tool for setting 
miscellaneous X server parameters; - xmodmap, a utility for modifying keymaps 
and pointer button mappings in X; - xsetmode and xsetpointer, tools for 
handling X Input devices; - setxkbmap, xkbbell, xkbcomp, xkbevd, xkbprint, 
xkbvleds, and xkbwatch, tools for managing the X Keyboard Extension (XKB); - 
xsm, a session manager for X sessions; - smproxy, a session manager proxy for X 
clients that do not use the X session manager protocol; - xgamma, a tool for 
querying and setting a monitor's gamma correction; - appres, editres, listres, 
viewres, and xrdb, which query and update the X resource database; - Xmark, 
x11perf, and x11perfcomp, tools for benchmarking graphical operations under the 
X Window System; - fstobdf, which retrieves a font in BDF format from an X font 
server; - xcmsdb, a device color characteristic utility for the X Color 
Management System; - xstdcmap, a utility to selectively define standard 
colormap properties; - xev, an X event displayer; - xfindproxy, a tool to 
locate X proxy services; - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X 
server; - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display; 
- xlsfonts, a server font list displayer; - xprop, a property displayer for X; 
- xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X; - xwininfo, a window 
information utility for X; - glxinfo, a GLX extension information utility for 
X; - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X; - ico, an X graphics 
demo using an animated polyhedron; - dga, a demo program for the DGA extension; 
and - xgc, an (unfinished) X graphics demo program. . xbase-clients also -- 
except on the s390 architecture -- contains the X.Org X server configuration 
programs xorgcfg and xorgconfig, but in general the Debconf interface to the 
xserver-xorg package should be used instead of these tools. . The bitmap, 
editres, viewres, xbiff, xcalc, xconsole, xditview, xedit, xf86cfg, xman, 
xsetroot, and xsm programs use bitmap images provided by the xlibs-data 
package. xkbcomp uses the XKEYBOARD (XKB) extension configuration data provided 
by the xlibs package. . (Strictly speaking, atobm does not depend on any X 
libraries, but it shares a manual page with bitmap and bmtoa, and so is grouped 
with them in this package.) . This package no longer provides the 'mkfontscale' 
program; it has instead been moved to xutils. </li> 
<li>Package: xdm<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4
<br>  Description: X display manager xdm manages a collection of X servers, 
which may be on the local host or remote machines. It provides services similar 
to those provided by init, getty, and login on character-based terminals: 
prompting for login name and password, authenticating the user, and running a 
session. xdm supports XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol) and can also 
be used to run a chooser process which presents the user with a menu of 
possible hosts that offer XDMCP display management. . If the xutils package is 
installed, xdm can use the sessreg utility to register login sessions to the 
system utmp file; this, however, is not necessary for xdm to function. . xdm 
requires the C preprocessor (cpp) to process its configuration files. The GNU C 
preprocessor's &quot;-traditional&quot; support misbehaves in early releases of 
the GCC 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions. </li>
<li>Package: xdmx<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4
<br>  Description: Distributed Multi-head X server Xdmx is a proxy X server 
that uses one or more other X servers as its display devices. It provides 
multi-head X functionality for displays that might be located on different 
machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server that acts as a proxy to a set 
of back-end X servers. All of the visible rendering is passed to the back-end X 
servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx front-end, and everything appears as it 
would in a regular multi-head configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with 
+xinerama on the command line), the clients see a single large screen. </li>

Version: 3.0.3-0-2~bpo1<br>
 Description: The Xen Hypervisor on i386 with pae 
The hypervisor is the &quot;core&quot; for XEN itself. It gets booted by the 
boot loader and controls cpu and memory, sharing them between your 
administrative domain (Domain 0) and the virtual guest systems. . This version 
of the hypervisor is built with PAE enabled, in order to support systems with 
more than 4GB of memory. If you have less than that you should probably choose 
the non -pae version. . In order to boot a XEN system along with this package 
you also need a kernel specifically crafted to work as the Domain 0, mediating 
hardware access for XEN itself. </li>

ability to serve locally installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it 
possible to offload that job from the X server, and/or have a central 
repository of fonts on a networked machine running xfs so that all the machines 
running X servers on a network do not require their own set of fonts. xfs may 
also be invoked by users to, for instance, make available X fonts in user 
accounts that are not available to the X server or to an already running system 
xfs. </li>

forward X traffic across the firewall. Used in conjunction with the X server 
Security extension and authorization checking, xfwp constitutes a safe, simple, 
and reliable mechanism both to hide the addresses of X servers located on an 
intranet and to enforce a server connection policy. Xfwp cannot protect against 
mischief originating on an intranet; however, when properly configured it can 
guarantee that only trusted clients originating on authorized external Internet 
hosts will be allowed inbound access to local X servers. </li>

plugin is a merge between aac and mp4 plugin. so now you could read all new and 
old files encoded with different encoder and different format (for the aac 
part). This is possible since the libfaad2 allow to read old aac ADTS format.

<li>Package: xnest<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4
<br>  Description: nested X server Xnest is an X server that is itself an X 
client. This allows you to run a server within a server; this is occasionally 
useful for testing new window managers and other X clients. . Xnest relies upon 
its parent X server for font services. </li> 
<li>Package: xserver-common<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: files and utilities common to all X 
servers The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System. Its job 
is to communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a 
standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based 
programs). The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care 
about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such things 
as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many buttons the 
mouse has, etc.). The catch is that the X server must itself know the technical 
specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the keyboard layout, the 
protocol used by the mouse, and so forth. . X servers either need fonts 
installed on the local host, or need to know of a remote host that provides 
font services (with xfs, for instance). The former means that font packages are 
mandatory. The latter means that font packages may be gratuitous. To err on the 
side of caution, install at least the xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or 
xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages. </li> 
<li>Package: xserver-xfree86<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: transitional package for moving from 
xfree86 to X.Org This package smooths upgrades from Debian 3.1 by depending on 
xserver-xorg. </li> 
<li>Package: xserver-xorg<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 
6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4<br>
 Description: the X.Org X server The X.Org X server is 
an X server for several architectures and operating systems, which is derived 
from the XFree86 4.x series of X servers. . The X.Org server supports most 
modern graphics hardware from most vendors, and supersedes all XFree86 X 
servers. . If the discover, mdetect, laptop-detect and xresprobe packages are 
installed, this package's configuration script will use them to attempt 
automatic configuration of the X server based on your information returned by 
your video card, mouse, and monitor. . This package suggests the libglide2 
package, which is necessary for the X.Org X server's &quot;glide&quot; video 
driver to work with 3Dfx Interactive's Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 cards. Users 
of other video cards need not install libglide2. </li>

<li>Package: xsupplicant<br>
 Architecture: i386<br>
 Version: 1.2pre1-1<br>
 
Description: 802.1x supplicant (client) This software allows a workstation to 
authenticate with a RADIUS server using 802.1x and the EAP protocol. It can be 
used for computers with wired or wireless LAN connections to complete a strong 
authentication before joining the network and supports the dynamic assignment 
of WEP keys. . Homepage: http://open1x.org </li> 
<li>Package: xtightvncviewer<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 1.2.9-15
<br>  Description: virtual network computing client software for X VNC stands 
for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote display system which 
allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment not only on the machine 
where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety 
of machine architectures. . It is implemented in a client/server model. This 
package provides a client for X, with this you can connect to a vncserver 
somewhere in the network and display its content in a window. There are 
vncserver available for X and for Win95/NT. . The difference between the 
xtightvncviewer and the normal vncviewer is the data encoding, optimized for 
low bandwidth connections. If the client do not support jpeg or zlib encoding 
it can use the default one. Later versions of xvncviewer (&gt; 3.3.3r2) support 
a new automatic encoding that should be equally good as the tightvnc encoding. 
</li> 
<li>Package: xutils<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4
<br>  Description: X Window System utility programs xutils provides a set of 
utility programs shipped with the X Window System that do not require the X 
libraries; many of these programs are useful even on a system that does not 
have any X clients or X servers installed. . The programs in this package 
include: - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts; - bdftruncate and 
ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings from ISO 10646-encoded 
fonts - ccmakedep, a version of makedepend which &quot;does it right&quot; - 
cleanlinks, a program to remove dangling symlinks and empty directories from a 
shadow link tree (created with lndir) - fslsfonts, a tool that lists fonts 
served by an X font server; - imake, a C preprocessor interface to the make 
utility; - lndir, a tool that creates a shadow directory of symbolic links to 
another directory tree; - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary 
application and a UTF-8 terminal emulator; - makedepend, a tool to create 
dependencies in makefiles; - makeg, a tool for making debuggable executables; - 
makepsres, a tool that creates PostScript language resource database files; - 
makestrs, a tool that makes string table C source and header(s); - mkcfm, a 
tool that create summaries of font metric files in CID font directories; - 
mkdirhier, a tool that creates a directory hierarchy; - mkfontdir, a program to 
generate fonts.dir files; - scanpci, a utility for retrieving information about 
the PCI bus and devices on it (not available on all architectures); - pcitweak, 
a utility that can be used to examine or change registers in the PCI 
configuration space (not available on all architectures); - pswrap, a tool that 
creates C procedures from segments of PostScript language code; - revpath, 
which generates a relative path that can be used to undo a change-directory; - 
rstart, a remote start client; - rstartd, a remote start daemon activated by 
rstart connections; - sessreg, a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries; 
- showfont, a font dumper for use with an X font server; - showrgb, a 
decompiler for RGB color-name databases; - xfsinfo, an X font server 
information utility; - xmkmf, a tool that creates a Makefile from an Imakefile; 
and - xon, a tool that starts an X program on a remote machine. . Installation 
of an rsh or ssh daemon (server) is necessary if rstartd is to be used, and 
installation of an rsh or ssh client is necessary if rstart is to be used. The 
luit program requires locale information from the xlibs-data package. . imake 
uses the C preprocessor (cpp) as a macro processor. The GNU C preprocessor's 
&quot;-traditional&quot; support misbehaves in early releases of the GCC 3.3 
series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions. </li> 
<li>Package: xvfb<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 6.9.0.dfsg.1-6~bpo.4
<br>  Description: virtual framebuffer X server Xvfb provides an X server that 
can run on machines with no display hardware and no physical input devices. It 
emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual memory. The primary use of this 
server was intended to be server testing, but other novel uses for it have been 
found, including testing clients against unusual depths and screen 
configurations, doing batch processing with Xvfb as a background rendering 
engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the X server to a new platform, and 
providing an unobtrusive way to run applications that don't really need an X 
server but insist on having one anyway. . This package also contains a 
convenience script called xvfb-run which simplifies the automated execution of 
X clients in a virtual server environment. This convenience script requires the 
use of the xauth program from xbase-clients, hence the suggestion of 
xbase-clients. </li> 
<li>Package: yaird<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 0.0.12-17~1<br>
 
Description: Yet Another mkInitRD Yaird generates initial boot images in 
initramfs format. The boot image is an intermediate step between the boot 
loader (eg Grub, Lilo) and the init scripts on the root file system; it loads 
modules and enables devices to a level where the kernel can access the real 
root file system, and then hands over control to the init scripts. . Compared 
with earlier implementations like mkinitrd, it does a better job of deciding 
which modules are needed for your system, so it produces smaller images and 
there is less risk of making an image that will not boot. This comes at a 
price: only Linux 2.6 is supported (because 2.6 has sysfs, which makes it a lot 
easier to do a hardware inventory). . See mkinitrd.yaird(8) for how to activate 
the program. . See http://wiki.debian.org/InitrdReplacementOptions for status 
and comparison with other ramdisk tools. . Homepage:

<li>Package: yasm<br>
 Architecture: amd64<br>
 Version: 0.4.0-3.1<br>
 
Description: modular assembler with multiple syntaxes support Yasm is a 
complete rewrite of the NASM assembler. It supports multiple assembler syntaxes 
(eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object formats 
(binary objects, COFF, Win32, ELF32, ELF64) and even multiple instruction sets 
(including AMD64). It also has an optimiser module. </li> </ul>  Not affiliated
