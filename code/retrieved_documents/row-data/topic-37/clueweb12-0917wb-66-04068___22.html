<p><b>Metaverse Roadmap Foresight Framework</b></p> 
<p>Inputs were solicited in <strong>four topic areas</strong>: I. Industry 
Conditions, II. Forecasts, III. Issues and Questions, and IV. Problems and 
Indicators. These were divided into<strong>nineteen</strong> <strong>categories
</strong>, from History to Progress Indicators. Each was also considered in 
<strong>three subcategories</strong>: A. Technology and Science, B. Business 
and Economics, or C. Social, Legal and Other domains. This is an adaptation of 
the<strong>Foresight Framework Model</strong> of Dr. Peter Bishop, chair of the 
Futures Studies masters program at the University of Houston.</p> 
<p>Foresight frameworks <strong>call forth a broad set of future-relevant 
information</strong>, but do not fully address any category. For each input, 
category and subcategory assignments are arbitrary and arguable. Some 
contradict each other due to controversy, uncertainty, and the breadth of 
community perspective. Some original quotes remain, but most have been edited 
and interpreted by ASF staff in subsequent research.<strong>We apologize for 
any mistakes or misrepresentations, and hope you enjoy this rich source of 
community insight relevant to the future of the 3D-enabled web.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. History.</strong> Relevant facts in the history of metaverse 
development.</p> 
<p><strong>1A. History - Technology and Science</strong></p> &bull; In 1967 the
Canadian Geographic Information Systems came online. This was the world's first 
operational computerized geographic information system (GIS), built by Roger 
Tomlinson at the Canadian Department of Energy, Mines and Resources. a <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1977, theApple II microcomputer (followed by the IBM PC in 1981) 
launched the mass market home computing revolution. b <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1978, 
the first &quot;1D&quot; (text-based) chat world,MUD (Multi-User 
Dungeon/Domain), by Essex University's Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle, 
emerged. It spawned a decade of increasingly popular text-based virtual 
communities run on servers. Also during this year, Scott Adams created
Adventureland, the first text-based themed virtual world for home computers. 
Also in 1978, Ward Christensen createdCBBS, the first privately operated BBS 
(phone in community) in Chicago, IL. BBSs were run by system operators 
(&quot;SysOps&quot;) and added a new level of decentralization to virtual 
community. c <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1984, the Apple Macintosh became the first 
commercially successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface 
(GUI) and mouse instead of the then-standard command line interface. This 
metaphor, copied by the Microsoft Windows operating system in 1985, opened up 
the computer screen as a visual portal to cyberspace in an intuitive point and 
click metaphor. d <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1987, the first 2D chat world, or 
&quot;graphical MUD,&quot;Habitat, by Lucasfilm's Chip Morningstar and Randy 
Farmer, was launched. Habitat was the first successful attempt at a large-scale 
commercial 2D virtual community. In Habitat the user was represented as anavatar
, a term coined by Chip Morningstar from the Sanscrit avatara (incarnation of a 
higher being). e <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1993, Mosaic became the first widely 
distributed web browser (multimedia graphical user interface), to run on the 
Windows operating system. It opened the Internet's burgeoning wealth of 
distributed information services (websites, databases, etc.) to the general 
public and began the modern Web era. f <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1994, beginning in 
Japan, hardware-accelerated 3D and dedicated graphics/polygon processors began 
appearing in console games like the Sega Saturn andSony PlayStation (1994 
Japan, 1995 U.S.), and Nintendo&rsquo;s cartridge based Nintendo 64 (1996). 
This hardware advance enabled us to move from planar 2D worlds and 2.5D sprites 
to true 3D games. g <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1994, Dave Gobel spun Knowledge 
Adventure Worlds (renamedWorlds Inc. in 1995) out of Knowledge Adventure to 
create fully navigable 3D virtual worlds for global users of the internet. In 
1994 KAW created the worlds first avatar-based 3D chat (Worlds Chat). In 1995 
Gobel madeStarbright World, the first broadband virtual world and one of the 
first VW therapy applications, to help hospitalized children overcome their 
isolation. This same year Ron Brivitch and others at KAW developed an internal 
project called AlphaWorld, which included limited property rights, multi-user 
peer-to-peer construction tools, drag and drop objects that appear to all users 
simultaneously, teleportation, user-authored worlds, and AI-based bots. 
AlphaWorld becameActive Worlds in 1996. The first users immigrated into 
AlphaWorld on June 28, 1995. The public 3D metaverse begins. h <br>
<br>
&bull; 
In 1996, Nintendo&rsquo;s,Super Mario 64 introduced a new era for the 3D 
platform game genre, allowing players to creatively explore and interact with a 
virtual world in three dimensions without restriction. This year also saw the 
first 3D MORPG (multiplayer online role-playing game)Meridian 59, by Archetype 
Interactive. Though simple, this player vs. player (PvP) combat game enjoys a 
small, loyal subscription base even today. In this same year multiplayer online 
role-playing games (MORPGs) gain the technical ability to expand player numbers 
beyond small groups (8-16) to very large player numbers (3,000+). Massively 
multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs, &quot;mor-peg's&quot;) and all 
their social complexities, emerged. i <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1997, Ultima Online 
(UO) became the first 3D MMORPG. Ultima saw peak subscribers of 250,000 in July 
of 2003. Still has 150,000 subscribers in June 2005. Also in 1997, Electric 
Communities beta tested the fully distributed virtual world platform EC 
Habitats. WorldsAway and The Palace were two other early persistent worlds that 
debuted as technical innovations but business failures during this time. As
Randy Farmer notes, persistent virtual worlds without an obvious role playing 
goal require significantly more initiative and creativity from their populace, 
and business models must expect them to be much slower to gain traction. j <br>

<br> &bull; In 1999, Nvidia introduced the GeForce 256, the first PC card built 
around a GPU (graphics processing unit) a microprocessor that brought parts of 
the geometry rendering pipeline into specialized silicon. Prior to this, all 3D 
cards for desktop PCs were simply aids to the CPU. [9] k <br>
<br>
&bull; In 
2003,Second Life debuted, the first 3D persistent virtual world that allows its 
users to retain property rights to the virtual objects they create in the 
online economy. After a period of low initial growth, by May 2006 Second Life 
has more than 230,000 downloads to date (paying no subscription fee) and a 
transaction volume (virtual GDP) of US $60M per year. By Nov 2006 these figures 
have jumped to 1.7M downloads and a $220M/year economy (marginal rate). Though 
Second Life has no overt goal unlike a role playing game, the culture and 
economy are now sophisticated and lucrative enough that common physical world 
goals of exploration, socialization, and commerce have become sufficiently 
rewarding &quot;in world&quot; for many users. By late 2004 it was clear to 
early observers that this was the first persistent world platform that had made 
it &quot;over the hump&quot; into sustainable exponential growth. While 
performance, interface, and technical issues persist, this version of the 
metaverse is both a business success and a great training ground for first 
generation virtual creativity. l <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2005, Google released 
Google Maps, a free web server GIS application that can be embedded on any 
website using the Google API. This same year it also released Google Earth, a 
free downloadable virtual earth simulation based on satellite imagery. m <br>

<br> &bull; In 2006, the Google API was updated to support geocoding, and 
Google SketchUp, a free professional 3D modelling program, was released. A 
SketchUp add-on allows the user to export their 3D model as a .kmz file into 
Google Earth, allowing accurate geo-referencing and accurate placement of those 
models in Google Earth. The era of public annotation of the planet begins. n 
<br> <br>

<p>&bull; In 2007, Second Life announced they would release their complex (and 
for newbies, difficult-to-use) VW viewer software to theopen source community 
for modification and customization. As CEO Philip Rosedale says, &quot;this 
extends the control Residents can have over the Second Life experience and 
allows a worldwide community to examine, validate and improve the 
software&rsquo;s sophistication and capabilities.&rdquo;&quot; The Second Life 
platform continues to accelerate in membership. When we first began tracking 
it, accounts doubled from 160,000 to 330,000 accounts in four months (March to 
July 2006). Secondary to massive recent media exposure, the last three 
doublings have occurred an average of every two months, to 2.5 million accounts 
by Jan 2007. Over US $1M in transactions occur daily, on average, &quot;in 
world.&quot;</p> o <br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>1B. History - Business and Economics</strong></p> &bull; In 1994, 
theOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGS) was formed, with eight charter members. OGS 
was the first private sector organization of companies, government agencies and 
universities chartered to develop public interface specifications to geo-enable 
the web. Now with over 310 member organizations. a <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1997, 
users of MMOGs began treating inworld game items as assets that could be 
exchanged for real world economic value. Monetary exchanges of player accounts 
and the promise to provide game items to players in world, began on the new 
online action websiteeBay (named in Sept 1997). b <br>
<br>
&bull; By the early 
2000's, the cost of creating popular MMOGs numbered in the millions per project.
c <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2001, the economist Edward Castronova published the first 
online paper analyzing the impact of virtual economies. He notes that the GDP 
per capita in EverQuest's Norrath, the most popular synthetic world for U.S. 
players at the time, was four times higher than that of India and China[3]. d 
<br> <br>
&bull; In 2002, Project Entropia (now Entropia Universe) launches as 
the first virtual world where virtual currency can be exchanged for US dollars. 
It was also the first synthetic world seeking to attract the advertisement of 
real world services within the game world. [1] e <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2005, 
virtual worlds commerce was estimated at $30M in the US and $100M globally. The 
number of online worlds was doubling roughly every two years, consistent with
Moore's law [1]. f <br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>1C. History - Social, Legal and Other</strong></p> &bull; In 1981, 
Vernor Vinge published<em>True Names</em>, perhaps the earliest story to 
present a fully developed concept of cyberspace as an alternate world. a <br>

<br> &bull; In 1982, William Gibson coined the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; in 
his novelette,<em>Burning Chrome</em>. The &quot;cyberpunk&quot; genre of 
science fiction emerges. b <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1985, the term &quot;avatar&quot;
 is introduced as the goal of the computer game Ultima IV (the winner becomes 
&quot;the avatar&quot;). In later Ultima releases and in the online virtual 
world Habitat (1987) the avatar is the players on-screen visual persona. c <br>

<br> &bull; In 1992, Neal Stephenson, in his science fiction novel <em>Snow 
Crash</em>, coined the term &quot;metaverse&quot; for immersive 3D online 
worlds, and also popularized the term &quot;avatar&quot; for 3D simulations 
representing the user. Coinciding with the emergence of the world wide web,<em>
Snow Crash</em> helped many early web users to begin to perceive the 
&quot;space behind their screens&quot; as nothing less than a fundamental new 
informational dimension to physical space. d <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1995, software 
developer Bruce Damer (author of<em>Avatars! Exploring and Building Virtual 
Worlds on the Internet</em>, 1998), anthropologist Jim Funaro, and science 
fiction writer Keith Ferrel started theContact Consortium, a network to serve 
as a catalyst and forum for the emerging medium of multi-user virtual worlds 
and virtual communities in cyberspace. e <br>
<br>
&bull; In 1997, Doug 
Crockford wrote but did not publish&quot;Living Worlds Considered Harmful&quot;
, a critique of the VRML web-based virtual reality community, which prioritized 
3D graphics and standards over enabling &quot;socialization&quot; (the 
development of social communities within worlds). Adoption of VRML, an early 
attempt at metaverse 1.0, ceases shortly afterward. Crockford published this 
essay for historical value in conjunction with the Metaverse Roadmap Summit 
2006. f <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2004, according to the Entertainment Software 
Association: [7]<br>
 &nbsp; - more than 50% of the US population over the age 
of 6 plays video or computer games at least occasionally.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- 43 
percent of game players are women.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- 97 percent of games are 
purchased by adults over the age of 18<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- 60 percent of parents 
play games with their children at least once a month<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- the 
average game player is 29 years of age. g <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2004, Marvel 
Comics sued NCSoft, publisher ofCity of Heroes (CoH), the first major MMOG 
based on the superhero comic action genre. Their suit alleges CoH's powerful 
character creation and modification system only allows, but actively promotes 
the creation of characters whose copyrights and trademarks are owned by Marvel. 
The suit is settled for undisclosed terms in 2005, and the issue of physical 
world intellectual property infringement by players in virtual worlds becomes 
increasingly important. h <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2005, in Korea, successful 
lawsuits have been conducted against game providers by those who have lost 
their virtual items due to game-server insecurities [1]. i <br>

<p><strong>2. Current Conditions.</strong> Important current conditions in the 
metaverse industry.</p> 
<p><strong>2A. Current Conditions - Technology and Science</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; Web 2.0 (Participatory Web) technologies, led by innovative social 
networks, browsers, and search platforms, are accelerating the use of 3D and 
other rich media. The Participatory Web is tools and platforms that empower the 
user to tag, blog, comment, modify, augment, select from, rank, and talk back 
to the contributions of other users and the world community. Reputation-based 
public wikis, likeWikipedia, are pioneering examples of participatory web 
technology. Open APIs for tagging the web and tying it to the world, likeGoogle 
Maps, are another. Rich media-enabled social networking sites like MySpace are 
another. Another is the open sourceFlock web browser, which encourages RSS 
aggregation, automated blog posting, photo sharing, gathering and indexing of 
web searches, and other participatory technologies. In Japan, companies like
GaiaX have built social networking websites that allow their users, as one of 
many community options, to invite each other to online games and virtual 
worlds. This makes the social network the hub and the virtual worlds the 
occasional immersive experience [16]. Today's browsers are just beginning to 
manage 3D web capabilities (3D graphics, games, and video).Opera 9, for 
example, includes &quot;widgets&quot; that make it easy for users to organize 
their online games. The ability to easily incorporateYouTube and other video in 
leading social networking sites has really improved the stickiness of online 
community. Nevertheless, there is much to be done. We are very early in 
collaborative productivity software, likeWritely (Google's online word 
processor). We don't have robust data interchange, rich annotation (video, 
etc.), or conversational search. We don't have good security, privacy, 
identity, or reputation. We don't have worldwide ultra-broadband or wireless 
connectivity, which greatly limits efficiency and scope of the collaboration 
space. Within 3D spaces, we don't have easy access to professional digital 
modelling tools, or grid computing for data rich simulations. There is a lot to 
be done, this is a very incomplete list.</p> a <br>
<br>
&bull; Internet 
penetration in the US homes in 2006: 42% of Americans have broadband at home. 
71% of &quot;active users&quot; (those going online at least once a month) have 
broadband, and over 85% have dialup or better. 35% of all internet users post 
content to the web. [14]. According toNielsen/NetRatings, less than half of all 
Americans (142 million of 295 million total) were active internet users in 
2004. Countries wth better quality and more ubiquitous broadband, like Korea, 
are likely to have significantly higher percentages. b <br>
<br>
&bull; 
Software and story are today the prime indicators of success in online virtual 
worlds. Hardware (speed, graphical realism) and interface intutiveness remain 
important, but they are not the primary drivers of game success, as originally 
envisioned by virtual reality pioneers. Hardware and interface may be more 
negative factors, limiting the size of the market rather than driving 
differential success among offerings, at least in more mature markets. In the 
history of the video game industry, market share consistently accrues to 
stories that mentally and emotionally engage the user and are accessible by 
simple interfaces. Even virtual worlds likeSecond Life, which have deficits in 
graphical realism (several generations behind the state of the art), interface 
( a nonintuitive system requiring real dedication to learn to use) and 
traditional story (being entirely user-driven) nevertheless have a strong niche 
that caters to users desiring the freedom to create their own story, in a 
framework that encourages the marketing of their digital creations to other 
users. Even for proprietary platforms (consoles, portables), the quantity and 
quality of software titles remains the key market differentiator [1]. c <br>

<br> &bull; The dominant virtual world story to date is medieval fantasy. This 
is probably because our primary Western and Eastern cultural mythologies are 
fantasies and fables adapted from our distant past. Though we can expect a 
broader range of fiction and nonfiction worlds, medieval fantasy dominance may 
be very slow to change. d <br>
<br>
&bull; Pluralistic standards. There are 
many standards bodies:ISO, ANSI, W3C, etc. and many competing standards that 
find their own niches. As examples in the 3D Web space, Microsoft developed
Direct3D as a Windows-proprietary 3D graphics standard, and OpenGL (Open 
Graphics Library) has emerged as a competing open source standard. Direct3D 
currently leads OpenGL in video games (both have major share), but OpenGL has 
developed a clear lead for academic research and scientific visualization, as 
well as for non-Microsoft platforms. A range of open (Scalable Vector Graphics
), semi-open (Java) and proprietary (Adobe Flash, Microsoft's DirectX 10, MS 
Vista'sWindows Presentation Foundation, XAML, and Dassault and Microsoft's 3D 
XML) 3D web enhancement standards are in competition, and each has taken many 
years to develop. Many historical 3D web standards (VRML, Microsoft Chrome, 
Adobe Atmosphere, Shockwave 3D) failed to gain traction, while others (X3D, the 
VRML successor, adopted as an ISO standard in 2004) have had slow adoption 
rates and increasing competition from other open standards developed by 
proprietary groups (Microsoft's DirectX and XAML, Intel&rsquo;sUniversal 3D, 
others). e <br>
<br>
&bull; Independent developers and the open source 
community have not yet rallied around an open metaverse platform, as opposed to 
proprietary worlds.Croquet is a potential candidate, and the OpenSource 
Metaverse Project is another even more recent early effort, but to date none 
has received major support in developer time or funding from the volunteer 
community. f <br>
<br>
&bull; 3D desktop prototypes. Sun&rsquo;s Project 
Looking Glass, built on Java 3D, is an interesting but early attempt to enhance 
a primarily 2D desktop by incrementally adding fast and natural 3D 
functionality only where it makes the most sense. Looking Glass is a mostly 2D 
environment, but desktop objects become as manipulable as pieces of paper in 
the physical world, with windows, objects, and tabs that move, zoom, stack, and 
flip in a manner that conveys an appealing weight and physicality. Combined 
with intuitive mouse or touch gestures for object manipulation, such future 
desktops promise to greatly increase the ability to manipulate and manage 
information. Eliminating any signs of lag/processor overload for the 3D 
components, and developing entirely natural manipulation interfaces (possibly 
touch, verbal, or vision driven) are still significant barriers to be overcome. 
g <br>
<br>
&bull; 3D browser prototypes. Companies like 3<strong>B</strong>, 
Browse3D, and SphereSite have first generation 3D browsers available. 3B's is 
the most participatory, allowing users to pull in pages and graphics from sites 
like MySpace and Flicker to create a &quot;personalized 3D space&quot; for 
others to view, but doesn't yet include community or avatars. In general, the 
3D browser space presently fails to make a compelling case. We may need to see 
useful 3D desktops first, then an extension of this metaphor into collaborative 
3D space and virtual worlds. <br>
<br>
&bull; Location-based games (LBG) (also 
called &quot;locative games&quot;) for mobile phones are now emerging on 
GPS-equipped cell phones. In 2004,GloVentures demo game RayGun pushed current 
GPS technology &quot;to its limits,&quot; updating the players position once 
per second and making the player's &quot;next three steps matter.&quot; 
Mikioshi, a mobile online games leader, makesGunslingers 2 a combat-based cell 
phone LBG played in Asia.Mogi is virtual treasure game played with cellphones 
and mobile IM in France.Human Pac-Man was another concept game that demoed in 
Singapore in 2004, where the players used augmented reality goggles to capture 
pellets and run from ghosts, just like the 1980's video game. In 2005, Blister 
Entertainment launchedSwordfish and Torpedo Bay as the first US location-based 
GPS games. Asgeospatial tagging (geotagging or geocoding) begins to be added to 
these games, a collaborative game reality can emerge, directing game play. h 
<br> <br>
&bull; Creation of 3D worlds from 2D photos and video is now possible 
in rudimentary form.Mova's Contour is a system for live action volumetric 
performance capture in video, mapping the performance to 3D and eliminating 
much of the post-production work in 3D animation.ImageModeler by Realviz, 
available for all the major 3D animation packages, is another such professional 
tool (using 2D photos as input). GeoTango'sSilverEye is a similar product. MVR 
Summit quote: &quot;It's getting really easy to measure the world physically 
and recreate it using data acquisition. On this laptop computer my guys at U. 
Arkansas flew over the city, wrote a program, and four hours later had 3,000 
real life buildings virtualized with x, y, and z coordinates. That process is 
automated, so we can do that easier and easier with the demo files and high-res 
photos.&quot; i <br>
<br>
 &bull; AI agents continue to make major strides in 
computer animation.Massive Software, started as an AI project for massive 
simultaneous character animation for<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy 
(2001-2003), has developed a framework to provide each character a broad range 
of attributes and personality traits, and allow them to make independent 
decisions based on those traits and what they encounter in their virtual 
environment. In crowd scenes, these characters animate in a highly realistic 
fashion.<em>The Ant Bully</em> (2006) is the first U.S.-produced film to use 
the Massive crowd-based computer graphics, but a score of other films using 
Massive's system are in development. Nonplayer characters (NPCs) in virtual 
worlds also are making progress in autonomy and AI, but are several years away 
from the scale and sophistication seen in these feature films. j <br>
<br>

&bull; In 2005, roughly 600 million cell phones, 110 million desktop PCs, and 
60 million laptop PCs were being sold globally per year [66]. Cell phones are 
the most likely platform for mobile, augmented reality interaction with 
geospatial virtual worlds in coming years. k <br>
<br>
&bull; IPv6 and next 
generation internet (Internet2, etc.). In December 2003 the U.S. Dept. of 
Defense announced one of the first large-scale deployments of IPv6. Adoption of 
IPv6 since standardization has been slow, due to such factors as cost of 
conversion, operational conservatism, short term industry outlook, and 
difficulty of quantifying the cost of not converting in competitive markets 
[68]. IPv6&rsquo;s mandatory security, (authentication and non-repudiation), 
auto-configuration, multiple options for communication (unicast, multicast, 
broadcast, anycast), logical group indexing for addresses, and 128 bit address 
space (10^23 addresses per square meter of planet surface area) should be 
sufficient for all global embedded devices for the foreseeable future. In 2004 
the Chinese launchedCERNET2 [67] a competitor to Internet2 in the U.S. and an 
effort to become leaders of the next generation internet. IPv6 adoption will be 
an enabler of such 3D web advances as internet television and geospatial 
platforms, particularly in the longer run, once people are using a mobile 
geospatial web in five or more years. Likewise, next generation internet will 
bring HD videoconferencing, 3D television and other data-intensive services, 
possibly beyond the 10 year horizon for this roadmap. l <br>
<br>
&bull; Onset 
cues are used for realistic motion simulation in high-end simulators. In 
orienting to the world, the human body responds primarily to &quot;onset 
cues,&quot; inital rapid accelerations that signify a change in speed or 
direction. In combination with vision simulation, a number of virtual reality 
simulators (pilot trainers, combat trainers, etc.) use onset cues to provide 
kinesthetic feedback in highly immersive environments without requiring motion 
through space.Link's AH-64 Apache helicopter simulator, which requires a 
security clearance to operate, employs such such powerful onset cues that 
operators can get broken noses and bruises from the impact of virtual missiles, 
etc. Similar approaches are used in amusement park rides andsimulated racing. m 
<br> <br>

<p>&bull; Head mounted displays (HMDs) and Spatially Immersive Displays (SIDs) 
likeCAVE for virtual reality exist, but both technologies today are used only 
in niche markets. HMDs are likely to remain niche applications for the 
forseeable future (see Predictions, Tech and Science). There are many small HMD 
makers.eMagin makes a head-mounted, head-tracking 3D Visor with a 600 x 800p 
OLED display for immersive gaming for $600.Sensics uses the eMagin displays to 
make a very expensive panoramic HMD VR system with 2200 x 1200p per eye for

&bull; Physical Hyperlinks (Physical World 
Hyperlinks) are any machine readable identifier (1D and 2D barcodes, RFID tag, 
image, sound, fingerprint) that can be resolved by a cell phone to dial a phone 
number, start an email, or facilitate a direct Internet connection. In Japan 
today, 2D barcodes calledQR (&quot;Quick Response&quot;) codes, originally used 
for inventory management, are now proliferating on business cards, in magazine 
ads and product packaging. QR codes displayed on All Nippon Airways kiosks now 
allow cellphone users to travel with paperless electronic tickets. On 3G phones 
with good built-in cameras, even QR codes on billboards can be resolved by the 
camera phone, to play a movie trailer, provide a coupon code, etc. The current 
spec has an alphanumeric data capacity of 4,296 characters. A billboard QR code 
presently takes up significant space, but this space will certainly shrink as 
cell phone cameras and processors get better. See picture right, from &quot;New

<p><strong>2B. Current Conditions - Business and Economics</strong></p> &bull; 
Real-money trading (RMT) (also known as virtual asset trading), the purchase of 
virtual game items and virtual currency online, through such online enterprises 
asIGE, MOGS, and TEKGaming, is a major global annual business, with the 2005 
market size estimated at somewhere between$200 million and 1.5 billion [13]. 
Many virtual world currencies trade at rates higher than national currencies 
such as the Korean won and Chinese yen [1]. Besides blogosphere commentary on 
in-game activity, RMT is one of the few significant feedback systems today 
between events in the virtual and real world. Summit quote: &quot;There is the 
idea that what happens in the virtual can be tied to the real world. The 
reality is it's only happened a few times, real-money trade being one of these 
cross-over points. And it's not supposed to happen, it's actually against the 
rules in most MMOs.&quot; a <br>
<br>
&bull; Proliferation of internet video 
viewing platforms, and innovative video content distribution and revenue 
models. A number of companies have recently innovated serving video over the 
internet to large numbers of users, setting the stage for the emergence of 
true, network-independentinternet television (IPTV). Companies like YouTube (70 
million clips watched daily in July 2006),Google Video, Apple iTunes Video, 
iFilm, and MetaCafe are leading examples. Some are also innovating new 
downloading systems, like Metacafe, which allows regular users to download 
desired content to their hard drives automatically at night. Many are creating 
new digital rights management (DRM) systems for distribution of proprietary 
content. Apple iTunes Video allows viewing of reasonably priced content ($2 per 
network TV show) on computer or wearable video iPod. Google's revenue model is 
the most innovative, giving 70% of the revenues from paid video content to the 
content producer, allowing independent video producers to go direct-to-internet 
with a revenue model far better than they've ever had before. Google Video is 
also allowing the content producer to set the price, another first. Some of the 
free user-rated content is so interesting and tagged to user interests that it 
would, if downloaded to adigital video recorder (DVR) be preferable to watching 
regular television in the evening for some users. One can foresee a great 
platform for delivering specialized video content (machinima, tournaments, 
etc.) to game players and virtual world denizens just a few years hence. b <br>

<br> &bull; Chasing the long tail. A recent NYT article [49] noted that Netflix
, the online DVD rental service, with 5 million subscribers and 60,000 titles, 
has more than half (35-40K) of these titles rented out in any particular day. 
This suggests a strong appetite for the&quot;long tail&quot; [50] of 3D media 
content, at least among a subset of consumers, that is presently not being 
fulfilled by lowest common denominator Hollywood video productions, but is 
begining to be addressed by new media (Netflix, internet video) in an 
increasingly participatory culture. Netflix's movie recommendationcollaborative 
filtering system pushes consumers down the long tail of similar but more 
obscure fillms. It is so advanced that, like Amazon's, it is a competitive 
advantage. We can expect simiilar advances in recommendation systems for social 
communities within 3D worlds, as they proliferate. c <br>
<br>
&bull; Virtual 
prototyping (VP) is term from computer aided design (CAD), development, 
manufacturing, product lifecycle management (PLM), and quality assurance 
circles that involves simulation and testing of designs prior to manufacture. 
Most of this software is proprietary today, likeSimDesigner by MSC Software, and
Noesis PLM Optimization software, by Noesis Solutions, both built on the Catia 
V5 product development platform of product lifecycle management (PLM) software 
leader Dassault Systems. VP systems &quot;automate the exploration of the 
design space&quot;, allowing designers to try different materials and design 
parameters, rapidly simulating the physical and cost characteristics of the 
expected result. A few products designed in today's virtual worlds have already 
made the jump to the physical world.Tringo, a multiplayer game designed and 
played in Second Life, has been licensed for &quot;real world&quot; 
distribution on theGame Boy Advance in 2006. This has led some to forsee 
virtual worlds potential to become a low cost and low risk environment for 
prototyping physical products and architectures. But perhaps a more competitive 
future will be the ability to run professional CAD/CAM, architecture, PLM and 
other simulation software from within virtual worlds, as specialized creation 
environments for those with prototyping interests. d <br>
<br>
&bull; 3D worlds 
do not yet provide a useful work experience for most people, nor have enough 
features that integrate into people's nonvirtual lives. Summit quote: &quot;If 
I could go to these worlds and do something [useful] I'd be there everyday. But 
I'm not there just for the social activity. As soon as they bring in document 
creation or start being able to trade real things that have value outside the 
virtual environment I'm in.&quot; Seriosity may be the first company developing 
virtual worlds as online collaboration spaces and workspaces for virtual 
companies. They are in stealth mode in 2006. e <br>
<br>
&bull; Business models 
are emerging that allow humans to do piecework in cyberspace (and with gold 
farming, even in virtual worlds), and even to train simple AI programs.MTurk, 
Amazon's automated system for employing humans in contracts for simple online 
tasks, launched in beta in 2006. MTurk supports micropayments (e.g., a few 
pennies per task) and the monitoring of piecework performance via reputation.
Boxxet, a website and set of tools for generating community-ranked topical 
interest pages, launched in 2006. One of Boxxet's innovations is the use of 
human web users to train support vector AI machines to recognize valuable 
aggregated content. f <br>
<br>
&bull; Gold farmers are individuals who acquire 
in-game currency or objects by continually defeating enemies within online 
games. This &quot;gold&quot; is then sold to other players through third party 
RMT (real-money trade) websites. Many farmers work in less developed countries 
and sell online to affluent gamers in the more developed nations. ADec 2005 NYT 
article [15] estimated as many as 100 million people worldwide play interactive 
computer games on a monthly basis, that as many as 100,000 people in China 
(0.4% of Chinese gamers) are employed (self employed or in small businesses) as 
gold farmers. This latter number hasn't been independently verified. g <br>
<br>
&bull; In 2004, Internet penetration in China was still less than 6% of the 
urban population in 2004 [6], yet by that time China already had the single 
largest population of online gamers. This same year Chinese game companies 
Shanda and Nexon announced a world record for simultaneous online play of 
700,000 users, playingCrazy Arcade (BnB), a game where families play a simple 
virtual world game as teams against other families online.[1]. h <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; In 2005, eBay's Internet Games category, hosted $30 million in trade 
for goods (virtual items and currency) that only exist in synthetic worlds [1]. 
Some (not all) game providers have since banned virtual asset and currency 
sales, driving much of this traffic to third party sites.</p> i <br>
<br>

&bull; 2D Avatarized IM and chat worlds are popular and profitable, more so 
than 3D. There is already a healthy business in 2D virtual world chat spaces, 
where avatars navigate 2D space, make friends, participate in activities, and 
purchase items. Registration in such worlds is free but access to activities 
and purchase of virtual items (furniture, etc.) costs real money.Playdo in 
Sweden has more than 300,000 registered members in 2006.Habbo Hotel in the UK 
is a similar service.Coke Studios (Coca Cola, Inc.) is the most successful 
branded 2D world where users trade music, wander, chat, and collect items for 
their 2D &quot;studios.&quot; Yahoo IM avatars can be upgrade with faces, 
outfits, and backgrounds for a small fee. These low-latency and efficient 2D 
worlds are still vastly more popular than 3D, and may remain so for some time. 
This is especially evident in the Korean market. 2D virtual worlds likePuzzle 
Pirates are presently trying to bring this formula to the US and Europe. j <br>

<br> &bull; While 2D+ social networks (Cyworld in Korea, MySpace, LiveJournal, 
many others in the US) have gone mainstream, 3D worlds have yet to do so. While 
being on a social network of some type is a prerequisite to &quot;being 
cool,&quot; using an open-ended virtual world today (Second Life, There, 
Project Entropia) can still have the opposite effect, positioning you as 
&quot;out of the mainstream.&quot; k <br>
<br>
&bull; Since many of the legal 
liability issues of virtual spaces haven't been resolved, perhaps only smaller 
companies, willing to take calculated risks, can pioneer the development of 
virtual worlds at present.Linden Lab (creators of Second Life) is a rare 
example of a company willing to accept the emergence of loosely controlled 
user-generated content and expression within their world, including 
pornographic content on the adult version of the world, and user mashups 
involving visual imagery that is not their own intellectual property. Summit 
quote #1: &quot;As an outsider one of the reasons why Second Life works is 
because you've got management who was willing to take the positions that 
they've taken on sex and IP etc. That would seem the rare thing: finding a 
management team willing to make those decisions again.&quot; Summit quote #2: 
&quot;I was at theAustin Game Conference talking to a big shot from Sony 
Online, he was talking about how great it was to see SL succeeding... I said if 
you like it so much, how come when I play a Sony game I can't at least upload a 
coat of arms to wear on my armor? Nothing else, just give me that. And he said, 
'Oh no we can't do that because then we'll have Nazis running around 
everywhere.'&quot; l <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; Virtual tourism is in its infancy. Beginning with interactive CDs in 
the 1980s, virtual tourism is slowly gaining interest. Communities fromGeoplace 
to theVirtual Terrain Project exist to promote tools for constructing the real 
world in interactive, 3D digital form. The attractiveness of virtual tourism 
systems seems today to be a complex function of hardware (speed and 
resolution), design (interface intutiveness), and software (story appeal and 
usefulness in connection to &quot;real world&quot; activities). As the market 
develops, software should increasingly become the key differentiator among 
competing VT systems, as we have seen with video games and online worlds. In 
coming years, when we have significantly faster computers, and can rapidly tour 
&quot;interactive Los Angeles&quot; or &quot;interactive Yosemite&quot; and 
sample micronarratives before deciding which of the many possible experiences 
we will take in a given day, and when this platform is integrated into 
tomorrow's browsers and today's passive, narrative-driven experiences likeLA 
City View or the Travel Channel, virtual tourism is likely to be a very 
compelling activity.</p> m <br>
<br>
&bull; There is a gap between advertising 
dollars spent on television, print, and other media versus video games. Of $80 
billion spent on advertising worldwide, only 10% of is games-related. This is 
disproportionate to the time people spend playing, so there may be room for 
significant growth in game advertising revenue. Some believe in-game 
advertising can grow significantly, but others believe such product placement 
will be too disruptive to be tolerated in many game environments (e.g., picture 
soft drink ads inside a medieval fantasy game). Nevertheless, there is still 
significant room for advertising around the delivery of the game, as during 
free downloads of advertiser-supported game modules. Making a bet on in-game 
placement, Microsoft recently purchased the in-game advertising company,Massive 
Inc. Michael Cassidy of Xfire at E3 2006 said &quot;$15 billion is spent on TV 
advertising. Less than 1% today spent on gamers. But 18-34 year old men spend 
more time playing video games than watching TV. If you believe in an efficient 
market, there's going to be a huge shift into gamers.&quot; n <br>

&bull; 
The AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry is a major 
constituency driving metaverse development. They see 3D geospatial 
visualization programs like Google Earth as major new tools for
&quot;location-based simulation.&quot; The US, Europe, and China are all 
experimenting with virtual geographic environments for city planning, building, 
construction, modeling. o <br>
<br>
&bull; Local positioning systems (LPS), 
extensions ofGPS tracking systems in use in shipping logistics, allow the 
ability to identify and inventory all objects in a local space, which in turn 
can be used to improve the value of 2D and 3D GIS visualizations. Chief among 
LPS solutions today areRFID systems, which integrate microprocessors, memory, 
modems, antennas, and power sources on a piece of silicon the size of grain of 
rice to a postage stamp. 3M sells anRFID Tracking Solution that allows the 
realtime location of physical files, and other important objects throughout the 
office. Privacy advocates have major concerns with RFID tracking, which is both 
invasive of privacy and not secure, as the chips can easily be interrogated and 
spoofed. Nevertheless, their use for object tracking, and their ability to feed 
this data into visualizations, continues to grow. p <br>

&bull; 3D 
navigation systems are emerging in Japan and Europe. 2D navigation systems come 
preinstalled on many new cars, boats, and planes, and are available on portable 
units for $200-2,000. Verizon'sVZ Navigator is a cell phone service with 
turn-by-turn directions and voice instruction for $10/month.Honda's navigation 
system provides spoken response to 700 natural language commands. q <br>

<p><strong>2C. Current Conditions - Social, Legal and Other</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; Dramatic rise of social networks and social virtual worlds. While 
there have been many false starts and fadeouts (Tribe, Ryze, Yahoo! 360, etc.), 
today's leading 2D social networks like MySpace (94 million users), Xanga (27 
million users),Bebo (22 million users) and Orkut (16 million users), etc., have 
experienced sustained explosive growth in recent years. Most focus on the youth 
demographic, rapid adopters of new online behavior. MySpace is now thefourth 
most popular English language website, according to Alexa Internet, adding an 
astonishing 500,000 new users a week (Jul 2006). Automation allows these users 
to be supported by a company of only 500 employees. MySpace supports streaming 
audio and internet video, giving it limited 3D functionality and making it very 
popular with independent musicians and filmmakers. A number of these 
communities, like Cyworld (18 million users), Habbo Hotel (7 million users) and 
Playdo (300,000 users) also support avatars and the navigation of 2D social 
space, making them true &quot;social worlds.&quot; Finally, a few social 
worlds, likeSecond Life (340,000 users) and There, offer a fully 3D immersive 
experience, but have the slowest acquisition rates, as the technology overhead 
and user effort required for 3D worlds remain higher at present.</p> a <br>
<br>
<p>&bull; The state of online and virtual worlds time statistics today is 
poor. The BLS'sAmerican Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a major new undertaking that 
will give us insights into actual time use changes from year to year in 
American workplaces and households. The first official 2005 dataset has not yet 
been released, butearly datasets have been analyzed in the first ATUS 
conference. Various non-ATUS studies have estimated that Americans spend 
roughly 35 hours per week either at school or at their jobs, and another 35 
hours a week in leisure activities. Of this latter 35 they spend roughly 10 
hours watching television. In their small annual phone survey,Harris Interactive
 estimated that the average American spent 9 hours online in 2006, up from 7 in 
1999. Based on the movement of reading from physical to virtual space, a 1997
OC&amp;C Strategy report estimated that by 2010 people would spend more time 
online than reading books, magazines, and newspapers combined. The 2006 ESAGame 
Player Data page claims that 50% of all Americans play video games, and that 
the average male game player plays 7.6 hours, and adult female game player 
plays 7.4 hours/week. They also claim that 44% of the most frequent video game 
players play online games. Other studies estimate that youth &quot;heavy 
gamers&quot;, the top 25% of youth gamers, mostly male, age 14-17 years of age, 
spend on the order of 20-30 hours/week playing games. ESA claims that women 
represent about 38% of the total game playing population. In Korea, where 
broadband penetration is greatest, a 2000 study estimated that 80% of all youth 
(8-24 years) played games online at least once a month.</p> b <br>
<br>
&bull; 
There is presently very weak broadband leadership at the federal level. Despite 
several Korean studies linking broadband development with economic prosperity 
and social welfare, and the obvious value of broadband as a platform for Web 
2.0 innovation, there are no government initiatives to accelerate broadband 
development in the United States. President Bush's Technology Agenda gives only 
the expectedlip service to broadband development, and touting minor economic 
incentives such as a two year deferment on the plannedInternet Access Tax (hey 
look, we didn't tax your access this year!) as examples of progress, but offers 
no specific monies, strategy, or program. c <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; The rising importance of &ldquo;Network Neutrality&rdquo; Policies. 
Lesiglation and activism that guarantees democratic access to the network. In 
August 2005, the FCC adopted the following guidelines regarding network 
neutrality:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Consumers are entitled to access the lawful 
Internet content of their choice;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Consumers are entitled to 
run applications and services of their choice, subject to the needs of law 
enforcement;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Consumers are entitled to connect their choice 
of legal devices that do not harm the network; and<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;4. 
Consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application and 
service providers, and content providers.<br>
 Regulators have increasingly 
shown willingness to require broadband providers (cable, DSL, wireless) to 
eliminate competitive restrictions on network usage (e.g., ensuring the 
consumer has freedom to run free VoIP programs likeSkype over telco-run 
broadband infrastructure, to set up Wi-Fi extensions on home networks, etc.). 
These emerging &ldquo;network neutrality&rdquo; policies bode well for U.S. 
consumer rights to run complex 3D applications in coming years. Even if such 
applications compete with existing provider offerings, are bandwidth intensive 
and force network upgrade, network providers have few options to restrict 
network usage.</p> d <br>
<br>
&bull; Transparent cities. Public surveillance 
in some cities is already in an advanced state. In London today,closed-circuit 
TV networks take pictures of many drivers of cars as they enter the city, 
record and run their licence plates, and officers check for major law 
violators. The network can be used to visually search for the car and the 
pedestrian throughout the city if an arrest is warranted. Over an afternoon of 
public driving and walking, a citizen might be photographed 200 times by the 
network. As image recognition improves, such networks will allow a virtual 
realtime map of city auto and foot traffic, a major advance for secure cities. e
<br> <br>
&bull; The online pornography industry is now innovating internet 
video on demand (VOD), with downloads burnable to DVD. Many of these VOD 
aplications allow unlimited burns to disk. It is questionable whether this 
&quot;multiple-burn policy&quot; will spread to other content providers, as 
pornography is less socially sharable than other media. Controlling copy count 
still seems by far the most prevalent future business model for providers of 
most types of proprietary content, with promotional samples and small 
independent material available free on public download sites. f <br>
<br>

&bull; A high diversity cost of current content filters. We want the web to be 
an intimate social medium. Yet we also want it to be one with fine-grained 
filters for those who want them, and in this function it presently fails 
(pornography, spam, etc.). Communities and platforms (AOL, etc.) can provide 
such filters, but presently in a coarse-grained manner, that involves a loss of 
diversity. g <br>
<br>
&bull; Virtual-physical commerce and social fusions. 
Many virtual world businesses and social activities can&rsquo;t be easily 
partitioned between physical and virtual components. Consider an e-commerce 
site, or a virtual real estate site that has employees in the physical world, 
or online social communities that involve both virtual and physical world 
meetups. h <br>
<br>
 &bull; MMOGs like World of Warcraft (WoW) have been 
called &ldquo;the new golf&rdquo; (only partially tongue in cheek) among online 
gamers because they are an excuse to get together and talk about real world 
life (business, social events) while engaging in automatic and ritualized 
behavior. The &quot;stickiness&quot; of WoW is that it is a shared experience. 
You are able to talk about anything you want while working your group through a 
relatively simple arc of gameplay. i <br>
<br>
&bull; Online virtual worlds can 
already be considered places where social behavior is &quot;prototyped,&quot; 
and several social scientists now conduct research on social behavior in 
virtual worlds like Second Life, aided by their superior transparency to 
physical space. j <br>
<br>
&bull; According to <em>The Economist</em> 
magazine, China has roughly 30,000 people employed specifically censoring their 
domestic websites, but it&rsquo;s almost all political censorship, very narrow 
in scope. There are at present few signs that this kind of top-down censorship 
is significantly impeding the increasing sophistication and personalization of 
either the internet or its web services. In fact, the Chinese effort shares 
many features of failed Soviet centralized information control programs from 
the 1950s to 1980&rsquo;s, a far simpler era in terms of information management.

&bull; In 2001, 39% of 3,916 respondents to a survey of EverQuest 
players said that if they could make enough money selling things from Norrath 
[the EverQuest world] they would quit their current job or school and make 
their money there instead [1]. l <br>
<br>
&bull; Legal and political 
implications of virtual world use are just beginning to be considered. The 
reality of individuals making their livings via work in virtual economies, most 
without income reporting or taxation, is beginning to reach mainstream 
awareness. This has recently attracted attention in the mainstream business 
media (&quot;My Virtual Life,&quot; Business Week, 2006), but so far there has 
been little political response [17]. Lawyers are already looking at the virtual 
worlds space, and a growing number are very interested in the issues. The 
Harvard/NYU/YaleState of Play conference began the legal education around this 
space in 2003. Summit quote: &quot;I remember in NY when the Internet was 
getting to be something, the lawyers were early. It's interesting that they're 
early here as well.&quot; m <br>
<br>
&bull; There is very limited 
interoperabilty between virtual worlds, for technical, business, and gameplay 
reasons. Summit quote: &quot;We can't just take WoW and mesh it with SL. Their 
policies and mechanics are inherently in conflict.&quot; n <br>
<br>
&bull; The 
Nintendo Generation. There is a gamer generation that is psychologically and 
culturally augmented to navigate virtual space and socialize within and around 
these environments. This perspective was persuasively outlined from the 
perspective of educational reform in a National Academies publication,<em>
Reinventing Schools: The Technology is Now!</em> (2000) [18], and the cultural 
effects of modern digital and interactive media recently chronicled in Steven 
Johnson's new book,<em>Everything Bad is Good For You</em>, 2006 [19]. Summit 
quote: &quot;Talking about augmentation and youth and the fact that we adapt 
[to our technology], this generation is much more game savvy than the last one. 
When you start saying what this game savviness is, it's really augmentation. 
They've learned different patterns for interaction [with virtual systems]&quot;

<p>&bull; Personal cartography is emerging. People with time and patience can 
createannotations of their local spaces and journeys using tools like Google 
Maps [20], and there is a mash-up startup that revolves around people telling 
their personal travel stories in sharable cartographic journals. Increasingly 
these will maps will also have 3D (video, 3D object, and virtual world) 
components.</p> p <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; Serious games and training simulations have been used for decades 
and are seeing increasing use by the military and other large organizations. 
Beginning with theSerious Games Initiative in 2000, the serious games community 
(game-based education and training occurring outside the traditional primary 
and secondary educational software markets) has grown steadily. SimuLearn's
Virtual Leader, a corporate workforce training tool used in a few Fortune 1000 
companies and developed with the budget of a normal video game, won awards in 
2003.America's Army, a free first-person shooter owned and distributed by the 
U.S. government, has been a very effective, and controversial, global public 
relations and recruiting tool. Summit quote: &quot;Training time has gone down 
from the amount of time new recruits have spent playing first person 
shooters.&quot;</p> q <br>
<br>
&bull; Most virtual environments today still 
socially isolate us, distract us, and undereducate us more than they empower us 
in the physical world. We may still be in or just leaving Stage 1, the 
dehumanizing stage, of John Smart's proposedThree Stages of Technological 
Development. Summit quote: &quot;First generation technologies are usually net 
dehumanizing, they have disruptive social effects, are crude, and don't get the 
interface right. The second generation is ambivalent to humanity, with new 
benefits but persistent drawbacks. Third generation technologies, with luck and 
repeated feedback, are usually net humanizing.&quot; Let's hope we can move 
quickly to later generations of these very important social technologies. r <br>
<br> &bull; First generation exergames, also known as active video games 
(AVGs), are becoming broadly adopted [69]. Konami'sDance Dance Revolution and 
imitators are a flagship exergame. Sony'sEyeToy has a number of exergames, and 
Nintendo'sWii console will be coming out motion controllers that will bring 
physical activity to the video game. Exergames reverse the bias that video 
games will continue to contribute to the obesity epidemic presently seen in all 
youth in the developed worlds and many in the emerging nations.Get Up Move a 
site that promotes fitness with exergames, reports that people have lost weight 
and improved school performance by using them. s <br>

<p><strong>3. Constants.</strong> Important metaverse-relevant things expected 
to remain the same (continue as is) in coming years.</p> 
<p><strong>3A. Constants - Technology and Science</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; Learning/experience curve (Henderson's law). This observation, first 
quantified for aircraft production in 1936, and later generalized by Bruce 
Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group in the 1960's, notes that the time and 
cost to perform a broad range of technological tasks decreases exponentially in 
repeated trials. More generally, with each doubling in total production, unit 
production cost for a given level of performance or capacity falls by a 
predictable and generally constant percentage. While each particular technology 
paradigm will improve on a decaying exponential curve approaching a fixed 
performance limit, ongoing important problems usually elicit periodic 
technology shifts, allowing average capacity doubling times to remain 
relatively stable for long periods of time. Most classes of technology problems 
show experience curve price/performance improvements from 10 to 30% with each 
doubling of production. Most technologies at the human scale, such as 
transportation, eventually saturate, though they may proceed through many 
decades of exponential improvement, through a range of paradigms, before they 
do so. By comparison, technologies at the nanoscale may in theory continue 
their exponentiation past the limits of human systems, as they are driven by 
the discovery and implementation of the unique physics of the nanocosm, not 
human creativity, and as informational nanotechnologies become increasingly 
autonomous (human-independent) with time. Experience curves for ICT and 
nanotechnology argue that many of the computing and communication tools 
available only to the most powerful corporations today will be affordable to 
the poorest global citizens in coming years.</p> a <br>

&bull; Computing 
growth (Moore's Law), human-competitive machine performance (HCMP), and the 
Technological Singularity. Beginning in the mid 1960's, Gordon Moore observed 
that the price/performance ratio of computing hardware doubles every 18-24 
months. Every 5 years has thus provided as much as 10X additional computing 
platform capacity, and every 15 years as much as 1,000X additional delivered 
capacity. This has allowed successively more computing-intensive performance 
thresholds (desktop publishing, 3D graphics, PDA's etc.) to be crossed for mass 
market ICT devices. Ray Kurzweil has extended this observation back 120 years, 
charting an initial doubling rate of 36 months for mechanical computing devices 
of the late 1800's. Given the unique properties of the microcosm, this growth 
is widely expected to continue in our information technology for the forseeable 
future, enabling exponentially more immersive and intelligent virtual worlds 
with each passing year. Another Moore's law-dependent constant we have observed 
is that increasingly complex &quot;actions&quot; of human labor and 
&quot;modules&quot; of human intelligence, have been achieved in a 
human-competitive fashion in our robotic, automation, and IT systems. A few 
HCMP objectives have even been achieved using biologically-inspired, 
evolutionary computing strategies [22]. Should this progressive and modular 
&quot;machine takeover&quot; of human physical and intellectual tasks continue, 
which is presently the most reasonable assumption, at some point future machine 
performance will achieve generalized human competitive abilities even in the 
highest human functions. This would be a global transition, or phase change, 
that technology scholars and futurists call the &quot;technological 
singularity.&quot; Many classes of accelerating technological change have been, 
in the long term, a surprisingly constant and inexorable progression, and they 
present major opportunities and challenges for social guidance in the process. 
Books like Ray Kurzweil's<em>The Singularity is Near</em>, 2005 [35] are 
commendable early efforts at charting these developmental trends, yet this 
phenomenon remains largely understudied at present. b <br>

&bull; 
Miniaturization growth and theunreasonable efficiency of the Microcosm 
(Kurzweil, Mead, Smart). Ray Kurzweil has observed that many technological 
processes shrink by an average factor four per linear dimension per decade. In 
computing, miniaturization is a leading contributor to price/performance 
acceleration. Semiconductor feature sizes shrink in half every 5.4 years in two 
dimensions, doubling the number of circuits per area every 2.7 years [35,37]. 
Increasing system integration capabilities on small scales is another major 
contributor. Computing has moved from mechanical, to electromechanical, to 
vacuum tubes, to transistors, to integrated circuits, and integrated circuits 
have become multicore ICs and system-on-a-chip (SoC) platforms. In the sensor 
and effector space we are making a growing variety ofmicroelectromechanical 
systems (MEMS), enabling new features. Carver Mead has long noted the 
&quot;unreasonable efficiency&quot; of the microcosm. The smaller we make our 
computing systems, the more efficient they become, often yielding astounding 
and &quot;unreasonable&quot; efficiency increases. John Smart has charted 
stepwise efficiency/performance advances of 10,000X, 100,000X, 1,000,000X and 
beyond with incremental redesign in microscopic systems, advances that greatly 
exceed the average magnitude of gains we see from system redesign at the 
macroscopic scale. As far as we can see into our extraordinary future materials 
scientists and research physicists expect these new efficiencies to continue to 
emerge, driving the miniaturization trend forward, and making the idea of 
highly effective and largely invisible wearable and ubiquitous computing, 
sensing, effecting, and communication systems a likelihood in coming decades. c

<p>&bull; Polygon count growth, motion control point growth, and the Reality 
Threshold (Smith). Polygon count generated by leading video game hardware 
doubles roughly every 2 years. Alvy Ray Smith of Microsoft/Pixar has estimated 
that the &quot;reality threshold&quot; (simulations indistinguishable from 
ordinary human vision) is 80 million polygons per frame, and on the order of a 
million motion control points on the objects within our field of view [21]. 
Microsoft'sXbox had a peak capacity of 2.1 million polygons per frame. Xbox 360 
peaks at 8.3 million polygons (triangles) per frame (the PS3 will have only 
half this, yet another reason it may be a big setback for Sony). The faces of 
the best digital actors inToy Story (1996) had over 100 motion control points. 
InToy Story 2 (1999) they had over 1,000 motion control points. If these trends 
continue, the reality threshold may as close as eight years away, in 2014. 
While the actual transition might take twice this time (2022), it is clear that 
within a relatively short time our best simulated realities will be 
indistinguishable from physical reality. This is a development with global 
implications, as it promises to eliminate the current sensory opportunity cost 
of spending extended time in virtual environments. After this point, we may 
consider our best 3D online spaces to be &quot;hyperreal&quot; (environments 
with simulation capacity, and eventually entertainment, education and 
productivity capacity, that exceeds reality).</p> d <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; Software algorithmic efficiency and simulation/representation 
capacity growth (Kurzweil, Ebrahimi). Algorithmic efficiency is a vast and 
technical topic that is dependent on automation, representation schemes, 
processing capacity growth, and experience curves, among other factors. Even 
with &quot;software bloat,&quot; general software efficiency for many classes 
of problem has been quoted by Ray Kurzweil and others as doubling in 
price/performance efficiency every six years [35]. While still a dramatic 
growth rate, the doubling period is nevertheless three to four times slower 
than Moore's law. As Touradj Ebrahimi notes [36], algorithmic efficiency in 
video compression has doubled every five years for the last fifteen years.H.263 
video encoding (1995) is twice as good asH.261 (1990), and H.264/MPEG-4 v10 
(2003) is twice as good asMPEG-4 v1 (1998). Further developments will show if 
these growth rates continue to hold, but as we continually learn new ways to 
represent, locally store, and generate data, these growth constants seem a 
reasonable expectation for many classes of visual, sensory, and system 
simulation. Compression in portable audio (audio simulation/re-representation) 
capacity has grown at a roughly similar rate. First available in the DiamondRio 
PMP300 in 1998, CD-quality mp3's (128kbps MPEG-1 layer 3), had a 10X 
compression over files in thePulse Code Modulation (PCM) based compact disks 
that played on Sony's first portable CD player, theDiscman D-50, in 1984. 
MPEG-4 AAC audio compression, available on today's iPod, offers modest 
additional compression over mp3. As Barry Vercoe of MIT notes, future audio 
standards are evolving toward a postscript-like, &quot;structured audio&quot; 
description language, which will allow audio files another 10X compression over 
mp3. Today's structured audio is not yet CD quality, but if the historical 
growth rate continues, we may see such a format used in portable players in 
2012. In combination with storage growth trends, today's 60 GB, 15,000 song 
iPod will be capable of storing 2.4 million songs in 2014, more than the entire 
current song catalogs of today's leading online sites (iTunes Music Store, 
URGE, etc.). With regard to system simulation,virtual machines like VMWare, and 
such tools assoftware defined radio are examples of the representational 
capacity in software of a large and ever growing class of hardware systems. 
Such constant performance advances are strong evidence that not only hardware, 
but software will continue its accelerating ability to deliver simulated 
reality.</p> e <br>

<p>&bull; Digital storage capacity growth (Kryder's Law). Density of 
information on digital storage devices has been doubling every 23 months, on 
average, since 1956. This observation is named after Mark Kryder, a storage 
research pioneer. Rapidly increasing storage capacity has enabled successive 
thresholds in database complexity, allowing the mass storage and manipulation 
of digital pictures, audio, video, HD video, etc. One development being enabled 
by this is theLifelog, a storage system that allows persistent global access, 
retrieval, and potential sharing of all past information generated by an 
individual user's life experience, in various data categories (email, websites 
visited, GPS coordinates visited, audio, video, etc.). The mass-accessible 
lifelog threshold for email was crossed in 2004 with the advent ofGoogle Gmail, 
which began by offering 1 gigabyte of free email storage to users. Consistent 
with Kryder's law, Gmail adds storage behind the scenes daily. amd as of June 
2006 offers 2.7 GB to their users, a growth rate well in excess of many user's 
email needs, including attachments.Flock, a Web2.0 browser, is developing a 
lifelog of all previous websites visited, and using this as a basis for 
context-sensitive internet search queries initiated by the user, displayed 
preferentially at the top of the list in the manner ofGoogle Desktop. The No. 2 
telco in Japan, KDDI Corp, has developed theLifelog Pod, software that keeps 
track of every user action (photos, searches, MP3 listens, software runs) made 
through a cellphone or computer, extending one's searchable memory into even 
the minor details of their online history [64].SLStats is a log program, 
activated by a watch your avatar wears in Second Life, that records simple 
statistics on the user's in-game activity.Passively Multiplayer is a research 
idea for more broadly recording and sharing user data generated in virtual 
worlds. Having one's life experiences auto-archived, persistently available, 
and only a voice query away is a threshold with major implications, including 
both personal empowerment and the potential for abuse of privacy, if accessible 
to others. We will need new social conventions for consented recording of 
public experiences, but we see nothing that would stop large fractions of the 
global population, particularly youth, from running lifelogs for personal and 
trusted network use as computing technology improves.</p> f <br>

&bull; 
Wired bandwidth growth (Gilder's law,Nielsen's law). George Gilder originally 
observed in the 1980's that wired bandwidth capacity was doubling every 6-18 
months, apparently faster than Moore's law. Jakob Nielsen later amended this 
observation to note that premium internet users received new bandwidth at an 
annual growth rate of 50%, giving a doubling rate of 21 months from 1983-1998, 
a rate slower than processor capacity growth (Moore's law) over this same 
period. Bandwidth growth has since continued at the 21 month rate, with the 
average premium (cable modem) user in 2006 receiving5 megabits per second of 
bandwidth, exactly whatNielsen's 1998 graph predicted a typical premium user 
would have in 2005. Projecting this forward into the next generation bandwidth 
technology, fiber to the home, Utah'sUTOPIA initiative is today delivering 30 
megabit per second access to 14 lucky cities in Utah, and will soon offer 100 
megabits/second. At this rate, a two hour video on demand movie can be 
downloaded in six minutes [23]. As fiber to the home rolls out, we can forsee a 
world of ubiquitous video on demand, and the opportunity forVideo Wall 
emergence, bringing simultaneous video multicasts with internet video, HD 
video, group videoconferencing, 3D worlds, and other streams to large 
wall-sized displays in many rooms of the future home (see Predictions - 
Sci-Tech, Video Wall). g <br>

<p>&bull; Wireless bandwidth growth (Cooper's law). Martin Cooper observed 
that the spectrum efficiency of radio communication (both voice and data) has 
doubled every two and a half years, over 104 years, since radio waves were 
first used for communication. Frequency, spatial, and code division 
multiplexing, modulation techniques, mesh networks, and now smart antennas are 
examples of technologies that have kept wireless bandwidth on this growth path. 
Today, CDMA EVDO 1X is available from Verizon Wireless and Sprint in the U.S. 
for $60/month, delivering peak cellular modem speeds of2.4 megabits/second in 
just 1.25 Mhz of spectrum. This presently allows rapid web browsing, very light 
streaming video and audio to the mobile user, and dedicated VoIP. EV-DO 
Revision A, allowing3.1 megabits per second [24], are scheduled for commercial 
release in late 2006 [25]. In late 2007, Qualcomm will release CDMA EV-DO 
Revision B data modem and cellphone chips to card makers, which will provide up 
to14.7 megabits per second on downlink. When these emerge in 2008 they will 
enable such mobile features as television, and internet browsing while making 
VoIP calls, and the enough extra bandwidth to support location-based streaming 
radio in the car (a huge new market, see: Predictions: Business and Econ) [26].

<p>&bull; Flat panel display (FPD) growth (Nishimura's, Kitihara's and 
Odawara's laws). From the U.S. Display Consortium (USDC) website: 
&quot;Nishimura's Law, states that the size of [the glass] substrate used [and 
thus the display size available at the same cost] grows by a factor of 1.8 
every 3 years, i.e., it doubles every 3.6 years, less than half the time IC 
wafers take to double in size (7.5 years). Kitihara's Law describes the 
evolution of FPD panels. In each three-year cycle, the average screen area 
grows 44 percent, while the power consumption required for a given function 
decreases by 44 percent and panel thickness and weight is reduced by one-third. 
The law further estimates that the number of bits needed to specify the image 
on the screen has increased fourfold every cycle, matching Moore's Law for ICs. 
Odawara's Law centers on [desktop and wall mounted FPD] panel prices, stating 
that each doubling in the cumulative area of flat panels produced results in a 
cost reduction of 22 to 23 percent [per area produced]. The cost of a 
full-color active matrix LCD cell-phone display, however, is expected to remain 
about six times higher than would be expected by applying this theory. This 
creates a market-entry opportunity [in the small form factor screens] for 
AMLCDs made with polysilicon thin-film transistors, organic light-emitting 
diodes (OLEDs) and electronic paper.&quot; Keeping these laws on track will 
require alternative technologies or new materials, or both at some point.</p> i

<p>&bull; Battery energy density growth, cycle life growth, and charge time 
reduction, and thePervasive Computing threshold. Since batteries were 
commercialized 147 years ago we have seen just two doublings in energy density 
(a modest constant of 0.9% capacity growth per year), three doublings in cycle 
life (1.4% improvement/year, and six halvings in charge time (3% 
improvement/year). Nevertheless, after decades of research neglect, recent 
attempts to improve the nanostructure of solid battery technology have yielded 
dramatic improvements in cycle life (more than a 2X increase), and charge time 
(an impressive 15X reduction) in just the last few years. We can anticipate 
these significant gains to increase over the near term, taking us past a 
&quot;pervasiveness threshold,&quot; where our portable electronics will 
experience no significant downtime. Figures below are for commercial 
cylindrical batteries, cost/cycle is in 2001 prices [27,28]:</p> <strong>Type

development on nanobattery they claim is 80% lighter, has 10X longer cycle 
life, 5X power gain, and &quot;dramatically faster&quot; charge time vs. 
conventional batteries.Toshiba has announced a portable nanobattery, expected 
commercially in 2008, which recharges80% of its power in 60 seconds. This will 
allow users of portable and wearable electronics to recharge while waiting, 
eliminating one of the major problems with current portability of the 3D web. 
In addition to enabling ubiquitous portable electronics, nanobatteries will 
eventually allow hybrid electric vehicle owners to recharge their batteriesas 
fast as they fill their gas tanks, at fast charge stations like PosiCharge. 
With electricity at only 70 cents per gallon equivalent when drawn in off-peak 
hours (roughly twice this cost in peak hours), these will be deployed privately 
at a greatly increasing frequency in the coming decade.</p> j <br>

<p>&bull; Network address density growth (Poor's Law) and the Transparent 
Society. In the early 1990's Robert Poor observed that spatial network address 
density, a measurement of digital connectivity, doubles every 12 months in 
urban environments [29]. This rapid doubling rate, more rapid than all the 
growth constants yet discussed (and not yet independently quantified) has major 
implications for the structure of physical reality and nature of the 3D web. 
Taken together with constant growth trends in miniaturization, processing, 
storage, bandwidth, energetics, and sensor and effector efficiency, this trend 
makes it reasonable to assume a coming world of incredible public and consented 
private data accessibility, or<br>
 &quot;transparency&quot; in our global 
digital networks, as outlined in David Brin's<strong><em>The Transparent Society
</em></strong>, 1998 [30], as well as a very high degree of fidelity in our 
digital and visual &quot;mirror worlds,&quot; as forecast in David Gelernter's
<em>Mirror Worlds</em>, 1993 [31]. The next networking protocol, IPv6, already 
in early deployment, will move us beyond the present 4.3 billion addresses of 
IPv4 (allowing not even one IP address per person) to 3.4x10^38 addreses, or 50 
octillion for each of the 6.5 billion people alive today, plenty enough to give 
every important physical item, no matter how small, its own connection to the 
web. This will enable a world of embedded, ubiquitous, and pervasive computing, 
as outlined in such books as<em>When Things Start to Think</em> (2000) [4], <em>
Ambient Findabilty</em> (2005) [32], <em>Geospatial Matters</em> (2006) [33], 
and<em>Everyware</em> (2006) [34].</p> k <br>

&bull; Network value growth 
by structure (Sarnoff's,Metcalfe's, and Reed's Laws), Social Networks, and the 
Participatory Web. Broadcast pioneer David Sarnoff noted the value of a 
broadcast network to the broadcaster is linearly proportional to the number of 
users. Bob Metcalf noted that the total value of a network to its users grows 
exponentially, and may be as high as the square of the total number of 
users/nodes (n squared, though the actual value is probably closer ton log(n)). 
David Reed noted that when a network allows users to form their own 
self-determined groups within the network, total value may grow in proportion 
to 2^n, a rate greater than the square of the nodes, as it accounts for the 
additional value of the overlapping subgroups. Taken together, these network 
theories dictate a trend toward the &quot;participatory web:&quot; as the 
global internet develops, utility economics will drive it to become an 
infrastructure that facilitates social networks, secondarily an open network, 
and only tertiarily a hierarchical network. Even with today's primitive network 
we are already seeing early disruptions and flattening of the hierarchies, and 
it is clear we can expect much more of this in coming years, as the individual 
actor is increasingly empowered relative to the most powerful nodes in the 
system. l <br>

&bull; Differential learning curves of Technology, 
Business, and Society (Smart). As John Smart and others have observed, with 
rare exceptions, culture changes more slowly than business, and business 
changes more slowly than technology. Recall the hyperbole in<em>Wired</em> and 
other leading magazines about the way the internet was going to imminently 
revolutionize both business and culture during the early &quot;Awe&quot; stage 
of the internet (mid-to-late 1990's). Only today are web strategies beginning 
to broadly revolutionize business, and perhaps only in another decade or beyond 
should we expect them to revolutionize culture, through the spread of the 
participatory web, social networks, internet television, digital democracy, and 
collaborative culture. As Brian Arthur of Santa Fe Institute notes, the first 
years of the railroad, telegraph, auto, airplane, and other disruptive 
technologies produced similarly inflated expectations--and investment bubbles. 
As Roy Amara of IFTF says (Amara's Law), &quot;we tend to overestimate the 
[business and social] effects of a [disruptive] technology in the short run, 
and underestimate the effects in the long run.&quot; m <br>

LED brightness growth (Haitz's Law). &quot;For nearly three decades--from the

projections by Roland Haitz. In this decade, the rate of doubling has increased 
from every 24 months to about 18 months.&quot; According to the above article,

<p><strong>3B. Constants - Business and Economics</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; Information technology's (IT's) share of GDP and economic growth and 
the emergingMetaverse Sector. In the way it is currently measured by the 
Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) of the Department of Commerce, 
the U.S. information technology sector (IT hardware, software, and services, 
including communications, both business and consumer) contributed only 8% to 
U.S. GDP in 2003 [38]. What's more, its growth as a percentage of our total 
economy is an anemic 3% per year, a doubling time of 23 years [35]. But even 
though the IT sector's total share of the economy remains low, its marginal 
contribution to U.S. productivity is very high, indicating a structural 
transition is underway. Between 1997 and 2003, the IT sector's contribution to 
marginal GDP growth averaged 40%, and was as high as 80% in some recessionary 
years (<em>Digital Economy 2003</em>, Table 1.1). IT's contribution to the 
productivity of non-IT sector industries (entertainment, education, 
manufacturing, retail, tourism) is not included here, and must make the total 
IT figure substantially higher. This is evidence that IT, not services, is now 
the largest marginal driver of U.S. economic growth. Classic economic theory 
charts U.S. economic development from Resources, to Products, to Services 
sectors over time.Structural change occurs in an economy when GDP (or for the 
world, GWP) or employment in one sector grows to exceed another. We contend 
that the emerging IT-based metaverse sector, economic activity enabled and 
managed by our 2D and early 3D digital web (including not only traditional IT 
but all digital media, geospatial web, wireless and participatory web 
technologies), will surpass, encompass and redefine each of the three 
traditional economic sectors in coming decades, the way each have done during 
their own historical emergence. Providing plausible indicators and examples of 
metaverse sector development is a major goal of our roadmap. From a marginal 
perspective, it is clear this transition has already taken place. It may take 
another generation or two for the metaverse sector, however liberally defined, 
to grow to represent the majority of us GDP or employment, but the marginal 
slowdown in traditional economic sectors, as well as general economic slowdown 
during the transition, is already being charted by leading economists, as with
<em>The Way it Worked and Why it Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of 
U.S. Economic Growth</em>, Gordon Bjork's 1999 analysis of the maturing U.S. 
economy, as it waits for the emergence of a global metaverse-enabled service 
and automation economy.</p> a <br>

&bull; The video game market will 
continue to grow at a healthy rate for the foreseeable future, as increasingly 
global youth markets are established, as non-players are targeted by new types 
of games, and as gamers encounter a host of new PC, console and mobile 
computing platforms and faster and better networks. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
estimates that the worldwide video game market, a $28 billion industry today, 
will be$46.5 billion in 2010, an annual growth rate of 11.4%, triple the GDP 
growth in developed economies over the same period. Wireless games will grow 
the fastest, 28% per year, to $2.3 billion in the U.S. and $4.2 billion in Asia 
by 2010 [39]. b <br>

<p>&bull; Virtual world persistence. In contrast to game titles, which 
experience rapid turnover and obsolescence, synthetic worlds rarely go away 
once they achieve any kind of subscriber base. Familiarity and community 
creates unique inertia versus standalone games. The seven year old Ultima 
Online, for example, had 150,000 paying subscribers in 2006. To this day, no 
virtual world has ever been completely shut down unless the operating company 
absolutely forced it to be. Hardcore users keep the communities alive. Games 
likeUru Live, the never-finished online Myst successor, have been kept alive by 
the beta user community. Arthur C. Clarke made this general observation: 
&quot;No communication technology has ever disappeared, but instead becomes 
increasingly less important as the technology horizon widens.&quot; Even the 
most primitive communication technologies (semaphore, morse code) remain used 
by a subculture interested in history. Increasingly, such may be the case with 
any virtual world that develops a passionate user base, subject of course to 
legal and economic hurdles.</p> c <br>

visual interfaces will remain a more efficient solution than 3D for many 
applications. Read&quot;2D is Better than 3D,&quot; [41] for 3D drawbacks 
(increased cognitive overhead, as we are evolutionarily optimized for 2D 
interaction at a distance), and&quot;2D vs 3D, Implications on Spatial 
Memory,&quot; [42] for 3D advantages (better task memory, as we use 3D up 
close). Summit quote: &quot;2D is very powerful. We're going to have a real 
hard time getting away from it [for many applications]. It is one of those 
interesting local maxima. There's a bigger hill over there [3D interfaces that

representational. It has the potential to represent anything: real world data 
sets (as in Google Earth, GIS, and scientific visualization), socially 
constructed visions (MySpace,Second Life), thematic visions (as corporate 
collaboration platforms, role playing games, or worlds with physics unlike our 
own). It can be educational or entertaining, political or prosaic. 
Consistently, however, it returns to fulfilling basic human desires. It is 
first and foremost a social space, allowing persistent connection, exploration, 
innovation, and new ways to fulfill a relatively constant set of human needs. b

<p>&bull; From Janna Anderson&rsquo;s research, the key themes of any 
communication technology center around addressing such values as:<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Identity, Reputation, and Trust<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- Security and 
Privacy<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- Connection, Persistence, and Community<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ease of Use, Portability, Interoperability<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;- 
Affordability and Value<br>
 Each community of users has a threshold value for 
each of these that must be met before a social space will be broadly adopted.

&bull; People will still want privacy in our publicly 
transparent future. How many people want to be on call, available to their 
community 24/7? This is always a small minority, and such individuals are 
usually paid well for their time. Technology exists for our own convenience, 
not just society&rsquo;s convenience. d <br>

&bull; Satisfying user needs 
with simplicity and dependability is a key adoption driver for digital

of what they really wanted (anHTML-based rich media architecture in a simple, 
easy to use interface) for the purpose of showing their personality and 
creativity to their friends. Second Life is primitive vs. other virtual worlds 
but it is simple enough for the early adopters (if not the masses) who want the 
freedom to make their own spaces and stories. e <br>
<br>
&bull; The human 
social environment that emerges in a virtual world is really no different from 
any other human social environment. The virtual world's features and theme may 
look very different, but we bring to it all our predictable social and legal 
norms [1]. f <br>
<br>
&bull; There is an ongoing primal social conflict between
hackers and lawyers (politicians, Hollywood, interest groups, etc.) in 
metaverse space. There is a natural tension between those trying to set the 
code free and those trying to gain IP control over it, or legislate public 
conduct. There will always be cultures and tools supporting each, but polarized 
positions don't take into account the necessity of both. g <br>

<p><strong>4. Assumptions.</strong> Stated or hidden assumptions with regard 
to the emerging 3D web.</p> 
<p><strong>4A. Assumptions - Technology and Science</strong></p> &bull; Some 
interface designers assume a 3D interface will be more intuitive or efficient 
than 2D, but that often isn't true. 1D (text) and 2D are faster and more 
user-friendly for many types of interactions, both with data and with other 
people. As usability gurus like Jakob Nielsen observe (&quot;2D is better than 
3D&quot;), if a particular information set has 100 dimensions, visualizing in 
3D instead of 2D still leaves 97 that must be abstracted, but now you are 
saddled with the cognitive overhead of a third dimension to navigate visually 
and mentally. In other words, you've gone backwards, which is why most 3D 
scientific visualizations are confusing toys that people don't use. They take 
away clarity by comparision to a set of alternative 2D representations, each of 
which can be rapidly scanned, that designers like Edward Tufte,The Visual 
Display of Cognitive Information, 1992 [45], find so useful. a <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; Major technological development will be a necessity for mass web 
collaboration and subsequent 3D web adoption. Many basic features of the
participatory web have yet to be developed, and there is a common assumption 
that we'll need much better collaboration tools (artistic, scientific, 
commercial, and social, etc.) before the web will become the preferred social 
medium over today's dominant communication media, including face to face. Once 
that support exists, some assume that people who find it most efficient to 
collaborate on the web will then gravitate to 3D spaces as their technology 
allows, simply because 3D is more intuitive and less isolating than existing 
interfaces for some forms of social interaction and exploration.</p> b <br>
<br>
&bull; Some assume that avatars will be ubiquitous early in the 3D web, but the 
threshold for mass adoption may be very high. Some think avatars won't make 
sense for general use until we can all talk to our computers verbally, using a 
primitiveconversational interface. Perhaps only when your avatar-butler can 
speak back to you does it make sense to add the parallel nonverbal 
communication that avatar gestures can provide, to increase the efficiency of 
verbal communication. Summit quote: &quot;I'm going to make a generalization. 
Unless the metaverse makes solving our existing problems faster or easier 
people won't use it. And this is why I don't believe that avatars are going to 
be ubiquitous. They don't make things easier [at the present time]. Tabbed 
browsing makes things faster and easier.&quot; c <br>
<br>

<p>&bull; Metaverse designers commonly assume that extending a real world 
metaphor to virtual space is the best way to interact with computers and other 
people. But our fantasy worlds play fast and loose with the laws of physics, 
inventing new rules with less restrictiveness, and even nonfiction virtual 
worlds have common features, such as flying and teleportation that would be 
&quot;supernatural&quot; in physical space. So it might be more accurate to say 
that our best virtual virtual worlds seek to recreate the reality of physical 
space, yet to also exceed the limitations of that reality, in a consistent and 
intuitive way, with persistent rules that can be learned through play, as in 
physical space.</p> d <br>
<br>
&bull; We assume sufficient standards, 
including data transfer protocols, document formats, and other infrastructure 
pieces will emerge to support a rich content metaverse. e <br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>

<br> <br>

<p><strong>4B. Assumptions - Business and Economics</strong></p> &bull; 
Metaverse builders assume an immersive 3D web and more and better virtual 
worlds are things people want at the present time. We assume that new money and 
investment will continue to flow into this sector. Heavy use of virtual worlds 
is clearly compelling for a subset of internet users, some of the time, but we 
have no idea yet how large or cosmopolitan this market can become, or what 
other competitors to their use might emerge. Could augmented reality systems, 
for example, when they arrive, pull people out of our virtual worlds and 
digital spaces and back into physical space in large numbers? Will tomorrow's 
social networks and AI systems reverse the declining time we presently spend in 
real world social interactions, or will we keep choosing to spend more and more 
of our free time &quot;inside boxes, sitting in front of boxes?&quot; What 
about when virtual spaces become so high fidelity that we feeltelepresence 
remotely? It's hard to imagine anything powerful enough to reverse our 
virtualization trend, and yet it must eventually stop growing, and it is a key 
assumption that it will continue. a <br>
<br>
&bull; We assume the metaverse 
(3D enabled web and 3D worlds) will soon be a highly creative place, with users 
generating lots of new content. But how rapidly this participatory web vision 
occurs is yet to be determined. Summit quote #1: &quot;Some of my assumptions 
have to do with [content] generativity. I worry that people look at WoW, it is 
an open game in that you can move around, but it's not so open that you can 
make a spaceship or change the physics. The creativity of the space is limited. 
Creating something original in that space is impossible.&quot; Summit quote #2: 
&quot;We've seen tremendous growth in the non-generative spaces like EverQuest, 
WoW, Legend. These have enormous communities. By comparison, Second Life-style 
spaces have had less growth or less explosive growth. My feeling is that it's 
really hard to be generative in these worlds at present. The assumption is that 
people will be more creative in these spaces. If that assumption is wrong, then 
the 10-year forecast [for mass-appeal Second Life-style metaverse worlds being 
common in 2016] could be way off.&quot; b <br>
<br>
&bull; Some designers 
assume the superior value of an architecture of contiguous geography in the 
metaverse, transparently connecting spaces, versus archipelagos of loosely 
linked worlds, as we have today. That assumption is yet to be validated, and 
remains a key uncertainty to metaverse development, to be tested in the 
marketplace. What we do know is that for at least the next few game development 
cycles, the bulk of our virtual worlds will continue to be&quot;walled 
gardens&quot; in respect to each other. That is the most conservative business 
strategy at present. c <br>
<br>
&bull; One common but questionable assumption 
is that we are converging toward the emergence of &ldquo;single sign on&rdquo; 
identities either at the governmental, proprietary, or NGO levels. But there 
are major technical complexities and competitive pressures working against such 
projects, and the benefits of interoperability are small, versus the historical 
course of balkanized, pluralistic, competing standards. Previous unification 
efforts (e.g. Microsoft Passport, National ID cards) have been held with high 
suspicion and very low adoption rates. Identity metaguidelines will emerge (see 
Kim Cameron&rsquo;sSeven Laws of Digital Identity [44]), but are likely to grow 
slowly and must compete with the existing network of abstraction layers between 
the user and the world. d <br>
<br>
&bull; With the exception of virtual world 
providers who significantly disrupt, inflate, or otherwise devalue their world, 
we assume the social value of virtual items and currency will be persistent. 
This, in combination with the accelerating popularity of our larger online 
worlds, allows for the accumulation of significant physical world income from 
virtual world activities. e <br>
<br>
&bull; We assume people will invest time 
learning a complex new program interface as long as the payoff is high enough. 
Summit quote: &quot;Millions of people use WoW. It's complex but they do it 
because the payoff is so high. Driving a car is incredibly complex, but we 
don't even question learning because there's so much value.&quot; f <br>
<br>

&bull; Many of us assume that the metaverse is &quot;where the internet was in 
the early/mid 90's,&quot; that it will boom soon. Summit quote: &quot;Where it 
went from being a very small community of white nerds who knew each other to 
being a very large community with a whole lot of interesting spaces.&quot; g 
<br> <br>
&bull; False assumption (myth): &quot;70% of the network traffic on 
the internet is pornography.&quot; This mistaken assumption has been around 
since a 1995<em>Time</em> magazine Cyberporn cover story, but it doesn't hold 
up to analysis. Less than half of one percent of searchable web pages contain 
hard-core porn, inCecil Adam's 2005 estimate [43]. Music, travel, shopping, and 
other subjects take a higher share of internet traffic. As YouTube and other 
internet video sites gain traction, we should expect relative porn volume to 
subside further still. Summit quite: &quot;People get porned out.&quot; h <br>

<p><strong>4C. Assumptions - Social, Legal and Other</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; The metaverse is a shared social space that needs 3D capacity, but 
there are many instances where it will not be 3D. If we try to define the 
metaverse in shorthand as &quot;the 3D web,&quot; we communicate a mistaken 
assumption that the metaverse will be all 3D, or even 3D most of the time, to 
most users. But our most efficient and valuable interfaces for many types of 
communication will long remain 1D and 2D abstractions of a 3D world. Using a 
row of file cabinets in 3D would for many be a reduction of efficiency versus a 
navigating a 2D filing space. People are drawn to many 2D games, like Tetris or 
Puzzle Pirates. Not just for nostalgia, but because the simplicity is elegant, 
focusing, and efficient. 2D online collaboration environments, like WebEx, 
could continue to be more efficient than anything we can create in 3D. 3D 
videoconferencing, which is easily available in many work environments, is used 
today only for special occasions, such as meetings. It would be too distracting 
and disruptive to have on all the time, unless constant visual collaboration 
were necessary. In most cases, certainly in its early years, we will probably 
want to keep Metaversal 3D hidden but available. We&rsquo;ll use it only if it 
doesn&rsquo;t take too much of our system&rsquo;s computing resources, and adds 
significant additional value to the social space. Computing resource load was a 
primary reason thatVRML, a 1990&rsquo;s 3D web protocol, was not able to scale 
beyond a small number of early adopters. More accurately then, we might refer 
to the metaverse as &quot;the 3D enhanced web,&quot; and this roadmap is about 
discovering and forecasting opportunities and challenges to some of the 
enhancement paths.</p> a <br>
<br>
&bull; There is a growing assumption that we 
gravitate to 3D spaces primarily to satisfy our physical world social 
instincts, not for cutting edge virtual realism. If the social content is 
powerful enough, and the interface simple enough, we don&rsquo;t care that the 
graphics are primitive. After a half hour in World of Warcraft or even Second 
Life, you feel you are &ldquo;in&rdquo; the space. As a related observation, we 
note that cartoons with low graphical resolution are compelling even for many 
adults, if the story is interesting. Some of the benefits of social spaces are 
the ability to talk to friends, trade stories, learn, explore, create, and 
engage in economic transactions. In short, a complex and changing set of 
motivations. b <br>
<br>
&bull; We assume that there won't be a significant 
social backlash to people spending increasing amounts of time in virtual 
spaces, and reorganizing their lives to do so. Summit quote: &quot;How much 
time do we expect people to spend in the metaverse? When you look at WoW or SL 
the most interesting stuff comes from people who are almost living in the game, 
and I partly think that's because these worlds are persistent. If you don't 
stay in with your fellow gamers you feel like they're racing ahead.&quot; Even 
if national productivity is not significantly enhanced by virtual worlds in the 
short term, as long is it isn't hurt significantly it may be reasonable to 
assume that social backlash won't slow down the spread of the participatory web.
c <br>
<br>
&bull; &quot;Universal game theory&quot; and the promise and limits 
of 3D games. Some social theorists, philosophers, economists, and game 
theorists, like Herbert Gintis (<em>Moral Sentiments and Material Interests: 
The Foundations of Cooperation in Economic Life</em>, 2005 [46]) contend that 
every role humans engage in, from social roles, to political roles, to athletic 
roles, to business roles, are in fact best understood in the context of games. 
All the elaborate social structures we participate in (stock market, the value 
of our fiat currency, custom, tradition, law) can be formalized as games. If 
this assumption is correct, we may also observe why many types of games are 
best played primarily in &quot;real space&quot; today, as opposed to virtual 
space. It is tempting to believe that many of our current virtual cooperative 
activities (e.g., Wikipedia development, online community, etc.) may better 
engaged in within the immersive environment of a 3D virtual world. But such 
games will be in competition with our existing physical world, and our current 
1D and 2D internet communication technologies. In most cases, given the 
limitations of today's online worlds, including their current non-physicality, 
we can see why non-virtual games will continue to outcompete virtual space for 
most social games for the forseeable future. At the same time, synthetic worlds 
hold the potential, for some, to be more compelling games than those we play in 
the physical world. As we increasingly spend our time there, there's a growing 
responsibility to ensure the rules are fair, the lessons learned are helpful, 
and the result of play is personal empowerment, not addiction and diminishment. 
d <br>
<br>
&bull; The Sports Paradigm may be a good model for the future of 
many virtual worlds. Sports are an analog for life, with clear rules, 
circumscribed conflict immediate if temporary resolutions, highly transparent 
interactions, swift punishment of cheaters, and disproportionate economic and 
social rewards for the victors. In short, a perfect place to amplify the 
lessons learned in conflict and competition as a social game. e <br>
<br>

&bull; TheFrontier Paradigm is an analogy we assume has strong applicability to 
the future of virtual worlds [1]. History tells us that the initial migration 
to geographic frontiers is often led by those who are less enfranchised in 
their prior environment and thus have less to risk and more to gain. There is 
an initial period of wild and lawless experimentation, of seeing what can be 
done with new tools and freedoms in the new environment, followed by eras of 
increasing acclimatization and civilization. Diversity and deviant and mildly 
antisocial behavior can persist and even increase in the civilized world, but 
the effects of this behavior on the whole become increasingly circumscribed. 
You will know a particular metaverse will have arrived when it has healthy 
commercial endeavors, marketing, taxation, and crime. Currently there is an 
early economy (in a few worlds), and minor crime (griefing, farming). f <br>

<br> &bull; Unless otherwise informed, we assume an equivalent permanency, 
consistency, and fairness to the virtual world that we find in the real world. 
Violation of this assumption causes very real mental and emotional effects. g 
<br> <br>
&bull; There is an assumption among some that the people currently at 
the helm of metaverse sectors &quot;see the future&quot; better than others. 
But without adequate diversity, repetition, and depth, we may easily be 
deluding ourselves with our early forays in metaverse foresight development. 
Summit quote: &quot;Our metaverse concepts [in the current foresight community] 
are ethnocentric. Right now it's a small group of people imposing their 
thinking on a culture not yet engaged with these ideas. Right now it's an early 
adopter culture with a lot of geeks in it.&quot; Getting beyond science fiction 
myths to the real dynamics is going to take humility, systematic breadth, and a 
lot more repetitive publicity, analysis, and critique. h <br>
