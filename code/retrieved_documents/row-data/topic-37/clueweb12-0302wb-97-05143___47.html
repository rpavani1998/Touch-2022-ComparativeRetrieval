<p> <strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> is a software toolkit that can be 
integrated into your application to provide a rich 3D PDF publishing 
capability. 3D PDF documents produced using<strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> can 
include a range of graphics, data and dynamic interactive 3D content that 
significantly enriches the communication of intent through the design and 
manufacturing supply chain.</p> 
<p> <strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> uniquely provides you with the same native 
3D PDF technology as used in&nbsp;Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; and Adobe 
Reader&reg;, so 3D PDF documents produced using<strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> 
can be distributed and guaranteed to be viewed using the standard Adobe Reader, 
available on 98% of internet-enabled desktops worldwide.<strong>HOOPS Publish
</strong> 3D PDF documents also take advantage of the security features of the 
Adobe document management technology, ensuring your built-in document 
production capability has the most secure distribution of any documentation 
system.</p> 
<p> Across the manufacturing and construction industries, both individual 
users and enterprises recognize the benefits of 3D PDF and are widely adopting 
it within their engineering document workflows. Tech Soft 3D is a founding 
member of the3D PDF Consortium, an organization comprised of developers, 
software vendors, end users, and standards and governmental organizations, 
dedicated to the ongoing development of 3D PDF and PRC as open standards. By 
integrating<strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> into your application, your products 
can be easily enabled to deliver native-readable 3D PDF documents.</p>  &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<p> <strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> is uniquely based on the native Adobe&reg; 
technologies and is the only software toolkit that offers access to the native 
3D read and write technology used within Acrobat&reg; Reader&reg;. The 3D PDF 
format is an open, data-rich and secure solution for sharing and archiving 3D 
data. By integrating<strong>HOOPS Publish</strong> in your own application, you 
can simply generate 3D PDF documents that can be read by the vast majority of 
the world's desktops. That's building with the best.</p> 
<h3> How can HOOPS Publish benefit you?</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Reads a range of standard format 3D data files.</li> 
<li> Allows publication of rich 3D PDF documents.</li> 
<li> Provides a range of purpose-built&nbsp;3D PDF templates.</li> 
<li> Uniquely provides access to native PDF libraries with no need for extra 
licensing.</li>

Adobe&rsquo;s preferred PRC format. 3D PDF is in the process of becoming the 
standardized 3D file format within PDF/E (Engineering) through ISO 
(International Standardization Organization). The advantage of the PRC format 
is to provide highly accurate and highly compressed format for describing 3D 
CAD models including Assembly Structure, B-Rep, Geometry and product 
manufacturing information (PMI).&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Using <strong>HOOPS Publish</strong>, developers are able to:</p>

<p> Build custom applications using <strong>Autodesk&reg; Inventor&reg; OEM
</strong>&nbsp;to accelerate your engineering development project using a 
world-class OEM software platform.</p> 
<p> <strong>Inventor OEM</strong> combines an intuitive 3D mechanical design 
environment for creating parts and assemblies with specialized design tools 
that enable engineers to focus on design function, not geometry creation. The 
software can drive the automatic design and creation of intelligent components, 
such as plastic parts, steel frames, rotating machinery, tube and pipe runs and 
electrical cable and wire harnesses.</p> 
<p> The inclusion of user-friendly tools for rules-based design automation 
make it easier for design professionals to capture design intent and automate 
common tasks by creating parts that can embed higher levels of design 
intelligence directly into an Inventor digital prototype.</p>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<p> <strong>Autodesk Inventor OEM</strong> is a development platform that 
allows you to create a stand-alone application built on Autodesk Inventor 
technology. The benefit of using Inventor OEM over writing an application that 
runs in Inventor is that you can package your application with Inventor OEM and
<strong>deliver it as your own application</strong>. Your customers don't need 
to know that it is based on Inventor since it is installed using your 
installer, licensed with your licensing, and is branded as your product 
(application name, splash screen, and various other icons), save the 
&quot;Powered By Autodesk Inventor&quot; graphic in the zero-document state.</p>
<p> You can choose to include Inventor commands as-is or create your own 
commands. To create a custom application using Inventor OEM use the Inventor 
API and supply your functionality through an add-in.</p> 
<p> <strong>Autodesk Inventor OEM</strong> is essentially Inventor with 
additional capabilities as detailed below:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> It is modular. Your application might only need to use the 'part 
function'. With Inventor OEM you can choose which components to install; 'part' 
only, 'part' and 'assembly', or 'part', 'assembly', and 'drawing' for example.
</li> 
<li> The branding is configurable so you can define your own application name, 
splash screen, application icons, executable name, etc.</li> 
<li> It is independent of Inventor with regards to shared files and registry 
entries. This means it can be installed on a machine that has Inventor or 
another OEM application.</li> 
<li> It is independent of Autodesk licensing, allowing you to control the 
licensing.</li> </ul>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Sketching</strong></p> 
<p> Evaluate different design ideas before creating detailed part and assembly 
models. Using the Inventor OEM sketch environment, you can quickly capture 
design ideas as versatile 2D layouts. Combining the power of constraints with 
easy-to-use tools for modifying sketches lets you try different design concepts 
and control color and line style, allowing you to find the best way to convey 
your design ideas.</p> 
<p> <strong>Advanced Shape Description</strong></p> 
<p> Create a wide range of complex geometries by easily combining solids and 
surfaces. Inventor OEM gives you precise control of shape characteristics such 
as tangency and continuity. Advanced modeling tools include Loft to a Point, 
N-Sided Patch, Sweep Normal to Surface, Area Loft, Centerline Loft, G2 
Continuous Fillets, Full Round Fillets, and Face-to-Face Fillets</p> 
<p> <strong>Sculpt Tool</strong></p> 
<p> Quickly and easily modify shape details using surfaces from Inventor OEM 
or by incorporating imported surfaces. Construct 3D part geometry from a closed 
set of surfaces, and incorporate imported surface data into the model using the 
Sculpt tool to modify existing parts by adding or removing material.</p> 
<p> <strong>Assembly Design</strong></p> 
<p> Quickly assemble individual parts and subassemblies to define the complete 
product structure. Verify that your product can be assembled. Insert and 
position new components in the assembly, using constraints to capture the 
positional relationships that define fixed and moving components.</p> 
<p> <strong>Large Assembly Performance</strong></p> 
<p> Realize the benefits of 3D design when developing very large assemblies. 
Native shrinkwrap gives you the ability to manage large assemblies by 
converting sub-assemblies into simplified part models or lightweight surface 
models. With level of detail (LOD) representations, you can switch between full 
and lightweight representations to control memory consumption and increase 
performance. A large assembly &ldquo;capacity meter&rdquo; shows you how much 
memory is available.</p> 
<p> <strong>Assembly Configurations </strong></p> 
<p> Easily design and document product families using assembly configurations 
to define variations from a master assembly. Exclude or substitute individual 
components and make changes to dimension and constraint values. Document the 
whole part or assembly configuration using the Table tool, which automatically 
creates the parameter table in a 2D drawing.</p> 
<p> <strong>Plastic Part Design </strong></p> 
<p> Functional plastic features, rule-based fillets and powerful multi-body 
workflows simplify the design of high-quality molded part models.</p> 
<p> <strong>Molded Part Definition </strong></p> 
<p> Make sure molded parts meet aesthetic guidelines for the position of 
parting lines while supporting cost-effective manufacturing requirements. 
Divide the 3D component to define the molded parts, using tools to identify 
silhouette curves for optimum parting plane geometry and multibody operations 
that make it easy to split the part into separate bodies.</p> 
<p> <strong>Sheet Metal Styles</strong></p> 
<p> Generate flat patterns that accurately reflect your manufacturing 
capabilities. Control sheet metal unfolding with styles that define the 
material thickness, bend rules, and corner reliefs. To control the unfolding 
geometry, Inventor software supports linear unfolding, custom unfold equations, 
and custom bend tables.</p>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<p> <strong>Inventor OEM</strong> includes the&nbsp;<strong>iLogic&trade;
</strong> module, which extends and enhances the parametric design capabilities 
of Inventor OEM, automates tedious design tasks, and adds higher levels of 
design intelligence to the production of digital prototypes. With easy-to-use 
authoring capabilities and an intuitive user interface, Inventor OEM iLogic 
integrates seamlessly with Inventor OEM.</p> 
<p> <strong>Using Inventor iLogic you can:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Create smart parts and assemblies that define multiple product 
configurations and make automatic updates in real-time based on logical 
relationships between design parameters such as mass, volume, dimensional 
values, material types, feature and component activation or suppression, 
patterns, and more.</li> 
<li> Simplify rules-based design with easy-to-use, clickable tools that any 
Inventor user working at the individual and engineering workgroup level can use 
&ndash; even those with little or no programming experience.</li> 
<li> Automate tedious design tasks by adding higher than ever before levels of 
intelligence to your digital prototypes.</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>A rules drive&#8203;n design solution</strong></p> 
<p> The iLogic module allows designers and engineers to capture and embed 
engineering and product knowledge directly into virtual models.&nbsp;iLogic 
introduces a design for reuse and automation methodology that is the next 
logical step in parametric modeling.&nbsp;Whereas parametric design allows the 
capturing of design intent, iLogic design in Inventor OEM allows the capture of 
design intelligence and offers the possibility for custom design of standard 
parts.</p> 
<p> <strong>iLogic Highlights</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Uses the power of Autodesk Inventor to capture initial parametric design 
intent. iLogic is used to define the product behaviors, using logimetric rules, 
that result from changing the design input values.</li> 
<li> Provides easy access to powerful design automation functions through a 
simple, user-friendly interface designed for users with little or no 
programming experience.</li> 
<li> Lets users add knowledge to existing designs with full support for iparts 
and iassemblies. Rules can be added to any Inventor part or assembly model 
transforming it into a reusable knowledge asset.</li> 
<li> Extends Inventor&rsquo;s parameter types to include Boolean, string and 
multi-value lists.</li> 
<li> Defines product behavior based on true or false input or property values, 
such as Material type, Mass or even custom properties.</li> 
<li> Allows design and engineering knowledge to be defined and stored as 
iLogic Rule objects that are embedded directly into the models. With iLogic 
there are no new documents to manage!</li> 
<li> Introduces a new way of capturing design intent that goes far beyond what 
can be achieved with only parametric design capability.</li> </ul> 
<p> iLogic enables a rules-driven design for Inventor OEM by equipping CAD 
designers and CAD engineers with an easy-to-use solution seamlessly integrated 
into Inventor OEM.</p>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<p> For each Tech Soft 3D product, licensing and license fees are designed to

<h3>Don't just take our word for it...</h3> 
<p> &ldquo;Project management systems are complex by nature, especially if 
they integrate with 3D design output to create resources that are the basis for 
project planning and delivery. By working with HOOPS Visualize, a huge part of 
our development work was shared - with Synchro resources being re-deployed 
toward enriching our system in other areas that ultimately integrate project 
design timing and cost. &rdquo;</p>
