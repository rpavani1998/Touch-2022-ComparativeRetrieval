<p> Part 1 of this series appeared in the August issue of <em>Java Developer's 
Journal</em> (Vol. 8, issue 8), and Part 2 appeared in the September issue 
(Vol. 8, issue 9).</p>
<p> <strong><em>JDJ: Microsoft has received quite a lot of good press (or 
propaganda, however you'd like to look at it) for their .NET product, and there 
has even been discussion that it will be/is suitable for games development with 
good DirectX bindings. Since Java is only just out of the gate (in terms of 
commercial games development), do you see .NET providing serious competition in 
this burgeoning market, or are there some (perhaps hidden?) advantages to Java 
that might make the difference in this case?</em></strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Jeff K:</strong> Don't confuse .NET the platform with CLR the VM, 
or C# the language.</p>
<p> .NET will <em>not</em> be suitable for games. Its XML-based communications 
protocol is by definition slow and verbose, and that's before you get into the 
other architectural issues. I have no fear of .NET becoming the default 
back-end technology for networked games - it was designed with business apps in 
mind, which need totally different properties.</p>
<p> As for C# and CLR (which, as I understand it, are heavily based on MSVM), 
there are a number of points. MSVM has always supported DirectX through 
JDirect, but it hasn't taken off as a game platform. That they are continuing 
this support doesn't seem like anything new to me. C#/CLR has none of the 
benefits of Java (it's not cross platform, being YADC (yet another dialect of 
C) it's not likely to appreciably improve either productivity or code 
correctness.</p>
<p> About all it does is muddy the waters around Java, which in my opinion is 
maybe all it's supposed to do.</p>
<p> Today we have cross-platform technologies emerging in Java that provide 
all the benefits of DirectX without sacrificing portability, productivity, or 
code correctness. Examples of this are the LWJGL open source library project, 
and the open source bindings for Java to OpenGL (JOGL), OpenAL (JOAL), and 
controller input (JInput).</p>
<p> <strong><em>Doug T: As Jeff mentions, this mostly affects Java from the C# 
side of things. One advantage Java has is time. At GDC this year, there was a 
session on Managed DirectX, which is effectively DirectX for C#, and you could 
have replaced every instance of C# with Java in the presentation. We've been 
solving those problems for years, so we have a head start.</em></strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Cas P:</strong> [Microsoft's] VM technology is currently inferior, 
but not for long. The easy integration with a direct, ultra-capable gaming API 
(DirectX) means that it's only a matter of time before M$ starts gaining a 
majority unless there's some direct competition in the same space from Sun. 
It's my belief that a three-pronged defense - for defense it is, as Java is the 
innocent blinking rabbit in Microsoft's headlights - is needed:<br>
 1.&nbsp; 
Gang together with game technologies, embrace and flourish - OpenGL and OpenAL 
are Sun's only hope against DirectX, so they'd better start supporting it, 
encouraging it, sponsoring it, and even helping it. If Sun is seen to be behind 
OpenGL to the point where their own products utterly depended on it, you'd get 
the positive feedback loop required to ensure that both support each other and 
grow.<br>
 2.&nbsp; Actively put major resources into the gaming space, gain 
the confidence of developers by being seen to do this, and start listening more 
keenly to suggestions and being a little more open about what's being done to 
address issues. I think we need a dedicated engineering, marketing, and support 
team for the whole issue, yet I feel that Jeff and Chris are the only Sun 
employees who are even trying, and they only seem to be let out of their 
cubicles once they've said their prayers to Solaris and flayed themselves for 
eight hours over a hot spreadsheet.<br>
 3.&nbsp; Hardware assault - the big, 
big question: Is there room for a Java-based console, and if not, why not? 
Perhaps Sun could even fund it by running it on a Sparc chip. If there's no 
room for a Java-based console, then truly Java is failing as the games platform 
of choice because it's the best place it could possibly be from a developer's 
perspective.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Erik D: I think the problem with .NET is that you are 
specifically choosing Microsoft and Microsoft alone and, in effect, you 
explicitly exclude a large market potential.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> There's no way .NET will become available on a PlayStation, 
for example. Of course, we also have no Java (yet?) on PS, so currently 
development will stick to C++.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> Java does have a longer history than .NET and has proven 
itself in many more ways than .NET has, such as the obvious platform 
independence. If Java did spread to PS3 and XBOX, I'd say &quot;why C# and 
stick with PCs if we already have Java?&quot; if I were a development company.
</em></strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Shawn K:</strong> I do see serious competition from this because 
MS will do whatever it can to move developers to Windows, games or otherwise. 
It doesn't matter if C#/.NET isn't exactly Java. They listen to their 
developers and changes get made. The fact that MS will make .NET work on the 
XBox and future XBoxes makes it all the more compelling.</p>
<p> Also, MS makes games. They make one C# game that's a hit and it's a done 
deal. Developers and publishers will look at C#, and the same dynamic I stated 
before. The only advantages for Java that I can see right now are:<br>
 
1.&nbsp; Huge existing developer base and knowledge base.<br>
 2.&nbsp; Deep 
desire in game developers not to use MS stuff. That is a true phenomenon. Many 
working game developers I have talked to will try anything that is not MS tech.
</p>
<p> I would like to point out some major disadvantages as well.<br>
 1.&nbsp; 
Licensing issues<br>
 2.&nbsp; Media APIs </p>
<p> <strong><em>JDJ: I know some of you are currently developing 3D games 
using Java. What was the reasoning behind your particular approach? Part 2 of 
this question is: Do you have any regrets? Are there any benefits to another 
approach that you wish you could take advantage of?</em></strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Cas P:</strong> First a quick mention about LWJGL. LWJGL is a 
modest library, still in development, and it aims to do very little other than 
to do things Java can't, like draw with OpenGL. There is a frequently 
misunderstood purpose to the library though. LWJGL is not an add-on library to 
J2SE to allow you to write OpenGL applications in Java. It was designed from 
the very beginning to be a portable console game library, even if it does end 
up being only completely theoretical. There's only one window in LWJGL, and we 
get a lot of requests for multiple windows. You can't even insist on a title 
bar and windowed mode; it's specifically meant to provide full screen-only 
games. We get a lot of requests to enable one to create lots of windows and 
have them behave as they should. But then it wouldn't run on a console, would 
it? We've deliberately created a platform based around what we know the 
hardware and underlying O/S need to be for gaming: a display, some speakers, a 
few input devices - nothing more.</p>
<p> A side effect of LWJGL is it enables us to deploy games with less 
licensing restrictions: I can natively compile my games for Windows, which 
solves a bunch of other problems I won't go into here, and the demos come out 
under the magic 5MB download patience threshold.</p>
<p> I developed LWJGL in the first place because I find the OpenGL API easy 
and, most important, fast. Java 3D is so far above my head I barely know where 
to begin. This is the problem a lot of developers have with Java 3D. If you 
want to learn 3D programming, Java 3D isn't the thing for you.</p>
<p> The other reason for LWJGL was simplicity. It's a platform; there's a 
specification to program to. It's a bit vague right now because we're only in 
alpha, but it removes a lot of uncertainty and hassle. I discovered Alien Flux 
ran on Linux without any trouble at all. I was more surprised than anyone. Once 
it's up and running, it behaves in exactly the same way as the Windows one. You 
wouldn't know you were running Linux underneath it because it's full screen. I 
have the same hope for PlayStation 3 one day. You'd never know it was written 
for the PC because all the developer has to use is an empty black screen, some 
speakers, and three input devices, not all of which will even be present.</p>
<p> Another reason for LWJGL is performance - speed and size. I can write 
absolutely optimized code for LWJGL and it runs in hardly any memory. Alien 
Flux would even run on a PlayStation's 32MB of RAM with a little tweaking to 
the graphics. There are no caveats with regard to performance; all the 
knowledge about performance is from OpenGL, so it's very widely understood. If 
you write a slow LWJGL game, it's because you've used OpenGL incorrectly, not 
because we've written some dicky code in the library.</p>
<p> And no regrets. Not for one moment do I think I could have done it easier 
or better with any other technology. GL4Java, Direct3D, Java 3D - they're all 
deeply flawed when it comes to writing portable games in Java. My only real 
regret is that it's unlikely that we'll ever be endorsed by Sun. Although if I 
may make a prediction here: LWJGL is very likely to become the driving factor 
in Java games development.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Jeff K: In terms of using OGL incorrectly, that may be true 
for relatively simple games, but I'm not sure it carries into the A-lines games 
of today. OGL doesn't give you scene graph management; you're going to need to 
write that yourself. It doesn't give you physics; again you're going to have to 
code that. My guess is that you've covered about half of the core graphics 
issues with OGL, or about 5% of that 10% I talked about earlier. For some folks 
that may be the perfect bar, for others it may be too low. However, all that 
being said, I do agree that being able to directly write to OGL is a good thing 
regardless of what you do on the top of it.</em></strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Erik D:</strong> I'm not married to LWJGL &quot;till death do us 
part&quot; or anything, but I do have a love affair with it because I like the 
low-level approach. It doesn't restrict me in any way and I believe it might 
become a key factor for well-performing games written in Java.</p>
<p> I've been playing a little with J3D, but I thought OpenGL was a lot easier 
to get into, and I like keeping in full control of things. Personally, I don't 
like the idea of J3D completely hiding details; of course, this isn't fully 
justified because I haven't done much with J3D, but I do strongly believe you 
should always be able to get as low level as necessary where games development 
is concerned and I've seen people struggle with J3D issues that they don't seem 
to be in control of.</p>
<p> If J3D had been built on top of an OpenGL wrapper, I'd probably have used 
that because it obviously addresses the problem of LWJGL, that there aren't any 
scene graph implementations available for it yet.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Shawn K: One point I'd like to bring to light is the scene 
graph versus immediate mode argument. We have to remember that Java 3D is 
implementing a scene graph, and Java/OGL is simply immediate mode access 
through Java. There are pros and cons to both and they're completely 
independent of Java and Java 3D. That argument has waged on for generations.
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> We chose J3D for several reasons.<br>
 1.&nbsp; Ease of use. I 
never want to code immediate mode graphics if I can help it. It's like assembly 
for graphics. I use a high-level language and a high-level graphics system. I 
have also used scene graphs (from SGI to PC) outside of Java and plan to keep 
on doing so. Eventually the class I teach adopted RenderWare (a pseudo-scene 
graph API) once it was an acceptable practice.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> One problem, due to the high level and ease of use, is that 
developers think they can make great 3D graphics projects and not know anything 
about 3D graphics. Sometimes the questions that are posted on the J3D list are 
atrocious. OGL is so low level you have to have a bit better programming skill 
as well as more 3D knowledge to use it. I experience this in my courses as 
well. The point being, when you know what you're doing, a scene graph or 
immediate mode are both great tools. When you don't know, a scene graph is a 
lot easier.<br>
 2.&nbsp; Scene management. Just like some LWJGL users are 
finding, eventually you have to build a scene graph anyway for any scene bigger 
than a bread basket.<br>
 3.&nbsp; Common data structures for public as well as 
private interchange. By this I mean, there's a thriving community of developers 
who code to J3D and easily trade huge code packages because they all use J3D 
classes and can be tested and integrated with very little modifications if 
written well. I'm not saying those actual packages will end up in a final 
production, but the integration-to-test phase is lightning fast. If all these 
developers were using OGL wrappers, the exchange would be close to nothing.</em>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><em> Look at the OpenGL community as it is. There's a lot of 
trading but it is all techniques and code &quot;snippets,&quot; not loaders and 
behaviors or even collision systems because each OGL developer has his or her 
own scene graph equivalent structure on top of OGL that they will have to 
translate to for any techniques and code they get from the outside world.<br>
 
4.&nbsp; Better cross-platform than OGL alone. We used Java/J3D for a long time 
as a true cross-platform solution. Our students' laptops ran best under 
DirectX, and our classroom workstations under OpenGL. For their work it was no 
problem to use either install and everything worked. This is less of an issue 
today as the laptops have better support for OGL and the workstations for 
DirectX. The current Java/OGL world is still an OGL on Linux/Solaris/Windows 
world so J3D has a slight edge there.<br>
 5.&nbsp; Legacy. It was the only way 
to do 3D in Java at the time we started.</em></strong> </p>
