Solutions &gt; Software &gt; Direct3D 10/11 Natively Implemented on Linux <br>

<h1>Direct3D 10/11 Natively Implemented on Linux</h1>  8:00 AM - September 27, 
2010 by Marcus Yam - source: Tom's Hardware US <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Direct3D touted as better than OpenGL on Linux.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Gamers on Linux are used to there being a limited choice of 3D APIs. OpenGL 
is an excellent cross-platform solution, but a lot of development these days 
are on Direct3D &ndash; which is from Microsoft and obviously not on Mac OS X 
or Linux. Well, not on Linux until this week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Luca Barbieri made a commit with news of native Direct3D 10/11 support into 
Gallium, with an eventual goal of running Windows games in Wine.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;The primary goal is to realize Gallium's promise of multiple API 
support, and provide an API that can be easily implemented with just a very 
thin wrapper over Gallium, instead of the enormous amount of complex code 
needed for OpenGL,&quot; wrote Barbieri. &quot;The secondary goal is to run 
Windows Direct3D 10/11 games on Linux using Wine.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>He added, &quot;Thanks to a very clean and well-though design done from 
scratch, the Direct3D 10/11 APIs are vastly better than OpenGL and can be 
supported with orders of magnitude less code and development time, as you can 
see by comparing the lines of code of this commit and those in the existing 
Mesa OpenGL implementation.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For those worried that Direct3D 10/11 won't have the same kind of 
performance as OpenGL, Barbieri said, &quot;Finally, a mature Direct3D 10/11 
implementation is intrinsically going to be faster and more reliable than an 
OpenGL implementation, thanks to the dramatically smaller API and the 
segregation of all nontrivial work to object creation that the application must 
perform ahead of time.&quot;</p>

Hmm.. 
lose Windows in favor of DirectX 10 and 11 on linux? IT'S MICROSOFT'S API! 
Microsoft isn't going to just make an API so people can reap it's benefits in 
Linux. There will always be Windows and there will always be Linux, for now. I 
am currently using Linux and hearing this definitely adds hope for the Linux 
community.<br>

They do 
&quot;support it&quot;, it's the other way around actually. Manufacturers have 
to provide drivers for their HW to be &quot;supported&quot;. And in Linux 
almost every piece of HW is supported thanks to the &quot;community&quot; 
behind different distros and/or groups.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's not mature at all 
and we're still a few months away before we can see Wine trying it out in an 
alpha/beta state. They're still working on the driver side I think.<br>
<br>

<p>&quot;not on Linux until this week&quot; -- except that it's still not 
released and WINE has been trying to run Windows apps on Linux for something 
like 12 years and, as far as I am aware, they still aren't 100% compatible apps 
written for the initial Windows 95 release much less DirectX 11.</p> scryer_360

<p>Funny .. the windows guys accept the linux guys with ease and look at them 
with indifference .. but the linux looks so full of itself .. oh gosh how bad 
windows is, let`s kill the big bad wolf, they charge us money for the OS.. 
(well shoot the clerk that seels you bread at the local store for charing you 
money for it). Or look we are bright enough that we can install a program 
trough command line in linux ... seriously .. me personally i have no use at 
all of linux and will never be a part of my OS. The thing that Linux users 
never got to understand is that the market has room for bouth of them, and that 
there are loads of ppl like me that are very pleased with their windows and 
will never even look at a linux platform. And i find it extremely funny how 
linux tries to be a windows, i mean ok let`s dump the command line installers 
let`s do it more user friendly like windows has, let`s make the menus look more 
like windows for users to transition with ease, let`s install DX from windows 
in linux ... what will be next that they`ll take from windows ?</p> JOSHSKORN

Linux on PS3<br>

DirectX on Linux<br>

<p>OpenGL is NOT an excellent cross-platform API, although it may have been 
one day.<br>
It's counter-intuitive to code, performs worse and lacks features 
than D3D.<br>
<br>
Major developers (ID etc) are using D3D even though they 
don't like being locked to Windows, simply because it is far superior to OpenGL.
<br><br>
What we need is more competition, a newcomer 3D API (or many of them), 
designed from scratch. But that'd require hardware vendors to open their APIs.
<br><br>
You can't create a new 3D API at present unless you implement a 
translation layer to either GL or D3D. It'd be like trying to write a new 
language or even a new compiler if the X86 spec was secret.<br>
<br>
So we're 
stuck with a crappy duopoly of inferior vs proprietary.<br>
<br>
Why aren't we 
breaking down doors and writing laws forcing these companies to release their 
API specs so we can write better software for them?</p> feeddagoat  09/27/2010

<br>
The cost 
associated to develop on a different API is too high. OpenGL and DirectX its 
enough.<br>
Microsoft works hard with the gaming industry and the vendors, the 
competition come from the consoles. So the evolution is good on this side.<br>

and OpenGL and DirectX are really close, from feature and performance point of 
view. and both are correctly supported by the GPU and the drivers. So its false 
to say DirectX is far superior.<br>

It's 
actually a very important thing to MS... You could fine tune your PC to a point 
where you would get monster performance loading exactly what you need from the 
boot loader. A special kernel with gallium + X (if needed at all) + drivers for 
networking/pads/etc and a GUI to select the game.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
If so then just pick one. Nobody's forcing 
you to support all compatible APIs. Most games only support 1 right now.<br>

<br>The only added cost is to the API designer. Game devs etc can only have 
things either as good (stick with GL and/or D3D) or better (a new API becomes 
better than those two).<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
We're 
talking about API competition. The console manufacturers can't pick anything 
other than GL or D3D.<br>
While it's better than just having 1, a duopoly is 
still not very competitive. And for all of us that don't use MS, it's been a 
monopoly.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
Well I don't know much about D3D since I write for linux, 
but when ID etc switch away from the open software they support there must be a 
major advantage, and I don't think they're selling out to Microsoft.<br>
<br>

OpenGL has had slack periods recently (eg the 3.0 debacle where they dragged on 
forever then deleted most of the improvements developers were waiting on).<br>

<br> <br>
But this might all be moot sometime soon. <br>
Graphics cards are 
getting flexible enough you can almost program a fast rendering engine yourself 
instead of using the standard rendering pathway.

<br>

<br>
As I understand 
it, and I may be wrong, but MS doesn't have a choice. APIs can't be patented. 
The implementation on the other hand may have patentable components. That's why 
Wine developers have steered clear of re-implementing the same API features and 
why it's difficult to get many games working through Wine.<br>

People 
will not just up and leave Windows. i dare say a number of people here who are 
saying that they will ditch Windows just as soon as they can run games on Linux 
will come crying back to Windows within a couple of hours.Linux is not Windows, 
and requires a different way of thinking and doing things. It isfundamentally 
different to Windows.<br>
<br>
<b>ohim :</b><br>
Funny .. the windows guys 
accept the linux guys with ease and look at them with indifference<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> <br>
<br>
I beg to differ, and I'm a &quot;windows guy&quot; (actually I 
use and appreciate both, but use Windows more often at the moment) There are 
alot of arrogant Windows fanboys who, firstly, don't have much of an 
understanding about theirown operating system, and secondly don't have a clue 
about Linux either, but pretend that they do. You appear to be one of these 
people, but it's a very big group so don't feel too bad.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
See now this is a very common statement by somebody 
who doesn't understand the concept of libre software. Not all Linux users have 
an issue with the price of anything (except that they can fulfil their needs 
without cost).You can sell Linux distros that are freely downloadable and you 
are not discouraged from doing so. FOSS is about free as in freedom, not free 
beer. I'm sure you've heard that said ad nauseum, but you obviously still don't 
understand it.<br>
<br>
<b>ohim :</b><br>
there are loads of ppl like me that 
are very pleased with their windows and will never even look at a linux 
platform.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then why on earth are you trying to make 
an argument about Linux or Linux users if you've never even looked at it? 
Obviously you are pleased with what you have. You've never used anything else 
to know if you're using the right tool for the job (OSs are just tools after 
all, and you should always use the best tool for you, not for someone else)<br>

<br> <b>ohim :</b><br>
And i find it extremely funny how linux tries to be a 
windows<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is probably the most ignorant 
statement in your entire post and shows your complete and utter lack of 
understanding.<br>
<br>
<b>ohim :</b><br>
i mean ok let`s dump the command line 
installers<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Most distributions do not use a pure 
command line for installing the base system, but many still use a text-based 
installer. Further configuration is often entirely on the command-line. Ever 
tried Arch Linux? Debian Testing perhaps? OH no, you haven't even looked at 
Linux, I forgot.<br>
<br>
<b>ohim :</b><br>
let`s do it more user friendly like 
windows has<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;User friendly&quot; is a term 
used interchangeably with &quot;what I'm used to&quot; and therefore Windows is 
only user friendly because it is what you are used to. &quot;User 
friendly&quot; is probably one of the most meaningless terms ever created to 
discuss a user interface design. There are billions of potential users. Which 
user do you refer to when you say &quot;user friendly&quot;? Which user is the 
interface being friendly to? Me? You? A systems administrator? A 90-year-old 
woman in a nursing home?<br>

let`s make the menus look 
more like windows for users to transition with ease<br>

I haven't really seen any major distribution that looks like Windows. But even 
if there was one, how at all does this represent the goals of &quot;Linux&quot; 
(which is, at its most broad definition, simply the kernel and GNU toolchain). 
Did Windows copy the X Window System (which Linux distros typically use) which 
pre-dated it? After all, Windows is a late comer to the GUI arena.<br>

case you missed the link I posted earlier, I'll provide it again:

That article is 5-6 years old, 
and yet amazingly the dead horse still gets beaten to a pulp with the same old 
arguments from the same people who have no idea about anything outside of their 
Zone of Familiarity.
