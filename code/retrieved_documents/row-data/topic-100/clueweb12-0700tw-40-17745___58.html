<h3> Backing up your&nbsp;email </h3>  Filed under: Miscellaneous &mdash; 
Steve Ferg @ 10:17 pm<br>

<p>Just in case someone might find this useful &hellip;</p> 
<p>I recently had something bad happen to me. I use Thunderbird (on Windows 
Vista) as my email client. I asked Thunderbird to compact my email files, and 
it wiped out a bunch of my email messages. (I think that one of my email files 
must have been corrupt, and when I compacted it, the compaction process wiped 
out messages that should not have been wiped out.)</p> 
<p>You can recover deleted email messages &hellip; but not after the email 
file has been compacted. So the messages were not recoverable. Bummer.</p> 
<p>The upside is that this nasty incident led me to learn some things. </p> 
<p>One thing that I learned was that the disk backup utility that I was using 
at the time did NOT backup my email files. The email files were stored in a 
directory called AppData, and the AppData directory is a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; 
directory. So the backup utility didn&rsquo;t see the AppData directory, and 
didn&rsquo;t back it up. So I had no backup of the deleted messages.</p> 
<p>Learning that led me to investigate ways to backup my email files, and I 
found this:Five ways to keep your emails backed up</p> 
<p>For backing up Thunderbird files, it recommends MozBackup as being fast, 
free and easy to use. So I tried MozBackup, and those claims seem to be true.
</p> 
<p>Now I&rsquo;m evaluating different disk backup options.</p> 
<p>The take-away here is that <strong>you need to pay special attention to 
backing up your email files.</strong> So if you&rsquo;re not backing up your 
email files, take a look atFive ways to keep your emails backed up (and read 
the comments, which are useful) or google something like&ldquo;email 
backup&rdquo;. </p> 
<p>[Note that this applies only if you are using an email client such as 
Thunderbird, Outlook, Outlook Express, etc. If you don't use an email client, 
and do all of your email work through a Web interface to your Internet Service 
Provider, then this is not an issue.]</p> Comments (1) <br>

<h3> Unicode for dummies &mdash;&nbsp;Encoding </h3>  Filed under: Unicode 
&mdash; Steve Ferg @ 2:03 pm<br>

<p><em>Another entry in an irregular series of posts about Unicode.</em><br>

<em>Typos fixed 2012-02-22. Thanks Anonymous, and Clinton, for reporting the 
typos.</em></p> 
<p>This is a story about encoding and decoding, with a minor subplot involving 
Unicode.</p> 
<p>As our story begins &mdash; on a dark and stormy night, of course &mdash; 
we find our protagonist deep in thought. He is asking himself &ldquo;What is an 
encoding?&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>What is an encoding?</strong></p> 
<p>The basic concepts are simple. First, we start with the idea of a piece of 
information &mdash; a message &mdash; that exists in a representation that is 
understandable (perspicuous) to a human being. I&rsquo;m going to call that 
representation &ldquo;plain text&rdquo;. For English-language speakers, for 
example, English words printed on a page, or displayed on a screen, count as 
plain text.</p> 
<p>Next, (for reasons that we won&rsquo;t explore right now) we need to be 
able to translate a message in a plain-text representation into some other 
representation (let&rsquo;s call that representation the &ldquo;encoded 
text&rdquo;), and we need to be able to translate the encoded text back into 
plain text. The translation from plain text to encoded text is called 
&ldquo;encoding&rdquo;, and the translation of encoded text back into plain 
text is called &ldquo;decoding&rdquo;.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There are three points worth noting about this process. </p> 
<p><strong>The first point</strong> is that no information can be lost during 
encoding or decoding. It must be possible for us to send a message on a 
round-trip journey &mdash; from plain text to encoded text, and then back again 
from encoded text to plain text &mdash; and get back exactly the same plain 
text that we started with. That is why, for instance, we can&rsquo;t use one 
natural language (Russian, Chinese, French, Navaho) as an encoding for another 
natural language (English, Hindi, Swahili). The mappings between natural 
languages are too loose to guarantee that a piece of information can make the 
round-trip without losing something in translation.</p> 
<p>The requirement for a lossless round-trip means that the mapping between 
the plain text and the encoded text must be very tight, very exact. And that 
brings us to<strong>the second point</strong>.</p> 
<p>In order for the mapping between the plain text and the encoded text to be 
very tight &mdash; which is to say: in order for us to be able to specify very 
precisely how the encoding and decoding processes work &mdash; we must specify 
very precisely what the plain text representation looks like.</p> 
<p>Suppose, for example, we say that plain text looks like this: the 26 
upper-case letters of the Anglo-American alphabet, plus the space and three 
punctuation symbols: period (full stop), question mark, and dash (hyphen). This 
gives us a plain-text alphabet of 30 characters. If we need numbers, we can 
spell them out, like this: &ldquo;SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-THREE&rdquo;.
</p> 
<p>On the other hand, we may wish to say that our plain text looks like this: 
26 upper-case letters, 26 lower-case letters, 10 numeric digits, the space 
character, and a dozen types of punctuation marks: period, comma, double-quote, 
left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and so on. That gives us a plain-text 
alphabet of 75 characters.</p> 
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve specified exactly what a plain-text representation of a 
message looks like &mdash; a finite sequence of characters from our 
30-character alphabet, or perhaps our 75-character alphabet &mdash; then we can 
devise a system (a code) that can reliably encode and decode plain-text 
messages written in that alphabet. The simplest such system is one in which 
every character in the plain-text alphabet has one and only one corresponding 
representation in the encoded text. A familiar example is Morse code, in which 
&ldquo;SOS&rdquo; in plain text corresponds to</p> 
<pre> ... --- ...</pre> 
<p>in encoded text.</p> 
<p>In the real world, of course, the selection of characters for the 
plain-text alphabet is influenced by technological limitations on the encoded 
text. Suppose we have several available technologies for storing encoded 
messages: one technology supports an encoded alphabet of 256 characters, 
another technology supports only 128 encoded characters, and a third technology 
supports only 64 encoded characters. Naturally, we can make our plain-text 
alphabet much larger if we know that we can use a technology that supports a 
larger encoded-text alphabet.</p> 
<p>And the reverse is also true. If we know that our plain-text alphabet must 
be very large, then we know that we must find &mdash; or devise &mdash; a 
technology capable of storing a large number of encoded characters.</p> 
<p>Which brings us to Unicode.</p> 
<p><strong>Unicode</strong></p> 
<p>Unicode was devised to be a system capable of storing encoded 
representations of every plain-text character of every human language that has 
ever existed. English, French, Spanish. Greek. Arabic. Hindi. Chinese. Assyrian 
(cuneiform characters).</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of characters.</p> 
<p>So the first task of the Unicode initiative was simply to list all of those 
characters, and count them. That&rsquo;s the first half of Unicode, the
Universal Character Set. (And if you really want to &ldquo;talk Unicode&rdquo;, 
don&rsquo;t call plain-text characters &ldquo;characters&rdquo;. Call them 
&ldquo;code points&rdquo;.)</p> 
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, you&rsquo;ve got to figure out a technology 
for storing all of the corresponding encoded-text characters. (In 
Unicode-speak, the encoded-text characters are called &ldquo;code 
values&rdquo;.)</p> 
<p>In fact Unicode defines not one but several methods of mapping code points 
to code values. Each of these methods has its own name. Some of the names start 
with &ldquo;UTF&rdquo;, others start with &ldquo;UCS&rdquo;: UTF-8, UTF-16, 
UTF-32, UCS-2, UCS-4, and so on. The naming convention is &ldquo;UTF-&lt;number 
of bits in a code value&gt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;UCS-&lt;number of bytes in a code 
value&gt;&rdquo; Some (e.g. UCS-4 and UTF-32) are functionally equivalent. See 
theWikipedia article on Unicode.</p> 
<p>The most important thing about these methods is that some are fixed-width 
encodings and some are variable-width encodings. The basic idea is that the 
fixed-width encodings are very long &mdash; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are 4 bytes (32 
bits) long &mdash; long enough to hold the the biggest code value that we will 
ever need.</p> 
<p>In contrast, the variable-width encodings are designed to be short, but 
expandable. UTF-8, for example, can use as few as 8 bits (one byte) to store 
Latin and ASCIIcharacters code points. But it also has a sort of 
&ldquo;continued on the next byte&rdquo; mechanism that allows it to use 2 
bytes or even 4 bytes if it needs to (as it might, for Chinese characters). For 
Western programmers, that means that UTF-8 is both efficient and flexible, 
which is why UTF-8 is the de facto standardard encoding for exchanging Unicode 
text.</p> 
<p>There is, then, no such thing as THE Unicode encoding system or method. 
There are<em>several</em> encoding methods, and if you want to exchange text 
with someone, you need explicitly to specify which encoding method you are 
using.</p> 
<p>Is it, say, this.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Or this.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Or something else.</p> 
<p>Which brings us back to something I said earlier. </p> 
<p><strong>Why encode something in Unicode?</strong></p> 
<p>At the beginning of this post I said</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We start with the idea of a piece of information &mdash; a message &mdash; 
that exists in a representation that is understandable (perspicuous) to a human 
being.</p> 
<p>Next, (for reasons that we won&rsquo;t explore right now) we need to be 
able to translate a message in a plain-text representation into some other 
representation. The translation from plain text to encoded text is called 
&ldquo;encoding&rdquo;, and the translation of encoded text back into plain 
text is called &ldquo;decoding&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>OK. So now it is time to explore those reasons. Why might we want to 
translate a message in a plain-text representation into some other 
representation?</p> 
<p>One reason, of course, is that we want to keep a secret. We want to hide 
the plain text of our message by<em>encrypting </em>and <em>decrypting </em>it 
&mdash; basically, by keeping the algorithms for encoding and decoding secret 
and private.</p> 
<p>But that is a completely different subject. Right now, we&rsquo;re not 
interested in keeping secrets; we&rsquo;re Python programmers and we&rsquo;re 
interested in Unicode. So:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>Why &mdash; as a Python programmer &mdash; would I need to be able to 
translate a plain-text message into some encoded representation&hellip; say, a 
Unicode representation such as UTF-8?</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>Suppose you are happily sitting at your PC, working with your favorite text 
editor, writing the standard Hello World program in Python (specifically, in 
Python 3+). This single line is your entire program.</p> 
<pre> print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) </pre> 
<p>Here, &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; is plain text. You can see it on your 
screen. You can read it. You know what it means. It is just a string and you 
can (if you wish) do standard string-type operations on it, such as taking a 
substring (a slice).</p> 
<p>But now suppose you want to put this string &mdash; &ldquo;Hello, 
world!&rdquo; &mdash; into a file and save the file on your hard drive. Perhaps 
you plan to send the file to a friend.</p> 
<p>That means that you must eject your poor little string from the warm, 
friendly, protected home in your Python program, where it exists simply as 
plain-text characters. You must thrust it into the cold, impersonal, outside 
world of the file system. And out there it will exist not as characters, but as 
mere 1&prime;s and 0&prime;s, a jumble of dits and dots, charged and uncharged 
particles. And that means that your happy little plain-text string must be 
represented<em>by some specific configuration of 1s and 0s</em>, so that when 
somebody wants to retrieve that collection of 1s and 0s and convert it back 
into readable plain text, they can.</p> 
<p>The process of converting a plain text into a specific configuration of 1s 
and 0s is a process of<em>encoding</em>. In order to write a string to a file, 
you must encode it using some encoding system (such as UTF-8). And to get it 
back from a file, you must read the file and decode the collection of 1s and 0s 
back into plain text.</p> 
<p>The need to encode/decode strings when writing/reading them from/to files 
isn&rsquo;t something new &mdash; it is not an additional burden imposed by 
Python 3&prime;s new support for Unicode. It is something you have always done. 
But it wasn&rsquo;t always so obvious. In earlier versions of Python, the 
encoding scheme wasASCII. And because, in those olden times, ASCII was pretty 
much the only game in town, you didn&rsquo;t need to specify that you wanted to 
write and read your files in ASCII. Python just assumed it by default and did 
it. But &mdash; whether or not you realized it &mdash; whenever one of your 
programs wrote or read strings from a file, Python was busy behind the scene, 
doing the encoding and decoding for you.</p> 
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you &mdash; as a Python programmer &mdash; need to be 
able to encode and decode text into, and out of, UTF-8 (or some other encoding: 
UTF-16, ASCII, whatever). You need to encode your strings as 1s and 0s so you 
can put those 1s and 0s into a file and send the file to someone else.</p> 
<p><strong>What is plain text?</strong></p> 
<p>Earlier, I said that there were three points worth noting about the 
encoding/decoding process, and I discussed the first two. Here is<strong>the 
third point</strong>.</p> 
<p>The distinction between plain text and encoded text is relative and 
context-dependent.</p> 
<p>As programmers, we think of plain text as being written text. But it is 
possible to look at matters differently. For instance, we can think of spoken 
text as the plain text, and written text as the encoded text. From this 
perspective, writing is encoded speech. And there are many different encodings 
for speech as writing. Think of Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan hieroglyphics, 
the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, Arabic, Chinese ideograms, wonderfully 
flowingDevanagari &#2342;&#2375;&#2357;&#2344;&#2366;&#2327;&#2352;&#2368;, 
sharp pointy cuneiform wedges, even shorthand. These are all written encodings 
for the spoken word. They are all, as Thomas Hobbes put it, &ldquo;Marks by 
which we may remember our thoughts&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Which reminds us that, in a different context, even speech itself &mdash; 
language &mdash; may be regarded as a form of encoding. In much of early modern 
philosophy (think of Hobbes and Locke) speech (or language) was basically 
considered to be an encoding of thoughts and ideas. Communication happens when 
I encode my thought into language and say something &mdash; speak to you. You 
hear the sound of my words and decode it back into ideas. We achieve 
communication when I successfully transmit a thought from my mind to your mind 
via language. You understand me when &mdash; as a result of my speech &mdash; 
you have the<em>same</em> idea in your mind as I have in mine. (See Ian Hacking,
<em>Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?</em>)</p> 
<p>Finally, note that in other contexts, the &ldquo;plain text&rdquo; 
isn&rsquo;t even text. Where the plain text is soundwaves (e.g. music), it can 
be encoded as an mp3 file. Where the plain text is an image, it can be encoded 
as a gif, or png, or jpg file. Where the plain text is a movie, it can be 
encoded as a wmv file. And so on.</p> 
<p>Everywhere, we are surrounded by encoding and decoding.</p> 
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d like to recommend Eli Bendersky&rsquo;s recent post on The 
bytes/str dichotomy in Python 3, which prodded me &mdash; finally &mdash; to 
put these thoughts into writing. I especially like this passage in his post.</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Think of it this way: a string is an abstract representation of text. A 
string consists of characters, which are also abstract entities not tied to any 
particular binary representation. When manipulating strings, we&rsquo;re living 
in blissful ignorance. We can split and slice them, concatenate and search 
inside them. We don&rsquo;t care how they are represented internally and how 
many bytes it takes to hold each character in them. We only start caring about 
this when encoding strings into bytes (for example, in order to send them over 
a communication channel), or decoding strings from bytes (for the other 
direction).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I strongly recommend Charles Petzold&rsquo;s wonderful book <em>Code: The 
Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.</em></p> 
<p>And finally, I&rsquo;ve found Stephen Pincock&rsquo;s <em>Codebreaker: The 
History of Secret Communications</em> a delightful read. It will tell you, 
among many other things, how the famous WWII Navaho codetalkers could talk 
about submarines and dive bombers&hellip; despite the fact that there are no 
Navaho words for &ldquo;submarine&rdquo; or &ldquo;dive bomber&rdquo;.</p>

<h3> How to post source code on&nbsp;WordPress </h3>  Filed under: 
Miscellaneous &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 12:46 pm <br>

<p><em>This post is for folks who blog about Python (or any programming 
language for that matter) on WordPress.</em><br>
<em>Updated 2011-11-09 to make 
it easier to copy-and-paste the<code>[<em></em>sourcecode]</code> template.</em>
</p> 
<p>My topic today is <strong>How to post source code on WordPress.</strong></p>
<p>The trick is to use the WordPress <strong>[<em></em>sourcecode]</strong> 
shortcut tag, as documented at
http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/.</p> 
<p>Note that when the WordPress docs tell you to enclose the <strong>[<em></em>
sourcecode]</strong> shortcut tag in square &mdash; not pointy &mdash; 
brackets, they mean it. When you view your post<em>as HTML</em>, what you 
should see is square brackets around the shortcut tags, not pointy brackets.</p>
<p>Here is the tag I like to use for snippets of Python code.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre> [<em></em>sourcecode language=&quot;python&quot; 
wraplines=&quot;false&quot; collapse=&quot;false&quot;] your source code goes 
here [<em></em>/sourcecode] </pre> </blockquote> 
<p>The default for <strong>wraplines </strong>is <strong>true</strong>, which 
causes long lines to be wrapped. That isn&rsquo;t appropriate for Python, so I 
specify<strong>wraplines=&rdquo;false&rdquo;</strong>.</p> 
<p>The default for <strong>collapse</strong> is <strong>false</strong>, which 
is what I normally want. But I code it explicitly, as a reminder that if I ever 
want to collapse a long code snippet, I can.</p> 
<p>Here are some examples.</p> 
<p>Note that</p> 
<ul> 
<li>WordPress knows how to do syntax highlighting for Python. It uses Alex 
Gorbatchev&rsquo;s SyntaxHighlighter.</li> 
<li>If you hover your mouse pointer over the code, you get a pop-up toolbar 
that allows you to look at the original source code snippet, copy it to the 
clipboard, print it, etc.</li> </ul> 
<p>(1)</p> 
<p>First, a normal chunk of relatively short lines of Python code.</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> indentCount = 0 textChars = [] suffixChars = [] # convert the line into 
a list of characters # and feed the list to the ReadAhead generator chars = 
ReadAhead(list(line)) c = chars.next() # get first while c and c == 
INDENT_CHAR: # process indent characters indentCount += 1 c = chars.next() 
while c and c != SYMBOL: # process text characters textChars.append(c) c = 
chars.next() if c and c == SYMBOL: c = chars.next() # read past the SYMBOL 
while c: # process suffix characters suffixChars.append(c) c = chars.next()
</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>(2)</p> 
<p>Here is a different code snippet. This one has a line containing a very 
long comment. Note that the long line is NOT wrapped, and a horizontal 
scrollbar is available so that you can scroll as far to the right as you need 
to. That is because we have specified wraplines=&rdquo;false&rdquo;.</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> somePythonVariable = 1 # This is a long, single-line, comment. I put it 
here to illustrate the effect of the wraplines argument. In this code snippet, 
wraplines=&quot;false&quot;, so lines are NOT wrapped, but extend indefinitely, 
and a horizontal scrollbar is available so that you can scroll as far to the 
right as you need to.</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>(3)</p> 
<p>This is what a similar code snippet would look like if we had specified 
wraplines=true. Note that line 2 wraps around and there is no horizontal 
scrollbar.</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> somePythonVariable = 1 # This is a long, single-line, comment. I put it 
here to illustrate the effect of the wraplines argument. In this code snippet, 
wraplines=&quot;true&quot;, so lines are ARE wrapped. They do NOT extend 
indefinitely, and a horizontal scrollbar is NOT available so that you can 
scroll as far to the right as you need to.</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>(4)</p> 
<p>Finally, the same code snippet with <strong>collapse=true</strong>, so the 
code snippet initially displays as collapsed. Clicking on the collapsed code 
snippet will cause it to expand.</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> somePythonVariable = 1 # This is a long, single-line, comment. I put it 
here to illustrate the effect of the wraplines argument. In this code snippet, 
wraplines=&quot;true&quot;, so lines are ARE wrapped. They do NOT extend 
indefinitely, and a horizontal scrollbar is NOT available so that you can 
scroll as far to the right as you need to.</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>As far as I can tell, once a reader has expanded a snippet that was 
initially collapsed, there is no way for him to re-collapse it. That would be a 
nice enhancement for WordPress &mdash; to allow a reader to collapse and expand 
a code snippet.</p> 
<p>Here is a final thought about wraplines. If you specify <strong>
wraplines=&rdquo;false&rdquo;</strong>, and a reader <em>prints</em> a paper 
copy of your post, the printed output will not show the scrollbar, and it will 
show<em>only </em>the portion of long lines that were visible on the screen. In 
short, the printed output might cut off the right-hand part of long lines.</p> 
<p>In most cases, I think, this should not be a problem. The pop-up tools 
allow a reader to view or print the entire source code snippet if he wants to. 
Still, I can imagine cases in which I might choose to specify<strong>
wraplines=&rdquo;true&rdquo;</strong>, even for a whitespace-sensitive language 
such as Python. And I can understand that someone else, simply as a matter of 
personal taste, might prefer to specify<strong>wraplines=&rdquo;true&rdquo;
</strong> all of the time.</p> 
<p>Now that I think of it, another nice enhancement for WordPress would be to 
allow a reader to toggle wraplines on and off.</p>

<h3> Python3&nbsp;pickling </h3>  Filed under: Moving to Python 3 &mdash; 
Steve Ferg @ 1:40 pm<br>

<p>Recently I was converting some old Python2 code to Python3 and I ran across 
a problem pickling and unpickling.</p> 
<p>I guess I would say it wasn&rsquo;t a <em>major</em> problem because I 
found the solution fairly quickly with a bit of googling around.</p> 
<p>Still,&nbsp;I think the problem and its solution are worth a quick 
note.&nbsp; Others will stumble across this problem in the future, especially 
because there are code examples floating around&nbsp;(in printed books and 
online posts) that will lead new Python programmers to make this very same 
mistake.</p> 
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about pickling.</p> 
<p>Suppose you want to &ldquo;pickle&rdquo; an object &mdash; dump it to a 
pickle file for persistent storage.</p> 
<p>When you pickle an object, you do two things.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You open the file that you want to use as the pickle file. The <em>
open(&hellip;)</em> returns a file handle object.</li> 
<li>You pass the object that you want to pickle, and the file handle object, 
to pickle.</li> </ul> 
<p>Your code might look something like this. <em>Note that this code is 
<strong>wrong</strong>. See below.</em></p> 
<pre>fileHandle = open(pickleFileName, &quot;w&quot;) 
pickle.dump(objectToBePickled, fileHandle)</pre> 
<p>When I wrote code like this, I got back this&nbsp;error message: </p> 
<pre>Pickler(file, protocol, fix_imports=fix_imports).dump(obj) TypeError: 
must be str, not bytes</pre> 
<p>Talk about a crappy error message!!!</p> 
<p>After banging my head against the wall for a while, I googled around and 
quickly found avery helpful answer on StackOverflow.</p> 
<p>The bottom line is that a Python pickle file is (and always has been) a 
byte stream. Which means that you should always open a pickle file&nbsp;in 
binary mode: &ldquo;wb&rdquo; to write it, and &ldquo;rb&rdquo; to read it. The 
Python docs contain correctexample code.</p> 
<p>My old code&nbsp;worked just fine running under Python2 (on Windows).&nbsp; 
But with Python3&prime;s new strict separation of strings and bytes, it 
broke.&nbsp;Changing &ldquo;w&rdquo; to &ldquo;wb&rdquo;, and &ldquo;r&rdquo; 
to &ldquo;rb&rdquo;, fixed it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One person who posted a question about this problem on the Python forum was 
aware of the issue, but confused because he was trying to pickle a string.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>import pickle a = &quot;blah&quot; file = open('state', 'w') 
pickle.dump(a,file)</pre> 
<p>I know of one easy way to solve this is to change the operation argument 
from &lsquo;w&rsquo; to &lsquo;wb&rsquo; but I AM using a string not bytes! And 
none of the examples use &lsquo;wb&rsquo; (I figured that out separately) so I 
want to have an understanding of what is going on here.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Basically, regardless of&nbsp;the <em>kind</em> of object that you are 
pickling (even a string object), the object&nbsp;will be converted to a bytes 
representation and pickled as a byte stream. Which means that you always need 
to use &ldquo;rb&rdquo; and &ldquo;wb&rdquo;, regardless of the kind of object 
that you are pickling.</p> Leave a Comment <br>

<h3> Yet Another Lambda&nbsp;Tutorial </h3>  Filed under: Python features 
&mdash; Steve Ferg @ 3:12 pm<br>

<p><i>modified to use the WordPress [sourcecode] tag &mdash; 2012-01-14</i></p>
<p>There are a lot of tutorials[1] for Python&rsquo;s <em>lambda</em> out 
there. One that I stumbled across recently and really found helpful was Mike 
Driscoll&rsquo;sdiscussion of lambda on the Mouse vs Python blog.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> When I first started learning Python, one of the most confusing concepts 
to get my head around was the lambda statement. I&rsquo;m sure other new 
programmers get confused by it as well&hellip;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Mike&rsquo;s discussion is excellent: clear, straight-forward, with useful 
illustrative examples. It helped me &mdash; finally &mdash; to grok lambda, and 
led me to write<strong>yet another</strong> lambda tutorial. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>Lambda: a tool for building functions</h1> 
<p>Basically, Python&rsquo;s <em>lambda</em> is a tool for building functions 
(or more precisely, function objects). That means that Python hastwo tools for 
building functions:<em>def</em> and <em>lambda</em>.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. You can build a function in the normal way, using 
<em>def</em>, like this:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>def square_root(x): return math.sqrt(x)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>or you can use <em>lambda</em>:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>square_root = lambda x: math.sqrt(x)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here are a few other interesting examples of lambda:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>sum = lambda x, y: x + y # def sum(x,y): return x + y out = lambda *x: 
sys.stdout.write(&quot; &quot;.join(map(str,x))) lambda event, 
name=button8.getLabel(): self.onButton(event, name)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>What is lambda good for?</h1> 
<p>A question that I&rsquo;ve had for a long time is: <em>What is lambda good 
for? Why do we need lambda?</em></p> 
<p>The answer is:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>We don&rsquo;t need lambda, we could get along all right without it. 
But&hellip;</li> 
<li>there are certain situations where it is convenient &mdash; it makes 
writing code a bit easier, and the written code a bit cleaner.</li> </ul> 
<p>What kind of situations?</p> 
<p>Well, situations in which we need a simple one-off function: a function 
that is going to be used only once.</p> 
<p>Normally, functions are created for one of two purposes: (a) to reduce code 
duplication, or (b) to modularize code.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If your application contains duplicate chunks of code in various places, 
then you can put one copy of that code into a function, give the function a 
name, and then &mdash; using that function name &mdash; call it from various 
places in your code.</li> 
<li>If you have a chunk of code that performs one well-defined operation 
&mdash; but is really long and gnarly and interrupts the otherwise readable 
flow of your program &mdash; then you can pull that long gnarly code out and 
put it into a function all by itself.</li> </ul> 
<p>But suppose you need to create a function that is going to be used only 
once &mdash; called from<em>only one</em> place in your application. Well, 
first of all, you don&rsquo;t need to give the function a name. It can be 
&ldquo;anonymous&rdquo;. And you can just define it right in the place where 
you want to use it. That&rsquo;s where lambda is useful.</p> 
<p>But, but, but&hellip; you say.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First of all &mdash; Why would you want a function that is called only 
once? That eliminates reason (a) for making a function.</li> 
<li>And the body of a lambda can contain only a single expression. That means 
that lambdas must be short. So that eliminates reason (b) for making a function.
</li> </ul> 
<p>What possible reason could I have for wanting to create a short, anonymous 
function?</p> 
<p>Well, consider this snippet of code that uses lambda to define the behavior 
of buttons in a Tkinter GUI interface. (This example is from Mike&rsquo;s 
tutorial.)</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>frame = tk.Frame(parent) frame.pack() btn22 = tk.Button(frame, 
text=&quot;22&quot;, command=lambda: self.printNum(22)) 
btn22.pack(side=tk.LEFT) btn44 = tk.Button(frame, text=&quot;44&quot;, 
command=lambda: self.printNum(44)) btn44.pack(side=tk.LEFT)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>The thing to remember here is that a <em>tk.Button</em> expects a <strong>
function object</strong> as an argument to the <em>command</em> parameter. That 
function object will be the function that the button calls when it (the button) 
is clicked. Basically, that function specifies what the GUI will do when the 
button is clicked.</p> 
<p>So we must pass a function object in to a button via the <em>command </em>
parameter. And note that &mdash; since different buttons do different things 
&mdash; we need a different function object for each button object. Each 
function will be used only once, by the particular button to which it is being 
supplied.</p> 
<p>So, although we <em>could </em>code (say)</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>def __init__(self, parent): 
&quot;&quot;&quot;Constructor&quot;&quot;&quot; frame = tk.Frame(parent) 
frame.pack() btn22 = tk.Button(frame, text=&quot;22&quot;, 
command=self.buttonCmd22) btn22.pack(side=tk.LEFT) btn44 = tk.Button(frame, 
text=&quot;44&quot;, command=self.buttonCmd44) btn44.pack(side=tk.LEFT) def 
buttonCmd22(self): self.printNum(22) def buttonCmd44(self): self.printNum(44)
</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>it is much easier (and clearer) to code</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> def __init__(self, parent): 
&quot;&quot;&quot;Constructor&quot;&quot;&quot; frame = tk.Frame(parent) 
frame.pack() btn22 = tk.Button(frame, text=&quot;22&quot;, command=lambda: 
self.printNum(22)) btn22.pack(side=tk.LEFT) btn44 = tk.Button(frame, 
text=&quot;44&quot;, command=lambda: self.printNum(44)) btn44.pack(side=tk.LEFT)
</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>When a GUI program has this kind of code, the button object is said to 
&ldquo;call back&rdquo; to the function object that was supplied to it as its
<em>command</em>.</p> 
<p>So we can say that one of the most frequent uses of lambda is in coding 
&ldquo;callbacks&rdquo; to GUI frameworks such as Tkinter and wxPython.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This all seems pretty straight-forward. So&hellip;</p> 
<h1>Why is lambda so confusing?</h1> 
<p>There are four reasons that I can think of.</p> 
<p><strong>First</strong> <em>Lambda is confusing because:</em> the 
requirement that a lambda can take only a single<em>expression</em> raises the 
question:<em>What is an expression?</em></p> 
<p>A lot of people would like to know the answer to that one. If you Google 
around a bit, you will see a lot of posts from people asking &ldquo;In Python, 
what&rsquo;s the difference between an expression and a statement?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>One good answer is that an expression returns (or evaluates to) a value, 
whereas a statement does not. Unfortunately, the situation is muddled by the 
fact that in Python an expression can also be a statement. And we can always 
throw a red herring into the mix &mdash; assigment statements like<code>a = b = 
0</code> suggest that Python supports <em>chained assignments</em>, and that 
assignment statements return values. (They do not. Python isn&rsquo;t C.)[2]</p>
<p>In many cases when people ask this question, what they really want to know 
is:<em>What kind of things can I, and can I not, put into a lambda?</em></p> 
<p>And for <em>that</em> question, I think a few simple rules of thumb will be 
sufficient.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If it doesn&rsquo;t return a value, it isn&rsquo;t an expression and 
can&rsquo;t be put into a lambda.</li> 
<li>If you can imagine it in an assignment statement, on the right-hand side 
of the equals sign, it is an expression and can be put into a lambda.</li> </ul>
<p>Using these rules means that:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Assignment statements cannot be used in lambda. In Python, assignment 
statements don&rsquo;t returnanything, not even None (null).</li> 
<li>Simple things such as mathematical operations, string operations, list 
comprehensions, etc. are OK in a lambda.</li> 
<li>Function calls are expressions. It is OK to put a function call in a 
lambda, and to pass arguments to that function. Doing this wraps the function 
call (arguments and all) inside a new, anonymous function.</li> 
<li>In Python 3, <em>print </em>became a function, so in Python 3+, <em>
print(&hellip;)</em> can be used in a lambda.</li> 
<li>Even functions that return None, like the <em>print</em> function in 
Python 3, can be used in a lambda.</li> 
<li>Conditional expressions, which were introduced in Python 2.5, are 
expressions (and not merely a different syntax for an<em>if/else</em> 
statement). They return a value, and can be used in a lambda.
<p></p>
<pre>lambda: a if some_condition() else b lambda x: &lsquo;big&rsquo; if x 
&gt; 100 else &lsquo;small&rsquo;</pre>
<p></p> </li> </ol> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Second</strong> <em>Lambda is confusing because:</em> the 
specification that a lambda can take only a<em>single</em> expression raises 
the question:<em>Why? Why only one expression? Why not multiple expressions? 
Why not statements?</em></p> 
<p>For some developers, this question means simply <em>Why is the Python 
lambda syntax so weird?</em> For others, especially those with a Lisp 
background, the question means<em>Why is Python&rsquo;s lambda so crippled? Why 
isn&rsquo;t it as powerful as Lisp&rsquo;s lambda?</em></p> 
<p>The answer is complicated, and it involves the &ldquo;pythonicity&rdquo; of 
Python&rsquo;s syntax. Lambda was a relatively late addition to Python. By the 
time that it was added, Python syntax had become well established. Under the 
circumstances, the syntax for lambda had to be shoe-horned into the established 
Python syntax in a &ldquo;pythonic&rdquo; way. And that placed certain 
limitations on the kinds of things that could be done in lambdas.</p> 
<p>Frankly, I still think the syntax for lambda looks a little weird. Be that 
as it may, Guido has explained why lambda&rsquo;s syntax is not going to 
change. Python will not become Lisp.[3]</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Third</strong> <em>Lambda is confusing because:</em> lambda is 
usually described as a tool for creating functions, but a lambda specification 
does not contain a<em>return</em> statement. </p> 
<p>The <em>return</em> statement is, in a sense, implicit in a lambda. Since a 
lambda specification must contain only a single expression, and that expression 
must return a value, an anonymous function created by lambda implicitly returns 
the value returned by the expression. This makes perfect sense.</p> 
<p>Still &mdash; the lack of an explicit <em>return</em> statement is, I 
think, part of what makes it hard to grok lambda, or at least, hard to grok it 
quickly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Fourth</strong> <em>Lambda is confusing because:</em> tutorials on 
lambda typically introduce lambda as a tool for creating anonymous<em>functions
</em>, when in fact the most common use of lambda is for creating anonymous <em>
procedures</em>.</p> 
<p>Back in the High Old Times, we recognized two different kinds of 
subroutines: procedures and functions. Procedures were for<em>doing</em> stuff, 
and did not return anything. Functions were for calculating and<em>returning 
values</em>. The difference between functions and procedures was even built 
into some programming languages. In Pascal, for instance,<em>procedure</em> and 
<em>function</em> were different keywords.</p> 
<p>In most modern languages, the difference between procedures and functions 
is no longer enshrined in the language syntax. A Python function, for instance, 
can act like a procedure, a function, or both. The (not altogether desirable) 
result is that a Python function is always referred to as a 
&ldquo;function&rdquo;, even when it is essentially acting as a procedure.</p> 
<p>Although the distinction between a procedure and a function has essentially 
vanished as a language construct, we still often use it when thinking about how 
a program works. For example, when I&rsquo;m reading the source code of a 
program and see some function F, I try to figure out what F does. And I often 
can categorize it as a procedure or a function &mdash; &ldquo;the purpose of F 
is to do so-and-so&rdquo; I will say to myself, or &ldquo;the purpose of F is 
to calculate and return such-and-such&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>So now I think we can see why many explanations of lambda are confusing. 
</p> 
<p>First of all, the Python language itself masks the distinction between a 
function and a procedure.</p> 
<p>Second, most tutorials introduce lambda as a tool for creating anonymous 
<em>functions</em>, things whose primary purpose is to calculate and return a 
result. The very first example that you see in most tutorials (this one 
included) shows how to write a lambda to return, say, the square root of x.</p> 
<p>But this is not the way that lambda is most commonly used, and is not what 
most programmers are looking for when they Google &ldquo;python lambda 
tutorial&rdquo;. The most common use for lambda is to create anonymous<em>
procedures</em> for use in GUI callbacks. In those use cases, we don&rsquo;t 
care about what the lambda<em>returns</em>, we care about what it <em>does</em>.
</p> 
<p>This explains why most explanations of lambda are confusing for the typical 
Python programmer. He&rsquo;s trying to learn how to write code for some GUI 
framework: Tkinter, say, or wxPython. He runs across examples that use lambda, 
and wants to understand what he&rsquo;s seeing. He Googles for &ldquo;python 
lambda tutorial&rdquo;. And he finds tutorials that start with examples that 
are entirely inappropriate for his purposes.</p> 
<p>So, if you are such a programmer &mdash; this tutorial is for you. I hope 
it helps. I&rsquo;m sorry that we got to this point at the end of the tutorial, 
rather than at the beginning. Let&rsquo;s hope that someday, someone will write 
a lambda tutorial that, instead of beginning this way</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Lambda is a tool for building anonymous functions.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>begins something like this</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Lambda is a tool for building callback handlers.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So there you have it. Yet another lambda tutorial.</p>

returns the assigned value. This allows<em>chained assignments</em> such as

returns the value of<code>a</code>, which is then assigned to <code>x</code>. 
In Python, assignment statements do<strong>not</strong> return a value. Chained 
assignment (or more precisely, code that<em>looks like</em> chained assignment 
statements) is recognized and supported as a special case of the assignment 
statement.</p>

the power of Python&rsquo;s lambda, moving it closer to the power of lambda in 
Lisp. There have been anumber of proposals for a syntax for &ldquo;multi-line 
lambda&rdquo;, and so on. Guidohas rejected these proposals and blogged about 
some of his thinking about &ldquo;pythonicity&rdquo; and language features as a 
user interface. This led to an interesting discussion on <em>Lambda the 
Ultimate, the programming languages weblog</em> about lambda, and about the 
idea that programming languages have personalities.</p> Comments (14) <br>

<h3> Read-Ahead and Python&nbsp;Generators </h3>  Filed under: Python &amp; JSD
 &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 12:15 pm<br>

<p>One of the early classics of program design is Michael Jackson&rsquo;s <em>
Principles of Program Design</em> (1975), which introduced (what later came to 
be known as) JSP: Jackson Structured Programming.</p> 
<p>Back in the 1970&prime;s, most business application programs did their work 
by reading and writing sequential files of records stored on tape. And it was 
common to see programs whose top-level control structure looked like (what I 
will call) the &ldquo;standard loop&rdquo;:</p> 
<pre>open input file F while not EndOfFile on F: read a record process the 
record close F</pre> 
<p>Jackson showed that this way of processing a sequence almost always created 
unnecessary problems in the program logic, and that a better way was to use 
what he called a &ldquo;read-ahead&rdquo; technique.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the read-ahead technique, a record is read from the input file 
immediately after the file is opened, and then a second &ldquo;read&rdquo; 
statement is executed after each record is processed.</p> 
<p>This technique produces a program structure like this:</p> 
<pre>open input file F read a record from F # get first while not EndOfFile on 
F: process the record read the next record from F # get next close F</pre> 
<p>I won&rsquo;t try to explain when or why the read-ahead technique is 
preferable to the standard loop. That&rsquo;s out of scope for this blog entry, 
and a good book on JSP can explain that better than I can. So for now, 
let&rsquo;s just say that there are some situations in which the standard loop 
is the right tool for the job, and there are other situations in which 
read-ahead is the right tool for the job.</p> 
<p>One of the joys of Python is that Python makes it so easy to do 
&ldquo;standard loop&rdquo; processing on a sequence such as a list or a string.
</p> 
<pre>for item in sequence: processItem(item)</pre> 
<p>There are times, however, when you have a sequence that you need to process 
with the read-ahead technique.</p> 
<p>With Python generators, it is easy to do. Generators make it easy to 
convert a sequence into a kind of object that provides both a<em>get next</em> 
method and an<em>end-of-file mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That kind of object&nbsp;can 
easily be processed using the read-ahead technique.</p> 
<p>Suppose that we have a list of items (called <em>listOfItems</em>) and we 
wish to process it&nbsp;using the read-ahead technique.</p> 
<p>First, we create the &ldquo;read-ahead&rdquo; generator:</p> 
<pre>def ReadAhead(sequence): for item in sequence: yield item yield None # 
return the &quot;end of file mark&quot; after the last item</pre> 
<p>Then we can write our code this way:</p> 
<pre>items = ReadAhead(listOfItems) item = items.next() # get first while 
item: processItem(item) item = items.next() # get next</pre> 
<p>Here is a simple example.</p> 
<p>We have a string (called &ldquo;line&rdquo;) consisting of characters. Each 
line consists of zero or more indent characters, some text characters, and 
(optionally) a special SYMBOL character followed by some suffix characters. For 
those familiar with JSP, the input structure diagram looks like this.</p> 
<pre>line - indent * one indent char - text * one text char - possible suffix 
o no suffix o suffix - suffix SYMBOL - suffix - one suffix char</pre> 
<p>We want to parse the line into 3 groups: indent characters, text 
characters, and suffix characters.</p> 
<pre>indentCount = 0 textChars = [] suffixChars = [] # convert the line into a 
list of characters # and feed the list to the ReadAhead generator chars = 
ReadAhead(list(line)) c = chars.next() # get first while c and c == 
INDENT_CHAR: # process indent characters indentCount += 1 c = chars.next() 
while c and c != SYMBOL: # process text characters textChars.append(c) c = 
chars.next() if c and c == SYMBOL: c = chars.next() # read past the SYMBOL 
while c: # process suffix characters suffixChars.append(c) c = chars.next()

<h3> In Java, what is the difference between an abstract class and 
an&nbsp;interface? </h3>  Filed under: Java and Python &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 
1:32 pm<br>

<p>This post is about Java, and has nothing to do with Python.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve posted it here so&nbsp;that it can be available to other folks who 
might find it useful. (And because I don&rsquo;t have a Java blog!)</p> 
<p><strong>In Java, what is the difference between an abstract class and an 
interface?</strong></p> 
<p>This is a question that comes up periodically. When I Googled for answers 
to it, I didn&rsquo;t very much like any of the answers that I found, so I 
wrote my own. For those who might be interested, here it is.</p> 
<p>Q: What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?</p> 
<p>A: Good question.</p> 
<p>To help explain, first let me introduce some terminology that I hope will 
help clarify the situation.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I will say that a <strong>fully</strong> abstract class is an abstract 
class in which<strong>all</strong> methods are abstract.</li> 
<li>In contrast, a <strong>partially</strong> abstract class is an abstract 
class in which some of the methods are abstract, and some are concrete (i.e. 
have implementations).</li> </ul> 
<p>Q: OK. So what is the difference between a fully abstract class and an 
interface?</p> 
<p>A: Basically, none. They are the same.</p> 
<p>Q: Then why does Java have the concept of an interface, as well as the 
concept of an abstract class?</p> 
<p>A: Because Java doesn&rsquo;t support multiple inheritance. Or rather I 
should say, it supports a limited form of multiple inheritance.</p> 
<p>Q: Huh??!!!</p> 
<p>A: Java has a rule that a class can extend only one abstract class, but can 
implement multiple interfaces (fully abstract classes).</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Java has such a rule.</p> 
<p>Remember that a class can be an abstract class without being a <strong>fully
</strong> abstract class. It can be a <strong>partially</strong> abstract class.
</p> 
<p>Now imagine that that we have two partially abstract classes A and B. Both 
have some abstract methods, and both contain a non-abstract method called foo().
</p> 
<p>And imagine that Java allows a class to extend more than one abstract 
class, so we can write a class C that extends both A and B. And imagine that C 
doesn&rsquo;t implement foo().</p> 
<p>So now there is a problem. Suppose we create an instance of C and invoke 
its foo() method. Which foo() should Java invoke? A.foo() or B.foo()?</p> 
<p>Some languages allow multiple inheritance, and have a way to answer that 
question. Python for example has a &ldquo;method resolution order&rdquo; 
algorithm that determines the order in which superclasses are searched, looking 
for an implementation of foo().</p> 
<p>But the designers of Java made a different choice. They choose to make it a 
rule that a class can inherit from as many<strong>fully</strong> abstract 
classes it wants, but can inherit from only one<strong>partially</strong> 
abstract class. That way, the question of which foo() to use will never come up.
</p> 
<p>This is a form of limited multiple inheritance. Basically, the rule says 
that you can inherit from (extend) as many classes as you want, but if you do, 
only<strong>one</strong> of those classes can contain concrete (implemented) 
methods.</p> 
<p>So now we do a little terminology substitution:</p> 
<p><em>abstract class</em> = a class that contains at least one abstract 
method, and can also contain concrete (implemented) methods</p> 
<p><em>interface</em> =&nbsp; a class that is fully abstract&nbsp;&mdash; it 
has abstract methods, but<strong>no </strong>concrete methods</p> 
<p>With those substitutions, you get the familiar Java rule:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>A class can extend at most one abstract class, but may implement many 
interfaces.</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>That is, Java supports a limited form of multiple inheritance.</p> Comments

<h3> Newline conversion in Python&nbsp;3 </h3>  Filed under: Moving to Python 3
 &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 2:21 pm<br>

<p>I use Python on both Windows and Unix.&nbsp; Occasionally when running on 
Windows&nbsp; I need to read in a file containing Windows newlines and write it 
out with Unix/Linux newlines.&nbsp; And sometimes when running on Unix, I need 
to run the newline conversion in the other direction.</p> 
<p>Prior to Python 3, the accepted way to do this was to read data from the 
file in binary mode, convert the newline characters in the data, and then write 
the data out again in binary mode. The Tools/Scripts directory contained two 
scripts (crlf.py and lfcr.py) with illustrative examples. Here, for instance is 
the key code from crlf.py (Windows to Unix conversion)</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre> data = open(filename, &quot;rb&quot;).read() newdata = 
data.replace(&quot;\r\n&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;) if newdata != data: f = 
open(filename, &quot;wb&quot;) f.write(newdata) f.close()</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>But if you try to do that with Python 3+, it won&rsquo;t work.</p> 
<p>The key to what <em>will</em> work is the new &ldquo;newline&rdquo; 
argument for the built-in file open() function. It is documentedhere.</p> 
<p>The key point from that documentation is this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>newline</em> controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to 
text mode). It can beNone, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'. It works as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>On input, if <em>newline</em> is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. 
Lines in the input can end in'\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are translated 
into'\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is '', universal newline 
mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If 
it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the 
given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.</p>

<li> 
<p>On output, if <em>newline</em> is None, any '\n' characters written are 
translated to the system default line separator,os.linesep. If <em>newline</em> 
is'', no translation takes place. If <em>newline</em> is any of the other legal 
values, any'\n' characters written are translated to the given string.</p> </li>

<p>So now when I want to convert a file from Windows-style newlines to 
Linux-style newlines, I do this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre> filename = &quot;NameOfFileToBeConverted&quot; fileContents = 
open(filename,&quot;r&quot;).read() f = open(filename,&quot;w&quot;, 
newline=&quot;\n&quot;) f.write(fileContents) f.close()</pre> </blockquote>

<h3> Why import star is a bad&nbsp;idea </h3>  Filed under: Python features 
&mdash; Steve Ferg @ 1:55 pm<br>

<p>&#65279;When I was learning Python, I of course read the usual warnings. 
They told me: You<em>can </em>do</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><code>from something_or_other import *</code></p> </blockquote> 
<p>but <em>don&rsquo;t</em> do it. Importing star (asterisk, everything) is a 
Python Worst Practice.</p> 
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;import star&rdquo;!</em></p> 
<p>But I was young and foolish, and my scripts were short. &ldquo;How bad can 
it be?&rdquo; I thought. So I did it anyway, and everything seemed to work out 
OK.</p> 
<p>Then, like they always do, the quick-and-dirty scripts grew into programs, 
and then grew into a full-blown system. Before long I had a monster on my 
hands, and I needed a tool that would look through all of the scripts and 
programs in the system and do (at least) some basic error checking.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d heard good things about pyflakes, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it 
a try.</p> 
<p>It worked very nicely. It found the basic kinds of errors that I wanted it 
to find. And it was fast, so I could run it through a directory containing a 
lot of .py files and it would come out alive and grinning on the other side.</p>
<p>During the process, I learned that pyflakes is designed to be a bit on the 
quick and dirty side itself, with the quick making up for the dirty. As part of 
this process, it basically ignores star imports.&nbsp; Oh, it warns you about 
the star imports.&nbsp; What I means is&nbsp;&mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t try to 
figure out<em>what </em>is imported by the star import.</p> 
<p>And that has interesting consequences.</p> 
<p>Normally, if your file contains an undefined name &mdash; say 
TARGET_LANGAGE &mdash; pyflakes will report it as an error.</p> 
<p>But if your file includes <em>any </em>star imports, and your script 
contains an undefined name like TARGET_LANGAGE, pyflakes won&rsquo;t report the 
undefined name as an error.</p> 
<p>My hypothesis is that pyflakes doesn&rsquo;t report TARGET_LANGAGE as 
undefined because it can&rsquo;t tell whether TARGET_LANGAGE is truly 
undefined, or was pulled in by some star import.</p> 
<p>This is perfectly understandable. There is no way that pyflakes is going to 
go out, try to find the something_or_other module, and analyze it to see if it 
contains TARGET_LANGAGE. And if it doesn&rsquo;t, but contains star imports, go 
out and look for all of the modules that something_or_other star imports, and 
then analyze them. And so on, and so on, and so on. No way!</p> 
<p>So, since pyflakes can&rsquo;t tell whether TARGET_LANGAGE is (a) an 
undefined name or (b) pulled in via some star import, it&nbsp;<em>does not 
report</em>&nbsp;&#65279;TARGET_LANGAGE as an undefined name. 
Basically,&nbsp;pyflakes ignores it.</p> 
<p>And that seems to me to be&nbsp;a perfectly reasonable way to do business, 
not just for pyflakes but for anything short of the Super Deluxe Hyperdrive 
model static code analyzer.</p> 
<p>The takeaway lesson for me was that using star imports will cripple a 
static code analyzer. Or at least, cripple the feature that I most want a code 
analyser for&hellip; to find and report undefined names.</p> 
<p>So now I don&rsquo;t use star imports anymore.</p> 
<p>There are a variety of alternatives.&nbsp; The one that I prefer is the 
&ldquo;import x as y&rdquo; feature. So I can write an import statement this 
way:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><code>import&nbsp; &nbsp;some_module_with_a_big_long_hairy_name&nbsp; 
&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bx</code></p> </blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;and rather than coding</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><code>x = some_module_with_a_big_long_hairy_name.vector</code></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I can code</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><code>&#65279;&#65279;x = bx.vector</code></p> </blockquote> 
<p>Works for me.</p> Comments (6) <br>

<h3> Learning Subversion: the mystery of&nbsp;.svn </h3>  Filed under: 
Subversion &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 2:11 pm <br>

<p><em>If you are googling for &ldquo;Subversion command line tutorial 
introduction for beginners&rdquo;, read this first! This is for all Subversion 
newbies.</em></p> 
<p>After using PVCS for many years, our office recently started moving to 
Subversion. Which means that recently I started trying to learn Subversion.</p> 
<p>I was pressed for time. I was in a hurry. I was looking for something that 
would get me up and running quickly.</p> 
<p>First, I got a copy of the free online Subversion documentation Version 
Control with Subversion.</p> 
<p>Second, I got a copy of Mike Mason&rsquo;s excellent <em>Pragmatic Version 
Control Using Subversion</em> (2nd ed.).</p> 
<p>Third, I googled the Web looking for the kinds of things that you&rsquo;d 
expect: Subversion tutorial introduction beginning beginners commands. And I 
found some good stuff.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>An introduction to Subversion</li> 
<li>Short introduction to Subversion</li> 
<li>Subversion Basics</li> 
<li>Subversion Commands and Scripts</li> 
<li>svn command line tutorial for beginners</li> 
<li>svn command line tutorial for beginners 2</li> 
<li>How to use Subversion</li> 
<li>Getting Started with Subversion on Windows</li> 
<li>Subversion Cheat Sheet</li> </ul> 
<p>But even after reading many of the online Subversion tutorials, I still 
could not grok Subversion. Different commands seemed to be doing the same 
thing, and the tutorials used a lot of terms that were never defined or 
explained: &ldquo;versioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;unversioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;under 
version control&rdquo;, and so on.</p> 
<p>Gradually, I realized the problem. Many of the online tutorials and 
introductions try to explain how to<em>use</em> Subversion without explaining 
how Subversion<em>works</em>. They tell you what commands to issue, and when, 
but they don&rsquo;t tell you<em>why</em> you are issuing the command at this 
particular time, or what the command is doing under the covers.</p> 
<p>So I had to dig deeper.</p> 
<p>What I found was that there was one particular piece of information missing 
from most of the tutorials and introductions that I found. If you don&rsquo;t 
have that piece, nothing about Subversion makes much sense. With it, all of the 
other pieces of the puzzle fall into place.</p> 
<p>So the purpose of this post is to tell you &mdash; the Subversion newbie 
&mdash; about that piece.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>How Subversion Works</h2> 
<p>The basic unit of work for Subversion is a <strong>project</strong>.</p> 
<p>A project is basically a directory.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Technically, a project is a subtree: a directory, including all of its 
files and subdirectories, and all of those subdirectories&rsquo; files and 
subdirectories, etc. But in order to keep things simple, I will talk as if a 
project is just a directory.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>When you are working on a Subversion project, there are actually <strong>two
</strong>directories that you are working with.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>There is the <strong>repository</strong>, which is a directory (controlled 
by Subversion and running on a server somewhere) that contains the master copy 
of the project directory.</li> 
<li>There is your own personal <strong>workingCopy</strong>, which is a 
directory (controlled by you) that exists on the file system of your own 
machine (that is, on the hard drive of your own PC).</li> </ul> 
<p>But (and this is the piece that was missing) <strong>a workingCopy 
directory is not an ordinary directory.</strong></p> 
<p>The use of the expression &ldquo;working copy&rdquo; is one of the most 
confusing things about Subversion tutorials and even the Subversion 
documentation itself. When you encounter the expression &ldquo;working 
copy&rdquo; you assume that you are dealing with an ordinary filesystem 
directory that is being used to hold a copy of the files in your project.<em>
Not so!</em></p> 
<p>In the context of Subversion, &ldquo;working copy&rdquo; is a very specific 
term of art &mdash; a Subversion-specific technical term. That is why in this 
post I avoid the expression &ldquo;working copy&rdquo; and instead use<strong>
workingCopy</strong>.</p> 
<p>So what is a Subversion workingCopy directory?</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>A workingCopy directory is a directory that has a hidden 
subdirectory called &ldquo;.svn&rdquo;.</strong></p> 
<p>The hidden .svn directory is what Subversion calls an &ldquo;administrative 
directory&rdquo;.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Note the leading period in &ldquo;.svn&rdquo;. On Unix systems, a directory 
whose name begins with a dot is a&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; (or 
&ldquo;dotfile&rdquo;) directory.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>On your PC, the project&rsquo;s top-level workingCopy directory has a 
hidden .svn subdirectory. And each of the subdirectories of the workingCopy 
directory (if it has any), and each of their subdirectories (if they have any), 
and so on, has its own hidden .svn subdirectory.</p> 
<p>Having a hidden .svn subdirectory is what makes an ordinary file system 
directory into a Subversion workingCopy directory, a directory that Subversion 
can recognize and manage.</p> 
<p>So, for a project named &ldquo;ProjectX&rdquo; the workingCopy directory 
will be named &ldquo;ProjectX&rdquo;. It might look like this:</p> 
<pre> ProjectX [DIRECTORY] projectx.py projectx_constants.py .svn [DIRECTORY]
</pre> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>What is in a .svn subdirectory? What does a Subversion administrative 
directory contain?</h2> 
<p>The Subversion documentation says this about workingCopy directories:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on your local 
system, containing a collection of files. You can edit these files however you 
wish, and if they&rsquo;re source code files, you can compile your program from 
them in the usual way. &hellip;</p> 
<p>A working copy also contains some extra files, created and maintained by 
Subversion, to help it carry out these commands. In particular, each directory 
in your working copy contains a subdirectory named .svn, also known as the 
working copy&rsquo;s administrative directory. The files in each administrative 
directory help Subversion recognize which files contain unpublished changes, 
and which files are out of date with respect to others&rsquo; work.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s another clue: a passage from <em>Pragmatic Version Control 
Using Subversion</em>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Subversion has a highly efficient network protocol and stores pristine 
copies of your working files locally, allowing a user to see what changes 
they&rsquo;ve made without even contacting the server [where the central 
repository is stored].</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So now we know what a Subversion administrative directory contains.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>The .svn admin directory contains pristine (unchanged) copies of 
files that were downloaded from the repository.</strong> (It contains a few 
other things, too.)</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Earlier, I said &ldquo;When you are working on a Subversion project, there 
are actually TWO directories that you are working with&hellip; the repository 
and the working copy.&rdquo; Now I want to change that. It would be more 
accurate to say that there are really THREE directories that you are working 
with:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the main ProjectX repository on the server</li> 
<li>the ProjectX workingCopy directory on your PC, which contains editable 
(and possibly changed) copies of the files in the project &hellip;and also 
&hellip;</li> 
<li>the hidden Subversion administrative directory, which contains a 
(pristine, unchanged, and uneditable) copies of the files in the main ProjectX 
repository on the server.</li> </ul> 
<p>That means that, on your PC, the ProjectX workingCopy directory looks like 
this.</p> 
<pre> ProjectX [DIRECTORY] projectx.py projectx_constants.py .svn [DIRECTORY] 
projectx.py projectx_constants.py</pre> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Now things start to become clearer&hellip;</h2> 
<p>Subversion introductions and tutorials often say things that are rather 
cryptic to someone who is trying to learn Subversion. Even HELP questions and 
FAQs posted on the Web can be mystifying. Now let&rsquo;s see how some of those 
things make sense in light of our knowledge of the .svn subdirectory.</p> 
<p> <strong>Showing file changes</strong></p> 
<p>The reason that Subversion can allow &ldquo;a user to see what changes 
they&rsquo;ve made without even contacting the server&rdquo; is that the 
Subversion diff works only on the workingCopy directory<em>on your own PC.</em>
</p> 
<p>When Subversion shows file changes (that is, shows diffs) it is actually 
showing diffs between</p> 
<ul> 
<li>your edited files in the workingCopy directory, and</li> 
<li>the pristine copies of the those files that are being held in the .svn 
subdirectory of the workingCopy directory.</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>&ldquo;unversioned&rdquo; files vs. files &ldquo;under version 
control&rdquo;</strong></p> 
<p>Suppose that I make a change to one of my files: to <code>
ProjectX/projectx_constants.py</code>.</p> 
<p>When I make the changes, my editor automatically creates a backup file: 
<code>ProjectX/projectx_constants.py.bak</code>.</p> 
<p>At this point, <code>ProjectX/projectx_constants.py.bak</code> is what is 
called an &ldquo;unversioned&rdquo; file. It exists in the ProjectX directory, 
but not in the ProjectX/.svn directory, so Subversion knows nothing about it. 
That makes sense: we don&rsquo;t want<code>projectx_constants.py.bak</code> to 
be considered a project file anyway.</p> 
<p>But suppose I want to add a new module to the project, called <code>
projectx_utils.py</code>. If I simply create the file in the ProjectX folder, 
it will be an &ldquo;unversioned&rdquo; file in just the same way that<code>
projectx_constants.py.bak</code> is an unversioned file: it will not exist in 
the ProjectX/.svn directory, so Subversion knows nothing about it.</p> 
<p>So that is why Subversion has a &ldquo;svn add&rdquo; command. The command 
<code>svn add projectx_utils.py</code> will add the file to the project by 
copying<code>ProjectX/project_utils.py</code> to <code>
ProjectX/.svn/project_utils.py</code>. At this point &mdash; after it has been 
added to the .svn subdirectory &mdash; the file is said to be &ldquo;under 
version control&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Note that &mdash; at this point &mdash; although <code>project_utils.py
</code> has been &ldquo;added&rdquo; to the copy of the project in the 
workingCopy, the main repository still doesn&rsquo;t know anything about it 
&mdash;<code>project_utils.py</code> hasn&rsquo;t been added to the central 
repository on the server.</p> 
<p>When I &ldquo;commit&rdquo; my changes, I send the files from my 
workingCopy to the main repository. Only after that happens does the new file 
truly become part of the project by becoming one of the files in the central 
repository.</p> 
<p> <strong>Help! I&rsquo;ve lost my .svn directory and I can&rsquo;t get up!
</strong></p> 
<p>Because a Subversion workingCopy directory needs a .svn subdirectory in 
order to work properly, you can have problems with Subversion if you
accidentally delete the .svn subdirectory.</p> 
<p> <strong>What is a &ldquo;clean copy&rdquo;?</strong></p> 
<p>In various tutorials, and in the Subversion docs, you will run across the 
expression &ldquo;clean copy&rdquo;. A &ldquo;clean copy&rdquo; is a copy of 
only the source-code files, without the .svn directory.</p> 
<p>An introduction to Subversion (which is also a nice introduction to the 
TortoiseSVN open-source Windows GUI client for Subversion) explains things 
nicely.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you look closely in your working copy, you may see an .svn folder in 
each folder of your working copy. The folders are hidden folders, so depending 
on the Windows settings you may not see them, but they are there. Those folders 
contain the information that Subversion uses to link your working copy to the 
repository.</p> 
<p>If ever you need to get a copy of what&rsquo;s in the repository, but 
without all the .svn folders (say for example you&rsquo;re ready to publish it 
or hand the files over to your client), you can do an &ldquo;SVN Export&rdquo; 
into a new folder to get a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; copy of what&rsquo;s in your 
repository.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Having the concept of a &ldquo;clean copy&rdquo; makes it easier to 
understand the next question&hellip;</p> 
<p> <strong>Checkout vs. Export</strong></p> 
<p>A Frequently Asked Question about Subversion is <em>What&rsquo;s the 
difference between a &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; and an &ldquo;export&rdquo; from 
the repository?</em></p> 
<p>The CollabNet docs say this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>They are the same except that Export doesn&rsquo;t include the.svn folders 
and Checkout does include them. Also note that an export cannot be updated.</p> 
<p>When you do a Subversion checkout, every folder and subfolder contains an 
.svn folder. These.svn folders contain clean copies of all files checked out 
and .tmp directories that contain temporary files created during checkouts, 
commits, update and other operations.</p> 
<p>An Export will be about half the size of a Checkout due to the absence of 
the.svn folders that duplicate all content.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Note that the reason an exported folder cannot be updated is that the <code>
update</code> command updates the .svn directory of a workingCopy, but an 
export does not create an .svn directory.</p> 
<p>Note also that you can export from either the main repository or from the 
workingCopy .svn directory. SeeSubversion docs for export.</p> 
<p> <strong>The <code>(import, checkout)</code> usage pattern for getting 
started with Subversion</strong></p> 
<p>Most &ldquo;getting started with Subversion&rdquo; tutorials start the same 
way. Assuming that you have some project files that you want to put into 
Subversion, you are told to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>do an import</li> 
<li>do a checkout</li> </ul> 
<p>in that order.</p> 
<p>What you are <em>not</em> told is why you start with those two particular 
actions in that particular order.</p> 
<p>But by now, knowing about the hidden .svn administrative directory and what 
it does, you can probably figure that out.</p> 
<p>Import is the opposite of export. It takes a directory of files &mdash; a 
<em>clean copy</em> of the files, if you will &mdash; from your hard drive and 
copies them into the central Subversion repository on the server.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Always</em></strong> the next step is to do a checkout. 
Basically a checkout copies the project files from the central repository to a 
workingCopy directory on your PC. If the workingCopy directory does not exist 
on your PC, it is created.</p> 
<p>The workingCopy directory contains everything you need in order to be able 
to work with Subversion, including an .svn administrative directory. As the 
CollabNet documentation (quoted earlier) says:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>When you do a Subversion checkout, every folder and subfolder contains an 
.svn folder. These.svn folders contain clean copies of all files checked out 
and .tmp directories that contain temporary files created during checkouts, 
commits, update and other operations.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So the second step &mdash; the checkout command &mdash; is absolutely 
necessary in order to get started. It creates a workingCopy directory 
containing the project files. Only after that happens are your files properly 
&ldquo;under version control&rdquo;.</p> 
<p> <strong>checkin vs. commit</strong></p> 
<p>PVCS (and SourceSafe, and many other version control systems) work on a 
locking model. &ldquo;Checking out&rdquo; a file from the repository means that 
you get a local working copy of the file, and you lock the file in the 
repository. At that point, nobody can unlock it except you. Checking out a file 
gives you exclusive update privileges on it until you check it back in.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Checking in&rdquo; a file means that you copy your local working 
copy of the file back into the repository and you unlock the file in the 
repository.</p> 
<p>It is possible to copy your local working copy of the file into the 
repository<em>without</em> unlocking the file in the repository. When you do 
this, you are in a sense &ldquo;updating&rdquo; the repository from the working 
copy.</p> 
<p>Because of my familiarity with this kind of version control, I had a 
certain &ldquo;mental model&rdquo; of how a version control system works. And 
because of that mental model, many of the Subversion tutorials were quite 
confusing.</p> 
<p>One source of confusion is the fact that (as we will see in the next 
section) the word &ldquo;updating&rdquo; in the context of Subversion means<em>
exactly the opposite</em> of what it means in the context of PVCS.</p> 
<p>One of the Subversion tutorials that I found said that you must <em>checkout
</em> your workingCopy from the main repository, because you can&rsquo;t do a 
<em>checkin</em> back to the main repository if you hadn&rsquo;t checked it 
out. This was very confusing to an ex-PVCS user.</p> 
<p>First, it suggested that Subversion works like PVCS: that there is a 
typical round-trip usage pattern consisting of</p> 
<ul> 
<li>checking out (locking)</li> 
<li>editing</li> 
<li>checking in (unlocking)</li> </ul> 
<p>But Subversion doesn&rsquo;t work like this, at least not by default.</p> 
<p>What the tutorial was trying to say, I think, was that in order to work 
with Subversion, you must create a workingCopy directory (that is, a directory 
that contains an .svn administrative subdirectory). And the way to create a 
workingCopy directory is to run a<code>svn checkout</code> command against the 
repository on the server.</p> 
<p>Second, explaining things this way was confusing because Subversion 
doesn&rsquo;t really have a<code>checkin</code> command. It does have a <code>
commit</code> command, which some tutorials call a &ldquo;checkin&rdquo; 
command. But that command does<em>not</em> do the same thing as a PVCS <code>
checkin</code>.</p> 
<p>Ignore the fact that the short form of the <code>commit</code> command is 
<code>ci</code> (which stood for &ldquo;checkin&rdquo; in an earlier 
incarnation of Subversion). ASubversion &ldquo;checkin&rdquo; is the same thing 
as a &ldquo;commit&rdquo;, and has nothing to do with locking. It would really 
be helpful if all Subversion tutorials would stop using the term 
&ldquo;checkin&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;commit&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>If you are used to working with a VCS that uses the &ldquo;check out, edit, 
check in&rdquo; paradigm, and you come to understand that Subversion&rsquo;s<em>
commit</em> is not the same as your old familiar <em>check in</em>, then your 
next question will almost certainly be:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Once you checkout a project into a working folder, how do you check it in 
<em>a la</em> SourceSafe? [Or PVCS, or other lock-based VCSs?<em> -- Steve Ferg
</em>]</p> 
<p>I know there is &ldquo;commit&rdquo; which puts my changes into the 
respository, but I still have the files checked out under my working folder. 
What if I am done with a particular file and I don&rsquo;t want to have it 
checked out? How do I check it back in?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>You can read the answer here.</p> 
<p> <strong>What does <code>svn update</code> do?</strong></p> 
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: <em><code>svn update</code> updates the workingCopy, not 
the repository.</em></p> 
<p>The Subversion docs describe the <code>update</code> command this way:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>When working on a project with a team, you&rsquo;ll want to update your 
working copy to receive any changes other developers on the project have made 
since your last update. Use svn update to bring your working copy into sync 
with the latest revision in the repository:</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Basically, what the <code>update</code> command does is to copy the project 
files from the central repository down to the .svn directory in your 
workingCopy.</p> 
<p>This is something you should do frequently, because you don&rsquo;t want 
the files in your workingCopy/.svn directory to get too far out of sync with 
the file in the central repository. And you don&rsquo;t want to try to commit 
files if your workingCopy/.svn is out of sync with the central repository.</p> 
<p>That means that as a general rule, you should always run an <code>svn update
</code>:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>just before you start making a new round of changes to your workingCopy, 
and</li> 
<li> just before doing a commit.</li> </ul> 
<p> Now, having mastered the concept of an .svn directory, we can Understand 
Many Things, even arcana such as whyServing websites from svn checkout 
considered harmful.</p> 
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p> 
<p>This post contains information written by a Subversion newbie in the hopes 
that it will be useful to other Subversion newbies. But of course, having been 
written by a newb, there are all sorts of ways it could be wrong.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re a Subversion expert (and it doesn&rsquo;t take much to be 
more expert than I am) and you see something wrong, confused, or misleading 
here, please leave a comment. I, and future generations of Subversion newbies, 
will thank you for it.</p>

<p><strong>When programmable keyboards go bad</strong></p> 
<p>A while ago, one of my Northgate keyboards seemed spontaneously to sustain 
some kind of brain injury. A number of the keys seemed to have gone haywire. 
The left shift key didn&rsquo;t work and several pairs of keys seemed to have 
exchanged places.</p> 
<p>I talked with Bob Tibbetts of Northgate Keyboard repair (
http://www.northgate-keyboard-repair.com/) and he explained the situation. Here 
is what I learned.</p> 
<p>The Northgates are programmable keyboards &mdash; they contain a 
programmable chip. They were designed so that certain key combinations (e.g. 
pressing the left shift key four times) puts the keyboard (that is, the 
programmable chip) into programming mode.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately the programmable chip had software that worked only with 
Windows 98 and earlier. If you are using a Northgate keyboard with any other 
system, the programmable chip is basically a bad chip and should be removed. 
(Bob noted that he removes the chip from any keyboards that he sells.)</p> 
<p>Fixing the problem is a two-step process. First you &ldquo;reboot&rdquo; 
the keyboard into non-progamming mode, then you remove the chip.</p> 
<p>You can just reboot the keyboard without removing the chip, of course, and 
that will fix the immediate problem. But as long as the programmable chip is 
still in the keyboard, similar problems can occur again at any time.</p> 
<p><strong>How to &ldquo;reboot&rdquo; the programmable keyboard</strong></p> 
<p>Shut the computer down. Don&rsquo;t just a log off or do a 
&ldquo;soft&rdquo; reboot. Power off.</p> 
<p>Press the ESCAPE (ESC) key down and hold it down while you power up your 
PC. Do not release the ESC key until the computer beeps at you, or you have to 
do something like entering a password.</p> 
<p>This should make the computer work normally. (If it doesn&rsquo;t, then the 
problem was something other than the programmable chip.)</p> 
<p><strong>The anatomy of an Evolution keyboard</strong></p> 
<p>Working with Evolution keyboards is tricky because the Evolutions have the 
little GlidePoint touchpad in the middle of the top of the keyboard. There are 
short cables that go from the GlidePoint touchpad in the upper part of the 
keyboard to the &ldquo;motherboard&rdquo; in the bottom part of the keyboard.
</p> 
<p>Basically, the GlidePoint cables act as a sort of tether between the upper 
and lower halves of the keyboard. The cables are short, and virtually 
impossible to re-attach if you pull them loose. So you have to be careful not 
to pull them loose.</p> 
<p><strong>How to remove the programmable chip from an Evolution keyboard
</strong></p> 
<p>First, make sure you have read &ldquo;The anatomy of an Evolution 
keyboard&rdquo; (above). Then &hellip;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Reboot&rdquo; the keyboard (see the instructions given above), then 
shut down (power off) your PC.</p> 
<p>Turn the keyboard over, so that you are looking at the bottom of the 
keyboard.</p> 
<p>Take the six screws (the ones holding the upper and lower parts of the 
keyboard together) out of the keyboard.</p> 
<p>Turn the keyboard over, so that it is face up and you are looking at the 
keys.</p> 
<p>DO NOT lift the top off of the keyboard.</p> 
<p>Well, you can lift it a little.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the slideshow, you can see the top of the keyboard sitting on a little 
green box that lifts it about 2.75 inches (7 cm).&nbsp; You can see the 
GlidePoint cables running from the touchpad in the top of the keyboard to the 
motherboard in the bottom of the keyboard. Those are the cables that you 
don&rsquo;t want to disturb.</p> 
<p>Lift the top half of the keyboard just enough to free it from the bottom 
half, then rotate the top clockwise about 4 or 5 inches, just enough to expose 
the programmable chip. Rotate the top using the location of the touchpad as the 
pivot point &mdash; that way you will disturb the touchpad cables at little as 
possible.</p> 
<p>On the top right-hand side, locate the programmable chip. It is a small 
chip about 1/4&Prime; x 3/8&Prime; with 24C16 embossed on it.</p> 
<p>Take a small screwdriver and pry the chip out. When you do this, you may 
break a few of the prongs that hold the chip to the motherboard. That&rsquo;s 
OK. Bob Tibbetts suggested using a jeweler&rsquo;s screwdriver. I used a small 
(but long) electrician&rsquo;s screwdriver. I also found that once I had the 
chip lifted up, but not completely free of the motherboard, a needle-nose 
pliers was perfect for the final removal.</p> 
<p>Around the edges of the chip socket, carefully cut off any remaining 
prongs. The goal is to leave no prongs sticking up that might touch each other 
or anything else. I think a &ldquo;side cutter&rdquo; pliers would be too big 
for this job. Something like a toenail clipper might be about right. I had only 
one prong left stuck in the motherboard, and I gently twisted it off with the 
needle-nose pliers.</p> 
<p>Carefully lower the top of the keyboard back down onto the lower part.</p> 
<p>Carefully turn the keyboard over, making sure to keep the two halves of the 
keyboard together.</p> 
<p>Put the screws back in.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re done!</p> 
<p><strong>How to remove the programmable chip from a non-Evolution 
programmable keyboard</strong></p> 
<p>For other programmable Northgate keyboard models (models ending in a P for 
&ldquo;programmable&rdquo;) &mdash; 101P, 102P, Ultra TP and Ultra P &mdash; 
you can use basically the same procedure as described above for the Evolution.
</p> 
<p>The difference is that non-Evolution keyboards don&rsquo;t have the 
GlidePoint touchpad embedded in the top of the keyboard. That means that you 
don&rsquo;t need to worry about the GlidePoint cables, so you can lift the 
keyboard top completely off in order to access the programmable chip.</p>

<h3> Northgate keyboard&nbsp;repair </h3>  Filed under: Keyboards &mdash; 
Steve Ferg @ 1:51 am<br>

<p>The best computer keyboards ever made (even when compared to the original 
IBM model M keyboards) were the Northgate&nbsp;Omnikey keyboards.&nbsp; They 
were heavy keyboards&nbsp;built like tanks,&nbsp;featuring buckling spring 
key-switchesnotable for their distinctive clicking as you typed.&nbsp; These 
were real keyboards &mdash;no crappy &ldquo;rubber dome&rdquo; key switches 
allowed.</p> 
<p>Omnikey Ultra keyboard</p> 
<p>I used only Northgate&nbsp;Omnikey Ultras for years, lugging them from job 
to job like an itinerant medieval carpenter carrying his tools with him from 
town to town, and usingspecial keyboard plug adapters&nbsp;when 
keyboard&nbsp;plug design evolved first to PS/2 and then to USB.</p> 
<p>But tools get worn and dirty and a few years ago my Ultras were terminally 
filthy and starting to fail.&nbsp; That was when, thanks to the twin miracles 
of the Web and Google, I found Bob Tibbetts and hisNorthgate Keyboard Repair 
web site.&nbsp; Bob belongs to the school of minimalist website design, but his 
keyboard expertise and repair skills are totally maximal, and he really saved my
bacon keyboards.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also, in a manner of speaking, saved my wrists.
</p> 
<p>After 25 years of coding, the joints in my&nbsp;hands and wrists were 
starting to protest.&nbsp; I switched from using a mouse to a using a trackball 
(I prefer aLogitech Cordless Optical Trackman), and that helped a 
lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carpal tunnel syndrome forced a friend of mine to retire on 
disability and put The Fear into me.&nbsp; A bout of online research convinced 
me that we really need more ergonomic keyboards, so I went shopping for 
one.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The major feature of an ergonomic keyboard is a split design in which the 
left and right halves of the keyboard&nbsp; are split apart, separated by a few 
inches, and angled slightly so that you can type without bending your 
wrists.&nbsp; The result is a keyboard that is shaped like a V rather than like 
a straight unbroken line. In a sense, the keyboard is bent so your wrists 
don&rsquo;t have to be.</p> 
<p>Northgate Evolution keyboard</p> 
<p>What I really wanted, of course,&nbsp;was an ergonomic version of the 
Omnikey Ultra.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One day, in an email to Bob, I mentioned that although I loved my Ultras 
(one of which Bob was cleaning and repairing at the time),&nbsp;what I<em>really
</em>wished for was an ergonomic V-shaped version of the Ultra.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Well, I nearly fell off my chair when Bob told me that such a thing 
actually existed.&nbsp; It was called the Omnikey Evolution keyboard.&nbsp; 
Evolutions were very advanced for their time, and very few were made.&nbsp; But 
a few&nbsp;&mdash; new in the box&nbsp;&mdash; still existed, and he had a few 
for sale.</p> 
<p>I immediately ordered one, tried it out, and loved it.&nbsp; It is my 
favorite keyboard ever.&nbsp; So I followed my Mom&rsquo;s tongue in cheek 
advice (&ldquo;Get &lsquo;em before the hoarders do.&rdquo;) and got 
more.&nbsp; I now own 5 &ndash;&nbsp;one for work, one for my home Vista 
machine, one for my home Linux machine, and two backups.</p> 
<p>As I type this, it is almost midnight on&nbsp;March 11, 2011, and Bob has 
only 3 Evolution keyboards left.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The good news is that if you have a beloved old Northgate&nbsp;that is 
showing its age, Northgate&nbsp;Keyboard Repair is still in the business of 
cleaning and repairing Northgate keyboards.</p> 
<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re looking to purchase a keyboard with buckling 
spring key switches, you might check out the Customizer&nbsp;line of keyboards 
at&nbsp;pckeyboards.com.&nbsp; It is a reincarnation of the original IBM model 
M.</p>

<h3> Python&nbsp;runs&nbsp;JSD </h3>  Filed under: Python &amp; JSD &mdash; 
Steve Ferg @ 10:48 am<br>

<p>&#65279;&#65279;Of possible interest to those interested in systems 
analysis methodologies.</p> 
<p>http://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pyjsd/MissGrantsControllerInJSD.pdf
</p> 
<p>A synopsis&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Miss Grant&rsquo;s Controller: A JSD specification</strong></p> 
<p>For the purpose of writing computer software specifications, it is useful 
to view a computer software system as a software &ldquo;machine&rdquo; that 
transitions from state to state under the control of an input stream of events.
</p> 
<p>Traditionally, computer system specifications focus on the states and the 
transitions between the states: they view the system as a state machine and use 
state transition diagrams (STDs) to specify the behavior of the machine.</p> 
<p>In contrast, Jackson System Development (JSD) specifications focus on the 
events and the sequence in which the events may occur. JSD views a software 
machine as a simulation in which model processes (coroutines running inside the 
system) simulate real-world processes. The model processes running in the 
machine are synchronized with their real-world counterparts by means of events 
&ndash; events sent from the real-world processes into the machine. JSD uses<em>
action structure diagrams</em>to represent model processes.</p> 
<p>I (and others, of course) believe that JSD-style specifications are a more 
useful tool than STDs and state machines for specifying many systems.</p> 
<p>In this paper, I will present a small argument-by-example for JSD 
event-oriented specifications.</p> 
<p>My example problem will be &ldquo;Miss Grant&rsquo;s controller&rdquo;, 
which is based on an example problem from the introduction to Martin 
Fowler&rsquo;s new (2010) book<em>Domain-Specific Languages</em>.<br>
 &hellip;.
</p> 
<p>Since the 1980&prime;s, JSD experts have had a vision of <em>executable JSD 
specifications</em>. They were frustrated by the fact that a JSD model process 
is a coroutine, but COBOL &ndash; the programming language in use in the 
business community where JSD was most popular &ndash; did not support 
coroutines.</p> 
<p>That situation has changed in the last few years, with the increasing 
acceptance ofPython. Python, it turns out, is the ideal language for creating 
executable JSD specifications.</p> 
<p>This is what Miss Grant&rsquo;s controller looks like when the action 
structure diagram is translated into Python.<br>
 &hellip;</p> 
<p>To run the model, we need to create some test data &ndash; a stream of 
sensor events &ndash; that we can feed to the controller. So here is the code 
for a Python driver program that creates a sequence of event objects and feeds 
them to the Python specification for Miss Grant&rsquo;s controller.<br>
 
&hellip;</p> 
<p>Here is the output produced by a test run.<br>

<h3> PyCharm&nbsp;gotchas </h3>  Filed under: Miscellaneous &mdash; Steve Ferg 
@ 11:39 pm<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with PyCharm, the new Python IDE.&nbsp; I like 
it&nbsp;a lot.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve discovered a few&nbsp;<strong>major 
</strong>gotchas.</p> 
<p>I should note that I come from a Windows background, and I&rsquo;m used to 
standard Windows keyboard shortcuts and editor behavior.&nbsp; So what 
I&rsquo;m going to describe may be standard behavior for editors&nbsp;on *nix, 
and nothing surprising to say, Ubuntu programmers.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m working 
on Windows, and on Windows PyCharm&rsquo;s out-of-the-box configuration of 
keyboard shortcuts is definitely a big gotcha.</p> 
<p>First of all, on Windows ctl+z is the standard shortcut key for UNDO, and 
ctl+y is the standard shortcut key for REDO (or in some contexts, DO 
AGAIN).&nbsp; But in the default PyCharm configuration, ctl+y is not REDO but 
DELETE LINE.&nbsp; Imagine&nbsp;trying to REDO a series of commands by 
repeatedly punching ctl+y&hellip; &nbsp;and watching your source code 
evaporate!&nbsp; That was me, brother.</p> 
<p>Second, on most Windows editors (and things like Netbeans and Eclipse, too) 
if you try to close a file that has unsaved changes, the editor will warn you 
and ask you what you want to do.&nbsp; Not so PyCharm.&nbsp; If you click on a 
tab to close a file (a file with unsaved changes), PyCharm saves the file and 
closes it.&nbsp; No warnings.&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As I write this, I realize that<em> I don&rsquo;t know </em>how to tell 
PyCharm to close a file without also writing it to disk.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Third, PyCharm offers several alternate keyboard shortcut 
configurations&hellip; but they all seem to be *nix inspired.&nbsp; There is no 
pre-built alternate shortcut configuration for Windows-like behavior.&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>On the upside, though, PyCharm provides a lot of support for&nbsp; keyboard 
shortcut customization, and you can customize the keyboard shortcuts to the 
behavior that you want.&nbsp; The PyCharm online documentation is good, and 
detailed.&nbsp; Very well done.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Some time I might blog about what I like about PyCharm.&nbsp; As I say, 
there is a lot to like about PyCharm and I don&rsquo;t want to slam 
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider this a heads-up.</p> Comments (6) <br>

<h3> A Globals&nbsp;Module&nbsp;pattern </h3>  Filed under: Globals and 
containers &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 11:01 pm <br>

<p>Two comments on my recent posts on a Globals Class pattern for Python and an
Arguments Container pattern&nbsp;reminded me that there is one more container 
for globals that is worth noting: the module.</p> 
<p>The idea is a simple one. You can use a module as a container.</p> 
<p>Most introductions to Python tell you all about how to get stuff &mdash; 
that is, how to import stuff &mdash; *from* imported modules. They talk very 
little about writing stuff *to* imported modules. But it can be done.</p> 
<p>Here is a simple example.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the intended container module, mem.py. I&rsquo;d 
show you the contents of mem.py, except for the fact that there aren&rsquo;t 
any. mem.py is empty.</p> 
<p>Next let&rsquo;s look at two modules that import and use mem.py.</p> 
<p>The caller module is leader.py. Note that it imports mem and also imports 
the subordinate module, minion.&nbsp; (Note the use of the print() function; 
we&rsquo;re running Python 3 here.)</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>&quot;leader.py&quot; import mem import minion mem.x = &quot;foo&quot; 
print(&quot;leader says:&quot;,mem.x) minion.main() print(&quot;leader 
says:&quot;,mem.x) print() mem.x = &quot;bar&quot; print(&quot;leader 
says:&quot;,mem.x) minion.main() print(&quot;leader says:&quot;,mem.x)</pre> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The subordinate module is minion.py.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>&quot;minion.py&quot; import mem def main(): print(&quot;minion 
says:&quot;,mem.x) mem.x = &quot;value reset by minion from &quot; + mem.x</pre>
</blockquote> 
<p>If you run leader.py it imports minion and mem, and uses mem as a container 
for variable x.&nbsp; It assigns a value to x in mem and calls minion, which 
reads mem.x and resets mem.x&rsquo;s value, which leader then reads.</p> 
<p>When you run leader.py, you see this output:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>leader says: foo minion says: foo leader says: value reset by minion from 
foo leader says: bar minion says: bar leader says: value reset by minion from 
bar</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>Note that leader.py passes no arguments to minion.main() and minion.main() 
doesn&rsquo;t return anything (other than None, of course). Leader and minion 
communicate solely by means of the variables set in mem. And the communication 
is clearly two-way. Leader sets values that minion reads, and minion sets 
values that leader reads.</p> 
<p>So what we have here, in mem, is a truly global container. It is not 
&ldquo;module global&rdquo; as in theGlobals Class pattern. It is 
&ldquo;application global&rdquo; &mdash; it is global across the multiple 
modules that make up an application.&nbsp; In order to gain access to this 
container, modules&nbsp;simply import it.</p> 
<p>In keeping with the earlier posts&rsquo; grandiosity, I will call this use 
of an imported module the<strong> Globals Module </strong>pattern.</p> 
<p>Every Python programmer is familiar with one special case of the Globals 
Module pattern. Just rename mem.py to config.py, stuff it with a bunch of 
constants or configuration variables, and you have a typical Python file for 
defining constants or setting configuration values. These values are 
&ldquo;application global&rdquo;, available to all module in an application. 
All they have to do is to import config.py.</p> 
<p>Doing a bit of arm-waving, and christening a <strong>Globals Module 
</strong>pattern, does one thing.&nbsp; It reminds us that modules &mdash; used 
as containers for &ldquo;application global&rdquo; values 
&ndash;&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t limited to supplying&nbsp;constants and pre-set 
values. Modules can also be written to.&nbsp; The communication between 
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; modules and Globals Modules is a two-way street.</p> Leave

<h3> An Arguments&nbsp;Container&nbsp;pattern </h3>  Filed under: Globals and 
containers &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 11:32 am <br>

<p>In a comment on my earlier post A Globals Class pattern for Python, Mike 
M&uuml;ller wrote<br>
 &ldquo;No need for globals. Just explicitly pass your 
container. In my opinion this is much easier to understand.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Mike&rsquo;s comment led me to some further thoughts on the subject.</p> 
<p>Suppose you have a number of things &mdash; x, y, and z &mdash; that you 
want to make available to many functions in a module.</p> 
<p>There are four strategies that you could use. You could</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1. pass x, y, and z as individual arguments<br>
 2. make x, y, and z globals
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>or you could create a container C of some sort and</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>3. pass container C as an argument<br>
 4. make container C a global</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>So you have two basic questions to answer. When you make the things &mdash; 
x, y, and z &mdash; available:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A. Do you make them available in global variables, or in arguments that you 
pass around?</p> 
<p>B. Do you make them available individually, or do you put them in some kind 
of container and make the container available?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>My original post assumed that in at least some situations you might answer 
question A with &ldquo;use global variables&rdquo; and then went on to propose 
that in those situations the best answer to B is &ldquo;put them in a 
container&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Since the point of that post was to point out the usefulness of a class as 
a container, I called the proposed pattern the<strong>Globals Class </strong>
pattern. But in most cases some other kind of container would do as well as a 
class. I could almost as easily have called the pattern the<strong>Globals 
Container</strong>pattern.</p> 
<p>So if you look at these two questions &mdash; A and B &mdash; I think it is 
interesting where Mike and I differ, and where we agree.</p> 
<h1>Question A: args or globals</h1> 
<p>Where we differ, if you could call it that, is in the answer to A.</p> 
<p>Mike wrote &ldquo;No need for globals. Just explicitly pass your container. 
In my opinion this is much easier to understand.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In my post I wrote &ldquo;Sometimes globals are the best practical solution 
to a particular programming problem.&rdquo; But that wasn&rsquo;t really what 
the post was about. It was about the answer to question B.</p> 
<p>So I can&rsquo;t really say that Mike and I disagree very much. He says 
&ldquo;I like apples&rdquo;. I say &ldquo;Sometimes I like an 
orange.&rdquo;&nbsp; No big deal.</p> 
<h1>Question B &mdash; multiple things or a single container</h1> 
<p>What is much more interesting is that we both agree on the answer to 
question B: use a container object.</p> 
<p>But since I was talking about globals, I was talking about a container for 
<em>globals</em>. &nbsp;Since Mike was talking about arguments, he was talking 
about a container for<em>arguments</em>.</p> 
<p>Which means that we have two different patterns. My earlier post was about 
&#65279;strategy 4 &ndash;&nbsp;a<strong>Globals Container </strong>pattern. 
Mike is talking about strategy 3 &mdash; what we might call an<strong>Arguments 
Container</strong>pattern.</p> 
<p>As it happens, I had stumbled onto the <strong>Arguments Container </strong>
pattern myself, not in Python but in Java. The circumstances were very similar 
to the circumstances that led to the Python<strong>Globals Class</strong> 
pattern. I had a lot of variables that I needed to pass around. As the code 
evolved,the argument lists got longer and harder to manage. Finally I just 
bundled all of the variables into a single container object and passed the 
container around. As I needed to add new arguments, I was able to add them to 
just one place &mdash; the container.</p> 
<p>At the time, I felt sort of stupid doing this. I hadn&rsquo;t ever heard of 
this as a programming technique.&nbsp; It smacked of sneaking global variables 
in through the back door, and of course everybody knows that globals are always 
bad. But it worked, and it made my life a lot easier.</p> 
<p>So now Mike comes along and proposes doing exactly the same thing. I feel 
relieved. I&rsquo;m not the only one doing this. It may even be a Good Thing.
</p> 
<p>So I&rsquo;m happy to announce &mdash; not the discovery, certainly &mdash; 
the christening of the<strong>Arguments Container </strong>pattern, which says, 
basically:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>Sometimes when you have a lot of individual variables that you need to 
pass around to a lot of different functions or methods, the best solution is to 
put them into a container object and just pass the container object around.</em>
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is not a specifically Python pattern. And in a way it is No Big Deal. 
But I&rsquo;m doing a bit of shouting and arm-waving here because I think that 
somewhere there is probably at least one person for whom this post might be 
useful.</p> Comments (5) <br>

<h3> A Globals Class&nbsp;pattern&nbsp;for&nbsp;Python </h3>  Filed under: 
Globals and containers &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 11:10 pm <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gradually been evolving a technique of coding in which I put 
module globals in a class. Recently I stumbled across Norman Matloff&rsquo;s
Python tutorial in which he recommends doing exactly the same thing, and it 
dawned on me that this technique constitutes a truly idiomatic Python design 
pattern.</p> 
<p>A pattern needs a short, catchy name. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has yet 
given this pattern a name, so I will propose the name<strong>Globals Class
</strong> pattern.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that many experienced Python programmers are already quietly 
using the<strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern. They may not see much point in 
making a big deal about it, or in giving it a name and decking it out with the 
fancy title of &ldquo;design pattern&rdquo;. But I think a little bit of hoopla 
is in order. This is a useful technique, and one worth pointing out for the 
benefit of those who have not yet discovered it.&nbsp; A bit of cheering and 
arm-waving is in order, simply to catch some attention.</p> 
<p>The technique is extremely simple.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You define a class at the beginning of your module.&nbsp; This makes the 
class global.</li> 
<li>Then, all of the names that you would otherwise declare global, you 
specify as attributes of the class.</li> </ul> 
<p>Really, there is virtually nothing class-like about this class; for 
instance, you probably will never instantiate it. Instead of functioning like a 
true class, it functions as a simple container object.</p> 
<p>I like to use the name &ldquo;mem&rdquo; (in my mind, short for 
&ldquo;GlobalMemory&rdquo;) for this class, but of course you can use any name 
you prefer.</p> 
<p>All you really need is a single line of code.</p> 
<pre> class mem: pass</pre> 
<p>That is enough to create your <em>mem</em> container. Then you can use it 
wherever you like.</p> 
<pre> def doSomething(): mem.counter = 0 ... def doMore(): mem.counter += 1 
... def doSomethingElse(): if mem.counter &gt; 0: ...</pre> 
<p>If you wish, you can initialize the global variables when you create the 
class. In our example, we could move the initialization of<em>mem.counter</em> 
out of the doSomething() function and put it in the definition of the<em>mem 
</em>class.</p> 
<pre> class mem: counter = 0</pre> 
<p>In a more elaborate version of this technique, you can define a <em>Mem 
</em>class, complete with methods, and make <em>mem </em>an instance of the 
class. Sometimes this can be handy.</p> 
<pre> class Mem: def __init__(self): self.stupidErrorsCount = 0 
self.sillyErrorsCount = 0 def getTotalErrorsCount(self): return 
self.stupidErrorsCount + self.sillyErrorsCount # instantiate the Mem class to 
create a global mem object mem = Mem()</pre> 
<h1>What&rsquo;s the point?</h1> 
<p>So, what does the <strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern buy you?</p> 
<p>1. First of all, you don&rsquo;t have to go putting &ldquo;global&rdquo; 
statements all over your code.&nbsp; &#65279;&#65279; &#65279;The beauty of 
using a globals class is that you don&rsquo;t need to have<strong>any</strong> 
&ldquo;global&rdquo; statements in you code.</p> 
<p>There was a&nbsp;time &mdash; in the past, when I still used 
&ldquo;global&rdquo; &mdash; when I might find myself in a situation where my 
code was evolving and I needed to create more and more global variables. In a 
really bad case I might have a dozen functions, each of which declared a dozen 
global variables. The code was as ugly as sin and a maintenance 
nightmare.&nbsp; But the nightmare stopped when I started putting all of my 
formerly global variables into a global class like<em>mem.</em>&nbsp; I simply 
stopped using &ldquo;global&rdquo; and got rid of all those 
&ldquo;global&rdquo; statements that were cluttering up my code.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So the moral of my story is this.&nbsp; Kids, don&rsquo;t be like me.&nbsp; 
I started out using &ldquo;global&rdquo; and had to change.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a 
recovering &ldquo;global&rdquo; user.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t you even start.&nbsp; Skip the section on the 
&ldquo;global&rdquo; keyword in your copy of<em>Beginners Guide to Learning 
Python for Dummies</em>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;global&rdquo; at 
all.&nbsp; Just use a globals class.</p> 
<p>2. I like the fact that you can easily tell when a variable is global 
simply by noticing the<em>mem.</em> modifier.</p> 
<p>3. The globals statement is redundant.&nbsp; The <strong>Globals Class
</strong> pattern relieves us of of the burden of having to worry about it.</p> 
<p>Python has the quirk that if X is a global, and a function only reads X, 
then within the function, X is global. But if the function assigns a value to 
X, X is treated as local.</p> 
<p>So suppose that &mdash; as your code evolves &mdash; you add an assignment 
statement deep in the bowels of the function. The statement assigns a value to 
X. Then you have &mdash; as a side-effect of the addition of that statement 
&mdash; converted X (within the scope of the function) from a global to a local.
</p> 
<p>You might or might not want to have done that.&nbsp; You might not even 
realize what you&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you<em>do </em>realize what 
you&rsquo;ve done, you probably need to add<em>another </em>statement to the 
function, specifying that X is global.&nbsp; That is sort of a language wart. 
If you use the<strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern, you avoid that wart.</p> 
<p>4. I think the use of the <strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern makes the 
work of static code analyzers (e.g. PyFlakes) easier.</p> 
<p>5. The <strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern makes it possible to create 
multiple, distinct groups of globals.</p> 
<p>This can be useful sometimes. I have had modules that processed nested 
kinds of things: A, B, and C. It was helpful to have different groups of 
globals for the different kinds of things.</p> 
<pre> class memA: pass class memB: pass class memC: pass</pre> 
<p>6. Finally, the <strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern makes it possible to 
pass your globals as arguments.</p> 
<p>I have had the situation where a module grew to the point where it needed 
to be split into two modules. But the modules still needed to share a common 
global memory. With the<strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern, a module&rsquo;s 
globals are actually attributes of an object, a globals class.&nbsp; In Python, 
classes are first-class objects.&nbsp; That means that a<strong>globals class
</strong> can be passed &mdash; as a parameter &mdash; from a function in one 
module to a function in another module.</p> 
<h1>Is this really A Good Thing?</h1> 
<p>At this point I can hear a few stomachs churning. Mine is one of them. 
Because, as we all know,<em>Global Variables are Always a Bad Thing</em>.</p> 
<p>But that proposition is debatable.&nbsp; In any event, it is an issue that 
I&rsquo;m not going to explore here.&nbsp; For now, I prefer to take a 
practical, pragmatic position:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sometimes globals are the best practical solution to a particular 
programming problem.</li> 
<li>For the occasions when <em>Globals are A Good Thing</em>, it is handy to 
have a way to<em>Do Globals in A Good Way</em>.</li> </ul> 
<p>So the bottom line for me is that there are occasions when some kind of 
globals-like technique is the best tool for the job.&nbsp; And on those 
occasions the<strong>Globals Class</strong> pattern is a better tool for the 
job than globals themselves.</p> Comments (8) <br>

<h3> Command-line syntax: some basic&nbsp;concepts </h3>  Filed under: 
Miscellaneous &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 10:45 pm <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading about parsers for command-line arguments lately, 
for examplePlac. And, as Michele Simionato says:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There is no want of command line arguments parsers in the Python world. The 
standard library alone contains three different modules: getopt (from the stone 
age),optparse (from Python 2.3) and argparse (from Python 2.7).</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>My reading has made me realize that there is an immense range of possible 
syntaxes for command-line arguments, and far less consensus and standardization 
than I thought. Although there are some general styles that programmers often 
use when implementing the command-line arguments for their applications, 
basically every programmer is free to do whatever he (or she) wants. The result 
is that whenever you encounter an application for the first time, you 
can&rsquo;t safely assume anything about the syntax of its command-line 
arguments.</p> 
<p>It also has made me wonder if anyone had ever written an overview of, or 
introduction to, the basic concepts involved in command line arguments. I 
searched the Web without finding one, so I thought it would be interesting to 
try to write one.&nbsp; I can live with the risk that I&rsquo;m re-inventing 
the wheel.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Of course, there may be something out there and I just missed it. So if you 
know of some other discussion of this topic, please leave a comment and tell me 
about it. And if there is something that I missed here, I&rsquo;d appreciate a 
comment about that too.</p> </blockquote> 
<h2>What is a command line argument?</h2> 
<p>When you invoke an application from a command line, it is often useful to 
be able to send one or more pieces of information from the command line to the 
application. As a simple example, we might want to start a text editor and also 
tell it the name of a file that it should open, like this</p> 
<pre> superedit a_filename.txt</pre> 
<p>In this example, &ldquo;superedit&rdquo; is the name of the application, 
and &ldquo;a_filename.txt&rdquo; is a command line argument: in this case, the 
name of a file.</p> 
<h2>It is possible to supply more than one command line argument</h2> 
<p>We often want to send an application multiple arguments, like this:</p> 
<pre> rename file_a.txt file_b.txt</pre> 
<h2>Positional arguments, named arguments, and flags</h2> 
<p>There are three types of command line argument: positional arguments, named 
arguments, and flags.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A positional argument is a bare value, and its position in a list of 
arguments identifies it.</li> 
<li>A named argument is a (key, value) pair, where the key identifies the 
value.</li> 
<li>A flag is a stand-alone key, whose presence or absence provides 
information to the application.</li> </ul> 
<p>If we supplied the &ldquo;rename&rdquo; application with two positional 
arguments, like this</p> 
<pre> rename file_a.txt file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>then the position of the arguments identifies the value.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The value in position 1 (&ldquo;file_a.txt&rdquo;) is the current name of 
the file.</li> 
<li>The value in position 2 (&ldquo;file_b.txt&rdquo;) is the requested new 
name of the file.</li> </ul> 
<p>We could have written the &ldquo;rename&rdquo; application so that it 
requires two named arguments, like this</p> 
<pre> rename -oldname file_a.txt -newname file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>A flag is an argument whose presence alone is enough to convey information 
to the application. A good example is the frequently-used &ldquo;-v&rdquo; or
<code>&quot;--verbose&quot;</code> argument.</p> 
<p>Although it is possible to think of flags as degenerate named arguments 
(named arguments that have a key but no value), I find it easier to think of 
flags as a distinct type of argument, different from named arguments.</p> 
<h2>Keyword arguments and options</h2> 
<p>I will use the term <em>keyword argument</em> to cover both named arguments 
and flags.</p> 
<p>David Goodger notes (in the first&nbsp;comment on the first version of this 
post) that&nbsp;I am not using the traditional Unix command-line lexicon.&nbsp; 
What I have called<em>keyword arguments</em> are &mdash; on Unix platforms 
&mdash; traditionally called<em>options;&nbsp;</em> what I have called <em>
values</em> are traditionally called <em>option arguments;</em> and what I have 
called<em>positional arguments</em>, the Open Group calls <em>operands.</em>
&nbsp; So I should probably say something about my choice of technical 
terminology.</p> 
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, I prefer not to use the traditional Unix 
vocabulary of<em>options</em>, for a number of reason.&nbsp; First of 
all,&nbsp;the term<em>option</em> tends to be Unix-specific; on Windows the term
<em>parameter</em> is more frequently&nbsp;used.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the 
investigation began with command-line parsers, and in the context of a 
discussion of parsers and parsing,&nbsp;<em>keyword argument</em> seems&nbsp;a 
more traditional and appropriate term&nbsp;than<em>option</em>.&nbsp; Third, 
the usual definition of<em>option</em> is not very useful.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>Arguments are options if they begin with a hyphen.</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>And finally, the term <em>option</em> implies optionality.&nbsp; 
Whether&nbsp;an argument is optional or required is a semantic issue rather 
than a syntactical issue.&nbsp; At this point I&rsquo;m interested 
in&nbsp;syntactical issues, so I want to use a semantically neutral 
vocabulary.&nbsp; We can talk about options and optionality later, when we look 
at semantic concepts.</p> 
<h2>Keyword arguments require a sigil</h2> 
<p>When keyword arguments are used, there must be some mechanism for 
distinguishing a key from a value or from a positional argument. That mechanism 
is a &ldquo;sigil&rdquo;: a special character or string of characters that 
indicates the beginning of a key. In our example, the sigil was a dash (a 
hyphen).</p> 
<p>On Windows, the sigil is typically a forward slash: &ldquo;/&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>On Unix-like operating systems, the sigil is typically a dash <code>
&quot;-&quot;.</code></p> 
<p>Some applications use multiple sigils.&nbsp; With the plus sign 
&ldquo;+&rdquo;&nbsp;as a sigil, for instance, it is possible to use flags to 
turn options on and off.</p> 
<pre> attrib -readonly -archive file_A.txt attrib +readonly +archive file_A.txt
</pre> 
<h2>Single-character and multi-character keys</h2> 
<p>Some applications, especially on Unix, make a distinction between 
single-character keys and multi-character keys (&ldquo;long options&rdquo;), 
with a single-dash sigil<code>&quot;-&quot;</code> indicating the beginning of 
a single-character key, and a double dash<code>&quot;--&quot;</code> sigil 
indicating the beginning of a multi-character key. Often, an application will 
support both single-character and multi-character keys for the same argument. 
For example, the &ldquo;rename&rdquo; application might accept both this</p> 
<pre> rename -o file_a.txt -n file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>and this</p> 
<pre> rename --oldname file_a.txt --newname file_b.txt</pre> 
<h2>Fixed-length and variable-length keys</h2> 
<p>The previous section describes what I think most Unix programmers would say 
is the difference between single-dash and double-dash keys. But I think it is 
actually wrong.</p> 
<p>The <em>real</em> difference between a single-dash sigil <code>&quot;-&quot;
</code> and a double dash <code>&quot;--&quot;</code> sigil is not the 
difference between<em>one</em> and <em>many</em>, but the difference between 
<em>fixed-length</em> and <em>variable-length</em> keys. (This is obscured by 
the fact that a single-character key is also automatically a fixed-length key.)
</p> 
<p>The thing that really makes keys that begin with a single dash different 
from keys that begin with a double dash is not that they are one character 
long, but that their length is fixed and known. For example, flag concatenation 
(see below) is possible because the flag keys have a known and fixed length. It 
doesn&rsquo;t depend on the flag keys being one character long &mdash; it would 
work just as well if the length for flag keys was fixed at two or even three 
characters. And this is also true of the third technique for distinguishing 
keys from argument values (see the next section).</p> 
<h2>Named arguments require a mechanism to distinguish keys from argument 
values</h2> 
<p>One technique is to use whitespace to separate argument values from keys. 
We saw this in our earlier example</p> 
<pre> rename -o file_a.txt -n file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>A second technique is to use a special (non-whitespace) character to 
separate argument values from keys. This special character could be any 
character that cannot occur in either the key or argument value.</p> 
<p>On Unix, this is traditionally an equal sign &ldquo;=&rdquo;, like this.</p>
<pre> rename -o=file_a.txt -n=file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>On Windows and MS-DOS this is traditionally a colon &ldquo;:&rdquo;, like 
this.</p> 
<pre> rename /o:file_a.txt /n:file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>An application might permit whitespace before and after the equal sign, 
like this.</p> 
<pre> rename -o = file_a.txt -n = file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>A third technique is to use the known length of the key to distinguish the 
key from the argument value. Suppose the &ldquo;rename&rdquo; application uses 
only 1-character keys. Then it might accept arguments like this.</p> 
<pre> rename -ofile_a.txt -nfile_b.txt</pre> 
<h2>Fixed-length keys make flag concatenation possible</h2> 
<p>Suppose that an application follows the convention that a single-dash sigil 
signals the start of a single-character flag argument. Then it can accept 
either this</p> 
<pre> tar -x -v -f some_filename.tar</pre> 
<p>or this, where several flag arguments are specified together</p> 
<pre> tar -xvf some_filename.tar</pre> 
<p>Here is where the distinction between the single-dash sigil and the 
double-dash sigil becomes important.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><code>&quot;-xvf&quot; </code>indicates the concatenation of three 
single-character flags: &ldquo;x&rdquo;, &ldquo;v&rdquo;, and &ldquo;f&rdquo;.
</li> 
<li><code>&quot;--xvf&quot;</code> (note the double dash) indicates a single 
multi-character flag: &ldquo;xvf&rdquo;.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Parsing the command line</h2> 
<p>In many of the examples that we&rsquo;ve seen, parsing the command line is 
as simple as splitting it on whitespace. But the situation gets more 
complicated if values can contain whitespace. If that is true, then we need to 
support delimiters that can enclose values that contain whitespace.</p> 
<p>Suppose we want to invoke a word-processor from the command line. And we 
want to specify two arguments on the command line: the name of the file, and 
the name of the author.<em>This</em> obviously will not work.</p> 
<pre> superedit A Christmas Story.doc Clement Moore</pre> 
<p>What we need is <em>this</em>.</p> 
<pre> superedit &quot;A Christmas Story.doc&quot; &quot;Clement Moore&quot;
</pre> 
<p>Support of quoted values means that command-line parsers must be more 
sophisticated&hellip; just splitting the command line on whitespace won&rsquo;t 
do the job. The command-line parser must recognize and correctly handle quote 
characters&hellip; and escaped quote characters inside of quoted strings.</p> 
<p>The most common delimiter for argument values is the double-quote symbol. 
But we might also (or instead) want to support single quotes, back ticks, 
parentheses, or square/wavy/pointy brackets. We can imagine a case in which a 
malevolent programmer wrote superedit to expect positional arguments like this.
</p> 
<pre> superedit (A Christmas Story.doc) (Clement Moore)</pre> 
<p>&hellip; or named arguments like this.</p> 
<pre> superedit filename(A Christmas Story.doc) author(Clement Moore)</pre> 
<h2>Sigils in positional arguments</h2> 
<p>Remember our &ldquo;rename&rdquo; application? It accepted arguments like 
this, where the dash is the sigil that introduces the key of a named argument.
</p> 
<pre> rename -o file_a.txt -n file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>But filenames can begin with dashes. We might need to write a command like 
this, which would cause problems.</p> 
<pre> rename -o -file_a.txt -n -file_b.txt</pre> 
<p>So this is another reason why we might need to be able to quote argument 
values: to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; a sigil character inside a value.</p> 
<pre> rename -o &quot;-file_a.txt&quot; -n &quot;-file_b.txt&quot;</pre> 
<h2>The order of arguments</h2> 
<p>In the first version of this post, I wrote that:<br>
<em><br>
</em></p> 
<blockquote> <em> It is a universally observed convention that 
<ul> 
<li>keyword arguments (named arguments and flags) are grouped together</li> 
<li>positional arguments are grouped together</li> 
<li>keyword arguments must be specified first, before specifying positional 
arguments</li> </ul> </em> </blockquote> <em> </em> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>But that is wrong. It is a <em>widely</em> &mdash; but not universally 
&mdash; observed convention. As Eric wrote, in a comment on the first version 
of this post,<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> many modern programs allow keyword arguments to be specified 
after (or even between) positional arguments
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<p>And even very old programs do it too. The command-line syntax for Microsoft 
DOS&rsquo;s<em>dir</em> command (roughly equivalent to Unix&rsquo;s <em>ls</em> 
command) is basically</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>dir </strong> [filename] [switches]</p> </blockquote> 
<p> with the <em>filename </em>positional argument appearing before the 
switches.</p> 
<h2>A separator between keyword arguments and positional arguments</h2> 
<p>Suppose we have an application &ldquo;myprog&rdquo; that accepts one or 
more keyword arguments that start with a dash sigil, followed by one or more 
positional arguments that supply filenames. And suppose that filenames can 
contain &mdash; and begin with &mdash; dashes.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a problem if we code this</p> 
<pre> myprog -v -r -t -file_a.txt -file_b.txt -file_c.txt</pre> 
<p>myprog is going to see &ldquo;-file_a.txt&rdquo; and (since it starts with 
a dash, the sigil) myprog will try to handle it like a keyword argument. Not 
good.</p> 
<p>We could deal with this problem by routinely enclosing all filename 
positional arguments in quotes, but that would be clumsy and laborious.</p> 
<pre> myprog -v -r -t &quot;-file_a.txt&quot; &quot;-file_b.txt&quot; 
&quot;-file_c.txt&quot;</pre> 
<p>An alternative is to use a special string (typically double dashes <code>
&quot;--&quot;</code>) to indicate the beginning of positional arguments.</p> 
<pre> myprog -v -r -t -- -file_a.txt -file_b.txt -file_c.txt</pre> 
<p>So now we have <em><strong>four</strong></em> basic kinds of arguments.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>positional arguments</li> 
<li>named arguments (key+value pairs)</li> 
<li>flags</li> 
<li>an indicator of the beginning of positional arguments (<code>&quot;--&quot;
</code>)</li> </ul> 
<h2>Argument semantics</h2> 
<p><em>To be expanded&hellip;</em></p> 
<p>Optional arguments vs. required argments</p> 
<p>Relationships between different arguments</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Aliases</li> 
<li>Mutual exclusion</li> 
<li>Mutual necessity</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Other variations</h2> 
<p>In some conventions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Multi-character keys may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviations are 
unique.</li> 
<li>The value in a named argument is optional and may be omitted.</li> 
<li>The value of a named argument may be a list, with items in the list 
separated by a colon or a comma.</li> 
<li>A sigil character&nbsp;standing by itself (e.g. a single dash) is treated 
as a positional argument.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Command-line as a programming language</h2> 
<p>I think that the best way to think of a command-line, and its arguments, is 
as a statement in a command-line (CL) programming language, where each 
application defines its own CL language.</p> 
<p>This means that &mdash; as far as an application is concerned &mdash; the 
process of using command-line arguments always looks like this:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>define (i.e. tell the parsing module about) the syntax rules of the CL 
language to be used</li> 
<li>define (i.e. tell the parsing module about) the semantics of the CL 
language</li> 
<li>call the parser to parse the command line and its arguments</li> 
<li>query the parser for information about the &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; (the 
command-line arguments) that it found</li> </ol> 
<p>Step 2 &mdash; specifying the CL semantics &mdash; is the step in which the 
application specifies (for example) what named arguments and flags it accepts, 
and which are required. This step is necessary for the parser to do certain 
kinds of semantic checking: (for example) to automatically reject unrecognized 
keys, or to automatically report required arguments that were not provided.</p> 
<p>Step 2 can be omitted, but only if the application itself will do the 
semantic checking rather than expecting the parsing module to do it.</p> 
<p>The upside of doing step 2 is that it enables a smart CL parsing module 
automatically to generate user documentation for the CL language, and to dump 
that documentation to the screen when it finds a syntactic or semantic error in 
the command line, or when the command line is a request (e.g. &ldquo;/?&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;-h&rdquo;) for the command-line documentation.</p> 
<h2>Command-line meta-languages</h2> 
<p>CL languages are like markup languages. You can invent your own from 
scratch if you wish, but life is a lot easier if you at least follow some 
standard conventions when you do.</p> 
<p>In the world of markup languages, such standard conventions are called 
meta-languages. The best-known markup meta-language is XML. XML is not a markup 
language; it is a markup<em>meta-language</em> &hellip; roughly: a style, or 
set of conventions, or template for creating specific markup languages.</p> 
<p>XML is well-defined by the W3C. It would make sense to have similarly 
well-defined, carefully specified meta-languages for CL languages. Right now, I 
think we have two loosely-defined CL meta-languages, which I shall refer to as
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>WinCL (for Windows)</li> 
<li>NixCl (for *nix platforms)</li> </ul> 
<p>Traditionally (see the Wikipedia article on command line argument)</p> 
<ul> 
<li>WinCL uses a slash as the sigil; NixCL uses a dash.</li> 
<li>WinCL uses a colon as a key/value separator; NixCL uses an equal sign.</li>
<li>WinCL keywords traditionally consist of a single letter; NixCL is open to 
multi-character keywords (GNU &ldquo;long options&rdquo;).</li> </ul> 
<p>As of July 25, 2010,:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>WinCL is specified by Microsoft at 
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee156811.aspx</li> 
<li>NixCL is specified by the Open Group at 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.htmlandand by 
GNU athttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html.
</li> </ul> 
<p>If it is (or becomes) possible to consider WinCL and NixCL to be 
well-defined CL meta-languages, then the first step of specifying a CL language 
for an application (which I gave earlier):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>define (i.e. tell the parsing module about) the syntax rules of the CL 
language to be used</li> </ul> 
<p>could be simply</p> 
<ul> 
<li>tell the parsing module whether the CL language will be a WinCL or a NixCL 
language</li> </ul> 
<p>An alternative is to use a parser utility that is designed to handle 
specifically WinCL or NixCL. Python&rsquo;soptparse, for example, 
&ldquo;supports only the most common command-line syntax and semantics 
conventionally used under Unix.&rdquo; And if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with 
those conventions,the documentation summarizes them.</p> Comments (4) <br>

<h3> Unicode for dummies &ndash; just&nbsp;use&nbsp;UTF-8 </h3>  Filed under: 
Unicode &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 3:29 pm <br>

<p>Commenting on my previous post about Unicode, an anonymous commentator 
noted that</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>the usage of the BOM <em>[the Unicode Byte Order Mark]</em> with UTF-8 is 
strongly discouraged and really only a Microsoft-ism. It&rsquo;s not used on 
Linux or Macs and just tends to get in the way of things.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So it seems worth-while to talk a bit more about the BOM.&nbsp; And in the 
spirit of&nbsp;Beginners Introduction for Dummies Made Simple,&nbsp;let&rsquo;s 
begin at the beginning: by&nbsp;distinguishing big and little from left and 
right.</p> 
<h2>Big and Little</h2> 
<p>&ldquo;Big&rdquo; in this context means &ldquo;more significant&rdquo;. 
&ldquo;Little&rdquo; means &ldquo;least significant&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Consider the year of American independence&nbsp;&mdash; 1776.&nbsp; In the 
number 1776:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The least significant (&ldquo;smallest&rdquo;) digit&nbsp;is 6. It has the 
smallest magnitude: it represents 6 * 1, or 6.</li> 
<li>The most significant (&ldquo;biggest&rdquo;) digit is 1. It has the 
largest magnitude: it represents 1 * 1000, or 1000.</li> </ul> 
<p>So we say that 1 is located at the <em>big end</em> of 1776 and 6 is 
located at the<em> small end</em> of 1776.</p> 
<h2>Left and Right</h2> 
<p>Here are two technical terms: &ldquo;big endian&rdquo; and &ldquo;little 
endian&rdquo;.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>These terms are derived from &ldquo;Big End In&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little End 
In.&rdquo;&nbsp; According toWikipedia, the terms Little-Endian and Big-Endian 
were introduced in 1980 by Danny Cohen in a paper called&ldquo;On Holy Wars and 
a Plea for Peace&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>1776 is a &ldquo;big endian&rdquo; number because the &ldquo;biggest&rdquo; 
(most significant) digit is stored in the leftmost position. The big end of 
1776 is on the left.</p> 
<p>Big-endian numbers are familiar.&nbsp; Our everyday &ldquo;arabic&rdquo; 
numerals are&nbsp;big-endian representations of numbers.&nbsp; If we used a 
little-endian representation, the number 1776 would be represented 
as&nbsp;6771.&nbsp; That is, with the &ldquo;little&rdquo; end of 
1776&nbsp;&mdash; the &ldquo;smallest&rdquo; (least significant) 
digit&nbsp;&mdash; in the leftmost position.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>What do you think?&nbsp;In Roman numerals, 1776 is represented as 
MDCCLVI. Are Roman numerals big-endian or little-endian?</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>So big and little are not the same as left and right.</p> 
<h2>Byte Order</h2> 
<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to talk about <em>byte order</em>. And specifically, 
byte-order in computer architectures.</p> 
<p>Most computer (hardware) architectures agree on bits (ON and OFF) and bytes 
(a sequence of 8 bits), and byte-level endian-ness. &nbsp;(Bytes are 
big-endian: the leftmost bit of&nbsp;a byte is the biggest.&nbsp; See
Understanding Big and Little Endian Byte Order.)</p> 
<p>But problems come up when handling&nbsp;pieces of data, like large numbers 
and strings, that are stored in multiple bytes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different computer 
architectures use different endian-ness at the level of&nbsp;multi-byte data 
items (I&rsquo;ll call them<em>chunks</em> of data).</p> 
<p>In the memory of little-endian computers, the &ldquo;little&rdquo; end of a 
data chunk is stored leftmost. This means that, a data chunk whose logical 
value is&nbsp;0&times;12345678 is&nbsp;stored as 4 bytes with the least 
significant byte to the left, like this: 0&times;78 0&times;56 0&times;34 
0&times;12.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>For those (like me) who are still operating largely at the dummies level: 
imagine 1776 being stored in memory as 6771.</li> </ul> 
<p>Big-endian hardward does the reverse. In the memory of big-endian 
computers, the &ldquo;big&rdquo; end of a data chunk is stored leftmost. This 
means that a data chunk of&nbsp;0&times;12345678 is stored as 4 bytes with the 
most significant byte to the left, like this: 0&times;12 0&times;34 0&times;56 
0&times;78.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>For us dummies: imagine 1776 being stored in memory as 1776.</li> </ul> 
<p>Here are some random (but curiously interesting) bits of information, 
courtesy of the Microsoft Support web-site articleExplanation of Big Endian and 
Little Endian Architecture.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Intel computers are little endian.</li> 
<li>Motorola computers are big endian.</li> 
<li>RISC-based MIPS computers and the DEC Alpha computers are configurable for 
big endian or little endian.</li> 
<li>Windows NT was designed around a little endian architecture, and runs 
only&nbsp;on little-endian computers or computers running in little-endian mode.
</li> </ul> 
<p>In summary, the byte order&nbsp;&mdash; the order of the bytes in 
multi-byte chunks of data &mdash; is different on big-endian and little-endian 
computers.</p> 
<p>Which brings us to&hellip;</p> 
<h2>The Unicode Byte Order Mark</h2> 
<p>In this section, I&rsquo;m going shamelessly to rip off information from 
Jukka K. Korpela&rsquo;s outstandingUnicode Explained from O&rsquo;Reilly (see 
the section on<em>Byte Order</em> starting on page 300). (See also 
Jukka&rsquo;s valuableweb page on characters and encodings.)</p> 
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re running a big-endian computer, and create a file in 
Unicode&rsquo;s UTF-16 (two-byte) format.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>Note that the encoding is the Unicode UTF-16 (two-byte) encoding, not 
UTF-8 (one-byte).</em><em>That&rsquo;s an important aspect of the problem, as 
you will see.</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>You send the file out into the world, and it is downloaded by somebody 
running a little-endian computer. The recipient knows that the file is in 
UTF-16 encoding. But the bytes are not in the order that he (with his 
little-endian computer) expects. The&nbsp;data in the file appears to 
be&nbsp;scrambled beyond recognition.</p> 
<p>The solution, of course, is simply to tell the recipient that the file was 
encoded in UTF-16<em>on a big-endian computer</em>.&nbsp; Ideally, we&rsquo;d 
like for the data in the file itself to be able to tell the recipient&nbsp;the 
byte order (big endian or small endian) that was used when the data was encoded 
and stored in the file.</p> 
<p>This is exactly what the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) is designed to do.
</p> 
<p>Unicode contains two code points reserved specifically for the purpose of 
indicating byte order: U+FEFF (big endian) and U+FFFE (little endian).</p> 
<p>These code points are used for nothing else than to indicate byte order. If 
the first two bytes of a file are 0xFEFF or 0xFFFE, then a Unicode decoder 
knows that those two bytes contain a Unicode BOM, and knows what to do with the 
BOM.</p> 
<p>This also means that if you (in the role, say, of a forensic computer 
scientist) must process a mystery file, and you see that the file&rsquo;s first 
two bytes contain one of the two Unicode BOMs, you can (with a high probability 
of being correct) infer that the file is encoded in Unicode UTF-16 format.</p> 
<h2>So: Where&rsquo;s the BOM?</h2> 
<p>In actual practice,&nbsp;most UTF-8 files do <em>not</em> include a 
BOM.&nbsp; Why not?</p> 
<p>A file that has been encoded using UTF-16 is an ordered sequence of 2-byte 
chunks. Knowing the order of the bytes within the chunks is crucial to being 
able to decode the file into the correct Unicode code points.&nbsp; So a BOM 
should be considered mandatory<em>for files encoded using UTF-16</em>.</p> 
<p>But a file in UTF-8 encoding is an ordered sequence of 1-byte chunks.&nbsp; 
In&nbsp;UTF-8, a byte and a chunk are essentially the same thing.&nbsp; So with 
UTF-8, the problem of knowing the order of the bytes within the chunks is 
simply a non-issue, and&nbsp;a BOM is pointless. And since the Unicode standard 
does not require the use of the BOM, virtually nobody puts a BOM<em>in files 
encoded using UTF-8.</em></p> 
<h2>Let&rsquo;s do UTF-8&hellip; all the time!</h2> 
<p>It is important to recognize that UTF-8 is able to represent any character 
in the Unicode standard. &nbsp;So there is a simple rule for coding English 
text (i.e. text that uses only or mostly ASCII characters)&nbsp;&mdash;</p> 
<p><strong>Always use UTF-8. </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>UTF-8&nbsp;is easy to use. You don&rsquo;t need a BOM.</li> 
<li>UTF-8&nbsp;can encode anything.</li> 
<li>For English or mostly-ASCII text, there is essentially no storage penalty 
for using UTF-8. (Note, however, that if you&rsquo;re encoding Chinese text, 
your mileage will differ!)</li> </ul> 
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like!!??</p> 
<h2>UTF-8? For every Unicode code point?!</h2> 
<p>How can you possbily encode <em>every </em>character in the entire Unicode 
character set using only 8 bits!!!!</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s where Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s (Joel on Software) excellent post 
The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know 
About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!) comes in useful.&nbsp; As Joel 
notes</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Some people are under the misconception that Unicode is simply a 16-bit 
code where each character takes 16 bits and therefore there are 65,536 possible 
characters. This is not, actually, correct. It is the single most common myth 
about Unicode, so if you thought that, don&rsquo;t feel bad.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is the myth that Unicode is what is known as a Multibyte Character Set 
(MBCS) or Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS).&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully, by now, this 
myth is dying.</p> 
<p>In fact, UTF-8 is what is known variously as a</p> 
<ul> 
<li>multibyte encoding</li> 
<li>variable-width encoding</li> 
<li>multi-octet encoding (For us dummies, <em>octet</em> == <em>byte</em>. For 
the difference, see page 46 of Korpela&rsquo;sUnicode Explained.)</li> </ul> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s how multibyte encoding works in UTF-8.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>ASCII characters are stored in single bytes.</li> 
<li>Non-ASCII characters are stored in multiple bytes, in a &ldquo;multibyte 
sequence&rdquo;.</li> 
<li>For non-ASCII characters, the first byte in a multibyte sequence is always 
in the range 0xC0 to 0xFD. The coding of the first byte indicates how many 
bytes follow, and so indicates the total number of bytes in the multibyte 
sequence.</li> 
<li>In UTF-8, a multibyte sequence can contain as many as four bytes.</li> 
<li>Originally a multibyte sequence could contain&nbsp;six bytes, but UTF-8 was
restricted to four bytes by RFC 3629 in November 2003.</li> </ul> 
<p>For a quick overview of how this works at the bit level, take a look at the 
answer by<strong>dsimard</strong> to the question How does UTF-8 
&ldquo;variable-width encoding&rdquo; work? on stackoverflow.</p> 
<h2>Wrapping it all up</h2> 
<p>So that&rsquo;s it. Our investigation of the BOM has led us to take a 
closer look at UTF-8 and multibyte encoding.</p> 
<p>And that leads us to a nice place. For the most part, and certainly if 
you&rsquo;re working with ASCII data, there is a simple rule.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>Just use UTF-8 and forget about the BOM.</em></p> </blockquote>

<h3> Unicode Beginners Introduction for Dummies&nbsp;Made&nbsp;Simple </h3>  
Filed under:Unicode &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 1:00 am <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to grok Unicode, and it hasn&rsquo;t been 
easy.&nbsp; But today, I finally got it.&nbsp; And, as it turns out, the basics 
of Unicode aren&rsquo;t too difficult.</p> 
<p>The problems that I&rsquo;ve been having turn out not to be with Unicode, 
but with the introductions that I&rsquo;ve found.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re pretty 
confusing.&nbsp; Or maybe I should say, they just don&rsquo;t fit my 
brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the logical thing to do, of course, is to write the 
introduction that I would like to have read.</p> 
<p>A lot of what I will write will be shamelessly ripped off from other 
descriptions that I&rsquo;ve found useful, including</p> 
<ul> 
<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode</li> 
<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set</li> 
<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8</li> 
<li>Michael Foord&rsquo;s article on character encodings for the October 18, 
2005 issue of Pyzine was both confusing and very helpful</li> </ul> 
<p>We start with the observation that &ldquo;Unicode&rdquo; is actually two 
separate and distinct things.&nbsp; And the first of these things has nothing 
to do with computers.</p> 
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re an English orientalist in, say, 
1750.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve just discovered Sumerian cuneiform characters 
from the middle east and&nbsp;Sanskit characters from India.&nbsp; You get a 
brilliant idea.&nbsp; You will make a list of all characters in all languages 
ever used.&nbsp; Each will be identified by its own unique number.&nbsp; So you 
start out making your list with your own good English characters.&nbsp; You add 
in thecuneiform characters and the Sanskrit characters and Greek, Japanese, 
Chinese, and Korean characters. You add in characters for the funny 
squiggly/accented/umlauted characters in Spanish, French and German. And so 
on.&nbsp;And finally you have a very long list of about a zillion characters.
</p> 
<pre>1 a 2 b 3 c ... 26 z 27 A 28 B ... 52 Z 53 (space) 54 ? (question mark) 
55 , (comma) ... and so on ...</pre> 
<p>And (as I say) you did it all with your feather-quill pen. This has nothing 
to do with computers. It is simply about creating a numbered list of all known 
characters.</p> 
<p>When you finish, you have a complete (you hope) set of characters. So you 
call it a &ldquo;character set&rdquo;. And because you&rsquo;re in a funny 
mood, instead of calling the numeric identifiers&nbsp;&rdquo;numeric 
identifiers&rdquo;, you call them &ldquo;code points&rdquo;. And because your 
list is meant to include every character in the known universe, you call it the 
Universal Character Set, or UCS.</p> 
<p>Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve just invented the first, non-computer, half 
of Unicode, theUniversal Character Set.</p> 
<p>Now you borrow Guido&rsquo;s time machine and fast-forward 260 years to 
2010.&nbsp; Everybody is using computers.&nbsp; So you have a brilliant 
idea.&nbsp; You will find a way for computers to handle your UCS.</p> 
<p>Now computers think in 8-bit bytes.&nbsp; So you think:&nbsp; we&rsquo;ll 
use one byte for each numeric identifier (code point)!&nbsp; Great idea!&nbsp; 
An 8-bit encoding.</p> 
<p>The problem of course is that with 8 bits you can make only 256 different 
bit combinations.&nbsp; And your list has way more than 256 characters.&nbsp; 
So you think: we&rsquo;ll use two bytes for each character!&nbsp; Great 
idea!&nbsp; A 16-bit encoding.</p> 
<p>But there are still problems.&nbsp; First, even two bytes are not enough to 
store a number as big as a zillion.&nbsp; You figure that you&rsquo;ll need at 
least 3 bytes to hold the biggest number on your list.&nbsp; Second, even if 
you decided&nbsp;to use<strong>four</strong> bytes (32 bits) for each 
character, your list might still keep growing and someday even 32-bits might 
not be enough.&nbsp; Third, you&rsquo;re doing mostly English, and 8 bits is 
plenty for working with English.&nbsp; So with a 16-bit encoding, you&rsquo;re 
using twice as much storage as you really need (and, if you use a 32-bit 
encoding, you&rsquo;re using four times as&nbsp;much as you need).</p> 
<p>So you think:&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s just use an 8-bit encoding, but with a 
twist.&nbsp; One of the bit combinations won&rsquo;t identify a character at 
all, but will be sort of a continuation sign, saying (in essence) this 
character identifier is continued on the next several bytes.&nbsp; So for the 
most part, you&rsquo;ll use only one byte per character, but if you need a 
document to contain some exotic charcters, you can do that.</p> 
<p>Congratulations!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve just invented UTF-8 &mdash; the 8-bit 
Unicode Transformation Format, a variable length encoding in which every UCS 
character (code point) can be encoded in 1 to 4 bytes.</p> 
<p>Now you still have one last problem.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve defined both a 
UTF-8 format and a UTF-16 format.&nbsp; So you go to open a file and start 
reading.&nbsp; You read the first two bytes.&nbsp; How do you know what 
you&rsquo;re reading?&nbsp; Are the first two bytes two characters in UTF-8 
encoding? or&nbsp;a single character in UTF-16 encoding?&nbsp; What you need is 
a standard marker at the beginning of files to indicate what encoding the file 
is in.</p> 
<p>Bingo.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve just invented the Byte Order Mark, or BOM (aka 
&ldquo;encoding signature&rdquo;).&nbsp; The BOM is a two-byte marker at the 
beginning of a file that tells what encoding the file is using.</p> 
<p>So now, when you read a file, you first read the BOM, which tells you what 
encoding was used to create the file.&nbsp; This allows you to decode the file 
into code points (however code points are represented internally in your 
programming language: Java, Python, whatever).&nbsp; And when you write out a 
file, you choose the encoding to be used to encode your Unicode charaters in 
bits.&nbsp; You write the BOM, and you write out your Unicode strings.&nbsp; 
When you write out the Unicode strings, you specify the encoding to be used 
when writing the bits and bytes to the file.</p> 
<p>And that&rsquo;s the basics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary,</p> 
<pre>Unicode = UCS (definition of a universal character set) + UTF (techniques 
for encoding code points in bit-configurations)</pre> 
<p>The connection between characters and bit configurations is the numeric 
character identifier, the &ldquo;code point&rdquo;.</p> 
<pre><code> Character set |------------------------| Encoding 
|-------------------------------------| CHARACTER CODE POINT BIT CONFIGURATION 
======= ========== ============= a 1 0000 b 2 0001 and so on.</code></pre> 
<p>There are lots more complicated details of course. But this is the basics.

<h3> Multiple constructors in a Python&nbsp;class </h3>  Filed under: Python 
features &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 3:45 pm <br>

<p>In addition to working with Python, I also work with Java quite a lot.</p>

<h3> Thinking in Restructured&nbsp;Text </h3>  Filed under: Miscellaneous 
&mdash; Steve Ferg @ 9:43 pm<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn reST and finding it hard going.&nbsp; reST 
just doesn&rsquo;t seem to work the way I expect it to work.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the problem lies in reST or in me. It could be 
me.&nbsp; I carry a lot of conceptual baggage &mdash; it may just be that reST 
is different from structured-text dialects that I&rsquo;ve worked with in the 
past.</p> 
<p>Anyway, at this point I am a reST newbie.&nbsp; As such, I want to find:</p>
<ul> 
<li>A few very short, very accessible introductions or tutorials to reST</li> 
<li>an explanation of reST&rsquo;s basic &ldquo;world-view&rdquo;</li> 
<li>an online sandbox where I can play with reST, similar to the markdown 
dingus</li> </ul> 
<h1>1. Introductions</h1> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve found these to be pretty useful.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Sphinx reST introduction.</li> 
<li>a great introductory tutorial </li> 
<li>another very good short tutorial</li> 
<li>a short video at showmedo.com that gives a quick overview of the things 
you can do with reST</li> 
<li>and of course the official reST Web page has several good items in its 
documentation section</li> </ul> 
<h1>2. Fundamental concepts</h1> 
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet found a good explanation of reST&rsquo;s 
world-view.&nbsp; I suspect it is staring me in the face and I&rsquo;m just not 
seeing it.&nbsp; What I need is for it to be spelled out in big block 
letters.&nbsp; And then to be hit over the head with it. Sort of like this:</p> 
<p><strong><em>reST is built on three fundamental concepts: paragraph, 
indentation, and whitespace.</em></strong></p> 
<h2>paragraph</h2> 
<p>The paragraph is the basic building block of reST. A paragraph is a chunk 
of text separated from other chunks by one or more blank lines.</p> 
<p>reST ignores single newlines, but two or more adjacent newlines (i.e. one 
or more blank lines) delimit a paragraph.</p> 
<h2>indentation</h2> 
<p>Paragraphs must have the same indentation &mdash; that is, line up at their 
left edge. Paragraphs that start indented will result in indented quote 
paragraphs. For example:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>This is a paragraph. It's quite short. This paragraph will result in an 
indented block of text, typically used for quoting other text. This is another 
one.</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>Results in:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This is a paragraph. It&rsquo;s quite short.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This paragraph will result in an indented block of text, typically used for 
quoting other text.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This is another one.</p> </blockquote> 
<h2>whitespace</h2> 
<p>The importance of white space is touched on in a tip in the official reST 
introduction, which talks about inline markup &ndash; markup for things like 
italics, bold, monospaced text, etc.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Think of inline markup as a form of (parentheses) and use it the same way: 
immediately before and after the text being marked up. Inline markup by itself 
(surrounded by whitespace) or in the middle of a word won&rsquo;t be recognized.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>reST markup is context-sensitive, or maybe I should say whitespace 
sensitive. For example, an asterisk in one context creates a bullet for a 
bullet-list. An asterisk in another context creates inline markup for emphasis 
(italics).<em>The difference in the context is whether or not the asterisk is 
or is not preceded or followed by whitespace.</em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>An asterisk that is preceded by, but not followed by, whitespace starts 
italics.</li> 
<li>An asterisk that is followed by, but not preceded by, whitespace ends 
italics.</li> 
<li>Otherwise, an asterisk at the beginning of a line creates a bullet.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This creates emphasis.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>some text. *enclosed text* some text.</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>But this creates a bullet item.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>some text. * enclosed text * some text.</pre> </blockquote> 
<h1>3. A reST dingus</h1> 
<p>I have been able to find an online reST editor.&nbsp; 
http://cometdemo.lshift.net:8080/greed/welcome_document/ I&rsquo;m not quite 
sure what to call it, so I&rsquo;ll call it &ldquo;greed&rdquo; &mdash; 
that&rsquo;s a nice memorable name.&nbsp; In my experience, greed&rsquo;s page 
layout doesn&rsquo;t work very well under Firefox, but works just fine with 
Internet Explorer.</p> 
<p>There is also a pretty nice reST dingus at Siafoo, at 
www.siafoo.net/tools/reST.</p> 
<h1>4. Things that I find confusing</h1> 
<p>I get confused when I read this in the reST documentation:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A paragraph is a chunk of text separated from other chunks by one or more 
blank lines. &hellip; Paragraphs must have the same indentation &mdash; that 
is, line up at their left edge.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Is it saying that the definition of a paragraph is: a chunk of lines that 
is separated from other chunks of lines by two newlines<em>and </em>contains 
lines all of which have the same indentation?&nbsp; What happens if you have a 
chunk of lines that is delimited by double newlines, but contains lines with<em>
different</em>indentation levels?</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s start with these lines.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>line A line B line C</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>If we feed these lines to greed, we get:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>line A line B line C</p> </blockquote> 
<p>No surprises there.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s add some indentation to line B:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>line A line B line C</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>When we feed this to greed, what we get is roughly (I say 
&ldquo;roughly&rdquo; because in WordPress it is difficult to reproduce the 
exact HTML that you get from greed) this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>line A line B <strong>System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;string&gt;, line 3) 
Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</strong> line C
</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>So reST has rejected a paragraph with irregular indentation.</p> 
<p>This is A Good Thing.&nbsp; reST seems to be acting they way I would expect 
it to.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s try putting double newlines after line B, like this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>line A line B line C</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>When we feed this to greed, it produces roughly this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>line A line B line C</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>So now I&rsquo;m confused. In theory, line A and line B form a single, 
double-newline-delimited paragraph, with<em>irregular </em>indentation.&nbsp; 
reST rejected irregular indentation in a paragraph in the previous example, but 
now reST is accepting irregular indentation and acting as if line B was an 
indented paragraph. What is going on???!!! (See the answer, below.)</p> 
<p>So what happens if we put a double newline after line A?&nbsp; We get 
roughly this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<pre>line A line B line C</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>This is the same result as before, but with more space between line A and 
line B.&nbsp; This is what I would have expected.</p> 
<h1>So what <em>was </em>going on?</h1> 
<p>My hypothesis is that reST interpreted line A and line B as a definition 
list &mdash; line A being the <em>term</em>, line B being the <em>definition
</em>.</p> 
<p>The reST docs say that in a definition list, &ldquo;Blank lines are not 
allowed between term and definition.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So (to put it in the most obtuse way possible) a paragraph is a chunk of 
lines that is separated from other chunks of lines by two newlines. All of the 
lines in the paragraph must have the same indentation,<em>except when the 
paragraph is a definition list</em>, in which case the indentation of the 
definition<em>must be different</em> (greater than) the indentation of the term.
</p> 
<h1>The Bottom Line</h1> 
<p>I suspect that reST by its very nature has a lot of gotchas.</p> 
<p>reST is trying to do so much (e.g. to support advanced markup structures 
such as definition lists) with so little (simple ASCII text) that it must read 
a lot into what (in other circumstances) would be meaningless 
differences.&nbsp;&nbsp; You might say that reST by its very nature has a very 
high<em>interpretation-to-signal ratio</em>.</p> 
<p>If you are feeling uncharitable, you could say that reST is fragile or 
flaky; if charitable, you might say that it is very sensitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; What 
that adds up to &mdash; for at least some newbies &mdash; is that it has a lot 
of gotchas.</p> 
<p>So (I&rsquo;m embarrassed to admit it) I&rsquo;m still struggling with 
reST.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, it is just a matter of time and experience.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if I work with reST long enough &mdash; and read<em>
all</em>of the documentation &mdash; I will eventually grok it.</p> Comments (3)

<h3> How do I reverse a string in&nbsp;Python&nbsp;3? </h3>  Filed under: 
Moving to Python 3 &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 1:20 pm <br>

<p>With the improved support for Unicode in Python3, more and more folks will 
be working with languages (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) that read right-to-left rather 
than left-to-right. So more and more folks will have a need to reverse a string.
</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Python doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in function, nor do string 
objects have a built-in method, to do what they will want.&nbsp; The obvious 
techniques don&rsquo;t work. This:</p> 
<pre> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(1) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = &quot;a 
b c&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s 
= reverse(s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
print(s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except Exception as e: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(e) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = &quot;a 
b c&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s 
= reversed(s) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(s) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except Exception as e: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(e) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try:

s.reverse() &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
print(s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except Exception as e:

</pre> 
<p>produces this output</p>

3 'str' object has no attribute 'reverse' 4 'str' object has no attribute 
'reversed'</pre> 
<p>Fortunately, the solution is not too difficult. A little one-line function 
will do the trick.</p> 
<p>I call the function &ldquo;rev&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; on 
the chance that Python will eventually acquire its own builtin function named

<h3> What&rsquo;s wrong with use&nbsp;cases? </h3>  Filed under: Software 
Development &mdash; Steve Ferg @ 5:06 pm <br>
Tags: Requirements <br>

<p><em>I originally wrote this in 2002, when Use Cases seemed to be all the 
rage. I thought I would republish it here because the Use Case Approach &mdash; 
although now operating under a variety of new names &mdash; still seems to be 
popular. &mdash; Steve Ferg</em></p> 
<h1>What&rsquo;s wrong with Use Cases?</h1> 
<p>For comparison, let&rsquo;s start with a slightly different question.</p> 
<p><em>What&rsquo;s wrong with chocolate?</em></p> 
<p>At one level, of course, nothing at all is wrong with chocolate. There 
aren&rsquo;t many essential nutrients in chocolate, of course, but in and of 
itself that is not a problem. Consumed in moderation, as part of a well-rounded 
diet, chocolate adds variety and pleasure to the diet, and in some cases may 
provided needed calories.</p> 
<p>But of course, that isn&rsquo;t the end of the story. What&rsquo;s wrong 
with chocolate is that it is delicious. Addictive, in fact! There was a reason 
for the invention of the word<em>chocoholic.</em> Where moderate consumption 
might be useful, chocolate tempts us to immoderate consumption. Where we should 
consume a variety of foods to obtain a balanced intake of nutrients, chocolate 
tempts us to ignore other foods and eat only chocolate. If we succumb to its 
charms, we eat an unbalanced diet. If we eat an unbalance diet, we suffer. The 
consequences of excessive chocolate consumption are very real and easy to see 
(on the bathroom scale, for instance). But (and here is part of the problem) 
the causal connection between chocolate consumption and its consequences is (in 
contrast to chocolate&rsquo;s easily-perceived immediate charms) virtually 
invisible.</p> 
<p>The problem with chocolate, then, lies in a combination of things: it does 
not provide a complete, balanced nutritional intake; it is extremely 
attractive, tempting one to consume only chocolate and ignore other foods; and 
it is very difficult to make the connection between excessive chocolate 
consumption and its undesirable consequences.</p> 
<p>Use Cases have the same problems, caused by the same combination of 
characteristics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A set of Use Cases does not provide a system developer with all of the 
information that he needs about his client&rsquo;s needs, in order to produce a 
system that meets those needs. Use Cases are<em>nutritionally deficient.</em>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Use Cases are extremely attractive. Much of the attraction is probably due 
to their simplicity. One doesn&rsquo;t have to work very hard to understand the 
basic Use Case concepts. With such a low-effort, no-sweat 
requirements-gathering technique available, it is tempting indeed to believe 
that<em>all</em> one has to do when gathering requirements is to create a list 
of Use Cases.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>The use of Use Cases, to the complete or virtual exclusion of other 
requirements-gathering techniques, has undesirable consequences, in the poor 
quality of the systems developed. But these consequences &mdash; the connection 
between requirements gathering and the eventual quality of the system as built 
&mdash; are largely invisible to both developers and developer management.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In fairness, it should be noted that the Use Case approach is not the 
culprit here. The connection between the quality of the requirements-gathering 
for a system, and the quality of the system that is eventually developed, seems 
to be invisible to most organizations<em>regardless</em> of whatever particular 
requirements-gathering methodology the organization is officially practicing. 
That&rsquo;s part of the reason why we &mdash; as a profession and as an 
industry &mdash; continue to do such a poor job of requirements gathering, and 
continue to have so many system failures.</p> 
<p>In short, the analog of the <em>Chocoholic&rsquo;s Diet</em> (in which the 
unfortunate dieter consumes only, or mostly, chocolate) is what we might call 
the<em>Use Case Approach</em> (UCA) in which the unfortunate software 
development organization uses only, or mainly, Use Cases to gather and document 
client requirements. We have been warned for years, by everyone from the 
government to our own doctors, about the dangers of junk food diets, of which 
the Chocoholic&rsquo;s Diet is an example. Now it is time to issue a warning 
about the dangers of junk requirements-gathering methodologies, of which the 
Use Case Approach is an example.</p> 
<p>The time has come to issue such a warning because the Use Case Approach is 
quickly gaining in popularity in software development shops. In most cases, UCA 
is riding on the coat-tails of UML. There are some UML proponents who advocate 
the requirements-gathering equivalent of a balanced diet: a 
requirements-gathering methodology in which Use Cases figure as only one 
element of a well-rounded diet of requirements-gathering techniques. But for 
every such reasonable guru, there is at least one snake-oil salesman pushing 
Use Cases as The Solution For All Your Requirements Methodology Needs. Some of 
these gentlemen give lip service to the idea of a well-balance diet, but it is 
only lip service. In their methodology books and courses, they pause briefly to 
give a cursory nod to (for instance) describing the problem domain, before 
spending the overwhelming bulk of discussion on Use Cases.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the software development community seems to be eating it up. 
Many organizations see UCA as a silver bullet for their biggest requirements 
gathering problem&hellip; which, incidently, seems often not to be<em>How do 
you gather requirements effectively?</em>, but <em>What do you say when 
somebody asks you what your official requirements gathering methodology is?</em>
It used to be said that no one ever lost their job by buying IBM; today, no one 
ever loses their job by adopting Use Cases and UML.</p> 
<p>This stampede of enthusiasm has produced the software development 
equivalent of a national health crisis. Just as the popularity of the 
&ldquo;Sugar Buster&rsquo;s Diet&rdquo; has forced doctors and dietitians to 
issue warnings about the nutritional deficiencies of such a diet, the 
popularity of the Use Case Approach makes it imperative to point out the 
deficiencies of Use Cases as a requirements-gathering tool. That&rsquo;s the 
purpose of this article.</p> 
<h1>Use Cases Unsupported by Domain Descriptions Are Vague</h1> 
<p>When we embark on a system development project, the system to be developed 
is the putative solution to some problem in the user&rsquo;s environment (the 
&ldquo;application domain&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>Naturally, we would expect the problem-solving method to look something 
like this:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>(1) Study the problem until you are confident that you understand it.</li> 
<li>(2) Describe a proposed solution for the problem. (In our field, the 
description of the proposed solution is a requirements specification document 
for a computer system.)</li> 
<li>(3) Implement the solution. (That is, build the system.)</li> </ul> 
<p>A Use Case &mdash; as a description of an actor&rsquo;s interaction with 
the system-to-be &mdash; is both a description of the system&rsquo;s user 
interface and an indirect description of some function that the system will 
provide. In short, as descriptions of the system-to-be, Use Cases belong in 
step 2 &mdash; describing the proposed solution to the problem. So the 
development of Use Cases has a place in the problem solving process&hellip; but 
that place is not as the<em>first</em> step, and it is not as the <em>only</em> 
step.</p> 
<p>The <em>first</em> activity in the requirements-gathering process must be 
the study and description of the problem-environment, the application domain. 
To put it bluntly, the requirements analyst&rsquo;s first job is to<em>study 
and understand the problem,</em> not to jump right in and start proposing a 
solution. (This is a major theme of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s 1995 book,<em>
System Requirements and Specifications</em> and his new book, <em>Problem Frames
</em>. In <em>System Requirements and Specifications,</em> see especially the 
entry on &ldquo;The Problem Context&rdquo;.)</p> 
<p>One way that the problem domain can be described is by <em>creating a model
</em>. The developer begins by creating a model of the &ldquo;real 
world&rdquo;, i.e. the part of the real world that is relevant to the problem 
at hand, the part of reality with which the system is concerned and which 
furnishes its subject matter.</p> 
<p>We start by modeling the real world (rather than describing the 
functionality that we wish the system-to-be to provide) because the model 
supplies essential components that we need in order to create our descriptions 
of the system functionality. In describing a university library application, 
for example, in the real-world model we would describe books and copies of 
books, describe what counts as being a<em>university member</em> for the 
purposes of using the library, and so on. In creating the domain model we, in a 
sense, construct a dictionary of words. We can then use those words when we 
write our descriptions of the functions and Use Cases that we wish the system 
to support. In the case of the university library, once we have described the 
objects in the model, we can specify any system functions that can be described 
using a vocabulary of &ldquo;books&rdquo;, &ldquo;copies of books&rdquo;, and 
&ldquo;university members&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Note that the scope of the vocabulary that was created in the domain model 
implicitly defines (and defines the limits of) a set of possible system 
functions. [Jackson, 1983, p. 64] We can specify any function that can be 
described using the vocabulary of words that appear in the model/dictionary, 
but we cannot specify a function if its description would require terms that 
are not in the model. For instance, we can describe the process of a member 
borrowing a book and the process of returning it, the process of reserving a 
book and the process of notifying a member when a reserved book becomes 
available for checkout, the process of sending out overdue notices, and so on. 
But we can not describe a Use Case in which a university member presses a 
button that triggers the rocket launch of a weather satellite into orbit. 
&ldquo;Rocket&rdquo;, &ldquo;satellite&rdquo;, and &ldquo;launch&rdquo; were 
not part of the conceptual vocabulary that was created in our domain 
description of the university library.</p> 
<p>Note that the model of reality isn&rsquo;t just something that is <em>nice 
</em>to have in order to support the descriptions of the Use Cases. It is an 
<em>essential foundation</em> for those descriptions. If we produce just the 
Use Cases without first creating the description of the problem domain, then 
the descriptions of the Use Cases are fundamentally flawed by using undefined 
terms. A Use Case description for<em>Member Checks Out a Book</em> will use the 
terms &ldquo;library member&rdquo; and &ldquo;book&rdquo;, but if those terms 
have not been defined earlier (in the model of the application domain), then 
the Use Case specification is necessarily vague (i.e. not clearly defined).</p> 
<p>Consider the term &ldquo;book&rdquo;. In this context, the term 
&ldquo;book&rdquo; is ambiguous between<em>book as a work of art</em>, which 
has no physical location, and<em>book as a physical object</em> (a &ldquo;copy 
of a book&rdquo;) that does. Only after we have disambiguated the word 
&ldquo;book&rdquo;, can we explain, for instance, why the<em>book</em> involved 
in the<em>Member Checks Out Book</em> Use Case is not the same as the <em>book
</em> in the <em>Member Reserves Book</em> Use Case. I often use the university 
library as a teaching example in my data modeling classes, just because of this 
ambiguity with the word &ldquo;book&rdquo;. It exposes the students to the 
issue of ambiguity in domain descriptions, and helps me make the point that one 
of the requirements analyst&rsquo;s most important tasks is the detection and 
removal of such ambiguities.</p> 
<p>Such ambiguities are quite real, and quite common. By now, you would expect 
that we would have recognized that fact, and have learned to deal with it. Yet 
one of the most common causes for major project problems is the failure of 
developers and their clients seriously to consider that ambiguity might exist in
<em>their</em> requirements documents. Clients and developers tend to think 
that their primary job on the project is to describe the 
&ldquo;requirements&rdquo; for the system (that is, to describe what the system 
is supposed to do, the solution to the problem), not to describe the problem or 
the problem domain. Project participants often simply assume that the meanings 
of familiar terms are so clear and so well known to everyone present, that no 
explicit definition is necessary. This assumption is often false, and when it 
is false, the consequence is that significant ambiguities in the system 
specification remain hidden until they emerge and plague the later stages of 
the development project.</p> 
<p>In a case that I heard about recently, a requirements analyst was working 
on a project for a large American railroad corporation. He was having problems 
capturing the requirements because his users did not use the word 
&ldquo;train&rdquo; consistently. To some of them, a &ldquo;train&rdquo; was a 
particular collection of rolling stock (a locomotive and all the cars it 
pulled). To others, a &ldquo;train&rdquo; was just the locomotive. To others, a 
&ldquo;train&rdquo; was a regularly scheduled run, as in &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll 
catch the 6 o&rsquo;clock train to Boston&rdquo;. To others, a 
&ldquo;train&rdquo; was a specific instance of a regularly scheduled run, so 
that the train that left for Boston today at 6 o&rsquo;clock, and the train 
that left for Boston yesterday at the same time, are two different trains. And 
so on. In this case, fortunately, the ambiguities were so glaring that they 
could not be ignored. On many projects the ambiguities are not so intrusive, so 
they are left hidden, like ticking time bombs.</p> 
<h1>Use Cases Do Not Capture Important Information about the Problem Context
</h1> 
<p>Another reason that we start development with capturing information about 
the real world is there are properties of the real world that constrain the 
system, or that the system must know about, or that the system relies on, in 
order to satisfy the customer&rsquo;s requirements. Here, the downside of the 
Use-Case approach is that it draws the requirements analyst&rsquo;s attention 
away from the task of describing properties of the real world, and focuses his 
attention on the narrow area where the real world interacts directly with the 
system.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In embedded systems, the system&rsquo;s reliance on properties of the 
surrounding real world are very real, and can often be safety-critical. In<em>
Software Requirements and Specifications</em> (entry 
&ldquo;Requirements&rdquo;) Michael Jackson describes an incident in which an 
airplane overshot the runway when attempting to land. The runway was wet, and 
the plane&rsquo;s wheels were aquaplaning instead of turning. The plane&rsquo;s 
guidance system thought, in effect, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the ground, but my 
wheels aren&rsquo;t turning. So I must not be moving,&rdquo; and would not 
allow the pilot to engage reverse thrust. Aquaplaning, a very relevant property 
of the real world, was not considered by the developers when they created the 
guidance system. The consequence is a plane in a ditch past the end of the 
runway, instead of safely docked in the terminal. (Jackson says that the error, 
which could have been catastrophic, fortunately was not.)</p> 
<p>For computer professionals, it is tempting to blame such problems on the 
clients.<em>Knowing about aquaplaning,</em> we are tempted to say, <em>is our 
client&rsquo;s problem. Our only job is to figure out how to make the system do 
what they tell us they want it to do, in their Use Case descriptions.</em> But 
even if our clients will let us get away with wiggling out of all 
responsibility for planes in ditches (something that seems extremely unlikely), 
this still won&rsquo;t cut it. As Jackson points out in a recent paper, it is 
almost impossible for software developers to build correct software if they 
don&rsquo;t understand the problem domain, and how what they are doing relates 
to what happens there.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>One potentially attractive view, is that the concerns of computer science 
are bounded by the interface between the computer and the world outside 
it&hellip;. So if we restrict our concerns to the behaviour of the computer 
itself we can set aside the disagreeably complex and informal nature of the 
problem world. It is somebody else&rsquo;s task to grapple with that. &hellip;
</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, &hellip; the specification of computer behaviour at the 
interface,<em>taken in isolation,</em> is likely to be a description of 
arbitrary and therefore unintelligible behaviour. &hellip; Practising 
programmers who try to adhere to this doctrine will find themselves devoting 
their skills to tasks that seem at best arbitrary and at worst senseless. 
[Italics mine -- Steve Ferg]</p> 
<p>&ndash; Michael Jackson, &ldquo;The Real World&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Rephrasing this point in terms of Use Cases: it is almost impossible for 
programmers to build correct software if they are given Use Case information 
but no information about the problem domain and how their program relates to 
what happens there. Yet this is what the Use Case Approach encourages 
requirements analysts to do. This is the real problem with the Use Case 
Approach. It discourages the requirements analyst from examining the problem 
domain, by focusing attention only on what happens at the system boundary.</p> 
<h1>For Some Jobs, Use Cases Are Just the Wrong Tool</h1> 
<p>For some applications, there clearly is domain information that must be 
specified in the system requirements, but which has no natural home in any 
particular Use Case. Often, for example, an important requirement for a system 
is that it enforce (or at least not violate) a set of business rules or 
governmental regulations. Other systems (e.g. systems in the physical and 
social sciences) are heavily algorithm-driven. The Use Case Approach provides 
no natural mechanism for capturing such mathematical algorithms, business 
rules, and government regulations. Certainly, it is very unnatural to embed 
them in the descriptions of specific Use Cases. Specifying a single big module 
that contains all of the customer&rsquo;s business rules and (in UML 
terminology) extends every Use Case, is possible but clumsy and unnatural. Use 
Cases are simply not the best tool for capturing such requirements.</p> 
<h1>Nobody Really Knows What a Use Case Description Looks Like</h1> 
<p>Nobody really knows what a Use Case description looks like. Use Cases can 
be written at a very high level of detail, or at a very low level, or anywhere 
in between.</p> 
<p>In some organizations, Use Cases may be written at a very high level. Use 
Case descriptions that are written at too-high a level are often useless. 
Sometimes, they are worse than useless, because they give the impression that 
the system requirements have been completely specified, when in fact that is 
not true at all. A recent case in point was a project to develop a securities 
information system. The customers knew that they wanted the system to generate 
reports, so the system specification included a Use Case to<em>Run Reports</em>
. The problems with this Use Case didn&rsquo;t emerge until the requirements 
analyst began to ask the customers about the contents of the reports that they 
wanted to generate. Then it emerged that the customer had in mind 140 reports 
of radically varying content, and the real requirement for the system &mdash; 
what the customer<em>really</em> needed &mdash; was a system that could store a 
history of all of the kinds of events that could affect securities. Virtually 
all of the system complexity, and all the information needed to design the 
system, was hidden under the single Use Case<em>Run Reports</em>.</p> 
<p>In other organizations, Use Cases may be written at a detailed, 
implementation-specific level, describing the mechanics of the graphical user 
interface (GUI), complete with buttons, menus, and drop-down list boxes. Often, 
at a stage in the project when the primary concern should be understanding the
<em>business</em> context and functions that the system must support, the 
client is instead engaging in premature user-interface design.</p> 
<p>In addition, as the editor of <em>www.uidesign.net</em> observed, in many 
organizations the clients or end-users are the ones who write the Use Case 
descriptions. But without any training in user-interface design<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> &hellip; there is little hope that [the end-users] will make a 
good job of it. &hellip; The adoption of Rational Unified Process in its 
complete form is likely to set the development of good User Interface Design 
back by perhaps 20 years.
<p></p> 
<p>&ndash; <em>http://www.uidesign.net/1999/imho/feb_imho.html</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The result, in short, is not only that the user-interface design is being 
done at the wrong time, it is being done by the wrong people.</p> 
<h1>Use Cases Are Unsystematic</h1> 
<p>An important feature of any useful requirements-gathering methodology is 
that it provides a<em>systematic</em> approach to identifying all of the system 
requirements. A requirements-gathering methodology that consists of writing Use 
Cases is no methodology at all, because it provides no help in systematically 
addressing the problem. The only guidance that the Use Case approach provides 
is the most generic question possible: &ldquo;What would you like to do with 
the system, and how would you like it to behave?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As Ben Kovitz points out, writing software requirements by writing Use 
Cases as they come to mind, is the requirements-writing equivalent of 
programming by hacking around. What it produces is simply a sprawl of Use Cases.
<em>How can you tell if you&rsquo;ve identified all of the Use Cases for the 
system? How can you tell if the Use Cases conflict? How can you tell if the Use 
Cases leave any gaps?</em> It is not possible for an ordinary human to 
understand all of the ways that a grab-bag of 50, or 100, or 200 Use Cases are 
inter-related. Suppose the customer wants the system to support some new 
functionality.<em>How can you tell which, if any, Use Cases will be affected by 
the change?</em> There simply are no answers to these questions.</p> 
<p>In short, as a methodology the Use Case Approach is too mushy to provide 
any real guidance in gathering requirements. The Use Case Approach, in fact, is 
not a methodology at all; it is merely a notation. Once an organization has 
settled on the template that it wants to use for describing Use Cases, 
that&rsquo;s it. At that point, the organization has got all the methodology 
help that it is going to get out of the Use Case Approach.</p> 
<h1>Use Cases Are Not Object-Oriented</h1> 
<p>There is really nothing at all that makes the Use Case Approach especially 
&ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo;. Confined to describing behavior at the system 
boundary, a set of Use Cases describes neither objects in the real world nor 
objects inside the computer.</p> 
<p>Because the Use Case Approach is not object-oriented, it is completely 
compatible with non-object oriented methods. As Grady Booch observed</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>[A] very real danger is that your development team will take [its] 
object-oriented scenarios and turn them into a very nonobject-oriented 
implementation. In more than one case, I&rsquo;ve seen a project start with 
scenarios, only to end up with a functional architecture, because they treated 
each scenario independently, creating code for each thread of control 
represented by each scenario.</p> 
<p>&ndash;entry &ldquo;Scenarios&rdquo; in [Booch, 1998]</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There is nothing wrong with not being object-oriented, of course. If a 
technique is useful, it is useful, object-oriented or not. But given the 
popularity of the buzzword &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo;, I think it is 
important to point out that the object-oriented-ness of Use Cases is a myth. 
Use Cases are enjoying their current popularity because the Three Amigos 
bundled them into UML along with other, truly object-oriented, techniques. 
Whatever object-oriented-ness Use Cases have, they have acquired solely by 
rubbing up against true object-oriented methodologies into whose company they 
have fortuitously fallen.</p> 
<h1>The Proper Use of Use Cases</h1> 
<p>The best metaphor for methodology skills is a handyman&rsquo;s toolbox. No 
handyman could be successful if he relied on a single tool (a hammer, say) for 
everything that he did. Hammers don&rsquo;t work well when you&rsquo;re trying 
to drive a screw, nor when you need to cut a plank. You need different tools 
for different jobs.</p> 
<p>A software developer is a software handyman. To do everything that he needs 
to do, a software developer needs a toolbox that contains a variety of tools. 
Use Case description shouldn&rsquo;t be the<em>only</em> tool in the toolbox. 
It should simply be there along with the other tools, so that it is available 
when it is the right tool for the job.</p> 
<p>Most of the problems with Use Cases that we&rsquo;ve discussed, like the 
problems with chocolate, come not from the thing itself, but from its improper 
or excessive use. In spite of all of the problems we&rsquo;ve discussed, Use 
Cases<em>can</em> be useful &mdash; <em>when they are used properly</em>. Most 
importantly, Use Cases can be an effective tool when they are developed in a 
disciplined manner, as part of a methodology that first creates a well-defined 
domain model.</p> 
<p>The domain model provides an infrastructure for the requirements-gathering 
process, so that the development of Use Cases can proceed<em>systematically,
</em> in a way that could never happen without the domain model. The domain 
model describes the objects in the problem domain, including the events in the 
lives of objects. Once the events in the lives of the objects have been 
described, the requirements analyst can approach the task of writing Use Cases 
in a systematic fashion, by writing a Use Case for each of the events. If the 
life of a library book includes events such as being acquired, being borrowed, 
being returned, etc., then the analyst will develop a Use Case for each of 
those events. Each Use Case answers questions derived from specific events: 
&ldquo;How does the system get told that a book has been returned?&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;How does the system know when to generate overdue-notice letters?&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>In actual practice, of course, deriving Use Cases from the domain model is 
rarely as simple and mechanical as we&rsquo;ve just described. But there are 
techniques for dealing with more intricate situations. The whole purpose of 
systems analysis methodologies, in fact, is to provide guidance for situations 
in which the process is not so simple and mechanical. But whether the process 
of developing a particular Use Case is simple or tricky, its foundation must 
always lie in a solid understanding of the problem, and a carefully-constructed 
description of the problem domain.</p> 
<p>In summary, a set of Use Cases is a description of the system to be 
constructed, the thing to be built, the solution to the problem. But, as 
Michael Jackson points out, before you can effectively start building the 
solution to a problem, &ldquo;first you must concentrate your attention on the 
application domain to learn what the problem is about.&rdquo; [Jackson, 1995, 
p. 158]</p>
