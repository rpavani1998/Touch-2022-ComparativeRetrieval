<h1>Data Access &amp; Open Data</h1>  Issues around access to data 
<h2> IASSIST Quarterly (2011: Fall) </h2>  Submitted by StuartM on Tue,

<h3><strong>Sharing data and building information</strong></h3> 
<p>With this issue (volume 35-3, 2011) of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ) we return 
to the regular format of a collection of articles not within the same 
specialist subject area as we have seen in recent special issues of IQ. 
Naturally the three articles presented here are related to the IQ subject area 
in general, as in: assisting research with data, acquiring data from research, 
and making good use of the user community. This last topic could also be 
spelled &ldquo;involvement&rdquo;. The hope is that these articles will carry 
involvement to the IASSIST community, so that the gained knowledge can be 
shared and practised widely.</p> 
<p><br>
&ldquo;Mind the gap&rdquo; is a caveat to passengers on the London 
Underground. The authors of this article are Susan Noble, Celia Russell and 
Richard Wiseman, all affiliated with ESDS-International hosted by Mimas at the 
University of Manchester in the UK. The ESDS, standing for &ldquo;Economic and 
Social Data Service&rdquo;, are extending their reach beyond the UK. In the 
article &ldquo;Mind the Gap: Global Data Sharing&rdquo; they are looking into 
how today&rsquo;s research on the important topics of climate change, economic 
crises, migration and health requires cross-national data sharing. Clearly 
these topics are international (e.g. the weather or air pollution does not stop 
at national borders), but the article discusses how existing barriers prevent 
global data sharing. The paper is based on a presentation in a session on 
&ldquo;Sharing data: High Rewards, Formidable Barriers&rdquo; at the IASSIST 
2009 conference. It is demonstrated how even international data produced by 
intergovernmental organizations like the International Monetary Fund, the 
International Energy Agency, OECD, the United Nations and the World Bank are 
often only available with an expensive subscription, presented in complex 
incomprehensible tables, through special interfaces; such barriers are making 
the international use of the data difficult. Because of missing metadata 
standards it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the dataset and to search 
for and locate the data resources required. The paper highlights the 
development of e-learning materials that can raise awareness and ease access to 
international data. In this case the example is e-learning for the 
&ldquo;United Nations Millennium Development Goals&rdquo;.</p> 
<p><br>
The second paper is also related to the sharing of data with an 
introduction to the international level. &ldquo;The Research-Data-Centre in 
Research-Data-Centre Approach: A First Step Towards Decentralised International 
Data Sharing&rdquo; is written by Stefan Bender and J&ouml;rg Heining from the 
Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Nuremberg, Germany. In order to 
preserve the confidentiality of single entities, access to complete datasets is 
often restricted to monitored on-site analysis. Although off-site access is 
facilitated in other countries, Germany has relied on on-site security. 
However, an opportunity has been presented where Research Data Centre sites are 
placed at Statistical Offices around Germany, and also at a Michigan centre for 
demography. The article contains historical information on approaches and 
developments in other countries and has a special focus on the German solution. 
The project will gain experience in the complex balance between confidentiality 
and analysis, and the differences between national laws.</p> 
<p><br>
The paper by Stuart Macdonald from EDINA in Scotland originated as a 
poster session at the IASSIST 2010 conference. The name of the paper is 
&ldquo;AddressingHistory: a Web2.0 community engagement tool and API&rdquo;. 
The community consists of members within and outside academia, as local history 
groups and genealogists are using the software to enhance and combine data from 
historical Scottish Post Office Directories with large-scale historical maps. 
The background and technical issues are presented in the paper, which also 
looks into issues and perspectives of user generated content. The 
&ldquo;crowdsourcing&rdquo; tool did successfully generate engagement and there 
are plans for further development, such as upload and attachment of photos of 
people, buildings, and landmarks to enrich the collection.</p> 
<p>Articles for the IQ are always very welcome. They can be papers from 
IASSIST conferences or other conferences and workshops, from local 
presentations or papers especially written for the IQ. If you don&rsquo;t have 
anything to offer right now, then please prepare yourself for the next IASSIST 
conference and start planning for participation in a session there. Chairing a 
conference session with the purpose of aggregating and integrating papers for a 
special issue IQ is much appreciated as the information in the form of an IQ 
issue reaches many more people than the session participants and will be 
readily available on the IASSIST website at http://www.iassistdata.org.</p> 
<p>Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and layout:<br>

<p><br>
Authors can also contact me via e-mail: kbr@sam.sdu.dk. Should you be 
interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as guest editor(s) I will 
also be delighted to hear from you.</p>

<h2> 86 helpful tools for the data professional PLUS 45 bonus tools </h2>  
Submitted by jkitlas on Sat, 2011-10-29 16:04  Topic: 
<ul> 
<li>Data-related Advocacy</li> 
<li>Data Access &amp; Open Data</li> 
<li>Tools, Apps, Technology</li> 
<li>Metadata &amp; Standards</li> </ul> 
<p> I have been working on this (mostly) annotated collection of tools and 
articles that I believe would be of help to both the data dabbler and 
professional. If you are a data scientist, data analyst or data dummy, chances 
are there is something in here for you. I included a list of tools, such as 
programming languages and web-based utilities,data mining resources, some 
prominent organizations in the field, repositories where you can play with 
data, events you may want to attend and important articles you should take a 
look at.</p> 
<p>The second segment (BONUS!) of the list includes a number of art and design 
resources the infographic designers might like including color palette 
generators and image searches. There are also some invisible web resources (if 
you're looking for something data-related on Google and not finding it) and 
metadata resources so you can appropriately curate your data. This is in no way 
a complete list so pleasecontact me here with any suggestions! </p>

open source software issued under theGNU General Public License.</li> 
<li>PSPP- PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It is a 
Free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very similar to 
it with a few exceptions. The most important of these exceptions are, that 
there are no &ldquo;time bombs&rdquo;; your copy of PSPP will not 
&ldquo;expire&rdquo; or deliberately stop working in the future. Neither are 
there any artificial limits on the number of cases or variables which you can 
use. There are no additional packages to purchase in order to get 
&ldquo;advanced&rdquo; functions; all functionality that PSPP currently 
supports is in the core package.PSPP can perform descriptive statistics, 
T-tests, linear regression and non-parametric tests. Its backend is designed to 
perform its analyses as fast as possible, regardless of the size of the input 
data. You can use PSPP with its graphical interface or the more traditional 
syntax commands.</li> 
<li>Rapid I- Rapid-I provides software, solutions, and services in the fields 
of predictive analytics, data mining, and text mining. The company concentrates 
on automatic intelligent analyses on a large-scale base, i.e. for large amounts 
of structured data like database systems and unstructured data like texts. The 
open-source data mining specialist Rapid-I enables other companies to use 
leading-edge technologies for data mining and business intelligence. The 
discovery and leverage of unused business intelligence from existing data 
enables better informed decisions and allows for process optimization.The main 
product of Rapid-I, the data analysis solution RapidMiner is the world-leading 
open-source system for knowledge discovery and data mining. It is available as 
a stand-alone application for data analysis and as a data mining engine which 
can be integrated into own products. By now, thousands of applications of 
RapidMiner in more than 30 countries give their users a competitive edge. Among 
the users are well-known companies as Ford, Honda, Nokia, Miele, Philips, IBM, 
HP, Cisco, Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, mobilkom austria, Akzo 
Nobel, Aureus Pharma, PharmaDM, Cyprotex, Celera, Revere, LexisNexis, Mitre and 
many medium-sized businesses benefitting from the open-source business model of 
Rapid-I.</li> 
<li>R Project - R is a language and environment for statistical computing and 
graphics. It is aGNU projectwhich is similar to the S language and environment 
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent 
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a 
different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much 
code written for S runs unaltered under R. R provides a wide variety of 
statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, 
time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical 
techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of 
choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source 
route to participation in that activity.One of R's strengths is the ease with 
which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including 
mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over 
the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains 
full control.R is available as Free Software under the terms of theFree 
Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form. It 
compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems 
(including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.</li> </ol>

researchers, and many other types of information.</li> 
<li>The WWW Virtual Library The WWW Virtual Library (VL) is the oldest 
catalogue of the Web, started by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of HTML and of 
the Web itself, in 1991 at CERN in Geneva. Unlike commercial catalogues, it is 
run by a loose confederation of volunteers, who compile pages of key links for 
particular areas in which they are expert; even though it isn't the biggest 
index of the Web, the VL pages are widely recognised as being amongst the 
highest-quality guides to particular sections of the Web.</li> 
<li>Intute Intute is a free online service that helps you to find web 
resources for your studies and research. With millions of resources available 
on the Internet, it can be difficult to find useful material. We have reviewed 
and evaluated thousands of resources to help you choose key websites in your 
subject. The Virtual Training Suite can also help you develop your Internet 
research skills through tutorials written by lecturers and librarians from 
universities across the UK.</li> 
<li>CompletePlanet - Discover over 70,000+ databases and specially search 
engines There are hundreds of thousands of databases that contain Deep Web 
content. CompletePlanet is the front door to these Deep Web databases on the 
Web and to the thousands of regular search engines &mdash; it is the first step 
in trying to find highly topical information. By tracing through 
CompletePlanet's subject structure or searching Deep Web sites, you can go to 
various topic areas, such as energy or agriculture or food or medicine, and 
find rich content sites not accessible using conventional search engines. 
BrightPlanet initially developed the CompletePlanet compilation to identify and 
tap into many hundreds and thousands of search sources simultaneously to 
automatically deliver high-quality content to its corporate and enterprise 
customers. It then decided to make CompletePlanet available as a public service 
to the Internet search public.</li> 
<li>Infoplease: Encyclopedia, Almanac, Atlas, Biographies, Dictionary, 
Thesaurus. Information Please has been providing authoritative answers to all 
kinds of factual questions since 1938&mdash;first as a popular radio quiz show, 
then starting in 1947 as an annual almanac, and since 1998 on the Internet at
www.infoplease.com. Many things have changed since 1938, but not our dedication 
to providing reliable information, in a way that engages and entertains.</li>

of elements and their related attributes in MODS Version 3.4 with values or 
value sources where applicable. It is an &quot;outline&quot; of the schema. 
Items highlighted in red indicate changes made to MODS in Version 3.4.All 
top-level elements and all attributes are optional, but you must have at least 
one element. Subelements are optional, although in some cases you may not have 
empty containers. Attributes are not in a mandated sequence and not repeatable 
(per XML rules). &quot;Ordered&quot; below means the subelements must occur in 
the order given. Elements are repeatable unless otherwise 
noted.&quot;Authority&quot; attributes are either followed by codes for 
authority lists (e.g., iso639-2b) or &quot;see&quot; references that link to 
documents that contain codes for identifying authority lists.For additional

structured information fromWikipedia and to make this information available on 
the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and 
to link other data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope this will make it 
easier for the amazing amount of information in Wikipedia to be used in new and 
interesting ways, and that it might inspire new mechanisms for navigating, 
linking and improving the encyclopaedia itself.</li> 
<li>Semantic Web - W3C In addition to the classic &ldquo;Web of 
documents&rdquo; W3C is helping to build a technology stack to support a 
&ldquo;Web of data,&rdquo; the sort of data you find in databases. The ultimate 
goal of the Web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to 
develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The 
term &ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo; refers to W3C&rsquo;s vision of the Web of 
linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on 
the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are 
empowered by technologies such as RDF, SPARQL, OWL, and SKOS.</li>

safely back home by now - and are ready to refresh the memories by watching the
conference webcasts and viewing presentations. Webcasts of all three plenaries 
and Thursday and Friday's concurrent sessions in the Small Auditorium are now 
available. We didn't have cameras available during the Wednesday sessions, so 
no videos of these presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are 
already online - a few are still missing either because we didn't have them or 
we are waiting for an updated version. Please send in any missing presentations 
or email me if there are mistakes that should be corrected!</p>

<p><strong>Guest Editor's Notes:</strong></p> 
<p>The 2008 IASSIST Conference, &ldquo;Technology of Data: Collection, 
Communication, Access and Preservation&rdquo; included a session entitled 
&ldquo;Moving Research Data Into and Out of Institutional Repositories&rdquo; 
from which several papers emerged. In &ldquo;Interoperability Between 
Institutional and Data Repositories: a Pilot Project at MIT&rdquo;, Katherine 
McNeill describes a pilot project to enhance study discovery between two 
repository systems housed in the same institution, DSpace and the Institute for 
Quantitative Social Science Dataverse Network, by enabling the harvesting and 
replication of metadata and content across the two systems. In a related 
project across the pond, Libby Bishop scales this discussion in her description 
of crossinstitutional collection sharing between the University of Leeds and 
the UK Data Archive in the Timescapes project. Bishop asserts that coordination 
among multiple agents is likely to be challenging under any circumstances. 
Challenges magnify when the trajectories of different life cycles, for research 
projects and for data sharing, are considered. Robin Rice echoes these 
sentiments in her article on the DISC-UK DataShare Project, a collaboration 
between the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton and the London 
School of Economics. Rice provides visual evidence in a compelling diagram of 
the data sharing continuum based on storage, discovery, and preservation 
conditions of the digital research materials at each level along the scale -- 
from the lowly thumb drive to the officious national archive. We see plainly 
that as one moves up the continuum, more and more human effort and intervention 
is required to craft the discovery, access, analytic and preservation 
environment. In other words, data curators matter.</p> 
<p>Two other papers tackle these challenges by emphasizing the needs of data 
producers. Luis Martinez-Uribe introduces the University of Oxford&rsquo;s 
Scoping Digital Repository Services for Research Data Management project and 
the findings of a requirement gathering exercise. While the study results 
reveal researchers&rsquo; needs and workflows. Martinez-Uribe asserts that the 
study process itself made an impact on the participants. Study participants 
reflected on and, as a result, fine-tuned how they work with data, why they 
create these materials in the first place and were able to articulate reasons 
for managing these resources the way they do. Similarly, Research Data &amp; 
Environmental Sciences Librarian, Gail Steinhart, writes about the development 
of DataStaR, a Data Staging Repository hosted by Cornell University&rsquo;s 
Albert R. Mann Library. The project developed as a &ldquo;managed 
workspace&rdquo; where researchers contribute datasets they are still actively 
using in direct response to questions that have to do with sharing in the 
active research environment, rather than an archival one.</p> 
<p>While the authors in this issue describe projects going on in many 
different places and settings, taken together, these articles address common 
themes. All address the challenge of scaling data exchange between systems and 
then between institutions. This raises the perennial question of standards: by 
what mechanisms will we set them, and how well will we be able to follow them 
and still accommodate local needs? The importance of aligning repository 
services with researcher needs is another common thread. Data managers must 
ask, &ldquo;how will the active researcher benefit from curation 
efforts&rdquo;? The answer may be that benefit is more than finding or 
accessing a particular resource (yep, I have downloaded the whole thing and all 
the bits are there), but instead being able to examine this resource in many 
ways (okay, lets run frequencies, now I want to see it on a map, and 
let&rsquo;s include some other variables). This is a rich reuse experience, 
creating a real digital &ldquo;laboratory.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Finally, each contributor notes the expanding role of data manager. In its 
own way, each project described here moves data managers upstream, 
pre-publication, into the place where research is actively happening. Though 
all of the articles focus on technological choices and architectures to support 
research data curation, it is striking to realize that each of these choices 
emerge from old-fashioned personal, social, and organizational relationships. 
What we can strive for as data and information managers is to work together as 
fellow researchers and to be ever curious about how these partnerships and the 
sharing of information back and forth can be enhanced by thoughtful information 
and technology design. Some call this the digital plumbing, but I like to think 
of it as e-gilding.</p>

<p>In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, the Finnish Social 
Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey targeting professors of 
human sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences in Finnish 
universities. Professors were asked, for example, whether their department had 
any guidelines on the preservation of digital research data. A great and 
alarming majority (90%) said no. The survey also charted what actually happens 
to research data and what are the barriers to and benefits of open access to 
research data.</p>&nbsp; In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, 
the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey 
targeting professors of human sciences, social sciences and behavioural 
sciences in Finnish universities. &nbsp; Professors were asked, for example, 
whether their department had any guidelines on the preservation of digital 
research data. A great and alarming majority (90%) said no. &nbsp; What then 
happens to research data? Most common practise seems to be that the data 
remains in the hand of the original researcher(s). Even if the data are stored 
in the department or research insitute, no further processing nor documentation 
takes place. FSD's influence could be seen in social sciences, making archiving 
at a data archive a bit more frequent than in other sciences. &nbsp; The survey 
also charted&nbsp;barriers&nbsp;to open access. Professors were concerned about 
inadvertent misuse of data and consequent mistakes. Of course, without detailed 
documentation, data reuse may indeed result in inaccurate interpretations. Lack 
of agreements regarding data ownership and IP rights were also mentioned as 
barriers, as well as loss of competitive advantage, IT problems, and 
confidentiality issues. &nbsp; On the other hand, the professors saw many 
benefits in open access to research data. The most significant was enhancing 
the diversity of research designs with the use of archived data. All in all, 
the benefits were estimated to be more significant than the barriers. The 
survey also showed - not surprisingly - that it is usual to a researcher to 
have a positive attitude towards open access in general but a 
less-than-enthusiastic one to open access to his/her own data. &nbsp; The 
report concludes that from the viewpoint of long-term preservation and reuse, 
it is definitely less recommendable to leave the responsibility for the 
preservation and dissemination of data to individual researchers. Changing this 
practice that still prevails in Finnish universities and other Finnish research 
organisations constitutes one of the key goals in the national implementation 
of the OECD Recommendation. &nbsp; An abridged version of the report is 
available in English: Arja Kuula &amp; Sami Borg (2008). Open Access to and 
Reuse of Research Data - The State of the Art in Finland. University of 
Tampere. Finnish Social Science Data Archive; 7. ISBN: 978-951-44-7479-8.
