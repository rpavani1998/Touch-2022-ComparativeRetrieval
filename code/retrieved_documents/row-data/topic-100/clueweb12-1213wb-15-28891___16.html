<h1>Python Training for Cheminformatics</h1> 
<p> I teach training courses in Python programming for computational 
chemistry, with an emphasis on cheminformatics. No public courses are currently 
scheduled. I will be in Ireland for OpenEye's CUP conference in September and 
in England in October. If you are interested in on-site training during those 
trips, let me know!</p> 
<p> To apply or ask questions, send email to trainingdiscard
@dalkescientific.com. Up-to-date information can always be found at

<h2>Why programming courses for chemists?</h2> 
<p> Computational chemists are not programmers, but programming is an 
essential skill for developing new algorithms, generating data, and analyzing 
results. Most working scientists have little training in programming and end up 
spending a lot of time figuring out how to parse a file format or work with a 
software library, rather than figuring out the science.</p> 
<p> My training course is designed for just these people. </p> 
<p> I teach both corporate courses and public ones. The presentations are a 
mixture of lecture and hands-on exercises in a similar style to myNBN courses. 
The specific topics will vary based on the needs of the audience. Contact me if 
there's something you specifically want me to discuss, and see the bottom of 
this page for apartial list of topics I can cover. </p> 
<h2>Who am I?</h2> 
<p> My name is Andrew Dalke. I am a professional software developer with years 
of experience creating tools for cheminformatics, molecular modeling, 
bioinformatics, and related fields. Some the more public projects I've been 
part of are VMD, NAMD, BioPython, PyDaylight, and the Open Bioinformatics 
Foundation. Thoughout my career I have worked closely with chemists to help 
them be more effective, by developing software, providing one-on-one advice, 
training, and writingessays about software side of this field. </p> 
<p> Most of my work over the last 10 years has been in Python, which is the 
most popular high-level language in computational chemistry. Many tools, 
especially in molecular visualization and chemical informatics, have Python 
interfaces. Python is also one of the most popular computer languages in the 
world, with mature software libraries for everything from image manipulation 
and SQL databases to GUI and web development. I am a member of the Python 
Software Foundation, which is the non-profit that holds the copyright to Python.
</p> 
<h1>  Scheduled courses </h1> 
<p> The following courses are meant for computational chemists with some 
programming background. It is not an introduction to programming course. You 
must know how to write programs* and should have some experience with Python. 
</p> 
<p> Course fees include coffe breaks, lunch, and all presentation materials. 
Each day starts at 9.00 and ends around 17.30.</p>

<h2>Web Application Development with Django</h2> 
<h3>Leipzig, Germany, 16-18 February 2011</h3> 
<p> This three day course walks through two real-world examples based on the 
Django web application framework: an interactive descriptor calculator and a 
PubChem database search system. This course is meant for computational chemists 
who want to set up an in-house cheminformatics server for specific analysis 
tasks. The topics I'll cover are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Setting up a Django server,</li> 
<li>Working with a SQL database,</li> 
<li>Structure depictions and entry,</li> 
<li>Fingerprint generation and searching,</li> 
<li>Plotting,</li> 
<li>Introduction to Javascript and JQuery.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Attendees must have some existing Python experience. I will be teaching a 
two day Python course immediately before the Django course. If you attend both 
courses you will get a discount.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Registration for the Django course is &euro;1,300 and is limited to 8 
people.<b>Special discount:</b> attend this course plus the Python course for 
&euro;2,000 instead of &euro;2,200.</p> 
<p> The course will be hosted by and invoices sent by the Python Academy,

trainingdiscard@dalkescientific.com if you have any questions. </p> 
<h2>What experience do you need?</h2> 
<p> My courses are meant for computational chemists who are not programmers 
but have some programming experience. Computational chemists in this case means 
small-molecule chemistry with an emphasis on cheminformatics and a bit of 
molecular modeling. You must already know the basic science, like SMILES, 
molecular graph representation, SMARTS and substructure searches.</p>
<p> The phrase &quot;some programming experience&quot; means people who are 
comfortable with strings, integers, floats, variables, if-statements, 
for-loops, variables, lists/arrays, and defining functions. You must also be 
comfortable working on the command-line and using a text editor or IDE to write 
programs. You do not need to know object oriented programming.</p>
<p> You should have some experience with Python but that is not essential. 
I'll teach the Python-specific features as I work through my examples. Most of 
the code will look similar in other languages so it should be easy to follow.
</p> 
<p> For those just starting off in Python, the Python Beginner's Guide 
contains links to many resources including online tutorials and a list of 
books. You might be interested in thetutor mailing list &quot;for folks who 
want to ask questions regarding how to learn computer programming with the 
Python language.&quot;</p> 
<p> I have taught beginning programming to bioinformatics graduate students. 
You can see mylecture notes under the header &quot;Introduction to Programming 
for Bioinformatics in Python.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Possible topics</h2>  I cover different topics in my courses, depending on 
the length of the course, background of the participants, and what they want me 
to focus on. For each course I list the topics I will cover and I may also 
cover some additional topics depending on the time and class expertise. The 
following are some of the topics I can cover, so you can get an idea of what to 
expect.<b>I will not cover all of these in a single course.</b> Contact me if 
there's something special you to know more about. 
<h3>Overview of Python</h3> 
<p> Some background about Python, how it got to where it is, and where it's 
going. This will be about how Python fits into the world. It is not an 
introduction to programming course.</p> 
<h3>IPython</h3> 
<p> IPython enhances the normal interactive Python interpreter to make it 
better for exploratory programming. New features include easier access to 
normal shell commands, improved history, support for matplotlib, and better 
help. You might find Jeff Rush'sIPython videos helpful. </p> 
<h3>matplotlib</h3> matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces 
publication quality figures for hard-copy and interactive use. I'll work 
through several examples based on chemistry data sets, such as producing a 
scatter plot and exporting the result. Seethe gallery for some examples of what 
it can do. 
<h3>parsing CSV files</h3> 
<p> A lot of chemistry data is passed around as comma-, space-, or tab- 
separated files. I'll work through how to use Python to parse these sorts of 
files, with a focus on SMILES files.</p> 
<h3>OEChem</h3> OEChem is a commercial programming library from OpenEye for 
small molecule chemistry. It's full-featured, fast, and powerful, but a bit on 
the hard side to use. Some of the topics I can cover are:
<ul> 
<li>parsing SMILES and working with the molecule object</li> 
<li>parsing SMARTS and substructure searches</li> 
<li>working with SMILES and SD files</li> 
<li>maximum common substructure</li> 
<li>translation between chemistry models</li> </ul> 
<h3>OpenBabel and RDKit</h3> 
<p> OpenBabel and RDKit are two open source cheminformatics toolkits with 
Python interfaces. I've used OpenBabel a bit, mostly through the high-levelpybel
 library.</p> 
<p> You might be thinking &quot;why not teach OpenBabel instead of 
OEChem&quot;? After all, the library is freely available so anyone can install 
it without needing a special license. I could teach it, but I don't have as 
much experience as I do with OEChem. There are certain nuances of every 
library, which I don't know for OpenBabel. I also think that OEChem is a better 
library for most use, if you have the money and consider proprietary software 
acceptable.</p> 
<p> As an example of a difference, OpenBabel follows the Daylight model and 
assumes that the right behavior is to convert everything into the same 
chemistry model. OEChem doesn't make that assumption and instead has functions 
to convert between different chemistry models; you have to call those 
functions. This causes small differences in how the libraries treat conditions 
like aromaticity. I have more experience with the OEChem way and can explain it 
better.</p> 
<p></p> If you are interested in me teaching specifically OpenBabel or RDKit 
then contact me.

<h3>Generating and searching fingerprints</h3> 
<p> I've developed a set of Python tools to work with molecular fingerprints. 
I'll describe how to use them to generate fingerprints and do Tanimoto searches.
</p> 
<h3>PyMol</h3> 
<p> PyMol is a very popular structure visualization program from DeLano 
Scientific. It contains an extensivePython programming interface which can be 
used for structure analysis, movie making, and more. I'll show you some of the 
things you can do with it.</p> 
<h3>numpy</h3> 
<p> numpy is a collection of numeric tools for Python, with an emphasis on 
arrays and linear algebra.</p> 
<h3>subprocess</h3> 
<p> Many chemistry programs are only available through the command line. I'll 
show how to use Python'ssubprocess module to call them from Python. </p> 
<h3>BeautifulSoup</h3> 
<p> A lot of data is available through web pages designed for people, not 
software.BeautifulSoup makes it easier to get access to that data in your 
programs. One example I can cover is how to get data from a PubChem web page.
</p> 
<h3>working with a relational database</h3> 
<p> Corporate compound databases are often stored in a relational database 
like Oracle. You don't need to be corporate IS to set up a relational database.
MySQL is a widely used free database server. I'll shows some examples of 
creating a database schema, loading compound data into the database, and 
searching the data set. I've developed a set of chemistry extensions to MySQL 
so you can get some experience in doing chemically-aware queries, like 
substructure searches and similarity ranking.</p> 
<h3>developing web applications</h3> 
<p> Django is a popular web development framework for Python which makes 
developing web applications much simpler than traditional CGI programming.</p> 
<p> These lectures will be based around developing a web application for 
substructure searches and will cover how to work with the database, generate 
templates, structure the URLs, using CSS, and Javascript interactivity with
JQuery. </p> 
<h3>Software development best practices</h3> 
<p> Software development is more than sitting down and programming. How do you 
keep track of changes to the code over time? If you change code, how do you 
figure out if the change broke something? How to multiple people work together 
on the same code base? What are some of the common development traps that 
people can get stuck in? Why do you need to care about security?</p> 
<p> Many of these are covered in Greg Wilson's Software Carpentry. I'll 
specifically talk about version control, project builds, testing withnose and 
development practices like code reviews,YAGNI and agile development. </p> 
<h3>XML</h3> 
<p> Despite the best efforts of some, there's still very little direct 
influence of XML in computational chemistry. We still use SD and SMILES files. 
But there is sometimes a need, especially when getting data from IT-oriented 
software developers. I'll show some examples of usingElementTree to read and 
extract fields from an XML file.</p> 
<h3>Using COM to control Excel</h3> 
<p> Python for Windows has excellent support for COM, which is how Windows 
programs can embed or control other Windows programs. Chemists use Excel a lot. 
It's not hard to write a Python program which opens Excel, creates a new 
spreadsheet, loads data into the spreadsheet, and creates a plot of the 
results. Not hard for experienced programmers that is. I'll show a few examples 
you can build off of and provide pointers of where to get more in-depth 
information.</p> 
<h3>R and Python</h3> 
<p> R is a great software environment for statistical computing and generating 
plots. If you are building models or doing data mining then you should know 
about this project. R includes its own programming language and a number of 
high-quality analysis packages. It's not a general purpose language like Python 
and it doesn't include the diversity of modules that Python has.</p> 
<p> RPy is an interface module which lets Python call R functions directly, 
including plotting. I've used it in a model calculation system using OEChem and 
other tools to compute descriptor values then passing the code over R to 
evalute the model.</p> 
<p> R and Python have different ways of doing things. RPy minimize the 
difference, it's still there. I'll describe some of the basic R data type, how 
to create them from Python, how to call the R functions through RPy, and how to 
understand the R documentation enough to be able to call it from Python.</p>
