<h3> Minimal Sphinx setup for autodocumenting Python modules </h3>  Published 
onApril 14, 2010 in documentation and Python. 11 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get a nice automatic documentation of your Python code 
usingSphinx. Sphinx can automagically slurp in all your docstrings, format them 
nicely, and render them as HTML or PDF output. Your docstrings end up looking 
so nice that sometimes it makes you want to write more of them! (which of 
course would result in better-documented code).<br>

<h3> Write Excel files with Python using xlwt </h3>  Published on September 
20, 2009 in excel, other software and Python. 8 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>In a previous post (which turned out to be pretty popular) I showed you how 
to read Excel files with Python. Now for the reverse: writing Excel files.</p> 
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to install the xlwt package by John Machin.</p> 
<h3>The basics</h3> 
<p>In order to write data to an Excel spreadsheet, first you have to 
initialize a Workbook object and then add a Worksheet object to that Workbook. 
It goes something like this:</p> 
<pre> import xlwt wbk = xlwt.Workbook() sheet = wbk.add_sheet('sheet 1') </pre>
<p>Now that the sheet is created, it&rsquo;s very easy to write data to it.</p>
<pre> # indexing is zero based, row then column sheet.write(0,1,'test text') 
</pre> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, save the workbook (you don&rsquo;t have to close it 
like you do with a file object)</p> 
<pre> wbk.save('test.xls') </pre> 
<h3>Digging deeper</h3> 
<h4>Overwriting cells</h4> 
<p>Worksheet objects, by default, give you a warning when you try to overwrite:
</p> 
<pre> sheet.write(0,0,'test') sheet.write(0,0,'oops') # returns error: # 
Exception: Attempt to overwrite cell: sheetname=u'sheet 1' rowx=0 colx=0</pre> 
<p>To change this behavior, use the <code>cell_overwrite_ok=True</code> kwarg 
when creating the worksheet, like so:</p> 
<pre> sheet2 = wbk.add_sheet('sheet 2', cell_overwrite_ok=True) 
sheet2.write(0,0,'some text') sheet2.write(0,0,'this should overwrite')</pre> 
<p>Now you can overwrite sheet 2 (but not sheet 1).</p> 
<h4>More goodies</h4> 
<pre> # Initialize a style style = xlwt.XFStyle() # Create a font to use with 
the style font = xlwt.Font() font.name = 'Times New Roman' font.bold = True # 
Set the style's font to this new one you set up style.font = font # Use the 
style when writing sheet.write(0, 0, 'some bold Times text', style)</pre> 
<p>xlwt allows you to format your spreadsheets on a cell-by-cell basis or by 
entire rows; it also allows you to add hyperlinks or even formulas. Rather than 
recap it all here, I encourage you to grab a copy of the source code, in which 
you can find the examples directory. Some highlights from the examples 
directory in the source code:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><code>dates.py</code>, which shows how to use the different date formats
</li> 
<li><code>hyperlinks.py</code>, which shows how to create hyperlinks (<em>
hint: you need to use a formula</em>)</li> 
<li><code>merged.py</code>, which shows how to merge cells</li> 
<li><code>row_styles.py</code>, which shows how to apply styles to entire rows.
</li> </ul> 
<h3>Non-trivial example</h3> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of some data where the dates not formatted well for 
easy import into Excel:</p> 
<pre> 20 Sep, 263, 1148, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 12.1, 13.9, 1+1, 19.9 20 Sep, 263, 
1118, 0, 1, 0, 360, 0, 14.1, 15.3, 1+1, 19.9 20 Sep, 263, 1048, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 
14.2, 15.1, 1+1, 19.9 20 Sep, 263, 1018, 0, 1, 0, 360, 0, 14.2, 15.9, 1+1, 19.9 
20 Sep, 263, 0948, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 14.4, 15.3, 1+1, 19.9</pre> 
<p>The first column has the day and month separated by a space. The second 
column is year-day, which we&rsquo;ll ignore. The third column has the time. 
The data we&rsquo;re interested in is in the 9th column (temperature). The goal 
is to have a simple Excel file where the first column is date, and the second 
column is temperature.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a [heavily commented] script to do just that. It assumes that 
you have the data saved as<code>weather.data.exampl</code>e.</p> 
<pre> ''' Script to convert awkwardly-formatted weather data into an Excel 
spreadsheet using Python and xlwt. ''' from datetime import datetime import 
xlwt # Create workbook and worksheet wbk = xlwt.Workbook() sheet = 
wbk.add_sheet('temperatures') # Set up a date format style to use in the # 
spreadsheet excel_date_fmt = 'M/D/YY h:mm' style = xlwt.XFStyle() 
style.num_format_str = excel_date_fmt # Weather data has no year, so assume 
it's the current year. year = datetime.now().year # Convert year to a string 
because we'll be # building a date string below year = str(year) # The format 
of the date string we'll be building python_str_date_fmt = '%d %b-%H%M-%Y' row 
= 0 # row counter f = open('weather.data.example') for line in f: # separate 
fields by commas L = line.rstrip().split(',') # skip this line if all fields 
not present if len(L) &lt; 12: continue # Fields have leading spaces, so strip 
'em date = L[0].strip() time = L[2].strip() # Datatypes matter. If we kept this 
as a string # in Python, it would be a string in the Excel sheet. temperature = 
float(L[8]) # Construct a date string based on the string # date format we 
specified above date_string = date + '-' + time + '-' + year # Use the newly 
constructed string to create a # datetime object date_object = 
datetime.strptime(date_string, python_str_date_fmt) # Write the data, using the 
style defined above. sheet.write(row,0,date_object, style) 
sheet.write(row,1,temperature) row += 1 wbk.save('reformatted.data.xls')</pre>

Also check outxlutils for more functionality, which I plan to play around with 
next.</p> <br>

<h3> Python script to package Latex projects for distribution </h3>  Published 
onMarch 13, 2009 in latex and Python. 3 Comments Tags: archiving, latex, Python.
<br> <br>

<p>This is probably one of those scripts that will evolve over time, but 
I&rsquo;m posting it now in case someone can get some use out of it. My problem 
was this:</p> 
<p>I had many, many figures in my working directory, but I didn&rsquo;t use 
all of them in the Latex document. I was trying to figure out a way to send the 
source files &mdash; *.tex, *.cls, *.bst, *.bib, etc, plus only the images 
files that were actually in the document &mdash; to someone else so they could 
edit on their own and compile on their own. I didn&rsquo;t want to set up a 
version control (SVN, etc), I just wanted a tar file.</p> 
<p>After some poking around I couldn&rsquo;t find anything already made that 
would do this (Kile has an Archive menu item, but this doesn&rsquo;t include 
figures). It was easy enough to get a Python script going.</p> 
<p>This script parses an input file, looks at the various documents and 
figures that are included, and archives them in a tar.gz file which can then be 
sent to someone. Note that as it stands, it only looks two levels deep for 
\include tags. If I use this more I&rsquo;ll have to make it recursive 
(it&rsquo;s not obvious to me how to do that, I haven&rsquo;t used recursion 
much before).</p> 
<p>Consider this script a rough draft. It worked perfectly for me, but your 
mileage may vary.</p> 
<pre> &quot;&quot;&quot; This script gathers the necessary images and files 
(from an arbitrarily large number of unneeded figures) and puts it all in a 
tarball for distribution. Usage: latexpackager.py main.tex dissertation.tar.gz 
&quot;&quot;&quot; import sys import re import os import tarfile def 
find_references(f): '''Returns a list of Latex files that f refers to, by 
parsing \include, \bibliography, \bibliographystyle, \input, etc. If nothing 
was found, returns an empty list.''' s = open(f).read() # Find the .tex files. 
texs = [] for i in 
re.finditer(r&quot;&quot;&quot;[^%]\\include\{(.*)\}&quot;&quot;&quot;, s): 
texs.append(i.groups()[0]+'.tex') # Find the .bib files. bibs = [] for i in 
re.finditer(r&quot;&quot;&quot;[^%]\\bibliography\{(.*)\}&quot;&quot;&quot;, 
s): bibs.append(i.groups()[0]+'.bib') # Find the styles. styles = [] for i in 
re.finditer(r&quot;&quot;&quot;[^%]\\bibliographystyle\{(.*)\}&quot;&quot;&quot;, 
s): styles.append(i.groups()[0]+'.bst') # Find the document class description 
file docclass = [] for i in 
re.finditer(r&quot;&quot;&quot;[^%]\\documentclass\{(.*)\}&quot;&quot;&quot;, 
s): docclass.append(i.groups()[0]+'.cls') # Look for any inputs. inputs = [] 
for i in re.finditer(r&quot;&quot;&quot;[^%]\\input\{(.*)\}&quot;&quot;&quot;, 
s): texs.append(i.groups()[0]+'.tex') # Here is everything that was referenced 
in f: return texs + bibs + styles + docclass + inputs def find_figures(f): 
'''Returns a list of figures found in the file. Only looks in .tex files. If 
not a .tex file or no figures found, returns an empty list.''' # Short circuit 
if not a .tex file. if f[-4:] != '.tex': return [] includegraphics = 
r&quot;&quot;&quot;[^%].*\\includegraphics\[.*\]\{([^\}]*)\}&quot;&quot;&quot; 
figures = [] s = open(f).read() matches = re.finditer(includegraphics, s) for 
match in matches: basename = match.groups()[0] if basename[-4] == '.': # that 
is, it has an extension already. # This is for things like .png images. 
figures.append(basename) else: figures.append(basename + '.pdf') 
figures.append(basename + '.eps') return figures main = sys.argv[1] tarfn = 
sys.argv[2] projectdir, main = os.path.split(main) if projectdir == '': 
projectdir = os.getcwd() keepers = find_references(main) # Don't forget to add 
the main .tex file. keepers.append(main) # For each of those that main.tex 
referenced, look for more. # These are files referenced two levels deep. for f 
in keepers: if f[-4:] != '.tex': continue keepers.extend(find_references(f)) # 
Now look for graphics. figures = [] for f in keepers: 
figures.extend(find_figures(f)) #paths = [os.path.join(projectdir, i) for i in 
keepers + figures] paths = keepers + figures tarball = tarfile.open(tarfn, 
'w:gz') for path in paths: print path tarball.add(path) tarball.close()</pre>

<h3> RPy: statistics in R from Python </h3>  Published on July 25, 2008 in 
Python and R. 3 Comments Tags: linear regression, Python, R, statistics. <br>

<br> 
<p>R is a free, open source statistics package written by statisticians, for 
statisticians. Python on the other hand lacks a comprehensive statistics 
package.RPy allows you to combine the power of Python with the power of R for 
an unbeatable combination in data analysis.</p> 
<p>Note that in order to use R from Python, you need to know a little of both 
. . . so the learning curve can be steep. You also need to have a feel for what 
would be easy in R and what would be easy in Python.</p> 
<p>There are some detailed examples below if you want to skip right to 
&lsquo;em.</p> 
<p>I use Python for most tasks, but when I need high-powered stats, I embed R 
code in my Python scripts to perform the analysis.</p> 
<p>Disclaimer: I figured all of this stuff out by trial and error. The RPy 
documentation, while complete, was difficult for me to make sense of when I was 
learning. If there&rsquo;s a better way to do things, please let me know! For 
the details that I don&rsquo;t cover here, check theonline documentation </p> 
<h3>Why use R?</h3> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll need R if you want to do any sort of sophisticated (or even 
not-so-sophisiticated) statistical analysis. There are no solid statistics 
libraries that I&rsquo;ve come across for Python . . . but maybe that&rsquo;s 
because R is the best possible statistics library there could be.</p> 
<p>Be warned however that accessing R from Python can get tricky at times. 
I&rsquo;ve tried to outline some of what I&rsquo;ve learned here to make it 
easier for others.</p> 
<p>Why use RPy instead of writing files out to R, then using R scripts to deal 
with it? I did this for a little while and found that it was too much work to 
maintain two separate code bases . . . one for Python, then one for R. If I 
changed anything in the output of a Python script, I&rsquo;d have to fire up R 
and open my R scripts to modify and debug them. I&rsquo;ve found that using RPy 
lets me put all my code in one spot, resulting in fewer bugs and less 
maintenance.</p> 
<h3>R and Python are separate . . .</h3> 
<p>I found that the easiest way to think about this is to think about doing 
things &ldquo;inside R&rdquo; or &ldquo;inside Python&rdquo;. Things that are 
to be done inside R are typically wrapped in a string (a Python string). For 
example, this creates a variable inside R calledx with a value of 5.</p> 
<pre>from rpy import * r('x=5')</pre> 
<p>Assuming this was typed into a fresh Python session, Python has no idea 
about the existence of the variablex! It works in reverse, too: R has no idea 
about what&rsquo;s in the Python namespace. So you can do this in Python:</p> 
<pre>x = 'I'm a Python string'</pre> 
<p>and the variable x inside R is still the same:</p> 
<pre>r('print(x)') # still 5</pre> 
<h3>. . . but they can talk to each other</h3> 
<p>RPy does some automatic conversions:</p> 
<pre>x_from_R = r('x') # 5</pre> 
<p>What happened here is that RPy looked at what x was inside R, saw that it 
was an integer, and returned that integer to Python, which assigned it to the 
Python variablex_from_R. So that&rsquo;s how you get data from R to Python: by 
sending a string (the variable name you want to retrieve in R) to ther object.
</p> 
<p>At first you might think this is how you send data from Python to R:</p> 
<pre>r('x_from_python') = x #SyntaxError: can't assign to function call</pre> 
<p>Nope. Turns out you have to use the r.assign() function to do that:</p> 
<pre>r.assign('x_from_python', x) r('print(x_from_python)') # 'I'm a Python 
string'</pre> 
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you get data from Python to R: by using the r.assign() 
function, first giving the name of the variable you want to be assigned in R 
followed by the Python object to be sent to R.</p> 
<h3>Other data types</h3> 
<p>OK, so you can get integers back from R. And as you can imagine, strings 
work the same way. But what about more complex data types? Thislist of 
conversions tells you which R objects will be converted into which Python 
objects. It&rsquo;s pretty intuitive, a string becomes a string, a list becomes 
a list, etc.</p> 
<p>But then there are things like data frames in R, which have row names and 
column names.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not on that list linked above, but an R data frame is converted 
to a Python dictionary. For example, the Motor Trend car data set, which comes 
standard in R, is a data frame.</p> 
<pre>from rpy import * r('print(head(mtcars))') # print just the first 6 
lines. Note the variable names. # Returns: # mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am 
gear carb # Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 # Mazda RX4 Wag 
21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 # Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 
18.61 1 1 4 1 # Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 # Hornet 
Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 # Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 
2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1</pre> 
<p>Now send the whole thing to Python and check the keys of the dictionary 
that is created:</p> 
<pre>mt = r('mtcars') mt.keys()</pre> 
<p>Note that the keys are the same as the variable names in the dataframe.</p> 
<p>Just like you get a Python dictionary from a dataframe, you can send a 
dictionary to R:</p> 
<pre>r.assign('df', dict(a=1, b=2, c=3)) r('print(df)') r('names(df)') </pre> 
<p>May have to convert it into a dataframe once inside R though:</p> 
<pre> r('df = data.frame(df)') </pre> 
<h3>R functions</h3> 
<p>So far, with the exception of r.assign(), we&rsquo;ve just been sending 
strings to ther object. But the r object also has methods. Unfortunately, you 
can&rsquo;t see them all using IPython&rsquo;s introspection. Personally I find 
that I don&rsquo;t use this functionality that much, (I user.assign() to get 
the data into R and then operate on it in there) but here it is for 
completeness.</p> 
<p>There is a trick here. Remember, before we were sending a string to the r 
object and it was executing the code inside R:</p> 
<pre>r('x=5')</pre> 
<p>But when you use a method of the r object, you pass it raw Python objects. 
For example, you can plot a Python list in R using theplot() method of the r 
object:</p> 
<pre>x = [1,2,3] r.plot(x)</pre> 
<p>There are some slight name changes though. R tends to use a &ldquo;.&rdquo; 
as a spacer in function names, like &ldquo;_&rdquo; tends to be used in Python. 
The &ldquo;.&rdquo; however is special in Python, so in method names of ther 
object, &ldquo;.&rdquo; is converted to &ldquo;_&rdquo;. For example, R&rsquo;s
t.test() function becomes r.t_test(). </p> 
<p>These methods of the r object are what Python sees, so that&rsquo;s why 
their names have to be changed. On the other hand, you call R function with its 
true name when you send ther object a string, like we were doing before. So 
both of these refer to the same underlying t-test function in R:</p> 
<pre>r.t_test r('t.test')</pre> 
<p>This next one is tricky. First, since print is a Python function, it needs 
to have a slightly different name when you want to use the version in R. So an 
underscore is added to the end. Second, what&rsquo;s in the parentheses is a 
Python string. So all that will get printed is the string, &lsquo;x&rsquo; . . 
. not 5, or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Python string&rdquo; or anything else.</p> 
<pre>r.print_('x') # 'x'</pre> 
<p>In practice though, if I want to print something I&rsquo;ll either use 
Python&rsquo;sprint or if I want to print something from R, I&rsquo;ll do this:
</p> 
<pre>r('print(x)') # prints 5</pre> 
<h3>Plotting examples</h3> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s are a couple of examples of creating a plot. In each case a 
plot is created of the list 1,2,3. These are trivial examples, but they 
illustrate different ways of getting data to and from R.</p> 
<h4>Option 1: Do everything in R</h4> 
<p>You can execute arbitrary R commands by sending them as a string to the r 
object. Here, everything is done in R: a list is created and plotted. In this 
example, the variablex is never seen by Python.</p> 
<pre>from rpy import * r(&quot;&quot;&quot; y = c(1,2,3) plot(y) 
&quot;&quot;&quot;)</pre> 
<p>Note that you can send many R commands in a multi-line string.</p> 
<h4>Option 2: Use a method of the r object</h4> 
<p>Here, we start with a Python list, and then send it as the argument to the 
r.plot() method.</p> 
<pre>from rpy import * y = [1,2,3] r.plot(y)</pre> 
<h4>Option 3: Get a list from R and plot it with matplotlib in Python</h4> 
<p>This trivial because you don&rsquo;t gain anything from making a list in R 
instead of Python, but it shows that you can send data both ways.</p> 
<pre>from r import * import pylab as p y = r('c(1,2,3)') p.plot(y) p.show()
</pre> 
<h4>Option 4: Use r.assign() to get data to R, then call it inside R</h4> 
<p>I tend to use this method a lot with large data sets. The idea is to pass 
the data into R once, then you can use it from inside R. The trick is to use the
r.assign() method.</p> 
<pre>from rpy import * y = [1,2,3] r.assign('Y', y) r('plot(Y)')</pre> 
<h3>Getting help on R functions</h3> 
<p>Use the r.help() function. For example, to view the help on anova:</p> 
<pre>r.help(anova)</pre> 
<p>This displays the help on screen; it doesn&rsquo;t return a string.</p> 
<h3>Non-trivial examples</h3> 
<p>Plotting and printing things are not what you&rsquo;d want to use R and RPy 
for. Instead, you&rsquo;d want to use them for things that you can&rsquo;t do 
in available packages for Python.</p> 
<p>Here are some examples where R can really fill in the gaps in 
Python&rsquo;s statistical functionality. Anything you can do in R, you can do 
from Python. Given the wide variety of packages available for R, this is some 
stupendous power at your fingertips. Now to learn how to wield it!</p> 
<h4>Linear models in R</h4> 
<p>Say I have a Python script already up and running, and it returns some data 
. . . and I want to know if the slope of two variables is significant. I 
haven&rsquo;t found any statistics libraries for Python, but in R this kind of 
functionality comes standard, in the functionlm().</p> 
<p>Viewing the help for lm(), you can see that it takes a model specification, 
like &ldquo;y~x&rdquo; which means &ldquo;y on x&rdquo;. Now, the components of 
this model specification, y and x, can either refer to variables in the R 
workspace (which is separate from Python, remember) or they can be variables in 
a dataframe which is supplied in an optional argument tolm().</p> 
<p>So first we need to figure out how to send the data to R; performing the 
linear regression should be trivial, then we need to get the data back out.</p> 
<p>First, let&rsquo;s set up some test data in Python:</p> 
<pre> import numpy as npy x = npy.arange(10) y = npy.arange(10) + 
npy.random.standard_normal(x.shape)&lt;/pre&gt; Now send it to R: 
&lt;pre&gt;r.assign('x',x) r.assign('y',y)</pre> 
<p>(exercise for the reader: instead of assigning x and y individually, how 
would you get them into R as a dataframe?)</p> 
<p>In R, run the linear model and save it as a variable in R. Here, I&rsquo;m 
simultaneously saving it as a Python dictionary (sneaky!)</p> 
<pre>LM = r('linear_model = lm(y~x)')</pre> 
<p>OK, here&rsquo;s where it take a little exploring. The dictionary you get 
back may take some navigating. Looking at it for a little bit, you might notice 
the &lsquo;coefficients&rsquo; key of the dictionary LM, which in turn has two 
more keys: &lsquo;(Intercept)&rsquo; and &lsquo;x&rsquo;.</p>

<p>But what about a P-value for the slope? It&rsquo;s nowhere to be seen in 
that dictionary. Turns out, you need thesummary() function in R, and it takes 
as its input a linear model (among other possible inputs, but here we&rsquo;re 
just using a linear model). So save it in R (just in case) and simultaneously 
save it in Python:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the r-squared and adjusted r-squared,</p> 
<pre>R_squared = summary['adj.r.squared']</pre> 
<p>but no P value. What gives? Turns out Python can&rsquo;t convert everything 
perfectly, and a little more exploration is in order. Try printing the summary 
from R:</p> 
<pre>r('print(LM_summary)')</pre> 
<p>Well, that makes more sense, and you can see the P value for the slope is 
2.75E-5. But how to extract it from Python?</p>

F-statistic: 72.7 on 1 and 8 DF, p-value: 2.753e-05</pre> 
<p>The trick is to match output from the summary printout in R with the 
dictionary returned to Python. Here, it looks like the key 
&lsquo;coefficients&rsquo; in the summary dictionary in Python gives the 
numbers in the 2nd row, 3rd column:</p> 
<pre>P = summary['coefficients'][1,2]</pre> 
<p>Whew, and there you have it. See, it takes some digging around to get what 
you need, but now since I&rsquo;ve done the work for you, you can now do linear 
regressions from Python. All together it looks like this (can be wrapped in a 
function or class for your own reuse):</p> 
<pre>r.assign('x', x) r.assign('y', y) LM = r('linear_model = lm(y~x)') 
summary = r('summary_LM = summary(linear_model)') slope = 
LM['coefficients']['x'] intercept = LM['coefficients']['(Intercept)'] P = 
summary['coefficients'][1,2]</pre> 
<h4>Redundancy analysis</h4> 
<p>OK, say you have this data set to perform redundancy analysis (RDA) on. 
First, you need the packagevegan installed, which is fantastic for multivariate 
stats. It&rsquo;s probably best to fire up R proper (from a command line, or 
the GUI if you have it in Windows or OSX) and run</p> 
<pre>install.packages(&quot;vegan&quot;, dep=T)</pre> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a heavily commented script, rpy-demo.py, that will:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>load and format the data included in the script</li> 
<li>send the data to R</li> 
<li>perform an RDA in R</li> 
<li>plot the ordination</li> 
<li>save the ordination as a PNG</li> 
<li>print the variance explained by constrained and unconstrained axes as well 
as each RDA axis.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you have RPy installed and the vegan package installed, you should be 
able to just run this Python script.</p> 
<p>Often-run analyses that you need R for can be wrapped in a class or module 
to encapsulate your data analysis needs, so you don&rsquo;t need to clutter 
your code with it. Once things are set up that way, it would be as easy as</p> 
<pre> from myRstuff import lm, rda results = lm(x,y) ordination = rda(data)
</pre> 
<p>For much, much more see the online documentation for RPy, but hopefully I 
gave you enough to at least get started.</p> <br>

<h3> Polar bar plot in Python </h3>  Published on July 20, 2008 in matplotlib, 
plotting and Python. 2 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to create a polar bar plot in matplotlib.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The trick is just to specify that you want polar coordinates when you 
create the axis. Then create a bar plot as normal.</p> 
<pre> from matplotlib.pyplot import figure, show from math import pi fig = 
figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(111, polar=True) x = [30,60,90,120,150,180] x = 
[i*pi/180 for i in x] # convert to radians ax.bar(x,[1,2,3,4,5,6], width=0.4) 
show()</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>Note that in the above example the &ldquo;right&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;clockwise-most&rdquo; edge is lined up with each specified x value. You 
can change this by subtractingwidth / 2 to each of the x values to center the 
bars on the x-values, like this:</p> 
<pre> from matplotlib.pyplot import figure, show from math import pi width = 
0.4 # width of the bars (in radians) fig = figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(111, 
polar=True) x = [30,60,90,120,150,180] # Convert to radians and subtract half 
the width # of a bar to center it. x = [i*pi/180 - width/2 for i in x] 
ax.bar(x,[1,2,3,4,5,6], width=width) show()</pre> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Get funky . . . </h3> 
<p>The following is slightly modifed from the matplotlib examples:</p> 
<pre> import numpy as npy import matplotlib.cm as cm from matplotlib.pyplot 
import figure, show, rc # force square figure and square axes (looks better for 
polar, IMHO) fig = figure(figsize=(8,8)) ax = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 
0.8], polar=True) N = 20 theta = npy.arange(0.0, 2*npy.pi, 2*npy.pi/N) # random 
angles radii = 10*npy.random.rand(N) # random bar heights width = 
npy.pi/4*npy.random.rand(N) # random widths # Create the bar plot bars = 
ax.bar(theta, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0) # Step through bars (a list of 
Rectangle objects) and # change color based on its height and set its alpha 
transparency # to 0.5 for r,bar in zip(radii, bars): bar.set_facecolor( 
cm.jet(r/10.)) bar.set_alpha(0.5) show()</pre> 
<p>And the result:</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<h3> Interactive subplots: make all x-axes move together </h3>  Published on 
May 3, 2008 in matplotlib, plotting and Python. 2 Comments Tags: axes, 
intertactive plotting, subplot. <br>
<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to make subplots that share an x-axis, so that when 
you pan and zoom on one axis, the others automatically pan and zoom as well. 
The key to this functionality is thesharex keyword argument, which is used when 
creating an axis. Here&rsquo;s some example code and a video of the resulting 
interaction.Continue reading &lsquo;Interactive subplots: make all x-axes move

<h3> Use Sphinx for documentation </h3>  Published on April 25, 2008 in Python 
andutilities. 14 Comments Tags: documentation, sphinx, tutorial. <br>
<br>

<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> After some folks requested it in the comments, 
I wrote another post,A minimal Sphinx setup for autodocumenting Python modules. 
You might want to check this out if you&rsquo;re specifically interested in 
automatically documenting your code with Sphinx.</em></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of code documentation lately, and I 
decided to try and figure out the best tool to use. I found it. It&rsquo;s 
calledSphinx, and you can see what the documentation looks like by checking out 
the documentation for Python itself (v.2.6 and 3.0).<br>

get started using Sphinx.Continue reading &lsquo;Use Sphinx for

<h3> Insert content into TiddlyWikis with this Python script </h3>  Published 
onApril 17, 2008 in Python and TiddlyWiki. 3 Comments Tags: image, script, 
TiddlyWiki. <br>
<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been generating many figures, and I want to be able to find them 
again and browse them easily. Organizing them on disk just isn&rsquo;t cutting 
it. My solution for now is to use a localTiddlyWiki as the glue for my figures, 
since I can embed figures in tiddlers (the microcontent entries that are the 
bread and butter of TiddlyWikis), and tag and search those entries. Bonus: I 
can zip everything up and send TiddlyWiki + images to my advisor so he can 
browse and search them as well.</p> 
<p>Try this Python script, addtiddler.py, to insert tiddlers into an existing 
TiddlyWiki. You can optionally specify an image name (relative to the output 
file, see the documentation in the source code) to be embedded. You can use 
this script from the command line using options, or import it into another 
script.</p> 
<p>I tried to add lots of comments so you can modify it for your own needs. 
Let me know if you find bugs so I can fix them.</p> <br>

<h3> Advanced sorting: sorting by key </h3>  Published on April 14, 2008 in 
Python. 3 Comments Tags: key, Python, sort. <br>
<br>

<p>The sort() method of list objects in Python is quite flexible. By default, 
it sorts on the first thing in each item of the list, which is exactly what you 
would expect. For example, a list of strings is sorted by the first letter of 
each string. What if you wanted to sort by the second letter of each string? Or 
sort a list of people&rsquo;s names by last name?Continue reading
