<li> </li> </ul>  A dauntingly large number of Zope and Python resources are 
available. The hardest choice is, &quot;Where to begin?&quot; We've whittled it 
down to the straight and narrow for you. Don't stray from this path until 
you've reached its end. After that, stray far and wide. You'll know where. Or 
check out the Additional Resources down below if you'd prefer a series of 
interesting but endless rabbit holes. 
<p><em>Special note: TriZPUG is not a substitute for primary sources. TriZPUG 
supports Zope and Python education, and is part of the Zope and Python 
communities, but does not attempt to replace the primary educational materials 
of the Zope and Python communities writ large. If you are brand spanking new to 
Python, please see themain Python community help page.</em></p> 
<p>Beginning Python: From Novice to Professional<br>
 Good introduction for 
students with a little programming experience. Brand new second edition is out 
now!</p> 
<p>The author's website has an excellent ten minute Python overview.<br>
 See 
below for two other excellent recommendations. </p> <br>
<br>

<h2>Beginner's Note</h2> 
<p>If you are coming to Python as your first programming language, you have 
made a good choice. There is consensus among many computer scientists: Python 
may rate as the best choice for learning to program. If you are finding 
learning how to program is more difficult than you thought, consider thisgood 
advice from the Director of Research at Google. </p>

Important Python Projects</p> 
<h3>Python</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>While you are waiting for dead tree book delivery, if you have the stamina 
and the courage, there's always theOfficial Python Tutorial written by our 
valiantBDFL.</li> 
<li>An ocean of Python software awaits you at the Python Package Index, 
formerly known as the &quot;Cheese Shop.&quot;</li> 
<li>Planet Python is a comprehensive aggregator of Python blogs.</li> 
<li>There are many Python related email lists you can join, including the 
tutor list for newbies.</li> 
<li>The Active State Python Cookbook contains thousands of recipes. Not to be 
confused with adead tree cookbook. Looking at well written Python code is a 
great way to learn Python.</li> 
<li>Think you're smart? Some people claim you can learn Python in 10 minutes.
</li> 
<h4>Python Documentation</h4> 
<li>Python has an official documentation center which can be pretty daunting 
for the novice and includes:
<ul> 
<li>Beginners' Guides</li> 
<li>Frequently Asked Questions</li> 
<li>Python Enhancement Proposals</li> 
<li>Essays from the BDFL</li> 
<li>How-Tos</li> 
<li>Latest Stable Version Documentation Index</li> </ul> </li> 
<h4>Python Community</h4> 
<li>The official Python Wiki contains community (i.e., haphazardly) maintained 
articles such as:
<ul> 
<li>a list of Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</li> 
<li>a list of Python-aware Code Editors</li> 
<li>a world-wide list of Python User Groups</li> 
<li>a world-wide calendar of Python Events</li> </ul> </li>

<h4>Free Online Python Books</h4> 
<li>There are many free online Python books: 
<ul> 
<li>Learn Python is an interactive online set of Python tutorials.</li> 
<li>Dive Into Python, by Mark Pilgrim of Apex, was the greatest programming 
book ever written. Unfortunately, halfway through the book, all the examples 
were based on now-defunct web services. However, the new edition,Dive Into 
Python 3 doesn't suffer from that defect, even though it no longer employs the 
radically Pythonic way of teaching Python we loved in its predecessor.</li> 
<li>Think Python was formerly known as &quot;How To Think Like A Computer 
Scientist&quot; and was several years in the making.</li> 
<li>How To Think Like A Computer Scientist is still available, though, and has 
been translated into many languages.</li> 
<li>A Byte of Python is available in both Python 2 and Python 3 versions and 
is being translated into many languages.</li> 
<li>Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python is a free online book.</li> 
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented Design Patterns in 
Python is an essential and monumental tome of computer science.</li> 
<li>Software Carpentry is an introduction to the art of software engineering 
using Python. Titus Brown has been working onAdvanced Software Carpentry.</li>

Kuhlman's comprehensive &quot;A Python Book.&quot;</li> </ul> </li> 
<h4>Python Videos</h4> 
<li>There are many Python video tutorials on the web: 
<ul> 
<li>Blip.tv is the official upload point for PyCon videos. There's a somewhat 
random index of those videos at Blip.tv. However, a more usable index including 
links to the presentation materials for each video may be found at the PyCon 
site's schedule of talks for2010 and 2009.</li> 
<li>Show Me Do is a place for Python video tutorials.</li> 
<li>Python is the teaching language at MIT. They put their Introduction to 
Computer Science course online as video.</li> 
<li>Bucky lives in Raleigh and has 43 Python Tutorials (Windows-centric) on 
YouTube (along with WxPython and Blender tutorials).</li> 
<li>Miro Community hosts a small collection of Python videos.</li> 
<li>Some of Alex Martelli's Python talks at Google are available as video.</li>
<li>Some of David Beazley's courses on Python concurrency are available as 
video.</li> </ul> </li> 
<h4>Python Periodicals</h4> 
<li>There have been many attempts at sustaining Python periodicals: 
<ul> 
<li>Python Rag is a collection of monthly PDF files of interest to Python 
beginners.</li> 
<li>Python Magazine was a new kid on the block. It may be back again sometime. 
We hope at least the archive comes back.</li> 
<li>PyZine is no longer published but has a nice archive.</li> 
<li>The Python Papers an an annual collection of high-minded monographs about 
Python. Or the journal of Kiwi PyCon. Or both.</li> 
<li>Python Weekly is a marketing campaign which looks to be put together by a 
bot scraping various Python feeds. Some interesting links, nonetheless.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<h4>Python Concurrency</h4> 
<li>The author of Python for Dummies shows you how to use threading in Python 
(butonly if you have to). <br>
<br>
More Python threading resources: 
<ul> 
<li>Tutorial on Threads Programming with Python</li> 
<li>Basic Threading in Python</li> 
<li>Understanding Threading in Python</li> 
<li>Thread Synchronization Mechanisms in Python</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Today there are much more sophisticated approaches to concurrency in Python
 than simple threading.</li> 
<li>Be sure not to miss David Beazley's Curious Course on Coroutines and 
Concurrency (Video: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3).</li> 
<li>See how you can run your own Python MPI 20-node computing cluster for only 
$2/hour.</li> 
<h4>Other Python Resources</h4> 
<li>A child's garden of Python Quick References might be just what you need.
</li> 
<li>Create your own Python Cheat Sheets</li>

Python Module of the Week.</li> 
<li>David Mertz wrote a series of indispensable columns for IBM Developerworks 
calledCharming Python as well as a fantastic free online book called Text 
Processing in Python.</li> 
<li>David Goodger, Secretary of the Python Software Foundation, can show you 
how toCode Like a Pythonista.</li>

podcasts, and screencasts.</li> 
<li>The O'Reilly Python Devcenter has a few articles to note.</li> 
<li>The Python Enterprise Application Kit (PEAK) was an important source of 
information about Python eggs, setuptools, and easy_install. Now the Python 
community is more aboutdistribute and pip.</li> 
<li>Make Python go fast.</li> 
<li>Learn about Python and CGI from UVA or the BDFL.</li> 
<li> Some recommended alternative books for learning Python are: 
<p>Python For Dummies<br>
