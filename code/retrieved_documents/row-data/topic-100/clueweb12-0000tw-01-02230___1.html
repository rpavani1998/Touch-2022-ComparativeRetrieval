<h1>Python Data Analysis Library&para;</h1> 
<p><em>pandas</em> is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing 
high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the
Python programming language.</p> 
<h2>What problem does <em>pandas</em> solve?&para;</h2> 
<p>Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so 
for data analysis and modeling.<em>pandas</em> helps fill this gap, enabling 
you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to 
switch to a more domain specific language like R.</p> 
<p>Combined with the excellent IPython toolkit and other libraries, the 
environment for doing data analysis in Python excels in performance, 
productivity, and the ability to collaborate.</p> 
<p><em>pandas</em> does not implement significant statistical modeling outside 
of linear and panel regression; for this, look to thestatsmodels project. More 
work is still needed to make Python a first class statistical modeling 
environment, but we are well on our way toward that goal.</p> 
<h2>Library Highlights&para;</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Tools for <strong>reading and writing data</strong> between in-memory data 
structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL 
databases, and the fast HDF5 format;</li> 
<li>Intelligent <strong>data alignment</strong> and integrated handling of 
<strong>missing data</strong>: gain automatic label-based alignment in 
computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;</li> 
<li>Flexible <strong>reshaping</strong> and pivoting of data sets;</li> 
<li>Intelligent label-based <strong>slicing</strong>, <strong>fancy indexing
</strong>, and <strong>subsetting</strong> of large data sets;</li> 
<li>Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for <strong>size 
mutability</strong>;</li> 
<li>Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful <strong>group by</strong> 
engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;</li> 
<li>High performance <strong>merging and joining</strong> of data sets;</li> 
<li><strong>Hierarchical axis indexing</strong> provides an intuitive way of 
working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;</li> 
<li><strong>Time series</strong>-functionality: date range generation and 
frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear 
regressions, date shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time 
offsets and join time series without losing data;</li> 
<li>The library has been ruthlessly <strong>optimized for performance</strong>
, with critical code paths compiled to C;</li> 
<li>Python with <em>pandas</em> is in use in a wide variety of <strong>
academic and commercial</strong> domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, 
Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Why not R?&para;</h2> 
<p>First of all, we love open source R! It is the most widely-used open source 
environment for statistical modeling and graphics, and it provided some early 
inspiration for<em>pandas</em> features. R users will be pleased to find this 
library adopts some of the best concepts of R, like the foundational DataFrame 
(one user familiar with R has described<em>pandas</em> as &ldquo;R data.frame 
on steroids&rdquo;). But<em>pandas</em> also seeks to solve some frustrations 
common to R users:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>R has barebones data alignment and indexing functionality, leaving much 
work to the user.<em>pandas</em> makes it easy and intuitive to work with 
messy, irregularly indexed data, like time series data.<em>pandas</em> also 
provides rich tools, like hierarchical indexing, not found in R;</li> 
<li>R is not well-suited to general purpose programming and system development.
<em>pandas</em> enables you to do large-scale data processing seamlessly when 
developing your production applications;</li> 
<li>Hybrid systems connecting R to a low-productivity systems language like 
Java, C++, or C# suffer from significantly reduced agility and maintainability, 
and you&rsquo;re still stuck developing the system components in a 
low-productivity language;</li> 
<li>R&rsquo;s &ldquo;copy-left&rdquo; GPL license prevents use in most 
commercial software development. Python and<em>pandas</em> use a permissive BSD 
license allowing use in commercial software.</li> </ul> 
<h2>What about Java, C++, and C#?&para;</h2> 
<p>While systems languages satisfy your need for performance, low-productivity 
and low-maintainability are deal-breakers for a research environment. Some of 
our users have found themselves able to replace Java systems with 20% as much 
Python code!</p> 
<p>Python + <em>pandas</em> is fast enough for most production use cases while 
still providing all the advantages of an agile research environment.</p> 
<h2>Who do our users have to say?&para;</h2> 
<blockquote> <br>
</blockquote> <strong>Roni Israelov, PhD</strong>  Portfolio 
Manager AQR Capital Management <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;<em>pandas</em> allows us to focus more on research and less on 
programming. We have found<em>pandas</em> easy to learn, easy to use, and easy 
to maintain. The bottom line is that it has increased our productivity.&rdquo;
</p> <br>
</blockquote> <strong>David Himrod</strong>  Director of Optimization 
&amp; Analytics AppNexus <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;<em>pandas</em> is the perfect tool for bridging the gap between 
rapid iterations of ad-hoc analysis and production quality code. If you want 
one tool to be used across a multi-disciplined organization of engineers, 
mathematicians and analysts, look no further.&rdquo;</p> <br>
</blockquote> 
<strong>Olivier Pomel</strong>  CEO Datadog <br>

<blockquote>  &ldquo;We use <em>pandas</em> to process time series data on our 
production servers. The simplicity and elegance of its API, and its high level 
of performance for high-volume datasets, made it a perfect choice for us.&rdquo;
