<p>Reporters wrangle all sorts of data, from analyzing property tax valuations 
to mapping fatal accidents -- and, here at Computerworld, for stories aboutIT 
salaries and H-1B visas. In fact, tools used by data-crunching journalists are 
generally useful for a wide range of other, non-journalistic tasks -- and that 
includes software that's been specifically designed for newsroom use. And, 
given the generally thrifty culture of your average newsroom, these tools often 
have the added appeal of little or no cost.</p> 
<p>I came back from last year's National Institute for Computer-Assisted 
Reporting (NICAR) conference with 22 free tools for data visualization and 
analysis -- most of which are still popular and worth a look. At this year's 
conference, I learned about other free (or at least inexpensive) tools for data 
analysis and presentation.</p> 
<p>Want to see all the tools from last year and 2012?</p> 
<p>For quick reference, check out our chart listing all 30 free data 
visualization and analysis tools.</p> 
<p>Like that previous group of 22 tools, these range from easy enough for a 
beginner (i.e., anyone who can do rudimentary spreadsheet data entry) to expert 
(requiring hands-on coding). Here are eight of the best:</p> 
<p>CSVKit</p> 
<p>What it does: This utility suite from GitHub has a host of Unix-like 
command-line tools for importing, analyzing and reformatting comma-separated 
data files.</p> 
<p>What's cool: Sure, you could pull your file into Excel to examine it, but 
CSVKit makes it quick and easy to preview, slice and summarize.</p> 
<p>For example, you can see all your column headers in a list -- which is 
handy for super-wide, many-column files -- and then just pull data from a few 
of those columns. In addition to inputting CSV files, it can import several 
fixed-width file formats -- for example, there are libraries available for the 
specific fixed-width formats used by the Census Bureau and Federal Elections 
Commission.</p> 
<p>Two simple commands will generate a data structure that can, in turn, be 
used by several SQL database formats (Mr. Data Converter handles only MySQL). 
The SQL code will create a table, inferring the proper data type for each field 
as well as the insert commands for adding data to the table.</p> 
<p>The Unix-like interface will be familiar to anyone who has worked on a *nix 
system, and makes it easy to save multiple frequently used commands in a batch 
file.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: Working on a command line means learning new text commands (not 
to mention the likely risk of typing errors), which might not be worthwhile 
unless you work with CSV files fairly often. Also, be advised that this tool 
suite is written in Python, so Windows users will need that installed on their 
system as well.</p> 
<p>Skill level: Expert</p> 
<p>Runs on: Any Windows, Mac or Linux system with Python installed.</p> 
<p>Learn more: The documentation includes an easy-to-follow tutorial. There's 
also a briefintroductory slide presentation that was given at the NICAR 
conference last month.</p> 
<p>Related tools: Google Refine is a desktop application that can do some 
rudimentary file analysis as well as its core task of data cleaning; andThe R 
Project for Statistical Computing can do more powerful statistical analysis on 
CSV and other files.</p> 
<p>DataTables</p> 
<p>What it does: This popular jQuery plug-in (which was designed and created 
by Allan Jardine) creates sortable, searchable HTML tables from a variety of 
data sources -- say, an existing, static HTML table, a JavaScript array, JSON 
or server-side SQL.</p> 
<p>What's cool: In addition to sortable tables, results can be searched in 
real time (results are narrowed further with each search-entry keystroke).</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: Search capability is fairly basic and cannot be narrowed by 
column or by using wildcard or Boolean searches.</p> 
<p>Skill level: Expert</p> 
<p>Runs on: JavaScript-enabled Web browsers</p> 
<p>Learn more: Numerous examples on the DataTables site show many ways to use 
this plug-in.</p> 
<p>FreeDive</p> 
<p>What it does: This alpha project from the Knight Digital Media Center at UC 
Berkeley turns a Google Docs spreadsheet into an interactive, sortable database 
that can be posted on the Web.</p> 
<p>What's cool: In addition to text searching, you can include numerical 
range-based sliders. Usage is free. End users can easily create their own 
databases from spreadsheets without writing code.</p> 
<p>FreeDive's chief current attraction is the ability to create databases 
without programming; however, freeDive source code will be posted and available 
for use once the project is more mature. That could appeal to IT departments 
seeking a way to offer this type of service in-house, allowing end users to 
turn a Google Doc into a filterable, sortable Web database using the Google 
Visualization API, Google Query Language, JavaScript and jQuery -- without 
needing to manually generate that code.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: My test application ran into some intermittent problems; for 
example, it wouldn't display my data list when using the &quot;show all 
records&quot; button. This is an alpha project, and should be treated as such.
</p> 
<p>In addition, the current iteration limits spreadsheets to 10 columns and a 
single sheet. One column must have numbers, so this won't work for text-only 
information. The search widget is currently limited to a few specific choices 
of fields to search, although this might increase as the project matures. (A 
paid service like Caspio would offer more customization.) The nine-step wizard 
might get cumbersome after frequent use.</p> 
<p>Skill level: Advanced beginner.</p> 
<p>Runs on: Current Web browsers</p> 
<p>Learn more: The freeDive site includes several video tutorials at the 
bottom of the home page as well as test data to try out thewizard.</p> 
<p>Related tools: Caspio is a well-established commercial alternative. For a 
JavaScript alternative with more control over the table created from a Google 
Docs spreadsheet, you might want to investigateTabletop, which makes a Google 
Docs spreadsheet accessible to JavaScript code.</p> 
<p>Highcharts JS</p> 
<p>What it does: This JavaScript library from Highsoft Solutions provides an 
easy way to create professional-looking interactive charts for the Web.JQuery, 
Mootools or Prototype required.</p> 
<p>What's cool: With Highcharts, users can mouse over items for more details; 
they can also click on items in the chart legend to turn them on and off. There 
are many different chart types available, from basic line, bar, column and area 
charts to zoomable time series; each comes with six stylesheet options. Little 
customization is needed to get a sleek-looking chart -- and charts will display 
on iOS and Android devices as well as on desktop browsers.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: Highcharts, like Google Maps, does have a distinctive look, so 
you may want to customize the Highcharts stylesheets so your visualizations 
don't look like numerous other Highcharts on the Web. While charts displayed 
fine for me on an Android phone, they weren't interactive (they were on aniPad).
</p> 
<p>And unlike most JavaScript/jQuery libraries, Highcharts is free only for 
non-commercial use, although a site-wide license for many companies costs only 
$80. (The cost jumps to $300 per developer seat in some cases -- for example, 
if charts are customized for individual users.) Rendering can be slow in some 
older browsers (notably Internet Explorer 6 and 7).</p> 
<p>Skill level: Intermediate to Expert.</p> 
<p>Runs on: Web browsers</p> 
<p>Learn more: The Highcharts demo gallery includes easy-to-view source code; 
thedocumentation explains other options.</p> 
<p>Related tools: Google Chart Tools create static image charts and graphs or 
more interactive JavaScript-based visualizations; there are also JavaScript 
libraries such asProtovis and the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit. Exhibit is an MIT 
Simile Project spinoff designed for presenting data on the Web with filtering, 
sorting and interactive capabilities.</p> 
<p>Mr. Data Converter</p> 
<p>What it does: How often do you have data in one format -- while your 
application needs it in another? New York Times interactive graphics editor 
Shan Carter ran into this situation often enough that he coded a tool that 
converts comma- or tab-delimited data into nine different formats. It's 
available as either a service on theWeb or an open source tool.</p> 
<p>What's cool: Mr. Data Converter can generate XML, JSON, ASP/VBScript or 
basic HTML table formatting as well as arrays in PHP, Python (as a dictionary) 
and Ruby. It will even generate MySQL code to create a table (guessing at field 
formats based on the data) and insert your data. If your data is in an Excel 
spreadsheet, you don't need to save it as a CSV or TSV; you can just copy and 
paste it into the tool.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: Only CSV or TSV formats can be input, as well as copying and 
pasting in data from Excel.</p> 
<p>Skill level: Beginner</p> 
<p>Runs on: JavaScript-enabled Web browsers</p> 
<p>Learn more: You can follow Mr. Data Converter on Twitter at 
@mrdataconverter.</p> 
<p>Related tools: Data Wrangler is a Web-based tool that reformats data to 
your specifications.</p> 
<p>Panda Project</p> 
<p>What it does: Panda is less about analyzing or presenting data than finding 
it amidst the pile of standalone spreadsheets scattered around an organization. 
It was specifically designed for newsrooms, but could be used by any 
organization where individuals collect information on their desktops that would 
be worth sharing. Billed as a &quot;newsroom appliance,&quot; users can upload 
CSV or Excel files to Panda and then search across all available data sets or a 
within a single file.</p> 
<p>What's cool: Panda makes it simple to give others access to information 
that's been sitting on individuals' hard drives in different stand-alone 
spreadsheets. Even non-technical users can easily upload and search data. 
Search is extremely fast, usingApacheSolr.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: Queries are basic -- you can't specify a particular column/field 
to search, so a search for &quot;Washington&quot; would bring back items 
containing both the place and a person's name. The required hosting platform is 
quite specific, requiring Ubuntu 11.1. (Panda's developers have created an 
Amazon Community Image with the required server setup for hosting on Amazon Web 
Services EC2.)</p> 
<p>Skill level: Beginner (Advanced Beginner for administration)</p> 
<p>Runs on: Must be hosted on Amazon EC2 or a server running Ubuntu 11.10. 
Clients can use any Web browser.</p> 
<p>Learn more: Panda documentation, still in the works, gives basics on setup, 
configuration and use. Nieman Journalism Lab has somebackground on the project, 
which was funded by a $150,000 Knight News Challenge grant.</p> 
<p>PowerPivot</p> 
<p>What it does: This free plugin from Microsoft allows Excel 2010 to handle 
massively large data sets much more efficiently than the basic version of Excel 
does. It also lets Excel act like a relational database by adding the capacity 
to truly join columns in different tables instead of relying on Excel's 
somewhat cumbersome VLOOKUP command. PowerPivot includes its own formula 
language, Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), which has a similar syntax to 
Excel's conventional formulas.</p> 
<p>What's cool: PowerPivot can handle millions of records -- data sets that 
would usually grind PowerPivot-less Excel to a halt. And by joining tables, you 
can make more &quot;intelligent&quot; pivot tables and charts to explore and 
visualize large data sets with Excel's point-and-click interface.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: This is limited to Excel 2010 on Windows systems. Also, SQL 
jocks might prefer using a true relational database for multi-table data in 
order to build complex data queries.</p> 
<p>Skill level: Intermediate</p> 
<p>Runs on: Excel 2010 on Windows only.</p> 
<p>Learn more: There are links to demos and videos on the PowerPivot main page
, as well as an introductory tutorial on Microsoft's TechNet.</p> 
<p>Related tools: Zoho Reports can take data from various file formats and 
turn it into charts, tables and pivot tables.</p> 
<p>Weave</p> 
<p>What it does: This general-purpose visualization platform allows creation 
of interactive dashboards with multiple, related visualizations -- for example, 
a bar chart, scatter plot and map. The open-source project was created by the 
University of Massachusetts at Lowell in partnership with a consortium of 
government agencies and is still in beta.</p> 
<p>What's cool: The visualizations are slick and highly interactive; clicking 
an area in one visualization also affects others in the dashboard. The platform 
includes powerful statistical analysis capabilities. Users can create their own 
visualizations on a Weave-based Web system, or save and alter the tools and 
appearances of visualizations that have been publicly shared by others.</p> 
<p>Drawbacks: Requires Flash for end-user viewing. It's currently somewhat 
difficult to install, although a one-click install is scheduled for this 
summer. And because it's so powerful, some users say that implementations must 
consider how to winnow down functionality so as not to overwhelm end users.</p> 
<p>Skill level: Intermediate for those just creating visualizations; Expert 
for those implementing a Weave system.</p> 
<p>Runs on: Flash-enabled browsers. Server requires a Java servlet container 
(Tomcat or Glassfish, MySQL or PostgreSQL, Linux and Adobe Flex 3.6 SDK).</p> 
<p>Learn more: The Weave site includes demos, videos and a user guide. For 
more examples of visualizations that can be built using a Weave platform, see 
one planner's MetroBostonDataCommon gallery. In addition, I wrote more detailed 
Computerworld coverage of Weave following a presentation at Northeastern 
University.</p> 
<p>Related tools: Tableau Public is a robust general-purpose visualization 
platform.</p>
