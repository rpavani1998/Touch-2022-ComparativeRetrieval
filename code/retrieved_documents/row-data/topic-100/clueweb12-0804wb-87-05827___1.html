Open Source Analytics_ Visualization and Predictive 
Modeling of Big Data with the R Programming Language Presentation 1 [PPT] <br>

<p>The economics of data aggregation and analysis are being disrupted by 
falling costs for storage andCPU power, the continuing shift of business 
processes online, and the deluge of data that is being generated as a 
consequence.</p> 
<p>Innovative technologies have emerged to cope with the storage and retrieval 
of Big Data, yet analysis tools have been less emphasized. Many emerging data 
sets do not fit within existing software paradigms: either their size 
overwhelms traditional desktop tools such as Excel, or their range of data 
types (geocodes, for example) prevent them from being pipelined into more 
powerful, but narrowly designed tools. Most importantly, closed-source tools 
cannot keep pace with the leading edge of innovation in statistical and 
machine-learning algorithms.</p> 
<p>Enter the open source programming language R. R has been dubbed the lingua 
franca for statistical computing and graphical analysis, with a pedigree 
tracing back several decades at Bell Labs. Though its million-plus users are 
concentrated within academia, R is gaining currency within several high-profile 
quantitative analysis groups, including Google&rsquo;s Customer Insights team 
and Barclays Global Investors. In addition, R&rsquo;s extensibility via 
user-contributed packages has spawned an active developer community.</p> 
<p>In this session, I will focus on applying R&rsquo;s powerful visualization 
and analysis capabilities to the kinds of large, multidimensional data sets 
that increasingly confront developers. Along the way, I will highlight 
R&rsquo;s functional programming features, its compact syntax for statistical 
modeling, and its ease of connectivity with persistent data stores.</p> 
<p>In particular, I will present the following two case studies applying R to 
large, freely available data sets:</p> 
<p>- an analysis of NASA&rsquo;s Landsat imagery of Brazil&rsquo;s center-west 
agricultural regions to detect correlates for soybean harvest yields, and a 
derived predictor of the Brazilian soybean market based in part on these 
correlates.</p> 
<p>- a validation of Bill James&rsquo; sabermetrics approach to batting 
performance using 30 years of Major League Baseball statistics, and a derived 
predictor for batters&rsquo; salaries.</p> 
<p>For all of its strengths, R has an admittedly steep learning curve. While 
source code for these examples will be provided, this talk will emphasize 
techniques and approach over detail. This session seeks to give developers the 
courage to learn R, the confidence to include it in theirOSS arsenal, and the 
wisdom to recognize opportunities for its use.</p>

<p>There was a bit too much PR fluff plus Tufte advocacy and too little focus 
on what R is and what it can do. There was also little or no practical 
information on the tools that have been built around the language to make it do 
the cool things that Michael talked about.</p> 
<p>There was more time/effort devoted to &ldquo;How to do good 
visualization&rdquo; which could have been summarized to a few book 
recommendations, and too little &ldquo;Here is how to get started munging, 
modeling and visualizing data using the R toolkit&rdquo;.</p>
