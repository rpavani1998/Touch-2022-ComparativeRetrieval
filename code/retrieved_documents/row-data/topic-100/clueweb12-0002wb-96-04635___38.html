<h1>Design and History FAQ&para;</h1> 
<h2>Why does Python use indentation for grouping of statements?&para;</h2> 
<p>Guido van Rossum believes that using indentation for grouping is extremely 
elegant and contributes a lot to the clarity of the average Python program. 
Most people learn to love this feature after a while.</p> 
<p>Since there are no begin/end brackets there cannot be a disagreement 
between grouping perceived by the parser and the human reader. Occasionally C 
programmers will encounter a fragment of code like this:</p> 
<pre>if (x &lt;= y) x++; y--; z++; </pre> 
<p>Only the x++ statement is executed if the condition is true, but the 
indentation leads you to believe otherwise. Even experienced C programmers will 
sometimes stare at it a long time wondering whyy is being decremented even for x
&gt; y.</p> 
<p>Because there are no begin/end brackets, Python is much less prone to 
coding-style conflicts. In C there are many different ways to place the braces. 
If you&rsquo;re used to reading and writing code that uses one style, you will 
feel at least slightly uneasy when reading (or being required to write) another 
style.</p> 
<p>Many coding styles place begin/end brackets on a line by themselves. This 
makes programs considerably longer and wastes valuable screen space, making it 
harder to get a good overview of a program. Ideally, a function should fit on 
one screen (say, 20-30 lines). 20 lines of Python can do a lot more work than 
20 lines of C. This is not solely due to the lack of begin/end brackets &ndash; 
the lack of declarations and the high-level data types are also responsible 
&ndash; but the indentation-based syntax certainly helps.</p> 
<h2>Why am I getting strange results with simple arithmetic operations?&para;
</h2> 
<p>See the next question.</p> 
<h2>Why are floating point calculations so inaccurate?&para;</h2> 
<p>People are often very surprised by results like this:</p> 
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.2 - 1.0 0.199999999999999996 </pre> 
<p>and think it is a bug in Python. It&rsquo;s not. This has nothing to do 
with Python, but with how the underlying C platform handles floating point 
numbers, and ultimately with the inaccuracies introduced when writing down 
numbers as a string of a fixed number of digits.</p> 
<p>The internal representation of floating point numbers uses a fixed number 
of binary digits to represent a decimal number. Some decimal numbers 
can&rsquo;t be represented exactly in binary, resulting in small roundoff 
errors.</p> 
<p>In decimal math, there are many numbers that can&rsquo;t be represented 
with a fixed number of decimal digits, e.g. 1/3 = 0.3333333333.......</p> 
<p>In base 2, 1/2 = 0.1, 1/4 = 0.01, 1/8 = 0.001, etc. .2 equals 2/10 equals 
1/5, resulting in the binary fractional number 0.001100110011001...</p> 
<p>Floating point numbers only have 32 or 64 bits of precision, so the digits 
are cut off at some point, and the resulting number is 0.199999999999999996 in 
decimal, not 0.2.</p> 
<p>A floating point number&rsquo;s repr() function prints as many digits are 
necessary to makeeval(repr(f)) == f true for any float f. The str() function 
prints fewer digits and this often results in the more sensible number that was 
probably intended:</p> 
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.1 - 0.9 0.20000000000000007 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(1.1 - 0.9) 
0.2 </pre> 
<p>One of the consequences of this is that it is error-prone to compare the 
result of some computation to a float with==. Tiny inaccuracies may mean that ==
 fails. Instead, you have to check that the difference between the two numbers 
is less than a certain threshold:</p> 
<pre>epsilon = 0.0000000000001 # Tiny allowed error expected_result = 0.4 if 
expected_result-epsilon &lt;= computation() &lt;= expected_result+epsilon: ... 
</pre> 
<p>Please see the chapter on <em>floating point arithmetic</em> in the Python 
tutorial for more information.</p> 
<h2>Why are Python strings immutable?&para;</h2> 
<p>There are several advantages.</p> 
<p>One is performance: knowing that a string is immutable means we can 
allocate space for it at creation time, and the storage requirements are fixed 
and unchanging. This is also one of the reasons for the distinction between 
tuples and lists.</p> 
<p>Another advantage is that strings in Python are considered as 
&ldquo;elemental&rdquo; as numbers. No amount of activity will change the value 
8 to anything else, and in Python, no amount of activity will change the string 
&ldquo;eight&rdquo; to anything else.</p> 
<h2>Why must &lsquo;self&rsquo; be used explicitly in method definitions and 
calls?&para;</h2> 
<p>The idea was borrowed from Modula-3. It turns out to be very useful, for a 
variety of reasons.</p> 
<p>First, it&rsquo;s more obvious that you are using a method or instance 
attribute instead of a local variable. Readingself.x or self.meth() makes it 
absolutely clear that an instance variable or method is used even if you 
don&rsquo;t know the class definition by heart. In C++, you can sort of tell by 
the lack of a local variable declaration (assuming globals are rare or easily 
recognizable) &ndash; but in Python, there are no local variable declarations, 
so you&rsquo;d have to look up the class definition to be sure. Some C++ and 
Java coding standards call for instance attributes to have anm_ prefix, so this 
explicitness is still useful in those languages, too.</p> 
<p>Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to 
explicitly reference or call the method from a particular class. In C++, if you 
want to use a method from a base class which is overridden in a derived class, 
you have to use the:: operator &ndash; in Python you can write 
baseclass.methodname(self, &lt;argument list&gt;). This is particularly useful 
for__init__() methods, and in general in cases where a derived class method 
wants to extend the base class method of the same name and thus has to call the 
base class method somehow.</p> 
<p>Finally, for instance variables it solves a syntactic problem with 
assignment: since local variables in Python are (by definition!) those 
variables to which a value is assigned in a function body (and that 
aren&rsquo;t explicitly declared global), there has to be some way to tell the 
interpreter that an assignment was meant to assign to an instance variable 
instead of to a local variable, and it should preferably be syntactic (for 
efficiency reasons). C++ does this through declarations, but Python 
doesn&rsquo;t have declarations and it would be a pity having to introduce them 
just for this purpose. Using the explicitself.var solves this nicely. 
Similarly, for using instance variables, having to writeself.var means that 
references to unqualified names inside a method don&rsquo;t have to search the 
instance&rsquo;s directories. To put it another way, local variables and 
instance variables live in two different namespaces, and you need to tell 
Python which namespace to use.</p> 
<h2>Why can&rsquo;t I use an assignment in an expression?&para;</h2> 
<p>Many people used to C or Perl complain that they want to use this C idiom:
</p> 
<pre>while (line = readline(f)) { // do something with line } </pre> 
<p>where in Python you&rsquo;re forced to write this:</p> 
<pre>while True: line = f.readline() if not line: break ... # do something 
with line </pre> 
<p>The reason for not allowing assignment in Python expressions is a common, 
hard-to-find bug in those other languages, caused by this construct:</p> 
<pre>if (x = 0) { // error handling } else { // code that only works for 
nonzero x } </pre> 
<p>The error is a simple typo: x = 0, which assigns 0 to the variable x, was 
written while the comparisonx == 0 is certainly what was intended.</p> 
<p>Many alternatives have been proposed. Most are hacks that save some typing 
but use arbitrary or cryptic syntax or keywords, and fail the simple criterion 
for language change proposals: it should intuitively suggest the proper meaning 
to a human reader who has not yet been introduced to the construct.</p> 
<p>An interesting phenomenon is that most experienced Python programmers 
recognize thewhile True idiom and don&rsquo;t seem to be missing the assignment 
in expression construct much; it&rsquo;s only newcomers who express a strong 
desire to add this to the language.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s an alternative way of spelling this that seems attractive but 
is generally less robust than the &ldquo;while True&rdquo; solution:</p> 
<pre>line = f.readline() while line: ... # do something with line... line = f.
readline() </pre> 
<p>The problem with this is that if you change your mind about exactly how you 
get the next line (e.g. you want to change it intosys.stdin.readline()) you 
have to remember to change two places in your program &ndash; the second 
occurrence is hidden at the bottom of the loop.</p> 
<p>The best approach is to use iterators, making it possible to loop through 
objects using thefor statement. For example, <em>file objects</em> support the 
iterator protocol, so you can write simply:</p> 
<pre>for line in f: ... # do something with line... </pre> 
<h2>Why does Python use methods for some functionality (e.g. list.index()) but 
functions for other (e.g. len(list))?&para;</h2> 
<p>The major reason is history. Functions were used for those operations that 
were generic for a group of types and which were intended to work even for 
objects that didn&rsquo;t have methods at all (e.g. tuples). It is also 
convenient to have a function that can readily be applied to an amorphous 
collection of objects when you use the functional features of Python (map(), 
apply() et al).</p> 
<p>In fact, implementing len(), max(), min() as a built-in function is 
actually less code than implementing them as methods for each type. One can 
quibble about individual cases but it&rsquo;s a part of Python, and it&rsquo;s 
too late to make such fundamental changes now. The functions have to remain to 
avoid massive code breakage.</p> 
<p>Note</p> 
<p>For string operations, Python has moved from external functions (the string 
module) to methods. However,len() is still a function.</p> 
<h2>Why is join() a string method instead of a list or tuple method?&para;</h2>
<p>Strings became much more like other standard types starting in Python 1.6, 
when methods were added which give the same functionality that has always been 
available using the functions of the string module. Most of these new methods 
have been widely accepted, but the one which appears to make some programmers 
feel uncomfortable is:</p> 
<pre>&quot;, &quot;.join(['1', '2', '4', '8', '16']) </pre> 
<p>which gives the result:</p> 
<pre>&quot;1, 2, 4, 8, 16&quot; </pre> 
<p>There are two common arguments against this usage.</p> 
<p>The first runs along the lines of: &ldquo;It looks really ugly using a 
method of a string literal (string constant)&rdquo;, to which the answer is 
that it might, but a string literal is just a fixed value. If the methods are 
to be allowed on names bound to strings there is no logical reason to make them 
unavailable on literals.</p> 
<p>The second objection is typically cast as: &ldquo;I am really telling a 
sequence to join its members together with a string constant&rdquo;. Sadly, you 
aren&rsquo;t. For some reason there seems to be much less difficulty with having
split() as a string method, since in that case it is easy to see that</p> 
<pre>&quot;1, 2, 4, 8, 16&quot;.split(&quot;, &quot;) </pre> 
<p>is an instruction to a string literal to return the substrings delimited by 
the given separator (or, by default, arbitrary runs of white space).</p> 
<p>join() is a string method because in using it you are telling the separator 
string to iterate over a sequence of strings and insert itself between adjacent 
elements. This method can be used with any argument which obeys the rules for 
sequence objects, including any new classes you might define yourself. Similar 
methods exist for bytes and bytearray objects.</p> 
<h2>How fast are exceptions?&para;</h2> 
<p>A try/except block is extremely efficient. Actually catching an exception 
is expensive. In versions of Python prior to 2.0 it was common to use this 
idiom:</p> 
<pre>try: value = mydict[key] except KeyError: mydict[key] = getvalue(key) 
value = mydict[key] </pre> 
<p>This only made sense when you expected the dict to have the key almost all 
the time. If that wasn&rsquo;t the case, you coded it like this:</p> 
<pre>if mydict.has_key(key): value = mydict[key] else: mydict[key] = getvalue(
key) value = mydict[key] </pre> 
<p>For this specific case, you could also use value = dict.setdefault(key, 
getvalue(key)), but only if the getvalue() call is cheap enough because it is 
evaluated in all cases.</p> 
<h2>Why isn&rsquo;t there a switch or case statement in Python?&para;</h2> 
<p>You can do this easily enough with a sequence of if... elif... elif... else
. There have been some proposals for switch statement syntax, but there is no 
consensus (yet) on whether and how to do range tests. See<strong>PEP 275
</strong> for complete details and the current status.</p> 
<p>For cases where you need to choose from a very large number of 
possibilities, you can create a dictionary mapping case values to functions to 
call. For example:</p> 
<pre>def function_1(...): ... functions = {'a': function_1, 'b': function_2, 
'c': self.method_1, ...} func = functions[value] func() </pre> 
<p>For calling methods on objects, you can simplify yet further by using the 
getattr() built-in to retrieve methods with a particular name:</p> 
<pre>def visit_a(self, ...): ... ... def dispatch(self, value): method_name = 
'visit_' + str(value) method = getattr(self, method_name) method() </pre> 
<p>It&rsquo;s suggested that you use a prefix for the method names, such as 
visit_ in this example. Without such a prefix, if values are coming from an 
untrusted source, an attacker would be able to call any method on your object.
</p> 
<h2>Can&rsquo;t you emulate threads in the interpreter instead of relying on 
an OS-specific thread implementation?&para;</h2> 
<p>Answer 1: Unfortunately, the interpreter pushes at least one C stack frame 
for each Python stack frame. Also, extensions can call back into Python at 
almost random moments. Therefore, a complete threads implementation requires 
thread support for C.</p> 
<p>Answer 2: Fortunately, there is Stackless Python, which has a completely 
redesigned interpreter loop that avoids the C stack. It&rsquo;s still 
experimental but looks very promising. Although it is binary compatible with 
standard Python, it&rsquo;s still unclear whether Stackless will make it into 
the core &ndash; maybe it&rsquo;s just too revolutionary.</p> 
<h2>Why can&rsquo;t lambda forms contain statements?&para;</h2> 
<p>Python lambda forms cannot contain statements because Python&rsquo;s 
syntactic framework can&rsquo;t handle statements nested inside expressions. 
However, in Python, this is not a serious problem. Unlike lambda forms in other 
languages, where they add functionality, Python lambdas are only a shorthand 
notation if you&rsquo;re too lazy to define a function.</p> 
<p>Functions are already first class objects in Python, and can be declared in 
a local scope. Therefore the only advantage of using a lambda form instead of a 
locally-defined function is that you don&rsquo;t need to invent a name for the 
function &ndash; but that&rsquo;s just a local variable to which the function 
object (which is exactly the same type of object that a lambda form yields) is 
assigned!</p> 
<h2>Can Python be compiled to machine code, C or some other language?&para;
</h2> 
<p>Not easily. Python&rsquo;s high level data types, dynamic typing of objects 
and run-time invocation of the interpreter (usingeval() or exec()) together 
mean that a &ldquo;compiled&rdquo; Python program would probably consist mostly 
of calls into the Python run-time system, even for seemingly simple operations 
likex+1.</p> 
<p>Several projects described in the Python newsgroup or at past Python 
conferences have shown that this approach is feasible, although the speedups 
reached so far are only modest (e.g. 2x). Jython uses the same strategy for 
compiling to Java bytecode. (Jim Hugunin has demonstrated that in combination 
with whole-program analysis, speedups of 1000x are feasible for small demo 
programs. See the proceedings from the1997 Python conference for more 
information.)</p> 
<p>Internally, Python source code is always translated into a bytecode 
representation, and this bytecode is then executed by the Python virtual 
machine. In order to avoid the overhead of repeatedly parsing and translating 
modules that rarely change, this byte code is written into a file whose name 
ends in &rdquo;.pyc&rdquo; whenever a module is parsed. When the corresponding 
.py file is changed, it is parsed and translated again and the .pyc file is 
rewritten.</p> 
<p>There is no performance difference once the .pyc file has been loaded, as 
the bytecode read from the .pyc file is exactly the same as the bytecode 
created by direct translation. The only difference is that loading code from a 
.pyc file is faster than parsing and translating a .py file, so the presence of 
precompiled .pyc files improves the start-up time of Python scripts. If 
desired, the Lib/compileall.py module can be used to create valid .pyc files 
for a given set of modules.</p> 
<p>Note that the main script executed by Python, even if its filename ends in 
.py, is not compiled to a .pyc file. It is compiled to bytecode, but the 
bytecode is not saved to a file. Usually main scripts are quite short, so this 
doesn&rsquo;t cost much speed.</p> 
<p>There are also several programs which make it easier to intermingle Python 
and C code in various ways to increase performance. See, for example,Cython, 
Pyrex and Weave.</p> 
<h2>How does Python manage memory?&para;</h2> 
<p>The details of Python memory management depend on the implementation. The 
standard C implementation of Python uses reference counting to detect 
inaccessible objects, and another mechanism to collect reference cycles, 
periodically executing a cycle detection algorithm which looks for inaccessible 
cycles and deletes the objects involved. Thegc module provides functions to 
perform a garbage collection, obtain debugging statistics, and tune the 
collector&rsquo;s parameters.</p> 
<p>Jython relies on the Java runtime so the JVM&rsquo;s garbage collector is 
used. This difference can cause some subtle porting problems if your Python 
code depends on the behavior of the reference counting implementation.</p> 
<p>In the absence of circularities, Python programs do not need to manage 
memory explicitly.</p> 
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Python use a more traditional garbage collection scheme? 
For one thing, this is not a C standard feature and hence it&rsquo;s not 
portable. (Yes, we know about the Boehm GC library. It has bits of assembler 
code for<em>most</em> common platforms, not for all of them, and although it is 
mostly transparent, it isn&rsquo;t completely transparent; patches are required 
to get Python to work with it.)</p> 
<p>Traditional GC also becomes a problem when Python is embedded into other 
applications. While in a standalone Python it&rsquo;s fine to replace the 
standard malloc() and free() with versions provided by the GC library, an 
application embedding Python may want to have its<em>own</em> substitute for 
malloc() and free(), and may not want Python&rsquo;s. Right now, Python works 
with anything that implements malloc() and free() properly.</p> 
<p>In Jython, the following code (which is fine in CPython) will probably run 
out of file descriptors long before it runs out of memory:</p> 
<pre>for file in very_long_list_of_files: f = open(file) c = f.read(1) </pre> 
<p>Using the current reference counting and destructor scheme, each new 
assignment to f closes the previous file. Using GC, this is not guaranteed. If 
you want to write code that will work with any Python implementation, you 
should explicitly close the file or use thewith statement; this will work 
regardless of GC:</p> 
<pre>for file in very_long_list_of_files: with open(file) as f: c = f.read(1) 
</pre> 
<h2>Why isn&rsquo;t all memory freed when Python exits?&para;</h2> 
<p>Objects referenced from the global namespaces of Python modules are not 
always deallocated when Python exits. This may happen if there are circular 
references. There are also certain bits of memory that are allocated by the C 
library that are impossible to free (e.g. a tool like Purify will complain 
about these). Python is, however, aggressive about cleaning up memory on exit 
and does try to destroy every single object.</p> 
<p>If you want to force Python to delete certain things on deallocation use the
atexit module to run a function that will force those deletions.</p> 
<h2>Why are there separate tuple and list data types?&para;</h2> 
<p>Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in 
fundamentally different ways. Tuples can be thought of as being similar to 
Pascal records or C structs; they&rsquo;re small collections of related data 
which may be of different types which are operated on as a group. For example, 
a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three 
numbers.</p> 
<p>Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They 
tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and 
which are operated on one-by-one. For example,os.listdir('.') returns a list of 
strings representing the files in the current directory. Functions which 
operate on this output would generally not break if you added another file or 
two to the directory.</p> 
<p>Tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple has been created, you 
can&rsquo;t replace any of its elements with a new value. Lists are mutable, 
meaning that you can always change a list&rsquo;s elements. Only immutable 
elements can be used as dictionary keys, and hence only tuples and not lists 
can be used as keys.</p> 
<h2>How are lists implemented?&para;</h2> 
<p>Python&rsquo;s lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style 
linked lists. The implementation uses a contiguous array of references to other 
objects, and keeps a pointer to this array and the array&rsquo;s length in a 
list head structure.</p> 
<p>This makes indexing a list a[i] an operation whose cost is independent of 
the size of the list or the value of the index.</p> 
<p>When items are appended or inserted, the array of references is resized. 
Some cleverness is applied to improve the performance of appending items 
repeatedly; when the array must be grown, some extra space is allocated so the 
next few times don&rsquo;t require an actual resize.</p> 
<h2>How are dictionaries implemented?&para;</h2> 
<p>Python&rsquo;s dictionaries are implemented as resizable hash tables. 
Compared to B-trees, this gives better performance for lookup (the most common 
operation by far) under most circumstances, and the implementation is simpler.
</p> 
<p>Dictionaries work by computing a hash code for each key stored in the 
dictionary using thehash() built-in function. The hash code varies widely 
depending on the key; for example, &ldquo;Python&rdquo; hashes to -539294296 
while &ldquo;python&rdquo;, a string that differs by a single bit, hashes to 
1142331976. The hash code is then used to calculate a location in an internal 
array where the value will be stored. Assuming that you&rsquo;re storing keys 
that all have different hash values, this means that dictionaries take constant 
time &ndash; O(1), in computer science notation &ndash; to retrieve a key. It 
also means that no sorted order of the keys is maintained, and traversing the 
array as the.keys() and .items() do will output the dictionary&rsquo;s content 
in some arbitrary jumbled order.</p> 
<h2>Why must dictionary keys be immutable?&para;</h2> 
<p>The hash table implementation of dictionaries uses a hash value calculated 
from the key value to find the key. If the key were a mutable object, its value 
could change, and thus its hash could also change. But since whoever changes 
the key object can&rsquo;t tell that it was being used as a dictionary key, it 
can&rsquo;t move the entry around in the dictionary. Then, when you try to look 
up the same object in the dictionary it won&rsquo;t be found because its hash 
value is different. If you tried to look up the old value it wouldn&rsquo;t be 
found either, because the value of the object found in that hash bin would be 
different.</p> 
<p>If you want a dictionary indexed with a list, simply convert the list to a 
tuple first; the functiontuple(L) creates a tuple with the same entries as the 
listL. Tuples are immutable and can therefore be used as dictionary keys.</p> 
<p>Some unacceptable solutions that have been proposed:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>Hash lists by their address (object ID). This doesn&rsquo;t work because if 
you construct a new list with the same value it won&rsquo;t be found; e.g.:</p> 
<pre>mydict = {[1, 2]: '12'} print(mydict[[1, 2]]) </pre> 
<p>would raise a KeyError exception because the id of the [1, 2] used in the 
second line differs from that in the first line. In other words, dictionary 
keys should be compared using==, not using is.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Make a copy when using a list as a key. This doesn&rsquo;t work because the 
list, being a mutable object, could contain a reference to itself, and then the 
copying code would run into an infinite loop.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Allow lists as keys but tell the user not to modify them. This would allow 
a class of hard-to-track bugs in programs when you forgot or modified a list by 
accident. It also invalidates an important invariant of dictionaries: every 
value ind.keys() is usable as a key of the dictionary.</p> </li> 
<li>
<p>Mark lists as read-only once they are used as a dictionary key. The problem 
is that it&rsquo;s not just the top-level object that could change its value; 
you could use a tuple containing a list as a key. Entering anything as a key 
into a dictionary would require marking all objects reachable from there as 
read-only &ndash; and again, self-referential objects could cause an infinite 
loop.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p>There is a trick to get around this if you need to, but use it at your own 
risk: You can wrap a mutable structure inside a class instance which has both a
__eq__() and a __hash__() method. You must then make sure that the hash value 
for all such wrapper objects that reside in a dictionary (or other hash based 
structure), remain fixed while the object is in the dictionary (or other 
structure).</p> 
<pre>class ListWrapper: def __init__(self, the_list): self.the_list = the_list 
def __eq__(self, other): return self.the_list == other.the_list def __hash__(
self): l = self.the_list result = 98767 - len(l)*555 for i, el in enumerate(l): 
try: result = result + (hash(el) % 9999999) * 1001 + i except Exception: result 
= (result % 7777777) + i * 333 return result </pre> 
<p>Note that the hash computation is complicated by the possibility that some 
members of the list may be unhashable and also by the possibility of arithmetic 
overflow.</p> 
<p>Furthermore it must always be the case that if o1 == o2 (ie o1.__eq__(o2) is
True) then hash(o1) == hash(o2) (ie, o1.__hash__() == o2.__hash__()), 
regardless of whether the object is in a dictionary or not. If you fail to meet 
these restrictions dictionaries and other hash based structures will misbehave.
</p> 
<p>In the case of ListWrapper, whenever the wrapper object is in a dictionary 
the wrapped list must not change to avoid anomalies. Don&rsquo;t do this unless 
you are prepared to think hard about the requirements and the consequences of 
not meeting them correctly. Consider yourself warned.</p> 
<h2>Why doesn&rsquo;t list.sort() return the sorted list?&para;</h2> 
<p>In situations where performance matters, making a copy of the list just to 
sort it would be wasteful. Therefore,list.sort() sorts the list in place. In 
order to remind you of that fact, it does not return the sorted list. This way, 
you won&rsquo;t be fooled into accidentally overwriting a list when you need a 
sorted copy but also need to keep the unsorted version around.</p> 
<p>In Python 2.4 a new built-in function &ndash; sorted() &ndash; has been 
added. This function creates a new list from a provided iterable, sorts it and 
returns it. For example, here&rsquo;s how to iterate over the keys of a 
dictionary in sorted order:</p> 
<pre>for key in sorted(mydict): ... # do whatever with mydict[key]... </pre> 
<h2>How do you specify and enforce an interface spec in Python?&para;</h2> 
<p>An interface specification for a module as provided by languages such as 
C++ and Java describes the prototypes for the methods and functions of the 
module. Many feel that compile-time enforcement of interface specifications 
helps in the construction of large programs.</p> 
<p>Python 2.6 adds an abc module that lets you define Abstract Base Classes 
(ABCs). You can then useisinstance() and issubclass() to check whether an 
instance or a class implements a particular ABC. Thecollections modules defines 
a set of useful ABCs such asIterable, Container, and MutableMapping.</p> 
<p>For Python, many of the advantages of interface specifications can be 
obtained by an appropriate test discipline for components. There is also a 
tool, PyChecker, which can be used to find problems due to subclassing.</p> 
<p>A good test suite for a module can both provide a regression test and serve 
as a module interface specification and a set of examples. Many Python modules 
can be run as a script to provide a simple &ldquo;self test.&rdquo; Even 
modules which use complex external interfaces can often be tested in isolation 
using trivial &ldquo;stub&rdquo; emulations of the external interface. The
doctest and unittest modules or third-party test frameworks can be used to 
construct exhaustive test suites that exercise every line of code in a module.
</p> 
<p>An appropriate testing discipline can help build large complex applications 
in Python as well as having interface specifications would. In fact, it can be 
better because an interface specification cannot test certain properties of a 
program. For example, theappend() method is expected to add new elements to the 
end of some internal list; an interface specification cannot test that your
append() implementation will actually do this correctly, but it&rsquo;s trivial 
to check this property in a test suite.</p> 
<p>Writing test suites is very helpful, and you might want to design your code 
with an eye to making it easily tested. One increasingly popular technique, 
test-directed development, calls for writing parts of the test suite first, 
before you write any of the actual code. Of course Python allows you to be 
sloppy and not write test cases at all.</p> 
<h2>Why are default values shared between objects?&para;</h2> 
<p>This type of bug commonly bites neophyte programmers. Consider this 
function:</p> 
<pre>def foo(mydict={}): # Danger: shared reference to one dict for all calls 
... compute something ... mydict[key] = value return mydict </pre> 
<p>The first time you call this function, mydict contains a single item. The 
second time,mydict contains two items because when foo() begins executing, 
mydict starts out with an item already in it.</p> 
<p>It is often expected that a function call creates new objects for default 
values. This is not what happens. Default values are created exactly once, when 
the function is defined. If that object is changed, like the dictionary in this 
example, subsequent calls to the function will refer to this changed object.</p>
<p>By definition, immutable objects such as numbers, strings, tuples, and None
, are safe from change. Changes to mutable objects such as dictionaries, lists, 
and class instances can lead to confusion.</p> 
<p>Because of this feature, it is good programming practice to not use mutable 
objects as default values. Instead, useNone as the default value and inside the 
function, check if the parameter isNone and create a new 
list/dictionary/whatever if it is. For example, don&rsquo;t write:</p> 
<pre>def foo(mydict={}): ... </pre> 
<p>but:</p> 
<pre>def foo(mydict=None): if mydict is None: mydict = {} # create a new dict 
for local namespace </pre> 
<p>This feature can be useful. When you have a function that&rsquo;s 
time-consuming to compute, a common technique is to cache the parameters and 
the resulting value of each call to the function, and return the cached value 
if the same value is requested again. This is called &ldquo;memoizing&rdquo;, 
and can be implemented like this:</p> 
<pre># Callers will never provide a third parameter for this function. def 
expensive (arg1, arg2, _cache={}): if (arg1, arg2) in _cache: return _cache[(
arg1, arg2)] # Calculate the value result = ... expensive computation ... _cache
[(arg1, arg2)] = result # Store result in the cache return result </pre> 
<p>You could use a global variable containing a dictionary instead of the 
default value; it&rsquo;s a matter of taste.</p> 
<h2>Why is there no goto?&para;</h2> 
<p>You can use exceptions to provide a &ldquo;structured goto&rdquo; that even 
works across function calls. Many feel that exceptions can conveniently emulate 
all reasonable uses of the &ldquo;go&rdquo; or &ldquo;goto&rdquo; constructs of 
C, Fortran, and other languages. For example:</p> 
<pre>class label: pass # declare a label try: ... if (condition): raise label()
# goto label ... except label: # where to goto pass ... </pre> 
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t allow you to jump into the middle of a loop, but 
that&rsquo;s usually considered an abuse of goto anyway. Use sparingly.</p> 
<h2>Why can&rsquo;t raw strings (r-strings) end with a backslash?&para;</h2> 
<p>More precisely, they can&rsquo;t end with an odd number of backslashes: the 
unpaired backslash at the end escapes the closing quote character, leaving an 
unterminated string.</p> 
<p>Raw strings were designed to ease creating input for processors (chiefly 
regular expression engines) that want to do their own backslash escape 
processing. Such processors consider an unmatched trailing backslash to be an 
error anyway, so raw strings disallow that. In return, they allow you to pass 
on the string quote character by escaping it with a backslash. These rules work 
well when r-strings are used for their intended purpose.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to build Windows pathnames, note that all Windows 
system calls accept forward slashes too:</p> 
<pre>f = open(&quot;/mydir/file.txt&quot;) # works fine! </pre> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to build a pathname for a DOS command, try e.g. one 
of</p> 
<pre>dir = r&quot;\this\is\my\dos\dir&quot; &quot;\\&quot; dir = 
r&quot;\this\is\my\dos\dir\ &quot;[:-1] dir = &quot;\\this\\is\\my\\dos\\dir\\
&quot; </pre> 
<h2>Why doesn&rsquo;t Python have a &ldquo;with&rdquo; statement for attribute 
assignments?&para;</h2> 
<p>Python has a &lsquo;with&rsquo; statement that wraps the execution of a 
block, calling code on the entrance and exit from the block. Some language have 
a construct that looks like this:</p> 
<pre>with obj: a = 1 # equivalent to obj.a = 1 total = total + 1 # obj.total = 
obj.total + 1 </pre> 
<p>In Python, such a construct would be ambiguous.</p> 
<p>Other languages, such as Object Pascal, Delphi, and C++, use static types, 
so it&rsquo;s possible to know, in an unambiguous way, what member is being 
assigned to. This is the main point of static typing &ndash; the compiler<em>
always</em> knows the scope of every variable at compile time.</p> 
<p>Python uses dynamic types. It is impossible to know in advance which 
attribute will be referenced at runtime. Member attributes may be added or 
removed from objects on the fly. This makes it impossible to know, from a 
simple reading, what attribute is being referenced: a local one, a global one, 
or a member attribute?</p> 
<p>For instance, take the following incomplete snippet:</p> 
<pre>def foo(a): with a: print(x) </pre> 
<p>The snippet assumes that &ldquo;a&rdquo; must have a member attribute 
called &ldquo;x&rdquo;. However, there is nothing in Python that tells the 
interpreter this. What should happen if &ldquo;a&rdquo; is, let us say, an 
integer? If there is a global variable named &ldquo;x&rdquo;, will it be used 
inside the with block? As you see, the dynamic nature of Python makes such 
choices much harder.</p> 
<p>The primary benefit of &ldquo;with&rdquo; and similar language features 
(reduction of code volume) can, however, easily be achieved in Python by 
assignment. Instead of:</p> 
<pre>function(args).mydict[index][index].a = 21 function(args).mydict[index][
index].b = 42 function(args).mydict[index][index].c = 63 </pre> 
<p>write this:</p> 
<pre>ref = function(args).mydict[index][index] ref.a = 21 ref.b = 42 ref.c = 63
</pre> 
<p>This also has the side-effect of increasing execution speed because name 
bindings are resolved at run-time in Python, and the second version only needs 
to perform the resolution once.</p> 
<h2>Why are colons required for the if/while/def/class statements?&para;</h2> 
<p>The colon is required primarily to enhance readability (one of the results 
of the experimental ABC language). Consider this:</p> 
<pre>if a == b print(a) </pre> 
<p>versus</p> 
<pre>if a == b: print(a) </pre> 
<p>Notice how the second one is slightly easier to read. Notice further how a 
colon sets off the example in this FAQ answer; it&rsquo;s a standard usage in 
English.</p> 
<p>Another minor reason is that the colon makes it easier for editors with 
syntax highlighting; they can look for colons to decide when indentation needs 
to be increased instead of having to do a more elaborate parsing of the program 
text.</p> 
<h2>Why does Python allow commas at the end of lists and tuples?&para;</h2> 
<p>Python lets you add a trailing comma at the end of lists, tuples, and 
dictionaries:</p> 
<pre>[1, 2, 3,] ('a', 'b', 'c',) d = { &quot;A&quot;: [1, 5], &quot;B&quot;: [6
, 7], # last trailing comma is optional but good style } </pre> 
<p>There are several reasons to allow this.</p> 
<p>When you have a literal value for a list, tuple, or dictionary spread 
across multiple lines, it&rsquo;s easier to add more elements because you 
don&rsquo;t have to remember to add a comma to the previous line. The lines can 
also be sorted in your editor without creating a syntax error.</p> 
<p>Accidentally omitting the comma can lead to errors that are hard to 
diagnose. For example:</p> 
<pre>x = [ &quot;fee&quot;, &quot;fie&quot; &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;fum&quot; ] 
</pre> 
<p>This list looks like it has four elements, but it actually contains three: 
&ldquo;fee&rdquo;, &ldquo;fiefoo&rdquo; and &ldquo;fum&rdquo;. Always adding 
the comma avoids this source of error.</p> 
<p>Allowing the trailing comma may also make programmatic code generation 
easier.</p>
