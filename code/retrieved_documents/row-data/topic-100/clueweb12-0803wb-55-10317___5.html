<p><b>Praise for <i>Core Python Programming</i></b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;The long-awaited second edition of Wesley Chun's <i>Core Python 
Programming</i> proves to be well worth the wait&mdash;its deep and broad 
coverage and useful exercises will help readers learn and practice good 
Python.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Alex Martelli, author of <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> and editor of 
<i>Python Cookbook</i></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;There has been lot of good buzz around Wesley Chun's <i>Core Python 
Programming</i>. It turns out that all the buzz is well earned. I think this is 
the best book currently available for learning Python. I would recommend Chun's 
book over<i>Learning Python</i> (O'Reilly), <i>Programming Python</i> 
(O'Reilly), or<i>The Quick Python Book</i> (Manning).&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;David Mertz, Ph.D., IBM DeveloperWorks&reg;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;I have been doing a lot of research [on] Python for the past year and 
have seen a number of positive reviews of your book. The sentiment expressed 
confirms the opinion that<i>Core Python Programming</i> is now considered the 
standard introductory text.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Richard Ozaki, Lockheed Martin</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Finally, a book good enough to be both a textbook and a reference on 
the Python language now exists.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Michael Baxter, <i>Linux Journal</i></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come 
across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does 
not presume a large amount of other experience. It does go into some important 
Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never 
condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games. 
[It] sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;http://python.org bookstore Web site</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;[If ] I could only own one Python book, it would be <i>Core Python 
Programming</i> by Wesley Chun. This book manages to cover more topics in more 
depth than Learning Python but includes it all in one book that also more than 
adequately covers the core language. [If] you are in the market for just one 
book about Python, I recommend this book. You will enjoy reading it, including 
its wry programmer's wit. More importantly, you will learn Python. Even more 
importantly, you will find it invaluable in helping you in your day-to-day 
Python programming life. Well done, Mr. Chun!&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Ron Stephens, Python Learning Foundation</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;I think the best language for beginners is Python, without a doubt. 
My favorite book is<i>Core Python Programming</i>.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;s003apr, MP3Car.com Forums</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Personally, I really like Python. It's simple to learn, completely 
intuitive, amazingly flexible, and pretty darned fast. Python has only just 
started to claim mindshare in the Windows world, but look for it to start 
gaining lots of support as people discover it. To learn Python, I'd start with
<i>Core Python Programming</i> by Wesley Chun.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Bill Boswell, MCSE, Microsoft Certified Professional Magazine Online
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;If you learn well from books, I suggest <i>Core Python Programming</i>
. It is by far the best I've found. I'm a Python newbie as well and in three 
months time I've been able to implement Python in projects at work (automating 
MSOffice, SQL DB stuff, etc.).&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;ptonman, Dev Shed Forums</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Python is simply a beautiful language. It's easy to learn, it's 
cross-platform, and it works. It has achieved many of the technical goals that 
Java strives for. A one-sentence description of Python would be: 'All other 
languages appear to have evolved over time--but Python was designed.' And it 
was designed well. Unfortunately, there aren't a large number of books for 
Python. The best one I've run across so far is<i>Core Python Programming</i>
.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Chris Timmons, C. R. Timmons Consulting</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;If you like the Prentice Hall Core series, another good full-blown 
treatment to consider would be<i>Core Python Programming</i>. It addresses in 
elaborate concrete detail many practical topics that get little, if any, 
coverage in other books.&quot;</p> 
<p>&mdash;Mitchell L Model, MLM Consulting</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;<i>Core Python Programming</i> is an amazingly easy read! The liberal 
use of examples helps clarify some of the more subtle points of the language. 
And the comparisons to languages with which I'm already familiar (C/C++/Java) 
get you programming in record speed.&quot;</p>

<b>This review is from: 
Core Python Programming (Open Source Technology) (Paperback)</b>  For the last 
few months I was developing in Perl. But I found myself very frustrated with

<b>This review is from: Core Python Programming (Open

to Bruce Eckel's. Both authors present somewhat abstract concepts in a clear 
and concise way that makes reading their material enjoyable. I highly recommend 
this book for any novice programmer wanting to learn Python. Chun does a good 
job explaining OOP concepts, so if you only have experience with a procedural 
language (C, Pascal, etc.)don't worry. If you are a programming expert, purist, 
guru, or OOP king you may find this book a bit long and shallow.:) <b>Help

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<b>This review is from: Core Python Programming (Open Source 
Technology) (Paperback)</b>  Definitely worth 5 stars. The book clearly 
explains its purpose, and the author makes his methodologies known in the 
beginning as to how he will approach teaching the language. His explanations 
are clear and concise, and it does not contradict the DOCS available on the 
Python web site. He's both humorous and informative, with a relaxed style of 
writing.
<p>The code in itself is neatly organized, clearly explained, and overall, it 
works. He does cover a lot of Python basics, the majority of the book are 
Python basics. He also covers advanced topics such as network programming, 
extending Python through C/C++ modules, and multithreading. All of which are 
important, being able to write distributed applications, writing responsive 
programs, and being able to extend the language are all equally important. 
Python's power is clearly explained and logically thought-out in this book. I 
would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Python but are new to 
programming.</p>

<h3>Preface</h3> 
<p> <strong>Welcome to Core Python Programming!</strong> </p> 
<p>We are delighted that you have engaged us to help you learn Python as 
quickly and as in-depth as possible. Learning the syntax is one goal of this 
book; however, we also believe that if you learn how Python works under the 
covers, you won't just be able to program in Python, but you will write more 
effective Python applications even as a beginner to the language. As you know, 
just because you learn a language's syntax does not make you competent in it 
right away.</p> 
<p>Throughout the book, you will find many examples that you can try right in 
front of your computer. To hammer the concepts home, you will also find fun and 
challenging exercises at the end of every chapter. These easy and intermediate 
exercises are meant to test your learning and push your Python skills. There 
simply is no substitute for experience. We believe you should not only pick up 
Python programming skills but also be able to master them in as short a time 
period as possible.</p> 
<p><strong>About This Book</strong> </p> 
<p>This book differs from other Python books on the market by presenting a 
broad range of topics, providing numerous examples, and going in-depth where 
necessary. This book does not require a specific background such as prior 
knowledge of C or object-oriented programming. It is also not a large case 
study book that does not facilitate picking up the language quickly. Finally, 
this book is not a pure reference nor is it meant to be a quick 
&quot;dive&quot; into Python. What we have is an extremely comprehensive 
introduction to the core features of the language (Part I) followed by a set of 
chapters that delve into specific areas of intermediate Python programming.</p> 
<p>This book is 40 percent introductory, 40 percent intermediate to advanced, 
and 20 percent reference. It is targeted toward technical professionals who are 
already familiar with programming in one other high-level language, as well as 
university/college and secondary students. Because Python is used in larger 
solutions such as Zope, Plone, MailMan, and Django, this book may be used by 
principals developing, managing, maintaining, or integrating with those systems.
</p> 
<p>With regard to the code in this book, about a third of the first edition 
readers sent in complaints that there were not enough large, full-fledged 
applications in the book, or that the code examples were not long or 
comprehensive enough. Everyone else wrote that they loved the short, 
easy-to-understand examples and were not bored of page after page of 
mind-numbing code. The philosophy behind more short examples is to give you the 
ability to look at a piece of code and grasp its entirety. These turn into 
building blocks to understanding and then can be incorporated into larger 
applications as well. There are line-by-line explanations for most of the 
larger programs in the book. The abundant interpreter code snippets scattered 
throughout the book are there for you to try on your computer as you are 
learning Python&#151;use the interactive interpreter as much as possible. You 
not only learn and improve your Python from using it, but you can also benefit 
from working out bugs in your code before you paste it into your source file.
</p> 
<p>Because you cannot learn Python well without practice, you will find the 
exercises at the end of every chapter to be one of the greatest strengths of 
this book. They will test your knowledge of chapter topics and definitions, as 
well as get you to code as much as possible. There is no substitute to learning 
a programming language faster and more effectively than by building 
applications. You will find easy, intermediate, and difficult problems to 
solve. It is also here that you may have to write one of those 
&quot;large&quot; applications that many readers wanted to see in the book, but 
rather than having me do it, you gain the most from such exercises. Appendix A 
features answers to selected problems from each chapter.</p> 
<p>Another set of first edition readers remarked how useful the reference 
tables were throughout the book, and how they meticulously copied them for 
reference. Well, instead of flipping through each chapter looking for the 
tables, we have summarized the most highly used ones in Appendix B. Thanks for 
all of your feedback. I encourage you to keep talking to us and help us make a 
third edition possible and better than its predecessors!</p> 
<p>Finally, both the &quot;Other References&quot; appendix and the CD-ROM from 
the first edition are not included with this edition. You would not believe how 
quickly Web links can become obsolete in six months much less six years! The 
most up-to-date source code and Python interpreters can easily be downloaded 
for offline use at the book's Web site, so there really is no reason to include 
a CD-ROM.</p> 
<p><strong>About the Reader</strong> </p> 
<p>This book is meant for you if you are a programmer completely new to Python 
or already know some Python but want to know more and improve your Python 
skillset. Python is used in many fields, including engineering, informa*tion 
technology, science, business, entertainment, and so on. This means that the 
list of Python users (and readers of this book) includes but is not limited to:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Software engineers </li> 
<li>Hardware design/CAD engineers </li> 
<li>QA/testing and automation framework developers </li> 
<li>IS/IT/system and network administrators </li> 
<li>Scientists and mathematicians<br>
</li> 
<li> Technical or project management staff <br>
</li> 
<li>Multimedia or audio/visual engineers SCM or release engineers</li> 
<li>Web masters and content management staff</li> 
<li>Customer/technical support engineers</li> 
<li>Database engineers and administrators </li> 
<li>Research and development engineers <br>
</li> 
<li>Software integration and professional services staff<br>
</li> 
<li>Collegiate and secondary educators <br>
</li> 
<li>Web service engineers <br>
</li> 
<li>Financial software engineers <br>
</li> 
<li>And many others <br>
</li> </ul> 
<p>Some of the most famous companies using Python include Google, Yahoo!, 
NASA, Lucasfilm/Industrial Light and Magic, Red Hat, Zope, Disney, Pixar, and 
Dreamworks.</p> 
<p><strong>The Author's Experience with Python</strong> </p> 
<p>I discovered Python over a decade ago at a company called Four11. At the 
time, the company had one major product, the Four11.com White Page directory 
service. Python was being used to design our next product: the Rocketmail 
Web-based e-mail service that would eventually evolve into what today is 
Yahoo!Mail.</p> 
<p>It was fun learning Python and being on the original Yahoo!Mail engineering 
team. I helped rearchitect the address book and spell checker. At the time, 
Python also made its way as part of a number of other Yahoo! sites, including 
People Search, Yellow Pages, and Maps and Driving Directions, just to name a 
few. I was the lead engineer for People Search.</p> 
<p>Although Python was new to me then, it was fairly easy to pick up&#151;much 
simpler than other languages I had learned in the past. The scarcity of 
textbooks at the time led me to primarily use the Library Reference and Quick 
Reference Guide as my tools in learning, and also led to the motivation for the 
book you are reading right now.</p> 
<p>Since my days at Yahoo!, I have been able to use Python in all sorts of 
interesting ways at the jobs that followed. In each case, I was able to harness 
the power of Python in solving the problems at hand and in a timely manner. I 
have also developed several Python courses and have used this book to</p>
