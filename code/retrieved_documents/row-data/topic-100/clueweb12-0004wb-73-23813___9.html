<p>Are you looking to get into data visualization, but don't quite know where 
to begin?</p> 
<p>With all of the available tools to help you visualize data, it can be 
confusing where to start. The good news is, well, that there are a lot of 
(free) available tools out there to help you get started. It's just a matter of 
deciding which one suits you best. This is a guide to help you figure that out.
<br> </p> 
<p>But before we get into what you should use, a couple of questions.</p> 
<h2>What data are you looking at?</h2> 
<p>Hopefully you already have a dataset that you're interested in. If not, go 
find one. It's important to have actual data when you're learning, because the 
visualization tool that you use will depend on it.</p> 
<p>There are lots of places on the Web to find data. Here are a few worth 
checking out:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Infochimps</li> 
<li>Freebase</li> 
<li>Many Eyes</li> </ul> 
<p>The above is a very small subset of what's available. Oh, and let's not 
forget all the government organizations that have departments dedicated to 
putting together datasets. Just pick one you're interested in.</p> 
<p>Got your data? Ok, good, on to the next step.</p> 
<h2>What's the purpose of your visualization?</h2> 
<p>The next step is to figure out you're trying to do with your visualization. 
Are you working on a Web application that has some graphs? Is it an interactive 
tool? Do you want to use better-looking graphs in your slide presentation? Is 
the visualization for a publication? Do you just need it for analysis?</p> 
<p>Again, what you decide here will affect what tool you should use.</p> 
<h2>What Visualization Software to Use</h2> 
<p>Now that you have the answers to those two questions in mind, we can make a 
decision on what will work best for you.</p> 
<h3>For Publication</h3> 
<p>This means graphics like what you see in the newspaper. Most people use 
Adobe Illustrator. It gives you control over all the elements in your graphic - 
color, stroke, font, orientation, etc.</p> 
<p>If you want to do something more complicated than your traditional graphs, 
you can design it by hand in Illustrator or your can do it inR (either 
programmatically or with one of the add-on libraries), which is a software 
environment for statistical computing and graphics. From R, you can import your 
file as a PDF into Illustrator. That's usually what I do.</p> 
<p>Illustrator is kind of pricey however. Some have suggested using the 
open-source alternativeInkscape. I've never tried it though.</p> 
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The New York Times</p> 
<h3>For Presentations</h3> 
<p>Many want to add some spice to their presentations. You can use the same 
software as the above, but there's also not much harm in using Microsoft Excel 
despite the stigma. The key here is not to use the default settings. You can 
actually do a lot in Microsoft Excel and make it look good. Plus, you don't 
need to include many details in a graphic made for presentation slides, because 
people can't see them from far away.</p> 
<p>Personally, I don't use it much for graphics since I'm comfortable with R 
and Illustrator.</p> 
<h3>For Analysis</h3> 
<p>There are a lot of analysis tools, and the preferred one will change depend 
on who you ask. I use R, which requires some programming skills. Most people 
use Excel. I've also heard a lot of good things aboutTableau Software. </p> 
<h3>For Web Applications</h3> 
<p>I'm going to assume you have a programming background if you're looking to 
do visualization for a Web application. If you don't know anything about 
computer code, you can try Many Eyes or Fusion Charts. You'll be limited to 
their offerings though.</p> 
<p>Now, if you're developing for the Web, there are two main options here. The 
first isProcessing, which was designed to make coding easier and to give you 
more bang for the buck. Check out the site and Processing forums for plenty of 
tutorials and tips. The end result is a Java applet.</p> 
<p>The second, more popular option is Flash. You can either do stuff in the 
actual Flash program, or you can use Actionscript for a pure coding solution. 
Either way, the end result is something that runs in the Flash environment. The
Flare visualization toolkit is a good place to start.</p> 
<p>The upside of Flash is that it tends to load faster than Java, and more 
people have Flash than Java installed on their computer. You might also be able 
to get away with just a little bit of code if you use just Flash, although, if 
you really want to get serious with visualization, you'll need to learn 
Actionscript.</p> 
<p>To that end, Processing is a lot easier to learn coding-wise. Plus it's 
free and open source.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Many Eyes, Rescue Time</p> 
<h3>For Art</h3> 
<p>Processing definitely seems to be the software of choice for artists and 
designers. Again, it goes back to how easy it is to learn and how much you can 
do with it. Illustrator is the most common choice for non-interactive graphics 
since it gives you drag-and-drop control over all the elements.</p> 
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Processing Gallery</p> 
<h2>What Software Do You Use?</h2> 
<p>This is obviously a small subset of what's available. Ultimately, 
visualization is not just about using one piece of software, but having a full 
toolbox at your disposal.</p> 
<p>Here's a list of all the programs, tools, and resources I frequently use. 
What do you use?</p> <br>

<p>my doings lean a little in the art direction, but I&rsquo;m originally from 
the infovis side.</p> 
<p>I use python for static graphics, and data &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; / 
&lsquo;cleaning&rsquo; , then Processing for realtime visualisation.</p> 
<p>the numerical python module &ndash; aka numpy &ndash; is great for data 
analysis and getting one&rsquo;s head quickly around the data.<br>
 Processing 
then has a nice speed for showing things.</p> <br>

<p>I was disappointed you didn&rsquo;t mentioned the JavaScript InfoVis 
Toolkit as a web visualization tool (http://thejit.org). </p> 
<p>Oh wait, I got a full post a while ago! 
http://flowingdata.com/2009/06.....-released/ :D</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d say that if you&rsquo;re looking for a nice integration with web 
standards the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit is a good option. For larger datasets 
Flare seams more suitable for this task. Also, Flare uses Flash which means 
that your visualization will work in 95% of browsers and machines (which is a 
good thing).</p> 
<p>I also use a lot of Python and Beautiful Soup for manipulating data.</p>

<p>r and it&rsquo;s various add on packages for more and more analysis and 
visualisation &ndash; rCurl comes in very handy for scraping data, along with 
ggplot, plyr and reshape to name a few.</p> 
<p>Also looking at workflows involving Excel -&gt; R -&gt; Powerpoint to speed 
up some chart generation.</p> 
<p>I also use Inkscape a little to tidy up R plots and add additional 
annotation</p> <br>

<p>I heart processing, especially offline, because java applets are annoyingly 
long to start. processing.js is getting much better though.<br>
 at work most 
of the 10k charts we publish each year are done in Excel, then imported in 
illustrator. Some are directly generated from Fame. Our online tools are 
usually done with flash or flex.</p> <br>

<p>Python is very good for static visualizations. I like a lot MatPlotLib 
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/: a python 2d plotting library.</p> 
<p>Another awesome software is NodeBox (that is python based too), 
unfortunately it&rsquo;s for mac-users only. It&rsquo;s a very good alternative 
to Processing in some specific jobs.</p> <br>

<p>Hi. For vector graphic I use Inkscape. It&rsquo;s free, far more usable 
than GIMP (another open source graphics program) and suits very well my needs. 
I love Processing but something that it cannot beat is Flash interactivity and 
it&rsquo;s graphics rendering tree object model. It makes Flash so much better 
for GUIs and interactive datavis. It can be also free if you use opensource 
Flex SDK for Actionscript programming. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a begginers 
level though.</p> <br>

<p>Great post Nathan. I have been to each of the web-based data sources you 
mention but had forgotten about 2 of the 3.</p> 
<p>Many of the other tools for publication on the web are new to me. I&rsquo;m 
pretty heavily into Tableau, Excel and SQL and have looked at R, but frankly it 
looks like the learning curve is too long to be worth the investment when tools 
like Tableau are available (if you have the funds) which do a very good job.</p>
<p>Thanks for this post. Very useful.</p> <br>

Mike &mdash; September 3, 2009 at 9:53 am <br>

<p>The R learning curve is very much worth it if you ever need to do anything 
beyond simple data manipulation that you are comfortable with in other 
programs. If you need to do any statistical analysis (which in my opinion would 
help a lot of visualizations be a lot more informative), you should really look 
into R.</p> <br>

</p> 
<p>which can be bought<br>
http://www.amazon.com/R-SAS-SP.....038;sr=8-1</p> 
<p>and of course, the R site. But all this needs MUCH time to learn so that 
you can smoothly use it.</p> <br>

<p>The data I work with is rarely clean or structured in a way ready to be 
vized. I use Lyza fromhttp://Lyzasoft.com to not only connect to many data 
sources and transform, but to figure out what data to look at with profiling 
and verify it is valid. I then viz it with Tableau so it is interactive. Both 
apps let me do most of the complex stuff with drag and drop, and create many 
iterations and approaches to the data quickly.</p> <br>

Frank &mdash; September 3, 2009 at 9:14 am <br>

<p>Interesting thread, Nathan. For me usability for the analysist and 
understandability for the enduser of the analysis are crucial, besides all the 
whistles and bells of nice viz gadgets.</p> 
<p>If the people that ordered the analysis don&rsquo;t understand the viz the 
work is useless.<br>
 This is an issue that does not pop up too much here, 
because statisticians love their tools. But it is the one that ordered that 
analysis who counts.</p> 
<p>I use OpenOffice for table analysis, because it does the same as Excel, and 
it has comparable graphing capacity, but costs nothing.<br>
 And a crosstab is 
often the most complicated tool a non-statistician can understand.</p> 
<p>For anything more complicated than table analysis spreadsheets are no good 
idea, you have to go for real stats packages. SPSS is a good tool that does not 
demand the steep learning curve of R.</p> 
<p>Most data are not clean when you get them, they have missing data, 
outliers, etc. The free ViSta (athttp://www.visualstats.org and at 
http://www.uv.es/~prodat/ViSta ) allows &ndash; among full multivariate stats 
&ndash; to run a visual Exploratory Data Analysis under Windows, Mac and Unix.

<p>Tableau is expensive and not as flexible as I&rsquo;d like, but 
there&rsquo;s a subset of tasks (basically making visualizations of 2 to ~5 
dimensional data stemming from an SQL query) for which it is excellent.</p> 
<p>Parallel Sets (see sig. URL) is interesting, but I haven&rsquo;t used it 
enough to understand what it&rsquo;s best suited for.</p> <br>

<p>The only product that we&rsquo;ve come across that can cover all three of

link analysis &ndash; is GeoTime. The others only paint a picture. GeoTime

<p>Thanks for the great summary. </p> 
<p>For web visualizations, I&rsquo;ve recently had great luck with flot.js for 
standard line charts. It&rsquo;s highly customizable and extremely fast.
http://code.google.com/p/flot/</p> 
<p>Also, the Rapha&euml;l Javascript library is great for drawing custom 
SVG/VML (compatible across browsers), basically any vector graphics.

<p>A very cool SVG-based alternative, in alpha stage and being written by Mike 
Bostock, a Stanford CS grad student of Flare&rsquo;s author Jeff Heer, is 
protovis (http://protovis.org/) I like it you can make very concise javascript

<p>Thanks for this post. I&rsquo;ve been wrestling with Mozilla&rsquo;s html 
pages lately, and it&rsquo;s just terrible. Java and html parsing don&rsquo;t 
seem to go together at all. I like the earlier user&rsquo;s suggestions of 
using python for the data parse and then Processing for the actual viz step.</p>
<p>Not only is Processing pretty easy, but it has such a great user community. 
Even if I feel my questions are lame, I always get a useful answer.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with Parallel Sets as well.</p> <br>

<p>I guess I need to check out R. I&rsquo;ve dabbled with Processing, but as a 
Flash+PHP developer, I typically stick to what I know best when trying to do a 
complex task.</p> 
<p>Probably not the most ideal method, but I&rsquo;ve actually used PHP (+GD2) 
when drawing images derived from large data sets that reside in MySQL 
databases. It was an easy way to go from query -&gt; image manipulation without 
having to create an API or anything.</p> <br>

<p>We use JuiceKit (http://juicekit.org) , our open-source lightly patched

In particular, we want to make it easy to make Flare visualizations that work 
with Flex data binding.</p>
