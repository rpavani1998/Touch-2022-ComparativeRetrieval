<strong>THE ZEN OF COMPREHENSIVE ARCHIVE NETWORKS</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Jarkko 
Hietaniemi, the CPAN Master Librarian, writes (viause Perl;) about applying the 
CPAN model to other languages/projects.<br>

<blockquote> <br>
&quot;It seems that there is a lot of interest in having 
similar archives for other languages like CPAN [1] is for Perl. I should know; 
over the years people from at least Python, Ruby, and Java communities have 
approached me or other core CPAN people to ask basically 'How did we do it?'. 
Very recently I've seen even more interest from some people in the Perl 
community wanting to actively reach out a helping hand to other communities. 
This 'missive' tries to describe my thinking and help people wanting to build 
their own CANs. Since I hope this message will somehow end up reaching the 
other language communities I will explicitly include URLs that are (hopefully) 
obvious to Perl people.&quot;<br>

<strong>LUSH
</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Skipping (painfully) the obvious puns for now, I'll get 
right to the author's description:<br>

<blockquote> <br>
Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for 
researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale numerical 
and graphic applications. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one 
would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, loosely-typed 
interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, 
natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in C, 
C++, or other languages.<br>

<p><br>
Lush can be used advantageously for projects where one would otherwise 
use a combination of an interpreted language like Matlab, Python, Perl, S+, or 
even (gasp!) BASIC, and a compiled language like C. Lush brings the best of 
both worlds by wrapping three languages into one: (1) a weakly-typed, 
garbage-collected, dynamically scoped, interpreted language with a simple 
Lisp-like syntax, (2) a strongly-typed, lexically-scoped compiled language that 
uses the same Lisp-like syntax, and (3) the C language, which can be freely 
mixed with Lush code within a single program, even within a single function. It 
sounds complicated, but it is not. In fact, Lush is designed to be very simple 
to learn and easy to use.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
If you do research and development in signal processing, image 
processing, machine learning, computer vision, bio-informatics, data mining, 
statistics, simulation, optimization, or artificial intelligence, and feel 
limited by Matlab and other existing tools, Lush is for you. If you want a 
simple environment to experiment with graphics, video, and sounds, Lush is for 
you.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Lush's main features include:<br>
</p> 
<ul> <br>

<li>a clean, simple, and easy to learn Lisp-like syntax;<br>
</li> 
<li>a compiler that produces very efficient C code and relies on the C 
compiler to produce efficient native code;<br>
</li> 
<li>an easy way to interface to C functions and libraries, and a powerful 
dynamic linker/loader for object files or libraries written in other compiled 
languages;<br>
</li> 
<li>the ability to freely mix Lisp and C in a single function;<br>
</li> 
<li>a powerful set of vector/matrix/tensor operations;<br>
</li> 
<li>a library of over 10,000 numerical routines, including full interfaces to 
GSL, LAPACK and BLAS;<br>
</li> 
<li>a library of image and signal processing routines;<br>
</li> 
<li>a extensive set of graphics routines, including an object-oriented GUI 
tookit, and interface to OpenGL, and an interface to OpenRM;<br>
</li> 
<li>an interface to the Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) multimedia library;<br>

</li> 
<li>sound and video grabbing (via ALSA and Video4Linux);<br>
</li> 
<li>several libraries for machine learning, neural nets, statistical 
estimation, etc.;<br>
</li> 
<li>libraries for computer vision and 3-D scene rendering;<br>
</li> 
<li>JavaVM and Python C API bindings.<br>
</li> </ul> </blockquote><br>
The 
documentation includes a 600 page reference manual and abrief tutorial. <br>

<strong>
PubScience Shuts Down</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
An InfoAnarchy article tells about 
the demise of a public database.<br>

<blockquote> <br>
After intense lobbying from the Software &amp; Information 
Industry Association (SIIA), the United States Department of Energy has shut 
down the PubScience database. On the site there is now only a message: 
&quot;PubScience has been discontinued&quot;. The old static content can still 
be viewed in the Web Archive (the database functionality is of course not 
mirrored there).<br>

<p><br>
PubScience was an index of scientific journals used by DoE researchers 
to publish their findings. It was not a full text database. A PubScience search 
result would give you the abstract of an article and a link to the publisher's 
page, where, depending on the publisher, you could either view the article for 
free, or buy it. In other words, it was a private/public partnership: 
PubScience provided the summaries for free, and if you wanted to read the full 
text, you usually needed a subscription or had to pay per article.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Nevertheless, there are commercial indexing services competing with 
PubScience, which offer some data for free, but often charge substantial sums 
even for viewing the abstracts (and will likely raise their prices now that the 
free competition is out of business). The SIIA lobbying eventually resulted in 
a bill with an attached report that recommended the closure of PubScience 
because of its competition with commercial services. The whole thing cost only 
$500,000 a year but was the most popular website of the DoE.<br>

<strong>PAKETTO 
KEIRETSU</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Dan Kaminsky of DoxPara Research has released 
Paketto Keiretsu, described atSlashdot as &quot;a collection of five interwoven 
'proofs of concept' that explore, extract and expose previously untapped 
capacities embedded deep within networks and their stacks.&quot; Brief 
descriptions of the five components are provided (although he provides another 
set of descriptions in a Slashdot post entitledWhat Paketto Is (In Simpler 
Terms)):<br>

<blockquote> <br>
<strong>scanrand</strong> <br>

<p><br>
Scanrand is a proof of concept, investigating stateless manipulation 
of the TCP Finite State Machine. It implements extremely fast and efficient 
port, host, and network trace scanning, and does so with two completely 
separate and disconnected processes -- one that sends queries, the other that 
receives responses and reconstructs the original message from the returned 
content. Security is maintained, in the sense that false results are difficult 
to forge, by embedding a cryptographic signature in the outgoing requests which 
must be detected in any received response. HMAC-SHA1, truncated to 32 bits, is 
used for this &quot;Inverse SYN Cookie&quot;.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>minewt</strong><br>
</p> 
<p> <br>
Minewt is a minimal &quot;testbed&quot; implementation of a stateful 
address translation gateway, rendered so entirely in userspace that not even 
the hardware addresses of the gateway correspond to what the kernel is 
operating against. Minewt implements what is common referred to as NAT, as well 
as a Doxpara-developed technique known as MAT. MAT, or MAC Address Translation, 
allows several backend hosts to share the same IP address, by dropping the 
static ARP cache and merging Layer 2 information into the NAT state table. 
Minewt's ability to manipulate MAC addresses also allows it to demonstrate 
Guerilla Multicast, which allows multiple hosts on the same subnet to receive a 
unicasted TCP/UDP datastream from the outside world. Minewt is not a firewall, 
and should not be treated as such.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>lc</strong><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Linkcat(lc) attempts to do to Layer 2 (Ethernet) what Netcat(nc) does 
for Layer 4-7(TCP/UDP): Provide direct, bidirectional, streaming access to the 
network. Lib cap/tcpdump syntax filters may be specified in either direction, 
but no filtering is enabled by default. Two separate syntaxes are supported; 
one accepts and emits libpcap dump format(raw binary w/ a fixed size file 
header and a fixed size packet header), the other accepts and emits simple hex 
w/ backslash line continuation. Several other features are also implemented; 
specifically, early work involving the embedding of cryptographic shared- 
secret signatures in the Ethernet Trailer is demonstrated.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>phentropy</strong><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Phentropy plots an arbitrarily large data source (of arbitrary data) 
onto a three dimensional volumetric matrix, which may then be parsed by 
OpenQVIS. Data mapping is accomplished by interpreting the file as a one 
dimensional stream of integers and progressively mapping quads in phase space. 
This process is reasonably straightforward: Take four numbers. Make X equal to 
the second number minus the first number. Make Y equal to the third number 
minus the second number. Then make Z equal to the last number minus the third 
number. Given the XYZ coordinate, draw a point. It turns out that many, many 
non-random datasets will have extraordinarily apparent regions in 3-space with 
increased density, reflecting common rates of change of the apparently random 
dataset. These regions are referred to as Strange Attractors, and can be used 
to predict future values from an otherwise random system.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>paratrace</strong><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Paratrace traces the path between a client and a server, much like 
&quot;traceroute&quot;, but with a major twist: Rather than iterate the TTLs of 
UDP, ICMP, or even TCP SYN packets, paratrace attaches itself to an existing, 
stateful- firewall-approved TCP flow, statelessly releasing as many TCP 
Keepalive messages as the software estimates the remote host is hop-distant. 
The resultant ICMP Time Exceeded replies are analyzed, with their original 
hopcount &quot;tattooed&quot; in the IPID field copied into the returned 
packets by so many helpful routers. Through this process, paratrace can trace a 
route without modulating a single byte of TCP/Layer 4, and thus delivers fully 
valid (if occasionally redundant) segments at Layer 4 -- segments generated by 
another process entirely.<br>
</p> </blockquote><br>

implementations of each is available under the BSD License. <br>

<strong>LINUX SOFTWARE 
ENCYCLOPEDIA</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
I've been keeping the Linux Software 
Encyclopedia going for nearly seven years now, although updates have been very 
sporadic over the last two or three. You'll find a horrific number of dead 
links, but the installation of a DSL line at my Unindicted Co-Conspirator's 
place will allow me to get back to occasional updates in the near future. <br>

<strong>PROGRAMMING TEXTS AND TUTORIALS</strong>
<br><br>
<br>
I've recently had occasion to update and expand several parts of 
myPrograming Texts and Tutorials page. The dotcom meltdown has led to more than 
a few dead links, but most of the stuff I originally found 3 or 4 years ago is 
still out there, along with all sorts of spiffy new things. Follow the links in 
the &quot;Recent Changes&quot; section to find the updated sections. Enjoy. <br>

<strong>QUANTUM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</strong><br>

<br><br>
The fine folks at  Lambda the Ultimate, a weblog whose discovery 
provided a lot of the impetus for splitting my software stuff off into this 
weblog, have found a fascinating paper about the development of alanguage for 
quantum programming. It's 42 pages and available in DVI, PostScript and PDF.

<strong>LAPACK/BLAS AND CLUSTERING</strong>
<br><br>
<br>
In the course of investigating options for a cluster of Linux 
boxes hereabouts, I've cobbled together the beginnings of a Scientific 
Computing on Linux web page. It currently contains information about the 
varieties of BLAS and LINPACK available for Linux programs, as well as 
overviews of the available clustering packages. <br>
