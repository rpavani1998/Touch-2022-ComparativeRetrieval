<h1>Analysis Exchange</h1> Posted on December 2, 2010 by MichaelDHealy <br>

<h1>Analysis Exchange</h1> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for all your help this summer. I&rsquo;ve started to 
implement some of the suggestions you made and there are more on the way.&rdquo;
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I received that update from the first client I worked with in the Analysis 
Exchange, which was more than anything else, the single most awesome part of 
participating in the Analysis Exchange. A personal note outside the scope of 
required end of project evaluations reminded me that the organizations are 
using the insights which we worked so hard to produce.</p> 
<p>The projects I was able to work on as a student were just about the most 
fun I had at work . . . ever. As a result of the projects I was mentioned in a 
of web analyticsblog, went to XChange in Monterey, and created some interesting 
charts and graphs which elucidated key points to the non-profits.</p> 
<h2>Non-Profit Benefits</h2> 
<p>The Analysis Exchange, which you should by now know, is a volunteer effort 
to connect three groups:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Non-Profits Looking For Online Insights</li> 
<li>Mentors Giving Back and Taking on Another Direct Report</li> 
<li>Learners Trying To Get Into Web Analytics</li> </ul> 
<p>Eric Peterson of Web Analytics Demystified put this whole thing together 
and has done what can only be described as a phenomenal job. I formally 
nominate him for the whatever community award is available for web analytics.
</p> 
<h2>Mentoring Success</h2> 
<p>Whenever I talk about my mentors in the Analysis Exchange with people from 
the industry I don&rsquo;t have to explain who they are, or even where they 
work. I haven&rsquo;t been able to determine if this is a function of an 
interconnected community or their individual awesome-ness, but it was again my 
great fortune to work with three extremely well recognized people in the web 
analytics community.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Michael Helbling</li> 
<li>Michele Hinojosa</li> 
<li>Jason Thompson</li> </ul> 
<p>My mentors provided key points at just the right time which pushed the 
projects towards success, keep them in mind for the future recruiters.</p> 
<h2>Improvement</h2> 
<p>Organizations looking for new talent seem to often be tool specific, my 
perspective as an individual speaking with companies is:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The lack of experience on a tool outside of Google Analytics hurts 
candidates</li> </ul> 
<p>Since the Analysis Exchange is, rightly, committed to free tools so 
everyone can have access this is likely an issue larger than the current effort.
</p> 
<h2>Industry Expert Opinions</h2> 
<p>Perhaps we, the measure community, could do more to echo Marshall Sponder 
[via Anil Batra'sblog]:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The least important thing is to know the tools beforehand &ndash; 
because anyone can learn them fairly quickly who is not brain dead (yet this is 
precisely what most interviewers ask for first &ndash; knowledge of the 
tools)&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>As part of a Web Analytics Association Career Development project I have 
reviewed numerous anecdotal interviews with respected members of the web 
analytics community.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>These interviews largely omit tool specific knowledge</li> </ul> 
<h2>Mentoring the Analysis Exchange</h2> 
<p>Transitioning to a mentor has further reinforced Marshall&rsquo;s notion 
that smart people will pick up the tools:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Student: Pandu Truhandito 
<p>Even at this early stage of the project he is asking all the right 
questions, in particular I am impressed with his understanding of statistics.
</p></li> 
<li>Contact: Stephen Blyth 
<p>Stephen took the extra effort to ask a question related to the project of 
interested participants; this extra effort made me even more excited than I was 
to work on the project.</p></li> 
<li>Non-Profit: New Zealand Drug Foundation 
<p>An NGO which for over 20 years has &lsquo;advocated strongly for policies 
and practices based on the best evidence available&rsquo; to reduce and prevent 
harm from drugs in New Zealand; research from one of my advisors on this topic 
ishere.</p></li> </ul> 
<p>Working on challenging projects with inquisitive people is something that I 
very much enjoy.</p> 
<h2>Contact</h2> 
<p>If you are in the SF Bay Area, or willing to work with someone remotely, 
and could use:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Econometrics, Linguistics, R, Python, Google Analytics and more: 
<p>Yes</p></li> 
<li>Omniture,Coremetrics, Unica 
<p>Not Yet</p></li> </ul> 
<p>Email me, or give me a call at (415) 294-1839.</p> 
<p>If you just want to ask about the Analysis Exchange, or talk about the 
economics of crime, that would be cool too.</p>
