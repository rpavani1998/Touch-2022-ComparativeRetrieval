<h3> PyCon 2011 - Data, Men, and Me </h3>  In the past couple years, I've 
switched from sending myself to research conferences (like CHI) to more 
down-and-dirty developery conferences. I'm looking for skills development and 
tools I can use day-to-day. This spring I went to PyCon in Atlanta, since I've 
been using Python more and more for data analysis problems. (Complete talk 
videos arehere on blip.tv.) 
<p>The initial draw was the  tutorials. I aimed for cloud data and machine 
learning. Olivier Grisel's tutorialApplied Machine Learning in Python with 
scikit-learn was a definite high point of the conference for me. His talk on 
text analysis was very good as well -slides here, and video here. His French 
accent was very nice, but I kept mishearing &quot;scikit-learn&quot; as 
&quot;psychic learn.&quot; :-) I also really enjoyed the talk on Genetic 
Algorithms by Eric Floehr, a fellow who seems to do weather prediction 
consulting. His slides and a bunch of other interesting supporting material 
(including code) are upon his site. </p> 
<p>There were a lot of talks on data, big data, cloud data, and scaling Python 
(to handle big data and data problems). Other examples: A talk onPypes by Eric 
Gaumer included a good reminder that big data problems existed in the search 
engine space long before other kinds of big data became &quot;hot&quot; to work 
on. Pypes is a quasi-visual toolkit for doing data processing inspired by Yahoo 
pipes. (The gist being that since a lot of data handling involves discrete 
steps to clean and transform, you can put these steps into little modules that 
allow you to view the big picture of what's going on with your data munging.)
</p> 
<p>Hilary Mason's excellent keynote made a lot of us data geeks happy; she 
called for programming language evolution to get closer to the data problems, 
and to be less cryptic when it comes to support for multi-threading and 
map-reduce strategies needed these days. (I loved her &quot;WTF?&quot; comment 
on her multithreading code example.) Yelp's&quot;mrjob&quot; library for the 
cloud might answer some of her issues, but I missed that talk for some reason!
</p> 
<p>Another talk on big data that was well-tweeted was C. Titus Brown's 
&quot;Handling Ridiculous Amounts of Data with Probabilistic Data 
Structures.&quot;Slides here - probably requires the video to fully interpret 
this, at least it does for me (yes, I missed this one too).</p> 
<p>Not all talks were excellent, of course. My linguistics degrees got grouchy 
during one on the linguistics of twitter -- or maybe it was my geeky side 
asking &quot;what can I do with this?&quot; Some talks were nice surprises, 
too, kind of the point of going to conferences! Based on lunch table 
happenstance, I ended up going to aBlender API talk by Chris Allan Webber, a 
subject about which I knew zilch. Blender is apparently beefing up its API for 
external calls and automation; as a visualization person, I'm interested in 
tools that I can &quot;drive&quot; with data as input. I have big hopes for the 
evolution ofprocessing.py and Nodebox2, two pythonic visualization options, but 
I am not sure they're there yet for me as a data vis person.</p> 
<p>My sad female nerd note: I was one of 3 women in the Machine Learning 
tutorial. Out of perhaps 40? I later heard via Twitter a guess that there were 
only 8% women at the conference as a whole, based on t-shirt orders. I loved 
Hilary's talk, but was a bit bummed out by the Dropbox keynote that featured 
the social network of &quot;friends of Arash&quot; who started that company -- 
yeah, all men.</p> 
<p>A final comment for any UX folks reading this: This would've been a great 
audience for a talk on UI design in open source, or UI design for Python UI's. 
There were a lot of companies presenting: Dropbox did their &quot;we use 
Python&quot; talk; Evite apparently has rewritten their entire java backend in 
Python; Threadless, a sponsor, is all Python... One of the reasons for its 
growth at these companies is the ease of writing things fast in Python; the 
&quot;prototype and iterate&quot; philosophy showed up over and over in various 
presentations as a real strength of Python. As a light coder myself, I can't 
agree more. I was there as a data-oriented geek, but I saw UX opportunity 
everywhere, for the right kinds of UX folks.</p>  Posted by  Lynn  at 5:12 PM
