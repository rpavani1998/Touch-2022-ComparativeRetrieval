<title>Using Python to Create Input Files</title>

<h2>Using Python to Create Input Files</h2> 
<p> Shaping raw data into the appropriate input file for analysis via MARK, 
CAPTURE, and other programs can be time consuming and fussy. It is often useful 
to write a short program to do this automatically, especially when more than 
one (or one very complex) input file is required. Generically, this function is 
called data parsing. Several freely available programming languages can be used 
to perform data parsing, including:<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Awk: A special-purpose language for data formatting.</li> 
<li>R: A public license clone of S-Plus. Can manipulate data, analyse, and 
chart all in one place.</li> 
<li>Python: An object-oriented programming language, easy to use, with lots of 
useful modules for database access, numerical methods, etc.</li> 
<li>Perl: A scripting language, similar and older than Python. Powerful, but 
hard to learn.</li> 
<li>Ruby: A very new language, also similar to Python.</li> </ul> All of these 
programs run on almost every computer platform available. I will illustrate how 
to set up and use Python, as an example.<br>
<br>
 The two most common desktop 
platforms Linux and Windows. If you a re a Windows user, you need to grab a 
couple of installation packages to get started:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>A current release of Python itself ( download)</li> 
<li>Windows extensions, for database access ( download)</li> </ul> You can 
install these programs in-place, by telling Windows to run the install file, 
rather than save them to disk.<br>
<br>
 After installation, in your programs 
menu, you should see a folder containing links to all of the Python 
executables, including a workplace shell, called &quot;pythonwin&quot;. This 
provides an interactive window, plus a text editor for writing and debugging 
files.<br>
<br>
 Here are two sample scripts showing how to construct input 
files from data in a relational database. In this case, MySQL was used, but the 
methods for other databases, such as Access, Postgresql and Oracle, are similar:
<br> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Nesting success: Input file for Program MARK in encounter history format. 
Contains records for Warbling Vireos in Southern B.C., ath three different 
study sites.</li> 
<li>Band recovery: Input file using the Brownie parameterization for analysis 
by Program MARK. Uses command-line arguments to select appropriate records.</li>
</ul> After you have installed Python and downloaded one of these sample files, 
you should be able to right-click a file in your file manager, and select 
&quot;edit&quot;. This will bring up the program in the python development 
environment. Feel free to modify, use and redistribute these files as you like.
<br> <br>
 It is always handy to have a command reference nearby. The help 
files for Python are excellent, and the manual inculdes a tutorial. There you 
will also find references for the syntax to connect to your favorite Windows 
database using ODBC. If you need help setting up ODBC data sources on your 
computer, send me anemail, and I will give you a hand. <br>
