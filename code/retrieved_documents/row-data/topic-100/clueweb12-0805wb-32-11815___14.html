<h3>importspss.ado (requires&nbsp;R)</h3> 
<p>| Gabriel |</p> 
<p>Mike Gruszczynski has a post up pointing out that you can use R to 
translate files, for instance from SPSS to Stata. I like this a lot because it 
let&rsquo;s you avoid using SPSS but I&rsquo;d like it even better if it let 
you avoid using R as well.</p> 
<p>As such I rewrote the script to work entirely from Stata. Mike wanted to do 
this in Bash but couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to pass arguments from the shell 
to R. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know how to do this either which is why my 
solution is to have Stata write and execute an R source file so all the 
argument passing occurs within Stata. This follows my general philosophy of 
doing a lot of code mise en place in a user-friendly language so I can spend as 
little time as necessary in R. (Note that you could just as easily write this 
in Bash, but I figured this way you can a) make it cross-platform and b) attach 
it to &ldquo;use&rdquo; for a one-stop shop &ldquo;import&rdquo; command).<br>

<h3>Thanks for the Aspirin&nbsp;Guys</h3> 
<p>| Gabriel |</p> 
<p>In a recent post, I lamented that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do 
loops and a few other things in R. The script at issue was intended to create a 
slideshow of network graphs which I&rsquo;d then use Image Magick to convert to 
an animated gif. With some help from Brian and Kieran, I ultimately got it to 
work and the results are inthis post (as well as a presentation at a 
mini-conference I made a few days later).</p> 
<p>Kieran very generously further improved on the code at his own blog using 
simulated data. Kieran&rsquo;s code has a certain elegance to it, but 
it&rsquo;s an R style of elegance based on objects and lists and the like so 
it&rsquo;s not completely intuitive to me, despite his thorough commenting. 
Anyway, I worked his suggestions into my code (see below) and it works great.
</p> 
<p>Since Kieran was &ldquo;interested to see whether this approach was at all 
faster,&rdquo; I ran the old version and the new version with timestamps. (To 
make it fair, I commented out the &ldquo;pdf&rdquo; version of the flipbook, 
which only appears in the &ldquo;old&rdquo; code &mdash; this saves about one 
second). Turns out they&rsquo;re almost exactly the same speed &mdash; about 26 
or 27 seconds (it varies about a second or two every time I do it, sometimes 
new is faster, sometimes old). The vast majority of that half a minute is taken 
up by Image Magick. The actual R code only takes about 7 seconds to execute in 
either version. I think that&rsquo;s amazingly fast to import 60 or so datasets 
(albeit small datasets), generate two different FR layouts, apply the layouts 
to 60 or so graphs (albeit graphs that are written directly to disk rather than 
to screen), and do miscellaneous housekeeping. I haven&rsquo;t run a 
timestamped comparison, but my impression is that this is much faster than 
comparable operations in Pajek or NWB and appreciably faster than doing 
scatterplots in Stata.</p>

<h3>Network&nbsp;slideshow</h3> 
<p>| Gabriel |</p> 
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve gotten R and <code>igraph</code> to make a set of 53 
png files (seeyesterday&rsquo;s post), the next step is animating them. I did 
this using the command line toolImageMagick, which I installed using Fink, the 
(buggy) Mac version of the Debian package manager. Once ImageMagick is 
installed, I can do everything from directly within R using<code>system()</code>
. To accomplish this, I just added these lines of code to the end of 
yesterday&rsquo;s script. The &ldquo;mv&rdquo; commands are necessary because 
ImageMagick has a naive view of alphabetical order.<br>
</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Here are the results. Vertices are stations, which turn black when the 
station has begun playing &ldquo;My Humps&rdquo; by Black Eyed Peas. Yellow 
vertices have missing data on airplay (true missing data, not just 
right-censored). The graph layout is based on directed nominations from a 
survey so vertices near each other have low path length, but I hid the actual 
edges to preserve some privacy about the stations social network ties. My 
substantive interpretation of this animation (and a comparable event history) 
is that the network doesn&rsquo;t really matter and the endogenous cascade is 
based on attention to aggregate peer behavior rather than that of specific 
alters.<br>
<br>
 Note that you may have to click on the image to see the 
animation.</p>

<h3>More R&nbsp;headaches</h3> 
<p>| Gabriel |</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to play with the R package <code>igraph</code> and I 
think I&rsquo;ve gotten the hang of<code>igraph</code> itself but R itself is 
still pretty opaque to me and that limits my ability to use<code>igraph</code>. 
Specifically, I&rsquo;m trying to merge diffusion data onto a network graph and 
plot it as kind of a slideshow, where each successive image is a new period. I 
can actually do this, but I&rsquo;m having trouble looping it and so my code is
<em>very</em> repetitive. [Update, thanks to Brian Rubineau I've gotten it to 
work]</p> 
<p>First the two tricks that I have solved.</p> 
<p>1. Merging the diffusion data (a vertice-level trait) onto the network.</p> 
<p>The preferred way to do this is to read in the network file to R then merge 
in the vertice-level trait (or more technically, read the vertice data and 
associate it with the network data). This has proven really difficult to me so 
instead I wrote analternate version of <code>stata2pajek</code> that 
let&rsquo;s me do this within Stata. The upside is that I spend more time in 
Stata and less time in R, the downside to this is that I need a separate 
&ldquo;.net&rdquo; file for every version of the graph.</p> 
<p>2. Getting the different versions of the graph to appear comparable.</p> 
<p>It does no good to have multiple versions of a graph if they don&rsquo;t 
look at all similar, which is what you get if you generate the layout on the 
fly as part of each plot. The solution to this is to first generate a layout 
(the object &ldquo;la&rdquo;) then apply it to each graph by defining the 
&ldquo;layout&rdquo; parameter to &ldquo;=la&rdquo; within the 
&ldquo;plot.igraph()&rdquo; function.</p> 
<p>So instead of this:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>plot.igraph(chrnetbounded, layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, 
vertex.size=4, vertex.label=NA, vertex.color=&quot;red&quot;, 
edge.color=&quot;gray20&quot;, edge.arrow.size=0.3, margin=0)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>Do this:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre>la = layout.fruchterman.reingold(chrnetbounded) 
plot.igraph(chrnetbounded, layout=la, vertex.size=4, vertex.label=NA, 
vertex.color=&quot;red&quot;, edge.color=&quot;gray20&quot;, 
edge.arrow.size=0.3, margin=0)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now the problem I can&rsquo;t solve, at least with anything approaching 
elegance.</p> 
<p>3. Looping it.</p> 
<p>Currently my code is really long and repetitive. I want one graph per week 
for a whole year. To make 52 versions of the graph, I need about two hundred 
lines of code, whereas I should be able to just loop my core four lines of code 
52 times &mdash; pdf(); read.graph();plot.igraph();dev.off(). This works, but 
is ridiculous.</p> 
<p>The thing is that I can&rsquo;t figure out how to make a loop in R where 
the looping local feeds to be part of a filename. This kind of thing is 
trivially easy in Stata since Stata expands locals and then interprets them. 
For example, here&rsquo;s how I would do this in Stata. (I&rsquo;m using 
&ldquo;twoway scatter&rdquo; as a placeholder for &ldquo;plot.igraph()&rdquo;, 
which of course doesn&rsquo;t exist in Stata).</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> forvalues i=0/52 { use ties_bounded`i', clear twoway scatter x y graph 
export chrnet_hc`i'.png, replace }</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>R not only doesn&rsquo;t let you do this directly, but I can&rsquo;t even 
figure out how to do it by adding an extra step where the looped local feeds 
into a new object to write the filename. (The problem is that the 
&ldquo;paste()&rdquo; function adds whitespace). So basically I&rsquo;m at an 
impasse and I see three ways to do it:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wait for somebody to tell me in the comments how to do this kind of loop 
in R. (hint, hint).</li> 
<li>Give up on writing this kind of loop and just resign myself to writing 
really repetitive R code.</li> 
<li>Give up on using <code>igraph</code> from within R and learn to use it 
from within Python. I have basically zero experience using Python but it has a 
good reputation for usability. In fact, it only took me, a complete 
Python-noob, about ten minutes to figure out what&rsquo;s been a real stumper 
in R. I haven&rsquo;t yet worked<code>igraph</code> into this loop but 
I&rsquo;m thinking it can&rsquo;t be that hard.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<pre>for i in range(0,52): datafile='ties_bounded%d' % i # igraph code here 
that treats the python object &quot;datafile&quot; as a filename</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Update</b><br>
 So thanks to Brian Rubineau&rsquo;s suggestion on how to 
better use the &ldquo;paste()&rdquo; function, which is functionally equivalent 
to the second line of the Python code above. The catch is that you have to add 
a &ldquo;, sep=&rdquo;&quot; &rdquo; parameter to suppress the whitespace that 
had been annoying me. I thought I tried this already, but apparently not. 
Anyway, the Python / R method of first defining a new object then calling it is 
an extra step compared to Stata loops (where the looping local can expand 
directly) but it&rsquo;s still reasonably easy. Here&rsquo;s my complete R 
code, which I&rsquo;m now very happy with.<br>

<h3>R and&nbsp;TextMate</h3> 
<p>| Gabriel |</p> 
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve started dabbling in R, I figured I needed to get my 
text editor to highlight the Klingon-esque syntax. TextWrangler and Smultron 
already support R, but getting it for TextMate requires the Terminal:</p> 
<p><code>cd &quot;~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles&quot;<br>
 
svn co http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/R.tmbundle/</code></p> 
<p>Note that 64-bit R is buggy so if you have trouble piping scripts from 
TextMate to Rdaemon (i.e., the command line R running in the background), you 
can use the bundle editor to redirect it to &ldquo;R32&Prime; instead of just 
&ldquo;R&rdquo; which will force it to use the slightly slower but more 
reliable 32-bit R. Or if that&rsquo;s too hard, just stick to piping to R.app 
instead of Rdaemon.</p> 
<p>Also, as long as you&rsquo;re playing with the TextMate library, you might 
as well install &ldquo;GetBundles,&rdquo; a GUI frontend for browsing the 
TextMate bundle server.<br>
<code>svn co 
http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/GetBundles.tmbundle/</code></p> 
<p>Note that GetBundles (with &ldquo;s&rdquo;) supersedes the now defunct 
GetBundle (without &ldquo;s&rdquo;) that you might see mentioned if you google 
things like &ldquo;TextMate Bundle&rdquo; or &ldquo;TextMate R syntax&rdquo;.

<h3>some R baby&nbsp;steps</h3> 
<p>| Gabriel |</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to learn R a few times but the syntax has always been 
opaque to my Stata-centric mind. I think the trick is to realize that two of 
the key differences are that:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>whereas handles only come up in a few Stata commands (e.g., file, 
postfile, log), they are very important in R, what with all the 
&ldquo;&lt;-&rdquo; statements</li> 
<li>in R there&rsquo;s a much fuzzier line between commands and functions than 
in Stata. What I mean by this is both the superficial thing of all the 
parentheses and also the more substantive issue that often you don&rsquo;t put 
them one to a line and they just do something (like Stata commands) but you 
usually put them many to a line and feed them into something else (like Stata 
functions). Related to this is that the typical Stata line has the syntax 
&ldquo;verb object, adverb&rdquo; whereas the typical R line has the syntax 
&ldquo;object &lt;- verb(object2, adverb)&rdquo;</li> </ul> 
<p>The two combine in an obvious way with something as simple as opening a 
dataset, which is just<em>use file</em> in Stata but is <em>filehandle &lt;- 
read.table(&ldquo;file&rdquo;)</em> in R, that is, there&rsquo;s not a 
read.table() command but a read.table() function and you feed this function to 
a handle. (And people say R isn&rsquo;t intuitive!)</p> 
<p>At least I <strong>think</strong> that&rsquo;s a good way to think about 
the basic syntax &mdash; I suck at R and I really could be totally wrong about 
this. (Pierre or Kieran please correct me).</p> 
<p>Anyway, I wrote my first useful R file the other day. It reads my Pajek 
formatted network data on top 40 radio stations and does a graph.</p> 
<p><code># File-Name: testgraph.R<br>

 dev.off()<br>
</code><br>
 The weird thing 
is that it works fine in R.app but breaks when I try to R run from the 
Terminal, regardless of whether I try to do it all in one line or first invoke 
R and then feed it the script. [Update: the issue is a 32 bit library and 64 
bit R, the simple solution is to invoke &quot;R32&quot; rather than just plain 
&quot;R&quot;. see the comments for details]. Here&rsquo;s a session with both 
problems:</p>

 The 
problem seems to be that R (terminal) can&rsquo;t find the igraph library. This 
is weird because R.app has no trouble finding it. Furthermore, I get the same 
error even if I make sure igraph is installed directly from R (Terminal) in the 
same R session:</p> 
<p><code>chooseCRANmirror(graphics = FALSE)<br>
 
install.packages(&quot;igraph&quot;)<br>
 
source(&quot;/Users/rossman/Documents/book/stata/testgraph.R&quot;)</code></p> 
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s another difference with Stata, StataConsole knows 
where the ado library is. I&rsquo;d like to be able to use the Terminal mode 
for R as this would let me to reach my Nirvana-like goal of having a single 
script that does everything without any proximate human intervention. So 
I&rsquo;ll just ask? How do I get R (Terminal) to run as reliably as R.app? Is 
this a naive question?</p> 
<p>Or would it be better to try to feed R.app a &ldquo;source&rdquo; script 
from the command line? Much how like I can do this for Stata to launch a 
do-file into the Stata GUI<br>
<code>exec 
/Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/Contents/MacOS/stataMP

<h3>R, Stata and descriptive&nbsp;stats</h3> 
<p>| Pierre |</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how R can make complicated things look simple and simple 
things look complicated.</p> 
<p>I tried to explain in my previous post that R could have important 
advantages over Stata when it came to managing weird, 
&ldquo;non-rectangular&rdquo; datasets that need to be 
transformed/combined/reshaped in non-trivial ways: R makes it much easier to 
work on several datasets at the same time, and different types of objects can 
be used in consistent ways.</p> 
<p>Still, I haven&rsquo;t completely stopped using Stata: one of the things 
that bother me when I use R is the lack of nice and quick descriptive 
statistics functions like &ldquo;tabulate&rdquo; or &ldquo;tabstat&rdquo;. Of 
course, it is possible to use standard R functions to get about the same 
desired output, but they tend to be quite a bit more cumbersome. Here&rsquo;s 
an example:</p> 
<p><code>tabstat y, by(group) stats(N mean p10 median p90)</code></p> 
<p>could be translated into R as:</p> 
<p><code>tapply(levels(group), levels(group), function(i)<br>
cbind(N=length(y[
group== i],<br>
mean(y[group == i]),<br>
quantile(y[group == i], c(.1,.5,.9)))
</code></p> 
<p>or, for a more concise version:</p> 
<p><code>by(y, group, function(x)<br>
c(N=length(x),mean=mean(x),quantile(x,c(
.1,.5,.9)))</code></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s quite ugly compared to the simple tabstat command, but I could 
deal with it&hellip; Now suppose I am working on survey data and observations 
have sampling weights, and the syntax will have to get even more complicated 
&mdash; I&rsquo;d have to think about something for a few minutes, when all 
Stata would need is a quick [fw=weight] statement added before the comma.</p> 
<p>True, R can deal with survey weights, but it almost never matches the 
simplicity of Stata when all I am trying to do is get a few simple descriptive 
statistics on survey data:</p> 
<p>One of my latest problems with R involved trying to make a two-way table of 
relative frequencies by column with weighted data&hellip; yes, a simple 
contingency table! The table() function cannot even compare with Stata&rsquo;s 
tabulate twoway command, since:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> it does not handle weights;</li> 
<li> it does not report marginal distributions in the last row and column of 
the table (which I always find helpful);</li> 
<li> it calculates cell frequencies but not relative frequencies by row or 
column.</li> </ol> 
<p>Luckily, writing an R function that can achieve this is not too hard:</p> 
<p><code>col.table &lt;- function(var1, var2, weights=rep(1,length(var1)), 
margins=TRUE){<br>
# Creating table of (weighted) relative frequencies by 
column, and adding row variable margins as the last column<br>
 crosstab &lt;- 
prop.table(xtabs(weights ~ var1 + var2), margin=2)<br>
t &lt;- cbind(crosstab, 
Total=prop.table(xtabs(weights ~ var1)))<br>
# Adding column sums in the last 
row<br>
t &lt;- rbind(t,Total = colSums(t))<br>
# Naming rows and columns of 
the table after var1 and var2 used, and returning result<br>
names(dimnames(t)) 
&lt;- c(deparse(substitute(var1)), deparse(substitute(var2)))<br>
return(round(
100*t,2))<br>
}</code></p> 
<p>col.table(x,y,w) gives the same output as Stata&rsquo;s &ldquo;tabulate x y 
[fw=w], col nofreq&rdquo;. Note that the weight argument is optional so that: 
col.table(x,y) is equivalent to tabulate x y, col nofreq.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the same function, but for relative distributions by row:</p> 
<p><code>row.table &lt;- function(var1, var2, weights=rep(1,length(var1)), 
margins=TRUE){<br>
 t &lt;- rbind(prop.table(xtabs(weights ~ var1 + var2), 
margin=1),<br>
 Total=prop.table(xtabs(weights ~ var2)))<br>
t &lt;- cbind(t,
Total= rowSums(t))<br>
names(dimnames(t)) &lt;- c(deparse(substitute(var1)), 
deparse(substitute(var2)))<br>
return(round(100*t,2))<br>
}</code></p>

<h3>R, Stata and &ldquo;non-rectangular&rdquo;&nbsp;data</h3> 
<p>| Pierre |</p> 
<p>Thanks Gabriel for letting me join you on this blog. For those who 
don&rsquo;t know me, my name is Pierre, I am a graduate student in sociology at 
Princeton and I&rsquo;ve been doing work on organizations, culture and economic 
sociology (guess who&rsquo;son my committee). Recently, I&rsquo;ve become 
interested in diffusion processes &mdash; in quite unrelated domains: the
emergence of new composers and their adoption in orchestra repertoires, the 
evolution of attitudes towards financial risk, the diffusion of stock-ownership 
and the recent stock-market booms and busts.</p> 
<p>When Gabriel asked me if I wanted to post on this 
Stata/soc-of-culture-oriented blog, I first told him I was actually slowly 
moving away from Stata and using R more and more frequently&hellip; which is 
going to be the topic of my first post. I am not trying to start the first 
flamewar of &ldquo;Code and culture&rdquo; &mdash; rather I&rsquo;d like to 
argue that both languages have their own strengths and weaknesses; the 
important thing for me is not to come to a definitive conclusion (&ldquo;Stata 
is better than R&rdquo; or vice versa) and only use one package while 
discarding the other, but to identify conditions under which R or Stata are 
more or less painful to use for the type of data analysis I am working on.</p> 
<p>People usually emphasize graphics functions and the number of high-quality 
user-contributed packages for cutting-edge models as being R&rsquo;s greatest 
strengths over other statistical packages. I have to say I don&rsquo;t run very 
often into R estimation functions for which I can&rsquo;t find an equivalent 
Stata command. And while I agree that R-generated graphs can be amazingly cool, 
Stata has become much better in recent years. For me, R is particularly useful 
when I need to manipulate certain kinds of data and turn them into a 
&ldquo;rectangular&rdquo; dataset:</p> 
<p>Stata is perfect for &ldquo;rectangular&rdquo; data, when the dataset fits 
nicely inside a rectangle of observations (rows) and variables (colums) and 
when the conceptual difference between rows and columns is clear &mdash; this 
is what a dataset will have to look like just before running a regression. But 
things can get complicated when the raw dataset I need to manipulate is not 
already &ldquo;rectangular&rdquo;: this may include network data and multilevel 
data &mdash; even when the ultimate goal is to turn these messy-looking data, 
sometimes originating from multiple sources, into a nice rectangular dataset 
that can be analyzed with a simple linear model&hellip; Sure, Stata has a few 
powerful built-in commands (although I&rsquo;d be embarrassed to say how many 
times I had to recheck the proper syntax for &ldquo;reshape&rdquo; in the Stata 
help). But sometimes egen, merge, expand, collapse and reshape won&rsquo;t do 
the trick&hellip; and I find myself sorting, looping, using, saving and merging 
until I realize (too late of course!) that Stata can be a horrible, horrible 
tool when it comes to manipulating datasets that are not already rectangular. R 
on the other hand has two features that make it a great tool for data 
management:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>R can have multiple objects loaded in memory at the same time. Stata on 
the other hand can only work on one dataset at a time &mdash; which is not just 
inefficient (you always need to write the data into temporary files and read a 
new file to switch from one dataset to another), it can also&nbsp; 
unnecessarily add lines to the code and create confusion.</li> 
<li>R can easily handle multiple types of objects: vectors, matrices, arrays, 
data frames (i.e. datasets), lists, functions&hellip; Stata on the other hand 
is mostly designed to work on datasets: most commands take variables or 
variable lists as input; and when Stata tries to handle other types of objects 
(matrices, scalars, macros, ado files&hellip;), Stata uses distinct commands 
each with a different syntax (e.g. &ldquo;matrix define&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;scalar&rdquo;, &ldquo;local&rdquo;, &ldquo;global&rdquo;, &ldquo;program 
define&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;generate&rdquo;&hellip;) and sometimes a 
completely different language (Mata for matrix operations &mdash; which I have 
never had the patience to learn). R on the other hand handles these objects in 
a simple and consistent manner (for example it uses the same assignment 
operator &ldquo;&lt;-&rdquo; for a matrix, a vector, an array, a list or a 
function&hellip;) and can extract elements which are seamlessly 
&ldquo;converted&rdquo; into other object types (e.g. a column of a matrix, or 
coefficients/standard errors from a model are by definition vectors, which can 
be treated as such and added as variables in a data frame, without even using 
any special command &agrave; la &ldquo;svmat&rdquo;).</li> </ol> 
<p>In my next post, I&rsquo;ll try to explain why I keep using Stata despite 
all this&hellip;</p>
