<h3>Abstract:</h3>  We have developed a new CL for IRAF to allow us to develop 
scripts with capabilities not easily obtained in the current IRAF CL. The new 
CL is based on Python, a powerful, freely available object-oriented scripting 
language with an large and growing user base. We can run virtually all existing 
IRAF tasks with full functionality including interactive graphics and image 
display. Since there is a module for Python that provides IDL-like array 
manipulation, we expect to eventually combine the strengths of the IRAF and IDL 
environments into one system. 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> 1. Introduction </h3> 
<p> We have long felt there was an important role for a more powerful Command 
Language (CL) for IRAF. A suitably powerful CL could become the data analysis 
software language of first resort, one that both astronomers and programmers 
would consider using first and where writing applications in a traditional 
compiled language such as C, Fortran or SPP would be infrequently required. 
Nevertheless, when necessary, it should be easy to incorporate compiled code 
into the CL either as a task, or by calling newly added functions within a CL 
program. Furthermore, the CL should be useful not only as a tool for 
astronomical data reduction, but also for many other tasks including accessing 
databases, the web, and text processing. Since we have a large investment in 
existing IRAF tasks it is essential that a new CL provide full access to 
existing IRAF task functionality in a style that current IRAF users will find 
comfortable.</p> 
<p> Developing a new scripting language that satisfies these general 
requirements is not easy. We decided at the outset that the only practical way 
of developing a new IRAF CL was to adapt an existing scripting language to the 
task. By choosing suitably we would automatically get the wished-for attributes 
for free (except for the ability to run IRAF tasks).</p> 
<p> The above requirements and the attributes of the existing CL that we 
wished to preserve resulted in a more specific list of requirements for an 
acceptable scripting language.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>A powerful but clear programming language,</li> 
<li>Support for object-oriented programming,</li> 
<li>Syntactic and functional extensibility,</li> 
<li>Good error handling,</li> 
<li>Access to a wide base of libraries (built-in and external),</li> 
<li>Easy access to code written in standard languages such as Fortran, C, C++, 
and Java,</li> 
<li>IDL-like data access and image manipulation capabilities,</li> 
<li>Easy access to GUI facilities,</li> 
<li>Open Source and freely distributable,</li> 
<li>Portable,</li> 
<li>Large user base and good prospects for long term support.</li> </ul> 
<p> The popularity of IDL in the astronomical community (Shaw et al. 1999) has 
demonstrated that it is possible to write significant astronomical data 
analysis applications using an array-based interactive language. Having such a 
capability in a scripting language would enable it to serve for more than just 
scripting IRAF tasks; it would also be a language in which actual data analysis 
algorithms could be implemented directly.</p> 
<p> Our requirement for object-oriented features was born out of conviction 
that such a capability would make a new CL environment significantly more 
flexible and extendible.</p> 
<p> The requirement for a large user base stems from a natural desire to 
develop using software that has a large community of people supporting it. The 
larger the community involved, the more talent and resources are available to 
support the language itself as well as libraries it uses. An orphaned language 
presents the problem of providing support for the language and its libraries 
with limited resources and expertise.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> 2. Why Python? </h3> 
<p> One reason we chose Python as the basis for our new CL is because it 
satisfied these requirements. But what about its competitors? While Python is a 
reasonably well known scripting language, its user base is smaller than that of 
two better known scripting languages, namely Tcl and Perl. Nevertheless, we 
believe that the following characteristics dictated that Python be chosen over 
Tcl and Perl for our purposes.</p> 
<p> First, we felt that readability was an essential requirement. Since we 
expect that the new CL will be used more by astronomers than by professional 
software developers, we need a language that is both quick to learn and 
comparatively easy to read and understand for those who cannot devote large 
amounts of time to becoming an expert with it. In that regard we judged Python 
to be far superior to Perl. Python is also better for writing object-oriented 
programs since it was designed to be an object-oriented language from the 
start--though one can write procedural programs just as easily.</p> 
<p> While Tcl is generally more readable than Perl, its support for numeric 
types is weak. It is not a language we considered a natural choice for 
developing numerical algorithms. It also is not as well suited as Python for 
object-oriented programming.</p> 
<p> Array-based numeric operations are not part of the base Python system. But 
there is an extension module (Numeric) which does implement an efficient 
array-based functionality that can provide many of the features found in IDL 
and Matlab.</p> 
<p> Although Python's user community is smaller than that of Perl or Tcl, it 
is substantial and it is continuing to grow rapidly. It has been adopted by 
major organizations including Hewlett Packard, Red Hat, Industrial Light and 
Magic, and many others. While no language's future is guaranteed, we expect 
that Python will be well supported for many years to come.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> 3. Technical Challenges </h3> 
<p> With the adoption of Python, the primary technical challenge was reduced 
to being able to run IRAF tasks with full functionality. One condition that we 
set was that we should not require any changes in the IRAF system proper. The 
new CL must coexist with the existing system and CL.</p> 
<p> <b> Task Control and Execution.</b> To run IRAF tasks, we must emulate 
IRAF task control and communications faithfully enough that tasks ``believe'' 
they are communicating with the old IRAF CL. IRAF tasks run as connected 
subprocesses and multiplex several I/O channels onto the executable's stdin and 
stdout channels. We were able to adapt an existing module written in Python to 
start and communicate with an IRAF connected process, and we wrote Python code 
to handle the multiplexing/demultiplexing of IRAF I/O between Python and the 
IRAF task.</p> 
<p> <b> Traversing IRAF Packages and Interpreting Parameter Files.</b> To make 
tasks easy to use requires being able to interpret the IRAF package structure 
from package CL scripts (and thus being able to determine what packages are 
available, what tasks are contained within, and where the executables are 
located). We wished not to maintain any parallel configuration information but, 
rather, to use the information contained within IRAF itself. IRAF parameter 
files are an integral part of the IRAF system; any CL that wishes to use IRAF 
tasks must be able to interpret IRAF parameters in the same way the IRAF CL 
does. This includes handling typing issues, range or value checking and various 
other parameter attributes.</p> 
<p> <b> Graphics and Image Display.</b> The existing IRAF CL manages the 
graphics of IRAF tasks. Retaining graphics functionality requires being able to 
render the graphics stream from the task and being able to handle IRAF CL gcur 
mode for interactive graphics. We implemented a Python/IRAF graphics kernel 
using Tkinter and OpenGL libraries. While image display does not go through the 
CL, imcur interactions do, so it is necessary for a CL to be able to interact 
with the image display server (e.g., ximtool or saoimage). This capability was 
provided by wrapping the NOAO Client Display Library (Fitzpatrick 1997) with 
SWIG (Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator, Beazley 2000).</p> 
<p> <b> CL Emulation.</b> Without CL emulation, a number of IRAF tasks that 
exist as CL scripts will not be accessible in the new CL. The IRAF CL has a 
complicated syntax and semantics, and emulating it is not trivial. 
Nevertheless, we have written a CL compiler that converts CL procedures to 
Python using one of the Python parsing modules (SPARK, Aycock 1998).</p> 
<p> <b> Familiar User Interface.</b> While Python syntax is one that most 
programmers will find very straightforward, it is not one that all existing CL 
users will find convenient. We have provided a front end to the Python 
interpreter that allows the use of IRAF command mode syntax as well as standard 
mode syntax for interactive use.</p> 
<p> We have found Python to be both very powerful and productive. It has been 
one of those rare instances where we have accomplished more than we set out to 
do with significantly less effort than expected. We have implemented all of the 
above capabilities in Python itself. The only occasions we have had to resort 
to using C have been for Xlib manipulations not available in Tk (such as focus 
or cursor manipulations) and to wrap the Client Display Library. Speed has been 
an issue only during initialization on slow workstations.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> 4. Future Plans </h3> We see the development of a new CL--which we've 
dubbed ``Pyraf''--as having four phases. The first (completed) demonstrates 
that it is possible to run IRAF tasks with full functionality. The second makes 
Pyraf usable as a scripting language for IRAF. This involves supplying some 
utility functions and settling on public interfaces to IRAF tasks and 
environment. We have nearly completed this phase. Phase 3 makes Pyraf usable as 
an interactive environment for the typical astronomer. This includes supporting 
IRAF CL command mode syntax, providing a parameter editor (a prototype exists, 
see De La Pena 2000) and OS type utilities (e.g., dir, chdir, page, etc.), and 
logging. This phase will form the basis of our beta release (expected in 
December 1999).
<p> The final phase makes Pyraf usable for IDL-style analysis and programming. 
While there is existing functionality that allows much of this, we feel it is 
not quite mature enough to meet the expectations of most astronomers, 
particularly those who currently use IDL. Some improvements are needed to the 
Numerics module to fill holes in functionality and to make it more memory 
efficient. A full-featured, easy-to-use plotting package is needed (there is 
good progress in the Python community on that front). There is also work 
proceeding on enhancing the FITS I/O module (Barrett &amp; Bridgman 2000). An 
additional year will be needed to bring Pyraf to the point of being a practical 
alternative to IDL as a data analysis language.</p> 
<p> We are already beginning to use Python for new STScI tools. Initial 
projects include a GUI front end for Synphot, a revised dither package, and an 
ACS display tool. The first release is expected in the summer of 2000.</p>
