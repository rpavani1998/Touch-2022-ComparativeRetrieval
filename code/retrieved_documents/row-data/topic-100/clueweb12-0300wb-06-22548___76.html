<h1>Freely Available Software</h1> 
<h2>ANDX and ANAX</h2> 
<p> The ARM Program has developed ANDX (ARM NetCDF Data eXtract), a 
command-line utility designed for routine examination and extraction of data 
from netcdf files. Data can be displayed graphically (line-plot, scatter-plot, 
overlay, color-intensity, etc.) or extracted as ASCII data. Whether displayed 
graphically or extracted as ASCII, results can be saved to disk or viewed on 
screen.</p> 
<p> ANAX (ARM NetCDF ASCII eXtract) is a scaled-down version of ANDX -- it is 
designed to only extract ASCII data. All features of ANDX pertaining to 
non-graphic data extraction are included in ANAX.</p> 
<h2>ANTS</h2> 
<p> The ARM Program has developed ANTS (ARM NetCDF Tool Suite), a collection 
of netCDF tools and utilities providing various means of creating and modifying 
netcdf files. ANTS is based on nctools written by Chuck Denham. The utilities 
within nctools were modified to compile with version 3.5 of the netCDF library, 
the command syntax was modified for consistency with other tools, and changes 
were made to accommodate ARM standard netCDF.</p> 
<p> The original functions from nctools were intended mainly for the creation, 
definition, and copying of fundamental netCDF elements. ARM added others which 
focus on manipulation of data within existing netCDF files. Additional 
functions have special support for multi-dimensional data such as 
&quot;slicing&quot; cross sections from multi-dimensional variable data or 
joining lesser-dimensional fields to form multi-dimensional structures. 
Functions have been added to support execution of arithmetic and logical 
operations, bundling or splitting netCDF files, comparing the structure or 
content of files, and so on.</p> 
<p> Essentially every type of netCDF library function call is exercised in 
ANTS. In this way then, this open-source collection of tools also represents a 
library of coding examples for fundamental netCDF tasks. See thewebsite for 
more information.</p> 
<h2>ARGOS</h2> 
<p> ARGOS (interActive thRee-dimensional Graphics ObServatory) is a new 
IDL-based interactive 3D visualization tool, developed byDavid N. Bresch and 
Mark A. Liniger at the Institute for Atmospheric Science at the Swiss Federal 
Institute of Technology, ETH, Z&uuml;rich.</p> 
<p>A highly optimized graphical user interface allows quick and elegant 
creation of even complex 3D graphics (volume rendering, isosurfaces,...), 
including Z-buffered overlays (with hidden lines), light and data shading, Xray 
images, 3D trajectories, animations and virtual flights around your data, all 
documented in a full on-linehtml-help. The netCDF data format is preferred, but 
any other format can be read by providing an IDL (or FORTRAN or C or C++) 
interface. Some toolboxes (for atmospheric model output, trajectory display, 
radar data) have already been written, others might easily be added (in IDL, 
FORTRAN or C code). All interactive activities are tracked in a script, 
allowing quick reconstruction of anything done as well as running ARGOS in 
batch script mode.</p> 
<p>Information about copyright and licensing conditions are available. For 
further information and installation, please E-mail to: 
bresch@atmos.umnw.ethz.ch</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>CDAT</h2> The Climate Data Analysis Tool (CDAT), developed by the Program 
for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, provides the capabilities needed to analyze model data, 
perform complex mathematical calculations, and graphically display the results. 
It provides the necessary tools to diagnose, validate, and intercompare large 
observational and global climate model data sets.
<p> It includes the ability to ingest large climate datasets in netCDF, HDF, 
DRS, and GrADS/GRIB format; the Visualization and Computation System (VCS) 
module, visually displays and animates ingested or created data; and the 
Library of AMIP Data Transmission Standards (LATS) module outputs data in the 
machine-independent netCDF or GrADS/GRIB file formats.</p> 
<p> In addition, the Command Line Interface (CLI) module allows CDAT to 
receive argument and function input via the command line, and the Graphical 
User Interface (GUI) allows CDAT to receive argument and function input via a 
point-and-click environment.</p> 
<p> The software, which runs as a standalone process or within PCMDI's 
Visualization and Computation System (VCS), provides climate scientists with an 
easy and fast method to read different file formats, and to analyze and 
graphically display climate data in an integrated fashion. CDAT includes a set 
of pre-defined functions to allow the user to manipulate the data and send the 
output to a file which can be viewed as an image, or as a collection of images 
in an animation. The software has a gradual learning curve, allowing the novice 
user to quickly obtain useful results.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>CDFconvert</h2> 
<p> The MRG CDFconvert package provided by the Mesoscale Research Group, 
McGill University/SUNY Albany, is designed to address data conversion issues 
for gridded datasets stored under theCOARDS convention. CDFconvert converts 
regular Cylindrical Equidistant (Lat/Long) and Gaussian (Spherical) netCDF 
grids into either the CanadianRPN Standard File or GEMPAK file formats. MRG 
CDFconvert has the flexibility to handle netCDF files generated by a number of 
sources, including NCEP and ECMWF. User-definable conversion tables make the 
extension of the package to different datasets possible.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>cdfsync</h2> 
<p> Joe Sirott of NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory has developed 
cdfsync, a program that allows users to rapidly synchronize a set of netCDF 
files over a network. Fast synchronization times are achieved by only 
transmitting the differences between files. It is built on the Open Sourcersync 
program, but contains a number of optimizations including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Special handling of netCDF files for faster synchronization calculations
</li> 
<li>Much faster updates of large numbers of small netCDF files</li> 
<li>In-place updates of large netCDF files</li> </ul> 
<p>The latest version should run on Linux variants and Solaris.</p> More 
information is available at thecdfsync website. 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>CDO (Climate Data Operators)</h2> 
<p> Uwe Schulzweida at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology has developed 
CDO, a collection of Operators to manipulate and analyze Climate Data files. 
Supported file formats include netCDF and GRIB. There are more than 350 
operators available. The following table provides a brief overview of the main 
categories.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>File information (info, sinfo, diff, ...)</li> 
<li>File operations (copy, cat, merge, split*, ...)</li> 
<li>Selection (selcode, selvar, sellevel, seltimestep, ...)</li> 
<li>Missing values (setctomiss, setmisstoc, setrtomiss)</li> 
<li>Arithmetic (add, sub, mul, div, ...)</li> 
<li>Mathematical functions (sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, ...)</li> 
<li>Comparision (eq, ne, le, lt, ge, gt, ...)</li> 
<li>Conditions (ifthen, ifnotthen, ifthenc, ifnotthenc)</li> 
<li>Field statistics (fldsum, fldavg, fldstd, fldmin, fldmax, ...)</li> 
<li>Vertical statistics (vertsum, vertavg, vertstd, vertmin, ...)</li> 
<li>Time range statistics (timavg, yearavg, monavg, dayavg, ...)</li> 
<li>Field interpolation (remapbil, remapcon, remapdis, ...)</li> 
<li>Vertical interpolation (ml2pl, ml2hl)</li> 
<li>Time interpolation (inttime, intyear)</li> </ul> 
<p> As an example of use of CDO, converting from GRIB to netCDF can be as 
simple as</p> 
<pre> cdo -f nc copy file.grb file.nc </pre> or with relative time axis (for 
usage with GrADS)
<pre> cdo -r -f nc copy file.grb file.nc </pre> or using ECMWF reanalysis on a 
reduced grid
<pre> cdo -R -f nc copy file.grb file.nc </pre> 
<p></p> 
<p> More information is available on the CDO homepage. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>CIDS Tools</h2> The Center for Clouds Chemistry and Climate ( C4) 
Integrated Data Systems (CIDS) group has developed several useful netCDF 
utilities:
<ul> 
<li>cdf2idl: Writes an IDL script to read a NetCDF file.</li> 
<li>cdf2c: Writes C code to read a NetCDF file.</li> 
<li>cdf2fortran: Writes FORTRAN source code to read a NetCDF file.</li> 
<li>cdf2asc: Dumps NetCDF data to an ASCII file.</li> </ul> The source for 
these utilities can be downloaded fromCIDS NetCDF Visualization Tools site. 
<p></p> 
<h2>CSIRO MATLAB/netCDF interface</h2> The CSIRO MATLAB/netCDF interface is 
now available from theCSIRO Marine Laboratories. 
<p>The CSIRO MATLAB/netCDF interface is run from within MATLAB and has a 
simple syntax. It has options for automatically handling missing values, scale 
factors, and permutation of hyperslabs. It is, however, limited to retrieving 
data from, and information about, existing netCDF files.</p> 
<p>The basis of the interface is a machine-dependent mex-file called mexcdf53. 
Rather than call the mex-file directly users are advised to employ bothChuck 
Denham's netCDF toolbox and the CSIRO MATLAB/netCDF interface described here. 
For read-only access to existing netCDF data, the CSIRO interface has a simpler 
syntax than the netCDF Toolbox, but the latter may also be used to create and 
manipulate netCDF variables and datasets.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>EPIC</h2> NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory ( PMEL) has 
developed theEPIC software package for oceanographic data. EPIC provides 
graphical display and data field manipulation for multi-dimensional netCDF 
files (up to 4 dimensions). PMEL has been using this software on Unix and VMS 
several years. At present, they have:
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>a data file I/O library ( epslib, which is layered on top of the netCDF 
library).</li> 
<li>epslib allows transparent access to multiple data file formats</li> 
<li>a MATLAB MexEPS interface for using any supported EPIC file with MATLAB
</li> 
<li>suite of EPIC programs for graphics and analysis of hydrographic profile 
data and time series data.</li> </ul> This software was developed on Sun/Unix 
and is also supported for DEC/Ultrix and VAX/VMS as a system for data 
management, display and analysis system for observational oceanographic time 
series and hydrographic data. The EPIC software includes over 50 programs for 
oceanographic display and analysis, as well as utilities for putting in-situ or 
observational data on-line (with on-the-fly graphics and data download) on the 
WWW.
<p>The developers are interested in coordinating with others who may be 
developing oceanographic software for use with netCDF files. The EPIC software 
is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.noaapmel.gov in the epic/ and /eps 
directories. To obtain the EPIC software, please see Web pages at
http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/download/index.html. For information about EPIC, 
please see the Web pages athttp://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/index.html. Contact 
epic@pmel.noaa.gov, or Nancy Soreide, nns@noaapmel.gov, for more information.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Excel Use</h2> 
<p> Several packages are available for accessing netCDF data from Microsoft 
Excel, including thenetcdf4excel add-in for Excel, and a Scientific Dataset 
(SDS) Library that supports a DataSetEditor add-in for Excel to view and modify 
various forms of data, including netCDF.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>EzGet</h2> A FORTRAN library called EzGet has been developed at PCMDI to 
facilitate retrieval of modeled and observed climate data stored in popular 
formats includingDRS, netCDF, GrADS, and, if a control file is supplied, GRIB. 
You can specify how the data should be structured and whether it should undergo 
a grid transformation before you receive it, even when you know little about 
the original structure of the stored data (e.g., its original dimension order, 
grid, and domain).
<p>The EzGet library comprises a set of subroutines that can be linked to any 
FORTRAN program. EzGet reads files through thecdunif interface, but use of 
EzGet does not require familiarity with cdunif. The main advantages of using 
EzGet instead of the lower level cdunif library include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Substantial error trapping capabilities and detailed error messages</li> 
<li>Versatile capability of conveniently selecting data from specified regions 
(e.g., oceans, North America, all land areas north of 45 degrees latitude, etc.)
</li> 
<li>Ability to map data to a new grid at the time it is retrieved by EzGet</li>
<li>Automatic creation of ``weights'' for use in subsequent averaging or 
masking of data</li> 
<li>Increased control in specifying the domain of the data to be retrieved.
</li> </ul> 
<p>For more information about EzGet, including instructions for downloading 
the documentation or software, see the EzGet home page at
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ktaylor/ezget/ezget.html. For questions or comments 
on EzGet, contact Karl Taylor (taylor13@llnl.gov).</p> 
<h2>FAN</h2> FAN (File Array Notation) is Harvey Davies' package for 
extracting and manipulating array data from netCDF files. The package includes 
the three utilities nc2text, text2nc, and ncrob for printing selected data from 
netCDF arrays, copying ASCII data into netCDF arrays, and performing various 
operations (sum, mean, max, min, product, ...) on netCDF arrays. A library 
(fanlib) is also included that supports the use of FAN from C programs. The 
package is available via anonymous FTP from
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/fan.tar.Z. Questions and comments 
may be sent to Harvey Davies, harvey.davies@csiro.au.
<p></p> 
<h2>FERRET</h2> FERRET is an interactive computer visualization and analysis 
environment designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and meteorologists 
analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. It is available by anonymous ftp 
from abyss.pmel.noaa.gov for a number of computer systems: SUN (Solaris and 
SUNOS), DECstation (Ultrix and OSF/1), SGI, VAX/VMS and Macintosh (limited 
support), and IBM RS-6000 (soon to be released).
<p>FERRET offers a Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be 
defined interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables. 
Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully documented 
graphics are produced with a single command. Graphics styles included line 
plots, scatter plots, contour plots, color-filled contour plots, vector plots, 
wire frame plots, etc. Detailed controls over plot characteristics, page layout 
and overlays are provided. NetCDF is supported both as an input and an output 
format.</p> 
<p>Many excellent software packages have been developed recently for 
scientific visualization. The features that make FERRET distinctive among these 
packages are Mathematica-like flexibility, geophysical formatting 
(latitude/longitude/date), &quot;intelligent&quot; connection to its data base, 
special memory management for very large calculations, and symmetrical 
processing in 4 dimensions. Contact Steve Hankin, hankin@noaapmel.gov, for more 
information.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Fimex</h2> 
<p>Heiko Klein (Norwegian Meteorological Institute) has developed the fimex 
(File Interpolation, Manipulation, and EXtraction) C++ library for gridded 
geospatial data. It converts between several data formats (currently netCDF, 
NcML, GRIB1 or GRIB2, and felt). Fimex also enables you to change the 
projection and interpolation of scalar and vector grids, to subset the gridded 
data, and to extract only parts of the files. Fimex supports a growing list of 
otherfeatures, including support for most NcML features and for netCDF-4 
compression.</p> 
<p> For simple usage, Fimex also comes with the command line program fimex.</p>
<p>Documentation and downloads are available from the fimex web site.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>GDAL</h2> 
<p>Frank Warmerdam's GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data 
formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license. As a 
library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application 
for all supported formats. The relatedOGR library (which lives within the GDAL 
source tree) provides a similar capability for simple features vector data.</p> 
<p> GDAL is in active use in several projects, and includes roughly 40 format 
drivers, including a translator for netCDF (read/write). Other translators 
include GeoTIFF (read/write), Erdas Imagine (read/write), ESRI .BIL (read), 
.aux labeled raw (read/write), DTED (read), SDTS DEM (read), CEOS (read), JPEG 
(read/write), PNG (read/write), Geosoft GXF (read) and Arc/Info Binary Grid 
(read). A full list is available inSupported Formats. </p> 
<p> As an example of the use of GDAL, converting an ArcInfo ASCII grid to 
netCDF (GMT conventions) as easy as:</p>

<h2>Gfdnavi (Geophysical fluid data navigator)</h2> 
<p> Gfdnavi is a web-based tool to archive, share, distribute, analyze, and 
visualize geophysical fluid data and knowledge. The software is under 
development by members of the GFD Dennou Club, including T. Horinouchi (RISH, 
Kyoto U.), S. Nishizawa (RIMS, Kyoto U.), and colleagues. Gfdnavi uses a 
metadata database for managing and analyzing data and visualizations. It also 
permits publishing data for web access and will soon support access to data on 
other Gfdnavi servers. Web service APIs are now under development. A 
presentationIntroducing Gfdnavi describes the architecture and shows examples 
of use.</p> 
<p> Gfdnavi is dependent on two technologies: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ruby on Rails, a framework for web applications, and</li> 
<li>the Dennou Ruby Project, a collection of tools for geophysical data. These 
tools includeGPhys software to handle GRIB, GrADS, and netCDF data uniformly.
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>As an example of this technology, Takuji Kubota has established a Gfdnavi 
server for the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) project.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>GMT</h2> 
<p> GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) is an open source collection of about 60 tools 
for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend 
fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing Encapsulated PostScript File 
(EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps to 
artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views. GMT supports 30 
map projections and transformations and comes with support data such as 
coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries. GMT is developed and maintained 
by Paul Wessel and Walter H. F. Smith with help from a global set of 
volunteers, and is supported by the National Science Foundation. It is released 
under the GNU General Public License.</p> 
<p> The package can access COARDS-compliant netCDF grids as well as ASCII, 
native binary, or user-defined formats. The GMT package is available via 
anonymous ftp from several servers; seegmt.soest.hawaii.edu for installation 
information.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Grace</h2> Grace is a tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific 
data, including 1D netCDF variables. It runs under the X Window System and OSF 
Motif (recent versions of LessTif are, by and large, fine, too). Grace runs on 
practically any version of Unix. As well, it has been successfully ported to 
VMS, OS/2 and Win9*/NT (some functionality may be missing, though). Grace is a 
descendant of ACE/gr.
<p>A few features of Grace are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>User defined scaling, tick marks, labels, symbols, line styles, colors.
</li> 
<li>Batch mode for unattended plotting.</li> 
<li>Read and write parameters used during a session.</li> 
<li>Regressions, splines, running averages, DFT/FFT, cross/auto-correlation, 
...</li> 
<li>Support for dynamic module loading.</li> 
<li>Hardcopy support for PostScript, PDF, GIF, and PNM formats.</li> 
<li>Device-independent Type1 font rastering.</li> 
<li>Ability to read or write netCDF data.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h2>GrADS</h2> GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display System) is an interactive 
desktop tool fromCOLA/IGES that is currently in use worldwide for the analysis 
and display of earth science data. GrADS is implemented on all commonly 
available UNIX workstations, Apple Macintosh, and DOS or Linux based PCs, and 
is freely available via anonymous ftp. GrADS provides an integrated environment 
for access, manipulation, and display of earth science data in several forms, 
including GRIB and netCDF. For more information, see theGrADS User's Guide. 
<p></p> 
<h2>Gri</h2> Gri is an extensible plotting language for producing scientific 
graphs, such as x-y plots, contour plots, and image plots. Dan Kelley of 
Dalhousie University is the author of Gri, which can read data from netCDF 
files as well as ASCII and native binary data. For more information on Gri, see 
the URLhttp://gri.sourceforge.net/. 
<p></p> 
<h2>GXSM</h2> The GXSM is the Gnome X Scanning Microscopy project, it is a bit 
more than just a piece of software (the GXSM itself), there is full hardware 
support for DSP cards including open source DSP software and a growing set of 
SPM related electronics. For more information, seehttp://gxsm.sourceforge.net/. 
<p></p> 
<h2>HDF interface</h2> The National Center for Supercomputing Applications 
(NCSA) has added the netCDF interface to theirHierarchical Data Format (HDF) 
software. HDF is an extensible data format for self-describing files. A 
substantial set of applications and utilities based on HDF is available; these 
support raster-image manipulation and display and browsing through 
multidimensional scientific data. An implementation is now available that 
provides the netCDF interface to HDF. With this software, it is possible to use 
the netCDF calling interface to place data into an HDF file. The netCDF calling 
interface has not changed and netCDF files stored in XDR format are readable, 
so existing programs and data will still be usable (although programs will need 
to be relinked to the new library). There is currently no support for the 
mixing of HDF and netCDF structures. For example, a raster image can exist in 
the same file as a netCDF object, but you have to use the Raster Image 
interface to read the image and the netCDF interface to read the netCDF object. 
The other HDF interfaces are currently being modified to allow multi-file 
access, closer integration with the netCDF interface will probably be delayed 
until the end of that project.
<p>Eventually, it will be possible to integrate netCDF objects with the rest 
of the HDF tool suite. Such an integration will then allow tools written for 
netCDF and tools written for HDF to both interact intelligently with the new 
data files.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>HDF-EOS to netCDF converter</h2> 
<p> The Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) 
has developed an on-the-fly HDF-EOS to netCDF/CF converter for the following 
products, making them easier to use in theUnidata IDV and McIDAS-V: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>AIRS Level 2 (scene) profiles of moisture, air temperature and trace gases
</li> 
<li>AIRS Level 3 (global grid) profiles of moisture, air temperature and trace 
gases</li> 
<li>OMI UV-B at the surface</li> 
<li>TOMS ozone and aerosols</li> </ul> 
<p> Instructions are available for searching and converting these data. More 
information on AIRS products is available at
http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/index.html. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>HIPHOP</h2> HIPHOP, developed by Dominik Brunner, is a widget based IDL 
application that largely facilitates the visualization and analysis of 2D, 3D, 
and 4D atmospheric science data, in particular atmospheric tracer distributions 
and meteorological fields.
<p>Graphical output of (atmospheric model) data can be quickly generated in a 
large number of different ways, including horizontal maps at selected model or 
pressure levels, vertical north-south, east-west, or slant cross-sections 
(including zonal averages), time slices, animations, etc. It also allows 
mathematical operations on the existing fields to generate new fields for 
further analysis, and it can be run as a batch application.</p> 
<p>The program handles data in netCDF, HDF and GRIB format. Interfaces to 
other data formats (e.g. ASCII and binary data) can be added easily.</p> 
<p>Beginning with Version 4.0, it also supports the ability to overlay 
meteorological fields on a number of different satellite images, and to draw 
air parcel trajectories.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Hyperslab OPerator Suite (HOPS)</h2> Hyperslab OPerator Suite ( HOPS), 
developed by R. Saravanan at NCAR, is a bilingual, multi-platform software 
package for processing data in netCDF files conforming to the NCAR-CCM format 
or the NCAR Ocean Model format. HOPS is implemented inIDL, the widely-used 
commercial interpreted language, and also inYorick, a public-domain interpreted 
language that is freely available from the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory. The IDL version of HOPS should run on any platform supported by 
IDL. The Yorick version too runs on most common UNIX platforms, such as Sun, 
SGI, Cray, and LINUX computers.
<p>HOPS is not a monolithic program, but a suite of operators that act on data 
units called &quot;hyperslabs&quot;. The design of HOPS is object-oriented, 
rather than procedure-oriented; the operators treat the numeric data and the 
associated meta-data (like coordinate information) as a single object.</p> 
<p>Note that HOPS is not a general purpose netCDF utility and works only for 
the NCAR CSM netCDF formats. For more information, check theHOPS home page.</p>

<h2>iCDF (imports chromatographic netCDF data into MATLAB)</h2> 
<p> Klavs M. S&oslash;rensen, Thomas Skov and Rasmus Bro (Faculty of Life 
Sciences, University of Copenhagen) have developediCDF, a free and documented 
toolbox for importing chromatographic data in the netCDF-based format that most 
manufacturers of chromatographic software support.</p> 
<p> The iCDF software is currently for XC-MS data (X: GC, LC, HPLC), but soon 
it will be able to import data using other detectors as well. It can be used to 
open netCDF files from many different instruments (e.g. Agilent, Bruker) and 
many chromatographic software packages (e.g. ChemStation).</p> 
<p> For more information, see the paper </p>

<h2>IDV (Integrated Data Viewer)</h2> 
<p> Unidata's Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) is a Java application (for Java 1.4 
or later) that can be used to display a variety of netCDF files, particularly 
well formatted, geolocated datasets. Features include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Access to local and remote netCDF files and a variety of other data formats
</li> 
<li>Slicing and probing of multidimensional data</li> 
<li>Support for netCDF conventions (CF, COARDS, NUWG, AWIPS)</li> 
<li>InstallAnywhere installers for easy download and installation</li> 
<li>Save display state to a bundle for easy recreation of views</li> 
<li>Support for non-gridded data through the Common Data Model (CDM)</li> </ul>
 The IDV uses theVisAD Java library for interactive and collaborative 
visualization and analysis and thenetCDF Java library for reading and 
manipulating netCDF files.

<h2>Ingrid</h2> 
<p> Ingrid, by M. Benno Blumenthal &lt;benno@ldeo.columbia.edu&gt;, is 
designed to manipulate large datasets and model input/output. It can read data 
from its data catalog, a netCDF file, or a directly attached model, and output 
the data, either by feeding it to a model, creating a netCDF file, or creating 
plots and other representations of the data.</p> 
<p>Ingrid has a number of filters which allow simple data manipulations, such 
as adding two datasets together, smoothing, averaging, and regridding to a new 
coordinate. In addition to netCDF, it also reads HDF, CDF, VOGL, and SGI GL.</p>
<p>Ingrid is currently running as a WWW daemon that can be accessed through 
http://rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu/datacatalog.html to see some of its 
capabilities on a climate data catalog maintained by theClimate Group of the 
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. To quote the 
introduction:</p> 
<blockquote> The Data Catalog is both a catalog and a library of datasets, 
i.e. it both helps you figure out which data you want, and helps you work with 
the data. The interface allows you to make plots, tables, and files from any 
dataset, its subsets, or processed versions thereof.
<p>This data server is designed to make data accessible to people using WWW 
clients (viewers) and to serve as a data resource for WWW documents. Since most 
documents cannot use raw data, the server is able to deliver the data in a 
variety of ways: as data files (netCDF and HDF), as tables (html), and in a 
variety of plots (line, contour, color, vector) and plot formats (PostScript 
and gif). Processing of the data, particularly averaging, can be requested as 
well.</p> 
<p>The Data Viewer in particular demonstrates the power of the Ingrid daemon.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Ingrid currently runs on Linux, for which binaries are available. CVS 
access to the current source can be arranged.</p>

<h2> Intel Array Visualizer</h2> 
<p> The Intel&reg; Array Visualizer and Intel&reg; Array Viewer are available 
asfree downloads for Windows platforms. They offer an application and a set of 
software tools and components, which include C, Fortran, and .Net libraries, 
for developing scientific visualization applications and for creating 
interactive graphs of array data in various formats, including HDF and netCDF.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>IVE</h2> 
<p> IVE (Interactive Visualization Environment) is a software package designed 
to interactively display and analyze gridded data. IVE assumes the data to be 
displayed are contained in one- two-, three- or four-dimensional arrays. By 
default, the numbers within these arrays are assumed to represent grid point 
values of some field variable (such as pressure) on a rectangular evenly spaced 
grid. IVE is, nevertheless, capable of displaying data on arbitrary curvilinear 
grids.</p> 
<p>If the data points are not evenly spaced on a rectangular grid, IVE must be 
informed of the grid structure, either by specifying &quot;attributes&quot; in 
the data input or by specifying the coordinate transform in a user supplied 
subroutine. Stretched rectangular grids (which occur when the stretching along 
a given coordinate is a function only of the value of that coordinate) can be 
accommodated by specifying one-dimensional arrays containing the grid-point 
locations along the stretched coordinate as part of the IVE input data. 
Staggered meshes can also be accommodated by setting &quot;attributes&quot; in 
the input data. The structure of more complicated curvilinear grids must be 
communicated to IVE via user supplied &quot;transforms,&quot; which define the 
mapping between physical space and the array indices.</p> 
<p>Since four-dimensional data cannot be directly displayed on a flat computer 
screen, it is necessary to reduced the dimensionality of the data before it is 
displayed. One of IVE's primary capabilities involves dimension reduction or 
&quot;data slicing.&quot; IVE allows the user to display lower-dimensional 
subsets of the data by fixing a coordinate or by averaging over the coordinate.
</p> 
<p>IVE currently has the capability to display</p> 
<ul> 
<li>scalar fields as 
<ul> 
<li>2D scalar plots</li> 
<li>1D scalar plots</li> 
<li>vertical soundings</li> 
<li>a single point value</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>vector fields as 2D vector plots</li> </ul> 
<p>IVE lets you overlay plots, loop plots, and control a wide variety of 
display parameters.</p> 
<p>IVE also can perform algebraic computations on the gridded data and can 
calculate derivatives. More complicated computations can be performed in user 
supplied subroutines.</p> 
<p>IVE uses NetCDF for the data input format, and uses the NCAR Graphics 
Library to produce graphical output. IVE is available as source via anonymous 
ftp; and as binary on request for licensees of NCAR graphics.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>JSON format with the ncdump-json utility</h2> 
<p> Josep Llodr&agrave; has developed a program to output the contents of a 
netCDF-3 or netCDF-4 file in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). It is based on 
Unidata's NCDUMP utility, and it keeps the original ncdump functionality, 
unless the &quot;-j&quot; option is used to specify JSON output.</p> 
<p> The program and source are available from 
https://github.com/jllodra/ncdump-json . </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Java interface</h2> 
<p> The NetCDF-Java 4.2 Library is a Java interface to netCDF files, as well 
as to many other types of scientific data formats. It is freely available and 
the source code is released under the (MIT-style) netCDF C library license. 
Previous versions use the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).</p> 
<p> The library implements a Common Data Model (CDM), a generalization of the 
netCDF, OpenDAP and HDF5 data models. The library is a prototype for the 
netCDF-4 project, which provides a C language API for the &quot;data access 
layer&quot; of the CDM, on top of the HDF5 file format. The NetCDF-Java library 
is a 100% Java framework for<em>reading</em> netCDF and other file formats into 
the CDM, as well as<em>writing</em> to the netCDF-3 file format. The library 
also implementsNcML, which allows you to add metadata to CDM datasets, as well 
as to create virtual datasets through aggregation.</p> 
<h2>Kst (2D plotting tool)</h2> 
<p> Kst is an open-source, cross-platform 2D plotting tool focused on 
performance and ease of use. Packages for Windows, various Linux distributions 
and Mac OS X are available, as well as the complete source code and cmake-based 
build files. A more detailed presentation of Kst can be found on the web page at
http://kst-plot.kde.org, including numerous screenshots and all the useful 
download links.</p> 
<h2>Labview interface</h2> 
<p> A netCDF Labview interface, implemented in the Labview programming 
language is available. The software includes A graphical user interface for 
editing netCDF data and conversion to other data formats. The package was 
developed and is maintained by L. F. Hwang of Sun Yat-sen University in China. 
For more information and to download the source code, see theNetCDFLabview web 
site. </p> 
<h2>MBDyn (MultiBody Dynamics)</h2> 
<p> MBDyn is an open-source MultiBody Dynamics analysis system developed at 
the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale of the University &quot;Politecnico 
di Milano&quot;, Italy. It uses netCDF as its primary output format.</p> 
<p> MBDyn features the integrated multidisciplinary analysis of multibody, 
multiphysics systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and flexible 
constrained bodies, smart materials, electric networks, active control, 
hydraulic networks, essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft aerodynamics. It allows 
users to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous mechanical, aero-servo-elastic 
systems based on first principles equations. It is being actively developed and 
used in the aerospace and automotive fields for dynamics analysis and 
simulation of complex systems. Dynamic linking of user-defined modules is 
heavily exploited to let users extend the feature library.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Max_diff_nc</h2> 
<p> This is a program which compares two NetCDF files. Variables with the same 
ID in the two files are assumed to be of the same type and have the same shape. 
For each such couple of variables, the program computes the maximum of the 
absolute value of the difference, and the maximum of the absolute value of the 
relative difference. The program also tells you at what location (the subscript 
list of the array) the maximum difference is reached.</p> 
<p>The web page for this program is: 
http://web.lmd.jussieu.fr/~lglmd/Max_diff_nc </p> 
<p>This is a freely available tool. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>MeteoInfo</h2> 
<p> Dr. Ya-Qiang Wang, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, has 
developed theMeteoInfo application to view and analyze meteorological and 
spatial data. It includes support for reading netCDF grid data. Auser guide is 
also available with examples.</p> 
<p> MeteoInfo is freely available software designed to view and analyze 
meteorological and spatial data interactively. Some GIS functions were 
developed from ground level. It was developed with C# in the Microsoft .Net 
environment. MeteoInfo may be run in Windows with .NetFramework 3.5, or in UNIX 
like systems withMono, an open source implementation of the .NET Framework.

<h2>MexEPS</h2> PMEL has developed a MATLAB interface, MexEPS, which supports 
several netCDF file conventions, including those adopted by PMEL. Many styles 
of time axes are supported and time manipulation routines ease the use of the 
time axis in MATLAB. The MexEPS package supports the following data formats:
<ul> 
<li>reading, writing and editing netCDF files;</li> 
<li>reading and writing Classic EPIC files</li> 
<li>reading formatted ASCII files</li> </ul> It includes: 
<ul> 
<li>VARIABLE, AXIS, ATTRIBUTE manipulation routines</li> 
<li>TIME manipulation 
<ul> 
<li>TIME enters MATLAB as YYMMDDhhmmss.fff</li> 
<li>Can be converted to netCDF udunits time convention (e.g. days <i>since</i> 
1990-01-01 00:00:00)</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>MATLAB help and example scripts using MexEPS</li> 
<li><b>ASCII2MAT</b> mexFunction, which reads a formatted file into MATLAB as

<h2>MEXNC and SNCTOOLS</h2> 
<p> John Evans of Rutgers University maintains MEXNC and developed SNCTOOLS. 
MEXNC is a mexfile interface to NetCDF files for MATLAB that has roughly a 
one-to-one equivalence with the C API for netCDF.SNCTOOLS is a set of 
higher-level m-files that sit atop MEXNC, shielding the user from such low 
level netCDF details as file IDs, variable IDs, and dimension IDs. The general 
philosophy behind SNCTOOLS is providing the ability to read and write data 
without trying to invent a new syntax.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Mirone (Windows MATLAB-based display)</h2> 
<p>Joaquim Luis of Universidade do Algarve has developed Mirone, a Windows 
MATLAB-based framework tool that allows the display and manipulation of a large 
number of grid/images formats through its interface with theGDAL library. Its 
main purpose is to provide users with an easy-to-use graphical interface to 
manipulateGMT grids. In addition it offers a wide range of tools dedicated to 
topics in the earth sciences, including tools for multibeam mission planning, 
elastic deformation studies, tsunami propagation modeling, earth magnetic field 
computations and magnetic Parker inversions, Euler rotations and poles 
computations, plate tectonic reconstructions, and seismicity and focal 
mechanism plotting. The high quality mapping and cartographic capabilities for 
which GMT is renowned is guaranteed through Mirone's ability to automatically 
generate GMT cshell scripts and dos batch files.</p> 
<p> Although Mirone is written in Matlab, a stand-alone version to run under 
Windows is also provided. Regrettably this version is not as efficient as the 
native Matlab code but provides a solution for users that don't have Matlab.</p>

<h2>nccmp</h2> 
<p> Remik Ziemlinski of the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory has 
developednccmp, a tool to compare two netCDF files. It can use MPI, 
include/exclude specific variables or metadata and operates quickly. Highly 
recommended for regression testing with large datasets. See the Web site
http://nccmp.sourceforge.net/ for more information. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>NCL</h2> 
<p> The Visualization and Enabling Technologies Section of NCAR's Scientific 
Computing Division has developed the NCAR Command Language (NCL), an intepreted 
programming language for scientific data analysis and visualization.</p> 
<p> NCL has many features common to modern programming languages, including 
types, variables, operators, expressions, conditional statements, loops, and 
functions and procedures. NCL also has features that are not found in other 
programming languages, including those that handle the manipulation of 
metadata, the configuration of visualizations, the import of data from a 
variety of data formats, and an algebra that supports array operations.</p> 
<p> NCL has robust file input and output capabilities. It allows different 
datasets of different formats (netCDF, netCDF4 classic, HDF4, HDF4-EOS, GRIB-1, 
and GRIB-2) to be imported into one uniform and consistent data manipulation 
environment, which internally is the netCDF data format. NCL doesn't place any 
restrictions or conventions on the organization of input netCDF files.</p> 
<p> NCL comes with many useful built-in functions and procedures for 
processing and manipulating data. There are over 600 functions and procedures 
that include routines for use specifically with climate and model data 
computing, empirical orthogonal functions, Fourier coefficients, wavelets, 
singular value decomposition, 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional interpolation, 
approximation, and regridding, and computer analysis of scalar and vector 
global geophysical quantities.</p> 
<p> The visualizations are publication-quality and highly customizable, with 
hundreds of options available for tweaking the looks of your graphics. NCL can 
generate contours, XY plots, vectors, streamlines, and can overlay these plots 
on many different map projections. There are also specialized functions for 
generating histograms, wind roses, meteograms, skew-T plots, weather maps.</p> 
<p>Included with the software are two command line tools: 
&quot;ncl_convert2nc&quot; for converting GRIB-1/2 or HDF files to netCDF 
files, and &quot;ncl_filedump&quot; which will dump the contents of a file 
format that NCL recognizes (netCDF, GRIB-1/2, HDF, etc).</p> 
<p> NCL is available under an open source license or in binary form for 
several popular UNIX platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, MacOSX, 
and Windows/Cygwin.</p> 
<p> Documentation and additional information on NCL are available from the NCL 
website, which contains hundreds of application examples for one to download.

<h2>NCO</h2> NCO (netCDF operators) is a package of command line operators 
that work on generic netCDF or HDF4 files:
<ul> 
<li>ncap2 - arithmetic processor</li> 
<li>ncatted - attribute editor</li> 
<li>ncbo - binary operator</li> 
<li>ncdiff - differencer</li> 
<li>ncea - ensemble averager</li> 
<li>ncecat - ensemble concatenator</li> 
<li>ncflint - file interpolator</li> 
<li>ncks - kitchen sink (extract, cut, paste, print data)</li> 
<li>ncpdq - permute dimensions quickly</li> 
<li>ncra - running averager</li> 
<li>ncrcat - record concatenator</li> 
<li>ncrename - renamer</li> 
<li>ncwa - weighted averager</li> </ul> 
<p>All operators may now be OPeNDAP clients. OPeNDAP enables network 
transparent data access to any OPeNDAP server. Thus OPeNDAP-enabled NCO can 
operate on remote files accessible through any OPeNDAP server without 
transferring the files. Only the required data (e.g., the variable or hyperslab 
specified) are transferred.</p> 
<p>The source code is freely available from the NCO home page, as is the NCO 
User's Guide.</p>

<h2>ncregrid</h2> 
<p> Patrick J&ouml;ckel of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry has developed
<strong>ncregrid</strong>, a tool (written in FORTRAN-90) for data transfer of 
gridded 2- and 3-dimensional (spatial) geophysical/geochemical scalar fields 
between grids of different resolutions. The algorithm handles data on 
rectangular latitude/longitude grids (not necessarily evenly spaced) and 
vertical pressure hybrid grids of arbitrary resolution. The input/output data 
format is netCDF. ncregrid is freely available without any warranty under the 
GNU public license (GPL). ncregrid can be used as a &quot;stand-alone&quot; 
program, and/or linked as an interface to a model, in order to re-grid 
automatically the input from an arbitrary grid space onto the required grid 
resolution.</p>

<h2>nctoolbox (a MATLAB common data model interface)</h2> 
<p> Brian Schlining (MBARI) has developed nctoolbox, a read-only Matlab 
interface forCommon Data Model datasets, allowing access to NetCDF, OpenDAP, 
and HDF5 datasets using the same API. This toolkit uses the Unidata NetCDF-Java 
(version 4.0) implementation under the hood. It has been tested with Matlab 
versions 2008a, 2008b, 2009a, and 2009b.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>ncdx</h2> 
<p> Patrick J&ouml;ckel of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry has developed
<strong>ncdx</strong>, a tool (written in FORTRAN-90) that scans a netCDF file 
and makes itOpenDX compliant. ncdx is freely available without any warranty 
under the GNU public license (GPL). More information is available on the 
web-page: http://www.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/~joeckel/ncdx/index.html. </p>

<h2>ncensemble</h2> 
<p> Alan Iwi, of Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, offers this command line 
ensemble statistics utility. More information is available on the web-page: 
http://home.badc.rl.ac.uk/iwi/ncensemble/. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>ncview</h2> Ncview is a visual browser for netCDF files. Typically you 
would use ncview to get a quick and easy, push-button look at your netCDF 
files. You can view simple movies of the data, view along various dimensions, 
take a look at the actual data values, change color maps, invert the data, etc. 
It runs on UNIX platforms under X11, R4 or higher. For more information, check 
out theREADME file; you can also see a representative screen image (GIF, 66K) 
of ncview in action.

<h2>NetCDF Toolbox for MATLAB-5</h2> The NetCDF Toolbox for MATLAB-5, 
originally developed by Charles R. Denham, combined netCDF-3 withMATLAB to form 
an interface that used MATLAB operator-syntax for arithmetic, logical, and 
subscripting operations on netCDF entities. The NetCDF Toolbox is in 
bug-fix-only mode, and is maintained by John.G.Evans.NE@gmail.com, on the 
MEXNC, SNCTOOLS, and the NetCDF Toolbox web page. 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>ncvtk</h2> 
<p> Ncvtk is a program for exploring planetary data stored in a NetCDF file. 
The NetCDF file should loosely follow theCF metadata conventions. </p> 
<p> Ncvtk was designed from the ground up with the aim of offering a high 
degree of interactivity to scientists who have a need to explore structured, 
three-dimensional, time-dependent climate data on the sphere. A graphical user 
interface allows users to interact with their data via 
color/transparency/contour/vector plots, apply vertical slices, probe data, 
apply an external sun light, overlay hydrographic and geopolitical data, 
rotate, zoom, etc. with minimal fuss.</p> 
<p> Ncvtk is written in python and is based on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK)
. Like python and VTK, Ncvtk is highly portable and known to run on Windows and 
Linux (i386, ia64, EMT64) platforms. More information about Ncvtk is available 
athttp://ncvtk.sourceforge.net. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>NetCDF-Java Toolbox for MATLAB</h2> 
<p> The NJ toolbox (njTBX) was developed by Rich Signell (USGS) and Sachin 
Bhate (Mississippi State) to make it easier for Matlab users to harness the 
power of the NetCDF-Java Library from Unidata.</p> 
<p> By implementing the Common Data Model (a generalization of the NetCDF, 
OpenDAP and HDF5 data models) it can read both local and remote NetCDF-3 and 
NetCDF-4 files, data from OPeNDAP and ADDE servers, as well as GRIB, GRIB2, 
HDF4, HDF5, BUFR, URF and TDWR files. It can also read &quot;virtual 
datasets&quot; constructed using the NetCDF Markup Language. Thus njTBX 
complements and extends both the older ncmex-based toolkits as well as the 
newer Matlab 2008b+ built-in toolbox for NetCDF.</p> 
<p> njTBX uses only Java and M-files, thus should work on any version of 
Matlab that supports Java (Matlab 6.5 and later) and on any platform. The 
library is freely available and the source code is released under an MIT-style 
library license.</p> 
<p>For another similar package, see nctoolbox.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Ivan Shmakov's netcdf tools</h2> 
<p> The NetCDF tools is a free software package consisting of a few tools 
operating on NetCDF and, by utilizing the compatibility API, HDF4 files, which 
are intended to be usable from Shell scripts.</p> 
<p> The currently packaged tools are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>a couple of simple shell wrappers over the respective NetCDF functions 
(ncattget and ncattput);</li> 
<li>a more sophisticated ncget tool.</li> </ul> 
<p> The ncget tool implements functionalilty that is similar to hdp dumpsds 
(for NetCDF, which lacks such a tool), or complements it in the case of HDF4. 
It can be seen as a complement to the ncdump tool (included in both the NetCDF 
and HDF4 distributions) as well.</p> 
<p> This tool allows a selected part of a NetCDF variable or an HDF4 
scientific data set (SDS) to be extracted in either an ASCII or binary form, 
applying the transformation specified by the usual scale_factor and add_offset 
attributes. It allows one to feed the data contained in NetCDF variables (or 
HDF4 SDS) to the tools designed to operate on either ASCII (text) or raw 
(binary) data.</p> 
<p> This version of the package is the first one to be announced to the 
public. It has some known bugs and limitations, but it's proved to be quite 
usable. Aproject page on freshmeat.net. The source is also available. </p> 
<h2>netcdf4excel (add-in for MS Excel)</h2> 
<p> Alexander Bruhns  has developed a netCDF add-in written in Visual Basic 
for MS Excel. This add-in simplifies the use of NetCDF data in Excel, providing 
a ready to use solution for manipulating this type of data.</p> 
<p> For developers, the open-source (GPL V3 license) can be downloaded 
directly or checked out with Mercurial.</p> 
<p> The add-in is written in VBA 6.0 (so it won't work with Office 2010 64 
bits) and is designed for Excel 2007 running with the Microsoft Windows 
operating system. It supports opening netCDF classic format data with Excel for 
read or write access.</p> 
<p>More details are available on the netcdf4excel web site</p>. 
<p> </p> 
<h2>NetCDF95 alternative Fortran API</h2> 
<p> Lionel Guez has developed and made feely available NetCDF95, a new 
alternative Fortran interface to the NetCDF library. Compared to the 
Unidata-provided Fortran 90 netCDF interface, the NetCDF95 interface is meant 
to be easier to use and more secure.</p> 
<h2>Objective-C API</h2> 
<p>Tom Moore has an Objective-C API, available here: 
www.paleoterra.com/software. The netCDF Framework is an open source (Argonne 
Open Source License) MacOSX application framework that provides an Objective-C 
interface to the NCAR netCDF library version 3. The framework is available both 
as source code and universal compiles (works on both PPC and Intel macs). The 
source code has also been compiled by users for the GNUStep environment. 
Version 2 of the framework will provide classes for accessing multiple netCDF 
files, working with in-memory data slabs using standard notation, and some 
support for multithreading.</p> 
<h3>Mark Tracy's Objective-C API</h3> 
<p>Mark Tracy has written NetcdfStep, an Objective-C API for netCDF that uses 
Objective-C Foundation Classes.</p> 
<p> NetcdfStep is framework for using the netCDF library in object-oriented 
programming with Objective-C. It now supports the full functionality of netCDF 
3.6.2.</p> 
<p> A  complete Mac OS X distribution including pre-built static library and 
online documentation are available. Applications linked to this framework have 
no external dependencies (other than Mac OS X itself). A source-code only 
distribution synced up to version 0.6.1 is available for GNUstep for use on 
Linux and other Unix platforms.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Octave interface</h2> 
<p> The ARM Program has contributed NCMEX for Octave, a port of Chuck Denham's 
Matlab NCMEX toOctave. The calling syntax is identical, so scripts using NCMEX 
in Matlab should in theory be portable to Octave. In order to build NCMEX, a 
compiled C NetCDF library must already be installed.</p> 
<p> In addition to the base NetCDF library interface, this package includes a 
simple toolbox to automate the reading and writing of NetCDf files within 
Octave using NCMEX. These tools as well as the source for NCMEX are available 
from http://engineering.arm.gov/~sbeus/octavex/octavex.tar (NOTE: this .tar 
file contains other Octave extension functions besides NCMEX.)</p> 
<p> Also see Octcdf, a netCDF toolbox for Octave. </p> 
<p> For installation instructions, see the README file inside the .tar file. 
</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Octave interface (Barth)</h2> 
<p>Alexander Barth has contributed the following:</p> 
<p> Octcdf is a netCDF toolbox for Octave which uses the same operator syntax 
as thematlab netCDF toolbox of Charles R. Denham. NetCDF dimensions, attributes 
and variables are Octave objects and can be accessed, sliced and changed just 
as regular variables. Unlike most netCDF toolboxes for matlab, it does not 
depend on the NCMEX wrapper around the netCDF interface. This octave toolbox is 
written in C++ calling directly the netCDF library. The octcdf toolbox can also 
be used to download data from an OpenDAP server. The octcdf source code is 
available at 
http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/index.php/NetCDF_toolbox_for_Octave. It was 
also included in the Octave Repositoryoctave-forge. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>OPeNDAP (formerly DODS)</h2> 
<p>The OPeNDAP (formerly known as DODS) is an Open-source Project for a 
Network Data Access Protocol that makes local data and subsets of local data 
accessible to remote locations independent of the local storage format. OPeNDAP 
also provides tools for transforming existing applications into OPeNDAP 
clients, enabling them to remotely access OPeNDAP served data. OPeNDAP is based 
on existing data access tools; rather than developing a self contained system, 
it makes extensive use of existing data access APIs.</p> 
<p>OPeNDAP can be used to make netCDF data files available over the Internet 
and it can also be used to adapt existing software which use the netCDF API (by 
re-linking) to read data served by an OPeNDAP data server. In principle, any 
program written using netCDF can be adapted to read data from an OPeNDAP server 
- in other words any program which uses netCDF can become a client in the 
OPeNDAP client-server system. Included in the source and binary distributions 
are two freely available programs that have already been modified (re-linked).
</p> 
<p>With a client program accessing data from a netCDF server, it is possible 
to access a small subset of a large dataset over the Internet without copying 
the entire dataset (as you would have to do with FTP or AFS). The client can 
see changes to the netCDF dataset, e.g. when new records are added (which would 
not be possible with FTP). Finally, the client can also access cross-sections 
of variable data without paging large amounts of data across the network (as 
you would have to do with NFS, for example).</p> 
<p>OPeNDAP software is freely available in both source form or binary form for 
selected platforms.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>OpenDX</h2> OpenDX (formerly IBM Data Explorer, also known as simply DX) 
is a general-purpose software package for data visualization and analysis. It 
employs a data-flow driven client-server execution model and provides a 
graphical program editor that allows the user to create a visualization using a 
point and click interface.
<p>DX runs on 7 major UNIX platforms as well as Windows 95/NT and is designed 
to take full advantage of multi-processor systems from IBM, SGI and Sun.</p> 
<p>DX is built upon an internal data model, which describes and provides 
uniform access services for any data brought into, generated by, or exported 
from the software. This data model supports a number of different classes of 
scientific data, which can be described by their shape (size and number of 
dimensions), rank (e.g., scalar, vector, tensor), type (float, integer, byte, 
etc. or real, complex, quaternion), where the data are located in space 
(positions), how the locations are related to each other (connections), 
aggregates or groups (e.g., hierarchies, series, composites, multizone grids, 
etc.). It also supports those entities required for graphics and imaging 
operations within the context of Data Explorer. Regular and irregular, deformed 
or curvilinear, structured and unstructured data as well as &quot;missing&quot; 
or invalid data are supported.</p> 
<p>The details of the data model are hidden at the user level. As a result DX 
operations or modules are polymorphic and appear typeless. The DX Import 
module, which reads data for use within Data Explorer directly utilizes data in 
netCDF as well as other formats (e.g., HDF, CDF). One or more variables may be 
selected as well as step(s) of a time series. Data in conventional netCDFs are 
directly imported. Since the DX data model is more comprehensive than the 
netCDF data model, a methodology to extend netCDF via attribute conventions 
(e.g., for unstructured meshes, non-scalar data and hierarchies) for use with 
Data Explorer is available.</p> 
<p>DX supports a number of realization techniques for generating renderable 
geometry from data. These include color and opacity mapping (e.g., for surface 
and volume rendering), contours and isosurfaces, histograms, two-dimensional 
and three-dimensional plotting, surface deformation, etc. for scalar data. For 
vector data, arrow plots, streamlines, streaklines, etc. are provided. 
Realizations may be annotated with ribbons, tubes, axes, glyphs, text and 
display of data locations, meshes and boundaries. Data probing, picking, 
arbitrary surface and volume sampling, and arbitrary cutting/mapping planes are 
supported.</p> 
<p>DX supports a number of non-graphical functions such as point-wise 
mathematical expressions (e.g., arithmetic, transcendental, boolean, type 
conversion, etc.), univariate statistics and image processing (e.g., 
transformation, filter, warp, edge detection, convolution, equalization, 
blending, morphological operations, etc.). Field/vector operations such as 
divergence, gradient and curl, dot and cross products, etc. are provided. 
Non-gridded or scattered data may be interpolated to an arbitrary grid or 
triangulated, depending on the analysis requirements. The length, area or 
volume of various geometries may also be computed. Tools for data manipulation 
such as removal of data points, subsetting by position, sub/supersampling, grid 
construction, mapping, interpolation, regridding, transposition, etc. are 
available.</p> 
<p>Tools for doing cartographic projections and registration as well as earth, 
space and environmental sciences examples are available at Cornell University 
via info.tc.cornell.edu. Also see thencdx tool for making netCDF files OpenDX 
compliant.</p>

<h2>Panoply</h2> 
<p> Panoply is an application that plots longitude-latitude and 
latitude-vertical gridded data from netCDF and HDF data. Features include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Slice specific latitude-longitude, latitude-vertical, or time-latitude 
arrays from multidimensional variables.</li> 
<li>Two arrays may be combined in one plot by differencing, summing, or 
averaging.</li> 
<li>Lon-lat data may be plotted as global maps (using any of over 75 map 
projections) or as zonal average plots.</li> 
<li>Overlay continent outlines or masks on lon-lat plots.</li> 
<li>Use your favorite CPT, GGR, PAL, or ACT color table for scale colorbar.
</li> 
<li>Save plots to disk in GIF, PDF, PNG or PS form.</li> </ul> 
<p> Panoply requires that your computer have a Java 5 runtime environment, or 
better, installed.</p> 
<p> Panoply is developed at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. 
Questions and suggestions should be directed toDr. Robert B. Schmunk. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Parallel-NetCDF</h2> 
<p> A group of researchers at Northwestern University and Argonne National 
Laboratory (Jianwei Li, Wei-keng Liao, Alok Choudhary, Robert Ross, Rajeev 
Thakur, William Gropp, and Rob Latham) have designed and implemented a new 
parallel interface for writing and reading netCDF data, tailored for use on 
high performance platforms with parallel I/O. The implementation builds on the 
MPI-IO interface, providing portability to most platforms in use and allowing 
users to leverage the many optimizations built into MPI-IO implementations. 
Testing so far has been on Linux platforms with ROMIO and IBM SP machines using 
IBM's MPI.</p> 
<p> Documentation and code for Parallel-NetCDF is now available for testing. 
Although a few interfaces are not implemented yet, the current implementation 
is complete enough to provide significant I/O performance improvements on 
parallel platforms, as described in atechnical report. Users are invited to 
test Parallel-NetCDF in their applications.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Paraview and vtkCSCSNetCDF</h2> 
<p>http://www.paraview.org/ </p> 
<p>ParaView is an application designed with the need to visualize large data 
sets in mind. The goals of the ParaView project include the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization application. </li> 
<li>Support distributed computation models to process large data sets. </li> 
<li>Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface. </li> 
<li>Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards. </li> </ul> 
<p>ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as single 
processor systems and has been successfully tested on Windows, Linux and 
various Unix workstations and clusters. Under the hood, ParaView uses the 
Visualization Toolkit as the data processing and rendering engine and has a 
user interface written using a unique blend of Tcl/Tk and C++.</p> 
<p>vtkCSCSNetCDF is a vtk/ParaView reader class for netCDF files. It can be 
foundhere </p> 
<p>The key features of vtkCSCSNetCDF are </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reads most netCDF files </li> 
<li>Supports parallel read of data when used in conjunction with ParaView </li>
<li>Creates vtkUnstructuredGrid for data with boundary cell geometry </li> 
<li>Creates vtkRectilinearGrid for data with no boundary cell geometry but 
with dimension arrays</li> 
<li>Creates vtkUniformGrid for data with sizes but no dimension variables 
(i.e. regular in all dimensions)</li> 
<li>Supports files with multiple time steps </li> </ul> 
<h2>Perl interfaces</h2> There are two netCDF interfaces for Perl: 
<ul> 
<li>  PDL::NetCDF, Doug Hunt's perl interface which uses the PDL (perl data 
language) extension.</li> 
<li> NetCDFPerl, Steve Emmerson's extension module, based on version 2 of the 
netCDF package. Uses perl lists for representing netCDF variables.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h2>PolyPaint+</h2> PolyPaint+ is an interactive scientific visualization tool 
that displays complex structures within three-dimensional data fields. It 
provides both color shaded-surface display and simple volumetric rendering in 
either index or true color. For shaded surface rendering, the PolyPaint+ 
routines first compute the polygon set that describes a desired surface within 
the 3D data volume. These polygons are then rendered as continuously shaded 
surfaces. PolyPaint+ contains a wide variety of options that control lighting, 
viewing, and shading. Objects rendered volumetrically may be viewed along with 
shaded surfaces. Additional data sets can be overlaid on shaded surfaces by 
color coding the data according to a specified color ramp. 3D visualizations 
can be viewed in stereo for added depth perspective.
<p>Currently supported 3D visualizations are the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Shaded isosurface</li> 
<li>Transparent contour shells or isosurfaces at varying levels</li> 
<li>Volumetric or density plot</li> 
<li>Planes</li> 
<li>Contour ribbons</li> 
<li>Topographic surface from 2D geographic data sets</li> </ul> 
<p>3D data volumes may be sliced in the X, Y, or Z plane using an interactive 
cutting plane. A cross section of the data volume can be viewed in a 2D window 
as a 2D contour plot, a vector plot, a raster image or a combination of these 
options superimposed. Map outlines can be used as a background for 2D cross 
section plots of geographic data. All data is projected according to the 
coordinates specified by the user for the cross section window.</p> 
<p>The user interface provides direct manipulation tools for specifying the 
eye position, center of view, light sources, and color ramps. Subsetting of 
data can be done easily by selecting the data by index or geographic 
coordinate. On-line contextual help provides easy access to more detail about 
the software. Tutorials which range from very simple visualizations to complex 
combinations of data sets provide the user with a quick learning tool.</p> 
<p>Currently PolyPaint+ accepts only data which is in the NetCDF file format. 
A file conversion utility which converts from raw binary data to netCDf is a 
part of the application.</p> 
<p>PolyPaint+ is a joint effort of the University of Colorado and NCAR 
(National Center for Atmospheric Research) funded by the NASA AISRP program. A 
beta version of PolyPaint+ is currently available free of charge using FTP or 
for a nominal fee which would cover tape distribution. A license agreement must 
be signed in order to use it.</p>

<h2>Pomegranate</h2> 
<p> The P9E Team at NASA JPL has developed Pomegranate, a python application 
that &quot;webifies&quot; science data files. Supported formats include netCDF, 
HDF4, HDF5, GRIB and FITS.</p> 
<p> Pomegranate can be installed on web servers as either a WSGI or CGI 
application to provide webification (w10n) services. To learn more about w10n 
of science data files, please visithttp://webification.org/. A brief help 
document describes how to use thedemo directory to browse or download metadata 
or data in netCDF, JSON, or other formats by clicking on data folder and 
document icons.</p> 
<p> Pomegranate can also be used as a standalone library or command line 
application. This greatly simplifies the retrieval of metadata and data from 
files in supported formats.</p> 
<p> Pomegranate is open source software and can be downloaded from  
http://www.openchannelsoftware.com/projects/Pomegranate/. </p> 
<h2>PyNGL and PyNIO</h2> 
<p> NCAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory has developed PyNGL
, a python package for scientific visualization and data analysis andPyNIO, a 
Python package supporting access to a variety of data formats using an 
interface modelled on netCDF.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Python interfaces</h2> 
<p> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented language that is supported on a 
wide range of hardware and operating systems. Python information and sources 
can be obtained fromhttp://www.python.org/. There are now several netCDF 
interfaces for Python.</p> 
<p> Jeff Whitaker of the NOAA Earth System Research Lab has developed a 
netCDF-4 module for python: http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/. Most new 
features of netCDF-4 are implemented, such as multiple unlimited dimensions, 
groups and zlib data compression. All the new numeric data types (such as 
64-bit and unsigned integer types) are implemented. Compound and variable 
length (vlen) data types are supported, but the enum and opaque data types are 
not. Mixtures of compound and vlen data types (compound types containing vlens, 
and vlens containing compound types) are not supported.</p> 
<p> Andr&eacute; Gosselin of the Institut Maurice-Lamontagne, P&eacute;ches 
&amp; Oc&eacute;ans Canada, has implemented pycdf, a new Python interface to 
the netCDF library. It is available fromhttp://pysclint.sourceforge.net/pycdf/, 
where you will find the install files, installation instructions, extensive 
documentation in text and html format, and examples. pycdf requires the Numeric 
python package, and installs through the simple &quot;python setyp.py 
install&quot; command.</p> 
<p>Bill Noon (noon@snow.cit.cornell.edu) has implemented another netCDF Python 
module that allows easy creation, access, and browsing of netCDF data. The 
bindings also use theudunits library to do unit conversions. More information 
and source for Noon's Python netCDF module are available from
http://snow.cit.cornell.edu/noon/ncmodule.html.</p> 
<p>The package from Konrad Hinsen has been integrated into his ScientificPython
 package.</p> 
<p> Dave Brown of NCAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory has 
developedPyNIO, a Python package that allows read and/or write access to a 
variety of data formats using an interface modelled on netCDF. Currently 
supported formats include netCDF, HDF4, GRIB1 and GRIB2 (read only), and 
HDF-EOS 2 Grid and Swath data (read only).</p> 
<p> Vicente Galiano of Miguel Hernandez University has developed a Python 
interface to PnetCDF. This Python's package called &quot;PyPnetCDF&quot; allows 
access to NetCDF files using MPI and the library pnetCDF developed by 
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/parallel-netcdf/. The tools are very similar to Konrad 
Hinsen's NetCDF package to Python but can read and write in a parallel way. For 
more information, see:http://www.pyacts.org/pypnetcdf. </p> 
<p> Pupynere (PUre PYthon NEtcdf REader) Roberto De Almeida has developed 
pupynere, a PUre PYthon NEtcdf REader that allows read-access to netCDF files 
using the same syntax as the Scientific.IO.NetCDF Python module. Even though 
it's written in Python, the module is up to 40% faster than

<h2>R interface</h2> 
<p> The R Project for Statistical Computing has developed  R, a language and 
environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety 
of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear 
modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, and 
clustering.</p> 
<p> David Pierce has contributed the ncdf4 package for reading netCDF data 
into R and for creating new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files, or 
manipulating existing netCDF files from R.</p> 
<p> Pavel Michna has contributed another package, RNetCDF, that also provides 
access to netCDF data and to udunits calendar functions from R.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Ruby interface</h2> 
<p> A group at the Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH) of 
Kyoto University has developed anetCDF interface for Ruby, an interpreted, 
object-oriented scripting language. This interface is intended to cover all the 
functionality of the C library for netCDF. Also available are combination 
functions such as iterators (which offer abstract ways to scan files and 
variables). Numeric arrays are handled by the &quot;NArray&quot; 
multi-dimensional array class, which is becoming the de facto standard 
multi-dimensional array for Ruby. See also the Ruby-basedGPhys software and 
Gfdnavi tool for accessing GRIB, GrADS, and netCDF data uniformly. </p> 
<p> More information about Ruby is available from the Ruby web site. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Scientific DataSet (SDS) Library</h2> 
<p> The Scientific DataSet Library and Tools project, developed jointly by 
Microsoft Research Cambridge and Moscow State University, is aimed at 
manipulation and visualization of multidimensional data sets.</p> 
<p> Scientific DataSet (or SDS in short) is a .NET class library for 
manipulating scientific data and their metadata. SDS provides a unified API for 
convenient access to various data storages. Three types of storages are 
supported by the first release: NetCDF files, CSV text files and volatile 
in-memory datasets. SDS uses native NetCDF library built from version 4.0.1 
both for 32 and 64-bit Windows platforms. New storage types can be added to SDS 
infractructure as plugins. Support for accessing TIFF image files from SDS as 
2D arrays will be available soon as a separate CodePlex project.</p> 
<p> Three applications are built on top of SDS: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>sds command line utility. It allows users to examine data set schema, copy 
data sets, modify their metadata.</li> 
<li>DataSetViewer application for visualization of data sets. DataSetViewer is 
both a standalone application and Windows Presentation Foundation Control that 
can be built into your applications. DataSetViewer has support for interactive 
slicing of multidimensional data along any dimension.</li> 
<li>DataSetEditor add-in for Microsoft Office Excel. DataSetEditor provides 
ability to view and modify the contents of any data set as Excel worksheets.
</li> </ul> 
<p> You can read the Getting Started document at  
http://sds.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?DownloadId=127282 
for a more detailed introduction to the Scientific DataSet software. A Windows 
Installation package for SDS binaries along with DataSet Viewer and DataSet 
Editor are available also. You can also build core class libraries and the sds 
utility under Mono. You may use, copy, and reproduce this software for any 
non-commercial purpose. For further details see license at
http://sds.codeplex.com/license. </p> 
<p> The SDS project is in beta phase and keeps evolving. You are welcome to 
join discussions or report issues at the CodePlex site:http://sds.codeplex.com.

<h2>Tcl/Tk interfaces</h2> 
<p> Dan Schmitt has developed cdftcl, a Tcl/Tk interface for netCDF. It allows 
the use of &quot;wildcards&quot; (*) or ranges (1-4) in the subscript notation, 
and use of name references instead of variable IDs. Contact dan@computer.org 
for more information.</p> 
<h2>Tcl-nap</h2> 
<p> Tcl-nap (n-dimensional array processor) is a loadable extension of Tcl 
which provides a powerful and efficient facility for processing data in the 
form of n-dimensional arrays. It has been designed to provide an 
array-processing facility with much of the functionality of languages such asAPL
, Fortran-90,IDL, J, matlab, and octave. </p> 
<p> Support is provided for data based on n-dimensional grids, where the 
dimensions correspond to continuous spatial coordinates. There are interfaces 
to the HDF and netCDF file formats commonly used for such data, especially in 
Earth sciences such as Oceanography and Meteorology.</p> 
<p> The internal data structure is called a NAO (n-dimensional array object) 
and contains similar information to that of HDF SDSs and netCDF variables.</p> 
<p> Tcl-nap was developed as part of the CSIRO CAPS project, but can be loaded 
and used without the (satellite oriented) CAPS extension.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Visual Basic and VB.net interfaces</h2> 
<p> Carsten Wieczorrek has developed code in VB 6 to export chromatographic 
data into the netcdf/ANDI format. The application writes netCDF files that can 
be read by CHROMELEON, for example. For others interested in programming with 
netcdf.dll from VB 6, see Wieczorrek's web page onnetCDF and VB 6.0 and for 
VB.net, seenetCDF and VB.net. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>VisAD</h2> VisAD is a Java class library for interactive and collaborative 
visualization and analysis of numerical data. It combines:
<ul> 
<li>The use of pure Java for platform independence and to support data sharing 
and real-time collaboration among geographically distributed users. Support for 
distributed computing is integrated at the lowest levels of the system using 
Java RMI distributed objects.</li> 
<li>A general mathematical data model that can be adapted to virtually any 
numerical data, that supports data sharing among different users, different 
data sources and different scientific disciplines, and that provides 
transparent access to data independent of storage format and location (i.e., 
memory, disk or remote). The data model has been adapted to netCDF, FITS, 
HDF-EOS, McIDAS, Vis5D, GIF and JPEG file formats.</li> 
<li>A general display model that supports interactive 3-D, data fusion, 
multiple data views, direct manipulation, collaboration, and virtual reality. 
The display model has been adapted to Java3D and Java2D and used in an 
ImmersaDesk virtual reality display.</li> 
<li>Data analysis and computation integrated with visualization to support 
computational steering and other complex interaction modes.</li> 
<li>Support for two distinct communities: developers who create domain- 
specific systems based on VisAD, and users of those domain-specific systems. 
VisAD is designed to support a wide variety of user interfaces, ranging from 
simple data browser applets to complex applications that allow groups of 
scientists to collaboratively develop data analysis algorithms.</li> 
<li>Developer extensibility in as many ways as possible.</li> </ul> VisAD was 
written by programmers at theSSEC Visualization Project at the University of 
Wisconsin-MadisonSpace Science and Engineering Center, and the Unidata Program 
Center. 
<p></p> 
<h2>WebWinds</h2> 
<p>  WebWinds is a free Java-based science visualization and analysis package. 
In addition to several new analysis tools, the current fourth version does 
automatic scripting. This allows</p> 
<ol> 
<li> a user to rapidly and automatically create and store a session, either 
for his own use, or for use by a collaborator on another machine;</li> 
<li> a data provider to automatically create a specialized analysis 
environment which can be downloaded (as a small script file) along with a 
dataset from a Website; and</li> 
<li> realtime collaboration or sharing of sessions over (even low-bandwidth) 
networks, including the Internet.</li> </ol> 
<p> This scripting requires no knowledge of the scripting language syntax. 
Several sample script files are included with the distribution.</p> 
<p> In addition, this version contains a capability to geo-reference some data 
and to read ASCII data in tabular format. Also new is the ability to output 
data in numerical form (e.g. NetCDF) and a context sensitive, integrated help 
system.</p> 
<p> As with earlier versions, data in several different formats, including 
NetCDF, can be read in easily from your local machine or from the Web. In 
addition, most data can be subset or subsampled on load, making it possible to 
visualize very large multidimensional and/or multispectral datasets. The 
package includes several step-by-step examples. Installation of the software 
(including Java) on the PC or Mac is a process requiring one file to be 
downloaded and opened. If you need help getting started, a remote tutorial is 
available once you've downloaded the package.</p> 
<p> WebWinds is `point and click' rather than language driven and it runs well 
on Unix, Windows (95/98/NT) and Mac platforms. It currently requires JDK 1.1.

<h2>Zebra</h2> Zebra (formerly named Zeb) is a system for data ingest, 
storage, integration and display, designed to operate in both real time and 
postprocessing modes. Zebra was developed by Jonathan Corbet and others in 
NCAR'sResearch Data Program. 
<p>Zebra's primary use is for the superpositioning of observational data sets 
(such as those collected by satellite, radar, mesonet and aircraft) and 
analysis products (such as model results, dual-Doppler synthesis or algorithm 
output). Data may be overlaid on a variety of display types, including constant 
altitude planes, vertical cross-sections, X-Y graphs, Skew-T plots and 
time-height profiles. The fields for display, color tables, contour intervals 
and various other display options are defined using an icon based 
user-interface. This highly flexible system allows scientific investigators to 
interactively superimpose and highlight diverse data sets; thus aiding data 
interpretation.</p> 
<p>Data handling capabilities permit external analysis programs to be easily 
linked with display and data storage processes. The data store accepts incoming 
data, stores it on disk, and makes it available to processes which need it. An 
application library is available for data handling. The library functions allow 
data storage, retrieval and queries using a single applications interface, 
regardless of the data's source and organization. NetCDF data that conforms to 
Zebra conventions is supported by this interface.</p> 
<p>Zebra is currently available to the university research community through 
the NCAR/ATD Research Data Program. Email requests to rdp-support@atd.ucar.edu. 
More information is on the web page http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra.html.</p>

<h2>AVS</h2> AVS (Application Visualization System) is a visualization 
application software and development environment. An AVS module has been 
written that allows multi-dimensional netCDF data sets to read into AVS as 
uniform or rectilinear field files. The AVS user can point and click to specify 
the name of the variable in the selected netCDF file, as well as selecting the 
hyperslab. If 1D coordinate variables exist (a variable that has the same name 
as a dimension) then the coordinate variable will be used to specify the 
coordinates of resulting rectilinear field file. If no coordinate variable 
exists, then the resulting field file will be uniform. Once in AVS, there are 
hundreds of analysis and display modules available for image processing, 
isosurface rendering, arbitrary slicing, alpha blending, streamline and 
vorticity calculation, particle advection, etc. AVS runs on many different 
platforms (Stardent, DEC, Cray, Convex, E and S, SET, Sun, IBM, SGI, HP, FPS 
and WaveTracer), and it has a flexible data model capable of handling 
multidimensional data on non-Cartesian grids.
<p>The module source code and documentation is available from the 
International AVS Center, in the  
ftp://testavs.ncsc.org/avs/AVS5/Module_Src/data_input/read_netcdf/ directory.

<h2>Barrodale UFI</h2> 
<p> Barrodale Computing Services Ltd. (BCS) has developed a product that 
addresses one of the main objections heard from &quot;technologists&quot; 
(e.g., scientists, engineers, and other researchers) who avoid using databases 
to manage their data: &quot;my very large data files are too 
cumbersome/difficult/slow/costly to load into a database&quot;. In addition to 
netCDF, these files come in a variety of formats (HDF5, GRIB, NITFS, FITS, 
etc.).</p> 
<p> This BCS product is called the Universal File Interface (UFI); it's a 
database extension based on the IBM Informix Virtual Table Interface (VTI).<em>
(Please continue reading even if you don't have Informix running on your 
system, because IBM has just made available, at no charge, theInnovator-C 
Edition of Informix.)</em> A demo that uses UFI to access wind speeds can be 
seenhere. </p> 
<p> VTI is a technology that supports making external datasets appear as 
tables to SQL queries and statements. UFI is a BCS database extension for 
delivering the contents of external data files as though they were rows in a 
database table. UFI makes a file look like a set of database tables, so 
&quot;UFI managed tables&quot; are actually virtual database tables. 
Consequently, users of UFI can perform SQL queries on their files without 
having to first load them into a database.</p>

results far superior to distance weighting schemes.</li> </ul> 
<p>Systems currently supported include Win95, WinNT, OS/2, IBM RS/6000, 
Silicon Graphics, HP and SUN workstations.</p> 
<p>SSESCO has implemented a meta-file layer on top of the netCDF library, 
called MeRAF. It handles multiple netCDF files as well as automatic max-min 
calculations, time-varying gridded, particle, and discrete data, logical 
groupings for discrete data, and an overall simplified and flexible interface 
for storing scientific data. MeRAF is being used by the DOE at the 
Hanford-Meteorological Site for observational data and will be used for their 
weather-modeling.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>ESRI</h2> 
<p> ESRI ArcGIS version 9.2 and later support accessing netCDF time-based and 
multidimensional data that follows CF or COARDS conventions for associating 
spatial locations with data. A selected slice of netCDF data may be displayed

netCDF file from Windows Explorer and drop it in an ESRI application such as 
ArcMap.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>HDF Explorer</h2> 
<p> HDF Explorer is a data visualization program that reads the HDF, HDF5 and 
netCDF data file formats (including netCDF classic format data). HDF Explorer 
runs in the Microsoft Windows operating systems.</p> 
<p> HDF Explorer offers a simple yet powerful interface for the visualization 
of HDF and netCDF data. The data is just a click of the mouse away. Data is 
first viewed in a tree-like interface, and then optionally loaded and 
visualized in a variety of ways. HDF Explorer features include fast access to 
data, grid, scalar and vector views. It also allows exporting your data either 
as an ASCII text file or a bitmap image.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>IDL Interface</h2> IDL (Interactive Data Language) is a scientific 
computing environment, developed and supported byExcelis Visual Information 
Solutions, that combines mathematics, advanced data visualization, scientific 
graphics, and a graphical user interface toolkit to analyze and visualize 
scientific data. Designed for use by scientists and scientific application 
developers, IDL's array-oriented, fourth-generation programming language allows 
you to prototype and develop complete applications. IDL now supports data in 
netCDF format.
<p>As an example, here is how to read data from a netCDF variable named GP in 
a file named &quot;data/aprin.nc&quot; into an IDL variable named gp using the 
IDL language:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> id = ncdf_open('data/april.nc') ncdf_varget,id, ncdf_varid( id, 'GP'), gp
</pre> Now you can visualize the data in the gp variable in a large variety of 
ways and use it in other computations in IDL. You can FTP a demo version of 
IDL, including the netCDF interface, by following the instructions in 
pub/idl/README available via anonymous FTP from gateway.rsinc.com or 
boulder.colorado.edu.
<p>Other software packages that use or interoperate with IDL to access netCDF

module set forIRIS Explorer. Two of the modules,  ReadDFG (to output Grids), and
 ReadDF (to output Lattices) are capable of reading from NCSA HDF files, 
MFHDF/3.3 files, and Unidata netCDF files. A user-friendly interface provides 
control and information about the contents of the files.</p> 
<p>For ReadDF, the format translation is handled transparently. Up to five 
unique lattices may be generated from the file (as these files can contain 
multiple data fields) using a single module. A variety of dimensionalities and 
data types are supported also. Multiple variables may be combined in a single 
lattice to generate vector data. All three Explorer coordinate systems are 
supported.</p> 
<p>With ReadDFG, user selected variables from the file are output in up to 
five PATHFINDER grids. Each grid can consist of scalar data from one variable 
or vector data from multiple variables. Coordinate information from the file is 
also included in the grids. Any number of dimensions in any of the Explorer 
coordinate types are supported.</p>

<h2>PPLUS</h2> Plot-Plus (PPLUS) is a general purpose scientific graphics 
package, which is used in several PMEL applications. It will read most standard 
ascii or binary files, as well as netCDF file format, which used by the 
TOGA-TAO Project and the EPIC system for management display and analysis. PPLUS 
is an interactive, command driven, scientific graphics package which includes 
features such as Mercator projection, Polar Stereographic projection, color or 
gray scale area-fill contour plotting, and support for many devices: X-windows, 
PostScript, HP, Tektronix, and others. This powerful and flexible package 
recognizes netCDF data format, and it can extract axis lables and graph titles 
from the data files. The user can customize a plots, or combine several plots 
into a composite. Plots are of publication quality. The PPLUS graphics package 
is used for all the TAO workstation displays, including the animations. The 
animations are created by generating a PPLUS plot for each frame, transforming 
the PPLUS metacode files into HDF format with the PPLUS m2hdf filter, and then 
displaying the resulting bit maps as an animation with the XDataSlice utility, 
which is freely available on Internet from the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications, at anonymous@ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu (141.142.20.50). 
There is also a new m2gif utility which produces GIF files from PPLUS metacode 
files.

<h2>PV-Wave</h2> PV-Wave is a software environment from Visual Numerics for 
solving problems requiring the application of graphics, mathematics, numerics 
and statistics to data and equations.
<p>PV-WAVE uses a fourth generation language (4GL) that analyzes and displays 
data as you enter commands. PV-WAVE includes integrated graphics, numerics, 
data I/O, and data management. The latest version of PV-Wave supports data 
access in numerous formats, including netCDF.</p> 
<p>See also the information on DDI for another way to use netCDF data with 
PV-Wave.</p>

<h2>Slicer Dicer</h2> Slicer Dicer is a volumetric data visualization tool, 
currently available for Windows and under development for other platforms. The 
Slicer Dicer Web site includes a complete list of features, an on-line user's 
guide, and examples of Slicer Dicer output. Visualizations features include:
<ul> 
<li>Perspective view of data rendered on interactively selected orthogonal 
slices, oblique slices, blocks (arbitrary rectilinear sub-volumes), cutouts, 
isosurfaces, and projected volumes (projected maximum, minimum, maximum 
absolute, or minimum absolute).</li> 
<li>Optional annotations: caption, axes ticks and labels (default 
&quot;pretty&quot; ticks, or override to place ticks where you want them), 
color legend, data-cube outline.</li> 
<li>Animation modes: slices, space, time (any parametric dimension), 
transparency, oblique slice orientation, rotation. Built-in animation viewer 
supports speed and image size controls, single-step, forward, backward, loop, 
and back-and-forth modes.</li> 
<li>Select color scale from 25+ built in color tables, or import from palette 
file. Any data level or range of levels can be painted with an arbitrary color.
</li> 
<li>Any data level or range of levels can be rendered as either opaque or 
transparent.</li> </ul>

<h2>vGeo</h2> 
<p> vGeo (Virtual Global Explorer and Observatory) is an end-user product from 
VRCO designed to import and visualize multiple disparate data sets, including 
computer simulations, observed measurements, images, model objects, and more. 
vGeo is available for IRIX, Linux and Windows platforms and supports displays 
ranging from desktop monitors to multi-walled projection systems. It accepts 
data in a variety of formats, including netCDF, and allows the user to specify 
how multiple files and variables are mapped into a data source. 3D graphics are 
built from the underlying data in real-time, and the user has interactive 
control of graphics, navigation, animation, and more.</p>

<h2>VISAGE and Decimate</h2> 
<p> VISAGE (VISualization, Animation, and Graphics Environment) is a turnkey 
3D visualization system developed at General Electric Corporate Research and 
Development, (Schroeder, WJ et al, &quot;VISAGE: An Object-Oriented Scientific 
Visualization System&quot;, Proceedings of Visualization `92 Conference). 
VISAGE is designed to interface with a wide variety of data, and uses netCDF as 
the preferred format.</p> 
<p>VISAGE is used at GE Corporate R &amp; D, GE Aircraft Engine, GE Canada, GE 
Power Generation, as well as ETH Zurich, Switzerland, MQS In Chieti, Italy, and 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.</p> 
<p>GE has another application called &quot;Decimate&quot; that does polygon 
reduction/decimation (Schroeder,WJ et al, &quot;Decimation of Triangle 
Meshes&quot;, Proceedings of SIGGRAPH `92). This application uses netCDF as a 
preferred format. Decimate is currently licensed to Cyberware, Inc., makers of 
3D laser digitizing hardware. Decimate is currently bundled with the scanners, 
and will soon be available as a commercial product.</p> <br>
