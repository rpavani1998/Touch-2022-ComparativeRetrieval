R, SAGA, other minor things <br>
 &laquo;<b> on:</b> October 18, 2008, 09:56:36 PM &raquo; <br>
<br>
 First of 
all, thanks for providing this service.&nbsp; It will be advantageous to my 
career to learn how to do some basic GIS stuff.&nbsp; And doing this in a VM is 
great as it seems like something you could easily specialize your whole OS for.
<br> <br>
A couple of things that (I think) could improve your VM.&nbsp; First 
a minor gripe: the monthly cron jobs (especially scrollkeeper-update) ran on 
the first startup.&nbsp; I am not sure how you might prevent this (release on 
the 2nd of the month) but it made the system very sluggish for about 20-30 
minutes.&nbsp; Not a big deal but this might turn some people away if they 
don't know why this is happening.<br>
<br>
Second, some software that I think 
would be really useful to have on there:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>R for statistical analysis (http://www.r-project.org/)<br>
Here's a nice 
repository for R and several of its core packages:<br>
<b>deb 
http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu hardy/</b><br>
<br>
Adding the 
public key:<br>
<b>gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net --recv E2A11821<br>
gpg 
--export --armor E2A11821 | sudo apt-key add -</b><br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>SAGA (http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html)<br>
(I don't know much about 
this but it is apparently pretty popular for analysis - also has good 
integration with R).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>QGIS plugin for R (http://www.ftools.ca/manageR.html) - pretty easy to 
install.</li> </ul> <br>
In case you couldn't tell, I really like R <br>
<br>

Also, can you recommend any tutorials for getting started with some of this 
software?&nbsp; And what about a standalone version of GRASS for use with 
people who have more advanced skills?&nbsp; I know it is installed with QGIS 
but I am not exactly sure what that entails, or if GRASS can be used on its own 
in its current form. <br>

 Thanks jnylen for your feedback. <br>
I 
will try to prevent that stuff from the first startup. I could release a 
suspended VM. That would speed-up the first run for sure, but... I appreciate 
all suggestions about this...<br>
<br>
And Yes, R is a must!!! I already 
received a GISVM-R version from a user that installed R and several other tools 
over the current GISVM. I am considering it, &#133;<br>
What do you think about 
a GISVM Geostatistical special edition?<br>
There is a problem, R turns GISVM 
bigger and needs several other stuff, including MySQL&#133;<br>
<br>
Yes, 
GRASS, OpenJUMP, etc, are very needed!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>

 I 
was not aware that R required MySQL?&nbsp; There are packages to work with the 
existing PostgreSQL database system, and I have found that any ODBC data source 
is very easy to work with on Windows.&nbsp; I have set PostgreSQL up to work 
with ODBC before on Linux, so the same is probably true there.<br>
<br>
I would 
definitely be most interested in a Geostatistical edition.&nbsp; I found your 
VM through the &quot;R-sig-Geo -- R Special Interest Group on using 
Geographical data and Mapping&quot; mailing list:
https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo . <br>
<br>
As far as the cron 
jobs go, I am not sure that releasing a suspended VM would help - the monthly 
cron jobs are executed when you release the product one month and a user runs 
it for the first time the next month.&nbsp; As soon as the system would 
&quot;wake up&quot; and realize that a month has gone by without running those 
jobs, it should start them.<br>
<br>
It may be safe to disable 
scrollkeeper-update entirely (delete the symlink from /etc/cron.monthly) but I 
am not sure.&nbsp; It does seem like that job is the main culprit of the 
slowdown.&nbsp; This program could still be run manually prior to each 
release.&nbsp; Or if it turns out to be a bad idea to remove it, /etc/crontab 
would be easily modified to run it every 3 months or something similar. <br>

 Hi to all 
<br> <br>
The GISVM-R is just the standard GIVSM with R, basically it has 95% 
of the packages necessary to run all the geospatial/geostatistical analysis 
from the book &quot;Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R&quot;. This means 
that&nbsp; is capable of raster, vector, table data analysis, interpolation, 
linear regressions,modelling etc&nbsp; etc<br>
<br>
The GISVM-R has python 
installed (and the ERIC IDE) with Rpy 1.0.1, so python can access the R 
libraries and run calculations.<br>
<br>
The QGIS doesnt have the R connection 
plugin, I will update the VM with this plugin in the following days.<br>
<br>
R 
doesnt need MySQL to run !!!!! I just installed MySQL because it is my 
favourite database and it is commonly used for &quot;light&quot; projects, so R 
has the RMySQL package but also the RODBC&nbsp; for any DB access.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the bad news !!!!! RSAGA doesnt work in Linux !!!!!&nbsp; Probably the 
only way to access R should be thru the Python prompt of SAGA and then using 
Rpy. RSAGA will be installed in the next release<br>
<br>
I will keep the forum 
updated<br>

 Hi, just a short reply on the question on the use of GRASS; 
that should be possible (at least when using Linux as guest), just open a 
terminal and type 'grass' (without the quotes obviously).<br>
<br>
I would like 
to second the idea of an GISVM Geostatistical special edition. Is there 
anywhere I can download the GISVM-R edition?<br>

Exactly! 
GRASS is installed and can be used inside QGIS or outside with grass command 
line. Thanks for remind this!<br>
