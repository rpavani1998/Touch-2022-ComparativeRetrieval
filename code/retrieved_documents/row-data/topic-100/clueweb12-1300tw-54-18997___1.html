<h1>Marketing optimization with LityxIQ</h1>  April 3, 2012 By David Smith <br>
<p></p>  (This article was first published on <strong> Revolutions</strong>, 
and kindly contributed toR-bloggers) <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Marketing is one of the pioneering domains when it comes to applications of 
predictive analytics to Big Data. (For example, how Target used statistical 
modeling to predict demographic attribues of customers, like pregnancy, 
to&Acirc;&nbsp;target coupons.) To get such powerful insights into the hands of 
marketers, DC-area company LityxIQ provides a cloud-based solution:LityxIQ, 
&quot;an integrated hosted analytics platform for marketing insights, 
predictive models, and marketing optimization&quot;.</p> 
<p>LityxIQ allows marketers to automate the loading and managing multiple data 
sources, automatically build and manage predictive models, and optimize 
marketing budget and media decisions. TheR language is used to implement those 
models behind the scenes, making use of its&Acirc;&nbsp;predictive algorithms 
and for its powerful variable selection capabilities. I asked Lityx CEO Paul 
Maiste why he chose R to implement these models instead of other statistical 
software packages.&Acirc;&nbsp;&quot;We used R in developing the platform in 
order to take advantage of the flexibility of the language and wealth of 
supported algorithm&quot;, he said. &quot;In addition, it allows us to fully 
integrate model building and scoring easily using its object-oriented 
architecture.&quot; Some of the R functions and packages used 
include&Acirc;&nbsp;glm&Acirc;&nbsp;(for generalized linear modeling), MASS, 
rpart (decision trees), nnet (neural netwoks), and rjson (for data exchange).

<p>If you're interested in learning more about LityxIQ, there will be a free 
webinar this Thursday, presented by Lityx. I've included the webinar abstract 
and the registration link below.</p>
