<p><em> This is an interview with Jeffrey D. Long, Professor in the Department 
of Psychiatry, Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa (USA) and 
author of the book &ldquo;Longitudinal Data Analysis for the Behavioral 
Sciences Using R&ldquo;. Dr. Long answers questions about his book and how he 
uses R in his work in behavioral sciences.</em></p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Hello Jeffrey. Please, give us a brief introduction 
about yourself.</p> 
<p>I am a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Carver College of 
Medicine, University of Iowa (USA). My expertise is applied statistics in the 
behavioral and medical sciences. I am the head statistician for Neurobiological 
Predictors of Huntington&rsquo;s Disease (PREDICT-HD), funded by the National 
Institutes of Health and the CHDI Foundation, Inc. PREDICT-HD is a longitudinal 
observational study of individuals at-risk for Huntington&rsquo;s Disease (HD), 
which is an inherited neurodegenerative disease. PREDICT-HD has several 
scientific sections that concentrate on different aspects of HD, including 
brain imaging, cognitive functioning, motor impairment, and psychiatric 
problems. My biostatistics team analyzes data from the scientific sections to 
answer substantive research questions.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>How did you get involved with open source software?
</p> 
<p>I became involved with open source software through two routes: teaching 
and my daily professional activities. I taught applied statistics courses for 
many years to students with diverse backgrounds working in various setting. 
Commercial software was a concern because of its cost and availability, and I 
turned to the open source R system for statistical computing and graphics (
http://www.r-project.org/). My professional activities involve statistical 
analysis and writing reports. I needed an integrated process that will handle 
both aspects. This is provided through R, and the other open source packages, 
Emacs (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS; 
http://ess.r-project.org/), and Sweave (
http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/). </p> 
<p>The integrated components allow a program file to have both R and LaTex 
syntax interweaved. The statistical analysis is performed in a pre-compilation 
step, and the results are embedded in the Tex file, which is compiled to 
produce the final PDF report. The method is highly desirable in my work, as 
databases are updated continually requiring the updating of reports. To the 
best of my knowledge, this cannot be performed in commercial software packages, 
as there is little or no cooperation.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Tell us the story behind your book &ldquo;
Longitudinal Data Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences Using R&ldquo;.</p> 
<p>The book is a culmination of teaching an applied longitudinal data analysis 
course for many years. There are relatively few people who use R in the 
behavioral sciences and I wanted to emphasize that it is a good option for 
researchers and students. R is free software that offers add-on packages 
authored by world leading authorities in longitudinal data analysis and 
graphing.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Who will benefit from reading it?</p> 
<p>The beneficiaries are researchers and students who want a practical 
introduction to the analysis of longitudinal behavioral data. Longitudinal data 
is defined as repeated measurements taken on the same subjects over time. Such 
data is correlated within an individual and this should be considered in 
statistical modeling. The book focuses on the application of linear mixed 
effects regression (LMER). The book is specifically written for those who want 
a hands-on approach to using R for LMER modeling. The software and the data 
sets can be freely downloaded and all the examples can be reproduced on the 
reader&rsquo;s own computer.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>How will you describe your experience writing the 
book?</p> 
<p>The joy of the book was digging deeper into the open source software. The 
entire book was written using the integrated components that I previously 
mentioned. I learned many tips and tricks along the way that have increased 
efficiency in my daily professional work.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Have you published other FLOSS related books?</p> 
<p>Yes. Two former students (A. Zieffler and J. Harring) and I have published 
another book focusing on the application of R for the statistical comparison of 
groups:&ldquo;Comparing Groups: Randomization and Bootstrap Methods Using 
R&rdquo;.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Do you have plans for other books?</p> 
<p>Not in the near-future.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Why is free/libre open source scientific software 
important for your field?</p> 
<p>For students, open source is important because it makes world-class 
statistical software available regardless of one&rsquo;s personal or 
institutional resources (except for an Internet connection). For professionals 
in my field, open source means that software can be made available 
simultaneously with new methods that are introduced in professional 
publications. The result is that new and useful tools can be used immediately 
for researchers who need them.</p> 
<p><strong>F4S: </strong>Which projects, books, blogs or sites related to open 
source software for science can you recommend?</p> 
<p>There are many websites I regularly consult for help with R, LaTex, Emacs, 
and ESS. I will list the website by topic.</p>
