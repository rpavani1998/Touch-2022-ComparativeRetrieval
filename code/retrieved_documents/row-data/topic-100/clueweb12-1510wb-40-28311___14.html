<h1>UPDATED: Must-Have Python Packages for Social Scientists</h1>  By Drew 
Conway, on June 18th, 2008 
<p>Python is the greatest thing to happen to computer science since the Turing 
Machine! Well, no, but it has inspired me into a personal renaissance for 
software writing. Its flexibility, widespread community support, and leveraging 
of legacy C and Fortran code also make it an outstanding language for social 
science researchers.<br>
 If you are a new researcher looking to get started, 
or experienced and willing to walk away from your [:,:] lifestyle in 
Matlab&mdash;and licensing and training fees&mdash;then equip yourself with 
these 10 packages and get to it!</p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<h3> 
<li>NumPy</li> </h3> 
<p>NumPy, short for Numeric Python, is the cornerstone of Python&rsquo;s 
mathematics and statistics operations. All scientific computing in Python 
starts and ends with NumPy!<br>
Download NumPy</p> 
<h3> 
<li>SciPy</li> </h3> 
<p>SciPy, short for Scientific Python, is the little brother of NumPy, as it 
relies on NumPy data types for its operations. To distinguish itself, SciPy 
adds several of its own sophisticated data types, and integration and 
optimization techniques. Many of the packages proceeding this rely on some 
combination of NumPy and SciPy.<br>
Download SciPy</p> 
<h3> 
<li>Matplotlib</li> </h3> 
<p>The third tine on Python&rsquo;s scientific trident, Matplotlib (pylab) is 
the standard for 2D plotting. Highly extensible, and will display your results 
just the way you like &lsquo;em.<br>
Download Matplotlib</p> 
<h3> 
<li>NetworkX</li> </h3> 
<p>This package is what motivated me to learn Python. This is the best tool 
for analyzing network data&ndash;period. For novice social network 
analysts/graph theorist, the learning curve will be steep, but taking the time 
to learn NX will preclude you from having to waste your time withother inferior 
tools. Oh, and for those of you with accreditation concerns, its subversion is 
maintained by Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br>
Download NetworkX</p> 
<h3> 
<li>PyMC</li> </h3> 
<p>This one is for all of you Bayesian/MCMC modelers out there. PyMC 
implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a Python class, providing 
flexibility when building your model. PyMC is also highly extensible, and well 
supported by the community.<br>
Download PyMC</p> 
<h3> 
<li>SimPy</li> </h3> 
<p> Short for &ldquo;Simulation in Python&rdquo;, SimPy is an object-oriented, 
process-based discrete-event simulation language, making it a wholesale 
agent-based modeling environment written entirely in Python. While not as 
robust asREPAST or NetLogo, SimPy provides an excellent tool set for designing 
experiments, and because it is pure Python, the data can be fed to other 
analytical packages.<br>
Download SimPy</p> 
<h3> 
<li>SymPy</li> </h3> 
<p>Not to be confused with the previous entry, SymPy is an full-featured 
Python library for symbolic mathematics.Oliver suggested I add Sage to the 
list, which is an excellent tool, but SymPy contains nearly all of the same 
functionality (algebraic evaluation, differentiation, expansion, complex 
numbers, etc.), but is contained in a pure Python distribution. This package is 
great for researchers who want symbolic mathematics support, but have no access 
to mega-expensive computer algebra systems, likeMathematica.<br>
Download SymPy
<br> <strong>UPDATE</strong>: How to use Python and SymPy to solve optimization 
problems.</p> 
<h3> 
<li>html5lib</li> </h3> 
<p>After the fall of BeautifulSoup, I was desperate for a web data parser that 
equaled soup&rsquo;s flexibility and easy of use. Enter html5lib. If you need 
to download and organize large amounts of data from the Internet in a quick and 
easy way, then html5lib is the only package you will need. This module also 
supports the BeautifulSoup tree type, as well as many others, making it 
incredibly useful across a wide range of tasks. To take advantage of its power, 
you will need a little background in HTML (or XML, if that happens to be what 
you are parsing), but there aremany tutorials available online to get you up to 
speed quickly.<br>
Download html5lib</p> 
<h3> 
<li>Pycluster</li> </h3> 
<p>There are many clustering algorithms available for Python, but many of 
these packages are designed to cluster one-dimensional data. Data collected by 
social scientist, however, is often of a higher dimension&ndash;enter 
Pycluster. This package contains efficient implementations of hierarchical and 
k-means clustering, with several options for measuring distance. Still waiting 
for a clever binding to Matplotlib to draw the dendrogram, but in the meantime, 
you can use their Java programTreeView to display result.<br>
Download Pycluster
</p> 
<h3> 
<li>cjson</li> </h3> 
<p>This module implements a very fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python. JSON (
JavaScript Object Notation) is useful for many things, but most notably for 
social scientist is how many social networking sites use JSON to encode public 
data about their users and their users&rsquo; relationships. JSON is also what 
is returned by Google&rsquo;sSocialGraph API, so cjson allows researchers to 
feed this social network data directly into Python data types.<br>
Download 
cjson</p> 
<h3> 
<li>Pyevolve</li> </h3> 
<p> A complete pure python genetic algorithm framework. I am wearing my 
computer science background on my sleeve with this one, but for people serious 
about designing pure Pythonagent-based models, Pyevolve provides the tools to 
create intricate experimental environments.<br>
Download Pyevolve</p> 
<h3> 
<li>MySQL for Python</li> </h3> 
<p> A pure Python binding for MySQL, allowing the user to integrate MySQL 
execution into any Python script. Very straightforward and simple to use, and 
since many social science data sets are stored on MySQL databases, a necessity.
<br> Download MySQL for Python<br>
<strong>Updated 4/6/2009&gt;: </strong> I 
have been negligent, as itpointed out in the comments, RPy has functionally 
been replaced by RPy2.</p> 
<h3> 
<li>RPy2</li> </h3> 
<p> There are very few statistical calculations that the combination of NumPy 
and SciPy cannot handle, but there are NO statistical operations R cannot do. 
RPy2 is a simple Python interface for R, able to execute any R function from 
within a Python script.<br>
Download RPy2</p> </ol> 
<p>I should also note that most (maybe all by now) of these packages come 
standard with theEnthought distribution of Python. If you are interested in 
using Python as a platform for scientific research, I highly recommend 
installing this distribution,which is free for academics.</p> <br>

<p>Thanks for the pyEvolve link &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been looking for something 
like this for quite awhile. Agent based simulations are very interesting 
indeed. Thanks </p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/ Drew Conway <br>

<p>I am glad the list was helpful. I with there was a PyGeneticProgramming 
counterpart to PyEvolve so models could be built that blended GP&rsquo;s 
sophisticated agent evolution; but alas, no one has done the heavy lifting for 
me yet.<br>
 If there is enough interest, I will post another update in the 
near future with a few additional packages I have run across since the last 
update.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li> Vamsee <br>

<p>Thanks for the packages, I used to think numPy is only for high level 
scientific calculations. And also thanks for networkX, I initially worked on 
graphviz but this baby fits right into my programming environment.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/ Drew Conway <br>

<p>Although visualizations are one of NetworkX&rsquo;s weaknesses, it does 
have a very nice graphviz binding if you want to display your analysis.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://libreamoi.com Olivier Lauzanne <br>

<p>I would also add sage which integrates most of those tools.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/ Drew Conway <br>

<p>Oliver, I totally agree. In my next update I am going to add a great Python 
package for symbolic mathematics that incorporates much of the functionality of 
Sage.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://brunomlopes.blogspot.com Bruno <br>

<p>I&rsquo;d add ipython: http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/<br>
 It&rsquo;s an 
amazing replacement for the vanilla shell, with auto-completion, pdb 
integration to drop you on the stack of a previous exception, pretty printing, 
session history, and many more.<br>
 Really, can&rsquo;t work without it </p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/ Drew Conway <br>

<p>Thanks for the addition Bruno. I agree, iPython is a good tool, but in 
terms of IDE I have a hard time getting away from IDLE. I have tried others, 
and people harp on how many better options there are, but I can&rsquo;t seem to 
shake it.<br>
 If I had to switch though, and since I am a MacPython user, it 
would be toTextMate.</p>

<p>Hello Conway, I&rsquo;m author of PyEvolve, thank you for indicating the 
framework. Good luck on your social studies; any help you needs, just mail.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://blogs.nyu.edu/blogs/agc282/zia/ Drew Conway <br>

<p>Perone, thanks, and I just updated my PyEvolve to the new 
version&ndash;looks great!</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li>

<p>One small update to your list. Rpy has practically been replaced by Rpy2, 
which uses slightly different syntax but feels more robust. It is the actively 
developed strain of Rpy. You can find the links to Rpy2 from the Rpy page.</p>

<li> RR <br>

<p>Very helpful list, thanks for posting!</p> 
<p>A question: I like both R and Python a lot but would love to 
&ldquo;standardize&rdquo; on one for my modeling/number-crunching needs. The 
hassle of remembering two sets of details is getting to me. Any words of wisdom 
on making this choice? Thanks.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.drewconway.com/ Drew Conway <br>

<p>RR,</p> 
<p>I am very biased here, since Python pretty much brought me back from the 
brink of giving up software coding. That said, Python is an extremely versatile 
and easy to learn language, so I would recommend focusing and building you 
skills there.</p> 
<p>If you are find that there is something you can&rsquo;t do in Python, and 
there is an easy solution in R, just run it through RPy.</p> 
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li> RR <br>

<p>Thanks for the quick response, Drew.</p>

<p>Dear Drew,</p> 
<p>Thanks for this compilation of Python tools. Fantastic! I have a question: 
do you have any experience building/executing agent-based models in Python? 
I&rsquo;ve been always afraid that the easiness of programming in Python will 
not be compensate the execution speed (as usual with interpreters). Regards.</p>
<p>[Reply]</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.cumberlandgenetic.com Mark <br>

<p>Thanks for this. Been relying heavily on python and R for years in and out 
of school in the field of quantatative/molecular genetics of livestock. 
Recently python has become more and more of a core component of my workflow 
with RPy for the plotting/graphing and modeling components.</p>

<p>Great article. I&rsquo;ve recently embarked upon a bit of complex networks 
research with a former colleague of mine and I am currently surveying the tools 
available so this article is particularly timely for me. I was looking into 
using the Network Workbench and Gephi for most of my analysis, but I would love 
to have something like NetworkX that I could use from Python just for the 
ability to automate much of the drudgery. If you&rsquo;ve got the time to 
reply, I&rsquo;d love to read some of your thoughts on why you think NetworkX 
is superior to some of the tools you listed above with a specific emphasis on 
the Network Workbench since that is one of the tools that I am considering as 
well.</p>

<p>I do plenty of genomic data mining with python. I need the statistical 
functions of R but unfortunately R is a PAIN to learn and work with. I still 
dont understand its data structures, also its script is archaic. I will 
definitely look into rpy2.</p> 
<p>I should mention that it is important to contribute as well to python 
libraries. My personal goal would be to bring pythons statistical capabilities 
to that of spss or systat.</p>
