<p><strong>pandas</strong> is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and 
expressive data structures designed to make working with 
&ldquo;relational&rdquo; or &ldquo;labeled&rdquo; data both easy and intuitive. 
It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical,
<strong>real world</strong> data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the 
broader goal of becoming<strong>the most powerful and flexible open source data 
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language</strong>. It is already 
well on its way toward this goal.</p> 
<p>pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or 
Excel spreadsheet</li> 
<li>Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
</li> 
<li>Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and 
column labels</li> 
<li>Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually 
need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure</li> </ul> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and 
DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in 
finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users,
DataFrame provides everything that R&rsquo;s data.frame provides and much more. 
pandas is built on top ofNumPy and is intended to integrate well within a 
scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.</p> 
<p>Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Easy handling of <strong>missing data</strong> (represented as NaN) in 
floating point as well as non-floating point data</li> 
<li>Size mutability: columns can be <strong>inserted and deleted</strong> from 
DataFrame and higher dimensional objects</li> 
<li>Automatic and explicit <strong>data alignment</strong>: objects can be 
explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels 
and letSeries, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in 
computations</li> 
<li>Powerful, flexible <strong>group by</strong> functionality to perform 
split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and 
transforming data</li> 
<li>Make it <strong>easy to convert</strong> ragged, differently-indexed data 
in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects</li> 
<li>Intelligent label-based <strong>slicing</strong>, <strong>fancy indexing
</strong>, and <strong>subsetting</strong> of large data sets</li> 
<li>Intuitive <strong>merging</strong> and <strong>joining</strong> data sets
</li> 
<li>Flexible <strong>reshaping</strong> and pivoting of data sets</li> 
<li><strong>Hierarchical</strong> labeling of axes (possible to have multiple 
labels per tick)</li> 
<li>Robust IO tools for loading data from <strong>flat files</strong> (CSV and 
delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast
<strong>HDF5 format</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Time series</strong>-specific functionality: date range generation 
and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear 
regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.</li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently 
experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data 
scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages: 
munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results 
of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is 
the ideal tool for all of these tasks.</p> 
<p>Some other notes</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>pandas is <strong>fast</strong>. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits 
have been extensively tweaked inCython code. However, as with anything else 
generalization usually sacrifices performance. So if you focus on one feature 
for your application you may be able to create a faster specialized tool.</li> 
<li>pandas will soon become a dependency of statsmodels, making it an 
important part of the statistical computing ecosystem in Python.</li> 
<li>pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications.
</li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>Note</p> 
<p>This documentation assumes general familiarity with NumPy. If you 
haven&rsquo;t used NumPy much or at all, do invest some time inlearning about 
NumPy first.</p>
