<h1>Description</h1> 
<p>Random forests are one of the best performing methods for constructing 
ensembles. They derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples 
of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning 
base-level classifiers (decision trees). The base-level algorithm randomly 
selects a subset of the features at each step of tree construction and chooses 
the best among these. We propose to use a combination of concepts used in 
bagging and random subspaces to achieve a similar effect. The latter randomly 
select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of 
the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized 
version of the algorithm). The results of our experiments show that the 
proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests, with 
the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm without the 
need to randomize the latter.</p>
