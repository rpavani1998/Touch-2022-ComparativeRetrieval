The Challenge of Common-Pool Resources <br>
<br>

<p>by Elinor Ostrom<br>
</p> 
<p>In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) 
released its seminal report,<em>Our Common Future,</em> which created a serious 
discussion about how we should engage in sustainable development of the 
world&rsquo;s future, including how to address global resource systems, or 
&ldquo;commons.&rdquo;1 In the two decades that followed, humans have failed to 
halt the tragedy of massive overfishing of the oceans, major deforestation, and 
excessive dumping of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, in some 
specific niches, such as the Maine lobster fishery, the commons are in better 
condition today than they were a decade or two ago.<br>
<br>
Part of the reason 
for the mixed results is that most common-pool resources differ vastly from one 
another. Many government officials and policy analysts&rsquo; advocacy of a 
single idealized solution for all of these resources has been a key part of the 
problem instead of the solution.2 Further, many of the most pressing problems 
future generations will face are on a global scale. Establishing effective 
governance arrangements on this scale has proved to be more difficult than on a 
local scale.<br>
<br>
As the WCED noted in its report, &ldquo;the traditional 
forms of national sovereignty are increasingly challenged by the realities of 
ecological and economic dependence. Nowhere is this more true than in shared 
ecosystems in &lsquo;the global commons.&rsquo;&rdquo;3 Yet the WCED, headed by 
then&ndash;Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, challenged scholars, 
public officials, and citizens to recognize that we all share a common future. 
That future is severely threatened, however, if we do not focus on how to 
protect our common heritage while endeavoring to achieve greater economic 
returns for the peoples of the world. The WCED conceived 
&ldquo;environment&rdquo; as where people live, and &ldquo;development&rdquo; 
as how people try to improve their lives. In<em>Our Common Future,</em> the 
commission wrote, &ldquo;Humanity has the ability to make development 
sustainable&mdash;to ensure it meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&rdquo;4
<br><br>
William Clark of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government evaluated 
the impact of the Brundtland Commission&rsquo;s work for<em>Environment</em> a 
decade after its release.5 Clark reflected that many disappointments, 
resignations, and increased cynicism were expressed at the international 
meetings held to evaluate progress toward sustainable development. In addition 
to the major disappointments of the decade, Clark found some more optimistic 
developments. To see these, he argued,<br>
<em><br>
requires a shift in 
perspective from the current short-term, global view of international 
environmental diplomacy to longer term and more local views of sustainable 
development. These views cannot be found in any one spot. . . . The pictures 
they provide are, of course, mixed, with their own share of environmental 
horrors, economic greed, and program failures. But compared with 20, 10, or 
even 5 years ago, the extent to which notions of sustainability have entered 
mainstream development thinking is astounding.</em><em>6</em><br>
<br>
A few 
years later, from 2001&ndash;2005, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) 
conducted a massive review of the state of the world&rsquo;s ecosystems and 
their services.7 Their first major finding was that the change to ecosystems 
during the past half-century has been more rapid than any comparable period in 
human history. Their second major finding was that while these changes have led 
to substantial net gains in economic development and human well-being, the gains
<br><br>
<em>have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation 
of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the 
exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people. These problems, unless 
addressed, will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations 
obtain from ecosystems.</em><em>8</em><br>
<br>
Thus, the most recent worldwide 
review of our common future warned that major changes threatened our future. 
The MEA also advised that policymakers search for solutions for specific niches 
rather than generalized problems and avoid standardized solutions.<br>
<br>

Looking ahead toward long-term effective management of resource systems on a 
global scale, several important questions require examination: What are 
&ldquo;the commons?&rdquo; How successful have efforts been to sustain the 
world&rsquo;s oceans and forests since the publication of the Brundtland 
report? What role do international regimes play in a sustainable future? What 
lessons have scholars learned about adaptive governance of common-pool 
resources over the past 20 years that can be applied to the next 20 years and 
beyond?<br>
<br>
The Commons and Common-Pool Resources<br>
<br>
Scholars are 
still in the process of developing a shared language for the broad set of 
things called &ldquo;the commons.&rdquo; Commons refer to systems, such as 
knowledge and the digital world, in which it is difficult to limit access, but 
one person&rsquo;s use does not subtract a finite quantity from another&rsquo;s 
use.9 In contrast, common-pool resources are sufficiently large that it is 
difficult, but not impossible, to define recognized users and exclude other 
users altogether. Further, each person&rsquo;s use of such resources subtracts 
benefits that others might enjoy.10 Fisheries and forests are two common-pool 
resources that are of great concern in this era of major ecological challenges. 
Others include irrigation systems, groundwater basins, pastures and grazing 
systems, lakes, oceans, and the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.11 Chapter 10 of the 
Brundtland report primarily discusses the problematic condition of common-pool 
resources in the late 1980s; thus this update will focus on common-pool 
resources.<br>
<br>
Common-pool resources may be governed and managed by a wide 
variety of institutional arrangements that can be roughly grouped as 
governmental, private, or community ownership. Since the WCED report, a 
considerable number of common-pool resources are comanaged by communities 
working with governments.12 Depending on the setting, government ownership, 
private property, community property, and comanagement may succeed or fail in 
sustaining resources and providing good economic returns.13 Open-access 
resources&mdash;common-pool resources that anyone can enter and/or 
harvest&mdash;are likely to be overharvested and potentially destroyed. In his 
classic article, &ldquo;The Tragedy of the Commons,&rdquo; leading ecologist 
Garrett Hardin confused open-access commons with commons that are the joint 
property of a community.14 While Hardin correctly pointed out that valuable 
open-access common-pool resources would be overharvested, his conclusion of an 
inevitable tragedy was too sweeping.<br>
<br>
Continued Overharvesting of Ocean 
Fisheries<br>
<br>
Chapter 10 of the Brundtland report presents a grim picture 
of ocean fisheries&rsquo; management. In 1979, according to data cited in this 
chapter, the total volume of fish captured (from wild fisheries and 
aquaculture&mdash;cultivating fish, especially for food) was more than 70 
million tons, and overexploitation threatened many fishery stocks. &ldquo;With 
conventional management practices, the growth era of fisheries is over,&rdquo; 
the report predicted.15<br>
<br>
The situation has not improved in the 20 years 
since the report was issued, although at first glance, the data might seem to 
indicate the WCED&rsquo;s prediction was<em>in</em>correct. Table 1 below 
presents world fish catch data in major regional fisheries from 1979 through 
2005.16 The total volume of fish caught in major fisheries around the world has 
doubled in size from 70 million tons in 1979 to 141 million tons in 2005. A 
closer look reveals that this prediction is true for developed countries, where 
the volume of catch has steadily declined since 1979. As of 2005, just 20 
percent of the total catch is now harvested in developed-country fisheries. On 
the other hand, harvesting from fisheries of developing countries, but not 
necessarily by local fishers, has continued to grow and is now 80 percent of 
the vastly increased overall total. The proportion of the world&rsquo;s total 
catch that is derived from aquaculture&mdash;again largely in the developing 
world&mdash;has also steadily risen.17<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>While the harvesting volume has doubled, the population of many species 
harvested for food has declined or disappeared.18 A basic problem leading to 
massive overfishing in the oceans is the lack of<em>any</em> property rights 
for the many commercially valuable species in the open ocean. Most of the ocean 
fisheries are truly open access. Fishery after fishery has been subject to 
massive overfishing, including the tuna and whale fisheries in the Pacific, the 
cod fishery in the Atlantic, and the lobster and conch fisheries in the 
Caribbean.19<br>
<br>
In 1982, the United Nations Conference on the Law of the 
Sea did remove around one-third of the oceans from the international realm by 
establishing Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) that extend 200 nautical miles 
along the oceanic borders of coastal states. EEZs assign sovereign powers to 
coastal states to manage these resources and assure they are not endangered by 
overexploitation.20 That agreement was heralded by the WCED, which stated 
&ldquo;not only do governments now have the legal power and the self-interest 
to apply sound principles of resource management within this area, but they 
have an obligation to do so.&rdquo;21 Instead, many governments subsidized an 
expansion of their own national fleets, leading to increased rather than 
decreased fishing in coastal regions. National governments also tended to use 
relatively crude models of fishery dynamics in the early years of their 
responsibilities and had insufficient data to assess stocks.22<br>
<br>
In 
Canada, for example, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) used a model 
of stock regeneration for northern cod that scientists later determined was 
flawed.23 Further, highly aggregated and incomplete data was used in deciding 
on quotas. Even though local fishers in Newfoundland feared a collapse was 
near, the Canadian DFO assured everyone that the cod fishery was recuperating 
from earlier excessive harvests. In 1992, however, they reversed earlier 
policies and declared a moratorium on all fishing for northern cod in Canadian 
waters.24 The real tragedy here is that the local fishers, who had established 
local rules for managing the fishery before the government&rsquo;s intervention 
and were the backbone of local economies, paid the cost of the collapse rather 
than the officials who had not listened to them. The cod fishery has not yet 
recovered: the cod fishers have had to leave local villages, find jobs 
elsewhere, or go on welfare.<br>
<br>
Setting scientifically recommended 
fishing quotas for large coastal fisheries&mdash;even when official authority 
exists&mdash;frequently has been difficult and conflict-laden for public 
officials. The 2007 Fishing Quota established by the European Union for eastern 
Baltic cod, for example, ignored the warning of the International Council for 
the Exploitation of the Sea (ICES), the scientific body advising the European 
Union on catch sizes, which strongly advised skipping at least one year in 
authorizing any catch.25 Even the reduced catch levels set for western Baltic 
cod remained 30 percent over the level recommended by ICES. Thus, the authority 
to act and the willingness to make decisions that involve short-term costs for 
the fishing industry (even when it is in their long-term interest) are not 
equivalent.<br>
<br>
A team led by Fikret Berkes of the University of 
Manitoba&rsquo;s Natural Resources Institute documents another harvesting 
process practiced by &ldquo;roving bandits&rdquo; that is sequentially 
devastating coastal fisheries even within EEZs: &ldquo;Roving banditry is 
different from most commons dilemmas in that a new dynamic has arisen in the 
globalized world: New markets can develop so rapidly that the speed of resource 
exploitation often overwhelms the ability of local institutions to 
respond.&rdquo;26 Due to developments in the technology of fishing, large, 
high-powered boats can zoom into a local fishery, massively harvest it for a 
valuable species in the international market, and then move to another location 
before local authorities respond. These roving bandits have depleted the sea 
urchin fisheries in Japan, Korea, Mexico, Chile, Russia, Alaska, the eastern 
coast of Canada, and the northwestern and northeastern coasts of the United 
States.<br>
<br>
While the news related to ocean fisheries and many coastal 
fisheries is bleak, it is not entirely grim for fishery stocks on all coasts. 
In the state of Maine, for example, local fishers and state officials have 
successfully evolved ways to manage lobster stocks. The fishery underwent a 
major shock around 1930 when the stocks fell sharply for unknown reasons. Since 
that time, stocks have risen substantially and are now higher than they were in 
the nineteenth century. This resurgence is due to favorable environmental 
conditions combined with the evolution of effective rules of diverse origins. 
State legislature passed formal conservation laws as a first set of rules in 
response to substantial lobbying from fishers and their associations. These 
rules give effective protection to juvenile lobsters and proven breeding stock 
as well as limit the number of lobster traps. A second set of territorial rules 
developed by fishers allocate fishing locations to fishers living near and 
fishing from a particular harbor. These rules enable lobster fishers to monitor 
each other&rsquo;s harvesting with substantial effectiveness.27<br>
<br>
The 
evolved Maine lobster system strikes a relatively delicate balance. James 
Wilson of the University of Maine and colleagues have developed a detailed set 
of simulations showing that if fishers had not taken substantial responsibility 
for monitoring each other&rsquo;s harvesting behavior, the successful fishery 
would have been overharvested&mdash;and potentially may have collapsed like 
many others around the world.28 In contrast, while international groups, 
state-level public officials, and the fishers tried to regulate the lobster 
fisheries in the Caribbean, none of these groups&rsquo; efforts have been able 
to stem the overharvesting of lobster in this region.29<br>
<br>
In the 
November 2007 issue of<em>Environment,</em> Raul P. Lejano and Helen Ingram of 
the University of California, Irvine, document a very successful local system 
that evolved over a decade in the Turtle Islands of the Philippines.30 While 
outsiders were deeply involved in the effort to find mechanisms that would 
control overfishing of turtle eggs, they worked very closely with local fishers 
and officials to develop a system, the Pawikan Conservation Project, which was 
well-matched to the local economy. As can be seen in Figure 2 of their article,
31 the percentage of eggs conserved steadily rose from the commencement of the 
Pawikan program in the mid-1980s through the 1990s without any major conflict 
among participants.<br>
<br>
Tragically, national officials did not recognize 
local rules when they passed the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection 
Act in 2001, which prohibted hunting of threatened wildlife and banned the 
collection of marine turtle eggs. The law was largely based on international 
conventions that stress the importance of protecting endangered species. Very 
soon after the law was passed, &ldquo;turtle egg conservation in the Turtle 
Island system ceased altogether, and depletion of turtle eggs proceeded at an 
alarming rate. One preliminary assessment estimates that egg conservation rates 
dropped from about 80 percent to 40 percent in about one year.&rdquo;32 The 
imposition of an external, but unenforceable, rule destroyed the preexisting 
local rules. Lejano and Ingram&rsquo;s article provides a counterargument to 
the notion that only government ownership or management solves the problem of 
the commons, detailing how top-down rulemaking without an awareness of local 
norms, rules, and evolved institutions can lead to disaster.<br>
<br>
With the 
establishment of EEZs, some coastal fisheries in Canada, New Zealand, and 
Iceland have been able to develop individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems 
that have reduced the level of harvesting in key coastal fisheries. Governments 
assign ITQs, official harvesting quotas, to a fisher that then may use them to 
harvest his or her assigned quantity or sell them to another fisher (hence the 
term &ldquo;transferable&rdquo;). In British Columbia, early governmental 
policies trying to control overfishing of the trawl fishery for groundfish 
included restricting the number of fishing vehicles and the equipment that 
could be used, as well as assigning total allowable catch (TAC) and fishing 
trip quotas. In 1995, the fishery was closed, however, due to a major collapse. 
The DFO reopened the fishery several years later with new regulations, 
including an annual ITQ system.33 Further, they established a rigorous 
monitoring program in which onboard observers record all catches. The ITQ 
system has collected more valid data, decreased fleet overcapacity, recorded 
catch levels close to allocated quotas, and reduced discard of unwanted 
species. By comparison, ITQ systems that lack an effective monitoring system 
have suffered from considerable underreporting of catch levels.<br>
<br>
New 
Zealand declared its 200-mile EEZ in 1983. In 1986, New Zealand became one of 
the first countries to adopt a market-based fishery regulation when it adopted 
a quota management system and allocated ITQs to a subset of domestic fisheries.
34 New Zealand authorities found that the biological models underlying the 
initial allocation of permanent allocation of fixed quotas needed to be 
adjusted over time in light of further evidence. As a result, in 1990, the 
commercial fishers received a revised ITQ based on a proportion of the total 
catch assigned annually.35 Over time, the original ITQ system has evolved into 
a comanagement system in which the fishers participate in gathering data and 
making policies. The system is still evolving and faces problems related to 
mismatches among the temporary and spatial dimensions of the property rights 
assigned to diverse groups.36<br>
<br>
In 1990, Iceland also introduced an ITQ 
system after multiple crises in Icelandic fishery stocks.37 Similar to the 
evolved New Zealand ITQ system, quotas do not assign fixed quantities but 
rather a share of the annual authorized catch level set by the government. The 
Iceland ITQ system appears to have averted the collapse of many valuable 
species for the Iceland fishery but has been less successful in restoring the 
Icelandic cod stocks. In his analysis of the long and conflict-ridden road to 
the Icelandic ITQ system, New York University professor of politics 
Thr&aacute;inn Eggertsson38 reflects that introducing major institutional 
changes is a &ldquo;subtle art&rdquo; compared to using a simpler 
&ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; formula. Designing a system in a top-down 
fashion and imposing it on the harvesters is not as successful as working with 
the users of a common-pool resource over time to develop a system that is 
well-matched to the ecological system as well as to the practices, norms, and 
long-term economic welfare of the participants, as was accomplished in New 
Zealand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Continued Overharvesting of Forest Resources<br>
<br>

Forest resources were not a focus of chapter 10 of the WCED&rsquo;s report, but 
they have become major news of recent times, especially given the impact of 
deforestation on global climate change. The MEA noted that the global area 
containing forested land has been cut in half over the past three centuries:<br>
<br><em>Forests have effectively disappeared in 25 countries, and another 29 
have lost more than 90% of their forest cover. Forest systems are associated 
with the regulation of 57% of total water runoff. About 4.6 billion people 
depend for all or some of their water on supplies from forest systems. From 
1990 to 2000, the global area of temperate forest increased by almost 3 million 
hectares per year, while deforestation in the tropics occurred at an average 
rate exceeding 2 million hectares per year over the past two decades.39&nbsp;
</em><br>
<br>
As Table 2 shows below, total hectares of forested land have 
steadily declined between 1990 and 2005. The only major increases in forested 
areas have occurred in East Asia, where China has, taken aggressive steps to 
reduce deforestation, and in the Caribbean, where substantial urban migration 
has led to reforestation of the highland areas of Puerto Rico and the Dominican 
Republic.40<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Whereas open access to oceans, compounded by roving bandits and ineffective 
governance in EEZs, is a major cause of overfishing, one cannot blame the 
problem of overharvested timber and deforestation on lack of ownership. 
Governmental units own most forested land, while private owners and, to a 
lesser extent, communities own the remaining forested land.41 Some policy 
analysts call for massive increases in the extent of government-owned protected 
areas as the only way to protect biodiversity and reduce deforestation.42 
Others have called into question whether officially designated protected areas 
are the best strategy for conserving the world&rsquo;s forests, arguing that 
many such &ldquo;paper parks&rdquo; are counterproductive.43 The International 
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that about 10&ndash;12 
percent of the world&rsquo;s forested lands are already in protected areas, and 
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations&rsquo; Global 
Forest Assessment estimates that 479 million hectares are inside protected 
areas.44 No question exists that some protected areas are very successful in 
protecting local forests, such as the Tikal National Park in Guatemala or the 
Machadinho d&rsquo;Oeste reserves in Rond&ocirc;nia, Brazil.45 On the other 
hand, deforestation threatens many areas around the world that are designated 
as protected but are not sufficiently budgeted or staffed to actually protect 
the forest.46<br>
<br>
For the past decade, colleagues from a dozen countries 
have been conducting studies of forests as part of the International Forestry 
Resources and Institutions research program.47 At each site, an 
interdisciplinary team measures trees, shrubs, and groundcover for a random 
sample of forest plots. Scholars knowledgeable about the local culture and 
history conduct participatory, in-depth studies of the activities, norms, and 
rules of local users. In an analysis of data from 76 government-owned forests 
that were legally designated as protected forests and 87 public, private, and 
community-owned forested lands that were not protected and were used for 
diverse purposes, no statistical difference existed between vegetation 
densities of officially designated, government-owned protected areas and all 
other property regimes.48<br>
<br>
Monitoring by officials or users of a forest 
makes a consistent difference in the forest conditions found in government and 
community forests.49 In fact, findings from multiple studies of government- or 
community-managed forests illustrate the crucial role monitoring played in 
impacting the cohesiveness of institutions, as well as the success of diverse 
forest management initiatives.50 When harvesting rules are effectively 
monitored and enforced, they prevent the spread of freeriding behavior, thereby 
instilling a sense of trust in the community.<br>
<br>
While many policy 
analysts think that extending private ownership of a common-pool resource is an 
assured method for long-term sustainability, private ownership of forests does 
not guarantee long-term protection. Much of the deforestation across the world 
has occurred as farmers have cleared their private land for agricultural 
purposes. In a study of three Amazonian states in Brazil (Acre, Par&aacute;, 
and Rond&ocirc;nia), Indiana University professor Eduardo Brondizio and 
colleagues used official deforestation data from the Brazilian-based National 
Institute for Space Research (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) to 
study the relative contribution of deforested patches of different sizes to 
total deforestation in each state.51 They found that clearings associated with 
smaller-sized holdings dominate the number of clearings, but the percent of 
land cleared in areas that are equal to or larger than 2,000 hectares exceeded 
85 percent of total deforested area in all three states (85.9 in Acre, 91.2 in 
Par&aacute;, and 94.5 in Rond&ocirc;nia). Thus, policies to reduce 
deforestation by communities and small-scale owners may not directly affect the 
extent of damage in this and many other regions affected by large-scale 
clearing of private land driven largely by commodity markets.<br>
<br>
Another 
recommendation related to both reducing deforestation and decreasing global 
warming is payment for environmental services (PES) for protecting biodiversity 
and forests.52 PES programs charge residents of the developed world for 
protecting ecologically diverse sites in the developing world. The ecological 
services of these developing countries serve the entire world, while the costs 
of preservation are borne by residents of the developed world. Proponents 
stress that PES policies are strongly related to sustainable development since 
payments could be allocated to poorer residents of tropical forests who have a 
financial, as well as a lifestyle, motivation to protect forests.<br>
<br>
Like 
other policies that are good in theory, working out arrangements that actually 
achieve both protection and increased income to the world&rsquo;s poor 
residents has been difficult. A study of the distribution of PES payments in 
Costa Rica, for example, found that payments tended to be allocated to large 
landowners with high incomes.53 A second study of the Costa Rica PES experiment 
based on remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) found that 
deforestation was not significantly less in regions where large allocations of 
PES payments had been invested.54 Hopefully, some of the initial experiments 
will provide some insight on how to achieve these complex goals.<br>
<br>

International Regimes for Sustainable Development<br>
<br>
Major international 
problems&mdash;such as cross-state rivers and lake pollution, transmission of 
air pollutants across long distances, and pressures to use outer space and the 
North and South Poles for imperial and commercial purposes&mdash;have 
challenged scholars and public officials to create international regimes for 
sustainable uses of these diverse commons.55 Some large-scale resources have 
been protected successfully through appropriate international governance 
regimes such as the Montreal Protocol on stratospheric ozone, which was signed 
in 1987&mdash;the same year the Brundtland report was released. Before then, 
the atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting substances were increasing 
faster than those of carbon dioxide; the increases slowed by the early 1990s, 
and the concentration appears to have stabilized in recent years.56 The 
international regime to reduce the human impact on stratospheric ozone is 
widely considered a successful effort to protect a global commons.<br>
<br>
The 
most pressing commons problem at a global level is the need to reduce 
greenhouse gas concentrations substantially. While no international regime that 
includes all countries has been implemented yet, a variety of approaches at 
multiple levels are under way.57 One of the largest regimes in geographic scope 
is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, which is a cap-and-trade program 
that sets an initial upper limit on emissions levels while assigning tradable 
property rights to a firm for this limit. In addition, many voluntary programs 
have been established on multiple scales and generated diverse results.58 
Considerable learning can be achieved from comparative study of their 
performances.<br>
<br>
Peter Barnes of the Tomales Bay Institute and colleagues 
have proposed an &ldquo;Earth Atmospheric Trust&rdquo; where a global 
cap-and-trade system is created for all greenhouse gas emissions and the funds 
obtained from auctioning off the permits are deposited in a &ldquo;trust 
fund.&rdquo; The fund would then invest in technological development to avert 
further carbon emissions and would also return some of the revenues to the 
peoples of the Earth.59 While this idea may not be accepted, many imaginative 
concepts need to be seriously discussed in the immediate future or dreams of 
sustainable development will be defeated by overlooking the threat of carbon 
emissions.<br>
<br>
<br>
What Have We Learned Since 1987?<br>
<br>
While many 
environmental and social problems are worse today than two decades ago, the 
authors of the WCED report should be congratulated for stimulating an essential 
dialogue among scholars, public officials, nongovernmental organizations, and 
citizens about strategies for achieving sustainable development. Without an 
active dialogue, the world would simply continue on the path toward an 
unsustainable future instead of searching for ways to avert the disaster that 
may ensue if we do not confront the massive overharvesting of fisheries and 
forests around the world, as well as the challenge of substantially reducing 
carbon emissions. As a result of extensive studies, however, we are learning 
some key lessons that, if applied, may enable the humans living on Earth to 
improve on their past performance.60<br>
<br>
No Cure-Alls<br>
<br>
The most 
important lesson that needs wide dissemination is that simple panaceas offered 
for solving problems related to the commons&mdash;whether they are for 
government, private, or community ownership&mdash;may work in some settings but 
fail in others.61 As examples have shown, quick fixes may cause more harm than 
good.62 Instead, officials and citizens need to craft institutions at multiple 
levels built on accurate data gathered at appropriate scales given the type of 
resource involved. Scholars have learned that ecosystems are diverse, complex, 
and uncertain, and sustainable management requires substantial investment in 
acquiring accurate data to learn more about patterns of interaction and adapt 
policies over time that are better fitted to particular systems.<br>
<br>

Further, policies also have to fit with the local culture and institutional 
environments of those who depend on ecosystems for their livelihood. Thus, 
specific institutional arrangements that work best in a particular location 
need to take into account the appropriate spatial and temporal scales as well 
as the type of interactions that occur on the ground. It is better to induce 
cooperation with institutional arrangements fitted to local ecosystems than to 
try to command it from afar.63 Users need to perceive and understand the rules 
as legitimate, or they will invest heavily in illegal harvesting. Effective 
monitoring by officials and users is an essential ingredient of sustainable 
common-pool resource institutions. The specific rules that facilitate low-cost 
and effective monitoring vary from setting to setting depending on ecological 
as well as social variables. Without active monitoring, however, the incentive 
to freeride on the cooperation of others can generate a tragedy of the commons.
<br><br>
Achieving Adaptive Governance<br>
<br>
The National Research Council 
has convened a series of meetings to assess what the global community has 
learned since the Brundtland report,64 Garrett Hardin&rsquo;s classic article,65
 and the extensive research undertaken by scholars from multiple disciplines 
related to the study of common-pool resources on multiple scales.66 Many 
scholars now recognize that simple &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; solutions imposed from 
the outside can make things worse rather than better. The task of designing 
sustainable, complex, coupled human-resource systems is indeed always a 
struggle. Five basic requirements, however, have been identified from extensive 
multidisciplinary studies of failed and successful regimes for governing 
diverse commons.67 These include<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Achieving accurate and 
relevant information</em>. Since the ecological, technological, economic, and 
social factors affecting the performance of any commons regime change over 
time, information about the conditions of the resource and its users also needs 
to be updated regularly. The challenge is combining accurate scientific 
understanding of coupled human-environmental systems and expected changes in 
these variables over time with information available to the users about their 
own future and the changes they can make in governance as well as use. New 
challenges arising from the increased speed and spread of human impacts require 
adaptations using a combination of scientific and local knowledge. New 
technologies, including remote sensing and GIS, provide more accurate 
information to localities that can be used for better decisionmaking. Building 
respectful collaborations between local users, public officials, and scientific 
experts is a vital requisite of adaptive governance.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>
Dealing with conflict.</em> In a coupled system that decides how resources are 
allocated, some conflicts over policies and their administration are highly 
likely. Governance systems that ignore the possibility of conflict over diverse 
issues may increase the likelihood of these conflicts, which could eventually 
erupt into major problems. Setting up strict hierarchical systems may increase 
the speed of decisions but ignore the interests of some participants who 
eventually erupt and potentially destroy an operational system. Designing 
multiple tiers of arenas that can engage in rapid discovery of conflicts and 
effective conflict resolution is essential.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Enhancing rule 
compliance</em>. Passing formal rules should not be confused with more informal 
rules that decisionmakers use day-to-day to manage a common-pool resource. 
Formal rules may become effective when participants consider them legitimate, 
fair, enforced, and likely to achieve intended purposes. External arrangements 
are rarely sufficient in and of themselves to effectively monitor a commons. 
Rather, the users of a commons, who are frequently widely dispersed, need to 
take some responsibility for monitoring.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Providing 
infrastructure</em>. Physical, technological, and institutional infrastructure 
is an essential investment to increase the effectiveness of internal operations 
within a commons as well as link any particular resource and its users to 
larger regimes. An overemphasis on engineered works such as highways, railways, 
electricity networks, and modern irrigation systems, however, especially if 
these works are designed without much awareness of the relevant institutional 
arrangements of a particular regime, may be counterproductive. For example, 
some modern irrigation systems are constructed without information on 
farmers&rsquo; property rights and cause considerable disruption.68 The diverse 
types of infrastructure need to work and change together over time.<br>
<br>

&bull;<em>Encourage adaptation and change</em>. Change is omnipresent. 
Institutional arrangements that are intended to be sustainable cannot be fixed 
for the &ldquo;long term,&rdquo; because they need to change to address past 
errors and cope with new developments.<br>
<br>
No blueprints exist for 
achieving these requirements. The specific designs of long-enduring governance 
regimes related to common-pool resources vary substantially from one another 
because of resource system diversity, as well as the social and economic 
settings of these resources. Rather, a general set of design principles has 
repeatedly been found to characterize small- to medium-sized institutional 
regimes that were sustainable over a long period of time.69 As shown below, the 
design principles do not specify any particular rule. In light of&nbsp; 
extensive research on the applicability of the design principles, an updated 
analysis is in process.70<br>
<br>
<br>
The Future of the Commons<br>
<br>
The 
global community has taken a long journey since 1987 in its efforts to 
understand how individuals cope with managing common resources, as well as 
other diverse economic and ecological situations as they try to improve their 
lives, the lives of their children, and lives of their children&rsquo;s 
children. We are now developing better tools for analyzing how changes in 
rules, biophysical structures, and community attributes affect resources over 
time.71 We must, however, be modest in our claims to understand these complex 
systems and our attemps to derive the best answers. We are fallible humans 
studying fallible human behavior within institutional structures constructed by 
other fallible humans. We should not act as if we know for certain how to 
achieve sustainable development. We can, however, recognize our growing 
capabilities and those of the individuals we study to experiment with rules, 
learn from the experiments, and, if the broader institutional and cultural 
milieu facilitates, gradually improve outcomes so they are sustainable over 
time.<br>
<br>
If the global community can apply these lessons, invest in 
adaptive governance, treasure institutional diversity as much as it treasures 
biodiversity, and see all policies as experiments that need to be evaluated 
over time based on new information, we may move toward a more sustainable path. 
Let us hope that the next two decades are more congruent with&nbsp; sustainable 
development than the two decades since the Brundtland report.<br>

48. Comparing forest measures such as the 
average diameter at breast height or basal area across ecological zones is 
misleading since these measures are strongly affected by precipitation, soils, 
elevation, and other factors that dramatically vary across zones. Thus, the 
forester or ecologist who supervises the collection of forest data at a set of 
International Forestry Resources and Institutions sites is asked after 
completing these measurements to rate the forest on a five-point scale from 
very sparse to very abundant. This generates a measure of forest condition that 
is comparable across different ecological regions. T. Hayes and E. Ostrom,

<p><br>
Design Principles for Governing Sustainable Resources<br>
<br>
The 
following principles are frequently observed in sustainable institutional 
regimes:<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Clearly defined boundaries</em>. The boundaries of 
the resource system, such as irrigation systems or fisheries, and the 
individuals or households with rights to harvest resource units are clearly 
defined.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Proportional equivalence between benefits and costs
</em>. Rules specifying the amount of resource products that a user is 
allocated are related to local conditions and rules requiring labor, materials, 
and/or money inputs.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Collective-choice arrangements</em>. 
Many of the individuals affected by harvesting and protection rules are 
included in the group who can modify these rules.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Monitoring
</em>. Monitors, who actively audit biophysical conditions and user behavior, 
are at least partially accountable to users and/or are users themselves.<br>

<br>&bull; <em>Graduated sanctions</em>. Users who violate rules-in-use are 
likely to receive graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context 
of the offense) from other users, officials accountable to these users, or both.
<br><br>
&bull; <em>Conflict-resolution mechanisms</em>. Users and their 
officials have rapid access to low-cost, local arenas to resolve conflict among 
users or between users and officials.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Minimal recognition 
of rights to organize</em>. The rights of users to devise their own 
institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities, and users 
have long-term tenure rights to the resource.<br>
<br>
&bull; <em>Nested 
enterprises (for resources that are parts of larger systems)</em>. 
Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and 
governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises.
