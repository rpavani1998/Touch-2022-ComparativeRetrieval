<h1>Global Patterns and Predictions of Seafloor Biomass Using Random Forests
</h1>  A comprehensive seafloor biomass and abundance database has been 
constructed from 24 oceanographic institutions worldwide within the Census of 
Marine Life (CoML) field projects. The machine-learning algorithm, Random 
Forests, was employed to model and predict seafloor standing stocks from 
surface primary production, water-column integrated and export particulate 
organic matter (POM), seafloor relief, and bottom water properties. The 
predictive models explain 63% to 88% of stock variance among the major size 
groups. Individual and composite maps of predicted global seafloor biomass and 
abundance are generated for bacteria, meiofauna, macrofauna, and megafauna 
(invertebrates and fishes). Patterns of benthic standing stocks were positive 
functions of surface primary production and delivery of the particulate organic 
carbon (POC) flux to the seafloor. At a regional scale, the census maps 
illustrate that integrated biomass is highest at the poles, on continental 
margins associated with coastal upwelling and with broad zones associated with 
equatorial divergence. Lowest values are consistently encountered on the 
central abyssal plains of major ocean basins The shift of biomass dominance 
groups with depth is shown to be affected by the decrease in average body size 
rather than abundance, presumably due to decrease in quantity and quality of 
food supply. This biomass census and associated maps are vital components of 
mechanistic deep-sea food web models and global carbon cycling, and as such 
provide fundamental information that can be incorporated into evidence-based 
management. <br>

<h3>Introduction&nbsp;Top</h3> 
<h4>Rationale</h4> 
<p>A &lsquo;census&rsquo;, according to our dictionaries, was originally a 
counting of individuals for the purpose of taxation. The Census of Marine Life 
(CoML) is on the other hand an attempt to make a comprehensive assessment of 
what lives in the world's oceans. CoML is attempting to document, describe, 
list, archive and map as many species of organisms as possible in all marine 
ecosystems, independent of an individual species' population size. A natural 
by-product of CoML however has been new tabulations of animal abundances and 
biomass by CoML field projects. The purpose of this CoML biomass synthesis has 
been to capture all the new information on biomass that has been uncovered 
during CoML into a single data base, independent of species composition. This 
project has thus archived and mapped a broad spectrum of biomass data from CoML 
projects from around the world, added data from a number of previous 
comprehensive reviews, and, as a result, produced maps of biomass of a limited 
number of size groups living on the sea floor on a world wide basis.</p> 
<p>While the causes of biodiversity remain obscure to a large degree, there is 
general agreement that biomass is a function of food supply to or within any 
particular habitat. As a result, standing stock biomass has been used as a 
surrogate for biomass production and carbon flow to and through an ecosystem, 
without necessarily defining the taxa contributing to the biomass. On the other 
hand, by analyzing the statistical relationships of diversity to biomass, it 
might be possible to make some practical inferences about the effects that 
productivity might have on diversity[1], as this is an open question that has 
generated considerable conjecture[2]. While the biomass census is not related 
to &lsquo;taxation&rsquo; in the classic sense, it directly links marine 
populations to carbon as an ecosystem model currency. Inorganic carbon is fixed 
into organic-rich compounds by photosynthesis and then transferred through food 
webs where it has a variety of fates, usually a return to CO2. However, it is 
also harvested by fishers and it thus ends up in markets around the world. A 
biomass census therefore has relevance to societies because human populations 
are putting a &lsquo;tax&rsquo; on the ocean biota in the form of valuable 
protein in fisheries products.</p> 
<h4>Historical background</h4> 
<p>The earliest quantitative sampling of the sea floor began at the beginning 
of the 20th century as an attempt to determine food resources available to 
bottom-dwelling fish in European waters[3], [4]. A good review of the 
mechanical instruments developed for the early shallow-water surveys[5] 
pictures a wide variety of grab-like samplers, many still in use today. By the 
middle of the 20th century, the macrofauna of many continental shelves and 
estuaries had been sampled quantitatively by a relatively standard set of 
instruments. For demersal fishes and vagile megafaunal invertebrates, the most 
common sampling methods are trawling and photography. Both methods have 
weaknesses: for example, trawling tends to capture only surface-dwelling and 
slow species. It may be impossible to positively identify animals to species 
from photographs. However, to this day neither is fool proof. With smaller 
forms (meiofauna, microfauna, bacteria and viruses), sampling problems are 
solved seemingly easily by utilizing small-diameter cores, but care has to be 
taken not to lose organisms by either washing or bow-wake of sampling devices. 
For these groups, the problem is that they have not yet been sampled 
comprehensively on global or ocean-basin scales.</p> 
<p>Generalizations about the controls of sea floor biomass began to emerge by 
the middle of the 20th century. Expeditions sponsored by Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics (USSR: dissolved in 1991) reached every corner of the 
globe. This large body of work concluded that biomass declines sharply with 
depth and with distance from land. They observed that high latitudes tended to 
have higher biomass than low latitudes. The major food supply to both pelagic 
and sea floor communities was the rain of particulate detritus, enhanced by a 
ladder of vertical migration[6]. Sea floor biomass likewise declines 
precipitously with depth, but is also tightly coupled to primary production in 
surface layers. Regression equations of the variation in benthic biomass as a 
function of depth and primary production established in the 1970's initially 
(reviewed in[7]) are still reasonable estimates of deep benthic biomass today 
[8]. The slopes of the biomass regressions have been equated to the rate at 
which the delivery of POC to the sea floor declines, but the height or zero 
intercept of the regression line is a function of the mean primary production 
in the photic zone.</p> 
<p>Previous reviews of seafloor standing stocks focused on bathymetric 
standing stock patterns in which the distribution of biomass and abundance was 
fitted to a linear function of water depth or direct measurement of sinking 
particle flux[7], [8], [9], [10]. Applying such equations is conceptually 
intuitive but the relationships tend sometimes to fall apart in large scale 
predictive mapping. In this paper, we explore a novel machine-learning 
algorithm, Random Forests[11], to model the complex and potentially non-linear 
relationships between oceanic properties and seafloor standing stocks. Random 
Forests (RF) is a data mining method widely used in the fields of bioinformatics
[12], speech recognition [13], and drug design and development [14]. Recently 
RF is gaining popularity in terrestrial ecology[15], [16], [17]; however, so 
far, only a handful of studies have applied RF in marine ecosystems[18], [19]. 
In short, RF, as the name suggested, is an ensemble of many decision trees with 
binary divisions. Each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of response 
variable and each node is guided by a predictor value to maximize differences 
in offspring branches. The fit of the tree is examined using the data not in 
the bootstrap selection; hence, cross-validation with external data is not 
necessary. Predictive accuracy requires low bias and low correlation between 
decision trees[11]. RF achieves these by growing a large number of trees and 
then averaging the predictions. At the same time, the node decision is chosen 
from a random subset of predictors to make the trees look as different as 
possible. RF does not assume any data distribution and does not require formal 
selection of predictors. RF is robust to outlier and unbalanced data, making it 
a better choice than traditional statistical methods[12].</p> 
<h3>Materials and Methods&nbsp;Top</h3> 
<h4>Response Variables</h4> 
<p>Biomass and abundance of bacteria, meiofauna, macrofauna, megafauna 
(invertebrates+fishes), invertebrates, and fishes were assembled from 
literature and the Census of Marine Life (CoML) field projects (Figure 1 and 
Appendix S1). The &ldquo;CoML Fresh Biomass Database&rdquo; includes 4872 
biomass records, 5511 abundance records, and 4196 records with both biomass and 
abundance from 175 studies. Additional datasets include nematodes (230 records 
from 10 studies) and pelagic decapods (17 records from 1 study); however, they 
were not included in this analysis. The complete list of references and 
detailed data information are available inAppendix S1 and File S1.</p>

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015323.g001 <br>

<p>Categories of benthic fauna are usually defined by size classes. In this 
paper, we refer to the term &ldquo;bacteria&rdquo; to include both bacterial 
and archaeal domains. We have not included viruses. The metazoan meiofauna and 
macrofauna are small infauna invertebrates sampled by core or grab devices and 
retained on 20 to 74-&micro;m and 250 to 520-&micro;m sieves, respectively. 
Megafauna refers to large epibenthic invertebrates and demersal fishes (usually 
larger than 1 cm) caught or recorded by bottom trawling and photographic 
survey. Many studies deal with trawl invertebrates and fishes separately; 
hence, 3 categories were created for the megafauna, including the invertebrates 
plus fishes, invertebrates, and fishes. Here the &ldquo;megafauna&rdquo; 
dataset includes both invertebrates and fishes. Estimates of meiofaunal and 
macrofaunal standing stocks are affected by the gear design, sampling area, and 
sieve sizes[7], [20], [21], [22]. These factors however have been suggested to 
be minor compared to water depth at a global scale and do not significantly 
affect the overall level and pattern of stock-depth relationships[2], [8]. Only 
studies reporting standing stocks for the whole assemblage of a size category 
were used in these analyses. Benthic foraminiferans were not included due to 
difficulty differentiating between living biomass from empty tests or shells[8],
[9]. Throughout this analysis, the abundance was standardized to cells (for 
bacteria) or individuals (for meiofauna, macrofauna, and megafauna) per square 
meter. The biomass was standardized to milligrams carbon per square meter using 
appropriate conversion factors from wet or dry weight to organic carbon weight
[7], [9].</p> 
<h4>Environmental Predictors</h4> 
<p>Environmental variables with global coverage were utilized to characterize 
1) the surface ocean climate relating to phytoplankton production, 2) water 
column processes associated with export POC flux, 3) bottom water properties 
characterizing the seafloor habitats, and 4) seafloor relief (water depth) as a 
proxy of declining export POC flux arriving at the ocean floor (Table 1 and 
Figure S1). Contemporaneous environmental and standing stocks data were not 
always available; therefore, mean and standard deviation (S.D.) of the 
predictors were calculated for the longest time periods possible. The variables 
are listed as:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Primary productivity variables: Decadal mean and standard deviation (S.D.) 
of monthly net primary production (NPP) models (cbpm, vgpm), and the data 
inputs for the NPP models[23], [24] including chlorophyll concentration (chl), 
sea surface temperature (sst), photosynthetic available irradiance (par), mixed 
layer depth (mld), particle backscatter (bbp), phytoplankton growth rate 
(growth), and carbon concentration (carbon), all calculated between years of 
1998 and 2007. The monthly data were obtained from the Ocean Productivity 
Group, Oregon State University, as products of the Sea Viewing Wide 
Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS r2009.1) and Advanced Very High Resolution 
Radiometer (AVHRR).</li> 
<li>Water column processes: Decadal mean of water-column integrated total 
carbon (int.c) and nitrogen (int.n), detrital carbon (det.c) and nitrogen 
(det.n), phytoplankton (phyt) and zooplankton (zoop), as well as export flux of 
detrital carbon (det.flx.c) and nitrogen (det.flx.n), obtained from a 10-year 
simulation of monthly model outputs from 1995 to 2004 using Ocean Circulation 
and Climate Advanced Model (OCCAM) driven by a nitrogen based Nutrient 
Phytoplankton Zooplankton Detritus (NPZD) Model[25]. </li> 
<li>Bottom water properties: Annual mean and seasonal standard deviation 
(S.D.) of bottom water temperature, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and 
silicate concentration were obtained from World Ocean Atlas 2009, NOAA National 
Oceanographic Data Center.</li> 
<li>Global ocean depths were obtained from the ETOPO1 Global Relief Model, 
NOAA National Geophysical Data Center[26]. </li> </ol>

<h4>Data Analyses and Modeling</h4> 
<p>We used partial regression analysis to examine the relationships between 
standing stocks and depth when the latitude and longitude are held constant. 
The multiple regression residuals of stocks against latitude and longitude were 
used as dependent variables to regress against depth. To bring the dependent 
variable back to an appropriate scale, the y-intercept from the multiple 
regression was added to the residuals. The partial regression was also used in 
the pre-treatment of the depth-integrated bacteria data to standardize sediment 
penetration depths (from 0.5 to 29.5 cm; &gt;83% are between 5 and 15 cm). 
Similar approaches has been developed and tested in Rex et al.[8].</p> 
<p>A stochastic model between standing stocks and 39 environmental predictors (
Table 1 and Figure S1) was constructed using Random Forests (RF) [11]. RF is a 
member of Regression Tree Analyses (RTA)[27]. In RTA, the response variable 
(standing stocks) is recursively partitioned into small successive binary 
splits. Each split is based on a single value of predictor from an exhaustive 
search of all available predictors to maximize the differences between the 
offspring branches. In RF, the response variable was bootstrap resampled before 
conducting RTA to generate large numbers of un-pruned decision trees (1000 
trees in this study). Unlike traditional RTA, the RF algorithm searches the 
best split from a random subset of predictors (1/3 of all variables) and the 
prediction can be made from new data (environmental) by averaging the model 
outputs of all trees. At each bootstrap resampling step, 2/3 of the data 
(in-bag) were selected to build the decision tree. The other 1/3 of the data 
(out-of-bag, or OOB) were used to carry out an internal examination of model 
(decision tree) prediction error and estimate variable importance. The OOB data 
can generate predictions using the tree grown from the in-bag data. These OOB 
predictions were aggregated (by averaging the outputs of all trees) to compare 
with the observations and estimated the prediction error. The performance of 
the RF model was examined as percent variance explained: R2 = 1&ndash; MSEOOB
/observed variance, where MSEOOB is the mean square error between observations 
and OOB predictions. Predictor Importance was determined by how much worse the 
OOB predictions can be if the data for that predictor are randomly permuted. 
This essentially mimicked what would happen with or without the help of that 
predictor. The increase of prediction error (MSEOOB) after the permutation was 
used to measure its contribution to the prediction accuracy. This accuracy 
importance measure (increase of MSEOOB) was computed for each tree and averaged 
over the forest (1000 trees).</p> 
<h4>Construction of Random Forest Models</h4> 
<p>Standing stocks (biomass and abundance) were logarithm (base 10) 
transformed before conducting RF analysis. Environmental data were extracted 
based on the latitude and longitude of the stock records by averaging a box of 
size 3&times;3 or 1&times;1 cells (Table 1). Mean value of the box was matched 
to the corresponding stocks record. RF algorithm was then run independently on 
each of the 12 datasets. Most primary productivity predictors have declining 
temporal coverage at the high latitudes between years of 1998 and 2007 due to 
prolonged winter darkness or cloud cover preventing SeaWiFS ocean color 
measurements (Figure S2). This can be a source of error during the RF modeling, 
because decadal mean and standard deviation of the predictors was only 
calculated from the available monthly data. In order to evaluate the model 
stability, we conducted 4 RF simulations for each dataset. The simulations were 
based on different data selection scenarios, including: 1) all standing stocks 
and environmental data were included; 2) only data calculated from &gt;30 
months of SeaWiFS measurements were included; 3) only data calculated from 
&gt;60 months of SeaWiFS measurements were included; 4) only data calculated 
from &gt;90 months of SeaWiFS measurements were included. In other words, 
Scenario 1 retained all the data and Scenario 4 excluded much of the high 
latitude data (&gt;50&deg;N or S, seeFigure S2). The mean and standard 
deviation (S.D.) of the model performance (R2) and variable importance were 
calculated to evaluate the model sensitivity. In the following text, the 
&ldquo;simulations&rdquo; refer to the RF runs under the 4 data selection 
scenarios.</p> 
<h4>Global Prediction of Seafloor Standing Stocks</h4> 
<p>Environmental data were averaged to the same grid resolution (1 arc degree 
grids) before using them as model inputs for global standing stocks predictions 
(Figure S1). For each dataset, 4 global predictions were generated from RF 
simulations. The mean and coefficient of variation (S.D./mean * 100%) were 
calculated for each grid to optimize the predictions and examine the output 
stability. In order to produce a smooth predicted surface, the predictions were 
interpolated to 0.1 degree cell resolution using Inverse Distance Weighting 
(IDW). The predicted map of standing stocks is displayed in color classes using 
Jenks Natural Breaks Optimization method to maximize the differences between 
the classes. The global integral of benthic biomass was integrated from each 
cell value multipling the cell area on predicted map based on equidistant 
cylindrical projection. The calculations were based on the formula: Global 
integral = &Sigma; map cell value (in per unit area) * cell area at equator 
(~12343 km2) * cosine (latitude). Statistical analyses and RF modeling used R 
2.11.0[28] and R package randomForest [29]. Geostatistical analyses and mapping 
used ESRI&reg; ArcMap&trade; 9.2 and R package sp[30].</p> 
<h3>Results&nbsp;Top</h3> 
<h4>Partial linear regressions</h4> 
<p>Our results confirmed the conclusions of Rex et al. [8] and suggested 
significantly negative log-linear relationships of biomass, abundance, and body 
size for 3 large size classes with depth; however, none of these parameters 
showed statistically significant depth dependency for bacteria (Table 2). We 
adapted figure legends from Rex et al.[8] and raised the y-intercepts of their 
regression equations 3 orders of magnitude (converting the unit from g C m
&minus;2 to mg C m&minus;2) for comparison with our current results. Our 
regression y-intercepts were slightly lower than the previous synthesis (2.4 
vs. 2.5 for bacteria; 2.2 vs. 2.3 for meiofauna; 3.1 vs. 3.2 for macrofauna; 
1.8 vs. 2.3 for megafauna.), while the rate of decline biomass with depth was 
steeper for meiofauna (&minus;2.4&times;10&minus;4 vs. &minus;1.7&times;10
&minus;4) and macrofauna (&minus;5.2&times;10&minus;4 vs. &minus;4.5&times;10
&minus;4), but more gradual for megafauna (&minus;3.1&times;10&minus;4 vs. 
&minus;3.9&times;10&minus;4, Table 2). The biomass hierarchy among size groups 
was similar between the 2 studies: macrofauna dominated the shelves and 
bacteria and meiofauna dominated the abyssal plains (Figure 2). The only 
apparent difference was a cross of the regression lines between macrofauna and 
megafauna at ~6000 m depth, or a reversal of their biomass hierarchies. The 
lower y-intercepts and steeper slopes for the meiofauna and macrofauna 
suggested that the biomass levels were lower in this study than in the previous 
synthesis. The rate of declining biomass with depth was highest for macrofauna, 
followed by megafauna and meiofauna. Except for meiofauna, the y-intercept of 
the abundance-depth regressions were slightly lower in this study (13.3 vs. 
14.1 for bacteria; 3.5 vs. 3.6 for macrofauna; &minus;0.7 vs. &minus;0.3 for 
megafauna.) while the slopes were more gradual (&minus;2&times;10&minus;4 vs. 
&minus;2.8&times;10&minus;4 for macrofauna; &minus;2.8&times;10&minus;4 vs. 
&minus;3.7&times;10&minus;4 for megafauna, Table 2). The rate of declining 
abundance with depth was sharpest for megafauna, followed by macrofauna and 
meiofauna (Figure 3, Table 2). Average body size for each size class was 
calculated as biomass divided by abundance. The average sizes of all 3 large 
groups showed significant depth dependency with the rates of declining mean 
size with depth being the most rapid for macrofauna, followed by megafauna and 
meiofauna (Table 2 and Figure 4). The rapid decline in average macrofaunal size 
was likely overestimated at abyssal depths, because the regression line was 
apparently higher at shelf depths due to extremely large values (&gt;10 mg C 
individual&minus;1) at high latitude areas.</p>

<h4>Random Forests</h4> 
<p>On average, RF models explained 78% to 81% of total variance (R2) for 
bacteria, meiofauna, and macrofauna biomass (Figure 5a). Compared to the small 
size classes, the RF performance was subordinate for megafauna, invertebrates, 
and fishes, in which the models only explained 63% to 68% of the observed 
biomass variance. The RF algorithm appears to perform better for abundance with 
the models explaining 77% to 88% of total variance for each size class. The RF 
performance among different simulation scenarios was generally stable (S.D 
&le;1%). The variability was only slightly higher for macrofauna and 
invertebrates with S.D. between 2% to 3%. A scatter plot between observed and 
predicted biomass (Figure 5b) suggests that the OOB predictions were in proper 
scale (regression slopes = ~1) with modest deviations from the observations.</p>

<p>We combined predictor importance from bacteria, meiofauna, macrofauna, and 
megafauna (Figure S3) to examine the predictor importance on total benthic 
biomass. This was only done for the biomass datasets because they were 
converted to a unified currency in mg C per square meter. With the exception of 
bacteria, depth was ranked highly important for the 3 larger size classes (
Figure 6). To our surprise, neither net primary production (vgpm, cbpm) nor 
flux of detrital organic matter to seafloor (det.c.flx, det.n.flx) was 
considered the most important for the total benthic biomass. Instead, water 
depth and the data inputs for the NPP models (carbon, bbp, sst, par, mld, chl) 
were among the top 10 most important variables. Nonetheless, when the predictor 
importance was examined for the size classes, NPP models (vgpm, cbpm) had 
considerable importance for bacterial, meiofaunal, and macrofaunal biomass but 
appeared less important for megafaunal biomass. Decadal mean and S.D. of the 
predictors generally ranked in similar orders suggesting high correlation 
between them; however, it may also suggest that overall levels and seasonal 
fluctuations of the predictors were both important in predicting the biomass. 
The predictors associated with water column processes (Table 1) appeared not 
significant to the total biomass; however, the decadal mean of water 
column-integrated zooplankton (zoop.mean), total organic matter (int.c.mean, 
int.n.mean), and detrital organic matter (det.c.mean, det.n.mean), were among 
the most important predictors for megafaunal standing stocks, especially for 
abundance (seeFigure S3d and Figure S4d). Annual mean salinity (salin.mean) was 
the only bottom water property ranked within the top 10 most important 
predictors for the total biomass (Figure 6).</p>

square error (MSEOOB) indicates the contribution to RF prediction accuracy for 
that variable.</p> doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015323.g006 <br>

<h4>Patterns of Predicted Biomass</h4> 
<p>No biomass predictions were given near the northern tip of the Arctic Ocean 
and part of the Antarctic shores due to a lack of SeaWiFS satellite data as a 
result of permanent sea ice cover (Figure S2). The predictions of major size 
classes (Figure S5a, b, c, d) were combined to estimate the total benthic 
biomass. The maximum biomass of 2.6 to 10 g C per square meter occurred on the 
shelves of the north frigid zones (e.g. Kara Sea, Siberian Sea, and 
Chukchi/Bering Sea) and temperate areas (e.g. Yellow sea and North Sea, see
Figure 7, red color). These predictions however were lower than the empirical 
maximum found in the Chukchi/Bering Sea, where the infauna biomass as high as 
40 to 100 g C m&minus;2 were reported [31]. The discrepancy is probably 
associated with high prediction uncertainty in the areas (C.V. = 15% to 22%,
Figure 8) or unexplained variability in the models (Figure 5a). The weaker 
maximum (orange color) between 1.3 to 2.5 g C per square meter occurred on the 
polar to temperate shelves and subtropical coastal areas (e.g. East/South China 
Sea, Arabian Sea, and Persian Gulf). The lowest biomass prediction between 30 
and 80 mg C per square meter occurred on the abyssal plains of the Pacific, 
Atlantic, and Indian Ocean; however, relatively higher biomass was predicted on 
the seafloor of the east side of Pacific and Atlantic basins under the 
productive equatorial divergence and coastal upwelling areas[32]. For these 
largest ocean areas, the model outputs were stable among 4 RF simulations with 
S.D. less than 10% of the mean predictions (Figure 8, light blue to dark blue 
colors). Any high uncertainties were usually associated with high predicted 
biomass. The Southern Ocean for example had the highest uncertainty with S.D. 
between 15% and 26% of the mean (yellow to red class), where most of the 
uncertainty was derived from the unstable predictions for macrofauna biomass (
Figure S6). The S.D. of some Arctic shelves were slightly lower than the 
Southern Ocean, mostly between 11% and 18% of the mean (green to yellow class,
Figure 8). The log10 predictied biomass (mg C m&minus;2) and abundance 
(individual m&minus;2) for each size class are available in File S2 and File S3
, respectively. Global maps showing the mean of abundance prediction and 
coefficient of variation for each size class are given inFigure S7 and Figure S8
, respectively.</p>

<p>A total of 110.3&plusmn;48.2 (Mean &plusmn; S.D. from 4 RF simulations) 
megatons of living carbon biomass were estimated based on the global integral 
of the predicted map cells (Figure 7), in which bacteria, meiofauna, 
macrofauna, and megafauna contributed 31.4%, 12.9%, 50.7%, and 5% of the global 
integral, respectively. Previous workers estimated that global POC flux to the 
seafloor was 3.76 to 3.91 megaton C day&minus;1 [25], [33] and carbon burial 
was about 0.82 megaton C day&minus;1 [33]. By dividing the total mass by the 
flux[34], [35], we estimated that the mean residence time for the seafloor 
living carbon was 36.6&plusmn;16 days (mean &plusmn;S.D.). Generally, the 
predictions were highest on the continental shelves, which account for 21.1% of 
the global integral biomass but cover merely 5.9% of the total seafloor area 
(&le;200 m water depth,Figure 9a). Water depths deeper than 3000 m harbor more 
then 50% of the global benthic biomass due to their vast area (covering &gt;75% 
of seafloor). The predictions were also high at high latitudes (&gt; 60&deg;N 
or S) and the tropical ocean (&lt;23.5&deg;N or S) of the northern and southern 
hemisphere, in which the biomass contributed 25.4% and 28.8% of the global 
integral on 13.4% and 40.7% of the ocean area, respectively (Figure 9b). As a 
rule of thumb, the total biomass of all size classes (except for bacteria) 
dissipates along the continental margins to the abyssal plains (Figure 2) but 
this is accompanied by a major shift in size classes in the predictions, with 
the biomass composition changing from metazoan dominated (meiofauna + 
macrofauna) for the first couple hundred-meter zonal integrals to bacteria 
dominated on the abyssal plain (Figure 9a). Along the latitudinal zonal 
integrals, the biomass composition also shifted from the majority of large-size 
macrofauna at high latitudes to the small-size meiofauna and bacteria dominated 
at the tropics (Figure 9b).</p>

<p>Regional variability among the major ocean basin is apparent when predicted 
biomass was plotted against depth (Figure 10). Generally, the declining trends 
of biomass with depth were similar but the overall levels differed by basin, 
with the predictions bounded between the higher end of the Southern Ocean and 
the lower end of the Mediterranean Sea (Figure 10h). In the Atlantic and Arctic 
Ocean, high density at bathyal depths near the upper end of the 
biomass&ndash;depth distribution (Figure 10a, e) appeared responsible for 
elevated biomass levels above the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico (
Figure 10). These high values corresponded to the high biomass predictions in 
the North Atlantic to Arctic Ocean (Figure 7) under the productive subpolar 
gyre north of the Gulf Stream[32]. The high density at the bottom of the 
biomass-depth distribution for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Figure 10a, b) 
illustrates the low predicted biomass on the vast abyssal plains. In the Indian 
Ocean, the extraordinary high predicted values between ~1200 to 3000-m water 
depths (Figure 10c) single out the Oman and Pakistan Margin, where the benthic 
biomass between 1.3 and 2.5 g C per square meter is as high as continental 
shelf values (Figure 7, orange color). We believe that the high predictions 
derive mainly from the monsoon dynamics and seasonal fluctuation of export POC 
flux[36] rather than the mid-water Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ), because 
resolution of our bottom oxygen data (Table 1) is probably not sufficient to 
detect OMZ influences. At hadal depths (&gt;6000 m), the biomass predictions 
were meager in general (&lt;0.2 g C m&minus;2, Figure 10a, b); however, 
relatively high values (0.5~0.7 g C m&minus;2) were predicted near the 
Kurile-Kamchatka Trench of the Northwest Pacific Basin (Figure 10b) and the 
South Sandwich Trench near the southern tip of the South America and Antarctic 
Peninsula (Figure 10d).</p>

<h3>Discussion&nbsp;Top</h3> 
<h4>Observed and Predicted Patterns</h4> 
<p>In this study, classic log-linear declines of seafloor biomass and 
abundance with depth were demonstrated for meiofauna, macrofauna, and megafauna
[7], [8], [9]. These widely recognized patterns have been attributed to the 
decreasing quantity and quality of sinking phytodetritus with increasing depth 
and distance from the productive coastal waters and river runoff[7], [37]. 
Although the selection pressure (food limitation) may be the same, responses 
differed among the size groups along the depth gradients, showing disparate 
rates of declining biomass and shifts of biomass hierarchy from macrofauna 
domination on the shelves and upper slope to meiofauna and bacteria domination 
on the abyssal plains[8], [34], [35], [38]. Figure 4 suggests that these 
observed biomass patterns among size groups are governed by the rate of 
declining average body size rather than by the rate of declining abundance with 
depth. The decrease of animal size in the deep-sea has been explained by energy 
constraints and the need to maintain viable density for successful reproduction
[8], [39]. Recent evidence from terrestrial environments also suggests a 
potential link between the animal body size and food quality[40]. It has been 
suggested that the macrofauna may compete for fresh settled phytodetritus with 
bacteria[41], [42], [43], [44], while the meiofauna may prefer bacterial carbon 
over phytodetitus[45]. Hence, the rapid decline of macrofaual average size with 
depth could be related to the exponential decrease of sinking detrital carbon 
or the refractory organic matter in the deep-sea sediments. The meiofauna, on 
the contrary, may be less affected by the deterioration of the food influx and 
experienced a relatively gradual decline of average size with depth; however, 
the actual causes of this discrepancy in size-structure remain unclear.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, our predicted biomass not only has captured the shifts of 
dominant size groups with depth but also with latitude (Figure 9), supporting 
the dominance of macrofaunal biomass[31], [46] and meager importance of 
bacteria at the high latitudes[47] due, potentially, to strong benthic-pelagic 
coupling, short food chain, and weaker microbial loop in the overlying water[48]
,[49]. Other intriguing features from our predictions include the apparent 
increase of bacterial, meiofaunal, and decrease of macrofaunal biomass 
integrals from high latitudes toward the tropical oceans (Figure 9b). In fact, 
the increasing bacterial and meiofaunal integrals were a function of the 
increasing cell areas toward the equator due to the map projection, which in 
turn makes the decrease of macrofaunal integrals seemingly even more 
convincing. This cross-latitude comparison however could be biased by a 
potential interaction with water depth, because the tropical oceans comprise 
many deep basins and the high latitudes, such as Chukchi/Bering Sea, have 
extended shelf areas. We tested this by using partial regression to 
statistically remove the effect of water depth and longitude. When depth was 
held constant, macrofaunal biomass could be fitted to a positive parabolic 
function of latitude (R2 = 0.17, P&lt;0.001), supporting the elevated 
macrofaunal biomass at high latitudes[7].</p> 
<p>From a global perspective, the results of regressions (Figures 2, 3, 4) 
reinforced the weak to no depth-dependency of bacterial standing stocks[8], [50]
,[51]. Despite immense variation in declining POC flux at depth, the surface 
sediments supported a remarkably constant bacterial stock spanning only ~2 
orders of magnitude difference worldwide (30 to 2220 mg C m&minus;2 and 
1.3&times;1012 to 1.9&times;1014 cells m&minus;2, 5th to 95th percentile, n = 
525); nonetheless, regional and local studies in our database do indicate 
dependency of bacterial standing stocks with depth or POC flux[10], [52], [53]. 
The high bacterial stocks at the supposedly depauperate abyssal depths have 
been attributed to their barophilic adaption[54], [55]. As bacteria are 
transported with phytoditrital aggregates to the deep sea[56], a large number 
of the bacteria could be dormant or inactive because of the extreme pressure 
and frigid temperature[57], [58], while the active microbes are supported by 
carbon deposition flux[43], viral lysis of the infected prokaryotes [59], 
extracellular enzymatic activities[60], [61], and benthic metazoan sloppy 
feeding[44]. It is worth noting that many studies have applied a uniformed 
conversion factor to estimate the biomass from bacterial numbers, which may be 
the main reason that no statistical relationship was detected between the 
bacterial cell size and water depth (Figure 4). Based on direct measurements of 
the cell volume over a wide range of water depths in the northern Gulf of 
Mexico, Deming and Carpenter[52] concluded that the greater ocean depths 
generally harbored smaller bacterial cells despite the abundance remaining 
constant. That is, the constancy of bacterial biomass with depth that we 
observed here could be an artifact because the cell volumes were not measured 
directly at all depths. To our surprise, even though no depth-dependency was 
evident for the bacterial standing stocks, the RF algorithm performed well in 
predicting the bacterial biomass (R2 = 79&plusmn;0.6%) and abundance (R2 = 
81&plusmn;1.2%, mean&plusmn;S.D, n = 4). High predictor importance of sea 
surface temperature (sst), irradiance (par), mixed layer depth (mld), and 
carbon-based primary production model (cbpm) support the idea that the 
sedimentary bacterial biomass may be imported in the form of sinking particles
[54], [56]. The high bacterial biomass predictions on the abyssal plains of 
semi-enclosed basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Arabian Sea, and East 
Mediterranean (Figure S5a), supported potential lateral advection of detritus 
from the margins due to relatively large area of shelves and margins compared 
to basin volume[52].</p> 
<h4>Anomalies not explained by Random Forests</h4> 
<p>Although multiple predictors were obtained to cover as many aspects and 
processes that could affect the distribution of benthic standing stocks, around 
19% to 36% of observed variances are still unexplainable in the current RF 
models. Some important predictors, such as sediment grain size[62], organic 
composition[63], bioturbation [64], [65], and community oxygen demand [66], [67]
, were not included due to sparse data availability; others such as oxygen 
minimums[68], [69] or abrupt changes in thermal dynamic regimes [70], could 
also be left undetected due to the coarse resolution in available hydrographic 
data. Nevertheless, the largest unexplained variability was probably derived 
from our non-contemporaneous predictors that do not account for the seasonal or 
inter-annual changes of benthic standing stocks as a result of climate-induced 
variations on productivity and export POC flux[71], [72]. The seafloor 
organisms depend on diverse sources of energy[73], including large food falls 
[74], hydrocarbons from cold seeps and hydrothermal vents [75], [76], lateral 
resource advection from continental margins[77], accumulation of organic matter 
in submarine canyons[78] and trenches [79], and rapid energy transfers on 
seamounts[80]. In addition, benthic foraminifera, sometimes accounting for more 
than 50% of eukaryote biomass[81], are not included in our datasets. These 
anomalies are not in the scope of this analysis and should be estimated 
separately elsewhere in a global context. For example, at the head of the New 
Zealand's Kaikoura Canyon (data not in the database), the extremely high 
macrofauna and megafauna biomass (89 g C m&minus;2) was about 100-fold more 
than our total biomass prediction (0.94 g C m&minus;2) [82]. Within the 
datasets, extraordinary high &ldquo;total biomass&rdquo; was also reported at 
the head of the Mississippi Submarine Canyon[35] due to dominance of a 
&ldquo;carpet of worms&rdquo;[83]. The observed biomass was still more than 
4-fold higher than our prediction. This is partially because the Gulf of Mexico 
basin had very high background bacterial biomass[52]. When the bacteria 
component is removed, the prediction still under estimates the observed biomass 
by about 50%. Hence, the total living carbon prediction in this study (Figure 7
) should be considered as a conservative estimate for the soft bottom 
communities solely reling on sinking phytodetritus, with the anomalies causing 
the observed biomass to deviate from this baseline (Figure 5b).</p> 
<h4>Predictor Importance</h4> 
<p>We tested the RF algorithm using only the primary productivity predictors 
(decadal mean and S.D. of chl, sst, par, bbp, mld, growth, carbon, vgpm, and 
cbpm) and depth (Table 1). We found that the reduced models only experienced 
modest deterioration in performance (R2reduced = 75%&ndash;80.3% for biomass of 
3 small size classes and R2reduced = 63% for megafauna biomass; R2reduced = 
76.3%&ndash;80.6% for abundance of 4 major size classes), suggesting that these 
productivity/depth predictors alone can explain much of the observed stock 
variances. It is also evident that these satellite-based ocean color parameters 
and depth are among the most important predictors when the full RF models were 
constructed (Figure 6). Their importance was even greater than the model 
estimates of export phytodetritus flux (det.c.flx &amp; det.n.flx,Table 1) that 
have been considered important for benthic communities[43], [56], [84], [85]. 
One possibility is that not all export flux is utilized by the benthos[35] and 
the combination of productivity/depth predictors simply explain the stock 
variances better; however, the spurious correlations between these predictors 
could also make them all rank highly important. Strobl et al.[86] recommended 
&ldquo;Conditional Permutation&rdquo; while calculating the variable importance 
to reduce the effect of spurious correlations. We did not attempt this analysis 
because our focus was on prediction rather than pinpointing the exact 
contribution of each predictor.</p> 
<h4>Conclusions</h4> 
<p>The fate of sinking phytodetritus flux to the ocean floor and the energy 
transfer to the benthos is a complex biogeochemical process. The combination of 
mechanistic primary productivity models[23], [24] and empirical relationship of 
export POC flux at depth[87] may not properly reflect the actual benthic food 
influx and consumption. In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of 
multivariate predictors and machine-learning algorithm was superior to 
conventional regression models using only water depth or export POC flux to 
predict benthic standing stocks[8], [88]. Conceptually, the RF predicted 
biomass presented here (Figure 7) can be seen as non-linear transformation of 
the surface primary production through a sophisticated decision network and is 
thus potentially a more realistic reflection of benthic food supply or 
utilization. Benthic biomass is essential to understand the dynamic processes 
of global carbon cycling[89] and productivity-diversity relationship in the 
deep sea[1], [2]. Predictive mapping of this kind can fill the gaps where 
critical biomass information is lacking, since a true &lsquo;census&rsquo; of 
global living carbon is expensive and practically impossible. Accurate 
prediction of benthic biomass can facilitate Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) 
on socioeconomically important species[90]. It is also extremely useful for 
generating and testing large scale hypotheses (e.g. latitudinal and cross-basin 
comparison) and planning shipboard surveys. Moreover, the reduced RF models 
mentioned above can be used to perform fine-scale predictions with high 
resolution ocean color images (5 arc minute grids) and the global relief model 
(1 arc minute grids,Table 1), and potentially reveal more heterogeneous biomass 
patterns at local scale than the current coarse analysis framework. The ocean 
color/depth predictors also make it possible to do contemporaneous modeling 
with recent sampling (SeaWiFS data are only available since 1997) or data 
collected in the future. This study presents an initial framework for archiving 
the seafloor standing stock data. More training datasets from diverse 
environments matched in space and time are urgently needed to improve the model 
performance and prediction accuracy, and perhaps, in due course, the seafloor 
standing stocks can be now-casted using the current ocean climate or even 
forecasted under the future climate scenarios[91].</p>
