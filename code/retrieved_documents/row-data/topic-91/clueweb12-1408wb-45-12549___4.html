 Model Selection </h1> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> The question that obviously now comes to mind is which model builder do we 
use. That is a question that has challenged us for a long time, and still there 
remains no definitive answer. It all depends on how well the model builder 
works on your data, and, in fact, how you measure the performance on the model. 
We review some of the insights that might help us choice the right model 
builder and, indeed, the right model, for our task.</p> 
<p> Contrary to expectations, there are few comprehensive comparative studies 
of the performance of various model builders. A notable exception is the study 
by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, who compared most modern model builders across 
numerous datasets using a variety of performance measures. The key conclusion, 
they found, was that boosted trees and random forests generally perform the 
best, and that decision trees, logistic regression and boosted stumps generally 
perform the worst. Perhaps more importantly though, it often depends on what is 
being measured as the performance criteria, and on the characteristics of the 
data being modelled.</p> 
<p> An overall conclusion from such comparative studies, then, is that often 
it is best to deploy different model builders over the dataset to investigate 
which performs the best. This is better than a single shot at the bullseye. We 
also need to be sure to select the appropriate criteria for evaluating the 
performance. The criteria should match the task at hand. For example, if the 
task is one of information retrieval then a Precision/Recall measure may be 
best. If the task is in the area of health, then the area under the ROC curve 
is an often used measure. For marketing, perhaps it is lift. For risk 
assessment, the Risk Charts are a good measure.</p> 
<p> So, in conclusion, it is good to build multiple models using multiple 
model builders. The tricky bits are tuning the model builders (requiring an 
understanding of the sometimes very many and very complex model builder 
parameters) and selecting the right criteria to assess the performance of the 
model (a criteria to match the task at hand--noting that raw accuracy is not 
always, and maybe not often, the right criteria).</p>
