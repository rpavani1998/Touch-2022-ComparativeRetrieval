</strong> <strong>(2010)</strong> <br>
Whelan, Thomas; Bergin, Susan; Power, 
James F. <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
The ACM curriculum defines 
Discrete Structures as foundational material for computer science; material 
that the ability to work with is necessary for many other areas of computer 
science. However a significant amount of uncertainty remains on how exactly to 
teach the subject to computer science undergraduates in a tangible way. This 
technical report presents a systematic literature review of the literature 
relevant to the teaching of discrete structures and evaluates the findings of 
the process. A categorisation of the results is described followed by an 
analysis of each category. <br>

<strong>Computer Graphical 
Interfaces, Reflection and the Teaching and Learning of Music Composition - a 
Holistic Study.</strong> <strong>(2006)</strong> <br>
JENNINGS, KEVIN GERARD 
<br> <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
This thesis is a holistic study in the 
area of teaching and learning of music composition for children in the age 
range eight to eleven years. It investigates the role of graphical computer 
technology within the framework of a reflection-in-action model for teaching, 
learning and research. Its primary aims are firstly: to examine if 
reflection-in-action provides a valid model for description of the behaviour 
and interactions of teachers, learners and researchers in a technology-enabled 
environment, and secondly; to investigate how technology enables/facilitates 
this model in the case of each. This is done through both examination of both 
childrens and teachers behaviours, processes and strategies as they work 
together with graphical music software, and also by analysis of childrens 
compositional products. Two pieces of software were developed, one designed 
solely by the author (DrumSteps), the other in collaboration with research 
students at MIT (Hyperscore). Each piece of softwar... <br>

In this paper we present an overview of the use of 
Problem Based Learning (PBL) in a first year Computer Science programming 
module.PBL was not employed in any of the programmong modules within the 
Department of Computer Science and assessment and learning for this module was 
on an individual student basis. We outline the problems that we encountered 
with our previous approach for teaching this module and our rationale for 
enhancing our approach through PBL. <br>

Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-2001-29<br>
The computer games industry is now 
bigger than the film industry. Until recently, technology in games was driven 
by a desire to achieve real-time, photo-realistic graphics. To a large extent, 
this has now been achieved. As game developers look for new and innovative 
technologies to drive games development, AI is coming to the fore. This paper 
will examine how sophisticated AI techniques, such as those being used in 
mainstream academic research, can be applied to computer games and introduce 
three projects doing just that. <br>

<strong>
Overview of Appearance Based Methods in Computer Vision</strong> <strong>(1999)
</strong> <br>
Duffy, Nicola <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-1999-51
<br>Appearance based methods turned traditional computer vision approaches to 
object recognition upside down. Instead of going from image to 3D model and 
matching that model to models of know objects, appearance based methods stay in 
the 2D image domain. Objects are modelled based on how they can appear in 
images, and this is learned directly from images; it is not necessary to have 
any explicit knowledge of the shape or re ectance properties of the object. 
This technical report presents an overview of appearance based methods in 
computer vision. <br>

Case-Based Plan Recognition in Computer Games</strong> <strong>(2003)</strong>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
<br> TCD-CS-2003-01<br>
In this paper we explore the use of case-based plan 
recognition to predict a player&rsquo;s actions in a computer game. The game we 
work with is the classic Space Invaders game and we show that case-based plan 
recognition can produce good prediction accuracy in real-time, working with a 
fairly simple game representation. Our evaluation suggests that a personalized 
plan library will produce better prediction accuracy but, for Space Invaders, 
good accuracy can be produced using a plan library derived from the game play 
of another player. <br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
Purpose: Public health 
research requires data-intense studies over extended periods. With the advent 
of new technologies, there has been a resulting explosion in the amount of data 
generated by wearable sensors that can be used in physical activity research. 
Unfortunately the advances in hardware (e.g. device size), have not been 
matched by software to help manage, organise and analyse this data deluge. 
Public health research will require cross-disciplinary interactions with the 
computer science community in working towards solutions to automatically 
recognise human activities from wearable sensor data. Methods: We conducted a 
meta-review of contemporary computing science and information retrieval 
approaches such as: 1) the management and indexing of data from wearable 
accelerometer and image capturing devices; 2) the synchronisation and fusion of 
data from multiple devices (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, &amp; SenseCam data); and 
3) the representation of the meaning of image data Res... <br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-2000-25
<br>This paper describes the development of a networked music application at 
Trinity College Dublin. Smart Radio is a web based client-server application 
which uses streaming audio technology and collaborative recommendation 
techniques to allow users build, manage and share music programmes. While it is 
generally acknowledged that music distribution over the web will dramatically 
change how the music industry operates, there are few prototypes available to 
demonstrate how this could work in an managed way. The Smart Radio approach is 
to have people manage their music resources by putting together personalised 
music programmes. These programmes can then be swapped using techniques of 
collaborative recommendation to find similarities between users. The smart 
radio system currently runs within the Computer Science Intranet with 
permission from the Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO). It is a prototype 
system for an &quot;always on&quot; high bandwidth Internet connect... <br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong>

[Introduction] In September 1996, Broadcom Ireland 
formed a research collaboration with the Computer Science Department in Trinity 
College Dublin., in order to explore current research in the domain of 
Intelligent Agents and to apply this technology to applications in 
communications. The resulting collaboration has been named the Intelligent 
Agents Group (IAG), consisting of four members from TCD working in liaison with 
a group of similar size from Broadcom. Intelligent Agents are one of the 
&quot;hot&quot; topics in Information Systems R&amp;D at the moment. The last 
ten years have seen a marked interest in agent-oriented technology, spanning 
applications as diverse as information retrieval, user interface design and 
network management. This diversity means that the IA field presents a very 
confusing picture. The main goal of this IAG review is to report on research in 
the rapidly evolving area of software agents and to highlight the applicability 
of this technol... <br>

While it is universally held by computer 
scientists that conference publications have a higher status in computer

promotion makes this a big issue since an exclusive focus on journal papers 
will miss many significant papers published at conferences in computer science. 
In this paper we set out to quantify the relative importance of journal and

leading conferences match the impact of papers in mid-ranking journals and 
surpass the impact of papers in journals in the bottom half of the ISI rankings

<strong>Where do &quot;Soccer Moms&quot; 
Come From? : Cognitive Constraints on Noun-Noun Compounding in English</strong> 
<strong>(1996)</strong> <br>
Keane, Mark T.; Costello, Fintan <br>
<strong>
Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-96-18<br>
Every year new noun-noun combinations 
enter the English language and become common parlance; compounds like 
&quot;notebook computer&quot; and &quot;soccer mom&quot;. But, why is one pair 
of words chosen rather than another pair ? For example,why do we not use 
&quot;patio-tile computer&quot; and &quot;sports mother&quot; ? Clearly, many 
factors influence the process. We concentrate on the cognitive factor of 
informativeness; namely, that a novel combination should convey its meaning 
unambiguously. Costello &amp; Keane (1996) have shown that some classes of 
concept promote ambiguity (or polysemy) in novel nounnoun compounds; artifact 
and superordinate terms promote polysemy whereas natural-kind and basic-level 
terms do not. Here we show that the topology of these conceptual classes in a 
large corpus of familiar compounds indicates that they constrain the compounds 
that appear in a language. <br>

<strong>Topographic Object Recognition Through Shape</strong> <strong>(2001)
</strong> <br>
Keyes, Laura; Winstanley, Adam C. <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
<br> Automatic structuring (feature coding and object recognition) of 
topographic data, such as that derived from air survey or raster scanning 
large-scale paper maps, requires the classification of objects such as 
buildings, roads, rivers, fields and railways. The recognition of objects in 
computer vision is largely based on the matching of descriptions of shapes. 
Fourier descriptors, moment invariants, boundary chain coding and scalar 
descriptors are methods that have been widely used and have been developed to 
describe shape irrespective of position, orientation and scale. The 
applicability of the above four methods to topographic shapes is described and 
their usefulness evaluated. All methods derive descriptors consisting of a 
small number of real values from the object's polygonal boundary. Two large 
corpora representing data sets from Ordnance Survey maps of Purbeck and 
Plymouth were available. The effectiveness of each description technique was 
evaluated by using one corpus ... <br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>

TCD-CS-1999-07<br>
We are currently witnessing a convergence of several threads 
of technology and business imperatives. The idea of a virtual enterprise (VE) 
&ndash; a business built from both organizationally and geographically 
distributed units &ndash; is becoming an area of increasing interest to both 
computer scientists and business people. The Objects, Components and the 
Virtual Enterprise workshop at OOPSLA 98 investigated the role of 
Object/Component analysis, design and programming in the realization of the VE. 
The workshop addressed topics including lifecycle models, case studies, HCI, 
object renaming, and software architectures VEs. <br>

<strong>B&eacute;zier Curves for Camera Motion</strong> <strong>(1994)</strong> 
<br> Buckley, Colm <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-94-18<br>
This 
paper describes an attempt to address some of the deficiencies and infelicities 
associated with the use of piecewise B&eacute;zier segments when constructing a 
smooth path for a camera in a computer animation. In particular, techniques are 
presented for rotational interpolation, ensuring continuity where the time 
intervals between key-frames are variable and generating curve segments with 
higher-order continuity, for example, acceleration continuity. <br>

<strong>Abstract:

TCD-CS-2004-43<br>
This paper is a description of our work in 
creating a story director agent which utilises AI techniques. The story 
director controls the storyline in an adventure computer game, with the player 
controlling the hero character, and the story director reacting to the player's 
actions. The story is told through subplot-level plans being formulated with a 
case-based planner, and a social simulation system that the story director is 
'plugged in to', allowing consistent logical stories while allowing for player 
freedom. The system has been named OPIATE &ndash; Open-ended Proppian 
Interactive Adaptive Tale Engine. <br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-2001-20
<br>In the past, games development has been driven by the need to achieve more 
realistic graphics. This has resulted in a situation today with games set in 
visually stunning, and almost photo realistic worlds being the norm. As game 
developers seek something new to make their games stand out from the rest, 
artificial intelligence is playing a far more important role in game design 
than before. The most obvious application of AI to games is in creating Non 
Player Characters (NPCs). Although visually stunning worlds have been created 
for computer games, the NPCs inhabiting these worlds are most often shallow and 
uninteresting. This paper will introduce the idea of Proactive Persistent NPCs, 
that is NPCs that are always modelled (at least to some extent) even when the 
human player is not in their vicinity. We will consider the issues involved in 
creating these persistent characters, and propose an intelligent agent 
architecture which will allow the creation of realistic,... <br>

It is often necessary to be able to create 
computer models from physical objects. This is often done for the purposes of 
reverse engineering, or archival. Many of the contact methods, such as 
callipers or Coordinate Measuring Machines, are unsuitable for use in areas 
where the material is delicate. There are numerous techniques that are capable 
of performing quick accurate measurements of surface geometry, a number of 
which are reviewed. <br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-95-16<br>
As a 
research topic computer game playing has contributed problems to AI that 
manifest exponential growth in the problem space. For the most part, in games 
such as chess and checkers these problems have been surmounted with enormous 
computing power on brute-force search methods using massive databases. It 
remains to be seen whether such techniques will extend to other games such as 
go and shogi. One suggestion is that these games and even chess might benefit 
from a knowledge-based treatment but such approaches have met with limited 
success. The problem, as ever from such approaches, is the characterisation of 
the knowledge to be used by the system. This paper deals with the Tal system, 
which employs case-based reasoning techniques for chess playing. In the paper, 
rather than focus on playing, we concentrate on the automatic generation of 
suitable case knowledge using a chunking technique on a corpus of grandmaster 
games. <br>

Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-93-25<br>
The psychological investigation of 
complex analogies (like the solar system / atom analogy) began in the late 
1970s and in the intervening period has grown into a prototypical, area of 
Cognitive Science research. During this time the investigation of complex 
analogies have gone from rough general notions to detailed computational 
models. This paper traces the theoretical and empirical development in the area 
and plots the major advances which have occurred. Apart from reviewing the 
literature, the main aim of the paper is to present this area as a template for 
the development of other Cognitive Science research topics. Thus, it should 
have important implications for the methodology of modern research in Cognitive 
Psychology. Finally, some outstanding problems in the area and likely 
directions for future research are considered. <br>

<strong>
Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-2006-25<br>
Inductive learning systems have been 
successfully applied in a number of medical domains. It is generally accepted 
that the highest accuracy results that an inductive learning system can achieve 
depend on the quality of data and on the appropriate selection of a learning 
algorithm for the data. In this paper we analyze the effect of class noise on 
supervised learning in medical domains. We review the related work on learning 
from noisy data and propose to use feature extraction as a pre-processing step 
to diminish the effect of class noise on the learning process. Our experiments 
with 8 medical datasets show that feature extraction indeed helps to deal with 
class noise. It clearly results in higher classification accuracy of learnt 
models without the separate explicit elimination of noisy instances. <br>

<strong>Abstract:

TCD-CS-2006-24<br>
Data mining (DM) and knowledge discovery are 
intelligent tools that help to accumulate and process data and make use of it. 
We review several existing frameworks for DM research that originate from 
different paradigms. These DM frameworks mainly address various DM algorithms 
for the different steps of the DM process. Recent research has shown that many 
real-world problems require integration of several DM algorithms from different 
paradigms in order to produce a better solution elevating the importance of 
practice-oriented aspects also in DM research. In this paper we strongly 
emphasize that DM research should also take into account the relevance of 
research, not only the rigor of it. Under relevance of research in general, we 
understand how good this research is in terms of the utility of its results. 
This chapter motivates development of such a new framework for DM research that 
would explicitly include the concept of relevance. We introduce the basic idea

<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>

TCD-CS-2006-23<br>
Random Forests are a successful ensemble prediction 
technique that combines two sources of randomness to generate base decision 
trees; bootstrapping instances for each tree and considering a random subset of 
features at each node. Breiman in his introductory paper on Random Forests 
claims that they are more robust than boosting with respect to overfitting 
noise, and are able to compete with boosting in terms of predictive 
performance. Multiple recently published empirical studies conducted in various 
application domains confirm these claims. Random Forests use simple majority 
voting to combine the predictions of the trees. However, it is clear that each 
decision tree in a random forest may have different contribution in classifying 
a certain instance. In this paper, we demonstrate that the prediction 
performance of Random Forests may still be improved in some domains by 
replacing the combination function. Dynamic integration, which is based on 
local performance es... <br>

<strong>Feature Extraction for Dynamic Integration of Classifiers</strong>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
<br> TCD-CS-2006-32<br>
Recent research has shown the integration of multiple 
classifiers to be one of the most important directions in machine learning and 
data mining. In this paper, we present an algorithm for the dynamic integration 
of classifiers in the space of extracted features (FEDIC). It is based on the 
technique of dynamic integration, in which local accuracy estimates are 
calculated for each base classifier of an ensemble, in the neighborhood of a 
new instance to be processed. Generally, the whole space of original features 
is used to find the neighborhood of a new instance for local accuracy estimates 
in dynamic integration. However, when dynamic integration takes place in high 
dimensions the search for the neighborhood of a new instance is problematic, 
since the majority of space is empty and neighbors can in fact be located far 
from each other. Furthermore, when noisy or irrelevant features are present it 
is likely that also irrelevant neighbors will be associated with a t... <br>

<strong>Context-Aware Aspects</strong> <strong>(2006)</strong> <br>

Bergel, Alexandre <br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
TCD-CS-2006-35<br>

Context-aware applications behave differently depending on the context in which 
they are running. Since context-specific behaviour tends to crosscut base 
programs, it can advantageously be implemented as aspects. This leads to the 
notion of context-aware aspects, i.e., aspects whose behaviour depends on 
context. This paper analyzes the issue of appropriate support from the aspect 
language to both restrict the scope of aspects according to the context and 
allow aspect definitions to access information associated to the context.We 
propose an open framework for context-aware aspects that allows for the 
definition of first-class contexts and supports the definition of context 
awareness constructs for aspects, including the ability to refer to past 
contexts, and to provide domainand application-specific constructs. <br>
