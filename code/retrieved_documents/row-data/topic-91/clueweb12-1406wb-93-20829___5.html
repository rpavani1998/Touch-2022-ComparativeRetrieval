<h2> Overview </h2> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> Boosting builds a collection of models using a ``weak learner'' and 
thereby reduces misclassification error, bias, and variance (, ,). Boosting has 
been implemented in, for example, Refer[c50]C5.0. The term originates with(). 
</p> 
<p> The algorithm is quite simple, beginning by building an initial model from 
the training dataset. Those entites in the training data which the model was 
unable to capture (i.e., the model mis-classifies those entites) have their 
weights boosted. A new model is then built with these boosted entities, which 
we might think of as the problematic entities in the training dataset. This 
model building followed by boosting is repeated until the specific generated 
model performs no better than random. The result is then a panel of models used 
to make a decision on new data by combining the ``expertise'' of each model in 
such a way that the more accurate experts carry more weight.</p> 
<p> As a meta learner Boosting employs some other simple learning algorithm to 
build the models. The key is the use of a weak learning algorithm--essentially 
any weak learner can be used. A weak learning algorithm is one that is only 
somewhat better than random guessing in terms of error rates (i.e., the error 
rate is just below 50%). An example might be decision trees of depth 1 (i.e., 
decision stumps).</p>
