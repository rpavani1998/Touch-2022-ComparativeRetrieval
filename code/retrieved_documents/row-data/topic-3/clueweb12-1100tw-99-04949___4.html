<p>Well its been a long time since we had a major Photoshop Release, but as of 
now one is on the horizon.</p> 
<p>Adobe Systems Incorporated has announced that Adobe Photoshop CS6 beta is 
available as a free download fromAdobe Labs. Customers can download the beta, 
try out the experience and provide feedback to the product team. Packed with 
groundbreaking new innovations,&nbsp;features&nbsp;and incredible performance 
enhancements, Photoshop CS6 beta is available for the Mac OS and Microsoft 
Windows platforms. The final release is expected in the first half of 2012.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Photoshop CS6 will be a milestone release that pushes the boundaries 
of imaging innovation with incredible speed and performance,&rdquo; said 
Winston Hendrickson, vice president products, Creative Media Solutions, Adobe. 
&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t wait to share this beta of Photoshop CS6 with our 
customers and are looking forward to hearing from them and seeing the ways they 
are incorporating the beta into their daily creative workflows.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>New Features in Photoshop CS6 Beta </strong></p> 
<p>Photoshop CS6 beta demonstrates Adobe&rsquo;s focus on huge performance 
enhancements, imaging magic and creativity tools that offer customers a new 
experience in digital imaging. Key features include new additions to the 
Content-Aware tools: Content-Aware Patch allows greater control by letting 
users select and duplicate an area of an image to fill in or 
&ldquo;patch&rdquo; another. Content-Aware Move lets users select and magically 
move an object to a new place in the image.</p> 
<p>Customers will experience incredible performance, powered by the new Adobe 
Mercury Graphics Engine, enabling near-instant results from popular editing 
tools including Liquify, Puppet Warp, Transform and Lighting Effects; and a 
refined, modern interface featuring dark UI options to make images pop. New and 
re-engineered design tools make creating designs faster and more efficient. 
Vector layers allow users to apply dashed lines and gradient strokes, 
searchable layers help quickly zero in on any layer you need, and new type 
styles let designers quickly apply type treatments to their designs.</p> 
<p>In addition, the Photoshop CS6 beta offers all the features of Adobe 
Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended, such as new 3D editing features 
and quantitative imaging analysis capabilities. These features will be included 
in the shipping version of Photoshop CS6 Extended when it becomes available.</p>
