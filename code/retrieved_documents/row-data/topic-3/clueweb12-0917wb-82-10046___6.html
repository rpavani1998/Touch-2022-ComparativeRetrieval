<p>I have used this camera for only a few days and am very satisfied and 
enthusiastic. Nikon has made an excellent product. You can change the 
camera&rsquo;s ISO very quickly and it goes up to 3200. Very useful.<br>
 There 
are many playback features such as zooming in close on an image and navigating 
around in it. It is a big improvement over previous models. The new playback 
screen is much bigger and has an awesome resolution. You can live preview on 
it. Very cool!There are several focus options, including the 51 point focus. 
You can press help on any menu item and it will explain what that item is 
clearly and easy to read.<br>
 The menu is easy to navigate and easy to use. 
The camera is comfortable to hold, has a solid feel and all of the controls are 
within easy reach. Shooting mode, ISO and most other controls can be easily 
changed without going into the menu. All the above are features, but the most 
important benefit is excellent and sharp images.</p>
