<h1> My Thoughts on D800/D800E Features</h1> 
<p>B&amp;H Photo has the Nikon D800 and D800E <strong>AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER
</strong>. Thank you for ordering through this site&rsquo;s links.</p> 
<p>Here I capture a few of my thoughts about the D800 / D800E feature set.</p> 
<p>I have a D800E and D800 coming. I am buying the D800E, getting a loaner 
D800. I will be comparing both, and the Nikon D4 also.</p> 
<h3>Overall</h3> 
<p>Nikon appears to have produced a HOME RUN, especially since Canon has 
nothing near it (yet). No doubt the D800 / D800E will have some disappointments 
and limitations, but it looks about as appealing to me as any Nikon DSLR yet.
</p> 
<p>Will it be as good in image quality as the Nikon D3x? Well, 2+ years of 
sensor technology development has to count for something. Possibly better, 
possibly not quite as good. But even it it were close to the D3x on a per-pixel 
basis, having 50% more pixels is an intriguing tradeoff for some shooting.</p> 
<p>Sampling the image at 36 megapixels opens up new horizons in photography, 
new creative possibilities, increased realism, the ability to crop, to 
downsample, etc. I&rsquo;ll suggest that 100-200 megapixels would be ideal for 
the sampling frequency of a DSLR, which might mean<em>finished</em> images in 
the 50-60 megapixel range. So we are not done yet.</p> 
<p> Let the megapixel haters stew in their own mental vomit.</p> 
<p>How will Canon respond? Will a Canon 5D Mark III appear with similar 
megapixels? Or will Canon claim the smaller-is-better approach? I predict that 
failure to match the D800 resolution will grow Nikon&rsquo;s market share 
substantially.</p> 
<p>Note that by going Nikon, one can buy Zeiss ZF.2 lenses, and these can ALSO 
be used on Canon with an adapter. The reverse is not possible.</p> 
<h3>&ldquo;But I only want 18MP JPEGs in sRGB&rdquo;</h3> 
<p>Easy: shoot in RAW, batch process to beautiful artifact-free 18MP JPEGs 
with proper white balance and sharpening and low compression, then toss the RAW 
files.<em>No big deal</em>. And a big deal: superior quality including the 
option to rescue an image or use a wide-gamut spacewhen sRGB or AdobeRGB would 
flatten the color response (increasingly common).</p> 
<h3>Vs the Nikon D4</h3> 
<p>For those who must have ultra low-light capability, the Nikon D800E + Nikon 
D4 seem to me to be a tantalizing combination.</p> 
<h3>Resolution </h3> 
<p>Based on Nikon&rsquo;s past history (e.g., D3x / D3s), and the Sony NEX-7 
image quality (even smaller photosites), I predict that the 2-3 years of sensor 
technology improvements are going to produce stunning image quality at ISO 100 
- 400, along with very good image quality thereafter. This is very exciting and 
useful, given the 36MP resolution.</p> 
<p>Setting aside the <em>cost</em> of the D800, it also means that a cropped 
sensor DX-format camera is pointless for the purposes of getting closer to a 
distant subject (e.g. wildlife), since the D800 can be cropped down to its DX 
area for 16MP images. Thus the D800 represents a best of all worlds scenario.
</p> 
<h3>LCD display</h3> 
<p>I am disappointed here. The 921K pixel screen is claimed to have some 
improvements in viewing quality, but I was hoping that the 36MP sensor would be 
matched by a 1.5 or 2+ million pixel LCD.</p> 
<p>I hope that the ambient light sensor for the LCD does not go haywire when 
using afocusing loupe.</p> 
<h3>Image quality</h3> 
<p>In terms of per-pixel quality, Nikon&rsquo;s discussion of 14-bit A/D 
conversion and a 16-bit internal processing pipeline is highly encouraging. 
Which suggests to me that with even halfway decent lighting and the very best 
lenses, we might be in for a jaw-dropping camera. And that with most lenses, 
the camera will be so good that only the failure to use a better lens will keep 
the photographer thinking that the optical quality is good. Eyes might be 
opened with the right proper select few lenses.</p> 
<h3>Lenses</h3> 
<p>I predict that most Nikon zooms and some primes will not be up to snuff 
over the whole frame, but will provide very acceptable results in the central 
1/2 to 2/3 area, which is where portraits and similar shots need the sharpness. 
I doubt very much that landscape and similar shots which require whole-frame 
sharpness will realize the potential of the D800 using most of the Nikon lens 
lineup, at least most of the zoom lineup. The D800 / D800E will even flush out 
the few weaker offerings in theZeiss lineup.</p> 
<p>One reader asked me if I would be reviewing the Nikon 28-300 zoom! It 
almost felt as if my 4 year old were asking me about Santa Claus or the Tooth 
Fairy. While zooms are much better than they were even 5 years ago, one&rsquo;s 
image quality standards have to be rock-bottom to posit that a 28-300 would be 
a good lens on a 36MP camera. I shot the 28-300 briefly on the 12MP Nikon D3s, 
and it was an underperformer there, and that&rsquo;s 12MP, not 36MP. Shoot a 
top-grade lens, and your expectations change, forever.</p> 
<h3>Face tracking</h3> 
<p>Face tracking might actually be useful. I don&rsquo;t like most silly new 
features, but I am going to keep an open mind on this one.</p> 
<h3>Improved metering</h3> 
<p>There is a first time for everything I suppose. Like clockwork, Nikon 
claims improved metering once again. Except that I resort to manual frequently 
with every past Nikon body, because the AF system is too unreliable for any of 
the interesting scenes that I shoot.</p> 
<h3>Autofocus accuracy</h3> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus. But I might take a 
fresh look if Nikon fixes theAF accuracy issues with my D3x and D3s with 
&AElig;&#146;/1.4 lenses.</p> 
<h3>Video</h3> 
<p>I keep thinking video might be useful for me. But I&rsquo;m intimidated by 
video. Really. It&rsquo;s a whole different art form. Still, the size and 
weight of the camera mean that it might yet prove to be the first video camera 
I really use. Of course I would use my Zeiss lenses, because Nikon AF lenses 
for manual focus are an exercise in frustration.</p> 
<p>Too bad the D800 cannot shoot 4K video.</p> 
<h3>Live View</h3> 
<p>I do hope that Nikon has fixed the white-out bug in the D3x and the 
bang-bang mirror slap problem and has implemented Canon-style &ldquo;Mode 
2&rdquo; exposure, and also has not gone and introduced some fundamental flaw.
</p> 
<h3>Self timer</h3> 
<p>Is it too much to hope that self timer mode could be set to mirror up 
immediately, so that image quality is not destroyed by vibration when using the 
self timer with an unstable setup or long lens?</p> 
<h3>Long exposures</h3> 
<p>Being able to set an exposure longer than 30 seconds without resorting to a 
programmable remote release. At least let us have 1/2/4/8 minutes Nikon. Please.
</p> 
<h3>USB 3.0</h3> 
<p>Useless for Mac users as yet. But what could Nikon do.</p> 
<h3>Card slots</h3> 
<p>I thought were were finally done with the dual card slots taking 
incompatible cards. I suppose one can just ignore one of the slots. But now if 
you also carry a Nikon D4, that high speed XQD card is useless in a D800/D800E, 
leading to one more planning complication for those of us carrying a system 
with both cameras.</p> 
<h3>Dual-axis level</h3> 
<p>Somewhat useful yes. Accurate, probably not. The existing virtual horizon 
feature on the D3x / D3s is not accurate to more than ~1&deg;, so buildings 
visibly tilt, something I&rsquo;ve seen over and over with my Nikon pro bodies.
