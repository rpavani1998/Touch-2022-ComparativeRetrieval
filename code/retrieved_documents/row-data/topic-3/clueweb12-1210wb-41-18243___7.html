<h1>The Complete Rogue Flash Benders Review</h1> 
<p>by Chris Gampat on April 20, 2011</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>So are the ExpoImaging Rogue Flash Benders the best flash modifiers ever? 
Many photographers would say so, and to be quite honest I couldn&rsquo;t find a 
single fault with them. Bendable, pliable, shapable, versatile: theRogue Flash 
Benders let you really harness the light output from your flash and give the 
strobist some of the best control I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Let&rsquo;s review what 
we&rsquo;ve done.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Complete Postings</h2> 
<p>Day 1- Small overview of the Flash Benders as well as some results from 
using them at an event.</p> 
<p>Day 2- Shot an event at the B&amp;H Event Space with them.</p> 
<p>Day 3- Used at an event during the Canon T3i review.</p> 
<h2>Ease of Use</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Flash Benders come in three sizes: large, small, and bounce card. By 
far, my favorite is the large because of the softer light it gives off combined 
with its versatility and overall coverage it provides. The larger unit it also 
the easiest to use because it can easily be formed into different 
configurations like a snoot, arch, wide angular spread, etc.</p> 
<p>The small card and bounce card aren&rsquo;t as useful. I&rsquo;d recommend 
using the small card specifically for when you need wider coverage from your 
flash or when you&rsquo;re doing product photos. As for the bounce card, well, 
it did serve the purpose and was still the most versatile bounce card out 
there. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, for what it does, it&rsquo;s great. However, 
once you use thelarge Flash Bender you will be spoiled.</p> 
<h2>Ergonomics</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Flash Benders are all able to fit into nearly any pocket of your camera 
bag. Then can be folded, then folded again and sometimes even again. When 
you&rsquo;re ready to use them, you can whip them out and get right to work 
after bending them back into shape.</p> 
<p>Think of them as transformers.</p> 
<p>Additionally, the belt at the bottom of each is totally adjustable to fit 
around various sized flashes. You can tell that someone really put thought into 
these when they designed them, yet they are so extremely simple in design.</p> 
<h2>Flash Output</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The flash output from your flash and the way that the Rogue Flash Benders 
affect them are different for each configuration. However, I didn&rsquo;t 
really see any light loss at all in my usage.</p> 
<p>Typically with flash modifiers, I&rsquo;m either switching to total manual 
control or flash exposure compensation when using them in E-TTL. I never had to 
do that once with these.</p> 
<h2>Versatility</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I can really go on and on about the versatility of these items. But here is 
how they can be used by you:</p> 
<p>Event Photographers: You can use them as bounce cards to provide more 
indirect light onto people or a crowd.</p> 
<p>Wedding Photographers: The Flash Benders will allow you to aim your 
flash&rsquo;s output more efficiently, which is so critical at weddings. 
Consider these during the reception when everyone is on the dance floor. Have 
the Flash Benders reflect light onto the subjects and ensure that the flash is 
still pointed towards the ceiling. You&rsquo;ll be able to provide better 
balance that way if you balance the shutter speed, apertures and ISOs.</p> 
<p>Portrait Photographers: As a snoot, they can be great hair lights. They 
also can provide a lot of contrasty lighting when used correctly. You 
won&rsquo;t get the wrap-around quality of an umbrella, but you&rsquo;ll get 
something in between an umbrella and a softbox.</p> 
<p>Landscape Photographers: Forget it.</p> 
<p>Photojournalists: See portrait and wedding photographers.</p> 
<p>Product Photographers: These are best used with your strobes being set off 
wirelessly. They can provide very flash and even lighting as well as spotlights 
as being snoots.</p> 
<p>Street Photographers: If you use flash on your street photography, I would 
actually ensure that these are always angled downward towards your subjects to 
give them full frontal illumination in order to balance out their exposure with 
the ambient lighting.</p> 
<h2>Conclusions</h2> 
<p>When they were released, they were the hype of the blogosphere. Rightfully 
so, theFlash Benders are the only flash modifers that I cannot find fault with. 
Indeed, they&rsquo;ve become my new go to item for nearly any occasion.</p> 
<p>Just pick the one that&rsquo;s best for you.</p>
