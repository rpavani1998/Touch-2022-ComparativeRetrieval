<h1>Lens Therapy: Nikon DX Lenses Under $300</h1> 
<p>by Gevon Servo on August 25, 2011</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>A lot of Nikon photographers think they need to spend thousands, on lenses, 
to take great photos. They read all the information available and think they 
know the best of the best. However, they cannot always afford these lenses. 
Some even let this hold them back. They can though,save money or think 
differently, especially if they are Nikon DX(D7000 , D3100, D300s) 
&nbsp;shooters. There are lenses available, under $300 USD respectively. These 
lenses will allow them to shoot moststyles of photography, and do it well. 
It&rsquo;s not always the gear, its person behind it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Update:No Wide angle Lenses?</h2> 
<p>At this price point there are no wide angle lenses beyond the 35mm and the 
<strong><strong>Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR </strong></strong>
which was reviewed with the D3100<strong><strong> .</strong></strong>Because 
its a common &lsquo;kit&rsquo; lens i did not include it.<strong><strong> The 
18-55 is available on its own, though, for around $150<br>
</strong></strong>

<h2>Nikon AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G</h2> 
<p>Shot with Nikon AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G</p> 
<p>This is the first lens I purchased, outside of my kit lens. The Nikon AF-S 
DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8Gis 11.8g ,properly quick, prime, and a &nbsp;good size. In 
essence, it is a thing of beauty. The 35mm 1.8 is a practical lens, if you so 
choose, you could use every day. The images are sharp and the lens is always 
consistent, from landscape to food photography. Released in March 2009 this 
lens is light, weighing 7.2 oz. The Nikon 35mm f1.8 focuses precisely and is 
uncannily fast. Rear-focusing elements allow for a non-rotating lens front, 
enabling easier usage of rotating filters such as circular polarizers. If I 
could do it all over again, I would have bought my Nikon, body only, and the 
Nikon 35mm f1.8 G. It is a great learning lens as well as a great lens for 
seasoned photographers. The price point has been around $200 USD lately.</p>

<h2>Nikon AF Nikkor 50 mm f/1.8D</h2> 
<p>Shot with Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.8D</p> 
<p>When was the last time, you just woke up just to go for a photo walk, at 
five in the morning, just to think to work stuff out? That is just one of the 
things I like to do with theNikon AF Nikkor 50 mm f/1.8D. Introduced in 2002 
this lens is the older cousin of the 35mm f1.8G. The 50mm f1.8D is an FX lens 
also. On a DX camera like the D7000 or my D90, the 50mm is a 75 mm equivalent. 
This makes it and excellent portrait lens. Even though the lens is not the 
newest one on the block, it is tack sharp and flexible. Its size makes it 
excellent for photo walking, but it also excels many styles of photography. I 
really like using this lens for low light photography. Every Nikon Photographer 
should have this lens. This lens can also be used with theBokeh Masters Kit. If 
you want to move to a FX (full frame) Nikon camera, this lens will make the 
jump with you. If you have a camera D40 or D60 this lens will not Auto Focus. 
Nikon has a remedy for that, The Nikon 50mm f1.8G. I have not tested this lens 
yet but as the successor to the 50mm f1.8D I am sure it measures up. The Nikon 
50mm 1.8D will cost around $125 USD and the newer G will cost you $199 USD</p>

<h2>Nikon AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 55-200mm f/4-5.6G</h2> 
<p>Shot with Nikon AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 55-200mm f/4-5.6G</p> 
<p>You cannot reach everything, with a 35mm and a 50mm sometimes, you need a 
zoom. That is where the Nikon AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor 55-200mm f/4-5.6G comes in, 
especially if you are on a budget. Released in 2007, it is great with every DX 
camera. It is not super-fast f2.8, but for the price, it performs very well. 
This lens is dignified and composed. It zooms nicely and is properly sharp. The 
VR works well, handheld, even in low-lit situations. The lens gives you three 
stops to work with, enabling hard to get shots, even when zoomed all the way 
out. This lens has a nice size and weighs about 12oz. The Nikon 50-200 VR will 
not take up a lot of room in your bag also. You can take this lens on a trip 
and not worry too much about it. This lens with cost around $150 USD</p>

<h2>Nikon AF-S DX Micro-NIKKOR 40mm f/2.8G</h2>

<p>Nikon recently announced a reasonably priced macro lens for DX cameras. I 
have not had a chance to test it yet, but it is impressive on paper. The 
lightweight lens offers a 1:1 macro image. It uses a silent wave motor like the 
other G Lenses. The Nikon AF-S DX Micro-NIKKOR 40mm f/2.8Gwill autofocus on all 
Nikon DSLRs and has a focus distance of around 6.4 Inches/ 16cm. As with the 
other lenses on in this post, this lenses can be carried anywhere. From 
Nikon&rsquo;s samples, it seems, it has great versatility also. This lens will 
cost around $280 USD and we will review it here as soon as we can.</p>

<p>There are none at this price point.</p> </li>

<p>At this price point you only have the Kit Lens to deal with, which is not 
bad in most cases</p> </li> </ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see this article in the same website that 
published this:<br>

http://www.thephoblographer.com/2011/02/26/why-lower-end-zoom-lenses-make-great-doorstops/
<br> IMHO, his facts are accurate but his conclusions are wrong.</p> 
<p>Cheap zooms and primes are great for hobbyists and enthusiasts and produce 
excellent results that were unimaginable a few years ago. Just because X is 
better, doesn&rsquo;t mean that Y is bad.</p> </li>

<p>This site is made up of more than one person, and we have different 
opinions and views. All, but 1,&nbsp; of the lenses I wrote about , Ive used 
.&nbsp; So wrote this article from my point of view. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>I was actually agreeing with you and disagreeing with Chris Grampat.</p> 
</li> </ul> 
<li> Chris Gampat <br>

<p>My last name is Gampat.</p> 
<p>Also, I say nothing bad about cheap primes. Have you not seen our list of 
best budget lenses? It&rsquo;s all primes.</p> 
<p>Cheap zooms, and I will firmly stand by this, cannot give you image quality 
in comparison to a prime of the same monetary value. It&rsquo;s just not going 
to happen.</p> 
<p>Are they good enough? I still wouldn&rsquo;t even say so. Zoom lenses will 
become soft after the typical bumps and knocks from the average consumer. Those 
will in turn knock lens elements around and make it soft. Zooms also 
can&rsquo;t be AF Fine Tuned or Micro Adjusted unless you do it for every focal 
length.</p> 
<p>So once again, those zooms aren&rsquo;t worth it and the image quality once 
again cannot take full advantage of the sensor&rsquo;s capability. So people 
instead just go buy a new camera vs getting newer and better lenses.</p> </li>

<p>I bought the 70-200mm f/2.8 VR lens seven years ago for $1400 new. &nbsp;I 
have never looked back. &nbsp;The quality of images blows away the consumer 
lenses. &nbsp;I also own a 55-200mm &nbsp;and 70-300mm VR. &nbsp;I could sell 
the 70-200mm VR today for $1500. &nbsp;Glass matters and is affordable.</p>
