<h1>Battle of the 85mm Lenses: Canon 85mm f1.8 vs Nikon 85mm f1.8</h1> 
<p>by Chris Gampat on March 25, 2012</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I was recently able to test fire and show a couple of sample images with 
the new Nikon 85mm f1.8 on my D5100, however I also was able to get my hands on 
a D700. Being a Canon 5D Mk II and 85mm f1.8 USM owner, I decided to put the 
two lenses in a non-scientific and totally practical test using all available 
light at around 7pm in NYC and only shooting at f4 and wider for a portrait.</p>
<p>So how did the two lenses perform?</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Gear Used</h2> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Ergonomics</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Both 85mm f1.8 lenses are very similar. The new Nikon 85mm f1.8 is far 
newer than the Canon version: which actually dates back to the film days. 
Nikon&rsquo;s front filter thread is just a bit larger than Canon&rsquo;s and 
the overall feel of the lens is a bit less plasticy. However, I&rsquo;ve always 
generally felt that Nikon gear feels more rugged; but that&rsquo;s just my 
personal opinion.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, both lens focusing rings feel identical.</p> 
<p>Both lenses focus extremely fast, though in real life practice I felt that 
Canon&rsquo;s 85mm f1.8 is still the current champ. Indeed, it has often been 
touted as the company&rsquo;s fastest focusing lens. A known problem with it 
though is the color fringing wide open; but this is also a problem that 
plague&rsquo;s Nikon&rsquo;s optics as shown in theprevious test.</p> 
<p>At this point though, I&rsquo;d like to remind all the forum readers and 
people that like to generally sit there and bitch about minor problems like 
this that those issues are generally easily fixed in post-production software. 
Still though, I&rsquo;d be doing an injustice if I didn&rsquo;t report on it.
</p> 
<h2>Process of the Test</h2> 
<p>I tried to shoot this test during the golden hour. Most of New York City is 
covered in buildings, and therefore needed to shoot at ISO 800 because of the 
diffused shadow lighting around the area.</p> 
<p>I set both cameras to aperture priority and focused on the same spot of 
Dennis&rsquo;s eye. Though their meter readings were very slightly off in 
aperture priority, it should be noted that in general, Canon and Nikon do have 
slightly different metering algorithms and this is just part of how they work.
</p> 
<p>Typically portraits like this are shot anywhere from wide open to f5.6. I 
stopped at f4 for this test.</p> 
<p>The images were then brought into Lightroom 4 Beta and had the clarity and 
sharpness adjusted the exact same amount for each image. In the export process, 
they were resized to 1.5MB on export and 300DPI.</p>

<p>I like the Nikon-shots the best, but why are the Canon pics so dark? </p> 
<p>Is everything else equal or did the cameras also add to the differences?</p>
</li> 
<ul>

<p>I noticed that when I brought them into Lightroom. Could I have made the 
exposures the same? Absolutely. But in general, Canon tends to underexpose at a 
given exposure level. Nikon&rsquo;s metering is better. For this reason when 
I&rsquo;m using my Nikon cameras, I always usually set the camera to be -1/3 
and Canon I overexpose by around 2/3 of a stop.</p> 
<p>But in this test, I let the cameras do all the work at Aperture priority to 
simulate their metering methods in real life as well. The Canon images may be 
darker and therefore also have a perceived better sharpness, but it&rsquo;s not 
really true.</p> </li> </ul> 
<li> Herr_Synnberg <br>

<p>The Nikon has much more pleasing bokeh. The Canon ones are pretty alright 
on their own, but seen alongside the Nikon, they just look way harsher. The 
non-round bokeh balls once stopped down doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> ChrisGampat <br>

<p>Agreed</p> </li> 
<li> Das <br>

<p>Completely disagree. The Canon has better (sonnar-like) bokeh. But the 
Nikon seems to be much sharper &mdash; looks like the Canon is not properly 
focused or needs a micro-focus adjustment).</p> </li> </ul> 
<li> Engels-foto <br>

<p>The Canon Pics have &nbsp;more sky in the background,&nbsp;for this reason 
the comparison is difficult and not fair.</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> ChrisGampat <br>

<p>How? What&rsquo;s important is the subject matter in focus?</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> Engels-foto <br>

<p>I think the pictures of Canon for this reason are darker.<br>
 The light 
sky works like back light and affects themselves naturally negatively.<br>
 The 
Nikon pictures works more brilianter because no back light effect.<br>
 for 
this reason I think the comparison is difficult and not fair.</p> </li> </ul> 
</ul> 
<li> SpoorthyVemula <br>

<p>I am fansinated by how still the guy is in both sets of pics</p> </li> 
<li> Theresa Z <br>

<p>I also noticed that the Canon shots were darker but assumed you had taken 
them after the Nikon shots and it may have been getting darker out. I was 
looking more for clarity at the f stop you had it on.</p> 
<p>Also, I was wondering if you did a test with these on manual for those who 
only shoot on M.</p> 
<p>Thanks, great article. This lens for Canon is on my list.</p> </li> </ul>
