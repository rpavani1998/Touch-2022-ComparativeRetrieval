<p>Apparently the newly announced C500 may go for around $30,000.</p> 
<p>Straight from the press release:</p> 
<p>&rdquo; <em>Further details regarding the Cinema EOS C500/C500 PL digital 
cinematography cameras &ndash; including specifications and pricing &ndash; 
have yet to be decided, although preliminary plans are for a suggested list 
price of approximately $30,000&dagger;. Plans also call for these new products 
to be launched later this year. In addition to targeting a swift launch of 
these cameras, Canon will continue to enhance other components of its Cinema 
EOS System product lineup, which is designed to contribute to the continued 
advancement of tools for visual expression and the development of cinematic 
culture.</em>&rdquo;</p>
