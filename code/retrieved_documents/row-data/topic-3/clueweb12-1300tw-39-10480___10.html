<h1>Fujifilm X S1 vs. Canon SX40 HS vs. Nikon P500</h1> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

26X optical Zoom Lens on the other hand Canon SX 40 HS comes half price and 
features 35X optical Zoom, which camera you will buy and why? Read the&nbsp; 
Specification Comparison review of Fujifilm X S1 with Canon SX40 HS and Nikon 
P500 and share your thoughts with us.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy Fujifilm X S1 from Amazon || Amazon UK</strong><br>
<strong>Buy 
Canon SX 40 HS fromAmazon || Amazon UK || Adorama || B&amp;H</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>About Sensor and processor</strong></p> 
<p>Fujifilm X S1 features bigger sensor compared to Canon SX 40HS and Nikon 
P500, The sensor is not only bigger but Fuji X S1 uses same sensor of Fuji X 10 
(Pro compact camera) and in several test done by Fujifilm and others we found 
that Fuji X 10 sensor is better compared to Canon G12.</p> 
<p>The new sensor of <strong>fuji X S1 allows you Capture 3 exposures of the 
same scene</strong>with high-speed continuous shooting, each at a different 
dynamic range setting (100%, 200% and 400%).</p> 
<p>But we should not forget about canon SX 40 HS Sensor and image processor, 
Canon SX 40 HS uses newly developed BSI CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 image 
processor, the Digic 5 image processor creates 75% less noise and 6X faster 
compared to Digic 4 image processor,&nbsp; Due to new sensor and image 
processor you get more details and less noise in high ISO settings.</p> 
<p><strong>Multi-area White Balance in SX 40 HS</strong>: The Canon SX40 HS 
features advanced Multi-area White Balance optimizing color tones of both 
subject and background under multiple light sources.</p> 
<p>Nikon P500 image sensor captures more noise and less details compared to 
Canon SX 40 HS (See here).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Image Processor:</strong>&nbsp; Image processor of both Canon and 
Fuji are very fast, both can capture 10 shot/sec in high speed shooting mode, 
Nikon P500 is limited to 8 shot/sec only.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>RAW:</strong> Only Fujifilm X S1 features RAW format capture, 
<strong>&nbsp;Fujifilm X S1 features in camera RAW converter, </strong>The 
conversion of RAW data not only takes into account exposure compensation, white 
balance and other in-camera image quality control settings, but also lets the 
user apply Film Simulation modes in the converter mode. For PC you get</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>AF Points</strong>: Fuji not mentioned in its specification chart 
but during research we found that Fujifilm X S1 features 49 selectable AF 
points, Canon and Nikon Features 9 AF points.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>IS Image Stabilization</strong></p> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>
Fujifilm</strong> <strong>Canon SX 40 HS</strong> <strong>Nikon P500</strong> 
<br> <strong>Image Stabilization</strong> Optical Optical Sensor Shift and VR 
<br> <strong>IS Modes</strong><strong>(Hybrid IS)</strong> <strong>Not Available
</strong><strong></strong> <strong>Available </strong>(Normal, Macro, Panning, 
Dynamic, Powered, Tripod)<strong></strong> <strong>Not Available</strong> <br>

<br> 
<p><strong>Fuji Claims Fujifilm X S1 Equipped with a newly developed image 
stabilization</strong> mechanism, X-S1 effectively compensates for camera shake 
even when you press the shutter to capture a subject at extreme zoom. No 
further details available about the IS system of X S1.</p> 
<p><strong>Canon SX 40HS features 6 IS Modes and Optical IS</strong> The new 
Hybrid System of Canon SX 40 HS features Six &nbsp;Intelligent IS Modes, Canon 
SX 40 HS automatically chooses from six different modes (Normal, Macro, 
Panning, Dynamic, Powered, Tripod) to optimize image stabilization and help 
achieve crisp, blur-free images for various shooting conditions</p> 
<p>Nikon features <strong>Image sensor shift</strong>(not optical) + 
electronic vibration reduction (<strong>VR</strong>) function. Images captured 
with image sensor shift vibration reduction enabled are further processed with 
electronic VR for images that are sharper and exhibit less blur.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Lens and Aperture Range</strong></p> <strong>Camera / Specification
</strong> <strong>Fujifilm X S1</strong> <strong>Canon SX 40 HS</strong> 
<strong>Nikon P500</strong> <br>
<strong>Optical Zoom</strong> 26X 35X 36X <br>

<strong>Macro </strong> 1cm 0 cm 1 cm <br>
<strong>Aperture</strong> F2.8 
&ndash; F5.6 F2.7 &ndash; F5.8 F3.5 &ndash; F5.7 <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Based on lens quality, aperture and optical zoom range canon SX 40 
HS is a clear winner</strong>, Fujifilm Zoom lens is limited to 26X only.</p> 
<p>Canon features UD glass, double-sided aspherical glass-molded and 
ultra-high-refraction-index glass lens elements to effectively suppress 
chromatic aberration while maintaining a remarkably compact size. The camera 
uses a VCM (Voice Coil Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens 
movement with precise control.</p> 
<p>Similarly as canon, Fuji features high optical performance glass lens 
elements (aspherical, high refractive index, and ED glass lenses) make the 
exceptional brightness of F2.8 at wide angle and F5.6 at telephoto possible.</p>
<p>Nikon P500 features 36x Zoom and NIKKOR ED glass.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Shutter Speed</strong></p> 
<p><strong>You get more range in shutter speed in Fujifilm X S1</strong> 
compared to SX 40 HS or Nikon P500.</p> <strong>Shutter Speed</strong> <strong>
Fujifilm X S1</strong> <strong>Canon SX 40 HS</strong> <strong>Nikon P500
</strong> <br>
<strong>Max</strong> 4000 Sec 3200 Sec 1/1500 Sec <br>
<strong>
Min</strong> 30 Sec 15 Sec 2 Sec <br>
<strong>Continuous Shot</strong><strong>
</strong> 10 Shot/Sec 10.3 Shot/Sec 8 Shot/Sec <br>
<br>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Movie Mode</strong></p> 
<p>All the three Megazoom camera offers Full HD Video recording and AF during 
Video mode. Fuji offers Full HD at 30 fps, Canon Full HS at 24 fps and Nikon 
Full HD at 30 fps.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;Display:</strong> Practically I like Canon vari-angle 
display, but<strong>Nikon Wins here</strong>, Nikon P500 features 3&Prime; 
&nbsp;Tilting Screen with&nbsp; 921,000 screen dots and Fully articulated 
2.7&Prime; LCD with &nbsp;230,000 Screen dots.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Viewfinder:</strong> <strong>Fuji is a clear winner</strong>, it 
features a 0.47-inch superb high resolution viewfinder (approx. 1440,000 screen 
dots)&nbsp; with eye sensor.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Batter Life</strong>: Based on CIPA rating the <strong>Fujifilm X 
S1 battery life is better compared to Canon SX40 HS and Nikon P500</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Size and Weight</strong>: <strong>Nikon wins here</strong>, The 
Fuji weight and Size is similar to entry level DSLRs, Fuji weight (Max) 920g 
and have bigger body Compared to Canon and Nikon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Price</strong></p> <strong>Camera Models</strong> <strong>Fujifilm 
X S1</strong> <strong>Canon SX 40 HS</strong> <strong>Nikon P500</strong> <br>

<strong>Price </strong>(List Price) $800 $429 $399 <br>
<br>

<p>The Price of Fujifilm is just double the price of current Megazoom camera, 
will you pay double price for a bit bigger sensor or you will buy Canon or 
nikon?</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Overall Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Best Megazoom</strong>: If you want a MegaZoom Camera <strong>Canon 
SX40 HS is a clear winner</strong>, canon SX 40 HS 35X Zoom Lens features 
excellent optics with Hybrid IS, Fujifilm X S1 is limited to 26X only.<br>

<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Buy Fujifilm X S1 from Amazon || Amazon UK</strong><br>
<strong>Buy 
Canon SX 40 HS fromAmazon || Amazon UK || Adorama || B&amp;H</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Image quality and dynamic range: Fujifilm X S1 Wins here</strong>, 
The X S1 uses same sensor as pro compact camera X10, you get RAW file, more 
control over the dynamic range while shooting.<br>

<p>Very nice comparison review, the fuji weight, size and price is similar to 
DSLR, better to buy a Nikon D3100 with 70-300mm Lens &hellip;.</p> 
<p>Fuji should take down the price to make a real competition with canon or 
Nikon.</p> </li>
