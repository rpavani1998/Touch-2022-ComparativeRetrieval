<p> &laquo; Canon EOS 1DS Mark III: a Medium Format Killer? | Main | McNamara 
Report Resurrected? Perhaps. &raquo; </p> 
<h3>Nikon Confusion over Dots vs. Pixels</h3> 
<p>Since the beginning of digital time, photographers&mdash;and many 
manufacturers&ndash;have gotten confused over the differences between dots per 
inch (dpi) and pixels per inch (ppi). The terms are often 
interchanged&mdash;but they shouldn&rsquo;t be, especially when it comes to 
describing printer or camera resolution. Why? A printer may use 6 or more dots 
(from individual color cartridges) to form the image of a single full-color 
pixel captured by a camera or scanner. This helps to explain why a digital file 
with 200 ppi res can be printed at 600-5400 dpi depending on the printer and 
its output settings.) Now it looks like we&rsquo;ll have to add the way a 
camera or computer LCD monitor&rsquo;s resolution is described to the 
never-ending saga of dots vs pixels.</p> 
<p>Usually, maximum computer monitor resolution is listed in horizontal and 
vertical pixels. For example, a 17-inch laptop monitor might have a maximum 
resolution of 1280x1024-pixels (a very common resolution also called 
SXGA&ndash;Super Extended Graphics Array). On the other hand, most camera and 
camcorder LCD monitors are compared using the product of the horizontal and 
vertical pixels. For example, a camera with a 3-inch, 230,000 pixel resolution 
monitor (such the new Canon EOS 40D or EOS 1 Ds Mark III) gets that 230K figure 
by multiplying its vertical by horizontal pixel counts in the same way cameras 
often list their effective megapixel resolution by multiplying the 
sensor&rsquo;s horizontal and vertical pixel counts. (However, to describe the 
unique Foveon sensor in its cameras, Sigma uses the total number of sub-pixels 
found in the three overlapping RGB layers to total the SD14&rsquo;s megapixel 
count&mdash;a controversial practice).<br>
 In the recent announcement of the 
Nikon&rsquo;s D3 and D300 DSLRs, the resolution of the 3-inch LCD monitors on 
both of these cameras were described as either &ldquo;Ultrahigh-definition 
[(920,000-dot VGA (640x480)]&rdquo; or &ldquo;approximately 920,000 dot 
(VGA)&rdquo;. Fortunately, Nikon added that VGA tag in all of its literature to 
clarify the meaning of the specification. Unfortunately, many reviewers missed 
that and erroneously thought that the LCD had a super-high 920,000-pixel 
resolution&mdash;which would make it twice as sharp as the 230,000-pixel 
monitors on the new Canons (remember, it takes 4X as many pixels in a two 
dimensional array to equal twice the resolution). But a standard VGA monitor 
has 640 horizontal x 480 vertical pixels, equaling 307,000 pixels&ndash;so how 
can a monitor have both maximum resolutions (920,000 pixels and 307,000 
pixels)? Obviously, it can&rsquo;t&ndash;and Nikon never said it did.<br>
 To 
get the 920,000 dot figure, Nikon multiplied the individual RGB dots (often 
called sub-pixels) used in the stripe array to form a full color pixel.</p> 
<p>The math is easy: 640 x 480 x 3= @920,000 dots. This is an accepted method 
of describing LCD resolution within the LCD industry, and it is approved by 
CIPA. To my recollection it hasn't been used in the camera industry to describe 
LCD monitor resolution until now. Why did Nikon use this method? Perhaps 
because 920,000 dots sounds more impressive than saying 307,000 pixels, or 
perhaps because its engineers thought that was a more accurate way of writing 
out the spec? Either way, it describes a monitor with more pixels than any 
found on competitive camera LCDs (at least at the time of this posting).<br>
 
Frankly, I wish Nikon would stick to the pixel method of describing LCD monitor 
resolution, or that all manufacturers would agree to use dots but then describe 
the actual horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions of the screen (as Nikon did 
by giving the VGA tag). Dots all folks.</p> 
<p>For a more thorough description of LCD design, manufacturing techniques, 
resolution, and arrays (credited to Samsung Electronics, as is the array 
artwork in this blog), go to

<p><br>
 UPDATE 9/02/07: Dots not all, folks!<br>
 I've been getting several 
comments from readers declaring that Canon and other manufacturers regularly 
say &quot;pixels&quot; when they mean to say &quot;dots&quot; in their specs. 
None of these comments have included hard proof of this (spec sheets, links to 
Canon or other data, etc.), but that doesn't stop the opinions from declaring 
that I'm wrong, and Nikon's D3 and D300 screens with 920,000 dots are actually 
twice as sharp as previous 230,000 pixel LCDs (including Nikon's D2Xs screen). 
So, since I would like to stop deleting these comments and get on with my Labor 
Day weekend, I thought I'd post this information from Nikon's Steve Heiner, 
followed by a quote from the CIPA guidelines describing how a member company 
(Canon, et al) is supposed to describe LCD monitor resolution in its specs:</p> 
<p>A) Steve Heiner, Nikon: </p> 
<p><br>
 Difference between our new LCD and current LCD is the pixel number 
and filter array used.</p> 
<p>New LCD for D3/D300 has 640x480x3 (RGB Stripe array filter) = 921,600 dots. 
Rounded to 920,000 dots.</p> 
<p>Our current LCD (D2Xs) has 960x240 (Delta array filter) = 230,400 pixels. 
(Not 320x240x3)</p> 
<p>Stripe filter array LCD is more expensive but suits display geometrical 
data better (character, CG, line).</p> 
<p>Almost all DSC use Delta array LCD because of lower cost.</p> 
<p>B) CIPA Guideline: Number of Pixels/Dots: This means the number of 
effective pixels or dots of (picture/LCD) monitor, where the number means the 
effective pixels or dots of the area excluding all sections that do not 
contribute to the display of images or characters.<br>
 Incidentally, the 
relationship between the number of pixels and the number of dots is that: Three 
dots of consecutive R, G, and B dots constitute one pixel in a display by three 
primary colors, R, G, and B.</p>

<p>This is Sony technology inherited by Nikon.<br>
 The stripe RGB arrangement 
is a feature of Sony's trinitron tube developed back in the early 80s for the 
flatter CRT. This RGB arrangement has been inherited by their LCD on the D300 
and D3. The advantage of stripe over triad RGB is that it let out more 
backlight allowing the display to look brighter. It does not mean that what you 
get is high definition just a brighter and maybe cleaner example of a typical 
320x240 VGA display.</p> 
<p>Now you have your answer! <br>
</p> <br>

<p>Nice try, but I believe you have still got it wrong.</p> 
<p>The Delta array 960x240 'pixels' are still not pixels. They are dots or 
subpixels. These map to a standard QVGA 320x240 resolution. And how could it be 
otherwise? See it this way: You cannot map the screen dimensions to 960x240 
real pixels. The dimension ratio would be wrong. This is true for all Nikon and 
Canon cameras using the delta array LCD's.</p> 
<p>In contrast, the D3's stripe array maps to standard VGA resolution 
(640x480).</p> 
<p>So you've got the last part right but the 230K part wrong. Whichever way 
you look at it the D3 area resolution is 4 times as much as the old 230K QVGA 
LCDs.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Nikos | September 05, 2007 at 04:51 AM </p> <br>

<p>This isnt quite right. There is definately more RGB pods onthe D3 and D300 
but not in terms of area resolution which is similar to the 230k display of the 
Canon.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Wah Chan | September 05, 2007 at 05:11 AM </p> <br>

<p>I'm glad you shed light on a feature that Nikon is obviously intentionally 
trying to confuse the camera buying public with. Almost every preview of the 
D300 and D3 inteprets the dots as pixels when comparing them to Canon's 40D. I 
was actualy considering selling all of my gear and switching to Nikon, but not 
any more. Thanks again, I think you are the only to pick up on this!</p> <br>

<p>If the ultimate proof of Nikon's claim is that the resolution of the new 
LCD is twice that of Canon's (and former Nikon LCDs), then the side-by-side 
comparison now available on another prominent digital camera review site rather 
dramatically and convincingly supports Nikon. It is only a matter of time 
before PopPhoto also publishes the startling difference and those now saying 
&quot;shame on you&quot; to Nikon will be slinking away with tails between 
their legs.</p> <br>

<p>Confusing yes - but from what I've seen the D300 display is much better 
than the competition - oh well in 18 months everyone will have this (or at 
least this quality of a display), so the wait will be short. What's good for 
Nikon will be good for us all.</p>

<p>But Canon is also multiplying with three.</p> 
<p>Canon have 320 x 240 x 3 = 230 K<br>
 Nikon have 640 x 480 x 3 = 920 K</p> 
<p>The other math, without 3, would be:</p> 
<p>Canon: 320 x 240 = 76'800<br>
 Nikon: 640 * 480 = 307'200</p> 
<p>NIKON HAS 4X PIXELAMOUNT DONE.<br>
 Highschool math.</p> <br>

<p>intresting....we in fact now provide to our surveyors with the Nikon D300 
and would most probably do so at any time over Canon....the sharpness is very 
much visible.</p> <br>
