<h1>Field Review: Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE (Day 3 &ndash; Around 
Town)</h1>

<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - shot at ISO 400, f/5.0, 1/1000 sec</p> 
<p>I love shooting with primes and I love street/urban photography, so I was 
excited to get out and shoot with theCarl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE. With 
a focal length of 35mm, theCarl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE should feel 
right at home on the streets.</p>

<h2>The 35mm Focal Length</h2> 
<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at ISO 100, f/3.2, 1/2000 sec</p> 
<p>The Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE feels great mated to my 5D. A 35mm 
lens on a full frame body is great for environmental portraits and street 
photography. The 35mm focal length really is a must-have for anyone interested 
in shooting street/urban photography. It&rsquo;s a very natural focal length 
and by that I mean it produces a perspective that is close to what the human 
eye sees. I feel that this is important when reproducing photographs that 
depict everyday life. When paired with a crop body, theZeiss 35mm F/1.4 will 
end up being closer to a 50mm lens which is what I personally prefer to shoot 
with. If you shoot with a crop body, I would consider checking out theZeiss 
35mm F/1.4 for your 50mm equivalent lens.</p> 
<h2>Handling</h2> 
<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - Shot at ISO 400, f/7.1, 1/200 sec - No 
signs of flare</p> 
<p>After using the Carl Zeiss Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE for a few days, 
I&rsquo;ve started to get used to having to manually focus ALL of the time. As 
I stated in the last post, without focus confirmation or a different focusing 
screen, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use this lens. While theCanon 5D does have 
a nice big and bright viewfinder, I cannot always tell when I have my subject 
100% in focus. I have rediscovered that the markings on the lens can be your 
best friend. They allow you to zone focus or you can even preset your focus if 
you can guesstimate your distance from your subject before you bring the camera 
up to your face. This will drastically reduce your focus time once you have the 
camera up to your eye.</p> 
<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - Shot at ISO 100, f/5.6, 1/500 sec</p> 
<p>Instead of using my Camdapter hand strap, I decided to go back to my beloved
Black Rapid RS-7. As I said in my last post, at over 3lbs., this lens has a bit 
of a weight problem. Carrying this lens and a camera in your hand for an 
extended period of time can get old very quickly. I strongly suggest you pickup 
some sort of padded sling strap if you are going to carry a lens of this weight.
</p> 
<h2>Image Quality</h2> 
<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - Shot at ISO 100, f/5.6, 1/800 sec</p> 
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve had this lens for a few days, I&rsquo;ve been able to 
feel out this lens&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses. The good part is it only 
has a few weaknesses and one of them is dealing with back-lit subjects. Like 
most lenses, when you have a large amount of light pouring directly into the 
lens, your images are going to come out with less than ideal contrast and they 
will look washed out.</p> 
<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at ISO 100, f/2.8, 1/1600 sec</p> 
<p>As I said in the last post, Chromatic Aberration is apparent at the lenses 
widest apertures but it is not as bad as some of the other lenses I&rsquo;ve 
tested (e.g. Sigma 85mm F/1.4). I know this is a very expensive lens and many 
people will expect perfection fromZeiss (and I can&rsquo;t say that I blame 
them) but I try not to worry about things that can easily be fixed in post 
processing. So the lens has a hint of CA, I personally don&rsquo;t have a 
problem with this because the lens excels in other areas that make CA a 
non-issue for me.</p> 
<p>I personally think the Zeiss 35mm&lsquo;s biggest weakness when compared to 
the competition is the lack of AF, but I&rsquo;ll get into that in the next 
section.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me all wrong, the Zeiss 35mm is not all bad. Beyond the 
build quality and great looks, this lens produces excellent results. I&rsquo;ve 
said this before and I&rsquo;ll say it again, this lens produces images that 
have an unexplainable uniqueness to them; subjects seem to really pop from the 
background areas. Also, I enjoy having to slow down and put thought into what 
I&rsquo;m shooting.</p> 
<h2>Concerns</h2> 
<p>Canon 5D with Zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - shot at ISO 400, f/5.0, 1/125 sec</p> 
<p>I honestly thought this issue would come up before day 3 of the review, but 
it really reared its ugly head when I was out shooting in town. The issue 
I&rsquo;m talking about is the lack of AF. I know, I know, AF isn&rsquo;t 
everything and there was a time when AF wasn&rsquo;t an option but there are 
times when AF<em>really</em> comes in handy. I missed a few shots that I would 
have love to have nailed but the lack of AF really restricted me from getting 
the shot. Maybe if I had more time to practice with the lens I would have 
nailed the shots, maybe not. I&rsquo;ve become so accustomed to AF that I 
couldn&rsquo;t react quickly enough in order to get the shot.</p> 
<p>So should the lack of AF be a mark against the lens? Honestly, I 
don&rsquo;t think it should be. This lens is what it is. It may not be the 
ideal lens in all situations, but what lens is? I think if you can live with 
occasionally missing a shot or if you want to dedicate time to perfecting your 
manual focusing technique, then you will be more than happy with theZeiss 35mm 
F/1.4.</p>

Distagon T* 35mm F/1.4 ZE to a birthday part.</p>
