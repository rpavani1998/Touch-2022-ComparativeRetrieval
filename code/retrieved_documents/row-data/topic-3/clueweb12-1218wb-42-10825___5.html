<h3>March 5th, 2012 </h3> Nikon D700&prime;s Amazing High ISO Capabilities 
<p>On our recent Winter Photography tour to Yellowstone National Park I had a 
chance to capture some exciting images that just would not have been possible 
without the high ISO capabilities of the Nikon D700. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in 
the past, I typically shoot two D7000 bodies and I have one D700 for situations 
where the light is very poor. Below is a video I created from still images that 
I shot of two coyotes fighting over breeding rights and territorial dominancy. 
All the photos were shot at 2500 ISO except for the last image which was shot 
at 1600 ISO. This situation was exactly the type of opportunity I keep my D700 
around for.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Why was the D700 so advantageous? First, these two aggressive creatures 
were moving very, very fast. I was shooting a 600mm lens due to the distance we 
needed to maintain. Fast motion and powerful telephotos require a faster 
shutter speed. The old rule of thumb is a shutter speed equal to or greater 
than the length of the lens you are shooting and that&rsquo;s if you just want 
to steady minor lens shake from hand holding. These images were shot at 
1/1600th of a second to make sure we stopped the action. Additional reasons for 
needing the ability to go to a higher ISO was the relatively low light due to 
it being early morning with heavy overcast and falling snow. All of these 
issues required the use of a great sensor that can handle low-light conditions 
with ease. The D700 is the go-to camera for conditions of this type.</p>

<h3>March 4th, 2012 </h3> Canon Announces Their New EOS 5D Mark III 
<p>Canon recently announced the newest version of the hugely poplar Canon ESO 
5D Mark III. Interestingly, this is the camera apparently meant to compete with 
the new Nikon D800, yet the two cameras are SUBSTANTIALLY &nbsp;different. 
Nikon chose a huge 36 megapixel sensor. Canon has gone with 22 megapixels. 
Nikon has a built-in flash. The EOS does not. Nikon shoots 4 fps in FX mode. 
The Canon shoots 6 fps. Nikon has given us several options for changing the 
camera over to a DX format which also increases the frame rate. The Canon has 
no such options. The D800 tops out at a standard ISO of 6400. The EOS 5D Mark 
III is 25,600 and the list of differences go on.As I mentioned in an earlier 
post, it seems there is another camera missing from Nikon&rsquo;s lineup that 
truly would be a competitor to the EOS 5D Mark III.</p>

<h3>March 2nd, 2012 </h3> A Mixed Bag of Photo Techniques, Climate Change and 
Damn Tired 
<p>Sometimes to get inspired to write I just have to let things flow. 
That&rsquo;s what the first part (the top) of this blog is all about. The good 
stuff is towards the middle and below. Skip to that if you don&rsquo;t care for 
my period of warming up. There&rsquo;s a tip on wildlife ethics as well as the 
pros and cons of fullframe/non-fullframe cameras. To get you started 
here&rsquo;s an image of what the middle and end is all about.</p>

<h3>February 11th, 2012 </h3> What Do YOU Think About Nikon&rsquo;s Two New 
DSLR&rsquo;s &ndash; D800 &amp; D4? 
<p>I just returned from an extended time away from the studio, traveling to 
Kenya and Costa Rica. During my time away Nikon announced information on their 
two newest DSLR&rsquo;s and they are both very interesting. I&rsquo;ve not had 
a chance to handle either the D800 or D4 at this point but Nikon has agreed to 
send me one of each a week or two after they start delivering the pre orders.
</p> 
<p><strong>D800 Incorporates a 36 Megapixel Sensor<br>
</strong>I have to say 
that I was a bit surprised by the rumor of 36 megapixels coming true. 
Understand that I was one of the very few photographers who actually bought 
Nikon&rsquo;s D2H that sported a measly 4.1 megapixel sensor. You don&rsquo;t 
remember that camera? Most don&rsquo;t but I shot it for two years and 
I&rsquo;ve never had an editor or any photo buyer complain about the lack of 
resolution from the images I captured with that body. Keep in mind all D2H 
files were sized up throughGenuine Fractals&nbsp;now known as Perfect Resize 
but nobody has ever been the wiser. Additionally, I shot that camera like I do 
all digital cameras which means I shot it as if I were shooting 35mm film. In 
other words I rarely cropped the final image. The files were actually quite 
good from the D2H unless you went over 400 ISO. In short, the sensor produced 
great images to start with when using a low ISO and then Genuine Fractals did 
the rest. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve supplied dozens of images to a German calendar 
publisher that were proceed from the D2H and these guys are picky. They never 
published any calendar we did together that featured the photography smaller 
than 16&times;20 inches and never &nbsp;once &nbsp;did they complain.</p>

<h3>November 29th, 2011 </h3> Photography Using Nikon&rsquo;s Flexible Program 
Mode 
<p>I recently received a question via my LinkedIn Nikon Photographers Forum 
that I tried to answer via LinkedIn. However, due to the length of the answer I 
decided to bring it over here to my blog. The question is, &ldquo;what shooting 
mode do most photographs use?&rdquo; You can read my thoughts below.</p> 
<p><strong>Nikon&rsquo;s Flexible Program Mode</strong></p> 
<p>I use what Nikon refers to as Flexible Program Mode or the P setting 98% of 
the time. As most of the comments above show, using anything but Manual or 
Aperture priority is not very popular. However, I believe if more photographers 
would investigate the benefits of the Flexible Program option, in the Nikon 
system, they would come to understand the tremendous benefits. I specifically 
state Nikon since Canon&rsquo;s version of the Flexible Program is a bit 
different and can be frustrating to rely on.</p>

<h3>October 25th, 2011 </h3> PhotoPlus Expo Starts Tomorrow-I&rsquo;ll Be 
Covering Right Here 
<p>I just flew into New York in preparation for PDN PhotoPlus International 
Conference &amp; Expo. I&rsquo;ve been attending this show for nearly twenty 
years, sometimes as a guest of Nikon and others, sometimes just on my own. This 
trip qualifies as just on my own. It&rsquo;s a great trade show, all the big 
players are here from Nikon, Canon, HP, Sandisk, Lowepro and lots of others. I 
haven&rsquo;t been to New York for a couple of years so I decided it was time 
to pack my bags and head east. It&rsquo;s always nice to reacquaint myself with 
some of the folks we work with on a regular basis but hardly ever actually see.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> Nikon 1 V1 Mirrorless Camera </dd> </dl> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll be snooping and pocking and asking lots of questions about this, 
that and lots of other things. I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers that we may see 
the newest pro or semi-pro Nikon body. However, I&rsquo;m not holding my 
breath. Lots of rumors out in cyberspace regarding the devastation Nikon has 
endured in Thailand due to colossal flooding. Imagine the turmoil they must be 
going through created by the flood in Thailand the earthquake, tsunami and 
nuclear radiation event in Japan and the downturn in the world economy. It 
can&rsquo;t be easy but amazingly they are more savvy than I have ever seen in 
the nearly 30 years I&rsquo;ve worked with them. Nikon has actually become 
amainzgly astute at marking. That was not always the case. Back in the 
1980&prime;s you would have never seen anyone remotely similar toAshton Kutcher 
helping sell Nikon cameras. Ashton is a great asset for all of us wanting 
better and more sophisticated photographic tools. If Nikon can sell to the 
masses, the technology and research eventually makes it over to the more 
serious professional side. It&rsquo;s good for everyone wanting to capture 
great memories.</p> 
<p>My first stop will be the Nikon booth where I hope to see the new 
enthusiast cameras they recently announced, the Nikon J1 and V1. boththese 
cameras are apparently doing very well. I&rsquo;m hoping to get my hands on one 
or both to give them a good once over. Might even be able to talk my friends in 
to letting me give them a try. Stay tuned and stop by to see what I come up 
with. I&rsquo;ll be blogging from the show each day.</p>

<h3>October 1st, 2011 </h3> Nikon Joins the Mirrorless Camera Game 
<p>About two weeks ago I posted an entry on the Corkboard titled&nbsp;<em>My 
Predictions of Changes in Camears Coming True</em>. &nbsp;It was a short piece 
that included a news item from Bloomberg highligihting the Mirrorless 
revolution taking place with nearly all camera manufacturers except Nikon and 
Canon. Well, a lot of things can change in two weeks and so they have with 
Nikon finally joining the Mirrorless group with their introduction of a new 
line of photographic tools called the Nikon 1 J1 and the Nikon 1 V1.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nikon 1 V1 Mirrorless Camera</p> 
<p>With the introduction of these two cameras they have brought some 
interesting new technologies to the game that sound quite interesting. However, 
they also chose to go with a considerably smaller digital sensor than any of 
their major competitors. For example theSony NEX7 uses a digital capture sensor 
with a 1.5X magnification factor.Olympus and Panasonic chose the Micro 
4/3&prime;s route with a magnification factor of 2X. Nikon decided to go with 
an even smaller sensor that has a magnification factor of 2.7X. Below 
I&rsquo;ve included a graphic provided byCameraDebate.com that gives you an 
easier to understand visual of the differences between all these different 
sized digital capture sensors. Please note that the size of the visuals are not 
the actual size of the sensors but rather size comparisons of all options.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So the good news is that Nikon has finally joined the game and that is a 
tremendous plus. However, the possibly not so good news is, they chose to go 
with such a minuscule sensor. We&rsquo;ll all have to wait to see if this will 
be a serious flaw to the new line of Nikon cameras since in general, smaller 
sensors produce lower quality images. For photographers that put a tremendous 
emphasis on image quality I&rsquo;ll remain concerned until I see samples 
I&rsquo;ve shot for myself. Who knows maybe Nikon will pull another&nbsp;rabbit 
out of their hat as they did with the sensor in the D3 and D700. If so these 
cameras could be amazing. If not then they will only be cameras for the point 
and shoot crowd. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m really hoping they will be AMAZING!</p> 
<p>Some of the more interesting new features in the Nikon 1 V1 include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The capability to capture a still image even while recording in 1080P 
movie mode.</li> 
<li>73 Point AF sensors across the entire viewfinder</li> 
<li>12 Million pixel sensor</li> 
<li>Color LCD Viewfinder</li> 
<li>Frames Per Second equal 10, 30, 60</li> 
<li>Entire new lens system but also will have the ability to use traditional F 
series lenses.</li> 
<li>Movie Slow Motion</li> 
<li>Smart Photo Selector for best image suggested by camera.</li> </ul>

<h3>August 25th, 2011 </h3> Arctic Documentary Project &ndash; Svalbard, 
Norway Final Post #5 
<p><strong>August 10, Dansk&oslash;ya Island 37F</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Click on this link to see photos of our favorite images from the 
Svalbard shoot for the Arctic Documentary Project.<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>This morning is cold. Most definitely the coolest we&rsquo;ve experienced. 
Dansk&oslash;ya Island is on the northwest part of the archipelago and is on 
the edge of better polar bear habitat. The ice is nearly 80 miles offshore, so 
any bears that are stranded on the Islands of Svalbard migrate towards the top 
getting as close to the ice pack as possible. Mark tells me that, 
&ldquo;typically the ice is 15-20 miles offshore but this year is 
unusual.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surprising how often I keep hearing something similar to 
&ldquo;this year is unusual&rdquo; from people that work in the arctic. 
That&rsquo;s been the description for hotter than normal temperatures and the 
varying climatic changes they&rsquo;ve caused. Equally amazing is that I first 
started hearing people talk about the &ldquo;unusual year&rdquo; over ten years 
ago.&nbsp;My wife Tanya is stepping in here to describe our morning and the 
rest of the day as we head further north and east.</p>

<h3>August 11th, 2011 </h3> Arctic Documentary Project &ndash; Svalbard, 
Norway Post #4: Second Trip 
<p><strong>August 8, 2011, Cloudy and 43F</strong></p> 
<p>Tanya and I spent the past three days in Lonyearbyen in a small, very 
European, apartment, catching up on business matters, writing and a little rest 
before our next group of guests arrived.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tanya and Dan in the rented apartment having dinner.</p> 
<p>The first trip went really well, but every adventure to the field is new, 
so it&rsquo;s always in your mind that the the next can be even better. Our 
boat is full again, housing our eight invited photo enthusiasts that all 
arrived on schedule. Jeanne, one of our dear and long-time friends, and a 
retired, 30-year 757 pilot for United Airlines, arrived in Longyearbyen minus 
her luggage. True to form she had a huge smile on her face and lots of great 
stories about the turmoil she faced trying to explain to the &ldquo;lost 
luggage department&rdquo; where they needed to deliver her bags once they found 
them. The story Jeanne described, as usual, was hilarious with the central 
theme pivoting on the idea that the agent just could not get the concept that 
the boat she was scheduled to board was something smaller than the typical 1500 
passenger cruise ship. And, unlike the cruise ships, there was no port she 
would be visiting that had an SAS office she could check in with. Suffice it to 
say, it&rsquo;s people like Jeanne who take a very bad situation and turn it 
into a comedy routine, that makes this job so worthwhile.Read the rest of this

<h3>August 5th, 2011 </h3> Aperture Applet-GPS Info in Aperture for the ADP 
<p>Niko's GPS GP-1 Unit for D7000 camera body </p> 
<p>Just going through some of my images and wanted to share a very interesting 
and worthwhile feature I&rsquo;m exploring within Aperture. Before I left I 
purchased theNikon GPS unit GP-1 for the D7000. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of 
labeling the exact location of every photo but for the Arctic Documentary 
Project this technology is a tremendous asset.</p> 
<p>I hooked this little device up to the D7000 several times and it recorded 
those images with an exact GPS location that are noted as a small red pin on 
the Places section within Aperture. I can see this being extremely useful for 
documenting specific areas within the arctic for the Arctic Documentary 
Project. Could not be any more accurate way of making sure an image is placed 
in exactly the right time and place in history for future generations to 
compare their current imagery to. This is just one more small but very useful 
tool that Aperture brings to the table and one of several reasons I decided to 
start using this software. The one downside is that the device plugs into the 
side of the camera and makes it a bit uncomfortable to hold not to mention 
I&rsquo;ve bent the connection at least twice. Was easy enough to straighten 
out but I&rsquo;m guessing the connection is going to give at some point if I 
continue doing that. Will be extremely nice once all cameras have this 
technology built in and able to turn on and off at will.</p>

<h3>August 5th, 2011 </h3> Arctic Documentary Project &ndash; Svalbard, Norway 
Post #3: Whales, Walrus, Bears and Seals 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>July 27 &ndash; Clear skies, Temp Around 45F</strong></p> 
<p>Sailing into the midnight sun, Svalbard, Norway. Nikon D7000</p> 
<p>The weather continues bright and sunny. For two days now we&rsquo;ve had 
skies with virtually no clouds. Some wind yesterday afternoon but amazingly if 
it weren&rsquo;t for the desolate landscape, void of vegetation, and cool 
temps, I would swear we were cruising the Bahamas. Last night Mark downloaded 
the ice chart and the pack ice is 80 miles to the north. The past two days 
we&rsquo;ve managed to find two separate groups of walrus. The first on Moffen 
Island, a restricted refuge we&rsquo;re not allowed to enter. Regulations state 
that even our ship must remain 300 meters out from shore. Surprisingly, with 
all the necessary restrictions we had a fairly productive shoot capturing 
walrus coming and going. We were all thrilled to be taking pictures.</p> 
<p>After Moffen we made our way down to Murchisonfjorden and spent the night 
anchored in a calm bay. The midnight sun cast its long shadows throughout the 
early hours of the AM. Rising from my bunk and making my way into the galley 
was painful due to the intense glare off the water. The brilliance sent me 
scurrying back to my dark, little cabin to retrieve sunglasses before making my 
way on deck. Unfortunately my mini travel thermometer is no longer working. 
I&rsquo;m disappointed not to be able to get an accurate reading of the outside 
temps. I&rsquo;ll be getting something a bit more robust for my travels in the 
future but for now the air temperature feels something close to 45F. It&rsquo;s 
a guess but enough time in the outdoors makes it relatively accurate.</p> 
<p>We finally get moving around 9:30am. Mornings are always difficult in the 
far north since it&rsquo;s all too easy to be out hours on end in the the 
glorious light of the midnight sun. As we slowly make our way out of the waters 
of Murchisonfjorden we find a pair of walrus seemingly lolly gagging but very 
possibly feeding in the serene waters of the fjord. We set the engine to 
neutral and drifted slowly, hoping they might get curious and come visit. No 
such luck. After 20-30 minutes we decide to slowly motor off towards the mouth 
of the fjord.</p>

<h3>July 25th, 2011 </h3> Arctic Documentary Project &ndash; Svalbard, Norway 
Post #2: Polar Bear Sighting 
<p><strong>July 23, 2012</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Polar bears feeding on the carcass of a Fin Whale. Svalbard, Norway</p> 
<p>Two years ago on my first trip to Svalbard we found a dead whale, floating 
in the waters of Holmiabukta. It was partially beached, the underside of its 
large, bloated carcass coming aground on the bottom of the fjord, 50 feet or 
more from the gray, rocky shoreline recently void of ice. During our original 
visit we spent several days working the nearly dozen or so bears that were 
feasting on the Cetaceation&rsquo;s rotting flesh. It was a surreal site, 
sometimes four polar bears distributed its length, standing their ground, their 
teeth tearing at the hide of the ghastly, bloated corpse. A young ice bear, 
maybe 3-4 years in age, gorged itself as a mother and two cubs came swimming 
from shore. The moment she boarded the bobbing smorgasbord of blubber, skin and 
barnacles, the feasting young bruin came sprinting down the carcass length, 
diving off the other end, leaping into the water in a full race horse gallop. 
Gulls scattered in every direction lifting off to hang in the gusting winds 
blowing from the glacier. There in the midst of darkest death was the angelic 
like wings of an Ivory Gull as purely white as its name described, a bird of 
such beauty in this scene of death.Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</p>

<h3>July 21st, 2011 </h3> Arctic Documentary Project -Svalbard, Norway Post 
#1: Montana to Fidembukta Harbor. 
<p><strong>July 20, 2011</strong></p> 
<p>Our trip from Montana was uneventful &ndash; though flying anymore I find 
literally painful. When Tanya and I travel overseas we always plan to arrive at 
least a day early, ideally two or even three. Acclimating to a new time zone 
slowly can make all the difference on the first part of any adventure. In 
today&rsquo;s world we are all very busy, and for most it&rsquo;s exceptionally 
difficult to take even one more day away from work, but we suggest to all our 
guests to try and come early. The first day of your adventure is invariably 
more enjoyable if you can spare the time.</p> 
<p>We broke our trip up by staying one night in Oslo. Our hotel was a Best 
Western not far from where we landed and it was typically European with very 
small rooms but an equally comfortable bed. The night passed quickly, never 
really getting dark. Around 10:00am we caught the well-organized, pleasant and 
clean bus to the airport.</p> 
<p><strong>PHOTO TIP<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Keeping a camera close has always been the answer to great pictures. 
It&rsquo;s never been easer to be prepared for that special image that presents 
itself. I carry a small body with a minimum of 28mm lens to record special 
moments that I find while traveling. There are so many great options to choose 
from today such as Nikon advanced Coolpix 5700. The photo of this unique 
looking, early European design car caught my eye while waiting for the bus to 
the airport. I took out my small, go anywhere camera and shot these pictures.

<h3>July 19th, 2011 </h3> Svalbard Photo Equipment List 
<p><strong>July 18, 2011</strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>Pro Roller X200 Inside can be removed and hard shell sent to the baggage 
compartment</p> 
<p>Yesterday I received a note on Facebook from a friend of mine in South 
Africa. He saw the picture I posted of Tanya with all our bags and asked if 
there was any camera gear inside.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve traveled together so his 
comment was just a friendly poke. This business of taking pictures creates a 
lot of baggage. His comment made me think that I should give some details on 
all that I&rsquo;ve brought for our shoot in Svalbard, Norway.</p> 
<p>First of all when Tanya and I travel together and particularly when we 
leave North America I almost always use the Lowepro Roller bags. Since there 
are two of us we can often take more on board the aircraft than I can when 
traveling alone. If I am traveling solo I will often use a Lowerpro backpack of 
some sort placed within a large, Pelican, hard sided case and checked as 
luggage. I like the Pro Roller option the best since obviously I can keep my 
eye on my gear.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A minimal backpack harness good for short hauls onto a plane or a few 
hundred yards to a blind.</p> 
<p>The Pro roller I currently us is the Pro Roller X200. Not the largest they 
make in the Pro Roller series but not the smallest either. What&rsquo;s 
particularly interesting about this case is it&rsquo;s semi-transformer 
personality. It&rsquo;s a bit large for smaller planes overhead bins but with a 
quick zip of the inner case, you can reduce it&rsquo;s size substantially. By 
zipping out the inside protective enclosure you remove the hard sided outer 
shell. On the back side of the inner case are backpack straps that make it easy 
to sling over your shoulders. More than once I&rsquo;ve had the folks at the 
gate suggest my rolling strong box was too large for aircraft carryon. Quickly 
I can zip out the inside and hand them the outer shell, eliminating the 
concern. The inside fits nicely in virtually all aircraft bins I&rsquo;ve ever 
needed access to.</p>

Tours, ADP and Polar Bears International 
<p><strong>June 10, 2011</strong></p> 
<p>My last trip to Svalbard was almost two years ago. Soon I will be there 
again and this blog post is the beginning of my report from what is an 
incredible land of ice, water, wildlife and sky. If you&rsquo;re interested you 
can read about my last Trip to this amazing wilderness on our&nbsp; 
Blog/Corkboard.</p> 
<p>A polar bear makes its way over barren rocks surrounded by patches of snow 
near Svalbard, Norway.</p> 
<p>This time my wife Tanya is accompanying me. We&rsquo;ve incorporated this 
trip into ourInvitational Photo Tours schedule so we&rsquo;ll be meeting 
numerous guests who&rsquo;ve become friends and a few new faces that have never 
traveled with us before. You can find out more about the details of our cruise 
in the spectacular waters of Norway by visiting ourInvitational Photo Tours web 
page. Here you will find all the details and if you like&nbsp; you can even 
signup for the same adventure yourself for next year. Yep, we&rsquo;ll be doing 
it all again in 2012.</p>

<h3>November 9th, 2010 </h3> Hoping Nikon Steps Up to the Challenge of a 
Disappointing GF2 
<p>Panasonic recently announced the new GF2 and I am sorely disappointed. 
Here&rsquo;s why. I fell in love with the GF1 for several reasons. It was 
reasonably small (not too small), has interchangeable lenses, has some (not 
enough) out of menu, manual controls, produces extremely high quality RAW 
files, has almost no shutter lag and has the feel and build of a Leica 
rangefinder To me it was a phenomenal first step for Panasonic and their 
efforts to enter the SERIOUS still photography market. However, as much as I 
love the GF1 it isn&rsquo;t perfect and Panasonic had the chance to fix all of 
that in the GF2. I was hoping desperately the new improvements would take the 
Panasonic line of mirrorless cameras to the next level. With the announcement 
of the GF2 Panasonic seems to have taken two steps back when they could have 
gone two steps forward.</p>

<h3>April 7th, 2010 </h3> Gear for the Brown Bear Photography Adventure 
<p>Mother brown bear plays with her cubs</p> 
<p>Our Alaskan Brown Bear trip is fast approaching and I wanted to take a few 
minutes to post some information for those of you who plan to join us. For 
those of you reading this that may still have an interest we do have two spots 
open for the spring adventure. The dates are June 18-25. Give Tanya a call if 
you&rsquo;re interested.</p> 
<p>Summer brown bear photography in Alaska has a few special requirements. 
I&rsquo;ll start with clothing then move on to photography equipment. First and 
foremost when in the Alaska wilderness you want to make sure you stay dry so I 
highly recommend bringing a good quality rain/waterproof jacket. Not 
necessarily a rubber coat but Gore-tex or equivalent is ideal. I&rsquo;ll be 
wearing a Mountain Hardware breathable, outer shell. I&rsquo;ll also have a 
fleece inner coat incase the temperature drops, as it can in the north. 
I&rsquo;ll be wearing a capalene tshirt under a heavier outer shirt. The 
capalene is essential for keeping you dry next to the skin and makes a huge 
difference if you somehow get wet.Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</p>
