<h2>Canon EOS 1D MkIV vs Nikon D3S Features</h2> <br>
 These flagship cameras 
are designed for superior speed, image quality in low light and are built to 
take the rough and tumble of daily use, as required by press photo 
photographers, who may be required to work in difficult conditions, day in, day 
out. Advances in sensor technology in the last year or so have produced cameras 
that are able to take images in incredibly difficult condition, at very high 
sensitivities, that just wouldn't have been possible with film.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Here is a quick summary of each camera's main features with any superior 
features highlighted. For the purposes of this comparison, the latest firmware 
has been installed on each camera.<br>

 It is 
clear to see, that there is little to choose between the two cameras on paper, 
which is to be expected as both cameras are right on the bleeding edge of 
technology for this type of camera. There are some areas where one camera 
scores over another, but only by very slight margins. For example, the Canon 
has a slightly higher resolution sensor, is slightly lighter and has a higher 
resolution video mode, whereas the Nikon is capable of shooting at higher 
speeds in DX crop mode, and has a marginally higher resolution screen.<br>
<br>

 The major separator between the two cameras is the size of the sensor. Canon 
have opted to retain the APS-H size sensor of previous 1D-series models, 
whereas the D3S has a 35mm full frame sensor. The advantages of the crop are 
with longer telephoto lenses, where the narrower angle of view recorded allows 
for tighter crops with shorter lenses. For example, a 300mm lens on the Canon 
will give roughly the same view as a 400mm lens on the Nikon. The downside of 
this is that it may be difficult to source lenses at the wider end for the 
Canon. Nikon's 14-24mm f/2.8 lens has garnered a superb reputation and is 
perfect for getting in close to the action. Currently Canon's widest zoom lens 
is the EF 16-35mm f/2.8L USM, which with the 1.3 crop factor, will provide an 
angle of view equivalent to a 21mm lens. Also, the lower resolution of the 
Nikon, coupled with the larger sensor size results in larger photosites on the 
sensor, which should also result in better noise performance at high ISO 
sensitivities. The purpose of this comparison will be to see where the 
differences lie and weather either camera has a clear advantage in any key 
areas, such as AF or ISO performance of handling.<br>
<br>

<h2>Canon EOS 1D MkIV vs Nikon D3S: Handling</h2> <br>
 From a distance, if 
the manufacturer's logos were obscured, it would be very difficult to tell each 
camera apart, save for the red flash on the grip of the D3S. Both cameras are 
virtually the same size and weight, and the extra 60g the D3S weighs over the 
Canon is virtually imperceivable.<br>
<br>
 Both cameras are incredibly 
well-built, as you might expect and you really have to look closely to find any 
clear differences. With the lens removed, the larger lens mount of the Canon is 
an obvious difference, as is the size of the viewfinder matte screen, which can 
be seen reflected in the reflex mirror. When viewed from the rear, the large 
selector dial sets the Canon apart fro the Nikon, as does the design of the 
viewfinder eyepiece, with Nikon opting for a larger circular design. The LCD 
screens on both cameras are bright and clear, making reviewing images and 
navigating menus a pleasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Both camera are a similar size 
and weight. The smaller viewfinder reflection in the mirror of the Canon is due 
to the smaller APS-H sensor.<br>
<br>
 Basic features like information screens 
and memory card slots are very similarly designed on both cameras. Both cameras 
sport an intuitive control layout, although the tiny joystick controller on the 
Canon can be difficult to reach when shooting in portrait orientation.<br>
<br>

<br> Looking more closely at the Canon, connections for HDMI output, a 
microphone, remote release and a PC flash socket are all located on the outside 
edge under rubber flaps, which can be rotated out of harms way.<br>
<br>
 The 
weather sealed memory card door is opened by rotating a small latch on the 
rear. Inside are a slot for a Compactflash card, and one for SD/SDHC, but not 
SDXC as yet. The slots can each be configured to receive Raw files or JPEGs 
independently or simultaneously as a backup, or one card can be designated for 
videos, whilst the other records images. It's a nice feature to have, but I 
find it a little strange that the photographer would have to carry two separate 
card formats to make the most of this feature.<br>
<br>
 The large LP-E4 
battery has a capacity of 2300mAh and comes as a one-piece unit with the 
weather sealed cover permanently attached, making swift battery changes a 
doddle. The camera feel s very comfortable to hold in either portrait or 
landscape orientations, thanks in part to the soft rubber that covers much of 
the body. However the placement of the small joystick controller means that it 
can be difficult to reach when shooting in portrait orientation, at least 
without some finger gymnastics to reach across the rear of the body. Other 
controls are very well placed, and although the buttons aren't overly large, 
they can be operated easily enough with gloves, as they stand proud from the 
camera body.<br>
<br>
<br>
Connections for HDMI, USB, microphone, remote 
release and a PC socket are all located on the side of the camera. One socket 
for a Compactflash card and one for an SD card are included. Each can be 
configured to accept Raw files, JPEGs, or video but it strikes me as a bit odd 
having to carry two separate card formats to use this facility. <br>
<br>
The 
viewfinder eyepiece provides plenty of nose clearance. A dioptre adjustment 
control is located under the rubber eye cup. The 2300mAh LP-E4 battery comes as 
one unit with the clip attached permanently, making quick battery changes 
straightforward. <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 Large rubber flaps cover the USB port, 
HDMI, microphone, AV out and the mains power connection. The remote release and 
PC sync socket are located separately on the front, also protected by 
individual rubber covers. The flaps cannot be moved out of the way and tend to 
spring back over the connections, which can be a little awkward. Also the 
location of the PC socket can occasionally lead to the connection becoming 
loose when using the camera in portrait orientation, as it is very easy to 
nudge it when supporting the lens with your hand. Other than that, all the 
buttons and controls are easily accessible making the camera very easy to use 
under pressure. The buttons for menus and other features are nice and large, 
which makes operation with gloves bearable, although the ISO, image quality and 
white balance controls could do with being larger, as they can be a little 
fiddly.<br>
<br>
 Just as with the Canon, soft rubber grips cover much of the 
exterior, making the camera very comfortable to hold. The memory card door is 
located under the grip on the rear and is released by lifting a metal guard and 
pressing a button. Inside are two Compactflash slots, capable of being 
configured in much the same way as the Canon. To me this makes much more sense 
than the dual format system on the 1D MkIV, as it means only one memory card 
format needs to be carried.<br>
<br>
 Due to Nikon's line of battery grips, 
which are compatible with the same EN-EL4a battery, the battery cover comes 
separate to the battery block and needs to be removed when changing batteries 
(unless you purchase spares). Although not a major issue, I can see times where 
a battery may need to be changed in a hurry, or in the dark, that may make this 
a problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nikon D3S connections for USB, HDMI, microphone, AV 
out and a socket for mains power. A connection for a remote release and a PC 
flash socket are located on the front. Two Compactflash card slots can be 
configured to store images concurrently, or simultaneously so that one card is 
effectively a backup. They can also be configured so that one card receives Raw 
files, whilst the other receives JPEG images, or videos. <br>
<br>
A wide 
viewfinder eyepiece is very easy to use when wearing spectacles, and the 
dioptre adjustment is located on the side of the prism. Changing the 2500mAh 
EN-EL4a battery can be a bit fiddly, as the weather sealed clip has to be 
detached. Luckily the battery lasts an age on each charge. <br>

<strong> Viewfinder
</strong> <br>
 The viewfinder eyepiece on the Canon protrudes quite a distance 
from the body, which reduces the chance of pressing controls with your face or 
nose, especially if you are a left-eye shooter. AF points are illuminated 
bright red when activated and disappear almost completely from view when not in 
use, providing a clear view for composition. The viewfinder is bright, clear 
and quite large, making it easy to confirm focus, even in low light.<br>
<br>
 
On the D3S the viewfinder eyepiece doesn't protrude from the body as far as the 
Canon, and so may not be as comfortable for left-eye shooters to use, 
especially as the multi selector and AE-L buttons are just to the right of the 
viewfinder. Af points also light up red on this camera, but are not as bright 
as those on the Canon, and are much smaller in the viewfinder, which can 
sometimes make them difficult to see by comparison. The viewfinder 
magnification is slightly less than that of the Canon, so the viewfinder 
appears roughly the same size, even thought the sensor is larger.<br>
<br>
 
Both manufacturers have adopted a similar approach to the layout of 
information, which works well in both cases. Canon have also added battery 
information and what file format is being recorded, which can be useful to save 
shooting everything in JPEG when you meant to shoot Raw files. Both viewfinders 
have a counter showing how many shots remain in the buffer, which is especially 
useful given the high frame rates of both cameras.<br>
<br>
Canon EOS 1D MkIV 
Nikon D3S <br>
<br>
A bright, clear viewfinder with clear information and 
focusing points graces the EOS 1D MkIV. Information on the D3S viewfinder is 
also clearly displayed, although the AF points can be a little more difficult 
to see and there is no battery or file format information. <br>
<br>
<br>
 As 
far as handling is concerned, both cameras feel excellent to use and are built 
to exceptionally high standards. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses. 
The viewfinder display is more pleasant to use on the Canon, as the more simple 
battery design, but for me, the dual memory card formats and placement of the 
joystick controller let it down somewhat. It is virtually impossible to 
separate these two cameras, but the Canon just edges it in this department for 
me due to the viewfinder. The information is clearer and the AF points are 
easier to see and select.<br>
<br>

<h2>Canon EOS 1D MkIV vs Nikon D3S: Performance</h2> Both cameras were put 
through their paces in a variety of conditions and all images were taken in RAW 
+ JPEG for comparison.<br>
<br>
<strong>Exposure</strong> <br>
<br>
 For 
evaluating exposures, the 1D MkIV comes equipped with a 63-zone meter, which 
uses the selected AF point in its exposure calculation. Partial and spot 
metering modes are also available and the spot metering can be configured in a 
number of ways. It can either be fixed to the centre, or it can follow the AF 
point selected. The working range of this meter is 0-20 EV at 23 degrees with a 
50mm f/1.4 lens, which should ensure good performance in low light conditions.
<br> <br>
 Overall the Canon's evaluative metering work well, producing 
balanced exposures in a wide range of conditions. In harshly backlit conditions 
the meter works particularly well for an evaluative system, as it gives 
preference to the area focused on. Spot metering also performs well in either 
setup, although my personal preference is to have it follow the AF point. Quick 
exposure compensation adjustments can be applied in either shutter or aperture 
priority modes by turning the rear dial, which is excellent for shooting under 
rapidly changing conditions.<br>
<br>
 Nikon's 1005-pixel colour Matrix meter 
uses colour information as well as the focus point selected to ensure accurate 
exposures. It really shows its worth when shooting brightly coloured objects, 
which may lead to overexposure on traditional luminance based metering systems. 
Unfortunately in the Matrix meter seem less able to cope with harsh back 
lighting than Canon's metering system, which can result in your subject 
becoming silhouetted if appropriate compensation isn't applied. Easy exposure 
compensation can be enabled in the menu, allowing quick adjustment s to be made 
in aperture and shutter priority modes.<br>
<br>
 Spot and centre weighted 
modes are also available. By default, the spot metering area follows the AF 
point selected, which is especially useful in high contrast situations.<br>
<br>
 Both cameras have an Auto ISO facility, although their implementation differs 
somewhat. Canon's Auto ISO is very simple, providing a shutter speed that is 
safe for hand-holding the camera where possible in aperture priority and 
program modes, and the give the correctly metered exposure in shutter priority 
and manual modes. Nikon's Auto ISO feature is a little more advanced. For 
example, in aperture priority mode you can set an ideal shutter speed value and 
maximum ISO, and the camera will vary the sensitivity to achieve this where 
possible. When it is not possible to achieve the correct exposure with the 
parameters applied, then it will drop or raise the shutter speed to achieve the 
correct exposure. To me, this is a better system, as it prevents the camera 
from hiking the ISO to ridiculous levels suddenly, giving you a nasty noisy 
shock when you inspect your pictures later on. Virtually the same level of 
control can be achieved with the Canon by limiting the ISO range in the custom 
functions, but it is a poor workaround that is not nearly as intuitive as the 
Nikon solution.<br>
<br>
Canon EOS 1D MkIV Nikon D3S <br>
<br>
Scenes with high 
contrast subjects tend to retain good detail in the highlights, at the expense 
of detail in the shadows with the Canon. In these kinds of scenarios, where the 
subject isn't backlit, the Nikon tends to expose a little brighter, keeping 
more detail in the shadows. <br>
<br>
A top shutter speed of 1/8000 will freeze 
even the fastest motion. The same 1/8000sec top shutter speed is matched by the 
D3S. <br>
<br>
Evaluative metering does a decent job of keeping reasonable 
detail in this strongly backlit subject. The colour matrix metering system opts 
to retain more detail in the highlights in this scenario, almost silhouetting 
the subject. <br>
<br>
<br>
Evaluative metering is flawless in evenly lit 
scenarios. Even lighting is also dealt with very well by Nikon's colour Matrix 
metering. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Again this is another close call, and although the 
Canon's evaluative meter gives more satisfactory results in harshly backlit 
conditions, Nikon's implementation of Auto ISO wins it for me. It is a really 
useful feature, especially when shooting in rapidly changing lighting 
conditions.<br>
<br>
<strong>Focusing</strong> <br>
<br>
 To test the 
effectiveness of each camera's subject tracking in continuous autofocus mode I 
fired bursts of shots focusing on a bus approaching at approximately 30 miles 
per hour.<br>
<br>
 In this test the 1D MkIV performed especially well. Not one 
frame is out of focus from a burst of 17 shots. Even as the bus came close, it 
still managed to track focus adequately.<br>
<br>
 Although the D3S performed 
well, it didn't manage to get every shot in as sharp focus as the Canon. Some 
of the shots, especially those taken as the bus got closer are slightly behind 
the target.<br>
<br>
Canon EOS 1D MkIV Nikon D3S <br>
<br>
The Canon does a 
decent job of keeping up with the moving bus, even when it gets close. The 
Nikon gets most images in focus, but occasionally one or two are behind the 
target, especially as the bus gets close. <br>
<br>
<strong><br>
 Noise</strong>
<br> To evaluate the ISO capabilities of each camera's images were first taken 
on a tripod at each ISO setting under low light conditions, than each camera 
was taken to a dimly lit bar where shots of a live music performance were taken 
at ISO sensitivities of ISO400 and greater. This second set of images were also 
processed using default noise reduction setting in Capture One 6 to see if the 
Raw files have any more usable at very high ISOs.<br>
<br>
 Starting with the 
Canon, in the first test images up to ISO800 show no significant signs of 
noise, or softening due to noise reduction. At ISO1600 a little luminance noise 
is visible if you look closely, but the image quality is still very good here. 
From here onwards the levels of noise gradually start to increase, with a 
noticeable amount of luminance noise being present at 100% in images taken at 
ISO3200 and fine details being softened slightly as a result.<br>
<br>
 Things 
start to get a little snowy at ISO12800, and here levels of chroma noise have 
also started to increase and fine details are visibly softened. Pushing the 
sensitivity beyond the camera's native range results in visibly higher levels 
of noise and loss of fine detail, although shots taken at ISO25600 still keep 
chroma noise to levels which aren't too disturbing, which is excellent 
performance for such a high ISO and images at this setting should be fine for 
reproduction in less critical applications, such as for the web, or at small 
sizes in newspapers or magazines. At the H2 and H3 settings, colour noise 
starts to become an issue and much of the fine detail is lost. At H3 the amount 
of colour noise present is visible even at small sizes so this setting is 
probably best avoided unless you have no choice.<br>
<br>
 With the D3S, no 
significant signs of noise are present until ISO3200, which is quite amazing 
performance as well as being around a stop better than the EOS 1D MkIV. Here a 
slight amount of luminance noise can be seen if images are inspected closely at 
100%, but contrast and detail levels are still good. Detail. Remains good at 
ISO6400, even though there is more luminance noise present. Turning the ISO up 
a notch to ISO12800 results in a light amount of softening due to noise 
reduction, but detail and contrast still remain good for reproduction at decent 
sizes in print.<br>
<br>
 Pushing the camera beyond its native sensitivity 
range results in visible softening and loss of colour saturation due to the 
noise reduction making every attempt to control chroma noise levels. At 
ISO25600, images are acceptable for small print reproduction and the web, as 
are images taken at ISO51200, although they are beginning to look much much 
snowy at this setting. Hi-&pound;, which is equivalent to ISO102400 is probably 
best kept as a last resort as most fine detail has been obliterated by noise. 
Still edges are well enough defined and chroma noise levels are low enough to 
get away with small reproduction sizes on the web.<br>

 In the images from the ID MkIV 
the samples below processed in Capture One do retain slightly more detail, but 
also display much higher levels of chroma noise. Areas that are in focus are 
clearly defined enough at ISO12800 for acceptable reproduction in print.<br>

<br> Raw files from the D3S hold more detail than JPEGs straight from the 
camera up to ISO25600. In focus areas are more clearly defined whilst levels of 
chroma noise seem to be kept to reasonable levels.<br>

If shooting at really high ISO settings is important to you, the Nikon D3S is a 
clear winner here. That's not to say the Canon performs badly. It does perform 
very well in fact. Image up to ISO12800 will do for many forms of reproduction. 
With the Nikon images taken at this setting clearly contain more detail and 
less noise, especially if processed from a Raw file.<br>
<br>
<strong>Image 
Quality</strong> <br>
<br>
 Both cameras produce images of excellent quality in 
decent conditions, with images straight from the Canon having a more vivid 
appearance when the standard picture style is used. The colours produced by the 
Nikon are more muted by comparison but plenty of controls are provided if you 
require a more vivid look.<br>
<br>
 As far as preset styles are concerned, the 
1D MkIV has more to choose from, but both cameras have three customisable 
settings that can be tailored to your requirements.<br>
<br>
 Both cameras can 
capture impressive levels of dynamic range, but the greater detail can be seen 
in the highlights of images taken with the D3S, especially in Raw files from 
the camera, where even more detail can be retrieved using highlight recovery. 
Also due to the exceptionally low noise levels, more details can be retrieved 
from shadow areas also.<br>
<br>
Canon EOS 1D MkIV Nikon D3S <br>
<br>
Colours 
are vibrant, without looking unnatural in the standard picture mode. The D3S 
renders colours less vividly in the standard picture mode. Plenty of controls 
are provided if you require more punchy colours. <br>
<br>
Subtle tones are 
rendered well and dynamic range is decent. There is an amazing amount of 
dynamic range in files from the Nikon D3S, especially at lower ISO 
sensitivities. <br>
<br>
Fine details are clearly delineated in files from the 
Canon. Although the Nikon sports fewer pixels, images are still clear, sharp 
and packed with detail. <br>
<br>
Saturated primary colours are rendered well 
and good detail is retained in the highlights. Saturated primary colours 
captured by the D3S look subdued when compared to the Canon when both using the 
standard picture style. <br>

<strong>Sharpness and Detail
</strong> <br>
<br>
 Both cameras produce images with very good levels of 
detail straight from the camera, and the Raw files from both cameras contain 
ever so slightly more, especially in the highlights.<br>
<br>
 The images below 
were taken using the Raw+JPEG setting and the Raw files were processed in 
Capture one 6 using default settings.<br>

<br>
 The image quality from each 
camera is very good, and although the Canon has a higher pixel count, the 
amount of extra detail isn't great enough to offset the benefits of the wider 
dynamic range displayed by the D3S.<br>
<br>
<strong>White Balance</strong> <br>
<br> In daylight both cameras produce similar neutral results using the auto 
white balance setting. Under incandescent lighting both cameras display quite a 
strong colour cast with the auto setting, although the pink cast of the image 
taken with the Canon is slightly more disturbing than the amber cast present in 
the images from the D3S. Strangely the same mild magenta cast is present in 
images taken with the Canon under incandescent light using the incandescent 
preset too. The amber cast present in the image taken with the Nikon is still 
there too, although it is milder than that present in the image taken with auto 
white balance. Taking a custom white balance reading from the white background 
in the photograph, the Canon still displays a magenta cast, whilst the image 
taken with the Nikon is neutral, just like the image taken in daylight.<br>

<h2>Canon EOS 1D MkIV vs Nikon D3S: Verdict</h2> Separating these two cameras 
is a really tough call to make. Both are capable of producing superb quality 
images in the right hands, both are superbly built and both handle really well.
<br> <br>
 I really like the way the EOS 1D MkIV handles, especially the 
viewfinder information and autofocus, which are both superb. The image quality 
produced by it is also superb, with vibrant punchy colours and low noise 
compared to many other cameras available today. Good as it is though, when it 
comes to image quality factors such as noise at high sensitivities and dynamic 
range, it falls short when compared to the Nikon D3S.<br>
<br>
 For a 
professional, for who these camera are aimed at, it's the final result that 
counts. Having the ability to take images of acceptable quality at such high 
sensitivities could mean the difference between an image sale, or as Anne 
Robinson would say, leaving with nothing. For that reason above all else, the 
Nikon D3S would be my choice of the two cameras if I was starting from scratch. 
If however, you have a large investment in lenses, the difference isn't so 
great that it would be worth ditching the lot.<br>
<br>

<strong>The Canon 
EOS 1D MkIV makes a compelling argument for itself, and offers exceptional 
performance.</strong> <strong>The Nikon D3s offers class leading performance at

<p>Interesting from an academic point of view for me. I have used Nikon for 
many years but have never owned a professional Nikon (apart from a second hand 
F4S).<br>
<br>
 Only full time pros would consider a change of brand, or 
perhaps use both anyway.</p> <br>

<p>I agree with the conclusion, love the D3s, but just wanted to note there 
actually is a big advantage to having both a CompactFlash and SD card on the 
Canon. The Eye-Fi card, which is currently the most convenient way to 
immediately get photos onto the Internet from an SLR, is SD-only, so having 
both types of slots gives you the speed of top-of-the-line CompactFlash, while 
having the Eye-Fi card in slot 2 uploading photos, this is not possible on the 
D3s.<br>
<br>
 So, I would count CF and SD slots as a &quot;Pro&quot;, not a 
&quot;Con&quot;, and the lack of an SD slot is the primary reason I'm using a 
D7000 right now instead of the D3s.</p> <br>

<p>One additional issue, in your specifications comparison you say the Nikon 
D3s can take CompactFlash Type I and II cards, &quot;CompactFlash I and II, 
dual slot&quot;. I'm pretty sure this is not true, the D3s supports CF type I 
only, you can verify this on the official Nikon web site. The reason this is a 
big deal is that it means CompactFlash to SD adapters will not fit in the D3s, 
meaning the Eye-Fi card will not fit, so the only way to wirelessly transfer 
photos from the D3s is with the official Nikon wireless peripheral.</p> <br>

<p>Nit picking maybe but it would be nice to know which lens was used for the 
AF test.<br>
 More interesting is did the white line between lower and upper 
deck of the double decker bus in the Canon result present a better AF target 
than the single decker bus used in the Nikon test?<br>
 There are large dark 
areas of the front of each bus - dark areas are not the best AF targets.<br>
 
Using a double decker bus for each sequence would have eliminated a possible 
apples and oranges aspect.</p> <br>

Indeed, that is a good point. Both 
manufacturers offer dedicated WiFi transmitters so it isn't like the Nikon 
would lack the ability to transmit via Wifi, just the solution might be a bit 
bulkier and more expensive.<br>

I 
actually repeated the AF test with both cameras several times on various buses, 
and used the example where the camera performed best in an attempt to eliminate 
user error. To be fair the biggest issue I had was waiting for the buses. Of 
course after a while three would suddenly appear all at once</p> <br>

<p>Pitching a full frame camera with a mid range lens against a crop frame 
camera with a pro lens ( according to your pics ) if this is true then the test 
results are barking , the performance of the 50mm 1.2L lens should leave 
everything standing ? Can we have the specs of the lenses used to fairly judge 
this review ?<br>
<br>
 In realistic terms the 1dsmk4 if and when would be the 
comparison to the d3 or the 1ds3 ?<br>
<br>
 This seems once again like going

Having tested both the lenses, they give 
very similar performance when stopped down beyond f/2, so no shots were taken 
during the test at apertures wider than f/2.<br>
<br>
 Nikon don't do a wider 
aperture 50mm. Their f/1.4 optic is their top pro lens It would've been nice to 
have the newer f/1.4 available for the Nikon,but, for practical reasons, this 
wasn't possible. Again, when stopped down to f/2 and beyond, the older lens and 
the newer one give similar performance. The older one actually focuses a little 
faster<br>

 this has me wondering , can a 
&pound;300 nikon 1.4 lens really be producing the same fantastic results as my 
canon 50mm f1.2L which cost over &pound;1100 ,and what is nikons idea of a pro 
lens , having seem the nikon 1.4 of a D700 it looks fairly small and plasticky 
is it even weather sealed ? , more akin to the the canon 50mm 1.4 which is more 
likely its competitor ?</p> <br>

<br>
Not at f/1.2 no. That's why the Canon lens exists. Most 
lenses will give good optical performance when stopped down. You choose the 
right lens for the job in the end.<br>
<br>
 If you need to shoot at f/1.2 then 
&pound;1100 is what you need to pay, however, if such shallow DOF isn't 
required, say if you generally shoot between f/2.8 and f/5.6 all the time, 
you'll barely notice a difference as far as sharpness is concerned.<br>
<br>
 
For the purpose of this test, it matters not one jot if that lens is weather 
sealed or not.<br>
<br>
 You'd probably have a fit if you saw the battered old 
lenses I work with, but the results I get will probably be quite difficult to 
differentiate from those taken with the latest whizz-bang lenses from Nikon or 
Canon, or anyone else.</p> <br>

<p>id say both cameras are as good as each other and nothing to chose from 
them,<br>
 the only thing i notice is the last photo of the canal is the Canon 
photo is better than the Nikon, when its enlarge to maximum size you can read 
the plaque on the wall near the gas bottles on the Canon photo, but with the 
Nikon its burled this may be down to the lens that been used?</p> <br>

<p>Canon vs. Nikon. A very comprehensive review. IMHO it comes down to the 
bucks. The more you pay, the more you get, generally. Quality and capability 
can be bought. That being said, within the same price range, either brand can 
produce fantastic photos. In my view, &quot;it ain't the box.&quot;</p> <br>

<p>I have a Nikon D3 with a good selection/range of Nikon lens' and am very 
pleased with the equipment.<br>
 In the event the test turned out in favour of 
the Canon 1D it would not make the slightest bit in making me think I should 
have chosen Canon instead. The hype this debate creates does make me smile.<br>

<p>Well done for comparing all those technical specs - it does make choosing 
between camera bodies a lot less of a chore. At the end of the day these are 
just bodies. It all pales into insignificance beside the really important 
question - who does the best lenses?</p> <br>

<p>have to say that i find the idea that Canon can and Nikon cannot track on 
oncoming bus a little bizarre.. and actually would have preferred to see the 
test carried out on perhaps a peregrine. i have only skip-read this but there 
does not seem to be any reference to what i believe is Nikon's unique 'active

The Nikon did track the bus, just not 
as well. When it was being photographed, the bus was as close as a few feet 
from me, travelling at around 30mph. I used a bus, because they're more regular 
than Peregrines, believe it or not Also the peregrine would've had to be very 
close, as each camera was fitted with a 50mm lens.<br>
<br>
 Canon also have 
their Auto Lighting Optimiser, which does a very similar job to the Nikon's 
D-Lighting Feature. If I'd compared/mentioned every single feature, this 
article would've been an epic, rather than a review.</p> <br>

Quote: I agree with the conclusion, love the D3s, but just wanted to 
note there actually is a big advantage to having both a CompactFlash and SD 
card on the Canon. The Eye-Fi card, which is currently the most convenient way 
to immediately get photos onto the Internet from an SLR, is SD-only, so having 
both types of slots gives you the speed of top-of-the-line CompactFlash, while 
having the Eye-Fi card in slot 2 uploading photos, this is not possible on the 
D3s.<br>
<br>
 So, I would count CF and SD slots as a &quot;Pro&quot;, not a 
&quot;Con&quot;, and the lack of an SD slot is the primary reason I'm using a 
D7000 right now instead of the D3s.<br>
<br>
Would you really be using images 
taken on a D3s or 1D and directly images to the internet? No post processing, 
no resizing, no watermarks just immediate upload?<br>
<br>
 Just my view</p>

<br>
Two things, to answer the quote first 
though, There are multiple reasons to use the wifi card in the Canon or the 
attachments in either; I have a cloud repository on the web and by sending my 
photos to the cloud as they are taken, I can be sure the photos are available 
when I get home. If I lose or drop the camera, I still have the photos. Doesn't 
matter whether they are processed or not. I can d/l them from the cloud to my 
computer and then process, returning them to the cloud when processed to 
preserve them. Another reason to use wifi is that I have a notebook with wifi 
and Bluetooth. I could transmit the photos to the laptop to preserve them and 
also to process some in the field if I so desired. The purchase of an SD card 
is much less expensive then the manufacturer's attachment to do the same.<br>

<br> The other thing is the differences in the two cameras. I sold cameras 
years ago and tested both the Canon and the Nikon cameras 0f that time. I 
couldn't find enough difference in the cameras to be worth worrying about. Some 
of the Canon lenses were better than the same Nikon lenses and vice versa. I 
bought the Canon at that time as I got a better deal from the owner of the shop 
than I could get on the Nikon. Thus I have used Canon ever since and would not 
change at this time . I also use lenses from other manufacturers as I've found 
that their lenses are as good for my use as either the Canon or Nikon lenses. 
At present I'm using a Ukranian 16mm f2.8 lens and find it makes excellent pix. 
Enough so that I blow up my photos to as large as 13X19 and sell them as art 
photos, mostly sunsets and cloudscapes. I think everyone is too impressed by 
the names, Canon &amp; Nikon, to look objectively into other name lenses. Who 
cares how sharp a lens is at f1.2 if all you shoot is landscapes or races or 
sports events or even most news events. MY most expensive lens is $300.00- 75 - 
300 mm/f3.5 lens &amp; I've used it to shoot hawks on the wing as well as other 
birds in flight as well as other animals, kids running about, etc, etc. I once 
had an f1.2-75mm lens for a Canon rangefinder when I was shooting low light in 
clubs, bars, theaters, etc. I also used Kodak 2475 high speed recording film at 
4000 ASA for those shoots. I did get excellent photos with the rig, blowing 
some up to 30X40&quot; size for exhibits. It ain't the box, as someone above 
said, it is the user who makes the difference. I use a Canon EOS 350 now for my 
photos and the only change I'd ever make in it is full frame but I'm not 
willing to pay for the larger size camera.<br>

<p>One comment in how the tests were shot: I find it very disconcerting trying 
to compare the photos taken, as it were, with apparently different focal 
lengths in the two cameras. I feel that for a fair test, the Nikon should have 
been fitted with a 75mm or 80mm lens so that then sizes of the taken images 
were about the same. I think this is comparing apples to lemons. I'd like to 
see at least portions of the test done with equivalent focal length lenses. 
Either change the Nikon to the longer length or the Canon to a 35mm lens. This 
at least fills the &quot;film&quot; area with about the same amount of the 
subject.<br>

Quote: this has me wondering , can a &pound;300 nikon 1.4 lens really 
be producing the same fantastic results as my canon 50mm f1.2L which cost over 
&pound;1100<br>
<br>
 Not at f/1.2 no. That's why the Canon lens exists. Most 
lenses will give good optical performance when stopped down. You choose the 
right lens for the job in the end.<br>
<br>
 If you need to shoot at f/1.2 then 
&pound;1100 is what you need to pay, however, if such shallow DOF isn't 
required, say if you generally shoot between f/2.8 and f/5.6 all the time, 
you'll barely notice a difference as far as sharpness is concerned.<br>
<br>
 
For the purpose of this test, it matters not one jot if that lens is weather 
sealed or not.<br>
<br>
 You'd probably have a fit if you saw the battered old 
lenses I work with, but the results I get will probably be quite difficult to 
differentiate from those taken with the latest whizz-bang lenses from Nikon or 
Canon, or anyone else.<br>
<br>
Youre not the only one to have experience with 
old lenses , coming from a pentax background I have experience of some of the 
BEST primes ever made , and can happily say the canon 50mm 1.2 walks all over 
them in terms of character and build and pure natural shots at 1.2 or 2.8 , you 
would certainly notice the difference in shots compared to other 2.8 lenses ...

<br>
 Use pretty much any other 
AFS lens, including zooms, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with my 
Nikon's focussing/tracking capability.<br>
<br>
 My advice to anyone 
contemplating buying a D3S who is worried by this test would be to try the 
camera with one of Nikon's f2.8 zooms such as the 24-70 and you will find it 
very effective at 50mm.</p> <br>

Don't get me

 Had not even 
heard of the Canon ALO so many many thanks, i will go and look that up. Not 
that i am likely to 'switch sides' but i was thinking that in that area perhaps 
Nikon had an edge.</p> <br>

That

to someone sat a t a computer speeding the shooting to editing process. I know 
fo a few people who work in this way at events.<br>

We didn't use the AF-S version. We used the AF-D

At the end of the day, it was a 
test of focus, so a moving subject was needed. With the time constraints 
imposed, this is about the best I could muster. For one, Sheffield isn't known 
for its birds of prey. there's an owl in the park nearby, but that's only 
active at night.</p> <br>

You should 
have taken beaters with you to chase the owl out of the park whenever you 
wanted to run your tests Of course you'd have to use some method of directing 
the owl to whence you desired him! Perhaps a bobby to direct traffic? I think, 
from long experience, that no matter what you say or how you carry out the 
testing, there is always going to be dispute of your results. The Nikon 
fanatics are going to say that &quot;this Nikon lens is much better than the 
Canon lens you used, why didn't you use that?&quot; &amp; the Canon users are 
going to make claims that the Canon is MUCH better than the NIkon in such and 
such a test, regardless what your tests show, or you didn't give the Canon a 
fair shake because you conducted the test in this manner rather than that. You 
are in a lose, lose situation. Probably anyone who does camera comparisons has 
a screw or two loose to even begin, because they are going to receive a lot of 
garbage over the results. Mayhap you should just stick to little know cameras 
like the Minolta VS Omega comparison? Any way, good job of work, I know it 
takes a lot of time to do this sort of thing. Keep it up, but next time use my 
lens instead of the one you did.<br>

<p>There's no difference really is there? They're both great cameras and it 
simply boils down to personal preference in where the buttons are located and 
how it feels it your hands! 1000's of pro's use Canon, 1000's use Nikon, try 
them both and go with what feels comfortable.</p> <br>

 Try this one Panasonic vs

 Panasonic don't advertise, so that blows your theory out

<p>The cameras are so similar and both great; they rule over each other in 
different areas but in such a slight amount I hardly think it would matter. In 
the end, I'd just go with the less-expensive one.</p> <br>
