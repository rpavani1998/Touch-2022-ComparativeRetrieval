<h1>Lomography Lets People Know That They Still Do Very Well With Film</h1> 
<p>by Chris Gampat on March 15, 2012</p> <br>

<p>It seems that I was wrong and AP was right: even though Kodak announced the 
death of Ektachrome and their slide films followed by an increase in prices, 
Lomography wants people to know that film is still alive and well. In a press 
release sent out today, they released some interesting statistics.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The above screenshot was taken from a press release I received from them 
today. If the statistics indeed totally accurate, then that&rsquo;s all quite 
impressive. In a world where Kodak and Fujifilm are both cutting back on film 
(with Ilford perhaps being the only other<em>major</em> brand still around), 
Lomography is selling film as easily the internet sells bacon to hipsters. With 
quite a few different films, it is mind boggling that the company is also 
pre-announcing that they have more film to come.</p> 
<p>As a personal customer of the company, I actually can agree that they do an 
excellent job with the development of their film. Scanning&hellip;that&rsquo;s 
another story.</p> 
<p>They&rsquo;re not the only ones that do well though. The Impossible Project 
alsodominates when it comes to the instant photo field; at least when one walks 
all around New York do they see those products in the hands of so many people.
</p> 
<p>Another key factor: Lomography partners with so many excellent retailers 
such as Urban Outfitters.</p> 
<p>In the end though; it&rsquo;s really quite nice to know that as a film 
shooter myself (Social Media Coordinator Gevonloves film; so does Copy Editor 
Julius; and News Editor Felix; and I&rsquo;m smitten with Portra after spending 
a while with it), there is someone out there trying to ensure that I can keep 
experimenting with it. I personally still don&rsquo;t think there is a thing in 
the world that can touch the quality of Medium Format black and white film:
especially with a Mamiya 7 II.</p> 
<p>You all should remember that World Pinhole Day is coming up soon too.</p>

<p>They have my business&hellip;so many people are quick to put Lomography 
down but their customer service is amazing and they love shelling out Piggies 
for the store! I recently bought 8 packages of various films&ndash;including a 
pack of Tungsten which retails for just under $25&ndash;for $30 including 
shipping because of the Piggies I accumulated. &nbsp;The community has lots of 
cool photos and is a pretty neat place to check out. Instead of bashing folks 
who sell film for stupid reasons, we should all be glad it&rsquo;s still around 
and support those who are keeping it alive! Thanks for sharing this release so 
hopefully more people will have one more outlet to get their film!</p> </li>
