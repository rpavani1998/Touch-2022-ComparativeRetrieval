Post subject: Whatever happened to Pentax?<br>
Archived from 
groups: rec&gt;photo&gt;digital&gt;slr-systems, others (more info?) <br>
<br>

<br>  Back in the '60s, '70s and even into the '80s Pentax was right up there 
with<br>
 Canon and Nikon. But, today, it seems like the company doesn't even 
get<br>
 honourable mention in the brand wars. What happened? <br>
<br>
 As for 
myself, the last few times I've gone to buy a camera, I was<br>
 purchasing a 
compact that both my wife and I would be using. She likes an<br>
 optical 
view-finder while I use the LCD. This more-or-less ruled out<br>
 Pentax, since 
I couldn't find a Pentax with an optical finder at any of the<br>
 local camera 
shops.<br>
<br>
 I still have an old Pentax P3 film SLR that shoots great 
shots, and I pull<br>
 it out every now and then. I can't think of any reason 
why the quality of<br>
 Pentax film cameras should not have carried over into 
the digital world.<br>
<br>
 What about the rest of you? Any ideas on why 
Pentax has sort of faded into<br>
 the background? <br>

<br> they haven't faded at all. they just released the k200d and k20d dslrs <br>
 and have others in the works. they're not as big as nikon or canon but<br>
 
they do offer a decent alternative.<br>

 Still around. <br>
<br>
 Their K-10D 
is one of the top rated DSLRs, and they've just announced a<br>
 K-20D @ 14Mpx 
- body about $1K.<br>
<br>
 And unlike Nikon and Canon Pentax DSLRs are 
backward compatible with ALL<br>
 of Pentax's legacy lenses; going all the way 
back to screw mount<br>
 (although somewhat grudgingly and with some 
limitations in functionality<br>
 - but you CAN use them). <br>

that's not entirely true. pentax dropped the coupler so non-a lenses<br>
 need 
an extra step to stop down and meter. however, it's a single<br>
 button to 
press and that's easier than with low end nikon; mid and high<br>
 end nikon 
meter normally. pentax sdm lenses won't work on earlier<br>
 cameras, such as 
the k100d. and then there's ricoh's k mount variant<br>
 where the lens mounts, 
but gets stuck on the camera and needs to be<br>
 surgically removed. so 
there's some issues with pentax too.<br>
<br>
 on nikon, just about every ai 
lens or later will mount and work, with<br>
 some limitations in functionality, 
just like pentax.<br>

Canon and Nikon are just better at developing and marketing new products.<br>
 
Pentax and Yashica are trying to come back, but that will be difficult.<br>

 Well, sort of. If my memory isn't too fuzzy, I think that they 
&quot;said&quot; they<br>
 were going to make the first SLR with spot metering 
-- the Spotmatic.<br>
 Pentax made a pre-production model according to its 
claims, but when it hit<br>
 production the spot sensoring turned out to be a 
couple of sensors that<br>
 really only read an average of the light in the 
viewfinder. I'm not sure if<br>
 they later modified the spotmatic to actually 
use spot metering, or whether<br>
 one of the other giants got it into 
production first.<br>

 I have a Spotmatic 
SPII -- still in good working order. It's a classic, but<br>
 in spite of the 
catchy name, it only measures some sort of center-weighted<br>
 average. Don't 
believe that the Spotmatic, or even its early 1980's<br>
 successors (like the 
ME Super that I also have) ever did any more than<br>
 that. On the other hand, 
film is a lot more tolerant of overexposure than<br>
 digital, so spot 
measuring for highlights was not as big a deal as it is<br>
 now... <br>

 I think the two things I like best about Pentax was that they used

 good glass in their lenses, and my big hands always seem to fit the 
controls<br>
 even though the body sizes have been quite small. <br>

 Yes, that 
is a classic.<br>
<br>
 I read something on the net a while back that Pentax 
wants to revive the<br>
 concept / name with a digital version. Have you heard 
anything about that?<br>

<br> Not sure about in the rest of the world, but their <br>
 distribution 
within Australia didn't move with the times,<br>
 and hence their availability 
was poorer than other brands.<br>
<br>
 They have also pretty much abandoned 
the serious pro market,<br>
 leaving that for Canon and Nikon. They are still a 
fairly<br>
 strong player in the advanced amateur category at #3 in DSLR <br>
 
(albeit a long way behind Canon and Nikon). In the compact<br>
 camera market 
they are just another one of the masses.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As for myself, the

 If an optical viewfinder is one of your requirements, 
you<br>
 will rule out pretty much everyone. Canon and Sony are the <br>
 only 
ones left with optical viewfinders in their P&amp;S<br>
 cameras, and even 
those two are reducing the number of<br>
 models with it. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I 
still have an old Pentax P3 film SLR that shoots great shots, and I pull <br>

&gt; it out every now and then. I can't think of any reason why the quality of 
<br> &gt; Pentax film cameras should not have carried over into the digital 
world. <br>
 The quality has continued over. Their DSLRs are considered <br>
 
by many to offer very good value for money. The new K200D<br>
 and K20D, just 
like their predecessors the K100D and K10D<br>
 both offer features that will 
cost a lot more to get in any<br>
 other brand. <br>
 The digital SLRs are also 
compatible with older lenses<br>
 (Although some limitations apply to lenses 
that don't have<br>
 the &quot;A&quot; setting). <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What about 
the rest of you? Any ideas on why Pentax has sort of faded into <br>
&gt; the 
background? <br>
 Because Pentax don't have the serious pro 35mm format <br>
 
digitals, that market has been left to Canon and Nikon. As a<br>
 result, these 
2 hold the vast majority of the market share.<br>
<br>
 Actually Nikon have 
only been a major player again in the<br>
 last couple of years - they almost 
became marginalised too -<br>
 the D40/D40x were the start of their clawback, 
helped by the<br>
 D200, and now with the D3/D300 they are well and truly back 
<br> in the game. <br>

<br> a pretty easy guess where that goes. <br>

&gt;&gt; And unlike Nikon and Canon 
Pentax DSLRs are backward compatible with ALL <br>
&gt;&gt; of Pentax's legacy 
lenses; going all the way back to screw mount <br>
&gt;&gt; (although somewhat 
grudgingly and with some limitations in functionality <br>
&gt;&gt; - but you 
CAN use them). <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; that's not entirely true. pentax dropped the 
coupler so non-a lenses <br>
&gt; need an extra step to stop down and meter. 
however, it's a single <br>
&gt; button to press and that's easier than with 
low end nikon; mid and high <br>
&gt; end nikon meter normally. pentax sdm 
lenses won't work on earlier <br>
&gt; cameras, such as the k100d. <br>
 They 
work, they won't autofocus. Which is the same situation<br>
 you will have with 
Nikon if you mount a non-AFS lens on a<br>
 D40/D40x. Which basically means 
most 3rd party lenses won't<br>
 deliver AF on these cameras. <br>
&gt;and then 
there's ricoh's k mount variant <br>
&gt; where the lens mounts, but gets stuck 
on the camera and needs to be <br>
&gt; surgically removed. so there's some 
issues with pentax too. <br>
 A Ricoh K-Mount isn't a pentax lens though. 
Although there<br>
 are some limitations with focus and metering, you can <br>
 
attach, and then take a photograph with all old Pentax K<br>
 mount lenses, or 
with a suitable adapter you can also use<br>
 thread, 645 and 67 lenses. If it 
is non-Pentax, but in K,<br>
 Thread, 645, or 67 mount, then it will most 
probably still<br>
 work. The Ricoh lenses can be modified and then will work 
<br> fine. Compare this scenario with Canon and Nikon, where not <br>
 even all 
the genuine lenses will work.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; on nikon, just about every ai 
lens or later will mount and work, with <br>
&gt; some limitations in 
functionality, just like pentax. <br>
 Yes, but if it is a non-AI lens, then on 
some cameras you<br>
 have no metering at all (at least pentax gives stop-down 
<br> metering), and on some models they won't fire at all. If it <br>
 is a 
non-AFS lens, which is a LOT, even current models, then<br>
 you will have no 
AF on some models.<br>

 Not only do 
they work... they will autofocus too!<br>
 The pentax DA* lenses have a double 
AF system.<br>
 On cameras that support it they will use SDM and on older 
cameras<br>
 they'll revert to the old screwdrive AF. <br>

&gt;&gt; Back in the 
'60s, '70s and even into the '80s Pentax was right up there <br>
&gt;&gt; with 
Canon and Nikon. But, today, it seems like the company doesn't even <br>

&gt;&gt; get honourable mention in the brand wars. What happened? <br>
&gt; Not 
sure about in the rest of the world, but their distribution within <br>
&gt; 
Australia didn't move with the times, and hence their availability was <br>

&gt; poorer than other brands. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They have also pretty much 
abandoned the serious pro market, leaving that <br>
&gt; for Canon and Nikon. 
They are still a fairly strong player in the advanced <br>
&gt; amateur 
category at #3 in DSLR (albeit a long way behind Canon and Nikon). <br>
&gt; In 
the compact camera market they are just another one of the masses. <br>
<br>
 
FWIW, Pentax is _the_ camera of choice for medium format film landscape<br>
 
photographers in Japan. They split the medium format film market with<br>
 
Mamiya, whose cameras are seen more as studio cameras. Interestingly, only<br>
 
one of the Pentax and Mamiya medium format film cameras has been<br>
 
discontinued. Yet. (My best bet is that most of the Mamiya cameras are, like<br>
 the Hasselblad 500 series, not being mfd, but are still being sold as new<br>
 
from stock. But Mamiya is still advertising (6645AFD, 7II, RB67(!!!), and<br>
 
RZ67) in the current magazines here.)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; What about the rest of 
you? Any ideas on why Pentax has sort of faded <br>
&gt;&gt; into the 
background? <br>
&gt; Because Pentax don't have the serious pro 35mm format 
digitals, that <br>
&gt; market has been left to Canon and Nikon. As a result, 
these 2 hold the <br>
&gt; vast majority of the market share. <br>
&gt; <br>

&gt; Actually Nikon have only been a major player again in the last couple of 
<br> &gt; years - they almost became marginalised too - the D40/D40x were the 
start <br>
&gt; of their clawback, helped by the D200, and now with the D3/D300 
they are <br>
&gt; well and truly back in the game. <br>
<br>
 Yep. <br>

Pentax W10 vs. W20 - Hi, did anyone have 
a chance to compare the Pentax W10 to the new W20? They look pretty similar to 
me, the extra 1 megapixel is not worth much to me. I would appreciate any input 
on the new magic imaging features: Anti-Blur, etc... Are they any good?...<br>

<br>Pentax *ist DS - <br>
<br>
Pentax K10D - hi, Ii have a nice collection of 
pentax screwmount lenses which I use with old manuel cameras. I would like to 
get a new digital camera and naturally think to get a Pentax. Does anybody know 
if my old lenses are compatible with K10 D? I have some lens....<br>
<br>
want 
to use MOV files from Pentax W10 - I'd like to be able to join my cam's MOV 
files into a single AVI file that I can edit. There are lots of programs out 
there purporting to do that but not one so far that works. Anyone find one that 
works? Wondering if the W10's quicktime movies are..<br>
<br>
Pentax Optio A10 
- Since my Canon SD100 went belly-up, am now looking at the Pentax Optio A10 8 
Megapixel camera. Will appreciate any comments from anyone who knows what they 
are talking about. Personal experience preferable! Thanks, Big John <br>
