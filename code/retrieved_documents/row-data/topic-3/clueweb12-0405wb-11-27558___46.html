 I am torn between both cameras. I like many of the features of 
the<br>
 Nikon D80 BUT: <br>
<br>
 The dust removal system of the Canon seems 
like a very important<br>
 feature. Just how much of a problem is dust if you 
change lenses<br>
 frequently? <br>
<br>
 Some prelim reviews claim that the 
Canon has a faster and more accurate<br>
 auto focus. Comments Please. <br>
<br>
 As for Nikon D80<br>
<br>
<br>
 Some say that the color is more of a mutes 
pastel and appears richer.<br>
<br>
<br>
 The D80 has the ability to turn on a 
grid helping out with composition<br>
 according to the rule of thirds. <br>
 
Anyone think this is more important to have over the long term than a<br>
 dust 
removal system?<br>
<br>
 Some say that Nikon and their lenses have somewhat 
better construction.<br>
 Comments Please <br>
<br>
 I guess the bottom line is 
how they feel in your hands. Is that the<br>
 most important criteria? <br>
<br>
<br> How does one decide or it may be a moot point in 2 years when the next <br>
 round of camera is shipped. I think that by then Nikon will wake up.<br>
<br>
 
However, they did have a 1/500 flash sync that they removed. I hate it<br>
 
when features are taken away on future cameras. <br>

 My 2c: (I'm a 
Nikon user, so I may be a bit biased, but I'll try to be<br>
 objective) <br>

<br>
 It's not much of a problem, 
honestly. I would love to have an automatic dust<br>
 removal system, but I've 
cleaned my D70 once in the two years I've owned it,<br>
 it was a 3 minute 
thing with the right tools. And I'm not a very versed<br>
 person in things 
small and fiddly.<br>
<br>
&gt; Some prelim reviews claim that the Canon has a 
faster and more accurate <br>
&gt; auto focus. Comments Please. <br>
<br>
 I 
can't really comment on that, other than that I'm happy with the autofocus<br>
 
on the D70 and the D200. It's sometimes (not always) also a function of the<br>

 lens, if you don't have AFS or USM lenses. I have the 18-70 kit lens which<br>

 has AFS, and it's quick and snappy on both cameras, whereas the old 70-300G<br>
 lens hunts for focus on D70, D200 and F100. I have to admit, though, that I<br>
 very much like the Nikon autofocus system in general.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 
As for Nikon D80 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Some say that the color is more 
of a mutes pastel and appears richer. <br>
<br>
 I haven't seen many pics from 
the D80 yet - I'm waiting for the full preview<br>
 on some websites. There 
have been threads in this ng which pointed to<br>
 galleries of sample pics. 
<br> <br>
&gt; The D80 has the ability to turn on a grid helping out with 
composition <br>
&gt; according to the rule of thirds. <br>
&gt; Anyone think 
this is more important to have over the long term than a dust <br>
&gt; removal 
system? <br>
<br>
 A dust removal system and a &quot;composition help&quot; are 
two fundamentally<br>
 different things. I absolutely love the on-demand grid 
lines, they help me a<br>
 lot to keep my photos straight. I think that's a 
very helpful feature, but<br>
 that's just me. Pro's may not need it, but I as 
an amateur certainly think I<br>
 do. <br>
<br>
&gt; Some say that Nikon and 
their lenses have somewhat better construction. <br>
&gt; Comments Please <br>

<br> I think, both Canon and Nikon make very rugged cameras in the &quot;higher 
<br> class&quot;, and both make cameras that are less well built, but still 
very good.<br>
 The Nikons tend to be a bit heavier and bulkier (IIRC), but 
this has never<br>
 been a problem for me. The D100 or F100 are built like 
tanks, the D70 would<br>
 have profited from a bit more environmental sealing. 
<br> <br>
&gt; I guess the bottom line is how they feel in your hands. Is that 
the most <br>
&gt; important criteria? <br>
<br>
 It may not be the most 
important, but it is VERY important, believe me.<br>
 Before I went the Nikon 
route (back in the film days), I tried to handle as<br>
 many camera brands as 
I could to make up my mind. It just so happened that<br>
 the Nikons tended to 
feel good in my hands, the controls were in all the<br>
 right places (with 
some exceptions, though nothing critical) and the weight<br>
 and bulk felt 
&quot;just right&quot; for me. That, in combination with all other<br>
 
considerations, was an important part in the decision making process.<br>
<br>

&gt; How does one decide or it may be a moot point in 2 years when the next <br>
&gt; round of camera is shipped. I think that by then Nikon will wake up. <br>

<br> If you always want the newest, bestest digital camera, you'll be spending 
<br> LOTS of money in the coming years. I've long been waiting for a camera like
<br> the D200, and I consider my getting the D70 a somewhat premature decision. 
<br> I'm not in a bad situation now, the D200 being my primary camera, with the 
<br> D70 as the backup body, should I need it. I think, pick the camera that 
<br> satisfies your requirements with respect to image quality, ease of use, 
<br> flexibility, handling etc. and then stick with it for as long as you can. 
<br> The photographer takes the pictures, not the camera. <br>
<br>
&gt; 
However, they did have a 1/500 flash sync that they removed. I hate it <br>

&gt; when features are taken away on future cameras. <br>
<br>
 So do I, but 
then cameras are aimed at a certain group of people (the<br>
 companies of 
course want these groups to be as large as possible). I guess<br>
 Nikon 
thought that for the intended audience, a flash sync speed of 1/250<br>
 would 
be enough.<br>
<br>
 I admit, not much useful information, but I hope it helps 
a bit.<br>
<br>

<br>
 Oops... you asked 
about lenses, not cameras.<br>
<br>
 I think, the &quot;mid-range&quot; lenses 
(from a price point of view) that both<br>
 manufacturers sell, are just great 
w.r.t. construction and quality. There<br>
 are dogs in EVERY camera system, 
but you tend to recognize these very<br>
 quickly once you handle them. As a 
general rule, get the best glass you can<br>
 afford! No point in (as I did... 
shame on me!) putting a Samyang 19-35 on a<br>
 F100 and then complaining about 
the lousy sharpness and the heavy flaring.<br>
 The importance of good glass 
cannot be understated.<br>

 I've watched dust

in a situation where the camera was sitting in<br>

several minutes after it was activated, maybe it<br>
 would work. Instead, it's 
activated when you turn the camera on, and<br>
 the camera is then moved

 True for

 Nikon and Canon, 
depending) make some really good lenses, and some<br>
 not-so-good lenses. <br>

 Not most important, but 
important, yes. Certainly in the list of<br>
 things to give major 
consideration to.<br>

&gt; <br>

 You either buy now, or later. 
<br> If you buy now, you get the benefit of what you buy. If you buy later, <br>
 you get the benefit of nothing until later.<br>
 Seems simple. <br>
 There are 
those who will always wait for 'the next better thing.&quot; They<br>
 miss 
out, in the hope that they will get their reward later.<br>

To answer the questiuon Re: is dust much of a problem? That's been<br>

 I've had two DSLRs, and neither has had a 
dust problem yet. In<br>
 Phoenix, which is dusty, but I haven't been on a

 either. <br>
 Will the dust shaker work? My observations 
of dust say no, it won't.<br>
 Dust doesn't fall neatly down, to stick to a

 What's to keep it from sticking to the sensor,

 I've had 2 DSLRs now, and I 
don't have a dust problem, so it's not<br>
 needed. That's as legit as anything

 So, it's ultrasonic; how does that mean it 
works?<br>
 Are there any studies that actually show it works? <br>
 Mercedes

 And how is 
this pertinent? Windshields aren't in the same sort of<br>
 environlemt as a 
sensor in a DSLR. I can use the windshield washer to<br>
 clean my windshield; 
I suppose the 8D will have a sensor washer. <br>

 Not a big problem. It 
is highly questionable whether Canon's system is<br>
 even slightly more 
effective than a bulb blower.<br>
<br>
&gt; Some prelim reviews claim that the 
Canon has a faster and more accurate <br>
&gt; auto focus. Comments Please. <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
 Few of us here have used both cameras, so it is hard to tell. 
Probably<br>
 not a lot of difference. <br>
<br>
&gt; As for Nikon D80 <br>
&gt;
<br> &gt; <br>
&gt; Some say that the color is more of a mutes pastel and 
appears richer. <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
 My impression is that Canon cameras *by 
default* have more saturated<br>
 color. But both cameras have menu settings 
which affect that<br>
 considerably. You can produce a picture with Nikon that 
looks like a<br>
 Canon picture and vice versa. <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The 
D80 has the ability to turn on a grid helping out with composition <br>
&gt; 
according to the rule of thirds. <br>
<br>
 A nice feature, but not essential. 
I don't think it is any more<br>
 important than Canon's anti-dust feature. <br>
<br> &gt; Anyone think this is more important to have over the long term than a 
<br> &gt; dust removal system? <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Some say that Nikon and 
their lenses have somewhat better construction. <br>
&gt; Comments Please <br>

&gt; <br>
<br>
 Some say that. Some say otherwise. Reviewers seem to give Nikon 
lenses<br>
 the edge, but the differences are minor in any event. <br>
<br>

&gt; I guess the bottom line is how they feel in your hands. Is that the <br>

&gt; most important criteria? <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
 Without question, ergonomics 
is the most important feature. Both<br>
 cameras are highly dependent on menus 
to access important settings.<br>
 This is not good. The more you can do with 
an easily accessible dial or<br>
 button the better. <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 
How does one decide or it may be a moot point in 2 years when the next <br>

&gt; round of camera is shipped. I think that by then Nikon will wake up. <br>

&gt; <br>
<br>
 Actually, Nikon introduced the first practical digital SLR. 
Nikon has<br>
 been about six months ahead of Canon in the product development 
cycle<br>
 ever since. That is not a huge difference, but when Canon claims to 
be<br>
 more innovative, they are lying. No matter what camera you buy, a <br>
 
better one for less money will be available in six months. That is<br>
 tough. 
If you plan on waiting until no more significant improvements<br>
 are being 
made in digital cameras before buying one, you are going to<br>
 have a very 
long wait. You can be sure that replacements for the D80<br>
 and the XTI are 
already well into development and some protoypes may<br>
 already have been 
manufactured.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; However, they did have a 1/500 flash sync that 
they removed. I hate it <br>
&gt; when features are taken away on future 
cameras. <br>
<br>

 As I said, I've observed dust; 
it doesn't falll neatly down,<br>
 especially when the air it's in is 
disturbed. The shaking of the<br>
 sensor occurs when the camera is turned on, 
meaning it's probably in<br>
 motion, and the air will be disturbed by the 
camera's motion. It will<br>
 be disturbed more by the actuation of the shutter 
and mirror movement.<br>
 Why would loose dust go to the sticky strip? <br>
 It 
seems to me this is a gimmick, more or less forced on Canon by the<br>
 
&quot;popularity&quot; of the same gimmick in other cameras.<br>

 I guess it will remove a little bit (the bits 
that are at the bottom of<br>
 the sensor) each time it gets switched on. 
Bigger grains will obviously<br>
 drop down more readily. As for small stuff, 
it's statistics. By making<br>
 one surface vibrate you decerase the surface 
available for the dust.<br>
 Therefore the percentage of surface covered by the 
sticky strip increases.<br>
 Therefore the likelyhood of the dust hitting the 
sticky bit increases<br>
 too. <br>
<br>

 Eventually.<br>
 But then, new dust enters too. <br>
 And the sticky strip is 
smaller than the sensor, so the dust is more<br>
 likely to stick on the sensor 
than on the strip.<br>
 Overall, the dust removal system may mean a little less 
dust on the<br>
 sensor, but since dust isn't that big a problem in the first 
place for<br>
 most users... <br>
 I still think it's not needed, and not very 
usefull.<br>

Nikon D80 vs Canon 20d - 
Stupid I guess but I had to ask people more knowledgeable than me the pros and

better. ..<br>
