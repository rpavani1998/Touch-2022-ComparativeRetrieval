<h1>Didn't like the way Nikon D50 and Canon rebel/20 D felt</h1> topic posted

I decided I should get my hands on these bodies before I ordered the Rebel 
online, so I went down to Circuit City and Best Buy and just got a feel. I 
didn't like the way they felt, especially the lens on the Rebel and the 20D. 
Ironically, the Pentax (100D?) felt great. I really liked it. So, now I'm 
thinking I'll wait until the new Pentax comes out in July, but then I'm back to 
the problem of lenses again. I love the Tamron lens I have on my film Pentax. 
How hard is it going to be to find good lenses for the Pentax dSLR? Is the 
sensor in Pentax any good, does anyone know?<br>

 I believe the Pentax sensor is the Sony 6MP CCD 
but I may be wrong. I wouldn't worry about lenses. I believe Tamron makes 
theirs in a Pentax mount plus Pentax lenses have traditionally been very good.

(The feel of the camera is so important.) <br>

 Thanks Sean, I've had such a hard time making up 
my mind. Finally, I feel excited about it! join to post <br>

 how much money do u got to blow? the kit lens on 
the Canon 18-55mm suck big time...if u would reconsider the canon I would spend 
another 500 bucks and get 17-85mm and more compact flash cards at least 4GB and 
two extra spare batteries depending how whether or not you shoot raw. join to

 Oh, the lens sucked, no doubt. If I got the Rebel 
I would get the body only and buy a better lens but Sean's right it was the way 
the body felt in my hand. The Pentax just felt right somehow. I actually like 
the lens that was on the Pentax, too. join to post <br>

 I've heard that the Canon kit lens is actually 
pretty good. (I don't know; I'm a Nikon guy.)<br>
<br>
But a lot of the newer 
lenses don't &quot;feel good&quot; to old-timers since they're lighter-weight 
and<br>
have less friction in focusing so that auto-focus can work faster. I 
know that in the old days<br>
of pure manual-focus lenses, it was nice to have 
friction so you could smoothly make small<br>
adjustments. <br>
<br>
So all 
modern lenses may &quot;feel funny&quot;. But the key thing is how you like the 
camera and<br>
its controls, et cetera. It could be that you like the Pentax 
because its controls are similar<br>
to what you're used to on your old Pentax, 
and that's a very good reason to stick with the<br>
brand. join to post <br>

 The lens kit is actually quite OK. It is indeed 
light. Looks small and cheap, but will take very reasonable pictures.<br>
<br>

Of course, now that I have my 28-300 EF IS L lens, I very rarely use the kit 
lense, but when I want to travel extremely light, I still get the old kit 
lense, and remove the battery grip and get back to the 20D in it's small and 
light config.<br>
<br>
When I can travel heavier, or when I do a wedding, I 
have the battery grip with 2 batteries in it, the 28-300, and my trusty 
speedlight 580 flash on top. I really love my camera!<br>

<h2>How do you like the EF 28-300 IS L?</h2>  Thu, June 15, 2006 - 3:39 PM <br>
 I've read of it referred to as &quot;not really L quality&quot; and &quot;just 
a marketing gimmick&quot; but I have to say that I've recently started 
fantasising about this lens. It just seems SO flexible. I appreciate that a 10x 
zoom ain't gonna be as sharp as a prime, but I don't want it to be worse than 
the EF-S 17-85mm I have at the moment. What do you say?<br>

 Yes, the lens felt light and cheap. Thanks for 
the explanation, that makes a lot of sense. It definitely helps to understand 
why it felt so different. join to post <br>

 Sometimes &quot;light and cheap&quot; is a 
pretty reliable indicator of quality, but a great counter to that notion is 
Canon's ultra-light, ultra-cheap 50mm 1.8. Wafer-light and sells new for 'round 
$70-80 but surprisingly sturdy and optically impressive. join to post <br>

 Yes, both Canon 50mm's, the f/1.8 and the f/1.4 
are very nice optically, and they're reasonably tough. They're really nice on a 
20D, because they're effectively 80mm lens, which is pretty nice working 
distance and it's also for a wicked fast lens. Great for interiors, club, and 
stage lighting situations.<br>
<br>
In general, I find the L-series lenses 
focus FASTER than the 20D kit lens, despite any disparities in mass or 
friction. However, that 20D kit lens is really not terrible optically and it is 
light. This zoom demonstrated to me that Canon was serious about supporting the 
1.6X FOV form factor cameras via the EF-S lens line, where the image circle is 
set back farther toward the sensor into the camera. I think it may even be a 
sort of &quot;second-generation&quot; design, because if you look carefully at 
the 2X Teleconvertor II (say, for use with the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS), you see a 
very similar optical interfacing trick.<br>
<br>
I keep saying &quot;20D,&quot; 
but the EF-S mount of course applies to the new 30D and the RebelXT as well.

 I shot with a 20D for a couple of years before I 
bought a 5D and with both bodies I added the battery pack and a hand strap. The 
battery pack with strap makes the camera bigger and heavier but the camera is 
&quot;on my hand&quot; the entire time that I'm shooting and there's no grip 
change to move between horizontal and vertical positions. I find too, that with 
the battery pack/handstrap I'm able to hold the camera on my shoulder or at my 
side with ease whether I'm shooting in the studio or the field. join to post

<br>
If you're waiting 'til July, you may want 
to think about the new Sony.<br>
<br>
Yes, Sony. <br>
<br>
They've jumped into 
the Digital-SLR market in a rather impressive manner...<br>
