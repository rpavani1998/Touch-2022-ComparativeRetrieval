<h3>Best Canon cameras 2012</h3> 
<p>20th Jan 2012 | 16:13</p> 
<p> The full range of Canon's best DSLR and compact cameras </p> 
<h3>Best Canon DSLR cameras</h3> 
<p>Canon's name is synonymous with a plethora of the best cameras on the 
market. In the DSLR market it's the key player, and has outsold its nearest 
rivals for several years. Loyal customers help contribute to this success, yet 
Canon's world-class range of up-to-date products ensures there's always 
something worth coming back for.</p> 
<p>Although the company hasn't - at least as yet - announced a compact system 
camera (CSC), there are plenty of rumours that one will surface some time 
during 2012.</p> 
<p>So which Canon camera is best for you? We give you the lowdown on the Canon 
range of DSLRs and compact cameras.</p> 
<h4><strong>Best Canon DSLRs explained</strong></h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Canon EOS DSLR range encompasses three sensor sizes: APS-C, APS-H and 
full-frame (35mm).</p> 
<p>The Canon-produced APS-C format sensor can be found in the company's range 
of consumer cameras. However, its size differs from the Sony-made sensors found 
in Nikon and Pentax cameras. As such, these (ever so slightly) smaller-sensor 
Canon DSLR cameras have a 1.6xcrop factor.</p> 
<p>This means that on an APS-C format Canon camera a 100mm lens produces 
images similar to a 160mm on a full-frame camera, whereas 100mm on a 
Nikon/Sony/Pentax DSLR offers a 150mm equivalent.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Canon also makes a full-frame DSLR series that's a great option for 
professionals or serious amateurs. The 36 x 24mm sensor size - the same size as 
traditional 35mm film - is ideal for producing the utmost in image quality, and 
offers greater depth of field control than small sensors.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The APS-H sensor is a Canon-only venture. The 1.3x crop (ie a 100mm lens 
provides a 130mm equivalent) is roughly halfway between APS-C and full-frame 
sizes - it's this balance between final image quality and a smaller overall kit 
that makes it ideal for many on-the-go pros.</p> 
<p>In terms of lenses, all Canon DSLRs use the EF-mount. However, it comes in 
two flavours: the original EF and the more recent EF-S version. EF lenses are 
the pricier, often pro-spec lenses designed to produce an image circle large 
enough to cover a full-frame sensor or 35mm film. EF-S lenses are designed for 
the smaller-sensor APS-C format Canon DSLRs.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>EF-S lenses are designed to fit with a shorter distance between the lens's 
rear element and the compatible host camera's sensor than their EF equivalents. 
This means an image circle only large enough to cover APS-C sensors is produced.
</p> 
<p>But also, due to their design difference, mounting an EF-S lens on a 
larger-sensor Canon DSLR would result in damage, due to a clash between the 
camera's mirror and the rear lens element. This isn't applicable the other way 
around, so new photographers using a post-2003 Canon EOS DSLR with an APS-C 
sensor size needn't worry about compatibility.</p> 
<h3>Best Canon DSLR - APS-C and APS-H sensors</h3> 
<h4><strong>Best Canon DSLR - APS-C sensor</strong></h4> 
<h4><strong>Canon EOS 1100D</strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;310 (body only), 12MP, HD video: 720p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Canon's entry-level EOS 1100D, known as the Rebel T3 in the US, is designed 
with new photographers in mind. It's Canon's most affordable EOS DSLR by quite 
a margin, which makes it best for those on a budget who are looking to step 
into first-time DSLR use.</p> 
<p>A 12 megapixel APS-C sensor delivers decent images, whether using the full 
array of manual controls or the point-and-shoot Creative Auto mode.</p>

<h4><strong>Canon EOS 600D </strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;550 (body only), 18MP, HD video: 1080p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The 'middle ground' of Canon's consumer range, the EOS 600D (or T3i as it's 
known in the US) has a very similar 18MP sensor to the found in the higher-spec
60D and 7D models, which makes the 600D great value for money. </p> 
<p>Best for enthusiasts, families and creatives, one of the 600D's standout 
features is its 3-inch, 1040k-dot, vari-angle LCD screen. Not only is this 
display a higher resolution than you'll find on any competitor DSLR camera, but 
the ability to manoeuvre it into any given angle is a great feature to have.</p>

<h4><strong>Canon EOS 60D </strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;800 (body only), 18MP, HD video: 1080p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Canon EOS 60D is best for enthusiasts seeking a more rugged camera than 
the likes of the600D. Although the Canon website doesn't make as much of a song 
and dance about the 60D's body as it ought to, this is among the key reasons to 
buy this camera.</p> 
<p>Part sealed for protection against the elements, the 18MP EOS 60D is a step 
closer to a sturdy professional camera outfit.</p> 
<p>Read our Canon EOS 60D review</p> 
<h4><strong>Canon EOS 7D </strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;1,100 (body only), 18MP, HD video: 1080p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When the Canon EOS 7D was launched, it was touted as a camera 
&quot;designed by photographers for photographers&quot;. Its launch came prior 
to the 60D's announcement and, at the time, looked to be a potential 
replacement for the longer-running 60D series. Although the60D and 7D have a 
very similar 18MP APS-C sensor as in the 600D, the 7D's higher price and 
additional features such as full environmental sealing make it Canon's highest 
specified EOS DSLR with an APS-C sensor.</p> 
<p>A focusing system with 19 cross-type focus points mean the camera zips onto 
subjects in portrait or landscape orientation, and the 8fps continuous shooting 
mode is far quicker than the 60D's 5.3fps burst. The Canon EOS 7D is best for 
demanding amateurs, but is easily good enough to be used professionally.</p>

<h4><strong>Best Canon DSLR - APS-H sensor</strong></h4> 
<h4><strong>Canon EOS 1D Mark IV </strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;3,500 (body only), 16.1MP, HD video: 1080p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A great choice for professional sports and wildlife photographers, the 
Canon EOS 1D Mark IV's 1.3x crop factor gives EF lenses (EF-S lenses aren't 
compatible) that extra reach compared to the full-frame EOS models found 
further up the range. Add a 10fps burst mode and 45-point autofocus system with 
39 cross-type sensors and there's no doubting this is an exceptional camera for 
shooting moving subjects.</p> 
<p>The sheer level of customisation available is phenomenal - it's great for 
professional photographers who know exactly how they want to set up their 
focusing system's responsiveness.</p>

<h3>Best Canon DSLR - Full-frame sensor</h3> 
<h4><strong>Canon EOS 5D Mark II </strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;1,520 (body only), 21.1MP, HD video: 1080p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There's rumour that the Canon EOS 5D Mk II will be replaced in the not so 
distant future, since its 2008 launch makes it older than any other current EOS 
model. However, this has one big plus point - price! The Canon EOS 5D Mk II 
costs less than any other full-frame DSLR on the market, including theSony A850 
orNikon D700. </p> 
<p>So if you've always wanted to experience shooting with a full-frame camera 
then there's no better introduction than this superb camera. (Note, it takes EF 
lenses only, not EF-S).</p>

<h4><strong>Canon EOS 1DX </strong></h4> 
<p>Price: &pound;5,300 (body only), 18.1MP, HD video: 1080p</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The most recent Canon EOS announcement, the 1DX replaces both the 1Ds Mark 
III and 1D Mark IV cameras, and is due for release in March 2012. The 
introductory &pound;5,300 body-only price is far from cheap, but from what 
we've seen this is one special camera.</p> 
<p>The 18.1MP full-frame sensor can churn out images at 12fps (14fps in High 
Speed mode) and offers other mind-bending features such as extended sensitivity 
up to ISO 204,800 and a 61-point autofocus system. The Canon EOS 1DX is suited 
for us by professional photographers working in the studio, out in the field or 
a mix of both. A true workhorse. (Note: it takes EF lenses only, it's not EF-S 
compatible).</p>

<h3>Best Canon compact cameras</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>When it comes to compact cameras, there's a Canon model to suit all tastes. 
Divided into the IXUS and PowerShot ranges, the former is best for 
point-and-shoot use, while (generally speaking) the latter is best for more 
demanding users demanding higher-end features and in some case manual control.
</p> 
<p>However, it's not as clear-cut as that: some of the low-end PowerShot 
models are less significant than some IXUS models, plus a number of the latest 
high-end IXUS models offer manual controls and settings that blur the 
boundaries between the two ranges.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In the US, the IXUS range is known as the PowerShot Digital ELPH series - 
confirming that, in some cases, the camera's name won't always dictate its 
ability.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To find out which IXUS or PowerShot is best for you, read our Best Canon 
IXUS and Best Canon PowerShot articles.</p>
