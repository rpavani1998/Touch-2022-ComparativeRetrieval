<p>Nikon's D5100 DSLR camera</p> Nikon More Images (2) <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Despite the availability of a variety of&nbsp;DSLR&nbsp;manufacturers, 
the&nbsp;Canon&nbsp;versus&nbsp;Nikon&nbsp;debate is still going strong. Since 
the days of 35mm film, the two manufacturers have been close competitors. 
Traditionally, things seem to see-saw between the two, with each manufacturer 
becoming stronger for a while, before fading away to the other.</p> 
<p>If you're not tied into a system, the choice of cameras can seem 
bewildering.</p> 
<p>In this article, I'm going to take a look at the two manufacturers' 
mid-range consumer DSLR cameras: TheCanon T3i and the Nikon D5100.</p> 
<p>Which is the better buy? I'll take a look at the key points on each camera 
to help you make a more informed decision.</p> 
<h3>Resolution, Body and Controls</h3> 
<p>Canon's T3i has 18MP of resolution compared to Nikon's 16.2MP. It's 
unlikely, though, that you'll notice much difference in real world terms.</p> 
<p>Both cameras weigh almost the same, with the Canon weighing just 0.35 
ounces (10g) more. They're both sturdy little cameras, and they feel 
substantial. The Canon's hand grip is perhaps marginally easier to use, but 
both cameras have articulated LCD screens.</p> 
<p>When it comes to controls and ease of use, I feel that the Canon is still 
yards ahead of the Nikon. The T3i has a four-way controller (which is a little 
on the small side), giving access towhite balance, focus, drive modes, and 
picture styles. There's also a dedicated button forISO, something which the 
Nikon D5100 is lacking. Existing Nikon users will also be confused by the 
re-design of control layout on the D5100 due to the articulated LCD screen.</p> 
<p>The only place where the Canon falls down on controls is in the 
inexplicable change of functions&nbsp;of the 4-way controller once the camera 
is in Live View or Movie Mode. In these modes, the controller only allows for 
moving the AF-point around its nine points. This is confusing, to say the least!
</p> 
<h3>Autofocus and AF Points</h3> 
<p>Both cameras have solid and reliable autofocus, although the Nikon's speed 
is reliant on whatever lens you're using, as it has no in-body autofocus motor. 
However, the Nikon'sAF points are part of a far more sophisticated system than 
the Canon's. The D5100 has 11 points to the T3i's nine. But it also has four 
different modes for using the AF points, whereas the Canon only has two.</p> 
<h3>Image Quality</h3> 
<p>While both cameras produce great images, the D5100 is just a little bit 
better in most respects. The Canon produces excellent images in bothRAW and 
JPEG formats, and it copes very well at high ISOs, offering users the option to 
reduce noise to their own set trade-offs against image detail and quality. 
However, the T3i yet again has Canon's trademark problems in coping with 
artificial light when using auto white balance, as images are distinctly 
orange. The T3i is also more prone to chromatic aberration than the D5100.</p> 
<p>The Nikon also produces excellent images in both RAW and JPEG, and it does 
an even better job of keeping thenoise down at high ISOs. Best of all, it 
doesn't seem to share other DSLRs' tendencies to overexpose in high contrast 
situations. It also has better dynamic range and color depth than the Canon.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion</h3> 
<p>I personally find the layout and control system of the Nikon confusing and 
somewhat lacking in key areas. However, image quality is where it counts, so, 
if you're new to digital cameras, then the Nikon has the edge. Both cameras 
have their plus points though, and users are unlikely to be disappointed by 
either machine.&nbsp;</p> <br>
