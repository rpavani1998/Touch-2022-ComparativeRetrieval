<h1><em>Oh No! Not a Nikon / Canon Comparison ! </em></h1> 
<h2>Yes. I'm Afraid So </h2> 
<h6><br>

</h6> 
<p>Attendees of the Jay Maisel seminar at The Luminous Landscape Gallery 
watching a video slide show.<br>
 The illumination in the gallery was so low 
when this shot was taken that it was too low to read.</p> 
<h3>Background</h3> 
<p>Regular readers will have noted that I shoot primarily with Canon cameras 
and lenses.</p> 
<p>Why? Because I have to shoot with <em>something</em> &ndash; right? In 
about 1996 I switched from 30 years of shooting Nikon because I was attracted 
to lenses which Nikon didn't offer at the time, the Canon's T/S and IS lines.
</p> 
<p> I had few regrets at the switch through the first 7 years of this decade 
during the transition to digital, because it's my opinion that with its full 
frame sensors and superior high ISO noise capabilities Canon had a clear edge. 
Many other pros apparently thought so as well, and as a consequence Nikon lost 
some market share in this segment.</p> 
<p>But with the introduction of the D300 and D3 a few months ago, and the 
commencement of their shipping during the last week of November, '07, I now 
believe that Nikon is back in the game. For this reason I recently purchased a 
D300 and a few lenses to begin refamiliarizing myself with the current Nikon 
line, and mentioned this on What's New.</p> 
<p>As could be expected, a number of ill-mannered individuals with an apparent 
axe to grind started commenting on other discussion forums (<em>no guts to do 
so here, it would seem</em>) ascribing all sorts of motivations to this, most 
of them uncomplimentary if not downright rude and unkind.</p> 
<p>No rebuttal is warranted, but since words on the net last forever I will 
make the following comments, just to set the record straight. This site is 
designed to reflect my personal interests in photography, both the art and the 
craft. That means I write about the products and software that cross my desk, 
or which I personally own and use. But with some one million unique readers a 
month this site needs to reflect from time to time the interests of a broader 
constituency, and in this case I felt that my lack of Nikon coverage was doing 
a disservice to that segment of the community, especially pros for whom Nikon is
<em>their</em> tool of choice.</p> 
<p>So, this isn't about my needing more cameras, or switching from Canon to 
Nikon, (<em>which I'm not</em>), or having money burning a hole in my pocket. 
And lets not forget that by adding Nikon to the mix on a regular basis I'm 
increasing my work load, not to mention the confusion factor when working in 
the field.</p> 
<p>Rather, this move is intended to expand my abilities, coverage, and 
therefore audience. This obviously isn't about advertising, because the only 
ads on this site (<em>other than my own</em>) are from <em><strong>B&amp;H Photo
</strong></em>, and they'll happily sell you whatever brand you wish. They're 
platform agnostic. So those that think there's a commercial motivation to this 
are simply being malicious and are spouting uninformed nonsense.</p> 
<p> I just had to get that off my chest. End of preamble. </p>

<h3>Jay's Seminar</h3> 
<h6><br>
 Jay Maisel &ndash; Toronto, December, 2007 <br>
 ISO 1600 </h6> 
<p>Over the weekend of December 1 &ndash; 2, 2007, my friend and colleague Jay 
Maisel taught a seminar at my Toronto Gallery / Studio. I mention this because 
the day before he arrived in Toronto I took delivery of the<strong>Canon 1Ds 
MKIII</strong> that I had ordered after my Madagascar shoot, where I took some 
some 5,500 frames with a pre-production MKIIIs. And then, on the first day of 
the seminar, one of the attendees brought in his just acquired Nikon D3, among 
the first to be delivered in the US. Add 20 enthusiastic amateur and 
professional photographers, and what did you think everyone (<em>including me, 
a Canon shooter, and Jay, a Nikon shooter</em>) wanted to do? You got it. 
Compare the Nikon D3 and the Canon 1Ds MKIII, especially at high ISO, since the 
buzz about the new Nikon is its claimed very low noise capability at high ISO (
<em>up to ISO 25,600</em>).</p> 
<p>And so I did &ndash; different ISO's, different lenses, different subjects. 
Nothing terribly formal, but enough tests, with enough pairs of experienced 
eyes, both Canon and Nikon users, to come to some preliminary conclusions.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>ISO 1600</h3> 
<p>The photograph of Jay Maisel above isn't terribly flattering. The lighting 
in my gallery is designed to illuminate framed photographs, not for shooting 
portraits. But a low light level / high contrast situation like this was pretty 
good for testing available light type shooting.</p> 
<p>This is where we run into trouble. We can't shoot with the same lens on 
both cameras, at least not with the lens selection we had available that day. 
So I picked two lenses which were at least reasonably close, the<strong>Nikkor 
24-120mm f/3.5-5.6 VR</strong> and the <strong>Canon 24-105mm f/4 IS</strong>. 
Aperture was set to f/6.3 and the shots were taken in aperture priority mode at 
ISO 1600. The Nikon exposed at 1/50th second and the Canon at 1/40th second 
&ndash; not identical but close enough.</p> 
<p>Why ISO 1600? Because that's the Canon's highest setting without going into 
a boost mode. The Nikon doesn't go into a boost mode until above ISO 6400. I 
know that if we did the test with one camera at a settable ISO and the other 
boosted I'd hear no end of it. I also did shooting at other speeds, but not in 
a somewhat controlled comparison like this.</p> 
<p>Of course the Canon 1Ds MKIII is a 21MP camera and the Nikon D3 is a 12MP 
camera. This made for a difficult if not unfair comparison in many respects. 
How to you frame the shot? Same image size or same resolution? I don't know. 
Both approaches are flawed.</p> 
<p>In the end I said, <em>screw it</em>. I don't have all the answers. Let's 
just shoot a head and shoulder and see what we get. Whichever way I do it 
someone in the online world with greater tribal loyalties than common sense 
will get pissed off and claim foul, so I'll just do a test that satisfies my 
curiosity, and people can natter about it one way or the other if they wish.</p>
<h6> <br>

<h6> <br>
 Nikon D3 @ ISO 1600, 100% enlargement </h6> 
<p>Both cameras produced ISO 1600 images of astonishing quality. Would a Canon 
5D, reputed to be to date the lowest noise 35mm DSLR yet, be any better at this 
speed? I have no idea, since we didn't have one handy that day. What about the 
Canon 1D MKIII? Ditto. There wasn't one on hand. Would that have been a fairer 
point of comparison? Probably. The 1D MKIII's sensor at 10MP is closer to the 
D3's 12MP than the 1Ds MKIII's 21MP, and the pixels of the Nikon are bigger, so 
theoretically of lower noise. The D3 is also closer in price to the 1D MKIII 
than to the 1Ds MKIII.</p> 
<p>Right. We agree. But, the D3 is Nikon's current flagship, and the 1Ds MKIII 
is Canon's. Both started shipping within a day or two of each other in late 
November. How could we not resist the comparison?</p> 
<p>And what did we see? What <em>you</em> see above. Put aside the use of 
different lenses and the different sensor resolutions and just look at the 
noise and IQ characteristics.</p> 
<p>I see comparable resolving power and clarity (not absolute resolution, of 
course), and at least a one stop noise advantage to the new Nikon. Possibly 
there's a bit more shadow detail in the Canon frame though (look at the iris). 
The Nikon D3's low noise edge is also apparent at ISO 3200. The speeds of ISO 
6400, 12,800 and 25,600 are also possible on the Nikon D3, but not on the 
Canon, so there's no comparison to be made at these levels. And of course at 
the same magnifcation level the 1Ds MKIII provides a larger image because it 
has more pixles. There's no free lunch.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>ISO 25,600</h3> 
<p>The photograph at the top of the page was shot at ISO 25,600. Is it noisy? 
Yes, of course it is, but it's freek'n ISO 25,600. I don't care that it's 
noisy. This kind of sensitivity provides the ability to capture an image when 
another camera would simply record soot and shadow, or be forced to use a 
shutter speed so low as to render an unusable image. And unless you're a total 
gearheaded pixel-peeper, getting a photograph in tough conditions is much more 
important than any noise complaints.</p>

<h3>What About The Nikon D300? </h3> 
<p>The Nikon D300 was also on hand, and so I did some comparison shots with it 
as well.</p> 
<h6> <br>
 Nikon D300 @ ISO 1600, 100% enlargement </h6> 
<p>Sad to say, it's not in the same low noise league as either the D3 or the 
1Ds MKIII. Noise is more apparent, and though the exposure was 1/50th second vs 
the D3's 1/60th second (essentially identical), the image was overall quite a 
bit darker, indicating that the ISO was likely not what the camera indicated it 
was; maybe ISO 1000 in reality, and the apparent dynamic range somewhat less as 
well.</p> 
<h6><br>
 Nikon D300 with Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 @ 10mm and ISO 3200 </h6> 
<p>And again, before anyone disses the D300, I have been doing quite a few ISO 
1600 and ISO 3200 images during the week prior to writing this article, and 
find them to be more than acceptable. If you're a Nikon user, or thinking of 
becoming one and don't have the budget for a D3, the D300 is an extremely 
capable camera, as will be seen in my forthcoming review.</p> 
<p>I also thought it worth throwing the D300 into this comparison because 
clearly the D3 is not the end of the road for Nikon's flagship camera line. A 
higher megapixel full frame chip is absolutely inevitable, and the D300's noise 
characteristics may give us a hint at what to expect from a higher resolution 
D3 sensor. The only question is &ndash; when might it be introduced, and what 
will be the pixel count? Some informed sources have said that it will be 24MP 
and that introduction will be Q1 2008, with first shipments in Q2. We'll see.
</p> 
<p>As for pixel count, 24MP makes sense if you scale up the 12MP D300's 1.5X 
chip. So, does this mean that the noise characteristics of the D3(?) will be 
similar to the D300? Possibly, and so that's why I thought it worth including 
the D300 in our little experiment.</p> 
<p>And, as for those that have asked why, since I'm now going to be putting 
together a Nikon outfit to use along with my Canon gear, I didn't get a D3 
instead of a D300, the answer is that just as I own a 1Ds MkIII rather than a 
1D MkIII, I also will want a D3(?) rather than a D3. It better suites my needs.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> 
<p>As I wrote a little while earlier, based on initial impressions of the 
D300, and now their first full-frame CMOS camera, the D3, Nikon is now back in 
the IQ game. Canon has enjoyed a deserved reputation for high image quality, 
especially at high ISO. But now with the D3 Nikon has upped the ante, producing 
a camera that appears to offer lower noise than Canon (at least against the 
flagship 1Ds MKIII), and higher available speeds as well.</p> 
<h6><br>
 Canon 1Ds MKIII @ ISO 3200</h6> 
<h6> <br>
 100% crop at ISO 3200 </h6> 
<p>Before people draw any unwarranted conclusions it needs to be said that the 
1Ds MKIII is no slouch when it comes to high ISO performance. The shot above 
and its 100% crop show what the camera is capable of at ISO 3200. In a 
16X20&quot; print none of the artifacts seen in the 100% crop above is visible, 
and noise is extremely low. As I found onmy Madagascar shoot, you can work at 
virtually any ISO under any conditions and get usable, saleable images. And 
don't lose sight of the fact that you can do so at 5 FPS in 14 bit mode, and 
with 21 Megapixel files &ndash; the previous domain of medium format.</p> 
<p>And what about other performance and operational aspects? Those judgments 
will have to wait for me to spend more time with a D300 and D3, but will follow 
in the weeks and months ahead.</p> 
<p>One final comment if I may. If you're one of those people that takes 
exception to either my tests, my methodologies, or my conclusions, do us both a 
favour. Come onto this site's forum and state your objections here. Don't do it 
on some other site where you know I won't respond. If you're going to disagree 
with me, do so to my face. Regulars on my forum know that I never censor 
anything other than spam or obscene language. But be prepared to defend your 
position, just as I will mine. And, whatever you decide to do, do try and be 
grown up and polite. Anything less just obscures and defeats whatever validity 
there me be in what you have to say.</p> 
<p>December, 2007 </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Update:</p> 
<p>I forgot to mention that all images were shot raw and were processed in 
Lightroom 1.3.1. I don't care for Canon's DPP, and haven't yet become familiar 
with Nikon's Capture NX. Both of these might have done a different job on the 
raw files, but that's something for debate.</p>
