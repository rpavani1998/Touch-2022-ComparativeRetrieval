<h1>Hands On: Sony A77</h1> 
<p>by Chris Gampat on September 28, 2011</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>The other day, I finally got my hands on the extremely coveted Sony A77 
camera. Though the reviews have already started to come out, I&rsquo;m still 
waiting for my units to give them a full run through. However, this camera 
seemed extremely impressive during the brief time I spent with it.</p>

<h3><strong>Ergonomics</strong></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Sony A77 is one heck of a beefy DSLR camera; especially with the grip 
on. In fact, when the grip is on, it feels even beefier but still good in the 
hand. The grip and shutter release are in an interesting position 
ergonomically, and if I did use it, it would take some getting used to as 
opposed to those from Canon and Nikon.</p> 
<p>The build of the camera is both very Nikon-like and Canon-like. The shutter 
and aperture dials are like Nikon&rsquo;s, but the body feels like a Canon 7D 
in some ways.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The back of the camera features an ejection seat, dual rocket launchers, 
four mini guns to take out threats on the side, and twelve inches of steel 
armor. lots of functions. First off, there is a control joystick like on 
Canon&rsquo;s DSLR models. The back also features and Auto Exposure Lock button 
that it in just the right place. There is also a custom function button, 
display button, and that big LCD screen that flips out in a very innovative 
way. Above the LCD screen is that big, gorgeous, and amazing OLED viewfinder 
that I really love. Plus, there is the menu button. It makes a lot of sense to 
place that where it is.</p> 
<p>The top of the camera features the mode dial: which I which had a center 
button to lock it in place. The pop-up flash, finder/LCD button, ISO button, 
and drive buttons are also there. These seem much more Canon-like in placement, 
so holding the body felt like I was right at home.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The left side of the camera features the ports (and the focusing control 
dial; which is in an interesting place.) Here you can plug in a remote, HDMI 
cable, USB connection cable, microphone, or DC in cable.</p> 
<h3><strong>Build Quality</strong></h3> 
<p>Overall, the build quality of the A77 seemed very impressive. It&rsquo;s a 
solid body that isn&rsquo;t overly heavy, but still feels extremely robust. The 
Sony Rep told me that he shot a wedding with it this past weekend, and it was 
able to take all the normal punishment that a wedding photographer dishes out 
on their cameras. He also stated that the 16-50mm f2.8 lens handled extremely 
well when shooting the wedding. By that, it had great image quality, focuses 
quickly, and just overall worked well. Indeed, the 16-50mm was quite 
impressive, but I wasn&rsquo;t floored by it.</p> 
<p>The focusing with the lens was also relatively quick, but I still feel that 
my 7D wins in this case.</p> 
<h3><strong>Ease of Use</strong></h3> 
<p>Since I am used to both Canon and Nikon&rsquo;s systems, using this camera 
felt very familiar to me. The controls and dials felt just like one or the 
other and it was simple and easy to figure things out. I didn&rsquo;t dig into 
Sony&rsquo;s menus though. However, the display is very informational in that 
almost any setting that you&rsquo;d want is displayed across the top, side or 
bottom. When looking at that through the viewfinder, you really appreciate all 
the information that is easily displayed right in front of you. Because of 
this, your eye will probably never leave the viewfinder when shooting.</p> 
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t put a card in unfortunately, I was handling a 
pre-production model. However, Sony has made a very impressive step forward 
with the A77.</p>

 That is a little heavy &amp; high in my book.</p> 
<p>And the darn thing CAN NOT do or shoot TETHERED! &nbsp;<br>
 Get real Sony. 
&nbsp;Did you fired all Minolta&rsquo;s engineers/photographers?</p> 
<p>You can buy a cheap dslr from Kmart or Walmart that do shoot tethered for 
less than $500.00.</p> 
<p>The Sony NEX-7 is a much better buy. &nbsp;But this darn thing CAN NOT do
