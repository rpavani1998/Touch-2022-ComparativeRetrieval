<h2>Canon EOS 5D Mark III Hands-on Preview</h2> 
<p><i>by Shawn Barnett, Mike Tomkins, and Zig Weidelich<br>
Posted: 03/02/2012
</i></p> <br>

<p>Though Canon makes many excellent digital SLR cameras for pros and 
consumers, none has reached the superstar status of the Canon 5D series. The 
original 5D's 12.8-megapixel full-frame sensor produced legendary image 
quality, and the 5D Mark II raised the resolution to 21.1 megapixels and added 
superb video quality to the mix, creating a sensation in video production. The 
Canon 5D Mark III raises the game in terms of overall camera performance, from 
frame rate to autofocus, while increasing the resolution only slightly (by just 
over a million pixels to 22.3-megapixels). Of all the additional features, 
probably the most important is the new autofocus system, brought over from the 
1D X, which in addition to having more points (61) and more cross-type points 
(41), covers considerably more of the Canon 5D III's image area, while the AF 
system of the past two models were brought over from the company's APS-C 
cameras, thus covering much less image area in the viewfinder.</p> 
<p>Other additions include a DIGIC 5+ processor, which is said to be 17 times 
more powerful than the DIGIC 4 processor in the 5D II. The 7D's 63-zone 
dual-layer metering system reappears in the Canon 5D Mark III, instead of the 
1D X's 100,000-pixel RGB sensor. We'll go over the other features in more 
detail below, but the Canon 5D Mark III also includes a 150,000-cycle shutter 
rating; a new HDR mode; Full HD, 1080p video at 24, 25, and 30 frames per 
second; a 3.2-inch, 1.04M-dot LCD; a new CMOS sensor with higher sensitivity 
and an eight-channel readout that allows a 6-frame-per-second frame rate; a 
Quick Control dial that includes touch capability for silent adjustments while 
in video mode; multiple RAW image sizes; 100-percent viewfinder coverage with 
an adjustable LCD grid and AF overlay; a 1.5 percent spot meter; a dual-axis 
leveling system; and Standard or Quiet operation modes.</p> 
<p>The size and shape of the Canon 5D Mark III is similar to the Mark II, only 
a little heavier. The grip is sized right for the camera body, though somewhat 
large for small hands; it fit my medium-sized hands comfortably. Canon specs 
the body weight at 30.3 ounces (860g) body only. That's 1.7 ounces (50g) 
heavier than the 5D Mark II. Dimensions are 6.0 x 4.6 x 3.0 inches (152.0 x 
116.4 x 76.4mm). Only height and thickness have increased a millimeter or so.
<br> <br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Two minor elements are moved on the front of the Canon 5D Mark III: the 
Infrared port is now on the grip (where you'll find it on most every other 
Canon digital SLR with the feature), and the Depth-of-field preview button has 
moved to the grip-side of the body. The Self-timer lamp moves up to its usual 
position, and the monaural microphone moves from below to above the EOS 5D logo.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
 The top deck includes a Mode dial with the Auto+ mode, combined from 
the Creative Auto and Green Zone modes on the 5D Mark II. The 5D Mark III's 
power switch juts out from beneath this dial, as it does from the Canon 7D as 
well. Also from the 7D is the Multi-Function button behind the Shutter button. 
Canon has remapped the Status LCD.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The control cluster on the back of the Canon 5D Mark III resembles the 7D 
more than the 5D Mark II. Even so, keeping with Canon tradition, many buttons 
have shuffled around, and new ones created. Menu and Info buttons are 
well-placed on the upper left side of the LCD. Five buttons left of the LCD are 
Creative Style, a new Rate button, a Zoom button, and finally the Playback and 
Delete buttons. Rather than silkscreen the logo next to the button, Canon's 
eliminated the doubt and put the logo right on these buttons.</p> 
<p>Lower left of the LCD are three holes for the speaker, and a small window 
for the ambient light sensor, used to automatically adjust the LCD backlight.
</p> 
<p>Right of the LCD the controls are nearly all 7D, except for the new, more 
logical position of the Quick menu button, just upper left of the Quick Control 
dial. The Movie Record/Live View control includes a switch to select between 
modes, and a button to either start and stop Movie recording or to start and 
stop Live View mode. The Quick Control dial turns with its normal coarse click 
stops, but in Movie mode it also responds to touch for making silent 
adjustments whose noise won't appear in the audio track.</p> 
<p>The LCD itself is a 3:2 aspect ratio design that's just as gorgeous as 
recent models have been, with a 1.04-million dot array.</p> 
<p>The thumbgrip on the right is a little better than on the 5D Mark II, with 
a more comfortable taper down the length of the back, rather than a simple arc 
that didn't match the contours of the thumb.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The 5D Mark III's 22.3 megapixel, full-frame CMOS image sensor has a pixel 
pitch of 6.25 microns. Although resolution is almost unchanged, it now features 
eight-channel readout, gapless microlenses, and boasts improvements in 
transistor structure and on-chip noise reduction that should yield improved 
image quality, even for RAW shooters.</p> 
<p>Two reduced-resolution RAW modes are also available, providing 10.5 or 5.5 
megapixel resolution.</p> 
<p>Sensitivity ordinarily ranges from ISO 100 to 25,600 equivalents, and can 
be expanded to encompass ISO 50 to 102,400 equivalents. For video mode, the 
upper limit is capped at ISO 25,600 equivalent.</p> 
<p>Canon's DIGIC 5+ processor first appeared in the 1D X. Although the 5D Mark 
III uses only a single processor, Canon says it's 17 times more powerful than 
the Mark II's DIGIC 4 chip.</p> 
<p>As well as enabling faster 6 fps burst shooting, there's also more power 
for noise reduction, and Canon is predicting a two-stop improvement for JPEG 
shooting. The greater performance is also used to add real-time chromatic 
aberration correction for both still and movie shooting.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Mark III's 61-point autofocus sensor is also borrowed from the EOS 1D 
X. As in that camera, there are 41 cross-type points, of which 20 work to 
f/4.0, and 21 are f/5.6 capable. Of the latter, five will work as 
high-precision points to f/2.8. The remaining points are horizontal line-types, 
sensitive to f/5.6.</p> 
<p>Also new since the 5D Mark II is Canon's AI Servo III, which is quicker to 
start tracking your subject, and should handle momentary obstructions between 
camera and subject more gracefully.</p> 
<p>The 5D Mark III's 63-zone dual-layer iFCL metering sensor was first seen in 
the EOS 7D. The top layer is sensitive to red and green, while the bottom layer 
detects blue and green. This full-color metering allows better subject 
detection, information which is also fed back to the autofocus system to 
further aid subject tracking.</p> 
<p>As well as evaluative, partial, and center-weighted, there's also a tighter 
1.5% spot metering mode.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Like its predecessor, the 5D Mark III has a Canon EF lens mount, and 
doesn't accept sub-frame EF-S lenses. Thanks to its full-frame sensor, there's 
no focal length crop.</p> 
<p>The shutter mechanism is rated as good for 150,000 shots, unchanged from 
the 5D Mark II. A 'Silent' shooting mode reduces operation noise, but reduces 
burst-shooting speed to three frames per second.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The 5D Mark III's viewfinder now has 100% coverage and a 22mm eyepoint, 
both slightly upgraded from the previous model. As in the EOS 7D, there's an 
on-demand grid function, and you can also display the locations of the 61 
focusing points.</p> 
<p>Like the 1D X, there's a 3.2-inch Clear View II LCD panel with a high 
resolution of approximately 1,040,000 dots.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Of course, there's still a monochrome status display on the top deck, as 
well.</p> 
<p>The EOS 5D Mark III's video functionality is similar to that of the 1D X, 
but with an important addition: a headphone jack for audio monitoring, useful 
given the ability to adjust audio levels during recording. (You can also adjust 
ISO sensitivity, shutter speed, and aperture as the video is captured.)</p> <br>
<br> <br>
<br>

<p> As well as 1080p 24/25/30 fps and VGA 25/30 fps, there's now a 720p 50/60 
fps mode. The 4GB recording limit is gone, and you can save clips as long as 29 
minutes, 59 seconds in all resolutions. Compression choices are ALL-I 
intraframe or IPB interframe, with embedded free-run or rec-run timecode. Canon 
says that video moire has been greatly reduced since the 5D Mark II.</p> 
<p>As well as the previously-mentioned microphone and headphone jacks, the 5D 
Mark III also offers up a PC sync terminal, combined standard-def AV output / 
USB 2.0 High Speed port, wired remote control port, and high-def HDMI video 
output.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Dual card slots mean that the 5D Mark III can now record to either UDMA 7 
CompactFlash or Secure Digital cards, including SDHC and SDXC. Interestingly, 
as well as using the secondary card as an overflow or duplicate, or to 
segregate by file type, you can also record different RAW or JPEG types to each 
card. For example, you could save full-res RAWs on one card, and reduced-res 
mRAWs on the other.</p> 
<p>The 5D Mark III takes the same LP-E6 battery pack as the 5D Mark II, 
letting you save a little money if you're planning on upgrading from the older 
model, but have a stack of batteries on hand.</p> 
<p>Battery life is rated to CIPA testing standards at 950 shots with the 
viewfinder, or 200 shots in live view mode, at 73&deg;F / 23&deg;C. This can be 
approximately doubled by shooting with two packs, using the BG-E11 battery grip.
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5D 
Mark III caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a 
less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself. The Full 
Auto mode has been upgraded, and Canon says it will now do a better job of 
recognizing the appropriate scene type.</p> 
<p>The Mode dial has a central locking button, as seen on the 60D. (This was 
also available as an option on the 7D and 5D Mark II, but here it's the 
default.)</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>A new Rate button to the left of the LCD provides instant access to image 
rating functionality, letting you assign anywhere from one to five stars for 
each image. The 5D Mark III also adopts Canon's Q button, just to the right of 
the LCD, for quick-control functions.</p> 
<p>On the top deck, you can now assign the Multi-Function button to instantly 
switch between RAW and JPEG shooting with a single press.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The EOS 5D Mark III's body includes weather-sealing to a level said to be 
better than that of the 5D Mark II, but not to the same degree as an EOS 
1-series body like the EOS-1D X.</p> 
<p>There are quite a few significant changes to the 5D Mark III's firmware, as 
well. For the first time in an EOS model other than the 1-series, the 5D Mark 
III can now capture 2, 3, 5, or 7 shots in a bracketed sequence. This will be 
particularly useful to fans of HDR photography, and if you don't want to deal 
with processing HDR images yourself, there's also an in-camera three-shot HDR 
mode, a first for an EOS model. Four different processing effects are 
available. You can also opt to have the source images saved along with the HDR 
shot, so if you're not satisfied with the result achieved in-camera, you can 
reprocess the HDR on your computer.</p> 
<p>The 5D Mark III also offers up a multiple exposure function. Just like the 
1D X, you can combine up to nine frames into a single exposure in-camera. 
There's also a dual-axis level display, similar to that of the EOS 7D.</p> 
<p>In Playback mode, you can now process RAW images in-camera, and take 
advantage of the lens correction functions when doing so. Among the user 
requests that Canon has heard and answered with the 5D Mark III, there's now a 
side-by-side comparative playback display (including synced magnification and a 
histogram function), plus the ability to manually set the first four characters 
of image file names.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Alongside the 5D Mark III, Canon has launched a new flagship flash strobe. 
The Speedlite 600EX-RT allows not only the line-of-sight optical wireless 
functionality of existing units, but also a new two-way radio connectivity, 
with 30 meters / 98.4 feet range. Remote camera triggering is possible from a 
flash strobe. 15 radio channels are available (plus auto), and up to 15 
Speedlite flashes can be used on a channel, in as many as five groups, with 
each group separately able to be set to E-TTL or controlled manually. A 4-digit 
wireless radio ID&nbsp;can be assigned to separate radio networks.</p> 
<p>The 600EX-RT has a guide number of 60 meters / 197 feet at maximum zoom, 
and has a zoom range of 20 to 200mm. It also has a more rugged shoe mount, and 
ships with a gel filter holder and tungsten / fluorescent filters.</p> <br>
<br>
<br> <br>

<p>There's also a new ST-E3-RT transmitter, similar to the existing ST-E2, but 
with support for the new two-way radio system.</p> 
<p>The 5D Mark III uses a new BG-E11 battery grip, which includes a duplicate 
multi-controller for portrait shooting.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>There's a new WFT-E7A wireless file transmitter that also supports the EOS 
7D and 60D, and includes 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi and gigabit Ethernet.</p> 
<p>An external GP-E2 GPS receiver connects to the camera via USB, and mounts 
on the hotshoe or off-camera. As well as recording latitude, longitude, 
altitude, and UTC time in the EXIF header of images, it has a compass function, 
and can capture GPS track logs.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Canon 5D Mark III Demonstration Videos</h2> 
<p>We shot some videos to illustrate the Canon 5D Mark III's various new 
features, as well as a video of how the Canon 600EX RT's radio flash works with 
the 5D Mark III.</p> 
<p>First, Chuck Westfall demonstrates the Canon 5D Mark III's various 
autofocus patterns:</p>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>A new version of Canon's Digital Photo Professional software ships with the 
5D Mark III. As well as supporting new features of the camera, it adds a 
Digital Lens Optimizer function for still images. This refers to a built-in 
database that allows automatic correction of both spherical and chromatic 
aberration, astigmatism, curvature of field, diffraction, and low-pass filter 
effects.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Canon expects to ship the 5D Mark III in the US market from the end of 
March 2012. Pricing is set at around US$3,500 body-only, or US$4,300 in a kit 
with an EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens.</p> 
<p>The BG-E11 grip is priced at around US$490, and the WFT-E7A wireless file 
transmitter at about US$850. The GP-E2 GPS receiver costs around US$390. All 
three accessories ship from April 2012.</p> 
<p>Finally, the new Speedlite 600EX-RT costs US$630 or thereabouts, and the 
new ST-E3-RT transmitter is priced at approximately US$470. These will be 
available alongside the camera itself in March.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h2>Canon 5D Mark III&nbsp;(Beta) Image Quality</h2> 
<p>Below are crops comparing a beta-level Canon 5D Mark III&nbsp;to the Canon 
5D&nbsp;Mark II, Canon 7D, Nikon D4, Nikon D3X, and Sony A77. Though we 
normally start with ISO 1,600 here, we thought we'd start with the base ISO to 
show the best each camera can do.</p> 
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These images are best quality JPEGs straight out of 
the camera, at default settings including noise reduction. All cameras in this 
comparison were shot with our very sharp reference lenses. Also, because the 5D 
Mark III is a beta unit, keep in mind image quality may not be representative 
of final production models.</p> 
<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 5D Mark II ISO&nbsp;100</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Canon 5D Mark III at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <b>Canon 5D Mark II at ISO 100</b> <br>
<p>The 5D Mark III has slightly improved contrast and certainly more 
resolution. The mosaic crop is noticeably sharper, and the pink swatch has 
excellent detail, and the red leaf swatch is pretty respectable. Otherwise, 
it's not a huge change at ISO 100 from the 5D Mark II.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 7D at ISO 100</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Canon 
5D Mark III at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <b>Canon 7D at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <br>

<p>18 to 22 megapixels isn't that large a difference, but it's clear that the 
5D Mark III is able to resolve a little more detail.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D4 at ISO 100</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Canon 
5D Mark III at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <b>Nikon D4 at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <br>

<p>Nikon's new D4 has a 16-megapixel sensor designed for greater speed and 
low-light performance, but it does give something away in the resolution 
department, at least here at ISO 100. Interestingly--and unsurprisingly--the D4 
does a little better with the red leaf swatch at ISO 100, but misses the 
texture of the pink swatch beneath. The 5D Mark III renders the pink swatch a 
little more magenta than it should.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D3X at ISO 100</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Canon 
5D Mark III at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <b>Nikon D3X at ISO 100</b> <br>

<p>Nikon's 24 megapixel D3X turns the previous assessment on its head a bit, 
as the D3x probably picks up a bit more detail than the 5D Mark III.</p> <br>

<br> <br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Sony A77 at ISO 100</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Canon 
5D Mark III at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <b>Sony A77 at ISO&nbsp;100</b> <br>

<p>The 5D Mark III does well against Sony's 24-megapixel A77, though we found 
the A77 to be a little less sharp than the NEX-7. Still, they're pretty close. 
The Canon retains more of the vibrant color in the red swatch, and its 
rendering of the pink swatch has more detail and gets the color closer to 
correct, while the A77 makes it look more purple.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Most digital SLRs and CSCs will produce an excellent ISO 100 shot, so we 
like to push them and see what they can do compared to other cameras at ISO 
1,600, 3,200, and 6,400. Recent advances in sensor technology have made ISO 
1,600 look a lot more like ISO 100, but there are still cameras whose quality 
starts to fall apart at this setting. We also choose 1,600 because we like to 
be able to shoot at least at this level when indoors and at night.</p> 
<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 5D Mark II ISO 1,600</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 1,600</b> <b>Canon 5D Mark II at ISO 1,600</b> <br>

<p>Your eyes can see clearly the benefit of the 5D Mark III over the Mark II, 
particularly in the mosaic image. There's more contrast and sharper detail. The 
exception is the red leaf swatch, which while somewhat cartoonish in the 5D 
Mark II's rendering, is softer from the 5D Mark III.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 7D at ISO 1,600</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 1,600</b> <b>Canon 7D at ISO 1,600</b> <br>

<p>The advantage to a full frame sensor over an APS-C-sized sensor is quite 
clear without my calling out why in these shots. The 5D Mark III's image is 
crisp compared to the grainy and soft 7D at ISO 1,600.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D4 at ISO 1,600</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 1,600</b> <b>Nikon D4 at ISO 1,600</b> <br>

<p>Nikon's 16.2-megapixel D4 took a different approach to full-frame, 
preferring low res for better low-light performance and higher frame rate in 
their pro press camera, and it clearly pays off here. While the 5D Mark III has 
slightly better detail in higher contrast subjects, the D4 renders the 
troublesome red swatch as if it were no problem at all.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D3X at ISO 1,600</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Canon 5D Mark III at ISO&nbsp;1,600</b> <b>Nikon D3X at ISO 1,600</b> <br>

<p>Here again it's a mixed bag, with the 5D Mark III showing more crisp detail 
with higher contrast, but the D3X showing an overall more even appearance 
regardless of the nature of the element. The 5D Mark III retains more fabric 
texture in the pink swatch at this ISO setting, though.</p> <br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Sony A77 at ISO 1,600</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>

<p>The superior resolution of the Sony A77 is lost a bit to noise suppression 
in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark 
mosaic background.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Today's ISO 3,200 is yesterday's ISO 1,600 (well, almost), so below are the 
same crops at ISO 3,200.</p> 
<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 5D Mark II ISO 3,200</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 3,200</b> <b>Canon 5D Mark II at ISO 3,200</b> <br>

<p>Here's a clear demonstration of the improvements both to the sensor and the 
noise suppression technology found in the 5D Mark III. The 5D Mark II's images 
look downright hazy by comparison.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 7D at ISO 3,200</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>As if to underscore the advantage of full frame and Canon's recent 
advancement, the Canon 7D's ISO 3,200 images are even fuzzier, seen as if 
through frosted glass by comparison.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D4 at ISO 3,200</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>

<p>The Nikon D4, by comparison, does quite a bit better, with a similar, if 
smaller, rendition of the mosaic tile, and a better version of the red leaf 
swatch. The D4 image is a bit grainier, however, particularly in the shadows.
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D3X at ISO 3,200</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>

<p>Images from the D3X are quite a bit grainier, but again the image is very 
even across disparate elements. The Canon 5D Mark III's image is quite smooth, 
though, offering very similar levels of detail. Both look very good.</p> <br>

<br> <br>

<h3>Canon 5D Mark III versus Sony A77 at ISO 3,200</h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>

<p>Noise and noise suppression continue to mar the Sony A77's images at ISO 
3,200, with a slight loss of color as well. It's still a decent performance 
from the A77, but the 5D Mark III clearly has an advantage.</p> <br>

<b>Detail comparison</b>. High-contrast 
details are often sharper as ISO rises, so they're worth a look as well. Thanks 
to what seems to be a higher level of contrast as ISO increases, the Canon 5D 
does very well compared to all other contenders. Its only clear rival at 
rendering the lines between the letters at ISO 6,400 is the 24-megapixel D3X. 
The red seems a little brighter in the Nikons at 6,400 as well. The D4 suffers 
a bit at this element primarily because if its lower resolution overall. <br>

<br> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Canon's 5D Mark III indeed looks quite improved over the 5D Mark II, 
despite the slightly smaller pixel pitch. It also shapes up well against 
Nikon's 24-megapixel D3X, an impressive feat. Even if they were playing a bit 
of catch-up, it seems we can say they've caught up quite well.</p>

<h3>Learn about the Canon <b>HS System</b></h3> 
<p><strong>The Canon HS System takes the frustration out of low-light 
photography.</strong><br>
The system is the result of two technologies: a 
high-sensitivity imaging sensor that's able to capture more light and Canon's 
DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image 
processing, delivering maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. So you get 
sharper, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, without using the flash.
