<p>The sound is one that spun a Canon 1D shooter's head around faster than 
Linda Blair's in the Exorcist (doubleclick on the picture below to download the 
sound to your computer). I actually mashed my D2h shutter release down recently 
just to see what the Canon shooters near me would do. And the reaction was just 
as described--twisted heads. Long used to bragging rights on action bursts with 
their 1D cameras, Canon users on the sidelines of professional sports 
everywhere now know there's a new boy in town, the D2h. [Of course, Canon 
countered by updating the 1D, which now has a larger buffer and comes closer to 
matching the length of the D2h's burst.]</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Still, the D2h is a bit controversial. Announced in late summer 2003, it 
didn't begin to ship until November 2003. Despite this somewhat 
later-than-expected arrival, the D2h only provides a 4 megapixel sensor, which 
basically matches what the Canon 1D had (for some time), and is only half what 
the Canon 1D Mark II came out with. Thus, early grumbling in the various 
Internet digital photography forums all immediately went into a &quot;too 
little, too late&quot; versus &quot;all that we need&quot; debate. So let's 
delve into the camera and make up our own minds.</p>

&nbsp; 
<h4>The Basics</h4> 
<p>The D2h is a complete redesign from the D1 series cameras. While the family 
heritage is obvious, virtually every significant aspect of the camera has been 
rethought. This is not &quot;some new features in a D1 package&quot; type of 
design. I'm impressed that Nikon has taken the time to try to improve, refine, 
and innovate in as many places as it has. Every control, every body curve, and 
even every part deep in the body (frame, shutter, etc.) seems to have been 
touched. Thus, we have our work cut out just running down the feature set and 
changes to it.</p> 
<p>Less obvious than all the external changes is the sensor, buried deep in 
the all-black body. Nikon has freed themselves from the Sony sensor parade with 
this camera, coming up with a new one of their own. Technically, it's nearly a 
CMOS-type sensor (except with JFET instead of MOSFET transistors). Nikon 
literature refers to it as a JFET LBCAST sensor (Junction Field Effect 
Transistor, Lateral Buried Charge Accumulator and Sensing Transistor array) 
because that describes the unique design that underlies each photosite. In 
Nikon's launch PR, the company made significant claims about this new 
technology. Specifically, that it had the low-power and direct addressing 
characteristics of CMOS and the low-noise and dark current properties of a CCD. 
Since the launch event, Nikon has been quieter about the noise issues, 
emphasizing the high speed data processing capabilities of the chip more than 
the noise tendencies. The bottom line remains the same, however: Nikon has 
produced a sensor of their own design, and it's competitive with other 
technologies. That alone should send shivers down Sony's spine, as now the four 
leaders in DSLR sales, Canon, Kodak, Fujifilm, and Nikon all have sensor 
technology of their own.</p> 
<p>(I should perhaps make a comment about Nikon's sensor noise comments at the 
D2h launch. Most of the translations I saw--and the comments made by Nikon 
officials at the US and European launchs--led everyone to believe that the 
claim was &quot;the pixels from a D2h will be lower in noise than any existing 
camera.&quot; That's not my take after re-reading the Japanese slides and press 
accounts of the launch in Tokyo. The claim that was made is that LBCAST chip 
itself is inherently less noisy than an equivalent CMOS sensor. Note, however, 
that both LBCAST and CMOS absolutely require that you run noise reduction 
techniques on the photosite data. Thus, while the sensor itself may produce 
less noise in photosite data than, say, Canon's CMOS sensor, it still needs to 
be run through noise reduction. And there Nikon didn't make any significant 
claims [e.g., they didn't say &quot;our noise reduction techniques are better 
than Canon's]. Indeed, Nikon's noise reduction techniques seem relatively 
simple (dark current substraction, etc.) compared to Canon's. Thus, I didn't 
really have any clear expectations on how noisy or how un-noisy the D2h images 
will be. Personally, I hoped for &quot;better,&quot; but I never quantified 
that in my mind.)</p> 
<p>We'll get to actual sensor performance later in the review, but I do want 
to emphasize a couple of things: the fact that this is a JFET chip means that 
one of the power-hogs in the D1 series has been eliminated. Second, the fact 
that Nikon uses dual-channel processing on the chip is what gives the camera 
the ability to run at 8 frames per second. Finally, since each photosite is 
directly addressable, noise reduction and other image processing techniques can 
be performed at the pixel level<em>prior to</em> passing to a central DSP 
(digital signal processor), again potentially speeding up operations. This 
particular sensor is designed for speed.</p> 
<p>Other sensor-related items have changed, as well. In particular, Nikon has 
used a thinner, less aggressive low pass (anti-aliasing) filter. This means 
that the capture acuity is actually visibly higher on the D2h than it is on the 
D1x. Note that acuity is not the same as resolution, however. We're talking 
about edge definitions, not the size of the edge that can be captured. I've 
seen others on the Internet already start incorrectly making the comment that 
the D2h's resolution is higher than the D1x's. That's certainly not true in the 
horizontal axis, but people are interpreting sharp-appearing D2h images as 
having more resolution than anti-aliased D1x images, which is wrong. In a 
perfect world we want both (more resolution and more acuity), but in the real 
Nikon world we have one or the other. Personally, I do prefer edge acuity over 
resolution, but I also don't produce large fine art prints from my work. One 
potential problem with Nikon's decision on the filter: there will be a stronger 
tendency to produce color moire patterns on fine, repeating detail; this is not 
a camera destined to for serious fashion shoots, IMHO.</p> 
<p>The D2h feature set is essentially state-of-the-art. I'll not repeat the 
full list of features here, but instead point out some of the things that are 
changed or added from the D1 series:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> The vertical shooting grip gets a front command dial. <br>
</li> 
<li>The color LCD is bigger and brighter than before.</li> 
<li>Voice annotation is built in.</li> 
<li>White balance can be set directly in Kelvin values, and white balance now 
has its own dedicated sensor at the front of the prism; custom white balance is 
simple, can be done in two different ways, and you can save settings with names 
you provide.</li> 
<li>A new, user-assignable FUNC button has appeared on the front of the 
camera. The list of possible assignments is shorter than I'd like (you should 
be able to assign it to depth of field for the vertical release, for example), 
but it still provides some flexibility that wasn't on previous models.</li> 
<li>The viewfinder now features additional informational displays--virtually 
every significant setting can be seen without taking your eye from the finder.
</li> 
<li>Speaking of the viewfinder, the blackout time during shots is so minimal 
that you'll easily be able to follow action at 8 fps. Coupled with a shutter 
release lag of as little as 37ms, this has got to be the fastest (non-pellicle) 
SLR ever made.</li> 
<li>The autofocus system is completely new, quite complex, and versatile. An 
11-sensor array covers all but the corners of the image area, and can be 
configured to operate in enough different ways to confound even those that 
study the manual carefully.</li> 
<li>The Autofocus Direction pad now has a center push ability, which is used 
to advantage in a number of different ways (it brings up the histogram when an 
image is displayed, for example).</li> 
<li>NEF and JPEG files can be written simultaneously for each image, and you 
can choose the size and quality of the JPEG file to be written.</li> 
<li>An interval timer has been added to allow time-lapse and unattended 
photography.</li> 
<li>AI and later manual focus lenses can be used with the matrix meter (after 
a bit of data input, and only in Aperture-priority and Manual exposure modes).
</li> 
<li>The camera can track vertical position and auto-rotate images in Nikon 
View.</li> 
<li>The camera uses USB 2.0 for computer connections and connection to the 
optional WT-1 wireless transmitter. The wireless transmitter allows 802.11b ftp 
transfers from camera to computer at ranges up to 500 feet (with the optional 
extension antenna; otherwise 100 feet).</li> 
<li>A new flash technology has been added, which Nikon's schizophrenic 
marketing department can't quite decide whether to call i-TTL or CLS (creative 
lighting system). The details of this addition are too varied and complex to 
describe in this review; I'll have more to say in my review of the SB-800, 
which is required to implement the new flash system.</li> 
<li>A new EN-EL4 lithium battery is used, and we can see exact battery life 
remaining. The camera even tracks battery charges and recommends when new ones 
should be obtained! Unfortunately we get new battery chargers and AC adapters 
because of this.</li> </ul> 
<p>On this last point I must criticize Nikon severely: traveling 
photographers--of which I'm most certainly one--already have to cope with 
carrying more equipment after the transition to digital. If I want to carry a 
D2h and another Nikon body as backup, I now have to carry two sets of 
batteries, two sets of battery chargers, and two sets of AC adapters (to allow 
sensor cleaning). And that's not even considering that I need to carry yet 
another set of batteries and charger for my AA's used in the flash units. This 
is a very typical example of what happens when talented engineers don't pay 
enough attention to users. Message to Nikon: stop sprouting new batteries and 
chargers like weeds, and standardize on one or two. You won't be able to get 
away with such cavalier design long term.</p> 
<p>The list of specification changes or additions I'd ask for is relatively 
minimal:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It would be nice to have ISO 100 (to match all the charts published in 
Nikon flash manuals, including the SB-800).</li> 
<li>I'd like even more control over the patterns used by the autofocus sensors 
(e.g., &quot;detect only horizontal motion&quot;).</li> 
<li> Now that we have a better battery, I'd like more control over the self 
timer settings, especially longer ones. <br>
</li> 
<li>We need individual channel histograms as an option. Indeed, since you can 
pull up a histogram with a center press of the Autofocus Direction pad, make 
that pull up the current luminance histogram and then put the channel 
histograms on other info pages you browse through.</li> 
<li>Since the battery charge is known, the cleaning mode really should allow 
cleaning with a battery (if remaining power is greater than XX%).</li> </ul> 
<p>While some might ask for more megapixels, I'm willing to wait for a D2x 
based upon the same design that trades speed for resolution. The problem, of 
course, is that Canon's offering, the 1D Mark II, has an 8mp sensor, so Nikon 
really does need to address the D2h's resolution gap to stay even in the race.
</p> 
<h4>Handling</h4> 
<p>Nikon is learning. I just wish they'd learn faster.</p> 
<p>First off, let me say that this is a stylish body design. Lines are clean, 
markings are clear, and there's less of impromptu design feel to it than we had 
in the D1 series. It appears that curves and placement of ridges was more 
carefully considered to help handling characteristics.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, if you have smallish hands, as I do, you'll find some of the 
positions of controls are wrong. In particular, if you hold the camera 
primarily using the front grip, you'll find the thumb reach to the Autofocus 
Direction pad is a little long. The center of the pad ought to be where the 
right edge currently is. Likewise, reaching to hit the AF-ON or AE-L buttons 
with your thumb tends to move your hand position back around the grip, which 
means you don't have quite as solid a hold on the camera. If you have large 
hands (can get more than an octave spread on the piano) or are shooting with 
gloves, these positions are less problematic, but be forewarned: Nikon isn't 
designing for small hands.</p> 
<p>The vertical grip continues that problem. The reach for the Autofocus 
Direction pad is even greater when holding the camera vertically, and the Depth 
of Field button is no longer reachable without moving your hand position off 
the shutter release (one of the reasons why I said the FUNC button needs to 
have other options, such as Depth of Field--you can almost reach that button 
from the vertical release with small hands).</p> 
<p>On the flip side, the large number of buttons required for a digital body 
are all well marked, large, and nicely recessed on the D2h. It's both easy to 
activate a function as well as not easy to accidentally activate a function. 
That's just the way it should be. The AF-ON and AE-L buttons have been slightly 
offset at a diagonal so that they're easier to distinguish from one another 
(the AF-ON is the upper button). The ISO, QUAL, and WB buttons are larger than 
on the D1 series, and again nicely recessed yet accessible.</p> 
<p>The two new buttons on the back are a good news, bad news pair. The voice 
annotation button is deeply recessed (you have to really want to use it to 
access it--thus you don't accidentally waste space recording noise due to 
accidental pressing). The Autofocus Area Mode Selector (hey I don't make these 
names up) is going to confuse many, however, at least at first. That's because 
some of the selections also add Closest Subject Priority when selected, some 
don't. Some show the active sensor in the display, some don't. And they all 
interact with a couple of Custom Settings, which control the release-priority 
versus focus-priority choice, and the pattern that's used in Group Dynamic AF. 
If you were confused by Single Area AF versus Dynamic Area AF, you're going to 
need to study these new controls--they add a great degree of choice to your 
autofocus options, but they are not obviously intuitive, even to veteran Nikon 
users.</p> 
<p>One handling aspect that's welcomed is the new information in the 
viewfinder. Not only will you know how many shots are left on your card (or how 
many you've taken), but you can see white balance settings, ISO, image quality 
settings, and more. If you learn where all the controls are, there's no reason 
to take your eye from the finder, exactly the way you want a camera designed 
for action photography.</p> 
<p>White balance is more flexible and more easily controlled than before. 
Custom white balance can be done from a gray card or the incident white balance 
meter in the camera. Kelvin settings can be set directly (though at 
pre-determined values). White balance settings can be named. White balance 
settings can be &quot;obtained&quot; from images already on the storage card. 
White balance itself is measured via a dedicated incident sensor at the front 
of the viewfinder. A nice step forward overall.</p> 
<p>Custom Settings have been grouped in a meaningful way, getting rid of the 
old scroll-through-30+-functions method of locating what you want to set. 
Custom Settings banks can be named, making it easier to remember what's 
different about Bank B than Bank A.</p> 
<p>The new battery is nice in a couple of ways. First, it's smaller than the 
EN-4 that was in the D1 series. Second, it doesn't have any exposed contacts, 
so you don't have to worry about putting that little plastic end cap on when 
you stick multiple batteries into a pack or pocket. Third, you get relatively 
accurate charge remaining information, should you need it. No longer do you 
have to guess whether the half-full battery indicator means you're about to 
have a dead battery or you've still got some life left in it. On the flip side, 
the silly camera end cap is a detail I could have lived without. Essentially, 
you have to &quot;assemble&quot; the end cap and battery every time you change 
batteries. Why not just give me a door to insert the battery through?</p> 
<p>Connections to the camera (video, AC in, USB 2.0) all attach via connectors 
on the left side of the camera. Unlike the D1 series, the rubber doors that sit 
over these connectors seem to stay closed, and provide a pretty good weather 
seal. Moreover, a side location is better than the previous front location if 
you hold cameras in the traditional manner (left hand under lens, right hand on 
grip).</p> 
<p>  Sensor cleaning is no different with the new model than previous. Nikon 
disclaims all but blower bulb cleaning, and you can't clean without an AC 
adapter. Yuck. This means that I have to travel with my extra cost AC adapter. 
Have Nikon engineers actually<em>traveled</em> with their products? </p> 
<p>  One small touch that has gone unnoticed in other reviews: the eyepiece 
won't unscrew unless you first close the viewfinder eyepiece shutter. For 
years, we Nikon pros have been slowly losing our eyepieces when they rattled 
out from vibration or whatever; no more. Thank you, Nikon.</p> 
<p>  Overall, handling aspects have improved slightly from the D1 series 
(which was already quite good), though those with small hands need to be aware 
that they might be uncomfortable with the reach to the Autofocus Direction pad 
and AF-ON/AE-L buttons. </p>

Nikon DSLR Report is the only way to learn more about getting the most from 
your camera.</p> 
<p><b>Cleaning the CCD</b></p> 
<p>I've now posted an article on how to clean the CCD.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
&nbsp; 
<h4>Performance</h4> 
<p>Battery performance is superb. Really superb. The camera seems to power 
down gracefully, for example, much like the old film bodies. If you 
accidentally leave the camera on overnight with a full battery, the camera 
still claims ~87% battery charge 24 hours later, and that figure seems 
accurate. About the only thing I could find that draws down the battery quickly 
is very long bulb exposures or tethered use. A 10-minute exposure can pull the 
battery down 25% or slightly more. This shows just how much power conservation 
is going on normally; a lot! I can't imagine a situation where I'd need more 
than two batteries for a day's shoot, though there may be a few prolific 
photojournalists out there that disagree. Indeed, if you shoot less than 500 
images in a session, you'll probably do fine with just one battery. Batteries 
charge modestly fast. Several charges from under 30% power remaining have taken 
just a bit under 90 minutes; Nikon claims about a 100 minute full charge time, 
and I've yet to have any charge go that long.</p> 
<p>CompactFlash write performance <em>can be</em> superb. I use the words 
&quot;can be&quot; because I have encountered a few older cards that don't 
achieve the fast write performance the D2h is capable of. But with a WA enabled 
card or other state-of-the-art card, write performance on the D2h is faster 
than any DSLR I've encountered to date, and by a fairly comfortable margin. 
[Here at the end of 2004, a few cameras are starting to catch up; but the D2h 
still remains state-of-the-art, which is saying something for a camera that's 
been out for more than year.] It appears that burst write speeds on the D2h can 
be as much as 2x the D100 with a WA card (you can't directly compare file write 
speeds, as the file sizes are different).Rob Galbraith has tabulated D2h write 
performance on his site, and my results are right in line with his--with the 
right card the D2h is state-of-the-art fast. With the wrong card, it's merely 
mid-pack to fast.</p> 
<p>Autofocus performance is superb, though requires learning to use well. Once 
you learn how all the controls interact and find the settings that work for the 
situations you photograph, you'll find that the new autofocus system is fast, 
sure, and reliable. But you have to learn the nuances to get the most from it, 
especially since both the group dynamic autofocus and default autofocus 
positions re-introduce closest subject priority as an option. Be prepared to 
spend some quality time with a convenient moving subject practicing with the 
various autofocus settings. Nine of the 11 autofocus sensors are low-light, 
low-contrast capable, which makes it hard to find a situation where the camera 
won't focus (though it's still possible). And if you are having problems with 
that, use an SB-800 set up to<em>only</em> provide AF-Assist illumination (you 
can finally set it up so that no flash triggers). I wish the reach to the 
Autofocus Direction pad was better for my hands, but even though I have to 
stretch to reach it, I still like this system a lot.</p> 
<p>Color integrity is usually excellent, just as it has been with previous 
Nikon DSLRs, but with one caveat, which I'll get to in a moment. Some other 
reviewers have remarked about getting more saturation out of their D2h shots, 
but once I make my usual post-processing adjustments I don't see any 
significant difference from older Nikon DSLRs. You have a choice of three color 
spaces, and the sRGB and AdobeRGB spaces seem accurate in my early testing, 
again with some caveats (see end of paragraph and next paragraph). Since white 
balance is easier to master on this camera than previous Nikon DSLRs, it all 
adds up to getting solid color results for those paying attention. But there's 
a wrinkle in the ointment: things that emit near IR appear to bamboozle the 
camera in a couple of ways. I first noticed this when I was trying to 
photograph some of my mom's paintings for her. The center area in one of her 
paintings just wouldn't get the color right, and it had a bit of strange noise 
in it (the rest of the painting was color accurate, as expected). Others on the 
net have noted that use of a hot mirror filter (filters out near IR) changes 
the camera's noise and color tendencies with certain fabrics and objects. Well, 
they're right. It appears that any object that reflects near IR has a tendency 
to run up the blue channel response in the D2h, which in turn makes for slight 
color shifts and increased noise. Note that flash emits a great deal of near IR 
and IR light, and I've indeed run into the problem more often indoors using 
flash than elsewhere. A hot mirror filter does seem to eradicate the problem, 
at the expense of small light loss overall. Ironically, Canon is one of the few 
makers of a 77mm hot mirror filter, and Nikon doesn't make one.</p> 
<p>A second color problem took me longer to recognize: in some situations the 
camera has a green bias that can be ugly (see the software section in my eBook 
for a full example of this). More often than not the green bias shows up in 
shaded areas--if a subject is well and evenly lit and you've set the white 
balance correctly, this problem isn't present. But when you've got neutrals in 
a shaded area<em>and</em> a well lit other area, you can easily see it. It's 
easy enough to deal with, but annoying.</p> 
<p>Edge acuity is pretty darned good, though it comes with a minor caveat 
(potential moire). Still, an unsharpened D2h image set next to the same number 
of pixels from a D100 or D1x simply looks like it has the more detail due to 
the acuity produced by the thinner low pass filter. So the trade-off is better 
detail at the expense of potential moire. Other than screen doors and a few 
fabrics, I haven't seen any moire that I'd worry about, though. Indeed, even in 
shots of birds and other animals with fine feathers or hairs I haven't seen 
color fringing or moire.</p> 
<p>In an earlier iteration of this review I wrote that &quot;near infrared is 
blocked more on this camera than on previous Nikon DSLRs.&quot; I'm adjusting 
that slightly: while the overall amount of near IR that is usable in IR imagry 
is less, there appears to be an abnormal blue channel response that contributes 
to noise and color shift, as noted above. Overall, yes, near IR response is 
down (Bjorn Rosslett reports that it's two stops different than the D100; it 
doesn't quite seem that much with the filter I use, but it<em>is</em> a 
noticeable difference). But the blue channel appears to respond to near IR 
light, which it shouldn't be doing (near IR should all be picked up only in the 
red channel). Whether this blue channel problem is limited to some camera 
bodies or is there for all D2h's made to date is unclear; many of us early 
users have encountered this problem, but others claim they haven't seen it.</p> 
<p>The final performance issue everyone wants to know about is one I'm not yet 
fully comfortable with writing in detail about: noise. As noted earlier, 
expectations were sky-high after Nikon's hype at the D2h launch. Some folk were 
simply expecting a camera that blew away all previous DSLRs in terms of noise 
(e.g., a camera that performed at ISO 1600 the way others do at ISO 100). Well, 
we need to peel those folk down from the ceiling and get them off the drugs 
they're using. As much as the next guy, I'd love to see a breakthrough in image 
noise tendencies. The D2h isn't it. That's not to say that it performs poorly, 
though. It's easily the equivalent of anything Nikon has done in the past, and, 
if I'm evaluating my images correctly, maybe even better up to a point.</p> 
<p>That's saying a lot, actually. The D2h's sensor is a new design from a new 
player in sensor design, and has a high bar to get over just to achieve parity 
with other sensors that are several generations old. I'm comfortable in saying 
that Nikon achieved parity or better, although the exact aspects of that are 
the stuff that require much more verbiage to describe accurately, especially 
given the near IR issue. I will say that the quality of the D2h noise is nice, 
at least up to ISO 800. By that I mean that it is random and more grain-like 
than the mosaic, banded, and color-blotched noise you often see in digital 
images. At high ISO values, though, the mosaic rears its head on the D2h, 
though banding seems pretty well under control on my sample. Even so, ISO 1600 
and even 3200 are quite usable with post production noise reduction--the 
primary loss is one of color saturation and contrast, not detail.</p> 
<p>Noise also shows up in underexposed images more readily. The D2h is not a 
camera you can shoot at anything other than proper exposure. Even a one stop 
underexposure will bring up the noise level, and two stops will make it 
noticeably visible. Fortunately, the metering system is accurate and flexible, 
so there's really no excuse for getting exposures wrong.</p> 
<p>One aspect of noise I can report on with positive results is long-exposure 
noise. There isn't any. Okay, that's a bit too extreme a statement, but it sure 
seems that way in comparison to the D1 series. Even though the D2h has a 
dark-frame subtraction noise reduction feature that can be set, I'm not really 
seeing the need for it until you get out to very long exposures. And by very 
long I mean<em>measured in minutes.</em> Even a five-minute exposure seems free 
of hot pixels and obvious dark current noise, though bringing up shadow detail 
reveals that there's some there. I consider this excellent performance.</p> 
<p>Is the D2h better than the D1h it replaced? Yes, by a long-shot in <em>every
</em> aspect of performance. The fact that people are asking for even more 
shows you just how far digital cameras are moving. Again, it would be nice to 
have 8mp and a bit better noise handling at high ISO values, but that's really 
about all that's necessary to put the D2h on the top of the heap again. The 
autofocus, exposure, flash, long-exposure noise, and color saturation 
performance of this camera are superb. Color accuracy is good with caveats that 
can be dealt with.</p> 
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><b><i>Potentially long reach for small hands</i></b><b><i>. </i></b>This 
is a big camera, and shooters with small hands won't find all the controls 
quite where they want them.</li> 
<li><b><i>Buffer could be bigger</i></b>. One disappointment to NEF shooters 
is that the buffer is no more than 16 images in size when noise reduction is on 
(14 when shooting compressed NEF with JPEG), 25 with it off. While that's still 
at least two seconds at 8 fps, it is a limit that you can reach while shooting 
intensive action.</li> 
<li><b><i>Requires SB-800 for best flash</i></b>. If you're going to get a 
D2h, be prepared to get at least one (and probably two) SB-800 Speedlights, as 
well. Flash is much better with i-TTL than it is with D-TTL, and you have more 
control and multiple flash TTL with the new system.</li> 
<li> <b><i>Wide isn't wide</i></b>. If you do scenic work, as I do, you need 
DX lenses to restore your wide angle due to the 1.5x angle of view change. And 
then you may find that you don't have enough megapixels for really large print 
sizes (I'm getting spoiled by theKodak Pro 14n's prodigious pixel creation).

<li><em><strong>Near IR pollution. </strong></em>The blue channel seems to 
respond to near IR, and a hot mirror filter fixes the problem. Ouch. We all 
thought this issue was gone after the Kodak DCS 2000 left the market.</li> </ul>
<h4>Positives</h4> 
<ul> 
<li><b><i>Fast.</i></b> Wow! Fast frame rate, fast mirror return, fast shutter 
lag, fast autofocus, fast, fast, fast. Repeat: Wow! If Nikon targeted action 
shooters with this camera (they did), they hit a bull's eye.</li> 
<li><b><i>Flexible and Controllable</i></b>. New controls, more options, and 
improved user control all around. Some of the stuff is minor (like the grouped 
and named Custom Settings), but it still adds up to making an already flexible 
camera even more so.</li> 
<li><b><i>Rugged. </i></b>Nicely built. Well weatherproofed, nothing sticking 
out to get clipped off in abusive handling, controls that are designed for use 
with gloves, magnesium alloy body with padding in the right places. Nikon has 
built the SLR hammer for the 21st century (the F being the original 20th 
century SLR hammer).</li> 
<li><em><strong>Flash</strong></em>. i-TTL works, and it restores multiple 
flash ability. No more needs to be said. Wedding photographers are going to 
swoon over the flash capabilities.</li> 
<li><em><strong>Excellent 4mp Image Quality</strong></em>. Acuity is good, 
color is excellent, and noise performance is at least as good as previous 
Nikons, if not better. With the right settings and discipline, this camera 
performs more like a 5mp or higher camera.</li> </ul> &nbsp;
