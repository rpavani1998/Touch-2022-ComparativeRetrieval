<h3>Leica M9-P / 18 MP Digital Rangefinder Camera body (black paint)</h3> 
<p>LEASE IT FROM JUST $268 / month <br>
Leica M9-P now features a gorgeous 
minimalist classic Leica look with a Sapphire LCD screen for better viewing in 
bright light and the screen is now virtually scratch-proof!<br>
<br>
The 
history of 35-mm photography began almost 100 years ago with the legendary 
Ur-Leica. Today, it is the Leica M9, a landmark camera that carries the proud 
heritage of Leica M cameras into the digital age. The Leica M9 is the world's 
first digital system camera of its size to be built with a full-frame sensor - 
a CCD sensor developed specifically for the M9 - that is capable of perfectly 
capturing the full 35-mm format (24 &times; 36 mm) in ultra-high resolution.</p>

with a full-frame sensor - a CCD sensor developed specifically for the M9 - 
that is capable of perfectly capturing the full 35-mm format (24 &times; 36 mm) 
in ultra-high resolution. The new M9 - in the familiar, classic, and timeless M 
design, represents the quintessence of its predecessors based on the consummate 
technological level of our time. It is the perfect contemporary tool for those 
who set the highest standards in image quality and are committed to creating 
images of enduring value.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FULL - FRAME 24 x 36 MM CAPTURE 
WITHOUT ANY COMPROMISES<br>
The combination of an extremely high-resolution 
sensor, high performance M lenses and careful processing of the digital picture 
data provides the best picture results under all conditions. The proprietry CCD 
sensor in the LEICA M9 with18 Million Pixels, allows the utilisation of the 
full 35 mm format. The sensor of the M9 uses a newly developed cover glass to 
eliminate infrared light contamination and allows the utilisation of existing 
Leica M lenses with out a loss of image quality. The use of external UV/IR 
filters is not required.<br>
<br>
INTUITIVE CONTROLS<br>
The simple handling 
and menus of the LEICA M9 allow the photographer to concentrate on taking 
pictures, not the controls. The key control element of the M9 is an intuitive 
four-way switch and dial combination used in conjunction with the 2.5-inch LCD 
monitor on the back. To set the ISO sensitivity, simply maintain light pressure 
on the ISO button while simultaneously turning the dial to select the required 
setting. All other functions important for everyday situations are quickly and 
easily accessible by pressing the set button: white balance, image-data 
compression, resolution, exposure correction, exposure bracketing, and 
programmable user profiles. The user profiles can be programmed with any 
combination of camera and shooting settings, stored under an assigned name, and 
accessed quickly whenever required for a particular situation.<br>
<br>
<br>

COMPACT, ENDURING PERFORMANCE AND VALUE<br>
It is hardly unusual that a Leica, 
once owned, becomes a lifelong companion. This also applies to the digital M9: 
In spite of the larger sensor size, the compact housing of the M8 and M8.2 was 
being retained. With exterior dimensions of 139 x 37 x 80 mm (5.5 x 1.5 x 3.1 
in) it maintains the ideal shape of the M camera and becomes the smallest full 
frame system camera in the world. Its closed, full-metal housing, crafted from 
a high-strength magnesium alloy, and its top deck and bottom plate machined 
from large blocks of brass, provide perfect protection for its precious inner 
mechanisms. The digital components and shutter assembly of the M9 are similarly 
constructed with endurance in mind. Free firmware updates ensure that the 
camera benefits from the latest technology. In short: The Leica M9 is an 
investment for a lifetime. The camera is available in classic black vulcanit 
finish or elegant steel grey with traditional fine leatherette finish. M9-P 
comes in either black paint or chrome.<br>

24 mm f/2.8 ASPH.<br>

<p> More Details </p> Classics are works that are immune to the passing whims 
of the present. They are never rewritten, but re-interpreted on the basis of a 
changed world. The analog Leica M7 is such a classic. Silver halide photography 
with a Leica M has a special appeal: the understandable process of exposing the 
film and the chemical processing of the same piece of material create an 
emotional relationship with the subject and the camera. The concentration when 
taking the photograph, the keen anticipation of the literally tangible images 
and the excellent results are all arguments in favour of analog Leica M cameras.

Intuitive photography<br>
As an alternative to the familiar 
manual method of exposure adjustment - which, of course, can still be used - 
the Leica M7 offers a convenient, continuously variable, aperture priority mode 
with an exposure lock via the shutter release. This allows you to focus easily, 
compose quickly and thus devote your full attention to taking the photograph.

Versatile exposure<br>
With its range of intelligent 
features, the M7 gives you many options for picture composition. TTL flash 
exposure measurement takes the risk out of flash photography. Creative latitude 
is offered by synchronisation times down to 1/1000 s and flash synchronisation 
at the second shutter curtain. Viewfinder displays facilitate photography with 
long exposure times.<br>

Work in comfort<br>
Ergonomically 
located right next to the shutter release button, the ON/OFF button activates 
the electronics of the Leica M7 and also disables the shutter release when the 
camera is switched off. There is now a choice of either manual or automatic 
film speed setting (DX coding), eliminating the risk of annoying exposure 
errors due to wrong ISO settings. The stepless aperture priority mode ensures 
reliable and precise exposure. And a system that is unique for rangefinder 
cameras gives a clearly legible display of all the information in the 
viewfinder of the Leica M7 - even in critical side light. <br>

<p> More Details </p> Classics are works that are immune to the passing whims 
of the present. They are never rewritten, but re-interpreted on the basis of a 
changed world. The analog Leica M7 is such a classic. Silver halide photography 
with a Leica M has a special appeal: the understandable process of exposing the 
film and the chemical processing of the same piece of material create an 
emotional relationship with the subject and the camera. The concentration when 
taking the photograph, the keen anticipation of the literally tangible images 
and the excellent results are all arguments in favour of analog Leica M cameras.
